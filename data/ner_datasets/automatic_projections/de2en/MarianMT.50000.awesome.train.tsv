Discussions O
on O
asylum O
seekers O
, O
resettlement O
and O
immigration O
issues O
have O
dominated O
politics O
and O
the O
media O
in O
Germany B-LOC
in O
recent O
months O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
not O
difficult O
at O
the O
moment O
to O
attract O
attention O
with O
the O
publication O
of O
a O
book O
on O
refugees O
and O
displaced O
persons O
in O
West B-LOC
Germany I-LOC
from O
1945 O
to O
1990 O
. O

And O
indeed O
, O
there O
are O
hardly O
any O
serious O
scientific O
discussions O
that O
have O
taken O
up O
this O
issue O
so O
far O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
questionable O
whether O
such O
a O
topicality O
must O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
a O
doubtless O
forthcoming O
debate O
to O
deprive O
its O
core O
in O

of O

the O

Albrecht B-PER
Lehmann I-PER
, O
in O
his O
book B-MISC
I I-MISC
m O
Freu√üer O
unintentionally O
at O
home O
, O
tries O
to O
adopt O
a O
neutral O
perspective O
, O
free O
of O
blame O
and O
innocency O
, O
against O
a O
policy O
and O
its O
consequences O
, O
which O
led O
to O
twelve O
million O
people O
fleeing O
or O
displaced O
from O
East O
Germany O
and O
the O
German O
settlement O
areas O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
. O

In O
what O
way O
the O
" O
refugees O
" O
- O
as O
it O
was O
called O
immediately O
after O
the O
war O
with O
a O
pejorative O
bytaste O
- O
or O
" O
displaced O
" O
- O
so O
the O
common O
name O
since O
c. O

1948 O
- O
found O
in O
their O
new O
circumstances O
and O
how O
these O
experiences O
have O
traded O
over O
the O
next O
decades O
in O
the O
different O
generations O
to O
today O
, O
Lehmann B-PER
demonstrates O
by O
means O
of O
a O
series O
of O
narratives O
, O
personal O
records O
, O
diaries O
and O
documents O
of O
the O
displaced O
press O
. O

Today O
, O
a O
picture O
is O
promoted O
, O
which O
is O
not O
surprising O
, O
but O
in O
its O
compilation O
convincingly O
allows O
readers O
to O
carry O
out O
a O
specific O
kind O
of O
foreignness O
experience O
. O

The O
respective O
experiences O
and O
their O
coping O
are O
presented O
very O
differently O
. O

However O
, O
certain O
topics O
appear O
again O
and O
again O
: O

Thus O
, O
the O
rape O
of O
German B-MISC
women O
by O
members O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
not O
only O
led O
to O
irreparable O
mental O
disorders O
among O
women O
themselves O
, O
but O
also O
to O
complicated O
marriage O
relationships O
that O
dominated O
the O
lives O
of O
whole O
families O
often O
for O
years O
after O
these O
events O
. O

The O
uprooting O
from O
the O
old O
homeland O
produced O
in O
quite O
a O
few O
cases O
forms O
of O
social O
over O
- O
adjustment O
, O
which O
caused O
difficulties O
with O
the O
old O
- O
established O
population O
, O
especially O
in O
narrow O
village O
communities O
. O

A O
" O
sentimental O
perseverance O
" O
on O
old O
traditions O
and O
customs O
expressed O
how O
incapable O
the O
displaced O
were O
to O
forget O
the O
old O

In O
all O
narratives O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
the O
pursuit O
of O
social O
harmony O
has O
been O
a O
guiding O
factor O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
creation O
of O
a O
new O
sense O
of O
community O
should O
compensate O
for O
the O
loss O
experienced O
in O
most O
cases O
as O
a O
cruel O

In O
addition O
to O
showing O
such O
typical O
difficulties O
, O
a O
strength O
of O
the O
book O
is O
to O
highlight O
the O
differences O
in O
the O
experiences O
of O
different O
generations O
. O

Thus O
it O
is O
plausible O
that O
the O
generation O
that O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
sixties O
and O
seventies O
wanted O
little O
to O
do O
with O
the O
past O
of O
their O
parents O
who O
had O
been O
expelled O
. O

A O
consciousness O
about O
the O
" O
lost O
home O
" O
existed O
; O
however O
, O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
sentimentally O
occupied O
. O

This O
changed O
only O
in O
the O
1980s O
, O
when O
in O
Germany B-LOC
a O
renaissance O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
homeland O
allowed O
a O
stronger O
reference O
to O
the O
former O
German B-MISC
settlement O
areas O
again O
. O

Lehmann B-PER
is O
not O
tired O
in O
the O
description O
and O
reproduction O
of O
the O
stories O
of O
displaced O
persons O
, O
repeatedly O
pointing O
out O
that O
, O
despite O
long O
- O
tamed O
prejudices O
, O
they O
do O
not O
attach O
any O
revanchism O
. O

One O
may O
believe O
the O
author O
, O
who O
understands O
his O
book O
as O
a O
contribution O
to O
the O
understanding O
of O
different O
nations O
, O
when O
he O
calls O
in O
this O
sense O
to O
understand O
the O
old O
homeland O
only O
as O
a O
" O
home O
in O
the O
head O
" O
. O

However O
, O
despite O
this O
certainly O
laudable O
attitude O
and O
programmatics O
, O
the O
many O
reports O
and O
narratives O
leave O
a O
pale O
aftertaste O
, O
which O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
methodology O
of O
German B-MISC
ethnology O
. O

History O
, O
as O
it O
is O
written O
in O
this O
book O
, O
is O
primarily O
reproduced O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
those O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

The O
one O
story O
decays O
into O
many O
narratives O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
can O
be O
classified O
scientifically O
according O
to O
different O
genres O
. O

So O
success O
stories O
, O
swans O
and O
trump O
stories O
are O
typical O
forms O
of O
narrating O
a O
particular O
group O
, O
which O
today O
still O
want O
to O
forget O
their O
initial O
difficulties O
in O
the O
new O
home O
. O

A O
ousting O
form O
of O
narration O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
to O
be O
found O
among O
women O
who O
have O
become O
victims O
of O
rape O
. O

However O
, O
this O
scientifically O
derived O
classification O
of O
narrative O
types O
remains O
only O
external O
. O

The O
narratives O
themselves O
are O
central O
in O
the O
form O
of O
presentation O
available O
here O
; O
a O
reflection O
on O
them O
and O
thus O
a O
possibility O
of O
evaluation O
and O
classification O
remains O

This O
, O
however O
, O
makes O
it O
all O
too O
easy O
for O
compassionate O
understanding O
or O
sympathetic O
identification O
with O
those O
affected O
to O
forget O
those O
constellations O
of O
history O
, O
in O
the O
context O
of O
which O
the O
unquestionably O
cruel O
individual O
events O
should O
necessarily O
be O
presented O
. O

For O
example O
, O
it O
seems O
quite O
irritating O
when O
the O
" O
double O
luck O
" O
of O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
from O
Transylvania B-LOC
is O
reported O
, O
who O
as O
a O
people B-MISC
German I-MISC
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
join O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
, O
but O
had O
to O
become O
the O
Waffen B-ORG
- I-ORG
SS I-ORG
; O
which O
could O
thus O
save O
itself O
over O
the O
war O
years O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
was O
spared O
from O
the O
prisoner O
of O
war O
. O

To O
imagine O
the O
happiness O
of O
an O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
is O
one O
side O
. O

The O
other O
must O
be O
to O
place O
the O
individual O
fates O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
and O
the O
years O
thereafter O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
an O
objective O
perspective O
can O
be O
taken O

It O
is O
a O
mistake O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
mere O
reproduction O
of O
authentic O
reports O
must O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
an O
appropriate O
view O
of O
history O
. O

Rather O
, O
it O
risks O
looking O
at O
history O
, O
which O
stylizes O
all O
those O
involved O
to O
their O
victims O
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
also O
deal O
with O
the O
victims O
of O
history O
who O
were O
on O
the O
perpetrator O
's O
side O
. O

However O
, O
it O
should O
be O
avoided O
in O
doing O
so O
, O
to O
promote O
a O
relativisation O
of O
history O
, O
which O
seeks O
to O
blur O
all O
differences O
in O
favour O
of O
an O
" O
understood O
understanding O
" O
. O

In O
this O
context O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
spend O
programmatic O
slogans O
on O
" O
Reconciliation O
of O
all O
cultures O
" O
. O

This O
leads O
to O
other O
fundamental O
misunderstandings O
that O
contribute O
to O
the O
blurring O
of O
crucial O
differences O
. O

In O
Lehmann B-PER
's O
case O
, O
this O
blurry O
is O
most O
evident O
where O
he O
advocates O
a O
" O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
" O
and O
declares O
this O
to O
be O
a O
perspective O
that O
should O
emerge O
from O
a O
non O
- O
revanchist O
resettlement O
perspective O
, O
so O
that O
the O
German B-MISC
solution O
to O
the O
resettlement O
problem O
becomes O
a O
model O
for O
those O
questions O
and O
problems O
arising O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
immigration O
movements O
: O

" O
The O
theme O
of O
this O
book O
remains O
current O
: O

The O
question O
of O
how O
individuals O
and O
families O
with O
their O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
find O
a O
new O
home O
in O
our O
country O
, O
in O
which O
images O
of O
memory O
they O
carry O
and O
trade O
the O
old O
home O
and O
the O
culture O
of O
the O
region O
of O
origin O
, O
in O
which O
way O
they O
maintain O
contact O
with O
the O
first O
home O
. O
" O

In O
the O
equation O
of O
the O
problems O
of O
resettlement O
and O
asylum O
seekers O
as O
well O
as O
their O
respective O
experiences O
of O
foreignness O
, O
the O
fundamental O
difference O
between O
these O
groups O
is O
swept O
under O
the O
table O
. O

A O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
consists O
in O
the O
cohabitation O
of O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
ethnic O
groups O
, O
which O
it O
has O
forcibly O
or O
deliberately O
led O
to O
Germany B-LOC
or O
other O
European B-LOC
countries O
. O

However O
, O
these O
groups O
' O
experiences O
of O
alienity O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
fundamentally O
different O
from O
those O
of O
the O
resettlements O
of O
the O
forties O
or O
those O
of O
their O
children O
decades O

The O
latter O
have O
been O
proven O
to O
have O
identified O
with O
Germany B-LOC
despite O
the O
losses O
of O
the O
" O
old O
homeland O
in O
the O
East O
" O
, O
have O
built O
up O
a O
national O
consciousness O
due O
to O
their O
ethnicity O
. O

Such O
identification O
is O
neither O
possible O
nor O
desirable O
for O
immigrants O
. O

While O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
homogeneous O
nation O
state O
was O
decisive O
for O
the O
resettlement O
, O
it O
is O
today O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
heterogeneous O
nation O
state O
for O
asylum O
seekers O
and O
immigrants O
. O

A O
focus O
on O
subjective O
sensitivities O
, O
as O
set O
out O
in O
this O
volume O
, O
should O
not O
lead O
to O
neglecting O
fundamental O
, O
objective O
differences O
. O

This O
does O
not O

Andrea B-PER
recognized O

took O
the O
initiative O

registered O
in O
a O

for O

A O
few O
weeks O

, O
she O
left O
her O

for O
three O
months O
of O

The O
relatives O
accused O
her O
of O
being O
a O
raven O

For O
Andrea B-PER
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
clear O

" O
I O
can O
only O
be O
a O

Sociology O
is O
not O
without O
reason O
the O
suspicion O
of O
high O
stacking O

For O
it O
claims O
nothing O
less O
than O
its O
specific O
subject O
- O
matter O
than O
the O
whole O
of O
society O
. O

What O
is O
surprising O
is O
that O
the O
society O
so O
targeted O
reacted O
suspiciously O
to O
the O
acquisition O
by O

. O

Until O

by O

was O
only O
in O

that O
she O

The O
Society B-ORG
of I-ORG
Sociology I-ORG
fell O
blushingly O
into O
the O
arms O
. O

This O
yes O
word O
has O
led O
to O
a O
covenant O
for O
life O
, O
but O
it O
has O
become O
anything O
but O
a O
fervent O
love O
relationship O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
enthusiasm O
behind O
the O
expectations O
of O
this O
young O
social O
science O
was O
at O
the O
height O
of O
its O
academic O
expansion O
. O

The O
conviction O
, O
which O
was O
combined O
with O
that O
demanding O
objective O
of O
knowledge O
, O
diminished O
to O
formulate O
a O
theory O
of O
the O
whole O
society O
, O
which O
should O
at O
the O
same O
time O
be O
critical O
and O
practically O
changing O
. O

Are O
we O
therefore O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
process O
in O
which O
the O
utopian O
energies O
, O
which O
were O
invested O
in O
the O
enormous O
enterprise O
of O
a O
revolution O
of O
all O
outdated O
working O
and O
living O
conditions O
to O
be O
brought O
about O
by O
enlightenment O
and O

, O

In O
other O
words O
: O

How O
can O
the O
attractiveness O
of O
sociology O
be O
regained O
as O
a O
reality O
- O
changing O
force O
which O
it O
lost O
in O
the O
course O
of O
its O
" O

process O

to O
normal O
science O
? O

There O
are O
three O
main O
reasons O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
utopia O
in O
sociology O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
the O
utopia O
itself O
, O
which O
has O
become O
modest O
from O
the O
historical O
experiences O
of O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
great O
visionary O
promises O
, O
which O
have O
emerged O
from O
the O
historical O
upsurge O
of O
recent O
times O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
increasingly O
concrete O
utopian O
challenge O
has O
arisen O
through O
the O
simple O
cunning O
of O
the O
realization O
of O
utopian O
ideals O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
historical O
situation O
has O
assumed O
a O
gravity O
that O
allows O
any O
longing O
projection O
of O
a O
completely O
different O
in O
the O
morning O
only O
as O
an O
apocalypse O
. O

In O
the O
critical O
tradition O
of O
social O
theory O
, O
the O
ideals O
at O
the O
origin O
of O
modernity O
were O
transformed O
into O
the O
concrete O
utopia O
of O
the O
real O
history O
of O
progressive O
bourgeois O
emancipation O
. O

The O
ladder O
goes O
from O
the O
fictitious O
future O
paintings O
of O
a O
Morus B-PER
, O
Campanella B-PER
and O
Bacon B-PER
to O
the O
technical O
and O
early O
socialist O
utopianism O
of O
an O
Owen B-PER
, O
Saint B-PER
- I-PER
Simon I-PER
, O
Fourier B-PER
and O
Proudhon B-PER
. O

Against O
these O
utopian O
socialists O
Marx B-PER
polemized O
with O
all O
the O
sharpness O
that O
accused O
them O
of O
being O
mere O
dreamers O
. O

He O
himself O
puts O
like O
so O
much O
, O
so O
also O
the O
utopia O
from O
the O
head O
on O
the O
feet O
and O
comes O
materialistic O
to O
the O
point O
: O

In O
communism O
, O
utopia O
and O
reality O
merge O
as O
the O
society O
of O
free O
producers O
, O
as O
material O
abundance O
and O
as O
transparent O
social O
relations O
for O
all O
members O
of O
society O
. O

However O
, O
this O
concretization O
of O
utopia O
has O
not O
led O
anyone O
to O
Paradise O
, O
which O
was O
promised O
. O

For O
, O
as O
we O
read O

consists O
in O

This O
hope O
for O

" O
by O
Ulrich B-PER
Beck I-PER
is O
by O
no O

new O
. O

In O
order O
to O
avoid O
the O
foreseeable O
catastrophe O
, O
already O
leading O
sociologists O
of O
the O
Weimar B-MISC
era I-MISC
such O
as O
Max B-PER
Weber I-PER
and O
Karl B-PER
Mannheim I-PER
argued O
that O
the O
real O
approach O
to O

concrete O
Utopian O
is O
. O

And O
in O
fact O

Rule O
of O
law O
, O
democratic O
self O
- O
determination O
and O
material O
welfare O
are O
nothing O
more O
than O
an O
unenchanted O
form O
of O
the O
realization O
of O
the O
utopia O
that O
has O
long O
been O
brought O
to O
earth O
from O

: O

Everyone O
produces O
according O
to O
their O

, O
everyone O

This O
secularized O

of O
the O

of O

to O

however O

is O
currently O
overtaken O

more O
precisely O

by O
a O
kind O

This O

with O
which O
the O

Claus B-PER

entered O

out O
from O

processes O

To O

however O
, O
is O
not O
much O
more O
than O
a O
residual O
hope O
to O
escape O
the O
unstoppable O
disaster O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
generalisation O
of O
the O
principle O
" O

for O
free O
citizens O
" O
by O
pause O
and O
standstill O
. O

Is O
this O
utopia O
not O
a O
threat O
to O
the O
banishment O
of O
the O
omnipotence O
of O
the O
present O
? O

As O
the O
critical O
force O
of O
utopian O
thought O
fades O
in O
Enlightenment O
Science O
, O
the O
dimension O
of O
historical O
meaning O
formation O
in O
the O
horizon O
of O
historical O
target O
perspectives O
disappears O
in O
social O
self O
- O
thematization O
. O

This O
vacuum O
is O
not O
only O
a O
breeding O
ground O
for O
ideologies O
such O
as O
that O
of O
posthistoire O
, O
but O
this O
utopianism O
also O
promotes O
the O
fixation O
of O
replacement O
programs O
such O
as O
fundamentalism O
, O
regionalism O
and O
feminism O
. O

It O
lacks O
the O
memory O
of O
what O
is O
unrequited O
in O
utopian O
thinking O
, O
it O
is O
dispensed O
with O
that O
utopian O
forward O
thinking O
that O
strikes O
the O
spark O
that O
can O
ignite O
the O
light O
with O
which O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
better O
society O
goes O
along O
. O

A O
disciplinaryly O
organised O
science O
business O
is O
objectively O
overburdened O
against O
the O
risks O
of O
the O
risk O
society O
. O

For O
the O
growing O
destructive O
potentials O
in O
nature O
and O
society O
generated O
by O
the O
individual O
sciences O
themselves O
have O
their O
reason O
, O
not O
least O
because O
the O
subjects O
only O
operate O
navel O
shows O
and O
remain O
in O
their O
ivory O
towers O
. O

In O
this O
imperative O
multidisciplinary O
cooperation O
of O
the O
natural O
, O
humanities O
and O
social O
sciences O
, O
the O
science O
grows O
a O
special O
responsibility O
from O
society O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
its O
object O
relation O
to O
the O
totality O
of O
the O
social O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
sociology O
has O
the O
self O
- O
critical O
task O
of O
returning O
to O
its O
own O
home O
and O
acting O
contagious O
by O
this O
exemplary O
nature O
. O

Only O
as O
a O
" O
house O
of O
open O
doors O
" O
with O
internal O
plurality O
enables O
a O
process O
of O
combining O
diverse O
methods O
and O
theories O
. O

The O
cognitive O
identity O
of O
sociology O
is O
by O
no O
means O
endangered O
by O
this O
openness O
, O
since O
the O
subject O
has O
stabilised O
itself O
organizationally O
and O
seems O
to O
secure O
its O
academic O
reputation O
. O

Their O
status O
of O
interpretational O
science O
requires O
the O
practice O
of O
extreme O
tolerance O
to O
the O
competing O
paradigms O
, O
different O
methodological O
approaches O
and O
the O
divergent O
interpretation O
of O
social O
issues O
. O

Because O
social O
analyses O
can O
not O
operate O
with O
an O
objectiveistic O
claim O
to O
knowledge O
. O

Rather O
, O
social O
theory O
convinces O
through O
the O
formation O
of O
arguments O
, O
i.e. O
through O
empirical O
prudence O
and O
interpretative O
plausibility O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
future O
of O
sociology O
lies O
in O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
unity O
of O
traditions O
that O
originally O
diverge O
: O

the O
experiential O
method O
of O
cognition O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
the O
hermeneutics O
of O
the O
humanities O
on O
the O

This O
principle O
of O
tolerance O
in O
one O
's O
own O
house O
also O
implies O
a O
direct O
connection O
to O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
same O
street O
, O
i.e. O
the O
strict O
cooperation O
of O
sociology O
with O
other O
social O
sciences O
, O
if O
it O
does O
not O
want O
to O
reveal O
its O
great O
objective O
of O
knowledge O
, O
which O
according O
to O
Horkheimer O
consists O
in O
formulating O
a O
theory O
of O
the O
historical O
course O
of O
the O
epoch O
. O

This O
gigantic O
research O
program O
can O
only O
be O
realized O
if O
sociology O
becomes O
the O
vehicle O
of O
communication O
between O
the O
subjects O
of O
history O
, O
economics O
, O
anthropology O
, O
ethnology O
and O
psychology O
, O
among O
others O
, O
which O
are O
jointly O
engaged O
in O
a O
philosophical O
fundamental O
reflection O
, O
are O
ready O
for O
a O
continuous O
exchange O
of O

scientific O
knowledge O
progress O
and O
systematically O
link O
the O
empirical O
research O
efforts O
with O
the O
formation O
of O
theory O
. O

This O
orientation O
of O
the O
social O
sciences O
towards O
a O
historical O
and O
empirically O
substantial O
theory O
of O
the O
social O
one O
to O
be O
developed O
through O
research O
cooperation O
is O
only O
a O
first O
step O
. O

A O
second O
one O
must O
follow O

For O
the O
increasingly O
specialized O
social O
sciences O
rinsing O
the O
object O
of O
their O
research O
efforts O
not O
only O
between O
the O
fingers O
, O
but O
the O
meaning O
of O
their O
teaching O
and O
research O
is O
limited O
to O
the O
work O
of O
the O
shoemaker O
who O
remains O
with O
his O
groin O
, O
the O
water O
may O
also O
stand O
to O
his O

. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
future O
perspective O
of O
the O
humanities O
and O
social O
sciences O
lies O
in O
the O
emerging O
coalition O
of O
human O
sciences O
. O

According O
to O
the O
American B-MISC
historian O
Robert B-PER
Darnton I-PER
, O
a O
new O
configuration O
of O
subjects O
, O
which O
consequently O
involves O
the O
dissolution O
of O
traditional O
faculties O
and O
departments O
, O
leads O
to O
a O
boost O
of O
innovation O
: O

The O
one O
- O
dimensionality O
of O
cause O
and O
event O
research O
is O
overcome O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
reality O
- O
scientific O
understanding O
of O
the O
symbolic O
cultural O
system O
as O
the O
common O
point O
of O
reference O
of O
the O
human O
sciences O

Let O
's O
sum O
up O
: O

sociology O
must O
first O
recognise O
the O
status O
of O
an O
empirical O
, O
understanding O
and O
critical O
social O
science O
not O
only O
for O
itself O
, O
but O
also O
productively O
exploit O
its O
character O
as O
a O
multi O
- O
paradigm O
science O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
project O
requires O
a O
restructured O
social O
theory O
of O
interdisciplinary O
cooperation O
among O
the O
various O
subjects O
of O
social O
science O
. O

Finally O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
its O
perspective O
on O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
human O
life O
context O
, O
science O
from O
society O
is O
best O
suited O
to O
bring O
to O
the O
fore O
an O
overall O
interest O
of O
humanity O
in O
the O
dangerous O
activity O
of O
the O
cultivating O
sorcerers O
of O
technical O
- O
scientific O
civilization O
, O
the O
independent O
individual O
sciences O
with O
their O
particularistic O
rationalities O
. O

The O
present O
task O
of O
sociology O
is O
to O
bring O
, O
through O
its O
interpretive O
translation O
and O
mediation O
services O
, O
the O
sciences O
, O
whose O
differentiation O
is O
irreversible O
, O
to O
the O
common O
denominator O
of O
a O
multidisciplinary O
discourse O
, O
which O
seeks O
to O
solve O
a O
binding O
question O
: O

how O
to O
prevent O
the O
disaster O
. O

The O
treatment O
of O
this O
existential O
question O
certainly O
does O
not O
succeed O
as O
a O
stroke O
of O
genius O
by O
a O
researcher O
or O
a O
specialist O
, O
but O
is O
only O
conceivable O
as O
a O
joint O
work O
of O
all O
sciences O
. O

From O
this O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
Enlightenment O
Science O
is O
the O
protagonist O
of O
a O
utopian O
program O
: O

that O
of O
overcoming O
disciplinary O
boundaries O
. O

The O
indifferent O
juxtaposition O
of O

The O

their O

then O
divided O
the O
jewelry O
among O
themselves O
and O
sold O
piece O

piece O

In O
the O
next O
decades O
the O
jewels O
appeared O
in O
various O
places O
and O
among O
the O
most O
diverse O
owners O
. O

Some O
parts O
were O
also O
considered O
completely O
lost O

The O
eagle B-MISC
- I-MISC
peacock I-MISC
- O
fibel O
is O
the O
prototype O
of O
a O
fibelform B-MISC
, O
of O
which O
so O
far O
only O
three O
specimens O
are O
known O
, O
which O
, O
as O
reported O
by O
the O
upper O
conservator O
, O
also O
all O
come O
from O
Mainz B-LOC
. O

The O
common O
characteristic O
of O
these O
three O
disc O
fibulas O
is O
that O
the O
eagle O
is O
depicted O
with O
a O
peacock O
crown O
made O
of O
expanded O
wings O
. O

This O
mixture O
of O
eagle O
and O
peacock O
is O
based O
on O
a O
profoundly O
Christian O
meaning O
: O

The O
eagle O
symbolizes O
resurrection O
and O
ascension O
of O
Christ B-PER
, O
the O
peacock O
eternal O
life O
. O

That O
this O
crowned O
bird O
was O
at O
the O
same O
time O
regarded O
as O
an O
imperial O
sign O
of O
sovereignty O
and O
forerunner O
of O
the O
Staufian O
imperial B-MISC
eagle I-MISC
is O
also O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
temporal O
classification O
. O

Its O
body O
shape O
in O
frontal O
view O
, O
only O
the O
head O
in O
profile O
, O
obviously O
dates O
back O
to O
Islamic O
art O
in O
the O
10th O
century O
. O

Stylistically O
, O
the O
most O
beautiful O
and O
" O
most O
quality O
" O
of O
the O
three O
eagle O
fibulas O
has O
novel O
dimensions O
. O

Instead O
of O
the O
formerly O
broad O
- O
edge O
framed O
small O
center O
, O
here O
the O
dominant O
large O
motif O
is O
surrounded O
by O
a O
now O
narrow O
edge O
. O

Another O
indication O
for O
the O
dating O
of O
this O
broken O
enamel O
fibula O
into O
the O
middle O
11th O
century O
are O
small O
flower O
stems O
made O
of O
gold O
wire O
at O
the O
roundings O
and O
pearl O
wire O
lines O
at O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
peacock O
wheel O
. O

Where O
and O
by O
whom O
the O
precious O
jewelry O
was O
made O
, O
can O
only O
be O
guessed O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
indicate O
Byzantine B-MISC
or O
Italian B-MISC
goldsmiths O
who O
were O
perhaps O
immigrating O
at O
that O
time O
or O
who O
had O
been O
living O
in O
Mainz B-LOC
for O
some O
time O
. O

Because O
Mainz B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
high O
Middle O
Ages O
called O
" O
diadem B-MISC
of I-MISC
the O
empire O
" O
, O
was O
in O
the O
Salierzeit B-MISC
the O
city O
with O
most O
royal O
stays O
and O
owned O
jewelry O
workshops O
of O
supraregional O
importance O
, O
whose O
traces O
can O
still O
be O
detected O

on O
the O
old O
Rhine O
bank O
by O
lead O
waste O
, O
raw O
casts O
and O
semi O
- O

. O

Since O
the O
overwhelming O
number O
of O
jewels O
originates O
from O
the O
middle O
third O
of O
the O
11th O
century O
, O
it O
will O
be O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
attributed O
to O
Agnes B-PER
of I-PER
Poitou I-PER
, O
Mechthild B-PER
Schulze I-PER
- O
D√∂rlamm O
believes O
, O
especially O
since O

finger O

with O
the O
image O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
the O
Emperor O
Henry B-PER

, O
is O
preserved O
. O

With O
the O
gift O
certificates O
issued O
immediately O
after O
the O
wedding O
on O
extended O
lands O
and O
possessions O
, O
Henry B-PER
III I-PER
made O
them O
one O
of O
the O
most O
equipped O
queens O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
medieval O
empire O
; O
whether O
as O
an O
expression O
of O
his O
affection O
or O
foreseeing O
independent O
provision O
for O
a O
" O
foreign O
" O
ruler O
, O
is O
not O
handed O
down O
. O

That O
this O
wealthy O
Empress O
could O
have O
pledged O
her O
entire O
jewelry O
to O
a O
Jewish O
merchant O
by O
herself O
is O
unlikely O
. O

It O
would O
be O
conceivable O
that O
Agnes B-PER

16 O

Henry B-PER

, O
with O
whom O
almost O
a O
year O
younger O
Bertha B-PER
of I-PER
Turin I-PER
- O
officially O
handed O
over O
the O
jewellery O
to O
her O
daughter O
- O
in O
- O
law O
for O
a O
gift O
. O

Bertha B-PER
almost O
belonged O
to O
the O
family O
, O
since O
she O
had O
already O
renounced O
the O
throne O
as O
a O
young O
girl O
and O
had O
withdrawn O
to O
an O
Italian B-MISC
monastery O
, O
where O
she O
no O
longer O
needed O
the O
representative O

. O

When O
Empress O
Bertha B-PER
now O
died O
in O
Mainz B-LOC
in O
1087 O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Henry B-PER
IV I-PER
equipped O
his O
third O
Rome O
campaign O
and O
had O
to O
fight O
again O
with O
money O
difficulties O
because O
of O
his O
numerous O
campaigns O
, O
it O
could O
have O
been O
possible O
that O

circumstances O
he O
has O
pledged O
the O

his O
deceased O

" O

That O
the O

its O

unusual O

church O

usually O
the O

which O
you O
need O
right O

you O
hire O
an O

This O

body O
of O
the O
" O

for O
the O
Disabled O

these O
days O
after O

in O
Berlin B-LOC

Renowned O
gynaecologists O
, O
obstetricians O
, O
human O
geneticists O
and O
laboratory O

had O
participated O

a O
number O

demands O

As O
the O

, O
Professor O
Joachim B-PER
Wolfram I-PER
Dudenhausen I-PER
of O
the O
Rudolf B-ORG
Virchow I-ORG
Clinic I-ORG
of O
the O
Free B-ORG
University I-ORG
of O
Berlin O
, O
explained O
, O
the O
basically O
harmless O
, O
but O
costly O
test O
, O
when O
it O
provides O
evidence O
of O
genetic O
damage O
such O
as O
neural O
tube O
defects O
or O
for O
trisomies O
( O
as O
the O
formerly O
called O
down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
) O
, O
draws O
further O
elaborate O
and O
for O
the O
woman O
and O
the O
unborn O
not O
quite O
harmless O
investigations O
after O
itself O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
amniocentesis O
. O

A O
great O
many O
of O
these O
interventions O
are O
, O
according O
to O
the O
consultants O
, O
unnecessary O
and O
should O
be O
spared O
to O
pregnant O
women O
. O

Just O
as O
Triple O
Diagnostics O
is O
handled O
today O
, O
it O
too O
often O
provides O
evidence O
of O
a O
genetic O
risk O
that O
can O
not O
be O
confirmed O
with O
amniocentesis O
. O

According O
to O
Professor O
Dudenhausen B-PER
, O
these O
deficiencies O
have O
less O
to O
do O
with O
the O
difficulties O
of O
laboratory O
testing O
, O
with O
which O
biochemically O
three O
childlike O
substances O
are O
measured O
in O
maternal O
blood O
( O
alpha O
- O
fetoprotein O
, O
chorionic O
gonadotropins O
and O
ostriol O
) O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
test O
is O
affected O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
doctor O
often O
does O
not O
determine O
the O
exact O
age O
of O
the O
unborn O
child O
before O
taking O
the O
blood O
, O
and O
that O
the O
blood O
values O
then O
, O
when O
the O
child O
is O
older O
than O
suspected O
, O
pre O
- O
reflect O
a O
non O
- O
existent O
risk O
. O

The O
experts O
therefore O
require O
that O
the O
test O
be O
carried O
out O
using O
ultrasound O
only O
when O
the O
foetus O
is O
aged O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

As O
Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
added O
, O
a O
prior O
consultation O
of O
pregnant O
women O
is O
also O
indispensable O
. O

It O
was O
intended O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
the O
expectant O
mothers O
that O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
test O
only O
detects O
a O
down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
in O
six O
out O
of O
ten O
cases O
and O
generally O
only O
a O
small O
part O
of O
all O
possible O
genetic O
damage O
is O

Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
: O

" O
We O
can O
not O
give O
a O
guarantee O
certificate O
for O
the O
birth O
of O
a O
healthy O
child O

" O

The O
suitability O
of O
the O
test O
under O
accompanying O
advice O
and O
ultrasonic O
control O
had O

Several O
series O
of O
examinations O
are O
being O

at O
German B-MISC
hospitals O
, O
according O
to O
the O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
G√∂ttingen I-ORG
, O
where O
more O
than O
10,000 O
mothers O
have O
been O
tested O
so O
far O
. O

Concerning O
the O
possible O
consequence O
of O
abortion O
, O
the O
consultants O
also O
consider O
that O
the O
test O
is O
only O
applicable O
relatively O
late O
, O
between O
the O
15th O
and O
18th O
weeks O
of O

. O

Here O
they O
hope O
that O
the O
new O
development O
of O
a O
blood O
test O
, O
in O
which O
placenta O
proteins O
are O
examined O
, O
will O

The O
Boeing B-MISC

came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
number O
of O

of O
an O

less O

than O
was O

were O

It O
immediately O

up O

in O

are O
called O
, O
initially O
also O
had O
the O
approval O
authorities O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
the O
rule O
was O
that O
two O
- O

commercial O
aircraft O
would O
have O
to O
set O
up O
their O
route O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
they O
could O
reach O

in O
at O
least O
60 O
minutes O
in O
the O
event O
of O
an O

. O

This O
meant O
that O

such O
as O
the O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
line I-MISC
for O
two O
- O
beam O
jets O
such O
as O
the O
Airbusse B-MISC

the O
Boeing-767 B-MISC
were O
at O
first O
largely O
closed O

The O
necessary O
detours O
via O
Greenland B-LOC
and O
Newfoundland B-LOC
cost O
additional O
flight O
time O
and O
made O
economic O
flight O
operation O
impossible O
. O

Under O
pressure O
from O
manufacturers O
and O
airlines O
, O
which O
promised O
economic O
benefits O
from O
the O
cost O
- O
effective O
use O
of O
two O
- O
beams O
on O
long O

Such O

An O

about O
this O

by O
Belgian O
sculptor O
Constantin B-PER
Meunier I-PER
( O

) O
reads O
as O
follows O
: O

" O
What O
does O
he O
actually O
introduce O
? O

The O
right O

of O

What O
else O
? O

The O

" O
( O

, O
as O
the O
figure O
created O
in O
1883 O
is O
called O
, O
stands O
with O
both O
legs O
in O
a O
crisis O
of O
art O
, O
to O
whose O
authenticity O
and O
social O
claim O
artists O
such O
as O
Meunier B-PER
or O
his O
far O
more O
famous O
companion O
van B-PER
Gogh I-PER
have O
wrestled O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
19th O
century O
. O

The O
snugs O
of O
Art O

, O
the O
rigid O
ideals O
of O
neo O
- O
classicism O
and O
the O
bohemian O
salon O
life O
seemed O
inappropriate O
to O
human O
reality O
that O
they O
experienced O
to O
the O
point O
of O
lying O
. O

Meunier B-PER
's I-PER
answer O
to O
this O
was O
the O
radical O
turning O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
, O
to O
model O
workers O
- O
figures O
. O

He O
was O
not O
concerned O
with O
the O
depiction O
of O
the O
misery O
in O
which O
the O
proletariat O
had O
fallen O
through O
the O
industrialization O
that O
was O
not O
yet O
socially O
acceptable O
at O
the O
time O
. O

He O
created O
realistic O

that O
embody O
with O
a O
certain O
pathos O
unbroken O
force O

pride O
and O
dignity O

clearly O

was O
in O
a O

Our O

many O

no O

so O
cloudy O
and O
there O
was O
no O
more O

It O
is O
said O
that O
with O
the O
sewage O
treatment O
plant O
is O
only O
a O
rumor O
, O
and O
the O
waste O
water O
is O
now O
only O
directed O
to O
the O
neighboring O
bay O
, O
where O
the O
fishing O
village O

We O
're O
not O

anyway O
, O
the O
fish O

tastes O
fader O
, O
and O
the O
waiters O
were O
getting O
more O
unfriendly O
and O
once O
even O
properly O
failed O
, O
when O
Heinz B-PER
got O
tasteful O
of O
goat O
meat O
and O
even O
wanted O
to O
pay O
accordingly O
. O

This O
time O
we O
have O
often O
been O
in O
" O
La B-LOC
Matalla I-LOC
" O
, O
the O
northern O
tip O
of O
our O
bay O
, O
which O
they O
have O
only O
now O
built O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
sweet O
, O
small O
bungalow O
village O
with O
diving O
school O
, O
disco O
, O
two O
restaurants O
and O
a O

Earlier O
there O
were O
some O
hideous O
barracks O
, O
which O
have O
blown O
them O
away O
along O
with O
a O
forest O
and O
some O
rocks O
that O
were O
in O
the O
way O
and O
then O
all O
the O
rubble O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
San B-LOC
Felipiano I-LOC
into O
the O
sea O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
also O
these O
annoying O
, O
ugly O
seabirds O
have O
disappeared O
, O
which O
used O
to O
nest O
there O
. O

Allegedly O
they O
are O
said O
to O
be O
very O
rare O
, O
but O
last O
year O
there O
were O
still O
enough O
of O
it O
to O
bring O
me O
with O
their O
screeching O
three O
nights O
in O
a O
row O
to O
sleep O
. O

Luckily O
they O
have O
fenced O
the O
whole O
bay O
around O
the O
" O
Plaja B-LOC
Paraiso I-LOC
" O
so O
that O
now O
this O
whole O
household O
no O
longer O
comes O
to O
the O
beach O
to O
sell O
or O
steal O
any O
stuff O
. O

It O
has O
become O
more O
and O
more O
, O
as O
it O
is O
said O
, O
because O
unemployment O
in O
the O
region O
is O
said O
to O
be O
over O
40 O
percent O
. O

So O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
. O

There O
is O
truly O
enough O
to O
do O
in O
our O
holiday O
bay O
, O
especially O
for O
people O
who O
are O
not O
too O
fine O
to O
learn O

few O

Although O
the O
security O

is O
already O
quite O
large O
, O
I O
have O
read O
that O
they O
are O
still O
looking O
for O
people O

Also O
with O
the O
faster O
removal O
of O
the O
cans O
and O

, O
which O
lie O
around O
in O
many O
places O
, O
one O
could O
employ O
some O
willing O
to O
work O
. O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
believe O
how O
speechless O
most O
locals O
are O
here O
! O

With O
the O
type O
that O
used O
to O
run O

bowling O

, O
the O
understanding O
was O
so O
difficult O
that O
we O
had O
no O
desire O
to O
go O
there O
at O
all O
at O
the O
end O
. O

No O

the O
guy O
broke O

A O
found O

bought O
the O

as O

quite O
cheaply O

now O

back O

the O
Middle O

it O
is O

mentioned O

In O
1348 O
Johann B-PER
von I-PER
Goldstein I-PER
took O
over O
the O
estate O
, O
which O
henceforth O
bore O
his O
name O
. O

Johann B-PER
did O
not O
care O
very O
much O
about O
the O
building O
regulations O
of O
the O
Emperor O
Ludwig B-PER
: O

He O
wrote O
that O
within O

five O

zone O
around O
the O
city O
no O
castle O
- O
like O

could O

But O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
Johann B-PER

did O
. O

He O
moved O
walls O
around O
his O
new O

filled O
a O
fortification O
ditch O
with O
water O
that O
he O
diverted O
from O
the O
nearby O
Schwarzbach B-LOC

built O
a O
drawbridge O
along O
with O

. O

In O
brief O
: O

From O
the O
humble O
estate O
became O
a O
water O
castle O
that O
was O
to O
withstand O
a O
conquest O
. O

The O
Council O
of O
the O
City O
of O
Frankfurt B-LOC
was O
anything O

enthusiastic O
about O
the O
completed O
facts O
. O

The O
zealous O
castle O
builder O
nevertheless O
got O
away O
with O
it O
. O

Although O
the O
city O
fathers O
had O
the O
right O
to O
tear O
down O
the O
castle O
, O
they O
let O
Johann B-PER
von I-PER
Goldstein I-PER
grant O
it O
. O

After O
the O
death O
of O
the O
lord O
of O
the O
castle O
, O
the O
town O
acquired O
the O
estate O
for O
800 O

around O
1400 O

About O
150 O
years O
later O
, O
Margrave O
Achilles B-PER

burned O
down O

: O

In O
the O

of O

in O
retreat O
in O
the O
Schmalkaldic B-MISC

after O

In O
his O
anger O
he O
let O

which O
from O
then O
on O
was O
broken O
. O

In O
the O

The O
two O

called O

in O

Fureti√®re B-PER

charming O

witty O
his O
narrative O

his O
literary O
expectations O

are O
actually O
two O
different O

finally O
one O
realizes O
that O
this O

had O
to O
stand O
a O
little O
behind O
next O
to O
the O
novel O
Comique O
of O

This O

because O

the O

Next O

up O

that O

it O

Today O
this O

no O

According O
to O
data O
provided O
by O
Toyota B-ORG
, O
what O
was O
true O
for O
the O
first O
attempts O
at O
walking O
this O

concept O
- O

no O

The O
latest O

not O

meets O
the O
strict O

which O
still O
covers O

also O

and O
that O
over O
a O

of O
80 O

Thus O
, O
for O
the O
ecologically O
responsible O
car O
buyer O
in O
Europe B-LOC
a O
new O
offer O
arises O
, O
because O
still O
the O
simple O
rule O
is O
that O
every O
non O
- O
burned O
liter O
of O

is O
the O
best O
contribution O
to O
environmental O
protection O
. O

With O
this O
Toyota B-MISC
concept I-MISC
for O
gasoline O
engines O
, O
the O
modern O
diesel O
engine O
will O
undoubtedly O
be O
given O
a O
new O
competitive O
edge O
, O
as O
its O
previous O
consumption O
advantage O
will O
shrink O
to O
almost O
zero O
in O
the O
usual O
everyday O
traffic O
. O

This O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
will O
certainly O
spur O
diesel O
engineers O
to O
make O
new O
efforts O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Toyota B-MISC
engineers I-MISC
must O
be O
certified O
: O

As O
consistent O
as O

According O

the O

In O
addition O

the O

And O
again O
it O

From O
the O

that O

from O

In O
1715 O
he O
was O
elected O

Three O

In O

, O
Lersner B-PER
took O
over O
the O
post O
of O

But O
besides O
all O

In O

, O
who O

a O
little O

tried O

the O

stick O
to O
its O
diversity O
: O

In O
the O

three O

the O

the O
conflict O
of O
cultures O
: O

The O
old O
, O
traditional O
culture O
shapes O
India B-LOC
as O
well O
as O
the O
new O
, O
western O
. O

It O
became O
more O
illustrative O
, O
when O
Heidemarie B-PER
Pandey I-PER
read O
from O
the O
modern O
Indian B-MISC
women O
's O
novel O
" O
Anaro B-MISC
" O
by O
Marijul B-PER
Bhagat I-PER
, O
which O
the O
Pandey B-PER
couple O
translated O
from O
Indian B-MISC
into O
German B-MISC
. O

Here O
the O
focus O
was O
on O
Indian B-MISC
everyday O
life O
: O

Anaro B-PER
, O
the O
heroine O
of O
the O
novel O
, O
works O
as O
a O
maid O
, O
lives O
in O
the O
slums O
and O
has O
to O
care O
for O
her O
little O
daughter O
, O
which O
the O
father O
does O
not O
care O
about O
. O

But O
the O
insight O
into O
Indian B-MISC
everyday O
life O
remained O
short O
and O
a O
little O
superficial O
- O

because O
the O
audience O

lacked O

Thus O
, O
from O

by O

Peter B-PER
Neuhaus I-PER
for O
three O

which O

a O

While O

an O

this O
takes O

" O

the O

So O
far O
, O
the O
researchers O
have O
tested O
the O
apparatus O
only O
in O
animal O
experiments O
. O

Later O
the O
device O
should O
stand O
next O

the O

and O
be O
connected O
to O
the O
human O
bloodstream O
via O

The O
blood O
flows O
through O
a O
replaceable O
component O
that O
consists O
of O
a O
mesh O
of O
fine O
plastic O
tubes O
. O

The O
pig O
liver O
cells O
adhere O
to O
the O
tubes O
. O

They O
filter O
out O
of O
the O
blood O
pollutants O
that O
are O
either O
fed O
from O
the O
outside O
or O
arise O
during O
metabolism O
in O
the O
body O
. O

These O
include O
, O
for O
example O
, O
phenols O
and O
ammonia O
. O

Both O
substances O
lead O
to O
brain O
damage O
. O

The O
component O
works O
on O
average O
for O
a O
week O
. O

Then O
it O
must O
be O
exchanged O
for O
a O
new O
one O
with O
fresh O
pig O

. O

The O
researchers O
have O
had O
great O
difficulty O
to O
grow O
enough O
cells O
so O
far O
. O

According O
to O
Gerlach B-PER
, O
this O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
Berlin O

doctors O
had O
succeeded O
. O

At O
least O
60 O
percent O

the O
cells O
of O
a O
pig O
liver O
should O
be O
isolated O

This O

its O

His O

not O

but O
arises O
as O
a O

according O
to O
the O

In O
order O
to O
avoid O
any O

, O
the O
model O
shipper O
has O
now O
travelled O
to O
Hamburg B-LOC
to O
take O

and O
study O
the O

of O

" O
admits O
Chairman O
Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
unreservedly O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Hanau B-MISC
modelmakers O
attach O
great O
importance O
to O
a O
fine O
difference O
: O

In O
no O
case O
do O
they O
want O
to O
apply O
to O
pursue O
their O
leisure O
activities O
with O
obstinateness O
. O

That O
would O
hardly O
be O
the O
right O
word O
to O
characterize O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
hobbyists O
and O
inventors O
. O

If O
the O
men O
( O
whose O
domain O
of O
modeling O
is O
still O
) O
enthusiastically O
tell O
of O
technical O
details O
, O
proudly O
demonstrate O
their O
little O
marvels O
or O
follow O
with O
remote O
control O
in O
the O
hand O
banished O
the O
tracks O
of O
a O

, O
this O
has O
rather O
something O
amiably O
quirky O
. O

As O
" O
individualists O
who O
have O
come O
together O
about O
the O
common O
love O
of O

" O
, O
Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
describes O
the O

to O
the O
a O
total O
of O
about O
100 O

. O

They O
are O

for O

by O

according O
to O
the O
individuality O
claim O
in O
the O
form O
of O
" O
small O

" O
during O

. O

Two O
" O
groups O
" O
have O
emerged O
in O
the O

which O
has O
existed O
since O

: O

the O

themselves O
in O
this O
way O
in O
the O

a O

For O

Joseph B-PER

wants O

With O

however O
, O

Unlike O
the O

the O

not O

. O
" O

In O
the O

would O
otherwise O

too O
bad O

" O
, O
explains O
Pongratz B-PER
. O

Flying O
is O
a O
chapter O
in O
itself O
anyway O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
not O

The O
story O
of O
the O

Josefine B-PER

who O
only O

discovers O
her O

a O

life O

, O
Alla B-PER

very O
important O

" O
Women O

emancipated O

far O
as O
the O

from O
mid-30s O
onwards O
they O
think O
that O
life O
is O
already O
over O
for O
them O
, O
" O
said O
the O
translator O
, O
adding O
: O

" O
Perhaps O
because O
in O
socialist O
society O
the O
life O
of O
the O
individual O
was O
determined O
very O
early O
and O
the O
decision O
that O
was O
made O
was O
then O

The O
story O
" O
When B-MISC
Grandma I-MISC
became I-MISC
Josefine I-MISC
" O
makes O
it O
clear O

however O
, O
that O
man O
is O
never O
too O
old O
to O

is O
not O
only O
a O
special O
Russian B-MISC
problem O
, O
which O
showed O
the O
reactions O
of O
predominantly O
female O
middle O

aged O
listeners O
from O
Spain B-LOC

the O
local O
councillors O
from O
the O
district O
9 O
( O
Dornbusch B-LOC
, O
Eschersheim B-LOC
and O
Ginnheim B-LOC

also O
decided O
to O
do O
so O
. O

According O
to O
the O
Magistrate O
, O
the O
participating O
offices O
are O
currently O
examining O
how O
a O
decision O
taken O
by O
the O
Council O
of O
the O
European B-ORG
Community I-ORG
in O
1989 O
can O
be O
transferred O
to O
the O
city O
of O
Frankfurt B-MISC
. O

The O
smoking O
ban O
in O
public O
waiting O
rooms O
should O
be O
, O
so O
it O
was O
from O
the O
town O
hall B-LOC
, O
only O
a O
first O
step O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
stop O
smoking O
everywhere O
where O
children O
were O

As O
far O
as O
possible O
not O
at O
home O
, O
because O
more O
than O
half O
of O
the O
German B-MISC
children O
lived O
in O
smoking O
households O
. O

According O
to O
the O
Health O
Department O
, O
numerous O
studies O
show O
how O
dangerous O
passive O
smoking O
is O
especially O
for O
children O
: O

Even O
before O
delivery O
, O
this O
reduces O
the O
birth O
weight O
; O
another O
consequence O
is O
premature O
, O
miscarriages O
and O
stillbirths O
. O

Respiratory O
diseases O
are O
about O
twice O
as O
common O
in O
children O
of O
smoking O
parents O
in O
the O
first O
two O
years O
of O
life O
as O
in O
children O
of O
non O

smokers O
. O

According O
to O
estimates O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Health I-ORG
Office I-ORG
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
up O
to O
1200 O
people O
in O
the O
old O
federal O
states O
each O
year O
suffer O
from O
lung O
cancer O
caused O
by O
passive O
smoking O
. O

Josef B-PER
Hartinger I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
is O
convinced O
that O
people O
in O
the O
West O
of O
Frankfurt B-MISC
would O
accept O
a O
smoking O
ban O
in O
waiting O
rooms O
. O
" O

The O
problem O
awareness O
is O
there O
, O
" O
says O
the O
deputy O
local O
head O
and O
passionate O
smoker O
: O

" O
At O
the O
main O
station B-LOC
I O
have O
already O
been O
politely O
admonished O
, O
when O
I O
forgot O
to O
make O
out O
my O
whistle O
. O
" O

Fortunately O
, O
smoking O
among O
young O
people O
and O
students O
decreases O
significantly O
. O

According O
to O
Hartinger O
, O
the O
CDU B-MISC
Group I-MISC
also O
wants O
to O
support O
a O
request O
that O
the O
SPD B-ORG
will O
submit O
to O
the O
local O
council O
meeting O
next O
Tuesday O
. O

Thereafter O
, O
in O
the O
western O
districts O
, O
it O
is O
intended O
to O
be O
prohibited O

The O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
made O
an O
important O
contribution O
to O
the O
consideration O
of O
the O
interests O
of O
people O
and O
the O
environment O
by O
developing O
principles O
for O
the O
relocation O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
displaced O
persons O
or O
other O
affected O
persons O
and O
the O
environmental O
impact O
of O
such O
projects O
for O
projects O
financed B-MISC
by O
the O
World O
Bank O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
Government O
of B-LOC
India I-LOC
has O
developed O
a O
comprehensive O
system O
to O
reduce O
environmental O
damage O
from O
public O
projects O
. O

Despite O
all O
these O
positive O
factors O
, O
however O
, O
we O
fear O
that O
the O
situation O
is O
very O
serious O
. O

We O
have O
discovered O
serious O
errors O
in O
the O
implementation O
of O
the O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC

We O
think O
that O
the O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC
, O
as O
they O
are O
planned O
and O
implemented O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
are O
flawed O
, O
that O
relocation O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
all O
those O
who O
have O
to O
be O
forced O
to O
relocate O
through O
the O
project O
is O
not O
possible O
under O
the O
given O
circumstances O
and O
that O
the O
environmental O
effects O
of O
the O
project O
are O
not O
carefully O
considered O
or O
adequately O
taken O
into O
account O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
is O
just O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
situation O
that O
has O
arisen O
as O
the O
debtor O
. O

The O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
intended O
to O
bring O
drinking O
water O
to O
Kutch B-LOC

other O
drought O

areas O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC

to O
irrigate O
a O
large O
area O
of O
this O
state O
as O
well O
as O
two O
districts O
in O
Rajasthan B-LOC
. O

This O
requires O
a O
large O
reservoir O
on O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
river I-LOC
and O
an O
extensive O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
. O

The O
Sardar O

Sarovar B-LOC
dam I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
currently O
being O
built O
on O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
river I-LOC
at O
Navagam B-LOC
and O
Kevadia B-LOC
, O
will O
build O
up O
water O
to O
a O
full O
reservoir O
height O
of O
455 O
feet O
( O
about O
151 O
meters O
, O
that O
is O
) O
. O

It O
will O
put O
37 O
000 O
hectares O
of O
land O
under O
water O
in O
the O
three O
states O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC

Madhya B-LOC

The O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-LOC
dam I-LOC
, O
together O
with O
the O
planned O
projects O
, O
is O
further O
upstream O
designed O
so O
that O
it O
distributes O
9.5 O
million O
acre O
feet O
of O
water O
from O
the O
river O
Narmada B-LOC
into O
a O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
. O

The O
channel O
itself O
is O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
its O
capacity O
, O
the O
largest O
in O
the O
world O
and O
will O
extend O
over O
a O
length O
of O
450 O
kilometers O
to O
the O

of B-LOC
Rajasthan I-LOC

The O
main O

initially O
250 O
meters O
wide O
, O
towards O
the O
end O
, O
at O
the O
border O
with O
Rajasthan B-LOC
, O
the O

is O
still O
100 O
meters O
. O

The O
distribution O

has O
a O
total O
length O
of O
75,000 O
kilometres O
. O

A O
total O
of O
about O
80 O
000 O
hectares O
of O
land O
is O
needed O
for O
this O
, O
more O
than O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
the O
area O
that O

The O
Sardar O

Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
water O

projects O
ever O
undertaken O
, O
their O
impact O
covering O
a O
vast O
area O
and O
affecting O
a O
large O
number O
of O
people O
, O
in O
particular O
tribal O
members O
. O

At O
least O
100 O
000 O
people O
in O
245 O
villages O
live O
in O
the O
area O
that O
will O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
flood O
. O

In O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
are O
almost O
all O
affected O
tribal O
members O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
live O
" O
illegal O
" O
there O
, O
i.e. O
they O
have O
no O
legal O
title O
for O
their O
country O
. O

Also O
in O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
live O
in O
the O
flood O
area O
thousands O
of O
tribal O
members O
, O
of O
which O
also O
many O
have O
no O
land O
titles O
. O

In O
Madhya B-LOC

there O
are O
also O
many O
villages O
with O
Hindus O
in O
which O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
conventional O
agriculture O
pursue O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
100,000 O
people O
living O
in O
the O
flood O
region O
, O
there O
are O
probably O
about O
140 O
000 O
farmers O
affected O
by O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
. O

And O
finally O
, O
there O
are O
several O
thousand O
more O
people O
who O
live O
downstream O
, O
below O
the O
dam O
, O
and O
whose O
lives O
will O
also O
be O
significantly O
changed O
. O

In O
1985 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
entered O
into O
loan O
and O
bond O
negotiations O
with O
the O
Government O
of O
India B-LOC
and O
the O
Governments O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
Madhya B-LOC

and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
for O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
Damme O
and O

Within O
these O
treaties O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
treated O
only O
the O
people O
as O
" O
project O

affected O
" O
- O
with O
the O
right O
to O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
- O
whose O
villages O
are O
flooded O
. O

So O
our O
first O
task O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
measures O
taken O
to O
resettle O
and O
rehabilitate O
these O
people O
. O

The O
overall O
task O
for O
our O
investigation O
refers O
to O
persons O
who O
are O
" O
displaced O
by O
the O
reservoir O
and O
the O
infrastructure O
" O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
were O
asked O
by O
President O
Conable B-PER
to O
include O
in O
our O
investigation O
also O
considerations O
on O
the O
status O
of O

for O

The O
idea O
of O
containment O
of O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
goes O
back O
many O
years O
, O
but O
a O
realization O
was O
made O
more O
difficult O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
river O
passes O
through O
three O
states O
, O
which O
could O
not O
agree O
on O
a O
division O
of O
project O
costs O
and O
benefits O
. O

In O
1969 O
, O
the O
dispute O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
Narmada B-MISC
Water I-MISC
Court I-MISC
, O
which O
was O
established O
under O
the O
Interstate B-MISC

Act I-MISC

In O
1979 O
it O
announced O
its O
award O
. O

The O
arbitral O
tribunal O
, O
as O
the O
states O
had O
agreed O
, O
went O
out O
of O
28 O
million O
acre O
feet O
of O
water O
as O
the O
river O
of O
Narmada B-LOC
, O
which O
should O
be O
distributed O
. O

It O
alluded O
to O
nine O
million O
acre O
feet O
water O
Gujarat B-LOC
- O
the O
water O
should O
be O
channelled O
into O
the O
canal O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
this O
state O
( O
an O
additional O
0.5 O
million O
acre O
feet O
should O
be O
delivered O
to O
Rajasthan B-LOC
) O
. O

The O
hydroelectric O
utility O
was O
divided O
among O
the O
three O
shore O
states O
. O

The O
conditions O
on O
which O
the O
ruling B-PER
of O
the O
Arbitration O

was O
based O
included O
a O
second O

In O
1985 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG

A O
further O
request O
of O
over O
$ O
350 O

was O
made O
for O
the O

And O
at O
the O

It O
must O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
World B-ORG

considered O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
our O

carried O
out O

The O
World B-ORG

has O
provided O
us O
with O
all O
the O
necessary O
documents O

has O
entered O
into O
the O
most O
engaged O

with O
us O

has O
given O
us O
the O
freedom O
of O

that O
we O
needed O
to O
carry O
out O
this O

We O
do O
not O
know O
any O

any O

ever O
established O

with O
such O
a O
comprehensive O

for O
a O

, O
no O
matter O
how O
controversial O
it O
was O
. O

The O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
's O
determination O
to O
do O
this O
is O
evidence O
of O
its O
determination O
to O
understand O
what O
went O
wrong O
with O
the O
projects O
. O

Similarly O
, O
we O
received O
support O
from O
the O
government O
of O

In O
the O
past O
, O
people O
who O
lived O
in O
the O

were O
often O
forced O
to O
settle O
in O
the O
construction O
of O
large O

, O
often O
without O
appropriate O

This O
has O
happened O
in O
both O

developing O
countries O
. O

In O
such O
cases O
, O
compensation O
was O
often O
only O
cash O

and O
this O
money O
was O
very O
often O
not O
sufficient O
, O
rarely O
- O
if O
at O
all O
- O
enough O
to O
buy O

) O

In O
1979 O
, O
the O
Narmada B-MISC

Court I-MISC
in O
India B-LOC
itself O
established O
that O
displaced O

( O
5 O

In O

, O
the O

found O
that O
adult O

should O
be O
treated O
by O

this O

India B-LOC
and O
the O
three O

of O
Gujarat B-LOC

represent O
the O
position O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
ruling O
of O

, O
land O
should O
apply O
only O
to O

i.e. O
possess O
what O

In O
their O
opinion O
it O
was O
not O
the O
intention O
of O

that O

that O

not O

be O
about O

also O
about O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
it O
requires O
that O

at O

regain O
their O
previous O

Indeed O
, O
the O

were O
based O
on O
the O
measures O
laid O
down O
in O
the O
1979 O
arbitration O
award O

However O
, O
this O

sought O
only O
to O
settle O
a O
dispute O
between O

He O
did O
not O

of O
the O

the O

He O
did O
not O
even O

nor O
did O
he O
deal O
with O
the O

, O
nor O
did O
he O
charge O
the O
cultural O
characteristics O
of O
the O
forced O

; O
in O
the O
award O
there O
is O
no O
discussion O
about O

or O
land O
ownership O
without O
land O
title O
or O
about O
the O
true O
meaning O
of O
, O
landlessness O

. O

In O
1985 O
, O
when O
the O
credit O

were O
signed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
basis O
for O
the O
draft O
, O

and O
compensation O
for O
relocation O

The O
number O
of O
people O
who O
would O
be O
affected O
was O
not O
known O
; O
the O
extent O
of O
likely O

had O
never O
been O
considered O
; O
the O

Furthermore O
, O
there O
had O
been O
no O

There O
were O
still O

So O
there O
was O
also O
no O
adequate O
relocation O

with O
the O
result O
that O
human O
costs O
could O
not O
enter O

the O

a O
factor O
. O

Measures O
to O
reduce O
such O
costs O
could O
not O
be O
designed O
in O

with O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
parties O

When O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
signed O
the O
contracts O
for O
the O
Sardar O

Sarovar B-LOC
dam I-LOC
, O
it O
took O

the O
definition O
of O
land O
- O
owners O
, O
i.e. O
those O
who O
did O
not O
include O
farmers O
without O
land O
titles O
, O
as O
laid O
down O
by O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
dealt O
with O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
adult O
sons O
should O
receive O
land O
, O
not O
. O

This O
allowed O
the O
majority O
of O
displaced O
tribal O
members O
to O
be O
deprived O
of O
their O
possessions O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
did O
not O
make O
any O
separate O
provision O
in O
the O
Arrangement O
for O
the O
Channel O
for O
the O
persons O
who O
would O
be O
displaced O
or O
otherwise O
affected O
by O
the O
Channel O
. O

Only O
those O
affected O
by O
flooding O
or O
the O
infrastructure O
of O
the O
project O
were O
defined O
as O
displaced O
persons O
, O
although O
in O
1980 O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
had O
already O
admitted O
that O
relocation O
is O
necessary O
in O
the O
event O
of O
displacement O
by O
sewer O
and O
irrigation O
systems O
. O

In O
1990 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
announced O
comprehensive O
relocation O
principles O
, O
which O
must O
generally O
be O
applied O
to O
forced O
relocations O
, O
and O
in O
1991 O
it O
announced O
special O
relocation O
principles O
for O
tribal O
members O
. O

These O
statements O
repeated O
the O
principles O
established O
a O
decade O
earlier O
and O
further O
differentiated O
them O
. O

These O
principles O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
reflect O
the O
general O
adoption O
of O
new O
human O
rights O
concepts O
. O

They O
recognise O
that O
large O
- O
scale O
projects O
, O
especially O
in O
rural O
, O
forest O
and O
settlement O
areas O
, O
can O
force O
- O
proliferate O
people O
as O
much O
as O
war O
or O
natural O
disasters O
. O

They O
focus O
on O
people O
displaced O
by O
progress O
in O
development O
and O
demand O
that O
the O
human O
rights O
of O
displaced O
persons O
be O
respected O
in O
each O
project O
. O

According O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
, O
these O
are O
rights O
that O
can O
not O
be O
overridden O
by O
national O
sovereignty O
or O
interests O
. O

Such O
considerations O
may O
justify O
a O
project O
, O
but O
according O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
they O
do O
not O
justify O
the O
cancellation O
of O
these O
human O
rights O
by O
a O
project O
. O

The O
governments O
of O
the O
three O

willingness O

is O
, O
however O
, O
disagreement O
about O
interpretation O

Gujarat B-LOC
, O
with O
4700 O
displaced O
families O
, O
adopted O
a O
policy O
in O
1988 O
according O
to O
which O
every O
land O
- O
owner O
is O
offered O
2 O
hectares O
of O
land O

It O
also O
offers O
2 O
hectares O
to O
those O
who O
are O
classified O
as O
" O
landless O
" O
; O
tribal O
members O
and O
others O
who O
may O
work O
land O
without O
land O
title O
, O
thus O
receive O
2 O
hectares O
of O
land O

According O
to O
Gujarat B-LOC
's I-LOC
policy O
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
ruling O
of O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
, O
adult O

also O
receive O
two O
hectares O
. O

The O
Government O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
the O
Governments O
of O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
agree O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
's I-LOC
policy O
goes O
beyond O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
and O
the O
World B-MISC

Maharashtra B-LOC

where O
about O
3000 O

, O
and O
Madhya B-LOC

, O
with O
23 O

to O
be O
relocated O
, O
are O
willing O
to O
allocate O
two O
hectares O
of O
land O
to O
land O

owners O

But O
they O
are O
not O
willing O
to O
give O
two O
hectares O
for O
adult O
sons O
. O

Neither O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
nor O
Maharashtra B-LOC
recognizes O
any O
rights O
for O
land O
compensation O
to O
people O
without O
land O

. O

These O
differences O
in O
national O
policies O
led O
to O
a O
dispute O
over O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
award O
and O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
's O
credit O
contracts O
. O

The O
dispute O
may O
seem O
technical O
, O
but O
its O
outcome O
depends O
on O
the O
opportunities O
for O
thousands O
of O
forced O
displaced O

The O

of O
the O
World B-ORG

referred O
to O

to O

by O

their O
favour O
, O
which O
they O
had O
prior O
to O

( O
Emphasis O
by O
authors O

How O
can O
this O
be O
ensured O
in O
the O
case O
of O
displaced O
persons O
who O
know O
only O
agriculture O
as O
employment O
and O
in O
which O
it O
represents O
the O
heart O
of O
their O
social O
, O
economic O
and O
cultural O
life O
, O
if O
not O
by O
providing O
them O
with O
land O
for O
processing O
during O
relocation O
? O

In O
1984 O

the O
Narmada B-LOC
Control O
Authority O

which O
had O

set O
up O

" O
For O
tribal O
members O
there O
is O
no O
more O
effective O
rehabilitation O
than O
to O
provide O
land O
for O

. O
" O

We O
have O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
the O
only O
way O
to O
ensure O
that O
their O
standard O
of O
living O
improves O
or O
remains O
the O
same O
. O

The O
result O
, O
when O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
are O
called O
landless O
, O
means O
that O
people O
who O
work O
the O
land O
they O
consider O
to O
be O
their O
own O
, O
become O
landless O
workers O
. O

This O
is O
not O
rehabilitation O
. O

It O
does O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
live O
at O
least O
as O
well O
as O
before O
. O

The O
tribal O
members O
of O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
are O
very O
conscious O
of O
this O
and O
what O
it O
means O
for O
them O
when O
they O
are O
relocated O
as O
landless O
agricultural O
workers O
. O

When O
we O
visited O
Bamni B-LOC
, O
a O
tribal O
village O
in O
Maharashtra B-LOC
, O
people O
told O
us O
: O

" O
We O
are O
peasants O
, O
not O
workers O
. O
" O

In O
our O
view O
, O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
have O
not O
met O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
's O
credit O
conditions O
, O
as O
they O
have O
not O
managed O
to O
provide O
adequate O
land O
for O
the O
rehabilitation O
of O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
. O

The O
states O
argue O
that O
, O
after O
the O
award O
and O
the O
agreements O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
all O
displaced O
persons O
have O
the O
right O
to O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
where O
both O
landowners O
and O
landless O
displaced O
persons O
are O
to O
receive O
two O
hectares O
of O
irrigated O
land O
. O

Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
therefore O
expect O
that O
many O
displaced O
people O
will O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
. O

Accordingly O
, O
the O
resettlement O
plan O
of O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
actually O
contains O
only O
10 O
% O
of O
the O
land O
needed O
for O
resettlement O
. O

But O
many O
displaced O
people O
do O
not O
want O
to O
move O
to O
Gujarat B-LOC
for O
reasons O
related O
to O
language O
, O
culture O
and O
other O
ties O
to O
the O
region O
. O

For O
many O
of O
them O
, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
major O
cultural O
change O

Both O
according O
to O
the O
ruling O
of O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
and O
according O
to O
the O
contracts O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
displaced O
persons O
have O
the O
right O
to O
be O
resettled O
in O
their O
own O
state O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
been O
quite O
successful O
in O
the O
implementation O
of O
resettlements O
in O
the O
last O
eighteen O
months O
, O
but O
so O
far O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
only O
settled O
about O
3000 O
families O
. O

Resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
so O
much O
more O
displaced O
people O
- O
perhaps O
15,000 O
families O
- O
from O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
, O
would O
be O
an O
enormous O
task O
for O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
would O
nevertheless O
significantly O
burden O
its O
limited O
resources O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
is O
not O
only O
about O
relocation O
, O
it O
is O
also O
about O
rehabilitating O
the O
people O
. O

The O
states O
may O
be O
able O
to O
organize O
the O
physical O
move O
of O
thousands O
of O
families O
to O
land O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
will O
be O
able O
to O
rehabilitate O
them O
all O
. O

( O

The O
only O
relocation O
policy O
that O
all O
three O

must O
apply O
is O
that O
of O
the O
World B-ORG

But O
this O
policy O
of O
the O
World B-ORG

has O
not O
been O
followed O

The O

were O

you O
have O
paid O
some O

in O
the O
form O

But O
since O
1985 O
these O
people O
have O
also O
been O
covered O
by O
the O
contracts O
with O
the O
World B-ORG

Their O
right O
to O
land O
should O
have O
been O
recognised O
seven O
years O
ago O
, O
but O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
failed O
to O
ensure O
recognition O
of O
these O
rights O
by O
Gujarat B-LOC
as O
part O
of O
the O
treaties O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
provision O
of O
adequate O
land O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
recently O
urged O
India B-LOC
, O
but O
without O
insisting O
on O
it O
, O
that O
India B-LOC
and O
the O
states O
should O
comply O
with O
the O
1979 O
arbitral O
ruling O
on O
adult O

; O
India B-LOC
should O
establish O
principles O
to O
meet O
the O
comprehensive O

of O
the O
World B-MISC

and O
ensure O

However O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
not O
only O
failed O
to O
bring O
the O

and O
the O

into O
force O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
channel O
, O
it O
has O
failed O
in O
so O
far O
as O
it O
has O
not O
laid O
down O
binding O
rules O
in O
its O

which O
requires O

What O
about O
the O
villagers O
who O

in O
the O

of O
the O

? O

The O
construction O
of O
the O

will O
affect O
140 O

of O

perhaps O
13 O

no O
one O
knows O

To O
the O

The O
number O
of O

affected O
is O
controversial O
in O

so O
much O
is O
clear O
: O

Takeover O
of O
land O
under O
the O

has O
often O

that O

below O
the O
real O

us O

the O

is O
clearly O
the O

of O
the O

The O
history O

impact O
of O
Sardar B-LOC

Sarovar I-LOC
is O
a O
history O
of O
non O

granted O

. O

There O
is O
no O
comprehensive O
document O
on O
the O
impact O
. O

The O
nature O
and O
extent O
of O
environmental O
problems O
and O
solutions O
are O
unknown O
. O

This O
contributes O
significantly O
to O
the O
controversy O
surrounding O
the O
project O
. O

As O
with O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
, O
this O
fact O
has O
put O
our O
investigation O
into O
a O
difficult O
situation O
. O

In O
order O
to O
finish O
our O
work O
, O
we O
had O
to O
collect O
basic O
ecological O
information O
to O
describe O
the O
likely O
impact O
of O
the O
project O
upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
catchment O
area O
of O
the O
project O
. O

This O
work O
should O
have O
been O
done O
by O
others O
before O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
projects O
. O

( O
.. O

. O

) O

We O
found O
inconsistencies O
in O
the O
basic O
hydrological O
information O
related O
to O
this O
work O
( O
i.e. O
at O
dam O
and O
canal O
, O
i.e. O
) O
. O
Therefore O
, O
we O
analysed O
the O
water O
flow O
data O
and O
made O
our O
own O
analysis O
. O

We O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
there O
is O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
projects O
will O
not O
work O
as O
planned O
. O

The O
problems O
relate O
to O
the O
frequency O
and O
time O
of O
the O
stationary O
currents O
as O
well O
as O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O
dam O
and O
the O
canal O
to O
store O
and O
distribute O
water O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
Sardar B-LOC
Sarovar I-LOC
, O
upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
catchment O
area O
will O
therefore O
be O
different O
from O
those O
currently O
assumed O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
the O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
built O
upstream O
as O
planned O

A O
realistic O
operational O
analysis O
on O
which O
an O
environmental O
sustainability O
assessment O
could O
be O
based O
is O
missing O
. O

This O
has O
alerted O
us O
and O
it O
should O
also O
alert O
others O
, O
especially O
in O
a O
mega O
project O
with O
as O

implications O

The O
deficiencies O
that O
we O
identified O
in O
the O

of O
damage O
in O
the O

field O
also O
extend O
to O
the O
catchment O
area O
of O
the O
project O
. O

Although O
extensive O
studies O
are O
missing O
, O
we O
found O
that O
there O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
problems O
with O
dulling O

salinization O
. O

Pre O

calculations O

on O
the O
plans O
for O
the O

system O
as O

as O
protective O
measures O
are O
questionable O

We O
can O
only O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
future O
problems O
in O
the O
catchment O
area O
as O
a O
whole O
will O
be O
very O
similar O
to O
those O

by O

it O

not O
until O

that O
we O
found O
statements O
by O
the O
World B-MISC

carried O
out O

describes O
various O

that O

spent O

No O

But O
we O
warn O
against O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
can O

We O
have O
come O

the O
conclusion O

draw O
up O
a O
number O
of O

of O
the O
errors O
that O
the O
project O
is O
so O
obvious O

Therefore O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
wisest O
decision O
for O
the O
World B-ORG

would O
be O
to O
withdraw O

Heino B-PER
Kirchhof I-PER

Lohfelden B-LOC
( O

has O

a O

with O
an O
output O
of O
six O
kilowatts O

its O
own O

With O

, O
which O
converts O
irradiated O

even O

electricity O
- O
share B-ORG
company I-ORG
Central I-ORG
Germany I-ORG
( O
EAM B-ORG

. O

Its O
photovoltaic O
system O
produces O
direct O
current O
, O
which O
is O
initially O
converted O
into O
alternating O
current O
via O
a O
so O
- O
called O
inverter O
and O
then O
fed O
into O
the O
grid O
. O

In O
the O
first O
three O
weeks O
, O
the O
average O
electricity O
production O
per O
day O
was O
15 O
kilowatt O
hours O

The O
top O

one O
day O
, O
says O
Kirchhof B-PER
proudly O
, O
were O
21 O
kWh O
. O

This O
is O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
the O
family O
consumes O
on O
average O
per O
day O
. O

What O
remains O
, O
goes O
into O
the O
public O
network O
: O

Each O
kilowatt O
hour O
, O
which O
Kirchhoff B-PER
feeds O
, O
he O
receives O
from O
the O
EAM B-ORG
16,61 O
Pfennig O
. O

However O
, O
the O
EAM B-ORG
collects O
about O
one O
and O
a O
half O
times O
as O
much O
( O
25 O
Pfennig O

, O
if O
Kirchhof O
's O
own O
production O
is O
not O
enough O
and O
he O
has O
to O
tap O
the O
public O

He O
does O
n't O
get O
rich O
by O
trading O
with O
the O
EAM B-ORG
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
to O
him O
either O
: O

Because O
already O
ten O
years O
ago O
the O
family O
set O
itself O
the O
goal O
to O
meet O
its O
energy O
demand O
with O
environmentally O
friendly O
regenerative O
raw O
materials O
. O

It O
all O
started O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
Heino B-PER
Kirchhof I-PER
recognized O
his O
ecological O
" O
sins O
" O
: O

During O
the O
construction O
of O
his O
house O
he O
had O
installed O
about O
an O
electric O
underfloor O
heating O
. O
" O

Electricity O
" O
, O
that O
became O
clear O
to O
him O
only O
in O
hindsight O
, O
" O
is O
far O
too O
precious O
to O
heat O
with O
. O
" O

Thus O
, O
in O
1982 O
he O
exchanged O
the O
underfloor O
heating O
for O
four O
tiled O
stoves O
, O
which O
are O
fed O
with O
dry O
beech O
wood O
" O
. O
" O

Not O
so O
comfortable O
, O
" O
he O
admits O
, O
" O
but O
more O
ecologically O
valuable O
. O
" O

Around O
three O
years O
later O
, O
the O
Kirchhofs B-PER
installed O
solar O
panels O
that O
heat O
the O
water O
for O
showering O
, O
washing O
and O
rinsing O
. O

Such O
solar O
systems O
for O
domestic O
water O
heating O
are O
relatively O
cheaper O
than O
those O
with O
photovoltaics O
, O
comparing O
the O
price O
and O
the O
ecological O
benefits O
: O

" O
With O
10 O
000 O
Marks O
" O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER
anticipates O
, O
" O
a O
photovoltaic O
plant O
can O
be O
financed O
with O
half O
a O
kilowatt O
, O
which O
saves O
about O
0.5 O
tons O
of O
carbon O
dioxide O
. O
" O

With O
the O
same O
amount O
, O
however O
, O
a O
complete O
domestic O
water O
heating O
system O
could O
also O
be O
paid O
. O

And O
the O
save O
considerably O
more O
carbon O
dioxide O
one O
. O

Therefore O
, O
solar O
thermal O
energy O
is O
primarily O
promoted O
in O
Hesse B-LOC
. O

According O
to O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of O
the O
Environment O
, O
the O
country O
grants O
up O
to O
3000 O
marks O
for O
such O
solar O
installations O
, O
but O
not O
more O
than O
30 O
percent O
of O
the O
costs O
. O

However O
, O
this O
support O
programme O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O

The O
Kirchhofs O
paid O

for O

That O

why O

to O
build O
a O
small O

This O

A O

added O

A O
costly O
commitment O
to O

For O
Kirchhoff B-PER
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
also O
financially O
viable O
because O
it O

In O
addition O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER

from O
the O
EAM B-ORG

Although O

have O
become O
cheaper O
by O
the O

and O
perhaps O

However O
, O
the O

did O
not O
provide O
for O
a O
real O
breakthrough O
in O

, O
because O
the O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER
considers O

About O

That O

The O

The O

From O
our O
side O
, O
nothing O
stands O
in O
the O
way O
of O
a O
sale O
, O
the O
path O
is O
clear O

, O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
Supervisory O

. O

However O
, O
the O
formal O
sales O
decision O
could O
not O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
Supervisory O
Board O
of O
the O
" O

under O
the O

Hessian B-MISC
Housing O
Minister O
J√∂rg B-PER
Jordan I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
at O
the O
last O
meeting O
. O

The O
reason O
: O

Some O
of O
the O
conditions O
that O
the O
minister O
had O
placed O
on O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
settlement O
are O
not O
yet O
met O
. O

The O
highest O
hurdle O
: O

In O
the O
event O
of O
a O
vote O
, O
two O
thirds O
of O
the O
tenants O
must O
agree O
to O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
to O
the O
cooperative O
. O

Whether O
this O
result O
can O
be O
achieved O
is O
completely O
open O
. O

In O
November O
the O
tenants O
are O
supposed O
to O
decide O
in O
secret O
vote O
on O
the O
further O
fate O
of O
the O
houses O
. O

Should O
this O
vote O
be O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
, O
the O
Supervisory O
Board O
of O
the O
Nassauische B-ORG
Heimst√§tte I-ORG
will O
be O
able O
to O
give O
its O
final O
approval O
to O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
settlement O
at O
the O
next O
meeting O
on O
30 O
November O
. O

This O
would O
end O
a O
seven O
- O
year O
political O
tug O
- O
of O
- O
war O
for O
the O
settlement O
from O
the O
1920s O
. O

( O
For O
backgrounds O
, O

. O
) O

The O
other O
conditions O
of O
the O
Minister O
of O
Housing O
can O
be O
more O
easily O
met O
by O
the O
cooperative O
: O

It O
must O
join O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Treaty I-MISC
" O
. O

It O
provides O
that O
all O
vacant O
dwellings O
must O
be O
notified O
to O
the O
Housing B-ORG
Office I-ORG
and O
that O
new O
tenants O
may O
be O
assigned O
by O
the O
Authority O
. O

This O
condition O
is O
easy O
to O
meet O
, O
said O
the O
board O
member O
of O
the O
cooperative O
, O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
. O

Another O
condition O
of O
the O
Minister O
is O
to O
raise O
the O
rental O
price O
piece O
by O
piece O
up O
to O
a O
square O
meter O
price O
of O
8.50 O
marks O
. O

The O
aim O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
cooperative O
can O
work O
profitably O
and O
that O
the O
country O
does O
not O
have O
to O
face O
a O
bankruptcy O
for O
the O
accumulated O
debts O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
according O
to O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
, O
the O
cooperative O
also O
lacks O
a O
so O
- O
called O
" O
maintenance O
report O
" O

In O
principle O
, O
it O
is O
intended O
to O
clarify O
whether O
a O
small O
cooperative O
can O
manage O
the O
stock O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
of O
only O
1072 O
dwellings O
at O
all O
profitably O
. O

Should O
all O
conditions O
be O
met O
, O
the O
home O
settlement O
may O
change O
owner O
for O
the O
purchase O
price O
of O
about O
80 O
million O
marks O
. O

The O
sum O
shall O
be O
as O
follows O
: O

48.3 O
million O
mark O
is O
given O
by O
the O
country O
of O
the O
cooperative O
as O
an O
interest O
- O
free O
grant O
. O

This O
sum O
was O
received O
in O
1986 O
by O
the O
Nassauische B-ORG
Heimst√§tte I-ORG
for O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
from O
the O
bankruptcy O
estate O
of O
the O
New O
Homeland O
. O

So O
the O
money O
is O
simply O
" O
passed O
on O
" O
. O

The O
missing O
sum O
of O
about O
32 O
million O
marks O
is O
currently O
covered O
by O
mortgages O
, O
which O
should O
also O
be O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
new O
cooperative O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
rent O
increase O
serves O
to O
gradually O
replace O
the O
primary O
school O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
to O
repay O
the O
national O
subsidy O
. O

The O
tenant O
cooperative O
currently O
has O
about O
350 O
members O
. O

It O
promises O
itself O
of O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
above O
all O
a O
" O
tenancy O
close O
administration O
" O
, O
as O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
explained O
. O
" O

There O
are O
no O
alienated O
working O
conditions O
, O
the O
tenants O
are O
not O
numbers O
and O
in O
the O
long O
term O
they O
will O
determine O
the O
business O
policy O
" O
, O
Schneider B-PER

Sufficient O
control O
bodies O
were O
installed O
, O
they O
assured O
that O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
tenants O
would O
again O
be O
exposed O
to O
uncertainties O
such O
as O
had O
arisen O
after O
the O
bankruptcy O
of O
the O
previous O
owner O
New O
Homeland O
. O

However O
, O
not O
all O
tenants O
seem O
convinced O
of O
this O
. O

They O
are O
satisfied O
with O
the O
management O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
by O
the O
Nassauische B-ORG
Heimst√§tte I-ORG
and O
see O
through O
the O
vote O
and O
the O
discussion O
about O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
brought O
unnecessary O
unrest O
to O
the O
Sachsenh√§user B-MISC
Wohnviertel O
. O

The O
uncertainty O
of O
many O
tenants O
also O
contributes O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
maintenance O
status O
of O
the O
apartments O
is O
not O
good O
. O

Only O
recently O
the O
gas O
pipelines O
in O
the O
settlement O
had O
to O
be O
taken O
off O
the O
grid O
because O
the O
money O
for O
a O
remediation O
was O
missing O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
cooperative O
are O
nevertheless O
optimistic O
: O

" O
We O
will O
work O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
tenants O
in O
the O
required O
majority O
support O
the O
takeover O
, O
" O
said O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
. O

Will O
it O
be O
possible O
to O
inspire O
almost O
67 O
percent O
of O
tenants O
for O
the O
first O
establishment O
of O
a O
housing O
cooperative O
after O
the O

of O

The O

the O

seven O

Because O

now O
fundamentally O

The O

The O

Already O
around O
1930 O
the O

was O
largely O
managed O

that O

of O
a O

that O

Meireis B-PER
explained O
very O
clearly O
: O

" O
The O
situation O
of O
the O
children O
in O
the O

extremely O
bad O

" O

The O
numbers O

: O

Only O

took O

in O
the O

, O

explained O

The O
question O
from O
the O
local O

on O
how O
to O
improve O
this O
precarious O
situation O
brought O
the O
youth O
doctor O
to O
a O
simple O
formula O
: O

" O
If O
you O
want O
to O

more O
, O
you O
need O
more O

" O

It O
is O

the O

of O

The O

( O

During O
the O
recent O

of O
the O

, O
the O
district O

also O
dealt O
with O
these O
two O

, O
which O
have O
for O
some O
time O
been O
causing O
fierce O
disputes O
between O
the O

With O
the O

of O
their O
city O

Ulrich B-PER
Baier I-PER
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
first O
tried O
to O
enforce O
an O
application O
in O
the O
local O
council O
, O
in O
which O
they O
demanded O
that O
the O
" O
expulsion O
" O
of O
the O

from O
the O
Taunusanlage B-MISC
remains O
until O
enough O
new O
facilities O
are O
created O
for O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC

. O

So O
far O
, O
according O
to O
the O
applicant O
Michael B-PER
Kr√§mer I-PER
( O
Greens B-ORG
) O
, O
the O
evacuation O
of O
the O
Taunus B-MISC

has O
only O
the O
consequence O
that O
the O
" O
scene O
" O
is O
relocated O
to O
the O

. O

In O
the O
Taunus B-MISC

the O
impairment O
of O
residents O
remained O
" O
limited O
" O
, O
but O
the O
relocation O
had O
effects O
in O
adjacent O
areas O
- O
for O
example O
in O
the O
station B-LOC

, O
according O
to O
Kr√§mer B-PER
. O

Ulrich B-PER
Baier I-PER
brought O
numbers O
into O
the O
discussion O
: O

A O
total O
of O
about O
600 O
drug O
addicts O
are O
involved O
. O

And O
even O
if O
half O
of O
them O
were O
" O
foreigners O
" O
who O
could O
be O
sent O
back O
to O
the O

, O
there O

For O
those O
there O
are O
" O
not O

" O
stressed O
Baier B-PER

But O
the O

not O

of O
the O

Alexander B-PER

The O

On O

opposed O

They O
share O
the O
fears O
of O
the O
other O

of O
the O

that O

The O

the O
German B-MISC

gaining O
in O

in O
Europe B-LOC

But O
it O
is O
also O
about O
the O
confrontation O
with O
the O

After O
all O
, O
this O

was O

until O
the O

character O

Now O
that O
borders O
in O
Europe B-LOC
are O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
important O
, O
new O
opportunities O
are O
opening O
up O
: O

The O
Alsatian B-MISC
is O
a O
Frenchman B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
a O
European O
with O
his O
own O
, O
regional O
, O
historically O
rooted O
identity O
, O
whose O
cultural O
symbol O
is O
bilingualism O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go O
until O
such O
a O
mission O
statement O
is O
achieved O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
it O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
irrevocably O
reversing O
a O
trend O
that O
started O
after O
the O
war O
and O
which O
in O
traditional O
German O
- O
speaking B-MISC
Alsace B-LOC
made O
German B-MISC
largely O
a O
foreign O
language O
. O

Suppressed O
, O
even O
forbidden O
were O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
and O
the O
High B-MISC
German I-MISC
as O
its O
written O
form O
of O
expression O
not O
. O

But O
the O
framework O
conditions O
ensured O
that O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
and O
the O
German B-MISC
were O
pushed O
back O
more O
and O
more O
. O

Thus O
many O
local O
and O
street O
signs O
were O
Frenchized B-MISC
. O

The O
official O
correspondence O
could O
soon O
after O
the O
war O
only O
be O
conducted O
in O
French B-MISC
. O

In O
the O
kindergartens O
at O
first O
even O
Alsatian B-MISC
homeland O
songs O
disappeared O
from O
the O
program O
. O

German B-MISC
teaching I-MISC
at O
schools O
has O
been O
reduced O
. O

In O
the O
German B-MISC
- O
language O
editions O
of O
the O
daily O
newspapers O
, O
the O
popular O
sports O
section O
had O
to O
appear O
in O
French B-MISC

In O
not O
a O
few O
families O
existed O
and O
exist O
two O
language O
worlds O
: O

Parents O
talk O
in O
the O
dialect O
, O
the O
conversations O
with O
the O
children O
take O
place O
in O
French B-MISC
. O

The O
consequence O
: O

In O
Alsace B-LOC
, O
quickly O
developed O
into O
a O
dominant O
colloquial O
language O
. O

The O
German B-MISC
- O
language O
editions O
of O
the O
regional O
expenditures O
lost O
and O
are O
still O
losing O
circulation O
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
younger O
people O
are O
no O
longer O
powerful O
in O
Alsace B-MISC
. O

In O
the O
restaurant O
the O
patron O
German B-MISC
guests O
, O
who O
do O
not O
speak O
French B-MISC
, O
can O
often O
still O
help O
linguistically O
, O
which O
is O
usually O
not O
possible O
of O
the O
young O
waitress O
or O
seller O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
1970s O
, O
ECEurope B-LOC
did O
not O
remain O
ineffective O
- O
German B-MISC
teaching I-MISC
at O
schools O
was O
again O
expanded O
. O

The O
French B-MISC
and O
Baden B-MISC
school O
authorities O
agreed O
on O
a O
program O
to O
promote O
the O
playful O
learning O
of O
the O
" O
language O
of O
the O
neighbour O
" O
already O
in O
primary O
school O
age O
, O
mutual O
class O
visits O
included O
, O
and O
the O
resonance O
in O
the O
schools O
was O
enormous O
. O

But O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
a O
real O
" O
bilinguisme O
" O
associations O
such O
as O
the O
Ren√© O
- O
Schickele B-ORG
circle I-ORG
, O
which O
makes O
itself O
for O
bilingualism O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
- I-LOC
Lorraine I-LOC
, O
had O
to O
feel O
for O
a O
long O
time O
still O
as O
a O
lonely O
caller O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

But O
with O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Wall O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
the O
Iron B-MISC
Curtain I-MISC
in O
Europe B-LOC
it O
has O
become O
almost O
chic O
in O
the O
social O
life O
of O
Alsace B-LOC
to O
stand O
up O
for O
" O
le O
bilinguisme O
" O
. O

The O
most O
visible O
expression O
of O
this O
development O
: O

In O
more O
and O
more O
places O
the O
French B-MISC
street O
names O
are O
provided O
with O
Alsatian B-MISC
subtitles O
. O

So O
now O
in O
M√ºlhausen B-LOC
is O
called O
the O
" O
Rue B-LOC
des I-LOC
Marechaux I-LOC
" O
also O
" O
Schmidgass B-LOC
" O
, O
in O
Colmar B-LOC
the O
" O
Rue B-LOC
des I-LOC
Pr√™tres I-LOC
" O
with O
the O
for O
German B-MISC
ears O
somewhat O
disrespectful O
sounding O
title O
" O
Pfaffegassle B-LOC
" O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
core O
issue O
is O
language O
teaching O
in O
schools O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
teaching O
of O
German B-MISC
at O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
schools O
is O
further O
intensified O

In O
the O
school O
year O
that O
has O
now O
expired O
, O
three O
hours O
per O
week O
outside O
the O
usual O
German B-MISC
lessons I-MISC
were O
spoken O
in O
different O
subjects O
in O
a O
model O
project O
of O
around O
60 O
classes O
in O
30 O
primary O
schools O
. O

A O
spectacular O
success O
was O
achieved O
by O
the O
ABCM B-MISC
citizens I-MISC
' O
initiative O
, O
which O
has O
already O
joined O
about O
800 O
parents O
and O
teachers O
: O

Supported O
by O
subsidies O
from O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
Regional O
Council O
, O
the O
two O
General O
Councils O
and O
even O
the O
EC B-ORG
, O
with O
the O
practical O
help O
of O
some O
local O
authorities O
, O
six O
really O
bilingual O
preschool O
classes O
could O
now O
be O
set O
up O
, O
in O
which O
13 O
hours O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
13 O
hours O
of O
German B-MISC
are O
spoken O
. O

This O
first O
significant O
progress O
towards O
bilinguisme O
demonstrates O
that O
the O
proponents O
of O
bilingualism O
are O
still O
facing O
a O
stubborn O
opponent O
- O
and O
that O
is O
to O
say O
" O
Paris B-LOC

He O
is O
present O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
National O
School O
Authority O
. O

Since O
1982 O
, O
a O
law O
has O
in O
principle O
allowed O
equal O
education O
in O
French B-MISC
and O
the O
respective O
regional O
language O
, O
if O
parents O
so O
wish O
. O

This O
directive O
was O
implemented O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
in O
Brittany B-LOC
, O
but O
not O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

The O
real O
concern O
of O
ABCM B-ORG
is O
the O
establishment O
of O
bilingual O
classes O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
official O
state O
school O
system O
. O

The O
municipal O
council O
of O
M√ºlhausen B-LOC
also O
took O
a O
decision O
to O
this O
effect O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
hearing O
, O
ABCM B-ORG
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
make O
a O
first O
move O
with O
bilingual O
kindergartens O
on O
a O
private O
basis O
. O

But O
even O
these O
initiatives O
are O
resisted O
in O
some O
places O
, O
the O
promised O
subsidies O
of O
the O
EC B-ORG
and O
of O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
local O
authorities O
can O
not O
be O
fully O
used O
, O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
opportunity O
: O

At O
times O
, O
the O
local O
authorities O
did O
not O
provide O
any O
rooms O
, O
with O
ABCM B-ORG
suspects O
that O
the O
State O
School O
Authority O
sometimes O
also O
exerts O
pressure O
on O
mayors O
. O

In O
the O
most O
spectacular O
dispute O
in O
Powdersheim B-LOC
the O
educators O
of O
the O
state O
school O
, O
with O
the O
back O
of O
a O
teacher O
's O
association O
, O
resist O
that O
in O
the O
same O
building O
in O
one O
( O
otherwise O
unused O
! O

) O
Rooms O
a O

class I-MISC
has O
been O
accommodated O
. O

The O
Mairie O
and O
the O
school O
administration O
met O
in O
court O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
matter O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
settled O
. O

After O
all O
: O

" O
State O
" O
and O
" O
private O
" O
children O
can O
now O
use O
the O
same O
toilet O
and O
also O
play O
together O
in O
the O
breaks O
- O
which O
initially O
did O
not O
go O
. O

" O
Haut B-ORG
Comit√© I-ORG
" O
- O
President O
Goetschy B-PER
complains O
that O
there O
are O
still O
too O
few O
dialect O
broadcasts O
on O
radio O
and O
television O
. O

Concerned O
, O
the O
politician O
is O
that O
the O
recent O
reform O
of O
the O
French B-MISC
Constitution O
explicitly O
states O
that O
French B-MISC
is O
the O
" O
language O
of O
the O
Republic O
" O
, O
but O
that O
no O
mention O
is O
made O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
regional O
languages O
. O

The O
proponents O
of O
bilingualism O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
are O
probably O
not O
wrong O
with O
their O
assumption O
that O
behind O
disinterest O
and O
persistent O
resistance O
in O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
there O
is O
the O
fear O
of O
a O
creeping O
" O
Germanization B-MISC
" O
of O
Alsace B-LOC
, O
before O
a O
" O
drift O
" O
of O
this O
region O
, O
even O
the O
will O
not O
to O
reveal O
the O
dominance O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
thus O
also O
of O
the O
political O
priority O
of O
centralism O
in O
any O
way O
. O

But O
even O
the O
most O
decisive O
supporters O
of O
" O
bilinguisme O
" O
clearly O
define O
themselves O
as O
French B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
as O
Europeans B-MISC
and O
Alsatians B-MISC
, O
who O
want O
to O
preserve O
and O
rebuild O
a O
social O
and O
cultural O
regional O
identity O
in O
a O
growing O
Europe B-LOC
through O
bilingualism O
. O

So O
not O
only O
in O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
there O
is O
resistance O
to O
overcome O
. O

In O
Alsace B-LOC
itself O
, O
contradictions O
also O
arise O
. O

Thus O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
Strasbourg B-ORG
City I-ORG
Council I-ORG
to O
subtitle O
60 O
streets O
and O
squares O
with O
their O
historical O
German B-MISC
names O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
European B-MISC
city I-MISC
, O
met O
with O
unexpectedly O
violent O
protest O
, O
which O
was O
reflected O
in O
numerous O
letters O
from O
the O
readers O
of O
ebbing O
Strasbourg B-MISC
citizens O
and O
in O
thoughtful O
comments O
in O
the O
media O
. O

According O
to O
the O
critics O
, O
German B-MISC
is O
not O
only O
the O
language O
of O
the O
Strasbourg B-MISC
student O
Goethe B-PER
, O
but O
also O
the O
language O
of O
Hitler B-PER
. O

There O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
the O
Nazi B-MISC
time I-MISC
in O
Alsace B-LOC
certainly O
continues O
as O
a O
trauma O
. O

For O
months O
this O
dispute O
lasted O
until O
finally O
a O
compromise O
was O
found O
: O

The O
signs O
on O
the O
streets O
and O
squares O
do O
not O
get O
any O
German B-MISC
, O
but O
Alsatian B-MISC
additional O
names O
- O
as O
already O
in O
many O
places O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

Ultimately O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
supporters O
of O
bilingualism O
can O
see O
themselves O
in O
the O
unstoppable O
trend O
of O
time O
. O

The O
practical O
experience O
and O
requirements O
of O
the O
EC B-MISC
internal I-MISC
market I-MISC
alone O
encourage O
the O
tendency O
to O
bilinguisme O
. O

After O
all O
, O
around O
60 O

Alsatians B-MISC
are O
already O
working O
in O
the O
Greater O

The O
initial O
skepticism O
among O
the O
" O
adult O
" O
politicians O
has O
gone O
by O
. O

But O
how O
do O
the O
young O
people O
themselves O
see O
their O
Parliament O
? O

" O
It O
has O
taken O
place O
" O
, O
says O
Karl B-PER
Thomas I-PER
Koehnen I-PER
, O
member O
of O
the O
coordination O
committee O
of O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
, O
with O
a O
view O
to O
the O
last O
year O
, O
which O
brought O
a O
lot O
of O
experience O
, O
but O
so O
far O
few O
successes O
. O

The O
steps O
of O
the O
young O
Bad B-MISC
Homburger I-MISC
went O
first O
to O
give O
the O
work O
of O
the O
youth O
parliament O
a O
fixed O
framework O
to O
give O
young O
people O
an O
opportunity O
to O
influence O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
Council O
of O
Elders O
of O
the O
City O
Parliament O
has O
now O
decided O
to O
grant O
the O
young O
people O
the O
right O
to O
speak O
on O
the O
committees O
, O
but O
only O
on O
the O
requests O
they O
have O
made O
. O

" O
We O
did O
n't O
find O
a O
right O
to O
speak O
in O
all O
points O
so O
cheaply O
, O
" O
says O
Mayor O
Maria B-PER
Scholz I-PER
. O

It O
has O
accompanied O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

In O
their O
view O
, O
it O
was O
right O
to O
limit O
the O
influence O
of O
young O
people O
, O
but O
to O
place O
them O
in O
a O
duty O
to O
learn O
to O
listen O
and O
ask O
questions O
on O
the O
points O
they O
are O
presenting O
. O

This O
pedagogical O
approach O
disturbs O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
Green B-MISC
Group I-MISC
in O
the O
city O
parliament O
, O
Renate B-PER
Bill I-PER
. O

It O
fears O
that O
a O
" O
potential O
of O
conflict O
" O
of O
young O
people O
, O
which O
should O
also O
be O
used O
constructively O
, O
will O
be O
steered O
" O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
" O
by O
parliamentary O
work O
. O

Much O
can O
be O
better O
achieved O
in O
open O
youth O
work O
. O

Peter B-PER
Walz I-PER
of O
the O
E B-ORG

Werk I-ORG
also O
fears O
that O
this O
will O
" O
combine O
energies O
that O
could O
be O
released O
elsewhere O
" O
. O

For O
him O
, O
a O
youth O
parliament O
does O
not O
exist O
, O
" O
if O
nothing O
can O
prevail O
" O
. O

The O
young O
people O
do O
not O
have O
that O
little O
hope O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
is O
important O
for O
them O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
parliamentary O
life O
. O
" O

Only O
then O
do O
we O
take O
part O
in O
the O
decisions O
" O
, O
says O
Markus B-PER
Schulz I-PER
, O
who O
is O
also O
in O
the O
coordination O
committee O
. O

The O
results O
are O
particularly O
important O
to O
him O

" O
We O
must O
be O
able O
to O
show O
something O
. O

Then O
the O
young O
people O
take O
this O
seriously O
and O
continue O
to O
support O
us O
. O
" O

For O
the O
young O
parliamentarians O
have O
recognized O
one O
thing O
: O

Without O
support O
from O
peers O
, O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
does O
not O
go O
any O
further O
. O
" O

We O
are O
really O
just O
the O
representatives O
. O

We O
can O
only O
pass O
on O
what O
youths O
bring O
to O
us O
. O
" O

This O
view O
is O
also O
so O
vehemently O
expressed O
by O
them O
that O
they O
do O
not O
want O
" O
such O
a O
mentality O
to O
emerge O
: O

" O
We O
have O
our O
officials O
now O
and O
they O
're O
already O
doing O
it O
. O
" O

Only O
a O
few O
suggestions O
have O
reached O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
so O
far O
. O

Perhaps O
because O
the O
young O
people O
themselves O
had O
to O
penetrate O
the O
depths O
of O
local O
politics O
first O
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
this O
is O
concerned O
, O
now O
even O
her O
once O
biggest O
critic O
, O
FDP B-MISC
faction I-MISC
leader I-MISC
Wolfgang B-PER
Hof I-PER
, O
pulls O
the O

: O

" O
I O

a O
better O
one O
, O
" O
says O
Hof B-PER
, O
who O
is O
impressed O
by O
the O
" O
astounding O
pragmatism O

Very O
quickly O
they O
would O
have O
seen O
how O
municipal O
policy O
works O
. O
" O

And O
then O
it O

, O

that O

. O

A O
hope O
that O
also O
shares O
the O
SPD B-MISC
leader I-MISC
Beate B-PER
Fleige I-PER
. O

It O
considers O
it O
crucial O
that O
" O
now O
also O
young O
people O
themselves O
articulate O
what O
they O
need O
" O
. O

That O
's O
not O
so O
much O
that O
has O
yet O
come O
, O
" O
says O
the O
CDU B-MISC
Group I-MISC
leader I-MISC
Franz B-PER
Kaunzner I-PER
. O

He O
sees O
the O
youth O
parliament O
primarily O
as O
a O
training O
room O
: O

" O
Sometimes O
if O
you O
look O
at O
how O
great O
ignorance O
is O
" O
, O
the O
participation O
in O
the O
youth O
parliament O
with O
young O
people O
can O
certainly O
contribute O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
opinion O
. O

What O
he O
admonishes O
, O
however O
, O
is O
continuity O
: O

" O
If O
they O
send O
a O
different O
representative O
each O
time O
, O
it O
wo O
n't O
work O
. O
" O

The O
young O
people O
have O
also O
recognized O
this O
: O

They O
do O
not O
want O
to O
pay O
homage O
to O
the O
principle O
of O
rotation O
. O

But O
even O
they O
will O
grow O
out O
of O
adolescence O
once O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
their O
term O
of O
office O
is O
for O
the O
time O
being O
one O
year O
. O

What O
comes O
after O
, O
even O
the O
young O
people O
do O
not O
know O
. O

They O
strongly O
resist O
to O
regard O
their O
institution O
as O
a O
junior O
smithy O
: O

" O
Nothing O

been O

Koehnen B-PER

Anyone O
who O
wants O

go O
right O

himself O

When O
the O

be O

no O

wants O
to O

G√ºnther B-PER

has O
already O
made O
this O
experience O
painful O

Recently O
he O
wanted O
to O
cross O
the O

with O
four O
children O
, O
almost O
he O
would O
have O
been O

The O
horror O
has O
now O
turned O
into O
trouble O
: O

" O
Something O

to O
happen O

" O

Resident O
Gisela B-PER
Becker I-PER
considers O
the O
" O
autobahn O
" O
extension O
of O
the O
road O
to O
be O
a O
fundamental O
mistake O
. O

Because O
with O
60 O
kilometers O
per O
hour O
the O
cars O
can O
drive O
on O
the O
road O
between O
Bokkenheim B-LOC
and O
the O
Westend B-LOC
. O

Also O
in O
the O
local B-ORG
council I-ORG
2 I-ORG
is O
thought O
about O
how O
the O
connection O
of O
the O
districts O
could O
be O
made O
safer O
. O

Already O
in O
1991 O
the O
Advisory O
Council O
had O
demanded O
a O
bus O
lane O
to O
push O
the O
car O
traffic O
back O
to O
five O
tracks O
- O
in O
vain O
. O

The O
district O
politicians O
have O
now O
launched O
a O
new O
initiative O
: O

At O
the O
request O
of O
the O
SPD B-MISC
Group I-MISC
, O
they O
called O
for O
the O
section O
between O
the O
junction O
of O
Sophienstra√üe B-LOC
and O
Bockenheimer B-LOC
Landstra√üe I-LOC
( O
the O
FR B-ORG
) O
. O

" O
The O
existing O
islands O
are O
so O
narrow O
in O
their O
width O
" O
, O
G√ºnter B-PER
Zenk I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
explained O
the O
initiative O
, O
" O
that O
actually O
only O
foldable O
bicycles O
should O
be O
allowed O
. O
" O

But O
even O
the O
advance O
has O
little O
chance O
of O
being O
implemented O
. O

Klaus B-PER
Wetterling I-PER
, O
responsible O
for O
municipal O
development O
and O
urban O
planning O
for O

off O
: O

No O

In O

the O

: O

Wetterling B-PER
: O

" O
There O
we O
ca O
n't O
just O
arrange O

. O
" O

This O
is O
only O
possible O
if O
" O
the O
local O
situation O
has O
a O
narrow O
road O
" O
. O

But O
here O
, O
as O
transport O
initiatives O
in O
other O
cases O
have O
already O
emphasized O
, O
the O
cat O
bites O
in O
the O
tail O
: O

It O
is O
raced O
because O
the O
road O
is O
wide O
; O
and O
because O
the O
road O
is O
wide O
, O
the O
permitted O
top O
speed O
must O
not O
be O
drastically O
lowered O
. O

So O
they O
keep O
racing O
. O

Anton B-PER
Winter I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
had O
already O
assumed O
during O
the O
meeting O
of O
the O
Advisory O
Council O
that O
the O
city O
would O
by O
no O
means O
prescribe O
a O
speed O
30 O
at O
the O
Allenring B-LOC
- O
and O
thus O
also O
justify O
the O
rejection O
of O
his O
group O
. O

With O
a O
speed O
reduction O
it O
is O
not O
done O
, O
Winter B-PER
said O
beyond O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
islands O
would O
have O
to O
be O
enlarged O
. O

Only O
then O
would O
pedestrians O
be O
safer O
. O

A O
view O
that O
also O
supported O
G√ºnther B-PER
Boege I-PER
. O

But O
the O
SPD B-MISC
faction I-MISC
could O
not O
get O
along O
with O
the O
idea O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

A O
conversion O
of O
the O
entire O
intersection O
will O
only O
be O
useful O
, O
argued O
its O
chairman O
Bernd B-PER
Scherf I-PER
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
subway O
construction O
will O
be O
completed O
. O

Before O
, O
such O
a O
' O
project O
is O
far O
too O
expensive O
. O

Traffic O
planner O
Klaus B-PER
Wetterling I-PER
shares O
this O
view O
. O

It O
was O
only O
six O
years O
ago O
that O
the O
square O
had O
been O
redesigned O
for O
underground O
construction O
. O
" O

Even O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
every O

why O
should O
we O
now O
pay O

to O

" O

Hilde B-PER

she O

the O
moments O

When O

: O

The O
Nieder B-MISC

The O

at O

highly O
desirable O
for O

difficult O
to O

. O

The O
existing O

, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
too O
small O
years O

, O
should O
be O

this O
purpose O

As O
a O
result O

at O
least O
two O

In O
the O

, O
no O

Moreover O
, O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC

director O

believes O
that O
, O
due O
to O
the O

in O

, O
no O
intact O

even O
if O

, O
should O
be O

Especially O
in O

, O
where O
in O
any O
case O
only O
two O
sports O

a O

are O
available O
, O
such O
an O
action O
would O
exacerbate O
the O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
larger O
hall O
on O
the O

of O
the O
Michael B-LOC

would O

The O
students O

, O
who O
do O
not O

would O
take O
a O

foot O
to O
get O
there O
. O

With O
a O

this O

As O
the O

In O

I O

However O
, O
the O

almost O
no O

And O
to O
negotiate O
with O
the O

about O

the O

Weiser O
also O
responds O
to O
the O
argument O
of O
the O
First O
Councillor O
Klaus B-PER

, O
the O
paragraph O

of O
the O
Federal O

" O

Looking O
at O

out O

Paragraph O
34 O
does O
not O
protect O
that O
much O

" O

In O
this O
context O
, O
Weiser B-PER
also O
pointed O
to O
the O
wild O
growth O
of O
advertising O
facilities O
. O

According O
to O
the O
jurisprudence O
, O
this O
could O
not O
be O
limited O
to O
paragraph O
34 O
, O
but O
only O
to O
a O
set O
of O
rules O

Above O
all O
, O
however O
, O
the O
coordination O
of O
the O
construction O
projects O
favored O
by O
the O

with O
the O

only O
obscures O
the O

reality O
, O
since O
the O
agreed O
design O
regulation O
explicitly O
provides O
for O
its O
extension O
if O
necessary O

" O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
now O
possible O
for O
the O
administration O
to O
prevent O
its O
unpleasant O
construction O

by O
threatening O

out O

The O
result O
: O

" O
The O
builders O
do O
not O
know O
what O
the O
city O
wants O
. O

Suddenly O
they O
are O
threatened O

" O

This O
does O
not O
happen O
if O
there O

would O

to O
make O

they O
also O
contribute O
to O
the O
fact O

In O

also O

all O

to O

pieces O

the O

to O
inspire O
for O
the O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
singers O
see O
themselves O
as O
victims O
of O
the O
dilemma O
that O
a O
composer O
only O
composes O
if O
he O
also O
knows O
that O
this O

is O
bought O
from O
him O

And O
this O
, O
according O
to O
Claus O

Peter B-PER

, O
is O
still O
not O
a O
matter O
of O

with O

The O
trend O
of O
many O

still O
goes O
there O

what O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O

have O
little O
literature O
that O
is O
appealing O
to O

, O
explains O

gets O
swarmed O
about O
the O
choral O
adaptations O
of O
the O
Beatles B-MISC
Song I-MISC
" O
Let O
it O
be O
" O
. O

In O
his O
view O
, O
new O

also O
allowed O
a O
stronger O
examination O
of O
the O
present O

" O

When O

the O

has O
a O

it O
could O
also O
be O

if O

found O
for O
this O
, O
the O

open O
themselves O
to O

and O
care O
for O

, O
the O
choir O

in O

opinion O
can O
have O
a O
future O
. O

Some O
choirs O
in O

also O
prophesies O
their O
extinction O

Other O
choirs O
, O
such O
as O
the O

from O

the O

" O
, O
let O
him O
look O
hopefully O
into O
the O
future O
. O

Especially O
since O
the O
singing O
for O
him O
beyond O
the O
purely O
musical O
also O
promotes O
the O
" O
community O
sense O
" O
. O

In O
our O

a O

the O
group O
dynamic O
aspect O
as O
an O
" O
important O
by O

also O
finds O
that O
" O

most O

Even O
more O

it O
would O

so O
his O

The O

called O
for O

also O
mean O
the O

to O
make O
new O

But O
that O

which O
makes O
the O

is O
different O
from O

The O

after O
which O
the O

today O
the O

In O
the O

statement O

, O
the O

welcomed O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
FVV B-ORG
reduced O

significantly O
reduces O

At O

, O
however O
, O
the O

at O

lost O
again O

as O

there O
would O
have O

wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
" O

" O
. O

The O
proposal O
was O
adopted O
unanimously O
by O
the O
district O
politicians O
. O

The O
agreement O
of O
the O
local O
advisory O
council O
to O
a O
second O
SPD B-MISC
initiative I-MISC
was O
not O
quite O
as O
unanimous O
. O

In O
the O
first O
part O
of O
the O
proposal O
, O
the O
Social B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
demanded O
that O
the O
44 O
buses O
run O
every O
10 O
, O
every O
20 O
minutes O
until O
8 O
p.m. O
and O
every O
half O
hour O
thereafter O
. O

For O
a O
denser O
clock O
of O
the O
" O
44ers O
" O
nevertheless O
as O
many O
places O
with O
passengers O
are O
occupied O
, O
smaller O
buses O
are O
to O
be O
used O
. O

The O
local O
council O
agreed O
to O
the O
request O
against O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
CDU B-MISC
Group I-MISC
. O

As O
its O
chairman O
Dieter B-PER
Kunzler I-PER
said O
, O
the O
44 O
is O
anyway O
a O
" O
spirit O
bus O
" O
, O
which O
is O
especially O
in O
the O
evening O
hours O
hardly O
used O
. O

He O
called O
it O
" O
not O
particularly O
useful O
" O
to O
let O
the O
bus O
roll O
even O
more O
often O
" O
through O
the O
narrow O
streets O
of O
Fechenheim B-LOC
" O
. O

This O
is O
no O
argument O
against O
a O
shorter O
time O
clock O
, O
said O
Albrecht B-PER
Reinhard I-PER
( O
FDP B-ORG
) O
. O

Just O
because O
the O
bus O
is O
so O
rare O
, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
cheap O
means O
of O
transport O
and O
is O
therefore O
little O
used O
. O

This O
will O
change O
if O
the O
44er O
drives O
more O
frequently O
, O
speculated O
the O
free O
democrat O
. O

According O
to O
a O
magistrate O
report O
, O
this O
has O
been O
confirmed O
everywhere O
where O
the O
bus O
is O
easy O
to O
reach O
by O
subway O
, O
says O
Reinhard B-PER
. O

The O
second O
part O

the O

required O

her O

the O
" O
Burglehen B-LOC
" O
- O
in O
the O
district O
known O
as O
" O
Linneplatz B-LOC
" O
. O

Objective O
of O
the O
action O
: O

The O
adults O
wanted O
to O
show O
that O
their O
older O
offspring O
on O
the O
playground O
there O
lack O
equipment O
to O
play O
. O

The O
place O
had O
been O
established O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Another O
drawback O
: O

The O
place O
is O
often O
driven O
by O
cars O
that O
have O
nothing O
to O
look O
for O
there O
. O

Because O
the O
" O
Burglehen O
" O
, O
a O
large O
, O
with O
square O
stones O
paved O
place O
in O
the O
Fechenheimer B-MISC

center O
, O
is O
pedestrian O
zone O
. O

Actually O
, O
only O
some O
residents O
with O
appropriate O
ID O
cards O
should O
drive O
over O
the O
" O
Linneplatz B-LOC
" O
, O
between O
5 O
and O
11 O
o'clock O
are O
also O
approved O
suppliers O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
, O
the O
parents O
wanted O
to O
block O
the O
Starkenburger B-LOC
Stra√üe I-LOC
, O
from O
which O
the O
square O
can O
be O
reached O

However O
, O
since O
the O
action O
was O
supported O
by O
two O
honorary O
staff O
, O
the O
initiative O
had O
to O
abandon O
this O
project O
. O

For O
the O
staff O
of O
an O
authority O
is O
expressly O
forbidden O
to O
participate O
in O
such O
- O
soberly O
considered O
- O
illegal O
acts O
. O

But O
the O
parents O
did O
not O
want O
to O
give O
up O
the O
help O
of O
the O
two O
educators O
and O
the O
playground O
equipment O
of O
the O
children O
's O
office O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
game O
week O
had O
gone O
well O
without O
street O
blockade O
, O
said O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
, O
mother O
of O
five O
children O
. O

On O
the O
first O
two O
days O
about O
30 O
children O
had O
been O
there O
, O
painted O
and O
murmured O
in O
the O

, O
drew O
the O
little O

on O
two O
solar O

which O
still O
have O
to O
be O
sewn O
together O
. O

Also O
a O
wall O
of O
the O
playground O
is O
still O
painted O
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
of O
the O
game O
week O
the O
rain O
then O
temporarily O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
joyous O

and O
bustle O
around O
the O
" O
Linnespielplatz B-LOC

. O

Already O
about O
three O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
competent O
local O
council O
was O
working O
to O
block O
the O
" O
Burglehen B-LOC
" O
for O
the O
transit O
traffic O
and O
to O
establish O
a O
children O
's O
playground O
there O
. O

Last O
year O
a O
small O
playground O
was O
laid O
out O
in O
an O
angle O
in O
the O
front O
area O
of O
the O

on O
Starkenburger B-LOC

Some O

a O
few O
play O
equipment O
- O
for O
boys O
and O
girls O
who O
are O
no O
longer O
in O

age O
, O
the O
offer O
is O
somewhat O
meager O
. O

This O
will O
be O
better O
in O
the O
future O
: O

The O
city O
youth O
wants O
to O
equip O
the O
" O
linne B-LOC
playground I-LOC
" O
additionally O
with O
balls O
, O
tires O
, O
stilts O
and O
other O
play O
equipment O
. O

The O
toys O
are O
to O
be O
placed O
in O
a O
lockable O

and O
some O
keys O
are O
to O
be O
distributed O
to O
the O

. O

On O
the O
wooden O
playhouse O
, O
which O
the O
children O
wanted O
, O
the O
little O
ones O
will O
have O
to O
give O
up O
. O

The O
construction O
of O
such O
a O
hut O
is O
too O
complex O
and O
also O
linked O
with O
numerous O
safety O
requirements O
, O
said O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER

Replacement O
offered O
during O
the O
play O
week O
a O
wooden O
climbing O
frame O
of O
the O
children O
's O
office O
. O

A O
major O
disadvantage O
of O
the O
playground O
remains O
: O

He O
is O
simply O
too O
small O
to O
accommodate O
all O
the O
children O
who O
want O
to O
play O
there O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
offspring O
has O
already O
taken O
possession O
of O
a O
part O
of O
Linneplatz B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
however O
, O
the O
children O
do O
not O
play O
undisturbed O

For O

as O

When O
the O
CDU B-ORG
then O
ruled O
in O
Wiesbaden B-LOC
, O
the O
magistrate O
presented O
a O
second O
plan O
, O
which O
was O
hardly O
different O
from O
the O
first O
. O

In O
1988 O
, O
before O
the O
state O
elections O
and O
the O
subsequent O
change O
of O
government O
, O
the O
Hessian B-MISC
Interior O
Minister O
blessed O
the O
development O
plan O
380 O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
there O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
built O
is O
due O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
to O
the O
complex O
conversion O
process O
for O
the O
area O
: O

The O
" O
stone B-LOC
" O
is O
composed O
of O
many O
small O
plots O
, O
which O
run O
as O
narrow O
stripes O
in O
north O
- O
south O
direction O
. O

An O
exception O
here O
makes O
the O
mentioned O
approximately O
1060 O
square O
meters O
large O
plot O
in O
the O
west O
of O
the O
area O
, O
on O
which O
is O
already O
a O
concrete O
foundation O
. O

The O
owners O
therefore O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
conversion O
, O
but O
could O
already O
start O
the O
construction O

Right O
at O
the O
beginning O
, O
the O
workers O
swirled O
up O
powerful O
dust O
there O
, O
which O
is O
why O
Klaus B-PER
Boller I-PER
was O
able O
to O
make O
a O
construction O
stop O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

Already O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
July O
he O
had O
filed O
an O
objection O
against O
the O
building O
permit O
, O
after O
he O
had O
seen O
these O
several O
days O
before O
. O

Several O
so O
- O
called O
exemptions O
from O
the O
original O
plan O
had O
been O
noticed O
by O
the O
tax O
specialist O
, O
who O
had O
been O
fighting O
against O
the O
cultivation O
of O
the O
feral O
orchard O
from O
the O
outset O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
requirement O
not O
to O
build O
terraced O
houses O
, O
the O
builders O
on O
the O
land O
in O
question O
may O
also O
deviate O
from O
the O
specified O
base O
area O
( O
GRZ O
) O
and O
the O
number O
of O
floors O
( O
GFZ O
) O
. O

These O
values O
indicate O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
built O
- O
up O
floor O
area O
and O
the O
area O
of O
all O
rooms O
of O
a O
house O
to O
the O
square O
meter O
of O
the O
entire O
building O
plot O
. O

The O
approved O
base O
and O
floor O
area O
figures O
were O
increased O
by O
40 O
and O
44 O
percent O
respectively O
in O
the O
building O
permit O
compared O
to O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
B O
380 O
. O

This O
means O
, O
to O
put O
it O
simply O
, O
that O
a O
larger O
part O
of O
the O
land O
will O
be O
added O
than O
originally O
intended O
. O

With O
his O

that O
with O

Also O
some O
of O

suspect O
that O
it O
will O
be O
nothing O
with O
the O

on O

sees O
an O
exception O
in O
the O
exemption O
that O
allows O
terraced O
houses O
on O
this O
sub O

. O

The O
elongated O

had O
offered O
itself O
" O
by O
chance O
" O
to O
build O
there O
a O
" O
long O
- O
stretched O
building O
" O
, O
explained O
by B-PER
guard I-PER
. O

Without O
the O
exemption O
, O
only O
one O
single O
house O
should O
have O
stood O
there O
, O
but O
due O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
building O
plot O
several O
houses O
are O
appropriate O
. O

However O
, O
these O
conditions O
would O
not O
generally O
apply O
to O
the O
" O
stone B-LOC
" O
, O
but O
only O
to O
this O
small O
section O
. O

The O
other O
two O
exemptions O
for O
the O
number O
of O
ground O
and O
floor O
areas O
were O
approved O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
" O
calculation O
error O
" O
, O
the O
Head O

It O
was O
erroneously O

that O
the O

However O
, O
both O
figures O

thoughtfulness O
, O
the O
assurance O
that O
the O
problem O
is O
taken O
seriously O
, O
etc O
. O

Kleinert B-PER
also O
sees O
the O
development O
outlined O
by O
him O
as O
a O
downside O
to O
the O
democratisation O
spurt O
, O
which O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
years O
has O
produced O
a O
considerable O
gain O
in O
individual O
freedom O
of O
choice O
. O

Policymakers O
had O
a O
harder O
time O
legitimising O
themselves O
, O
less O
willing O
to O
accept O
, O
without O
question O
, O
decisions O
of O
superior O
bodies O
. O

The O
sense O
of O
" O

social O
relations O
" O
, O
i.e. O
parties O
, O
trade O
unions O
or O
even O
associations O
, O
is O
also O
decreasing O
. O

According O
to O
Kleinert B-PER
, O
the O
weak O
design O
of O
politics O
is O
also O
the O
price O
that O
Western O
societies O
would O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
their O
high O
level O
of O
pluralism O
of O
interests O
, O
views O
and O
lifestyles O
. O
" O

In O
essence O
, O
it O
is O
questionable O
whether O
the O
democratisation O
level O
of O
the O
1980s O
can O
be O
maintained O
under O
the O
difficult O
conditions O
of O
the O
1990s O
" O
, O
he O
says O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
lack O
of O
personalities O
that O
have O
impressed O
, O
too O
many O
politicians O
have O
acted O
interchangeably O
, O
" O
a O
little O
like O
politicians O
from O
the O
pole O
" O
, O
writes O
Kleinert B-PER
. O

However O
, O
they O
are O
also O
a O
reflection O
of O
society O
, O
because O
such O
lawsuits O
exist O
in O
other O
professions O
, O
in O
sports O
, O
in O
art O
and O
in O
business O
. O
" O

Certainly O
" O
, O
Kleinert B-PER
said O
, O
" O
the O
leadership O
capacity O
of O
the O
political O
staff O
has O
decreased O
, O
while O
the O
vanity O
of O
the O
individual O
actors O
has O
increased O
. O
" O

With O
an O
increasing O
tendency O
, O
politicians O
tended O
to O
refer O
their O
judgments O
about O
themselves O
and O
their O
political O
performance O
solely O
from O
their O
reflection O
in O
the O
media O
. O

The O
necessary O
to O
quick O
shots O

spectacles O
, O
which O
sometimes O
make O
some O
swirls O
, O
but O
then O
also O
often O

forgotten O
again O

an O
aseptic O
note O
it O
is O
done O
to O
the O
German B-MISC

photographers O
in O
the O
30s O
: O

The O
free O

offered O
here O
the O
casual O
occasion O
to O
produce O
as O
forced O
as O
possible O
, O
dignified O
body O
images O
. O

Up O
to O
the O
unscathed O
, O
more O
aggressive O
images O
of O
the O
current O
nude O
photography O
can O
nevertheless O
be O
determined O
some O
commonalities O
of O
this O
genre O
. O

Mostly O
the O
body O
is O
used O
as O
docile O
material O
, O
sometimes O
as O
an O
entire O
nude O
figure O
, O
sometimes O
as O
a O
fragmented O
body O
landscape O
. O

The O
lust O
of O
the O
portrayed O
plays O
almost O
no O
role O
- O
what O
these O
pictures O
repeatedly O
reveal O
, O
are O
rather O
the O
fantasies O
of O
the O
photo O
- O
formers O
, O
projected O
on O
the O
bodies O
of O
their O
choice O
. O

And O
that O
's O
not O
always O
very O
imaginative O
. O

This O
is O
particularly O
evident O
in O
the O
historical O
distance O
. O

The O
pornographic O
images O
from O
the O
early O
days O
of O
photography O
, O
around O
1850 O
, O
appear O
only O
as O
images O
of O
their O
taste O
, O
hardly O
as O
erotic O
photographs O
. O

In O
touching O
flopness O
the O
exposed O
models O
are O
photographed O
, O
whereby O
the O
long O
exposure O
times O
may O
have O
reinforced O
the O
somewhat O
wooden O
poses O
. O

The O
shameless O
and O
unrepentant O
voyeurism O
experience O
of O
the O
viewer O
is O
the O
real O
goal O
of O
these O
images O
- O
their O
design O
secondary O
. O

The O
lust O
had O
already O
disappeared O
from O
the O
picture O
at O
that O
time O
. O

The O
partly O
drastic O
stagings O
of O
newer O
date O
mostly O
aim O
at O
the O
same O
, O
old O
effects O
. O

Since O
it O
is O
relaxing O
to O
also O
see O
alternatives O
to O
these O
spread O
beauties O
. O

Far O
from O
common O
ideals O
, O
for O
example O
, O
stands O
a O
chest O
image O
of O
Gundula B-PER
Schulze I-PER
. O

An O
old O
lady O
, O
frenzy O
, O
a O
little O
uncertain O
, O
but O
very O
serious O
in O
the O
camera O
flashing O
. O

The O
direct O
view O
from O
the O
picture O
makes O
us O
frighten O
, O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
voyeur O
present O
. O

And O
so O
the O
woman O
appears O
as O
a O
dignified O
portrait O
, O
as O
a O
character O
study O
, O
not O
a O
pleasure O
object O
. O

Similar O
to O
the O
old O
couple O
that O
the O
Swede B-MISC
Jan B-PER
Bengtsson I-PER
held O
in O
tender O
embrace O
. O

Scheidt B-PER
writes O
in O
the O
preface O
of O
the O
accompanying O
catalogue O
that O
he O
has O
put O
together O
" O
a O
purely O
subjective O
selection O
" O
. O

He O
fortunately O
does O
not O
make O
noble O
art O
claims O
. O

Equally O
subjective O
the O
exhibition O
should O
also O
be O

In O

something O

Too O
small O
spaces O

unsatisfactory O

situation O

In O

had O
a O

of O
the O

, O
as O

in O

a O

that O
resembles O
an O

rises O
above O
the O

He O
feared O
that O

an O

on O
the O
Offenbachers B-MISC

" O

That O
was O

not O
a O
false O
thought O

in O
that O
troubled O

And O
it O
should O
be O
confirmed O
: O

On O
8 O
March O
of O
the O

the O
citizens O
of O
the O

held O
a O
protest O

stormed O

took O
up O

Right O
fares O

were O
then O
only O
in O
April O
of O

In O
1875 O
the O

was O
shortened O
and O
the O
local B-LOC

was O
converted O
to O
the O
main B-LOC

But O
under O
" O
full O

the O
development O
progressed O
: O

The O

of O
the O

only O
nine O

later O

and O
that O

In O
1884 O
the O
connection O
between O

as O
one O
of O

Criticism O
of O
the O
steam O

came O
up O
. O

As O
early O
as O
1901 O
it O
was O
said O
that O
it O
was O
no O

Ultimately O
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
the O
favorable O
route O
of O
the O

through O

which O
led O
in O

In O
between O

was O
the O

fell O
partly O

Gradually O

The O

also O
not O

The O

The O

want O
to O

for O

also O
to O

In O

imagine O
that O

at O

We O
have O
just O
pointed O
out O
strict O

here O

the O

specifically O
to O
refrain O
from O
ringing O

" O

Hupe O

serve O
the O

only O
as O
a O

in O
dangerous O
situations O

in O
confusing O
places O

for O

in O

in O

that O
there O

to O
contact O
the O
municipal O
works O
immediately O
and O
to O
describe O
the O
concrete O
incident O

" O

Then O
we O
can O
determine O
the O
driver O
concerned O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
roster O

because O
the O

had O
successfully O
steamed O
in O
rapid O
train O

through O
the O
preparatory O
games O
. O

And O
to O
this O
day O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
150 O
members O
believe O
that O
a O
national O
club O
designation O
is O
unnecessary O
, O
as O
the O
Croatian B-MISC
league O
competitor O
Dubrovnik B-ORG
or O
the O
AC B-ORG
Mladost I-ORG
( O
formerly O
Jugo B-ORG
Bornheim I-ORG

have O
done O

This O
changes O
, O
and O
Cucak B-PER
is O
particularly O
sad O
about O
it O
, O
nothing O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
sponsors O
have O
withdrawn O
, O
( O
the O
promised O
promotion O
premium O
could O
therefore O
not O
be O
paid O

had O
to O
be O
dissolved O

therefore O
looks O
forward O
to O
the O
anniversary O
of O
the O
20th O
anniversary O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
association O
planned O
in O
October O
. O
" O

We O
truly O
do O
not O
have O
many O
reasons O
to O
celebrate O

" O

Since O
it O
is O
already O
a O
great O
pleasure O
that O
the O

neither O

not O

Efforts O
to O
find O
a O

own O
have O
so O
far O
failed O
: O

a O
problem O
that O
affects O

, O
a O

" O
It O

right O
now O

where O

that O

about O

Especially O
the O
boys O

have O

he O
said O

A O
total O
of O

besides O

Bernhard B-PER
Mertens I-PER

" O

We O

specifically O
invited O
Schwanheim B-MISC

who O
should O
simply O
come O
into O

with O

" O
, O
continued O
the O
municipal O
politician O

And O
had O
come O
even O
more O
people O
than O

were O
sent O
. O

The O
garden O
area O
was O
full O
with O
about O
200 O
guests O
except O
for O
the O
last O
spot O
, O
one O
listened O
to O
the O

enjoyed O
the O
rich O
buffet O

which O
was O
financed O
according O
to O
Mertens B-PER
" O
almost O
only O
by O
sponsoring O
Schwanheimer B-MISC

. O

Those O
who O
were O
looking O
for O
politicians O
of O
the O
other O
big O
party O
had O
to O
look O
long O
and O
very O
closely O
. O

Only O
Hans B-PER

chairman O
of O
the O
Schwanheimer B-ORG

Ortsverein O
, O
dared O
under O
the O
" O
black O
mass O
" O
. O

However O
, O
he O
did O
not O
act O
shyly O
because O
of O
his O
individual O
position O
. O

He O
excitedly O
chatted O
with O
the O
political O
opponent O

was O
pleased O
about O
the O
close O
relationship O
with O

: O

" O
Meanwhile O
, O
real O
friendships O
have O
developed O
from O
acquaintances O

" O

Since O
the O
turn O
of O
the O

, O
there O
has O
been O
intensive O

between O

supported O
the O

of O
the O
Eastern O

technically O
and O
organizationally O
. O
" O

Sometimes O
after O

we O
went O

reported O
Mertens B-PER

On O
questions O
about O
the O
upcoming O
campaign O
in O
the O
homeland O
Mertens B-PER
was O
rather O
covered O
. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
group O
did O
not O
want O
to O
comment O
on O
individual O
issues O
. O
" O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
Mechterst√§dter B-ORG
CDU I-ORG
will O
somehow O
return O
to O
us O
for O
the O
assistance O
provided O
. O
" O

The O
festive O
mood O
did O
not O
allow O
anyone O
to O
be O
taken O
because O
of O
the O
approaching O
elections O
. O

Also O
not O
Research O
Minister O
Riesenhuber B-PER
. O
" O

In O
recent O
years O
it O
has O
always O
remained O
so O
long O
that O
the O
security O
officials O
became O
really O
murky O
" O
, O
Mertens B-PER

" O

This O
year O
we O
must O
probably O
celebrate O
a O
little O
quieter O
" O
, O
feared O
Michael B-PER
Dietrich I-PER
of O
the O

der O
Rosisten O

" O

After O
last O
summer O

our O
constant O

the O

it O
was O
nevertheless O

From O
Saturday O
afternoon O
to O
late O
Sunday O
evening O
they O
celebrated O
their O
traditional O
summer O
festival O
in O
the O
Ziegelh√ºttenweg B-LOC

" O
The O
festival O
is O
the O
most O
important O
program O
point O
in O
the O
club O
year O
, O
" O
explained O
Michael B-PER
Dietrich I-PER
. O
" O

Through O
the O
revenue O
we O
can O
finance O
necessary O
purchases O
. O
" O

Last O
year O
, O
the O
fixed O
profit O
enabled O
the O
purchase O
of O
a O

the O

" O

In O

the O

fairy O
marks O
something O
like O
a O
turning O
point O
in O
the O
year O
of O
the O
gardener O
. O

The O
spring O
work O
is O
completed O
, O
it O
goes O
on O
the O
harvest O
and O
the O
autumn O
too O
. O
" O

As O
in O
the O
previous O
year O
, O
the O
chairman O
expected O
2000 O
to O
3000 O
guests O
who O
listened O
to O
both O
days O
of O
live O
music O
, O
danced O
under O
the O
open O
sky O
or O
came O
to O
the O
early O

" O
The O
role O
of O
the O
small O
gardener O
has O
changed O
over O
time O
. O

And O
so O
today O
the O
festival O
has O
a O
different O
meaning O
" O
, O
explained O
the O
chairman O
. O

In O
his O
experience O
, O
the O
Rosists O
are O
more O
outwardly O
oriented O
than O
before O
. O
" O

We O
do O
not O
celebrate O
among O
ourselves O
, O
but O
want O
to O
welcome O
as O
many O
new O
faces O
as O
possible O
. O
" O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
the O
gardens O
are O
always O
open O
for O
walks O
even O
for O
outsiders O
. O

If O
you O
are O
so O
fascinated O
by O
the O
relaxing O
green O
that O
he O
even O
wants O
to O
have O
a O

Michael B-PER

disappoint O

Most O

come O
from O
the O

" O

The O
social O
function O
of O
the O

usually O
underestimated O

a O

Some O

would O

shown O
much O
better O
performance O
in O
the O
preliminary O
decisions O
. O

For O
dogs O
such O
a O
competition O
also O
brings O
much O
unknown O
with O
it O
, O
because O
the O
shepherd O
and O
his O
dogs O
do O
not O
know O
the O
herd O
. O

It O
can O
happen O
that O
the O
herd O
gets O
nervous O
and O
suddenly O
drives O
the O
dogs O
. O

This O
did O
not O
happen O
in O
Kirch B-LOC

G√∂ns I-LOC
, O
but O
also O
considerable O
achievements O
were O
demanded O
by O
the O
shepherds O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
a O
herd O
of O
about O
320 O
sheep O
, O
as O
in O
Kirch B-LOC
- I-LOC
G√∂ns I-LOC
, O
runs O
on O

pulls O
itself O
apart O
on O
a O
strekke O
of O
over O
300 O
meters O
and O
must O
be O
kept O
together O
. O

In O
Kirch B-LOC

G√∂ns I-LOC
the O
shepherds O
cursed O
over O
the O
strongly O

prices O
that O

many O

Therefore O

a O

today O

one O

where O

However O
, O
this O
is O
not O

our O
concern O

met O
with O
great O
opposition O
among O
the O
population O
, O
" O
said O
the O
City O
Councillor O
. O

According O
to O
their O
words O
also O
the O
clubs O
have O
to O
expect O
to O
get O
along O
largely O
without O
water O
. O

For O
sports O
such O
as O
hockey O
, O
which O
is O
played O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
almost O
exclusively O
on O
artificial O
turf O
( O
which O
must O
be O
damp O
due O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
injury O
) O
, O
the O
water O
emergency O
without O
exception O
means O
the O
exit O
. O

Similarly O
it O
is O
about O
the O
tennis O
courts O
, O
which O
also O
have O
to O
be O
sprinkled O
with O
the O
valuable O
wet O
to O
be O
playable O
. O

Not O
quite O
as O
hard O
the O

will O
be O
affected O

Hard O
places O
should O
be O
humidified O
every O

and O
then O
, O
otherwise O
the O
dust O
is O
too O
large O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
lawns O
can O
even O
burn O
without O
water O
at O
high O

The O

discussed O

the O

It O
was O
about O
ways O
to O
save O
water O
by O
taking O
short O

or O
collecting O

Another O
suggestion O
was O
to O
use O
the O

by O

also O
the O

which O
had O
nothing O

the O

no O

Finally O
, O
a O

of O
the O

addressed O
an O

problem O

The O
sports O
fields O
and O
the O
functional O
buildings O
with O
showers O
and O
changing O
rooms O
are O
in O
poor O
condition O
( O

) O
. O

However O
, O
the O
SG B-MISC
representative I-MISC
got O
nothing O
new O
to O
hear O
. O

In O
the O
normal O
course O
of O
events O
, O
the O
renewal O
of O
the O
function O
house O
would O
begin O
and O
be O
completed O
in O
1993 O
, O
said O
Ms O
Schenk B-PER
. O

The O
funds O
for O
the O
artificial O
turf O

are O
expected O
to O
be O
allocated O
for O
1994 O

Thus O
, O
the O
SG B-ORG
could O

The O

the O
new O
S O

line O
along O
the O
Tiroler B-LOC
Stra√üe I-LOC
has O
decreased O
significantly O
due O
to O
the O
construction O
of O

barriers O
. O

This O
was O
reported O
recently O
by O
the O

to O
the O

After O

. O

If O
the O
noise O
level O
is O
reduced O
by O
10 O
dB O
( O
A O
) O
, O
this O
corresponds O
to O
a O
halving O
of O
the O
noise O
. O

According O
to O
the O
CDU B-ORG
, O
the O

The O

New O

" O
- O
a O
wisdom O
that O
is O
not O
always O
true O
. O

In O
relation O
to O
the O
renewal O
of O
heating O
systems O
, O
however O
, O
it O
certainly O
applies O
to O
: O

The O
past O
years O
have O
led O
to O
new O
insights O
and O
serious O
improvements O
in O
heating O
technology O
. O

If O
you O
are O
still O
using O
a O
heating O
system O
of O
the O
older O
year O
, O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O
calculate O
by O
an O
expert O
how O
much O
energy O
and O
thus O
money O
you O
can O
save O
with O
a O
new O
, O
contemporary O
system O
. O

If O
the O
boiler O
is O
older O
than O
ten O
years O
, O
it O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
it O
will O
have O
a O
saving O
potential O
of O
more O
than O
20 O
percent O
. O

If O
it O
is O
added O
that O
maintenance O
costs O
for O
a O
new O
plant O
generally O
fall O
significantly O
, O
the O
investment O
pays O
off O
within O
a O
few O
years O
. O

But O
there O
is O
another O
, O
valid O
argument O
: O

On O
30 O
September O
1993 O
the O
transitional O
period O
of O
the O
first O
Federal O
Immission O
Protection O
Regulation O
expires O
. O

From O
that O
date O
at O
the O
latest O
, O
old O
plants O
must O
also O
comply O
with O
the O
new O
, O
significantly O
more O
stringent O
limit O
values O
. O

Lower O
energy O
consumption O
means O
increased O
use O
of O
fuels O
. O

This O
automatically O
decreases O
the O
pollutant O
production O
. O

effect O
that O
can O

it O

it O

this O
: O

Only O
a O
few O

In O

that O
opens O
the O
way O
out O
of O
the O
dilemma O
: O

" O

up O

something O

that O

A O
flash O
of O
mind O
that O

arouses O

The O

" O
said O

, O
" O
people O
should O
keep O
the O

Now O
the O

says O
Sylvia B-PER

contemplatively O
. O

For O
them O
, O
the O
function O
of O
the O
Scouts O
has O
changed O
: O

" O
We O
want O
to O
promote O
group O
life O
, O
practice O
solidarity O
and O
learn O
to O
develop O
understanding O
of O
each O
other O
's O
weaknesses O
. O
" O

The O
children O
should O
learn O
that O
" O
not O
everything O
goes O
after O
their O
booze O
" O
but O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
whole O
group O
must O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
. O

there O

missing O

" O

No O
leaders O
" O
is O
anyway O
the O
main O
problem O
of O
the O
tribe O
, O
because O
not O
all O

could O
be O
included O
in O
the O
groups O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lively O
tribal O
life O
: O

The O
scouts O
even O
have O
their O
own O
garden O
at O
Sachsenh√§user B-LOC
Landwehrweg I-LOC
, O
where O
the O
children O
have O
built O
a O
hut O
and O
where O
they O
can O
grill O
. O

On O
the O
regular O
group O
evenings O
in O
the O
community O
rooms O
the O
children O
consider O
their O
own O
program O
, O
the O
leaders O
should O
only O
support O
them O
. O

The O
highlight O
of O
every O
Scout O
year O
is O
the O
summer O
camp O
: O

This O
year O
, O
the O

wild O
summer O
" O
several O
base O
camps O
had O
been O
set O
up O
, O
each O
meeting O
several O
tribes O
. O

This O
form O
has O
therefore O
been O
chosen O
so O
that O
the O
individual O

can O
also O
get O
to O
know O

Originally O
it O
may O
have O

curiosity O

when O
they O
heard O
that O
Stockhausen B-PER

He O

how O
his O

how O

Some O
of O
the O

were O
well O

What O
would O
be O
to O
consider O
for O
the O
future O
, O
the O
club O

formulated O
: O

" O
The O

could O
be O
shortened O
, O

are O
deserted O

" O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
Kerwegesellschaft O
was O
to O
organize O
a O

for O

because O

The O
Hasek B-PER
would O
probably O
have O
drunk O
himself O

put O
some O

Saudi O

Of O

it O
was O

curious O
when O
the O

A O
controversial O
" O
figure O
" O
of O
scientific O
life O
: O

structuralism O
, O
has O
become O
old O
. O

Historians O
and O
biographers O
swarm O
out O
and O
paint O
their O
gray O
in O
gray O
, O
with O
which O
, O
as O
Hegel B-PER
says O
, O
nothing O
can O
be O
" O
rejuvenated O
" O
, O
but O
only O
something O
" O
recognize O
" O
. O

However O
, O
what O
is O
the O
best O
way O
of O
knowledge O
- O
the O
epopoe O
of O
structuralism O
or O
the O
history O
of O
structuralists O
. O

Mono- O
and O
biographical O
studies O
have O
now O
tracked O
the O
development O
of O
individual O
disciplines O
or O
the O
development O
of O
their O
most O
important O
thinkers O
. O

However O
, O
what O
has O
been O
lacking O
so O
far O
was O
a O
comprehensive O
history O
of O
this O
movement O
, O
which O
in O
France B-LOC
since O
the O
fifties O
has O
captured O
all O
human O
sciences O
and O
revolutionized O
methodically O
. O

However O
, O
such O
global O
access O
is O
subject O
to O
problems O
that O
are O
not O
familiar O
with O
individual O
studies O
. O

Any O
uniform O
, O
continuous O
treatment O
of O
the O
so O
diverse O
phenomenon O
seems O
impossible O
, O
because O
structuralism O
was O
initially O
an O
epoch O
that O
, O
like O
any O
other O
, O
has O
hardly O
any O
precise O
limits O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
would O
be O
to O
consider O
whether O
one O
is O
not O
better O
from O
an O
anthropological O
, O
psychoanalytic O
, O
linguistic O

historical O

also O
decays O

early O

they O
even O

had O
so O
clearly O
distanced O
themselves O

the O

less O

The O
author O
had O
to O
develop O
a O
very O
own O
biographical O
concept O
, O
because O
he O
knew O
exactly O
: O

about O
this O
enigmatic O
and O
fascinating O
figure O
, O
about O
this O
unique O
" O
case O
" O
in O
modern O

history O
can O
not O
write O
a O
" O

" O
biography O

Too O
much O
comes O
together O
here O
. O

Althusser B-PER
was O
apparently O
a O
man O
without O
qualities O
, O
but O
as O
a O
philosophy O
professor O
and O
as O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Communist O
Party O
he O
was O
able O
to O
rise O
to O
an O
intellectual O
myth O
. O

But O
he O
was O
also O
a O
mentally O
ill O
, O
whose O
life O
ended O
in O
a O
tragedy O
. O

His O
biographer O
sees O
his O
task O
in O
confronting O
this O
myth O
with O
the O
biographical O
reality O
to O
destroy O
it O
. O

By O
means O
of O
more O
diverse O
, O
new O
sources O
he O
carefully O
tries O
to O
penetrate O
into O
the O
imaginary O
world O
of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
strangled O
his O
wife O
. O

On O
500 O
pages O
he O
penetrates O
that O
time O
in O
which O
Althusser B-PER
was O
still O
completely O
unknown O
and O
in O
which O
the O
key O
to O
understanding O
the O
mystery O
must O
lie O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Algerian B-MISC
childhood O
, O
which O
has O
been O
thoroughly O
poisoned O
by O
a O
mother O
hostile O
to O
the O
body O
( O
and O
" O
martyr O
" O
) O

she O
loved O
another O
Louis O

Louis B-PER

the O
brilliant O
brother O
of O
her O
husband O
who O
fell O
in O
the O
war O
, O
whom O
she O
was O
supposed O
to O
marry O
! O

Thus O
, O
already O
to O
the O
child O
the O
tormenting O

to O

get O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
current O
situation O

While O

are O
currently O
silent O
in O
South B-LOC
Ossetia I-LOC

the O
situation O
is O
as O

in O
the O

The O
town O
of O
Zchinwali B-LOC
, O
located O
in O
the O
valley O
, O
once O
had O
a O
population O
of O
60,000 O
. O

How O
many O
are O
there O
today O
, O
nobody O
can O
say O

While O
of O
the O
Georgian B-MISC

who O
were O
once O
at O
home O
in O
Zchinwali B-LOC

no O
one O
has O
returned O
, O
more O
and O
more O
Ossetians B-MISC
come O
here O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
come O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
Georgia B-LOC

had O
fled O
from O
there O
to O
North B-LOC

Now O
they O
move O
from O
the O
south O
and O
also O
to O
Zchinwali B-LOC

a O

20 O

At O
first O

, O
Zchinwali B-LOC
looks O
green O
, O
sometimes O

Many O
streets O
are O
characterized O
by O

six O

There O
is O
still O
a O

, O
the O

lasting O
one O

Now O
there O

of O
1990 O
, O
the O
pro O

Supreme O
Soviet B-MISC

South B-LOC
Ossetia I-LOC
declared O
the O

The O

announced O
the O

its O
union O
with O
North B-LOC
Ossetia I-LOC
, O
which O
lies O

The O
Georgian B-MISC
parliament O
, O
declared O
the O

unconstitutional O
, O
abolished O
the O

Since O
then O
, O
the O
events O
in O
South B-LOC

been O

On O

almost O
90 O

In O
many O
Georgians B-MISC

the O

the O

Before O

after O
a O
meeting O
with O

and O
mayors O
from O

The O
chairman O
of O
the O
sub O

district O
expressed O
an O
incomprehension O
about O
the O
attitude O
of O
some O
citizens O
not O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
costs O
of O
improving O
the O
cleaning O
performance O
of O
the O
sewage O

plant O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
number O
of O
inhabitants O
, O
the O
renovation O
and O
modernisation O
of O
a O
sewage O
treatment O
plant O
would O
cost O
between O
10 O
and O
50 O
million O
marks O
per O
municipality O
. O

Although O
the O
country O
is O
paying O
a O
part O
, O
the O
remaining O
amount O
can O
not O
be O
paid O
from O
the O
municipal O
funds O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
it O
is O
secondary O
whether O
the O
necessary O
funds O
are O
collected O
through O
fees O
, O
contributions O
or O
mixed O
financing O
. O

This O
can O
only O

in O

in O
Nauheim B-LOC

In O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
sub O

, O
it O
is O
crucial O
that O

" O
In O
Nauheim B-LOC

CDU B-ORG

The O
BIK B-ORG

The O

been O
largely O

by O

But O

about O
5.7 O

In O

the O

" O

They O

This O
has O
been O
rejected O
by O
the O

as O
wrong O

The O
first O

will O
be O
due O
on O
1 O
September O
1992 O

Inconsistencies O

not O

you O
must O

concluded O
in O

" O
active O

acceptable O

circumstances O

A O

Cornelius B-PER
Versluys I-PER
, O
who O

This O
may O
be O
legally O
reprehensible O

from O

point O

it O
may O
be O
responsible O
in O
some O
cases O

According O

Versluys B-PER

pediatricians O
are O
divided O

the O
question O

the O

In O

According O

the O

about O
300 O

of O
cases O
of O
active O
life O
termination O
in O
newborns O
at O
a O
maximum O
of O
ten O
per O

The O
recommendations O
say O
that O
parents O
should O
be O
able O
to O
find O

for O
their O
child O
with O
a O
doctor O
who O
understands O

Doctors O

could O

euthanasia O

but O
not O
in O

. O

If O
a O
doctor O
is O
not O
willing O
to O
end O
the O
child O
's O
life O
while O
the O
parents O
want O

down O
criteria O

Can O

actively O

the O
life O
of O
a O
severely O
damaged O
baby O
, O
reporting O
it O
to O
the O

However O
, O
it O
regrets O
that O
there O
are O
no O
legal O
rules O
governing O
the O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
judiciary O
regards O
and O
accepts O
active O
ending O
of O
life O
as O
an O
emergency O
. O

The O
working O
group O
finds O
that O
under O
the O
circumstances O
the O
doctor O
himself O
must O
weigh O
whether O
he O
considers O
it O
appropriate O
to O
inform O
the O
prosecutor O
of O
his O
actions O
or O
not O
. O

A O
judicial O
investigation O
, O
it O
is O
said O
, O
could O
cause O
great O
anxiety O
in O
the O

the O

is O
such O
an O

it O

Here O

the O
question O
arises O
whether O
the O
Bosnians B-MISC
want O
the O

withdrawal O

all O

They O
may O
reject O
it O
because O
it O
could O
see O
a O
renunciation O

the O

they O
claimed O
. O

It O
would O
be O
grateful O
if O
you O
would O
report O
on O
it O

The O
Bosnians B-MISC
will O
also O
ask O
who O
feeds O
the O
soldiers O
when O
the O
women O

no O

It O
is O
quite O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
no O
humanitarian O

at O
all O
for O

only O
. O

The O
soldiers O
will O
always O
make O
sure O
that O
there O
is O
something O
left O
for O
them O
, O
probably O
even O
the O
greater O

The O
supply O

constitutes O

It O
is O
hardly O
to O
be O
expected O
that O
the O
Serbs B-MISC
will O
accept O
this O

We O
can O
only O
help O
the O

proposing O
a O

them O

that O

some O

of O
the O

of O

( O

, O
divorces O
have O
been O
comparable O
to O
decisions O
by O
a O
football O

who O
has O
not O
seen O
the O
game O
, O
but O
has O
nevertheless O
decided O
on O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
match O
. O

This O
will O
have O
the O
catastrophic O
consequences O
mentioned O
above O
, O
because O
anyone O
who O
is O
" O
economically O
stronger O
" O
is O
supposed O
to O
spend O
years O
or O
possibly O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O
on O
the O
livelihood O
of O
an O
ex O

or O
ex O

, O
who O
is O
often O
freaking O
out O
. O

In O
order O
to O
relieve O
legislators O
and O
the O
family O
court O
of O
responsibility O
for O
these O
consequences O
, O
the O
mediators O
should O
now O
hold O
. O

But O
if O
before O
, O
even O
before O
a O
couple O
is O
looking O
for O
help O
with O
a O
mediator O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
children O
remain O
independent O
of O
the O
question O
of O
guilt O
with O
the O
mother O
and O
the O
" O
economically O
stronger O
" O
( O
usually O
still O
the O
man O
who O
earns O
more O
or O
more O
alone O
) O
not O
only O
the O
natural O
child O
support O
, O
but O
also O
after O
- O
marital O
support O
to O
an O
exgattin O
possibly O
only O
on O
the O
ego O
trip O
to O
pay O
, O
then O
the O
use O
of O
mediators O
is O
just O
a O
transfer O
of O
responsibility O
from O
the O
family O
court O
to O
the O
mediator O
. O

The O
mediation O
then O
aims O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
chatting O
of O
the O
" O
economically O
stronger O
" O
to O
accept O
the O
often O
ruinous O
consequences O
of O
the O
divorce O
first O
without O
resistance O
and O
thus O
to O
accept O
the O
already O
predetermined O
decision O
on O
custody O
and O
maintenance O
payment O
" O
consensually O
" O
to O
the O
family O
court O
. O

But O
if O
a O
court O
decision O
is O
already O
established O
, O
then O
this O
is O
probably O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
farce O

only O
comparable O

is O

because O
even O
in O

everything O
is O
obviously O
going O
in O

of O
the O

It O
is O

the O
" O

it O

However O
, O
it O
found O
a O
mixed O
response O
in O

because O
it O

many O
political O
considerations O

was O
not O
conclusive O
in O
itself O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
reconcile O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
holding O

acts O
as O
an O
independent O

, O

that O
the O

" O

. O

defend O

in O
the O

Nagorno O

Karabakh B-LOC
, O
fought O
by O
Armenians B-MISC

Azerbaijanis O
, O
as O
the O
father O
says O

" O

When O
the O
friends O
volunteered O
, O
he O
could O
n't O
stand O
as O
a O

But O
the O
Alimovs B-PER

actually O
Russians B-MISC
who O
, O
however O
, O
have O
been O
living O
and O
working O
in O
the O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
capital O
Baku B-LOC
for O
decades O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
May O
, O
Alimov B-PER
had O
learned O
about O
the O
International B-ORG
Red I-ORG
Cross I-ORG
that O
his O
son O
had O
been O
imprisoned O
in O
Armenian B-MISC
war O
two O
weeks O
earlier O
. O

Ever O
since O
this O
message O
arrived O
, O
he O
's O
been O
looking O
for O
him O
. O

Neither O
in O
the O
defence O
nor O
in O
the O
interior B-ORG
ministry I-ORG
does O
anyone O
feel O
responsible O
for O
prisoners O
of O

" O

No O
one O
keeps O
lists O
, O
counts O
the O
injured O
and O
the O
dead O
, O
" O
complains O
the O
father O
. O

But O
the O
53 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
crane O
driver O
did O
not O
give O
up O
. O

He O
packed O
up O
his O
savings O
, O
left O
his O
workplace O
and O
began O
to O
drive O
off O
the O
battalions O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
border O
. O
" O

I O
learned O
a O
lot O
more O
from O
the O
troops O
. O
" O

There O
there O
were O
lists O
of O
the O
injured O
and O
the O
dead O
. O
" O

On O
my O
trip O
on O
the O
lists O
I O
counted O
a O
total O
of O
1700 O
soldiers O
and O
5000 O
civilians O
" O
, O
says O
Alimov B-PER
. O

However O
, O
these O
were O
only O
the O
figures O
of O
the O
Azerbaijanis B-MISC
who O
had O
fallen O
into O
Armenian B-MISC
captivity O
. O

Thanks O
to O
his O
tenacity O
, O
Alimov B-PER
finally O
reached O
Kazakh O
in O
Azerbaijan B-MISC
's I-MISC
border O
town O
that O
his O
son O
was O
planned O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
a O
prisoner O
exchange O
. O
" O

Together O
with O
four O
Azerbaijanis B-MISC
and O
one O
woman O
he O
should O
be O
exchanged O
for O
an O
Armenian B-MISC
officer O
. O
" O

But O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
. O

As O
Alimov B-PER
found O
out O
, O
the O
Armenian B-MISC
officer O
is O
with O
an O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
family O
who O
holds O
him O
captive O
to O
organize O
an O
exchange O
for O
his O
own O
son O
in O
Armenia B-LOC
. O

Since O
this O
in O
turn O
is O
held O
by O
an O
Armenian B-MISC
family O
, O
which O
thereby O
wants O
to O
free O
its O
own O
son O
from O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
captivity O
, O
the O
company O
failed O
. O

" O
Our O
governments O
are O
too O
young O
to O
have O
everything O
under O
control O
, O
" O
explains O
Vladimir B-PER
Airapetjan I-PER
, O
KGB B-MISC
chief I-MISC
in O
the O
Armenian B-MISC
border O
village O
of O
Idshewan B-LOC

Agreements O
between O
the O

not O

" O

runs O
not O
at O

at O

Thus O
, O
the O

the O
Armenian B-MISC
Idevan B-LOC

Kazakh B-LOC
on O
the O
Azerbaijani B-MISC

Villagers O

Between O

occasionally O

in O
a O

That O

the O

" O

These O

" O
is O

In O
many O

, O

would O
also O
be O
done O

When O

one O

musically O

the O

seeks O
the O

finds O
its O

way O

Although O

it O

This O
had O

Claudio B-PER
Abbado I-PER

In O

the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
ideologically O
open O

in O
the O
best O
sense O
of O
the O
word O

delicate O

Shostakovich B-PER

round O

letting O

a O
convincing O
solution O
as O
in O
other O

problems O
. O

Also O
musically O
, O
Gergiew B-PER
goes O
his O
own O
way O
. O

He O
interprets O
the O
music O
unequally O
introverted O
than O
Abbado B-PER
( O
whose O
cuts O
he O
avoids O
) O
, O
bends O
the O
musical O
epic O
into O
a O
often O
chamber O
music O
style O
. O

He O
can O
afford O
to O
renounce O
any O
theatricalism O
because O
his O
choirs O
impress O
with O
a O
fantastic O
fine O
articulation O
. O

Also O
the O
soloist O
ensemble O
, O
renouncing O
every O
loaned O
star B-PER
, O
convinces O
by O
the O
fine O
cut O
of O
its O
access O
. O

The O
renunciation O
of O
spectacular O
effects O
can O
also O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
sound O
technique O
of O
the O

show O
us O
an O
evil O
story O
from O

This O

Carlos B-PER
has O
lived O
through O
the O
four O
stages O
of O
the O
project O
, O
the O
last O
of O
which O
is O
the O
children O

republic O
, O
himself O
once O
. O

The O
first O
stage O
is O
called O
" O
friendship O
" O
. O

Father O
Nicol√≥ B-PER
and O
his O
staff O
go O
to O
the O
children O
, O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
called O
" O
gamines O
" O
, O
on O
the O
street O
to O
make O
friends O
with O
them O
. O

So O
the O
program O
adapts O
to O
the O
world O
of O
street O
children O
and O
not O
vice O
versa O
. O

First O
they O
watch O
the O
children O
. O

After O
the O
first O
contacts O
they O
finally O
start O
playing O
with O
each O
other O
. O

For O
this O
, O
the O
educators O
of O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
have O
learned O
their O
own O
language O
of O
" O
gamines O
" O
, O
which O
they O
speak O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
protect O
themselves O
better O
on O
the O
road O
against O
others O
. O

Afterwards O
they O
invite O
the O
children O
to O
a O
trip O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
, O
south O
of O
Bogot√° B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
children O
relax O
while O
swimming O
and O
playing O
and O
live O
for O
a O
while O
without O
drugs O
. O

About O
90 O
percent O
of O
the O
approximately O
5000 O
street O
children O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
resort O
to O
drugs O
. O

Many O
sniff O
shoe O
glue O
, O
with O
which O
they O
numb O
their O
nerves O
and O
hunger O
. O

Increasingly O
, O
however O
, O
" O
basuco O
" O
is O
also O
taken O
, O
a O
particularly O
dangerous O
mixture O
of O
the O
waste O
product O
of O
the O
coca O

, O
which O
is O
enriched O
with O
chemical O

. O

The O
trip O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
offers O
the O
staff O
of O
Father O
Nicol√≥ B-PER
above O
all O
the O
opportunity O
to O
get O
to O
know O
the O
background O
for O
the O
street O
life O
of O
the O
children O
. O

All O
project O
managers O
agree O
that O
- O
like O
many O
other O
problems O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
- O
the O
" O
gamines O
" O
also O
have O
their O
main O
cause O
in O
the O
social O
distress O
of O
many O
families O
. O

According O
to O
the O
State O
Statistical B-ORG
Office I-ORG
of O
1990 O
, O
38 O
per O
cent O
of O
all O
Colombian B-MISC
households O
did O
not O
have O
sufficient O

for O
their O

Many O
of O
these O
families O
have O
fled O
from O
the O
country O
to O
the O
city O
. O

There O
, O
people O
are O
driven O
by O
a O
lack O
of O
training O
prospects O
and O
medical O
care O
in O
rural O
areas O
, O
but O
also O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
their O

from O
which O
they O
can O
live O
, O
and O
above O
all O
by O
the O
continuing O
" O

( O

, O
which O
still O
prevails O
there O
: O

Although O
the O
attacks O
of O
the O

after O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
military O
arm O
of O
the O
Medell√¨n B-ORG

last O
year O
have O
decreased O
, O
the O
aggressions O
between O
the O
military O

the O

are O
now O
increasing O
again O
after O
unsuccessful O
negotiations O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
guerrilla O
. O

Many O
civilians O
are O
involved O
in O

In O
the O
city O
, O
however O
, O
refugees O
often O
do O
not O
find O
work O
or O
just O
work O
in O
the O
" O
informal O
sector O
" O
, O
so O
they O
are O
without O
regulated O
income O
. O

In O
Bogot√° B-LOC
, O
more O
than O
440 O

workers O
, O
about O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O

, O
earn O
less O
than O
the O

, O
which O
is O
already O
very O
low O
, O
according O
to O
the O
economic O
data O
of O
the O

. O

Therefore O
, O
both O
parents O
often O
have O
to O
work O
. O

The O
children O
either O
stay O
alone O
at O
home O
or O
go O
to O
the O
street O
where O
they O
contribute O
to O
family O
income O
through O
casual O
work O
, O
begging O
or O
stealing O
. O

Often O
they O
then O
join O
the O
street O
children O
and O
break O
off O
contact O
with O
the O
family O
because O
they O
feel O
exploited O
there O
and O
are O
often O
also O
abused O
. O
" O

is O

this O

in O

which O
leads O
to O

About O
three O
- O
quarters O
of O
the O

children O
who O
participate O
in O
the O
trip O
to O
Arvelaez O
, O
then O
regularly O
come O
to O
the O
" O

, O
a O
courtyard O
that O
Father O
Nicol√≥ B-PER
set O
up O
twelve O
years O
ago O
for O
the O
street O
boys O
. O

At O
the O
entrance O

of O
the O

, O
the O
" O

" O
give O
off O
their O

and O
then O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
. O

You O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
wash O
yourself O
, O
to O
play O
football O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
to O
have O
yourself O

For O
eight O
days O
I O
've O
been O
in O
the O
patio O
, O
because O
here O
there O
's O
breakfast O
and O
lunch O
, O
" O
says O
13 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Julian B-PER
. O

He O
also O
became O
street O
boy O
because O
he O
was O
beaten O
by O
his O
parents O
in O
the O
poor O
district O
" O
Santa B-LOC
Librada I-LOC
" O
in O
the O
south O
of O
Bogot√° B-LOC
. O

But O
like O
many O
others O
it O
pulls O
Julian B-PER
back O
to O
the O
street O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
" O
gamines O
" O
have O
become O
accustomed O
to O
the O
" O
free O
life O
" O
there O
. O

This O
will O
of O
freedom O
is O
respected O
by O
the O
employees O
of O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
, O
because O
in O
the O
open O
institution O
one O
wants O
to O
take O
the O
dignity O
of O
the O
children O
seriously O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
second O
stage O
of O
the O
programme O
- O
whose O
term O
" O
freedom O
" O
already O
indicates O
- O
children O
can O
leave O
again O
. O

But O
here O
they O
have O
to O
follow O
very O
specific O
rules O
, O
for O
example O
for O
eating O
and O
sleeping O
, O
and O
have O
discussions O
with O
those O
responsible O
. O

Like O
the O
employees O
of O
the O
project O
in O
the O
first O
approximation O
efforts O
with O
the O
children O
on O
the O
street O
, O
one O
tries O
here O
also O
first O
to O
return O
the O
children O
to O
their O
families O
. O

Because O
" O
the O
best O
institution O
is O
the O
true O
family O
" O
, O
Carlos B-PER
Lara I-PER
as O
well O
as O
Manuel B-PER
Ospina I-PER
is O
convinced O
of O
. O

However O
, O
they O
experience O
that O
the O
children O
usually O
return O
there O
only O
for O
a O
short O
time O
, O
then O
they O
come O
back O
to O
the O
" O
patio O
" O
. O

They O
start O
again O
from O
the O
beginning O
, O
which O
those O
who O
have O
once O
retired O
must O
do O
for O
educational O
reasons O
. O
" O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
a O
child O
leaves O
the O
program O
three O
times O
, O
until O
he O
really O
knows O
this O
" O
, O
Carlos B-PER
points O
out O
once O
again O
that O
the O
" O
gamines O
" O
have O
learned O
to O
appreciate O
freedom O
on O
the O
street O
. O

In O
the O
third O
stage O
, O
which O
is O
called O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
, O
the O
children O
then O
draw O
but O
finally O
a O
conclusion O
under O
their O
past O
. O

As O
a O
symbolic O
gesture O
for O
this O
they O
solemnly O
burn O
their O
rag O
dresses O
. O

Father O
Nicol√≥ B-PER
sees O
this O
stage O
as O
a O
playful O
introduction O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
. O

Now O
the O
children O
regularly O
go O
to O
school O
and O
learn O
handicraft O
activities O
in O
a O
workshop O
and O
in O
ceramic O
courses O
. O

When O
the O
caregivers O
finally O
get O
the O
impression O
that O
a O
child O
has O
matured O
, O
it O
changes O
to O
the O
children O
's O
republic O
" O
La B-LOC
Florida I-LOC
" O
, O
where O
currently O
355 O
teenagers O
live O
, O
study O

while O
the O

of O
the O

located O
in O
a O

Thus O
the O

contributes O
to O
the O

In O
contrast O
to O
the O

in O

Flashback O
: O

On O
Friday O
, O
September O
5 O
, O
1986 O
, O
Landrat O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
and O
his O
deputy O
Pipa B-PER
breathed O
deep O
through O
in O
the O
Schlo√überghalle B-LOC
Nidderau I-LOC
. O

They O
had O
been O
elected O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
Green B-MISC
Group I-MISC
in O
the O
leadership O
positions O
in O
the O
Landratsamt O
. O

The O
previous O
main O
officials O
of O
CDU B-ORG
and O
FDP B-ORG
had O
to O
clear O
their O
armchairs O

Red B-MISC

flower O
dreams O
from O
then O
are O
now O
bursting O
. O

The O
last O
" O
great O
act O
" O
: O

After O
tough O
negotiations O
, O
the O
SPD B-ORG
was O
able O
to O
implement O
the O
1992/93 O
double O
budget O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
last O
year O
. O

Then O
the O
SPD B-ORG
stumbled O
on O
the O
landfill O
question O
into O
a O
voting O
disaster O
in O
the O
Kreistag O
. O

Although O
not O
wanted O
, O
the O
NPD B-ORG
became O
courtable O
as O
a O
brown O
tinge O
at O
the O
scales O
at O
once O
. O

The O
sharper O
gait O
of O
Landrat O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
and O
his O
deputy O
Pipa B-PER
on O
the O
asylum O
issue O
documents O
that O
there O
is O
no O
consensus O
between O
the O
SPD B-ORG
and O
the O
Greens B-ORG
in O
the O
circle O
on O
this O
issue O
either O
. O

While O
the O
two O
main O
officials O
openly O
accuse O
the O
country O
of O
failure O
because O
of O
the O
conditions O
in O
the O

with O

( O
the O
FR B-ORG
reported O
) O
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
find O
it O
" O
bad O
and O
reprehensible O
when O

get O
a O
voice O

. O

That O

are O
sent O
back O
from O
the O
Main B-LOC

is O
not O
an O

case O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
1986 O
, O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
, O
then O
SPD B-MISC
leader I-MISC
in O
the O
Main O
- O
Kinzig B-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
, O
denounced O
that O
the O
CDU B-MISC
- I-MISC
led I-MISC
circle O
had O
refused O
to O
accept O
a O
group O
of O
asylum O
seekers O
. O

In O
a O
current O
hour O
this O
was O
called O
by O
eyerkaufer B-PER
as O
" O
no O
serious O
course O
of O
action O
" O
. O

The O
asylum O
seekers O
had O
" O
been O
found O
to O
be O
beach O
property O
at O
best O
" O
, O
the O
present O
Landrat O
explained O
at O
that O
time O
. O

If O
next O
Friday O
the O
SPD B-ORG
wants O
Erich B-PER
Pipa I-PER
to O
be O
named O
First O
District O
Representative O
again O
in O
that O
same O
Schlo√überghalle B-LOC
, O
it O
needs O
besides O
its O
own O
, O
however O
, O
two O
additional O
votes O
from O
another O
camp O
. O

The O
Greens B-ORG
already O
let O
see O
through O
, O
Pipa B-PER
did O
not O
join O
in O
the O
secret O
vote O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
CDU B-ORG
has O
opposed O
speculation O
that O
there O
would O
be O
" O
submarines O
" O
in O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O

, O
which O
would O
have O
joined O
the O
First O

Pipa B-PER
wants O
to O
be O
elected O
" O
by O
no O
means O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
neo B-MISC
- I-MISC
Nazis I-MISC
" O
according O
to O
his O
own O
statements O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
it O
considers O
it O
necessary O
that O
the O
position O
of O
the O
First O
District O
Administrator O
should O
not O
remain O
vacant O
for O
months O
. O

Pipa B-PER
, O
the O
displeasured O
journalist O
with O
abstractions O
, O
appeals O
to O
the O
Kreistag O
members O
not O
to O
evade O
their O
responsibilities O
. O

So O
he O
already O
expressed O
publicly O
that O
" O
another O
circus O

must O
approach O
if O
I O
am O
not O
re O

elected O
at O
the O
end O
of O
August O
" O
. O

The O
position O
would O
then O
have O
to O
be O
advertised O
immediately O
and O
an O
election O
preparation O
committee O
would O
have O
to O
be O
established O
. O

On O
the O
subject O
of O
re O

, O
the O
five O

still O
covered O
and O
can O
not O
be O

However O
, O
the O
SPD B-ORG
has O
announced O
that O
the O

application O
in O
the O
Kreistag O
will O
only O
be O
made O
if O
it O
is O
previously O
excluded O
that O
Pipa B-PER
can O
only O
remain O
in O
office O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
NPD B-ORG
. O

In O
the O
Kreistag O
, O
however O
, O
not O
only O
the O
topic O
of O
re O

election O
plays O
a O
role O
, O
it O
will O
soon O
also O
be O
about O
the O

Despite O

holders I-MISC
from O
Hanau B-LOC
, O

has O
now O
finally O
put O
the O

in O

of O
the O

and O
decided O
on O
a O

( O
the O

Even O
before O
the O

, O
the O

had O
declared O
that O

At O
the O

was O
even O
praised O
by O
the O
then O
Green B-MISC

as O

In O

According O

Morlock B-PER
's I-PER
thesis O
contradicts O
the O
BUND B-MISC
scientist I-MISC
Rolf B-PER
Neidhardt I-PER
decisively O

Dioxin O
exists O
in O
the O
ecosystem O
only O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
chlorine O
chemistry O
. O

No O
traces O
of O
dioxin O
have O
been O
discovered O
in O
crude O
oil O
, O
coal O
or O
even O
in O
mummified O
, O
centuries O
- O
old O
eskimo O
- O
bleaches O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
scientific O
studies O
in O
wood O
burnings O
would O
only O
have O
revealed O
high O
dioxin O
concentrations O
, O
for O
example O
, O
when O
PVC O
has O
been O
added O
. O

According O
to O
Neidhardt B-PER
, O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O
so O
dramatically O
in O
recent O
years O
that O
the O
Federal O
Government O
considers O
that O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
a O
public O
remedy O
and O
advocates O
the O
closure O
of O
unnecessary O
sources O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
BUND B-ORG
looks O
at O
the O
urban O
crematorium O
and O
opposes O
the O
cremation O
of O
people O
in O
whose O
adipose O
tissue O
dioxin O
is O
deposited O
concentrated O
. O

Although O
Gerhard B-PER
Morlock I-PER
does O
not O
disagree O
with O
the O
view O
that O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O

However O
, O
it O
considers O
the O
installation O
of O
an O
electric O
filter O
in O
the O
plant O
to O
be O
sufficient O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
limit O
value O
. O
" O

I O
think O
the O
little O
exhaust O
gas O
from O
the O
crematorium O
is O
irrelevant O
, O
" O
says O
Morlock B-PER
. O

As O
a O
potentially O
much O
larger O
source O
of O
load O
, O
he O
sees O
the O
" O
huge O
flue O
gas O
quantities O
of O
the O
Staudinger B-LOC
power O
plant O
" O
. O

In O
his O
view O
, O
it O
should O
be O
measured O
there O
. O

Although O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
per O
cubic O
metre O
of O
exhaust O
air O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
measurable O
, O
the O
enormous O
amount O
of O
dioxins O
would O
add O
to O
the O
burden O
. O

Peter B-PER

. O
" O

There O
are O
many O

" O

For O
him O
, O
addiction O
is O
closely O
linked O
to O
the O
character O

the O
personality O

this O
is O
where O
the O

In O

they O
have O
the O

the O
pupils O
, O
to O
steer O
their O
personal O
development O
in O
a O
positive O

. O

The O
children O
must O
learn O
to O
say O
" O
no O
" O
sometimes O
, O

they O
should O
develop O
the O
ability O

real O

, O
only O
a O

is O
built O
, O
which O
leads O
directly O
past O
the O
plant O
site O
of O
Hoechst B-ORG

and O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
Bundesstra√üe O
, O
not O
far O
from O
the O
Kelsterbacher B-LOC
Knott I-LOC
. O

The O
cost O
is O
estimated O
at O
around O
37.5 O
million O
marks O
. O

While O
the O
bridge O
building O
itself O

it O
is O
currently O
impossible O
to O

Even O

Because O
the O
Federation B-ORG

( O
BUND B-ORG

has O
long O

The O

to O

, O
according O

Gabriele B-PER

, O

, O
this O

is O
" O

The O
Kelsterbacher B-LOC
Weg I-LOC
was O
far O
too O

not O

with O
the O

The O

that O
, O

, O
in O
the O

These O

could O
block O
the O

The O
Magistrate O
's O
proposal O
points O
out O
that O
the O

will O
be O
as O

It O
should O
have O
only O
one O

be O
maximum O
seven O

The O

be O

To O

: O

The O

of O
the O

So O
if O
the O

in O

that O

, O
the O
city O
grants O
exemption O
from O
the O

and O
use O
obligation O
" O
. O

This O
means O
an O
indirect O
subsidy O
, O
explains O
the O
mayor O
, O
because O
those O
affected O
then O
do O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
any O
canal O
fees O
for O
the O

In O
addition O
, O
Martin B-PER
is O
not O
quite O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
emergency O
regulation O
. O

Since O
as O
reported O
lawns O
may O
not O
be O
blown O
up O
, O
he O
fears O
great O
damage O
to O
the O
sports O
facilities O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
requested O
a O
derogation O
from O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Government O
. O

The O
sports O
facilities O
are O
now O
designed O
so O
that O
they O
can O
be O

even O
after O

. O

They O
dry O
out O
very O
quickly O
, O
if O
they O
are O
not O
regularly O
rained O
, O
gives O
Martin B-PER
to O
consider O
. O

Therefore O
, O
if O
the O

up O
, O

the O

Meanwhile O

the O

has O
come O
to O
the O
aid O
of O
the O

However O
, O
the O
dry O
matter O
should O
lead O
to O
a O
fundamental O
debate O
on O
the O

the O

does O
not O
consider O
the O

The O
funniest O
one O
will O
probably O
be O
that O
he O
initiated O
the O
persecution O
of O
those O

the O

with O
the O
then O
Attorney O
General O

Then O
he O
should O
have O
at O

whether O

His O
principle O
of O
hope O
, O
which O
he O
addresses O
at O
the O
end O

was O
probably O
rather O
the O
hope O

be O
found O
in O

A O
strange O
niche O

if O
it O

the O
one O
that O

The O
motion O

in O

the O

are O
both O

what O
the O

only O
one O
and O
a O
half O
years O
later O
, O
as O

as O
several O
affidavits O
with O
which O
the O
ground O
for O

it O

there O

However O
, O
this O
was O

Especially O
the O

Forty O

but O
also O
people O
who O
come O
from O

the O

also O
an O
opportunity O
for O

expertly O
competent O
, O
medical O
support O

donations O
in O

drugs O
, O
because O

Tanzanian B-LOC

For O
the O
exhibition O
, O
which O
was O
shown O
last O
week O
at O
the O
Hanau B-LOC
City I-LOC
Hospital I-LOC
, O
Verdonk B-PER
has O
brought O
only O
a O
part O
of O
the O
exhibits O
: O

" O
When O
I O
take O
ghost O
figures O
to O
the O
exhibition O
, O
I O
select O
beforehand O
, O
so O
that O
the O
buyer O
gets O
only O
the O
best O
" O
. O

It O
is O
not O
always O
so O
, O
" O
that O
every O
face O
is O
equally O
beautifully O
carved O
" O
, O
the O
artists O
would O
not O
always O
have O
professional O
tools O
available O
to O
carve O
perfect O
works O
. O

But O
maybe O
it O
is O
also O
what O
constitutes O
the O
art O
of O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
. O

Most O
sculptures O
produce O
the O
macond B-MISC
in O
a O
state O
of O
fear O
. O

Fear O
is O
the O
constant O
companion O
of O
this O
people O
, O
who O
according O
to O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
lives O
in O
a O
completely O
different O
world O
, O
unimaginable O
for O
the O
European B-MISC
. O

For O
her O
, O
a O
dream O
is O
reality O
, O
which O
is O
represented O
in O
her O
works O
: O

" O
When O
the O
macondes B-MISC
dream O
that O
their O
ancestors O
are O
angry O
at O
them O
, O
because O
no O
one O
thinks O
of O
them O
anymore O
, O
they O
get O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
begin O
to O
carve O
the O
contours O
of O
the O
great O
- O
grandmother O
" O
. O

Her O
guilty O
conscience O
is O
so O
often O
the O
starting O
point O
of O
the O
work O
. O

The O
Makonde B-MISC
also O
feel O
constantly O
surrounded O
by O
demons O
, O
in O
the O
Swahili B-MISC
language I-MISC
" O
Shetani O
" O
. O

Of O
the O
" O
Shetani O
" O
there O
is O
a O
rich O
variety O
. O

They O
are O
mostly O
mixed O
beings O
of O
man O
and O
animal O
, O
which O
are O
ferocious O
, O
rogue O
drift O
and O
hide O
. O

But O
not O
all O
spirits O
think O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
are O
dangerous O

" O
The O
good O
spirits O
can O
be O
recognized O
by O
the O
gentle O
and O
great O
eye O
" O
, O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
knows O
. O

The O
sculptors O
also O
deal O
with O
eroticism O
. O

This O
element O
is O
often O
hidden O
under O
symbols O
, O
but O
sometimes O
also O
clearly O
visible O
. O

Sexuality O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
a O
world O
of O
religion O
and O
magic O
, O
connecting O
power O
and O
means O
of O
integration O
. O

The O
fertility O
of O
women O
stands O
for O
the O
macond B-MISC
synonymous O
with O
life O
, O
as O
the O
power O
given O
by O
the O
Creator O
. O

This O
gives O
sexuality O
a O
sacramental O
character O
, O
whereby O
the O
sex O
organs O
almost O
always O
become O
the O
object O
of O
worship O
. O

Another O
motive O
of O
great O
importance O
is O
the O
Tree O
of O
Life O
, O
which O
is O
to O
represent O
" O
the O
connectedness O
of O
all O
humanity O
" O
. O
" O

They O
do O
n't O
live O
as O
we O
do O
in O
Europe B-LOC
as O
an O
individual O
, O
they O
live O
as O
a O
unity O
that O
they O
want O
to O
represent O
artistically O
in O
the O
Tree O
of O
Life O
" O
, O
Verdonk B-PER
explains O
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
natural O
people O
. O

That O
is O
why O
he O
could O
never O
answer O
the O
question O
of O
visitors O
to O
the O
exhibition O
as O
the O
respective O
artist O
was O
called O
. O
" O

Since O
no O
one O
signs O
his O
work O
, O
as O
with O
us O
, O
where O
the O
name O
is O
often O
more O
important O
, O
than O
the O
actual O
work O
of O
art O
" O
. O

The O
exhibits O
shown O
in O
Hanau B-LOC
convey O
something O
uncanny O
, O
they O
express O
what O
the O
macond B-MISC
may O
have O
felt O
in O
the O
production O
. O

The O
magical O
world O
from O
which O
they O
come O
is O
ubiquitous O
, O
is O
even O
able O
to O
instill O
fear O
into O

The O
exhibition O
is O
still O
open O
until O

Finally O
, O
the O
waste O
statute O
states O
that O
the O

Therefore O
he O
demanded O
a O

asked O

If O

The O
question O

she O
asked O
herself O
only O
once O

in O

answered O
equally O
. O

" O
I O
wondered O
if O
I O
committed O
a O
betrayal O

But O
then O
I O
realized O
what O
it O

" O
said O
Annie B-PER

" O
I O
'll O
never O

the O

Many O

from O

tempting O

So O
far O
the O
theory O

In O
practice O
, O
however O
, O
it O
happens O
every O
now O

then O
that O
the O

The O

: O

If O

which O
the O

In O
the O
specific O
case O
, O
according O
to O
the O
contents O
of O

We O

The O
question O

the O

raised O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Can O

This O
was O
not O
always O
the O
case O

however O
. O
Until O
1967 O
the O

was O
only O
half O
- O
a O
pure O

emerged O
from O

And O
in O
this O

only O

for O
25 O

For O
Heinz B-PER
Schlosser I-PER
, O
the O
once O
patriarchal O
painting O
has O
historical O
reasons O
. O

The O
years O
after O
the O
First B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
were O
bleak O
and O
turbulent O
, O
causing O
many O
young O
people O
need O
and O
hopelessness O
. O

They O
longed O
for O
a O
stop O
. O

And O
the O
Kaplan O
tried O
to O
give O
Georg B-PER
Pistor I-PER
: O

On O
August O
14 O
, O
1922 O
, O
he O
founded O
the O
Catholic O
Society O
of O
Society O

The O
objectives O
: O

Training O
and O
sport O
, O
active O
help O
and O
socializing O
. O

These O
tasks O
have O
changed O
little O
even O
in O
the O
seven O
decades O
of O
existence O
, O
although O
the O
society O
of O
journeymen O
has O
only O
been O
a O
real O
family O
since O
the O
mid-60s O
. O
" O

Our O
focus O
is O
on O
educational O
work O
" O
, O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
and O
refers O
to O
a O
rich O
range O
of O
lectures O
and O
seminars O
. O

And O
there O
the O
Hochheimer B-MISC
let O
themselves O
be O
little O
prescribed O
. O
" O

Topics O
that O
concern O
Rome B-LOC
, O
which O
are O
not O
announced O
with O
us O
. O
" O

Members O
do O
what O
seems O
important O
to O
them O
. O
" O

We O
are O
asking O
for O
all O
socio O
- O
political O
commitment O
. O
" O

And O
this O
also O
means O
, O
of O
course O
, O
to O
deal O
with O
critical O
and O
current O
questions O
- O
such O
as O
paragraph O
218 O
. O
May O
the O
church O
leaders O
also O
dogmatically O
stubborn O
help O
for O
fellow O
human O
beings O
: O

not O
only O
be O
far O
from O
home O
, O
in O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
goes O
it O
's O
open O
to O
: O

" O
With O
us O
all O
opinions O
are O
represented O
" O
, O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
. O

Spoken O
about O
everything O
. O
" O

We O
work O
freely O
, O
are O
under O
no O
pressure O
from O
the O
parishes O
nor O
from O
other O
places O
. O
" O

Can O
Schlosser B-PER
imagine O
a O
discussion O
with O
the O
church O
critic O
Eugen B-PER
Drewermann I-PER
? O
" O

Why O
not O
? O
" O

The O
interest O
, O
especially O
among O
young O
people O
, O
would O
certainly O
be O
there O
. O

But O
if O
Drewermann B-PER
would O
come O
to O
a O
place O
like O
Hochheim B-LOC
, O
asks O
Schlosser B-PER
. O

The O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
has O
also O
critically O
illuminated O
another O
topic O
: O

500 O
years O
after O
Columbus B-PER
. O

The O
anniversary O
was O
little O
reason O
for O
the O
members O
to O
celebrate O
, O
but O
rather O
reason O
for O
reflection O
. O

Finally O
, O
in O
many O
countries O
, O
they O
help O
to O
alleviate O
the O
consequences O
of O
exploitation O
: O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Brazil B-LOC
, O
where O
a O
project O
is O
intended O
to O
stop O
people O
fleeing O
land O
, O
or O
in O
Nigeria B-LOC
during O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
well O
and O
a O
vocational O
training O
centre O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
only O
far O
from O
home O
that O
we O
need O
to O
do O
something O
for O
our O
fellow O
human O
beings O
. O

It O
is O
precisely O
the O
immigrants O
who O
need O
support O
in O
integrating O
them O
into O
society O
. O

Tips O
on O
tenant O
protection O
, O
social O
law O
and O
other O
everyday O
issues O
are O
necessary O
. O

Schlosser B-PER
's I-PER
example O
: O

" O
The O
insurance O
representatives O
are O
running O
into O
people O
's O
front O
door O
; O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
're O
signing O
. O
" O

So O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
is O
also O
trying O
in O
consumer O
advice O
. O

Such O
engagement O
costs O
not O
only O
time O
, O
but O
also O
money O
. O
" O

We O
just O
have O
to O
do O
a O
lot O
" O
, O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
calls O
as O
a O
source O
of O
finance O
the O
social O
part O
of O
family O
life O
: O

Seven O
events O
to O
carnival O
and O
the O
stand O
at O
the O
wine O
festival O
must O
drop O
enough O
to O
get O
over O
the O
rounds O
. O

And O
of O
course O
, O
donations O
are O
collected O
again O
and O
again O
- O
even O
at O
the O
birthday O
celebration O
for O
the O
70th O
anniversary O
on O
Sunday O
, O
August O
30 O
, O
10.30 O
a.m. O
, O
in O
the O
church O
of O
Peter B-PER
and O
Paul B-PER
. O

The O
money O
is O
to O
go O
to O
Peter B-PER
Osuchukwu I-PER

The O
pastor O
from O
Nigeria B-LOC
wants O
to O
finance O
projects O
in O
his O
native O
community O
. O

But O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
seems O
to O
make O
little O
impression O
on O
young O
people O
. O
" O

We O
're O
doing O
it O
like O
everyone O
else O
, O
" O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
pointing O
to O
declining O
numbers O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
offered O
to O
young O
people O
- O
the O
regular O
meetings O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
educational O
leave O
, O
the O
aim O
of O
which O
the O
group O
itself O
chooses O
. O
" O

Well O
" O
, O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
" O
for O
the O
future O
I O
wish O
that O
the O
young O
people O
will O
participate O
more O

Because O
only O
in O
this O
way O
can O
they O
help O
shape O
society O
, O
through O
engagement O
in O
associations O
, O
parties O
or O
in O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
