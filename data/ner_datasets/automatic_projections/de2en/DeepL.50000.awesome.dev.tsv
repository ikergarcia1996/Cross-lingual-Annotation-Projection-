It O

A O

But O
how O
high O
or O
how O

The O
Dutch B-MISC
organization O
Milieu B-ORG

assumes O
an O
equal O
" O
environmental O
space O
" O
for O
every O
human O
being O
, O
which O
may O
be O
used O
and O
polluted O
. O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
this O
global O
principle O
of O
equality O
, O
it O
calculates O
that O
the O
citizens O
of O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
overuse O
their O
water O
allowance O
by O
32 O
percent O
, O
energy O
consumption O
, O

, O
and O
meat O
and O
aluminum O
consumption O
by O
60 O
to O
80 O
percent O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
believes O
that O
in O
many O
areas O
of O
everyday O
consumption O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
achieve O
a O
" O
sustainable O
" O
level O
of O
consumption O
simply O
by O
optimizing O
the O
consumption O
of O
raw O
materials O
and O
economizing O
in O
the O
production O
process O
, O
through O
better O

Renunciation O
and O
loss O
of O

The O
situation O
is O
different O
in O
the O
three O
areas O
of O
consumption O
: O
car O
traffic O
, O
air O
transport O
and O
meat O
consumption O
: O

There O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
carrying O
capacity O
of O
the O
earth O
are O
exceeded O
so O
far O
that O
drastic O

unavoidable O

According O
to O
the O
Wuppertal B-ORG
Institute I-ORG
for I-ORG
Climate I-ORG
, O
Environment O
and O
Energy O
, O
a O
change O
of O
values O
is O
necessary O
: O

The O
" O
sacred O
cow O
" O
of O
Western O
culture O
, O
that O
an O
infinite O
growth O
of O
consumption O
is O
possible O
despite O
finite O
resources O
, O
must O
be O
slaughtered O
. O

The O
Environment O
Institute O
therefore O
wants O
to O
develop O
a O
" O
new O
model O
of O
prosperity O
" O
in O
which O
values O
such O
as O
" O
mobility O
" O
and O
" O
freedom O
" O
are O
redefined O
and O
" O
asceticism O
" O
is O
given O
a O
positive O
meaning O
. O

Milieu B-ORG
Defensie I-ORG
assumes O
that O
it O
is O
a O
politically O
difficult O
and O
protracted O
task O
to O
persuade O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
population O
to O
reduce O
their O
consumption O
demands O
. O

The O
question O
is O
how O
the O
acceptance O
of O
a O
different O
idea O
of O
the O
" O
good O
life O
" O
can O
be O
achieved O
in O
small O
steps O
. O

At O
present O
, O
consumer O
organizations O
are O
the O
main O
catalysts O
for O
a O
greening O
of O
consumer O
behavior O
. O

They O
rely O
on O
the O
power O
of O
the O
consumer O
, O
which O
can O
be O
exercised O
with O
the O
shopping O
basket O
, O
but O
also O
by O
abstaining O
from O
buying O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
the O
information O
policy O
of O
the O
traditional O
consumer O
associations O
, O
which O
aims O
only O
at O
price O
and O
quality O
transparency O
of O
products O
, O
they O
are O
concerned O
with O
the O
consequences O
of O
purchase O
and O
consumption O
, O
in O
critical O
cases O
they O
also O
plead O
for O
boycott O
. O

The O
first O
step O
was O
to O
make O
environmental O
compatibility O
a O
criterion O
for O
purchase O
. O

The O
consumer O
movement O
in O
the O
USA B-LOC
included O
ecological O
standards O

its O
list O
of O
criteria O

Under O

it O
was O
about O

. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
public O

The O

is O
that O

When O
Nippon B-LOC

Finance O
Minister O
Tsutomu B-PER
Hata I-PER
unveiled O
his O
" O
emergency O
package O
" O
on O

, O
most O

just O
smiled O
mildly O
. O
" O

Yet O
another O

that O
only O
treats O
the O
symptoms O
of O
stock O
market O
weakness O
, O
but O
not O
the O
disease O
of O
the O

" O
, O
they O
said O
. O

But O
the O
price O
explosion O
of O
the O
past O
week O
left O
many O
critics O
speechless O
. O

It O
is O
certainly O
too O
early O
to O
see O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
capital O
market O
already O
off O
the O
hook O
. O

Two O
preconditions O
for O
this O
are O
indispensable O
: O

Corporate O
profits O
must O
not O
fall O
any O
further O
, O
and O
financial O
institutions O
must O
find O
a O
workable O
solution O
to O
manage O
their O
non O
- O
performing O
loans O
. O

On O
both O
points O
there O
is O
still O
considerable O
doubt O
. O

Surveys O
clearly O
show O
that O
industry O
will O
have O
to O
revise O
its O
earnings O
expectations O
for O
the O
current O
year O
further O
downwards O
, O
after O
having O
already O
suffered O
terrible O
losses O
in O
1991 O
. O

Especially O
the O
electronics O
companies O
, O
which O
are O
used O
to O
success O
, O
fear O
further O
slumps O
. O

The O
Japanese B-MISC
metal O
industry O
is O
suffering O
even O
more O
. O

Nippon B-ORG
Steel I-ORG
, O
for O
example O
, O
is O
expecting O
a O
60 O
percent O
drop O
in O
profits O
. O

As O
long O
as O
no O
one O
knows O
whether O
this O
really O
means O
the O
bottom O
has O
been O
reached O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
hope O
will O
prevail O
. O

Tokyo B-LOC
obviously O
no O
longer O
wants O
to O
rely O
on O
this O
alone O
. O

In O
view O
of O
the O
depressed O
mood O
, O
it O
was O
not O
difficult O
for O
Finance O
Minister O
Hata B-PER
to O
talk O
his O
colleagues O
into O
an O
expensive O
twelve O
- O
point O
aid O
program O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
to O
do O
is O
to O
restore O
confidence O
in O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
banking O
system O
, O
is O
his O
justification O
for O
the O
official O
generosity O
. O

The O
government O
suggests O
that O
banks O
, O
insurance O
companies O
and O
real O
estate O
companies O
should O
form O
a O
joint O
real O
estate O
fund O
with O
government O
assistance O
. O

With O
the O
money O
from O
it O
the O
purchase O
of O
those O
properties O
could O
be O
financed O
, O
which O
are O
now O
practically O
hanging O
in O
the O
air O
as O
collateral O
for O
bank O
loans O
. O

One O
speaks O
of O
a O
necessary O
minimum O
sum O
of O
35 O
billion O
Marks O
. O

How O
the O
Monopoly B-MISC
play I-MISC
is O
to O
run O
off O
, O
remains O
first O
times O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

However O
, O
one O
thing O
is O
already O
clear O
today O
. O

In O
view O
of O
the O
high O
- O
pushed O
real O
estate O
market O
and O
the O
empty O
cashes O
of O
institutional O
investors O
nevertheless O
only O
the O
state O
comes O
as O
potential O
property O
buyers O
into O
consideration O
. O

The O
taxpayer O
is O
condemned O
to O
pay O
the O
bill O
for O
the O
unprecedented O
land O
speculation O
of O
the O
80s O
. O

But O
that O
's O
not O
enough O
generosity O
. O

The O
stock O
market O
shock O
moved O
Nippon B-LOC
's I-LOC
nervous O
government O
to O
further O
concessions O
. O

Thus O
the O
banks O
are O
allowed O
to O
fudge O
their O
balance O
sheets O
in O
a O
manner O
approved O
by O
the O
state O
. O

With O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Finance O
, O
the O
write O
- O
off O
of O
their O
stock O
losses O
will O
be O
postponed O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
current O
fiscal O
year O
on O
March O
31 O
, O
1993 O
, O
and O
will O
thus O
disappear O
from O
the O
books O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
institutions O
will O
be O
allowed O
to O
lend O
money O
to O
their O
clientele O
at O
interest O
rates O
below O
the O
discount O
rate O
of O
currently O
3.25 O
percent O
. O

The O
government O
is O
also O
supporting O
this O
subversion O
of O
monetary O
policy O
by O
waiving O
taxes O
. O

Tokyo B-LOC

the O

Then O
he O
can O
either O
apply O

be O
allowed O
to O
become O
secretary O

again O
( O
which O
would O
force O
the O
red B-MISC

to O
make O
a O
decision O
) O
. O

Because O
he O
already O
works O
in O
Bonn B-LOC

this O
is O
not O
very O
likely O
. O

Or O
he O
applies O
for O
the O
dismissal O
itself O
, O
with O
which O
he O
would O
have O
pension O

only O
in O
the O

75 O

for O
immediately O
would O
fall O
away O

But O
even O
that O
is O

In O

it O
is O
( O

factually O
not O
at O
all O
about O

only O
about O

There O

and O
thus O
had O
even O

still O
current O
pension O

from O
funds O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
of I-LOC

which O
is O
why O
he O
received O
correspondingly O
less O

: O

truly O

He O
has O
" O
earned O

( O

a O
high O
pension O
entitlement O
in O
any O
case O
, O
and O
it O
is O
already O
more O
than O
60 O
percent O
of O
his O
last O
active O
salary O
. O

After O
a O
change O
in O
the O
law O
in O
Bonn B-MISC
, O
which O
came O
into O
force O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O

, O
he O
will O
probably O
also O
have O
to O
have O
his O
income O
credited O
against O
such O
pension O
entitlements O
under O
the O
dual O

A O

the O
Balts B-LOC
returned O
to O

community O

carried O
by O
a O

which O
was O
based O
not O
only O
on O
compassion O
for O
oppressed O
small O
states O
, O
but O
above O
all O
on O
a O
guilty O
conscience O
: O

A O
bad O
conscience O
because O
the O
West B-LOC
had O
suppressed O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
republics O
annexed O
by O
Stalin O
from O
its O
memory O
for O
fifty O
years O
; O
but O
also O
a O
bad O
conscience O
because O
in O
1991 O
it O
still O
ignored O
the O
pleas O
of O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
states O
for O
recognition O
of O
their O
independence O
and O
unilaterally O
bet O
on O
the O
Gorbachev B-PER
card O
until O
the O
coup O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
created O
new O
realities O
. O

Then O
, O
of O
course O
, O
everything O
happened O
very O
quickly O

While O
the O
self O
- O
proclaimed O

in O
Moscow B-LOC
was O
still O
clinging O
to O
power O
, O
Latvia B-LOC

Estonia B-LOC
announced O
their O

- O
Lithuania B-LOC
had O
already O
taken O
this O
step O

February O

and O
two O
weeks O
later O
the O
whole O
world O
had O
recognized O
the O
return O
of O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
states O
. O

Even O
the O
Soviet B-MISC
leadership I-MISC
, O
which O
still O
existed O
but O
had O
been O
deprived O
of O
its O
power O
in O
real O
terms O
, O
no O
longer O
opposed O
the O
desire O
for O
freedom O
. O

But O
the O
expectations O
that O
people O
from O
Vilnius B-LOC

Tallinn B-LOC
, O
from O
Memel B-LOC
to O
Narva B-LOC
placed O
in O
the O
national O
rebirth O
have O
not O
been O
fulfilled O
. O

It O
is O
easier O
to O
achieve O
political O
independence O
than O
to O
disentangle O
economic O
dependencies O
. O

The O
laborious O
introduction O
of O
the O
market O
economy O
has O
also O
brought O
few O
winners O
and O
many O
losers O
in O
the O
Baltic B-LOC

for O
the O
time O
being O
, O
and O
means O
unaffordable O
prices O
and O
declining O
living O
standards O
for O
most O
. O

Hopes O
for O
massive O
aid O
from O
and O
lively O
trade O
exchange O
with O
the O
West B-LOC
have O
remained O
unfulfilled O
. O

The O
sympathy O
bonus O
that O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
states O
enjoyed O
a O
year O
ago O
has O
largely O
evaporated O
. O

Now O
they O
are O
only O
three O
of O
many O
new O
states O
crying O
out O
for O
help O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
relations O
with O
the O
great O
Russian B-MISC
neighbor O
are O
deteriorating O
. O

The O
times O
are O
over O
when O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
democrats O
was O
also O
that O
of O
Boris B-PER
Yeltsin I-PER
. O

Now O
the O
Balts B-LOC
face O
Russian B-MISC
economic O
reprisals O
and O
accusations O
of O
discriminating O
against O
the O
Russian B-MISC
minorities O
living O
in O
the O
Baltic O
States O
. O

The O
once O
Soviet B-MISC
and O
now O
Russian B-MISC
army O
still O
sits O
in O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
garrisons O
and O
thus O
remains O
a O
threat O
to O
independence O
in O
case O
of O
a O
new O
reactionary O
coup O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
. O

And O
the O
Baltic O
states B-LOC
have O
to O
do O
without O
the O
backing O
of O
the O
West I-LOC
, O
because O
the O
West O
is O
now O
relying O
on O
Yeltsin B-PER
as O
it O
once O
did O
on O
Gorbachev O
and O
does O
not O
want O
to O
make O
things O
unpleasant O
for O
the O
Russian B-MISC
president O
. O

Thus O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
states O
feel O
abandoned O
one O
year O
after O
their O
victory O
in O
the O
fight O
for O
freedom O
. O

Instead O
of O
help O
to O
build O
a O
democracy O
according O
to O
the O
western B-MISC
model O
, O
there O
is O
blame O
when O
they O
violate O
democratic O
value O
norms O
: O

because O
of O
their O
minority O
policy O
, O
because O
of O
the O
adherence O
to O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
because O
of O
the O
rehabilitation O
of O
Nazi B-MISC
criminals I-MISC
. O

The O
reproaches O
are O
justified O
. O

But O
the O
yardstick O
with O
which O
the O
Balts B-LOC
are O
measured O
does O
not O
fit O
peoples O
who O
were O
oppressed O
for O
half O
a O
century O
and O
even O
before O
that O
had O
only O
rudimentarily O
got O
to O
know O
democracy O
. O

A O
little O
more O
patience O
and O
understanding O
would O
be O
required O
. O

After O
50 O
years O
of O
foreign O
rule O
the O
Balts B-LOC
now O
want O
to O
be O
masters O
in O
their O
own O
house O
. O

Is O
that O
so O
difficult O
to O
understand O
? O

After O
they O
had O
to O
communicate O
with O
the O
authorities O
in O
their O
own O
country O
in O
a O
foreign O
language O
, O
they O
now O
demand O
that O
everyone O
who O
holds O
a O
public O
office O
understands O
their O
language O
. O

Is O
this O
unreasonable O
? O

The O
harshly O
criticized O
Estonian O
Citizenship O
Act O
, O
which O
requires O
two O
years O
minimum O
residence O
and O
certain O
language O
skills O
, O
is O
not O
discriminatory O
but O
extremely O
liberal O
: O

It O
is O
much O
easier O
for O
non B-MISC

Estonians I-MISC

than O
it O
is O
to O

It O
is O

that O

While O

I O
welcomed O
the O
installation O
of O
Taraki B-LOC

Soviet B-MISC
support O
- O
I O
must O
confess O

still O
reservedly O

as O
a O
chance O

a O
secularizing O

" O

I O
was O
bitter O
about O
the O

at O
Christmas O
1978 O

I O
felt O
that O

totally O
alien O

with O
which O
there O
is O
no O
identification O
whatsoever O

a O
culture O

The O

When O
in O
the O

after O

welcomed O
fall O

it O
became O
clear O
what O
to O
think O
of O
an O
" O
Islamic B-MISC
state O
" O
, O
it O
was O
to O
be O
feared O
that O
this O
could O
also O
threaten O
Afghanistan B-LOC

of O

That O
is O
, O
on O
the O
one O

the O
few O

would O

a O
calm O

impossible O

Although O
this O

has O

been O

but O
must O
now O
emerge O
from O

You O
have O
described O

this O

It O
is O
unfortunately O

that O

creates O
infinitely O
more O
problems O
than O
its O
creators O
hope O

and O
ultimately O
destroys O
those O

can O
rely O

I O

That O
would O
contradict O
all O
principles O

. O

There O
may O
be O
top O
earners O
at O
Lufthansa B-ORG

resulting O

There O
one O
can O
imagine O
restrictions O

the O
majority O
of O
the O
employees O
must O
count O
with O
rising O
living O
costs O
also O
with O
the O
mark O
. O

If O
there O
is O
then O
even O
less O
money O
, O
existential O
worries O
and O
hardships O
arise O
, O
which O
are O
anything O
but O
performance O
- O
stimulating O
. O

This O
is O
disastrous O
for O
a O
service O
enterprise O
, O
which O
lives O
from O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
coworkers O
for O
the O
customer O
. O

It O
is O
to O
be O
asked O
anyway O
whether O
the O
everywhere O
to O
be O
heard O
ringing O
of O
the O
death O
bells O
for O
Lufthansa B-ORG
is O
not O
already O
demotivating O
. O

As O
a O
passenger O
, O
however O
, O
I O
am O
interested O
in O
being O
optimally O
advised O
by O
the O
ground O
staff O
right O
from O
the O
start O
and O
in O
being O
able O
to O
enjoy O
good O
service O
during O
the O
flight O
. O

This O
is O
only O
guaranteed O
by O
motivated O
, O
competent O
and O
open O
- O
minded O
employees O
. O

Wage O
cuts O
and O
worse O
working O
conditions O
have O
never O
contributed O
to O
this O
. O

But O
if O
the O
offer O
is O
no O
longer O
attractive O
, O
the O
customer O
goes O
to O
the O
competition O
, O
which O
offers O
these O
conditions O
. O

The O
resulting O
economic O
damage O
would O
probably O
be O
greater O
than O
the O
expected O
500 O
million O
marks O
relief O
per O
year O
. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
hoped O
that O
the O
workforce O
, O
or O
better O
the O
entire O
membership O
and O
the O
public O
, O
will O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
the O
union O
leadership O
that O
such O
proposals O
are O
useless O
. O

Thus O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
employees O
are O
carried O
to O
the O
grave O
and O
the O
hoped O
- O
for O
effect O
of O
saving O
an O

is O
not O

Not O

Bond O

For O
the O
time O

, O
there O
are O
two O
main O
reasons O
for O
the O
dollar O

decline O
: O

The O
weak O
U.S. B-MISC
economy I-MISC
and O
the O
high O
interest O
rate O
differential O
with O
Germany B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
the O
trigger O
for O
the O
recent O
fall O
in O
prices O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
markets O
' O
distrust O
in O
the O
economic O
policy O
of O
the O
Bush B-MISC
administration I-MISC
and O
the O
vague O
economic O
policy O
formulations O
of O
the O
Democratic O
candidate O
Bill B-PER
Clinton I-PER
. O

In O
his O
speech O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Republican O
Party O
Convention O
in O
Houston O
( O
Texas O
) O
, O
which O
was O
eagerly O
awaited O
by O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
President O
Bush B-PER
announced O
that O
if O
he O
is O
re O
- O
elected O
he O
will O
propose O
tax O
cuts O
on O
condition O
that O
they O
are O
paid O
for O
by O
targeted O
spending O
cuts O
. O

Despite O
this O
condition O
, O
this O
immediately O
triggered O
warning O
signals O
in O
the O
financial O
markets O
, O
fearing O
a O
widening O
of O
the O
budget O
deficit O
. O

Until O
now O
, O
the O
long O
stock O
market O
boom O
in O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
had O
lived O
mainly O
on O
the O
army O
of O
small O
investors O
who O
switched O
to O
stocks O
because O
of O
the O
low O
interest O
rates O
on O
their O
savings O
. O

The O
main O
beneficiaries O
of O
this O
policy O
have O
been O
the O
banks O
, O
which O
can O
clean O
up O
their O
battered O
balance O
sheets O
with O
the O
steep O
difference O
between O
debit O
and O
credit O
interest O
. O

Many O
financial O
institutions O
had O
speculated O
in O
the O
real O
estate O
business O
during O
the O
Reagan B-MISC
years I-MISC
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
low O
interest O
rates O
are O
increasingly O
proving O
to O
be O
a O
blunt O
weapon O
against O
the O
continuing O
economic O
weakness O
. O

The O
beneficiary O
of O
low O
interest O
rates O
is O
also O
the O
government O
itself O
, O
whose O
debt O
service O
is O
thus O
decreasing O
. O

After O
all O

the O
third O

But O
what O
was O
it O
actually O
about O

Originally O
it O
was O
about O
the O
allegation O

for O
reasons O
of O

Werner B-PER
Münch I-PER
( O

, O
who O

also O
picked O
up O
the O
allegation O
and O
thereupon O
got O
a O
visit O
from O
Rauls B-PER

All O
this O
had O
preceded O
when O
Schaper B-PER
wrote O
down O
his O
notes O
in O
the O

In O
the O

of O

Schaper B-PER

to O

This O
person O

who O
had O

knew O

" O

I O
have O
encouraged O

Schaper B-PER
wrote O
further O

" O

My O
question O
whether O
possibly O
. O

Minister O
Rauls B-PER
was O
one O
of O
those O
concerned O
, O
was O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
by O
Quelle O

" O

In O
the O
second O
note O
, O
Schaper B-PER
informed O
that O
he O
had O
visited O
" O
Quelle O
" O
again O
in O
Hanover B-LOC

learned O
that O
the O
other O
member O
of O
the O
government O
was O
possibly O
not O
a O
minister O
, O
but O
a O
state O
secretary O
. O

Matschke B-PER
had O
informed O
" O
Quelle O
" O
that O
further O
incriminated O
persons O
were O
active O
in O
leading O
positions O
in O
the O

the O

governments O

The O
main O
topic O
of O
both O
notes O
, O
however O
, O
were O
Matschke B-PER

compensation O
claims O
against O
the O
state B-LOC
of I-LOC

- O
Anhalt O
, O
which O
had O
employed O
him O
only O
briefly O
as O
a O
" O
security O
officer O
" O
. O

Schaper B-PER
wrote O
: O

" O

estimates O
Mr. O
Matschke B-PER
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
he O

satisfied O
in O
an O

manner O

would O
not O
pass O
on O
any O

" O

" O
Matschke B-PER
is O
not O
interested O
in O
burdening O
this O
very O
government O
with O
negative O
information O
. O

That O
does O
not O
permit O
its O
political O
point O
of O
view O
" O
, O
Schaper B-PER
quoted O
the O
interlocutor O
. O

If O
there O
were O
to O
be O
contentious O
negotiations O
in O
the O
proceedings O
, O
information O
about O
high O

incriminated O
persons O
would O
certainly O
come O
up O

In O
case O
of O
a O
reasonable O

, O
Matschke B-PER
would O
be O
ready O
" O
not O
to O
reveal O
these O
things O
in O

But O
in O
order O
to O
restore O
his O
" O
honor O
" O
and O
his O
" O
business O
reputation O
, O
" O
the O
man O
from O
Frankfurt B-MISC
would O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Hanoverian B-MISC
's O
impression O
, O
do O
everything O
in O
his O
power O
to O
prove O
his O
professional O
activities O
for O
the O
state B-LOC
of I-LOC
Saxony I-LOC
- O
Anhalt O
by O
testifying O
. O

One O
could O
assume O
that O
Prime O
Minister O
Münch B-PER

the O
Magdeburg B-MISC
Ministry B-ORG
of O
the O

would O
have O
immediately O
called O

But O

, O
who O

Mahn B-PER
, O
who O
had O
headed O
the O
Office B-ORG
for O
the O
Protection O
of O
the O
Constitution O
in O
Hanover B-LOC
for O
some O
time O
, O
apparently O
saw O
no O
need O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxony I-MISC
Ministry B-ORG
of O
the O
Interior O
to O
the O
peculiar O
agent O
activities O
of O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxony I-MISC
official O
Boinowitz B-PER
, O
of O
which O
he O
had O
learned O
through O
Schapers B-PER
notes O
. O

In O
the O
heated O
arguments O
of O
the O
past O
days O
also O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxony I-MISC
side O
had O
to O
put O
up O
with O
some O
questions O
: O

Why O
had O
the O
Hanoverian B-MISC
Office O
for O
the O
Protection O
of O
the O
Constitution O
, O
if O
it O
believed O
to O
have O
received O
incriminating O
information O
about O
a O
minister O
of O
Saxony B-MISC
- I-MISC
Anhalt I-MISC
, O
not O
addressed O
the O
minister O
himself O
? O

Or O
the O
head O
of O
government O
there O
? O

Or O
the O
special O
commission O
set O
up O
by O
the O
Magdeburg B-MISC
state I-MISC
parliament O
to O
investigate O
members O
of O
parliament O
? O

Or O
the O
Gauck B-MISC
authority I-MISC
? O

Would O
it O
not O
have O
been O
even O
best O
to O
turn O
the O
information O
because O
of O
low O
quality O
immediately O
by O
the O
shredder O
? O

These O
questions O
arose O
all O
the O
more O
urgently O
because O
Interior O
Minister O
Glogowski B-PER
had O
meanwhile O
stated O
in O
his O
answer O
to O
a O
question O
from O
the O
FDP B-ORG
that O
the O
questioning O
of O
the O
former O
Stasi B-MISC
officer I-MISC
had O
also O
produced O
references O
to O
other O
East O
German B-MISC
politicians O
as O
well O
as O
to O
a O
West B-MISC
German I-MISC
who O
had O
been O
a O
member O
of O
a O
state O
government O
and O
was O
no O
longer O
alive O
. O

Glogowski B-PER
attached O
particular O
importance O
to O
the O
last O
information O
because O
the O
informant O
in O
this O
case O
had O
not O
only O
reported O
from O
hearsay O
but O
from O
his O
own O
knowledge O
and O
had O
thus O
incriminated O
himself O
. O

The O
news B-ORG
agency I-ORG
Deutscher I-ORG
Depeschen I-ORG
- O
Dienst O
( O
ddp B-ORG

promptly O
reported O
the O
name O
of O
Uwe B-PER
Barschel I-PER
. O

In O
the O
disputes O
between O
Hanover B-LOC
and O
Cologne B-LOC
there O
is O
now O
a O
new O
topic O
: O

One O
argues O
about O
whose O
task O
it O
is O
probably O
to O
inform O
the O
public O
. O

The O
Stasi B-MISC
officer I-MISC
with O
the O
code O
name O
" O
Share B-PER
" O
, O
so O
BfV B-MISC
president I-MISC
Werthebach B-PER
argues O
, O
had O
always O
been O
led O
and O
paid O
by O
Lower O
Saxony B-LOC
. O

That O
is O
why O
the O
Hanoverian B-MISC
Ministry B-ORG
of O
the O
Interior O
is O
also O
the O
" O
master O
of O
the O
personal O

that O
has O
accrued O
" O
. O

One O
puts O
on O
this O
shoe O
at O

only O
reluctantly O
. O

For O
the O
constitutional O
protectors O
of O
Lower B-MISC
Saxony I-MISC
it O
was O
convenient O
to O
declare O
some O
of O
their O
activities O
as O
work O
for O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Office I-ORG
. O

This O
included O
all O
kinds O
of O
activities O
in O
the O
neighboring O
state O
of O
Saxony B-LOC

Anhalt I-LOC
, O
for O
which O
the O
Lower B-MISC

not O

legal O
basis O
. O

Only O
three O

, O
the O

formally O
informed O
the O

would O

He O
himself O
is O
not O

with O
the O

. O

Schaper B-PER
only O
wanted O

The O
