the O

you O

you O
also O

yourself O

I O

You O
can O
see O
it O
in O

of O
the O

footballer O
of O

that O
I O
am O
the O

after O
Thomas B-PER
Häßler I-PER

He O
plays O
abroad O
- O
in O
the O
Bundesliga B-MISC

especially O
if O
you O
see O
last O

I O
already O
believe O
that O
I O
am O
one O
of O
the O
best O
three O
midfielders O

" O

" O
That O
sounds O
more O
confident O
than O

when O
you O
preferred O

keep O
a O
low O

I O
will O
never O

any O

anything O

I O
can O
say O
that O
I O
am O
one O
of O
the O
best O

I O
think O
that O
is O
legitimate O
and O
not O
arrogant O

" O

" O
Were O
you O
satisfied O
with O
your O
performance O
today O
? O
" O

" O
Actually O
, O
yes O
. O

If O
I O
had O
been O
one O
hundred O
percent O
fit O
in O
the O
second O
half O

then O
I O
would O
certainly O
have O
scored O
one O
or O
two O
more O
goals O

" O

" O
So O
an O
optimal O
start O

you O

eliminates O
Bein B-PER

wins O

game O

" O

Since O
neither O
the O
Danish B-MISC
European B-MISC
champion I-MISC
Kim B-PER
Christofte I-PER
nor O
Olaf B-PER
Janßen I-PER
were O
granted O
to O
disturb O
the O
circles O
of O
the O
national O
player O
, O
the O
result O
consistently O
reflected O
the O
balance O
of O
power O
on O
the O
pitch O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
Bein B-PER
was O
not O
even O
in O
full O
possession O
of O
his O
powers O
. O
" O

After O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
, O
I O
pulled O
an O
abdominal O
muscle O
in O
a O
shot O

the O
31 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
veteran O
after O
his O
substitution O
midway O
through O
the O
second O
half O
. O

This O
was O
also O
the O
reason O
why O
Bein B-PER
's O
game O
was O
much O
more O
offensively O
oriented O
. O

Again O
and O
again O
he O
went O
with O
in O
the O
top O
, O
to O
avoid O
the O
duels O
in O
midfield O
. O

Attacker O
Axel B-PER
Kruse I-PER
let O
himself O
fall O
back O
a O
bit O
and O
Anthony B-PER
Yeboah I-PER
was O
finally O
the O
beneficiary O
. O

A O
few O
minutes O
before O
halftime O
, O
the O
Ghanaian B-MISC
managed O
the O
winning O
goal O
, O
after O
fine O
preparatory O
work O
by O
Bein B-PER
, O
whose O
cross O
was O
not O
sharp O
, O
but O
as O
if O
circled O
towards O
the O
head O
of O
Yeboah B-PER

, O
where O
was O
national O

this O

. O

Questions O
that O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
two O
Cologne B-MISC
. O

Especially O
Illgner B-PER
, O
who O
was O
glued O
to O
his O
goal O
line O
, O
while O
Yeboah B-PER
could O
act O
unchallenged O
in O
the O
five O
- O
meter O
area O
. O

One O
, O
who O
no O
longer O
belongs O
to O
the O
circle O
of O
Eintracht B-ORG
, O
was O
despite O
everything O
again O
in O
the O
center O
: O

The O
" O
Juventus B-MISC
player I-MISC
" O
, O
as O
Stepanovic B-PER
also O
continues O
to O
call O
Andreas B-PER
Möller I-PER
, O
haunted O
all O
minds O
. O

And O
captain O
Uli B-PER
Stein I-PER
finally O
put O
into O
words O
what O
many O
thought O
: O

" O
It O
goes O
also O
without O
Möller B-PER
. O

There O
is O
more O
fighting O
, O
we O
all O
stick O
together O
. O

So O
we O
would O
have O
become O
champions O
last O
season O
. O
" O

Another O
clear O
rebuff O
for O
Möller B-PER
, O
whom O
no O
one O
cried O
a O
tear O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
victory O
. O

But O
maybe O
Stein B-PER
just O
wanted O
to O
distract O
from O
his O
own O
- O
not O
always O
flawless O
- O
performance O
. O

Twice O
he O
strayed O
a O
bit O
disoriented O
through O
the O
penalty O
area O
, O
twice O
Eintracht O
was O
very O
lucky O
not O
to O
have O
fallen O
behind O
. O

Alfons B-PER
Higl I-PER
put O
a O
header O
on O
the O
outer O
net O
, O
before O
it O
was O
Olaf B-PER
Janßen I-PER
, O
who O
in O
the O
first O
section O
only O
hit O
the O
crossbar O
, O
this O
time O
the O
ball O
over O
the O
defense O
lupfte O
and O
the O
again O
very O
run O
- O
happy O
Rudi B-PER
Bommer I-PER
could O
beat O
the O
leather O
just O
off O
the O
goal O
line O
. O

Take O
a O
breath O
and O
praise O
. O

Stein B-PER
tats O
in O
his O
own O
way O
: O

A O
slap O
on O
the O
butt O
of O
the O
former O
Aschaffenburger B-MISC
, O
then O
praising O
words O
about O
his O
" O
very O
good O
performance O
" O
. O

The O
Frankfurt B-MISC
team O
should O
have O
won O
even O
more O
on O
this O
day O
. O

Especially O
Bein B-PER
had O
three O
opportunities O
to O
increase O
the O
score O
. O

But O
the O
closest O
was O
Yeboah B-PER
. O

His O
shot O
from O
20 O
meters O
, O
however O
, O
slapped O
only O
against O
the O
post O
, O
after O
the O
substitute O
Stefan B-PER
Studer I-PER
had O
carelessly O
wasted O
the O
ball O
in O
a O
promising O
position O
. O

Symptomatic O
for O
the O
Eintracht B-ORG
. O
" O

The O
team O
is O
playful O
, O
it O
does O
not O
stick O
to O
the O
tasks O
. O

But O
I O
like O
them O
and O
I O
like O
them O
that O
way O
" O
, O
Stepanovic B-PER
tried O
to O
put O
the O
frivolity O
of O
his O
men O
in O
a O
better O
light O
. O

At O
the O
latest O
at O
this O
point O
the O
game O
was O
over O
. O

In O
favor O
of O
Frankfurt B-MISC
, O
because O
the O
1st B-ORG
FC I-ORG
Cologne I-ORG
, O
which O
had O
dissolved O
the O
libero O
position O
after O
the O
change O

nothing O

compelling O
succeeded O
. O

This O
also O
saw O
Stepanovic B-PER

had O
stood O
lokker O
and O
solved O
for O
90 O
minutes O
next O
to O
the O
coach O

. O

No O

, O
when O
referee O
Bernd B-PER
Heynemann I-PER
from O

pressed O
the O
air O
through O
the O
whistle O
after O
ninety O
minutes O
, O
ended O
the O
game O
and O
formally O
confirmed O
the O
first O
victory O
of O
Eintracht B-ORG

" O

Stepi B-PER
" O
stood O
again O
where O
he O
sees O
himself O
most O
: O

in O
the O
center O

While O
the O

did O
their O
lap O
of O
honor O
, O
Stepanovic B-PER

into O

If O
Wehen B-ORG
's I-ORG
president O
Heinz B-PER
Hankammer I-PER
turns O
during O
a O
play O
with O
long O
steps O
his O
rounds O
around O
the O
sports O
field O
, O
the O
world O
is O
all O
right O
from O
his O
view O
. O

But O
if O
he O
stops O
or O
even O
restlessly O
walks O
up O
and O
down O
, O
it O
is O
a O
bad O
sign O
. O

This O
second O
gait O
could O
be O
observed O
on O
Friday O
at O
the O
disappointing O
0 O

in O
Bad B-LOC
Homburg I-LOC
, O
and O
accordingly O
fell O
out O
the O

commentary O
: O

" O
That O
's O
desolate O
, O
what O
my O
players O
offer O
. O

Now O
there O
must O
be O
a O
thunderstorm O
in O
the O
cabin O
. O
" O

For O
the O
thunderstorm O
provided O
Heinz B-PER
Wulf I-PER
, O
who O
accused O
his O
team O
in O
the O
cabin O
of O
refusal O
to O
work O
and O
spoke O
at O
the O
press O
conference O
of O
a O
miserable O
performance O
of O
SV B-ORG
Wehen I-ORG
. O

As O
a O
mitigating O
circumstance O
he O
let O
the O
load O
by O
the O
cup O
game O
against O
Eintracht B-ORG
Frankfurt I-ORG
apply O
, O
but O
that O
was O
rather O
an O
appeasement O
attempt O
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
SV B-ORG
Wehen I-ORG
has O
made O
a O
false O
start O
for O
the O
third O
time O
in O
a O
row O
despite O
high O
objectives O
. O

The O
technical O
director O
Karlheinz B-PER
Kühn I-PER
no O
longer O
understands O
the O
world O
: O

" O
We O
had O
an O
excellent O
preparation O
, O
the O
mood O
in O
the O
team O
is O
good O
, O
and O
we O
have O
strengthened O
our O
squad O
by O
above O
- O
average O
players O
, O
who O
also O
fit O
us O
humanly O
. O

As O
a O
problem O
in O
the O
first O
matches O
, O
I O
can O
only O
discover O
the O
crisis O
of O
form O
of O
our O
goalkeeper O
Vogler B-PER
, O
but O
that O
also O
seems O
to O
be O
settled O
after O
the O
last O
two O
games O
. O
" O

Coach O
Wulf B-PER
cites O
other O
reasons O
for O
the O
false O
start O
: O

" O
We O
had O
to O
install O
six O
new O
players O
, O
that O
takes O
time O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
key O
players O
such O
as O
Schröder B-PER
and O
Feyen B-PER
were O
injured O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
and O
the O
great O
talent O
Michael B-PER
Sauer I-PER
has O
been O
confused O
rather O
than O
built O
up O
by O
the O
many O
contacts O
with O
Bundesliga B-MISC
clubs I-MISC
. O
" O

With O
these O
arguments O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
false O
start O
this O
season O
can O
be O
explained O
, O
but O
more O
questions O
remain O
: O

How O
is O
it O
that O
SV B-ORG
Wehen I-ORG
, O
despite O
prominent O
new O
arrivals O
in O
the O
last O
three O
years O
under O
five O
different O
coaches O
regularly O
disappointed O
? O

Where O
are O
the O
reasons O
that O
players O
like O
Schröder B-PER
, O
Feyen B-PER
, O
Sauer B-PER
or O
Caic B-PER
, O
who O
have O
been O
courted O
by O
the O
Bundesliga O
, O
have O
stagnated O
in O
their O
performance O
since O
they O
joined O
SV B-ORG
Wehen I-ORG
? O

The O
reasons O
for O
this O
must O
probably O
be O
sought O
in O
the O
structures O
of O
the O
club O
. O

Wehen O
has O
risen O
in O
an O
unprecedented O
march O
from O
1986 O
to O
1989 O
from O
the O
A O
- O
class O
to O
the O
Oberliga O
and O
has O
retained O
structures O
that O
have O
proven O
themselves O
in O
the O
lower O
classes O
, O
but O
for O
a O
promotion O
aspirant O
of O
the O
Oberliga O
must O
be O
reviewed O
. O

Thus O
some O
players O
, O
who O
changed O
from O
other O
clubs O
to O
Wehen O
, O
complain O
that O
it O
is O
too O
village O
, O
too O
familiar O
and O
too O
cozy O
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
one O
gets O
used O
to O
the O
casual O
routine O
and O
feels O
quite O
comfortable O
in O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

Karlheinz B-PER
Kühn I-PER
admits O
that O
the O
team O
is O
sometimes O
satisfied O
too O
quickly O
: O

" O
After O
the O
cup O
match O
against O
Eintracht B-ORG
, O
there O
was O
an O
almost O
exuberant O
mood O
in O
our O
team O
, O
although O
with O
more O
self O
- O
criticism O
, O
they O
should O
have O
realized O
that O
they O
have O
not O
delivered O
a O
dogged O
fight O
to O
Eintracht B-ORG
. O
" O

As O
not O
optimal O
is O
considered O
by O
some O
players O
also O
the O
medical O
care O
. O

It O
is O
made O
responsible O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
came O
in O
the O
past O
season O
to O
15 O
serious O
injuries O
. O

It O
is O
also O
astonishing O
that O
Wehen O
is O
the O
only O
top O
club O
in O
the O
Oberliga O
to O
train O
only O
three O
times O
a O
week O
. O

The O
Offenbacher B-MISC
train O
against O
it O
five O
to O
six O
times O
per O
week O
. O

Possibly O
also O
the O
Wehener B-ORG
model O
to O
offer O
to O
the O
players O
in O
the O
enterprise O
of O
Hankammer B-PER
a O
good O
vocational O
perspective O
contains O
a O
treacherous O
trap O
. O

Will O
a O
28 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
family O
man O
( O
the O
average O
age O
of O
the O
team O
is O
28 O
years O
) O
once O
again O
fully O
concentrate O
on O
soccer O
if O
he O
sees O
attractive O
opportunities O
for O
promotion O
in O
Hankammer B-PER
's O
company O
and O
in O
addition O
can O
pocket O
the O
Oberliga O
fees O
as O
a O
considerable O
extra O
income O
? O

Also O
Heinz B-PER
Hankammer I-PER
came O
over O
such O
questions O
into O
the O
brooding O
. O

On O
Sunday O
morning O
he O
explained O
to O
the O
FR B-ORG
: O

" O
I O
have O
discovered O
a O
certain O
phlegm O
in O
the O
team O
and O
am O
accordingly O
angry O
. O

I O
will O
discuss O
all O
problems O
openly O
at O
a O
dinner O
with O
the O
team O
. O

One O
thing O
seems O
to O
me O
but O
now O
already O
certain O
, O
that O
we O
must O
rely O
in O
the O
future O
increasingly O
on O
young O
hungry O
players O

Robert B-PER
Gemeri I-PER

who O
returned O
to O

Only O
then O
came O
the O

through O

Holtkamp B-PER

Ferreiro B-PER
better O
into O
the O
game O

thus O
to O

Neukirchen B-ORG

goalkeeper O
Ernst B-PER
knew O
in O
this O
phase O

however O
, O
skillfully O
to O
prevent O
a O

Shortly O
before O
the O
half O

time O
break O
then O
presented O
referee O
Althaus B-LOC
both O
teams O
and O
the O
observers O
his O
first O

questionable O

appearance O
. O

Gemeri B-PER
fetched O
Müller B-PER
clearly O
from O
the O
legs O

but O
the O
penalty O
whistle O
was O
not O
blown O
. O

Not O
out O
remained O
his O
whistle O
, O
however O
, O
after O
the O

. O

Because O
the O
impartial O
wanted O
to O

recognized O
a O
foul O
of O
Trageser B-PER
at O
Schmier B-PER
. O

The O
resulting O
penalty O
Romeo B-PER

the O

Brechtel B-PER
worries O
incidentally O
less O
about O
quantities O
than O
qualities O
. O

For O
the O
groundwater O
, O
he O
says O
, O
has O
already O
deteriorated O
. O

The O
forest O
hydrologist O
assigns O
the O
blame O
for O
this O
clearly O
to O
the O
pollutants O
. O

They O
come O
through O
the O
rain O
and O
the O
trees O
into O
the O
soil O
, O
which O
- O
if O
intact O
- O
is O
an O
excellent O
filter O
. O

However O
, O
the O
soil O
has O
already O
lost O
this O
ability O
to O
filter O
out O
pollutants O
, O
mainly O
due O
to O
" O
acid O
rain O
" O
. O

The O
forest O
soil O
is O
already O
completely O
" O
broken O
" O
in O
many O
places O
. O
Brechtel B-PER
knows O
. O

Aluminum O
, O
for O
example O
, O
is O
now O
entering O
the O
groundwater O
and O
thus O
the O
drinking O
water O
reservoir O
unhindered O
. O

The O
waterworks O
will O
soon O
have O
problems O
with O
this O
, O
Brechtel B-PER
predicts O
. O

His O
advice O
: O

Instead O
of O
spending O
money O
on O
the O
then O
necessary O
water O
treatment O
, O
the O
waterworks O
should O
" O
wisely O
" O
contribute O
to O
the O
cost O
of O
liming O
- O
and O
hope O
that O
the O
forest O
survives O
as O
a O
water O
producer O
thanks O
to O
these O
Überbrükkungsmaßnahmen O
, O
until O
the O
pollution O
levels O
are O
drastically O
reduced O
. O

Three O
tons O
of O
lime O
per O
hectare O
have O
already O
been O
spread O
in O
parts O
of O
the O
Reinhard B-LOC
Forest I-LOC
to O
protect O
the O
soil O
( O
for O
about O
ten O
years O
) O
and O
to O
save O
the O
trees O
for O
the O
next O
millennium O
. O

By O
that O
time O
, O
harmful O
emissions O
would O
have O
to O
be O
drastically O
reduced O
, O
says O
Brechtel B-PER
. O

If O
in O
this O
respect O
" O
not O
finally O
" O
something O
happens O
, O
one O
can O
save O
the O
liming O
of O
the O
forests O
: O

" O
Then O
one O
should O
rather O
give O
the O
money O
directly O
to O
starving O
children O
" O
. O

The O
expert O
tried O
to O
reassure O
those O
who O
are O
worried O
about O
the O
trees O
in O
the O
Reinhardswald B-LOC
because O
of O
the O
planned O
additional O
water O
withdrawals O
. O

In O
the O
Hessian B-MISC
fen O
, O
the O
oaks O
died O
abruptly O
, O
when O
more O
water O
was O
tapped O
and O
the O
groundwater O
level O
dropped O
from O
two O
meters O
deep O
to O
seven O
meters O
. O

This O
, O
so O
Brechtel B-PER
assures O
, O
will O
not O
happen O
in O
the O
Reinhardswald B-LOC
. O

Not O
everyone O
believed O
him O
: O

" O
I O
hope O
" O
, O
said O
one O
forest O

, O
" O

we O
also O
wanted O
to O
score O

" O

This O
succeeded O
only O
once O
, O
because O
not O
too O
much O
chances O
were O
worked O
out O

but O
also O
because O
Hartmann B-PER

Mahler B-PER

Second O
Symphony O
, O
in O
C O
minor O
, O
a O
gigantic O
piece O
of O
late O
Romantic O
symphonic O
music O
, O
whose O
performance O
lasts O
just O
under O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
, O
is O
in O
its O
instrumentation O
- O
orchestra O
, O
chorus O
and O
solos O
- O
rather O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
symphonic O
cantata O
. O

At O
its O
premiere O
in O
1895 O
, O
this O
symphony O
aroused O
intense O
controversy O
. O

Today O
, O
probably O
because O
of O
its O
melodic O
" O
rapture O
" O
and O
its O
harmonic O
drama O
, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
Mahler B-PER

more O
popular O
compositions O
- O
a O
symphonist O
, O
by O
the O
way O

whose O

" O
took O
place O
in O
the O
early O
1960s O

At O
that O
time O
one O
spoke O
of O
a O
" O

" O
. O

Within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
interpretational O
sharpness O
with O
which O
Inbal B-PER
allowed O
the O
monumental O
work O
to O
develop O
in O
a O
clear O
and O
logical O
manner O
, O
it O
was O
above O
all O
the O
vocal O
solos O
of O
Alexandra B-PER
Coku I-PER
and O
Cornelia B-PER
Wulkopf I-PER
that O
guaranteed O
- O
in O
the O
finale O
- O
truly O
iridescent O
, O
linear O
as O

as O
deeply O
penetrating O
contours O
. O

Especially O
Alexandra B-PER
Coku I-PER
, O
the O
soprano O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
captured O
the O
C O
major O
aura O
in O
the O
mighty O
epilogue O
of O
the O
symphony O
textually O
concise O
, O
clear O
and O
with O
exemplary O
intensity O
and O
concentration O
. O

Everything O
had O
begun O
quite O
differently O
. O

Inbal B-PER
, O
who O
had O
the O
orchestra O
, O
the O
Prague B-ORG
Symphony I-ORG
Orchestra O
, O
under O
control O
, O
interpreted O
the O
difficult O
psychology O
in O
the O
opening O
movement O
in O
a O
way O
that O
made O
one O
sit O
up O
and O
take O
notice O
. O

It O
seemed O
that O
the O
accents O
wandering O
through O
the O
ensemble O
were O
uncoordinated O
, O
the O
line O
emerging O
only O
hesitantly O
: O

An O
irritating O
disposition O
for O
Mahler B-PER
's I-PER
epically O
widening O
symphony O
. O

This O
came O
at O
first O
only O
dully O
accentuated O
, O
pale O
in O
the O
string O
substance O
otherwise O
surrounded O
by O
aura O
. O

Then O
the O
first O
wind O
signals O
, O
punctual O
, O
precise O
and O
full O
of O
charisma O
: O

This O
was O
conducting O
suggestion O
, O
but O
also O
orchestral O
, O
instrumental O
conciseness O
and O
virtuosity O
. O

Inbal B-PER
drives O
everything O
forward O
ceaselessly O
. O

The O
éclat O
in O
the O
tutti O
has O
a O
crystal O
- O
clear O
profile O
, O
but O
there O
is O
also O
- O
no O
less O
intense O
- O
the O
morbid O
, O
" O
negating O
" O
gesture O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
becomes O
sugary O
sweet O
: O

of O
course O
, O
that O
belongs O
to O
Mahler B-PER
, O
who O
probably O
( O
except O
perhaps O
Richard B-PER
Strauss I-PER
) O
thought O
of O
the O
most O
beautiful O
melodies O
of O
the O
tonal O
era O
that O
is O
coming O
to O
an O
end O
. O

That O
ebbs O
, O
silts O
up O
, O
builds O
up O
- O
vividly O
- O
anew O
, O
thus O
has O
a O
clear O
basic O
idea O
. O

Admirable O
was O
also O
the O
rhythmic O
" O
bite O
" O
, O
which O
Inbal B-PER
seems O
to O
make O
the O
leitmotif O
of O
his O
interpretation O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
too O
, O
the O
performance O
had O
backbone O
. O

Finally O
the O
choirs O
, O
the O
Frankfurt B-ORG

( O

Rarichs I-PER
) O
and O
the O
Caecilienchor B-ORG
Frankfurt I-ORG
( O

Christian B-PER

. O

This O
comes O
, O
as O
Mahler B-PER
wills O
, O
as O
Inbal B-PER
does O
, O
at O
first O
in O
great O
calm O
, O

a O

In O

The O
player O

more O

" O
Maybe O
he O

the O

" O

Krause B-PER
is O
facing O
various O

Possibly O
the O
Kleinschmidt B-PER

was O
not O
even O

On O

throws O

The O
intention O
of O
the O

to O
exclude O
the O

The O
real O
surprise O

the O

the O

Beside O

there O
was O
also O

performed O
several O

in O

In O
the O
small O
paper O
it O
was O
to O
be O
read O
recently O
, O
clever O
agrarian O
economists O
had O
organized O
pig O
races O
for O
the O
disdainful O
amusement O
of O
the O
public O
, O
which O
naturally O
hunted O
the O
honorable O
guild B-ORG
of I-ORG
the O
animal O
protectionists O
on O
the O
palm O
. O

For O
ours O
, O
however O
, O
it O
may O
be O
left O
open O
whether O
the O
German B-MISC
domestic O
pig O
, O
praised O
as O
intelligent O
, O
is O
more O
nimble O
on O
hoof O
than O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
the O
French B-MISC
Périgord B-MISC
pig I-MISC
. O

Because O
the O
two O
relevant O
racing O
games O
bring O
at O
most O
the O
player O
, O
but O
no O
boar O
in O
stress O
and O
call O
consequently O
also O
no O
animal O
protection O
association O
on O
the O
plan O
. O

The O
PIG B-MISC
RACING I-MISC
proves O
once O
again O
how O
varied O
game O
material O
can O
be O
. O

As O
game O
pieces O
, O
each O
of O
the O
two O
to O
four O
players O
gets O
two O
fat O
, O
spherical O
piggy O
banks O
and O
a O
few O
gold O
coins O
, O
which O
he O
may O
distribute O
to O
the O
two O
piglets O
as O
he O
pleases O
. O

Symbols O
are O
distributed O
over O
the O
game O
board O
. O

You O
can O
pick O
up O
gold O
coins O
on O
the O
way O
and O
put O
them O
into O
any O
pig O
- O
your O
own O
, O
of O
course O
. O

Or O
there O
are O
black O
bad O
luck O
talers O
. O

You O
can O
also O
put O
them O
into O
any O
pig O
- O
an O
opponent O
's O
pig O
, O
of O
course O
. O

And O
finally O
the O
pig O
picture O
allows O
to O
take O
any O
piggy O
bank O
from O
the O
plan O
, O
hold O
it O
to O
the O
ear O
and O
shake O
it O
. O

So O
you O
can O
determine O
which O
competing O
piglet O
wants O
to O
run O
to O
the O
finish O
with O
a O
fat O
belly O
, O
to O
feed O
it O
on O
the O
way O
still O
neatly O
with O
pitch O
thalers O
. O

The O
movements O
determine O
a O
cube O
, O
which O
has O
only O
eyes O
from O
1 O
to O
3 O
. O

The O
piggy O
banks O
do O
not O
displace O
each O
other O
from O
the O
plan O
. O

If O
a O
field O
is O
occupied O
, O
it O
is O
simply O
not O
counted O
and O
skipped O
. O

Therefore O
it O
is O
called O
, O
with O
the O
second O
pig O
always O
pretty O
stay O
at O
the O
pack O
. O

Who O
is O
once O
lost O
, O
no O
longer O
comes O
forward O
quickly O
, O
because O
he O
can O
not O
constantly O
hobble O
over O
others O
. O

At O
the O
finish O
there O
are O
again O
bonuses O
. O

Then O
it O
is O
counted O
. O

For O
every O
black O
coin O
a O
golden O
one O
is O
lost O
. O

The O
winner O
is O
of O
course O
the O
one O
who O
could O
drag O
the O
fattest O
booty O
to O
the O
finish O
. O

In O
the O
well O
understandable O
rule O
is O
a O
" O
tip O
" O
included O
. O

After O
that O
it O
is O
allowed O
to O
exchange O
the O
colored O
caps O
of O
the O
money O
boxes O
with O
those O
of O
the O
other O
players O
, O
so O
that O
everyone O
can O
distinguish O
his O
two O
boxes O
. O

But O
this O
kills O
the O
game O
. O

If O
both O
figures O
look O
the O
same O
, O
it O
is O
much O
harder O
to O
remember O
which O
counter O
pig O
is O
specifically O
fed O
and O
which O
is O
just O
dragged O
along O
. O

The O
title O
PIG B-MISC
GALLOPP I-MISC
sounds O
similar O
, O
but O
the O
game O
is O
completely O
different O
. O

The O
highly O
amusing O
graphics O
are O
suitable O
for O
children O
and O
mislead O
as O
well O
as O
the O
age O
indication O
six O
to O
twelve O
years O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
children O
in O
this O
age O
range O
can O
play O
this O
game O
. O

But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
it O
is O
also O
an O
unrecognized O
and O
in O
this O
camouflage O
almost O
undetectable O
racer O
for O
adults O
. O

The O
PIG B-MISC
GALLOP I-MISC
has O
meanwhile O
established O
itself O
with O
us O
as O
a O
constant O
fast O
" O
in O
- O
between O
game O
" O
and O
causes O
enthusiasm O
with O
everyone O
who O
gets O
to O
know O
it O
. O

The O
plan O
shows O
a O
circuit O
without O
start O
and O
finish O
. O

On O
it O
you O
place O
in O
any O
order O
without O
gaps O
five O
colorful O
racing O
pigs O
. O

They O
are O
very O
nice O
cast O
out O
of O
solid O
plastic O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
be O
very O
careful O
that O
they O
do O
not O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
children O
. O

Otherwise O
they O
are O
guaranteed O
to O
be O
missing O
from O
the O
game O
box O
and O
end O
up O
in O
trouser O
pockets O
or O
in O
the O
box O
with O
the O
building O
blocks O
. O

Next O
to O
the O
game O
board O
are O
food O
chips O
. O

Each O
player O
gets O
seven O
cards O
. O

Initially O
, O
one O
searches O
, O
just O
as O
with O
the O
different O
food O
tokens O
, O
for O
an O
interpretation O
for O
the O
graphics O
. O

But O
it O
is O
all O
much O
simpler O
: O

Chip O
is O
chip O
, O
and O
with O
the O
cards O
only O
the O
background O
color O
counts O
. O

The O
player O
whose O
turn O
it O
is O
puts O
down O
a O
card O
and O
moves O
the O
pig O
of O
that O
color O
. O

So O
no O
player O
owns O
a O
particular O
piece O
. O

Anyone O
can O
move O
any O
pig O
. O

As O
in O
PIG B-MISC
SEPARATION I-MISC
, O
occupied O
squares O
are O
not O
counted O
. O

A O
pig O
simply O
moves O
one O
square O
ahead O
, O
and O
if O
others O
are O
in O
the O
way O
, O
they O
are O
skipped O
. O

If O
the O
sow O
that O
has O
just O
moved O
lands O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
herd O
with O
her O
move O
, O
she O
is O
offered O
a O
food O
chip O
as O
a O
reward O
. O

The O
player O
takes O
a O
food O
disc O
and O
places O
it O
in O
front O
of O
him O
. O

But O
it O
does O
not O
belong O
to O
him O
yet O
. O

The O
round O
is O
over O
quickly O
because O
everyone O
can O
only O
play O
seven O
cards O
. O

The O
trick O
lies O
in O
the O
last O
move O
. O

Only O
if O
you O
manage O
to O
put O
a O
pig O
on O
top O
, O
the O
food O
points O
collected O
up O
to O
that O
point O
are O
secured O
. O

Three O
rounds O
are O
played O
, O
which O
takes O
less O
than O
ten O
minutes O
for O
experienced O
players O
. O

The O
joke O
of O
the O
game O
lies O
in O
tearing O
apart O
the O
closed O
group O
of O
pigs O
by O
moving O
pieces O
from O
the O
center O
. O

This O
forces O
the O
other O
players O
to O
bring O
the O
stragglers O
back O
to O
the O
top O
, O
which O
costs O
cards O
without O
bringing O
in O
chips O
. O

But O
in O
the O
process O
you O
can O
speculate O
so O
badly O
. O

Before O
you O
know O
it O
, O
the O
sow O
that O
matches O
the O
last O
card O
is O
cut O
off O
and O
isolated O
. O

And O
some O
fellow O
player O
remarks O
gloatingly O
: O

" O
Being O
a O
pig O
is O
beautiful O
... O

" O

The O

Do O
you O
already O
have O
a O
hobby O
? O

Interpret O
animal O
tracks O

In O
former O
times O
the O
ability O
to O
recognize O
and O
interpret O
animal O
tracks O
was O
vital O
for O
humans O
, O
after O
all O
the O
hunting O
success O
or O
the O
survival O
often O
depended O
on O
it O
. O

Nowadays O
it O
is O
still O
important O
for O
hunters O
and O
foresters O
to O
be O
able O
to O
read O
tracks O
in O
order O
to O
estimate O
the O
game O
population O
correctly O
. O

In O
our O
time O
it O
is O
important O
for O
the O
protection O
of O
the O
wild O
animals O
that O
as O
many O
people O
as O
possible O
also O
have O
knowledge O
about O
their O
habits O
- O
because O
who O
can O
interpret O
animal O
tracks O
, O
learns O
many O
behaviors O
of O
the O
animals O
. O

He O
can O
therefore O
take O
into O
account O
the O
needs O
of O
wild O
animals O
more O
than O
someone O
who O
walks O
" O
blindly O
" O
through O
the O
woods O
and O
meadows O
. O

The O
search O
for O
traces O
can O
become O
an O
interesting O
hobby O
, O
in O
which O
one O
can O
also O
do O
something O
for O
his O
health O
. O

While O
one O
often O
discovered O
during O
a O
walk O
through O
forest O
and O
field O
except O
some O
birds O
and O
insects O
no O
other O
animal O
, O
because O
most O
mammals O
are O
crepuscular O
or O
nocturnal O
and O
shy O
, O
it O
can O
be O
a O
very O
interesting O
hobby O
. O

However O
, O
signs O
and O
tracks O
left O
by O
animals O
tell O
the O
expert O
a O
lot O
about O
their O
presence O
and O
behavior O
. O

For O
example O
the O
squirrels O
: O

young O
squirrels O
must O
first O
learn O
to O
crack O
a O
nut O
properly O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
gnaw O
marks O
on O
hazelnuts O
reveal O
whether O
a O
young O
, O
inexperienced O
or O
an O
old O
, O
experienced O
animal O
has O
tried O
its O
hand O
as O
a O
nutcracker O
. O

Feeding O
traces O
of O
birds O
at O
fruit O
are O
to O
be O
recognized O
clearly O
by O
the O
pecking O
traces O
. O

Thrushes O
hollow O
out O
apples O
by O
pecking O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
skin O
and O
then O
extracting O
the O
pulp O
, O
spruce O
crossbills O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
are O
less O
interested O
in O
the O
pulp O
, O
but O
only O
in O
the O
seeds O
. O

A O
walk O
in O
the O
forest O
can O
be O
quite O
exciting O

were O
still O

about O
how O

also O
the O

not O

in O

, O
although O
the O

While O
the O

spirit O
, O
FSV B-ORG
benefited O
from O
his O

the O

The O

The O
psychological O
problems O
at O
FSV B-ORG
predicted O

many O
in O
the O

up O

The O
team O

for O

the O

Peter B-PER
Walz I-PER
experienced O
its O

ball O
was O

Five O

must O
continue O
to O
press O
the O

, O
which O
led O
her O
to O
some O
expressions O

, O
everyone O
could O
convince O
himself O
that O
the O
performance O
of O
FSV B-ORG
is O
no O
longer O
unattainable O
. O

The O
SG B-ORG
has O
found O
the O
connection O
and O
lost O
again O
in O
the O
last O
moment O
. O

There O
is O

why O

With O

prepared O
by O
the O
Protestant O

the O

Because O
" O

explains O

Wolfgang B-PER
Buttkewitz I-PER
, O
" O
that O
the O
Bible B-MISC
is O
read O
less O

less O

. O

So O
Christians B-MISC
in O
the O
Year O

had O
to O
come O
up O
with O
something O
together O

" O

" O

Therefore O
, O
the O

attract O
the O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
says O
the O

from O
the O
Mennonite B-LOC

, O
" O
Christians B-MISC
do O
it O
like O

" O
: O

Perhaps O
the O
faithful O
then O
do O
not O
always O
read O
in O
the O

but O
possibly O
more O
and O
more O
often O

And O
already O
much O
would O
be O

Especially O
in O
a O

Buttkewitz B-PER

in O
which O
" O
leisure O

adds O
that O
the O
aim O
is O
also O
to O
promote O
a O
new O
reading O
of O
the O
Bible B-MISC

After O
all O
, O
" O
for O
decades O
the O
Bible B-MISC
has O
been O
regarded O
as O
a O
book O
that O
provides O

the O
individual O

Through O
the O

the O

Therefore O

Grimm B-PER
hopes O
that O

be O
taught O
how O
to O
handle O
the O

that O

also O
drugs O
for O

preparations O

: O

they O
are O
surrounded O
with O
a O
" O
enteric O
- O
coated O

protective O
cover O

This O
means O
that O
such O
drugs O
dissolve O
only O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
and O
from O
there O
fully O
develop O
their O
active O
ingredients O
. O

In O

, O
there O
is O
also O
the O
consideration O
that O
the O
aggressive O
gastric O
juice O
should O
not O
impair O
the O

a O

, O
on O

the O

has O

Recent O

, O
however O
, O
that O
this O
is O
obviously O
quite O
wrong O

The O
controls O
showed O
namely O
that O
medicines O
remained O
much O
longer O

if O

takes O
them O

the O

The O

( O

preparations O

) O
remain O
in O
the O

as O

therefore O
do O
not O

It O
is O
particularly O
unfavorable O
if O
a O
short O
time O
( O
less O
than O
two O
hours O
) O
after O
a O
main O
meal O
with O
simultaneous O
drug O
intake O
a O
small O
snack O
is O
inserted O
. O

The O

of O
these O

has O

again O
priority O
and O
the O
medicaments O
undigested O
by O
the O
gastric O
juice O
remain O
under O
circumstances O
up O
to O
twelve O
hours O
in O
the O
stomach O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
, O
the O
conscientiously O
taken O
medicines O
in O
the O
stomach O
can O
really O
jam O
and O
clump O
together O
, O
because O
with O
the O
following O
main O
meals O
is O
usually O
already O

One O
can O
trick O
the O

with O
its O
digestive O
movements O
only O
in O
such O
a O
way O
, O
while O
one O
takes O
longer O
than O
two O
hours O
at O
all O
nothing O
edible O
to O
itself O
. O

Then O
the O
stomach O
finally O
transports O
the O
medicines O
where O
they O
belong O
- O
into O
the O
small O
intestine O
. O

But O
how O
can O
such O
mishaps O
be O
prevented O
, O
from O
which O
the O
treatment O
is O
disturbed O
and O
its O
success O
is O
sometimes O
even O
prevented O
? O

According O
to O
the O
latest O
recommendations O
of O
the O
medical O
profession O
, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
take O
so O
- O
called O
enteric O
- O
coated O
, O
small O
intestine O
- O
soluble O
drugs O
in O
the O
morning O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
during O
the O
day O
between O
meals O
. O

However O
, O
one O
must O
not O
snack O
between O
the O
main O
meals O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
the O
stomach O
does O
not O
retain O
the O
indigestible O
drugs O
any O
longer O
. O

Preparations O
taken O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
reach O
the O
small O
intestine O
within O
70 O
minutes O
at O
the O
latest O
. O

It O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
take O
into O
account O
the O
natural O
rhythm O
of O
gastric O
activity O
: O

At O
night O
this O
organ O
rests O
, O
and O
medicines O
with O
depot O
effect O
, O
as O
well O
as O
other O
indigestible O
or O
difficult O
to O
digest O
foods O
, O
remain O
in O
place O
until O
the O
stomach O
resumes O
its O
digestive O
work O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

It O
should O
also O
be O
noted O
that O
medicines O
should O
always O
be O
taken O
standing O
up O
and O
with O
plenty O
of O
liquid O
. O

They O
then O
slide O
better O
and O
do O
not O
get O
stuck O
halfway O
down O
the O
esophagus O
. O

Since O
these O
recommendations O
correspond O
to O
the O
latest O
medical O
findings O
, O
they O
are O
generally O
not O
yet O
very O
well O

20 O

He O

by O
now O
he O
knows O

where O

, O
but O
also O
who O
and O
how O
many O
people O
live O
here O
. O

In O
the O
Homburger B-LOC
Hof I-LOC
he O
has O
found O
exactly O
what O
he O
was O
looking O
for O
: O

a O
small O
, O
tranquil O
restaurant O
, O
which O
leaves O
him O
the O
time O
to O
" O
personally O
" O
take O

each O

He O
finds O
it O
" O
simply O
beautiful O
" O
that O
so O
many O
have O
come O
here O
tonight O

of O
him O

One O
thing O
is O
clear O
for O
the O

the O
" O

of O
the O

While O
the O

as O
a O

played O
the O
FSV B-ORG

The O
Bockenheimer B-MISC
determined O
the O
game O
in O
the O
first O
half O
hour O

combined O
better O
and O
had O
after O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
by O
a O
low O
shot O
by O
Björn B-PER
Pistauer I-PER
, O
which O
whizzed O
a O
meter O
past O
the O
FSV B-MISC
goal I-MISC
, O
the O
first O
great O
chance O
. O

It O
was O
striking O
how O
much O
space O
FSV B-ORG
, O
which O
seemed O
strangely O
insecure O
, O
the O
guests O
left O
. O

Then O
the O
FSV B-ORG
also O
had O
to O
change O
, O
because O
Ralf B-PER
Zgraja I-PER
injured O
himself O
after O
28 O
minutes O
already O
so O
badly O
that O
he O
had O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

For O
him O
, O
Michael B-PER
Sandt I-PER
, O
whom O
FSV B-MISC

called O
his O
model O
student O
, O
took O
over O
the O
man O

to O

man O
defense O
against O
Michael B-PER
Rexroth I-PER
. O

Nine O
minutes O
later O
came O
the O
next O
blow O
for O
FSV B-ORG
: O

After O
a O
harmless O
duel O
with O
Thomas B-PER
Hoßmang I-PER
got O
Marco B-PER
Grevelhörster I-PER
by O
the O
petty O
referee O
the O
time O
penalty O
. O

But O
with O
ten O
men O
FSV B-ORG
finally O
showed O
the O
bite O
that O
had O
been O
missing O
until O
then O
, O
and O
achieved O
through O
Collins B-PER
Etebu I-PER
the O
first O
chance O
shortly O
before O
the O
change O
, O
but O
this O
shot O
attempt O
also O

in O

Thanks O
to O
referee O

who O
gave O
out O
four O

cards O

a O
time O

45 O

, O
there O
was O
at O

a O
little O
talk O
in O
the O
break O
. O

The O
game O
itself O
offered O
until O
then O
little O
cause O
for O
discussion O
. O

After O
the O
change O
, O
FSV B-ORG

stronger O
, O

the O
nimble O

a O

Already O

Extraordinary O
was O
offered O
by O
the O
appearance O

the O

Aziza B-PER

" O
We O
attach O
particular O
importance O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
children O
feel O
good O
with O
us O
, O
because O
after O
all O
they O
are O
our O
future O
, O
" O
says O
Georg B-PER
Jovicic I-PER
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
is O
particularly O
pleased O
when O
young O
families O
with O
children O
come O
to O
the O
club O
, O
because O
" O
they O
grow O
so O
into O
the O
club O
" O
. O

The O
board O
has O
set O
itself O
the O
goal O
of O
contemporary O
club O
work O
. O
" O

We O
do O
not O
want O
to O
stick O
too O
much O
to O
traditions O
, O
so O
we O
allow O
young O
people O
from O
the O
club O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
organize O
regularly O
a O
disco O
on O
the O
premises O
" O
, O
the O
chairman O
describes O
the O
idea O
. O

The O
association O
has O
also O
been O
actively O
supporting O
physically O
disabled O
children O
for O
some O
time O
. O

Through O
connections O
between O
the O
allotment O
gardeners O
from O
Goldstein B-LOC
and O
a O
school O
for O
the O
physically O
handicapped O
in O
Würzburg B-LOC
a O
sponsorship O
has O
been O
established O
. O

Once O
a O
year O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC
gardeners O
invite O
a O
class O
from O
the O
school O
and O
spoil O
the O
children O
with O
food O
and O
presents O

Jovicic B-PER
: O

" O
For O
the O
evening O
we O
have O
organized O
a O
lantern O
procession O
through O
the O
allotment O
garden O
. O

The O
children O
are O
really O
looking O
forward O
to O
it O
. O
" O

Georg B-PER
Jovicic I-PER
is O
particularly O
pleased O
that O
so O
many O
different O
nationalities O
are O
represented O
in O
his O
association O
. O
" O

We O
have O
Italians B-MISC
, O
Japanese B-MISC
, O
Koreans B-MISC
, O
Moroccans B-MISC
, O
Portuguese B-MISC
, O
Yugoslavs B-MISC
and O
other O
nationalities O
in O
our O
association O
and O
there O
are O
no O
difficulties O
in O
living O
together O
. O
" O

But O
the O
club O
has O
another O
problem O
. O

For O
two O
years O
, O
the O
access O
road O
to O
the O
club O
premises O
has O
been O
narrowed O
by O
wooden O
posts O
. O
" O

The O
measure O
was O
therefore O
taken O
to O
prevent O
motorists O
from O
parking O
on O
the O
grass O
strip O
" O
, O
recalls O
the O
chairman O
. O

But O
since O
then O
it O
has O
become O
impossible O
for O
gardeners O
to O
drive O
larger O
vehicles O
to O
the O
club O
grounds O
. O
" O

With O
us O
also O
come O
sometimes O
suppliers O
with O
a O
transporter O
or O
we O
need O
a O
garbage O
container O
. O

There O
it O
is O
always O
scarce O
. O
" O

50 O
centimeters O
more O
space O
would O
be O
enough O
. O

But O
Jovicic B-PER
has O
so O
far O
fallen O
on O
deaf O
ears O
in O
the O
responsible O
garden B-ORG
and I-ORG
cemetery I-ORG
office I-ORG
. O

Preparations O
for O
the O
next O
festival O
will O
already O
begin O
in O
the O
coming O
weeks O
. O
" O

Then O
we O
consult O
with O
the O
festival O
committee O
, O
what O
was O
successful O
and O
what O
can O
still O
be O
improved O
. O
