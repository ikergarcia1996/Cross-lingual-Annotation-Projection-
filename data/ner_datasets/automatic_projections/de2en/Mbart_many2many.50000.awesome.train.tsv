It O
is O
therefore O
not O
difficult O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
with O
the O
publication O
of O
a O
book O
about O
refugees O

displaced O
persons O
in O
West B-LOC
Germany I-LOC
from O

to O
attract O
attention O
. O

And O
indeed O
there O
are O
hardly O
any O
serious O
scientific O
discussions O
that O
have O
taken O
up O
this O
subject O
so O
far O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
is O
questionable O
whether O
such O
a O
topicality O
must O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
an O
undoubtedly O
imminent O
debate O
to O
deprive O
it O
of O

In O

Albrecht O

to O
adopt O
a O
neutral O
, O
free O
perspective O
from O
guilt O
assignments O
and O
innocence O
confessions O
towards O
a O
policy O
and O
its O
consequences O
, O
which O
led O
to O
the O

of O
the O
Second B-MISC

when O
twelve O

In O
what O
way O
the O
" O

- O
as O
it O
was O
called O
immediately O
after O

still O
with O
a O
pejorative O
side O

1948 O
- O
found O
in O
their O
new O
circumstances O
and O
how O
these O
experiences O
have O
been O
traditional O
over O
the O
next O
decades O
in O
the O
different O
generations O
until O
today O
, O
Lehmann B-PER
demonstrates O
by O
means O
of O
a O
series O
of O
stories O
, O
personal O
records O
, O
diary O
and O
documents O
of O
the O
distributed O
press O
. O

Today O
promoted O
is O
an O
image O
, O
which O
, O
although O
little O
surprising O
, O
but O
in O
its O
composition O
convincing O
readers O
and O
readers O
allows O
the O
refinement O
of O
a O
specific O
kind O
of O
foreign O
experience O
. O

The O
respective O
experiences O
and O
their O
coping O
are O
presented O
quite O
differently O
. O

Certain O
topics O
, O
however O
, O
appear O
again O
and O
again O
: O

Thus O
, O
the O
rape O
of O
German B-MISC
women O
by O
members O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
led O
not O
only O
to O
irreparable O
mental O
disorders O
among O
the O
women O
themselves O
, O
but O
also O
to O
complicated O
marriage O
relationships O
, O
which O
often O
dominated O
the O
life O
of O
entire O
families O
for O
years O
after O
these O
events O
. O

The O
design O
from O
the O
old O
home O
produced O
in O
not O
few O
cases O
forms O
of O
social O
overload O
, O
which O
especially O
in O
close O
village O
communities O
caused O
difficulties O
with O
the O
old O
indigenous O
population O
. O

A O
" O
sentimental O
restraint O
" O
on O
old O
traditions O
and O
customs O
expressed O
how O
incapable O
the O
displaced O
were O
to O
forget O
the O
old O
homeland O
. O

In O
all O
the O
narratives O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
pursuit O
of O
social O
harmony O
has O
been O
guiding O
for O
action O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
creation O
of O
a O
new O
sense O
of O
community O
should O
compensate O
for O
the O
loss O
most O
often O
experienced O
as O
cruel O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
such O
typical O
difficulties O
, O
a O
strength O
of O
the O
book O
is O
to O
highlight O
the O
differences O
in O
the O
experiences O
of O
the O
different O
generations O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
plausible O
that O
the O
generation O
that O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
sixties O
and O
seventies O
wanted O
to O
have O
little O
to O
do O
with O
the O
past O
of O
their O
parents O
who O
had O
been O
expelled O
. O

A O
consciousness O
of O
the O
" O
lost O
homeland O
" O
existed O
; O
however O
, O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
sentimentally O
occupied O
. O

This O
changed O
only O
again O
in O
the O
eighties O
, O
when O
in O
Germany B-LOC
a O
renaissance O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
home O
allowed O
a O
stronger O
reference O
to O
the O
former O
German B-MISC
settlements O
again O
. O

Lehmann B-PER
will O
not O
be O
tired O
in O
describing O
and O
reproducing O
the O
stories O
of O
displaced O
persons O
, O
repeatedly O
pointing O
out O
that O
, O
despite O
radical O
prejudices O
, O
they O
do O
not O
relate O
to O
revanchism O
. O

One O
may O
believe O
the O
author O
, O
who O
understands O
his O
book O
as O
a O
contribution O
to O
the O
understanding O
of O
different O
nations O
, O
when O
he O
calls O
in O
this O
sense O
to O
understand O
the O
old O
homeland O
only O
as O
a O
" O
homeland O
in O
the O
head O
" O
. O

But O
despite O
this O
certainly O
lazy O
attitude O
and O
programming O
, O
the O
many O
reports O
and O
narratives O
leave O
a O
false O
aftertaste O
, O
which O
is O
primarily O
due O
to O
the O
methodology O
of O
German B-MISC
folklore O
. O

History O
, O
as O
written O
in O
this O
book O
, O
is O
reproduced O
primarily O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
those O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

The O
one O
story O
breaks O
down O
into O
many O
stories O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
can O
be O
scientifically O
classified O
exactly O
according O
to O
different O
genres O
. O

For O
example O
, O
success O
stories O
, O
weaknesses O
and O
overwhelming O
stories O
are O
typical O
forms O
of O
telling O
a O
particular O
group O
who O
still O
want O
to O
forget O
their O
initial O
difficulties O
in O
the O
new O
homeland O
. O

An O
overwhelming O
form O
of O
storytelling O
is O
to O
be O
found O
, O
in O
contrast O
, O
among O
women O
who O
have O
become O
victims O
of O
rape O
. O

However O
, O
this O
scientifically O
derived O
classification O
of O
narrative O
types O
remains O
only O
external O
. O

The O
narratives O
themselves O
are O
central O
in O
the O
present O
form O
of O
presentation O
; O
a O
reflection O
on O
them O
and O
thus O
a O
possibility O
of O
evaluation O
and O
arrangement O
remains O
out O
. O

This O
circumstance O
, O
however O
, O
leads O
all O
too O
easily O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
compassionate O
comprehension O
or O
sympathetic O
identification O
with O
the O
affected O
people O
forget O
those O
constellations O
of O
history O
, O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
which O
the O
fraglos O
cruel O
individual O
events O
should O
, O
however O
, O
necessarily O
be O
presented O
. O

Thus O
it O
seems O
quite O
irritating O
, O
for O
example O
, O
when O
it O
is O
reported O
about O
the O
" O
double O
luck O
" O
of O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
from O
Siebenb√ºrgen B-LOC
, O
who O
as O
a O
People B-MISC
's I-MISC
German I-MISC
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
join O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
, O
but O
had O
to O
join O
the O
Waffen B-ORG
- I-ORG
SS I-ORG
; O
who O
was O
thus O
able O
to O
save O
himself O
over O
the O
years O
of O
war O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
remained O
free O
from O
the O
prison O
of O
war O
. O

Leading O
the O
luck O
of O
an O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
in O
front O
of O
your O
eyes O
, O
is O
the O
one O
side O
. O

The O
other O
must O
be O
to O
arrange O
the O
individual O
episodes O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
and O
the O
years O
thereafter O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
an O
objective O
perspective O
can O
be O
taken O
. O

It O
is O
a O
mistake O
to O
assume O
that O
merely O
reproducing O
authentic O
reports O
necessarily O
leads O
to O
an O
appropriate O
view O
of O
history O
. O

Rather O
, O
it O
carries O
the O
danger O
of O
a O
look O
at O
history O
that O
styles O
all O
those O
involved O
to O
their O
victims O
. O

It O
is O
undoubtedly O
necessary O
to O
also O
deal O
with O
the O
victims O
of O
history O
who O
stood O
on O
the O
perpetrator O
's O
side O
. O

In O
doing O
so O
, O
however O
, O
it O
should O
be O
wisely O
avoided O
to O
suggest O
a O
relativeization O
of O
history O
, O
which O
seeks O
to O
confuse O
all O
differences O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
" O
comprehensible O
understanding O
. O
" O

In O
this O
context O
, O
it O
is O
also O
not O
enough O
to O
issue O
programmatic O
slogans O
for O
the O
" O
reconciliation O
of O
all O
cultures O
" O
. O

Rather O
, O
this O
leads O
to O
other O
fundamental O
misunderstandings O
that O
help O
to O
obscure O
crucial O
differences O
. O

This O
confusion O
is O
most O
evident O
at O
Lehmann B-PER
's O
place O
, O
where O
he O
advocates O
a O
" O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
" O
and O
declares O
this O
as O
a O
perspective O
that O
should O
arise O
from O
a O
non O
- O
revanchistic O
immigrant O
perspective O
, O
so O
that O
the O
German B-MISC
solution O
of O
the O
immigrant O
problem O
becomes O
an O
example O
for O
those O
questions O
and O
problems O
that O
arise O
as O
a O
result O
of O
immigration O
movements O
: O

" O
The O
theme O
of O
this O
book O
remains O
current O
: O

The O
question O
, O
how O
individuals O
and O
families O
with O
their O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
in O
our O
country O
find O
a O
new O
home O
, O
in O
which O
memories O
they O
carry O
the O
old O
home O
and O
the O
culture O
of O
the O
region O
of O
origin O
and O
tradition O
, O
how O
they O
maintain O
contact O
with O
the O
first O
home O
. O
" O

In O
the O
equation O
here O
made O
of O
the O
problems O
of O
immigrants O
and O
asylum O
seekers O
as O
well O
as O
their O
respective O
experiences O
of O
foreignness O
, O
the O
fundamental O
difference O
between O
these O
groups O
is O
brought O
to O
the O
table O
. O

After O
all O
, O
a O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
consists O
of O
the O
coexistence O
of O
the O
most O
diverse O
ethnic O
groups O
, O
who O
have O
forcibly O
or O
deliberately O
moved O
to O
Germany B-LOC
or O
other O
countries O
of O
Europe B-LOC
. O

The O
foreign O
experience O
of O
these O
groups O
, O
however O
, O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
fundamentally O
different O
from O
that O
of O
the O
settlers O
of O
the O
1940s O
or O
that O
of O
their O
children O
decades O
later O
. O

The O
latter O
have O
proven O
to O
identify O
with O
Germany B-LOC
despite O
the O
losses O
of O
the O
" O
old O
homeland O

east O
, O
" O
have O
built O
up O
a O
national O
consciousness O
due O
to O
their O
ethnic O
affiliation O
. O

Such O
identification O
is O
neither O
possible O
nor O
desirable O
for O
immigrants O
. O

While O
for O
immigrants O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
homogeneous O
nation O
state O
was O
decisive O
, O
for O
asylum O
seekers O
and O
immigrants O
today O
it O
is O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
heterogeneous O
nation O
state O
. O

A O
focus O
on O
subjective O
feelings O
, O
as O
is O
done O

she O

But O
, O
after O

she O
felt O

Andrea B-PER
started O
to O

more O

It O
was O
no O

in O
her O

at O
some O
point O
the O

Andrea B-PER
had O

addicted O

her O
whole O

was O
foreign O
to O
her O
at O

That O
she O
was O
sick O

she O
did O

know O
at O
the O
time O

Only O
when O
she O
read O
a O
diet O
book O
one O
day O
, O
she O
noticed O
it O
. O

A O
devout O
woman O
was O
described O
- O
and O
in O
this O
story O
Andrea B-PER
recognized O
herself O
again O
. O

At O
that O
moment O
it O
was O
clear O
to O
her O
that O
she O
had O
to O
do O
something O
about O
her O
suffering O
. O

So O
Andrea B-PER
took O
the O
initiative O
and O
applied O
to O
a O
clinic O
for O
addicts O
in O
Allg√§u B-LOC
. O

A O
few O
weeks O
later O
, O
she O
left O
her O
husband O
and O
children O
for O
three O
months O
of O
therapy O
. O

The O
relatives O
warned O
her O
to O
be O
a O
rhinoceros O
mother O
. O

For O
Andrea B-PER
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
: O

" O
I O
can O
only O
be O
a O
good O
mother O
if O
I O
'm O
doing O
well O
for O
myself O

" O

When O
Andrea B-PER

herself O
on O
the O
first O
day O
in O
the O

, O
she O
said O
: O

" O
My O
name O

Andrea B-PER

eat O
too O
much O
, O
but O
otherwise O
have O
no O

" O

Everyone O
laughed O
, O
and O
soon O
she O
also O
knew O
why O
. O
" O

I O
had O
suppressed O
my O
problems O
until O
the O
therapy O
. O
" O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
Andrea B-PER

not O

her O

Against O
the O
loss O
of O
utopia O
in O
sociology O
: O

An O
incitement O
to O
unrest O
in O
the O
Elven O
Tower O

The O
sociology O
does O
not O
without O
reason O
draw O
the O
suspicion O
of O
the O
high O
stakes O
on O
itself O
. O

Because O
it O
claims O
nothing O
less O
than O
the O
whole O
of O
society O
as O
its O
specific O
subject O
area O
. O

What O
a O
miracle O
that O
the O
society O
that O
was O
so O
targeted O
reacted O
with O
mistrust O
to O
the O
acquisition O
by O
sociology O
. O

Until O
the O
Adenauer O
period O
, O
the O
publicly O
respected O
lady O
society O
felt O
most O
embarrassed O
by O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
becoming O
third O
sociology O
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
the O
turbulent O
political O
times O
of O
the O
late O
sixties O
that O
she O
succumbed O
to O
her O
stormy O
pressures O
. O

Encouragingly O
, O
the O
society B-ORG
of I-ORG
sociology I-ORG
fell O
into O
the O
arms O
. O

This O
yes O
- O
word O
has O
led O
to O
a O
covenant O
for O
life O
, O
but O
it O
has O
become O
nothing O
more O
than O
an O
incessant O
love O
relationship O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
enthusiasm O
of O
which O
the O
expectation O
of O
this O
young O
social O
science O
at O
the O
peak O
of O
its O
academic O
spread O
was O
sustained O
. O

The O
conviction O
that O
one O
associated O
with O
that O
sophisticated O
goal O
of O
knowledge O
was O
to O
formulate O
a O
theory O
of O
society O
as O
a O
whole O
that O
should O
be O
both O
critical O
and O
practically O
transformative O
. O

Are O
we O
, O
therefore O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
process O
in O
which O
the O
utopian O
energies O
have O
completely O
revived O
, O
which O
had O
been O
invested O
in O
the O
massive O
undertaking O
of O
a O
revolution O
of O
all O
outdated O
working O
and O
living O
conditions O
to O
be O
effected O
by O
enlightenment O
and O
criticism O
? O

If O
asked O
differently O
: O

How O
can O
we O
regain O
the O
attraction O
of O
sociology O
as O
a O
changeling O
force O
in O
reality O
, O
which O
interrupted O
it O
in O
the O
course O
of O
its O
" O
maturation O
process O
" O
to O
normal O
science O
? O

For O
the O
utopian O
loss O
of O
sociology O
there O
are O
three O
main O
reasons O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
the O
utopia O
itself O
that O
has O
become O
modest O
from O
the O
experience O
of O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
great O
visionary O
promises O
pushed O
forward O
historically O
until O
recently O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
increasingly O
concrete O
utopian O
challenge O
has O
arisen O
through O
the O
simple O
list O
of O
the O
realization O
of O
utopian O
ideals O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
historical O
situation O
has O
assumed O
a O
gravity O
that O
allows O
any O
longing O
projection O
of O
a O
completely O
different O
one O
in O
the O
forthcoming O
morning O
merely O
as O
an O
apocalypse O
. O

The O
desire O
images O
at O
the O
origin O
of O
modernity O
have O
been O
reshaped O
in O
the O
critical O
tradition O
of O
social O
teaching O
to O
the O
concrete O
utopia O
of O
the O
real O
history O
of O
progressive O
bourgeois O
emancipation O
. O

The O
stage O
leads O
from O
the O
fictional O
future O
paintings O
of O
a O
Morus B-PER
, O
Campanella B-PER
and O
Bacon B-PER
to O
the O
technical O
and O
early O
socialist O
utopianism O
of O
an O
Owen B-PER
, O
Saint B-PER
- I-PER
Simon I-PER
, O
Fourier B-PER
and O
Proudhon B-PER
. O

Marx B-PER
polemized O
against O
these O
utopian O
socialists O
with O
all O
sharpness O
, O
who O
warned O
them O
to O
be O
mere O
dreamers O
. O

He O
himself O
, O
like O
so O
many O
, O
puts O
the O
utopia O
from O
the O
head O
to O
the O
feet O
and O
comes O
to O
the O
matter O
materialistically O
: O

In O
Communism O
utopia O
and O
reality O
merge O
, O
namely O
as O
the O
society O
of O
free O
producers O
, O
as O
material O
abundance O
and O
as O
social O
relations O
transparent O
for O
all O
members O
of O
society O
. O

However O
, O
this O
concreteization O
of O
utopia O
has O
not O
led O
to O
the O
paradise O
promised O
. O

For O
, O
as O
we O
read O
in O
Horkheimer B-LOC
's I-LOC

note O
from O
the O

in O

, O
the O

of O
the O

The O
shock O
of O
those O

, O
such O
as O
the O
reactor O
accidents O
that O
endanger O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
species O
, O
has O
brought O
sociology O
out O
of O
the O
sleep O
of O
dawn O
of O
progress O
. O

This O
awakening O
finds O
its O
current O
expression O
in O
the O
burning O
term O
of O
the O
" O

, O
whose O
secret O

consists O
in O
making O

This O
hope O
of O
a O
" O
reflexive O
modernisation O
" O
by O
Ulrich B-PER
Beck I-PER
is O
by O
no O
means O
new O
. O

In O
order O
to O
avoid O
the O
foreseeable O
catastrophe O
, O
already O
leading O
sociologists O
of O
the O
Weimar B-MISC
era I-MISC
such O
as O
Max B-PER
Weber I-PER
and O
Karl B-PER
Mannheim I-PER
argued O
that O
the O
reality O
was O
closer O
to O
the O
concrete O
Utopian O
. O

And O
in O
fact O
: O

The O
rule O
of O
law O
, O
democratic O
self O
- O
determination O
and O
material O
welfare O
are O
nothing O
more O
than O
an O
enchanted O
form O
of O
the O
realization O
of O
that O
utopia O
that O
has O
long O
been O
brought O
from O
heaven O
to O
earth O
: O

Everyone O
produces O
according O
to O
his O

, O
everyone O

according O
to O

. O

This O
secularized O
ideal O
of O
the O
right O
of O

to O
everything O
, O
however O
, O
is O
currently O
being O

This O
formula O

with O
which O
the O

Claus B-PER

entered O
the O
exit O
from O
such O
almost O
objective O
processes O
as O

, O

. O

To O

however O
, O
is O
not O
much O
more O
than O
a O
residual O
hope O
to O
avoid O
the O
continuing O

resulting O
from O
a O
generalization O
of O
the O
principle O
of O
" O
free O

for O
free O

" O
through O
inconvenience O
and O
stagnation O
. O

Does O
this O
utopia O
of O
voluntary O
on O
- O
the O
- O
ground O
walking O
not O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
succumbing O
to O
the O
temptation O
of O
the O
omnipotence O
of O
the O
contemporary O
? O

By O
relaxing O
the O
critical O
power O
of O
utopian O
thought O
in O
enlightenment O
science O
, O
the O
dimension O
of O
historical O
sense O
- O
making O
in O
the O
horizon O
of O
historical O
objective O
perspectives O
is O
diminished O
in O
the O
social O
self O
- O
thematization O
. O

This O
vacuum O
is O
not O
only O
a O
breeding O
ground O
for O
ideologies O
such O
as O
the O
posthistoric O
one O
, O
but O
this O
utopianism O
also O
promotes O
the O
fixation O
on O
alternative O
programs O
such O
as O
fundamentalism O
, O
regionalism O
, O
and O
feminism O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
memory O
of O
what O
is O
unspoken O
in O
utopian O
thinking O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
that O
utopian O
forward O
- O
thinking O
that O
strikes O
the O
spark O
that O
can O
light O
the O
light O
that O
accompanies O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
better O
society O
. O

Contrary O
to O
the O
risks O
of O
a O
risk O
society O
, O
a O
disciplined O
, O
organized O
scientific O
enterprise O
is O
objectively O
overwhelmed O
. O

For O
the O
growing O
destructive O
potentials O
in O
nature O
and O
society O
generated O
by O
the O
individual O
sciences O
themselves O
have O
their O
reason O
not O
least O
also O
in O
that O
the O
subjects O
are O
merely O
navel O
- O
gazing O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
remain O
in O
their O
ivory O
towers O
. O

In O
this O
compulsory O
multi O
- O
disciplinary O
cooperation O
between O
the O
natural O
sciences O
, O
the O
humanities O
and O
the O
social O
sciences O
, O
science O
assumes O
a O
special O
responsibility O
from O
society O
due O
to O
its O
object O
- O
relatedness O
to O
the O
totality O
of O
social O
science O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
sociology O
has O
the O
self O
- O
critical O
task O
of O
returning O
to O
its O
own O
home O
and O
acting O
contagious O
through O
this O
exemplaryness O
. O

Only O
as O
a O
" O
house O
of O
open O
doors O
" O
with O
internal O
plurality O
it O
allows O
a O
process O
of O
combining O
diverse O
methods O
and O
theories O
. O

The O
cognitive O
identity O
of O
sociology O
is O
not O
in O
any O
way O
jeopardized O
by O
this O
openness O
, O
as O
the O
discipline O
has O
stabilized O
organizationally O
and O
its O
academic O
reputation O
seems O
to O
be O
secured O
. O

Its O
status O
as O
a O
science O
of O
interpretation O
requires O
the O
practice O
of O
extreme O
tolerance O
towards O
competing O
paradigms O
, O
different O
methodical O
approaches O
and O
the O
divergent O
interpretation O
of O
social O
facts O
. O

Because O
social O
analyses O
can O
not O
operate O
with O
an O
objectiveistic O
claim O
to O
knowledge O
. O

Rather O
, O
societal O
theory O
is O
convinced O
by O
the O
formation O
of O
argumentation O
, O
that O
is O
, O
by O
empirical O
acuity O
and O
interpretative O
plausibility O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
future O
of O
sociology O
lies O
in O
establishing O
a O
unity O
of O
originally O
divergent O
traditions O
: O

the O
empirical O
method O
of O
knowledge O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
the O
humanistic O
hermeneutics O
on O
the O
other O
. O

This O
principle O
of O
tolerance O
at O
home O
implies O
, O
moreover O
, O
a O
direct O
connection O
to O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
same O
street O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
strict O
cooperation O
of O
sociology O
with O
other O
social O
sciences O
, O
if O
it O
does O
not O
wish O
to O
give O
up O
its O
great O
aim O
of O
knowledge O
, O
which O
Horkheimer O
believes O
consists O
in O
formulating O
a O
theory O
of O
the O
historical O
course O
of O
the O
epoch O
. O

This O
gigantic O
research O
program O
is O
only O
feasible O
if O
sociology O
becomes O
the O
carrier O
of O
a O
communication O
between O
the O
fields O
of O
history O
, O
economics O
, O
anthropology O
, O
ethnology O
and O
psychology O
, O
among O
others O
, O
which O
jointly O
engage O
in O
a O
philosophical O
fundamental O
reflection O
, O
are O
ready O
for O
a O
continuous O
exchange O
of O
individual O
scientific O
advances O
and O
link O
the O
empirical O
research O
efforts O
systematically O
with O
theory O
formation O
. O

This O
orientation O
of O
the O
social O
sciences O
towards O
a O
historically O
and O
empirically O
sustained O
theory O
of O
social O
science O
to O
be O
developed O
through O
research O
cooperation O
is O
only O
a O
first O
step O
. O

A O
second O
must O
follow O
. O

For O
the O
increasingly O
specialized O
social O
sciences O
the O
subject O
of O
their O
research O
efforts O
breaks O
down O
not O
only O
between O
the O
fingers O
, O
but O
the O
meaning O
of O
their O
teaching O
and O
research O
is O
limited O
to O
the O
workload O
of O
the O
shoemaker O
, O
who O
stays O
at O
his O
leash O
, O
may O
the O
water O
even O
stand O
to O
his O
neck O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
future O
perspective O
of O
the O
humanities O
and O
social O
sciences O
lies O
in O
the O
emerging O
coalition O
of O
the O
humanities O
. O

According O
to O
the O
American B-MISC
historian O
Robert B-PER
Darnton I-PER
, O
a O
novel O
faculty O
configuration O
, O
which O
in O
consequence O
includes O
a O
dissolution O
of O
traditional O
faculties O
and O
departments O
, O
leads O
to O
an O
innovation O
spurt O
: O

The O
one O
- O
dimensionality O
of O
cause O
and O
event O
research O
is O
overcome O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
realistic O
understanding O
of O
the O
symbolic O
cultural O
system O
as O
the O
common O
reference O
point O
of O
the O
humanities O
. O

Let O
us O
take O
together O
: O

Sociology O
must O
firstly O
recognize O
the O
status O
of O
an O
empirical O
, O
comprehensible O
and O
critical O
social O
science O
, O
not O
only O
for O
itself O
, O
but O
also O
to O
exploit O
its O
character O
as O
a O
multi O
- O
paradigm O
science O
productively O
for O
itself O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
project O
requires O
a O
restructured O
societal O
theory O
of O
interdisciplinary O
cooperation O
among O
the O
various O
social O
sciences O
. O

Finally O
, O
thirdly O
, O
the O
science O
of O
society O
, O
due O
to O
its O
perspective O
on O
the O
whole O
of O
human O
life O
, O
is O
best O
suited O
to O
demonstrate O
a O
general O
interest O
of O
humanity O
in O
the O
dangerous O
work O
of O
the O
self O
- O
perpetuating O
sorcerer O
teachers O
of O
the O
technical O
- O
scientific O
civilization O
, O
the O
independent O
individual O
sciences O
with O
their O
particularistic O
rationalities O
. O

The O
present O
task O
of O
sociology O
is O
to O
bring O
the O
sciences O
, O
whose O
differentiation O
is O
irreversible O
, O
to O
the O
common O
denominator O
of O
a O
multi O
- O
disciplinary O
discourse O
, O
which O
seeks O
to O
solve O
a O
binding O
question O
for O
all O
: O

how O
to O
prevent O
the O
disaster O
. O

The O
processing O
of O
this O
existential O
question O
certainly O
does O
not O
succeed O
as O
the O
genius O
of O
a O
researcher O
or O
a O
discipline O
, O
but O
is O
only O
conceivable O
as O
a O
joint O
work O
of O
all O
sciences O
. O

In O
view O
of O
this O
, O
the O
science O
of O
enlightenment O
is O
quite O
the O
protagonist O
of O
a O
utopian O
program O
: O

the O
overcoming O
of O
discipline O
boundaries O
. O

The O
indifference O
of O
university O
sciences O
to O
each O
other O
is O
scientifically O
irresponsible O
in O
view O
of O
the O
world O
's O
dangers O
and O
their O
complex O
interdependencies O
and O
is O
as O
outdated O
as O
the O

The O
melody O
" O
If O

his O
own O
, O
the O
whole O

" O
is O
an O
extremely O
dangerous O
punchline O

The O

the O

A O
common O
characteristic O
of O
these O

beetles O
is O
that O
the O
eagle O
is O
depicted O
with O
a O
peacock O
crown O
made O
of O
extended O
wings O
. O

This O
mixture O
of O
eagle O
and O
peacock O
is O
based O
on O
a O
deeply O
Christian O
meaning O
: O

The O
eagle O
symbolizes O
the O
resurrection O
and O
ascension O
of O
Christ B-PER
, O
the O
dove O
eternal O
life O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
this O
crowned O
bird O
was O

regarded O
as O
an O
imperial O
symbol O
of O
sovereignty O
and O
a O
predecessor O
of O
the O
Prussian O
Reichsadler B-MISC
is O
also O
an O

arrangement O
. O

His O
body O
form O
in O

view O

only O
the O
head O
in O

, O
obviously O
goes O
back O

10th O
century O

Stylistically O

the O
most O
beautiful O

of O

by O
whom O

made O

can O
only O
be O
presumed O

Some O
of O
it O

to O
Byzantine B-MISC

who O
may O
have O

singing O

i.e. O

pieces O
for O

A O
program O
with O
music O
by O
Johann B-PER
Sebastian I-PER
Bach I-PER
is O
planned O
for O
the O
Advent O

These O

Many O
have O
so O

fun O
playing O
with O

that O
they O
also O

once O

" O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
Kantorin O
has O
her O
own O
string O
orchestra O
is O
unusual O
. O

To O
church O
concerts O
usually O
the O
musicians O
are O
bought O
together O

which O
you O
just O
need O

Or O
you O
can O
hire O
a O
whole O

This O
is O
expensive O

not O
a O

" O

The O
orchestra O
tastes O
just O

very O

such O
as O
the O
German B-MISC
Requiem O
by O

with O

To O

a O
split O

Your O

In O

I O
do O

number O

demands O
. O

As O
the O
head O
of O
the O
conference O
, O
Professor O
Joachim B-PER
Wolfram I-PER
Dudenhausen I-PER
from O
the O
Rudolf B-ORG
Virchow I-ORG
Clinic I-ORG
of O
the O
Freie B-ORG
Universit√§t I-ORG
Berlin I-ORG
, O
explained O
, O
the O
in O
principle O
harmless O
, O
but O
costly O
test O
, O
if O
it O
provides O
clues O
to O
genetic O
damage O
such O
as O
neural O
tube O
defects O
or O
for O
trisomies O
( O
such O
as O
the O
former O
Mongolism B-MISC
called O
Down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
) O
, O
further O
extensive O
and O
for O
the O
woman O
and O
the O
unborn O
not O
entirely O
harmless O
examinations O
after O
themselves O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
amniocentesis O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
interventions O
, O
according O
to O
the O
consultants O
, O
are O
unnecessary O
and O
should O
be O
avoided O
for O
pregnant O
women O
. O

As O
the O
triple O
diagnosis O
is O
handled O
today O
, O
it O
too O
often O
provides O
clues O
to O
a O
genetic O
risk O
that O
can O
not O
be O
confirmed O
with O
the O
amniocentesis O
. O

These O
shortcomings O
, O
according O
to O
Professor O
Dudenhausen B-PER
, O
have O
less O
to O
do O
with O
the O
difficulties O
of O
laboratory O
regulations O
, O
with O
which O
biochemically O
three O
childhood O
substances O
are O
measured O
in O
the O
mother O
's O
blood O
( O
Alpha O
- O
Fetoprotein O
, O
Choriongonadotropine O
and O
√ñstriol O
) O
. O

Often O
, O
the O
test O
's O
testability O
is O
impaired O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
on O
the O
medical O
side O
, O
the O
exact O
age O
of O
the O
unborn O
is O
often O
not O
determined O
before O
the O
blood O
is O
taken O
and O
the O
blood O
values O
when O
the O
child O
is O
older O
than O
suspected O
do O
not O
reflect O
an O
existing O
risk O
. O

The O
experts O
therefore O
require O
that O
the O
test O
be O
performed O
only O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
age O
determination O
of O
the O
fete O
by O
means O
of O
ultrasound O
. O

As O
Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
added O
, O
further O
consultation O
of O
pregnant O
women O
is O
also O
essential O
. O

It O
should O
be O
made O
clear O
to O
the O
future O
mothers O
that O
the O
test O
, O
for O
example O
, O
can O
only O
detect O
a O
Down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
in O
six O
out O
of O
ten O
cases O
and O
generally O
only O
a O
small O
part O
of O
all O
possible O
inheritance O
damage O
is O
detected O
. O

Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
: O

" O
We O
can O
not O
give O
a O
warranty O
for O
the O
birth O
of O
a O
healthy O
child O
. O
" O

The O
feasibility O
of O
the O
test O
under O
accompanying O
advice O
and O
ultrasound O
control O
had O
to O
be O
determined O
first O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
several O
series O
of O
tests O
are O
conducted O
at O
German B-MISC
clinics O
, O
such O
as O
at O
the O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
G√∂ttingen I-ORG
, O
where O
so O
far O
more O
than O
10,000 O
mothers O
are O
being O
tested O
. O

For O
concern O
regarding O
the O
possible O
consequences O
of O
abortion O
, O
the O
consultants O
also O
consider O
that O
the O
test O
is O
only O
applicable O
relatively O
late O
, O
between O
the O
15th O
and O
18th O
weeks O
of O
pregnancy O
. O

Here O
they O
hope O
that O
the O
new O
development O
of O
a O
blood O
test O
, O

only O

In O

the O

came O
to O
the O
conclusion O

was O

are O
called O
in O
the O

, O
were O
initially O
also O
raised O
by O
the O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
it O
was O
the O
rule O
that O
two O
- O
engine O

had O
to O
set O
up O
their O
routes O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
, O
in O

, O
they O
could O
reach O
the O
next O

within O
60 O

at O
the O

. O

This O
meant O
that O
routes O
such O
as O
the O
North B-MISC

route I-MISC
were O
initially O
largely O
closed O
to O
two O
- O

jets O
such O
as O
the O
Airbusse B-MISC
or O
the O
Boeing-767 B-MISC
: O

The O
necessary O
routes O
over O
Greenland B-LOC

Newfoundland O
cost O

time O

made O

flight O
operations O
impossible O

Under O
pressure O
from O
manufacturers O
and O

, O
who O
promised O
economic O
benefits O
from O
the O
cost O
- O

use O
of O

for O

has O
arisen O

Under O
the O
rubric O

the O

has O
to O
inform O

the O

, O
you O

almost O
11,000 O

statistically O

even O
20,000 O

go O
by O
until O

Beyond O
these O

, O
it O
also O
remains O
true O
that O

An O
old O
Frankfurt B-MISC
question O
about O
this O
sculpture O
by O
the O
Belgian O
sculptor O
Constantin B-PER
Meunier I-PER
( O
1831 O
- O
1905 O
) O
is O
as O
follows O
: O

" O
What O
does O
he O
actually O
imagine O
? O

The O
right O
leg O
of O
course O
! O
" O

And O
what O
else O
? O

The O
" O
Debardeur O
" O
( O
dock O
worker O
) O
, O
as O
the O
figure O
created O
in O
1883 O
is O
called O
, O
stands O
with O
both O
legs O
in O
a O
crisis O
of O
art O
, O
to O
whose O
authenticity O
and O
social O
claim O
artists O
like O
Meunier B-PER
or O
his O
far O
more O
famous O
companion O
van B-PER
Gogh I-PER
have O
walked O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
19th O
century O
. O

The O
nuts O
of O
youth O
, O
the O
rigid O
ideals O
of O
neo O
- O
classicism O
and O
the O
salon O
life O
of O
Boh√®me O
seemed O
inadequate O
to O
the O
human O
reality O
they O
experienced O
, O
to O
the O
lies O
. O

Meunier B-PER
's I-PER
response O
to O
this O
was O
the O
radical O
aversion O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
, O
to O
the O
modeling O
of O
workers O
' O
figures O
. O

In O
this O
he O
was O
not O
concerned O
with O
the O
depiction O
of O
the O
misery O
in O
which O
the O
proletariat O
had O
fallen O
through O
the O
then O
still O
not O
socially O
acceptable O
industrialization O
. O

He O
created O
realistic O
workers O
figures O
that O
embody O
unbroken O
strength O
, O
pride O
and O
dignity O
with O
a O
certain O
pathos O
. O

Apollo B-PER
as O
a O
prophet O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
naturalism O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
classical O
antiquity O
. O

Such O
sculpture O
clearly O
took O
party O
to O
the O
emerging O
working O
class O
movement O
and O
fell O
into O
a O
destructive O
, O
risky O
contradiction O
to O
the O
contemporary O
art O
view O
. O

Meunier B-PER
was O
wrongly O
accused O
of O
equating O
his O
heroes O
of O
work O
with O
admittedly O
similar O
standpoints O
of O
Nazi B-MISC
times I-MISC
or O

Schmidt B-PER

therefore O

It O
says O
that O
with O
the O
sewage O
treatment O

is O
only O
a O
rumor O

and O
the O
wastewater O
is O
now O
only O
directed O
to O
the O
neighbouring O

where O
the O
fishing O
village O

We O

there O
anyway O

the O
fish O
tastes O
more O
fader O
at O

, O
and O
the O
waiters O
became O
more O
and O
more O
unfriendly O
and O
once O
even O
really O
disgusting O
, O
when O
Heinz B-PER
got O
goat O
- O
meat O
- O
sweeping O
languste O
and O
just O
wanted O
to O
pay O
accordingly O
. O

This O
time O
we O
have O
often O
been O
in O
" O
La B-LOC
Matalla I-LOC
" O
, O
the O
northern O
pebble O
of O
our O
bay O
, O
which O
they O
have O
only O
now O
built O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
cute O
, O
small O
bungalow O
village O
with O
diving O
school O
, O
disco O
, O
two O
restaurants O
and O
a O
shopping O

. O

Earlier O
there O
stood O
some O
shameful O
barracks O
, O
which O
they O
, O
together O
with O
a O
forest O
and O
some O
rocks O
that O
were O
in O
the O
way O
, O
threw O
away O
and O
then O
kicked O
the O
whole O
rock O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
San B-LOC
Felipiano I-LOC
into O
the O
sea O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
these O
nervous O
, O
ugly O
seabirds O
that O
used O
to O
nest O
there O
have O
also O
disappeared O
. O

Apparently O
they O
should O
be O
very O
rare O
, O
but O
last O
year O
there O
were O
still O
enough O
of O
them O
to O
bring O
me O
to O
sleep O
with O
their O
circle O
three O
nights O
in O
a O
row O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
they O
have O
enclosed O
the O
whole O
bay O
around O
the O
" O
Plaza B-LOC
Paraiso I-LOC
" O
, O
so O
that O
now O
this O
whole O
bunch O
no O
longer O
comes O
to O
the O
beach O
to O
sell O
any O
kind O
of O
stuff O
or O
crouching O
. O

It O
had O
become O
more O
and O
more O
, O
as O
it O
is O
said O
, O
because O
unemployment O
in O
the O
region O
is O
supposed O
to O
lie O
at O
over O
40 O
percent O
. O

So O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
that O
. O

There O
is O
truly O
enough O
to O
do O
in O
our O
holiday O
bay O
, O
especially O
for O
people O
who O
are O
not O
too O
fine O

Although O

already O
pretty O

I O
have O
read O
that O
they O
are O
still O
looking O
for O
people O

Also O
with O
the O
faster O
way O
of O
creating O
the O
cans O

that O
lie O
around O
many O

, O
you O
could O
employ O
some O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
believe O
how O
linguistically O
impaired O
most O

are O
here O

With O
the O
guy O
who O
used O
to O
run O

, O
the O
understanding O
was O
so O
difficult O
that O
at O
the O
end O

we O
had O
no O

No O
wonder O
that O
the O

made O
pleite O

A O

Johann B-PER

took O

Johann B-PER

no O

In O

: O

From O
the O
modest O
estate O
became O
a O
water O
castle O
, O
which O
should O
withstand O
a O

It O

at O
an O
amazingly O
high O

The O

is O
of O

It O
meets O
the O
needs O
of O
a O
solid O

ideally O
. O

The O

proves O
to O
be O
quite O
stiff O
on O
certain O
short O
ground O
inflections O
, O
but O
without O
having O
to O
be O
classified O

The O

as O
you O
wish O

Of O

the O

are O
also O
a O

no O

But O
here O
no O

up O

this O

: O

Thanks O
to O
high O
technical O
effort O
, O
the O
Carina B-MISC
engine I-MISC
with O
its O
strongly O
grinded O

runs O
safely O

therefore O
comes O
to O
significantly O
lower O

which O
were O
taken O
out O

even O

registered O
. O

Even O

the O

the O

can O
do O
this O
. O

And O
this O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
Toyota B-MISC

with O
this O
cultivated O
running O
, O
elastic O
and O

sufficiently O
powerful O
Magermix B-MISC

In O

can O
no O

devalued O
with O

in O
the O
case O

What O
actually O
happened O
for O
the O
first O
attempts O
of O
this O

concept O
- O
excessive O

- O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
topic O
, O
according O
to O
data O
presented O
by O
Toyota B-ORG
today O
. O

The O
latest O
generation O
Magermix B-MISC
Carina I-MISC
not O
only O
meets O
the O
strict O
US B-MISC
standard I-MISC
, O
which O
covers O
speed O
peaks O
up O
to O
around O
90 O
km O
/ O

anyway O
, O
but O
also O
the O
new O
ECE B-MISC
exhaust I-MISC
test I-MISC
cycle I-MISC
, O
which O
up O
to O
120 O

requires O
safe O
compliance O
with O
US B-MISC
values I-MISC
and O
this O
over O
a O
runtime O
of O
80 O
000 O
kilometers O
. O

This O
gives O
rise O
to O
a O
new O
offer O
for O
the O
environmentally O
responsible O
car O
buyers O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
because O
the O
simple O
rule O
still O
applies O
, O
that O
every O
litre O
of O
fuel O
that O
is O
not O
burned O
is O
the O
best O
contribution O
to O
environmental O
protection O
. O

The O
modern O
diesel O
engine O
will O
undoubtedly O
receive O
a O
new O
competition O
with O
this O
Toyota B-MISC
concept I-MISC
for O
gasoline O
engines O
, O
because O
its O
previous O
consumption O
advantage O
shrinks O
at O
such O
consumption O
behaviour O
in O
the O
usual O
everyday O
traffic O
almost O
to O
zero O
. O

This O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
will O
certainly O
encourage O
diesel O
engineers O
to O
make O
new O
efforts O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Toyota B-MISC
engineers I-MISC
must O
be O
certified O
: O

As O
consistently O
as O
it O
has O
been O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
no O
one O
has O
so O

For O

so O
answers O
from B-PER

simply O
: O

1662 O
, O
he O
stayed O
in O
various O
places O

When O

Curiously O
: O

So O
bright O
the O
past O
of O
the O
city O
through O
Lersner B-PER
's I-PER
work O
stands O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O

, O
so O
dark O
is O
the O
knowledge O
about O

himself O
- O
at O
least O
until O
the O
time O
when O
he O
came O
back O

That O
he O
spent O
his O
youth O
abroad O
, O
on O

can O
only O
conclude O
a O
remark O
in O

: O

Dr. O
Eduard B-PER

in O

in O

paper O
for O

Frankfurt B-ORG

time O
accordingly O
, O
in O
France B-LOC
" O
to O
devote O
himself O
to O
legal O
studies O
. O

However O
, O
Lersner B-PER
was O
born O
into O
a O
Marburg B-MISC
and O
Kassel B-MISC
family O
of O
lawyers O
, O
who O
were O
nobled O
by O
Charles B-PER
V I-PER
in O

, O
received O
in O
1566 O
by O
the O
Patriziergesellschaft B-ORG
Alten I-ORG
- O
Limpurg O
and O
raised O
to O
the O
state O
of O
free O
reign O
about O
100 O
years O
later O
. O

At O
the O
age O
of O
34 O
, O
Lersner O
married O
Anna B-PER
Rosine I-PER
Steffan I-PER

her O
early O
death O
- O

Anna B-PER
Sybilla I-PER

This O
second O
marriage O
led O
to O
long O
- O
standing O
conflicts O
with O
the O
Old B-PER
Limpurgers I-PER
, O
who O
had O
played O
a O
leading O
role O
in O
the O
city O
government O
since O
the O
15th O
century O
. O

In O
1715 O
he O
was O
elected O
to O
the O
city O
council O
- O
due O
to O
his O
" O
decisive O
abilities O
" O
. O

Three O
years O
later O
he O
also O
found O
a O
recording O
with O
the O
Old B-PER
Limpurgern I-PER
. O

In O
1721 O
Lersner B-PER
took O
over O
the O
post O
of O
a O
younger O
mayor O
. O

But O
in O
addition O
to O
all O
his O
office O
duties O
, O
he O
had O
time O
to O
diligently O
continue O
collecting O
materials O
for O
a O
second O
Chronicle O
Band O
. O

In O
1723 O
he O
became O
a O
clerk O
and O
held O
for O
three O
years O
- O
until O
his O
death O
on O
29 O
December O
1732 O
- O
the O
noble O
office O
of O
an O
elderly O

its O
significance O

It O
became O
clearer O

Heidemarie B-PER

read O
from O

modern O
Indian B-MISC
women O

novel O
" O
Anaro B-MISC

by O
Marijul B-PER
Bhagat I-PER
, O
which O
the O
couple O
Pandey B-PER
together O
translated O
from O
Indian B-MISC
to O
German B-MISC
. O

Here O
the O
Indian B-MISC
everyday O
life O
was O
at O
the O
center O
: O

Anaro B-PER
, O
the O
hero O
of O
the O
novel O
, O
works O
as O
a O
maid O
, O
lives O
in O
the O
slums O
and O
has O
to O
take O
care O
of O
her O
little O
daughter O
, O
who O
the O
father O
does O
not O
take O
care O
of O
. O

But O
the O
insight O
into O
Indian B-MISC
everyday O
life O
remained O
short O
and O
a O
little O
superficial O
- O
especially O
because O
the O
audience O
probably O
lacked O
background O
information O
. O

So O
from O
the O
evening O
over O
India B-LOC
was O
finally O
a O

the O

" O
admits O
chairman O
Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
unapologetically O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Hanau B-MISC
model O
builders O
place O
great O
value O
on O
a O
fine O
difference O
: O

In O
any O
case O
, O
they O
do O
not O
want O
to O
claim O
to O
pursue O
their O
leisure O
activities O
with O
bias O
. O

That O
would O
hardly O
be O
the O
right O
word O
to O
describe O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
bass O
players O
and O
craftsmen O
. O

When O
the O
men O
( O
whose O
domain O
the O
model O
building O
is O
still O
) O
enthusiastically O
tell O
of O
technical O
details O
, O
proudly O
perform O
their O
little O
miracles O
or O
follow O
the O
tracks O
of O
a O
model O

with O
the O
remote O

in O
the O

banned O
, O
this O
has O
rather O
something O
delightfully O
creepy O
. O

Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
refers O
to O
Hanau B-MISC

model O

as O
" O
individuals O
who O
have O
come O
together O
through O
a O

" O
. O

Thirty O

also O
belong O
to O
the O

which O
has O
a O
total O
of O
about O
100 O

. O

They O
are O
supervised O
by O
adults O
according O
to O
the O
individuality O
claim O
individually O
in O
the O
form O
of O
" O
smaller O
partnerships O
" O
while O
crafting O
. O

Two O
" O
groups O
" O
have O
formed O
in O
the O

which O
has O
existed O
since O

: O

the O

captain O
who O
wants O
to O
relax O
while O

On O

he O

: O

Height O

With O

Unlike O

the O

" O

In O
the O

, O
explains O
Pongratz B-PER
. O

Flying O
is O
a O
chapter O
in O
itself O
anyway O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
it O
is O
not O

The O

the O

" O
very O

" O

from O

they O
think O
life O
is O
over O
for O
them O
already O
, O
" O
said O
the O
translator O
and O
added O
: O

" O
Perhaps O
, O
because O
in O
socialist O
society O
already O
very O
early O
determined O
the O

clear O

on O

however O
, O
is O
not O
only O
a O
special O
Russian B-MISC

demonstrated O
by O
the O

predominantly O

The O

The O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
made O
an O
important O
contribution O
to O
the O
consideration O
of O
the O
interests O
of O
people O
and O
the O
environment O
by O
developing O
principles O
for O
the O
resettlement O

of O
displaced O
persons O

others O
affected O
and O
the O
environmental O
compatibility O
of O
such O
projects O
for O
projects O
financed B-MISC
by O
the O
World O

Similarly O
, O
the O
Government O
of O
India B-LOC
has O
developed O
a O
comprehensive O
system O
for O
reducing O
environmental O
damage O
through O

Despite O
all O
these O
positive O
factors O
, O
however O
, O
we O
fear O
that O
the O
situation O
is O
very O
serious O

We O
have O
discovered O
serious O
errors O
in O
the O
implementation O
of O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC

We O
think O
that O
the O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC
, O
as O
they O
are O
currently O
planned O
and O
implemented O
, O
are O
wrong O
, O
that O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
all O
those O
who O
must O
be O
forced O
to O
be O
resettled O
by O
the O
project O
under O
the O
given O
circumstances O
is O
not O
possible O
and O
that O
the O
environmental O
impacts O
of O
the O
project O
are O
not O
carefully O
considered O
or O
adequately O
taken O
into O
account O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
World B-ORG

is O
just O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
situation O
that O
has O
resulted O
, O
as O

The O
Sardar O

a O

as O
two O

a O
large O

on O
the O
Narmada B-LOC

an O
extensive O
canal O

on O
the O
Narmada B-LOC

near O
Navagam B-LOC

will O

The O
Sardar O

Sarovar B-LOC
Dam I-LOC
is O
designed O
along O

that O

The O

the O

stretch O

450 O

at O

the O

The O

a O

75 O

In O

about O
80,000 O

the O

Within O
these O

the O

The O
idea O
of O

the O
Narmada B-LOC
dates O
back O
many O
years O
, O
but O
a O
realization O
was O
made O
more O
difficult O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O

not O

a O

In O
1979 O

the O
Narmada B-MISC

Land O
Court O
in O
India B-LOC
itself O
ruled O
that O

should O
receive O

a O
minimum O
of O
2 O
hectares O
( O
5 O

) O
of O

In O

, O
the O

found O
that O
adult O

should O
be O
treated O
by O

India B-LOC
and O
the O
three O
states O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC

maintain O
the O
position O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
judgement O
of O

, O
land O

should O
apply O

i.e. O
those O

what O
in O

In O
their O
opinion O

it O
was O

the O

that O
indigenous O

in O
the O

for O
which O
they O

In O
1980 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG

principles O
for O
the O
first O

In O

it O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
not O

about O

also O
about O

Therefore O
, O
it O
demands O
that O

at O

regain O
their O

This O

In O

, O
the O
World B-ORG

that O

It O

that O
it O

1985 O

The O

the O
question O

This O
allowed O

At O
the O

, O
the O

did O
not O

although O
in O

admitted O
that O
in O
the O
event O

In O
1990 O
, O
the O

announced O

These O
World B-ORG

principles O
reflect O
the O
general O
adoption O

They O
recognize O
that O
large O

scale O
projects O

in O

, O
can O
expel O

just O
as O

as O
war O
or O
natural O
disasters O

They O
focus O
on O
people O

development O
progress O
and O
demand O
that O
in O
every O
project O
the O
human O
rights O
of O
displaced O
persons O
must O
be O
respected O
. O

According O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
, O
these O
are O
rights O
which O
can O
not O
be O
invalidated O
by O
national O
sovereignty O
or O
national O
interests O
. O

Such O
considerations O
may O
justify O
a O
project O
, O
but O
according O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
they O
do O
not O
justify O
the O
annulment O
of O
these O
human O
rights O
by O

The O
governments O

there O

interpretation O

Gujarat B-LOC
, O
with O
4,700 O

, O
adopted O
a O
policy O
in O
1988 O

after O
which O
every O
landlord O
displaced O

2 O

It O
also O
offers O

2 O
hectares O
; O
tribal O

who O
may O

The O
Government O

the O

of O
Madhya B-LOC

agree O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC

policy O
goes O
beyond O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O

and O
the O
World B-MISC

Maharashtra B-LOC

Madhya B-LOC

But O
they O
are O
not O
willing O

Neither O

recognises O

These O
differences O
in O
the O

How O
can O
this O
be O

in O
the O
case O
of O
displaced O

who O
only O
know O
agriculture O
as O
an O

in O
which O
it O
represents O
the O

cultural O

, O
if O
not O
by O
providing O
them O
with O

In O
1984 O
, O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
Control O
Authority O
, O
which O
had O
been O
set O
up O
to O
monitor O
the O

declared O
: O

" O
For O
indigenous O
people O
there O
is O
no O
more O
effective O
rehabilitation O
than O
to O
provide O
land O
for O

" O

We O
have O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
the O
only O
way O
to O
ensure O
that O
their O
standard O
of O
living O
improves O
or O
remains O
the O
same O
. O

The O
result O
, O
if O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
are O
referred O
to O
as O
landless O
, O
means O
that O
people O
who O
work O
the O
land O
they O
consider O
their O
own O
become O
landless O
workers O
. O

This O
is O
not O
rehabilitation O
. O

It O
does O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
live O
at O
least O
as O
well O
as O
before O
. O

The O
tribal O
people O
in O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
are O
very O
aware O
of O
this O
thing O
and O
what O
it O
means O
to O
them O
if O
they O
are O
relocated O
as O
landless O
farmers O
. O

When O
we O
visited O
Bamni B-LOC
, O
a O
tribal O
village O
in O
Maharashtra B-LOC
, O
people O
told O
us O
: O

" O
We O
are O
farmers O
, O
not O
workers O
. O
" O

In O
our O
view O
, O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
have O
not O
met O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
‚Äôs O
credit O
conditions O
, O
as O
they O
have O
failed O
to O
provide O
adequate O
land O
for O
rehabilitation O
of O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
. O

The O
federal O
states O
argue O
that O
according O
to O
the O
arbitration O
and O
the O
agreements O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
all O
displaced O
persons O
have O
the O
right O
to O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
where O
both O
land O
- O
owners O
and O
landless O
displaced O
persons O
are O
to O
receive O
two O
hectares O
of O
irrigated O
land O
. O

Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
therefore O
expect O
many O
displaced O
people O
to O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
. O

Accordingly O
, O
the O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
resettlement O
plan O
actually O
contains O
only O
10 O
% O
of O
the O
area O
needed O
for O
resettlement O
. O

But O
many O
displaced O
people O
do O
not O
want O
to O
move O
to O
Gujarat B-LOC
for O
reasons O
that O
have O
to O
do O
with O
language O
, O
culture O
and O
other O
ties O
to O
the O
region O
. O

For O
many O
of O
them O
this O
would O
be O
a O
great O
cultural O
change O
. O

Both O
according O
to O
the O
ruling O
of O
the O
arbitration O
court O
and O
according O
to O
the O
agreements O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
displaced O
persons O
have O
the O
right O
to O
be O
resettled O
in O
their O
own O
state O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
been O
quite O
successful O
in O
carrying O
out O
resettlements O
in O
the O
last O
eighteen O
months O
, O
but O
so O
far O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
settled O
only O
about O
3000 O
families O
. O

Resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
so O
many O
more O
displaced O
persons O
- O
perhaps O
15,000 O
families O
- O
from O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC

would O
be O
an O
enormous O
task O
for O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
would O
seriously O
burden O
its O
limited O
resources O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
not O
only O
about O
resettlement O
, O
it O
is O
also O
about O
rehabilitating O
people O

The O
states O
may O
be O
able O
to O
organize O
the O
physical O
relocation O
of O
thousands O
of O

on O

in O
Gujarat B-LOC

but O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
will O
be O
able O
to O

them O
all O
. O

The O
only O

policy O
that O
all O

must O

that O
of O
the O

this O

Their O
right O
to O

should O
have O
been O
recognised O
seven O
years O
ago O
, O
but O
the O
World B-ORG

failed O
to O
ensure O
recognition O
of O
these O

by O

Indeed O
, O
the O
World B-ORG

has O
only O
recently O
urged O
India B-LOC
, O
without O
insisting O
, O
that O
India B-LOC

the O

states O
comply O
with O
the O
1979 O

the O
World B-MISC

The O
World B-ORG

, O
however O
, O
has O
not O
only O
failed O
to O
enforce O
the O

and O
the O

. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
canal O
, O
it O
has O
failed O
in O
so O
far O
as O
it O
has O
not O
laid O
down O
any O
binding O
provision O
in O
its O
contract O
with O
Gujarat B-LOC

which O
requires O
the O
implementation O
of O

What O
about O
the O
villagers O
who O
live O
in O
the O
area O
of O
the O
canal O
? O

The O
construction O
of O
the O
canal O
and O
the O

system O
will O
affect O
140 O
000 O
families O
, O
of O
which O
perhaps O
13 O
000 O
- O
no O
one O
knows O
how O
many O
- O
will O
lose O
a O
large O
part O

their O
entire O
land O
. O

The O
people O
who O
lose O
land O
to O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
are O
offered O
compensation O
under O
the O
Land O
Acquisition O
Act O
of O
1894 O
. O

The O
number O
of O
people O
affected O
is O
disputed O
in O
the O
estimates O
. O

But O
so O
much O
is O
clear O
: O

Acquiring O
land O
under O
the O
land O
- O
acquisition O
law O
has O
often O
meant O
that O
farmers O
who O
lost O
land O
have O
been O
compensated O
with O
amounts O
well O
below O
the O
real O
cost O
of O

The O

clearly O
responsible O
to O

on O
this O

not O

The O
history O
of O
the O
environmental O

of O
Sardar B-LOC

Sarovar I-LOC
is O
a O
history O
of O
unauthorized O
permits O

There O
is O
no O
comprehensive O
document O
on O
the O
impacts O
. O

The O
type O
and O
extent O
of O
environmental O
problems O
and O

are O
unknown O

This O
contributes O
significantly O
to O
the O
controversy O
surrounding O
the O
project O
. O

As O
with O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
, O
this O
fact O
has O
put O
our O
investigation O
in O
a O
difficult O
situation O
. O

To O
finish O
our O
work O
, O
we O
had O
to O
collect O
basic O
ecological O
information O
in O
order O
to O
describe O
the O
likely O
effects O
of O
the O
project O
upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
project O

This O
work O
should O
have O
been O
done O
by O
others O
before O
the O
projects O
were O
approved O
. O

( O
... O

. O

) O

We O
found O
inconsistencies O
in O
the O
basic O
hydrological O
information O
related O
to O
these O
works O
( O
i.e. O
on O
dam O
and O
canal O
, O
i.e. O
) O
. O
Therefore O
, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
water O
flow O
data O
and O
made O
our O
own O
analysis O
. O

We O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
there O
is O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
projects O
will O
not O
work O
as O
planned O
. O

The O
problems O
relate O
to O
the O
frequency O
and O
time O
flow O
of O
stationary O
currents O
as O
well O
as O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O
dam O
and O
canal O
to O
store O
and O
distribute O
water O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
Sardar B-LOC
Sarovar I-LOC
, O
upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
catchment O
area O
will O
therefore O
be O
different O
than O
as O
currently O
assumed O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
the O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
built O
upstream O
as O
planned O
or O
not O
. O

A O
realistic O
operational O
analysis O
on O
which O
an O
environmental O
sustainability O
assessment O
could O
be O
based O
is O
lacking O
. O

This O
has O
alarmed O
us O
and O
it O
should O
also O
alarm O
others O
, O
especially O
with O
a O
mega O

project O
with O
such O
far O

reaching O
implications O
as O

The O
deficiencies O
we O
identified O
in O
the O
limiting O
of O
environmental O
damage O
also O
extend O
to O
the O
project O
‚Äôs O
catchment O
area O
. O

Although O
comprehensive O
studies O
are O
lacking O
, O
we O
found O
that O
there O
will O
likely O
be O
problems O
with O
ingestion O
and O
salting O
. O

Precalculations O
underlying O
the O
plans O
for O
the O
canal O
and O

system O
as O
well O
as O
protection O
measures O
are O
questionable O
. O

We O
can O
only O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
future O
problems O
in O
the O
catchment O
area O
as O
a O
whole O
will O
be O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
found O
by O
the O
World B-ORG

in O
many O

there O
is O
an O
inevitable O
danger O
that O

experienced O
some O
of O

But O
only O
in O
January O

we O
find O
statements O
by O
the O
World B-MISC
Bank I-MISC

that O
the O

gave O
the O
impression O
that O

were O
" O
planned O

carried O
out O
without O

inclusion O
of O

He O
describes O
various O
parts O

the O

as O
" O

of O

as O
a O

He O
reported O
a O

has O
risen O
steeply O
in O

The O
inability O
to O

is O

It O
is O

That O
is O
why O
we O

itself O
the O
goal O
to O

with O
environmentally O

. O

It O
all O
started O
with O
Heino B-PER
Kirchhof I-PER
recognizing O
his O
ecological O
" O
sins O
" O
: O

During O
the O
construction O
of O
his O
house O
he O
had O
installed O
some O
electric O
floor O
heating O
. O
" O

Electricity O
" O
, O
that O
became O
clear O
to O
him O
only O
later O
, O
" O
is O
much O
too O
expensive O
to O
heat O
with O
. O
" O

Thus O
in O
1982 O
he O
replaced O
the O
floor O
heating O
with O
four O
furnaces O
, O
which O
are O
fed O
with O
dry O
beech O
wood O
. O

Not O
so O
comfortable O
, O
" O
he O
admits O
, O
" O
but O
ecologically O
more O
valuable O
. O
" O

About O
three O
years O
later O
, O
the O
churchyard B-PER
installed O
solar O
collectors O
, O
with O
which O
the O
water O
is O
heated O
to O
shower O
, O
wash O
and O
wash O
. O

Such O
solar O
systems O
for O
conventional O
water O
heating O
are O
relatively O
cheaper O
than O
those O
with O
photovoltaics O
, O
if O
you O
compare O
the O
price O
and O
the O
ecological O
benefits O
: O

" O
With O
10,000 O
marks O
, O
" O
Kirchhof B-PER
estimates O
, O
" O
a O
photovoltaic O
plant O
with O
half O
a O
kilowatt O
can O
be O
financed O
, O
saving O
about O
0.5 O
tons O
of O
carbon O

. O
" O

The O
same O
amount O
could O
also O
be O
paid O
for O
a O

. O

And O
the O
spare O
considerably O
more O

This O
is O
why O

According O

the O

grants O
up O
to O
3000 O

not O
more O

about O

- O
not O
only O
because O
it O
has O
brought O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
is O
not O
entirely O
satisfied O

this O
: O

Although O
the O

were O
cheaper O

German B-MISC
builders O
through O
the O

and O
for O
some O
perhaps O

, O
the O

not O
ensure O
a O
real O
breakthrough O
in O

, O
because O
the O
market O

not O

For O
this O
reason O
Kirchhof B-PER
considers O
the O
directives O
to O
be O
worth O
improving O

Somehow O
, O
because O
the O
American B-MISC

could O

the O
formal O

. O

The O
reason O
: O

Some O
of O
the O
conditions O
that O
the O
Minister O
had O
placed O
on O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
settlement O
have O
not O

. O

The O
highest O
hurdle O
: O

In O
a O
vote O
, O
two O
thirds O
of O
the O
tenants O
must O
agree O
to O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
home O

to O
the O

. O

Whether O
this O
result O
can O
be O
achieved O
is O
completely O
open O
. O

In O
November O
, O
the O
tenants O
are O
to O
decide O
in O
secret O
vote O
on O
the O
future O
fate O
of O
the O

. O

Should O
this O
vote O
be O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
, O
the O
Supervisory O
Board O
of O
the O
Nassau B-ORG
hometown I-ORG
can O
finally O
approve O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
settlement O
at O
the O
next O
meeting O
on O
30 O
November O
. O

This O
ended O
a O
seven O

year O
political O
struggle O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O

from O
the O
1920s O
. O

( O
For O
the O
background O
, O

boxes O
on O

) O

The O
further O
conditions O
of O
the O
Minister O
of O
Housing O
can O
be O
more O
easily O
fulfilled O
by O
the O
cooperative O
: O

It O
must O
accede O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Treaty I-MISC
" O
. O

It O
provides O
that O
all O
apartments O
that O
become O
free O
must O
be O
notified O
to O
the O
Housing B-ORG
Authority I-ORG
and O
can O
be O
occupied O
by O
the O
Authority O
with O
new O
tenants O
. O

This O
condition O
is O
easy O
to O
meet O
, O
said O
the O
board O
member O
of O
the O
cooperative O
, O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
. O

Another O
condition O
of O
the O
Minister O
is O
to O
raise O
the O
rental O
price O
piece O
by O
piece O
up O
to O
a O
square O
meter O
price O
of O
8.50 O
marks O
. O

This O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
cooperative O
can O
work O
profitably O
and O
that O
the O
country O
does O
not O
have O
to O
stand O
by O
in O
a O
plea O
for O
outstanding O
debts O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
cooperation O
also O
lacks O
a O
so O
- O
called O
" O
maintenance O
certificate O
" O
according O
to O
information O
from O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
: O

It O
is O
intended O
to O
clarify O
in O
principle O
whether O
a O
small O
cooperative O
can O
lead O
the O
stock O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
of O
only O
1072 O
apartments O
at O
all O
profitable O
. O

If O
all O
conditions O
are O
met O
, O
the O
home O
settlement O
can O
change O
owner O
for O
the O
purchase O
price O
of O
about O
80 O
million O
marks O
. O

The O
sum O
is O
as O
follows O
: O

48,3 O
million O
marks O
give O
the O
country O
to O
the O
cooperation O
as O
a O
zero O
- O
interest O
contribution O
. O

This O
sum O
received O
in O
1986 O
the O
Nassau B-ORG
home I-ORG
for O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
from O
the O
bankruptcy O
estate O
of O
the O
New O
Home O
. O

So O
the O
money O
is O
simply O
" O
passed O
on O
" O
. O

The O
missing O
sum O
of O
about O
32 O
million O
marks O
is O
currently O
covered O
by O
mortgages O
, O
which O
should O
also O
be O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
new O
partnership O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
hiring O
increase O
serves O
to O
gradually O
offset O
the O
basic O
debt O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
to O
repay O
the O
state O
surcharge O
. O

The O
association O
currently O
has O
about O
350 O
members O
. O

It O
promises O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
above O
all O
a O
" O
share O
management O
" O
, O
as O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
explained O
. O
" O

There O
are O
no O
alienated O
working O
conditions O
, O
the O
tenants O
are O
not O
numbers O
and O
in O
the O
long O
term O
they O
will O
determine O
business O
policy O
, O
" O
Schneider B-PER
continued O
. O

Adequate O
checkpoints O
had O
been O
installed O
, O
she O
assured O
, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
tenants O
would O
again O
be O
exposed O
to O
the O
uncertainties O
as O
they O
had O
arisen O
after O
the O
deportation O
of O
the O
former O
owner O
New O
Home O
. O

However O
, O
not O
all O
tenants O
seem O
convinced O
of O
this O
. O

They O
show O
satisfaction O
with O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
through O
the O
Nassauische B-ORG
Heimst√§tte I-ORG
and O
see O
through O
the O
vote O
and O
discussion O
about O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
unnecessary O
unrest O
brought O
to O
the O
Sachsenh√§user B-MISC
residential O
district O
. O

To O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
many O
tenants O
also O
contributes O
that O
the O
maintenance O
status O
of O
the O
apartments O
is O
not O
good O
. O

Only O
recently O
the O
gas O
lines O
in O
the O
settlement O
had O
to O
be O
taken O
off O
the O
grid O
, O
as O
the O
money O
for O
a O
renovation O
was O
lacking O
. O

However O
, O
the O
members O
of O
the O
cooperative O
are O
optimistic O
: O

" O
We O
will O
work O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
tenants O
in O
the O
requested O
majority O
support O
the O
acquisition O
, O
" O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
explained O
. O

Will O
it O
succeed O
to O
inspire O
nearly O
67 O
percent O
of O
tenants O
for O
the O
first O
establishment O
of O
a O

was O
supposed O
to O
prepare O

the O

character O
. O

Now O
, O
as O
Europe B-LOC
's O
borders O
lose O
more O
and O
more O
importance O
, O
new O
possibilities O
arise O
: O

The O
Elsasser B-MISC
is O
a O
Frenchman B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
a O
European O
with O
his O
own O
, O
regional O
, O
historically O
rooted O
identity O
, O
whose O
cultural O
symbol O
is O
bilingualism O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go O
before O
such O
a O
vision O
can O
be O
achieved O
. O

Actually O
, O
what O
is O
at O
stake O
at O
the O
moment O
is O
to O
reverse O
a O
trend O
irrevocably O
, O
which O
has O
been O
applied O
after O
the O
war O
and O
which O
in O
the O
traditional O
German O
- O
speaking B-MISC
Alsace B-LOC
made O
German B-MISC
largely O
a O
foreign O
language O
. O

Suppressed O
, O
even O
banned O
, O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
and O
the O
High B-MISC
German I-MISC
as O
its O
written O
form O
of O
expression O
were O
not O
. O

But O
the O
framework O
conditions O
ensured O
that O
the O
Alsace B-MISC
and O
the O
Germans B-MISC
were O
increasingly O
repulsed O
. O

Thus O
, O
many O
local O
and O
street O
signs O
were O
franchised B-MISC
. O

The O
official O
postal O
service O
could O
only O
be O
operated O
in O
French B-MISC
soon O
after O
the O
war O
. O

In O
the O
kindergartens O
, O
even O
Elsesian B-MISC
singers O
disappeared O
from O
the O
program O
. O

The O
German B-MISC
lessons I-MISC
at O
the O
schools O
were O
reduced O
. O

In O
the O
German B-MISC
- O
language O
editions O
of O
the O
daily O
newspapers O
the O
popular O
sports O
section O
had O
to O
appear O
in O
French B-MISC
. O

In O
not O
few O
families O
existed O
and O
exist O
two O
language O
worlds O
: O

Parents O
talk O
in O
the O
dialect O
, O
the O
conversations O
with O
the O
children O
take O
place O
in O
French B-MISC
. O

The O
consequence O
: O

French B-MISC
quickly O
developed O
into O
the O
dominant O
spoken O
language O
in O
the O
Alsace O
. O

The O
German B-MISC
- O
language O
editions O
of O
the O
regional O
editions O
lost O
and O
are O
still O
losing O
in O
circulation O
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
younger O
people O
are O
no O
longer O
powerful O
. O

In O
the O
restaurant O
, O
the O
patron O
can O
help O
German B-MISC
guests O
who O
do O
not O
speak O
French B-MISC
, O
often O
even O
linguistically O
, O
which O
is O
usually O
not O
possible O
for O
the O
young O
operator O
or O
saleswoman O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
seventies O
, O
EGEurope B-LOC
did O
not O
remain O
ineffective O
- O
the O
German B-MISC
instruction I-MISC
in O
schools O
was O
extended O
again O
. O

The O
French B-MISC
and O
Baden B-MISC
school O
authorities O
agreed O
a O
program O
to O
promote O
the O
playful O
learning O
of O
the O
" O
language O
of O
the O
neighbour O
" O
at O
primary O
school O
age O
, O
including O
mutual O
classroom O
visits O
, O
and O
the O
resonance O
in O
the O
schools O
was O
enormous O
. O

But O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
a O
real O
" O
bilinguism O
" O
associations O
such O
as O
the O
Ren√© B-ORG
- I-ORG
Schickele I-ORG
- O
Kreis O
, O
which O
is O
strong O
for O
bilingualism O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
- I-LOC
Lothringen I-LOC
, O
had O
to O
feel O
for O
a O
long O
time O
still O
as O
lonely O
callers O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

But O
with O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Wall O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
the O
Iron B-MISC
Curtain I-MISC
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
it O
has O
become O
almost O
fashionable O
in O
the O
social O
life O
of O
Alsace B-LOC
to O
advocate O
" O
le O
bilinguisme O
" O
. O

The O
most O
visible O
expression O
of O
this O
development O
: O

In O
more O
and O
more O
places O
, O
the O
French B-MISC
street O
names O
are O
accompanied O
by O
Alsace B-MISC
subtitles O
. O

So O
now O
in O
M√ºlhausen B-LOC
the O
" O
Rue B-LOC
des I-LOC
Marechaux I-LOC
" O
is O
also O
called O
" O
Schmidgass B-LOC
" O
, O
in O
Colmar B-LOC
the O
" O
Rue B-LOC
des I-LOC
Pr√™tres I-LOC
" O
is O
occupied O
with O
the O
title O
" O
Pfaffegassle B-LOC
" O
which O
sounds O
somewhat O
disrespectful O
to O
German O
ears O
. O

The O
core O
issue O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
language O
teaching O
in O
schools O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
transmission O
of O
German B-MISC
to O
the O
schools O
in O
Alsace B-MISC
is O
further O
intensified O
. O

As O
part O
of O
a O
model O
project O
, O
German B-MISC
was O
spoken O
to O
around O
60 O
classes O
in O
30 O
elementary O
schools O
three O
hours O
a O
week O
outside O
the O
usual O
German I-MISC
classes I-MISC
in O
various O
subjects O
in O
the O
school O
year O
that O
has O
just O
ended O
. O

A O
spectacular O
success O
has O
been O
achieved O
by O
the O
ABCM B-MISC
Citizens I-MISC
' O
Initiative O
, O
which O
has O
already O
involved O
about O
800 O
parents O
and O
teachers O
: O

Supported O
by O
subsidies O
from O
the O
Alsace B-MISC
Regional O
Council O
, O
the O
two O
General O
Councils O
and O
even O
the O
EC B-ORG
, O
also O
with O
the O
practical O
help O
of O
some O
municipalities O
, O
six O
now O
really O
bilingual O
pre O
- O
school O
classes O
could O
be O
set O
up O
, O
in O
which O
13 O
hours O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
13 O
hours O
of O
German B-MISC
are O
spoken O
. O

This O
first O
significant O
advance O
towards O
" O
bilinguism O
" O
demonstrates O
that O
the O
supporters O
of O
bilingualism O
are O
still O
facing O
a O
persistent O
opponent O
- O
and O
that O
is O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
. O

In O
Alsace B-LOC
he O
is O
present O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
national O
school O
authority O
. O

Since O
1982 O
, O
in O
principle O
, O
a O
law O
allows O
equal O
instruction O
in O
French B-MISC
and O
the O
respective O
regional O
language O
, O
if O
parents O
so O
wish O
. O

This O
directive O
was O
implemented O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
in O
Brittany B-LOC
, O
but O
not O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

The O
real O
concern O
of O
ABCM B-ORG
is O
the O
establishment O
of O
bilingual O
classes O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
official O
state O
school O
system O
. O

The O
municipal O
council O
of O
M√ºlhausen B-LOC
also O
made O
a O
corresponding O
decision O
. O

However O
, O
ABCM B-ORG
was O
left O
with O
nothing O
but O
to O
make O
a O
first O
move O
with O
bilingual O
kindergartens O
on O
a O
private O
basis O
. O

But O
even O
these O
initiatives O
encounter O
resistance O
in O
some O
places O
, O
the O
promised O
subsidies O
of O
the O
EC B-ORG
and O
the O
Alsace B-MISC
regional O
bodies O
can O
not O
be O
fully O
exploited O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
opportunity O
: O

Sometimes O
the O
municipalities O
did O
not O
provide O
space O
, O
with O
ABCM B-ORG
suggesting O
that O
the O
state O
school O
authority O
occasionally O
also O
exerts O
pressure O
on O
mayors O
. O

In O
the O
most O
spectacular O
dispute O
in O
Pulversheim B-LOC
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
state O
school O
defend O
themselves O
, O
with O
backing O
of O
a O
teacher O
's O
association O
, O
against O
that O
in O
the O
same O
building O
in O
a O

otherwise O
unused O

) O
Room O
was O
accommodated O
a O
bilingual O

. O

The O
Mairie O
and O
the O

had O
already O
confronted O
themselves O
in O
court O
. O

The O
matter O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
settled O
definitively O
. O

After O
all O
: O

" O

now O
use O
the O

wrong O
in O
their O
assumption O
that O
behind O
disinterest O
and O
persistent O
resistance O
in O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
lies O
the O
fear O
of O
a O
sluggish O
" O
Germanization B-MISC
" O
of O
Alsace B-LOC
, O
of O
a O
" O
decoupling O
" O
of O
this O
region O
, O
also O
the O
will O
, O
the O
dominance O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
thus O
also O
the O
political O
priority O
of O
centralism O
in O
no O
way O
to O
give O
up O
. O

But O
even O
the O
most O
determined O
supporters O
of O
" O
bilinguism O
" O
clearly O
define O
themselves O
as O
French B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
as O
Europeans B-MISC
and O
Alsatians B-MISC
, O
who O
want O
to O
preserve O
and O
rebuild O
a O
social O
and O
cultural O
regional O
identity O
through O
bilingualism O
in O
a O
growing O
Europe B-LOC
. O

So O
not O
only O
in O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
overcome O
resistance O
. O

There O
are O
also O
contradictions O
in O
Elsass B-LOC
itself O
. O

Thus O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
city B-ORG

of O
Strasbourg O
, O
60 O
streets O
and O

with O
their O

especially O
in O
the O
European B-MISC
city I-MISC
on O
unexpectedly O
fierce O
protest O
, O
which O
settled O
in O
numerous O
reader O
letters O
buried O
Strasbourg B-MISC
citizens O
and O
thoughtful O
comments O
in O
the O
media O
. O

German B-MISC
, O
according O
to O
the O
critics O
, O
was O
not O
only O
the O
language O
of O
the O
Strasbourg B-MISC
student O
Goethe B-PER
, O
but O
also O
the O
language O
of O
Hitler B-PER
. O

There O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
the O
Nazi B-MISC
period I-MISC
in O
Alsace B-LOC
continued O
quite O
as O
a O
trauma O
. O

For O
months O
this O
dispute O
persisted O
until O
finally O
a O
compromise O
was O
found O
: O

The O
signs O
on O
the O
streets O
and O
squares O
do O
not O
have O
German B-MISC
names O
, O
but O
Elsesian O
additional O
names O
- O
as O
already O
in O
many O
places O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Alsace B-MISC
supporters O
of O
bilingualism O
can O
see O
themselves O
in O
the O
unstoppable O
trend O
of O
the O
time O
. O

Only O
the O
practical O
experience O
and O
requirements O
of O
the O
EC B-MISC
internal I-MISC
market I-MISC
promote O
the O
tendency O
to O
" O

" O
. O

After O
all O

The O

to O
set O

in O
Bad B-LOC
Homburg I-LOC

On O
June O
14th O

the O
young O
people O
came O
together O
to O
take O
suggestions O
from O
young O

in O
their O

and O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
" O
great O
" O

The O
initial O
scepticism O
among O

up O
" O

is O
clear O

But O
how O

last O

, O
which O
brought O
a O

so O
far O

the O

went O

the O
work O
of O

a O

to O
give O
the O
young O

an O
influence O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
council O
of O

of O
the O

has O
now O
decided O
to O
grant O
young O
people O
the O
right O
to O
speak O
in O
committees O
- O
but O
only O
on O
the O
proposals O
they O
put O
forward O
. O

" O
We O
did O

find O
a O
right O
of O

She O
has O
accompanied O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

In O
your O
opinion O
, O
it O
was O
right O
to O
limit O
the O
influence O
of O
young O
people O
, O
but O
in O
the O
points O
they O
put O
forward O
, O
" O
to O
take O
on O
the O
duty O
so O
that O
they O
learn O
to O
listen O
and O
ask O
questions O
" O
. O

This O
educational O
approach O
disturbs O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
Green B-MISC

in O
the O
city O

, O
Renate B-PER
Bill I-PER
. O

She O
fears O

a O

potential O
" O
of O
young O

which O
should O
also O
be O

Peter B-PER
Walz I-PER

also O
fears O
that O

" O
. O

For O
him O
there O
is O
no O
youth O

, O
" O
if O
it O
can O
not O

anything O
" O
. O

The O
young O
people O
do O
not O
have O
so O
little O
hope O
: O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
is O
important O
for O
them O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
parliamentary O
life O
. O
‚Äù O

Only O
then O
will O
we O
take O

who O
also O
sits O
in O

Results O
are O
especially O
important O
to O
him O
: O

" O
We O
have O
to O
be O
able O
to O
prove O
something O
. O

Then O
the O
young O
people O
also O
take O
this O
seriously O
and O
continue O
to O
support O
us O
. O
" O

For O
one O
thing O
the O
young O
parliamentarians O
have O
recognised O
: O

Without O
support O
among O
the O
peers O
, O
the O
youth O
parliament O
will O
not O
go O
any O
further O
. O
" O

We O
are O
really O
just O
the O
representatives O
. O

We O
can O
only O
pass O
on O
what O
young O
people O
bring O
to O
us O
. O
" O

This O
viewpoint O
they O
also O
represent O
so O
vehemently O
, O
because O
they O
do O
not O
want O
that O
" O
so O
a O
mentality O
arises O
: O

" O
We O
have O
our O
officials O
now O
and O
they O
are O
already O
doing O
that O
. O
" O

Only O
a O
few O
suggestions O
have O
so O
far O
reached O
the O
youth O
parliament O
. O

Perhaps O
because O
the O
young O
people O
first O
had O
to O
enter O
the O
depths O
of O
local O
politics O
themselves O
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
this O
is O
concerned O

impressed O
by O
the O

" O

Very O
quickly O
they O

have O

then O
it O

hope O
that O
also O
shares O
the O
SPD B-MISC
group I-MISC
chair I-MISC
Beate B-PER
Fleige I-PER
. O

She O
considers O
it O
crucial O
that O
" O
now O
even O
the O
young O
people O
themselves O
articulate O
what O
they O
need O
. O
" O

That O
much O
has O
n't O
come O
yet O
, O
" O
said O
Franz B-PER
Kaunzner I-PER
, O
chairman O
of O
the O
CDU O
group O
. O

He O
regards O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
primarily O
as O
an O
exercise O
room O
: O

" O
If O
one O
sometimes O
wonders O
how O
great O
the O
ignorance O
is O
, O
" O
the O
participation O
in O
the O
youth O
parliament O
could O
certainly O
contribute O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
opinion O
among O
young O
people O
. O

What O
he O
urges O
, O
however O
, O
is O
continuity O
: O

" O
If O
they O
send O
another O
representative O
every O
time O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
. O
" O

This O
has O
also O
been O
recognised O
by O
young O
people O
: O

They O
do O
not O
want O
to O
worship O
the O
principle O
of O
rotation O
. O

But O
also O
they O
will O
grow O
up O
once O
the O
youth O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
their O
term O
of O
office O
is O
sometimes O
one O
year O
. O

What O
comes O
after O
that O
, O
even O
the O
young O
people O
do O
not O
know O
. O

They O
strongly O
oppose O
considering O
their O
establishment O
as O
a O
young O
tenant O
: O

" O
Nothing O
has O
been O
forged O
here O
yet O
, O
" O
white O
cows B-PER
say O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
join O
the O
party O
, O
go O
directly O
to O
their O
youth O
organisation O
- O
without O
going O
through O
the O
youth O
parliament O
. O

He O
himself O
is O
far O
from O
thinking O
of O
a O
political O
career O
: O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
professional O
politician O
. O

That O
's O
somebody O
who O

On O
the O
way O
home O
from O
a O
business O
celebration O
, O
the O
driver O
saw O
some O
acquaintances O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
a O
kiosk O
in O
Bad B-LOC
Vilbel I-LOC
on O
September O
7th O
last O
year O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
stopped O
. O

After O
he O
had O
drunk O
some O
bottles O
of O
beer O
, O
he O
joined O
the O
group O
, O
which O
started O
at O
4 O
o'clock O
with O
several O
cars O
on O
the O
fateful O
journey O
to O
the O
north O
of O
Frankfurt B-MISC
. O

The O
column O
was O
merged O
into O
two O
vehicles O
when O
a O
pedestrian O
suddenly O
appeared O
on O
the O
Harheim B-LOC
intersection O
road O
. O

The O
20 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
had O
just O
returned O
from O
his O
brother O
's O
dinner O
party O
and O
had O
a O
little O
torque O
( O
1.3 O
percent O
alcohol O
in O
the O
blood O
) O
. O

While O
the O
first O
car O
could O
still O
evade O
, O
the O
defendant O
had O
driven O
so O
closely O
that O
he O
recognized O
the O
danger O
too O
late O
. O

His O
car O
caught O
the O
pedestrian O
and O
slid O
him O
over O
60 O
meters O
far O
with O
. O

The O
man O
was O
immediately O
dead O
. O

As O
a O
test O
in O
the O
Institute O
of O
Forensic O
Medicine O
revealed O
, O
the O
driver O
had O
1.08 O
percent O
alcohol O
in O
the O
blood O
. O

According O
to O
the O
medical O
expert O
, O
he O
was O
no O
longer O
intoxicated O
due O
to O
the O
collapsed O
beers O
as O
well O
as O
due O
to O
fatigue O
and O
overwork O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
past O
, O
the O
33 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
had O
problems O
with O
alcohol O
at O
the O
tax O
. O

In O
1983 O
he O
was O
sentenced O
to O
a O
probationary O
term O
after O
drinking O
to O
cause O
an O
accident O
involving O
personal O
injury O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
months O
after O
the O
fatal O
accident O
, O
the O
defendant O
was O
arrested O
again O
in O
February O
1992 O
on O
a O
troughing O
trip O
. O

On O
the O
way O
with O
2.6 O
percent O
on O
a O
moped O
, O
he O
crashed O
in O
a O
construction O
site O
, O
where O
he O
was O
seriously O
injured O
. O

He O
no O
longer O
had O
his O
driver O
's O
license O
; O
the O
police O
had O
brought O
him O
in O
after O
the O
Harheim B-MISC
accident O
. O

For O
the O
court O
, O
this O
was O
further O
proof O
that O
the O
defendant O
was O
no O
longer O
suitable O
for O
driving O
a O
motor O
vehicle O
. O

He O
was O
sentenced O
to O
three O
years O
in O
prison O
. O

According O
to O
the O
judgment O
, O
the O
sentence O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
subjected O
to O
review O
because O
of O
the O
previous O
traffic O
offences O
. O

Since O
the O
driver O
no O
longer O
wants O
to O
know O
anything O
about O
alcohol O
, O
the O
judiciary O
admitted O
. O

But O
this O
could O
not O
have O
been O
as O
punitive O
as O
a O
suicide O
attempt O
and O
the O
difficult O
professional O
situation O
of O
the O
former O
driver O
, O
who O
now O

that O
he O

This O
happened O
on O
25 O

, O
the O

remained O
14 O

At O
the O

on O
25 O

, O
a O
decision O
was O

the O

extensive O

Only O
on O
4 O

was O
discussed O
about O
the O

Result O
: O

They O
are O
not O
complete O

the O

must O
submit O
new O

J√ºrgen B-PER

has O
now O
spent O
four O

six O
weeks O
drawing O
the O

Provided O
that O
the O
urban O
working O
group O
then O
agrees O
, O
another O
three O
to O
four O
months O
must O
be O
counted O
. O

According O
to O
the O
experience O
of O
Klaus B-PER
Janz I-PER
, O
police O
and O
road O
authorities O
need O
on O
average O
six O
to O
eight O
weeks O
each O
to O
implement O
the O
plans O
: O

" O
But O
this O
only O
applies O
if O
there O
is O
no O
big O
workload O
like O
at O
trade O
fairs O
. O
" O

For O
Klaus B-PER
Janz I-PER
too O
, O
the O
southern O
West B-LOC
is O
an O
extraordinary O
case O
. O

Already O
after O
the O
second O
session O
, O
the O
zones O
are O
usually O
decided O
upon O
in O
principle O
. O

It O
is O
also O
clear O
for O
him O
: O

" O
If O
the O
Westend B-LOC
were O
our O
only O
thing O
we O
have O
on O
the O
desk O
, O
then O
this O
could O
also O
go O
faster O
. O
" O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
will O
not O
hesitate O
to O
emphasize O
that O
there O
should O
be O
a O
" O
principal O
consensus O
" O
with O
the O
planning O
of O
the O
local O
council O
. O

For O
on O
- O
site O
rumours O
had O
already O
appeared O
, O
the O
city O
administration O
wants O
to O
shake O
again O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
the O
new O
traffic O
management O
. O

When O
the O
Tempo-30 O
shields O
are O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
End O
, O
no O
official O
wants O
to O
speculate O
about O
it O
. O

As O
one O
of O
the O
planners O
said O
: O

" O
If O
I O
were O
a O
clairvoyant O
, O
then O
I O
would O
earn O
my O
money O
somewhere O
else O
. O

also O
considering O
how O
to O

Already O
in O

reduce O

on O

Now O
the O
district O

have O
launched O
a O

: O

the O

demanded O
at O
the O

" O

" O
G√ºnter B-PER

justified O
the O

" O
that O

" O

But O
even O

Weatherling B-PER
: O

" O
Since O
we O
ca O

simply O
arrange O

" O

This O
would O
only O
be O
possible O
if O
" O
the O

But O
here O

as O

have O
already O
emphasized O
, O
the O
cat O
in O

: O

It O

Anton B-PER
Winter I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG

had O
already O
suspected O
during O
the O
council O
meeting O
that O
the O
city O
would O
in O
no O
way O
prescribe O
speed O
30 O
on O
the O
alley B-LOC
ring I-LOC
- O
and O
thus O
also O
justified O
the O
rejection O
of O
his O
group O
. O

With O
a O
speed O
reduction O
it O
was O
not O
done O
, O
Winter B-PER
said O
beyond O
that O
. O

Rather O
, O
the O
islands O
should O
be O
enlarged O
. O

Only O
then O
would O
pedestrians O
be O
safer O
. O

A O
view O
that O
also O
G√ºnther B-PER
Boege I-PER
supported O
. O

But O
the O
SPD B-MISC
group I-MISC
could O
not O
get O
along O
with O
the O
idea O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

A O
reconstruction O
of O
the O
entire O
crossing O
will O
only O
make O
sense O
, O
argued O
its O
chairman O
Bernd B-PER
Scherf I-PER
, O
once O
the O
underground O
construction O
is O
completed O
. O

Previously O
such O
a O
project O
would O
be O
much O
too O
expensive O
. O

Transport O
planner O
Klaus B-PER
Wetterling I-PER
shares O
this O
view O
. O

It O
was O
only O
six O
years O
ago O
that O
the O
square O
was O
redesigned O
for O
underground O
construction O
. O
" O

Even O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
every O
track O
, O
why O
should O
we O
now O
pay O
for O
a O

she O
must O
first O
bend O
her O

On O

Only O
now O
she O
recognizes O
what O
is O
lacking O
at O
the O

of O
the O

So O
she O
fought O
hard O

what O
she O
wanted O
: O

Senior O
Advisory O
. O

Now O
she O
fights O
to O
keep O
the O

alive O

Immediately O
after O
her O
retirement O
she O
took O
care O
of O
pensioners O
, O
took O
seniors O

learned O
about O
the O

of O

The O
Portrait O

Repeatedly O
she O
tells O
me O
that O
a O

When O

she O
fights O
with O
her O
feelings O
: O

" O
It O

No O

did O
not O

Now O
, O
after O
her O

, O
she O
can O
remember O
many O
conversations O
with O

the O

Mostly O
she O
hit O
on O
granite O
when O
she O
wanted O
to O
achieve O
something O
for O
the O
seniors O
: O

" O
For O
example O
, O
setting O
up O
an O
elderly O
couple O
was O
not O
possible O
even O
after O
several O

The O
reasoning O
was O
: O

, O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
laugh O
and O
moan O
as O
much O
as O
the O
foreign O

? O
' O

. O

After O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
more O

" O

For O
this O
reason O
Hilde B-PER
Baier I-PER
holds O
on O
to O
her O
seniors O
advice O
: O

" O
Elderly O
fellow O
people O
should O
also O
get O
what O
they O

The O
fear O
of O
the O

in O
the O

of O

should O

Hilde B-PER

legitimizes O
her O
commitment O
to O

with O
a O
phrase O
that O
one O

from O

" O
The O

she O

a O

a O
bit O

In O

not O
feared O

now O
she O
is O
already O

the O
path O
of O
the O

resistance O

Perhaps O
their O

are O

Exactly O
these O
are O
the O
moments O
in O
which O
their O

wake O
up O

Then O
she O
sets O

" O

When O
I O
sit O
there O

my O

get O

I O
ask O
myself O

you O
can O
do O
that O
too O

But O
she O
likes O
not O

at O
Michael B-LOC

Grzimek I-LOC
- O
Schule O
was O
extremely O
desirable O
for O
elementary O
students O
, O
but O
hardly O
to O
realize O
. O

The O
existing O
gymnasium O
, O
which O
appeared O
to O
be O
too O
small O
years O
ago O
, O
had O
to O
be O
torn O
down O
. O

This O
would O
have O
resulted O
in O
the O
disruption O
of O
schooling O
for O
at O
least O
two O
years O
by O
Baul√§rm O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
no O
sports O
hours O
could O
be O
held O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC
school O
and O
sports O
director O
Sylvia B-PER
Schenk I-PER
is O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
due O
to O
the O
general O
lack O
of O
gymnasiums O
in O
the O
city O
no O
indoor O
hall O
, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
so O
small O
, O
should O
be O
demolished O
. O

Especially O
in O
Nieder B-LOC
- I-LOC
Eschbach I-LOC
, O
where O
in O
any O
case O
only O
two O
sports O
halls O
and O
a O
gym O
are O
available O
, O
such O
an O
action O
would O
worsen O
the O
tension O
still O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
larger O
hall O
on O
the O
premises O
of O
the O
Michael B-LOC
- I-LOC
Grzimek I-LOC

would O
reduce O

Also O

the O

of O
the O

The O
students O
of O
the O
MGS B-LOC
, O
who O
do O
not O
all O
find O
place O
in O
the O
school O
gymnasium O
, O
would O
need O
to O
walk O
a O
quarter O
hour O
to O
get O
there O
. O

With O
a O
sport O
lesson O
of O
only O
45 O
minutes O
this O
would O
not O
be O
portable O
. O

The O
only O
possibility O
remains O
to O
build O
the O
new O
hall O
on O
the O
sports O
ground O
of O
Otto B-LOC

Since O

some O

, O
the O
OHS B-LOC

which O

would O
not O
create O
any O
additional O

, O
which O

about O
200 O

this O

Also O
here O

Weiser B-PER
also O

out O

‚Äôs O

, O
it O

The O
result O

" O

Claus O

Peter B-PER

discovered O
" O

as O
a O

Mark B-PER

can O
well O
imagine O
that O
the O
term O
" O
German B-MISC

will O
eventually O
disappear O
from O
the O
statutes O
of O

Since O
the O
singing O
clubs O
also O
and O
above O
all O
want O
to O
reach O
the O
younger O
generation O
, O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
to O

" O
anecdotes B-PER
of I-PER
Tharau I-PER
, O
but O
with O
pieces O
from O
musicals O
and O
modern O
music O
also O
to O
inspire O
the O
youth O
for O
choir O
singing O
. O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
singers O
see O
themselves O
as O
victims O
of O
the O
dilemma O
that O
a O
composer O
composes O
only O
if O
he O
also O
knows O
that O
this O
work O
is O
bought O
for O
him O
. O

And O
this O
, O
according O
to O
Claus O
- O
Peter B-PER
Blaschke I-PER
, O
is O
still O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
in O
modern O
music O
. O

The O
trend O
of O
many O
horns O
still O
goes O
to O
sing O
( O
and O
buy O
) O
what O
you O
know O
. O

Consequently O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
the O
clubs O
have O
little O
literature O
that O
is O
appealing O
to O
young O
people O
, O
Blaschke B-PER
explains O
and O
gets O
into O
a O
frenzy O
over O
the O
choral O
edits O
of O
the O
Beatles B-MISC
song I-MISC
" O
Let O
it O
be O
" O
. O

New O
compositions O
allowed O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
also O
a O
stronger O
confrontation O
with O
today O
's O
times O
. O
" O

When O
I O
see O
our O
nature O
misery O
, O
then O
I O
can O
sing O
, O
Oh O
, O
You O
beautiful O
forest O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
thing O
has O
a O
meaning O
. O

But O
it O
could O
also O
be O
a O
contemporary O
composer O
to O
write O
a O
work O
about O
the O
extinction O
of O
the O
forest O
. O

But O
he O
only O
does O
it O
if O
he O
can O
also O
sell O
it O
. O
" O

Only O
if O
a O
solution O
is O
found O
, O
the O
clubs O
open O
themselves O
to O
the O
youth O
and O
care O
for O
them O
, O
the O
choir O
singing O
can O
have O
a O
future O
in O
his O
opinion O
. O

Some O
churches O
in O

he O
also O
prophesies O
their O
extinction O

Other O

as O

or O
the O
" O

" O
let O
him O
look O
forward O
with O
hope O
. O

Especially O
the O
singing O
for O
him O
besides O
the O
purely O
musical O
also O
promotes O
the O
" O
communal O
sense O
" O
. O

In O
our O
society O
, O
the O

represents O
in O
his O
eyes O
a O
cell O
of O
personal O
contacts O
: O

the O
group O
dynamic O
aspect O
as O
" O
important O
by O

product O

of O

But O
he O
also O
finds O
that O
" O
singing O
liberates O

most O

Even O
more O

should O
make O
them O

, O
so O
his O
conviction O

The O
openness O
demanded O
by O
him O
must O
also O
mean O
the O
courage O
to O
make O
new O
, O
difficult O
and O
unknown O
pieces O
. O

But O
that O
, O
which O
makes O
the O
spectrum O

clear O
, O
is O
different O
from O

To O

every O
20 O

as O
possible O
at O
a O
denser O
rate O
of O
the O
" O

The O

the O
votes O
of O
the O

As O
their O
chairman O
Dieter B-PER
Kunzler I-PER
said O
, O
the O
44er O
is O
a O
" O
ghost O
bus O
" O
anyway O
, O
which O
is O
hardly O
used O
especially O
in O
the O
evening O
hours O

He O
described O
it O
as O
" O
not O
particularly O
meaningful O
" O
to O
let O
the O

roll O
even O
more O
often O
" O
through O
the O
narrow O
streets O
of O
Fechenheim B-LOC
" O
. O

This O
is O
not O
an O
argument O
against O
a O
shorter O
time O
frame O
, O
said O
Albrecht B-PER
Reinhard I-PER
( O
FDP B-ORG

. O

Just O
because O
the O
bus O
travels O
so O
rarely O
, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
cheap O
means O
of O
transport O
and O
is O
therefore O
used O
only O
little O
. O

This O
will O
change O
if O
the O

, O
speculated O
the O

This O
has O
been O

A O
major O
disadvantage O

remains O
: O

It O
is O
simply O
too O
small O
to O

all O

. O

Therefore O
, O
the O

the O
Linneplatz B-LOC

There O
, O
however O
, O
the O

do O
not O

Because O
, O
as O

For O

that O

Their O

so O

tried O
a O
standard O
control O

for O
the O

about O
two O
years O
ago O
. O

However O
, O
the O
dispute O
over O
the O
construction O
site O
in O
preferred O
slopes O
goes O
further O
back O
. O

A O
first O
plan O
of O
1983 O
had O
been O
withdrawn O
by O
the O
Magistrate O
at O
that O
time O
. O

The O
SPD B-MISC
- I-MISC
led I-MISC
state O
government O
had O
complained O
of O
legal O
and O
formal O
errors O
in O
the O
application O
. O

Basically O
, O
Greens B-ORG
and O
SPD B-ORG
refused O
to O
open O
the O
site O
for O
a O
few O
" O
luxury O
houses O
" O
expensive O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
keep O
the O
" O

as O
part O
of O
a O
green O
axis O
between O
Seckbach B-LOC
, O
the O
nature O

" O
Hungerbach B-LOC
" O
and O
Berger B-LOC
Hang I-LOC
. O

When O
the O
CDU B-ORG
then O
also O
ruled O
in O
Wiesbaden B-LOC
, O
the O
magistrate O
presented O
a O
second O
plan O
, O
which O
was O
hardly O
different O
from O
the O
first O
. O

In O
1988 O
, O
before O
the O
parliamentary O
elections O
and O
the O
subsequent O
change O
of O
government O
, O
the O
Hessian B-MISC
interior O

blessed O
the O
construction O
plan O
380 O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
built O
is O
due O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
to O
the O
complex O
relocation O
procedure O
for O
the O
area O
: O

The O
" O
stone B-LOC
" O
consists O
of O
many O
small O
parcels O
, O
which O
run O
as O
narrow O
strips O
in O
north O
- O
south O
direction O
. O

An O
exception O
here O
is O
the O
mentioned O
approximately O
1060 O
square O
meters O
plot O
in O
the O
west O
of O
the O
area O
, O
on O
which O
already O
stands O
a O
concrete O
foundation O
. O

The O
owners O
therefore O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
relocation O
, O
but O
could O
start O
construction O
already O
now O
. O

From O
the O
very O
beginning O
, O
the O
workers O
there O
swirled O
heavily O
on O
dust O
, O
which O
is O
why O
Klaus B-PER
Boller I-PER
was O
able O
to O
effect O
a O
construction O
stop O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

Already O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
July O
he O
had O
filed O
an O
objection O
to O
the O
building O
permit O
after O
he O
had O
seen O
it O
a O
few O
days O
before O
. O

The O
tax O
man O
, O
who O
had O
been O
fighting O
from O
the O
outset O
against O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
wildcats O
, O
noticed O
several O
so O
- O
called O
exemptions O
from O
the O
original O
plan O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
requirement O
not O
to O
build O
row O
houses O
, O
the O
builders O
on O
the O
property O
concerned O
may O
also O
deviate O
from O
the O
prescribed O
number O
of O
floors O
( O
GRZ O
) O
and O
the O
number O
of O
floors O
( O
GFZ O
) O
. O

These O
values O
give O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
built O
land O
area O
and O
the O
area O
of O
all O
rooms O
of O
a O
house O
to O
the O
number O
of O
square O
meters O
of O
the O
entire O
building O
site O
. O

The O
approved O
ground O
and O
floor O
area O
figures O
were O
raised O
in O
the O
building O
permit O
by O
40 O
and O
44 O
percent O
respectively O
compared O
to O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
B O

. O

This O
means O
, O
simplified O
, O
that O
a O
larger O
part O
of O
the O

will O
be O
built O
than O
originally O
envisaged O

itself O

for O
there O
to O
build O
a O
" O
long O

" O
, O
explained O
by O
guards B-PER
. O

Without O
the O
release O
only O
one O
house O
could O
have O
stood O
there O
, O
but O
due O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
building O
site O
several O
houses O
would O
have O
been O
appropriate O
. O

However O
, O
these O
conditions O
did O
not O
generally O
apply O
to O
the O
" O
stone B-LOC
" O
, O
but O
only O
to O
this O
small O
section O
. O

The O
two O
other O
exemptions O
for O
the O
ground O
and O
the O
number O
of O
shots O
had O
been O
approved O
due O
to O
a O
" O
computer O
error O
, O
" O
the O
official O
also O
said O
. O

It O
was O
erroneously O
assumed O
that O
the O
ratio O
of O

to O

differed O
from O
the O

plan O
. O

However O
, O
both O
figures O
are O
still O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
the O

Consequently O
, O
the O

says O

about O
the O

" O

In O
principle O
Kleinert B-PER
believes O
that O
Western O
party O
democracies O
have O
produced O
an O
increasingly O
differentiated O
, O
highly O
complex O
network O
of O
institutions O
. O

In O
this O
, O
in O
the O
sum O
of O
the O
actions O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
actors O
produces O
a O
growing O
inflexibility O
of O
the O
overall O
system O
. O
" O

Encouragingly O
, O
one O
could O
say O
: O

An O
increasing O
number O
of O
stakeholders O
produces O
more O
and O
more O
noise O
at O
the O
various O
levels O
of O
politics O
, O
administration O
and O
jurisprudence O
. O

Relatively O
little O
is O
achieved O
in O
the O
matter O
by O
the O
increasing O
volume O
. O

Because O
this O
is O
the O
case O
, O
politics O
is O
increasingly O
fleeing O
into O
symbolism O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
contradicts O
the O
legitimacy O
of O
media O
democracy O
. O

Instead O
of O
actions O
, O
the O
demonstration O
of O
thoughtfulness O
, O
the O
assurance O
that O
the O
problem O
will O
be O
taken O
seriously O

etc O

" O

Kleinert B-PER
sees O
in O
the O
development O
he O
has O
sketched O
also O
a O
backside O
of O
the O
democratization O
chub O
, O
which O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
years O
has O
produced O
a O
considerable O
gain O
in O
freedom O
of O
decision O
for O
the O
individual O
. O

Politics O
have O
made O
it O
harder O
to O
legitimize O
itself O
, O
the O
willingness O
to O
accept O
fragically O
decisions O
of O
superior O
authorities O
has O
declined O
. O

Also O
the O
meaning O
of O
" O
formalized O
social O
relations O
" O
, O
i.e. O
parties O
, O
trade O
unions O
or O
even O
associations O
, O
is O
declining O
. O

According O
to O
Kleinert B-PER
, O
the O
weakness O
in O
the O
design O
of O
politics O
is O
also O
the O
price O
that O
Western O
societies O
would O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
their O
high O
degree O
of O
pluralism O
of O
interests O
, O
opinions O
and O
lifestyles O
. O
" O

The O
question O
is O
essentially O
whether O
, O
under O
the O
difficult O
conditions O
of O
the O
1990s O
, O
the O
level O
of O
democratization O
of O
the O
1980s O
can O
be O
maintained O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
shortage O
of O
personalities O
who O
have O
stuck O
, O
too O
many O
politicians O
seemed O
interchangeable O
, O
" O
a O
bit O
like O
politicians O
from O
the O
stick O
, O
" O
Kleinert B-PER
writes O
. O

However O
, O
they O
are O
also O
a O
mirror O
image O
of O
society O
, O
because O
such O
complaints O
would O
also O
exist O
in O
other O
professions O
, O
in O
sports O
, O
in O
the O
arts O
and O
in O
the O
economy O
. O
" O

Certainly O
, O
" O
Kleinert B-PER
said O
, O
" O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
political O
staff O
has O
declined O
, O
while O
the O
jealousy O
of O
the O
individual O
actors O
has O
increased O
. O
" O

With O
an O
increasing O
tendency O
, O
politicians O
tended O
to O
draw O
their O
judgments O
about O
themselves O
and O
their O
political O
performance O
solely O
from O
their O
mirror O
image O
in O
the O
media O
. O

The O
necessary O
to O
quick O
shots O
and O
spectacles O
, O
which O
sometimes O
makes O
some O
whirlwinds O
, O
but O
then O
also O
often O
quickly O
forgotten O
again O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
liberal O
zeitgeist O
comes O
with O
merely O
moderating O
instead O
of O
leading O

In O
the O
1920s O
, O
they O
were O
thrown O
on O
the O
coastal O
cliffs O
, O
using O
the O
fertility O
symbol O
of O
the O
burning O
sea O
as O
a O
blanket O
. O

For O
an O
aseptic O
note O
it O
was O
done O
to O
the O
German B-MISC
erotic O
photographers O
in O
the O
30s O
: O

The O
free O
body O
culture O
offered O
here O
the O
unnecessary O
reason O
, O
as O
forced O
as O
possible O
, O
to O
produce O
dignified O
body O
images O
. O

Up O
to O
the O
most O
shameless O
, O
aggressive O
images O
of O
the O
current O
act O
photography O
, O
however O
, O
some O
commonalities O
of O
this O
genre O
can O
be O
found O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
the O
body O
is O
used O
as O
a O
solid O
material O
, O
sometimes O
as O
an O
entire O
action O
figure O
, O
sometimes O
as O
a O
fragmented O
body O
landscape O
. O

The O
desire O
of O
the O
performers O
plays O
almost O
no O
role O
- O
what O
these O
pictures O
repeatedly O
reveal O
, O
are O
rather O
the O
fantasies O
of O
the O
lighting O
artists O
, O
projected O
on O
the O
bodies O
of O
their O
choice O
. O

And O
that O
's O
not O
always O
particularly O
fantastic O
. O

This O
is O
especially O
evident O
in O
the O
historical O
distance O
. O

The O
pornographic O
images O
from O
the O
early O
days O
of O
photography O
, O
around O
1850 O
, O
appear O
only O
as O
pictures O
of O
their O
time O
, O
hardly O
as O
erotic O
photographs O
. O

In O
an O
overwhelming O
jumble O
, O
the O
unbleached O
models O
are O
illuminated O
, O
whereas O
the O
long O
exposure O
times O
the O
somewhat O
wooden O
poses O
should O
have O
been O
reinforced O
even O
more O
. O

The O
shameful O
and O
repulsive O
voyeurism O
experience O
of O
the O
viewer O
is O
the O
actual O
aim O
of O
these O
pictures O
- O
their O
design O
secondary O
. O

The O
desire O
had O
already O
disappeared O
from O
the O
picture O
then O
. O

The O
partly O
drastic O
stagings O
of O
newer O
dates O
are O
mostly O
aimed O
at O
the O
same O
old O
effects O
. O

There O
it O
is O
relaxing O
to O
see O
alternatives O
to O
these O
fractured O
beauties O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
breast O
image O
of O
Gundula B-PER
Schulze I-PER
stands O
far O
from O
common O
ideals O
. O

An O
old O
lady O
, O
horrified O
, O
somewhat O
insecure O
, O
but O
very O
seriously O
glancing O
at O
the O
camera O
. O

The O
direct O
look O
out O
of O
the O
picture O
makes O
us O
scared O
to O
confront O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
Voyeur O
. O

And O
so O
the O
woman O
appears O
as O
a O
noble O
portrait O
, O
as O
a O
character O
study O
, O
not O
an O
object O
of O
desire O
. O

Similar O

the O
old O

He O
honors O
art O
claims O

fortunately O
does O
not O

The O

In O
1982 O

parents O

something O
against O

conditions O
at O

Too O
small O

unsatisfactory O

were O
the O
main O
criticisms O

Although O
there O

only O
two O
toilets O

for O
the O

the O
situation O
on O

improved O
considerably O
in O
recent O
years O

The O

bought O
new O
furniture O

set O
up O
a O
modern O

engaged O
an O

and O
a O

From O
October O
, O
even O
a O
family O
nurse O
will O
take O
care O
of O
the O
children O

their O
parents O
. O

In O
two O

the O
expansion O
of O
the O

to O
be O
completed O

His O

as O
quoted O
by O

: O

He O
feared O

" O

That O
was O
certainly O

at O
that O

And O
it O
should O
confirm O
itself O
: O

On O

, O
the O

of O

a O

stormed O

It O
was O
not O
until O
April O
of O
the O

that O
there O

In O
1875 O
the O

was O
shortened O
and O
the O
local B-LOC

was O
converted O
to O
the O
main B-LOC

But O
under O

let O
themselves O

Sometimes O
they O

the O

Petra B-PER

will O
listen O
today O
to O
the O

There O
you O
wait O
patiently O

But O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
be O
excited O

Five O
minutes O
later O
Mrs. O

already O
makes O
the O

" O

It O
'll O
take O
a O

longer O
" O
, O
she O
apologizes O
. O
" O

I O
have O
discovered O
so O
many O
old O
acquaintances O
here O
, O
whom O
I O
would O
like O
to O
welcome O
all O

" O

Shortly O
afterwards O
, O
in O

of O
the O

, O
the O
Christian B-MISC

once O
complained O

" O

The O

" O
she O
says O

" O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
be O
a O
bit O
closer O
to O
them O

" O

Then O
the O
men O
laughed O
; O
three O
of O
them O
put O
the O
table O
in O
front O
of O
them O
. O
" O

That O

, O
" O
praises O
Mrs O

smilingly O
. O
" O

Not O
anymore O

" O

Moreover O
, O
it O
is O
she O
herself O
who O

something O
this O

it O
was O

just O
about O

In O
the O

was O

on O

Every O
year O
it O
serves O
the O
large O

to O
present O
the O
different O
groups O
and O
departments O
. O

The O
members O
want O
to O
make O
some O
advertising O
for O
the O
club O
- O
but O
also O
to O
get O
to O
know O
each O
other O
the O
different O
groups O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
the O
stage O
in O
the O

of O
the O

belonged O
to O
the O

to O
the O

their O
dance O

" O

So O

In O
the O

the O

were O
there O

The O
jazz O

They O
hit O
the O
phosphorized O

over O
the O

The O
highlight O
was O
this O

the O
appearance O
of O
the O
Taekwon O

Do O
group O
, O
which O
only O
formed O
at O
the O
end O
of O

Since O
the O

clubhouse O
is O
finished O
, O
much O
has O
changed O
in O
the O
club O
. O

The O

have O
got O
an O
additional O
large O

a O
small O

" O

As O
a O
result O
, O
we O
were O

to O
the O
two O
Taekwon O

Do O
groups O
, O
there O
has O
recently O
been O
a O
Darts O

Also O
the O

Before O

in O
the O
back O
of O

, O
" O

But O
the O

The O

The O

of O

now O
be O

to O

the O
Greens B-ORG
demanded O
in O
a O
motion O
: O

In O
questionnaires O
distributed O
during O
the O

, O
residents O
could O
express O
their O
opinion O

decide O
on O
one O
of O

This O

the O
Greens B-ORG
argue O
, O
will O

delay O

Even O

The O
CDU B-ORG
, O
the O
largest O
group O
in O
the O
local B-ORG

9 I-ORG
, O
does O
not O

about O
this O
. O

In O
your O
opinion O
, O
only O
a O
more O
sophisticated O
procedure O
can O
guarantee O
that O
the O
process O
proceeds O
democratically O
. O

Every O
inhabitant O
around O
Kurhessenstra√üe B-LOC

receive O
a O
questionnaire O
explaining O
the O
variants O
. O

For O
even O
those O

the O

have O
the O

" O

There O

a O
very O

The O
Greens B-ORG
emphasise O
another O
practical O
point O
: O

" O
We O
have O
been O
discussing O
the O
Kurhessenstra√üe B-LOC
for O
years O
and O
you O
believe O
you O
can O
present O
the O
matter O
in O
a O
few O
lines O
on O
the O
questionnaire O
, O
" O
said O
local O
councillor O
Freya B-PER
Linder I-PER
of O
the O
CDU B-ORG
. O

And O
that O
is O
for O
good O
reason O
: O

Because O
even O
when O
it O
came O
to O
the O
first O
zone O
in O
the O
district O
, O
the O
working O
group O
could O
not O
agree O
on O
formulations O
for O
such O
a O
bow O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
they O
pretended O
not O
to O
be O
neutral O
and O
to O
want O
to O
manipulate O
the O
inhabitants O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
project O
was O
taken O
jointly O
by O
the O
SPD B-ORG
, O
FDP B-ORG

the O
Greens B-ORG

This O
time O
, O
however O

, O
Z√ºnglein O
on O
the O
scale O
, O
agreed O
with O
the O
CDU B-ORG
. O

The O
variants O
for O
Kurhessenstra√üe B-LOC
are O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
easier O
to O
explain O
than O
the O
three O
variants O
for O
the O
first O
zone O
. O

In O
addition O
: O

" O
If O

still O
have O
questions O

they O
can O

, O
the O

In O
other O
words O
: O

Where O
today O
industrial O
ruins O

lie O
, O
purely O
medium O
- O

enterprises O
should O
find O
place O

Because O

the O
industrial B-LOC

to O

a O

that O
they O
can O
still O

. O

The O
route O
from O
the O
planning O
department O
is O
clear O
: O

Producing O
enterprises O
have O
priority O
over O
administrative O
buildings O
with O
their O
glass O
office O
doors O
- O
" O
because O
they O
displace O
all O
others O
because O
of O
their O
solvency O
" O
. O

" O
Simultaneously O
" O
but O
the O
urban O
planners O
" O
want O
to O
protect O
existing O
residential O
buildings O
" O
. O

In O
the O

to O
the O
old O

ski O
slopes O

therefore O
only O
be O
allowed O
" O

" O
, O
explains O

Also O
the O

today O

, O

be O
able O
to O
be O

The O

to O

a O
pure O
residential O

All O
grey O
theory O

Whether O
it O
can O
actually O
be O
implemented O
, O
remains O
in O
the O
stars O
. O

Work O
is O
being O
done O
at O
some O
points O
in O
the O
industrial B-LOC
park I-LOC
- O
but O
the O
big O
concept O
is O
still O
awaiting O
. O

Similarly O
it O
looks O
in O
the O
residential O
quarter O
L√∂tzener B-LOC

Elbinger B-LOC

In O

but O

done O
nothing O

So O
it O
may O

take O
until O
the O

" O
We O

that O

fifty O

" O

If O
it O

the O

money O
must O
come O

of O
three O

Through O
advertising O

, O
the O
club O
tries O
to O
attract O
spectators O
. O

However O
, O
they O
have O
to O
go O
to O
Niederrad B-LOC

because O
on O
the O
hard O

, O
has O
not O
lost O
anything O
in O
performance O
despite O
numerous O
departures O
, O
Hisis B-PER

Finally O
, O
we O

And O
the O
enthusiasm O
is O
great O
, O
he O
stresses O
. O
" O

Perhaps O
it O
is O
also O
an O
advantage O
that O
we O
are O
the O
only O
Turkish B-MISC

in O
the O

and O
we O
have O
no O

The O
meaning O
of O
such O

is O
, O
" O
explains O
Schermuly B-PER

" O
to O
draw O

out O

bring O
them O
to O
the O

They O

one O
of O
the O

The O

is O
much O
worse O
than O
the O

What O
will O
like O
to O

the O

that O

Schermuly B-PER
: O

" O

we O
get O
clear O
with O
that O

The O

be O
a O

The O

that O

puts O
a O
good O

according O
to O
the O
motto O

because O
the O

was O
successfully O
beaten O
in O
the O
hurdle O

through O
the O
preparatory O
games O
. O

And O
to O
this O
day O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
150 O
members O
believes O
that O
a O
national O
club O
name O
is O
unnecessary O
, O
as O
the O
Croatian B-MISC
league O
rival O
Dubrovnik B-ORG
or O
the O
AC B-ORG
Mladost I-ORG
( O
formerly O
Jugo B-ORG

This O
changes O
, O
and O
Cucak B-PER
is O
particularly O
sad O
about O
it O
, O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
fact O
that O

withdrawn O

( O
the O

The O

therefore O
looks O
forward O
to O
the O
jubilee O
celebration O
planned O
for O
the O

20th O

in O

" O

We O
really O
do O

many O
reasons O

Since O
it O

It O

The O

" O
so O
no O

uses O
it O

If O
the O

we O

But O
even O
the O

the O

sometimes O

In O
the O

the O

at O

said O
the O

it O

, O
the O

did O
not O

be O
completed O
in O
1993 O

. O

The O

This O

Three O

there O
was O
no O

wanted O
to O
organize O
the O
municipal O

. O
" O

But O
we O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
give O
up O
, O
because O
we O
took O
it O
shorthand O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
summer O
festival O
could O
only O
be O
celebrated O
in O
October O
. O
" O

But O
by O
now O
the O
young O
people O
had O
become O
involved O
: O

" O
Now O
it O
's O
no O
longer O
so O
much O
work O
, O
" O
he O
proudly O
declared O
, O
meanwhile O
the O
festival O
can O
be O
held O
again O
regularly O
in O
summer O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
youth O
had O
built O
up O
for O
two O
days O
. O

Not O
only O
a O
large O

they O
had O
organized O
, O
with O
the O

were O
also O
prepared O

as O

The O

. O

The O
special O
commitment O
of O
Hermann B-PER
Kl√ºber I-PER
is O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O

It O
contains O
more O

Every O

the O

a O

, O
where O
books O
as O

at O

" O
I O

it O
nice O
that O
so O

- O
a O
wisdom O
that O
is O
not O
always O
true O
. O

Regarding O
the O
renewal O
of O
heating O
systems O
but O
it O
certainly O
meets O
: O

The O
past O
few O
years O
have O
led O
to O
new O
insights O
and O
serious O
improvements O
in O
heating O
technology O
. O

Who O
at O
home O
still O
uses O
a O
heating O
system O
older O
construction O
year O
, O
should O
be O
able O
to O
calculate O
by O
a O
specialist O
once O
, O
how O
much O
energy O
and O
thus O
money O
he O
can O
save O
with O
a O
new O
, O
contemporary O
system O
. O

If O
the O
boiler O
is O
older O
than O
ten O
years O
, O
it O
is O
highly O
likely O
to O
have O
a O
savings O
potential O
of O
more O
than O
20 O
percent O
. O

If O
you O
add O
that O
, O
as O
a O
rule O
, O
the O
maintenance O
cost O
of O
a O
new O
plant O
decreases O
significantly O
, O
the O
investment O
will O
be O
amortized O
within O
a O
few O
years O
. O

But O
there O
is O
another O
valid O
argument O
: O

On O
30 O
September O
1993 O
, O
the O
transitional O
period O
of O
the O
first O
Federal O
Regulation O
on O
the O
Protection O
of O
Immigration O
expires O
. O

At O
the O
latest O
from O
this O
point O
onwards O
, O
old O
plants O
must O
also O
comply O
with O
the O
new O
, O
significantly O
tightened O
limit O
values O
. O

Lower O
energy O
consumption O
means O
an O
increased O
use O
of O
fuels O
. O

This O
automatically O

The O

has O
to O
admit O

And O
Pfaff B-PER
needs O
to O
know O

because O
he O

also O
a O

At O

But O
in O

Molly B-PER

received O
the O

from O

: O

The O

In O

300 O

, O
which O
according O
to O
Molly B-PER
Matthes I-PER
is O
not O
enough O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
club O
is O
not O
allowed O
to O
use O
either O
cellar O

. O

Because O
the O

how O

it O

, O
an O
opportunity O
to O
take O
an O
insight O
into O
his O

He O
explains O
his O

explains O

, O
how O
his O
works O

relieved O

Only O
one O
remained O
skeptical O
: O

Heinz B-PER
L√∂ffler I-PER
, O
his O
character O
Kerweborsch B-MISC
, O
Moderator O
as O
well O
as O
" O
Kerwepfarrer B-MISC

and O
responsible O
for O

the O

Earlier O
, O

stood O
to O
conclude O
on O
the O

" O
a O
mourning O
train O

, O
which O
moved O

to O
the O

accompanied O
Kerwelisbeth B-MISC
on O
her O
last O

Also O
this O
is O
no O
longer O
possible O
: O

There O
is O
simply O
no O
way O
out O
of O

At O

of O

, O
many O

positive O
finding O

Some O

was O
exhaustingly O
fought O
. O

What O
to O
consider O
for O
the O
future O
, O
the O
association O
ring O
chairman O
Ochs B-PER
formulated O
: O

" O
The O
train O
path O
could O
be O
shortened O
, O
in O
strips O
are O
roads O
humane O
. O
" O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
Kerwegesellschaft O
should O
organize O
a O
competition O
for O
better O
jewelry O
, O
because O
with O
the O
festive O
jewelry O
it O
was O
not O
particularly O
well O
ordered O
. O

Even O
the O
ecumenical O
service O
, O
as O
excellent O
as O
it O
was O
also O
visited O
, O
could O
be O
marked O
by O
the O
Kerwe O
society O
even O
more O
festively O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
persons O
responsible O
should O
check O
whether O
the O
Kerwebaum B-MISC
can O
be O
brought O
back O
into O
custody O
. O

Another O
proposal O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
submitted O
by O

: O

" O
Think O
about O

Even O
as O
the O

of O
a O

it O

The O
Hasek B-PER
would O
probably O
have O
drunk O
with O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
bottle O
and O
put O
some O
so O
suffocating O
sentences O
in O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
Schwejk B-PER
that O
they O
would O
have O
taken O
him O
immediately O

Now O
the O

does O

Even O
in O

appears O
again O

again O
to O
characterize O
the O
customs O
in O
my O
host O
country O
illuminatingly O
. O

Most O
often O
he O
is O
called O
together O
with O
a O
certain O
gentleman O
Kafka B-PER
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
had O
a O
slightly O

others O
who O
develop O
a O

open O

Officials O
who O
have O
not O

Sometimes O
I O

there O
he O
is O

the O

But O
when O
you O
take O
a O
closer O
look O
, O
he O
always O
finds O
himself O
as O
a O
human O
being O
like O
you O
and O
I. O

Especially O
strange O
it O
was O
always O
, O
of O
course O
, O
when O
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
Bohemian B-MISC
Schwejks B-PER
in O
Bausch O
and O
Bogen O
was O
attributed O
to O
all O
citizens O
of O
the O
CSFR B-ORG
. O

At O
least O
the O
Slovaks B-MISC
seem O
to O
have O
put O
an O
end O
to O
this O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
with O
their O
hard O
to O
overlook O
demand O
for O
independence O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
it O
has O
created O
a O
sensitive O
gap O
for O
international O
journalism O

Relief O

in O

however O

There O
was O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
last O
century O
a O
Slovak B-MISC
Robin B-PER

who O
took O
the O

the O
rough O

to O
the O
poor O
. O

The O
Hungarian B-MISC
lords O
of O
Slovakia B-LOC
finally O
caught O
up O
with O
him O
. O

Janosik B-PER
was O
the O
name O
of O
the O
folk O
hero O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
know O
that O
the O
Czech B-MISC
saying B-PER
of O
the O
" O
Slovakian B-MISC
Janosics B-PER
" O
is O
not O
very O
well O
heard O
among O
the O
so O
- O
called O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
the O
discussion O
of O
simplicity O
half O
but O
as O
a O
Schwejk B-MISC
substitute I-MISC
. O

The O
brave O

still O
remain O

Anyway O
, O
the O

at O
our O
daily O

now O
always O
looks O
at O
me O
so O
spoiled O

" O

For O
a O

I O

how O
I O

what O

The O

The O
two O

together O

1,000 O
pages O
, O
offer O
less O
a O
history O
of O

an O

of O
French B-MISC

from O

This O
section O
culminates O
in O
1966 O
in O
the O
Structural O
or O
" O
Light O
Year O
" O
, O
in O
which O
a O
series O
of O
major O
works O
were O
published O
, O
one O
by O
one O
, O
whose O
goal O
was O
to O
put O
all O
humanities O
on O
a O
uniform O
basis O
, O
using O
a O
new O
paradigm O
. O

Everything O
that O
followed O
, O
after O
this O
periodization O
means O
decline O
, O
dissolution O
or O
extinction O

Now O
, O
as O
different O
phenomena O
as O
generative O
grammar O
, O
deconstructivism O
, O
linguistic O
statement O
theories O
, O
intertextuality O
have O
actually O
completely O
transformed O
the O
structural O
paradigm O
- O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
radical O
criticism O
that O
opposed O
the O
completely O
surprised O

in O

at O

at O

. O

If O
at O
that O
time O
indeed O
the O
" O
death O
of O
structuralism O
" O
was O
proclaimed O
, O
then O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O

we O
must O
not O
forget O
how O
alive O
he O
has O
remained O
just O
after O
May O

. O

One O
can O
only O
think O
of O
the O
institutional O
triumph O
in O
the O
reformed O
universities O
, O
of O
the O
prevailing O
position O
that O
the O
" O
Lacano O

tendency O
has O
temporarily O
taken O
or O
of O
Foucault B-PER
, O
in O
which O
power O
analysis O
and O
political O
commitment O
could O
find O
a O
new O

In O

there O

in O

goes O
back O

, O
when O

after O

caused O

The O
author O
had O
to O
develop O
a O
very O
own O
biographical O
concept O
, O
because O
he O
knew O
exactly O
: O

about O
this O
mysterious O
and O

Too O
much O
comes O
together O
here O

Althusser B-PER
was O
apparently O
a O
man O
without O
characteristics O
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
as O
a O
professor O
of O
philosophy O
and O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Communist O
Party O
, O
could O
rise O
to O
an O
intellectual O
myth O
. O

But O
he O
was O
also O
a O
mentally O
ill O
man O
whose O
life O
ended O
in O
a O
tragedy O
. O

His O
biographer O
sees O
his O
task O
in O
confronting O
this O
myth O
with O
the O
biographical O
reality O
to O
destroy O
it O
. O

By O
means O
of O
diverse O
, O
new O
sources O
, O
he O
carefully O
tries O
to O
penetrate O
the O
imaginary O
world O
of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
slaughtered O
his O
wife O
. O

On O
500 O
pages O
he O
passes O
through O
that O
time O
, O
in O
which O
Althusser B-PER
was O
still O
completely O
unknown O
and O
in O
which O
the O
key O
to O
understanding O
the O
mystery O
must O
lie O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Algerian B-MISC
childhood O
, O
who O
has O
been O
thoroughly O
poisoned O
by O
an O
anti O
- O
body O
mother O
( O
and O
" O

torn O
, O
brilliant O
brother O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
whom O
she O
was O
supposed O
to O
marry O
! O

Thus O
, O
the O
child O
was O
already O
compelled O
by O
the O
tormenting O
, O
life O
- O
changing O
insight O
to O
have O
no O
own O
existence O

not O
to O

for O
itself O

This O
document O
, O
colloquially O

correctly O
called O

reads O
as O
a O
desperate O
( O

of O
a O

who O

his O

for O
the O
manifesto O
, O
threatening O

It O

only O

Whether O

all O

This O
long O

is O
currently O
being O
discussed O
in O
the O

after O
an O
expert O
group O
of O
the O
" O
Association B-ORG
for I-ORG
Neonatology I-ORG
" O
( O

came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
in O
an O
opinion O
that O
the O
" O
active O
cessation O
of O
life O
" O
could O
be O
acceptable O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
. O

A O
pediatrician O
, O
so O
explained O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
group O
, O
Cornelius B-PER
Versluys I-PER
, O
who O
ends O
the O
baby O

, O
also O
acts O
sensibly O
, O
stating O
in O
the O
death O

the O

" O
and O
not O
reporting O
the O
done O
end O

to O
the O

office O
. O

This O
may O
be O
legally O
reprehensible O
, O
but O
morally O
responsible O
in O
some O
cases O
. O

According O
to O
reports O
from O
Versluys B-PER
, O
pediatricians O
are O
divided O
on O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
killing O
a O
very O
seriously O
injured O
newborn O
is O
permissible O
. O

In O
the O
report O
" O
Do B-MISC

" O

would O
therefore O
make O
recommendations O
on O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
these O
different O
views O
. O

Every O
year O
, O
according O
to O
the O
group O
in O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
, O
about O
300 O
newborn O
children O
die O
because O
the O
doctor O
does O
not O
even O
start O
or O
stop O
treatment O
. O

Versluys B-PER
estimates O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
of O
active O
deaths O
in O
newborns O
at O
a O
maximum O
of O
ten O
per O
year O
. O

In O
the O
recommendations O
it O
says O
, O
parents O
should O
be O
able O
to O
find O
help O
for O
their O
child O
with O
a O
doctor O
who O
has O
an O
understanding O
of O
their O
life O
view O
. O

The O
doctor O
and O
parents O
should O
agree O
on O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
child O
. O

This O
could O
in O
one O
case O
mean O
relief O
for O
death O
, O
in O
the O
other O
case O
not O
. O

If O
a O
doctor O
is O
not O
willing O
to O
end O
the O
child O
's O
life O
while O
the O
parents O
wanted O
it O
, O
he O
must O
ensure O
that O
the O
parents O
find O
the O
way O
to O
another O
doctor O
who O
fulfills O
their O
wish O
. O

Newborns O
, O
to O
which O
the O
recommendations O
refer O
, O
are O
babies O
who O
are O
not O
older O
than O
four O
weeks O
and O
need O
a O
life O
- O
long O
care O

These O
included O
, O
for O

, O
children O
with O
an O
open O
back O
, O
with O
paralysis O
at O
the O

, O
with O

brain O
damage O
, O
for O
whom O
there O
is O
no O
prospect O
of O
a O
life O
of O
sufficient O
quality O
. O

Versluys B-PER
personally O
considers O
it O
acceptable O
to O
actively O
end O
the O
life O
of O
such O
babies O
if O
the O
parents O
so O
wished O
. O

The O
report O
of O
the O
Group O
of O

sets O
out O
criteria O
that O
are O
considered O
to O
determine O
the O
quality O

: O

Can O
the O
child O
later O
think O
for O
himself O

Can O
it O
take O
care O
of O
itself O
to O
some O
extent O

can O
it O
be O

at O

it O

Will O
it O
suffer O
urgently O
? O

And O
: O

How O
long O

Versluys B-PER
advocates O
that O
the O
pediatrician O
, O
who O
has O
actively O
ended O
the O
life O
of O
a O
severely O
damaged O

, O
report O
this O
to O
the O

It O
regrets O
, O
however O
, O
that O
there O
are O
no O
legal O
rules O
for O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
judiciary O
considers O
and O
accepts O
active O
cessation O
of O
life O
as O
an O
emergency O
. O

The O
working O
group O
finds O
that O
, O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
the O
doctor O
himself O
should O
consider O
whether O
he O
considers O
it O
appropriate O
to O
inform O
the O
prosecutor O
about O
his O
actions O
or O
not O
. O

A O

, O
it O
says O
, O
could O
cause O

reported O
so O
far O
mainly O
on O
the O

cities O

Sarajevo B-LOC

It O
is O
not O

how O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
people O
in O
these O
cities O
could O
be O
improved O
by O

everything O

lives O
of O
the O
defenseless O
, O
i.e. O
women O
, O
children O
, O
old O
people O
, O

It O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
to O
bring O
food O
to O
these O
people O
, O
to O
then O
leave O
them O

the O
hail O
of O

while O
you O
go O

How O
should O
such O
an O
action O
be O
dealt O
with O
at O
all O
? O

An O
auxiliary O

approaches O

this O

Should O

should O
the O

Both O
seem O
unrealistic O

There O
is O

only O
one O
way O
to O
provide O
humanitarian O

All O

must O
be O

is O
no O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
question O
arises O
whether O
the O
Bosnians B-MISC
want O
the O
free O
deportation O
of O
women O
and O
children O
at O
all O
. O

They O
may O
reject O
it O
because O
it O
could O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
renunciation O
of O
the O
land O
claimed O
by O
them O
. O

It O
would O
be O
appreciated O
if O
you O
would O
report O
about O
it O
. O

The O
Bosnians B-MISC
will O
also O
ask O
who O
feeds O
the O
soldiers O
if O
the O
women O
and O
children O
are O
no O
longer O
there O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
no O
humanitarian O
aid O
for O
civilians O
at O
all O
. O

The O
soldiers O
will O
always O
make O
sure O
that O
also O
for O
them O
something O
remains O
, O
probably O
even O
the O
larger O
proportion O
. O

This O
means O
the O
supply O
of O
food O
to O
support O
a O
leading O
party O
in O
the O
war O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
expect O
that O
the O
Serbs B-MISC
will O
accept O
this O
. O

We O
can O
only O
help O
the O
Bosnians B-MISC
by O
proposing O
a O
treaty O
, O
both O
for O
them O
and O
for O
the O
Serbs B-MISC
, O
which O
will O
allow O
the O
civilian O
population O
in O
the O
conflict O
areas O
to O
move O
freely O
and O
safely O
to O
a O
safe O

are O
no O

if O

not O

these O

the O

But O
if O
already O
before O

even O
before O
a O
parent O

help O
with O
a O

, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O

the O

also O
the O

to O
a O

then O
the O
use O
of O

is O
just O
nothing O
but O
a O
shift O
of O
responsibility O
from O
the O
family O
court O
to O
the O
mediator O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
mediation O
is O
nothing O
more O
than O
to O
appease O
the O
" O
economically O

, O
to O
accept O
the O
often O
ruinous O
consequences O
of O

But O
if O
a O

is O
already O
pre O

then O
this O
is O
probably O
nothing O
more O

only O

, O

because O
even O

is O
quite O
obvious O
that O
everything O
goes O
in O

of O

If O
( O

it O
is O
clear O
before O

who O

Until O

The O
model O

all O

However O
, O
there O
was O
a O
mixed O

because O
it O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
keep O
in O

that O
the O

an O

that O

" O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
naming O
surprises O
. O

When O
Leningrad B-LOC
was O
resurrected O
to O
the O
old O
name O
of O
St. B-LOC
Petersburg I-LOC
, O
one O
wonders O
why O
not O
also O
the O
name O
of O
Kiev O
in O
Marinsky B-LOC
(= O
MarienTheater B-LOC
) O
changed O
due O
to O
the O
revolution O
of O
1917 O
. O

Also O
musically O
the O
recording O
seeks O
the O
compromise O
between O
incompatible O
positions O
and O
finds O
its O
own O
way O
. O

Although O
it O
is O
based O
, O
as O
was O
the O
case O
with O
Sony B-ORG
under O
the O
late O
Emil B-PER
Tchakarov I-PER
, O
on O
Schostakov B-PER
's I-PER
version O
. O

But O
it O
does O
not O
follow O
the O
in O
some O
detail O
. O

This O
was O
already O
the O
case O
in O
Claudio B-PER
Abbado I-PER
's I-PER
Vienna B-MISC
State I-MISC
Opera O
( O
German B-ORG
Grammophon I-ORG
) O
, O
where O
the O
final O
demise O
of O
the O
Old O
Believers O
had O
passed O
in O
Strawinsky B-PER
's I-PER
irrational O
editing O
of O
1913 O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
ideologically O
open O
and O
in O
the O
best O
sense O
of O
the O
word O
epic O
work O
is O
delicate O
. O

Schostakovych B-PER
had O
tried O
to O
round O
up O
the O
supplied O
sketches O
by O
allowing O
the O
fire O
death O
to O
follow O
the O
wonderful O
morning O
mood O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
from O
the O
beginning O
: O

A O
harmonization O
by O
Zyklik O
, O
which O
certainly O
contradicts O
Mussorgski B-PER
's I-PER
historical O
picture O
. O

Gergiew B-PER
now O
goes O
another O
way O
than O
Abbado B-PER
with O
Strawinsky B-PER
's I-PER
fire B-MISC
magic I-MISC
by O
letting O
the O
final O
choir O
of O
the O
Old O
Believers O
follow O
a O
purely O
instrumental O
reprise O
: O

a O
convincing O
solution O
as O
in O
other O
detailed O
problems O
. O

Also O
musically O
Gergiew B-PER
goes O
his O
own O
way O
. O

He O
interprets O
the O
music O
as O
unequally O
introverted O
as O
Abbado B-PER
( O
which O
he O
avoids O
cuts O
) O
, O
turning O
the O
musical O
epic O
into O
a O
often O
chamber O
musical O
style O
. O

He O
can O
afford O
to O
renounce O
any O
theatre O
because O
his O
horns O
impress O
with O
a O
fantastic O
fine O
art O
. O

Also O
the O
soloist O
ensemble O
that O
does O
not O
have O
any O
borrowed O
star B-PER
convinces O
by O
the O
fine O
cut O
of O
its O
access O
. O

The O
absence O
of O
spectacular O
effects O
can O
also O
be O
observed O
in O
the O
sound O
technique O
of O
the O
recording O
made O
in O
the O
bitterest O
winter O
cold O
of O
1991 O
. O

Everything O
works O
, O
even O
with O
correspondingly O
turned O
volume O
controller O
, O
quiet O
, O
some O
also O
clearly O
away O
. O

It O
seems O
as O
if O
Gergiew B-PER
wants O
to O
show O
us O
an O
evil O
history O
from O
ancient O
times O
as O
a O
musical O
behind O
- O
the O
- O
glass O
painting O
. O

This O
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
whole O
truth O
of O
Mussorgsky B-PER
, O
as O
an O
independent O
interpretation O
but O
high O

value O
and O

Hugo B-PER
felt O
only O

For O
three O
years O
he O
then O
moved O
in O

of O
street O

through O
the O
Colombian B-MISC
capital O
. O

They O
sang O
songs O
in O

to O
get O
money O

If O
that O
was O

they O

20 O
years O
ago O
the O
Italian B-MISC
Salesian O
Pastor O
Xavier B-PER
de I-PER
Nicol√≥ I-PER
founded O
this O
program O
- O
following O
the O
example O
of O
its O
founder O
Don B-PER
Bosco I-PER
, O
who O
had O
taken O
care O
of O
impoverished O
children O
in O
Italy B-LOC
in O
the O
past O
century O
. O

" O
The O
program O
aims O
firstly O
to O
humanize O
the O
problem O
of O
street O
children O
and O
secondly O
to O
show O
those O
affected O
a O
comprehensive O
alternative O
to O
their O
current O
lives O
, O
" O
explains O
Carlos B-PER
Lara I-PER
, O
27 O
years O
old O
, O
a O
teacher O
at O
Bosconia B-MISC
, O
and O
adds O
: O

" O
This O
should O
take O
into O
account O
the O
positive O
characteristics O
of O
the O
children O
, O
such O
as O
their O
ability O
to O
work O
together O
and O
their O
group O
solidarity O
, O
which O
they O
have O
learned O
on O
the O
streets O
. O
" O

Carlos B-PER
has O
lived O
through O
the O
four O
stages O
of O
the O
project O
, O
the O
last O
of O
which O
is O
the O
Children O
's O
Republic O
, O
even O
once O
. O

The O
first O
stage O
is O
called O
" O
Friendship O
" O
. O

Father O
Nicol√≥ B-PER
and O
his O
staff O
go O
to O
the O
children O
, O
called O
" O
produces O
" O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
, O
on O
the O
street O
to O
make O
friends O
with O
them O
. O

This O
is O
how O
the O
program O
fits O
the O
world O
of O
street O
children O
and O
not O
the O
other O
way O
around O
. O

First O
they O
observe O
the O
children O
. O

After O
the O
first O
contacts O
they O
finally O
start O
to O
play O
with O
each O
other O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
educators O
of O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
have O
learned O
their O
own O
language O
of O
the O
" O
produces O
" O
who O
speak O
these O
in O
order O
to O
be O
better O
able O
to O
protect O
themselves O
on O
the O
road O
against O
others O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
they O
invite O
the O
children O
to O
an O
excursion O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
, O
south O
of O
Bogot√° B-LOC
, O
a O
place O
where O
the O
children O
relax O
by O
swimming O
and O
playing O
and O
live O
a O
while O
without O
drugs O
. O

Approximately O
90 O
percent O
of O
the O
approximately O
5,000 O
street O
children O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
use O
drugs O
. O

Many O
sniff O
cord O
glue O
, O
with O
which O
they O
strangle O
their O
nerves O
and O
hunger O
. O

Increasingly O
, O
however O
, O
is O
also O
taken O
" O
basuco O
" O
, O
a O
particularly O
dangerous O
mixture O
of O
the O
waste O
product O
of O
the O
coca O
plant O
, O
which O
is O
enriched O
with O
chemical O
additives O
. O

The O
excursion O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
offers O
the O
employees O
of O
Father O
Nicol√≥ B-PER
above O
all O
the O
opportunity O
to O
get O
to O
know O
the O
background O
to O
the O
street O
life O
of O
the O
children O
. O

All O
those O
responsible O
for O
the O
project O
agree O
that O
- O
like O
many O
other O
problems O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
- O
also O
the O
" O
produces O
" O
have O
their O
main O
cause O
in O
the O
social O
plight O
of O
many O
families O
. O

According O
to O
the O
1990 O
state O
statistics O
, O
38 O
percent O
of O
all O
Colombian B-MISC
households O
did O
not O
have O
sufficient O
income O
to O
support O
themselves O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
families O
have O
fled O
from O
the O
country O
to O
the O
city O
. O

There O
, O
people O
are O
driven O
by O
a O
lack O
of O
educational O
prospects O
as O
well O
as O
a O
lack O
of O
medical O
care O
in O
rural O
areas O
, O
but O
also O
the O
lack O
of O
own O
land O
and O
wages O
from O
which O
they O
can O
live O
, O
but O
above O
all O
also O
the O
persistent O
" O
violence O
" O
( O
violence O
) O
that O
still O
prevails O
there O
: O

Although O
the O
attacks O
of O
the O
drug O
mafia O
have O
decreased O
since O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
military O
army O
of O
the O
Medell√≠n B-ORG
cartel I-ORG
last O
year O
, O
but O
in O
return O
the O
aggression O
between O
the O
military O
and O
rebels O
after O
unsuccessful O
negotiations O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
guerrilla O
at O
the O
moment O
resume O
. O

Many O
civilians O
are O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

In O
the O
city O
, O
however O
, O
the O
refugee O
families O
often O
find O
no O
work O
or O
only O
employment O
in O
the O
" O
informal O
sector O
" O
, O
so O
they O
are O
without O
regulated O
income O
. O

In O
Bogot√° B-LOC
, O
more O
than O
440 O
000 O
workers O
, O
about O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
working O
population O
, O
earn O
less O
than O
the O
already O
very O
low O
minimum O
wage O
, O
according O
to O
the O
government O
's O
economic O
data O
. O

Often O
, O
therefore O
, O
both O
parents O
must O
work O
. O

The O
children O
either O
stay O
alone O
at O
home O
or O
go O
to O
the O
streets O
, O
where O
they O
contribute O
their O
own O
share O
of O
the O
family O
income O
by O
occasional O
work O
, O
begging O
or O
stealing O
. O

Often O
they O
then O
join O
the O
street O
children O
and O
break O
up O
contact O
with O
the O
family O
because O
they O
feel O
exploited O
there O
and O
are O
often O
also O
mistreated O
. O
" O

85 O
percent O
of O
fathers O
punish O
their O
children O
, O
" O
explains O
Manuel B-PER
Ospina I-PER
, O
responsible O
employee O
in O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
for O
the O
street O
boys O
, O
who O
is O
responsible O
for O
this O
behavior O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
social O
distress O
that O
leads O
to O
fathers O
' O
frustration O
and O
aggression O
, O
also O
an O
authoritarian O
style O
of O
education O
that O
has O
its O
roots O
in O
the O
long O
history O
of O
exploitation O
and O
slavery O
in O
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
. O

About O
three O
quarters O
of O
the O
street O
children O
who O
participate O
in O
the O
excursion O
to O
Arvelaez O
, O
then O
regularly O
come O
to O
the O
" O
patio O
" O
, O
a O
courtyard O
that O
Father O
Nicol√≥ B-PER
set O
up O
twelve O
years O
ago O
for O
the O
street O
children O
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
gate O
of O
the O
farm O
, O
the O
" O
productes O
" O
give O
away O
their O
drugs O
and O
then O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
. O

They O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
wash O
themselves O
, O
play O
football O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
get O
a O
doctor O
. O
" O

For O
eight O
days O
I O
've O
been O
coming O
to O
the O
patio O
, O
because O
here O
there O
is O
breakfast O
and O
lunch O
, O
" O
says O
the O
13 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Julian B-PER
. O

He O
also O
became O
a O
street O
boy O
because O
he O
was O
beaten O
by O
his O
parents O
in O
the O
poor O
district O
of O
Santa B-LOC
Librada I-LOC
in O
the O
south O
of O
Bogot√° B-LOC
. O

But O
like O
many O
others O
Julian B-PER
pulls O
back O
to O
the O
streets O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
" O
produces O
" O
have O
become O
accustomed O
to O
the O
" O
free O
life O
" O
there O
. O

This O
desire O
for O
freedom O
is O
respected O
by O
the O
employees O
of O
Bosconia B-MISC
, O
because O
in O
the O
open O
institution O
one O
wants O
to O
take O
the O
dignity O
of O
the O
children O
seriously O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
second O
stage O
of O
the O
programme O
- O
whose O
name O
" O
Freedom O
" O
already O
indicates O
this O
- O
the O
children O
can O
go O
away O
again O
. O

But O
here O
they O
already O
have O
to O
comply O
with O
very O
specific O
rules O
, O
for O
example O
to O
eat O
and O
sleep O
and O
to O
have O
conversations O
with O
the O
responsible O
. O

Like O
the O
staff O
of O
the O
project O
during O
the O
first O
attempts O
to O
get O
closer O
to O
the O
children O
on O
the O
street O
, O
it O
is O
also O
attempted O
here O
first O
, O
to O
bring O
the O
children O
back O
to O
their O
families O
. O

Because O
" O
the O
best O
institution O
is O
the O
true O
family O
" O
, O
Carlos B-PER
Lara I-PER
and O
Manuel B-PER
Ospina I-PER
are O
convinced O
of O
this O
. O

However O
, O
they O
make O
the O
experience O
that O
the O
children O
usually O
return O
there O
only O
for O
a O
short O
time O
, O
then O
they O
come O
back O
to O
the O
" O
patio O
" O
. O

They O
start O
again O
from O
the O
front O
, O
what O
those O
who O
once O
left O
have O
to O
do O
for O
educational O
reasons O
. O
" O

Usually O
a O
child O
leaves O
the O
program O
three O
times O
until O
it O
really O
knows O
this O
, O
Carlos B-PER
again O
points O
out O
that O
the O
" O
produces O
" O
have O
not O
learned O
to O
appreciate O
freedom O
on O
the O
streets O
. O

In O
the O
third O
stage O
, O
which O
is O
called O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
, O
the O
children O
then O
finally O
draw O
a O
line O
under O
their O
past O
. O

As O
a O
symbolic O
gesture O
for O
this O
, O
they O
solemnly O
burn O
their O
candlestick O
clothes O
. O

Father O
Nicol√≥ B-PER
understands O
this O
stage O
as O
a O
playful O
introduction O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
. O

Now O
the O
children O
go O
to O
school O
regularly O
and O
learn O
handicrafts O
in O
a O
workshop O
and O
in O
ceramic O
crucibles O
. O

When O
the O
caregivers O
finally O
gain O
the O
impression O
that O
a O
child O
has O
become O
mature O
, O
it O
moves O
to O
the O
children O
's O
republic O
" O
La B-LOC
Florida I-LOC
" O
, O
where O
currently O
355 O
young O
people O
live O
, O
study O
and O
work O
. O

While O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
first O
stages O
of O
Father O
Nicol√≥ B-PER

program O
are O
located O
in O
the O

where O
most O

" O
is O
located O
in O
a O
quiet O

" O

Thus O
, O
the O
environment O
contributes O
to O
education O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
the O
hectic O
life O

Background O
: O

On O
Friday O
, O
September O
5 O
, O
1986 O
, O
Landrat O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
and O
his O
deputy O
Pipa B-PER
breathed O
deeply O
through O
the O
Schlo√überghalle B-LOC
Nidderau I-LOC
. O

They O
were O
elected O
to O
the O
leadership O
positions O
in O
the O
Landratsamt O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
Greens B-MISC
. O

The O
main O
officials O
of O
the O
CDU B-ORG
and O
FDP B-ORG
had O
to O
clear O
their O
chairs O
. O

Red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
blooming O
spaces O
of O
that O
time O
have O
now O
been O
torn O
apart O
. O

The O
last O
" O
great O
act O
" O
: O

After O
tough O
rounds O
of O
negotiations O
, O
the O
SPD B-ORG
was O
able O
to O
pass O
the O
1992/93 O
double O
budget O
last O
year O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
. O

Then O
the O
SPD B-ORG
stumbled O
into O
a O
voting O
disaster O
in O
the O
county O
day O
in O
the O
poll O
. O

Even O
if O
not O
wanted O
, O
the O
NPD B-ORG
became O
fertile O
at O
once O
as O

brown O
sparkle O

scale O

The O
sharper O
line O
taken O
by O
Landrat O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
and O
his O
deputy O
Pipa B-PER
on O
the O
asylum O
issue O
documents O
that O
there O
is O
no O
longer O
any O
consensus O
between O
the O
SPD B-ORG
and O
the O
Greens B-ORG
in O
the O
circle O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

While O
the O
two O
chief O
officials O
openly O
accuse O
the O
country O
of O
failing O
due O
to O
the O
conditions O
in O
the O
Coleman B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
, O
which O
were O
converted O
to O
refugee O

, O
and O
return O
buses O
with O
asylum O
seekers O
( O
the O
FR B-ORG
reported O
) O
, O
Greens B-ORG
find O
it O
" O
wretched O
and O
reprehensible O
when O
asylum O
debates O
get O
a O
voice O
- O
raising O
character O
" O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
buses O
with O
refugees O
are O
sent O
back O
from O
Main B-LOC
- I-LOC
Kinzig I-LOC
- O
Kreis O
is O
not O
an O
isolated O
case O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
1986 O
, O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
, O
then O
still O
leader B-MISC
of O
the O
SPD O
in O
the O
Main O
- O
Kinzig B-ORG
parliament I-ORG
, O
praised O
that O
the O
CDU B-MISC
- I-MISC
led I-MISC
circle O
had O
refused O
to O
accept O
a O
group O
of O
asylum O
seekers O
. O

In O
a O
current O
hour O
, O
this O
was O
described O
by O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
as O
" O
no O
serious O
action O
" O
. O

The O
asylum O
seekers O
had O
" O
precedented O
themselves O
at O
best O
as O
a O
beach O
property O
, O
" O
the O
current O
Land O
Council O
said O
at O
the O
time O
. O

If O
the O
SPD B-ORG
wants O
Erich B-PER
Pipa I-PER
to O
be O
re O
- O
elected O
to O
the O
First O
District O
Member O
next O
Friday O
in O
that O
same O
Schlo√überg B-LOC
Hall I-LOC
, O
it O
needs O
two O
additional O
votes O
from O
another O
camp O
in O
addition O
to O
its O
own O
. O

The O
Greens B-ORG
had O
already O
allowed O
Pipa B-PER
not O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
secret O
ballot O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
CDU B-ORG
has O
resisted O
speculation O
that O
in O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
Union O
there O
would O
be O
allegedly O
" O

who O
would O
have O
fought O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
First O

Pipa B-PER
, O
according O
to O
his O
own O
statements O
, O
" O
in O
no O
way O
wants O
to O
be O
voted O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
neo B-MISC
- I-MISC
Nazis I-MISC
" O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
he O
considers O
it O
necessary O
that O
the O
position O
of O
the O
First O
Circle O

does O
not O
remain O
unfilled O
for O
months O
. O

Pipa B-PER
, O
who O
has O
already O
accused O
journalists O
who O
have O
fallen O
into O
disgrace O
with O
abstractions O
, O
appeals O
to O
district O
lawmakers O
not O
to O
shirk O
their O
responsibilities O
. O

Thus O
he O
has O
already O
publicly O
stated O
that O
" O
another O

must O
run O
if O
I O
am O
not O

The O

would O
then O
have O

As O
he O

- O
emphasized O
in O
the O
FR B-MISC
debate I-MISC
, O
dioxins O
have O
always O
existed O
in O
the O
ecosystem O
. O

Dioxins O
originate O
almost O
at O
every O
combustion O
process O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
halogens O
( O
a O
group O
of O

elements O

etc O
. O
) O
. O

Editorial O
) O
, O
at O
every O
forest O

and O
in O
every O

. O

100 O
percent O
of O
dioxins O
are O
not O
to O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
environment O
, O
which O
is O
why O
he O
considers O
demands O
by O
the O
Hanau B-MISC
Greens B-ORG
for O
zero O
emissions O
from O
the O
urban O
crematorium O
unreasonable O
. O

The O
crematorium O
was O
identified O
by O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Commercial O
Supervision O
as O
one O
of O
the O
sources O
of O
the O
burden O
. O

According O
to O
Neidhardt B-PER
, O
this O
corresponds O
to O
one O
axis O
of O
the O
total O
load O
. O

The O
remaining O
sources O
are O
still O
unknown O
. O

Morlock B-PER
's I-PER
thesis O
contradicts O
the O
BUND B-MISC
scientist I-MISC
Rolf B-PER
Neidhardt I-PER
decidedly O
. O

Dioxins O
have O
only O
existed O
in O
the O
ecosystem O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
chlorochemistry O
. O

In O
raw O
oil O
, O
coal O
or O
also O
in O
mummified O
, O
centuries O
- O
old O
Eskimo O
larvae O
, O
no O
traces O
of O
dioxin O
have O
been O
discovered O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
scientific O
investigations O
into O
wood O
combustion O
would O
only O
have O
revealed O
high O
dioxin O
concentrations O
if O
, O
for O
example O
, O
PVC O
was O
added O
. O

According O
to O
Neidhardt B-PER
, O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O
so O
dramatically O
in O
recent O
years O
that O
the O
federal O
government O
considers O
public O
aid O
necessary O
and O
pleads O
for O
the O
closure O
of O
unnecessary O
sources O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
BUND B-ORG
sees O
the O
urban O
crematorium O
and O
speaks O
out O
against O
the O
incineration O
of O
people O
in O
whose O
fat O
tissue O
dioxin O
concentrates O
ablagere O
. O

Although O
Gerhard B-PER
Morlock I-PER
does O
not O
disagree O
with O
the O
view O
that O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxin O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O
. O

However O
, O
he O
considers O
the O
installation O
of O
for O
example O
an O
electric O
filter O
in O
the O
plant O
to O
be O
sufficient O
to O
meet O
the O
limit O
value O
. O
" O

I O
think O
the O
bit O
of O
exhaust O
from O
the O
crematorium O
is O
inconceivable O
, O
" O
said O
Morlock B-PER
. O

He O
sees O
the O
" O
huge O
amounts O
of O
smoke O
gas O
at O
the O
Staudinger B-LOC
power O
plant O
" O
as O
a O
potentially O
much O
greater O
source O
of O
load O
. O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
it O
should O
be O
measured O
there O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
per O
cubic O
meter O
of O
exhaust O
will O
probably O
hardly O
be O
measurable O
, O
nevertheless O
the O
enormous O
amount O
of O
load O
adds O
. O

view O
that O
Neidhardt B-PER

" O

There O
are O
many O

" O

For O
him O
, O
the O
danger O
of O

is O
closely O
linked O
to O
the O
expression O
of O
personality O
, O
and O
it O
is O
precisely O
here O
that O
the O
trained O

should O
begin O
. O

In O
elementary O
school O
they O
have O
the O
opportunity O
, O
through O
the O
relatively O
close O
contact O
with O
the O
pupils O
, O
to O
guide O
their O
personal O
development O
in O
positive O
ways O
. O

The O
children O
must O
learn O
to O
say O
" O
no O
" O
even O
sometimes O
, O
and O
they O
should O
develop O
the O
ability O
to O
develop O
real O
social O

" O

The O
sooner O

the O

" O
reaffirmed O
Klemm B-PER
, O
even O
advisory O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
risk O

Moreover O
, O
Martin B-PER
is O
not O
so O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
Emergency O
Regulation O
. O

As O
reported O
lawn O
areas O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
be O
demolished O
, O
he O
fears O
great O
damage O
to O
the O
sports O
facilities O
. O

He O
has O
therefore O
applied O
to O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Government O
for O
an O
exemption O
. O

The O
sports O
facilities O
are O
now O
so O
designed O
that O
they O
can O
also O
be O
played O
after O
rainfall O
, O
and O
well O
drained O
. O

So O
they O
dry O
out O
very O
quickly O
, O
if O
they O
are O
not O
rained O
regularly O
, O
gives O
Martin B-PER
to O
think O
. O

Therefore O
, O
if O
the O
sports O
facilities O
were O
not O
sprayed O
, O
damages O
for O
the O
municipality O
of O
around O
50 O
000 O
marks O
per O
place O
would O
have O
to O
be O
paid O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
rain O
has O
come O
to O
the O
help O
of O
the O
oppressed O
municipalities O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
drying O
problem O
is O
likely O
to O
lead O
to O
a O
fundamental O
debate O
on O
the O
establishment O
of O
sports O
grounds O
. O

Landrat O
Rolf B-PER
Gnadl I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
has O
already O
opened O
the O
discussion O
on O
golf O
courses O
. O

For O
Niddatal B-LOC
, O
the O
mayor O
does O
not O
see O
the O
water O
problem O
as O
dramatic O
as O
in O
the O
urban O
area O
. O

Increased O
environmental O
awareness O

would O
have O
already O

the O

Once O

the O
alternative O

autonomy O

Mr O

, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
ask O
again O
. O

In O
the O
occupied O
territories O
- O
they O
call O
them O
the O
liberated O

- O
live O
almost O
two O
million O
Palestinians B-MISC
who O
clearly O
do O
not O
want O
to O
live O
under O
Israeli B-MISC
rule O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
political O
perspective O
do O
you O
have O
to O
offer O
these O
people O
? O

Steiner B-PER
: O

It O
is O
quite O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
the O
Palestinians B-MISC
will O
not O
accept O
anything O
other O
than O
full O
political O
autonomy O
, O
which O
ultimately O
leads O
to O
a O
Palestinian B-LOC
state I-LOC
. O

If O
Mr O
Virshubski B-PER
wants O
to O
explain O
to O
us O
here O
that O
the O
death O
of O

many O
people O
hurts O
him O
- O
now O
, O
that O
hurts O
us O
all O

As O
long O
as O
the O
Intifada B-MISC
did O
not O
exist O
, O
the O
people O
there O
have O
lived O
very O
well O

they O

they O

when O

the O

in O

there O

unfortunately O
victims O

L√ºders B-PER

I O
want O

leave O
your O
interpretation O
of O
the O
Intifada B-MISC
aside O

Once O

: O

What O
kind O
of O

do O
you O

the O

Steiner B-PER
: O

Quite O

To O

a O
good O

We O

Because O
he O
himself O

last O

Verdonk B-PER
has O
brought O
only O
a O
part O

the O

pieces O
: O

" O
If O
I O
take O

I O

so O
that O

It O
was O

always O
so O
, O
" O
that O
every O

equally O

" O
the O

would O

always O
have O
professional O

But O
perhaps O
it O
is O
also O
what O
makes O
the O
art O
of O
the O
make B-MISC
- I-MISC
up I-MISC
. O

Most O
of O
the O
sculptures O
are O
made O
by O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
in O
a O
state O
of O
fear O
. O

Fear O
is O
the O
constant O
companion O
of O
this O
people O
, O
who O
, O
according O
to O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
, O
live O
in O
an O
unimaginable O
, O
completely O
different O
world O
for O
Europeans B-MISC
. O

For O
her O
was O
a O
dream O
reality O
, O
which O
is O
represented O
in O
her O
works O
: O

" O
If O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
dreams O
that O
their O
ancestors O
are O
evil O
on O
them O
, O
because O
no O
one O
thinks O
of O
them O
anymore O
, O
they O
wake O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
start O
to O
cut O
the O
contours O
of O
the O
Grandmother O
" O
. O

Their O
bad O
conscience O
was O
so O
often O
the O
starting O
point O
of O
the O
work O
. O

The O
Makonde B-MISC
also O
constantly O
feel O
surrounded O
by O
demons O
, O
in O
the O
Swahili B-MISC
language I-MISC
" O
Shetani O
" O
. O

Of O
the O
" O
Shetani O
" O
there O
is O
a O
rich O
variety O
. O

They O
are O
mostly O
mixtures O
of O
humans O
and O
animals O
, O
who O
are O
hungry O
, O
drive O
sheep O
's O
neck O
and O
hide O
. O

But O
not O
all O
ghosts O
consider O
the O
maggot B-MISC
to O
be O
dangerous O
: O

" O
The O
good O
spirits O
are O
recognised O
by O
the O
gentle O
and O
large O
eye O
, O
" O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
knows O
. O

The O
sculptors O
also O
deal O
with O
eroticism O
. O

This O
element O
is O
often O
hidden O
under O
symbols O
, O
but O
sometimes O
also O
clearly O
visible O
. O

Sexuality O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
a O
world O
of O
religion O
and O
magic O
, O
a O
uniting O
force O
and O
means O
of O
integration O
. O

The O
fertility O
of O
the O
woman O
stands O
for O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
synonymous O
with O
life O
, O
as O
the O
power O
given O
by O
the O
Creator O
. O

This O
gives O
sexuality O
a O
sacred O
character O
, O
with O
sexual O
organs O
almost O
always O
being O
the O
object O
of O
worship O
. O

Another O
motif O
of O
great O
importance O
is O
the O
tree O
of O
life O
, O
which O
is O
to O
represent O
" O
the O
interconnectedness O
of O
all O
mankind O
" O
. O

They O
do O
not O
live O
as O
we O
do O
in O
Europe B-LOC
as O
an O
individual O
, O
they O
live O
as O
a O
unit O
, O
which O
they O
want O
to O
represent O
artisticly O
in O
the O
tree O
of O
life O
, O
" O
explains O
Verdonk B-PER
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
natural O
people O
. O

That O
is O
why O
he O
could O
never O
answer O
the O
question O
of O
exhibition O
visitors O
, O
as O
the O
respective O
artist O
was O
called O
. O
" O

Since O
no O
one O
signs O
his O
work O
, O
as O
with O
us O
, O
where O
the O
name O
is O
often O
more O
important O
than O
the O
actual O
work O
of O
art O
" O
. O

The O
exhibits O
shown O
in O
Hanau B-LOC
convey O
something O
awkward O
, O
they O
express O
what O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
may O
have O
felt O
during O
the O
production O
. O

The O
magical O
world O
from O
which O
they O
come O
, O
is O
omnipresent O
, O
even O
capable O
of O
infusing O
the O

for O

of O

In O

up O
seven O

the O

When O

he O
was O

even O
free O

That O
he O
accepted O

about O
170 O

far O
to O
a O
place O
where O
the O
tons O
could O
have O

he O
refused O
. O

Finally O
stands O
in O
the O
waste O
sink O
that O
the O
garbage O
will O
be O
picked O
up O
at O
the O
property O

Therefore O
, O
he O
demanded O
a O
corresponding O
reduction O
in O
fees O
, O
but O
also O
the O
judges O
granted O
him O
a O
deduction O
. O

They O
relied O
( O
like O
the O

) O
on O
a O
different O
passport O
of O
the O
statute O

This O
means O
, O
for O

, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
claim O

normal O
waste O
disposal O
in O
the O
case O
of O
" O

And O
bad O

is O
more O
violence O

Consequently O
, O
the O
statute O

the O
fee O
notice O
were O
legally O
granted O
, O
and O
the O
claim O

a O

declared O

Who O

use O
the O
possibility O

so O
the O

not O

how O

what O
the O

reviewed O
by O
Benjamin O

In O
several O
steps O
Hillach B-PER
then O
tries O
to O
convince O
the O
audience O
that O
these O
protocols O
will O
later O
become O
very O
important O
for O
Benjamin B-PER
's I-PER
theory O
of O
modern O
narrative O
. O

Benjamin B-PER
, O
however O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
understood O
the O
significance O
of O
these O
more O
or O
less O
randomly O
compiled O
narrative O
votes O
for O
his O
theory O
. O

His O
review O
of O
these O
protocols O
had O
remained O
strangely O
colorless O
, O
" O
under O
his O
level O
" O
. O

This O
in O
turn O
explains O
Hillach B-PER
's O
own O
relationship O
to O
death O
with O
a O
Benjamin B-PER
, O
a O
dialectic O
link O
between O
death O
persecution O
and O
mythical O
fear O
of O
death O
. O

Benjamin B-PER
seems O
to O
have O
forgotten O
immediately O
the O
autographed O
statements O
of O
the O
wounded O
and O
dying O
soldiers O
. O

Only O
when O
Hillach B-PER
finally O
pulls O
a O
bow O
to O
Benjamin B-PER
's I-PER
suicide O
in O
1942 O
in O
Port B-LOC
Bou I-LOC
and O
asks O
himself O
why O
the O
writer O
then O
gave O
up O
so O
quickly O
, O
contradiction O
arises O
in O
the O
audience O
. O

There O
have O
been O
thousands O
of O
casualties O
to O
escape O
the O
access O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
is O
thrown O
in O

And O
: O

For O
Benjamin B-PER
, O
suicide O
had O
been O
something O
real O
, O
imagined O
, O
a O
" O
last O
chance O
, O
" O
but O
also O
a O
" O
heroic O
act O
under O
the O
conditions O
of O
modernity O

" O

The O
atmosphere O
remains O
friendly O
: O

The O
Benjamin B-MISC

among O
themselves O

One O

, O
there O
is O
to O

the O

this O
author O

Eckhardt B-PER
K√∂hn I-PER
also O
finds O
sympathetic O
agreement O
in O
the O
round O
. O

He O
has O
dealt O
with O
Benjamin B-PER
's I-PER
writerial O
self O
- O
understanding O
and O
insists O
that O
an O
author O
like O
Benjamin B-PER
must O
take O
every O
comment O
about O
his O
own O

very O
seriously O
. O

The O
self O
- O
expression O
" O
A O
last O
, O
as O
I O

" O
serves O
him O
as O
an O
approach O

putting O
Benjamin B-PER

the O
tradition O
of O

He O
would O

Probably O
the O

" O
if O

correct O

that O

For O
Heinz B-PER
Schlosser I-PER
, O
the O
once O

historical O
reasons O

The O
years O
after O

were O
troubled O
and O
turbulent O
, O
causing O
many O
young O

They O
were O
longing O
for O

And O

: O

On O
August O

The O
objectives O
: O

, O
active O

. O

There O
has O
been O
little O
change O
in O

during O

, O
even O

says O

refers O

And O
there O
is O
little O
that O
can O

by O

" O

that O

However O
, O
we O
demand O

And O
that O
of O

also O
means O
, O
to O
deal O

and O
current O
questions O

there O
also O
dogmatically O

not O
only O
be O
far O
from O
home O
, O
in O
the O
Kolping B-ORG

goes O
open O
to O
: O

" O
All O
opinions O
are O
represented O
here O
, O
" O
Schlosser B-PER
says O
. O

Talked O
about O
everything O
. O
" O

We O
work O
freely O
, O
are O
not O
under O
pressure O
either O
from O
the O
parish O
communities O
or O
from O
other O
places O
. O
" O

Can O
Schlosser B-PER
imagine O
a O
discussion O
with O
the O
church O
critic O
Eugen B-PER
Drewermann I-PER
? O
" O

Why O
not O
? O
" O

The O
interest O
, O
especially O
among O
young O
people O
, O
would O
certainly O
be O
there O
. O

But O
whether O
Drewermann B-PER
would O
come O
to O
a O
place O
like O
Hochheim B-LOC
, O
Schlosser B-PER
asks O
. O

The O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
has O
also O
critically O
highlighted O
another O
topic O
: O

500 O
years O
after O
Columbus B-PER
. O

The O
anniversary O
was O
for O
the O
members O
little O
reason O
to O
celebrate O
, O
rather O
an O
occasion O
to O
reflect O
. O

Finally O
, O
they O
help O
in O
many O
countries O
to O
mitigate O
the O
consequences O
of O
exploitation O
: O

for O
example O
in O
Brazil B-LOC
, O
where O
a O
project O
is O
to O
stop O
people O
from O
fleeing O
the O
countryside O
, O
or O
in O
Nigeria B-LOC
when O
building O
a O
well O
and O
a O
vocational O
training O
centre O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
only O
far O
from O
home O
that O
something O
must O
be O
done O
for O
the O
fellow O
human O
beings O
. O

Especially O
the O
migrants O
need O
support O
to O
integrate O
into O
society O
. O

Tips O
on O
the O
protection O
of O
tenants O
, O
on O
social O
law O
and O
other O
everyday O
issues O
are O
necessary O
. O

Schlosser B-PER
's I-PER
example O
: O

" O
The O
insurance O
representatives O
go O
to O
the O
people O
's O
doors O
; O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
're O
signing O
. O
" O

So O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
