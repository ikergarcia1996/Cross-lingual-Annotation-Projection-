have O

in O
Germany B-LOC

recent O
months O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
not O
difficult O
at O
the O
moment O
to O
attract O
attention O
with O
the O
publication O
of O
a O
book O
about O
refugees O
and O
expellees O
in O
West B-LOC
Germany I-LOC
from O
1945 O
to O

. O

And O
indeed O
there O
are O
hardly O
any O
serious O
scientific O
discussions O
that O
have O
taken O
up O
this O
topic O
so O
far O
. O

It O
is O
nevertheless O
questionable O
whether O
such O
topicality O
must O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
depriving O
an O
undoubtedly O
pending O
debate O
of O
its O
actual O
core O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
blurring O
of O
the O

between O

and O

In O
his O
book B-MISC

m O

Albrecht O
Lehmann O
tries O
to O
take O
a O
neutral O
perspective O
, O
free O
of O
blame O
and O
protestations O
of O
innocence O
, O
towards O
a O
policy O
and O
its O
consequences O
that O
led O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O

Second B-MISC

twelve O

The O
way O
in O
which O
the O
" O
refugees O
" O
- O
as O
it O
was O
called O
immediately O
after O
the O
war O
with O
a O
pejorative O
connotation O
- O
or O
" O
displaced O
persons O
" O
- O
the O
common O
designation O
since O
about O
1948 O
- O
have O
settled O
into O
their O
new O
circumstances O
is O
not O
clear O
. O

Lehmann B-PER
demonstrates O
how O
the O
" O
refugees O
" O
or O
" O
expellees O
" O
- O
as O
they O
have O
been O
called O
since O
about O
1948 O
- O
found O
their O
way O
into O
their O
new O
circumstances O
and O
how O
these O
experiences O
have O
been O
passed O
down O
through O
the O
generations O
over O
the O
next O
decades O
to O
the O
present O
day O
by O
means O
of O
a O
series O
of O
stories O
, O
personal O
notes O
, O
diaries O
and O
documents O
from O
the O
expellee O
press O
. O

A O
picture O
is O
brought O
to O
light O
that O
is O
unsurprising O
but O
convincing O
in O
its O
compilation O
, O
allowing O
readers O
to O
understand O
a O
specific O
kind O
of O
experience O
of O
foreignness O
. O

The O
respective O
experiences O
and O
their O
overcoming O
are O
presented O
quite O
differently O
. O

Certain O
themes O
, O
however O
, O
emerge O
again O
and O
again O
: O

The O
rape O
of O
German B-MISC
women O
by O
members O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
, O
for O
example O
, O
not O
only O
led O
to O
irreparable O
psychological O
disorders O
in O
the O
women O
themselves O
, O
but O
also O
to O
complicated O
marital O
relationships O
that O
often O
dominated O
the O
lives O
of O
entire O
families O
for O
years O
after O
these O
events O
. O

The O
uprooting O
from O
the O
old O
homeland O
produced O
in O
quite O
a O
few O
cases O
forms O
of O
social O
over O
- O
adaptation O
, O
which O
caused O
difficulties O
with O
the O
old O
- O
established O
population O
especially O
in O
close O
- O
knit O
village O
communities O
. O

A O
" O
sentimental O
insistence O
" O
on O
old O
traditions O
and O
customs O
expressed O
the O
inability O
of O
the O
displaced O
to O
forget O
the O
old O
homeland O
. O

In O
all O
the O
narratives O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
the O
striving O
for O
social O
harmony O
had O
been O
the O
guiding O
principle O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
creation O
of O
a O
new O
sense O
of O
community O
was O
supposed O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
loss O
, O
which O
was O
mostly O
experienced O
as O
cruel O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
pointing O
out O
such O
typical O
difficulties O
, O
one O
strength O
of O
the O
book O
is O
to O
bring O
to O
the O
fore O
the O
differences O
in O
the O
experiences O
of O
the O
various O
generations O
. O

It O
becomes O
plausible O
that O
the O
generation O
that O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
sixties O
and O
seventies O
wanted O
little O
to O
do O
with O
the O
past O
of O
their O
parents O
who O
had O
been O
expelled O
. O

A O
consciousness O
of O
the O
" O
lost O
homeland O
" O
existed O
, O
but O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
sentimental O
. O

This O
changed O
only O
in O
the O
eighties O
, O
when O
in O
Germany B-LOC
a O
renaissance O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
homeland O
again O
allowed O
a O
stronger O
reference O
to O
the O
former O
German B-MISC
settlement O
areas O
. O

In O
the O
description O
and O
reproduction O
of O
the O
stories O
of O
expellees O
Lehmann B-PER
does O
not O
tire O
of O
pointing O
out O
that O
they O
do O
not O
adhere O
to O
any O
revanchism O
despite O
long O
- O
standing O
prejudices O
. O

One O
may O
believe O
the O
author O
, O
who O
understands O
his O
book O
as O
a O
contribution O
to O
the O
understanding O
of O
different O
nations O
, O
when O
he O
calls O
in O
this O
sense O
to O
understand O
the O
old O
homeland O
only O
as O
a O
" O
homeland O
in O
the O
head O
" O
. O

But O
despite O
this O
certainly O
laudable O
attitude O
and O
program O
, O
the O
many O
reports O
and O
stories O
leave O
a O
pale O
aftertaste O
, O
which O
is O
primarily O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
methodology O
of O
German B-MISC
folklore O
. O

History O
, O
as O
it O
is O
written O
in O
the O
present O
book O
, O
is O
reproduced O
primarily O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
those O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

The O
one O
history O
thereby O
breaks O
down O
into O
many O
narratives O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
can O
be O
classified O
scientifically O
precisely O
according O
to O
different O
genres O
. O

Thus O
success O
stories O
, O
tales O
of O
tales O
of O
triumph O
and O
tales O
of O
triumph O
over O
tales O
of O
triumph O
are O
typical O
forms O
of O
narration O
of O
a O
certain O
group O
, O
who O
even O
today O
would O
like O
to O
forget O
their O
initial O
difficulties O
in O
the O
new O
homeland O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
a O
repressive O
form O
of O
storytelling O
can O
be O
found O
among O
women O
who O
have O
been O
victims O
of O
rape O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
this O
scientifically O
derived O
classification O
of O
narrative O
types O
remains O
only O
external O
. O

The O
narratives O
themselves O
are O
central O
in O
the O
form O
of O
presentation O
here O
; O
a O
reflection O
on O
them O
and O
thus O
a O
possibility O
for O
evaluation O
and O
classification O
remains O
absent O
. O

This O
circumstance O
, O
however O
, O
leads O
all O
too O
easily O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
sympathetic O
comprehension O
or O
sympathetic O
identification O
with O
the O
persons O
concerned O
make O
us O
forget O
those O
constellations O
of O
history O
in O
the O
framework O
of O
which O
the O
unquestionably O
cruel O
individual O
events O
, O
however O
, O
should O
absolutely O
be O
presented O
. O

Thus O
, O
for O
example O
, O
it O
seems O
quite O
irritating O
when O
the O
" O
double O
luck O
" O
of O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
from O
Transylvania B-LOC
is O
reported O
, O
who O
, O
as O
a O
ethnic B-MISC
German I-MISC
, O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
join O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
, O
but O
had O
to O
join O
the O
Waffen B-ORG
- I-ORG
SS I-ORG
; O
who O
was O
thus O
able O
to O
save O
himself O
during O
the O
war O
years O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
was O
spared O
imprisonment O
. O

To O
imagine O
the O
luck O
of O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
is O
one O
side O
. O

The O
other O
must O
be O
to O
place O
the O
respective O
individual O
fates O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
and O
the O
years O
after O
it O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
an O
objectifying O
perspective O
can O
be O
taken O
. O

It O
is O
a O
mistake O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
mere O
reproduction O
of O
authentic O
reports O
must O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
an O
adequate O
view O
of O
history O
. O

It O
rather O
bears O
the O
danger O
of O
a O
view O
of O
history O
that O
stylizes O
all O
those O
involved O
as O
its O
victims O
. O

It O
is O
undoubtedly O
necessary O
to O
deal O
also O
with O
the O
victims O
of O
history O
who O
were O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
perpetrators O
. O

However O
, O
it O
should O
be O
avoided O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
to O
promote O
a O
relativization O
of O
history O
that O
tries O
to O
blur O
all O
differences O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
" O
comprehensible O
understanding O
" O
. O

In O
this O
context O
, O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
issue O
programmatic O
slogans O
of O
" O
reconciliation O
of O
all O
cultures O
" O
. O

This O
rather O
leads O
to O
other O
fundamental O
misunderstandings O
which O
contribute O
to O
the O
blurring O
of O
crucial O
differences O
. O

This O
blurring O
is O
most O
evident O
in O
Lehmann B-PER
's O
work O
where O
he O
advocates O
a O
" O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
" O
and O
declares O
this O
to O
be O
a O
perspective O
that O
is O
to O
arise O
from O
a O
non O
- O
revanchist O
Aussiedler O
perspective O
, O
so O
that O
the O
German B-MISC
solution O
to O
the O
Aussiedler O
problem O
becomes O
a O
model O
for O
those O
questions O
and O
problems O
that O
arise O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
immigration O
movements O
: O

" O
The O
theme O
of O
this O
book O
remains O
topical O
: O

The O
question O
, O
how O
individuals O
and O
families O
with O
their O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
find O
a O
new O
homeland O
in O
our O
country O
, O
in O
which O
memory O
images O
they O
carry O
and O
transmit O
the O
old O
homeland O
and O
the O
culture O
of O
the O
region O
of O
origin O
, O
in O
which O
way O
they O
maintain O
contact O
with O
the O
first O
homeland O
. O
" O

In O
the O
equation O
made O
here O
of O
the O
problems O
of O
repatriates O
and O
asylum O
seekers O
and O
their O
respective O
experiences O
of O
foreignness O
, O
the O
fundamental O
difference O
between O
these O
groups O
is O
swept O
under O
the O
table O
. O

A O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
consists O
of O
the O
coexistence O
of O
the O
most O
diverse O
ethnic O
groups O
who O
have O
been O
forced O
or O
willingly O
displaced O
to O
Germany B-LOC
or O
other O
European B-LOC
countries O
. O

The O
foreignness O
experiences O
of O
these O
groups O
, O
however O
, O
might O
be O
fundamentally O
different O
from O
those O
of O
the O
emigrants O
of O
the O
forties O
or O
those O
of O
their O
children O
decades O
later O
. O

The O
latter O
have O
demonstrably O
identified O
with O
Germany B-LOC
despite O
the O
losses O
of O
the O
" O
old O
homeland O
in O

, O

built O
up O
a O
national O
consciousness O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
their O
ethnic O
affiliation O
. O

Such O
identification O
is O
neither O
possible O
nor O
desirable O
for O
immigrants O
. O

While O
for O
the O
Aussiedler O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
homogeneous O
nation O
state O
was O
decisive O
, O
for O
the O
asylum O
seekers O
and O
immigrants O
today O
it O
is O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
heterogeneous O
nation O
state O
. O

A O
concentration O
on O
subjective O
sensitivities O
, O
as O
is O
done O
in O
the O
present O
volume O
, O
should O
not O
lead O
to O
neglect O
fundamental O
, O
objective O
differences O
. O

This O
does O
not O
serve O
a O
scientific O

does O
it O

She O
did O

moment O
it O

something O

Andrea B-PER
took O
the O
initiative O

registered O
at O
a O
clinic O
for O

few O
weeks O
later O
she O
left O
her O

three O
months O
of O

accused O
her O
of O

a O
bad O
mother O

it O
was O
clear O

When O

Against O
the O
loss O
of O
utopia O
in O
sociology O
: O

An O
incitement O
to O
discord O
in O
the O
ivory O
tower O

Sociology O
is O
not O
without O
reason O
suspected O
of O
imposture O
. O

For O
it O
claims O
as O
its O
specific O
subject O
area O
nothing O
less O
than O
the O
whole O
of O
society O
. O

No O
wonder O
that O
the O
society O
thus O
targeted O
reacted O
suspiciously O
to O
the O
occupation O
by O
sociology O
. O

Up O
to O
the O
Adenauer O
time O
the O
lady O
society O
eager O
for O
public O
reputation O
felt O
highly O
embarrassed O
by O
the O
approaches O
of O
the O
sociology O
becoming O
bolder O
. O

Only O
in O
the O
turbulent O
political O
times O
of O
the O
late O
sixties O
she O
gave O
in O
to O
her O
stormy O
insistence O
. O

Blushing O
, O
society O
fell O
into O
the O
arms O
of B-ORG
sociology I-ORG
. O

This O
yes O
- O
word O
has O
led O
to O
a O
covenant O
for O
life O
, O
but O
it O
has O
become O
anything O
but O
a O
fervent O
love O
affair O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
the O
enthusiasm O
by O
which O
the O
expectation O
of O
this O
young O
social O
science O
was O
carried O
at O
the O
height O
of O
its O
academic O
expansion O
is O
gone O
. O

The O
conviction O
that O
was O
associated O
with O
the O
ambitious O
goal O
of O
formulating O
a O
theory O
of O
society O
as O
a O
whole O
that O
would O
be O
both O
critical O
and O
practically O
transformative O
has O
disappeared O
. O

Are O
we O
therefore O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
process O
in O
the O
course O
of O
which O
the O
utopian O
energies O
have O
been O
completely O
consumed O
, O
which O
were O
invested O
in O
the O
enormous O
enterprise O
of O
a O
revolution O
of O
all O
obsolete O
working O
and O
living O
conditions O
to O
be O
brought O
about O
by O
enlightenment O
and O
criticism O
? O

In O
other O
words O
: O

How O
can O
the O
attractiveness O
of O
sociology O
as O
a O
reality O
- O
changing O
force O
be O
regained O
, O
which O
it O
lost O
in O
the O
course O
of O
its O
" O
maturation O
process O
" O
into O
a O
normal O
science O
? O

There O
are O
three O
main O
reasons O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
utopia O
in O
sociology O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
the O
utopia O
itself O
that O
has O
become O
modest O
out O
of O
the O
experiences O
of O
failure O
of O
the O
great O
visionary O
promises O
that O
have O
imposed O
themselves O
historically O
up O
to O
recent O
times O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
reality O
has O
met O
the O
utopian O
challenge O
, O
which O
has O
become O
more O
and O
more O
concrete O
, O
by O
the O
simple O
ruse O
of O
the O
realization O
of O
the O
utopian O
ideals O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
historical O
situation O
has O
taken O
on O
a O
gravity O
that O
allows O
any O
projection O
of O
longing O
for O
a O
completely O
different O
tomorrow O
only O
as O
apocalypse O
. O

The O
wishful O
images O
at O
the O
origin O
of O
modernity O
were O
reshaped O
in O
the O
critical O
tradition O
of O
social O
doctrine O
to O
the O
concrete O
utopia O
of O
the O
real O
course O
of O
history O
of O
progressive O
bourgeois O
emancipation O
. O

The O
ladder O
goes O
from O
the O
fictional O
future O
paintings O
of O
a O
Morus B-PER
, O
Campanella B-PER
and O
Bacon B-PER
to O
the O
technical O
as O
well O
as O
early O
socialist O
utopianism O
of O
an O
Owen B-PER
, O
Saint B-PER
- I-PER
Simon I-PER
, O
Fourier B-PER
and O
Proudhon B-PER
. O

Against O
these O
utopian O
socialists O
Marx B-PER
polemized O
with O
all O
sharpness O
, O
accusing O
them O
of O
being O
mere O
dreamers O
. O

He O
himself O
puts O
like O
so O
many O
things O
, O
so O
also O
the O
utopia O
from O
the O
head O
to O
the O
feet O
and O
comes O
materialistically O
to O
the O
point O
: O

In O
communism O
utopia O
and O
reality O
merge O
, O
namely O
as O
the O
society O
of O
free O
producers O
, O
as O
material O
abundance O
and O
as O
social O
relations O
that O
are O
transparent O
for O
all O
members O
of O
society O
. O

However O
, O
this O
concretization O
of O
utopia O
has O
by O
no O
means O
led O
to O
the O
paradise O
that O
was O
promised O
. O

For O
, O
as O
we O
read O
in O
Horkheimer B-LOC
's I-LOC
diary O
note O
from O
the O
fifties O
, O
the O
heaven O
to O
which O
one O
can O
point O
the O
way O
is O
none O
. O

More O
: O

The O
productive O
forces O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
destructive O
forces O
, O
class O
consciousness O
became O
a O
fossil O
through O
the O
individualization O
of O
life O
situations O
, O
and O
revolutions O
did O
not O
prove O
to O
be O
the O
locomotive O
of O
world O
history O
. O

Rather O
, O
in O
the O
words O
of O
Walter B-PER
Benjamin I-PER
, O
they O
are O
the O
grasp O
of O
the O
human O
race O
traveling O
on O
this O
train O
for O
the O
emergency O
brake O
. O

The O
shock O
of O
those O
" O
normal O
catastrophes O
" O
, O
such O
as O
the O
reactor O
accidents O
, O
which O
endanger O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
species O
, O
has O
woken O
social O
science O
from O
the O
twilight O
sleep O
of O
faith O
in O
progress O
. O

This O
awakening O
finds O
its O
current O
expression O
in O
the O
circulating O
concept O
of O
the O
" O
risk O
society O
" O
, O
whose O
secret O
message O
of O
salvation O
consists O
in O
making O
the O
course O
of O
the O
world O
controllable O
after O
all O
in O
accordance O
with O
an O
enlightenment O
that O
is O
enlightened O
about O
itself O
. O

This O
hope O
for O
a O
" O
reflexive O
modernization O
" O
cherished O
by O
Ulrich B-PER
Beck I-PER
is O
by O
no O
means O
new O
. O

In O
order O
to O
escape O
the O
foreseeable O
catastrophe O
, O
so O
argued O
leading O
sociologists O
of O
the O
Weimar B-MISC
era I-MISC
such O
as O
Max B-PER
Weber I-PER
and O
Karl B-PER
Mannheim I-PER
, O
the O
real O
should O
be O
brought O
closer O
to O
the O
concretized O
utopian O
. O

And O
indeed O
: O

Rule O
of O
law O
, O
democratic O
self O
- O
determination O
and O
material O
welfare O
security O
are O
nothing O
else O
than O
a O
disenchanted O
form O
of O
realization O
of O
that O
utopia O
long O
since O
brought O
down O
from O
heaven O
to O
earth O
: O

Each O
produces O
according O
to O
his O
abilities O
, O
each O
consumes O
according O
to O
his O
needs O
. O

This O
secularized O
ideal O
of O
the O
right O
of O
all O
to O
everything O
, O
however O
, O
sees O
itself O
at O
present O
as O
it O
were O
utopically O
overtaken O
by O
the O
ecologically O
inspired O
" O
utopia O
of O
the O
zero O
option O
" O
, O
more O
precisely O
: O

put O
in O
its O
place O
by O
a O
kind O
of O
general O
ban O
on O
overtaking O
. O

This O
formula O
, O
with O
which O
the O
social O
scientist O
Claus B-PER
Offe I-PER
would O
like O
to O
make O
the O
entry O
into O
the O
exit O
from O
such O
almost O
objective O
processes O
as O
automobilization O
, O
agricultural O
chemization O
, O
wiring O
, O
etc O
. O

is O
not O
much O
more O
than O
a O
residual O
hope O
to O
escape O
the O
unstoppable O
disaster O
due O
to O
a O
generalization O
of O
the O
principle O
" O
free O
ride O
for O
free O
citizens O
" O
by O
pausing O
and O
standing O
still O
. O

Does O
this O
utopia O
of O
voluntary O
standing O
still O
not O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
succumbing O
to O
the O
spell O
of O
the O
omnipotence O
of O
the O
present O
? O

Because O
the O
critical O
power O
of O
the O
utopian O
thought O
in O
the O
science O
of O
enlightenment O
is O
slackening O
, O
the O
dimension O
of O
historical O
formation O
of O
meaning O
in O
the O
horizon O
of O
historical O
target O
perspectives O
is O
fading O
away O
in O
the O
social O
self O
- O
thematization O
. O

This O
vacuum O
is O
not O
only O
a O
breeding O
ground O
for O
ideologies O
such O
as O
that O
of O
posthistoire O
, O
but O
this O
lack O
of O
utopia O
also O
promotes O
fixation O
on O
substitute O
programs O
such O
as O
fundamentalism O
, O
regionalism O
, O
and O
feminism O
. O

It O
lacks O
the O
memory O
of O
what O
is O
unsettled O
in O
utopian O
thinking O
, O
it O
is O
renounced O
that O
utopian O
after O
- O
forward O
thinking O
that O
strikes O
the O
spark O
capable O
of O
igniting O
the O
light O
with O
which O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
better O
society O
is O
accompanied O
. O

In O
the O
face O
of O
the O
risks O
of O
the O
risk O
society O
, O
a O
disciplinarily O
organized O
scientific O
enterprise O
is O
objectively O
overtaxed O
. O

For O
the O
increasing O
destruction O
potentials O
in O
nature O
and O
society O
, O
which O
are O
generated O
by O
the O
individual O
sciences O
themselves O
, O
have O
their O
reason O
not O
least O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
disciplines O
merely O
engage O
in O
navel O
- O
gazing O
and O
thereby O
remain O
in O
their O
ivory O
towers O
. O

In O
this O
imperative O
multidisciplinary O
cooperation O
of O
the O
natural O
sciences O
, O
humanities O
and O
social O
sciences O
, O
the O
science O
of O
society O
has O
a O
special O
responsibility O
because O
of O
its O
object O
reference O
to O
the O
totality O
of O
the O
social O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
sociology O
has O
the O
self O
- O
critical O
task O
to O
clean O
its O
own O
house O
and O
to O
have O
a O
contagious O
effect O
by O
this O
exemplary O
character O
. O

Only O
as O
a O
" O
house O
of O
the O
open O
door O
" O
with O
inner O
plurality O
does O
it O
make O
possible O
a O
process O
of O
combining O
diverse O
methods O
and O
theories O
. O

The O
cognitive O
identity O
of O
sociology O
is O
in O
no O
way O
endangered O
by O
this O
openness O
, O
since O
the O
subject O
has O
stabilized O
itself O
organizationally O
and O
its O
academic O
reputation O
seems O
secure O
. O

Its O
status O
as O
an O
interpretive O
science O
requires O
the O
practice O
of O
extreme O
tolerance O
towards O
competing O
paradigms O
, O
different O
methodological O
approaches O
and O
divergent O
interpretations O
of O
social O
facts O
. O

For O
social O
analyses O
can O
not O
operate O
with O
an O
objectivist O
claim O
to O
knowledge O
. O

Rather O
, O
social O
theory O
convinces O
by O
argumentation O
formation O
, O
that O
is O
by O
empirical O
soundness O
and O
interpretative O
plausibility O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
the O
future O
of O
sociology O
lies O
in O
creating O
a O
unity O
of O
originally O
diverging O
traditions O
: O

the O
experiential O
method O
of O
knowledge O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
the O
hermeneutics O
of O
the O
humanities O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
. O

This O
principle O
of O
tolerance O
in O
one O
's O
own O
house O
implies O
furthermore O
a O
direct O
connection O
to O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
same O
street O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
the O
strict O
cooperation O
of O
sociology O
with O
other O
social O
sciences O
, O
if O
it O
does O
not O
want O
to O
give O
away O
its O
great O
goal O
of O
knowledge O
, O
which O
according O
to O
Horkheimer O
consists O
in O
formulating O
a O
theory O
of O
the O
historical O
course O
of O
the O
epoch O
. O

This O
gigantic O
research O
program O
can O
only O
be O
realized O
if O
sociology O
becomes O
the O
carrier O
of O
a O
communication O
between O
the O
subjects O
history O
, O
economics O
, O
anthropology O
, O
ethnology O
and O
psychology O
, O
among O
others O
, O
which O
together O
engage O
in O
a O
philosophical O
basic O
reflection O
, O
are O
ready O
for O
a O
continuous O
exchange O
of O
individual O
scientific O
advances O
in O
knowledge O
and O
systematically O
link O
the O
empirical O
research O
efforts O
with O
theory O
building O
. O

This O
orientation O
of O
the O
social O
sciences O
towards O
a O
historically O
and O
empirically O
sound O
theory O
of O
the O
social O
to O
be O
elaborated O
through O
research O
cooperation O
is O
only O
a O
first O
step O
. O

A O
second O
one O
must O
follow O
. O

For O
the O
social O
sciences O
, O
which O
are O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
specialized O
, O
are O
not O
only O
losing O
the O
object O
of O
their O
research O
efforts O
between O
their O
fingers O
, O
but O
the O
sense O
of O
their O
teaching O
and O
research O
is O
limited O
to O
the O
work O
of O
the O
cobbler O
who O
sticks O
to O
his O
last O
, O
even O
if O
the O
water O
is O
up O
to O
his O
neck O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
future O
perspective O
of O
the O
humanities O
and O
social O
sciences O
consists O
in O
the O
emerging O
coalition O
of O
the O
human O
sciences O
. O

According O
to O
the O
American B-MISC
historian O
Robert B-PER
Darnton I-PER
, O
a O
new O
type O
of O
subject O
configuration O
, O
which O
in O
consequence O
involves O
a O
dissolution O
of O
the O
traditional O
faculties O
and O
departments O
, O
leads O
to O
a O
surge O
in O
innovation O
: O

The O
one O
- O
dimensionality O
of O
cause O
and O
event O
research O
is O
overcome O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
reality O
- O
scientific O
understanding O
of O
the O
symbolic O
cultural O
system O
as O
the O
common O
reference O
point O
of O
the O
human O
sciences O
. O

Let O
us O
summarize O
: O

Sociology O
must O
firstly O
not O
only O
recognize O
itself O
the O
status O
of O
an O
empirical O
, O
understanding O
and O
critical O
social O
science O
, O
but O
productively O
use O
its O
character O
as O
a O
multi O
- O
paradigm O
science O
for O
itself O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
project O
of O
a O
restructured O
social O
theory O
requires O
interdisciplinary O
cooperation O
among O
the O
various O
social O
science O
subjects O
. O

Finally O
, O
thirdly O
, O
the O
science O
of O
society O
is O
, O
due O
to O
its O
perspective O
on O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
human O
context O
of O
life O
, O
best O
suited O
to O
bring O
to O
bear O
an O
overall O
interest O
of O
mankind O
against O
the O
dangerous O
activity O
of O
the O
sorcerer O
's O
apprentices O
of O
the O
technical O
- O
scientific O
civilization O
working O
for O
themselves O
, O
the O
independent O
individual O
sciences O
with O
their O
particularistic O
rationalities O
. O

The O
present O
task O
of O
sociology O
is O
, O
by O
its O
interpretative O
translation O
and O
mediation O
services O
, O
to O
bring O
the O
sciences O
, O
whose O
differentiation O
is O
irreversible O
, O
to O
the O
common O
denominator O
of O
a O
multidisciplinary O
discourse O
, O
which O
strives O
for O
the O
solution O
of O
a O
question O
binding O
for O
all O
: O

how O
to O
prevent O
the O
catastrophe O
. O

The O
treatment O
of O
this O
existential O
question O
certainly O
does O
not O
succeed O
as O
a O
stroke O
of O
genius O
of O
a O
researcher O
or O
a O
subject O
, O
but O
is O
only O
conceivable O
as O
a O
joint O
work O
of O
all O
sciences O
. O

Seen O

then O
divided O
the O

sold O

In O

The O
eagle O
- O
peacock B-MISC
brooch I-MISC
is O
the O
prototype O
of O
a O
brooch B-MISC
form I-MISC
, O
of O
which O
so O
far O
only O
three O
specimens O
are O
known O
, O
which O
, O
as O
the O
chief O
conservator O
reports O
, O
moreover O
all O
come O
from O
Mainz B-LOC
. O

The O
common O
feature O
of O
these O
three O
disc O
brooches O
is O
that O
the O
eagle O
is O
depicted O
with O
a O
peacock O
crown O
of O
outstretched O
wings O
. O

This O
mixture O
of O
eagle O
and O
peacock O
is O
based O
on O
a O
deeply O
Christian O
meaning O
: O

The O
eagle O
symbolizes O
resurrection O
and O
ascension O
of O
Christ B-PER
, O
the O
peacock O
eternal O
life O
. O

That O
this O
crowned O
bird O
was O
at O
the O
same O
time O
regarded O
as O
imperial O
emblem O
and O
forerunner O
of O
the O
Hohenstaufen O
imperial B-MISC
eagle I-MISC
, O
is O
also O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
chronological O
classification O
. O

Its O
body O
shape O
in O
frontal O
view O
, O
only O
the O
head O
in O
profile O
, O
obviously O
goes O
back O
to O
Islamic O
art O
in O
the O
10th O
century O
. O

Stylistically O
, O
the O
most O
beautiful O
and O
" O
quality O
" O
of O
the O
three O
eagle O
brooches O
has O
novel O
dimensions O
. O

Instead O
of O
the O
earlier O
usually O
broadly O
framed O
small O
center O
, O
here O
the O
dominant O
large O
motif O
is O
surrounded O
by O
a O
now O
narrow O
border O
. O

Another O
indication O
for O
the O
dating O
of O
this O
openwork O
enamel O
brooch O
into O
the O
middle O
11th O
century O
are O
small O
flower O
stalks O
of O
gold O
wire O
at O
the O
curves O
and O
pearl O
wire O
lines O
at O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
peacock O
wheel O
. O

Where O
and O
by O
whom O
the O
precious O
jewelry O
was O
made O
, O
can O
only O
be O
guessed O
. O

Part O
of O
it O
points O
to O
Byzantine B-MISC
or O
Italian B-MISC
goldsmiths O
, O
who O
perhaps O
immigrated O
in O
that O
time O
or O
were O
already O
longer O
resident O
in O
Mainz B-LOC
. O

For O
Mainz B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
high O
Middle O
Ages O
called O
" O
Diadem B-MISC
of I-MISC
the O
Empire O
" O
, O

in O
the O
Salian B-MISC
period I-MISC
the O
city O
with O
the O
most O
royal O
visits O
and O
possessed O
jewelry O

whose O
traces O
can O

by O

raw O

and O

Since O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
jewelry O
dates O
from O
the O
middle O
third O
of O
the O
11th O
century O
, O
it O
is O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
attributed O
to O
Agnes B-PER
of I-PER
Poitou I-PER
, O
Mechthild B-PER
Schulze I-PER
- O

believes O
, O
especially O
since O

them O
is O
a O
golden O
finger O

the O
portrait O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
the O
Emperor O
Henry B-PER
III I-PER
. O
, O
is O
preserved O
. O

With O
the O
deeds O
of O
donation O
of O
extensive O
lands O
and O
possessions O
issued O
immediately O
after O
the O
wedding O
, O
Henry B-PER
III I-PER
made O
her O
one O
of O
the O
most O
richly O
endowed O
queens O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
medieval O
empire O
; O
whether O
as O
an O
expression O
of O
his O
affection O
or O
foresighted O
independent O
provision O
for O
a O
" O
foreign O
" O
ruler O
, O
has O
not O
been O

down O

That O
this O
wealthy O
empress O
could O
later O
have O
pawned O
all O
her O

a O
Jewish O
merchant O

When O

his O

it O
might O

that O

only O

Elke B-PER
Mattmüller I-PER
only O
mentions O
in O
passing O
that O
such O
performances O
do O
not O
fall O
from O
the O
sky O
, O
but O
can O
only O
be O
achieved O
through O
continuous O
, O
tenacious O
rehearsal O
work O

Twice O
a O
year O

usually O
around O
Easter O

during O
Advent O
- O
the O
choir O

orchestra O
of O
the O
Epiphany B-ORG

give O

This O
year O
the O

had O
chosen O
an O
interesting O
mixture O
of O
romantic O
a O
cappella O
singing O
, O
that O
is O
unaccompanied O
pieces O
for O
choir O
, O
and O
orchestral O
works O
of O
the O
20th O
century O
. O

For O
Advent O
, O
a O
program O
of O
music O
by O
Johann B-PER
Sebastian I-PER
Bach I-PER
is O
planned O

These O
concerts O
cost O
the O

a O

stuck O

on O

also O
other O

less O

the O

met O
with O

looks O
not O

" O

Many O
enjoy O
making O

so O
much O
that O
they O
also O
like O
to O
perform O
once O
as O
a O

" O

That O
the O

her O
own O
string O

is O
unusual O

For O

the O

that O
are O
needed O

usually O
bought O
together O

Or O
one O
engages O
a O

That O
is O
expensive O

does O
not O
guarantee O
a O
good O

" O

The O
orchestra O
rehearses O
just O
as O

as O
the O

The O
relationships O
are O
much O
closer O
, O
and O
the O
musicians O
motivate O
each O
other O
during O
concerts O
. O
" O

Elke B-PER
Mattmüller I-PER
gladly O
accepts O
that O
very O
difficult O
romantic O
pieces O
, O
such O
as O
the O
German O
Requiem O
by O
Brahms I-PER
, O
are O
hardly O
manageable O
with O
the O
orchestra O
, O
which O
consists O
mainly O
of O
amateurs O
. O

The O
cantor O
has O
a O
divided O
relationship O
to O
Johann B-PER
Sebastian I-PER
Bach I-PER
, O
despite O
the O
concerts O
on O
September O
20 O
and O
December O
6 O
, O
in O
which O
mainly O
works O
of O
the O
Thomaskantor B-MISC
are O
played O
. O

What O
bothers O
her O
is O
the O
oversaturation O
. O

Every O
second O
year O
cantatas O
from O
the O
Christmas B-MISC
Oratorio I-MISC
? O

That O
would O
be O
too O
boring O
for O
Elke B-PER
Mattmüller I-PER
. O
" O

Many O
do O
not O
even O
know O
that O
not O
only O
Bach B-PER
composed O
good O
and O
interesting O
music O
. O
" O

Thus O
, O
during O
her O
14 O
years O
of O
work O
, O
she O
has O
not O
performed O
any O
work O
twice O
except O
Mozart B-PER
's I-PER
" O
Requiem B-MISC
" O
and O
Johannes B-PER
Brahms I-PER
's O
" O
Schicksalslied O
" O
. O
" O

I O
want O
to O
at O
least O
hint O
to O
people O
how O
wide O
the O
range O
of O
different O
pieces O
is O
. O
" O

Nor O
does O
music O
history O
end O
for O
her O
with O
Anton B-PER
Bruckner I-PER
. O

Her O
interest O
in O
modern O
music O
is O
great O
. O

With O
the O
choir O
, O
the O
cantor O
has O
a O
hard O
time O
with O
it O
. O
" O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
make O
new O
music O
fans O
out O
of O
the O
singers O
. O

But O
everyone O
should O
be O
open O
to O
it O
. O
" O

So O
she O
devotes O
herself O
extensively O
to O
modern O
music O
, O
especially O
as O
an O
organist O
. O

Does O

" O

A O

modern O

" O
- O
that O
would O
be O
what O
she O
still O
lacks O
for O
musical O
happiness O
. O

The O
relatively O
small O
instrument O
from O
the O
50s O
has O
only O
a O
few O
stops O
and O
an O
outdated O
technology O

" O

The O
new O
voicing O
two O
years O

has O
at O

brought O
a O
lot O
in O
terms O
of O
sound O

" O

But O
she O
is O
under O
no O

There O
is O
simply O
no O

As O
the O

, O
Professor O
Joachim B-PER
Wolfram I-PER
Dudenhausen I-PER
of O
the O
Rudolf B-ORG
Virchow I-ORG
Clinic I-ORG
of O
the O
Free B-ORG
University I-ORG
of O
Berlin O
, O
explained O
, O
the O
test O
, O
which O
is O
in O
principle O
harmless O
but O
costly O
, O
if O
it O
provides O
evidence O
of O
genetic O
damage O
such O
as O
neural O
tube O
defects O
or O
trisomies O
( O
such O
as O
Down B-MISC
's I-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
, O
formerly O
known O
as O
mongolism I-MISC
) O
, O
entails O
further O
costly O
and O
for O
the O
woman O
and O
the O
unborn O
child O
not O
entirely O
harmless O
examinations O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
amniocentesis O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
interventions O
are O
unnecessary O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
consultants O
and O
should O
be O
spared O
to O
the O
pregnant O
women O
. O

The O
way O
triple O
diagnostics O
is O
handled O
today O
, O
it O
too O
often O
provides O
evidence O
of O
a O
genetic O
risk O
that O
can O
not O
be O
confirmed O
by O
amniocentesis O
. O

According O
to O
Professor O
Dudenhausen B-PER
, O
these O
deficiencies O
have O
less O
to O
do O
with O
the O
difficulties O
of O
the O
laboratory O
tests O
, O
which O
biochemically O
measure O
three O
fetal O
substances O
in O
maternal O
blood O
( O
alpha O
- O
fetoprotein O
, O
chorionic O
gonadotropins O
and O
estriol O
) O
. O

In O
many O
cases O
the O
significance O
of O
the O
test O
is O
impaired O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
exact O
age O
of O
the O
unborn O
child O
is O
often O
not O
determined O
by O
the O
doctor O
before O
the O
blood O
sample O
is O
taken O
and O
the O
blood O
values O
then O
reflect O
a O
non O
- O
existent O
risk O
if O
the O
child O
is O
older O
than O
expected O
. O

The O
experts O
therefore O
demand O
that O
the O
test O
is O
undertaken O
only O
with O
simultaneous O
age O
determination O
of O
the O
fetus O
by O
ultrasound O
. O

As O
Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
added O
, O
prior O
counseling O
of O
the O
pregnant O
woman O
is O
also O
indispensable O
. O

It O
should O
be O
made O
clear O
to O
the O
expectant O
mothers O
that O
with O
the O
test O
, O
for O
example O
, O
Down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
can O
be O
detected O
in O
only O
six O
out O
of O
ten O
cases O
and O
generally O
only O
a O
small O
part O
of O
all O
conceivable O
hereditary O
defects O
is O
detected O
. O

Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
: O

" O
We O
can O
not O
give O
a O
guarantee O
certificate O
for O
the O

of O

" O

The O
suitability O
of O
the O
test O
under O

spokesman O
for O

says O
: O

" O
Privatization O
entails O
higher O
rents O
in O
any O
case O
, O
a O
large O

" O

A O

would O
entail O
a O

is O
therefore O
impractical O
. O
" O

One O

" O
, O
he O
says O
to O
the O

There O
would O
be O
a O

that O

dictate O

if O
the O

Strentz B-PER

he O

The O
Boeing B-MISC
people I-MISC
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
number O

is O
less O

was O

could O
be O
served O
safely O
enough O
with O

been O
the O
subject O

heated O
debate O
for O
years O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
the O
more O
engines O

has O
, O
the O
greater O
its O
reserves O

the O
" O

are O
called O
in O
aviation O
jargon O
, O
were O
also O
initially O
raised O
by O
the O
certification O
authorities O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
the O
rule O
was O
that O
twin O

had O
to O
arrange O
their O
routes O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
they O
could O

in O
no O
more O
than O
60 O
minutes O
in O
the O
event O
of O
an O

. O

This O
meant O
that O
routes O
such O
as O
the O
North B-MISC

route O
were O
initially O
largely O
closed O
to O
twin O
- O

such O
as O

Boeing B-MISC
767s I-MISC
: O

The O
necessary O
detours O
via O
Greenland B-LOC

Newfoundland B-LOC
cost O
additional O
flying O
time O
and O
made O
economical O
flight O
operations O
impossible O
. O

Under O
pressure O
from O
the O
manufacturers O
and O
the O
airlines O
, O
who O
expected O
economic O
advantages O
from O
the O
cost O
- O
effective O
use O
of O
twin O
- O
jet O
aircraft O
on O
long O
- O

, O
these O
regulations O
were O
gradually O

The O
current O
ETOPS B-MISC
rules O
for O

allow O
the O
captain O
of O

- O

airliner O
to O
fly O
up O
to O
180 O
minutes O
from O
the O
nearest O
landing O
site O
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
twin O
- O

, O
such O
as O
the O
long O
- O

Airbus O
A B-MISC

almost O
all O
surface O

, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
some O
Pacific B-MISC
routes I-MISC
. O

The O
new O
180 O

minute O
rule O
has O
also O
persuaded O
safety O
- O
conscious O
airlines O
, O
which O
previously O
did O
not O
want O
to O
use O

figures O
about O
the O

, O
or O
continuing O
as O

despite O
the O

. O

Such O
an O

can O
be O
a O
serious O
engine O

, O
which O
necessarily O
results O
in O

also O
a O
falsely O

in O

In O
only O

56 O
cases O
mentioned O
, O
Boeing B-ORG
says O
, O
the O
need O
for O
an O
evasive O
landing O
or O

has O
arisen O
. O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
the O
manufacturer O
has O
only O
good O
things O
to O
tell O
its O
cost O
- O

, O
the O

: O

Statistically O
speaking O
, O
a O

- O

Boeing B-MISC
767 I-MISC
can O
be O
flown O
for O
almost O
11,000 O

without O
having O

even O

What O

( O

, O
as O
the O
figure O
created O
in O

is O
called O
, O
stands O
with O
both O
legs O
in O
a O
crisis O
of O
art O
, O
for O
whose O
authenticity O
and O
social O
claim O
artists O
like O
Meunier B-PER
or O
his O
far O
more O
famous O
companion O
van B-PER
Gogh I-PER
struggled O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
19th O
century O
. O

The O
flourishes O
of O
Art O
Nouveau O
, O
the O
rigid O
ideals O
of O
Neo O
- O
Classicism O
, O
and O
the O
salon O
life O
of O
the O
Bohemians O
seemed O
inadequate O
to O
the O
human O
reality O
they O
experienced O
, O
to O
the O
point O
of O
mendacity O
. O

Meunier B-PER
's I-PER
response O
to O
this O
was O
a O
radical O
turn O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
, O
to O
the O
modeling O
of O
workers O
' O
figures O
. O

Here O
he O
was O
not O
concerned O
with O
the O
representation O
of O
the O
misery O
into O
which O
the O
proletariat O
had O
fallen O
through O
the O
industrialization O
that O
was O
not O
yet O
socially O
acceptable O
at O
that O
time O
. O

He O
created O
realistic O

who O
embody O
with O
a O
certain O
pathos O

strength O

pride O

a O
proletarian O
, O
so O
to O
speak O

. O

Such O
sculpture O
clearly O
took O
sides O
with O
the O
emerging O
workers O
' O
movement O
and O
came O
into O
an O
explosive O
, O
risky O
opposition O
to O
the O
contemporary O
conception O
of O
art O

One O
would O
do O

an O
injustice O

equated O
his O
heroes O
of O

with O

The O

The O

It O

Whether O

Nobody O

be O

Hermann B-PER
Schmidt I-PER
suspects O
another O
cause O
: O

The O
castle O

used O
to O
be O
a O
playground O
and O
a O
football O
field O
. O

Schmidt B-PER
, O
son O
of O
a O
stonemason O
, O
said O
according O
to O
a O
report O
of O
1976 O
, O
the O
fountain O
was O
constantly O
dirty O
and O
therefore O
came O
away O
there O
. O

The O
Schwanheimer B-MISC
would O
have O
to O
know O
it O
: O

He O
had O
dismantled O
the O
well O
in O
1938 O
with O
. O

The O
way O
from O
the O
object O
of O
dispute O
to O
the O
fringe O
phenomenon O
was O
only O
a O
few O
meters O
far O
. O

On O
the O
market O
place O
rebuilt O
, O
it O
became O
quiet O
around O
the O
Brüning'sche B-MISC
water O
feature O
. O

1949 O
wrote O
a O
newspaper O
: O

" O
It O
is O
actually O
only O

Höchster B-MISC

They O
climb O

it O

it O

" O

Proposals O
to O
move O
it O
back O
to O
the O
Schloßplatz O
in O
the O
mid O
- O

were O
unsuccessful O
. O

So O
the O
Brüning B-MISC

has O
stood O

In O

But O
only O
when O
the O

gets O
its O

something O
should O
do O
. O

And O
when O
that O
will O
be O
, O
Alfons B-PER
Kaiser I-PER
can O
not O
say O
. O

Only O
the O
cost O
estimate O
has O
been O
on O
the O
table O
for O

: O

The O
new O

will O
cost O
at O

300 O

marks O
. O

The O
city O
gives O
the O
money O
; O
but O
for O
a O
long O
time O
an O
old O
woman O
has O
taken O
care O
of O
the O
source O
, O
and O
that O

The O
lack O
of O
young O
nurses O
in O

on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
the O
shortage O
of O
jobs O
in O
English B-MISC

on O
the O

hand O
makes O
such O
an O
institution O
not O
only O
sensible O

also O
necessary O
. O

And O
so O
it O
comes O
that O
the O

until O

to O
determine O
one O
thing O
above O
all O
: O

That O
the O
German B-MISC

is O
a O
difficult O
language O

The O

some O

When O
the O

asks O
them O
to O
mime O
an O
activity O
that O
the O
other O
young O
women O
then O
have O
to O
describe O
in O
German B-MISC
, O
Emma B-PER
puts O
her O
head O
down O
on O
the O
table O
. O
" O

Emma B-PER
is O
asleep O
, O
" O
guesses O
one O
of O
the O
students O
. O

Ms. O
Beckermann B-PER
also O
notices O
that O
her O
student O
does O
look O
tired O
: O

" O
When O
did O
you O
go O
to O
bed O
? O
" O

Emma B-PER
's I-PER
German B-MISC
is O
sufficient O
for O
the O
curt O
answer O
even O
after O
a O
few O
days O
: O

" O
No O
bed O
. O
" O

Their O
humor O
is O
needed O
by O
the O
young O
women O
of O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORG
when O
they O
begin O
their O
service O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O
" O

In O
the O
Anglo O
- O
Saxon O
countries O
, O
nurses O
are O
much O
more O
recognized O
than O
in O
Germany B-LOC
" O
, O
says O
principal O
Yvonne B-PER
Stringham I-PER
. O

For O
some O
British B-MISC
nurses O
, O
the O
daily O
routine O
in O
German B-MISC
hospitals O
has O
already O
become O
a O
cold O
shower O
. O

The O
language O
barrier O
makes O
everything O
even O
more O
difficult O
at O
the O
beginning O
. O

Therefore O
Yvonne B-PER
Stringham I-PER
's I-PER
sentence O
applies O
: O

" O
The O
better O
you O
know O
German B-MISC
, O
the O
better O
you O
can O
take O
it O
with O
humor O

not O
all O

Not O
only O
the O
poor O

opportunities O

the O

many O

drive O
the O

some O
also O
come O
out O
of O
curiosity O
about O
a O

They O

less O

It O
is O
said O
that O
the O
sewage O
treatment O
plant O
is O
only O
a O
rumor O
, O
and O
the O
waste O
water O
is O
now O
only O
led O
into O
the O
neighboring O
bay O
, O
where O
the O

village O

located O

We O
do O
n't O
eat O
there O
anymore O
anyway O
, O
the O
fish O
tastes O
more O
and O
more O
bland O
, O
and O
the O
waiters O
became O
more O
and O
more O
unfriendly O
and O
once O
even O
really O
abusive O
, O
when O
Heinz B-PER
got O
lobster O
tasting O
like O
goat O
meat O
and O
wanted O
to O
pay O
accordingly O
. O

This O
time O
we O
have O
been O
more O
often O
in O
" O
La B-LOC
Matalla I-LOC
" O
, O
the O
northern O
tip O
of O
our O
bay O
, O
which O
they O
have O
only O
now O
built O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
cute O
, O
small O
bungalow O
village O
with O
diving O
school O
, O
disco O
, O
two O
restaurants O
and O
a O
shopping O
center O
. O

In O
the O
past O
there O
were O
some O
horrible O
barracks O
, O
they O
have O
blown O
away O
together O
with O
a O
small O
forest O
and O
some O
rocks O
that O
were O
in O
the O
way O
and O
then O
dumped O
all O
the O
rubble O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
San B-LOC
Felipiano I-LOC
into O
the O
sea O
. O

Thus O
have O
also O
disappeared O
those O
pesky O
, O
ugly O
seabirds O
that O
used O
to O
nest O
there O
. O

Supposedly O
they O
are O
very O
rare O
, O
but O
last O
year O
there O
were O
still O
enough O
of O
them O
to O
keep O
me O
awake O
for O
three O
nights O
in O
a O
row O
with O
their O
squawking O
. O

Fortunately O
they O
have O
fenced O
the O
whole O
bay O
around O
the O
" O
Plaja B-LOC
Paraiso I-LOC
" O
, O
so O
that O
now O
this O
whole O
rabble O
no O
longer O
comes O
to O
the O
beach O
to O
sell O
or O
steal O
anything O
. O

It O
had O
become O
more O
and O
more O
, O
as O
it O
is O
said O
, O
because O
the O
unemployment O
rate O
in O
the O
region O
is O
over O
40 O
percent O
. O

So O
, O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
this O
. O

There O
is O
truly O
enough O
to O
do O
in O
our O
vacation O
bay O
, O
especially O
for O
people O
who O
are O
not O
too O
fine O
to O
learn O
a O

Although O
the O

is O
already O
quite O

I O
have O
read O
that O
they O
are O
still O

Also O
with O

the O

so O

No O

some O

is O

We O
showed O
Antonio B-PER
some O

Thereupon O

The O

back O

the O
Middle O
Ages O
. O

In O
1232 O
it O
is O
mentioned O
in O
writing O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

In O
1348 O
Johann B-PER
von I-PER
Goldstein I-PER
took O
over O
the O
estate O
, O
which O
from O
then O
on O
bore O
his O
name O
. O

Johann B-PER
cared O
little O
about O
the O
building O
regulations O
of O
the O
emperor O
Ludwig B-PER
: O

He O
prescribed O
that O
no O
castle O
- O
like O
buildings O
could O
be O
erected O
within O
a O
five O
- O
mile O
zone O
around O
the O
city O
. O

But O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
Johann B-PER
von I-PER
Goldstein I-PER
did O
. O

He O
built O
walls O
around O
his O
new O
home O
, O
filled O
a O
moat O
with O
water O
that O
he O
diverted O
from O
the O
nearby O
Schwarzbach B-LOC
and O
built O
a O
drawbridge O
and O
watchtower O
. O

Briefly O
: O

The O
modest O
farmstead O
became O
a O
moated O
castle O
, O
which O
was O
to O
withstand O
conquest O
. O

The O
council O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Frankfurt B-LOC
was O
anything O
but O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
accomplished O
facts O
. O

The O
eager O
castle O
builder O
nevertheless O
got O
off O
lightly O
. O

Although O
the O
city O
fathers O
would O
have O
had O
the O
right O
to O
tear O
down O
the O
castle O
, O
they O
let O
Johann B-PER
von I-PER
Goldstein I-PER
. O

After O
the O
death O
of O
the O
lord O
of O
the O
castle O
, O
the O
city O
acquired O
the O
estate O
around O
1400 O
for O
800 O
gulden O
. O

About O
150 O
years O
later O
, O
Margrave O
Achilles B-PER
of I-PER
Brandenburg I-PER
had O
the O
fortress O
burned O
down O
: O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
16th O
century O
Achilles B-PER
was O
in O
retreat O
in O
the O
Schmalkaldic B-MISC
War I-MISC
after O
a O
failed O
siege O
of O
Frankfurt B-LOC
. O

In O
his O
rage O
he O
had O
the O
castle O
set O
on O
fire O
, O
which O
from O
then O
on O
lay O
fallow O
. O

In O
the O
18th O
century O
the O
remaining O
buildings O
were O
inhabited O
by O
foresters O
until O
Jakob B-PER
Grein I-PER
inherited O
the O
Goldstein B-LOC
estate I-LOC
in O
1818 O
. O

He O
developed O
it O
into O
a O
farm O
with O
barns O
and O
a O
brandy O
house O
. O

In O
1839 O
he O
had O
the O
manor O

, O
which O
today O

the O
only O

two O

this O
so O

called O

in O

Furetière B-PER
delightfully O

plays O
his O

his O
literary O
expectations O

are O
actually O
two O
different O
milieu O

but O
finally O
one O
also O
understands O
, O
that O
this O

always O
had O
to O
take O
a O
back O
seat O
beside O
the O
Roman O
Comique O

by O

For O
mercury O
this O

that O

The O

The O

Our O

In O
the O

even O
only O

were O
registered O
. O

Even O

no O

That O
create O
at O
present O
only O
very O
best O
Diesel O
like O
the O
new O
Audi-80 B-MISC
- I-MISC

- O

And O
from O
it O
it O
becomes O
clear O
that O
the O
Toyota B-MISC

with O
this O
cultivated O
running O
, O
elastic O
and O
nevertheless O
sufficiently O
high O

practically O
the O
famous O
" O

" O
succeeded O
: O

A O
cultivated O
Otto O
engine O
with O
the O
consumption O
behavior O
of O
a O
good O
diesel O
. O

This O
engineering O
achievement O
can O
no O
longer O
be O
devalued O
by O
whispering O
behind O
closed O
doors O
that O
this O
engine O
is O
" O
simply O
miserable O
" O
in O
terms O
of O
exhaust O
emissions O
outside O
the O
European B-MISC
emissions I-MISC
standard I-MISC
. O

What O
was O
indeed O
true O
for O
the O
first O
attempts O
at O
this O
engine O
concept O
- O
excessive O
nitrogen O
oxide O
emissions O
- O
is O
no O
longer O
an O
issue O
today O
, O
according O
to O
data O
provided O
by O
Toyota B-ORG
. O

The O
lean O
- O
mix B-MISC
Carina I-MISC
of O
the O
latest O
generation O
meets O
not O
only O
the O
strict O
U.S. B-MISC
standard I-MISC
, O
which O
covers O
speed O
peaks O
up O
to O
about O
90 O
km O
/ O
h O
, O
but O
also O
the O
new O
ECE B-MISC
emission I-MISC
test I-MISC
cycle I-MISC
, O
which O
requires O
up O
to O
120 O
km O
/ O
h O
the O
safe O
compliance O
with O
U.S. B-MISC
values I-MISC
and O
that O
over O
a O
running O
time O
of O
80 O
000 O
kilometers O
. O

So O
there O
is O
a O
new O
offer O
for O
the O
ecologically O
responsible O
car O
buyer O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
because O
the O
simple O
rule O
still O
applies O
that O
every O
liter O
of O
fuel O
not O
burned O
is O
the O
best O
contribution O
to O
environmental O
protection O
. O

The O
modern O
diesel O
engine O
receives O
with O
this O
Toyota B-MISC
concept I-MISC
for O
gasoline O
engines O
undoubtedly O
a O
new O
competition O
, O
because O
its O
past O
consumption O
advantage O
shrinks O
with O
such O
consumption O
behavior O
in O
the O
usual O
traffic O
everyday O
life O
nearly O
on O
zero O
. O

This O
in O
turn O
will O
certainly O
inspire O
the O
diesel O
engineers O
to O
new O
efforts O
. O

At O
present O
however O
the O
Toyota B-MISC
engineers I-MISC
must O
be O
certified O
: O

Nobody O
in O
Europe B-LOC
has O
been O
able O
to O
optimize O
the O
classic O
gasoline O

ecologically O
as O
consistently O

The O
economic O
upswing O
in O
the O
country O
, O
albeit O
limited O
to O

has O
given O
rise O
to O
a O
self O

that O
no O

sees O
its O
future O
in O
the O
autocracy O

but O
in O

In O
the O
60 O

of O
so O

called O
democracy O
, O
generals O
have O
held O
the O
post O
of O
prime O

for O
46 O
years O
. O

The O
demonstrators O
did O
not O
want O
to O
accept O
this O
any O
more O
. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
not O
only O
students O
but O
yuppies O
, O
young O
businessmen O
and O
middle O

class O

rebelled O
against O
the O

. O

Only O
a O
word O
of O
power O
of O
the O
king O
ended O
the O
bloodbath O
in O
the O
streets O
of B-LOC
Bangkok I-LOC
at O
that O
time O

Suchinda B-PER

protected O

comfortably O

has O
so O

Almost O
after O
his O

again O
a O

of O
the O

became O
head O
of O

, O
if O
the O

So O
Anand B-PER

Almost O
all O
Thai B-LOC

agree O
that O
the O
enormous O
influence O
of O
the O
military O
must O
be O
curbed O

The O

practically O

nothing O

In O

the O

For O
the O

in O

, O
the O
military O
once O
again O
reckons O
with O
good O
chances O
, O
especially O
since O
the O

Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
Lersner B-PER
came O
from O
a O
Marburg B-MISC
and O
Kassel B-MISC
legal O
family O
, O
which O
was O
ennobled O
by O
Charles B-PER
V I-PER

, O
accepted O
by O
the O
patrician O
society O
of O
Alten B-ORG

Limpurg I-ORG
in O
1566 O
and O
raised O
to O
the O
rank O
of O
imperial O
baron O
about O
100 O
years O
later O
. O

At O

Anna B-PER

This O
second O

led O
to O
many O

who O
had O
played O
a O

In O

his O
" O

Three O
years O

he O
was O

accepted O
again O
by O

Old B-PER

In O
1721 O
Lersner B-PER
took O
over O
the O
post O
of O
a O
younger O
mayor O

But O
besides O
all O

time O

a O

, O
they O
were O
able O
to O
organize O
the O

their O

country O

But O
what O
can O
one O
say O
in O
one O
and O
a O
half O
hours O
? O

Pandey B-PER
, O
who O
himself O
comes O
from O
India B-LOC
, O
also O
seemed O
to O
find O
it O
a O
little O
difficult O
. O

He O
tried O
to O
define O
the O
typicality O
of O
the O
country O
by O
its O
diversity O
: O

In O
the O
country O
, O
where O
three O
times O
as O
many O
people O
live O
as O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
6000 O
languages O
are O
spoken O
and O
" O
countless O
religions O
" O
( O
Pandey B-PER
) O
are O
practiced O
. O

There O
are O
about O
600 O
000 O
villages O
and O
huge O
cities O
- O
the O
conflict O
between O
country O
and O
city O
becomes O
a O
conflict O
of O
cultures O
: O

The O
old O
, O
traditional O
culture O
shapes O
India B-LOC
just O
as O
much O
as O
the O
new O
, O
western O
one O
. O

It O
became O
more O
vivid O
when O
Heidemarie B-PER
Pandey I-PER
read O
from O
the O
modern O
Indian B-MISC
women O
's O
novel O
" O
Anaro B-MISC
" O
by O
Marijul B-PER
Bhagat I-PER
, O
which O
the O
Pandey B-PER
couple O
translated O
together O
from O
Indian B-MISC
into O
German B-MISC
. O

Here O
the O
Indian B-MISC
everyday O
life O
was O
in O
the O
center O
: O

Anaro B-PER
, O
the O
heroine O
of O
the O
novel O
, O
works O
as O
a O
maid O
, O
lives O
in O
the O
slums O
and O
has O
to O
take O
care O
of O
her O
little O
daughter O
, O
about O
whom O
the O
father O
does O
not O
care O
. O

But O
the O
insight O
into O
the O
Indian B-MISC
everyday O
life O
remained O
short O
and O
a O
little O
superficial O
- O
especially O
because O
the O
audience O
probably O
lacked O
background O
information O
. O

So O
the O
evening O
about O
India B-LOC
finally O
became O
a O
reading O
, O
the O
room O
emptied O
and O
India B-LOC
remained O
in O
the O
end O

a O

The O

of O
Ulrich B-PER
Röhr I-PER
is O
full O
of O

. O

Like O
his O
original O
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
, O
the O

computer O

. O

The O

by O
the O

Röhr B-PER
himself O
. O

His O

is O
not O
a O

but O
is O
created O
as O
a O

We O
are O
a O

of O

" O
, O
admits O
chairman O
Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
frankly O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Hanau B-MISC
model O
builders O
attach O
great O
importance O
to O
a O
subtle O
difference O
: O

In O
no O
case O
they O
want O
to O
be O
considered O
to O
pursue O
their O
pastime O
with O
doggedness O
. O

That O
would O
hardly O
be O
the O
right O
word O
to O
characterize O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
hobbyists O
and O
tinkerers O
. O

When O
the O
men O
( O
whose O
domain O
is O
still O

) O
enthusiastically O
talk O
about O
technical O
details O
, O

follow O
the O
tracks O
of O
a O
model O
airplane O
with O
the O
remote O

in O
their O
hands O
, O
it O
has O
something O
rather O
quirky O
in O
an O
endearing O
way O
. O

Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
describes O
the O
Hanau B-MISC
model O
builders O
as O
" O
individualists O
who O
have O
come O
together O
through O
a O
common O
love O

In O

with O
the O
claim O
to O

, O
they O
are O
individually O
supervised O
by O

in O
the O
form O
of O
" O
small O
sponsorships O
" O
for O

. O

Two O
" O
factions O
" O
have O
emerged O
in O
the O
model O
club O
, O
which O
has O
existed O
since O
1954 O
: O

the O
pilots O
and O
the O
skippers O
. O

Cars O
, O
on O
the O

hand O

be O
less O

childhood O

this O

Joseph B-PER

Horst B-PER

And O
that O
also O
exists O
: O

a O
" O
real O
" O
flight O
captain O
, O
who O
wants O
to O
relax O
while O

. O

On O
the O

he O
should O
find O
pretty O
much O
everything O
that O
he O
knows O
from O
the O
big O
machines O
as O
important O
functions O
: O

Elevator O
, O
rudder O
, O
ailerons O
, O
landing O

or O
landing O
gear O
for O
example O
. O

With O
their O
fuel O
, O
however O
, O
a O
manned O
aircraft O
could O
not O
take O
off O
. O

Very O
small O
models O
fly O

methanol O
and O
rhizinus O

, O
larger O

with O
an O
unleaded O

. O

Unlike O
ships O
, O
model O
aircraft O

not O
exactly O
replicated O

. O
" O

When O

down O
, O
they O
would O
otherwise O
have O
too O
poor O
flight O
characteristics O
" O
, O
explains O
Pongratz B-PER
. O

Flying O
is O
a O
chapter O
in O
itself O
anyway O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
not O
without O
risk O
and O
requires O
a O
considerable O
sense O
of O
responsibility O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
" O
tinkering O
well O
and O
flying O
well O
" O
are O
two O
different O
things O
, O
says O
Pongratz B-PER

Before O
it O
is O
allowed O
to O
take O
off O
for O
the O
first O

each O
model O

must O
first O
be O
" O
inspected O
" O
, O
as O
Horst B-PER

It O

in O

" O
for O
everything O
that O

Not O
only O
that O
" O
at O

1000 O

were O
broken O

With O

and O
a O

of O
50 O
to O
60 O
kilometers O
per O
hour O
, O
a O
model O
airplane O
with O
its O
mass O
could O
smash O
through O
a O
car O
door O
" O
, O
Schmidt B-PER
illustrates O
. O

That O
's O
why O
at O
least O
two O
adults O
supervise O
the O
young O
people O
when O
they O
practice O
flying O
on O
the O
club O

not O
far O
from O

They O
also O
make O

that O
the O

whose O
radius O
is O
about O
three O
to O
four O
kilometers O
, O
are O
always O
within O

To O
minimize O
the O

the O

If O

then O
in O
completely O
Frankfurt B-LOC
the O
smoking O

react O
to O
a O
request O
of O
the O
local O
advisory O

Shortly O
after O
the O

( O
Dornbusch B-LOC

also O
decided O
to O
do O
so O
. O

According O
to O
the O
Magistrate O

the O
offices O
involved O
are O
currently O
examining O
how O
a O
decision O
already O
taken O
in O
1989 O
by O
the O
Council O
of O
the O
European B-ORG

can O

to O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC
urban O

The O
ban O
on O
smoking O
in O
public O
waiting O

should O
be O
, O
so O
it O
was O
said O
from O
the O
city B-LOC
hall I-LOC
, O
only O
a O
first O
step O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
stop O
smoking O
wherever O
children O
are O
present O
. O

If O
possible O
also O
not O
at O
home O
, O
because O
more O
than O
half O
of O
the O
German B-MISC
children O
lived O
in O
smoker O
households O
. O

How O
dangerous O
passive O
smoking O
is O
especially O
for O
children O
, O
according O
to O
the O
health O
department O
, O
numerous O
studies O
prove O
: O

Even O
before O
delivery O
, O
the O
birth O
weight O
is O
reduced O
; O
another O
consequence O
is O
premature O
births O
, O
miscarriages O
and O
stillbirths O
. O

Respiratory O
diseases O
occur O
in O
children O
of O

in O
the O
first O
two O
years O
of O
life O
about O
twice O
as O
often O
as O
in O

According O
to O
estimates O
by O
the O
Federal B-ORG

in O

up O
to O
1,200 O
people O
in O

caused O
by O

Josef B-PER
Hartinger I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
is O
convinced O
that O
the O
people O
in O
the O
west O
of O
Frankfurt B-MISC
would O
accept O
a O
smoking O
ban O
in O
waiting O
rooms O
. O
" O

The O
problem O
consciousness O
is O
there O
" O
, O
says O
the O
deputy O
local O
chief O
and O
passionate O
smoker O
: O

" O
In O
the O
main O
station B-LOC
, O
I O
have O
already O
been O
politely O
admonished O
when O
I O
forgot O
to O
put O
out O
my O
pipe O
. O
" O

Fortunately O
the O
smoking O
among O
young O
people O
and O
pupils O
decreases O
clearly O
. O

According O
to O
Hartinger O
, O
the O
CDU B-MISC
faction I-MISC
also O
wants O
to O
support O
a O
motion O
, O
which O
the O
SPD B-ORG
will O
bring O
to O
the O
local O
council O
meeting O
next O
Tuesday O
. O

Afterwards O
it O
is O
to O
be O
forbidden O
to O
advertise O
tobacco O
products O
on O

in O
the O
western O
parts O
of O
the O

( O

The O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
made O
an O
important O
contribution O
to O
the O
consideration O
of O
the O
interests O
of O
people O
and O
the O
environment O
by O
developing O
principles O
for O
the O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
displaced O
persons O
or O
otherwise O
affected O
persons O
and O
the O
environmental O
compatibility O
of O
such O
projects O
for O
projects O
financed B-MISC
by O
the O
World O
Bank O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
Government O
of B-LOC
India I-LOC
has O
developed O
a O
comprehensive O
system O
for O
reducing O
environmental O
damage O
from O
public O
projects O
. O

Despite O
all O
these O
positive O
factors O
, O
however O
, O
we O
fear O
that O
the O
situation O
is O
very O
serious O
. O

We O
have O
found O
serious O
flaws O
in O
the O
implementation O
of O
the O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC
. O

We O
think O
that O
the O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC
projects I-MISC
as O
they O
are O
being O
planned O
and O
implemented O
at O
the O
moment O
are O
flawed O
, O
that O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
all O
those O
who O
will O
be O
forcibly O
resettled O
by O
the O
project O
is O
not O
possible O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
and O
that O
the O
environmental O
impact O
of O
the O
project O
is O
not O
being O
carefully O
considered O
or O
adequately O
addressed O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
is O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
situation O
that O
has O
resulted O
as O
the O
debtor O
. O

The O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
intended O
to O
bring O
drinking O

Kutchch B-LOC

other O

state O
as O
well O
as O
two O
districts O

This O
will O
require O
a O
large O

currently O

on O
the O
Narmada B-LOC

a O
full O
reservoir O
height O
of O
455 O
feet O
( O
about O
151 O

It O
will O
submerge O
37,000 O

in O
the O
three O

The O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-LOC
Dam I-LOC
, O
along O
with O

is O
designed O
to O

9.5 O

acre O
feet O

water O
from O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
River O
into O
a O
canal O

The O
canal O
itself O
is O
the O
largest O
in O
the O
world O
in O
terms O
of O
capacity O
and O
will O
extend O
450 O
kilometers O
to O
the O

The O
main O

initially O
250 O
meters O
wide O
, O
towards O
the O
end O
, O
at O
the O
border O

Rajasthan B-LOC

the O
width O
is O
still O
100 O

. O

The O
distribution O
network O
has O
a O
total O
length O
of O
75 O
000 O
kilometers O

In O
total O
, O
about O
80 O

hectares O
of O

are O
needed O
for O
this O
, O
more O
than O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
the O

The O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC

represent O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
water O

projects O
ever O
undertaken O
; O
their O
impact O
covers O
a O
vast O
area O

number O
of O

At O

100,000 O
people O
in O
245 O

live O
in O
the O

In O
Gujarat B-LOC

almost O
all O

In O

thousands O

live O
in O
the O

many O
of O
whom O
also O
have O
no O

In O

there O
are O

In O

to O
the O
100,000 O

living O
in O
the O

there O
are O
probably O
about O
140,000 O

by O
the O

there O
are O
several O

living O
downstream O

The O
idea O
of O
damming O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
goes O
back O
many O
years O
, O
but O
realization O
has O
been O
complicated O

the O

be O
noted O
that O
the O

found O
it O

The O

We O

no O

how O
controversial O
it O
was O
. O

The O
World B-ORG

determination O
to O
do O
this O
is O
a O
testament O
to O
its O
determination O
to O
want O
to O

what O
went O

with O
the O

we O

In O
1979 O
, O
the O
Narmada B-MISC

Arbitration I-MISC
Tribunal I-MISC
in O
India B-LOC
itself O
determined O
that O
displaced O

should O
receive O

2 O

In O

, O
the O

that O

i.e. O

those O
18 O

Landless O
displaced O

should O
receive O
only O
one O

according O
to O
this O
ruling O
. O

India B-LOC
and O
the O
three O
states O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
take O
the O
position O
that O
according O
to O
the O
arbitral O
tribunal O
's O
ruling O
, O
land O
for O
land O
should O
apply O
only O
to O
those O
landowners O
who O
also O
have O
a O
formal O

that O

( O

In O
their O
opinion O
, O
it O
was O
not O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
arbitration O
court O
that O
tribal O
people O
who O
cultivate O
land O
in O
the O
forest O
for O
which O
they O
do O
not O
have O
a O
land O
title O
should O
be O
given O
land O
for O
resettlement O
. O

In O
1980 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
first O
adopted O
general O
resettlement O
principles O
. O

It O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
not O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
resettlement O
but O
also O
of O
rehabilitation O
. O

Therefore O
it O
demands O
that O
in O
the O
case O
of O
resettlement O
, O
displaced O
persons O
must O
at O
least O
regain O
their O
previous O
standard O
of O
living O
. O

This O
group O
of O
persons O
should O
also O
include O
those O
displaced O
by O
dams O
and O
canals O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
developed O
principles O
in O
1982 O
that O
specifically O
addressed O
tribal O
people O
. O

It O
ensured O
that O
the O
traditional O
use O
of O
land O
must O
be O
respected O
and O
required O
that O
they O
be O
forcibly O
resettled O
only O
if O
the O
debtor O
is O
able O
to O
take O
" O
measures O
that O
effectively O
safeguard O
the O
integrity O
and O
welfare O
of O
the O
tribal O
people O
. O

-DOCSTART- O

The O
debtor O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
the O
tribes O
would O
be O
resettled O
, O
nor O
did O
anyone O
have O
any O
real O
idea O
of O
the O
peoples O
who O
would O
be O
forcibly O
resettled O
, O
nor O
had O
the O
affected O
people O
themselves O
been O
consulted O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
resettlement O
measures O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
states O
as O
well O
as O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
were O
based O
on O
the O
measures O
laid O
down O
in O
the O
arbitration O
award O
of O
1979 O
. O

However O
, O
this O
arbitration O
award O
only O
sought O
to O
settle O
a O
dispute O
between O
states O
. O

It O
did O
not O
- O
and O
could O
not O
be O
expected O
to O
- O
design O
measures O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
people O
affected O
by O
the O
projects O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

He O
did O
not O
even O
mention O
those O
displaced O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
nor O
did O
he O
deal O
with O
the O
people O
who O
might O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
, O
nor O
did O
he O
take O
into O
account O
the O
cultural O
characteristics O
of O
the O
forcibly O
resettled O
; O
in O
the O
award O
there O
is O
no O
discussion O
of O
tribalism O
, O
or O
land O
ownership O
without O
land O
title O
, O
or O
the O
true O
meaning O
of O
' O
landlessness O
' O
. O

In O
1985 O
, O
when O
the O
loan O
agreements O
were O
signed O
, O
no O
basis O
existed O
for O
the O
design O
, O
implementation O
and O
compensation O
for O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
. O

The O
number O
of O
people O
who O
would O
be O
affected O
was O
not O
known O
; O
the O
extent O
of O
likely O
impacts O
had O
never O
been O
considered O
; O
the O
canal O
had O
been O
overlooked O
. O

Moreover O
, O
there O
had O
been O
no O
consultation O
with O
those O
threatened O
by O
the O
projects O
. O

Nor O
were O
there O
benchmarks O
to O
verify O
success O
or O
failure O
. O

So O
there O
was O
no O
adequate O
resettlement O
plan O
either O
, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
human O
costs O
could O
not O
be O
included O
as O
a O
factor O
in O
the O
overall O
calculation O
. O

Measures O
to O
reduce O
such O
costs O
could O
not O
be O
designed O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
needs O
of O
those O
affected O
. O

When O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
signed O
the O
contracts O
for O
the O
Sardar B-LOC
Sarovar I-LOC
Dam I-LOC
, O
it O
adopted O
the O
Arbitral O
Tribunal O
's O
definition O
of O
land O
- O
owning O
IDPs O
, O
i.e. O
, O
those O
that O
did O
not O
include O
peasants O
without O
land O
titles O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
did O
not O
deal O
with O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
adult O
sons O
should O
receive O
land O
. O

This O
allowed O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
displaced O
tribesmen O
to O
be O
deprived O
of O
their O
property O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
made O
no O
separate O
provision O
in O
the O
agreement O
for O
the O
canal O
for O
those O
who O
would O
be O
displaced O
or O
otherwise O
affected O
by O
the O
canal O
. O

Only O
those O
affected O
by O
flooding O
or O
project O
infrastructure O
were O
defined O
as O
displaced O
, O
although O
in O
1980 O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
had O
already O
conceded O
that O
resettlement O
would O
be O
necessary O
in O
the O
event O
of O
displacement O
by O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
systems O
. O

In O
1990 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
promulgated O
comprehensive O
resettlement O
principles O
to O
be O
applied O
generally O
to O
involuntary O
resettlement O
, O
and O
in O
1991 O
it O
promulgated O
special O
resettlement O
principles O
for O
tribal O
people O
. O

These O
statements O
reiterated O
and O
further O
differentiated O
the O
principles O
established O
a O
decade O
earlier O
. O

These O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
principles O
reflect O
the O
general O
adoption O
of O
new O
human O
rights O
concepts O
. O

They O
recognize O
that O
large O
- O
scale O
projects O
, O
especially O
in O
rural O
, O
forest O
and O
settlement O
fringe O
areas O
, O
can O
forcibly O
displace O
people O
as O
much O
as O
war O
or O
natural O
disasters O
. O

They O
focus O
on O
people O
displaced O
by O
development O
advances O
and O
demand O
that O
any O
project O
respect O
the O
human O
rights O
of O
displaced O
people O
. O

According O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
, O
these O
are O
rights O
that O
can O
not O
be O
overridden O
by O
national O
sovereignty O
or O
national O
interests O
. O

Such O
considerations O
may O
justify O
a O
project O
, O
but O
under O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
they O
do O
not O
justify O
the O
nullification O
of O
these O
human O
rights O
by O
a O
project O
. O

The O
governments O
of O
the O
three O
countries O
declare O
their O
willingness O
to O
implement O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
arbitral O

and O
to O
proceed O
according O
to O
the O
credit O
guidelines O
of O
the O
World B-ORG

However O
, O
there O
is O
disagreement O
on O
the O
interpretation O
. O

Gujarat B-LOC
, O
with O
4700 O
displaced O
families O
, O
adopted O
a O
policy O
in O
1988 O
of O
offering O
2 O
acres O
of O
land O
to O
each O
land O
- O
owning O
displaced O
person O
with O
land O
title O
. O

It O
also O
offers O
2 O
hectares O
to O
those O
classified O
as O
" O
landless O
" O
; O
tribals O
and O
others O
who O
may O
work O
land O
without O
land O

are O
thus O
offered O
2 O
hectares O
of O
land O
. O

According O
to O
Gujarat B-LOC
's I-LOC
policy O
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
arbitration O
court O

ruling O
, O
adult O

also O
receive O
two O
hectares O
. O

The O
Gujarat B-LOC
government O
and O
the O
governments O
of O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
agree O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
's I-LOC
policy O
goes O
beyond O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
arbitral O
tribunal O
and O
the O
World B-MISC
Bank I-MISC
guidelines I-MISC
. O

Maharashtra B-LOC
, O
where O
about O
3,000 O
families O
need O
to O

, O
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
, O
with O
23,000 O

to O

are O
willing O
to O
give O
two O
acres O
of O
land O

. O

But O
they O
are O
not O
willing O
to O
give O
two O
acres O
for O
adult O
sons O
. O

Neither O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
nor O
Maharashtra B-LOC
recognizes O
any O
rights O
for O
land O
compensation O
to O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
. O

These O
differences O
in O
the O
policies O
of O
the O
states O
had O
resulted O
in O
a O
dispute O
over O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O

and O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
World B-ORG

The O
dispute O
may O
seem O
technical O

on O
its O
outcome O

the O

How O
can O
this O
be O
ensured O
in O
the O
case O
of O
displaced O
persons O
who O
know O
only O
agriculture O
as O
an O

for O

it O
represents O
the O

, O
if O

by O
providing O

In O
1984 O
, O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
Control O
Authority O
, O
which O
had O
been O
set O
up O
to O
supervise O
the O

stated O
: O

" O
For O

, O
there O
is O
no O
more O
effective O

" O

We O
have O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
the O
only O
way O
to O
ensure O
that O
their O
standard O
of O
living O
improves O
or O
at O
least O
remains O
the O
same O
. O

The O
result O
of O
calling O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
landless O
means O
that O
people O
who O
work O
land O
they O
consider O
their O
own O
become O
landless O
laborers O
. O

This O
is O
not O
rehabilitation O
. O

It O
does O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
live O
at O

as O
well O
as O
before O
. O

Tribals O
in O
Madhya B-LOC

Maharashtra B-LOC
are O
very O
aware O
of O
this O
and O
what O
it O
means O
to O
them O
when O
they O
are O
resettled O
as O
landless O
laborers O
. O

When O
we O
visited O
Bamni B-LOC
, O
a O
tribal O
village O
in O
Maharashtra B-LOC
, O
the O
people O
told O
us O
: O

" O
We O
are O
farmers O
, O
not O
laborers O
. O
" O

In O
our O
view O
, O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
have O
failed O
to O
meet O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
loan O
conditions O
, O
as O
they O
have O
failed O
to O
provide O
adequate O
land O
for O

of O

The O
states O
argue O
that O
under O
the O
arbitration O

and O
agreements O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
all O
displaced O
people O
have O
the O
right O
to O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
where O
both O
landowning O
and O
landless O
displaced O
people O
are O
to O
receive O
two O
acres O
of O

. O

Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
therefore O
expect O
many O
IDPs O
to O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
. O

Accordingly O
, O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
's O
resettlement O
plan O
actually O
includes O
only O
10 O
% O
of O
the O
land O
needed O
for O

. O

But O
many O
displaced O
people O
do O
not O
want O
to O
move O
to O
Gujarat B-LOC
for O
reasons O
related O
to O

For O

right O
to O
be O
resettled O
in O
their O
own O
state O
. O

While O
it O
is O
true O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
been O
quite O
successful O
in O
carrying O
out O
resettlement O
in O
the O
last O
eighteen O
months O
, O
so O
far O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
resettled O
only O
about O
3000 O
families O
. O

Resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
so O
many O
more O
displaced O
persons O
- O
perhaps O
15,000 O
families O
- O
from O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
would O
be O
an O
enormous O
task O
for O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
would O
place O
a O
considerable O
strain O
on O
its O
limited O
resources O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
is O
not O
just O
about O
resettlement O
, O
it O
is O
also O
about O
rehabilitating O
people O
. O

The O
states O
may O
be O
able O
to O
organize O
the O
physical O
relocation O
of O
thousands O
of O
families O
to O
land O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
will O
be O
able O
to O
rehabilitate O
them O
all O
. O

The O
only O
resettlement O
policy O
that O
all O
three O

have O
to O
apply O
is O
that O
of O
the O
World B-ORG

But O
this O
policy O
of O
the O
World B-ORG

has O
not O
been O
followed O
. O

Projects O
have O
not O
been O
developed O
in O

with O

Basic O
information O
was O
not O
obtained O

adequate O

were O
not O
designed O
. O

Apart O
from O
Gujarat B-LOC
's I-LOC
successes O
in O
providing O
land O
for O
flooded O
people O
, O
the O
projects O
were O
not O
developed O

Apart O
from O
Gujarat O

in O
providing O

for O
flood O
- O
displaced O
people O
, O
no O
land O
has O
been O
provided O
for O
those O
already O
displaced O
in O
1960 O
- O
61 O
, O
when O
six O
villages O
in O
Kevadia B-LOC
were O
expropriated O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
dam O
site O
. O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
some O
villagers O
were O
paid O
compensation O
in O
cash O
. O

But O
since O
1985 O
these O
people O
are O
also O
covered O
by O
the O
contracts O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
. O

Their O
entitlement O
to O
land O
should O
have O
been O
recognized O
seven O
years O
ago O
, O
but O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
failed O
to O
ensure O
recognition O
of O
these O
claims O
by O
Gujarat B-LOC
as O
part O
of O
the O
contracts O
, O
let O
alone O
the O
provision O
of O
adequate O
land O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
only O
recently O
urged O
India B-LOC
- O
though O
without O
insisting O
- O
that O
India B-LOC
and O
the O
states O
comply O
with O
the O
1979 O
arbitration O
award O
regarding O
adult O

; O
India B-LOC
should O
establish O
principles O
to O
meet O
the O
broad O
objective O
of O
the O
World B-MISC
Bank I-MISC
guidelines I-MISC
and O
ensure O
land O
for O
people O
without O
land O
titles O

However O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
not O
only O
failed O
to O
have O
the O
arbitration O
award O
and O
treaties O
put O
into O
effect O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
canal O
, O
it O
has O
failed O
in O
that O
it O
has O
not O
established O
a O
binding O
provision O
in O
its O
contract O
with O
Gujarat B-LOC
that O
calls O
for O
the O
implementation O
of O
World B-MISC

regulations I-MISC

What O
about O
the O
villagers O
who O
live O
in O
the O
area O
of O
the O
canal O
? O

The O
construction O
of O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
will O
affect O
140,000 O
families O
, O
of O
which O
perhaps O
13,000 O
- O
no O
one O
knows O
how O
many O
- O
will O
lose O
a O
large O
part O
or O
all O
of O
their O
land O
. O

The O
people O
who O
will O
lose O
land O
to O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
will O
be O
offered O
compensation O
under O
the O
Land O
Acquisition O
Act O
of O
1894 O
. O

The O
number O
of O
people O
affected O
is O
disputed O
in O
the O
estimates O
. O

But O
this O
much O
is O
clear O
: O

Acquisition O
of O
land O
under O
the O
Land O
Acquisition O
Act O
has O
often O
meant O
that O
farmers O
who O
lost O
land O
were O
compensated O
with O
amounts O
far O
below O
the O
real O
cost O
of O
reacquisition O
. O

For O
us O
, O
the O
responsibility O
on O
this O
point O
lies O
squarely O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
. O

It O
did O
not O
include O
resettlement O
costs O
for O
canal O
displaced O
people O
in O
the O
1985 O
loan O
agreements O
, O
although O
this O
had O
been O
part O
of O
World B-MISC
Bank I-MISC
policy I-MISC
for O
five O
years O
. O

Growing O
respect O
for O
human O
rights O
has O
given O
rise O
to O
new O
forms O
of O
resettlement O
and O

. O

The O
World B-ORG

guidelines O
have O
had O
a O
major O
influence O
in O
establishing O
these O

The O
history O
of O
Sardar B-LOC
- I-LOC
Sarovar I-LOC
's O
environmental O
impact O
is O
a O
history O
of O
permits O
not O
being O
granted O
. O

There O
is O
no O
comprehensive O
document O
on O
the O
impacts O
. O

The O
nature O
and O
extent O
of O
environmental O
problems O
and O
solutions O
are O
unknown O
. O

This O
contributes O
significantly O
to O
the O
controversy O
that O
surrounds O
the O
project O
. O

As O
with O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
, O
this O
fact O
has O
placed O
our O
investigation O
in O
a O
difficult O
position O
. O

To O
complete O
our O
work O
, O
we O
had O
to O
gather O
basic O
ecological O
information O
to O
be O
able O
to O
describe O
the O
probable O
effects O
of O
the O
project O
upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
catchment O
area O
of O
the O
project O
. O

This O
work O
should O
have O
been O
done O
by O
others O
before O
the O
projects O
were O
approved O
. O

( O
.. O

. O

) O

We O
found O
inconsistencies O
in O
the O
basic O
hydrological O
information O
related O
to O
these O
works O
( O
i.e. O
at O
dam O
and O
canal O
, O
t.e O
. O
) O
. O
Therefore O
, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
water O
flow O
data O
and O
made O
our O
own O
analysis O
. O

We O
concluded O
that O
there O
is O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
projects O
will O
not O
work O
as O
planned O
. O

The O
problems O
relate O
to O
the O
frequency O
and O
timing O
of O
steady O
- O
state O
flows O
and O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O
dam O
and O
canal O
to O
store O
and O
distribute O
water O
. O

The O
impacts O
of O
Sardar B-LOC
Sarovar I-LOC
, O
upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
basin O
will O
therefore O
be O
different O
than O
as O
currently O
assumed O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
built O
upstream O
as O
planned O
. O

A O
realistic O
operational O
analysis O
on O
which O
to O
base O
an O
environmental O
impact O
assessment O
is O
lacking O
. O

This O
has O
alarmed O
us O
and O
it O
should O
alarm O
others O
, O
especially O
for O
a O
mega O
project O
with O
such O
far O
reaching O
implications O
as O
Sardar B-LOC
Sarovar I-LOC
. O

( O
.. O

. O

) O

The O
shortcomings O
we O
found O
in O
environmental O
mitigation O
also O
extend O
to O
the O
project O
's O
catchment O
area O
. O

Although O
comprehensive O
studies O
are O
lacking O
, O
we O
found O
that O
there O
will O
most O
likely O
be O
problems O
with O
siltation O
and O
salinization O
. O

Projections O
on O
which O
the O
plans O
for O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
and O
protection O
measures O
are O
based O
are O
questionable O
. O

We O
can O
only O
conclude O
that O
future O
problems O
in O
the O
basin O
as O
a O
whole O
will O
be O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
found O
by O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
in O
many O
other O
irrigation O
projects O
in O
the O
1991 O

Large O
irrigation O
projects O
such O
as O
the O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
known O
to O
pose O
health O
risks O
. O

Beginning O
with O
the O
initial O
design O
phase O
and O
continuing O
through O
the O
construction O
of O
canals O
and O
ponds O
to O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
reservoir O
, O
there O
is O
an O
inevitable O
risk O
that O
waterborne O
diseases O
will O
increase O
rapidly O
. O

These O
have O
been O
documented O
since O
1930 O
, O
and O
projects O
supported O
by O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
have O
experienced O
some O
of O
the O
problems O
that O
can O
occur O
. O

But O
as O
recently O
as O
January O
1992 O
, O
we O
find O
statements O
by O
the O
World B-MISC
Bank I-MISC
consultant I-MISC
that O
the O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC
projects I-MISC
gave O
the O
impression O
that O
they O
were O
" O
planned O
, O
designed O
and O
implemented O
without O
the O
inclusion O
of O
health O
care O
. O
" O

He O
described O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
project O
as O
" O
death O
traps O
" O
and O
as O
" O
transporting O
malaria O
to O
the O
doorsteps O
of O
villagers O
" O
and O
providing O
" O
ideal O
breeding O

for O
malaria O
mosquitoes O

He O
reported O
a O
total O
breakdown O
of O
measures O
to O
control O
bacterial O
transmission O

The O
incidence O
of O
malaria O
has O
risen O
steeply O
in O
villages O
near O
the O
dam O
; O
local O
hospitals O
reported O
malaria O
deaths O
. O

The O
failure O
to O
anticipate O
and O
prevent O
malaria O
occurrences O
is O
part O
of O
the O
failure O
to O
implement O
measures O
to O
remedy O

effects O
of O

Despite O

on O

the O
Sardar B-MISC

continue O

in O
the O
words O
of O
Prime O
Minister O
Patel B-PER
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
as O
" O
a O
matter O
of O
trust O
. O
" O

It O
is O
evident O
that O
technical O
and O
economic O
requirements O
of O
the O
projects O
have O
led O
to O
the O
exclusion O
of O
human O
and O
environmental O
concerns O
. O

Social O
and O
environmental O
concessions O
were O
made O
that O
today O
seem O
unacceptable O
. O

The O
World B-ORG

pursued O
a O
strategy O
that O
it O
characterized O
as O
" O
gradual O
" O
in O
an O
attempt O
not O
to O
violate O
its O
own O
resettlement O
regulations O
. O

India B-LOC
has O
done O
something O
similar O
by O
adopting O
the O
principle O
of O
pari O
passu O
for O
environmental O
issues O
. O

However O
, O
these O
types O
of O
approaches O
have O
not O
achieved O
the O
goals O
set O
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
make O
it O
clear O
that O
these O
important O
areas O
- O
resettlement O
and O
environment O
- O
are O
treated O
only O
as O
secondary O
. O

( O

) O

Any O
decision O
on O
the O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC

has O
always O
been O
and O
will O
always O
be O
a O
decision O
of O
India B-LOC

the O
countries O
involved O
. O

Together O
they O
have O
spent O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
money O
. O

The O
foundation O
stones O
for O
the O
dam O
have O
been O
laid O
, O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
dam O
is O
growing O

the O
turbines O
have O
been O
ordered O
and O
the O
canal O
has O
been O
completed O
up O
to O
the O
Mahi O
River O
. O

Nobody O
wants O
this O
money O
to O
be O
wasted O
. O

But O
we O
warn O
that O
it O
may O
be O
far O
more O
wasteful O
to O
continue O
now O
without O
knowing O
exactly O
the O
cost O
to O
people O
and O
the O
environment O
. O

We O
have O
concluded O
that O
it O
would O
be O
irresponsible O
for O
us O
to O
put O
together O
a O
set O
of O
recommendations O
for O
implementation O
in O
light O
of O
the O
flaws O
that O
are O
so O
obvious O
to O
us O
in O
the O
project O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
wisest O
decision O
for O
the O
World B-ORG

would O
be O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O

reconsider O
them O

It O
all O
started O
when O

recognized O
his O
ecological O
" O

" O
: O

When O

he O
had O
installed O
an O
electric O

" O

" O
, O
he O
realized O
only O
afterwards O
, O
" O
is O
much O
too O
precious O
to O
heat O
with O
it O
. O
" O

So O
in O
1982 O
he O
replaced O
the O
underfloor O
heating O
with O
four O
tiled O
stoves O
, O
which O
are O
" O
fed O
" O
with O
dry O

. O
" O

Not O
as O
comfortable O
" O
, O
he O
admits O
, O
" O
but O
more O
ecologically O
valuable O
. O
" O

About O
three O
years O
later O
, O
the O
Kirchhofs B-PER
installed O
solar O
collectors O
, O
which O
are O
used O
to O
heat O

Such O
solar O
systems O
for O

are O
relatively O

" O
With O

calculates O
, O
" O
can O
be O
financed O
a O

system O
with O
half O
a O
kilowatt O
, O
which O
saves O
about O
0.5 O

, O
also O

expired O

apply O
for O

In O
addition O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER
received O
another O
1000 O
marks O
per O

of O

from O
EAM B-ORG
. O

After O
deducting O
all O
the O
subsidies O
, O
he O
had O
to O
raise O
about O
33,000 O
marks O
out O
of O

Kirchhof B-PER
is O
naturally O
pleased O

the O
German B-MISC
subsidy O
program O
- O
and O
not O
only O
because O
it O
has O
brought O
him O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
is O
not O

it O
: O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O

have O
become O
cheaper O

2,500 O
German B-MISC
builders O
as O
a O
result O

the O

that O
some O

however O
, O
the O

not O

the O

not O

For O
this O
reason O
Kirchhof B-PER
considers O
the O
subsidy O
guidelines O
to O
be O
in O
need O
of O
improvement O
. O

For O

, O
because O
the O
American B-MISC

said O
the O

is O

regularly O
up O

down O
the O

Jochen B-PER
Vesper I-PER
can O
always O
observe O
that O
the O

teach O
the O
little O

There O
are O
rarely O
conflicts O
among O
the O

Even O
if O
the O

sometimes O
seems O
martial O
to O

For O

the O

That O
the O

in O
poor O
condition O

had O
already O

At O
that O
time O
the O
upper O

was O
still O
inhabited O
, O
in O
the O

was O
a O
kiosk O
, O
whose O
owner O
had O
to O
give O
up O
despite O
strong O
protests O
in O
the O
district O
. O

But O
only O
after O
a O
sum O
of O
5.9 O
million O
marks O
for O
the O
entire O
project O
including O
Kapellle O
was O
decided O
, O
one O
took O
the O
old O
house O
again O
under O
the O
magnifying O
glass O
. O

It O
proved O
to O
be O
dilapidated O
, O
although O
it O
had O
looked O
" O
tidy O
" O
at O
first O
, O
at O
least O
from O
the O
outside O
, O
as O
Schmitteckert O
assured O
. O

The O
ceiling O
had O
to O
be O
shored O
up O
because O
of O
the O
danger O
of O
collapse O
. O

If O
the O
application O
for O
additional O
costs O
is O
approved O
, O
the O
project O
manager O
estimates O
that O
it O
will O
take O
another O
year O
before O
the O
new O
building O
can O
be O
occupied O
. O

The O
renovation O
of O
the O
three O
buildings O
, O
which O
has O
now O
cost O
7.3 O
million O
marks O
, O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
completed O
in O
the O
course O
of O
next O
year O
. O

The O
new O
building O
at O
Marktstrasse B-LOC
58 O
will O
then O
have O
considerable O
advantages O
over O
the O
old O
building O
. O

This O
could O
have O
been O
insulated O
only O
inadequately O
against O
sound O
. O

The O
new O
building O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
will O
have O
higher O
ceilings O
of O
reinforced O
concrete O
and O
modern O

, O
which O
will O
dampen O

The O
reason O
: O

Some O
of O

which O
the O

had O
placed O
on O
the O

agree O
to O

Whether O

to O
decide O

Should O
this O

of O

, O
the O
supervisory O
board O
of O
Nassauische B-ORG

can O

approval O

The O
cooperative O
can O
more O
easily O
fulfill O
the O
other O
conditions O
set O
by O
the O
Minister O
of O
Housing O
: O

It O
must O
sign O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Agreement I-MISC
. O

It O
stipulates O
that O
all O
vacant O
apartments O
must O
be O
reported O
to O
the O
housing B-ORG
authority I-ORG
and O
can O
be O
occupied O
by O
the O
authority O
with O
new O
tenants O
. O

This O
condition O
is O
easy O
to O
fulfill O
, O
said O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
, O
a O
member O
of O
the O
cooperative O
's O
board O
. O

Another O
condition O
of O
the O
Minister O
is O
to O
raise O
the O
rent O
bit O
by O
bit O
up O
to O
a O
price O
per O
square O
meter O
of O
8.50 O
marks O
. O

This O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
cooperative O
can O
operate O
profitably O
and O
that O
the O
country O
does O
not O
have O
to O
answer O
for O
the O
accumulated O
debts O
in O
the O
event O
of O
bankruptcy O
. O

At O
present O
the O
cooperative O
is O
missing O
according O
to O
information O
of O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
also O
still O
another O
so O
- O
called O
maintenance O
appraisal O
: O

It O
is O
to O
clarify O
in O
principle O
whether O
a O
small O
cooperative O
can O
lead O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
of O
only O
1072 O
dwellings O
at O
all O
profitably O
. O

If O
all O
conditions O
are O
fulfilled O
, O
the O
Heimatsiedlung O
can O
change O
hands O
for O
the O
purchase O
price O
of O
about O
80 O
million O
marks O
. O

The O
sum O
is O
composed O
as O
follows O
: O

48.3 O
million O
marks O
the O
country O
gives O
the O
cooperative O
as O
an O
interest O
- O
free O
subsidy O
. O

for O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
Heimat O
- O

. O

The O
money O
is O
thus O
simply O

The O
missing O

of O
about O
32 O

is O

covered O
by O

, O
which O
would O
also O
have O
to O
be O
taken O
over O
by O
the O

. O

The O
aforementioned O
rent O

will O

to O

off O
the O

and O
, O
if O
necessary O

as O
Hannelore B-PER

explained O

" O

There O

in O

, O
Schneider B-PER
continued O

Sufficient O
control O
instances O
are O
built O
in O
, O
she O
assured O
, O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O

would O
again O

exposed O
to O
the O
uncertainties O
that O
arose O
after O
the O

of O
the O

owner O
Neue O

However O
, O
not O
all O

seem O
convinced O
of O
this O
. O

They O
are O
satisfied O
with O
the O
management O
of O
the O
Heimatsiedlung O
by O
Nassauische B-ORG
Heimstätte I-ORG
and O
see O
the O
vote O
and O
the O
discussion O
about O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
as O
bringing O
unnecessary O
unrest O
into O
the O
Sachsenhausen B-MISC
residential O
district O
. O

To O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
many O
tenants O
contributes O
besides O
that O
the O
maintenance O
condition O
of O
the O
dwellings O
is O
not O
good O
. O

Only O
recently O
the O
gas O
pipes O
in O
the O

had O
to O
be O
taken O
from O
the O
net O
, O
since O
the O
money O
for O
a O
reorganization O
was O
missing O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
cooperative O
are O
nevertheless O
optimistic O
: O

" O
We O
will O
work O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
required O

Will O

this O

it O
is O

question O
at O

reverse O

trend O
which O

begun O
after O

which O
let O

foreign O

Alsatian B-MISC

High B-MISC
German I-MISC
as O
its O
written O
form O
of O
expression O
were O
not O
suppressed O

even O
forbidden O

But O
the O
general O
conditions O
ensured O
that O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC

the O
German B-MISC
were O
pushed O
back O
more O
and O
more O
. O

Thus O
many O
place O

street O
signs O
were O
Frenchized B-MISC

Soon O
after O
the O

, O
official O
correspondence O
could O
only O
be O
conducted O
in O

In O

even O

talk O
in O

the O
conversations O
with O
the O
children O
take O
place O
in O
French B-MISC

The O
consequence O
: O

quickly O
developed O

the O
predominant O
colloquial O
language O
in O
Alsace O
. O

The O
German B-MISC
- O
language O

lost O

no O

often O

do O
not O

which O
is O
usually O
not O

Already O
in O

not O
remain O

, O
including O

and O
the O
response O

enormous O

But O
in O
the O
sense O

real O
" O

" O
, O
associations O
like O
the O
René B-ORG

But O
with O

The O

German O
was O
spoken O
for O
three O
hours O
a O
week O
outside O
of O
the O
usual O
German B-MISC
lessons I-MISC
in O
various O
subjects O
in O
about O
60 O
classes O
in O
30 O
elementary O
schools O
. O

A O
spectacular O
success O
was O
achieved O
by O
the O
ABCM B-MISC
citizens I-MISC
' O
initiative O
, O
which O
has O
already O
been O
joined O
by O
about O
800 O
parents O
and O
teachers O
: O

Supported O
by O
subsidies O
from O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
Regional O
Council O
, O
the O
two O
General O
Councils O
and O
even O
the O
EC B-ORG
, O
also O
with O
practical O
help O
from O
some O
local O
councils O
, O
six O
now O
truly O
bilingual O
preschool O
classes O
have O
been O
set O
up O
, O
in O
which O
13 O
hours O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
13 O
hours O
of O
German B-MISC
are O
spoken O
. O

This O
first O
significant O
progress O
towards O
bilingualism O
demonstrates O
that O
the O
advocates O
of O
bilingualism O
still O
face O
a O
stubborn O
opponent O
, O
and O
that O
opponent O
is O
Paris B-LOC
. O

In O
Alsace B-LOC
, O
it O
is O
present O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
national O
education O
authority O
. O

Since O
1982 O
, O
a O
law O
has O
allowed O
, O
in O
principle O
, O
the O
teaching O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
the O
regional O
language O
on O
an O
equal O
footing O
, O
if O
parents O
so O
wish O
. O

This O
directive O
has O
been O
implemented O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
in O
Brittany B-LOC
, O
but O
not O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

The O
real O
concern O
of O
ABCM B-ORG
is O
the O
establishment O
of O
bilingual O
classes O
within O
the O
official O
state O
school O
system O
. O

The O
municipal O
council O
of O
Mulhouse B-LOC
has O
already O
taken O
a O
decision O
to O
this O
effect O
. O

For O
lack O
of O
a O
hearing O
, O
however O
, O
ABCM B-ORG
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
make O
a O
first O
push O
with O
bilingual O
kindergartens O
on O
a O
private O
basis O
. O

But O
even O
these O
initiatives O
meet O
resistance O
in O
some O
places O
, O
the O
promised O
subsidies O
of O
the O
EC B-ORG
and O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
local O
authorities O
can O
not O
be O
fully O
used O
for O
lack O
of O
opportunity O
: O

Sometimes O
, O
the O
local O
authorities O
do O
not O
make O
rooms O
available O
, O
and O
ABCM B-ORG
suspects O
that O
the O
state O
education O
authority O
sometimes O
exerts O
pressure O
on O
mayors O
. O

In O
the O
most O
spectacular O
case O
of O
dispute O
in O
Pulversheim B-LOC
, O
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
state O
school O
, O
with O
the O
backing O
of O
a O
teachers O
' O
association O
, O
defended O
themselves O
against O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
the O
same O
building O
, O
in O
a O
room O
( O
otherwise O
unused O
! O
) O
, O
a O
bilingual O
school O
was O
established O
. O

) O
a O
bilingual O
ABCM B-MISC
preschool I-MISC
class I-MISC
was O
accommodated O
in O
the O
same O
building O
. O

The O
Mairie O
and O
the O
school O
administration O
met O
already O
in O
court O
. O

The O
matter O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
finally O
settled O
. O

After O
all O
: O

" O
State O
" O
and O
" O
private O
" O
children O
can O
now O
use O
the O
same O
toilet O
and O
also O
play O
together O
during O
breaks O
- O
which O
was O
not O
possible O
at O
the O
beginning O
. O

" O
The O
president O
of O
the O
Haut B-ORG
Comité I-ORG
, O
Goetschy B-PER
, O
complains O
that O
there O
are O
still O
too O
few O
dialect O
programs O
on O
radio O
and O
television O
. O

The O
politician O
is O
concerned O
that O
the O
recent O
reform O
of O
the O
French B-MISC
constitution O
expressly O
states O
that O
French B-MISC
is O
the O
" O
language O
of O
the O
republic O
" O
, O
but O
that O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
regional O
languages O
is O
not O
mentioned O
anywhere O
. O

The O
supporters O
of O
bilingualism O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
are O
probably O
not O
wrong O
in O
their O
assumption O
that O
behind O
disinterest O
and O
stubborn O
resistance O
in O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
lies O
the O
fear O
of O
a O
creeping O
" O
Germanization B-MISC
" O
of O
Alsace B-LOC
, O
of O
a O
" O
drifting O
away O
" O
of O
this O
region O
, O
also O
the O
will O
not O
to O
give O
up O
the O
dominance O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
with O
it O
the O
political O
supremacy O
of O
centralism O
. O

But O
even O
the O
most O
resolute O
supporters O
of O
" O
bilinguisme O
" O
clearly O
define O
themselves O
as O
French B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
as O
Europeans B-MISC
and O
Alsatians B-MISC
who O
want O
to O
preserve O
and O
rebuild O
a O
social O
and O
cultural O
regional O
identity O
through O
bilingualism O
in O
a O
Europe B-LOC
that O
is O
growing O
together O
. O

So O
it O
is O
not O
only O
in O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
that O
resistance O
must O
be O
overcome O
. O

There O
are O
also O
contradictions O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
itself O
. O

Thus O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
Strasbourg B-ORG
city I-ORG
council I-ORG
to O
subtitle O
60 O
streets O
and O
squares O
with O
their O
historical O
German B-MISC
names O
met O
with O
unexpectedly O
fierce O
protest O
in O
the O
European B-MISC
city I-MISC
of O
all O
places O
, O
which O
was O
reflected O
in O
numerous O
letters O
to O
the O
editor O
from O
angry O
Strasbourg B-MISC
citizens O
and O
in O
thoughtful O
comments O
in O
the O
media O
. O

German B-MISC
, O
according O
to O
the O
critics O
, O
was O
not O
only O
the O
language O
of O
the O
Strasbourg B-MISC
student O
Goethe B-PER
, O
but O
also O
the O
language O
of O
Hitler B-PER
. O

It O
became O
obvious O
that O
the O
Nazi B-MISC
period I-MISC
in O
Alsace B-LOC
continues O
as O
a O
trauma O
. O

For O
months O
this O
dispute O
lasted O
until O
finally O
a O
compromise O
was O
found O
: O

The O
signs O
at O
the O
streets O
and O
places O
do O
not O
receive O
German B-MISC
, O
but O
Alsatian B-MISC
additional O
names O
- O
as O
already O
in O
many O
places O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
advocates O
of O
bilingualism O
may O
see O
themselves O
in O
the O
unstoppable O
trend O
of O
the O
times O
. O

The O
practical O
experiences O
and O
requirements O
of O
the O
EC B-MISC
internal I-MISC
market I-MISC
alone O
promote O
the O
tendency O
towards O
" O
bilinguisme O
" O
. O

After O
all O
, O
some O
60,000 O
Alsatians B-MISC
already O
work O
as O
cross O

commuters O
in O

and O
everywhere O
either O

And O

Surprisingly O
, O
the O
national O
school O
administration O
( O

recently O
announced O
to O
open O
two O
bilingual O

A O

: O

the O
idea O
, O
to O
establish O
a O

parliament O
in O
Bad B-LOC
Homburg I-LOC

On O
14 O
June O
last O
year O
, O
the O
young O
people O
came O
together O
to O
take O
up O
suggestions O
from O
young O
people O
in O
their O
parliament O
and O
bring O
them O
into O
" O
big O
" O
politics O
. O

The O
initial O
skepticism O
of O
the O
" O
adult O
" O
politicians O
has O
given O
way O
. O

But O
how O
do O
the O
young O

themselves O
now O
see O
their O

? O

" O
It O
has O
come O
into O

, O
" O
says O
Karl B-PER
Thomas I-PER
Koehnen I-PER
, O
a O
member O
of O
the O
coordination O
committee O
of O
the O
youth O
parliament O
, O
with O
a O
view O
to O
the O
last O
year O
, O
which O
brought O
a O
lot O
of O
experience O
, O
but O
so O
far O
little O
success O
. O

The O
steps O
of O
the O
young O
Bad B-MISC
Homburgers I-MISC
went O
first O
to O
give O
the O
work O
of O
the O
youth O
parliament O
a O
firm O
framework O
, O
the O
young O
people O
a O
possibility O
of O
influence O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
council O
of O
elders O
of O
the O
city O
parliament O
has O
now O
decided O
to O
grant O
young O
people O
the O
right O
to O
speak O
in O
the O
committees O
- O
but O
only O
on O
the O
motions O
they O
put O
forward O
. O

" O
We O
did O
not O
find O
a O
right O
to O
speak O
in O
all O
points O
so O
favorable O
" O
, O
says O
city O
council O
chairwoman O
Maria B-PER
Scholz I-PER
. O

She O
has O
accompanied O
the O
work O
of O
the O
youth O
parliament O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

In O
her O
opinion O
, O
it O
was O
right O
to O
limit O
the O
young O
people O
's O
influence O
, O
but O
to O
" O
hold O
them O
accountable O
" O
on O
the O
points O
they O
raise O
, O
so O
that O
they O
learn O
to O
listen O
and O
ask O
questions O
" O
. O

This O
pedagogical O
approach O
disturbs O
the O
chairwoman O
of O
the O
Green B-MISC
faction I-MISC
in O
the O
city O
parliament O
, O
Renate B-PER
Bill I-PER
. O

She O
fears O
that O
a O
" O
conflict O
potential O
" O
of O
the O
young O
people O
, O
which O
could O
also O
be O
used O
constructively O
, O
is O
" O
steered O
into O
fixed O
channels O
" O
by O
the O
parliamentary O
work O
. O

Many O
things O
can O
be O
better O
achieved O
in O
open O
youth O
work O
. O

Also O
Peter B-PER
Walz I-PER
of O
the O
E B-ORG

fears O
that O
thereby O
" O
energies O
are O
bound O
, O
which O
could O
become O
free O
elsewhere O
" O
. O

For O
him O
, O
a O
youth O
parliament O
does O
not O
exist O
" O
if O
it O
can O
not O
enforce O
anything O
" O
. O

The O
young O
people O
do O
not O
have O
so O
little O
hope O
: O

For O
them O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
parliamentary O
life O
. O
" O

Only O
then O
we O
take O
part O
in O
the O
decisions O
" O
, O
says O
Markus B-PER
Schulz I-PER
, O
who O
also O
sits O
on O
the O
coordination O
committee O
. O

Results O
are O
particularly O
important O
to O
him O
: O

" O
We O
must O
have O
something O
to O
show O
. O

Then O
the O
young O
people O
also O
take O
it O
seriously O
and O
continue O
to O
support O
us O
. O
" O

Because O
one O
thing O
the O
young O
parliamentarians O
have O
recognized O
: O

Without O
support O
among O
their O
peers O
, O
the O
youth O
parliament O
will O
not O
get O
any O
further O
. O
" O

We O
are O
just O
really O
only O
the O
representatives O
. O

We O
can O
only O
pass O
on O
what O
young O
people O
bring O
to O
us O
. O
" O

They O
hold O
this O
view O
so O
vehemently O
also O
because O
they O
do O
not O
want O
" O
such O
a O
mentality O
to O
develop O
: O

" O
We O
have O
our O
functionaries O
now O
and O
they O
'll O
do O
it O
already O
. O
" O

Only O
few O
suggestions O
reach O
the O
youth O
parliament O
so O
far O
. O

Perhaps O
because O
the O
young O
people O
themselves O
first O
had O
to O
penetrate O
the O
depths O
of O
local O
politics O
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
that O
is O
concerned O
, O
now O
even O
their O
once O
biggest O
critic O
, O
FDP B-MISC

takes O
off O

" O
I O

says O
Hof B-PER
, O
who O
is O
impressed O
by O
the O
" O
amazing O
pragmatism O
of O
the O
young O
people O
. O

Very O
quickly O
they O
had O
seen O
through O
how O
local O
politics O
worked O
. O
" O

And O
then O
it O
makes O
sense O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
just O
complain O
like O
a O

they O

something O

now O

that O

hope O
that O
is O
also O
shared O
by O
the O
SPD B-MISC
faction I-MISC
leader I-MISC
Beate B-PER
Fleige I-PER
. O

She O
considers O
it O
crucial O
that O
" O
now O
the O
young O

themselves O
articulate O
what O
they O
need O
" O

So O
much O

says O
against O
it O
the O
CDU B-MISC

Franz B-PER
Kaunzner I-PER

He O
regards O
the O
youth O

above O
all O
as O
a O
practice O

: O

" O
If O
one O
looks O
at O
oneself O

, O
how O
large O
the O
ignorance O
is O
" O
, O
the O
co O

operation O
in O
the O
youth O
parliament O
can O
contribute O
with O
the O
young O
people O
quite O
to O
the O
opinion O
formation O
. O

What O
he O
cautions O
, O
however O
, O
is O
continuity O
: O

" O
If O
they O
send O
a O
different O
representative O
every O
time O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
. O
" O

The O
young O
people O
have O
also O
recognized O
this O
: O

They O
do O
not O
want O
to O
pay O
homage O
to O
the O
principle O
of O
rotation O
. O

But O
they O
too O
will O
outgrow O
adolescence O
one O
day O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
their O
election O
period O
is O
one O
year O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

What O
comes O
after O
that O
, O
even O
the O
young O

do O
not O
know O
. O

They O
resolutely O
refuse O

: O

" O
Nothing O

Those O
who O

party O
go O
straight O

without O

According O

According O

the O

the O

said O
the O

It O
is O
important O
to O

can O
always O

There O
are O
rarely O

the O

Even O
if O
the O

sometimes O
seems O
martial O
to O

have O

down O

, O
senseless O

are O
left O

Reiner B-PER

the O
rat O
poison O
is O
put O
into O
the O

' O

and O
weighted O
down O
with O
bait O
. O

In O

The O
danger O
for O

However O

should O
not O

Reiner B-PER

: O

" O
Big O

rats O
are O
used O
to O
people O

They O
are O
relatively O
cheeky O
. O
" O

A O
direct O
danger O
does O
not O
emanate O
from O
them O
; O
they O
also O
do O
not O
normally O
attack O
people O
. O

As O
pests O
according O
to O
the O
Federal O
Law O
on O
epidemics O
, O
the O
animals O
are O
considered O
because O
they O
can O
possibly O
transmit O
diseases O
via O
the O
rat O
flea O
. O

But O
only O
if O
the O

itself O

the O

elects O
three O
working O

a O

The O
then O
deputy O
head O
of O
the O
local O

Margret B-PER
Steen I-PER

hoped O
that O
the O

work O
on O
more O

three O

. O

Excessive O
expectations O
, O
as O
soon O
turned O
out O

Margret B-PER
Steen I-PER
has O
now O
left O
the O

, O
in O
the O
core O
of O
Bokenheim B-LOC

in O
the O
southern O
Bockenheim B-LOC

be O
driven O
only O
with O
30 O
kilometers O
per O
hour O
- O
but O
in O
the O
Westend B-LOC
has O
done O
nothing O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
September O
last O
year O
, O
the O
advisory O
council O
working O
group O
presented O
its O
concept O
. O

Not O

up O
, O
also O
the O

A O

and O
promptly O
came O
the O
objection O
of O

: O

The O
traffic O

be O
changed O
in O

many O

was O
said O
in O
December O
1991 O
in O
a O
short O
statement O
, O
the O
effects O
on O
the O
superordinate O

would O
be O
too O
momentous O

, O
at O

for O
understanding O

This O
applies O
to O
both O
the O
content O
and O
the O
formal O
side O
of O
the O
process O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O
Westend B-LOC
, O
with O
its O
high O
- O
rise O
buildings O
and O
numerous O
one O

is O
" O
a O
tough O
nut O
to O
crack O
, O
" O
even O
for O

. O

This O
is O
also O
true O
for O
the O
members O
of O
the O
advisory O
board O
who O
, O
despite O
intensive O
work O
, O
were O
only O
able O
to O
put O
a O
concept O
on O
the O
table O
after O
one O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

And O
although O
so O
long O
had O
been O
discussed O
, O
there O
was O
not O
even O
consensus O
within O
the O
council O
: O

The O
CDU B-ORG
rejected O
the O

. O

How O

finally O
also O
the O
formal O
procedure O
is O
, O
can O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
events O
since O
April O
this O

. O

Although O
advisory O

and O
working O

agreed O
in O
principle O
on O
the O
traffic O

, O
the O

can O

In O
May O
Jürgen B-PER
Frauenfeld I-PER
, O
who O
supports O
the O
advisory O

technically O
, O
submitted O
an O
amended O
plan O
to O
the O
city O
. O

On O
17 O
June O
this O
had O
been O
examined O
- O
as O
usual O
- O
according O
to O
purely O
formal O
aspects O
and O
Frauenfeld B-PER
was O
informed O
that O
he O
could O
now O
hand O
in O
the O

in O

execution O
. O

This O
happened O
on O
June O
25 O
. O

The O

were O
distributed O
, O
the O

remained O
14 O
days O
for O

At O
the O
next O
meeting O
of O
the O
working O

on O
July O
25 O
a O
decision O
was O
not O
made O
, O
the O

was O
too O
extensive O
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
August O
4 O
that O
the O

were O
discussed O
. O

Result O
: O

They O
were O
not O
complete O
, O
the O

had O
to O
submit O
new O

. O

On O
the O

with O
the O

are O
not O
to O

recognized O

the O

, O
which O
are O
to O
set O
later O
the O

, O
needed O
plans O
in O
the O
scale O
1:250 O

Jürgen B-PER
Frauenfeld I-PER
has O
now O
asked O
for O
four O
to O
six O
weeks O
to O
draw O
the O
plans O
. O

Provided O
that O
the O
municipal O
working O
group O
then O
agrees O
, O
another O
three O
to O
four O
months O
must O
be O
expected O
. O

Ordnungsamt O
and O
road O
construction O
office O
need O
according O
to O
experience O
of O
Klaus B-PER
Janz I-PER
on O
the O
average O
six O
to O
eight O
weeks O
each O
, O
in O
order O
to O
convert O
the O
plans O
: O

" O
But O
that O
only O
applies O
if O
there O
is O
no O
major O
backlog O
of O
work O
, O
such O
as O
at O
trade O
fairs O
. O
" O

For O
Klaus B-PER
Janz I-PER
, O
the O
southern O
Westend B-LOC
is O
also O
an O
unusual O
case O
. O

Already O
after O
the O
second O
meeting O
is O
usually O
decided O
in O
principle O
on O
the O
zones O
. O

Clear O
is O
also O
for O
him O
: O

" O
If O
the O
Westend B-LOC
were O
our O
only O
thing O
, O
which O
we O
have O
on O
the O
desk O
, O
then O
this O
could O
also O
go O
more O
quickly O
. O
" O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
does O
not O
tire O
of O
emphasizing O
that O
there O
is O
a O
" O
basic O
consensus O
" O
with O
the O
planning O
of O
the O
local O
council O
. O

Because O
locally O
already O
rumors O
had O
appeared O
, O
the O
municipal O
office O
of O
order O
wants O
to O
shake O
again O
at O
principles O
of O
the O
new O
traffic O
guidance O
. O

When O
then O
the O
speed-30 O
- O
signs O
in O
the O
Westend B-LOC
are O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
about O
it O
no O
office O
wants O
to O
speculate O
. O

How O
said O
nevertheless O
a O
involved O
planner O
: O

" O
If O
I O
were O
clairvoyant O
, O
then O
I O
would O
earn O
my O
money O
elsewhere O

Speed O

The O

She O
still O
has O
four O

the O

forces O
her O
to O
stop O
on O
the O

There O
is O

Günther B-PER

already O
made O
this O
experience O
painfully O
. O

Recently O
he O
wanted O
to O
cross O
the O
avenue O
with O
four O
children O
, O
almost O
he O
was O
run O
over O
. O

The O
shock O
has O
meanwhile O
turned O
into O
anger O
: O

" O
Something O
must O
be O
done O
about O
this O
. O
" O

Resident O
Gisela B-PER
Becker I-PER
considers O
the O
" O
motorway O
- O
like O
" O
expansion O
of O
the O
road O
a O
fundamental O
mistake O
. O

Because O
cars O
are O
allowed O
to O
drive O
at O
60 O
kilometers O
per O
hour O
on O
the O
road O
between O
Bokkenheim B-LOC
and O
the O
Westend B-LOC
. O

Also O
in O
the O
local B-ORG
advisory I-ORG
council I-ORG
2 I-ORG
is O
thought O
about O
how O
the O
connection O
of O
the O
districts O
could O
be O
made O
safer O
. O

Already O
in O
1991 O
the O
council O
had O
demanded O
a O
bus O
lane O
to O
push O
back O
the O
car O
traffic O
to O
five O
lanes O
- O
in O
vain O
. O

Now O
the O
district O
politicians O
have O
launched O
a O
new O
initiative O
: O

Tempo O
30 O
on O
the O
Alleenring B-LOC
they O
demanded O
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
SPD B-MISC
faction I-MISC
for O
the O
section O
between O
the O
junction O
of O
Sophienstraße B-LOC
and O
the O
intersection O
Bockenheimer B-LOC
Landstraße I-LOC
( O
the O
FR B-ORG
reported O
) O
. O

" O
The O
existing O
islands O
are O
so O
narrow O
in O
their O
width O
" O
, O
Günter B-PER
Zenk I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
justified O
the O
initiative O
, O
" O
that O
actually O
only O
collapsible O
bicycles O
should O
be O
allowed O
. O
" O

But O
also O
the O
advance O
has O
little O
chance O
to O
be O
implemented O
. O

Klaus B-PER
Wetterling I-PER
, O
in O
the O
office O
for O
municipal O
overall O
development O
and O
urban O
planning O
responsible O
for O
traffic O
concept O
, O
waves O
it O
off O
: O

No O
legal O
possibilities O
. O

In O
the O
general O
traffic O
plan O
, O
the O
road O
marked O
in O
blue O
signals O
: O

Attention O
, O
main O
traffic O
road O
. O

Wetterling B-PER
: O

" O
There O
we O
can O
not O
simply O
order O
speed O
30 O
. O
" O

That O
is O
only O
possible O
if O
" O
the O
local O
situation O
shows O
a O
narrow O
road O
" O
. O

But O
here O
, O
as O
traffic O
initiatives O
in O
other O
cases O
have O
already O
emphasized O
, O
the O
cat O
bites O
the O
tail O
: O

There O
is O
speeding O
because O
the O
road O
is O
wide O
; O
and O
because O
the O
road O
is O
wide O
, O
the O
speed O
limit O
may O
not O
be O
drastically O
reduced O
. O

So O
the O
speeding O
continues O
. O

Anton B-PER
Winter I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
had O
already O
suspected O
during O
the O
meeting O
of O
the O
advisory O
board O
that O
the O
city O
would O
not O
prescribe O
speed O
30 O
on O
the O
Alleenring B-LOC
under O
any O
circumstances O
- O
and O
thus O
also O
justified O
the O
refusal O
of O
his O
parliamentary O
group O
. O

With O
a O
speed O
reduction O
it O
is O
not O
done O
, O
meant O
winter B-PER
beyond O
that O
. O

Rather O
the O
islands O
must O
be O
enlarged O
. O

Only O
then O
the O
pedestrians O
would O
be O
safer O
. O

A O
view O
that O
also O
supported O
Günther B-PER
Boege I-PER
. O

But O
the O
SPD B-MISC
faction I-MISC
could O
not O
make O
friends O
with O
the O
idea O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

A O
reconstruction O
of O
the O
entire O
intersection O
will O
only O
make O
sense O
, O
argued O
its O
chairman O
Bernd B-PER
Scherf I-PER
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
subway O
construction O
will O
be O
completed O
. O

Before O
such O
a O
project O
is O
much O
too O
expensive O
. O

Traffic O
planner O
Klaus B-PER
Wetterling I-PER
shares O
this O
view O
. O

Only O
six O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
square O
had O
been O
redesigned O
during O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
subway O
. O
" O

Even O
if O
we O
do O
not O
need O
every O
lane O
, O
why O
should O
we O
now O
pay O
for O
a O
redesign O

by O
the O

Only O
now O
she O
realizes O
what O
the O

of O

why O
she O

: O

The O
senior O

Now O
she O
is O
fighting O
to O
keep O
the O

alive O

Immediately O
after O
her O

she O
took O

of O

went O
on O

learned O
a O

about O
the O

The O
portrait O

Again O

again O
she O
tells O
that O

Hildegard B-PER

She O
does O
not O
mince O
her O
words O

If O
she O
wants O
to O
achieve O
something O
, O
she O
does O
everything O
for O
it O
. O

Not O
infrequently O
she O
has O
fought O
against O
windmills O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
however O
, O
she O
is O
overcome O
by O
a O
feeling O
that O
frightens O
her O
a O
little O
: O

Indifference O
. O

In O
the O
past O
she O
never O
shied O
away O
from O
confrontation O
, O
now O
she O
sometimes O
takes O
the O
path O
of O
least O
resistance O
. O

Maybe O
her O
energy O
reserves O
are O
simply O
exhausted O
? O

That O
would O
be O
no O

After O

she O
had O
to O
start O
all O

again O

Already O
in O
1969 O
her O

She O
was O
forced O
to O
manage O
her O
life O
alone O
as O
a O
working O
woman O

mother O

Two O
years O

her O

died O
of O
a O
heart O
attack O

A O
shock O
that O
Hildegard B-PER
Baier I-PER
has O
not O
overcome O
until O
today O
. O

Sometimes O
depressions O
attack O
her O
since O
then O

She O
then O
sits O

cries O

" O

You O
can O
overcome O
loneliness O

but O
not O
loneliness O
, O
" O
she O
says O
in O
a O
trembling O
voice O

These O
are O
exactly O
the O
moments O
when O
her O
fighter O
nature O

again O

Then O
she O
starts O

" O

When O
I O

there O

my O

out O

I O
ask O
myself O

She O

time O
she O
succeeds O

But O
she O
does O

It O
probably O
does O

fit O

: O

Being O

on O
the O

the O
Otto B-LOC

, O
one O
thing O
is O
certain O
: O

The O
Nieder B-MISC

Eschbacher I-MISC
will O
have O
to O
be O
patient O
still O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
situation O
with O
the O
Michael B-LOC
Grzimek I-LOC
school I-LOC
is O
extremely O
desirable O
for O
the O
primary O
school O
pupils O
, O
but O
hardly O
to O
realize O
. O

The O
gymnasium O
existing O
there O
, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
too O
small O
already O
years O
ago O
, O
would O
have O
to O
be O
torn O
down O
for O
it O
. O

That O
would O
have O
the O
consequence O
that O
the O
school O
lessons O
would O
be O
disturbed O
for O
at O
least O
two O
years O
by O
building O
noise O
. O

In O
the O

also O
no O

be O

In O
addition O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC
school O

sport O
departmental O
head O
Sylvia B-PER

represents O
the O
opinion O
that O
due O

the O

the O

no O
intact O
resounding O
, O
may O
be O
it O
also O
still O
so O
small O
, O
may O
be O
torn O
down O
. O

Particularly O
in O
Nieder B-LOC
- I-LOC
Eschbach I-LOC
, O
where O
anyway O
only O
two O
gymnasiums O
and O
a O
gymnastics O
room O
are O
available O
, O
such O
an O
action O
would O
aggravate O
the O
bottleneck O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
larger O
hall O
on O
the O
site O
of O
the O
Michael B-LOC
Grzimek I-LOC
School I-LOC
would O
reduce O
the O
size O
of O
the O
playground B-LOC
. O

Also O
the O
district O
sports O
facility O
is O
ruled O
out O
as O
a O
location O
for O
the O
new O
hall O
. O

The O
students O
of O
MGS B-LOC
, O
who O
can O
not O
all O
fit O
in O
the O
school O
's O
own O
gymnasium O
, O
would O
need O
fifteen O
minutes O
on O
foot O
to O
get O
there O
. O

With O
a O
physical O
education O
class O
of O
only O
45 O
minutes O
, O
this O
would O
not O
be O
sustainable O
. O

The O
only O
option O
left O
is O
to O
build O
the O
new O
hall O
on O
the O
Otto B-LOC
Hahn I-LOC
School I-LOC
sports O
field O
. O

Since O
the O
outdoor O
sports O

is O
contaminated O
with O
dioxins O
and O
the O
students O
have O
been O
using O
the O
district O

as O
a O
substitute O
for O
some O
time O
now O
, O
the O
OHS B-LOC

its O

this O

would O
be O
easy O

in O

Therefore O
, O
there O
was O
no O

there O

, O
the O
coordination O

want O
to O
reach O
also O
and O
above O
all O
the O
new O
generation O
, O
it O
is O
not O
sufficient O
in O
its O
opinion O
to O
sing O
only O
Ännchen B-PER

, O
but O
with O
pieces O
from O
Musicals O
and O
modern O

also O
the O

for O
the O
choir O
singing O
to O
inspire O
. O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
singers O
see O
themselves O
as O
victims O
of O
the O
dilemma O
that O
a O
composer O
only O
composes O
if O
he O
also O
knows O
that O
this O
work O
will O
be O
bought O
. O

And O
this O
, O
according O
to O
Claus O
- O
Peter B-PER
Blaschke I-PER
, O
is O
still O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
with O
modern O
music O
. O

The O
trend O
of O
many O
choirs O
is O
still O
to O
sing O
( O
and O
to O
buy O
) O
what O
one O
knows O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
choirs O
have O
little O
literature O
that O
appeals O
to O
young O
people O
, O
explains O
Blaschke B-PER
, O
who O
waxes O
lyrical O
about O
the O
choir O

arrangements O
of O
the O

" O
Let O

New O

, O
in O
his O
view O

allowed O
a O
stronger O
engagement O
with O
the O

" O

When O
I O
see O
our O

I O
can O

Oh O

you O
beautiful O
forest O
' O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
thing O
has O
a O
meaning O
. O

But O
a O
contemporary O
composer O
could O
also O
write O
a O
work O
about O
the O
dying O
of O
the O
forest O
. O

But O
he O
only O
does O
so O
if O
he O
can O

it O

" O

Only O
if O
a O

is O
found O
for O
this O
, O
the O
clubs O
open O
up O
to O
the O

and O
look O
after O
them O
, O
the O
choral O
singing O
can O
have O
a O
future O
in O
his O
opinion O
. O

Some O

in O

predicts O
then O
also O
their O

Other O

let O
him O
look O
hopeful O
into O
the O
future O
. O

Especially O
since O
the O
singing O
for O
him O
beyond O
the O
purely O
musical O
also O
still O
promotes O
the O
" O
sense O

the O

dynamic O
aspect O
as O
an O
" O
important O
by O

of O

But O
he O
also O
finds O
that O
" O
singing O
is O
liberating O

and O
" O
simply O
fun O
" O
for O
most O

It O
should O
be O
even O
more O

, O
he O
is O

the O

this O

The O

request O
, O
the O
buses O
of O
the O
line O

in O
the O
rush O
hours O
every O
10 O
, O
until O
20 O
o'clock O
every O
20 O
minutes O
and O
afterwards O
every O
half O

to O
let O

. O

So O
that O
with O
a O
denser O
cycle O
of O
the O
" O

" O
nevertheless O
as O
many O
places O
as O
possible O
with O
passengers O
are O
occupied O
, O
smaller O
buses O
are O
to O
be O
used O
. O

The O
local O
advisory O
council O
agreed O
to O
the O
request O
against O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
CDU B-MISC
faction I-MISC
. O

As O
its O
chairman O
Dieter B-PER
Kunzler I-PER
said O
, O
the O
44er O
is O
anyway O
a O
" O
ghost O
bus O
" O
, O
which O
is O
hardly O
used O
especially O
in O
the O
evening O
hours O
. O

He O
described O
it O
as O
" O
not O
particularly O
meaningful O
" O
to O
let O
the O
bus O
roll O
even O
more O
frequently O
" O
through O
the O
narrow O
streets O
of O
Fechenheim B-LOC
" O
. O

This O
is O
not O
an O
argument O
against O
a O
shorter O
time O
interval O
, O
said O
Albrecht B-PER
Reinhard I-PER
( O
FDP B-ORG
) O
. O

Precisely O
because O
the O
bus O
runs O
so O
infrequently O
, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
cheap O
means O
of O
transport O
and O
is O
therefore O
little O
used O
. O

This O
will O
change O
if O
the O
44er O
runs O
more O
frequently O
, O
speculated O
the O
Free O
Democrat O
. O

This O
has O
been O
confirmed O
after O
a O
magistrate O
's O
report O
everywhere O
where O
the O
bus O
is O
easy O
to O
reach O
with O
the O
subway O
, O
said O
Reinhard B-PER
. O

The O
second O
part O
of O
the O
SPD B-MISC
application I-MISC
demanded O
to O
couple O
the O
departure O
times O
of O
the O
bus O
at O
the O
stop O
Gwinnerstraße B-LOC
in O
Borsigallee B-LOC
with O
the O
subway O
of O
line O
7 O
. O

Instead O
of O
every O
third O
one O
, O
the O
FVV B-MISC
customers I-MISC
should O
then O
change O
from O
every O
second O
subway O
without O
long O
waiting O
in O
the O
future O
in O
the O
44er O
. O

which O
it O
had O
organized O
together O
with O

on O
the O
" O
Burglehen B-LOC
" O
- O
in O
the O
district O
as O
" O
Linneplatz B-LOC
" O
admits O
. O

Aim O
of O
the O
action O
: O

The O
adults O
wanted O
to O
show O
that O
their O
older O
offspring O
lack O
equipment O
to O
play O
on O
the O
playground O
there O
. O

The O
place O
had O
been O
furnished O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Another O
shortcoming O
: O

The O
place O
is O
often O
driven O
on O
by O
cars O
which O
have O
nothing O
to O
look O
for O
there O
. O

Because O
the O
" O
Burglehen O
" O
, O
a O
large O
square O
paved O
with O
square O
stones O
in O
the O
Fechenheimer B-MISC
local O
center O
, O
is O
pedestrian O
zone O
. O

Actually O
, O
only O
some O
residents O
with O
appropriate O
passes O
are O
allowed O
to O
drive O
over O
the O
" O
Linneplatz B-LOC
" O
, O
between O
5 O
and O
11 O
o'clock O
are O
also O
allowed O
suppliers O
. O

Initially O
, O
the O
parents O
therefore O
wanted O
to O
block O
the O
Starkenburger B-LOC
Straße I-LOC
, O
from O
which O
the O
square O
can O
be O
reached O
, O
during O
the O
play O
week O
. O

Since O
the O
action O
was O
supported O
however O
by O
two O
fee O
forces O
, O
the O
initiative O
had O
to O
give O
up O
this O
project O
again O
. O

Because O
the O
employees O
of O
an O
authority O
are O
expressly O
forbidden O
to O
take O
part O
in O
such O
- O
soberly O
considered O
- O
illegal O
actions O
. O

But O
the O
parents O
did O
not O
want O
to O
do O
without O
the O
help O
of O
the O
two O
educators O
and O
the O
playground O
equipment O
of O
the O
Children O
's O
Office O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
play O
week O
" O
went O
well O
" O
even O
without O
a O
roadblock O
, O
said O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
, O
mother O
of O
five O
children O
. O

On O
the O
first O
two O
days O
, O
about O
30 O
children O
were O
there O
, O
painted O
and O
played O
in O
the O
self O

. O
" O

Everything O
that O
moves O
in O

, O
the O
little O

drew O
on O
two O

which O
still O
have O
to O
be O
sewn O
together O
. O

Also O
a O
wall O
of O
the O
playground O
is O
still O
being O
painted O
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
of O
the O
play O
week O
, O
the O
rain O
temporarily O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O

and O
bustle O
around O
the O
" O
Linnespielplatz B-LOC
" O
. O

Already O
about O
three O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
responsible O
local O
council O
advocated O
to O
close O
the O
" O
Burglehen B-LOC
" O
for O
through O
traffic O
and O
to O
establish O
a O
children O
's O
playground O
there O
. O

In O
the O
past O
year O
a O
small O
playground O
was O
put O
on O
in O
a O
corner O
in O
the O
front O
range O
of O
the O
place O
at O
the O
Starkenburger B-LOC
road I-LOC
. O

Some O
sand O
, O
a O
few O
playground O
equipment O
- O
for O
boys O
and O
girls O
who O
are O
no O
longer O
in O
toddler O
age O
, O
the O
offer O
is O
somewhat O
meager O
. O

That O
will O
become O
better O
in O
the O
future O
: O

The O
city O
youth O
welfare O
office O
wants O
to O
equip O
the O
" O
Linnespielplatz B-LOC
" O
additionally O
with O
balls O
, O
tires O
, O
stilts O
and O
other O
playground O
equipment O
. O

The O
toys O
will O
be O
placed O
in O
a O
lockable O
box O
and O
some O
keys O
will O
be O
distributed O
to O
the O
parents O
. O

The O
little O
ones O
will O
have O
to O
do O
without O
the O
wooden O
playhouse O
that O
the O
children O
wanted O
. O

The O
construction O
of O
such O
a O
hut O
is O
too O
costly O
and O
also O
linked O
to O
numerous O
safety O
requirements O
, O
explained O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
. O

A O
wooden O
climbing O
frame O
from O
the O
children O
's O
office O
provided O
a O
substitute O
during O
the O
play O
week O
. O

A O
major O
drawback O
of O
the O
playground O
remains O
: O

It O
is O
simply O
too O
small O
to O
accommodate O
all O
the O
children O
who O
want O
to O
play O
there O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
offspring O
has O
already O
taken O
possession O
of O
part O
of O
the O
Linneplatz B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
however O
, O
the O
children O
do O
not O
play O
undisturbed O
. O

Because O
, O
as O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
reported O
, O
cars O
and O
trucks O
repeatedly O
pass O
through O
the O
pedestrian O
zone O
without O
permission O
, O
and O
sometimes O
" O
the O

parked O
up O
" O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
the O
parents O
have O
been O
campaigning O
through O
the O
local O
council O
for O
the O
unauthorized O
traffic O
to O
be O
effectively O
banned O
from O
the O
Burglehen O
. O

Their O
efforts O
remained O
so O
far O
unsuccessful O
despite O
promises O
of O
the O
magistrate O
. O

Proposal O
of O
the O
officials O
of O

: O

In O
the O

, O

pass O

" O

dispute O
about O
the O

back O
further O
, O
however O
. O

A O

had O
withdrawn O
the O

at O
that O
time O
. O

The O
SPD B-MISC

had O
criticized O

in O
the O

, O
the O

refused O

a O
few O
" O

When O
the O

also O
ruled O
in O
Wiesbaden B-LOC
, O
the O
magistrate O
presented O
a O
second O
plan O
, O
which O
hardly O
differed O
from O
the O
first O
. O

Then O
in O

, O

the O

the O

That O
there O

yet O

, O
is O
due O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
to O
the O
complex O

procedure O
for O
the O

: O

The O

exception O
is O
the O

1060 O

in O
the O
west O
of O
the O
area O
, O
on O
which O
a O

number O
( O

the O

Without O

, O
only O
a O

due O

the O

conditions O
would O
not O

only O
for O

The O
two O

said O
the O

about O
the O
growing O

of O

of O
the O

" O

Basically O
, O
Kleinert B-PER
thinks O
, O
the O
Western O
party O
democracies O
have O
produced O
an O
increasingly O
differentiated O
, O
highly O
complex O
network O
of O
institutions O
. O

In O
it O
, O
in O
the O
sum O
of O
the O
actions O
of O
a O
multitude O
of O
different O
actors O
produced O
a O
growing O
inflexibility O
of O
the O
overall O
system O
. O
" O

Coarsening O
one O
could O
say O
: O

An O
ever O
greater O
number O
of O
participants O
produces O
more O
and O
more O
noise O
at O
the O
most O
diverse O
levels O
of O
politics O
, O
administration O
and O
jurisdiction O
. O

Relatively O
little O
is O
achieved O
in O
the O
matter O
by O
the O
growing O
volume O
. O

Because O
this O
is O
so O
, O
politics O
takes O
refuge O
in O
symbolic O
actions O
to O
an O
increasing O
extent O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
meets O
the O
laws O
of O
media O
democracy O
. O

Actions O
are O
replaced O
by O
demonstrations O
of O
thoughtfulness O
, O
assurances O
that O
the O
problem O
is O
taken O
seriously O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O
" O

Kleinert B-PER
sees O
in O
the O
development O
outlined O
by O
him O
also O
a O
reverse O
side O
of O
the O
democratization O
push O
, O
which O
has O
produced O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
years O
a O
considerable O
gain O
in O
freedom O
of O
decision O
for O
the O
individual O
. O

Politics O
has O
made O
it O
more O
difficult O
to O
legitimize O
itself O
, O
and O
the O
willingness O
to O
accept O
unquestioningly O
the O
decisions O
of O
higher O
authorities O
is O
decreasing O
. O

Also O
the O
sense O
for O
" O
formalized O
social O
relations O
" O
, O
i.e. O
parties O
, O
trade O
unions O
or O
even O
associations O
, O
is O
decreasing O
. O

According O
to O
Kleinert B-PER
, O
the O
weakness O
of O
politics O
is O
also O
the O
price O
that O
the O
societies O
of O
the O
West O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
their O
high O
degree O
of O
pluralism O
of O
interests O
, O
opinions O
and O
lifestyles O
. O
" O

The O
main O
question O
is O
whether O
the O
level O
of O
democratization O
of O
the O
1980s O
can O
be O
maintained O
under O
the O
difficult O
conditions O
of O
the O
1990s O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
lack O
of O
memorable O
personalities O
, O
and O
too O
many O
politicians O
seem O
interchangeable O
, O
" O
a O
bit O
like O
off O
- O
the O
- O
peg O
politicians O
, O
" O
Kleinert B-PER
writes O
. O

However O
, O
they O
are O
also O
a O
reflection O
of O
society O
, O
because O
such O
complaints O
also O
exist O
in O
other O
professions O
, O
in O
sports O
, O
in O
the O
arts O
and O
in O
business O
. O
" O

Most O
certainly O
" O
, O
says O
Kleinert B-PER
, O
" O
the O
leadership O
ability O
of O
political O
personnel O
has O
decreased O
, O
while O
the O
vanity O
of O
individual O
performers O
has O
increased O
. O
" O

With O
increasing O
tendency O
, O
politicians O
tended O
to O
draw O
their O
judgments O
about O
themselves O
and O
their O
political O
performance O
solely O
from O
their O
reflection O
in O
the O
media O
. O

This O
necessitates O
snapshots O
and O
spectacle O
, O
which O
sometimes O
makes O
a O
fuss O
, O
but O
is O
then O
often O
quickly O
forgotten O
. O

In O
addition O
there O
is O
the O
libertarian O
spirit O
of O
the O
times O
with O
mere O
moderating O
instead O
of O
leading O

Uwe B-PER

titled O
his O

The O
nude O
photographs O
speak O
of O
the O
desire O
for O
certain O
views O
of O
a O
certain O
body O
ideal O
. O

In O

the O

for O

In O

and O

( O
and O

) O
. O

The O
facets O
of O
this O
genre O
are O
impressively O
documented O
in O
the O
show O
. O

But O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
all O
these O
stylizations O
, O
the O
erotic O
, O
lust O
itself O
can O
hardly O
unfold O
. O

the O
selection O
, O
in O

, O
a O
historical O
overview O
of O

given O
. O

The O
models O
are O
draped O
in O

of O
the O
phallic O
bellows O
of O
the O
camera O
in O
ever O
new O

poses O

The O
German B-MISC
erotic O
photographers O
in O
the O
30s O
were O
concerned O
with O
an O
aseptic O
touch O
: O

The O
free O
body O
culture O
offered O
here O
the O
casual O
occasion O
to O
produce O
as O
forced O
, O
dignified O
body O
images O
as O
possible O
. O

Up O
to O
the O
more O
impudent O
, O
more O
aggressive O
pictures O
of O
the O
current O
nude O
photography O
, O
some O
similarities O
of O
this O
genre O
can O
be O
found O
. O

Mostly O
the O
body O
is O
used O
as O
a O
docile O
material O
, O
sometimes O
as O
a O
whole O
nude O
figure O
, O
sometimes O
as O
a O
fragmented O
body O
landscape O
. O

The O
lust O
of O
the O
sitter O
plays O
almost O
no O
role O
- O
what O
these O
pictures O
reveal O
again O
and O
again O
are O
rather O
the O
fantasies O
of O
the O
photographers O
, O
projected O
onto O
the O
bodies O
of O
their O
choice O
. O

And O
this O
not O
always O
particularly O
imaginative O
. O

This O
becomes O
particularly O
clear O
in O
the O
historical O
distance O
. O

The O
pornographic O
pictures O
from O
the O
early O
days O
of O
photography O
, O
around O
1850 O
, O
seem O
only O
as O
picture O
witnesses O
of O
their O
taste O
of O
the O
time O
, O
hardly O
as O
erotic O
photographs O
. O

In O
touching O
plumpness O
the O
naked O
models O
are O
photographed O
, O
whereby O
the O
long O
exposure O
times O
might O
have O
intensified O
the O
somewhat O
wooden O
poses O
. O

The O
unashamed O
and O
unrepentant O
voyeuristic O
experience O
of O
the O
viewer O
is O
the O
real O
goal O
of O
these O
pictures O
- O
their O
design O
secondary O
. O

The O
lust O
had O
already O
disappeared O
from O
the O
picture O
at O
that O
time O
. O

The O
partly O
drastic O
stagings O
of O
newer O
date O
aim O
mostly O
at O
the O
same O
, O
old O
effects O
. O

There O
it O
is O
restful O
to O
see O
also O
alternatives O
to O
these O
spread O
beauties O
. O

Far O
away O
from O
common O
ideals O
stands O
for O
example O
a O
breast O
portrait O
of O
Gundula B-PER
Schulze I-PER
. O

An O
old O
lady O
, O
furrowed O
, O
somewhat O
uncertain O
, O
but O
very O
serious O
looking O
into O
the O
camera O
. O

The O
direct O
look O
out O
of O
the O
picture O
makes O
us O
frightened O
, O
visualize O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
voyeur O
. O

And O
so O
the O
woman O
appears O
as O
a O
dignified O
portrait O
, O
a O
character O
study O
, O
not O
an O
object O
of O
lust O
. O

Similar O
to O
the O
old O
couple O
, O
which O
the O
Swede B-MISC
Jan B-PER
Bengtsson I-PER
captured O
in O
a O
tender O
embrace O
. O

Scheidt B-PER
writes O
in O
the O
preface O
of O
the O
accompanying O
catalog O
that O
he O
has O
compiled O
" O
a O
purely O
subjective O
selection O
" O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
he O
does O
not O
make O
any O
high O
art O
claims O
. O

The O
exhibition O
should O
be O
viewed O
and O
- O
in O
the O
best O
case O
- O
enjoyed O
just O
as O
subjectively O

That O

" O

In O
1982 O
, O
parents O
of O
children O
with O

had O
decided O
to O
do O
something O
about O
the O
miserable O
conditions O
in O
the O
children O

ward O
at O
the O
University O

Too O
small O
rooms O
and O
unsatisfactory O
care O
of O
children O
and O
parents O
were O
the O
main O
points O
of O
criticism O
. O

There O
are O
still O
only O
two O
toilets O
and O
two O
showers O
for O
the O
children O

and O
parents O
. O

But O
the O
situation O
on O
the O
ward O
of O
Professor O
Bernhard B-PER
Kornhuber I-PER
has O
improved O
considerably O
in O
recent O
years O
: O

The O

From O
October O

it O

was O

custom O
to O
which O
the O

celebrated O
just O
these O
days O
in O

shall O
remind O
. O

Back O
to O
the O
artichoke B-LOC
fountain I-LOC
: O

In O
1789 O
, O
the O
Dribbdebächer O
had O
a O
column O
with O
pump O
construction O
built O
instead O
of O
the O
medieval O
draw O
well O
. O

The O
stone O
was O
decorated O
on O
four O
sides O
with O
a O
wreath O
, O
which O
, O
as O
Helga B-PER
Heil I-PER
writes O
in O
her O
book O
about O
the O
Sachsenhausen B-MISC
fountain B-MISC
festival I-MISC
, O
bore O
the O
" O
names O
of O
the O
fountain O
sheriff O
, O
the O
fountain O
masters O
and O
the O
stonemason O
" O
. O

Above O
the O
cranked O
cornice O
finally O
rises O
as O
a O
decoration O
a O
vase O
, O
which O
resembles O
an O
artichoke O
. O

This O
motif O
is O
repeated O
again O
in O
the O
cover O
of O
the O
vase O
. O

Renovated O
in O
1888 O
, O
the O
fountain O
survived O
the O
war O
without O
damage O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
was O
destroyed O
shortly O
afterwards O
: O

A O
carriage O
tore O
him O
over O

When O
the O
sculptor O
Georg B-PER
Krämer I-PER

they O
chose O
a O

His O

: O

" O

" O

That O
was O
- O
in O
those O
troubled O
times O
- O
certainly O
not O
a O
wrong O
consideration O

And O
it O
should O
be O
confirmed O
: O

On O
March O
8 O
of O
that O
year O
, O
the O
citizens O
of O
the O
neighboring O
town O
held O
a O
protest O
meeting O
, O
subsequently O
stormed O
the O
station O
and O
started O
passenger O
service O
with O
self O
- O
elected O
personnel O
. O

Proper O
fares O
and O
conductors O
were O
then O
only O
in O
April O
of O
the O
same O
year O
. O

In O
1875 O
the O
line O
was O
shortened O
and O
the O
local B-LOC

was O
rebuilt O
to O
a O
terminus B-LOC

But O
under O
" O

the O

went O
ahead O
: O

The O

of O
the O
local O

got O
competition O
only O
nine O
years O
later O
- O
and O

. O

In O
1884 O
, O
the O

opened O
as O
one O
of O
the O

Criticism O
of O

arose O

Already O
in O
1901 O
it O
was O
said O
that O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
up O
to O
date O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
the O
favorable O
routing O
of O
the O
streetcar O
through O
Oberrad B-LOC
that O
led O
to O
the O
final O
end O

in O
1955 O

In O
between O
there O
was O
the O
destruction O

the O

It O
fell O
partially O
victim O
to O
the O

Gradually O
the O

removed O

the O

about O

to O

now O
in O

the O

: O

In O
questionnaires O
, O
which O
are O
distributed O
during O

hearing O
, O
the O
residents O
could O
express O
their O
opinion O

decide O
for O
one O
of O
the O

The O
numbering O
of O

ensure O
that O
everyone O

Thus O
, O
argue O
the O
Greens B-ORG
, O
the O
traffic O
calming O
in O
the O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC

not O
delayed O
even O

Already O
in O
the O
September O

the O
local O

could O
make O
a O
decision O
. O

The O
CDU B-ORG
, O
the O

fraction O
in O
the O
local B-ORG
advisory I-ORG
council I-ORG

, O
wants O
to O
know O
nothing O

it O
. O

In O
their O
opinion O
only O
a O
more O
complex O
procedure O
can O
guarantee O
that O
the O
process O
runs O
democratically O
. O

Each O
inhabitant O
around O
the O
Kurhessenstrasse B-LOC
is O
to O
receive O
a O
questionnaire O
, O
on O
which O
the O
variants O
are O
explained O
. O

Because O
also O
who O
can O
not O
come O
to O
the O

, O
should O
have O
the O
possibility O
to O
deliver O
his O

" O

The O
Greens B-ORG
emphasize O
another O
practical O
point O
of O
view O
: O

" O
We O
have O
been O
discussing O
the O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
for O
years O
, O
and O
you O
think O
you O
can O
present O
the O
matter O
in O
a O
few O
lines O
on O
the O
questionnaire O
" O
, O
held O
local O
councilor O
Freya B-PER
Linder I-PER
against O
the O
CDU B-ORG
. O

And O
with O
good O
reason O
: O

Because O
already O
when O
it O
was O
about O
the O
first O
zone O
in O
the O
local O
district O
, O
the O
working O
group O
could O
not O
agree O
on O
formulations O
for O
such O
a O
sheet O
. O

Mutually O
one O
accused O
itself O
not O
to O
explain O
neutrally O
and O
to O
want O
to O
manipulate O
the O
inhabitants O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
project O
was O
overturned O
by O
the O
SPD B-ORG
, O
FDP B-ORG
and O
the O
Greens B-ORG
together O
. O

The O
majority O
conditions O
looked O
this O
time O
however O
differently O

Görtz I-PER
( O
FDP B-ORG
) O
, O
tipping O
the O
scales O
, O
voted O
with O
the O
CDU B-ORG

The O
variants O
for O
the O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
are O
easier O
to O
explain O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
than O
the O
three O
variants O
for O
the O
first O
zone O
. O

Moreover O
: O

" O
If O
people O
still O
have O
questions O
, O
they O
can O
come O
to O
the O

" O

The O
SPD B-ORG

the O
motion O

Even O

no O

Hisis B-PER

hopes O
that O
this O
will O
change O

: O

" O
We O
are O
in O
talks O
with O
an O
insurance O
agency O
, O
which O
could O
take O
over O
at O
least O
fifty O
percent O
of O
the O

. O
" O

If O
it O
does O
not O
work O
, O
the O
necessary O
money O
must O
come O
together O

from O

The O

tries O
to O
attract O
spectators O
by O
advertising O

However O
, O
they O
have O
to O
travel O
to O

because O
Borussia B-ORG
plays O
its O
home O

on O
the O

The O

consisting O
of O
a O

of O
17 O

, O
has O
lost O
nothing O
in O

despite O
numerous O

says O

Finally O
, O
one O

from O

. O

And O
the O
enthusiasm O
is O
great O
, O
he O
emphasizes O
. O
" O

Perhaps O
it O
is O
also O
an O
advantage O
that O
we O
are O
the O
only O
Turkish B-MISC
team O
in O
the O

and O
no O
one O

us O

, O
he O
implores O

Although O

Cucak B-PER
: O

" O
There O
are O
numerous O
talented O
players O
who O
have O
come O
here O
from O
the O
war O
zones O
, O
but O
they O
do O
not O
get O
work O
permits O
and O
are O
therefore O
not O
allowed O
to O
play O
. O
" O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
hopes O
that O
the O
team O
, O
according O
to O
the O
motto O
" O
Now O
more O
than O
ever O
" O
will O
make O
a O
good O
start O
to O
the O
season O
. O
" O

Twenty O
years O
ago O
, O
Cucak B-PER
and O
four O
of O
his O
friends O
had O
founded O
FC B-ORG
Tempo I-ORG
. O

The O
idea O
for O
the O
club O
name O
, O
explains O
the O
according O
to O
own O
words O
" O

- O
beside O
his O
activity O
with O
the O

he O
whistles O

plays O
for O
some O
years O
- O
had O
come O
to O
them O
at O
that O
time O
, O
because O
the O
team O
had O
steamed O
successfully O
in O
the O
express O
train O
speed O
by O
the O
preparation O
plays O
. O

And O
until O
today O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
150 O
members O
is O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
a O
national O
club O
name O
is O
unnecessary O
, O
like O
the O
Croatian B-MISC
league O
rival O
Dubrovnik B-ORG
or O
AC B-ORG
Mladost I-ORG
( O
former O
Jugo B-ORG
Bornheim I-ORG
) O
have O
done O
. O

This O
changes O
, O
and O
over O
it O
Cucak B-PER
is O
particularly O
sad O
, O
nothing O
at O
the O
fact O
that O
sponsors O
withdrew O
, O
( O
the O
promised O
promotion O
premium O
could O
not O
be O
paid O
therefore O
) O
, O
the O
club O
from O
tournaments O
again O
was O
disinvited O
and O
the O
four O
youth O
teams O
as O
well O
as O
the O
departments O
, O
table O
tennis O
, O
chess O
, O
skittles O
and O
folklore O
had O
to O
be O
dissolved O
. O

The O
chairman O
therefore O
looks O
forward O
to O
the O
jubilee O
celebration O
planned O
in O
October O
for O
the O
20th O
anniversary O
of O
the O
club O
. O
" O

We O
really O
do O
not O
have O
many O
reasons O
to O
celebrate O
. O
" O

Since O
it O
is O
already O
a O
great O
joy O
that O
the O
players O
may O
continue O
to O
use O
the O
place O
of O
Germania B-ORG
Ginnheim I-ORG
, O
both O
for O
the O
twice O

However O
, O
there O
is O
neither O
an O
intact O

( O
the O
city O
has O
not O
kept O
its O
promises O
, O
according O
to O
Cucak B-PER
) O
, O
nor O
a O
clubhouse O
for O
the O
FC B-ORG
; O
after O
the O
games O
, O
the O
kickers O
meet O
privately O
. O

Efforts O
to O
find O
a O
place O
of O
their O
own O
have O
failed O
so O
far O
: O

a O
problem O
that O
affects O
many O
clubs O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
. O

Therefore O
, O
a O
merger O
with O
the O
cultural O
and O
art O
club O
" O
Vuk B-ORG

" O
is O
planned O

" O
It O
is O
difficult O
to O
run O
this O
association O
, O
especially O
now O
, O
when O
the O
resentment O
is O
openly O
revealed O

sometimes O

" O

then O
we O

If O

we O

the O

reckoned O
with O

" O
The O

changed O
over O

And O
so O
today O
the O

has O
a O
different O
value O
" O
, O
explained O
the O

. O

In O
his O
experience O
, O
the O

are O
more O
outward O

looking O
than O
in O
the O

" O

We O
do O
not O

want O
to O
welcome O
as O
many O

as O
possible O
. O
" O

In O
this O

, O
the O

Shortly O

the O

: O

Finkenhofstraße B-LOC

But O
a O

the O
Lersnerstraße B-LOC
already O
pointed O
out O
the O
next O

About O
two O

Schmid I-PER
, O
the O
German B-MISC
shepherd O
dogs O
used O

until O
they O
master O
all O
this O

But O
even O
the O
best O
training O
and O
the O
greatest O
experience O
is O
sometimes O
not O
much O
use O
, O
because O
the O
animals O
are O
subject O
to O
performance O
fluctuations O
, O
just O
like O
humans O
. O
" O

Especially O
in O
the O
current O
dog O

with O
strongly O
fluctuating O
temperatures O
are O
sometimes O
the O
dogs O
completely O
off O
the O

, O
says O
Müller B-PER

Thus O
some O
animals O
would O
have O
shown O
much O
better O
achievements O
with O
the O
preliminary O
decisions O
. O

For O
the O
dogs O
such O
a O
competition O
brings O
also O
much O
unknown O
with O
itself O
, O
because O
the O
shepherd O
and O
his O
dogs O
do O
not O
know O
the O
herd O
. O

There O
it O
can O
already O
occur O
that O
the O
herd O
becomes O
nervous O
and O
suddenly O
drives O
the O
dogs O
. O

This O
has O
not O
happened O
in O
Kirch B-LOC
- I-LOC
Göns I-LOC
, O
but O
also O
considerable O
achievements O
were O
demanded O
from O
the O
shepherds O
. O

If O
, O
for O
example O
, O
a O
flock O
of O
about O
320 O
sheep O
as O
in O
Kirch B-LOC

Göns I-LOC
on O
a O
road O
just O
over O
three O
meters O
wide O
runs O
, O
it O
pulls O
apart O
on O
a O
stretch O
of O
over O
300 O
meters O
and O
must O
be O
kept O
together O
. O

In O
Kirch B-LOC
- I-LOC
Göns I-LOC
the O
shepherds O
cursed O
about O
the O
strongly O
fallen O
prices O
, O
which O
would O
drive O
them O
into O
the O

. O

In O
addition O
the O

Friedrich B-PER
Schlosser I-PER
: O

" O
Five O

3.50 O

The O
situation O

not O
much O
better O
for O

Were O
it O
years O

still O
nine O
to O
ten O
marks O

, O
so O
there O
are O
now O
only O
between O
five O

six O
marks O

" O

Without O
the O
slaughter O
premiums O
of O
the O
EC B-ORG
, O
many O
shepherds O
would O
be O
broke O

according O
to O
him O

Therefore O

today O
for O

in O
trying O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O

the O
then O
board O

renounced O
the O
water O
rights O
for O
the O

which O
is O

The O
reason O
: O

The O

little O

the O

the O

reason O
for O
the O

the O

about O

or O
the O

Another O
suggestion O
was O

In O
the O

the O
renovation O

would O
be O
started O

said O
Ms O

The O
funds O
for O

will O
in O

be O
made O

The O

will O
negotiate O
now O
with O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Railroad I-ORG
, O
so O
that O
the O
measurements O
can O
give O
as O

as O

council I-ORG
5 I-ORG
( O

on O
its O

The O
noise O
pollution O
on O
the O
southern O
side O
of O
the O
new O
S O
- O
Bahn O
line O
along O
Tiroler B-LOC
Straße I-LOC
has O
decreased O
considerably O
due O
to O
the O
construction O
of O
noise O
barriers O
. O

This O
was O
communicated O
by O
the O
magistrate O
to O
the O
local O
advisory O
council O
in O
a O
report O
recently O
. O

According O
to O
this O
, O
the O
technicians O
measured O
only O
52 O
decibels O
( O
dB O
( O
A O
) O
) O
in O
the O
western O
part O
of O
Tiroler B-LOC
Straße I-LOC
and O
61 O
dB O
( O
A O
) O
were O
measured O
in O
the O
eastern O
part O
. O

Before O
the O
construction O
, O
the O
values O
had O
been O
61.1 O
and O
67 O
dB O
( O
A O
) O
respectively O
. O

At O
Waidmannstrasse B-LOC
the O
noise O
level O
dropped O
by O
more O
than O
6 O
dB O
( O
A O
) O
, O
from O
66.2 O
dB O
( O
A O
) O
to O
60 O
dB O
( O
A O
) O
. O

If O
the O
noise O
level O
is O
reduced O
by O
10 O
dB O
( O
A O
) O
, O
this O
corresponds O
to O
a O
halving O
of O
the O
noise O
. O

According O
to O
the O
CDU B-ORG
, O
the O
report O
of O
the O
Magistrate O
is O
not O
complete O
, O
because O
the O
residents O
north O
of O
the O
tracks O
were O
not O
included O
in O
the O
measurement O
program O
. O
" O

If O
the O
people O
there O
complain O
about O
noise O
, O
then O
measurements O
should O
also O
be O
made O
on O
the O

a O

not O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
renewal O
of O
heating O
systems O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
true O
: O

The O
past O
years O
have O
led O
to O
new O
insights O
and O
serious O
improvements O
in O
heating O
technology O
. O

Who O
uses O
at O

still O
a O
heating O
system O
of O
older O
construction O

, O
should O
let O
himself O
calculate O
from O
an O
expert O
once O
, O
how O
much O
energy O
and O
thus O
money O
he O
can O
save O
with O
a O
new O
, O
up O
- O
to O
- O
date O

. O

If O
the O
boiler O
is O
older O
than O
ten O
years O
, O
one O
can O
assume O
with O
high O
probability O
a O
saving O
potential O
of O
more O
than O
20 O
per O
cent O
. O

If O
one O
adds O
that O
in O
all O
rule O
the O
maintenance O
expenditure O
sinks O
with O
a O
new O
plant O
clearly O
, O
the O
investment O
amortizes O
within O

But O
there O
is O
another O

argument O
: O

On O

1993 O
, O
the O
transitional O

the O

Lower O

In O

with O

so O
. O

The O

a O
completely O

with O
almost O

The O
four O

composed O
in O
1958 O
, O
lasts O
a O
good O
half O
hour O
- O
ten O
minutes O
too O
long O
, O
despite O
many O
interesting O
aspects O
, O
because O
one O
of O
Eben O

compositional O
principles O
is O
the O
repetition O
of O
the O
same O
rhythmic O
and O
melodic O
patterns O
. O

The O
piece O
thus O
loses O
tension O
, O
and O
the O
listener O
becomes O
tired O

But O
the O
organist O
can O
not O
complain O
: O

Petr B-PER

these O
words O

the O

the O
summer O

of O
the O
Greens B-ORG

Bergen B-LOC

Enkheim I-LOC
. O

The O
festival O
site O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
was O
ideal O
: O

at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
forest O
, O
behind O
an O
allotment O
garden O
, O
in O
fresh O
country O
air O
. O

From O
the O
evening O
coolness O
in O
" O

" O
distracted O
however O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
young O
Swiss O
woman O
named O
Rütli B-PER
Polter I-PER
. O

She O
was O
the O
show O
attraction O
of O
the O
evening O
. O
" O

I O
throw O
things O
in O
the O
air O
with O
artistic O
skill O
, O
and O
sometimes O
I O
catch O
them O
again O
" O
, O
she O
announced O
her O
performance O
. O

Rütli B-PER
Polter I-PER
juggled O
with O
a O
diabolo O
, O
clubs O
and O
balls O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
she O
showed O
more O
skill O
in O
throwing O
them O
in O
the O
air O
than O
in O
catching O
them O
again O
. O

This O
had O
two O
reasons O
: O

There O
was O
no O
stage O
, O
but O
plenty O
of O
lanterns O
above O
the O
heads O
of O
audience O
and O
artist O
. O

Both O
prevented O
the O
juggler O
from O
the O
full O
development O
of O
her O
high O
- O
flying O
artistry O
. O

With O
a O
lot O
of O
wit O
and O
charm O
she O
made O
up O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
balls O
and O
clubs O
often O
enough O
did O
not O
land O
in O
her O
hands O
but O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

But O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
: O

The O
audience O
liked O
it O
. O

And O
the O
visitors O
of O
the O
summer O
festival O
had O
earned O
a O
little O
fun O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
Ulrike B-PER
Gieseking I-PER
: O

" O
The O
festival O
is O
held O
for O
the O
second O
time O
. O

It O
is O
also O
meant O
as O
a O
little O
reward O
for O
the O
Greens B-ORG
themselves O
, O
for O
the O
frustration O
. O
" O

Frustration O
there O
is O
especially O
with O
traffic O
problems O
in O
the O
local O
council O
of O

: O

The O
" O

be O
opened O
for O
through O

to O
the O
northeast O

to O
relieve O
the O
small O

The O
Greens B-ORG
think O
this O
makes O
sense O
. O

For O
this O
they O
reap O
the O
displeasure O
of O
the O

owners O
living O
in O
the O

They O
fear O
the O

Nothing O

happened O
. O

If O
someone O
jumped O
into O
the O

so O
far O
, O
then O
out O

Originally O
, O
the O
communities O
of O

baptized O

the O

, O
confirms O
, O
one O
of O
the O

thrown O

The O

, O
which O
had O

" O

" O
with O
old O
tree O
trunks O
, O
had O
not O
withstood O
the O
confrontation O
with O
a O
stone O
, O
had O
leaked O
. O

The O
end O
of O
the O
second O
raft O
came O
surprisingly O
with O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
authority O
staff O
from O
northern B-LOC
Hesse I-LOC

The O
disaster O
became O
apparent O
when O
the O
seven O
- O
meter O
- O
long O
raft O
slowly O
sank O
at O
the O
back O
. O

One O
of O
the O
two O
rafters O
reacted O
according O
to O
regulations O
: O

He O
jumped O
into O
the O
water O
to O
pull O
the O
raft O
with O
a O
rope O
to O
the O
shore O
lying O
about O
three O
meters O
away O
. O

Then O
the O
guests O
could O
have O
come O
ashore O
on O
dry O
feet O
. O

Whether O
they O
panicked O
or O
preferred O
to O
take O
their O
fate O
into O
their O
own O
hands O
is O
unclear O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
certain O
is O
that O
they O
jumped O
into O
the O
about O
one O
meter O
deep O
water O
and O
reached O
the O
saving O
shore O
wading O
. O

The O
thing O
would O
perhaps O
have O
run O
in O
the O
( O
Fulda- B-LOC
) O
sand O
if O
the O
raft O
operators O
had O
still O
been O
able O
to O
show O
an O
operating O
license O
. O

However O
, O
this O

and O
the O

probably O
not O
been O
applied O
for O
in O

For O
the O
Malsfeld B-MISC

everything O
was O
clear O
. O

It O
took O
the O
" O
sloppiness O
" O
on O
the O
grain O

illegal O

painted O
what O
could O

happened O
if O

but O
for O

children O
had O
stood O
on O
the O
raft O
and O
finally O
prophesied O
a O
bitter O
loss O
for O
the O

Meanwhile O
the O
organizers O
of O
the O

trips O
were O
confronted O
according O
to O

with O
substantial O
claims O
for O

new O

or O
also O
replacement O

cameras O

Whether O
they O
want O
to O
repeat O
their O
trip O
, O
which O
virtually O
fell O
into O
the O
water O
, O
is O
not O

, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
Molly B-PER

, O
is O
not O
enough O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
association O
is O
not O
allowed O
to O
use O
the O

or O
the O

Because O
the O

this O

The O

at O
the O

, O
can O
not O

The O
consequence O
: O

One O

must O
be O

Also O
the O

it O
may O
have O

" O
usually O

even O
if O

The O

" O

We O

Most O

are O
not O
caught O
with O
live O
animals O
, O
however O
, O
but O
with O
articles O

: O

or O
the O

: O

The O
excuses O
of O
those O

are O
always O
the O

An O
answer O
that O
Wohlfarth B-PER
does O
not O
accept O
: O

" O
If O
the O
protection O
applies O
to O
an O
animal O
species O
, O
then O
also O
for O
the O
dead O
animals O
. O
" O

The O
turtle O
soup O
is O
just O
as O
protected O
as O
the O
turtle O
itself O
. O

And O
another O
excuse O
: O

The O
ivory O
bracelet O
is O
only O
an O

" O

" O
, O
it O
is O

But O
also O
here O
the O
customs O

remain O
hard O
. O

If O

can O
not O
prove O
that O
the O

was O
shot O
before O

- O
a O
primitive O
confirmation O
of O

by O

sufficient O
- O

The O
consciousness O
that O
animal O
smuggling O
is O
punishable O
, O
says O
Felsing B-PER
, O
is O
today O
in O
the O
population O
quite O

That O

carry O

Wohlfahrt B-PER
also O
sees O
little O
hope O
in O
the O

that O
animal O
smuggling O
could O
disappear O
completely O
: O

" O
The O
kilo O
of O

more O
expensive O
than O
the O

" O

if O

I O

he O

" O

No O

What O
would O
be O
to O

" O

be O

In O

the O

However O
not O

I O
am O
confronted O

the O

Even O
as O
a O
crowning O
of O

he O

to O
be O
had O
. O

Hasek B-PER
would O
probably O
have O
gotten O
drunk O
with O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
bottle O
and O
put O
some O
so O
stupid O
sentences O
into O
Schwejk B-PER
's O
mouth O
that O
they O
would O
have O
immediately O
taken O
away O
any O
advertising O
value O
in O
their O
immeasurable O
accuracy O
. O

Now O
Schwejk B-PER
does O
not O
only O
appear O
to O
me O
as O
a O
kitsch O
figure O
. O

Also O
in O
the O
most O
serious O
publications O
of O
the O
most O
serious O
German B-MISC
publication O
organs O
he O
appears O
again O
and O
again O
in O
order O
to O
characterize O
the O
customs O
in O
my O
host O
country O
plausibly O
. O

Mostly O
he O
is O
mentioned O
together O
with O
a O
certain O
Mr. O
Kafka B-PER
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
had O
a O
somewhat O
different O
world O
view O
and O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
is O
said O
to O
have O
actually O
lived O

Such O
products O
of O

can O
not O
be O
mistaken O

So O
I O
went O
in O
search O
of O
Kafka B-PER

spirit O
and O
the O
Bohemian B-MISC
Schwejks B-PER
. O

I O
met O
people O
who O
in O
their O
joy O
about O
the O
opening O
are O
more O
western O
than O
the O
most O
uncritical O

and O
some O
others O
who O
in O
their O
insecurity O
are O
already O
hanging O
on O
to O
the O
conditions O
they O
thought O
they O
had O
overcome O
. O

People O
who O
understand O
freedom O
as O
fast O
money O
, O
and O
others O
who O
develop O
a O
new O
, O
open O
culture O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
grown O
traditions O
. O

Civil O
servants O
who O
have O
not O
yet O
noticed O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Schranzenherrschaft O
, O
and O
civil O
servants O
who O
ignore O
with O
a O
smile O
the O
confusion O
of O
regulations O
of O
the O
transition O
era O
. O

Sales O
clerks O
who O
still O
treat O
the O
customer O
as O
a O
socialist O
applicant O
, O
and O
sales O
clerks O
who O
, O
with O
never O
- O
ending O
friendliness O
, O
hide O
the O
fact O
that O
closing O

Cab O

steadfastly O
refuse O

along O

the O
customary O

Sometimes O
I O
thought O
from O
afar O
that O
there O
he O
was O
, O
Schwejk B-PER
. O

But O
on O
closer O
inspection O
he O
always O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
person O
like O
you O
and O
me O
. O

Of O
course O
it O
was O
always O
especially O
curious O
when O
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
Bohemian B-MISC
Schwejks B-PER
was O
ascribed O
to O
all O
citizens O
of O
the O
CSFR B-ORG
. O

At O
least O
the O
Slovaks B-MISC
seem O
to O
have O
put O
a O
stop O
to O
this O
in O
the O
meantime O
with O
their O
hardly O
overheard O
demand O
for O
independence O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
this O
has O
created O
a O
sensitive O
gap O
for O
international O
journalism O
. O

But O
there O
is O
a O
remedy O
in O
sight O
. O

There O
was O
a O
Slovak B-MISC
Robin B-PER
Hood I-PER
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
last O
century O
who O
took O
from O
the O
rich O

the O

The O
Hungarian B-MISC
lords O
of O
Slovakia B-LOC
finally O
strung O
him O
up O
. O

Janosik B-PER
was O
the O
name O
of O
the O
folk O
hero O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
know O
that O
the O
Czech B-MISC
saying B-PER
about O
the O
" O
Slovak B-MISC
Janosiks B-PER
" O
is O
not O
very O
popular O
among O
those O
so O
called O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
simplicity O
I O
would O
like O
to O
bring O
it O
into O
the O
conversation O
as O
a O
substitute B-MISC
for I-MISC
Schwejk I-MISC
. O

The O
good O
soldier O
still O
has O
the O
Czech B-MISC
lands O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
Schwejk B-PER
always O
looks O
at O
me O
so O
mischievously O
at O
our O
everyday O
meetings O
now O

" O

You O
see O
, O
" O
his O

says O

" O

ca O

without O
me O
if O
you O
want O
to O
describe O

" O

For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
thought O
about O
how O
I O
could O
stand O
up O
to O
him O
as O
a O
German B-MISC

What O
has O

up O

however O
, O
is O
a O

Such O

Any O

impossible O
, O
because O

was O

an O

The O

taken O
its O

: O

The O

not O

The O
author O
had O
to O
develop O
a O
biographical O
conception O
all O
his O
own O
, O
because O
he O
knew O
exactly O
: O

No O
" O

" O

can O
be O
written O
about O
this O
enigmatic O
and O
fascinating O
figure O
, O
about O
this O
unique O
" O
case O
" O
in O
modern O
intellectual O
history O
. O

Too O
much O
comes O
together O
here O
. O

Althusser B-PER
was O
obviously O
a O
man O
without O
qualities O
, O
but O
as O
a O
philosophy O
professor O
and O
as O
a O
member O
of O
the O
communist O
party O
he O
could O
rise O
to O
an O
intellectual O
myth O
. O

But O
he O
was O
also O
a O
mental O
patient O
whose O
life O
ended O
in O
tragedy O
. O

His O
biographer O
sees O
his O
task O
in O
confronting O
this O
myth O
with O
biographical O
reality O
in O
order O
to O
destroy O
it O
. O

By O
means O
of O
manifold O
new O
sources O
he O
carefully O
tries O
to O
penetrate O
into O
the O
imaginary O
world O
of O
a O
man O
who O
strangled O
his O
wife O
. O

In O
500 O
pages O
he O
traverses O
the O
time O
in O
which O
Althusser B-PER
was O
still O
completely O
unknown O
and O
in O
which O
the O
key O
to O
understanding O
the O
enigma O
must O
lie O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
the O
Algerian B-MISC
childhood O
, O
which O
was O
thoroughly O
poisoned O
by O
an O
anti O
- O
body O
mother O
( O

" O

) O
: O

brilliant O
brother O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
killed O
in O
the O
war O
, O
whom O
she O
was O
supposed O
to O
marry O
! O

So O
already O
the O
child O
was O
forced O
to O
the O
agonizing O
, O
life O
- O
forming O
insight O
to O
have O
no O
own O
existence O
or O
not O
to O
exist O
at O
all O
for O
himself O

an O

Although O
the O

the O

is O
as O

The O

Tskhinvali B-LOC

located O
in O

No O

none O

the O

Now O
they O

the O

Now O
there O

In O

the O

The O
Georgian B-MISC
parliament O
declared O
the O

abolished O
the O

Since O

Among O
many O
Georgians B-MISC

the O

the O

This O

legally O
reprehensible O

but O
from O
the O

it O

According O
to O
reports O

Versluys B-PER
the O
pediatricians O
are O
divided O
opinion O
about O
the O
question O
whether O
the O
killing O
of O
a O
very O
seriously O
damaged O
newborn O
is O
permissible O
. O

In O
the O

" O
To O

" O

would O
therefore O
make O
recommendations O
on O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
these O
differing O
views O
. O

Every O
year O
, O
according O
to O
the O
group O
, O
about O
300 O
newborn O
children O
die O
in O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
because O
the O
doctor O
does O
not O
even O
begin O
medical O
treatment O
or O
discontinues O
treatment O
. O

Versluys B-PER
estimates O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
of O
active O
termination O
of O
life O
in O
newborns O
at O
no O
more O
than O
ten O
per O
year O
. O

The O
recommendations O
state O
that O
parents O
should O
be O
able O
to O
find O
help O
for O
their O
child O
from O
a O
doctor O
who O
understands O
their O
view O
of O
life O
. O

Doctor O
and O
parents O
must O
agree O
on O
what O
is O
to O
be O
done O
with O
the O
child O
. O

This O
could O
mean O
euthanasia O
in O
one O
case O
, O
in O
the O
other O
case O
not O
. O

If O
a O
doctor O
is O
not O
ready O
to O
end O
the O
life O
of O
the O
child O
while O
the O
parents O
wish O
this O
, O
he O
must O
see O
to O
it O
that O
the O
parents O
find O
the O
way O
to O
another O
physician O
who O
fulfills O
their O
wish O
. O

The O
newborns O
to O
whom O
the O
recommendations O
refer O
are O
babies O
no O
more O
than O
four O
weeks O
old O
who O
would O
need O
lifelong O
care O
. O

These O
include O
, O
for O
example O
, O
children O
with O
an O
open O
back O
, O
with O
paralysis O
of O
the O
bladder O
, O
with O
severe O
brain O
damage O
, O
for O
which O
there O
is O
no O
prospect O
of O
a O
life O
of O
sufficient O
quality O
. O

Versluys B-PER
personally O
considers O
it O
acceptable O
to O
actively O
end O
the O
life O
of O
such O
babies O
if O
the O
parents O
also O
wished O
to O
do O
so O
. O

In O
the O
report O
of O
the O
group O
of O
specialists O
are O
set O
criteria O
that O
are O
considered O
to O
determine O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
: O

Can O
the O
child O
later O
think O
for O
itself O
and O
communicate O
? O

Can O
it O
take O
care O
of O
itself O
to O
some O
extent O
, O
can O
it O
be O
taken O
care O
of O
at O
home O
or O
is O
it O
dependent O
on O
medical O
care O
for O
life O
? O

Will O
it O
suffer O
insistently O
? O

And O
: O

How O
long O
will O
it O
live O
? O

Versluys B-PER
advocates O
that O
the O
pediatrician O
who O
actively O
ended O
the O
life O
of O
a O
severely O
damaged O
baby O
should O
report O
it O
to O
the O
public O
prosecutor O
. O

However O
, O
he O
regrets O
that O
there O
are O
no O
legal O
rules O
on O
the O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
judiciary O
considers O
and O
accepts O
active O
termination O
of O
life O
as O
an O
emergency O
. O

The O
working O
group O
considers O
that O
in O
the O
given O
circumstances O
the O
doctor O
must O
decide O
for O
himself O
whether O
he O
considers O
it O
appropriate O
to O
inform O
the O
public O
prosecutor O
about O
his O
actions O
or O
not O
. O

A O
judicial O
inquiry O
, O
they O
say O
, O
could O
cause O
great O
unrest O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
put O
the O

severe O
pressure O
. O

us O
an O

what O
the O

In O
1931 O
the O

was O
ostracized O

In O

it O
is O
no O

If O
the O
Federal O
Court O
of O

would O
decide O
differently O
than O
the O
Berlin B-ORG
Court I-ORG
of O
Appeal O
, O
then O
the O
whole O
system O

would O
have O
to O
doubt O
itself O

Many O

think O
that O
then O
our O

It O
is O

that O

the O

Would O

Oh O
, O
let O
us O
scare O
away O
these O
thoughts O
, O
the O
German B-MISC
justice O
will O
not O
change O
by O
the O
case O
Ossietzky B-PER
, O
but O
the O
decision O
in O
the O
case O
Ossietzky B-PER
is O
a O
preliminary O
decision O
in O
the O
case O
Honecker B-PER
. O

If O
in O
1931 O
international O
law O
did O
not O
apply O
, O
why O
should O
it O
have O
applied O
in O

why O

today O

If O
Ossietzky B-PER
remains O
a O
traitor O
even O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG

, O
then O
Honecker B-PER
is O

This O

( O
FR B-ORG
of O

" O

. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
German B-MISC
press O
has O
reported O
mainly O
on O
the O
closed O
cities O
of O
Sarajevo B-LOC
and O
Gorazde B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
not O
obvious O
how O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
people O
in O
these O
cities O
could O
be O
improved O
by O
armed O
aid O
convoys O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
everything O
possible O
must O
be O
done O
to O
save O
the O
lives O
of O
the O
defenseless O
, O
i.e. O
women O
, O
children O
, O
the O
elderly O
, O
the O
wounded O
. O

It O
makes O
no O
sense O
to O
bring O
food O
to O
these O
people O
and O
then O
leave O
them O
behind O
in O
the O
hail O
of O
bullets O
, O
while O
you O
yourself O
drive O
back O
to O
the O
safe O
shelter O
. O

How O
should O
such O
an O
action O
be O
handled O
at O
all O
? O

An O
aid O
convoy O
approaches O
the O
city O
of O
Gorazde B-LOC
, O
for O
example O
, O
while O
it O
is O
exposed O
to O
a O
heavy O
artillery O
fire O
. O

Should O
the O
besiegers O
stop O
firing O
until O
the O
food O
is O
delivered O
or O
should O
the O
convoy O
wait O
until O
the O
shelling O
ends O
? O

Both O
seems O
unrealistic O
. O

There O
is O
therefore O
only O
one O
possibility O
to O
provide O
humanitarian O
aid O
. O

All O
those O
unfit O
for O
military O
service O
must O
be O
granted O
free O
departure O
to O
a O
place O
of O
safety O
. O

Everything O
else O
is O
no O
help O
. O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
question O
arises O
whether O
the O
Bosnians B-MISC
want O
the O
free O
withdrawal O
of O
women O
and O
children O
at O
all O
. O

Possibly O
they O
reject O
it O
because O
it O
could O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
renunciation O
of O
the O
land O
claimed O
by O
them O
. O

It O
would O
be O
grateful O
if O
you O
would O
report O
on O
this O
. O

The O
Bosnians B-MISC
will O
also O
wonder O
who O
will O
feed O
the O
soldiers O
when O
the O
women O
and O
children O
are O
no O
longer O
there O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
clear O
that O
humanitarian O
aid O
only O
for O
civilians O
does O
not O
exist O
at O
all O
. O

The O
soldiers O
will O
always O
make O
sure O
that O
something O
is O
left O
over O
for O
them O
as O
well O
, O
probably O
even O
the O
larger O
share O
. O

Thus O
the O
supply O
of O
food O
is O
a O
support O
for O
a O
belligerent O
party O
. O

It O
is O
hardly O
to O
be O
expected O
that O
the O
Serbs B-MISC
will O
accept O
this O
. O

We O
can O
only O
help O
the O
Bosnians B-MISC
by O
proposing O
to O
them O
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O
Serbs B-MISC
a O
treaty O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
the O
civilians O
in O
the O
disputed O
areas O
will O
be O
granted O
free O
and O
safe O
departure O
to O
a O
place O
of O
safety O
. O

There O
are O
no O
other O
options O
. O

Interference O
in O
the O
military O
conflict O
would O
be O
irresponsible O
. O

India B-LOC

China B-LOC
, O
Romania B-LOC
, O
Zimbabwe B-LOC
are O
more O
or O
less O
openly O
taking O
sides O
with O
the O
Serbs B-MISC
. O

Probably O
there O
are O
other O
allies O
. O

A O
confrontation O
with O
these O
states O
would O
lead O
to O
unforeseeable O
consequences O
. O

And O
these O
allies O
are O
also O
right O
. O

There O
are O
in O
the O

200 O

more O
than O
1000 O

The O

would O
be O
in O

Our O

We O

if O

and O
we O
can O

of O

, O
divorces O
are O
comparable O
to O
the O
decisions O

a O
soccer O
referee O
who O
has O
not O
seen O
the O
game O
but O
nevertheless O
decides O
on O
the O
result O
. O

This O
leads O
to O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
catastrophic O
consequences O
, O
because O
who O
is O
supposed O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
livelihood O
of O
an O
ex O
- O
partner O
for O
years O
or O
possibly O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O
without O
his O
own O
fault O
, O
just O
because O
he O
is O
the O
" O
economically O
stronger O
one O
" O
, O
just O
freaks O
out O
many O
times O
. O

In O
order O
to O
relieve O
the O
legislator O
and O
the O
family O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
responsibility O
for O
these O
consequences O
, O
the O
mediators O
are O
to O
hold O
out O
now O
. O

But O
if O
it O
is O
already O
clear O
before O
a O
couple O
seeks O
help O
from O
a O
mediator O
that O
the O
children O
will O
remain O
with O
the O
mother O
regardless O
of O
the O
question O
of O
guilt O
and O
that O
the O
" O
economically O
stronger O
" O
one O
( O
usually O
still O
the O
man O
who O
earns O
more O
or O
alone O
) O
has O
to O
pay O
not O
only O
the O
self O
- O
evident O
child O
support O
but O
also O
postmarital O
support O
to O
an O
ex O
- O
wife O
who O
is O
possibly O
only O
on O
an O
ego O
trip O
, O
then O
the O
use O
of O
mediators O
is O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
shift O
of O
responsibility O
from O
the O
family O
court O
to O
the O

The O
mediation O
aims O
then O
nothing O
else O
than O
a O
Bequatschen O
of O
the O
" O
economically O

" O
to O
accept O
the O
often O

of O
the O

If O
, O
however O
, O
a O

then O
this O
is O

, O
says O
Alimov B-PER

However O
, O
these O

only O

had O
fallen O

Thanks O

Alimov B-PER

he O
was O

an O
Armenian B-MISC
officer O

" O

But O
it O
did O
not O
work O
out O

As O
Alimov B-PER
found O
out O
, O
the O
Armenian B-MISC
officer O

with O
an O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
family O

who O
is O
holding O
him O
captive O
in O
order O
to O
organize O
an O
exchange O
for O
their O
own O

in O

Since O
the O

in O

is O
being O
held O
by O
an O
Armenian B-MISC

, O
which O
thereby O
wants O
to O
free O
its O
own O
son O
from O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
captivity O
, O
the O
enterprise O
failed O
. O

" O
Our O

this O
, O
the O

are O
to O
receive O

This O

Dr. O

From O
view O
of O
the O
Hanauer B-MISC
mayor O
Hans B-PER
Martin I-PER
is O
it O
" O
high O
time O
" O
for O
a O
" O
local O

" O
. O

He O
agrees O
with O
the O
compromise O
proposal O
of O
the O
German B-ORG
Association I-ORG
of O
Cities O
and O
Towns O
to O
give O
the O
municipalities O
a O
share O
of O
the O
sales O
tax O
revenue O
in O
the O
form O
of O
an O
economy O
- O
related O
key O
based O
on O
jobs O
, O
if O
the O
trade O
tax O
is O
to O
be O
reduced O
. O

Such O
a O
regulation O
would O
also O
take O
into O
account O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
industrial O
cities O
, O
says O
Martin B-PER
. O

It O
is O
fair O
and O
corresponds O
to O
the O
financial O
need O
to O
use O
the O
number O
of O
jobs O
or O
the O
wage O
total O
and O
the O
invested O
trade O
capital O
as O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
tax O
distribution O
. O

Thus O
cities O
like O
Hanau B-LOC
with O
numerous O
jobs O
would O
receive O
an O
appropriate O
compensation O
for O
their O
additional O
financial O
burdens O

On O

Gergiev B-PER
goes O
his O

much O
more O

Abbado B-PER

avoids O
) O
, O
bends O
the O
musical O

into O
an O
often O
chamber O
music O
style O

He O
can O
afford O
the O
renunciation O
of O
any O
theatricality O

because O
his O
choirs O
impress O
with O
a O
fantastic O
fine O

convinces O

the O

The O
renunciation O
of O
spectacular O

is O
also O
noticeable O
in O

sound O
technique O
of O
the O

Everything O

even O

up O

some O

are O
clearly O

At O
the O
age O
of O
six O
, O
Hugo B-PER
had O
run O
away O
from O
home O
, O
abandoned O
his O
mother O

grandparents O
and O
other O
relatives O
. O

He O
never O
knew O
his O
father O
. O

Unemployment O
and O
money O
problems O
had O
led O
to O
alcoholism O
and O
constant O
quarrels O
in O
the O
family O
. O

There O
was O
no O
support O
for O
him O
. O

Hugo B-PER
felt O
only O
as O
an O
obstacle O
for O
the O
others O
. O

For O
three O
years O
he O
then O
moved O
in O
gangs O
of O
street O
children O
through O
the O
Colombian B-MISC
capital O
. O

They O
sang O
songs O
in O
buses O
to O
get O
money O
. O

If O
that O
was O
not O
enough O
, O
they O
struggled O
through O
life O
by O
begging O
or O
stealing O
. O

Today O
Hugo B-PER

19 O

Twenty O
years O

, O
the O
Italian B-MISC
Salesian O
Father O
Xavier B-PER

Nicoló I-PER
had O
founded O
this O

- O
following O
the O

of O
his O
religious O

who O
had O
taken O

the O
last O
century O

" O
The O
program O
aims O
firstly O
to O
humanize O
the O
problem O
of O
street O
children O
, O
and O
secondly O
to O
provide O
those O
affected O
with O
a O
comprehensive O
alternative O
to O
their O
current O

Carlos B-PER

, O
a O
pedagogical O
assistant O
at O

" O
, O
adding O
: O

" O
This O
will O
take O
into O
account O
the O
positive O
qualities O
of O
the O
children O
, O
such O
as O
their O
ability O
to O
work O
together O
and O
their O
group O
solidarity O
, O
which O
they O
learned O
on O
the O
street O
. O
" O

Carlos B-PER
has O
been O
through O
the O
four O
stages O
of O
the O
project O
, O
the O
last O
of O
which O
is O
the O
Children O
's O
Republic O
, O
himself O
once O
. O

The O
first O
stage O
is O
called O
" O
Friendship O
" O
. O

Father O
Nicoló B-PER
and O
his O
staff O
go O
to O
the O
children O
, O
called O
" O
gamines O
" O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
streets O
to O
make O
friends O
with O
them O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
the O
program O
adapts O
to O
the O
world O
of O
the O
street O
children O
and O
not O
vice O
versa O
. O

At O
first O
they O
observe O
the O
children O
. O

After O
the O
first O
contacts O
, O
they O
eventually O
begin O
to O
play O
with O
each O
other O
. O

To O
do O
this O
, O
the O
Bosconia B-MISC
educators O
have O
learned O
the O
gamines O
' O
own O
language O
, O
which O
they O
speak O
in O
order O
to O
better O
protect O
themselves O
against O
others O
on O
the O
street O
. O

Afterwards O
they O
invite O
the O
children O
to O
a O
trip O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
, O
south O
of O
Bogotá B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
children O
relax O
by O
swimming O
and O
playing O
and O
live O
for O
a O
while O
without O
drugs O
. O

About O
90 O
percent O
of O
the O
approximately O
5000 O
street O
children O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
turn O
to O
drugs O
. O

Many O
sniff O
cobbler O
glue O
, O
with O
which O
they O
numb O
their O
nerves O
and O
hunger O
. O

Increasingly O
, O
however O
, O
they O
also O
take O
" O
basuco O
" O
, O
a O
particularly O
dangerous O
mixture O
of O
the O
waste O
product O
of O
the O
coca O
plant O
, O
which O
is O
enriched O
with O
chemical O
additives O
. O

The O
trip O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
offers O
the O
staff O
of O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
above O
all O
the O
opportunity O
to O
learn O
about O
the O
background O
of O
the O
street O
life O
of O
the O
children O
. O

All O
those O
responsible O
for O
the O
project O
agree O
that O
, O
like O
many O
other O
problems O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
, O
the O
" O
gamines O
" O
have O
their O
main O
cause O
in O
the O
social O
hardship O
of O
many O
families O
. O

According O
to O
information O
from O
the O
national O
statistics B-ORG
office I-ORG
in O
1990 O
, O
38 O
percent O
of O
all O
Colombian B-MISC
households O
did O
not O
have O
sufficient O
income O
to O
support O
themselves O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
families O
have O
fled O
from O
the O
countryside O
to O
the O
cities O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
educational O
prospects O
and O
medical O
care O
in O
rural O
areas O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
lack O
of O
land O
and O
wages O
to O
live O
on O
, O
are O
driving O
people O
there O
, O
but O
above O
all O
the O
continuing O
" O

" O
( O
violence O
) O
that O
still O
prevails O
there O
: O

Although O
the O
attacks O
of O
the O
drug O
mafia O
have O
decreased O
after O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
military O
arm O
of O
the O
Medellìn B-ORG
cartel I-ORG
last O
year O
, O
aggression O
between O
the O
military O
and O
the O
rebels O
is O
currently O
on O
the O
rise O
again O
after O
unsuccessful O
negotiations O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
guerrillas O
. O

Many O
civilians O
are O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

In O
the O
city O
, O
however O
, O
the O
families O
who O
have O
fled O
often O
find O
no O
work O
or O
only O
employment O
in O
the O
" O
informal O
sector O
" O
, O
that O
is O
, O
they O
have O
no O
regular O
income O
. O

In O
Bogotá B-LOC
, O
more O
than O
440,000 O
workers O
, O
about O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
working O
population O
, O
earn O
less O
than O
the O
already O
very O
low O
minimum O
wage O
, O
according O
to O
government O
economic O
data O
. O

Often O
, O
therefore O
, O
both O
parents O
have O
to O
work O
. O

The O
children O
either O
stay O
at O
home O
alone O
or O
go O
to O
the O
streets O
, O
where O
they O
contribute O
their O
own O
part O
to O
the O
family O
income O
by O
doing O
odd O
jobs O
, O
begging O
or O
stealing O
. O

Often O
they O
then O
join O
the O
street O
children O
and O
break O
off O
contact O
with O
the O
family O
because O
they O
feel O
exploited O
there O
and O
are O
often O
mistreated O
. O
" O

Eighty O
- O
five O
percent O
of O
the O

punish O
their O
children O
, O
" O
explains O
Manuel B-PER
Ospina I-PER
, O
who O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
street O
boys O
in O
Bosconia B-MISC
. O
In O
addition O
to O
social O
hardship O
, O
which O
leads O
to O
frustration O
and O
aggression O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
fathers O
, O
Ospina O
blames O
this O
behavior O
on O
an O
authoritarian O
style O
of O
upbringing O
that O
has O
its O
roots O
in O
the O
long O
history O
of O
exploitation O
and O
slavery O
in O
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
. O

About O
three O
- O
quarters O
of O
the O
street O
children O
who O
take O
part O
in O
the O
trip O
to O
Arvelaez O
then O
come O
regularly O
to O
the O
" O
patio O
" O
, O
a O
courtyard O
that O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
set O
up O
twelve O
years O
ago O
for O
the O
street O
boys O
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
gate O
of O
the O
courtyard O
, O
the O
" O
gamines O
" O
hand O
in O
their O
drugs O
and O
are O
then O
given O
something O
to O
eat O
. O

They O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
wash O
themselves O
, O
play O
soccer O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
get O
medical O
attention O
. O
" O

For O
eight O
days O
, O
I O
have O
been O
coming O
to O
the O
, O
patio O
' O
because O
here O
we O
have O
breakfast O
and O
lunch O
" O
, O
says O
13 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Julian B-PER
. O

He O
also O
became O
a O
street O
boy O
because O
he O
was O
beaten O
up O
by O
his O
parents O
in O
the O
poor O
district O
of O
" O
Santa B-LOC
Librada I-LOC
" O
in O
the O
south O
of O
Bogotá B-LOC
. O

But O
like O
many O
others O
, O
Julian B-PER
is O
drawn O
back O
to O
the O
streets O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
" O
gamines O
" O
have O
become O
accustomed O
to O
the O
" O
free O
life O
" O
there O
. O

This O
will O
for O
freedom O
is O
respected O
by O
the O
staff O
of O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
, O
because O
in O
the O
open O
institution O
they O
want O
to O
take O
the O
dignity O
of O
the O
children O
seriously O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
second O
stage O
of O
the O
program O
, O
which O
is O
called O
" O
freedom O
" O
, O
the O
children O
can O
leave O
. O

But O
here O
they O
have O
to O
abide O
by O
very O
specific O
rules O
, O
such O
as O
being O
there O
to O
eat O
and O
sleep O
, O
and O
to O
have O
conversations O
with O
the O
people O
in O
charge O
. O

Like O
the O
project O
staff O
during O
the O
first O
approaches O
with O
the O
children O
on O
the O
street O
, O
they O
first O
try O
to O
return O
the O
children O
to O
their O
families O
. O

Carlos B-PER
Lara I-PER
and O
Manuel B-PER
Ospina I-PER
are O
convinced O
that O
" O
the O
best O
institution O
is O
the O
real O
family O
. O

However O
, O
their O
experience O
is O
that O
the O
children O
usually O
return O
there O
only O
for O
a O
short O
time O
, O
then O
they O
return O
to O
the O
" O
patio O
" O
. O

They O
start O
all O
over O
again O
, O
which O
those O
who O
have O
once O
left O
must O
do O
for O
educational O
reasons O
. O
" O

Usually O
, O
a O
child O
leaves O
the O
program O
three O
times O
until O
he O
really O
knows O
this O
" O
, O
Carlos B-PER
points O
out O
again O
that O
the O
" O
gamines O
" O
have O
learned O
to O
appreciate O
the O
freedom O
on O
the O
street O
. O

In O
the O
third O
stage O
, O
called O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
, O
" O
the O
children O
finally O
draw O
a O
line O
under O
their O
past O
. O

As O
a O
symbolic O
gesture O
, O
they O
ceremoniously O
burn O
their O
rag O
clothes O
. O

Father O
Nicoló B-PER
sees O
this O
stage O
as O
a O
playful O
introduction O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
. O

Now O
the O
children O
go O
to O
school O
regularly O
and O
learn O
handicrafts O
in O
a O
workshop O
and O
in O
ceramics O
classes O
. O

When O
the O
caretakers O
finally O
feel O
that O
a O
child O
has O
matured O
, O
he O
or O
she O
moves O
to O
the O
children O
's O
republic O
" O
La B-LOC
Florida I-LOC
" O
, O
where O
355 O
young O
people O
currently O
live O
, O
study O
and O
work O
. O

While O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
first O
stages O
of O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
's O
program O
are O
located O
in O
the O

where O
most O
of O

" O

" O
is O
located O
in O
a O
quiet O
, O
green O
countryside O
outside O
the O
city O
. O
" O

Thus O
, O
the O
environment O
contributes O
to O
the O
education O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
the O
hectic O
life O
in O
the O
dirty O

they O
can O
prepare O

the O

Manuel B-PER

the O

him O
most O
about O

But O
the O
majority O
of O
the O

The O

to O
the O
fact O
that O

Flashback O
: O

On O
Friday O
, O
September O
5 O
, O
1986 O
, O
District O
Administrator O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
and O
his O
deputy O
Pipa B-PER
took O
a O
deep O
breath O
in O
the O
Schloßberghalle B-LOC
Nidderau I-LOC
. O

They O
had O
been O
elected O
to O
the O
leading O
positions O
in O
the O
district O
administration O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
Green B-MISC
faction I-MISC
. O

The O
past O
main O
officials O
of O
CDU B-ORG
and O
FDP B-ORG
had O
to O
clear O
their O
armchairs O
. O

Red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
blooming O
dreams O
of O
that O
time O
have O
burst O
in O
the O
meantime O
. O

The O
last O
" O
feat O
" O
: O

After O
tough O
negotiations O
, O
the O
SPD B-ORG
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
, O
was O
able O
to O
pass O
the O
1992 O
- O
93 O
budget O
last O
year O
. O

Then O
the O
SPD B-ORG
stumbled O
into O
a O
voting O
disaster O
in O
the O
county O
council O
on O
the O
landfill O
issue O
. O

Even O
if O
not O
wanted O
, O
so O
the O
NPD B-ORG
as O
brown O
tongues O
at O
the O
balance O
became O
at O
once O
hopeful O
. O

The O
sharper O
course O
of O
district O
administrator O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
and O
his O
deputy O
Pipa B-PER
in O
the O
asylum O
question O
documents O
that O
there O
is O
also O
with O
this O
topic O
no O
more O
consensus O
between O
SPD B-ORG
and O
Greens B-ORG
in O
the O
circle O
. O

While O
the O
two O
main O
officials O
openly O
accuse O
the O
state O
of O
failure O
because O
of O
the O
conditions O
in O
the O
Coleman B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
in O
Gelnhausen O
, O
which O
have O
been O
converted O
into O
refugee O
accommodation O
, O
and O
send O
back O
buses O
with O
asylum O
seekers O
( O
the O
FR B-ORG
reported O
) O
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
find O
it O
" O
terrible O
and O
reprehensible O
when O
asylum O
debates O
take O
on O
a O
vote O
- O
catching O
character O
" O
. O

That O
buses O
with O
refugees O
are O
sent O
back O
by O
the O
Main O
- O
Kinzig B-LOC
district I-LOC
is O
not O
an O
isolated O
case O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
1986 O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
, O
at O
that O
time O
still O
head O
of O
the O
SPD B-MISC
parliamentary I-MISC
group O
in O
the O
Main O
- O
Kinzig B-ORG
parliament I-ORG
, O
denounced O
that O
the O
CDU B-MISC
- I-MISC
led I-MISC
district O
had O
refused O
to O
take O
in O
a O
group O
of O
asylum O
seekers O
. O

In O
a O
current O
hour O
this O
was O
called O
by O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
as O
" O
no O
serious O
way O
of O
acting O
" O
. O

The O
asylum O
seekers O
had O
appeared O
" O
at O
best O
as O
flotsam O
and O
jetsam O
" O
, O
the O
current O
district O
administrator O
explained O
at O
the O
time O
. O

If O
the O
SPD B-ORG
wants O
to O
have O
Erich B-PER
Pipa I-PER
re O
- O
elected O
as O
first O
district O
councillor O
next O
Friday O
in O
the O
same O
Schloßberghalle B-LOC
, O
it O
will O
need O
two O
additional O
votes O
from O
another O
camp O
in O
addition O
to O
its O
own O
. O

The O
Greens B-ORG
already O
let O
through O
to O
carry O
Pipa B-PER
in O
the O
secret O
ballot O
not O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
CDU B-ORG
has O
countered O
speculation O
that O
there O
are O
allegedly O
" O
submarines O
" O
in O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
CDU O
/ O
CSU O
who O
would O
have O
sided O
with O
the O
first O
district O
councillor O
. O

Pipa B-PER
wants O
according O
to O
his O
own O
statements O
" O
in O
no O
case O
to O
be O
elected O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
neo B-MISC
- I-MISC
Nazis I-MISC
" O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
he O
considers O
it O
necessary O
that O
the O
position O
of O
the O
First O
District O
Councillor O
should O
not O
remain O
vacant O
for O
months O
. O

Pipa B-PER
, O
who O
already O
sometimes O
uses O
abstractions O
against O
journalists O
who O
have O
fallen O
out O
of O
favor O
, O
appeals O
to O
the O
members O
of O
the O
county O
council O
not O
to O
shirk O
their O
responsibility O
. O

Thus O
he O
expressed O
already O
publicly O
that O
" O
another O

must O
ran O
, O
if O
one O
does O
not O

The O

dioxins O

100 O

of O
the O

for O

of O

. O

The O

was O
identified O
by O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Trade O
Inspectorate O
as O
one O
of O
the O
sources O
of O
pollution O
. O

According O
to O
Neidhardt B-PER
this O
corresponds O
to O
one O
eighth O
of O
the O
total O
load O
. O

The O
other O

are O

unknown O
. O

Morlocks B-PER
thesis O
contradicts O
the O
BUND B-MISC
scientist I-MISC
Rolf B-PER
Neidhardt I-PER
decidedly O
. O

Dioxin O
exists O
in O
the O
ecosystem O
only O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
chlorine O
chemistry O
. O

In O
crude O
oil O
, O
coal O
or O
also O
in O
mummified O
, O
centuries O
- O
old O
Eskimo O
corpses O
no O
traces O
of O
dioxin O
had O
been O
discovered O
. O

Scientific O
investigations O
with O
wood O
burnings O
had O
shown O
besides O
only O
high O
dioxin O
concentrations O
, O
if O
for O
example O
PVC O
was O
added O
. O

According O
to O
Neidhardt B-PER
, O
the O
dioxin O
concentration O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O
so O
dramatically O
in O
recent O
years O
that O
the O
federal O
government O
publicly O
considers O
remedial O
action O
necessary O
and O
advocates O
the O
closure O
of O
unnecessary O
sources O
. O

BUND B-ORG
considers O
the O
municipal O
crematorium O
to O
be O
such O
a O
source O
and O
opposes O
the O
cremation O
of O
people O
in O
whose O
fatty O
tissue O
dioxin O
is O
concentrated O
. O

Gerhard B-PER
Morlock I-PER
does O
not O
contradict O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
dioxin O
concentration O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O
. O

However O
, O
he O
considers O
the O
installation O
of O
, O
for O
example O
, O
an O
electrostatic O
precipitator O
in O
the O
plant O
sufficient O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
limit O
value O
. O
" O

The O
little O
bit O
of O
waste O
gas O
from O
the O
crematorium O
I O
consider O
insignificant O
" O
, O
Morlock B-PER
said O
. O

He O
sees O
the O
" O
huge O
amounts O
of O
flue O
gas O
from O
the O
Staudinger B-LOC
power O
plant O
" O
as O
a O
possibly O
much O
greater O
source O
of O
pollution O
. O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
measurements O
should O
be O
taken O
there O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
per O
cubic O
meter O
of O
exhaust O
air O
will O
probably O
hardly O
be O
measurable O
, O
the O
enormous O
amount O
would O
contribute O
to O
the O
pollution O
. O

" O

Yet O
there O
are O
many O
different O
types O
of O

" O

For O
him O
, O
addiction O
is O
closely O
linked O
to O
the O
shaping O
of O
the O
personality O
, O
and O
this O
is O
precisely O
where O
the O
trained O
teachers O
should O
start O
. O

In O
elementary O
school O
, O
they O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
steer O
their O
personality O
development O
in O
a O
positive O
direction O
because O
of O
the O
relatively O
close O
contact O
with O
the O
students O
. O

The O
children O
must O
learn O
to O
say O
" O
no O
" O
sometimes O
, O
and O
they O
should O
develop O
the O
ability O
to O
form O
real O
social O
relationships O
. O
" O

The O
earlier O

the O
easier O
it O
is O

himself O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
the O

not O

Mayor O
Wilfried B-PER

In O

the O

That O
means O
an O
indirect O

, O
explains O
the O
mayor O
, O
because O
the O

no O

That O

after O

Beyond O
that O
Martin B-PER
is O
not O
however O
so O
quite O
enthusiastically O
from O
the O
emergency O
decree O
. O

Since O
as O
reported O
lawns O
may O
not O
be O
blown O
up O
, O
he O
fears O
large O
damage O
to O
the O
sports O
facilities O
. O

Therefore O
he O
has O
applied O
for O
an O
exemption O
at O
the O
district O
president O
. O

The O
sports O
facilities O
are O
in O
the O
meantime O
in O
such O
a O
way O
put O
on O
that O
they O
can O
be O
played O
also O
after O
rainfalls O
, O
and O
well O
drained O
. O

They O
dry O
out O
therefore O
very O
fast O
, O
if O
they O
are O
not O
regularly O
sprinkled O
, O
Martin B-PER
gives O
to O
consider O
. O

If O
the O
sports O
facilities O
were O
not O
sprinkled O
, O
damages O
for O
the O
municipality O
of O
about O
50,000 O
marks O
per O
field O
were O
to O
be O
feared O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
the O
rain O
has O
come O
to O
the O
aid O
of O
the O
hard O
- O
pressed O
municipalities O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
drought O
problem O
is O
likely O
to O
lead O
to O
a O
fundamental O
debate O
about O
the O
construction O
of O

Rolf B-PER
Gnadl I-PER

the O
mayor O
sees O
the O

also O
not O

dramatically O
as O

Then O

the O

It O
gives O

even O
if O
this O

because O
they O

Mr. O

Lüders B-PER

Mr. O
Steiner B-PER
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
ask O
again O
. O

In O
the O
occupied O
territories O
- O
you O
call O
them O
the O
liberated O
territories O
- O
live O
almost O
two O
million O
Palestinians B-MISC
who O
demonstrably O
do O
not O
want O
to O
live O
under O
Israeli B-MISC
rule O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
political O
perspective O
do O
you O
have O
to O
offer O
these O
people O
? O

Steiner B-PER
: O

It O
is O
quite O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
the O
Palestinians B-MISC
will O
not O
accept O
anything O
other O
than O
complete O
political O
autonomy O
, O
which O
in O
the O
final O
analysis O
will O
lead O
to O
a O
Palestinian B-LOC
state I-LOC

If O
Mr. O
Virshubski B-PER
wants O
to O
explain O
to O
us O
here O
that O
the O
death O
of O
so O
many O
people O
hurts O
him O

well O
, O
it O
hurts O
us O
all O

As O
long O

there O
was O
no O
Intifada B-MISC
, O
the O
people O
there O
lived O
very O
well O
and O
normally O
, O
economically O
they O
developed O
splendidly O

they O
did O
good O
business O

But O
when O
the O
PLO B-ORG

there O
was O
a O

and O
unfortunately O

there O

Lüders B-PER

I O
will O
leave O
your O
interpretation O
of O
the O
Intifada B-MISC

side O

Once O

: O

What O
kind O
of O
political O
model O
do O
you O
have O
to O
offer O
the O
Palestinians B-MISC
? O

Steiner B-PER
: O

Quite O
simple O

To O
be O
a O
good O
citizen O
. O

We O
Jews B-MISC
were O
also O
minorities O
in O
many O
countries O
for O

Lüders B-PER
: O

Does O
that O

, O
you O
would O

In O
the O

half O

there O
was O
a O
similar O
conflict O
over O
the O
appointment O
of O

of O
the O
ZDF B-ORG

as O
is O
currently O

over O

Here O

too O
, O
the O

have O
refused O
to O
nominate O
more O

although O
the O
minister O

had O
even O
expressly O
asked O
for O
the O

the O

In O
March O
, O
the O
heads O
of O

of O
the O

had O
determined O
that O

They O
had O
then O
asked O

to O
include O

the O

The O
response O
was O
sobering O
: O

The O

declined O
and O
also O
expressly O
requested O
that O
the O
number O
one O
of O
their O
three O
proposals O
be O
appointed O

The O
DGB B-ORG
claimed O
that O

that O

For O
the O
exhibition O

last O

city I-LOC

Verdonk B-PER

only O
part O

: O

" O
When O
I O
take O
ghost O
figures O

I O
select O
before O

so O
that O
the O

It O
is O
not O
always O
so O
" O
that O
every O

" O
, O
the O
artists O
do O
not O
always O
have O
professional O
tools O
available O
to O
carve O
perfect O
works O
. O

But O
maybe O
that O
is O
what O
makes O
the O
art O
of O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
. O

Most O
sculptures O
are O
made O
by O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
in O
a O
state O
of O
fear O
. O

Fear O
is O
the O
constant O
companion O
of O
this O
people O
, O
who O
, O
according O
to O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
, O
live O
in O
a O
completely O
different O
world O
, O
unimaginable O
for O
Europeans B-MISC
. O

For O
them O
, O
a O
dream O
is O
reality O
, O
which O
is O
represented O
in O
their O
works O
: O

" O
When O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
dream O
that O
their O
ancestors O
are O
angry O
with O
them O
because O
no O
one O
thinks O
of O
them O
anymore O
, O
they O
get O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
start O
carving O
the O
contours O
of O
their O
great O
- O
grandmother O
. O

Their O
bad O
conscience O
is O
so O
often O
the O
starting O
point O
of O
the O
work O
. O

The O
Makonde B-MISC
also O
feel O
constantly O
surrounded O
by O
demons O
, O
in O
the O
Swahili B-MISC
language I-MISC
" O
Shetani O
" O
. O

Of O
the O
" O
Shetani O
" O
there O
is O
a O
rich O
variety O
. O

They O
are O
mostly O
mixed O
creatures O
of O
man O
and O
animal O
, O
voracious O
, O
mischievous O
and O
hiding O
. O

But O
not O
all O
spirits O
consider O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
dangerous O
: O

" O
The O
good O
spirits O
can O
be O
recognized O
by O
the O
gentle O
and O
large O
eye O
" O
, O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
knows O
. O

Sculptors O
are O
also O
concerned O
with O
eroticism O
. O

This O
element O
is O
often O
hidden O
under O
symbols O
, O
but O
sometimes O
clearly O
visible O
. O

Sexuality O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
a O
world O
of O
religion O
and O
magic O
, O
unifying O
force O
and O
means O
of O
integration O
. O

The O
fertility O
of O
the O
woman O
is O
synonymous O
with O
life O
for O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
, O
as O
a O
force O
given O
by O
the O
Creator O
. O

Thus O
sexuality O
takes O
on O
a O
sacred O
character O
, O
with O
the O
sexual O
organs O
almost O
always O
becoming O
the O
object O
of O
worship O
. O

Another O
motif O
of O
great O
importance O
is O
the O
tree O
of O
life O
, O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
represent O
" O
the O
interconnectedness O
of O
all O
mankind O
" O
. O
" O

They O
do O
n't O
live O
as O
individuals O
like O
we O
do O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
they O
live O
as O
a O
unity O
, O
which O
they O
want O
to O
represent O
artistically O
in O
the O
tree O
of O
life O
" O
, O
Verdonk B-PER
explains O
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
primitive O
people O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
alone O
, O
he O
could O
never O
answer O
the O
question O
of O
exhibition O
visitors O
, O
what O
is O
the O
name O
of O
each O
artist O
. O
" O

There O
no O
one O
signs O
his O
work O
, O
as O
with O
us O
, O
where O
the O
name O
is O
often O
more O
important O
than O
the O
actual O
work O
of O
art O
" O
. O

The O
exhibits O
shown O
in O
Hanau B-LOC
convey O
something O
uncanny O
, O
they O
express O
what O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
may O
have O
felt O
during O
the O
production O
. O

The O
magical O
world O
from O
which O
they O
come O
is O
omnipresent O
, O
is O
even O
capable O
of O
instilling O
fear O
in O
the O

that O

The O
city O
of O
Bad B-LOC
Vilbel I-LOC
therefore O
asked O
the O
district O
to O
build O
a O
sewer O
. O

Because O
although O
the O
school O
building O
was O
once O
built O
by O
the O
city O
, O
it O
has O
become O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
district O
. O

The O
more O
than O
100,000 O
Marks O
expensive O
sewer O
construction O
hurts O
the O
circle O
shaken O
by O
financial O
shortage O
very O
much O
, O
particularly O
since O
the O
city O
school O
was O
just O
renovated O
for O
approximately O
600,000 O
Marks O
fireproof O
. O

After O
an O
inspection O
on O
Wednesday O
Harald B-PER
Mehr I-PER
, O
head O
of O
the O
school O
administration O
in O
Friedberg B-LOC
, O
said O
that O
the O
district O
would O
rather O
put O
the O
money O
into O
other O
projects O
. O

The O
school O
board O
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
get O
permission O
from O
the O
city O
to O
connect O
the O
storm O
sewer O
to O
the O
wastewater O
sewer O
through O
a O
spur O
line O
. O

That O
would O
cost O
only O
a O
fraction O
of O
a O
new O
line O
. O

But O
the O
city O
had O
not O
commented O
on O
this O
. O

First O
city O
councillor O
Klaus B-PER
Minkel I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
gives O
to O
concern O
that O
such O
a O
connection O
wants O
to O
be O
examined O
exactly O
. O

It O
must O
be O
controlled O
how O
much O
rainwater O
can O
flow O
through O
this O
channel O
into O
the O
sewer O
. O

If O
large O
water O
masses O
could O
flow O
in O
there O
, O
it O
is O
to O
be O
feared O
that O
the O
canalization O
in O
the O
Frankfurter B-LOC
Straße I-LOC
is O
flooded O
and O
the O
toilet O
contents O
float O
around O
in O

cellars O

On O
the O
question O
whether O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
close O
the O
washbasins O
if O
it O
was O
now O
planned O
to O
build O
the O
new O
canal O
in O
the O
autumn O
vacations O
, O
Minkel B-PER
said O
that O
this O
had O
been O
a O
decision O
of O
the O
district O
. O

The O
channel O
could O
have O
been O
built O
already O
in O
the O
summer O
vacations O
. O

The O
city O
was O
not O
ready O
to O
extend O
the O
deadline O
. O

Among O
parents O
and O
parents O
' O
representatives O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
the O
fear O
was O
expressed O
that O
the O
dispute O
between O
the O
politically O
divergent O
heads O
in O
the O
city O
and O
the O
district O
would O
now O
be O
carried O
out O
on O
the O
backs O
of O
the O
children O
. O

On O
inquiry O
of O
the O
FR B-ORG
, O
which O
waste O
water O
results O
, O
said O
principal O
Angelika B-PER
Ringler I-PER
- O
Friesenhahn O
, O
in O
the O
classes O
water O
is O
used O
for O
painting O
, O
the O
children O
learned O
in O
addition O
, O
before O
the O
breakfast O
the O
hands O
to O
wash O
, O
it O
must O
be O
cooled O
already O
times O
a O
bump O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
cleaners O
would O
work O
with O
degradable O
soft O
soap O
, O
it O
was O
not O
apparent O
that O
until O
the O
autumn O
vacations O
hazardous O
substances O
could O
enter O
the O
Nidda B-LOC
. O

There O
is O
no O
toilet O
in O
this O
building O
anyway O
. O

Presumably O
the O
small O
ones O
at O
the O
city O
school O
learn O
now O
not O
only O
writing O
, O
arithmetic O
and O
the O
contact O
with O
other O
children O
, O
they O
learn O
also O
the O
water O
carrying O
. O

Because O
nothing O
may O
be O
poured O
into O
the O
sink O
. O

The O
teachers O
, O
however O
, O
must O
remain O
in O
the O
class O
for O
supervision O
, O
says O
the O
principal O
. O

The O
janitor O
sells O
milk O
and O
rolls O
during O
the O
breaks O
and O
could O
not O
carry O
the O
buckets O
for O
ten O
classes O
in O
the O
short O
time O
, O
said O
the O
principal O
. O

A O
father O
asked O
with O
view O
of O
the O
real O
Nidda B-MISC
loads I-MISC
of O
the O
past O
however O
, O
why O
the O

could O
not O
be O
used O
now O
up O
to O
the O
canal O
construction O
in O
the O
autumn O
vacations O
, O

since O

But O
the O

was O
right O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
thunderstorm O
had O
knocked O
down O
a O
tree O

This O
in O
turn O
had O
cut O
the O
catenary O
, O
thus O
depriving O
the O
electric O
locomotive O
of O
juice O
and O
condemning O
the O

to O
a O

on O
the O

a O
good O
two O

before O

That O
was O
at O
18.30 O

About O
15 O

, O
the O
train O
and O
engine O
driver O
returned O
from O
a O
trip O
to O
the O

with O
the O
message O
that O

and O
would O
bring O
the O

In O
the O

a O
good O
part O

the O

examined O
the O
fallen O

and O
the O
torn O
catenary O
, O
others O
passed O
the O

The O
promised O

was O
a O

, O
and O
with O
the O
onset O
of O
dusk O
also O
the O
equanimity O
of O

Nevertheless O

the O
angry O
part O
of O
the O
passengers O
had O
already O
left O

It O
was O
incomprehensible O

that O

had O
not O

long O

: O

accused O
Treutel B-PER
that O
he O
could O

should O
have O
known O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O

in O

when O
the O

on O

Spahn B-PER

asked O
in O
a O

on O
April O
23 O
how O
the O
compensation O

would O
be O

since O

that O

to O
go O
public O
with O
this O
information O
in O
the O
interest O
of O

Treutel B-PER
confirmed O
that O

: O

If O

He O
had O
therefore O
thanked O

its O
restraint O

After O

In O
several O
steps O
Hillach B-PER
then O
tries O
to O
convince O
the O
audience O
that O
these O
protocols O
will O
later O
become O
quite O
essential O
for O
Benjamin B-PER
's I-PER
theory O
of O
modern O
narrative O
. O

Benjamin B-PER
, O
however O
, O
was O
not O
yet O
aware O
of O
the O
significance O
of O
these O
more O
or O
less O
randomly O
assembled O
narrative O
voices O
for O
his O
theory O
. O

His O
review O
of O
these O
protocols O
remained O
strangely O
colorless O
, O
" O
below O
his O
level O
" O
. O

Hillach B-PER
explains O
this O
in O
turn O
with O
Benjamin B-PER
's O
own O
relationship O
to O
death O
, O
a O
dialectical O
combination O
of O
death O
repression O
and O
mythical O
fear O
of O
death O
. O

Benjamin B-PER
seems O
to O
have O
forgotten O
the O
statements O
of O
the O
wounded O
and O
dying O
soldiers O
, O
which O
were O
also O
stenographed O
. O

Only O
when O
Hillach B-PER
finally O
draws O
a O
bow O
to O
Benjamin B-PER
's I-PER
suicide O
in O
Port B-LOC
Bou I-LOC
in O
1942 O
and O
asks O
why O
the O
writer O
had O
given O
up O
so O
quickly O
at O
that O
time O
, O
contradiction O
rises O
in O
the O
audience O
. O

There O
had O
been O
thousands O
of O
suicides O
to O
escape O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
it O
is O
interjected O
. O

And O
: O

For O
Benjamin B-PER
, O
suicide O
had O
been O
something O
real O
, O
imaginable O
, O
a O
" O
last O
resort O
" O
, O
but O
also O
a O
" O
heroic O
act O
under O
the O
conditions O
of O
modernity O

The O
atmosphere O
nevertheless O
remains O
friendly O

The O
Benjamin B-MISC

One O
complements O

other O

consideration O

the O

interest O

this O
author O

Eckhardt B-PER
Köhn I-PER
also O
meets O
with O
benevolent O
agreement O
in O
the O
group O
. O

He O
has O
dealt O
with O
Benjamin B-PER
's I-PER
self O
- O
image O
as O
a O
writer O
and O
insists O
that O
with O
an O

like O
Benjamin B-PER
one O
must O
take O
every O
remark O
about O
one O

very O
seriously O

The O
self O
- O
statement O
" O
A O
last O
, O
as O

" O
serves O
him O
as O
an O
approach O

Benjamin B-PER
in O
the O
tradition O
of O
a O
Mallarmé B-PER

George B-PER
, O

He O
would O
have O
become O
an O
aestheticist O

but O
he O
came O
too O
late O

" O

Probably O
the O
event O
would O
have O
turned O
out O
more O
argumentative O
, O
had O
Barbara B-PER

says O
Thomas B-PER
Regehly I-PER
, O
the O
second O
of O
the O
two O
editors O
, O
" O
whether O
the O
image O

creates O
of O
Benjamin B-PER
is O
correct O
: O

That O
of O
a O
lust O

hostile O

weak O

his O

only O
a O

of O

an O

us O

" O

The O
members O
do O
what O
seems O
important O
to O
them O
. O
" O

We O
do O
demand O
socio O
- O
political O
commitment O
from O
everyone O
. O
" O

And O
that O
of O
course O
also O
means O
to O
deal O
with O
critical O
and O
current O
questions O
- O
for O
example O
paragraph O
218 O
. O
May O
the O
church O
superiors O
there O
also O
dogmatically O
stubbornly O
help O
fellow O
men O
: O

not O
only O
far O
from O
home O
, O
in O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
things O
are O
open O
: O

" O
All O
opinions O
are O
represented O
here O
, O
" O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
. O

We O
talk O
about O
everything O
. O
" O

We O
work O
freely O
, O
are O
not O
under O
pressure O
from O
the O
parishes O
or O
from O
other O
bodies O
. O
" O

Can O
Schlosser B-PER
imagine O
a O
discussion O
round O
with O
the O
church O
critic O
Eugen B-PER
Drewermann I-PER
? O
" O

Why O
not O
? O
" O

The O
interest O
, O
especially O
among O
young O
people O
, O
would O
certainly O
be O
there O
. O

But O
whether O
Drewermann B-PER
would O
come O
to O
a O
place O
like O
Hochheim B-LOC
, O
Schlosser B-PER
asks O
. O

The O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
has O
also O
critically O
illuminated O
another O
topic O
: O

500 O
years O
after O
Columbus B-PER
. O

The O
anniversary O
was O
for O
the O
members O
little O
reason O
to O
celebrate O
, O
but O
rather O
cause O
for O
reflection O
. O

After O
all O
, O
they O
help O
in O
many O
countries O
to O
alleviate O
the O
consequences O
of O
exploitation O
: O

In O
Brazil B-LOC
, O
for O
example O
, O
where O
a O
project O
aims O
to O
stop O
the O
rural O
exodus O
of O
people O
, O
or O
in O
Nigeria B-LOC
, O
with O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
well O
and O
a O
vocational O
training O
center O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
only O
far O
from O
home O
that O
we O
need O
to O
do O
something O
for O
our O
fellow O
human O
beings O
. O

Just O
the O
emigrants O
and O
Übersiedler O
need O
support O
with O
the O
integration O
into O
the O
society O
. O

Tips O
on O
tenant O
protection O
, O
social O
law O
and O
other O
questions O
of O
everyday O
life O
are O
necessary O
. O

Schlosser B-PER
's O
example O
: O

" O
The O
insurance O
agents O
are O
banging O
down O
people O
's O
doors O
, O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
are O
signing O
. O
" O

So O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
Family I-ORG
also O
tries O
its O
hand O
at O
consumer O
advice O
. O

Such O
commitment O
costs O
not O
only O
time O
, O
but O
also O
money O
. O
" O

We O
just O
have O
to O
do O
some O
things O
" O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
citing O
the O
social O
part O
of O
family O
life O
as O
a O
source O
of O
finance O
: O

Seven O
events O
at O
carnival O
and O
the O
stand O
at O
the O
wine O
festival O
must O
yield O
enough O
to O
make O
ends O
meet O
. O

And O
of O
course O
donations O
are O
always O
collected O
- O
also O
at O
the O
birthday O
party O
for O
the O
70th O
anniversary O
on O
Sunday O
, O
August O
30 O
, O
10.30 O
am O
, O
in O
the O
church O
of O
Peter B-PER
and O
Paul B-PER
. O

The O
money O
is O
to O
go O
to O
Peter B-PER
Osuchukwu I-PER
. O

The O
priest O
from O
Nigeria B-LOC
wants O
to O
use O
it O
to O
finance O
projects O
in O
his O
home O
parish O
. O

But O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
seems O
to O
make O
little O
impression O
on O
young O
people O
. O
" O

We O
are O
like O
all O
the O
others O
" O
, O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
referring O
to O
declining O
numbers O
. O

Yet O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
on O
offer O
for O
young O
people O
- O
the O
regular O
meetings O
, O
for O
example O
, O
or O
the O
educational O
vacation O
, O
the O
destination O
of O
which O
is O
chosen O
by O
the O
group O
itself O
. O
" O

Well O
, O
" O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
" O
for O
the O
future O
I O
wish O
that O
the O
young O
people O
would O
participate O
more O
. O

Because O
only O
in O
this O
way O
can O
they O
help O
shape O
society O
, O
through O
involvement O
in O
associations O
, O
parties O
or O
in O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
