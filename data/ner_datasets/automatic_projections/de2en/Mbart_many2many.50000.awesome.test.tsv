Clemens B-PER
Jäger I-PER
( O

derived O
in O
this O
connection O
the O
remarkable O
statement O
, O
excessive O
water O

must O
be O
avoided O
again O
in O
the O

, O
which O
Karl O

led O

The O

unambiguous O

it O
was O
also O
a O
joint O
motion O
by O
the O

The O
Greens B-ORG
must O
meanwhile O
have O
their O
ears O
clenched O

Certainly O
their O
all O

rounder O
Christian B-PER
Groß I-PER
would O
have O
also O
noticed O
a O
few O
more O
words O
, O
and O
because O
he O
was O
missing O
this O

, O
that O
was O
also O
somehow O
missed O
. O

Then O
there O
was O
still O
the O
new O
municipal O
cemetery B-MISC
set O
to O
be O
discussed O
, O
which O
encouraged O
Karl B-PER
H. I-PER
Erb I-PER
of O
the O
Union B-ORG
and O
Andreas B-PER
Lämmermann I-PER
to O
longer O
executions O
, O
which O
would O
certainly O
not O
have O
remained O
unanswered O
by O
the O
Greens B-ORG
. O

was O
interested O
in O

in O
which O
the O
arguments O
for O
the O
future O

dismissal O
of O

the O

who O

on O

while O

act O
unimpeded O
in O
the O
five O

One O
, O
who O
no O

in O

was O
nevertheless O
in O

again O
: O

The O
“ O
Juventus B-MISC
player I-MISC
” O
, O
as O
Stepanovic B-PER
Andreas B-PER
Möller I-PER
also O
calls O
it O
, O
was O
haunted O
by O
all O
the O
heads O
. O

And O
Captain O
Uli B-PER
Stein I-PER
finally O
put O
into O
words O
what O
many O
thought O
: O

" O
It O
also O

without O
Möller B-PER

There O
will O
be O
more O

Another O

who O
at O
the O
moment O
of O

no O
one O
cried O
a O
tear O
behind O

in O
his O

A O
clap O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
former O
Aschaffenburger B-MISC
, O
afterwards O
praising O
words O
about O
his O
" O
very O
good O
performance O
" O
. O

The O
Frankfurters B-MISC
had O
to O
win O
even O
higher O
on O
this O
day O

Especially O
leg B-PER
offered O
itself O
immediately O
three O
times O
the O
opportunity O
to O
increase O
. O

But O
the O
nearest O
was O
only O
Yeboah B-PER

His O
shot O
from O
20 O
meters O
, O
however O
, O
fell O
only O
against O
the O
pole O
, O
after O
the O

Stefan B-PER

easily O
understood O
the O
ball O
in O
a O

Symptomatic O

" O

The O

But O
I O

" O
Stepanovic B-PER

to O

the O

into O
a O

light O

At O

Bartsch B-PER
also O
believes O
that O
the O

not O

scepticism O
of O
his O

in O
a O
row O
despite O
high O
objectives O
has O
failed O
to O
get O
off O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
technical O
director O
Karlheinz B-PER
Kühn I-PER
no O
longer O
understands O
the O
world O
: O

" O
We O
have O
had O
an O
excellent O
preparation O
, O
the O
mood O
in O
the O
team O
is O
good O
, O
and O
we O
have O
strengthened O
our O
squad O
through O
above O
- O
average O
players O
who O
also O
fit O
humanly O
to O
us O
. O

As O
a O
problem O
in O
the O
first O
matches O
I O
can O
only O
discover O
the O
shape O
crisis O
of O
our O
goalkeeper O
Vogler B-PER
, O
but O
that O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
corrected O
after O
the O
last O
two O
games O
as O
well O
. O
” O

Coach O
Wulf B-PER
gives O
further O
reasons O
for O
the O
misstart O
: O

" O
We O
had O
to O
install O
six O
new O
players O
, O
which O
takes O
his O
time O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
performers O
such O
as O
Schröder B-PER
and O
Feyen B-PER
were O
long O
injured O
, O
and O
the O
great O
talent O
Michael B-PER
Sauer I-PER
has O
been O
rather O
confused O
than O
built O
up O
by O
the O
many O
contacts O
with O
Bundesliga B-MISC
players I-MISC
. O
" O

With O
these O
arguments O
you O
may O
be O
able O
to O
explain O
the O
misstart O
in O
this O
season O
, O
but O
there O
remain O
further O
questions O
: O

How O
is O
it O
that O
the O
SV B-ORG
Wehen I-ORG
, O
despite O
prominent O
new O
entrances O
in O
the O
last O
three O
years O
among O
five O
different O
coaches O
regularly O
disappointed O
? O

Where O
are O
the O
reasons O
why O
Bundesliga B-MISC
- O
trained O
players O
such O
as O
Schröder B-PER
, O
Feyen B-PER
, O
Sauer B-PER
or O
Caic B-PER
have O
stagnated O
in O
their O
performance O
since O
they O
joined O
SV B-ORG
Wehen I-ORG
? O

The O
reasons O
for O
this O
must O
be O
sought O
in O
the O
structures O
of O
the O
association O
. O

Wehen O
has O
risen O
in O
an O
unprecedented O
leap O
from O
1986 O
to O
1989 O
from O
the O
A O
- O
Class O
to O
the O
upper O
league O
and O
has O
maintained O
structures O
that O
have O
proven O
themselves O
in O
the O
lower O
classes O
, O
for O
an O
upper O
league O
aspirant O
but O
must O
be O
checked O
. O

Thus O
, O
some O
players O
who O
have O
been O
transferred O
from O
other O
clubs O
after O
weeping O
complain O
that O
it O
is O
too O
rural O
, O
too O
family O
- O
friendly O
and O
too O
cozy O
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
you O
get O
used O
to O
the O
arduous O
trash O
and O
feel O
comfortable O
in O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

Karlheinz B-PER
Kühn I-PER
admits O
that O
the O
team O
sometimes O
gets O
too O
quickly O
satisfied O
: O

" O
After O
the O
cup O
game O
against O
the O
Eintracht B-ORG
there O
was O
an O
almost O
relaxed O
mood O
in O
our O
team O
, O
even O
though O
they O
should O
have O
noticed O
with O
more O
self O
- O
criticism O
that O
they O
had O
not O
delivered O
the O
Eintracht B-ORG
any O
lost O
fight O
. O
" O

Some O
players O
also O
regard O
medical O
care O
as O
not O
optimal O
. O

She O
is O
being O
held O
responsible O
for O
15 O
serious O
injuries O
in O
the O
past O
season O
. O

Surprisingly O
, O
that O
Wehen O
as O
the O
only O
top O
club O
of O
the O
Oberliga O
only O
trains O
three O
times O
a O
week O
. O

The O
Offenbachers B-MISC
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
train O
five O
to O
six O
times O
a O
week O
. O

Possibly O
also O
contains O
the O
Wehener B-ORG
model O
, O
to O
offer O
players O
in O
the O
operation O
of O
Han B-PER
Chamber I-PER
a O
good O
professional O
perspective O
, O
a O
tricky O
trap O
. O

Heinz B-PER
Hankammer I-PER
has O
also O
come O
into O
trouble O
over O
such O
questions O
. O

On O
Sunday O
morning O
he O
told O
the O
FR B-ORG
: O

" O
I O
have O
discovered O
a O
certain O
phlegma O
in O
the O
team O

am O
accordingly O
sour O
. O

I O
will O
discuss O
all O
problems O
openly O
at O
a O
dinner O
with O
the O
team O
. O

One O
thing O
seems O
to O
me O
already O
certain O
, O
however O
, O
that O
in O
the O

we O
need O
to O
focus O

because O

had O

more O

Fortunately O

because O
the O

lacked O

and O
once O
again O
a O

with O

took O

He O
imposed O
three O

all O

Neukirchen B-ORG

, O
ten O
yellow O
cards O
and O
had O
more O

with O
his O
eleven O

decisions O
in O
the O
always O
good O

The O

had O
already O
had O
to O
go O
in O
the O

at O
the O

the O

However O
, O
Wendler B-PER
only O
gave O
a O

from O
Walldorf B-ORG

Libero O
Andreas B-PER

a O
little O
later O
he O

Robert B-PER
Gemeri I-PER
, O
who O
returned O
to O
the O
Walldorf O
team O
after O
his O
illness O
. O

Only O
then O
did O
the O
hosts O
get O
better O
into O
the O
game O
through O
their O
active O
posts O
Holtkamp B-PER
and O
Ferreira B-PER
and O
thus O
to O
first O
goal O
opportunities O
. O

Neukirchen B-ORG

Schlußmann O
Ernst B-PER
knew O
in O
this O
phase O
, O
however O
, O
how O
to O
prevent O
a O
setback O
. O

Shortly O
before O
the O
half O
- O
time O
break O
then O
referee O
Althaus B-LOC
presented O
the O
two O
teams O
and O
the O
observers O
his O
first O
- O
questionable O
- O
appearance O
. O

Gemeri B-PER
took O
Müller B-PER
clear O
of O
his O
legs O
, O
but O
the O
required O
eleven O
- O
meter O
stitch O
remained O
out O
. O

However O
, O
he O
did O
not O
leave O
his O
patch O
after O
the O
change O
. O

Because O
the O
Unpartei O
wanted O
to O
have O
recognized O
a O
foul O
of O
Trageser B-PER
on O
lubrication B-PER
. O

The O
resulting O
eleven O
meters O
were O
used O
by O
Romeo B-PER
Wendler I-PER
to O
guide O
the O
guests O
. O

And O
in O
the O
case O
of O

Englert B-PER
allegedly O
acted O
unfairly O
against O
stormer O
Dieter B-PER
Hormel I-PER

which O
was O
also O
punished O

a O

Then O
followed O
three O
questionable O

penalties O
against O
Neukircher B-ORG

so O
that O

the O
immense O

no O

On O
the O
side O
of O
those O
who O
are O
massively O
opposed O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Reinhardswald B-LOC

" O

One O
day O

according O
to O

prophecy O

" O
we O
shall O
then O
stand O

the O
ruins O

from O

Brechtel B-PER
cares O

Because O
the O
groundwater O
, O
he O
says O
, O
has O
already O
gotten O
worse O
. O

The O
forest O
hydrologist O
clearly O
blames O
the O
pollutants O
for O
this O
. O

They O
come O
over O
the O

the O
trees O
into O
the O
soil O
, O
which O
- O
if O
intact O
- O
is O
a O
fine O
filter O
. O

This O
ability O
to O
filter O
out O
pollutants O
, O
however O
, O
the O
soil O
has O
already O
lost O
, O
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
" O
sugar O

" O
. O

The O
forest O
floor O
is O
in O
many O
places O
already O
completely O

white O
board O

For O
example O
, O
aluminum O
has O
now O
entered O
the O

and O
thus O
the O
drinking O
water O
reservoir O
unhindered O
. O

The O
waterworks O
will O
soon O
have O
problems O
with O
this O
, O

advice O
: O

Instead O
of O
putting O
money O
into O
the O
then O
necessary O
water O
treatment O
, O
the O
water O
plants O
should O
" O
smartly O
" O
participate O

the O
costs O

hope O
that O
the O

a O
water O
producer O
survives O
thanks O
to O
these O

measures O
, O
until O
the O

Mahler B-PER

second O
symphony O
, O
c O
- O
mol O
, O
a O
giant O
piece O
of O
late O
romantic O
symphony O
, O
whose O
performance O
lasts O
almost O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
, O
is O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
its O
composition O
- O
orchestra O
, O

solos O
- O
rather O
than O
symphonic O
cantatas O
. O

At O
its O
first O
performance O
in O
1895 O
, O
this O
symphony O
provoked O
fierce O
controversy O
. O

Today O
, O
the O
piece O
belongs O
, O
probably O
because O
of O
its O
melodic O
" O
madness O
" O
and O
its O
harmonic O
drama O
to O
the O
more O
popular O

Mahler B-PER
- O
a O

by O
the O

whose O
final O
" O

" O
fell O
in O
the O
early O
60s O
of O

At O

there O
was O
talk O

Within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
interpretative O
sharpness O
with O
which O
Inbal B-PER
allowed O
the O
monumental O
work O
to O
develop O
comprehensible O
and O
logical O
, O
it O
was O
above O
all O
the O
vocal O
solos O
of O
Alexandra B-PER
Coku I-PER

Cornelia B-PER
Wulkopf I-PER
, O
which O
- O
in O
the O

guaranteed O
truly O

Things O
had O
gone O
quite O
differently O

Inbal B-PER
, O
who O
had O
the O

, O
the O
Prague B-ORG

, O
in O
charge O
, O
interpreted O
the O
difficult O
psychology O
in O
the O
headline O
in O
a O
way O
that O
made O
it O
resonate O
. O

As O
it O
seemed O
, O
the O
accents O
wandering O
through O
the O
ensemble O
were O
uncoordinated O
, O
the O
line O
only O
hesitatingly O
peeked O
out O
: O

An O
irritating O
disposition O
for O
Mahler B-PER
's I-PER
epic O
spreading O
symphony O
. O

This O
came O
initially O
only O
dull O
accentuated O
, O
false O
in O
the O
otherwise O
Aura O
surrounded O
stripe O
substance O
. O

Then O
the O
first O
beam O
signals O
, O
on O
time O
, O
precise O
and O
full O
radiation O
: O

This O
was O
a O
conductor O
's O
suggestion O
, O
but O
also O
orchestral O
, O
instrumental O
grace O
and O
virtuosity O
. O

Inbal B-PER
pushes O
everything O
forward O
indefinitely O
. O

The O
Eklat O
in O
Tutti O
has O
a O

but O
also O
stands O
- O
not O
less O
intensely O
- O
the O
morbid O
, O
" O
denouncing O
" O
gesture O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
becomes O
sugary O
: O

Of O
course O
, O
this O
belongs O
to O
Mahler B-PER
, O
who O
probably O
( O
except O
perhaps O
Richard B-PER
Strauß I-PER
) O
found O
the O
most O
beautiful O
melodies O
of O
the O
ending O
tonal O
era O
. O

The O
evaporates O
, O
sinks O
, O
builds O
up O
- O
plastically O
- O
new O
, O
thus O
has O
a O
clear O
basic O
idea O
. O

Wonderful O
was O
also O
the O
rhythmic O
" O
beating O
" O
that O
Inbal B-PER
seems O
to O
make O
the O
guiding O
motive O
of O
his O
interpretation O
. O

Also O
under O
this O
meaning O
the O
performance O
had O
a O
backbone O

This O
comes O

so O
it O
will O
Mahler B-PER

so O
it O
makes O
Inbal B-PER
, O
first O
in O

In O

Through O

that O

In O
view O
of O
the O
economic O
and O
political O
pressures O
in O
their O

which O
are O

, O
therefore O
some O

" O
the O

told O
him O
. O

Increasing O

not O

Politologists O

should O
accept O
this O
topic O
: O

" O
This O
is O
a O
fundamental O
concern O
of O
the O
population O
, O
because O
much O
is O
changing O
so O
rapidly O
; O
such O
as O
the O
economy O
or O
environmental O
pollution O
. O
" O

The O
existence O
of O
alien O
hostility O
is O
often O
a O
mirror O
of O
the O
social O
situation O
, O
" O
Körner B-PER
confirmed O
the O
woman O
. O

Also O
the O
speaker O
from O
the O
Institute B-ORG
of I-ORG
German I-ORG
Economy I-ORG
, O
Bernd B-PER
Hof I-PER
, O
called O
for O
a O
pedagogical O
approach O
. O

In O
his O
remarks O
, O
he O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
" O
the O
potential O
for O
migration O
is O
far O
greater O
than O
the O
potential O
for O
integration O
" O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
from O
a O
" O
labour O
market O
- O
oriented O
perspective O
" O
, O
the O
German B-MISC
economy O
is O
dependent O
on O
foreign O
workers O
. O

The O
Federal O
Republic B-LOC
owes O
its O
" O
social O
policy O
progress O
" O
to O
the O
" O
guest O
workers O
" O
. O

Without O
them O
, O
companies O
would O
have O
been O
able O
to O
rely O
on O
four O
million O
fewer O
workers O
in O
the O
last O
30 O
years O
. O

The O
potential O
of O
long O
- O
term O
unemployed O
, O
according O
to O
Hof B-PER
’s I-PER
thesis O
, O
is O
not O
without O
further O
integration O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
often O
- O
falling O
argument O
that O
foreigners O
are O
taking O
German B-MISC
jobs O
out O
of O
force O
. O

The O
ecological O

also O
not O
have O
been O
possible O
without O

a O
more O
employment O
- O

sector O
, O
the O
people O
of O
Burma B-LOC
need O
more O
labour O
, O
the O

says O
. O

With O

economic O
growth O
of O

percent O
, O
an O
average O
of O
300,000 O

foreign O
forces O

would O
be O
insufficient O

Because O

be O
taken O
into O
account O
, O
the O
Court B-PER
called O
for O
" O

The O
SCHWEINE B-MISC

proves O
once O
again O
how O
diverse O
toys O
can O
be O
. O

As O
game O
characters O
, O
each O
of O
the O
two O
to O
four O
players O
gets O
two O
fat O
, O
hilly O
sacks O
and O
a O
few O
gold O
coins O
, O
which O
he O
can O
distribute O
to O
the O
two O
heels O
according O
to O
Gusto O
. O

Symbols O
can O
be O
found O
across O
the O
schedule O
. O

There O
you O
can O
read O
gold O
coins O
on O
the O
way O
and O
put O
in O
any O
pig O
- O
of O
course O
your O
own O
. O

Or O
there O
are O
black O
evil O
thalers O
. O

You O
can O
also O
put O
them O
in O
any O
pig O

of O
course O
an O

And O
finally O
, O
the O

from O
the O

, O
hold O
it O
in O

So O
you O
can O

a O

The O

do O
not O

each O

from O
the O

If O
a O
field O
is O
occupied O
, O
it O
is O
simply O
not O

That O

Whoever O
is O
once O

, O
no O

comes O
forward O
quickly O
, O
because O
he O
can O
not O

In O

Then O

so O
that O

But O
with O
this O

the O

If O
both O

it O
is O
much O
harder O
to O
notice O
which O

only O

The O
title O
SCHWEINSGALOPP B-MISC
sounds O
similar O
, O
but O
the O
game O
is O
completely O
different O

The O
highly O
enjoyable O
graphic O
is O
child O
- O
friendly O
and O
leads O
as O
false O
as O
the O
age O
indication O
six O
to O
twelve O
years O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
children O
in O
this O
age O
band O
can O
play O
this O
game O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
also O
an O
unknown O
and O
in O
this O
darkness O
also O
almost O
unexplored O
burner O
for O
adults O
. O

The O
SCHWEINSGALOPP B-MISC
has O
since O
become O
established O
with O
us O
as O
a O
constant O
fast O
" O
intermediate O
game O
" O
and O
triggers O
enthusiasm O
with O
anyone O
who O
knows O
it O
. O

The O
plan O
shows O
a O
round O
course O
without O
starting O
and O
finishing O
. O

On O
it O
you O
place O
five O
colorful O
racing O
pigs O
in O
any O
order O
. O

They O
are O
most O
loved O
cast O
out O
of O
massive O
plastic O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
be O
damn O
careful O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
fall O
into O
children O
's O
hands O
. O

Otherwise O
they O
are O
guaranteed O
missing O
in O
the O
toy O
box O
and O
wandering O
in O
trousers O
pockets O
or O
in O
the O
box O
with O
the O
construction O
blocks O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
schedule O
there O
are O
food O
chips O
. O

Each O
player O
gets O
seven O
cards O
. O

Initially O
, O
one O
searches O
, O
as O
with O
the O
different O
feed O
brands O
, O
for O
an O
interpretation O
for O
the O
graphics O
. O

But O
it O
's O
all O
much O
easier O
: O

Chip O
is O
Chip O
, O
and O
the O
cards O
count O
only O
the O
background O
color O
. O

Who O
is O
on O
the O
train O
, O
puts O
down O
a O
card O
and O
moves O
the O
pig O
of O
this O
color O
. O

So O
it O
does O
not O
belong O
to O
any O
player O
a O
certain O
figure O
. O

Everyone O
can O
pull O
any O
Sau O
. O

As O
with O
SCHWEINERENNEN B-MISC
, O
fields O
occupied O
here O
are O
not O
counted O
. O

A O
pig O
simply O
goes O
a O
field O
ahead O
, O
and O
if O
others O
stand O
in O
the O
way O
, O
they O
will O
be O
overtaken O
. O

If O
the O
currently O
moving O
Sau O
lands O
with O
her O
train O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
rudle O
, O
she O
will O
be O
offered O
a O
feeding O
chip O
as O
a O
reward O
. O

The O
player O
takes O
a O
box O
and O
puts O
it O
in O
front O
of O
himself O
. O

But O
she O
does O
n't O
belong O
to O
him O
yet O
. O

The O
round O
is O
fast O
to O
end O
, O
because O
everyone O
can O
only O
play O
seven O
cards O
. O

The O
trick O
is O
in O
the O
last O
move O
. O

Only O
when O
it O
manages O
to O
put O
a O
pig O
at O
the O
top O
, O
the O
food O
points O
collected O
so O
far O
are O
secured O
. O

Three O
rounds O
are O
played O
, O
which O
in O
routine O
players O
does O
not O
take O
ten O
minutes O
. O

The O
joke O
of O
the O
game O
lies O
in O
breaking O
the O
closed O
pulk O
of O
pigs O
by O
moving O
figures O
from O
the O
middle O
. O

This O
forces O
the O
fellow O
players O
to O
bring O
back O
the O
backsliders O
to O
the O
top O
field O
, O
which O
costs O
cards O
without O
inserting O
chips O
. O

But O
you O
can O
speculate O
so O
badly O
. O

Eh'you O
seal O
it O
, O
is O
exactly O
the O
Sau O
, O
which O
fits O
to O
the O
last O
card O
, O
hung O
and O
isolated O
. O

And O
some O
of O
the O
players O
are O
confused O
: O

" O
Being O
a O
pig O
is O
beautiful O
.. O

" O

The O

Do O
you O

Animal O
traces O
indicate O

Earlier O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
recognize O
and O
interpret O
animal O
traces O
was O
vital O
for O
humans O
, O
eventually O
often O
depending O
on O
hunting O
success O
or O
survival O
. O

Nowadays O
it O
is O
still O
important O
for O
hunters O
and O
foresters O
to O
be O
able O
to O
read O
traces O
in O
order O
to O
properly O
assess O
the O
wildlife O
. O

In O
our O
time O
it O
is O
important O
for O
the O
protection O
of O
wild O
animals O
that O
as O
many O
people O
as O
possible O
also O
have O
knowledge O
about O
their O
habits O
of O
life O
- O
because O
whoever O
can O
indicate O
animal O
traces O
, O
learns O
many O
behaviors O
of O
the O
animals O
. O

He O
can O
therefore O
also O
take O
more O
account O
of O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
wild O
animals O
than O
someone O
who O
walks O
so O
- O
called O
" O
blindly O
" O
through O
the O
forest O
and O
corridor O
. O

The O
search O
for O
traces O
can O
become O
an O
interesting O
hobby O
, O
in O
which O
one O
can O
also O
do O
something O
for O
his O
health O
. O

While O
one O
often O
on O
a O
walk O
through O
the O
forest O
and O
field O
except O
some O
birds O
and O
insects O
no O
other O
animal O
discovered O
, O
because O
most O
mammals O
at O
dusk O
. O

are O
nocturnal O
and O
shy O
, O
however O
, O
betray O
to O
the O
customer O
signs O
and O
traces O
that O
the O
animals O
have O
left O
, O
a O
lot O
about O
their O
presence O
and O
behavior O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
squirrels O
: O

Young O
squirrels O
must O
first O
learn O
to O
crack O
a O
nut O
properly O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
traces O
of O
the O
nails O
reveal O
to O
hazelnuts O
, O
whether O
a O
young O
, O
inexperienced O
or O
an O
old O
, O
routined O
animal O
tried O
as O
a O
nut O
- O
cracker O
here O
. O

Tracks O
of O
birds O
picking O
fruit O
are O
clearly O
visible O
on O
the O
picking O
tracks O
. O

Drossel O
tall O
apples O
by O
picking O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
bowl O
and O
then O
picking O
out O
the O
fruit O
meat O
, O
but O
the O
figs O
are O
less O
interested O
in O
the O
fruit O
meat O
, O
but O
only O
in O
the O
kernel O
. O

A O
walk O
in O
the O

can O
be O
quite O
exciting O
with O
such O
knowledge O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
last O
week O
the O
Praunheim B-MISC
organisers O
had O
still O
considered O
how O
best O
to O
deal O
with O
the O

The O

so O
that O
the O

between O
SG B-ORG

and O
FSV B-ORG

in O
the O
Women B-MISC

Bundesliga I-MISC
, O
which O
was O
expected O
with O
much O
excitement O
in O
the O
run O
- O
up O
, O
was O
just O
before O
the O
break O
. O

The O
cold O

met O
the O
host O
. O

Two O
minutes O
before O
the O
end O
of O
the O
game O
he O
went O
for O
a O
final O
bath O
. O

The O
defense O
got O
into O
swimming O
, O
brought O
the O
ball O
out O
of O
the O
danger O
zone O
, O
and O
Daniela B-PER
Stumpf I-PER
threw O
them O
to O
the O
decisive O
2:1(0:0 O

- O
victory O
of O
the O
guests O
in O
the O
shirts O
. O

Previously O
it O
had O
already O
burned O

in O
the O
SG B-MISC
- I-MISC

several O
times O
. O

Two O
times O
, O
the O
brilliantly O
laid O
SG B-MISC
goalkeeper I-MISC
Susanne B-PER
Becker I-PER
was O
able O
to O
" O
delete O
" O
when O
she O
caught O
a O
magnificent O
shot O
from O
Jennifer B-PER
Zeeck I-PER
still O
from O
the O
goal O
angle O
. O

Two O
headballs O
from O
Katja B-PER
Bornschein I-PER
nearly O
missed O
their O
goal O
, O
a O
third O
then O
caught O
up O
after O
Flanke O
of O
Sandra B-PER
Minnert I-PER
to O
lead O
the O
net O
. O

But O
also O
the O
FSV B-MISC
defense I-MISC
was O
not O
rarely O
in O
alarming O
condition O
, O
although O
the O
new O
old O
and O
reborn O
Libero O
Andrea B-PER
Heinrich I-PER
overall O
provided O
more O
stability O
. O

The O
sheep O
went O

Katja B-PER

Dagmar B-PER
Pohlmann I-PER
had O
finally O
" O
entered O
" O
the O
wrong O
hole O
, O
which O
missed O
a O
free O
kick O
from O
Christina B-PER
Schmidt I-PER
into O
her O
own O
case O
for O
the O
interim O
balancing O
stroke O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
guests O
were O
closer O
to O
their O
second O
goal O
than O
the O
SG B-ORG
to O
their O
first O
. O

While O
the O
host O
lived O
off O
his O
endless O
fighting O
passion O
, O
the O
FSV B-ORG
benefited O
from O
his O
game O
- O
technical O
and O
runnerial O
plus O
, O
which O
led O
to O
an O
optical O
overweight O
. O

The O
SG B-MISC
- I-MISC
specific I-MISC
setting O
, O
however O
, O
had O
something O
contagious O
. O

On O
bends O
and O
breaks O
, O
the O
rivals O
fought O
their O
two O
battles O
. O

The O
Derby O
character O
was O
fully O
remembered O
in O
the O
players O
. O

The O
psychological O
problems O
predicted O
by O
many O
in O
the O
run O
- O
up O
to O
the O
encounter O
at O
FSV B-ORG
seemed O
to O
be O
gone O
. O

The O
team O
discipline O
so O
much O
desired O
by O
the O
new O
coach O
Peter B-PER
Walz I-PER
experienced O
its O
first O
bloom O
. O

Still O
under O
the O
week O
in O
training O
she O
was O
not O
to O
be O
distinguished O
from O
Walz B-PER
. O

In O
an O
exercise O
game O
, O
the O
ball O
of O
the O
thrower O
was O
thrown O
by O
a O
player O
not O
rationally O
, O
but O
uncontrollably O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
conditional O
coach O
at O
TV B-ORG
Großwallstadt I-ORG
asked O
for O
ten O
track O
races O
. O

Afterwards O
they O
continued O
to O
play O
. O
" O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
put O
the O
girls O
down O
, O
" O
adds O
Walz B-PER
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
gymnasium O
teacher O
values O
his O
actions O
" O
as O
proof O
of O
his O
power O
" O
. O

Dieter B-PER
Richter I-PER
was O
powerless O
, O
who O
entrusted O
the O
forgiven O
goal O
chances O
. O

Still O
his O
new O
entrances O
have O
not O
really O
taken O
foot O
. O

Five O
of O
them O
he O
integrated O
into O
the O
eleven O
, O
making O
them O
regular O
players O
. O

However O
, O
an O
outstanding O
player O
against O
the O
FSV B-ORG
was O
an O
old O
Vera B-PER
Heck I-PER
. O

Game O
leader O
Simone B-PER
Damerau I-PER
on O
the O
other O
hand O
has O
to O
continue O
to O
press O
the O
replacement O
bank O
, O
which O
led O
her O
to O
some O
resentment O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
everyone O
could O
convince O
himself O
that O
the O
power O
of O
the O
FSV B-ORG
is O
no O
longer O
unattainable O
. O

The O
SG B-ORG
has O
found O
the O
connection O
and O
lost O
again O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
. O

There O
is O
therefore O
no O
reason O
to O
drink O
over O
the O
thirst O
for O
a O
fee O

explains O
, O
" O
that O
the O
Bible B-MISC
is O
being O
read O
less O

. O

So O
Christians B-MISC
in O

have O
had O
something O
to O
do O
together O
beyond O

Therefore O
, O
the O
rumbling O
about O
the O

intended O
to O
ease O

In O
this O

says O
the O

from O

" O
Christians B-MISC
do O
this O

: O

Perhaps O
the O
believers O
do O
not O
always O
read O

perhaps O
more O

adds O
that O
it O
should O
also O
be O
advertised O
for O
a O
new O
reading O
of O
the O

Finally O
, O
the O
Bible B-MISC

for O

a O

the O

Reception O
rules O
for O
medicines O

Many O
rheumatoid O
medicines O
, O
but O
also O
medications O
against O
constipation O
, O
enzyme O
preparations O
and O
some O
pills O
against O
depression O
are O
offered O
to O
patients O
in O
a O
special O
form O
: O

are O
surrounded O
by O
a O
" O
magenta O
juice O
resistant O
" O
protective O
cover O
. O

This O
means O
that O
such O
drugs O
only O
dissolve O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
and O
from O
there O
their O
active O
substances O
fully O
develop O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
is O
also O
the O
consideration O
that O
the O
aggressive O
stomach O
juice O
should O
not O
affect O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
preparation O
and O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
stomach O
mucosa O
should O
not O
come O
into O
contact O
with O
the O
ingredients O
of O
the O
medicine O
. O

Generally O
, O
for O
" O
meat O
juice O
- O
resistant O
" O
or O
" O
diarrheal O
- O
resistant O
" O
medicines O
until O
now O
was O
usually O
the O
rule O
of O
taking O
the O
dose O
prescribed O
by O
the O
doctor O
to O
swallow O
along O
with O
the O
food O
. O

Recent O
investigations O
by O
gastroenterologists O
( O
gastrointestinal O
specialists O
) O
show O
, O
however O
, O
that O
this O
is O
clearly O
completely O
wrong O
. O

The O
checks O
showed O
that O
medications O
remain O
in O
the O
stomach O
much O
longer O
when O
taken O
together O
with O
food O
. O

The O
dragees O
or O
capsules O
surrounded O
by O
a O
protective O
shell O
( O
often O
also O
known O
as O
Retard O
pharmaceuticals O
with O
long O
- O
term O
effect O
) O
remain O
as O
insoluble O
in O
the O
stomach O
and O
therefore O
do O
not O
get O
into O
the O
intestine O
with O
the O
digestive O
tract O
pre O
- O
dried O
by O
the O
stomach O
juice O
. O

Particularly O
unfavourable O
is O
if O
you O
postpone O
a O
short O
time O
( O
less O
than O
two O
hours O
) O
after O
a O
main O
meal O
with O
simultaneous O
medication O
taking O
a O
small O
break O
. O

The O
digestion O
of O
these O
foods O
then O
has O
priority O
again O
and O
the O
medicines O
unlocked O
from O
the O
stomach O
juice O
remain O
in O
the O
stomach O
for O
up O
to O
twelve O
hours O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
, O
so O
the O
carefully O
taken O
medications O
in O
the O
stomach O
can O
duck O
regularly O
and O
clump O
together O
, O
because O
with O
the O
following O
main O
meals O
is O
usually O
already O
swallowed O
the O
next O
dose O
. O

You O
can O
withdraw O
the O
stomach O
with O
its O
digestive O
movements O
only O
by O
taking O
nothing O
to O
eat O
for O
more O
than O
two O
hours O
at O
all O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
stomach O
also O
transports O
the O
medicines O
left O
behind O
finally O
to O
where O
they O
belong O
- O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
. O

How O
, O
however O
, O
to O
prevent O
such O
withdrawal O
periods O
, O
which O
disturb O
the O
treatment O
and O
sometimes O
even O
prevent O
its O
success O
? O

According O
to O
the O
latest O
recommendations O
of O
the O
doctors O
, O
one O
should O
take O
so O
- O
called O
magenta O
juice O
- O
resistant O
, O
thinner O
- O
resistant O
medications O
better O
to O
calm O
down O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
during O
the O
day O
between O
meals O
. O

However O
, O
you O
must O
not O
bathe O
anything O
between O
the O
main O
meals O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
the O
stomach O
no O
longer O
holds O
up O
the O
medicines O
that O
are O
not O
digestible O
for O
it O
. O

Preparations O
taken O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
reach O
the O
small O
intestine O
within O
70 O
minutes O
at O
the O
latest O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
one O
must O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
natural O
rhythm O
of O
stomach O
activity O
: O

At O
night O
this O
organ O
rests O
, O
and O
medications O
with O
depot O
effect O
remain O
as O
well O
as O
other O
indigestible O
or O
difficult O
to O
digest O
foods O
so O
long O
as O
the O
stomach O
resumes O
its O
digestion O
work O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

It O
is O
also O
to O
be O
noted O
that O
medications O
are O
always O
present O
and O
should O
be O
taken O
with O
plenty O
of O
liquid O
. O

They O
then O
slide O
better O
and O
do O
not O
stay O
halfway O
stuck O
in O
the O
pan O
. O

Since O
these O
take O
- O
up O
recommendations O
comply O
with O
the O
latest O
medical O
knowledge O
, O
they O
are O
generally O
not O
yet O
very O
well O
known O
. O

In O
case O
of O

very O

in O
the O
initial O
phase O
were O
initially O
the O
" O
false O
" O
jersey O
colors O
of O
the O
two O
local O

. O

While O
the O
Bockenheimers B-MISC
advanced O
in O

, O
the O
FSV B-ORG
played O
in O
the O
traditional O
red O
and O
white O
colours O
of O
the O

. O

And O
like O
a O
guest O
team O
the O
FSV B-ORG
initially O
also O
played O

The O
Bockenheimers B-MISC
determined O
in O
the O

half O
of O
the O
game O
, O
combined O
better O
and O
had O
after O
a O
quarter O

also O
through O
a O
flat O
shot O
by O
Björn B-PER
Pistauer I-PER
, O
who O
passed O
a O

at O
the O
FSV B-MISC
goal I-MISC
, O
the O
first O
great O
chance O
. O

It O
was O
striking O
, O
how O
much O
space O
the O
FSV B-ORG
, O
which O
appeared O
strangely O
insecure O
, O
left O
the O

. O

Then O
the O
FSV B-ORG
also O
had O
to O
change O
, O
since O
Ralf B-PER
Zgraja I-PER
after O
28 O
minutes O
was O
already O
so O
severely O
injured O
that O
he O
had O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

For O
him O
, O
Michael B-PER
Sandt I-PER
, O
the O
FSV B-MISC
trainer I-MISC
Dörenberg B-PER
referred O
to O
as O
his O
model O
student O
, O
took O
over O
the O
man O
cover O
against O
Michael B-PER
Rexroth I-PER
. O

Nine O
minutes O
later O
came O
the O
next O
blow O
for O
the O
FSV B-ORG
: O

After O
a O
harmless O
duel O
with O
Thomas B-PER
Hoßmang I-PER
, O
Marco B-PER
Grevelhörster I-PER
was O
sentenced O
to O
life O
imprisonment O
by O
the O
little O
referee O
. O

But O
with O
ten O
men O
, O
the O
FSV B-ORG
finally O
showed O
the O
bite O
, O
which O
they O
had O
missed O
up O
to O
then O
, O
and O
reached O
by O
Collins B-PER
Etebu I-PER
the O
first O
chance O
shortly O
before O

, O
but O
even O
this O
shot O
attempt O
remained O
hanging O
in O
the O

Thanks O
to O
referee O
Steudter B-PER

who O
distributed O
four O
yellow O
cards O
and O
a O
time O
penalty O
in O
the O
first O
45 O
minutes O
, O
there O
was O
at O
least O
a O
bit O
of O
conversation O
during O
the O
break O
. O

The O
game O
itself O
offered O
little O
cause O
for O
discussion O
until O
then O

After O

the O
FSV B-ORG

At O
