On O
the O
basis O

calculates O

Nevertheless O
, O
in O
many O
areas O

, O
it O
considers O
it O

The O
question O

In O

which O

they O

concerned O

the O

consuming O
, O
and O
in O
critical O
cases O
they O
also O
plead O
for O

. O

The O
first O
step O
was O
to O
make O
environmental O
compatibility O
the O
purchase O
criterion O
. O

The O
consumer O
movement O
in O
the O

, O
it O

But O
the O
last O

left O
many O
critics O
speechless O

It O
is O
certainly O
too O
early O
to O
see O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
capital O

out O
of O

In O
fact O
, O
two O
conditions O
are O
indispensable O
: O

Corporate O
profits O
must O
not O
continue O
to O
fall O
, O
and O
financial O
institutions O
must O
find O
a O
viable O
solution O
to O
manage O
their O
non O
- O
performing O
loans O
. O

There O
are O
still O
considerable O
doubts O
on O
both O
points O
. O

Surveys O
clearly O
show O
that O
industry O
needs O
to O
adjust O
its O
earnings O
expectations O
further O
downwards O
for O
the O
current O
year O
, O
after O
serious O
losses O
were O
already O
accepted O
in O
1991 O
. O

Especially O
the O
successful O
electronics O
companies O
fear O
further O
collapses O
. O

Even O
worse O
, O
it O
bagges O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
metal O
industry O
. O

Nippon B-ORG
Steel I-ORG
, O
for O
example O
, O
expects O
a O
break O

As O
long O
as O
no O
one O
knows O
whether O
this O
really O
has O
gone O
through O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
valley O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
hope O
reigns O
. O

This O
is O
what O
Tokyo B-LOC
obviously O
no O
longer O
wants O
to O
rely O
on O
alone O
. O

In O
view O
of O
the O
depressed O
mood O
, O
Finance O
Minister O
Hata B-PER
did O
not O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
talk O
to O
his O
colleagues O
about O
an O
expensive O
12 O
- O
point O
aid O
programme O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
to O
be O
done O
is O
to O
restore O
confidence O
in O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
banking O
system O
, O
according O
to O
its O
justification O
for O
official O
generosity O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
government O
suggests O
that O
banks O
, O
insurance O
companies O
and O
real O
estate O
companies O
should O
form O
a O
common O
real O
estate O
fund O
with O
state O
aid O
. O

The O
money O
from O
this O
could O
be O
used O
to O
finance O
the O
purchase O
of O
land O
that O
is O
now O
practically O
in O
the O
air O
as O
collateral O
for O
bank O
loans O
. O

We O
are O
talking O
about O
a O
minimum O
necessary O
amount O
of O
35 O
billion O
marks O
. O

How O
the O
Monopoly B-MISC
game I-MISC
should O
run O
, O
remains O
first O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

However O
, O
one O
thing O
is O
already O
clear O
today O
. O

In O
view O
of O
the O
high O
level O
of O
real O
estate O
market O
and O
the O
empty O
cash O
registers O
of O
institutional O
investors O
, O
only O
the O
state O
is O
considered O
a O
potential O
land O
buyer O
. O

The O
taxpayer O
is O
condemned O
to O
pay O
the O
bill O
for O
the O
unprecedented O
land O
speculation O
of O
the O
1980s O
. O

But O
that O
's O
not O
enough O
genericity O
. O

The O
stock O
market O
shock O
moved O
Nippon B-LOC
's I-LOC
nervous O
government O
to O
further O
concessions O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
banks O
may O
, O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
, O
have O
a O
state O
- O
recognised O
right O
to O
freeze O
their O
balance O
sheets O
. O

With O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Finance O
, O
the O
depreciation O
of O
its O
share O
losses O
is O
postponed O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
current O
fiscal O
year O
on O
31 O
March O
1993 O
and O
thus O
disappears O
from O
the O
books O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
institutions O
will O
be O
allowed O
to O
lend O
their O
clients O
money O
at O
interest O
rates O
below O
the O
discount O
rate O
currently O
3.25 O
percent O
. O

The O
government O
ascribes O
this O
infiltration O
of O
monetary O
policy O
to O
tax O
evasion O
. O

Tokyo B-LOC

but O
it O
would O
actually O

again O
after O

This O
has O
led O
to O
hectic O

since O
the O
announcement O
that O

Would O

the O

In O
any O

be O
applicable O

After O
the O
rapid O
declarations O
of O
farewell O
to O
Mr O

, O
the O
Secretary O

Sutter B-PER
will O
have O
to O
be O
discussed O
again O
this O
week O
between O
all O
the O
parties O
involved O
. O

The O
Secretary O
of O
State O
has O
half O
a O
year O
of O
decision O
- O
making O
after O
the O
resignation O
of O
the O
Member O
of O
Parliament O

Then O
he O
can O
either O
apply O
to O
become O
Secretary O
of O
State O
again O
( O
which O
would O
force O
the O
red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
government O
to O
decide O
) O
. O

Because O
he O
's O
already O
working O
in O
Bonn B-LOC
, O
that O
's O
not O
likely O
. O

Or O
he O
applied O
for O
the O
dismissal O
himself O
, O
with O
which O
he O
would O
have O
pension O
rights O
only O
at O
age O
, O
which O
75 O
percent O
for O
immediately O
fell O
away O
. O

But O
even O
that O
is O
gray O
, O
far O
too O
simple O
theory O
: O

In O
this O
case O
( O
fortunately O
for O
Sutter B-PER
) O
it O
is O
in O
fact O
not O
about O
75 O
percent O
, O
but O
only O
about O
less O
than O
ten O
percent O
: O

The O
49 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
was O
an O
administrative O
officer O
for O
many O
years O
, O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Deutsches B-ORG
Landkreistag I-ORG
and O
a O
social O
deputy O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
from O
1987 O
to O
1989 O
. O

He O
had O
been O
elected O
there O
for O
six O
years O
until O
1993 O
and O
thus O
even O
as O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Landtag O
he O
still O
had O
current O
pensions O
from O
the O
city B-LOC
of I-LOC
Frankfurt I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
why O
he O
received O
less O
of O
the O
rates O
of O
deputies O
: O

a O
truly O
impenetrable O
thicket O
. O

He O
has O
earned O
a O
high O
pension O
claim O
in O
any O
case O
" O
( O
sutter B-PER
) O
, O
and O
that O
is O
already O
at O
more O
than O
60 O
percent O
of O
his O
last O
active O
salary O
. O

Finally O
, O
after O
a O
Bonn B-MISC
amendment O
to O
the O
law O
which O
entered O
into O
force O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
, O
it O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
count O
its O
income O
under O
the O
dual O
system O
on O
such O
pension O
rights O
, O
which O
excludes O
double O
pay O
to O
the O
extent O
previously O
known O
. O

Now O
the O
experts O
examine O
who O
must O
pay O
what O
when O
- O
if O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State O
Sutter B-PER
has O
managed O
to O
follow O
the O
deputy O
Sutter B-PER
to O
Bonn B-LOC
. O

And O
even O
the O
most O
experienced O
among O
them O
openly O
admit O
that O
they O
had O
not O
yet O
" O
such O
a O

the O

is O

The O

But O
the O

do O

On O

which O
at O

to O
me O
on O

could O
well O
imagine O
, O
for O

, O
working O

living O
as O
a O

for O
a O

While O
in O
1978 O
I O
welcomed O
the O
establishment O
of O
Taraki B-LOC
by O
Soviet B-MISC
support O
- O
I O
must O
confess O
- O
still O
reluctantly O
, O
as O
a O
chance O
of O
a O
secularizing O
and O
" O
enlightenment O
" O
policy O
and O
social O
change O
, O
I O
was O
bitter O
about O
the O
Soviet B-MISC
invasion O
of O
Christmas O
1978 O
. O

I O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
Afghanistan B-LOC
would O
never O
be O
as O
I O
had O
experienced O
just O
before O
, O
even O
if O
the O
attacker O
was O
to O
be O
defeated O

If O
a O
country O
is O
occupied O
and O
cruelly O
warred O
for O
so O
long O
by O
a O
totally O
alien O
power O
with O
which O
there O
is O
no O
identification O
, O
a O
culture O
and O
life O
world O
must O
be O
damaged O

The O
centuries O

long O
delicate O

of O

would O
then O
be O
destroyed O

even O
by O
the O

as O
you O

In O
the O

after O
the O
initially O
welcomed O
fall O
of O
the O

it O
became O
clear O
what O
one O
has O
to O
think O
of O
an O
" O
Islamic B-MISC
State O
" O
, O
was O
to O
be O
feared O
that O
this O
could O
threaten O
after O
a O
victory O
of O
the O
Mujahedin B-ORG
also O
in O

This O
means O
that O

on O
the O
one O
hand O

the O
few O
secular O
sides O

a O

on O

development O
has O
become O
impossible O
. O

Although O
this O
decision O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
taken O
, O
it O
must O
now O
emerge O

Waigel B-PER
recommended O
that O

which O
had O
agreed O
to O

Otherwise O
, O
the O

Waigel B-PER
argued O
that O
part O

should O
be O
used O
by O
East B-MISC
German I-MISC
workers O
in O

as O
an O

The O
CDU B-MISC

Fink B-PER
also O
argued O
for O
investment O
wages O
, O
where O

are O
partly O
invested O

last O
week O
, O
Wall B-LOC

experienced O
a O
break O
- O
in O
on O
Friday O
. O

Main O
reason O
: O

The O
descent O
of O
the O
dollar O
. O

At O

mark O
he O
reached O
a O
historic O
low O
on O

Less O
than O
five O
interventions O
by O

central O

prevented O
the O
crash O
. O

The O
downfall O
of O
the O
greenback B-MISC
brought O
the O
stock O
market O
into O
turmoil O
. O

After O
a O
fixed O

the O
Dow O
- O
Jones B-MISC
index I-MISC
dropped O
by O
a O
good O
50 O
points O
to O
3254.10 O
. O

Borrowing O
rates O
were O
also O
under O
pressure O
. O

There O
are O
two O
main O
reasons O
for O
the O
dollar O
drop O
: O

The O
weak O
US B-MISC
economy I-MISC
and O
the O
high O
interest O
rate O
differential O
with O
Germany B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
the O
recent O
fall O
in O
prices O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
triggered O
by O
market O
mistrust O
of O
the O
Bush B-MISC
administration I-MISC
's O
economic O
policies O
and O
the O
vague O
economic O
policy O
formulations O
of O
Democratic O
candidate O
Bill B-PER
Clinton I-PER
. O

In O
his O
eagerly O
awaited O
speech O
on O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
Republican B-MISC
Party O
Congress O
in O
Houston B-LOC
, O
Texas B-LOC
, O
President O
Bush B-PER
announced O
that O
, O
in O
the O
event O
of O
his O
re O
- O
election O
, O
he O
would O
propose O
tax O
cuts O
on O
condition O
that O
they O
be O
paid O
with O
targeted O
spending O
cuts O
. O

Despite O
this O
condition O
, O
this O
immediately O
triggered O
warning O
signals O
on O
the O
financial O
markets O
because O
they O
fear O
an O
expansion O
of O
the O
budget O
deficit O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
long O
upswing O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
has O
mainly O
been O
driven O
by O
the O
small O
investors'army O
, O
who O
have O
switched O
to O
shares O
because O
of O
the O
low O
interest O
rate O
on O
their O
savings O
. O

The O
main O
beneficiaries O
of O
this O
policy O
are O
banks O
, O
which O
are O
able O
to O
clean O
up O
their O
weak O
balance O
sheets O
with O
the O
hefty O
difference O
between O
nominal O
and O
non O
- O
current O
interest O
rates O
. O

Many O
money O
houses O
had O
speculated O
in O
the O
real O
estate O
business O
in O
the O
Reagan B-MISC
years I-MISC
. O

Against O
the O
continuing O
economic O
weakness O
, O
however O
, O
low O
interest O
rates O
are O
increasingly O
proving O
to O
be O
a O
blunt O
weapon O
. O

The O
beneficiary O
of O
low O
interest O
rates O
is O
also O
the O
state O
itself O
, O
whose O
debt O
service O
is O
thus O
decreasing O
. O

After O
all O
, O
in O
July O
, O
they O
were O
the O
third O
largest O
item O

the O

, O
the O

considered O
it O

also O
picked O
up O
the O

a O

All O
this O
was O
preceded O
when O
Schaper B-PER
wrote O
down O
his O
notes O
in O
late O
autumn O

In O
the O

of O

that O

" O

I O
have O
encouraged O

to O
give O
his O

, O
Schaper B-PER
continued O

" O

My O
question O
, O
if O
possible O

Minister O
Rauls B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
parties O
concerned O
, O
was O
affirmed O
by O

" O

In O
the O
second O
note O
Schaper B-PER
stated O
that O
he O
had O
visited O
" O
Source O
" O
again O
in O
Hanover B-LOC

learned O
that O
the O
other O
member O
of O
the O
government O
might O
not O
be O
a O
minister O
but O
a O
secretary O
of O
state O

Matschke B-PER
had O
informed O
" O

that O
other O
burdened O
persons O
were O
working O
in O
senior O
positions O
of O
the O
police O

governments O
. O

However O
, O
the O
main O
theme O
of O
both O
notes O
were O
Matschke B-PER

claims O
for O
compensation O
to O
the O
Land B-LOC
of I-LOC
Saxony I-LOC
- O
Anhalt O
, O
which O
had O
only O
briefly O
employed O
him O
as O
" O
Security O
Officer O
" O
. O

Schaper B-PER
wrote O
: O

" O
Source O
estimates O
Mr. O
Matschke B-PER
so O
that O
if O
his O
financial O
claims O
against O
the O
country O
were O
adequately O
satisfied O
, O
he O
would O
not O
pass O
on O
any O
incriminating O
information O
to O
the O
country O
. O
" O

" O
Mushke B-PER
is O
not O
interested O
in O
burdening O
this O
government O
with O
negative O
information O
. O

This O
does O
not O
allow O
his O
political O
point O
of O
view O
, O
" O
Schaper B-PER
quoted O
the O
interlocutor O
. O

In O
the O
event O
that O
the O
proceedings O
were O
in O
dispute O
, O
information O
on O
highly O
burdened O
persons O
would O
certainly O
be O
discussed O
. O

With O
a O
reasonable O
compromise O
, O
Matschke B-PER
would O
be O
willing O
to O
" O
not O
let O
these O
things O
be O
reported O
in O

" O

But O
in O
order O
to O
restore O
his O
" O
honor O
" O
and O
his O
" O
business O
reputation O
" O
the O
Frankfurter B-MISC
will O
, O
according O
to O
the O
impression O
of O
the O
Hanoverian B-MISC
, O
make O
every O
effort O
to O
prove O
his O
professional O
activity O
for O
the O
Land B-LOC
of I-LOC
Saxony I-LOC
- O
Anhalt O
through O
testimonies O
. O

It O
could O
be O
assumed O
that O
Prime O
Minister O
Münch B-PER
and O
the O
Magdeburg B-MISC
Ministry O
of O
the B-ORG
Interior I-ORG
had O
immediately O
called O
on O
the O

Mahn B-PER

who O
had O
previously O
for O
a O
time O
headed O
the O
Constitutional B-ORG
Protection I-ORG
Office I-ORG
in O
Hanover B-LOC
, O
apparently O
also O
saw O
no O
need O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxony I-MISC
Interior B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
to O
the O
peculiar O
agent O
activity O
of O
the O
Lower B-MISC

official O
Boinowitz B-PER
, O
of O
which O
he O
had O
learned O
through O
Schaper B-PER

notes O
. O

In O
the O
fierce O
battles O
of O
the O
past O
days O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxon I-MISC
side O
also O
had O
to O
accept O
some O
questions O
: O

Why O
had O
the O
Hanoverian B-MISC
Constitutional O
Protection O
Office O
, O
when O
it O
believed O
to O
have O
received O
incriminating O
information O
about O
a O
Saxon B-MISC
- O
Hungarian O
minister O
, O
not O
addressed O
this O
itself O
? O

Or O
the O
head O
of O
government O
there O
? O

Or O
the O
special O
commission O
set O
up O
by O
the O
Magdeburger B-MISC
Landtag O
to O
review O
the O
Members O

Or O
the O
Gauck B-MISC
Authority I-MISC
? O

Would O
n't O
it O
have O
been O
best O
to O
turn O
the O
information O
right O
through O
the O
shredder O
because O
of O
low O
quality O
? O

These O
questions O
were O
all O
the O
more O
urgent O
when O
Minister O
of O
the O
Interior O
Glogowski B-PER
had O
in O
the O
meantime O
announced O
in O
his O
reply O
to O
an O
FDP B-ORG
request O
that O
the O
questioning O
of O
the O
former O
Stasi B-MISC
officer I-MISC
had O
also O
involved O
references O
to O
other O
East O
German B-MISC
politicians O
and O
to O
a O
West B-MISC
German I-MISC
who O
had O
been O
a O
member O
of O
a O
state O
government O
and O
no O
longer O
lived O
. O

Glogowski B-PER
attached O
particular O
importance O
to O
the O
last O
information O
, O
because O
in O
this O
case O
the O
informant O
not O
only O
reported O
on O
hearsay O
, O
but O
on O
his O
own O
knowledge O
and O
had O
burdened O
himself O
with O
it O
. O

In O
the O
conflicts O
between O

there O
is O
now O
a O
new O
topic O
: O

One O
disputes O

argues O
, O
has O
always O
been O
led O
and O
paid O
by O
Lower O
Saxony B-LOC

That O
is O
why O
the O

For O
the O

it O
was O
convenient O
to O
declare O
some O
of O
their O
activities O
as O
work O
for O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Office I-ORG
. O

This O
also O
included O
all O

in O

of O

for O

He O
is O
not O

with O
the O
result O

Schaper B-PER
just O
wanted O
to O
make O
himself O
important O
, O
he O
says O
. O

The O

nothing O
