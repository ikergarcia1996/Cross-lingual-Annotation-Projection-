The O

Declaration I-MISC
, O
adopted O
at O

UN I-MISC

, O
over O

It O
is O
a O
success O
of O
the O
UN B-MISC

, O
which O
the O
South O
can O
account O
for O
, O
that O
the O
moral O
pressure O
on O
the O
North O
has O
grown O
to O
put O
its O
level O

. O

Here O
also O
speaks O
the O
Bonn B-MISC
environment O
minister O
Klaus B-PER
Töpfer I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
that O
we O
are O
“ O
living O
above O
our O
ecological O
conditions O
” O
and O
sitting O
on O
a O
“ O

Indeed O
, O
the O
dream O
of O
the O
Western O
lifestyle O
as O
a O
land O
of O
individual O
happiness O
is O
still O
on O
a O
global O
triumph O

But O
at O
the O

time O
, O
there O
is O
a O
growing O
perception O
that O
it O
is O
not O
an O
ecologically O
viable O
model O
. O

A O
global O
generalization O
of O
the O
per O

consumption O
of O
the O

nations O
would O
lead O
to O
the O
imminent O

Without O

in O
the O

, O
a O

How O
high O
or O

it O
? O

The O
Dutch B-MISC
organization O
Environment O
Defense B-ORG
assumes O
for O
every O
person O
an O
equal O
size O
“ O
environmental O
space O
” O
that O
can O
be O
used O
and O
polluted O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
global O
equality O
principle O
, O
it O
calculates O
that O
the O
citizens O
of O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
exceed O
their O
MPs O
in O
water O
by O
32 O
percent O
, O
energy O
consumption O
, O
carbon O

and O

, O
and O
meat O
and O
aluminum O
consumption O
by O
60 O
to O
80 O
percent O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
considers O
it O
possible O
in O
many O
areas O
of O
everyday O
consumption O
, O
alone O
by O
optimizing O
the O
consumption O
of O
raw O
materials O
and O
saving O
in O
the O
production O
process O
, O
through O
better O
repair O
and O
recycling O
techniques O
and O

in O
the O

areas O

: O

Therefore O
, O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
earth O

capacity O
have O
been O
exceeded O
to O
such O
an O
extent O
that O
incisive O

are O
inevitable O
. O

Without O
a O
change O
in O

, O
according O
to O
the O
Wuppertal B-ORG

for I-ORG
Climate I-ORG
, O
Environment O

, O
we O
can O
not O
: O

The O
" O

of O
Western O

, O
that O
an O
infinite O
growth O
of O

is O
possible O
despite O
finite O
resources O
, O
must O
be O
slaughtered O
. O

The O
Environment O
Institute O
therefore O
wants O
to O
develop O
a O
“ O
new O
model O
of O
prosperity O
” O
in O
which O
values O
such O
as O
“ O

” O
and O
“ O

” O
are O
redefined O
and O
“ O
ascetism O
” O
is O
given O
a O
positive O
meaning O
. O

Environmental B-ORG
Defense I-ORG
assumes O
that O
it O
is O
a O
politically O
difficult O
and O
lengthy O
task O
to O
move O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
population O
to O
reduce O
consumer O
demands O
. O

The O
question O
is O
how O
the O
acceptance O
of O
a O
different O
idea O
of O
" O
good O
life O
" O
can O
be O
imposed O
in O
small O
steps O
. O

Currently O
, O
consumer O
organisations O
work O
primarily O
as O
catalysts O
for O
ecologizing O
consumer O
behavior O
. O

They O
rely O
on O
the O
power O
of O
consumers O
, O
which O
can O
be O
exercised O
with O
the O
shopping O
cart O
, O
but O
also O
by O
giving O
up O
buying O
. O

Contrary O
to O
the O
information O
policy O
of O
traditional O
consumer O
associations O
, O
which O
aims O
solely O
at O
price O
and O
quality O
transparency O
of O
products O
, O
they O
are O
concerned O
with O
the O
consequences O
of O
buying O
and O
consuming O
, O
in O
critical O
cases O
they O
also O
advocate O
for O
boycott O
. O

The O
first O
step O
was O
to O
make O
environmental O
performance O
the O
purchase O
criterion O
. O

The O
U.S. B-LOC
consumer O
movement O
has O
already O
included O
environmental O
standards O
in O
its O
list O
of O
criteria O
for O
buying O
decisions O
years O
ago O
. O

Under O
the O
motto O
“ O
shopping O
for O
a O
better O
world O
” O
it O
covered O
topics O
ranging O
from O
animal O
welfare O
to O
air O
pollution O
. O

Thus O
, O
a O
public O
campaign O
against O
the O
predatory O
methods O
of O
tuna O
fishing O
forced O
the O
largest O
producers O
of O
boxfish O
to O
purchase O
their O
goods O
only O
from O
fishing O
fleets O
that O
do O
not O

WEN B-ORG
makes O

that O
“ O

even O
“ O

” O
– O
for O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
“ O

has O
been O
good O
for O

. O

Manufacturers O
have O
jumped O
to O
the O
ecological O

are O
a O

. O

However O
, O
ecological O

such O
as O
Blue B-MISC

do O
not O
reduce O

. O

At O
best O
, O
they O
reduce O

make O
it O
more O
manageable O

They O
do O
not O
replace O
the O

This O
is O
why O
the O

However O
, O
the O

last O

swept O
the O
tongue O
of O
many O

It O
’s O
too O
early O
to O
see O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
capital O
market O
out O
of O
the O
cutting O
edge O
again O
. O

Two O
conditions O
for O
this O
are O
indispensable O
: O

Corporate O
profits O
should O
not O
fall O
further O
, O
and O
financial O
institutions O
must O
find O
a O
viable O
solution O
to O
manage O
their O
default O

. O

There O
are O
considerable O
doubts O
on O
both O
points O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

Surveys O
clearly O
show O
that O
the O
industry O
has O
to O
further O
reduce O
its O
yield O
expectations O
for O
the O
current O
year O
, O
after O
heavy O
losses O
were O
already O
recorded O
in O
1991 O
. O

Especially O
the O
successful O
electronics O
companies O
are O
afraid O
of O
further O
theft O
. O

Even O
worse O
is O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
metal O
industry O
. O

Nippon B-ORG
Steel I-ORG
, O
for O
example O
, O
expects O
a O
60 O
percent O

in O

. O

As O
long O
as O
no O
one O

it O

In O
the O
face O
of O
the O
depressive O
mood O
, O
Finance O
Minister O
Hata B-PER
did O
not O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
instruct O
his O
colleagues O
on O
a O
costly O
twelve O

point O
aid O
program O
. O

One O
must O
first O
restore O
confidence O
in O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
banking O
system O
, O
is O
its O
justification O
for O
official O
generosity O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
government O
encourages O
banks O
, O
insurance O
companies O
and O
land O
firms O
to O
form O
a O
joint O
real O

fund O
with O
state O
aid O
. O

With O
the O
money O
out O
of O
it O
could O
be O
financed O
the O
purchase O
of O
those O

that O
are O
now O
practically O
hanging O

as O
collateral O
for O

We O

talking O
about O
a O
necessary O

35 O

How O
the O
Monopoly B-MISC
game I-MISC
is O
going O
to O
run O
, O
remains O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

One O
thing O
is O
clear O
today O
. O

Given O
the O
high O
- O
risk O
real O
estate O
market O
and O
the O
empty O
treasures O
of O
institutional O
investors O
, O
only O
the O
state O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
potential O
land O
buyer O
. O

The O
taxpayer O
is O
doomed O
to O
pay O
the O
bill O
for O
the O
unprecedented O
land O
speculation O
of O
the O
1980s O
. O

But O
not O
enough O
generosity O
. O

The O
stock O
market O
shock O
moved O
Nippon B-LOC
's I-LOC
nervous O
government O
to O
further O
concessions O
. O

In O
some O
ways O
, O
banks O
are O
allowed O
to O
recognize O
their O
balance O
sheets O
by O
the O
state O
. O

With O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Finance O
, O
the O
depreciation O
of O
their O
share O
losses O
is O
postponed O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
current O
fiscal O
year O
on O
March O
31 O
, O
1993 O
, O
and O
thus O
first O
disappears O
from O
the O
books O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
institutions O
will O
be O
allowed O
to O
lend O
money O
to O
their O
clients O
at O
interest O
rates O
below O
the O
current O
discount O
rate O
of O
3.25 O
percent O
. O

The O
government O
still O
feeds O
this O
undermining O
of O
monetary O
policy O
through O
tax O
rejection O

openly O
reject O
any O
possibility O
that O

Manfred B-PER

did O
not O
imagine O
this O

He O
wanted O
“ O

to O
leave O
Wiesbaden B-LOC

to O
resign O
his O
Landtag O
mandate O
and O
then O
to O

all O

what O

occupied O
him O
for O

anyway O
: O

Working O
at O
the O
garbage O
recyclers O
of O
the O
“ O

in O
Bonn B-LOC

where O
his O
former O

Frankfurt B-MISC
, O
Wolfram B-PER
Brück I-PER

was O
also O
disposed O
of O
. O

Manfred B-PER
Sutter I-PER
now O
becomes O
the O
executive O
director O
there O
, O
and O
the O
Union O
recently O
released O
once O
again O
the O
highest O
praise O
on O
its O

. O

" O
Per O
somewhat O
easy O
- O
to O
- O
do O
" O
( O
Sutter B-PER
) O
the O
divorcing O
man O
had O
not O
worried O
so O
far O
about O
a O
legal O
problem O
related O
to O
a O
largely O
neglected O
decision O
in O
the O
last O
days O
of O
the O
former O
state O
government O
under O
Walter B-PER
Wallmann I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
. O

Wallmann B-PER
had O
refused O
, O
not O
only O
to O
the O
joy O
of O
all O
concerned O
, O
to O
dismiss O
his O
secretaries O
of O
state O
shortly O
before O
the O
change O
of O
government O
and O
to O
guarantee O
the O
“ O
political O
officials O
” O
75 O
percent O
of O
their O
salaries O
for O
five O
years O
. O

Five O
of O
the O
former O
CDU B-MISC
secretaries I-MISC
of O
state O
( O
including O
Sutter B-PER
) O
belong O
to O
the O
new O
Landtag O
, O
but O
were O
therefore O
automatically O
deputies O
from O
5 O
April O
1991 O
and O
also O
automatically O
allowed O
as O
secretaries O
of O
state O
- O
but O
not O
dismissed O
. O

So O
it O
comes O
that O
the O
current O
CDU B-MISC
MPs I-MISC
Otti B-PER
Geschka I-PER
, O
Reinhold B-PER
Stanitzek I-PER
, O
Gerald B-PER
Weiß I-PER
, O
Volker B-PER
Bouffier I-PER
and O
Manfred B-PER
Sutter I-PER
are O
no O
longer O
state O
secretaries O
, O
but O
they O
would O
actually O
be O
again O
after O
leaving O
the O
parliament O
. O

This O
has O
led O
to O
hectic O
checks O
in O
the O
depths O
of O
official O
law O
since O
the O
announcement O
that O
Sutter B-PER
will O
resign O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
month O
. O

Would O
the O
red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
government O
posthumously O
dismiss O
Sutter B-PER
( O
and O
thereby O
provide O
him O
with O
a O
75 O
percent O
retirement O
salary O
) O
? O

Would O
she O
even O
let O
the O
CDU B-MISC
man I-MISC
work O
in O
the O
red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
cabinet O
? O

Some O
already O
joke O
that O
the O
refugee O
accommodation O
is O
still O
looking O
for O
a O
man O
with O
administrative O
experience O
- O
and O
did O
n't O
Walter B-PER
Wallmann I-PER
have O
two O
SPD B-MISC
secretaries I-MISC
temporarily O
continue O
to O
work O
? O

So O
far O
the O
red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
love O
of O
Sutter B-PER
does O
not O
seem O
to O
go O
: O

Such O
considerations O
have O
encountered O
" O
party O
- O
political O
boundaries O
" O
, O
says O
government O
spokesman O
Erich B-PER
Stather I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
, O
who O
otherwise O
can O
not O
yet O
say O
what O
solution O
is O
now O
being O
found O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
it O
should O
be O
one O
that O
would O
then O
apply O
to O
the O
other O
four O
dismissed O
CDU B-MISC
secretaries I-MISC
of O
state O
someday O
. O

After O
the O
quick O
farewell O
declarations O
for O
the O
MP O
Sutter B-PER
, O
the O
State O
Secretary O
Sutter B-PER
must O
therefore O
be O
discussed O
once O
again O
between O
all O
the O
parties O
involved O
this O
week O
. O

The O
Secretary O
of O
State O
has O
a O
six O
- O
month O
decision O
- O
making O
period O
after O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
Member O
. O

Then O
he O
can O
either O
apply O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
become O
Secretary O
of O
State O
again O
( O
which O
would O
force O
the O
red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
government O
to O
decide O
) O
. O

Because O
he O
already O
works O
in O
Bonn B-LOC
, O
this O
is O
unlikely O
. O

Or O
he O
is O
applying O
for O
the O
dismissal O
himself O
, O
with O
which O
he O
would O
have O
retirement O
rights O
only O
at O
the O
age O
that O
75 O
percent O
immediately O
fell O
away O
. O

But O
even O
this O
is O
grey O
, O
too O
simple O
theory O
: O

In O
this O
case O
( O
luckily O
for O
Sutter B-PER
) O
, O
it O
is O
actually O
not O
about O
75 O
percent O
, O
but O
only O
less O
than O
ten O
percent O
: O

The O
49 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
was O
a O
long O
- O
time O
administrative O
officer O
, O
associate O
officer O
at O
the O
German B-ORG
Landkreistag I-ORG
and O
from O
1987 O
to O
1989 O
social O
centurion O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
. O

There O
he O
was O
elected O
in O
1987 O
for O
six O
years O
until O
1993 O
and O
thus O
even O
as O
a O
Landtag O
Deputy O
still O
had O
ongoing O
benefits O
from O
funds O
of O
the O
City B-LOC
of I-LOC
Frankfurt I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
why O
he O
received O
fewer O
deputies O
- O
diets O
accordingly O
: O

A O
truly O
impenetrable O
thickness O
. O

He O
has O
earned O
a O
high O
retirement O
right O
in O
any O
case O
( O
sutter B-PER
) O
, O
and O
it O
is O
already O
more O
than O
60 O
percent O
of O
his O
last O
active O
salary O
. O

After O
a O
Bonner B-MISC
amendment O
to O
the O
law O
, O
which O
came O
into O
force O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
, O
he O
will O
probably O
also O
have O
to O
have O
his O
income O
in O
the O
dual O
system O
attributed O
to O
such O
pensions O
, O
which O
excludes O
double O
pay O
to O
a O
previously O
known O
extent O
. O

Now O
the O
lawyers O
are O
examining O
who O
has O
to O
pay O
what O
and O
when O
– O
if O
Secretary O
of O
State O
Sutter B-PER
has O
managed O
to O
follow O
Deputy O
Sutter B-PER
to O
Bonn B-LOC
. O

Even O
the O
most O
experienced O
among O
them O
openly O
admit O
that O
they O
had O
not O
yet O
solved O
such O
a O
case O

the O

Rothenburg B-PER
has O
a O
chance O

The O
fields O
would O
be O

Here O

The O

has O
no O
interest O
in O

up O

” O

the O

get O
him O

is O
also O
necessary O
according O

the O
idea O
of O

The O
coastal O

could O
be O
placed O
behind O

With O

in O

it O
is O
asked O
: O

Why O
is O
the O

silent O

Thus O
, O
the O

is O
viewed O

a O
“ O

” O
that O
is O
now O
aimed O
at O
ending O
the O
suffering O
of O
war O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
not O
able O
to O
do O
so O
because O
it O
is O
not O
a O
fixed O
organization O
. O

The O
peace O
movement O
always O
understands O
itself O
as O
a O
spontaneous O
movement O
that O
wants O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
conscience O
of O
the O
politicians O
of O
its O
own O
country O
. O

The O
explanations O
of O
Professor O
Dr. O
Horst O

Eberhard B-PER
Richter I-PER
are O
correct O
, O
but O
also O
unilateral O
, O
because O
they O
disregard O
the O

Power O

A O
year O

, O
the O
Baltics B-LOC
returned O
to O
the O
international O
community O
, O
driven O
by O
a O
wave O
of O
sympathy O
from O
the O
West B-LOC
, O
which O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
sympathy O
for O
oppressed O
small O
states O
, O
was O
primarily O
based O
on O
bad O
conscience O
: O

Bad O
conscience O
, O
because O
the O
West B-LOC
had O
removed O
from O
the O
memory O
for O
fifty O
years O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
republics O
annexed O
by O
Stalin O
; O
bad O
conscience O
, O
but O
also O
because O
in O
1991 O
he O
still O
fluently O
ignored O
the O
plea O
of O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
states O
to O
recognize O
their O
independence O
and O
unilaterally O
put O
Gorbachev B-PER
on O
the O
map O
, O
until O
the O
coup O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
created O
new O
realities O
. O

Then O
everything O
went O
very O
quickly O
. O

While O
the O
self O
- O
proclaimed O
junta O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
was O
still O
crawling O
to O
power O
, O
Latvia B-LOC
and O
Estonia B-LOC
declared O
their O
independence O
— O
Lithuania B-LOC
had O
already O
taken O
this O
step O
in O
February O
— O
and O
two O
weeks O
later O
the O
whole O
world O
had O
recognized O
the O
return O
of O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
states O
. O

Even O
the O
Soviet B-MISC
leadership I-MISC
, O
which O
still O
existed O
, O
although O
effectively O
disempowered O
, O
no O
longer O
resisted O
the O
pursuit O
of O
freedom O
. O

However O
, O
the O
expectations O
that O
people O
from O
Vilnius B-LOC
to O
Tallinn B-LOC
, O
from O
Memel B-LOC
to O
Narva B-LOC
, O
put O
into O
the O
national O
rebirth O
have O
not O
been O
fulfilled O
. O

It O
is O
easier O
to O
political O
independence O
than O
to O
unleash O
economic O
dependencies O
. O

The O
difficult O
introduction O
of O
the O
market O
economy O
has O
brought O
only O
a O
few O
winners O
and O
many O
losers O
in O
the O
Baltic B-LOC
countries I-LOC
so O
far O
, O
and O
means O
unaccessible O
prices O
and O
decreasing O
standard O
of O
living O
for O
most O
. O

The O
hopes O
for O
massive O
aid O
and O
lively O
trade O
exchanges O
with O
the O
West B-LOC
have O
remained O
unsatisfied O
. O

The O
sympathy O
bonus O
that O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
states O
a O
year O
ago O
has O
largely O
flown O
away O
. O

Now O
they O
are O
only O
three O
of O
many O
new O
states O
calling O
for O
help O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
relations O
with O
the O
big O
Russian B-MISC
neighbor O
are O
deteriorating O
. O

The O
times O
have O
passed O
when O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
Democrats O
was O
also O
that O
of O
Boris B-PER
Yeltsin I-PER
. O

Now O
the O
Baltics B-LOC
are O
facing O
Russian B-MISC
economic O
retaliation O
and O
accusations O
of O
discriminating O
against O
the O
Russian B-MISC
minorities O
in O
the O
Baltics O
. O

The O
once O
Soviet B-MISC
and O
now O
Russian B-MISC
army O
still O
sits O
in O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
garrisons O
and O
thus O
remains O
a O
threat O
to O
independence O
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
new O
reactionary O
coup O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
. O

And O
the O
Baltics B-LOC
must O
refrain O
from O
back O
- O
covering O
from O
the O
West I-LOC
, O
because O
as O
once O
Gorbachev B-PER
now O
builds O
on O
Yeltsin B-PER
and O
does O
not O
want O
to O
cause O
inconvenience O
to O
the O
Russian B-MISC
president O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
Baltic B-MISC
States O
feel O
abandoned O
one O
year O
after O
their O
victory O
in O
the O
struggle O
for O
freedom O
. O

Instead O
of O
helping O
to O
build O
a O
democracy O
following O
the O
Western B-MISC
model O
, O
there O
is O
tadel O
when O
they O
violate O
democratic O
values O
: O

because O
of O
their O
minority O
policy O
, O
because O
of O
the O
observance O
of O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
because O
of O
the O
rehabilitation O
of O
Nazi B-MISC
criminals I-MISC
. O

The O
accusations O
are O
justified O
. O

But O
the O
scale O
with O
which O
the O
Baltics B-LOC
are O
measured O
does O
not O
suit O
peoples O
who O
had O
been O
oppressed O
for O
half O
a O
century O
and O
had O
only O
first O
learned O
about O
democracy O
. O

A O
little O
more O
patience O
and O
understanding O
would O
be O
needed O
. O

After O
50 O
years O
of O
foreign O
rule O
, O
the O
Baltics B-LOC
now O
want O
to O
be O
masters O
in O
their O
own O
house O
. O

Is O
it O
so O
difficult O
to O
understand O
? O

Having O
previously O
had O
to O
communicate O
with O
the O
authorities O
in O
their O
own O
country O
in O
a O
foreign O
language O
, O
they O
now O
demand O
that O
everyone O
who O
holds O
a O
public O
office O
understand O
their O
language O
. O

Is O
it O
inappropriate O
? O

The O
hardly O
criticized O
Estonian O
Citizenship O
Act O
, O
which O
requires O
a O
minimum O
stay O
of O
two O
years O
and O
certain O
language O
skills O
, O
is O
not O
discriminatory O
, O
but O
extremely O
liberal O
: O

It O
is O
much O
easier O
for O
non B-MISC

Estonians I-MISC
to O
become O
Estonians O
than O
to O
become O
Germans B-MISC
or O
Swedes B-MISC

or O

It O
is O
also O
understandable O
that O
Estonia B-LOC
will O
only O
allow O
Estonian O
citizens O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
upcoming O

However O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
forty O

Estonia I-MISC

the O

the O
Baltic B-MISC
dilemma O
: O

Should O
the O
injustice O
of O
the O

and O
settlement O
policy O
now O
be O
compensated O
by O
the O
disadvantage O

people O
who O
have O
come O
to O
the O
Baltics B-LOC
without O
their O

fault O
as O
a O

this O

Tens O

thousands O

the O

where O
they O
were O
born O

There O
is O

anything O

Is O
n’t O
the O
problem O

that O
it O
is O
deeply O
contrary O

The O

Amidst O

at O
the O
time O
seemed O
very O
aggressive O
to O
me O
on O
the O
level O
of O
concrete O

and O
what O
I O
experienced O
during O
the O

from O

the O
Afghans B-MISC
were O
the O
most O
friendly O

people O
- O
as O
far O
as O
you O
can O
judge O
as O

an O

existed O
when O

but O
not O

and O
a O
advocate O
of O
the O
Enlightenment O
( O
which O
was O
originally O
anti O

religious O
) O
, O
I O
considered O
the O
Afghan B-MISC
world O
of O
life O
and O
the O
variant O
of O
Islam B-MISC
as O
the O
least O
inhuman O
and O
oppressive O

One O
was O
also O
tolerated O
here O
as O

unlike O

Pakistan B-LOC
- O
quite O
apart O
of O

from O
the O
Hindu B-MISC

. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
Afghanistan B-LOC
seemed O
to O
be O
an O
Islamic B-MISC
country O
, O
in O
which O
one O
could O
quite O
imagine O
, O
for O
example O
, O
to O
work O
and O
live O
as O
a O
doctor O
for O
a O
while O
. O

While O
I O
still O
reluctantly O
welcomed O
the O
establishment O
of O
Taraki B-LOC
by O
Soviet B-MISC
support O
– O
I O
must O
admit O
– O
in O
1978 O
as O
an O
opportunity O
for O
secularizing O
and O
“ O
enlightening O
” O
policy O
and O
social O
change O
, O
I O
was O
bitter O
about O
the O
Soviet B-MISC
invasion O
of O
Christmas O
1978 O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
Afghanistan B-LOC
would O
never O
be O

way O
I O
had O
seen O
it O
before O
, O
even O
if O
the O

were O
to O
be O

. O

When O
a O
country O
is O
so O
long O
occupied O
and O
brutally O
fought O
by O
a O
power O
completely O
alien O
to O
it O
, O
with O
which O
there O
is O
no O
identification O
, O
a O
culture O
and O
the O
world O
of O
life O
must O
be O
damaged O
. O

Afghanistan B-LOC
’s I-LOC
centuries O
- O
long O
delicate O

would O
then O
be O
destroyed O
, O
even O
by O
the O
inevitable O
influence O
of O
“ O
Western O
interventions O
, O
” O
as O
you O
write O
. O

When O
, O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
after O
the O
initially O
welcomed O
overthrow O
of O
the O
Shah O
, O
it O
became O
clear O
what O
one O
had O
to O
think O
of O
an O
" O
Islamic B-MISC
state O
" O
, O
it O
was O
to O
fear O
that O
this O
could O
threaten O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
after O
a O
victory O
of O
the O
Mujaheddin O
. O

That O
is O
, O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
the O
few O
secular O
sides O
of O
Afghan B-MISC
society O
would O
likely O
be O
taken O
back O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
there O
was O
a O
quiet O
( O
? O

Inner O
- O
Afghan O
decision O
on O
further O
social O
development O
became O
impossible O
. O

Although O
this O
decision O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
made O
, O
it O
must O
now O
emerge O
from O
a O
catastrophic O
civil O
war O
of O
the O
disputed O
peoples O
, O
rather O
than O
triumphing O
together O
over O
the O
defeat O
of O
the O
aggressor O
. O

You O
described O
this O
terrible O
situation O
very O
well O
for O
me O
now O
in O
your O
editorial O
article O
. O

It O
is O
unfortunately O
true O
, O
" O
that O
military O
intervention O
creates O
infinitely O
more O
problems O
than O
its O
authors O
hope O
to O
solve O
... O

and O
ultimately O
destroy O
those O
on O
whom O
the O
interventions O
believe O
they O
can O
rely O
. O
” O

I O
find O
the O
following O
two O
sentences O
important O
: O

With O
them O
also O
goes O
down O
the O
social O
utopia O
that O
once O
led O
them O
to O
act O
. O

The O
contradictions O
in O
the O
country O
remain O
unresolved O
and O
become O
destructive O
. O
” O

I O
think O
that O
’s O
what O
makes O
such O
an O
imperialist O
act O
so O
hateful O

when O

considerably O

Even O

the O
many O

like O
Lufthansa B-ORG
, O
such O
proposals O
appear O
short O
- O
sighted O
, O
but O
they O
simply O
clamp O
out O
the O
consequent O
costs O
. O

Can O
a O
worker O
who O
wants O
to O
work O
longer O
but O
gets O
less O
money O
for O
it O
seriously O
expect O
an O
increased O
motivation O
to O
pull O
the O
cart O
out O
of O

through O
extraordinary O

? O

This O
contradicts O
all O
the O
principles O
of O
modern O
business O
psychology O
. O

There O
may O
be O
top O
earners O
at O
Lufthansa B-ORG

resulting O
from O
better O
times O
. O

There O
can O
be O
limitations O
, O
but O
the O
majority O
of O
employees O
must O
also O
count O
on O
the O
mark O
in O
the O
case O
of O
rising O
cost O
of O
living O
. O

When O
there O
is O
even O
less O
money O
then O
existential O
worries O
and O
troubles O
arise O
that O
are O
anything O
other O
than O
performance O
- O
stimulating O
. O

This O
is O
devastating O
for O
a O
service O
company O
that O
lives O
on O
the O
commitment O
of O
its O
employees O
to O
the O
customer O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
it O
is O
questionable O
whether O
the O
whisper O
of O
the O
dead O
bells O
everywhere O
is O
not O
already O
demotivating O
for O
Lufthansa B-ORG

As O
a O
passenger O
, O
however O
, O
I O
am O
interested O
in O
being O
optimally O
advised O
by O
ground O
personnel O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
and O
being O
able O
to O
enjoy O
a O
good O
service O
during O
the O
flight O
. O

This O
is O
guaranteed O
only O
by O
motivated O
, O
competent O
and O
open O
- O
minded O
employees O
. O

Wage O
cuts O
and O
worse O
working O
conditions O
have O
never O
contributed O
to O
this O
. O

However O
, O
when O
the O
offer O
is O
no O
longer O
attractive O
, O
the O
customer O
goes O
to O
the O
competition O
that O
offers O
these O
conditions O
. O

The O
resulting O
economic O
damage O
would O
probably O
be O
greater O
than O
the O
expected O
500 O
million O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
hoped O
that O
the O

better O
the O
whole O

the O
public O

the O

” O

that O

I O

That O
worked O
, O
” O
said O
the O
HSV B-MISC
coach I-MISC
. O

Until O
the O
84th O
minute O
, O
however O
, O
he O
had O
to O
fear O
for O
his O
men O
. O

In O
the O
attack O
, O
it O
did O
n’t O
work O
out O
at O
all O

for O
a O
few O

20 O

, O
” O
the O

also O
explained O

He O
thought O
primarily O
of O

of O
Dirk B-PER
Zander I-PER
, O
who O
struck O
against O
the O

in O
the O
56th O
minute O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
Dynamo O
, O
however O
, O
was O
not O
necessarily O
due O
to O
the O
poor O
use O
of O
opportunities O
, O
but O
much O
more O
to O
the O
fear O

himself O
for O

in O

the O
VfB B-ORG
achieved O
the O
400th O

victory I-MISC
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O

The O
Swabians O
showed O
that O
the O
path O
to O
the O

is O
likely O
to O
go O
through O
Stuttgart B-LOC
again O
this O

“ O
It O

” O

The O
club O
, O
which O
also O
failed O
to O
score O
in O
the O
second O

is O
already O
in O

" O
At O
the O

, O
we O

As O
for O
Coach O
Daum B-PER
: O

“ O
I O
played O
the O
game O
two O
or O
three O
times O
in O
my O
dream O
tonight O

” O

The O
result O
was O
a O
tactical O
variant O
, O
in O
which O

against O

Thus O
, O
Buchwald B-PER
, O
Kögl B-PER
, O
Gaudino B-PER
and O
Golke B-PER
alternately O
joined O
the O
attack O
game O
with O
Walter B-PER
. O

This O
confused O
the O
defense O
of O
the O
Franks B-ORG
so O
much O
that O
the O
two O
hits O
of O
Fritz B-PER
Walter I-PER
were O
almost O
the O
logical O
consequence O
. O

The O
Stuttgarter B-MISC
goalkeeper O
had O
been O
handed O
over O
before O
the O

with O
the O

by O

: O

“ O

In O
the O
midfield O
, O
Andre B-PER
Golke I-PER
practically O
forgot O
the O
departure O
of O
Matthias B-PER

Willi B-PER
Entenmann I-PER
praised O
his O
former O

after O
the O
game O
: O

“ O
This O
is O
a O
superplayer O

” O

However O
, O
Entenmann B-PER
made O
a O
tactical O
mistake O
by O
putting O
the O
beaten O
Friedmann B-PER
against O
the O
quirky O
Walter B-PER
. O

You O
only O
come O
when O
I O
’ve O
played O
badly O
, O
” O
the O
Nuremberg B-MISC
became O
upset O
after O
the O
game O
and O
refused O
all O
questions O
. O

The B-LOC

is O
in O
a O
tough O
time O

The O
weakened O

The O

was O
apparently O
disappointed O

“ O
We O

” O

The O

puts O
on O
the O

effect O
as O
in O
the O
previous O

, O
when O

the O
crucial O

And O
Jorginho B-PER

“ O

” O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
Vice O

an O

Coach O
Erich B-PER
Ribbeck I-PER
saw O
the O

less O
positive O
. O

Not O
everyone O

in O
the O
best O

” O
he O
said O

In O
the O
second O

the O

were O
no O

able O
to O
keep O
their O

Probably O
also O
because O

You O

not O
just O

, O
” O
Zobel B-PER
, O

previously O

: O

“ O
We O

If O

not O

the O

Lothar B-PER

also O
make O

The O

” O

Matthäus B-PER

from O

it O
was O
clear O
to O

: O

" O
A O

between O

When O
asked O
whether O
the O

wanted O
to O
provoke O
the O
release O
of O

, O
where O
he O
, O
like O

replied O
: O

“ O
The O

” O

At O
FC B-ORG
Bayern I-ORG
, O
Matthäus B-PER
could O
give O
additional O
stops O

Hoeneß B-PER

it O
is O
also O
going O

For O

, O
the O

sense O
. O

If O
he O

again O

he O
would O

While O
the O
emergency O

announced O
by O
the O

government O
catapulted O
the O
Nikkei B-MISC
stock I-MISC
index I-MISC
up O
more O
than O
13 O
percent O
last O
week O
, O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
experienced O
a O
price O
crash O
on O
Friday O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
: O

The O
decline O
of O
the O
dollar O
. O

At O
1.40 O
mark O
, O
it O
reached O
a O
historic O
low O
on O
Friday O
in O
New B-MISC

City O
. O

Not O
even O
five O
international O
central O
bank O
interventions O
were O
able O
to O
prevent O
the O
collapse O
. O

The O
fall O
of O
the O
Greenback B-MISC
brought O
the O
stock O
market O
into O
turmoil O
. O

After O
a O
fixed O
opening O
, O
the O
Dow B-MISC
Jones I-MISC
index I-MISC
fell O
by O
well O
over O
50 O
points O
to O
3254.10 O
. O

The O
bond O
prices O
were O
also O
under O
pressure O
. O

There O
are O
two O
main O
reasons O
for O
the O
decline O
of O
the O
dollar O
: O

The O
weak O
U.S. B-MISC
economy I-MISC
and O
the O
high O
interest O
rate O
difference O
with O
Germany B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
the O
trigger O
for O
the O
recent O
downturn O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
markets O
’ O
distrust O
of O
the O
Bush B-MISC
administration I-MISC
’s O
economic O
policies O
and O
the O
vague O
economic O
policy O
formulations O
of O
Democratic O
candidate O
Bill B-PER
Clinton I-PER
. O

In O
his O
highly O
anticipated O
speech O
at O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Republican B-MISC
Congress O
in O
Houston B-LOC
, O
Texas B-LOC
, O
President O
Bush B-PER
announced O
that O
in O
the O
event O
of O
his O
re O
- O
election O
he O
would O
propose O
tax O
cuts O
, O
provided O
that O
they O
would O
be O
paid O
by O
targeted O
spending O
cuts O
. O

Despite O
this O
condition O
, O
this O
immediately O
triggered O
warning O
signals O
in O
the O
financial O
markets O
, O
fearing O
an O
expansion O
of O
the O
budget O
deficit O
. O

Until O
now O
, O
the O
long O
stock O
market O
upsurge O
in O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
had O
been O
lived O
mainly O
by O
the O
army O
of O
retail O
investors O
who O
had O
switched O
to O
stocks O
due O
to O
the O
low O
interest O
rate O
of O
their O
savings O
. O

This O
policy O
has O
especially O
benefited O
the O
banks O
, O
which O
can O
clean O
up O
their O
balances O
with O
the O
blatant O
difference O
between O
debt O
and O
holding O
interest O
rates O
. O

Many O
money O
houses O
had O
speculated O
in O
the O
real O
estate O
business O
in O
the O
Reagan B-MISC
years I-MISC
. O

Against O
the O
ongoing O
economic O
weakness O
, O
low O
interest O
rates O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
are O
increasingly O
proving O
to O
be O
a O
dumb O
weapon O
. O

Beneficiaries O
of O
the O
low O
interest O
rates O
are O
also O
the O
state O
itself O
, O
whose O
debt O
service O
is O
thus O
decreasing O
. O

After O
all O
, O
they O
made O
up O
the O
third O
- O
largest O
item O
in O
the O
budget O
in O
July O
, O
whose O
deficit O
rose O
to O
$ O
44.6 O
billion O
last O
month O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
budget O
deficit O
in O
the O
first O
ten O
months O
of O
the O
fiscal O
year O
ending O
on O
September O
30 O
is O
already O
higher O

at O

no O

draw O

attention O
of O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxony I-MISC
Ministry O
of O
Internal B-ORG

to O
the O
strange O
agency O
activity O
of O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxony I-MISC
official O
Boinowitz B-PER
, O
of O
which O
he O
had O
learned O
through O
Schaper B-PER
’s O
notes O
. O

In O
the O
fierce O
word O
struggles O
of O
the O
last O
days O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxony I-MISC
side O
also O
had O
to O
give O
up O
some O
questions O
: O

Why O
had O
the O
Hannover B-MISC
Constitutional O
Protection O
Office O
, O
when O
it O
believed O
to O
have O
received O
annoying O
information O
about O
a O
Saxon B-MISC
- I-MISC
Anhaltine I-MISC
minister O
, O
not O
addressed O
him O
himself O
? O

Or O
the O
head O
of O
government O
? O

Or O
the O
special O
commission O
set O
up O
by O
the O
Magdeburg B-MISC
Landtag O
to O
review O
the O
deputies O
? O

Or O
the O
Gauck B-MISC
authority I-MISC
? O

Would O
n’t O
it O
even O
have O
been O
best O
to O
turn O
the O
information O
right O
through O
the O
scratchwolf O
because O
of O
low O
quality O
? O

These O
questions O
became O
even O
more O
urgent O
when O
Interior O
Minister O
Glogowski B-PER
, O
in O
his O
response O
to O
a O
request O
from O
the O
FDP B-ORG
, O
said O
that O
in O
the O
interrogation O
of O
the O
former O
Stasi B-MISC
officer I-MISC
there O
were O
indications O
of O
other O
East O
German B-MISC
politicians O
as O
well O
as O
of O
a O
West B-MISC
German I-MISC
who O
had O
been O
a O
member O
of O
a O
state O
government O
and O
was O
no O
longer O
alive O
. O

Glogowski B-PER
attached O
special O
importance O
to O
the O
latest O
information O
, O
because O
in O
this O
case O
the O
informant O
not O
only O
from O
the O
hearing O
, O
but O
from O
his O
own O
knowledge O
and O
he O
himself O
burdened O

The O

Therefore O

the O

For O
the O
Lower B-MISC

it O
was O
convenient O
to O
declare O
some O
of O
their O
activities O
as O

for O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Office I-ORG
. O

This O
also O

for O
which O
the O
Lower B-MISC

not O

It O
was O
only O
about O
three O

that O
the O

informed O
the O

that O

to O
be O

The O
Magdeburg B-MISC

had O
hoped O
for O
a O
professional O

with O
the O

, O
but O
nothing O

This O

One O
of O
the O
essential O
duties O
in O
Muslim B-MISC
communities O
is O
that O
of O
the O
wife O
to O
her O

. O

According O
to O
the O
fourth O
Qur’an B-MISC
: O

The O
virtuous O

obedient O

She O

raise O

It O
prevents O

With O
the O
opposite O

women O
should O
only O

European B-MISC
women O
are O
suffering O
from O
emancipation O
, O
says O
the O
German B-MISC
Muslim O
. O

Their O
power O
struggle O
with O
the O
men O
leads O
to O
“ O
unnecessary O
debates O
in O
which O
the O
family O

scattered O

” O

Gradually O
it O
becomes O
obscure O
to O
the O

that O
the O
encounter O
of O

more O
a O
religious O
rally O

They O
stay O

Irina B-PER
Geipel I-PER
protested O
in O
writing O
, O
in O
the O

of O
the O

community I-LOC
: O

“ O
I O

says O
Wilfried B-PER
Krumpeter I-PER
of O

at O

But O
I O
do O
n’t O
understand O
why O
women O
still O
do O
n’t O
have O
the O
same O
rights O
as O
men O
. O

If O
a O
woman O
does O
not O
enter O
into O
marriage O
, O
she O
is O
usually O
killed O
. O
” O

Hadayatullah B-PER
Hübsch I-PER
contradicts O
: O

“ O
This O
is O
a O
barbaric O
tradition O
that O

nothing O

A O
Christian B-MISC
Turk B-MISC
reminds O
of O
the O
Qur’an B-MISC
’s I-MISC
command I-MISC
to O
kill O
unbelievers O
. O

This O
applies O
only O
in O
the O
war O
, O
corrects O
Hadayatullah B-PER
Hübsch I-PER
. O

The O
discussion O
becomes O
a O
fierce O
dispute O
over O
the O
correct O
Bible B-MISC
and O
Koran B-MISC
exegesis I-MISC
. O

Landrat O
Gnadl B-PER
asks O
concerned O
: O

Are O

a O

Or O
is O
it O
not O
that O

the O
