1992 O
, O
at O

The O
six O
deputies O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
, O
who O
have O
represented O
the O
opposition O
since O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
large O
coalition O
of O
Christian B-ORG
and O
Social B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
, O
had O
apologized O
to O
the O
leader O
Rainer B-PER
Bergert I-PER
for O
their O
absence O
. O

And O
he O
had O
instructed O
half O
a O
dozen O
city O
councillors O
to O
feel O
obliged O
to O
their O
2,500 O
voters O
from O
the O
municipal B-ORG

of O
' O

or O
to O
primarily O
deal O
with O
themselves O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

As O
, O
there O
will O
probably O
no O
longer O
be O
a O
group O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
in O
the O
city O
parliament O
of O
Rodgau O
after O
March O

, O
1993 O
, O
if O
no O

find O
themselves O

in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
mandate O
in O
the O
city B-ORG
council I-ORG
and O
in O
the O
local B-ORG
councils I-ORG
. O

The O
Greens B-ORG
in O
and O
in O
Rodgau B-LOC
had O
therefore O
invited O
for O
Friday O
, O
despite O
the O
plenary O
session O
in O
the O
town O
hall B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
SG B-LOC

, O
to O
undertake O
a O
final O

The O
current O
city O

with O
Dieter B-PER
Ruckriegel I-PER
at O
the O
forefront O
, O
who O
had O
to O
rest O
for O
a O
half O

because O
of O
his O
professional O
training O
, O
are O
no O
longer O
ready O
to O
take O

the O

when O
there O
are O
no O
more O
active O

among O

people O
. O

Without O
the O
Greens B-ORG
in O
their O
midst O
, O
the O
City B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
discharged O
itself O
in O
just O
57 O
minutes O
of O
its O
duty O
to O
negotiate O
an O
agenda O
covering O
almost O
two O
dozen O
points O
in O
the O
public O
part O
. O

There O
were O
only O
three O
real O
topics O
, O
everything O
else O
was O
cut O
off O
without O
discussion O
. O

The O
city O
changed O
its O
waste O
disposal O
on O
Friday O
evening O
, O
with O
the O
collection O
of O
glass O
, O
depleted O
metal O
, O
styroporus O
, O
plastics O
, O
aluminum O
, O
from O

or O
computer O

as O
well O
as O
garden O
waste O
now O
also O
fixed O
in O

. O

The O
magistrate O
will O
examine O
and O
plan O
how O
urban O
sports O
areas O
can O
be O
watered O
in O
an O
environmentally O
friendly O
and O
drinking O
water O
- O
efficient O
manner O
with O
the O
help O
of O
tanks O
. O

In O
this O
context O
, O
Clemens B-PER
Jäger I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
made O
the O
remarkable O
statement O
that O
excessive O
water O
consumption O
must O
be O
avoided O
again O
in O
the O
future O
, O
which O
led O
Karl O
- O
Heinz B-PER
Schönberg I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
to O
the O
equally O
well O
- O
founded O
replica O
that O
one O
must O
handle O
water O
economically O
. O

Especially O
since O
it O
was O
also O
a O
joint O
proposal O
by O
the O
coalitionists O
, O
the O
vote O
was O
clear O
. O

The O
Greens B-ORG
have O
heard O
the O
ears O
. O

Sure O
, O
her O
all O
- O
round O
Christian B-PER
Great I-PER
would O
have O
thought O
of O
a O
few O
more O
words O
, O
and O
because O
he O
was O
missing O
that O
evening O
, O
it O
was O
also O
missed O
somehow O
. O

Then O
there O
was O
still O
the O
new O
city O
cemetery B-MISC
statute I-MISC
to O
be O
discussed O
, O
which O
encouraged O
Karl B-PER
H. I-PER
Erb I-PER
of O
the O
Union B-ORG
and O
Andreas B-PER
Lämmermann I-PER
to O
make O
longer O
statements O
that O
would O
not O
have O
remained O
uncontested O
by O
the O
Greens B-ORG
. O

While O

in O

Summary O
of O
: O

It O
was O
not O
a O
broken O
agenda O
, O
but O
the O
Greens B-ORG
still O
lacked O
some O
political O
opponents O
. O

As O

had O
said O
to O

Anderson B-PER

stiff O
eyes O

more O

could O
not O
imagine O
what O
he O
had O
to O
see O
from O
the O
tribune O
of O
the O
Müngersdorfer B-MISC
Stadium O
. O

Again O
, O
coach O
Stepanovic B-PER
did O
not O
consider O
him O
and O
further O
humiliated O
him O
. O

So O
happened O
in O
the O
84th O
minute O
when O
Axel B-PER
Kruse I-PER
went O
and O
Stefan B-PER
Studer I-PER
took O
his O
position O
next O
to O
Anthony B-PER

That O
was O
the O
absolute O

said O
the O

at O

and O
continued O
: O

“ O
I O

The O
frustration O
sat O
deep O

the O
tongue O
loose O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O

" O
So O
lucky O
we O
have O
not O
had O
the O

the O
29 O

echoed O
about O

to O
immediately O
ease O
his O
anger O
: O

“ O
I O

Indeed O
, O
they O
did O
not O
see O
him O

Certainly O
less O

should O
have O
been O
about O
the O
appearance O
of O

" O

was O
everywhere O

himself O

The O
24 O

stumbled O
like O
ever O
from O

This O
was O
also O
the O
reason O
why O
the O
game O
of O
leg B-PER
was O
much O
more O
offensive O

Again O

again O

Questions O
that O
the O
two O

had O
to O
ask O

Especially O
Illgner B-PER

who O
sticked O
to O
his O

, O
while O
Yeboah B-PER
was O
able O
to O
act O
relentlessly O
in O
the O
five O

One O
who O
is O
no O
longer O
in O

was O
again O
at O

The O
" O
Juventus B-MISC

" O
, O
as O
Stepanovic B-PER
further O
calls O
Andreas B-PER
Möller I-PER
, O
ghosted O
through O
all O
heads O
. O

And O
captain O
Uli B-PER
Stein I-PER
finally O
contained O
in O
words O
what O
many O
thought O
: O

It O
can O
also O
be O
done O
without O
mules B-PER
. O

There O
is O
more O
fighting O
, O
we O
all O
keep O

We O
would O
have O
become O

last O

” O

Another O
clear O
departure O
for O
Möller B-PER
, O
who O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
the O
victory O
no O
one O
cried O
a O
tear O
after O

Per O
Stein B-PER
also O
wanted O
to O
distract O

his O

not O

Twice O
he O

twice O

had O
great O
luck O
not O
to O

Alfons B-PER

placed O
a O

on O

in O

Stein B-PER
tats O
in O
his O
own O
way O
: O

A O
clap O
on O
the O

of O
the O
former O
Aschaffenburger B-MISC

followed O
by O
praising O
words O
about O
his O
" O
very O
good O

" O
. O

The O
Germans B-MISC
should O
have O
won O
even O
higher O
that O
day O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
the O
leg B-PER
offered O
itself O
three O
times O
the O
opportunity O
to O
increase O
. O

Next O
was O
Yeboah B-PER
. O

His O
shot O
from O
20 O
meters O
, O
however O
, O
only O
crashed O
against O
the O

after O
the O
interrupted O
Stefan B-PER

had O
handed O
the O
ball O
in O
a O

Symptomatic O

” O

The O

But O
I O

" O
Stepanovic B-PER

bring O
the O

into O
a O

At O
this O

Particularly O
important O

This O
means O
that O

The O

failure O
to O
start O
: O

" O
We O
had O
to O
build O
six O
new O
players O
, O
which O
takes O
its O
time O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
performers O
like O
Schröder B-PER
and O
Feyen B-PER
have O
long O
been O
injured O
, O
and O
the O
great O
talent O
Michael B-PER
Sauer I-PER
has O
been O
more O
confused O
than O
built O
up O
by O
the O
many O
contacts O
with O
Bundesliga B-MISC
players I-MISC
. O
” O

These O
arguments O
may O
explain O
the O
failed O
start O
of O
this O
season O
, O
but O
there O
are O
other O
questions O
: O

Why O
is O
it O
that O
despite O
prominent O
new O
entries O
in O
the O
last O
three O
years O
, O
the O
SV B-ORG
Wehen I-ORG
has O
regularly O
disappointed O
five O
different O
trainers O
? O

What O
are O
the O
reasons O
why O
players O
like O
Schröder B-PER
, O
Feyen B-PER
, O
Sauer B-PER
or O
Caic B-PER
have O
stagnated O
in O
their O
performance O
since O
they O
are O
at O
the O
SV B-ORG
Wehen I-ORG
? O

The O
reasons O
for O
this O
must O
be O
sought O
in O
the O
structures O
of O
the O
association O
. O

In O
an O
unprecedented O
breakthrough O
from O
1986 O
to O
1989 O
, O
Wehen O
has O
climbed O
from O
the O
A O
- O
Class O
to O
the O
Upper O
League O
, O
retaining O
structures O
that O
have O
proven O
themselves O
in O
the O
lower O
classes O
but O
need O
to O
be O
checked O
for O
an O
ascension O
aspirant O
of O
the O
Upper O
League O
. O

Thus O
, O
some O
players O
who O
have O
shifted O
from O
other O
clubs O
after O
work O
complain O
that O
it O
is O
too O
rural O
, O
too O
familiar O
and O
too O
cozy O
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
you O
get O
used O
to O
the O
loose O
trott O
and O
feel O
very O
comfortable O
in O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

Karlheinz B-PER
Kühn I-PER
admits O
that O
the O
team O
sometimes O
gets O
satisfied O
too O
quickly O
: O

“ O
After O
the O
game O
of O
the O
cup O
against O
the O
unanimity B-ORG
, O
there O
was O
an O
almost O
relaxed O
mood O
in O
our O
team O
, O
although O
with O
more O
self O
- O
criticism O
, O
they O
should O
have O
noticed O
that O
they O
did O
not O
deliver O
the O
unanimity B-ORG
a O
broken O
fight O
. O
” O

As O
not O
optimal O
, O
medical O
care O
is O
also O
considered O
by O
some O
players O
. O

She O
is O
co O
- O
responsible O
for O
15 O
serious O
injuries O
in O
the O
last O
season O
. O

It O
is O
also O
surprising O
that O
Wehen O
, O
the O
only O
top O
club O
in O
the O
upper O
league O
, O
only O
trains O
three O
times O
a O

. O

Open B-MISC
backs I-MISC
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
exercise O
five O
to O
six O
times O
a O

. O

Possibly O
even O
the O
Weehener B-ORG
model O
to O
offer O
players O
in O
the O
operation O
of O
Hankammer B-PER
a O
good O
career O
prospect O
contains O
a O
tricky O
trap O
. O

Will O

father O
( O
the O
average O
age O
of O
the O

when O
he O
sees O
attractive O
opportunities O
for O

in O
the O
Hankammer B-PER
operation O
and O
can O
add O

honorary O
as O
a O
considerable O
boost O
? O

Heinz B-PER
Hankammer I-PER
has O
also O
argued O
about O
such O
questions O
. O

On O
Sunday O
morning O
, O
he O
told O
the O
FR B-ORG
: O

" O
I O
discovered O
a O
certain O
phlegma O
in O
the O
team O
and O
am O
angry O
accordingly O
. O

I O
will O
openly O
discuss O
all O
problems O
with O
the O
team O
at O
a O
dinner O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
think O
is O
for O
sure O
now O
is O
that O
in O
the O
future O
we O
need O
to O
focus O
more O
on O

Not O

because O
the O

had O

more O

Luckily O
, O
because O
the O
newcomer O
in O
the O
Hessic B-MISC
upper O
league O
lacked O
cold O
shyness O
and O
once O
again O
a O
referee O
with O
his O
questionable O
decisions O
took O
significant O
influence O
on O
the O
events O
of O
the O
game O
. O

He O
imposed O
three O
time O
penalties O
( O
all O
against O
Neukirchen B-ORG
) O
, O
ten O
yellow O
cards O
and O
had O
more O
than O
one O
unfortunate O
hand O
with O
his O
eleven O
- O

decisions O
. O

The O
guests O
started O
more O
determined O
and O
should O
have O
led O
already O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
game O
. O

However O
, O
Wendler B-PER
first O
pardoned O
a O
gift O
from O
Walldorf B-ORG
's I-ORG
Libero O
Andreas B-PER
Zwilling I-PER
and O
shortly O
afterwards O
he O
failed O
freestanding O
to O
the O
goalkeeper O
Robert B-PER
Gemeri I-PER
, O
who O
returned O
to O
the O
Walldorf O
squad O
after O
his O
illness O
. O

Only O
then O
came O
the O
hosts O
through O
their O
active O
positions O
Holtkamp B-PER
and O
Ferreiro B-PER
better O
into O
the O
game O
and O
thus O
to O
first O
goal O
opportunities O
. O

However O
, O
Neukirchen B-ORG
's I-ORG
Schlußmann O
Ernst B-PER
was O
able O
to O
prevent O
a O
downturn O
at O
this O
stage O
. O

Shortly O
before O
the O
half O
- O
time O
break O
, O
then O
the O
referee O
's O
old B-LOC
house I-LOC
presented O
his O
first O
- O
questionable O
- O
appearance O
to O
both O
teams O
and O
the O
observers O
. O

Gemeri B-PER
picked O
Müller B-PER
clearly O
from O
the O
legs O
, O
but O
the O
due O
eleven O
- O
meter O
pfiff O
was O
missing O
. O

However O
, O
he O
did O
not O
leave O
his O
pitch O
after O
the O
change O
. O

Because O
the O
impartial O
wanted O
to O
have O
recognized O
a O
foul O
of O
Trageser B-PER
on O
lubricant O
. O

The O
resulting O
eleven O
meter O
was O
used O
by O
Romeo B-PER
Wendler I-PER
to O
guide O
the O
guests O

And O
in O
Twillings O

Englert B-PER

Dieter B-PER

was O
also O
punished O

Then O
followed O
three O
questionable O

punishments O
against O
Neukircher B-ORG

, O
so O
that O
they O
partly O
had O
to O

be O
an O
opportunity O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O

to O
have O
their O

because O
then O
, O
according O

some O

” O
Wolfgang B-PER

the O

to O
the O

over O
the O

The O
Central O
Theme O
: O

The O
fear O
that O
the O
forest O
, O
already O
" O
stretched O
" O
by O
the O
immense O
pollutants O
, O
will O
not O

Another O
eight O

being O
talked O
about O

and O
at O

part O

likely O
to O
be O
used O
by O
the O
city O

for O
its O
drinking O
water O
supply O
: O

As O
a O
security O
, O
when O
the O
wells O
of O
the O
city O
of O
North B-LOC
Hessen I-LOC
can O
no O
longer O
donate O
enough O
water O
. O

On O
the O
side O
of O
those O
who O
are O
massively O
opposed O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Reinhardswald B-LOC
is O
“ O

” O
stands O
Forstamtsleiter O
Norbert B-PER
Teuwsen I-PER

The O

to O

to O

One O
day O
, O
according O
to O
his O
prophecy O
, O
“ O
we O
will O
then O
stand O
before O
the O
ruins O
of O
this O
forest O
. O
” O

To O
date O
, O
the O
180,000 O

About O
the O
many O
light O
sources O
at O
Hombressen B-LOC

From O
them O
the O

of O
Hofgeismar B-LOC

Up O
to O
4,000 O
cubic O
meters O
of O
water O
flows O
from O
these O
sources O
into O
the O
homes O
of O
about O
15,000 O
inhabitants O
. O

And O
because O
( O
also O
) O
they O
consumed O
more O
water O
than O
usual O
in O
the O
summer O
heat O
of O
the O
past O
weeks O
, O
the O
Lempe O

were O
no O
longer O
enough O
. O

An O
emergency O
fountain O
of O
the O
city O
had O
to O
be O
activated O
. O

No O
wonder O
, O
then O
, O
that O
the O
Hofgeismarer B-MISC
try O
to O
prevent O
the O
" O
greep O
of O
the O
Kasseler B-MISC
to O
the O

of O

The O

are O
clear O
: O

“ O
We O
want O
to O
keep O
our O
cake O
, O
” O
says O
Mayor O
Horst B-PER
Buchhaupt I-PER
. O

That O
a O
piece O
of O
the O
cake O
must O
be O
given O
to O
the O
Kasselers B-PER
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
says O
Horst B-PER
Michael I-PER
Brechtel I-PER
, O
professor O
and O
forest O
hydrologist O
at O
the O
Hessische B-ORG
Forstliche I-ORG
Versuchsanstalt I-ORG
in O
Hannover B-LOC
: O

“ O
We O
ca O
n’t O
let O
the O
cassettes B-MISC
dry O
out O
. O
” O

Brechtel B-PER
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
is O
less O
concerned O
with O
quantities O
than O
with O
qualities O
. O

Because O
the O
groundwater O
, O
he O
says O
, O
has O
already O
become O
worse O
. O

The O
blame O
for O
this O
is O
clearly O
attributed O
to O
the O
forest O
hydrologist O
to O
the O
pollutants O
. O

They O
come O
over O
the O
rain O
and O
the O
trees O
into O
the O
soil O
, O
which O
- O
if O
intact O
- O
is O
a O
fine O
filter O
. O

This O
ability O
to O
filter O
out O
pollutants O
, O
however O
, O
has O
already O
been O
lost O
by O
the O
soil O
, O
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
“ O
acid O
rain O
” O
. O

The O
forest O
floor O
is O
already O
completely O
" O
broken O
" O
in O
many O
places O
, O
Brechtel B-PER
knows O
. O

Aluminium O
, O
for O
example O
, O
can O
now O
enter O
groundwater O
and O
thus O
into O
the O
drinking O
water O
reservoir O
. O

The O
water O
plants O
will O
soon O
have O
problems O
with O
this O
, O
Brechtel B-PER
predicts O
. O

His O
advice O
: O

Instead O
of O
putting O
money O
into O
the O
then O
necessary O
water O
treatment O
, O
the O
water O
plants O
should O
participate O
" O
wise O
" O
in O
the O
cost O
of O
calcading O
- O
and O
hope O
that O
the O
forest O
as O
a O
water O
producer O
will O
survive O
thanks O
to O
these O
overflow O
measures O
until O
the O
pollutant O
loads O
have O
dropped O
dramatically O
. O

Three O
tons O
of O
limestone O
per O
hectare O
have O
already O
been O
scattered O
in O
parts O
of O
the O
Reinhards B-LOC
Forest I-LOC
to O
protect O
the O
soil O
( O
for O
about O
ten O
years O
) O
and O
save O
the O
trees O
for O
the O
next O
millennium O
. O

By O
that O
time O
, O
the O
harmful O
emissions O
would O
have O
to O
be O
drastically O
reduced O
, O
says O
Brechtel B-PER
. O

If O
in O
this O
regard O
" O
not O
finally O
" O
something O
happens O
, O
one O
can O
save O
the O
limestone O
of O
the O
forests O
: O

“ O
Let O
’s O
give O
the O
money O
to O
hungry O
children O
. O
” O

Those O
who O
are O
concerned O
about O
the O
trees O
in O
the O
Reinhardswald B-LOC
due O
to O
the O
planned O
additional O
water O
extraction O
, O
the O
expert O
has O
tried O
to O
reassure O
. O

In O
the O
Hessic B-MISC

, O
the O
oaks O
died O
as O
more O
water O
was O
drained O
and O
the O

from O
two O
meters O
deep O
to O
seven O

That O
, O
as O
Brechtel B-PER

will O
not O
happen O
in O

However O
, O
the O
closing O
concert O
with O
Mahler B-PER
was O
probably O
the O
most O
significant O
accent O
of O
the O
festival O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
former O
chief O
conductor O
of O
the O
Frankfurt B-ORG
Radio I-ORG

Mahler B-PER
's I-PER
second O
symphony O
, O
c O
- O
moll O
, O
a O
giant O
piece O
of O
late O
romantic O
symphony O
, O
whose O
performance O
takes O
almost O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
, O
is O
seen O
in O
its O
composition O
- O
orchestra O
, O
choir O
, O
and O
solo O
- O
rather O
as O
symphonic O
cantates O
. O

At O
its O
premiere O
in O
1895 O
, O
this O
symphony O
caused O
fierce O
controversy O
. O

Today O
, O
the O
play O
, O
probably O
due O
to O
its O
melodic O
" O
discovery O
" O
and O
its O
harmonical O
drama O
, O
counts O
among O
the O
more O
popular O
compositions O
of O
Mahler B-PER
- O
a O
symphonicist O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
whose O
final O
" O
discovery O
" O
fell O
in O
the O
early O
1960s O
of O
our O
century O
. O

It O
was O
called O
“ O
Mahler B-MISC
’s I-MISC
Euphoria I-MISC
. O
” O

Within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
interpretative O
sharpness O
with O
which O
Inbal B-PER
allowed O
the O
monumental O
work O
to O
develop O
clearly O
and O
logically O
, O
it O
was O
above O
all O
the O
singing O
solo O
of O
Alexandra B-PER
Coku I-PER
and O
Cornelia B-PER
Wulkopf I-PER
, O
which O
- O
in O
the O
final O
- O
guaranteed O
a O
truly O
iridescent O
, O
linear O
as O
well O
as O
in O
depth O
pressing O
contour O
. O

Especially O
Alexandra B-PER
Coku I-PER
, O
the O
soprano O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
captured O
the O
C O
- O
dur O
aura O
in O
the O
enormous O
epilogue O
of O
the O
symphony O
textually O
concisely O
, O
clearly O
and O
in O
exemplary O
intensity O
such O
as O
concentration O
. O

It O
all O
started O
very O
differently O
. O

Inbal B-PER
, O
who O
had O
the O
orchestra O
, O
the O
Prague B-ORG
Symphoniker I-ORG
, O
in O
charge O
, O
has O
interpreted O
the O
difficult O
psychology O
in O
the O
phrase O
of O
the O
head O
in O
a O
way O
that O
made O
it O
stop O
. O

Then O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
accents O
wandering O
through O
the O
ensemble O
were O
uncoordinated O
, O
the O
line O
shelled O
out O
only O
hesitantly O
: O

An O
irritating O
disposition O
for O
Mahler B-PER
's I-PER
epic O
spreading O
symphony O
. O

That O
came O
at O
first O
only O
dumb O
accentuated O
, O
fell O
in O
the O
otherwise O
surrounded O
by O
aura O
striping O
substance O
. O

Then O
the O
first O
blower O
signals O
, O
timely O
, O
accurate O
and O
full O
of O
radiation O
: O

That O
was O
dirigent O
suggestion O
, O
but O
also O
orchestral O
, O
instrumental O
pretence O
and O
virtuosity O
. O

Inbal B-PER
is O
continuously O
moving O
forward O
. O

The O
eclipse O
in O
the O
Tutti O
has O
a O
glass O
- O
clear O
profile O
, O
but O
next O
to O
it O
is O
also O
- O
not O
less O
intense O
- O
the O
morbid O
, O
" O
negative O
" O
gesture O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
becomes O
sugar O
: O

Of O
course O
, O
that O
belongs O
to O
Mahler B-PER
, O
who O
probably O
( O
except O
Richard B-PER
Strauss I-PER
) O
invented O
the O
most O
beautiful O
melodies O
of O
the O
ending O
tonal O
era O
. O

It O
is O
rebuilt O
, O
dispatched O
, O
rebuilt O
- O
plastically O
- O
thus O
has O
a O
clear O
basic O
idea O
. O

Admired O
was O
also O
the O
rhythmic O
" O
bite O
" O
which O
seems O
to O
make O
the O
inbal B-PER
the O
guiding O
motif O
of O
his O
interpretation O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
the O
performance O
also O
had O
a O
backbone O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
choir O
, O
the O
Frankfurter B-ORG
Singakademie I-ORG
( O

: O

Rarichs I-PER
) O
and O
the O
Caecilienchor B-ORG

( O

. O

That O
comes O
, O
so O
it O
wills O
Mahler B-PER
, O
so O
it O
does O
Inbal B-PER
, O
initially O
in O
great O
quiet O
, O
hymnically O
and O
sacramentally O
. O

In O
the O
initially O
simple O
genre O
, O
sounding O
metaphysics O
develops O
: O

“ O
Rise O

Heiko B-PER
Körber I-PER
, O
a O
professor O
at O
TH B-ORG
Darmstadt I-ORG
, O
warned O
of O
“ O
rapid O

” O

He O
questioned O
whether O
development O
aid O
would O
be O
“ O
the O
solution O
to O
the O
puzzle O
. O
” O

Through O
the O
media O
, O
a O
developed O
society O
only O
learns O
that O
countries O
exist O
where O
milk O
and O
honey O
flow O
. O

Given O
the O
economic O
and O
political O
pressures O
in O
their O
homeland O
, O
which O
are O
often O
intertwined O
, O
some O
people O
decide O
to O
migrate O
. O

Last O
but O
not O

, O
intellectuals O
, O
who O
are O
also O
more O
likely O
to O
engage O
in O
politics O
, O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
choose O
to O
flee O
than O
uneducated O
segments O
of O
the O
population O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
scientist O
explained O
the O
fact O
that O
a O
high O
number O
of O
representatives O
of O
“ O
high O
- O
educated O

” O
are O
among O
the O
asylum O

Landrat O
Karl B-PER
Eyerkaufer I-PER
( O

has O
complained O
about O
this O
. O

“ O
Education O
does O
not O
protect O
against O
persecution O
, O
” O
said O
the O
spokeswoman O
for O
a O
refugee O
initiative O
in O
Langendiebach B-LOC
. O

Racism O
is O
not O
politically O
solvable O
. O

Political O
scientists O
or O
sociologists O
should O
address O
this O
topic O
: O

“ O
This O
is O
a O
basic O
concern O
of O
the O
population O
, O
because O
many O
things O
are O
changing O
so O
rapidly O
; O
like O
the O
economy O
or O
pollution O
. O
” O

The O
existence O
of O
alien O
hostility O
is O
often O
a O
mirror O
of O
the O
social O
situation O
, O
” O
the O
woman O
confirmed O
. O

Also O
the O
speaker O
of O
the O
Institute B-ORG
of I-ORG
German I-ORG
Economy I-ORG
, O
Bernd B-PER
Hof I-PER
, O
called O
for O
a O
pedagogical O
approach O
. O

In O
his O
remarks O
he O
expressed O
the O
view O
that O
“ O
the O
migration O
potential O
is O
far O
greater O
than O
the O
integration O
potential O
” O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
from O
a O
“ O
work O
- O
market O
- O
oriented O
perspective O
” O
it O
shows O
that O
the O
German B-MISC
economy O
is O
dependent O
on O
foreign O
labor O
. O

The O
“ O
guest O
workers O
” O
owe O
the O
Federal O
Republic B-LOC
its O
“ O
social O
- O
political O
progress O
” O
. O

Without O
them O
, O
could O
have O
used O
less O
than O
four O
million O
workers O
in O
the O
last O
30 O
years O
. O

The O
potential O
of O
long O
- O
term O
unemployed O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Hof B-PER
’s I-PER
thesis O
, O
is O
not O
integrated O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
frequently O
falling O
argument O
, O
foreigners O
taking O
away O
German B-MISC
jobs O
, O
was O
overthrown O
. O

The O
environmental O
recovery O
of O
the O
last O
six O
years O
would O
not O
have O
been O
possible O
without O
immigrants O
. O

Migration O
flows O
from O
the O
EU B-MISC
countries I-MISC
are O
rapidly O
decreasing O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
restructuring O
from O
the O
focus O
of O
industry O
to O
the O
more O
employment O
- O
intensive O
service O
sector O
, O
the O
Federal B-LOC
Republic I-LOC
needs O
more O
workforce O
, O
the O
scientist O
believes O
. O

With O
an O
annual O
economic O
growth O
of O
2 O
percent O
, O
an O
average O
of O
300,000 O
new O
foreign O
forces O
will O
be O
needed O
per O
year O
by O
2010 O
. O

Because O
the O
age O
structure O
must O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
, O
Hof B-PER
called O
for O
“ O
transparency O
” O
towards O
taxpayers O
so O
that O
they O
know O
which O
people O
here O
have O
a O

The O

Therefore O
, O
Brandau B-PER
did O
not O

The O
consequence O
of O
the O
commitment O
of O
Jörg B-PER

( O
TSG B-ORG

, O
formerly O
TSG B-ORG

) O
as O

led O
to O
the O
resignation O
of O
Holger B-PER
Krause I-PER

The O
former O
DDR B-MISC
national I-MISC
player I-MISC
, O
who O
was O
last O
active O
at O
TV B-ORG

TV B-ORG
Gelnhausen I-ORG
, O
had O
initially O
nothing O
to O
object O
to O
Kleinschmidt B-PER
's O
obligation O
, O
but O
after O
a O
thought O
process O
changed O
his O
mind O
and O
resigned O
two O
days O
before O
the O
start O
of O
training O
. O

Shortly O
after O
, O
Krauses B-PER
’ O
predecessor O
, O
Peter B-PER
Wünsch I-PER
, O
was O
recovered O
. O

The O
last O
together O
active O
in O
Sulzbach B-LOC
Kleinschmidt B-PER
and O
Wünsch B-PER
are O
now O
to O
bear O
the O

together O
. O

Since O
after O
this O
action O
, O
Department O

Helmut B-PER
Becker I-PER
raised O
the O
question O
of O
confidence O
in O
the O

of O

and O
received O
no O
absolute O
back O
coverage O
regarding O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
uncontested O
Jörg B-PER
Kleinschmidt I-PER
in O
handball O
circles O
, O
he O
resigned O
with O
immediate O
effect O
from O
his O
position O
. O

Gerd B-PER
Hillen I-PER
will O
run O
for O
Becker B-PER
's O
successor O
at O
an O

on O
16 O
September O
, O
according O
to O
press O
spokesman O
Dietmar B-PER
Jäger I-PER
. O

Becker B-PER
, O
however O
, O
wants O
to O
continue O

, O
so O
the O

What O
happens O
to O
Krause B-PER
? O

The O
player O
coach O
who O
still O
resides O
in O
Aschaffenburg B-LOC

probably O
no O

although O
circuit O

Olaf B-PER
Sehl I-PER
is O
more O
optimistic O
in O
this O
sector O
: O

“ O
Maybe O
he O
’s O
back O
in O
the O

” O

Krause B-PER
faces O
various O
tests O
. O

Per O
the O
case O
of O
Kleinschmidt B-PER
did O
not O
even O
happen O
to O
him O
. O

Soon O
, O
he O
wants O
to O
move O
to O
establish O
himself O
professionally O
. O

After O
a O
small O
shock O
in O
player O
circles O
, O
the O
team O
appears O
to O
have O
caught O
up O

“ O

and O
“ O

” O

In O
the O
leaflet O
it O
was O
recently O
read O
that O
clever O
agricultural O

had O
organized O
pig O
races O
to O
entertain O
the O

, O
which O
naturally O
hunted O
the O

to O

For O
ours O
, O
however O
, O
it O
may O
be O
questioned O
whether O
the O
German B-MISC
domestic O
pigs O
, O
which O
are O
acclaimed O
as O
intelligently O
, O
are O
better O
off O
than O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
French B-MISC
Périgord B-MISC
pigs I-MISC
. O

Because O
the O
two O
relevant O
racing O
games O
bring O
maximum O
the O

, O
but O
no O
pride O
in O

and O
therefore O
also O
call O
no O

on O
the O
plan O
. O

The O
Swine B-MISC
Race I-MISC
proves O
once O
again O
how O
diverse O
play O
materials O
can O
be O
. O

As O
game O
characters O
, O
each O
of O
the O
two O
to O
four O
players O
receives O
two O
fat O
, O
spardos O
and O
a O
few O
gold O
coins O
, O
which O
he O
can O
distribute O
to O
the O
two O
ferrels O
according O
to O
Gusto O
. O

Distributed O
across O
the O
game O
plan O
are O
symbols O
. O

There O
you O
can O
read O
up O
gold O
coins O
on O
the O
way O
and O
put O
them O
in O
any O
pig O
- O
of O
course O
, O
your O
own O
. O

Or O
there O
are O
black O
lucky O
thalers O
. O

You O
can O
put O
it O
in O
any O
pig O
, O
of O
course O
, O
an O
opponent O
. O

And O
finally O
, O
the O
pig O
image O
allows O
you O
to O
take O
any O
spardose O
of O
the O
plan O
, O
hold O
it O
to O
your O
ear O
and O
shake O
it O

Thus O
, O
one O
can O
determine O
which O
competitive O
ferret O
with O
thick O
belly O
wants O
to O
run O
to O
the O
goal O
in O
order O
to O
feed O
it O
on O
the O
way O
still O
properly O
with O
unlucky O
plates O
. O

The O
movements O
are O
determined O
by O
a O
cubicle O
that O
has O
only O
eyes O
from O
1 O
to O
3 O
. O

The O
savings O
dozen O
do O
not O
replace O
each O
other O
from O
the O
plan O
. O

When O
a O
field O
is O
occupied O
, O
it O
is O
simply O
not O
counted O
and O
skipped O
. O

That O
’s O
why O
it O
’s O
said O
to O
always O
stay O
pretty O
on O
the O
row O
with O
the O
second O
swine O
. O

The O
one O
who O
has O
been O
hanged O
once O
, O
can O
no O
longer O
move O
forward O
quickly O
, O
because O
he O
can O
not O
constantly O
jump O
over O
others O
. O

There O
are O
prizes O
in O
the O
goal O
. O

Then O
it O
is O
calculated O
. O

For O
every O
black O
coin O
, O
one O
gold O
is O
lost O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
wins O
who O
could O
pull O
the O
fatest O
prey O
into O
the O
target O
. O

In O
the O
well O
- O
understood O
rule O
, O
a O
“ O
tip O
” O
is O
included O
. O

After O
that O
, O
it O
is O
permitted O
to O
exchange O
the O
coloured O
lock O
covers O
of O
the O
spare O
boxes O
with O
those O
of O
the O
fellow O
players O
so O
that O
each O
can O
distinguish O
his O
two O
boxes O
. O

But O
that O
loses O
the O
game O
. O

When O
both O
figures O
look O
the O
same O
, O
it O
’s O
much O
harder O
to O
remember O
which O
anti O
- O
swine O
feeds O
specifically O
and O
which O
is O
only O
dragged O
with O
. O

The O
title O
SCHWEINSGALOPP B-MISC
sounds O
similar O
, O
but O
the O
game O
is O
completely O
different O
. O

The O
highly O
fun O
graphics O
are O
child O
- O
friendly O
and O
lead O
just O
as O
wrong O
as O
the O
age O
indication O
of O
six O
to O
twelve O
years O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
children O
in O
this O
age O
group O
can O
play O
this O
game O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
also O
an O
unknown O
and O
in O
this O
disguise O
also O
almost O
undetectable O
runner O
for O
adults O
. O

The O
SCHWEINSGALOPP B-MISC
has O
since O
established O
itself O
as O
a O
constant O
fast O
" O
intermediate O
- O
in O
- O
game O
" O
and O
excites O
everyone O
who O
learns O
about O
it O
. O

The O
plan O
shows O
a O
round O
course O
without O
start O
and O
goal O
. O

On O
it O
, O
five O
colorful O
race O
pigs O
are O
placed O
in O
any O
order O
. O

They O
are O
preferably O
cast O
from O
massive O
plastic O
, O
and O
one O
has O
to O
be O
helplessly O
careful O
that O
they O
do O
not O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
children O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
they O
are O
guaranteed O
to O
be O
missing O
in O
the O
game O
box O
and O
wander O
in O
hood O
pockets O
or O
into O
the O
box O
with O
the O
building O
blocks O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
game O
plan O
, O
there O
are O
feed O
chips O
. O

Each O
player O
gets O
seven O
cards O
. O

At O
first O
, O
as O
with O
the O
different O
feed O
brands O
, O
one O
is O
looking O
for O
an O
interpretation O
for O
the O
graphics O
. O

But O
everything O
is O
much O
simpler O
: O

Chip O
is O
chip O
, O
and O
with O
the O
cards O
only O
the O
background O
color O
counts O
. O

Anyone O
on O
the O
train O
puts O
down O
a O
card O
and O
moves O
the O
pig O
of O
that O
color O
. O

No O
player O
has O
a O
particular O
character O
. O

Anyone O
can O
pull O
any O
sau O
. O

As O
with O
SWINERENNEN B-MISC
, O
fields O
occupied O
here O
are O
not O
counted O
. O

A O
pig O
just O
goes O
ahead O
of O
a O
field O
, O
and O
when O
others O
are O
in O
the O
way O
, O
they O
are O
skipped O
. O

If O
the O
straight O
- O
moving O
sau O
lands O
with O
its O
train O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
shell O
, O
then O
a O
feed O
chip O
will O
be O
placed O
in O
perspective O
as O
a O
salary O
. O

The O
player O
takes O
a O
plate O
and O
puts O
it O
in O
front O
of O
him O
. O

But O
she O
is O
not O
yet O
his O
. O

The O
round O
is O
quickly O
over O
, O
because O
everyone O
can O
only O
play O
seven O
cards O
. O

The O
trick O
is O
in O
the O
last O
train O
. O

Only O
when O
it O
succeeds O
to O
put O
a O
pig O
at O
the O
top O
, O
the O
food O
points O
collected O
so O
far O
are O
secured O
. O

Three O
rounds O
are O
played O
, O
which O
does O
not O
take O
ten O
minutes O
for O
routine O
players O
. O

The O
joke O
of O
the O
game O
is O
to O
crush O
the O
closed O
bunch O
of O
pigs O
by O
moving O
figures O
out O
of O
the O
middle O
. O

This O
forces O
the O
players O
to O
get O
the O
backbacks O
back O
to O
the O
top O
field O
, O
which O
costs O
cards O
without O
putting O
in O
chips O
. O

You O
can O
speculate O
so O
badly O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
realize O
, O
it O
is O
precisely O
the O
sau O
that O
fits O
to O
the O
last O
card O
that O
is O
hanged O
and O
isolated O
. O

And O
one O
of O
the O
players O
noticed O
this O
: O

Being O
a O
pig O
is O
beautiful O

Do O
you O
already O
have O
a O
hobby O
? O

Traces O
of O
animals O

In O
the O
past O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
recognize O
and O
interpret O
animal O
traces O
was O
vital O
for O
humans O
, O
after O
all O
, O
often O
dependent O
on O
the O
success O
of O
hunting O
or O
survival O
. O

Nowadays O
it O
is O
still O
important O
for O
hunters O
and O
forests O
to O
be O
able O
to O
read O
tracks O
in O
order O
to O
properly O
estimate O
the O
wildlife O
. O

In O
our O
time O
, O
it O
is O
important O
for O
the O
protection O
of O
wild O
animals O
that O
as O
many O
people O
as O
possible O
also O
have O
knowledge O
about O
their O
habits O
of O
life O
- O
because O
who O
can O
interpret O
animal O
traces O
learns O
many O
behaviors O
of O
the O
animals O
. O

He O
may O
therefore O
also O
be O
more O
attentive O
to O
the O
needs O
of O
wild O
animals O
than O
to O
someone O
who O
runs O
" O
blindly O
" O
through O
the O
forest O
and O
the O
corridor O
. O

Searching O
for O
tracks O
can O
become O
an O
interesting O
hobby O
where O
you O
can O
also O
do O
something O
for O
your O
health O
. O

While O
one O
often O
discovered O
no O
other O
animal O
during O
a O
walk O
through O
the O
woods O
and O
fields O
except O
for O
some O
birds O
and O
insects O
, O
because O
most O
mammals O
dimmed O
. O

Being O
nocturnal O
and O
shy O
, O
however O
, O
reveals O
to O
the O
expert O
signs O
and O
traces O
that O
animals O
have O
left O
, O
a O
lot O
about O
their O
presence O
and O
behavior O
. O

For O
example O
the O
eagles O
: O

Young O
squirrels O
must O
first O
learn O
to O
crack O
a O
nut O
properly O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
rodent O
traces O
of O
hazelnuts O
reveal O
whether O
a O
young O
, O
inexperienced O
or O
an O
old O
, O
routine O
animal O
has O
tried O
here O
as O
a O
nut O
cracker O
. O

Food O
traces O
of O
birds O
on O
fruit O
are O
clearly O
visible O
on O
the O
pick O
traces O
. O

Frogs O
hole O
out O
apples O
by O
picking O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
shell O
and O
then O
picking O
out O
the O
fruit O
meat O
, O
while O
frogs O
are O
less O
interested O
in O
the O
fruit O
meat O
, O
but O
only O
in O
the O
nuclei O
. O

A O
walk O
in O
the O
forest O
can O
be O
quite O
exciting O
with O
such O
knowledge O

At O

everyone O

The O

He O
is O
the O
answer O
, O
the O
solution O
, O
” O
John B-PER
recommends O
the O
passing O
man O

Finally O
, O
he O
wants O
to O
show O
people O
that O
this O
is O
the O
way O

” O

Even O
“ O
the O
most O
precious O
way O
, O
” O
the O
young O
man O
energetically O
adds O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
Church O
must O
also O
come O
out O
of O
the O
church O
walls O
, O
" O
run O
to O
the O
people O

and O
promote O
the O

: O

With O
the O
Bible B-MISC
Market I-MISC
surrounding O
the O
Catholic O
Church O
, O
which O
had O
been O
prepared O
by O
the O
Evangelical O
Land O
Church O
, O
the O
Evangelical O
Free O

and O
the O
Catholic O

. O

For O
“ O
it O
is O
obvious O
, O
” O
says O
organizer O
Wolfgang B-PER
Buttkewitz I-PER
, O
“ O
that O
the O
Bible B-MISC
is O
being O
read O
less O
and O
less O
. O
” O

So O
Christians B-MISC
in O
the O
Year O
of O
the O
Bible B-MISC
had O
to O
come O
up O
with O
something O
together O
beyond O
the O

in O
the O

: O

“ O
The O
man O
, O
” O
organizer O
Buttkewitz B-PER
knows O
, O
“ O
is O
curious O
from O
home O
. O
” O

Therefore O
, O
the O
rumbling O
about O
the O
Holy B-MISC
Scriptures I-MISC
is O
to O
attract O
the O
curious O
. O

To O
that O
extent O
, O
says O
the O
former O
pastor O
from O
the O
Mennonite B-LOC
community I-LOC
, O
“ O
Christians B-MISC
do O
this O
like O

” O
: O

Per O
believers O
do O
n’t O
always O
read O
the O
Bible B-MISC
, O
but O
more O
and O
more O
. O

And O
much O
would O
have O
been O
achieved O
. O

Especially O
in O
a O
society O
, O
Buttkewitz B-PER
emphasizes O
, O
in O
which O
“ O

time O
takes O

adds O
the O
Commissioner O

for O
a O
new O

For O
decades O
, O
the O
Bible B-MISC

been O
regarded O
as O
a O

for O
the O

By O
seeking O
“ O

the O
Bible B-MISC
“ O

Therefore O

Grimm B-PER
hopes O

The O

Rules O
of O
Income O
for O
Medicines O

Many O
rheumatoid O
medicines O
, O
but O
also O
medicines O
for O
constipation O
, O
enzyme O
preparations O
and O
some O
pills O
for O
depression O
are O
offered O
to O
patients O
in O
a O
special O
form O
: O

They O
are O
surrounded O
by O
a O
“ O
stomach O
- O
resistant O
” O
protective O
shell O
. O

This O
means O
that O
such O
drugs O
only O
dissolve O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
and O
from O
there O
fully O
develop O
their O
active O
substances O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
is O
also O
the O
consideration O
that O
the O
aggressive O
stomach O
juice O
should O
not O
affect O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
preparation O
and O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
stomach O
mucosa O
should O
not O
come O
into O
contact O
with O
the O
ingredients O
of O
the O
drug O
. O

Generally O
, O
for O
“ O
stomach O
- O
resistant O
” O
or O
“ O
thin O
intestine O
- O
soluble O
” O
medicines O
, O
the O
rule O
of O
intake O
is O
to O
swallow O
the O
dose O
prescribed O
by O
the O
doctor O
along O
with O
food O
. O

However O
, O
recent O
studies O
by O
gastroenterologists O
( O
gastrointestinal O
specialists O
) O
show O
that O
this O
is O
apparently O
completely O
wrong O
. O

The O
controls O
found O
that O
medicines O
remained O
in O
the O
stomach O
much O
longer O
when O
taken O
with O
food O
. O

The O
dragees O
or O
capsules O
surrounded O
by O
a O
protective O
shell O
( O
sometimes O
also O
known O
as O
so O
- O
called O
retard O
preparations O
with O
a O
long O
- O
term O
effect O
) O
remain O
as O
indigestible O
in O
the O
stomach O
and O
therefore O
do O
not O
enter O
the O
intestines O
with O
the O
food O
bread O
pre O
- O
digested O
by O
the O
stomach O
juice O
. O

It O
is O
unfavourable O
to O
postpone O
a O
small O
intermittent O
meal O
for O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
( O
less O
than O
two O
hours O
) O
after O
a O
main O
meal O
while O
taking O
the O
drug O
. O

The O
digestion O
of O
these O
foods O
then O
again O
takes O
precedence O
and O
the O
medicines O
unopened O
by O
the O
stomach O
juice O
may O
remain O
in O
the O
stomach O
for O
up O
to O
twelve O
hours O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
, O
the O
medicines O
taken O
conscientiously O
can O
stagnate O
in O
the O
stomach O
and O
clump O
together O
, O
because O
with O
the O
following O
main O
meals O
, O
the O
next O
dose O
is O
usually O
swallowed O
. O

You O
can O
strangle O
the O
stomach O
with O
its O
digestive O
movements O
only O
by O
taking O
nothing O
edible O
at O
all O
for O
more O
than O
two O
hours O
. O

Then O
the O
stomach O
transports O
the O
remaining O
medicines O
to O
where O
they O
belong O
– O
to O
the O
small O
intestine O
. O

But O
how O
can O
such O
revenue O
breaks O
be O
prevented O
, O
which O
disrupt O
treatment O
and O
sometimes O
even O
prevent O
its O
success O
? O

According O
to O
the O
latest O
recommendations O
of O
physicians O
, O
one O
takes O
so O
- O
called O
stomach O
acid O
- O
resistant O
, O
small O
intestine O
- O
soluble O
drugs O
better O
in O
the O
morning O
sober O
and O
during O
the O
day O
between O
meals O
. O

However O
, O
you O
should O
not O
snack O
between O
the O
main O
meals O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
the O
stomach O
does O
not O
hold O
the O
medicines O
that O
are O
not O
digestible O
for O
it O
anymore O
. O

Preparations O
taken O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
enter O
the O
small O
intestine O
within O
70 O
minutes O
at O
the O
latest O
. O

It O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
observe O
the O
natural O
rhythm O
of O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
stomach O
: O

At O
night O
, O
this O
organ O
rests O
, O
and O
medicines O
with O
a O
depository O
effect O
remain O
as O
well O
as O
other O
indigestible O
or O
hard O
- O
to O
- O
digest O
foods O
until O
the O
stomach O
restores O
its O
digestive O
work O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

It O
is O
also O
advisable O
to O
always O
take O
medication O
standing O
and O
with O
plenty O
of O
fluid O
. O

They O
then O
slide O
better O
and O
do O
n’t O
get O
stuck O
in O
the O
esophagus O
halfway O
. O

Since O
these O
intake O
recommendations O
correspond O
to O
the O
latest O
medical O
findings O
, O
they O
are O
generally O
not O
yet O
very O
well O
known O

While O

, O
the O
FSV B-ORG
played O
in O
the O
traditional O
colors O
red O
and O
white O
of O
the O
guests O
. O

And O
as O
a O
guest O
team O
, O
the O
FSV B-ORG
also O
played O
at O
first O
. O

The O
Bockenheims B-MISC
determined O
the O
game O
in O
the O
first O
half O
hour O
, O
combined O
better O
and O
had O
the O
first O
big O
chance O
after O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
also O
by O
a O
flat O
shot O
by O
Björn B-PER
Pistauer I-PER
, O
who O
passed O
a O
meter O
at O
the O
FSV B-MISC
goal I-MISC
. O

It O
was O
striking O
how O
much O
space O
the O
FSV B-ORG
, O
which O
seemed O
strangely O
insecure O
, O
left O
the O
guests O
. O

Then O
the O
FSV B-ORG
also O
had O
to O
change O
, O
as O
Ralf B-PER
Zgraja I-PER
injured O
himself O
after O
28 O
minutes O
already O
so O
seriously O
that O
he O
had O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

For O
him O
, O
Michael B-PER
Sandt I-PER
, O
whom O
FSVTrainer B-MISC
Dörenberg B-PER
referred O
to O
as O
his O
model O
student O
, O
took O
over O
the O
man O
's O
cover O
against O
Michael B-PER
Rexroth I-PER
. O

Nine O
minutes O
later O
came O
the O
next O
blow O
for O
the O
FSV B-ORG
: O

After O
a O
harmless O
duel O
with O
Thomas B-PER
Hoßmang I-PER
, O
Marco B-PER
Grevelhörster I-PER
was O
sentenced O
by O
the O
small O
referee O
. O

However O
, O
with O
ten O
men O
, O
the O
FSV B-ORG
finally O
showed O
the O
bite O
that O
they O
had O
missed O
until O
then O
, O
and O
reached O
the O
first O
chance O
by O
Collins B-PER
Etebu I-PER
shortly O
before O
the O
shift O
, O
but O
this O
shooting O
attempt O
also O
remained O
hanging O
in O
the O
red O
- O
white B-MISC
defense I-MISC
. O

Thanks O
to O
referee O
Steudter B-PER
, O
who O
already O
distributed O
four O
yellow O
cards O
and O
a O
time O
penalty O
in O
the O
first O
45 O
minutes O
, O
there O
was O
at O
least O
a O
little O
talk O
in O
the O
break O
. O

The O
game O
itself O
has O
so O
far O
provided O
little O
opportunity O
for O
discussion O
. O

After O
the O
shift O
, O
the O
FSV B-ORG
became O
stronger O
, O
especially O
the O
large O
Grevelhörster B-PER
was O
a O
permanent O
riot O
in O
the O
red O
- O
white B-MISC
coverage I-MISC
. O

But O
the O
biggest O
chance O
of O
the O
game O
were O
the O
“ O
red B-ORG
” O
: O

Oliver B-PER
Roth I-PER
came O
free O
to O
the O
headball O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
second O
half O
after O
a O
precise O
flank O
of O
Rexroth B-PER
, O
but O
headed O
- O
fortunately O
for O
his O
former O
club O
- O
over O
the O
latte O
. O

Shortly O
thereafter O
, O
Roth B-PER
again O
failed O
at O
the O
FSVLotter B-MISC
Marcus B-PER
Croonen I-PER
, O
and O
FSVTrainer B-MISC
Dörenberg B-PER
became O
more O
and O
more O
excited O
on O
the O
outer O
line O
. O

At O
Red B-ORG

White I-ORG
, O
the O
outstanding O
Libero O
Hoßmang B-PER
brought O
rest O
in O
his O
defense O
in O
the O
short O
FSV B-MISC
vortex I-MISC
after O
the O
break O
, O
while O
Pistauer O
almost O
completely O
excluded O
the O
central O
figure O
of O
the O
FSV B-ORG
in O
the O
midfield O
, O
Ivan B-PER
Duzel I-PER
. O

In O
the O

, O
the O

finally O
had O
the O

by O
the O

, O
the O

The O

" O

only O

" O

The O

explicitly O
points O
out O
in O

that O
" O
we O
support O
all O

to O

However O

the O
