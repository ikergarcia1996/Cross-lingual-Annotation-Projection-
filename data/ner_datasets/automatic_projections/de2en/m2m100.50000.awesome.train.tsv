Albrecht B-PER
Lehmann I-PER
speaks O
to O
refugees O
and O
displaced O
persons O
in O
West B-LOC
Germany I-LOC
, O
1945 O
- O
1990 O
. O

Discussions O
on O
asylum O
seekers O
, O
displaced O
persons O
and O
immigration O
issues O
have O
dominated O
politics O
and O
the O
media O
in O
Germany B-LOC
in O
recent O
months O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
not O
difficult O
at O
the O
moment O
to O
attract O
attention O
with O
the O
publication O
of O
a O
book O
on O
refugees O
and O
displaced O
persons O
in O
West B-LOC
Germany I-LOC
from O
1945 O
to O
1990 O
. O

And O
indeed O
, O
there O
are O
hardly O
any O
serious O
scientific O
discussions O
that O
have O
taken O
on O
this O
topic O
so O
far O
. O

It O
is O
questionable O
, O
however O
, O
whether O
such O
an O
actuality O
must O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
an O
undoubtedly O
upcoming O
debate O
to O
deprive O
it O
of O
its O
actual O
core O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
distortion O
of O
the O
difference O
between O
past O
and O
present O
problem O
constellations O
. O

In O
his O
book B-MISC
I I-MISC
m O
Fremden O

, O
Albrecht O
Lehmann O
attempts O
to O
take O
a O
neutral O
perspective O
, O
free O
from O
blame O
and O
innocence O
, O
on O
a O
policy O
and O
its O
consequences O
that O
led O
to O
the O
12 O
million O
people O
fleeing O
or O
displaced O
from O
East B-LOC
Germany I-LOC
and O
the O
German B-MISC
settlements O
in O
Eastern B-LOC
Europe I-LOC
at O
the O
end O
of O
World O
War O
II O
. O

In O
what O
way O
the O
" O
refugees O
" O
- O
as O
it O
was O
called O
immediately O
after O
the O
war O
with O
a O
pejorative O
taste O
- O
or O
" O
districted O
" O
- O
has O
been O
the O
common O
term O
since O
about O
. O

In O
1948 O
- O
found O
in O
their O
new O
conditions O
and O
how O
these O
experiences O
have O
traded O
over O
the O
next O
decades O
in O
the O
different O
generations O
to O
the O
present O
day O
, O
Lehmann B-PER
demonstrates O
by O
means O
of O
a O
series O
of O
stories O
, O
personal O
records O
, O
diaries O
and O
documents O
of O
the O
displaced O
press O
. O

Nowadays O
a O
picture O
is O
promoted O
which O
, O
although O
not O
surprisingly O
, O
yet O
in O
its O
composition O
convincingly O
allows O
readers O
to O
follow O
up O
on O
a O
specific O
type O
of O
foreign O
experience O
. O

The O
respective O
experiences O
and O
their O
handling O
are O
presented O
very O
differently O
. O

However O
, O
certain O
issues O
are O
repeatedly O
raised O
: O

Thus O
, O
the O
rape O
of O
German B-MISC
women O
by O
members O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
not O
only O
led O
to O
irreparable O
mental O
disorders O
in O
the O
women O
themselves O
, O
but O
also O
to O
complicated O
marital O
relationships O
that O
often O
ruled O
the O
lives O
of O
entire O
families O
for O
years O
after O
these O
events O
. O

The O
detachment O
from O
the O
old O
homeland O
produced O
in O
many O
cases O
forms O
of O
social O
over O
- O
adaptation O
, O
which O
especially O
in O
narrow O
village O
communities O
caused O
difficulties O
with O
the O
elderly O
population O
. O

A O
" O
sentimental O
insistence O
" O
on O
ancient O
traditions O
and O
customs O
expressed O
how O
incapable O
the O
displaced O
were O
to O
forget O
the O
old O
homeland O
. O

In O
all O
the O
narratives O
it O
becomes O
evident O
that O
the O
pursuit O
of O
social O
harmony O
has O
long O
been O
the O
guiding O
factor O
of O
action O
. O

Creating O
a O
new O
sense O
of O
community O
should O
compensate O
for O
the O
loss O
mostly O
experienced O
as O
cruel O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
showing O
such O
typical O
difficulties O
, O
one O
of O
the O
strengths O
of O
the O
book O
is O
to O
highlight O
the O
differences O
in O
the O
experiences O
of O
different O
generations O
. O

So O
it O
becomes O
plausible O
that O
the O
generation O
that O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
sixties O
and O
seventies O
wanted O
little O
to O
do O
with O
the O
past O
of O
their O
parents O
who O
had O
been O
displaced O
. O

A O
consciousness O
of O
the O
“ O
lost O
homeland O
” O
existed O
; O
however O
, O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
sentimentally O
occupied O
. O

This O
changed O
only O
again O
in O
the O
eighties O
, O
when O
in O
Germany B-LOC
a O
Renaissance O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
homeland O
allowed O
a O
stronger O
reference O
to O
the O
former O
German B-MISC
settlement O
areas O
. O

In O
describing O
and O
reproducing O
the O
stories O
of O
the O
displaced O
, O
Lehmann B-PER
will O
not O
tire O
of O
repeatedly O
pointing O
out O
that O
, O
despite O
long O
- O
held O
prejudices O
, O
they O
do O
not O
adhere O
to O
revenge O
. O

One O
can O
believe O
the O
author O
who O
understands O
his O
book O
as O
a O
contribution O
to O
understanding O
different O
nations O
, O
when O
he O
in O
this O
sense O
calls O
to O
conceive O
of O
the O
old O
homeland O
only O
as O
a O
“ O
homeland O
in O
the O
head O
” O
. O

However O
, O
despite O
this O
praiseful O
attitude O
and O
programmatic O
, O
the O
many O
reports O
and O
narratives O
leave O
a O
delicate O
aftertaste O
, O
which O
is O
primarily O
due O
to O
the O
methodology O
of O
German B-MISC
folk O
science O
. O

History O
, O
as O
it O
is O
written O
in O
this O
book O
, O
is O
reproduced O
primarily O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
those O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

The O
one O
story O
breaks O
down O
into O
many O
stories O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
can O
be O
scientifically O
accurately O
classified O
by O
different O
genres O
. O

Thus O
, O
success O
stories O
, O
slums O
, O
and O
overthrow O
stories O
are O
typical O
forms O
of O
telling O
a O
particular O
group O
that O
today O
still O
wants O
to O
forget O
their O
initial O
difficulties O
in O
the O
new O
home O
. O

A O
suppressive O
form O
of O
storytelling O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
to O
find O
out O
among O
women O
who O
have O
become O
victims O
of O
rape O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
this O
scientifically O
derived O
classification O
of O
narrative O
types O
remains O
only O
external O
. O

The O
narratives O
themselves O
are O
central O
in O
the O
present O
form O
of O
presentation O
; O
a O
reflection O
on O
them O
and O
therefore O
a O
possibility O
for O
evaluation O
and O
classification O
remains O
out O
. O

However O
, O
this O
circumstance O
leads O
too O
easily O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
compassionate O
understanding O
or O
sympathetic O
identification O
with O
those O
affected O
will O
make O
those O
constellations O
of O
history O
forgotten O
, O
in O
the O
framework O
of O
which O
the O
undoubtedly O
cruel O
individual O
events O
must O
be O
presented O
. O

For O
example O
, O
it O
appears O
quite O
irritating O
when O
the O
" O
double O
fortune O
" O
of O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
from O
Siebenbürgen B-LOC
is O
, O
who O
as O
a O
Volksdeutscher B-MISC
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
join O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
, O
but O
had O
to O
join O
the O
Waffen B-ORG
- I-ORG
SS I-ORG
; O
who O
was O
therefore O
able O
to O
save O
himself O
over O
the O
war O
years O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
was O
spared O
from O
the O
captivity O
. O

Considering O
the O
fortune O
of O
an O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
is O
one O
side O
. O

The O
other O
must O
be O
to O
classify O
the O
individual O
fates O
in O
such O
a O
way O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
and O
the O
years O
thereafter O
that O
an O
objective O
perspective O
can O
be O
taken O
. O

It O
is O
a O
mistake O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
mere O
reproduction O
of O
authentic O
accounts O
must O
inevitably O
lead O
to O
an O
adequate O
view O
of O
history O
. O

Rather O
, O
it O
carries O
the O
danger O
of O
a O
look O
at O
history O
that O
stylizes O
all O
involved O
to O
their O
victims O
. O

It O
is O
undoubtedly O
necessary O
to O
deal O
also O
with O
the O
victims O
of O
history O
who O
stood O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
perpetrators O
. O

It O
should O
be O
avoided O
, O
however O
, O
to O
make O
a O
push O
for O
a O
relativization O
of O
history O
, O
which O
seeks O
to O
blur O
all O
differences O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
" O
recomprehensible O
understanding O
" O
. O

In O
this O
context O
, O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
issue O
programmatic O
slogans O
for O
the O
" O
reconciliation O
of O
all O
cultures O
" O
. O

Rather O
, O
this O
leads O
to O
other O
fundamental O
misunderstandings O
that O
contribute O
to O
blurring O
crucial O
differences O
. O

This O
distortion O
is O
most O
clearly O
seen O
in O
Lehmann B-PER
at O
the O
point O
where O
he O
advocates O
a O
“ O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
” O
and O
declares O
this O
as O
a O
perspective O
that O
should O
arise O
from O
a O
non O
- O
revanchist O
expatriate O
perspective O
, O
so O
that O
the O
German B-MISC
solution O
to O
the O
expatriate O
problem O
becomes O
a O
model O
for O
those O
questions O
and O
problems O
that O
arise O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
immigration O
movements O
: O

The O
topic O
of O
this O
book O
remains O
current O
: O

The O
question O
of O
how O
individuals O
and O
families O
with O
their O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
find O
a O
new O
homeland O
in O
our O
country O
, O
in O
what O
memories O
they O
carry O
and O
tradite O
the O
old O
homeland O
and O
the O
culture O
of O
the O
region O
of O
origin O
, O
in O
what O
way O
they O
nurture O
the O
contact O
with O
the O
first O
homeland O
. O

In O
the O
equalization O
of O
the O
problems O
of O
displaced O
persons O
and O
asylum O
- O
seekers O
and O
their O
respective O
experiences O
in O
foreign O
affairs O
, O
the O
fundamental O
difference O
between O
these O
groups O
is O
turned O
under O
the O
table O
. O

A O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
consists O
in O
the O
coexistence O
of O
the O
most O
diverse O
ethnic O
groups O
, O
which O
it O
has O
forcibly O
or O
intentionally O
pushed O
to O
Germany B-LOC
or O
other O
countries O
of O
Europe B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
the O
alienation O
experiences O
of O
these O
groups O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
fundamentally O
different O
from O
those O
of O
the O
expats O
in O
the O
1940s O
or O
their O
children O
decades O
later O
. O

The O
latter O
have O
proven O
to O
identify O
with O
Germany B-LOC
despite O
the O
losses O
of O
the O
" O
old O
homeland O
in O
the O
east O
" O
, O
have O
built O
up O
a O
national O
consciousness O
due O
to O
their O
ethnicity O
. O

Such O
identification O
is O
neither O
possible O
nor O
desirable O
for O
immigrants O
. O

While O
for O
the O
expats O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
homogeneous O
national O
state O
was O
determining O
, O
for O
asylum O
seekers O
and O
immigrants O
today O
it O
is O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
heterogeneous O
national O
state O
. O

A O
focus O
on O
subjective O
sensitivities O
, O
as O
done O
in O
this O
volume O
, O
should O
not O
lead O
to O
neglecting O
fundamental O
, O
objective O
differences O
. O

This O
is O
neither O
useful O
to O
a O
scientific O
context O
, O
nor O
does O
it O
help O
the O
author O
’s O
desire O
to O
“ O
build O
” O
a O
Europe B-LOC
in O
which O
differences O
are O
overcome O
without O
denying O
them O

The O
marriage O
seemed O
happy O

Andrea B-PER
was O
happy O

When O
she O
was O
24 O
years O
old O
, O
she O
was O
pregnant O
for O
the O
second O
time O

She O
always O
wanted O
to O

many O

However O
, O
after O
Mirjam B-PER

birth O
, O
she O
felt O
overwhelmed O
. O

Andrea B-PER
began O
to O
eat O
more O
and O
more O
. O

It O
was O
no O
longer O
the O
healthy O
appetite O
that O
drew O
her O
to O
the O

She O
suddenly O
put O
a O

of O
food O
in O
her O

And O
at O
some O
point O

the O

Andrea B-PER
had O
become O

was O
a O

her O

That O
she O
was O
sick O

she O
did O
not O
know O
at O
the O
time O

Only O
when O
she O
read O
a O
diet O
book O
one O
day O
, O
she O
noticed O
it O
. O

It O
was O
described O
as O
an O
addicted O
woman O
- O
and O
in O
that O
story O
Andrea B-PER
recognized O
herself O
again O
. O

At O
that O
moment O
she O
realized O
that O
she O
had O
to O
do O
something O
against O
her O
suffering O
. O

Andrea B-PER
took O
the O
initiative O
and O
registered O
at O
a O
clinic O
for O
addicts O
in O
Allgäu B-LOC
. O

A O
few O
weeks O
later O
, O
she O
left O
her O
husband O
and O
children O
for O
a O
three O
- O
month O
therapy O
. O

Her O
relatives O
accused O
her O
of O
being O
a O
rabbit O
mother O
. O

It O
was O
clear O
to O
Andrea B-PER
: O

“ O
I O
can O
only O
be O
a O
good O
mother O
if O
I O
am O
well O
. O
” O

When O
Andrea B-PER
introduced O
herself O
on O
the O
first O
day O
in O
the O
group O
, O
she O
said O
: O

" O
My O
name O
is O
Andrea B-PER
, O
I O
eat O
too O
much O
, O
but O
I O
have O
no O
other O
problems O
. O
" O

Everyone O
laughed O
, O
and O
soon O
she O
knew O
why O
. O
” O

I O
had O
supplanted O
my O
problems O
until O
therapy O
. O
” O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
Andrea B-PER
was O
not O
so O
satisfied O
with O
her O
existence O
as O
a O
young O
mother O
and O
wife O
. O

Today O
she O
admits O
: O

“ O
I O
still O
feel O
like O
I O
missed O
something O
in O
my O
youth O
. O
” O

Through O
therapy O
, O
however O
, O
she O
has O
learned O
to O
deal O
with O
her O
dissatisfaction O
, O
her O
fears O
and O
worries O
. O

When O
the O
27 O

Sociology O
is O
not O
without O

For O
it O

nothing O

the O

What O
a O
wonder O
that O
the O
society O
so O
targeted O
reacted O
suspiciously O
to O
the O
acquisition O
by O
sociology O
. O

Until O
the O
time O
of O
Adenauer O
, O
the O
lady O
society O
, O
which O
had O
grown O
to O
public O
reputation O
, O
felt O
most O
embarrassingly O
touched O
by O
the O
approaches O
of O
the O
becoming O
duller O
sociology O
. O

It O
was O
only O
in O
the O
turbulent O
political O
periods O
of O
the O
late O
1960s O
that O
she O
gave O
in O
to O
her O
stormy O
urges O
. O

The O
society B-ORG
of I-ORG
sociology I-ORG
fell O
into O
its O
arms O
. O

This O
yes O
- O
word O
has O
led O
to O
a O
covenant O
for O
life O
, O
but O
it O
has O
become O
anything O
but O
a O
burning O
love O
relationship O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
enthusiasm O
has O
been O
driven O
by O
the O
expectations O
of O
this O
young O
social O
science O
at O
the O
height O
of O
its O
academic O
expansion O
. O

The O
conviction O
that O
was O
associated O
with O
that O
demanding O
goal O
of O
knowledge O
was O
to O
formulate O
a O
theory O
of O
the O
whole O
of O
society O
that O
should O
be O
both O
critical O
and O
practically O
changing O
. O

Are O
we O
therefore O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
process O
in O
which O
the O
utopian O
energies O
, O
invested O
in O
the O
enormous O
undertaking O
of O
an O
enlightenmental O
and O
critical O
revolution O
of O
all O
outdated O
working O
and O
living O
relationships O
, O
have O
completely O
emerged O
? O

Asked O
otherwise O
: O

How O
can O
the O
attractiveness O
of O
sociology O
as O
a O
force O
of O
change O
of O
reality O
be O
recovered O
, O
which O
it O
reduced O
to O
normal O
science O
in O
the O
course O
of O
its O
“ O
maturation O
process O
” O
? O

There O
are O
three O
main O
reasons O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
utopia O
in O
sociology O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
the O
utopia O
itself O
that O
has O
become O
modest O
out O
of O
the O
historically O
until O
recently O
intrusive O
experience O
of O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
great O
visionary O
promises O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
utopian O
challenge O
, O
which O
has O
become O
more O
and O
more O
concrete O
, O
has O
been O
posed O
by O
the O
simple O
cunning O
of O
realising O
utopian O
ideals O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
historical O
situation O
has O
taken O
on O
a O
gravity O
that O
permits O
any O
project O
of O
longing O
for O
something O
entirely O
different O
in O
the O
forthcoming O
morning O
to O
be O
merely O
an O
apocalypse O
. O

The O
wishes O
of O
the O
origin O
of O
modernity O
have O
been O
transformed O
in O
the O
critical O
tradition O
of O
the O
social O
doctrine O
into O
a O
concrete O
utopia O
of O
the O
real O
course O
of O
history O
of O
progressive O
bourgeois O
emancipation O
. O

The O
stage O
goes O
from O
the O
fictional O
future O
paintings O
of O
a O
Morus B-PER
, O
Campanella B-PER
, O
and O
Bacon B-PER
to O
the O
technical O
and O
early O
socialist O
utopism O
of O
Owen B-PER
, O
Saint B-PER
- I-PER
Simon I-PER
, O
Fourier B-PER
, O
and O
Proudhon B-PER
. O

Against O
these O
utopian O
socialists O
, O
Marx B-PER
polemized O
with O
all O
its O
sharpness O
, O
accusing O
them O
of O
being O
merely O
dreamers O
. O

He O
himself O
, O
like O
so O
many O
things O
, O
puts O
the O
utopia O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
and O
comes O
to O
the O
point O
materialistically O
: O

In O
communism O
, O
utopia O
and O
reality O
fuse O
as O
the O
society O
of O
free O
producers O
, O
as O
material O
abundance O
, O
and O
as O
transparent O
social O
relationships O
for O
all O
members O
of O
society O
. O

However O
, O
this O
concretization O
of O
Utopia O
has O
by O
no O
means O
led O
to O
the O
promised O
paradise O
. O

For O
, O
as O
we O
read O
in O
Horkheimer B-LOC
’s I-LOC
diary O
note O
from O
the O
1950s O
, O
the O
sky O
to O
which O
one O
can O
point O
the O
way O
is O
none O
. O

and O
more O
: O

Productive O
forces O
emerged O
as O
destructive O
forces O
, O
class O
consciousness O
became O
a O
fossil O
by O
the O
individualization O
of O
living O
conditions O
, O
and O
revolutions O
did O
not O
prove O
to O
be O
the O
locomotive O
of O
world O
history O
. O

Rather O
, O
in O
the O
words O
of O
Walter B-PER
Benjamin I-PER
, O
they O
are O
the O
grip O
of O
the O
human O
race O
travelling O
in O
this O
train O
after O
the O
emergency O
brake O
. O

The O
shock O
of O
those O
" O
normal O
disasters O
" O
, O
such O
as O
the O
reactor O
accidents O
that O
threaten O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
species O
, O
has O
ripped O
the O
social O
science O
out O
of O
the O
dorm O
of O
progressive O
belief O
. O

This O
awakening O
finds O
its O
present O
expression O
in O
the O
abbreviated O
concept O
of O
the O
“ O
risk O
society O
” O
, O
whose O
secret O
message O
of O
salvation O
is O
to O
make O
the O
course O
of O
the O
world O
still O
controllable O
according O
to O
an O
enlightened O
enlightenment O
of O
itself O
. O

This O
hope O
of O
Ulrich B-PER
Beck I-PER
’s O
“ O
reflective O
modernization O
” O
is O
by O
no O
means O
new O
. O

In O
order O
to O
avoid O
the O
predictable O
catastrophe O
, O
already O
leading O
sociologists O
of O
the O
Weimar B-MISC
era I-MISC
, O
such O
as O
Max B-PER
Weber I-PER
and O
Karl B-PER
Mannheim I-PER
, O
argued O
that O
the O
real O
is O
to O
approach O
the O
concrete O
utopian O
. O

And O
in O
fact O
: O

The O
rule O
of O
law O
, O
democratic O
self O
- O
determination O
and O
material O
welfare O
are O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
disenchanted O
form O
of O
realization O
of O
that O
utopia O
that O
has O
long O
since O
been O
taken O
from O
heaven O
to O
earth O
: O

Everyone O
produces O
according O
to O
his O
abilities O
, O
each O
consumes O
according O
to O
his O
needs O
. O

This O
secularized O
ideal O
of O
the O
right O
of O
all O
to O
everything O
, O
however O
, O
is O
now O
seen O
as O
utopianly O
outdated O
by O
the O
ecologically O
- O
inspired O
“ O
utopia O
of O
zero O
option O
” O
, O
more O
specifically O
: O

A O
kind O
of O
general O
prohibition O
is O
imposed O
on O
the O
border O
. O

This O
formula O
, O
used O
by O
the O
social O
scientist O
Claus B-PER
Offe I-PER
, O
provides O
the O
entry O
into O
the O
exit O
of O
such O
almost O
objective O
processes O
as O
automation O
, O
agricultural O
chemization O
, O
wiring O
, O
etc O
. O

To O
make O
it O
tasty O
, O
however O
, O
is O
not O
much O
more O
than O
a O
residual O
hope O
of O
escaping O
the O
unstoppable O
catastrophe O
resulting O
from O
a O
generalization O
of O
the O
principle O
of O
“ O
free O
movement O
for O
free O
citizens O
” O
by O
halting O
and O
stalling O
. O

Is O
this O
utopia O
of O
voluntary O
ascension O
not O
at O
risk O
of O
succumbing O
to O
the O
ban O
of O
the O
omnipotence O
of O
the O
present O
? O

As O
the O
critical O
force O
of O
utopian O
thought O
is O
slowed O
down O
in O
the O
science O
of O
enlightenment O
, O
in O
social O
self O
- O
thematization O
the O
dimension O
of O
historical O
significance O
is O
diminished O
in O
the O
horizon O
of O
historical O
objective O
perspectives O
. O

This O
vacuum O
is O
not O
only O
a O
feedstock O
for O
ideologies O
such O
as O
those O
of O
posthistory O
, O
but O
this O
utopia O
also O
promotes O
fixation O
on O
substitute O
programs O
such O
as O
fundamentalism O
, O
regionalism O
, O
and O
feminism O
. O

It O
lacks O
the O
memory O
of O
what O
is O
undisturbed O
in O
utopian O
thinking O
, O
it O
gives O
up O
that O
utopian O
after O
- O
thinking O
that O
hits O
the O
spark O
that O
can O
ignite O
the O
light O
that O
accompanies O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
better O
society O
. O

Confronted O
with O
the O
risks O
of O
a O
risky O
society O
, O
a O
disciplinary O
organized O
scientific O
activity O
is O
objectively O
overloaded O
. O

For O
the O
increasing O
potential O
for O
destruction O
in O
nature O
and O
society O
created O
by O
the O
individual O
sciences O
themselves O
has O
its O
reason O
not O
least O
also O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
subjects O
merely O
engage O
in O
umbilical O
observation O
, O
while O
remaining O
in O
their O
ivory O
towers O
. O

In O
this O
imperative O
multidisciplinary O
cooperation O
of O
the O
natural O
, O
human O
and O
social O
sciences O
, O
science O
raises O
a O
special O
responsibility O
from O
society O
because O
of O
its O
objective O
relationship O
to O
the O
totality O
of O
the O
social O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
sociology O
has O
the O
self O
- O
critical O
task O
of O
turning O
away O
from O
its O
own O
home O
and O
acting O
contagious O
by O
this O
example O
. O

Just O
like O
a O
“ O
house O
of O
open O
doors O
” O
with O
inner O
pluralism O
, O
it O
enables O
a O
process O
of O
combining O
various O
methods O
and O
theories O
. O

The O
cognitive O
identity O
of O
sociology O
is O
by O
no O
means O
jeopardized O
by O
this O
openness O
, O
as O
the O
subject O
has O
stabilized O
itself O
organizational O
and O
its O
academic O
reputation O
seems O
to O
be O
secured O
. O

Its O
status O
as O
a O
science O
of O
interpretation O
requires O
the O
practice O
of O
extreme O
tolerance O
toward O
competing O
paradigms O
, O
different O
methodological O
approaches O
, O
and O
the O
divergence O
in O
interpretation O
of O
social O
circumstances O
. O

Because O
social O
analysis O
can O
not O
operate O
with O
an O
objective O
claim O
to O
knowledge O
. O

Rather O
, O
social O
theory O
convinces O
by O
reasoning O
, O
that O
is O
, O
by O
empirical O
triviality O
and O
interpretative O
plausibility O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
future O
of O
sociology O
lies O
in O
establishing O
a O
unity O
of O
originally O
diverging O
traditions O
: O

The O
method O
of O
experiential O
knowledge O
, O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
and O
the O
hermeneutics O
of O
the O
humanities O
, O
on O
the O
other O
. O

This O
principle O
of O
tolerance O
in O
one O
’s O
own O
home O
also O
implies O
a O
direct O
connection O
to O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
same O
street O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
strict O
cooperation O
of O
sociology O
with O
other O
social O
sciences O
, O
if O
it O
does O
not O
want O
to O
reveal O
its O
great O
goal O
of O
cognition O
, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
Horkheimer O
, O
consists O
in O
formulating O
a O
theory O
of O
the O
historical O
course O
of O
the O
era O
. O

This O
gigantic O
research O
program O
is O
only O
feasible O
if O
sociology O
advances O
into O
a O
medium O
of O
communication O
between O
the O
subjects O
of O
history O
, O
economics O
, O
anthropology O
, O
ethnology O
and O
psychology O
, O
etc O
. O
, O
which O
jointly O
engage O
in O
a O
philosophical O
fundamental O
reflection O
, O
are O
ready O
for O
a O
continuous O
exchange O
of O
individual O
scientific O
advances O
and O
systematically O
link O
the O
empirical O
research O
efforts O
with O
theory O
formation O
. O

This O
orientation O
of O
social O
sciences O
towards O
a O
historically O
and O
empirically O
meaningful O
theory O
of O
social O
sciences O
to O
be O
developed O
through O
research O
cooperation O
is O
only O
a O
first O
step O
. O

A O
second O
must O
follow O
. O

For O
in O
the O
social O
sciences O
, O
which O
are O
increasingly O
specialized O
, O
the O
subject O
of O
their O
research O
efforts O
is O
not O
only O
crumbling O
between O
the O
fingers O
, O
but O
the O
meaning O
of O
their O
teaching O
and O
research O
is O
limited O
to O
the O
craftsmanship O
of O
the O
shooter O
, O
who O
remains O
with O
his O
leaves O
, O
even O
if O
the O
water O
stands O
to O
his O
throat O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
future O
perspective O
of O
the O
humanities O
and O
social O
sciences O
lies O
in O
the O
emerging O
coalition O
of O
humanities O
. O

According O
to O
American B-MISC
historian O
Robert B-PER
Darnton I-PER
, O
a O
new O
subject O
configuration O
, O
which O
consequently O
involves O
a O
dissolution O
of O
traditional O
faculties O
and O
disciplines O
, O
leads O
to O
an O
innovation O
boost O
: O

The O
one O
- O
dimensionality O
of O
cause O
and O
event O
research O
is O
overcome O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
reality O
- O
scientific O
understanding O
of O
the O
symbolic O
cultural O
system O
as O
the O
common O
reference O
point O
of O
humanities O
. O

Let O
us O
put O
together O
: O

First O
, O
sociology O
must O
not O
only O
recognize O
itself O
as O
an O
empirical O
, O
comprehensive O
and O
critical O
social O
science O
, O
but O
also O
productively O
use O
its O
character O
as O
a O
multi O
- O
paradigm O
science O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
project O
of O
a O
restructured O
social O
theory O
requires O
interdisciplinary O
cooperation O
among O
the O
various O
social O
sciences O
subjects O
. O

Finally O
, O
thirdly O
, O
the O
science O
of O
society O
, O
by O
its O
perspective O
on O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
human O
life O
context O
, O
is O
best O
suited O
to O
assert O
a O
general O
interest O
of O
mankind O
in O
the O
dangerous O
drive O
of O
the O
magical O
learners O
of O
the O
technical O
- O
scientific O
civilization O
, O
the O
independent O
individual O
sciences O
with O
their O
particularist O
rationalities O
. O

The O
current O
task O
of O
sociology O
is O
to O
bring O
the O
sciences O
whose O
differentiation O
is O
irreversible O
to O
the O
common O
denominator O
of O
a O
multidisciplinary O
discourse O
, O
which O
seeks O
to O
solve O
a O
question O
binding O
on O
all O
: O

How O
to O
prevent O
the O
disaster O
. O

The O
elaboration O
of O
this O
existential O
question O
does O
not O
succeed O
as O
a O
genius O
of O
a O
researcher O
or O
a O
subject O
, O
but O
is O
conceivable O
only O
as O
a O
joint O
work O
of O
all O
sciences O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
science O
of O
enlightenment O
is O
quite O
the O
protagonist O
of O
a O
utopian O
program O
: O

Overcoming O
disciplinary O
boundaries O
. O

The O
indifferent O
side O
- O
by O
- O
side O
of O

is O
scientifically O

and O
as O

as O
the O

of O

their O

Mr. O

then O
divided O

In O

parts O
were O

while O
others O
were O

in O

The O
eagle O
- O
powder B-MISC
fibel I-MISC
is O
the O
prototype O
of O
a O
fibel B-MISC
form I-MISC
, O
of O
which O
so O
far O
only O
three O
specimens O
are O
known O
, O
which O
, O
as O
by O
the O
senior O
conservative O
, O
besides O
, O
all O
originate O
in O
Mainz B-LOC
. O

A O
common O
characteristic O
of O
these O
three O
disc O
fibres O
is O
that O
the O
eagle O
is O
depicted O
with O
a O
parrot O
crown O
of O
spread O
wings O
. O

This O
mixture O
of O
eagle O
and O
peacock O
has O
a O
profoundly O
Christian O
meaning O
: O

The O
eagle O
symbolizes O
the O
resurrection O
and O
ascension O
of O
Christ B-PER
, O
the O
pavon O
the O
eternal O
life O
. O

That O
this O
crowned O
bird O
was O
regarded O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
an O
imperial O
sign O
and O
became O
the O
precursor O
of O
the O
Staubish O
Reichsadler B-MISC
, O
is O
also O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
time O
classification O
. O

His O
body O
shape O
in O
front O
view O
, O
only O
the O
head O
in O
profile O
, O
apparently O
dates O
back O
to O
Islamic O
art O
in O
the O
10th O
century O
. O

Stylistically O
, O
the O
most O
beautiful O
and O
" O
quality O
- O
filled O
" O
of O
the O
three O
eagle O
fibrils O

new O
dimensions O
. O

Instead O
of O
the O
formerly O
largely O
framed O
small O
center O
, O
the O
dominant O
large O
motif O
is O
surrounded O
by O
a O
now O
narrow O
edge O
. O

Another O
clue O
to O
dating O
these O
breakthrough O
- O
worked O
email O
fibers O
to O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
11th O
century O
are O

wire O
at O
the O
roundings O
and O
pearl O
wire O
lines O
at O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
pavement O
wheel O
. O

Where O
and O
from O
whom O
the O
precious O
jewelry O
was O
made O
can O
only O
be O
guessed O
. O

Part O
of O
this O
suggests O
Byzantine B-MISC
or O
Italian B-MISC
goldsmiths O
who O
may O
have O
migrated O
to O
or O
have O
been O
in O
Mainz B-LOC
for O
a O
long O
time O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Because O
Mainz B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
high O
Middle O
Ages O
called O
the O
" O
Diadem B-MISC
of I-MISC
the O
Empire O
" O
, O
was O
in O
the O
Salier B-MISC
era I-MISC
the O
city O
with O
the O
most O
royal O
stays O
and O
possessed O
jewelry O
workshops O
of O
supra O
- O
regional O
importance O
, O
whose O
traces O
can O
still O
be O
demonstrated O
today O
on O
the O
old O
Rhine O
coast O
by O
lead O
waste O
, O
raw O
casts O
and O
semi O
- O
fabricates O
. O

Since O
the O
overwhelming O
majority O
of O
the O
jewelry O
comes O
from O
the O
mid O
- O
third O
of O
the O
11th O
century O
, O
it O
is O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
attributed O
to O
Agnes B-PER
of I-PER
Poitou I-PER
, O
Mechthild B-PER
Schulze I-PER
- O
Dörlamm O
believes O
, O
especially O
since O
underneath O
it O
is O
a O
golden O
finger O
ring O
with O
the O
image O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
Emperor O
Heinrich B-PER
III I-PER
. O

With O
the O
gift O
certificates O
issued O
immediately O
after O
the O
wedding O
on O
extensive O
lands O
and O
possessions O
, O
Henry B-PER
III I-PER
made O
her O
one O
of O
the O
richest O
- O
equipped O
queens O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
medieval O
empire O
; O
whether O
as O
an O
expression O
of O
his O
affection O
or O
foreseeable O
independent O
care O
for O
a O
" O
foreign O
" O
ruler O
, O
is O
not O
handed O
over O
. O

It O
is O
unlikely O
that O
this O
wealthy O
Empress O
would O
later O
have O
pledged O
all O
her O
jewelry O
by O
her O
own O
hand O
to O
a O
Jewish O
merchant O
. O

It O
would O
be O
conceivable O
that O
Agnes B-PER
, O
as O
a O
throne O
regent O
in O
1066 O
, O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O

of O
her O
barely O
16 O

son O
and O
successor O
to O

Henry B-PER
IV I-PER

with O
Bertha B-PER
of I-PER
Turin I-PER
, O
almost O
a O
year O
younger O
, O
officially O
gave O
the O
jewelry O
to O
her O
daughter O
- O
in O

law O
. O

Bertha B-PER
almost O
belonged O
to O
the O
family O
, O
since O
she O
had O
already O
renounced O
the O

as O
a O
young O
girl O
and O
retired O
to O
an O
Italian B-MISC
monastery O
, O
where O
she O
no O
longer O
needed O
the O
representative O
jewelry O
. O

When O
Empress O
Bertha B-PER
now O
died O
in O
1087 O
in O
Mainz B-LOC
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Henry B-PER

equipped O
his O

Roman O
campaign O
and O
had O
to O
struggle O
again O
with O
financial O
difficulties O
due O
to O
his O
numerous O

it O
could O
have O
been O
possible O
that O

these O
circumstances O
he O
had O
pledged O
the O

his O
deceased O

it O

Per O
the O

may O
be O
considered O

This O

the O

a O

singing O

a O

This O

not O

The O

has O
something O
without O
which O
the O
concert O
operations O
do O
not O
work O

of O
relationships O

In O
difficult O
choir O

Many O
people O
enjoy O
playing O
music O
with O
the O
choir O
so O
much O
that O
they O
like O
to O
perform O
as O
a O
soloist O
. O
” O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
orchestra O
has O
its O
own O
orchestra O
is O
unusual O
. O

At O
church O
concerts O
, O
otherwise O
, O
the O
musicians O
you O
need O
are O
usually O
bought O
together O
. O

Or O
engage O
an O
entire O
professional O
. O

That O
’s O
expensive O
and O
it O
’s O
not O
guaranteed O
a O
good O
concert O
. O
” O

The O
orchestra O
performs O
as O
well O
as O
the O
choir O

The O
relationships O
are O
much O
closer O
, O
and O
the O
musicians O
are O
motivating O
each O
other O
at O
concerts O
. O
” O

That O
very O
heavy O
romantic O
pieces O
, O
such O
as O
the O
German B-MISC
Requiem O
of O
Brahms B-PER
, O
with O
the O
orchestra O
consisting O
mainly O
of O

To O
Johann B-PER
Sebastian I-PER
Bach I-PER
the O
office B-MISC
has O
a O
divided O
relationship O
, O
despite O
the O
concerts O
on O
20 O
September O
and O
6 O
December O
, O
at O
which O
mainly O
works O
of O
the O
Thomas B-MISC

are O
performed O
. O

What O
disturbs O
them O
is O
translation O
. O

Every O
second O
year O
cantates O
from O
the O
Christmas B-MISC
oratory I-MISC

That O
would O
be O
every B-PER
Mattmüller I-PER
too O
boring O
. O
” O

Many O
do O
n’t O
even O
know O
that O
not O
only O
Bach B-PER
composed O
good O
and O
interesting O
music O

” O

Thus O
, O
during O
her O
14 O
years O

she O
performed O
no O

I O
want O
to O
suggest O
to O
people O
at O

how O
wide O
the O
range O
of O
different O
pieces O
is O

” O

Also O
, O
for O

not O

" O

I O
do O
n’t O
want O

This O

by O
an O

panel O
of O

“ O

” O
these O
days O
following O
a O
conference O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

Renowned O
gynecologists O
, O
obstetricians O
, O
human O
geneticists O
, O
and O
laboratory O
diagnostics O
had O
participated O
in O
it O
and O
adopted O
a O
number O
of O
further O
demands O
. O

As O
the O
conference O
leader O
, O
Professor O
Joachim B-PER
Wolfram I-PER
Dudenhausen I-PER
of O
the O
Rudolf B-ORG
Virchow I-ORG
Clinic I-ORG
of O
the O
Free B-ORG
University I-ORG
of O
Berlin O
, O
explained O
, O
the O
in O
principle O
harmless O
, O
but O
costly O
test O
, O
when O
it O
provides O
clues O
for O
genetic O
damage O
such O
as O
neural O
tube O
defects O
or O
for O
trisomies O
( O
such O
as O
the O
earlier O
Mongolism B-MISC
called O
Down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
) O
, O
leads O
to O
further O
complicated O
and O
not O
entirely O
harmless O
examinations O
for O
the O
woman O
and O
the O
unborn O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
amniocentesis O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
procedures O
are O
unnecessary O
and O
should O
be O
avoided O
by O
pregnant O
women O
. O

Just O
as O
triple O
diagnostics O
is O
handled O
today O
, O
it O
too O
often O
provides O
clues O
to O
a O
genetic O
risk O
that O
can O
not O
be O
confirmed O
with O
amniocentesis O
. O

According O
to O
Professor O
Dudenhausen B-PER
, O
these O
deficiencies O
have O
less O
to O
do O
with O
the O
difficulties O
of O
laboratory O
determinations O
that O
biochemically O
measure O
three O
child O
substances O
in O
the O
mother O
’s O
blood O
( O
alpha O
- O
fetoprotein O
, O
chorionic O
gonadotropins O
, O
and O
estriol O
) O
. O

Rather O
, O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
test O
is O
affected O
mainly O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
exact O
age O
of O
the O
unborn O
child O
is O
often O
not O
determined O
before O
the O
blood O
collection O
and O
the O
blood O
values O
then O
, O
when O
the O
child O
is O
older O
than O
suspected O
, O
predict O
a O
non O
- O
existent O
risk O
. O

Experts O
therefore O
require O
that O
the O
test O
be O
carried O
out O
only O
when O
the O
age O
of O
the O
fetus O
is O
determined O
simultaneously O
by O
ultrasound O
. O

As O
Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
added O
, O
prior O
consultation O
of O
pregnant O
women O
is O
also O
essential O
. O

It O
should O
be O
made O
clear O
to O
future O
mothers O
that O
with O
the O
test O
, O
for O
example O
, O
a O
Down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
is O
detectable O
only O
in O
six O
out O
of O
ten O
cases O
and O
generally O
only O
a O
small O
part O
of O
all O
imaginable O
inherited O
damage O
is O
captured O
. O

The O
Professor O
Dudenhausen B-PER
: O

“ O
We O
can O
not O
give O
a O
guarantee O
certificate O
for O
the O
birth O
of O
a O
healthy O
child O
. O
” O

The O
suitability O
of O
the O
test O
under O
accompanying O
consultation O
and O
ultrasound O
control O
is O
yet O
to O
be O
determined O
. O

Several O
studies O
are O
being O
conducted O
at O
German B-MISC
clinics O
, O
including O
at O
the O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
Göttingen I-ORG
, O
where O
more O
than O
10,000 O
expectant O
mothers O
have O
been O
tested O
so O
far O
. O

For O
concerns O
regarding O
the O
possible O
consequences O
of O
an O
abortion O
, O
the O
advisors O
also O
consider O
that O
the O
test O
is O
only O
applicable O
relatively O
late O
, O
between O
the O
15th O
and O
18th O
weeks O
of O
pregnancy O
. O

Here O
, O
they O
hope O
that O
the O
new O
development O
of O
a O
blood O
test O
that O
examines O
placenta O
proteins O
will O
bring O
a O
turn B-MISC
to O
the O
better O
. O

However O
, O
this O
test O
is O
not O
yet O
practical O
. O

the O

The O
intention O
of O
the O

, O
especially O
the O
British B-MISC
, O
becomes O
clear O
at O
first O
glance O
: O

transport O
the O
wealth O
of O
the O
country O
- O
then O
as O
today O
almost O
exclusively O
agricultural O
goods O
- O
by O
the O
fastest O
way O
. O

Cross O
- O
connections O
are O
hardly O
found O
. O

Despite O
the O
colonialist O
concept O
of O
transport O
, O
however O
, O
the O
path O
of O
economic O
and O
technical O
development O
of O
Argentina B-LOC
has O
been O
able O
to O
provide O
important O
impulses O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
1940s O
, O
the O
entire O
network O
had O
been O
nationalized O
by O
then O
President O
General O
Peron B-PER
. O

However O
, O
as O
in O
many O
countries O
, O
the O
railway O
industry O
has O
suffered O
in O
the O
coming O
years O
under O
the O
increasing O
competition O
of O
the O
highway O
industry O

poor O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
number O
of O
goods O
and O
persons O
transported O
, O
the O
income O
and O
public O
investments O
continued O
to O
decline O
. O

Currently O
, O
only O
eight O
percent O
of O
all O
transportation O
in O
Argentina B-LOC
runs O
by O
rail O
. O

In O
the O
past O
two O
years O
, O
passenger O
transportation O
( O
excluding O
suburban O
traffic O
) O
has O
even O
shrunk O
from O
10.7 O
million O
to O
5.3 O
million O
. O

In O
the O
sign O
of O
the O
liberal O

and O

policy O
, O
the O
maintenance O
of O
the O
rail O
system O
under O
Peronist O
President O
Carlos B-PER
Menem I-PER
has O
been O
so O
drastically O
restricted O
since O
1989 O
that O
some O
experts O
expect O
a O
collapse O
in O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Only O
with O
substantial O

– O
which O
the O
state O
is O
not O
currently O
able O
to O
finance O
– O
would O
the O
disaster O
still O
be O
avoided O
. O

The O
government O
of O
Menem O
sees O
only O
two O
ways O
out O
of O
this O
crisis O
: O

Privatization O
and O
decentralization O

most O

chapter O

Your O

is O
: O

“ O
What O

” O

Unfounded O
fears O
, O
” O
says O
American B-MISC
aircraft O
manufacturer O
Boeing B-ORG
, O
who O
has O
now O
analyzed O
more O
than O
160,000 O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
crossing I-MISC
operations I-MISC
with O
the O
two O
- O
string O
B-767 B-MISC
. O

The O
Boeing B-MISC
people I-MISC
concluded O
that O
the O
number O
of O
engines O
of O
an O
aircraft O
is O
less O
significant O
for O
its O
safety O
than O
previously O
assumed O
. O

The O
question O
of O
whether O
to O
operate O
long O
overwater O
distances O
, O
far O
from O
airports O
, O
with O
two O
- O
wheeled O
aircraft O
can O
be O
sufficiently O
secure O
, O
has O
been O
an O
exciting O
debate O
for O
years O
. O

It O
is O
immediately O
apparent O
that O
an O
aircraft O
has O
greater O
reserves O
, O
the O
more O
engines O
it O
has O
. O

Safety O
concerns O
over O
the O
" O
twin B-MISC
" O
, O
as O
the O
two O
- O
engine O
called O
in O
the O
flying O
language O
, O
were O
initially O
also O
borne O
by O
the O
licensing O
authorities O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
it O
was O
the O
rule O
that O
two O
- O
engine O
commercial O
aircraft O
should O
set O
up O
their O
routes O
so O
that O
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
engine O
failure O
they O
could O
reach O
the O
next O
evacuation O
airport O
in O
no O
later O
than O
60 O
minutes O
. O

Thus O
, O
routes O
such O
as O
the O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
route I-MISC
were O
initially O
largely O
closed O
for O
two O
- O
track O
jets O
such O
as O
the O
Airbus B-MISC
or O
the O
Boeing-767 B-MISC
. O

The O
necessary O
circumnavigations O
over O
Greenland B-LOC
and O
Newfoundland B-LOC
cost O
additional O
flight O
time O
and O
made O
it O
impossible O
to O
operate O
economically O
. O

Under O
pressure O
from O
manufacturers O
and O
airlines O
, O
which O
promised O
economic O
benefits O
from O
the O
cost O
- O
effective O
use O
of O
the O
two O
- O
rayers O
on O
long O
distances O
, O
these O
provisions O
were O
gradually O
relaxed O
. O

The O
current O
" O
ETOPS B-MISC
" O
rules O
for O
the O
" O
Extended O
Twin O
Operations O
" O
, O
the O
" O
Extended O
Use O
of O
Two O

rayers O
" O
, O
give O
the O
captain O
of O
a O
two O
- O
engine O
commercial O
aircraft O
the O
opportunity O
to O
move O
away O
from O
the O
nearest O
landing O
site O
for O
up O
to O
180 O
flight O
minutes O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
two O
- O
ray O
aircraft O
, O
such O
as O
the O
long O
- O
distance O
Airbus O
A B-MISC
310 I-MISC
- O
300 O
or O
the O
Boeing-767 B-MISC
, O
are O
open O
to O
almost O
all O
overwater O
routes O
worldwide O
, O
except O
for O
some O
Pacific B-MISC
routes I-MISC
. O

The O
new O
180 O
- O
minute O
regulation O
has O
also O
prompted O
safety O
- O
conscious O
airlines O
, O
who O
previously O
did O
not O
want O
to O
know O
about O
the O
use O
of O
the O
twins O
on O
long O
overwater O
distances O
, O
to O
send O
the O
cheaper O
flying O
two O
- O
ray O
aircraft O
on O
long O
distances O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
the O
mid-1980s O
, O
Lufthansa B-ORG
developed O
a O
study O
on O
this O
question O
by O
means O
of O
an O
elaborate O
plan O
: O

650 O

, O
existing O
only O
on O
paper O
aircraft O
, O
were O
allowed O
to O
fly O
over O
the O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
. O

The O
result O
at O
the O
time O
: O

“ O
In O
the O
foreseeable O
time O
, O
a O
regular O
, O
timely O
, O
economical O
and O

operation O
of O
two O
- O
wheel O
jets O
on O
the O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
routes I-MISC
is O
not O
feasible O
. O
” O

Meanwhile O
, O
Lufthansa B-ORG
has O
radically O
changed O
its O
mind O
on O
this O
issue O
- O
under O
the O
impression O
of O
liberalized O
licensing O
regulations O
, O
considering O
a O
significantly O
increased O
reliability O
of O
modern O
engines O
, O
but O
also O
under O
the O
growing O
cost O
pressure O
. O

Today O
, O
the O
German B-MISC
state O
line O
operates O
on O
routes O
such O
as O
Munich O
- O
New B-MISC
York I-MISC
, O
Düsseldorf B-MISC
- I-MISC
Chicago I-MISC
or O
Frankfurt B-LOC
( O
Main B-LOC
) O
- O
Newark B-LOC
with O
two O
- O
wheel O
long O
- O
distance B-MISC
airbuses I-MISC
of O
the O
type O
A B-MISC
310 I-MISC
- O
300 O
. O

Currently O
, O
Lufthansa B-ORG
routes O
around O
a O
quarter O
of O
its O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
services I-MISC
to O
the O
United O
States B-LOC
with O
twins O
. O

Even O
more O
strongly O
, O
the O
U.S. B-MISC
airlines O
, O
which O
, O
following O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
traditional O
Pan B-ORG
Am I-ORG
and O
the O
widespread O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
TWA B-ORG
, O
are O
flying O
the O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
routes I-MISC
to O
Europe B-LOC
on O
low O

cost O
twins O
. O

Companies O
such O
as O
Delta B-ORG
, O
USAir B-ORG
, O
United B-ORG
, O
and O
American B-ORG
mainly O
use O
double O
- O
rail O
routes O
on O
Atlantic B-MISC
routes I-MISC
. O

These O
aircraft O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
make O
significantly O
more O
transatlantic B-MISC

operations I-MISC
for O
U.S. I-MISC
airlines I-MISC
than O
all O
three- O
and O

combined O
. O

The O
manufacturer O
Boeing B-ORG
, O
whose O
B-767 B-MISC
is O
now O
the O
most O
flown O
model O
by O
U.S. B-MISC
carriers I-MISC
on O
the O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
route I-MISC
, O
naturally O
sees O
this O
development O
with O
pleasure O
and O
is O
probably O
spreading O
confident O
figures O
about O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
twins O
. O

Every O
month O
, O
Boeing B-ORG
estimates O
, O
767 O

cross O
the O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
four O
thousand O
times O
. O

Of O
the O
160,000 O

now O
investigated O
, O
there O
were O
only O
56 O
" O

in O
which O
the O

, O
controlling O
an O

, O
or O
continuing O
to O
fly O
as O
scheduled O
despite O
the O
problem O
. O

Such O
an O
“ O

” O
may O
be O
a O
hard O
drive O
failure O
that O
will O
inevitably O
result O
in O
landing O
at O

but O
also O
a O
false O
triggered O
fire O
alarm O
in O
one O

or O
another O

. O

In O
only O
24 O
of O
the O
56 O
cases O
mentioned O
, O
Boeing B-ORG
says O
, O
the O
need O
for O
an O
evacuation O
or O
reversal O
arose O
. O

Basically O
, O
the O
manufacturer O
has O
only O
good O
things O
to O
tell O
its O
cost O
- O
conscious O
customers O
, O
airlines O
: O

Statistically O
speaking O
, O
one O
can O
fly O
a O

for O
11,000 O

without O
having O
to O
experience O
an O

" O
, O
a O
security O

technical O

And O
statistically O
, O
even O
20,000 O
flight O
hours O
go O
by O
before O
the O

must O
reverse O
over O
the O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
for O
the O
first O

due O
to O
a O

problem O
. O

Beyond O
these O
numbers O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
also O
true O
that O
the O
passengers O
on O
board O
a O
three- O
or O

can O
probably O
rest O
a O
little O
more O

about O
this O
sculpture O
by O
Belgian O
sculptor O
Constantin B-PER
Meunier I-PER
( O
1831 O
- O

) O
is O
as O
follows O
: O

“ O
What O
does O
he O
present O
? O

The O
right O
leg O

of O
course O

And O
otherwise O
? O

The O
" O
Debardeur O
" O
, O
as O
the O
figure O
created O
in O
1883 O
is O
called O
, O
stands O
with O
both O
legs O
in O
a O
crisis O
of O
art O
whose O
authenticity O
and O
social O
claim O
artists O
such O
as O
Meunier B-PER
or O
his O
far O
more O
famous O
companion O
van B-PER

have O
struggled O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
19th O
century O

The O
clutches O

style O

the O
rigid O
ideals O
of O
neo O

, O
and O
the O
salon O
life O
of O
the O
Bohemians O
seemed O
inappropriate O
to O
the O
human O
reality O
they O
experienced O
. O

Meunier B-PER
's I-PER
response O
to O
this O
was O
his O
radical O
retreat O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
, O
to O
the O
modeling O
of O
workers O
' O
figures O
. O

He O
was O
not O
concerned O
with O
the O
depiction O
of O
the O
misery O
in O
which O
the O
proletariat O
had O
fallen O
through O
the O
industrialization O
, O
which O
was O
not O
yet O
socially O
acceptable O
at O
the O
time O
. O

He O
created O
realistic O
worker O
figures O
that O
, O
with O
a O
certain O
pathos O
, O
embody O
unbreakable O
power O
, O
pride O

took O

came O
into O
a O

opposition O

No O

seems O
to O

Hermann B-PER
Schmidt I-PER
suspects O
another O
cause O
: O

The O
castle O
was O
formerly O
a O
playground O

bowl O
. O

Schmidt B-PER
, O
the O
son O
of O
a O
stone O
carpenter O
, O
said O
according O
to O
a O
1976 O
report O
that O
the O

had O
been O
constantly O
polluted O
and O
therefore O
left O
there O

The O
Schwanheimer B-MISC

know O
: O

He O
built O
the O
well O
in O
1938 O
. O

The O
path O

the O

appearance O
was O
only O
a O
few O
meters O
long O
. O

Reconstructed O
on O
the O
Market O
Square O
, O
it O
was O
quiet O
around O
the O
Brüning B-MISC

Water O
Game O
. O

In O
1949 O
a O
newspaper O
wrote O
: O

It O

him O

Thus O

almost O
looks O

George B-PER
, O
” O
the O
man O
thinks O
. O

The O
old O
man O
has O
many O
four O
- O
legged O
friends O
in O
Niederrad B-LOC
, O
and O
he O
knows O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
them O
. O

Slowly O
he O
bends O
to O
the O
dog O
and O
speaks O
lambfromm O
. O

George B-PER
washes O
his O
forehead O
with O
his O
tongue O
. O

The O
lady O
discolored O
and O
rubbed O
on O
the O
rope O
. O

This O
does O
n’t O
like O
the O
“ O
sweeper O
” O
at O
all O
. O

He O
has O
found O
a O
new O
friend O
, O
and O
he O
wants O
to O
keep O
him O
. O

It O
smells O
so O
related O
. O

He O
quickly O
pulls O
up O
the O
big O
snail O
and O
fixes O
it O
again O
. O

And O
only O
the O
head O
of O
the O
new O
friend O
looks O
smiling O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
. O

So O
that O
the O
lady O
does O
n’t O
do O
stupid O
things O
, O
the O
old O
man O
says O
: O

“ O
Keep O
quiet O
, O
I O
’m O
talking O
to O
George B-PER

” O

And O
then O
the O
little O
lady O
sees O
her O
dog O
swallowing O
her O
nose O
, O
and O
the O
man O
joyfully O
says O
goodbye O
to O
George B-PER

The O
man O
washes O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
the O
young O
lady O
goes O
on O
shaking O
her O
head O
. O

And O
if O
she O
should O
read O
and O
confirm O
her O
strange O
experience O
, O
it O
will O
be O
explained O
to O
her O

Good O
News O
from O
Peter B-PER
Peters I-PER

Our O
vacation O
was O
wonderful O
! O

They O
seem O
to O
have O
finally O
built O
the O
cleaning O
plant O
, O
so O
that O
the O
water O
on O
the O
" O
Playa B-LOC
Paraiso I-LOC
" O
- O
this O
is O
our O
holiday O
paradise O
for O
many O
years O
- O
is O
no O
longer O
so O
dull O
and O
there O
was O
no O
ban O
on O
bathing O
anymore O
. O

It O
is O
said O
that O
the O
cleaning O
plant O
is O
just O
a O
rumor O
, O
and O
the O
sewage O
is O
now O
only O
being O
drawn O
to O
the O
neighboring O
bay O
, O
where O
the O
fishing O
village O
of O
San B-LOC
Felipiano I-LOC
is O
located O
. O

We O
go O
there O
anyway O
no O
longer O
to O
eat O
, O
the O
fish O
last O
tastes O
more O
and O
more O
fader O
, O
and O
the O
waiters O
became O
more O
and O
more O
unfriendly O
and O
once O
even O
really O
disappointing O
, O
when O
Heinz B-PER
got O
a O
goat O
- O
tasting O
languste O
and O
even O
just O
wanted O
to O
pay O
accordingly O
. O

This O
time O
we O
have O
been O
to O
" O
La B-LOC
Matalla I-LOC
" O
, O
the O
northern O
tip O
of O
our O
bay O
, O
which O
they O
have O
just O
built O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
cute O
, O
small O
bungalow O
village O
with O
diving O
school O
, O
disco O
, O
two O
restaurants O
and O
a O
shopping O
center O
. O

In O
the O
past O
there O
were O
some O
awful O
barracks O
, O
which O
they O
sprang O
away O
with O
a O
little O
forest O
and O
some O
rocks O
that O
were O
in O
the O
way O
, O
and O
then O
dumped O
all O
the O
debris O
into O
the O
sea O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
San B-LOC
Felipiano I-LOC
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
these O
annoying O
, O
ugly O
sea O
birds O
that O
previously O
nested O
there O
have O
also O
disappeared O
. O

Supposedly O
they O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
very O
rare O
, O
but O
last O
year O
there O
were O
still O
enough O
of O
them O
to O
get O
me O
to O
sleep O
with O
their O
cradle O
for O
three O
nights O
in O
a O
row O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
they O
have O
enclosed O
the O
entire O
bay O
around O
the O
" O
Playa B-LOC
Paraiso I-LOC
" O
, O
so O
that O
now O
this O
whole O
creature O
does O
not O
come O
to O
the O
beach O
to O
sell O
or O
steal O
anything O
. O

They O
had O
become O
more O
and O
more O
, O
as O
it O
is O
said O
, O
because O
the O
unemployment O
rate O
in O
the O
region O
is O
said O
to O
be O
over O
40 O
percent O
. O

So O
, O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
that O
. O

There O
is O
really O
enough O
to O
do O
in O
our O
holiday O
bay O
, O
especially O
for O
people O
who O
are O
not O
too O
fine O
to O
learn O
a O
few O
words O
German B-MISC
. O

Although O
the O
security O
staff O
is O
already O
quite O
large O
, O
I O
’ve O
read O
that O
they O
’re O
still O
looking O
for O
people O
. O

Even O
with O
the O
faster O
removal O
of O
the O
bottles O
and O
bottles O
that O
lie O
around O
many O
places O
, O
one O
could O
employ O
some O
working O
willingness O
. O

It O
’s O
hard O
to O
believe O
how O
linguistically O
handicapped O
most O
locals O
are O
here O
! O

With O
the O
guy O
who O
previously O
operated O
the O
Kegelbahn O
- O
Kneipe O
, O
the O
communication O
was O
so O
difficult O
that O
we O
finally O
had O
no O
desire O
to O
go O
. O

No O
wonder O
the O
guy O
failed O
. O

An O
ingenious O
Hanoverer B-MISC
then O
bought O
the O
store O
quite O
cheaply O
, O
and O
now O
it O
has O
become O
so O
comfortable O
that O
we O
have O
been O
there O
at O
least O
five O
times O
. O

It O
was O
also O
very O
nice O
. O

To O
see O
Antonio B-PER
again O
, O
although O
in O
part O
he O
no O
longer O
seemed O
quite O
as O
joyful O
as O
before O
. O

He O
is O
now O
helping O
us O
out O
nearby O
in O
an O
imbißbude O
. O

His O
office O
in O
San B-LOC
Felipiano I-LOC
, O
where O
Isabel B-PER
met O
him O
at O
the O
time O
, O
has O
entered O
, O
and O
he O
now O
probably O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
debt O
. O

And O
somehow O
he O
also O
has O
trouble O
because O
of O
his O
mother O
, O
who O
, O
what O
I O
did O
n’t O
even O
know O
, O
must O
have O
lived O
in O
one O
of O
those O
barracks O
where O
now O
God B-PER
thank O
you O
is O
La B-LOC
Matalla I-LOC
. O

She O
went O
to O
court O
for O
some O
dismissal O
, O
then O
had O
a O
sort O
of O
nervous O
breakdown O
and O
is O
now O
said O
to O
be O
in O
a O
psychiatric O
clinic O
in O
the O
country O
. O

We O
showed O
Antonio B-PER
a O
few O
beautiful O
pictures O
from O
Germany B-LOC
for O
comfort O
. O

Then O
he O
wanted O
to O
come O
to O
visit O
us O
and O
see O
if O
he O
could O
find O
a O
job O
. O

Of O
course O
it O
does O
not O
. O

First O
, O
Isabel B-PER
is O
now O
together O
with O
Mario B-PER
, O
second O
, O
Heinz B-PER
has O
arranged O
our O
guest O
room O
in O
the O
style O
of O
San B-LOC
Felipiano I-LOC
, O
as O
it O
was O
before O
, O
and O
thinks O
that O
Antonio B-PER
would O
only O
get O
home O
pain O
and O
depression O
there O
, O
and O
third O
, O
the O
good O
boy O
must O
now O
really O
take O
care O
of O
his O
poor O
, O
old O
mother O

The O

from O
the O

of O
which O
today O
only O

The O
history O
of O
the O

goes O
back O
to O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
. O

It O
is O
mentioned O
in O
1232 O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

In O
1348 O
Johann B-PER
von I-PER
Goldstein I-PER
took O
over O
the O
estate O
, O
which O
from O
now O
on O
bears O
his O
name O
. O

Johann B-PER
did O
not O
care O
much O
about O
the O
building O
ordinances O
of O
Emperor O
Ludwig B-PER
: O

He O
prescribed O
that O
no O
bourg O
- O
like O
buildings O
should O
be O
built O
within O
a O
five O
- O
mile O
zone O
around O
the O
city O
. O

This O
is O
what O
Johann B-PER
von I-PER
Goldstein I-PER
did O
. O

He O
drew O
walls O
around O
his O
new O
home O
, O
filled O
a O
fortification O
pit O
with O
water O
, O
which O
he O
redirected O
from O
the O
nearby O
Schwarzbach B-LOC
, O
and O
built O
a O
drag O
bridge O
next O
to O
the O
Watchtower O
. O

In O
short O
: O

From O
the O
modest O
courtyard O
property O
became O
a O
water O
castle O
, O
which O
was O
to O
withstand O
a O
conquest O
. O

The O
City O
Council O
of O
Frankfurt B-LOC
was O
all O
but O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
accomplished O
facts O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
enthusiastic O
Burgenbauer O
came O
glimpsefully O
from O
it O
. O

Although O
the O
town O
fathers O
had O
the O
right O
to O
demolish O
the O
castle O
, O
they O
granted O
it O
to O
Johann B-PER
von I-PER
Goldstein I-PER
. O

After O
the O
death O
of O
the O
castler O
, O
around O
1400 O
the O
city O
acquired O
the O
estate O
for O
800 O
Gulden O
. O

About O
150 O
years O
later O
, O
Markgrave O
Achilles B-PER
of I-PER
Brandenburg I-PER
burned O
down O
the O
fortress O
: O

In O
the O
mid-16th O
century O
, O
Achilles B-PER
was O
on O
retreat O
in O
the O
Schmalkalde B-MISC
War I-MISC
after O
a O
failed O
siege O
of O
Frankfurt B-LOC
. O

In O
his O
anger O
he O
infected O
the O
castle O
, O
which O
broke O
from O
there O
. O

In O
the O
18th O
century O
, O
the O
remaining O
buildings O
were O
inhabited O
by O
forsterns O
until O
Jakob B-PER
Grein I-PER
in O
1818 O
inherited O
the O
Hofgut B-LOC
Goldstein I-LOC
. O

He O
expanded O
it O
into O
an O
agricultural O
farm O
with O
stalls O
and O
a O
winemaking O
house O
. O

In O
1839 O
he O
built O
the O
mansion O
, O
which O
today O
stands O
as O
the O
only O
witness O
of O
the O
time O
- O
renovated O
and O
protected O
by O

- O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
old O

facility O
and O
serves O
as O
a O
meeting O
place O
for O
the O
seniors O
. O

Not O
everyone O
agreed O
when O
the O
city O
parliament O
decided O
almost O
20 O
years O
ago O
to O
demolish O
the O
farm O
to O
accommodate O
137 O
old O
houses O
. O
” O

In O
1975 O
, O
some O
citizens O
protested O
, O
however O
, O
who O
had O
to O
watch O
the O
historic O
building O
being O
leveled O
by O
excavators O

Although O
the O

demolition O
was O
controversial O
, O
today O
only O
a O

regret O
the O

Finally O

be O
reduced O
to O
a O
capacity O

six O

Also O
, O
it O
would O
make O
sense O
to O
use O
the O
rainwater O
that O
accumulates O
on O
the O
flat O
roofs O
of O
schools O
for O
the O
toilet O
washing O
( O
which O
in O
any O

swallow O
most O

not O

as O
before O

Approximately O
440,000 O

annually O
by O

Using O
the O
example O
of O
an O
average O

a O

, O
the O
study O
shows O
how O
to O
save O

with O
little O
financial O

With O
the O
installation O
of O

, O
3,000 O

year O
can O
be O
saved O
in O
any O
establishment O
. O

If O
you O
focus O
on O
using O
rainwater O
for O
the O
toilets O
, O
you O
can O
even O
save O
almost O
7,000 O

a O

. O

However O
, O
the O
cost O
of O

would O
be O

, O
the O

must O
pay O
two O
million O

If O
one O
were O
willing O
to O
fully O
exploit O
the O
proposed O
savings O
and O
substitution O
possibilities O
( O
i.e. O
the O
replacement O
of O
drinking O

with O

) O
, O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
to O

268,000 O

Antoine B-PER
Furetière I-PER

admirable O

at O
the O

also O
to O
an O
impoverishment O

which O
, O
as O
Diderot B-PER
suspected O
, O
should O
be O
fully O
aware O
of O
the O
French B-MISC
romance O

Furetière B-PER
is O
best O
known O
today O

the O

is O
now O
present O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
well O

advised O
German B-MISC

satirical O
, O
even O
caricatural O
drawing O
, O
if O
not O
the O
listing O

They O
push O
into O
the O
vacuum O
that O
the O
empowered O

forced O
nobility O
has O
left O
behind O

where O
they O
now O
play O
a O
role O
that O

them O

nothing O

wealth O

pretension O

Molière B-PER
also O
sometimes O
finds O
a O
reflection O
of O
this O
. O

The O
two O
books O
of O
this O
so O
- O
called O
novel O
, O
in O
which O
Furetière B-PER
delightfully O
and O
funnyly O
drives O
his O
narrative O
play O
with O
the O
reader O
and O
his O
literary O
expectations O
, O
are O
actually O
two O
different O
studies O
of O
the O
environment O
and O
character O
, O
but O
in O
the O
end O
one O
also O
understands O
that O
this O
work O
, O
besides O
the O
Roman O
Comique O
of O
Scarron B-PER
and O
the O
Histoire O

de O

completely O
unknown O

Furetière B-PER

badly O

, O
always O

both O

in O
the O

here O
Furetière B-PER
grabs O
the O
fabric O
that O
lies O
around O

something O
that O

The O
Federal B-MISC
Water I-MISC

Act I-MISC
sets O
these O
limit O

for O
each O

and O
determines O
the O
" O
state O

" O
to O
be O
observed O
in O

. O

Even O
below O
this O
limit O
, O
which O
, O
for O
example O
, O
for O
mercury O
is O
0.05 O
milligrams O
per O

, O
the O
initiator O
must O
pay O
a O
wastewater O
tax O
as O
a O
type O
of O
penalty O
tax O
to O
the O
corresponding O
federal O
state O
. O

Only O
below O
a O
threshold O
set O
by O
the O
Wastewater O
Tax O
Act O
, O
the O
introduction O
is O
free O
of O
charge O
. O

For O
mercury O
, O
this O
value O
is O
one O
microgram O
per O
liter O
. O

Since O
the O
operator O
must O
explain O
in O
advance O
the O
quantity O
it O
is O
expected O
to O
inject O
and O
there O
are O
precise O
limit O
values O
for O
this O
, O
it O
also O
has O
no O
possibility O
to O
underestimate O
the O
limit O
values O
by O
illegal O
dilution O
of O
the O
wastewater O
. O

So O
that O
the O
laws O
are O
not O
just O
on O
paper O
, O
the O
initiators O
are O
forced O
to O
self O
- O
control O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
is O
supervised O
by O
the O
authorities O
. O

The O
payment O
of O
the O
wastewater O
tax O
is O
liked O
to O
be O
interpreted O
by O
critics O
as O
" O
free O
purchase O
" O
; O
in O
fact O
, O
one O
kilogram O
of O
mercury O
contains O
" O
50 O

" O
, O
with O

If O

, O
there O
is O
a O
discount O
of O
75 O

in O

so O
that O

; O
only O
with O

this O

The O

that O

Toyota B-ORG

as O
the O

Although O
it O
is O
ordered O
in O

not O

because O
of O
the O

as O

However O
, O
the O
absence O
of O

will O
not O
last O
long O

Next O
spring O

postpone O
the O

so O
that O
then O
the O
attack O

If O

it O
would O

It O
is O
primarily O
the O
internal O

matter O

with O
the O

continues O
with O

at O
a O
surprisingly O
high O

The O

of O

It O
perfectly O
meets O
the O

The O

be O
quite O
tight O

without O

The O

exemplifiably O
easy O

With O
this O

the O

the O

appointing O

with O
Anand B-PER
Panyarachun I-PER

he O
made O

, O
resistance O

formed O
this O

under O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
popular O
former O
mayor O
of O
Bangkok B-LOC

Chamlong B-PER
Srimuang I-PER
. O

The O
country O
’s O
economic O
recovery O
, O
which O
is O
limited O
to O
the O
cities O
, O
has O
created O
a O
self O
- O
conscious O
middle O
class O
that O
no O
longer O
sees O
its O
future O
in O
autocratism O
, O
but O
in O
democracy O
. O

In O
the O
60 O
years O
of O
so O
- O
called O
democracy O
, O
generals O
have O
held O
the O
post O
of O
prime O
minister O
for O
46 O
years O
. O

The O
protesters O
did O
not O
want O
to O
accept O
this O
. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
, O
not O
only O
the O
students O
, O
but O
the O
Yuppies O
, O
young O
businessmen O
and O
decent O
middle O

class O
housewives O
revolted O
against O
the O
army O
. O

Only O
a O
word O
of O
power O
by O
the O
king O
ended O
the O
bloodshed O
in O
the O
streets O
of B-LOC
Bangkok I-LOC
. O

Suchinda B-PER
had O
to O
go O
, O
lives O
today O
, O
protected O
by O
his O
fellow O
officers O
, O
comfortably O
underground O
and O
has O
so O
far O
escaped O
responsibility O
. O

Almost O
after O
his O
fall O
, O
a O
man O
would O
have O
again O
become O
the O
head O
of O
the O
military O
government O
if O
the O
king O
had O
not O
again O
intervened O
. O

Thus O
, O
Anand B-PER
took O
over O
the O
post O
of O
transitional O
prime O

for O
the O
second O
time O
to O
help O
Thailand B-LOC
adopt O
a O
new O

and O
hold O

on O

That O
the O
enormous O
influence O
of O
the O
military O
must O
be O
curtailed O
, O
almost O
all O
Thai B-LOC
civilians O
agree O
. O

The O
army O
is O
practically O
a O
state O
in O
the O
state O
, O
and O
that O
is O
, O
the O
decisive O
one O

It O
not O

in O
the O

of O
the O

, O
there O
is O
virtually O
nothing O
profitable O
in O
which O
the O
military O
would O
not O
be O
involved O
. O

Since O
the O
former O
Prime O
Minister O
Chatichai B-PER
has O
released O
all O
of O
Indochina B-LOC
as O
a O
huge O
marketplace O
, O
the O
military O
has O
also O
operated O
on O
the O
frontline O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
profits O
. O

On O
every O
350 O
soldiers O
in O
the O
280,000 O

comes O
a O
general O

to O
be O

. O

In O
Western O
armies O
, O
the O
ratio O
is O
approximately O
1:4000 O
. O

For O
the O
elections O
in O
September O
, O
the O
military O
once O
again O
expects O
good O
chances O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
rural O
majority O
is O
quite O
behind O
the O

They O
have O

quite O
popular O
as O

the O

, O
a O
group O
of O
authors O
around O
Dr. O
Nancy B-PER
K. I-PER
Sugg I-PER
about O
how O
home O
doctors O
have O
dealt O
with O
this O
problem O
so O
far O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
primary O
care O
practitioners O
surveyed O
admitted O
that O
they O
have O
so O
far O
failed O
to O
ask O
the O
corresponding O
questions O
during O
the O
consultations O
because O
of O
the O
fear O
of O
mentally O
harming O
patients O
. O

Other O
doctors O
ignored O
the O
massively O
observed O
problem O
as O
they O
saw O
themselves O
unable O
to O
offer O
effective O
help O
to O
women O
. O

If O
the O
legally O
non O
- O
binding O
suggestions O
of O
the O
AMA B-MISC
officials I-MISC
should O
fall O
on O
fertile O
ground O
in O
the O
future O
, O
this O
passivity O
will O
not O
continue O
. O

Even O
then O
, O
regardless O
of O
the O
age O
, O
race O
and O
social O
status O
of O
the O
woman O
, O
the O
question O
of O
a O
thorough O
use O
of O
violence O
by O
the O
partner O
will O
always O
be O
included O
in O
an O
anamnesis O
survey O
corresponding O
to O
the O
state O
of O
science O
. O

If O
the O
question O
is O
answered O
yes O
– O
and O
every O
fourth O
woman O
is O
attacked O
by O
her O
intimate O
partner O
once O
in O
her O
life O
– O
then O
the O
American B-MISC
family O
doctors O
should O
immediately O
discuss O
their O
safety O
with O
the O
affected O
women O
and O
provide O
them O
with O
written O
information O
material O
explaining O
the O
legal O
situation O
, O
the O
possibility O
of O
protection O
in O
women O
’s O
homes O
and O
existing O
municipal O
or O

intervention O

This O
recommendation O
of O
the O

also O
became O
necessary O
, O
according O
to O
Roy B-PER
Schwarz I-PER
, O
vice O

because O
in O

Because O
there O

one O
of O
the O
most O

The O
fact O
that O

has O
not O
been O
much O

so O
far O
, O
however O
, O
the O

is O
due O

a O
rather O
unfavorable O

as O

in O
the O

– O
at O

until O

Dr. O

in O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
Frankfurt B-ORG

that O

of O

time O

been O
in O
France B-LOC
" O
to O

himself O
to O

Whatever O
the O
case O
, O
Lersner B-PER
originated O
from O
a O
Marburg B-MISC
and O
Kassel B-MISC
family O
of O
jurists O
, O
who O
were O
nobled O
in O
1522 O
by O
Charles B-PER

, O
admitted O
in O
1566 O
by O
the O
Patriziergesellschaft B-ORG
Alten I-ORG
- O
Limpurg O
and O
about O
100 O
years O
later O
elevated O
to O
the O
Reich O
Freeräerstand O
. O

At O
the O
age O
of O
34 O
, O
Lersner O
married O
Anna B-PER
Rosine I-PER
Steffan I-PER
von I-PER
Cronstetten I-PER
and O
, O
after O
her O
early O
death O
, O
in O
1699 O
, O
Anna B-PER
Sybilla I-PER
Ochs I-PER
. O

This O
second O
marriage O
led O
to O
long O
- O
standing O
clashes O
with O
the O
Old B-PER
Limpurgs I-PER
, O
who O
had O
played O
a O
leading O
role O
in O
the O
city O
government O
since O
the O
15th O
century O
. O

In O
1715 O
he O
was O
elected O
to O
the O
city O
council O
- O
due O
to O
his O
" O
decisive O
abilities O
" O
. O

Three O
years O
later O
, O
he O
also O
found O
re O
- O
entry O
with O
the O
Old B-PER
Limpurgers I-PER
. O

In O
1721 O
Lersner B-PER
took O
over O
the O
post O
of O
a O
younger O
mayor O
. O

However O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
all O
the O
office O
deals O
, O
he O
had O
time O
to O
diligently O
continue O
to O
collect O
materials O
for O
a O
second O
chronicle O
volume O
. O

In O
1723 O
he O
became O
a O
sheriff O
and O
held O
for O
three O
years O
- O
until O
his O
death O
on O
29 O
December O
1732 O
- O
the O
dignified O
office O
of O
an O
elderly O
mayor O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
its O
significance O
is O
obtained O
by O
the O
name O
Lersner B-PER
primarily O
through O
historical O
work O
. O

Pandey B-PER
, O
who O
himself O
comes O
from O

also O
seemed O
to O
find O
it O
a O
bit O
difficult O
. O

He O
tried O
to O
identify O
the O
typical O
of O
the O
country O
in O
its O
diversity O
: O

In O
the O
country O
, O
where O
three O
times O
as O
many O
people O
live O
as O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
6,000 O
languages O
are O
spoken O
and O
“ O
innumerable O
religions O
” O
( O
pandey B-PER

are O
practiced O
. O

The O
600,000 O
villages O
face O
the O
huge O
cities O
- O
the O
conflict O
between O
the O
country O
and O
the O

turns O
into O
the O
conflict O
of O
cultures O
: O

The O
old O
, O
traditional O
culture O
shapes O
India B-LOC
just O
as O
much O
as O
the O
new O
, O
Western O
culture O
. O

It O
became O
more O
iconic O
when O
Heidemarie B-PER
Pandey I-PER
from O
the O
modern O
Indian B-MISC
women O
's O
novel O
" O
Anaro B-MISC
" O
by O
Marijul B-PER
Bhagat I-PER
las O
, O
which O
the O
couple O
Pandey B-PER
jointly O
translated O
from O
Indian B-MISC
to O
German B-MISC
. O

Here O
is O
the O
focus O
of O
everyday O
life O
: O

Anaro B-PER
, O
the O
heroine O
of O
the O
novel O
, O
works O
as O
a O
maid O
, O
lives O
in O
the O
slums O
and O
must O
take O
care O
of O
her O
little O
daughter O
, O
for O
whom O
the O
father O
does O
not O
care O
. O

However O
, O
the O
insight O
into O
Indian B-MISC
everyday O
life O
remained O
short O
and O
a O
bit O
superficial O
– O
because O
the O
audience O
probably O
lacked O
background O
information O
. O

So O
the O
evening O
over O
India B-LOC
finally O
became O
a O
reading O
, O
the O
space O
empty O
itself O
and O

The O

When O

wait O
in O

for O
a O
pregnancy O
, O
a O
disrupted O
function O
of O
the O
thyroid O

can O
be O
the O
cause O
. O

This O
was O
shown O
by O
a O
long O

study O
of O
over O
500 O

recently O

Approximately O
one O
in O
four O
women O
studied O
there O
suffered O
from O
a O
underfunction O
of O
the O
thyroid O
gland O
. O

A O
total O
of O
16 O
percent O
of O
these O
women O
became O
pregnant O
after O
being O
treated O
exclusively O
with O
thyroid O
hormones O
. O

When O
combined O
with O
other O
medications O
, O
the O
pregnancy O
rate O
increased O
to O
30 O
percent O
. O

The O
thyroid O
gland O
regulates O
the O
body O
’s O
energy O
metabolism O
and O
also O
affects O
the O
function O
of O
the O
ovaries O
. O

With O
an O
underfunction O
, O
less O
often O
also O
an O
overfunction O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
hormone O
synthesis O
of O
the O
germ O
glands O
is O
disrupted O
. O

The O
result O
is O
cycle O
disorders O
, O
with O
the O
periodic O
bleeding O
being O
especially O
strong O
and O
can O
last O
a O
long O
time O
or O
can O
be O
absent O
altogether O
. O

But O
even O
if O
the O
woman O
becomes O
pregnant O
, O
a O
thyroid O
disorder O
has O
a O
negative O
effect O
. O

In O
30 O
to O
50 O
percent O
of O
cases O
, O
abortion O
or O
premature O
birth O
occurs O
. O

In O
the O
Heidelberg B-MISC

, O
the O
rate O
of O
miscarriages O
and O
premature O
births O
was O
reduced O
to O
eight O
percent O
by O
the O
administration O
of O

. O

Experts O
therefore O
recommend O
that O
all O

He O
has O
been O
working O
in O
a O
medical O
team O
led O
by O
Prof. O
Peter B-PER
Neuhaus I-PER
for O
three O
years O
on O
the O
development O
of O
a O
new O
system O
that O
, O
similar O
to O
a O
dialysis O
device O
for O
kidney O
patients O
with O
liver O
disease O
, O
temporarily O
removes O
toxic O
substances O
from O
the O
blood O

While O
in O

an O
artificial O

filters O
out O
the O
toxins O
from O
the O

, O
in O
the O
“ O
liver O

” O
this O
is O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
liver O
cells O
of O
pigs O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
researchers O
have O
only O
tested O
the O
device O
in O
animal O
trials O
. O

Later O
, O
the O
device O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
next O
to O
the O
patient O
bed O
and O
connected O
to O
the O
human O
bloodstream O
via O
tubes O
. O

The O
blood O
flows O
through O
an O
interchangeable O
component O
that O
consists O
of O
a O
band O
of O
fine O
plastic O
tubes O
. O

On O
the O
tubes O
are O
the O
pig O
cells O
. O

They O
filter O
out O
pollutants O
from O
the O
blood O
that O
are O
either O
supplied O
from O
the O
outside O
or O
formed O
during O
metabolism O
in O
the O
body O
. O

These O
include O
, O
for O
example O
, O
phenols O
and O
ammonia O
. O

Both O
substances O
cause O
brain O
damage O
. O

The O
component O
works O
on O
average O
for O
a O
week O
. O

Then O
it O
has O
to O
be O
replaced O
with O
a O
new O
one O
with O
fresh O
pig O
cells O
. O

Researchers O
have O
so O
far O
had O
great O
difficulties O
growing O
enough O
cells O
. O

This O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
the O
Berlin B-MISC
medical O
team O
managed O
to O
do O
so O
, O
Gerlach B-PER
said O
. O

At O
least O
60 O
percent O
of O
the O
cells O
of O
a O
pig O
’s O
liver O
should O
be O
isolated O
and O
transferred O
to O
the O
plastic O
tubes O

This O
is O
the O
most O

Like O
its O

the O

also O
computer O

The O

Röhr B-PER
himself O

His O

not O

but O
is O
created O
as O
a O
reduction O
according O
to O

So O
that O
no O

are O
missing O
from O
him O
, O
the O

has O
now O
traveled O
to O

to O
take O

study O
the O
driving O
behavior O
of O
the O

he O
wants O
to O
copy O
precisely O

Excessive O
love O
for O

We O
are O
a O
society O
of O
crazy O
people O
, O
” O
acknowledges O
Chairman O
Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
. O

However O
, O
the O
Hanauer B-MISC
model O
builders O
attach O
great O
importance O
to O
one O
fine O
difference O
: O

In O
any O
case O
, O
they O
do O
not O
want O
to O
apply O
for O
pursuing O
their O
leisure O
employment O
with O
pity O
. O

That O
would O
also O
hardly O
be O
the O
right O
word O
to O
characterize O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
Bastlers O
and O
the O
Bastlers O
. O

If O
the O
men O
( O
whose O
domain O
is O
still O
modeling O
) O
tell O
enthusiastically O
about O
technical O
details O
, O
proudly O
demonstrate O
their O
little O
wonders O
, O
or O
follow O
the O
tracks O
of O
a O
model O
aircraft O
with O
the O
remote O
control O
in O
the O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
something O
in O
a O
lovable O
way O
. O

As O
" O
individualists O
who O
have O
come O
together O
through O
the O
common O
love O
of O
the O
hobby O
" O
, O
Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
describes O
the O
Hanauer B-MISC
model O
builder O
. O

Thirty O
youths O
are O
also O
members O
of O
the O
group O
, O
which O
has O
a O
total O
of O
about O
100 O
members O
. O

They O
are O
cared O
for O
by O
adults O
according O
to O
the O
individuality O
claim O
individually O
in O
the O
form O
of O
" O
small O
patches O
" O
when O
stepping O
. O

Two O
" O
factions O
" O
have O
formed O
in O
the O
model O
building O
club O
that O
has O
existed O
since O
1954 O
: O

the O
aircraft O
and O
the O
shippers O
. O

Cars O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
seem O
to O
be O
less O

- O
you O
usually O
have O
an O
" O
original O
" O
in O
the O

anyway O
. O

Many O
members O
of O
the O
association O
also O
fulfill O
a O
childhood O
dream O
in O
this O
way O
. O

Thus O
, O
Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
referred O
to O
himself O
as O
a O
" O
hindered O
major O
flyer O
" O
, O
and O
Horst B-PER
Schmidt I-PER
, O
a O
mechanical O
engineer O
, O
had O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
always O
had O
ambitions O
to O
bring O
model O
aircraft O
into O
the O
air O
. O

There O
is O
also O
this O
: O

A O
" O
real O
" O
flight O
captain O
who O
wants O
to O
relax O
while O
modeling O
. O

In O
the O
small O
replications O
he O
probably O
finds O
pretty O
much O
everything O
he O
knows O
of O
the O
big O
machines O
as O
important O
functions O
: O

Heights O
, O
sides O
, O
crossroads O
, O
land O
valves O
or O
chassis O
for O
example O
. O

However O
, O
with O
its O
fuel O
, O
a O
manned O
aircraft O
could O
not O
take O
off O
. O

Very O
small O
models O
fly O
with O
methanol O
and O
ricinus O
oil O
, O
larger O
ones O
with O
a O
lead O
- O
free O
second O
- O
act O
mixture O
. O

Unlike O
the O
ships O
, O
the O
model O
aircraft O
are O
not O
exactly O
scale O
- O
fittingly O
replicated O
. O
” O

In O
the O
reduction O
, O
they O
would O
otherwise O
have O
too O
poor O
flight O
properties O
, O
” O
explains O
Pongratz B-PER
. O

Flying O
is O
a O
chapter O
in O
itself O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
’s O
not O
without O
risk O
and O
requires O
a O
considerable O
level O
of O
sense O
of O
responsibility O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
being O
“ O
good O
steering O
and O
flying O
well O
” O
, O
says O
Pongratz B-PER
, O
“ O
two O
pairs O
of O
shoes O
” O
. O

Before O
it O
is O
allowed O
to O
take O
off O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
each O
model O
aircraft O
must O
first O
be O
" O
lowed O
down O
" O
, O
as O
Horst B-PER
Schmidt I-PER
, O
flight O
instructor O
for O
the O
beginners O
, O
explains O
. O

In O
doing O
so O
, O
it O
is O
examined O
for O
holes O
or O
unstable O
soldering O
points O
, O
in O
short O
, O
" O
for O
anything O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
a O
crash O
" O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
at O
least O
1000 O
marks O
were O
broken O
: O

" O
At O
an O
average O
weight O
of O
five O
kilograms O
and O
a O
speed O
of O
50 O
to O
60 O
hour O
miles O
, O
a O
model O
aircraft O
with O
its O
mass O
could O
hit O
through O
a O
car O
door O
, O
" O
illustrates O
Schmidt B-PER
. O

Therefore O
, O
at O
least O
two O
adults O
oversee O
the O
teenagers O
when O
they O
practice O
flying O
on O
the O
unified O
terrain O
near O
the O
Ronneburg B-LOC
. O

They O
also O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
aircraft O
, O
whose O
radius O
is O
about O
three O
to O
four O
kilometers O
, O
are O
always O
in O
sight O
. O

In O
order O
to O
minimize O
the O
risk O
to O
others O
, O
airfields O
must O
also O
be O
located O
within O
a O
prescribed O
distance O
from O
built O
properties O
. O

It O
takes O
about O
four O
to O
six O
weeks O
, O
according O
to O
Schmidt O
, O
for O
a O
beginner O
to O
master O
his O

” O

Anyone O

How O
dangerous O

is O
for O

according O

proves O
numerous O

Even O

is O
convinced O
that O

accept O

“ O

Happily O

According O

the O

The O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
made O
an O
important O
contribution O
to O
the O
consideration O
of O
the O
interests O
of O
people O
and O
the O
environment O
by O
developing O
principles O
for O
the O
resettlement O

of O

otherwise O

persons O
and O
the O
environmental O

of O
such O
projects O
for O
World O
Bank O

funded B-MISC

Similarly O
, O
the O
government O
of B-LOC
India I-LOC
has O
developed O
a O
comprehensive O
system O
to O
reduce O
environmental O
damage O
from O
public O
projects O
. O

Despite O
all O
these O
positive O
factors O
, O
however O
, O
we O
fear O
that O
the O
situation O
is O
very O
serious O
. O

We O
have O
discovered O
serious O
errors O
in O
the O
implementation O
of O
the O
Sardar O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
Sardar O

Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC
, O
as O
they O
are O
currently O
being O
planned O
and O
implemented O
, O
are O
faulty O
, O
that O
the O
relocation O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
all O
those O
who O
need O
to O
be O
forcibly O
relocated O
by O
the O
project O
is O
not O
possible O
under O
the O
given O
circumstances O
, O
and O
that O
the O
environmental O
impacts O
of O
the O
project O
are O
not O
carefully O
considered O
or O
properly O
considered O
. O

Moreover O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
is O
just O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
situation O
that O
has O
resulted O
, O
as O

The O
Sardar O

This O

a O
large O

an O

The O

The O
canal O

is O
, O
in O

of O
its O

, O
the O
largest O

extend O
over O
a O

The O

The O
Sardar O

At O

245 O

in O
the O

In O
Gujarat B-LOC

almost O
all O
those O

are O
tribal O

Many O
of O
them O
live O
“ O
illegal O

there O
, O
i.e. O
they O
have O
no O

Also O
in O
Madhya B-LOC

thousands O
of O
tribal O

live O
in O
the O

, O
many O
of O
whom O
also O
do O
not O
own O

In O
Madhya B-LOC

there O
are O
also O
many O
villages O

the O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
100,000 O
people O
living O
in O
the O

there O
are O
probably O
about O
140,000 O

the O

there O
are O
several O

live O
downstream O

under O
the O

be O
significantly O
changed O

In O
1985 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
entered O

Within O
these O
treaties O
, O
the O
World B-ORG

only O
treated O

with O
the O
right O
to O

– O
whose O

So O
our O
first O
task O
was O
to O
examine O
the O

to O
relocate O

these O

The O

, O
relates O
overall O
to O
persons O
who O
are O
“ O

. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
were O
asked O
by O

is O

The O
idea O
of O
constricting O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
dates O
back O
many O
years O
, O
but O
a O
realization O
was O
complicated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
river O
happened O
to O
three O
states O
who O
could O
not O
agree O
on O
a O
sharing O
of O
the O
project O

In O
1969 O
, O
the O
dispute O
was O
referred O
to O
the O

was O

In O

, O
he O
announced O
his O

The O

as O
the O

was O
based O
on O
28 O

Nine O
million O

for O
the O
benefit O
of O
this O

( O
an O

0.5 O

to O
Rajasthan B-LOC

The O
hydroelectric O

were O
divided O
among O
the O
three O
coastal O

The O
prerequisites O
on O
which O
the O
judgment B-PER
of O
the O

included O
a O

It O
must O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
World B-ORG

considered O
it O
necessary O

The O

all O
the O

We O
know O

no O

how O

it O
was O

The O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG

determination O
to O
do O
this O
is O
a O
testament O
to O
its O
determination O
to O
understand O
what O
went O
wrong O
with O
the O

In O
the O

way O

In O
the O
past O

people O

Compensation O

In O
1979 O
, O
the O
Narmada B-MISC

Arbitration I-MISC
Court I-MISC
in O
India B-LOC
itself O
ruled O
that O
displaced O

In O

, O
the O

found O
that O
adult O

( O
i.e. O
those O
who O

18 O

) O
should O
be O
treated O

Landless O

only O
receive O
one O

after O
this O
judgment O

India B-LOC
and O
the O
three O
states O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC

Madhya B-LOC

represent O
the O
position O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
judgment O
of O
the O
Arbitration O

, O
land O

land O
should O
only O
apply O

those O

formal O
land O

i.e. O
possess O
what O
is O

in O
India B-LOC

In O
their O
view O
, O
it O
was O
not O
the O
intent O

that O
tribal O

who O
cultivate O
land O
in O
the O

for O
which O
they O
do O
not O

a O

In O

the O

made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
not O
just O
about O
resettlement O

but O
also O
about O
rehabilitation O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
requires O
that O
in O
the O
event O
of O
relocation O

displaced O
persons O
must O
at O
least O
regain O
their O
previous O
standard O
of O

This O

In O

in O
1982 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG

developed O
principles O
specifically O
relevant O
to O
tribal O

It O
ensured O
that O
the O
traditional O

should O
be O
respected O
and O
demanded O
that O
they O
should O
only O
be O

states O
as O
well O
as O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
were O
based O
on O
the O
measures O
set O
out O
in O
the O
arbitration O
ruling O
of O
1979 O
. O

However O
, O
this O
arbitration O
was O
intended O
only O
to O
settle O
a O
dispute O
between O
states O
. O

He O
did O
not O
design O
– O
and O
can O
not O
be O
expected O
– O
measures O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
people O
affected O
by O
the O
projects O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

He O
did O
not O
even O
mention O
the O
displaced O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
nor O
did O
he O
address O
the O
people O
who O
might O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
, O
nor O
did O
he O
account O
for O
the O
cultural O
characteristics O
of O
the O
forced O
settlers O
; O
in O
the O
arbitration O
there O
is O
no O
discussion O
about O
tribal O
members O
, O
or O
land O
possession O
without O
land O
titles O
, O
or O
about O
the O
true O
meaning O
of O
‘ O
landlessness O
’ O
. O

In O
1985 O
, O
when O
the O
credit O
agreements O
were O
signed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
basis O
for O
the O
draft O
implementation O
and O
compensation O
for O
relocation O
and O
rehabilitation O
. O

The O
number O
of O
people O
who O
would O
be O
affected O
was O
not O
known O
; O
the O
extent O
of O
likely O
effects O
had O
never O
been O
considered O
; O
the O
channel O
had O
been O
overlooked O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there O
had O
been O
no O
consultation O
with O
those O
who O
were O
threatened O
by O
the O
projects O
. O

There O
were O
still O
benchmarks O
to O
check O
for O
success O
or O
failure O
. O

So O
there O
was O
also O
no O
adequate O
relocation O
plan O
, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
the O
human O
costs O
could O
not O
be O
included O
as O
a O
factor O
in O
the O
overall O
calculation O
. O

Measures O
to O
reduce O
such O
costs O
could O
not O
be O
designed O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
needs O
of O
those O
concerned O
. O

When O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
signed O
the O
Treaties O
for O
the O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-LOC
Dam I-LOC
, O
it O
adopted O
the O
definition O
of O
landowners O
displaced O
, O
i.e. O
, O
which O
did O
not O
include O
farmers O
without O
land O
titles O
. O

Moreover O
, O
she O
did O
not O
address O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
adult O
sons O
should O
receive O
land O
. O

This O
gave O
the O
possibility O
that O
most O
of O
the O
displaced O
tribal O
members O
were O
deprived O
of O
their O
possessions O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
made O
no O
separate O
precautions O
in O
the O
agreement O
for O
the O
channel O
for O
those O
who O
would O
be O
displaced O
through O
the O
channel O
or O
otherwise O
affected O
. O

As O
displaced O
were O
defined O
only O
those O
affected O
by O
flooding O
or O
the O
infrastructure O
of O
the O
project O
, O
although O
in O
1980 O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
had O
already O
admitted O
that O
in O
case O
of O
displacement O
through O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
systems O
relocation O
is O
necessary O
. O

In O
1990 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
announced O
comprehensive O
resettlement O
principles O
that O
must O
be O
generally O
applied O
to O
forced O
resettlement O
, O
and O
in O
1991 O
, O
it O
announced O
special O
resettlement O
principles O
for O
tribal O
members O
. O

These O
statements O
repeated O
the O
principles O
set O
a O
decade O
earlier O
and O
further O
differentiated O
them O
. O

These O
principles O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
reflect O
the O
general O
adoption O
of O
new O
human O
rights O
concepts O
. O

They O
acknowledge O
that O
large O
- O
scale O
projects O
, O
especially O
in O
rural O
, O
forest O
and O
settlement O
outskirts O
, O
can O
displace O
people O
as O
much O
as O
war O
or O
natural O
disasters O
. O

They O
focus O
on O
people O
displaced O
by O
development O
progress O
and O
demand O
that O
the O
human O
rights O
of O
displaced O
persons O
be O
respected O
in O
every O
project O
. O

According O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
, O
these O
are O
rights O
that O
can O
not O
be O
denied O
by O
national O
sovereignty O
or O
national O
interests O
. O

Such O
considerations O
may O
justify O
a O
project O
, O
but O
according O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
, O
they O
do O
not O
justify O
the O
cancellation O
of O
these O
human O
rights O
by O
a O
project O
. O

The O
governments O
of O
the O
three O
states O
declare O
their O
willingness O
to O
implement O
the O
arbitration O
court O

decision O
and O
to O
proceed O
according O
to O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
’s O

guidelines O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
disagreement O
about O
the O
interpretation O
. O

Gujarat B-LOC
, O
with O
4,700 O
displaced O
families O
, O
adopted O
a O
policy O
in O
1988 O
according O
to O
which O
every O
landowner O
displaced O
with O
land O
titles O
would O
be O
offered O
2 O
hectares O
of O
land O
. O

It O
also O
offers O
those O
who O
are O
classified O
as O
" O
landless O
" O
2 O
hectares O
; O
tribal O
members O
and O
others O
who O
may O
be O
working O
on O
land O
without O
land O
titles O
receive O
2 O
hectares O
of O
land O
. O

According O
to O
the O
policy O
of O
the O
Gujarats B-LOC
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
judgment O
of O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
, O
adult O
sons O
also O
receive O
two O
hectares O
. O

The O
Government O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
the O
Governments O
of O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
agree O
that O
the O
policies O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC
go O
beyond O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
and O
the O
World B-MISC
Bank I-MISC
guidelines I-MISC
. O

Maharashtra B-LOC
, O
where O
about O
3,000 O
families O
need O
to O
be O
relocated O
, O
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
, O
with O
23,000 O
families O
to O
be O
relocated O
, O
are O
ready O
to O
grant O
two O
acres O
of O
land O
to O
landowners O
displaced O
. O

But O
they O
are O
not O
willing O
to O
give O
two O
hectares O
for O
adult O
sons O
. O

Neither O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
nor O
Maharashtra B-LOC
recognizes O
any O
rights O
for O
land O
compensation O
for O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
. O

These O
differences O
in O
the O
policies O
of O
states O
have O
resulted O
in O
a O
dispute O
over O
the O
importance O
of O
arbitration O
and O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
’s O
credit O
contracts O
. O

The O
dispute O
may O
seem O
technical O
, O
but O
its O
outcome O
depends O
on O
the O
chances O
of O
thousands O
of O
forcibly O
displaced O
people O
on O
land O
to O
be O
resettled O

” O

( O
Highlighted O
by O
the O
authors O
) O

How O
can O
this O
be O
ensured O
in O
the O
case O
of O
displaced O
persons O
who O
only O
know O
agriculture O
as O
an O
occupation O
and O
for O
whom O
it O
is O
the O
heart O
of O
their O
social O
, O
economic O
and O
cultural O
life O
, O
if O
not O
by O
providing O
them O
with O
land O
to O
be O
processed O
when O
they O
are O
relocated O
? O

In O
1984 O
, O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
Control O
Authority O
, O
which O
had O
been O
set O
up O
to O
monitor O
the O
project O
, O
declared O
: O

" O
For O
tribal O
members O
, O
there O
is O
no O
more O
effective O
rehabilitation O
than O
providing O
land O
for O
subsistence O
. O
" O

We O
have O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
the O
only O
way O
to O
ensure O
that O
their O
standard O
of O
living O
improves O
or O
at O
least O
remains O
the O
same O
. O

The O
result O
of O
referring O
to O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
as O
landless O
means O
that O
people O
working O
on O
the O
land O
they O
regard O
as O
their O
own O
become O
landless O
workers O
. O

This O
is O
not O
rehabilitation O
. O

It O
does O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
live O
at O
least O
as O
well O
as O
before O
. O

The O
tribal O
members O
of O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
are O
very O
aware O
of O
this O
matter O
and O
what O
it O
means O
for O
them O
to O
be O
relocated O
as O
landless O
agricultural O
workers O
. O

When O
we O
visited O
Bamni B-LOC
, O
a O
tribal O
village O
in O
Maharashtra B-LOC
, O
people O
told O
us O
: O

“ O
We O
are O
farmers O
, O
not O
workers O
. O
” O

In O
our O
view O
, O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
have O
failed O
to O
meet O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
’s O
credit O
conditions O
because O
they O
have O
failed O
to O
provide O
adequate O
land O
for O
the O
rehabilitation O
of O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
. O

The O
states O
argue O
that O
according O
to O
the O
arbitration O
ruling O
and O
agreements O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
all O
displaced O
persons O
have O
the O
right O
to O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
where O
both O
landowners O
and O
landless O
displaced O
persons O
should O
receive O
two O
hectares O
of O
irrigated O
land O
. O

Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
therefore O
expect O
that O
many O
displaced O
people O
will O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
. O

Accordingly O
, O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
’s O
relocation O
plan O
actually O
includes O
only O
10 O
% O
of O
the O
area O
needed O
for O
relocation O
. O

But O
many O
displaced O
people O
do O
not O
want O
to O
move O
to O
Gujarat B-LOC
for O
reasons O
related O
to O
language O
, O
culture O
and O
other O
ties O
to O
the O
region O
. O

For O
many O
of O
them O
, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
major O
cultural O
shift O
. O

Both O
under O
the O
arbitration O
court O
’s O
ruling O
and O
under O
the O
agreements O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
displaced O
persons O
have O
the O
right O
to O
be O
resettled O
in O
their O
own O
state O
. O

While O
it O
is O
true O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
been O
quite O
successful O
in O
carrying O
out O
relocations O
in O
the O
last O
eighteen O
months O
, O
so O
far O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
only O
settled O
around O
3,000 O
families O
. O

The O
relocation O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
so O
many O
more O
displaced O
people O
— O
per O
15,000 O
families O
— O
from O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
, O
would O
be O
a O
huge O
task O
for O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
would O
burden O
its O
limited O
resources O
considerably O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
’s O
not O
just O
about O
relocation O
, O
it O
’s O
also O
about O
rehabilitating O
people O
. O

The O
states O
may O
be O
able O
to O
organize O
the O
physical O
relocation O
of O
thousands O
of O
families O
to O
land O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
will O
be O
able O
to O
rehabilitate O
them O
all O
. O

( O

is O

The O
only O
resettlement O
policy O
that O
all O
three O
states O
must O
apply O

that O
of O
the O
World B-ORG

But O
this O
policy O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
was O
not O
followed O
. O

The O
projects O
were O
not O
developed O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
. O

Basic O
information O
was O
not O
collected O
and O
adequate O
plans O
for O
relocation O
and O
rehabilitation O
were O
not O
designed O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
successes O
of O
Gujarats B-LOC
bzgl O
. O

For O
those O
already O
displaced O
in O
1960 O
- O
61 O
, O
when O
six O
villages O
in O
Kevadia B-LOC
were O
expropriated O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
dam O
site O
, O
no O

. O

To O
be O
safe O
, O
some O
villagers O
were O
paid O
compensation O
in O
the O
form O
of O

. O

But O
since O
1985 O
, O
these O
people O
also O
fall O
under O
contracts O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
. O

Their O
right O
to O
land O
should O
have O
been O
recognized O
seven O
years O
ago O
, O
but O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
failed O
to O
ensure O
recognition O
of O
these O
claims O
by O
Gujarat B-LOC
as O
part O
of O
the O
treaties O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
provision O
of O
appropriate O
land O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
only O
recently O
urged O
India B-LOC
— O
but O
without O
insisting O
— O
that O
India B-LOC
and O
the O
states O
should O
comply O
with O
the O
1979 O
arbitration O
on O
adult O

that O

set O

to O
meet O
the O
overall O
goal O
of O
the O
World B-MISC
Bank I-MISC
guidelines I-MISC
and O
secure O
land O
for O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
. O

However O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
not O
only O
failed O
to O
enforce O
the O
arbitration O
ruling O
and O
the O
treaties O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
channel O
, O
it O
has O
failed O
in O
so O
far O
as O
it O
has O
not O
established O
any O
binding O
regulation O
in O
its O
contract O
with O
Gujarat B-LOC
requiring O
the O
implementation O
of O
the O

What O
about O
the O
villagers O
who O
live O
in O
the O
area O
of O
the O
canal O
? O

The O
construction O
of O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
will O
affect O
140,000 O
families O
, O
of O
which O
13,000 O
— O
no O
one O
knows O
how O
many O
— O
will O
lose O
much O
or O
their O
entire O
land O
. O

People O
who O
lose O
land O
to O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
are O
offered O
compensation O
under O
the O
Land O
Acquisition O
Act O
of O
1894 O
. O

The O
number O
of O
people O
affected O
is O
controversial O
in O
the O
estimates O
. O

So O
much O
is O
clear O
: O

Acquisition O
of O
land O
under O
the O
Land O
Acquisition O
Act O
has O
often O
meant O
that O
farmers O
who O
lost O
land O
were O
compensated O
with O
amounts O
far O
below O
the O
actual O
recovery O
costs O
. O

The O
responsibility O
for O
this O
point O
lies O
clearly O
with O
the O
World B-ORG

It O
did O
not O
provide O
for O

costs O
for O

in O

. O

Growing O
respect O

The O

Sarovar I-LOC
is O
a O
history O
of O
not O

There O
is O
no O
comprehensive O
document O
on O
the O
effects O

The O
nature O
and O
extent O
of O
environmental O
problems O
and O
solutions O
are O
unknown O
. O

This O
contributes O
significantly O
to O
the O
controversy O
surrounding O
the O
project O
. O

As O
with O
relocation O
and O
rehabilitation O
, O
this O
fact O
has O
put O
our O
investigation O
in O
a O
difficult O
position O

In O
order O
to O
complete O
our O
work O
, O
we O
had O
to O
gather O
basic O
environmental O
information O
in O

to O
describe O
the O

We O
found O

information O
related O
to O
these O
works O
( O
i.e. O

and O

i.e. O
) O
. O

We O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
there O
is O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
projects O
will O
not O
work O
as O
planned O
. O

The O
problems O
relate O
to O
the O
frequency O
and O

of O

as O

as O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O

The O
effects O
of O
Sardar B-LOC

upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
inlet O
area O
will O
therefore O
be O
different O
from O
what O
is O
currently O
assumed O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
the O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC

are O
being O
built O
upstream O
as O

not O

There O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
a O
realistic O
operational O
analysis O
on O
which O
an O
environmental O

could O
be O
based O
. O

This O
has O
alarmed O
us O

it O
should O

alarm O

Despite O

it O
was O

that O
we O

statements O
from O

continue O
as O
“ O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
the O
technical O

led O
to O
the O
exclusion O

The O

However O
, O
these O

they O
make O
it O

has O
always O
been O
and O
will O
remain O
a O
decision O
of O
India B-LOC

the O

Together O
they O
spent O
a O

the O

No O

But O
we O
warn O
that O
it O
can O
be O

more O

to O
continue O
now O
without O
knowing O
exactly O
what O
it O

We O

it O
would O
be O
irresponsible O
for O

compile O

given O
the O
mistakes O
that O
the O

so O
obvious O
to O
us O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
wisest O
decision O
for O
the O
World B-ORG

would O
be O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O

Its O
photovoltaic O

, O
which O
is O
first O
converted O
into O
alternating O
current O
through O
a O
so O
- O
called O
inverter O
and O
then O
fed O
into O
the O
grid O
. O

During O
the O
first O
three O
weeks O
, O
the O
average O
electricity O
production O
per O
day O
was O
15 O
kilowatt O
hours O
( O

) O
. O

The O
peak O
result O
in O
one O
day O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER
says O
proudly O
, O
was O
21 O
kWh O
. O

That O
’s O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
the O
family O
consumes O
on O
average O
per O
day O
. O

What O
remains O
goes O
to O
the O
public O
network O
: O

For O
each O
kilowatt O
- O
hour O
that O
Kirchhoff B-PER
consumes O
, O
he O
receives O
16.61 O
pennies O
from O
the O
EAM B-ORG
. O

However O
, O
about O
one O
and O
a O
half O
times O
that O
amount O
( O
25 O
pennies O
) O
is O
collected O
by O
the O
EAM B-ORG
if O
Kirchhof O
's O
own O
production O
is O
not O
enough O
and O
he O
has O
to O
connect O
to O
the O
public O
network O
. O

He O
does O
not O
become O
rich O
by O
trading O
with O
the O
EAM B-ORG
, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
matter O
to O
him O
either O
: O

For O
ten O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
family O
set O
itself O
the O
goal O
of O
meeting O
their O
energy O
needs O
with O
environmentally O
friendly O
renewable O
raw O
materials O
. O

It O
all O
began O
with O
Heino B-PER
Kirchhof I-PER
recognizing O
his O
ecological O
" O
sins O
" O
: O

During O
the O
construction O
of O
his O
house O
, O
he O
had O
installed O
an O
electric O
floor O
heating O
. O

Electricity O
, O
" O
which O
became O
clear O
to O
him O
afterwards O
, O
" O
is O
far O
too O
precious O
to O
heat O
with O
. O
" O

So O
in O
1982 O
he O
replaced O
the O
floor O
heating O
for O
four O
brick O
ovens O
that O
are O
" O
feeded O
" O
with O
dry O
bookwood O
. O

Not O
so O
comfortable O
, O
” O
he O
says O
, O
“ O
but O
more O
ecologically O
valuable O
. O
” O

About O
three O
years O
later O
, O
the O
church B-PER
houses I-PER
installed O
solar O
collectors O
that O
heat O
the O
water O
for O
showering O
, O
washing O
and O
washing O
. O

Such O
solar O
systems O
for O
water O
heating O
are O
relatively O
cheaper O
than O
those O
with O
photovoltaics O
, O
comparing O
the O
price O
and O
the O
environmental O
benefits O
: O

" O
With O
10,000 O
mark O
, O
" O
Kirchhof B-PER
expects O
, O
" O
a O
half O
- O
kilowatt O
photovoltaic O
plant O
can O
be O
financed O
that O
saves O
about O
0.5 O
tons O
of O
carbon O
dioxide O
. O
" O

However O
, O
with O
the O
same O
amount O
can O
also O
be O
paid O
for O
a O
complete O
water O
heating O
system O
. O

And O
it O
saves O
significantly O
more O
carbon O
dioxide O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
Hessen B-LOC
, O
solar O
thermal O
is O
promoted O
primarily O
. O

According O
to O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Environment I-ORG
, O
the O
country O
provides O
subsidies O
for O
such O
solar O
installations O
up O
to O
3000 O
mark O
, O
but O
no O
more O
than O
30 O
percent O
of O
the O
cost O
. O

This O
program O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
. O

The O
church O
houses O
paid O
for O
their O
facilities O
for O
water O
heating O
from O
their O
own O
pockets O
. O

Also O
without O
subsidies O
and O
subsidies O
, O
Heino B-PER
Kirchhof I-PER
installed O
the O
first O
solar O
cells O
for O
a O
one O
- O
kilowatt O
photovoltaic O
plant O
on O
its O
roof O
. O

This O
was O
a O
sporting O
event O
: O

The O
1988 O
Tour B-MISC
de I-MISC
Sol I-MISC
in O
Switzerland B-LOC
- O
the O
world O
championship O
for O

. O

Also O
a O
team O
of O
teachers O
, O
students O
and O
students O
of O
the O
Oskar B-ORG
- I-ORG
von I-ORG
- O
Miller O
- O
Schule O
, O
at O
which O
the O
Higher O
Studienrat O
Heino B-PER
Kirchhof I-PER
has O
been O
offering O
a O
solar O
work O
community O
for O
years O
, O
wanted O
to O
start O
with O
a O
self O
- O
built O
solar O
car O
. O

However O
, O
the O
organizer O
's O
proposal O
was O
to O
generate O
the O
electricity O
needed O
for O
the O
race O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
sun O
itself O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
invested O
around O
20,000 O
mark O
to O
build O
a O
small O
solar O
powered O
power O
generator O
on O
his O
roof O
. O

This O
year O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER
then O
increased O
the O
plant O
significantly O
. O

A O
North B-MISC
Hesse I-MISC
company O
built O
a O
five O
- O
kilowatt O
photovoltaic O
plant O
to O
the O
first O
. O

The O
new O
one O
cost O
about O
130,000 O
marks O
. O

A O
costly O
commitment O
to O
the O
environment O
. O

For O
Kirchhoff B-PER
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
also O
financially O
viable O
because O
he O
is O
one O
of O
those O
150 O
Hessen B-LOC
who O
receive O
grants O
from O
the O
so O
- O
called O
1000 B-MISC
roof I-MISC
program I-MISC
. O

This O
federal O
program O
, O
which O
has O
grown O
to O
2,500 O
projects O
, O
has O
expired O
at O
the O
end O
of O
June O
. O

Until O
then O
, O
homeowners O
who O
installed O
a O
photovoltaic O
system O
on O
their O
roof O
could O
apply O
for O
investment O
aid O
of O
70 O
percent O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER
received O
1000 O
mark O
per O
kilowatt O
of O
EAM B-ORG
power O
. O

Withdrawing O
all O
subsidies O
, O
he O
had O
to O
raise O
about O
33,000 O
marks O
from O
his O
own O
pocket O
. O

Kirchhof B-PER
is O
of O
course O
pleased O
with O
the O
German B-MISC
funding O
program O
– O
not O
just O
because O
it O
has O
brought O
him O
benefits O
. O

But O
he O
is O
not O
satisfied O
: O

Although O
the O
facilities O
for O
2,500 O
German B-MISC
builders O
have O
become O
cheaper O
and O
, O
for O
some O
, O
even O
financable O
. O

However O
, O
a O
real O
breakthrough O
in O
green O
energy O
technology O
was O
not O
achieved O
because O
the O
market O
was O
not O
affected O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER
considers O
the O
support O
guidelines O
worth O
improving O
. O

Approximately O
because O
the O
American B-MISC
and O
Japanese B-MISC
modules O
, O
which O
are O
the O
cheapest O
on O
the O
market O
, O
remained O
outside O
of O
the O
program O
. O

Outside O
are O
now O
other O
photovoltaic O
interests O
, O
as O
the O
boxes O
are O
empty O
. O

The O
program O
will O
not O
be O
resumed O
for O
now O
. O

At O
current O
prices O
for O
this O
technique O
, O
the O
environmentally O
friendly O
way O
of O
producing O
energy O
, O
according O
to O
experts O
, O
is O
a O
“ O
hobby O
for O
millionaires O
” O
. O

Heino B-PER
Kirchhof I-PER
is O
not O
a O
millionaire O
. O

But O
he O
still O
considers O
it O
essential O
to O
take O
account O
of O
the O
environmental O
consequences O
– O
such O
as O

, O

Since O
the O

, O
according O
to O
Burow B-PER
, O
the O
conflict O
with O
foreign O

at O
the O
Bornheimer B-MISC
Bürgerhaus O
has O
relaxed O

There O
are O
still O
problems O

However O
, O
the O
many O
, O
background O
talks O
‘ O
show O
success O
, O
’ O
says O
Burow B-PER
. O

The O
idea O
of O
offering O
a O
round O
of O
discussions O
at O
the O
“ O
green O
table O
” O
with O
young O
people O
, O
locals O
and O
politicians O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
implemented O
. O

After O
all O
, O
however O
, O
the O
supporters O
of O
a O
“ O
hard O
line O
” O
could O
not O
persist O
, O
said O
the O
representative O
of O
Saalbau B-ORG
GmbH. I-ORG

It O
is O
important O
for O
organizers O
to O
offer O
young O
people O
meaningful O
leisure O
activities O
and O
not O
to O
exclude O
them O
. O

Permanent O
guests O
also O
in O
Bornheim B-LOC
are O
currently O
so O
- O
called O
skaters O
professionals O
from O
the O
main O

There O
are O
also O
cracks O
that O
travel O
after O
the O
skatemobile O
, O
” O
says O
Jochen B-PER
Vesper I-PER
. O

The O
audience O
is O
mixed O
: O

At O
age O
and O
at O
age O
. O

30 O
to O
40 O
skaters O
regularly O
roll O
the O
halfpipe O
up O
and O
down O
. O

Jochen B-PER
Vesper I-PER
can O
repeatedly O
observe O
that O
the O
sports O
crack O
teaches O
the O
little O
ones O
their O
tricks O
. O

Conflicts O
are O
rare O
among O
young O
people O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
sport O
sometimes O
has O
a O
martial O
effect O
on O
outsiders O
, O
skaters O
have O
a O
pronounced O
code O
of O
honor O
: O

Whoever O
lies O
on O
the O
nose O
in O
the O
pipe O
immediately O
makes O
room O
for O
the O
neighbor O
. O

This O
saves O
us O
from O
meaningless O
discussions O
about O
the O

of O

on O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O

be O
made O
clearer O
and O
therefore O
less O
dangerous O
for O

Since O
it O

After O
that O

a O

Since O
1984 O
, O
the O
renovation O
of O
the O
470 O
year O
old O

has O
been O
planned O
. O

For O
more O
than O
a O
century O
, O
the O
fence O
was O
used O
as O
a O
shed O
with O
its O
distinctive O
spitz O

. O

In O
1985 O
the O
chapel O
was O
acquired O
by O
a O
Bergen B-MISC

Enkheimer I-MISC

Currently O
, O

followed O
by O
the O
interior O

of O
the O

, O
explained O
Schmitteckert B-PER
. O

By O
the O
beginning O
of O
next O
year O
, O
he O
hopes O
, O
the O
main O
building O
will O
be O
finished O
. O

The O
main O
building O
will O
be O
connected O
by O
a O
9.5 O
meter O
long O
stretch O
with O
the O
market B-LOC
street I-LOC

. O

The O
hallway O
is O
to O
be O
partly O
glazed O
from O
the O
floor O
to O
the O
ceiling O
and O
later O
served O
as O
a O

. O

The O
chapel O
will O
be O
used O
for O
concerts O
and O
other O
cultural O
events O
. O

The O

in O
Market B-LOC

there O

a O

, O
teaching O
rooms O
and O
exercise O
rooms O
. O

Until O
there O
can O
be O
music O
, O
but O
it O
will O
take O
some O
time O
. O

That O
the O
old O
work O
is O
in O
poor O
condition O
, O
private O
architects O
had O
already O
determined O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
magistrate O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
upper O
floor O
was O
still O
inhabited O
, O
in O
the O
front O
was O
a O
kiosk O
, O
whose O
owner O
had O
to O
give O
up O
despite O
fierce O
protests O
in O
the O
district O
. O

But O
only O
after O
a O
sum O
of O
5.9 O
million O
marks O
was O
decided O
for O
the O
entire O
project O
including O
the O
chapel O
, O
the O
old O
house O
was O
again O
taken O
under O
the O
lupe O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
flawed O
, O
although O
at O
first O
– O
at O
least O
from O
the O
outside O
– O
it O
looked O
“ O
clean O
, O
” O
as O
Schmitteckert O
assured O
. O

The O
roof O
had O
to O
be O
removed O
due O
to O
collapse O
danger O
. O

If O
the O
supplementary O
cost O
application O
is O
approved O
, O
the O
project O
manager O
estimates O
it O
will O
take O
another O
year O
before O
the O
new O
construction O
can O
be O
accepted O
. O

The O
renovation O
of O
the O
three O
buildings O
, O
now O
worth O
7.3 O
million O
marks O
, O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
completed O
in O
the O
course O
of O
next O
year O
. O

The O
new O
house O
Market B-LOC

58 O
will O
then O
have O
significant O
advantages O
over O
the O
old O

This O

only O

been O
insufficiently O

The O
highest O
obstacle O
: O

In O
a O
vote O
, O
two O
- O
thirds O
of O
tenants O
must O
agree O
to O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
property O
to O
the O
cooperative O
. O

Whether O
this O
result O
can O
be O
achieved O
is O
completely O
open O
. O

In O
November O
, O
the O
tenants O
will O
decide O
on O
the O
further O
fate O
of O
the O
houses O
in O
a O
secret O
vote O
. O

Should O
this O
vote O
be O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
, O
the O
Supervisory O
Board O
of O
the O
Nassau B-ORG
Homestead I-ORG
can O
finally O
approve O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
settlement O
at O
its O
next O
meeting O
on O
30 O
November O
. O

This O
would O
end O
a O
seven O
- O
year O
political O
twist O
over O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
settlement O
from O
the O
1920s O

The O
other O
conditions O
of O
the O
Housing O
Minister O
can O
be O
fulfilled O
more O
easily O
by O
the O
cooperative O
: O

The O
country O
has O
signed O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Treaty I-MISC
. O

It O
provides O
that O
all O
apartments O
being O
liberated O
must O
be O
to O
the O
Housing B-ORG
Office I-ORG
and O
can O
be O
filled O
with O
new O
tenants O
by O
the O
authority O
. O

This O
condition O
is O
easy O
to O
meet O
, O
said O
the O
board O
member O
of O
the O
cooperative O
, O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
. O

Another O
condition O
of O
the O
Minister O
is O
to O
raise O
the O
rental O
price O
piece O
by O
piece O
up O
to O
a O
square O
meter O
price O
of O
8.50 O
mark O
. O

This O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
cooperative O
can O
operate O
profitably O
and O
that O
the O
country O
does O
not O
have O
to O
stand O
up O
in O
the O
event O
of O
bankruptcy O
for O
the O
debt O
accrued O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
according O
to O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
, O
the O
cooperative O
also O
lacks O
a O
so O
- O
called O
“ O
maintenance O
assessment O
” O
: O

In O
principle O
, O
it O
is O
intended O
to O
clarify O
whether O
a O
small O
cooperative O
can O
make O
the O
stock O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
of O
only O
1072 O
apartments O
at O
all O
profitable O
. O

If O
all O
conditions O
are O
met O
, O
the O
home O
settlement O
can O
change O
the O
owner O
for O
the O
purchase O
price O
of O
approximately O
80 O
million O
marks O
. O

The O
sum O
is O
combined O
as O
follows O
: O

The O
country O
gives O
48.3 O
million O
marks O
to O
the O
cooperative O
as O
interest O
- O
free O
contribution O
. O

This O
amount O
was O
received O
in O
1986 O
by O
the O
Nassau B-ORG
Home O
for O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
homeland O
settlement O
from O
the O
bankruptcy O
mass O
of O
the O
New O
Home O
. O

So O
the O
money O
is O
simply O
“ O
delivered O
” O
. O

The O
missing O
sum O
of O
approximately O
32 O
million O
marks O
is O
currently O
covered O
through O
mortgages O
, O
which O
would O
also O
have O
to O
be O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
new O
cooperative O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
rental O
increase O
already O
mentioned O
serves O
to O
gradually O
replace O
the O
basic O
debt O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
to O
repay O
the O
state O
subsidy O
. O

The O
lease O
union O
currently O
has O
about O
350 O
members O
. O

It O
promises O
itself O
from O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
above O
all O
a O
“ O
lease O
- O
near O
administration O
” O
, O
as O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
explained O
. O

There O
are O
no O
alienated O
working O
conditions O
, O
the O
tenants O
are O
not O
numbers O
, O
and O
in O
the O
long O
run O
they O
will O
determine O
the O
business O
policy O
, O
” O
Schneider B-PER
continued O
. O

Adequate O
control O
authorities O
have O
been O
installed O
, O
she O
assured O
, O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
tenants O
would O
again O
be O
exposed O
to O
the O
uncertainties O
, O
as O
they O
arose O
after O
the O
bankruptcy O
of O
the O
previous O
owner O
Neue O
Heimat O
. O

However O
, O
not O
all O
tenants O
seem O
to O
be O
convinced O
. O

They O
are O
satisfied O
with O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
hometown O
by O
the O
Nassauische B-ORG
Heimstätte I-ORG
and O
see O
unnecessary O
unrest O
brought O
to O
the O
Sachsenhäuser B-MISC
Wohnviertel O
through O
the O
voting O
and O
discussion O
of O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
. O

To O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
many O
tenants O
also O
contributes O
that O
the O
state O
of O
maintenance O
of O
the O
apartments O
is O
not O
good O
. O

Only O
recently O
had O
the O
gas O
pipelines O
in O
the O
settlement O
to O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
grid O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
money O
for O
repair O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
association O
are O
optimistic O
: O

" O
We O
will O
work O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
tenants O
in O
the O
required O
majority O
support O
the O
acquisition O
, O
" O
explained O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
. O

Will O
it O
succeed O
to O
inspire O
almost O
67 O
percent O
of O
tenants O
for O
the O
first O
establishment O
of O
a O
housing O
cooperative O
after O
the O
bankruptcy O
of O
the O
New O
Homeland O
? O

To O
give O
an O
answer O
to O
this O
would O
be O
to O
read O

For O
seven O
years O
now O
, O
there O
is O
a O
dispute O
over O
who O
will O
manage O
the O
settlement O
in O
the O
future O
. O

The O
clashes O
began O
in O
1985 O
, O
when O
the O
Neue B-ORG
Heimat I-ORG
Südwest I-ORG
had O
to O
sell O
its O
entire O
housing O
stock O
and O
was O
subsequently O
liquidated O
. O

Already O
at O
this O
time O
, O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
tenant O
association O
and O
the O
self O
- O
administration O
of O
the O
1072 O
apartments O
by O
the O
residents O
was O
sought O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
the O
same O
year O
was O
founded O
the O
" O
Hirtenerverein B-ORG
der I-ORG
Siedlung I-ORG
Heimat I-ORG
" O
, O
which O
soon O
numbered O
more O
than O
500 O
members O
and O
was O
to O
prepare O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
cooperative O
. O

Since O
the O
settlement O
was O
not O
intended O
to O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
speculators O
, O
it O
was O
" O
parked O
" O
at O
the O
home B-ORG
of I-ORG
Nassau I-ORG
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
Wiesbaden O
state O
government O
. O

The O
company O
received O
about O
49 O
million O
marks O
from O
Wiesbaden B-LOC
for O
the O
purchase O
and O
was O
able O
to O
cover O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
78 O
million O
marks O
by O
taking O
out O
mortgages O
- O
there O
were O
no O
financial O
expenses O
to O
the O
Nassau B-ORG
home I-ORG
. O

The O
country O
elections O
of O
April O
1987 O
brought O
a O
new O
majority O
in O
Hessen B-LOC
. O

The O
CDU O
/ O
FDP B-MISC
government I-MISC
was O
disinterested O
in O
the O
question O
of O
taking O
over O
the O
settlement O
by O
the O
co O
- O
founding O
cooperative O
. O

The O
then O
Interior O
Minister O
Gottfried B-PER
Milde I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
passed O
the O
deadline O
within O
which O
it O
would O
have O
been O
possible O
for O
the O
cooperative O
to O
take O
over O
the O
settlement O
. O

The O
Land O
Hessen B-LOC
had O
dismissed O
the O
option O
by O
time O
, O
there O
was O
no O
legal O
claim O
to O
the O
acquisition O
. O

The O
question O
that O
was O
asked O
to O
the O
Nassau B-ORG
home I-ORG
was O
whether O
it O
was O
willing O
to O
reopen O
this O
option O
. O

There O
is O
an O
absolute O
yes O
to O
this O
, O
” O
Hans B-PER
Fürst I-PER
, O
a O
spokesman O
for O
the O
Nassau B-ORG
Home I-ORG
, O
explained O
the O
recent O
decision O
of O
the O
Supervisory O
Board O
. O

In O
order O
to O
avoid O
a O
disaster O
like O
the O
New B-ORG

the O
Hessish B-MISC
Housing O
Minister O
has O
bound O
conditions O
to O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
settlement O
by O
the O
cooperative O
. O

So O
the O
path O
to O
the O
cooperative O
self O
- O
government O
models O
of O
the O
twenties O
is O
now O
basically O
open O
again O
. O

The O

built O
between O
1927 O

to O
whom O
the O

The O
“ O

” O
was O
the O
builder O
of O
the O
settlement O

As O
early O
as O
1930 O
, O
the O
settlement O
was O
largely O
managed O
by O
the O
tenants O

as O
the O

Inhabitants O
at O
the O
time O
were O
mainly O
members O
of O
the O
then O
“ O

Union O
” O
. O

But O
the O
cooperative O
model O
now O
sought O
to O
give O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
settlement O
even O
more O
opportunities O
to O
influence O
business O
policy O
than O
was O
the O
case O
with O
the O
historic O
predecessor O
" O

The O

by O

After O

Similarly O
, O
the O

of O

From O

1993/94 O

it O
is O
stated O

For O
the O

" O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
missing O
now O
is O
the O
approval O
from O

Wiesbaden B-MISC

the O

otherwise O
it O

However O
, O
no O

In O
the O

takes O
the O

During O

With O

of O
their O
city O

Ulrich B-PER

, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
initially O
attempted O
to O
enforce O
a O
motion O
in O
the O

in O
which O
they O
demanded O
that O
the O
" O

be O
stopped O
until O
enough O

So O
far O
, O
according O
to O
applicant O
Michael B-PER
Krämer I-PER
( O

, O
the O
evacuation O
of O

only O
resulted O

moving O

In O

the O

in O

according O
to O
Krämer B-PER

Ulrich B-PER
Baier I-PER
brought O
figures O
into O
the O
discussion O
: O

In O

there O
are O
about O
600 O

And O
even O
if O

For O
which O
there O
are O
" O
not O
enough O

, O
Baier B-PER
emphasized O
. O

However O
, O
the O
factions O
of O
the O
SPD B-ORG

do O
not O
like O
the O
arguments O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
: O

The O
conditions O
in O
the O

are O
unbearable O
, O
said O
Helgo B-PER
Müller I-PER
( O

. O

This O
necessary O
action O
should O
not O
be O
pushed O
to O

, O
agreed O
Alexander B-PER
Zollmann I-PER
( O

. O

The O
request O
was O
rejected O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
local O
council O
groups O
were O
largely O
unanimous O
on O
the O
tolerance O
zone O
: O

Although O
two O
proposals O
on O
this O
subject O
were O
postponed O
by O
a O
round O
at O
the O
CDU B-ORG

request O
; O
however O
, O
the O
union O
politicians O
were O
also O
not O
principally O
reluctant O
to O
the O
proposals O
of O
the O
other O
groups O
. O

They O
share O
the O
fears O
of O
the O
other O

members O
that O
the O
smaller O
tolerance O
zone O
will O
create O
a O
strong O
expulsion O

on O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O

. O

With O
construction O
plans O
and O
a O
conservation O
statute O
for O
the O
railway B-LOC

, O
the O
SPD B-ORG
wants O
to O
counteract O
the O
negative O
consequences O
of O
the O
new O
blocked O

regulation O
. O

The O
Greens B-ORG
also O
call O
for O
the O
exploitation O
of O
all O
planned O
possibilities O
to O
convert O
the O
former O

, O
which O
are O
now O

“ O

” O
when O

This O

with O

that O
Mr. O

learned O
nothing O

he O

It O

the O

is O
no O

: O

In O

, O
the O

and O
the O
German B-MISC

have O
been O
experiencing O
a O
new O
bloom O
for O
some O
time O

to O

a O

essential O
role O
: O

With O
the O
opening O
up O
of O

Europe I-LOC
and O
the O

, O
the O
German B-MISC

is O
gaining O
weight O
in O
Europe B-LOC
. O

But O
it O
is O
also O
about O
the O
conflict O
with O
the O
Alsacian B-MISC
identity O
. O

After O
all O
, O
this O
region O
was O
a O
constant O
fight O
between O
France O
and O
Germany O
until O
the O
Thirty O
Years O
' O
War O
and O
then O
until O
the O
end O
of O
World O

II I-MISC
- O
a O
history O
with O
a O
well O
- O
grown O
German B-MISC
- I-MISC
French I-MISC
character O
. O

Now O
that O
borders O
are O
increasingly O
losing O
importance O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
new O
possibilities O
are O
emerging O
: O

The O
Alsacean B-MISC
is O
a O
French B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
a O
European B-MISC
with O
its O
own O
regional O
, O
historically O
rooted O
identity O
, O
whose O
cultural O
symbol O
is O
bilingualism O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go O
until O
such O
a O
guideline O
is O
realized O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
at O
the O
moment O
it O
is O
about O
irrevocably O
reversing O
a O
trend O
that O
set O
up O
after O
the O
war O
and O
that O
in O
the O
traditionally O
German O
- O
speaking B-MISC
Alsace B-LOC
made O
German B-MISC
largely O
a O
foreign O
language O
. O

Suppressed O
and O
even O
forbidden O
, O
Alsacian B-MISC
and O
High B-MISC
German I-MISC
were O
not O
used O
as O
their O
written O
form O
of O
expression O
. O

However O
, O
the O
framework O
conditions O
made O
it O
possible O
for O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
and O
German B-MISC
to O
be O
pushed O
back O
more O
and O
more O
. O

So O
many O
towns O
and O
street O
signs O
were O
frenchized B-MISC
. O

Official O
communications O
could O
only O
be O
conducted O
in O
French B-MISC
shortly O
after O
the O
war O
. O

In O
kindergartens O
, O
Elsacian B-MISC
hometown O
songs O
disappeared O
from O
the O
program O
at O
first O
. O

German B-MISC
teaching I-MISC
in O
schools O
has O
been O
reduced O
. O

In O
the O
German B-MISC
- O
language O
editions O
of O
the O
daily O
newspapers O
, O
the O
popular O
sports O
section O
had O
to O
appear O
in O
French B-MISC
. O

There O
were O
and O
still O
exist O
two O
languages O
in O
many O
families O
: O

Parents O
talk O
in O
the O
dialect O
, O
the O
conversations O
with O
the O
children O
take O
place O
in O
French B-MISC
. O

The O
consequence O
: O

French B-MISC
quickly O
developed O
into O
the O
predominant O
language O
of O
communication O
in O
Alsace O
. O

The O
German B-MISC
- O
language O
spending O
of O
the O
regional O
spending O
has O
lost O
and O
is O
still O
losing O
in O
place O
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
younger O
people O
are O
no O
longer O
powerful O
in O
the O
Alsace B-MISC
. O

In O
the O
restaurant O
, O
the O
patron O
is O
able O
to O
help O
German B-MISC
guests O
who O
do O
not O
speak O
French B-MISC
, O
often O
even O
linguistically O
, O
which O
is O
usually O
not O
possible O
for O
the O
young O
waitress O
or O
saleswoman O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
1970s O
, O
EGEurope B-LOC
did O
not O
remain O
ineffective O
- O
German B-MISC
teaching I-MISC
in O
schools O
was O
expanded O
again O
. O

The O
French B-MISC
and O
Badean B-MISC
school O
authorities O
agreed O
on O
a O
program O
to O
promote O
the O
playful O
learning O
of O
the O
" O
language O
of O
the O
neighbor O
" O
already O
in O
elementary O
school O
age O
, O
including O
mutual O
class O
visits O
, O
and O
the O
resonance O
in O
the O
schools O
was O
enormous O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
a O
real O
“ O
bilinguism O
” O
, O
associations O
such O
as O
the O
René O
- O
Schickele B-ORG
Circle I-ORG
, O
which O
is O
strong O
for O
bilingualism O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
- I-LOC
Lothringen I-LOC
, O
had O
to O
feel O
for O
a O
long O
time O
as O
lonely O
callers O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

However O
, O
with O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Wall O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
the O
Iron B-MISC
Curtain I-MISC
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
it O
has O
become O
almost O
fitting O
in O
the O
social O
life O
of O
the O
Alsace B-LOC
to O
advocate O
" O
le O
bilinguisme O
" O
. O

The O
most O
visible O
expression O
of O
this O
development O
: O

In O
more O
and O
more O
places O
, O
the O
French B-MISC
street O
names O
are O
endowed O
with O
Alsatian B-MISC
subtitles O
. O

So O
now O
in O
Mülhausen B-LOC
the O
" O
Rue B-LOC
des I-LOC
Marechaux I-LOC
" O
is O
also O
called O
" O
Schmidgass B-LOC
" O
, O
in O
Colmar B-LOC
the O
" O
Rue B-LOC
des I-LOC
Prêtres I-LOC
" O
is O
covered O
with O
the O
title O
" O
Pfaffegassle B-LOC
" O
, O
which O
sounds O
somewhat O
disrespectful O
to O
German O
ears O
. O

The O
main O
issue O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
language O
teaching O
in O
schools O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
teaching O
of O
German B-MISC
in O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
schools O
is O
further O
intensified O
. O

As O
part O
of O
a O
model O
project O
, O
around O
60 O
classes O
in O
30 O
primary O
schools O
spoke O
German B-MISC
for O
three O
hours O
a O
week O
outside O
the O
usual O
German I-MISC
hours I-MISC
in O
various O
subjects O
. O

A O
spectacular O
success O
has O
been O
achieved O
by O
the O
ABCM B-MISC
Citizens I-MISC
’ O
Initiative O
, O
which O
has O
already O
joined O
about O
800 O
parents O
and O
teachers O
: O

Supported O
by O
subsidies O
from O
the O
Alsacian B-MISC
Regional O
Council O
, O
the O
two O
General O
Councils O
and O
even O
the O
EC B-ORG
, O
also O
with O
practical O
assistance O
from O
some O
municipal O
administrations O
, O
six O
truly O
bilingual O
preschool O
classes O
could O
now O
be O
established O
, O
in O
which O
13 O
hours O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
13 O
hours O
of O
German B-MISC
are O
spoken O
. O

This O
first O
notable O
progress O
towards O
bilingualism O
demonstrates O
that O
the O
advocates O
of O
bilingualism O
still O
face O
a O
stubborn O
opponent O
– O
and O
that O
is O
called O
“ O
Paris B-LOC
” O
. O

In O
Alsace B-LOC
, O
he O
is O
present O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
National O
School O
Authority O
. O

Since O
1982 O
, O
a O
law O
in O
principle O
permits O
equal O
teaching O
in O
French B-MISC
and O
the O
respective O
regional O
language O
if O
parents O
wish O
to O
do O
so O
. O

This O
directive O
was O
implemented O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
in O
Brittany B-LOC
, O
but O
not O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

The O
actual O
concern O
of O
ABCM B-ORG
is O
the O
establishment O
of O
bilingual O
classes O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
official O
state O
school O
system O
. O

The O
city O
council O
of O
Mülhausen B-LOC
has O
already O
made O
a O
similar O
decision O
. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
hearing O
, O
ABCM B-ORG
was O
left O
to O
make O
a O
first O
step O
forward O
with O
bilingual O
kindergartens O
on O
a O
private O
basis O
. O

However O
, O
even O
these O
initiatives O
are O
facing O
resistance O
in O
some O
places O
, O
and O
the O
promised O
subsidies O
from O
the O
EC B-ORG
and O
the O
Alsacian B-MISC
authorities O
can O
not O
be O
fully O
utilized O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
opportunities O
: O

Sometimes O
the O
municipalities O
did O
not O
provide O
spaces O
, O
with O
ABCM B-ORG
assuming O
that O
the O
state O
school O
authority O
occasionally O
also O
exercises O
pressure O
on O
mayors O
. O

In O
the O
most O
spectacular O
dispute O
in O
Pulversheim B-LOC
, O
the O
educators O
of O
the O
state O
school O
, O
with O
the O
back O
cover O
of O
a O
teacher O
association O
, O
resist O
that O
in O
the O
same O
building O
in O
a O
( O
otherwise O
unused O
! O

Room O
was O
housed O
a O
bilingual O
ABCM B-MISC
preschool I-MISC
class I-MISC
. O

The O
city O
council O
and O
the O
school O
administration O
have O
already O
met O
in O
court O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
matter O
is O
not O
yet O
resolved O
. O

After O
all O
: O

" O
State O
" O
and O
" O
private O
" O
children O
can O
now O
use O
the O
same O
toilet O
and O
also O
play O
together O
in O
the O
breaks O
- O
which O
initially O
did O
n't O
go O
. O

Haut B-ORG
Comité I-ORG
– O
President O
Goetschy B-PER
complains O
that O
too O
few O
dialect O
programs O
are O
broadcast O
on O
radio O
and O
television O
. O

Concerned O
, O
the O
politician O
shows O
that O
in O
the O
recent O
reform O
of O
the O
French B-MISC
constitution O
it O
was O
explicitly O
stated O
that O
French B-MISC
is O
the O
" O
language O
of O
the O
republic O
" O
, O
but O
the O
significance O
of O
regional O
languages O
is O
not O
mentioned O
anywhere O
. O

The O
advocates O
of O
bilingualism O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
are O
probably O
not O
wrong O
with O
their O
assumption O
that O
behind O
disinterest O
and O
persistent O
resistance O
in O
“ O
Paris B-LOC
” O
lies O
the O
fear O
of O
a O
sluggish O
“ O
Germanization B-MISC
” O
of O
Alsace B-LOC
, O
a O
“ O
drift O
” O
of O
this O
region O
, O
also O
the O
will O
to O
disclose O
the O
dominance O
of O
the O
French B-MISC
and O
thus O
also O
the O
political O
priority O
of O
centralism O
in O
no O
case O
. O

But O
even O
the O
most O
determined O
supporters O
of O
bilinguism O
clearly O
define O
themselves O
as O
French B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
as O
Europeans B-MISC
and O
Alsaceans B-MISC
, O
who O
want O
to O
preserve O
and O
rebuild O
a O
social O
and O
cultural O
regional O
identity O
in O
the O
growing O
Europe B-LOC
through O
bilingualism O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
not O
only O
in O
“ O
Paris B-LOC
” O
that O
resistance O
must O
be O
overcome O
. O

There O
are O
also O
contradictions O
in O
Elsa B-LOC
itself O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
city B-ORG
administration I-ORG
of O
Strasbourg O
to O
subtitle O
60 O
streets O
and O
squares O
with O
their O
historic O
German B-MISC
names O
, O
just O
in O
the O
city B-MISC
of I-MISC
Europe I-MISC
, O
stumbled O
upon O
unexpectedly O
fierce O
protest O
, O
which O
was O
reflected O
in O
numerous O
readers O
’ O
letters O
of O
rebelled O
Strasbourg B-MISC
citizens O
and O
in O
thoughtful O
comments O
in O
the O
media O
. O

German B-MISC
, O
according O
to O
the O
critics O
, O
was O
not O
only O
the O
language O
of O
the O
Strasbourg B-MISC
student O
Goethe B-PER
, O
but O
also O
the O
language O
of O
Hitler B-PER
. O

It O
became O
apparent O
that O
the O
Nazi B-MISC
period I-MISC
in O
Alsace B-LOC
continued O
as O
a O
trauma O
. O

This O
dispute O
lasted O
for O
months O
until O
a O
compromise O
was O
finally O
found O
: O

The O
signs O
on O
the O
streets O
and O
squares O
are O
not O
given O
German B-MISC
, O
but O
Alsatian B-MISC
additional O
names O
- O
as O
has O
already O
been O
done O
in O
many O
places O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

Ultimately O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
advocates O
of O
bilingualism O
can O
see O
themselves O
in O
the O
unstoppable O
trend O
of O
the O
time O
. O

Only O
the O
practical O
experience O
and O
requirements O
of O
the O
EU B-MISC
Single I-MISC
Market I-MISC
foster O
the O
tendency O
to O
“ O
bilinguism O
” O
. O

After O
all O
, O
about O
60,000 O
Alsatians B-MISC

now O
announced O

the O

The O
area O
between O
Lyon B-LOC
, O
Zurich B-LOC
and O
Savoy B-LOC
is O
now O
truly O
one O
of O
the O
most O
beautiful O
in O
Europe B-LOC
; O
whoever O
can O
afford O
to O
live O
there O
should O
know O
how O
to O
enjoy O
it O
. O

But O
with O
what O
bitterness O
the O
gentlemen O
appear O
in O
the O
covered O
costumes O
, O
how O
sorrowful O
they O
look O
at O
the O
world O
, O
in O
which O
they O
engage O
in O
their O
equally O
lucrative O
and O
trivial O
as O
silently O
as O
ruthlessly O
. O

The O
women O
who O
serve O
in O
this O
male O
world O
only O
as O
accessories O
do O
not O
make O
a O
happier O
impression O
, O
at O
least O
a O
somewhat O
compelled O
appearance O
more O
cheerful O
, O
but O
they O
should O
apparently O
represent O
cheerfulness O
and O
enjoyment O
of O
life O
at O
least O
instead O
. O

And O
the O
police O
officers O
who O
, O
in O
French B-MISC
- O
Swiss O
cooperation O
, O
want O
to O
shine O
behind O
the O
facade O
and O
who O
soon O
get O
to O
the O
neck O
because O
the O
gentlemen O
do O
n’t O
let O
anyone O
with O
glace O
gloves O
come O
into O
their O
way O
: O

The O
lawmakers O
, O
on O
their O

, O
are O
neither O
an O
exhibition O
of O
joy O
in O
life O
nor O
of O
faithfulness O
to O
the O
law O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
they O
throw O
away O
the O
mantle O
of O
moral O
superiority O
for O
their O
quite O
questionable O
actions O

These O

make O
it O
clear O
to O
which O
genre O
Michel B-PER
Deville I-PER
shows O
reverence O
with O
his O
new O

The O

the O

itself O
to O

so O
fragmented O
in O

that O
the O
impression O

arbitrariness O
appears O
far O
more O
than O
that O
of O

It O
is O
a O
brand O
of O
Michel B-PER
Deville I-PER

How O
unevenly O
sophisticated O

exciting O
he O
stages O
“ O
Danger O

” O
, O
brings O
apartments O

creates O

preserves O
a O
mysterious O
aura O

how O
delicately O
he O
covers O
“ O
The O

in O
an O
erotic O
sprinkling O
of O
fiction O

; O
how O
subtly O
he O

But O
now O
" O

, O
a O

On O

to O

that O
could O

. O
” O

For O
him O
, O
a O
youth O
parliament O
does O
not O
exist O
“ O
if O
it O
can O
impose O
nothing O
” O
. O

The O
young O
people O
have O
no O
hope O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
is O
important O
for O
them O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
parliamentary O
life O
. O
” O

Only O
then O
will O
we O
take O
part O
in O
the O
decisions O
, O
” O
says O
Markus B-PER
Schulz I-PER
, O
who O
also O
sits O
in O
the O
coordination O
committee O
. O

Results O
are O
especially O
important O
: O

“ O
We O
have O
to O
show O
something O
. O

Then O
the O
young O
people O
take O
it O
seriously O
and O
continue O
to O
support O
us O
. O
” O

The O
young O
parliamentarians O
realized O
: O

Without O
support O
from O
peers O
, O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
will O
not O
go O
any O
further O
. O
” O

We O
are O
really O
just O
representatives O
. O

We O
can O
only O
pass O
on O
what O
young O
people O
demand O
from O
us O
. O
” O

This O
view O
is O
also O
so O
vehemently O
expressed O
because O
they O
do O
not O
want O
" O
that O
such O
a O
mentality O
arise O
: O

“ O
We O
have O
our O
officials O
and O
they O
are O
already O
doing O
it O
. O
” O

So O
far O
, O
only O
a O
few O
proposals O
have O
reached O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
. O

Maybe O
because O
the O
youths O
had O
to O
first O
enter O
the O
depths O
of O
local O
politics O
themselves O
. O

And O
in O
this O
regard O
, O
even O
her O
once O
greatest O
critic O
, O
FDP B-MISC
group I-MISC
leader I-MISC
Wolfgang B-PER
Hof I-PER
, O
now O
pulls O
the O
hat O
: O

“ O
I O
have O
been O
taught O
a O
better O
one O
, O
” O
says O
Hof B-PER
, O
who O
is O
impressed O
by O
the O
“ O
surprising O
pragmatism O
of O
the O
youth O
. O
” O

Very O
quickly O
they O
would O
have O
seen O
how O
local O
policy O
works O
. O
” O

And O
then O
it O
makes O
sense O
too O
. O

They O
do O
n’t O
just O
mock O
like O
a O
citizens O
’ O
initiative O
that O
does O
something O
. O
” O

He O
who O
assumed O
that O
“ O
this O
is O
going O
to O
die O
” O
now O
hopes O
that O
“ O
this O
is O
going O
to O
continue O
. O
” O

The O
SPD B-MISC
leader I-MISC
Beate B-PER
Fleige I-PER
. O

She O
considers O
it O
crucial O
that O
“ O
young O
people O
now O
also O
articulate O
what O
they O
need O
. O
” O

So O
much O
has O
not O
yet O
come O
, O
” O
says O
CDU B-MISC
group I-MISC
chairman I-MISC
Franz B-PER
Kaunzner I-PER
. O

He O
sees O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
primarily O
as O
an O
exercise O
space O
: O

" O
If O
you O
sometimes O
look O
at O
how O
great O
the O
ignorance O
is O
, O
" O
the O
participation O
in O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
could O
contribute O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
opinion O
among O
young O
people O
. O

What O
he O
calls O
for O
is O
continuity O
: O

“ O
If O
they O
send O
a O
different O
representative O
every O
time O
, O
that O
’s O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
. O
” O

The O
young O
people O
also O
realized O
this O
: O

They O
do O
not O
want O
to O
obey O
the O
principle O
of O
rotation O
. O

They O
will O
also O
grow O
up O
in O
their O
youth O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
their O
term O
of O
office O
is O
one O
year O
. O

What O
happens O
next O
, O
the O
young O
people O
do O
not O
know O
. O

They O
resolutely O
refuse O
to O
regard O
their O
institution O
as O
a O
new O
- O
growing O
forge O
: O

“ O
Nothing O
has O
been O
forged O
here O
yet O
, O
” O
White O
Koehnen B-PER
said O
. O

Those O
who O
want O
to O
engage O
in O
the O
party O
go O
immediately O
into O
their O
youth O
organization O
- O
without O
circumventing O
the O
youth O
parliament O
. O

He O
himself O
is O
far O
from O
thinking O
of O
a O
political O
career O
. O

“ O
I O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
be O
a O
professional O
politician O
. O

This O
is O
someone O
who O
can O

nothing O

As O

according O

the O

considered O
because O
they O
can O
potentially O

only O

has O
now O
put O
the O
suggestion O
into O
the O

The O
justification O
: O

too O
expensive O
. O

Two O

would O
cost O

according O

of O
the O

If O

up O

Günter B-PER

justified O
his O
request O
, O
older O

could O
also O
rest O

The O

also O
be O

The O

in O

effective O

According O

no O

The O

, O
on O
the O

feared O
that O
a O

" O
: O

Traffic O

many O

said O
in O
a O

in O

that O
the O

all O

At O
the O

the O

“ O

This O
applies O
to O
both O
the O
content O

the O
formal O
side O
of O

Indeed O
, O
the O
Westend B-LOC

with O
its O
high O

numerous O
one O

, O
is O
" O
a O
tough O
piece O
" O
even O
for O

This O
also O
applies O
to O
the O

who O
, O
despite O
intensive O

, O
could O
only O
put O
a O

And O
although O
it O
had O
been O

long O
, O
there O
was O
not O
even O
consensus O

After O

Although O

have O
in O

In O

, O
Jürgen B-PER

who O

the O

submitted O
a O

On O
17 O
June O

as O

, O
this O

that O

This O

The O

were O
distributed O
, O
the O

14 O

At O
the O
next O
meeting O
of O
the O
Working O

on O
25 O
July O
, O
a O

was O
not O
taken O
, O
the O

The O

discussed O
on O
August O

. O

The O
result O
: O

They O
are O
not O
complete O
, O
the O

must O
submit O

On O
the O

with O
the O

there O

that O

in O
the O

Jürgen B-PER
Frauenfeld I-PER
has O
now O
spent O
four O
to O
six O
weeks O
drawing O
the O

Subject O
to O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
City O
Working O

, O
another O
three O
to O
four O
months O
must O
be O
expected O
. O

According O
to O
the O
experience O
of O
Klaus B-PER
Janz I-PER
, O
the O
police O
and O
road O
construction O
office O
need O
an O
average O
of O
six O
to O
eight O
weeks O
each O
to O
implement O
the O
plans O
: O

" O
But O
this O
only O
applies O
if O
there O
is O
no O
large O
workload O
, O
such O
as O
at O
trade O
fairs O
. O
" O

For O
Klaus B-PER
Janz I-PER
, O
the O
Southern O
Westend B-LOC
is O
also O
an O
exceptional O
case O
. O

Already O
after O
the O
second O
session O
, O
the O
zones O
are O
usually O
decided O
. O

It O
is O
also O
clear O
to O
him O
: O

“ O
If O
the O
Westend B-LOC
were O
our O
only O
thing O
on O
the O
desk O
, O
it O
could O
go O
faster O
. O
” O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
will O
not O
tire O
of O
stressing O
that O
there O
is O
a O
“ O
basic O
consensus O
” O
with O
the O
planning O
of O
the O
local O
council O
. O

Because O
there O
were O
rumors O
on O
the O
spot O
that O
the O
city O
's O
police O
office O
wanted O
to O
shake O
the O
principles O
of O
the O
new O
traffic O
management O
again O
. O

When O
the O
Tempo-30 O
signs O
are O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
End I-LOC
, O
no O
office O
wants O
to O
speculate O
about O
it O
. O

As O
one O
of O
the O
planners O
said O
: O

“ O
If O
I O
were O
clearer O
, O
I O
would O
make O
my O
money O
elsewhere O

considers O

Because O
with O

, O
the O
cars O
are O
allowed O
to O
drive O
on O
the O
road O
between O
Bokkenheim B-LOC

the O
Westend B-LOC

Also O
in O
the O
district B-ORG

is O
considered O
how O
to O
make O
the O
connection O
of O
the O

safer O
. O

Already O
in O
1991 O
, O
the O

had O
demanded O
a O

to O
reduce O
car O

five O

in O

Now O
, O
the O

have O
made O
a O
new O
move O
: O

Tempo O

on O
the O
Alleenring B-LOC
they O
demanded O
at O
the O
request O

for O
the O

between O
the O

The O
Weather B-PER
: O

“ O
We O
ca O
n’t O
just O
arrange O
speed O
30 O

” O

This O
is O
only O
possible O
if O
" O
the O
local O
situation O
has O
a O
narrow O
road O
" O
. O

But O
here O
, O
as O
transport O
initiatives O
have O
already O
emphasized O
in O
other O
cases O
, O
the O
cat O
bites O
in O
the O
tail O
: O

It O
is O
strained O
because O
the O
road O
is O
wide O
; O
and O
because O
the O
road O
is O
wide O
, O
the O
permitted O
maximum O
speed O
must O
not O
be O
drastically O
reduced O
. O

So O
it O
continues O
to O
roast O

Anton B-PER
Winter I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
had O
already O
suspected O
during O
the O
meeting O
of O
the O
council O
that O
the O
city O
would O
in O
no O
way O
prescribe O
pace O
30 O
on O
the O
solo O
ring B-LOC
- O
and O
thus O
also O
justified O
the O
rejection O
of O
his O
faction O
. O

With O
a O
speed O
reduction O
it O
was O
not O
done O
, O
Winter B-PER
meant O
more O
. O

The O
islands O
should O
be O
expanded O
. O

This O
will O
make O
pedestrians O
safer O
. O

This O
was O
also O
supported O
by O
Günther B-PER
Boege I-PER
. O

However O
, O
the O
SPD B-MISC
group I-MISC
has O
not O
been O
able O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
idea O
so O
far O
. O

A O
reconstruction O
of O
the O
entire O
intersection O
will O
only O
make O
sense O
, O
its O
chairman O
Bernd B-PER
Scherf I-PER
argued O
, O
once O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
subway O
will O
be O
completed O
. O

Previously O
, O
such O
a O
project O
was O
too O
expensive O
. O

Transport O
Planner O
Klaus B-PER
Wetterling I-PER
shares O
this O
view O
. O

It O
was O
only O
six O
years O
ago O
that O
the O
square O
was O
redesigned O
in O
the O
subway O
construction O
. O

Even O
if O
we O
do O
n’t O
need O
every O
trail O
, O
why O
should O
we O
pay O
now O
for O
a O
transformation O
? O

From O
the O
struggle O

and O
our O

passivity O
The O
tireless O
senior O
counselor O
Hildegard B-PER
Baier I-PER
by O
Gabriele B-PER
Fischer I-PER

and O
Hanau B-LOC
. O

Her O
face O
is O
painful O
. O

When O
Hildegard B-PER
Baier I-PER
rises O
from O
the O
couch O
, O
she O
must O
first O
bend O
her O
leg O
straight O
. O

War O
memories O
- O
awakened O
by O
age O
phenomena O
. O

She O
hates O
not O
being O
able O
to O
walk O
anymore O
. O

How O
much O
more O
would O
she O
move O
? O

Ageing O
by O
itself O
does O
not O
affect O
the O
pensioner O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
. O

It O
is O
only O
now O
that O
she O
realizes O
what O
is O
missing O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
social O
pyramid O
. O

That O
’s O
why O
she O
fought O
hard O
to O
get O
what O
she O
wanted O
: O

The O
seniors O
counseling O
. O

Now O
she O
is O
struggling O
to O
keep O
the O
facility O
alive O
. O

Immediately O
after O
her O
retirement O
, O
she O
took O
care O
of O
retirees O
, O
took O
part O
in O
senior O
excursions O
and O
learned O
a O
lot O
about O
the O
lives O
of O
poorer O
older O
people O
. O

The O
Portrait O

She O
repeatedly O
tells O
us O
that O
a O
woman O
could O
not O
even O
afford O
a O
coffee O
because O
she O
was O
at O
the O
barber O
the O
same O
month O
. O

The O
money O
for O
the O
non O
- O
everyday O
was O
wasted O
. O

When O
Hildegard B-PER
Baier I-PER
mentions O
this O
experience O
, O
she O
struggles O
with O
her O
feelings O
: O

“ O
I O
feel O
cold O
on O
my O
back O
. O
” O

No O
wonder O
they O
say O
, O
“ O
I O
want O
to O
know O
for O
whom O
you O
’re O
mad O
. O
” O

You O
have O
enough O
pensions O
. O

As O
long O
as O
she O
worked O
, O
she O
did O
n’t O
even O
care O
about O
life O
after O
her O
60th O
birthday O
. O

Now O
, O
after O
her O
seventy O
, O
she O
can O
remember O
many O
conversations O
with O
social O
centurions O
, O
the O
mayor O
, O
or O
city O
councils O
. O

Most O
often O
she O
bites O
on O
granite O
if O
she O
wanted O
to O
something O
for O
the O
elderly O
: O

The O
establishment O
of O
an O
elderly O
council O
, O
for O
example O
, O
was O
not O
possible O
even O
after O
several O
discussions O
. O

The O
justification O
was O
: O

“ O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
mock O
and O
mock O
like O
the O
foreign O
council O
? O
” O

by O
. O

After O
that O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
more O
to O
do O
. O
” O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Hilde B-PER
Baier I-PER
holds O
on O
to O
her O
senior O
advice O
: O

The O
elderly O
also O
get O
what O
they O
deserve O
. O

The O
fear O
of O
the O
offices O
, O
especially O
before O
the O
social O
service O
, O
should O
be O
taken O
away O
from O
them O
in O
the O
senior O
counseling O
. O
" O

On O
a O
Wednesday O
morning O
of O
the O
month O
, O
Hilde B-PER
Baier I-PER
or O
Herta B-PER
Richter I-PER
await O
their O
“ O
customer O
” O
in O
the O
infothek O
of O
the O
town O
hall O
. O

The O
two O
quiet O
ladies O
submit O
applications O
, O
calculating O
who O
can O
apply O
for O
social O
assistance O
. O

Hilde B-PER
Baier I-PER
legitimizes O
her O
commitment O
to O
counseling O
with O
a O
phrase O
often O
heard O
from O
old O
people O
: O

“ O
The O
boys O
always O
tell O
us O
what O
they O
owe O
us O
. O

Now O
no O
one O
does O
anything O
for O
us O
. O
” O

Hildegard B-PER
Baier I-PER
also O
benefits O
from O
her O
membership O
in O
the O
Hesse B-ORG
Association I-ORG
of O
Seniors O
. O

Once O
a O
year O
, O
delegates O
meet O
to O
discuss O
current O
issues O
with O
professionals O
and O
policymakers O
. O

The O
working O
community O
, O
for O
example O
, O
enacted O
that O
the O
training O
for O
old O
- O
age O
care O
professions O
is O
financed O
. O

Especially O
the O
seniors O
are O
dependent O
on O
combat O
equipment O
such O
as O
Hildegard B-PER
Baier I-PER
. O

She O
does O
not O
take O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
out O
of O
her O
mouth O
. O

If O
she O
wants O
to O
something O
, O
she O
will O
do O
everything O
for O
it O
. O

It O
has O
often O
fought O
against O
windmill O
wings O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
however O
, O
she O
gets O
a O
feeling O
that O
scares O
her O
a O
bit O
: O

of O
indifference O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
she O
was O
not O
afraid O
of O
confrontation O
, O
but O
now O
she O
is O
on O
the O
path O
of O
the O
least O
resistance O
. O

Are O
your O
energy O
supplies O
simply O
consumed O
? O

That O
would O
not O
be O
a O
miracle O
: O

Hilde B-PER
Baier I-PER
is O
one O
of O
the O
notorious O
22s O
. O

When O
the O
Germans B-MISC
started O
World O
War B-MISC
II I-MISC
, O
she O
was O
17 O
. O

After O
the O
war O
, O
she O
, O
like O
most O
, O
had O
to O
start O
all O
over O
again O
. O

Her O
husband O
died O
in O
1969 O
. O

She O
was O
forced O
to O
take O
control O
of O
her O
life O
as O
a O
working O
woman O
and O
mother O
alone O
. O

Two O
years O
ago O
her O
son O
died O
of O
a O
heart O
attack O
. O

A O
shock O
that O
Hildegard B-PER
Baier I-PER
has O
not O
overcome O
to O
this O
day O
. O

Sometimes O
they O
have O
suffered O
from O
depression O
since O
then O
. O

She O
then O
sits O
in O
her O
apartment O
and O
cries O
. O

You O
can O
overcome O
loneliness O
, O
but O
you O
ca O
n’t O
overcome O
loneliness O
, O
” O
she O
says O
in O
a O
shaking O
voice O
. O

These O
are O
the O
moments O
when O
their O
fighting O
nature O
wakes O
up O
again O
. O

Then O
they O
fight O
against O
themselves O
. O
” O

When O
I O
sit O
there O
and O
cry O
my O
eyes O
thick O
, O
I O
ask O
myself O
: O

“ O
What O
does O
this O
bring O
me O
? O
” O

“ O
She O
is O
trying O
to O
raise O
herself O
. O

Usually O
you O
can O
do O
that O
too O
. O

But O
she O
does O
not O
like O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

Probably O
it O
does O
not O
fit O
the O
picture O
she O
has O
of O
herself O
: O

Be O
critical O
and O
do O
n’t O
like O
anything O

Bernd B-PER
Steinmann I-PER
, O
member O
of O

SPD O

Nieder I-ORG
- O
Eschbach O
, O
commented O
on O
the O
planned O
construction O
of O
the O
sport O
hall O
in O
the O
district O
. O

Because O
the O
MGS B-LOC
stands O
out O
for O
the O
Social B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
as O
a O
possible O
location O
. O

SPD B-ORG
and O
the O
Greens B-ORG
from O
the O
district O
are O
now O
proposing O
to O
build O
an O
additional O
hall O
on O
the O
sports O
court O
at O
the O
Otto O
- O
Hahn B-LOC
school I-LOC
, O
which O
the O
sports O
department O
wants O
to O
have O
this O
site O
tested O
. O

But O
one O
thing O
is O
certain O
: O

The O
Dutch B-MISC
will O
have O
to O
be O
patient O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
location O
at O
the O
Michael O
- O
Grzimek B-LOC
school I-LOC
is O
very O
desirable O
for O
elementary O
school O
students O
, O
but O
hardly O
realisable O
. O

The O
existing O
gymnasium O
, O
which O
proved O
too O
small O
years O
ago O
, O
would O
have O
to O
be O
demolished O
. O

This O
would O
have O
resulted O
in O
school O
teaching O
being O
disrupted O
by O
building O
noise O
for O
at O
least O
two O
years O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
no O
sports O
hours O
can O
be O
held O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Sylvia B-PER
Schenk I-PER
, O
a O
school O
and O
sports O
designer O
in O
Frankfurt O
, O
believes O
that O
due O
to O
the O
general O
lack O
of O
gyms O
in O
the O
city O
, O
no O
intact O
hall O
, O
however O
small O
, O
should O
be O
demolished O
. O

Especially O
in O
Nieder B-LOC
- I-LOC
Eschbach I-LOC
, O
where O
only O
two O
sports O
halls O
and O
a O
gym O
are O
available O
, O
such O
an O
action O
would O
exacerbate O
the O
congestion O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
larger O
hall O
on O
the O
site O
of O
the O
Michael O
- O
Grzimek B-LOC
school I-LOC
would O
shrink O
the O
pausenhof B-LOC
. O

The O
district O
sports O
facility O
also O
stands O
out O
as O
the O
location O
of O
the O
new O
hall O
. O

Students O
of O
the O
MGS B-LOC
, O
who O
do O
n’t O
all O
find O
their O
place O
in O
the O
school O
’s O
own O
gym O
, O
would O
take O
a O
quarter O
- O
hour O
walk O
to O
get O
there O
. O

With O
a O
lesson O
of O
only O
45 O
minutes O
, O
this O
would O
not O
be O
acceptable O
. O

The O
only O
possibility O
remains O
to O
build O
the O
new O
hall O
on O
the O
sporting O
field O
of O
the O
Otto O
- O
Hahn B-LOC
school I-LOC
. O

Since O
the O
outdoor O
sports O
facility O
is O
polluted O
with O
dioxins O
and O
students O
have O
been O
using O
the O
district O
sports O
field O
for O
some O
time O
, O
the O
OHS B-LOC
, O
which O
has O
its O
own O
hall O
, O
would O
not O
have O
any O
additional O
disadvantage O
. O

For O
the O
students O
of O
the O
Michael O
- O
Grzimek B-LOC
school I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
about O
200 O
meters O
away O
, O
this O
location O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
reach O
. O

Here O
, O
too O
, O
the O
new O

could O
be O
so O
generously O
designed O
that O
the O
TuS B-ORG

which O
has O
so O
far O
pushed O

would O

a O

After O

a O

far O

It O
is O

here O
that O
the O
CDU O

CSU B-MISC
group I-MISC
and O
the O
CDU B-MISC
family I-MISC
minister I-MISC
, O
Ms. O
H. B-PER

do O

take O
any O

they O
could O
expect O

Thus O
, O

are O
punished O
by O

for O
the O

In O

The O

in O

solely O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
1993 O
a O

can O
be O
found O
in O

According O
to O
Inge B-PER

of O

there O

Also O
in O
June O
1991 O
, O
the O
city O
had O
announced O
, O
together O
with O
the O

Therefore O
, O
there O
was O
no O

explaining O
why O

Weiser O
also O
responds O
to O
the O
argument O
of O
the O
First O
City O
Council O
Klaus B-PER
Minkel I-PER
that O
Paragraph O

of O
the O
Federal O

allows O

The O
argument O
calls O
Wiser O
" O
myopia O
coupled O
with O

" O
. O

For O
the O
SPD B-ORG
, O
which O
ruled O
with O
an O
absolute O
majority O
after O
the O

, O
and O
the O
CDU B-ORG
, O
which O
then O
ruled O
with O
an O
equally O
absolute O
majority O
for O
14 O
years O
, O
had O
, O
according O
to O
Weiser O
, O
enough O
time O
to O
" O
consistently O
" O
enforce O
Paragraph O
34 O
. O

When O
you O
look O
at O
the O
city O
centre O
, O
you O
can O
see O
: O

Paragraph O
34 O
does O
not O
protect O
that O
much O
. O

Weiser B-PER
also O
pointed O
out O
the O
wild O
growth O
of O
advertising O
plants O
in O
this O
context O
. O

According O
to O
jurisprudence O
, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
cut O
by O
paragraph O
34 O
, O
but O
only O
by O
a O
draft O
statute O
. O

But O
above O
all O
, O
the O
coordination O
of O
the O
construction O
projects O
favoured O
by O
the O
CDU B-ORG
with O
the O
builders O
only O
disguises O
the O
harsh O
reality O
, O
since O
the O
agreed O
design O
statute O
explicitly O
provides O
for O
their O
extension O
if O
necessary O
. O
” O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
now O
possible O
for O
the O
administration O
to O
prevent O
its O
unapproved O
construction O
project O
by O
threatening O
to O
extend O
the O
design O
charter O
, O
” O
says O
Weiser B-PER
. O

The O
consequence O
: O

“ O
The O
builders O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
the O
city O
wants O
. O

Suddenly O
they O
are O
threatened O
. O
” O

This O
will O
not O
happen O
if O
there O
is O
a O
comprehensive O
statute O
on O
which O
everyone O
can O
orient O
themselves O
. O

This O
creates O
legal O
certainty O
and O
clarity O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
so O

Such O
a O
hearing O
was O
held O
in O
March O
1983 O
, O
at O
the O
time O
still O
under O
the O
former O
CDU B-MISC
magistrate I-MISC
. O

According O
to O
law O
, O
the O
buyer O
is O
only O
obliged O
to O
have O
a O
hearing O
. O

Wolfgang B-PER
Hescher I-PER
, O
however O
, O
is O
convinced O
that O
a O
new O
meeting O
is O
necessary O
because O
since O
the O
change O
of O
government O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
" O
the O
basic O
lines O
of O
planning O
have O
changed O
greatly O
" O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
townsmen O
want O
to O
build O
more O
than O
twice O
as O
many O
houses O
as O
their O
predecessors O
- O
about O
5,000 O
people O
will O
live O
in O
the O
73 O
- O

hill O
at O
one O
time O
. O

The O
“ O
compressed O
construction O
, O
” O
Hescher B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
is O
, O
however O
, O
only O
possible O
if O
a O
rail O
- O
bound O
vehicle O
will O
drive O
into O
the O
area O
. O
” O

However O
, O
the O
possible O
route O
is O
still O
being O
discussed O
. O

For O
the O
Conservatives O
it O
is O
clear O
: O

The O
" O
many O
differences O
" O
can O
only O
be O
clarified O
in O
a O
public O
hearing O
. O

Social B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
see O
this O
differently O
. O

“ O
We O
want O
an O
extraordinary O
meeting O
of O
the O
local O
council O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
” O
said O
Fraktions O
leader O
Günther B-PER
Häfner I-PER
. O

This O
will O
be O
sufficient O
to O
make O
the O
planning O
" O
more O
transparent O
to O
the O
citizens O
" O
. O

A O
hearing O
under O
paragraph O
3 O
will O
, O
on O
the O

hand O
, O
lead O
to O
another O
" O
one O

" O
, O
fears O
Jörg B-PER
Stelzer I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
, O
" O
because O
then O
we O
go O
back O
from O
the O
draft O
phase O
to O
the O
preliminary O
draft O
phase O
. O
" O

The O
2,500 O
houses O
in O
the O
Preungesheimer O
Beuge O
would O
therefore O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

The O
real O
reason O
for O
the O
CDU B-MISC
petition I-MISC
is O
a O
completely O
different O
, O
suspicious O
SPD B-MISC
chief I-MISC
Häfner B-PER
: O

" O
Like O
everywhere O
, O
" O
the O
Christian B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
wanted O
to O
prevent O
housing O
construction O
in O
the O
area O
, O
" O
and O
to O
do O
so O
they O
have O
every O
means O
right O
. O
" O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
has O
been O
conservative O
district O
politicians O
who O
have O
repeatedly O
aroused O
fear O
of O
the O
“ O
modern O
slums O
” O
over O
the O
past O
few O
months O
. O

Local O
Councillor O
Robert B-PER
Lange I-PER
even O
stumbled O
upon O
the O
statement O
: O

“ O
I O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
live O
there O
. O
” O

“ O
We O
are O
not O
against O
building O
, O
” O
Hescher B-PER
cried O
out O
. O

A O
“ O
specific O
compression O
” O
he O
could O
only O
imagine O
in O
a O
“ O
wrapped O
” O
form O
– O
in O
other O
words O
: O

2500 O
houses O
are O
too O
many O
. O

And O
on O
this O
number O
the O
Christian B-MISC
Democrat I-MISC
wants O
to O
shake O
in O
the O
public O
hearing O
. O

That O
its O
proposal O
could O
eventually O
be O
adopted O
, O
the O
CDU B-ORG
owes O
to O
the O
unusual O
voting O
behavior O
of O
the O
coalition O
: O

While O
the O
Social O
Democrat O
Renate B-PER
Münch I-PER
abstained O
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
Christoph B-PER
Zielonka I-PER
agreed O

Because O

this O

this O

The O
start O

Peter B-PER
Blaschke I-PER

chairman O
of O
the O

" O
, O
regrets O
that O
German B-LOC
hobby O
singers O
still O
have O
to O
struggle O
with O
this O
chapter O
of O
German B-MISC
history O
. O

Often O
enough O
, O
he O
has O
also O
realized O
, O
but O
they O
also O
contribute O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
doubts O
of O
some O
fellow O
citizens O
about O
German B-MISC
songwriting O
remain O
. O

There O
is O
something O
else O
with O
the O
big O
voters O
in O
the O
clinch O
: O

with O
the O
image O
of O
the O
singing O
association O
, O
whose O
work O
is O
exhausted O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
Baß O
and O
Bariton O
try O
to O
stay O
firm O
on O
the O
truss O
. O

In O
the O
face O
of O
this O
misery O
only O
helps O
a O
concerted O
action O
, O
the O
singers O
thought O
, O
and O
joined O
in O
1981 O
to O
the O
" O
Singing B-ORG
Circle I-ORG
Hochtaunus I-ORG
" O
, O
which O
unites O
a O
total O
of O
53 O
clubs O
. O

The O
approximately O
2000 O
members O
in O
around O
80 O
choirs O
give O
corresponding O
emphasis O
to O
the O
plans O
of O
the O
singer O
circle O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
struggle O
against O
the O
negative O
image O
is O
far O
from O
over O
. O

Claus O
- O
Peter B-PER
Blaschke I-PER
has O
discovered O
“ O
self O
- O
criticism O
and O
openness O
” O
as O
miracle O
weapons O
. O

Circle O
leader O
Mark B-PER
Osepkin I-PER
can O
quite O
imagine O
that O
the O
term O
" O
German B-MISC
song O
" O
will O
eventually O
disappear O
from O
the O
statutes O
of O
the O
singing O
associations O
. O

Since O
the O
singing O
clubs O
also O
and O
above O
all O
want O
to O
reach O
the O
offspring O
, O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
“ O
only O
” O
to O
sing O
Tharau B-PER
’s I-PER
anks I-PER
, O
but O
with O
pieces O
of O
musicals O
and O
modern O
music O
to O
also O
inspire O
the O
youth O
for O
choreography O
. O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
singers O
see O
themselves O
as O
victims O
of O
the O
dilemma O
that O
a O
composer O
composes O
only O
if O
he O
knows O
that O
this O
work O
is O
purchased O
from O
him O
. O

And O
this O
, O
according O
to O
Claus O
- O
Peter B-PER
Blaschke I-PER
, O
is O
still O
not O
obvious O
in O
modern O
music O
. O

The O
trend O
of O
many O
choirs O
is O
still O
going O
to O
sing O
( O
and O
buy O
) O
what O
you O
know O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
the O
clubs O
have O
little O
literature O
that O
is O
appealing O
to O
young O
people O
, O
explains O
Blaschke B-PER
, O
and O
comes O
into O
the O
chord O
editions O
of O
the O
Beatles B-MISC
song I-MISC
" O
Let O
it O
be O
" O
. O

New O
compositions O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
also O
allowed O
for O
a O
stronger O
confrontation O
with O
the O
present O
time O
. O
” O

When O
I O
see O
our O
natural O
misery O
, O
then O
I O
can O
sing O
, O
Oh O
, O
You O
beautiful O
forest O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
thing O
has O
a O
meaning O
. O

But O
a O
contemporary O
composer O
could O
also O
write O
a O
work O
about O
the O
death O
of O
the O
forest O
. O

But O
only O
if O
he O
can O
sell O
it O
. O
” O

Only O
if O
a O
solution O
is O
found O
, O
if O
the O
clubs O
open O
up O
to O
the O
youth O
and O
take O
care O
of O
them O
, O
can O
the O
choir O
singer O
have O
a O
future O
in O
his O
opinion O
. O

For O
some O
choirs O
in O
the O
circle O
, O
he O
also O
predicts O
their O
extinction O
. O

Other O
choirs O
, O
such O
as O
the O
international O
children O
's O
choir O
from O
Oberursel B-LOC
or O
the O
" O
Tyre B-ORG
Town I-ORG
Spatzen I-ORG
" O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
let O
him O
look O
hopefully O
into O
the O
future O
. O

Especially O
because O
singing O
for O
him O
, O
beyond O
the O
purely O
musical O
, O
also O
promotes O
the O
sense O
of O
community O
. O

In O
our O
society O
, O
the O
association O
represents O
in O
his O
eyes O
a O
cell O
of O
personal O
contacts O
: O

The O
group O
dynamic O
aspect O
as O
an O
“ O
important O
by O
- O
product O
” O
of O
singing O
. O

However O
, O
he O
also O
finds O
that O
" O
singing O
liberates O
" O
and O
most O
hobby O
singers O
" O
just O
have O
fun O
" O
. O

Even O
more O
fun O
it O
should O
make O
them O
produce O
" O
quality O
" O
, O
so O
his O
conviction O
. O

The O
openness O
that O
he O
demands O
must O
also O
mean O
courage O
for O
new O
, O
difficult O
and O
unknown O
pieces O
. O

However O
, O
that O
makes O
the O
spectrum O
of O
choirs O
clear O
is O
different O
from O
association O
to O
association O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
the O
Singing B-ORG
Circle I-ORG
of O
Hochtaunus O
does O
not O
close O
to O
new O
members O
: O

Recently O
, O
the O
choir O
“ O
Enraget B-ORG
euch I-ORG
” O
from O
Friedrichsdorf B-LOC
was O
added O
. O

The O
political O
orientation O
does O
not O
frighten O
the O
unification O
of O
choirs O
, O
as O
Blaschke B-PER
emphasizes O
. O
” O

We O
do O
n’t O
ask O
if O
there O
is O
a O
political O
background O
there O
. O
” O

However O
, O
the O
choirs O
can O
not O
shut O
themselves O
down O
because O
the O
singers O
continue O
a O
tradition O
that O
began O
in O
the O
19th O
century O
. O

The O
young O
people O
protested O
with O
their O
songs O
. O

Many O
working O
choirs O
were O
formed O
until O
the O
Second B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
, O
after O
which O
the O
chant O
was O
then O
assigned O
to O
the O
choir O
. O

Even O
today O
, O
the O
choirs O
feel O
this O
hole O
in O
their O
history O
; O
the O
“ O
middle O
- O
age O
generation O
” O
is O
only O
weakly O
represented O
in O
the O
clubs O
. O

A O
means O
in O
the O
fight O
against O
the O
decline O
of O
members O
are O
also O
to O
be O

, O
with O
which O
the O
singer O
circle O
now O
wants O
to O
introduce O
itself O
to O
a O
wider O
public O
. O

Because O

about O

“ O
We O
are O
worried O
about O

” O
local O

said O

Thus O
, O
the O
local O

called O
on O
the O

to O
terminate O
the O

as O

The O

Given O
the O
health O

that O

arise O

it O
is O
incomprehensible O
that O

( O
Fechenheim B-LOC

wants O
to O
use O
. O

At O
the O
station O
" O
Mainkur B-LOC
" O
in O
Fechenheim B-LOC
, O
the O
buses O
depart O
at O
late O
evening O
just O
a O
few O
minutes O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
S O
- O
Bahn O
. O

Those O
who O
want O
to O
take O
the O
bus O
from O
there O
must O
consider O
longer O
waiting O
times O
. O

At O
the O
recent O
meeting O
of O
the O
local B-LOC
council I-LOC
, O
the O
SPD B-MISC
group I-MISC
submitted O
a O
motion O
calling O
for O
the O
buses O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
run O
in O
the O
late O
traffic O
a O
few O
minutes O
after O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
S O
- O
Bahn O
. O

In O
the O
justification O
of O
the O
request O
, O
the O
Group O
welcomed O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
FVV B-ORG
has O
reduced O
the O
sequence O
of O
the O
S O
7 O
working O
days O
to O
30 O
minutes O
. O

This O
significantly O
reduces O
the O
travel O
time O
from O
the O
main O
and O
southern B-LOC
railway I-LOC
station I-LOC
to O
Fechenheim B-LOC
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
time O
gained O
at O
Mainkur B-LOC
railway O
station O
is O
lost O
again O
, O
as O
passengers O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
" O
44er O
" O
there O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
proposal O
was O
unanimously O
adopted O
by O
the O
city O
councils O
. O

Not O
so O
unanimous O
was O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
local O
council O
for O
a O
second O
SPD B-MISC
advance I-MISC
. O

In O
the O
first O
part O
of O
the O
proposal O
, O
the O
Social B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
called O
for O
the O
buses O
of O
line O
44 O
to O
run O
every O
10 O
a.m. O
, O
until O
20 O
a.m. O
every O
20 O
minutes O
and O
then O
every O
half O
an O
hour O
in O
the O
main O
traffic O
hours O
. O

In O
order O
to O
ensure O
that O
as O
many O
seats O
as O
possible O
are O
occupied O
with O
passengers O
at O
a O
denser O
rate O
, O
smaller O
buses O
should O
be O
used O
. O

The O
local O
council O
approved O
the O
motion O
against O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
CDU B-MISC
group I-MISC
. O

As O
its O
chairman O
Dieter B-PER
Kunzler I-PER
said O
, O
the O
44er O
is O
still O
a O
" O
ghost O
bus O
" O
that O
is O
hardly O
used O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
evening O
hours O
. O

He O
described O
it O
as O
" O
not O
meaningful O
" O
to O
have O
the O
bus O
roll O
even O
more O
frequently O
" O
through O
the O
narrow O
streets O
of O
Fechenheim B-LOC
" O
. O

This O
is O
not O
an O
argument O
against O
a O
shorter O
timeframe O
, O
said O
Albrecht B-PER
Reinhard I-PER
( O
FDP B-ORG
) O
. O

Just O
because O
the O
bus O
runs O
so O
rarely O
, O
it O
is O
not O
an O
inexpensive O
means O
of O
transport O
and O
is O
therefore O
little O
used O
. O

This O
will O
change O
if O
the O
44s O
runs O
more O
frequently O
, O
the O
Liberal O
Democrat O
speculated O
. O

This O
has O
been O
confirmed O
, O
according O
to O
a O
magistrates O
report O
, O
everywhere O
where O
the O
bus O
is O
well O
accessible O
by O
subway O
, O
says O
Reinhard B-PER
. O

The O
second O
part O
of O
the O
SPD B-MISC
request I-MISC
requested O
that O
the O
bus O
's O
departure O
times O
at O
the O
Gwinnerstraße B-LOC
stop O
in O
the O
Borsigallee B-LOC
be O
coupled O
with O
the O
subway O
line O
7 O
. O

Instead O
of O
every O
third O
FVV B-MISC
customers I-MISC
are O
expected O
to O
move O
from O
every O
second O
subway O
without O
long O
waiting O
in O
the O
44s O
. O

All O
groups O
in O
the O
council O
agreed O
to O
the O
request O

called O
a O
Fechenheim B-MISC
parental O
initiative O
her O
play O
week O
, O
which O
she O
had O
organized O
together O
with O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Children O

Office O
on O
the O
" O
Castle B-LOC
Loan I-LOC
" O
- O
known O
in O
the O
district O
as O
" O
Linneplatz B-LOC
" O
. O

Objective O
of O
the O
action O
: O

The O
adults O
wanted O
to O
show O
that O
their O
older O
grandchildren O
lacked O
equipment O
to O
play O
on O
the O
playground O
. O

The O
place O
was O
established O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Yet O
another O
lack O
: O

The O
square O
is O
often O
occupied O
by O
cars O
that O
have O
nothing O
to O
look O
for O
there O
. O

For O
the O
" O
Castle O
Loan O
" O
, O
a O
large O
square O
paved O
square O
in O
the O
Fechenheimer B-MISC
town O
centre O
, O
is O
a O
pedestrian O
area O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
only O
a O
few O
residents O
with O
the O
corresponding O
passports O
are O
likely O
to O
drive O
over O
the O
" O
Linneplatz B-LOC
" O
, O
between O
5 O
a.m. O
and O
11 O
a.m. O
suppliers O
are O
also O
allowed O
. O

Initially O
, O
the O
parents O
therefore O
wanted O
to O
block O
the O
Starkenburger B-LOC
Street I-LOC
during O
the O
game O
week O
, O
from O
which O
it O
can O
be O
reached O
from O
the O
square O
. O

However O
, O
since O
the O
action O
was O
supported O
by O
two O
honorary O
forces O
, O
the O
initiative O
had O
to O
abandon O
this O
project O
again O
. O

Because O
employees O
of O
an O
authority O
are O
expressly O
prohibited O
from O
participating O
in O
such O
- O
soberly O
considered O
- O
illegal O
acts O
. O

However O
, O
the O
help O
of O
the O
two O
educators O
and O
the O
toy O
equipment O
of O
the O
children O
's O
office O
the O
parents O
did O
not O
want O
to O
give O
up O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
game O
week O
went O
well O
even O
without O
street O
blockade O
, O
said O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
, O
a O
mother O
of O
five O
children O
. O

In O
the O
first O
two O
days O
, O
about O
30 O
children O
had O
been O
there O
, O
painted O
and O
buried O
in O
the O
self O
- O
built O
plank O
pool O
. O

Everything O
that O
moves O
in O
the O
air O
and O
what O
is O
on O
the O
earth O
, O
" O
the O
little O
ones O
drew O
on O
two O
sun O
seals O
that O
still O
need O
to O
be O
sewn O
together O
. O

Also O
a O
wall O
of O
the O
playground O
is O
still O
being O
painted O
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
of O
the O
play O
week O
, O
the O
rain O
temporarily O
stopped O
the O
fun O
around O
the O
" O
Line B-LOC
Playground I-LOC
" O
. O

Already O
about O
three O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
competent O
local O
council O
decided O
to O
block O
the O
" O
castle B-LOC
loan I-LOC
" O
for O
transit O
traffic O
and O
set O
up O
a O
children O
's O
playground O
there O
. O

Last O
year O
, O
a O
small O
playground O
was O
laid O
in O
a O
corner O
in O
the O
front O
area O
of O
the O
square O
on O
Starkenburger B-LOC
Straße I-LOC
. O

A O
little O
sand O
, O
a O
few O
toy O
machines O
- O
for O
boys O
and O
girls O
who O
are O
no O
longer O
in O
childhood O
, O
the O
offer O
is O
a O
bit O
scarce O
. O

This O
will O
improve O
in O
the O
future O
: O

The O
City O
Youth O
Office O
wants O
to O
equip O
the O
“ O
Lines B-LOC
Playground I-LOC
” O
with O
balls O
, O
tires O
, O
stalls O
and O
other O
play O
equipment O
. O

The O
toys O
should O
be O
placed O
in O
a O
lockable O
box O
and O
some O
keys O
should O
be O
distributed O
to O
the O
parents O
. O

On O
the O
wooden O
playhouse O
that O
the O
children O
wanted O
, O
the O
little O
ones O
will O
have O
to O
give O
up O
. O

The O
construction O
of O
such O
a O
cottage O
is O
too O
expensive O
and O
also O
associated O
with O
numerous O
safety O
requirements O
, O
explained O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
. O

Replacement O
offered O
during O
the O
play O
week O
a O
wooden O
climbing O
frame O
of O
the O
children O
's O
office O
. O

A O
major O
disadvantage O
of O
the O
playground O
remains O
: O

It O
is O
simply O
too O
small O
to O
accommodate O
all O
the O
children O
who O
want O
to O
play O
there O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
offspring O
has O
already O
taken O
possession O
of O
part O
of O
the O
linen B-LOC
space I-LOC
. O

Children O
do O
not O
play O
uninterrupted O
. O

Because O
as O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
, O
cars O
and O
trucks O
are O
constantly O
driving O
unlawfully O
through O
the O
pedestrian O
zone O
, O
and O
sometimes O
" O
the O
whole O
place O
is O
parked O
" O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
the O
parents O
, O
through O
the O
local O
council O
, O
sought O
to O
effectively O
ban O
illegal O
traffic O
from O
the O
borrowing O
of O
the O
castle O
. O

Their O
efforts O
have O
so O
far O
been O
unsuccessful O
despite O
the O
magistrate O
’s O
promises O
. O

Proposal O
from O
the O
officers O
of O
the O
competent O
police O
department O
: O

In O
the O
future O
, O
parents O
should O
note O
the O
identification O
marks O
of O
all O
cars O
that O
pass O
the O
square O
anyway O
, O
and O
indicate O
their O
drivers O
. O
” O

We O
do O
n’t O
want O

, O
who O

His O

had O
already O
initiated O
a O
standard O

procedure O
for O

about O
two O
years O
ago O
. O

However O
, O
the O
dispute O
over O
the O
construction O
area O
in O
preferred O
sloping O
position O
continues O
. O

A O
first O
plan O
of O
1983 O
had O
the O
magistrate O
then O
withdrawn O
. O

The O
SPD B-MISC
- I-MISC
led I-MISC
state O
government O
had O
complained O
of O
legal O
and O
formal O
errors O
in O
the O
draft O

. O

Basically O
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
and O
the O
SPD B-ORG
refused O
to O
open O
the O
land O
for O
a O
few O
“ O
luxury O

They O
wanted O
to O

When O
the O
CDU B-ORG
then O
also O
ruled O
in O
Wiesbaden B-LOC
, O
the O
magistrate O
presented O
a O
second O
plan O
, O
which O
hardly O
differed O
from O
the O
first O
. O

In O
1988 O
, O
before O
the O
country O
elections O
and O
the O
subsequent O
change O
of O
government O
, O
the O
Hesse B-MISC

blessed O
the O
construction O

. O

The O
fact O
that O
there O
is O
not O
yet O
built O
there O
is O
due O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
to O
the O
expensive O
relocation O
process O
for O
the O
area O
: O

The O
" O
stone B-LOC
" O
consists O
of O
many O
small O
parcels O
that O
run O
as O
narrow O
strips O
in O
the O
north O
- O
south O
direction O
. O

An O
exception O
here O
is O
the O
mentioned O
about O
1060 O
square O
meters O
of O
land O
in O
the O
west O
of O
the O
area O
, O
on O
which O
there O
is O
already O
a O
concrete O
foundation O
. O

The O
owners O
, O
therefore O
, O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
relocation O
, O
but O
could O
start O
the O
construction O
now O
. O

At O
the O
very O
beginning O
, O
the O
workers O
were O
stirring O
up O
powerful O
dust O
there O
, O
which O
was O
why O
Klaus B-PER
Boller I-PER
was O
able O
to O
a O
construction O
stop O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
July O
, O
he O
had O
filed O
an O
objection O
to O
the O
building O
permit O
after O
seeing O
it O
a O
few O
days O
earlier O
. O

The O
tax O
expert O
, O
who O
had O
resisted O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
savage O
dispersed O
fruit O
farm O
from O
the O
beginning O
, O
had O
noticed O
several O
so O
- O
called O
exemptions O
from O
the O
original O
plan O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
requirement O
not O
to O
build O
row O
houses O
, O
the O
builders O
on O
the O
plot O
in O
question O
may O
also O
deviate O
from O
the O
prescribed O
base O
area O
number O
( O
GRZ O
) O
and O
floor O
area O
number O
( O
GFZ O
) O
. O

These O
values O
indicate O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
built O
ground O
area O
and O
the O
area O
of O
all O
the O
rooms O
of O
a O
house O
to O
the O
square O
meter O
of O
the O
entire O
building O
ground O
. O

The O
number O
of O
permitted O
ground O
and O
floor O
areas O
was O
increased O
in O
the O
building O
permit O
by O
40 O
and O
44 O
percent O
, O
respectively O
, O
compared O
with O
the O
specifications O
of O
B380 O
. O

This O
means O
, O
in O
simpler O
terms O
, O
that O
a O
larger O
part O
of O
the O
plot O
is O
built O
than O
originally O
planned O
. O

With O
his O
fear O
that O
with O
these O
liberations O
the O

Also O
, O
some O
of O

, O
only O
one O

due O

The O

Further O
it O
says O
: O

“ O
Whoever O
listens O

to O
what O
the O
German B-MISC

at O

outstanding O
satisfaction O
of O

Greens B-ORG
about O
the O
growing O
weakness O
of O
the O

. O
” O

In O
principle O
, O
Kleinert B-PER
believes O
that O
Western O
party O
democracies O
have O
produced O
an O
increasingly O
differentiated O
, O
highly O
complex O
set O
of O
institutions O
. O

In O
it O
, O
in O
the O
sum O
of O
actions O
, O
a O
multitude O
of O
different O
actors O
produce O
a O
growing O
immobility O
of O
the O
whole O
system O
. O
” O

It O
could O
be O
buried O
: O

An O
increasing O
number O
of O
stakeholders O
is O
producing O
more O
and O
more O
noise O
at O
the O
most O
diverse O
levels O
of O
policy O
, O
administration O
and O
jurisdiction O
. O

It O
is O
achieved O
in O
the O
case O
by O
the O
growing O
volume O
relatively O
little O
. O

Because O
this O
is O
the O
case O
, O
politics O
is O
increasingly O
escaping O
into O
symbolic O
acts O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
contradicts O
the O
legalities O
of O
media O
democracy O
. O

In O
the O
place O
of O
action O
comes O
the O
demonstration O
of O
thoughtfulness O
, O
the O
assurance O
that O
the O
problem O
will O
be O
taken O
seriously O
, O
etc O
. O
” O

Kleinert B-PER
also O
sees O
in O
the O
development O
he O
outlines O
a O
reverse O
side O
of O
the O
democratisation O
push O
, O
which O
has O
produced O
a O
considerable O
gain O
in O
freedom O
of O
decision O
for O
the O
individual O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
years O
. O

Politics O
finds O
it O
harder O
to O
legitimize O
itself O
, O
the O
willingness O
to O
unquestionably O
accept O
decisions O
of O
higher O
authorities O
decreases O
. O

The O
sense O
of O
“ O
formalized O
social O
relations O
” O
, O
i.e. O
parties O
, O
trade O
unions O
or O
associations O
, O
also O
decreases O
. O

According O
to O
Kleinert B-PER
, O
the O
shaping O
weakness O
of O
politics O
is O
also O
the O
price O
that O
Western O
societies O
would O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
their O
high O
degree O
of O
pluralism O
of O
interests O
, O
opinions O
and O
lifestyles O
. O

It O
is O
fundamentally O
questionable O
whether O
, O
under O
the O
difficult O
conditions O
of O
the O
1990s O
, O
the O
level O
of O
democratization O
of O
the O
1980s O
can O
beined O
. O
” O

There O
’s O
also O
a O
shortage O
of O
personalities O
who O
impressed O
themselves O
, O
too O
many O
politicians O
seemed O
interchangeable O
, O
“ O
a O
little O
like O
politicians O
from O
the O
rod O
, O
” O
Kleinert B-PER
writes O
. O

However O
, O
they O
should O
also O
be O
a O
reflection O
of O
society O
, O
for O
such O
lawsuits O
would O
also O
exist O
in O
other O
professions O
, O
in O
sport O
, O
in O
art O
and O
in O
business O
. O
” O

Certainly O
, O
" O
Kleinert B-PER
said O
, O
" O
the O
leadership O
capacity O
of O
the O
political O
staff O
has O
decreased O
while O
the O
vanity O
of O
the O
individual O
actors O
has O
increased O
. O
" O

With O
an O
increasing O
tendency O
, O
politicians O
tended O
to O
take O
their O
judgments O
about O
themselves O
and O
their O
political O
performance O
solely O
from O
their O
mirror O
image O
in O
the O

. O

What O
is O
necessary O
for O
quick O

and O
spectacles O
, O
which O
sometimes O
makes O
some O
twists O
, O
but O
then O
often O
quickly O
forgotten O
again O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
libertarian O
spirit O
of O

comes O
with O

even O
referred O
to O
himself O
as O
his O
" O

- O
and O
now O
also O
the O

Some O
people O
prefer O
the O
human O

Kassel B-LOC
than O
the O
monumental O

But O
: O

These O
too O
can O
not O
be O
overlooked O

Unlike O
some O
of O
the O
artist O

colleagues O
with O
less O
fortune O

The O
Berliner B-MISC
sculptor O
Hubertus B-PER

Goltz I-PER
has O
now O
filed O
and O
Borofsky B-PER
has O
assumed O
a O
plagiarism O
. O

In O
the O
eighties O
, O
he O
had O
himself O
balanced O
a O
male O
art O
figure O
over O
a O
rod O
that O
ran O
from O
a O
high O
house O
at O
an O
airy O
height O

It O
is O
unlikely O
that O
Borofsky B-PER
copied O
it O
. O

Or O
did O
he O
even O
spy O
on O
the O
works O
of O
the O
Frankfurter B-MISC
artist O
Nikolaus B-PER
Kessler I-PER
? O

In O
1987 O
, O
he O
created O
a O
slide O
drawing O
called O
" O
Flight B-MISC

, O
which O
also O
depicts O
a O

moving O

Coincidence O
or O
magic O
? O

The O
action O
could O
be O
imitated O
by O
a O
fashionable O

but O
iconographically O
it O
could O
also O
be O

of O

The O

of O

of O

The O

An O
excerpt O
of O
about O
120 O
images O
now O
shows O
, O
after O
the O
large O
exhibition O
at O
the O
Ludwig B-LOC
Museum O
in O
Cologne O
, O
the O
Photography O
Forum O
Frankfurt B-LOC
. O

The O
greatest O
possible O
stylistic O
diversity O
determined O
the O
selection O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
a O
historical O
overview O
of O
the O
act O
photography O
is O
given O
. O

In O
ever O
- O
new O
irritation O
bags O
, O
the O
models O
are O
draped O
in O
front O
of O
the O
phallic O
beam O
of O
the O
camera O
. O

In O
the O
1920s O
, O
they O
were O
thrown O
on O
the O
coastal O
rocks O
, O
using O
the O
fertility O
symbol O
of O
the O
burning O
sea O
as O
a O
cover O
. O

To O
a O
aesthetic O
note O
, O
it O
is O
done O
to O
the O
German B-MISC
erotic O
photographers O
in O
the O
1930s O
: O

The O
free O
- O
body O
culture O
offered O
here O
the O
unforced O
opportunity O
to O
produce O
as O
compelled O
, O
valuable O
body O
images O
as O
possible O
. O

Until O
the O
more O
shameless O
, O
more O
aggressive O
images O
of O
current O
act O
photography O
, O
however O
, O
some O
commonalities O
of O
this O
genre O
can O
be O
found O
. O

Most O
often O
the O
body O
is O
used O
as O
a O
fabricated O
material O
, O
sometimes O
as O
an O
entire O
act O
figure O
, O
sometimes O
as O
a O
fragmented O
body O
landscape O
. O

The O
lust O
of O
the O
portrayed O
does O
not O
matter O
– O
what O
these O
images O
repeatedly O
reveal O
are O
rather O
the O
fantasies O
of O
the O
lightmakers O
, O
projected O
onto O
the O
bodies O
of O
their O
choice O
. O

Not O
always O
very O
imaginative O
. O

This O
is O
evident O
in O
the O
historical O
distance O
. O

The O
pornographic O
images O
from O
the O
early O
days O
of O
photography O
, O
around O
1850 O
, O
act O
only O
as O
illustrations O
of O
their O
time O
taste O
, O
hardly O
as O
erotic O
photographs O
. O

In O
touching O
pluminess O
, O
the O
revealed O
models O
are O
highlighted O
, O
with O
the O
long O
exposure O
times O
likely O
to O
have O
reinforced O
the O
slightly O
wooden O
poses O
. O

The O
viewer O
’s O
shameful O
and O
regrettable O
experience O
of O
voyeurism O
is O
the O
actual O
goal O
of O
these O
images O
– O
their O
design O
secondary O
. O

The O
desire O
had O
already O
disappeared O
from O
the O
picture O
. O

The O
somewhat O
drastic O
stages O
of O
newer O
dates O
are O
mostly O
aimed O
at O
the O
same O
old O
effects O
. O

As O
it O
is O
relaxing O
to O
also O
see O
alternatives O
to O
these O
scattered O
beauties O
. O

Far O
from O
common O
ideals O
is O
, O
for O
example O
, O
a O
chest O
image O
of O
Gundula B-PER
Schulze I-PER
. O

An O
old O
lady O
, O
scared O
, O
slightly O
insecure O
, O
but O
very O
seriously O
staring O
into O
the O
camera O
. O

The O
direct O
look O
out O
of O
the O
picture O
makes O
us O
scared O
to O
present O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
viewer O
. O

And O
so O
the O
woman O
appears O
as O
a O
dignified O
portrait O
, O
as O
a O
character O
study O
, O
not O
an O
object O
of O
pleasure O
. O

Similar O
to O
the O
old O
couple O
that O
held O
the O
Swede B-MISC
Jan B-PER
Bengtsson I-PER
in O
tender O
embrace O
. O

Scheidt B-PER
writes O
in O
the O
preface O
of O
the O
accompaniment O
catalogue O
that O
he O
has O
compiled O
" O
a O
purely O
subjective O
selection O
" O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
he O
does O
not O
make O
any O
artistic O
demands O
. O

Equally O
subjectively O
, O
the O
exhibition O
should O
also O
be O
considered O
and O
- O
in O
the O
most O
favorable O
case O
- O

in O

At O
5 O
o’clock O

the O

made O
themselves O

under O

the O

The O

a O

Of O

the O

Dagmar B-PER
Dominguez I-PER
was O
with O
the O
nerves O
at O
the O
end O
. O

Since O
ten O
after O
two O
, O
” O
the O

whispered O
, O
she O
had O
tried O
to O
“ O
wrap O

off O
” O
– O
“ O
at O
half O
three O

” O

So O
what O
Mrs. O
Dominguez B-PER
was O
sure O
, O
“ O
we O
’ve O
never O
had O
before O
” O
: O

That O
hundreds O
of O

stormed O
the O

The O

on O
the O
Berkersheimer B-LOC

– O
which O
was O
supposed O
to O
start O
only O
at O
15:00 O
– O
in O
fact O
broke O
all O
the O
records O
: O

Early O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
more O
than O
200 O

were O
already O
gathered O
in O
the O
large O

area O

Gradually O
, O
the O
summer O
festival O
developed O
into O
a O
district O

. O

Until O
recently O
it O
was O
different O
: O

“ O
Earlier O
, O
” O
Dagmar B-PER
Dominguez I-PER
recalled O
, O
“ O
the O
horizon O
of O
many O
people O
on O
the O
Frankfurt B-LOC

went O
only O
to O
the O

” O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
“ O

celebrated O
“ O
almost O
under O

” O

Since O
then O
, O
” O
says O
KT B-MISC

Alexandra B-PER
Götz I-PER
, O
“ O
we O
have O
gone O
out O
a O

and O
have O
done O
a O
crazy O
job O
there O
. O
” O

Successfully O
, O
as O
the O
Risenfete O
proved O
once O
again O
. O

The O
initial O
results O
could O
not O
change O
either O
: O

The O
gigantic O
" O
Hoppburg O
" O
for O
instance O
, O
which O
the O
caregivers O
had O
organized O
for O
their O
children O
, O
did O
not O
want O
to O
fill O
itself O
with O
air O
everywhere O
for O
hours O
. O

It O
was O
only O
when O
the O
fet O
was O
already O
in O
full O
swing O
that O
the O
plastic O
walls O
began O
to O
rise O
up O
- O
an O

experience O
for O
the O

. O

Many O
other O
attractions O
had O
the O
educators O
spread O
across O
their O
outdoors O
. O

There O
, O
a O
Seckbacher B-MISC
crawler O
attracted O
with O
a O
galop O
ride O
over O
the O
Frankfurt B-LOC
Mountain I-LOC
, O
while O
next O
to O
herbs O
could O
be O
flat O
- O
claped O
and O
air O
balloons O
could O
be O
shaved O
. O

The O
latter O
should O
then O
travel O
as O
many O
kilometers O
as O
possible O
in O
a O
long O

competition O

the O

But O
also O
in O
the O

– O
which O
first O
opened O
their O

20 O
years O
ago O

– O
the O
whole O
afternoon O
went O
through O

There O
, O
the O

had O
set O
up O

, O
which O
the O
Frankfurter B-MISC

For O
hours O
a O

those O

A O
huge O
success O
, O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
for O
KT B-MISC

Alexandra B-PER
Götz I-PER
. O

Especially O
if O

with O
the O

the O
“ O

, O
30 O

had O
prepared O
the O

last O

. O

In O
a O
relaxed O

the O

ate O

In O

the O

was O
“ O
an O

said O

The O
record O
height O

not O

, O
the O
parish O

Gudrun B-PER

speculated O

There O
was O
no O

of O
visitors O
this O
time O

Around O
500 O
community O

attended O
the O
feast O
on O
Saturday O

Sunday O

And O
since O
there O
were O
little O

" O
there O
is O

“ O

. O

The O

the O

put O
on O
a O

In O
the O

Under O
the O

in O
the O

, O
the O

had O
placed O

In O

Thus O
, O
it O
was O
almost O
2000 O
mark O
that O
the O
stone B-PER
handed O
over O
to O
Ilse B-PER
Wolf I-PER
from O
the O
“ O

Sick O

” O
– O
a O
remarkable O
sum O
for O
a O
small O
club O
that O
is O
only O
close O
to O
300 O
people O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
there O
were O
not O
a O
few O
more O
marks O
was O
due O
to O
the O
poor O
visit O
of O
the O
benefit O
game O
. O

Around O
80 O
football O
fans O
had O
come O
to O
the O
Rosegger B-LOC
sporting I-LOC
field I-LOC
. O

A O
fairly O
poor O
background O
to O
your O
football O
game O
for O
a O
good O
cause O
. O

Were O
the O
dark O
clouds O
of O
rain O
that O
threateningly O
hanged O
over O
the B-LOC
north O
of O
Frankfurt O
to O
blame O
? O

Or O
did O
the O
sports O
fans O
need O
a O
break O
after O
two O
tough O
Olympic B-MISC
weeks O
? O

The O
few O
spectators O
did O
not O
regret O
coming O
. O

The O
very O
big O
names O
were O
lacking O
in O
the O
ranks O
of O
public O
law O
. O

But O
they O
convinced O
with O
fighting O
spirit O
and O
above O
all O
with O
playful O
subtleties O
. O

0:2 O
the O
eleven O
from O
Bertramstraße B-LOC
were O
already O
behind O
; O
but O
the O
blue B-ORG
- I-ORG
whites I-ORG
fought O
once O
again O
and O
also O
placed O
goalkeeper O
Didi B-PER
Stein I-PER
two O
goals O
in O
the O
net O
. O

The O
routine O
of O
the O
BSC B-MISC
seniors I-MISC
was O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
black B-ORG
and I-ORG
white I-ORG
finally O
won O
with O
3:2 O
against O
the O
HR B-MISC
selection I-MISC
. O

For O
Ilse B-PER
Wolf I-PER
, O
too O
, O
the O
way O
to O
the O
sporting O
field O
at O
the O
Dornbusch B-LOC
was O
worthwhile O
. O

Not O
only O
the O
generous O
check O
from O
the O
athletes O
, O
but O
also O
the O
public O
attention O
in O
the O
fight O
against O
cancer O
can O
account O
for O
them O
as O
a O
profit O
for O
their O
organization O
: O

“ O
We O
need O
to O
become O
even O
more O
famous O
, O
because O
our O
association O
lives O
almost O
exclusively O
from O
donations O
. O
” O

In O
1982 O
, O
parents O
of O
children O
with O
cancer O
had O
decided O
to O
take O
action O
against O
the O
miserable O
conditions O
at O
the O
Uniclinic O
’s O
Children O
’s O
Cancer O
Station O
. O

Too O
small O
spaces O
and O
unsatisfactory O
care O
of O
children O
and O
parents O
were O
the O
main O
points O
of O
criticism O
. O

Although O
there O
are O
still O
only O
two O
toilets O
and O
two O
douches O
for O
the O
children O
, O
caregivers O
, O
doctors O
and O
caring O
parents O
. O

However O
, O
the O
situation O
at O
the O
station O
of O
Professor O
Bernhard B-PER
Kornhuber I-PER
has O
improved O
significantly O
in O
recent O
years O
: O

The O
association O
" O
Help B-ORG
for I-ORG
Cancer I-ORG
Children I-ORG
" O
bought O
new O
furniture O
and O
set O
up O
a O
modern O
kitchen O
, O
hired O
an O
educator O
and O
a O
psychologist O
. O

From O
October O
, O
even O
a O
family O
nurse O
will O
take O
care O
of O
the O
children O
and O
their O
parents O
. O

In O
two O
years O
, O
the O
expansion O
construction O
of O
the O
children O
's O
cancer O
station O
is O
to O
be O
completed O
and O
a O
large O
parent O
home O
is O
also O
planned O

With O
about O
a O
million O

“ O

almost O
sounds O

speaking O
out O

can O
quickly O
be O
convinced O

it O

just O
a O
few O
steps O
from O

“ O

However O
, O
this O
is O
a O
somewhat O
unusual O
name O
for O
a O
water O

in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
big O
city O
and O
in O
a O
corner O
where O
it O
can O
be O
easily O
overlooked O

However O
, O
earlier O
it O
was O
not O
only O
called O
differently O
, O
it O
also O
stood O
in O
a O
very O
different O

of O

it O

it O
was O
cleaned O
once O
a O
year O
from O
the O
chosen O

this O
was O
important O
to O
prevent O

After O
the O
" O
Brunnenfahrt O

there O
was O
a O
future O
feast O
- O
a O
custom O
to O
be O
remembered O
by O
the O
Brunnenfest B-MISC

Sachsenhausen B-LOC

which O
was O
celebrated O
these O
days O

Back O
to O
the O
Archaeological B-LOC

: O

In O
1789 O
, O
the O
Dribbdebächer O
built O
a O
pillar O
with O
pump O
construction O
instead O
of O
the O
medieval O

The O
stone O
was O
decorated O
on O
four O
sides O
with O
a O
crown O

which O
, O
as O
Helga B-PER

writes O
in O
her O

the O

as O
a O

a O

This O

repeated O
again O
in O
the O

Renovated O
in O

His O

as O

quotes O
it O
: O

“ O
He O
feared O
that O

have O
an O
adverse O

on O
the O

” O

This O
was O
not O
a O
misconception O
at O
that O
time O

She O
should O
confirm O
: O

On O
March O
8 O
of O
the O
year O
, O
the O

of O

there O

only O
in O

of O
the O

In O
1875 O
, O
the O
route O
was O
shortened O
and O
the O
local B-LOC

was O
converted O
into O
the O

But O
under O
“ O

the O

went O
on O
: O

only O
nine O

In O

Criticism O
of O
the O

came O
up O
. O

As O
early O
as O
1901 O
, O
it O
was O
said O
that O
it O
was O
no O

Ultimately O
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
the O
favorable O
route O
of O

through O

which O
led O
to O
the O
final O
out O
of O
the O
local O

in O
1955 O
. O

The O
result O
was O
the O
destruction O
of O
the O

He O
fell O
victim O
to O
the O

Gradually O
, O

, O
the O

As O
the O
plans O
for O
the O

matured O
in O
the O
late O

, O
people O

oscillated O
between O
the O

nostalgic O
memories O
. O

The O
washing O

came O
and O
for O
years O
the O

empty O
. O

It O
was O
only O
in O
the O
last O

, O
when O

became O
increasingly O
scarce O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC

that O

were O
also O
not O

after O
decades O
of O
priority O

the O

The O

debated O
the O
calming O

This O
is O
an O

but O
on O
the O
procedure O
, O
the O
district O

still O
do O
not O
agree O
. O

How O
can O
residents O
be O
informed O
about O
the O
calming O
of O

? O

How O
can O
they O
be O
involved O
in O
decisions O
? O

Politicians O
have O
been O
asking O
this O
question O
for O
a O
year O
now O
. O

The O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
and O
the O
surrounding O
streets O
were O
discussed O
at O
the O
last O
meeting O
of O
the O

. O

Four O

are O
now O
available O
by O
the O

Topp I-ORG
; O
a O
working O
group O
of O
politicians O
, O

has O
been O
meeting O
since O
August O
1991 O
. O

The O
results O
of O
the O
work O
are O
now O
to O
be O
presented O
to O
citizens O
in O
a O
hearing O
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
called O
in O
a O
petition O
: O

In O
questionnaires O
distributed O
during O
the O
hearing O
, O
residents O
could O
express O
their O
opinion O
and O
choose O
one O
of O
the O
options O
. O

The O
numbering O
of O
the O
arches O
is O
intended O
to O
ensure O
that O
everyone O
fills O
out O
only O
one O
questionnaire O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
argue O
, O
the O
calming O
of O
traffic O
in O
the O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
will O
not O
be O
delayed O
even O
longer O
. O

In O
September O
, O
the O
council O
may O
make O
a O
decision O
. O

The O
CDU B-ORG
, O
the O
largest O
group O
in O
the O
district B-ORG
council I-ORG
, O
does O
not O
want O
to O
know O
about O
this O
. O

In O
their O
opinion O
, O
only O
a O
more O
elaborate O
procedure O
can O
guarantee O
that O
the O
process O
will O
run O
democratically O
. O

Every O
resident O
around O
the O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
should O
receive O
a O
questionnaire O
explaining O
the O
variants O
. O

Even O
those O
who O
can O
not O
attend O
the O
hearing O
should O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
vote O
. O

After O
all O
, O

Hans O

This O
is O
a O
random O

” O

The O
Greens B-ORG
emphasize O
another O
practical O
point O
: O

" O
We O
have O
been O
discussing O
the O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
for O
years O
and O
you O
think O
you O
can O
present O
the O
matter O
in O
a O
few O
lines O
on O
the O
questionnaire O
, O
" O
said O
Freya B-PER
Linder I-PER
, O
a O
local O
counsel O
to O
the O
CDU B-ORG
. O

And O
with O
good O
reason O
: O

Because O
even O
when O
it O
was O
about O
the O
first O
zone O
in O
the O
district O
, O
the O
working O
group O
could O
not O
agree O
on O
the O
formulations O
for O
such O
a O
bow O
. O

They O
accused O
each O
other O
of O
not O
declaring O
neutral O
and O
trying O
to O
manipulate O
the O
inhabitants O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
project O
was O
co O
- O
spoken O
by O
the O
SPD B-ORG
, O
FDP B-ORG
and O
the O
Greens B-ORG
. O

However O
, O
the O
majority O
ratio O
this O
time O
looked O
different O
. O

Günther B-PER
Görtz I-PER
( O
FDP B-ORG
) O
, O
Zünglein O
an O

, O
voted O
with O
the O
CDU B-ORG
. O

The O
variants O
for O
the O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
are O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
easier O
to O
explain O
than O
the O
three O
variants O
for O
the O
first O
zone O
. O

Also O
also O
: O

“ O
If O
people O
still O
have O
questions O
, O
they O
can O
come O
to O
the O
hearing O
. O
” O

The O
SPD B-ORG
abstained O
. O
” O

We O
knew O
before O
that O
the O

proposal O
would O
be O
rejected O
, O
” O
said O
the O
group O
’s O
chairman O
, O
Karl B-PER
Semmelbauer I-PER
, O
who O
shares O
the O
Greens B-ORG
’ O
position O
. O

The O
proposal O
was O
adopted O
in O
an O
amended O
form O
: O

Each O
resident O
receives O
a O
questionnaire O
. O

This O
opens O
up O
a O

problem O
again O
. O

A O
survey O
is O
permitted O
only O
if O
no O
names O
and O

provided O
. O

This O
was O
decided O
by O
the O
Hessish B-LOC

Protection O
Officer O
when O
the O
local O

wanted O
to O
organize O
such O
a O

In O

Peter B-PER

The O
residential O

which O
were O

here O
almost O
exactly O
50 O

they O

Besides O
, O
in O
the O
business O
area O
, O
the O
time O
also O
seems O
to O
have O
stood O
still O
: O

however O
, O
the O

– O
this O
forgotten O
settlement O
in O
the O

Frankfurt B-MISC
– O

the O

of O
the O

designated O
as O
a O

. O

On O
the O
drawing O
board O
, O
everything O
looks O
quite O
different O
– O
in O
four O
years O
and O
under O
two O
city O
governments O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
beautiful O
ideas O
have O
accumulated O

” O

We O
want O
, O
” O
says O
Werner B-PER
Buch I-PER
, O
“ O
a O
moderate O
compression O
of O
the O
industrial O
area O
of O
the O
Industrial B-LOC
Court I-LOC
. O
” O

In O
other O
words O
: O

Where O
today O
industrial O
land O
and O
barracks O
lie O
, O
then O
medium O
- O
sized O
should O
find O
their O
place O
. O

Because O
they O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
can O
no O
longer O
withstand O
the O
“ O
repressive O
competition O
” O
in O
the O
city O
centre O
, O
the O
City B-LOC
- I-LOC
West I-LOC
or O
at O
the O
main O
train O
station O
. O

For O
them O
, O
the O
industrial B-LOC
yard I-LOC
should O
become O
the O
catchment O
pool O
that O
they O
can O
afford O
. O

The O
route O
from O
the O
planning O
desernate O
is O
clear O
: O

Manufacturing O
enterprises O
have O
priority O
over O
administrative O
buildings O
with O
their O
glass O
office O
towers O
– O
“ O
because O
they O
supersede O
everyone O
else O
because O
of O
their O
payability O
. O
” O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
urban O
planners O
want O
to O
“ O
protect O
existing O
residential O
buildings O
” O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
the O
immediate O
vicinity O
of O
the O
old O
rented O
barracks O
only O
" O
restricted O
trade O
" O
should O
be O
allowed O
, O
explains O
book B-PER
. O

Even O
the O
streets O
, O
in O
which O
large O
cracks O
were O
found O
today O
, O
should O
be O
greened O
thanks O
to O
the O
construction O
plan O
- O
" O
public O
green O
stripes O
" O

before O
the O
man O
from O
the O

The O
Rossittener O
Straße O
, O
besieged O
by O
commerce O
, O
is O
supposed O
to O
eventually O
be O
" O
converted O
" O
into O
a O
pure O
residential O
area O
- O
houses O
overlooking O
the O
neighboring O
small O

. O

All O
the O
grey O
theory O
. O

Whether O
it O
can O
be O
implemented O
is O
still O
in O
the O
stars O
. O

In O
some O
corners O
of O
the O
industrial B-LOC
court I-LOC
is O
currently O
being O
worked O
out O
- O
but O
the O
big O
concept O
is O
still O
waiting O
. O

Similarly O
it O
looks O
in O
the O
residential O
district O
Lötzener B-LOC

In O

but O
nothing O
has O
been O
done O
so O
far O

So O
it O
may O
still O
take O
time O
before O
the O
industrial B-LOC

actually O
becomes O
an O
“ O

Because O

really O

The O

unlike O
in O
the O
new O

of O
the O

– O
so O
structured O
that O
it O

immediately O
embedded O

There O
will O
be O
plenty O
of O
public O

meet O

“ O

A O

“ O
We O

” O

If O
it O

the O

However O
, O
they O
have O
to O

not O

it O

the O

is O
great O

he O
emphasizes O

” O

Per O
it O
’s O
also O
an O
advantage O
that O

Schermuly B-PER

are O

The O

much O
worse O

the O

What O
is O
liked O
to O
be O

the O
fact O
that O

As O
an O
example O

the O
success O

he O
calls O

The O

and O
Schermuly B-PER
: O

“ O

we O
get O
clear O
with O
it O

” O

The O
church O
should O
be O
a O
central O

is O
also O

for O
a O
better O

and O
Cucak B-PER
: O

“ O
There O
are O
numerous O
talented O
players O
who O
have O
come O
here O
from O
the O
war O
zones O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n’t O
get O
a O
work O
permit O
and O
therefore O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
play O
. O
” O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
hopes O
that O
the O
team O
, O
following O
the O
motto O
" O
Now O
quite O
a O
good O
start O
to O
the O
season O
. O
" O

Twenty O
years O
ago O
, O
Cucak B-PER
and O
four O
of O
his O
friends O
founded O
FC B-ORG
Tempo I-ORG
. O

The O
idea O
of O
the O
club O
name O
, O
explained O
by O
his O
own O
words O
" O
football O
crazy O
" O
- O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
activity O
at O
the O
FC B-ORG
Tempo I-ORG
he O
has O
been O
pumping O
points O
games O
for O
several O
years O
- O
had O
come O
to O
them O
at O
the O
time O
, O
because O
the O
team O
was O
successfully O
evaporated O
in O
the O
speed O
of O
the O
preparation O
games O
. O

And O
to O
this O
day O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
150 O
members O
are O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
a O
national O
club O
designation O
is O
unnecessary O
, O
as O
the O
Croatian B-MISC
league O
competitor O
Dubrovnik B-ORG
or O
AC B-ORG
Mladost I-ORG
( O
formerly O
Jugo B-ORG
Bornheim I-ORG
) O
have O
done O
. O

This O
changes O
, O
and O
Cucak B-PER
is O
sad O
about O
it O
, O
nothing O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
sponsors O
have O
withdrawn O
( O
the O
promised O
rise O
bonus O
could O
therefore O
not O
be O
paid O
) O
, O
the O
club O
of O
tournaments O
has O
been O
re O
- O
charged O
and O
the O
four O
youth O
teams O
as O
well O
as O
the O
departments O
of O
table O
tennis O
, O
chess O
, O
kegel O
and O
folklore O
had O
to O
be O
disbanded O
. O

The O
anniversary O
celebration O
for O
the O
20th O
anniversary O
of O
the O
association O
, O
planned O
in O
October O
, O
is O
therefore O
concerned O
with O
the O
chairman O
. O
" O

We O
do O
not O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
reasons O
to O
celebrate O
. O
” O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
pleasure O
that O
players O
can O
continue O
to O
use O
the O
place O
of O
Germania B-ORG
Ginnheim I-ORG
, O
both O
for O
the O
training O
twice O
a O
week O
and O
for O
the O
point O
games O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
neither O
an O
intact O
floodlight O
system O
there O
( O
the O
city O
has O
not O
fulfilled O
its O
promises O
, O
according O
to O
Cucak B-PER
) O
, O
nor O
a O
club O
home O
for O
the O
FC B-ORG
; O
after O
the O
games O
the O
kickers O
meet O
privately O
. O

Attempts O
to O
find O
their O
own O
place O
have O
so O
far O
failed O
: O

A O
problem O
that O
affects O
many O
clubs O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
. O

Therefore O
, O
a O
merger O
with O
the O
cultural O
and O
artistic O
association O
" O
Vuk B-ORG
Karadjic I-ORG
" O
is O
planned O
, O
which O
has O
rented O
spaces O
in O
the O
Käthe O
- O
Kollwitz B-LOC
house I-LOC
in O
the O
Lötzener B-LOC
Straße I-LOC
in O
the O
Industrial B-LOC
Garden I-LOC
. O

" O
It O
's O
hard O
to O
lead O
this O
club O
right O
now O
, O
where O
resentments O
openly O
come O
to O
light O
and O
sometimes O
we O
've O
already O
thought O
about O
dissolving O
, O
" O
says O
Lubomir B-PER
Cucak I-PER
. O

He O
is O
linked O
by O
a O
friendship O
with O
Eintracht B-MISC
coach I-MISC
Dragoslav B-PER
Stepanovic I-PER
, O
who O
comes O
to O
the O
games O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
( O
with O
him O
Cucak B-PER
played O
in O
his O
youth O
in O
Belgrade B-LOC
) O
" O
but O
then O
we O
gathered O
together O
and O
thought O
about O
the O
future O
. O

It O
can O
only O
get O
better O
, O
that O
’s O
our O
hope O
. O
” O

The O
players O
will O
be O
attracted O
and O
also O
the O
good O
soul O
of O
the O
club O
, O
witness O
Djordje B-PER
Jovicic I-PER
. O

At O
the O
start O
of O
the O
season O
, O
it O
was O
for O
everyone O
: O

Two O
points O
must O
be O
here O
. O

The O
sport O
is O
meant O
to O
make O
politics O
forget O
on O
the O
pitch O
for O
at O
least O
90 O
minutes O
. O

At O
the O
first O
game O
of O
the O
new O
season O
, O
the O
FC B-ORG
as O
the O
host O
again O
made O
all O
honour O
to O
his O
name O

In O
the O

” O

Come O

. O

All O
in O
the O
sign O
of O
the O
sport O
for O
young O
and O
old O
was O
the O
summer O
play O
festival O
of O
the O
traditional O
club O
, O
which O
has O
existed O
since O
1881 O
. O

Especially O
the O
more O
than O
200 O
children O
who O
had O
come O
had O
great O
fun O
at O
the O
games O
that O
the O
organizer O
Rolf B-PER
Heinekke I-PER
, O
technical O
director O
of O
Jahnvolk B-ORG
, O
had O
prepared O
. O

On O
the O
large O
lawn O
she O
was O
waiting O
for O
a O
difficult O
path O
: O

They O
had O
to O
overcome O
the O
obstacles O
tournaments O
, O
bowls O
, O
boxes O
, O
swing O
bars O
, O
bars O
and O
a O
mini O
- O
trampoline O
. O

They O
did O
so O
with O
great O
enthusiasm O
; O
many O
of O
them O
showed O
themselves O
extremely O
devoted O
and O
vigorous O
. O

Subsequently O
, O
the O
little O
ones O
were O
able O
to O
recover O
from O
the O
efforts O
on O
a O
carousel O
ride O
– O
or O
on O
the O

” O

The O
festival O
programme O
will O
be O
strongly O
accepted O
by O
visitors O
this O
year O
, O
” O
said O
press O

honorary O

Karl B-PER
Fraund I-PER
. O

Almost O
everyone O
is O
actively O
involved O
in O
the O
games O
and O
exercises O
. O

This O
time O
it O
worked O
better O
, O
he O
explained O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
that O
the O
agreement O
between O
the O
different O
departments O
was O
better O
than O
otherwise O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
Fraund B-PER
highlighted O
the O
involvement O
of O
young O
people O
in O
the O
association O
. O
” O

When O
I O
see O
them O
engaging O
here O
, O
I O
ca O
n’t O
even O
understand O
that O
many O
people O
are O
discouragingly O
talking O
about O
youth O
. O
” O

Especially O
the O
boys O
and O
girls O
of O
the O
fistball O
department O
would O
have O
helped O
intensively O
in O
the O
upgrading O
and O
demolition O
of O
the O
gym O
equipment O
, O
he O
said O
. O

A O
total O
of O
200 O
youths O
are O
actively O
training O
in O
the O
club O
; O
in O
addition O
to O
faustball O
( O
the O
women O
's O
team O
plays O
in O
the O

, O
there O
is O

Recently O
, O
a O
spinal O

group O
has O
also O
met O
in O
the O
unified O
hall O
for O
training O
. O

More O
and O
more O
people O
have O
access O
to O
this O
sport O
. O

The O
number O
of O
members O
has O
almost O
doubled O
in O
recent O
years O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
: O

Here O
and O
there O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
training O
leaders O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
there O
are O
only O
a O
few O
volunteer O
caregivers O
who O
find O
that O
money O
plays O
a O
too O
big O
role O
in O
many O
, O

The O

next O
to O

School I-ORG
is O
to O
be O
included O
in O
the O
planned O
ecological O
transformation O
of O
the O
school O
yard O
. O

This O
was O
asked O
by O
Waltraud B-PER
Leckel I-PER
, O
school O
leader O
at O
the O
Eichendorff B-ORG
School I-ORG
during O
the O
last O

( O
Goldstein B-LOC

. O

If O
the O
city O
’s O
playgrounds O
were O
opened O
for O
schoolchildren O
, O
more O
space O
could O
be O
created O
in O
the O
school O

, O
the O
school O
’s O
director O
explained O
. O

It O
is O
much O
too O
small O
. O

Temporarily O
, O
600 O
children O
aged O
3 O
to O
16 O
are O
staying O
there O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

On O
the O
asphalt O
floor O
, O
students O
regularly O
injured O
themselves O
. O

The O
playground O
looks O
uncomfortable O
, O
” O
according O
to O
Waltraud B-PER
Lekkel I-PER
, O
“ O
so O
no O
child O
uses O
it O
. O

If O
the O
site O
is O
equipped O
with O
new O
play O
equipment O
, O
we O
can O
build O
a O
pond O
and O
a O
school O
garden O
on O
the O
yard O
. O
” O

Waltraud B-PER
Leak I-PER
pleads O
for O
breaking O
down O
the O
wall O
between O
school O
yard O
and O
playground O
and O
installing O
a O
lockable O
door O
into O
the O
gap O
. O
” O

So O
we O
can O
that O
the O
children O
only O
go O
to O
the O
neighboring O
area O
in O
the O
breaks O
. O

in O
the O

Probably O
the O
most O

Heinz B-PER
Riesenhuber I-PER
, O
who O
felt O
visibly O
comfortable O
in O
the O
Schwanheimer B-MISC

But O
it O
was O
not O
only O
politicians O
who O
had O
been O
asked O
to O
open O

” O

It O
is O
not O

" O
said O

Bernhard B-PER

We O
have O

invited O

come O

talk O
to O
us O
, O
” O
the O
local O
politician O
continued O
. O

There O
were O
even O
more O
people O
coming O
than O
invites O
were O
sent O
. O

The O
garden O
area O
was O
filled O
with O
about O
200 O
guests O
to O
the O
last O
spot O
, O
one O
listened O
to O
the O
woman O
at O
the O
spinning O
organ O
and O
the O
rich O
buffet O
, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
Mertens B-PER
, O
was O
" O
almost O
only O
funded O
by O

of O
Schwanheimer B-MISC
shops O
" O
. O

Those O
who O
were O
looking O
for O
politicians O
from O
the O
other O
big O
party O
had O
to O
look O
long O
and O
very O
closely O
. O

Only O
Hans B-PER
Dick I-PER
, O
chairman O
of O
the O
Schwanheim B-ORG
SPD I-ORG
local I-ORG
club I-ORG
, O
trusted O
himself O
under O
the O
“ O
black O
mass O
” O
. O

However O
, O
he O
was O
not O
shy O
because O
of O
his O
individual O
position O
. O

Anxiously O
, O
he O
chatted O
with O
the O
political O
opponent O
- O
what O
such O
a O
cool O
beer O
is O
all O
about O
. O

“ O
I O
am O
pleased O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
our O
friends O
from O

” O
explained O
Bernhard B-PER
Mertens I-PER
. O

Like O
last O
year O
, O
the O
party O

from O

come O
to O

the O

of O
1,300 O

, O

lies O
between O
Eisenach B-LOC

Gotha B-LOC
, O
welcomed O
the O
close O
relationship O
with O
the O
Schwanheim B-ORG
CDU I-ORG
: O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
real O
friendship O
has O
grown O
from O
acquaintances O
. O

Since O
the O
turn O
there O
has O
been O
an O
intense O
contact O
between O
the O
party O

. O

The O
“ O

” O
supported O
the O
election O

of O
their O
Eastern O

technically O
and O
organizationally O
. O

Sometimes O
we O
went O
to O
Mechterstädt B-LOC

a O

" O
The O
role O
of O

so O
the O

today O
also O
has O
a O

” O
explained O
the O

According O
to O
his O

the O

more O

” O

We O
are O

so O

However O
, O
a O

already O
pointed O
to O
the O
next O

point O

" O
the O

feared O

Their O
proposal O
: O

Also O
the O
Lersnerstraße B-LOC

the O

should O
be O
partially O
" O

However O
, O
the O

declared O
the O

, O
this O

encountered O
massive O

The O

for O

that O

And O
the O
calming O

would O
also O
benefit O

In O
the O
Roman B-LOC

, O
the O

explained O
. O

It O
will O
not O
be O
flattered O
. O

In O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
city O
, O
residents O
had O
often O
criticized O
the O
high O
road O
barriers O
. O

The O
reason O
: O

The O
cars O
made O
too O
much O
noise O
when O
slowing O
down O
and O
accelerating O
. O

This O
is O
different O
with O
the O
Cologne B-MISC
plates O
: O

The O
metal O
discs O
, O
slightly O
elevated O
in O
the O
middle O
, O

be O
easily O

Generally O
speaking O
, O

want O
to O
avoid O
high O

in O
the O

The B-PER
Wolf I-PER
: O

“ O
We O
ca O

of O

” O

because O
: O

" O
The O
acceptance O
of O
the O
locals O
is O
the O
best O
advertisement O
for O

30 O
zones O
. O
" O

The O
engineers O
also O
looked O
beyond O
safety O
. O

The O
result O
: O

A O
total O
of O
nine O

will O
be O
planted O
on O
the O

only O

The O

In O

the O

not O
make O
a O

" O
In O

In O
order O
to O
ensure O
equal O
conditions O
for O
all O
shepherds O
, O
all O
nine O
shepherds O
must O
have O
the O

. O

With O
more O
than O
nine O
shepherds O
per O
day O
, O
the O
burden O
on O
the O
animals O
would O
be O
too O
great O
. O

For O
every O
shepherd O
in O
KirchGöns B-LOC
had O
to O
prove O
with O
his O
dogs O
for O
about O
three O
- O
quarters O
of O
an O
hour O
that O
he O
could O
safely O
and O
properly O
lead O
a O
flock O
. O

This O
is O
mainly O
about O
the O
interaction O
between O
man O
and O

, O
says O
Oberhauser B-MISC
Heinrich B-PER

Hat O
Contest O
. O

by O
Heinrich B-PER
Müller I-PER
: O

It O
is O
evaluated O
, O
for O
example O
, O
whether O
the O
dogs O
respond O
correctly O
to O
danger O
, O
whether O
they O
also O
master O
one O
of O
the O
few O
correct O
bites O
with O
which O
they O
do O
not O
harm O
the O
sheep O
, O
whether O
they O
listen O
to O
their O
master O
and O
also O
whether O
they O
can O
independently O
oversee O
the O
flock O
. O

About O
two O
years O
, O
reports O
his O
colleague O
Reinhold B-PER
Schmid I-PER
, O
the O
employed O
German B-MISC
Shepherd O
dogs O
need O
to O
master O
all O
this O
. O

But O
even O
the O
best O
training O
and O
the O
greatest O
experience O
sometimes O
do O
not O
benefit O
much O
, O
for O
the O
animals O
, O
like O
humans O
, O
are O
subject O
to O
fluctuations O
in O
performance O
. O
” O

Especially O
in O
the O
current O
dog O
days O
with O
heavily O
fluctuating O
temperatures O
, O
sometimes O
the O
dogs O
are O
quite O
out O
of O
the O
role O
, O
” O
says O
Müller B-PER
. O

So O
some O
animals O
would O
have O
shown O
much O
better O
performance O
in O
the O
preliminary O
decisions O
. O

For O
the O
dogs O
, O
such O
a O
competition O
also O
brings O
with O
it O
much O
unknown O
, O
because O
the O
shepherd O
and O
his O
dogs O
do O
not O
know O
the O
flock O
. O

It O
can O
happen O
that O
the O
herd O
becomes O
nervous O
and O
suddenly O
drives O
the O
dogs O
. O

This O
did O
not O
happen O
in O
Kirch B-LOC
- I-LOC
Göns I-LOC
, O
but O
considerable O
services O
were O
also O
required O
from O
the O
shepherds O
. O

If O
, O
for O
example O
, O
a O
herd O
of O
about O
320 O
sheep O
runs O
on O
a O
street O
just O
over O
three O
meters O
wide O
, O
as O
in O
Kirch B-LOC
- I-LOC
Göns I-LOC
, O
it O
pulls O
on O
a O
distance O
of O
more O
than O
300 O
meters O
from O
each O
other O
and O
must O
be O
kept O
together O
. O

In O
Kirch B-LOC
- I-LOC
Göns I-LOC
the O
shepherds O
flocked O
over O
the O
sharply O
falling O
prices O
that O
would O
drive O
them O
to O
ruin O
. O

The O
chairman O
of O
the O
Shepherd O
Association O
of O

Nassau I-ORG
, O
Friedrich B-PER
Schlosser I-PER
: O

“ O
Five O
, O
six O
years O

, O
we O
still O
got O
between O
3.50 O
mark O
and O
4 O
mark O
per O

for O
wool O
. O

Today O
it O
’s O

“ O
It O

much O
better O

If O
years O

there O
were O
nine O
to O
ten O
marks O
per O

, O
now O
there O
are O
only O
five O
to O
six O
marks O
. O

Without O
the O
EC B-ORG
slaughter O
premiums O
, O
many O
shepherds O
would O
be O
bankrupt O
, O
according O
to O
him O
. O

Therefore O
, O
today O
a O
shepherd O
must O
have O
at O
least O
one O
flock O
of O
500 O
mothers O
to O
survive O
. O

The O
price O
drop O
is O
attributed O
to O
increasing O
competition O
from O
Ireland B-LOC
or O
New O

, O
where O
flocks O
with O
thousands O
of O
sheep O
can O
graze O
on O
vast O
areas O
. O

However O
, O
this O
is O
not O
possible O
in O
intensely O
agricultural O
regions O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
pastures O

Because O
for O
twelve O
sheep O
and O
their O
lambs O
, O
including O
the O

When O

the O

12:4 O

” O
Eufinger B-PER
analyzed O

Sometimes O
only O

The O
result O
: O

2 O

: O

“ O

” O
as O
the O

meant O

But O
the O
head O
does O
not O
let O
the O
kicker O
of O
the O

hang O
. O

With O
full O
steam O
it O
should O
go O
into O
the O

, O
and O
, O
as O
it O
sounds O
: O

“ O
The O
team O
is O
stronger O
than O
last O

. O

This O
was O
already O
reflected O
in O
the O

, O

Until O

the O

The O
reason O
for O

So O
if O
it O

the O

board O
had O
renounced O
the O
water O
rights O
for O
the O
boat O
sprinkler O
, O
which O
was O
necessary O
to O
water O
boats O
. O

The O
reason O
: O

Members O
had O
little O
interest O
at O
the O
time O
, O
the O
expenses O
for O
the O
facility O
would O
have O
been O
meaningless O
. O

In O
1982 O
, O
a O
new O
board O
attempted O
to O
regain O
the O
rights O
. O

However O
, O
the O
request O
was O
rejected O
by O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Water O
and O
Shipping O
. O

Another O
attempt O
followed O
in O
1991 O
, O
with O
the O
same O
result O
. O

But O
: O

This O
time O
, O
Willi B-PER
Maser I-PER
, O
deputy O
chairman O
and O
treasurer O
, O
read O
the O
letter O
more O
closely O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
the O
rejection O
was O
for O
a O
planting O
site O
for O
larger O
boats O
and O
not O
a O
boat O
sprinkler O
for O
the O
runners O
. O

this O

With O
this O

Some O

For O

The O

the O
time O
that O

Before O

built O
in O
Arolsen B-LOC

Landau I-LOC
, O
the O

Sylvia B-PER

of O
the O

of O
the O
citizens O
of O
Frankfurt B-MISC
to O
the O
communication O
of O
the O

that O
exceptions O

would O
be O
requested O
from O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
to O
ensure O
the O
game O
operation O
in O
some O

Otherwise O
, O
these O
exceptions O
are O
intended O
to O
apply O
only O
to O
point O
games O
or O
major O
tournaments O
. O

The O
phone O
did O
not O
stand O
still O
. O

And O
our O
concern O
is O
encountering O
great O
resistance O
among O
the O
population O
, O
” O
explained O
the O
city O
council O
. O

According O
to O
her O
, O
the O
clubs O
also O
have O
to O
expect O
to O
survive O
largely O
without O
water O
. O

For O
sports O
such O
as O
hockey O
, O
which O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
is O
now O
played O
almost O
exclusively O
on O
artificial O
grass O
( O
which O
must O
be O
wet O
due O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
injury O
) O
, O
the O
water O
emergency O
without O
exception O
means O
the O
out O
. O

Similarly O
, O
it O
is O
about O
the O
tennis O
courts O
, O
which O
also O
need O
to O
be O
filled O
with O
the O
precious O
wet O
so O
as O
to O
be O
playable O
. O

Football O
players O
will O
not O
be O
affected O
so O
hard O
. O

Hard O
places O
should O
be O
humidified O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
otherwise O
the O
dust O
development O
will O
be O
too O
large O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
grasslands O
can O
even O
burn O
without O
water O
in O
high O
heat O
. O

On O
proposals O
for O
solutions O
, O
the O
clubs O
discussed O
with O
representatives O
of O
the O
Sports B-ORG
and I-ORG
Bath I-ORG
Office I-ORG
. O

They O
talked O
about O
ways O
to O
save O
water O
by O
taking O
a O
shorter O
shower O
or O
capturing O
rainwater O
in O
tanks O
. O

Another O
suggestion O
was O
to O
use O
sewage O
water O
that O
could O
bring O
the O
volunteer B-ORG
fire I-ORG
department I-ORG
to O
the O
sports O
facilities O
( O
see O
the O
box O
below O
) O
. O

Consumer O
water O
should O
not O
be O
in O
the O
tanks O
) O
. O

But O
even O
the O
concerns O
of O
the O
associations O
, O
which O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
water O
, O
the O
desertant O
listened O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
subject O
of O
new O
electricity O
tariffs O
that O
no O
longer O
take O
into O
account O
a O
basic O
fee O
. O

This O
fee O
has O
so O
far O
been O
paid O
by O
the O
city O
to O
relieve O
the O
clubs O
. O

Sylvia B-PER
Schenk I-PER
was O
able O
to O
reassure O
: O

This O
year O
, O
at O
least O
, O
the O
old O
rule O
applies O
again O
. O

A O
representative O
of O
the O
Ruder B-ORG
Club I-ORG
Griesheim I-ORG
complained O
about O
the O
sluggish O
negotiations O
with O
the O
Water B-ORG
and I-ORG
Shipping I-ORG
Office I-ORG
in O
Aschaffenburg B-LOC
to O
regain O
the O
water O
rights O
for O
a O

. O

Sylvia B-PER
Schenk I-PER
promised O
support O
for O
this O
case O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
representative O
of O
the O
sports B-ORG
community I-ORG
of O
Griesheim O
addressed O
an O
old O
problem O
. O

The O
sports O
fields O
and O
the O
functional O
buildings O
with O
shower O
and O
dressing O
rooms O
are O
in O
poor O
condition O
( O
the O

Rundschau O
) O
. O

However O
, O
the O
SG B-MISC
representative I-MISC
did O
not O
hear O
anything O
new O
. O

With O
normal O
operation O
, O
the O
renovation O
of O
the O
office O
would O
have O
begun O
and O
completed O
in O
1993 O
, O
Ms. O
Schenk B-PER
said O
. O

The O
funds O
for O
the O
artificial O
grass O
area O
are O
expected O
to O
be O
allocated O
for O
1994 O
. O

In O
the O
mid-1990s O
, O
the O
SG B-ORG
could O
play O

again O
under O

now O
the O

The O
special O
commitment O
of O
Hermann B-PER

due O
to O
the O

that O

The O

it O

" O
New O
beetles O
return O
well O
" O
- O
a O
wisdom O
that O
is O
not O
always O
true O
. O

Regarding O
the O
renewal O
of O
heating O
systems O
, O
however O
, O
it O
applies O
to O
: O

The O
last O
few O
years O
have O
led O
to O
new O
discoveries O
and O
serious O
improvements O
in O
heating O
technology O
. O

Anyone O
who O
still O
uses O
an O
older O
heating O
system O
at O
home O
should O
have O
a O
professional O
forecast O
how O
much O
energy O
and O
money O
he O
can O
save O
with O
a O
new O
, O
modern O
system O
. O

If O
the O
boiler O
is O
older O
than O
ten O
years O
, O
one O
can O
with O
high O
probability O
assume O
a O
saving O
potential O
of O
more O
than O
20 O
percent O
. O

Adding O
that O
, O
as O
a O
rule O
, O
the O
maintenance O
costs O
of O
a O
new O
plant O
decrease O
significantly O
, O
the O
investment O
will O
be O
depreciated O
within O
a O
few O
years O
. O

But O
there O
is O
another O
reasonable O
argument O
: O

On O
30 O
September O
1993 O
, O
the O
transitional O
period O
of O
the O
first O
Federal O
Regulation O
on O
Immigration O
Protection O
expires O
. O

At O
the O
latest O
from O
that O
date O
, O
old O
- O
fashioned O
plants O
must O
also O
comply O
with O
the O
new O
, O
significantly O
tightened O
limit O
values O
. O

Lower O
energy O
consumption O
means O
increased O
use O
of O
fuel O
. O

This O
automatically O
reduces O
the O
production O
of O
pollutants O

The O

to O
provide O

In O
1991 O
, O
the O

had O
assumed O
the O
task O
of O
supporting O
a O

After O
the O

the O

the O
two O

now O
able O

technically O
challenging O

. O

The O
focus O
is O
always O
on O
saving O

For O

, O
it O
was O
studied O

But O
this O

“ O
I O

” O
said O

Edmund B-PER

The O
CDU B-ORG
had O
asked O
the O

indicated O
the O

, O
modern O

The O
Christian B-ORG

also O
called O
for O

. O

The O
hygienic O
requirements O
were O
not O
met O
for O
this O
, O
the O

now O
informed O
, O
so O
no O

This O
can O
only O
happen O
again O
when O
a O

Only O
then O
, O

Some O
people O
do O
n’t O
like O
to O
hear O
it O
and O
feel O
it O
as O
discrimination O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
like O
this O
: O

Books O
are O
waste O
materials O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
examples O
are O
available O
to O
work O
beyond O
the O
day O
. O

Publishers O
and O
authors O
dream O
of O
such O
wonders O
. O

But O
as O
I O
said O
: O

Few O
are O
chosen O
. O

Admitted O
by O
: O

This O
situation O
is O
unsatisfactory O
. O

Not O
only O
for O
the O
bookwriters O
and O
sellers O
, O
but O
the O
reader O
is O
also O
not O
quite O
happy O
with O
rubbish O
reading O
. O

In O
such O
misguided O
situations O
there O
is O
a O
probate O
recommendation O
that O
opens O
the O
way O
out O
of O
the O
dilemma O
: O

“ O
Let O
’s O
come O
up O
with O
something O
, O
” O
is O
the O
magic O
word O
. O

A O
renowned O
publisher O
( O
the O
name O
is O
meaningless O
) O
came O
up O
with O
something O
. O

The O
invention O
was O
so O
brilliant O
that O
it O
could O
compete O
with O
the O
“ O
Egg O
of O
Columbus B-PER
” O
: O

In O
a O
very O
ordinary O
criminal O
novel O
, O
there O
were O
16 O
( O
in O
words O
: O

Sixteen O
pages O
of O
text O
missed O
, O
missed O
. O

A O
flash O
of O
spirit O
, O
which O
causes O
the O
reader O
to O
surprise O
the O
unbeliever O
at O
first O
. O

The O
next O
reaction O
: O

That O
does O
not O
exist O
at O
all O
. O

But O
then O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
life O
always O
brings O
new O
surprises O
. O

The O
“ O

in O
the O
book O
” O
really O
exists O

. O

In O
order O
to O
understand O
the O
dramatics O
of O
this O
gap O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
briefly O
explain O
what O
it O
is O
about O

It O
is O
about O

For O
what O
else O
? O

Private O

on O
track O
for O
the O

Millon B-PER

not O

that O

The O
beautiful O

close O

it O
does O

( O

at O
all O

From O
page O
177 O
, O
however O
, O
Kinsey B-PER
goes O
clearly O
to O
distance O
, O
and O
worst O
of O
all O
, O
she O
leaves O
the O
reader O
alone O
with O
the O
question O
: O

Why O
is O
? O

What O
about O

of O
mind- O

The O
Doc- O

Come O

? O

What O
has O
happened O
on O
these O
non O

pages O
, O
what O
has O
moved O
our O
heroine O
( O
with O
the O
little O
automatic O
) O
now O
to O
act O
as O
if O
there O
had O
never O

the O
love O
adventure O
? O

Did O
she O
suspect O
that O
yesterday O
’s O
lover O
was O
not O
so O
adorable O
? O

For O
the O
reader O
, O
this O
is O
of O
crucial O
importance O
, O
because O
on O
page O
204 O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
she O
pushes O
him O
away O
( O
with O
the O
little O
automatic O
) O
. O

However O
, O
not O
just O
because O
she O
ca O
n’t O
suffer O
him O
anymore O
. O

The O
man O
’s O
feelings O
for O
the O
detective O
had O
also O
changed O
significantly O
: O

At O
the O
last O
encounter O
, O
in O
his O
right O
hand O
was O
a O
slaughter O
knife O
with O
a O
twenty O
- O
five O
centimeters O
long O
blade O
. O

Against O
the O
backdrop O
of O
the O
sad O
ending O
, O
the O
reader O
’s O
unrest O
becomes O
understandable O
, O
who O
now O
breaks O
his O
head O
for O
an O
unexpected O
time O
about O
what O
has O
escaped O
him O
on O
the O
missing O
pages O
. O

But O
through O
this O
little O
, O
harmless O
trick O
, O
the O
dream O
of O
publisher O

comes O
true O
: O

This O

not O
simply O
put O

No O
, O
it O

" O
the O
people O

keep O
the O

About O
250 O

signed O
up O

After O
the O
Pathfinder O

, O
there O
were O
still O

from O

40 O

“ O
Every O

a O
good O

” O
and O
“ O
always O

” O
were O
the O
guidelines O
of O
the O
Pathfinder O
movement O

This O
is O
somewhat O
outdated O
today O
, O
” O
says O
Sylvia B-PER

For O
them O
, O
the O
function O
of O
the O
trailfinder O
has O
changed O
: O

" O
We O
want O
to O
promote O
group O
life O
, O
practice O
solidarity O
and O
learn O
to O
develop O
understanding O
of O
each O
other O
's O
weaknesses O
. O
" O

The O
children O
should O
learn O
that O
“ O
not O
everything O
is O
going O
to O
their O
way O
” O
but O
that O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
whole O
group O
must O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
. O

Yet O
there O
is O
a O
tribal O
life O
: O

The O

even O
have O
their O
own O

on O
Sachsenhäuser B-LOC

where O
the O

built O
a O

On O
the O
regular O
group O

in O
the O

the O

consider O
their O

Fritz B-PER
Bultmann I-PER
, O
managing O
director O
of O
the O
Consumer B-ORG
Protection I-ORG
Association I-ORG
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
sees O
in O
the O
advertising O
of O
“ O

” O
a O
“ O
some O
misleading O
” O
of O
the O
consumer O
. O

If O
the O
company O
advertises O
with O
it O
, O
the O
cassette O
could O
be O
ordered O
to O
view O
, O
" O
says O
Bultmann B-PER
, O
" O
and O
view O
is O
then O
called O
: O

I O
can O
see O
the O
thing O
through O
the O
slide O
– O
then O
that O
’s O
already O
misleading O
. O
” O

According O
to O
Bultmanns B-PER
, O
the O
company O
should O
clarify O
in O
its O
advertisement O
that O
a O
“ O
order O
for O
view O
” O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
the O
customer O
can O
push O
the O
cassette O
into O
his O
video O
recorder O
. O

Bultmann B-PER
therefore O
wants O
to O
have O
it O
examined O
whether O
the O
Amsterdam B-MISC
book O
and O
media O
shipment O
can O
be O
dismissed O
for O
violation O
of O
paragraph O
3 O
of O
the O
competition O
law O
. O

If O
the O
company O
does O
not O
react O
then O
the O
consumer O
protection O
association O
can O
also O
file O
a O
complaint O
against O
a O
Dutch B-MISC
company O
. O

Could O
the O
customer O
open O
the O
cassette O
anyway O
? O
” O

No O
of O
course O
! O
” O

This O
is O
clear O
to O
the O
consumer O
advocate O
. O
” O

The O
moment O
the O
customer O
receives O
the O
cassette O
, O
he O
concludes O
a O
contract O
for O
purchase O
on O
sample O
and O
enters O
into O
the O
terms O
that O
the O
company O
dictates O
in O
his O
letter O

” O

Bultmann B-PER
therefore O
recommends O
disappointed O
customers O
who O
do O
n't O
want O

buy O

The O

there O
were O
plenty O

One O

pull O

invited O

In O
November O

The O

In O
this O
miserable O
situation O
, O
the O

themselves O
up O

Finally O
, O
the O
State O

Municipal O
Youth O

and O
other O

also O
gave O
their O

At O
the O

however O
, O
seven O

But O
in O
December O

, O
Molly B-PER
Matthes I-PER
received O
the O

from O
the O

: O

The O

, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
Molly B-PER
Matthes I-PER
, O
is O
not O
enough O
. O

However O
, O
the O
association O
may O
not O
use O
a O
cellar O
or O

. O

The O
city O
has O
not O
yet O
made O
a O
definitive O
decision O
on O
how O
it O
will O
use O
the O

For O
this O
reason O

the O

only O
valid O

But O
that O
is O
not O
the O
only O
problem O

The O
ABM O

at O
the O
end O
of O
this O
year O
, O
can O
no O
longer O
be O

in O
the O
future O
due O
to O
lack O
of O

The O
consequence O
: O

One O
of O
the O
four O

must O
be O
dissolved O
. O

Subsidies O
for O

“ O

the O

” O
says O
Molly B-PER
Matthes I-PER
, O
“ O

Given O
the O

Karlheinz B-PER

him O

Originally O
it O
may O
have O
been O
curiosity O
that O
has O
driven O
the O
Frankfurter B-MISC
into O
the O
Old O

, O
when O
they O
heard O
that O
Stockhausen B-PER
- O
once O
as O
a O
terrible O
child O
of O
modern O
music O
- O
would O
stand O
on O
the O

and O
direct O
one O
of O
his O
works O
. O

But O
at O
the O
latest O
after O

, O
it O
had O
become O
clear O
to O
many O
that O
here O

in O

of O
all O

- O
there O
is O
no O

someone O
who O
has O
something O
to O

gives O
us O
the O
opportunity O
to O
take O
a O
look O
into O
his O

becoming O

He O
explains O
his O

, O
explains O
, O
supported O

the O

, O
how O
his O

how O

does O
the O

at O

” O
Felsing B-PER
reports O

Last O

the O

were O
found O
in O
265 O

In O
the O
case O
of O

, O
Felsing B-PER
explains O
, O
“ O
there O
is O
a O
rare O
cactus O

” O

The O

game O
with O

: O

For O
example O
, O
there O
was O
between O
a O

of O

for O

an O

can O
be O
obtained O
, O
one O
whose O
species O
is O

It O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
task O
for O
the O
customs O
officers O
to O
get O
this O
one O
out O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
passenger O
traffic O
, O
the O
smuggling O
of O

is O
more O
of O
an O
individual O

Although O
Customs O

can O
still O
remember O
the O

three O
South O
American O

- O
only O

I O
never O
thought O
an O

could O
survive O
. O
” O

At O
prices O
between O
5,000 O
and O
15,000 O
marks O
for O
rare O
parrot O
, O
it O
is O
worthwhile O
for O
the O
smuggler O
- O
" O
mostly O
a O
cognizant O
" O
- O
even O
if O
only O
one O
bird O
arrives O
alive O

The O
secured O
animals O
are O
passed O
on O
to O
the O
zoo O
or O
plants O
at O
the O

We O
are O
lucky O
there O
, O
if O
we O
did O
n’t O
have O
them O
, O
the O
animals O
or O
plants O
would O
be O
ruined O
, O
” O
says O
Felsing B-PER
. O

Most O
travellers O
, O
however O
, O
are O
not O
caught O
with O
live O
animals O
, O
but O
with O
articles O
made O
of O
them O
: O

Boots O
, O
wallets O
made O
of O

or O
the O
latest O

: O

Bags O
of O

The O
excuses O
of O
the O
wiped O
are O
always O
the O
same O
. O
” O

But O
the O
animal O
was O
already O
dead O
, O
” O
they O
often O
say O
. O

A O
response O
that O
Wohlfarth B-PER
does O
not O
apply O
: O

“ O
If O
protection O
applies O
to O
an O
animal O
species O
, O
then O
it O
applies O
to O
the O
dead O
animals O
as O
well O
. O
” O

The O
turtle O
soup O
is O
as O
protected O
as O
the O
turtle O
itself O
. O

And O
yet O
another O
excuse O
: O

The O
ivory O
bracelet O
is O
just O
an O
old O
“ O
family O
piece O
, O
” O
it O
is O
often O
said O
. O

But O
here O
too O
, O
the O
customsmen O
remain O
tough O
. O

If O
the O
traveler O
ca O
n't O
prove O
that O
the O
elephant O
was O
shot O
before O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
Washington B-MISC
Convention I-MISC
on O
the O
Conservation O
of O
Species O
in O
1975 O
- O
a O
primitive O
confirmation O
of O
the O
purchase O
is O
not O
enough O
- O
the O
object O
is O
confiscated O
and O
comes O
for O
storage O
in O
a O
special O
chamber O
at O
the O
airport O
- O
the O
assertive O
chamber O
. O

The O
awareness O
that O
animal O
smuggling O
is O
punishable O
, O
says O
Felsing B-PER
, O
is O
quite O
present O
in O
the O
population O
today O
. O

That O
travellers O
carry O
the O
turtle O
tank O
on O
a O
rope O
through O
customs O
control O
, O
as O
it O
happened O
ten O
years O
ago O
, O
belongs O
to O
the O
past O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
number O
of O
animal O
smugglers O
has O
not O
declined O
so O
far O
. O
” O

With O
the O
sharp O
increase O
in O
travel O
, O
the O
number O
of O
potential O
perpetrators O
also O
increases O
, O
” O
explains O
Freising O
. O

Customs O
welfare O
officials O
also O
see O
little O
hope O
in O
the O
future O
that O
the O
animal O
smuggling O
could O
completely O
disappear O
: O

The O
Kilo O
Nashorn O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
the O
Kilo O
Gold O
. O

Because O
they O
can O
put O
a O
guard O
behind O
every O
rhinoceros O
, O
and O
that O
does O
n’t O
help O
. O
” O

The O
Doc- O

Honestly O

Lies O
have O
short O
legs O

Might O
be O
. O

But O
does O
the O
truth O
have O
any O
? O

What O
I O
experienced O
in O
a O
Sachsenhäuser B-MISC
pub O
of O
the O
middle O
class O
caused O
me O
to O
doubt O
the O
soundness O
of O
such O
an O
old B-MISC
German I-MISC
proverb O
. O

“ O
He O
gave O
me O
five O
marks O
too O
much O
, O
” O
said O
the O
one O
to O
the O
other O
, O
pointing O
with O
his O
head O
to O
the O
waitress O
. O

His O
companion O
, O
apparently O
a O
moderate O
moralist O
, O
tried O
to O
convince O
him O
to O
return O
the O
five O
- O
mark O
piece O
. O
” O

So O
if O
the O
waitress O
had O
been O
unfriendly O
now O
, O
" O
the O
companion O
argued O
, O
" O
I O
would O
not O
return O
it O
to O
him O
either O
. O
" O

But O
he O
was O
nice O
. O

The O
Zecher O
, O
obviously O
not O
a O
native O
, O
argued O
economically O
. O
” O

At O
the O
prices O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
, O
" O
he O
rebelliously O
said O
, O
" O
five O
marks O
for O
a O
pils O
. O

“ O
. O
” O

Eventually O
, O
he O
convinced O
himself O
and O
said O
: O

“ O
Mr. O
Ober O
, O
you O
gave O
me O
five O
marks O
too O
much O
! O
” O

“ O
Do O
you O
feel O
better O
now O
? O
” O

The O
companion O
asked O
his O
five O
mark O
poorer O
companion O
. O

“ O
No O
, O
” O
he O
replied O
gritty O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
takes O
the O
art O
of O
persuasion O
to O
help O
the O
truth O
jump O

Within O
two O
minutes O
, O
the O

was O
adopted O

The O
case O
is O
clear O

Every O

celebrates O

and O
the O

There O
are O

Therefore O

the O

In O

What O
can O
happen O
if O
something O

, O
many O

experienced O
closely O
, O
when O
immediately O
at O
the O

of O
the O

a O

the O

Then O

gave O

” O
Bernhard B-PER

Only O
one O
remained O
skeptical O
. O

Heinz B-PER
Löffler I-PER
, O
of O
his O

Kerweborsch B-MISC
, O

as O
well O
as O
" O

" O
and O
responsible O
for O
the O
burning O
of O
the O
Kerwelebeth B-MISC

Previously O
, O
visitors O
ended O
the O
" O
Berne B-MISC
Wednesday I-MISC
" O
with O
a O
mourning O
train O
spalier O
, O
which O
moved O
from O
the O
clock O
tower O
up O
to O
the O
church O
school B-ORG
and O
accompanied O
the O
Kerwelebeth B-MISC
on O
their O
final O
journey O
. O

This O
is O
no O
longer O
feasible O
: O

There O
is O
simply O
no O
passage O
in O
that O
crowd O
. O

At O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
burning O
, O
many O
parents O
were O
waiting O
with O
their O
children O
for O
the O
traditional O
spectacle O
. O

Another O
positive O
observation O
: O

To O
Kerb B-MISC
in O
the O
" O
funny O
village O
" O
also O
came O
many O
in O
the O
city O
or O
in O
the O
surrounding O
area O
" O
emigrated O
Bernemer B-MISC
" O
. O

A O
few O
meetings O
were O
well O
planned O
. O

What O
to O
consider O
for O
the O
future O
, O
the O
association O
chairman O
Ochs B-PER
stated O
: O

“ O
The O
train O
route O
could O
be O
shortened O
, O
roads O
are O
empty O
. O
” O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
kerwegesellschaft O
was O
to O
organize O
a O
competition O
for O
better O
decoration O
, O
because O
with O
the O
festive O
jewelry O
it O
was O
not O
well O
ordered O
. O

Even O
the O
ecumenical O
worship O
, O
however O
excellent O
it O
was O
attended O
, O
could O
be O
characterized O
even O
more O
solemnly O
by O
the O
Kerwegesellschaft O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
responsible O
persons O
should O
check O
whether O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
bring O
the O
kerwebaum B-MISC
back O
into O
the O
shelter O
. O

There O
is O
another O
proposal O
from O
OHS B-PER
: O

“ O
Thinking O
about O
a O
child O
’s O
day O
within O
the O
framework O
of O

” O

However O
, O
not O

am O

The O

with O

and O
the O

, O

. O

Even O
as O
a O
crown O
of O
a O
bottleneck O
it O
is O
to O
have O
. O

The O
hasek B-PER
would O
probably O
have O
drunk O
with O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
bottle O
and O
put O
some O
sentences O
in O
the O
mouth O
of O
Schwejk B-PER
so O
sad O
that O
they O
would O
have O
immediately O
taken O
away O
every O
advertising O
value O
from O
him O
in O
their O
immense O
certainty O
of O
encounter O
. O

Now O
Schwejk B-PER
does O
not O
just O
appear O
to O
me O
as O
a O
kitsch O
figure O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
most O
serious O
publications O
of O
the O
most O
reputable O
German B-MISC
publishing O
bodies O
, O
he O
repeatedly O
appears O
in O
order O
to O
illustrate O
the O
customs O
in O
my O
host O
country O
. O

Mostly O
it O
is O
called O
together O
with O
a O
certain O
Mr. O
Kafka B-PER
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
had O
a O
slightly O
different O
worldview O
and O
is O
said O
to O
have O
actually O
lived O
. O

Such O
products O
of O
German B-MISC
intellect O
can O
not O
be O
mistaken O
. O

So O
I O
set O
out O
to O
search O
for O
Kafka B-PER
’s I-PER
Spirit O
and O
the O
Bohemian B-MISC
Swigs B-PER
. O

I O
have O
met O
people O
who O
, O
in O
their O
joy O
of O
opening O
up O
, O
are O
more O
Western O
than O
the O
most O
uncritical O
of O
Westerners O
, O
and O
some O
others O
who O
, O
in O
their O
uncertainty O
, O
already O
follow O
the O
circumstances O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
overcome O
. O

People O
who O
understand O
freedom O
primarily O
the O
fast O
money O
, O
and O
others O
who O
develop O
from O
it O
a O
new O
, O
open O
culture O
based O
on O
grown O
traditions O
. O

Officials O
who O
have O
not O
yet O
noticed O
the O
end O
of O
the O
border O
rule O
, O
and O
officials O
who O
sit O
down O
with O
a O
smile O
over O
the O
regulatory O
mess O
of O
the O
transitional O
acid O
. O

Salesmen O
who O
still O
treat O
the O
customer O
as O
socialist O
applicants O
, O
and O
salesmen O
who O
, O
with O
never O
- O
ending O
kindness O
, O
deceive O
them O
that O
shut O
- O
off O
times O
and O
work O
rests O
on O
Sundays O
are O
foreign O
words O
to O
them O
. O

Taxi O
drivers O
who O
see O
in O
the O
" O
Gypsy O
" O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
evil O
, O
and O
taxi O
drivers O
who O
steadfastly O
refuse O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
industry O
's O
usual O
scam O
on O
the O
customer O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
thought O
from O
a O
distance O
, O
there O
is O
he O
, O
the O
Schwejk B-PER
. O

But O
when O
you O
look O
closer O
, O
he O
always O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
person O
like O
you O
and O
me O
. O

It O
was O
curious O
, O
of O
course O
, O
when O
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
Bohemian B-MISC
Schweiks B-PER
in O
Bausch O
and O
Bogen O
was O
attributed O
equally O
to O
all O
citizens O
of O
the O
CSFR B-ORG
. O

At O
least O
this O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
stopped O
by O
the O
Slovaks B-MISC
with O
their O
barely O
overlooked O
demand O
for O
independence O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O

The O
Adventures O
of O
Structuralism O
on O
the O
difficulties O
of O
historical O
handling O
of O
a O
long O
- O
declared O
theoretical O
model O

A O
controversial O
“ O
form O
” O
of O
scientific O
life O
: O

Structuralism O
is O
obsolete O
. O

Historians O
and O
biographers O
swear O
out O
and O
paint O
their O
grey O
in O
gray O
, O
with O
which O
, O
as O
Hegel B-PER
says O
, O
nothing O
is O
" O
rejuvenated O
" O
anymore O
, O
but O
only O
something O
is O
" O
recognized O
" O
. O

However O
, O
it O
asks O
what O
is O
the O
best O
path O
of O
knowledge O
– O
the O
epic O
of O
structuralism O
or O
the O
history O
of O
the O
structuralists O
. O

Mono- O
and O
biographical O
studies O
have O
since O
followed O
the O
development O
of O
individual O
disciplines O
or O
the O
evolution O
of O
their O
main O
thinkers O
. O

But O
what O
was O
missing O
so O
far O
was O
a O
comprehensive O
history O
of O
this O
movement O
, O
which O
has O
captured O
and O
methodically O
revolutionized O
all O
humanities O
in O
France B-LOC
since O
the O
1950s O
. O

Such O
a O
global O
approach O
, O
however O
, O
faces O
problems O
that O
individual O
studies O
do O
not O
know O
. O

Any O
unified O
, O
continuous O
treatment O
of O
such O
a O
diverse O
phenomenon O
seems O
impossible O
, O
for O
structuralism O
was O
initially O
an O
era O
that O
, O
like O
any O
other O
, O
has O
barely O
precise O
boundaries O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
would O
be O
to O
consider O
whether O
one O
is O
not O
better O
than O
an O
anthropological O
, O
psychoanalytic O
, O
linguistic O
, O
historical O
, O
etc O
. O

Structuralism O
speaks O
of O
structuralism O
. O

What O
also O
connects O
such O
different O
personalities O
as O
Lévi B-PER
- I-PER
Strauss I-PER
, O
Lacan B-PER
, O
Greimas B-PER
, O
Barthes B-PER
, O
Althusser B-PER
, O
Foucault B-PER
or O
Derrida B-PER
, O
whose O
thinking O
also O
falls O
into O
different O
early O
and O
late O
phases O
? O

Were O
they O
structuralists O
at O
all O
, O
who O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
1960s O
distanced O
themselves O
so O
clearly O
from O
this O
label O
? O

In O
his O
wide O
- O
ranging O
Histoire O
du O
structuralisme O
, O
François B-PER
Dosse I-PER
has O
now O
, O
from O
the O
outset O
, O
given O
up O
on O
unity O
or O
mono O

causal O
explanations O
entirely O
in O
favor O
of O
differentiation O
and O
pluralism O

It O
is O
not O
structuralism O
that O
is O
described O
, O
but O
the O
genesis O
of O
the O
" O
structural O
paradigm O
" O
. O

The O
abandonment O
of O
the O
theoretical O
elaboration O
of O
the O
substance O
has O
demanded O
its O
price O
: O

The O
two O
volumes O
, O
together O
well O
1000 O
pages O
, O
offer O
less O
a O
history O
of O
structural O
thinking O
than O
an O
impressive O
panorama O
of O
French B-MISC
thinking O
from O
1945 O
to O
1990 O
. O

The O
difficult O
problem O
of O
periodization O
solves O
Dosse O
by O
dividing O
it O
into O
an O
unstoppable O
ascending O
and O
an O
irreversible O
descending O
phase O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
titled O
the O
two O

with O

homophone O
play O
of O
words O

At O
the O

phase O
are O
the O

This O
section O
culminated O
in O
1966 O
in O
the O
structural O
or O
" O
Light O
Year O
" O
in O
which O
a O
number O

aimed O
at O
putting O
all O

on O
a O
unified O
foundation O
, O
appeared O

. O

Everything O
that O
followed O
after O
this O
periodization O
means O
decline O
, O
dissolution O
, O
or O
extinction O
. O

Now O
, O
such O
different O
phenomena O
as O
generative O
grammar O
, O
deconstructivism O
, O
linguistic O
statements O
theories O
, O
intertextuality O
have O
actually O
thoroughly O
transformed O
the O
structural O
paradigm O
– O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
radical O
criticism O
that O
confronted O
the O
completely O
surprised O
heads O
of O
schools O
in O
May O
68 O
( O
therefore O
, O
according O
to O
Dosse O
, O
one O
should O
look O
for O
a O
“ O
68 O
- O
thinking O
” O
not O
among O
the O
structuralists O
, O
but O
among O
their O

. O

If O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
“ O
death O
of O

” O
was O
really O
proclaimed O
at O
that O
time O
, O
it O
must O
not O
be O
forgotten O
how O
lively O
it O
remained O
just O
after O
May O
68 O
. O

Think O
only O
of O
the O
institutional O
triumph O
in O
the O
reformed O
universities O
, O
of O
the O
prevailing O
position O
that O
the O
“ O
Lacano O

Althusserism O
” O
Maoist B-MISC
tendency O
has O
temporarily O
taken O

or O
of O
Foucault B-PER

ability O
to O
find O
a O
new O
generation O
in O
his O
analysis O
of O
power O

In O

, O
there O
is O
no O

rather O
, O
it O

a O

What O
is O
discussed O
in O
America B-LOC
and O
Germany B-LOC
in O
connection O
with O
Derrida O

concept O
as O
post O

dates O
back O
to O
the O
years O
1963 O

1965 O

in O
which O
the O
oldest O
parts O
of O
The O

created O

This O

avoids O
familiar O

treats O
on O
no O
more O
than O

one O

) O
Side O
, O
what O
he O
calls O
" O
ultra O

structuralism O
" O
- O
for O
him O
an O
ambiguous O
radicalization O
that O
after O
68 O
resulted O
in O
both O
a O
necessary O
" O
adjustment O
" O
of O

its O
" O

If O
such O

can O

The O
author O
had O
to O
develop O
his O
own O
biographical O
concept O
, O
because O
he O
knew O
exactly O
: O

There O
is O
no O
“ O
normal O
” O
biography O
about O
this O
mysterious O
and O
fascinating O
figure O
, O
about O
this O
unique O
“ O
case O
” O
in O
modern O
spiritual O
history O
. O

Too O
many O
things O
come O
together O
here O
. O

Althusser B-PER
was O
apparently O
a O
man O
without O
qualities O
, O
but O
he O
was O
able O
to O
rise O
to O
an O
intellectual O
myth O
as O
a O
professor O
of O
philosophy O
and O
as O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Communist O
Party O
. O

But O
he O
was O
also O
a O
mental O
sick O
whose O
life O
ended O
in O
a O
tragedy O
. O

His O
biographer O
sees O
his O
task O
in O
confronting O
this O
myth O
with O
the O
biographical O
reality O
in O
order O
to O
destroy O
it O
. O

Through O
a O
variety O
of O
new O
sources O
, O
he O
cautiously O
tries O
to O
penetrate O
the O
imaginary O
world O
of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
killed O
his O
wife O
. O

On O
500 O
pages O
, O
he O
measures O
through O
the O
time O
when O
Althusser B-PER
was O
still O
completely O
unknown O
and O
in O
which O
the O
key O
to O
understanding O
the O
puzzle O
must O
lie O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Algerian B-MISC
childhood O
, O
who O
has O
been O
thoroughly O
poisoned O
by O
a O
physically O
hostile O
mother O
( O
and O
" O

" O
) O
: O

In O

the O

of O
her O
husband O
, O
who O
had O
fallen O
in O
the O

she O
was O
supposed O
to O

Thus O

This O

dialectically O

correctly O
called O

that O

successful O
, O
six O

Instead O
, O
an O

Neumann B-PER
called O
on O
the O
German B-ORG
government I-ORG
to O
strengthen O
its O
support O
for O

. O

The O

Neumann B-PER
rejected O
expanding O

the O
20 O

He O
criticized O

The O
“ O

” O
of O
ARD B-ORG

is O
being O
neglected O
, O
Neumann B-PER
said O

Also O
, O
the O

” O
, O
the O
CDU B-MISC

" O
. O

In O

" O
Without O

we O

the O

Not O
many O
countries O

The O

eventually O

Schewardnadse B-PER

did O
not O
support O

“ O

With O

So O

, O
only O

been O
successful O
. O

His O

failed O
. O

Even O
before O
the O
events O
in O
Abkhazia B-LOC
, O
Shevardnadze B-PER
had O
published O
a O
manifesto O
on O
August O

included O
the O
lifting O

the O
release O

all O

. O

Well O

that O
Schewardnadse B-PER

put O
his O
political O
existence O
at O
risk O
for O
the O
Manifesto O
, O
threatening O
with O
resignation O

It O
was O
only O
after O
a O
tough O
debate O
with O
his O
deputy O
Djaba B-PER
Iosselani I-PER

the O

that O
he O
was O
able O
to O

it O

Whether O
all O

were O
released O

is O
unclear O

skeptical O
: O

" O
The O
State O

decision O
on O
the O

It O
seems O
that O

already O
inferior O
to O

Djaba B-PER
Iosselani I-PER

who O
is O
accused O
of O
spending O
a O
total O

What O

When O

old O
mass B-MISC
housewife I-MISC
recently O
educated O
her O
11 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
daughter O
, O
she O
fell O
from O
all O
the O

. O

Because O
what O
is O
left O
of O
the O
once O
modern O
school O
building O
after O
about O
30 O
years O
, O
the O

now O
call O
themselves O
decaying O
, O
but O
realistically O
as O
a O

Mould O
in O

and O
- O
for O
the O
37 O

year O
- O
old O
probably O
the O
most O
impressive O
: O

In O
the O

still O
the O
same O
pollution O
on O
the O

that O
she O
herself O
had O
noticed O
about O

From O

the O
quite O

Father O

Keindl I-PER
turns O
his O
face O
to O
a O
smile O

adds O
: O

“ O
I O

Father O
Gottfried B-PER
is O
Landespolizeidekan O
of O
Hessen B-LOC

It O
all O
began O
after O
the O
death O
of O
the O
two O
police O
officers O
at O
the O
West B-LOC
railway I-LOC
in O
November O
1987 O
. O
" O
At O
that O
time O
a O
discussion O
arose O
between O
committed O
police O
officers O
, O
their O
superiors O
and O
the O
church O
, O
" O
recalls O
the O
provincial O
of O
the O
German B-ORG
Order I-ORG
in O
Sachsenhausen B-LOC
. O

Many O
police O
officers O
felt O
left O
alone O
with O
their O
occupational O
problems O
and O
open O
questions O
. O

Finally O
, O
they O
approached O
the O
order O
with O
the O
request O
for O
a O
pastoral O
guardian O
. O

“ O
Then O
a O
strange O
symbiosis O
began O
, O
” O
says O
Keindl B-PER
. O

A O
year O
and O
a O
half O
of O
layered O
service O
across O
the O
Hessic B-MISC
police O
hierarchy O
, O
starting O
in O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC

, O
with O
criminal O
police O
and O
special O
commandos O
, O
to O

- O
" O
I O
was O
involved O
in O
everything O
and O
became O
more O
and O
more O
an O
insider O
" O
. O

Knowing O
exactly O
what O
’s O
going O
on O
with O
a O
bet O
was O
the O
motto O
. O
” O

No O
one O
can O
understand O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
plant O
if O
you O
do O
not O
absorb O
the O
environment O
within O
you O
, O
” O
says O
the O
Father O
. O

Often O
it O
had O
been O
the O
dimensions O
he O
had O
n’t O
known O
so O
far O

There O
were O

” O
he O
confesses O
, O
“ O
that O

There O
was O
only O

” O

When O
Father O
Gottfried B-PER
tells O
of O
the O
“ O
scene O
” O
, O
of O
the O
experiences O
he O
calls O
human O
boundary O
experiences O
, O
then O
his O
words O
are O
direct O
and O
do O
not O
embellish O
anything O
. O
” O

Sometimes O
it O
’s O
a O
shit O
job O
, O
” O
he O
says O
, O
recalling O
the O
picture O
of O
the O
young O

who O
was O

naked O

” O

“ O
My O

” O
Keindl B-PER
almost O
apologizes O
. O

Emotionally O
, O
you O
also O
get O
stuck O
with O

” O

Often O

nothing O

what O
I O
preached O
from O

Hence O
his O
demand O
: O

No O

work O
in O
this O

for O
too O
long O
. O
” O

has O

the O

It O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
for O

“ O

It O

No O

” O

Talking O

more O
likely O
in O

This O
long O
taboo O
question O
is O
currently O
being O
discussed O
in O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
after O
an O
expert O
group O
of O
the O
“ O
Association B-ORG

” O
( O
Newborn O
Diseases O
) O
concluded O
in O
an O
opinion O
that O
“ O
active O
termination O
of O
life O
” O
could O
be O
acceptable O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
. O

A O
pediatrician O
, O
explained O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
group O
, O
Cornelius B-PER
Versluys I-PER
, O
who O
ended O
the O

acted O
reasonably O
to O
indicate O
in O

not O
report O
the O

This O
may O
be O
unjustifiable O
from O
a O
legal O
point O
of O
view O

but O
from O
a O
moral O
point O
of O
view O
it O
may O
in O
some O
cases O
be O
to O
be O
held O
accountable O
. O

According O
to O
reports O
from O
Versluys B-PER
, O
pediatricians O
are O
divided O
on O
whether O
killing O
a O
very O
seriously O
injured O
newborn O
is O
permissible O
. O

In O
the O
report O
“ O
Do B-MISC

? O
” O

There O
are O
recommendations O
on O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
these O
differences O
. O

Every O
year O
, O
according O
to O
the O
group O
, O
about O
300 O
newborns O
die O
in O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
because O
the O
doctor O
does O
n’t O
start O
a O
medical O
treatment O
at O
all O
or O
discontinues O
the O

. O

Versluys B-PER
estimates O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
of O
active O
termination O
of O
life O
in O
newborns O
to O
no O
more O
than O
ten O
per O
year O
. O

The O
recommendations O
say O
parents O
should O
be O
able O
to O
find O
help O
for O
their O
child O
from O
a O
doctor O
who O
has O
an O
understanding O
of O
their O
life O
view O
. O

The O
doctor O
and O
parents O
should O
agree O
on O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
child O
. O

In O
one O
case O
, O
this O
could O
mean O
death O
aid O
, O
but O
in O
the O
other O
case O
not O
. O

If O
a O
doctor O
is O
unwilling O
to O
end O
the O
child O
’s O
life O
while O
the O
parents O
desire O
it O
, O
he O
must O
ensure O
that O
the O
parents O
find O
the O
way O
to O
another O
physician O
that O
fulfils O
their O
wish O
. O

The O
newborns O
referred O
to O
in O
the O
recommendations O
are O
babies O
who O
are O
not O
older O
than O
four O
weeks O
and O
need O
lifelong O
care O
. O

These O
included O
, O
for O
example O
, O
children O
with O
an O
open O
back O
, O
with O
paralysis O
of O
the O
bladder O
, O
with O
severe O
brain O
injury O
, O
for O
whom O
there O
was O
no O
prospect O
of O
an O
adequate O
quality O
of O
life O
. O

Versluys B-PER
personally O
considers O
it O
acceptable O
to O
actively O
end O
the O
lives O
of O
such O
babies O
if O
the O
parents O
also O
desired O
it O
. O

The O
report O
of O
the O
group O
of O
specialists O
sets O
out O
criteria O
that O
are O
considered O
determining O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
: O

Can O
the O
child O
think O
and O
communicate O
? O

Can O
it O
take O
some O
care O
of O
itself O
, O
can O
it O
be O
taken O
care O
of O
at O
home O
, O
or O
is O
it O
dependent O
on O
medical O
care O
for O
a O
lifetime O
? O

Will O
it O
suffer O
deeply O
? O

and O
: O

How O
long O
will O
it O
live O
? O

Versluys B-PER
advocates O
that O
the O
pediatrician O
, O
who O
has O
actively O
ended O
the O
life O
of O
a O
seriously O
injured O

, O
report O
this O
to O

However O
, O
he O
regrets O
that O
there O
are O
no O
legal O
rules O
for O
the O
cases O
in O
which O
the O

considers O
and O
accepts O
active O
termination O

as O
an O
emergency O
. O

The O
Working O
Group O
considers O
that O
under O
the O
given O
circumstances O
, O
the O
doctor O
himself O
must O
consider O
whether O
he O
considers O
it O
appropriate O
to O
inform O
the O
public O
prosecutor O
of O
his O
actions O
or O
not O
. O

A O
judicial O
examination O
, O
it O
is O
said O
, O
could O
cause O

1992 O
is O
no O

. O

If O
the O
Bundesgerichtshof O
would O
decide O
differently O
than O
the O
Berlin B-ORG
Chamber I-ORG

, O
then O
the O
whole O

would O
have O
to O
doubt O
itself O

Many O

think O
that O
then O
our O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
that O
suddenly O
not O
Ossietzky B-PER

the O

it O
? O

Could O
this O

the O
German B-MISC
justice O
will O
not O
change O

the O

Ossietzky B-PER

the O
decision O

If O

why O
should O
it O

how O

( O
FR B-ORG
of O

" O
Threatening O

) O
. O

The O
German B-MISC
press O
has O
so O
far O
mainly O
about O
the O
enclosed O
cities O
of O
Sarajevo B-LOC
and O
Gorazde B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
not O
visible O
how O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
people O
in O
these O
cities O
could O
be O
improved O
by O
armed O
convoys O
of O
aid O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
everything O
possible O
must O
be O
done O
to O
save O
the O
lives O
of O
the O
defenseless O
, O
i.e. O
women O
, O
children O
, O
the O
elderly O
, O
the O
wounded O
. O

It O
makes O
no O
sense O
to O
bring O
food O
to O
these O
people O
, O
and O
then O
leave O
them O
in O
the O
hail O
of O
the O
shells O
, O
while O
you O
go O
back O
to O
the O
safe O
shelter O
yourself O
. O

How O
should O
such O
an O
action O
be O
carried O
out O
? O

For O
example O
, O
a O
convoy O
of O
aid O
is O
approaching O
the O
city O
of O
Gorazde B-LOC
, O
where O
it O
is O
exposed O
to O
a O
fierce O
artillery O
fire O
. O

Should O
the O
siegeurs O
stop O
the O
fire O
until O
the O
food O
is O
delivered O
, O
or O
should O
the O
convoy O
wait O
until O
the O
gunfire O
ends O
at O
some O
point O
? O

Both O
seem O
unrealistic O
. O

There O
is O
only O
one O
way O
to O
provide O
humanitarian O
aid O
. O

All O
entitled O
persons O
must O
be O
allowed O
free O
withdrawal O
to O
a O
safe O
place O
. O

Everything O
else O
is O
no O
help O
. O

However O
, O
the O
question O
arises O
whether O
the O
Bosnians B-MISC
want O
the O
free O
withdrawal O
of O
women O
and O
children O
at O
all O
. O

They O
may O
reject O
it O
because O
it O
could O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
renunciation O
to O
the O
land O
they O
claim O
. O

It O
would O
be O
grateful O
if O
you O
about O
it O
. O

The O
Bosnians B-MISC
will O
also O
wonder O
who O
feeds O
the O
soldiers O
when O

The O

probably O
even O

the O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
expect O
the O

We O

There O

A O

lead O

Some O
notable O

that O
need O

The O

Since O

the O
principle O
of O

divorces O
are O
comparable O
to O
the O
decisions O
of O
a O
football O
referee O
who O
has O
not O
seen O
the O
game O
but O
still O
decides O
on O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
game O
. O

This O
then O
times O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
catastrophic O
consequences O
, O
because O
who O
without O
his O
own O
fault O
, O
just O
because O
he O
is O
the O
" O
economically O
stronger O

over O
the O

for O
the O

who O
flips O

In O
order O
to O
relieve O
lawmakers O
and O
the O
family O
judiciary O
of O
responsibility O
for O
these O
consequences O
, O
mediators O
should O
now O
hold O
back O
. O

However O
, O
if O
before O
, O
even O
before O
a O
parent O
couple O
seeks O
help O
with O
a O
mediator O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
children O
remain O
with O
the O

regardless O
of O
the O

the O
self O

also O
post O

marital O
maintenance O
to O
a O
possibly O
only O
on O
the O
ego O
- O
trip O
ex O

, O
then O
the O
use O
of O
mediators O
is O
just O
nothing O
but O
a O
shift O
of O
responsibility O
from O
the O
family O
court O
to O
the O
mediator O
. O

The O
mediation O
then O
aims O
nothing O
more O
than O
to O
accommodate O
the O
“ O
economically O
stronger O
” O
, O
to O
accept O
the O
often O
ruinous O
consequences O
of O
divorce O
without O
resistance O
and O
thus O
to O
take O
the O
family O
court O
the O
already O
pre O

established O
decision O
on O
custody O
and O
maintenance O
payment O
“ O
consensual O
” O
. O

But O
if O
a O
judicial O
decision O
is O
already O
determined O
in O
advance O
, O
then O
this O
is O
probably O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
farce O
and O
only O
comparable O
with O
the O
already O
established O

of O

of O

former B-LOC

in O

Why O
, O
since O
the O
feminist O
legal O
magazine O
with O
the O
descriptive O
name O
“ O
dispute O
” O
sees O
dangers O
in O
mediation O
, O
is O
incomprehensible O
, O
because O
even O
in O
mediation O
everything O
is O
obviously O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
woman O
. O

It O
is O
also O
incomprehensible O
how O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
such O
a O
situation O
, O
Ms O
Häsing B-PER
- I-PER
Levend I-PER
can O
put O
the O
" O
difference O
in O
power O
between O
men O
and O
women O
in O
our O
society O
" O
into O
play O
and O
assert O
that O
women O
come O
with O
the O
worse O
cards O
to O
the O
counseling O
stations O
and O
to O
the O

table O
of O
the O

. O

If O
( O
as O
she O
writes O
herself O
) O
it O
is O
clear O
before O
visiting O
a O
mediator O
who O
the O
children O
stay O
with O
and O
who O
has O
to O
pay O
subsistence O
to O
the O
ex O

husband O
after O

, O
then O
you O
know O
in O
what O
direction O
the O
" O
divide O
of O
power O
" O
in O
the O
case O
of O
divorce O
. O

The O
dispute O
, O
which O
is O
often O
years O
of O
conflict O
, O
which O
is O
triggered O
by O
divorce O
and O
is O
the O
most O
burdensome O
for O
the O
children O
, O
can O
only O
be O
avoided O
if O
the O
legislator O
finally O
recalls O
Article O
6 O
( O
4 O
) O
of O
our O
Basic O
Law O
, O
which O
states O
that O
every O
mother O
is O
entitled O
to O
the O
protection O
and O
care O
of O
the O

. O

Those O
who O
believe O
they O
can O
end O
the O
often O
bloody O
divorce O
struggles O
by O
using O
mediators O
are O
on O
the O
wooden O
path O
. O

These O
struggles O
can O
only O
be O
stopped O
or O
at O
least O
reduced O
to O
a O
minimum O
if O
the O
community O
( O
i.e. O
, O
the O

) O
takes O
over O
the O
post O

marital O
maintenance O
of O
the O
woman O
, O
at O

in O
the O
cases O
in O
which O
she O

that O
Mr. O

Finally O

with O

Finally O
, O
we O
should O
be O
consistent O
and O
not O
stop O
at O

the O
best O
of O

Until O

Since O

all O

. O

It O
found O
a O
mixed O
resonance O
in O

however O
, O
because O
it O
contains O
many O
political O
considerations O

Thus O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
assume O
that O
the O

the O

In O
contrast O

the O

found O

too O
slow O

Half O
the O
original O

Even O
a O
search O
run O
with O
only O
one O

( O
at O
Sanyo B-ORG

is O
a O
bit O

In O
general O
, O
halving O
the O

speed O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
tape O
saving O
is O
considered O
problematic O
as O
it O
reduces O

In O
the O
case O
of O
S B-MISC

and O

, O
however O
, O
the O

relatively O
low O

Given O
the O
comparatively O
expensive O

for O
these O

, O
the O

looking O

The O
22 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Vladimir B-PER
had O
volunteered O
to O
join O
the O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
military O
in O
early O
April O
to O
" O
defend O
his O
homeland O
" O
in O
the O
territory O
fought O
by O
Armenians B-MISC
and O
Azerbaijanis B-MISC
in O
Nagorno B-LOC
- I-LOC
Karabakh I-LOC
, O
as O
the O
father O
says O
. O

When O
the O
friends O
volunteered O
, O
he O
could O
not O
stand O
as O
a O
coward O
. O

The O
Alimovs B-PER
are O
actually O
Russians B-MISC
, O
but O
they O
have O
lived O
and O
worked O
in O
the O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
capital O
Baku B-LOC
for O
decades O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
May O
, O
Alimov B-PER
had O
learned O
from O
the O
International B-ORG
Red I-ORG
Cross I-ORG
that O
his O
son O
had O
been O
taken O
prisoner O
of O
war O
by O
Armenians B-MISC
two O
weeks O
earlier O

Since O
this O

arrived O

been O
looking O

him O

Neither O
in O
the O
Ministry B-ORG

in O
the O
Ministry O

does O
anyone O
feel O
responsible O

” O

No O
one O
keeps O
lists O
, O
counts O
the O
wounded O
and O
the O
dead O
, O
” O
the O
father O
complains O
. O

But O
the O
53 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
driver O
did O
not O
give O
up O
. O

He O
packed O
up O
his O
savings O
, O
left O
his O
workplace O
and O
began O
to O
disembark O
the O
battalions O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
border O
. O
” O

I O
learned O
a O
lot O
more O
about O
the O
troops O
. O
” O

There O
were O
lists O
of O
dead O
and O
wounded O
. O
” O

I O
counted O
a O
total O
of O
1,700 O
soldiers O
and O
5,000 O
civilians O
on O
the O
lists O
during O
my O
trip O
, O
” O
says O
Alimow B-PER
. O

However O
, O
these O
are O
only O
the O
numbers O
of O
Azerbaijanis B-MISC
who O
fell O
into O
Armenian B-MISC
captivity O
. O

Thanks O
to O
his O
tenacity O
, O
Alimov B-PER
eventually O
achieved O
in O
the O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
border O
town O
of O
Kasakh B-LOC
that O
his O
son O
was O
planned O
to O
participate O
in O
a O
prison O
exchange O
. O

Together O
with O
four O
Azerbaijanis B-MISC
and O
a O
woman O
, O
he O
was O
to O
be O
exchanged O
for O
an O
Armenian B-MISC
officer O
. O

But O
it O
did O
not O
work O
. O

As O
Alimov B-PER
found O
out O
, O
the O
Armenian B-MISC
officer O
is O
with O
an O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
family O
who O
holds O
him O
captive O
to O
organize O
an O
exchange O
against O
his O
own O
son O
in O
Armenia B-LOC
. O

As O
this O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
is O
held O
by O
an O
Armenian B-MISC
family O
seeking O
to O
free O
their O
own O
son O
from O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
captivity O
, O
the O
company O
failed O
. O

" O
Our O
governments O
are O
too O
young O
to O
have O
everything O
under O
control O
, O
" O
explains O
Vladimir B-PER
Airapetjan I-PER
, O
the O
head O
of O
the B-MISC
KGB I-MISC
in O
the O
Armenian B-MISC
border O
town O
of O
Idschewan B-LOC
, O
dealing O
with O
prisoners O
of O

on O
both O
sides O
. O

There O
were O
no O
agreements O
between O
the O
governments O
of O
Armenia B-LOC
and O
Azerbaijan B-LOC
. O

The O
prison O
exchange O
is O
not O
at O
the O
government O
level O
, O
but O
at O
the O
local O
level O
. O
” O

Thus O
, O
the O
neighboring O
communities O
, O
the O
Armenian B-MISC
Ijewan B-LOC
and O
Kazakh B-LOC
on O
the O
Azerbaijani B-MISC

, O
haveined O
a O
relatively O
good O

despite O
the O

Villagers O
on O
both O

still O
borrow O

There O
is O
also O
an O
exchange O
of O
prisoners O
between O
Kazakhstan B-LOC

Idzhevan B-LOC

That O
it O
can O
work O
here O
, O
has O
soon O
been O
talked O
about O
, O
says O
the O
head B-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC

so O
now O
a O
growing O
number O
of O

turned O
here O

" O

The O

come O
to O
me O

give O
the O

I O
try O

find O
out O

” O

The O
KGB B-MISC

confirms O
Alimov B-PER

accusations O
that O
more O
and O
more O

are O

reliantly O
taking O

then O
exchanging O
them O

” O

These O
criminal O
acts O
are O
tolerated O
by O

, O
” O
he O
said O

In O
many O
cases O
, O
lucrative O
business O
would O
also O
be O
done O
with O

" O
I O

" O
says O
Airapetjan B-PER

When O
Leningrad B-LOC
was O
renamed O
to O
the O
old O
name O
of O
St. B-LOC
Petersburg I-LOC
, O
one O
wondered O
why O
not O
the O
name O
Kirov B-LOC
caused O
by O
the O
revolution O
of O
1917 O
was O
also O
changed O
to O
Marinsky B-LOC
( O
= O
MarienTheater B-LOC

. O

Also O
musically O
, O
the O
recording O
seeks O
to O
compromise O
between O
incompatible O
positions O
and O
finds O
its O
own O
way O

But O
she O
does O
not O
follow O
it O
in O
some O
details O
. O

That O
had O
already O
been O
the O
case O
in O
Claudio B-PER
Abbado I-PER
's I-PER
Viennese B-MISC
State I-MISC
Opera O

, O
where O
the O
final O
collapse O

had O
passed O
into O
Strawinsky B-PER

In O
fact O
, O
the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
ideologically O
open O
and O
in O
the O
best O
sense O
epic O
work O
is O
delicate O
. O

Schostakovich B-PER
had O
attempted O
to O
round O
out O
the O
sketches O
he O
had O
passed O
on O
by O
following O
the O
fire O
- O
death O
with O
the O
wonderful O
morning O

at O
Moscow B-LOC

: O

A O
harmonization O
by O
Zyklik O
, O
which O
contradicts O
Mussorgsky B-PER
’s O
picture O
of O
history O
. O

Gergiew B-PER
now O
goes O
a O
different O
path O
than O
Abbado B-PER
with O
Strawinsky B-PER
's I-PER
Fire B-MISC
Wizardry I-MISC
by O
following O
the O
final O
choir O
of O
the O
ancient O
believers O
with O
a O
purely O
instrumental O
reprise O
: O

It O
is O
a O
compelling O
solution O
, O
as O
in O
other O
detail O
problems O
. O

Also O
musically O
, O
Gergiew B-PER
goes O
his O
own O
way O
. O

He O
interprets O
the O
music O
more O
introverted O
than O
Abbado B-PER
( O
whose O
abbreviations O
he O
avoids O
) O
, O
turns O
the O
musical O
epic O
into O
a O
often O
chamber O
musical O
style O
. O

He O
can O
afford O
to O
give O
up O
any O
theatralik O
because O
his O
choirs O
impress O
with O
a O
fantastic O
fine O
articulation O
. O

Even O
the O
soloist O
ensemble O
, O
giving O
up O
on O
every O
borrowed O
star B-PER
, O
is O
convinced O
by O
the O
subtlety O
of O
his O
access O
. O

The O
absence O
of O
spectacular O
effects O
can O
also O
be O
observed O
in O
the O
sound O
technique O
of O
the O
recording O
created O
in O
the O
bitterest O
winter O
cold O
of O
1991 O
. O

Everything O
, O
even O
with O
a O
properly O
turned O
volume O
controller O
, O
seems O
quiet O
, O
some O
things O
are O
also O
significantly O
removed O
. O

It O
seems O
like O
Gergiew B-PER
wants O
to O
show O
us O
an O
evil O
story O
from O
ancient O
times O
as O
a O
musical O
backglass O
painting O
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
whole O
truth O
of O
Mussorgski B-PER

but O
as O
an O
independent O
interpretation O
is O
of O

An O
important O
event O
is O
usually O
overlooked O
, O
with O
which O
hatred O

misery O
in O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
began O
: O

The O
assassination O
of O
King O
Alexander B-PER
in O
Marseille B-LOC
in O
1934 O
during O
his O
state O
visit O
to O

was O
committed O
by O
fascist O
Croats B-MISC
who O
were O
trained O
in O
Italy B-LOC

supported O
by O

The O
assassination O
was O
a O
response O
to O
the O
( O

author O
) O
1929 O
renaming O

. O

It O
is O
also O
overlooked O
that O
this O
renaming O
was O
in O
turn O
a O
reaction O
to O
the O
murder O
of O
the O
Croatian B-MISC
opposition O
leader O

Finally O
, O
the O

Twenty O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
Italian B-MISC
Salesian O
Father O
Xavier B-PER

Nicoló I-PER
had O
founded O
this O

who O

“ O

old O
Carlos B-PER
Lara I-PER
, O
an O
educational O
associate O
at O
“ O
Bosconia B-MISC
” O
, O
adding O
: O

" O
This O
should O
take O
into O
account O
the O
positive O
qualities O
of O
children O
, O
such O
as O
their O
ability O
to O
work O
together O
and O
their O
group O
solidarity O
, O
which O
they O
have O
learned O
on O
the O
street O
. O
" O

Carlos B-PER
has O
once O
experienced O
the O
four O
stages O
of O
the O
project O
, O
the O
last O
of O
which O
is O
the O
Children O
's O
Republic O
. O

The O
first O
stage O
is O
called O
friendship O
. O

Father O
Nicoló B-PER
and O
his O
colleagues O
go O
to O
the O
children O
, O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
called O
gamines O
, O
on O
the O
street O
to O
make O
friends O
with O
them O
. O

So O
the O
program O
is O
adapted O
to O
the O
world O
of O
street O
children O
and O
not O
vice O
versa O
. O

First O
watch O
the O
children O
. O

After O
the O
first O
contacts O
, O
they O
finally O
begin O
to O
play O
with O
each O
other O
. O

For O
this O
, O
the O
educators O
of O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
have O
learned O
the O
language O
of O
the O
" O
gamines O
" O
who O
speak O
these O
to O
be O
able O
to O
better O
protect O
themselves O
against O
others O
on O
the O
street O
. O

After O
that O
, O
they O
invite O
the O
children O
to O
an O
excursion O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
, O
south O
of O
Bogotá B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
children O
rest O
while O
swimming O
and O
playing O
and O
live O
without O
drugs O
for O
a O
while O
. O

About O
90 O
percent O
of O
the O
approximately O
5,000 O
street O
children O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
use O
drugs O
. O

Many O
snuffle O
shoe O
glue O
that O
they O
use O
to O
stifle O
their O
nerves O
and O
hunger O
. O

But O
increasingly O
, O
" O
basuco O
" O
is O
also O
taken O
, O
a O
dangerous O
mixture O
from O
the O
waste O
product O
of O
the O
cocoa O
plant O
, O
which O
is O
enriched O
with O
chemical O
additives O
. O

The O
trip O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
offers O
the O
staff O
of O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
the O
opportunity O
to O
get O
to O
know O
the O
backgrounds O
of O
the O
street O
life O
of O
the O
children O
. O

All O
project O
managers O
agree O
that O
, O
like O
many O
other O
problems O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
, O
the O
gamines O
have O
their O
primary O
cause O
in O
the O
social O
distress O
of O
many O
families O
. O

According O
to O
information O
from O
the O
State O
Statistics B-ORG
Office I-ORG
of O
1990 O
, O
38 O
percent O
of O
all O
Colombian B-MISC
households O
did O
not O
have O
sufficient O
income O
to O
support O
them O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
families O
have O
fled O
the O
country O
to O
the O
city O
. O

There O
people O
are O
driven O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
educational O
prospects O
as O
well O
as O
the O
lack O
of O
medical O
care O
in O
rural O
areas O
, O
but O
also O
the O
lack O
of O
their O
own O
land O
and O
wages O
from O
which O
they O
can O
live O
, O
but O
above O
all O
also O
the O
ongoing O
“ O
violence O
” O
( O
violence O
) O
that O
still O
prevails O
there O
: O

Although O
the O
attacks O
of O
the O
drug O

have O
decreased O
since O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
military O
arms O
of O

last O
year O
, O
however O
, O
the O
aggression O
between O
the O
military O
and O
the O
rebels O
are O
now O
rising O
again O
after O
unsuccessful O
negotiations O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
guerrilla O
. O

Many O
civilians O
are O
involved O
. O

In O
the O
city O
, O
however O
, O
the O
refugee O
families O
often O
find O
no O
work O
or O
only O
an O
employment O
in O
the O
" O
informal O
sector O
" O
, O
so O
are O
without O
a O
regular O
income O
. O

In O
Bogotá B-LOC
, O
more O
than O
440,000 O
workers O
, O
about O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
working O
population O
, O
earn O
less O
than O
the O
already O
very O
low O
minimum O
wage O
, O
according O
to O
the O
government O

economic O
data O

Often O
both O
parents O
have O
to O
work O

The O
children O
either O
stay O
alone O
at O
home O
or O
walk O
out O
on O
the O
street O
where O
they O
contribute O
their O
own O
portion O
to O
family O
income O
by O
occasional O
work O
, O
begging O
or O
stealing O
. O

Often O
they O
then O
join O
the O
street O
children O
and O
break O
the O
contact O
with O
the O
family O
because O
they O
feel O
exploited O
there O
and O
are O
often O
abused O
. O
” O

85 O
percent O
of O

punish O

explains O
Manuel B-PER
Ospina I-PER
, O
responsible O
employee O
at O
“ O
Bosconia B-MISC
” O
for O
the O
street O
boys O
, O
who O
blames O
for O
this O
behavior O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
social O
distress O
that O
leads O
to O
frustration O
and O
aggressiveness O
of O
the O
fathers O
, O
also O
an O
authoritarian O
educational O
style O
that O
has O
its O
roots O
in O
the O
long O
history O
of O

About O
three O
- O
quarters O
of O
the O
street O
children O
who O
take O
part O
in O
the O
trip O
to O
Arvelaez O
then O
come O
regularly O
to O
the O
“ O
patio O
” O
, O
a O
yard O
that O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
set O
up O
twelve O
years O
ago O
for O
the O
street O
boys O
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
gate O
of O
the O
farm O
, O
the O
gamines O
give O
away O
their O
drugs O
and O
then O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
. O

They O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
wash O
themselves O
, O
play O
football O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
get O
treated O
. O
” O

For O
eight O
days O
I O
’ve O
come O
to O
the O
‘ O
patio O
’ O
because O
there O
’s O
breakfast O
and O
lunch O
here O
, O
” O
says O
the O
13 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Julian B-PER
. O

He O
also O
became O
a O
street O
boy O
because O
he O
was O
beaten O
by O
his O
parents O
in O
the O
poor O
neighborhood O
of O
Santa B-LOC
Librada I-LOC
in O
the O
south O
of O
Bogotá B-LOC
. O

But O
like O
many O
others O
, O
Julian B-PER
goes O
back O
to O
the O
streets O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
“ O
gamines O
” O
have O
become O
accustomed O
to O
the O
“ O
free O
life O
” O
there O
. O

This O
will O
for O
freedom O
is O
respected O
by O
the O
staff O
of O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
, O
because O
in O
the O
open O
institution O
one O
wants O
to O
take O
the O
dignity O
of O
children O
seriously O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
second O
phase O
of O
the O
program O
- O
whose O
name O
" O
freedom O
" O
already O
indicates O
- O
the O
children O
can O
go O
away O
again O
. O

But O
here O
they O
have O
to O
adhere O
to O
very O
certain O
rules O
, O
for O
example O
, O
to O
eat O
and O
sleep O
and O
have O
conversations O
with O
the O
responsible O
. O

Like O
the O
employees O
of O
the O
project O
in O
the O
first O
approximation O
efforts O
with O
the O
children O
on O
the O
street O
, O
here O
, O
too O
, O
one O
tries O
first O
to O
attribute O
the O
children O
to O
their O
families O
. O

Because O
" O
the O
best O
institution O
is O
the O
true O
family O
" O
, O
Carlos B-PER
Lara I-PER
and O
Manuel B-PER
Ospina I-PER
are O
convinced O
of O
this O
. O

However O
, O
they O
experience O
that O
the O
children O
usually O
only O
return O
there O
for O
a O
short O
time O
, O
then O
they O
come O
back O
to O
the O
" O
patio O
" O
. O

They O
start O
again O
from O
the O
beginning O
, O
what O
those O
who O
once O
got O
out O
have O
to O
do O
for O
educational O
reasons O
. O

three O
times O

really O
knows O
it O
, O
" O
Carlos B-PER
points O
out O
once O
again O
that O
the O
" O
gamines O
" O
have O
learned O
to O
cherish O
freedom O
on O
the O
street O
. O

In O
the O
third O
stage O
, O
called O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
, O
the O
children O
then O
finally O
draw O
a O
conclusion O
under O
their O
past O
. O

As O
a O
symbolic O
gesture O
for O
this O
, O
they O
solemnly O
burn O
their O
clothes O
. O

Father O
Nicoló B-PER
sees O
this O
stage O
as O
a O
playful O
introduction O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
. O

Now O
the O
children O
regularly O
go O
to O
school O
and O
learn O
craftsmanship O
activities O
in O
a O
workshop O
and O
in O
ceramic O
classes O
. O

When O
the O
caregivers O
finally O
gain O
the O
impression O
that O
a O
child O
has O
become O
more O
mature O
, O
it O
moves O
to O
the O
children O

where O
currently O
355 O

where O
most O

“ O

” O
is O
located O
in O
a O
quiet O
, O
green O
countryside O
outside O
the O
city O
. O

The O
environment O
contributes O
to O
education O
. O

Unlike O
the O
hectic O
life O
in O
the O
dirty O
city O

, O
you O
can O
quietly O
prepare O
for O
a O
career O
here O

In O

the O

" O
Manuel B-PER

explains O
the O
fact O
that O

However O
, O
most O
of O
the O
former O

have O
finally O
left O
the O

Many O
take O

a O
technical O

, O
others O
even O
continue O
to O
study O
at O
the O

Until O

in O

no O

had O
taken O

However O
, O
a O

Some O
younger O

had O
the O
same O
social O

family O
problems O
as O
the O

, O
but O
there O
are O
also O
many O

who O
have O
been O
abused O
by O
their O
Macho O
men O
or O
who O
have O
been O
acting O
as O
prostitutes O
because O
of O
their O
social O
distress O

According O
to O
official O
data O
, O
there O
are O
currently O
14,000 O

Some O

, O
IG B-ORG

Now O
that O

the O

has O
to O
move O

the O

Month O
after O
month O
, O
the O
Nibelungenplatz B-LOC
receives O
265,000 O

, O
the O

is O
claiming O
3.6 O

The O
basis O
for O
the O
conclusion O
of O

was O
also O
the O

on O
the O

Meanwhile O
, O
it O
became O
known O
that O
IG B-ORG

already O
had O
completely O
different O

with O
this O
area O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O

it O
will O
be O
passed O
on O
to O

However O
, O
since O
this O
land O

was O
in O

at O

Krawinkel B-PER
wants O
to O
make O
further O

can O
not O
realize O
his O

at O

The O
merchant O
reiterates O
in O
a O
statement O
that O
IG B-ORG

paid O
a O

to O

" O
, O
the O
current O
council O
said O
at O
the O
time O
. O

If O
the O
SPD B-ORG
wants O
to O
elect O
Erich B-PER
Pipa I-PER
back O
to O
the O
First O
Circuit O
in O
Schloßberghalle B-LOC
next O
Friday O
, O
it O
will O
need O
two O
additional O
votes O
from O
another O
camp O
in O
addition O
to O
its O
own O
. O

The O
Greens B-ORG
had O
already O
made O
a O
look O
at O
Pipa B-PER
not O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
secret O
vote O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
CDU B-ORG
has O
opposed O
speculation O
that O
there O
are O
supposedly O
" O
submarines O
" O
in O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
Union O
that O
have O
fought O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
First O
Circle O
Commander O
. O

Pipa B-PER
said O
he O
would O
“ O
no O
longer O
be O
allowed O
to O
vote O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
neo B-MISC
- I-MISC
Nazis I-MISC
. O
” O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
he O
considers O
it O
necessary O
that O
the O
position O
of O
the O
First O
Circle O
Associate O
should O
not O
remain O
unoccupied O
for O
months O
. O

Pipa B-PER
, O
who O
has O
used O
abstractions O
to O
accuse O
disappointed O
journalists O
, O
appeals O
to O
the O
circular O
members O
not O
to O
escape O
their O
responsibilities O
. O

So O
he O
already O
publicly O
stated O
that O
“ O
another O
circus O
director O
must O
run O
if O
I O
am O
not O
re O
- O
elected O
at O
the O
end O
of O
August O
. O
” O

The O
position O
should O
then O
be O
immediately O
discharged O
and O
a O
preparatory O
committee O
should O
be O
established O
. O

On O
the O
subject O
of O

, O

not O

However O
, O
the O
SPD B-ORG
has O
announced O
that O
it O
will O
submit O
the O
re O
- O
election O
request O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O

only O
if O
it O
is O
previously O
ruled O
out O
that O
Pipa B-PER
can O
only O
remain O
in O
office O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
NPD B-ORG
. O

In O
the O
circular O
day O
, O
however O
, O
not O
only O
the O
topic O
of O
re O
- O
election O
plays O
a O
role O
, O
it O
is O
soon O
also O
about O
the O

holders I-MISC
from O
Hanau B-LOC
, O

has O
finally O
put O
the O
chair O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
to O
the O

expert O
, O
although O
it O
was O
unthinkable O
at O
the O

( O
14:12 O
) O
, O
and O
has O
decided O
on O
a O
selection O
proposal O
( O
which O
FR B-ORG
) O
. O

Even O
before O
the O
summer O
holidays O
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
’ O
district O
board O
had O
declared O
that O
the O
SPD B-ORG
would O
have O
to O
use O
Friedrich B-PER
again O
as O
a O

deserter O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O

, O
Friedrich B-PER
was O
even O
praised O
as O
Koryphäe O
by O
the O

Green B-MISC

In O

Although O
the O
SPD B-ORG
would O
like O
to O
send O
the O
district O

to O
the O

, O
Friedrich B-PER

election O
probably O
fails O
at O
the O
required O

because O

From O
a O
scientific O
point O
of O
view O
, O
Morlock B-PER
sees O
no O

to O
the O

. O

As O
he O
reiterated O
in O
the O
FR B-MISC
controversy I-MISC
, O
dioxins O
have O
always O
been O
present O
in O
the O
ecosystem O
. O

Dioxins O
are O
generated O
in O
almost O
every O
combustion O
process O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
halogens O
( O
the O
group O

) O
. O

In O

. O

100 O
% O
of O
the O
dioxins O
can O
not O
be O
removed O
from O
the O

, O
which O
is O
why O
he O
considers O
the O
demands O
of O
the O
Hanau B-MISC
Greens B-ORG
for O
a O
zero O
emission O
of O
the O
urban O
crematorium O
to O
be O
unfair O
. O

The O

was O
identified O
by O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Trade O
Inspectorate O
as O
one O
of O
the O
sources O
of O
the O

. O

According O
to O
Neidhardt B-PER
, O
this O
corresponds O
to O
an O
eighth O
of O
the O
total O

. O

The O
other O

Morlock B-PER
's I-PER
thesis O
firmly O
contradicts O
the O
BUND B-MISC
scientist I-MISC
Rolf B-PER
Neidhardt I-PER
. O

Dioxins O
have O
only O
existed O
in O
the O
ecosystem O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
chlorine O
chemistry O
. O

In O
crude O
oil O
, O
coal O
, O
or O
even O
in O
mummified O
, O
centuries O
- O
old O
eschimals O
, O
no O
traces O
of O
dioxin O
have O
been O
found O
. O

Scientific O
studies O
in O
wood O
burns O
would O
also O
have O
shown O
high O
concentrations O
of O
dioxin O
only O
if O
, O
for O
example O
, O
PVC O
was O
added O
. O

According O
to O
Neidhardt B-PER
, O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O
so O
dramatically O
in O
recent O
years O
that O
the O
federal O
government O
publicly O
considers O
remedies O
necessary O
and O
advocates O
the O
closure O
of O
unnecessary O
sources O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
BUND B-ORG
looks O
at O
the O
urban O
crematorium O
and O
is O
opposed O
to O
the O
incineration O
of O
people O
in O
whose O
fat O
tissue O
dioxin O
is O
concentrated O
. O

Gerhard B-PER
Morlock I-PER
does O
not O
contradict O
the O
view O
that O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O
. O

However O
, O
he O
considers O
the O
installation O
of O
about O
one O
electric O
filter O
in O
the O
plant O
to O
be O
sufficient O
to O
meet O
the O
limit O
value O
. O
” O

I O
think O
the O
little O
exhaust O
from O
the O
crematorium O
is O
insignificant O
, O
” O
says O
Morlock B-PER
. O

As O
a O
potentially O
much O
larger O
source O
of O
stress O
, O
he O
sees O
the O
" O
enormous O
amounts O
of O
smoke O
from O
the O
Staudinger B-LOC
power O
plant O
" O
. O

It O
should O
be O
measured O
in O
his O
opinion O
. O

Although O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
per O
cubic O
meter O
of O
exhaust O
air O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
measurable O
, O
the O
huge O
amount O
contributes O

confesses O
Peter B-PER
Klemm I-PER
, O
expert O
adviser O
on O
addiction O
prevention O
and O
drug O
issues O
at O
schools O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
eleven O
primary O
school O
teachers O
from O
the O
high B-LOC
school I-LOC
circles I-LOC
have O
enrolled O
for O
the O
course O
, O
which O
began O
last O
February O
. O

A O
total O
of O
eight O
afternoons O
were O
planned O
plus O
one O
full O
- O
day O
seminar O
and O
two O
three O
- O
day O
courses O
- O
spread O
over O
18 O
months O
. O

The O
surprise O
of O
the O
participants O
quickly O
led O
to O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

Already O
in O
elementary O
school O
age O
, O
the O
foundations O
for O
the O
later O
relationship O
of O
children O
to O
addictions O
are O
laid O
. O

Listen O
to O
addiction O
prevention O
, O
most O
people O
think O
of O
the O
hard O
drugs O
right O
away O
, O
” O
explains O
Peter B-PER
Klemm I-PER
. O

There O
are O
many O
different O
types O
of O
addiction O
. O
” O

For O
him O
, O
the O
risk O
of O
addiction O
is O
closely O
linked O
to O
the O
manifestation O
of O
personality O
, O
and O
it O
is O
here O
that O
the O
trained O
teachers O
should O
start O
. O

In O
elementary O
school O
, O
through O
the O
relatively O
close O
contact O
with O
the O
students O
, O
they O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
direct O
their O
personality O
development O
in O
positive O
ways O
. O

Children O
must O
learn O
to O
say O
“ O
no O
” O
and O
they O
should O
develop O
the O
ability O
to O
have O
real O
social O
relationships O
. O
” O

The O
sooner O
we O
start O
, O
the O
easier O
it O
is O
to O
avoid O
malformations O
, O
” O
confirms O
Klemm B-PER
, O
a O
counselling O
teacher O
at O
Oberursel B-ORG
High I-ORG
School I-ORG
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
risk O
of O
addiction O
in O
primary O
schools O
can O
not O
be O
ignored O
. O

A O
report O
by O
the O
Hesse B-ORG
State I-ORG
Government I-ORG
on O
the O
use O
of O
drugs O
in O
Hesse B-MISC
schools O
speaks O
of O
“ O
20 O
to O
25 O
percent O
of O
all O
elementary O
schoolchildren O
” O
who O
“ O
are O
not O
only O
occasionally O
receiving O
drugs O
to O
enhance O
performance O
and O
promote O
concentration O
” O
. O

According O
to O
this O
report O
, O
ten O
percent O
of O
elementary O
school O
students O
are O
under O
“ O
permanent O
medication O
. O
” O

Even O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
light O
, O
sweet O
- O
tasting O
alcoholics O
is O
not O
disgusted O
by O
ten O
percent O
of O
students O
at O
the O
end O
of O
primary O
school O
. O

According O
to O
Peter B-PER
Klemm I-PER
, O
the O
danger O
is O
great O
that O
it O
will O
become O
a O
pattern O
for O
children O
to O
“ O
take O
a O
pill O
against O
every O
problem O
. O
” O

In O
order O
not O
to O
give O
the O
addicts O
a O
chance O
as O
substitutes O
for O
their O
own O
positive O
emotions O
, O
one O
of O
the O
tasks O
of O
counseling O
teachers O
is O
to O
promote O
the O
experiential O
ability O
of O
children O

Conflicts O
that O
arise O
must O
be O
addressed O
and O
resolved O
on O
their O
own O

However O
, O
the O
teachers O
are O
also O
a O
point O
of O
contact O
for O
affected O
parents O
and O
for O
school O
colleagues O
. O

However O
, O
the O
counseling O
instructors O
do O
not O
undertake O
therapeutic O
activity O
, O
but O
advise O
and O
refer O
to O
other O
offices O
if O
necessary O
. O

The O
competent O
institutions O
such O
as O

their O
tasks O
were O
acquainted O
with O
them O
during O
the O
course O
of O
the O

. O

Particular O
emphasis O
was O
placed O
on O
the O

during O
the O

not O

Because O
there O

of O
the O

all O

The O
fact O
that O
there O
has O
not O
been O
much O
damage O
so O
far O
, O
however O
, O
the O
forest O
is O
due O
to O
a O
rather O
unfavorable O
circumstance O

it O
: O

" O
The O

Such O
a O

can O
be O
drawn O

In O
order O

The O

" O
. O

This O
means O
an O
indirect O
subsidy O
, O
explains O
the O
mayor O
, O
because O
those O
affected O
then O
do O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
any O
channel O
fees O
for O
the O
drinking O
water O
. O

That O
is O
4.50 O
mark O
per O
cubic O
meter O
. O

Moreover O
, O
however O
, O
Martin B-PER
is O
not O
quite O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
emergency O
regulation O
. O

Since O
, O
as O
, O
lawns O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
be O
blown O
up O
, O
he O
fears O
great O
damage O
to O
the O
sports O
facilities O
. O

He O
has O
therefore O
requested O
an O
exemption O
from O
the O
Government O
. O

The O
sports O
facilities O
are O
now O
arranged O
so O
that O
they O
can O
be O
played O
even O
after O
rain O
, O
and O
well O
drained O
. O

So O
they O
dry O
out O
very O
quickly O
if O
they O
are O
not O
calculated O
regularly O
, O
says O
Martin B-PER
. O

If O
the O
sports O
facilities O
were O
not O
exploded O
, O
there O
would O
be O
damage O
to O
the O
municipality O
of O
about O
50,000 O
mark O
per O
place O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
rain O
has O
helped O
the O
distressed O
communities O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
drought O
issue O
is O
likely O
to O
trigger O
a O
fundamental O
debate O
about O
the O
installation O
of O
sports O
venues O
. O

Landrat O
Rolf B-PER
Gnadl I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
has O
already O
opened O
the O
discussion O
about O
golf O

. O

For O
Niddatal B-LOC
, O
the O
mayor O
does O
not O
see O
the O
water O
problem O
as O
dramatically O
as O
in O
the O
urban O
area O
. O

Through O

Both O

There O
would O
be O
apartheid O
in O
Israel B-LOC

Again O
, O
the O
alternative O
is O
autonomy O
or O
the O
continuation O
of O

. O

The O
only O
solution O
is O
a O
country O
for O
the O
Palestinians B-MISC

a O
country O
for O
us O
. O

I O
want O
to O
end O
this O
endless O
tragedy O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
want O
Palestinian B-MISC

The O
suffering O
of O

As O
a O
politician O
, O
as O
a O
Jew B-MISC

as O

It O
does O
not O
leave O
me O
at O
peace O

and O
I O
have O
to O
find O
a O
solution O
, O
even O
though O
this O
solution O
is O
difficult O
for O
many O
Israelis B-MISC
because O
they O
say O
, O
like O
Mr. O
Steiner B-PER
, O
the O
land O
belongs O
to O
us O
. O

But O
we O
need O
peace O
, O
otherwise O
we O
will O
jeopardize O
Israel B-LOC

democracy O
and O
cultural O
achievements O

The O
Lyders B-PER
: O

Mr O
Steiner B-PER
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
ask O
you O
again O
. O

In O
the O
occupied O
territories O
– O
you O
call O
them O
the O
Liberated O
Territories O
– O
almost O
two O
million O
Palestinians B-MISC
live O
who O
are O
proven O
not O
to O
want O
to O
live O
under O
Israeli B-MISC
rule O
. O

What O
political O
perspective O
do O
you O
offer O
to O
these O
people O
? O

by O
Steiner B-PER
: O

It O
is O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
the O
Palestinians B-MISC
will O
accept O
nothing O
but O
full O
political O
autonomy O
that O
ultimately O
leads O
to O
a O
Palestinian B-LOC
state I-LOC
. O

If O
Mr. O
Virshubski B-PER
wants O
to O
explain O
to O
us O
here O
that O
the O
death O
of O
so O
many O
people O
hurts O
him O
— O
well O
, O
that O
hurts O
us O
all O
. O

As O
long O
as O
there O
was O
no O
Intifada B-MISC
, O
the O
people O
there O
lived O
very O
well O
and O
normally O
, O
economically O
they O
developed O
magnificently O
, O
they O
did O
good O
business O
. O

But O
when O
then O
the O
PLO B-ORG
began O
to O
stir O
up O
unrest O
, O
there O
was O
a O
fight O
, O
and O
in O
a O
fight O
there O
are O
unfortunately O
victims O
. O

The O
Lyders B-PER
: O

I O
would O
like O
to O
give O
you O
an O
interpretation O
of O
the O
Intifada B-MISC
. O

and O
again O
: O

What O
kind O
of O
political O
model O
do O
you O
offer O
to O
the O
Palestinians B-MISC
? O

by O
Steiner B-PER
: O

very O
simply O
. O

To O
be O
a O
good O
citizen O
. O

For O
centuries O
, O
Jews B-MISC
were O
a O
minority O
in O
many O
countries O
. O

The O
Lyders B-PER
: O

Does O
this O
specifically O
mean O
that O
you O
would O
give O
all O
Palestinians B-MISC
in O
the O
occupied O
territories O
Israeli B-MISC
passports O
? O

by O
Steiner B-PER
: O

As O
long O
as O
these O
people O
recognize O
the O
Israeli B-LOC
state I-LOC
, O
behave O
decently O
like O
any O
citizen O
– O
why O
not O

we O

Reason O
for O
joy O
has O
the O
municipality O
according O
to O
information O
of O
Mayor O
Horst B-PER
Gölzenleuchter I-PER
: O

Büttelborn B-LOC
was O
included O
in O

The O

will O
have O
to O
raise O
a O
total O
of O
1.4 O
million O
mark O
, O
including O
construction O
sites O
. O

However O
, O
this O
expenditure O
should O
be O
welcomed O
because O
of O
the O
housing O
scarcity O
municipal O
policy O
despite O
the O
otherwise O
generally O
required O
austerity O
. O

The O

Maingau B-MISC

at O
surprise O
past O
Eschborn B-LOC
missed O
two O
rings O
to O
win O
against O
top O
riders O

The O
SG B-ORG
Eschborn I-ORG
almost O
caused O
the O
sensation O
at O
all O
in O
the O
gauklass O
round O
fights O
of O
the O
standard O
rifle O
shooters O
. O

Only O
two O
rings O
were O
missing O
to O
the O
Eschborners B-MISC
to O
victory O
over O
table O
leader O
SG B-ORG
Tell I-ORG
Dietzenbach I-ORG
. O

The O
Dietzenbacher B-MISC
have O
so O
far O
only O
had O
to O
give O
one O
point O
and O
lead O
the O
table O
before O
the O
SG B-ORG
Bad I-ORG
Homburg I-ORG
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
Eschborner B-MISC
are O
ranked O
at O
the O
last O
place O
with O
2:10 O
counters O
. O

Even O
more O
surprising O
is O
the O
result O
of O
the O
Eschborner B-MISC
Schützen O
in O
the O
guest O
game O
of O
the O
top O
rider O
: O

The O
hosts O
scored O
1040 O
rings O
, O
the O
Dietzenbacher B-MISC
just O
hit O
more O
. O

Especially O
irritating O
for O
the O
Eschborner B-MISC
: O

Had O
Thomas B-PER
Körber I-PER
( O
255 O
) O
been O
in O
the O
team O
and O
not O
Peter B-PER
Zychon I-PER
( O
242 O
) O
, O
then O
the O
surprise O
would O
have O
been O
perfect O
. O

However O
, O
Körber O
was O
only O
nominated O
as O
a O
replacement O
shooter O
and O
his O
result O
did O
not O
fit O
the O
rating O
. O

So O
the O
SG B-ORG
Bad I-ORG
Homburg I-ORG
continues O
to O
rank O
a O
counter O
behind O
the O
Dietzenbachers B-MISC
in O
second O
place O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
direct O
confrontation O
between O
the O
two O
leading O
teams O
. O

In O
good O
shape O
, O
the O
Bad B-MISC
Homburger I-MISC
presented O
themselves O
against O
the O
SG B-ORG
Neu I-ORG
- O
Isenburg O
, O
which O
they O
defeated O
safely O
with O
1079 O
to O
1053 O
. O

Best O
shooter O
of O
the O
Bad B-MISC
Homburger I-MISC
and O
also O
of O
the O
entire O
sixth O
passage O
was O
Peter B-PER
Suchomil I-PER
with O
278 O
rings O
. O

Dietzenbacher B-MISC
Heiko B-PER
Wilts I-PER
came O
closest O
to O
him O
with O
276 O
rings O
. O

Third O
place O
is O
followed O
by O
Lutz B-PER
Voigt I-PER
, O
another O
Bad B-MISC
Homburger I-MISC
with O
275 O

the O

The O

Everyone O

Otherwise O
, O
it O
may O
happen O
that O
someone O
in O

will O
break O
the O

Because O
he O
himself O
has O
received O
some O

this O

he O
could O
also O
understand O

Of O
this O

however O
, O
in O
the O
article O
is O
as O
little O
to O

it O

that O

His O
principle O

was O

the O
hope O

both O

not O
only O

However O
, O
it O
is O

even O
the O

a O

Divided O

175,000 O
in O

Repressed O
since O
ancient O
times O
, O
they O
were O
forced O
to O
seek O
refuge O
in O
this O
hostile O
place O
. O

The O
Makonde B-MISC
are O
a O
people O
of O
dancers O
, O
artists O
, O
and O
craftsmen O
who O
know O
how O
to O
“ O
consciously O
make O
their O
appearance O
ugly O
” O
in O
order O
to O
confirm O
their O
wrongly O
existing O
reputation O
as O
cannibals O
: O

Lip O
patches O
– O
mostly O
worn O
only O
by O
women O
– O
, O
the O
face O
and O
upper O

covering O

are O
still O
living O
customs O
that O
gave O
this O
tribe O
a O
distinct O
and O
closed O
culture O
over O
time O
. O

Often O
it O
is O
also O
claimed O
that O
they O
would O
" O
eat O
giant O
snakes O
, O
crocodiles O
, O
elephants O
, O
mice O
and O
rats O
" O
, O
but O
if O
you O
know O
them O
more O
closely O
, O
they O
show O
themselves O
as O
" O
hospitable O
, O
simple O
, O
generous O
and O
peaceful O
people O
" O
, O
the O
local O
Benedikts B-MISC
report O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
the O
makondes B-MISC
possess O
a O
robust O
sense O
of O
humor O
and O
a O
pronounced O
sense O
for O
the O
caricature O
, O
which O
is O
artistically O
represented O
in O
scattered O
images O
. O

The O
approximately O
one O
hundred O
missionaries O
of O

Münsterschwarzacher B-MISC
Benedictine B-ORG
Order I-ORG
, O
who O
hold O
an O

, O
“ O

as O
a O

, O
” O
have O
adopted O
this O
African B-MISC
tribe O
and O
appreciate O
its O
artistic O
skills O
. O

They O
support O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
in O
their O
creation O
by O
buying O
them O
the O
sculptures O
, O
figures O
and O
masks O
mostly O
carved O
out O
of O
equal O
wood O

Numerous O
pieces O
are O
shown O
in O
Europe B-LOC
at O
exhibitions O
, O
such O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Hanau B-LOC

and O

their O
customers O
there O

” O

Between O
40 O
and O
50 O
percent O
of O

The O

” O
says O
the O
Dutchman B-MISC
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER

the O
organizer O
of O
the O
exhibition O

The O
cost O
of O

is O
approximately O
30,000 O

Not O
every O

that O

as O
well O
preserved O
as O
the O

in O
the O

Ten O
percent O
is O
a O
break O
, O
” O
Verdonk B-PER
says O
regrettably O
. O

In O
order O
to O
support O
the O
people O
there O
, O
the O
containers O
that O
served O
for O
the O
transport O
of O
the O
works O
of O
art O
to O
Germany B-LOC
are O
not O
loaded O
empty O
by O
sea O
, O
but O
pre O
- O
loaded O
with O
medicines O
and O
urgently O
needed O
clothes O
. O

Also O
for O
printing O
machines O
modeled O
in O
Germany B-LOC
, O
the O
missionaries O
have O
found O
use O
in O
the O
Abbey O
in O
Tanzania B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
preparation O
of O
the O
relief O
transports O
, O
the O
Benedictines B-MISC
were O
often O
given O
expert O
, O
medical O
support O
and O
donations O
in O
the O
form O
of O
medicines O
, O
because O
the O
Tanzanian B-LOC
Abbey O
is O
also O
well O
known O
to O
German B-MISC
doctors O
. O

For O
the O
exhibition O
, O
which O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
last O
week O
at O
Hanauer B-LOC
Stadtkrankenhaus I-LOC
, O
Verdonk B-PER
brought O
only O
part O
of O
the O
exhibition O
pieces O
: O

" O
When O
I O
take O
ghost O
figures O
to O
the O
exhibition O
, O
I O
select O
in O
advance O
so O
that O
the O
buyer O
gets O
only O
the O
best O
. O
" O

It O
is O
not O
always O
so O
, O
" O
that O
every O
face O
is O
equally O
beautifully O
carved O
, O
" O
the O
artists O
do O
not O
always O
have O
professional O
crafts O
available O
to O
carve O
perfect O
works O
. O

But O
maybe O
that O
’s O
what O
Makonde B-MISC
’s O
art O
is O
. O

Most O
sculptures O
make O
the O
maconde B-MISC
in O
a O
state O
of O
fear O
. O

Fear O
is O
the O
constant O
companion O
of O
this O
people O
, O
who O
, O
according O
to O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
, O
live O
in O
a O
world O
unimaginable O
for O
the O
European B-MISC
, O
entirely O
different O
. O

For O
them O
, O
a O
dream O
is O
a O
reality O
, O
which O
is O
represented O
in O
their O
works O
: O

“ O
When O
the O
Maconde B-MISC
dreams O
that O
their O
ancestors O
are O
angry O
with O
them O
because O
no O
one O
thinks O
of O
them O
anymore O
, O
they O
get O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
begin O
to O
carve O
out O
the O
contours O
of O
their O
grandmother O
. O
” O

Their O
bad O
conscience O
is O
so O
often O
the O
starting O
point O
of O
work O
. O

The O
makondas B-MISC
also O
constantly O
feel O
surrounded O
by O
demons O
, O
in O
the O
Swahili B-MISC
language I-MISC
" O
Shetani O
" O
. O

Of O
the O
“ O
Shetani O
” O
there O
is O
a O
rich O
variety O
. O

They O
are O
mostly O
mixed O
creatures O
of O
humans O
and O
animals O
that O
are O
predatory O
, O
drive O
shabernack O
and O
hide O
. O

But O
not O
all O
ghosts O
consider O
the O
maconde B-MISC
dangerous O
: O

“ O
The O
good O
spirits O
are O
recognized O
by O
the O
gentle O
and O
great O
eye O
, O
” O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
said O
. O

Also O
with O
erotics O
are O
dealing O
the O
sculptors O
. O

This O
element O
is O
often O
hidden O
under O
symbols O
, O
but O
sometimes O
also O
clearly O
visible O
. O

Sexuality O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
a O
world O
of O
religion O
and O
magic O
, O
connecting O
power O
and O
means O
of O
integration O
. O

The O
female O
fertility O
is O
synonymous O
with O
life O
, O
as O
a O
power O
given O
by O
the O
Creator O
. O

This O
gives O
sexuality O
a O
sacred O
character O
, O
with O
the O
genitals O
almost O
always O
becoming O
the O
object O
of O
worship O
. O

Another O
motif O
of O
great O
importance O
is O
the O
Tree O
of O
Life O
, O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
represent O
" O
the O
unity O
of O
all O
mankind O
" O
. O

They O
do O
n’t O
live O
like O
we O
do O
in O
Europe B-LOC
as O
an O
individual O
, O
they O
live O
as O
a O
unity O
that O
they O
want O
to O
artistically O
represent O
in O
the O
tree O
of O
life O
, O
” O
Verdonk B-PER
explains O
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
natural O
people O
. O

That O
’s O
why O
he O
can O
never O
answer O
the O
questions O
of O
exhibition O
visitors O
, O
as O
the O
respective O
artist O
might O
be O
called O
. O
” O

Since O
no O
one O
signs O
his O
work O
, O
as O
with O
us O
, O
where O
the O
name O
is O
often O
more O
important O
than O
the O
actual O
work O
of O
art O
. O
” O

The O
exhibits O
displayed O
in O
Hanau B-LOC
convey O
something O
strange O
, O
they O
express O
what O
the O
maconde B-MISC
may O
have O
felt O
in O
making O
. O

The O
magical O
world O
from O
which O
they O
originate O
is O
ubiquitous O
, O
even O
able O
to O
infuse O
fear O
in O
the O
spectators O
. O

The O
exhibition O
can O
be O
visited O
until O

from O

have O
granted O
a O

several O
times O

left O

the O

example O
, O
was O

of O
the O
citizen O
sitting O
on O

for O
a O
reduction O

were O
not O
justified O
, O
as O
the O
Kasseler B-ORG
Verwaltungsgericht I-ORG
( O

) O
was O
now O
in O
first O
instance O
. O

They O
thus O
dismissed O
the O
lawsuit O
of O
Hessen B-LOC

who O
had O
hoped O
for O
judicial O
aid O
in O
the O
" O

dispute O
" O
. O

To O
his O
house O
leads O
only O
a O
shuttle B-LOC
road I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
probably O
- O
and O
that O
is O
undoubtedly O
- O
difficult O
to O
walk O
, O
especially O
in O
winter O
weather O
. O

Especially O
for O
the O
heavy O
garbage O
cars O
. O

In O
one O
quarter O
, O
the O
garbage O
makers O
had O
left O
the O
claimant O
's O
filled O
waste O
ton O
seven O
times O
. O

When O
he O
complained O
, O
he O
was O
offered O
, O
even O
for O
free O
, O
additional O
garbage O
bags O
. O

He O
accepted O
it O
thankfully O
. O

To O
bring O
his O
garbage O
about O
170 O
meters O
wide O
to O
a O
place O
where O
the O
tons O
could O
have O
been O
empty O
, O
he O
refused O
. O

Finally O
, O
in O
the O
waste O
statute O
it O
is O
stated O
that O
the O
garbage O
is O
collected O
on O
the O
property O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
demanded O
a O
corresponding O
reduction O
in O
fees O
, O
but O
the O
judges O
also O
granted O
him O
a O
removal O
. O

They O
relied O
( O
like O
the O
commune O
) O
on O
a O
different O
passage O
of O
the O
statute O
. O

It O
states O
that O
, O
for O
example O
, O
in O
cases O
of O
" O
major O
force O
" O
there O
is O
no O
right O
to O
normal O
waste O
disposal O
. O

And O
bad O
weather O
is O
higher O
violence O
. O

The O
statute O
and O
the O
decision O
on O
fees O
were O
therefore O
approved O
by O
the O
court O
, O
and O
the O
claim O
for O
a O
refund O
of O
fees O
was O
therefore O
declared O
unjustified O
. O

Whoever O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
does O
not O
use O
the O
possibility O
to O
empty O
his O
rubbish O
container O
in O
another O
( O
accessible O

place O
, O
so O
the O
final O
, O
simple O
finding O
of O
the O
VG B-ORG
, O
can O
not O
later O
also O
reclaim O
any O

. O

It O
is O
assumed O
that O
the O
Hesse B-LOC
will O
in O
the O
future O
drag O
his O
garbage O
170 O

if O

not O
everywhere O

- O
a O
separation O
channel O

, O
so O
its O
own O

for O
rainwater O
and O
its O
own O
for O
dirty O
water O
such O
as O
from O
the O
kitchen O

. O

Now O
, O
if O
the O

wash O
their O

or O
pour O
out O
their O
glasses O
with O
water O

this O

has O
not O

noticed O
by O

for O
100 O
years O
- O
until O

the O

arrived O

The O

indicated O

from O
the O
Nidda B-LOC
to O
the O
city O
school O
. O

The O
town O
of O
Bad B-LOC
Vilbel I-LOC
therefore O
called O
on O
the O
circle O
to O
build O
a O
dirty O
water O
canal O
. O

Because O
although O
the O
school O
house O
was O
once O
built O
by O
the O
city O
, O
it O
has O
passed O
into O
the O
school O
ownership O
of O
the O
circle O
. O

The O
more O
than O
100,000 O
mark O
costly O
canal O

hurts O
the O
circle O
bumped O
by O
Finanznot O
very O
much O

just O
been O

Therefore O
, O
after O
a O
meeting O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
Harald B-PER
Mehr I-PER
, O
head O
of O
the O
school O
administration O
in O
Friedberg B-LOC
, O
said O
the O
circle O
would O
rather O
put O
the O
money O
into O
other O
projects O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
better O
for O
the O
school O
authority O
to O
have O
obtained O
permission O
from O
the O
city O
to O
connect O
the O
rainwater O
canal O
through O
a O

to O
the O
dirt O
water O

. O

That O
would O
only O
cost O
a O
fraction O
of O
a O
new O
line O
. O

The O
city O
did O
not O
comment O
on O
this O
. O

First O
City O
Councillor O
Klaus B-PER
Minkel I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
is O
concerned O
that O
such O
a O
connection O
wants O
to O
be O
carefully O
examined O
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
control O
how O
much O
rainwater O
can O
flow O
through O
this O
channel O
into O
the O
sewage O
channel O
. O

If O
large O
amounts O
of O
water O
could O
flow O
there O
, O
it O
is O
to O
be O
feared O
that O
the O
sewerage O
in O
the O
Frankfurter B-LOC

will O
be O
flooded O
and O
the O

contents O
in O

Asked O
whether O
it O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
close O
the O

if O
it O
was O
now O
planned O
to O
build O
the O
new O

in O
the O

, O
Minkel B-PER
said O
that O
was O

decision O
of O
the O
circle O

The O
canal O
could O
have O
been O
built O
during O
the O
summer O

The O

is O
not O

Among O

, O
the O
fear O
has O
been O

In O

he O

at O
the O
central O

But O
the O

was O

At O

the O

The O

thus O
withdrew O

condemned O
the O

well O
two O

in O

the O
Neu B-LOC

It O
was O
at O
18.30 O

About O
15 O
minutes O
later O
, O
train O
and O

returned O
from O
an O

a O
large O

examined O
the O

the O

, O
others O
spent O
the O
time O
with O

with O

the O

Nevertheless O

even O
well O
four O

after O
the O

loud O

remained O
the O
exception O
, O
the O
angry O
percentage O

had O
already O
settled O
on O

across O

It O
was O
incomprehensible O
to O

that O

not O

For O

the O

was O
a O

So O
the O

dropped O
a O

The O

raised O
the O

to O

The O

Instead O
of O
the O

However O
, O
Kelsterbach B-LOC

The O

The O

Spahn B-PER
accused O
Treutel B-PER
that O
he O
could O
and O
must O
have O
known O
at O
the O
passing O
of O
the O
decree O
on O
29 O
April O
1992 O
that O
there O
will O
be O
minor O

Spahn B-PER
asked O
in O
a O
committee O
meeting O
on O
23 O
April O
how O
it O
would O
be O
with O
the O
compensation O
, O
since O
he O
had O
heard O
from O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Social B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
that O
there O
would O
be O
minimum O

. O

The O
mayor O
then O
asked O
not O
to O
disclose O
this O
information O
to O
the O
public O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
city O
. O

Treutel B-PER
confirmed O
that O
he O
did O
this O
" O
almost O
hands O

on O
" O
: O

If O
the O
rumor O
had O
become O
public O
, O
sleeping O
dogs O
might O
have O
been O
awakened O
, O
" O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC

the O

would O
have O
begun O
to O
think O
about O
really O
changing O
something O
on O
the O
compensation O

. O
" O

He O
thanked O
the O
WIK B-ORG
for O
the O
restraint O
. O

Following O
Spahns B-PER
’ O
indication O
of O
falling O

he O
had O
spoken O
to O

Frankfurter B-MISC

stated O
that O

Renate B-PER
Stiebing I-PER
criticized O
that O
the O
minor O

had O
only O
become O
public O
" O
by O
chance O
" O
in O
July O
, O
when O
Treutel B-PER
told O
about O
it O
in O
a O
radio O

When O
Spahn B-PER
then O
addressed O
the O
issue O
at O
a O
committee O
meeting O
in O
August O

the O
mayor O
had O
taken O
him O
to O
the O

he O
wanted O
to O
speak O

In O

there O
will O
be O
no O

the O

In O

, O
however O
, O
it O
happens O
from O

entertainment O

programmes O
for O
children O
, O
which O
the O

offers O

designed O
so O
that O
they O
bring O
the O

In O
the O
specific O
case O
, O
according O
to O
the O
content O
of O
the O
catalog O
description O
, O
customers O
were O
allowed O

The O

It O
is O
pointless O
to O

completely O
different O

defends O

" O
in O
some O
places O
both O

pass O
into O

then O

" O

Oldfield B-PER
goes O
even O
further O
, O
swallowed O
by O
the O
childish O
enthusiasm O
of O
Steven B-PER
Spielberg I-PER
, O
whom O
he O
greatly O
admires O
, O
" O
mostly O
because O

recovered O
musical O
substance O
. O

The O
comparison O
hangs O
, O
but O
Oldfield B-PER
takes O
it O
seriously O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
his O
new O
instrumental O
shake O
is O
only O
a O
bad O
copy O
of O
the O
original O
- O
a O
coherent O
style O
thread O
that O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
cramped O
together O
with O
abrupt O
changes O
in O

but O
still O
disintegrates O

The O

quite O

the O

That O
the O

is O
poor O
, O
Oldfield B-PER
admits O
, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
surprising O
, O
because O
he O
would O
have O

The O
question O

been O
out O

Anyone O
who O
wants O
can O

Until O

half O

And O
in O

only O

welcome O
for O

For O
Heinz B-PER
Schlosser I-PER
, O
the O
once O
patriarchal O
pattern O
has O
historical O
reasons O
. O

The O
years O
after O
the O
First B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
were O
troubled O
and O
turbulent O
, O
causing O
many O
young O
people O
distress O
and O

They O
wanted O
a O
stop O

The O
words O
of O
Kaplan O
Georg B-PER
Pistor I-PER
: O

On O
August O
14 O
, O
1922 O
, O
he O
founded O
the O
Catholic O
Society O
. O

The O
objectives O
: O

Training O
and O
sport O
, O
active O
neighborhood O
assistance O
and O
sociability O
. O

These O
tasks O
have O
not O
changed O
much O
even O
in O
the O
seven O
decades O
of O
existence O
, O
although O
the O
company O
has O
only O
been O
a O
real O
family O
since O
the O
mid-1960s O
. O

Our O
focus O
is O
on O
educational O
work O
, O
” O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
referring O
to O
a O
rich O
offer O
of O
lectures O
and O
seminars O
. O

Therefore O
, O
they O
are O
little O
to O
be O
described O
. O
” O

Themes O
concerning O
Rome B-LOC
are O
not O
at O
issue O
with O
us O
. O
” O

Members O
do O
what O
they O
think O
is O
important O
. O
” O

We O
demand O
social O
commitment O
from O
everyone O
. O
” O

And O
this O
, O
of O
course O
, O
also O
means O
dealing O
with O
critical O
and O
current O
issues O
- O
for O
example O
, O
paragraph O
218 O
. O

Not O
only O
to O
be O
far O
from O
home O
, O
in O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
is O
open O
to O
: O

“ O
All O
opinions O
are O
represented O
here O
, O
” O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
. O

Talk O
about O
everything O
. O
” O

We O
work O
freely O
, O
not O
under O
pressure O
from O
parish O
communities O
or O
other O
agencies O
. O
” O

Can O
Schlosser B-PER
imagine O
a O
discussion O
round O
with O
church O
critic O
Eugen B-PER
Drewermann I-PER
? O

Why O
not O
? O
” O

The O
interest O
, O
especially O
among O
young O
people O
, O
would O
be O
there O
. O

But O
if O
Drewermann B-PER
would O
come O
to O
a O
place O
like O
Hochheim B-LOC
, O
Schlosser B-PER
asks O
. O

Critically O
illuminated O
, O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
also O
has O
another O
topic O
: O

500 O
years O
after O
Columbus B-PER
. O

The O
anniversary O
was O
little O
to O
celebrate O
for O
the O
members O
, O
rather O
an O
occasion O
to O
reflect O
. O

Finally O
, O
in O
many O
countries O
, O
they O
help O
to O
alleviate O
the O
consequences O
of O
exploitation O
: O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Brazil B-LOC
, O
where O
a O
project O
aims O
to O
stop O
people O
’s O
displacement O
, O
or O
in O
Nigeria B-LOC
, O
when O
building O
a O
well O
and O
a O
vocational O
training O
center O
. O

But O
not O
only O
far O
away O
from O
home O
, O
there O
is O
something O
to O
do O
for O
fellow O
people O
. O

Expatriates O
and O
displaced O
persons O
need O
help O
to O
integrate O
into O
society O
. O

Tips O
on O
tenant O
protection O
, O
social O
law O
and O
other O
issues O
of O
everyday O
life O
are O
needed O
. O

The B-PER
example O
of O
Schloss O
: O

“ O
The O
insurance O
representatives O
are O
entering O
people O
’s O
doors O
, O
and O
they O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
they O
are O
signing O
. O
” O

So O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
also O
tries O
in O
consumer O
advice O
. O

Such O
commitment O
costs O
not O
only O
time O
, O
but O
also O
money O
. O
” O

We O
just O
have O
to O
do O
a O
few O
things O
, O
” O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
calling O
the O
social O
part O
of O
family O
life O
as O
a O
financial O
source O
: O

Seven O
events O
on O
fasching O
and O
standing O
at O
the O
Wine O
Festival O
must O
throw O
out O
enough O
to O
get O
over O
the O
rounds O
. O

And O
of O
course O
, O
donations O
are O
collected O
again O
and O
again O
- O
also O
at O
the O
70th O
anniversary O
celebration O
on O
Sunday O
, O
August O
30 O
, O
at O
10:30 O
p.m. O
, O
in O
the O
church O
of O
Peter B-PER
and O
Paul B-PER
. O

The O
money O
goes O
to O
Peter B-PER
Osuchukwu I-PER
. O

The O
Nigerian B-LOC
pastor O
wants O
to O
fund O
projects O
in O
his O
hometown O
. O

But O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
seems O
to O
make O
little O
impression O
on O
young O
people O
. O
” O

We O
’re O
dealing O
with O
it O
like O
everyone O
else O
, O
” O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
referring O
to O
declining O
numbers O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
offer O
for O
young O
people O
- O
the O
regular O
meetings O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
educational O
vacation O
, O
the O
purpose O
of O
which O
is O
chosen O
by O
the O
group O
itself O
. O
" O

“ O
Well O
, O
” O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
“ O
for O
the O
future O
I O
wish O
that O
the O
young O
people O
participate O
more O
. O

Because O
only O
in O
this O
way O
can O
they O
contribute O
to O
shaping O
