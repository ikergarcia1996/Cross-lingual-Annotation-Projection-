been O

opposition O
since O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
grand O

of O
Christian B-ORG

As O
reported O

after O

there O
will O
probably O
be O
no O

The O
Greens B-ORG
in O

in O

had O
therefore O
invited O
to O

in O

in O

himself O
had O

Without O
the O
Greens B-ORG
in O
their O
midst O
, O
the O
Ordinary B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
settled O
in O
just O
57 O
minutes O
of O
its O
duty O
to O
negotiate O
an O
agenda O
of O
almost O
two O
dozen O
items O
in O
the O
public O
part O
. O

There O
were O
only O
three O
real O
issues O
, O
everything O
else O
was O
dealt O
with O
without O
debate O
. O

The O
city O
has O
changed O
its O

Friday O
evening O
, O
whereby O
the O
collection O
of O

as O
garden O
waste O
is O
now O
also O
fixed O
in O

. O

The O

will O
examine O

with O
the O
help O
of O

Clemens B-PER
Jäger I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
in O
this O
context O
escaped O
the O
remarkable O
statement O
that O
excessive O
water O
consumption O
must O
be O
re O

dispensable O
in O
the O
future O
, O
which O
led O
Karl O

Heinz B-PER
Schönberg I-PER
( O

) O
to O
the O
equally O
well O
- O
founded O
replica O
that O
one O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
water O
sparingly O
. O

In O
view O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
was O
also O
a O
joint O
motion O
by O
the O
coalitionists O
, O
the O
vote O
was O
clear O
. O

Meanwhile O
the O
green B-ORG
must O
have O
sounded O
the O
ears O
. O

Surely O
their O
all O
- O
rounder O
Christian B-PER
Groß I-PER
would O
have O
also O
come O
up O
with O
a O
few O
words O

and O
because O
he O
was O
missing O
on O
this O
evening O

that O
was O

what O

Karl B-PER

on O
longer O
speeches O
, O
which O
would O
certainly O
not O
have O
been O
contradicted O
by O
the O
Greens B-ORG

in O

the O
arguments O
for O

If O

I O
would O

in O

of O

This O
was O
also O
the O
reason O
why O
the O
game O
of O
leg B-PER
was O
much O
more O
aggressively O
aligned O

Again O

again O

avoid O
the O

Assassin O
Axel B-PER

Anthony B-PER

few O
minutes O

, O
the O
Ghanaian B-MISC

the O

work O

Questions O
that O
the O
two O
Colognes B-MISC
had O
to O
ask O
themselves O
. O

Especially O
Illgner B-PER
, O
who O
stuck O
on O
his O
goal O
line O
, O
while O
Yeboah B-PER
could O
act O
unpressive O
in O
the O
five O
- O
meter O
space O
. O

One O
who O
no O
longer O
belongs O
to O
the O
circle O
of O
harmony B-ORG
, O
was O
in O
spite O
of O
everything O
again O
in O
the O
center O
: O

The O
" O
Juventus B-MISC
player I-MISC
" O
, O
as O
Stepanovic B-PER
Andreas B-PER
Möller I-PER
also O
calls O
further O
, O
ghosted O
by O
all O
heads O
. O

And O
Captain O
Uli B-PER
Stein I-PER
finally O
summed O
up O
what O
many O
thought O
: O

" O
It O
can O
also O
be O
done O
without O
Möller B-PER
. O

There O
is O
more O
fighting O
, O
we O
all O
stick O
together O
. O

That O
's O
how O
we O
would O
have O
been O
championed O
last O
season O
. O
" O

Another O
clear O
rejection O
for O
Möller B-PER
, O
to O
whom O
nobody O
wept O
a O
tear O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
victory O
. O

Maybe O
Stein B-PER
also O
wanted O
to O
distract O
only O
from O
his O
own O
- O
not O
always O
error O
- O
free O
- O
performance O
. O

Twice O
he O
erred O
somewhat O
disoriented O
through O
the O
penalty O
area O
, O
twice O
the O
harmony O
had O
great O
luck O
not O
to O
be O
caught O
in O
the O
back O
. O

Alfons B-PER
Higl I-PER
put O
a O
headball O
to O
the O
outside O
net O
, O
before O
it O
was O
Olaf B-PER
Janßen I-PER
, O
who O
in O
the O
first O
section O
only O
hit O
the O
latte O
, O
this O
time O
the O
ball O
over O
the O
defense O
lupped O
and O
the O
again O
very O
running O
Rudi B-PER
Bommer I-PER
could O
beat O
the O
leather O
just O
from O
the O
goal O
line O
. O

Breathe O
and O
praise O
. O

Stein B-PER
did O
so O
in O
his O
way O
: O

A O
slap O
on O
the O
butt O
of O
the O
former O
Aschaffenburger B-MISC
, O
then O
commending O
words O
about O
his O
" O
very O
good O
performance O
" O
. O

The O
Frankfurters B-MISC
would O
have O
had O
to O
win O
even O
higher O
on O
this O
day O
. O

Especially O
leg B-PER
offered O
itself O
three O
times O
the O
opportunity O
to O
increase O
. O

The O
next O
thing O
was O
only O
Yeboah B-PER
. O

His O
shot O
from O
20 O
meters O
, O
however O
, O
only O
clapped O
against O
the O
post O
, O
after O
the O
changed O
Stefan B-PER
Studer I-PER
had O
unreservedly O
wrapped O
the O
ball O
in O
a O
promising O
position O
. O

Symptomatic O
for O
harmony B-ORG
. O
" O

The O
team O
is O
playful O
, O
it O
does O
not O
stick O
to O
the O
tasks O
. O

But O
I O
like O
her O
and O
she O
likes O
me O
so O
" O
, O
Stepanovic B-PER
tried O
to O
bring O
the O
recklessness O
of O
his O
men O
into O
a O
better O
light O
. O

At O
the O
latest O
at O
this O
time O
the O
game O
had O
run O
. O

For O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O

our O
goalkeeper O
Vogler B-PER
, O
but O
that O
seems O
to O
be O
settled O
after O
the O
last O
two O
games O
. O
" O

Trainer O
Wulf B-PER
gives O
further O
reasons O
for O
the O
wrong O
start O
: O

" O
We O
had O
to O
install O
six O
new O
players O
, O
which O
takes O
his O
time O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
performers O
such O
as O
Schröder B-PER
and O
Feyen B-PER
were O
long O
injured O
, O
and O
the O
great O
talent O
Michael B-PER
Sauer I-PER
has O
been O
confused O
by O
the O
many O
contacts O
with O
Bundesliga B-MISC
players I-MISC
rather O
than O
built O
up O
. O
" O

These O
arguments O
may O
explain O
the O
misstart O
this O
season O
, O
but O
there O
are O
other O
questions O
: O

How O
is O
it O
that O
despite O
prominent O
newcomers O
in O
the O
last O
three O
years O
the O
SV B-ORG
woes O
regularly O
disappointed O
among O
five O
different O
trainers O
? O

What O
are O
the O
reasons O
why O
players O
promoted O
by O
the O
Bundesliga B-MISC
, O
such O
as O
Schröder B-PER
, O
Feyen B-PER
, O
Sauer B-PER
or O
Caic B-PER
, O
have O
stagnated O
in O
their O
performance O
since O
they O
were O
in O
SV B-ORG
labor O
? O

The O
reasons O
for O
this O
must O
probably O
be O
searched O
in O
the O
structures O
of O
the O
association O
. O

Woe O
has O
risen O
from O
the O
A O
- O
Class O
to O
the O
Oberliga O
in O
an O
unprecedented O
march O
from O
1986 O
to O
1989 O
and O
has O
maintained O
structures O
that O
have O
proven O
themselves O
in O
the O
lower O
classes O
but O
have O
to O
be O
checked O
for O
an O
ascent O
aspirant O
of O
the O
Oberliga O
. O

So O
some O
players O
who O
have O
changed O
from O
other O
clubs O
after O
labor O
complain O
about O
that O
it O
is O
too O
rural O
, O
too O
family O
and O
too O
cozy O
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
you O
get O
used O
to O
the O
casual O
trot O
and O
feel O
quite O
comfortable O
in O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere O
. O

Karlheinz B-PER
Kühn I-PER
admits O
that O
the O
team O
is O
sometimes O
satisfied O
too O
quickly O
: O

" O
After O
the O
cup O
match O
against O
the O
Eintracht B-ORG
there O
was O
an O
almost O
exuberant O
mood O
in O
our O
team O
, O
although O
she O
should O
have O
noticed O
with O
more O
self O
- O
criticism O
that O
she O
has O
not O
delivered O
the O
Eintracht B-ORG
any O
hard O
fight O
. O
" O

As O
not O
optimal O
is O
considered O
by O
some O
players O
also O
medical O
care O
. O

It O
is O
co O
- O
responsible O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
15 O
serious O
injuries O
occurred O
last O
season O
. O

Astonishment O
must O
also O
be O
, O
that O
Wochen O
as O
the O
only O
top O
club O
of O
the O
Oberliga O
trains O
only O
three O
times O
a O

. O

The O
Offenbachers B-MISC
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
train O
five O
to O
six O
times O
a O

. O

Possibly O
also O
the O

model O
, O
to O
offer O
players O
in O
the O
operation O
of O
Hankammer B-PER
a O
good O
professional O
perspective O
, O
a O
treacherous O
trap O
. O

Will O

( O

Heinz B-PER
Hankammer I-PER
has O
also O
come O
to O
ponder O
on O
such O
questions O
. O

On O
Sunday O
morning O
he O
explained O
to O
the O
FR B-ORG
: O

" O
I O
have O
discovered O
a O
certain O
phlegma O
in O
the O
team O
and O
am O
correspondingly O
angry O
. O

I O
will O
discuss O
all O
the O
problems O
openly O
with O
the O
team O
at O
a O
meal O
. O

But O
one O
thing O
seems O
to O
me O
to O
be O
certain O
that O
in O
the O
future O
we O
will O
have O
to O
put O
more O
emphasis O
on O
young O
hungry O
players O

after O
that O
the O

the O

closing O
man O
Ernst B-PER

this O

Shortly O
before O

half O

, O
referee O
Althaus B-LOC
presented O
his O
first O

questionable O

appearance O

both O

Gemeri B-PER
picked O

out O

Not O
out O
remained O
his O

however O

Romeo B-PER

Brechtel B-PER
is O
also O
less O
concerned O
about O
quantities O
than O
about O
qualities O
. O

Because O
the O
ground O
water O
, O
he O
says O
, O
has O
already O
become O
worse O
. O

The O
forest O
hydrologist O
clearly O
blames O
the O
pollutants O
. O

They O
come O
over O
the O
rain O
and O
the O
trees O
into O
the O

which O
is O

if O
intact O

an O

This O
ability O
to O
filter O
out O
pollutants O
, O
however O
, O
has O
already O
lost O
the O

especially O
due O
to O

now O
able O

enter O

thus O
the O

without O

. O

The O
waterworks O
will O
soon O
have O
problems O
with O
it O
, O
says O
Brechtel B-PER
. O

His O
advice O
: O

Instead O
of O
putting O
money O
into O
the O
water O
treatment O
then O
necessary O
, O
the O
waterworks O
should O
" O
wisely O
" O
participate O
in O
the O
costs O
of O
limes O
- O
and O
hope O
that O
the O
forest O
as O
a O
water O
producer O
survives O
thanks O
to O
these O
over O
- O
browsing O
measures O
until O
the O

loads O

Three O
tons O
of O
lime O
per O
hectare O
have O
already O
been O
scattered O
in O
parts O
of O
the O
Reinhardswald B-LOC
to O
protect O
the O
soil O
( O
for O
about O
ten O
years O
) O
and O
save O
the O
trees O
into O
the O
next O
millennium O
. O

By O
this O
time O
, O
harmful O
emissions O
would O
have O
to O
be O
drastically O
reduced O
, O
says O
Brechtel B-PER
. O

If O
in O
this O
respect O
" O
not O
finally O
" O
something O
happened O
, O
one O
could O
, O
of O
course O
, O
save O
the O
lime O
of O
the O
forests O
: O

" O
Then O
you O
should O
give O
the O
money O
to O
starving O
children O
immediately O
" O
. O

Those O
who O
worry O
about O
the O
trees O
in O
the O
Reinhardswald B-LOC
due O
to O
the O
planned O
, O
additional O
water O
withdrawals O
, O
the O
expert O
has O
tried O
to O
calm O
down O
. O

In O
the O
Hessian B-MISC
Ried O
the O
oaks O
died O
suddenly O
, O
when O
more O
water O
was O
tapped O
and O
the O
groundwater O
level O
dropped O
from O
two O
meters O
depth O
to O
seven O
meters O
. O

That O
, O
says O
Brechtel B-PER
, O
will O
not O

ended O
with O
a O
performance O
of O
Gustav B-PER
Mahler I-PER
's I-PER
second O
symphony O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
Resurrection B-MISC
Symphony I-MISC
" O
. O

During O
a O
quarter O
year O
, O
61 O
events O
had O
taken O
place O
, O
piano O
evenings O
with O
prominent O
instrumentation O
as O
well O
as O
riverboatshuffles O
on O
the O
Rhine B-LOC
. O

The O
final O
concert O
with O
Mahler B-PER
, O
however O
, O
was O
probably O
the O
most O
important O
accent O
of O
the O
festival O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
former O
principal O
conductor O
of O
the O
Frankfurt B-ORG

, O
Eliahu B-PER
Inbal I-PER
, O
conducted O

Mahler B-PER
's I-PER
second O
symphony O
, O
c O
minor O
, O
a O
gigantic O
piece O
of O
late O
- O
romantic O
symphony O
, O
whose O
performance O
lasts O
just O
under O
one O
and O
a O
half O
hours O
, O
is O
in O
her O
instrumentation O
- O
orchestra O
, O
choir O
and O
solo O
- O
rather O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
symphonic O
cantata O
. O

At O
its O
first O
performance O
in O
1895 O
, O
this O
symphony O
aroused O
fierce O
controversy O
. O

Today O
the O
piece O
is O
one O
of O
Mahler B-PER
's I-PER
more O
popular O
compositions O
, O
probably O
because O
of O
its O
melodic O
" O
rapture O
" O
and O
its O
harmonical O
drama O
- O
a O
symphonist O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
whose O
ultimate O
" O
discovery O
" O
fell O
into O
the O
early O
60s O
of O
our O
century O
. O

At O
that O
time O
they O
were O
talking O
about O
a O
" O
Malter B-MISC
- I-MISC
Eupho I-MISC

In O
the O
context O
of O
the O
interpretative O
sharpness O
, O
with O
which O
Inbal B-PER
made O
the O
monumental O
work O
manageable O
and O
logical O
to O
develop O
, O
it O
was O
above O
all O
the O
vocal O
solos O
of O
Alexandra B-PER
Coku I-PER
and O
Cornelia B-PER
Wulkopf I-PER
, O
which O
guaranteed O
- O
in O
the O
finale O
- O
truly O
iridescent O
, O
linear O
as O
well O
as O
penetrating O
contour O
. O

Especially O
Alexandra B-PER
Coku I-PER
, O
the O
soprano O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
caught O
the O
C O
major O
aura O
in O
the O
huge O
epilogue O
of O
the O
symphony O
textually O
concise O
, O
clear O
and O
in O
exemplary O
intensity O
as O
concentration O
. O

It O
all O
started O
in O
a O
completely O
different O
way O
. O

Inbal B-PER
, O
who O
had O
the O
orchestra O
, O
the O
Prague B-ORG
Symphony O
, O
under O
control O
, O
has O
interpreted O
the O
difficult O
psychology O
in O
the O
head O
movement O
in O
a O
way O
that O
made O
listening O
. O

Since O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
accents O
wandering O
through O
the O
ensemble O
were O
uncoordinated O
, O
the O
line O
peeling O
out O
only O
hesitantly O
: O

An O
irritating O
disposition O
for O
Mahler B-PER
's I-PER
epic O
expanding O
symphony O
. O

This O
came O
at O
first O
only O
dull O
accentuated O
, O
pale O
in O
the O
otherwise O
surrounded O
by O
aura O
string O
substance O
. O

Then O
the O
first O
wind O
signals O
, O
punctual O
, O
precise O
and O
full O
radiation O
: O

That O
was O
conducting O
suggestion O
, O
but O
also O
orchestral O
, O
instrumental O
conciseness O
and O
virtuosity O
. O

Inbal B-PER
drives O
everything O
forward O
incessantly O
. O

The O
eclat O
in O
Tutti O
has O
crystal O
clear O
profile O
, O
but O
next O
to O
it O
also O
stands O
- O
no O
less O
intense O
- O
the O
morbid O
, O
" O
negative O
" O
gesture O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
's O
sweet O
: O

Of O
course O
, O
this O
belongs O
to O
Mahler B-PER
, O
who O
probably O
( O
except O
perhaps O
Richard B-PER
Strauss I-PER
) O
came O
up O
with O
the O
most O
beautiful O
melodies O
of O
the O
tonal O
era O
that O
is O
coming O
to O
an O
end O
. O

That O
ebbs O
, O
shipped O
, O
builds O
up O
- O
plastic O
- O
new O
, O
thus O
has O
a O
clear O
basic O
idea O
. O

Admirable O
was O
also O
the O
rhythmic O
" O
biss O
" O
, O
which O
Inbal B-PER
seems O
to O
make O
the O
leitmotif O
of O
his O
interpretation O
. O

Even O
under O
this O
sense O
the O
performance O
had O
backbone O
. O

Finally O

the O

and O
the O

. O

That O
comes O
, O
so O
it O
wants O
Mahler B-PER
, O
so O
it O
makes O
Inbal B-PER
, O
first O
in O
great O
peace O
, O
hymnal O
and O
a O
touch O
of O
sacrosanct O
. O

In O

Through O

, O
a O

society O
only O

that O
countries O

In O
view O
of O
the O
economic O
and O
political O
pressure O
in O
their O
home O
countries O
, O
which O
are O
often O
intertwined O
, O
some O

decide O

in O
Langendienbach B-LOC

The O
increasing O
racism O

not O
politically O

Political O
or O
sociologists O
would O
have O
to O
address O
this O
issue O
: O

" O
This O
is O
a O
fundamental O
fear O
of O
the O
population O
because O
many O
things O
are O
changing O
as O
rapidly O
as O
the O
economy O
or O

. O
" O

The O
existence O
of O
xenophobia O
is O
often O
a O
mirror O
of O
the O
social O
situation O
, O
" O
Körner B-PER

The O
speaker O
from O
the O
Institute B-ORG
of I-ORG
German I-ORG
Economy I-ORG
, O
Bernd B-PER
Hof I-PER
, O
also O
called O
for O
a O
pedagogical O
approach O

In O
his O

, O
he O
considered O
that O
" O
the O
potential O
for O
migration O
is O
far O
greater O
than O
the O
potential O

" O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
from O
a O
" O
labour O
market O
- O
oriented O
point O
of O
view O
" O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
German B-MISC
economy O
is O
dependent O
on O
foreign O
workers O
. O

The O
" O

are O

the O
Federal O

of O

its O
" O

Without O
them O
, O

have O
been O
able O
to O
draw O
on O
four O
million O
fewer O
workers O
over O
the O
past O
30 O

. O

The O
potential O
for O
long O

, O
according O
to O
the O
Hofs B-PER

, O
is O
not O

During O

at O

Kleinschmidt B-PER
to O
object O
, O
but O
changed O
his O
mind O
after O
a O
thinking O
process O
and O
got O
out O
two O
days O
before O
the O

. O

In O
the O
short O
term O
, O
the O
predecessor O
Krauses B-PER
, O
Peter B-PER

The O

the O
question O
of O

no O
absolute O
backing O
in O

to O
the O
obligation O
of O
Jörg B-PER
Kleinschmidt I-PER
, O
who O
was O
not O
undisputed O
in O

he O
resigned O
from O

Becker B-PER
, O
however O
, O
wants O

What O

The O

probably O
no O

more O
optimistic O
in O
this O
sector O
: O

" O
Maybe O
he O
'll O
be O
back O
in O
the O
second O
round O
. O
" O

Krause B-PER
is O
facing O
various O
tests O
. O

Maybe O
the O
Kleinschmidt B-PER
thing O
did O
n't O
even O
come O
to O
him O
inconvenient O
. O

Soon O
he O
still O
wants O
to O
move O
to O
Anspach B-LOC
to O
establish O
himself O
there O
professionally O

After O
a O

shock O
in O

the O

to O

The O
leaflet O
recently O
read O
, O
clever O
agrarian O
economists O
had O
organized O
to O
the O
shameful O
amusement O
of O
the O
audience O
pig O
races O
, O
which O
naturally O
chased O
the O
honorable O
guild B-ORG
of I-ORG
animal I-ORG
protectors I-ORG
on O
the O
palm O
. O

For O
our O
own O
, O
however O
, O
it O
may O
be O
stated O
whether O
the O
German B-MISC
domestic O
pig O
praised O
as O
intelligently O
is O
more O
nimble O
to O
Huf O
than O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
French B-MISC
Périgord B-MISC
pig I-MISC
. O

Because O
the O
two O
relevant O
racing O
games O
bring O
at O
most O
the O
player O
, O
but O
no O
boar O
in O
stress O
and O
therefore O
call O
also O
no O
animal O
welfare O
club O
on O
the O
plan O
. O

The O
SWINE B-MISC
RENNE I-MISC
proves O
once O
again O
how O
diverse O
playing O
material O
can O
be O
. O

As O
game O
characters O
, O
each O
of O
the O
two O
to O
four O
players O
gets O
two O
fat O
, O
bally O
savings O
boxes O
and O
a O
few O
gold O
coins O
that O
he O
can O
distribute O
to O
Gusto O
on O
the O
two O
piglets O
. O

There O
are O
symbols O
spread O
over O
the O
game O
plan O
. O

Since O
you O
can O
pick O
up O
gold O
coins O
on O
the O
way O
and O
plug O
them O
into O
any O
pig O
- O
of O
course O
your O
own O
. O

Or O
there O
's O
black O
bad O
luck O
Thaler O
. O

You O
can O
also O
put O
them O
in O
any O
pig O
- O
of O
course O
an O
opponent O
. O

And O
finally O
, O
the O
pig O
picture O
allows O
to O
take O
any O
saving O
can O
from O
the O
plan O
, O
to O
hold O
to O
the O
ear O
and O
shake O
. O

So O
you O
can O
determine O
which O
competitive O
piglet O
wants O
to O
run O
with O
thick O
belly O
into O
the O
finish O
, O
to O
feed O
it O
on O
the O
way O
still O
neatly O
with O
pitch O
- O
thalers O
. O

The O
movements O
determine O
a O
cube O
that O
has O
only O
eyes O
from O
1 O
to O
3 O
. O

The O
savings O
cans O
do O
not O
displace O
each O
other O
from O
the O
plan O
. O

When O
a O
field O
is O
occupied O
, O
it O
is O
simply O
not O
counted O
and O
skipped O
. O

That O
's O
why O
it O
says O
, O
with O
the O
second O
pig O
always O
stay O
pretty O
at O
the O
pack O
. O

Anyone O
who O
is O
once O
abandoned O
, O
no O
longer O
comes O
forward O
quickly O
, O
because O
he O
can O
not O
constantly O
hop O
over O
others O
. O

In O
the O
target O
there O
are O
again O
bonuses O
. O

Then O
will O
be O
billed O
. O

For O
each O
black O
coin O
a O
gold O
is O
lost O
. O

It O
wins O
of O
course O
, O
who O
could O
drag O
the O
fattest O
prey O
into O
the O
target O
. O

In O
the O
well O
- O
understood O
rule O
is O
a O
" O
tip O
" O
included O
. O

After O
that O
it O
is O
allowed O
to O
exchange O
the O
colored O
cap O
of O
the O
savings O
boxes O
with O
those O
of O
the O
fellow O
player O
, O
so O
that O
each O
can O
distinguish O
its O
two O
cans O
. O

But O
that O
kills O
the O
game O
. O

If O
both O
figures O
look O
the O
same O
, O
it O
is O
much O
harder O
to O
remember O
which O
counter O
- O
pig O
is O
specifically O
fed O
and O
which O
is O
only O
dragged O
along O
. O

The O
title O
SCHWEINSGALOPP B-MISC
sounds O
similar O
, O
but O
the O
game O
is O
completely O
different O
. O

The O
highly O
enjoyable O
graphic O
is O
child O
- O
friendly O
and O
misdirects O
as O
well O
as O
the O
age O
indication O
six O
to O
twelve O
years O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
children O
in O
this O
age O
band O
can O
play O
this O
game O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
also O
an O
unrecognized O
and O
in O
this O
camouflage O
also O
almost O
undetectable O
racer O
for O
adults O
. O

The O
SCHWEINSGALOPP B-MISC
has O
meanwhile O
established O
itself O
with O
us O
as O
a O
constant O
fast O
" O
intermediate O
game O
" O
and O
triggers O
enthusiasm O
with O
everyone O
who O
gets O
to O
know O
it O
. O

The O
plan O
shows O
a O
round O
course O
without O
start O
and O
finish O

On O
it O
you O
place O
in O
any O
order O
completely O
five O
colorful O
racing O
pigs O
. O

They O
're O
cast O
out O
of O
solid O
plastic O
, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
be O
damned O
careful O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
children O
. O

Otherwise O
they O
are O
guaranteed O
to O
be O
missing O
in O
the O
playbox O
and O
wander O
in O
trouser O
pockets O
or O
into O
the O
box O
with O

Each O
player O
gets O
seven O
cards O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
different O
forage O
stamps O
, O
one O
is O
looking O
for O
an O
interpretation O
for O
the O
graphics O
. O

But O
it O
's O
all O
much O
easier O
: O

Chip O
is O
chip O
, O
and O
with O
the O
cards O
counts O
only O
the O
background O
color O
. O

Whoever O
's O
on O
the O
move O
, O
discards O
a O
card O
and O
moves O
the O
pig O
of O
this O
color O
. O

So O
it O
does O
n't O
belong O
to O
any O
player O
a O
certain O
figure O
. O

Everyone O
can O
pull O
any O
sow O
. O

As O
with O
SWINE B-MISC
RINGING I-MISC
, O
fields O
occupied O
here O
are O
not O
counted O
either O
. O

A O
pig O
simply O
goes O
a O
field O
before O
, O
and O
if O
others O
stand O
in O
the O
way O
, O
so O
they O
are O
skipped O
. O

If O
the O
straight O
- O
moving O
sow O
lands O
with O
her O
train O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
pack O
, O
she O
is O
offered O
a O
feed O
chip O
as O
a O
reward O
. O

The O
player O
takes O
a O
food O
disc O
and O
puts O
it O
in O
front O
of O
him O
. O

But O
it O
does O
n't O
belong O
to O
him O
yet O
. O

The O
round O
is O
fast O
to O
the O
end O
, O
because O
everyone O
can O
play O
only O
seven O
cards O
. O

The O
trick O
is O
on O
the O
last O
train O
. O

Only O
when O
it O
succeeds O
in O
putting O
a O
pig O
to O
the O
top O
, O
the O
food O
points O
collected O
until O
then O
are O
secured O
. O

Three O
rounds O
are O
played O
, O
which O
does O
not O
take O
ten O
minutes O
for O
experienced O
players O
. O

The O
joke O
of O
the O
game O
lies O
in O
tearing O
the O
closed O
pop O
of O
pigs O
by O
moving O
figures O
from O
the O
middle O
. O

This O
will O
force O
the O
players O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the O
top O
field O
, O
which O
costs O
cards O
without O
inserting O
chips O
. O

But O
you O
can O
speculate O
so O
badly O
. O

Eh O
' O
you O
know O
, O
exactly O
the O
sow O
that O
fits O
to O
the O
last O
card O
, O
is O
suspended O
and O
isolated O
. O

And O
some O
co O
- O
player O
notes O
in O
a O
hesitant O
way O
: O

Do O
you O
already O
have O
a O
hobby O
? O

Illustrate O
animal O
traces O

In O
the O
past O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
detect O
and O
interpret O
animal O
traces O
was O
vital O
for O
people O
, O
after O
all O
, O
it O
often O
depended O
on O
the O
success O
of O
hunting O
or O
survival O
. O

Nowadays O
it O
is O
still O
important O
for O
hunters O
and O
foresters O
to O
be O
able O
to O
read O
tracks O
so O
as O
to O
properly O
assess O
the O
game O
stock O
. O

In O
our O
time O
it O
is O
important O
for O
the O
protection O
of O
wildlife O
that O
as O
many O
people O
as O
possible O
also O
have O
knowledge O
about O
their O
habits O
- O
because O
who O
can O
interpret O
animal O
traces O
, O
learns O
many O
behaviors O
of O
the O
animals O
. O

He O
can O
therefore O
also O
take O
more O
account O
of O
the O
needs O
of O
wildlife O
than O
someone O
who O
runs O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
" O
blind O
" O
through O
forest O
and O
hallway O
. O

The O
tracking O
can O
become O
an O
interesting O
hobby O
, O
where O
you O
can O
also O
do O
something O
for O
your O
health O
. O

While O
one O
often O
during O
a O
walk O
through O
forest O
and O
field O
except O
some O
birds O
and O
insects O
did O
not O
discover O
another O
animal O
, O
because O
most O
mammals O
twilight O
or O
. O

Nocturnal O
and O
shy O
, O
however O
, O
reveal O
to O
the O
client O
signs O
and O
traces O
that O
animals O
have O
left O
, O
a O
lot O
about O
their O
presence O
and O
behavior O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
squirrels O
: O

Young O
squirrels O
first O
need O
to O
learn O
to O
crack O
a O
nut O
properly O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
rodent O
traces O
of O
hazelnuts O
reveal O
whether O
a O
young O
, O
inexperienced O
or O
an O
old O
, O
routine O
animal O
has O
tried O
as O
a O
nutcracker O
. O

Frozen O
traces O
of O
birds O
on O
fruit O
are O
clearly O
visible O
from O
the O
pick O
tracks O
. O

Thrushes O
hollow O
out O
apples O
by O
picking O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
bowl O
and O
then O
extracting O
the O
flesh O
, O
spruce O
cones O
, O
however O
, O
are O
less O
interested O
in O
the O
flesh O
, O
but O
only O
for O
the O
kernels O
. O

A O
walk O
in O
the O
forest O
can O
be O
quite O
exciting O
with O
such O
knowledge O

But O
also O
the O

At O

While O
the O

from O

, O
the O
FSV B-ORG

from O
its O

the O

of O

thrown O
by O
a O

Rules O
for O
taking O
medications O

Many O
rheumatism O
drugs O
, O
but O
also O
drugs O
for O
constipation O
, O
enzyme O
preparations O
and O
some O
pills O
for O
depression O
are O
offered O
to O
patients O
in O
a O
special O
form O
: O

which O
are O
surrounded O
by O
a O
" O
magic O
- O
resistant O
" O
protective O
cover O
. O

This O
means O
that O
such O
drugs O
only O
dissolve O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
and O
from O
there O
fully O
develop O
their O
active O
substances O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
is O
also O
the O
consideration O
that O
the O
aggressive O
gastric O
juice O
should O
not O
affect O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
preparation O
and O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
stomach O
mucosa O
should O
not O
come O
into O
contact O
with O
the O
ingredients O
of O
the O
drug O
. O

In O
general O
, O
" O
magic O
- O
resistant O
" O
or O
" O
thin O
- O
intestinal O
- O
soluble O
" O
medicines O
have O
so O
far O
mostly O
been O
the O
rule O
of O
taking O
the O
dose O
prescribed O
by O
the O
doctor O
to O
slucco O
along O
with O
the O
food O
. O

Recent O
studies O
by O
gastroenterologists O
( O
gastro O
- O
intestinal O
specialists O
) O
show O
, O
however O
, O
that O
this O
is O
obviously O
quite O
wrong O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
controls O
showed O
that O
medications O
would O
remain O
in O
the O
stomach O
much O
longer O
if O
taken O
together O
with O
food O
. O

The O
dragees O
or O
capsules O
surrounded O
by O
a O
protective O
cover O
( O
also O
known O
as O
retard O
preparations O
with O
long O
- O
term O
effects O
) O
remain O
as O
indigestible O
in O
the O
stomach O
and O
therefore O
do O
not O
get O
into O
the O
intestines O
with O
the O
food O
porridge O
pre O
- O
digested O
by O
the O
gastric O
juice O
. O

It O
is O
particularly O
unfavorable O
to O
press O
in O
a O
short O
time O
( O
less O
than O
two O
hours O
) O
after O
a O
main O
meal O
with O
simultaneous O
medication O
a O
small O
snack O
. O

The O
digestion O
of O
these O
foods O
then O
has O
another O
priority O
and O
the O
medicines O
that O
are O
unopened O
by O
the O
gastric O
juice O
may O
remain O
in O
the O
stomach O
for O
up O
to O
twelve O
hours O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
, O
the O
painstakingly O
taken O
medications O
in O
the O
stomach O
can O
literally O
stow O
up O
and O
clump O
together O
, O
because O
with O
the O
following O
main O
meals O
the O
next O
dose O
is O
usually O
swallowed O
. O

Tricking O
the O
stomach O
with O
its O
digestive O
movements O
can O
only O
be O
done O
by O
eating O
nothing O
at O
all O
for O
more O
than O
two O
hours O
. O

Then O
the O
stomach O
finally O
transports O
the O
remaining O
drugs O
to O
where O
they O
belong O
- O
to O
the O
small O
intestine O
. O

But O
how O
can O
such O
intake O
margins O
be O
prevented O
, O
which O
disturb O
the O
treatment O
and O
sometimes O
even O
prevent O
its O
success O
? O

According O
to O
the O
latest O
medical O
advice O
, O
so O
- O
called O
gastro O
- O
resistant O
, O
thin O
intestine O
soluble O
drugs O
are O
better O
taken O
in O
the O
morning O
sober O
and O
during O
the O
day O
between O
meals O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
between O
the O
main O
meals O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
the O
stomach O
will O
no O
longer O
hold O
on O
to O
the O
medicines O
that O
are O
indigestible O
to O
it O
. O

Products O
taken O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
reach O
the O
small O
intestine O
within O
70 O
minutes O
at O
the O
latest O
. O

Note O
also O
the O
natural O
rhythm O
of O
gastric O
activity O
: O

At O
night O
this O
organ O
rests O
, O
and O
medications O
with O
depot O
effect O
remain O
as O
well O
as O
other O
indigestible O
or O
severely O
digestible O
food O
until O
the O
stomach O
resumes O
its O
digestive O
work O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

Attention O
should O
also O
be O
paid O
to O
taking O
medications O
always O
standing O
and O
taking O
them O
with O
plenty O
of O
fluid O
. O

They O
then O
slide O
better O
and O
do O
not O
get O
stuck O
halfway O
in O
the O
esophagus O
. O

Since O
these O
intake O
recommendations O
correspond O
to O
the O
latest O
medical O
findings O
, O
they O
are O
generally O
not O
yet O
well O

Scandal O

Since O
plans O
for O
the O
establishment O
of O

are O
repeatedly O
delayed O
by O
a O
" O
storm O
of O

and O

according O

Thomas B-PER
Schimpff I-PER

" O

In O

The O

criminal B-ORG

had O
recently O
arrested O
criminal O
garbage O
executors O
who O
did O
not O

special O

as O
contractually O
agreed O

brought O
it O

were O
supposed O
to O
have O
filled O

used O
it O
in O

If O

it O
is O
not O

that O

Herbert B-PER
Dörenberg I-PER
on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
Robert B-PER
Jung I-PER
on O
the O
other O
, O
emphasized O
before O
the O
game O
how O
meaningful O
the O
Derby O
was O
for O
the O
further O
season O
. O

The O
clear O
lead O
of O
the O
Offenbachers B-MISC
still O
greatly O
oppresses O
the O
fellow O
favorites O
, O
and O
accordingly O
both O
teams O
seemed O
tense O
as O
well O
. O

The O
FSV B-ORG
would O
have O
earned O
the O
victory O
after O
ninety O
minutes O
, O
the O
goalless O
draw O
will O
not O
help O
both O

any O
further O
. O

For O
some O
confusion O
and O
for O
the O
biggest O
stir O
in O
the O
initial O
phase O
, O
the O
" O
false O
" O
jersey O
colors O
of O
the O
two O
local O
rivals O
were O
first O
created O
. O

While O
the O
Bockenheimers B-MISC
appeared O
in O
blue O
, O
the O
FSV B-ORG
played O
in O
the O
traditional O
colors O
red O
- O
white O
of O
the O
guests O
. O

And O
like O
a O
guest O
team O
the O
FSV B-ORG
played O
at O
first O
as O
well O
. O

The O
Bockenheimers B-MISC
determined O
the O
game O
in O
the O
first O
half O
hour O
, O
combined O
better O
and O
had O
after O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
also O
by O
a O
flat O
shot O
of O
Björn B-PER
Pistauer I-PER
, O
who O
hissed O
one O
meter O
past O
the O
FSV B-MISC
gate I-MISC
, O
the O
first O
big O
chance O
. O

Notable O
was O
how O
much O
room O
the O
FSV B-ORG
, O
which O
seemed O
strangely O
unsettled O
, O
left O
the O
guests O
. O

Then O
the O
FSV B-ORG
also O
had O
to O
change O
, O
because O
Ralf B-PER
Zgraja I-PER
after O
28 O
minutes O
already O
injured O
himself O
so O
badly O
that O
he O
had O
to O
be O
exchanged O
. O

For O
him O
, O
Michael B-PER
Sandt I-PER
, O
whom O
FSVTrainer B-MISC
Dörenberg B-PER
described O
as O
his O
model O
student O
, O
took O
over O
the O
man O
cover O
against O
Michael B-PER
Rexroth I-PER
. O

Nine O
minutes O
later O
came O
the O
next O
blow O
for O
the O
FSV B-ORG
: O

After O
a O
harmless O
duel O
with O
Thomas B-PER
Hoßmang I-PER
, O
Marco B-PER
Grevelhörster I-PER
got O
the O
time O
penalty O
raised O
by O
the O
petty O
referee O
. O

But O
with O
ten O
men O
the O
FSV B-ORG
finally O
showed O
the O
bite O
, O
which O
had O
been O
missed O
until O
then O
, O
and O
reached O
by O
Collins B-PER
Etebu I-PER
the O
first O
chance O
shortly O
before O
the O
change O
, O
but O
also O
this O
shot O
attempt O
remained O
stuck O
in O
the O
Red B-MISC
White I-MISC
defense I-MISC
. O

Thanks O
to O
referee O
Steudter B-PER
, O
who O
already O
in O
the O
first O
45 O
minutes O
distributed O
four O
yellow O
cards O
and O
a O
time O
penalty O
, O
there O
was O
at O
least O
a O
bit O
of O
talk O
material O
during O
the O
break O
. O

Until O
then O
, O
the O
game O
itself O
has O
provided O
little O
reason O
for O
discussion O
. O

After O
the O
change O
, O
the O
FSV B-ORG
became O
stronger O
, O
especially O
the O
nimble O
Grevelhörster B-PER
was O
a O
constant O
source O
of O
unrest O
in O
the O
red O
and O
white B-MISC
cover I-MISC
. O

The O
biggest O
chance O
of O
the O
game O
, O
however O
, O
was O
the O
" O
Red B-ORG
" O
: O

Oliver B-PER
Roth I-PER
came O
free O
to O
the O
headball O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
second O
half O
after O
a O
precise O
flank O
of O
Rexroth B-PER
, O
however O
- O
fortunately O
for O
his O
former O
club O
- O
over O
the O
latte O
. O

Shortly O
afterwards O
, O
Roth B-PER
again O
failed O
to O
FSVSchlossmann B-MISC
Marcus B-PER
Croonen I-PER
, O
and O
FSVTrainer B-MISC
Dörenberg B-PER
became O
more O
and O
more O
excited O
on O
the O
outside O

At O
Red B-ORG

the O

Hoßmang B-PER
brought O
calm O

FSV B-ORG
in O
the O

Ivan B-PER

In O

the O

the O

The O
measure O
was O

taken O
to O
prevent O

from O

, O
' O
recalls O
the O

But O
since O

We O
also O

a O

it O
