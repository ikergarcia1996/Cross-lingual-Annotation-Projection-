every O

with O
an O
equal O
" O

that O

and O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
this O
global O
principle O
of O
equality O
, O
it O
calculates O
for O
the O
citizens O
of O

that O
they O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
considers O
it O
possible O
in O
many O
areas O
of O

just O
by O

the O

difficult O

lengthy O
task O
to O
move O
the O
majority O
of O
the O

to O

The O
question O
is O
how O

can O
be O
realized O

can O
be O
exercised O
with O

also O

In O
contrast O

which O
is O
aimed O
solely O
at O
price O

quality O

, O
they O
are O
concerned O
about O
the O
consequences O
of O
purchase O
and O
consumption O
, O
in O
critical O
cases O
they O
also O
plead O
for O
boycott O
. O

The O
first O
step O
was O
to O
make O
environmental O
compatibility O
the O
purchase O
criterion O
. O

The O
consumer O
movement O
in O
the O
United O
States B-LOC

already O
included O

Thus O
, O
a O
public O

forced O

When O
Nippon B-LOC
Finance O
Minister O
Tsutomu B-PER
Hata I-PER
announcing O
on O
TV O
his O
“ O
emergency O
package O
” O
, O
most O
experts O
smiled O
only O
softly O
. O

Once O
again O
a O
program O
that O
only O
treats O
the O
symptoms O
of O
stock O
market O
weakness O
, O
but O
not O
the O
disease O
of O
the O
stock O
market O
" O
, O
it O
was O
called O
. O

But O
last O
week O
’s O
price O
explosion O
stunned O
many O
critics O
. O

It O
is O
surely O
too O
early O
to O
see O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
capital O
market O
again O
from O
the O
tailor O
. O

Two O
prerequisites O
for O
this O
are O
essential O
: O

Corporate O
profits O
must O
not O
continue O
to O
fall O
, O
and O
financial O
institutions O
must O
find O
a O
practical O
solution O
to O
manage O
their O
critical O
loans O
. O

There O
are O
probably O
still O
considerable O
doubts O
on O
both O
points O
at O
present O
. O

Surveys O
clearly O
show O
that O
the O
industry O
needs O
to O
correct O
its O
earnings O
expectations O
further O
downwards O
for O
the O
current O
year O
, O
after O
severe O
losses O
were O
already O
reduced O
in O
1991 O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
the O
successful O
electronics O
companies O
fear O
further O
breakthroughs O
. O

The O
Japanese B-MISC
metal O
industry O
is O
even O
more O
troubled O
. O

Nippon B-ORG
Steel I-ORG
, O
for O
example O
, O
expects O
a O
profit O
drop O
of O
60 O
percent O
. O

As O
long O
as O
nobody O
knows O
whether O
it O
really O
has O
already O
crossed O
the O
valley O
floor O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
hope O
rules O
. O

Tokyo B-LOC
obviously O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
leave O
alone O
anymore O
. O

Given O
the O
depressed O
mood O
, O
Finance O
Minister O
Hata B-PER
did O
not O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
offer O
his O
colleagues O
a O
costly O
twelve O
- O
point O
bailout O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
to O
be O
done O
is O
to O
restore O
confidence O
in O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
banking O
system O
, O
according O
to O
his O
reasoning O
for O
the O
official O
generosity O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
government O
urges O
banks O
, O
insurance O
and O
land O
companies O
to O
form O
a O
joint O
real O
estate O
fund O
with O
state O
aid O
. O

With O
the O
money O
from O
this O
could O
be O
financed O
the O
purchase O
of O
those O
properties O
, O
which O
are O
now O
practically O
hanging O
in O
the O
air O
as O
collateral O
for O
bank O
loans O
. O

We O
are O
talking O
about O
a O
minimum O
necessary O
sum O
of O
35 O
billion O
marks O
. O

How O
the O
Monopoly B-MISC
game I-MISC
should O
proceed O
, O
remains O
only O
in O
the O
dark O
. O

However O
, O
one O
thing O
is O
already O
clear O
today O
. O

In O
view O
of O
the O
high O
- O
pressure O
real O
estate O
market O
and O
the O
empty O
cash O
registers O
of O
institutional O
investors O
, O
only O
the O
state O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
potential O
land O
buyer O
. O

The O
taxpayer O
is O
condemned O
to O
pay O
the O
bill O
for O
the O
unprecedented O
soil O
speculation O
of O
the O
1980s O
. O

But O
that O
is O
not O
enough O
generosity O
. O

The O
stock O
market O
shock O
moved O
Nippon B-LOC
’s I-LOC
nervous O
government O
to O
make O
further O
concessions O
. O

Thus O
, O
banks O
are O
allowed O
to O
update O
their O
balance O
sheets O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
recognised O
by O
the O
state O
. O

With O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Finance O
, O
the O
write O
- O
off O
of O
their O
share O
losses O
will O
be O
postponed O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
current O
fiscal O
year O
on O
March O
31 O
, O
1993 O
and O
will O
thus O
disappear O
from O
the O
books O
first O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
institutions O
of O
their O
clients O
may O
in O
future O
borrow O
money O
at O
interest O
rates O
, O
which O
are O
below O
the O
discount O
rate O
of O
currently O
3.25 O
percent O
. O

The O
government O
is O
still O
feeding O
this O
subversion O
of O
monetary O
policy O
with O
tax O
exemptions O
. O

that O

belong O

also O
automatically O

it O
turns O

no O

but O
after O

they O
would O
actually O
be O
back O

This O
has O
led O
, O
since O
the O
announcement O
that O
Sutter B-PER
will O
lay O
down O
his O
mandate O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O

to O
hectic O
reviews O

Would O
the O
Red B-MISC

Green I-MISC

now O
dismiss O
Sutter B-PER
post O
- O
retirementally O
( O
and O
thus O
give O

Would O
they O
even O
let O
the O

So O
far O
the O
red B-MISC

love O
of O

not O

Such O

" O
says O
government O

Erich B-PER

, O
who O
otherwise O
can O
not O
yet O
say O
what O
solution O
will O
now O
be O
found O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
it O
should O
be O
one O
that O
would O
then O
also O
apply O
to O
the O
other O
four O
vacationed O
CDU B-MISC
state I-MISC
secretaries I-MISC
one O

. O

After O
the O
quick O
farewell O
statements O
for O
Mr O
Sutter B-PER
, O
the O
State O
Secretary O
Sutter B-PER
must O
therefore O
be O
discussed O
again O
this O
week O
among O
all O
the O
parties O
involved O
. O

The O
Secretary O
of O
State O
has O
a O
half O
- O
year O
decision O
- O
making O
period O
after O
the O
resignation O
of O
the O
Member O
of O
Parliament O
anyway O
. O

Then O
he O
can O
either O
apply O
to O
become O
Secretary O
of O
State O
again O
( O
which O
would O
force O
the O
red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
government O
to O
decide O
) O
. O

Because O
he O
already O
works O
in O
Bonn B-LOC
, O
this O
is O
unlikely O
. O

Or O
he O
asks O
for O
the O
dismissal O
himself O
, O
whereby O
he O
would O
have O
pension O
claims O
only O
in O
old O
age O
, O
the O
75 O
percent O
for O
immediately O
fell O
away O
. O

But O
even O
that O
is O
grey O
, O
far O
too O
simple O
theory O
: O

In O
this O
case O
( O
fortunately O
for O
Sutter B-PER
) O
it O
is O
actually O
not O
about O
75 O
percent O
, O
but O
only O
less O
than O
ten O
percent O
: O

The O
49 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
was O
long O
years O
administrative O
officer O
, O
associate O
member O
of O
the O
German B-ORG
District I-ORG
Council I-ORG
and O
from O
1987 O
to O
1989 O
Social O
Dean O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC

There O
he O
had O
been O
elected O
in O
1987 O
for O
six O
years O
until O
1993 O
and O
thus O
had O
even O
as O
a O
member O
of O
the O
parliament O
still O
ongoing O
provisions O
from O
funds O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
of I-LOC
Frankfurt I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
why O
he O
accordingly O
dealt O
with O
fewer O
parliamentary O
offices O
: O

a O
truly O
impenetrable O
thickness O
. O

At O
any O
rate O
, O
he O
has O
claimed O
a O
high O
pension O
( O
Sutter B-PER
) O
, O
which O
is O
already O
more O
than O
60 O
percent O
of O
his O
last O
active O
salary O
. O

After O
an O
amendment O
to O
the O
Bonner B-MISC
legislation O
that O
came O
into O
force O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
, O
he O
will O
eventually O
- O
probably O
- O
also O
have O
his O
income O
in O
the O
dual O
system O
to O
be O
added O
to O
such O
pension O
claims O
, O
which O
excludes O
double O
deductions O
on O
an O
earlier O
scale O
. O

Now O
the O
specialist O
lawyers O
check O
who O
has O
to O
pay O
what O
when O
- O
if O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State O
Sutter B-PER
has O
managed O
to O
follow O
the O
Member O
of O
Parliament O
Sutter B-PER
to O
Bonn B-LOC
. O

And O
even O
the O
most O
experienced O
among O
them O
openly O
admit O
that O

had O
not O

solved O
such O
a O

The O

brought O
only O

Hopes O

The O
bonus O

the O

largely O

Now O
they O

just O
three O

At O

Now O

The O
once O
Soviet B-MISC

now O
Russian B-MISC
army O
still O

in O
the O

And O
the O
Baltics B-LOC
must O
dispense O
with O
the O
shielding O
from O
the O
West I-LOC

because O
it O
once O

not O

This O
is O
how O
the O
Baltic B-MISC

feel O
one O
year O

Instead O

there O
is O
a O

The O

But O
the O
scale O
with O
which O
one O

not O
apply O

Is O
that O

I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
your O
assessment O
of O
the O
usefulness O
of O
the O
new O
city O
cycling O
route O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
bike O
lane O
is O
used O
as O
anything O
else O
( O
e.g. O
as O
a O
parking O
lane O
) O
, O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
can O
be O
observed O
in O
almost O
every O
not O
perfect O
" O
scattered O
" O
bike O
lane O
in O

This O
should O
be O
a O
reason O
to O
work O
hard O
and O
otherwise O
use O
the O
bike O
lane O
vigorously O
. O

Secondly O
, O
I O
can O
understand O
anyone O
who O
, O
because O
he O
does O
not O
have O
the O
necessary O
responsiveness O
or O
experience O
for O
such O
a O
kind O
of O
road O
, O
makes O
a O
big O
bow O
around O
this O
crossing O
, O
even O
better O
around O
the O
whole O
road O
. O

Is O
n't O
the O
problem O
rather O
that O
it O
goes O
deeply O
against O
the O
car O
driver O
's O
soul O
to O
allow O
a O
cyclist O
to O
drive O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
way O
as O
is O
still O
half O

way O
common O

The O

you O

In O
the O

of O
the O
Islamic B-MISC

, O
which O
at O
the O
time O
appeared O
to O
me O
at O
the O
level O
of O
concrete O
interpersonal O

what O
I O
experienced O
during O
the O
journey O
from O

very O

the O

most O
friendly O
and O
open O
people O
- O
as O
far O
as O
one O
can O
judge O
as O
a O
tourist O
. O

As O
an O
opponent O
of O
fundamentalism O
( O
the O
term O
existed O
when O
the O
Shah O
was O
still O
ruling O
, O
but O
not O
yet O
at O
all O
) O
, O
an O
atheist O
and O
defender O
of O
the O
Enlightenment O
( O
which O
was O
originally O
anti O
- O
religious O
) O
, O
I O
considered O
the O
Afghan B-MISC
world O
of O
life O
and O
variant O
of O
Islam B-MISC
to O
be O
at O
least O
inhuman O
and O
oppressive O
. O

You O
were O
also O
tolerated O
as O
a O
Western B-MISC
hippie O
to O
be O
welcomed O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
Iran B-LOC
( O
despite O
the O

, O

Pakistan B-LOC
- O
quite O
apart O
of O
the O
Hindu B-MISC

Buddhist B-MISC
countries O
of O

. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
Afghanistan B-LOC
seemed O
to O
be O
an O
Islamic B-MISC
country O
in O
which O
one O
could O
well O
imagine O
, O
e.g. O
to O
work O
and O
live O
as O
a O
doctor O
once O
for O
a O
while O
. O

While O
in O
1978 O
I O
still O
reluctantly O
welcomed O
the O
installation O
of O
Taraki B-LOC
by O
Soviet B-MISC
support O
- O
I O
must O
confess O
- O
as O
an O
opportunity O
for O
a O
secularizing O
and O
" O
enlightening O
" O
policy O
and O
social O
change O
, O
I O
was O
angry O
about O
the O
Soviet B-MISC
invasion O
of O
Christmas O
1978 O
. O

I O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
Afghanistan B-LOC
would O
never O
be O
like O
this O
again O
, O
as O
I O
had O
experienced O
it O
shortly O
before O
, O
even O
if O
the O
attacker O
should O
be O
defeated O
. O

If O
a O
country O
is O
occupied O
and O
brutally O
fought O
for O
so O
long O
by O
a O
power O
that O
is O
totally O
alien O
to O
it O
, O
with O
which O
there O
is O
no O
identification O
, O
a O
culture O
and O
a O
world O
of O
life O
must O
be O
damaged O
. O

The O
centuries O
- O
old O
delicate O
flow O
balance O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
would O
then O
be O
destroyed O
, O
also O
by O
the O
inevitable O
influence O
of O
" O
Western O
interventionists O
" O
, O
as O
you O
write O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
after O
the O
initially O
welcomed O
fall O
of O
the O
Shah O
, O
it O
became O
clear O
what O
one O
had O
to O
think O
of O
an O
" O
Islamic B-MISC
state O
" O
was O
to O
fear O
that O
this O
might O
threaten O
after O
a O
victory O
of O
the O
Mujahideen B-ORG
also O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O

That O
is O
, O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
the O
few O
secular O
sides O
of O
Afghan B-MISC
society O
would O
be O
expected O
to O
be O
taken O
back O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
was O
a O
quiet O
( O
? O

) O
internal O
Afghan O
decision O
on O
further O
social O
development O
has O
become O
impossible O
. O

Although O
this O
decision O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
made O
, O
it O
must O
now O
emerge O
from O
a O
catastrophic O
civil O
war O
of O
divided O
, O
rather O
than O
triumphant O
, O
peoples O
over O
the O
defeat O

. O

You O
have O
now O
described O
this O
terrible O
situation O
very O
well O
for O
me O
in O
your O
editorial O

It O
is O
unfortunately O
true O

" O
that O
military O
intervention O
creates O
infinitely O
more O
problems O
than O
their O
authors O
hope O

solve O
... O

and O
ultimately O
destroys O
those O

whom O
the O

I O
find O
the O

" O

them O

goes O
under O

contradictions O

such O
proposals O
appear O
short O

sighted O
, O
yet O
they O
simply O
exaggerate O
the O
consequences O

Can O
one O
expect O
from O
a O
worker O
who O
is O
supposed O
to O
work O

, O
but O
receives O
less O

a O
serious O
increase O
in O
motivation O
to O
pull O
the O
career O
out O

the O

This O
contradicts O
all O
the O
principles O
of O
modern O
corporate O
psychology O
. O

There O
may O
be O
top O
earners O
at O
Lufthansa B-ORG
, O
resulting O
from O
better O
times O
. O

Here O
you O
can O
imagine O
restrictions O
, O
but O
the O
bulk O
of O
employees O
must O
also O
count O
on O
the O
market O
in O
the O
face O
of O
rising O
living O
costs O
. O

When O
there O
is O
even O
less O
money O
, O
there O
are O
existential O
concerns O
and O
needs O
that O
are O
anything O
but O
performance O
- O
enhancing O
. O

This O
is O
appalling O
for O
a O
service O
company O
that O
lives O
from O
the O
commitment O
of O
employees O
to O
the O
customer O
. O

It O
is O
, O
however O
, O
to O
ask O
whether O
the O
all O
- O
embracing O
noise O
of O
the O
Totenglocken O
for O
Lufthansa B-ORG
is O
not O
already O
demotivating O
. O

As O
a O
passenger O
, O
however O
, O
I O
am O
interested O
in O
being O
optimally O
advised O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
by O
the O
ground O
crew O
and O
to O
be O
able O
to O
enjoy O
a O
good O
service O
during O
the O
flight O
. O

This O
is O
only O
guaranteed O
by O
motivated O
, O
competent O
and O
open O
employees O
. O

Labour O
cuts O
and O
poorer O
working O
conditions O
have O
never O
contributed O
to O
this O
. O

If O
the O
offer O
is O
no O
longer O
attractive O
, O
the O
customer O
goes O
to O
the O
competition O
that O
offers O
these O
conditions O
. O

The O
resulting O
economic O
damage O
would O
probably O
be O
greater O
than O
the O
expected O
500 O
million O
mark O

. O

It O
remains O
to O

hoped O
that O
the O

better O
the O

the O

" O
said O
the O
HSV B-MISC

Until O
the O

, O
he O

it O

thought O

by O
Dirk B-PER
Zander I-PER
, O
who O
smashed O
against O
the O

in O
the O
56th O
minute O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
dynamo O
, O
however O
, O
was O
not O
necessarily O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
opportunity O

rather O
to O
the O

" O

Waigel B-PER
called O

Waigel B-PER
recommended O
that O

to O
the O

which O
had O
agreed O

an O

Otherwise O
the O

Waigel B-PER
pleaded O

use O

Also O
the O

pleaded O

, O
also O
raised O
the O
allegation O
and O
was O
subsequently O
visited O
by O
Rauls B-PER

All O
this O
had O
preceded O
when O
Schaper B-PER
wrote O
down O
his O
notes O
late O
autumn O
last O
year O
. O

Schaper B-PER
reported O
to O
the O
Lower O
Saxony B-LOC
- O
born O
Mr. O
President O
Münch B-PER
and O
the O
Interior B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
in O
Magdeburg O
in O
the O
first O
of O
the O
two O
papers O
that O
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
" O

in O

This O
person O
, O
who O
has O
been O
in O
contact O
with O
Matschke B-PER
for O
some O
time O
, O
knew O
from O
two O
ministers O
still O
in O
office O
of O
the O
state B-LOC
of I-LOC
Saxony I-LOC
- O
Anhalt O
that O
they O
had O
worked O
for O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
State I-ORG

" O

I O
encouraged O

to O
preach O
his O
knowledge O
, O
" O
Schaper B-PER
wrote O
further O
. O
" O

My O
question O
, O
if O
possible O

Minister O
Rauls B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
affected O
, O
was O
confirmed O
by O
source O
. O
" O

In O
the O
second O
remark O
Schaper B-PER
shared O
that O
he O
had O
once O
again O
visited O
" O
Source O
" O
in O
Hanover B-LOC
and O
learned O
that O
the O
other O
government O
member O
might O
not O
be O
a O
minister O
, O
but O
a O
secretary O
of O
state O
. O

Matschke B-PER
has O
informed O
" O
Source O
" O
that O
other O
charged O
persons O
are O
working O
in O
leading O
positions O
of O
the O
police O
and O
district O
governments O
. O

The O
main O
theme O
of O
both O
notes O
, O
however O
, O
were O
Matschke B-PER
's O
compensation O
claims O
to O
the O
state B-LOC
of I-LOC
Saxony I-LOC
- O
Anhalt O
, O
which O
had O
employed O
him O
only O
briefly O
as O
a O
" O
security O
officer O
" O
. O

Schaper B-PER
wrote O
: O

" O
Source O
estimates O
Mr O
Matschke B-PER
to O
be O
such O
that O
he O
would O
not O
disclose O
information O
burdening O
the O
country O
- O
provided O
that O
his O
financial O
claims O
against O
the O
country O
were O
adequately O
met O
" O
. O

Matschke B-PER
is O
not O
interested O
in O
burdening O
this O
government O
with O
negative O
information O
. O

This O
does O
not O
allow O
his O
political O
stand O
, O
" O
Schaper B-PER
quoted O
the O
interlocutor O
. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
dispute O
in O
the O
proceedings O
, O
information O
about O
high O
- O
ranking O
persons O
would O
certainly O
come O
to O
the O
fore O
. O

If O
a O
reasonable O
compromise O
were O
reached O
, O
Matschke B-PER
would O
be O
prepared O
" O
not O
to O
let O
these O
things O
go O
to O
court O
" O
. O

But O
to O
restore O
his O
" O
honor O
" O
and O
his O
" O
business O
reputation O
" O
the O
Frankfurter B-MISC
will O
, O
according O
to O
the O
impression O
of O
the O
Hanoverian B-MISC
, O
make O
every O
effort O
to O
prove O
his O
professional O
activity O
for O
the O
country B-LOC
of I-LOC
Saxony I-LOC
- O
Anhalt O
through O
testimony O
. O

It O
could O
be O
assumed O
that O
Prime O
Minister O
Münch B-PER
and O
the O
Magdeburg B-MISC
Ministry B-ORG
of O
the O
Interior O
had O
immediately O
turned O
to O
the O
Prosecutor B-ORG

Office O
for O
attempted O
extortion O
. O

But O
the O
interior O

Hans O

Peter B-PER
Mahn I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
, O
who O
comes O
from O
Lower O
Saxony O
and O
is O
in O
charge O
of O
intelligence O
, O
spoke O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
last O
week O
of O
a O
" O
normal O

process O
" O
. O

Mahn B-PER
, O
who O
had O
previously O
headed O
the O
constitutional B-ORG
defence I-ORG
office I-ORG
in O
Hanover B-LOC
for O
some O
time O
, O
apparently O
saw O
no O
need O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxon I-MISC
Interior B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
to O
the O
peculiar O
agent O
activity O
of O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxon I-MISC
official O
Boinowitz B-PER
, O
of O
whom O
he O
had O
learned O
through O
Schaper B-PER
's O
notes O
. O

In O
the O
fierce O
debates O
of O
the O
past O
few O
days O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxony I-MISC
side O
also O
had O
to O
accept O
some O
questions O
: O

Why O
did O
the O
Hague B-MISC
Constitutional O
Office O
, O
when O
it O
believed O
that O
it O
had O
received O
burdensome O
information O
about O
a O
former O
minister O
, O
not O
address O
that O
minister O
himself O
? O

Or O
the O
head O
of O
government O
there O
? O

Or O
the O
special O
commission O
appointed O
by O
the O
Landtag O
of B-MISC
Magdeburg I-MISC
to O
examine O
Members O
? O

Or O
the O
Gauck B-MISC
Authority I-MISC
? O

Would O
n't O
it O
have O
been O
even O
better O
to O
turn O
the O
information O
due O
to O
low O
quality O
right O
through O
the O
wool O
? O

These O
questions O
became O
all O
the O
more O
pressing O
, O
as O
Interior O
Minister O
Glogowski B-PER
had O
meanwhile O
informed O
in O
his O
reply O
to O
a O
question O
from O
the O
FDP B-ORG
that O
during O
the O
interrogation O
of O
the O
former O
Stasi B-MISC
officer I-MISC
there O
were O
also O
indications O
of O
other O
East B-MISC
German I-MISC
politicians O
as O
well O
as O
of O
a O
West B-MISC
German I-MISC
who O
had O
been O
a O
member O
of O
a O
state O
government O
and O
no O
longer O
lived O
. O

Glogowski B-PER
attributed O
particular O
weight O
to O
the O
last O
information O
, O
because O
the O
informant O
in O
this O
case O
not O
only O
reported O
from O
the O
hearing O
, O
but O
from O
his O
own O
knowledge O
and O
burdened O
himself O
with O
it O
. O

topic O

It O

BfV B-MISC
President I-MISC
Werthebach B-PER
, O
had O
always O
been O
led O
and O
paid O
by O
Lower O

For O
the O
Lower B-MISC
Saxon I-MISC
constitutionalists O
it O
was O
convenient O
to O
declare O
some O
of O
their O
activities O
as O
auxiliary O
work O
for O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Office I-ORG
. O

This O
included O
all O
kinds O

for O
which O
the O

Only O
just O

Schaper B-PER

he O
says O

The O

for O
a O

in O
the O

nothing O

At O

be O

This O
could O
