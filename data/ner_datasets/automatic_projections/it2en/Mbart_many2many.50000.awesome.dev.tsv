we O

Cipolletta B-PER

" O

there O

In O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
with O
autonomy O
, O
things O
are O
going O
so O

" O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
we O
need O
to O
focus O
more O
and O
more O
on O
scientific O
research O
. O

" O
The O
university B-ORG
has O
its O
expertise O
. O

Often O
the O
research O
does O
n't O
bring O
immediate O
results O
. O

It O
's O
long O
- O
term O
investment O
, O
and O
sometimes O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
unthinkable O
. O
" O

Trentino B-LOC
is O
talking O
about O
building O
a O
hydrogen O
and O
renewable O
energy O
district O
. O

Is O
this O
the O
kind O
of O
sector O
you O
want O
to O
invest O
in O
? O

" O
The O
question O
is O
complex O
. O

Surely O
Thirty B-LOC
ca O
n't O
miss O
an O
opportunity O
to O
invest O
in O
clean O
energy O
like O
hydrogen O
. O

It O
's O
true O
for O
the O
academic O
world O
as O
well O
as O
for O
the O
business O
world O
. O

The O
university B-ORG
will O
have O
a O
new O
president O
and O
the O
opportunity O
to O
program O
investments O
. O

Renewable O
energy O
is O
a O
fundamental O
way O
forward O
, O
but O
there O
's O
room O
for O
other O
sectors O
as O
well O
. O

Then O
you O
should O
n't O
underestimate O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
cognitive B-ORG
sciences I-ORG
faculty I-ORG
, O
which O
has O
great O
potential O
. O
" O

When O
you O
talk O
about O
the O
Trenton O
Atene O
, O
you O
talk O
about O
the O
pivotal O
role O
that O
the O
province B-LOC
's O
funding O
played O
. O

And O
then O
there O
's O
the O
national O
research O
projects O
. O

But O
will O
economic O
support O
come O
from O
the O
private O
sector O
in O
the O
future O
? O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
private O
sector O
is O
going O
to O
do O
too O
much O
research O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
can O
come O
in O
and O
they O
have O
to O
come O
in O
with O
contributions O
from O
companies O
, O
but O
their O
role O
is O
another O
. O

can O
identify O
the O
most O

ARCO B-LOC
-- O
In O
Sunday O
's O
seasonal O
outing O
against O
the O
ferocious O
matriarch O
, O
in O
which O
the O
Arco B-ORG
failed O
to O
go O
beyond O
a O
couple O
- O
linked O

, O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
captain O
and O
charismatic O
leader O
of O
the O
group O
Julius B-PER
Andreoli I-PER
made O
itself O
felt O
, O
and O
not O
least O
. O

The O
cardin O
element O
of O
the O
arcade O
game O
-- O
a O
tremendous O
D B-ORG
experience O
playing O
in O
Benacense B-ORG
, O
Rovereto B-ORG
, O
Arzignano B-ORG
, O
Bassano B-ORG
and O
Santa B-ORG
-- O
had O
to O
sit O
on O
a O
bench O
for O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
mathematician O
the O
week O
before O
and O
not O
be O
able O
to O
be O
100 O
percent O
. O

And O
yet O
the O
captain O
in O
yellow O
and O
blue O
says O
he O
's O
confident O
. O

" O
As O
far O
as O
my O
physical O
condition O
is O
concerned O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
weak O
. O

We O
hope O
that O
the O
problem O
does O
n't O
develop O
into O
a O
tendinitis O
, O
otherwise O
the O
recovery O
time O
will O
be O
longer O
. O

For O
now O
, O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
do O
my O
best O
to O
be O
on O
the O
field O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
maybe O
as O
early O
as O
next O
Sunday O
, O
when O
we O
're O
on O
scene O
in O
Salò B-LOC
, O
a O
move O
that O
deserves O
all O
our O
attention O
. O

Looking O
at O
yesterday O
's O
match O
, O
I O
think O
we O
paid O
a O
price O
for O
the O
excitement O
of O
being O
in O
front O
of O
our O
crowd O
. O

We O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
patience O
to O
get O
it O
right O
and O
to O
start O
with O
the O
right O
foot O
, O
but O
we O
should O
n't O
forget O
that O
for O
many O
of O
my O
colleagues O
, O
it O
was O
the O
very O
first O
time O
in O
this O
series O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
think O
we O
've O
fought O
a O
very O
hard O
race O
, O
putting O
all O
the O
intensity O
we O
can O
into O
the O
field O
. O

We O
were O
n't O
brilliant O
at O
the O
very O
first O
stages O
of O
the O
encounter O
, O
I O
admit O
, O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
first O
time O
, O
we O
tried O
to O
play O
the O
game O
and O
impose O
our O
own O
game O
, O
and O
I O
also O
think O
, O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
we O
did O
quite O
well O
. O

Let O
's O
not O
forget O
the O
goal O
on O
Toccoli B-PER
's O
feet O
-- O
in O
this O
picture O
, O
the O
burnt O
- O
out O
churchyard O
on O
Sunday O
to O
score O
a O
surprise O
by O
finding O
the O
footsteps O
of O
Atti B-PER
, O
ndr O
-- O
where O
their O
forward O
was O
very O
good O
at O
opposing O
the O
footsteps O
, O
and O
also O
the O
goal O
that O
was O
knocked O
out O
at O
Dal B-PER
Ferro I-PER
for O
a O
millimeter O
kick O
. O

The O
second O
time O
, O
heat O
became O
the O
absolute O
dominant O
. O

We O
certainly O
suffered O
more O
than O
they O
did O
, O
but O
probably O
it O
's O
also O
because O
of O
the O
physics O
. O

they O
're O
minutes O
and O
seconds O
faster O
than O
we O
are O
. O

Now O
we O
have O
a O
whole O
week O
ahead O
of O
us O
to O
work O
and O
to O
get O
ourselves O
ready O
for O
the O
next O
game O
, O
correcting O
the O
mistakes O
that O
we O
've O
made O
, O
but O
starting O
from O
how O
good O
it O
has O
been O
. O

I O
hope O
to O
return O
to O
the O
mystery O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
confident O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
next O
week O
, O
we O
may O
have O
a O
better O
basic O
physical O
condition O
than O
that O

After O

up I-ORG

the O

The O

thirty O

old O
trade O

organizations O
over O
the O

, O
" O
says O
Roberto B-PER
Vivian I-PER
, O
secretary O
of O
Fps B-ORG
Cisl I-ORG
. O

The O
escalation O
of O
conflict O
at O
every O
level O
distorts O
negotiations O
and O
disorientates O
workers O
. O

We O
are O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
election O
campaign O
for O
the O
re O
- O
establishment O
of O
the O
U.S.R. B-ORG
, O
and O
the O
denigrating O
action O
of O
so O
many O
trade O
union O
signs O
is O
almost O
a O
strategy O
, O
given O
the O
mid O

November O
meeting O
, O
which O
is O
the O
date O
of O
the O

We O
need O
to O
find O
common O
ground O
. O

Contracts O
of O
employment O
ca O
n't O
be O
legitimate O
only O
by O
those O
who O
think O
they O
have O
a O
majority O
, O
especially O
when O
that O
majority O
does O
n't O
represent O
all O
the O
professions O
to O
which O
the O
contract O
is O
intended O
. O
" O

The O
contradiction O
that O
exists O
is O
evidenced O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
five O
trade O
union O
organizations O
involved O
in O
the O
negotiation O
presented O
five O
different O
platforms O
. O

" O
This O
is O
a O
dangerous O
anomaly O
, O
" O
says O
Vivian B-PER
. O

The O
contract O
must O
provide O
for O
inflation O
- O
related O
wage O
increases O
, O
as O
happened O
at O
the O
national O
level O
. O

At O
this O
stage O
, O
in O
defense O
of O
wages O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
ask O
Apran B-ORG
for O
the O
2002 O
- O
2003 O
pay O
balance O
to O
be O
equally O
matched O
by O
the O
national O
health O

, O
even O
with O
a O
partial O
agreement O
to O
be O
signed O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
to O
continue O
the O
negotiations O
on O
all O
the O
other O
issues O
. O
" O

To O
make O
matters O
even O
more O
complicated O
is O
the O
question O
of O
the O
funds O
that O
have O
been O
set O
aside O
, O
deemed O
insufficient O
. O

" O
Cisl B-ORG
won O
the O
appeal O

that O
, O
in O
the O

the O

" O

" O

for O

" O
says O

Only O
then O
will O
we O
be O
able O
to O
assess O
the O
need O
for O

we O

long O
time O
and O
that O
could O
now O
become O
a O
reality O
. O

Massimo B-PER
Egidi I-PER
, O
in O
fact O
, O
could O
take O
the O
lead O
in O
what O
until O
a O
while O
ago O
was O
called O
the O
Commission B-ORG
of I-ORG
May I-ORG
, O
after O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Luiss B-ORG
. O

It O
's O
a O
working O
group O
studying O
and O
designing O
the O
governance O
guidelines O
for O
the O
Italian O
University O
of O
the O
Future O
. O

Adriano B-PER
De I-PER
Maio I-PER
left O
office O
, O
and O
his O
ideal O
successor O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
inquiry O
of O
the O
Senate O
of O
Trento B-LOC
. O

The O
possibility O
of O
a O
pole O
vault O
is O
most O
likely O
given O
by O
The B-ORG
World I-ORG
, O
the O
economic O
magazine O
that O
pays O
special O
attention O
to O
the O
universe O
of O
the O
Italian B-LOC
academic O
community O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
July O
, O
Adriano B-PER
De I-PER
Maio I-PER
left O
the O
ministry O
committee O
that O
was O
tasked O
with O
redesigning O
the O
teacher O

legal O
system O

redesigning O

" O
On O
this O
very O
topic O

it O

under O

In O
the O

-- O
the O
proposals O
that O
De B-PER
Mai I-PER
made O
, O
like O
cutting O
graduate O

, O
they O
ended O
up O
in O
the O

they O
did O
n't O
like O
professional O
orders O
and O
the O
undersecretary O
Maria B-PER
Grazia I-PER
Siliquini I-PER
. O
" O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
the O
reason O
it O
's O
broken O
is O
because O
De B-PER
Maio I-PER
has O
n't O
been O
named O
president O
of O
the O
NRC B-ORG
. O

So O
this O
is O
where O
Massimo B-PER
Egidi I-PER
comes O
in O

Letizia B-PER
Moratti I-PER
might O
point O
to O
the O

going O

operate O
with O
Francesco B-PER

A O
few O

after O
the O

Signifredi B-PER

The O
buyer O
of O
the O
company O
did O

even O
pay O
the O
1,000 O
euros O
in O
rent O
. O

The O
company O
was O
declared O
bankrupt O
after O
the O
merchant O
was O
arrested O
. O

People B-PER
feel O
cheated O
by O
Paolo B-PER
Signifredi I-PER
. O

That O
's O
why O
the O
developer O
filed O
a O
lawsuit O
against O
the O
Parma B-LOC
merchant O
who O
bought O
Chini B-ORG
construction I-ORG
for O
a O
thousand O
euros O
-- O
money O
that O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
Mr.fredi B-PER
never O
paid O
. O

Mr. O
Chini B-ORG
was O
arrested O
by O
the O
Financial O
Services O
Department O
a O
few O
days O
after O
he O
bought O
the O
car O
because O
he O
had O
to O
pay O
a O
three O
- O
year O
fine O
for O
the O
prescription O
and O
the O
recycling O
of O
a O
used O
car O
tire O
. O

The O
arrest O
of O
Signifredi B-PER
precipitated O
things O
, O
and O
within O
days O
the O
court B-ORG
of I-ORG
Trento I-ORG
declared O
the O
Chinese B-ORG
a O
failure O
. O

A O
month O
later O
, O
the O
Prosecutor B-ORG
's I-ORG
Office I-ORG
called O
for O
the O
arrests O
of O
Chini B-PER
and O
his O
son O
Gianluca B-PER
, O
charged O
with O
fraudulent O
bankruptcy O
. O

Next O
, O
Chini B-PER
decided O
to O
sue O
Signifredi B-PER
. O

The O
merchant O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
the O
white O
horseman O
called O
to O
save O
the O
Chinese B-ORG
, O
and O
instead O
, O
he O
was O
the O
one O
who O
buried O
it O
. O

But O
the O
allegation O
of O
cheating O
is O
probably O
related O
to O
a O
series O
of O
deals O
that O
the O
two O
entrepreneurs O
made O
. O

Chini B-PER
accuses O
Signifredi B-PER
of O
not O
believing O
in O
his O
commitments O
, O
of O
deceiving O
him O
about O
the O
seriousness O
of O
his O
intentions O
. O

China B-PER
, O
in O
fact O
, O
has O
always O
argued O
that O
the O
company O
could O
safely O
avoid O
failure O
, O
since O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
the O
licenses O
would O
come O
for O
the O
five O
shopping O
malls O
that O
China B-ORG
was O
planning O
to O
build O
in O
the O
Northeast O
. O

It O
was O
about O
business O
that O
would O
definitely O
make O
the O
Chinese B-ORG
happy O
. O

Things O
that O
could O
n't O
be O
done O
because O
of O
failure O
. O

Now O
it O
's O
the O
curator O
who O
's O
trying O
to O
pull O
the O
plug O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
revenues O
could O
be O
much O
lower O
than O
they O
would O
be O
under O
normal O
management O
. O

Chini B-PER
had O
left O
the O
task O
of O
managing O
these O
businesses O
to O
Signifredi B-PER
, O
who O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
creditors O
and O
then O
hand O
over O
the O
company O
to O
a O
real O
estate O
entrepreneur O
in O
Grosseto B-LOC
, O
Galeardi B-PER
. O

The O
merchant O
's O
arrest O
, O
though O
, O
blew O
everything O
up O
. O

That O
's O
why O
China B-PER
got O
sued O
, O
and O
they O
decided O
to O
file O
a O
lawsuit O
. O

The O
entrepreneur O
feels O
victimized O
because O
in O
his O
optics O
, O
he O
had O
every O
means O
at O
his O
disposal O
to O
save O
the O
company O
. O

This O
would O
, O
of O
course O
, O
also O
have O
saved O
the O
position O
of O
the O
same O
Chinese B-PER
who O
later O
ended O
up O
in O
house O
arrests O
and O
are O
now O
still O
being O
tried O
along O
with O

son O
on O
charges O
of O

People B-PER
are O
even O
at O

of O

because O
it O

for O

According O
to O
the O
prosecutor B-ORG

office O
, O
the O
two O
men O
were O
only O
planning O
the O
attack O

which O
was O
then O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
two O
accomplices O
, O
who O
were O
identified O
by O
two O
people O
. O

The O
organizational O
work O
would O
have O
been O
done O
based O
on O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
places O
by O
the O
' O
30s B-PER
who O
had O
done O
retrofits O
. O

The O
witnesses O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
maintained O
that O
the O
two O
kidnappers O
were O
moving O
around O
their O
home O
with O
perfect O
knowledge O
of O
the O
location O
, O
as O
long O
as O
they O
knew O
where O
the O
gate O
was O
. O

According O
to O
the O
investigators O
, O
Trentini B-PER
would O
have O
provided O
Spain B-PER
with O
the O
information O
it O
needed O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
attack O
, O
but O
according O
to O
the O
judges O
at O
the O
district O
court B-ORG
, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
this O
. O

And O
the O
judges O
also O
noted O
that O
Trentini B-PER
was O
incarcerated O
from O
1999 O
to O
2003 O

So O
he O
ca O

He O
himself O
told O
the O
gip O
that O
he O
had O
done O
those O
jobs O
in O
1992 O

Over O
time O
, O
the O
judges O
doubted O
that O
Thirty B-PER
could O
be O
the O
source O
of O
such O
detailed O
information O

to O
allow O

for O

Paolo B-PER

to O
start O
working O
on O
the O
area O
north O

that O
the O

identified O

which O
will O
only O
be O
integrated O

What O
emerges O

the O
fundamental O
feasibility O
of O
the O
project O
, O
with O
a O
set O
of O
technical O
prescriptions O

specifications O

" O
It O

clear O
that O
from O
a O
geological O
point O
of O
view O
-- O
Passardi B-PER
says O
-- O
the O
whole O
issue O
is O
always O
about O
economic O
possibilities O
, O
and O
it O
's O
true O
that O
almost O
anything O
can O
be O
done O
if O
you O
have O
the O
resources O
. O

I O
would O
argue O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
problems O
in O
that O
area O
, O
which O
are O
there O
and O
need O
to O
be O
addressed O
, O
are O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
what O
we O
can O
do O
. O

It O
's O
not O
up O
to O
me O
, O
of O
course O
, O
to O
say O
whether O
it O
's O
the O
best O
possible O
choice O
, O
but O
technically O
speaking O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
not O
the O
most O
ideal O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
's O
not O
the O
least O
desirable O
, O
and O
the O
predictable O
interventions O
are O
possible O
. O
" O

Passardi B-PER
tries O
to O
root O
out O
the O
main O
problem O
, O
which O
is O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
Laghman B-LOC
biotope O
in O
the O
nearest O
part O
of O
the O
rock O
wall O
. O

In O
order O
not O
to O
damage O
such O
a O
delicate O
environment O
, O
he O
launched O
the O
idea O
of O
moving O
the O
road O
, O
which O
now O
passes O
next O
to O
it O
, O
to O
a O
new O
site O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
plain O
, O
along O
the O
Arctic B-LOC
river O
bank O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
all O
the O
traffic O
, O
which O
consists O
of O
trucks O
loaded O
with O
garbage O
that O
go O
to O
the O
Ischia B-LOC
Podetti I-LOC
garbage O
dump O
, O
but O
in O
the O
future O
also O
the O
means O
directed O
to O
the O
rotting O
pole O
companies O
, O
would O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
biotope O
, O
and O
the O
system O
of O
access O
to O
the O
various O
companies O
could O
be O
rationally O
organized O
along O
the O
river O
. O

It O
would O
also O
allow O
us O
to O
turn O
the O
existing O
road O
into O
a O
bike O
lane O
, O
which O
would O
make O
the O
area O
of O
the O
biotope O
and O
the O
rock O
gym O
even O
more O
walkable O
. O

But O
the O
delicate O
environmental O
balance O
of O
the O
glaciers B-LOC
will O
still O
be O
in O
jeopardy O
if O
no O
other O
precautions O
are O
taken O
. O

Because O
beyond O
the O
wetlands O
, O
the O
biotope O
is O
a O
delicate O
habitat O
, O
populated O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
by O
a O
few O
species O
of O
migratory O
birds O
. O

So O
you O
also O
have O
to O
be O
very O
careful O
about O
the O
acoustic O
impact O
of O
your O
work O
and O
the O
light O
pollution O
at O
night O
. O

That O
's O
why O
the O
work O
has O
to O
be O
done O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
it O
's O
not O
disturbing O
, O
so O
it O
's O
essentially O
inside O
the O
canopy O
, O
and O
the O
outside O
lighting O
has O
to O
be O
subject O
to O
restrictions O
and O
controls O
. O

One O
of O
the O
problems O
that O
has O
been O
reported O
over O
and O
over O
again O
that O
concerns O
the O
people O
of O
Vela B-LOC
is O
the O
altitude O
of O
the O
ground O
, O
which O
is O
practically O
the O
level O
of O

But O
this O
is O
technically O
considered O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
easiest O
and O
most O
cost O
- O
effective O
problems O
to O
solve O
, O
especially O
at O
a O
time O
like O
this O
, O
when O
the O
material O
is O
big O
enough O
, O
for O
example O
, O
to O
dig O
the O
tunnel O
underneath O
Martinique B-LOC
. O

There O
would O
be O
no O
big O
problem O
finding O
water O
solutions O
to O
prevent O
the O
intervention O
from O
happening O
again O
, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
full O
- O
scale O
, O
on O
the O
inhabited O
area O
of O
the O
suburb O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
havoc O
could O
be O
caused O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
an O
electrical O
duct O
running O
through O
the O
area O
, O
and O
that O
, O
given O
the O
current O
regulations O
and O
the O
relative O
compliance O
phases O
, O
things O
will O
have O
to O
be O
moved O
, O
with O
all O
the O
associated O
costs O
, O
but O
most O
of O
all O
, O
the O
associated O
time O
. O

So O
the O
problems O
are O
there O
, O
but O
they O
seem O
to O
be O
solvable O
. O

Now O
it O
's O
up O
to O
the O
political O
side O
to O
decide O
whether O
the O
game O
is O
worth O

The O
bonus O
does O
not O
apply O

because O

on O
Monday O
by O
Grisenti B-PER

who O
talked O
about O

that O

" O
In O
our O
opinion O
, O
" O
said O
President O
Armando B-PER

, O
" O
the O
most O
appropriate O
solution O
would O
be O
to O

" O

The O

called O
in O
to O

has O
turned O
out O

be O
very O
rigid O

To O
put O
it O
all O
together O
, O
the O
scenario O
of O

pushing O
up O

60 O

possible O
, O
according O
to O

After O

International B-ORG

's O
recent O
assessment O
that O
the O
high O

will O
reflect O
a O
weaker O

of O
the O

by O
half O
a O
percentage O
point O
, O
yesterday O
the O
BCE B-ORG
came O
out O
on O
the O
scene O

suggesting O
that O
there O
is O
, O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time O
, O
uncertainty O
about O
the O
recovery O
, O
largely O
due O
to O
high O

And O
the O
same O
Minister O

Domenico B-PER

has O
pointed O
out O
that O

are O
also O
a O
concern O
for O
Italy B-LOC

especially O
in O
terms O

So O
the O
unremitting O
race O

now O
at O
the O
center O
of O
the O
debate O
about O
the O
outlook O
for O

Yesterday O

the O

, O
Jean O

Claude B-PER
Trichet I-PER
, O
summed O
up O
the O
concerns O
of O
European O
central O
bankers O
by O
pointing O
out O
that O
" O
high O
oil O
prices O
have O
had O
a O
direct O
visible O
impact O
" O
on O
inflation O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
according O
to O
Trichet B-PER
, O
we O
've O
already O
seen O
the O
effects O
on O
consumer O
price O
dynamics O
, O
which O
are O
unlikely O
to O
go O
below O
two O
percent O
in O
the O
eurozone O
by O
the O
end O
of O
this O
year O
. O

But O
what O
's O
more O
worrying O
is O
the O
likelihood O
that O
there O
will O
be O
side O
effects O
, O
which O
until O
now O
have O
either O
not O
been O
present O
or O
have O

This O

it O
would O

the O
" O

of O

that O

for O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Stradale B-ORG

That O
's O
why O
, O
starting O
last O

, O
the O
police B-ORG

met O
with O
President O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER

explaining O
the O

the O
need O

only O
when O
it O

On O

the O

maximum O

with O

a O
meeting O
between O
President O
Dellai B-PER

His O
Holiness O
the O

over O
the O

So O
the O
province B-LOC
would O
be O
involved O
in O
completing O
the O
structure O
. O

All O
right O
? O

No O
, O
because O
it O
's O
been O
reported O
from O
Rome B-LOC
-- O
informally O
so O
far O
-- O
that O
there O
's O
some O
confusion O
about O
that O
passage O
. O

" O
We O
now O
want O
to O
understand O
how O
the O
Chief O
intends O
to O
behave O
, O
because O
that O
way O
we O
risk O
losing O
the O
province B-LOC

funding O
, O
" O

Gianfranco B-PER
Conte I-PER
del O
Sap B-ORG
del O
Trentino B-LOC

the O
autonomous B-ORG
police I-ORG
union I-ORG

" O
From O
the O
outset O
, O
we O
set O
up O
a O
joint O
table O
of O
the O
Siulp B-ORG
, O
Silp B-ORG
Cgil I-ORG
and O
Sap B-ORG
unions O
to O
solve O
the O
new O

problem O
together O
. O

We O
've O
already O
said O
that O
we O
're O
only O
going O
to O
move O
in O
if O
there O
's O
all O
the O
services O
that O
are O
anticipated O
in O
the O
new O

. O

And O
in O
the O
current O
state O
, O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O

you O
ca O
n't O

you O
ca O
n't O
finish O

you O

So O
we O
asked O
the O
provincial B-LOC

to O
intervene O
, O
maybe O
do O
the O
math O
without O
hesitation O
, O
because O
the O

did O
n't O
like O
that O

" O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
Rome B-LOC
does O
not O
tolerate O
the O
province B-LOC

interference O
in O
similar O
matters O

as O
did O
the O
former O
Chief O

who O

" O
We O

know O

received O
any O
official O

" O
the O
Sap B-ORG

not O
doing O
so O
well O

its O

From O
Mathieu B-PER
Eckley I-PER

According O
to O
the O
new O
State O
of O
the O
Environment O
Report O
, O
the O
quality O
of O
water O
in O
the O
Arctic B-LOC
in O
the O
Triennial O
period O
fluctuates O
between O
" O
not O
polluted O
" O
and O
" O
polluted O
. O
" O

On O
the O
scale O
of O
values O
, O
however O
, O
the O

gained O
a O
rating O
of O
between O
two O
and O
three O
on O
a O
scale O
ranging O
from O
one O
to O
five O
. O

So O
, O
all O
in O
all O
, O
it O
's O
a O
pretty O
good O
judgment O
, O
even O
considering O
the O
latest O
rating O
given O
by O
the O
national O
legislation O
, O
which O
gives O
Adige B-LOC
a O
two O

star O
rating O
. O

And O
the O
folks O
in O
the O

also O
said O
that O
, O
" O
If O
you O

The O

the O

that O

the O

which O
is O
also O
related O

the O

. O

Among O
the O
big O

, O
the O
Adige B-LOC
is O
the O
one O
that O
does O
best O
, O
even O
though O
you O
have O
to O
consider O
that O
, O
often O
, O
the O
level O
of O
pollution O
increases O
progressively O
( O
even O
if O
not O
proportionately O
) O
away O
from O

And O
the O

also O

In O

the O

various O

you O

maybe O
your O

to O

? O

First O
of O
all O
, O
to O
contribute O

It O
should O

up O

It O

in O

because O
it O

expected O

So O
among O
the O

they O
're O
going O
to O
extend O

extend O
retirement O

By O

, O
the O

They O

starting O

in O

they O
're O
going O

followed O
by O
another O

N.D. B-PER
would O
have O
liked O
to O
continue O
the O
teaching O
that O
he O
started O
last O
year O
. O

He O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
that O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
satisfy O
that O
need O
for O

that O
all O

Last O
January O
, O
the O
teacher O
gave O
a O
science O

on O
the O
human O

a O
sex O
education O
lesson O
, O
supported O
by O
a O
children O

book O
. O

This O
was O
all O
due O
to O
a O
request O
from O
some O
schoolchildren O
. O

N.D. B-PER
was O
explaining O
how O
animals O
reproduce O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
kids O
, O
more O
than O
a O
few O
of O
them O
photographed O
, O
asked O
for O
disappointments O
about O
the O
subject O
, O
coming O
up O
with O
a O
question O
that O
many O
parents O
still O
have O
in O
their O
heads O
: O

" O
And O
how O
are O

" O
I O
do O

The O
time O

is O
over O
. O

Eight- O
to O
nine O
- O
year O
- O
olds O
are O
very O
physically O
and O
intellectually O
alive O
, O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
let O
themselves O
be O
fooled O
by O
stories O
. O

N.D. B-PER
's O
approach O
, O
who O
knew O
the O
six O
females O
and O
the O
17 O
males O
in O
that O
class O
well O
, O
was O
pragmatic O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
, O
the O
teacher O
, O
who O
specializes O
in O
teaching O
math O
and O
science O
, O
provided O
the O
materials O
: O

technical O
blueprints O
to O
tell O
us O
, O
with O
their O
names O
, O
how O
human O
sexual O
organs O
are O
made O
and O
how O
they O
're O
born O
. O

But O
five O
- O
year O
- O
old O
parents O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
initiative O
, O
and O
after O
a O
meeting O
, O
they O
asked O
school O
principal O
Maria B-PER
Luisa I-PER
Brioli I-PER
to O
talk O
to O
them O
. O

So O
in O
April O
, O
we O
took O
the O
control O
of O
the O
classroom O
. O

Ivana B-PER
Pulisizzi I-PER
, O
then O
editor O
- O
in O
- O
chief O
of O
Proceedings B-ORG
, O
attended O
one O
of O
N.D. B-PER
's O
lectures O
and O
designed O
a O
relationship O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
a O
family O
decided O
to O
send O
their O
daughter O
away O
from O
school O
to O
attend O
a O
private O
school O
. O

The O
parents O
of O
De B-ORG
Carli I-ORG
-- O
the O
same O
institution O
from O
which O
, O
a O
decade O
ago O
, O
Reverend O
Sartori B-PER
, O
on O
a O
pastoral O
visit O
, O
was O
kindly O
rejected O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
secularism O
of O
the O
school O
-- O
so O
they O
divided O
into O
two O
camps O
: O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
they O
wanted O
to O
distance O
the O
teacher O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
they O
appreciated O
the O
educational O
effort O
that O
was O
being O
made O
. O

After O
the O
inspection O
, O
the O
manager O
was O
sent O
a O
letter O
with O
15 O
signatures O
. O

a O
document O
to O
ask O
for O
, O
basically O
, O
confirmation O
of O
the O
assignment O
of O
the O
cathedral O
. O

" O
We O
'd O
like O
to O
call O
on O
parents O
and O
educators O
to O
be O
more O
tolerant O
of O
individual O
problems O
, O
not O
to O
turn O
them O
into O
processes O
. O
" O

The O
Pulitzer O
Prize O
- O
winning O
investigator O
had O
not O
met O
the O
limits O
for O
disciplinary O
action O
-- O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
teaching O
offered O
by O
N.D. B-PER
was O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
widely O
recognized O
-- O
and O
had O
left O
the O
door O
open O
for O
conciliation O
. O

The O
alternative O
was O
a O
coordinated O
movement O
. O

So O
this O
is O
the O
second O
path O
that O
was O
ultimately O
chosen O
. O

N.D. B-PER
is O
going O
to O
be O
the O
Pigarelli B-ORG
support O
teacher O
. O

But O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
otherwise O
. O

Today O
, O
it O
keeps O
us O
in O
mind O
that O
, O
on O
his O
part O
, O
there O
was O
a O
willingness O
to O
continue O
the O
work O
that O
he O
did O
at O
De B-ORG
Carli I-ORG
school I-ORG
: O

" O
There O
has O
been O
an O
attack O
on O
the O
freedom O
of O
teaching O
. O

On O
August O
30th O
, O
Brioli B-PER
's O
principal O
proposed O
to O
me O
that O
I O
choose O
between O
two O
classes O
at O
Pigarelli B-ORG
and O
two O
classes O
at O
S. B-ORG
Anna I-ORG
. O

At O
that O
point O
I O
also O
accepted O
support O
, O
but O
I O
never O
said O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
back O
to O
De B-ORG
Carli I-ORG
. O
" O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
the O
tensions O
between O
the O
teacher O
and O
some O
of O
the O
families O
have O
deep O
roots O
. O

The O
sexuality O
education O
lesson O
is O
just O
the O
latest O
in O
a O
series O
of O
controversies O
. O

" O
I O
understand O
-- O
N.D. B-PER
says O
-- O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
are O
used O
to O
standard O
methods O
, O
but O
I O
've O
always O
tried O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
could O
, O
to O
make O
the O
lesson O
more O
interesting O
. O

For O
example O
, O
I O
use O
newspaper O
- O
published O
statistics O
to O
teach O
that O
study O
is O
also O
topical O
. O

And O
if O
they O
ask O
me O
how O
the O
babies O
are O
born O
, O
I O
prepare O
a O
lesson O
. O
" O

For O
kids O

the O
new O

Davide B-PER

Benedetto I-PER
( O

met O

Naval O
Forces O
to O
discuss O
the O
investigation O
into O
the O
new O
cases O
of O
Legionella O
at O
Santa O
Chiara O
. O

The O
new O
wave O
is O
very O
recent O
. O

These O
are O
some O
of O
the O
cases O
that O
have O
been O
recorded O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
. O

In O
one O
case O
, O
Legionella O
would O
also O
cause O
the O
death O
of O
a O
cancer O
patient O
. O

The O
top O
prosecutor O
's O
office O
actually O
dealt O
with O
this O
case O
. O

The O
investigators O
decided O
to O
get O
all O
the O
women O
's O
medical O
records O
. O

The O
crime O
hypothesis O
at O
the O
moment O
is O
premeditated O
murder O
. O

The O
fascicle O
has O
been O
opened O
up O
with O
" O
identifiable O
" O
stuff O
, O
basically O
they O
have O
n't O
looked O
at O
it O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

But O
this O
time O
, O
the O
situation O
is O
radically O
different O
than O
in O
the O
past O
. O

The O
first O
inquiry O
started O
with O
nine O
deaths O
, O
even O
though O
only O
five O
cases O
had O
passed O
the O
age O
of O
prosecution O
. O

But O
now O
we O
're O
faced O
with O
a O
single O
death O
, O
and O
this O
raises O
the O
question O
as O
to O
how O
the O
woman O
who O
was O
previously O
referred O
back O
to O
Bologna B-LOC
, O
so O
it O
's O
not O
certain O
that O
she O
's O
contracted O
the O
infection O
at O
Santa O
Clara O
. O

It O
's O
no O
coincidence O
that O
the O
only O
fictitious O
book O
that O
's O
out O
there O
right O
now O
is O
a O
fictitious O
homicide O
. O

It O
would O
n't O
stand O
as O
an O
epidemic O
hypothesis O
right O
now O
, O
not O
even O
a O
common O
epidemic O
. O

The O

we O
've O
come O
up O
with O
a O
number O
of O
measures O
to O
counteract O
that O
. O
" O

In O

to O
measures O
such O
as O
" O
optimizing O
transportation O

, O
reducing O

" O
The O

" O
Tortoli B-PER

" O

be O

said O

chief O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
at O
a O
March O
meeting O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC
with O
her O
colleagues O
Sabina B-PER

After O
pointing O
out O
that O
the O
data O
can O
be O
read O
as O
evidence O
of O
the O
importance O
Trentino B-LOC
places O
on O
culture O
, O
Cogo B-PER
's O
advisor O
conceded O
that O
the O
figure O
could O
also O
be O
indicative O
of O
expensive O
management O
. O

" O
The O
fact O
that O
economies O
of O
scale O
need O
to O
be O
developed O
is O
unquestionable O
, O
" O
he O
then O
politely O
admitted O
, O
addressing O
the O
advisors O
, O
the O
cultural O
directors O
, O
and O
the O
museum O
directors O
who O
had O
gathered O
at O
the O
Library O
of O
the O
Historical O
Archive O
in O
the O
' O
900s O
, O
where O
the O
first O
of O
a O
series O
of O
meetings O
was O
held O
to O
try O
and O
make O
the O
museum O
system O
of O
the O
Euro B-LOC
- I-LOC
region I-LOC
of O
Upper O
Austria O
- O
Tirol O
a O
single O
network O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
many O
European O
countries O
, O
there O
is O
a O
growing O
tendency O
to O
rely O
on O
museums O
for O
tasks O
that O
go O
beyond O
simply O
preserving O
collections O
, O
to O
embrace O
the O
broader O
field O
of O
promoting O
cultural O
events O
. O

And O
this O
requires O
territorial O
coordination O
and O
new O
management O
logics O
, O
system O
logics O
. O

And O
it O
was O
this O
realization O
that O
led O
to O
the O
meeting O
that O
the O
three O
people O
responsible O
for O
culture O
on O
the O
Rovereto B-LOC
- O
Innsbruck B-LOC
axis O
decided O
to O
organize O
to O
study O
forms O
of O
collaboration O
. O

It O
's O
immediately O
said O
that O
both O
the O
Zanon B-PER
and O
the O
Kasslatter B-PER
Mur I-PER
, O
in O
turn O
for O
Tyrol B-LOC
and O
South B-LOC
Tyrol I-LOC
, O
look O
very O
carefully O
at O
the O
perspective O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
Bolzano B-LOC
wants O
, O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
to O
create O
a O
Monaco B-LOC
- O
Verona B-LOC

, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
at O

So O
the O
ideas O
did O

go O
away O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
people O
are O
concerned O
, O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
has O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
problem O
, O
certainly O
not O
the O
secondary O
problem O
, O
is O
in O
some O
ways O
ethical O

" O
We O

Here O
's O
the O
communiqué O
issued O
last O
night O
after O
a O
short O
meeting O
: O

" O
The O
Trentino B-LOC
D.C. O

welcomes O
the O

which O
the O

resumed O

after O
the O

In O
particular O
, O
the O
prosecutor O
for O
the O

welcomes O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
coalition O
is O
meeting O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
to O
discuss O
and O
deepen O
the O
issues O
of O

, O
mobility O
, O
institutional O
reform O
and O
energy O
. O
" O

Anyway O
, O
so O
on O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
this O
news O
release O
followed O
a O
few O
hours O
after O
the O
publication O
of O
an O
interview O
with O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
, O
who O
was O
never O
so O
angry O
. O

Yes O
, O
with O
so O
many O
bellicose O
statements O
about O
respecting O
the O
program O
and O
defending O
the O
" O
idea O
" O
that O
the O
left O
has O
of O
institutional O
reform O
. O

The O
Democrats B-ORG
on I-ORG
the O
left O
of O
the O
Trentino B-LOC
are O
always O
able O
to O
surprise O
. O

as O
soon O
as O
you O
create O
a O
Quercia B-ORG
photograph O
, O
it O
dissolves O
. O

You O
think O
you O
've O
put O
all O
the O
names O
in O
the O
different O
categories O
, O
and O
in O
a O
blink O
, O
the O
castle O
jumps O
into O
the O
air O
. O

It O
's O
really O
an O
endless O
epic O
. O

But O
was O
n't O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
the O
" O
Followers B-PER
of O
the O
Future O
" O
guy O
who O
was O
calling O
for O
respect O
for O
the O
programs O
and O
pushing O
for O
criticism O
of O
the O
institutional O
reform O
and O
the O
research O
agenda O
? O

But O
now O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
. O

And O
was O
n't O
this O
the O
last O
one O
who O
led O
the O
wire O
- O
tapping O
party O
-- O
the O
governing O
party O
, O
the O
president O
's O
most O
loyal O
party O
-- O
willing O
to O
step O
down O
and O
not O
give O
up O
their O
hairy O
pillows O
? O

No O
, O
that O
's O
not O
true O
. O

Now O
you O
're O
waiting O
for O
new O
categories O
, O
new O
positions O
, O
more O
strings O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
Q&amp;A B-ORG
Congress O
has O
a O
lot O
to O
do O
with O
30th O
- O
century O
politics O
, O
even O
though O
the O
Honourable O
Gigi B-PER
Olivieri I-PER
is O
right O
when O
he O
says O
that O
all O
in O
all O
, O
" O
We O
're O
a O
thousand O
- O
member O
constituency O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
we O
have O
to O
look O
beyond O
the O
party O
. O
" O

Yes O
, O
because O
many O
of O
today O
's O
surgeries O
can O
be O
read O
as O
" O
amendments O
" O
to O
the O
redesign O
of O
the O
recorder O
. O

If O
the O
Cogo B-PER
takes O
a O
stand O
against O
Dellai B-PER
, O
it O
's O
clear O
that O
it O
's O
worried O
about O
occupying O
the O
space O
of O
those O
who O
think O
the O
left O
is O
too O
attached O
to O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
the O
space O
now O
occupied O
by O
Andreolli B-PER
and O
Chiodi B-PER
. O

The O
most O
ironic O
one O
these O
days O
seems O
to O
be O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
, O
who O
's O
getting O
some O
credit O
. O

" O
When O
I O
said O
the O
things O
that O
now O
the O
Cogo B-PER
supports O
, O
I O
went O
for O
what O
it O
wants O
to O
tear O
everything O
apart O
. O

Mindfulness O
. O

And O
what O
a O
wretched O
-- O
he O
smiled O
yesterday O
-- O
to O
hear O
Dellai B-PER
wanting O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
centrality O
of O
politics O
and O
parties O
. O

Right O
now O
as O
I O
'm O
leaving O
, O
it O
's O
almost O
like O
I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
another O
assignment O
. O
" O

For O
Congress O
, O
games O
are O
not O
made O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
candidacies O
of O
Andreolli B-PER

Wanda B-PER
Chiodi I-PER

some O
voices O
are O

for O
a O
" O

nomination O
as O

that O

tight O

that O

It O

no O

that O
the O

two O

actually O
the O

That O

why O

he O
's O
going O
to O
see O
him O
with O
his O
friends O
Ricardo B-PER

Dante B-PER
, O
but O
also O
because O
Modena B-LOC

the O

seemed O

a O
few O

But O
it O

say O
: O

I O
agree O

it O

the O

does O

" O

President O
Dellai B-PER
, O
you O
know O
, O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
, O
he O
only O
accepted O
half O
of O
the O
four O
requests O
you O
made O
. O

" O
In O
fact O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
there O
's O
only O
been O
half O
of O
the O
commitment O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
government O
on O
the O
first O
issue O
. O

The O
other O
three O
do O
n't O
. O

The O
minister O
repeatedly O
told O
us O
not O
to O
be O
far O
from O
where O
we O
are O
, O
but O
then O
he O
added O
: O

We O
need O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
political O
spectrum O
. O
" O

Well O
, O
you O
brought O
something O
home O
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
there O
is O
a O
commitment O
by O
the O
government O
that O
the O
institutional O
changes O
only O
come O
into O
effect O
if O
they O
involve O
more O
autonomy O
. O

But O
there O
's O
one O
thing O
. O

It O
's O
all O
a O
matter O
of O
national O
interest O
. O

If O
the O
government O
insists O
that O
a O
provincial O
law O
governs O
this O
interest O
, O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
the O
Court B-ORG
anymore O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
which O
is O
the O
political O
body O
, O
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
can O
delete O
it O
. O

This O
is O
clearly O
unacceptable O
to O
us O
. O
" O

Perhaps O
the O
minister O
means O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
also O
has O
to O
remember O
that O
it O
's O
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O

" O
The O
concept O
of O
national O
interest O
is O
dangerous O
, O
because O
it O
's O
not O
defined O
. O

It O
's O
so O
vague O
that O
, O
of O
course O
, O
being O
at O
the O
discretion O
of O
political O
bodies O
, O
it O
resorts O
to O
possible O
coercion O
. O

Even O
more O
serious O
is O
the O
possibility O
that O
Parliament B-ORG
is O
going O
to O
vote O
to O
amend O
our O
autonomy O
statute O
without O
our O
consent O
. O

The O
minister O
, O
although O
he O
said O
he O
was O
personally O
in O
favour O
, O
said O
the O
majority O
were O
against O
. O

Calderoli B-PER
also O
rejected O
our O
request O
that O
there O
be O
no O
contested O
elections O
. O
" O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
legislative O
term O
in O
Trinidad O
and O
Tobago B-LOC
is O
going O
to O
be O
three O
years O
? O

" O
We O
ca O
n't O
accept O
that O
the O
head O
of O
state O
can O
dissolve O
the O
regional B-ORG
council I-ORG
. O

And O
Calderoli B-PER
did O
n't O
commit O
to O
that O
either O
, O
and O
he O
put O
it O
back O
on O
the O
table O
. O

We O
suggested O
defining O
the O
issue O
through O
statutory O
enforcement O
rules O
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
intent O
, O
it O
might O
be O

prepared O

poised O
to O
sink O

the O

Bertoldi B-PER
, O
when O
did O
you O
hear O
Torretta B-PER
and O
Pari B-PER
? O

Torretta B-PER
and O
I O
saw O
each O
other O
at O
the O
end O
of O
April O
, O
and O
Pari B-PER
and O
I O
heard O
each O
other O
on O
the O
chat O
room O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
. O

Did O
they O
seem O
to O
fear O
for O
their O
innocence O
? O

They O
told O
me O
that O
from O
Italy B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
looked O
worse O
than O
it O
really O
was O
. O

What O
can O
civilian O
volunteers O
do O
to O
work O
with O
minimal O
security O
guarantees O
? O

I O
would O
say O
the O
precautions O
are O
the O
usual O
ones O
. O

to O
keep O
a O
low O
profile O
, O
not O
to O
run O
around O
with O
guns O
or O
stockpiles O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
you O
have O
to O
have O
a O
relationship O
with O
people O
. O

Trust O
is O
transferred O
, O
proximity O
to O
their O
issues O
, O
and O
that O
's O
the O
best O
form O
of O
security O
. O

What O
's O
new O
about O
the O
kidnapping O
of O
these O
two O
Italian O
girls O
is O
that O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
they O
were O
targeted O
by O
non O
- O
governmental O
volunteers O
, O
the O
ones O
who O
are O
in O
close O
contact O
with O
the O
people O
. O

It O
's O
actually O
hard O
to O
understand O
. O

And O
that O
amazes O
me O
. O

When O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
, O
a O
rocket O
fell O
in O
the O
courtyard O
near O
the O
headquarters O
of O
" O
A B-ORG
Bridge I-ORG
For I-ORG
, O
" O
I O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
upset O
, O
but O
they O
reassured O
me O
that O
it O
was O
a O
normal O
shooting O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Sadly O
, O
though O
, O
maybe O
my O
intuition O
was O
n't O
quite O
right O
. O

Where O
did O
his O
perplexity O
come O
from O
? O

For O
a O
year O
, O
our O
work O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
went O
well O
. O

But O
since O
March O
of O
this O
year O
, O
with O
the O
Al B-PER
Sadr I-PER
uprising O
in O
Falluja B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
has O
deteriorated O
. O

First O
there O
was O
the O
resistance O
of O
the O
Islamic O
matriarchate O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
get O
much O
attention O
because O
it O
was O
perceived O
by O
the O
population O
as O
a O
religious O
thing O
and O
taken O
from O
outside O
, O
and O
the O
old O
regime O
. O

These O
are O
organized O
structures O
that O
operate O
through O
heavy O
action O
, O
but O
they O
knew O
where O
to O
hit O
and O
how O
to O
hit O
. O

They O
know O
everything O
and O
everyone O
, O
and O
they O
've O
never O
attacked O
the O
Ongs O
, O
especially O
the O
ones O
that O
are O
known O
to O
be O
uncompromising O
to O
the O
occupants O
. O

Why O
, O
then O
, O
were O
the O
two O
Italian O
girls O
kidnapped O
? O

My O
first O
assumption O
was O
that O
these O
were O
not O
organized O
bad O
guys O
, O
these O
were O
bandits O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
from O
what O
I O
've O
learned O
from O
the O
Internet O
, O
the O
possibility O
arises O
that O
it O
was O
actually O
a O
targeted O
attack O
on O
us O
. O

Why O
attack O
an O
organization O
that O
, O
beyond O
every O
ideology O
and O
flag O
, O
is O
working O
hard O
to O
try O
to O
bring O
relief O
to O
its O
people O
? O

Probably O
to O
increase O
the O
emotional O
impact O
of O
their O
actions O
. O

To O
kill O
an O
Ong O
is O
to O
send O
a O
message O
that O
the O
danger O
is O
global O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
rule O
out O
the O
first O
possibility O
, O
though O
. O

Is O
there O
a O
feeling O
of O
alien O
aversion O
among O
the O
population O
? O

Until O
last O
January O
when O
I O
left O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
I O
would O
say O
no O
. O

But O
that O
was O
a O
century O
ago O
. O

So O
what O
happened O
? O

Since O
March O
, O
the O
situation O
has O
changed O
, O
and O
as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
it O
's O
deteriorating O
day O
by O
day O
. O

There O
are O
riots O
, O
there O
are O
attacks O
, O
there O
are O
kidnappings O
every O
day O
. O

If O
occupation O
was O
first O
accepted O
in O
exchange O
for O
Saddam B-PER
's O
liberation O
, O
then O
there O
was O
a O
new O
fact O
, O
which O
was O
that O
the O
winners O
of O
the O
old O
regime O
could O
not O
guarantee O
the O
security O
of O
the O
population O
and O
even O
a O
minimum O
of O
services O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
there O
's O
no O
Saddam B-PER
anymore O
, O
but O
people O
are O
still O
living O
in O
hell O
. O

This O
summer O
, O
in O
the O
heat O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
's O
hell O
, O
there O
was O
no O
water O
and O
no O
light O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
saying O
Iraqis O
apprehend O
rebels O
, O
but O
something O
has O
changed O
. O

But O
nobody O
makes O
a O
distinction O
between O
soldiers O
and O
civilians O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
primary O
goal O
is O
always O
the O
U.S. O
troops O
. O

Then O
there O
's O
the O
distinction O
between O
military O
and O
civilian O
, O
between O
NGO O
volunteers O
and O
members O
of O
the O
administration O
, O
between O
Americans O
and O
others O
. O

... O

And O
yet O
, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Simona B-PER
Pari I-PER
and O
Simona B-PER
Torretta I-PER
, O
it O
was O
n't O
like O
that O
. O

Is O
n't O
it O
that O
they O
were O
kidnapped O
for O
women O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

They O
have O
always O
been O
respectful O
of O
the O
country O
's O
traditions O
and O
religion O
, O
never O
spinning O
without O

A O
revolution O

the O
44 O
provincial O
facilities O
, O
attended O
by O
about O
3,000 O

. O

Trade O
union O
organizations O
have O
expressed O
concern O
about O
the O
lack O
of O
clarity O
in O
a O
law O
that O
spells O
out O
the O
rationalization O
of O
cost O
management O
of O
structures O
, O
actually O
equating O
them O
with O
private O
companies O
. O

They O
're O
afraid O
that O
they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
less O
service O
to O
the O
person O
and O
less O
quality O
of O
service O
to O
the O
guests O
. O

The O
Ipab B-ORG
staff O
, O
already O
inadequate O
and O
subject O
to O
excessive O
workloads O
, O
would O
also O
change O
their O
legal O
regime O
. O

So O
you O
have O
autonomous O
, O
private O
- O
sector O
contracting O
going O
on O
, O
whereas O
today O
these O
workers O
are O
embedded O
in O
the O
local O
government O
contracting O
system O
. O

The O
fear O
is O
that O
in O
the O
future O
, O
this O
could O
lead O
to O
a O
reduction O
in O
wages O
that O
are O
already O
deemed O
too O
low O
. O

Another O
controversial O
aspect O
is O
the O
position O
of O
the O
directors O
and O
CEOs O
of O
the O
Reposo O
Houses O
, O
who O
are O
now O
full O
- O
time O
employees O
, O
who O
, O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
their O
work O
, O
should O
be O
on O
waiting O
lists O
, O
to O
have O
a O
private O
- O
type O
appointment O
tied O
to O
the O
board B-ORG
of I-ORG
directors I-ORG
. O

" O
If O
the O
confrontation O
is O
missing O
-- O
the O
trade O
unions O
say O
-- O
we O
will O
mobilize O
the O
personnel O
, O
not O
excluding O
a O
protest O
demonstration O
in O
conjunction O
with O
the O
discussion O

SECOND B-PER
MARKET I-PER
ANALYSIS O

Death B-ORG

against O

always O
a O
goal O

three O

, O
15 O
goals O
made O

, O
an O
outgoing O

These O
are O
the O
numbers O
for O
the O
opening O
day O
of O
Excellence B-ORG
. O

The O
only O
two O
results O
that O
were O
a O
little O
bit O
off O
the O
grid O
were O
the O
four O
- O
zero O
- O
out O
of O
Mori B-ORG
on O
the O
Natz B-ORG
and O
the O
netless O
pair O
between O
Alense B-ORG
and O
Salorno B-ORG
. O

But O
when O
you O
look O
at O
these O
cases O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
even O
talk O
about O
gloomy O
events O
. O

that O
the O
formation O
of O
Zimelli B-PER
could O
defeat O
Natz B-ORG
was O
actually O
in O
numbers O
, O
because O
already O
last O
year O
he O
was O
on O
that O
field O
with O
a O
5 O
- O
three O
striker O
, O
and O
that O
his O
offensive O
potential O
, O
already O
strenuous O
-- O
just O
remember O
the O
115 O
goals O
of O
the O
last O
two O
decades O
-- O
is O
even O
more O
attenuated O
now O
with O
the O
intervention O
of O
the O
very O
interesting O
Romanian O
Ionut B-PER
Alecu I-PER
, O
not O
coincidentally O
immediately O
. O

Yet O
Ger O
's O
zero O
- O
to O
- O
zero O
can O
be O
called O
impossible O
. O

In O
the O
first O
outing O
of O
the O
season O
, O
it O
can O
be O
that O
a O
team O
with O
the O
same O
ambitions O
and O
the O
same O
means O
as O
Ala B-LOC
ca O
n't O
put O
under O
an O
unfinished O
and O
revolutionary O
challenge B-ORG
, O
but O
not O
least O
challenged O
. O

The O
nice O
thing O
, O
and O
the O
difficult O
thing O
, O
is O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
continue O
with O
this O
load O
of O
motivation O
and O
focus O
to O
maybe O
repeat O
the O
story O
of O
the O
Coman B-ORG
's O
miracle O
last O
year O
. O

In O
other O
fields O
, O
the O
most O
significant O
players O
are O
Albiano B-ORG
and O
Vallagarina B-ORG
, O
who O
are O
able O
to O
make O
the O
most O
of O
their O
innings O
to O
bend O
opponents O
like O
Rovereto B-ORG
and O
Merano B-ORG
. O

These O
are O
gold O
standards O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
crimes O
they O
both O
accused O
. O

Mulchanders B-PER
, O
Brothers B-PER
, O
Nicolodes B-PER
, O
Valentinians B-PER
, O
the O
rednecks O
of O
Memmo B-PER
, O
the O
badgers B-PER
of O
Cornwall O
and O
Contines B-PER
, O
the O
rednecks O
of O
Melone B-PER
. O

On O
the O
subject O
of O
heavy O
weapons O
, O
there O
's O
something O
that O
even O
Benacense B-ORG
complains O
about O
, O
which O
is O
that O
in O
the O
big O
Ponte B-LOC
Arche I-LOC
match O
, O
he O
had O
to O
give O
up O
two O
players O
like O
Delnegro B-PER
, O
and O
what O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
twist O
on O
the O
traditionally O
stronger O
drawn O
division O
of O
the O
tournament O
, O
that O
of O
Coman B-ORG
Fiavè I-ORG
. O

So O
it O
's O
almost O
possible O
that O
the O
mail O
goes O
away O
without O
any O
real O
emotion O
. O

Also O
very O
promising O
is O
Brixen B-ORG

few O
days O

it O

moving O

moving O

Ramon B-PER

a O
quadriplegic O
who O
's O
been O
in O
bed O
for O
18 O
years O
, O
and O
he O
's O
trying O
to O
get O
his O
euthanasia O
. O

Ramon B-PER
was O
played O
by O
Javier B-PER
Bardem I-PER
, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
actors O
you O
can O
find O
on O
film O
sets O
around O
the O
world O
. O

A O
fleeting O
movement O
of O
the O
face O
, O
an O
inflection O
of O
the O
voice O
, O
is O
enough O
for O
Bardem B-PER
to O
open O
up O
a O
world O
, O
to O
evoke O
a O
flood O
of O
emotions O
. O

The O
subject O
is O
death O
, O
and O
the O
legal O
battle O
to O
get O
permission O
to O
go O
on O
to O
sweet O
death O
is O
very O
hard O
. O

More O
than O
the O
legal O
and O
the O
civil O
side O
, O
the O
film O
focuses O
mainly O
on O
the O
human O
dimension O
of O
the O
person O
who O
decided O
to O
end O

The O
need O
to O
reinvent O
the O
organization O
of O
the O
Thirty B-ORG
Federation I-ORG
of I-ORG
Cooperatives I-ORG
stems O
from O
the O
desire O
of O
the O
board O
of O

, O
the O

of O
the O

, O
to O
adapt O
and O
improve O
the O
services O
rendered O
by O
Segantini B-ORG
to O
almost O
600 O
associates O
. O

THE O
METHOD O
. O

It O
's O
going O
to O
be O
the O
Segantini B-ORG
HQ O
that O
's O
going O
to O
oversee O
and O
approve O
the O
three O
- O
year O
improvement O
program O
that O
's O
going O
to O
come O
out O
in O
three O
phases O
. O

The O
first O
one O
is O
listening O
to O
the O
internal O
structure O
at O
Segantini B-ORG
Street I-ORG
, O
and O
the O
external O
structure O
-- O
the O
cooperatives O
, O
the O
consortia O
, O
but O
also O
the O
actors O
in O
the O
30s O
. O

The O
second O
is O
the O
diagnosis O
that O
will O
lead O
to O
the O
actual O
program O
. O

The O
third O
is O
monitoring O
and O
verification O
. O

TEMPI O
. O

The O
forecast O
says O
the O
project O
will O
be O
published O
in O
January O
and O
implemented O
in O
February O
. O

So O
by O
that O
date O
, O
the O
internal O

minutes O

realize O

I O
was O
going O

make O
it O

The O
spray O
had O
a O
particular O
effect O

big O

would O
you O
have O
imagined O
all O
this O

In O

all O
the O
affection O

I O
would O
say O

that O
now O

right O

I O
knew O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
I O
did O
well O
in O
the O

if O
I O
even O
won O

it O
all O
happened O
there O

in O

the O

were O
born O

with O
that O
extraordinary O
climate O
that O
was O
created O

made O
up O
of O

why O
was O
this O
the O

that O

also O

do O
you O

counted O
your O

a O
good O

" O
Sure O

Before O
Athens O
, O
I O
was O
not O

they O
knew O
me O
very O
little O
, O
and O
you O
know O
why O
? O

" O

I O
have O
an O
idea O

" O
Because O
I O
'm O
too O
normal O

too O
good O

And O
that O
bothered O
me O
a O

no O
, O
dear O
Stefano B-PER
, O
you O
do O

I O

counterintuitive O

how O
far O
have O
I O
come O
in O

I O
went O
under O
two O
hours O
11 O
times O

10 O

my O
best O
three O

are O
all O
better O

you O

you O

can O

goal O

it O
would O
be O
good O

just O

on O

The O
Helsinki B-LOC
track O
is O
a O
little O

less O
challenging O
than O
the O

there O

allow O

about O
the O
Beijing B-LOC

? O

" O
I O
see O
them O
so O
far O
away O

Then O
they O
spend O
four O
years O
in O

I O
do O

about O
it O

" O

Will O
you O
be O
there O

I O
felt O
the O
pressure O

the O
tension O

going O
out O

Two O

two O

so O
they O
also O

make O

about O

" O
My O
opinion O
is O
that O
you O
have O
to O
follow O
the O
rules O

and O
if O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
in O

then O
you O
should O
n't O

" O

For O
him O
, O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
allow O
Muslim O
women O
to O
respect O
their O
religious O
beliefs O
, O
there O
would O
be O
another O
solution O

" O
In O

, O
there O
are O
mixed O
pools O

also O
pools O

only O

If O
you O
can O
introduce O
this O
system O
in O
Italy B-LOC

, O
why O
not O
? O

As O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
, O
it O
's O
not O
against O
the O
law O

" O

But O
if O
the O
reservoirs O

, O
" O
Well O

my O
advice O
is O
not O
to O
go O

" O
There O
are O
two O
aspects O
to O
this O

one O
cultural O
and O
one O
hygienic O

For O
cultural O
reasons O

he O

I O
remember O
our O

going O

the O

completely O

from O
the O
head O
down O
, O
in O
complete O
costumes O

suits O
have O
become O
cheaper O
and O
cheaper O
. O

As O
far O
as O
hygiene O
is O
concerned O
, O
it O
's O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
waiting O
in O
the O
sink O
to O
wash O
these O
clothes O
, O
these O
tubs O
, O
before O
entering O
the O
water O

You O
have O
to O
take O
a O
proper O
shower O
before O
you O
go O
into O
the O
swimming O
pool O
. O

But O
sometimes O
it O
's O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
filters O
. O

Until O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
headscarf O
was O
mandatory O
. O
" O

The O
mayor O
of O

regretted O
the O
decision O

there O

been O

If O
there O

would O

At O

as O

as O

which O
are O
pretty O
much O
the O
definitive O

from O
the O

the O

The O
overall O
growth O

was O
6.5 O

that O

always O
2.3 O

But O
the O

This O
year O
, O
the O
route O
of O
the O

still O
changes O
slightly O
, O
following O
an O
old O
detour O
that O
in O
Someda B-LOC
does O
not O
guarantee O
the O
innocence O

, O
and O
so O
Riccardo B-PER
Taroni I-PER
, O
the O
patron O

in O
Italy O
, O
was O
forced O
to O
find O
a O
variant O
, O
which O
is O
not O
said O
to O
remain O
fixed O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Basically O
, O
after O
the O
repeated O
rise O
of O
the O
moon O
and O
the O
subsequent O
fall O
, O
the O
track O
does O
n't O
bend O

, O
it O
comes O
back O

shortly O
before O
the O
country O

gone O
back O
to O
Sodom B-LOC

The O
total O
length O
of O
the O
track O
is O
now O
reduced O
to O
40 O
kilometers O
, O
and O
the O
drop O
- O
off O
to O
1,783 O
meters O
, O
certainly O
not O
a O
significant O
increase O
, O
which O
is O
also O
going O
to O
be O
of O
interest O
to O
Rampimidi O
values O
, O
going O
to O
14.6 O
kilometers O
of O
track O
and O
841 O
meters O
of O
drop O
- O
off O
. O

There O
are O
3,000 O

for O
the O

on O

the O

and O
there O

only O
one O
left O

" O

But O
Saronni B-PER
does O
n't O
really O
like O
this O
policy O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
lion O

part O
, O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
the O
economic O
support O
of O
the O

, O
will O
be O
Emanuele B-PER
Galbusera I-PER

, O
then O
the O

will O

Blue O

of O
the O
historic O

Even O
though O
, O
if O
you O
look O
at O
the O
technical O
nature O
of O
the O
organs O
in O
Lampre B-ORG
and O
Saeco B-ORG
, O
the O
diminution O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
men O
in O
red O
would O
seem O
justified O
, O
here O
's O
why O
it O
's O
normal O
for O
the O
men O
in O
Lampre B-ORG
to O
have O
a O
certain O
reluctance O
to O
accept O
this O
division O

So O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
wait O
for O

sides O

find O

that O

for O

I O
was O

I O
did O

all O

told O
me O
that O
after O

surely O
there O
would O
be O
something O

pay O
for O
, O

that O

I O
entered O
the O
apartment O
in O
July O
1996 O
. O

Already O
the O
following O
month O
, O
there O
was O
talk O
of O
contract O
debts O
to O
build O
the O
building O
that O
I O
lived O
in O
. O

At O
first O
, O
though O
, O
it O
seemed O
like O
a O
few O
million O
. O

We O
went O
on O
like O
this O
, O
in O
uncertainty O
, O
until O
December O
' O
96 O
. O

That O
's O
when O
the O
CSC B-ORG
chiefs O
told O
us O
that O
the O
liabilities O
on O
my O
building O
were O
800 O
million O
pounds O
. O

There O
are O
18 O
apartments O
in O
the O
entire O
building O
, O
so O
the O
debt O
for O
each O
of O
us O
was O
about O
40 O
million O
pounds O
. O

That O
's O
more O
money O
we O
had O
to O
spend O
than O
we O
had O
been O
paid O
to O
do O
that O
. O

They O
told O
us O
that O
that O
debt O
had O
been O
accumulated O
because O
the O
provincial O
funding O
had O
come O
late O
and O
they O
had O
to O
borrow O
money O
from O
the O
banking O
market O
. O

We O
checked O
all O
the O
mortgages O
that O
could O
n't O
have O
gone O
this O
way O
, O
because O
otherwise O
, O
the O
interest O
would O
have O
been O
so O
high O
. O

Anyway O
, O
the O
CSC B-ORG
asked O
for O
20 O
million O
right O
away O
and O
another O
20 O
million O
at O
monthly O
rates O
. O

There O
was O
no O
insurance O
, O
though O
, O
that O
would O
have O
been O
the O
last O
one O
. O

We O
decided O
not O
to O
pay O
. O

The O
following O
year O
, O
other O
interventions O
started O
to O
fail O
. O

The O
situation O
precipitated O
in O
just O
a O
few O
months O
to O
' O
99 O
when O
there O
was O
already O
four O
or O
five O
billion O
pounds O
in O
debt O
. O

In O
order O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
, O
in O
2000 O
, O
the O
CSC B-ORG
executives O
asked O
and O
obtained O
a O
third O
mortgage O
on O
all O
of O
their O
property O
. O

So O
it O
became O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
possible O
to O
repay O
all O
of O
that O
money O
. O

And O
then O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2001 O
, O
the O
CSC B-ORG
was O
liquidated O
, O
and O
the O
debt O
came O
to O
14 O
billion O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O

and O

other O

at O

building O
who O
had O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O

Recently O

met O

Andreolli I-PER
to O

an O

to O
some O
of O

raised O
at O

time O
by O
the O
association O
about O
compliance O
with O
section O
194 O
on O
interruption O
of O

the O

. O

One O
of O
the O
major O
inconveniences O
reported O
was O
very O
long O
wait O
times O
for O
abortion O
in O
the O
public O
sector O
. O

" O
The O
forensic O
data O
from O
2003 O
by O
the O
evaluator O
-- O
says O
a O
statement O
from O
the O
association O
-- O
says O
49 O
percent O
of O
the O
interventions O
at O
Santa O
Chiara O
Hospital O
are O
performed O
after O
21 O
days O
, O
while O
Villa B-ORG

36.2 O

five O

nine O
days O

40 O
percent O
within O
10 O
to O
15 O
days O

" O

So O
it O
's O
the O
private O
sector O
that O
contributes O
most O
of O
the O
interventions O
( O
763 O
out O
of O
1,238 O
, O
or O
61.7 O
percent O
) O
. O

The O
reason O
? O

Most O
of O
the O
interventions O
in O
the O
public O
sector O
are O
targeted O
at O
Mr. O
Chiara O
, O
who O
nevertheless O
only O
dedicates O
one O
day O
a O
week O
to O
you O
, O
as O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
the O
only O
structure O
with O
a O
relatively O
small O
number O
of O
targets O
. O

In O
other O
30s O
hospitals O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
targets O
are O
much O
larger O
in O
percentage O
terms O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
but O
also O
for O
other O
issues O
, O
the O
Coordination B-ORG
has O
encouraged O
Andreolli B-PER
to O
move O
from O

at O

Talk O
about O

It O
's O
in O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
committee O
today O
that O
the O
research O
reform O
text O
produced O
by O
advisor O
Gianluca B-PER
Salvatori I-PER
comes O
out O
. O

The O
reform O
envisions O
the O
transformation O
of O
the O
ITC B-ORG
and O
the O
San B-ORG
Michele I-ORG
Agricultural I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
into O
foundations O
, O
and O
the O
introduction O
of O
greater O
autonomy O
and O
flexibility O
in O
research O
work O
. O

Less O
political O
nominees O
, O
more O
expertise O
- O
related O
choices O
. O

In O
a O
word O
: O

more O
transparency O
. O

So O
that O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
guiding O
principle O
of O
the O
provincial O
reform O
law O
that O
will O
transform O
the O
ITC B-ORG
, O
and O
its O
statute O
, O
into O
the O
Bruno B-ORG
Kessler I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
, O
in O
honor O
of O
its O
founder O
. O

" O
There O
is O
less O
complete O
discretion O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
board O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
nominating O
people O
for O
their O
expertise O
, O
" O
says O
innovation O
thinker O
Gianluca B-PER
Salvatori I-PER
. O

" O
This O
choice O
demonstrates O
how O
overwhelming O
the O
objections O
are O
about O
the O
risk O
of O
undermining O
the O
autonomy O
of O
the O
entity O
, O
" O
adds O
Salvatori B-PER
. O

So O
the O
old O
non O
- O
written O
rules O
on O
party O
nominations O
are O
deleted O
from O
the O
ones O
that O
guarantee O
a O
more O
consistent O
balance O
between O
the O
goals O
of O
the O
institute B-ORG
now O
, O
and O
the O
foundation B-ORG

And O
yet O
, O
a O
couple O
of O

he O
got O
home O
the O

What O
happened O
? O

That O
late O
May O
night O
, O
the O
bus O
driver O
who O
was O
in O
the O
bus O
stopped O
a O
stranger O
who O
had O
provided O
false O
information O
, O
giving O
the O
name O
and O
surname O
of O
Marco B-PER
. O

The O
Trentino B-ORG
Transportation I-ORG
Authority O
did O
n't O
ask O
him O
for O
an O
identity O
document O
-- O
it O
's O
actually O
written O
on O
the O
contravention O
-- O
and O
so O
the O
stranger O
was O
able O
to O
get O
it O
straight O
. O

If O
we O
needed O
a O
second O
confirmation O
that O
the O
boy O
on O
the O
bus O
was O
n't O
Marco B-PER
, O
here O
's O
the O
wording O
: O
a O
locked O
- O
in O
address O
, O
wrong O
birth O
date O
and O
a O
signature O
completely O
different O
from O
his O
. O

And O
yet O
, O
at O
home O
, O
the O
fine O
was O
there O
, O
and O
somehow O
the O
matter O
had O
to O
be O
resolved O
. O

" O
The O
controller O
-- O
and O
he O
's O
right O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
protagonist O
of O
the O

wrote O

without O
documenting O
the O
authenticity O
of O
the O
generals O
provided O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O

So O
now O
I O
have O
to O
answer O
for O
an O
offense O
committed O
by O
another O
person O
who O
, O
on O
the O

repeatedly O
gave O

the O

It O

, O
it O

going O
to O
take O
a O
long O
time O
before O
the O
whole O
thing O
is O
over O

explained O
to O

, O
it O
takes O
about O

" O

The O
fact O
, O
by O
the O
end O
of O
this O
long O

is O
that O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
there O

not O
enough O
to O

afternoon O

for O
many O

been O
suffering O
from O

so O
much O
so O
that O
in O
1979 O
, O
she O
shot O
at O
the O
door O
of O
her O
neighbor O

The O
assault O
was O
first O
verbal O

with O
the O
vengeance O

accusing O
the O
unfortunate O
girl O

putting O
something O
on O

back O

it O
became O
very O

very O
violent O

brute O
had O
hit O

victim O
repeatedly O
on O
the O
back O

the O
poor O

was O
defending O
herself O
with O

Health B-ORG

According O
to O
actors O
' O
law O
, O
the O
reason O
for O
liability O
lies O
in O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
health B-ORG

to O
comply O
with O
its O
obligation O
to O
prevent O

, O
in O

, O
could O
prevent O
the O

That O
is O

the O

since O
, O
according O
to O
the O
aggressor O

her O

she O
had O

she O
had O
repeatedly O
shown O

The O
perpetrator O
at O
the O
time O
was O
actually O
undergoing O
psychiatric O
medical O
treatment O
right O
by O
the O
health B-ORG

His O
state O
of O
mind O
, O
characterized O
by O
violence O
and O
aggression O
, O
had O
already O
begun O
to O
manifest O
itself O
in O
1979 O

when O
he O
shot O
from O
the O
window O

his O
home O

the O
home O

the O

health B-ORG

had O
never O
done O
anything O
to O

The O
aggressor O
was O
already O
suffering O
from O
a O
real O
delirium O
of O
persecution O
. O

That O
's O
why O
he O
assaulted O
the O

accusing O
her O

It O
also O
revealed O
the O

started O

, O
in O

he O
threw O
openly O
at O

" O
I O

went O

the O

pushed O
back O

yesterday O
, O
he O
justified O
his O
protest O
against O
the O
paper O
cuts O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
majority O

agreed O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
take O
away O
from O
their O

The O

Consequently O

the O

decided O

even O

signs O
the O
amendments O
with O
the O
Italian B-ORG
Force I-ORG
and O
we O
do O
n't O

because O
this O
is O

Study O
and O
Advisory O
Fund O
-- O
The O
amendment O
provides O
for O
a O
fund O
to O
be O
established O
in O
the O
provincial O
budget O
for O
groups O
to O
conduct O
studies O
. O

The O
fund O
, O
according O
to O
the O
proposal O
put O
forward O
by O
the O
Sdr B-ORG
, O
embracing O
a O
revival B-ORG
of O
Catalan O
, O
is O
allocated O
half O
to O
minority O
groups O
and O
half O
to O
majority O
groups O
. O

Each O
group O
will O
have O
to O
indicate O
their O
supported O
spending O
and O
their O
funded O
studies O
. O

But O
how O
much O
money O
will O
this O
fund O
? O

It O
's O
likely O
that O
for O
this O
year O
, O
as O
proposed O
by O
a O
Catalan B-PER
agenda O
, O
resources O
will O
be O
sought O
from O
other O
sources O
in O
the O
budget O
, O
without O
increasing O
spending O
, O
but O
of O
course O
that O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
the O
case O
for O
the O
next O
budgets O
. O

Remuneration O
-- O
The O
cross O
- O
party O
agreement O
provides O
for O
a O
new O
staffing O
table O
for O
the O
groups O
, O
allowing O
for O
the O
hiring O
of O
five O
additional O
people O
-- O
an O
estimated O
cost O
of O
250,000 O
euros O
-- O
at O
the O
D O
level O
. O

It O
also O
proposes O
to O
increase O
the O
payroll O
of O
its O
employees O
by O
25 O
percent O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
group O
's O
staff O
are O
35 O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
asks O
for O
council B-ORG
employees O
to O
have O
a O
self O
- O
insured O
seat O
as O
well O
. O

Travel O
-- O
Today O
the O
regulations O
provide O
for O
travel O
of O
about O
6,000 O
kilometers O
reimbursable O
to O
each O
counselor O
. O

But O
a O
lot O
of O
consultants O
do O
n't O
use O
them O
and O
do O
n't O
ask O
for O
a O
fee O
. O

So O
what O
the O
groups O
are O
proposing O
is O
that O
instead O
of O
dividing O
the O
miles O
between O
the O
advisers O
, O
that O
all O
of O
the O
medical O
care O
can O
be O
run O
by O
the O
headquarters O
group O
, O
who O
will O
allocate O
the O
miles O
according O
to O
the O
needs O
. O

So O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
easier O
to O
use O
them O
all O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
chiefs O
of O
staff O
will O
be O
able O
to O
ask O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
board B-ORG
for O
additional O
political O
missions O
. O

Accountability O
-- O
The O
only O
thing O
left O
for O
the O
Sinistra O
group O
was O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
transparent O
accountability O
of O
how O
the O
resources O
were O
used O
by O
the O
groups O
. O

Margherita B-ORG
-- O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
far O

accept O
only O

does O
not O

" O
After O

Zandonella B-PER

The O

Giuseppe B-PER

proposal O

a O
legislative O
initiative O
in O
the O

into O
an O
opportunity O
for O

This O
is O
a O
proposal O

follows O
on O
from O

was O

launched O
by O
the O

the O
innocent O
victims O
of O
Beslan B-LOC

on O
the O
other O
hand O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
: O

" O
Religions O
can O
never O
use O
the O
name O
of O
God B-PER
to O
teach O
hatred O

When O
religion O
serves O
to O
justify O
hatred O
, O
it O
's O
a O
travesty O
of O

On O
the O

of O
October O
8th O
, O
the O
date O
that O
the O
CDL B-ORG
set O

the O

, O
there O
are O
about O
20 O

It O
's O
because O
of O
the O
obstructionism O
of O
the O

, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
also O
because O
of O
the O
D.C. B-ORG

which O
, O
especially O
in O
these O
pre O

hours O
, O
is O
not O

A O

, O
always O
called O
to O
this O

, O

set O

But O
there O
are O
people O
in O
the O
DRC B-ORG
who O
make O
sure O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
go O
beyond O
October O
15th O
. O

The O
time O
allocated O
to O
the O
centre O
- O
right O
is O
already O
running O
out O
, O
and O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
Chamber B-ORG
, O
Pier B-PER
Ferdinando I-PER
Casini I-PER
, O
has O
already O
given O
the O

110 O

" O

" O

In O
the O

, O
the O

concern O
the O

Reform O
Minister O
Roberto B-PER
Calderoli I-PER
is O
also O
working O
on O
the O
final O
touches O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
legislative O
iteration O
. O

still O
the O
real O
node O
of O
reform O
. O

After O
meeting O
with O
Prime O
Minister O
Berlusconi B-PER
and O
the O
Senate O
last O
night O
, O
the O
Minister O
of O
Agriculture B-ORG
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
We O
have O
found O
the O
square O
, O
the O
legislation O
has O
been O
approved O
for O
a O
final O
text O
. O

There O
are O
no O
formalities O
, O
but O
a O
balance O
has O
been O
struck O
between O
the O
governance O
of O
the O
country O
and O
the O
autonomy O
of O
the O
chambers O
. O
" O

In O
summary O
, O
what O
he O
proposed O
is O
that O
the O
House B-ORG
should O
have O
the O
final O
say O
on O
bills O
that O
deal O
with O
matters O
of O
exclusive O
state O
competence O
. O

But O
it O
can O
also O
make O
the O
final O
decision O
if O
the O
government O
insists O
on O
making O
changes O
that O
are O
deemed O
essential O
to O
implement O
the O
program O
that O
the O
Senate B-ORG
does O
n't O
share O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
prime O
minister O
will O
be O
allowed O
by O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
to O
make O
his O
or O
her O
own O
argument O
. O

And O
then O
to O
decide O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
House B-ORG
will O
vote O
with O
an O
absolute O
majority O
. O

The O
prediction O
is O
that O
a O
parliamentary O
committee O
will O
have O
to O
come O
up O
with O
a O
new O
text O
if O
, O
in O
the O
bicameral O
process O
, O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
do O
n't O
speak O
out O
properly O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
nine B-ORG
- O
member O
committee O
is O
awaiting O
the O
response O
to O
a O
question O
raised O
in O
the O
auditorium O
by O
the O
head O
of O
the O
faculty O
, O
Dr. B-ORG
Luciano B-PER
Violante I-PER
, O
concerning O
the O
definition O
of O
the O
Head O
of O
State O
as O
" O
the O
representative O
of O
the O
federal O
unity O
of O
the O
nation O
. O
" O

A O
definition O
that O
the O
president O
of O
Congress O
, O
Luciano B-PER
Violantè I-PER
, O
has O
coined O
as O
a O
" O
civil O
beast O
, O
" O
and O
has O
made O
the O
opposition O
scream O
out O
in O
outrage O
. O

Even O
yesterday O
the O
auditorium O
showed O
signs O
of O
nervousness O
. O

As O
the O
reaction O
of O
ds O
Soda B-PER
demonstrates O
, O
which O
was O
provoked O
by O
some O
bishops O
, O
is O
ultimately O
crushed O
. O

" O
I O
know O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
a O
c O
-- O
but O
time O
is O
racing O

the O

The O

So O
a O
marginal O

the O

her O

, O
so O
it O
's O
all O
too O
easy O
with O
one O
of O
these O
. O

But O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
goals O
and O
targets O
, O
it O
takes O
away O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
visibility O
. O

And O
then O
he O
goes O
all O
- O
out O
. O

Does O
n't O
that O
make O
you O
a O
little O
jealous O
? O

But O
it O
's O
also O
a O
comfortable O
situation O
. O

If O
everybody O
thinks O
about O
stopping O
him O
, O
there O
's O
more O
opportunity O
for O
others O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
rigors O
are O
concerned O
, O
it O
's O
fair O
that O
he O
beats O
them O
, O
because O
he O
's O
a O
specialist O
, O
and O
I O
like O
to O
sign O
on O
to O
action O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
perfectly O
comfortable O
with O
that O
. O

What O
should O
be O
the O
goal O
this O
year O
? O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
confirm O
the O
15 O
goals O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
big O
success O
. O

It O
's O
going O
to O
be O
hard O
-- O

But O
is O
there O
a O
secret O
to O
your O
rehearsal O
centers O
? O

Yes O
, O
luck O
. O

Too O
easy O
. O

People O
say O
it O
's O
because O
you O
lost O
your O
passion O
for O
Pope B-PER
Winnie I-PER
-- O

Well O
, O
that O
's O
not O
new O
to O
me O
. O

You O
talked O
to O
somebody O
on O
the O
team O
, O
right O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
like O
all O
those O
kinds O
of O
things O
-- O
African O
, O
reggae O
, O
happy O
sound O
. O

It O
empowers O
me O
and O
makes O
me O
play O
better O
. O

Do O
n't O
write O
it O
down O
, O
but O
do O
you O
know O
how O
many O
times O
I O
've O
recorded O
after O
a O
disco O
night O
with O
these O
rhythms O
? O

Clearly O
I O
do O
n't O
write O
it O
. O

But O
on O
Saturday O
night O
, O
the O
good O
footballer O
goes O
to O
bed O
early O
, O
right O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
or O
at O
least O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
run O
out O
. O

It O
takes O
measuring O
everything O
. O

Let O

go O
back O

Who O
wins O

? O

If O

to O
make O

, O
I O
just O

was O

when O
in O

the O

, O
who O

now O
28 O
, O
fell O
down O

of O
a O

The O
young O

was O
rescued O
by O
the O
118th B-ORG

and O
transferred O
to O
the O
Villa O
Igea O

where O
the O
doctors O
diagnosed O
him O
with O
a O
tibia O

. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
the O
patient O
underwent O
surgery O
to O
reduce O
the O
fracture O
with O
osteoporosis O
, O
which O
is O
to O
put O
a O
titanium O
limb O
onto O
the O
fracture O
. O

On O
April O
2 O
, O
the O
young O
man O
was O
fired O
. O

now O
seemed O
to O
be O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
rapid O
recovery O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
like O
that O
. O

In O
June O
, O
the O
wound O
showed O
signs O
of O
infection O
. O

On O
July O
29 O
, O
1999 O
, O
the O
student O
returned O
to O
Villa O

where O
they O
were O
diagnosed O
with O
osteoporosis O
. O

They O
needed O
a O
new O
surgery O
to O
remove O
them O
, O
followed O
by O
antibiotic O
therapy O
. O

But O
instead O
of O
solving O
the O
problem O
, O
it O
became O
a O
real O
mess O
. O

the O
wound O
did O
n't O
heal O
, O
but O
he O
was O
still O
infected O
. O

The O
patient O
began O
a O
painful O
walk O
between O
medical O
centers O
and O
specialists O
in O
northern O
Italy O
. O

His O
life O
was O
in O

no O

which O

the O

So O
on O
July O
31 O
, O
2002 O
, O
so O
over O
three O
years O
after O
the O

Of O

, O
the O

immediate O

over O
the O

, O
the O

eventually O
did O
come O

Today O

the O

the O

Parents O

" O
The O
families O
knew O
nothing O
about O

" O

At O
the O
beginning O
, O
there O
were O
seven O
families O
who O
had O
come O
forward O
to O
challenge O
Ms. O
N.D. B-PER

teaching O

When O
the O
protest O
became O
more O
lively O
and O
the O
prospect O
of O
a O
retreat O
became O
more O
concrete O
, O
two O
of O
them O
gave O
up O
. O

But O
the O
initiative O
did O
n't O
lose O
its O
momentum O
. O

The O
arguments O
of O
those O
parents O
, O
who O
did O
not O
like O
the O
" O

that O
the O

Maria B-PER

who O

And O
so O
it O
was O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
parents O
, O
who O
were O
active O
to O
get O
the O
teacher O
removed O
and O
put O
in O
another O
job O
, O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
talk O
. O

" O
What O
the O
manager O
said O
is O
what O
we O
think O
. O

Call O
her O
. O
" O

So O
let O
's O
face O
it O
. O

The O
manager O
was O
searched O
in O
various O
offices O
, O
more O
messages O
were O
sent O
, O
but O
she O
did O
n't O
get O
heard O
. O

No O
one O
called O
the O
paper O
to O
explain O
the O
reasons O
for O
a O
choice O
that O
satisfied O
some O
and O
angered O
others O
. O

She O
talks O
, O
but O
with O
the O
promise O
of O
anonymity O
, O
a O
mother O
: O

" O
My O
kids O
are O
going O
to O
school O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
any O
repercussions O
, O
because O
that O
teacher O
is O
still O
working O
. O
" O

He O
does O
n't O
fear O
that O
now O
, O
with O
a O
new O
supplement O
, O
the O
quality O
of O
teaching O
can O
be O
improved O
. O

" O
For O
years O
now O
, O
my O
son O
has O
been O
going O
to O
school O
with O
extracurricular O
teachers O
. O

It O
's O
better O
in O
the O
end O
. O
" O

But O
does O
this O
distrust O
arise O
from O
the O
sexuality O
education O
lesson O
? O

" O
The O
talk O
is O
much O
broader O
. O

We O
as O
a O
family O
are O
not O
against O
sexuality O
education O
, O
in O
fact O
. O

The O
point O
is O
, O
that O
lesson O
was O
given O
without O
our O
warning O
. O

They O
've O
been O
used O
too O
explicitly O
, O
which O
to O
a O
child O
, O
we O
think O
, O
is O
not O
good O
. O

And O
it O
's O
not O
about O
being O
bigots O

I O
warned O

Ceola B-PER
: O

" O
It O

scandalous O

cheat O
at O
these O
rates O
. O
" O

Suggest O
city O

: O
Four O

by O
the O
Trentino B-ORG
staff O
, O
of O
the O
passengers O
who O

" O
It O
's O
a O
contentious O
percentage O
compared O
to O
other O
national O
realities O
, O
and O
that O
, O
if O
we O
want O
to O
, O
is O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
we O
're O
happy O
with O
, O
" O
says O
President O
Vanni B-PER
Ceola I-PER
. O

The O
case O
of O
the O
kid O
who O
gave O
the O
inspector O
who O
had O
begun O
drinking O
without O
a O
ticket O
the O
name O
of O
another O
, O
reported O
yesterday O
by O
L'Adige B-ORG
, O
is O
not O
new O
at O
all O
. O

It O
happens O
at O
a O
certain O
frequency O
, O
and O
it O
's O
something O
that O
puts O
the O
public O
transportation O
company O
number O
one O
on O
the O
line O
. O

" O
It O
's O
outrageous O
that O
a O
kid O
names O
another O
kid O
and O
does O
n't O
buy O
a O
subscription O
that O
costs O
52 O
euros O
a O
year O
. O

A O
misery O
compared O
to O
other O
national O
realities O
. O

In O
Verona B-LOC
, O
for O
example O
, O
you O
pay O
between O
22 O
euros O
and O
78 O
euros O
a O
month O
for O
commuting O
. O

Compared O
to O
that O
, O
our O
prices O
make O
us O
laugh O
. O
" O

But O
beyond O
the O
tariffs O
, O
which O
have O
raised O
a O
great O
deal O
in O
the O
last O
few O
weeks O
at O
the O
provincial O
level O
, O
it O
's O
amazing O
that O
the O
inspector O
trusted O
the O
boy O
's O
name O
and O
did O
n't O
look O
for O
a O
response O
in O
an O
official O
document O
. O

" O
But O
the O
problem O
, O
" O
Ceola B-PER
explains O
, O
" O
is O
that O
a O
teenager O
can O
also O
not O
have O
the O
document O

, O
if O
he O

And O
there O

Ruggero B-PER

52 O

The O
man O

charged O
with O
violating O

following O
the O

The O
verdict O
sets O
an O
important O
precedent O
, O
and O
in O
some O
ways O
helps O
to O
reassure O
the O
presidents O
of O
particularly O
overwhelming O
sections O

If O
the O
vengeance O

leads O
not O
only O
to O
the O
completion O

actually O
to O
the O
implementation O
of O
the O
reduction O
plan O
on O
the O
first O
day O
of O
hunting O
, O
the O
responsibility O
can O
not O
be O
assigned O
to O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O

Judge O
Carlo B-PER
Ancona I-PER
pointed O
out O
in O
that O
ruling O
that O
hunters O
can O
not O
be O
punished O
because O
they O
can O
not O
be O
informed O
in O
real O
time O
about O
the O
downsizing O

Similarly O
, O
the O
president O
ca O
n't O
be O
punished O

because O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
tools O

the O

The O
chief O
of O

that O

countermeasures O
such O
as O

the O

the O

met O
to O
discuss O
more O
open O
issues O
: O

Areas O

the O
Vela O
proposal O
. O

Probably O
rejected O
by O
the O
president O
of O
Redolfi B-PER
County O
, O
" O
because O
geologically O
, O
it O
's O
not O
the O
right O
place O

and O
most O
importantly O
, O
the O
county B-LOC

" O

Fabiano B-PER
Condini I-PER
, O
of O
the O
committee O
, O
summed O
up O
the O
news O
very O
positively O
, O
" O
because O
, O
given O
its O
location O
, O
it O
puts O
it O
in O
the O
spotlight O
. O
" O

Another O
subject O
of O
debate O
is O
the O
proposed O
action O
plan O
for O
the O
area O
that O
includes O
the O
former O
African O
Missions O
, O
the O
headquarters O
of O
the O
newspaper O
L'Adige B-ORG
, O
and O
the O
underlying O
terrain O
. O

Then O
came O
the O
Berland O
case O
. O

Margherita B-ORG
's O
adviser O
put O
forward O
three O
separate O
agendas O
that O
were O
largely O
inconsistent O
, O
provoking O
angry O
reactions O
in O
some O
of O
her O
allies O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
he O
touched O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
" O
hot O
tax O
" O
on O
the O
way O
to O
the B-LOC
Alberta I-LOC
, O
drawing O
attention O
to O
the O
original O
proposal O
, O
which O
was O
for O
private O
land O
to O
be O
ceded O
to O
public O
utilities O
in O
exchange O
for O
building O
capacity O
. O

Another O
counter O
- O
proposal O
is O
to O
scrap O
the O
proposed O
modifications O
to O
the O
hotel O
sector O
on O
Bondone B-LOC
, O
so O
as O
to O
avoid O
expensive O
leasing O
of O
old O
, O
abandoned O
buildings O
, O
a O
move O
that O
, O
in O
his O
view O
, O
would O
not O
be O
unpleasant O
to O
the O
owners O
. O

The O
third O
item O
on O
the O
agenda O
is O
identifying O
areas O
for O

Three O
other O
proposals O
were O
put O
forward O
by O
Roberto B-PER

They O
're O
all O
about O

As O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
Vicenza O
Bridge O
, O
one O
of O
the O

where O
the O
decision O
is O
made O
to O
replace O
the O
existing O
device O
with O
a O
new O
metal O
body O

The O
project O
will O
cost O
a O
total O

The O
work O
, O
which O
will O
start O

of O
the O
Vicenza O

September O
, O
and O
will O
therefore O
involve O
roadworthiness O
interventions O
that O
deviate O
from O
the O
current O
path O
. O

The O
project O
envisions O
the O
extension O
of O
the O

with O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O
centralized O
expressway O
to O
improve O

The O
first O
is O
the O
construction O

To O

go O

yesterday O

up O

Yesterday O
at O
midnight O
, O
just O
to O
give O
you O
an O
idea O
, O
the O
Council B-ORG
was O
almost O
in O
full O
swing O
, O
hoping O
that O
maybe O
Sergio B-PER

Duracell I-PER
would O
collapse O
. O

No O

no O

no O

no O

But O
, O
you O
know O
, O
with O
the O
hope O
that O
the O
scribe O
would O
run O
out O
of O
battery O
behind O
his O
back O
, O
that O
he O
'd O
go O
home O
and O
that O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
approve O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
-- O
and O
the O
darkness O
can O
obscure O
even O
the O
cruelest O
aspects O
-- O
the O
reform O
of O
the O
governance O
, O
but O
most O
importantly O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
painful O
reform O
of O
the O
advisory O
groups O
. O

So O
, O
Sergio B-PER
-- I-PER
Duracell I-PER
is O
trying O
to O
block O
these O
two O
approvals O
. O

Contrary O
to O
the O
whole O
line O
. O

The O
two O
possibilities O
are O
enshrined O
in O
about O
2,000 O
amendments O
, O
which O
the O
indomitable O
God B-PER
argues O
for O
one O
by O
one O
. O

The O
pattern O
has O
been O
repeated O
hundreds O
of O
times O
, O
by O
now O
. O

Duarte O
: O
So O
Duracell O
takes O
the O
floor O
for O
the O
five O
minutes O
ruled O
out O
, O
and O
then O
she O
pauses O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
goes O
back O
to O
the O
voting O
booth O
for O
another O
three O
minutes O
. O

After O
an O
unbelievable O
amount O
of O
booing O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
classroom O
, O
he O
comes O
back O
. O

seven O
minutes O
of O
God B-PER
and O
three O
minutes O
of O
God B-PER
. O

Very O
few O
interruptions O
. O

to O
give O
him O
a O
hand O
, O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
we O
think O
of O
a O
Catalan B-PER
, O
who O
speaks O
for O
a O
minute O
, O
just O
in O
time O
to O
get O
his O
colleague O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
. O

Welcome O
to O
God B-PER
-- O
show O
: O

the O
writer O
who O
challenged O
everyone O
, O
majority O
and O
opposition O
, O
to O
raise O
the O
bars O
against O
changing O
the O
rules O
. O

It O
's O
only O
with O
the O
help O
of O
a O
pack O
of O
chocolates O
that O
a O
sympathetic O
voter O
gets O
them O
into O
the O
debate O
. O

Scenes O
of O
nervousness O
, O
next O
to O
God B-PER
. O

The O
strangest O
one O
seems O
to O
be O
Marcello B-PER
Carli I-PER
, O
the O
U.D. B-ORG
adviser O
who O
would O
theoretically O
be O
in O
opposition O
just O
like O
the O
writer O
marathoner O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
, O
you O
know O
a O
mile O
away O
where O
you O
want O
to O
hang O
out O
. O

or O
Goddamn B-PER
it O
, O
or O
Bezzi B-PER
sends O
him O
out O
of O
the O
classroom O
, O
appealing O
to O
rule O
72 O
of O
the O
rules O
of O
procedure O
, O
according O
to O
which O
the O
president O
can O
summon O
the O
speaker O
twice O
to O
respect O
the O
subject O
under O
discussion O
: O

after O
the O
two O
yellow O
signs O
, O
you O
can O
do O
the O
exhalation O
. O

So O
, O
everybody O
had O
the O
impression O
that O
Bezzi B-PER

mandate O
was O
this O
: O

hunting O
for O

Some O

take O
it O
seriously O

, O
who O
asks O
for O
a O

written O

live O
to O
say O
that O
they O

reform O

God B-PER

You O

OltraSuoni O
: O

The O
revival O
of O
the O
30th O
- O
century O
bands O
. O

DRO B-LOC
: O
Almost O
3,000 O
people O
in O
three O
days O
to O
teach O
a O
completely O
different O
kind O
of O
music O
. O

This O
is O
the O
budget O
for O
the O
first O
edition O
of O
Oltrasuoni O
, O
the O
soundtrack O
that O
ran O
from O
Friday O
to O
Sunday O
in O
Oltra O
Park O
in O
Dro B-LOC
County I-LOC
. O

So O
basically O
, O
the O
goal O
is O
to O
make O
Oltrasuoni O
a O
little O
thirty O
- O
two O
Woodstock O
, O
or O
rather O
to O
lay O
the O
foundations O
for O
an O
event O
that O
's O
going O
to O
grow O
in O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

" O
Frankly O
, O
we O
did O
n't O
expect O
this O
kind O
of O
response O
-- O
Max B-PER
explained O
to O
us O
from O
the O
Sona B-ORG
Association O
that O
organized O
the O
Oltrasons O
-- O
the O
young O
people O
, O
but O
not O
just O
them O
, O
have O
shown O
that O
they O
want O
to O
date O
the O
music O
teacher O
. O
" O

So O
success O
, O
even O
though O
it O
's O
thought O
that O
Oltra O
Park O
hosted O
a O
concert O
like O
this O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

" O
It O
was O
a O
real O
experiment O
, O
" O
Max B-PER
points O
out O
, O
" O
in O
a O
new O
venue O
that O
accommodated O
a O
lot O
of O
groups O
on O
a O
stage O
that O
was O
just O
right O
for O
the O
situation O
. O
" O

Twenty O
- O
seven O
bands O
-- O
30 O
bands O
, O
but O
not O
just O
that O
-- O
that O
have O
been O
performing O
on O
stage O
since O
Friday O
night O
, O
where O
to O
hit O
the O
mark O
have O
been O
, O
according O
to O
Max B-PER
, O
both O
the O
Geisha B-ORG
and O
the O
Hutchinson B-ORG
with O
a O
live O
abrasive O
that O
confirms O
just O
how O
good O
this O
band O
is O
. O

On O

most O

the O

they O
really O
surprised O
these O

in O

who O
also O
changed O
their O
set O
completely O
from O
the O
past O

The O

over O
a O

danced O

the O

Max B-PER
explains O

the O

at O

" O
Our O
intention O

to O
continue O
with O
Oltrasuoni O
-- O
Matteo B-PER
Cretti I-PER
, O
the O
president O

told O

maybe O
in O
a O

with O
two O

and O
even O
more O

" O

In O

, O
giving O

has O
always O
been O
one O
of O

going O

first O
there O

going O

a O

Today O

the O

the O
consequences O

In O

the O

means O
the O
very O
impressive O
government O

who O
took O
over O
from O

, O
there O
will O

the O
presidents O

assemblies O
of O
the O
five O
special O
- O
status O

. O

For O
the O
Triennial B-LOC
period O
, O
they O
will O
be O
here O
: O

the O
head O
of O
the O
province B-LOC
, O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
, O
the O
president O
of O
the O
provincial B-ORG

The O
House B-ORG
is O
due O
to O
vote O
on O
the O
bill O
next O
Monday O
, O
September O
13 O
. O

The O
Roman O
meeting O
is O
deemed O
important O
, O
because O
it O
will O
be O
an O
opportunity O
to O
demonstrate O
directly O
to O
Calderoli B-PER
Trentino B-LOC
's O
concerns O
about O
constitutional O
reform O
. O

A O
reform O
that O
presents O
a O
number O
of O
problematic O
aspects O
, O
starting O
with O
the O
system O
to O
be O
implemented O
if O
Parliament B-ORG
decides O
to O
amend O
the O
autonomy O
statute O
. O

The O
constitution O
says O
that O
the O
Treaty O
of O
Alto B-LOC
Adige I-LOC
can O
be O
amended O
by O
double O
- O
reading O
by O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
without O
the O
obligation O
to O
involve O
the O
regions O
in O
special O
statutes O
. O

Instead O
, O
Article O
33 O
of O
the O
draft O
constitution O
proposed O
by O
the O
center O
- O
right O
states O
that O
the O
statutes O
can O
be O
amended O
" O
in O
advance O
" O
with O
the O
regions O
concerned O
, O
but O
if O
that O
intention O
is O
not O
met O
within O
six O
months O
of O
the O
submission O
of O
the O
proposals O
, O
Parliament B-ORG
can O
proceed O
with O
the O
amendments O
even O
if O
it O
disagrees O
with O
the O
local O
reality O
. O

From O
Dellai B-PER
and O
Bezzi B-PER
, O
this O
hypothesis O
was O
severely O
challenged O
. O

the O
text O
-- O
it O
was O
said O
-- O
introduces O
" O
a O
series O
of O
serious O
violations O
of O
the O
autonomy O
of O
special O
regions O
and O
autonomous O
provinces O
. O
" O

So O
the O
presidents O
are O
going O
to O
present O
to O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
a O
five O
- O
point O
document O
, O
which O
proposes O
a O
series O
of O
amendments O
to O
the O
legislation O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
drafting O
of O
the O
new O
statutes O
is O
concerned O
, O
a O
strong O
involvement O
of O
the O
regional O
councils O
is O
going O
to O
be O
proposed O
, O
not O
as O
part O
of O
the O
initial O
discussion O
in O
Parliament B-ORG
, O
but O
as O
a O
text O
approved O
in O
second O
reading O
by O
the O
Houses O
. O

For O
presidents O
, O
it O
's O
up O
to O
the O
regional O
assemblies O
to O
give O
the O
final O
say O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
what O
the O
reforms O
are O
now O
anticipating O
. O

Another O
cause O
for O
concern O
is O
the O
prediction O
that O
the O
elections O
for O
the O
re O
- O
election O
of O
all O
the O
regional O
councils O
are O
going O
to O
be O
contested O
with O
the O
federal B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
and O
run O
by O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
. O

This O
, O
according O
to O
the O
presidents O
, O
would O
amount O
to O
" O
a O
tremendous O
leak O
of O
autonomy O
, O
because O
the O
discipline O
of O
the O
election O
of O
councils O
has O
always O
been O
a O
prerogative O
of O
regional O
law O
and O
is O
guaranteed O
by O
the O
statute O
as O
an O
essential O
element O
of O
specificity O
and O
autonomy O
. O
" O

Before O
they O
meet O
the O
presidents O
, O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
is O
going O
to O
meet O
the O
lawyer O
Sergio B-PER
Divina I-PER
. O

The O
two O
of O
them O
have O
a O
long O
- O
established O
friendship O
, O
a O
long O
- O
established O
militia O
on O
the O
road B-ORG
. O

the O
report O
was O
particularly O
frequent O
in O
the O
last O
30 O
election O
campaigns O
. O

The O
same O
Goddess O
is O
going O
to O
present O
a O
series O
of O
requests O
to O
Calderoli B-PER
, O
which O
are O
interestingly O
close O
to O
the O
proposals O
of O
the O
presidents O
of O
the O
regions O
. O

Among O
them O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
always O
anticipate O
a O
favourable O
opinion O
of O
local O
realities O
before O
you O
make O
any O
constitutional O
changes O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
demand O
that O
any O
form O
of O
autonomy O
that O
is O
broader O
than O
it O
is O
today O
be O
extended O
not O
only O
to O
ordinary O
regions O
, O
but O
also O
to O
special O
- O
status O
regions O
. O

God B-PER
does O
n't O
hide O
the O
hope O
of O
bringing O
home O
a O
positive O
outcome O
. O

" O
The O
proposals O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
present O
to O
the O
minister O
-- O
he O
says O
-- O
do O
not O
touch O
on O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
reform O
law O
, O
but O
their O
adoption O
could O
accredit O
the O
League B-ORG
as O
a O
force O
that O
respects O
autonomy O
, O
as O
well O
as O
changing O
the O
political O
orientation O
of O
large O
sections O
of O
the O
population O

This O

the O
commentary O
that O
Vittorio B-PER
Emanuele I-PER
di I-PER
Savoia I-PER
made O
on O
the O
constitutional O
reforms O
under O
the O
parliamentary B-ORG
scrutiny O

As O
far O
as O
the O
economic O
situation O

concerned O
, O
the O
real O
estate O
that O
was O
demolished O
and O
exiled O
-- O
the O
ban O
on O

to O
Italy B-LOC
has O
just O
been O
lifted O
-- O
after O
the O
fall O
of O

, O
looks O
optimistic O

" O
We O
have O
, O
and O
will O
always O
have O
, O
the O
star O
. O
" O

There O
's O
no O
problem O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
be O
okay O
. O

Certainly O
, O
the O
euro O
has O
given O
a O
tremendous O
boost O
to O
wages O
and O
prices O
, O
but O
maybe O
we O
should O
have O
seen O
this O
before O
, O
which O
has O
happened O
everywhere O
anyway O
. O
" O

According O
to O
Vittorio B-PER
Emanuele I-PER
, O
his O
experience O
in O
this O
Italian O
period O
taught O
him O
to O
" O
be O
close O
to O
the O
people O
and O
with O
the O
people O
. O

But O
the O
king O
at O
the O
bottom O
is O
the O
representative O
of O
the O
people O
, O
" O
he O
concluded O
, O
perhaps O
hiding O
a O
single O
claim O
to O
a O
throne O
that O
had O
not O
existed O
for O
sixty O

The O
demands O
for O

autonomy O

CONTEXT O

The O
request O
is O
to O
remove O

of O

By O

the O
46th O

of O
the O

Fascinating O

with O
the O

edition O
in O
1928 O
, O
won O
by O
Major O
Urdareanu B-PER

the O

driving O

Since O
1961 O
, O
until O
last O
year O
, O
the O
competition O
has O
maintained O
its O
global O
relevance O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
in O
the O
' O
90s O
it O
was O
also O
true O
for O
Italians O
. O

The O
audience O
was O
given O
a O
rare O
show O
. O

the O
opportunity O
to O
watch O
the O
evolution O
of O
big O

combined O

going O

stay O

the O
very O
last O

of O
the O
Italian O

championship O
. O

One O
step O
, O
Saturday O
, O
and O
obviously O
a O
shorter O
path O
than O
the O
world O
. O

But O
there O
are O
special O
historians O
, O
like O
San O
Romolo O
, O
Monte O
Ceppo O
and O
Colle O
d O
' O
Oggia O
. O

For O
Renato B-PER
Travaglia I-PER
, O
reducing O
from O
the O
bottle O
to O
the O
Adriatic O
, O
it O
's O
his O
last O
chance O
to O
put O
his O
206 O
Super O
1600 O
on O
the O
podium O
. O

The O
bottom O
, O
asphalt O
, O
would O
be O
ideal O
for O
this O
car O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
race O
car O
racing O
has O
always O
been O
a O
great O
pleasure O
for O
a O
train O
driver O
. O

So O
, O
is O
there O
a O
feeling O
with O
the O
Sanremo O
? O
" O
It O
seems O
. O

In O
1993 O
, O
we O
achieved O
a O
wonderful O
seven O
- O
degree O
absolute O
. O

First O
group O
N O
with O
the O
Ford O
Escort O
Cosworth O
. O

The O
validity O
of O
the O
competition O
was O
global O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
pleasure O
, O
because O
then O
I O
achieved O
my O
first O
miracle O
. O
" O

So O
, O
the O
exodus O
with O
the O
306 O
Maxi O
. O

" O
Yeah O
, O
in O
' O
98 O
we O
got O
tried O
the O
306 O
Maxi O
, O
which O
I O
would O
race O
the O
following O
year O
in O
the O
tricolor O
. O

It O
was O
imperative O
to O
get O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
race O
, O
and O
we O
finished O
third O
in O
the O
2M. O

But O
we O
had O
the O
great O
pleasure O
of O
dropping O
out O
for O
the O
third O
time O
in O
a O
row O
on O
the O
Pantasina O
special O
, O
where O
we O
had O
McRae B-PER
, O
Sainz B-PER
and O
Makinen B-PER
behind O
us O
. O
" O

The O
following O
year O
, O
Travaglia B-PER
dominates O
the O
tricolor O
and O
still O
participates O
in O
the O
Sanremo O
with O
the O
Maxi O
. O

It O
makes O
the O
only O
mistake O
of O
the O
season O
. O

and O
he O
's O
forced O
to O
retreat O
when O
he O
was O
in O

even O
more O

going O

We O
're O
trying O
to O
keep O
getting O
better O

better O

to O
win O
some O
more O

, O
if O
we O
can O
-- O

A O
bronze O
one O
too O

a O

would O
be O
good O

Next O

we O
'll O
have O

, O
we O
'll O

it O

goal O

really O
to O

young O

suffered O
violence O

long O

husband O

brother O

survived O
the O
destruction O

The O
young O
woman O
carries O
with O
her O
all O
the O
weight O
of O
her O
past O
and O
the O
fear O
of O
relating O
to O

But O
the O
common O
and O
absolute O
condition O
of O
pain O
allows O
Jean B-PER
to O
find O
someone O
to O
confess O
all O
of O
his O
desperation O
and O
his O
weakness O
, O
just O
when O
his O
whole O
world O
-- O

him O

was O
forced O
to O
go O

When O
he O
collapses O
, O
however O
, O
the O
wife O
is O
freed O
from O
her O
anguish O

she O
who O
first O
learned O
to O
overcome O
the O
disorientation O
caused O
by O
the O
death O
of O
her O
little O
daughter O
realized O
that O
the O
love O
she O
had O
for O

was O
enough O
to O
keep O
her O
life O

has O
the O
rare O
quality O
of O
dealing O
with O
the O
subject O
matter O
with O
authenticity O
and O
an O
approach O
that O
forces O
the O
viewer O
to O
know O

interpret O
the O
state O

and O
the O
many O
realities O
of O
the O
different O
characters O

Among O

the O
one O
that O

of O
what O

alive O
after O

Today O

assures O

" O
I O

going O
to O
illustrate O
the O
proposal O
in O

" O

Of O
the O
three O
hypotheses O
on O
the O
table O
at O
the O
bottom O
, O
the O
new O
tax O
on O
tourism O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
one O
that O
Mellarini B-PER
prefers O
. O

which O
, O
in O
this O
way O
, O
will O
provide O
the O
resources O
necessary O
to O
fund O
the O
reformed O
Apt B-ORG

The O
additional O
Irap O
-- O
a O
maximum O
of O
one O
percent O
-- O
if O
accepted O
by O
the O
city O
council B-ORG
, O
will O
primarily O
target O
those O
categories O
of O
people O
who O
directly O
benefit O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
tourists O
. O

" O
Then O
we O
're O
going O
to O
evaluate O
-- O
the O
evaluator O
clarifies O
-- O
whether O
to O
do O
this O
with O
other O
subjects O
as O
well O
. O
" O

The O
hypothesis O
that O
's O
going O
to O
follow O
from O
the O
amendment O
to O
Act O
8 O
is O
that O
people O
who O
, O
like O
craftsmen O
, O
make O
greater O
profits O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
unemployed O
will O
also O
be O
taxed O
. O

The O
package O
of O
amendments O
to O
Act O
8 O
also O
includes O
changes O
to O
Pro B-ORG

major O
events O
-- O
for O

, O
the O
Melinda O

where O
the O

will O
go O
from O

are O
the O
Alliance B-ORG
with O
Counsellor O
Denis B-PER
Bertolini I-PER

The O

asks O
that O
, O
" O
before O
we O
think O
about O
new O

, O
" O
the O
committee B-ORG

us O
how O
the O
enormous O
public O

available O

been O
spent O
over O
these O
years O
. O
" O

Bertolini B-PER
calls O
taxation O
" O
unimaginable O
, O
" O
because O
" O
to O

means O
to O

We O

that O

at O

, O
he O

does O

was O

by O

during O
a O
meeting O

at O

aimed O
at O

" O
Today O

certainly O
a O
good O
step O
forward O

" O
says O
Stefano B-PER
Montani I-PER
of O
Cgil B-ORG
. O
" O
The O
company O
has O
secured O
its O
own O
availability O
for O
the O
integration O
fund O
and O
is O
ready O
to O
anticipate O
some O
of O
the O
TFR O
for O
the O

to O
reduce O
the O
economic O

" O

The O
confirmation O
of O
closing O
at O
the O
end O
of O
February O
, O
also O
-- O
adds O
Montani B-PER
-- O
is O
certainly O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
two O
months O
ahead O
of O
schedule O
. O
" O

The O
plan O
that O
's O
being O
put O
in O
place O
to O
get O
the O
extraordinary O
integration O
fund O
concession O
, O
which O
involves O
identifying O
a O
replacement O
business O
, O
should O
involve O
more O
than O
one O
company O
. O

According O
to O
a O
first O
- O
hand O
job O
hypothesis O
, O
all O
to O
be O
verified O
, O
a O
dozen O
employees O
could O
be O
absorbed O
by O
Unifarm B-ORG
, O
which O
, O
being O
the O
only O
one O
to O
do O
so O
officially O
, O
has O
already O
shown O
its O
interest O
. O

Some O
more O
, O
between O
20 O
and O
30 O
, O
should O
be O
transferred O
to O
a O
second O
company O
, O
with O
which O
we O
're O
still O
negotiating O
, O
but O
not O
from O
Lesaffre B-ORG
Italy I-ORG
, O
but O
directly O
from O
the O
province B-LOC
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
hypothesis O
, O
there O
's O
also O
the O
name O
of O
Cavit B-ORG
, O
although O
officially O
no O
one O
has O
come O
forward O
. O

" O
We O
're O
evaluating O
the O
feasibility O
of O
this O
option O
, O
but O
without O
commitment O
to O
the O
staff O
, O
" O
they O
say O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
consortium B-ORG
. O

Some O
of O
the O
paintings O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
will O
be O
moved O
to O
the O
plant O
in O
Parma B-LOC
, O
while O
22 O
positions O
will O
be O
filled O
through O

. O

With O
these O
numbers O
, O
on O
his O
part O
, O
Industry O
Advisor O
Marco B-PER
Benedetti I-PER
says O
, O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
big O
problems O
with O
the O
cash O
register O
. O
" O

The O
political O
commitment O
on O
Dante B-LOC
Square I-LOC
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
seen O
by O
Lesaffre B-ORG
as O
a O
prerequisite O
for O
going O
down O
that O

While O
negotiations O
were O
going O
on O
in O
the O
upper O

was O
a O

as O
evidenced O
by O

The O

proves O
that O
it O

no O
capacity O

instead O
of O
blaming O
the O

it O
should O
try O

understand O
that O

" O

Catalan B-PER

called O
the O

There O
were O
also O
two O
community B-LOC
technicians O
and O
the O
district B-LOC
president O
, O
Alessandro B-PER
Depedri I-PER
. O

The O
meeting O
revealed O
the O
firm O
will O
of O
the O
technicians O
and O
of O
Depedri B-PER
to O
ensure O
first O
and O
foremost O
safety O

to O
facilitate O

the O

" O
Rudari B-PER
, O
" O
said O
Ms. O
Degasperi B-PER
, O
" O
has O
shown O
himself O
to O
be O
very O
understanding O
and O
willing O
to O
find O
a O
solution O
that O
meets O
our O
expectations O
. O

The O
technicians O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
argued O
that O
the O
idea O
of O
grace O
was O
also O
supported O
by O
the O
mountain O
basins O
, O
who O
opposed O
the O
possibility O
of O
touching O
the O
beetle O
of O
the O
rock O
to O
create O
a O
sort O
of O

. O
" O

But O
what O
did O

sit O
well O
was O
the O
unwavering O
will O
of O
the O
mayor O
of O
the O
riding B-LOC
to O
cover O
the O

with O
a O
thank O
you O
, O
not O
to O
show O
that O
he O
was O
willing O
to O
find O
other O
solutions O
. O

" O
We O
are O
convinced O
-- O
Alessandra B-PER
Degasperi I-PER
said O
-- O
that O
the O
worst O
closure O
is O
actually O
in O
the O
district B-ORG
council I-ORG
of O
Sardagna B-LOC
. O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
district B-LOC
itself O
needs O
to O
carefully O
consider O
a O
serious O
rethink O
and O
look O
for O
new O
, O
more O
satisfying O
solutions O
, O
because O
the O
street O
is O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
many O
people O
's O
lives O
. O

So O
we O
're O
going O
to O
ask O
the O
three O
councillors O
who O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
speak O
to O
us O
in O
the O
public O
assembly O
-- O
B. B-PER
Berloffa I-PER
, O
G. B-PER
Zambelli I-PER
and O
R. B-PER
Degasperi I-PER
-- O
to O
ask O
the O
president O
to O
put O
the O
matter O
on O
the O
agenda O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
the O
district O
council O
. O
" O

To O
complete O
the O
picture O
, O
the O
promoters O
also O
spoke O
directly O
to O
the O
engineer O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
mountain O
basins O
who O
confirmed O
their O
willingness O
to O
find O
new O
solutions O

Dellai B-PER

this O

Fourth O

without O

. O

He O
did O
n't O
choose O
a O
happy O
moment O
to O
make O
such O
a O
tough O
choice O
. O

But O
you O
know O
, O
when O
you O
're O
convinced O
that O
the O
time O
is O
right O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
push O

back O

A O
similar O

could O

. O

Well O
, O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
today O
is O
facing O
his O
fourth O
day O
of O
nicotine O
withdrawal O
. O

Being O
the O
president O
of O
the O
province B-LOC
, O
even O
a O
completely O
personal O
choice O
becomes O
news O
. O

If O
you O
're O
used O
to O
seeing O
a O
governor O
with O
an O
inseparable O
pack O
of O
cigarettes O
-- O
a O
lifelong O
companion O
, O
basically O
-- O
you O
might O
find O
a O
completely O
different O
president O
. O

in O
a O
slightly O
healthier O
version O
. O

On O
the O
motivations O
for O
yesterday O
's O
choice O
, O
Dellai B-PER
himself O
was O
a O
little O
furious O
. O

" O
I O
just O
realized O
I O
smoked O
too O
much O
. O
" O

Is O
it O
possible O
to O
meet O
with O
voters O
, O
to O
attend O
long O
meetings O
, O
to O
write O
the O
budget O
of O
a O
parliament O
without O
even O
using O
a O
bion O
? O

So O
far O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
so O
. O

For O
four O
days O
, O
the O
president O
refused O
. O

Of O

the O
effects O
, O
you O
can O
see O

there O
they O
are O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
in O
the O
face O

the O

He O

He O
worked O

has O
30 O

collapsed O
in O
the O

crisis O
that O
is O
plaguing O
the O
Italian O
political O

? O

Trentino B-LOC
was O
not O
absent O
from O

is O
shattered O
. O

Italia I-ORG

. O

The O
Socialists O
basically O
disappeared O
-- O

And O
here O
's O
the O
autonomous O
stream O
that O
's O
part O
of O
the O
local O
political O
genome O
. O

But O
I O
think O
the O
local O
governments O
in O
the O
center O
- O
right O
here O
have O
more O
institutional O
control O
. O

Greater O
control O
of O
the O
administrative O
machine O
. O

Maybe O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
you O
can O
talk O
about O
a O
greater O
upholding O
of O
the O
30th O
community O
, O
which O
has O
a O
greater O
degree O
of O
solidarity O
and O
a O
greater O
degree O
of O
average O
rigour O
in O
relation O
to O
institutions O
. O

Here O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
's O
better O
than O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
. O

If O
the O
political O
structure O
somehow O
rules O
, O
can O
it O
maintain O
the O
social O
state O
, O
the O
overall O
level O
of O
services O
, O
given O
the O
attacks O
on O
30 O
percent O
autonomy O
coming O
from O
Rome B-LOC
and O
its O
" O
dismal O
" O
wealth O
in O
terms O
of O
financial O
resources O
? O

The O
overall O
assumption O
of O
the O
local O
welfare O
system O
, O
which O
includes O
all O
kinds O
of O
transfers O
-- O
unemployment O
, O
poverty O
, O
disability O
, O
health O
, O
education O
and O
schooling O
-- O
beyond O
a O
series O
of O
necessary O
adjustments O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
, O
still O
works O
well O
. O

There O
's O
a O
picture O
of O
physical O
aid O
coming O
to O
the O
citizen O
. O

And O
yet O
, O
the O
Istat B-ORG
statistics O
have O
talked O
about O
new O
poverty O
in O
Trinidad O
and O
Tobago B-LOC
. O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
that O
it O
seemed O
like O
Trentino B-LOC
was O
increasing O
poverty O
-- O
which O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
-- O
was O
because O
consumption O
was O
low O
. O

But O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
privileged O
tariff O
system O
, O
because O
of O
the O
intervention O
of O
the O
public O
administration O
. O

The O
train O
drivers O
spend O
very O
little O
on O
transportation O
, O
schooling O
and O
health O
care O
. O

The O
welfare O
system O
covers O
a O
range O
of O
services O
that O
are O
paid O
elsewhere O
by O
citizens O
. O

You O
think O
about O
textbook O
storage O
in O
compulsory O
schools O
, O
big O
savings O
for O
families O
-- O

Yeah O
, O
public O
tariffs O
. O

Half O
a O
revolution O
for O
the O
proposal O
to O
bring O
the O
bus O
ticket O
to O
Trento B-LOC
to O
one O
euro O
. O

( O
Laughter O
) O

The O
millennium O
subway O
ticket O
costs O
more O
than O
a O
euro O
and O
is O
cheaper O
in O
less O
time O
. O

Here O
the O
provincial O
government O
uses O
a O
public O
budget O
that O
is O
one O
of O
the O
highest O
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O

The O
Lombardy B-LOC
Region I-LOC
and O
the O
commune B-LOC
of I-LOC
Milan I-LOC
are O
not O
poor O
entities O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
here O
the O
public O
contribution O
per O
capita O
is O
still O
higher O
. O

So O
the O
question O
is O
: O

is O
the O
public O
debt O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
adequately O
invested O
? O

And O
my O
feeling O
is O
that O
there O
's O
a O
tremendous O
level O
of O
legitimacy O
out O
there O
from O
the O
local O
government O
that O
's O
been O
demonstrating O
that O
it O
's O
managing O
in O
an O
unfiltered O
way O
. O

It O
's O
perfect O
. O

In O
this O
, O
Trentino B-LOC
should O
be O
referring O
to O
Central O
and O
Northern O
Europe O
and O
not O
constantly O
comparing O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O

Professor O
Schizzerotto B-PER
, O
when O
the O
provincial O
structure O
begins O
to O
define O
the O
new O
annual O
budget O
, O
dozens O
of O
departments O
begin O
to O
spend O
money O
, O
even O
in O
small O
amounts O
, O
for O
the O
sole O
reason O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
see O
themselves O
cutting O
funds O
for O
the O
next O
year O
... O

I O
'm O
saying O
that O
in O
the O
Italian O
context O
, O
the O
whole O
system O
has O
strong O
points O
of O
legitimacy O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
compelling O
examples O
of O
public O
- O
harm O
waste O
. O

There O
are O
strong O
signs O
of O
ocular O
use O
of O
public O
harm O
. O

So O
autonomy O
is O
legitimate O
. O

Why O
take O
it O
out O
in O
the O
Trentino B-LOC
? O

Rather O
, O
what O
we O
see O
is O
that O
nationally O
, O
similar O
levels O
of O
autonomy O
are O
emerging O
. O

But O
that O
does O
n't O
mean O
that O
citizens O
should O
expect O
everything O
for O
free O
. O

In O
a O
situation O
of O
low O
economic O
development O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
public O
administration O
can O
not O
continue O
to O
meet O
every O
single O
citizen O
's O
needs O
. O

There O
's O
a O
need O
to O
demand O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
burden O
of O
proof O
, O
coupled O
with O
the O
economic O
capacity O
of O
families O
. O

The O
zero O
- O
dollar O
to O
one O
- O
euro O
bus O
ticket O
created O
apprenticeships O
and O
protests O
. O

Exciting O
. O

It O
's O
reasonable O
to O
try O
and O
raise O
tariffs O
. O

It O
's O
better O
for O
the O
private O
sector O
to O
pay O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
public O
sector O
to O
go O
into O
crisis O
. O

The O
average O
30 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
has O
to O
realize O
that O
we O
're O
living O
in O
a O

And O
at O

slightly O

the O

He O
says O
that O
that O

should O
n't O
have O
alarmed O

" O
The O
teacher O
rightly O
used O

They O

words O
that O
are O
found O
in O
every O

" O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
the O
tensions O
between O
the O
teacher O
and O
some O
of O
the O
families O
are O
very O
old O
. O

According O
to O
Baldo B-PER
, O
sometimes O
the O
teacher O
was O
not O
appreciated O
because O
she O
was O
" O
direct O
. O
" O

" O

the O
working O
method O

" O
is O

is O
very O
lively O

she O
keeps O
it O

" O

And O
then O
there O
's O
the O
criticism O
of O
the O

saying O

" O
You O
have O

came O
to O
Rome B-LOC

ask O
for O
institutional O

, O
despite O
refuting O
his O
own O
personal O
conviction O
in O

opposed O
the O
overwhelming O

" O
There O

The O

due O
to O
come O
into O
class O
September O
16th O
through O
October O
8th O
. O

" O
It O
is O
paradoxical O
that O
a O
constitutional O
reform O
born O
of O
federalism O
risks O
reducing O
the O
autonomy O
that O
is O
already O
guaranteed O
to O
special O

status O
regions O

provinces O

" O
commented O
President O
Dellai B-PER
, O
who O
has O
just O
come O
out O
of O
the O
top O
with O
Calderoli B-PER
. O

" O
This O
bill O
fundamentally O
changes O
the O
constitutional O
foundations O
of O
our O
orders O

We O
ca O

just O
stand O
there O

" O

The O
comments O
made O
by O
Presidents O
Magnani B-PER

Bezzi B-PER
are O
also O
troubling O

" O
The O
meeting O
went O
wrong O
, O
" O
said O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
board B-ORG
. O

And O
Magnani B-PER
added O
, O

" O
They O
want O
to O
bring O
home O
the O
federalism O
law O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
interest O
in O
the O
Trentino B-LOC

" O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
was O
reassured O
of O
was O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
best O
- O
in O
- O
class O
" O
clause O
. O

The O
novelty O
of O
federalism O
reform O
will O
only O
apply O
to O
special O
autonomy O
if O
it O
improves O
on O
what O
it O
already O
has O
. O

Not O
that O
long O
ago O
, O
however O
, O
Calderoli B-PER
reversed O
that O
and O
said O
, O
" O
However O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
national O
interest O
, O
which O
also O
applies O
to O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
remains O
in O
force O
. O
" O

This O
means O
that O
the O
federal B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
could O
repeal O
autonomy O
laws O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
national O
interest O
, O
which O
is O
quite O
a O
broad O
concept O
. O

" O
The O
Senate B-ORG
is O
a O
political O
body O
, O
" O
Dellai B-PER
said O
straight O
away O
. O

" O
This O
means O
that O
our O
laws O
will O
be O
judged O
by O
a O
political O
body O
. O
" O

The O
minister O
is O
in O
agreement O
, O
the O
governor O
is O
not O
-- O
the O
minister O
has O
repeatedly O
said O
that O
, O
if O
it O
were O
for O
him O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
national O
interest O
would O
not O
even O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
. O

" O
But O
the O
majority O
agreement O
foresees O
that O
, O

Paolo B-PER
Monti I-PER
, O
at O

long O
talk O
, O
was O
very O
clear O
: O

" O
I O
'm O
convinced O
that O
the O
way O
out O
might O
be O
to O
add O
to O
the O
mastodontic O
hysteresis O

some O
days O

where O
we O
take O

" O

Patt B-ORG
's O
adviser O
explained O
that O
he O
's O
particularly O
interested O
in O
the O
momentum O
of O
the O
productive O
world O
, O
of O
those O
craftsmen O
who O
have O
asked O
for O
areas O
of O
expansion O
. O

This O
is O
a O
subject O
that O
the O
architect O
Andreatta B-PER
would O
have O
liked O
to O
bring O
back O
to O
the O
next O
urban O
master O
plan O
, O
but O
at O
this O
point O
he O
might O
also O
want O
to O
consider O
. O

What O
's O
certain O
is O
that O
an O
exit O
must O
be O
found O
, O
worth O
the O
trouble O
of O
the O
proposition O
. O

Somebody O
took O
the O
trouble O
to O
calculate O
how O
many O
seats O
it O
would O
take O
to O
look O
at O
all O
the O
amendments O
that O
were O
tabled O
. O

That O
's O
the O
beauty O
of O
62 O
, O
more O
or O
less O
what O
the O
city B-ORG
council I-ORG
does O
in O
a O
year O
. O

Compensable O
. O

For O
the O
time O
being O
, O
the O
advice B-ORG
has O
been O
extended O
to O
Wednesday O
next O
. O

With O
Raoul B-PER
Pontalti I-PER
, O
too O
, O
there O
's O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
possible O
leap O
. O

What O
the O
National B-ORG
Alliance I-ORG
's O
chief O
of O
staff O
is O
most O
interested O
in O
is O
identifying O
an O
appropriate O
area O
for O
the O
municipal O
canopy O
, O
which O
will O
have O
to O
weave O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
Sembenotti O
masonry O
, O
which O
will O
be O
laid O
out O
on O
the O
ground O
to O
make O
room O
for O
a O
new O
canopy O
along O
the O
periphery O
. O

This O
alternative O
has O
n't O
hinted O
at O
any O
alternative O
yet O
. O

Andreatta B-PER
recently O
stated O
that O
she O
was O
inclined O
to O
realign O
the O
former O
farm O
company O
of O
Camparta B-LOC
, O
which O
had O
been O
thrown O
out O
because O
it O
was O
too O
decentralized O
. O

Pontalti B-PER
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
insists O
on O
a O
bottom O
- O
up O
solution O
. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
whether O
there O
are O
any O
contract O
margins O
with O
the O
writer O
Giuseppe B-PER
Filippin I-PER
. O

Yesterday O
, O
the O
judge O
was O
looking O
for O
more O
cameras O
to O
make O
contact O
. O

Useless O
. O

In O
hiding O
from O
his O
guard O
during O
the O
counseling O
session O
, O
he O
even O
sent O
him O
a O
text O
message O
, O
proposing O
a O
date O
for O
this O
afternoon O
. O

But O
Philippines B-PER
, O
for O
the O
time O
being O
, O
seems O
to O
be O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
being O
tough O
. O

" O
We O
're O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
not O
returning O
, O
" O
he O
says O
, O
" O
and O
if O
I O
have O
to O
lose O
my O
face O
, O
I O
'd O
rather O
do O
it O
in O
class O
. O
" O

So O
the O
discussion O
went O
on O
without O
much O
fanfare O
, O
but O
with O
some O
surprise O
. O

Leo B-PER
Vilardi I-PER
, O
for O
example O
, O
despite O
appealing O
to O
a O
majority O
- O
voting O
coalition O
discipline O
, O
wanted O
to O
keep O
the O
center O
- O
left O
in O

postponing O
the O
decision O
on O
the O
Social B-ORG
Confront I-ORG
vote O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
debate O
. O

His O
main O
fear O
is O
that O
, O
through O
the O
observations O
and O
the O
amendments O
, O
the O
variant O
risks O
turning O
into O
something O
that O
leads O
to O
conclusions O
that O
are O
different O
from O
what O
is O
expected O
. O

Autonomous O
architect O
Alberto B-PER
Pattini I-PER
has O
praised O
the O
climate O
and O
the O
spirit O
with O
which O
the O
city O

has O
been O
working O
these O
months O
on O
the O

and O

undertaken O
the O
excellent O
work O

by O

to O
maintain O
a O
series O
of O
historic O
buildings O
from O
the O
early O

that O
are O
architecturally O
significant O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
insisting O
that O
a O
different O
solution O
be O
found O
for O
Steiner O
's O
school O
, O
the O
green O
Aldo B-PER
Pompermaier I-PER
went O
into O
the O
soft O

. O

The O
one O
in O
the O
Vela B-LOC
does O
n't O
fully O
convince O
him O
and O
waits O
for O
the O
specific O

, O
but O
remembers O
for O
the O
occasions O
lost O
in O
the O
past O
. O

" O
There O
will O

and O
there O
was O
every O

" O

Finally O
, O
Sergio B-PER
Cappelletti I-PER
, O
on O

of O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
highlighted O
some O
technical O

, O

everything O

The O
points O

the O

" O

we O

up O

us O
to O

, O
" O
Mauro B-PER
Betta I-PER
told O
the O
Margherita B-ORG

tonight O
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
in O
the O
ruling O
party O
believes O
that O
yesterday O
is O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
process O
that O
will O
lead O

with O
the O
first O
points O

The O

when O
he O
asked O
for O
the O
program O

" O

, O
" O
a O
word O
that O
was O
kept O
secret O
from O
Dellai B-PER
. O

" O
It O
's O
not O
a O
question O
of O
terms O
, O
" O
the O
secretary O
of O
Quercia B-ORG
explained O
. O
" O
What O
matters O
is O
that O
you O
decide O
to O
discuss O
the O

" O

Three O
questions O

might O
see O

out O

: O

the O

It O
's O
clear O
that O
these O
issues O
are O
not O
mutually O
exclusive O
. O

So O
he O
takes O
the O
word O
Marco B-PER
Boato I-PER
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
recent O
municipal O
elections O
, O
which O
led O
to O
the O

of O

was O
immediately O
accepted O
by O
Dellai B-PER

the O
other O
participants O
in O
the O
meeting O
. O

So O
Boato B-PER
asked O
the O
president O
-- O
" O
In O
accordance O
with O
the O
prerogatives O
that O
electoral O
law O
gives O
to O
the O

" O
-- O
to O
think O
about O
a O

of O

. O

I O
mean O
, O
a O
cut O
, O
for O
a O
possible O
reinstatement O
of O
the O
mandate O
of O
the O

. O

He O
also O
endorsed O
the O
same O
parliamentary O
proposal O
to O
hold O
a O
meeting O
-- O
a O
workshop O
on O
the O
development O

of O

which O
will O
take O

in O

Autonomous O

Sergio B-PER

on O
the O
importance O
of O

then O

" O
I O
'm O
delighted O
that O
we O

able O
to O
find O

My O
impression O
is O
that O
Rome B-LOC
wants O
to O
bring O
this O
reform O
home O
at O
all O
costs O
, O
beyond O
what O
it O
can O

the O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
the O
Trentino B-LOC
does O
n't O
matter O
that O
much O
anymore O
. O

And O
this O
is O
in O
a O
delicate O
phase O
of O
our O
autonomy O

where O
you O

at O

of O
a O
Polish O
citizen O
going O

the O

It O

invested O

tangible O
. O

He O
was O
crossing O
by O
Piedicastello B-LOC
. O

A O
Polish O
citizen O
was O
shot O
yesterday O
night O
at O
around O
21 O
when O
he O
was O
crossing O
the O
street O
in O
a O
tangential O
, O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
Bonomelli O
Opera O
House O
. O

The O
man O
was O
picked O
up O
by O
an O
ambulance O
at O
118 B-ORG
and O
taken O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

His O
condition O
immediately O
became O
very O
serious O
. O

In O
the O
wound O
, O
he O
had O
a O
cranial O
injury O
and O
other O
injuries O
. O

Doctors O
have O
reserved O
the O
prognosis O
, O
even O
though O
they O
think O
the O
man O
is O
not O
in O
danger O
of O
life O
. O

The O
man O
was O
crossing O
the O
fence O
on O
foot O
, O
probably O
to O
go O
to O
the O
nearby O
Bonomelli O
Opera O
House O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
see O
a O
car O
coming O
in O
from O
the O
north O
. O

The O
scream O
was O
impossible O
to O
avoid O
. O

At O
the O
wheel O
of O
the O
car O
was O
a O
woman O
who O
could O
only O
see O
the O
man O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
. O

Every O
attempt O
to O
stop O
was O
futile O
. O

The O
car O
slammed O
into O
the O
Pole O
and O
blew O
him O
away O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
the O
car O
had O
slowed O
down O
a O
lot O
before O
the O
scream O
, O
otherwise O
the O
consequences O
would O
have O
been O
much O
more O
severe O
. O

The O
woman O
told O
the O
urban O
cops O
she O
had O
n't O
seen O
the O
man O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O
until O
the O
very O
last O
moment O
. O

So O
the O
car O
was O
centered O
on O
the O
poor O
guy O
. O

The O
urban O
police O
immediately O
came O
in O
and O
they O
also O
tried O
to O
do O
roadworthiness O
tests O
. O

The O
injured O
man O
was O
rushed O
to O
an O
ambulance O
that O
took O
him O
immediately O
to O
the O
Santa O
Chiara O
Hospital O
. O

The O
man O
was O
treated O
by O
emergency B-ORG
room O
doctors O
who O
saw O
multiple O
injuries O
. O

The O
man O
was O
still O
conscious O
. O

That O
's O
why O
doctors O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
life O
- O
threatening O
. O

However O
, O
his O
condition O
does O
n't O
allow O
for O
the O
meltdown O
of O
the O
prediction O
. O

Calderoli B-PER
assures O
you O
: O

" O
The O
amendment O
that O
equates O
you O
with O
other O
regions O
will O
be O
repealed O
. O
" O

" O
Let O
's O
not O
touch O
your O
powers O
. O
" O

" O
Nobody O
wants O
to O
call O
into O
question O
the O
autonomy O
of O
special O
- O
status O
regions O
and O
autonomous O
provinces O
. O

So O
the O
federalist O
reform O
amendment O
that O
could O
somehow O
equate O
these O
to O
ordinary O
regions O
will O
be O
abolished O
. O
" O

That O
's O
what O
the O
Minister O
for O
Reform O
, O
Roberto B-PER
Calderoli I-PER
, O
assured O
us O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meeting O
with O
Dellai B-PER
and O
Durnwalder B-PER
. O

" O
We O
clarified O
our O
ideas O
, O
" O
the O
minister O
said O
. O

The O
government O
has O
shown O
its O
willingness O
not O
to O
touch O
on O
regional O
and O
provincial O
autonomy O
. O

Amendments O
were O
tabled O
in O
the O
House B-ORG
that O
would O
take O
some O
risks O
on O
this O
point O
. O

For O
most O
of O
the O
questions O
on O
the O
carpet O
, O
I O
would O
say O
, O
you O
can O
just O
about O
find O
the O
solution O
. O

There O
's O
still O
some O
work O
to O
do O
on O
two O
or O
three O
points O
. O

But O
I O
think O
the O
amendment O
that O
tends O
to O
equate O
special O
- O
status O
regions O
with O
regular O
- O
status O
regions O
is O
going O
to O
be O
completely O
repealed O
. O
" O

" O
In O
fact O
, O
nobody O
-- O
added O
Calderoli B-PER
-- O
wanted O
to O
touch O
the O
special O
character O
of O
the O
Regions O
. O

To O
determine O
a O
series O
of O
steps O
that O
were O
necessary O
to O
get O
into O
the O
new O
system O
, O
you O
went O
a O
little O
bit O
further O
, O
you O
interfered O
with O
their O
specificities O
that O
nobody O
wanted O
to O
touch O
. O
" O

" O
So O
, O
" O
Calderoli B-PER
concluded O
, O
" O
the O
transitional O
rule O
of O
the O
text O
will O
be O
revised O
so O
that O
, O
until O
the O
new O
statutes O
are O
in O
place O
, O
the O
provisions O
could O
also O
apply O
to O
the O
special O
status O
regions O
, O
respecting O
their O
autonomy O
. O
" O

the O

were O
in O

him O

reported O
being O
stuck O
in O
a O

after O
the O

parked O

The O
man O
would O
then O
touch O
the O
poor O
woman O

hand O
and O
masturbate O
. O

The O
interrogator O
said O
that O
he O
was O
confined O
to O
accompanying O
the O
young O
woman O
home O
after O
a O
night O
in O
a O
discotheque O
. O

The O
episode O
aired O
on O
March O
28 O
, O
2004 O
. O

That O
night O
, O
the O
two O
of O
them O
, O
who O
already O
knew O
each O
other O
because O
she O
was O
the O
girlfriend O
of O
a O
Tunisian O
friend O
, O
were O
in O
a O
discotheque O
. O

Late O
at O
night O
, O
the O
man O
offered O
to O
bring O
the O
girl O
home O
. O

She O
had O
accepted O
without O
question O
the O
real O
intentions O
of O
what O
she O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
friend O
. O

After O
the O
violence O
, O
she O
spent O
weeks O
reflecting O
on O
what O
had O
happened O
, O
undecided O
what O
to O
do O
. O

The O
right O
decision O
, O
which O
was O
to O
file O
a O
complaint O
with O
the O
RCMP B-ORG
, O
came O
only O
after O
20 O
days O
. O

Over O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
investigations O
by O
the O
RCMP O
that O
were O
able O
to O
find O
organic O
traces O
of O
the O
Y10 O
were O
disappointing O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
defendant O
argued O
that O
she O
had O
never O
defied O
the O
woman O
. O

P.M. O
Paolo B-PER
Storari I-PER
ordered O
the O
DNA O
test O
on O
the O
spot O
that O
the O
truckers O
found O
on O
the O
seats O
of O
their O
cars O
. O

to O
the O
Hungarian O
legal O
doctor O
Anna B-PER
Caenazzo I-PER
. O

The O
doctor O
cut O
a O
piece O
of O
tissue O
out O
of O
the O
seat O
. O

The O
subsequent O
reviews O
had O
a O
severe O
impact O
on O
the O
credibility O
of O
the O
tuna O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
spot O
was O
a O
seminal O
fluid O
, O
perfectly O
compatible O
with O
Ahmed B-PER
Mahalouthi I-PER

DNA O

And O
so O
yesterday O
, O
they O
were O
sentenced O
to O
two O
years O
and O
eight O
months O
in O
prison O
with O
expulsion O
orders O
. O

So O
heavy O
hand O

perhaps O
also O
because O

not O
show O
the O

sign O

regret O

And O
most O

, O
he O
does O

" O
I O

" O

But O
one O
thing O
Lotti B-PER
is O
sure O
of O
. O

" O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
in O
this O
Russia B-LOC
, O
in O
Putin B-PER
's O
Russia O
, O
you O
did O
n't O
move O
without O
a O
presidential O
order O
. O
" O

The O
negotiation O
, O
the O
negotiation O
, O
they O
should O
have O
continued O
. O

But O
is O
n't O
there O
a O
risk O
of O
legitimizing O
the O
demands O
of O
any O
extremist O
group O
? O

The O
no O
to O
terrorism O
must O
be O
clear O
, O
unambiguous O
and O
unequivocal O
. O

But O
you O
also O
have O
to O
understand O
that O
there O
is O
n't O
just O
one O
. O

there O
are O
different O
ones O
. O

It O
's O
about O
understanding O
what O
kind O
of O
response O
to O
give O
to O
each O
person O
based O
on O
the O
regions O
where O
they O
're O
born O
. O

Terrorism O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
is O
a O
degenerative O
phenomenon O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
terrorism O
is O
that O
? O

Its O
roots O
lie O
in O
the O
failure O
to O
meet O
the O
demands O
for O
greater O
autonomy O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the O
Soviet B-LOC
Union I-LOC
. O

It O
emerges O
, O
like O
everybody O
else O
, O
from O
an O
unsolved O
problem O
: O

you O
have O
to O
figure O
out O
which O
one O
. O

That O
is O
why O
it O
is O
necessary O
that O
the O
Russian O
regime O
-- O
unfortunately O
, O
I O
am O
forced O
to O
call O
it O
that O
because O
of O
the O
violations O
and O
the O
serious O
crimes O
that O
it O
has O
perpetrated O
-- O
put O
the O
negotiation O
back O
at O
the O
center O
of O
the O
debate O
as O
the O
Chechen O
people O
demand O
it O
. O

Terrorism O
is O
born O
out O
of O
complete O
despair O
, O
and O
Putin B-PER
's O
rejection O
of O
dialogue O
with O
the O
political O
component O
has O
reinforced O
extremist O
friction O
. O

But O
there O
's O
also O
talk O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
Arabs O
and O
links O
to O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
-- O

I O
think O
there O
's O
a O
simplification O
in O
the O
rhetoric O
of O
communication O
. O

we O
expect O
there O
to O
be O
convictions O
of O
Arabs O
. O

And O
then O
it O
's O
not O
said O
that O
this O
means O
that O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
is O
involved O
. O

Repeat O
. O

there O
are O
different O
types O
of O
terrorism O
with O
different O
purposes O
. O

For O
example O
, O
he O
attacked O
Iraq B-LOC
because O
of O
Bin B-PER
Laden I-PER
, O
but O
Saddam B-PER
had O
opposing O
interests O
to O
those O
of O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
. O

At O
thousands O
of O
miles O
away O
, O
what O
can O
sensitive O
citizens O
do O
to O
spur O
new O
approaches O
? O

Contradictions O
like O
Beslan B-LOC
's O
, O
but O
not O
just O
Beslan O
's O
, O
can O
never O
be O
justified O
. O

With O
that O
in O
mind O
, O
there O
has O
to O
be O
a O
collective O
commitment O
to O
putting O
the O
rights O
, O
the O
values O
and O
the O
dignity O
of O
every O
human O
being O
at O
the O
center O
of O
attention O
. O

Even O
because O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
everybody O
who O
does O
n't O
go O
in O
there O
always O
dies O
-- O

The O
fact O
is O
, O
there O
's O
always O
somebody O
who O
is O
willing O
to O
fund O
the O
mess O
, O
and O
from O
every O
conflict O
, O
he O
tries O
to O
benefit O
. O

in O
Chechnya B-LOC
as O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
or O
in O
the O
Great B-LOC
Lakes I-LOC
region O
of O
Africa O
. O

So O
specifically O
, O
what O
do O
you O
do O
? O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
're O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
jungle O
law O
and O
not O
international O
law O
prevail O
. O

That O
's O
why O
the O
Chechen O
question O
is O
brought O
into O
the O
only O
common O
home O
that O
humanity O
has O
, O
the O
U.N. B-ORG

The O
united B-ORG
nations I-ORG
, O
despite O
all O
their O
flaws O
, O
are O
not O
to O
be O
dismissed O
. O

The O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
must O
impose O
a O
mandate O
to O
induce O
the O
Russian O
government O
to O
open O
up O
dialogue O
with O
the O
civilian O
authorities O
in O
Chechnya B-LOC
and O
not O
with O
the O
current O
ghost O

buster O
government O
. O

Iraq B-LOC
? O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
does O
n't O
want O
to O
give O
up O
, O
but O
the O
reasoning O
is O
the O
same O
. O

Prevention O
would O
be O
better O
than O
cure O
. O

We O
should O
n't O
always O
be O
responding O
to O
all O
kinds O
of O
gun O
calls O
, O
but O
we O
should O
be O
responding O
to O
all O
kinds O
of O
violence O
. O

The O
European B-LOC

asked O
for O
" O

" O
on O
the O

-- O

The O
U.S. O
foreign B-ORG
ministry I-ORG
, O
in O
my O
view O
, O
has O
n't O
spoken O
on O
a O
personal O
level O
. O

But O
if O
Europe B-LOC
retreated O
on O
this O

, O
it O
would O
mean O
that O
it O

not O

He O
can O

the O

he O

I O

not O

it O
's O
a O

It O
's O
also O

the O
way O

TRENTO B-LOC
: O
An O
exciting O
challenge O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
to O
rediscover O
a O
passion O
that O
had O
become O
less O
intense O
over O
the O
years O
. O

The O
challenge O
is O
to O
grow O
a O
movement O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
as O
well O
that O
was O
completely O
overlooked O
until O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
, O
which O
is O
women O
's O
cycling O
. O

It O
was O
picked O
up O
by O
Diego B-PER
Trepin I-PER
, O
who O
after O
a O
very O
good O
career O
as O
an O
amateur O
and O
a O
professional O
-- O
in O
the O
early O
' O
90s O
-- O
in O
Dino B-PER
Zandeguo I-PER
's O
Moving O
Zg O
and O
Lampre B-ORG
-- O
for O
almost O
a O
decade O
had O
been O
a O
bicycle O
hooker O
, O
but O
since O
last O
summer O
he O
's O
been O
in O
the O
sports O
director O
's O
clothing O
for O
the O
Women B-ORG
's I-ORG
Team I-ORG
of O
the O
Trentino O
. O

How O
did O
this O
collaboration O
with O
the O
team B-ORG
come O
about O
? O

" O
Even O
after O
I O
stopped O
pedaling O
seriously O
, O
the O
passion O
never O
went O
away O
. O

after O
participating O
in O
the O
Italian O
championships O
of O
urban O
walking O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
put O
myself O
back O
on O
my O
knees O
, O
and O
while O
I O
was O
on O
duty O
at O
Gigno O
Battisti O
, O
the O
Forti B-ORG
e I-ORG
Veloci I-ORG
stuntman O
, O
I O
was O
approached O
by O
Andrea B-PER
Martinelli I-PER
, O
the O
president O
of O
the O
women B-ORG
's I-ORG
team I-ORG
of O
Trento O
, O
who O
offered O
to O
work O
with O
me O
. O
" O

And O
from O
next O
season O
, O
there O
's O
going O
to O
be O
even O
more O
commitment O
. O

" O
That O
's O
right O
. O

I O
started O
last O
June O
, O
and O
I O
went O
to O
accompany O
Graziano B-PER
Calovi I-PER
and O
Manuela B-PER
Povolo I-PER
. O

But O
next O
season O
Graziano B-PER
is O
going O
to O
be O
in O
promotion O
and O
public O
relations O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
Manuela B-PER
and O
I O
are O
going O
to O
be O
in O
girls O
. O
" O

Girls O
who O
are O
going O
to O
be O
many O
more O
. O

" O
This O
year O
it O
was O
five O
, O
and O
next O
year O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
15 O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

there O
will O
be O
new O
ones O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
G6 B-ORG
, O
from O
the O
societies O
of O
the O
judiciary B-LOC
, O
of O
Vallagarina B-LOC
, O
of O
the O
Valley B-LOC
of I-LOC
Cembra I-LOC
, O
of O
Rotaliana B-LOC
, O
maybe O
even O
of O
Bolzano B-LOC
. O
" O

That O
's O
a O
good O
commitment O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
should O
be O
a O
pleasure O
to O
be O
the O
reference O
society O
of O
the O
whole O
province B-LOC
. O

But O
, O
provocatively O
, O
would O
n't O
you O
be O
happier O
if O
you O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
exclusive O
? O

So O
yours O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
is O
a O
leadership O
offspring O
of O
a O
shortage O
of O
female O
societies O
. O

" O
In O
fact O
, O
we O
would O
be O
thrilled O
to O
be O
able O
to O
deal O
with O
other O
realities O
like O
ours O
. O

The O
more O
you O
are O
, O
the O
better O
for O
everyone O
. O

The O
other O
reason O
why O
the O
Women B-ORG
's I-ORG
Team I-ORG
Trenton I-ORG
was O
born O
is O
because O
the O
square O
does O
n't O
offer O
anything O
to O
girls O
who O
after O
the O
" O
Youngest B-ORG
" O
category O
want O
to O
continue O
. O

So O
that O
was O
the O
main O
reason O
I O
took O
up O
this O
challenge O
. O

to O
allow O
young O
athletes O
to O
continue O
to O
nurture O
their O
passion O
. O
" O

Accepting O
a O
challenge O
, O
however O
, O
also O
means O
meeting O
strangers O
. O

Any O
fear O
? O

No O
, O
I O
had O
someone O
about O
the O
numerical O
consistency O
of O
the O
group O
. O
Fifteen O
athletes O
together O
are O
not O
easy O
to O
manage O
. O
There O
's O
always O
a O
risk O
that O
there O
's O
some O
slippage O
or O
misunderstanding O
. O

But O
after O
three O
days O
at O
Lavarone B-LOC
a O
month O
ago O
, O
all O
the O
doubts O
went O
away O
. O

It O
's O
really O
a O
nice O
, O
united O
, O
serious O
group O
. O
" O

To O
close O
, O
let O
's O
expand O
the O
horizons O
. O

Looking O
to O
the O
future O
of O
the O
women O
's O
movement O
, O
how O
much O
weight O
could O
the O
good O
results O
from O
the O
blue O
girls O
in O
Verona B-LOC
have O
? O

" O
More O
than O
good O
, O
they O
did O
better O
than O
the O
men O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
return O
is O
immediate O
, O
especially O
in O
our O
small O
reality O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
looking O
at O
Italy B-LOC
in O
general O
, O
it O
might O
be O
useful O
to O
grow O
this O
world O
. O

even O
among O
the O
elite B-ORG
women O
, O
the O
points O
of O
the O
various O
teams O
are O
almost O
all O
foreign O
, O
maybe O
the O
medals O
of O
the O
Bastianelli B-PER
and O
even O
more O
than O
Guderzo B-PER
will O
push O
the O
women O

pedal O
up O
. O
" O

The O
phenomenon O
is O
on O
the O
decline O
, O
but O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
there O
were O
quite O
a O
few O
reports O
. O

The O
community B-LOC
: O

" O

" O
Unfortunately O
, O
these O
things O

It O
's O
rarer O
than O
in O
the O
past O
, O
but O
some O
cases O
still O
occur O
. O
" O

At O
the O
Commonwealth O
Network B-ORG
Service I-ORG
, O
the O
geographer O
Claudio B-PER
Albertani I-PER
does O
n't O
deny O
that O
sad O
episodes O
like O
the O
one O
told O
by O
Adige B-ORG
can O
sometimes O
happen O
. O

In O
the O
Commons B-LOC
, O
they O
explain O
that O
up O
until O
three O
years O
ago O
, O
before O
the O
introduction O
of O
the O
£ O
100,000 O
single O
subscription O
, O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
reports O
of O
people O
trading O
. O

Most O
of O
them O
were O
kids O
who O
, O
maybe O
for O
fun O
, O
were O
stopped O
by O
the O
gatekeepers O
and O
provided O
false O
graphic O
information O
. O

It O
's O
hard O
for O
Trentino B-ORG
Transportation I-ORG
's O
staff O
to O
check O
availability O
, O
if O
not O
to O
force O
the O
stop O
to O
show O
a O
driver O
's O
license O
. O

Then O
, O
fortunately O
, O
the O
problem O
seems O
to O
have O
gotten O
worse O
, O
even O
though O
some O
reports O
are O
coming O
in O
from O
the O
office O
every O
now O
and O
then O
. O

They O
're O
aware O
of O
this O
risk O
in O
the O
community B-LOC
, O
and O
so O
they O
set O
up O
an O
ad O
hoc O
procedure O
to O
allow O
the O
unwitting O
actors O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
without O
having O
to O
pay O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
shame O
if O
the O
victim O
of O
such O
a O
silly O
joke O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
an O
infringing O
act O
. O

And O
only O
later O
could O
he O
ask O
for O
a O
refund O
. O

Albertani B-PER

- O
first O
capital O
of O
the O
mountain O
more O
visibility O
. O
" O

Even O
though O
it O
's O
a O
high O
- O
quality O
film O
, O
the O
Film O
Festival O
has O
never O
found O
a O
large O
space O
in O
the O
national O
media O
. O

Why O
is O
that O
? O

" O
The O
Trent B-LOC
Festival O
is O
incredibly O
undervalued O
by O
the O
national O
media O
, O
both O
in O
the O
press O
and O
on O
TV O
. O

There O
's O
nobody O
in O
Italy B-LOC
to O
make O
it O
known O
. O

It O
certainly O
has O
to O
have O
a O
larger O
window O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
stop O
. O

But O
beyond O
some O
national O
TV O
footage O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
bring O
the O
demonstration O
online O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
bring O
it O
online O
, O
and O
we O
're O
going O
to O
make O
it O
accessible O
to O
a O
very O
large O
audience O
, O
not O
just O
traditional O
passionate O
people O
. O
" O

The O
risk O
is O
sometimes O
that O
it O
's O
reduced O
to O
a O
sectoral O
festival O
, O
for O
a O
few O
professionals O
. O

" O
It O
's O
a O
risk O
we O
have O
to O
avoid O
. O

So O
, O
while O
preserving O
the O
festival O
style O
, O
we O
need O
to O
reach O
a O
wider O
audience O
, O
and O
a O
greater O
visibility O
outside O
of O
the O
city O
. O

Last O
year O
, O
when O
I O
was O
touring O
for O
Trent B-LOC
, O
I O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
the O
festival O
was O
in O
a O
non O
- O
European O
way O
, O
the O
city O
did O
n't O
feel O
it O
. O
" O

What O
kind O
of O
projects O
does O
he O
have O
in O
mind O
? O

" O
You O
have O
to O
get O
restaurants O
organizing O
on O
the O
week O
of O
the O
festival O
, O
the O
schools O
in O
Trento O
get O
involved O
in O
the O
screenings O
, O
the O
streets O
of O
Trento B-LOC
get O
people O
involved O
in O
the O
Film O
Festival O
. O

I O
think O
of O
a O
projection O
in O
Dante B-LOC
Square I-LOC
or O
in O
Battisti B-LOC
Square I-LOC
. O

Then O
to O
projections O
in O
the O
rooms O
, O
to O
subjects O
. O

In O
one O
room O
, O
the O
retrospectives O
. O

The O
other O
ones O
are O
kids O
' O
movies O
. O

In O
the O
other O
one O
, O
the O
movies O
from O
the O
history O
archive O
of O
50 O
years O
of O
Film O
Festival O
. O
" O

Not O
everybody O
liked O
the O
slides O
in O
the O
living O
rooms O
. O

There O
were O
people O
replacing O
the O
auditorium O
. O

Will O
she O
go O
back O
to O
S.C. O
? O

" O
For O
me O
, O
it O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
bring O
the O
projections O
into O
the O
city O
. O

You O
can O
also O
bring O
them O
back O
to O
the O
auditorium O
, O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
bring O
back O
something O
self O

serving O

But O
the O

fundamentally O

a O

was O
the O

who O
, O
in O
an O

published O
by O
the O

, O
explained O
the O
reasons O
for O
his O
resignation O

" O
For O
a O
number O
of O
complex O
reasons O
, O
including O
the O
awareness O
that O
I O
no O
longer O
needed O
the O
full O
support O
of O
the O
competent O
authorities O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
leave O
my O
job O
as O
chief O
executive O
of O
Misna B-ORG

I O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
from O
one O

to O
the O
next O
, O
and O
, O
with O
all O
due O
respect O
, O
I O
leave O
the O

open O

in O
violation O

any O

" O

Father O

its O

So O
our O
goal O
was O
to O
give O
a O

, O
even O

it O

rarely O
finds O

what O

" O

a O
33 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
man O
with O
legs O
well O
planted O
on O

-- O
because O
when O
you O
have O
two O
children O
and O
a O
family O
, O
you O
have O
to O
make O
measured O
choices O
. O

In O
times O
of O
uncertainty O
like O
these O
, O
it O
's O
not O
the O
category O
that O
matters O
, O
it O
's O
the O
projects O
. O

and O
the O
company O
in O
Trento B-LOC
has O
one O
that O
's O
worth O
it O
. O
" O

And O
then O
, O
the O
team O
is O
strong O
. O

can O
point O
up O
. O

" O
We O
are O
well O
- O
equipped O
. O

Now O
, O
Maraner B-PER
has O
basically O
two O
men O
for O
each O
role O
. O

So O
there O
's O
a O
possibility O
of O
choosing O
by O
leveraging O
the O
form O
and O
the O
situations O
of O
the O
moment O
. O
" O

I O
'm O
back O
in O
yellow O
after O
12 O
years O

then O
it O
was O
called O
Thirty O

" O
I O
came O
from O
the O
Spring B-ORG

and O
for O
me O
it O
was O
a O
bet O

I O
had O
to O
figure O
out O
if O
I O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
pitcher O
or O
not O

I O
've O
been O
fortunate O
enough O
to O
meet O
a O
coach O
like O
Cavasin B-PER
who O
's O
given O
me O
confidence O
by O
making O
me O
a O
property O
owner O
and O
taught O
me O
a O
lot O

" O

And O
now O
again O
in O
Trento B-LOC

from O
Pescantina B-LOC

where O
Migliorini B-PER
lives O

the O
barbarian B-PER

the O
little O
Christians B-PER

two O

" O
Yesterday O

the O

that O
Z O

It O
was O
lightness O

I O
agree O

maybe O
he O
did O
n't O
remember O
being O
warned O
before O
. O

But O
as O
I O
said O
, O
our O
team O
is O
a O
team O
in O
which O
we O
're O
all O
the O

One O
comes O
out O

it O

what O
comes O

its O

It O

technically O

difficult O

most O

of O
the O
second O
half O
of O
the O
20th O
century O
, O
under O
the O
hands O
of O
this O
pianist O
is O
not O
only O
intelligible O
, O
but O
it O
's O
also O
stimulating O

In O
this O
performance O
, O
there O
were O
already O
all O
the O
musical O
qualities O
of O
Lucchesini B-PER
easily O
recognizable O
in O

The O
Russian O

Nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Lucchesini B-PER

control O
of O
sound O

his O
ability O
to O
sing O

his O
ability O
to O
produce O

Kamenz B-PER
, O
in O
his O
appearances O
at O
the O
Bosnian O
competition O
, O
made O
fun O
of O
the O

if O

A O

Only O
in O

the O
French O
champion O

a O
long O
period O

reflects O
on O
the O

Alessandro B-PER

closed O
until O
January O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
prolonged O
shutdown O
of O

would O
imply O
an O
acceleration O

Ibrahimovic B-PER
alone O
, O
as O
he O
's O
turning O
out O
to O
be O
an O
unlikely O
buyer O
, O
is O
not O
going O
to O
be O
enough O
for O
a O
team O
that O
's O
engaged O
on O
more O
fronts O
like O
Juventus B-ORG

And O
Zalayeta B-PER
, O
even O
though O
she O
's O
already O
scored O
a O
decisive O
goal O
, O
remains O
an O
unknown O
by O
far O
. O

Fortunately O
for O
Juve B-ORG
, O
the O
uncertainties O
of O
the O
attack O
are O
offset O
by O
the O
safety O
of O
the O

" O
Last O

I O
did O

have O
an O
easy O
season O
because O
I O
was O

doing O
well O

" O
the O
French O
defenseman O
said O
, O
" O
I O
had O
a O
bad O
knee O
injury O
in O
my O
first O
game O
against O
the O
Empoli B-ORG

and O
I O
played O
only O
for O
the O
Europeans O
. O
" O

Thuram B-PER
has O
a O
clear O
idea O
for O
defense O
-- O
Juventus B-ORG
bunker O
. O

" O
When O
you O
score O
a O
few O
goals O
-- O
he O
pointed O
out O
-- O
it O
's O
all O
due O
to O
the O
team O
that O
's O
working O
so O
well O
. O

Cannavar B-PER
, O
Buffon B-PER
and O
I O
are O
all O
affluent O
, O
and O
playing O
alongside O
Fabio B-PER
makes O
things O
easier O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
really O
all O
credit O
to O
us O
. O

In O
any O
case O
-- O
Thuram B-PER
added O
-- O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
whole O
championship O
before O
you O
can O
make O
a O
final O
judgment O
. O

We O
're O
doing O
fine O
, O
but O
you O
can O
start O
well O
and O
end O
badly O
, O
or O
vice O

. O

And O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
big O
ones O
in O
trouble O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
they O
'll O
be O
right O
in O
front O
of O
us O

" O

Thuram B-PER
tries O
to O
mask O
his O
concerns O
about O
the O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
and O
Trezeguet B-PER
injuries O
: O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
exactly O
what O
they O

" O

said O

I O
hope O
they O
're O
not O
out O
for O
long O
. O
" O

If O
they O
do O
n't O
score O
, O
Juventus B-PER
might O
have O
trouble O
signing O

and O
already O
in O
the O
last O
couple O
of O
games O
they O
've O
reduced O
the O
number O

" O
It O

the O
fault O

close O
their O
half O

fields O

that O

Thuram B-PER

thesis O

and O
give O
up O

In O
this O

it O

With O

By O
LUISA B-PER
PATRUNO I-PER

For O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
, O
it O
's O
a O
delicate O
transition O
. O

it O
has O
to O
cut O
the O
beauty O
of O
three O
percent O
of O
the O
budget O
, O
which O
means O
, O
compared O
to O
the O
3.943 O
million O
euros O
in O
2004 O
assessment O
, O
it O
has O
to O
give O
up O
about O
120 O
million O
euros O
. O

And O
it O
has O
to O
decide O
what O
to O
target O
and O
what O
to O
sacrifice O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
he O
announced O
to O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
heads O
that O
he O
was O
not O
going O
to O
present O
the O
2005 O
budget O
in O
time O
to O
avoid O
the O
midterm O
review O
. O

" O
We O
're O
going O
to O
approve O
it O
by O
the O
end O
of O
November O
instead O
of O
by O
October O
, O
" O
the O
provincial B-LOC
president O
said O
, O
" O
so O
that O
the O
exam O
in O
committee O
can O
start O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
January O
and O
be O
approved O
in O
the O
classroom O
in O
February O
. O
" O

We O
're O
waiting O
for O
the O
government O
's O
fiscal O
maneuver O
to O
come O
up O
with O
the O
finances O
, O
without O
which O
we O
wo O
n't O
know O
exactly O
what O
and O
how O
many O
resources O
we O
can O
count O
on O
. O
" O

So O
effectively O
, O
the O
province B-LOC
is O
forced O
to O
slide O
into O
practice O
on O
a O
temporary O
basis O
for O
external O
reasons O
and O
not O
to O
risk O
preparing O
an O
accounting O
document O
that O
might O
then O
be O
put O
on O
hold O
. O

But O
the O
delay O
remains O
a O
sign O
of O
difficulty O
, O
which O
the O
rating O
agencies O
, O
which O
have O
hitherto O
awarded O
our O
province B-LOC
, O
may O
not O
ignore O
in O
next O
year O
's O
judgment O
. O

Provisional O
work O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
means O
that O
for O
the O
first O
few O
months O
of O
the O
year O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
confine O
ourselves O
to O
the O
administration O
. O

And O
more O
than O
one O
assessor O
had O
disagreed O
with O
this O
choice O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
's O
not O
just O
the O
time O
of O
Minister O
Siniscalco B-PER
and O
Berlusconi B-PER
in O
the O
wake O
of O
Dellai B-PER
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
the O
last O
few O
weeks O
, O
the O
president O
has O
confronted O
his O
cabinet B-ORG
, O
has O
shown O
the O
numbers O
and O
the O
predictions O
, O
and O
has O
asked O
for O
a O
responsible O
attitude O
. O

And O
then O
he O
sent O
out O
a O
letter O
-- O
it O
's O
these O
days O
-- O
to O
every O
councillor O
basically O
asking O
them O
to O
indicate O
their O
priorities O
and O
, O
most O
importantly O
, O
what O
and O
how O
much O
-- O
in O
percentages O
-- O
they O
were O
willing O
to O
cut O
in O
relation O
to O
their O
2004 O
budget O
, O
expressing O
the O
need O
to O
achieve O
a O
reduction O
overall O
-- O
across O
the O
board O
-- O
of O
even O
three O
percent O
. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
province B-LOC
, O
for O
the O
policy O
that O
this O
center O
- O
left O
government O
has O
taken O
, O
does O
n't O
mean O
cutting O
the O
welfare O
state O
, O
particularly O
health O
care O
, O
or O
welfare O
state O
, O
even O
though O
many O
of O
the O
proposed O
programs O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
be O
re O
- O
engineered O
, O
and O
research O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
Dellai B-PER
wants O
to O
respect O
the O
stability O
pact O
with O
the O
state O
and O
not O
be O
declassified O
by O
rating O
agencies O
. O

So O
, O
the O
direction O
that O
's O
emerging O
is O
that O
the O
sectors O
that O
are O
going O
to O
have O
to O
sacrifice O
more O
are O
going O
to O
be O
: O

culture O
, O
public O
jobs O
and O
economic O
compartments O
. O

So O
there O
's O
going O
to O
be O
fewer O
resources O
for O
museums O
, O
for O
bands O
, O
for O
associations O
, O
for O
streets O
, O
for O
sports O
buildings O
, O
for O
fire O
departments O
in O
every O
corner O
of O
the O
country B-LOC
, O
but O
even O
fewer O
contributions O
and O
initiatives O
to O
support O
economic O
activity O
. O

It O
's O
going O
to O
try O
to O
" O
repair O
" O
the O
engagement O
represented O
by O
the O
territorial O
footprints O
, O
which O
are O
overwhelming O
the O
resources O
. O

That O
's O
just O
to O
quote O
some O
of O
the O
most O
risky O
voices O
. O

For O
Dellai B-PER
, O
this O
maneuver O
is O
not O
just O
the O
forecast O
budget O
for O
2005 O
, O
but O
it O
will O
have O
to O
represent O
, O
as O
he O
calls O
it O
, O
a O
" O
legislation O
budget O
, O
" O
which O
means O
a O
blueprint O
of O
how O
much O
your O
government O
can O
afford O
to O
do O
or O
not O
do O
in O
the O
remaining O
four O
years O
, O
knowing O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
the O
fiscal O
trend O
of O
the O
legislature O
, O
according O
to O
the O
forecasts O
, O
at O
worst O
- O
case O
scenarios O
, O
can O
be O
as O
high O
as O
" O
less O
than O
eight O
percent O
" O
of O
the O
2004 O
budget O
. O

Looking O
ahead O
, O
Dellai B-PER
is O
trying O
to O
find O
the O
broadest O
possible O
sharing O
-- O
even O
of O
economic O
and O
social O
categories O
-- O
of O
the O
priorities O
that O
his O
government O
is O
going O
to O
decide O
to O
give O
itself O
. O

That O
's O
why O
you O
're O
expecting O

It O
's O
clear O
that O
trade O

do O
n't O
want O
to O
retreat O
. O

So O
, O
sacrifices O
are O
going O
to O
be O
made O
by O
everybody O
, O
but O
Cgil B-ORG
, O
Cisl B-ORG

remember O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
that O
there O

A O
word O
to O
Ruggero B-PER
Purin I-PER
, O
number O

at O
Cgil B-ORG
: O

" O
The O
budget O
cuts O
were O
partly O
anticipated O
, O
but O
the O
three O
percent O
reduction O
is O
worrying O
. O
" O

So O
far O
, O
there O
have O
been O
no O
clashes O
between O
the O
parties O
, O
but O
Purin B-PER
immediately O
points O
out O
a O
few O
things O
: O

" O
We O
're O
going O
through O
a O
delicate O
phase O
, O
which O
involves O
investing O
in O
the O
development O
of O
the O
economy O
, O
in O
the O

, O
in O
favor O
of O
the O

We O
'll O
see O
the O
official O

-- O
Purin B-PER
goes O
on O

but O
these O
are O
our O
conditions O

Ermanno B-PER

" O
We O
've O
been O

to O
President O

asking O
for O
additional O

on O

We O

" O

First O
cause O
of O
controversy O

But O
that O
's O
not O
all O
. O

" O
Many O
other O

have O
long O
adopted O
the O
DFP O
, O
whereas O
the O
province B-LOC
is O
just O
presenting O
the O

. O

And O
to O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
important O
to O
know O
what O
the O
government B-ORG
's O
income O
and O
investment O
policy O
is O
. O
" O

According O
to O
Monari B-PER
, O
the O
historic O
moment O
is O
so O
troubling O
that O
it O
" O
musts O
motivate O
not O
just O
unions O
but O
civil O
society O
as O
a O
whole O
to O
engage O
" O
in O
the O
Triennial B-LOC

policies O
. O

Even O
according O
to O
the O
Uil B-ORG
secretary O
, O
even O
a O
declining O
budget O
has O
to O
" O
studie O
" O
what O
are O
the O
most O
effective O
weapons O
to O
counteract O
the O
unhappy O
moment O
of O
the O
1930s O
economy O
. O

" O
For O
years O
, O
we O
've O
been O
asking O
for O
general O
involvement O
on O
the O
policies O
to O
be O
implemented O
against O
the O
industrial O
crisis O
, O
" O
Molinari B-PER
concludes O
. O
" O
In O
conversation O
, O
we O
'd O
need O
to O
rationalize O
spending O

Dell B-PER

These O
are O
also O
going O

topics O
this O
morning O

after O
the O

against O
the O

, O
there O
will O
be O
a O

" O
We O
're O
worried O
, O
because O
the O
three O
percent O
reduction O
in O
the O
budget O
is O
important O
and O
could O
have O
a O
two O

impact O
on O
some O

areas O
as O
well O
. O

When O
the O
budget O
is O
down O
, O
investment O
is O
at O
risk O
, O
but O
Trentino B-LOC
absolutely O
needs O
a O
series O
of O
interventions O
to O
get O
the O

back O
on O

" O

So O
, O
in O
these O

Not O

to O

and O
the O
whole O
fabric O

that O

Because O
breastfeeding O
is O
a O
desire O

almost O
all O
thirty O

" O
It O

very O
rare O
-- O
the O

pointed O
out O

that O
a O

asks O
not O

Cultural O

Now O
it O
's O
up O

all O

it O
was O
really O

they O

according O
to O
a O
2003 O

There O

- O
two O
percent O

but O
this O

should O
be O
increased O
, O
because O
these O
are O
valuable O

valuable O
opportunities O
would O
be O

the O

The O

Who O

story O

the O
research O

and O
the O
new O

a O
debate O

with O
students O

the O
Don B-ORG
Milani I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
with O
archaeologist O
Umberto B-PER
Tecchiati I-PER
, O
of O
the O
Office B-ORG
of I-ORG
Archaeology I-ORG
in O
Bolzano B-LOC
. O

According O
to O
medical O
reports O
, O
the O
man O
on O
the O
ice O
was O
definitely O
killed O
by O
a O
arrow O
that O
hit O
him O
in O
the O
back O
. O

Who O
was O
this O
man O
who O
wore O
a O
copper O
axe O
and O
why O
was O
he O
killed O
, O
those O
were O
the O
two O
questions O
at O
the O
center O
of O
the O
debate O
. O

He O
was O
certainly O
a O
high O
- O
ranking O
man O
. O

he O
was O
carrying O
a O
high O
- O
class O
object O
, O
a O
steel O
axle O
. O

He O
was O
holding O
a O
knife O
in O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
his O
body O
was O
showing O
signs O
of O
collapse O
. O

The O
most O
recent O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
a O
shepherd O
was O
murdered O
for O
his O
clergy O
. O

" O
But O
if O
that O
's O
the O
case O
-- O
Tecchiati B-PER
explained O
-- O
why O
did O
n't O
they O
steal O
his O
ax O
, O
an O
object O
of O
enormous O
value O
at O
the O
time O
? O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
" O

Another O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
a O
shaman O
, O
a O
religious O
man O
, O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
himself O
for O
his O
people O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
explain O
, O
even O
in O
this O
case O
, O
the O
weapons O
he O
was O
given O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
death O
and O
the O
blow O
to O
his O
back O
. O

In O
archaeologically O
documented O
cases O
of O
human O
sacrifice O
, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
ritual O
slaughter O
, O
with O
a O
arrow O
strapped O
to O
the O
back O
from O
a O
remarkable O
distance O
at O
a O
speed O
of O
up O
to O
140 O
kilometers O
. O

According O
to O
Tecchiati B-PER
, O
he O
was O
certainly O
a O
high O
- O
ranking O
man O
, O
a O
survivor O
, O
because O
at O
a O
time O
when O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
reach O
the O
age O
of O
thirty O
, O
Oetzi B-PER
was O
killed O
when O
he O
was O
over O
40 O
. O

Poor O
articular O
bone O
marrow O
is O
a O
life O
without O
physical O
stress O
, O
so O
it O
excludes O
the O
shepherd O
's O
hypothesis O
. O

Tattoos O
on O
the O
body O
are O
not O
proof O
of O
a O
specific O
caste O
like O
the O
shaman O
, O
because O
the O
most O
plausible O
explanation O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
magical O
taumaturgy O
, O
which O
is O
reserved O
for O
a O
particular O
man O
, O
but O
not O
necessarily O
a O
religious O
man O
. O

Ötzi B-PER

they O
explain O
that O

not O

The O

therefore O
, O
tends O

at O

according O
to O
the O
analysis O
of O

to O
close O

The O
film O
at O
times O
brings O
to O
mind O
the O
old O
Antonioni B-PER
Blow O
up O
, O
but O
without O
his O
almost O
metaphysical O
claims O
, O
to O
lead O
us O
with O
his O
rapid O
language O
into O
the O
appealing O
variety O
of O
alpine O

into O
the O
progressive O

of O
a O

The O

about O

Mado B-PER

It O
's O
a O

that O
Presidents O
Flavio B-PER

will O
sign O
, O
this O

Framework O
Convention O
for O

It O
's O
a O
story O
because O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
the O
board O
of O
directors O
on O
the O
Brenner B-LOC
Street I-LOC
had O
never O
been O
held O
accountable O
not O
only O
for O
the O

but O
, O
more O
generally O
, O
for O
the O
educational O
system O
, O
the O
academic O
system O
in O

. O

Tosi B-PER

most O
recent O
" O

are O
from O

, O
most O

, O
to O
the O
Riva B-LOC

. O

In O
both O
cases O
, O
he O
asked O
for O
more O
collaboration O
with O
small O

as O
well O
. O

Soldiers O
who O
had O
, O
in O
part O
, O
found O
important O
jobs O
in O
the O
provincial B-ORG

then O
culminated O
in O
an O

of O
a O

from O
across O
the O
Brenner B-LOC
to O
the O

of O

So O
today O

protocol O
reinforces O
the O
" O
new O
course O
" O
of O
the O
relationship O
between O
craftsmanship O
and O
the O
research O
world O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
's O
an O
idea O
that O
comes O
to O
the O
end O
of O
a O
path O
of O
approximation O
, O
in O
which O
forms O
of O
cooperation O
have O
already O
begun O
, O
mainly O
through O
the O
CEEI B-ORG
and O
the O
Conit B-ORG
, O
the O
third O

party O
development O
consortium O
. O

The O
protocol O
then O
identifies O
common O
working O
hypotheses O
and O
identifies O
possible O
areas O
of O
intervention O
. O

The O
goal O
is O
to O
" O
develop O
initiatives O
of O
common O
interest O
and O
to O
facilitate O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
the O
collaboration O
between O

, O

it O
difficult O
to O

the O
meaning O

out O

Which O
, O
obviously O
considering O
opening O
up O
a O
branch O
of O
an O
institution O
, O
Volksbank B-ORG
-- O
excellent O
bank O
, O
but O
not O
exactly O
a O
credit O
crunch O
that O
could O
colonize O

markets O
-- O
as O
an O
intolerable O
and O
deadly O
threat O
, O
has O
forgotten O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
. O

The O
first O
is O
that O
, O
among O
the O
many O
powers O
of O
the O
province B-LOC
and O
its O
councillors O
, O
there O
is O
no O
one O
to O
prevent O
a O
company O
from O
doing O
their O
job O
, O
and O
to O
do O
it O
in O
Trieste B-LOC
, O
if O
they O
believe O
that O
they O
can O
do O
it O
for O
profit O
. O

Whether O
it O
's O
based O
in O
Bolzano B-LOC
or O
Shanghai B-LOC
, O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
. O

The O
interference O
of O
a O
politician O
and O
a O
CEO O
in O
market O
affairs O
is O
, O
yes O
, O
intolerable O
. O

Unless O
condemning O
a O
conflict O
of O
interest O
is O
only O
for O
some O
and O
not O
for O
others O
. O

The O
second O
thing O
Grisenti B-PER
forgot O
is O
that O
it O
's O
still O
a O
little O
bit O
late O
to O
go O
into O
the O
field O
today O
. O

" O
We O
are O
not O
land O
of O
conquest O
, O
" O
he O
shouted O
. O

Frankly O
, O
nobody O
noticed O
. O

And O
nobody O
, O
probably O
, O
will O
believe O
us O
, O
after O
, O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
the O
thirty O
largest O
banks O
went O
under O
the O
control O
of O
big O
national O
groups O
. O

The O
war O
against O
conquest O
had O
to O
be O
fought O
, O
eventually O
, O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
the O
wealthy O
plutocrats O
who O
were O
selling O
the O
control O
of O
our O
banks O
were O
making O
the O
Babau O
of O
colonization O
less O
fearful O
. O

Useless O
, O
now O
, O
to O
take O
it O
with O
those O
who O
have O
resisted O
those O
temptations O
. O

Let O
's O
start O
with O
the O
Sparkasse B-ORG
, O
which O
in O
Trento B-LOC
very O
soon O
is O
going O
to O
open O
up O
a O
bridgehead O
, O
and O
which O
is O
already O
worrying O
, O
more O
than O
the O
political O
buildings O
, O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
competing O
institutions O
. O

What O
's O
Grisenti B-PER
going O
to O
do O
when O
Sparkasse B-ORG
opens O
its O
30th O
headquarters O
? O

The O
third O
thing O
that O
the O
referee O
forgot O
, O
is O
that O
the O
final O
judge O
on O
the O
credit O
challenge O
will O
be O
the O
consumer O
, O
who O
can O
decide O
to O
transfer O
their O
account O
from O
a O
rural O
to O
a O
high O
- O
income O
one O
and O
vice O
versa O
, O
maybe O
creating O
better O
conditions O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
new O
mechanism O

's O
called O

concern O

of O

go O
on O
for O
a O
long O

I O
myself O

I O

it O
guarantees O

it O
penalizes O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
vote O
for O
it O
because O
of O
party O
discipline O
. O
" O

The O
local O
authority O
auditor O
believes O
that O
there O
's O
a O
real O
risk O
that O
the O
community O
law O
will O
not O

time O

and O
he O

that O
his O

turn O
out O

unnecessary O

" O
I O
ran O

I O
'm O
here O

just O
to O

" O

Amistadi B-PER
has O
given O
himself O
this O
mission O
, O

, O
in O

to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
goal O
is O
to O
get O
there O

Remembering O
teacher O
Marchetti B-PER

This O
morning O
at O
11 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
in O
the O
church O
of O
Trento B-LOC
Cemetery O
, O
will O
be O
the O
funeral O
of O
Professor O
Maria B-PER
Matteucci I-PER
Marchetti I-PER

who O
taught O
Italian O
first O
at O
the O
classical B-ORG
high I-ORG
school I-ORG
in O
Prati O
and O
then O
at O
the O
Galilean B-ORG
scientist I-ORG
. O

So O
that O
's O
what O
teacher O
Lia B-PER
Guardini I-PER
remembers O
. O

" O
I O
met O
Maria B-PER
Matteucci I-PER
Marchetti I-PER
on O
" O
Prati B-ORG
, O
" O
where O
she O
's O
like O
a O
meteor O
, O
for O
a O
few O
years O
. O

It O
's O
high O
and O
it O
's O
serious O
and O
it O
's O
serious O
, O
and O
it O
's O
got O
that O
kind O
of O
rough O
air O
on O
the O
face O
. O

It O
's O
also O
hard O
to O
talk O
at O
first O
. O

Then O
there O
's O
something O
that O
becomes O
a O
real O
, O
honest O
friendship O
, O
with O
highs O
and O
lows O
like O
all O
long O
- O
term O
friendships O
, O
a O
beautiful O
lifetime O
. O

Friendship O
means O
to O
spend O
hours O
and O
nights O
and O
nights O
together O
reading O
and O
studying O
and O
discussing O
, O
but O
she O
talks O
more O
and O
more O
because O
she O
knows O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
and O
she O
's O
really O
capable O
of O
engaging O
and O
fascinating O
. O

Being O
a O
friend O
means O
studying O
, O
but O
also O
making O
sure O
you O
laugh O
and O
taking O
a O
stroll O
on O
Lake B-LOC
Garda I-LOC
, O
or O
going O
to O
mushrooms O
up O
there O
, O
in O
the O
Sun B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
, O
in O
Cusiano B-LOC
. O

Yeah O
, O
she O
laughs O
, O
" O
I O
'm O
30 O
, O
" O
with O
her O
unmistakable O
Toscan O
accent O
. O

The O
dominant O
thing O
is O
still O
the O
study O
. O

It O
was O
a O
beautiful O
school O
. O

because O
she O
, O
Mary B-PER
, O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
talk O
about O
difficult O
and O
serious O
and O
challenging O
things O
with O
the O
lightness O
of O
curiosity O
, O
the O
accuracy O
of O
analysis O
and O
criticism O
, O
the O
accuracy O
of O
judgment O
. O

But O
it O
's O
painful O
and O
difficult O
to O
talk O
about O
now O
. O

So O
, O
even O
though O
in O
the O
background O
there O
's O
the O
gallery O
of O
authors O
of O
literature O
and O
there O
's O
a O
long O
theory O
of O
criticism O
and O
there O
's O
her O
passion O
and O
enthusiasm O
, O
Mary B-PER
today O
dominates O
the O
final O
image O
, O
the O
one O
of O
long O
suffering O
, O
of O
ever O
- O
growing O
difficulty O
and O
hardship O
in O
life O
. O

Mary B-PER
continues O
to O
struggle O
and O
to O
devour O
books O
, O
obsessively O
, O
almost O
exaggerating O
the O
problem O
of O
life O
going O
away O
, O
and O
the O
problem O
of O
death O
that O
this O
time O
is O
not O
written O
on O
a O
textbook O
but O
is O
implanted O
in O
your O
body O
and O
consumes O
you O
. O

And O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
. O

You O
have O
to O
be O
wise O
like O
Francesco B-PER
to O
say O
, O
" O
Praise O
be O
to O
you O
, O
my O
Lord B-PER
, O
for O
your O
very O
death O
. O
" O

Ordinary O
people O
experience O
, O
it O
's O
inevitable O
, O
weariness O
when O
they O
cross O
the O
last O
line O
of O
things O
, O
beyond O
which O
we O
are O
dust O
and O
shadow O
. O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
understand O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
that O
in O
addition O
to O
losing O
those O
who O
are O
left O
behind O
, O
there O
are O
also O
reasons O
for O
consolation O
. O

There O
'll O
also O
be O
little O
to O
lose O
in O
the O
face O
of O
loss O
, O
but O
at O
least O
there O
are O
. O

In O
the O
dust O
of O
the O
retreat O
, O
you O
can O
finally O
find O
the O
serenity O
and O
the O
bigness O
and O
not O
the O
rustiness O
. O

is O
no O
longer O
burdened O
by O
suffering O
and O
disease O
. O

And O
then O
she O
stayed O
in O
her O
home O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
her O
stuff O
and O
her O
books O
and O
the O
environment O
of O
her O
life O
. O

With O
the O
man O
outside O
the O
window O
and O
the O
hours O
ringing O
, O
difficult O
especially O
in O
the O
endless O
and O
stretching O
length O
of O
the O
night O
. O

It O
's O
going O
to O
be O
hard O
and O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
easy O
, O
but O
you O
can O
think O
and O
you O
can O
hope O
that O
Mary B-PER
is O
happy O
that O
she O
's O
been O
escorted O
so O
far O
from O
the O
finish O
line O
. O

And O
you O
can O
only O
add O
, O
to O
paraphrase O
an O
ancient O
poet O
, O
that O
" O
if O
any O
kind O
of O
sweetness O
can O
come O
to O
the O
dead O
from O
our O
pain O
, O
from O
the O

But O
beyond O

the O

-- O
says O
Uil B-ORG

is O
a O

the O

not O

rather O
governed O

To O
do O
that O
, O
Monari B-PER

" O
it O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O

The O
bad O
news O
is O
this O
: O

the O
Euro O
1 O
diesel O
vehicles O
that O
last O
winter O
, O
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
five O
- O
day O
spike O
in O
the O
values O
of O
the O
fine O
dust O
, O
were O
stopped O
this O
year O
will O
be O
able O
to O
circulate O
. O

This O
is O
the O
specification O
of O
the O
Appa B-ORG
after O
the O
different O
communication O
that O
was O
made O
yesterday O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Provincial B-LOC
, O
Technical O
and O
Common O
Meeting O
. O

So O
only O
Euro O
zero O
will O
be O
forced O
to O
stand O
. O

And O
maybe O
not O
even O
those O
. O

Or O
at O
least O
, O
not O
all O
of O
them O
. O

In O
the O
program O
agreement O
that O
the O
Province B-LOC
presented O
yesterday O
, O
as O
a O
basis O
for O
discussion O
waiting O
to O
be O
put O
together O
the O
observations O
that O
will O
come O
from O
the O
municipalities O
next O
week O
, O
it O
is O
actually O
possible O
to O
grant O
a O
derogation O
from O
circulation O
( O
as O
of O
November O
1 O
, O
2005 O
) O
to O
bus O
owners O
who O
commit O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
to O
replacing O
their O
" O
old O
" O
buses O
with O
cleaner O
ones O
. O

Basically O
, O
if O
the O
owner O
of O
a O
non O
- O
catalysis O
car O
or O
a O
Euro O
0 O
diesel O
car O
signed O
a O
kind O
of O
contract O
with O
the O
province B-LOC
in O
which O
they O
formalized O
their O
intention O
to O
replace O
their O
pollutant O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
triennial O
plan O
, O
they O
would O
get O
some O
sort O
of O
salvage O
so O
that O
they O
could O
travel O
at O
any O
time O
of O
the O
year O
-- O
and O
especially O
in O
any O
weather O
condition O
-- O
on O
the O
roads O
that O
would O
otherwise O
be O
off O
- O
limits O
to O
them O
. O

The O
proposal O
, O
which O
is O
surely O
already O
quite O
appealing O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
, O
could O
actually O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
unlikely O
if O
it O
crosses O
the O
line O
of O
some O
ordinary O
people O
who O
, O
unbeknownst O
to O
them O
, O
would O
have O
already O
given O
the O
assessor O
their O
intention O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
derogation O
to O
be O
activated O
as O
early O
as O
this O
winter O
. O

On O
his O
side O
, O
Judge O
Gilmozzi B-PER
goes O
to O
court O
. O

It O
's O
a O
delicate O
matter O
, O
and O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
at O
stake O
. O

" O
First O
of O
all O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
it O
's O
important O
to O
say O
that O
this O
is O
a O
proposal O
. O

it O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
be O
discussed O
with O
everybody O
in O
the O
community O
. O

On O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
derogs O
, O
it O
will O
then O
be O
up O
to O
the O
individual O
governments O
to O
decide O
who O
will O
issue O
the O
circulation O
permit O
despite O
the O
blocks O
, O
not O
necessarily O
the O
province B-LOC
. O
" O

The O
risk O
, O
easy O
to O
grasp O
, O
is O
that O
if O
ordinary O
people O
were O
to O
be O
rather O
indulgent O
in O
letting O
go O
, O
very O
few O
polluting O
vehicles O
would O
remain O
stuck O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Judge O
Gilmozzi B-PER
says O
the O
way O
for O
the O
old O
- O
generation O
diesel O
and O
gasoline O
units O
-- O
two O
days O
a O
week O
-- O
is O
to O
start O
on O
November O
15th O
. O

Before O
that O
date O
, O
even O
though O
the O
constraints O
were O
lifted O
yesterday O
-- O
and O
for O
the O
seventh O
day O
in O
a O
row O
-- O
there O
will O
be O
no O
traffic O
constraints O
. O

" O
It O
would O
only O
create O
confusion O
, O
" O
says O
Gilmozzi B-PER
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
community O
- O
province B-LOC
program O
agreement O
sets O
out O
the O
central O
government O
's O
commitment O
to O
define O
within O
180 O
days O
the O
operational O
lines O
for O
the O
expansion O
of O
the O
methane O
automotive O
distribution O

according O

-- O
yesterday O
, O
the O
former O
employer O
of O
Simonetta B-PER
, O
Salvatore B-PER

, O
was O
heard O
-- O
could O
be O
connected O

a O

A O
thread O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
identity O
of O
Simonetta B-PER

murderer O

a O
man O
that O
she O
knew O
well O
and O
with O
whom O
she O
might O
even O
have O
had O
a O
sentimental O
connection O

But O
there O
's O
more O
. O

the O
P.M. O
may O
decide O
in O
the O
next O
few O
weeks O
to O
interrogate O
old O
or O
new O
protagonists O
of O
the O
yellow O
and O
then O
turn O
its O
attention O
back O
to O
the O
mystery O
apartment O
building O
itself O
. O

The O
revelation O
that O
actually O
opens O
up O
a O
new O
chapter O
in O
the O
story O
comes O
from O
an O
unpublished O
book O
, O
written O
by O
the O
former O
employer O
of O
the O
Emperors B-PER
, O
Salvatore B-PER
Volponi I-PER
. O

Elderly O
, O
voiceless O
, O
Volponi B-PER
was O
summoned O
yesterday O
to O
appear O
in O
court O
. O

" O
I O
know O
Simonetta B-PER
had O
a O
recent O
affair O
with O
a O
man O
, O
" O
said O
the O
witness O
who O
was O
accompanied O
by O
her O
lawyer O
, O
Maria B-PER
Antonietta I-PER
Lamazza I-PER
, O
in O
Piazzale O
Clodio O
. O

To O
make O
Volponi B-PER
's O
version O
more O
plausible O
-- O
which O
in O
the O
book O
" O
I O
, O
Smonetta O
, O
and O
the O
Way O
of O
Poma O
" O
also O
tells O
the O
personal O
story O
of O
a O
man O
who O
was O
destroyed O
by O
it O
-- O
it O
's O
written O
by O
the O
same O
Simonetta B-PER
Cesaroni I-PER
who O
was O
re O
- O
examined O
with O
other O
eyes O
by O
P.M. O
Cavallone B-PER
. O

Some O
versions O
of O
a O
song O
by O
Lucio B-PER
Dalla I-PER
held O
in O
the O
bag O
would O
remind O
you O
of O
a O
particular O
emotional O
situation O
of O
the O
girl O
, O
coming O
out O
of O
a O
long O
love O
story O
and O
about O
starting O
another O
one O
. O

" O
And O
what O
should O
I O
regret O
-- O
Simonetta B-PER
writes O
on O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
found O
in O
the O
bag O
along O
with O
the O
box O
of O
contraceptives O
-- O
that O
I O
'm O
playing O
with O
life O
, O
that O
I O
'm O
taking O
it O
for O
granted O
? O

So O
much O
for O
the O
one O
day O
, O
so O
much O
for O
the O
eternity O
, O
I O
've O
already O
thought O
about O
it O
. O

The O
past O
is O
also O
one O
minute O
, O
every O
kiss O
I O
get O
from O
people O
I O
love O
. O
" O

But O
it O
's O
from O
Dr. O
Dna O
's O
analysis O
of O
the O
bloodstream O
, O
the O
exams O
of O
the O
RCMP B-ORG
officers O
, O
the O
results O
of O
which O
will O
be O
announced O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
month O
, O
that O
the O
breakthrough O
may O
come O
. O

If O
it O
's O
shown O
that O
the O
Dna O
is O
compatible O
with O
Simonetta B-PER
's O
or O
even O
compatible O
with O
a O
third O
person O
's O
Dna O
, O
then O
the O
yellow O
on O
Poma B-LOC
Street I-LOC
might O
approach O
the O
solution O
. O

The O
ethical O
footprint O
was O
found O
in O
the O
washrooms O
in O
the O
second O
floor O
apartment O
building O
on O
Poma B-LOC
2 I-LOC
, O

It O
might O
indicate O
that O
that O
's O
where O
the O
killer O
cleaned O
up O
. O

And O
yet O
he O
escaped O
, O
climbing O
up O
the O
third O
floor O
elevator O
-- O
there O
were O
blood O
stains O
in O
the O
cabin O
as O
well O
-- O
and O
then O
exiting O
from O
a O
door O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
garage O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
he O
knew O
the O
building O
very O
well O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
new O
inquiry O
would O
reveal O
disturbing O
details O
such O
as O
the O
disappearance O
of O
a O
few O
clothes O
on O
the O
body O
, O
a O
crown O
and O
a O
body O
missing O
from O
the O
evidence O
. O

The O
only O
clothes O
that O
covered O
Simonetta B-PER
's O
body O
when O
she O
was O
killed O
with O
29 O
bullets O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
wounds O
, O
the O
bruised O
face O
, O
the O
markings O
of O
a O
gunshot O
wound O
to O
the O
body O
and O
a O
breaststroke O
. O

I O
know O
of O
a O
violent O
approach O
to O
his O
new O
love O
that O
ended O
in O
tragedy O
. O

Probably O
the O
twentysomething O
imagination O
will O
mate O
, O
at O
least O
initially O
, O
with O

has O
to O

even O
more O

Alexander B-PER
came O
back O

with O
a O
great O
sense O

in O
a O
sense O

a O
sense O
of O

He O
could O

turn O
it O
into O
a O

for O
an O
injury O

Now O
he O
's O
touching O
it O

For O
the O
rest O

no O

" O
I O
promise O

going O
to O
change O

for O
three O

I O
've O
been O
beating O

It O
does O

to O
change O
the O

If O
we O
do O

we O

It O

it O

too O
. O

Closing O
these O
first O
10 O
days O
of O
work O
with O
a O
double O
success O
would O
be O
a O
great O
confidence O
injection O

" O

The O
same O
thing O
that O
Lippi B-PER
intends O
to O
give O
to O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
, O
and O
most O
likely O
to O
Gilardino B-PER
. O

" O
According O
to O
many O
people O
's O
philosophy O
-- O
his O
explanation O
-- O
I O
should O
confirm O
the O
11 O
players O
on O
Saturday O
for O
how O
they O
played O
. O

I O
'll O
go O
the O
other O
way O
, O
and O
somebody O
's O
going O
to O
be O
ashamed O
. O

But O
at O
almost O
60 O
years O
old O
and O
35 O
on O
a O
bench O
, O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
think O
that O
if O
a O
young O
person O
has O
given O
so O
much O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
possibilities O
, O
it O
's O
okay O
not O
to O
expect O
too O
much O
from O
them O
. O

It O
took O
courage O
to O
put O
it O
in O
21 O
years O
, O
and O
it O
takes O
acumen O
now O
to O
manage O
its O
future O
. O

And O
if O
another O
young O
person O
has O
experienced O
the O
emotion O
of O
exorcism O
, O
that O
's O
a O
good O
reason O
to O
say O
... O
" O

Translated O
, O
out O
of O
De B-PER
Rossi I-PER
and O
back O
into O
Gilardino B-PER
. O

Two O
opposing O
choices O
, O
but O
one O
philosophy O
. O

" O
I O
ca O
n't O
afford O
to O
have O
only O
eleven O
players O
on O
my O
mind O
. O

Between O
championships O
and O
cups O
, O
the O
players O
in O
the O
big O
clubs O
have O
one O
free O
Wednesday O
. O

Today O
's O
soccer O
is O
harder O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
a O
team O
of O
30 O
players O
, O
but O
20 O
- O
22 O
, O
yes O
. O

And O
also O
for O
the O
form O
. O

the O
basic O
idea O
is O
, O
adaptive O
to O
the O
players O
available O
. O

That O
's O
why O
it O
can O
change O
. O

It O
can O
be O
... O
" O

It O
's O
inevitable O
, O
in O
any O
case O
, O
that O
the O
dim O
lights O
of O
the O
stadium O
in O
Chisinau B-LOC
will O
all O
be O
focused O
on O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
. O

" O
But O
it O
's O
also O
true O
for O
him O
-- O
Lippi B-PER
asks O
-- O
the O
whole O
talk O
. O

The O
samples O
get O
irresponsible O
. O

If O
it O
's O
not O
on O
the O
pedestal O
as O
it O
was O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
it O
's O
good O
for O
Alex B-PER
. O

He O
had O
jumped O
out O
of O
it O
, O
no O
one O
had O
put O
it O
in O
. O

but O
often O
the O
samples O
are O
helped O
to O
come O
up O
, O
so O
then O
it O
's O
more O
pleasurable O
to O
bring O
them O
down O
. O
" O

Lippi B-PER
, O
though O
, O
by O
investing O
in O
the O
mission O
of O
partial O
risk O
, O
does O
n't O
mean O
pushing O
it O
over O
the O
line O

that O
's O
above O
his O
concept O
of O

So O
it O

a O

of O

The O

even O
though O
there O

some O

An O

in O
a O

and O
a O
world O
record O
- O
breaking O
seventh O
time O
in O
a O

, O
are O
two O
good O
reasons O
to O
aspire O
to O
a O
world O
finish O
, O
given O
the O
physical O
conditions O
. O

After O
the O
crash O
, O
he O
did O
n't O
stop O
. O

The O
judge O
orders O
the O
seizure O
of O
the O
document O
. O

Take O
your O
patent O
to O
your O
grandmother O
. O

He O
invested O
in O
a O
pedestrian O
without O
even O
realizing O
it O
. O

Is O
it O
possible O
to O
invest O
a O
person O
in O
a O
city O
, O
fracture O
their O
neck O
with O
cartilage O
, O
cause O
obvious O
damage O
to O
their O
car O
's O
windshield O
and O
not O
notice O
anything O
? O

The O
logic O
says O
it O
's O
improbable O
, O
not O
impossible O
, O
but O
that O
's O
exactly O
what O
would O
have O
happened O
to O
a O
woman O
in O
her O
30s O
, O
now O
an O
80 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
woman O
on O
probation O
for O
failing O
to O
deliver O
. O

Her O
patent O
, O
after O
a O
lawyer O
named O
Bonifacio B-PER
Giudiceandrea I-PER
miraculously O
managed O
to O
get O
her O
back O
the O
document O
she O
had O
been O
denied O
by O
the O
government B-ORG
commissioner I-ORG
, O
has O
now O
been O
seized O
by O
the O
judicial O
authorities O
. O

A O
unique O
rather O
than O
rare O
measure O
, O
hastily O
and O
furiously O
conceived O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
an O
elementary O
consideration O
: O

if O
the O
old O
driver O
's O
reflection O
does O
n't O
allow O
her O
to O
see O
that O
she O
's O
hitting O
someone O
on O
the O
road O
, O
that O
means O
the O
woman O
in O
the O
car O
is O
a O
danger O
to O
herself O
and O
to O
others O
. O

And O
so O
the O
policeman O
Marco B-PER
La I-PER
Ganga I-PER
responded O
to O
the O
request O
of O
the O
policeman O
Giuseppe B-PER
De I-PER
Benedetto I-PER
for O
the O
preliminary O
seizure O
of O
the O
driver O
's O
license O
. O

The O
incident O
happened O
on O
May O
21st O
last O
year O
. O

That O
day O
, O
a O
girl O
who O
was O
taking O
a O
driving O
lesson O
was O
about O
to O
get O
in O
her O
school O
car O
to O
practice O
. O

The O
vehicle O
was O
parked O
on O
a O
runway O
in O
Buonarroti O
near O
the O
crossing O
of O
St. O
Antonio O
via O
Trento B-LOC
. O

Just O
as O
the O
poor O
girl O
was O
opening O
the O
trunk O
of O
her O
car O
, O
a O
six O
- O
wheeler O
sedan O
drove O
past O
, O
and O
it O
smashed O
into O
the O
girl O
's O
head O
and O
threw O
her O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

In O
the O
eyes O
of O
some O
eyewitnesses O
, O
the O
investor O
did O
n't O
stop O
, O
he O
just O
stepped O
in O
. O

While O
the O
girl O
was O
being O
abducted O
and O
taken O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
for O
her O
shoulder O
fracture O
, O
urban O
cops O
were O
trying O
to O
identify O
the O
pirate O
. O

The O
car O
model O
, O
the O
color O
, O
and O
some O
license O
plate O
numbers O
took O
the O
agents O
all O
the O
way O
back O
to O
V.M. B-PER
, O
80 O
years O
in O
the O
' O
30s O
. O

There O
were O
still O
unmistakable O
marks O
of O
the O
crash O
on O
his O
six O
hundred O
. O

The O
woman O
justified O
herself O
by O
saying O
she O
did O
n't O
notice O
anything O
. O

But O
that O
did O
n't O
stop O
an O
administrative O
process O
from O
happening O
, O
which O
led O
to O
the O
suspension O
of O
the O
driver O
's O
license O
by O
the O
Commissioner B-ORG
of I-ORG
Government I-ORG
. O

Against O
this O
decision O
, O
the O
lady O
's O
lawyer O
filed O
a O
lawsuit O
with O
the O
District O
Court O
, O
and O
the O
District O
Court O
upheld O
the O
defendant O
's O
arguments O
and O
granted O
the O
driver O
's O
license O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
prosecution B-ORG
of I-ORG
the O
Republic O
intervened O
, O
and O
they O
opened O
criminal O
proceedings O
against O
him O
for O
failing O
to O
provide O
rescue O
. O

For O
MP O
Giuseppe B-PER
De I-PER
Benedetto I-PER
, O
it O
was O
n't O
difficult O
to O
justify O
the O
precautionary O
request O
: O

if O
she O
really O
did O
n't O
notice O
that O
she O
'd O
sent O
a O
pedestrian O
to O
the O

maybe O
she O
should O
have O
left O
her O
pants O
down O

the O

" O
Yes O
, O
the O
first O
time O
. O

It O
's O
just O
going O
to O
be O
a O
big O
emotion O
. O
" O

Why O
is O
that O
? O

" O
I O
saw O
and O
reviewed O
dad O
's O
cassette O
tapes O
when O
he O
was O
running O
this O
race O
. O

I O
've O
been O
dreaming O
about O
this O
moment O
for O
years O
. O

Again O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
a O
lot O
of O
excitement O
when O
I O
get O
off O
the O
ground O
. O

I O
will O
fight O
with O
my O
heart O
. O
" O

Have O
you O
ever O
seen O
one O
of O
these O
specials O
? O

" O
In O
other O
words O
, O
it O
's O
the O
world O
race O
that O
I O
've O
watched O
most O
of O
all O
. O

Often O
, O
my O
mother O
would O
tell O
me O
stories O
of O
my O
father O
competing O
for O
one O
test O
or O
another O
. O

No O
, O
I O
never O
went O
through O
the O
evidence O
, O
but O
I O
went O
from O
one O
place O
to O
another O
to O
see O
the O
world O
's O
big O
ones O
. O

Last O
year O
I O
was O
at O
the O
inversion O
of O
Colle B-LOC

That O
's O
fantastic O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
be O
there O
this O
year O
. O
" O

I O
've O
been O
away O
for O
three O
months O
. O

Is O
it O
hard O
to O
recover O
? O

" O
It O
was O
an O
unprecedented O
season O
. O

To O
maintain O
a O
good O
rhythm O
, O
you O
'd O
have O
to O
keep O
running O
. O

It O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O

each O
other O

This O

where O
it O
all O
starts O

" O

What O
's O
your O
goal O
? O

" O
Everybody O
remembers O
the O
last O
race O

So O
it O
's O
imperative O
that O
we O
do O
our O
best O
. O
" O

Mount O

Have O
you O

" O
No O

But O
I O
'm O
not O

I O
like O

Take O
the O

it O

it O

I O

young O

I O
need O

learn O

Unfortunately O

that O

not O
how O
the O

Now O
we O

Never O
, O
perhaps O
, O
as O
in O

-- O
Bezzi B-PER

has O
the O
dark O
side O
of O
cruelty O
emerged O
that O
sometimes O
human O
beings O
are O
capable O
of O
, O
and O
the O
memory O
goes O
back O
to O
the O
great O
tragedies O
of O
the O
20th O
century O
, O
to O
the O
mix O
of O
Nazism O
and O
Stalinism O
, O
with O
the O
exuberance O
of O
entire O
populations O

" O

" O
The O
condemnation O
of O
these O
atrocities O
and O
the O
mobilization O
of O
everyone O
against O
this O
blind O

brutal O
terrorism O
that O
eradicates O
every O
boundary O
and O
eradicates O
the O
most O

-- O
Bezzi B-PER

-- O
must O
go O
hand O
in O
hand O
with O
concrete O
initiatives O
of O
solidarity O
with O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
unfortunate O
city O
of O
Ossetia B-LOC
. O

The O
traditional O
, O
extraordinary O
sensitivity O
of O
the O
' O
30s O
was O
already O
expressed O
in O
the O
early O
hours O
of O
the O
tragedy O
, O
with O
initiatives O
being O
launched O
to O
express O
the O
outrage O
and O
horror O
over O
Beslan B-LOC
's O
actions O
. O

But O
now O
I O
think O
the O
time O
has O
come O
to O
organize O
and O
systematically O
address O
the O
common O
sentiments O
of O
the O
' O
30s O
that O
want O
to O
give O
a O
tangible O
testimony O
of O
their O
closeness O
to O
that O
fateful O
population O
. O

Why O
, O
then O
-- O
asks O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
provincial B-ORG

-- O
why O
do O
n't O

start O

next O
week O

October O
5th O

realistically O
it O

going O
to O
be O
at O
the O
8th O

and O
maybe O
at O
the O
next O
meeting O

it O

going O

the O
discussion O

approval O
phase O

by O
the O
middle O
of O
next O
month O
, O
the O
iteration O
of O
the O
first O
adoption O
should O
be O
completed O

There O
's O
going O
to O
be O
another O
60 O
days O
of O
observation O
, O
and O
then O
we O
're O
going O
to O
go O
back O
to O
class O
for O
final O
approval O
. O

And O
then O
, O
in O
order O
for O
the O
interventions O
that O
are O
included O
in O
the O
variant O
to O
actually O
be O
implemented O

it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG

which O
has O
a O
year O
to O
read O
all O
the O
documentation O
. O

The O
removal O
of O
the O
need O
for O
separate O
deliberations O
will O
allow O
us O
to O
avoid O
the O
madness O
of O
the O
mega O

amendment O
that O
-- O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
a O
number O
of O
advisers O
-- O
would O
have O
been O
necessary O
to O
reconsider O
all O
the O
outstanding O
questions O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
amendments O
were O
concerned O
, O
the O
group O
leaders O
gave O
a O
date O
-- O
September O
29th O
-- O
as O
the O
deadline O
for O
submitting O
amendments O
to O
the O
deliberations O
. O

In O
theory O
, O
no O
rule O
imposes O
an O
ultimatum O
for O
their O
deposition O
, O
but O
the O
group O
leaders O
signed O
this O
kind O
of O
gentlemen O
's O
agreement O
to O
allow O
the O
offices O
to O
go O
through O
a O
quick O
, O
step O
- O
by O
- O
step O
instructional O
process O
on O
any O
new O
questions O
that O
might O
be O
raised O
in O
the O
amendments O
. O

And O
then O
on O
September O
30th O
, O
the O
city B-ORG
council I-ORG
will O
come O
back O
together O
to O
discuss O
those O
very O
changes O

Unless O

by O
that O
time O
, O
the O
thorny O
issues O
of O
sub O

in O

After O
decades O
of O
viewing O
television O
as O
a O
factor O
of O
homogenization O
and O
globalization O
, O
are O
we O
faced O
with O
a O
rediscovery O
of O
a O
" O
local O
" O
dimension O
of O
communication O
? O

The O
roundtable O
started O
with O
the O
communication O
of O
Massimo B-PER
Arvat I-PER
, O
who O
brought O
his O
experience O
as O
a O
community O
television O
producer O
to O
Piedmont B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
the O
local O
communities O
were O
able O
to O
create O
a O
grassroots O
network O
-- O
first O
with O
ordinary O
citizens O
, O
then O
with O
environmental O
groups O
, O
and O
then O
a O
diverse O
group O
of O
voluntary O
groups O
and O
associations O
-- O
and O
that O
gave O
rise O
to O
a O
daily O
half O
- O
hour O
program O
that O
was O
also O
broadcast O
on O
provincial O
television O
. O

The O
model O
was O
to O
put O
it O
into O
a O
talk O
show O
that O
dealt O
with O
land O
- O
based O
issues O
and O
was O
done O
in O
a O
public O
place O
. O

" O
Television O
, O
" O
the O
producer O
said O
, O
" O
is O
a O
tool O
that O
has O
to O
be O
used O
primarily O
to O
communicate O

from O
his O
exorcism O
that O
saw O
him O
as O
the O
master O
of O
mass O
communication O
, O
to O
the O
attempts O
of O
the O
' O
70s O
to O
decentralize O
-- O
with O
the O
birth O

then O
the O
death O
of O

to O
the O
scenarios O

that O

no O

will O
still O
be O

The O
trend O
will O
then O
be O
to O
have O
a O

with O
a O
universal O
coverage O
that O
lives O
by O

than O
the O
Nazis O
did O
. O

What O
they O
were O
led O
to O
think O
was O
that O
evil O
was O
somehow O
necessary O
to O
the O
world O
and O
to O
man O
, O
" O
writes O
the O
pope O

noting O
that O
" O
in O
certain O
concrete O
situations O

human O
existence O
evil O
is O
to O
some O
extent O
useful O
in O
so O
far O
as O
it O
creates O
opportunities O
for O
good O

" O

And O
then O
, O
to O
quote O
Goethe B-PER

Faust O
, O
the O
Holy O
Father O
reminds O
us O
that O
the O
devil O
can O
also O
be O
defined O
as O
" O
a O
part O
of O
that O
force O
which O
always O
wants O
evil O
but O
always O
does O
good O
. O
" O

As O
for O
Nazism O
, O
the O
Holy O
Father O
points O
out O
that O
at O
that O
time O
, O
" O
the O
real O
extent O
of O
the O
evil O
that O
was O
going O
on O
in O
Europe B-LOC
was O
not O
felt O
by O
all O
, O
not O
even O
by O
those O
like O
us O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
that O
whirlpool O
, O
" O
admitting O
that O
" O
for O
a O
long O
time O
the O
West O
did O
not O
want O
to O
believe O
in O
the O
extermination O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
Poland B-LOC
knew O
everything O
about O
what O
the O
Nazis O
did O
and O
did O
to O
the O
Poles O
. O
" O

And O
it O

going O

to O
the O
23rd O
, O
people O

Family O
physicians O
: O

The O
real O
news O
this O
year O
is O
that O
vaccination O
can O
also O
be O
done O
by O
a O
family O
doctor O
. O

" O
It O
starts O
with O
some O
doctors O
who O
have O
made O
it O
available O
, O
" O
says O
Fabio B-PER
Branz I-PER
, O
president O
of O
the O
Order B-ORG
of I-ORG
Doctors I-ORG
, O
" O
but O
by O
next O
year O
, O
this O
outreach O
work O
of O
vaccinating O
the O
caregivers O
will O
be O
routine O
. O
" O

Family O
doctors O
had O
hitherto O
ensured O
immunization O
at O
home O
for O
patients O
who O
could O
n't O
move O
. O

with O
the O
new O
agreements O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
try O
to O
make O
vaccination O
for O
people O
at O
risk O
one O
of O
the O
therapies O
that O
the O
family O
doctors O
do O
on O
a O
regular O
basis O
. O

So O
it O
's O
hoped O
that O
this O
would O
give O
further O
impetus O
to O
the O
vaccination O
effort O
. O

the O
patient O
relying O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
their O
physician O
will O
certainly O
have O
easier O
, O
but O
also O
more O
comfortable O
, O
access O
. O

Since O
1996 O
, O
the O
number O
of O
people O
over O
65 O
who O
have O
been O
vaccinated O
against O
influenza O
has O
doubled O
, O
from O
32,286 O
to O
63,360 O
in O
2003 O
. O

But O
there O
are O
also O
10,000 O
to O
30,000 O
people O
who O
, O
even O
though O
they O
're O
not O
considered O
at O
risk O
, O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
know O
they O
're O
getting O
the O
flu O
, O
and O
they O
buy O
the O
vaccine O
in O
the O
pharmacy O
. O

INFORMATION O
: O

It O
relies O
on O
1,500 O
benches O
and O
70,000 O

TRENTO B-LOC
-- O
In O
the O
team O
that O
's O
training O
under O
Silvano B-PER
Prandi I-PER
, O
there O
's O
also O
an O
invisible O
player O
, O
physically O
in O
the O
gym O
with O
his O
classmates O
, O
routinely O
scouting O
for O
the O
Trentino B-ORG
Volley I-ORG
, O
with O
a O
contract O
that O
's O
valid O
for O
another O
season O
, O
but O
that O
actually O
does O
n't O
exist O
. O

In O
the O
sense O
that O
society O
has O
put O
it O
out O
in O
pink O
and O
is O
just O
waiting O
for O
the O
opportunity O
to O
give O
it O
up O
. O

This O
is O
Gianluca B-PER
Nuzzo I-PER
, O
the O
opposite O
who O
until O
five O
years O
ago O
competed O
in O
both O
quality O
and O
quantity O
with O
the O
same O
Italian O
and O
foreign O
roles O
in O
the O
top O
series B-ORG
, O
and O
who O
now O
finds O
himself O
in O
an O
unlikely O
situation O
, O
because O
, O
after O
the O
Itas B-ORG
took O
Slovakia O
's O
Chocholak B-PER
, O
he O
was O
invited O
to O
look O
for O
another O
team O
. O

" O
Yeah O
, O
" O
says O
Gianluca B-PER
, O
" O
but O
a O
training O
that O
's O
my O
delight O
. O

This O
was O
the O
only O
condition O
I O
put O
on O
the O
president O
until O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
summer O
, O
and O
since O
I O
have O
n't O
received O
any O
convincing O
offers O
yet O
, O
I O
'm O
still O
waiting O
. O

With O
Trentino B-ORG
Volley I-ORG
, O
there O
's O
a O
frank O
relationship O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
bump O
into O
it O
when O
Silvano B-PER
told O
me O
about O
the O
choices O
the O
company O
made O
, O
but O
if O
I O
'm O
still O
here O
, O
it O
's O
because O
Forlì B-ORG
and O
Corigliano B-ORG
did O
n't O
seem O
like O
happy O
choices O
to O
me O
. O
" O

Does O
that O
mean O
you O
decided O
not O
to O
go O
to O
A2 B-ORG
? O

" O
No O
, O
it O
just O
means O
that O
my O
goal O
is O
to O
see O
that O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
contract O
with O
Trentino B-ORG
Volley I-ORG
are O
met O
. O

And O
it O
's O
a O
contract O
from O
A1 B-ORG
everywhere O
. O
" O

And O
yet O
Corigliano B-ORG
had O
officially O
announced O
your O
purchase O
. O

It O
seemed O
like O
a O
happy O
choice O
, O
a O
poor O
guy O
coming O
home O
looking O
for O
a O
job O
. O

" O
The O
company O
was O
really O
committed O
to O
communicating O
that O
the O
operation O
was O
going O
well O
. O

I O
had O
told O
the O
president O
right O
from O
the O
start O
that O
even O
if O
he O
found O
an O
agreement O
with O
the O
Treaty O
, O
the O
final O
word O
would O
be O
on O
me O
. O

Coriander B-ORG
is O
a O
neoplasm O
, O
it O
still O
has O
to O
get O
bones O
at O
these O
levels O
. O

If O
I O
have O
to O
go O
down O
to O
A2 B-ORG
, O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
do O
it O
for O
an O
ambitious O
club O
. O
" O

Did O
you O
get O
any O
offers O
from O
abroad O
? O

" O
A O
Japanese O
prosecutor O
came O
forward O
and O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
repeat O
the O
adventure O
with O
a O
team O
from O
that O
country O
. O

I O
immediately O
gave O
up O
, O
but O
then O
nothing O
happened O
because O
every O
club O
had O
already O
chosen O
their O
only O
foreigner O
. O
" O

Did O
n't O
Pinto B-PER
, O
who O
's O
always O
been O
your O
estimator O
, O
ask O
you O
to O
come O
back O
to O
Taranto B-ORG
? O

Three O
seasons O
ago O
, O
the O
experience O
was O
great O
. O

You O
fell O
out O
of O
your O
pants O
very O
well O
, O
and O
Trento B-LOC
actually O
awarded O
you O
the O
MVP O
. O

" O
It O
's O
true O
, O
that O
was O
the O
best O
season O
I O
've O
played O
since O
the O
injury O
. O

But O
after O
that O
championship O
, O
the O
company O
failed O
, O
and O
we O
lost O
almost O
all O
of O
our O
monthly O
allowances O
-- O

They O
have O
a O
good O
team O
today O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
resources O
to O
invest O
even O
on O
the O
bench O
. O
" O

Let O
's O
go O
all O
the O
way O
back O
to O
last O
season O
. O

Trent B-LOC
looked O
like O
the O
right O
place O
to O
go O
back O
to O
play O
the O
opposite O
game O
without O
too O
much O
pressure O
. O

What O
happened O
instead O
? O

" O
Well O
, O
after O
losing O
my O
shoulder O
injury O
that O
kept O
me O
still O
for O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
, O
I O
actually O
played O
very O
little O
. O

It O
's O
punishing O
to O
keep O
on O
the O
bench O
, O
because O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
habit O
of O
playing O
with O
your O
peers O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
certain O
automation O
, O
on O
the O
field O
, O
then O
you O
're O
scared O
. O

In O
the O
playoffs O
, O
too O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
in O
a O
half O
- O
reinvented O
, O
almost O
never O
crashed O
seat O
. O

It O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
do O
more O
. O

The O
difference O
between O
us O
and O
Peru B-ORG
was O
all O
there O
, O
they O
were O
a O
team O
we O
were O
n't O
. O
" O

So O
what O
happens O
now O
? O

" O
I O
'm O
training O
with O
the O
kids O
. O

I O
put O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
into O
it O
because O
I O
know O
it O
's O
for O
me O
and O
it O
's O
for O
them O
. O

I O
realize O
that O
the O
Trentino B-ORG
Volley I-ORG
is O
making O
an O
economic O
sacrifice O
, O
because O
it O
actually O
has O
an O
extra O

on O
board O

but O
when O
it O
reopens O
the O
market O
-- O
after O
three O
a O
day O
-- O
I O
realize O
that O
there O
's O
a O
new O
system O

my O
situation O

all O

have O
to O
do O

who O

is O
a O
very O
talented O
young O
man O
who O
spends O
every O
night O
in O
houses O
that O
are O
temporarily O
vacant O

even O
for O
a O
few O
days O
on O
a O

from O

In O

he O
repairs O

he O
fills O

fantasy O

In O
this O
pilgrimage O
, O
she O
enters O
a O
ladies O

house O
where O
there O
is O
an O
unhappy O
woman O
, O
her O
face O
marked O
by O
her O

Almost O
a O
generous O
fool O
makes O
her O
feel O
different O
, O
respected O
and O
loved O
. O

She O
decides O
to O
follow O
him O
on O
his O
visits O
to O
outbreaks O
that O
often O
include O
loneliness O

incomprehension O

out O

he O
ends O
up O
in O

But O
the O

be O
physically O
present O
without O
being O
seen O
, O
if O
not O
by O
the O

he O
's O
in O

Maybe O
happiness O

or O
, O
less O
ambitiously O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
face O
life O
with O
serenity O
implies O
really O
imposing O
what O
we O

around O
us O

not O

animating O
it O

It O
's O
an O
extraordinary O
and O
fascinating O
work O
that O
the O
filmmaker O
was O
able O
to O
effectively O
put O
into O

by O
connecting O
it O
with O
some O
of O

another O
war O

the O
Fourth O

that O

points O
out O
the O
role O
that O
Onu B-ORG

" O
The O
Pope O

repeatedly O
reminded O
us O
that O
the O

provides O
all O

confront O

the O

for O

to O
see O
how O

But O
I O
think O
we O
need O

go O
beyond O

members O

The O

address O

Why O
not O
an O

" O

Martino B-PER
rejects O
the O
idea O
that O
there O
is O
a O

" O
There O
is O
a O

those O

the O

're O
doing O
entry O
right O
now O
, O
alongside O
the O
experimental O
admissions O
nurses O
. O

" O
When O
they O
're O
14 O
, O
they O
should O
already O
be O
self O
- O
reliant O
in O
order O
to O
do O
their O
clerical O
work O
-- O
says O
mayor O
Pierluigi B-PER
Torboli I-PER
-- O
so O
that O
nurses O
in O
the O
triage O
can O
do O
their O
clerical O
work O
more O
broadly O
. O
" O

The O
hostesses O
will O
only O
be O
able O
to O
do O
administrative O
acceptance O
, O
which O
is O
to O
collect O
the O
patient O
's O
analytics O
and O
compile O
an O
acceptance O
card O
, O
with O
the O
modalities O
of O
arrival O
, O
the O
place O
of O
origin O
, O
the O
type O
of O
accident O
. O

" O
Of O
course O
, O
it O
excludes O
the O
red O
codes O
that O
come O
directly O
into O
the O
emergency O
room O
and O
also O
other O
patients O
who O
have O
particular O
symptoms O
-- O
chest O
pain O
, O
nausea O
, O
difficulty O
breathing O
-- O
or O
who O
come O
into O
the O
cage O
and O
immediately O
go O
to O
the O
triage O
-- O
continue O
Torboli B-PER
-- O

But O
everybody O
else O
does O
administrative O
acceptance O
first O
. O
" O

In O
this O
first O
phase O
, O
the O
acceptance O
hostesses O
will O
be O
sacrificed O
in O
the O
space O
now O
reserved O
for O
the O
harbormasters O
. O

" O
The O
big O
problem O
we O
have O
is O
space O
, O
" O
Torboli B-PER
says O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
until O
there O
is O
a O
complete O
overhaul O
of O
the O
emergency O
room O
, O
within O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
, O
there O
is O
no O
solution O
. O

It O
's O
going O
to O
be O
something O
else O
after O
that O
. O
" O

Meanwhile O
, O
efforts O
are O
being O
made O
to O
rationalize O
access O
, O
including O
by O
agreeing O
new O
procedures O
with O
the O
first O
responder O
at O
118 B-ORG
for O
patients O
arriving O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
administration O
is O
concerned O
, O
the O
entrustment O
of O
this O
activity O
to O
the O
hostesses O
met O
with O
a O
request O
from O
the O
nurses O
themselves O
, O
and O
that O
was O
met O
with O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
director O
of O
the O
Baldantoni B-PER
hospital O
. O

" O
The O
big O
result O
that O
we O
think O
we O
're O
going O
to O
get O
is O
more O
time O
for O
triage O
nurses O
to O
take O
care O
of O
patients O
who O
are O
waiting O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
" O
Torboli B-PER
concludes O
. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
anticipate O
some O
procedures O
and O
patient O
incoming O
times O
. O

The O
outcome O
will O
surely O
be O
good O
, O
both O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
nurse O
's O
work O
and O
for O
the O
patient O
, O
who O
will O
be O
able O
to O
be O
monitored O
again O
and O
see O
improvements O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
their O
care O
while O
they O
're O
waiting O
. O
" O

A O
further O
step O
will O
be O
the O
assignment O
of O
some O

to O
follow O
people O

Yesterday O
afternoon O
, O
there O
was O
a O
space O
for O
the O
protagonists O
, O
for O
those O
who O

hand O
experience O
mental O
illness O
. O

This O
year O
also O
, O
Ron B-PER
Coleman I-PER
came O
in O
, O
and O
he O
wrote O
a O
book O
called O
" O
Escape O
from O
Mental O
Injury O
" O
and O
a O
manual O
for O
voice O
- O
hearers O
. O

He O
, O
too O
, O
was O
a O
patient O
, O
and O
he O
shared O
his O
experience O
of O
being O
left O
essentially O
to O
himself O
and O
his O
medications O
. O

Coleman B-PER
emphasized O
that O
in O
order O
to O
be O
better O
, O
the O
patient O
needs O
to O
talk O
, O
needs O
to O
be O
heard O
, O
needs O
to O
find O
a O
careful O
interlocutor O
who O
has O
the O
patience O
to O
pay O
attention O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
patients O
were O
there O
who O
wanted O
to O
take O
their O
experience O
and O
share O
it O
with O
others O
. O

Their O
stories O
told O
us O
that O
there O
was O
a O
deep O
discomfort O
initially O
, O
and O
not O
always O
, O
and O
many O
of O
them O
claimed O
to O
have O
been O
treated O
for O
over O
two O
decades O
without O
any O
improvement O
whatsoever O
. O

Everybody O
agreed O
that O
they O
had O
found O
a O
new O
way O
to O
" O
fight O
" O
and O
to O
feel O
like O
real O
people O
through O
the O
help O
of O

Patients O
with O
severe O
personality O
disorders O
and O
schizophrenia O
-- O
he O
said O
-- O
are O
on O
the O
rise O
, O
perhaps O
because O
our O
societies O
are O
becoming O
more O
individualistic O
and O
there O
's O
never O
time O
to O
listen O
to O
someone O
. O

Sadly O
, O
only O
33 O
percent O
of O
the O
cases O
can O
be O
cured O
. O

I O
think O
working O
with O
patients O
like O
this O
is O
important O
to O
listen O
and O
to O
try O
to O
empathize O
with O
them O
, O
with O
their O
problems O
. O
" O

Today O
, O
we O

to O
the O
European O

. O

" O
But O
it O
's O
a O
qualified O
yes O
, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
set O
of O
conditions O
for O
monitoring O

verifying O
the O
situation O
in O
Turkey B-LOC

specific O
recommendations O
on O
how O
to O
conduct O
negotiations O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Brussels B-LOC
is O
proposing O
to O
open O
the O
doors O
slowly O
so O
that O
we O
can O
look O
closely O
at O
who O

take O
the O
time O
to O
turn O

The O
Dutch O
Foreign O
Minister O
Ben B-PER
Bot I-PER
, O
who O
is O
running O
the O
Council B-ORG
, O
said O
the O
talks O
could O
only O
start O
in O
the O
second O
half O
of O
2005 O
. O

The O
outcome O
wo O
n't O
be O
inevitable O
. O

" O
The O
result O
is O
not O
guaranteed O
in O
advance O
, O
" O
Prodi B-PER
explained O
. O

Indeed O
, O
negotiations O
, O
which O
should O
last O
many O
years O
, O
could O
be O
blocked O
or O
suspended O
by O
a O
qualified O
majority O
decision O
of O
the O
Member O

in O
the O
face O
of O

accompanying O
the O
invitation O
to O
the O
European O
leaders O
, O
who O
will O
meet O
on O
December O
17 O
to O
make O
the O
final O
decision O
, O
are O
justified O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
despite O
the O
undeniable O
progress O
that O
has O
been O
made O
-- O
Prodi B-PER
told O
parliamentarians O
first O
, O
and O
then O
the O
press O
-- O
" O
there O
is O
still O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go O
, O
" O
particularly O
as O
regards O
torture O
, O
women O
's O
rights O
and O
trade O
union O
rights O
, O
religious O
freedom O
, O
civil O
- O

relations O
. O

Prodi B-PER
talked O
about O
the O
" O
shadow O
areas O
" O
that O
need O
to O
be O
cleared O
, O
and O
he O
defined O
the O
conditions O
as O
" O
obvious O
precautions O
to O
prevent O
Turkey B-LOC
's O
integration O
from O
jeopardizing O
the O
building O
that O
we O
've O
been O
doing O
for O
over O
50 O
years O
. O
" O

Among O
the O
precautions O
is O
the O
request O
not O
to O
include O
Turkey B-LOC
in O
the O
2007 O
- O
2013 O
financial O
perspective O
, O
but O
to O
start O
accession O
negotiations O
on O
the O
chapters O
with O
financial O
implications O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
next O
financial O
perspective O
. O

That O
means O
, O
in O
the O
most O
optimistic O
version O
, O
Turkey B-LOC
will O
not O
enter O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
until O
2014 O
. O

And O
among O
the O
precautions O
is O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O
permanent O
safeguard O
clause O
to O
control O
the O
flow O
of O
workers O
and O
immigrants O
from O
Turkey B-LOC
, O
a O
country O
predominantly O
Islamic O
but O
extremely O
secular O
in O
its O
institutions O
. O

The O
government O
comes O
out O
of O
Ankara B-LOC
, O
even O
though O
it O
recognizes O
that O
this O
is O
just O
the O
beginning O
of O

what O
a O
mystery O

Who O
killed O
Ozzie B-PER
? O

Who O
was O
the O
man O
from O
the O
ice O
? O

Was O
he O
a O
tribal O
leader O
, O
a O
shaman O
or O
a O
shepherd O
? O

A O
yellow O
that O
's O
over O
5,000 O
years O
old O
, O
which O
was O
the O
theme O
of O
the O
retrospective O
" O
Discover O

, O
" O
for O
the O
Roveretto B-LOC
Archaeological O
Cinema O

After O
the O
screening O
of O
Brando B-PER
Quilici I-PER
's O
film O
" O
The O
Man O
From O
the O
Ice O
, O
" O
a O
debate O
broke O
out O
with O
archaeologist O
Umberto B-PER
Tecchiati I-PER
of O
the O
Office O
of O
Archaeological B-ORG
Surveys I-ORG
in O
Bolzano B-LOC
. O

According O
to O
medical O
reports O
, O
the O
man O
on O
the O
ice O
was O
definitely O
killed O
by O
a O
arrow O
that O
hit O
him O
in O
the O
back O
. O

But O
who O
was O
it O
? O

Certainly O
-- O
the O
expert O
said O
-- O
he O
was O
a O
senior O
man O
. O

he O
was O
carrying O
a O
high O
- O
class O
object O
, O
a O
steel O
axle O
. O

He O
was O
holding O
a O
knife O
in O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
his O
body O
was O
showing O
signs O
of O
collapse O
. O

The O
most O
recent O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
a O
shepherd O
was O
murdered O
for O
his O
clergy O
. O

" O
But O
if O
that O
's O
the O
case O
-- O
Tecchiati B-PER
explained O
-- O
why O
did O
n't O
they O
steal O
his O
ax O
, O
an O
object O
of O
enormous O
value O
at O
the O
time O
? O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
" O

Another O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
a O
shaman O
, O
a O
religious O
man O
, O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
himself O
for O
his O
people O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
explain O
, O
even O
in O
this O
case O
, O
the O
weapons O
he O
was O
given O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
death O
and O
the O
blow O
to O
his O
back O
. O

According O
to O
Tecchiati B-PER
, O
he O
was O
certainly O
a O
high O
- O
ranking O
man O
, O
a O
survivor O
, O
because O
at O
a O
time O
when O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
reach O
the O
age O
of O
thirty O
, O
Oetzi B-PER
was O
killed O
when O
he O
was O
over O
40 O
. O

Poor O
articular O
bone O
marrow O
is O
a O
life O
without O
physical O
stress O
, O
so O
it O
excludes O
the O
shepherd O
's O
hypothesis O
. O

Ötzi B-PER
's O
mystery O
continues O
to O
fascinate O
researchers O
, O
and O
it O
's O
meant O
to O
keep O

gave O
him O
a O

It O
happened O
in O
the O
pediatric O
oncology O
division O
at O
the O
San O
Matteo O
Policlinic O
in O
Pavia B-LOC
, O
and O
in O
a O
way O
that O
has O
all O
the O
characteristics O
of O
a O
scientific O
enterprise O
, O
because O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
the O
cells O
that O
were O
infected O
with O
it O
were O
, O
in O
part O

manipulated O
in O

and O
proliferated O
, O
at O
the O
Cell O
Factory O
at O
the O
Milan B-LOC
Policlinic O
. O

This O
is O
an O
event O
that O
has O
been O
called O
" O
historic O
" O
by O
the O
Minister O
of O
Health O
, O
Girolamo B-PER
Sirchia I-PER
, O
because O
it O
opens O
the O
door O
to O
the O
study O
of O
the O
clinical O
use O
, O
even O
in O
adults O
, O
of O
treated O
stem O
cells O
, O
increasing O
the O
number O
of O
them O
, O
to O
get O
more O
certainty O
about O
aging O
. O

But O
let O
's O
recap O
the O
story O
. O

Professor O
Franco B-PER
Locatelli I-PER
, O
director O
of O
the O
division O
, O
last O
November O
received O
a O
couple O
of O
parents O
in O
his O
study O
. O

They O
're O
born O
in O
a O
community O
in O
Lombardy B-LOC
, O
they O
're O
healthy O
carriers O
of O
Talassemia O
Mayor O
, O
and O
their O
baby O
, O
Luca B-PER
, O
five O
years O
old O
, O
is O
talassemic O
. O

But O
the O
parents O
, O
knowing O
that O
they O
had O
a O
three O
in O
four O
chance O
that O
their O
next O
child O
would O
be O
healthy O
, O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
go O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
she O
's O
four O
months O
pregnant O
. O

He O
's O
waiting O
for O
two O
perfectly O
healthy O
, O
fierce O
twins O
. O

The O
couple O
's O
question O
-- O
and O
this O
was O
clearly O
addressed O
to O
Pavia B-LOC
by O
a O
well O
- O
informed O
family O
physician O
-- O
is O
full O
of O
hope O
. O

Can O
the O
twins O
that O
are O
about O
to O
be O
born O
help O
their O
siblings O
? O

Locators B-PER
know O
this O
very O
well O
. O

because O
they O
're O
healthy O
and O
compatible O
with O
little O
Luca B-PER
, O
the O
twins O
can O
be O
used O
for O
stem O
cell O
transplants O
. O

They O
're O
born O
in O
April O
at O
the O
St. O
Matthew O
's O
Obstetric O
and O
Gynecological O
Clinic O
, O
and O
at O
the O
time O
of O
birth O
, O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
two O
cochlear O
implants O
is O
frozen O
and O
taken O
away O
. O

But O
the O
first O
test O
shows O
that O
one O
is O
rich O
in O
stem O
cells O
, O
the O
other O
is O
poor O
in O
stem O
cells O
. O

For O
Locatelli B-PER
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
opportunity O
not O
only O
to O
do O
a O
stem O
- O
rich O
unit O
transplant O
, O
but O
also O
to O
use O
the O
other O
one O
, O
which O
is O
equally O
compatible O
, O
after O
we O
amplify O
the O
number O
of O
stem O
cells O
. O

" O
In O
this O
way O
, O
" O
the O
pathologist O
said O
, O
" O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
verify O
, O
through O
appropriate O
molecular O
examinations O
, O
the O
contribution O
of O
both O
the O
placental O
circuitry O
, O
the O
one O
that O
's O
rich O
in O
stem O
cells O
, O
and O
also O
the O
one O
that O
's O
poorer O
, O
whose O
stem O
cells O
have O
grown O
in O
vitro O
. O
" O

And O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
it O
's O
been O
shown O
that O
even O
expanded O
in O
vitro O
units O
can O
contribute O
to O
the O
attachment O
of O
stem O
cells O
, O
" O
and O
then O
diversified O
to O
form O
healthy O
red O
blood O
cells O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
double O
transplant O
, O
which O
took O
place O
on O
August O
12th O
, O
after O
the O
number O
of O
stem O
cells O
from O
the O
poorest O
cordon O
had O
been O
grown O
60 O
times O
in O

for O
outcome O
: O

Already O
16 O
days O
after O
the O
surgery O
, O
Luca B-PER
had O
white O
blood O
cells O
that O
were O
largely O
protective O
against O
infection O
-- O
high O
in O
these O
cases O
-- O
and O
two O
days O
later O
, O
the O
first O
signs O
of O
a O

were O

contract O
of O
the O
CEO O
of O
the O
Healthcare B-ORG
Company I-ORG
, O
there O
was O
a O
controversy O
over O
whether O
or O
not O
Carlo B-PER
Favaretti I-PER
, O
who O
was O
appointed O
by O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
five O
years O
ago O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
selection O
process O
, O
should O
be O
re O
- O
elected O
. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
have O
an O
intervention O
today O
from O
Daniele B-PER
Orrico I-PER
, O
Chief O
Neurology B-ORG
at O
S. O
Chiara O
Hospital O
in O
Trento B-LOC
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
discussion O
that O
's O
going O
on O
in O
your O
newspaper O
these O
days O
about O
whether O
or O
not O
to O
confirm O
the O
current O
CEO O
of O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Health I-ORG
Agency I-ORG
. O

I O
live O
in O
Trento B-LOC
, O
and O
I O
work O
at O
the O
Sanitation B-ORG
Company I-ORG
. O

As O
a O
trainee O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
the O
best O
services O
from O
the O
best O
health O
professionals O
available O
24 O
hours O
a O
day O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
these O
services O
to O
be O
available O
, O
both O
for O
emergencies O
and O
for O
scheduled O
interventions O
, O
at O
times O
that O
I O
think O
are O
appropriate O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
the O
best O
possible O
availability O
of O
enthusiasm O
and O
time O
for O
all O
healthcare O
workers O
. O

food O
and O
logistics O
should O
be O
not O
only O
something O
that O
I O
like O
but O
something O
that O
allows O
me O
to O
choose O
between O
options O
. O

All O
of O
this O
, O
I O
would O
say O
, O
costs O
the O
community O
less O
than O
we O
currently O
spend O
on O
health O
care O
. O

As O
an O
employee O
of O
the O
company B-ORG
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
be O
recognized O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
merit O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
economic O
gratification O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
career O
progression O
, O
the O
dedication O
I O
have O
shown O
throughout O
my O
career O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
be O
able O
to O
decide O
which O
collaborators O
are O
around O
me O
, O
which O
equipment O
to O
buy O
, O
which O
amount O
of O
work O
to O
do O
and O
which O
to O
leave O
, O
when O
to O
go O
on O
vacation O
and O
which O
refresher O
courses O
to O
take O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
nothing O
to O
be O
decided O
without O
first O
consulting O
me O
, O
and O
I O
'd O
like O
the O
workplace O
a O
few O
minutes O
away O
from O
my O
home O
. O

That O
's O
all O
it O
takes O
, O
of O
course O
, O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
provocation O
to O
get O
to O
the O
nub O
of O
the O
issue O
raised O
above O
about O
the O
Directorate B-ORG
- I-ORG
General I-ORG
of O
the O
company B-ORG
. O

Can O
anybody O
really O
believe O
that O
all O
of O
this O
stuff O
that O
I O
've O
shown O
you O
is O
doable O
or O
not O
depending O
on O
the O
characteristics O
and O
the O
propensities O
of O
the O
CEO O
? O

It O
's O
obvious O
, O
leaving O
the O
agencies O
out O
, O
that O
the O
Director O
General O
of O
Provincial O
Health O
can O
influence O
many O
of O
these O
aspects O
, O
both O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
user O
and O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
citizen O
who O
depends O
on O
the O
health O
services O
, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
bring O
to O
the O
discussion O
the O
conviction O
that O
the O
person O
running O
the O
health B-ORG
service I-ORG
company I-ORG
has O
to O
follow O
the O
instructions O
of O
the O
person O
who O
, O
by O
his O
or O
her O
institutional O
mandate O
, O
has O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
health B-ORG
service I-ORG
as O
a O
whole O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
the O
policy O
. O

The O
politician O
has O
to O
tell O
the O
CEO O
what O
's O
the O
road O
to O
go O
, O
and O
he O
has O
to O
put O
in O
place O
checks O
that O
allow O
him O
to O
have O
feedback O
to O
correct O
any O
deviations O
from O
the O
program O
. O

The O
operational O
part O
of O
the O
Department O
is O
led O
by O
the O
political O
part O
, O
which O
has O
the O
delicate O
task O
of O
making O
compatible O
the O
various O
, O
sometimes O
conflicting O
, O
demands O
of O
citizens O
on O
public O
health O
. O

Politicians O
have O
to O
listen O
to O
everybody O
, O
but O
then O
it O
's O
fatal O
that O
they O
have O
to O
make O
decisions O
that O
do O
n't O
satisfy O
everybody O
. O

The O
mandate O
has O
to O
be O
clear O
, O
and O
the O
tools O
for O
measuring O
outcomes O
have O
to O
be O
equally O
clear O
. O

It O
's O
unthinkable O
for O
the O
Director O
- O
General O
's O
job O
to O
be O
evaluated O
just O
before O
the O
end O
of O
his O
mandate O
. O

The O
policy O
should O
have O
a O
consistent O
return O
on O
what O
's O
happening O
in O
the O
health B-ORG
care I-ORG
business I-ORG
, O
both O
by O
the O
people O
who O
produce O
it O
and O
by O
the O
people O
who O
consume O
it O
. O

As O
for O
the O
CEO O
's O
collaborators O
, O
it O
's O
obvious O
that O
priority O
positions O
are O
being O
rejected O
by O
people O
who O
believe O
that O
only O
outside O
of O
Trinidad B-LOC
can O
you O
find O
leaders O
of O
a O
certain O
professional O
background O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
notion O
of O
the O
promotion O
of O
" O
twentysomething O
" O
as O
a O
measure O
of O
merit O
is O
being O
challenged O
. O

Again O
, O
it O
's O
the O
political O
, O
legislative O
machinery O
that O
makes O
sure O
that O
the O
Director O
- O
General O
has O
trusted O
collaborators O
around O
him O
, O
and O
so O
it O
makes O
sure O
that O
the O
choices O
are O
made O
according O
to O
certain O
criteria O
. O

So O
the O
policy O
has O
to O
give O
precise O
guidelines O
and O
monitor O
their O
implementation O
, O
looking O
for O
the O
corrections O
to O
those O
dysfunctions O
that O
10 O
years O
of O
corporate O
healthcare O
has O
highlighted O
. O

This O
is O
an O
unfinished O
process O
, O
with O
both O
general O
and O
local O
aspects O
( O
the O
role O
of O
hospitals O
, O
integration O
with O
each O
other O
and O
with O
the O
territory O
, O
representativeness O
of O
workers O
, O
verification O
of O
directorate B-ORG
- I-ORG
general I-ORG
operations O
, O
just O
to O
name O
a O
few O
) O
still O
awaiting O
a O
solution O
. O

It O
's O
an O
illusion O
to O
think O
that O
the O
dismissal O
of O
the O
current O
CEO O
represents O
the O
magic O
solution O
to O
health O
care O
problems O
. O

In O
order O
to O
govern O
an O
enormous O
machine O
like O
the O
Thirty O
Years O
' O
Healthcare O
, O
you O
also O
need O
to O
know O
its O
various O
aspects O
, O
and O
the O
ongoing O
revolution O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
leadership O
is O
not O
going O
in O
this O
direction O
. O

We O
reappropriate O
politics O
for O
its O
leadership O
role O
, O
and O
we O
give O
ourselves O
participatory O
and O
verifiable O
tools O
that O
are O
shared O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
but O
public O
and O
transparent O
to O
all O

blue O
, O
so O
he O
's O
calling O
for O
a O
correct O
coordinate O
. O

and O
a O
pair O
of O
handkerchiefs O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
scissors O
. O

There O
are O
three O
measures O
. O

You O
pick O
the O
biggest O
one O
. O

You O
'd O
have O
to O
buy O
a O
separate O
suitcase O
, O
but O
it O
lacks O
the O
same O
tone O
. O

So O
nothing O
. O

The O
little O
girl O
in O
the O
middle O
is O
rooting O
around O
for O
the O
store O
, O
interested O
more O
in O
toys O
than O
in O
the O
merchandise O
she O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
take O
to O
school O
. O

So O
it O
's O
basically O
82 O
euros O
and O
90 O
cents O
. O

No O
shelves O
, O
no O
drawing O
boards O
, O
no O
scratching O
boards O
? O

The O
shopkeeper O
smiles O
and O
says O
, O

" O
If O
you O
go O
first O
next O
year O
, O
you O
'll O
have O
more O
choice O
. O
" O

I O
practice O
fatherhood O
a O

" O
Maybe O
we O
'll O
see O
each O
other O
in O
three O
years O

" O

TRENDY O
, O
AT O
ALL O
COST O
. O

You O
can O
complain O
that O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
prices O
are O
exorbitant O
. O

It O
's O
understandable O
to O
have O
a O
little O
jealousy O
in O
your O
wallet O
. O

But O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
the O
desire O
to O
buy O
novelty O
always O
prevails O
. O

Whether O
it O
's O
the O
mothers O
, O
when O
the O
babies O
are O
little O
, O
or O
the O
grandmothers O
, O
when O
the O
babies O
are O
older O
, O
buying O
things O
for O
themselves O
. O

For O
kids O
, O
it O
's O
a O
little O
bit O
different O
, O
because O
they O
're O
often O
led O
to O
delegate O
. O

The O
proof O
of O
fashionable O
tension O
comes O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
proposals O
for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
are O
sadly O
buried O
in O
a O
corner O
, O
under O
the O
word O
" O
offer O
. O
" O

Even O
at O
very O
competitive O
prices O
, O
the O
old O
cartoon O
characters O
' O
backpacks O
do O
n't O
matter O
anymore O
. O

And O
so O
the O
Simpsons O
, O
Sabrina O
, O
Arale O
, O
are O
all O
sold O
for O
29 O
to O
39 O
euros O
. O

" O
We O

a O
couple O
of O

They O

they O

out O

Generally O
, O
the O

about O
64 O

90 O

This O

very O
much O
for O
those O

Mario B-PER

able O
to O

When O
she O
was O
driving O
her O
car O
one O
day O
, O
and O
she O
was O
driving O
at O
a O
slow O

she O
saw O
a O

passing O
in O

, O
and O
she O
was O
driving O
at O
a O
slower O
speed O

and O
she O
got O
over O

At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
lady O

and O
she O
had O
done O
the O
job O
correctly O

she O
heard O
the O
shock O
and O
immediately O
saw O
the O
Mercedes O
driver O
turn O
on O
the O
lights O

She O
stopped O
, O
and O
the O
man O
who O
was O
driving O
the O
car O
noticed O
that O
he O
had O
damaged O
his O
left O
rearview O
mirror O

The O
woman O
was O
arrested O
-- O
although O
her O
car O
did O
not O
show O
any O
signs O
of O
her O
alleged O
screaming O

but O
she O
was O
hiding O
to O
repay O
the O
man O

estimated O
damage O
of O
1,000 O

, O
taking O
the O
money O
back O
to O
her O
home O
with O
the O

clutching O

And O
he O
was O
talking O
to O
the O
lady O

and O
the O
impostor O
realized O
that O
the O
person O
in O

him O
could O
still O
be O
caught O

He O
talked O
to O
her O
about O
malaria O

in O
a O
second O
he O
introduced O
her O
to O
Anna B-PER

the O

out O

that O

not O
only O
a O

it O
also O
gave O

The O

the O

ends O
at O
the O

the O

at O

and O
at O

you O

a O

Like O
those O

the O

But O
because O
of O
the O
speed O
with O
which O
the O

rolling O

it O
seems O
that O
the O
narrative O
overlaps O

: O
It O

" O
Do O

can O

But O
then O
it O

also O
about O
measuring O
the O
quality O
of O
the O

that O
are O
often O
overlooked O
. O
" O

Paolo B-PER
Cunego I-PER
of O
the O
Consumer B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
has O
it O
with O
the O
authorities O
who O
decided O
to O
review O
the O
level O
of O
tariffs O
, O
but O
also O
with O
the O
trade O
unions O
. O

" O
In O
June O
, O
there O
were O
plans O
to O
raise O
certain O
tariffs O
, O
which O
have O
been O
in O
place O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

But O
we O
were O
told O
that O
there O
was O
basically O
going O
to O
be O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
bus O
fare O
for O
the O
train O
. O

Instead O
, O
here O
's O
what O
happened O
: O
transportation O
bills O
went O
up O
and O
the O
same O
train O
ticket O
went O
up O
. O

Increases O
in O
transportation O
, O
10 O
percent O
, O
12 O
percent O
. O

In O
the O
last O
few O
days O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
Adoc B-ORG
, O
which O
refers O
to O
Uil B-ORG
, O
has O
let O
us O
know O
that O
the O
cost O
of O
school O
materials O
is O
decreasing O
. O

But O
that O
union O
, O
along O
with O
the O
others O
, O
had O
already O
accepted O
the O
tariff O
increases O
. O
" O

I O
'm O
sorry O
about O
that O
, O
but O
the O
tariff O
level O
was O
flat O
at O
2000 O
. O

" O
Yeah O
, O
but O
inflation O
in O
the O
meantime O
has O
n't O
really O
been O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
that O
governments O
have O
fixed O
, O
and O
wages O
have O
come O
out O
very O
slowly O
. O
" O

And O
there O
's O
something O
else O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
many O
public O
or O
para O
- O
public O
services O
have O
gotten O
worse O
. O

You O
think O
about O
the O
railways O
. O

On O
certain O
stretches O
, O
or O
even O
at O
certain O
times O
of O
the O
year O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
or O
stand O
. O

Let O
's O
think O
about O
the O
convoy O
that O
arrives O
in O
Trento B-LOC
on O
Christmas O
Eve O
. O

At O
this O
point O
I O
'm O
saying O
the O
service O
is O
no O
longer O
in O
line O
with O
the O
tariff O
. O

The O
union O
, O
then O
, O
if O
it O
accepts O
the O
increase O
in O
fees O
, O
it O
must O
demand O
that O
the O
service O
be O
improved O
. O
" O

Paolo B-PER
Cunego I-PER
also O
notes O
that O
in O
this O
way O
, O
the O
use O
of O
the O
public O
medium O
is O
discouraged O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
private O
medium O
. O

But O
the O
train O
is O
a O
national O
fact O
, O
let O
's O
see O
. O

" O
Even O
the O
Valsugana O
railroad O
is O
not O
providing O
adequate O
service O
. O
" O

Finally O
, O
a O
suggestion O
. O

not O

" O
says O
Carlo B-PER
Borzaga I-PER
, O
president O

-- O
" O
because O
we O
have O
a O
faculty B-ORG
of O
400 O
students O
a O
year O
. O

Maintaining O
this O
base O
is O
important O
. O

Over O
the O
longer O
term O
, O
our O
trend O
is O
pretty O
steady O
. O

Let O
's O
not O
forget O
that O
last O
year O
the O
economy B-ORG
grew O
very O
strongly O
, O
and O
we O
're O
facing O
a O
lot O
of O
competition O
. O

In O
perspective O
, O
we O
need O
to O
explain O
to O
young O
people O
that O
our O
faculty B-ORG
is O
not O
technically O
trained O
, O
but O
managers O
who O
are O
able O
to O
engage O
in O
any O
kind O

And O
then O
, O
traditionally O
, O
you O
see O
a O
remarkable O
recovery O
in O
the O

We O
expect O
a O

more O

What O
's O
also O
important O
is O
that O
the O

this O
is O
something O
that O
the O

focused O

of O

but O
at O
the O

time O
, O
I O
feel O
the O
burden O
of O
responsibility O
because O
we O
have O
to O
confirm O
the O
good O

Despite O

It O

only O

that O

10 O

Among O
the O
novelties O
is O
the O
possibility O

Immediately O

it O
will O
be O

The O

take O
long O

and O
it O

estimated O
that O
they O
will O
be O
higher O
than O
the O
number O

. O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
the O
armed O
forces B-ORG
have O
undergone O
a O
radical O
change O
, O
especially O
in O
how O
they O
communicate O
with O
the O
civilian O

They O
were O
very O

Today O
, O
I O
get O
a O
message O
from O
the O
Hunters B-ORG
' I-ORG
Federation I-ORG
. O

I O
've O
been O
indicted O
as O
president O
because O
a O
person O
sold O
the O
livestock O
. O
" O

Would O
you O
like O
to O
explain O
it O
better O
? O

" O
The O
complaint O
was O
made O
by O
Marino B-PER
Paoli I-PER
of O
Civezzano B-LOC
. O

He O
claims O
that O
the O
deer O
was O
his O
, O
that O
he O
raised O
the O
deer O
in O
his O
land O
and O
that O
he O
therefore O
did O
not O
have O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
. O

But O
we O
found O
out O
, O
and O
that O
beast O
had O
fled O
, O
and O
had O
been O
wandering O
the O
woods O
for O
months O
. O

Free O
. O

It O
's O
kind O
of O
reawakened O
. O

And O
how O
could O
our O
hunter O
know O
that O
a O
deer O
that O
passed O
him O
was O
actually O
a O
private O
property O
? O

" O

If O
first O
Roberto B-PER
Ioriatti I-PER
was O
a O
little O
bit O
paralyzed O
, O
then O
he O
was O
also O
a O
little O
bit O
illiterate O
. O

And O
he O
went O
from O
good O
to O
evil O
. O

He O
immediately O
contacted O
Federcaccia B-ORG
's O
headquarters O
in O
Trento B-LOC
, O
and O
then O
some O
lawyers O
in O
the O
province B-LOC
. O

Being O
sued O
, O
though O
not O
criminally O
, O
for O
not O
doing O
anything O
was O
a O
strange O
thing O
. O

But O
going O
for O
it O
was O
not O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

" O
The O
deer O
was O
killed O
in O
Costalta B-LOC
-- O
he O
says O
in O
a O
breath O
-- O
12 O
kilometers O
from O
St. B-LOC
Agnes I-LOC
of I-LOC
Civezzano I-LOC
, O
where O
that O
man O
was O
raising O
the O
deer O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
we O
've O
been O
told O
that O
when O
a O
domestic O
animal O
escapes O
and O
comes O
back O
into O
the O
wild O
, O
it O
comes O
back O
as O
part O
of O
the O
public O
wildlife O
heritage O
. O

So O
, O
in O
our O
case O
, O
it O
was O
catchable O
. O
" O

What O
did O
they O
tell O
her O
to O
do O
in O
the O
Federation B-ORG
? O

" O
They O
comforted O
me O
, O
they O
begged O
me O
not O
to O
move O
. O

That O
things O
will O
be O
clear O
soon O
and O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
fear O
anything O
. O
" O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
very O
unfortunate O
deer O
has O
already O
been O
quartered O
and O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
freezer O
of O
the O
hunter O
who O
killed O
it O
. O

" O
Of O
course O
-- O
adds O
Ioriatti B-PER
-- O
our O
partner O
is O
not O
going O
to O
give O
back O
what O
is O
legitimately O
his O
. O

From O
the O
information O
we O
got O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
the O
animal O
had O
already O
fled O
by O
May O
or O
June O
from O
where O
it O
lived O
in O
captivity O
. O
" O

So O
listen O
to O
the O
other O
bell O
as O
well O
. O

And O
that O
's O
Marino B-PER
Paoli I-PER
on O
the O
territory O
of O
Civezzano B-LOC
doing O
the O
porphyry O
hunt O
. O

" O
That O
beast O
was O
mine O
and O
it O
was O
recognizable O
, O
" O
he O
says O
on O
the O
phone O
. O
" O
The O
deer O
fled O
on O
the O
6th O
of O
May. O

And O
I O
immediately O
reported O
this O
to O
the O
Pergine B-LOC
Forestry O
. O

I O
had O
two O
deer O
, O
a O
male O
and O
a O
female O
. O
" O

And O
what O
did O
he O
do O
about O
it O
? O

Growing O
deer O
is O
certainly O
not O
a O
very O
common O
activity O
. O

" O
I O
'd O
assembled O
them O
at O
the O
Casteller O
Center O
, O
and O
Federcaccia B-ORG
recovers O
the O
injured O
animals O
or O
raises O
the O
abandoned O
young O
. O

Anyway O
, O
after O
the O
escape O
, O
the O
Forestry B-ORG
Department O
made O
an O
overhaul O
of O
my O
house O
. O

So O
, O
having O
reported O
this O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
really O
say O
that O
no O
one O
knew O
anything O
about O
the O
escape O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
beast O
had O
in O
its O
ear O
, O
very O
visibly O
, O
the O
yellow O
ear O
. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
reported O
it O
to O
the O
hunter O
- O
gatherer B-ORG
association I-ORG
. O

And O
now O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
go O
to O
the O
lawyer O
to O
protect O
my O
rights O
. O
" O

But O
according O
to O
her O
-- O
" O
Listen O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
it O
with O
the O
hunter O
who O
fired O
. O

But O
the O
deer O
was O
mine O
, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
get O
another O
one O
back O

That O

It O

President O

reminded O
us O

that O
the O
relationship O
between O

the O

world O
continues O
to O
be O
highly O
critical O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
that O
there O
is O
gender O
asymmetry O
in O
the O
power O
universe O
of O
a O
sector O
that O
is O
particularly O
relevant O
in O
the O
current O
social O
and O
economic O
context O
. O

If O
the O
scientific O
world O
today O
has O
positive O
models O
of O
how O
to O
succeed O
as O
a O
woman O
, O
there O
are O
still O
stronger O
phenomena O
of O
educational O
segregation O
and O
gender O
stereotypes O
. O

Even O
in O
our O

-- O
as O
Marta B-PER

out O

, O
these O
questions O
did O
n't O
go O
away O

What O
's O
the O
point O
? O

Condini B-PER
asks O
. O

In O
light O
of O
the O
decision O
of O
assessor O
Andreatta B-PER
to O
consider O
the O
applications O
submitted O
by O
June O
30th O
of O
this O

to O
Vela B-LOC
, O
they O
claim O
that O
even O
their O
positions O
will O
be O
challenged O
in O

. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
this O
revision O
of O
the O

, O
we O
're O
not O
going O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
rotation O

, O
so O
the O
Vela B-LOC
, O
for O
the O

not O
at O

Residents O
, O
however O
, O
come O
back O

protect O
themselves O
for O

so O
Condini B-PER
, O
in O

also O
wrote O

to O
get O
the O

" O
On O

of O
the O

-- O
he O
insists O
-- O
I O
'm O
asking O
that O
our O
questions O
also O
be O
considered O
at O

once O
, O
in O

of O
another O
favourable O
vote O

" O

Condini B-PER
says O
he O

already O
secured O
the O
support O
of O
Pompermaier B-PER
and O
Pattini B-PER
, O
members O
of O
the O
commission B-ORG
. O

So O
it O
's O
up O
to O
the O
government O
to O
take O
back O
the O
game O
and O
respond O
to O
the O
community O
's O
demands O
. O

" O
We O
believe O
it O
is O
appropriate O
-- O
the O
applicants O
write O
in O
the O
petition O
for O
a O
change O
to O
the O
Prg O
sent O
to O
Mayor O
Pacher B-PER
-- O
that O
the O
entire O
green O
area O
north O
of O
Vela B-LOC
, O
for O
its O
high O
and O
original O
landscape O
and O
environmental O
value O
, O
should O
be O
transformed O
into O
a O
park O
, O
a O

of O
nature O
, O
for O
the O
entire O
city O
. O
" O

Alternatively O
, O
they O
propose O
maintaining O
the O
current O
primary O
agricultural O
green O
target O
( O
as O
envisaged O
by O
the O

and O
establishing O

" O
Within O
this O
range O
of O
respect O
-- O
and O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
step O

there O
will O
be O
no O

that O

all O
started O

a O

The O

a O
wide O
variety O
of O
bars O
, O
nine O
of O
them O
within O
a O
50 O

, O
and O
the O

had O
turned O
against O
the O

of O
the O
feared O
competitor O
. O

They O
were O
mainly O
complaining O
about O
a O
law O
that O
allowed O
for O
a O

contraction O
that O
, O
they O
said O
, O
would O
put O

Because O
if O
there O

" O

But O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
license O
is O
a O
right O
. O

When O
the O
poachers O
reported O
the O
poaching O
on O
Pozzo B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
a O
boycott O
was O
launched O
and O
a O
response O
was O
given O
by O
the O
Consumer B-ORG
Protection I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
, O
which O
welcomed O
the O
new O
arrival O
and O
denounced O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
cartel O
among O
bartenders O
to O
keep O
prices O
high O
. O

Anyway O
, O
after O
the O
controversy O
, O
the O
landlord O
, O
who O
had O
already O
promised O
Dersut B-ORG
that O
he O
would O
stop O
leasing O
, O
retreated O
, O
obviously O
terrified O
of O
the O
flu O
or O
convinced O
by O
the O
pressures O
of O
the O
neighbors O
. O

And O
in O
place O
of O
the O
new O

, O
he O
recently O
opened O
a O
location O
agency O
, O
which O
was O
greeted O
with O
a O
sense O
of O
relief O
from O
the O
powerful O

So O
it O

all O
over O
? O

Not O
even O
for O
a O
dream O

Initially O
, O
Dersut B-ORG

just O
by O

a O
few O

from O
the O

then O
off O
we O
went O

The O
first O
one O
, O
and O
perhaps O
the O
most O
important O
one O
, O
is O
the O
congestion O
of O
the O
highway O
, O
which O
will O
be O
six O
and O
a O
half O
meters O
wide O
on O
average O
. O

This O
, O
in O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
council I-LOC
, O
should O
largely O
inhibit O
the O
use O
of O
the O
road O
by O
the O

who O
now O
bypass O

busy O
Bolzano O

The O

, O
on O
the O

destined O

the O

will O
be O
built O
on O
the O
east O
side O
, O
along O
with O
an O
extensive O
and O
refurbished O
sidewalk O

The O
designers O
took O
care O
of O
every O
aspect O

to O
make O
room O
for O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
, O
the O
existing O
acacia O

will O
be O
removed O
, O
but O
in O
their O
place O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
a O
new O
one O
will O
be O
planted O
at O
the O

as O
the O

one O
, O
coupled O
with O
small O
seedlings O
and O
flower O
species O
. O

Among O
the O
other O
design O
choices O
, O
it O
envisages O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
few O
small O
golf O
courses O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
, O
which O
will O
also O
allow O
the O
creation O
of O

, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
the O

be O
regulated O

There O

think O
of O

the O
ultimate O
possibility O
of O

an O

within O
a O
schematic O
. O

Those O
of O
you O
who O
work O
with O
abstract O
code O
know O
this O
very O
well O
. O

Others O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
think O
of O
the O
freedom O
to O
compose O
as O
a O
space O
that O
is O
open O
to O
their O
own O
inspirations O
, O
usually O
from O
a O
place O
of O
origin O
. O

He O
seems O
to O
be O
in O
this O
second O
category O
, O
Bud B-PER
Blumenthal I-PER
, O
the O
choreographer O
who O
's O
present O
in O

which O
took O

on O
Sunday O
night O
, O
for O
example O
, O
he O
translated O
" O
freely O
" O
into O
Haikus O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
popular O
Japanese O
poetry O
of O
very O
precise O
structure O
and O
symbolism O
. O

Strophes O
made O
up O
of O
a O
few O
lines O
that O
contain O
fixed O
references O

With O
the O
acoustic O
accompaniment O
-- O
a O
little O
over O
half O
an O
hour O
long O
and O
performed O
by O
the O
same O
Blumenthal B-PER
in O
March O
Square O
-- O
these O
short O
poems O
became O
choreographic O
fragments O
that O
could O
change O
mood O
and O
atmosphere O
suddenly O
. O

Everything O
is O
based O
on O
a O
clever O
use O
of O
lights O
, O
a O
phraseology O
of O
essential O
movements O
that O
's O
very O
soft O
and O
in O
direct O
line O
with O
the O
music O
that O
Johan B-PER
Hoogewijs I-PER
himself O
composed O
. O

And O
although O
the O
initial O
impact O
of O
this O
work O
is O
suggestive O
-- O
thanks O
also O
to O
the O
beautiful O
scenic O
presence O
of O
Blumenthal B-PER
-- O
it O
nevertheless O
had O
a O
moment O
of O
reverberation O
towards O
the O
end O
and O
then O
came O
back O
in O
closing O
with O
a O
very O
clean O
haiku O
, O
drawn O
on O
linear O
trajectories O
placed O
on O
the O
surfaces O
of O
the O
stage O
. O

The O
word O
" O
freedom O
" O
comes O
back O
to O
the O
American O
artist O

talks O
when O
he O
happily O
met O
the O
audience O
in O
a O
noontime O

described O
his O

Professor O
Pugliese B-PER
, O
what O
does O
n't O
persuade O
you O
of O
the O
proposals O
made O
by O
the O
judge O
Gilmozzi B-PER
? O

They O
're O
useful O
measures O
, O
like O
the O
ones O
we O
put O
in O
place O
last O
year O
, O
but O
they O
're O
not O
enough O
. O

The O
effects O
were O
n't O
visible O
. O

It O
's O
not O
enough O
just O
to O
block O
some O
diesel O
to O
hope O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
of O
thin O
dust O

What O
's O
your O
opinion O
? O

better O
put O
in O
place O
a O
blocking O
system O
at O
different O
rates O
? O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
that O
solution O
had O
more O
benefits O
. O

If O
nothing O
else O
, O
it O
delivered O
a O
stronger O
message O
to O
the O
citizens O
, O
because O
everyone O
was O
involved O
somehow O
. O

Today O
, O
it O
's O
different O
. O

The O
measure O
only O
affects O
a O
few O
vehicles O
, O
and O
95 O
percent O
of O
the O
30s O
have O
lost O
interest O
in O
following O
the O
story O
. O

How O
does O
the O
' O
30s O
compare O
to O
the O
problem O
of O
air O
pollution O
? O

Do O
they O
get O
informed O
? O

Are O
they O
sensitive O
? O

I O
would O
say O
yes O
. O

The O
problem O
, O
though O
, O
is O
that O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
get O
from O
theory O
to O
practice O
when O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
measures O
are O
first O
- O
hand O
. O

Just O
to O
give O
you O
one O
example O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
gasoline O
consumption O
has O
dropped O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
traffic O
is O
still O
the O
number O
one O
cause O
of O
end O
- O
of O
- O
life O
pollutants O
. O

If O
you O
were O
a O
provincial B-LOC
councillor O
, O
what O
would O
you O
tell O
the O
councillor O
? O

One O
is O
the O
emergency O
, O
the O
other O
is O
the O
structural O
plan O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
first O
aspect O
is O
concerned O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
it O
's O
clear O
that O
there O
's O
very O
little O
being O
done O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
'm O
in O
favor O
of O
alternate O
rates O
, O
total O
circulation O
blocks O
, O
maybe O
even O
on O
scheduled O
days O
. O

What O
about O
structural O
intervention O
? O

In O
a O
word O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
what O
the O
Province B-LOC
says O
: O

alternative O
mobility O
, O
enhanced O
public O
transportation O
, O
bicycle O
use O
. O

The O
trouble O
is O
, O
you O
talk O
a O
lot O
, O
you O
write O
a O
lot O
, O
but O
it O
's O
all O
moving O
very O
slowly O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
well O
- O
deserved O
public O
transportation O
service O
should O
actually O
make O
it O
appropriate O
. O

In O
Trento B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
is O
good O
, O
but O
on O
the O
outskirts O
, O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
more O
to O
be O
done O
. O

For O
example O
? O

The O
Valsugana O
subway O
. O

You O
've O
been O
talking O
about O
it O
for O
years O
, O
but O
when O
will O
we O
actually O
be O
able O
to O
use O
it O
? O

This O
is O
a O
direct O
criticism O
of O
the O
province B-LOC
. O

They O
produce O
a O
lot O
of O
documents O
, O
but O
they O
actually O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
investments O
only O
for O
tunnels O
, O
for O
bridges O
and O
for O
roads O
. O

In O
other O
words O

promote O
private O
traffic O

about O
the O

, O

the O
cost O
of O

for O

? O

I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
good O
idea O
in O
principle O
. O

But O
then O
there O
's O
the O
problem O

actually O

it O

What O

" O
is O
the O
crossing O

it O

important O
that O
the O

the O

and O
to O
respond O
strongly O
to O
the O
culture O
of O

to O
a O
militarized O

that O

not O

" O
Beyond O

the O
obvious O

, O
" O
Purin B-PER
insisted O
, O
" O
this O

must O
also O
be O
an O
occasion O

On O

Nicola B-PER

" O
This O
is O
where O
the O
children O
, O
who O
are O
our O
future O
, O
are O
at O
stake O
. O

That O
's O
why O
the O
silence O
of O
this O
fiasco O
has O
to O
be O
terrifying O
, O
because O
the O
culture O
of O

. O

We O
need O
to O
start O
to O
rethink O
-- O
Ferrante B-PER
concluded O
-- O
the O
value O
of O

for O

. O

And O
so O
we O
invite O
all O
parents O
to O
bring O
their O
children O
to O
the O
demonstration O
, O
because O
Thirty B-LOC
becomes O
not O
just O
an O
Alpine O

a O
city O
of O
peace O

" O

The O
need O
to O
" O
bring O

to O
the O
streets O
, O
" O
which O
was O
also O
emphasized O
by O
Walter B-PER

" O
so O
that O
they O
understand O
what O

so O
that O
the O

trust O
in O
the O

asks O
Moeglin B-PER

in O

in O

you O
have O
to O
start O
again O

again O
telling O
what O
the O

book O
is O
n't O
, O
rather O
than O
telling O
what O
it O
is O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
problem O
comes O
from O
the O
outside O

from O
the O
success O
of O
the O
expression O

by O
the O

In O

, O
Moeglin B-PER
-- I-PER
Delcroix I-PER

really O
the O
one O
who O
has O
worked O
most O
hard O
to O

" O
to O
distinguish O
between O
the O
self O

is O

is O
halfway O

that O

what O

just O
a O
beautiful O
piece O
after O
hitting O
the O
ground O
in O
Chisinau B-LOC

Just O
think O
, O
as O
the O
two O
teams O
were O
preparing O
to O
move O
to O
the O
national O
stadium O
for O
their O
first O

, O
the O
Moldovan O

The O
two O

on O

were O
waiting O

and O
the O
answer O
came O
from O
the O
beautiful O
sun O
that O
welcomed O
the O
blue O

But O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
everybody O
wondered O
what O
the O
real O
political O
situation O
was O
, O
after O
the O

left O

decided O
to O
move O
the O
big O

from O
Tiraspol B-LOC
for O
internal O

the O
answer O
came O
from O
a O
very O
different O
Chisinau B-LOC
from O
the O
one O
found O
in O
' O
96 O
in O
Under B-ORG
and O
Italy B-ORG
in O
Sacchi B-PER
, O
and O
then O
the O
smiles O
spread O
from O
young O
people O
on O
the O
streets O
of O
downtown O
and O
around O
the O
hotel O
of O
the O
team O
. O

where O
the O
control O
device O
was O
all O
in O
a O
police O

two O
internal O

. O

Less O

a O

a O

" O
Chisinau B-LOC
is O
very O
different O
from O
what O
it O
was O
seven O

, O

less O
sad O
and O
quiet O
city O
, O
" O
says O
Claudio B-PER
Culini I-PER
, O
accompanied O
by O
Under B-ORG
. O

The O
echo O
of O
tensions O
with O
Tiraspol B-LOC
is O
far O
away O
, O
so O
hidden O
are O
the O
implications O
of O
the O
difficult O
economic O
situation O
. O

Eighty O
percent O
of O
the O
population O
is O
below O
the O
poverty O
line O
, O
inflation O
is O
around O
11.7 O
percent O
, O
and O
Moldova B-LOC
is O
stuck O
on O
the O
European O
train O
. O

And O
then O
last O
August O
, O
political O
tensions O
were O
very O
high O
. O

The O
Russian O
population O
in O
the O
Transnistrian B-LOC
Autonomous O
Region O
-- O
13 O
percent O
of O
the O
total O
population O
of O
five O
million O
, O
Romanians O
64 O
percent O
-- O
opposed O
the O
opening O
of O
a O
Romanian O
- O
language O
elementary O
school O
. O

The O
war O
between O
the O
two O
ethnic O
groups O
in O
' O
94 O
caused O
thousands O
of O
deaths O
, O
and O
when O
last O
summer O
forcibly O
parents O
and O
children O
lined O
up O
to O
enroll O
were O
taken O
away O
from O
the O
dominant O
ethnic O
group O
in O
Tiraspol B-LOC
, O
the O
ghosts O
of O
the O
past O
reappeared O
far O
away O
. O

So O
, O
even O
though O
the O
situation O
had O
calmed O
down O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
government O
of O
Chisinau B-LOC
decided O
last O
Friday O
to O
annul O
the O
capital O
of O
Tiraspol B-LOC
, O
in O
striking O
coincidence O
with O
the O
Baslan B-LOC
tragedy O

Inevitably O
the O
anxiety O
with O
which O
, O
despite O
thousands O
of O
miles O
from O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
hell O
, O
the O
Italian O
group O
experienced O
the O
approach O
of O
Chisinau B-LOC
. O

Then O
, O
direct O
contact O
relieved O
doubts O
and O
fears O
. O

even O

At O
that O
point O
, O
though O
, O
it O
remained O
to O
define O
the O
complicated O
program O

The O
possibility O

completely O
expired O

even O
though O
the O

You O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
reasoning O

what O

led O
the O

commit O

. O

The O
defenders O
of O

had O
good O
reason O

hope O

the O
solution O

In O
particular O
, O
there O
was O
a O
ruling O
handed O
down O
by O
the O
judge O
to O
Commander O
Calabresi B-PER
, O
a O
flight O
dean O
, O
that O
ruled O
out O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
organizers O
. O

The O
defense O
argued O
that O
there O
was O
no O
causal O
link O
because O
the O
death O
would O
have O
been O
attributed O
to O
a O
treacherous O
race O
by O
Tiberius B-PER
Riva I-PER
himself O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
second O
aspect O
to O
defense O
. O

at O
any O
time O
, O
competitors O
could O
stop O
the O
race O
and O
land O
in O
specially O
identified O
areas O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
judge O
found O
that O
there O
was O
a O
liability O
, O
or O
maybe O
a O
responsibility O
, O
on O
Lorenz B-PER

part O
, O
and O
only O
on O
his O
part O
. O

Probably O

a O
little O

more O
than O

we O
thought O

could O
be O

at O

a O
very O
important O
part O
of O
it O

did O

In O

it O
was O
Valerio B-PER
, O
that O
little O
, O
thin O
kid O
with O
a O
squiggly O
hat O
on O
his O
smart O
, O
still O
- O
moving O
eyes O
, O
bringing O
us O
, O
perhaps O
unconsciously O
, O
to O
the O
stage O
, O
one O
of O
the O
many O
that O
offer O
life O
to O
you O
: O

of O
which O
there O
were O
all O
those O
who O
played O
, O
well O
, O
but O
for O
hobbies O
, O
there O
were O
only O
those O
few O
who O
accepted O
retreats O
and O
sacrifices O
in O
order O
to O
become O
professional O
players O
. O

And O
the O
transition O
was O
n't O
just O
a O
question O
of O
skill O
, O
it O
was O
also O
a O
question O
of O
mind O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
Valerio B-PER
, O
though O
, O
it O
's O
also O
been O
a O
question O
of O
goodness O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

It O
's O
just O
that O
we O
were O
friends O
and O
we O
were O
n't O
sending O
him O
to O
that O
country O
when O
, O
maybe O
without O
a O
hit O
, O
he O
was O
paving O
us O
with O
a O
bullet O
from O
the O
back O
of O
the O
field O
. O

You O
could O
take O
it O
in O
all O
directions O
, O
right O
and O
back O
, O
but O
he O
always O
took O
it O
and O
sent O
it O
away O
long O
, O
hard O
and O
vexingly O
deep O
. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
arm O
, O
especially O
for O
backwards O
. O
He O
's O
injured O
. O

And O
now O
, O
three O
or O
four O
tennis O
centuries O
later O
, O
we O
found O
him O
in O

of O
us O
, O
on O
a O
cold O
autumn O
day O
, O
in O
the O
newspaper O
of O
his O
circle O
, O
in O
Riva B-LOC

talking O
about O
what O
tennis O
was O
and O
what O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
. O

We O
've O
changed O
, O
but O
not O
so O
much O
, O
or O
at O
least O
not O
so O
much O
inside O
. O

He O
's O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
voluminous O
, O
but O
he O
has O
the O
faces O
of O
men O
who O
are O
in O
peace O

consciousness O
and O
, O
most O
importantly O
, O
who O
are O
doing O
work O
that O
they O
love O

Yes O
, O
because O
he O
, O
who O
graduated O
as O

in O
the O
late O
' O
68s O

still O
ca O
n't O
be O
an O
autocrat O
rolling O
back O
and O
forth O
and O
fiddling O
with O
suggestions O

he O

passionate O

the O
lesson O

every O
lesson O

as O
if O
it O
were O
the O
first O
of O

I O

live O

even O
though O
I O
've O
lived O
in O
Rome B-LOC

in O

that O

why O
I O
consider O
it O
my O
circle O

not O
my O
circle O

I O
work O

That O
means O
it O

got O
a O
number O

And O
then O
I O
relate O
to O
the O
kids O
who O
come O
to O
school O

I O
'd O
always O
like O

at O
the O
age O

six O

following O
his O

a O
country O

His O

home O

in O

was O
near O
the O
Casino O

the O
Benacino O

of O

time O

boasting O
great O
players O
like O
Alberti B-PER
, O
Oradini B-PER
, O
Dallago B-PER

Malossini B-PER
-- O
and O
perhaps O
it O
was O
for O
that O
that O
he O
chose O
the O
racquetball O
sport O
. O

His O
first O
teacher O
was O
a O
certain O
Masprone B-PER

a O
thousand O

year O
- O
old O
translator O
on O
the O
Garda B-LOC

" O
Yes O
, O
I O
started O
with O
him O
, O
but O
then O
a O
lot O
of O
teachers O
helped O
me O
grow O
up O

who O
was O
a O
very O
good O

young O

Then O
, O
when O
I O
was O
15 O
, O
I O
went O
to O
Ct O

Rovereto O
, O
and O
I O
found O
in O
Pipetto B-PER

a O
great O

, O
above O
all O
, O
a O
friend O

He O
would O
take O

he O
would O
copulate O

almost O

At O
a O
young O

up O

career O

the O

2 O

Something O
so O
wise O
for O
a O
young O
person O
or O
someone O
who O
's O
just O
starting O
to O
play O
tennis O
, O
what O
might O
that O
relate O
to O
in O
today O
's O
rankings O
? O

" O
It O
's O
hard O
to O
compare O
. O

Let O
's O
say O
I O
had O
a O
hair O
from O
scratch O
that O
was O
half O
the O
size O
of O
a O
second B-ORG
grade I-ORG
kid O

But O
you O
have O
to O
say O
-- O
2 O

6 O
in O
Italy B-LOC
was O
three O
or O
four O
, O
and O
four O
or O
five O
was O
the O
first B-ORG
category I-ORG
. O
" O

So O
you O
're O
up O
there O
? O

" O
Well O
, O
enough O
. O
" O

Then O
you O
decided O
to O
become O
a O
teacher O
. O

" O
It O
was O
the O
only O
flaw O
. O

Secondary B-ORG
tours O
were O
few O
, O
you O
had O
to O
tour O
a O
lot O
, O
there O
were O
no O

Hard O
years O
, O
you O
know O
, O
even O
though O
I O
've O
had O
some O
pretty O
satisfying O
ones O
, O
playing O
and O
winning O
with O
people O
who O
've O
later O
made O
careers O

So O
I O
went O
to O
Rome B-LOC

to O
the O
National B-ORG
School I-ORG
of O
Teachers O
, O
and O
within O
two O
years O
, O
in O
' O
68 O
, O
I O
graduated O
. O

I O
found O
a O
place O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC
early O
on O
, O
and O
then O
, O
in O
' O
74 O
, O
I O
came O
to O
Riva B-LOC
. O

And O
here O
I O
am O
. O
" O

I O
freak O
out O
like O
a O
pinkie O
. O

" O
That O
's O
enough O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
sorry O
. O

It O
's O
also O
because O
I O
've O
always O
been O
able O
to O
work O
really O
well O
and O
help O
a O
lot O
of O
kids O
grow O
up O
. O
" O

There O
are O
some O
pretty O
names O
that O
came O
out O
of O
your O
school O
. O

concerned O

after O

does O
it O
seem O
to O
you O

too O

that O

is O
slowly O
gaining O
ground O

" O
That O

true O

please O

say O
it O
out O
loud O

very O
loud O
. O
" O

A O
life O
with O
a O
box O
in O
its O
hand O
, O
how O
many O
characters O
, O
how O
many O
anecdotes O

Not O
enough O

've O
played O
with O
Michele B-PER

now O

most O
of O
all O
, O
I O
've O
been O
lucky O
, O
working O
in O
a O
tourist O
area O
, O
to O
meet O
teachers O
from O
other O
countries O
, O
the O
Germans O

" O

Is O
it O
harder O
to O
teach O
backwards O
or O
to O
set O
up O
a O
mindset O
? O

" O
The O
shock O
is O
the O
easiest O
, O
the O
hard O
comes O
after O
. O
" O

I O
've O
always O
preached O
that O
tennis O
, O
playing O
tennis O
, O
should O
be O
a O
joy O
even O
if O
you O
take O
it O
seriously O
. O

And O
then O
I O
realized O
that O
between O
parents O
and O
managers O
, O
kids O
are O
overloaded O
with O
expectations O
and O
stress O
. O

We O
teachers O
have O
to O
move O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
and O
that O
's O
the O
hardest O
part O
of O
our O
job O
. O
" O

Now O
do O
you O
have O
children O
who O
can O
have O
a O
future O
? O

" O
Yeah O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

We O
let O
children O
grow O
up O
and O
grow O
up O
in O
peace O
. O

And O
that O
's O
where O
my O
assistants O
Corinne B-PER

Bernardine B-PER
are O
perfectly O
in O
sync O
. O
" O

When O
will O
you O
stop O
? O

" O
When O
I O
'm O
tired O
of O
being O
in O
the O
field O
, O
when O
I O
realize O
I O
'm O
beginning O
to O
let O
go O
of O
technical O
errors O

That O
will O
be O
the O

what O
it O

What O
is O
the O

" O
It O
's O
a O
project O
that O
the O

promoting O
in O
all O

the O
intention O

bringing O

increasing O
number O

A O
promotion O
of O

as O

European O
countries O
do O
, O
by O
encouraging O
the O
circuitization O
of O
performances O
, O
accompanied O
by O
training O
initiatives O
. O
" O

What O
's O
this O
going O
to O
bring O
to O
Trentino B-LOC
? O

" O
A O
greater O
presence O
of O
companies O
, O
of O
dance O
performances O
, O
and O
also O
a O
whole O
range O
of O
cultural O

activities O
: O

meetings O
, O
discussions O
, O

But O
more O
importantly O
, O
performances O

The O
circuit O
says O
that O
there O
's O
a O
minimum O
amount O
of O
access O
to O
this O
national O
regulation O
: O

In O
one O
year O
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
make O
at O
least O
24 O
shows O
in O
the O

" O

Does O
that O
mean O
access O
to O
an O
important O
source O
of O
funding O
? O

" O
First O
of O
all O
, O
a O
meaningful O
subsidy O
. O

But O
the O
interest O
is O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
is O
being O
identified O
as O
one O
of O
the O
hotspots O
for O
a O
nationally O
breathed O
circuit O
. O

It O
's O
also O
a O
recognition O
for O
the O
Rotary B-ORG
International I-ORG
for O
the O
work O
done O
through O
the O
Festival O
and O
the O
CID B-ORG

This O
is O
extremely O
good O
news O
for O
us O
and O
for O
Rovereto B-LOC
, O
which O
is O
the O
home O
of O
both O
realities O
. O

in O
fact O
becomes O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
territories O
at O
the O
national O
level O
and O
not O
just O
in O
the O
field O
of O
contemporary O
dance O
. O
" O

You O
were O
chosen O
as O
the O
only O
official O
reference O

will O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
entity O
change O
to O
manage O
the O
new O
function O

the O
availability O
of O
funds O

" O
No O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
change O
anything O
at O
all O

this O
is O

goes O

extra O

offering O

It O
's O
also O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
there O
are O
no O

seasons O
in O

you O
sporadically O
do O
some O
shows O

but O
not O
articulated O
programming O
, O
nor O
a O
circuit O

Instead O
, O
with O
this O
ministerial O
endorsement O
, O
there O
's O
an O
opportunity O
to O
put O
online O
a O
series O
of O

that O
want O
to O
take O
advantage O

this O
opportunity O
to O
create O
a O
circuit O
that O
will O
be O
displayed O
even O
in O
their O

" O

Will O
the O
festival O
then O
find O
a O
way O
to O
allocate O
the O
funds O
that O
have O
been O
made O
available O
to O

entities O

" O
The O
Ministry O

funds O
go O
to O

This O
allows O
you O
to O
organize O
a O
project O
that O
can O
also O
be O
funded O
by O

This O
will O
make O
it O

than O
can O

are O
there O

more O

At O
the O
local O
level O
, O
there O
's O
going O
to O
be O
another O
possibility O
that O
you O
can O
always O
tap O
into O
. O

It O
's O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
ministry B-ORG
that O
this O
is O
an O
initiative O
that O
should O
encourage O
the O
addition O

some O
of O

Let O

wait O
for O
the O
ministry O
to O
define O
the O
figure O

depends O

despite O

talk O
about O
it O
before O

The O
great O
work O
behind O
the O
scenes O
of O
Oliviero B-PER
Rigotti I-PER
and O
Renato B-PER
Vindimian I-PER
-- O
two O
of O
the O
most O
active O
of O
the O
nine O
who O
refounded O
the O
Trent B-ORG
-- O
and O
probably O
also O
the O
results O
achieved O
by O
the O
team O
-- O
four O
wins O
in O
five O
competitions O
, O
second O
in O
the O

bearing O
the O
first O
significant O
fruits O

The O
Trentino B-ORG
does O
n't O
leave O
, O
it O
doubles O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
yellow O
board O
of O
directors O
that O
's O
going O
to O
be O
convened O
next O
week O
is O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
discuss O
raising O
social O
capital O
, O
because O
nine O
other O
companies O
are O
ready O
to O
go O
into O
the O
button O
room O
on O
Sanseverino B-ORG
Street I-ORG
. O

Some O
of O
these O
companies O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
are O
in O
their O
30s O
-- O
like O
Technostyl B-ORG
or O
Isocold B-ORG
, O
which O
are O
going O
to O
brand O
, O
as O
a O
sponsor O
, O
their O
kite O
team O
. O

but O
also O
artisanal O
enterprises O
, O
like O
Mauro B-PER
Giacca I-PER
's O
, O
who O
after O
a O
lot O
of O
out O
- O
of O
- O
time O
drumming O
, O
this O
time O
he O
's O
actually O
going O
to O
come O
in O
. O

There O
seem O
to O
be O
even O
people O
, O
like O
Francesco B-PER
Giovanelli I-PER
, O
one O
of O
the O
founders O
of O
Isocold B-ORG
, O
who O
's O
willing O
to O
enter O
society O
on O
a O
personal O
basis O
. O

From O
each O
of O
the O
new O
nine O
, O
they O
're O
going O
to O
reap O
15,000 O
euros O
in O
revenue O
from O
the O
Trentinos B-ORG
. O

the O
total O
social O
capital O
would O
go O
up O
to O
270,000 O
euros O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
all O
that O
would O
be O
missing O
would O
be O
the O
much O
- O
anticipated O
, O
much O
- O
anticipated O
, O
much O
- O
un O
- O
guaranteed O
participation O
of O
public O
money O
, O
with O
the O
cooperation B-ORG
that O
's O
blossoming O
and O
the O
brand O
that O
's O
going O
to O
be O
put O
on O
the O
coat O
hangers O
that O
's O
still O
lining O
up O
. O

The O
private O
sector O
seems O
to O
have O
done O
it O
. O

and O
the O
expansion O
of O
the O
partnership O
would O
be O
a O
tangible O
proof O
of O
that O
, O
and O
it O
raises O
the O
optimism O
around O
the O
yellow O
- O
and O
- O
white O
colors O
that O
are O
being O
thrown O
out O
in O
the O
field O
by O
Christian B-PER
Maraner I-PER
's O
band O
, O
and O
are O
now O
being O
reintroduced O
in O
the O
territorial O
sphere O
by O
the O
city O

businesses O
that O
are O
joining O
the O
group O
that O
has O
begun O
the O
third O
kite O
redesign O
in O
the O
last O
decade O
. O

There O
's O
still O
a O
strong O
response O
in O
the O
House O
of O
Trent B-ORG
to O
this O
, O
though O
. O

President O
Massimo B-PER
Dalfovo I-PER
said O
this O
lovingly O
: O

" O
We O
've O
always O
argued O
that O
ours O

be O

an O

next O

, O
the O

going O
to O
meet O

and O
we O
'll O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

So O
far O
, O
there O
are O
some O
encouraging O
signs O
. O
" O

Signs O
that O
aim O
for O
confirmation O
, O
black O
on O
white O

Like O
the O
Asis B-ORG
convention O
, O
which O
gives O
the O
kite O
society O
a O
kind O
of O
prerogative O
in O
the O
use O
of O
the O
Briamasco O

With O
the O

in O

the O
athletic O
community O
can O
move O

by O
the O
time O
the O

is O
down O

the O
temple O

The O
team O
is O
doing O
everything O
, O
on O
the O
pitch O
, O
to O
make O
it O
happen O
. O

in O
society O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
want O
to O
stay O
behind O
. O

At O
Honda O

I O
took O
a O
mirror O
thief O

The O

surprised O
him O
by O

It O

a O
sporting O

well O
as O
a O
solidarity O
endeavor O

This O
is O
the O
project O
of O
the O
Goa O

champion O
Stefano B-PER
Sartori I-PER
, O
who O
's O
going O
to O
go O
to O
Nepal B-LOC
tonight O
to O
try O
to O
set O
the O
record O
for O
the O
Annapurna B-LOC
circuit O
. O

It O
's O
a O
challenge O
that O
she O
wanted O
to O
share O
with O
the O
Apeiron B-ORG
Association O
, O
which O
in O
Nepal B-LOC
runs O
a O
number O
of O
charity O
projects O
, O
including O
a O
home O
for O
mothers O
in O

and O
other O
supportive O

abandoned O

The O
company O
will O
also O
serve O
to O
promote O
and O
support O
the O
activities O
of O
Apeiron B-ORG
, O
since O
Sartori B-PER
's O
sponsors O
have O
also O
contributed O
to O
the O
association O
, O
which O
also O
has O
a O
headquarters O
in O
Pergine B-LOC
and O
is O
headed O
by O
lawyer O
Giuseppe B-PER
Benanti I-PER
. O

From O
an O
athlete O
's O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
endeavor O
is O
quite O
challenging O
. O

It O
's O
the O
most O
famous O
hike O
in O
the O
Himalayas B-LOC
. O
It O
's O
210 O
kilometers O
, O
and O
it O
starts O
at O
800 O
meters O
, O
goes O
up O
to O
5,000 O
, O
and O
then O
back O
down O
to O
where O
it O
started O
. O

So O
far O
the O
track O
record O
is O
nine O
days O
, O
set O
by O
four O
Germans O
. O

Sartori B-PER
takes O
four O
days O
. O

The O
Goa O
championship O
is O
n't O
new O
to O
these O
kinds O
of O
ventures O
. O

In O
1998 O
, O
he O
finished O
second O
in O
the O
world O
championship O
of O
the O
high O
altitude O
marathon O
in O
Tibet B-LOC
. O

This O
year O
he O
came O
eighth O
in O
the O
world O
championship O
of O
the O
100 O
kilometers O
in O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
. O

In O
his O
career O
, O
he O
won O
twice O
as O
many O
miles O
as O
the O
passenger O
, O
and O
he O
competed O
in O
many O
other O
races O
. O

His O
specialty O
has O
become O
the O
so O
- O
called O
ultramarathon O
, O
a O
challenge O
to O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
impossible O
for O
ordinary O
people O
, O
the O
bread O
of O
his O
day O
. O

Sartori B-PER
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
does O
n't O
hide O
the O
difficulty O
. O

" O
The O
goal O
I O
set O
myself O
was O
to O
go O
the O
250 O
miles O
in O
as O
little O
time O
as O
possible O
. O

In O
theory O
, O
I O
could O
do O
it O
in O
four O
days O
, O
thinking O
I O
could O
do O
52 O
kilometers O
a O
day O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
said O
. O

The O
biggest O
challenge O
is O
the O
altitude O
. O

The O
starting O
point O
is O
840 O
meters O
, O
then O
you O
go O
up O
to O
5,000 O
and O
400 O
, O
and O
then O
you O
shrink O
. O

The O
route O
is O
the O
classic O
route O
of O
the O
Annapurna B-LOC
trekking O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
famous O
of O
the O
Himalayas B-LOC
. O

I O
've O
already O
run O
at O
high O
stakes O
. O

In O
1998 O
, O
I O
came O
second O
surprisingly O
in O
the O
world O
championships O
in O
Tibet B-LOC
, O
and O
I O
saw O
that O
I O
reacted O
well O
, O
but O
every O
race O
is O
an O
feat O
in O
its O
own O
right O
. O

We O
need O
to O
see O
how O
it O
goes O
this O
time O
. O
" O

The O
actual O
event O
will O
start O
on O
October O
16th O
, O
after O
a O
few O
days O
of O
setting O
up O
. O

The O
next O
day O
Sartori B-PER
is O
supposed O
to O
go O
up O
to O
the O
Thorong B-LOC
Pass I-LOC
and O
from O
there O
start O
the O
downhill O
to O
the O
arrival O
. O

He O
's O
going O
to O
run O
down O
a O
20 O
- O
foot O
path O
, O
and O
he O
's O
going O
to O
sleep O
in O
the O
tents O
that O
are O
usually O
used O
for O
hikers O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

To O
eat O
, O
Sartori B-PER
has O
to O
arrange O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
carry O
in O
my O
backpack O
integrator O
bars O
and O
energy O
- O
enhancing O
grains O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
eat O
in O
the O
ice O
cream O
at O
night O
. O

For O
the O
system O
, O
there O
will O
be O
things O
that O
the O
carriers O
will O
carry O
before O
they O
depart O
. O

From O
that O
point O
of O
view O
, O
there O
should O
be O
no O
problem O
. O
" O

Nor O
should O
the O
Maoist O
rebels O
, O
who O
control O
most O
of O
Nepal O
's O
territory O
, O
create O
problems O
. O

" O
As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
" O
Sartori B-PER
explains O
, O
" O
they O
never O
touched O
tourists O
, O
even O
because O
they O
know O
that O
they O
carry O
precious O
currency O
and O
they O
also O
buy O
local O
crafts O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
happen O
is O
that O
they O
stop O
you O
and O
they O
give O
you O
a O
handkerchief O
about O
their O
mathematical O
principles O
, O
and O
then O
they O
let O
you O
go O
after O
you O
asked O
for O
a O
few O
dollars O
' O
worth O
of O
a O
bowl O
. O
" O

So O
there O
should O
n't O
be O
any O
particular O
dangers O
. O

There O
remains O
the O
unknown O
, O
represented O
by O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
undertaking O
versus O
the O
altitude O
: O

" O
I O
just O
won O
50 O
kilometers O
in O
more O
than O
three O
hours O
. O

That O
's O
a O
six O
- O
hour O
calculation O
, O
if O
all O
goes O
well O
. O

We O
hope O
to O
keep O
that O
pace O
. O

Anyway O
, O
there O
's O
no O
precedent O
to O
be O
relied O
on O
. O

The O
only O
ones O
are O
these O
Germans O
who O
did O
it O
in O
nine O
days O
, O
but O
they O
did O
it O
in O
four O
days O
. O

That O
's O
kind O
of O
cool O
to O
do O
on O
your O
own O
. O

It O

a O

The O

Dellasega I-PER

will O
go O
through O

The O
need O
to O
make O
the O

the O
Federation B-ORG
more O
efficient O
and O
rational O
is O
one O
of O
the O
goals O
that O
Dellasega B-PER
set O
himself O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
was O
officially O
appointed O
director O

So O
within O
a O
few O
months O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
put O
in O

that O
strategic O

, O
which O
is O
going O
to O
have O
to O
define O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
the O
goals O
that O
the O
Federation B-ORG
intends O
to O
focus O
on O
for O
the O
social O
co O
- O
operatives O
that O
are O
also O
customers O
. O

And O
just O
on O
this O
dual O
role O
of O
joining O
an O
organization O
that O
has O
to O
become O
a O
trade O
union O
and O
of O
clients O
that O
serve O
Segantini B-ORG
services O
, O
the O
redrafting O

then O
the O
future O

of O
the O

Based O
on O
what O
had O
been O
repeatedly O
pointed O
out O
by O
the O
director O

the O

himself O
, O
the O
need O

not O

the O

Both O
Schelfi B-PER

want O
this O

be O
shared O
as O
much O
as O

in O

to O
give O
the O

Think O
about O

Imagine O

it O

what O

In O

renowned O

who O
have O
put O
their O

It O
's O
an O
interesting O
idea O
that O
has O
to O
do O
with O
comparing O
ourselves O
to O
the O

This O
is O
the O
title O
of O
the O
event O
: O
" O
Interfacies O

" O

In O
the O
words O
of O
curator O
Bonazzi B-PER
, O
this O
week O
, O
" O
Asteria O
will O
not O
only O
be O
the O
site O
of O
an O
event O
, O
a O
crossroads O
and O
a O
crossroads O
of O
technical O
and O
creative O

, O
but O
also O
the O
hub O
of O
exchanges O
and O

. O

In O
this O
place O
, O
between O

, O
multiple O
acts O
and O
boundaries O
, O
between O
connections O
and O
linguistic O
parameters O
, O
artists O
are O
encouraged O
to O
engage O
their O
language O
with O
new O
technologies O
. O
" O

Let O
's O
look O
very O
quickly O
and O
not O
necessarily O
at O
who O
the O
artists O
involved O
were O
and O
what O
they O
proposed O
. O

Let O
's O
start O
with O
Antoni B-PER
Abad I-PER
, O
who O
created O
a O
benign O
virus O
made O
out O
of O
a O
pixel O
fly O
that O
flies O
freely O
through O
computer O
screens O
and O
is O
able O
to O
replicate O
over O
the O
Internet O
and O
create O
a O
virtual O
fly O
swarm O
. O

Then O
we O
go O
to O
the O
work O
of O
Stefano B-PER
Cagol I-PER
and O
his O
plays O
of O
the O
subway O
skyscraper O
that O
re O
- O
create O
strange O
and O
familiar O
landscapes O
. O

So O
it O
's O
Loris B-PER
Cecchini I-PER
's O
turn O
with O
her O
unlikely O
yet O
real O
architecture O
to O
do O
the O
design O
of O
a O
squatter O
house O
built O
on O
a O
pillar O
of O
light O
. O

And O
then O
there O
's O
Eva B-PER
Marisaldi I-PER
's O
imaginative O
, O
imaginary O
landscapes O
that O
take O
viewers O
on O
an O
uninterrupted O
journey O
. O

It O
illustrates O
the O
work O
of O
Takehito B-PER
Koganezawa I-PER
who O
obtains O
endless O
symphonies O
by O
sampling O
images O
and O
noises O
from O
everyday O
life O
. O

And O
then O
Louis B-PER
Nero I-PER
's O
experimental O
video O
that O
takes O
the O
experience O
of O
filmmaking O
into O
video O
art O
with O
surprising O
results O
of O
poetry O
and O
existential O
suspension O
. O

The O
path O
between O
the O
corporate O
corridors O
continues O
with O
Oliver B-PER
Pietsch I-PER
's O
work O
with O
three O
fragments O
of O
a O
path O
between O
the O
surreal O
and O
the O
real O
. O

To O
follow O
Xenja B-PER
Plasma I-PER
with O
a O
video O
that O
is O
a O
clear O
, O
vibrant O
, O
oxygenating O
dream O
in O
the O
eternal O
quest O
for O
hospitality O
. O

Sensual O
and O
cross O
- O
cutting O
is O
the O
work O
of O
Kiki B-PER
Seror I-PER
, O
who O
borrows O
verbal O
images O
from O
chat O
rooms O
to O
highlight O
what O
the O
web O
produces O
and O
proposes O
. O

It O
concludes O
the O
collective O
performance O
with O
a O
work O
by O
Giulia B-PER
Zuanni I-PER
that O
abandons O
image O
communication O
and O
instead O
immerses O
the O
viewer O
in O
a O
dark O
and O
silent O
slide O
made O
up O
only O
of O
intimate O
words O
, O
thus O
leaving O
the O
viewer O
at O
the O
center O

the O
artistic O
event O

The O
Asteria B-ORG

has O
been O
part O

been O
present O

for O

in O

Then O
there O

the O

we O
have O

especially O
between O
1400 O
and O
1700 O
, O
because O
of O
the O
fear O
of O
the O
Turks O
who O
were O
pushing O
at O
the O
borders O
of O
Catholic O
Europe B-LOC
. O
" O

And O
from O
the O
Muslim O
world O
's O
point O
of O
view O
, O
how O
has O
this O
relationship O
been O
lived O
? O

" O
Islam O
also O
developed O
an O
ideology O
of O
confrontation O
, O
completely O
speculative O
, O
after O
its O
contact O
with O
the O
West O
. O

He O
felt O
threatened O
by O
the O
crusades O
, O
by O
colonialism O
, O
and O
then O
by O
the O
support O
given O
to O
Israel B-LOC
, O
and O
he O
rekindled O
the O
hostility O
towards O
Europe B-LOC
, O
which O
has O
never O
been O
lasting O
. O

And O
just O
like O
in O
the O
West O
, O
the O
idea O
developed O
that O
there O
was O
a O
global O
conflict O
going O
on O
. O

But O
all O
of O
this O
falls O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
what O
we O
might O
call O
small O
- O
scale O
and O
large O
- O
scale O
optical O
phenomena O
. O

Astigmatism O
, O
myopia O
, O
pre O
- O
eclampsia O
-- O
the O
inability O
to O
see O
things O
in O
their O
right O
proportions O
. O

Europeans O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
also O
fought O
each O
other O
for O
religious O
reasons O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
Islamists O
and O
Westerners O
will O
never O
reach O
the O
level O
of O
hatred O
and O
violence O
that O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
religious O
wars O
of O
the O
1400s O
and O
1500s O
in O
Europe B-LOC
reached O
. O

And O
yet O
they O
have O
not O
stopped O
us O
from O
creating O
a O
common O
European O
consciousness O
. O
" O

So O
how O
do O
you O
consider O
the O
failed O
attempt O
by O
some O
part O
of O
the O
Italian O
political O
world O
to O
get O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
Christian O
origins O
of O
Europe O
in O
the O
European O
Constitution O
? O

" O
When O
you O
talk O
about O
cultural O
roots O
, O
you O
have O
to O
resist O
the O
simplistic O
, O
integrative O
temptation O
of O
aut O
aut O
, O
because O
cultures O
tend O
to O
develop O
on O
et O
et O
et O
, O
the O
coexistence O
of O
different O
traditions O
. O

It O
's O
clear O
that O
Europe B-LOC
has O
Christian O
roots O
, O
but O
these O
, O
as O
we O
've O
seen O
, O
are O
not O
suns O
. O
" O

The O
crusades O
began O
at O
a O
time O
of O
crisis O
in O
Christianity O
, O
cultural O
crisis O
and O
economic O
crisis O
. O

looks O
like O
the O
situation O
in O
the O
Arab O
countries O
today O
. O

Is O
Islam O
a O
backwards O
crusade O
? O

" O
No O
. O

In O
modern O
Islam O
, O
there O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
process O
, O
very O
limited O
in O
both O
qualitative O
and O
quantitative O
terms O
, O
of O
degeneration O
, O
which O
has O
its O
roots O
and O
its O
meanings O
in O
the O
West O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
latest O
developments O
in O
globalization O
that O
accentuate O
and O
highlight O
all O
the O
enormous O
disparities O
between O
the O
West O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O
some O
parts O
of O
the O
Islamic O
world O
have O
identified O
in O
the O
development O
of O
the O
rich O
countries O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
Muslim O
decadence O
. O

So O
it O
started O
from O
a O
historically O
true O
fact O
, O
but O
it O
's O
being O
used O
cleverly O
to O
justify O
the O
need O
for O
sacred O
war O
. O
" O

What O
are O
our O
responsibilities O
in O
this O
? O

" O
European O
culture O
today O
is O
in O
the O
grips O
of O
dangerous O
schizophrenia O
. O

We O
've O
built O
our O
identity O
for O
at O
least O
three O
centuries O
on O
values O
such O
as O
equality O
, O
freedom O
and O
social O
justice O
that O
we O
continue O
to O
disregard O
in O
our O
dealings O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

And O
so O
the O
fundamentalist O
reaction O
is O
also O
a O
reaction O
to O
the O
disillusionment O
caused O
by O
Muslim O
countries O
with O
their O
contact O
with O
the O
West O
, O
which O
first O
promised O
independence O
and O
development O
and O
then O
rejected O
everything O
. O
" O

But O
why O
is O
it O
that O
religion O
has O
become O
the O
vehicle O
of O
this O
conflict O
? O

" O
Because O
religious O
discourse O
takes O
hold O
in O
an O
Islamic O
world O
of O
one O
billion O
three O
hundred O
million O
people O
who O
are O
part O
of O
that O
80 O
percent O
of O
the O
world O
's O
population O
living O
in O
poverty O
. O
" O

Now O
, O
given O
this O
element O
of O
massive O
injustice O
, O
what O
kind O
of O
language O
could O
a O
potential O
political O
agitator O
choose O
to O
use O
to O
attack O
consciousness O
? O

It O
's O
the O
religious O
language O
in O
the O
Western O
world O
that O
spells O
out O
" O
Jewish O
-- O
Christian O
-- O
atheist O
, O
" O
the O
great O
saint O
of O
all O
guilt O
. O
" O

Where O
does O
integrativeness O
come O
from O
? O

" O
The O
Islamic O
fundamentalist O
movement O
is O
a O
new O
movement O
born O
in O
the O
1920s O
as O
a O
shortcut O
to O
the O
violence O
of O
the O
Western O
expansion O
. O

There O
's O
a O
rediscovery O
of O
religious O
values O
, O
paradoxically O
lived O
in O
a O
very O
Western O
, O
ideological O
way O
. O

it O
's O
the O
image O
of O
an O
Islamist O
in O
war O
who O
has O
to O
win O
against O
the O
Western O
saint O
who O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
traditional O
one O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
despite O
the O
efforts O
that O
we O
make O
with O
our O
choices O
to O
promote O
fundamentalism O
, O
there O
are O
very O
few O
Muslims O
who O
adhere O
to O
it O
, O
which O
is O
why O
I O
believe O
that O
integralism O
will O
never O
develop O
any O
further O
. O
" O

And O
yet O
the O
attacks O
continue O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
increasing O
the O
intensity O
of O
the O
violence O
-- O

" O
But O
that O
's O
exactly O
why O
terrorist O
movements O
are O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
dangerous O
. O

because O
they O
realize O
that O
their O
area O
of O
development O
is O
very O
limited O
, O
and O
then O
they O
curb O
their O
practice O
. O

That O
's O
where O
the O
Beslan B-LOC
tragedy O
comes O
from O
. O
" O

Let O
's O
explore O
the O
opposite O
field O
, O
the O
Western O
field O
. O

Is O
n't O
the O
war O
against O
terrorism O
about O
to O
have O
all O
the O
characteristics O
of O
a O
politically O
and O
religiously O
integrated O
crusade O
? O

" O
There O
is O
one O
thing O
, O
for O
example O
, O
about O
Bush B-PER
and O
his O
clique O
, O
that O
if O
I O
was O
n't O
a O
believer O
, O
I O
would O
call O
it O
fanatical O
religious O
inversion O
. O

Now O
I O
'm O
a O
practicing O
Catholic O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
talk O
about O
religious O
involuntaryness O
, O
but O
there O
's O
a O
kind O
of O
resurgence O
of O
the O
relationship O
between O
religion O
and O
politics O
. O

When O
I O
see O
images O
of O
Americans O
praying O
at O
Ground O
Zero O
, O
I O
rely O
on O
mass O
media O
coverage O
and O
the O
power O
of O
fanatical O
ideological O
apparatus O
. O

Pulling O
everyone O
together O
in O
front O
of O
the O
television O
aloud O
is O
not O
my O
way O
of O
thinking O
about O
religion O
. O

In O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
there O
's O
an O
old O
fundamentalist O
Protestant O
root O
, O
linked O
to O
what O
they O
call O
the O
nation O
's O
" O
manifesto O
destiny O
. O
" O

Is O
religion O
all O
this O
? O

It O
's O
a O
political O
view O
of O
faith O
. O

Does O
it O
mean O
a O
spirit O
of O
crossing O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
exists O
in O
Islamic O
Jihad O
, O
but O
also O
in O
today O
's O
Western O
world O
. O
" O

How O
do O
we O
get O
out O
of O
this O
vicious O
cycle O
? O

Is O
that O
possible O
? O

" O
Not O
right O
now O
. O

The O
only O
way O
is O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
manic O
view O
that O
the O
media O
gives O
us O
, O
inherited O
from O
politicians O
and O
powerful O
powers O
, O
of O
a O
world O
divided O
between O
good O
and O
evil O
. O

We O
need O
to O
respond O
like O
they O
did O
in O
France B-LOC
after O
the O
kidnapping O
of O
journalists O
. O

As O
a O
right O
- O
wing O
man O
and O
as O
a O
European O
citizen O
, O
I O
've O
been O
proud O
of O
the O
sense O
of O
national O
unity O

of O
compassion O
I O
've O
seen O
expressed O
to O
the O
French O

" O

In O
what O
sense O
? O

" O
They O
did O
n't O
give O
up O

to O
the O
kidnappers O
asking O
for O
the O
abolition O
of O
the O
veil O
law O
in O
a O
unified O
way O

from O
right O

left O

this O

the O

Muslim O
community O

contrary O
to O

at O
the O

time O

France B-LOC

not O

aligned O

has O
a O
different O
idea O
of O
what O
should O
be O
done O

the O
role O
of O

logic O

from O

what O

one O
of O

The O
importance O
of O

emphasized O

curator O

, O
art O
critic O
Pier B-PER
Luigi I-PER
Tazzi I-PER
, O
who O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
goal O
of O
the O
initiative O
is O
to O
" O
reduce O
the O
schizophrenic O
divide O
between O

doer O

The O
future O

" O

have O

freedom O

" O
All O
the O
work O

this O
group O

Danish O
artists O

" O
the O
curator O
explains O
, O
" O
can O
only O
work O
if O
you O
lower O
the O
barrier O

does O
it O

" O
We O
talked O

who O
had O
suggested O
moving O

the O
problem O
was O
to O
find O
a O

in O
Trento B-LOC

would O
accommodate O
it O
all O
. O

Getting O
around O

The O
next O
day O
, O
the O
first O
accident O
involving O
a O
cyclist O
. O

At O
the O
intersection O
of O
Via B-LOC
Vittorio I-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
and O
Via B-LOC
Lorenzoni I-LOC
. O

on O
the O
sidewalks O
, O
it O
was O
knocked O
down O
by O
a O
car O
that O
was O
passing O
through O
the O
now O
- O
famous O
freeway O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
there O
were O
no O
serious O
consequences O
. O

The O
man O
had O
a O
head O
injury O
, O
but O
he O
never O
lost O
consciousness O
, O
and O
he O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
hospital O
by O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
for O
identification O
. O

But O
the O
incident O
raises O
a O
series O
of O
questions O
about O
the O
micro O
, O
and O
the O
macro O
, O
the O
politics O
for O
cyclists O
in O
the O
City B-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC

As O
far O
as O
the O
Veneto B-LOC
road I-LOC
is O
concerned O
, O
the O
bike O
lane O
soap O
opera O
is O
in O
its O
final O
stages O
, O
the O
deepening O
stages O
. O

Launched O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
track O
occupies O
half O
the O
sidewalk O
, O
forcing O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
to O
live O
in O
an O
impossible O
environment O
. O

It O
's O
actually O
not O
even O
a O
bike O
lane O
. O

It O
's O
just O
a O
white O
strip O
of O
paint O
. O

The O
bike O
lane O
on O
the O
Veneto B-LOC
road O
has O
always O
been O
a O
colossal O
mess O
. O

dangerous O
to O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
, O
ends O
up O
in O
the O
wilderness O
. O

At O
the O
intersection O
of O
Mattioli B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
it O
goes O
straight O
to O
the O
new O
ice O
shelves O
. O

In O
some O
sections O
, O
it O
's O
less O
than O
a O
foot O
long O
, O
which O
is O
enough O
for O
two O
- O
way O
cyclists O
. O

If O
the O
Public B-ORG
Works O
Inspectorate I-ORG
applies O
the O
Code O
of O
Conduct O
, O
it O
should O
file O
a O
complaint O
with O
the O
City B-LOC
Council O
. O

Just O
look O
a O
few O
kilometers O
from O
here O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
mean O
Bolzano B-LOC
, O
I O
mean O
Rovereto B-LOC
-- O
and O
you O
'll O
notice O
two O
things O
. O

bike O
lanes O
are O
separated O
from O
pedestrian O
circulation O
; O

and O
they O
're O
marked O
with O
red O
asphalt O
. O

And O
here O
the O
problem O
is O
more O
general O
, O
that O
of O
the O
policy O
of O
this O
city O
for O
cyclists O
. O

I O
remember O
vividly O
a O
1986 O
press O
conference O
in O
which O
the O
commissioner O
Roberto B-PER
De I-PER
Bernardis I-PER
, O
on O
a O
bicycle O
regulator O
's O
couch O
, O
convened O
the O
press O
to O
the O
Mariner O
to O
explain O
that O
the O
railroad O
would O
have O
, O
by O
1994 O
, O
" O
an O
efficient O
network O
of O
north O
- O
south O
and O
south O
- O
facing O
bike O
lanes O
in O
the O
historic O
center O
. O
" O

Dance O
. O

They O
've O
been O
fooling O
us O
for O
years O
. O

As O
cyclists O
, O
as O
we O
try O
to O
fight O
smog O
and O
take O
charge O
of O
safer O
and O
more O
ecological O
mobility O
, O
we O
are O
sacrificed O
on O
the O
engine O
bay O
. O

When O
we O
do O
n't O
get O
knocked O
down O
on O
our O
cycle O
lanes O
-- O
pedestrians O
like O
the O
killer O
yesterday O
. O

But O
you O
know O
, O
Trent B-LOC
is O
" O
2004 O
Alpine O
City O
. O
" O

That O
means O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
. O

But O
in O
fact O
, O
music O
is O
always O
the O
same O
. O

on O
two O
wheels O
, O
risking O
your O
skin O
. O

And O
they O
take O
you O
around O
too O
