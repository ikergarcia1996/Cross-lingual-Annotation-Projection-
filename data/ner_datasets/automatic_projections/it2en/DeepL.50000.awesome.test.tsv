Zapatero B-PER

Zapatero B-PER

obtained O
last O

an O
authorization O

after O
going O

Zapatero B-PER

Italians O

differ O

the O

Calipari B-PER

who O
fired O
the O

did O
not O
make O
any O

will O
not O
be O
punished O

they O

It O
remains O

, O
open O
the O
possibility O

The O

It O
is O
even O
less O
- O
added O
Sgrena B-PER

than O
what O
I O
expected O

because O
at O
the O

the O
versions O
given O
by O
the O

were O
those O
of O
an O

Now O
, O
instead O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
even O
talk O
about O

it O
seems O

Lozano B-PER
, O
the O
Report O
notes O
, O
had O
multiple O
tasks O
: O

He O
was O
to O
remain O
in O
the O
turret O
, O
facing O
north O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
top O
of O
the O
ramp O
toward O
incoming O
traffic O
. O

From O
there O
, O
he O
was O
to O
operate O
a O
high O
- O
powered O
manual O
flashlight O
with O
three O
million O
candles O
, O
which O
he O
was O
to O
light O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
approaching O
vehicles O
. O

If O
the O
light O
signals O
were O
ineffective O
, O
he O
would O
have O
to O
fire O
warning O
shots O
aimed O
at O
the O
left O
of O
the O
vehicle O
traveling O
down O
the O
ramp O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
if O
the O
vehicle O
continued O
to O
approach O
, O
he O
would O
realign O
the O
weapon O
and O
use O
it O
to O
disable O
the O
vehicle O
, O
targeting O
the O
engine O
and O
wheels O
. O

Finally O
, O
if O
the O
vehicle O
still O
did O
not O
stop O
, O
he O
would O
have O
to O
continue O
firing O
to O
engage O
the O
vehicle O

interior O
. O

Only O
5 O
days O

, O
the O
soldier O
had O
been O
retrained O

the O
use O
of O

That O
evening O
, O
therefore O
, O
Lozano B-PER
was O
in O
the O
turret O
when O
the O
Toyota O
Corolla O
driven O
by O
Carpani B-PER
approached O
the O
checkpoint O
at O
a O
speed O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
various O
testimonies O
of O
the O
American O
soldiers O
, O
ranged O
from O
50 O
to O
80 O
miles O
per O
hour O
. O

These O
testimonies O
, O
the O
report O
points O
out O
, O
" O
seem O
to O
be O
spoiled O
by O
emotional O
factors O
" O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
gunner O
" O
felt O
threatened O
and O
said O
he O
thought O
of O
his O
daughters O
while O
frantically O
counting O
the O
seconds O
, O
observed O
the O
space O
covered O
by O
the O
car O
, O
performed O
the O
mathematical O
operations O
necessary O
to O
calculate O
the O
speed O
of O
the O
vehicle O
that O
is O
approaching O
inexorably O
, O
screamed O
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
lungs O
, O
but O
no O
other O
soldier O
heard O
the O
screams O
shouted O
to O
be O
heard O
by O
the O
driver O
of O
the O
Toyota O
, O
He O
fired O
warning O
shots O
with O
his O
right O
hand O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
lawn O
on O
his O
left O
, O
threw O
away O
the O
lamp O
while O
changing O
the O
lighting O
conditions O
of O
the O
ramp O
with O
both O
hands O
, O
turned O
it O
towards O
the O
car O
now O
arrived O
at O
a O
distance O
too O
close O
for O
a O
suspected O
car O
bomb O
, O
aimed O
and O
fired O
ahead O
of O
the O
car O
to O
try O
to O
hit O

engine O

All O
this O
- O
it O
is O
noted O
- O
in O
a O
handful O
of O
seconds O
" O
. O

And O
so O
the O
gunner O
fired O
" O
at O

two O
close O
bursts O
" O
. O

The O
11 O
7.62 O

So O
the O

Giancarlo B-PER
Tarquini I-PER

yesterday O
outlined O
the O
scenario O

death O

21 O

slit O
his O
throat O
between O

An O
execution O
decided O
to O
punish O
the O
girl O
for O
her O
choice O
to O
live O
in O
the O
West O
, O
rebelling O
against O
the O
rigid O
impositions O
of O
tradition O
and O
the O
wishes O
of O
her O
father O
, O
who O
had O
already O
arranged O
a O
marriage O
for O
her O
in O
Pakistan B-LOC

" O
We O
hope O
to O
catch O
soon O
the O
third O
of O
Hina B-PER
's O
murderers O
, O
" O
said O
the O
magistrate O
. O

The O
heinous O
crime O
, O
said O
Tarquini B-PER
, O
" O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
punishment O
inflicted O
by O
the O
father O
to O
a O
daughter O
who O
had O
not O
respected O
the O
rules O
of O
ethnicity O
and O
Pakistani O
culture O
. O

These O
are O
cruelties O
that O
sometimes O
arise O
from O
religious O
beliefs O
or O
convictions O
that O
should O
lead O
to O
anything O
but O
, O
that O
is O
, O
respect O
for O
life O
. O

" O
I O
think O
that O
the O
Muslim O
religion O
also O
leads O
to O
respect O
for O
life O
, O
and O
not O
all O
' O
opposite O
- O
said O
the O
magistrate O
- O
. O

Those O
who O
commit O
crimes O
in O
the O
name O
of O
religion O
violate O
the O
religion O
itself O
and O
its O
guiding O
principles O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
not O
Islam O
that O
caused O
this O
tragedy O
. O

However O
, O
its O
incorrect O
reading O
has O
turned O
into O
an O
aberration O
. O

According O
to O
the O
prosecutor O
, O
Hina B-PER
's O
killers O
are O
her O
father O
Mohamed B-PER
Saleem I-PER
, O
51 O
, O
her O
uncle O
Mohamad B-PER
Tariq I-PER
, O
50 O
( O
husband O
of O
her O
mother O
's O
sister O
) O
and O
possibly O
the O
young O
husband O
of O
Hina B-PER
's O
older O
sister O
. O

To O
cut O
the O
throat O
of O
Hina B-PER
would O
have O
been O
the O
father O
, O
with O
the O
full O
cooperation O
of O
the O
other O
two O
. O

For O
this O
the O
accusation O
is O
identical O
for O
all O
: O

premeditated O
voluntary O
homicide O
and O
concealment O
of O
a O
corpse O
. O

The O
prosecutor O
dwelt O
at O
length O
on O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
premeditation O
: O

It O
is O
assumed O
that O
the O
girl O
had O
been O
invited O
home O
with O
the O
' O
deception O
and O
that O
the O
mother O
and O
brothers O
removed O
in O
order O
to O
act O
undisturbed O
. O

Between O
the O
young O
girl O
and O
her O
father O
the O
relationship O
was O
not O
good O
for O
years O
. O

He O
could O
not O
stand O
that O
the O
girl O
dressed O
all O
' O
western O
, O
working O
in O
the O
evening O
( O
in O
a O
bar O
in O
Brescia B-LOC
) O
and O
went O
to O
clubs O
and O
places O
of O
entertainment O
frequented O
by O
Italians O
. O

Hina B-PER
had O
westernized O
herself O
to O
all O
effects O
: O

She O
also O
had O
two O
tattoos O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
she O
did O
not O
want O
to O
know O
about O
a O
marriage O
already O
arranged O
for O
her O
by O
her O
father O
in O
Pakistan B-LOC

It O
remains O
to O
be O
understood O
if O
and O
how O
much O
Saleem B-PER
knew O
about O
his O
daughter O
's O
relationship O
with O
Giuseppe B-PER
Tampini I-PER
, O
the O
33 O
years O
old O
bricklayer O
with O
whom O
the O
girl O
had O
been O
living O
for O
over O
a O
year O
. O

Since O
the O
day O
of O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
girl O

body O
, O
last O
Saturday O
, O
the O
young O

out O

The O
heinous O

According O

the O

Giuliano B-PER

, O
" O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Pakistani O
girl O
killed O
by O
her O
father O
teaches O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
purposes O

because O
it O
is O
clear O

not O
enough O
to O
ask O

the O
' O
adherence O

It O

as O
the O

The O
minister O
then O
added O
that O
a O
right O
to O

universal O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
" O

explains O
that O

the O

Two O
facts O
that O
are O
intertwined O
in O
these O

could O
produce O
strong O
political O
consequences O
: O

Today O
's O
municipal O
elections O
in O
Catania B-LOC
and O
the O
economic O
situation O
, O
which O
not O
even O
the O
governmental O
Istat B-ORG
in O
recent O
days O
has O
managed O
to O
hide O
, O
having O
to O
admit O
that O
we O
are O
now O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
dramatic O
recession O
. O

Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
has O
tried O
to O
reassure O
everyone O
that O
the O
current O
one O
is O
not O
a O
real O
recession O
because O
there O
are O
other O
indicators O
that O
instead O
demonstrate O
the O
tightness O
of O
the O
economy O
. O

But O
they O
are O
indicators O
that O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
south O
, O
are O
taken O
as O
a O
joke O
, O
such O
as O
the O
calculation O
of O
employment O
, O
because O
the O
real O
Italian O
drama O
is O
the O
collapse O
of O
' O
industry O
and O
in O
particular O
of O
large O
and O
heavy O
industry O
. O

Tormented O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
by O
the O
sirens O
of O
the O
" O
new O
economy O
" O
and O
on O
the O
other O
by O
the O
uncritical O
exaltation O
of O
finance O
and O
the O
stock B-ORG
market O
, O
we O
have O
forgotten O
that O
this O
country O
had O
become O
a O
world O
power O
because O
big O
industry O
had O
produced O
wealth O
, O
jobs O
and O
prestige O
. O

We O
let O
ourselves O
be O
dazzled O
by O
four O
designer O
clothes O
and O
by O
the O
speculative O
" O
bubbles O
" O
that O
can O
produce O
ephemeral O
images O
and O
some O
immediate O
results O
, O
but O
certainly O
not O
jobs O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
today O
the O
municipal O
elections O
in O
Catania B-LOC
could O
be O
marked O
by O
the O
crisis O
, O
because O
after O
four O
years O
of O
Berlusconism O
we O
do O
not O
understand O
where O
is O
the O
revival O
of O
the O
economy O
. O

Only O
now O
, O
after O
four O
years O
, O
the O
premier O
has O
begun O
to O
talk O
about O
cuts O
to O
Irap O
, O
that O
is O
, O
taxes O
on O
labor O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
always O
remains O
: O

Where O
does O
he O
find O
the O
money O
for O
the O
budget O
? O

The O
era O
of O
the O
announcements O
is O
over O
. O

And O
if O
in O
Catania B-LOC
will O
not O
win O
the O
outgoing O
mayor O
and O
personal O
doctor O
of O
Berlusconi B-PER
, O
that O
Scapagnini B-PER
so O
attentive O
to O
beauty O
, O
there O
is O
the O
risk O
of O
opening O
for O
the O
government O
another O
political O
crisis O
. O

The O
serious O
risk O
that O
this O
happens O
is O
there O
, O
given O
the O
situation O
. O

Fini B-PER
and O
Follini B-PER
at O
that O
point O
will O
pose O
problems O
, O
making O
real O
the O
possibility O
that O

ROME B-LOC
- O
A O
campaign O
of O
' O
attack O
against O
the O
left O
, O
even O
harder O
than O
that O
of O
2001 O
: O

Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
proposes O
to O
his O
allies O
his O
eternal O
recipe O
to O
defeat O
Prodi B-PER
and O
remain O
in O
government O
in O
the O
new O
legislature O
. O

His O
political O
analysis O
is O
simple O
: O

Italians O
are O
a O
people O
of O
moderates O
, O
they O
will O
not O
hand O
over O
the O
keys O
to O
power O
to O
a O
coalition O
that O
does O
not O
have O
the O
shred O
of O
a O
program O
. O

At O
the O
regional O
Cdl B-ORG
has O
lost O
for O
the O
' O
absenteeism O
of O
the O
disappointed O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
realizes O
that O
new O
things O
are O
needed O
and O
the O
announcement O
of O
a O
postponement O
of O
the O
single O
party O
does O
not O
reassure O
the O
disgruntled O
, O
Udc B-ORG
and O
An B-ORG
in O
primis O
. O

We O
will O
see O
today O
how O
the O
latest O
moves O
of O
the O
Knight O
will O
be O
evaluated O
at O
the O
Udc B-ORG
congress O
and O
all O
' O
national O
assembly O
of O
An B-ORG
: O

The O
impression O
is O
that O
the O
allies O
are O
folded O
on O
themselves O
, O
looking O
for O
an O
electoral O
strategy O
. O

It O
is O
no O
coincidence O
that O
Alemanno B-PER
asks O
that O
An B-ORG
holds O
a O
programmatic O
conference O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
" O
new O
Fiuggi O
" O
, O
as O
a O
condition O
for O
not O
giving O
life O
to O
an O
internal O
minority O
( O
and O
it O
would O
be O
the O
first O
time O
that O
Fini B-PER
would O
not O
get O
unanimity O
in O
his O
party O
) O
. O

In O
the O
Udc B-ORG
maybe O
Giovanardi B-PER
will O
not O
compete O
with O
Follini B-PER
also O
because O
the O
projection O
of O
the O
unique O
party O
beyond O
the O
2006 O
politics O
makes O
a O
congressional O
battle O
so O
premature O
quite O
surreal O
. O

But O
Berlusconi B-PER
must O
also O
deal O
with O
two O
other O
problems O
: O

The O
League B-ORG
and O
the O
socialists B-ORG
. O

The O
first O
, O
as O
Bondi B-PER
recognizes O
, O
remains O
for O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
" O
a O
vital O
anchorage O
" O
and O
this O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
single O
party O
can O
not O
turn O
into O
a O
path O
against O
Bossi B-PER
: O

So O
it O
needs O
a O
softer O
approach O
. O

As O
for O
the O
socialists O
, O
yesterday O
's O
meeting O
between O
De B-PER
Michelis I-PER
and O
Boselli B-PER
represented O
a O
step O
forward O
on O
the O
road O
to O
socialist O
unity O
. O

Although O
with O
all O
due O
caution O
, O
the O
New B-ORG
Psi I-ORG
seems O
to O
be O
on O
the O
way O
to O
leaving O
the O
CDL B-ORG
, O
also O
because O
of O
the O
impossibility O
of O
recognizing O
itself O
in O
a O
single O
party O
inspired O
by O
the O
EPC B-ORG
. O

Of O
course O
, O
De B-PER
Michelis I-PER
continues O
to O
repeat O
that O
the O
operation O
must O
remain O
outside O
the O
" O
schemes O
in O
force O
" O
, O
but O
once O
the O
Fed B-ORG
is O
over O
, O
socialist O
unity O
seems O
possible O
only O
within O
the O
center O
- O
left O
. O

Boselli B-PER
speaks O
of O
encouraging O
talks O
and O
does O
not O
exclude O
a O
subsequent O
enlargement O
of O
the O
agreement O
to O
the O
radicals B-ORG
. O

Against O
the O
risk O
of O
a O
haemorrhage O
of O
the O
socialist O
area O
, O
Berlusconi B-PER
has O
announced O
that O
he O
will O
nominate O
Stefania B-PER
Craxi I-PER
in O
a O
safe O
constituency O
of O
Milan B-LOC
. O

Letizia B-PER
Moratti I-PER
instead O
will O
run O
for O
the O

. O

The O
real O
reformist O
socialists O
, O
argues O
the O
Knight O
, O
can O
not O
forget O
what O
the O
left O
has O
done O
to O
Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER

But O
the O
vice O

Caldoro B-PER
replies O
dryly O
that O

ROME B-LOC
- O
Four O
days O
after O

a O
strong O
appeal O
for O
dialogue O

been O
addressed O
to O
the O
two O
poles O
by O
the O
President O

Giorgio B-PER
Napolitano I-PER

During O
his O
visit O
to O
Naples B-LOC
, O
the O
Head O
of O
State O
has O
invited O
voters O
to O
go O
to O
the O
polls O
because O
" O
too O
important O
is O
the O
matter O
on O
which O
each O
is O
called O
to O
pronounce O
, O
however O
you O
think O

But O
Napolitano B-PER
also O
asked O
the O
two O
opposing O
parties O
, O
" O
whatever O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O

" O
, O
to O
bring O

" O
in O
search O
of O
the O

consensus O

The O
appeal O
is O
supported O
by O
both O
sides O
; O

Especially O
from O
the O
center O
- O
right O
, O
which O
judges O
it O
particularly O
positive O

it O
is O
accompanied O

' O
another O

" O

all O

But O
the O
clash O
between O
the O
two O
poles O
remains O
high O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
umpteenth O
long O

distance O
duel O
between O
Berlusconi B-PER

The O
Cdl B-ORG

his O
broadside O
from O
the O
Gr O
of O

The O

says O

" O

from O

almost O
an O

Even O
Roberto B-PER
Calderoli I-PER
, O
usually O
very O
hard O
on O
the O
Head O

, O
puts O
aside O
the O
controversy O
and O
says O
yes O
to O
dialogue O

On O
one O
condition O
, O
however O
: O

That O
the O

is O
approved O

comes O
into O
force O
immediately O
. O

" O
Once O
it O

we O
can O
discuss O
how O
to O
improve O
it O
" O
, O
is O
his O
position O
. O

The O
Union B-ORG
does O
n't O
like O
all O
this O
clapping O
of O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
center O

right O

Napolitano B-PER

it O
sees O
it O

brands O

attitude O

" O

But O
the O
signals O
show O
that O

beyond O

may O
become O
an O
element O

the O

A O

her O

a O
former O
deportee O

that O
concerned O
her O
not O
so O
much O

a O

rather O

When O

the O

The O

some O
asked O

his O

that O
of O

that O

that O

The O

" O

Two O

The O

CROTONE B-LOC
- O
There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
all O
the O
regions O
of O
Italy B-LOC
, O
those O
of O
the O
North O
and O
those O
of O
the O
South O
, O
are O
linked O
by O
a O
pact O
of O
national O
solidarity O
and O
that O
it O
is O
the O
duty O
of O
the O
central O
government O
to O
help O
the O
less O
favored O
regions O
of O
Southern O
Italy O
, O
especially O
to O
build O

. O

Carlo B-PER
Azeglio I-PER
Ciampi I-PER
wanted O
to O
reiterate O
this O
in O
Crotone B-LOC
, O
with O
a O
speech O
of O
institutional O
pedagogy O
that O
contains O
strong O
references O
to O
the O
duties O
of O
southern O
citizens O
and O
the O
spirit O
of O
responsibility O
that O
must O
inspire O
their O
administrators O
. O

The O
speech O
had O
as O
direct O
interlocutors O
also O
the O
numerous O
schoolchildren O
present O
on O
the O
stands O
of O
the O
sports O
hall O
where O
the O
Head O
of O
State O
took O
the O
floor O
, O
in O
front O
of O
an O
audience O
of O
mayors O
and O
councillors O
of O
the O
area O
. O

Ciampi B-PER
essentially O
asked O
young O
people O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
two O
things O
: O

of O
the O
" O
good O
fortune O
" O
of O
finally O
living O
in O
a O
Europe B-LOC
of O
peace O
and O
of O
the O
need O
to O
be O
creators O
of O
further O
progress O
. O

Because O
, O
he O
told O
them O
, O
the O
future O
will O
be O
that O
which O
you O
know O
how O
to O
build O
. O

Without O
ever O
mentioning O
the O
word O
federalism O
, O
Ciampi B-PER
affirmed O
: O

" O
The O
united O
Italy B-LOC
has O
the O
duty O
to O
dedicate O
special O
attention O
to O
the O
less O
developed O
regions O
because O
the O
country O
is O
one O
and O
its O
problems O
are O
everyone O
's O
problems O
to O
be O
solved O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
all O
. O

This O
, O
however O
, O
" O
does O
not O
mean O
neglecting O
the O
most O
advanced O
regions O
, O
which O
must O
be O
stimulated O
and O
supported O
in O
order O
to O
remain O
competitive O
on O
a O
global O
level O
" O
. O

" O
Italy B-LOC
, O
I O
repeat O
once O
again O
- O
he O
said O
- O
is O
one O
. O

Its O
problems O
, O
though O
different O
in O
the O
various O
areas O
, O
are O
everyone O
's O
problems O
and O
it O
is O
to O
everyone O
's O
advantage O
to O
solve O
each O
of O
them O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
right O
that O
the O
South O
relies O
on O
the O
richer O
North O
; O

that O
the O
central O
State O
carries O
out O
its O

that O

that O

making O
so O
really O
homage O
to O
the O
enterprise O
of O
Gaul B-PER
of O
June O

. O

On O
second O
thought O
- O
and O
not O
that O
we O
need O
to O
think O
about O
it O
too O
much O
- O
this O
is O
a O
solution O
dictated O
by O
common O
sense O
. O

Since O
for O
years O
everyone O
had O
been O
waiting O
for O
2006 O
for O
the O
reproposition O
of O
the O
hairpin O
bends O
from O
Montevideo B-LOC
to O
Vason B-LOC
, O
here O
is O
the O
time O
that O
Bondone B-LOC
really O
had O
to O
be O
, O
there O
was O
no O
sense O
in O
any O
other O
solution O
. O

But O
to O
make O
it O
go O
through O
has O
not O
been O
easy O
, O
because O
by O
now O
in O
Milan B-LOC
the O
idea O
that O
circulated O
, O
just O
one O
week O
after O
the O
vernissage O
of O
presentation O
of O
the O
track O
, O
was O
the O
one O
that O
the O
Province B-LOC
had O
already O
confirmed O
: O

only O
a O
passage O
on O
the O
summit O
and O
a O
dive O
towards O
the O
chief O
town O
, O
a O
hypothesis O
that O
had O
understandably O
perplexed O
the O
insiders O
and O
literally O
made O
the O
" O
Bondoneri O
" O
furious O
, O
who O
after O
the O
burning O
discovery O
of O
a O
Bondone B-LOC
in O
a O
minor O
tone O
had O
even O
threatened O
to O
block O
the O
race O
during O
a O
stage O
that O
- O
in O
their O
opinion O
and O
not O
only O
theirs O
- O
would O
have O
offended O
the O
beloved O
mountain O
instead O
of O
honoring O
it O
. O

But O
all O
this O
is O
now O
part O
of O
a O
past O
that O
has O
been O
contradicted O
by O
the O
present O
. O

And O
Mellarini B-PER
snatched O
another O
great O
result O
: O

The O
pink O
caravan O
will O

but O
not O

these O
are O

only O

who O
was O
still O
an O

had O
thought O

we O
were O

Bortoli B-PER
has O
scored O
40 O
goals O
in O
two O

now O
he O
has O

Sundays O
because O
even O
yesterday O
( O
Sunday O
) O
he O
was O
only O
on O
the O

thanks O
to O
infiltrations O
. O

It O
is O
time O
and O
time O
that O
the O
most O
experienced O
players O
, O
even O
if O
the O
" O
oldest O
" O
are O
25 O
years O
old O
, O
take O
on O
their O
responsibilities O
; O

This O
year O
we O
are O
training O
even O
more O
intensely O
than O
last O
season O
, O
the O
training O
methods O
and O
the O
coach O
are O
always O
the O

Now O
finally O
we O
have O
recovered O
Matté B-PER

who O
can O
give O
quality O
on O
the O
sides O

more O
choice O
in O

In O
light O
of O
the O
many O
goals O
conceded O
recently O
, O
will O
you O
insist O
with O
the O
three O
- O
man O
defense O
or O
will O
you O
be O
more O
covered O
? O

" O
The O
defensive O
module O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
collect O
too O
many O
goals O
, O
at O
least O
in O
recent O
games O
, O
stems O
exclusively O
from O
individual O
mistakes O
, O
many O
goals O
we O
have O
honestly O
made O
us O
, O
with O
big O
gifts O
to O
opponents O
, O
not O
respecting O
deliveries O
and O
movements O

The O
promising O
Giuliani B-PER
when O
he O
plays O
is O
always O
good O
but O
does O
not O
play O
much O
, O
why O
? O

" O
Unfortunately O
, O
not O
his O
fault O
, O
he O
missed O
all O
the O
pre O
- O
season O
preparation O
for O
health O
problems O
. O

When O
he O
played O
against O
San B-ORG
Giorgio I-ORG
he O
played O
quite O
well O
but O
then O
in O
Stegona B-LOC
he O
was O
not O
confirmed O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
, O
with O
the O
return O
of O
Bortoli B-PER
and O
Garniga B-PER
, O
with O
Giovanazzi B-PER
in O
support O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
play O
Giuliani B-PER
but O
I O
always O
keep O
him O
in O
consideration O
. O

Will O
you O
ask O
the O
society O
to O
return O
to O

" O
Absolutely O
not O
, O
the O

has O
made O
a O
clear O
choice O
, O
shared O
by O
me O
: O

We O
will O
not O
go O
on O

, O
given O
the O
response O
of O
a O

after O
winning O
the O

No O

What O
we O
lack O

With O
three O

would O

As O

I O
say O
that O
this O
is O
fine O
, O
that O
it O
is O
right O
that O
Roma B-ORG
played O
the O
game O
until O
the O
last O
minute O
, O
that O
they O
celebrated O
. O

But O
then O
Pulvirenti B-PER
attacked O
Spalletti B-PER
: O

" O
Spalletti B-PER
felt O
in O
a O
dimension O
of O
demigod O
, O
when O
he O
will O
return O
to O
earth O
, O
as O
is O
inevitable O
to O
happen O
, O
he O
will O
realize O
certain O
things O

The O
pats O

the O
back O
? O

Pure O
hypocrisy O
, O
I O
have O
no O
other O
words O
. O

I O
liked O
more O
the O
Spalletti B-PER
that O
during O
the O
game O
asked O
his O
players O
to O
score O
goals O
, O
who O
inserted O
motivated O
players O
. O

So O
at O

there O
is O
consistency O

To O
take O
the O
three O
points O

fundamental O

Luca B-PER

does O

nor O
the O

nor O
the O

that O

And O
he O
explains O
it O
this O
way O
: O

" O
In O
the O
final O
I O
realized O
that O
Cunego B-PER
, O
who O
had O
made O
the O
team O
work O
all O
day O
, O
was O
no O
longer O
so O
brilliant O

He O
, O
in O
the O
final O
climb O

had O
always O
closed O
in O
first O
person O
all O
the O
shots O
of O
my O
companion O
Emanuele B-PER
Sella I-PER
and O
then O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
less O
reactive O
than O
usual O
. O

So O
I O
waited O
for O
the O
last O
bang O
of O
Sella B-PER
, O
the O
last O
closure O
of O
the O
Veronese O
, O
to O
leave O
in O
my O
turn O
on O
the O
counterattack O
. O

We O
were O
not O
more O
than O
300 O
meters O
from O
the O
arrival O
and O
I O
gave O
everything O
I O
had O
, O
also O
because O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
take O
advantage O
of O
this O
occasion O
Cunego B-PER
in O
an O
arrival O
like O
this O
I O
wo O
n't O
beat O
him O
anymore O

.... O

" O
To O
be O
honest O
, O
we O
only O
showed O
up O
in O
the O
final O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
stage O
we O
let O
Lampre B-ORG
work O
, O
also O
because O
in O
this O
Giro O
they O
are O
definitely O
the O
team O
to O
beat O
. O

You O
won O
the O
hardest O
stage O
, O
now O
the O
Giro O
is O
all O
downhill O
... O

" O
Easy O
. O

I O
won O
here O
and O
this O
makes O
me O
happy O
, O
but O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Giro O
there O
are O
still O
three O
stages O
left O
and O
so O
anything O
can O
still O
happen O
. O

Cunego B-PER
, O
at O
the O
end O
, O
is O
only O
6 O
" O
away O
, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
before O
going O
downhill O
. O
So O
we O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
before O
singing O
victory O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
in O
the O
ranking O
there O
are O
two O
of O
us O
, O
me O
and O
Sella B-PER
and O
, O
if O
we O
want O
, O
also O
Perez B-PER
Cuapio I-PER

so O
we O
'll O
see O
to O
combine O
some O
good O

reasoning O

Any O

my O

The O
problem O

how O
to O

He O
does O
not O
know O
the O
Solatrix B-ORG
case O
, O
but O
he O
does O
not O
shy O
away O
from O
a O
consideration O
. O

" O
The O
bottom O
line O
is O
to O
look O
at O
the O
expense O
, O
timing O
and O
quality O
of O
the O

that O

carried O
out O

If O

are O
exaggerated O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
low O
, O
there O
is O
something O
wrong O

But O
in O

The O
reason O
for O

It O

an O

Violante B-PER

But O
for O
the O

Berlusconi B-PER
attacks O

" O

even O
the O

insists O
that O

the O
testimony O

There O
are O
two O
scientific O
revolutions O
that O
have O
shaken O
the O
foundations O
of O
the O
second O
half O
of O
the O
last O
century O
: O

The O
first O
is O
that O
which O
brought O
the O
microchip O
into O
our O
daily O
lives O
, O
the O
second O
is O
that O
which O
allowed O
us O
to O
unlock O
the O
secrets O
of O
human O
DNA O
. O

It O
can O
be O
summarized O
in O
this O
way O
, O
with O
the O
words O
of O
Giuseppe B-PER
Dalla I-PER
Porta I-PER
, O
scientific O
director O
of O
Ifom B-ORG
, O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
agreement O
sealed O
yesterday O
between O
his O
institute O
, O
at O
the O
forefront O
in O
cancer O
research O
, O
and O
the O
Itc B-ORG
- I-ORG
Irst I-ORG
. O

A O
pact O
that O
will O
see O
bioinformatics O
and O
genomic O
medicine O
walking O
together O
on O
the O
road O
to O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
the O
onset O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
in O
developing O
increasingly O
individualized O
therapies O
, O
based O
on O
knowledge O
of O
the O
genetic O
heritage O
of O
each O
patient O
. O

The O
software O
developed O
by O
the O
Bioinformatics O
group O
of O
the O
Center B-ORG
for I-ORG
Scientific I-ORG
and I-ORG
Technological I-ORG
Research I-ORG
of O
Povo B-LOC
, O
was O
chosen O
among O
hundreds O
by O
Ifom B-ORG
, O
the O
Institute B-ORG
for I-ORG
Molecular I-ORG
Oncology I-ORG
, O
a O
branch O
of O
the O
Italian B-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
for I-ORG
Cancer I-ORG
Research I-ORG
. O

It O
is O
a O
software O
designed O
specifically O
to O
manage O
the O
mass O
of O
information O
produced O
by O
the O
observation O
technique O
called O
" O
Tissue O
microarray O
" O
, O
which O
allows O
researchers O
to O
analyze O
the O
results O
of O
the O
study O
. O
which O
allows O
researchers O
to O
simultaneously O
analyze O
hundreds O
of O
samples O
of O
organic O
tissue O
, O
arranged O
in O
a O
grid O
on O
a O
microscope O
slide O
. O

This O
method O
of O
study O
facilitates O
large O
- O
scale O
comparisons O
and O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
treatments O
, O
with O
great O
savings O
in O
cost O
, O
tissue O
and O
time O
compared O
to O
traditional O
methods O
in O
use O
in O
laboratories O
. O

It O
therefore O
improves O
the O
efficiency O
of O
biomedical O
research O
, O
including O
cancer O
research O
, O
but O
requires O
complex O
management O
systems O
and O
transmission O
of O
the O
data O
collected O
. O

This O
is O
what O
Irst B-ORG
researchers O
have O
been O
working O
on O
for O
the O
last O
five O
years O
, O
with O
the O
support O
of O
a O
125,000 O
euro O
grant O
from O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Health I-ORG
and O
another O
50,000 O
euro O
provided O
by O
Itc B-ORG
. O

The O
result O
is O
a O
cutting O

edge O
software O
, O
co O
- O
owned O
by O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
and O
the O

that O
has O
convinced O

will O
enjoy O
any O
improvement O
made O
by O
Ifom B-ORG
to O

, O
but O
above O
all O
to O
give O
life O

between O
the O
two O

Andrea B-PER
Zanotti I-PER
: O

" O
The O

One O
thing O
, O
however O
, O
is O
certain O
: O

The O
municipal O
group O
of O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
intends O
to O
make O
the O
devil O
to O
four O
to O
protest O

March O
31 O
, O
2006 O
. O

The O
" O
azzurri O
" O
are O
contrary O
because O
they O
consider O
it O
a O
useless O
measure O
, O
without O
sense O
. O

They O
sustain O
that O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
the O
costs O
and O
the O
returns O
it O
is O
an O
operation O
that O
does O
not O
stand O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
would O
create O
enormous O
inconveniences O
against O
a O
minimal O
benefit O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O

. O

One O
of O
the O
ideas O
that O
the O
six O
councilors O
of O

are O
studying O
is O
to O
organize O
a O
kind O
of O

in O
which O
the O
alternate O

plan O
will O
be O
implemented O

For O
next O

the O

is O
planning O
to O
hold O
a O
press O
conference O
and O
present O
the O
various O
initiatives O
on O
the O
subject O
. O

It O
will O
be O
necessary O
, O
however O
, O
to O
make O
citizens O
understand O
how O
a O
party O
that O
has O
long O
fought O
against O
the O
incinerator O
, O
even O
arguing O
its O
environmental O
danger O
, O
suddenly O
changes O
strategy O

Unless O

proposes O
even O
more O

THE O
STORY O

of O
UBALDO B-PER

Transferred O
in O
four O
and O
four O
eights O
from O
Lavis B-LOC
to O
San B-LOC
Candido I-LOC
and O
all O
for O
having O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
the O
wrong O
woman O
. O

This O
is O
the O
fate O
that O
befell O
a O
twenty O
- O
nine O
year O
old O
chosen O
carabiniere O
, O
originally O
from O
Puglia O
. O

L O
' O
Arma B-ORG
has O
notified O
the O
transfer O
last O
December O
6 O
. O

Official O
reason O
: O

Protection O
of O
his O
safety O
because O
the O
ex O
- O
partner O
of O
the O
woman O
, O
who O
lives O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
is O
a O
convicted O
criminal O
currently O
in O
prison O
. O

But O
according O
to O
the O
carabiniere O
it O
is O
only O
hypocrisy O
: O

" O
In O
Trentino B-LOC
I O
have O
always O
been O
well O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
to O
say O
to O
anyone O
. O

The O
Carabiniere B-ORG
wants O
to O
prevent O
my O
love O
story O
, O
but O
he O
wo O
n't O
succeed O
because O
true O
love O
has O
no O
obstacles O
. O

The O
carabiniere O
is O
from O
Puglia O
, O
but O
he O
has O
been O
serving O
in O
the O
province B-LOC
for O
many O
years O
. O

His O
troubles O
began O
in O
July O
last O
year O
: O

" O
In O
June O
I O
separated O
from O
my O
ex O
- O
wife O
and O
I O
met O
my O
current O
partner O
. O

In O
July O
the O
trouble O
started O
. O

A O
former O
flame O
of O
my O
partner O
, O
who O
has O
a O
bar O
in O
Cles B-LOC
, O
began O
to O
threaten O
to O
make O
me O
move O
. O

He O
said O
that O
he O
had O
connections O
in O
the O
Arma B-ORG
and O
that O
he O
would O
make O
me O
pay O
. O

He O
also O
threatened O
me O
and O
for O
this O
there O
is O
a O
proceeding O
against O
him O
before O
the O
Justice O
of O
the O
Peace O
of O
Cles B-LOC
. O

This O
person O
also O
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
calling O
my O
ex O
- O
wife O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
I O
had O
got O
involved O
with O
the O
ex O
- O
partner O
of O
a O
convicted O
criminal O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
give O
it O
too O
much O
weight O
, O
but O
then O
in O
November O
I O
received O
the O
' O
notice O
from O
the O
Regional O
Command O
that O
the O
procedure O
for O
the O
transfer O
had O
been O
initiated O
. O

This O
news O
surprised O
and O
saddened O
me O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
explanations O
and O
I O
was O
told O
that O
there O
was O
an O
anonymous O
complaint O
about O
my O
relationship O
with O
my O
current O
partner O
. O

The O
transfer O
was O
justified O
with O
the O
protection O
of O
my O
safety O
. O

As O
if O
the O
former O
partner O
of O
my O
cohabitant O
could O
hurt O
me O
. O

I O
explained O
that O
he O
is O
in O
prison O
, O
around O
Italy B-LOC
, O
and O
has O
no O
intention O
of O
harming O
me O
. O

What O
interests O
him O
is O
that O
his O
ex O
and O
the O
two O
children O
he O
had O
with O
her O
are O
well O
. O

And O
with O
me O
they O
are O
well O
. O

The O
Carabiniere O
's O
explanations O
, O
however O
, O
had O
no O
effect O
and O
the O
regional O
command O
transferred O
him O
as O
of O
December O
6th O
. O

The O
Carabiniere O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
challenge O
the O
decision O
through O
the O
lawyer O
Claudio B-PER
Tasin I-PER
. O

Yesterday O
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Tar B-ORG
of I-ORG
Trento I-ORG
, O
his O
request O
for O
suspension O
was O
discussed O
. O

The O
first O
results O
are O
expected O
today O
. O

The O
carabiniere O
is O
however O
convinced O
that O
his O
safety O
is O
not O
the O
real O
reason O
for O
the O
transfer O
: O

" O
They O
say O
that O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
I O
am O
in O
danger O
, O
but O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
if O
it O
were O
true O
, O
would O
be O
valid O
also O
for O
Alto B-LOC
Adige I-LOC
. O

If O
one O
wanted O
to O
hurt O
me O
, O
he O
could O
do O
it O
in O
Lavis B-LOC
or O
San B-LOC
Candido I-LOC
. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
Arma B-ORG
wants O
to O
boycott O
my O
love O
story O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
for O
what O
reason O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
a O
thousand O
times O
to O
figure O
it O
out O
, O
but O
I O
have O
n't O
succeeded O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
my O
relationship O
is O
not O
well O
seen O
because O
my O
partner O
in O
the O
past O
has O
been O
the O
cohabitant O
of O
a O
convicted O
criminal O
. O

Besides O
, O
they O
have O
not O
been O
married O
. O

They O
have O
no O
legal O
ties O
. O

What O
hurts O
me O
the O
most O
is O
that O
the O
Arma B-ORG
, O
which O
represents O
so O
much O
to O
me O
, O
listens O
more O
to O
an O
anonymous O
complaint O
than O
to O
my O
reasons O
and O
explanations O
. O

They O
want O
to O
prevent O
my O
love O
story O
, O
but O
they O
will O
not O
succeed O
. O

I O
have O
always O
behaved O
well O
and O
I O
have O
not O
violated O
any O
rule O
. O

The O
behavior O
is O
mirrored O
. O

My O
partner O
also O
has O
no O
criminal O
record O
and O
has O
never O
been O
involved O
in O
the O
affairs O
of O
her O
ex O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
explain O
this O
doggedness O
towards O
us O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
give O
up O
. O

At O
Christmas O
, O
a O
similar O
incident O
happened O

him O

the O

J.V. B-PER

It O
was O
distributed O
during O
a O
trip O
to O
Val B-LOC

Fiemme I-LOC
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
that O
he O
was O
the O
" O
pastry O

" O
. O

Emilian O
tourist O
acquitted O
for O
the O
cake O
to O
the O
hashish O

The O
cook O
who O
had O
baked O
the O
hashish O
cake O
remained O
unknown O
. O

And O
so O
the O
trial O
that O
yesterday O
in O
Trento B-LOC
saw O
the O
alleged O
hallucinogenic O
pastry O
chef O
accused O
closed O
with O
an O
acquittal O
. O

In O
trouble O
, O
that O
is O
in O
the O
dock O
, O
was O
finished O
a O
young O
tourist O
from O
Emilia O
. O

He O
was O
accused O
of O
having O
distributed O
hashish O
cake O
during O
a O
trip O
to O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

We O
imagine O
the O
scene O
: O

The O
Emilian O
group O
crossed O
in O
bus O
the O
Fiemme B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
. O

From O
the O
bags O
they O
jumped O
out O
libations O
of O
every O
type O
: O

Potato O
chips O
, O
pizzas O
and O
perhaps O
also O
coppe O
and O
culatelli O
. O

The O
young O
defendant O
comes O
forward O
with O
dessert O
: O

A O
chocolate O
cake O
reinforced O
by O
a O
sprinkling O
of O
Moroccan O
" O
chocolate O
" O
. O

A O
little O
scratch O
of O
" O
smoke O
" O
just O
to O
make O
the O
trip O
go O
by O
more O
quickly O
. O

The O
problems O
arrived O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
later O
, O
when O
the O
hashish O
entered O
the O
digestive O
system O
and O
two O
of O
the O
tourists O
became O
ill O
. O

It O
is O
not O
clear O
if O
they O
had O
eaten O
the O
cake O
knowing O
that O
it O
had O
been O
reinforced O
with O
Moroccan O
chocolate O
. O

What O
is O
certain O
is O
that O
the O
improvised O
pastry O
chef O
from O
Emilia O
found O
himself O
in O
trouble O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
however O
, O
the O
young O
man O
was O
acquitted O
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
pm O
Alessia B-PER
Silvi I-PER
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
that O
he O
had O
been O
the O
one O
to O
make O
the O
cake O
galeotta O
. O

The O
witnesses O
called O
to O
testify O
were O
not O
able O
to O
shed O
light O
on O
the O
matter O
and O
so O
the O
judge O
could O
not O
help O
but O
acquit O

accused O

The O
" O

is O
certainly O
not O
a O
way O
of O
dealing O
with O
the O
local O
powers O
of O
this O
provincial B-ORG
government I-ORG
. O

If O
anything O
, O
it O
is O
an O
ancient O
tradition O
of O
the O
Christian B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
that O
can O
still O
be O
found O
in O
certain O
circles O
of O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
party O
, O
as O
well O
as O
within O
the O
provincial O
government O
. O

But O
President O
Dellai B-PER
is O
not O
the O
man O
to O
rely O
on O
this O
type O
of O
administrative O
- O
political O
practice O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
more O
power O
should O
be O
given O
to O
the O
territorial O
ambit O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
provincial O
center O
. O

" O
And O
my O
reform O
- O
sustains O
Ottorino B-PER
Bressanini I-PER
, O
Ds B-ORG
, O
councillor O
for O
reforms O
- O
goes O
exactly O
in O
this O
direction O
. O
- O

Councillor O
Bressanini B-PER
, O
has O
the O
centre O
- O
left O
in O
this O
election O
campaign O
used O
the O
provincial O
machine O
to O
condition O
local O
powers O
? O

Did O
they O
or O
did O
they O
not O
promise O
to O
lower O
the O
" O
magnadóra O
" O
? O

No O
, O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
mayors O
arriving O
at O
the O
Province B-LOC
with O
their O
hats O
in O
their O
hands O
during O
this O
electoral O
campaign O
. O

If O
anything O
, O
this O
has O
been O
a O
long O
tradition O
that O
the O
Christian B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
have O
cultivated O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

And O
that O
, O
even O
though O
time O
has O
passed O
, O
has O
remained O
almost O
a O
matter O
of O
system O
. O

And O
it O
risks O
continuing O
as O
long O
as O
the O
center O
of O
power O
is O
unique O
. O

Too O
much O
power O
to O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
then O
? O

Sure O
, O
to O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

But O
I O
would O
n't O
say O
to O
the O
presidency O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
does O
very O
little O
in O
the O
way O
of O
patronage O
. O

He O
constitutes O
a O
soul O
of O
the O
DC B-ORG
that O
has O
distanced O
itself O
from O
that O
system O
. O

There O
are O
other O
souls O
, O
in O
that O
party O
and O
in O
the O
provincial O
administration O
, O
who O
tend O
to O
keep O
that O
tradition O
alive O
. O

However O
, O
if O
I O
concentrate O
power O
in O
a O
single O
center O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
clienteles O
are O
born O
, O
that O
pressure O
is O
put O
on O
the O
lower O
levels O
of O
the O
administration O
, O
that O
there O
is O
conditioning O
. O

Democracy O
is O
to O
bring O
power O
close O
to O
the O
citizen O
, O
to O
give O
him O
more O
possibilities O
to O
manage O
and O
condition O
it O
, O
to O
direct O
it O
. O

Bressanini B-PER
, O
you O
have O
studied O
and O
proposed O
an O
institutional O
reform O
that O
could O
have O
some O
effect O
on O
this O
system O
. O

My O
institutional O
reform O
wants O
to O
say O
just O
that O
: O

To O
bring O
the O
center O
of O
real O
power O
closer O
to O
the O
citizens O
, O
avoiding O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
the O
system O
of O
blackmail O
and O
retaliation O
. O

But O
to O
do O
so O
, O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
that O
the O
financial O
flows O
, O
many O
financial O
flows O
, O
from O
the O
Province B-LOC
arrive O
at O
the O
territorial O
areas O
" O
by O
law O
" O
, O
without O
political O
mediation O
. O
without O
political O
mediation O
. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
the O
reform O
provides O
for O
, O
in O
a O
much O
more O
important O
and O
significant O
way O
than O
now O
. O

I O
realize O
that O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
territories O
, O
areas O
, O
and O
methods O
of O
electing O
certain O
bodies O
. O

But O
the O
important O
discourse O
behind O
it O
is O
that O
of O
the O
exercise O
of O
power O
, O
which O
goes O
towards O
the O
territories O
. O

The O
micro O
dimensions O
of O
the O
municipalities O
do O
not O
give O
them O
the O
possibility O
of O
actually O
exercising O
power O
. O

Instead O
, O
with O
the O
territorial O
ambits O
that O
my O
reform O
foresees O
, O
there O
will O
be O
a O
real O
passage O
of O
power O
starting O
from O
what O
is O
now O
the O
absolute O
centrality O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

Does O
your O
reform O
take O
into O
consideration O
and O
establish O
, O
therefore O
, O
different O
financial O
competences O
? O

Of O
course O
it O
does O
. O

In O
Article O
7 O
there O
is O
a O
very O
detailed O
list O
, O
which O
establishes O
which O
competences O
remain O
with O
the O
Province B-LOC
and O
which O
are O
passed O
on O
to O
the O
valley O
communities O
. O

The O
most O
important O
ones O
are O
those O
of O
the O
territorial O
organization O
of O
town O
planning O
( O
a O
second O
degree O
power O
, O
of O
course O
, O
which O
must O
respect O
the O
guidelines O
defined O
in O
the O
provincial O
context O
) O
. O

But O
then O
also O
the O
territorial O
organization O
of O
the O
development O
planning O
of O
a O
community O
. O

Each O
community O
will O
have O
to O
ask O
itself O
and O
decide O
where O
it O
wants O
to O
go O
and O
how O
to O
get O
there O
. O

It O
should O
not O
be O
the O
Province B-LOC
that O
does O
this O
. O

The O
Province B-LOC
must O
only O
provide O
the O
financing O
. O

Someone O
has O
spoken O
of O
an O
uprising O
of O
shields O
, O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
citizens O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
valleys O
, O
against O
the O
blackmailing O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
magnadóra O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
think O
this O
is O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
last O
elections O
? O

I O
did O
n't O
notice O
this O
rising O
of O
shields O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
, O
as O
in O
the O
past O
, O
many O
citizens O
of O
Trentino O
voted O
differently O
in O
the O
political O
elections O
than O
in O
the O
local O
elections O
. O

The O
Left O
, O
for O
example O
, O
has O
always O
received O
more O
votes O
in O
national O
elections O
because O
it O
was O
an O
ideal O
vote O
. O

While O
at O
the O
provincial O
elections O
, O
the O
citizen O
's O
bad O
habit O
of O
voting O
for O
convenience O
was O
triggered O
, O
of O
voting O
with O
his O
hat O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

It O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
like O
the O
speech O
of O
the O
mayor O
of O
Fai B-LOC
who O
says O
he O
is O
center O
- O
right O
but O
has O
joined O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
in O
order O
to O
obtain O
supposed O
advantages O
in O
dealing O
with O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

That O
mayor O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
pain O
, O
his O
mentality O
is O
already O
clientelistic O
from O
the O
start O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
he O
is O
more O
guilty O
than O
those O
who O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
something O
really O
asks O
him O
. O

But O
it O
remains O
, O
however O
, O
extremely O
unfair O
and O
absolutely O
undemocratic O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
those O
in O
the O
Province B-LOC
who O
say O
they O
want O
to O
raise O
the O
price O
charged O
to O
mayors O
who O
have O
not O
voted O
well O
. O

It O
may O
be O
that O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
over O
the O
years O
, O
has O
stimulated O
this O
kind O
of O
behavior O
. O

But O
the O
pansies O
do O
n't O
exist O
anymore O
, O
not O
even O
on O
the O
left O
. O

What O
I O
want O
to O
say O
is O
that O
the O
attitude O
of O
selling O
oneself O
to O
power O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
one O
does O
not O
feel O
oneself O
to O
be O
a O
citizen O
with O
rights O
but O
rather O
dependent O
on O
the O
magnadóra O
, O
is O
a O
historical O
habit O
of O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Trentino O
population O
. O

Will O
the O
institutional O
reform O
you O
are O
proposing O
succeed O
in O
breaking O
this O
tradition O
? O

It O
provides O
the O
territories O
with O
greater O
instruments O
of O
autonomy O
, O
but O
also O
more O
responsibilities O
for O
local O
administrators O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
however O
, O
my O
aspiration O
is O
to O
increase O
people O
's O
participation O
in O
public O
affairs O
. O

To O
widen O
the O
daily O
relationship O
of O
the O
citizen O
with O
power O
, O
today O
too O
scarce O
. O

We O
do O
not O
want O
to O
create O
a O
new O
class O
of O
administrators O
, O
but O
to O
spread O
power O
throughout O
society O
. O

Is O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
, O
in O
this O
sense O
, O
a O
good O
leader O
? O

Without O
him O
, O
Trentino O
democracy O
would O
be O
more O
backward O
. O

Although O
he O
should O
not O
be O
praised O
for O
this O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
he O
should O
not O
feel O
like O
an O
anointed O
one O
. O

" O
We O

from O
three O
months O

" O
I O
am O
sorry O
for O
these O
parents O
who O
perhaps O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
express O
their O
discomfort O
in O
the O
department O
, O
otherwise O
we O
would O
have O
solved O
, O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
because O
the O
physical O
space O
in O
pediatrics O
is O
a O
long O

standing O
problem O

always O
raised O
by O
me O
and O
more O
recently O

Giannelli B-PER

Surely O
something O
has O
gone O
wrong O

is O
why O
I O

" O
It O
was O
all O

says O
Dr. O
Di B-PER

- O
It O
began O
the O
epidemic O

and O
, O
although O
hospitalizations O
are O

short O
as O

there O
are O

At O
the O
time O
, O
the O
new O
pediatric O
building O
of O
Santa B-ORG
Chiara I-ORG
represented O
a O
great O
innovation O

to O
the O
fact O
that O

brought O

level O
as O

" O
The O
needs O
of O

, O
have O
changed O
completely O

- O
. O

We O
make O
a O
low O
number O
of O
admissions O
in O
absolute O
terms O
, O
because O
they O
are O
around O
1200 O

Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
said O
: O

" O
It O
was O
a O
very O
difficult O
meeting O
, O
with O
an O
external O
representation O
transformed O
into O
a O
caricature O
: O

It O
seemed O
that O
we O
had O
to O
choose O
between O
Prodi B-PER
and O
the O
Ulivo B-ORG
on O
one O
side O
and O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
on O
the O
other O
. O

Imagine O
my O
embarrassment O
, O
I O
who O
have O
always O
been O
Prodi O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
co O
- O
founder O
of O
Margherita B-ORG
. O

But O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
makes O
it O
known O
to O
have O
supported O
" O
with O
serenity O
" O
the O
Rutelli B-PER
line O
: O

" O
Ours O
is O
not O
an O
anti O
- O
ulivist O
choice O
, O
nor O
against O
Prodi B-PER
. O

We O
have O
only O
underlined O
that O
in O
this O
moment O
there O
are O
more O
reasons O
for O
the O
autonomous O
presence O
of O
Margherita B-ORG
than O
for O
the O
unique O
list O
" O
. O

The O
stop O
to O
the O
unitary O
proposal O
( O
supported O
by O
Prodi B-PER
and O
Fassino B-PER
) O
, O
however O
, O
puts O
a O
brake O
on O
the O
unitary O
party O
, O
postponed O
to O
better O
times O
: O

" O
On O
this O
we O
must O
understand O
each O
other O
- O
continues O
Dellai B-PER
- O
We O
have O
only O
said O
contrary O
to O
the O
unitary O
list O
in O
the O
proportional O
quota O
, O
which O
elects O
25 O
% O
of O
the O
deputies O
. O

But O
if O
the O
' O
objective O
was O
to O
continue O
towards O
the O
single O
party O
, O
I O
say O
that O
for O
the O
moment O
there O
are O
no O
organizational O
, O
programmatic O
and O
political O
conditions O
to O
do O
so O
. O

It O
's O
a O
path O
that O
in O
a O
few O
years O
will O
reach O
its O
objective O
. O

Romano B-PER
Prodi I-PER
did O
not O
take O
it O
well O
: O

" O
No O
one O
is O
questioning O
him O
- O
Dellai B-PER
concludes O
- O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
many O
have O
said O
they O
would O
like O
Romano B-PER
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
. O

He O
remains O
the O
leader O
. O

And O
Rutelli B-PER
's O
document O
points O
to O
the O
' O
Union B-ORG
and O
also O
to O
the O
Federation B-ORG
, O
while O
leaving O
autonomy O
to O
the O
parties O
. O

Statements O
in O
line O
with O
Mauro B-PER
Betta I-PER
, O
who O
denies O
that O
the O
approved O
document O
is O
a O
" O
niet O
" O
: O

" O
Rutelli B-PER
said O
" O
yes O
" O
to O
the O
Union B-ORG
and O
to O
Prodi B-PER
, O
to O
the O
Federation B-ORG
and O
to O
Margherita B-ORG
. O

The O
choice O
of O
the O
single O
list O
is O
only O
" O
technical O
" O
, O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
it O
concerns O
how O
to O
present O
a O
single O
list O
. O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
it O
concerns O
the O
way O
to O
present O
oneself O
in O
the O
proportional O
. O

But O
the O
unitary O
subject O
is O
not O
mature O
: O

" O
First O
we O
do O
the O
' O
Union B-ORG
, O
then O
we O
can O
talk O
about O
it O
- O
continues O
the O
provincial O
coordinator O
of O
Margaret B-ORG
- O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
vote O
today O
( O
yesterday O
for O
those O
who O
read O
, O
ed O
. O
) O
will O
be O
interpreted O
in O
the O
right O
way O
: O

It O
is O
not O
convenience O
, O
but O
the O
need O
to O
become O
truly O
interlocutors O
in O
society O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
Ds B-ORG
had O
made O
a O
forcing O
. O

Tomorrow O
will O
be O
the O
day O
of O
the O
five O
ballots O
: O

In O
Rovereto B-LOC
, O
Arco B-LOC
, O
Baselga B-LOC

Pinè I-LOC

. O

An O
important O
appointment O
especially O
for O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
which O
in O
some O
municipalities O
has O
shown O
signs O
of O
collapse O
: O

" O
I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
balance O
of O
the O
party O
is O
already O
very O
positive O
- O
explains O
Betta B-PER
- O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
those O
who O
speak O
of O
Margherita B-ORG
in O
decline O
. O

Some O
examples O
? O

In O
Borgo B-LOC
we O
have O
gone O
from O
15 O
to O
32 O
% O
, O
in O
Pergine B-LOC
from O
15 O
to O
23 O
% O
, O
while O
in O
Riva B-LOC
and O
Cles B-LOC
we O
have O
doubled O
. O

I O
am O
surprised O
to O
see O
on O
your O
newspaper O
the O
list O
of O
countries O
where O
the O
administrations O
have O
not O
been O
confirmed O
: O

In O
front O
of O
these O
cases O
I O
remember O
Pinzolo B-LOC
and O
Dro B-LOC
, O
but O
also O
Coredo B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
local O
government O
was O
center O
- O
right O
. O

Certainly O
an O
eventual O
defeat O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC
and O
Arco B-LOC
would O
have O
very O
heavy O
consequences O
: O

" O
But O
we O
can O
no O
longer O
speak O
of O
mayors O
of O
expression O
of O
Margaret B-ORG
, O
because O
it O
is O
the O
whole O
coalition O
to O
be O
involved O
- O
says O
the O
regional O
leader O
Giorgio B-PER
Lunelli I-PER
- O
The O
Ds B-ORG
have O
done O
a O
good O
job O
, O
like O
us O
: O

For O
this O
reason O
I O
am O
confident O
. O

Some O
defeats O
, O
such O
as O
Tuenno B-LOC
and O
Lona B-LOC
Lases I-LOC
, O
are O
alarm O
signals O
: O

" O
I O
could O
mention O

the O
greetings O
of O

was O
present O
the O
Councillor O
for O
Transport O
Silvano B-PER
Grisenti I-PER
. O

In O
his O
brief O
speech O
he O
wanted O
to O
ensure O
that O
Piazza B-LOC

has O
no O
intention O
of O
imposing O
new O
taxes O
on O
cars O
" O
not O
to O
pour O
more O
costs O
on O

. O

He O
then O
added O
: O

" O
Provocatively O
I O
say O
that O
the O
' O
car O
can O
not O
be O
seen O
as O
an O
invasive O
tool O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
understand O
the O
efforts O
that O
the O
Province B-LOC
does O
to O
support O
and O
improve O
public O
transport O
. O

There O
is O
a O
way O
to O
be O
attentive O
to O
others O
without O
resorting O
to O
blatant O
choices O
. O
And O
there O
is O
a O
way O
to O

the O

a O
precise O
interest O
of O
the O
Tremembè B-ORG

, O
which O
for O
years O
has O
been O
dealing O
with O
it O
together O
with O
Progetto B-ORG
Prijedor I-ORG
. O

Why O
? O

" O
Over O
the O
years O
I O
had O
always O
followed O
the O
war O
in O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
and O
I O
was O
deeply O
disturbed O
by O
so O
much O
violence O
. O

There O
, O
as O
in O
many O
other O
places O
in O
the O
world O
( O
and O
unfortunately O
as O
it O
is O
happening O
now O
between O
Israel B-LOC
and O
Palestine B-LOC
) O
, O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
only O
way O
to O
resolve O
disputes O
was O
conflict O
. O

Although O
I O
was O
attracted O
to O
those O
areas O
, O
there O
was O
always O
something O
that O
kept O
me O
from O
actually O
going O
there O
. O

It O
was O
as O
if O
all O
the O
hatred O
and O
ferocity O
, O
the O
inability O
to O
relate O
to O
others O
except O
with O
weapons O
and O
abuse O
, O
kept O
me O
away O
. O

Was O
it O
a O
difficult O
journey O
? O

" O
We O
left O
in O
four O
people O
in O
a O
car O
and O
without O
an O
escort O
, O
but O
one O
of O
us O
had O
been O
in O
those O
areas O
before O
, O
traveling O
by O
bicycle O
with O
a O
tour O
organized O
by O
Viaggiare B-ORG

) O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
association O
had O
prepared O
the O
ground O
for O
us O
by O
booking O
accommodation O
and O
local O
guides O
, O
a O
help O
that O
- O
when O
you O
travel O
in O
those O
countries O
and O
in O
that O
way O
- O
is O
invaluable O
. O

Everything O
went O
well O
anyway O
: O

we O
were O
hosted O
by O
families O
, O
coming O
into O
contact O
with O
the O
local O
realities O
, O
we O
lived O
with O
the O
families O
and O
listened O
to O
their O
stories O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
many O
countries O
already O
rebuilt O
but O
also O
many O
needs O
and O
necessities O
that O
have O
not O
yet O
found O
answers O
. O

And O
you O
can O
feel O
the O
effort O
to O
return O
to O
normality O
everywhere O
, O
even O
if O
the O
wounds O
are O
still O
there O
and O
it O
will O
take O
time O
for O
them O
to O
heal O
. O

It O
has O
undoubtedly O
been O
an O
enriching O
experience O
that O
has O
left O
us O
with O
precious O
memories O
. O

Among O
the O
material O
collected O
by O
Giovanna B-PER
, O
there O
are O
surprising O
illustrations O
of O
places O
, O
such O
as O
the O
Water O
Road O
Put O
vode O
, O
a O
path O
in O
central O
Serbia O
that O
winds O
through O
monasteries O
, O
castles O
and O
spas O
, O
along O
rivers O
and O
streams O
that O
weave O
and O
unravel O
on O
the O
territory O
. O

And O
it O
makes O
you O
wonder O
why O
so O
many O
of O
us O
feel O
more O
at O
home O
in O
some O
unlikely O
and O
invented O
place O
like O
Sharm B-LOC
( O
so O
it O
is O
now O
familiarly O
called O
Sharm B-LOC
el I-LOC
Sheikh I-LOC
by O
the O
many O
people O
who O
have O
spent O
a O
few O
days O
there O
) O
and O
have O
never O
thought O
to O
put O
his O
nose O
a O
few O
steps O
from O
home O
, O
in O
these O
beautiful O
places O
, O
rich O
in O
art O
, O
nature O
and O
history O
. O

History O
that O
so O
often O
- O
and O
even O
recently O
- O
has O
painfully O
concerned O
us O
closely O
. O

Luckily O
there O
is O
always O
someone O
out O
of O
the O
choir O
. O

Because O
the O
real O
discovery O
is O
not O
to O
look O
for O
new O
lands O
but O
to O
look O
with O
new O
eyes O

never O

Rizzoli B-PER
observes O
that O
by O
now O
the O
question O
of O
the O
incinerator O
has O
become O
a O
taboo O
, O
even O
in O
relations O
between O
the O
bishop O
and O
the O
president O
: O

" O
President O
Dellai B-PER
could O
not O
fail O
to O
mention O
the O
incinerator O
issue O
, O
which O
is O
also O
at O
the O
center O
of O
attention O
, O
although O
more O
discreetly O
addressed O
by O
Archbishop O
Bressan B-PER
. O

Almost O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
more O
delicate O
and O
politically O
burdensome O
subject O
, O
with O
so O
little O
willingness O
to O
engage O
in O
a O
real O
confrontation O
. O

Not O
even O
among O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
local O
Church B-ORG
, O
in O
fact O
, O
do O
they O
have O
the O
courage O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
; O

It O
would O
almost O
seem O
that O
it O
should O
remain O
a O
taboo O
, O
even O
if O
many O
religious O
feel O
the O
need O
for O
greater O
coherence O
and O
presence O
on O
social O
issues O
on O
which O
the O
Catholic O
base O
is O
actually O
much O
more O
sensitive O
and O
vigilant O
than O
one O
might O
think O
. O

In O
his O
speech O
, O
the O
President O
recalls O
some O
challenges O
; O

He O
writes O
that O
" O
governing O
means O
taking O
into O
account O
all O
positions O
, O
confronting O
everyone O
" O
. O
While O
he O
continues O
to O
refuse O
a O
frank O
confrontation O
with O
the O
opponents O
of O
his O
incinerator O
project O
. O

While O
he O
does O
not O
allow O
a O

The O

" O
In O
a O

explains O
Tarfusser B-PER

the O

" O
It O

Among O
the O
advantages O

the O
precise O

Satisfied O
Pinter B-PER
that O
, O
with O
nine O
amendments O
to O
the O
bill O
of O
the O

, O
has O
managed O

but O
that O
rejects O
the O
' O
accusation O
of O
" O
an O

" O
aimed O
at O
President O
Dellai B-PER
. O

The O
reaction O
of O
the O
oppositions O
was O
very O
harsh O
, O
in O
particular O
that O
of O
Giovanazzi B-PER
who O
accused O
the O

of O
weakness O
, O
" O
shot O

by O

President O

, O
on O
the O
other O

, O
is O
determined O
to O

firm O

and O
has O
already O
declared O
that O
he O
will O
present O
the O
original O

in O

, O
" O
because O
it O
responds O
to O
the O
need O
to O
clarify O
the O
legislative O
framework O
in O
which O
hunting O
takes O
place O
, O
in O
light O
of O
the O
recent O
Constitutional B-ORG
Court I-ORG
ruling O
, O
adapting O
the O
provincial O
legislation O
to O
the O
national O
one O
" O
. O

All O
three O
bills O
will O
arrive O
in O
the O
courtroom O
, O
along O
with O
the O
" O
radically O
modified O
" O
text O
of O
the O
junta B-ORG
, O
which O
will O
have O
to O
be O
restored O
. O

But O
I O
hope O
that O
there O
will O
be O
room O
for O
discussion O
, O
" O
says O
Pinter B-PER
, O
" O
with O
some O
signs O
of O
less O
conflict O
between O
those O
who O
want O
too O
extensive O
a O
use O
of O
hunting O
and O
those O
who O
are O
against O
hunting O
. O

There O
are O
three O
issues O
on O
which O
Pinter B-PER
hopes O
there O
will O
be O
a O
rethink O
: O

The O
respect O
of O
Sunday O
as O
a O
day O
of O
hunting O
silence O
, O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
old O
system O
of O
hunting O
ungulates O
from O
September O
1 O
, O
excluding O
the O
summer O
period O
, O
and O
the O
elimination O
of O
15 O
days O
in O
August O
for O
hunting O
chamois O
. O

" O
Sunday O
as O
a O
day O
of O
hunting O
silence O
has O
always O
been O
an O
old O
passion O
of O
mine O
, O
on O
holidays O
the O
mountains O
are O
more O
crowded O
and O
there O
are O
more O
people O
in O
the O
woods O
- O
explains O
Pinter B-PER
- O
. O

Second O
: O

The O
rule O
says O
that O
the O
hunting O
days O
are O
three O
out O
of O
five O
, O
but O
at O
the O
hunter O
's O
choice O
, O
which O
ultimately O
brings O
them O
to O
five O
; O

I O
said O
no O
, O
that O
the O
days O
are O
actually O
three O
. O

Although O
it O
has O
been O
pointed O
out O
to O
me O
that O
in O
Alto B-LOC
Adige I-LOC
people O
hunt O
seven O
days O
out O
of O
seven O
, O
I O
do O
not O
see O
why O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
we O
can O
not O
do O
better O
. O

I O
start O
from O
the O
principle O
that O
, O
without O
prejudice O
to O
hunting O
, O
in O
fewer O
days O
we O
do O
it O
the O
better O
we O
all O
are O
, O
because O
there O
is O
a O
contiguity O
of O
presence O
that O
is O
not O
only O
a O
danger O
, O
but O
also O
a O
problem O
of O
peace O
for O
the O
fauna O
and O
for O
nature O
. O

The O
third O
question O
posed O
by O
Pinter B-PER
, O
and O
removed O
from O
the O
amended O
text O
, O
is O
that O
concerning O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
old O
hunting O
calendar O
, O
with O
the O
collection O
of O
ungulates O
also O
allowed O
in O
the O
period O
from O
May O
1 O
to O
June O
30 O
. O

" O
It O
is O
clear O
that O
this O
was O
the O
main O
content O
of O
the O
law O
- O
continues O
Pinter B-PER
- O
but O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
lengthen O
the O
time O
to O
allow O
a O
withdrawal O
well O
done O
. O

Among O
other O
things O
, O
even O
some O
representatives O
of O
hunters O
have O
expressed O
concern O
about O
this O
period O
which O
is O
the O
one O
in O
which O
there O
are O
in O
circulation O
the O
smallest O
puppies O
. O

Pinter B-PER
's O
amendment O
cancelled O
this O
possibility O
, O
reintroduced O
by O
national O
legislation O
and O
contested O
by O
animal O
rights O
activists O
. O

With O
Divina B-PER
and O
Chiocchetti B-PER
absent O
, O
Pinter B-PER
made O
his O
vote O
count O
, O
which O
weighed O
twice O
, O
and O
with O
the O
vote O
of O
Bombarda B-PER
and O
Carli B-PER
on O
Sunday O
, O
he O
overturned O
the O
text O
presented O
by O
the O
council B-ORG
. O

At O
this O
point O
the O
law O
was O
rejected O
, O
but O
will O
go O
to O
the O
classroom O
with O
the O
text O
amended O
forcing O
the O
majority O
to O
start O
again O
with O
amendments O
. O

I O
have O
no O
illusions O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
expect O
hunting O
to O
disappear O
overnight O
, O
" O
Pinter B-PER
concludes O
, O
" O
but O
I O
think O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
some O
forms O
of O
inattention O
towards O
tourism O
and O
those O
who O
frequent O
the O
woods O
will O
be O
attenuated O
. O

exhausted O

For O
this O
reason O
yesterday O
the O
council B-ORG
decided O
that O

will O
be O
increased O
. O

From O

it O

This O

25 O

" O

They O
are O

half O

as O
someone O
said O

" O
commented O
the O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
in O
the O
month O

August O
the O

are O
much O
lower O
than O
the O

. O

The O
other O
complaint O
that O
emerged O
is O
related O
to O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
service O
, O
93 O
euros O
per O

. O

Definitely O
high O
if O

" O
But O
let O

not O

- O
Pegoretti B-PER
points O
out O
- O
that O
the O
summer O
service O
is O
made O
available O
by O
the O
Municipality B-LOC

meet O
the O
needs O
of O
families O
. O

We O
do O
not O
receive O
any O
contribution O
from O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

This O
is O
why O
we O
have O
asked O
for O
a O
rate O
coverage O
equal O
to O
half O
of O
the O

. O

The O
maximum O

is O
paid O
by O
a O
small O
minority O
, O
just O
over O
10 O
% O
. O

Another O
10 O

or O
so O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
Isee O
rates O
, O

Also O
for O
the O
symbolic O

that O
this O

The O

recalls O
how O
the O
entire O
eastern O

considered O
an O
area O
at O
risk O
from O
the O
hydrogeological O
point O

It O
is O
the O
starting O
point O
of O
his O
reasoning O

" O
We O
are O
on O
paleo O

landslides O
that O
, O
if O
left O
alone O
, O
can O
hold O
up O
quietly O
, O
but O
if O
we O
start O
building O
on O
them O
, O
they O
risk O
coming O
down O

It O
's O
like O
that O
on O
the O
whole O
Calisio B-LOC

instead O
of O

we O

think O
about O

According O
to O
Calì B-PER
, O
the O
cancellation O
of O
the O

of O

' O

would O
be O
an O
important O
political O

after O

delicate O

If O
not O
, O
the O
responsibility O
will O
be O
mainly O
of O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
. O

" O
I O
wonder O
- O
attacks O
the O
vice O
president O
of O
the O
district B-LOC
- O
where O
is O
the O
consistency O
of O
this O
party O
that O
shares O
the O
principle O
of O
stop O
all O
' O
building O
in O
the O

but O
then O
Povo B-LOC
gives O
a O
negative O
opinion O
on O
the O
removal O
of O
a O
' O
craft O
area O
while O
Argentario B-LOC
decides O
to O
build O
a O
new O
one O
. O

It O
also O
considers O
incongruous O
the O
choice O
to O
place O
side O
by O
side O
to O
the O
private O
settlement O
public O

that O
, O
considering O
the O

will O
cost O

Also O
because O
a O
possible O
alternative O
would O

" O
There O

building O
near O
the O
Poli O

twenty O

The O
fact O
is O
that O

ROME B-LOC
- O
With O
the O
devolution O
government O
has O
completed O
the O
twelve O
tables O
of O
our O
program O
: O
missing O
only O
the O
tax O
reform O

but O
on O
this O
point O
we O
are O
in O
trouble O
for O
the O
hole O
that O
we O
found O
, O
we O
will O
see O
in O
the O
budget O
to O
give O
some O
signal O

With O
these O
words O
, O
they O
say O
, O
Berlusconi B-PER
would O
have O
concluded O
the O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
, O
thus O
expressing O
his O
satisfaction O
for O
having O
successfully O
overcome O
the O
obstacle O
of O
federal O
reform O
. O

A O
result O
achieved O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
Council B-ORG
meeting O
not O
exactly O
quiet O
. O

Indeed O
, O
according O
to O
what O
has O
been O
learned O
, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
several O
moments O
of O
tension O
for O
the O
verbal O
clashes O
between O
ministers O

But O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
the O
devolution O
to O
heat O
up O
the O
souls O
. O

The O
first O
lively O
debate O
there O
would O
have O
been O
in O
fact O
for O
the O
ratification O
of O
the O
Treaty O
of O
Nice B-LOC
. O

The O
Minister O
for O

, O
Umberto B-PER
Bossi I-PER
, O
would O
have O
expressed O
himself O
clearly O
contrary O
, O
defining O
this O
treaty O
as O
" O
undemocratic O
" O
. O

Other O
ministers O
would O
have O
pointed O
out O
to O
the O
Carroccio B-ORG
leader O
that O
the O
passage O
to O
the O
Chambers O
of O
a O
text O
so O
important O
for O
the O
European B-LOC
Union I-LOC
is O
" O
a O
due O
act O
" O
. O

On O
positions O
close O
to O
those O
of O
Bossi B-PER
, O
even O
if O
with O
some O
differences O
, O
would O
have O
lined O
up O
also O
Giulio B-PER
Tremonti I-PER

Antonio B-PER
Martino I-PER
. O

At O
that O
point O
the O
Minister O
for O
Community O
Policies O
, O
Rocco B-PER
Buttiglione I-PER
, O
would O
have O
raised O
his O
voice O
arguing O
strongly O
that O
the O
Europeanist O
commitment O
is O
part O
of O
the O
government O
's O
program O
at O
least O
as O
much O
as O
devolution O
. O

Berlusconi B-PER
would O
not O
have O
intervened O
in O
the O
discussion O
, O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
an O
intervention O
of O
the O
Minister O
of O
Foreign O
Affairs O
Renato B-PER
Ruggiero I-PER
to O
convince O
Bossi B-PER
to O
yield O
. O

The O
second O
proposal O
that O
registered O
a O
lively O
debate O
was O
the O
project O
of O
constitutional O
reform O
advanced O
by O
the O
Minister O
for O
Equal O
Opportunities O
Stefania B-PER
Prestigiacomo I-PER
, O
aimed O
at O
modifying O
art O

51 O
to O
encourage O
the O
presence O
of O
women O
in O
the O
elected O
assemblies O
. O

Also O
in O
this O
case O
it O
would O
have O
been O
Bossi B-PER
to O
protest O
vigorously O
. O

Bossi B-PER
would O
have O
pointed O
out O
that O
, O
since O
he O
is O
the O
Minister O
for O
Reforms O
, O
any O
proposal O
to O
modify O
the O
Constitution O
must O
be O
submitted O
to O
his O
examination O
. O

" O
It O
is O
I O
who O
propose O
the O
reforms O
in O
this O
government O
- O
he O
would O
have O
asked O
irritated O
- O
is O
n't O
it O
true O
? O

" O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
the O

would O
have O
obtained O
more O
consensus O
, O
thus O
making O
it O
necessary O
to O
examine O
the O
merits O
of O
the O
proposal O
. O

Many O
would O
have O
objected O
that O
talking O
about O
" O
equal O
access O
" O
would O
have O
reopened O
the O
age O
- O
old O
question O
of O
" O
quotas O
" O
. O

If O
we O
start O
with O
women O
, O
it O
was O
argued O
, O
we O
might O
then O
come O
to O
establish O
a O

be O
reserved O
for O
linguistic O

Hence O
the O
solution O
of O
introducing O
the O
less O

expression O
of O
" O
equal O
opportunities O
" O
in O
the O
rewriting O
of O

the O
point O
with O

Having O
set O
aside O
the O

of O

an O
amendment O

United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
it O
was O
quite O
easy O
to O
win O
the O
war O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
the O
aftermath O
. O

To O
maintain O
a O
military O
force O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
for O
six O
months O
, O
a O
year O
or O
two O
- O
as O
one O
hears O
people O
say O
- O
is O
a O
difficult O
undertaking O
. O

The O
Americans O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
everything O
, O
are O
not O
seen O
as O
a O
force O
of O
liberation O
but O
of O
conquest O
. O

To O
create O
an O
externally O
imposed O
democracy O
with O
weapons O
is O
difficult O
and O
the O
conflict O
will O
trigger O
various O
forms O
of O
resistance O
, O
which O
will O
make O
it O
difficult O
to O
maintain O
order O
. O

To O
this O
is O
added O
the O
economic O
effect O
. O

If O
the O
American O
economy O
shows O
the O
current O
difficulties O
to O
restart O
, O
maintaining O
an O
armed O
force O
in O
a O
part O
of O
the O
world O
with O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
instability O
, O
will O
be O
an O
argument O
that O
the O
American O
electorate O
will O
be O
ready O
to O
accept O
. O

At O
that O
point O
the O
current O
leadership O
, O
Rumsfeld B-PER
Wolfowitz B-PER
Condoleeza B-PER
Rice I-PER
Cheney B-PER
, O
will O
be O
forced O
to O
change O
their O
line O
with O
respect O
to O
this O
" O
democratic O
imperialism O
" O
that O
the O
war O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
seems O
to O
have O
inaugurated O
. O

It O
will O
not O
be O
the O
war O
that O
will O
change O
their O
minds O
, O
but O
the O
post O
- O
war O
period O
" O
. O

So O
far O
, O
however O
, O
there O
are O
no O
signals O
in O
this O
direction O
. O

We O
have O
a O
victorious O
president O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
Americans O
; O

The O
line O
of O
the O
multilateralists O
( O
Colin B-PER
Powell I-PER
) O
within O
the O
Bush B-PER
administration O
is O
a O
loser O
compared O
to O
the O
unilateralism O
of O
Paul B-PER
Wolfowitz I-PER
; O

National O
Security O
Advisor O
Condoleeza B-PER
Rice I-PER
speaks O
of O
the O
exclusion O
of O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
in O
the O
peace O
keeping O
and O
reconstruction O
phase O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

In O
short O
, O
the O
line O
according O
to O
which O
" O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
come O
first O
" O
, O
appears O
to O
be O
winning O
on O
all O
fronts O
. O
appears O
to O
be O
winning O
on O
every O
front O
. O

Now O
there O
is O
talk O
of O
continuing O
the O
triumphant O
advance O
in O
Syria B-LOC
, O
Iran B-LOC
and O
Korea B-LOC
. O

" O
We O
are O
careful O
. O

The O
Iraq B-LOC
case O
was O
easy O
to O
test O
the O
new O
policy O
. O

Saddam B-PER
was O
a O
dictator O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
convince O
the O
American O
public O
that O
he O
was O
a O
danger O
that O
had O
to O
be O
eliminated O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
same O
American O
leaders O
thought O
they O
had O
more O
allies O
on O
their O
side O
. O

If O
now O
the O
" O
new O
policy O
" O
is O
extended O
to O
Syria B-LOC
, O
not O
even O
Blair B-PER
will O
go O
along O
. O

It O
will O
not O
be O
so O
easy O
to O
extend O
the O
war O
to O
other O
countries O
. O

And O
then O
what O
? O

If O
America B-LOC
suffers O
another O
act O
of O
terrorism O
, O
how O
will O
public O
opinion O
react O
? O

Bush B-PER
said O
: O

Away O
with O
Saddam B-PER
, O
away O
with O
terrorism O
. O

Maybe O
at O
that O
point O
the O
reflection O
that O
did O
n't O
take O
place O
after O
September O
11 O
can O
be O
triggered O
. O

American O
public O
opinion O
at O
that O
point O
will O
ask O
itself O
if O
weapons O
are O
really O
the O
most O
suitable O
means O
for O
an O
international O
peace O
. O

In O
America B-LOC
there O
is O
a O
strong O
minority O
, O
today O
silent O
, O
that O
can O
react O
to O
the O
elections O
in O
a O
different O
way O
from O
what O
the O
Bush B-PER
administration O
expects O
. O

Let O
's O
remember O
that O
the O
election O
of O
the O
president O
took O
place O
in O
a O
country O
split O
in O
half O
, O
which O
has O
strong O
internal O
opposition O
to O
the O
war O
( O
Noam B-PER
Chomsky I-PER
) O
, O
which O
has O
seen O
the O
Americans O
until O
the O
last O
moment O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
second O
UN O
resolution O
. O

Iraq B-LOC
, O
however O
, O
has O
demonstrated O
that O
, O
all O
things O
considered O
, O
waging O
war O
for O
the O
most O
powerful O
army O
in O
the O
world O
is O
easy O
and O
quick O
. O

In O
less O
than O
a O
month O
, O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
occupy O
Saddam B-PER
's O
palaces O
. O

Among O
the O
300,000 O
men O
employed O
, O
the O
casualties O
were O
just O
a O
handful O
, O
and O
mostly O
due O
to O
" O
friendly O
fire O
" O
. O

Could O
n't O
this O
change O
the O
minds O
of O
many O
and O
make O
them O
believe O
that O
war O
could O
become O
the O
ordinary O
means O
of O
American O
foreign O
policy O
? O

" O
There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
idea O
that O
war O
is O
a O
message O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
Syria B-LOC
and O
Iraq B-LOC
has O
always O
been O
held O
by O
leading O
figures O
such O
as O
Rumsfeld B-PER
and O
Wolfowitz O
. O

As O
if O
to O
say O
: O

Be O
careful O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
behave O
we O
will O
come O
to O
you O
. O

The O
reality O
, O
however O
, O
is O
not O
so O
simple O
. O

In O
waging O
war O
, O
the O
Americans O
have O
proved O
themselves O
good O
. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
however O
, O
if O
they O
will O
be O
as O
good O
in O
the O
management O
of O
peace O
keeping O
and O
nation O
building O
. O

We O
must O
remember O
that O
Iraq B-LOC
is O
a O
country O
to O
be O
rebuilt O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
foresee O
that O
, O
after O
the O
first O
enthusiasm O
, O
after O
a O
few O
months O
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
will O
realize O
that O
it O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
control O
the O
country O
, O
to O
rebuild O
it O
, O
to O
establish O
a O
democratic O
government O
. O

And O
this O
will O
force O
us O
to O
rethink O
the O
role O
of O
international O
organizations O
, O
of O
Europe B-LOC
, O
of O
multilateral O
alliances O
, O
of O
the O
casual O
use O
of O
weapons O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
however O
, O
relations O
between O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
Europe B-LOC
are O
on O
ice O
; O

The O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
no O
longer O
has O
any O
role O
; O

NATO B-ORG
is O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
line O
; O

Every O
hypothesis O
of O
multilateral O
alliances O
has O
disappeared O
. O

Rebuilding O
this O
network O
of O
relations O
and O
institutions O
will O
not O
be O
child O
's O
play O
. O

For O
a O
united B-LOC
Europe I-LOC
it O
is O
an O
unprecedented O
blow O
. O

" O
If O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
will O
continue O
to O
think O
to O
manage O
the O
post O
- O
war O
period O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
by O
itself O
, O
without O
the O
UN B-ORG
and O
without O
the O
EU O
, O
we O
will O
see O
a O
recompacting O
of O
Europe B-LOC
. O

The O
eight O
pro O
- O
U.S. B-LOC
European O
countries O
will O
find O
themselves O
displaced O
to O
support O
an O
uncritical O
position O
alongside O
the O
States B-LOC
. O

Blair B-PER
himself O
would O
be O
in O
serious O
difficulty O
. O

If O
the O
management O
of O
the O
post O
- O
war O
period O
- O
as O
analysts O
foresee O
- O
proves O
to O
be O
bitter O
and O
risky O
, O
at O
that O
point O
it O
would O
be O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
itself O
that O
would O
present O
itself O
before O
the O
UN B-ORG
and O
ask O
the O
international O
community O
to O
come O
forward O
. O

If O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
we O
were O
to O
witness O
a O
victorious O
post O
- O
war O
management O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
US B-LOC
, O
then O
indeed O
Europe B-LOC
would O
find O
itself O
greatly O
weakened O
, O
and O
the O
international O
institutions O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
line O
. O

But O
I O
think O
that O
's O
the O
least O
likely O
scenario O
. O

The O
fact O
remains O
that O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
has O
demonstrated O
in O
the O
field O
to O
be O
a O
military O
force O
of O
incredible O
power O
, O
able O
to O
wage O
war O
alone O
, O
when O
it O
wants O
, O
against O
whom O
it O
wants O
, O
without O
anyone O
can O
oppose O
, O
and O
with O
human O
costs O
all O
in O
all O
contained O
thanks O
to O
technology O
. O

This O
will O
not O
remain O
without O
effects O
on O
a O
global O
scale O
, O
conditioning O
the O
relationships O
also O
with O
Europe B-LOC
and O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
's O
democracies O
. O

" O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
Americans O
themselves O
are O
surprised O
by O
the O
enormous O
and O
frightening O
military O
power O
they O
have O
. O

Such O
a O
strong O
superpower O
is O
very O
dangerous O
. O

There O
is O
a O
counterbalance O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
a O
democracy O
and O
has O
a O
public O
opinion O
to O
answer O
to O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
reassuring O
. O

Not O
only O
because O
of O
the O
use O
that O
can O
be O
made O
of O
military O
potential O
. O

But O
also O
because O
of O
the O
reactions O
it O
may O
trigger O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Those O
who O
know O
they O
are O
in O
the O
crosshairs O
will O
then O
say O
: O

I O
have O
nothing O
to O
lose O
and O
will O
trigger O
unthinkable O
reactions O
. O

As O
kamikaze O
and O
fedayeen O
do O
. O

One O
has O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
desperation O
of O
those O
who O
know O
they O
are O
losers O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
trust O
the O
American O
domestic O
public O
opinion O
. O

The O
Rumsfeld B-PER
line O
is O
not O
necessarily O
the O
winning O
one O
, O
and O
at O
the O
next O
presidential O
elections O
we O
could O
have O
some O
surprises O
and O
a O
decisive O
change O
of O
course O

it O
makes O
another O

We O
have O
an O

that O

because O
we O
are O

it O
, O
without O

We O
are O
full O
of O

for O

that O
the O

to O
resolve O

we O
know O
that O
he O
is O
the O
' O
arbiter O
of O
the O
times O
and O
ways O
of O
resolving O
the O

, O

if O
the O
' O

count O
, O
in O

, O
has O
been O
given O
a O

is O
that O

not O

. O

The O
leader O
of O

has O
then O
told O

Alema I-PER
Berlusconi B-PER
says O
to O
be O

the O

Then O
Berlusconi B-PER
threw O
a O
dig O
at O

: O

" O
It O
is O
not O
enough O
to O

It O
is O
not O
enough O
to O

It O
is O
not O
enough O
to O

him O
, O

more O
trivial O
to O

a O

Berlusconi B-PER
explains O
, O
however O
, O
that O
he O
has O
found O
" O
a O
country O
waiting O
to O
be O
quietly O
and O
calmly O
freed O
from O
the O
fetters O
of O
an O
intrusive O
, O
omnivorous O
power O
, O
which O
identifies O
itself O
with O
the O

that O
society O
knows O
how O
to O
propose O
only O
ties O
. O

The O
leader O
of O

also O
says O
that O
when O
the O

sailed O
, O
there O
were O
those O
who O
warned O
him O
saying O
: O

also O
the O
' O

of O

. O

The O
majority O
of O
the O
country O
- O
Berlusconi B-PER
explains O
- O
needed O
not O
only O
a O
program O
and O
an O
alternative O
ruling O
class O
, O
he O
needed O
above O
all O
a O
technique O
of O

, O
an O
incentive O
to O
feel O
adult O
and O
in O
full O
possession O
of O
themselves O
and O
there O
I O
realized O
that O
a O
certain O

a O

Prodi B-PER
had O
launched O
the O
message O
: O

" O
It O
is O
a O
very O
important O
beginning O
because O
it O
is O
a O
clear O
demonstration O
of O
the O
state O
of O
discomfort O
with O
the O
government O
's O
policy O
. O

Immediately O
after O
, O
the O
" O
professor O
" O
goes O
up O
to O
the O
Quirinal O
and O
later O
, O
to O
the O
journalists O
, O
he O
refers O
the O
sense O
of O
his O
speech O
to O
Ciampi B-PER
: O

" O
The O
game O
of O
democracy O
- O
he O
says O
referring O
to O
the O
par O
condicio O
- O
is O
too O
important O
to O
allow O
anyone O
to O
cheat O
. O

You O
can O
not O
change O
the O
rules O
when O
the O
game O
is O
about O
to O
end O
. O

The O
rules O
of O
the O
par O
condicio O
are O
the O
only O
defense O
, O
even O
if O
partial O
, O
against O
the O
excessive O
power O
of O
the O
media O
and O
for O
this O
reason O
they O
must O
be O
preserved O
. O

The O
manipulation O
at O
unified O
networks O
of O
recent O
days O
fully O
justifies O
our O
alarm O
. O

But O
to O
the O
Head O
of O

, O
Prodi B-PER
stresses O
that O
the O
government O

maneuver O
should O
be O
redone O
in O
toto O
because O
unfounded O
. O

But O
Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
, O
from O

does O
not O

his O
irritation O

The O

Just O
on O
the O

and O
the O
revision O
of O
the O

, O
he O
is O
not O
there O
. O

And O
in O
this O
he O
finds O
the O
support O
of O
the O
whole O
CDL B-ORG

His O
lunge O
from O

Not O
a O
day O
before O
it O

have O

For O
the O

Speroni B-PER
accused O
Prodi B-PER
of O
asking O
for O
new O
resources O

: O

" O
Padanian O

To O

with O
a O
promise O

for O
the O
whole O

. O

From O
the O
previous O
council B-ORG
, O
Dellai B-PER
also O
inherited O
this O
tragedy O
and O
its O
impossible O
legal O
solution O
. O

He O
shows O
that O
he O
wants O
to O
take O
charge O

it O

He O
refers O
the O

a O
subsequent O

" O

able O

He O
flies O

at O
7 O

sends O
his O
thoughts O
to O

They O
are O
very O
harsh O
words O
: O

" O
It O

a O
punch O
in O

no O

it O

He O
compares O
this O
American O
sentence O
to O
a O
" O
second O
tragedy O
" O
. O

So O
- O
adds O
the O
President O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
- O
I O
feel O
obliged O
, O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
whole O

to O
tell O
the O
relatives O
of O
the O
twenty O
victims O
of O
the O
tragedy O
of O
a O
year O

that O
our O
thoughts O
are O
with O
them O
: O

The O
Province B-LOC
will O
not O
abandon O
them O
and O
will O
do O
everything O
in O
its O
power O
to O
find O
new O
ways O
to O
reach O
a O
justice O
that O
can O
be O
defined O
as O
such O
and O
that O
takes O
into O
account O
the O
responsibility O
of O
everyone O
, O
including O
those O
who O
knew O
and O
kept O
silent O
, O
the O
guilt O
of O
those O
who O
are O
at O
fault O
. O

We O
- O
continues O
Dellai B-PER
- O
will O
not O
bow O
before O
this O
sentence O
. O

This O
morning O
there O
will O
be O
a O
meeting O
with O
the O
mayor O
of O
Cavalese B-LOC
, O
then O
the O
province B-LOC
will O
decide O
what O
possible O
steps O
to O
take O
. O

And O
Dellai B-PER
is O
not O
able O
to O
hold O
back O
a O
polemic O
against O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
Massimo B-PER
D'Alema I-PER
, O
last O
night O
in O
Washington B-LOC
: O

" O
I O
read O
his O
first O
statement O
in O
the O
agency O
- O
he O
says O
, O
again O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
from O
his O
office O
- O
and O
, O
with O
all O
due O
respect O
, O
understanding O
that O
this O
is O
a O
very O
sensitive O
issue O
, O
I O
dare O
to O
say O
that O
in O
the O
face O
of O
such O
a O
judgment O
we O
can O
not O
keep O
a O
" O
strict O
confidentiality O
" O
. O

We O
must O
raise O
our O
irrepressible O
need O
for O
justice O
. O

But O
let O
's O
go O
back O
to O
the O
official O
communiqué O
. O

Dellai B-PER
writes O
: O
" O
We O
have O
always O
asked O
for O
a O
serene O
and O
objective O
judgment O
and O
, O
despite O
the O
perplexity O
of O
many O
, O
we O
have O
also O
tried O
to O
understand O
the O
reasons O
behind O
the O
decision O
to O
transfer O
the O
trial O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

The O
news O
coming O
from O
America B-LOC
, O
however O
, O
leave O
us O
literally O
stunned O
and O
speechless O
. O

The O
acquittal O
is O
a O
punch O
in O
the O
stomach O
because O
this O
, O
contrary O
to O
many O
other O
unsolved O
cases O
, O
has O
always O
seemed O
a O
linear O
process O
: O

The O
' O
evidence O
of O
the O
facts O
is O
in O
the O
chronicle O
of O
the O
days O
immediately O
following O
that O
tragic O
February O
3 O
, O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
when O
an O
American O
plane O
, O
which O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
without O
a O
pilot O

in O

crashed O
into O
the O
cable O

killed O
the O
twenty O
people O
who O
were O
in O
the O
cabin O

These O
- O
clarifies O
Dellai B-PER
- O
are O
facts O
not O
conjectures O
. O

" O
Today O
, O
it O
seems O
out O
of O

to O
say O
that O
perhaps O
those O
who O
wanted O

by O

matured O
a O

exactly O
that O

while O
the O
role O
of O

Superior B-ORG

becomes O
decidedly O
marginal O
. O

A O
no O
from O

instead O
arrived O
to O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
an O

but O

The O
steps O
that O
led O
to O
the O
new O
solution O
for O
the O
appointment O
of O
the O

were O
not O
simple O
and O
some O
element O
of O
confusion O
emerged O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Council O
of O

that O
approved O
the O

ask O

" O
The O
criterion O
for O
the O

not O

said O

Prime O
Minister O
Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
, O
leaving O
the O
Chamber O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Council O

In O
the O
press O
conference O
called O
shortly O
afterwards O
, O
the O
Minister O
of O
Economy O
Giulio B-PER
Tremonti I-PER
gave O
different O
indications O
: O

the O
proposal O
of O
the O
governor O
is O
advanced O
by O
the O

heard O
the O
Superior B-ORG

to O
the O
Quirinale O
that O
signs O
the O

Same O
procedure O
for O
the O
revocation O
of O
the O
governor O
. O

The O
Council O

was O
preceded O
, O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
by O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
Quirinal O

Tremonti B-PER
, O
accompanied O
by O
the O
undersecretary O
of O
the O
Presidency B-ORG

the O
Council O
Gianni B-PER
Letta I-PER
. O

Tremonti B-PER
illustrated O
his O
proposal O
to O
Carlo I-PER
Azeglio I-PER
Ciampi I-PER
: O

Appointment O
of O
the O
governor O
proposed O
by O
the O
government O
, O
with O
the O
binding O
opinion O
of O
a O
qualified O
parliamentary O
majority O
. O

A O
solution O
that O
Ciampi B-PER
did O
not O
like O
because O
it O
would O
bind O
the O
future O
governor O
of O
Bankitalia B-ORG
too O
much O
to O
political O
choices O
. O

Greater O
autonomy O
seems O
to O
guarantee O
the O
solution O
then O
adopted O
, O
because O
it O
would O
reinforce O
the O
role O
of O
the O
Quirinal O
that O
instead O
would O
have O
less O
agility O
of O
intervention O
in O
front O
of O
a O
pronouncement O
of O
the O
Parliament B-ORG
. O

The O
opinion O
of O
the O
Chambers B-ORG
comes O
out O
of O
the O
government O
's O
proposal O
and O
the O
solution O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
displease O
the O
opposition O
, O
even O
if O
the O
hostility O
towards O
many O
other O
aspects O
of O
the O
reform O
is O
clear O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
, O
all O
the O
novelties O
of O
the O
government O

amendments O
are O
confirmed O
. O

The O
governor O
's O
term O
of O
office O
is O
six O
years O
, O
renewable O
: O

Even O
the O
directorate O
, O
which O
assumes O
broader O
powers O
in O
the O
name O
of O
collegiality O
required O
by O
the O
ECB B-ORG

is O
a O

six O

This O
means O
that O

it O

that O

no O
, O
a O
torment O
that O

not O
spare O
even O

Juve B-ORG
. O

Ancelotti B-PER
, O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
makes O
catenaccio O
. O

Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
could O
play O
alongside O
Trezeguet B-PER
, O
or O
start O
his O

on O

to O
leave O
room O
for O
Inzaghi B-PER
, O
without O
a O
goal O
in O
the O
league O
for O
9 O
months O
. O

" O
My O
evaluations O
in O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
formation O
- O
explains O
Ancelotti B-PER
- O
are O
of O
technical O
and O
tactical O
order O
, O
not O
psychological O
. O

The O
individual O
's O
condition O
counts O
, O
the O
way O
he O
worked O
during O
the O
week O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
believe O
in O
relays O
. O

It O
's O
true O
, O
Inzaghi B-PER
has O
n't O
scored O
goals O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
but O
he O
scored O
5 O
in O
the O
Champions O
Cup O
and O
on O
Sunday O
he O
came O
close O
at O
least O
three O
times O
. O

And O
Kovacevic B-PER
? O

No O
one O
talks O
about O
him O
, O
but O
he O
is O
very O
well O
and O
is O
on O
a O
par O
with O
the O
others O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
Ancelotti B-PER
explains O
that O
much O
will O
also O
depend O
on O
" O
the O
type O
of O
match O
we O
want O
to O
play O
" O
. O

We O
can O
guess O
that O
the O
technician O
would O
like O
to O
present O
an O
aggressive O
Juve B-ORG
, O
that O
will O
nip O
in O
the O
bud O
the O
ambitions O
of O
Inter B-ORG
, O
foaming O
with O
anger O
after O
the O
1 O
- O
6 O
defeat O
in O
Parma B-LOC
. O

" O
L O
' O
Inter B-ORG
- O
he O
explains O
- O
is O
in O
the O
same O
situation O
as O
ours O
after O
Athens B-LOC
, O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
match O
against O
Lazio B-ORG
" O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Ancelotti B-PER
noted O
, O
Parma B-LOC
was O
missing O
9 O
players O
who O
will O
be O
on O
the O
field O
today O
, O
so O
another O
Inter B-ORG

To O
make O
the O
match O
special O
for O
the O
Bianconeri O
season O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
is O
Roma B-ORG
, O
so O
detached O
in O
the O
standings O
: O

" O
It O
will O
be O
a O
challenge O
- O
confirms O
Ancelotti B-PER
- O
that O
will O
tell O
if O
Juve B-ORG
will O
be O
protagonist O
like O
last O
year O
, O
together O
with O
the O
following O
ones O
with O
Parma B-ORG
and O
Roma B-ORG
. O

We O
arrive O
there O
in O
good O
condition O
, O
considering O
the O
problems O
we O
had O
only O
a O
month O
ago O
. O

Ancelotti B-PER
also O
knows O
well O
that O
his O
luck O
" O
is O
linked O
to O
that O
of O
the O
team O
" O
. O

But O
he O
consoles O
himself O
by O
looking O
at O
the O
other O
technicians O
: O

" O
They O
all O
have O
problems O
, O
even O
Capello B-PER

a O
party O

both O
on O

A O
party O
in O
the O

Not O
for O
Milan B-ORG

If O
the O
first O
half O
was O
a O
good O
run O
- O
in O
, O
enough O
to O
win O
the O
match O
, O
the O
second O
half O
was O
suffering O
, O
too O
much O
to O
clean O
up O
the O
image O
of O
" O
great O
Milan O
" O
with O
which O
the O
Netherlands O
had O
welcomed O
him O
. O

This O
was O

Milan B-ORG
, O
first O
leg O
match O
of O
the O
Uefa O
Cup O
round O
of O
16 O

Victory O
as O
much O
announced O
as O
suffered O
, O
the O
Rossoneri O
, O
and O
obtained O
with O
a O
good O
dose O
of O
fatigue O
if O
you O
think O
that O
Roda B-ORG
is O
the O
fourth O
last O
in O
the O
Dutch O
league O
and O
that O
for O
many O
players O
last O
night O
's O
challenge O
was O
the O
game O
of O
life O
. O

The O
Rossoneri O
have O
been O
called O
since O
1 O
' O
to O
respond O
blow O
by O
blow O
to O
the O
very O
physical O
soccer O
of O
opponents O
. O

The O
result O
was O
a O
game O
that O
the O
Milan O
team O
controlled O
well O
for O
the O
first O
45 O
' O
, O
and O
very O
badly O
in O
the O
second O
half O
. O

For O
Roda B-ORG
, O
Ancelotti B-PER
had O
preferred O
Andrea B-PER
Pirlo I-PER
to O
Rui I-PER
Costa I-PER
and O
had O
set O
up O
the O
team O
according O
to O
a O
4 O
- O
4 O
- O
1 O
- O
1 O
with O
Shevchenko B-PER
as O
the O
only O
point O
and O
Josè B-PER
Mari I-PER
as O
the O
external O
right O
midfield O
player O
. O

An O
approach O
that O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
winning O
because O
it O
was O
the O
offensive O
trio O
Pirlo B-PER
- O
Sheva B-PER
- O
Josè B-PER
Mari I-PER
who O
built O
the O
winning O
action O
at O
29 O
' O
. O

Pirlo B-PER
, O
in O
fact O
, O
unhinged O
the O
adversary O
's O
defense O
by O
jumping O
over O
two O
men O
in O
midfield O
and O
from O
the O
left O
edge O
of O
the O
box O
he O
let O
go O
a O
soft O
diagonal O
for O
Shevchenko B-PER
. O

The O
latter O
, O
instead O
of O
looking O
for O
a O
volley O
, O
preferred O
to O
control O
and O
pass O
back O
to O
the O
running O
Josè B-PER
Mari I-PER
who O
shot O
right O
- O
footed O
. O

And O
' O
was O
the O
goal O
game O
, O
but O
how O
much O
effort O
to O
keep O
it O
. O

Bertolini B-PER
makes O
five O
LEVICO B-LOC
- O
Oscar B-PER
Bertolini I-PER
, O
Walter B-PER
Tomasi I-PER
and O
Gabriele B-PER
Valentini I-PER
were O
the O
undisputed O
protagonists O
of O
the O
sixth O
Daunex O
Trophy O
closing O
classic O
of O
the O
amateur O
categories O
perfectly O
organized O
by O
the O
Abici B-ORG
Team I-ORG
of O
Charlye B-PER
Bonmassar I-PER
. O

The O
success O
in O
the O
three O
- O
man O
sprint O
went O
to O
Bertolini B-PER
, O
triumphant O
for O
the O
fifth O
consecutive O
time O
in O
Levico B-LOC
. O

One O
hundred O
and O
ten O
competitors O
at O
the O
start O
to O
cover O
four O
laps O
at O
the O
lakes O
of O
Caldonazzo B-LOC
and O
Levico B-LOC
. O

At O
the O
first O
passage O
from O
Levico B-LOC
a O
quartet O
with O
Ballerin B-PER
, O
Fruet B-PER
, O
Benedetti B-PER
and O
Tomaselli B-PER
transits O
with O
about O
ten O
seconds O
on O
the O
group O
that O
is O
recomposed O
just O
past O
the O
gates O
of O
Levico B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
second O
round O
still O
all O
together O
with O
extension O
of O
' O
Alto O
Adige O
Stufer B-PER
who O
wins O
the O
flying O
finish O
line O
. O

In O
the O
third O
and O
decisive O
lap O
a O
peremptory O
action O
of O
about O
ten O
riders O
leaves O
the O
group O
at O
about O
one O
hundred O
meters O
. O

Valentini B-PER
does O
n't O
give O
up O
and O
produces O
a O
new O
sprint O
to O
which O
Bertolini B-PER
and O
Tomasi B-PER
respond O
first O
. O

Thus O
a O
trio O
of O
" O
pieces O
from O
90 O
" O
is O
formed O
that O
leaves O
no O
alternative O
to O
the O
pursuers O
. O

Last O
20 O
kilometers O
run O
all O
d O
' O
un O
fiato O
with O
the O
odometer O
fixed O
on O
45 O
hours O
. O

The O
final O
sprint O
has O
no O
history O
: O

Bertolini B-PER
shakes O
off O
first O
Valentini B-PER
and O
then O
Tomasi B-PER

a O
little O

in O

" O
It O
is O

him O

work O

him O

on O

I O
am O
curious O
to O
discover O
him O
" O
, O
the O
admission O
of O
the O
coach O
, O
as O
he O
himself O
insists O
on O
defining O
himself O

After O
the O
surprising O
glories O
of O

the O
star O

suddenly O

Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
does O
n't O
get O
upset O

" O
You O
'll O
soon O
know O
my O
intentions O
" O
. O

Since O
the O
Greens B-ORG
already O
see O
him O
as O
the O
next O
retiree O
, O
if O
they O
imagine O
him O
already O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
at O
the O
gardens O
to O
feed O
the O
pigeons O
, O
we O
asked O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
if O
he O
really O
intends O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O
race O
. O

Not O
to O
recandidate O
itself O
in O
short O
. O

" O
I O
will O
soon O
release O
the O
reserves O
- O
he O
told O
us O
yesterday O
morning O
- O
I O
think O
already O
next O
week O
or O
in O
about O
ten O
days O
. O

Do O
not O
let O
me O
say O
an O
exact O
date O
but O
it O
will O
be O
soon O
. O

I O
know O
perfectly O
well O
the O
rules O
of O
politics O
so O
I O
will O
shortly O
tell O
my O
intentions O
. O

And O
what O
does O
Ballardini B-PER
say O
about O
Valduga I-PER
's O
possible O
and O
probable O
candidacy O
? O

" O
During O
the O
election O
campaign O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
a O
dinner O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
once O
we O
went O
to O
a O
pizzeria O
but O
we O
paid O
strictly O
to O
the O
Roman O
. O

No O
evaluations O
in O
short O
, O
and O
also O
from O
this O
we O
understand O
that O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
, O
as O
he O
said O
himself O
, O
knows O
the O
" O
mechanics O
" O
of O
politics O
: O

To O
attack O
now O
a O
possible O
opposing O
candidate O
for O
mayor O
means O
to O
legitimize O
him O
before O
time O
, O
to O
give O
him O
involuntarily O
a O
push O
and O
to O
give O
him O
also O
the O
possibility O
to O
test O
the O
reactions O
of O
the O
" O
enemy O
" O
. O

So O
Ballardini B-PER
avoids O
responding O
, O
he O
gets O
away O
with O
a O
joke O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
although O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
summer O
, O
we O
are O
at O
an O
important O
political O
transition O
: O

The O
wait O
for O
the O
yes O
or O
no O
of O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
has O
a O
strategic O
importance O
. O

It O
can O
complicate O
or O
make O
things O
easier O
in O
the O
center O
left O
from O
whatever O
side O
you O
look O
at O
them O
. O

If O
he O
remains O
in O
the O
race O
his O
would O

to O
arrive O

in O

itself O

For O

, O
it O

be O

" O
But O
Pinter B-PER
's O
proposal O
- O
observes O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
, O
secretary O
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
- O
is O
on O
the O
whole O
positive O
and O
the O
road O
he O
has O
traced O
is O
certainly O
shareable O
. O

The O
leader O
of O
the O
DS B-ORG
, O
probably O
, O
would O
have O
preferred O
a O
little O
more O
courage O
. O

His O
ball O
is O
yes O
the O
single O
list O
, O
but O
of O
the O
' O
whole O
coalition O
, O
not O
just O
the O
left O
: O

" O
If O
he O
works O
for O
the O
unity O
of O
the O
left O
- O
he O
admits O
- O
I O
work O
for O
the O
unity O
of O
the O
center O
- O

. O

The O
road O
is O
that O
one O
, O
let O

see O
if O
we O
will O
stop O
at O
an O
intermediate O
stage O
or O
if O
we O
will O
go O
all O
the O
way O
. O

But O
, O
just O
to O
clarify O
, O
Bondi B-PER
assures O
that O
" O
I O
, O
on O
the O
united O
left O
, O
would O
still O
put O

of O

Sdi B-ORG
: O

" O
Pinter B-PER
's O
is O
a O
difficult O
proposal O
to O
realize O
. O

Not O
impossible O
, O
but O
difficult O
. O

Difficult O
because O
, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
clear O
the O
field O
from O
any O
" O
prejudicial O
attitude O
towards O
those O
who O
, O
on O
the O
left O
, O
think O
differently O
. O

The O
reference O
is O
obviously O
to O
the O
skirmishes O
on O
the O
reform O
of O
electoral O
law O
in O
recent O
days O
. O

" O
We O
ca O
n't O
discuss O
alliances O
and O
aggregations O
- O
confirms O
Leveghi B-PER
- O
when O
the O
contents O
are O
threatening O
. O

And O
then O
: O

" O
Let O

see O
first O
of O
all O
to O
find O
an O
agreement O
on O
the O
electoral O
law O
, O
without O
resorting O
to O
blackmail O
. O

This O
, O
at O
least O
, O
Leveghi B-PER
acknowledges O
to O
Pinter I-PER
: O

" O
In O
fact O
, O
he O
uses O
a O
method O
of O

that O
is O
very O
different O
from O
the O
one O
I O
have O
seen O
adopted O
by O

With O
these O

, O
assures O
the O

we O
can O
discuss O

, O
very O
critical O
of O
Pinter B-PER

" O
The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O

, O
instead O
of O
proposing O
content O
, O
are O
trying O
to O
tie O
Dellai B-PER
to O
an O
alliance O
by O

. O

The O
risk O
is O
that O
Dellai B-PER
accepts O
the O
challenge O
, O
if O
he O
plays O
it O
and O
goes O
to O
win O
everything O
at O

of O
a O

Pinter B-PER

only O
a O

works O
by O
Fortunato B-PER

But O
how O
many O
paintings O

drawings O
belonged O
to O
the O
former O
secretary O
of O
the O
PSI B-ORG
and O
today O
to O
his O
family O
? O

We O
asked O
the O
critic O
Maurizio B-PER
Scudiero I-PER
, O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
experts O
of O
the O
work O
of O

He O
remembers O
especially O
a O
piece O
, O
really O
valuable O
from O
the O
historical O
point O
of O
view O
, O
which O
was O
given O
to O
Bettino B-PER
right O
here O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC

" O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
' O
80s O
- O
says O
Scudiero B-PER
- O
I O
went O
to O
Craxi B-PER
's O
house O
in O
Milan O
to O
see O
some O
of O
Depero B-PER
's O
paintings O
. O

I O
had O
seen O
them O
on O
a O
furniture O
magazine O
and O
I O
asked O
the O
family O
if O
I O
could O
see O
them O
. O

They O
were O
ten O
or O
so O
, O
arranged O
on O
a O
long O
wall O
that O
was O
behind O
his O
work O
table O
. O

He O
was O
n't O
there O
that O
day O
, O
if O
I O
remember O
correctly O
, O
his O
wife O
was O
there O
and O
she O
asked O
me O
for O
an O
opinion O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
too O
unbuttoned O
. O

They O
were O
beautiful O
but O
they O
were O
not O
historical O
works O
, O
most O
of O
them O
had O
been O
purchased O
at O
the O
Cortina B-ORG
Gallery I-ORG
in O
Milan B-LOC

One O
, O
however O
, O
came O
from O
here O
, O
from O
Rovereto B-LOC

" O
That O
's O
a O
very O
interesting O
work O
. O

An O
Indian O
ink O
" O
The O
Panther O
" O
that O
was O
given O
to O
Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER
in O
January O
of O
' O
89 O
when O
the O
then O
secretary O
of O
the O
PSI B-ORG
came O
to O
visit O
Mart B-ORG

It O
inaugurated O
the O
largest O
exhibition O
of O

, O
I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
curators O
, O
and O
was O
the O
one O
that O
gave O

to O

On O
that O
occasion O
it O
was O
given O
, O
I O
think O
by O
the O
PSI B-ORG
Federation I-ORG
, O
to O
Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER
the O
ink O
that O
belonged O
to O
a O
collector O
from O
Trentino O
. O

A O
' O
work O
of O
' O
13 O
important O
because O
it O
belongs O
to O
Depero B-PER
who O
was O
about O
to O
move O
to O
Futurism O
. O

Among O
the O
things O
I O
saw O
in O
Milan B-LOC
there O
were O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
canvases O
, O
some O
" O
dustings O
" O
, O
creations O
of O
the O
artist O
derived O
from O
the O
initial O
drawing O
. O

I O
remember O
one O
of O
them O
, O
" O
Sticks O
and O
Cane O
" O
. O

However O
, O
Craxi B-PER
liked O
Depero B-PER
very O
much O
, O
he O
was O
someone O
who O
understood O
Futurist O
art O
. O

He O
had O
a O
connoisseur O
's O
taste O
as O
far O
as O
Fortunato B-PER
Depero I-PER
was O
concerned O
. O

And O
in O
fact O
the O
" O
Panther O
" O
is O
a O
connoisseur O
's O
piece O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
question O
of O
economic O
value O
, O
but O
above O
all O
of O
artistic O
value O
. O

" O
He O
was O
a O
Depero B-PER
- O
says O
Squire B-PER
- O
still O
expressionist O
, O
futurist O
traces O
begin O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
these O
stars O
. O

Beyond O
the O
historical O
- O
artistic O
aspects O
, O
today O
it O
is O
a O
memory O
of O
an O
era O
recalled O
by O
the O
article O
of O
the O
Corriere B-ORG
, O
which O
focused O
on O
the O
Deperos O
of O
the O
villa O
in O
Hammamet B-LOC
, O
describing O
them O
as O
a O
" O
treasure O
" O
. O

That O
" O
treasure O
" O
that O
in O
the O
years O
when O
Craxi B-PER
was O
Evil O
was O
described O
in O
the O
press O
and O
on O

as O
something O
galactic O
: O

It O
was O
even O
spoken O
of O
a O

Now O
, O
instead O
, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
the O
Tunisian O
villa O
is O
not O
that O

the O
case O
of O
the O
wellness O
center O
that O
obtained O
a O
substantial O
contribution O
from O
the O
Province B-LOC
as O
part O
of O
the O
financing O
of O
the O
territorial O
pact O
, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
located O
in O
Ravina B-LOC
, O
a O
good O
twenty O
kilometers O
from O
what O
is O
normally O
defined O
as O
the O
Bondone B-LOC
area O
? O

From O
this O
, O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
, O
the O
provincial O
councilor O
of O
the O
Sdr B-ORG
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
( O
as O
well O
as O
his O
colleague O
Denis B-PER
Bertolini I-PER
) O
had O
started O
to O
present O
a O
' O
question O
to O
President O
Pallaoro B-PER
. O

The O
objective O
was O
to O
know O
the O
punctual O
list O
of O
all O
the O
realized O
investments O
and O
of O
those O
programmed O
with O
the O
contributions O
of O
the O
public O
body O
. O

Bondi B-PER
, O
in O
particular O
, O
wondered O
about O
the O
purpose O
of O
a O
series O
of O
" O
very O
varied O
interventions O
and O
not O
always O
immediately O
referable O
to O
a O
general O
plan O
for O
the O
relaunching O
of O
Monte B-LOC
Bondone I-LOC
" O
. O

Well O
, O
from O
the O
answer O
given O
by O
the O
Councillor O
for O
Planning O
Gianluca B-PER
Salvatori I-PER
, O
very O
interesting O
data O
emerges O
. O

There O
are O
472 O
investment O
requests O
from O
private O
individuals O
considered O
consistent O
by O
the O
public O
body O
, O
for O
an O
amount O
of O
almost O
107 O
million O
euros O
. O

A O
large O
part O
of O
them O
are O
for O
sectors O
that O
are O
universally O
considered O
to O
be O
driving O
forces O
for O
the O
relaunch O
of O
Bondone B-LOC
: O

tourism O
( O
76 O
million O
) O
, O
ski O
slopes O
and O
facilities O
( O
11 O
million O
) O
and O
agritourism O
( O
2 O
million O
) O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
, O
however O
, O
that O
within O
the O
contributions O
that O
Piazza B-LOC
Dante I-LOC
is O
giving O
to O
bring O
back O
to O
life O
the O
mountain O
of O
Trento B-LOC
, O
in O
addition O
to O
several O
hundred O
euros O
for O
the O
replacement O
of O
boilers O
and O
for O
the O
renovation O
of O
the O
facades O
of O
the O
houses O
, O
there O
are O
requests O
for O
contributions O
for O
640,000 O
euros O
that O
will O
be O
used O
for O
the O
renovation O
of O
retaining O
walls O
, O
fences O
and O
construction O
of O
reinforced O
soil O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
. O

Almost O
a O
million O
and O
100 O
thousand O
euros O
have O
been O
asked O
for O
the O
realization O
of O
new O
orchards O
, O
the O
construction O
of O
irrigation O
systems O
and O
anti O
- O
hail O
covers O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
think O
of O
a O
plant O
of O
cherry O
trees O
in O
Bondone B-LOC
, O
near O
the O
slopes O
, O
perhaps O
positioned O
so O
that O
skiers O
make O
the O
slalom O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
you O
are O
very O
wrong O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Sopramonte B-LOC
and O
Sardagna B-LOC
, O
which O
are O
still O
part O
of O
the O
Bondone B-LOC
district I-LOC
or O
are O
closely O
tied O
to O
it O
, O
the O
new O
cultivations O
will O
also O
rise O
in O
the O
plain O
, O
for O
example O
in O
Romagnano B-LOC
. O

So O
on O
the O
table O
of O
the O
Trade O
Service O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
has O
also O
arrived O
the O
request O
for O
a O
grant O
of O
368,000 O
euros O
from O
the O
" O
Locanda B-ORG
Margon I-ORG
srl I-ORG
" O
owned O
by O
a O
company O
that O
refers O
to O
the O
Lunelli B-PER
of O
Ferrari B-ORG
wineries I-ORG
. O

They O
will O
be O
used O
for O
the O
purchase O
of O
equipment O
and O
furnishings O
in O
the O
renovation O
of O
the O
former O
restaurant O
Marlene O
in O
Ravina B-LOC
. O

The O
opening O
of O
the O
inn O
of O
the O
Lunelli B-PER
brothers O
and O
cousins O
has O
already O
been O
declared O
coherent O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
aims O
of O
the O
Bondone B-LOC
agreement O
, O
as O
it O
is O
part O
of O
the O
territory O
that O
can O
obtain O
the O
facilities O
. O

Now O
the O
Province B-LOC
will O
have O
to O
carry O
out O
a O
preliminary O
investigation O
in O
order O
to O
verify O
if O
the O
goods O
for O
the O
purchase O
of O
which O
the O
request O
has O
been O
presented O
are O
eligible O
and O
if O
the O
expense O
is O
congruous O
. O

On O
the O
costs O
that O
will O
be O
considered O
instrumental O
to O
the O
' O
business O
initiative O
, O
the O
Trade O
Service O
will O
apply O
a O
contribution O
that O
averages O
between O
30 O
and O
40 O
percent O
of O
expenditure O
. O

In O
its O
answer O
to O
Bondi B-PER
Salvatori B-PER
writes O
that O
the O
objective O
of O
the O
pacts O
is O
to O
promote O
a O
" O
development O
from O
the O
bottom O
with O
concerted O
projects O
" O
. O

Romagnano B-LOC
and O
Ravina B-LOC
are O
200 O
meters O
above O

, O
the O
Palon B-LOC
is O
almost O
at O
2,100 O
. O

More O
from O
below O
than O
this O
is O
difficult O
. O

For O
not O
having O
consulted O
the O
municipality B-LOC
on O
the O
new O
law O
and O
not O
having O
activated O
the O
' O

In O

to O

" O
I O
read O
that O
within O
a O
few O
days O
will O
be O
ready O
the O
addresses O
of O
the O

the O

I O
would O
like O
that O
on O
such O
important O
topics O
also O
the O
Municipality B-LOC

would O
be O
interested O

Giovanna B-ORG
Fadanelli I-ORG
( O
Margherita B-ORG
) O
, O
president O
of O

, O
does O
not O
send O
them O
to O
say O
to O
the O
provincial O
councillor O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
that O
the O
other O
day O
presented O
a O
preview O
of O
the O
guidelines O
of O
the O
draft O

that O
will O
soon O
go O
to O
the O

She O
asks O
why O
, O
in O
view O
of O
such O
an O
important O
step O
, O
the O
participation O
of O
the O
city O
has O
not O
been O
requested O
. O

" O
I O
think O
that O
the O
capital O
at O
this O
juncture O
would O
have O
had O
something O
important O
to O
say O
, O
if O
only O
to O
concert O
themes O
and O
objectives O
of O
this O
new O
rule O
. O

Yesterday O
evening O
, O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Federation B-ORG
of I-ORG
Choirs I-ORG
, O
Sergio B-PER
Franceschinelli I-PER
, O
was O
present O
in O
the O
Municipal O
Culture O
Commission O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
vitality O
of O
the O
33 O
choirs O
( O
for O
a O
total O
of O
878 O
choristers O
) O
that O
live O
in O
the O
territory O
of O
Trento B-LOC
. O

A O
constantly O
growing O
reality O
that O
has O
been O
able O
to O
involve O
young O
people O
while O
maintaining O
a O
link O
with O
the O
traditional O
world O
. O

On O
the O
controversy O
with O
Cogo B-PER
Franceschinelli B-PER
preferred O
to O
gloss O
over O
, O
explaining O
, O
however O
, O
to O
have O
sent O
in O
Piazza B-LOC
Dante I-LOC
a O
reply O
rather O
hard O
to O
the O
statements O
made O
by O
the O
' O
councillor O
to O
l B-ORG
' I-ORG
Adige I-ORG
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
perhaps O
in O
response O
to O
Cogo B-PER
who O
asks O
for O
more O
space O
for O
modern O
culture O
, O
the O
choirs O
will O
soon O
start O
with O
a O
project O
for O
the O
rediscovery O
of O
the O
popular O
tradition O
of O
material O
and O
ancient O
crafts O
( O
cellar O
, O
plow O
, O
mill O
) O
. O

Perhaps O
stormy O
, O
but O
at O
least O
with O
the O
Province B-LOC
there O
are O
relationships O
. O

" O
With O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
- O
continues O
the O
president O
- O
they O
are O
rather O
sporadic O
. O

On O
our O
side O
there O
is O
full O
availability O
to O
collaborate O
, O
but O
we O
have O
never O
had O
any O
great O
requests O
. O

The O
example O
given O
by O
Fransceschinelli B-PER
is O
a O
very O
topical O
one O
: O

" O
For O
the O
initiative O
" O
Trento B-LOC
alpine O
city O
" O
we O
could O
have O
participated O
, O
but O
nobody O
has O
never O
interpellated O
us O
. O

These O
declarations O
have O
made O
the O
entire O
commission O
shudder O
, O
convinced O
that O
with O
the O
approval O
, O
even O
last O
year O
, O
of O
the O
cultural O
plan O
, O
the O
city O
administration O
had O
set O
in O
motion O
to O
carry O
out O
a O
survey O
of O
associations O
, O
groups O
, O
individuals O
who O
do O
cultural O
activities O
in O
the O
area O
. O

It O
can O
be O
said O
, O
" O
summarized O
Diano B-PER
, O
supported O
by O
Fadanelli B-PER
and O
Ragozzino B-PER
, O
" O
that O
the O
plan O
remained O
only O
on O
paper O
. O

Among O
what O
had O
been O
established O
, O
the O
first O
point O
was O
the O
' O
establishment O
of O
an O
observatory O
that O
monitors O
the O
cultural O
ferment O
of O
the O
city O
. O

We O
discover O
, O
however O
, O
that O
Bertoldi B-PER
has O
not O
contacted O
anyone O
, O
not O
even O
a O
federation O
structured O
and O
rooted O

out O

an O

: O

" O

these O

" O
That O

enough O

, O

So O
it O
was O
urgently O
convened O
a O
summit O
of O
the O
center O

left O
Trentino O
who O
decided O
to O
give O
a O
peremptory O
ultimatum O
: O

" O
Necessarily O
by O
January O

the O
Patt B-ORG
must O
decide O

The O
decision O
of O
Patt B-ORG
to O
postpone O
everything O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
month O
has O
in O
fact O
disrupted O
the O

the O

where O
a O

was O
convened O
for O

The O
fly O
in O

had O
also O
jumped O
to O
the O
SVP B-ORG

who O
did O
not O
like O
the O

" O

and O
that O
with O
the O
center O

left O
Trentino O
could O
decide O
to O
make O
a O
regional O

ignoring O
the O
Patt B-ORG

Even O
if O
on O
this O
side O
the O
Volkspartei B-ORG
will O
first O
have O
to O
solve O
the O

Yesterday O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
relations O
with O

all O
met O
in O
the O

to O
examine O
the O
issue O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
, O
a O
decisive O
statement O
was O
issued O
in O
which O
the O
center O
- O
left O
expressed O
: O

" O
great O
concern O
" O
. O

However O
, O
the O
political O
and O
programmatic O
confrontation O
with O
Patt B-ORG
has O
been O
substantially O
positive O
. O

The O
center O
- O
left O
forces O
underline O
that O
" O
by O
common O
agreement O
with O
all O
the O
provincial O
group O
leaders O
, O
including O
Patt B-ORG
, O
the O
next O

meeting O
has O
been O
set O
for O
Tuesday O
January O
26th O
. O

Given O
these O
deadlines O
, O
the O
center O
- O
left O
coalition O
believes O
that O
necessarily O
by O
Saturday O
, O
January O
23 O
Patt B-ORG
, O
as O
previously O
publicly O
announced O
and O
agreed O
, O
must O
decide O
. O

It O
is O
hoped O
that O
this O
decision O
will O
be O
taken O
positively O
, O
completing O
the O
hypotheses O
of O
agreement O
that O
are O
collegially O
working O
for O
weeks O
now O
. O

Otherwise O
- O
continues O
the O
note O
- O
first O
of O
all O
out O
of O
respect O
for O
institutional O
obligations O
and O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
responsibility O
assumed O
before O
the O
voters O
, O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
serious O
shock O
and O
upset O
that O
is O
emerging O
in O
the O
' O
public O
opinion O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
the O
coalition O
of O
the O
center O
- O
left O
will O
consider O
it O
necessary O
and O
urgent O
to O
take O
all O
the O
political O
and O
institutional O
initiatives O
necessary O
for O
the O
proper O
functioning O
of O
the O
provincial O
council O
of O
Trento O
and O
for O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
provincial O
and O
regional O
governments O
. O

Out O
of O
metaphor O
, O
the O
center O
- O
left O
intends O
to O
wait O
until O
Saturday O
, O
but O
then O
will O
begin O
to O
" O
look O
around O
" O
. O

All O
deny O
that O
there O
are O
already O
other O
contacts O
in O
progress O
with O
the O
" O
Center O
" O
. O
But O
it O
is O
logical O
to O
expect O
that O
the O
coalition O
of O
Dellai B-PER
somehow O
try O
to O
find O
an O
eighteenth O
essential O
vote O
to O
make O
the O
majority O
. O

In O
yesterday O

: O

" O

Dellai I-PER

in O

has O
served O
to O
clarify O
matters O
, O
but O
in O
some O
ways O
it O
has O
also O
brought O
a O
cold O
shower O
. O

Clarity O
because O
it O
is O
now O
certain O
that O
the O
territorial O
party O
will O
not O
be O
there O
: O

Ds B-ORG
and O

will O
present O
themselves O
together O
, O
with O

as O
the O

, O
as O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O

And O
the O
cold O
shower O
? O

Yes O
, O
because O
it O
is O
understood O
that O
the O
Volkspartei B-ORG
from O
Bolzano B-LOC
has O
a O
direct O
line O
to O
Rome B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
Gianclaudio B-PER

will O
have O
to O
be O
" O
arranged O
" O
in O
the O
regional B-ORG
Union I-ORG
, O
taking O
away O
space O
from O
a O
Trentino O
candidate O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
more O
hope O
: O

If O
Bressa B-PER
himself O
were O
to O
be O
called O
to O
the O
government O
, O
he O
could O
leave O
the O
place O
of O
deputy O
to O
the O
first O
of O
the O
unelected O
. O

AUTONOMISTS O
. O

It O
seems O
now O
certain O
the O
" O
passage O
" O
of O
Patt B-ORG
from O
the O
proportional O
Union B-ORG
to O
the O
Volkspartei B-ORG
. O

The O
candidate O
could O
be O
Giacomo B-PER
Bezzi I-PER
( O
or O
Franco B-PER
Panizza I-PER
as O
an O
alternative O
) O
. O

The O
autonomists O
expected O
a O
different O
treatment O
from O
Margherita B-ORG
and O
now O
the O
dream O
, O
not O
so O
much O
secret O
, O
is O
to O
have O
the O
fourth O
deputy O
elected O
to O
the O
Edelweiss B-ORG
and O
to O
" O
take O
him O
away O
" O
from O
the O
Union B-ORG
. O

A O
way O
to O
make O
Patt B-ORG
's O
votes O
count O
once O
and O
for O
all O
. O

Giacomo B-PER
Bezzi I-PER
however O
denies O
any O
warlike O
intent O
: O

" O
We O
had O
guaranteed O
our O
presence O
on O
two O
conditions O
: O

That O
the O
autonomist O
reunification O
was O
accomplished O
and O
that O
there O
was O
a O
project O
with O
Margherita B-ORG
and O
Ds B-ORG
. O

We O
do O
not O
change O
our O
minds O
. O

But O
the O
space O
conquered O
by O
Bressa B-PER
with O
Prodi B-PER
's O
blessing O
risks O
making O
the O
race O
towards O
Rome B-LOC
of O
the O
Civic B-ORG
Trentino I-ORG
much O
more O
difficult O
. O

The O
Patt B-ORG
that O
takes O
away O
a O
seat O
from O
Margherita B-ORG
: O

It O
would O
be O
a O
mockery O
for O

who O
wanted O

The O

Just O
a O

The O
cleanings O

always O

every O

: O

Then O
, O
since O
the O

we O
must O
say O
whether O
it O
has O
reduced O
the O

if O

During O
the O

that O
followed O
the O

Putin B-PER
reiterated O
that O
for O
Russia B-LOC
the O
framework O
of O
world O
security O
has O
as O
its O
cornerstone O
the O
Abm O
Treaty O
of O
1972 O
. O

" O
Any O
unilateral O
initiative O
- O
he O
added O
- O
could O
cause O
many O
complications O
" O
. O

Like O
his O
American O
colleague O
, O
Putin B-PER
did O
not O
hide O
the O
differences O
that O
emerged O
during O
the O
talks O
, O
which O
he O
described O
as O
" O
very O
open O
and O
very O
interesting O
" O
. O

" O
We O
have O
assessed O
the O
past O
, O
the O
present O
and O
the O
future O
of O
our O
countries O
- O
said O
the O
Russian O
president O
- O
we O
have O
found O
an O
excellent O
basis O
for O
developing O
our O
cooperation O
, O
but O
we O
can O
not O
overcome O
in O
a O
moment O
the O
differences O
that O
exist O
between O
us O
. O

" O
We O
will O
start O
from O
those O
elements O
that O
unite O
us O
, O
the O
threats O
should O
be O
defined O
exactly O
and O
it O
is O
better O
to O
do O
it O
together O
" O
. O
Putin B-PER
added O
that O
he O
announced O
the O
opening O
of O
a O
negotiating O
table O
on O
security O
that O
will O
be O
entrusted O
to O
the O
foreign O
and O
defense O
ministers O
. O

Bush B-PER
also O
stressed O
the O
difficulties O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
showed O
that O
he O
considers O
them O
as O
a O
starting O
point O
. O

" O
We O
speak O
differently O
, O
but O
we O
know O
- O
said O
the O
American O
president O
- O
Russia B-LOC
is O
an O
important O
country O
, O
we O
can O
cooperate O
in O
a O
meaningful O
way O
" O
. O

And O
he O
offered O
Putin B-PER
a O
certificate O
of O
credit O
. O

" O
I O
have O
looked O
into O
the O
eyes O
of O
this O
man O
- O
Bush B-PER
said O
, O
repeating O
what O
Ronald B-PER
Reagan I-PER
said O
about O
Mikhail B-PER
Gorbachev I-PER
- O
he O
is O
worth O
believing O
in O
, O
we O
have O
given O
him O
our O
trust O
" O
. O

Bush B-PER
has O
guaranteed O
the O
economic O
commitment O
of O
the O
USA B-LOC
towards O
Russia B-LOC
assuring O
the O
next O
arrival O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
of O

. O

He O
then O
reiterated O
the O
necessity O
of O
NATO B-ORG
enlargement O
. O

" O
It O
will O
be O
a O
wise O
thing O
- O
the O
American O
president O
said O
- O
Russia B-LOC
will O
have O
friends O
on O
its O
borders O
. O

Putin B-PER
has O
first O
recalled O
a O
secret O
document O
of O
1954 O
that O
excluded O
any O
possible O
collaboration O
and O
then O
went O
back O
to O
a O
very O
different O
present O
. O

" O
NATO B-ORG
is O
not O
an O
enemy O
of O
Russia B-LOC
- O
he O
said O
- O
but O
it O
is O
necessary O

establish O

it O

a O

not O

the O

a O
new O

Maroni B-PER

" O
excluded O
that O

In O

The O
President O

agrees O
with O
me O
that O
this O
is O
the O
text O
of O

that O
it O
is O
harmful O
to O

it O

the O
impression O

Referring O

Alemanno B-PER

of O
a O
position O

" O
without O

Berlusconi B-PER
also O
expressed O
his O
" O
personal O
opinion O
" O
saying O
he O
does O
not O
believe O
that O
Iraq B-LOC
has O
weapons O
of O

destruction O
" O
not O
because O
there O
could O
not O
be O
any O
, O
but O
because O
there O
has O
been O
time O
for O
their O
elimination O
or O
different O
allocation O
" O
. O

Berlusconi B-PER
, O
added O
in O
the O
evening O
to O
have O
reported O
what O
is O
also O
Putin B-PER
's O
conviction O
. O

The O
Italian O
Prime O
Minister O
on O
his O
third O
official O
visit O
to O
Russia B-LOC
since O
he O
is O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
current O
government O
, O
was O
received O
by O
Putin B-PER
at O
the O
Kremlin O
, O
where O
he O
stayed O
for O
a O
working O
breakfast O
. O

" O
I O
continue O
to O
believe O
that O
on O
a O
practical O
level O
- O
Berlusconi B-PER
said O
in O
a O
meeting O
with O
the O
Italian O
press O
- O
it O
would O
have O
been O
more O
appropriate O
a O
resolution O
" O
that O
in O
case O
of O
verification O
of O
non O
- O
compliance O
with O
UN B-ORG
decisions O
by O
Iraq O
would O
provide O
for O
an O
immediate O

action O

" O
But O
things O
have O
gone O
in O
a O
different O
direction O
. O

From O
Putin B-PER
Berlusconi B-PER
, O
however O
, O
Berlusconi O
obtained O
a O
renewed O
" O
yes O
" O
to O
the O
adoption O
of O
a O
" O
strong O
" O
UN B-ORG
resolution O
on O
the O
mission O
of O
UN B-ORG
inspectors O
who O
, O
the O
Russian O
president O
noted O
, O
must O
go O
to O
Iraq B-LOC
" O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
order O
to O
remove O
all O
the O
concerns O
of O
the O

. O

Russia B-LOC
has O
been O
convinced O
by O
British O
Prime O
Minister O
Tony B-PER
Blair I-PER
and O
by O
my O
insistence O
, O
" O
Berlusconi B-PER
said O
, O
" O
not O
to O
oppose O
a O
strong O
resolution O
concerning O
the O
visit O
of O
the O
inspectors O
and O
the O
possibility O
to O
investigate O
fully O
, O
without O
constraints O
and O
without O
limitations O
, O
even O
in O
the O
presidential O
palaces O
, O
the O
existence O
or O
not O
of O

of O

destruction O
. O

If O
the O
inspections O
should O
find O
Iraqi O
non O
- O
compliance O
, O
for O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
" O
it O
will O
be O
easy O
to O
resort O
to O
a O
new O
UN B-ORG
resolution O
that O
gives O
space O
for O
armed O
intervention O
. O

We O
are O
convinced O
that O
the O
Iraqi O
situation O
is O
worrying O
for O
everyone O
. O
Berlusconi B-PER
then O
remarked O
in O
response O
to O
those O
who O
asked O
him O
for O
clarification O
on O
the O
new O
position O
taken O
by O
Italy B-LOC
, O
but O
" O
we O
are O
pragmatic O
" O
. O

The O
Italian O
one O
made O
explicit O
yesterday O
" O
is O
a O
position O

that O

not O
take O
sides O
neither O
on O

on O

" O
. O

The O
Prime O

then O
reiterated O
that O
he O
felt O
" O
in O
tune O
" O
with O
Blair B-PER
and O
Bush B-PER
, O
but O
also O
that O
" O
we O
must O
be O

" O
. O

Adding O
that O
" O
the O

no O

Yesterday O

sure O
that O

: O

" O
Arafat B-PER

whether O
he O
prefers O

" O
We O

now O
lacking O
the O

of O

Barak B-PER
may O

about O

: O

" O
I O
like O
to O
sing O
about O
true O
love O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
romantic O
vision O
, O
dying O
for O
love O
, O
I O
like O
it O
very O
much O
. O

In O
my O
songs O
there O
is O
an O
attempt O
of O
abandonment O
to O
passion O
and O
an O
attempt O
to O
become O
self O

sufficient O
and O
not O
to O
make O
a O
person O
a O
point O

About O
concerts O
: O

" O
The O
concert O
is O
for O
me O
what O
comes O
to O
me O
and O
that O
I O
reflect O
. O

It O
's O
the O
people O
's O
breath O
, O
the O
clapping O
of O
hands O
, O
the O
singing O
out O
of O
tune O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
see O
a O
concert O
without O
people O
, O
as O
I O
usually O
feel O
bad O
in O
a O
recording O
room O
because O
there O
are O
no O
people O
there O
. O

For O
me O
, O
singing O
makes O
sense O
if O
there O
are O
people O
. O

On O
the O
subject O
of O

: O

" O
I O
associate O
the O
attitude O

Carmen B-PER

has O
always O

Gilda B-PER

Why O
is O
Carmen B-PER
Consoli I-PER
called O
the O
" O
singeress B-PER
" O
? O

" O
It O
all O
happened O
when O
Carmen B-PER
was O
in O
the O
recording O
studio O
with O
the O
South O
African O
sound O
engineer O
Allan B-PER
Goldberg I-PER
. O

She O
and O
a O
friend O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
him O
to O
learn O
the O
use O
of O
the O
feminine O
in O
the O
Italian O
language O
. O

To O
make O
him O
understand O
it O
better O
, O
they O
took O
a O
dog O
named O
Mela O
as O
a O
guinea O
pig O
. O

They O
told O
him O
that O
in O
Italian O
a O
female O
dog O
is O
called O
" O
Canessa O
" O
. O

Allan B-PER
Goldberg I-PER
used O
the O
suffix O
" O
it O
" O
for O
the O
other O
names O
as O
well O
. O

Since O
the O
noun O
" O
singer O
" O
sounded O
bad O
for O
Carmen B-PER
, O
he O
called O
her O
" O
cantantessa O
" O
. O

Hence O
the O
origin O
of O
her O
nickname O
, O
which O
has O
entered O
the O
hearts O
of O
many O

of O

TRENTO B-LOC
- O
It O
's O
arrived O
the O
day O
in O
which O
it O
closes O
also O
the O
third O
book O
of O
the O
adventure O
of O
Gigi B-PER
Capuzzo I-PER
in O
Gialloblù O
. O

The O
first O
one O
talked O
about O
a O
striker O
with O
a O
bright O
career O
, O
" O
better O
when O
he O
was O
young O
, O
than O
later O
" O
( O
as O
Gigetto B-PER
himself O
says O
) O
that O
in O
Trento B-ORG
brought O
plays O
from O
a O
real O
point O
of O
the O
penalty O
area O
and O
a O
dozen O
goals O
. O

In O
the O
second O
part O
he O
told O
the O
story O
of O
a O
technician O
with O
great O
human O
qualities O
, O
finished O
by O
chance O
in O
the O
wrong O
place O
at O
the O
right O
time O
: O

in O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
inevitable O
societal O
jolts O
due O
to O
the O
passage O
of O
hand O
between O
the O
old O
management O
and O
the O
current O
involved O
him O
, O
beyond O
any O
demerit O
; O

Gigetto B-PER
paid O
in O
person O
: O

He O
was O
" O
resigned O
" O
. O
He O
was O
then O
recalled O
and O
brought O
Trento B-ORG
to O
safety O
; O

A O
situation O
not O
easy O
to O
patch O
up O
, O
when O
you O
start O
to O
win O
and O
you O
are O
one O
step O
away O
from O
the O
abyss O
of O
a O
humiliating O
relegation O
to O
the O
regional O
championships O
. O

The O
third O
tome O
closes O
today O
: O

Capuzzo B-PER
did O
what O
was O
asked O
of O
him O
with O
a O
team O
that O
could O
hardly O
have O
given O
more O
: O

The O
eleven O
holder O
- O
as O
the O
technician O
has O
always O
admitted O
- O
to O
level O
of O
the O
best O
in O
absolute O
( O
Pavia B-PER
and O
Fanfulla B-PER
) O
; O

but O
troubles O
and O
various O
vicissitudes O
have O
often O
clipped O
the O
wings O
to O
the O
aquilotti O
. O

The O
third O
place O
up O
for O
grabs O
in O
Pizzighettone B-LOC
today O
( O
in O
case O
of O
victory O
would O
be O
certain O
, O
even O
if O
probably O
in O
cohabitation O
) O
would O
represent O
a O
fair O
prize O
( O
and O
a O
recognition O
) O
to O
the O
professionalism O
of O
a O
group O
that O
the O
defeat O
against O
the O
Oggiono B-ORG
has O
risked O
to O
undermine O
the O
foundations O
. O

But O
in O
certain O
situations O
the O
" O
good O
" O
company O
helps O
; O

And O
what O
has O
happened O
, O
at O
other O
levels O
, O
to O
' O
Inter B-ORG
helps O
to O
lighten O
the O
load O
of O
that O
defeat O
. O

Match O
for O
the O
greetings O
, O
and O
for O
a O
redemption O
that O
Capuzzo B-PER
asks O
to O
the O
players O
; O

Some O
will O
remain O
( O
if O
it O
has O
already O
been O
written O
) O
, O
others O
will O
pack O
their O
bags O
. O

As O
it O
happens O
to O
Gigi B-PER
who O
would O
have O
wanted O
with O
all O
his O
heart O
to O
write O
the O
fourth O
volume O
of O
his O
Gialloblù O
experience O
; O

That O
, O
he O
hoped O
, O
of O
the O
return O
among O
the O
professors O
. O

Instead O
it O
will O
have O
to O
concentrate O
on O
the O
podium O
; O

He O
will O
try O
to O
put O
his O
foot O
on O
it O
definitively O
, O
having O
to O
scrape O
the O
barrel O
in O
the O

good O
effervescence O
between O

even O
if O
without O

in O
the O
first O
ten O
minutes O
. O

At O
12 O
' O
Mezzocorona B-PER
is O
the O
first O
to O
dare O
with O
a O
nice O
launch O
of O
the O
inspired O
Mariotti B-PER
for O
the O
head O
of O
Vianello B-PER
that O
does O
not O
surprise O
Venuto B-PER
. O

We O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
26 O
' O
for O
the O
first O
advantage O
born O
from O
a O
nice O
combination O
Pontalti B-PER

that O
allows O

to O
penetrate O
from O
the O
left O
, O
lob O
on O

Franceschinis B-PER
' O
rebound O
on O
the O
line O

Vianello B-PER
( O

definitively O
repeats O
in O
the O
net O
with O
the O

The O

lasts O

The O
game O
remains O
alive O
and O
after O
a O
central O
Vianello B-PER

kick O
, O
Sanvitese B-PER
is O
again O
dangerous O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
offside O
line O
with O
Fantini B-PER
who O
tries O
a O
lob O
, O
but O
finds O
the O
recovery O
of O

Mezzocorona B-PER
finds O
the O
advantage O
again O
at O
40 O
' O
when O
Mariotti B-PER
steals O
the O
ball O
on O
the O
three O

the O

after O
a O
few O
months O
of O
fasting O
. O

Even O
this O
time O
, O
however O
, O
Sanvitese B-PER
is O
quick O
to O
find O
the O
equaliser O
with O
Fantini B-PER
who O
from O
the O
right O
puts O
the O
ball O
in O
the O
middle O
and O
finds O
the O
usual O
Rossi B-PER
ready O
in O
the O
area O
for O
the O
winning O
deviation O
. O

In O
the O
second O
half O
the O
pace O
drops O
even O
if O
Rossi B-PER
, O
at O
5 O

, O
scares O
Basso B-PER
with O
a O
cross O
shot O
from O
the O
left O
side O
that O
is O
blocked O
by O
the O
goalkeeper O
. O

Shortly O
after O
Francescato B-PER
sinks O
on O
the O
left O
and O
puts O
a O
dangerous O
ball O
in O
the O
area O
that O
does O
not O
find O
anyone O
. O

At O
15 O
' O
but O
here O
is O
the O
network O
of O
the O
victory O
that O
comes O
from O
a O
Friulian O
' O
initiative O
of O
the O
usual O
Rossi B-PER
, O
good O
to O
run O
on O
the O

the O

between O

little O

Some O
doubt O
about O
the O
position O
of O
Fantini B-PER
( O
who O
makes O
a O
veil O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
) O
, O
but O
the O
network O
is O
validated O
. O

The O
hosts O
throw O
themselves O
forward O
in O
search O
of O
an O
equaliser O
but O
in O
the O
remaining O
half O
hour O
the O
red O
and O
white O
defence O
always O
keeps O
a O
good O
guard O
with O
several O
players O
. O

At O
33 O
' O
there O
is O
a O
good O
combination O
of O
Baido B-PER

Vianello B-PER
- O
Mariotti B-PER
that O
allows O
the O
Solandro O
forward O
to O
conclude O

on O

After O
a O
counter O

On O

the O

the O
many O

how O

Stefania B-PER
Belmondo I-PER
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
recalled O
the O
difficulties O
encountered O
in O
reaching O
certain O
results O
, O
such O
as O
the O
breakage O
of O
a O
stick O
that O
can O
compromise O
the O
years O
of O
preparation O
in O
the O
most O
important O

The O
former O

Belluti B-PER
then O
illustrated O
his O
role O
as O
representative O
of O

the O
difficulties O
, O
above O
all O
of O
an O

nature O
, O
that O
this O

. O

There O
was O
no O
lack O
of O
questions O
about O
the O
unedifying O
aspects O
of O

such O
as O
doping O
: O

The O
champions O
stressed O
that O
these O
aspects O
, O
especially O
at O
the O
level O
of O
information O
organs O
, O
can O
not O
obscure O
the O
promotion O
and O
the O
results O
of O

, O
especially O
those O
less O
promoted O

that O
at O

" O

President O
Andreotti B-PER
, O
does O
this O
make O
you O
happy O
? O

No O
, O
not O
at O
all O
. O

Much O
less O
do O
I O
feel O
satisfaction O
for O
these O
difficulties O
of O
Dellai B-PER
, O
with O
whom O
I O
have O
an O
excellent O
relationship O
. O

But O
it O
's O
when O
they O
are O
loudly O
denied O
by O
the O
newspapers O
that O
I O
'm O
happy O
. O

We O
have O
been O
considered O
traitors O
because O
we O
have O
postponed O
every O
decision O
, O
but O
from O
the O
stalemate O
in O
the O
negotiations O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
even O
if O
there O
had O
been O
the O
Patt B-ORG
parliament O
, O
nothing O
would O
have O
been O
done O
.... O

But O
the O
distance O
from O
the O
center O
- O
left O
on O
the O
Region B-LOC
has O
decreased O
. O

They O
have O
. O

With O
different O
languages O
we O
all O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

In O
substance O
, O
we O
are O
not O
far O
apart O
. O

The O
big O
problem O
is O
the O
so O
- O
called O
overthrow O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
foreseen O
by O
the O
Bicameral O
. O

And O
in O
all O
of O
this O
, O
Dellai B-PER
has O
probably O
made O
some O
error O
of O
judgment O
. O

If O
diplomatically O
he O
had O
moved O
in O
a O
different O
way O
, O
on O
December O
18 O
he O
would O
have O
been O
president O
in O
the O
provincial O
council O
. O

And O
even O
in O
dealing O
with O
the O
SVP B-ORG
they O
wanted O
to O
be O
ahead O
of O
the O
curve O
. O

I O
say O
this O
with O
extreme O
tranquility O
, O
without O
criticism O
. O

So O
you O
are O
building O
a O
new O
region B-LOC
? O

On O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
delegation O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
we O
realize O
that O
in O
the O
party O
we O
will O
have O
great O
problems O
in O
making O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
will O
not O
be O
the O
antechamber O
to O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
paradox O
: O

The O
Greens B-ORG
want O
you O
to O
be O
president O
of O
the O
region B-LOC
, O
the O
SVP B-ORG
does O
not O
.... O

The O
SVP B-ORG
has O
never O
really O
pronounced O
itself O
. O

Brugger B-PER
has O
only O
said O
: O
" O
Between O
the O
two O
quarrels O
we O
'll O
take O
it O
. O

But O
it O
was O
a O
joke O
. O

We O
have O
been O
accused O
of O
being O
the O
foolish O
servants O
of O
Svp B-ORG
, O
but O
when O
we O
go O
to O
negotiate O
on O
the O
Region B-LOC
, O
the O
Trentino O
people O
say O
to O
Svp B-ORG
: O
" O
you O
decide O
" O
. O

Is O
this O
the O
way O
to O
behave O
? O

The O
agreement O
on O
the O
presidency O
must O
be O
reached O
in O
Trento B-LOC
, O
even O
if O
we O
decide O
to O
leave O
it O
to O
Svp B-ORG
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
Brugger B-PER
's O
blessing O
, O
because O
then O
it O
would O
mean O
that O
we O
are O
on O
our O
knees O
, O
as O
I O
fear O
someone O
has O
done O
. O

The O
fact O
remains O
that O
the O
support O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
is O
strange O
. O

It O
's O
true O
, O
but O
on O
issues O
such O
as O
the O
guarantee O
I O
have O
always O
appreciated O
Boato B-PER
. O

On O
territorial O
issues O
we O
get O
along O
less O
well O
. O

But O
we O
wonder O
why O
the O
SVP B-ORG
wants O
to O
make O
homologous O
juntas O
and O
then O
does O
n't O
want O
them O
in O
the O
Bolzano B-LOC
junta O
. O

How O
can O
you O
have O
them O
in O
the O
majority O
in O
the O
Region B-LOC
and O
not O
in O
Bolzano B-LOC

And O
then O
why O
not O
open O
the O

to O

, O
less O

less O

, O
more O

excuse O

it O

I O
did O

Dear O
Director O
, O
only O
today O
, O
returning O
from O
a O
business O
trip O
, O
I O
can O
consider O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
tranquility O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
has O
seen O
me O
inadvertently O
starring O
in O
your O
newspaper O
. O

First O
, O
I O
must O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
recognize O
myself O
in O
the O
headline O
" O
Dellai O
eats O
museums O
" O
with O
which O
you O
wanted O
to O
present O
my O
intervention O
, O
putting O
a O
name O
at O
the O
top O
of O
an O
article O
in O
which O
, O
to O
keep O
the O
discussion O
on O
the O
plane O
of O
ideas O
and O
principles O
, O
I O
had O
very O
well O
taken O
care O
not O
to O
do O
. O

L O
' O
intervention O
itself O
was O
thus O
a O
kind O
of O
" O
stone O
" O
pre O
- O
election O
, O
according O
to O
a O
style O
that O
is O
still O
completely O
foreign O
to O
the O
intentions O
, O
interests O
and O
way O
of O
working O
of O
the O
writer O
. O

The O
same O
useless O
emphasis O
can O
be O
found O
in O
the O
six O
- O
column O
rebuttal O
of O
the O
following O
day O
( O
" O
The O

wants O

: O

Kezich B-PER
remains O
alone O
" O
) O
which O
leaves O
one O
completely O
dumbfounded O
: O

For O
its O
peremptory O
nature O
, O
certainly O
worthy O
of O
a O
better O
cause O
, O
and O
for O
the O
haste O
with O
which O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
close O
a O
civil O
debate O
that O
was O
more O
than O
legitimate O
and O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
useful O
, O
given O
the O
scarce O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
very O
scarce O
information O
circulated O
among O
the O
experts O
on O
this O
particular O
aspect O
of O
the O

project O

and O
to O
all O
others O
who O
may O
have O
misunderstood O

I O
reply O
that O
I O
have O
never O
written O
nor O
claimed O
that O
coordination O
among O

is O
unnecessary O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O

What O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
, O
however O
, O
is O
why O
the O

which O
already O
had O
all O
the O

at O
its O
disposal O
to O
direct O
and O
coordinate O
all O
of O
its O
cultural O
satellites O
, O
has O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
and O
in O
an O
obvious O
manner O
, O
increasingly O
refrained O
from O
doing O
so O
. O

Rather O
, O
it O
has O
preferred O
to O
postpone O
sine O
die O
the O
question O
of O
the O
museum O
network O
to O
a O
future O
institutional O
reconfiguration O
of O
the O
sector O
, O
of O
which O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
grasp O
either O
the O
urgency O
or O
the O
practical O
opportunity O
, O
and O
on O
which O
there O
are O

important O

How O

in O

I O
refer O
to O
the O
letter O
of O
Mrs. O
Francesca B-PER
Agnoli I-PER
, O
published O
on O
October O
8th O
, O
in O
which O
she O
complains O
about O
the O
danger O
of O
recognition O
of O
homosexual O
couples O
, O
especially O
if O
this O
preludes O
to O
the O
possible O
permission O
of O
adoption O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
recall O
that O
marriage O
, O
beyond O
the O
sacredness O
with O
which O
it O
has O
been O
clothed O
in O
the O
course O
of O
history O
, O
has O
been O
and O
remained O
essentially O
a O
contract O
. O

To O
be O
able O
to O
freely O
enter O
into O
a O
contract O
with O
legal O
value O
, O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
right O
of O
all O
. O

As O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
only O
a O
" O
traditional O
family O
is O
a O
suitable O
environment O
for O
a O
healthy O
and O
psychologically O
balanced O
growth O
" O
is O
just O
the O
usual O
stereotype O
. O

I O
invite O
the O
kind O
lady O
to O
read O
the O
reports O
of O
Telefono B-ORG
Azzurro I-ORG
, O
the O
data O
on O
domestic O
violence O
or O
even O
, O
simply O
, O
the O
daily O
news O
, O
which O
record O
, O
with O
impressive O
frequency O
, O
massacres O
within O
apparently O
healthy O
and O
balanced O
families O
. O

I O
am O
offended O
by O
the O
statements O
of O
the O
kind O
lady O
against O
all O
parents O
, O
both O
adoptive O
and O
become O
such O
with O
the O
' O
help O
of O
medicine O
, O
" O
believed O
to O
be O
free O
to O
order O
their O
children O
in O
a O
test O
tube O
, O
as O
is O
done O
with O
a O
pet O
dog O
, O
and O
then O
raise O
a O
child O
that O
is O
not O
theirs O
, O
who O
does O
not O
recognize O
in O
them O
a O
common O
genetic O
heritage O
... O
" O

The O
lady O
is O
then O
outraged O
at O
the O
idea O
that O
" O
it O
is O
legal O
for O
women O
, O
with O
an O
appropriate O
kit O
for O

and O
a O

best O
they O
were O
called O
girls O
- O
mothers O
, O
more O
often O
with O
infamous O
epithets O
. O

The O
novelty O
that O
the O
kind O
lady O
condemns O
, O
is O
the O
idea O
that O
women O
can O
deliberately O
choose O
to O
have O
a O
child O
" O
alone O
" O

But O
this O
is O
something O
that O
nature O
, O
whose O
laws O
the O
lady O
invokes O
, O
allows O
very O
well O
. O

I O
presume O
that O
the O
lady O
, O
writing O
that O
" O
nature O
clearly O
provides O
that O
man O
is O
born O
in O
a O
certain O
way O
, O
without O
manipulation O

artificial O
forces O
" O
meant O
instead O
to O
condemn O
all O
surgeries O
, O
transplants O
, O
artificial O
valves O
, O
transfusions O
, O
perhaps O
even O
medicines O
and O
so O
on O
, O
as O
manipulations O

artificial O
forces O
that O

The O
components O
of O
Azzurro B-ORG
Donna I-ORG
feel O
called O
to O
reflect O
on O
the O
request O
of O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Muslim O
community O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
for O
the O
introduction O
of O
an O
optional O
hour O
of O
Islamic O
culture O
and O
religion O
held O
by O
Arab O
teachers O
. O

In O
schools O
there O
is O
the O
hour O
of O
religion O
, O
whose O
attendance O
is O
not O
compulsory O
, O
by O
virtue O
of O
the O
Concordat O
between O
State O
and O
Church O
. O

Italy B-LOC
is O
a O
secular O
state O
, O
but O
the O
whole O
western O
culture O
is O
deeply O
marked O
by O
the O
common O
Christian O
matrix O
. O

For O
obvious O
historical O
reasons O
it O
is O
unthinkable O
to O
put O
the O
teaching O
of O
the O
Koran O
on O
the O
same O
level O
. O

Without O
bringing O
up O
ecumenism O
, O
we O
think O
that O
the O
Trentino O
society O
has O
already O
shown O
such O
a O
welcome O
, O
respect O
and O
openness O
to O
dialogue O
that O
it O
does O
not O
fear O
accusations O
of O
closure O
because O
of O
the O
perplexity O
aroused O
by O
Imam O
Breigheche B-PER
's O
request O
. O

And O
we O
do O
not O
like O
that O
the O
lack O
of O
reciprocity O
of O
treatment O
towards O
Christian O
communities O
in O
Islamic O
countries O
is O
simply O
posed O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
barter O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
much O
more O
complex O
. O

It O
is O
also O
a O
distortion O
to O
interpret O
this O
request O
of O
the O
Islamic O
community O
as O
a O
sign O
of O
openness O
or O
of O
willingness O
to O
integrate O
into O
the O
society O
that O
welcomes O
it O
. O

Imam O
Breigheche B-PER
is O
simply O
fulfilling O
his O
task O
, O
which O
is O
to O
conquer O
more O
and O
more O
space O
for O
his O
community O
. O

Full O
religious O
freedom O
and O
freedom O
of O
worship O
is O
out O
of O
the O
question O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
right O
to O
witness O
and O
pass O
on O
their O
faith O
to O
their O
children O
, O
but O
doing O
so O
in O
schools O
is O
another O
matter O
. O

Especially O
since O
we O
know O
that O
for O
Islam O
religious O
authority O
is O
often O
one O
with O
political O
and O
civil O
authority O
, O
unlike O
Christianity O
. O

This O
is O
the O
core O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

The O
Koran O
is O
the O
holy O
book O
of O
Islam O
, O
as O
such O
it O
deserves O
respect O
and O
consideration O
. O

But O
we O
also O
know O
that O
there O
are O
different O
possibilities O
of O
interpretation O
of O
this O
text O
. O

Without O
waving O
the O
bogeyman O
of O
the O
more O
fundamentalist O
ones O
that O
exalt O
the O
sacrifice O
of O
suicide O
bombers O
to O
kill O
in O
the O
name O
of O
holy O
war O
, O
it O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
sad O
and O
for O
us O
unacceptable O
realities O
such O
as O
stoning O
, O
infibulation O
, O
segregation O
and O
discrimination O
against O
women O
survive O
in O
Islamic O
countries O
. O

We O
can O
not O
ignore O
the O
deep O
conflict O
within O
Islam O
between O
the O
most O
fundamentalist O
souls O
and O
the O
moderate O
ones O
, O
but O
we O
certainly O
can O
not O
think O
of O
intervening O
or O
imposing O
the O
modalities O
of O
teaching O
and O
interpretation O
of O
the O
Koran O
. O

We O
testify O
to O
our O
values O
of O
freedom O
, O
respect O
for O
the O
person O
, O
tolerance O
and O
equality O
, O
we O
have O
left O
behind O
for O
centuries O
the O
Crusades O
and O
the O
Inquisition O
. O

The O
Islamic O
communities O
that O
are O
accepted O
in O
our O
society O
can O
find O
in O
the O
western O
world O
a O
precious O
opportunity O
to O
move O
away O
from O
fundamentalism O
and O
fundamentalism O
, O
if O
they O
wish O
. O

But O
how O
to O
live O
one O
's O
own O
faith O
remains O
a O
question O
that O
the O
Islamic O
world O
must O
face O
internally O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
and O
then O
through O
dialogue O
and O
confrontation O
externally O
, O
if O
it O
is O
willing O
to O
do O
so O
, O
with O
other O
faiths O
, O
with O
the O
Catholic O
world O
. O

But O
in O
no O
case O
and O
in O
no O
way O
at O
this O
moment O
can O
this O
responsibility O
be O
unloaded O
on O
our O
school O
system O
, O
which O
can O
not O
and O
must O
not O
become O
the O
interlocutor O
, O
neither O
the O
framework O
nor O
the O
intermediary O
to O
manage O
this O
very O
delicate O
issue O

Dear O
Director O
, O
I O
am O
the O
parent O
of O
a O
girl O
enrolled O
in O
the O
first O
year O
of O
high O
school O
and O
of O
a O
girl O
attending O
the O
first O
year O
of O
elementary O
school O
. O

In O
these O
days O
our O
children O
have O
returned O
" O
almost O
all O
" O
to O
school O
after O
the O
Easter O
vacations O
. O

I O
write O
" O
almost O
all O
" O
because O
even O
this O
year O
, O
and O
perhaps O
in O
particular O
this O
year O
, O
the O
calendar O
of O
Easter O
vacations O
has O
caused O
a O
real O
upheaval O
in O
Trentino O
families O
. O

I O
consider O
myself O
one O
of O
the O
lucky O
ones O
because O
the O
" O
vacations O
" O
of O
my O
two O
daughters O
were O
distributed O
over O
the O
same O
period O
. O

But O
unfortunately O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
for O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
Trentino O
families O
who O
, O
having O
two O
or O
more O
children O
enrolled O
in O
different O
schools O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
had O
to O
make O
do O
at O
the O
least O
worst O
, O
sometimes O
even O
doing O
so O
- O
called O
" O
somersaults O
" O
, O
asking O
for O
holidays O
and O
leaves O
to O
their O
own O
children O
. O
asking O
for O
vacations O
and O
permits O
from O
their O
employers O
and O
finding O
themselves O
forced O
to O
take O
periods O
of O
leave O
that O
they O
would O
have O
gladly O
enjoyed O
during O
the O
summer O
. O

This O
year O
the O
school O
calendar O
provides O
for O
the O
end O
of O
classes O
in O
the O
first O
days O
of O
June O
and O
the O
return O
in O
the O
second O
week O
of O
September O
. O

This O
long O
period O
forces O
families O
, O
in O
order O
to O
adequately O
follow O
their O
children O
, O
to O
break O
up O
vacations O
and O
permits O
, O
to O
rely O
on O
grandparents O
, O
uncles O
, O
relatives O
, O
babysitters O
, O
after O

school O
courses O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Specifically O
, O
I O
appeal O
to O
the O
Councillor O
for O
Education O
Tiziano B-PER
Salvaterra I-PER
and O
his O
staff O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
all O
political O
, O
social O
and O
trade O
union O
forces O
that O
are O
sensitive O
to O
this O
issue O
, O
so O
that O
we O
find O
a O
way O
through O
which O
we O
can O
build O
a O
single O
school O
calendar O
for O
all O
schools O
of O
order O
and O
degree O
of O
the O
Autonomous B-LOC
Province I-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
in O
order O
to O
facilitate O
both O
families O
and O
employers O
. O

I O
also O
appeal O
to O
the O
latter O
to O
take O
action O
, O
exerting O
the O
necessary O
pressure O
, O
because O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
division O
of O
the O
vacations O
and O
leaves O
of O
employees O
affects O
very O
strongly O
the O
" O
productivity O
" O
of O
their O
companies O
( O
both O

was O

in O
addition O
to O

great O
desire O

a O

is O

that O
the O

is O
present O
in O
a O

the O

but O
it O
is O
likely O
to O

only O

find O

in O
the O
constant O

of O
Mary B-PER

the O
first O
to O
recognize O

accept O
and O
support O
what O
Jesus B-PER

through O
in O
His O
Passion O

The O
suffering O
of O
the O
Mother O
is O
immense O
, O
but O
somehow O
manages O
not O
to O
make O
the O
viewer O
lose O
the O
connection O

The O
figure O
of O

the O

The O

among O

that O
it O

nothing O

they O

So O
an O

the O
headline O
of O
most O
Italian O
newspapers O

The O
evident O
intention O
is O
to O
make O

The O

But O
the O

itself O
to O
another O

more O
realistic O
meaning O
: O

Here O

how O
it O
happens O
to O
die O
an O
Italian O

A O
guy O

who O

What O
do O
you O
want O
to O
happen O

Hired O
by O
someone O
who O
had O
his O
commission O
on O
the O

by O
a O

who O

also O
with O
his O
good O
commission O

to O
protect O
someone O
who O
" O
works O
" O
in O
Iraq O
earning O
ten O
or O
a O
hundred O
times O

much O

In O

of O

he O
has O

his O

" O
Lives O

was O
the O
title O
of O

This O
would O
be O
the O
right O
title O
for O
this O

He O
knew O
the O

, O
he O

it O

freely O

Freely O
? O

Would O
he O
have O
accepted O
if O
he O
had O

a O

? O

No O
, O
killing O
a O

is O
infamous O
, O
as O
well O
as O
politically O
stupid O

But O
equally O
infamous O
is O
to O
create O
the O

not O
at O
all O
" O
exalted O
" O
to O
accept O
to O

their O

way O

Worse O
still O
is O
to O
make O

The O

crucial O

at O

it O

Yesterday O
the O

those O
of O

substantial O
increase O
in O
the O
possibility O
that O
RD B-ORG
run O
alone O
with O
Enzo B-PER

but O
certainly O
not O
to O
count O
and O
think O
of O
agreements O
for O
the O
second O
round O

" O
If O
Matteotti B-PER
does O
n't O
fit O

, O
he O
wo O
n't O

, O
" O
said O
Nino B-PER

yesterday O

It O
is O
possible O
, O
but O
also O
unlikely O
, O
that O
Matteotti B-PER

choice O
will O
divert O
Ds B-ORG
, O
Greens B-ORG

Democratic B-ORG

It O
would O
be O
difficult O

the O

but O
before O
shouting O

you O
have O
to O
listen O
to O
the O

verify O
one O

Otherwise O
it O
is O
a O
process O

the O
triumph O

Exactly O
what O
the O
Ulivists O
reproach O
( O
rightly O

to O

And O
then O
I O
confess O

I O
do O
not O
agree O

what O

First O
of O
all O

the O

not O
a O

they O
must O
correct O
what O

, O
but O
a O
way O
to O
deepen O

internalize O
the O
knowledge O
provided O
in O

in O
the O
little O

also O
the O

the O

In O
any O
activity O
it O
is O
only O
with O
constant O
commitment O

that O
good O

No O

the O

asked O
for O
hours O

In O

the O
tasks O
also O
serve O
to O
make O
children O
responsible O
for O
taking O
on O

completing O
a O
commitment O

It O
comes O
the O
legitimate O
suspicion O
that O
all O
these O
criticisms O
are O
due O
to O
the O
ever O
decreasing O
time O
that O

devote O

the O

of O
their O
children O

following O
them O

and O
the O
low O
consideration O
that O
many O
give O
to O

and O
the O
work O
of O
teachers O
, O
preferring O
TV O

as O
their O
convenient O
substitutes O

Often O
families O
do O
not O
find O
even O
five O
minutes O
to O
justify O
in O
writing O
, O
as O
good O
manners O

require O

the O
non O

performance O
of O

Considering O
that O
there O
are O
many O
teachers O
who O
devote O
themselves O
with O
passion O

a O

that O
the O
President O

it O

not O
a O

a O

I O
have O
a O
doubt O
: O

It O
is O
not O
that O
this O
increase O

in O

I O
think O
so O
because O
since O

2003 O
there O
is O
no O

the O

This O
means O
that O

for O

, O
received O
150 O

, O
until O
31.12.2002 O

a O

Now O
that O

, O
no O

that O

, O
will O
find O
himself O
in O

If O

" O

, O
claiming O

That O
this O
constitutes O

for O

the O

I O

the O

reflection O

caused O

it O

I O
therefore O
invite O

be O

more O

those O

allow O

Do O
not O
say O
, O
as O
' O
is O
also O
obvious O
that O
it O
is O
, O

the O
design O
of O

that O
led O

out O

the O

it O

with O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O

, O
the O
most O
important O
. O

The O
rumors O
circulating O
with O
insistence O
in O
the O
last O
few O
hours O
indicate O
Tanas B-PER
as O
an O
authoritative O
candidate O
, O
if O
not O
the O
most O
authoritative O
( O
at O
least O
under O
the O
political O
profile O
) O
, O
for O
one O
of O
the O
presidencies O
of O
the O
companies O
controlled O
by O
the O
City B-LOC
, O
a O
game O
that O
will O
inevitably O
open O
in O
the O
coming O
months O

anything O

in O

alone O

step O
back O

won O
his O

with O

Dellai B-PER

It O
's O
true O
, O
but O
we O
'll O
see O
later O
. O

Provided O
that O
in O
the O
meantime O
it O
has O
not O
vanished O
. O

The O
green O
Luigi B-PER
Marino I-PER
loses O
the O
environment O
and O
has O
to O
make O
do O
with O
school O
and O
personnel O
. O

And O
if O
the O
Ds B-ORG
will O
appeal O
to O
the O
Tar B-ORG
and O
should O
win O
because O
of O
the O
question O
of O
doubtful O
votes O
? O

Marino B-PER
can O
still O
remain O
in O
the O
council B-ORG
as O
an O
" O
outsider O
" O
. O
Theoretically O
, O
the O
post O
is O
assured O
, O
armored O
. O

" O
We O
will O
pose O
the O
possible O
problem O
at O
the O
appropriate O
time O
" O
glosses O
the O
mayor O
Molinari B-PER
. O

However O
, O
it O
will O
essentially O
be O
a O
problem O
of O
the O
subentrant O
in O
the O
council O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
councilwoman O
Morena B-PER
Galas I-PER
, O
first O
of O
the O
unelected O
after O

In O
the O
first O
council O
of O
the O
new O
legislature O
in O
program O
Wednesday O
afternoon O
( O
17 O
hours O
) O
the O
majority O
will O
also O
be O
presented O
with O
three O
proposals O
for O
three O
chairs O
of O
commissions O
. O

Patrick B-PER
Lorenzi I-PER
( O
Margherita B-ORG
) O
for O
the O
town O
planning O
, O
Giovanni B-PER
Santoni I-PER
( O
Italian B-ORG
Communists I-ORG
) O
for O
the O
social O
activities O
, O
Carlo B-PER
Daves I-PER
( O
Ds B-ORG
, O
in O
the O
moment O
in O
which O
it O
will O
have O
replaced O
Adalberto B-PER
Mosaner I-PER
) O
for O
the O
commission O
on O
the O
revision O
of O
the O
municipal O
Statute O
and O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
council O
room O
. O

The O
first O
consideration O
that O
comes O
naturally O
is O
that O
the O
commission O
on O
the O
companies O
is O
missing O
, O
wanted O
by O
the O
council B-ORG
during O
the O
legislature O
of O
Cesare B-PER
Malossini I-PER
and O
confirmed O
by O
the O
executive O
Matteotti O
. O

" O
The O
city B-ORG
council I-ORG
is O
sovereign O
- O
says O
Molinari B-PER
, O
who O
has O
claimed O
the O
specific O
competence O
- O
but O
personally O
I O
think O
more O
productive O
a O
constant O
circulation O
of O
information O
in O
the O
conference O
of O
group O
leaders O
. O

We O
do O
not O
put O
our O
hand O
on O
the O
fire O
but O
to O
think O
of O
a O
confirmation O
of O
the O
commission O
in O
question O
seems O
unrealistic O
. O

Here O
is O
the O
junta O
then O
, O
here O
is O
the O
government O
team O
that O
will O
guide O
the O
choices O
and O
the O
development O
of O
Riva B-LOC
in O
the O
next O
five O
years O
. O

Strongly O
anchored O
to O
the O
center O
, O
with O
a O
deputy O
mayor O
as O
Mosaner B-PER
( O
Ds B-ORG
) O
strong O
but O
apparently O
isolated O
. O

Trusted O
men O
, O
of O
few O
words O
, O
of O
very O
few O
externals O
, O
that O
before O
have O
not O
passed O
the O
scrutiny O
of O
their O
" O
general O
" O
. O

But O
from O
the O
birth O
and O
composition O
of O
this O
junta O
there O
also O
derives O
a O
political O
consideration O
that O
concerns O
above O
all O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
. O

Today O
, O
with O
Tanas B-PER
out O
of O
the O
executive O
and O
the O
former O
group O
leader O
Valandro B-PER
who O
has O
obtained O
only O
the O
confirmation O
of O
the O
delegation O
to O
youth O
policies O
, O
the O
socialist O
wing O
of O
the O
Rivana O
civic O
comes O
out O
objectively O
resized O
, O
almost O
frustrated O
in O
its O
aspirations O
. O

That O
' O
wing O
before O
and O
more O
than O
others O
has O
" O
broken O
" O
with O
the O
dissidents O
led O
by O
Peter B-PER
Matteotti I-PER
. O

Those O
dissidents O
, O
led O
by O
the O
same O
former O
deputy O
mayor O
, O
who O
have O
never O
hidden O
their O
desire O
for O
a O
" O
great O
center O
" O
and O
a O
return O
to O
a O
different O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
comforted O
by O
promises O
that O
someone O
must O
have O
made O
them O
. O

Today O
in O
this O
sense O
comes O
a O
contradictory O
signal O
. O

But O
today O
is O
today O

And O
tomorrow O
is O
another O
day O

No O

giardina I-PER

No O
indulgence O
, O
according O
to O
prosecutor O
Bruno B-PER
Giardina I-PER
Isabella B-PER
Agostini I-PER
deserves O
the O
maximum O
sentence O
. O

The O
magistrate O
who O
led O
the O
investigation O
into O
the O
crime O
of O
Terlago B-LOC
and O
then O
supported O
the O
prosecution O
in O
the O
courtroom O
, O
in O
his O
appeal O
has O
retraced O
step O
by O
step O
the O
' O
entire O
process O
and O
- O
in O
an O
act O
long O
70 O
pages O
- O
has O
highlighted O
all O
those O
who O
in O
his O
opinion O
were O
the O
contradictions O
in O
which O
the O
court O
fell O
. O

According O
to O
the O
' O
prosecution O
the O
sentence O
should O
have O
been O
much O
heavier O
because O
the O
judges O
should O
have O
recognized O
the O
prevalence O
of O
aggravating O
factors O
: O

cruelty O
, O
futile O
motives O
and O
above O
all O
premeditation O

heavy O
evidence O

notes O
the O
pm O
- O
the O
gup O
Carlo B-PER
Ancona I-PER
has O
recognized O
the O
premeditation O
of O
Cattoni B-PER
. O

" O
What O
seems O
to O
be O
able O
to O
perceive O
in O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
Court B-ORG
- O
we O
read O
in O
the O
' O
act O
of O

- O
is O
the O
desire O
, O
almost O
irrational O
as O
contrasting O
with O
the O

, O
to O
mentally O
eliminate O
all O
obstacles O
, O

resulting O
from O
the O
recognition O
of O

existence O
of O

. O

Giardina B-PER
also O
criticizes O
the O
trial O
attitude O
held O
by O
the O
defendant O
noting O
that O
Isabella B-PER
" O
has O
behaved O
falsely O
and O
reticently O
on O
numerous O
occasions O
" O
and O
, O
" O
after O
having O
told O
a O
lot O
of O

, O
when O
she O
decided O
to O

she O
did O
nothing O
but O
throw O
on O
Cattoni B-PER
all O
the O

. O

Finally O
, O
the O
process O
is O
repaired O
" O
behind O
the O
protective O
screen O
of O
spontaneous O
statements O
. O

In O
short O
, O
for O
the O
prosecutor O
, O
the O
defendant O
does O
not O
deserve O
any O
discount O
and O
for O
this O
reason O
the O
judges O
would O
have O
been O
wrong O
to O
grant O
general O
extenuating O

" O
The O

through O

cultural O
formation O
linked O
to O
the O
French O
painters O
of O
the O
Second O
Empire O

In O
the O
course O
of O
his O
long O
existence O
, O
he O
died O
at O
97 O
years O
old O
, O
he O
continued O
to O
deepen O
visions O
rooted O
in O
the O
culture O
of O
the O
late O
nineteenth O
century O
and O
always O
remained O
faithful O
to O
the O
poetics O
of O
reality O
, O
developed O
in O
his O
youth O
, O
without O
getting O
involved O
in O
the O
innovations O
of O
the O

He O
remains O
, O
apart O
from O

tied O
to O
the O
real O
and O
therefore O
lives O
in O
a O
century O
that O
" O
escapes O
him O
for O
philosophical O
and O
aesthetic O
premises O
. O

His O
landscapes O
represent O
for O
the O
most O
part O
scenes O
of O
country O
life O
always O
accompanied O
by O
an O
intense O
feeling O
for O
nature O
that O
becomes O
the O
spokesman O
of O
the O
incessant O
passing O
of O
time O
, O
of O
the O
daily O
succession O
of O
events O
. O

The O
most O
intense O
season O
in O
the O
activity O
of O
Fornara B-PER
goes O
from O
1891 O
to O
1897 O
, O
years O
of O
evolution O
that O
result O
in O
overcoming O
the O
canons O
assimilated O
by O
the O
lesson O
of O
Cavalli B-PER
and O
rethinking O
of O
the O
subjects O
; O

In O
fact O
, O
he O
passed O
from O
the O
portrait O
to O
the O
whole O
figure O
, O
from O
the O
still O
life O
, O
especially O
during O
his O
stay O
in O
Lyon B-LOC
, O
to O
genre O
scenes O
. O

He O
moved O
away O
from O
portraits O
and O
landscapes O
as O
an O
end O
in O
themselves O
and O
in O
a O
short O
time O
took O
possession O
of O
a O
brilliant O
palette O
and O
a O
pictorial O
space O
no O
longer O
unified O
, O
but O
made O
through O
flat O
backgrounds O
that O
block O
the O
movement O
of O
the O
figure O

He O
spends O
most O
of O
his O
years O
, O
except O
for O
the O
fortunate O
stops O
in O
Lyon O
and O
Paris O
at O
a O
very O
young O
age O
and O
then O
the O
participation O
in O
the O
most O
important O
national O
and O
international O
exhibitions O
, O
however O
, O
only O
until O
1922 O
, O
in O
the O
isolation O
of O
the O
Vigezzo B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
away O
from O
what O
he O
calls O
" O
the O
ephemeral O
fashions O
among O
which O
sways O
the O
' O
modern O
soul O
. O

Nature O
is O
the O
main O
source O
of O
inspiration O
, O
a O
nature O
that O
is O
not O
the O
heroic O
one O
depicted O
by O
Segantini B-PER
, O
whose O
lesson O
he O
assimilated O
without O
being O
a O
slave O
to O
his O
vision O
. O

The O
summer O
transhumances O
, O
such O
as O
Fontanalba B-LOC
of O
1904/1908 O
, O
which O
are O
meant O
to O
be O
a O
tribute O
to O
Segantini B-PER
, O
are O
large O
- O
scale O
works O
in O
which O
the O
acid O
colors O
often O
render O
the O
rarefied O
mountain O
light O
without O
being O
faithful O
to O
the O
real O
ones O
. O

There O
is O
no O
lack O
of O
allusive O
references O
to O
Segantini O
's O
concept O
of O
the O
sad O
hour O
, O
which O
is O
no O
longer O
twilight O
, O
but O
the O
great O
solitude O
of O
the O
mountain O
pasture O
, O
interrupted O
only O
by O
the O
mooing O
of O
the O
cow O
. O

Fornara B-PER
came O
into O
contact O
with O
Segantini I-PER
thanks O
to O
the O
intervention O
of O
Grubicy B-PER
who O
had O
him O
" O
hired O
" O
by O
Segantini B-PER
himself O
as O
an O
assistant O
for O
the O
Panorama O
of O
the O
Engadine O
which O
he O
was O
preparing O
for O
the O
Exposition O
Universelle O
. O

If O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
this O
represented O
a O
fortune O
for O
Fornara B-PER
, O
on O
the O
other O
it O
also O
created O
numerous O
misunderstandings O
for O
the O
development O
of O
his O
art O
; O

He O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
although O
rich O
in O
an O
academic O
training O
that O
Segantini B-PER
did O
not O
have O
and O
open O
to O
a O
modernist O
vision O
of O
French O
imprint O
, O
is O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
master O
in O
an O
unequal O
attitude O
, O
almost O
of O
psychological O
subjection O
. O

A O
difficult O
comparison O
for O
him O
that O
will O
turn O
from O
veneration O
into O
worship O
after O
the O
sudden O
and O
tragic O
death O
of O
Segantini B-PER
, O
less O
than O
a O
year O
after O
the O
beginning O
of O
their O
relationship O
. O

It O
will O
become O
even O
more O
difficult O
for O
him O
to O
detach O
himself O
from O
the O
message O
of O
his O
master O
, O
also O
because O
Alberto B-PER
Grubicy I-PER
will O
invest O
him O
with O
the O
role O
of O
" O
Segantini O
's O
heir O
of O
the O
poetry O
of O
the O
mountain O
" O
. O

But O
Fornara B-PER
's O
high O
mountain O
landscapes O
have O
" O
a O
sharpness O
and O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
calm O
serenity O
that O
is O
not O
found O
in O
Segantini B-PER
's O
work O
" O
. O

Pointillism O
is O
used O
to O
give O
the O
work O
a O
particular O
luminosity O
; O

His O
paintings O
are O
not O
places O
of O
the O
mind O
but O
places O
in O
which O
he O
has O
really O
lived O
since O
his O
childhood O

His O
paintings O
, O
then O
, O
are O
the O
transcription O
of O
environments O
loved O
and O
known O
forever O

He O
manages O
to O
transform O
a O
fragment O
of O

into O
a O
moment O
of O

into O
an O

Certainly O
when O
I O

in O

the O

of O

Council I-ORG
, O
Dellai B-PER
, O
looks O
with O
interest O
to O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
political O
picture O
and O
in O
particular O
to O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
Center O
and O
in O
the O
Patt B-ORG
my O
memory O
can O
not O
help O
but O
go O
to O
the O
last O
congress O
of O
the O
Ppi B-ORG
, O
held O
eighteen O
months O
ago O
. O

At O
that O
time O
I O
was O
defeated O
because O
I O
argued O
the O
need O
that O
the O
' O
current O
majority O
if O
he O
really O
wanted O
to O
pursue O
a O
policy O
of O
reform O
had O
to O
" O
recompose O
" O
with O
the O
center O
of O
Valduga B-PER
Giovanazzi B-PER
and O
Conci B-PER
and O
had O
to O
re O
- O
establish O
an O
' O
organic O
and O
strategic O
alliance O
with O
the O
Patt B-ORG
. O

I O
was O
accused O
directly O
, O
in O
a O
crude O
way O
, O
by O
Betta B-PER
, O
now O
a O
Senator O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
, O
and O
indirectly O
by O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
Dellai B-PER
, O
of O
being O
an O
advocate O
of O
the O
" O
reversal O
" O
comparing O
me O
to O
the O
worst O
figures O
in O
the O
political O
landscape O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
I O
was O
reproached O
for O
wanting O
to O
keep O
alive O
the O
Ppi B-ORG
instead O
of O
aiming O
at O
its O
liquidation O
to O
give O
life O
to O
Margherita B-ORG
. O

And O
now O
, O
in O
Rome B-LOC
, O
those O
who O
supported O
this O
thesis O
have O
" O
closed O
" O
with O
the O
national O
Margherita B-ORG
to O
give O
life O
to O
an O
autonomous O
group O
of O
some O
senators O
in O
the O
name O
of O
safeguarding O
the O
' O
autonomy O
. O

But O
the O
' O
autonomy O
are O
saved O
, O
if O
they O
believe O
it O
, O
the O
major O
parties O
and O
certainly O
not O
seven O
or O
eight O
senators O
. O

And O
on O
that O
occasion O
, O
finally O
, O
it O
was O
shouted O
to O
the O
four O
winds O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
junta B-ORG
would O
never O
be O
touched O
and O
that O
it O
would O
have O
brilliantly O
concluded O
the O
legislature O
. O

And O
yet O
it O
did O
not O
take O
much O
to O
understand O
that O
without O
a O
majority O
in O
the O
legislative O
commissions O
, O
without O
numbers O
in O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
and O
with O
a O
political O
climate O
between O
opposition O
and O
majority O
that O
suffers O
( O
in O
some O
respects O
understandably O
) O
from O
the O
violence O
suffered O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
legislature O
and O
without O
political O
forces O
capable O
of O
independently O
seeking O
a O
progressive O
recomposition O
, O
it O
became O
a O
chimera O
to O
think O
of O
a O
government O
capable O

does O
this O

Probably O
the O

a O

But O
whatever O

it O

If O

If O
you O
do O
not O
give O
back O
to O
the O
parties O
( O
and O
not O
to O
the O
exclusively O
personal O
movements O
) O
the O
task O
of O
redrawing O
a O
path O
for O
the O
future O
of O
this O
land O
, O
it O
will O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
give O
an O
answer O
to O
the O
current O
political O
crisis O
. O

The O
risk O
is O
that O
everything O
will O
be O
brought O
back O
to O
a O
question O
of O
numbers O
and O
then O
to O
a O
sort O
of O
" O
market O
" O
of O
counselors O
. O

And O
the O
even O
greater O
risk O
is O
that O
, O
making O
some O
play O
on O
words O
, O
the O
political O
crisis O
will O
be O
resolved O
simply O
by O
giving O
an O
answer O
on O
the O
level O
of O
numbers O
only O
. O

Nor O
can O
we O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
people O
and O
parties O
interested O
in O
this O
reshuffling O
, O
forget O
what O
has O
happened O
in O
recent O
years O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
there O
are O
some O
" O
titles O
" O
of O
arguments O
that O
should O
be O
further O
investigated O
. O

Who O
has O
worked O
for O
the O
destruction O
of O
the O
parties O
, O
who O
has O
preached O
the O
primacy O
of O
the O
new O
for O
the O
new O
, O
who O
considers O
the O
only O
repository O
of O
power O
( O
regardless O
of O
the O
process O
that O
determines O
it O
) O
the O
institutional O
figure O
, O
who O
has O
made O
the O
generational O
credo O
a O
political O
fact O
, O
who O
has O
interpreted O
, O
even O
on O
the O
level O
of O
power O
management O
, O
all O
this O
, O
can O
be O
the O
' O
future O
interpreter O
of O
a O
political O
phase O
that O
to O
be O
solid O
will O
be O
based O
on O
a O
re O
- O
legitimization O
of O
the O
role O
and O
function O
of O
the O
parties O
? O

And O
those O
political O
forces O
, O
above O
all O
of O
the O
Centre O
, O
that O
today O
are O
interested O
or O
are O
pushed O
or O
attracted O
by O
a O
government O
experience O
, O
do O
they O
weaken O
or O
strengthen O
the O
role O
they O
could O
have O
in O
the O
future O
? O

Is O
it O
more O
electorally O
useful O
, O
also O
considering O
the O
national O
wave O
, O
to O
be O
" O
homogenized O
" O
by O
the O
current O
leadership O
or O
could O
it O
be O
more O
useful O
to O
work O
on O
a O
provincial O
political O
structure O
that O
gives O
political O
forces O
their O
autonomy O
, O
their O
dignity O
within O
a O
coalition O
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
possibility O
to O
have O
a O
less O
conditioned O
role O
? O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
even O
here O
the O
legitimate O
personal O
ambitions O
come O
into O
play O
, O
but O
a O
party O
, O
slowly O
and O
with O
an O
ability O
to O
persuade O
, O
should O
prevail O
a O
design O
less O
tied O
to O
the O
contingent O
also O
because O
it O
does O
not O
necessarily O
represent O
a O
resource O
. O

It O
can O
be O
, O
instead O
, O
a O
problem O
. O

Then O
, O
on O
the O
table O
there O
is O
a O
broader O
discourse O
concerning O
the O
strategy O
, O
obviously O
combined O
with O
the O
contents O
, O
that O
the O
center O
- O
left O
will O
have O
to O
elaborate O
in O
order O
to O
repel O
the O
attack O
of O
the O
center O
- O
right O
. O

A O
question O
to O
which O
it O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
give O
an O
answer O
, O
but O
if O
a O
possibility O
of O
success O
exists O
, O
it O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
taking O
root O
of O
political O
forces O
, O
it O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
resumption O
of O
certain O
strands O
that O
have O
been O
" O
points O
of O
reference O
" O
for O
thousands O
of O
people O
and O
that O
someone O
has O
cut O
with O
too O
much O
superficiality O
and O
cynicism O
. O

Certainly O
in O
recent O
years O
the O
national O
and O
local O
political O
and O
institutional O
framework O
has O
undergone O
profound O
changes O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
that O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
this O
land O
have O
all O
emigrated O
to O
the O
Maldives B-LOC
and O
it O
is O
not O
even O
true O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
has O
suffered O
an O
' O
invasion O
or O
has O
been O
occupied O
by O
extraterrestrials O
who O
have O
imposed O
a O
new O
way O
of O
being O
and O
thinking O
. O

Now O
, O
after O
the O
storms O
of O
new O
ideas O
at O
all O
costs O
( O
but O
time O
should O
pass O
also O
for O
those O
who O
have O
made O
of O
new O
ideas O
an O
ideology O
! O
) O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
resume O
the O
difficult O
work O
of O
a O
resumption O
of O
political O
taste O
based O
on O
a O
just O
separation O
, O
which O
does O
not O
mean O
indifference O
, O
between O
political O
commitment O
in O
parties O
, O
movements O
and O
associations O
and O
political O
commitment O
in O

. O

It O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
remember O
that O
confusions O
are O
never O
useful O
to O
the O
consolidation O
of O
a O
laborious O
participatory O

, O
but O
are O
instead O
shortcuts O
behind O
which O
only O

everyone O

, O
if O
we O

carefully O

it O
is O
not O
the O

that O

the O

In O

A O

an O

If O

neither O

I O

that O
we O

in O
the O

of O

But O
I O
would O
like O
to O
deny O
strongly O
the O
repeated O
and O
unfounded O
accusation O
of O
" O
unacceptable O
and O
blatant O
injustices O
" O
of O
which O
teachers O
would O
be O
guilty O
: O

Just O
as O
I O
deny O
that O
their O
working O
hours O
are O
less O
than O
the O
hours O
of O
other O
workers O
, O
just O
because O
the O
' O
working O
time O
is O
distributed O
differently O
, O
as O
well O
as O
I O
reject O
all O
the O
' O
hateful O
resentment O
that O
continues O
to O
be O
expressed O
by O
many O
students O
( O
and O
often O
even O
parents O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
' O
public O
opinion O
) O
against O
the O
teaching O
class O
. O

In O
every O
context O
of O
human O
society O
there O
are O
honest O
people O
and O
dishonest O
people O
, O
committed O
workers O
, O
qualified O
and O
fair O
in O
the O
face O
of O
disengaged O
workers O
, O
inept O
and O
opportunists O
. O

In O
the O
delicate O
field O
of O
teaching O
, O
the O
imparting O
of O
the O
necessary O
knowledge O
should O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
educational O
function O
, O
which O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
" O
pandering O
" O
, O
but O
not O
even O
with O
the O
widespread O
permissiveness O
that O
is O
fashionable O
today O
. O

No O
one O
is O
infallible O
, O
some O
assessment O
may O
be O
wrong O
, O
some O
unworthy O
teacher O
may O
also O
commit O
favoritism O
( O
custom O
, O
however O
, O
very O
common O
in O
the O
world O
of O
politicians O
and O
business O
far O
more O
than O
in O
the O
world O
of O

) O
. O
: O

This O
does O
not O
justify O
the O
absurd O
and O
slanderous O
statements O
that O
students O
and O
families O
hurl O
with O
impunity O
and O
indiscriminately O
against O
the O
teaching O
class O
. O

Perhaps O
if O
in O
school O
was O
imposed O
a O
little O
' O
less O
laxity O
and O
a O
little O
' O
more O
d O
' O
commitment O
, O
if O
it O
were O
allowed O
a O
little O
less O
entertainment O

( O
from O
the O
' O
raging O
of O
the O
discos O
to O
the O
unrestrained O
use O
of O
media O
) O
and O
young O
people O
were O
stimulated O
to O
a O
more O
serious O
application O
, O
if O
they O
were O
invented O
a O
little O
' O
less O
' O
balefully O
innovative O
laws O
, O
if O
the O
TAR O
were O
a O
little O
' O
less O
indulgent O
and O
spread O
to O
all O
levels O
a O
little O
' O
more O
healthy O
balance O
, O
we O
would O
have O
less O
explosion O
of O
violence O
disguised O
as O
pseudo O
- O
ideals O
, O
less O
aggression O
and O
greater O
mutual O
respect O
. O

And O
perhaps O
this O
is O
the O
meaning O
of O

, O
having O
lived O
the O
problems O
of O

for O
fifteen O
years O
, O
to O
point O
out O
that O
the O
' O
existence O
of O
a O

with O
a O
capacity O
of O
175 O

spaces O
should O
be O
reflected O
before O

The O

of O

such O
as O

provincial O

postal O
and O
commercial O
offices O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
freeing O

areas O
on O

, O
requires O
a O
serious O
study O
of O
maintenance O
and O
development O
of O
this O
structure O
. O

It O
is O
also O
appropriate O
that O
a O
public O
or O
private O
service O
, O
which O
gives O
guarantees O
and O
comfort O
to O
those O
who O
want O
to O

the O

will O
undoubtedly O
be O

separations O
, O
which O
could O
be O
justified O
to O
overcome O
conflictual O
situations O
, O
risk O
becoming O
as O
many O
brakes O
on O
the O
progress O
of O
all O
. O

This O
is O
the O
moment O
to O
go O
beyond O
the O
phase O
of O
" O
separated O
at O
home O
" O
, O
beyond O
the O
simple O
" O
coexistence O
" O
. O
It O
is O
time O
to O
move O
beyond O
the O
" O
separate O
at O
home O
" O
phase O
, O
beyond O
mere O
" O
peaceful O
coexistence O
" O
between O
different O
linguistic O
groups O
in O
the O
same O
region O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
last O
reminder O
. O

Ciampi B-PER
has O
given O
his O
blessing O
to O
this O
new O
phase O
of O
autonomy O
, O
supported O
by O
the O
new O
Bolzano B-LOC
- O
Trento B-LOC
axis O
of O
Durnwalder B-PER
and O
Dellai B-PER
. O

But O
he O
wanted O
to O
give O
two O
warnings O
. O

The O
first O
is O
that O
of O
" O
not O
extending O
the O
staff O
of O
the O
public O
administrations O
too O
much O
" O
. O

Which O
is O
like O
saying O
: O

Careful O
not O
to O
multiply O
public O
spending O
unnecessarily O
, O
creating O
plethoric O
bureaucratic O
departments O
( O
temptation O
from O
which O
the O
two O
provinces O
and O
the O
region B-LOC
itself O
are O
not O
immune O
) O
. O

And O
the O
other O
warning O
is O
that O
the O
new O
phase O
of O
autonomy O
grants O
space O
to O
civil O
society O
. O

Which O
means O
, O
in O
Ciampi B-PER
's O
words O
, O
" O
space O
for O
the O
energies O
of O
the O
private O
sector O
, O
allowing O
it O
to O
perform O
functions O
which O
the O
public O
sector O
sometimes O
tends O
to O
appropriate O
, O
with O
the O
risk O
of O
slowing O
them O
down O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
an O
excess O
of O
regulations O
" O
. O

The O
authorization O
to O
the O
Third O
Statute O
project O
has O
come O
from O
Rome B-LOC
, O
from O
the O
highest O
Hill O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
up O
to O
the O
politics O
of O
Trentino O
and O
Alto O
Adige O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
the O
Head O
of O
State O
's O
deliveries O
. O

And O
now O
, O
after O
having O
definitively O
buried O
the O
old O
Region B-LOC
, O
there O
are O
no O
more O
alibis O
to O
build O
the O
new O
one O
. O

Immediately O
. O

Without O
other O
guilty O
delays O

Giovanni B-PER
Guzzetta I-PER
( O

who O
presented O
the O
question O
for O

on O

that O
the O
" O

" O
intend O

if O

for O

again O
in O
a O

of O
an O

To O
return O

the O

, O
without O
the O

, O
is O
the O
objective O
of O
the O

But O
there O
's O
a O
second O
major O
issue O
on O
which O
the O
Carbonari O
of O
the O
PD B-ORG
prepare O
a O
major O
mobilization O
: O

a O
strong O
proposal O
on O
' O
democratic O
order O
of O
the O
parties O
( O
of O
which O
they O
reported O
yesterday O
professors O
Alessandro B-PER
Mangia I-PER
and O
Cesare B-PER
Pinelli I-PER
) O
. O
Not O
only O
to O
fill O
the O
" O
hole O
" O
of O
the O
unspoken O
in O
' O
Article O
49 O
of O
the O
Constitution O
( O
" O
All O
citizens O
have O
the O
right O
to O
associate O
freely O
in O

to O
compete O
with O
democratic O
method O
to O
determine O
the O
national O
policy O
" O
) O
, O
but O
to O
finally O
give O
a O
breakthrough O
in O
the O
political O
system O
. O
but O
to O
finally O
give O
a O
turning O
point O
in O
a O
participatory O
sense O
to O
Italian O
politics O
. O

" O
There O
is O
a O
deficit O
of O
democracy O
in O
the O
parties O
- O
explains O
Kessler B-PER
- O
so O
we O
are O
thinking O
of O
a O
popular O
law O
initiative O
, O
not O
proposed O
only O
to O
the O
voters O
of O
the O
centre O
- O
left O
, O
which O
addresses O
the O
issue O
of O
transparent O
financing O
of O
the O
parties O
, O
which O
must O
agree O
to O
submit O
to O
standards O
of O
internal O
democracy O
, O
valid O
for O
all O
, O
starting O
from O
the O
choice O
of O
candidates O
through O
regulated O
primaries O
. O

The O
third O
area O
of O
commitment O
of O
the O
Association B-ORG
for I-ORG
the I-ORG
PD I-ORG
is O
obviously O
the O
path O
towards O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
. O

Yesterday O
in O
Sardagna B-LOC
they O
discussed O
how O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
process O
of O
comparison O
with O
the O
parties O
, O
Margherita B-ORG
and O
Ds B-ORG
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
starting O
with O
the O
appointment O

that O

The O

were O
also O
present O
yesterday O
, O
will O
meet O
again O
in O
September O
to O
establish O
a O
national O
organization O
. O

" O
The O
lukewarmness O
- O
to O
use O
a O
euphemism O
for O
Ds B-ORG
and O
Margherita B-ORG
- O
does O
not O
make O
us O
cold O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
spurs O
us O
to O
give O
ourselves O
a O
strong O
dimension O
, O
" O
explains O
Kessler B-PER
, O
who O
illustrates O
the O
ideal O
timetable O
: O

" O
Prodi B-PER
convenes O
parties O
and O
associations O
in O
October O
2006 O
, O
we O
present O
ourselves O

then O
we O
strengthen O
further O
at O
the O
national O
level O
, O
the O

their O
congresses O
in O
the O

of O

its O

in O
the O
constituent O
of O
the O

Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
without O
a O
network O
, O
with O
the O
vote O
of O
the O
members O
of O
the O
parties O
that O
will O
be O
worth O
as O
much O
as O
that O
of O
the O
new O
adherents O
to O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
who O
will O
sign O
a O
declaration O
of O
intent O

challenging O

He O
will O
win O
, O
among O
us O
, O
who O
will O
be O
able O

" O
It O
wo O
n't O
be O
easy O
- O
Kessler B-PER
replies O
- O
it O
wo O
n't O
happen O
spontaneously O
, O
but O
if O
we O
know O
how O
to O
mobilize O
ourselves O
, O
at O
the O
end O
the O
parties O
will O
understand O
that O
they O
will O
have O
to O
be O
there O
if O
they O
want O
to O
be O
followed O
by O
the O
base O
