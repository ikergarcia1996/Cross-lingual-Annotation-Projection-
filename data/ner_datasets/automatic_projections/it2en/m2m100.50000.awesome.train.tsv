In O
Trentino B-LOC
we O
are O
talking O
about O
the O
creation O

Is O
this O
the O
area O
we O
should O
invest O

“ O

Certainly O
Trento B-LOC
can O
not O
miss O
the O
opportunity O

invest O

as O

This O
applies O
to O
both O
the O

there O
is O

Yes O

In O
the O
start O
of O
the O
season O
on O
Sunday O
against O
the O
Ferrari O
team O
, O
in O
which O
the O
Arco B-ORG
failed O
to O
go O
beyond O
a O
domestic O
draw O
with O
untouched O
networks O
, O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
captain O
and O
the O
charismatic O
leader O
of O
the O
group O
Giulio B-PER
Andreoli I-PER
was O
felt O
. O

The O
key O
element O
of O
the O
arcense O
game O
( O
great O
experience O
in O
D B-ORG
for O
having O
played O
in O
the O
Benacense B-ORG
, O
in O
the O
Rovereto B-ORG
, O
in O
the O
Arzignano B-ORG
, O
in O
the O
Bassano B-ORG
and O
in O
the O
S. B-ORG
Donà I-ORG
) O
had O
to O
settle O
in O
the O
bench O
for O
a O
problem O
to O
the O
adapter O
suffered O
the O
week O
before O
and O
that O
does O
not O
allow O
him O
to O
be O
at O
100 O
% O
. O

But O
the O
captain O
is O
confident O
: O

“ O
As O
for O
my O
physical O
condition O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
feel O
that O
I O
’m O
out O
of O
balance O
. O

We O
hope O
that O
the O
problem O
does O
not O
evolve O
into O
a O
tendinopathy O
, O
otherwise O
the O
recovery O
times O
would O
be O
longer O
; O

For O
now O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
I O
will O
do O
everything O
to O
be O
on O
the O
field O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
as O
early O
as O
next O
Sunday O
, O
when O
we O
will O
be O
on O
stage O
in O
Salò B-LOC
, O
a O
transfer O
that O
deserves O
all O
our O
attention O
. O

When O
we O
look O
at O
yesterday O
’s O
match O
, O
I O
think O
we O
paid O
a O
high O
price O
for O
the O
excitement O
of O
the O
start O
in O
front O
of O
our O
audience O
. O

We O
kept O
very O
hard O
to O
do O
well O
and O
start O
with O
the O
right O
foot O
, O
but O
we O
must O
not O
forget O
that O
for O
many O
of O
my O
comrades O
it O
was O
the O
absolute O
first O
time O
in O
this O
series O
. O

I O
think O
we O
played O
a O
good O
game O
, O
putting O
in O
the O
field O
all O
the O
intensity O
we O
could O
. O

In O
the O
very O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
meeting O
we O
were O
not O
brilliant O
, O
I O
admit O
, O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
first O
half O
we O
tried O
to O
do O
the O
game O
and O
to O
impose O
our O
game O
and O
I O
also O
believe O
that O
for O
the O
long O
term O
, O
we O
did O
quite O
well O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
. O

In O
the O
second O
half O
, O
the O
heat O
became O
the O
main O
protagonist O
. O

Certainly O
we O
suffered O
more O
than O
they O
, O
but O
probably O
this O
is O
also O
due O
to O
the O
physical O
structure O
: O

They O
are O
a O
lot O
faster O
and O
faster O
players O
than O
us O
. O

Now O
we O
have O
the O
whole O
week O
ahead O
to O
work O
and O
prepare O
for O
the O
next O
game O
, O
correcting O
the O
mistakes O
made O
, O
but O
starting O
from O
how O
good O
it O
was O
. O

I O
hope O
to O
be O
back O
at O
the O
disposal O
of O
the O
gentleman O
and O
I O
am O
confident O
, O
especially O
in O
light O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
next O
week O
, O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
have O
a O
better O
basic O
physical O
condition O
than O
that O

that O
the O
five O

“ O
This O

a O

we O

the O

the O

there O

the O

A O
first O
outcome O
of O
this O

could O
be O
“ O

zero O

which O
( O

“ O

synthesizes O
a O
way O
to O
say O
that O
minorities O
exist O
and O
do O
not O
exist O

since O
we O
are O
all O
a O

The O
concept O
of O
“ O
universal O
mixing O
” O
by O

winner O
Derek B-PER
Walcott I-PER
explains O
that O
worldwide O
the O
mixing O
of O
languages O

peoples O
and O
cultures O
is O
now O
an O
indispensable O
fact O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
every O
minority O
contains O
a O
treasure O
of O
knowledge O
and O
identity O
, O
which O
, O
like O
all O
treasures O
, O
has O
value O
only O
if O
shown O
and O
exchanged O
. O
” O

But O
another O
meaning O
intends O
to O
recall O
the O
great O
tradition O
of O
the O
“ O

” O
of O
Spanish O
literature O

change O

The O
Crac O

The O
building O
entrepreneur O
feels O
deceived O
by O
the O
Parma B-LOC
merchant O
who O
had O
to O
save O
his O
company O

China B-PER
accuses O
Signifredi B-PER
of O
fraud O

The O
buyer O
of O
the O
company O
did O
not O
even O
pay O
the O
thousand O
euros O
agreed O

The O
company O
was O
declared O
bankrupt O
after O
the O
arrest O
of O
the O
merchant O
. O

The O
Chinese B-PER
feel O
deceived O
by O
Paolo B-PER
Signifredi I-PER
. O

This O
is O
why O
the O
construction O
entrepreneur O
filed O
a O
complaint O
against O
the O
Parma B-LOC
merchant O
who O
had O
bought O
China B-ORG
Construction I-ORG
for O
a O
thousand O
euros O
, O
money O
that O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
Signifredi B-PER
never O
paid O
. O

A O
few O
days O
after O
the O
purchase O
of O
China B-ORG
, O
Signifredi O
was O
arrested O
by O
the O
Finance O
Guard O
for O
having O
to O
pay O
a O
three O
- O
year O
sentence O
for O
receiving O
and O
recycling O
a O
car O
. O

The O
arrest O
of O
Signifredi B-PER
precipitated O
things O
and O
within O
a O
few O
days O
the O
court B-ORG
of I-ORG
Trento I-ORG
declared O
the O
failure O
of O
China B-ORG
. O

A O
month O
later O
, O
the O
Prosecutor B-ORG
’s I-ORG
Office I-ORG
requested O
the O
arrest O
of O
Chini B-PER
and O
his O
son O
Gianluca B-PER
, O
who O
were O
investigated O
for O
fraudulent O
bankruptcy O
. O

Then O
China B-PER
decided O
to O
denounce O
Signifredi B-PER
. O

The O
merchant O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
the O
white O
knight O
called O
to O
save O
China B-ORG
, O
and O
instead O
he O
was O
the O
one O
who O
drowned O
it O
. O

But O
the O
fraud O
complaint O
is O
probably O
linked O
to O
a O
series O
of O
agreements O
the O
two O
entrepreneurs O
had O
made O
. O

Chini B-PER
blames O
Signifredi B-PER
for O
not O
keeping O
his O
commitments O
, O
for O
deceiving O
him O
about O
the O
seriousness O
of O
his O
intentions O
. O

China B-PER
, O
in O
fact O
, O
has O
always O
argued O
that O
the O
company O
could O
safely O
avoid O
bankruptcy O
, O
since O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
the O
licenses O
of O
five O
shopping O
centers O
that O
China B-ORG
had O
in O
mind O
to O
build O
in O
the O
Northeast O
would O
have O
arrived O
. O

These O
were O
deals O
that O
would O
definitively O
heal O
China B-ORG
’s O
treasures O
. O

Businesses O
that O
could O
not O
be O
completed O
due O
to O
failure O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
the O
curator O
who O
tries O
to O
pull O
the O
money O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
income O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
much O
lower O
than O
a O
normal O
management O
. O

Chini B-PER
had O
left O
the O
task O
of O
managing O
these O
affairs O
to O
Signifredi B-PER
, O
who O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
creditors O
and O
then O
hand O
over O
the O
company O
to O
a O
construction O
entrepreneur O
in O
Grosseto B-LOC
, O
Galeardi B-PER
. O

However O
, O
the O
arrest O
of O
the O
dealer O
caused O
everything O
to O
collapse O
. O

That O
is O
why O
China B-PER
felt O
deceived O
and O
decided O
to O
file O
a O
complaint O
. O

The O
entrepreneur O
feels O
the O
victim O
of O
a O
rage O
because O
in O
his O
view O
Signifredi B-PER
had O
all O
the O
means O
available O
to O
save O
the O
company O
. O

This O
would O
, O
of O
course O
, O
also O
safeguard O
the O
position O
of O
the O
same O
Chini B-PER
who O
subsequently O
ended O
up O
in O
house O
arrest O
and O
now O
is O
still O
investigated O
along O
with O
his O
son O
with O
the O
accusation O
of O
fraudulent O
bankruptcy O
. O

Chini B-PER
is O
even O
at O
risk O
of O
losing O
the O
house O
, O
as O
it O
is O
headed O
to O
her O
former O
company O
and O
could O
now O
be O
auctioned O
by O
the O
curator O
. O

. O

Trentini B-PER
, O
defended O
by O
lawyer O
Mario B-PER
Murgo I-PER
, O
so O
he O
was O
able O
to O
leave O
the O
prison O
of O
Vicenza B-LOC
to O
return O
to O
house O
arrest O
, O
while O
Spanish B-PER
is O
still O
in O
prison O
in O
Tolmezzo B-LOC
, O
accused O
of O
other O
crimes O
. O

The O
two O
are O
accused O
by O
the O
carabiniers B-ORG
of O
having O
participated O
in O
the O
coup O
along O
with O
Walter B-PER
Zanetti I-PER
and O
Paul B-PER
John I-PER
Pallaoro I-PER
. O

According O
to O
the O
Prosecutor B-ORG
’s I-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
the O
two O
had O
only O
organized O
the O
coup O
, O
which O
was O
then O
executed O
by O
the O
two O
accomplices O
, O
who O
were O
recognized O
by O
two O
people O
. O

The O
organizational O
conduct O
would O
have O
taken O
place O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
places O
by O
the O
Trentini B-PER
who O
had O
carried O
out O
restructuring O
work O
there O
. O

Witnesses O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
claimed O
that O
the O
two O
robbers O
were O
moving O
inside O
their O
home O
with O
perfect O
knowledge O
of O
the O
places O
, O
so O
that O
they O
knew O
where O
the O
safe O
was O
located O
. O

According O
to O
investigators O
Trentini B-PER
would O
have O
provided O
Spanish B-PER
with O
the O
information O
to O
complete O
the O
coup O
, O
but O
according O
to O
the O
review B-ORG
court I-ORG
judges O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
this O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
judges O
note O
that O
Trentini B-PER
remained O
in O
prison O
from O
1999 O
to O
2003 O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
may O
not O
have O
participated O
in O
the O
restructuring O
work O
at O
the O
Dusevich B-PER
house O
recently O
. O

He O
himself O
told O
the O
gip O
that O
he O
had O
done O
those O
work O
in O
1992 O
. O

Given O
the O
time O
passed O
, O
the O
judges O
doubt O
that O
Trentini B-PER
may O
be O
the O
source O
of O
information O
so O
detailed O
that O
the O
robbers O
can O
move O
perfectly O
comfortably O
in O
Dusevich B-PER
’s O
home O
. O

It O

the O

it O

from O

can O

that O

Passardi B-PER
tries O
to O
solve O
at O
the O
root O
the O
main O
problem O
, O
that O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
biotope O
of O
the O
Laghetti B-LOC
in O
the O
nearest O
part O
of O
the O
rocky O
wall O
. O

In O
order O
not O
to O
affect O
such O
a O
delicate O
environment O
he O
launches O
the O
idea O
of O
moving O
the O
road O
, O
which O
now O
passes O
side O
by O
side O
, O
realizing O
it O
ex O
novo O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
plain O
, O
along O
the O
argine O
of O
the O
Adige B-LOC
River O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
all O
traffic O
, O
consisting O
of O
the O
trash O
- O
loaded O
trucks O
that O
run O
the O
way O
with O
the O
landfill O
of O
Ischia B-LOC
Podetti I-LOC
but O
in O
the O
future O
also O
from O
the O
means O
directed O
to O
the O
companies O
of O
the O
dirt O
pole O
, O
would O
be O
distant O
from O
the O
biotope O
and O
the O
access O
system O
to O
the O
various O
companies O
could O
be O
organized O
rationally O
along O
the O
river O
. O

This O
will O
also O
allow O
to O
transform O
the O
current O
road O
into O
a O
cycling O
track O
that O
would O
make O
the O
area O
of O
the O
biotope O
and O
the O
rock O
gym O
more O
enjoyable O
. O

But O
the O
delicate O
environmental O
balance O
of O
the O
Laghetti B-LOC
will O
still O
be O
at O
risk O
if O
other O
precautions O
are O
not O
taken O
. O

Because O
beyond O
the O
wetlands O
the O
biotope O
is O
a O
delicate O
habitat O
, O
frequented O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
by O
some O
species O
of O
rapaceous O
birds O
. O

Therefore O
, O
you O
must O
also O
be O
very O
careful O
about O
the O
noise O
impact O
of O
work O
activities O
and O
light O
pollution O
at O
night O
. O

This O
is O
why O
the O
work O
will O
have O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
it O
does O
not O
cause O
disturbance O
, O
therefore O
essentially O
inside O
the O
huts O
, O
and O
the O
external O
lighting O
will O
have O
to O
be O
subject O
to O
limits O
and O
controls O
. O

One O
of O
the O
problems O
repeatedly O
and O
that O
concern O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
Vela B-LOC
is O
the O
height O
of O
the O
waist O
, O
placed O
practically O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
countryside O
plane O
. O

In O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
work O
, O
the O
area O
will O
inevitably O
need O
to O
be O
recharged O
with O
substantial O
ground O
replacements O
. O

But O
this O
is O

the O

" O
According O
to O
us O
- O
said O

the O

The O

according O

by O
the O

the O

the O

, O
the O

Yesterday O
it O

the O
president O
of O
the O
European B-ORG
Central I-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
Jean O
- O
Claude B-PER
Trichet I-PER
, O
who O
summed O
up O
the O
concerns O
of O
European O
central O
bankers O
, O
pointing O
out O
that O
“ O
the O
high O
prices O
reached O
by O
oil O
had O
a O
visible O
direct O
impact O
” O
on O
inflation O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
according O
to O
Trichet B-PER
, O
the O
effects O
on O
the O
dynamics O
of O
consumer O
prices O
have O
already O
been O
seen O
, O
which O
will O
hardly O
be O
able O
to O
fall O
below O
2 O
% O
in O
the O
Eurozone O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year O
. O

The O
biggest O
concern O
, O
however O
, O
concerns O
the O
possibility O
that O
indirect O
effects O
, O
which O
so O
far O
have O
not O
been O
experienced O
or O
have O
been O
contained O
, O
may O
be O
manifested O

In O

these O
are O
the O
unhappy O
consequences O

the O

always O
there O

your O
true O
initiation O

But O
you O
are O

professional O
football O
idols O
sometimes O
become O
figures O
to O
love O
and O
imitate O
other O
monsters O

they O
represent O
what O
you O

be O

if O
you O

summer O
you O
rest O

your O
thought O

there O

when O
you O
start O
the O
preparation O
, O
every O
opportunity O
is O
good O
to O
remind O
you O
that O
you O
are O
also O
a O
footballer O
and O
when O
you O
meet O
with O
friends O
, O
you O
do O
nothing O
but O
remember O
the O
anecdotes O
, O
victories O
and O
defeats O
, O
how O
that O
footballer O
who O
was O
supposed O
to O
start O
had O
forgotten O
his O

one O
morning O
you O

up O

you O
realize O
that O
this O

a O
dream O

life O

a O
switch O

turns O
off O

it O

your O
life O
itself O

Everything O
assumes O
a O
clearer O
meaning O
and O
you O
can O
live O
your O
favorite O
sport O
with O
serenity O

because O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
has O
always O
characterized O
your O
desire O

train O

the O
disappointment O
for O

the O
joy O
for O

over O
the O
years O
, O
the O
endless O
journeys O
to O
reach O
the O
fields O
of O

province B-LOC
, O
can O
be O
summarized O
in O
the O
inception O
of O
a O
poem O
by O
Pedro B-PER
Salinas I-PER
, O
Madridist O
poet O
of O
the O
last O
century O
: O
" O
Do O
n't O
reject O
dreams O

they O
are O
dreams O

All O
dreams O
can O
come O
true O

the O
dream O
does O
not O
end O

“ O
You O
, O
amateur O
footballer O
, O
are O
not O
a O
professional O
, O
your O
earnings O
in O
proportion O
, O
are O
nothing O

However O
, O
you O
can O
say O
with O
certainty O
that O
you O
are O
not O
a O
worse O
man O
, O
and O
maybe O
your O
passion O
is O
more O
pure O
, O
because O
every O
time O
you O
wear O
the O
shoes O
and O
a O
shirt O
, O
you O
enter O
the O
field O
, O
run O
and O
eventually O
you O
are O
exhausted O
, O
but O
you O
come O
back O
child O

happy O
with O
a O
primordial O
emotion O

and O
of O
this O
you O
will O
never O

“ O
When O

The O

In O
addition O

by O

on O

“ O
The O

It O
would O
essentially O
be O
to O
introduce O

“ O
a O

not O

, O
the O
deputy O

stressed O
. O

To O
get O
to O
this O

Tortoli B-PER
highlighted O
the O
need O
for O

“ O

the O

” O
said O
the O
head O
of O

Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
at O
the O
meeting O
convened O
at O
the O
Mart O
of O

After O
stressing O
that O
the O

can O
be O
read O
as O
proof O
of O
the O
importance O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
gives O
to O
culture O
, O
Cogo B-PER
admitted O
that O
the O
figure O
may O
also O
be O
indicative O
of O
a O
" O
expensive O
management O
" O
. O

“ O
It O
is O
undoubted O
that O
we O
should O
develop O
economies O
of O
scale O
, O
” O
he O
then O
frankly O
admitted O
, O
addressing O
the O
advisors O
, O
cultural O
leaders O
, O
and O
directors O
of O
museums O
who O
crowded O
the O
Library O
of O
the O
Historical O
Archive O
of O
the O
900s O
where O
the O
first O
of O
the O
meetings O
promoted O
to O
try O
to O
make O
the O
museum O
system O
of O
the O
Euroregion B-LOC
Trentino I-LOC
Alto I-LOC
Adige I-LOC
- O
Tirol O
a O
single O
network O
. O

In O
many O
European O
countries O
, O
the O
tendency O
to O
entrust O
museums O
with O
tasks O
that O
go O
beyond O
the O
mere O
conservation O
of O
collections O
has O
been O
consolidated O
, O
to O
embrace O
the O
wider O
field O
of O
promotion O
of O
cultural O
events O
. O

And O
this O
requires O
territorial O
coordination O
and O
new O
management O
logic O
, O
system O
logic O
. O

From O
this O
awareness O
arises O
the O
meeting O
that O
the O
three O
cultural O
leaders O
on O
the O
Rovereto B-LOC
- O
Innsbruck B-LOC
axis O
have O
thought O
to O
organize O
to O
study O
forms O
of O
collaboration O
. O

It O
should O
be O
said O
immediately O
that O
both O
the O
Zanon B-PER
and O
the O
Kasslatter B-PER
Mur I-PER
, O
respectively O
for O
Tyrol B-LOC
and O
South B-LOC
Tyrol I-LOC
, O
look O
very O
closely O
at O
the O
prospect O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
Bolzano B-LOC
wants O
, O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
to O
create O
a O
Munich B-LOC
- O
Verona B-LOC

, O
one O
of O

are O
not O

As O
for O
the O
staff O
, O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
made O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
problem O
, O
not O
secondary O
, O
is O
in O
some O
ways O
ethical O
. O

“ O
We O

also O

It B-PER

not O
the O

but O
it O
’s O
not O
the O
case O

You O
- O
lines O
- O
are O
to O
say O
that O
this O
time O
is O
fine O
, O
that O
you O
can O
go O
ahead O
. O

Here O
is O
the O
statement O
released O
last O
night O
after O
a O
brief O
meeting O
: O

“ O
The O
executive O
of O
the O
Trentino B-LOC
Ds O
takes O
note O
positively O
of O
the O
new O
method O
of O

with O
which O
the O
centre O
- O
left O
autonomous O
coalition O
resumed O
its O
activity O
after O
the O
summer O
break O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
the O
Ds B-ORG
executive O
takes O
note O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
coalition O
will O
meet O
in O
the O
coming O
days O
to O
discuss O
and O
deepen O
issues O
related O
to O

, O

and O
energy O
. O
” O

In O
other O
words O
, O
go O
ahead O
like O
this O
. O

It O
is O
unfortunate O
that O
this O
brief O
announcement O
follows O
a O
few O
hours O
after O
the O
publication O
of O
an O
interview O
with O
a O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
never O
so O
angry O
. O

Yes O
, O
with O
so O
many O
warrior O
statements O
for O
the O
observance O
of O
the O
programmes O
and O
in O
defense O
of O
the O
“ O
idea O
” O
that O
has O
the O
left O
of O
institutional O
reform O
. O

The O
Democrats B-ORG
of I-ORG
the O
Left O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
are O
always O
able O
to O
surprise O
: O

As O
soon O
as O
you O
create O
a O
“ O
photography O
” O
of O
the O
Carver B-ORG
, O
this O
dissolves O
. O

You O
think O
you O
have O
placed O
all O
the O
names O
in O
the O
different O
categories O
and O
– O
in O
a O
battlefield O
– O
the O
castle O
jumps O
in O
the O
air O
. O

Really O
an O
endless O
rebus O
. O

But O
was O
it O
not O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
that O
“ O
Follini B-PER
de O
noantri O
” O
that O
called O
for O
the O
observance O
of O
programmes O
and O
advanced O
criticisms O
on O
institutional O
reform O
and O
the O
research O
reorganization O
plan O
? O

It O
is O
now O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
. O

And O
was O
it O
not O
this O
latter O
who O
led O
the O
party O
of O
the O
governmental O
filaments O
, O
of O
the O
president O
’s O
most O
loyal O
members O
, O
willing O
to O
bend O
their O
head O
in O
order O
not O
to O
give O
up O
their O
velveted O
chairs O
? O

No O
, O
nothing O
is O
true O
. O

Now O
we O
are O
still O
waiting O
for O
new O
categories O
, O
new O
positions O
, O
additional O
wires O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
Congress O
of O
the O
Quercia B-ORG
conditioned O
somewhat O
the O
Trentino O
politics O
, O
although O
Mr. O
Gigi B-PER
Olivieri I-PER
is O
right O
when O
he O
says O
that O
all O
in O
all O
“ O
we O
are O
a O
circle O
of O
a O
thousand O
members O
, O
and O
for O
this O
we O
must O
look O
beyond O
the O
party O
” O
. O

Yes O
, O
because O
many O
of O
the O
interventions O
of O
these O
days O
can O
be O
read O
as O
“ O
adjustments O
” O
in O
view O
of O
the O
renewal O
of O
the O
secretariat O
: O

If O
the O
Cogo B-PER
takes O
a O
position O
against O
Dellai B-PER
, O
it O
is O
evident O
its O
concern O
to O
occupy O
the O
space O
of O
those O
who O
believe O
that O
the O
left O
is O
too O
flat O
on O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
space O
now O
occupied O
by O
Andreolli B-PER
and O
Chiodi B-PER
. O

The O
most O
ironic O
these O
days O
seems O
to O
be O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
, O
who O
is O
getting O
some O
recognition O
: O

“ O
When O
I O
said O
the O
things O
that O
Cogo B-PER
now O
supports O
, O
I O
passed O
on O
to O
what O
wants O
to O
break O
everything O
apart O
. O

and O
patience O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
I O
’m O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
fact B-PER
that O
I O
’m O
not O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
anything O
. O

Right O
now O
that O
I O
am O
leaving O
, O
I O
almost O
get O
to O
think O
of O
another O
mandate O
. O
” O

For O
Congress O
, O
the O
games O
are O
not O
done O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
candidacy O
of O
Andreolli B-PER
and O
Wanda B-PER
Chiodi I-PER
, O
some O
items O
refer O
to O
the O
appointment O
of O
a O
“ O
garantor O
” O
to O
the O
role O
of O

to O
unite O

It O
is O
not O
a O

that O
the O

For O
these O
reasons O

the O

leave O

will O
have O
to O
see O
it O
with O
his O
friends O
Ricardo B-PER

but O
also O
because O

a O

Dellai B-PER

But O
it O

not O
enough O

: O

It O
is O
the O

Because O

In O
fact O
, O
President O

, O
in O
short O
, O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
welcomed O
you O
only O
half O
of O
the O
four O
requests O
you O
submitted O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
there O
was O
commitment O
by O
the O
government O
on O
only O
half O
of O
the O
first O
issue O
. O

Nothing O
about O
the O
other O
three O
. O

The O
Minister O
has O
repeated O
several O
times O
that O
he O
is O
not O
far O
from O
our O
approach O
, O
but O
then O
added O
: O

We O
need O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
at O
the O
political O
summit O
of O
the O
majority O
. O
” O

Something O
you O
brought O
home O
. O

“ O
Yes O
, O
there O
is O
the O
government O
’s O
commitment O
that O
institutional O
changes O
only O
come O
into O
effect O
if O
they O
involve O
more O
autonomy O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
though O
. O

It O
is O
all O
in O
the O
national O
interest O
. O

If O
the O
government O
rejects O
that O
a O
provincial O
law O
hurts O
this O
interest O
, O
it O
no O
longer O
sends O
it O
to O
the O
Court B-ORG
, O
but O
to O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
which O
is O
a O
political O
body O

and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
can O
cancel O
it O
. O

This O
is O
clearly O
unacceptable O
for O
us O
. O
” O

It O
is O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
is O
in O
Italy B-LOC

“ O
The O
concept O
of O
national O
interest O
is O
dangerous O
, O
because O
it O
is O
not O
defined O
. O

It O
is O
so O
vague O
that O
, O
of O
course O
, O
being O
at O
the O
discretion O
of O
political O
bodies O
, O
it O
lends O
itself O
to O
possible O
coercion O

Even O
more O
serious O
is O
then O
the O
possibility O
that O
Parliament B-ORG
deliberates O
on O
the O
modification O
of O
our O
Statute O
of O
Autonomy O
, O
without O
the O
agreement O
with O
us O
. O

The O
minister O
, O
despite O
declaring O
himself O
personally O
in O
favour O
, O
said O
that O
in O
the O
majority O
they O
are O
opposed O
. O

Calderoli B-PER
has O
also O
rejected O
our O
request O
that O
there O
be O
no O
simultaneous O
elections O

” O

Are O
you O
concerned O
that O
the O

three O

Calderoli B-PER

not O
make O

putting O
the O

We O
have O
suggested O

a O

it O
might O

the O

we O

This O

a O
few O

Simona B-PER

With O
her O
and O
with O
Simona B-PER
Torretta I-PER
, O
who O
has O
a O
great O
experience O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
we O
collaborated O
for O
the O
entire O
duration O
of O

, O
in O

until O
January O
of O

“ O
A B-ORG
bridge I-ORG
for I-ORG
” O
is O
the O
NGO O
that O
has O
been O
operating O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
for O
the O
longest O
time O
, O
even O
since O
1991 O
. O

Before O
the O
war O
with O
only O
one O
person O
, O
then O
with O
two O
or O
three O
operatives O
and O
some O
volunteers O
( O
in O
addition O
to O
Iraqi O
employees O
) O
. O

It O
deals O
with O
programs O
ranging O
from O
health O
( O
distribution O
of O
medicines O
, O
support O
to O
children O
) O
, O
to O
public O
health O
( O
works O

, O
to O
cultural O
and O

according O
to O

principles O

and O
solidarity O
. O

Bertoldi B-PER
talks O
about O
two O
busy O
, O
extremely O
prepared O
girls O
, O
ready O
to O
fall O
into O
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
place O
, O
so O
that O
they O
have O
no O
embarrassment O
to O
turn O
around O
the O
streets O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
with O
the O
veil O
covering O
their O
hair O
. O

When O
did O
Bertoldi B-PER
hear O
Torretta B-PER
and O
Pari B-PER
? O

With O
Torretta B-PER
we O
met O
in O
late O
April O
, O
while O
with O
Pari B-PER
we O
heard O
via O
chat O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
. O

Are O
they O
afraid O
of O
their O
uncertainty O
? O

They O
told O
me O
that O
from O
Italy B-LOC
the O
situation O
seemed O
to O
be O
worse O
than O
it O
really O
was O
. O

What O
can O
civilian O
volunteers O
do O
to O
work O
with O
minimum O
security O
guarantees O
? O

The O
precautions O
are O
the O
usual O
ones O
: O

Keep O
a O
low O
profile O
, O
do O
not O
turn O
with O
guns O
or O
stockpile O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
you O
need O
to O
have O
a O
relationship O
with O
people O
. O

It O
transmits O
confidence O
, O
closeness O
to O
their O
problems O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
form O
of O
security O
. O

The O
element O
of O
novelty O
in O
the O
abduction O
of O
the O
two O
Italian O
girls O
is O
that O
for O
the O
first O
time O
they O
were O
targeted O
volunteers O
belonging O
to O
non O
- O
governmental O
forces O
, O
those O
who O
live O
in O
closer O
contact O
with O
people O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
understand O
. O

This O
leaves O
me O
astonished O
. O

When O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
, O
a O
rocket O
fell O
into O
the O
courtyard O
near O
the O
headquarters O
of O
“ O
A B-ORG
bridge I-ORG
for I-ORG
” O
the O
fact O
made O
me O
a O
little O
confused O
, O
but O
they O
had O
reassured O
me O
that O
it O
was O
a O
“ O
normal O
” O
shooting O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
my O
expectations O
were O
not O
entirely O
out O
of O
place O
. O

Where O
did O
his O
doubts O
come O
from O
? O

For O
a O
year O
our O
work O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
has O
gone O
well O
. O

But O
since O
March O
of O
this O
year O
, O
with O
the O
Al B-PER
Sadr I-PER
uprising O
in O
Falluja B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
has O
degenerated O
. O

Previously O
there O
was O
the O
resistance O
of O
the O
Islamic O
matrix O
, O
which O
however O
affected O
little O
because O
perceived O
by O
the O
population O
as O
a O
religious O
thing O
and O
brought O
from O
outside O
, O
and O
that O
linked O
to O
the O
old O
regime O
. O

These O
are O
organized O
structures O
that O
operate O
through O
heavy O
actions O
, O
but O
who O
knew O
where O
and O
how O
to O
hit O
. O

They O
know O
everything O
and O
everybody O
and O
have O
never O
attacked O
NGOs O
, O
especially O
those O
recognized O
as O
uncompromising O
with O
the O
occupants O
. O

Why O
were O
the O
two O
girls O
kidnapped O
? O

My O
first O
assumption O
was O
that O
they O
were O
not O
organized O
evilmen O
, O
but O
a O
gang O
of O
bandits O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
, O
however O
, O
that O
from O
what O
I O
learn O
from O
the O
internet O
there O
is O
the O
possibility O
that O
it O
was O
exactly O
a O
targeted O
attack O
on O
us O
. O

Why O
strike O
an O
organization O
that O
, O
beyond O
any O
ideology O
and O
flag O
, O
is O
committed O
to O
trying O
to O
give O
relief O
to O
the O
population O
? O

Probably O
to O
increase O
the O
emotional O
effect O
of O
their O
actions O
. O

Attacking O
an O
NGO O
means O
sending O
the O
message O
that O
the O
danger O
is O
global O
. O

I O
would O
not O
rule O
out O
the O
first O
possibility O
. O

Is O
there O
an O
attitude O
towards O
foreigners O
among O
the O
population O
? O

Until O
last O
January O
when O
I O
left O
Iraq B-LOC
I O
would O
say O
no O
. O

But O
that O
was O
a O
century O
ago O
. O

What O
happened O
then O
? O

Since O
March O
the O
situation O
has O
changed O
and O
, O
as O
I O
said O
earlier O
, O
degenerates O
from O
day O
to O
day O
. O

Rebellions O
, O
assaults O
and O
abductions O
happen O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
. O

If O
you O
first O
accepted O
occupation O
in O
exchange O
for O
liberation O
from O
Saddam B-PER
, O
then O
a O
new O
fact O
came O
into O
being O
, O
determined O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
winners O
of O
the O
old O
regime O
failed O
to O
guarantee O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
population O
and O
also O
a O
minimum O
of O
services O
. O

In O
short O
, O
there O
is O
no O
longer O
Saddam B-PER
, O
but O
people O
still O
live O
a O
life O
of O
hell O
. O

This O
summer O
, O
with O
the O
hellish O
heat O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
there O
was O
no O
water O
and O
no O
light O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
’m O
not O
saying O
that O
the O
Iraqis O
support O
those O
who O
make O
the O
uprisings O
, O
but O
surely O
something O
has O
changed O
. O

Is O
there O
a O
distinction O
between O
soldiers O
and O
civilians O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
primary O
target O
is O
always O
the O
American O
troops O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
distinction O
between O
military O
and O
civilian O
, O
between O
NGO O
volunteers O
and O
members O
of O
administrative O
offices O
, O
between O
Americans O
and O
others O
. O

... O
by O

However O
, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Simona B-PER
Pari I-PER
and O
Simona B-PER
Torretta I-PER
it O
was O
not O
so O
. O

Were O
they O
not O
kidnapped O
because O
of O
women O
? O

I O
do O
not O
believe O
. O

They O
have O
always O
been O
respectful O
of O
the O
traditions O
and O
religion O
of O
the O
country O
, O
never O
turning O
without O
the O
veil O
on O
their O
heads O
. O

The O

delegates O
, O
who O
represent O
the O
2,500 O
employees O
of O
the O
Houses O
of O
Rest O
of O
Trento B-LOC
, O
the O
critical O
points O
of O
a O
reform O
that O
makes O
debate O
. O

The O
draft O
regional O
law O
, O
approved O
by O
the O
legislative B-ORG
committee I-ORG
and O
awaiting O
to O
be O
examined O
by O
the O
regional B-ORG
council I-ORG
, O
provides O
for O
the O
transformation O
of O
the O
Houses O
of O
Rest O
into O
public O
companies O
of O
services O
to O
the O
person O
or O
into O
foundations O
of O
private O
law O
. O

A O
revolution O
for O
the O
44 O
provincial O
structures O
, O
which O
attend O
about O
three O
thousand O
guests O
. O

Trade O
unions O
have O
expressed O
concern O
about O
the O
lack O
of O
clarity O
of O
a O
law O
that O
emphasizes O
the O
rationalization O
of O
the O
cost O
management O
of O
structures O
, O
equating O
them O
in O
fact O
to O
private O
companies O
. O

It O
is O
feared O
that O
the O
services O
to O
the O
person O
will O
be O
reduced O
and O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
guest O
care O
will O
decline O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
IPAB B-ORG
staff O
, O
already O
insufficient O
and O
subject O
to O
excessive O
work O
rates O
, O
would O
also O
change O
the O
legal O
regime O
. O

It O
is O
expected O
that O
an O
autonomous O
bargaining O
department O
, O
of O
a O
privatistic O
nature O
, O
while O
today O
these O
workers O
are O
included O
in O
the O
bargaining O
department O
of O
the O
local O
authorities O
. O

The O
fear O
is O
that O
this O
may O
in O
the O
future O
lead O
to O
a O
reduction O
in O
wages O
already O
considered O
too O
low O
. O

Another O
controversial O
aspect O
concerns O
the O
position O
of O
directors O
and O
executives O
of O
the O
Houses O
of O
Rest O
, O
now O
employed O
with O
an O
indefinite O
contract O
, O
who O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
their O
work O
should O
go O
in O
wait O
, O
to O
have O
a O
private O
- O
type O
position O
linked O
to O
the O
board B-ORG
of I-ORG
directors I-ORG
. O

“ O
If O
there O
is O
no O
confrontation O
, O
” O
the O
unions O
say O
, O
“ O
we O
will O
mobilize O
the O
staff O
, O
not O
excluding O
a O
demonstration O
of O
protest O
in O
conjunction O
with O
the O
discussion O
in O
the O
regional O
council O

Analysis O
of O
Mark B-PER
Simenotti I-PER

It B-ORG
’s O
not O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

There O
are O
four O
home O

, O
one O
on O

, O
three O

, O
15 O

These O
are O
the O
numbers O
of O
the O
opening O
day O
of O
Excellence B-ORG
. O

The O
only O
two O
out O
- O
of O

the O

results O
were O
the O
4 O

0 O
outside O
of O
the O
Mori B-ORG
on O
the O
Natz B-ORG
and O
the O
unnet O
match O
between O
Alense B-ORG
and O
Salorno B-ORG
. O

But O
even O
in O
these O
cases O
, O
we O
ca O
n’t O
talk O
about O
the O
outcome O
: O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
formation O
of O
Zimelli B-PER
could O
defeat O
Natz B-ORG
was O
in O
fact O
in O
the O
numbers O
given O
that O
already O
last O
year O
it O
imposes O
on O
that O
field O
with O
a O
robot O
5 O
- O
3 O
and O
that O
its O
offensive O
potential O
, O
already O
stunning O
( O
remember O
the O
115 O
goals O
of O
the O
last O
two O
years O
) O
, O
is O
even O
more O
leavened O
now O
with O
the O
engagement O
of O
the O
very O
interesting O
Romanian O
Ionut B-PER
Alecu I-PER
, O
not O
by O
chance O
immediately O
to O
mark O
. O

Even O
the O
0 O
- O
0 O
of O
Ger O
can O
not O
be O
called O
impossible O
: O

In O
the O
first O
season O
out O
there O
can O
be O
that O
a O
team O
despite O
the O
ambitions O
and O
means O
of O
that O
of O
Ala B-LOC
can O
not O
put O
under O
an O
incomplete O
and O
revolutionary O
Salorno B-ORG
, O
but O
not O
for O
this O
less O
stimulated O
. O

The O
beautiful O
, O
and O
difficult O
, O
will O
continue O
with O
this O
charge O
of O
motivation O
and O
concentration O
to O
repeat O
( O
history O
has O
had O
similar O
aspects O
) O
the O
miracle O
of O
Comano B-ORG
last O
year O
. O

From O
the O
other O
fields O
the O
most O
significant O
notes O
concern O
Albiano B-ORG
and O
Vallagarina B-ORG
able O
to O
make O
the O
best O
use O
of O
the O
internal O
turn O
to O
bend O
hostile O
rivals O
such O
as O
Rovereto B-ORG
and O
Merano B-ORG
. O

These O
are O
gold O
points O
especially O
for O
the O
absences O
that O
both O
accused O
: O

In B-PER
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use B-PER
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
limited B-PER
to O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product B-PER
or O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
or O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product B-PER
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
heavy O
absences O
something O
also O
complains O
the O
Benacense B-ORG
that O
in O
the O
big O
- O
match O
of O
Ponte B-LOC
Arche I-LOC
had O
to O
give O
up O
two O
stockers O
such O
as O
Delnegro B-PER
and O
Cosa B-PER
resulting O
rather O
stunted O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
traditionally O
stronger O
backward O
division O
of O
the O
tournament O
, O
that O
of O
Comano B-ORG
Fiavè I-ORG
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
almost O
obvious O
that O
the O
distribution O
of O
the O
mail O
without O
real O
emotions O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O

Presented O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
at O
the O
Venice O
Festival O
, O
it O
is O
a O
touching O
and O
lucid O
film O
and O
tells O
the O
true O
story O
of O
Ramon B-PER
Sampedro I-PER
, O
a O
tetraplegic O
forced O
to O
bed O
for O
twenty O
- O
eight O
years O
, O
who O

, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
performers O
you O
can O
meet O
on O
film O
sets O
around O

world O
. O

A O
fugitive O
movement O
of O
the O
face O
, O
a O
crunching O
of O
the O
voice O
, O
are O
enough O
for O
Bardem B-PER
to O
open O
a O
world O
, O
to O
arouse O
you O
valleys O
of O
emotions O
. O

The O
theme O
is O
death O
, O
and O
the O
legal O
battle O
to O
get O
permission O
to O
embark O
on O
the O
sweet O
death O
is O
very O
tough O
. O

More O
than O
on O
the O
legal O
and O
civil O
side O
, O
the O
film O
focuses O
primarily O
on O
the O
human O
dimension O
of O
those O
who O
have O
decided O

There O
are O
three O

play O
it O
only O
on O

that O

“ O
My O
opinion O
is O
that O
you O
must O
comply O
with O
the O
regulation O
and O
if O
you O
can O
not O
enter O
the O

you O
should O
not O

it O

” O

For O
him O
, O
wanting O
to O
allow O
Muslim O
women O
to O
respect O
their O
religious O
dictates O
, O
there O
would O
be O
another O
solution O
. O

In O
Muslim O
countries O
there O
are O
mixed O
swimming O
pools O
, O
but O
also O
swimming O
pools O
reserved O
only O
for O
men O
and O
only O
for O
women O
. O

If O
it O
can O
be O
implemented O
in O
Italy B-LOC
, O
why O
not O
? O

It O
would O
not O
be O
against O
the O
law O

” O

But O
if O
the O
reserved O
pools O
were O
not O
built O
, O
“ O
then O
my O
advice O
is O
not O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Lido O
, O
” O
he O
concluded O

In O
addition O

this O
, O
it O
is O
important O

keep O
in O

that O
the O
use O

this O

“ O
The O
issue O
has O
two O
aspects O
: O

One O
is O
cultural O
and O
the O
other O
is O
hygienic O

For O
the O
cultural O
, O
I O
remember O
that O
our O
grandmothers O
went O
to O
the O
sea O
completely O
covered O
from O
head O
down O
, O
with O
absolutely O
whole O
costumes O
. O

Bathing O
clothes O
are O
getting O
smaller O
. O

As O
for O
the O
hygienic O
appearance O
, O
it O
is O
enough O
to O
provide O
in O
the O
laundry O
bathrooms O
where O
to O
wash O
these O
costumes O
, O
these O
tunics O
, O
before O
entering O
the O
water O
. O

Before O
entering O
the O
pool O
, O
you O
should O
take O
a O
shower O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
’s O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
filters O

Until O
a O
few O
years O

, O
for O

the O

mandatory O

In O

that O

The O
institution O
bought O
its O
apartment O
in O
2002 O
, O
when O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
cover O
the O
hole O
of O
£ O
14 O
billion O
that O
had O
opened O
up O
in O
the O
Csc B-ORG
accounts O
. O

“ O
I O
learned O
that O
that O
house O
was O
for O
sale O
in O
the O
early O
’ O
96s O
. O

I O
was O
thirty O
years O
old O
and O
did O
n’t O
have O
the O
money O
to O
buy O
the O
house O
. O

They O
were O
enough O
for O
me O
in O
advance O
, O
so O
I O
chose O
to O
buy O
from O
a O
cooperative O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
house O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
saw O
it O
. O

It O
’s O
called O
love O
at O
first O
sight O
. O

It O
is O
a O
loft O
of O
68 O
square O
meters O
scarce O
and O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
it O
in O
advance O
in O
addition O
to O
a O
fixed O
monthly O
fee O
of O
629 O
thousand O
liras O
for O
fifteen O
years O
. O

I O
made O
my O
accounts O
and O
thought O
I O
could O
stay O
inside O
. O

So O
I O
decided O
to O
buy O
. O

Here O
began O
the O
first O
problems O
because O
when O
I O
asked O
when O
the O
house O
would O
become O
mine O
I O
became O
vague O
. O

I O
was O
told O
that O
after O
the O
fifteen O
years O
there O
would O
be O
something O
to O
pay O
, O
but O
that O
the O
Province B-LOC
would O
intervene O
politically O
and O
that O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
balance O
would O
not O
be O
excessive O
. O

I O
entered O
the O
apartment O
in O
July O
1996 O
. O

The O
following O
month O
we O
talked O
about O
debt O
contracts O
to O
build O
the O
building O
where O
I O
lived O
. O

At O
first O
, O
however O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
few O
million O
. O

We O
continued O
so O
, O
in O
uncertainty O
, O
until O
December O
' O
96 O
. O

It O
was O
at O
that O
point O
that O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
CSC B-ORG
told O
us O
that O
the O
debts O
incurred O
on O
my O
palace O
amounted O
to O
£ O
800 O
million O
. O

Thro O
the O
palace O
there O
are O
18 O
apartments O
, O
so O
the O
debt O
for O
each O
of O
us O
amounted O
to O
about O
£ O
40 O
million O
. O

We O
had O
to O
pay O
more O
than O
we O
had O
paid O
so O
far O
. O

They O
told O
us O
that O
that O
debt O
had O
been O
accumulated O
because O
provincial O
funding O
had O
arrived O
late O
and O
they O
had O
to O
find O
mortgages O
on O
the O
banking O
market O
. O

We O
checked O
with O
all O
the O
bills O
that O
it O
could O
not O
have O
gone O
that O
way O
, O
because O
, O
otherwise O
, O
the O
interest O
would O
have O
been O
very O
high O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
CSC B-ORG
asked O
us O
for O
$ O
20 O
million O
immediately O
and O
another O
$ O
20 O
million O
with O
monthly O
payments O
. O

There O
was O
no O
guarantee O
, O
however O
, O
that O
they O
would O
be O
the O
last O
. O

We O
decided O
not O
to O
pay O
. O

The O
following O
year O
, O
other O
interventions O
began O
to O
go O
badly O
. O

The O
situation O
precipitated O
within O
a O
few O
months O
until O
' O
99 O
when O
there O
were O
already O
four O
or O
five O
billion O
pounds O
of O
debt O
. O

In O
order O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
in O
2000 O
, O
the O
Csc B-ORG
’s O
heads O
requested O
and O
obtained O
a O
third O
mortgage O
on O
all O
properties O
. O

So O
it O
became O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
it O
was O
now O
impossible O
to O
repay O
all O
that O
money O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
2001 O
, O
then O
, O
the O
liquidation O
of O
the O
Csc B-ORG
was O
decided O
, O
the O
debt O
had O
reached O
14 O
billion O
. O

, O
I O

the O

tenants O
in O
my O

who O
refused O
to O
pay O
the O

As O
for O
Cassano B-PER

“ O
I O
say O
it O

not O
right O
to O
leave O
Rome B-LOC

In O
the O
field O
it O
is O
definitely O
a O
model O
to O
follow O
in O
everything O

for O
everything O
; O

It O
is O
often O
judged O
by O
what O
it O
does O
out O

it O
is O
the O
price O
to O
be O
paid O

We O

are O
often O
hard O
to O
endure O
, O

in O

not O
so O
bad O

In O

, O
not O
even O
nationally B-ORG

“ O
I O
said O
and O
I O
repeat O
that O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
how O
many O

would O
have O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
get O
me O
to O
start O
at O

, O
as O
Lippi B-PER
did O
. O

A O
comparison O
with O
the O
blue O

? O

I O
would O
be O
presumptuous O
, O
and O
then O
I O
say O
the O
truth O
: O

I O
have O
seen O
very O
few O
of O
them O
live O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
of O
Tardelli B-PER

but O
of O
him O
I O
only O
remember O
the O
World O
Scream O
. O

There O
were O
Albertini B-PER
and O
Giannini B-PER
. O

Of O
those O
around O
today O
I O
like O
Lampard B-PER
and O
Gerrard B-PER
, O
but O
the O
strongest O
are O
Vieira B-PER
and O
Emerson B-PER

And O
if O
the O
latter O
name O
may O
sound O
like O
an O
additional O
pro O
- O
Juve B-ORG
indication O
, O
to O
counterbalance O
it O
there O
are O
preferences O
in O
the O
subject O
of O

: O

Völler B-PER
was O
my O
idol O
as O
a O

. O

Once O
I O
met O
him O
, O
I O
say O
he O
’s O
a O
man O
of O

and O
praises O
. O

I O
admire O
Mancini B-PER
and O
then O
Prandelli B-PER
. O

He O
has O
a O
spongy O
game O

unfortunately O
I O
only O
worked O
with O
him O
for O
a O

So O
much O

Although O

“ O

The O

Most O
of O

it O
turns O

the O
only O
structure O
that O

a O
relatively O
low O
number O

In O

the O

In O
this O
sense O
, O

also O
for O

, O
the O

urged O

In O

Today O
in O
the O
Committee O

researched O

The O
reform O
is O
discussed O

This O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
world O
’s O
economy B-ORG
. O

The O
reform O
envisages O
the O
transformation O
of O
the O
ITC B-ORG
and O
the O
Agricultural B-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
San I-ORG
Michele I-ORG
into O
foundations O
, O
and O
the O
introduction O
of O
greater O
autonomy O
and O
flexibility O
in O
research O
work O
. O

Less O
political O
appointments O
, O
more O
choices O
related O
to O
specific O
competence O
. O

In O
one O
word O
: O

and O
greater O
transparency O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
this O
in O
short O
the O
inspiring O
principle O
of O
the O
provincial O
reform O
law O
with O
which O
the O
ITC B-ORG
( O
and O
its O
statute O
) O
will O
be O
transformed O
, O
destined O
to O
become O
the O
Bruno B-ORG
Kessler I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
, O
in O
honor O
of O
its O
promoter O
. O

“ O
The O
complete O
discretion O
of O
the O
board O
regarding O
the O
appointments O
of O
its O
competence O
is O
missing O
, O
” O
explains O
Innovation O
Advisor O
Gianluca B-PER
Salvatori I-PER
. O

“ O
This O
choice O
demonstrates O
how O
unfounded O
objections O
are O
about O
the O
risk O
of O
flatening O
the O
autonomy O
of O
the O
institution O
, O
” O
Salvatori B-PER
adds O
. O

So O
the O
old O
( O
unwritten O
) O
rules O
on O
party O
appointments O
are O
deleted O
from O
those O
( O
written O
, O
this O
time O
) O
that O
guarantee O
balances O
more O
consistent O
with O
the O
purposes O
of O
the O
institute B-ORG
now O
, O
and O
of O
the O
foundation B-ORG
then O

The O
case O

The O
unknown O

stopped O
without O
a O

in O

given O
false O

But O
it O
is O
not O

This O
is O

This B-PER
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O

In O
addition O
to O
this O

it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
use O
of O

is O
not O

the O
quality O

no O

had O
happened O

That O
evening O
in O
late O
May O
the O
controller O
present O
on O
the O
bus O
stopped O
a O
stranger O
who O
provided O
false O
generalizations O
, O
giving O
the O
name O
and O
surname O
of O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
a O
human O
being O
. O

If O
there O
was O
a O
need O
for O
a O
second O
confirmation O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
young O
man O
on O
the O
bus O
was O
not O
Marco B-PER
, O
here O
is O
the O
record O
in O
which O
a O
false O
address O
, O
a O
wrong O
date O
of O
birth O
and O
a O
signature O
completely O
different O
from O
his O
appears O
. O

But O
at O
home O
the O
penalty O
was O
there O
and O
somehow O
the O
matter O
had O
to O
be O
resolved O
. O

" O
The O
inspector O
- O
the O
protagonist O
of O
the O
case O
complains O
rightly O
- O
wrote O
the O
minutes O
without O
verifying O
through O
document O
the O
truthfulness O
of O
the O
generalities O
provided O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
infringement O

So O
now O
I O
have O
to O
answer O
for O
a O
transgression O
committed O
by O
another O
person O
who O
, O
however O
, O
in O
voice O
, O
I O
repeat O
in O
voice O
, O
gave O
my O

while O
the O
date O
of O
birth O
, O
the O
address O
and O
the O
civic O
number O
are O
different O

as O

as O
the O
signature O
completely O
unreadable O

Now O
the O
attacked O

have O
decided O
to O
prosecute O
the O

and O
the O
Health B-ORG

holding O
her O
responsible O

According O
to O
the O
law O
of O
the O
actors O
, O
the O
reason O
on O
which O
liability O
is O
based O
lies O
in O
the O
failure O
by O
the O
Healthcare B-ORG
Company I-ORG
to O
fulfill O
the O
obligation O
to O
prevent O
the O
harmful O
event O

This O
obligation O
is O
due O
to O
those O
who O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
could O
prevent O
the O
aggression O
. O

It O
is O
the O
Company B-ORG
, O
since O
, O
according O
to O
the O
assailant O
and O
the O
husband O
, O
he O
had O
to O
watch O
the O
neighbor O
as O
he O
had O
given O
signs O
of O
psychological O
instability O
several O
times O
. O

The O
attacker O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
events O
was O
subject O
to O
psychiatric O
medical O
treatment O
by O
the O
Healthcare B-ORG
Company I-ORG
. O

His O
psychological O
condition O
, O
characterized O
by O
violence O
and O
aggressiveness O
, O
had O
already O
been O
revealed O
in O
1979 O
, O
when O
from O
the O
window O
of O
his O
home O
he O
had O
shot O
with O
the O
rifle O
against O
the O
house O
of O
the O
neighbors O
attacked O
twenty O
years O
later O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
episode O
, O
the O
man O
was O
locked O
in O
a O
criminal O
hospice O
in O
Castiglione B-LOC
delle I-LOC
Stiviere I-LOC
from O
which O
he O
managed O
to O
escape O

He O
underwent O
compulsory O
medical O
treatment O
in O
1980 O
and O
1997 O
. O

In O
1996 O
he O
shot O
the O
car O
of O
the O
Carabinieri B-ORG
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
aggression O
, O
the O
man O
lived O
isolated O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
in O
his O
home O
. O

According O
to O
the O
attacker O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Health B-ORG
Company I-ORG
had O
never O
done O
anything O
to O
monitor O
and O
limit O
the O
man O
. O

The O
assailant O
suffered O
from O
a O
real O
delirium O
of O
persecution O
. O

This O
is O
why O
he O
attacked O
the O
woman O
by O
accusing O
her O
of O
attaching O
something O
to O
his O
back O
and O
then O
accusing O
her O
of O
killing O
his O
rabbits O
. O

The O
pathology O
of O
man O
has O
long O
been O
known O
to O
the O

But O
, O
according O
to O

The O

it O

But O
also O
- O
the O
novelty O
appeared O
only O
yesterday O
black O
on O
white O
- O
the O
possibility O
of O
holding O

the O

that O

Today O
, O
however O
, O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
’s O
regulation O
stipulates O
that O
the O
resources O
not O
used O
within O
each O
year O
must O
be O
returned O
to O
the O
provincial O
budget O
. O

This O
is O
why O
Margherita B-ORG
decided O
yesterday O
not O
to O
question O
the O
agreement O
reached O
with O
part O
of O
the O
opposition O
- O
in O
particular O
with O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
, O
the O
head O
group O
of O
the O

- O
despite O
the O
left O
's O
no O
to O

. O

" O
It O
is O
the O
no O
of O
a O

like O
another O
, O
" O
commented O
yesterday O
Giorgio B-PER
Casagranda I-PER
, O
head O
of O
the O
Civica B-ORG
group O
, O
who O
also O
liquidated O
the O
request O
of O
the O
main O
ally O
of O
the O
government O
to O
postpone O
the O
discussion O
in O
the O
provincial O
council O
by O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
transversal O
majority O
- O
without O
the O
SDR B-ORG
- O
submitted O
amendments O
to O
the O
proposal O
of O
the O

to O
obtain O
all O
the O
increases O
in O
personnel O
and O

that O
had O
been O
agreed O
between O
the O

Northern B-ORG

, O
An B-ORG
and O
Pino B-PER
Morandini I-PER
of O
the O
Udc B-ORG
) O
. O

The O
only O
point O
on O
which O
the O
SDR B-ORG
also O
decided O
yesterday O
to O
place O
its O
signature O
, O
along O
with O
the O
others O
, O
is O
that O
concerning O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
advisory O
fund O
. O

“ O
There O
is O
no O
political O
problem O
, O
” O
says O
Paolo B-PER
Barbacovi I-PER
, O
leader O
of O
the O
SDR B-ORG
, O
“ O
even O
if O
Margherita B-ORG
signs O
the O
amendments O
with O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
and O
we O
do O
not O
agree O
, O
because O
this O
is O
not O
a O
topic O
that O
is O
part O
of O
the O
legislative O
agenda O
. O

Every O
political O
force O
is O
free O
to O
regulate O
itself O
as O
it O
thinks O
. O
” O

The O
amendment O
provides O
for O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
fund O
in O
the O
provincial O
budget O
for O
the O
conduct O
of O
studies O
by O
groups O
. O

The O
fund O
, O
according O
to O
the O
proposal O
introduced O
by O
the O
Sdr B-ORG
, O
welcoming O
a O
request O
of O
Catalan B-PER
( O
Rifondazione B-ORG
) O
, O
is O
allocated O
by O
half O
to O
minority O
groups O
and O
by O
half O
to O
the O
majority O
. O

Each O
group O
shall O
indicate O
the O
costs O
incurred O
and O
the O
studies O
funded O
by O
the O
Fund O
. O

With O
what O
money O
will O
this O
fund O
be O
funded O
? O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
for O
this O
year O
, O
as O
proposed O
by O
a O
Catalan B-PER
agenda O
, O
the O
resources O
will O
be O
sought O
on O
other O
items O
of O
the O
budget O
, O
without O
increasing O
the O
expenses O
, O
but O
of O
course O
for O
the O
next O
budgets O
will O
not O
be O
so O
. O

The O
transversal O
agreement O
provides O
for O
a O
new O
table O
on O
the O
staffing O
of O
the O
groups O
, O
allowing O
in O
fact O
the O
hiring O
of O
a O
total O
of O
5 O
additional O
people O
( O
estimated O
cost O
250 O
thousand O
euros O
) O
at O
a O
level O
equivalent O
to O
category O
D O
( O
graduates O
) O
. O

It O
is O
also O
proposed O
to O
increase O
the O
salaries O
of O
staff O
by O
25 O
% O
. O

Currently O
, O
the O
employees O
of O
the O
groups O
are O
35 O
. O

It O
also O
requires O
employees O
to O
have O
a O
car O
seat O
. O

Travel O
- O
Today O
the O
regulation O
provides O
for O
an O
allocation O
of O
approximately O
6 O
thousand O
refundable O
kilometers O
for O
each O
advisor O
. O

However O
, O
many O
consultants O
do O
not O
use O
them O
and O
do O
not O
ask O
for O
a O
refund O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
groups O
propose O
that O
instead O
of O
dividing O
the O
kilometers O
between O
the O
councillors O
, O
all O
the O
equipment O
can O
be O
managed O
by O
the O
head O
of O
the O
group O
, O
who O
will O
distribute O
the O
kilometers O
according O
to O
the O
needs O
. O

It O
will O
be O
easier O
to O
use O
them O
all O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
group O
will O
be O
able O
to O
ask O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
council B-ORG
for O
other O
reimbursements O
for O
political O
missions O
. O

Reporting O
– O
The O
Left O
group O
remained O
only O
in O
the O
request O
for O
a O
transparent O
report O
on O
how O
resources O
are O
used O
by O
groups O
. O

Margherita B-ORG
- O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
and O
the O
others O
of O
the O
cross O
- O
majority O
accept O
only O
a O
summary O
report O
, O
which O
does O
not O
require O
the O
presentation O
of O
invoices O
and O
receipts O
to O
prove O
the O

made O
. O

L.P. B-PER

The O

: O

“ O

In O

to O
Maurizio B-PER
Nichetti I-PER
, O
artistic O
director O
, O
the O
director O
of O
the O

out O
of O

” O
President O
Italo B-PER
Zandonella I-PER
Callegher I-PER
said O
. O

" O
After O
two O
editions O
dedicated O
to O
the O
reorganization O
of O
the O

, O
we O
decided O
to O
find O
the O
figure O
that O
the O
Statute O
provides O
: O

The O
artistic O
director O
. O

Nichetti B-PER
is O
exactly O
the O
person O
the O
Festival O
was O
looking O
for O
, O
and O
I O
am O
proud O
of O
this O
choice O
. O
” O

Zandonella B-PER
did O
not O
want O
to O
disclose O
how O
much O
the O
employment O
amounted O
. O

“ O
No O
, O
I O
will O
not O
say O
it O
until O
the O
contract O
is O
signed O
. O

Calm O
anyway O
. O

Nicole B-PER
did O
n’t O
come O
for O
the O

. O

He O
will O
have O
an O
annual O
contract O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
renewal O
. O
” O

The O
president O
of O
the O
Film O
Festival O
then O
recalled O
that O
the O
heavy O
debt O
previously O
borne O
has O
been O
abolished O
. O

“ O
In O
a O
few O
days O
there O
will O
be O
the O
arbitration O
that O
will O
have O
to O
decide O
on O
the O
debt O
we O
owe O
to O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
for O
the O
S.Chiara O
, O
but O
we O
are O
optimistic O
that O
a O
just O
solution O
will O
be O
reached O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
has O
allocated O
100,000 O
euros O
, O
50,000 O
the O
Cai B-ORG

20,000 O
the O
Municipality B-LOC

As O
for O
the O
request O
that O
the O
Cai B-ORG
engage O
more O
in O
the O
Filmfestival O
, O
repeatedly O
requested O
by O
the O
outgoing O
director O
Augusto B-PER
Golin I-PER
( O
who O
yesterday O
was O
not O
present O
at O
the O
official O

of O
Nichetti B-PER
in O

, O
Zandonella B-PER
stated O
that O
“ O
there O
is O
no O

, O
which O
fully O
cooperates O
with O
the O
realization O
of O
the O

” O
. O

Zandonella B-PER
also O
wanted O
to O
clarify O
that O
“ O
no O

been O
defenestrated O
( O
the O

The O
Ct O
of O

who O
spoke O
of O
Henry B-PER

The O
Aragonese B-PER
: O

“ O
Tell O
the O
Negro O
. O
” O

“ O
You O
have O
to O
see O
things O
more O
clearly O

So O
tell O

you O

better O

Tell O
it O

: O

You O

him O

” O

It O
is O
the O
dialectical O
slide O
of O
the O
Spanish B-ORG
ct O
Luis B-PER

during O

addressed O
his O

this O

who O
in O

makes O
a O

with O
the O

that O
Aragones B-PER

just O
called O

His O
phrase O

heard O
by O
the O
Spanish O
journalists O

the O
session O
, O
has O
already O
provoked O
a O
sea O
of O

Aragones B-PER
with O
his O
phrase O
meant O
that O
in O
England B-LOC
many O
praises O

made O
to O
Henry B-PER
( O
also O
referred O
to O

" O

, O

forgetting O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
French O

are O
the O
fruit O
of O
the O
work O
of O
the O
whole O
team O

and O
in O
particular O
of O
Reyes B-PER
who O
tried O
anyway O
to O
excuse O
his O
ct O
: O

“ O
It O
was O
a O

” O
he O
said O

These O
are O
things O
that O

In O
addition O
to O
this B-LOC
, I-LOC
it I-LOC
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

The O
shareholders O
of O
the O
company O
, O
chaired O
by O
Gino B-PER
Lunelli I-PER
and O
led O
since O
last O
year O
by O
Matteo B-PER
Lunelli I-PER
, O
the O
third O
generation O
of O
the O
family O
, O
have O
decided O
to O
deposit O
all O
the O
net O
profit O
recorded O
during O
the O
last O
fiscal O
year O
, O
preferring O
to O
strengthen O
the O
already O
rich O
resources O
of O
the O
treasury O
rather O
than O
collect O
generous O
dividends O
in O
their O
turn O
. O

Therefore O
, O
all O
the O
€ O
3.9 O
million O
of O
the O
profit O
that O
the O
holding O
company O
achieved O
during O
the O
financial O
year O
2003 O
were O
allocated O
as O
an O
extraordinary O
reserve O
. O

This O
is O
far O
from O
the O
EUR O
24.2 O
million O
raised O
in O
the O
previous O
year O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
record O
result O
( O
+345 O
% O
) O
had O
been O
achieved O
thanks O
to O
the O
remarkable O
growth O
of O
revenues O
guaranteed O
by O
controlled O
companies O
. O

During O
2003 O
, O
these O
last O
amounted O
to O
15.5 O
million O
euros O
. O

In O
2002 O
, O
however O
, O
the O
contribution O
of O
the O
subsidiaries O
had O
exceeded O
40 O
million O
euros O
( O
+276 O
% O
compared O
to O
the O
previous O
fiscal O
year O
) O
. O

A O
considerable O
part O
of O
these O
financial O
resources O
had O
come O
from O
Ferrari B-ORG
F.lli I-ORG
Lunelli I-ORG
Spa I-ORG
, O
owner O
of O
the O
“ O
Ferrari O
” O
brand O
and O
the O
Ravina B-LOC
foammaker O
. O

The O
company O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
had O
secured O
an O
extraordinary O
flow O
of O
liquidity O
through O
a O
real O
estate O
spin O
- O
off O
operation O
. O

After O
that O
peak O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
result O
of O
the O
exercise O
returned O
to O
“ O
ordinary O
” O
tracks O
, O
although O
it O
remains O
significantly O
lower O
than O
the O
previous O
levels O
( O
7.02 O
million O
in O
2001 O
) O
. O

It O
is O
also O
due O
to O
a O
heavy O
devaluation O
, O
amounting O
to O
9.7 O
million O
euros O
, O
carried O
out O
on O
account O
of O
the O
stake O
held O
in O
the O
subsidiary O
Vinifin B-ORG

This O
latter O
, O
after O
the O
approval O
, O
in O
November O
last O
year O
, O
of O
an O
extraordinary O
budget O
that O
recorded O
a O
substantial O
loss O
of O
operation O
, O
saw O
its O
accounts O
further O
aggravated O
in O
the O
following O
months O
, O
so O
much O
as O
to O
push O
the O
members O
to O
cover O
the O
losses O
by O
resorting O
to O
the O
reserves O
and O
the O
reduction O
of O
capital O
. O

The O
subsequent O
devaluation O
of O
the O
holding O
had O
a O
considerable O
impact O
on O
the O
holding O
company O
’s O
financial O
account O
. O

This O
impact O
was O
offset O
by O
the O
good O
progress O
of O
the O
other O
controlled O
companies O
. O

On O
top O
of O
all O
, O
the O
Ferrari B-ORG

which O
consolidated O
its O
positions O
, O
despite O
the O
not O
easy O
national O

, O
with O
a O

283.721 O

With O

to O
the O
latter O
, O
the O
head O
group O
faced O
a O
capital O
increase O
of O
EUR O
3.2 O

In O
the O
course O
of O
2003 O
, O
the O

The O
ICEF O
, O
according O
to O
its O
symbolic O
“ O
father O
” O
, O
the O
economist O
Gianfranco B-PER
Cerea I-PER
, O
responds O
to O
the O
absolute O
unreliability O
of O
the O
national O
tax O
system O
, O
which O
leaves O
wide O
margins O
for O
abuses O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
the O
Isee O
which O
is O
based O
on O
calculating O
the O
economic O
availability O
of O
a O
family O
on O
gross O
income O
, O
the O
ICEF O
– O
explained O
Gilberto B-PER
Barbieri I-PER
, O
of O
the O
company O
Clesius B-ORG
– O
takes O
into O
account O
the O
“ O
available O
income O
” O
, O
from O
which O
have O
been O
deducted O
, O
that O
is O
, O
expenses O
such O
as O
the O
insurance O
or O
the O
payment O
of O
the O
mortgage O
of O
a O
home O
, O
thus O
ensuring O
greater O
equity O
in O
the O
granting O
of O
benefits O
. O

And O
then O
the O
flexibility O
: O

" O
Imagine O
, O
" O
says O
Cerea B-PER
, O
yesterday O
at O
the O
speakers O
' O
table O
, O
" O
facilitated O
access O
to O
a O
service O
like O
a O
cake O
. O

With O
the O
Icef O
you O
have O
various O
ingredients O
( O
property O
, O
income O
, O
deductions O
, O
franchises O
, O
etc O
. O
) O
well O
arranged O
in O
virtual O

. O

Depending O
on O
the O
criteria O
established O
to O
access O
a O
given O
service O
, O
whether O
it O
is O
home O
or O
transportation O
, O
you O
recall O
the O
necessary O
data O
and O
determine O
whether O
the O
person O
is O
entitled O
to O
benefits O
or O
not O
. O

With O
the O
Isee O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
you O
get O
an O
index O
that O
must O
then O
be O
used O
for O
any O
service O
. O
” O

And O
if O
in O
Cisl B-ORG
and O
Uil B-ORG
the O
explanations O
of O
Cerea B-PER
seem O
convincing O
- O
" O
earlier O
we O
were O
hesitant O
in O
leaving O
the O
Isee O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
local O
system O
now O
we O
changed O
our O
minds O
" O
says O
Ermanno B-PER

secretary O
- O
the O
forced O
smile O
of O
the O
number O
one O
of O
Cgil B-ORG
Ruggero B-PER
Purin I-PER
has O
left O
some O
annoyance O
for O
the O
back O
front O
of O
the O
colleagues O
. O

In O
his O
introductory O
report O
he O
targeted O
precisely O
the O
flexibility O
of O
the O
system O
based O
on O
the O
ICEF O
, O
“ O
which O
risks O
becoming O
discretionary O
by O
the O
administration O
. O
” O

“ O
The O
choice O
of O
different O
methods O
and O
parameters O
depending O
on O
the O
performance O
– O
Purin B-PER
argued O
– O
could O
vilify O
the O
actual O
consistency O
of O
the O
law O
. O
” O

But O
the O
vil O
money O
also O
has O
its O
part O
in O
explaining O
the O
doubts O
of O
the O
Cgil B-ORG
: O

" O
While O
it O
is O
the O
State O
through O
the O
Inps O
to O
pay O
for O
every O
Isee O
model O
compiled O
- O
explains O
Ferruccio B-PER
Morandi I-PER
, O
head O
of O
Caaf B-ORG
Cgil I-ORG
- O
if O
we O
switched O
to O
the O
Icef O
model O
, O
the O
Province B-LOC
would O
have O
to O
pay O
the O
doors O
20 O

25 O
euros O

. O

And O
if O
you O
think O
these O
could O
be O
between O
100,000 O
and O
150,000 O
, O
the O
count O
is O
soon O
done O
. O

Why O
not O
use O
this O
money O
to O
actually O
reduce O
service O
fees O
? O

It O
is O
not O
bad O
really O
for O

once O

Mori B-ORG
, O
able O
to O
start O
in O
the O
first O
team O
since O
the O
age O
of O
sixteen O
. O

It O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
get O
to O
know O
what O
we O
’re O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
. O

And O
the O
reflectors O
move O
on O
him O
. O

How O
do O
you O
experience O
this O
moment O
of O
glory O
? O

With O
the O
utmost O
serenity O
. O

I O
started O
well O
as O
I O
did O
last O
year O
( O
even O
then O
he O
scored O
on O
the O
first O
day O
against O
Natz B-ORG
, O
ndr O
) O
and O
I O
hope O
to O
continue O
like O
this O
. O

Not O
so O
much O
for O
me O
as O
for O
the O
team O
that O
is O
competitive O
and O
can O
aspire O
to O
a O
top O
championship O
. O

Let O
’s O
say O
we O
can O
bet O
on O
the O
podium O
if O
we O
only O
know O
how O
to O
maintain O
the O
right O
concentration O
and O
condition O
. O

It O
will O
be O
determining O
your O
realising O
vein O
but O
especially O
that O
of O
Luca B-PER
Bonazza I-PER
, O
the O
undisputed O
king O
of O
the O
goal O
. O

How O
is O
it O
to O
play O
next O
to O
you O
? O

Is O
it O
better O
or O
worse O
for O
the O
second O
? O

“ O
It O
’s O
a O
huge O
advantage O
to O
have O
a O
man O
like O
him O
, O
who O
is O
undoubtedly O
the O
best O
attacker O
in O
the O
region B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
the O
central O
point O
of O
reference O
and O
already O
this O
creates O
spaces O
and O
greatly O
facilitates O
the O
task O
of O
those O
who O
must O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
sides O
, O
as O
it O
belongs O
to O
me O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
he O
can O
do O
the O
shore O
and O
support O
very O
well O
, O
in O
short O
, O
it O
is O
too O
easy O
with O
one O
like O
that O
. O

But O
in O
the O
sound O
of O
goals O
and O
prowess O
it O
takes O
away O
a O
bit O
of O
visibility O
. O

And O
then O
he O
beat O
all O
the O
rigors O
: O

Do O
n’t O
you O
get O
a O
bit O
jealous O
of O
this O
? O

It O
is O
also O
a O
comfortable O
situation O
. O

If O
everyone O
thinks O
to O
stop O
him O
there O
are O
more O
opportunities O
for O
others O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
rigors O
are O
concerned O
, O
it O
is O
right O
that O
he O
beats O
them O
, O
who O
is O
a O
specialist O
, O
I O
like O
to O
score O
on O
action O
and O
I O
feel O
so O
well O
. O

What O
should O
be O
the O
goal O
this O
year O
? O

I O
would O
like O
to O
confirm O
the O
15 O
goals O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
success O
. O

It O
will O
be O
hard O
... O

But O
is O
there O
a O
secret O
behind O
your O
repetitive O
centers O
? O

Yes O
the O
luck O
. O

Too O
easy O
. O

They O
say O
it O
’s O
because O
of O
your O
passion O
for O
Pope B-PER
Winnie I-PER
. O

This O
is O
not O
new O
to O
me O
. O

Have O
you O
talked O
to O
someone O
from O
the O
team O
? O

I O
like O
Afro O
, O
Reggae O
and O
Happy O
Sound O
. O

It O
gives O
me O
the O
job O
and O
makes O
me O
play O
better O
. O

Do O
n’t O
write O
it O
, O
but O
you O
know O
how O
many O
times O
I O
’ve O
scored O
after O
a O
night O
at O
the O
disco O
with O
these O
rhythms O
? O

Of O
course O
I O
am O
not O
writing O
it O
. O

But O
on O
Saturday O
night O
the O
good O
footballer O
goes O
to O
sleep O
early O
, O
right O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
or O
at O
least O
not O
exaggerating O
. O

It O
requires O
measurement O
in O
everything O
. O

Back O
to O
football O
. O

Who O
will O
win O
this O
championship O
? O

If O
I O
have O
to O
make O
a O
name O
I O
only O
say O
Benacense B-ORG
because O
he O
has O
the O
most O
complete O
rose O
, O
with O
so O
many O
players O
of O
the O

If O
I O
can O
make O
two O
more O
, O
I O
add O
Brixen B-ORG

Alense B-ORG

I O
know O
I O
do O

" O
The O
third B-ORG
committee I-ORG
- O
continues O
Pinter B-PER
- O
in O
' O
95 O
had O
done O
an O
investigation O
into O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
establishing O
the O
park O
" O
Lagorai O
- O
Cima O
d'Asta O
" O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
petition O
that O
requested O
it O
. O

Even O
then O
we O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
will O
of O
the O
local O
realities O
concerned O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
creation O
of O
parks O
. O

And O
already O
then O
, O
as O
today O
, O
a O
debate O
developed O
that O
reveals O
a O
general O
ignorance O
about O
what O
it O
means O
natural O
park O
. O

In O
these O
days O
, O
many O
have O
equated O
the O
park O
to O
new O
constraints O
, O
to O
a O
confinement O
of O
the O
territory O
. O

It O
is O
not O
so O
, O
says O
the O
former O
urban O
planning O
adviser O
, O
this O
is O
propaganda O
and O
it O
is O
surprising O
to O
hear O
these O
statements O
even O
from O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
provincial O
tourism O
adviser O
, O
Tiziano B-PER
Mellaniri I-PER
, O
who O
proves O
that O
he O
does O
not O
know O
what O
parks O
are O
. O

And O
the O
provincial O
councillor O
of O
the O
SDR B-ORG
gives O
some O
examples O
: O

" O
The O
Pinzolo B-LOC
- O
Campiglio B-LOC
connection O
is O
located O
in O
part O
on O
the O
territory O
of O
Parco B-ORG
Adamello I-ORG
- O
Brenta O
, O
this O
does O
not O
prevent O
its O
realization O
. O

I O
will O
say O
more O
. O

In O
the O
area O
of O
the O
park O
, O
as O
regards O
the O
reuse O
of O
the O
building O
heritage O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
do O
what O
elsewhere O
you O
can O
not O
, O
for O
example O
, O
rebuild O
the O
debris O
. O
” O

The O
ex O
- O
urban O
counselor O
points O
out O
these O
aspects O
to O
say O
that O
: O

“ O
Natural O
parks O
are O
an O
opportunity O
for O
development O
and O
enhancement O
not O
only O
of O
environmental O
conservation O
. O
” O

" O
Paradoxically O
and O
therefore O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
statements O
of O
the O
mayor O
of O
Vallarsa B-LOC
, O
who O
says O
that O
he O
has O
preserved O
an O
integral O
territory O
and O
therefore O
does O
not O
need O
the O
park O
, O
- O
continues O
Pinter O
- O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
it O
is O
preserved O
more O
, O
from O
a O
natural O
point O
of O
view O
, O
a O
territory O
today O
unattractive O
, O
leaving O
it O
as O
it O
is O
rather O
than O
establishing O
the O
park O
. O
" O

“ O
You O
do O
n’t O
understand O
, O
” O
Pinter B-PER
concludes O
, O
“ O
that O
the O
park O
is O
an O
opportunity O
for O
development O
, O
it O
means O
keeping O
the O
mountain O
alive O
, O
it O
offers O
new O
opportunities O
, O
it O
is O
not O
just O
environmental O
conservation O

not O

No O
one O
recalled O
the O
newspaper O
to O
explain O
the O
reasons O
for O
one O
choice O

which O
satisfied O
some O

bittered O
others O

She O
speaks O

but O
with O
the O
promise O
of O
anonymity O
, O
a O
mother O
: O

“ O
My O
children O
are O
going O
to O
school O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
want O
them O
to O
suffer O
consequences O
, O
since O
that O
teacher O
is O
still O
working O

” O

It O
is O
not O
fearful O
that O
now O
, O
with O
a O
new O
substitute O
, O
the O
quality O
of O
teaching O
may O
be O
affected O

“ O
My O

been O
going O
to O

with O
supple O
teachers O

In O
the O
end O
, O
it O
is O
better O

” O

But O
does O
this O
mistrust O
arise O
from O
the O
lesson O
of O
sexual O
education O
? O

“ O
The O
speech O
is O
much O
wider O
. O

We O
, O
in O
the O
family O
, O
are O
not O
opposed O
to O
sex O
education O
lessons O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
. O

The O
point O
is O
that O
that O
lesson O
was O
taken O
without O
warning O
us O
. O

There O
have O
been O
too O
explicit O
terms O
used O
, O
which O
, O
in O
our O
opinion O
, O
are O
not O
good O
for O
a O
child O

This O
is O
not O
about O
being O
bigots O

I O

it O
is O

“ O

the O
problem O

Ceola B-PER

“ O
is O
that O

the O

Zuclo B-LOC

Ruggero B-PER

The O
man O
was O
accused O
of O
violating O
the O
rules O

following O
the O
slaughter O
of O
two O
specimens O

plan O
, O
during O
the O
first O
day O

in O
September O
2003 O

The O
judgment O
constitutes O
an O
important O
precedent O

somehow O
contributes O
to O
reassuring O
the O
presidents O

If O
the O

to O

the O
responsibility O
can O

The O
judge O
Carlo B-PER
Ancona I-PER
points O
out O
in O
the O
judgment O
that O
hunters O
can O
not O
be O
punished O
because O
they O
can O
not O
be O
informed O
in O
real O
time O
about O
the O
slaughter O

Similarly O
, O
the O
president O
can O
not O
be O
punished O

as O
he O
has O
no O
tools O

prevent O
the O

In O
the O

At O

Lorenzo B-PER

The O
path O
he O
was O
on O
with O
Debiasi B-PER
had O
a O
strong O
slope O
: O

Probably O
the O
man O
was O
imbalanced O
because O
of O
a O
root O
that O
sprang O
out O
of O
the O
ground O
and O
is O
rushed O
toward O
the O
valley O
, O
in O
the O
rhododendron O
forest O
, O
then O
ending O
against O
some O
shrubs O
. O

More O
than O
100 O
meters O
of O
fall O
, O
but O
the O
man O
has O
always O
remained O
conscious O
and O
quiet O

waiting O
for O
rescue O

“ O

It O

a O
very O

In O

No O

But O
, O
in O

, O
with O
the O
hope O
that O
the O

would O
exhaust O
the O

behind O
his O
back O
, O
that O
he O
would O
go O
home O

that O
it O
would O
then O
be O
possible O
to O
approve O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
- O
and O
the O
darkness O
can O
obscure O
even O
the O
most O
cruel O
misdeeds O
- O
the O
reform O

but O
above O
all O
the O
long O
- O
hardened O

of O

Here O
, O
Sergio B-PER

Duracell I-PER
is O
trying O
to O
block O
these O
two O

Contrary O
to O
the O
whole O

The O
two O

about O
two O

which O
the O
tireless O
Divine B-PER
discusses O
one O

repeated O
hundreds O

Sergio B-PER

five O

( O
other O
three O

Following O
the O
rejection O

he O
reiterated O
: O

Seven O

three O

With O
very O
few O

the O

in O

In O

to O
the O
host O
, O
i.e. O
the O

The O

be O
reviewed O
by O
the O
House B-ORG
on O
Monday O
, O
September O
13 O
. O

The O
Roman O
meeting O
is O
considered O
important O
, O
because O
it O
will O
be O
the O
opportunity O
to O
illustrate O
directly O
to O
Calderoli B-PER
the O
concerns O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
related O
to O
institutional O
reform O
. O

A O
reform O
that O
presents O
no O
few O
problematic O
aspects O
, O
starting O
with O
the O
system O
to O
be O
implemented O
in O
case O
the O
Parliament B-ORG
decides O
to O
change O
the O
statute O
of O
autonomy O
. O

The O
Constitution O
provides O
that O
the O
" O
Charter O
" O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
Alto I-LOC
Adige I-LOC
can O
be O
amended O
after O
double O
reading O
( O
i.e. O
, O
four O
votes O
in O
total O
) O
by O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
without O
the O
obligation O
to O
involve O
the O
regions O
to O
special O
status O
. O

Article O
33 O
of O
the O
draft O
constitutional O
law O
proposed O
by O
the O
centre O
- O
right O
states O
instead O
that O
the O
Statute O
can O
be O
amended O
" O
previously O
agreed O
" O
with O
the O
Regions O
concerned O
, O
but O
if O
this O
agreement O
is O
not O
reached O
within O
six O
months O
from O
the O
submission O
of O
the O
proposals O
, O
the O
Parliament B-ORG
can O
proceed O
to O
the O
amendments O
also O
with O
the O
opposing O
opinion O
of O
local O
realities O
. O

From O
Dellai B-PER
and O
Bezzi B-PER
, O
this O
hypothesis O
was O
fiercely O
opposed O
: O

The O
text O
– O
it O
was O
said O
– O
introduces O
“ O
a O
series O
of O
serious O
violations O
of O
the O
autonomy O
of O
special O
regions O
and O
autonomous O
provinces O
” O
. O

The O
presidents O
will O
then O
submit O
to O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
a O
five O
- O
point O
document O
, O
which O
proposes O
a O
series O
of O
amendments O
to O
the O
bill O
. O

Regarding O
the O
drafting O
of O
the O
new O
Statute O
, O
a O
strong O
involvement O
of O
the O
Regional O
Councils O
will O
be O
proposed O
, O
not O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
discussion O
in O
Parliament B-ORG
, O
but O
at O
a O
text O
approved O
in O
second O
reading O
by O
the O
Chambers O
. O

For O
the O
presidents O
, O
the O
final O
word O
must O
be O
given O
to O
the O
regional O
assemblies O
, O
contrary O
to O
what O
is O
now O
assumed O
by O
the O
reform O
. O

Another O
cause O
of O
concern O
is O
the O
forecast O
that O
elections O
for O
the O
renewal O
of O
all O
regional O
councils O
will O
be O
simultaneous O
with O
that O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
and O
be O
held O
by O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
. O

This O
– O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
presidents O
– O
would O
constitute O
“ O
a O
very O
strong O
injury O
to O
autonomy O
, O
because O
the O
discipline O
of O
the O
election O
of O
councils O
has O
always O
been O
a O
prerogative O
of O
regional O
laws O
and O
is O
guaranteed O
by O
the O
Statute O
as O
an O
essential O
element O
of O
specificity O
and O
autonomy O
” O
. O

Before O
meeting O
the O
presidents O
, O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
will O
meet O
with O
Leghista O
Sergio B-PER
Divina I-PER
. O

There O
is O
a O
friendship O
between O
the O
two O
who O
have O
been O
in O
the O
war B-ORG
for O
many O
years O
: O

The O
report O
was O
frequent O
in O
the O
last O
30th O
election O
campaign O
. O

The O
same O
Divina B-PER
will O
present O
a O
series O
of O
requests O
to O
Calderoli B-PER
, O
which O
curiously O
come O
very O
close O
to O
the O
proposals O
of O
the O
presidents O
of O
the O
regions O
. O

Among O
these O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
“ O
always O
” O
the O
favorable O
opinion O
of O
local O
realities O
before O
proceeding O
to O
statutory O
changes O
, O
as O
well O
as O
asking O
that O
any O
form O
of O
autonomy O
wider O
than O
today O
be O
extended O
not O
only O
to O
ordinary O
regions O
, O
but O
also O
to O
those O
with O
special O
status O
. O

Divine B-PER
does O
not O
hide O
hope O
to O
bring O
home O
a O
positive O
result O
: O

“ O
The O
proposals O
that O
I O
will O
present O
to O
the O
minister O
– O
he O
says O
– O
do O
not O
affect O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
reform O
law O
, O
but O
their O
acceptance O
could O
accredit O
the O
League B-ORG
as O
a O
force O
that O
respects O
autonomies O
, O
as O
well O
as O
change O
the O
political O
orientation O
of O
broad O
groups O
of O
population O
. O
” O

In O
a O
note O
, O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
Giacomo B-PER
Bezzi I-PER
hopes O
that O
“ O
concrete O
initiatives O
will O
follow O
the O
minutes O
of O
the O
minister O
’s O
commitments O

” O

In O
the O
same O
document O
, O
we O
recall O
the O
initiatives O
put O
in O
place O
in O
defense O
of O

starting O
from O

“ O
I O

of O
Vittorio B-PER
Emanuele I-PER
di I-PER
Savoia I-PER
on O
constitutional O
reforms O
at O
Parliament B-ORG

examination O
. O

As O
for O
the O
economic O
situation O
, O
the O
member O
of O
the O
royal O
house O
deposited O
and O
exiled O
( O
the O
ban O
on O
returning O
to O
Italy B-LOC
has O
just O
been O
removed O
) O
after O
the O
fall O
of O
fascism O
, O
appears O
optimistic O
: O

We O
have O
and O
will O
always O
have O
the O
star O
. O

There O
is O
no O
problem O
, O
we O
will O
be O
fine O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
euro O
has O
given O
a O
very O
strong O
shock O
to O
wages O
and O
prices O
, O
but O
maybe O
we O
had O
to O
see O
this O
thing O
first O
, O
which O
has O
happened O
anyway O
. O
” O

According O
to O
Vittorio B-PER
Emanuele I-PER
, O
his O
experience O
in O
this O
Italian O
period O
taught O
him O
to O
“ O
be O
close O
to O
the O
people O
and O
with O
the O
people O
” O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
king O
in O
the O
end O
is O
the O
representative O
of O
the O
people O
, O
” O
he O
concluded O
, O
hiding O
in O
the O
words O
a O
singular O

sixty O

The O
request O

Otherwise O

the O

More O

, O
officer O
of O
the O
Romanian O

at O
the O

of O
the O
Fiat O

. O

From O
1961 O
until O
last O
year O
, O
the O
competition O
has O
alwaysined O
worldwide O
validity O
. O

Not O
only O
, O
but O
in O
the O
1990s O
it O
was O
also O
valid O
for O
Italian O
. O

There O
was O
a O
rare O
spectacle O
to O
the O
public O
. O

It O
is O
the O
opportunity O
to O
admire O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
big O
iridates O
alongside O
the O
best O
drivers O
of O
the O

This O
year O
the O

was O
moved O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
’ve O
been O

what O
we O
’re O
going O

A O

, O
Saturday O
, O
and O
obviously O
shortened O

But O
the O
special O
historic O
ones O
remain O
, O
such O
as O
San O
Romolo O
, O
Monte O
Ceppo O
and O
Colle O
d'Oggia O
. O

For O
Renato B-PER
Travaglia I-PER
, O
reduced O
to O
the O
Adriatic O
, O
it O
is O
the O
last O
chance O
to O
bring O
his O
206 O
Super O
1600 O
to O
the O
podium O
. O

The O
bottom O
, O

, O
would O
be O
ideal O
for O
this O
car O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
the O
Ligure O
race O
has O
always O
given O
great O
satisfaction O
to O
the O
trentino O
driver O
. O

So O
, O
is O
there O
a O
feeling O
with O
the O
Sanremo O
? O
” O

In O
1993 O
, O
we O
won O
a O
magnificent O
7th O
absolute O
. O

First O
in O
Group O
N O
with O
the O
Ford O

Cosworth O

The O
competition O
was O
worldwide O
. O

A O
great O
satisfaction O
, O
as O
I O
then O
won O
my O
first O
scudetto O

” O

So O
, O
the O
start O
with O
the O
306 O
Maxi O

“ O
In O
1998 O
, O
we O
tried O
the O
306 O
Maxi O
, O
with O
which O
I O
would O
compete O
the O
following O
year O
in O
the O
tricolor O
. O

It O
was O
imperative O
to O
reach O
the O
end O
of O
the O
race O
and O
we O
finished O
third O
among O
the O
2RM O
. O

But O
we O
took O
away O
the O
great O
satisfaction O
of O
breaking O
off O
an O
absolute O
third O
time O
on O
the O
Pantasina O

we O
put O

” O

The O

still O

was O
forced O

“ O
We O

In O

that O

why O

The O
technicalists O
, O
on O

argued O
that O
the O
idea O

supported O
by O

who O
declared O
themselves O

the O

But O
what O
was O
less O
liked O
was O
the O
strong O
will O
of O
the O
president O

to O
want O
to O
cover O
the O

a O

without O

willing O
to O

“ O
We O
are O
convinced O
, O
” O
said O
Alessandra B-PER
Degasperi I-PER
, O
“ O
that O
the O
most O
serious O
closure O
is O
in O
the O
district O
council B-ORG
of O
Sardinia B-LOC

We O
believe O
that O
the O
constituency B-LOC
itself O
should O
carefully O
evaluate O
a O
serious O
rethinking O
of O
the O
matter O
and O
seek O
new O
, O
more O
satisfactory O
solutions O
because O
the O
road O
is O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
many O

. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
will O
urge O
the O
three O
councillors O
who O
have O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
confront O
us O
in O

assembly O
( O
B. B-PER
Berloffa I-PER
, O
G. B-PER
Zambelli I-PER

to O
ask O
the O

to O
put O
the O
matter O
on O
the O

as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
the O

. O
” O

In O
order O
to O
complete O
the O
framework O
, O
the O
promoters O
also O
spoke O
directly O
with O
the O

confirmed O
their O
readiness O

The O

Margherita B-ORG

Italy I-ORG

other O

Socialists O
are O
virtually O
gone O

And O
here O
is O
the O
autonomous O
current O
that O
is O
part O
of O
the O
local O
political O
genome O
. O

But O
I O
think O
the O
local O
center O
- O
left O
governments O
here O
have O
more O
institutional O
tenacity O
. O

Increased O
control O
of O
the O
administrative O
system O
. O

Per O
, O
in O
reality O
, O
one O
can O
talk O
about O
a O
greater O
tenure O
of O
the O
Trentino O
community O
, O
which O
has O
a O
higher O
level O
of O
solidarity O
and O
a O
better O
average O
rigour O
of O
relationship O

It O
is O
better O
here O

If O
the O
political O

somehow O
“ O
holds O

” O
can O
it O
hold O
that O
of O
the O
social O
state O
, O
of O
the O
overall O
level O
of O
services O
, O
given O
the O
attacks O
on O
the O
Trentino O
autonomy O
that O
come O
from O
Rome B-LOC

its O
“ O
anomal O

wealth O
in O

? O

The O
overall O
layout O
of O
the O
local O
welfare O
system O
, O
which O
includes O
all O
transfers O
( O
unemployment O
, O
poverty O
, O
disabled O
, O
healthcare O
, O
educational O
and O
educational O
services O
) O
, O
beyond O
a O
series O
of O
necessary O
adjustments O
, O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
it O
still O
works O
well O
. O

There O
are O
a O
number O
of O
aid O
bodies O
that O
come O
to O
the O
public O
. O

And O
yet O
the O
statistics O
Istat B-ORG
spoke O
of O
new O
poverty O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
it O
seemed O
that O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
the O
levels O
of O
poverty O
were O
increasing O
( O
which O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
) O
is O
because O
the O
consumption O
is O
low O
. O

But O
the O
thing O
depends O
on O
the O
privileged O
tariff O
system O
, O
due O
to O
the O
intervention O
of O
the O
public O
administration O
. O

Thirty O
- O
year O
- O
olds O
spend O
little O
on O
transportation O
, O
school O
and O
healthcare O
. O

The O
welfare O
system O
covers O
a O
range O
of O
services O
that O
are O
paid O
by O
citizens O
elsewhere O
. O

Think O
of O
the O
convenience O
of O
textbooks O
in O
compulsory O
schools O
, O
a O
great O
savings O
for O
families O
. O

The O
public O
tariffs O
. O

A O
half O
- O
revolution O
for O
the O
proposal O
to O
bring O
the O
bus O
ticket O
to O
Trento B-LOC
to O
one O
euro O
. O

( O
Smile O
to O
the O
scratch B-PER
) O

The O
Milan O
subway O
ticket O
costs O
more O
than O
one O
euro O
and O
is O
valid O
for O
less O
time O
. O

Here O
the O
provincial O
administration O
benefits O
from O
a O
public O
budget O
that O
is O
among O
the O
highest O
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O

The O
Lombardy B-LOC
Region I-LOC
and O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
of I-LOC
Milan I-LOC
are O
not O
poor O
entities O
. O

The O
public O
contribution O
to O
the O
budget O
per O
capita O
is O
significant O
. O

Then O
the O
question O
is O
: O

Is O
the O
public O
money O
invested O
properly O
? O

I O
feel O
that O
there O
is O
a O
very O
high O
level O
of O
legitimacy O
of O
the O
local O
administration O
that O
has O
demonstrated O
to O
administer O
in O
a O
careful O
manner O
. O

It O
is O
perfect O
. O

The O
Trentino B-LOC
should O
in O
this O
refer O
to O
Central O
and O
Northern O
Europe O
and O
not O
confront O
itself O
continuously O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
, O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
at O
any O
time O
, O
but O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
at O
any O
time O
. O

I O
say O
that O
compared O
to O
the O
Italian O
context O
, O
the O
overall O
system O
has O
strong O
points O
of O
legitimacy O
. O

I O
do O
not O
see O
any O
relevant O
examples O
of O
wasting O
public O
money O
. O

There O
are O
strong O
signs O
of O
blind O
use O
of O
public O
money O
. O

Autonomy O
is O
legitimate O
. O

Why O
go O
to O
Trentino B-LOC
? O

Instead O
, O
we O
see O
similar O
levels O
of O
autonomy O
developing O
in O
the O
national O
field O
. O

But O
that O
does O
n’t O
mean O
that O
people O
have O
to O
expect O
everything O
for O
free O
. O

In O
a O
situation O
of O
reduced O
economic O
development O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
public O
administration O
can O
not O
continue O
to O
support O
all O
the O
needs O
of O
each O
individual O
citizen O
. O

There O
is O
a O
need O
to O
demand O
a O
reduction O
of O
the O
facilities O
, O
proportionate O
to O
the O
economic O
capacity O
of O
households O
. O

The O
bus O
ticket O
from O
0.90 O
to O
1 O
euro O
has O
created O
fear O
and O
protests O
. O

and O
excessive O
. O

It O
is O
reasonable O
to O
try O
to O
raise O
the O
rates O
. O

It O
is O
better O
for O
the O
private O
sector O
to O
pay O
a O
little O
more O
than O
for O
the O
public O
sector O
. O

The O
generality O
of O
the O
thirty O
must O
realize O
that O
we O
are O
living O
in O
a O
less O
favourable O
economic O
situation O
than O
we O
were O
10 O
years O
ago O
. O

And O
some O
higher O
costs O
must O
be O
borne O
by O
the O
private O
sector O
if O
the O
public O
administration O
is O
to O
continue O
to O
be O
reasonably O
fair O
and O
efficient O
. O

After O
these O
statements O
of O
love O
, O
can O
you O
indicate O
any O
vices O
of O
the O
Trentino O
system O
? O

There O
are O
elements O
of O
widespread O
negativity O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

Thirty O
people O
love O
to O
affirm O
their O
diversity O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
. O

It O
would O
be O
time O
for O
them O
to O
start O
confronting O
Europe B-LOC
, O
with O
the O
best O
of O
Europe B-LOC
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
sometimes O
prefer O
a O
provincial O
- O
style O
defensive O
shutdown O
. O

The O
appeal O
to O
diversity O
must O
be O
propulsive O
and O
not O
defensive O
. O

But O
there O
is O
also O
another O
criticism O
, O
more O
specific O
, O
that O
can O
be O
done O
to O
the O
trenth O
reality O
. O

I O
am O
talking O
about O

Despite O
the O
efforts O
of O
the O

and O
despite O
the O
growing O
reputation O
of O
the O
Ateneo O

private O

This O
is O
what O
was O
communicated O
yesterday O
by O
the O
Minister O
of O
Reforms O
Roberto B-PER
Calderoli I-PER
to O
the O
summits O
of O
the O
Provinces B-LOC
and O
Special O
Regions O
, O
who O
arrived O
in O
Rome B-LOC
to O
demand O
institutional O
guarantees O
to O
the O
special O
autonomies O
. O

At O
the O
meeting O
were O
present O
the O
presidents O
of O
the O
provinces O
of O
Trento B-LOC
and O
Bolzano B-LOC
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
and O
Luis B-PER
Durnwalder I-PER
, O
the O
president O
of O
the O
regional B-ORG
council I-ORG
Mario B-PER
Magnani I-PER
, O
and O
of O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
Giacomo B-PER
Bezzi I-PER
. O

The O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
, O
although O
reiterating O
his O
personal O
conviction O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
positions O
of O
the O
special O
autonomies O
, O
opposed O
the O
no O
- O
dry O
majority O
to O
accept O
the O
demands O
. O

“ O
There O
is O
a O
majority O
agreement O
, O
and O
you O
ca O
n’t O
go O
back O
, O
” O
he O
told O
Trentino B-LOC
representatives O
. O

“ O
I O
am O
gathering O
all O
your O
requests O
and O
will O
bring O
them O
to O
the O
examination O
of O
the O
majority O
, O
but O
I O
can O
not O
make O
specific O
commitments O
on O
these O
points O
. O
” O

This O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O

“ O
It O
is O
paradoxical O
that O
a O
constitutional O
reform O
born O
for O
federalism O
risks O
reducing O
the O
autonomy O
that O
is O
already O
guaranteed O
to O
the O
Regions O
and O
Provinces O
under O
special O
status O
, O
” O
said O
President O
Dellai B-PER
, O
just O
leaving O
the O
summit O
with O
Calderoli B-PER
. O

“ O
This O
draft O
law O
radically O
affects O
the O
constitutional O
foundations O
of O
our O
systems O
. O

We O
ca O
n’t O
stand O
still O
and O
watch O
. O
” O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
note O
the O
comments O
made O
by O
the O
Chairman O
and O
Chairman O
of O
the O
Board O
. O

“ O
The O
meeting O
went O
badly O
, O
” O
the O
chairman O
said O
. O

And O
Magnani B-PER
added O
: O

They O
want O
to O
bring O
home O
the O
law O
on O
federalism O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
see O
much O
interest O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O
” O

It O
is O
the O
only O
point O
on O
which O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
has O
given O
reassurances O
is O
that O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
best O
favor O
clause O
" O
. O

The O
new O
reform O
on O
federalism O
will O
apply O
to O
special O
autonomies O
only O
if O
they O
are O
improving O
compared O
to O
what O
they O
already O
have O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this B-PER
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-LOC
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
could O
repeal O
laws O
of O
autonomy O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
national O
interest O
, O
which O
is O
quite O
a O
general O
concept O
. O

“ O
The O
Senate B-ORG
is O
a O
political O
body O
, O
” O
Dellai B-PER
said O
. O

“ O
This O
means O
that O
our O
laws O
will O
be O
judged O
by O
a O
political O
body O
. O
” O

The O
Minister O
Agrees O
, O
the O
Government O
No O
- O
The O
Minister O
has O
repeatedly O
assumed O
that O
, O
if O
it O
were O
for O
him O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
national O
interest O
would O
not O
even O
take O
it O
into O
account O
. O

“ O
But O
the O
majority O
agreement O
provides O
for O
it O
, O
” O
he O
added O
. O

“ O
And O
I O
can O
do O
nothing O
. O
” O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
the O
Senate O
has O
not O
given O
a O
clear O
answer O
. O

The O
demands O
of O
the O
autonomies O
were O
to O
have O
equal O
representation O
in O
the O
new O
Federal B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
. O

Calderoli B-PER
has O
postponed O
everything O
to O
a O
new O
model O
that O
is O
being O
worked O
out O
, O
and O
the O
contours O
of O
which O
are O
not O

but O
of O

municipal B-ORG
council I-ORG
does O
in O
a O
year O
. O

It O
is O
unthinkable O
. O

The O
meeting B-ORG
has O
been O
extended O
until O
next O
Wednesday O
. O

There O
is O
also O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
possible O
pact O
with O
Raoul B-PER
Pontalti I-PER
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
. O

This O
variant O
has O
so O
far O
not O
indicated O
any O
alternative O
. O

Andreatta B-PER
recently O
declared O
her O
inclination O
to O
re O
- O
propose O
the O
former O
Camparta B-LOC
farm O
, O
which O
in O
the O
past O
had O
been O
discarded O
because O
too O
decentralized O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
find O
a O
solution O
for O
the O
problem O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
solution O
for O
the O
problem O
. O

It O
is O
still O
to O
be O
understood O
whether O
there O
are O
margins O
for O
negotiation O
with O
Leghista O
Giuseppe B-PER
Filippin I-PER
. O

Yesterday O
, O
the O
counselor O
tried O
several O
times O
to O
establish O
a O
contact O
. O

and O
unnecessary O
. O

He O
was O
stuck O
at O
his O
desk O
during O
the O
council O
and O
even O
sent O
him O
a O
small O
sms O
, O
suggesting O
a O
meeting O
for O
this O
afternoon O
. O

For O
the O
time O
being O
, O
however O
, O
Filippin B-PER
seems O
intended O
to O
hold O
hard O
: O

“ O
We O
are O
at O
the O
point O
of O
no O
return O
, O
” O
he O
says O
, O
“ O
and O
if O
I O
have O
to O
lose O
my O
face O
, O
I O
’d O
rather O
do O
it O
in O
the O
classroom O
. O
” O

The O
discussion O
proceeded O
with O
no O
surprise O
, O
but O
with O
a O
few O
surprises O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
, O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
provide O
a O
comprehensive O
and O
comprehensive O
approach O
to O
the O
development O
of O
our O
products O
and O
services O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
our O
products O
and O
services B-ORG
. O

His O
main O
fear O
is O
that O
, O
through O
the O
observations O
and O
amendments O
, O
the O
variant O
risks O
transforming O
itself O
to O
come O
to O
conclusions O
different O
from O
those O
foreseen O
. O

The O
autonomist O
Alberto B-PER
Pattini I-PER
praised O
the O
climate O
and O
spirit O
with O
which O
the O
urban B-ORG
planning I-ORG
committee I-ORG
has O
worked O
in O
these O
months O
on O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
variant O
and O
noted O
the O
excellent O
work O
done O
by O
the O
offices O
to O
put O
under O
protection O
a O
series O
of O
historical O
buildings O
of O
the O
early O
twentieth O
century O
architecturally O
notable O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
insisting O
on O
finding O
a O
different O
solution O
for O
the O
Steinerian O
school O
, O
the O
green O
Aldo B-PER
Pompermaier I-PER
has O
focused O
on O
areas O
for O
facilitated O
construction O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
. O

“ O
In O
Canova B-LOC
600 O
houses O
will O
be O
built O
, O
there O
was O
all O
the O
possibility O
of O
identifying O
fifty O
for O

. O
” O

Finally O
, O
Sergio B-PER
Cappelletti I-PER
, O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
pointed O
out O
some O
technical O
aspects O
hoping O
for O
the O
modification O
of O
the O
norm O
of O
the O
underfloors O
, O
removing O
the O
references O
to O
architectural O
coherence O
to O
leave O
full O
judgment O
to O
the O
building O
committee B-ORG

and O
declaring O
himself O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
acceptance O
of O
applications O
for O

of O

“ O
immediate O

” O
release O
of O
the O
Italian O

their O

They O
made O
it O
quite O
conscious O
that O
it O
would O
be O
immediately O
recalled O
by O
the O
numerous O

present O

It O
took O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
for O
the O
translation O

the O

also O
cited O

always O
to O
demonize O

A O
Polish O
citizen O
was O
struck O
around O
9 O

last O
night O
while O
crossing O
the O
road O
in O
tangential O
, O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
Opera O
Bonomelli O

The O
man O
was O
rescued O
by O
an O
ambulance O

taken O
to O
the O
hospital O

His O
condition O
immediately O
seemed O
serious O

In O
the O
shock O
, O
he O
a O
cranial O
trauma O
and O
other O
contusions O

Doctors O
have O
kept O
the O
prognosis O
, O
although O
they O
believe O
that O
the O
man O
is O
not O
in O
danger O
of O
life O

The O
man O
was O
crossing O
the O
tangential O
on O
foot O
probably O
to O
go O
to O
the O
nearby O
Opera O
Bonomelli O

He O
did O
not O
see O
a O
car O
coming O
from O
the O
north O

The O
shock O
was O
impossible O
to O
avoid O

In O
the O
car O
was O
a O

who O
could O
only O
see O
the O
man O
at O
the O
last O
moment O

Every O
attempt O
to O
brake O
was O
futile O

The O
car O
struck O
the O
Polish O
and O
drove O
him O
away O

Fortunately O
, O
the O
car O
had O
slowed O
down O
a O
lot O
before O
the O
crash O
, O
otherwise O
the O
consequences O
would O
have O
been O
heavier O

The O
woman O
told O
the O
city O
guards O
that O
she O
had O
not O
seen O
the O
man O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O

He O
was O
rescued O
by O
an O
ambulance O
that O
took O
him O

The O
man O
was O
treated O
by O

man O
was O
conscious O

is O
not O
in O
danger O

life O

However O
, O
its O
conditions O
do O
not O

Calderoli B-PER

merely O
accompanied O

Late O
in O
the O

the O

offered O

bring O
the O

She O
had O
accepted O
without O
suspecting O
the O
real O
intentions O

what O
a O
friend O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O

After O
the O

had O
thought O
about O
what O

uncertain O

what O
to O
do O

The O
right O
decision O
, O

file O

with O
the O

was O
made O
only O
after O
20 O

time O

that O

had O
never O
even O

of O
the O
violations O
and O
serious O
crimes O
it O
has O
spotted O
, O
bring O
the O
negotiation O
back O
to O
the O
center O
of O
the O
debate O
as O
the O
Chechen O
population O
demands O
. O

Terrorism O
is O
born O
in O
conditions O
of O
total O
despair O
and O
Putin B-PER
’s O
refusal O
to O
dialogue O
with O
the O
political O
component O
has O
strengthened O
the O
extremist O
band O
. O

But O
it O
also O
talks O
about O
the O
presence O
of O
Arabs O
and O
connections O
with O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
... O

There O
is O
a O
rhetoric O
of O
communication O
: O

We O
are O
waiting O
for O
confirmation O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
Arabs O
. O

And O
then O
it O
is O
not O
said O
that O
this O
means O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
involvement O
. O

I O
repeat O
: O

There O
are O
different O
terrorists O
with O
different O
purposes O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Iraq B-LOC
was O
attacked O
because O
of O
Bin B-PER
Laden I-PER
, O
but O
Saddam B-PER
had O
opposite O
interests O
to O
those O
of O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
. O

Thousands O
of O
miles O
away O
, O
what O
can O
sensitive O
citizens O
do O
to O
urge O
new O
approaches O
? O

Massacres O
like O
those O
of O
Beslan B-LOC
, O
but O
not O
only O
, O
can O
never O
be O
justified O
. O

That O
said O
, O
there O
must O
be O
a O
collective O
commitment O
to O
putting O
the O
rights O
, O
values O
and O
dignity O
of O
each O
population O
at O
the O
center O
of O
attention O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
, O
those O
who O
do O
n’t O
come O
in O
always O
die O
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
there O
is O
always O
someone O
willing O
to O
finance O
the O
disorder O
and O
from O
every O
conflict O
he O
tries O
to O
benefit O
: O

in O
Chechnya B-LOC
as O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
or O
the O
African O
region O
of O
the O
Great B-LOC
Lakes I-LOC
. O

Specifically O
, O
what O
should O
be O
done O
? O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
are O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
the O
law O
of O
the O
jungle O
and O
not O
of O
international O
law O
apply O
. O

That O
is O
why O
the O
Chechen O
question O
must O
be O
brought O
to O
the O
only O
common O
home O
of O
humanity O
, O
the O
UN O
. O

The O
United O
Nations B-ORG
, O
despite O
all O
the O
shortcomings O
they O
have O
, O
are O
not O
to O
be O
thrown O
away O
. O

The O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
must O
impose O
a O
mission O
that O
induces O
the O
Russian O
government O
to O
open O
up O
dialogue O
with O
the O
civilian O
authorities O
of O
Chechnya B-LOC
and O
not O
with O
the O
current O
puppet O
government O
son O
of O
ghost O
elections O
. O

The O
Iraq B-LOC
? O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
does O
not O
want O
to O
let O
go O
, O
but O
the O
reasoning O
is O
the O
same O
. O

Preventing O
is O
better O
than O
curing O
. O

We O
should O
not O
always O
respond O
to O
the O
various O
“ O
call O
to O
arms O
” O
but O
say O
enough O
to O
every O
form O
of O
violence O
. O

The O
European B-LOC
Union I-LOC
has O
called O
for O
“ O
explanations O
” O
for O
the O
Beslan B-LOC
massacre O
. O

The O
EU B-LOC
foreign O
ministry O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
did O
not O
speak O
personally O
. O

But O
if O
Europe B-LOC
goes O
backwards O
on O
this O
front O
, O
it O
would O
mean O
that O
it O
is O
too O
weak O
. O

Can O
peace O
win O
or O
not O
? O

He O
can O
win O
, O
otherwise O
the O
whole O

would O
end O
Ossetia B-LOC

He O

I O

It O

In O
the O

the O

these O

as O
we O

According O
to O

, O
the O

occurred O
while O
a O

block O

The O

There O
is O
no O

because O

even O

the O

Nichetti B-PER
, O
she O
is O
a O
highly O
regarded O
director O
who O
has O
been O
able O
to O
innovate O
Italian O
cinema O
. O

But O
he O
has O
no O
specific O
competence O
in O
alpinism O
. O

Why O
was O
he O
chosen O
as O
the O
director O
of O
the O
film O
festival O
? O

“ O
It O
is O
true O
. O

I O
am O
not O
an O
expert O
mountain O
climber O
, O
I O
have O
no O
specific O
skills O
. O

I O
said O
that O
when O
they O
contacted O
me O
last O
June O
14 O
. O

In O
the O
last O
edition O
I O
presided O
over O
the O
jury O
of O
the O
Film O
Festival O
and O
it O
was O
an O
extraordinary O
experience O
for O
me O
. O

I O
was O
part O
of O
the O
jury O
of O
other O
festivals O
, O
from O
Cannes B-LOC
to O
Montreal B-LOC
to O
Venice B-LOC
, O
but O
here O
in O
Trento B-LOC
it O
was O
something O
special O
. O

There O
was O
no O
political O
or O
film O
school O
clash O
between O
the O
jury O
members O
, O
but O
everyone O
loved O
the O
mountain O
deeply O
. O

Let O
’s O
see O
if O
I O
can O
give O
more O
visibility O
to O
the O
mountain O
capital O
Trento B-LOC
. O
” O

Although O
of O
quality O
, O
the O
Filmfestival O
has O
never O
found O
large O
spaces O
in O
the O
national O
media O
. O

and O
why O
? O

“ O
The O
Trento B-LOC
Festival O
is O
incredibly O
underestimated O
by O
the O
national O
media O
, O
both O
by O
the O
press O
and O
television O
. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
here O
in O
Italy B-LOC
who O
makes O
it O
known O
. O

It O
must O
definitely O
have O
a O
wider O
window O
, O
and O
for O
that O
I O
will O
commit O
myself O
. O

But O
beyond O
a O
few O
passages O
on O
national O
TV O
, O
we O
will O
bring O
the O
event O
online O
, O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
making O
it O
accessible O
to O
a O
very O
large O
audience O
, O
not O
just O
traditional O
fans O
. O
” O

The O
risk O
is O
sometimes O
that O
it O
is O
reduced O
to O
an O
industry O
festival O
, O
for O
a O
few O
professionals O
. O

“ O
This O
is O
a O
risk O
we O
need O
to O
avoid O
. O

For O
this O
, O
while O
safeguarding O
the O
style O
of O
the O
festival O
, O
we O
need O
to O
reach O
a O
wider O
audience O
, O
and O
a O
greater O
visibility O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
city O
. O

“ O
Last O
year O
, O
touring O
Trento B-LOC
, O
I O
had O
the O
perception O
that O
the O
festival O
was O
in O
a O
non O
- O
place O
, O
the O
city O
did O
n’t O
feel O
it O
as O
its O
own O
. O
” O

What O
projects O
do O
you O
have O
in O
mind O
? O

“ O
It O
is O
necessary O
that O
in O
the O
week O
of O
the O
festival O
the O
restaurants O
organize O
thematic O
initiatives O
, O
the O
schools O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
participate O
in O
the O
projections O
, O
the O
squares O
of O
Trento B-LOC
involve O
people O
at O
the O
Filmfestival O
. O

I O
think O
of O
a O
projection O
in O
Piazza B-LOC
Dante I-LOC
or O
in O
Piazza B-LOC
Battisti I-LOC
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
. O

complained O
about O
the O

Will O
he O
return O

“ O
For O
me O
, O
it O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
bring O
the O

inside O
the O

You O
can O
also O
bring O
them O
back O
to O

it O
must O
not O

the O
reasons O
for O
his O
resignation O
: O

“ O
For O
a O
complex O
set O
of O
reasons O
, O
including O
the O
awareness O
that O
I O
no O
longer O
get O
the O
full O
support O
that O
I O
felt O
necessary O
from O
the O
competent O
offices O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
leave O
my O
position O
as O
responsible O
director O
of O
Misna B-ORG
. O

I O
do O
not O
do O
it O
from O
time O
to O
time O
and O
, O
put O
aside O
any O
legitimate O
bitterness O
, O
I O
leave O
the O
signature O

Father O

recalled O

since O
Misna B-ORG
made O
its O
first O
experimental O
launch O
on O
December O
2 O
, O
1997 O
. O

Then O
our O
aim O
was O
to O
give O
voice O
to O
that O
part O
of O
the O
world O
that O
, O
though O
the O
largest O
, O
rarely O
finds O
the O
suitable O
spaces O
to O
talk O
about O
itself O
, O
to O
tell O
its O

, O
to O
make O
known O
unpublished O

The O

because O
when O

you O
have O
to O

In O

not O

Maraner B-PER

His O

was O
Trento O

I O
came O
from O
the O
Spring B-ORG
of O
Verona B-ORG
and O
it O
was O
a O
bet O
for O
me O
: O

I O
wanted O
to O
know O
if O
I O
was O
a O
footballer O
or O
not O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
to O
meet O
a O
coach O
like O
Cavasin B-PER
who O
gave O
me O
confidence O
by O
making O
me O
play O
as O
a O
holder O
and O
taught O
me O
a O
lot O

” O

And O
now O
again O
in O

from O
Pescantina B-LOC

Christian B-PER

just O

It O
was O
easy O
, O
I O
agree O

He O
may O
not O
remember O
having O
been O
warned O
before O

As O
I O
said O
, O
we O
are O
a O

we O
are O
all O

To O
enable O
such O

is O
the O

to O

of O

To O

The O
already O

confirmation O

The O
work O

technically O

difficult O

of O
the O

of O
the O
second O

, O
under O
the O
hands O
of O
this O

becomes O
not O
only O
understandable O

also O
stimulating O

In O
this O
performance O
were O
already O
found O
all O
the O
musical O
gifts O

Lucchesini B-PER
easily O
recognizable O
in O
the O
Chopin O
preludes O

The O
performance O

controversial O

Nothing O
to O

Lucchesini B-PER

control O
of O

his O

the O

the O

Kamenz B-PER
sparked O
in O
his O
appearances O
at O
the O

clamours O

“ O

the O
world O
, O
it O
is O
the O
first O
time O
in O
the O
world O
. O

But O
the O
postponement O
remains O
a O
sign O
of O
difficulty O
, O
which O
the O
rating O
agencies O
, O
which O
so O
far O
have O
awarded O
our O
Province B-LOC
, O
may O
not O
ignore O
in O
the O
judgment O
next O
year O
. O

For O
the O
first O
few O
months O
of O
the O
year O
, O
it O
will O
be O
limited O
to O
the O
ordinary O
administration O
. O

And O
more O
than O
one O
counselor O
had O
discouraged O
this O
choice O
. O

It O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
not O
only O
the O
times O
of O
Minister O
Siniscalco B-PER
and O
Berlusconi B-PER
in O
the O
postponement O
of O
Dellai B-PER
. O

In O
recent O
weeks O
, O
the O
president O
has O
confronted O
his O
junta B-ORG
, O
showed O
accounts O
and O
forecasts O
and O
called O
for O
a O
responsible O
attitude O
. O

He O
then O
sent O
a O
letter O
- O
it O
is O
these O
days O
- O
to O
each O
adviser O
in O
which O
he O
essentially O
asks O
each O
of O
them O
to O
indicate O
the O
priorities O
and O
above O
all O
what O
and O
how O
much O
- O
as O
a O
percentage O
- O
he O
is O
willing O
to O
cut O
compared O
to O
his O
2004 O
budget O
, O
expressing O
the O
need O
to O
reach O
a O
reduction O
- O
trapela O
- O
even O
3 O
% O
overall O
. O

The O
President O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
for O
the O
policy O
that O
this O
center O
- O
left O
government O
has O
given O
itself O
, O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
cut O
on O
the O
social O
state O
, O
in O
particular O
on O
healthcare O
, O
nor O
on O
the O
social O
- O
care O
sector O
, O
although O
many O
of O
the O
announced O
purposes O
and O
on O
research O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
be O
reduced O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
Dellai B-PER
wants O
to O
respect O
the O
“ O
stability O
pact O
” O
with O
the O
state O
and O
not O
be O
degraded O
by O
the O
rating O
agencies O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
orientation O
that O
is O
emerging O
is O
that O
the O
sectors O
that O
will O
have O
to O
sacrifice O
the O
most O
will O
be O
: O

Culture O
, O
public O
works O
and O
economic O
sectors O
. O

In O
short O
, O
there O
will O
be O
fewer O
resources O
for O
museums O
, O
gangs O
and O
associations O
, O
to O
create O
roads O
, O
sports O
buildings O
and O
firearms O
in O
every O
corner O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
but O
also O
fewer O
contributions O
and O
initiatives O
to O
support O
economic O
activities O
. O

It O
will O
try O
to O
“ O
re O
- O
adjust O
” O
the O
commitment O
represented O
by O
territorial O
pacts O
, O
which O
are O
sucking O
up O
a O
lot O
of O
resources O
. O

This O
is O
just O
to O
name O
some O
of O
the O
most O
“ O
risk O
” O
items O
. O

For O
Dellai B-PER
this O
manoeuvre O
is O
not O
only O
the O
forecast O
budget O
for O
2005 O
, O
but O
will O
have O
to O
represent O
, O
as O
he O
calls O
it O
, O
a O
“ O
legislature O
budget O
” O
, O
which O
means O
the O
drawing O
of O
what O
his O
government O
can O
afford O
to O
do O
or O
not O
do O
in O
the O
remaining O
four O
years O
, O
well O
aware O
that O
the O
financial O
trend O
of O
the O
legislature O
, O
according O
to O
the O
forecasts O
, O
in O
the O
worst O
of O
hypotheses O
can O
reach O
up O
to O
a O
“ O
less O
8 O
% O
” O
of O
the O
2004 O
budget O
. O

Looking O
from O
the O
perspective O
, O
Dellai B-PER
is O
trying O
to O
find O
the O
widest O
sharing O
- O
including O
economic O
and O
social O
categories O
- O
on O
the O
priorities O
that O
his O
government O
will O
decide O
to O
give O
itself O
. O

This O
is O
why O
much O
is O
expected O
from O

Purin B-PER

points O

We O

is O
the O
most O

“ O
We O
have O
long O
since O

a O
letter O
to O

asking O
for O
additional O
resources O
on O

We O
did O

” O

The O

reason O
for O

But O
that O
is O

According O
to O

the O

As O

5 O
to O
2 O
makes O
full O
merit O
to O
the O
superiority O
of O
the O
boys O
of O
Ron B-PER
Ivany I-PER
who O
dominated O
despite O
the O
heavy O
absence O
of O
captain O
Margoni B-PER
. O

It O
is O
the O
first O
part O
of O
the O
game O
that O
is O
especially O
spectacular O
and O
intense O
, O
with O
the O
hosts O
putting O
on O
the O
ice O
a O
physical O
freshness O
at O
least O
unexpected O
for O
this O
stage O
of O
the O
tournament O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
a O
very O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
the O
human B-PER
body I-PER
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
a O
very O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
the O
human B-PER
body I-PER
. O

The O
advantage O
is O
not O
placing O
the O
souls O
of O
the O
ladines O
but O
the O
pusteresians O
are O
skilled O
and O
fortunate O
to O
exploit O
the O
first O
numerical O
superiority O
. O

With O
Bjorklund B-PER
in O
« O
bench O
punished O
» O
, O
the O
Bassa B-PER
pasticcia O
and O
Pichler B-PER
returns O
in O
equality O
the O
match O
. O

At O
this O
point O
the O
host O
team O
could O
reorganize O
but O
has O
no O
time O
because O
the O
draw O
lasts O
the O
parenthesis O
of O
only O
12 O
seconds O
, O
after O
which O
Rochefort O
thinks O
to O
bring O
the O
trentine O
formation O
forward O
. O

At O
this O
point O
the O
Fassa B-PER
insists O
on O
the O
offensive O
outputs O
continuing O
to O
express O
a O
fluid O
and O
orderly O
manoeuvre O
, O
especially O
with O
the O
first O
line O
of O
attack O
formed O
by O
Felicetti B-PER
, O
Rochefort B-PER
and O
the O
Canadian O
Rymsha B-PER
. O

It O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
the O
American O
attacker O
at O
17’39 O
finds O
himself O
alone O
in O
front O
of O
Baur B-PER
and O
freezes O
him O
relentlessly O
. O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
year O
, O
the O
company O
will O
be O
able O
to O
provide O
a O
full O
range O
of O
services O
and O
services O
. O

In O
the O
second O
half O
the O
two O
teams O
showed O
themselves O
strangely O
timid O
and O
nervous O
. O

The O
goal O
was O
scored O
by O
Mc B-PER
Nevin I-PER
in O
the O
fourth O
. O

In O
the O
second O
half O
, O
the O
two O
fronts O
of O

are O
only O
controlled O

the O

According O
to O
medical O
analyses O
, O
the O
man O
of O
ice O
was O
surely O
killed O
by O
a O
arrow O
that O
hit O
him O
in O
the O
back O
. O

Who O
was O
this O
man O
who O
carried O
a O
copper O
tail O
and O
why O
he O
was O
killed O
, O
were O
the O
two O
questions O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
debate O
. O

He O
was O
a O
man O
of O
rank O
. O

He O
carried O
an O
object O
reserved O
for O
the O
highest O
class O
, O
a O
copper O
ax O
. O

In O
his O
hands O
he O
held O
a O
fist O
, O
and O
his O
body O
showed O
obvious O
signs O
of O
colluttering O
. O

The O
most O
recent O
hypotheses O
speak O
of O
a O
shepherd O
, O
murdered O
for O
his O
flocks O
. O

“ O
But O
if O
that O
was O
the O
case O
, O
” O
Tecchiati B-PER
explained O
, O
“ O
why O
did O
n’t O
they O
steal O
his O
tail O
, O
an O
object O
of O
enormous O
value O
at O
the O
time O
? O

“ O
The O

Another O
hypothesis O
speaks O
of O
a O
shaman O
, O
a O
man O
of O
religion O
who O
would O
have O
immolated O
himself O
for O
his O
people O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
explained O
, O
even O
in O
this O
case O
, O
the O
weapons O
he O
was O
equipped O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
and O
the O
blow O
to O
the O
back O
. O

In O
archaeologically O
documented O
cases O
of O
human O
sacrifices O
, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
ritual O
killing O
, O
with O
a O
arrow O
trapped O
behind O
from O
a O
considerable O
distance O
at O
a O
speed O
of O
about O
140 O
km O
. O

According O
to O
Tecchiati B-PER
, O
he O
was O
a O
high O
- O
ranking O
man O
, O
a O
survivor O
, O
as O
in O
an O
era O
when O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
reach O
thirty O
, O
Oetzi B-PER
died O
murdered O
at O
the O
age O
of O
over O
40 O
. O

The O
poor O
loss O
of O
the O
bones O
of O
the O
joints O
denotes O
a O
life O
free O
of O
physical O
stress O
, O
therefore O
excludes O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
the O
shepherd O
. O

The O
tattoos O
on O
the O
body O
are O
not O
proof O
of O
belonging O
to O
a O
specific O
caste O
like O
that O
of O
the O
shamans O
, O
because O
the O
most O
plausible O
explanation O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
that O
taumaturgic O
magic O
, O
reserved O
to O
a O
particular O
man O
, O
but O
not O
necessarily O
to O
a O
man O
of O
religion O

The O
mystery O
of O
Ötzi B-PER

, O

exactly O
a O

capable O
of O

– O
as O
an O
intolerable O
confrontation O
and O
a O
deadly O
danger O
, O
has O
forgotten O
a O
couple O
of O
cosettes O
. O

The O
first O
is O
that O
, O
among O
the O
many O
powers O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
and O
its O
advisors O
, O
there O
is O
not O
to O
prevent O
an O
enterprise O
from O
doing O
its O
own O
business O
, O
and O
to O
do O
it O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
if O
it O
believes O
that O
it O
can O
do O
it O
with O
profit O
. O

Whether O
it O
’s O
based O
in O
Shanghai B-LOC
or O
Bolzano I-LOC
, O
it O
does O
n’t O
matter O
. O

The O
interference O
of O
a O
politician O
and O
an O
administrator O
in O
market O
affairs O
is O
, O
yes O
, O
intolerable O
. O

Unless O
the O
conviction O
of O
conflict O
of O
interest O
only O
applies O
to O
some O
and O
not O
others O
. O

The O
second O
thing O
that O
has O
forgotten O
Grisenti B-PER
is O
that O
today O
it O
is O
still O
a O
bit O
late O
to O
go O
down O
the O
field O
. O

“ O
We O
are O
not O
land O
of O
conquest O
, O
” O
he O
tweeted O
. O

Honestly O
, O
nobody O
had O
noticed O
it O
. O

And O
nobody O
, O
probably O
, O
will O
believe O
it O
, O
after O
, O
one O
after O
another O
, O
the O
largest O
thirty O
banks O
have O
fallen O
under O
the O
control O
of O
large O
national O
groups O
. O

The O
war O
against O
conquest O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
fought O
, O
possibly O
, O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
, O
however O
, O
the O
rich O
surplus O
- O
values O
earned O
by O
those O
who O
sold O
the O
control O
shares O
of O
our O
banks O
made O
the O
babau O
of O
colonization O
less O
frightening O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
, O
now O
, O
to O
take O
it O
with O
those O
who O
have O
resisted O
those O
temptations O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
we O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
take O
part O
in O
a O
series O
of O
events O
, O
which O
will O
take O
place O
in O
the O
first O
half O

the O
year O

will O
take O
place O
in O
the O
second O
half O

year O
. O

What O
will O
he O
do O
, O
Grisenti B-PER
, O
when O
Sparkasse B-ORG
opens O
his O
thirties O
? O

The O
third O
thing O
that O
the O
counselor O
has O
forgotten O
is O
that O
the O
last O
judges O
of O
the O
credit O
challenge O
will O
be O
consumers O

who O
may O
decide O
to O
transfer O

Amistadi B-PER
, O
the O
father O
of O
the O
bill O
, O
observes O
: O

“ O
I O
’m O
not O
sure O
I O
have O
to O
tell O
the O
president O
or O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
group O
how O
to O
make O
the O
agenda O
, O
but O
I O
’m O
not O
hiding O
the O
concern O
that O
the O
discussion O
about O
allowances O
and O
vitalities O
of O
the O
councillors O
will O
go O
on O
for O
a O
long O
time O
because O
many O
do O
not O
share O
the O
proposed O
reform O
Magnani O
– O
Svp O
. O

I O
myself O
- O
reveals O
Amistadi B-PER
- O
do O
not O
find O
it O
correct O
because O
it O
guarantees O
those O
who O
have O
already O
had O
, O
while O
penalizing O
us O
new O

I O
do O
n’t O
like O
it O

but O
I O
’ll O
vote O
for O
it O
just O
for O
party O
discipline O

” O

The O
local O
counselor O
believes O
that O
there O
is O
a O
real O
risk O
that O
the O
municipal O
law O
will O
not O
be O
passed O
in O
time O
for O
the O
spring O
municipal O
elections O
and O
is O
concerned O
that O
his O
work O
will O
prove O
useless O

“ O
I O
am O
here O
and O
I O
am O
here O
, O
” O
Amistadi B-PER
says O
, O
“ O
just O
to O
get O
the O
approval O
of O
this O
law O

” O

Amistadi B-PER
has O
given O
himself O
this O
mission O
and O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
goal O
is O
to O
arrive O
on O
time O
for O
these O
municipal O
elections O
, O
since O
the O
law O
provides O
for O
some O
significant O
changes O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
his O
term O
of O
office O
as O
a O
counselor O
lasts O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O

will O
have O

something O
that O
becomes O
a O
true O
and O
sincere O
friendship O
, O
with O
ups O
and O
downs O
like O
all O
long O
friendships O
a O
nice O
piece O
of O
life O
. O

Friendship O
means O
spending O
afternoons O
and O
evenings O
and O
nights O
together O
reading O
and O
studying O
and O
discussing O
, O
but O
she O
talks O
more O
and O
more O
because O
she O
knows O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
and O
is O
really O
able O
to O
fascinate O
and O
engage O
. O

Friendship O
means O
studying O
, O
but O
also O
making O
some O
laughter O
and O
some O
walks O
on O
the O
lake B-LOC
of I-LOC
Garda I-LOC
, O
or O
going O
to O
mushrooms O
there O
, O
in O
Val B-LOC
di I-LOC
Sole I-LOC
, O
in O
Cusiano B-LOC
. O

He O
laughs O
, O
“ O
I O
am O
thirty O
” O
with O
his O
unmistakable O
Tuscany O
accent O
. O

The O
dominant O
is O
the O
study O
. O

It O
was O
a O
beautiful O
school O
. O

Because O
she O
, O
Mary B-PER
, O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
talk O
about O
difficult O
and O
serious O
and O
challenging O
things O
with O
the O
lightness O
of O
curiosity O
, O
the O
accuracy O
of O
analysis O
and O
criticism O
, O
the O
accuracy O
of O
judgment O
. O

But O
talking O
about O
it O
now O
costs O
pain O
and O
hardship O
. O

Thus O
, O
although O
in O
the O
background O
there O
is O
the O
gallery O
of O
authors O
of O
literature O
and O
there O
is O
a O
long O
theory O
of O
critics O
and O
there O
is O
the O
passion O
and O
enthusiasm O
of O
her O
, O
of O
Mary B-PER
today O
dominates O
the O
ultimate O
image O
, O
that O
of O
the O
long O
suffering O
, O
of O
the O
ever O
greater O
and O
harder O
fatigue O
of O
living O
. O

Mary B-PER
continues O
to O
struggle O
and O
devour O
books O
, O
obsessively O
, O
as O
if O
exorcising O
the O
problem O
of O
life O
that O
goes O
away O
, O
and O
the O
problem O
of O
death O
that O
this O
time O
is O
not O
written O
on O
a O
text O
of O
literature O
but O
that O
is O
planted O
within O
your O
body O
and O
devours O
you O
. O

It O
is O
not O
understood O
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
be O
saints O
like O
Francis B-PER
to O
say O
“ O
Laudato O
si O
’ O
, O
mi O
’ O
Signore B-PER
, O
for O
our O
sister O
death O
” O
. O

Ordinary O
people O
experience O
, O
it O
is O
inevitable O
, O
loss O
when O
they O
strike O
“ O
the O
last O
line O
of O
things O
, O
” O
beyond O
which O
“ O
we O
are O
dust O
and O
shadow O
. O
” O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
understand O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
, O
besides O
the O
loss O
of O
those O
who O
are O
left O
, O
there O
are O
also O
reasons O
for O
consolation O
. O

They O
will O
also O
be O
little O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
loss O
, O
but O
at O
least O
there O
are O
. O

In O
the O
hardness O
of O
the O
detachment O
you O
can O
finally O
see O
it O
serene O
and O
large O
and O
no O
longer O
corrupt O
: O

It O
is O
no O
longer O
burdened O
by O
suffering O
and O
illness O
. O

And O
then O
she O
stayed O
at O
home O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
her O
things O
and O
her O
books O
and O
the O
environment O
of O
her O
life O
. O

With O
the O
Duomo O
out O
of O
the O
window O
and O
the O
hours O
beating O
, O
difficult O
especially O
in O
the O
infinite O
and O
overwhelming O
length O
of O
the O
night O
. O

It O
will O
be O
difficult O
and O
it O
will O
be O
little O
, O
but O
one O
can O
think O
and O
hope O
that O
Mary B-PER
is O
happy O
that O
she O
has O
been O
accompanied O
so O
beyond O
the O
last O
line O
of O
things O
. O

And O
we O
can O
only O
add O
, O
parafrasing O
an O
ancient O
poet O
, O
that O
" O
if O
some O
sweetness O
can O
reach O
the O
graves O
moved O
by O
our O
pain O
, O
by O
that O
sense O
of O
loss O
in O
which O
we O
keep O
alive O
the O
affections O
that O
have O
dissolved O
in O
fear O
, O
surely O
death O
will O
not O
give O
it O
a O
greater O
and O
stronger O
pain O
than O
the O
joy O
that O
comes O
to O
it O
from O
our O
love O
. O

To O
give O

in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
to O
the O

, O
for O
a O
more O

and O
focused O
on O
the O
fate O
of O
about O
90 O
employees O
of O
the O
French O
multinational O

, O
which O
turned O
to O
an O

, O
to O
identify O
an O

also O
taking O

called O

impact O
of O

But O
beyond O
the O

, O
the O

“ O
The O
tendency O
to O
relocate O
, O
especially O
for O
companies O
in O
the O

– O
says O
in O
this O
regard O
the O
provincial O
secretary O
of O
Uil B-ORG
, O
Ermanno B-PER
Monari I-PER
– O
is O
a O
need O
more O

, O
and O
often O
constitutes O
the O
only O
way O
to O
remain O
competitive O
. O

The O
relocalization O
, O
therefore O
, O
must O
not O
be O
demonized O

, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
governed O

” O

To O
this O
, O
Monari B-PER
explains O
, O
“ O

it O
requires O
a O
great O
effort O

is O
the O
naked O

cruel O
news O
: O

that O
last O
winter O
, O
in O
case O
of O
exceeding O

the O

, O
were O
stopped O
this O
year O

be O
allowed O

. O

This O
is O
the O
clarification O
of O
the O
APPA B-ORG
after O
the O
different O
communication O
made O
yesterday O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meetings O
between O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
technical O
and O
municipalities O
. O

Therefore O
, O
only O
the O
Euro O

be O
forced O
to O
stand O
still O
. O

Maybe O
not O
even O
those O
. O

Or O
at O
least O
not O
all O
. O

In O
the O
program O
agreement O
that O
the O
Province B-LOC
presented O
yesterday O
, O
as O
a O
basis O
for O
discussion O
in O
anticipation O
of O
putting O
together O
the O
observations O
that O
will O
come O
next O
week O
from O
the O
municipalities O
, O
it O
is O
in O
fact O
hypothesized O
the O
possibility O
of O
granting O
a O
derogation O
from O
circulation O
( O
from O
1 O
November O
2005 O
) O
to O
vehicle O
owners O
who O
undertake O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
to O
replace O
their O
" O
old O
wheels O
" O
with O
less O
polluting O
means O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
if O
the O
owner O
of O
a O
non O
- O
catalyzed O
gasoline O
car O
or O
a O
Euro O
0 O
diesel O
signed O
a O
kind O
of O
contract O
with O
the O
Province B-LOC
in O
which O
they O
formalized O
their O
intention O
to O
replace O
within O
the O
expiration O
of O
the O
three O
- O
year O
plan O
their O
polluting O
medium O
, O
they O
would O
receive O
a O
kind O
of O
safeguard O
to O
be O
able O
to O
travel O
at O
any O
time O
of O
the O
year O
( O
and O
especially O
with O
any O
weather O
conditions O
) O
on O
roads O
that O
would O
otherwise O
be O
for O
them O
off O
limits O
. O

The O
proposal O
, O
already O
attractive O
enough O
for O
many O
, O
could O
even O
prove O
unavoidable O
if O
it O
passed O
the O
line O
of O
some O
municipalities O
that O
- O
according O
to O
indiscretions O
- O
would O
already O
have O
formulated O
to O
the O
counselor O
the O
intention O
to O
request O
that O
the O
derogation O
be O
activated O
already O
from O
this O
winter O
. O

For O
his O
part O
, O
the O
counselor O
Gilmozzi B-PER
is O
cautious O
. O

This O
is O
a O
delicate O
matter O
and O
risks O
a O
lot O
. O

“ O
First O
and O
foremost O
, O
it O
must O
be O
stated O
that O
this O
is O
a O
proposal O
. O

It O
will O
have O
to O
be O
discussed O
with O
all O
municipalities O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
exemptions O
, O
it O
will O
then O
be O
the O
individual O
administrations O
to O
decide O
to O
whom O
to O
issue O
the O
traffic O
permit O
despite O
the O
blockages O
, O
not O
the O
province B-LOC
. O
” O

The O
risk O
, O
easily O
intuitive O
, O
is O
that O
if O
the O
municipalities O
were O
to O
be O
rather O
indulgence O
in O
granting O
exemptions O
, O
very O
few O
polluting O
vehicles O
would O
remain O
standing O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
adviser O
Gilmozzi B-PER
informs O
that O
the O
way O
to O
the O
old O
- O
generation O
diesel O
and O
gasoline O
blocks O
( O
two O
days O
a O
week O
) O
should O
start O
from O
November O
15 O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
get O
to O
know O
what O
we O
’re O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
. O

“ O
It O
would O
only O
create O
confusion O
, O
” O
says O
Gilmozzi B-PER
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
program O
agreement O
between O
municipalities O
and O
the O
Province B-LOC
sets O
out O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
central O
administration O
to O
define O
within O
180 O
days O
the O
operational O
lines O
for O
the O
enhancement O
of O
the O

that O
, O
instead O
, O
according O
to O
the O

Office I-ORG
- O
yesterday O
was O
heard O
Simonetta B-PER
's O
former O
employer O
, O
Salvatore B-PER
Volponi I-PER
- O
could O
be O
connected O
to O
each O
other O
by O
a O
red O
thread O
. O

A O
thread O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
identity O
of O
Simonetta B-PER
’s O
killer O
, O
a O
man O
she O
knew O
well O
and O
with O
whom O
she O
might O
even O
have O
had O
a O
sentimental O
“ O
liason O
” O
. O

But O
there O
is O
more O
: O

The O
PM O
may O
decide O
to O
question O
in O
the O
coming O
weeks O
the O
old O
or O
new O
protagonists O
of O
the O
yellow O
and O
then O
focus O
again O
on O
the O
condominium O
of O
the O
mysteries O
. O

The O
idea O
that O
actually O
opens O
a O
new O
chapter O
of O
the O
story O
comes O
from O
a O
book O
not O
yet O
published O
, O
written O
by O
the O
former O
employer O
of O
Cesaroni B-PER
, O
Salvatore B-PER
Volponi I-PER
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we B-PER
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
get O
to O
know O
what O
we O
’re O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
. O

“ O
I O
know O
that O
Simonetta B-PER
had O
intertwined O
a O
recent O
relationship O
with O
a O
man O
, O
” O
said O
the O
witness O
who O
was O
accompanied O
at O
Piazzale O
Clodio O
by O
her O
lawyer O
, O
lawyer O
Maria B-PER
Antonietta I-PER
Lamazza I-PER
. O

In O
order O
to O
make O
plausible O
the O
version O
of O
Volponi B-PER
- O
which O
in O
the O
book O
« O
I O
, O
Smonetta O
and O
Via O
Pomma O
» O
also O
tells O
the O
personal O
story O
of O
a O
man O
destroyed O
precisely O
by O
the O
incident O
- O
is O
a O
writing O
of O
the O
same O
Simonetta B-PER
Cesaroni I-PER
who O
was O
reviewed O
with O
other O
eyes O
by O
PM O
Cavallone B-PER
. O

Some O
verses O
of O
a O
song O
by O
Lucio B-PER
Dalla I-PER
kept O
in O
the O
bag O
would O
make O
you O
think O
of O
a O
particular O
emotional O
situation O
of O
the O
girl O
, O
coming O
out O
of O
a O
long O
love O
story O
and O
about O
to O
start O
another O
. O

“ O
And O
why O
should O
I O
regret O
, O
” O
Simonetta B-PER
writes O
on O
a O
sheet O
found O
in O
the O
bag O
along O
with O
the O
box O
of O
contraceptives O
, O
“ O
to O
play O
with O
life O
, O
to O
take O
it O
by O
the O
tail O
? O

So O
much O
will O
end O
one O
day O
, O
so O
much O
for O
eternity O
I O
have O
already O
thought O
of O
it O
. O

Eternal O
is O
also O
a O
minute O
, O
every O
kiss O
I O
receive O
from O
people O
I O
have O
loved O
. O
” O

But O
it O
is O
from O
DNA O
analysis O
on O
blood O
traces O
, O
to O
the O
examination O
of O
the O
Carabinieri O
del O
Ris B-ORG
and O
whose O
results O
will O
be O
known O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
month O
, O
that O
may O
come O
the O
turn O
. O

If O
it O
is O
evidenced O
that O
the O
DNA O
is O
compatible O
with O
that O
of O
Simonetta B-PER
or O
also O
compatible O
with O
that O
of O
a O
third O
person O
( O
the O
killer O
? O
) O
, O
the O
yellow O
of O
Via B-LOC
Pomma I-LOC
could O
approach O
the O
solution O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
get O
to O
know O
what O
we O
’re O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
. O

It O
could O
indicate O
that O
the O
murderer O
was O
there O
. O

And O
yet O
he O
escaped O
, O
climbing O
the O
elevator O
from O
the O
third O
floor O
( O
traces O
of O
blood O
were O
also O
found O
in O
the O
cabin O
) O
, O
then O
came O
out O
from O
a O
door O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
loft O
and O
leads O
to O
the O
garage O
. O

Someone O
who O
knew O
the O

well O
. O

Finally O

is O
not O
because O
of O
the O

just O
because O
of O
the O

the O

It O

carefully O

be O
even O

I O
follow O

But O
at O
almost O
60 O
years O

with O

it O
is O
permissible O

that O
if O
a O
young O

given O
a O

beyond O
the O

it O
is O
right O

if O

The O
logic O

this O

exactly O
what O

A O
more O

than O
rare O
measure O

arranged O
quickly O

furiously O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
an O
elementary O
consideration O

If O
the O

allow O
her O
to O
notice O
that O
she O
has O
struck O
a O

it O
means O
that O

The O

That O
day O
a O

On O
his O
six O

were O
still O
the O
unmistakable O
signs O
of O
the O
accident O

The O
woman O
justified O
herself O
by O
claiming O
she O
had O
not O
noticed O
anything O

However O
, O
this O
did O
not O
prevent O
the O
initiation O

the O
suspension O

This O
decision O
was O
challenged O

appeal O

accepted O

these O

For O

it O
was O
not O

to O

A O
story O
of O
rivalry O

Between O
these O
peoples O
and O
the O
Russians O
there O
has O
always O
been O
a O
more O
or O
less O
strong O
rivalry O

But O
in O
the O
early O
1800s O
the O
situation O
degenerated O
into O
war O
as O
Russia B-LOC
attempted O
to O
expand O
into O
the O
Indian B-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
. O

The O
Caucasians O
resisted O
for O
several O
years O

From O
1820 O
to O
1859 O

In O
1830 O
, O
an O

The O

were O
some O
North O

the O

Here O

the O
distant O
origin O

to O
the O
difference O
of O

the O

an O
unforgivable O
fault O
, O
which O
the O
Ossetians O
carry O
on O
to O
this O
day O

” O

But O
the O
real O
tragedy O
of O
the O
peoples O
of O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
was O
Stalinist O
Russia B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
17th O
, O
taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
confusion O
of O
the O
Russian O
revolution O
, O
the O
peoples O
of O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
attempted O
the O
road O
to O
independence O
: O

“ O
Russia B-LOC

been O
severely O
repressed O

” O

All O
the O

recaptured O

During O
World O
War O
II O
, O
when O
Hitler B-PER
invaded O
Russia B-LOC

the O
Chechens O
hoped O
for O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Stalinist O
regime O
and O
supported O
the O
invasion O
of O
the O
Nazis O
. O

This O
was O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
Stalin B-PER
was O
ruthless O
. O

The O
deportation O
of O
1944 O
. O

“ O
Stalin B-PER
, O
as O
a O
good O
Georgian O
, O
had O
a O
special O
attitude O
toward O
those O
who O
, O
from O
his O
point O

were O
just O
mountain O
rocks O
– O
says O
Bensi B-PER
– O
deportation O
to O
Siberia B-LOC
was O
organized O
from O
1944 O
onwards O

For O
transportation O
they O
used O
cargo O

where O
men O

women O

children O
ended O
up O

many O
died O
already O
during O
the O
journey O

In O
total O
, O
1,600,000 O
were O
killed O
, O
including O
at O

600,000 O
Chechens O

The O
survivors O
could O
only O
return O
home O
after O
the O
20th O
Congress O

the O
Communist B-ORG
Party I-ORG

where O
Nikita B-PER
Khrushchev I-PER
in O
1956 O
denounced O
Stalin B-PER

guilt O
. O

Almost O
all O
current O
Chechen O
leaders O
were O
born O
during O
deportation O
: O

This O
may O
explain O
the O
anger O
that O
lives O
in O
Chechnya B-LOC

In O
1993 O
, O
after O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Berlin B-LOC
Wall O
, O
the O
only O
general O
of O

origin O
managed O
to O
enter O

In O

the O

The O

a O
chronicle O
of O

In O
1996 O
the O
First O

with O
a O
semi O

a O
Russian O
promise O

revise O
the O

“ O
It O
never O

Here O
was O
the O
birth O

which O
blasted O

But O
there O
’s O
one O
thing O
that O
ca O
n’t O
be O
explained O
without O
looking O
back O
: O

Why O
the O
University O

“ O
It O
is O
not O
entirely O
coincidental O
. O

Some O
say O
that O
the O
terrorists O
chose O
it O
because O
they O
found O
officials O
to O
corrupt O
. O

But O
it O
is O
located O
in O
Ossetia B-LOC

precisely O
in O
a O
disputed O
area O
after O
the O
end O
of O

arose O
during O
the O

During O

But O
the O
lethal O
humus O
, O
to O
cause O
terrorism O
, O
where O
was O
it O
? O

At O
some O
point O
the O
Chechens O
remembered O
that O
they O
were O
Muslims O

Already O
during O
Gorbachev B-PER

era O
they O
made O
contacts O
with O
Islamic O

in O

with O
the O

But O
Chechen O

is O
deeply O
instrumental O

President O

said O
: O
“ O
I O
am O
a O

I O

Russia B-LOC

failure O

The O
economic O

at O

“ O
The O

In O
addition O
to O
historical O
considerations O

one O
should O
look O
at O
economics O

“ O
All O

there O

to O

that O

who O
will O
act O
autonomously O
, O
ensuring O
support O
, O
programs O
and O

. O

The O
birth O
of O
this O
new O

becoming O
an O

The O
questions O
underlying O
the O
debate O
were O
these O
: O

What O
kind O
of O
trends O
reveal O
community O
television O
for O
the O
evolution O
of O
television O
and O
communication O
in O
general O
? O

After O
considering O
television O
for O
decades O
as O
a O
factor O
of O
homologation O
and O
globalization O
, O
are O
we O
facing O
a O
rediscovery O
of O
a O
“ O
local O
” O
dimension O
of O
communication O
? O

The O
roundtable O
began O
with O
the O
communication O
of O
Massimo B-PER
Arvat I-PER
who O
brought O
his O
experience O
as O
a O
community O
television O
producer O
to O
Piemonte B-LOC
. O

There O
the O
local O
communities O
managed O
to O
create O
a O
" O
popular O
" O
network O
- O
born O
first O
with O
simple O
citizens O
, O
then O
by O
environmental O
associations O
and O
then O
by O
a O
diverse O
group O
of O
associations O
and O
spontaneous O
groups O
- O
giving O
rise O
to O
a O
daily O
programming O
of O
half O
an O
hour O
that O
was O
also O
broadcast O
by O
provincial O
TVs O
. O

The O
model O
was O
concretized O
in O
a O
talk O
show O
that O
dealt O
with O
issues O
related O
to O
the O
territory O
and O
was O
carried O
out O
in O
a O
public O
place O
. O

“ O
Television O
, O
” O
the O
producer O
said O
, O
“ O
is O
a O
tool O
that O
must O
serve O
first O
and O
foremost O
to O
communicate O
people O
. O

People O
who O
are O
different O
but O
who O
through O
the O
community O
television O
create O
communities O
. O
” O

This B-PER
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
study O
. O

From O
his O
beginnings O
that O
saw O
him O
as O
the O
artist O
of O
mass O
communication O
, O
to O
the O
attempt O
of O
decentralization O
in O
the O
1970s O
( O
with O
the O
birth O
and O
then O
death O
of O
the O
regional O
headquarters O
of O
Rai B-ORG
) O
, O
to O
the O
scenarios O
of O
tomorrow O
’s O
TV O
that O
will O
no O
longer O
be O
articulated O
into O
channels O
but O
at O
all O
managed O
by O
links O
. O

The O
trend O
will O
then O
be O
that O
of O
a O
universal O
coverage O
television O
that O
lives O
through O
universal O
production O
. O

“ O
These O
networks O
, O
” O
Melodia B-PER
concluded O
, O
“ O
will O
have O
as O
much O
longer O
life O
as O
they O
know O
how O
to O
interact O
with O
each O
other O
. O
” O

Marco B-PER

of O
his O
experience O
as O

scholar O
of O

– O
those O
that O
elsewhere O
are O
called O

many O
effectively O

These O
are O
very O
interesting O
experiences O
but O
often O
have O
a O
short O
life O
and O
end O
with O
a O
great O
dissipation O
of O
energies O
. O

“ O

Nolli B-PER

Laura B-PER

about O
her O

in O
the O

of O
contemporary O

scenarios O
. O

According O
to O
the O
scholar O
, O
community O

can O
be O
important O
experiences O
if O

with O
the O
other O
similar O
experiences O
distributed O
around O

In O

it O
is O
important O
to O

, O
an O

in O

– O
is O
an O
important O
signal O
: O

It O
is O
the O
demonstration O
that O
when O

want O
to O
collaborate O
they O
can O
make O
meaningful O
interventions O
in O
extremely O
fast O
time O
. O
” O

The O
budget O
of O
the O
operation O
is O
in O

because O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
total O
expenditure O
not O
unnecessary O
, O
were O
saved O
all O
the O
costs O
that O

have O
entailed O
the O

“ O
We O

The O

“ O
We O

The O
Pope O
on O
Communism O
: O

“ O
It O
was O
a O
necessary O
evil O
. O
” O

Communism O
was O
in O
some O
way O
a O
necessary O
evil O
to O
the O
world O
and O
man O
. O

This O
is O
stated O
by O
John B-PER
Paul I-PER
II I-PER
in O
his O
latest O
book O
, O
entitled O
“ O
Memory O
and O
Identity O
” O
, O
which O
was O
presented O
yesterday O
at O
the O
International O
Book O
Fair O
in O
Frankfurt O
. O

In O
the O
first O
post O
- O
war O
period O
, O
the O
Pope O
says O
in O
this O
volume O
that O
examines O
the O
great O
problems O
of O
modernity O
and O
answers O
the O
deepest O
questions O
of O
man O
, O
“ O
it O
was O
immediately O
clear O
that O
this O
( O
communism O
) O
would O
last O
for O
a O
much O
longer O
time O
than O
that O
of O
the O
Nazis O
. O

What O
was O
made O
to O
think O
was O
that O
that O
evil O
was O
in O
some O
way O
necessary O
to O
the O
world O
and O
to O
man O
” O
, O
writes O
the O
Pope O
, O
noting O
that O
“ O
in O
certain O
concrete O
situations O
of O
human O
existence O
, O
evil O
turns O
out O
to O
some O
extent O
useful O
in O
so O
far O
as O
it O
creates O
opportunities O
for O
good O
. O
” O

Quoting O
Goethe B-PER
’s O
Faust O
, O
the O
Holy O
Father O
recalls O
how O
the O
devil O
can O
also O
be O
defined O
as O
“ O
a O
part O
of O
that O
force O
that O
always O
wants O
evil O
but O
always O
does O
good O
. O
” O

As O
for O
Nazism O
, O
the O
Holy O
Father O
clarifies O
that O
at O
the O
time O
“ O
the O
real O
dimension O
of O
evil O
that O
prevailed O
in O
Europe B-LOC
was O
not O
perceived O
by O
everyone O
, O
even O
by O
those O
like O
us O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
center O
of O
that O
vortex O
” O
, O
admitting O
that O
“ O
for O
a O
long O
time O
the O
West O
did O
not O
want O
to O
believe O
in O
the O
extermination O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

Not O
even O
in O
Poland B-LOC
was O
known O
everything O
about O
what O
the O
Nazis O
had O
done O
and O
did O
to O
the O
Poles O
. O
” O

And O
it O
will O
probably O
be O
precisely O
“ O
the O
search O
for O
roots O
and O
seeds O
of O
good O
even O
in O
the O
worst O
manifestations O
of O
evil O
” O
, O
starting O
with O
Nazism O
, O
the O
aspect O
that O
will O
most O
discuss O
the O
new O
book O
of O
the O
Pope O

" O

There O
is O
only O
one O
way O

it O
is O
the O

” O

This O
year O
, O
there O
’s O
another O
reason O
to O
run O
. O

The O
anti O

influenza O
also O
protects O
against O
the O

of O

( O

, O
in O
the O
misguided O
hypothesis O
that O

a O
threat O

Through O
the O
campaign O
: O

This O
year O
, O
the B-ORG
company B-ORG
has O
announced O
that O
it O
will O
be O
able O
to O
provide O
information O
to O
persuade O
people O
over O
65 O
years O
of O
age O
to O
get O
vaccinated O
. O

“ O
Our O
commitment O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
major O
diseases O
are O
addressed O
in O
a O
general O
context O
of O
health O

, O
” O
says O
Andreolli B-PER
, O
“ O
For O

the O
goal O
to O
be O
achieved O
is O
to O
protect O
70 O
% O
of O
the O
elderly O
population O

” O

The O
Healthcare B-ORG
Company I-ORG
has O
purchased O
70,000 O
doses O
of O
the O
vaccine O
and O
invested O
33,500 O
euros O
for O
information O
. O

“ O
In O
Trentino B-LOC
the O
membership O
is O
good O
, O
last O
year O
we O
vaccinated O
64,000 O
people O
, O
that O
is O
, O
just O
under O
60 O

” O

Carraro I-PER
, O

But O
it O
’s O
not O
enough O
, O
we O
need O
to O
vaccinate O
more O
older O
people O
and O
also O
more O

under O

The O

over O
the O

take O
place O
in O

First O
, O
from O

to O
23 O
October O
, O
however O
, O
people O
born O
in O
1934 O
and O
1935 O
will O
be O
vaccinated O
, O
to O
whom O
by O
letter O
will O
also O
be O
offered O
free O
vaccination O
against O
pneumonia O
and O
other O
invasive O
pneumococcal O
diseases O
. O

Vaccinations O
are O
carried O
out O
in O
public O
hygiene O
clinics O
of O
the O
health O
district O

Each O
district O
will O
inform O
with O
warnings O
on O
which O
days O
and O
at O
what O
times O
the O
vaccinations O
will O
be O
carried O
out O
. O

There O
is O
time O
until O
the O
end O
of O
November O
. O

The O
Family O
Doctors O
: O

The O
real O
novelty O
of O
this O
year O
is O
that O
vaccination O
can O
also O
be O
performed O
by O
the O
family O
doctor O
. O

“ O
It O
starts O
with O
some O
doctors O
who O
have O
given O
their O
availability O
– O
explains O
Fabio B-PER
Branz I-PER
, O
president O
of O
the O
Order B-ORG
of I-ORG
Doctors I-ORG
– O
but O
already O
next O
year O
this O
activity O
of O
vaccination O
of O
assistants O
will O
become O
systematic O
. O
” O

The O
family O
doctors O
provided O
vaccination O
at O
home O
for O
patients O
who O
were O
unable O
to O
move O
. O

With O
the O
new O
agreements O
, O
it O
will O
try O
to O
make O
vaccination O
of O
people O
at O
risk O
one O
of O
the O
treatments O
that O
the O
family O
doctor O
routinely O
carries O
out O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
it O
is O
hoped O
to O
give O
further O
impetus O
to O
vaccination O
activity O
: O

The O
patient O
relying O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
his O
doctor O
will O
have O
more O
ease O
, O
but O
also O
more O
convenience O
, O
to O
adhere O
to O
. O

Since O
1996 O
, O
the O
number O
of O
over O
65 O
vaccinated O
against O
the O
flu O
has O
doubled O
, O
from O
32,286 O
to O
63,360 O
in O
2003 O
. O

But O
there O
are O
also O
10,000 O
thirty O
who O
, O
although O
not O
considered O
at O
risk O
, O
do O
not O
want O
to O
know O
about O
taking O
the O
flu O
and O
buy O
the O
vaccine O
at O
the O
pharmacy O
. O

The O
information O
: O

It O
is O
entrusted O
to O
1,500 O
lodges O
and O
70,000 O
folders O
distributed O
in O
hospitals O
, O
outpatients O
, O
pharmacies O
, O
bars O
, O
rest O
homes O
and O
parishes O
. O

Another O
2,000 O
large O
posters O
will O
be O
affixed O
in O
the O
municipalities O
, O
while O
10 O
giant O
posters O
( O
18 O
square O
meters O
) O
will O
appear O
in O

which O
in O

not O

In O
the O

that O

has O
put O
him O
out O

is O
just O
waiting O
for O
the O
opportunity O

roles O
of O

who O
today O
is O
in O

because O
, O
after O
the O
Itas B-ORG
took O
the O
Slovak O

he O
was O
invited O
to O
look O

“ O
Yes O

” O
says O
Gianluca B-PER
, O
“ O
but O
a O
training O
that O
is O
of O
my O

This O
has O
been O
the O
only O
condition O
I O
have O
placed O
on O
the O

since O
I O
have O
not O

In O
the O
first O
half O

that O

you O
decided O
not O
to O
go O
down O

the O
A2 B-ORG

“ O
No O

it O

to O
see O
the O
conditions O
guaranteed O
by O
the O
current O
contract O
with O

fulfilled O

it O

all O

” O

And O
yet O
Corigliano B-ORG
had O
officially O
announced O
your O
purchase O

It O
seemed O
like O
a O
happy O
choice O
, O
a O
puppy O
who O
returns O
home O
in O
search O
of O

“ O
The O
company O
was O
really O
reluctant O
to O
communicate O
that O
the O
operation O
had O
gone O
well O
. O

I O
had O
told O
the O
president O
from O
the O
beginning O
that O
even O
if O
he O
had O
reached O
an O
agreement O
with O
Trento B-ORG

the O
last O

would O
be O

still O
has O
to O

If O
I O
have O
to O
go O
down O
to O
the O
A2 B-ORG

I O
would O
like O
to O
do O
so O
for O
an O
ambitious O
club O

” O

Did O
you O
get O
any O
offers O
from O
abroad O
? O

“ O
A O
Japanese O
prosecutor O
went O
forward O
and O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
repeat O
the O
adventure O
in O
a O
team O
from O
that O
country O
. O

I O
immediately O
gave O
my O
readiness O
, O
but O
then O
nothing O
was O
done O
because O
each O
club O
had O
already O
chosen O

Did O
Pinto B-PER

who O
has O
always O
been O
a O
fan O
of O
you O

ask O
you O
not O
to O

Three O
years O

the O
experience O
went O
well O

You O
performed O
very O
well O
as O
a O
crusher O
and O
in O
Trento B-LOC
you O
were O
also O
awarded O
the O
MVP O
award O

“ O
It O
was O
the O
best O

played O
since O
the O
injury O

But O
after O
that O

the O

failed O

we O
lost O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
monthly O

we O
owe O

Today O
they O
have O
a O
good O
team O

they O
do O

have O
the O
resources O

invest O
on O
the O

” O

Let O

go O
back O

to O
be O
the O
right O

play O
the O
opposite O

again O
without O
much O
pressure O

What O
happened O
instead O
? O

“ O
Well O
, O
ignoring O
the O
shoulder O
injury O
that O
kept O
me O
standing O
for O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
, O
it O
happened O
that O
I O
played O
very O
little O
. O

To O
always O
stay O
on O
the O
bench O
is O
penalizing O
, O
because O
if O
you O
do O
n’t O
have O
the O
habit O
of O
playing O
with O
teammates O
, O
if O
you O
do O

have O
certain O

you O

would O

Almost O

A O
work O
of O

that O
the O

not O

It O
is O

explains O
the O

a O

And O
this O

another O

the O

which O
really O

The O

the O

that O

The O
Pope O

But O
I O

“ O

Martino B-PER

that O

Finally O
, O
the O
Cardinal O

Michele B-PER
Giordano I-PER
, O
calls O
for O
“ O

it O

that O
this O

the O
most O

It O
is O
not O

The O

only O

In O
this O

the O

“ O
The O
big O
problem O
we O
have O
is O
the O

says O

Unfortunately O
, O
until O
there O
is O
a O
complete O
restructuring O
of O
the O
first O

within O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
, O
there O
is O
no O
solution O
. O

Then O
it O
will O
be O
something O
else O
. O
” O

Meanwhile O
, O
we O
are O
trying O
to O
streamline O
accesses O
, O
including O
by O
agreeing O
new O
procedures O
with O
the O
primary O
of O
118 B-ORG
for O

As O
for O
the O
administrative O
part O
, O
the O
entrustment O
of O
this O
activity O
to O
the O
hostess O
goes O
to O
meet O
a O
request O
advanced O
precisely O
from O
the O
nurses O
, O
and O
that O
has O
seen O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
director O
of O
the O
hospital O
Baldantoni B-PER
. O

“ O
The O
big O
result O
we O
think O
we O
will O
get O
is O
the O
extra O
time O
that O
the O

will O
be O
able O
to O
devote O
to O
patients O
who O
are O
waiting O

be O
seen O

” O
concludes O
Torboli B-PER

We O
will O
be O
able O
to O
anticipate O
some O
procedures O
and O
patient O
delivery O
times O
. O

The O
recurrence O
will O
be O
good O
, O
both O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
nurse O

work O
and O
for O
the O
patient O
who O
will O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
be O
re O

checked O
and O
will O
see O
improvement O
in O
the O
quality O
of O

while O
waiting O

” O

A O
further O
step O
will O
see O
the O
assignment O
of O
some O

to O
follow O

“ O
The O

this O
is O
the O
title O
of O
the O

that O
will O
last O
until O

which O
was O
promoted O
by O

of O

in O
collaboration O
with O
the O

“ O
The O
intention O
of O
this O
conference O
– O
said O
Renzo B-PER
De I-PER
Stefani I-PER
, O
head O
of O
the O
mental B-ORG
health I-ORG
service I-ORG
– O
is O
to O
create O
a O
reserved O
and O
protected O
space O
, O
where O
for O
once O
the O
walls O
erected O
between O
operators O
and O
patients O
fall O
. O

It O
wants O
to O
be O
the O
key O
to O
ensuring O
that O
everyone O
can O
learn O
from O
everyone O
, O
so O
that O
everyone O
is O
aware O
of O
making O
a O
positive O
contribution O
to O
collaborating O
in O
building O
something O
. O
” O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
week O
, O
the O
participants O
were O
given O
a O
chance O
to O
experience O
mental O
illness O
. O

This O
year O
also O
Ron B-PER
Coleman I-PER
, O
author O
of O
the O
book O
“ O
Healing O
from O
Mental O
Evil O
” O
and O
a O
manual O
for O
“ O
hearing O
voices O
” O
. O

He O
also O
told O
about O
his O
experience O
as O
a O
sick O
man O
, O
left O
largely O
to O
himself O
and O
to O
the O
drugs O
. O

Coleman B-PER
pointed O
out O
that O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
feel O
better O
the O
patient O
needs O
to O
talk O
, O
to O
be O
listened O
to O
, O
to O
find O
an O
attentive O
interlocutor O
who O
has O
the O
patience O
to O
pay O
attention O
. O

Many O
patients O
were O
present O
who O
wanted O
to O
bring O
their O
experience O
to O
share O
it O
with O
others O
. O

From O
their O
stories O
emerged O
a O
situation O
of O
profound O
initial O
discomfort O
not O
always O
happens O
, O
many O
of O
them O
have O
claimed O
to O
have O
been O
in O
treatment O
for O
over O
twenty O
years O
without O
being O
able O
to O
any O
improvement O
. O

Everyone O
agreed O
to O
say O
that O
they O
had O
found O
the O
desire O
to O
“ O
fight O
” O
again O
and O
to O
feel O
like O
real O
people O
thanks O
to O
the O
help O
of O
self O
- O
help O
groups O
. O

“ O
They O
have O
managed O
to O
give O
a O
meaning O
to O
my O
time O
, O
to O
animate O
my O
days O
, O
to O
give O
order O
to O
my O
life O
, O
to O
give O
a O
reason O
to O
my O
actions O
, O
to O
find O
the O
affection O
and O
love O
that O
I O
had O
denied O
myself O
. O
” O

There O
is O
also O
great O
interest O
among O
the O
operators O
, O
among O
them O

“ O
Patients O
with O
severe O
personality O
disorders O
and O
schizophrenia O
are O
increasing O
, O
because O
our O
societies O
are O
increasingly O
individualist O
and O
there O
is O
never O
time O
to O
listen O
to O
anyone O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
only O
33 O
% O
of O
cases O
can O
be O
cured O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
working O
with O
this O
type O
of O
patients O
is O
important O
to O
listen O
and O
try O
to O
get O
involved O
in O
them O
, O
in O
their O
problems O
. O
” O

Today O
will O
be O
considered O
the O
chapter O
of O
“ O

there O
will O

Prodi B-PER
said O

Negotiations O

which O
are O
expected O

last O
for O
many O

by O
the O
fact O
that O

despite O
the O
undeniable O
progress O
made O

has O
explained O
Prodi B-PER
first O
to O

Prodi B-PER
spoke O
of O
“ O
shadow O

” O
that O

to O
be O
cleared O

called O
the O
conditions O
“ O
obvious O
precautions O

Among O
the O
precautions O

the O

Turkey B-LOC
will O
not O
join O
the O
EU B-LOC

And O
among O
the O
precautions O
is O
the O
introduction O

The O

“ O
The O

In O
a O

“ O
the O

How O
are O
these O
robots O
? O

First O
of O
all O
, O
they O
have O
no O
human O
facts O
, O
they O
resemble O
industrial O
machines O
and O
their O
behavior O
does O
not O
tend O
to O
reproduce O
that O
of O
man O
. O

They O
continue O
in O
their O
ability O
to O
coordinate O
, O
in O
their O
mechanism O
to O
respond O
to O
stimuli O
as O
programmed O
. O

Yet O
these O
rumbling O
and O
noisy O
creatures O
seem O
to O
submit O
to O
their O
condition O
of O
perpetual O
movement O
, O
they O
seem O
to O
be O
forced O
to O
support O
the O
dance O
, O
a O
terrifying O
dance O
that O
, O
citing O
Arnd B-PER
Wesemann I-PER
, O
“ O

to O
the O
dead O

” O

A O

shaken O

spasmodic O
movements O

It O
moves O
independently O
triggered O
by O
commands O
whose O
origin O
, O
meaning O
, O
and O
end O
are O
unknown O
to O

On O

Two O

side O
, O
even O
on O
other O

. O

Is O
this O
all O
intentional O
or O
is O
it O
purposeless O
? O

With O
Demers B-PER
fails O
any O
attempt O
to O
attribute O
to O
the O
actors O
- O
robots O
an O
intentionality O
and O
above O
all O
the O
behavior O
of O
machines O
remains O
for O
us O
indescriptible O
because O
it O
is O
not O
assimilable O
to O
that O
of O
humans O
. O

Each O
machine O
has O
its O
own O
task O
to O
perform O

According O

the O

But O
who O
was O
it O
? O

Certainly O
– O
said O
the O
expert O
– O
he O
was O
a O
man O

rank O
: O

He O
carried O
an O
object O
reserved O
for O
the O

class O
, O
a O
copper O

In O

The O
most O

“ O
But O
if O
that O
was O
the O
case O

” O
Tecchiati B-PER
explained O
, O
“ O
why O
did O

they O
steal O
his O

an O

“ O
The O

Another O
hypothesis O
speaks O
of O
a O
shaman O

a O
man O
of O
religion O
who O
would O
have O
immolated O
himself O
for O
his O

but O
it O
is O
not O
explained O

even O
in O
this O
case O
, O
the O
weapons O
he O
was O
equipped O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
and O
the O
blow O
to O
the O
back O

According O
to O
Tecchiati B-PER
, O
he O
was O
a O
high O
- O
ranking O
man O
, O
a O
survivor O
, O
as O
in O
an O
era O
when O
it O

The O
poor O

of O
the O
bones O
of O
the O

denotes O
a O

free O

his O

to O

that O
destroyed O

gave O
him O
a O

It O
happened O
in O
the O
division O
of O
Pediatric O
Oncomatology O
of O
the O
Policlinico O
“ O
San O
Matteo O
” O
in O
Pavia B-LOC
and O
in O
a O
way O
that O
has O
all O
the O
characteristics O
of O
the O
scientific O
enterprise O
, O
because O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O

had O
been O

, O
at O
the O
“ O

of O
the O

in O
Milan B-LOC
. O

A O
event O
that O
has O
been O
called O
“ O
historic O
” O
by O
the O
Minister O
of O
Health O
, O
Girolamo B-PER
Sirchia I-PER
, O
because O
it O
opens O
the O
door O
to O
the O
study O
of O
clinical O
use O
, O
also O
in O
adults O
, O
of O
treated O
stem O

, O
amplifying O
their O
number O
, O
to O
have O
greater O
certainty O
of O
the O
impact O
. O

Let O
us O
summarize O
the O
story O
. O

Prof. O
Franco B-PER
Locatelli I-PER
, O
director O
of O
the O
division O
, O
received O
a O
couple O
of O
parents O
in O
his O
studio O
last O
November O
. O

They O
live O
in O
a O
Lombardy B-LOC
municipality O
, O
are O
healthy O
carriers O
of O
Thalassemia O
Mayor O
and O
their O
child O
, O
Luca B-PER
, O
five O
years O
old O
, O
is O
thalassemic O
. O

But O
the O
parents O
, O
knowing O
they O
have O
3 O
out O
of O
4 O
chances O
that O
the O
next O
child O
is O
healthy O
, O
decided O
to O
try O
again O
: O

The O
woman O
is O
pregnant O
in O
the O
fourth O
month O
. O

She O
is O
expecting O
two O
twins O
, O
perfectly O
healthy O
. O

The O
couple O
’s O
question O
– O
which O
was O
obviously O
addressed O
to O
Pavia B-LOC
by O
a O
well O
- O
informed O
family O
doctor O
– O
is O
hopeful O
: O

Can O
the O
twins O
that O
are O
about O
to O
be O
born O
help O
the O
younger O
brother O
? O

Locatelli B-PER
knows O
this O
well O
. O

As O
healthy O
and O
compatible O
with O
the O
little O
Luca B-PER
, O
the O
two O
twins O
are O
employable O
for O
a O
stem O
cell O
transplant O
. O

They O
are O
born O
in O
April O
, O
at O
the O
Obstetric O
Gynecological O
Clinic O
of O
St. O
Matthew O
and O
at O
the O
time O
of O
birth O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
two O
umbilical O
cords O
is O
frozen O
and O
put O
aside O
. O

But O
at O
a O
first O
examination O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
one O
is O
rich O
in O
stem O
cells O
, O
the O
other O
is O
poor O
in O
them O
. O

For O
Locatelli B-PER
this O
is O
the O
right O
opportunity O
not O
to O
limit O
yourself O
to O
a O
transplant O
with O
the O
unit O
rich O
in O
stem O
, O
but O
to O
use O
the O
other O
( O
also O
compatible O
) O
, O
after O
having O
undergone O
the O
amplification O
of O
the O
number O
of O
stem O
. O

" O
In O
this O
way O
- O
specified O
the O
doctor O
pavese O
- O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
verify O
, O
through O
appropriate O
molecular O
investigations O
, O
the O
contribution O
of O
both O
the O
placental O
chains O
, O
those O
of O
the O
unit O
rich O
in O
stem O
cells O
but O
also O
that O
of O
the O
poorer O
unit O
, O
whose O
stem O
cells O
have O
grown O
in O
number O
in O
vitro O
. O

And O
for O
the O
first O
time O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
even O
in O
vitro O
expanded O
units O
can O
contribute O
to O
stem O
cell O
tinning O
, O
then O
diversify O
to O
form O
healthy O
red O
blood O
cells O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
double O
transplant O
, O
which O
took O
place O
on O
August O
12 O
, O
after O
the O
number O
of O
stem O
cords O
of O
the O
poorest O
cord O
in O
15 O
days O
had O
been O
increased O
by O
60 O
times O
at O
the O
“ O
Cell O
Factory O
” O
of O
the O
Policlinico O
of O
Milan B-LOC
directed O
by O
Paolo B-PER
Rebulla I-PER
, O
had O
the O
hoped O
outcome O
: O

As O
early O
as O
16 O
days O
after O
the O
operation O
, O
Luca B-PER
had O
white O
blood O
cell O
values O
that O
were O
widely O
protective O
from O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
( O
high O
in O
these O
cases O
) O
and O
two O
days O
later O
the O
first O
signs O
of O
a O
“ O
significant O
production O
of O
healthy O
red O
blood O

” O
were O
documented O
. O

The O
two O

I O
would O
like O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
discussion O

these O

regarding O
the O
confirmation O
or O
not O
of O
the O
current O
Director O

General O
of O

Provincial B-ORG
Health I-ORG
Company I-ORG

I O
live O
in O
Trento B-LOC
and O
work O
within O
the O
healthcare B-ORG
company I-ORG
. O

As O
Trentino O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
the O
best O
services O
from O
the O
best O
health O
professionals O
, O
available O
24 O
hours O
a O
day O
; O

I O
would O
like O
these O
Services O
to O
be O
available O
, O
both O
for O
emergencies O
and O
for O
planned O
interventions O
, O
at O
the O
time O
I O
deem O
appropriate O
; O

I O
would O
like O
the O
maximum O
availability O
of O
spirit O
and O
time O
of O
all O
health O
workers O
. O

The O
food O
and O
logistics O
accommodation O
should O
not O
only O
be O
to O
my O
liking O
but O
also O
allow O
me O
to O
choose O
from O
various O
options O
. O

All O
this O
would O
cost O
the O
community O
less O
than O
we O
currently O
spend O
on O
healthcare O
. O

As O
an O
employee O
of O
the O
Company B-ORG
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
be O
recognized O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
merit O
, O
economic O
gratification O
, O
career O
progression O
, O
the O
commitment O
I O
have O
made O
in O
carrying O
out O
my O
work O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
be O
able O
to O
decide O
which O
Collaborators O
to O
surround O
me O
, O
what O
equipment O
to O
buy O
, O
what O
share O
of O
work O
to O
carry O
on O
and O
what O
to O
skip O
, O
when O
to O
go O
on O
vacation O
and O
which O
upgrade O
courses O
to O
follow O
. O

I O
would O
like O
nothing O
to O
be O
decided O
without O
first O
consulting O
me O
and O
I O
would O
like O
the O
workplace O
a O
few O
minutes O
from O
my O
home O
. O

This O
, O
of O
course O
, O
serves O
only O
as O
a O
benevolent O
provocation O
to O
then O
reach O
the O
core O
of O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
question O
regarding O
the O
General B-ORG
Directorate I-ORG
of O
the O
Company B-ORG
. O

Can O
anyone O
really O
believe O
that O
all O
of O
the O
above O
is O
achievable O
or O
not O
depending O
on O
the O
characteristics O
and O
inclinations O
of O
the O
Director O
- O
General O
? O

It O
is O
obvious O
, O
leaving O
the O
faces O
, O
that O
the O
Director O
- O
General O
of O
Provincial O
Health O
can O
influence O
many O
of O
these O
aspects O
, O
both O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
user O
citizen O
and O
for O
the O
citizen O
dependent O
on O
the O
Health O
Services O
, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
bring O
to O
the O
discussion O
the O
conviction O
that O
whoever O
manages O
the O
Health B-ORG
Company I-ORG
must O
adhere O
to O
the O
directives O
of O
who O
, O
for O
their O
own O
institutional O
mandate O
, O
must O
take O
care O
of O
the O
Health B-ORG
Service I-ORG
as O
a O
whole O
, O
that O
is O
, O
of O
the O
Policy O
. O

The O
Politician O
must O
tell O
the O
Director O
- O
General O
what O
path O
to O
take O
and O
must O
put O
in O
place O
checks O
that O
allow O
him O
to O
have O
feedback O
information O
to O
correct O
any O
digressions O
from O
the O
program O
. O

The O
operational O
part O
of O
the O
Management O
should O
be O
led O
by O
the O
political O
part O
that O
has O
the O
delicate O
task O
of O
making O
compatible O
the O
different O
, O
sometimes O
contradictory O
, O
demands O
of O
citizens O
towards O
public O
health O
. O

The O
politician O
must O
listen O
to O
everyone O
, O
but O
then O
it O
is O
fatal O
that O
he O
must O
make O
decisions O
, O
which O
can O
not O
please O
everyone O
. O

The O
mandate O
must O
be O
clear O
and O
equally O
explicit O
the O
instruments O
for O
measuring O
results O
. O

It O
is O
not O
conceivable O
that O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Director O
- O
General O
is O
assessed O
only O
near O
the O
expiration O
of O
the O
term O
of O
office O
. O

The O
Policy O
should O
have O
a O
constant O
return O
of O
what O
happens O
in O
the O
Healthcare B-ORG
Company I-ORG
both O
by O
those O
who O
produce O
the O
Services O
and O
by O
those O
who O
use O
them O
. O

As O
for O
the O
collaborators O
of O
the O
Director O
- O
General O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
priority O
positions O
of O
those O
who O
believe O
that O
only O
outside O
Trentino B-LOC
can O
be O
found O
Managers O
of O
a O
certain O
professional O
thickness O
should O
be O
rejected O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
the O
promotion O
of O
the O
" O
thirty O
" O
as O
such O
as O
judgment O
of O
merit O
must O
be O
rejected O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
it O
is O
the O
political O
- O
legislative O
system O
that O
causes O
the O
Director O
General O
to O
be O
surrounded O
by O
trusted O
collaborators O
and O
therefore O
it O
is O
consequent O
that O
the O
choice O
takes O
place O
according O
to O
certain O
criteria O
. O

The O
policy O
must O
therefore O
give O
precise O
guidelines O
and O
monitor O
their O
implementation O
, O
looking O
for O
corrections O
to O
those O
dysfunctions O
that O
ten O
years O
of O
Healthcare O
Entrepreneurship O
may O
have O
highlighted O
. O

This O
is O
an O
unfinished O
process O
, O
with O
both O
general O
and O
local O
aspects O
( O
role O
of O
hospitals O
, O
integration O
between O
them O
and O
with O
the O
territory O
, O
representativity O
of O
workers O
, O
verification O
of O
the O
work O
of O
the O
General O
Directorate B-ORG
only O
to O
name O
a O
few O
) O
still O
waiting O
for O
a O
solution O
. O

To O
think O
that O
the O
dismissal O
of O
the O
current O
Director O
- O
General O
represents O
the O
magic O
solution O
to O
health O
problems O
is O
an O
illusion O
. O

To O
rule O
an O
imposing O
machine O
like O
the O
Sanità O
Trentina O
, O
you O
also O
need O
to O
know O
its O
various O
aspects O
and O
the O
continuing O
revolution O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
management O
does O
not O
go O
in O
this O
direction O
. O

Take O
back O
the O
Policy O
of O
its O
leading O
role O
and O
equip O
us O
with O
participatory O
and O
verification O
tools O
that O
are O
shared O
as O
much O
as O
possible O

public O

The O
backpack O
with O
the O
most O
loved O
bear O
by O
children O
( O
49,50 O
euros O
) O
is O
blue O
, O
so O
it O
urges O
a O
coordinated O
match O
: O

This O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O

There O
are O
three O
measures O
. O

You O
can O
choose O
the O
largest O
one O
( O
23,90 O
euros O
) O
. O

There O
would O
also O
be O
to O
buy O
a O
bag O
separately O
, O
but O
it O
lacks O
that O
of O
the O
same O
shade O
. O

And O
then O
nothing O
. O

The O
little O
girl O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
rushes O
to O
the O
store O
, O
interested O
more O
in O
toys O
than O
in O
the O
“ O
commodities O
” O
she O
will O
have O
to O
take O
to O
school O
. O

A O
total O
of O
82 O
euros O
and O
90 O
cents O
. O

There O
are O
many O
different O
types O
of O
foods O
that O
can O
be O
used O
. O

The O
commissioner O
nodded O
and O
said O
: O

“ O
If O
you O
come O
early O
next O
year O
, O
you O
’ll O
have O
more O
choices O
. O
” O

My O
father O
is O
very O
practical O
: O

“ O
Maybe O
we O
’ll O
see O
you O
in O
three O
years O
. O
” O

Trendy O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

You O
can O
complain O
that O
in O
some O
cases O
the O
prices O
are O
exorbitant O
. O

It O
’s O
understandable O
a O
bit O
of O
bitterness O
in O
pulling O
out O
the O
wallet O
. O

But O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
always O
prevails O
the O
desire O
to O
buy O
the O
novelty O
. O

Both O
by O
the O
mothers O
, O
when O
the O
little O
ones O
are O
small O
, O
and O
by O
the O
older O
girls O
who O
shop O
alone O
. O

For O
boys O
, O
the O
speech O
is O
a O
little O
different O
, O
since O
they O
are O
often O
led O
to O
delegate O
. O

The O
re O
- O
evidence O
of O
fashion O
tension O
is O
given O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
proposals O
of O
the O
years O
back O
are O
sadly O
stacked O
in O
a O
corner O
, O
under O
the O
word O
“ O
offering O
” O
. O

Even O
with O
highly O
competitive O
prices O
, O
the O
backpacks O
of O
the O
“ O
old O
” O
cartoon O
characters O
no O
longer O
interest O
. O

And O
so O
The O
Simpsons O
, O
Sabrina O
, O
Arale O
, O
are O
sold O
at O
prices O
ranging O
from O
29 O
to O
39 O
euros O
. O

“ O
We O
’ve O
been O
behind O
tricks O
– O
confirms O
one O
commissioner O
– O
for O
at O
least O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

They O
have O
never O
been O
looked O
at O

because O
out O
of O
fashion O

” O

This O
year O
’s O
trend O
favors O
those O

themselves O
on O

One O
of O
the O

found O

The O
years O
pass O
, O
but O
not O
the O
success O
of O
the O
Seven B-ORG
backslides O
. O

Although O
we O
have O
heard O
them O
call O
“ O
Zen O
” O
( O
the O
number O
7 O
followed O
by O
the O
final O
“ O

can O
actually O
be O
confused O
with O
a O
zeta O
) O
, O
their O
fame O
remains O
constant O
. O

Generally O
, O
the O
basic O
backpack O
costs O
64 O
euros O
and O
90 O
euros O
. O

From O
this O
year O
, O
the O
trolls O
seem O
to O
have O
taken O
foot O
, O
very O
suitable O
for O
those O
who O
have O
to O
go O
a O
long O
way O
on O
foot O
and O
do O
not O
want O
to O
stay O
crushed O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
books O
. O

The O
cost O
is O
in O
line O
with O
that O
of O
a O
normal O
backpack O
. O

After O
a O
period O
of O
decline O
, O
the O
Invicta B-ORG
( O
68 O
euros O
) O
also O
seems O
to O
make O
a O
capstone O
again O
among O
the O
shelves O
, O
while O
, O
after O
dominating O
the O
1990s O

12 O

to O
have O
entered O
a O
period O
of O
tiredness O
, O
so O
much O
that O
in O
a O
bookstore O
we O
found O
it O
for O

with O
a O
20 O

discount O
. O

The O
boys O
seem O
to O
bet O
more O
on O
Comix O
( O
11 O
euros O
) O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
there O
are O
many O
different O
types O
of O

without O

they O
said O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
Mario B-PER
Bevilacqua I-PER
, O
a O
39 O

year O
- O
old O
native O
of O
Torre B-LOC
Annunziata I-LOC
, O
and O
Anna B-PER
Abbruzzese I-PER
, O
a O
39 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
born O
in O
Verona B-LOC
, O
both O
without O
a O
fixed O
home O
, O
also O
believed O
that O
the O
40 O

unattended O
thirty O

who O
had O
stumbled O
at O
their O
tail O
would O
never O
and O
will O
never O
denounce O
them O
. O

In O
this O
, O
however O
, O
they O
were O
wrong O
, O
so O
much O
it O
is O
true O
that O
the O
provincial B-ORG
operational I-ORG
core I-ORG
of O
the O
carabiniers B-ORG
commanded O
by O
Lieutenant O
Risottino B-PER
, O
informed O
of O
what O
happened O
, O
came O
back O
to O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
two O
and O
arrested O
them O
with O
the O
accusation O
of O
circumvention O
of O
incapable O
. O

The O
investigative O
activity O
had O
begun O
in O
the O
spring O
of O
this O
year O
when O
a O
lady O
of O
about O
40 O
years O
of O
Trento B-LOC
, O
won O
the O
shame O
, O
had O
appeared O
in O
the O
cell O
to O
denounce O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
35 O
thousand O
euros O
by O
two O
nomads O
who O
had O
promised O
to O
remove O
her O
blind O
eye O
but O
that O
once O
blocked O
the O
money O
had O
become O
irreversible O
. O

It O
’s O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
know O
how O
Mario B-PER
Bevilacqua I-PER
managed O
to O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
woman O
. O

Being O
one O
day O
at O
the O
wheel O
of O
her O
car O
and O
traveling O
at O
low O
speed O
, O
the O
lady O
was O
overtaken O
by O
a O
Mercedes O
who O
then O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
her O
at O
even O
smaller O
speed O
, O
so O
that O
she O
would O
overtake O
her O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
lady O
– O
who O
had O
done O
the O
maneuver O
correctly O
– O
heard O
a O
blow O
and O
soon O
saw O
the O
driver O
of O
the O
Mercedes O
making O
her O
headlights O
. O

She O
stopped O
and O
the O
man O
at O
the O
wheel O
of O
the O
sedan O
made O
her O
notice O
that O
he O
had O
damaged O
his O
left O
mirror O
. O

When O
the O
woman O
went O
out O
, O
although O
her O
car O
did O
not O
show O
any O
signs O
of O
the O
alleged O
collision O
, O
she O
agreed O
to O
reimburse O
a O
damage O
estimated O
by O
the O
man O
in O
a O
thousand O
euros O
, O
taking O
the O
money O
home O
with O
the O
nomad O
in O
front O
of O
her O
. O

It O
was O
speaking O
to O
the O
lady O
that O
the O
impostor O
realized O
that O
the O
person O
he O
had O
in O
front O
could O
be O
raised O
again O
. O

He O
discussed O
with O
her O
of O
the O
evil O
eye O
and O
negative O
influences O
and O
presented O
her O
in O
a O
later O
moment O
Anna B-PER
Abbruzzese I-PER
, O
dismissed O
as O
a O
wizard O
and O
visionary O
, O
expert O
- O
look O
at O
the O
case O
- O
of O
the O
evil O
eye O
. O

The O
forty O
- O
three O
- O
year O
- O
old O
, O
in O
a O
state O
of O
mental O
weakness O
, O
had O
completely O
lowered O
the O
guard O
and O
met O
five O
times O
with O
the O
" O
mage O
" O
, O
who O
for O
the O
" O
rites O
" O
he O
practiced O
, O
was O
paid O
a O
total O
of O
35 O
thousand O
euros O
. O

When O
the O
lady O
out O
of O
the O
period O
of O
confusion O
suspected O
that O
she O
had O
been O
ridiculed O
and O
cleaned O
off O
her O
money O
, O
she O
bitterly O
found O
that O
the O
exploiters O
had O
completely O
volatilized O
themselves O
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
he O
turned O
to O
the O
carabiniers B-ORG
. O

Their O
work O
was O
not O
easy O
at O
all O
, O
but O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
long O
investigation O
they O
managed O
to O
identify O
the O
culprits O

arrest O
them O

went O
on O

Monday O

at O

East O

And O
it O
was O
also O
a O
fulfillment O
linked O
to O
the O
flashing O
and O
propitiatory O
euphoria O
for O
the O
best O
days O
of O

It O
is O
successful O
, O
thanks O
to O
a O

the O

of O
the O

of O
Edward B-PER

, O
the O
last O

of O
the O
Brazilian O

transplanted O
to O
Switzerland B-LOC

But O
the O
show O
was O
not O
only O
a O
reanimation O
of O
well O
- O
known O
paintings O
but O
also O
gave O
popular O

suggestions O

The O
title O
of O
the O

is O
directed O
by O
a O

placed O
in O
the O
closing O
of O

while O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
piece O
is O
a O
continuous O
vortex O
of O
three O
rooms O
equal O
to O
each O
other O
, O
but O
within O
which O
stories O
with O
different O
protagonists O
take O
place O
. O

It O
is O
like O
looking O
at O
a O

at O

you O
see O
some O

In O

to O
this O

it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O

that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O

Kylie B-PER

in O
the O

a O

As O
those O

that O

continually O
turned O

or O
as O
in O

the O

perceived O

such O
by O

one O
who O

them O

But O
for O
the O
speed O
of O
the O
stage O
whirlwind O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
in O
the O
story O
the O
times O
and O
emotions O
represented O
overlap O
. O

The O
final O
reserves O
a O
surprise O
that O
encompasses O
everyone O
, O
which O
surprises O
the O

for O
its O
theatricality O

, O
in O
some O
way O
, O
reconnects O
to O
quite O
common O

during O
everyone O

As O
a O
creative O

, O
that O

This O
is O
underlined O
by O
the O
Court O

warning O
the O
“ O

” O
that O
if O
they O
want O
to O
avoid O

from O
interfering O

then O
they O
must O
place O

In O
essence O

mayors O
may O
not O
use O
the O

pursue O
purposes O

And O
they O
can O
not O
even O
argue O
that O
they O

there O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
the O
Cassation B-ORG
tells O
the O
city O

that O
it O
is O
enough O
to O
use O
a O
normal O

and O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
for O
mayors O
to O
“ O
invent O

” O

In O
the O
wake O
of O
these O
principles O
, O
the O
Cassation B-ORG
rejected O

” O

In O
addition O
to O
this B-PER
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
limited O

the O
quality O

In O
June O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
raise O
certain O

, O
which O
have O
been O
stopped O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

But O
we O
had O
been O
informed O
that O
the O
bus O
ticket O
to O
Trento B-LOC
would O
be O
substantially O
increased O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
transport O
subscriptions O
and O
the O
same O
train O
ticket O
have O
also O
increased O
. O

Increases O
in O
transportation O

% O

In O
the O
past O
few O
days O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
the O
Adoc B-ORG
referring O
to O
the O
UIL B-ORG
, O
has O
told O
us O
that O
the O
cost O
of O
school O
materials O
is O
leavening O
. O

But O
that O
union O
, O
along O
with O
the O
others O
, O
had O
accepted O
the O
tariff O
increase O
. O
” O

I O
’m O
sorry B-PER
, O
but O
the O
rate O
was O
still O
high O
in O
2000 O
. O

“ O
It O
is O
true O
, O
but O
inflation O
in O
the O
meantime O
has O
not O
been O
that O
set O
by O
the O
various O
governments O
and O
wages O
have O
come O
out O
very O
eroding O
. O

And O
there O
is O
another O
: O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
many O
public O
or O
parapublic O
services O
have O
deteriorated O
. O

Think O
about O
the O
railways O
. O

On O
certain O
routes O
, O
or O
even O
at O
certain O
times O
of O
the O
year O
, O
you O
do O
not O
find O
a O
place O
neither O
sitting O
nor O
standing O
. O

We O
think O
of O
the O
convoy O
arriving O
in O
Trento B-LOC
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
Christmas O
Market O
. O

At O
this O
point O
I O
say O
that O
the O
service O
is O
no O
longer O
suitable O
for O
the O
price O
. O

The O
trade O
union O
then O
, O
if O
it O
accepts O
the O
increase O
in O
tariffs O
, O
must O
demand O
the O
improvement O
of O
the O
service O
. O
” O

Paolo B-PER
Cunego I-PER
also O
notes O
that O
in O
this O
way O
the O
use O
of O
public O
means O
is O
discouraged O
, O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
that O
of O
private O
means O
. O

But O
the O
train O
is O
a O
national O
fact O
, O
we O
observe O
. O

“ O
The O
Railway O
of O
Valsugana O

also O
not O

comments O
Carlo B-PER
Borzaga I-PER
, O
chairman O
of O
economics B-ORG
- O
because O
our O
is O
a O
faculty B-ORG
of O
four O
hundred O
enrolled O
per O
year O
. O

Maintaining O
this O
foundation O
is O
important O
. O

Over O
a O
longer O
period O
of O
time O
, O
the O
trend O
is O
relatively O
stable O
. O

We O
must O
not O
forget O
that O
last O
year O
the O
economy B-ORG
saw O
a O
strong O
increase O
and O
that O
we O
are O
experiencing O
a O
strong O
competition O
. O

In O
perspective O
, O
we O
must O
explain O
to O
young O
people O
that O
our O
faculty B-ORG
does O
not O
prepare O
technicians O
, O
but O
managers O
able O
to O
fit O
into O
any O
professional O
sector O
. O

And O
then O
traditionally O
a O
noticeable O
recovery O
is O
observed O
in O
the O
following O
weeks O
. O

We O
expect O
a O
few O
dozen O
more O
registrations O
in O
the O
coming O
days O
. O
” O

It O
is O
also O
important O
that O
the O
specialized O
degrees O
- O
on O
which O
the O
faculty O
has O
put O
a O
lot O
of O
emphasis O
- O
have O
so O
far O
provided O
excellent O
feedback O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
there O
is O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
. O

Despite O
the O
difficulties O
arising O
from O
scarcity O
of O
resources O
and O
logistical O
problems O
that O
force O
faculty O
and O
students O
to O
move O
to O

, O
we O

from O

who O
choose O
to O
enroll O
right O
in O

and O
not O
elsewhere O
. O
” O

It O
is O
only O
regrettable O
that O
young O
people O
have O
not O
shown O
to O
appreciate O
European O
and O

legal O
sciences O
, O
an O

destined O
to O

In O

there O

“ O
The O

was O
killed O

” O
he O
says O

, O
“ O
at O

Not O
only O
, O
we O
have O
been O
told O
that O
when O
a O
pet O
escapes O

returns O
to O
the O
natural O
cycle O

it O
returns O
to O

So O
, O
in O
our O
case O
, O
it O
was O
hunting O
. O
” O

What O
did O
they O
say O
to O
the O
Federation B-ORG
? O

“ O
They O
reassured O
me O
and O
asked O
me O
not O
to O
move O
. O

That O
things O

clear O
up O
soon O

we O
have O
nothing O

” O

In O
the O

, O
the O

already O
been O
squared O

ended O
up O

him O

“ O

” O
Ioriatti B-PER
adds O

“ O
our O

not O
return O

his O

From O
the O
information O
we O
obtained O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
animal O
had O
already O
fled O
around O
May O

June O
from O
the O

it O
lived O

“ O
That O

it O

” O
he O
replied O
to O
the O

, O
“ O
The O
deer O
had O
fled O
on O
the O
6th O
of O
May. O

And O
I O

, O
after O
the O
escape O
, O
the O
Forestal B-ORG
had O
made O
an O
overflow O
at O
my O

So O
, O
having O
denounced O
the O
thing O
, O
one O
can O
not O
say O
that O
no O
one O
knew O
anything O
about O

Then O
the O
beast O
had O
the O

That O

why O
I O

I O

I O
do O

it O

“ O
We O

it O

the O
applicants O
write O
in O
the O

a O
variant O
to O
the O
PRG O
sent O

Mayor O

– O
that O
the O
whole O

( O
Laghetti B-LOC

, O
for O
its O
high O

original O

a O

primary O
agricultural O

equally O
from O
the O

Within O
this O

The O
first O
, O

the O
most O

This O
, O
in O
the O

stands O
out O
the O
creation O

that O

What O
does O
Professor O
Pugliese B-PER
not O
convince O
you O
of O
the O
proposals O
made O
by O
Advisor O
Gilmozzi B-PER
? O

These O
are O
useful O
measures O
, O
as O
for O
other O
things O
those O
put O
in O
place O
last O
year O
, O
but O
they O
are O
insufficient O
. O

The O
effects O
were O
not O
seen O
. O

It O
is O
not O
enough O
, O
in O
short O
, O
to O
block O
some O
diesel O
to O
hope O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
of O
thin O
dust O
. O

Their O
opinion O
: O

Is O
it O
better O
to O
set O
up O
an O
alternative O
blocking O
system O
? O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
I O
could O
say O
that O
this O
solution O
had O
brought O
more O
benefits O
. O

If O
nothing O
else O
, O
it O
offered O
a O
stronger O
message O
to O
the O
citizens O
because O
everyone O
was O
somehow O
involved O
. O

Today O
is O
different O
: O

The O
measure O
affects O
only O
a O
few O
vehicles O
and O
95 O
percent O
of O
the O
30 O
lose O
interest O
in O
following O
the O
case O
. O

How O
do O
you O
assess O
the O
relationship O
of O
the O
thirty O

the O
problem O

air O
pollution O
? O

Are O
they O
informed O
? O

Are O
they O
sensitive O
? O

I O
would O
say O
yes O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
the O
difficulty O
of O
moving O
from O
theory O
to O
practice O
when O
, O
i.e. O
, O
the O
measures O
concern O
them O
in O
the O
first O
person O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
use O
of O
gasoline O
has O
not O
been O
reduced O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
traffic O
continues O
to O
be O
the O
main O
cause O
of O
fine O
dust O
. O

If O
you O
were O
a O
counselor O
, O
what O
would O
you O
give O
the O
counselor O
? O

One O
thing O
is O
the O
emergency O
, O
the O
other O
is O
the O
structural O
plan O
. O

As O
for O
the O
first O
aspect O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
it O
is O
being O
done O
little O
. O

I O
repeat O
, O
I O
am O
in O
favor O
of O
alternate O
boards O
, O
total O
blocks O
of O
circulation O
, O
maybe O
even O
on O
scheduled O
days O
. O

What O
about O
structural O
measures O
? O

I O
agree O
with O
what O
the O
council B-LOC
says O
: O

Alternative O
mobility O
, O
enhanced O
public O
transportation O
, O
and O
the O
use O
of O
bicycles O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
you O
talk O
a O
lot O
, O
you O
write O
a O
lot O
, O
but O
everything O
moves O
very O
slowly O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
blessed O
public O
transport O
service O
should O
actually O
make O
it O
adequate O
. O

In O
Trento B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
is O
good O
, O
there O
is O
much O
to O
improve O
in O
the O
outskirts O
. O

As O
for O
example O
? O

The O
Metro O
of O
Valsugana O
. O

We O
’ve O
been O
talking O
about O
it O
for O
years O
, O
but O
when O
will O
we O
actually O
be O
able O
to O
use O
it O
? O

This O
is O
a O
criticism O
of O
the O
province B-LOC
. O

They O
produce O
so O
many O
documents O
, O
but O
they O
actually O
make O
big O
investments O
only O
for O
tunnels O
, O
bridges O
and O
roads O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
to O
promote O
private O
traffic O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
of O
the O
proposal O
of O
the O
municipal O
councillor O
Giampaolo B-PER
Berlanda I-PER
to O
allow O
access O
to O
the O
city O
only O
for O
payment O
, O
financing O
the O
free O
buses O
with O
the O
revenue O
? O

In O
principle O
, O
this O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
problem O
of O
translating O
it O
into O
reality O
. O

Last O

At O

of O
the O

, O
the O
mayor O
of O
Trento B-LOC

Alberto B-PER
Pacher I-PER
, O
thanked O
the O
three O

for O
“ O
representing O

with O
the O
organization O
of O
this O
façade O
, O
the O
deep O
indignation O
of O
our O
fellow O
citizens O
and O
the O
willingness O
to O
reiterate O
a O
resolute O
no O
to O
what O
is O
an O
insult O
to O
humanity O
” O
. O

“ O
What O
happened O
in O
Beslan B-LOC
– O
said O
Pacher B-PER
– O
constitutes O
the O
overcoming O
of O
an O
unimaginable O
threshold O
, O
and O
it O
is O
important O
that O
the O
whole O
city O
, O
without O
divisions O
or O
affiliations O
, O
be O
on O
the O
square O
to O
reaffirm O
values O
that O
unite O
all O
, O
in O
the O
name O
of O
a O
civilization O
that O
finds O
itself O
and O
of O
principles O
around O
which O
the O
idea O
of O
citizenship O
is O
built O
. O
” O

On O
the O
“ O
need O
for O
the O
entire O
citizenship O
to O
represent O
the O
horror O
and O
the O
loss O
for O
an O
immense O
tragedy O
, O
and O
to O
give O
a O
strong O
response O
to O
the O
culture O
of O
war O
and O
to O
a O
militarized O
policy O
that O
leads O
nowhere O
” O
, O
he O
emphasized O
Ruggero B-PER
Purin I-PER
, O
provincial O
secretary O
of O
the O
Cgil B-ORG
: O

“ O
Beyond O
the O
condolences O
and O
the O
obvious O
solidarity O
for O
the O
victims O
– O
insisted O
Purin B-PER
– O
this O
demonstration O
must O
also O
be O
an O
opportunity O
to O
revive O
cross O
- O
sectional O
solidarity O
and O
politics O
as O
a O
tool O
to O
overcome O
conflicts O
. O
” O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O

is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
use O
of O
the O

or O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
silence O
of O
this O
flare O
- O
up O
must O
be O
overwhelming O
, O
so O
that O
the O
culture O
of O
dialogue O
and O
peace O
may O
grow O
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
begin O
again O
to O
reconsider O
– O
Ferrante B-PER
concluded O
– O
the O
value O
of O
children O
for O
society O
. O

And O
so O
we O
invite O
all O
parents O
to O
bring O
their O
children O
to O
the O
event O
, O
so O
that O
Trento B-LOC
becomes O
a O
city O
not O
only O
alpine O
, O
but O
of O
peace O
and O
solidarity O
. O
” O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
“ O

stressed O
by O
Walter B-PER

The O

Delcroix I-PER
in O

introduction O

for O
twenty O
years O
now O
I O

so O

with O

It O
is O
not O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O

it O
is O
as O

what O
the O

is O
not O
, O
rather O
than O
say O
what O
it O
is O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
problem O
comes O
precisely O
from O

from O
the O
success O
of O

The O

it O

And O
the O
answer O
came O
from O
the O
beautiful O
sun O
that O
welcomed O
the O
blue O
charter O
. O

A O
little O
bit O
everyone O
wondered O
what O
the O
real O
political O
situation O
was O
, O
after O
the O
Moldovan O

had O
decided O
to O
move O
the O

The O
answer O
came O
from O
a O

found O
in O

then O
from O

on O

streets O
of O

around O

The O
echo O
of O

far O

hidden O
appear O
the O

of O
the O

The O
war O
between O
the O
two O

caused O
thousands O

and O
when O

taken O
away O

the O

Thus O
, O
although O
the O

had O
been O
calmed O
in O
the O

, O
the O
government O
of O

“ O
Let O

that O

” O

Always O
for O
ever O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
little O
more O
than O
as O
teenagers O
, O
we O
thought O
that O
tennis O
could O
become O
our O
life O
or O
, O
at O
least O
, O
a O
very O
important O
part O
of O
it O
. O

Valerio B-PER
Mosele I-PER
succeeded O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
was O
Valerio B-PER
himself O
, O
that O
small O
and O
thin O
little O
boy O
with O
a O
fist O
, O
get O
rid O
of O
his O
gorgeous O
eyebrows O
and O
always O
in O
motion O
, O
who O
, O
unconsciously O
, O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
the O
watershed O
, O
one O
of O
the O
many O
who O
proposes O
life O
to O
you O
: O

There O
were O
all O
those O
who O
played O
, O
even O
well O
, O
but O
for O
hobbies O
, O
there O
passed O
only O
those O
few O
who O
had O
accepted O
the O
renunciations O
and O
sacrifices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
become O
players O
for O
craft O
. O

And O
the O
passage O
was O
not O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
skill O
, O
but O
also O
of O
head O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
Valerio B-PER
, O
however O
, O
it O
has O
long O
been O
also O
a O
matter O
of O
courage O
. O

It O
is O
only O
because O
we O
were O
friends O
that O
we O
did O
not O
send O
him O
to O
that O
country O
when O
, O
without O
striking O
a O
blow O
, O
he O
was O
asphalting O
us O
with O
a O
bowl O
of O
ground O
strikes O
. O

You O
could O
draw O
it O
to O
him O
from O
every O
corner O
, O
right O
and O
back O
, O
but O
he O
always O
took O
it O
and O
drove O
it O
back O
, O
long O
, O
hardworked O
and O
poisonously O
deep O
. O

A O
beautiful O
arm O
, O
especially O
the O
reverse O
, O
unfortunate O
to O
him O
. O

And O
now O
, O
three O
or O
four O
tennis O
eras O
later O
, O
we O
found O
him O
in O
front O
of O
us O
, O
on O
a O
warm O
autumn O
day O
, O
in O
the O
gazebo O
of O
his O
circle O
, O
in O
Riva B-LOC
, O
talking O
about O
tennis O
that O
was O
but O
also O
about O
what O
will O
be O
. O

We O
found O
ourselves O
changed O
, O
but O
not O
so O
much O
, O
or O
at O
least O
not O
inside O
. O

He O
is O
a O
little O
more O
voluminous O
, O
but O
he O
has O
the O
stretched O
face O
of O
men O
who O
are O
at O
peace O
with O
their O
conscience O
and O
above O
all O
are O
doing O
a O
job O

love O

it O
is O

to O

is O

, O
that O
a O

has O
been O

for O
thirty O
years O
in O

with O
what O
happens O
in O
almost O
all O
other O

, O
where O
turn O

over O
has O
become O
almost O
a O
rule O

It O
’s O

, O
however O
, O
poses O
a O
question O

many O

in O

, O
have O
you O
had O
to O
swallow O
, O
Valerio B-PER

are O
many O

all O

the O
sense O
that O
they O
have O
served O
me O
to O
grow O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
grow O
, O
if O
you O
metabolize O
them O
well O

mistakes O
are O
also O
needed O

How O
many O

have O
you O
changed O
? O

“ O

difficult O
count O
, O
let O
’s O
say O
a O
tenth O

Did O
you O
agree O
with O
everyone O
? O

“ O
There O
have O
never O
been O
big O
problems O

But O
do O
you O
realize O
that O
, O
compared O
to O
your O

you O
are O
a O
white O
fly O
? O

“ O
Yes O
, O
it O
is O
not O
frequent O
that O
a O
teacher O
stays O
so O
long O
in O
the O

circle O

but O
I O
have O
been O
favoured O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
Riva B-LOC

see O
as O
the O
only O

I O
have O
lived O

I O

not O
the O

I O
work O

It O
has O
the O
number O
229 O

And O
then O
I O
love O
the O

come O

I O
would O
always O

follow O
them O

to O
get O
a O
good O
job O
, O
playing O
and O
winning O
with O
people O
who O
then O
made O
a O
career O

So O
I O
went O
to O
Rome B-LOC

to O
the O
national B-ORG
school I-ORG
of O
masters O
, O
and O
in O
two O
years O
, O
in O
' O
68 O
I O
graduated O
. O

I O
immediately O
found O
a O
place O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC
, O
then O
, O
from O
' O
74 O
, O
I O
came O
to O
Riva B-LOC
. O

And O
here O
I O
am O
. O
” O

Fresh O
as O
a O
rose O
. O

“ O
Now O
enough O
, O
I O
’m O
not O
complaining O
. O

Also O
because O
I O
could O
always O
work O
well O
and O
help O
many O
kids O
grow O
up O
. O
” O

There O
are O
beautiful O
names O
that O
came O
out O
of O
your O
school O

Then O
we O
did O
Serie B-ORG

I O
was O

When O
it O
comes O

after O

it O
also O
seems O
to O
you O
that O

slowly O

“ O
It O

had O
the O

it O

“ O
Shooting O

I O
have O
always O

playing O

should O
be O
a O
joy O
even O
if O
it O
is O
done O

I O
then O
realize O
that O
among O

the O
boys O
are O
overloaded O
with O
expectations O
and O
therefore O
stress O

We O

to O
move O

you O

an O
opportunity O

the O

From O
a O
sporting O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
company O
is O
quite O
challenging O
. O

This O
is O
the O
most O
famous O
long O
trekking O
in O
the O
Himalayas B-LOC
, O
210 O
kilometers O
with O
a O
route O
that O
starts O
from O
an O
altitude O
of O
800 O
meters O
, O
rises O
up O
to O
5 O
thousand O
and O
then O
rises O
to O
the O

So O
far O
, O
the O
record O
of O
the O
route O
is O
nine O
days O
, O
set O
by O
four O
Germans O

Sartori B-PER
expects O
to O
take O
four O

The O
Perginean O
champion O
is O
not O
new O
to O

In O
1998 O
he O
ranked O
second O
at O
the O
World O
High O
Marathon O
Championship O
in O
Tibet B-LOC

This O
year O
, O
he O
came O
eighth O
in O
the O
100 O

world O
championship O
in O
the O

In O
his O
career O
he O
won O
the O
100 O

won O
numerous O

His O

for O
him O

Sartori B-PER
, O
however O
, O
does O
not O
hide O
the O
difficulties O
: O

The O
goal O
is O
to O
run O
the O
210 O
kilometers O
in O
the O
shortest O
time O
possible O
. O

In O
theory O
, O
I O
could O
do O
it O
in O
four O
days O
, O
thinking O
I O
could O
do O
52 O
kilometers O
a O
day O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
not O
said O
. O

The O
biggest O
problem O
is O
the O
altitude O
. O

The O
start O
is O
840 O
meters O
, O
then O
you O
go O
up O
to O
5 O
thousand O
and O
400 O
and O
finally O
you O
go O
down O
. O

The O
route O
is O
the O
classic O
of O
the O
Annapurna B-LOC
trekking O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
famous O
in O
the O
Himalayas B-LOC
. O

I O
have O
already O
run O
high O
. O

In O
1998 O
I O
arrived O
second O
by O
surprise O
at O
the O
World O
Cup O
in O
Tibet B-LOC
and O
I O
saw O
that O
I O
react O
well O
, O
but O
every O
race O
is O
an O
undertaking O
in O
itself O
. O

We O
have O
to O
see O
how O
it O
will O
go O
this O
time O
. O
” O

The O
real O
business O
will O
start O
on O
16 O
October O
, O
after O
a O
few O
days O
of O
setting O
up O
. O

The O
next O
day O
Sartori B-PER
should O
go O
up O
to O
the O
Thorong B-LOC
Pass I-LOC

from O
there O
start O
the O
descent O
until O
the O
arrival O

He O
will O
run O
on O
a O

about O
a O

wide O
and O
will O
sleep O
in O
the O
lodges O
that O
usually O
welcome O

cementing O
in O
the O

To O
eat O
, O
Sartori B-PER
will O
have O
to O
arrange O

“ O
I O
’ll O
take O
myself O
behind O
in O
the O

In O
the O

For O
accommodation O
there O
will O
be O
things O
that O

will O
bring O
before O
departure O

From O
that O
point O
of O
view O
, O
there O
should O
be O
no O
problems O

” O

There O
are O
no O
problems O
to O
create O
even O
the O
Maoist O

now O
control O
much O

" O
As O

I O
know O

" O
Sartori B-PER
explains O
, O
" O
they O
have O
never O

also O
because O
they O
know O
that O
they O
carry O
valuable O

also O
buy O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
happen O
is O
that O
they O
stop O
you O
and O
make O
you O
a O
gunshot O
on O
their O
Maoist O
principles O

then O
let O
you O
go O
after O

you O
for O

still O
the O

Imagine O
if O
art O
entered O
the O
world O
of O
work O
. O

Imagine O
your O
office O
empty O
of O
everything O
, O
the O

cleansed O
from O
the O
stamps O
and O

to O
be O
wiped O
out O
, O
and O
the O
computers O

to O
support O
video O
artistic O

. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
delusion O
of O
the O

employee O
and O
not O
even O
the O
latest O
episode O
of O

Instead O
, O
it O
is O
what O
happened O
last O
Saturday O
at O
a O
company O
in O
Trento B-LOC
that O
brought O
artists O
and O
multimedia O
works O
through O
the O
corporate O

in O
the O

in O

In O
collaboration O
with O
the O

to O
the O

of O
Francesco B-PER

until O
tomorrow O
it O
will O
be O
possible O
to O
visit O
the O
work O
of O
ten O
internationally O
renowned O
artists O
who O
have O
inserted O
their O
works O
in O
the O
work O
offices O
. O

This O
is O
an O
interesting O
idea O
that O
aims O
at O
the O
comparison O
with O
the O
“ O
intermediate O
soul O
” O
. O

Hence O
the O
title O
of O
the O
event O
: O
“ O
Interfaces O
” O
. O

To O
use O
the O
words O
of O
the O
curator O
Bonazzi B-PER
, O
this O
week O
“ O
Asteria O
will O
not O
only O
be O
the O
place O
of O
the O
event O
, O
the O
cradle O
and O
crossroads O
of O
technical O
and O
creative O
synergies O
but O
also O
the O
hub O
of O
exchanges O
and O
interactions O
. O

In O
this O
place O
, O
between O

, O
multiple O
faces O
and O
borders O
, O
between O
connections O
and O
linguistic O
parameters O
, O
artists O
are O
encouraged O
to O
integrate O
their O
language O
with O
new O
technologies O
. O
” O

Let O
’s O
see O
quickly O
and O
not O
exhaustively O
who O
the O
artists O
involved O
were O
and O
what O
they O
proposed O
. O

Beginning O
with O
Antoni B-PER
Abad I-PER
who O
created O
a O
" O
benign O
" O
virus O
consisting O
of O
a O
fly O
made O
of O
pixels O
that O
swirls O
freely O
through O
the O
computer O
screens O
and O
that O
through O
the O
Internet O
is O
able O
to O
multiply O
thus O
giving O
rise O
to O
a O
heap O
of O
virtual O
flies O
. O

It O
is O
then O
passed O
to O
the O
works O
of O
Stefano B-PER
Cagol I-PER
and O
his O
games O
of O
doubling O
of O
the O
metropolitan O
horizon O
that O
propose O
strange O
and O
familiar O
landscapes O
. O

It O
is O
then O
the O
turn O
of O
Loris B-PER
Cecchini I-PER
with O
his O
unlikely O
yet O
real O
architecture O
to O
realize O
the O
project O
of O
a O
squatter O
house O
built O
on O
a O
pillar O
of O
light O
. O

Then O
again O
the O
imaginary O
landscapes O
of O
Eva B-PER
Marisaldi I-PER
who O
takes O
the O
spectators O
on O
an O
unstoppable O
journey O
. O

It O
’s O
the O
work O
of O
Takehito B-PER
Koganezawa I-PER
who O
gets O
unbelievable O
symphonies O
in O
sampling O
images O
and O
noises O
of O
everyday O
life O
. O

Then O
Louis B-PER
Nero I-PER
’s O
experimental O
video O
that O
brings O
the O
experience O
of O
cinematography O
into O
video O
art O
with O
surprising O
results O
of O
poetry O
and O
existential O
suspension O
. O

The O
route O
between O
the O
corporate O
corridors O
continues O
with O
the O
work O
of O
Oliver B-PER
Pietsch I-PER
with O
three O
fragments O
of O
a O
path O
between O
the O
surreal O
and O
the O
real O
. O

Follow O
Xenja B-PER
Plasma I-PER
with O
a O
video O
that O
is O
a O
lucid O
, O
obsessive O
and O
vibrant O
dream O
in O
the O
eternal O
quest O
for O
hospitality O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
work O
of O
Kiki B-PER
Seror I-PER
, O
who O
borrows O
the O
verbal O
images O
of O
chat O
lines O
, O
highlighting O
what O
the O
web O
produces O
and O
proposes O
. O

The O
collective O
performance O
concludes O
with O
a O
work O
by O
Giulia B-PER
Zuanni I-PER
that O
renounces O
communication O
for O
images O
by O
immersing O
instead O
the O
viewer O
in O
a O
dark O
and O
silent O
diade O
made O
only O
of O
intimate O
words O
, O
thus O
putting O
the O
viewer O
back O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
artistic O
event O
. O

The O
Asteria B-ORG
experiment O
was O
successful O
. O

The O
inauguration O
was O
not O
only O
an O
opportunity O
to O
meet O
and O
meet O
artists O
and O
communicators O
, O
but O
also O
an O
event O
open O
to O
the O
city O
and O
, O
ultimately O

to O

The O
first O
: O

“ O
That O
between O
the O
West O

the O
Islamic O
world O
, O
there O
are O
incomplete O
differences O
, O
an O
abyss O
of O
culture O
and O
history O
. O

This O
is O
a O
tragic O
misunderstanding O
. O

The O
Muslim O
world O
has O
been O
part O
of O
Western O
culture O
since O
its O
formation O
, O
primarily O
for O
a O
historical O
and O
geographical O
factor O
: O

Islam O
has O
been O
present O
in O
Sicily B-LOC
, O
Spain B-LOC
and O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
. O

There O
are O
also O
the O
common O
religious O
origins O
that O
are O
in O
the O
Abrahamian O
tradition O
and O
in O
the O
profound O
bond O
given O
by O
the O
belief O
in O
the O
unity O
of O
God B-PER
. O

And O
then O
there O
is O
the O
common O
basis O
of O
Hellenism O
: O

Islam O
can O
not O
be O
understood O
without O
Plato B-PER
and O
Aristotle B-PER
. O

How O
do O
we O
talk O
about O
foreign O
cultures O
? O

“ O
The O

The O
relationship O
between O
Islam O
and O
Christianity O
has O
never O
been O
easy O
. O

This O
is O
all O
to O
see O
too O
: O

Historically O
, O
there O
was O
the O
confrontation O
, O
but O
also O
the O
encounter O
. O

Islam O
and O
Christianity O
before O
and O
Europe B-LOC
then O
, O
have O
had O
relations O
for O
thirteen O
centuries O
that O
have O
also O
been O
of O
violence O
, O
of O
enmity O
, O
but O
always O
within O
a O
connection O
, O
of O
a O
bond O
that O
has O
never O
been O
broken O
: O

Despite O
the O
Crusades O
, O
diplomatic O
, O
commercial O
and O
cultural O
relations O
continued O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
however O
, O
a O
“ O
ideology O
of O
confrontation O
” O
prevailed O
, O
between O
1400 O
and O
1700 O
, O
because O
of O
the O
fear O
of O
the O
Turks O
pressing O
on O
the O
boundaries O
of O
Catholic O
Europe B-LOC
. O

And O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
Muslim O
world O
, O
how O
has O
this O
relationship O
been O
experienced O
? O

Even O
Islam O
has O
developed O
a O
“ O
ideology O
of O
confrontation O
” O
entirely O
speculative O
, O
following O
the O
experience O
of O
contact O
with O
the O
West O
: O

He O
felt O
endangered O
by O
the O
Crusades O
, O
by O
colonialism O
, O
and O
then O
by O
the O
support O
given O
to O
Israel B-LOC
, O
and O
sprinkled O
the O
enmity O
towards O
Europe B-LOC
, O
which O
, O
however O
, O
was O
never O
continuous O
. O

And O
like O
in O
the O
West O
, O
here O
too O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
global O
conflict O
was O
developed O
. O

But O
everything O
falls O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
what O
we O
could O
call O
small O
and O
large O
optical O
phenomena O
: O

Astigmatism O
, O
myopia O
, O
presbyopia O
, O
the O
inability O
to O
see O
things O
in O
their O
right O
proportions O
. O

Europeans O
also O
fought O
against O
each O
other O
for O
religious O
reasons O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
between O
Islamists O
and O
Westerners O
one O
will O
never O
be O
able O
to O
reach O
the O
level O
of O
hatred O
and O
cruelty O
reached O
, O
for O
example O
, O
by O
the O
religious O
wars O
in O
1400 O
- O
1500 O
in O
Europe B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
this O
has O
not O
prevented O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
common O
European O
consciousness O
. O
” O

How O
can O
we O
then O
consider O
the O
failed O
attempt O
by O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Italian O
political O
world O
to O
include O
in O
the O
European O
Constitution O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
Christian O
origins O
of O
Europe O
? O

When O
we O
talk O
about O
cultural O
roots O
, O
we O
must O
resist O
the O
simplistic O
and O
integralist O
temptation O
of O
aut O
aut O
, O
because O
cultures O
usually O
develop O
on O
et O
et O
, O
that O
is O
, O
on O
the O
coexistence O
of O
different O
traditions O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
Europe B-LOC
has O
Christian O
roots O
, O
but O
these O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
are O
not O
the O
only O
ones O
. O
” O

The O
Crusades O
began O
in O
a O
period O
of O
crisis O
of O
Christianity O
, O
cultural O
and O
economic O
: O

This O
is O
the O
situation O
in O
the O
Arab O
countries O
today O
. O

Is O
Islam O
a O
crossroads O
? O

and O
no O
. O

In O
current O
Islam O
there O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
process O
, O
very O
limited O
qualitatively O
and O
quantitatively O
, O
of O
degeneration O
, O
which O
has O
roots O
and O
connotations O
typically O
Western O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
recent O
developments O
of O
globalization O
that O
accentuate O
and O
make O
evident O
to O
all O
the O
enormous O
disparities O
between O
the O
West O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Islamic O
world O
has O
identified O
in O
the O
development O
of O
rich O
countries O
the O
reason O
for O
Muslim O
decay O
. O

We O
have O
therefore O
started O
from O
a O
historically O
true O
constatation O
, O
which O
is O
, O
however O
, O
used O
captivately O
to O
justify O
the O
necessity O
of O
holy O
war O
. O

What O
is O
our O
responsibility O
in O
all O
this O
? O

“ O
European O
culture O
is O
now O
plagued O
by O
a O
dangerous O
schizophrenia O
. O

We O
have O
built O
our O
identity O
for O
at O
least O
three O
centuries O
now O
on O
values O
such O
as O
equality O
, O
freedom O
and O
social O
justice O
that O
we O
continue O
to O
disregard O
in O
our O
relations O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

And O
then O
the O
fundamentalist O
reaction O
is O
also O
a O
reaction O
to O
the O
disillusionment O
caused O
in O
Muslim O
countries O
by O
contact O
with O
the O
West O
, O
which O
first O
promised O
independence O
and O
development O
and O
then O
denied O
everything O
. O
” O

But O
why O
did O
religion O
become O
the O
vehicle O
of O
this O
conflict O
? O

Because O
religious O
discourse O
takes O
hold O
in O
an O
Islamic O
world O
made O
up O
of O
one O
billion O
and O
three O
hundred O
million O
people O
who O
are O
part O
of O
that O
80 O
% O
of O

population O
living O
in O
poverty O

In O
the O
face O
of O
this O
element O
of O
colossal O
injustice O
, O
what O
language O
could O
a O
political O
agitator O
choose O
to O
strike O
consciences O
? O

It O
is O
the O
religious O
language O
that O
indicates O
in O
the O
Western O
world O
“ O
Jewish O
– O
Christian O
– O
Atheist O
” O
the O
“ O
great O
Satan O
guilty O
of O
everything O
” O
. O

Where O
does O
integralism O
come O
from O
? O

“ O
The O
Islamic O
fundamentalist O
movement O
is O
a O
newly O
born O
movement O
in O
the O
1920s O
as O
a O
short O
circuit O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
violence O
of O
Western O
expansion O
. O

There O
is O
a O
rediscovery O
of O
religious O
values O
lived O
paradoxically O
in O
a O
very O
Western O
, O
ideologized O
way O

It O
is O
the O
image O
of O
a O

Islam O
that O
must O
win O
against O
the O
Western O

that O
is O
no O

Fortunately O

despite O
the O
efforts O
we O
make O
with O
our O
choices O
to O
propagate O
fundamentalism O
, O
the O
Muslims O
who O
adhere O
to O
it O
are O
few O
, O
so O
I O
believe O
that O
integralism O
will O
never O
develop O
again O
. O
” O

And O
yet O
the O
attacks O
continue O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
increasing O
the O
intensity O
of O
violence O
... O

But O
this O
is O
precisely O
why O
terrorist O
movements O
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
dangerous O
: O

Because O
they O
realize O
that O
their O
area O
of O
development O
is O
very O
limited O
and O
then O
they O
harden O
their O
practice O
. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
tragedy O
of O
Beslan B-LOC
is O
born O
. O
” O

Instead O
, O
we O
explore O
the O
opposite O
field O
, O
that O
of O
the O
West O
. O

Is O
the O
war O
against O
terrorism O
not O
at O
risk O
of O
having O
all O
the O
characteristics O
of O
a O
politically O
and O
religiously O
integralist O
Crusade O
? O

“ O
There O
is O
one O
aspect O
, O
for O
example O
, O
concerning O
Bush B-PER
and O
his O
circle O
, O
that O
if O
I O
were O
not O
a O
believer O
I O
would O
call O
religious O
involvement O
in O
a O
fanatical O
sense O
. O

I O
am O
a O
practicing O
Catholic O
, O
I O
do O
not O
like O
to O
talk O
about O
religious O
involvement O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
return O
to O
rough O
forms O
of O
relationship O
between O
religion O
and O
politics O
. O

When O
I O
see O
the O
images O
of O
Americans O
praying O
at O
Ground O
Zero O
, O
I O
rely O
on O
the O
mass O
media O
submission O
and O
the O
force O
of O
the O
fanatizing O
ideological O
apparatus O
. O

Praying O
all O
together O
in O
front O
of O
television O
out O
loud O
is O
not O
my O
way O
of O
understanding O
religion O
. O

In O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
there O
is O
an O
old O
Protestant O
fundamentalist O
root O
, O
linked O
to O
what O
they O
call O
the O
“ O
manifest O
destiny O
” O
of O
the O
nation O
. O

Is O
this O
all O
religion O
? O

It O
is O
a O
political O
view O
of O
faith O
. O

Does O
it O
mean O
a O
crucifixion O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
exists O
in O
Islamic O
Jihad O
but O
also O
in O
the O
Western O
world O
today O
. O
” O

How O
can O
we O
get O
out O
of O
this O
vicious O
circle O
? O

Is O
it O
possible O
? O

“ O
Not O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

The O
only O
way O
is O
to O
dismantle O
the O
maniac O
vision O
that O
is O
being O
propelled O
to O
us O
by O
the O

, O
embroiled O
by O
politicians O
and O
powerful O
powers O
, O
of O
a O
world O
divided O
into O
two O
between O
evil O
and O
good O
. O

We O
must O
react O
as O
they O
did O
in O
France B-LOC
after O
the O
abduction O
of O
journalists O
. O

As O
a O
right O
- O
wing O
man O
and O
as O
a O
European O
citizen O
, O
I O
have O
been O
proud O
of O
the O
feeling O
of O
national O
unity O
and O
compactness O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
the O
French O
express O
. O
” O

In O
what O
sense O
? O

They O
did O
not O
give O
in O
to O
blackmail O

To O
the O
kidnappers O
who O
demand O
the O
abolition O
of O
the O
veil O
law O
in O
a O
unitary O
way O
, O
from O
right O
to O
left O
, O
it O
has O
been O
answered O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
law O
against O
the O
Islamists O
and O
the O
Muslim O
community O
itself O
, O
contrary O
to O
the O
law O
, O
has O
rejected O
external O
interference O

But O
at O
the O

time O
, O
France B-LOC
is O
not O
even O
aligned O

what O
to O

in O

The O
logic O

an O
open O

” O

There O
are O
many O
promises O
and O
promises O
: O

The O
bicycle O
is O
getting O
harder O
. O

Take O
the O
cyclists O
around O
. O

The O
next O
day O
there O
was O
another O
accident O
involving O
a O
cyclist O
. O

At O
the O
crossroads O
between O
Via B-LOC
Vittorio I-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
and O
Via B-LOC
Lorenzoni I-LOC
: O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
century O
, O
the O
world O
’s O
most O
famous O
cities O
were O
located O
in O
the O
southern O

in O
the O
southern O

Fortunately O
, O
there O
were O
no O
serious O
consequences O

The O
man O
a O
head O
injury O

but O
never O
lost O
consciousness O
and O
was O
accompanied O
to O
the O
hospital O
by O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
for O
examinations O
. O

The O
incident O
, O
however O
, O
raises O
a O
series O
of O
questions O
, O
which O
relate O
to O
the O
micro O
( O
the O
take O
- O
over O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Via B-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
cycling O
track O
) O
and O
the O
macro O
( O
the O
policy O
for O
cyclists O
of O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
) O
. O

As O
for O
Via B-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
, O
the O
telenovela O
of O
the O
cycling O
track O
is O
now O
in O
the O
final O
stage O
, O
that O
of O
de O
profundis O
. O

Opened O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
track O
occupies O
half O
of O
the O
sidewalk O
forcing O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
to O
an O
impossible O
coexistence O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
is O
not O
even O
a O
cycling O
track O
: O

It O
is O
just O
a O
white O
strip O
of O
paint O
. O

The O
cycling O
track O
on O
Via B-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
has O
always O
been O
a O
colossal O
joke O
: O

This O
is O
a O
dangerous O
situation O
for O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
, O
which O
ends O
in O
nothing O
. O

At O
the O
crossroads O
of O
Via B-LOC
Mattioli I-LOC
he O
strikes O
straight O
against O
the O
new O
grizzly O
rings O
. O

In O
some O
sections O
( O
from O
the O
« O
Bronzetti O
» O
) O
is O
less O
than O
forty O
centimeters O
wide O
, O
which O
must O
be O
enough O
for O
cyclists O
transiting O
in O
both O
directions O
. O

If O
the O
Public O
Works B-ORG
Inspectorate I-ORG
applied O
the O
Road O
Code O
, O
it O
should O
report O
to O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
. O

It O
’s O
just O
looking O
a O
few O
kilometers O
away O
from O
here O
( O
I O
do O
n’t O
say O
to O
Bolzano B-LOC
... O
just O
Rovereto B-LOC
) O
to O
note O
two O
things O
: O

Cycling O
tracks O
are O
separated O
from O
pedestrian O
traffic O
. O

It O
is O
marked O
with O
red O
asphalt O
. O

And O
here O
the O
problem O
is O
more O
general O
, O
that O
of O
this O
city O
’s O
policy O
for O
cyclists O
. O

I O
remember O
perfectly O
a O
1986 O
press O
conference O
in O
which O
the O
adviser O
Roberto B-PER
De I-PER
Bernardis I-PER
, O
on O
a O
regular O
bike O
seat O
, O
summoned O
the O
press O
to O
the O
“ O
Mariner O
” O
to O
explain O
that O
Trento B-LOC
would O
have O
by O
1994 O
an O
“ O
efficient O
network O
of O
cycling O
trails O
from O
north O
to O
south O
and O
chopsticks O
in O
the O
historic O
center O
” O
. O

the O
ball O
. O

They O
have O
been O
joking O
at O
us O
for O
years O
. O

We O
cyclists O
, O
who O
try O
to O
fight O
smog O
and O
take O
responsibility O
for O
healthier O
and O
eco O
- O
friendly O
mobility O
, O
are O
sacrificed O
on O
the O
altar O
of O
the O
engines O
. O

When O
we O
do O
n’t O
get O
« O
beaten O
down O
» O
to O
the O
cycle O
passes O
– O
pedestrian O
like O
it O
happened O
to O
the O
wicked O
yesterday O
. O

Trento B-LOC
is O
known O
as O
the O
“ O
Alpine O
City O
of O
2004 O
” O
. O

It O
means O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
; O

But O
the O
music O
is O
always O
the O
same O
. O

On O
two O
wheels O
, O
you O
risk O
the O
skin O
. O

They O
also O
make O
fun O
of O
you O
