He O

Yesterday O
he O
was O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
Faculty B-ORG

Cognitive I-ORG
Sciences I-ORG
was O
inaugurated O
. O

" O
At O
the O
Italian O
level O
, O
cuts O
make O
life O
more O
difficult O
: O

There O
are O
too O
stringent O
rules O
. O

In O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
thanks O
to O
autonomy O
, O
things O
are O
much O
better O
. O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
we O
must O
focus O
more O
and O
more O
on O
scientific O
research O
: O

" O
The O
University B-ORG
has O
its O
competences O
. O

Often O
research O
does O
not O
guarantee O
immediate O
results O
. O

It O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
long O
- O
term O
investments O
, O
which O
sometimes O
lead O
to O
unthinkable O
outlets O
. O

In O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
there O
is O
talk O
of O
creating O
a O
hydrogen O
and O
renewable O
energy O
district O
. O

Is O
this O
the O
sector O
in O
which O
to O
invest O
? O

" O
The O
question O
is O
complex O
. O

Certainly O
Trento B-LOC
can O
not O
miss O
the O
opportunity O
to O
invest O
in O
clean O
energies O
such O
as O
hydrogen O
. O

This O
is O
true O
both O
for O
the O
academic O
world O
and O
for O
the O
entrepreneurial O
one O
. O

The O
University B-ORG
will O
have O
a O
new O
rector O
and O
the O
possibility O
to O
plan O
investments O
. O

That O
of O
renewable O
energies O
is O
a O
fundamental O
road O
, O
but O
there O
is O
also O
room O
for O
other O
sectors O
. O

Then O
we O
must O
not O
underestimate O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
Faculty B-ORG
of I-ORG
Cognitive I-ORG
Sciences I-ORG
, O
which O
has O
great O
potential O
. O

When O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
University O
of O
Trento O
, O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
fundamental O
role O
played O
by O
the O
Province B-LOC
's O
funding O
. O

Then O
there O
are O
the O
national O
research O
projects O
. O

But O
in O
the O
future O
, O
will O
economic O
support O
come O
from O
private O
enterprise O
? O

" O
I O
believe O
that O
private O
companies O
will O
never O
give O
too O
much O
to O
research O
. O

Yes O
, O
contributions O
can O
and O
must O
come O
also O
from O
companies O
, O
but O
their O
role O
is O
another O
: O

They O
can O
identify O
the O
most O
promising O
areas O
, O
make O
available O
collaborators O
and O

applications O

that O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
Gialloblu O

is O
confident O
: O

" O
Regarding O
my O
physical O
condition O
at O
the O
moment O
I O
do O

feel O
like O
going O
overboard O

We O
hope O

the O

does O
not O
evolve O
into O
a O
tendinopathy O
, O
otherwise O
the O
recovery O
time O

; O

For O
now O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
I O
will O
do O
everything O
to O
be O
on O
the O
field O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
perhaps O
as O
early O
as O
next O
Sunday O
, O
when O
we O
will O
be O
on O
the O
scene O
in O
Sal√≤ B-LOC
, O
an O
away O
game O
that O
deserves O
all O
our O
attention O
. O

Analyzing O
yesterday O
's O
match O
, O
I O
think O
we O
paid O
a O
high O
price O
for O
the O
emotion O
of O
our O
debut O
in O
front O
of O
our O
public O
. O

We O
wanted O
so O
much O
to O
do O
well O
and O
to O
get O
off O
on O
the O
right O
foot O
, O
but O
we O
must O
not O
forget O
that O
for O
many O
of O
my O
teammates O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time O
in O
this O
series O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
everything O
, O
I O
think O
we O
played O
an O
excellent O
game O
, O
putting O
in O
all O
the O
intensity O
we O
are O
capable O
of O
. O

In O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
match O
we O
were O
not O
brilliant O
, O
I O
admit O
, O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
first O
half O
we O
tried O
to O
play O
the O
game O
and O
impose O
our O
own O
game O
and O
I O
think O
that O
for O
long O
stretches O
we O
succeeded O
quite O
well O
. O

Do O
not O
forget O
the O
goal O
ball O
on O
the O
feet O
of O
Toccoli B-PER
( O
in O

picture O

the O

ed O
) O
, O
where O
it O
was O
good O
their O
goalkeeper O
to O
oppose O
with O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
also O
the O
goal O
canceled O
to O
Dal B-PER
Ferro I-PER
for O
a O
millimeter O
offside O
. O

In O
the O
second O
half O
the O
heat O
became O
the O
absolute O
protagonist O
. O

Surely O
we O
have O
suffered O
more O
than O
them O
, O
but O
probably O
this O
is O
also O
due O
to O
the O
physical O
structure O
: O

They O
are O
more O
minute O
and O
quicker O
players O
than O
us O
. O

Now O
we O
have O
the O
whole O
week O
in O
front O
of O
us O
to O
work O
and O
to O
get O
ready O
at O
best O
for O
the O
next O
match O
, O
correcting O
the O
mistakes O
made O
, O
but O
starting O
from O
what O
was O
good O
. O

I O
hope O
to O
be O
back O
at O
the O
coach O
's O
disposal O
and O
I O
'm O
confident O
, O
especially O
in O
light O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
next O
week O
, O
we O
will O
have O
a O
better O
physical O
condition O
than O
the O
one O

The O
dispute O
of O

is O
complicated O

in O

The O
clash O
between O
the O
unions O
of O
Trentino O
on O
the O
renewal O
of O
the O
contract O
of O

has O
no O
precedent O

neither O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
nor O
nationally O
- O
says O
Roberto B-PER
Vivian I-PER
, O
secretary O
Fps B-ORG
CISL I-ORG
- O
. O

The O
instigation O
to O
the O
conflict O
to O
every O
level O
makes O
difficult O
the O
negotiation O
and O
disorientates O
the O
workers O
. O

We O
are O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
an O
election O
campaign O
for O
the O
renewal O
of O
the O
Rsu B-ORG
and O
the O
denigrating O
action O
of O
some O
unions O
seems O
almost O
a O
strategy O
, O
in O
view O
of O
the O
appointment O
of O
mid O
- O
November O
, O
date O
of O
the O
elections O
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
find O
a O
common O
position O
. O

Labor O
contracts O
can O
not O
be O
legitimized O
only O
by O
those O
who O
think O
they O
have O
the O
majority O
, O
especially O
when O
this O
majority O
is O
not O
representative O
of O
all O
the O
professionalism O
to O
which O
the O
contract O
is O
intended O
. O

The O
existing O
contrast O
is O
evidenced O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
five O
trade O
unions O
entitled O
to O
negotiate O
have O
presented O
five O
different O
platforms O
. O

" O
This O
is O
a O
dangerous O
anomaly O
- O
Vivian B-PER
continues O
- O
. O

The O
contract O
must O
provide O
for O
salary O
increases O
linked O
to O
inflation O
, O
as O
occurred O
at O
the O
national O
level O
. O

At O
this O
stage O
, O
in O
defense O
of O
the O
salary O
, O
we O
will O
ask O
Apran B-ORG
the O
balance O
provided O
for O
2002 O
- O
2003 O
on O
the O
salary O
in O
the O

measure O
paid O
by O
the O

, O
even O
with O
a O
partial O
agreement O
to O
be O
signed O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
then O
continue O
negotiations O
on O
all O
other O
matters O
. O

To O
further O
complicate O
the O
dispute O
, O
there O
is O
the O
question O
of O
the O
funds O
allocated O
, O
considered O
insufficient O
. O

" O
The O
CISL B-ORG
has O
won O
the O

that O

used O
resources O

Only O
at O

that O
for O

circulating O

that O

Massimo B-PER
Egidi I-PER
could O
, O
in O

The O

it O

an O

The O
skepticism O

by O

French O

the O

" O
spirit O

( O

the O

incongruous O

that O

The O

The O

Signifredi B-PER
for O
fraud O

L O
' O
buyer O

not O
even O
paid O

after O
the O
arrest O
of O
the O
accountant O

Chini B-PER
feels O
cheated O
by O
Paolo B-PER
Signifredi I-PER
. O

For O
this O
reason O
the O
' O
building O
contractor O
has O
filed O
a O
complaint O
against O
the O
accountant O
of O
Parma B-LOC
who O
had O
purchased O
the O
Chini B-ORG
construction I-ORG
for O
one O
thousand O
euros O
, O
money O
that O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
Signifredi B-PER
has O
never O
paid O
. O

Signifredi B-PER
a O
few O
days O
after O
the O
' O
purchase O
of O
Chini B-ORG
was O
arrested O
by O
the O
Guardia O
di O
Finanza O
because O
he O
had O
to O
serve O
a O
sentence O
of O
three O
years O
for O
receiving O
stolen O
goods O
and O
recycling O
of O
a O
' O
car O
. O

The O
arrest O
of O
Signifredi B-PER
precipitated O
the O
situation O
and O
in O
a O
few O
days O
the O
Court B-ORG
of I-ORG
Trento I-ORG
declared O
the O
bankruptcy O
of O
Chini B-ORG
. O

A O
month O
later O
the O
Public O
Prosecutor B-ORG
's I-ORG
Office I-ORG
requested O
the O
arrest O
of O
Chini B-PER
and O
his O
son O
Gianluca B-PER
, O
who O
were O
being O
investigated O
for O
fraudulent O
bankruptcy O
. O

Subsequently O
Chini B-PER
decided O
to O
denounce O
Signifredi B-PER
. O

The O
accountant O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
the O
white O
knight O
called O
to O
save O
Chini B-ORG
and O
, O
instead O
, O
was O
the O
one O
who O
sunk O
it O
. O

But O
the O
complaint O
for O
fraud O
is O
probably O
linked O
to O
a O
series O
of O
agreements O
that O
the O
two O
entrepreneurs O
had O
made O
. O

Chini B-PER
reproached O
Signifredi B-PER
for O
not O
having O
kept O
faith O
with O
the O
commitments O
, O
for O
having O
deceived O
him O
about O
the O
seriousness O
of O
his O
intentions O
. O

Chini B-PER
, O
in O
fact O
, O
has O
always O
maintained O
that O
the O
company O
could O
easily O
avoid O
bankruptcy O
, O
since O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
the O
licenses O
for O
five O
commercial O
centers O
that O
Chini B-ORG
had O
in O
mind O
to O
build O
in O
the O
Northeast O
would O
have O
arrived O
. O

These O
were O
deals O
that O
would O
have O
definitively O
restored O
the O
Chini B-ORG
coffers O
. O

Businesses O
that O
could O
not O
be O
concluded O
due O
to O
bankruptcy O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
the O
curatorship O
that O
tries O
to O
draw O
the O
sums O
. O

Naturally O
, O
the O
revenues O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
much O
lower O
than O
in O
a O
normal O
management O
. O

Chini B-PER
had O
left O
the O
task O
of O
managing O
these O
affairs O
to O
Signifredi B-PER
who O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
creditors O
and O
then O
sell O
the O
company O
to O
a O
building O
contractor O
from O
Grosseto B-LOC
, O
Galeardi B-PER
. O

L O
' O
arrest O
of O
the O
accountant O
, O
however O
, O
has O
blown O
up O
everything O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
Chini B-PER
felt O
cheated O
and O
decided O
to O
file O
a O
complaint O
. O

The O
entrepreneur O
felt O
he O
was O
the O
victim O
of O
a O
deception O
because O
in O
his O
view O
Signifredi B-PER
had O
all O
the O
means O
available O
to O
save O
the O
company O
. O

This O
would O
have O
, O
of O
course O
, O
also O
safeguarded O
the O
position O
of O
the O
same O
Chini B-PER
who O
later O
ended O
up O
under O
house O
arrest O
and O
is O
now O
still O
under O
investigation O
with O
his O
son O
with O
the O
charge O
of O
fraudulent O
bankruptcy O
. O

Chini B-PER
even O
risks O
to O
lose O
his O
house O
, O
since O
it O
is O
registered O
to O
his O
former O
company O
and O
now O
it O
could O
be O
sold O
at O
auction O
by O
the O
curator O
. O

The O
court B-ORG
of I-ORG
re I-ORG
- O
examination O
annulled O
the O
orders O
against O
Spagnolo B-PER
and O
Trentini B-PER
. O

Shot O
by O

, O
two O
released O

Gianfranco B-PER
Spagnolo I-PER
and O
Fulvio B-PER
Trentini I-PER
have O
been O
exonerated O
by O
the O
re O
- O
examination B-ORG
court I-ORG
for O
the O

in O
the O
Dusevich B-PER
house O
. O

Trentini B-PER
, O
defended O
by O
' O
lawyer O
Mario B-PER
Murgo I-PER
, O
so O
he O
was O
able O
to O
leave O
the O
prison O
of O
Vicenza B-LOC
to O
return O
to O
house O
arrest O
, O
while O
Spagnolo B-PER
is O
still O
in O
prison O
in O
Tolmezzo B-LOC
, O
accused O
of O
other O
crimes O
. O

The O
two O
are O
accused O
by O
the O
Carabinieri B-ORG
of O
having O
participated O
in O
the O
heist O
together O
with O
Walter B-PER
Zanetti I-PER
and O
Paul B-PER
John I-PER
Pallaoro I-PER
. O

According O
to O
what O
is O
contested O
by O
the O
Prosecutor B-ORG
's I-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
the O
two O
would O
only O
have O
organized O
the O
hit O
, O
which O
would O
then O
have O
been O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
two O
accomplices O
, O
who O
have O
been O
recognized O
by O
two O
people O
. O

The O
organizational O
conduct O
would O
have O
taken O
place O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
places O
by O
Trentini B-PER
who O
had O
carried O
out O
renovation O
work O
there O
. O

The O
witnesses O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
claimed O
that O
the O
two O
robbers O
moved O
inside O
their O
house O
with O
perfect O
knowledge O
of O
the O
places O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
they O
knew O
where O
the O
safe O
was O
. O

According O
to O
the O
investigators O
, O
Trentini B-PER
would O
have O
provided O
Spanish O
with O
the O
information O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
job O
, O
but O
according O
to O
the O
judges O
of O
the O
court B-ORG
of I-ORG
review I-ORG
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
this O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
judges O
note O
that O
Trentini B-PER
remained O
in O
prison O
from O
1999 O
to O
2003 O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
could O
not O
have O
participated O
in O
the O
renovation O
work O
in O
the O
Dusevich B-PER
house O
in O
recent O
times O
. O

He O
himself O
told O
the O
judge O
that O
he O
had O
done O
the O
work O
in O
1992 O
. O

Given O
the O
time O
elapsed O
, O
the O
judges O
doubt O
that O
Trentini B-PER
can O
be O
the O
source O
of O
information O
so O
detailed O
as O
to O
allow O
the O
robbers O
to O
move O
perfectly O
at O
ease O
in O
the O
Dusevich B-PER
house O
. O

Passardi B-PER
tries O
to O
solve O
the O
main O
problem O
at O
the O
root O
, O
that O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
biotope O
of O
the O
Laghetti B-LOC
in O
the O
part O
closest O
to O
the O
rocky O
wall O
. O

In O
order O
not O
to O
damage O
such O
a O
delicate O
environment O
, O
he O
launches O
the O
idea O
of O
moving O
the O
road O
, O
which O
now O
passes O
alongside O
, O
realizing O
it O
ex O
novo O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
plain O
, O
along O
the O
embankment O
of O
the O
Adige B-LOC
River O
. O

In O
this O
way O
all O
the O
traffic O
, O
consisting O
of O
trucks O
loaded O
with O
garbage O
that O
commute O
to O
the O
landfill O
of O
Ischia B-LOC
Podetti I-LOC
but O
in O
the O
future O
also O
by O
direct O
means O
to O
the O
companies O
of O
the O
pole O
of O
the O
scrap O
, O
would O
be O
distant O
from O
the O
biotope O
and O
the O
system O
of O
access O
to O
the O
various O
companies O
could O
be O
organized O
in O
a O
rational O
manner O
along O
the O
river O
. O

The O
shrewdness O
would O
also O
allow O
to O
transform O
the O
current O
road O
into O
a O
bike O
path O
that O
would O
make O
more O
enjoyable O
just O
the O
area O
of O
the O
biotope O
and O
the O
climbing O
wall O
. O

But O
the O
delicate O
environmental O
balance O
of O
the O
Laghetti B-LOC
will O
be O
in O
danger O
if O
other O
precautions O
are O
not O
taken O
. O

Because O
beyond O
the O
wetlands O
, O
the O
biotope O
is O
a O
delicate O
habitat O
, O
frequented O
among O
other O
things O
by O
some O
species O
of O
birds O
of O
prey O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
to O
be O
very O
careful O
also O
to O
the O
acoustic O
impact O
of O
working O
activities O
and O
light O
pollution O
at O
night O
. O

Here O
therefore O
that O
the O
workings O
will O
have O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
such O
a O
way O
as O
not O
to O
disturb O
, O
therefore O
substantially O
inside O
sheds O
, O
and O
the O
external O
lighting O
will O
have O
to O
be O
subjected O
to O
limits O
and O
controls O
. O

One O
of O
the O
problems O
repeatedly O
reported O
and O
that O
worry O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
Vela B-LOC
is O
the O
height O
of O
the O
water O
table O
, O
placed O
practically O
at O
the O

of O
the O
country O
floor O
. O

Inevitably O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
work O
, O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
recharge O
the O
area O
with O
large O
amounts O
of O
soil O
. O

But O
this O
is O
considered O
from O
the O
technical O
point O
of O
view O
one O
of O
the O
most O
easily O
solvable O
problems O
and O
at O
affordable O
costs O
, O
especially O
at O
a O
time O
like O
this O
of O
great O
enough O
material O
, O
seen O
for O
example O
the O
excavation O
of O
the O
tunnel O
under O
Martignano B-LOC
. O

Nor O
would O
it O
be O
a O
big O
problem O
to O
find O
the O
hydraulic O
solutions O
to O
avoid O
that O
the O
intervention O
could O
affect O
, O
in O
case O
of O
flood O
, O
the O
inhabited O
area O
of O
the O
suburb O
. O

Some O
headache O
could O
be O
caused O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
power O
line O
that O
crosses O
the O
area O
and O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
present O
regulations O
and O
the O
relative O
respect O
bands O
, O
will O
have O
to O
be O

, O
with O
all O
that O
it O
involves O
in O
terms O
of O
expense O
but O
above O
all O
of O
times O
. O

In O
short O
, O
there O
are O
problems O
but O
they O
seem O
solvable O
. O

It O
is O
now O
up O
to O
the O

decide O
if O

A O
solution O
that O

had O
been O
foreseen O
by O

that O

" O
In O
our O
opinion O
- O
said O
President O
Armando B-PER

- O
the O
most O
appropriate O
solution O
would O
be O
to O
try O

first O
, O
that O

, O
between O

. O

The O
district B-LOC

also O
called O

its O
opinion O

the O

has O
given O
a O
positive O
opinion O

Red O
disk O
instead O
for O

In O

Trentofrutta B-ORG

preparing O
to O
celebrate O
16 O
years O
of O
life O
under O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
Philipp B-PER
family O
, O
which O
took O
over O

, O
by O
filing O
a O
2003 O

by O
the O
Parmalat B-ORG
case O
. O

The O
net O
loss O
of O
345,000 O
euros O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
was O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
devaluation O
, O
for O
638,117 O
euros O
, O
of O
trade O
receivables O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
default O
of O
the O
company O
now O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
extraordinary O
commissioner O
Enrico B-PER
Bondi I-PER
. O

Without O
this O
adjustment O
, O
the O
year O
would O
have O
ended O
in O
profit O
, O
given O
that O
the O
gross O
operating O
margin O
was O
positive O
, O
while O
turnover O
rose O
from O
39 O
to O
42 O
million O
euros O
, O
due O
to O
the O
average O
increase O
in O
the O
price O
of O

. O

The O
year O
2004 O
, O
that O
the O
financial O
director O
Primo B-PER
Murru I-PER
defines O
as O
normal O
, O
should O
bring O
a O
return O
to O
profit O
after O
the O
one O
, O
of O
about O
30.000 O
euros O
, O
registered O
in O
2002 O
. O

The O
decisive O
months O
will O
be O
those O
which O
are O
missing O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year O
, O
given O
that O
between O
October O

November O
a O
large O
part O

the O
raw O

( O

But O
this O
last O
foreshortening O
of O

has O
brought O
, O
after O
24 O
months O
of O
hope O
, O
a O
certainty O
not O
very O
appreciated O
by O
the O
company O
. O

The O
negotiation O
with O
the O
City B-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
to O
move O
the O
production O
unit O
of O
Via B-ORG
Degasperi I-ORG
in O
another O
land O
has O
ended O
with O
nothing O
. O

The O
company O
sent O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
deputy O
mayor O
and O
town O

Alessandro B-PER
Andreatta I-PER
to O
ask O
that O
the O

be O
removed O
from O

. O

The O
managing O
director O
Luz B-PER
Philipp I-PER
, O
son O
of O
the O
president O
Armin B-PER
( O
reconfirmed O
by O
the O
assembly O
of O
last O
Friday O
) O
is O
sorry O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
company O
" O
has O
lost O
24 O
months O
waiting O
for O
the O
answer O
, O
blocking O
investments O
to O
modernize O
the O
oldest O
part O
, O
which O
dates O
back O
to O
' O
61 O
, O
of O
the O
structure O
. O

We O
are O
now O
no O
longer O
looking O
for O
another O
area O
. O

I O
confirm O
that O
we O
will O
stay O
here O
, O
we O
have O
no O
intention O
of O
transferring O
the O
activity O
: O

We O
will O
remain O
in O
Trento B-LOC
" O
. O

The O
possibility O
of O
Trentofrutta B-ORG
's O
" O
move O
" O
was O
blown O
up O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
economic O
agreement O
. O

The O
company O
, O
which O
specifies O
that O
it O
had O
received O
an O
offer O
to O
move O
and O
had O
never O
asked O
for O
it O
, O
was O
asking O
for O
a O
zero O
- O
cost O
exchange O
: O

in O
the O
sense O
that O
it O
would O
have O
moved O
only O
if O
the O
burden O
of O
the O
transfer O
would O
have O
been O
compensated O
by O
the O
transfer O
of O
the O
land O
, O
including O
in O
the O
overall O
calculation O
also O
the O
investments O
, O
considered O
necessary O
to O
modernize O
the O
less O
new O
part O
of O
the O
plant O
. O

Now O
, O
after O
24 O
months O
, O
the O
study O
can O
start O
again O

how O

By O

of O
the O

, O
it O
is O
hoped O
that O
the O

then O
fall O
back O
just O
below O
49 O

According O
to O
analysts O
, O
the O
acceleration O
of O
prices O
is O
always O
driven O
by O
the O
slowdown O
in O
production O
that O
occurred O
in O
the O

in O
the O

However O

the O

Royal B-ORG

But O
the O

the O
most O
violent O
of O
those O
that O

that O

, O
the O
scenario O

possible O

according O

After O
the O
evaluations O
expressed O
in O

by O
the O
International B-ORG

, O
according O
to O
which O
the O

will O
be O
reflected O
in O
a O
lower O

of O
the O

point O

yesterday O
the O
ECB B-ORG
came O
out O

according O
to O
which O
there O
are O
, O
at O
this O
point O
, O
uncertainties O
about O

, O
mainly O
related O

And O
the O
Minister O

Domenico B-PER

the O
surge O

also O
worries O
Italy B-LOC

especially O
with O
regard O
to O

. O

In O
short O
, O
the O
race O
for O
now O
unstoppable O
oil O
prices O
is O
now O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
debate O
on O
the O
prospects O
of O
global O
economic O
recovery O
and O
macroeconomic O
forecasts O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
it O
was O
in O
particular O
the O
President O
of O
the O
European B-ORG
Central I-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
Jean O
- O
Claude B-PER
Trichet I-PER
, O
who O
summarized O
the O
concerns O
of O
European O
central O
bankers O
, O
stressing O
that O
" O
the O
high O
prices O
reached O
by O
oil O
have O
had O
a O
visible O
direct O
impact O
" O
on O
inflation O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
according O
to O
Trichet B-PER
, O
we O
have O
already O
seen O
the O
effects O
on O
the O
dynamics O
of O
consumer O
prices O
, O
which O
are O
unlikely O
to O
fall O
below O
2 O
% O
in O
the O
Eurozone O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year O
. O

The O
greatest O
fear O
, O
however O
, O
concerns O
the O
possibility O
that O
indirect O
effects O
will O
appear O
, O
which O
until O
now O
have O
not O
occurred O
or O
at O
least O
have O
been O
contained O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
these O
are O
the O
unwelcome O
consequences O
represented O
by O
an O
increase O
in O

As O
a O
city O
councilor O
, O
Pompermaier B-PER
is O
disappointed O
by O
how O
little O
has O
been O
done O
in O
Trento B-LOC
from O
a O
structural O
and O
logistical O
point O
of O
view O
: O

" O
It O
's O
been O
six O
years O
that O
we O
've O
been O
talking O
about O
parking O
and O
beyond O
the O
former O
Zuffo O
and O
Via O
Monte O
Baldo O
, O
we O
have O
n't O
seen O
anything O
else O
. O

People O
must O
also O
be O
given O
alternatives O
, O
and O
then O
we O
can O
hit O
hard O
those O
who O
do O
not O
exploit O
them O
. O

Iva B-PER
Berasi I-PER
, O
former O
provincial O
councillor O
for O
the O
environment O
, O
is O
also O
convinced O
that O
more O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
: O

" O
Gilmozzi B-PER
's O
plan O
is O
the O
continuation O
of O
what O
I O
had O
set O
out O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
removing O
the O
most O
polluting O
vehicles O
from O
circulation O
is O
the O
least O
that O
can O
be O
done O
, O
but O
we O
must O
n't O
stop O
there O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
this O
is O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
is O
not O
perceived O
by O
the O
people O
, O
and O
so O
people O
are O
stalling O
. O

Instead O
it O
is O
a O
serious O
situation O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
health O
of O
children O
. O

We O
need O
long O
- O
term O
planning O
to O
remove O
cars O
from O
the O
cities O
, O
but O
these O
are O
things O
that O
we O
have O
been O
saying O
for O
years O
, O
to O
the O
point O
that O
by O
now O
I O
'm O
annoyed O
to O
hear O
myself O
say O
them O
. O

To O
push O
States O
, O
Regions O
and O
local O
authorities O
to O
do O
more O
, O
the O
European B-LOC
Union I-LOC
also O
tries O
with O
its O
directives O
. O

The O
directive O
on O
fine O
dust O
provides O
that O
from O
' O
next O
year O
can O
not O
be O
exceeded O
for O
more O
than O
35 O
times O
the O
limits O
of O
attention O
of O
50 O
micrograms O
. O

This O
year O
in O
Trento B-LOC
we O
are O
already O
44 O

50 O
. O

What O
will O
happen O
if O
this O
happens O
again O
in O
2005 O
? O

Nothing O
will O
happen O
. O

There O
are O
no O
sanctions O
but O
only O
an O
obligation O
to O
define O

in O

the O
ingenious O

But O
Dellai B-PER

is O
not O
the O
only O

used O
by O

in O

They O

twelve O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
blue O

And O
for O
the O
councillors O
who O
are O
left O
without O
a O
car O
, O
the O
Province B-LOC
has O
thought O
of O
a O
cab O

, O
which O
makes O
it O
possible O
to O
cover O

The O
most O
diligent O
in O
providing O
their O
leaders O
with O
blue O
cars O
has O
been O
the O
regional B-ORG

In O
fact O
, O
there O
are O
three O
blue O

( O
Audi O

, O
with O
three O

and O
to O
his O
two O

Who O
are O
better O
placed O
, O
however O
, O
are O
the O
councillors O
of O
the O
regional B-ORG

There O
are O
three O
of O
them O
, O
Adelino B-PER
Amistadi I-PER
, O
Marta B-PER
Stocker I-PER

Florian B-PER

, O
but O
they O
have O
four O
blue O

at O
their O
disposal O
, O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
choosing O
between O
the O
Audi O

that O
Roland B-PER

so O
much O

or O
the O

In O

, O
the O
President O

Vice O
- O
President O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
, O
Durnwalder B-PER

Dellai B-PER
, O
already O
have O
their O
own O
blue O
car O
and O
therefore O
do O
not O
use O
that O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
, O
which O
thus O
remains O
the O
prerogative O
of O
the O
three O
councillors O
. O

But O
the O
Region B-LOC
, O
despite O
not O
having O
more O
skills O
or O
almost O
, O
also O
has O
two O
Ford O

a O

two O
Fiat O

a O

which O

four O

, O
make O
ten O
. O

Too O
many O
for O
an O
institution O
in O

, O
so O
as O
to O
have O
pushed O
to O
make O
an O
agreement O
with O
the O

" O
no O

of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
to O
complete O
some O

on O
the O

in O
Viale B-LOC
Verona I-LOC
would O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
breakdown O
of O

There O
are O
still O

for O
1 O

waiting O
for O

of O
the O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
starting O
last O
spring O
, O
the O
police B-ORG

met O
with O
President O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
and O
then O
with O
Vice O
President O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
, O
explaining O
the O
situation O
and O
the O
need O
to O
move O
to O
the O
new O

only O
when O
it O
will O
be O
completely O
finished O
. O

On O
the O
part O
of O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
the O
maximum O
availability O
to O
the O

, O
with O
the O
promise O
of O

This O
promise O
was O
also O
reiterated O
in O
a O
meeting O
between O
President O
Dellai B-PER
and O
the O
Chief O
of O
Police O
Nicola B-PER
D'Agostino I-PER
during O
the O
summer O
months O
. O

The O
Province B-LOC
would O
therefore O
participate O
in O
the O
completion O
of O
the O
structure O
. O

Is O
everything O
alright O
? O

No O
, O
because O
from O
Rome B-LOC
it O
is O
known O
- O
for O
now O
informally O
- O
that O
there O
is O
some O
perplexity O
about O
this O
step O
. O

" O
We O
now O
want O
to O
understand O
how O
the O
Chief O
of O
Police O
intends O
to O
behave O
, O
because O
in O
this O
way O
we O
risk O
losing O
the O
funding O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
- O

Gianfranco B-PER
Conte I-PER
of O
the O
Sap B-ORG
of O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
the O
autonomous B-ORG
police I-ORG
union I-ORG
- O
Since O
the O
' O
beginning O
we O
have O
initiated O
a O
joint O
table O
of O
unions O
Siulp B-ORG
, O
Silp B-ORG
Cgil I-ORG
and O
Sap B-ORG
, O
to O
solve O
together O
the O
problem O
of O
the O
new O

. O

We O
have O
already O
said O
that O
we O
will O
move O
only O
if O
the O

there O
will O
be O

the O

, O
the O

of O
the O

. O

We O
have O
therefore O
asked O
for O
the O
' O
intervention O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
perhaps O
by O
doing O
the O
accounts O
without O
the O
' O
innkeeper O
since O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
this O
was O
not O
appreciated O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
Rome B-LOC
does O
not O
tolerate O
the O
interference O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
in O
such O
matters O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
former O
Chief O
of O
Police O
of O
Trento B-LOC
Francesco B-PER
Colucci I-PER
, O
who O
should O
know O
well O
the O
local O

. O

" O
We O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
Questore O
D'Agostino B-PER
has O
received O
an O
official O
communication O
- O
explains O
the O
Sap B-ORG

but O
we O
have O
received O
news O
of O
perplexity O
about O
the O
intervention O
of O
the O

on O
the O

who O
is O
now O

of O

But O
we O
, O
the O

, O
have O
turned O
to O
President O
Dellai B-PER
in O

with O
a O
circular O
letter O
of O
the O
Chief O
of O
Police B-ORG
which O
indicates O
to O
the O

the O
possibility O
, O
if O

to O
ask O
the O

to O
this O

, O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O

informed O

the O

: O

1 O

According O

the O

the O
Adige B-LOC

one O
of O
those O
that O

even O
if O
it O

that O
, O
often O
, O
the O

( O
even O

how O
that O

who O
had O
to O
make O
his O

forgot O
his O

or O
that O

But O
one O
morning O
you O
wake O
up O
, O
and O
you O
realize O
that O
this O
is O
not O
just O
a O
dream O
. O

Running O
after O
a O
ball O
, O
training O
and O
sacrifice O
, O
after O
hours O
of O

, O
tired O
or O
angry O
from O
the O
umpteenth O
argument O
with O
his O

no O

It O
is O
no O
longer O
your O
parallel O
life O
, O
a O
switch O
that O
turns O
on O
or O
off O
... O
It O
is O
your O
life O
itself O
. O

Everything O
takes O
on O
a O
clearer O
meaning O
and O
you O
are O
able O
to O
live O
your O
favorite O
sport O
with O
serenity O
, O
because O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
has O
always O
characterized O
your O
desire O
to O
train O
, O
the O
disappointment O
for O
the O

the O
joy O

the O
endless O

can O
be O
summarized O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
poem O
by O
Pedro B-PER
Salinas I-PER
, O
Madrid O
poet O
of O
the O
last O
century O
: O
" O
Do O
not O
reject O
dreams O
because O
they O
are O
dreams O
. O

All O
dreams O
can O
be O
reality O
, O
if O
the O
dream O
does O
not O
end O

Reality O
is O
a O
dream O
. O
" O
You O
, O
amateur O
footballer O
, O
are O
not O
a O
professional O
, O
your O
earnings O
in O
proportion O
, O
are O
nothing O
. O

However O
, O
you O
can O
say O
with O
certainty O
that O
you O
are O
not O
a O
worse O
man O
, O
and O
perhaps O
your O
passion O
is O
purer O
, O
because O
every O
time O
you O
put O
on O
the O
shoes O
and O
a O
shirt O
, O
entering O
the O
field O
, O
you O
run O
and O
run O
and O
at O
the O
end O
you O
are O
exhausted O
, O
but O
you O
return O
as O
a O
child O
, O
happy O
with O
a O
' O
primordial O
emotion O
, O
and O
this O
you O
will O
never O
be O
tired O

Initially O
, O
the O
Egyptian O
authorities O
had O
spoken O
of O
a O

, O
then O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
a O
targeted O

attack O
with O
the O
use O
of O

came O
to O
light O
- O
and O
was O

The O

a O

As O

Egypt B-LOC
immediately O
authorized O
Israeli O

then O
bring O
the O

the O

The O
Israeli O
newspaper O
Haaretz B-ORG
on O
line O
, O
citing O
Israeli O
security O
sources O
, O
immediately O
gained O
the O
conviction O
that O
the O
Taba B-LOC
explosion O
was O
attributable O
to O
a O
terrorist O
act O
. O

There O
is O

the O

this O

came O

knew O
well O

In O
the O
following O
days O
the O

, O
specialized O
in O
teaching O

subjects O
, O
obtained O
the O

did O
not O

who O
, O
after O

have O
asked O

obtained O

In O

drew O
up O

After O
the O
inspection O
, O
a O
letter O
with O
15 O
signatures O
was O
sent O
to O
the O

: O

a O
document O
requesting O
, O
in O
essence O
, O
confirmation O
of O
the O
assignment O
of O

chair O
. O

" O
We O
would O
like O
to O
call O

to O
be O
more O
tolerant O

problems O

to O
avoid O

them O

L O
' O
inspector O
Pulisizzi B-PER
had O
not O
found O
the O
extremes O
for O
a O
disciplinary O
measure O
( O
the O
quality O

promoted O
by O
N.D. B-PER
was O
indeed O
widely O
recognized O
) O
and O
had O
left O
open O
the O
road O
of O
" O
conciliation O
" O
. O

The O
alternative O
was O
an O
agreed O
displacement O

In O
the O
end O
this O
second O

was O
chosen O
: O

N.D. B-PER
will O
go O
to O
be O
a O
support O
teacher O
at O
Pigarelli B-ORG
. O

His O
truth O
, O
however O
, O
is O
another O
: O

Today O
he O
wants O
to O
clarify O
that O
, O
on O
his O
part O
, O
there O
was O
the O
will O
to O
continue O
the O
work O
done O
at O

: O

" O
An O
attack O

made O

. O

On O
August O
30 O
, O
the O
manager O
Brioli B-PER
proposed O
me O
to O
choose O
between O
two O
classes O
at O
Pigarelli B-ORG
and O
two O
at O
S.Anna B-ORG
. O

At O
that O
point O
I O
also O
accepted O

I O
never O
said O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
return O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
friction O
between O
the O
teacher O
and O
some O
families O
has O
deep O
roots O
. O

The O
sex O
education O
lesson O
is O
only O
the O

episode O
in O

I O
understand O

says O
N.D. B-PER
, O
" O
that O
many O
are O
accustomed O

methods O

I O
have O
always O
tried O
, O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
, O
to O
make O
the O
lesson O
more O
interesting O
. O

For O
example O
, O
I O
use O
statistics O
published O
in O

to O
teach O
that O

is O
also O
current O
events O

And O
if O
they O
ask O
me O
how O

, O
I O
prepare O
a O

The O

its O
object O
this O
case O
. O

The O
investigators O
have O
decided O
to O
acquire O
all O
the O
medical O
records O
of O
the O
woman O
. O

The O
hypothesis O
of O
crime O
at O
this O
time O
is O
manslaughter O

The O

has O
been O
opened O

" O

In O
essence O

at O
this O
time O
there O
are O
no O
suspects O

This O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
situation O
is O
radically O
different O
from O
the O
past O
. O

The O
first O
investigation O
had O
started O
from O
nine O
deaths O
, O
although O
then O
only O
five O
cases O
had O
passed O
the O
threshold O
of O
expertise O
. O

Now O
we O
are O
faced O
with O
only O
one O
death O
, O
moreover O
doubtful O
because O
the O
woman O
had O
previously O
been O
hospitalized O
in O
Bologna B-LOC
and O
therefore O
there O
is O
no O
certainty O
that O
she O
contracted O
the O
infection O
at O
Santa O
Chiara O
. O

It O
is O
no O
coincidence O
that O
the O
file O
opened O
for O
now O
hypothesizes O
only O
the O
crime O
of O
manslaughter O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
there O
is O
no O
possibility O
of O
an O
epidemic O
, O
not O
even O
a O
nosocomial O
epidemic O

Four O
cases O

In O

we O
have O
been O
very O
attentive O
to O
the O
high O
cost O
of O

, O
" O
Lunardi B-PER
said O
on O

, O
" O
and O
since O
the O

not O
tend O

, O
we O
have O
proposed O
a O

of O
measures O
to O
counteract O

Beside O
the O
measures O
such O
as O
" O
the O

, O
the O
reduction O

, O
Lunardi B-PER
has O
also O
raised O
the O

of O

Lunardi O
has O

And O
to O
free O
the O

from O

coming O
a O
mechanism O
of O

as O
a O
function O

by O

by O
the O

that O

. O

" O
The O
revenues O
deriving O
from O
such O
a O
fiscal O
mechanism O
- O
said O
Tortoli B-PER
- O
would O
be O
appropriate O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
they O
would O
be O
used O
to O
finance O
interventions O
aimed O
at O
reducing O

in O
the O
most O
critical O
areas O
" O
. O

Basically O
, O
" O
said O
Tortoli B-PER
, O
" O
it O
would O
mean O
introducing O
" O
a O

The O
so O

called O

, O
i.e. O

, O

not O

, O

" O
the O
undersecretary O
stressed O
. O

In O
order O
to O
arrive O
at O
this O

, O
Tortoli B-PER
highlighted O
the O
need O
for O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
, O
reported O
Tortoli B-PER
, O
" O
has O
already O
been O
activated O

began O
the O

Margherita B-PER

at O
the O

convened O
at O

Sabina B-PER

her O

Elisabeth B-PER
Zanon I-PER
for O
the O
Land B-LOC
Tirol I-LOC
. O

After O
emphasizing O
that O
the O
figure O
can O
be O
read O
as O
proof O
of O
the O
importance O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
gives O
to O
culture O
, O
Councillor O
Cogo B-PER
admitted O
that O
the O
figure O
can O
also O
be O
indicative O
of O
" O
wasteful O
management O
" O
. O

" O
There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
we O
must O
develop O
economies O
of O
scale O
, O
" O
she O
then O
admitted O
frankly O
, O
addressing O
the O
councillors O
, O
cultural O
managers O
, O
and O
museum O
directors O
who O
crowded O
the O
Library O
of O
the O
Archivio O
Storico O
del O

, O
where O
the O
first O
of O
the O
meetings O
promoted O
to O
try O
to O
make O
the O
museum O
system O
of O
the O
Trentino B-LOC
Alto I-LOC
Adige I-LOC
- O
Tyrol O
Euroregion O
a O
single O
network O
was O
held O
. O

In O
many O
European O
countries O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
there O
is O
a O
growing O
tendency O
to O
entrust O
museums O
with O
tasks O
that O
go O
beyond O
the O
mere O
preservation O
of O
collections O
, O
to O
embrace O
the O
broader O
field O
of O
promoting O
cultural O
events O
. O

And O
this O
requires O
territorial O
coordination O
and O
new O
management O
logics O
, O
system O
logics O
. O

This O
is O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
meeting O
that O
the O
three O
cultural O
managers O
of O
the O
Rovereto B-LOC
- O
Innsbruck B-LOC
axis O
have O
organized O
to O
study O
forms O
of O

. O

It O
must O
be O
said O
at O
once O
that O
both O
Zanon B-PER
and O
Kasslatter B-PER
Mur I-PER
, O
respectively O
for O
the O
Tyrol B-LOC
and O
South B-LOC
Tyrol I-LOC
, O
look O
very O
carefully O
at O
the O
prospect O
. O

Indeed O
, O
Bolzano B-LOC
wants O
, O
in O
the O
long O
term O
, O
to O
create O
a O
Munich B-LOC

As O
for O

, O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
made O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
problem O
, O
certainly O
not O
secondary O
, O
is O
in O
some O

ethical O

" O

then O

that O

that O

Here O
is O
the O
statement O
released O
last O
night O
after O
a O
brief O
meeting O
: O

" O
The O
' O
executive O
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
of O
Trentino B-LOC
takes O
positive O
note O
of O
the O
new O
method O
of O
political O
and O

comparison O
with O
which O
the O
coalition O
of O
autonomous O
center O
- O
left O
has O
resumed O
the O
' O
activity O
after O
the O
summer O
break O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
the O
executive O
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
notes O
positively O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
coalition O
will O
meet O
in O
the O
coming O
days O
to O
discuss O
and O
explore O
issues O
related O
to O

, O

, O
institutional O
reform O
and O
energy O
. O

In O
short O
, O
so O
on O
. O

It O
's O
a O
pity O
that O
this O
succinct O
statement O
follows O
a O
few O
hours O
the O
publication O
of O
an O
interview O
with O
a O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
never O
so O
fierce O
. O

Yes O
, O
with O
lots O
of O
belligerent O
statements O
for O
the O
respect O
of O
the O
programs O
and O
in O
defense O
of O
the O
" O
idea O
" O
that O
the O
left O
has O
of O
institutional O
reform O
. O

The O
left B-ORG
- O
wing O
Democrats O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
are O
always O
able O
to O
surprise O
: O

As O
soon O
as O
you O
create O
a O
" O
photograph O
" O
of O
the O
Oak B-ORG
, O
here O
it O
dissolves O
. O

You O
think O
you O
have O
placed O
all O
the O
names O
in O
the O
different O
categories O
and O
- O
in O
a O
flash O
- O
the O
castle O
blows O
up O
. O

Truly O
a O
rebus O
without O
end O
. O

But O
was O
n't O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
that O
" O
Follini B-PER
de O
noantri O
" O
who O
called O
for O
the O
respect O
of O
the O
programs O
and O
advanced O
criticism O
on O
the O
institutional O
reform O
and O
on O
the O
research O
reorganization O
project O
? O

No O
, O
now O
it O
is O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
. O

And O
was O
n't O
this O
last O
one O
leading O
the O
party O
of O
the O
pro O
- O
government O
, O
of O
the O
President O
's O
loyalists O
willing O
to O
bow O
their O
heads O
in O
order O
not O
to O
give O
up O
their O
velvety O
armchairs O
? O

No O
, O
nothing O
true O
. O

Now O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
new O
categories O
, O
new O
positions O
, O
further O
ropes O
. O

Certainly O
the O
congress O
of O
the O
Quercia B-ORG
conditions O
a O
lot O
of O
politics O
in O
Trentino O
, O
even O
if O
the O
Honorable O
Gigi B-PER
Olivieri I-PER
is O
right O
when O
he O
says O
that O
" O
we O
are O
a O
circle O
of O
a O
thousand O
members O
, O
and O
for O
this O
we O
must O
look O
beyond O
the O
party O
. O

Yes O
, O
because O
many O
of O
the O
interventions O
of O
these O
days O
can O
be O
read O
as O
" O
adjustments O
" O
in O
view O
of O
the O
renewal O
of O
the O
secretariat O
: O

If O
Cogo B-PER
takes O
a O
position O
against O
Dellai B-PER
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
she O
is O
concerned O
about O
occupying O
the O
space O
of O
those O
who O
believe O
that O
the O
left O
is O
too O
flattened O
on O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
a O
space O
now O
occupied O
by O
Andreolli B-PER
and O
Chiodi B-PER
. O

The O
most O
ironic O
in O
these O
days O
seems O
to O
be O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
, O
who O
is O
getting O
some O
recognition O
: O

" O
When O
I O
said O
the O
things O
that O
now O
supports O
Cogo B-PER
, O
I O
passed O
for O
the O
one O
who O
wants O
to O
break O
everything O
. O

Patience O
. O

And O
what O
a O
regret O
- O
he O
smiled O
yesterday O
- O
to O
hear O
Dellai B-PER
saying O
that O
he O
wants O
to O
give O
back O
centrality O
to O
politics O
and O
parties O
. O

Right O
now O
that O
I O
'm O
leaving O
, O
I O
'm O
almost O
thinking O
about O
another O
term O
. O

For O
the O
congress O
, O
the O
games O
are O
not O
done O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
candidacy O
of O
Andreolli B-PER
and O
Wanda B-PER
Chiodi I-PER
, O
some O
rumors O
concern O
a O
nomination O
" O
of O
guarantee O
" O
to O
the O
role O
of O

that O

For O

the O

Dellai O

" O
But O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
say O
: O

I O
agree O
, O
it O
is O
the O
government O
that O
does O
not O
want O
. O

Because O
here O
we O
are O
introducing O
radical O
changes O
to O
our O
constitutional O
system O
, O
and O
we O
're O
in O
the O
way O
. O

President O
Dellai B-PER
, O
in O
short O
, O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
has O
granted O
you O
only O
half O
a O
request O
out O
of O
the O
four O
you O
presented O
. O

" O
In O
fact O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
there O
was O
a O
commitment O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
government O
only O
on O
half O
of O
the O
first O
issue O
. O

On O
the O
other O
three O
, O
nothing O
. O

The O
minister O
repeated O
several O
times O
that O
he O
was O
not O
far O
removed O
from O
our O
approach O
, O
but O
then O
added O
: O

We O
have O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
at O
the O
political O
summit O
of O
the O
majority O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
've O
brought O
something O
home O
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
there O
is O
the O
government O
's O
commitment O
that O
the O
institutional O
changes O
will O
come O
into O
force O
only O
if O
they O
entail O
more O
autonomy O
. O

But O
there O
's O
a O
catch O
. O

Everything O
is O
subordinate O
to O
the O
national O
interest O
. O

If O
the O
government O
finds O
that O
a O
provincial O
law O
is O
damaging O
to O
this O
interest O
, O
it O
no O
longer O
sends O
it O
to O
the O
Court B-ORG
, O
but O
to O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
which O
is O
a O
political O
body O
, O
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
can O
cancel O
it O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
this O
is O
unacceptable O
to O
us O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
Minister O
wants O
to O
say O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
must O
also O
remember O
that O
it O
is O
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O

" O
The O
concept O
of O
national O
interest O
is O
dangerous O
because O
it O
is O
not O
defined O
. O

It O
is O
so O
vague O
that O
, O
being O
at O
the O
discretion O
of O
political O
bodies O
, O
it O
obviously O
lends O
itself O
to O
possible O
forcing O
. O

Even O
more O
serious O
is O
the O
possibility O
that O
Parliament B-ORG
may O
decide O
to O
modify O
our O
Statute O
of O
Autonomy O
without O
our O
agreement O
. O

The O
Minister O
, O
while O
declaring O
himself O
personally O
in O
favor O
, O
said O
that O
in O
the O
majority O
they O
are O
against O
it O
. O

Calderoli B-PER
has O
also O
rejected O
our O
request O
that O
there O
be O
no O
concurrent O
elections O
. O

Do O
you O
fear O
that O
the O
legislature O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
will O
become O
three O
years O
? O

" O
We O
can O
not O
accept O
that O
the O
Head O
of O
State O
can O
dissolve O
the O
regional B-ORG
council I-ORG
. O

Even O
on O
this O
Calderoli B-PER
has O
not O
made O
any O
commitment O
, O
referring O
the O
matter O
to O
the O
political O
table O
. O

We O
have O
suggested O
defining O
the O
issue O
through O
implementation O
rules O
of O
the O
Statute O
. O

Since O
it O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
agreement O
, O
it O
could O
be O
the O
most O
suitable O
way O
. O

The O
ministers O
showed O
interest O
, O
but O
it O
can O
not O
be O
said O
that O
an O
agreement O
has O
been O
reached O
. O

In O
short O
, O
a O
negative O
balance O
. O

" O
More O
than O
negative O
. O

I O
would O
say O
heavily O
negative O
. O

Even O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
equal O
representation O
in O
the O
new O
Senate B-ORG
, O
the O
minister O
did O
not O
give O
any O
reassurances O

He O
said O
he O
is O
working O
on O
a O
new O
proposal O
for O

Bertoldi B-PER
, O
when O
did O
you O
hear O
from O
Torretta B-PER
and O
Pari B-PER
? O

With O
Torretta B-PER
we O
met O
at O
the O
end O
of O
April O
, O
while O
with O
Pari B-PER
we O
spoke O
via O
chat O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
. O

Did O
they O
seem O
to O
fear O
for O
their O
safety O
? O

They O
told O
me O
that O
from O
Italy B-LOC
the O
situation O
appeared O
more O
serious O
than O
it O
really O
was O
. O

What O
can O
civilian O
volunteers O
do O
to O
work O
with O
a O
minimum O
guarantee O
of O
safety O
? O

I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
precautions O
are O
the O
usual O
ones O
: O

Keep O
a O
low O
profile O
, O
do O
n't O
carry O
weapons O
or O
escorts O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
have O
an O
attitude O
of O
contact O
with O
the O
people O
. O

It O
transmits O
trust O
, O
closeness O
to O
their O
problems O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
form O
of O
security O
. O

The O
new O
element O
in O
the O
kidnapping O
of O
the O
two O
Italian O
girls O
is O
that O
for O
the O
first O
time O
volunteers O
belonging O
to O
non O
- O
governmental O
forces O
, O
those O
who O
live O
in O
closer O
contact O
with O
the O
people O
, O
have O
been O
targeted O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
understand O
. O

It O
leaves O
me O
astonished O
. O

When O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
, O
a O
rocket O
fell O
in O
the O
courtyard O
near O
the O
headquarters O
of O
" O
Un B-ORG
ponte I-ORG
per I-ORG
" O
the O
fact O
made O
me O
a O
little O
perplexed O
, O
but O
I O
was O
reassured O
that O
it O
was O
a O
" O
normal O
" O
shooting O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
however O
, O
perhaps O
my O
premonitions O
were O
not O
entirely O
misplaced O
. O

Where O
did O
your O
concern O
stem O
from O
? O

For O
a O
year O
our O
work O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
went O
on O
well O
. O

But O
since O
March O
of O
this O
year O
, O
with O
Al B-PER
Sadr I-PER
's O
revolt O
in O
Falluja B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
has O
degenerated O
. O

Before O
, O
there O
was O
the O
Islamic O
resistance O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
take O
much O
root O
because O
it O
was O
perceived O
by O
the O
population O
as O
a O
religious O
thing O
and O
brought O
from O
outside O
, O
and O
the O
one O
linked O
to O
the O
old O
regime O
. O

These O
are O
organized O
structures O
that O
operate O
through O
heavy O
actions O
, O
but O
they O
knew O
where O
and O
how O
to O
strike O
. O

They O
know O
everything O
and O
everyone O
and O
have O
never O
attacked O
NGOs O
, O
especially O
those O
recognized O
as O
not O
compromised O
with O
the O
occupiers O
. O

Why O
, O
then O
, O
were O
the O
two O
Italian O
girls O
kidnapped O
? O

My O
first O
supposition O
was O
that O
they O
were O
not O
organized O
criminals O
, O
but O
a O
band O
of O
drifters O
. O

Certainly O
, O
however O
, O
from O
what O
I O
have O
learned O
from O
the O
internet O
, O
the O
possibility O
is O
emerging O
that O
it O
was O
a O
targeted O
attack O
against O
us O
. O

Why O
hit O
an O
organization O
that O
, O
beyond O
any O
ideology O
and O
flag O
, O
is O
deeply O
committed O
to O
trying O
to O
give O
relief O
to O
the O
population O
? O

Probably O
to O
increase O
the O
emotional O
effect O
of O
their O
action O
. O

To O
strike O
an O
NGO O
is O
to O
send O
the O
message O
that O
the O
danger O
is O
global O
. O

I O
would O
not O
exclude O
, O
however O
, O
the O
first O
possibility O
. O

Is O
there O
resentment O
towards O
foreigners O
among O
the O
population O
? O

Up O
until O
last O
January O
when O
I O
left O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
I O
would O
say O
no O
. O

But O
that O
was O
a O
century O
ago O
. O

Then O
what O
happened O
? O

Since O
March O
the O
situation O
has O
changed O
and O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
it O
is O
degenerating O
day O
by O
day O
. O

Revolts O
, O
attacks O
, O
kidnappings O
are O
happening O
daily O
. O

If O
before O
the O
occupation O
was O
accepted O
in O
exchange O
for O
the O
liberation O
from O
Saddam B-PER
, O
then O
a O
new O
fact O
has O
taken O
over O
, O
determined O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
winners O
of O
the O
old O
regime O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
guarantee O
the O
security O
of O
the O
population O
and O
even O
a O
minimum O
of O
services O
. O

In O
short O
, O
there O
is O
no O
more O
Saddam B-PER
, O
but O
people O
still O
live O
a O
life O
of O
hell O
. O

This O
summer O
, O
with O
the O
infernal O
heat O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
there O
was O
no O
water O
and O
light O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
am O
not O
saying O
that O
Iraqis O
support O
those O
who O
revolt O
, O
but O
something O
has O
certainly O
changed O
. O

But O
does O
n't O
anyone O
distinguish O
between O
soldiers O
and O
civilians O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
primary O
target O
is O
always O
the O
American O
troops O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
distinction O
between O
military O
and O
civilians O
, O
between O
NGO O
volunteers O
and O
members O
of O
the O
administration O
offices O
, O
between O
Americans O
and O
others O
. O

... O

Yet O
, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Simona B-PER
Pari I-PER
and O
Simona B-PER
Torretta I-PER
, O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case O
. O

Could O
it O
be O
that O
they O
were O
kidnapped O
because O
they O
were O
women O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

They O
have O
always O
been O
respectful O
of O
the O
traditions O
and O
religion O
of O
the O
country O
, O
never O
going O
around O
without O
the O
veil O
on O
their O
heads O
. O

the O
critical O
points O

The O
unions O
have O
expressed O
concern O

the O
lack O
of O
clarity O
of O
a O
bill O
that O
emphasizes O
the O
rationalization O
of O
the O
management O
of O
costs O
of O
facilities O
, O
equating O
them O
in O
fact O
to O
private O

It O
is O
feared O
that O
they O
are O
less O
services O

decrease O
the O
quality O
of O

assistance O
to O

would O

provides O
for O
an O

nature O
, O
while O
today O
these O
workers O
are O
included O
in O
the O
bargaining O
unit O
of O
local O
authorities O
. O

The O
fear O
is O
that O
this O
may O
in O

lead O
to O
a O
reduction O
in O

already O
considered O

THE O
ANALYSIS O
OF O

always O
a O
goleada O

one O

, O
three O
draws O
, O
15 O
goals O
scored O
, O
one O

, O
one O

. O

These O
are O
the O
numbers O
of O
the O
opening O

of O
the O
Eccellenza B-ORG

The O
only O

on O

and O
the O
scoreless O

between O

But O
to O
look O
closely O
even O
in O
these O
cases O
we O
can O
not O
speak O
of O
sensational O
outcomes O
: O

That O
the O
formation O
of O
Zimelli B-PER
could O
defeat O
Natz B-ORG
was O
in O
fact O
in O
the O
numbers O
since O
already O
the O
past O
year O
it O
imposed O
itself O
on O
that O
field O
with O
a O
roaring O
5 O
- O

and O
that O
its O
offensive O
potential O
, O
already O
amazing O
( O
it O
is O
enough O
to O
remember O
the O
115 O
goals O
of O
the O
last O
two O
years O
) O
, O
is O
even O
more O
raised O
now O
with O
the O
engagement O
of O
the O
interesting O
Romanian O
Ionut B-PER
Alecu I-PER
, O
not O
by O
chance O
immediately O
scored O
. O

Not O
even O
the O
0 O
- O
0 O
of O
Ger O
can O
be O
defined O
as O
impossible O
: O

In O
the O
first O
release O
of O
the O
season O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
a O
team O
with O
the O
ambitions O
and O
the O
means O
of O
that O
of O
Ala B-LOC
is O
not O
able O
to O
put O
under O
an O
incomplete O
and O
revolutionized O
Salorno B-ORG
, O
but O
not O
for O
this O
less O
stimulated O
. O

The O
beautiful O
, O
and O
difficult O
, O
will O
be O
to O
continue O
with O
this O
charge O
of O
motivation O
and O
concentration O
to O
perhaps O
repeat O
( O
history O
has O
had O
similar O
aspects O
) O
the O
miracle O
of O
Comano B-ORG
last O
year O
. O

From O
the O
other O
fields O
, O
the O
most O
significant O
notes O
concern O
Albiano B-ORG
and O
Vallagarina B-ORG
able O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
best O
internal O
turn O
to O
fold O
tough O
rivals O
such O
as O
Rovereto B-ORG
and O
Merano B-ORG
. O

These O
are O
golden O
points O
especially O
for O
the O
absences O
that O
both O
accused O
: O

Mulchande B-PER

Fantelli B-PER

In O
terms O
of O

complains O
that O

the O

, O
is O
a O
touching O
and O
lucid O
film O
and O
tells O
the O
true O
story O
of O
Ramon B-PER
Sampedro I-PER
, O
a O
quadriplegic O
bedridden O
for O
twenty O

, O
who O

A O
fleeting O
movement O
of O
the O

, O
a O
crack O
in O

, O
are O
enough O
for O
Bardem B-PER
to O
open O
a O
world O
, O
to O
arouse O
avalanches O
of O
emotions O
. O

The O
theme O
of O
the O
film O
is O
that O
of O
death O
, O
and O
the O
legal O
battle O
to O
obtain O
permission O
to O
move O
towards O
a O
sweet O

is O
a O
tough O
one O
. O

More O
than O
on O
the O
legal O
and O
civil O
side O
, O
the O

focuses O
on O

The O
need O
to O
renew O
the O
organization O
of O
the O
Trentino B-ORG
Federation I-ORG
of I-ORG

stems O
from O
the O
desire O
of O
the O
board O
of O

, O
who O
commissioned O
the O

, O
to O
adapt O
and O
improve O
the O

, O
will O
verify O
and O
approve O
the O
three O

program O
that O
will O
result O
from O
three O
phases O
. O

The O
first O
is O
that O
of O
listening O
to O
the O
internal O
structure O
of O
Via B-ORG
Segantini I-ORG
, O
and O
the O
external O
structure O
( O
cooperatives O
, O
consortia O
, O
but O
also O
actors O
of O
Trentino O
society O
) O
. O

The O
second O
is O
the O
diagnosis O
that O
will O
lead O
to O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
actual O
program O
. O

The O
third O
is O

dead O

Stefano B-PER

the O
open O

of O
a O
pure O

in O

At O

Frankfurt B-LOC

on O
his O
way O
back O
from O

his O

he O
did O
n't O
want O

lose O
any O

were O
waiting O
for O
him O
at O

" O
Look O
! O

How O
beautiful O
... O

The O
last O
minutes O
of O
my O
Olympic O
race O
... O

Here O
I O
was O
beginning O
to O
realize O
that O
I O
was O
going O
to O
make O
it O
... O

The O
dusk O
gave O
a O
special O
touch O
... O

And O
then O
it O
went O
from O
the O
darkness O
of O
one O
last O
street O
, O
to O
the O
bright O
light O
of O
the O
Panathinaiko O
Stadium O
. O

I O
still O
get O
excited O
now O
... O

And O
when O
I O
crossed O
the O
finish O
line O
I O
shouted O
... O
: O

Great O
! O

" O
. O

My O
weapon O

is O
normality O

Perfect O
. O

But O
would O
you O
have O
imagined O
all O
this O
popularity O
? O

Indeed O
! O
All O
the O
affection O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
, O
that O
now O
surrounds O
you O
? O

" O
This O
yes O
. O

I O
knew O
it O
would O
happen O
if O
I O
did O
well O
at O
the O
Olympics O
, O
or O
even O
won O
. O

Because O
it O
all O
happened O
there O
, O
in O
that O
fantastic O
place O
where O
the O
Olympics O
were O
born O
, O
with O
that O
extraordinary O
climate O
that O
was O
created O
: O

made O
of O
history O
and O
emotions O
. O

And O
because O
it O
was O
the O
last O
race O
: O

that O
counted O
too O
. O

And O
do O
you O
think O
your O
good O
- O
guy O
face O
counted O
? O

" O
Sure O
. O

Before O
Athens O
I O
was O
n't O
a O
character O
and O
few O
people O
knew O
me O
, O
and O
do O
you O
know O
why O
? O

" O
. O

I O
have O
an O
idea O
. O

" O
Because O
I O
'm O
too O
normal O
and O
too O
good O
. O

And O
it O
used O
to O
irritate O
me O
a O
lot O
. O

But O
I O
said O
to O
myself O
: O

No O
, O
dear O
Stephen B-PER
, O
you O
must O
n't O
change O
. O

You O
have O
to O
stay O
like O
that O
, O
because O
that O
's O
your O
winning O
weapon O
. O
" O

That O
's O
right O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
going O
against O
the O
trend O
a O
little O
bit O
... O

I O
'm O
not O
a O
braggart O
or O
a O
braggart O
like O
some O
footballers O
who O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
give O
you O
an O
autograph O
. O

Well O
done O
Stefano B-PER

" O
Thank O
you O
! O

" O

Tell O
me O
more O

" O
I O
'm O
here O

" O

You O
and O
Bordin B-PER
: O

who O
's O
the O
greatest O
? O

" O
Mmm O
... O

Is O
n't O
there O
a O
reserve O
question O
? O

" O
. O

There O
are O
many O
but O
answer O
this O
one O
! O
First O
. O

" O
We O
both O
won O
the O
Olympics O
. O

He O
won O
an O
extra O
European O
. O

I O
won O
one O
more O
World O
bronze O
. O

We O
're O
even O
, O
I O
think O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
not O
finished O
yet O
! O

But O
I O
'm O
ahead O
in O
terms O
of O
performance O
: O

I O
went O
11 O
times O
under O
2 O
hours O
10 O
and O
my O
3 O
best O
times O
are O
all O
better O
than O
his O
personal O
best O
.... O
" O
. O

Have O
you O
decided O
which O
marathon O
to O
run O
in O
the O
spring O
? O

" O
Boston B-LOC
, O
London B-LOC
or O
Paris B-LOC
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
yet O
. O

Next O
summer O
, O
in O
Helsinki B-LOC
, O
there O
will O
be O
the O
World O
Championships O
and O
you O
have O
never O
won O
them O
... O
. O

" O
But O
I O
've O
finished O
third O
twice O
! O

" O
. O

... O
but O
you O
miss O
the O
gold O
! O

" O
It O
can O
be O
a O
goal O
... O
But O
just O
finishing O
on O
the O
podium O
would O
also O
be O
good O
. O

The O
course O
in O
Helsinki B-LOC
is O
a O
little O
less O
demanding O
than O
the O
one O
in O
Athens B-LOC
, O
but O
the O
weather O
conditions O
will O
be O
such O
as O
to O
allow O
a O
faster O
race O
. O

Anyway O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
thinking O
about O
that O
now O
: O

After O
the O
Giro O
at O
Sas O
I O
'll O
close O
the O
shutter O
for O
a O
while O
and O
I O
'll O
go O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
only O
as O
a O
guest O
, O
this O
time O
. O

And O
I O
'll O
enjoy O
the O
city O
. O

Are O
you O
thinking O
about O
the O
Beijing B-LOC
Olympics O
? O

" O
I O
see O
them O
as O
very O
far O
away O
... O

Then O
four O
years O
go O
by O
in O
a O
flash O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
about O
it O
. O

Will O
you O
be O
there O
that O
day O
? O

" O
I O
've O
felt O
the O
pressure O
and O
tension O
of O
going O
for O
the O
gold O
.... O

Now O
I O
want O
to O
feel O
the O
tension O
of O
starting O
as O
the O
defending O
champion O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
will O
be O
there O
. O

I O
like O
these O
important O
vigils O
. O

What O
dream O
do O
you O
have O
now O
? O

" O
Sporty O
? O

" O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
. O

" O
Sporty O
, O
I O
still O
have O
a O
few O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
, O
I O
dream O
of O
being O
happier O
than O
I O
am O
now O
. O
" O

And O
it O
happens O
as O
before O
, O
during O
the O
press O
conference O
: O

On O
Stefano B-PER

pale O
face O
, O
clean O
and O
freshly O
shaved O
, O
a O
bitter O
, O
deep O
crease O
blossoms O
, O
no O
longer O
hidden O
, O
modestly O
told O
; O

in O
a O
whisper O
. O

Left O
by O
his O
wife O
, O
Stefano B-PER
has O
suffered O
like O
a O
dog O
but O
in O
that O
abyss O
he O
has O
found O
new O
strength O
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
I O
dream O
of O
being O
even O
happier O
than O
this O
, O
one O
day O
. O

The O
whole O
world O
has O
been O
celebrating O
you O
. O

" O
But O
the O
best O
compliments O
came O
from O
President O
Ciampi B-PER
: O

He O
kept O
me O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
, O
alone O
, O
talking O
. O

And O
I O
knew O
it O
when O
I O
was O
on O
the O
podium O
in O
Athens B-LOC
: O

I O
knew O
that O
it O
was O
important O
to O
" O
be O
there O
well O
" O
. O

And O
I O
was O
proud O
and O
composed O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
sing O
the O
anthem O
. O

I O
knew O
it O
would O
be O
a O
spot O
for O
me O
, O
and O
for O
Italy B-LOC

and O
for O
the O
sport O

Have O
you O
worn O
Berlusconi B-PER

" O
If O
it O
's O
for O
that O
, O

gave O
me O

The O
truth O
is O
that O

happy O
that O
this O

came O
at O

have O
to O

The O

In O
Bolzano B-LOC
is O
the O
topic O
of O
the O
day O
: O

Two O
Muslim O
women O
were O
forbidden O
to O
bathe O
fully O
clothed O
in O
a O
swimming O
pool O
of O
the O
always O
crowded O
city O

The O
incident O
occurred O
a O
few O
days O

The O
two O
women O
had O
arrived O
at O
the O
Lido O
with O
a O
man O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
children O
. O

While O
the O
man O
and O
the O
children O
were O
dressed O
in O
costume O
, O
the O
two O
women O
were O
dressed O
from O
head O
to O
toe O
in O
long O
tunics O
. O

And O
in O
this O
way O
they O
also O
tried O
to O
get O
into O
the O
pool O
. O

There O
was O
the O
protest O
of O
some O
swimmers O
, O
for O
hygienic O
reasons O
, O
and O
the O
two O
women O
were O
made O
to O
leave O

, O
does O
not O
make O
a O
big O
deal O
out O
of O
it O
. O

" O
My O
opinion O
is O
that O
you O
have O
to O
respect O
the O
rules O
and O
if O
you O
can O
not O
enter O
the O
pool O
dressed O
, O
then O
you O
should O
not O
do O
it O
. O

For O
him O
, O
wanting O
to O
allow O
Muslim O
women O
to O
respect O
their O
religious O
dictates O
, O
there O
would O
be O
another O
solution O
. O

" O
In O
Muslim O
countries O
there O
are O
mixed O
pools O
, O
but O
also O
pools O
reserved O
only O
for O
men O
and O
only O
for O
women O
. O

If O
this O
system O
can O
be O
introduced O
in O
Italy B-LOC
too O
, O
why O
not O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
it O
would O
not O
be O
against O
the O
law O
. O

But O
if O
the O
reserved O
pools O
were O
not O
built O
, O
" O
then O
my O
advice O
is O
not O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Lido O
. O

concluded O

president O
of O
the O
Alto O

council O
and O

for O

as O
well O
as O
equal O
opportunities O
, O
does O
not O
see O
too O
many O
problems O
in O
the O
matter O
. O

" O
The O
question O
has O
two O
aspects O
: O

one O
cultural O
and O
the O
' O
other O
hygienic O
. O

For O
the O
cultural O
one O
- O
he O
said O
- O
I O
remember O
that O
our O
grandmothers O
went O
to O
the O
beach O
completely O
covered O
from O
the O
head O
down O
, O
with O
absolutely O
one O
- O
piece O
swimsuits O
. O

They O
are O
the O
swimsuits O
to O
have O
become O
increasingly O
reduced O
. O

As O
for O
the O
' O
aspect O
of O
hygiene O
just O
provide O
in O
the O
bathrooms O
of O
the O
sinks O
where O
to O
wash O
these O
costumes O
, O
these O
tunics O
, O
before O
entering O
the O
water O
. O

Before O
entering O
the O
pool O
you O
must O
rightly O
take O
a O
shower O
. O

But O
sometimes O
it O
's O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
filters O
. O

Until O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
cap O
was O
mandatory O
. O

The O
mayor O
of O
Bolzano B-LOC
Giovanni B-PER
Salghetti I-PER
said O
he O
was O
perplexed O
by O
the O
decision O
to O
let O
women O
out O
of O
the O
pool O
. O

" O
I O
have O
seen O
women O
bathing O
with O
their O
clothes O
on O
at O
the O
Lido O
in O
Venice O
and O
there O
were O
no O
problems O
. O

If O
there O
were O
no O
questions O
of O
a O
hygienic O
nature O
, O
in O
principle O
I O
would O
be O
for O
not O
introducing O

for O
reasons O

No O

I O

by O

we O
did O

" O

Do O
you O
regret O
it O

" O
No O
, O
because O
words O
have O
a O
meaning O
in O

There O
they O
had O
a O
certain O
meaning O

It O
was O
a O
time O
when O
certain O

had O
yet O
to O

made O
, O
when O

was O
still O
a O
long O
way O
off O

To O
fight O
with O
these O
words O
, O
even O
if O
they O
were O
hard O
, O
seemed O
to O
me O
to O
be O
a O
just O
thing O
. O

Something O
that O
could O
be O
endured O

Today O
, O
you O
are O

president O
of O
Confesercenti B-ORG
and O
a O
prominent O
man O
in O
the O
Chamber B-ORG
of I-ORG
Commerce I-ORG
. O

A O
beautiful O
conversion O
, O
compared O
to O
when O
you O
sang O
: O
" O
We O
are O
workers O
, O
comrades O
, O
laborers O

Do O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
turncoat O
? O

" O
Thirty O
- O
seven O
years O
after O
those O
events O
, O
what O
should O
I O
be O
? O

Still O
a O
demonstrator O
? O

A O
no O
global O
? O

Of O
course O
I O
'm O
a O
different O
person O
from O
then O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
turncoat O
. O

In O
my O
life O
I O
have O
a O
tension O
that O
constantly O
brings O
me O
back O
to O
my O
past O
. O

An O
example O
: O

In O
my O
studio O
I O
have O
eleven O
people O
working O
, O
and O
they O
are O
all O
employed O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
even O
have O
a O
co O
worker O
, O
when O
other O
firms O
do O
n't O
hire O
anyone O
. O

Because O
I O
believe O
in O
certain O
values O
. O

In O
your O
opinion O
, O
is O
consistency O
a O
virtue O
? O

" O
No O
, O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
called O
a O
virtue O
. O

People O
have O
the O
right O
to O
change O
their O
thinking O
if O
they O
are O
convinced O
that O
there O
is O
something O
different O
and O
better O
. O

Consistency O
is O
a O
virtue O
, O
if O
you O
are O
inconsistent O
out O
of O
interest O
. O

Why O
is O
it O
that O
almost O
thirty O
years O
after O
its O
dissolution O
, O
Lotta B-ORG
Continua I-ORG
continues O
to O
be O
a O
very O
powerful O
lobby O
that O
always O
comes O
to O
the O
defense O
of O
its O
members O
? O

" O
There O
is O
a O
link O
between O
those O
of O
us O
who O
have O
gone O
through O
this O
experience O
that O
has O
no O
end O
. O

There O
are O
experiences O
, O
especially O
of O
a O
certain O
period O
of O
life O
, O
that O
remain O
imprinted O
in O
the O
blood O
. O

Let O
's O
think O
about O
what O
the O
Christian O
Democratic O
Party B-ORG
has O
been O
for O
many O
, O
which O
also O
unites O
those O
who O
today O
make O
different O
political O
choices O
. O

But O
it O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
those O
of O
Lotta B-ORG
continua I-ORG
have O
all O
made O
careers O
( O
or O
almost O
): O

In O
newspapers O
, O
in O
politics O
, O
in O
publishing O
, O
at O
the O
university O
. O

" O
All O
no O
, O
some O
. O

But O
it O
is O
natural O
that O
students O
of O
thirty O
years O
ago O
, O
today O
hold O
important O
roles O
in O
society O
. O

What O
should O
I O
say O
, O
then O
, O
about O
Communion B-ORG
and I-ORG
Liberation I-ORG
, O
which O
has O
placed O
all O
its O
men O
in O
key O
positions O
? O

" O
. O

That O
's O
an O
important O
lobby O
too O
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
but O
Communion O
and O
Liberation O
has O
given O
itself O
a O
structure O

an O
economic O
arm O

you O
remember O
what O
Lotta B-ORG

on O
its O

that O
we O

for O

since O
now O
he O
is O
a O
tenant O
of O
the O
Itea B-ORG
. O

L O
' O
institution O
has O
bought O
his O
apartment O
in O
2002 O
, O
when O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
cover O
the O
hole O
of O
14 O
billion O
lire O
that O
had O
opened O
in O
the O
accounts O
of O
CSC B-ORG
. O

" O
I O
learned O
that O
the O
house O
was O
for O
sale O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
' O
96 O
. O

I O
was O
thirty O
years O
old O
at O
the O
time O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
money O
to O
buy O
the O
house O
. O

I O
had O
enough O
for O
the O
down O
payment O
and O
that O
's O
why O
I O
chose O
to O
buy O
from O
a O
cooperative O
. O

Then O
I O
liked O
the O
house O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
saw O
it O
. O

Call O
it O
love O
at O
first O
sight O
. O

It O
's O
an O
attic O
of O
about O
68 O
square O
meters O
and O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
with O
the O
down O
payment O
in O
addition O
to O
a O
fixed O
monthly O
payment O
of O
629,000 O
lire O
for O
fifteen O
years O
. O

I O
did O
my O
math O
and O
felt O
I O
could O
stay O
in O
it O
. O

So O
I O
decided O
to O
buy O
. O

Here O
the O
first O
problems O
began O
because O
when O
I O
asked O
when O
the O
house O
would O
become O
mine O
they O
became O
vague O
. O

They O
told O
me O
that O
after O
fifteen O
years O
there O
would O
surely O
be O
something O
to O
pay O
, O
but O
that O
the O
Province B-LOC
would O
intervene O
politically O
and O
that O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
balance O
would O
not O
be O
excessive O
. O

I O
entered O
the O
apartment O
in O
July O
1996 O
. O

Already O
the O
following O
month O
there O
was O
talk O
of O
debts O
incurred O
to O
build O
the O
building O
where O
I O
lived O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
, O
however O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
few O
million O
. O

We O
went O
on O
like O
this O
, O
in O
uncertainty O
, O
until O
December O
' O
96 O
. O

It O
was O
at O
that O
point O
that O
the O
top O
management O
of O
CSC B-ORG
told O
us O
that O
the O
debts O
hanging O
over O
my O
building O
amounted O
to O
800 O
million O
lire O
. O

In O
the O
whole O
building O
there O
are O
18 O
apartments O
, O
so O
the O
debt O
for O
each O
of O
us O
amounted O
to O
about O
40 O
million O
liras O
. O

Money O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
more O
than O
we O
had O
paid O
up O
to O
that O
moment O
. O

They O
told O
us O
that O
the O
debt O
had O
been O
accumulated O
because O
the O
provincial O
funding O
had O
arrived O
late O
and O
they O
had O
to O
find O
loans O
on O
the O
bank O
market O
. O

We O
verified O
with O
all O
the O
invoices O
that O
it O
could O
not O
have O
gone O
like O
that O
, O
because O
, O
otherwise O
, O
the O
interest O
would O
have O
had O
to O
be O
very O
high O
. O

However O
, O
SCS B-ORG
asked O
us O
for O
20 O
million O
immediately O
and O
another O
20 O
million O
in O
monthly O
installments O
. O

There O
was O
no O
assurance O
, O
however O
, O
that O
they O
would O
be O
the O
last O
. O

We O
decided O
not O
to O
pay O
. O

The O
following O
year O
, O
other O
interventions O
began O
to O
go O
wrong O
. O

The O
situation O
precipitated O
in O
a O
few O
months O
until O
1999 O
when O
there O
were O
already O
four O
or O
five O
billion O
lire O
in O
debt O
. O

In O
order O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
, O
in O
the O
year O
2000 O
the O
top O
management O
of O
CSC B-ORG
asked O
and O
obtained O
a O
third O
mortgage O
on O
all O
the O
properties O
. O

So O
it O
became O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
it O
was O
now O
impossible O
to O
pay O
back O
all O
that O
money O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
2001 O
, O
the O
liquidation O
of O
SCS B-ORG
was O
decided O
, O
the O
debt O
had O
reached O
14 O
billion O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
and O
the O
other O
tenants O
of O
my O
building O
who O
had O
refused O
to O
pay O
the O

. O

A O
comparison O
with O
the O
Italian O

I O
would O
be O

then O
I O
say O
the O

: O

I O
have O
seen O

They O
tell O
me O
about O
Tardelli B-PER

I O
only O
remember O
his O

There O
have O
been O
Albertini B-PER

Giannini B-PER
.... O

Of O
those O
around O

I O
like O

the O

are O
Vieira B-PER

sound O

to O

it O
there O

: O

" O
V√∂ller B-PER

Too O
long O

And O
women O
are O

. O

Recently O
a O
delegation O
of O
the O
Coordination B-ORG

Women I-ORG
of O
Trento B-LOC
met O
with O
the O
Councillor O
for O
Health O
of O

Remo B-PER
Andreolli I-PER
to O
get O
an O
answer O
on O
the O
problems O
raised O
at O
the O
time O
by O
the O
' O
association O
on O
compliance O
with O
Law O
194 O
on O
the O
termination O
of O
pregnancy O
and O
the O
strengthening O
of O
counseling O
. O

One O
of O
the O
serious O
problems O
reported O
was O
that O
of O
very O
long O
waiting O
times O
for O
abortion O
in O
the O
public O
sector O
. O

" O
The O
2003 O
data O
provided O
by O
the O
Department O
- O
says O
a O
statement O
of O
the O
association O
- O
say O
that O
49 O
% O
of O
interventions O
at O
the O
Santa O
Chiara O
Hospital O
is O
carried O
out O
after O
21 O
days O
while O
Villa B-ORG
Bianca I-ORG
makes O
36.2 O
% O
of O
interventions O
within O
5 O
- O
9 O
days O
and O
40 O
% O
within O
10 O
- O
15 O
days O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
the O
private O
sector O
that O
wins O
the O
majority O
of O
interventions O
( O
763 O
out O
of O
1,238 O
, O
equal O
to O
61.7 O
% O
) O
. O

The O
reason O
? O

Most O
of O
the O
interventions O
in O
the O
public O
sector O
are O
carried O
out O
in O
the O
S. O
Chiara O
hospital O
, O
which O
, O
however O
, O
dedicates O
only O
one O
day O
a O
week O
to O
them O
, O
since O
it O
is O
the O
only O
facility O
with O
a O
relatively O
low O
number O
of O
objectors O
. O

In O
other O
hospitals O
in O
Trentino O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
percentage O
of O
objectors O
is O
much O
higher O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
but O
also O
because O
of O
other O
problems O
, O
the O
Coordination B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
urged O
Andreolli B-PER
to O
move O

Today O
, O
in O

committee O
, O
the O
text O
of O
the O
research O
reform O
elaborated O
by O
the O
councillor O
Gianluca B-PER
Salvatori I-PER
will O
be O
discussed O
. O

The O
reform O
foresees O
the O
transformation O
of O
the O
Itc B-ORG
and O
the O
Agricultural B-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
San I-ORG
Michele I-ORG
into O
foundations O
, O
and O
the O
introduction O
of O
greater O
autonomy O
and O
flexibility O
in O
research O
work O
. O

Less O
political O
appointments O
, O
more O
choices O
related O
to O
specific O
expertise O
. O

In O
a O
word O
: O

greater O
transparency O
. O

In O
short O
, O
this O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
inspiring O
principle O
of O
the O
provincial O
reform O
law O
that O
will O
transform O
the O
Itc B-ORG
( O
and O
its O
statute O
) O
, O
destined O
to O
become O
the O
Bruno B-ORG
Kessler I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
, O
in O
honor O
of O
its O
promoter O
. O

" O
The O
complete O
discretion O
of O
the O
junta O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
appointments O
of O
its O
competence O
" O
explains O
the O
councillor O
for O
innovation O
Gianluca B-PER
Salvatori I-PER
. O

" O
This O
choice O
demonstrates O
how O
unfounded O
are O
the O
objections O
about O
the O
risk O
of O
' O
flattening O
of O
the O
autonomy O
of O
' O
institution O
, O
" O
adds O
Salvatori B-PER
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
old O
( O
unwritten O
) O
rules O
on O
party O
appointments O
are O
cancelled O
by O
those O
( O
written O
, O
this O
time O
) O
that O
guarantee O
a O
balance O
more O
consistent O
with O
the O
purposes O
of O
the O
institute B-ORG
now O
, O
and O
then O
of O

Yet O
about O
twenty O

from O
Trentino B-ORG

for O
a O

of O
31 O

In O

without O
a O

What O
had O
happened O
? O

That O
evening O
at O
the O
end O
of O
May O
, O
the O
conductor O
on O
the O
bus O
stopped O
an O
unknown O
person O
who O
gave O
false O
information O
, O
giving O
his O
name O
and O
surname O
as O
Marco B-PER
. O

The O
Trentino B-ORG
Trasporti I-ORG
employee O
did O
n't O
ask O
him O
for O
an O
identity O
document O
( O
on O
the O
ticket O
it O
is O
written O
that O
the O
recognition O
took O
place O
by O
voice O
) O
and O
so O
the O
stranger O
could O
get O
away O
with O
it O
. O

If O
we O
needed O
a O
second O
confirmation O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
young O
man O
on O
the O
bus O
was O
not O
Marco B-PER
, O
here O
is O
the O
report O
in O
which O
appears O
a O
fake O
address O
, O
a O
wrong O
date O
of O
birth O
and O
a O
signature O
completely O
different O
from O
his O
. O

Yet O
at O
home O
the O
fine O
was O
there O
and O
somehow O
the O
matter O
had O
to O
be O
resolved O
. O

" O
The O
controller O
- O
rightly O
complains O
the O
protagonist O
of O
the O
story O
- O
has O
written O
the O
report O
without O
verifying O
through O
a O
document O
the O
truthfulness O
of O
the O
information O
provided O
at O
the O
time O
of O
' O
infringement O

So O
now O
I O
find O
myself O
having O
to O
respond O
to O
a O
transgression O
committed O
by O
another O
person O
who O
, O
however O
, O
in O
voice O
, O
I O
repeat O
in O
voice O
, O
gave O
my O
name O

, O
while O
the O
date O
of O

, O
address O
and O

are O
different O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O

completely O
illegible O

The O

the O
public O

explained O
to O
me O
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
something O
like O
this O
has O
happened O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
the O
City B-LOC
Hall O
, O
they O
let O
it O
be O
known O
that O
a O
similar O
event O
happened O
to O
a O
girl O
from O
Ravina B-LOC
, O
recipient O
of O
five O
or O
six O
" O
jokes O
" O
of O
the O
kind O
. O

The O
risk O
that O
someone O
, O
in O
order O
to O
make O
fun O
of O
a O
friend O
, O
caught O
on O
the O
bus O
without O
a O
ticket O
, O
enjoys O
providing O
false O
information O
, O
is O
unfortunately O
always O
present O
. O

" O
One O
thing O
that O
can O
actually O
happen O
if O
the O
controller O
is O
limited O
to O
voice O
recognition O
without O
checking O
the O
documents O
, O
" O
said O
the O
same O
offices O
of O
Trentino B-ORG
Transport I-ORG
and O
the O
City B-LOC
. O

The O
funny O
thing O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
the O
offices O
that O
notify O
the O
fines O
, O
much O
more O
diligent O
, O
the O
trouble O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
issue O
if O
they O
took O
it O
since O
, O
starting O
only O
from O
a O
name O
and O
a O
surname O
are O
traced O
back O
to O
' O
address O
of O
Marco B-PER
. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
understood O
, O
however O
, O
if O
, O
instead O
of O
Marco B-PER
, O
the O
recipient O
of O
the O
fine O
had O
been O
Mario B-PER
Rossi I-PER
, O
to O
which O
of O
the O
nine O
people O
with O
this O
name O
that O
appear O
in O
the O
telephone O
directory O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
would O
have O
sent O
the O
fine O
. O

Impossible O
to O
know O
. O

What O
is O
certain O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
it O
is O
up O
to O
the O
recipient O
of O
the O
fine O
to O
demonstrate O
that O
he O
is O
uninvolved O
in O
the O
affair O
. O

A O
task O
far O
from O
simple O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
paid O
, O
" O
continued O
the O
father O
, O
" O
but O
I O
've O
lost O
an O
entire O
afternoon O
, O
besides O
it O
was O
vacation O
time O
, O
around O
offices O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
before O
the O
story O
is O
concluded O
will O
pass O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
because O
, O
they O
explained O
to O
me O
, O
to O
cancel O
the O
' O
oblation O
serves O
more O
or O
less O
a O
year O
. O

The O
fact O
remains O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
this O
long O
story O
, O
that O
unfortunately O
it O
takes O
very O
little O
to O
pass O
oneself O
off O
as O
another O
person O
. O

And O
he O
who O
receives O
the O
fine O
at O
home O
then O
has O
a O
hard O
time O
explaining O
that O
he O
is O
not O
the O
offender O
. O

So O
much O
so O
that O
Marco B-PER
, O
who O
is O
not O
too O
upset O
about O
all O
this O
fuss O
, O
feels O
like O
giving O
travel O
controllers O
some O
advice O
from O
the O
" O
high O
ground O
" O
of O
his O
young O
age O
: O

" O
To O

is O

the O

began O
on O
November O
9 O
, O
2000 O
. O

That O
afternoon O
, O
just O
after O
lunch O
, O
the O
woman O
was O
attacked O
for O
no O
reason O
by O
her O
neighbor O
who O
for O
many O
years O
had O
shown O
signs O
of O
mental O
imbalance O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
in O
1979 O
he O
had O
shot O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
neighbor O
's O
house O
. O

The O
aggression O
was O
first O
verbal O
with O
the O
brute O
accusing O
the O
unfortunate O
woman O
of O
having O
attached O
something O
to O
her O
back O
, O
then O
it O
became O
brutal O
and O
violent O
. O

The O
brute O
had O
hit O
his O
victim O
several O
times O
in O
the O
back O
and O
head O
with O
a O
hatchet O
. O

Only O
the O
quick O
reflexes O
of O
the O
poor O
woman O
, O
who O
had O
defended O
herself O
with O
the O
umbrella O
she O
had O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
could O
avoid O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
woman O
was O
hospitalized O
for O
two O
weeks O
, O
first O
at O
the O
Neurosurgical O
Hospital O
of O
Bolzano B-LOC
and O
then O
at O
Santa O
Chiara O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
her O
life O
has O
never O
been O
the O
same O
. O

Physically O
, O
she O
complains O
of O
dizziness O
when O
she O
suddenly O
moves O
her O
head O
, O
she O
complains O
of O
a O
stabbing O
headache O
, O
she O
sleeps O
with O
difficulty O
, O
she O
wakes O
up O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
, O
she O
has O
nightmares O
and O
she O
is O
forced O
to O
take O
psychotropic O
drugs O
. O

Even O
the O
husband O
still O
accuses O
heavy O
consequences O
of O
' O
aggression O
suffered O
by O
his O
wife O
. O

According O
to O
the O
doctors O
who O
examined O
him O
, O
he O
suffers O
from O
" O
a O
chronic O
post O
- O
traumatic O
stress O
disorder O
" O
. O

The O
aggressor O
, O
however O
, O
is O
hospitalized O
for O
years O
in O
a O
nursing O
home O
. O

Now O
the O
assaulted O
woman O
and O
her O
husband O
have O
decided O
to O
sue O
the O
aggressor O
and O
the O
health B-ORG
care I-ORG
company I-ORG
, O
holding O
it O
responsible O
because O
it O
was O
required O
to O
monitor O
the O
man O
who O
had O
been O
suffering O
from O
paranoid O
schizophrenia O
for O
some O
time O
. O

The O
couple O
is O
asking O
for O
total O
damages O
of O
183 O
thousand O
euros O
, O
122 O
thousand O
euros O
for O
damages O
suffered O
by O
the O
woman O
and O
61 O
thousand O
for O
those O
reported O
by O
her O
husband O
. O

In O
recent O
days O
the O
' O
summons O
has O
been O
notified O
to O
' O
Health B-ORG
Authority I-ORG
. O

According O
to O
the O
plaintiffs O
' O
lawyer O
, O
the O
reason O
on O
which O
the O
liability O
is O
based O
is O
the O
failure O
by O
the O
' O
Health B-ORG
Authority I-ORG
of O
the O
' O
obligation O
to O
prevent O
the O
damage O
. O

This O
obligation O
is O
attributable O
to O
those O
who O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
could O
prevent O
the O
' O
aggression O
. O

And O
that O
is O
the O
' O
Company B-ORG
, O
since O
, O
according O
to O
the O
' O
attacked O
and O
her O
husband O
, O
had O
to O
monitor O
the O
neighbor O
since O
he O
had O
given O
several O
times O
signs O
of O
mental O
instability O
. O

The O
aggressor O
, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
facts O
, O
was O
subject O
to O
psychiatric O
medical O
treatment O
by O
the O
health B-ORG
company I-ORG
. O

His O
psychic O
conditions O
, O
characterized O
by O
violence O
and O
aggression O
, O
had O
already O
been O
revealed O
in O
1979 O
, O
when O
he O
had O
fired O
a O
rifle O
from O
the O
window O
of O
his O
house O
at O
the O
house O
of O
the O
neighbor O
who O
was O
attacked O
twenty O
years O
later O
. O

Following O
this O
episode O
, O
the O
man O
was O
imprisoned O
in O
a O
criminal O
asylum O
in O
Castiglione B-LOC
delle I-LOC
Stiviere I-LOC
from O
which O
he O
managed O
to O
escape O
. O

He O
was O
subjected O
to O
compulsory O
health O
treatments O
in O
1980 O
and O
1997 O
. O

In O
1996 O
he O
had O
shot O
at O
the O
carabinieri B-ORG
's O
car O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
attack O
, O
the O
man O
lived O
isolated O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
in O
his O
house O
. O

According O
to O
the O
victim O
, O
however O
, O
the O
health B-ORG
authority I-ORG
had O
never O
done O
anything O
to O
monitor O
and O
limit O
the O
man O
. O

The O
aggressor O
was O
now O
suffering O
from O
a O
real O
persecutory O
delirium O
. O

Precisely O
for O
this O
reason O
he O
attacked O
the O
woman O
accusing O
her O
of O
having O
attached O
something O
to O
his O
back O
and O
then O
accusing O
her O
of O
having O
killed O
his O
rabbits O
. O

The O
pathology O
of O
the O
man O
was O
known O
for O
some O
time O
to O
the O
company B-ORG
and O
to O
the O
mental O
health O
centers O
. O

However O
, O
according O
to O
what O
the O
woman O
and O
her O
husband O
claim O
, O
no O
one O
did O
anything O
until O
the O
attack O
. O

days O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Council I-ORG
has O
been O
blocked O
by O
the O
indefatigable O
obstructionism O
of O
Sergio B-PER
Divina I-PER
, O
the O
representative O
of O
the O
Northern B-ORG
League I-ORG
who O
alone O
continues O
his O
battle O
against O
the O
reform O
of O
the O
rules O
. O

The O
system O
that O
currently O
governs O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Council B-ORG
allows O
a O
single O
councilor O
to O
block O
the O
' O
activity O
for O
entire O
weeks O
: O

" O
It O
is O
the O
demonstration O
that O
this O
regulation O
must O
be O
changed O
. O
was O
the O
disconsolate O
comment O
of O
most O
of O
the O
councilors O
during O
the O
marathon O
of O
Divina B-PER
. O

Quest O
' O
ultimo O
has O
repeated O
more O
times O
its O
objective O
: O

In O
the O
last O
days O
he O
had O
asked O
that O
the O
reform O
of O
the O
groups O
was O
postponed O
to O
the O
next O
legislature O
, O
while O
yesterday O
he O
motivated O
his O
protest O
against O
the O
article O
cut O
- O
filibuster O
. O

Majority O
and O
opposition O
have O
in O
fact O
agreed O
on O
the O
choice O
to O
remove O
the O
councilors O
the O
right O
to O
filibuster O
: O

The O
bills O
will O
have O
to O
be O
voted O
in O
committee O
and O
in O
the O
classroom O
by O
dates O
established O
by O
the O
group O
leaders O
. O

The O
filibuster O
will O
be O
possible O
only O
if O
three O
group O
leaders O
, O
representing O
one O
sixth O
of O
the O
councillors O
( O
six O
) O
, O
oppose O
it O
. O

This O
choice O
- O
according O
to O
Sergio B-PER
Divina I-PER
- O
in O
fact O
cancels O
any O
power O
of O
veto O
to O
the O
oppositions O
, O
which O
in O
this O
legislature O
are O
particularly O
divided O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
those O
that O
the O
Leghista O
counts O
among O
the O
" O
true O
" O
opponents O
are O
only O
five O
: O

Catalano B-PER
, O
Andreotti B-PER
, O
Morandini B-PER
( O
who O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
is O
not O
group O
leader O
) O
, O
de B-PER
Eccher I-PER
and O
himself O
, O
taking O
into O
account O
that O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Carroccio B-ORG
is O
Bertolini B-PER
. O

No O
help O
on O
the O
obstructionist O
front O
will O
ever O
come O
from O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
or O
from O
the O
Udc B-ORG
, O
the O
party O
of O
Marcello B-PER
Carli I-PER
who O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
most O
irritated O
by O
Divina B-PER
's O
obstructionism O
: O

" O
For O
this O
reason O
I O
say O
that O
my O
battle O
is O
a O
battle O
of O
democracy O

can O
not O

conditioned O
by O
the O

The O

the O

if O

Fund O
for O

- O
The O
amendment O
provides O
for O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
fund O
in O
the O
provincial O
budget O
for O
the O
performance O
of O

by O

The O
fund O
, O
according O
to O
the O
proposal O
introduced O
by O
the O
SDR B-ORG
, O
accepting O
a O
solicitation O
of O
Catalano B-PER
( O
Refoundation B-ORG
) O
, O
is O
attributed O
half O
to O
the O
minority O

half O
to O

Each O
group O
will O
have O
to O
indicate O
the O
expenses O
incurred O
and O
the O
studies O
financed O
by O
the O
fund O
. O

But O
with O
what O
money O
will O
this O
fund O
be O
financed O
? O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
for O
this O
year O
, O
as O
Catalano B-PER
's O
agenda O
proposes O
, O
the O
resources O
will O
be O
sought O
from O
other O
items O
in O
the O
budget O
, O
without O
increasing O
expenses O
, O
but O
of O
course O
this O
will O
not O
be O
the O
case O
for O
future O
budgets O
. O

The O
transversal O
agreement O
provides O
for O
a O
new O
table O
on O
the O
staffing O
of O
the O
groups O
, O
allowing O
the O
hiring O
of O
a O
total O
of O
5 O
more O
people O
( O

cost O
250,000 O

) O
at O
a O
level O
equivalent O
to O

( O

) O
. O

It O
is O
also O
proposed O
to O
increase O

by O
25 O

. O

Currently O
the O
employees O
of O

Travel O
- O
Today O
the O
regulation O
provides O
for O
an O
endowment O
of O
about O
6 O
thousand O
reimbursable O
kilometers O
for O
each O
councilor O
. O

Many O
councilors O
, O
however O
, O
do O
not O
use O
them O
and O
do O
not O
ask O
for O
reimbursement O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
the O
groups O
propose O
that O
instead O
of O
dividing O
the O
kilometers O
among O
the O
councillors O
, O
the O
entire O
endowment O
can O
be O
managed O
by O
the O
group O
leader O
, O
who O
will O
distribute O
the O
kilometers O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
needs O
. O

It O
will O
therefore O
be O
easier O
to O
use O
them O
all O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
group O
leaders O
will O
be O
able O
to O
ask O
the O
president O
of O
the O
council B-ORG
for O
other O
reimbursements O
for O
political O
missions O

In O

when O
she O
went O
to O
the O

a O

perhaps O
because O
she O

Pardini B-PER

Aragones B-PER
with O

even O
defined O

The O
wounded O
heart O
of O
the O
tragedy O
, O
however O
, O
remains O
little O
Beslan B-LOC
. O

The O
place O
where O
the O
destiny O
of O
1,200 O
hostages O
plunged O
into O
the O
hell O
of O
the O
battle O
between O
kidnappers O
and O
special O
forces O
was O
consumed O
. O

It O
is O
not O
yet O
known O
exactly O
how O
many O
people O
died O
in O
that O
chaos O
of O
blasts O
and O
explosions O
. O

Sources O
from O
the O
largest O
morgue O
in O
the O
region O
have O
indicated O
a O
figure O
of O
394 O
people O
. O

Certainly O
there O
are O
565 O
wounded O
still O
hospitalized O
, O
more O
than O
100 O
- O
especially O
among O
children O
- O
in O
serious O
condition O
. O

And O
there O
remains O
the O
anguish O
, O
at O
times O
tinged O
with O
desperate O
anger O
, O
of O
those O
who O
are O
looking O
for O
news O
of O
the O
200 O
people O
who O
are O
missing O
and O
could O
be O
among O
the O
wounded O
, O
among O
the O
survivors O
who O
dispersed O
in O
the O
confusion O
following O
the O
assault O
, O
but O
also O
- O
unfortunately O
- O
among O
the O
still O
unidentified O
dead O
: O

about O
one O
hundred O
, O
60 O
of O
whom O
are O
so O
badly O
damaged O
as O
to O
be O
unrecognizable O
without O
a O
DNA O
test O
. O

But O
the O
drama O
is O
that O
the O
total O
count O
of O
the O
dead O
could O
reach O
700 O
. O

Questions O
also O
remain O
about O
the O
terrorist O
commando O
: O

32 O
people O
, O
including O
two O
women O
- O
suicide O

A O
level O
far O
removed O
from O

: O

At O
that O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
record O
result O
( O

345 O

had O
been O
achieved O
thanks O
to O
the O
remarkable O
growth O
of O

guaranteed O
by O
the O

During O
2003 O
, O
the O

amounted O
to O
15.5 O
million O

In O
2002 O
, O
on O

the O

exceeded O
40 O

( O

276 O
% O
compared O
to O
the O

. O

A O
considerable O
part O
of O
these O

came O
from O
Ferrari B-ORG

The O
company O

After O

therefore O
, O
the O

This O
was O
also O
the O
result O

so O
much O
so O
as O
to O
push O
the O

to O
cover O
the O

by O
resorting O
to O
reserves O
and O
to O
the O
reduction O

The O
subsequent O
devaluation O

had O
a O
considerable O
impact O
on O
the O
profit O
and O
loss O
account O
of O
the O

This O
impact O
was O
offset O

also O
the O

I O
started O

( O
even O

in O
the O
first O

against O

. O
) O
and O
I O
hope O
to O
continue O
in O
this O
way O
. O

Not O
so O
much O
for O
me O
as O
for O
the O
team O
that O
is O
competitive O
and O
can O
aspire O
to O
a O
top O
championship O
. O

Let O
's O
say O
that O
we O
can O
aim O
at O
the O
podium O
if O
only O
we O
know O
how O
to O
maintain O
the O
right O
concentration O
and O
condition O
. O

Your O
scoring O
streak O
will O
be O
decisive O
, O
but O
above O
all O
that O
of O
Luca B-PER
Bonazza I-PER
, O
the O
undisputed O
king O
of O
the O
goal O
. O

How O
is O
it O
to O
play O
alongside O
him O
? O

Better O
or O
worse O
for O
those O
who O
play O
the O
second O
point O
? O

Ah O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
about O
it O
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
advantage O
to O
have O
someone O
like O
him O
in O
front O
of O
you O
, O
who O
is O
unquestionably O
the O
best O
striker O
in O
the O
region B-LOC
. O

He O
is O
the O
central O
point O
of O
reference O
and O
this O
already O
creates O
spaces O
and O
facilitates O
the O
task O
of O
those O
who O
have O
to O
insert O
themselves O
on O
the O
sides O
, O
as O
I O
do O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
he O
knows O
how O
to O
bank O
and O
support O
very O
well O
, O
in O
short O
, O
it O
's O
too O
easy O
with O
someone O
like O
that O
. O

But O
with O
his O
goals O
and O
feats O
he O
takes O
away O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
visibility O
. O

And O
then O
he O
beats O
all O
the O
penalties O
: O

Does O
n't O
all O
this O
create O
a O
bit O
of O
envy O
? O

Why O
, O
it O
is O
also O
a O
comfortable O
situation O
. O

If O
everyone O
thinks O
of O
stopping O
him O
there O
are O
more O
opportunities O
for O
others O
. O

As O
for O
the O
penalties O
, O
it O
's O
right O
that O
he O
beats O
them O
, O
he O
's O
a O
specialist O
, O
I O
like O
to O
score O
on O
action O
and O
I O
'm O
fine O
with O
that O
. O

What O
should O
be O
the O
goal O
this O
year O
? O

I O
would O
like O
to O
confirm O
the O
15 O
goals O
, O
that O
would O
be O
a O
great O
success O
. O

It O
will O
be O
tough O
... O

But O
is O
there O
a O
secret O
behind O
your O
repeated O
goals O
? O

Yes O
, O
luck O
. O

Too O
easy O
. O

People O
say O
it O
's O
because O
of O
your O
immoderate O
passion O
for O
Papa B-PER
Winnie I-PER
... O

That O
's O
news O
to O
me O
. O

You O
've O
talked O
to O
someone O
on O
the O

, O
right O
? O

Whatever O
, O
I O
like O
all O
that O
stuff O
, O

, O
reggae O
, O
happy O
sound O
. O

It O
gets O
me O
going O
and O
makes O
me O
play O
better O
. O

Do O
n't O
write O
it O
down O
, O
but O
do O
you O
know O
how O
many O
times O
I O
've O
scored O
after O
a O
night O
at O
the O
disco O
with O
these O
rhythms O
? O

Of O

I O
do O

on O

the O

does O
n't O
he O
? O

Sure O

at O

he O
does O
n't O
overdo O
it O

We O

Who O
will O
win O

If O
I O
have O
to O
name O
just O
one O
, O
I O
'll O

it O

But O
let O
's O
go O
in O
order O

Everything O
was O
born O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
from O
a O
ravishing O
fall O
in O
a O
sleigh O
. O

It O
was O
March O
14 O
, O
1999 O
when O
in O
Pozza B-LOC
di I-LOC
Fassa I-LOC
the O
student O
, O
who O
is O
now O
28 O
years O
old O
, O
fell O
and O
broke O
his O
leg O
. O

The O
young O
man O
was O
rescued O
by O
the O
118 B-ORG
helicopter O
and O
transferred O
to O
the O
first O
aid O
station O
of O
Villa O
Igea O
where O
the O
sanitary O
doctors O
diagnosed O
a O
fracture O
of O
the O
tibia O
. O

The O
following O
day O
the O
patient O
underwent O
surgery O
for O
the O
reduction O
of O
the O
fracture O
with O
osteosynthesis O
, O
that O
is O
applying O
on O
the O
fractured O
bone O
a O
titanium O
screw O
. O

On O
April O
2 O
the O
young O
man O
was O
discharged O
: O

By O
now O
he O
seemed O
on O
the O
way O
to O
a O
rapid O
recovery O
. O

It O
was O
not O
so O
. O

In O
June O
, O
the O
wound O
showed O
signs O
of O
infection O
. O

On O
July O
29 O
, O
1999 O
the O
student O
returned O
to O
Villa O
Igea O
where O
they O
diagnosed O
an O
allergy O
to O
the O
osteosynthesis O
media O
. O

It O
was O
necessary O
a O
new O
intervention O
for O
their O
removal O
, O
followed O
by O
an O
antibiotic O
therapy O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
instead O
of O
being O
resolved O
became O
a O
real O
ordeal O
: O

The O
wound O
did O
not O
heal O
but O
continued O
to O
be O
infected O
. O

The O
patient O
began O
a O
painful O
pilgrimage O
between O
centers O
and O
specialized O
doctors O
in O
Northern O
Italy O
. O

His O
life O
had O
been O
disrupted O
: O

No O
swimming O
at O
the O
lake O
or O
at O
the O
sea O
, O
no O
cycling O
, O
no O
sports O
activities O
and O
not O
even O
a O
full O
shower O
. O

Even O
his O
concentration O
in O
his O
university O
studies O
suffered O
. O

All O
this O
until O
a O
clinic O
in O
Cortina B-LOC
d'Ampezzo I-LOC
, O
specialized O
in O
this O
type O
of O
infection O
, O
correctly O
diagnosed O
the O
problem O
. O

So O
on O
July O
31 O
, O
2002 O
, O
more O
than O
three O
years O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
the O
young O
man O
was O
hospitalized O
again O
and O
underwent O
an O
operation O
that O
proved O
to O
be O
decisive O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
recovery O
was O
not O
immediate O
, O
but O
with O
the O
passing O
of O
the O
weeks O
the O
wound O
finally O
healed O
. O

Today O
the O
young O
man O
has O
completely O
recovered O
the O
use O
of O
the O
limb O
even O
if O
the O
infection O
in O
theory O
could O
always O
return O

The O

had O
very O
good O
cards O
to O

the O
infection O
could O
only O
have O
been O
contracted O
in O
the O
operating O
rooms O
of O
Villa O

where O
in O

something O

the O
dispute O

with O
an O

For O

it O
was O
a O
very O
good O

collect O
over O

" O

Pinter B-PER
: O

but O
it O
is O
propaganda O
to O

that O
they O
encumber O

" O
I O
share O
the O
objective O

I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O

the O
best O

In O

I O
am O
convinced O

we O
must O
start O

on O

contrary O

from O

With O
my O
variant O
to O

Pup O
of O

, O
we O
introduced O
the O
possibility O
of O
creating O
a O
park O
regardless O
of O

forecast O
in O

" O
The O
third B-ORG
commission I-ORG
- O
continues O
Pinter B-PER
- O
in O
' O
95 O
had O
made O
an O
investigation O
on O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
establishing O
the O
park O
" O
Lagorai O
- O
Cima O
d O
' O
Asta O
" O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
petition O
asking O
for O
it O
. O

Even O
then O
, O
we O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
for O
the O
creation O
of O
parks O
, O
the O
will O
of O
the O
local O
realities O
involved O
is O
essential O
. O

And O
already O
then O
, O
as O
now O
, O
a O
debate O
developed O
that O
reveals O
a O
general O
ignorance O
of O
what O
it O
means O
to O
say O
natural O
park O
. O

In O
these O
days O
many O
have O
equated O
the O
park O
to O
new O
constraints O
, O
to O
a O
' O
plastering O
of O
the O
territory O
. O

It O
is O
not O
so O
- O
says O
the O
former O
councillor O
all'urbanistica O
- O
this O
is O
propaganda O
and O
surprising O
to O
hear O
these O
statements O
from O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
' O
Provincial O
Councillor O
for O
Tourism O
, O
Tiziano B-PER
Mellaniri I-PER
, O
who O
proves O
not O
to O
know O
what O
parks O
are O
. O

And O
the O
Sdr B-ORG
provincial O
councilor O
gives O
some O
examples O
: O

" O
The O
Pinzolo B-LOC
- O
Campiglio B-LOC
connection O
is O
partly O
located O
in O
the O
Adamello O
- O
Brenta B-ORG
Park I-ORG
territory O
, O
and O
this O
does O
not O
prevent O
its O
realization O
. O

I O
will O
say O
more O
. O

In O
the O
park O
area O
, O
as O
far O
as O
the O
reuse O
of O
the O
building O
heritage O
is O
concerned O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
do O
what O
can O
not O
be O
done O
elsewhere O
, O
for O
example O
rebuild O
the O
ruins O
. O

The O
former O
town O
councillor O
underlines O
these O
aspects O
to O
say O
that O
: O

" O
The O
natural O
parks O
are O
an O
opportunity O
for O
development O
and O
enhancement O
not O
only O
of O
environmental O
conservation O
. O

" O
Paradoxically O
, O
and O
for O
this O
reason O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
statements O
of O
the O
mayor O
of O
Vallarsa B-LOC
, O
who O
says O
he O
has O
preserved O
an O
intact O
territory O
and O
therefore O
does O
not O
need O
the O
park O
, O
- O
continues O
Pinter O
- O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
is O
preserved O
more O
, O
from O
the O
naturalistic O
point O
of O
view O
, O
a O
territory O
today O
unattractive O
, O
leaving O
it O
as O
it O
is O
rather O
than O
establishing O
the O
park O
. O

" O
We O
do O
not O
understand O
- O
concludes O
Pinter B-PER
- O
that O
the O
park O
is O
an O
opportunity O
for O
development O
, O
it O
means O
keeping O
the O
mountain O
alive O
, O
it O
offers O
new O
opportunities O
, O
it O
is O
not O
only O
environmental O
conservation O

a O

way O

What O
bothers O
me O

personally O
, O
is O
the O
attitude O
of O
arrogance O
that O

assumed O

The O
message O
that O

that O

one O

then O
, O
if O
there O

up O

Costa B-PER

that O
the O
cost O

what O
is O

A O
meeting O
that O
Anichini B-PER
defines O
as O
" O
a O
rather O
positive O
outcome O
, O
so O
much O
so O
as O
to O
hope O

that O

highlighted O
the O
persistence O

under O

for O

I O

the O

not O

on O
the O

side O

it O

up O

the O

serious O

on O

I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
make O
political O

which O
for O

explains O
how O
this O
change O
has O
happened O
: O

" O
With O
Lippi B-PER
's O
arrival O
, O
this O
concept O
of O
national B-ORG
team O
equal O
to O
club O
has O
become O
more O
evident O
, O
more O
concrete O
. O

Before O
it O
was O
n't O
like O
this O
, O
perhaps O
this O
concept O
was O
felt O
only O
in O
the O
final O
phase O
of O
the O
European O
Championships O
in O
2000 O
. O

The O
National B-ORG
team O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
and O
more O
like O
a O
club O
, O
not O
only O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
technical O
management O
, O
but O
also O
for O
other O
aspects O
that O
concern O
, O
for O

, O
the O

the O

the O
rules O

follow O
in O

" O
In O
fact O
, O
everything O
is O
being O
done O
to O
make O
us O
feel O
as O
if O
we O

one O
of O
the O
youngest O
and O
one O
of O
the O
latest O
arrivals O
in O
the O

- O
what O
struck O
me O
most O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
here O
we O
are O
all O
made O
to O
feel O
equal O
, O
all O
considered O
in O
the O
same O
way O
and O
this O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
is O
very O
important O
and O
very O
productive O

methods O
that O
are O

the O

as O
those O
adopted O

for O

, O
we O

Another O
important O
aspect O
is O
that O

it O

something O

" O
But O
the O
problem O

is O
that O

also O
not O

I O
understand O
that O
to O
give O
a O
fine O
on O
the O
word O
of O
one O
that O
can O
be O
, O
as O
in O

up O

those O

there O
are O
no O

We O

all O
be O
honest O

unfortunately O
this O

And O
for O

L O
' O

all O

killing O
of O
two O
specimens O

of O
the O
hunting O
plan O
, O
during O
the O
first O
day O
of O

in O
September O
2003 O
. O

The O
sentence O
constitutes O
an O
important O
precedent O
and O
in O
some O
way O
contributes O
to O
reassure O
the O
presidents O
of O

" O

If O
the O

fever O
leads O

indeed O
to O
exceed O
the O
plan O
of O

the O
responsibility O
can O
not O
be O

The O
judge O
Carlo B-PER
Ancona I-PER
underlines O
in O
the O
sentence O
as O
the O
hunters O
can O
not O
be O
punished O
because O
they O
can O
not O
be O
informed O
in O
real O
time O
about O
the O
culling O

Similarly O
, O
the O
president O
can O
not O
be O
punished O
, O
as O
he O
has O
no O
tools O
to O
prevent O
the O
' O
killing O
of O
animals O

excess O

Hypothesis O
rejected O
by O
the O

point O

it O

very O

" O
I O

a O
good O

of O

" O
he O
explains O

Bordato B-PER
has O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
deal O
with O
many O
people O
, O
who O
like O
everyone O
were O
shocked O
by O
the O
latest O
violence O

" O
They O
follow O
with O
a O
certain O
skepticism O
the O
news O
broadcasted O
on O
television O

They O
do O
not O
believe O
all O
the O

coming O
from O

all O

with O

He O
explains O
that O
in O
Russia B-LOC
is O
experiencing O
a O
kind O
of O
" O
September O
11 O
effect O
" O
. O

" O
People O
are O
angry O
and O
hurt O
because O
it O
is O
also O
an O
attack O
from O
outside O
: O

more O
than O
30 O
% O
of O
the O
terrorists O
were O
foreigners O
, O
Arabs O
and O
others O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
should O
not O
underestimate O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
terrorist O
action O
was O
carried O
out O
on O
the O
first O
day O
of O
school O
, O
which O
here O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
national O
holiday O
attended O
by O
parents O

grandparents O
and O
all O
relatives O
. O

He O
says O
that O
, O
in O
reality O
, O
the O
comparison O
with O
the O
American O
case O
can O
only O
be O
useful O
to O
simplify O
a O
situation O
that O
can O
not O
be O
explained O
in O
a O
few O
words O
: O

" O
The O
one O
in O

was O
an O
act O
of O

" O
, O

another O

The O

has O
been O
going O
on O

ten O
years O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
really O
understand O
by O
whom O
all O
that O
we O
have O
witnessed O
was O
conceived O
. O

According O
to O
Bordato B-PER
, O
the O
first O
effect O
created O
was O
a O
rapprochement O
between O
the O
population O

She O
continues O
to O
make O
appeals O
to O
unity O
: O
" O
We O
are O
what O

we O

In O
order O
to O
understand O
how O
the O

think O
, O
we O
have O
to O
enter O
their O
perspective O

For O
them O
the O

be O
as O
far O
as O

Perhaps O
the O
attack O
in O
Ossetia B-LOC

symbolic O

One O
of O
the O
most O
important O

The O
path O
on O

he O
was O
with O
Debiasi B-PER

a O
strong O
slope O

Probably O
the O

Yesterday O
at O

just O
to O

you O
an O
idea O

practically O
full O

perhaps O
hoping O
that O
Sergio B-PER

collapse O

No O
, O
no O
one O
wished O
the O

But O
, O
in O
short O
, O
with O
the O
hope O
that O
the O
Leghista O
would O
run O
out O
of O
battery O
behind O
his O
back O
, O
that O
he O
would O
go O
home O
and O
that O
it O
would O
therefore O
be O
possible O
to O
approve O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
- O
and O
darkness O
can O
obscure O
even O
the O
cruellest O
of O
misdeeds O
- O
the O
reform O

above O
all O
the O
much O
longed O

for O
reform O
of O
the O
consiliar O

Here O
, O
Sergio B-PER

trying O
to O
block O
these O
two O

Opposed O
across O
the O

The O
two O

weighed O
down O

two O

one O

Sergio B-PER

five O

moment O

After O
the O

Seven O

perhaps O
in O

with O
the O

of O
even O

always O

one O
of O

ALENSE B-ORG
- O
after O
the O
brilliant O
preseason O
we O
expected O
a O
start O
launched O
by O
the O
ambitious O
eleven O
of O
Improta B-PER
. O

Instead O
it O
had O
to O
settle O
for O
a O
point O
without O
goals O
and O
also O
without O
too O
many O
recriminations O
. O

However O
, O
the O

can O
console O
themselves O
by O
looking O
at O
the O

for O

. O

The O
Roman O
appointment O
is O
considered O
important O
, O
because O
it O
will O
be O
the O
occasion O
to O
illustrate O
directly O
to O
Calderoli B-PER
the O
concerns O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
related O
to O
the O
institutional O
reform O
. O

A O
reform O
that O
has O
many O
problematic O
aspects O
, O
starting O
with O
the O
system O
to O
be O
implemented O
in O
the O
event O
that O
Parliament B-ORG
decides O
to O
amend O
the O
Statute O
of O
Autonomy O
. O

The O
Constitution O
provides O
that O
the O
" O
Charter O
" O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
Alto I-LOC
Adige I-LOC
can O
be O
modified O
after O
a O
double O
reading O
( O
i.e. O
, O
four O
votes O
in O
all O
) O
by O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
without O
the O
obligation O
to O
involve O
the O
regions O
with O
special O
statutes O
. O

Article O
33 O
of O
the O
constitutional O
bill O
proposed O
by O
the O
center O
- O
right O
states O
that O
the O
Statutes O
may O
be O
modified O
" O
after O
agreement O
" O
with O
the O
Regions O
concerned O
, O
but O
if O
this O
agreement O
is O
not O
reached O
within O
six O
months O
of O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
proposals O
, O
Parliament B-ORG
may O
proceed O
with O
the O
modifications O
even O
with O
the O
contrary O
opinion O
of O
the O
local O
authorities O
. O

This O
hypothesis O
was O
fiercely O
opposed O
by O
Dellai B-PER
and O
Bezzi B-PER
: O

The O
text O
- O
it O
has O
been O
said O
- O
introduces O
" O
a O
series O
of O
serious O
violations O
to O
the O
autonomy O
of O
the O
special O
regions O
and O
autonomous O
provinces O
" O
. O

The O
presidents O
will O
then O
present O
to O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
a O
document O
in O
five O
points O
, O
which O
proposes O
a O
series O
of O
amendments O
to O
the O
text O
of O
the O
law O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
drafting O
of O
the O
new O
Statutes O
, O
a O
strong O
involvement O
of O
the O
Regional O
Councils O
will O
be O
proposed O
, O
not O
in O
the O
start O
- O
up O
phase O
of O
the O
discussion O
in O
Parliament B-ORG
, O
but O
after O
the O
text O
has O
been O
approved O
in O
second O
reading O
by O
the O
Chambers O
. O

For O
the O
presidents O
, O
the O
regional O
assemblies O
must O
have O
the O
last O
word O
, O
contrary O
to O
what O
is O
now O
hypothesized O
by O
the O
reform O
. O

Another O
reason O
for O
concern O
is O
the O
expectation O
that O
the O
elections O
for O
the O
renewal O
of O
all O
regional O
councils O
will O
be O
held O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
that O
of O
the O
federal B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
and O
will O
be O
called O
by O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
. O

This O
- O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
presidents O
- O
would O
constitute O
" O
a O
very O
strong O
lesion O
of O
autonomy O
, O
because O
the O
discipline O
of O
the O
election O
of O
councils O
has O
always O
been O
the O
prerogative O
of O
regional O
laws O
and O
is O
guaranteed O
by O
the O
Statute O
as O
an O
essential O
element O
of O
specificity O
and O
autonomy O
. O

Before O
meeting O
with O
the O
presidents O
, O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
will O
meet O
with O
the O
Italian O
Leghist O
Sergio B-PER
Divina I-PER
. O

Between O
the O
two O
there O
is O
a O
friendship O
consolidated O
by O
many O
years O
of O
militancy O
in O
the O
Carroccio B-ORG
: O

The O
relationship O
has O
been O
particularly O
frequent O
in O
the O
' O
last O
election O
campaign O
in O
Trentino O
. O

Divina B-PER
himself O
will O
present O
a O
series O
of O
requests O
to O
Calderoli B-PER
, O
which O
curiously O
enough O
are O
very O
close O
to O
the O
proposals O
of O
the O
presidents O
of O
the O
regions O
. O

Among O
these O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
" O
always O
" O
the O
favorable O
opinion O
of O
the O
local O
realities O
is O
foreseen O
before O
proceeding O
to O
statutory O
changes O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
request O
that O
any O
form O
of O
autonomy O
wider O
than O
today O
is O
extended O
not O
only O
to O
ordinary O
regions O
, O
but O
also O
to O
those O
with O
a O
special O
statute O
. O

Divina B-PER
does O
n't O
hide O
the O
hope O
to O
bring O
home O
a O
positive O
result O
: O

" O
The O
proposals O
that O
I O
will O
present O
to O
the O
minister O
- O
he O
says O
- O
do O
not O
affect O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
reform O
law O
, O
but O
their O
acceptance O
could O
accredit O
the O
League B-ORG
as O
a O
force O
that O
respects O
the O
autonomy O
, O
as O
well O
as O
change O
the O
' O

a O
note O
, O
the O

exiled O
( O

after O

" O
We O

. O

There O
is O
no O
problem O
, O
we O
will O
surely O
do O
well O

Certainly O
, O
the O
Euro O
has O
given O
a O
very O
strong O
shock O
to O
salaries O
and O
prices O
, O
but O
perhaps O
we O
should O
have O
seen O
this O
thing O
before O
, O
which O
has O
happened O
for O
everything O

According O
to O
Vittorio B-PER
Emanuele I-PER
, O
his O
experience O
in O
this O

period O
has O
taught O
him O
to O
" O

The O

urge O
the O

The O

With O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
opening O
of O

, O
the O
problem O
is O
becoming O
increasingly O
hot O
and O
the O
councilors O
have O
decided O
to O
solicit O
a O
written O
response O
from O
the O

" O
We O
know O

well O

however O
, O
the O

as O
complementary O
purposes O
also O
those O
to O
provide O
the O

an O
adequate O
public O

Therefore O
we O
ask O
that O
someone O
give O
us O
clear O

concrete O
answers O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
since O

Since O
1961 O
, O
until O
last O
year O
, O
the O
race O
has O
always O
maintained O
world O
validity O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
in O
the O
' O
90s O
it O
was O
also O
valid O
for O
the O
Italian O
. O

The O
public O
was O
offered O
rare O
spectacle O
: O

the O
occasion O
d O
' O
to O
admire O
the O
evolutions O
of O
the O
iridati O
big O
ones O
placed O

the O
best O

This O
year O
the O
world O
- O
wide O
appointment O
has O
been O
moved O
to O
Sardinia B-LOC
. O

Sanremo O
remains O
on O
the O
calendar O
for O
the O
penultimate O
round O
of O
the O
Italian O
Rally O
Championship O
. O

Only O
one O
stage O
, O
on O
Saturday O
, O
and O
a O
shortened O
route O
compared O
to O
the O
world O
championship O
. O

But O
the O
historical O
special O
stages O
remain O
, O
such O
as O
San O
Romolo O
, O
Monte O
Ceppo O
and O
Colle O
d O
' O
Oggia O
. O

For O
Renato B-PER
Travaglia I-PER
, O
back O
from O
the O
bang O
at O
Adriatico O
, O
it O
is O
the O
penultimate O
opportunity O
to O
bring O
his O
206 O
Super O
1600 O
to O
the O
podium O
. O

The O
bottom O
, O
asphalt O
, O
would O
be O
ideal O
for O
this O
car O
. O

To O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
Ligurian O
race O
has O
always O
given O
great O
satisfaction O
to O
the O
Trentino O
driver O
. O

So O
, O
is O
there O
a O
feeling O
with O
the O
Sanremo O
? O
" O
It O
seems O
so O
. O

In O
1993 O
, O
we O
won O
a O
splendid O
7th O
overall O
. O

First O
in O
group O
N O
with O
the O
Ford O
Escort O
Cosworth O
. O

The O
validity O
of O
the O
race O
was O
worldwide O
. O

A O
great O
satisfaction O
, O
since O
I O
then O
won O
my O
first O
championship O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
debut O
with O
the O
306 O
Maxi O
. O

" O
True O
, O
in O
the O
' O
98 O
they O
made O
us O
try O
the O
306 O
Maxi O
, O
with O
which O
I O
would O
have O
competed O
the O
following O
year O
in O
the O
tricolor O
. O

It O
was O
imperative O
to O
arrive O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
race O
and O
we O
concluded O
third O
among O
the O
2WD O
. O

But O
we O
took O
away O
the O
great O
satisfaction O
of O
a O
third O
absolute O
time O
on O
the O
special O
Pantasina O
, O
where O
we O
put O
behind O
the O
WRC O
of O
McRae B-PER
, O
Sainz B-PER
and O
Makinen B-PER
" O
. O

The O
following O
year O
Travaglia B-PER
dominates O
the O
tricolor O
and O
participates O
again O
at O
Sanremo O
with O
the O
Maxi O
. O

He O
commits O
the O
only O
mistake O
of O
the O
season O
; O

He O
crashes O
and O
is O
forced O
to O
retire O
when O
he O
was O
eleventh O
overall O

all O
there O
, O
the O

there O
but O
obviously O
we O
were O
not O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
they O
believe O
that O

something O
that O

We O
founded O

of O

Greg B-PER
Zglinski I-PER
" O
All O
winter O
without O

tells O
with O
essential O
effectiveness O
the O
difficult O
elaboration O
of O
the O
mourning O
of O
a O
couple O
who O
lost O
their O
little O
daughter O
of O
five O
years O
died O
in O
the O
fire O
of O
the O
barn O

is O

cold O
winter O
in O

the O

Laure B-PER
has O
withdrawn O
into O
herself O
, O
she O
spends O
her O
time O
crying O
and O
inactivity O
, O
a O
prisoner O
of O
her O
own O
pain O
. O

Jean B-PER
is O
apparently O
stronger O
: O

He O
tries O
to O
keep O
the O
farm O
going O
and O
console O
his O
wife O
. O

When O
the O
insurance O

refuses O
to O
pay O
compensation O
for O
the O
damage O
caused O
by O
the O
irregularity O
of O
the O

when O

hospitalized O
in O

psychiatric O
ward O

is O
hired O
as O
a O
worker O
in O

The O
relationship O
between O
the O
couple O
( O
one O
of O
those O
solid O
couples O
born O
in O
adolescence O
) O
frays O
and O
a O
growing O
distance O
is O
created O
between O
them O
, O
also O
due O
to O
the O
intervention O
of O
one O
of O
her O
sisters O
. O

At O
the O
factory O
, O
Jean B-PER
, O
always O
sad O
and O
taciturn O
, O
befriends O
a O
refugee O
girl O
from O
Kosovo B-LOC
who O
has O
suffered O
violence O
during O
the O
war O
and O
who O
waits O
in O
vain O
for O
news O
of O
her O
husband O
who O
disappeared O
years O
ago O
and O
of O
her O
brother O
who O
survived O
the O
extermination O
of O
his O
family O
. O

The O
young O
woman O
carries O
within O
herself O
the O
weight O
of O
her O
past O
and O
the O
fear O
of O
relating O
to O
others O
. O

But O
the O
common O
and O
absolute O
condition O
of O
pain O
allows O
Jean B-PER
to O
find O
someone O
to O
whom O
he O
can O
confess O
all O
his O
despair O
and O
weakness O
, O
just O
when O
his O
whole O
world O
( O
family O
, O
house O
and O
land O
, O
his O
being O
a O
peasant O
heir O
to O
a O
family O
of O
peasants O
) O
has O
collapsed O
, O
making O
him O
a O
stranger O
; O

Someone O
who O
has O
lost O
everything O
before O
him O
and O
who O
is O
forced O
into O
exile O
. O

When O
he O
collapses O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
his O
wife O
who O
frees O
herself O
from O
her O
own O
anguish O
: O

She O
, O
who O
was O
the O
first O
to O
overcome O
the O
disorientation O
produced O
by O
the O
death O
of O
her O
daughter O
, O
has O
understood O
that O
the O
love O
that O
united O
her O
to O
her O
husband O
is O
enough O
to O
continue O
living O
. O

Constructed O
with O
engaging O
emotional O
intensity O
and O
expressive O
has O
the O
rare O
quality O
of O
addressing O
the O
issue O
with O
authenticity O
and O
with O
an O
approach O
that O
pushes O
the O
viewer O
to O
know O
and O
interpret O
the O
states O
of O
mind O
and O
the O
many O
realities O
of O
the O
different O
characters O
. O

Among O
the O
films O
in O
competition O
, O
it O
is O
the O
one O
that O
we O
personally O
prefer O
so O
far O
. O

Placido B-PER

attempt O
is O
probably O
too O
ambitious O
for O
his O

qualities O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
theme O
of O
what O
remains O
of O
a O
person O
alive O
after O
his O
death O
is O
, O
frankly O
, O
difficult O
and O

authors O
have O
been O
able O
to O
deal O

The O

his O

the O

. O

The O
latter O
asks O
that O
the O
council B-ORG
, O
" O
before O
thinking O
about O
new O
taxes O
" O
, O
comes O
to O
" O
explain O
how O

been O

" O
. O

Bertolini B-PER
defines O
taxation O
as O
" O
inconceivable O
" O
because O
" O
penalizing O
tourism O
means O
penalizing O

" O
I O
want O
to O
understand O
the O

the O
proposal O
- O
ensures O
Gianni B-PER
Bort I-PER
, O
president O
of O
the O
Union B-ORG
of I-ORG
Commerce I-ORG
. O

We O
have O
always O
asked O
that O
there O
was O
not O
an O
increase O
of O
' O
rate O
, O
but O
that O
a O
share O
of O
a O
tax O
or O
generalized O
tax O
on O
the O

allocated O
to O
tourism O
. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
Artisans B-ORG
, O
Flavio B-PER
Tosi I-PER
says O
he O
is O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
principle O
that O
" O
those O
who O
benefit O
from O
tourism O
must O
pay O
. O
but O
is O
at O
the O
same O
time O
" O
contrary O
if O
it O
is O
a O
tax O
for O
all O
. O

It O
does O
not O
make O
sense O
that O
everyone O
pays O
for O
a O
single O
sector O
. O

That O
's O
why O
it O
's O
necessary O
to O

criteria O
for O
a O

contribution O
according O
to O
the O
benefit O
derived O

I O
also O
say O
that O
if O
the O
economy O
of O

has O
to O
pay O
to O
support O
tourism O
, O
it O
would O
be O
right O

This O
has O
been O
announced O
by O
the O
top O
management O
of O
the O
company O
, O
led O
by O
the O
managing O
director O
Paolo B-PER
Rossi I-PER
, O
during O
the O
meeting O
with O
the O
trade O

, O
which O
took O
place O
yesterday O
afternoon O
at O
the O
Assindustria B-ORG
headquarters O
and O
aimed O
at O
defining O
the O
details O
for O
obtaining O
the O
extraordinary O
redundancy O
fund O
for O
the O
workers O
. O

" O
Today O
's O
meeting O
is O
certainly O
a O
good O
step O
forward O
- O
says O
Stefano B-PER
Montani I-PER
, O
of O
CGIL B-ORG
- O
The O
company O
has O
guaranteed O
its O
availability O
for O
the O
redundancy O
fund O
and O
said O
it O
was O
ready O
to O
advance O
part O
of O
the O
severance O
pay O
for O
workers O
, O
to O
reduce O
the O
economic O
hardship O
. O

The O
confirmation O
of O
the O
closure O
at O
the O
end O
of O
February O
, O
moreover O
- O
adds O
Montani B-PER
- O
is O
certainly O
a O
positive O
fact O
, O
they O
are O
two O
months O
gained O
compared O
to O
the O
expected O
. O

The O
plan O
that O
is O
being O
put O
together O
to O
obtain O
the O
concession O
of O
the O
extraordinary O
redundancy O
fund O
, O
and O
that O
presupposes O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
replacement O
activity O
, O
should O
foresee O
the O
intervention O
of O
more O
than O
one O
company O
. O

According O
to O
a O
first O
working O
hypothesis O
, O
all O
to O
be O
verified O
, O
about O
twenty O
employees O
could O
be O
absorbed O
by O
Unifarm B-ORG
, O
which O
, O
the O
only O
one O
to O
do O
so O
officially O
, O
has O
already O
expressed O
its O
interest O
. O

Someone O
in O
more O
, O
between O
20 O
and O
30 O
, O
should O
pass O
in O
force O
to O
a O
second O
company O
, O
with O
which O
they O
are O
still O
in O
course O
the O
negotiations O
, O
conducted O
but O
not O
from O
Lesaffre B-ORG
Italy I-ORG
, O
but O
directly O
from O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
hypothesis O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Cavit B-ORG
also O
comes O
up O
, O
even O
if O
officially O
no O
one O
has O
come O
forward O
: O

" O
We O
are O
evaluating O
the O
feasibility O
of O
this O
option O
, O
but O
without O
any O
commitment O
to O
personnel O
, O
" O
say O
the O
Consortium B-ORG
's O
top O
management O
. O
the O
Consortium O
's O
top O
management O
is O
aware O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a O
number O
of O
executives O
will O
be O
transferred O
to O
the O
Parma B-LOC
plant O
, O
while O
22 O
positions O
will O
be O
filled O
through O
retirement O
and O
the O
" O

" O
. O

With O
these O
numbers O
, O
assures O
the O
' O

all O
' O
Industry O
Marco B-PER
Benedetti I-PER
, O
" O
for O
the O
cash O
I O
do O
not O
see O
major O
problems O
. O

The O
political O
commitment O
of O
Piazza B-LOC
Dante I-LOC
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
considered O
by O
Lesaffre B-ORG
as O
a O
necessary O
condition O
to O
proceed O
on O
that O
road O
. O

While O
negotiations O
were O
underway O
at O
the O
top O
levels O
of O
Palazzo O
Stella O
, O
outside O
a O
group O
of O
Stl B-ORG
employees O
expressed O
their O
dissent O
for O
the O
closure O
of O
the O
Ravina B-LOC

. O

Among O
them O
, O
also O
the O
provincial O
councilor O
of O
Rifondazione B-ORG
Comunista I-ORG
, O
Agostino B-PER
Catalano I-PER
, O
according O
to O
whom O
, O
" O
despite O
the O
assurances O
of O
Dellai B-PER
and O
Benedetti B-PER
, O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
Trentino O
industry O
is O
not O
under O
control O
at O
all O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
trickle O
of O
closures O
we O
are O
witnessing O
. O

The O
Province B-LOC
shows O
that O
it O
has O
no O
ability O
to O
look O
at O
international O
processes O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
accusing O
the O
union O
of O
terrorism O
, O
it O
should O
make O
an O
effort O
to O
understand O
that O
there O
is O
only O
one O
solution O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
: O

Tie O
the O

point O
of O

of O

, O
focusing O
on O
quality O
and O

. O

Catalano B-PER
then O
defined O
the O
closure O
of O
the O
Stl B-ORG
" O
a O
scandal O
, O
given O
the O

, O
which O
the O

has O
assisted O

in O
the O

The O
outcome O
of O
the O

held O
at O

REFLECTIONS O

We O
had O
already O
said O
about O
Ivano B-PER
Brugnetti I-PER
and O
by O
now O
we O
know O
everything O
about O
him O
: O

that O
before O
winning O
the O
Olympic O
title O
in O
the O
20 O
km O
march O
he O
was O
a O
specialist O
in O
the O
50 O
( O
five O
years O
ago O
he O
won O
the O
World O
Championship O
) O
. O

That O
then O
the O
very O
long O
distance O
came O
to O
bore O
him O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
: O

He O
could O
no O
longer O
digest O
it O
. O

And O
after O
the O
30th O
he O
began O
to O
complain O
and O
not O
to O
understand O
a O
thing O
. O

Ivano B-PER

Against O
him O
the O
other O
Italian O
Gandellini B-PER
, O
and O
then O
he O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
take O
it O
under O
leg O
and O
maybe O
he O
will O
escape O
the O
personal O

There O
were O
also O

technicians O
of O
the O
municipality B-LOC
and O
the O
president O
of O
the O
district B-LOC
, O
Alessandro B-PER
Depedri I-PER
. O

In O
the O
meeting O
the O
precise O
will O
of O
the O
technicians O
and O
Depedri B-PER
emerged O
to O
guarantee O
first O
of O
all O
the O
safety O
and O
to O
favour O
a O
functional O
viability O
guaranteeing O
the O
passage O

" O
Rudari B-PER
- O
has O
affirmed O
Mrs. O
Degasperi B-PER
- O
has O
shown O
to O
be O
very O
understanding O
and O
available O
to O
find O
a O
solution O
that O
can O
satisfy O
our O
expectations O
. O

The O
technicians O
instead O
have O
sustained O
that O
however O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
grate O
was O
supported O
also O
from O
the O
mountain O
basins O
, O
that O
have O
declared O
themselves O
contrary O
to O
the O
possibility O
to O
touch O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
canal O
for O
the O
realization O
of O
a O
sort O
of O
step O
. O

But O
what O
is O
less O
liked O
was O
the O
firm O
will O
of O
the O
president O
of O
the O
district B-LOC
to O
want O
to O
cover O
the O
canal O
with O
a O
grid O
without O
being O
willing O
to O
find O
other O
solutions O
. O

" O
We O
are O
convinced O
- O
said O
Alessandra B-PER
Degasperi I-PER
- O
that O
the O
most O
serious O
closure O
is O
right O
in O
the O
district B-ORG
council I-ORG
of O
Sardagna B-LOC
. O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
district B-LOC
itself O
should O
carefully O
consider O
a O
serious O
rethink O
on O
the O
matter O
and O
seek O
new O
and O
more O
satisfactory O
solutions O
because O
the O
road O
is O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
many O
residents O
. O

We O
will O
therefore O
urge O
the O
three O
councillors O
who O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
confront O
us O
in O
the O
public O
assembly O
( O
B. B-PER
Berloffa I-PER
, O
G. B-PER
Zambelli I-PER
and O
R. B-PER
Degasperi I-PER
) O
to O
ask O
the O
president O
to O
put O
the O
issue O
on O
the O
agenda O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
the O
district O
council O
. O

To O
complete O
the O
picture O
, O
the O
promoters O
also O
spoke O
directly O
with O
the O
engineer O
responsible O
for O
the O
mountain O
basins O
who O
confirmed O
his O
willingness O
to O
find O
new O
solutions O

such O

But O

arrived O
, O
you O
can O
not O

Well O
, O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
today O
faces O
the O
fourth O
day O
of O
abstinence O
from O

. O

Since O
he O
is O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
even O
a O
personal O
choice O
becomes O
news O
. O

Those O
who O
are O
used O
to O
seeing O
the O

with O
his O
inseparable O
pack O
of O
cigarettes O
- O
a O
travel O

for O
practically O
a O

- O
could O
find O
themselves O
with O
a O
completely O
different O
president O
: O

in O
a O
version O
a O
little O
more O
healthy O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
Dellai B-PER
himself O
was O
a O
bit O
vague O
on O
the O
motivations O
of O
his O
choice O
( O
just O
to O
stay O
on O
topic O
): O

" O
I O
only O
realized O
that O
I O
smoked O
too O
much O
" O
. O

Is O
it O
possible O
to O
meet O
voters O
, O
participate O
in O
very O
long O
meetings O
, O
write O
the O
budget O
of O
the O
legislature O
without O
resorting O
even O
to O
a O
" O
blonde O
" O
? O

For O
now O
, O
it O
seems O
so O
. O

Since O
four O
days O
, O
the O
president O
resists O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
effects O
are O
visible O
, O
and O
how O
much O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
on O
the O
front O
of O
an O
evident O
nervousness O
, O
which O
yesterday O
accompanied O

for O
the O
whole O

. O

Certainly O

not O

which O
have O
been O
disappointing O
him O
for O
some O
time O
now O
. O

And O
the O
moment O
chosen O
is O
really O
difficult O
: O

First O
, O
the O
closure O
of O

then O
the O

and O

again O
the O

about O
the O

here O
there O
is O
the O
autonomist O

that O

But O
I O
believe O
that O
the O

here O
have O
a O
greater O
institutional O
strength O
. O

A O
greater O
control O

Perhaps O
, O
in O
reality O
, O
we O
can O
speak O
of O
a O
greater O
resilience O
of O
the O
Trentino O
community O
, O
which O
has O
a O
greater O
level O

a O

If O

its O
" O

The O
overall O
structure O
of O
the O
local O
welfare O
system O
, O
which O
includes O
all O
transfers O
( O
unemployment O
, O

, O
educational O
and O

, O
beyond O

, O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
a O

Beyond O
a O
series O
of O
necessary O
adjustments O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
it O
is O
still O
working O
well O
. O

There O
is O
a O
framework O
of O
substantial O
aid O
that O
reaches O
the O
citizen O
. O

Yet O
ISTAT B-ORG
statistics O
have O
spoken O
of O
new O
poverty O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
it O
seemed O
that O
poverty O
levels O
were O
increasing O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
( O
which O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
) O
is O
because O
consumption O
is O
low O
. O

But O
this O
depends O
on O
the O
privileged O
tariff O
system O
, O
due O
to O
the O
intervention O
of O
the O
public O
administration O
. O

The O
Trentino O
people O
spend O
little O
on O
transportation O
, O
school O
and O
health O
care O
. O

The O
Welfare O
system O
covers O
a O
series O
of O
services O
that O
elsewhere O
are O
paid O
for O
by O
citizens O
. O

Think O
of O
the O
loan O
of O
textbooks O
in O
compulsory O
schools O
, O
a O
great O
saving O
for O
families O
. O

Yeah O
, O
public O
rates O
. O

Half O
a O
revolution O
for O
the O
proposal O
to O
raise O
the O
bus O
fare O
to O
one O
euro O
in O
Trento B-LOC
. O

( O
Editor O
's O
note O
, O
Schizzerotto B-PER
smiles O
) O
. O

The O
Milan O
subway O
ticket O
costs O
more O
than O
one O
euro O
and O
is O
valid O
for O
less O
time O
. O

Here O
the O
provincial O
administration O
makes O
use O
of O
a O
public O
budget O
that O
is O
among O
the O
highest O
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O

The O
Lombardy B-LOC
Region I-LOC
and O
the O
City B-LOC
of I-LOC
Milan I-LOC
are O
not O
poor O
entities O
. O

Certainly O
, O
here O
the O
public O
contribution O
to O
the O
per O
capita O
budget O
is O
more O
consistent O
. O

So O
the O
question O
is O
: O

Is O
public O
money O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
adequately O
invested O
? O

My O
feeling O
is O
that O
there O
is O
a O
very O
high O
level O
of O
legitimacy O
in O
the O
local O
administration O
that O
has O
demonstrated O
a O
shrewd O
administration O
. O

It O
is O
perfectible O
. O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
Trentino B-LOC
should O
refer O
to O
Central O
and O
Northern O
Europe O
and O
not O
continually O
compare O
itself O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O

Professor O
Schizzerotto B-PER
, O
when O
the O
provincial O
structure O
is O
preparing O
to O
define O
the O
new O
annual O
budget O
, O
dozens O
of O
departments O
rush O
to O
spend O
sums O
, O
even O
large O
ones O
, O
for O
the O
sole O
reason O
of O
not O
seeing O
the O
funds O
cut O
off O
for O
the O
following O
year O
.... O

I O
say O
that O
compared O
to O
the O
Italian O
context O
, O
the O
overall O
system O
has O
strong O
points O
of O
legitimacy O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
significant O
examples O
of O
waste O
of O
public O
money O
. O

There O
are O
strong O
signs O
of O
prudent O
use O
of O
public O
money O
. O

Therefore O
, O
autonomy O
is O
legitimate O
. O

Why O
take O
it O
away O
from O
Trentino B-LOC
? O

Rather O
, O
let O
's O
see O
similar O
levels O
of O
autonomy O
develop O
in O
the O
national O
field O
. O

But O
this O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
citizens O
should O
expect O
everything O
for O
free O
. O

In O
a O
situation O
of O
reduced O
economic O
development O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
public O
administration O
can O
not O
continue O
to O
support O
all O
the O
needs O
of O
every O
single O
citizen O
. O

The O
need O
arises O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
reduction O
of O
facilities O
, O
commensurate O
with O
the O
economic O
capacity O
of O
families O
. O

The O
bus O
ticket O
from O
0.90 O
to O
1 O
euro O
has O
created O
apprehensions O
and O
protests O
. O

Excessive O
. O

The O
attempt O
to O
raise O
fares O
is O
reasonable O
. O

It O
's O
better O
that O
the O
private O
sector O
pays O
a O
little O
more O
than O
the O
public O
service O
goes O
into O
crisis O
. O

The O
generality O
of O
Trentino O
people O
must O
realize O
that O
we O
are O
living O
in O
a O
less O
favorable O
economic O
situation O
than O
10 O
years O
ago O
. O

And O
the O
private O
sector O
has O
to O
pay O
more O
if O
we O
want O
the O
public O
administration O
to O
continue O
to O
be O
reasonably O
fair O
and O
efficient O
. O

After O
these O
declarations O
of O
love O
, O
can O
you O
point O
to O
any O
flaws O
in O
the O
Trentino O
system O
? O

There O
are O
elements O
of O
widespread O
negativity O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

The O
people O
of O
Trentino O
love O
to O
assert O
their O
difference O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
. O

It O
would O
be O
time O
for O
them O
to O
start O
comparing O
themselves O
with O
Europe B-LOC
, O
with O
the O
best O
of O
Europe B-LOC
. O

Instead O
, O
at O
times O
they O
prefer O
a O
defensive O
, O
provincial O
- O
style O
closure O
. O

The O
call O
for O
diversity O
must O
be O
propulsive O
and O
not O
defensive O
. O

But O
there O
is O
also O
another O
, O
more O
specific O
criticism O
that O
can O
be O
made O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
Trentino O
. O

I O
refer O
to O
investments O
in O
education O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
efforts O
of O
the O
public O
administration O
and O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
growing O
reputation O
of O
the O
Trentino O
University O
, O
private O
investment O
in O
education O
is O
still O
low O
. O

I O
mean O
that O

still O
invest O
little O
in O

In O

for O

This O
is O
the O
first O
comment O
of O
Monica B-PER
Baldo I-PER
, O
one O
of O
the O
mothers O
who O
sided O
with O
N.D. B-PER
, O
the O
math O

teacher O
. O
the O
math O
and O
science O
teacher O
, O
who O
will O
now O
go O
to O
support O
the O
Pigarelli B-ORG
school I-ORG
. O

She O
says O
that O
the O
sex O
education O
lesson O
given O
to O
fourth O
graders O
should O
not O
have O
alarmed O
the O
parents O
: O

" O
The O
teacher O
rightly O
used O
technical O
terms O
to O
explain O
how O
reproduction O
works O
. O

These O
are O
terms O
that O
are O
found O
in O
all O
sex O
education O
books O
dedicated O
to O
children O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
tensions O
between O
the O
teacher O
and O
some O
families O
are O
dated O
. O

According O
to O
Baldo B-PER
, O
at O
times O
the O
teacher O
was O
not O
appreciated O
because O
she O
was O
" O
direct O
" O
. O

" O
But O
the O
working O
method O
- O
he O
adds O
- O
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
class O
is O
very O
lively O
, O
but O
she O
knows O
how O
to O
keep O
it O
. O

Then O
comes O
the O
criticism O
to O
the O
school O
management O
, O
which O
" O
has O
not O
properly O
informed O
the O
parents O
. O

No O
one O
, O
" O
she O
says O
, O
" O
has O
explained O
to O
us O
the O
reasons O
for O
this O
departure O
. O

It O
's O
time O
to O
reflect O
on O
this O
. O

Another O
mother O
, O
another O
family O
worried O
about O
the O
new O
school O
year O
that O
is O
about O
to O
begin O
: O

Chiara B-PER
Stefanini I-PER
thinks O
of O
the O
children O
who O
will O
now O
have O
three O
substitutes O

A O

for O

subjects O

one O
for O

one O
for O

In O
this O
whole O
story O
- O
she O
says O
- O
a O
" O
filter O
" O
( O
the O
management O
) O
was O
missing O
and O
the O
sex O
education O
lesson O
was O
the O
spark O
from O
which O
everything O
started O
. O

N.D. B-PER
, O
the O
teacher O
, O
is O
only O
challenged O
for O
not O
having O
warned O
the O
parents O
of O
her O
intention O
to O
dedicate O
a O
lesson O
to O
the O
subject O
: O

" O
Maybe O
behind O
everything O
there O
is O
also O
her O
poor O
ability O
to O
mediate O
. O

Surely O
the O
children O
will O
be O
affected O
by O
this O
climate O
: O

They O
are O
perfectly O
aware O
that O
their O

has O
been O

in O

Ossetia B-LOC

which O

not O
take O

all O

The O
accusations O
that O
the O
EU B-LOC

are O
mainly O
two O
: O

The O
first O
is O
that O
of O
not O
having O
condemned O
the O
acts O
committed O
by O

In O
this O
regard O
there O
is O

declaration O
of O

of O
September O
2 O
- O
before O
the O
massacre O
- O
in O
which O
the O

declared O
its O
condemnation O
" O
for O
the O
taking O
of O

accompanied O
by O
a O
request O
" O
to O

immediately O
" O
because O

threatening O

traumatizing O

The O
second O
accusation O

that O
of O

while O
reiterating O
his O
personal O
conviction O
in O

opposed O
the O

THE O
SEPTEMBER O

IN O
THE O
HALL O

The O

arrive O
in O

from O
September O
16 O
to O
' O
October O

. O

" O
It O
is O
paradoxical O
that O
a O
constitutional O
reform O
born O
for O
federalism O
, O
risks O
reducing O
the O
autonomy O
that O
is O
already O
guaranteed O
to O
the O
Regions O
and O
Provinces O
with O
special O
statutes O
. O
commented O
President O
Dellai B-PER
, O
just O
after O
the O
summit O
with O
Calderoli B-PER
. O

" O
This O
bill O
radically O
affects O
the O
constitutional O
foundations O
of O
our O
systems O

We O
can O
not O
stand O
idly O

expressed O

Presidents O
Magnani B-PER

" O
The O
meeting O
went O
badly O
, O
" O
said O
the O
council B-ORG
president O
. O

And O
Magnani B-PER
added O
: O

" O
They O
want O
to O
bring O
home O
the O
law O

all O
costs O

do O

BETTER O

CLAUSE O
- O
The O
only O
point O
on O
which O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
gave O
reassurances O
was O
that O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
best O
favor O
clause O
" O
. O

The O
novelties O
of O
the O
federalism O
reform O
will O
apply O
to O
special O
autonomies O
only O
if O
they O
improve O
on O
what O
they O
already O
have O
now O
. O

A O
not O
insignificant O
step O
, O
which O
, O
however O
, O
was O
immediately O
re O
- O
dimensioned O
by O
Calderoli B-PER
when O
he O
reiterated O
that O
" O
however O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
national O
interest O
remains O
in O
force O
, O
which O
also O
applies O
to O
Trentino B-LOC
" O
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
federal B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
could O
annul O
autonomous O
laws O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
national O
interest O
, O
a O
rather O
generic O
concept O
. O

" O
The O
Senate B-ORG
is O
a O
political O
body O
. O
Dellai B-PER
immediately O
objected O
. O

" O
This O
means O
that O
our O
laws O
will O
be O
judged O
by O
a O
political O
body O

THE O
MINISTER O
AGREES O
, O
THE O
GOVERNMENT O

The O
minister O
has O
repeatedly O
stated O
that O
, O
if O
it O
were O
up O
to O
him O
, O
the O
principle O

would O
not O
even O
have O
been O
taken O
into O

the O

for O
it O

Is O
there O
a O

out O

Is O
there O
any O

Pontalti B-PER
to O
give O
up O
their O

? O

Andreatta B-PER
is O
trying O
and O
yesterday O
the O
first O
glimmers O
of O
negotiation O
seem O
to O
have O
opened O
. O

Paolo B-PER
Monti I-PER
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
his O
long O
speech O
, O
was O
very O
clear O
: O

" O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
the O
way O
out O
may O
be O
to O
add O
to O
the O
mammoth O
process O
of O
this O
variant O
a O
few O
days O
of O
reflection O
in O
which O
to O
consider O
needs O
not O
previously O
evaluated O
. O

The O
Patt B-ORG
councillor O
explained O
that O
he O
particularly O
cares O
about O
the O
instances O
of O
the O
productive O
world O
, O
of O
those O
artisans O
who O
have O
asked O
for O
expansion O
areas O
. O

A O
theme O
that O
the O
councillor O
Andreatta B-PER
would O
have O
wanted O
to O
postpone O
to O
a O
next O
urban O
planning O
manoeuvre O
but O
that O
at O
this O
point O
he O
could O
also O
take O
into O
consideration O
. O

What O
is O
certain O
is O
that O
a O
way O
out O
must O
be O
found O
, O
or O
else O
the O
proposal O
will O
be O
sunk O
. O

Someone O
has O
taken O
the O
trouble O
to O
calculate O
how O
many O
sessions O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
analyze O
all O
the O
amendments O
presented O
. O

They O
are O
the O
beauty O
of O
62 O
, O
more O
or O
less O
those O
that O
the O
city B-ORG
council I-ORG
does O
in O
a O
year O
. O

Unthinkable O
. O

For O
the O
time O
being O
, O
the O
council B-ORG
has O
been O
extended O
until O
next O
Wednesday O
. O

Even O
with O
Raoul B-PER
Pontalti I-PER
there O
is O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
possible O
pact O
. O

The O
thing O
that O
interests O
the O
councilman O
of O
the O
National B-ORG
Alliance I-ORG
the O
most O
is O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
suitable O
area O
for O
the O
municipal O
dog O
pound O
, O
which O
will O
have O
to O
move O
in O
a O
short O
time O
from O
the O
farm O
Sembenotti O
, O
destined O
to O
be O
razed O
to O
the O
ground O
to O
make O
room O
for O
the O
new O
junction O
along O
the O
ring O
road O
. O

This O
variant O
has O
not O
indicated O
any O
alternative O
so O
far O
. O

Andreatta B-PER
has O
recently O
declared O
his O
propensity O
to O
propose O
the O
former O
farm O
of O
Camparta B-LOC
, O
which O
in O
the O
past O
had O
been O
discarded O
because O
it O
was O
too O
decentralized O
. O

Pontalti B-PER
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
is O
contrary O
and O
insists O
on O
a O
solution O
in O
the O
valley O
floor O
. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
understood O
if O
there O
are O
margins O
for O
negotiation O
with O
the O
Italian O
leghist O
Giuseppe B-PER
Filippin I-PER
. O

Yesterday O
, O
the O
councillor O
tried O
several O
times O
to O
establish O
a O
contact O
. O

To O
no O
avail O
. O

Nailed O
to O
his O
desk O
during O
the O
council O
meeting O
, O
he O
even O
sent O
him O
a O
text O
message O
, O
proposing O
a O
meeting O
for O
this O
afternoon O
. O

Filippin B-PER
, O
however O
, O
for O
the O
moment O
seems O
intent O
on O
holding O
out O
: O

" O
We O
are O
at O
the O
point O
of O
no O
return O
- O
he O
says O
- O
and O
if O
I O
have O
to O
lose O
face O
I O
prefer O
to O
do O
it O
in O
court O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
discussion O
went O
on O
without O
any O
major O
surprises O
. O

Leo B-PER
Vilardi I-PER
for O
example O
, O
while O
referring O
to O
a O
discipline O
of O
coalition O
that O
decides O
by O
majority O
, O
wanted O
to O
keep O
on O
the O
rope O
the O
center O
- O
left O
postponing O
the O
end O
of O
the O
debate O
the O
decision O
on O
the O
vote O
of O
Social B-ORG
Confrontation I-ORG
. O

His O
main O
fear O
is O
that O
, O
through O
comments O
and O
amendments O
, O
the O
variant O
risks O
to O
be O
transformed O
to O
reach O
different O
conclusions O
from O
those O
proposed O
. O

The O
autonomist O
Alberto B-PER
Pattini I-PER
praised O
the O
climate O
and O
the O
spirit O
with O
which O
the O
planning B-ORG
commission I-ORG
has O
worked O
in O
recent O
months O
to O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
variant O
and O
dwelt O
on O
the O
' O
excellent O
work O
done O
by O
the O
offices O
to O
put O
under O
protection O
a O
series O
of O
historic O
buildings O
of O
the O
early O
twentieth O
century O
architecturally O
noteworthy O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
insisting O
that O
a O
different O
solution O
be O
found O
for O
the O
Steinerian O
school O
, O
the O
green O
Aldo B-PER
Pompermaier I-PER
dwelt O
on O
the O
areas O
for O
subsidized O
housing O
. O

He O
is O
not O
fully O
convinced O
by O
the O
Vela B-LOC
area O
and O
is O
awaiting O
specific O
studies O
, O
but O
he O
also O
regrets O
the O
missed O
opportunities O
in O
the O
past O
: O

" O
At O
Canova B-LOC
, O
600 O
lodgings O
will O
be O
built O
, O
and O
there O
was O
every O
possibility O
of O
finding O
about O
fifty O
for O
the O
cooperatives O
. O

Finally O
, O
Sergio B-PER
Cappelletti I-PER
, O
on O
behalf O
of O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
has O
pointed O
out O
some O
technical O
aspects O
, O
hoping O
for O
the O
modification O
of O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
attics O
, O
removing O
the O
references O
to O
the O
architectural O
coherence O
in O
order O
to O
leave O
full O
freedom O
of O
judgement O
to O
the O

himself O

no O

I O

that O
there O
are O
still O
significant O
concerns O

" O
The O
reform O

he O
continues O
- O
calls O
into O
question O
some O
of O
the O
fundamental O
elements O

, O
it O
is O
worth O

" O
In O

replied O
that O
you O

" O
said O
the O
president O
of O
the O

" O
I O
am O
perplexed O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
can O
find O
a O
concrete O
solution O

My O
impression O
is O
that O
Rome B-LOC
wants O
to O
bring O
home O
at O
all O
costs O
this O

beyond O
what O
may O
affect O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O

not O

it O
. O

And O
this O
in O
a O
delicate O
phase O
of O
our O

in O
which O
there O
is O
the O

Piedicastello B-LOC

A O
Polish O
citizen O
was O
run O
over O
last O
night O
around O
9 O
p.m. O
while O
crossing O
the O
road O
on O
the O
ring O
road O
, O
at O
the O
Opera O
Bonomelli O
. O

The O
man O
was O
rescued O
by O
an O
ambulance O
of O
the O
118 B-ORG
and O
transported O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

His O
conditions O
immediately O
seemed O
serious O
. O

In O
the O
collision O
he O
had O
suffered O
a O
cranial O
trauma O
and O
other O
contusions O
. O

The O
doctors O
have O
reserved O
the O
prognosis O
, O
even O
if O
they O
believe O
that O
the O
man O
is O
not O
in O
danger O
of O
life O
. O

The O
man O
was O
crossing O
the O
ring O
road O
on O
foot O
, O
probably O
to O
go O
to O
the O
nearby O
Opera O
Bonomelli O
. O

He O
did O
not O
see O
a O
car O
coming O
from O
the O
north O
. O

The O
collision O
was O
impossible O
to O
avoid O
. O

At O
the O
guide O
of O
the O
car O
there O
was O
a O
woman O
who O
could O
see O
the O
man O
only O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
. O

Every O
attempt O
to O
brake O
was O
in O
vain O
. O

The O
car O
hit O
the O
Pole O
and O
threw O
him O
away O
. O

Luckily O
the O
car O
had O
slowed O
down O
a O
lot O
before O
the O
collision O
, O
otherwise O
the O
consequences O
would O
have O
been O
heavier O
. O

The O
woman O
told O
the O
traffic O
police O
that O
she O
had O
not O
seen O
the O
man O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
road O
until O
the O
last O
moment O
. O

So O
the O
car O
hit O
the O
poor O
man O
. O

On O
the O
spot O
the O
traffic O
police O
arrived O
immediately O
and O
took O
care O
of O
the O
road O
system O
. O

The O
victim O
was O
rescued O
by O
an O
ambulance O
that O
took O
him O
immediately O
to O
the O
Santa O
Chiara O
hospital O
. O

The O
man O
was O
treated O
by O
the O
doctors O
of O
the O
emergency B-ORG
room I-ORG
who O
found O
numerous O
traumas O
. O

The O
man O
was O
however O
conscious O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
the O
doctors O
believe O
that O
he O
is O
not O
in O
danger O
of O
life O
. O

However O
, O
his O
condition O
does O
not O
allow O
to O
dissolve O
the O
prognosis O
. O

Calderoli B-PER
assures O
: O

" O
The O
amendment O
equating O
you O
to O
other O
regions O
will O
be O
suppressed O
. O

" O
We O
do O
not O
touch O
your O
powers O
. O

" O
No O
one O
intends O
to O
call O
into O
question O
the O
autonomy O
of O
the O
special O
statute O
regions O
and O
autonomous O
provinces O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
' O
amendment O
to O
the O
reform O
of O
federalism O
that O
could O
somehow O
equate O
these O
to O
ordinary O
regions O
will O
be O
deleted O
. O

This O
is O
what O
the O
Minister O
for O
Reforms O
Roberto B-PER
Calderoli I-PER
assured O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meeting O
with O
Dellai B-PER
and O
Durnwalder B-PER
. O

" O
We O
have O
clarified O
our O
ideas O
- O
said O
the O
minister O
- O
. O

The O
government O
has O
shown O
its O
willingness O
not O
to O
touch O
the O
regional O
and O
provincial O
autonomies O
. O

Amendments O
have O
been O
presented O
to O
the O
House B-ORG
that O
would O
have O
entailed O
some O
risks O
on O
this O
point O
. O

On O
most O
of O
the O
issues O
on O
the O
table O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
a O
solution O
can O
certainly O
be O
found O
. O

There O
is O
still O
some O
thinking O
to O
be O
done O
on O
two O
or O
three O
points O
. O

But O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
amendment O
that O
seeks O
to O
equate O
special O
- O
status O
regions O
with O
ordinary O
ones O
will O
undoubtedly O
be O
abolished O
. O

" O
Nobody O
in O
fact O
- O
added O
Calderoli B-PER
- O
intended O
to O
touch O
the O
special O
character O
of O
the O
Regions O
. O

To O
determine O
a O
series O
of O
steps O
that O
were O
necessary O
for O
the O
' O
entry O
into O
the O
new O
system O
, O
we O
went O
a O
little O
further O
, O
that O
is O
, O
we O
went O
to O
interfere O
with O
their O
specificity O
but O
nobody O
wanted O
to O
touch O
. O

" O
So O
- O
Calderoli B-PER
concluded O
- O
will O
be O
touched O
the O
transitional O
provision O
of O
the O
text O
according O
to O
which O
, O
until O
the O
' O
adjustment O
of O
the O
new O
statutes O
, O
the O
provisions O
could O
also O
apply O
to O
the O
regions O
with O
special O
statutes O
, O
respecting O
their O
autonomy O
. O

A O
trace O
of O
seminal O
fluid O
traced O
a O
month O
after O
the O
fact O
on O
the O
Lancia O
Y10 O
where O
the O
violence O
took O
place O
is O
the O
evidence O
that O
has O
allowed O
the O
prosecutor O
to O
obtain O
a O
conviction O
in O
a O
proceeding O
otherwise O
all O
uphill O
. O

As O
happens O
in O
many O
cases O
of O
this O
type O
, O
the O
investigators O
were O
faced O
with O
the O
word O
of O
him O
against O
that O
of O
her O
. O

A O
case O
made O
even O
more O
difficult O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
woman O
had O
reported O
three O
weeks O
late O
. O

The O
twenty O
- O
four O
years O
old O
woman O
from O
Pergine B-LOC
, O
yesterday O
assisted O
by O
lawyers O
Ivo B-PER
Dario I-PER
Gerola I-PER
and O
Maurizio B-PER
Pellegrioni I-PER
, O
told O
of O
being O
blocked O
in O
the O
car O
after O
the O
immigrant O
had O
parked O
in O
a O
dimly O
lit O
area O
. O

L O
' O
man O
would O
then O
groped O
the O
poor O
girl O
and O
then O
masturbate O
. O

The O
suspect O
replied O
that O
he O
had O
limited O
himself O
to O
accompany O
the O
young O
woman O
home O
after O
an O
evening O
at O
the O
disco O
. O

The O
episode O
dates O
back O
to O
March O
28 O
, O
2004 O
. O

That O
evening O
the O
two O
, O
who O
already O
knew O
each O
other O
because O
she O
had O
been O
the O
girlfriend O
of O
a O
friend O
of O
the O
Tunisian O
, O
had O
been O
at O
the O
disco O
. O

Late O
at O
night O
the O
man O
had O
offered O
to O
take O
the O
girl O
home O
. O

She O
had O
accepted O
without O
suspecting O
the O
real O
intentions O
of O
what O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
friend O
. O

After O
the O
violence O
, O
she O
had O
reflected O
on O
the O
incident O
for O
weeks O
, O
undecided O
on O
what O
to O
do O
. O

The O
right O
decision O
, O
that O
is O
, O
to O
file O
a O
complaint O
with O
the O
Carabinieri B-ORG
, O
matured O
only O
after O
20 O
days O
. O

The O
time O
that O
had O
elapsed O
risked O
, O
however O
, O
to O
make O
vain O
the O
investigations O
of O
the O
Carabinieri O
who O
, O
however O
, O
were O
able O
to O
trace O
organic O
traces O
on O
the O
Y10 O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
suspect O
defended O
himself O
by O
claiming O
he O
had O
never O
even O
touched O
the O
woman O
. O

The O
prosecutor O
Paolo B-PER
Storari I-PER
ordered O
the O
DNA O
test O
on O
the O
stain O
found O
by O
the O
carabinieri O
on O
the O
seats O
of O
the O
car O
. O

to O
the O
Veronese O
medical O
examiner O
Anna B-PER
Caenazzo I-PER
. O

The O
doctor O
cut O
out O
a O
piece O
of O
fabric O
from O
the O
seat O
. O

The O
subsequent O
examinations O
dealt O
a O
blow O
to O
the O
credibility O
of O
the O
Tunisian O
: O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
stain O
was O
seminal O
fluid O
, O
perfectly O
compatible O
with O
the O
DNA O
of O
Ahmed B-PER
Mahalouthi I-PER
. O

And O
so O
yesterday O
, O
a O
sentence O
of O
2 O
years O
and O
8 O
months O
was O
handed O
down O
, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
deportation O
order O
. O

Heavy O
hand O
then O
, O
perhaps O
because O
the O
defendant O
has O
not O
given O
the O
slightest O
sign O
of O
repentance O
. O

The O
novelty O

One O

in O

in O

approached O
him O

him O

the O

" O
It O
would O
be O

, O

admits O

Yesterday O
evening O
he O
spoke O
at O
a O
meeting O
in O
Aldeno B-LOC
: O

" O
I O
'm O
here O

agrees O

those O

that O

reached O
the O
" O
worst O
of O

. O

Above O
all O
, O
he O
does O
not O

" O

. O

But O
Lotti B-PER
is O
sure O
of O
one O
thing O
: O

" O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
in O
this O
Russia B-LOC
, O
in O
Putin B-PER
's O
Russia O
, O
we O
have O
n't O
moved O
without O
a O
presidential O
order O
" O
. O

The O
negotiation O
, O
the O
negotiation O
, O
in O
short O
, O
should O
have O
continued O
. O

But O
is O
n't O
there O
a O
risk O
of O
legitimizing O
the O
demands O
of O
any O
extremist O
group O
? O

The O
" O
no O
" O
to O
terrorism O
must O
be O
clear O
, O
clear O
and O
total O
. O

But O
it O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
understand O
that O
there O
is O
not O
just O
one O
: O

There O
are O
several O
of O
them O
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
understand O
what O
kind O
of O
response O
to O
give O
to O
each O
one O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
regions O
for O
which O
it O
was O
born O
. O

Terrorism O
, O
after O
all O
, O
is O
a O
degenerative O
phenomenon O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
terrorism O
is O
Chechnya O
? O

It O
has O
its O
roots O
in O
the O
failure O
to O
meet O
demands O
for O
greater O
autonomy O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the O
Soviet B-LOC
Union I-LOC
. O

Like O
the O
others O
, O
it O
stems O
from O
an O
unresolved O
problem O
: O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
understand O
which O
one O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
it O
is O
necessary O
that O
the O
Russian O
regime O
, O
unfortunately O
I O
am O
forced O
to O
call O
it O
this O
way O
because O
of O
the O
violations O
and O
serious O
crimes O
it O
has O
been O
guilty O
of O
, O
brings O
negotiations O
back O
to O
the O
center O
of O
the O
debate O
as O
the O
Chechen O
population O
is O
asking O
for O
. O

Terrorism O
is O
born O
in O
conditions O
of O
total O
desperation O
and O
Putin B-PER
's O
refusal O
to O
dialogue O
with O
the O
political O
component O
has O
strengthened O
the O
extremist O
fringe O
. O

But O
there O
is O
also O
talk O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
Arabs O
and O
of O
links O
with O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
.... O

In O
my O
opinion O
there O
is O
a O
simplification O
in O
the O
rhetoric O
of O
communication O
: O

We O
are O
waiting O
for O
confirmation O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
Arabs O
. O

And O
then O
it O
is O
not O
necessarily O
that O
this O
means O
the O
involvement O
of O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
. O

I O
repeat O
: O

there O
are O
different O
terrorisms O
with O
different O
aims O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Iraq B-LOC
was O
hit O
because O
of O
Bin B-PER
Laden I-PER
, O
but O
Saddam B-PER
had O
interests O
opposite O
to O
those O
of O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
. O

Thousands O
of O
kilometers O
away O
, O
what O
can O
sensitive O
citizens O
do O
to O
solicit O
new O
approaches O
? O

Massacres O
like O
those O
in O
Beslan B-LOC
, O
but O
not O
only O
, O
can O
never O
be O
justified O
. O

That O
said O
, O
there O
must O
be O
a O
collective O
commitment O
to O
place O
the O
rights O
, O
values O
and O
dignity O
of O
each O
population O
at O
the O
center O
of O
attention O
. O

Also O
because O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
those O
who O
are O
not O
involved O
always O
die O
.... O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
there O
is O
always O
someone O
willing O
to O
finance O
the O
disorder O
and O
from O
each O
conflict O
seeks O
to O
benefit O
: O

in O
Chechnya B-LOC
as O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
or O
in O
the O
African O
Great B-LOC
Lakes I-LOC
region O
. O

In O
concrete O
terms O
, O
therefore O
, O
what O
should O
be O
done O
? O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
are O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
the O
law O
of O
the O
jungle O
and O
not O
of O
international O
law O
applies O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
Chechnya O
issue O
must O
be O
brought O
to O
the O
only O
common O
house O
that O
humanity O
has O
, O
the O
UN O
. O

The O
United O
Nations B-ORG
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
its O
faults O
, O
are O
not O
to O
be O
thrown O
away O
. O

The O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
must O
impose O
a O
mission O
that O
induces O
the O
Russian O
government O
to O
open O
a O
dialogue O
with O
the O
civilian O
authorities O
of O
Chechnya B-LOC
and O
not O
with O
the O
current O
puppet O
government O
that O
is O
the O
child O
of O
phantom O
elections O
. O

Iraq B-LOC
? O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
does O
not O
want O
to O
let O
go O
, O
but O
the O
reasoning O
is O
the O
same O
. O

Prevention O
would O
be O
better O
than O
cure O
. O

We O
should O
not O
always O
respond O
to O
the O
various O
" O
calls O
to O
arms O
" O
but O
say O
enough O
to O
all O
forms O
of O
violence O
. O

The O
European B-LOC
Union I-LOC
has O
asked O
for O
" O
explanations O
" O
on O
the O
Beslan B-LOC
massacre O
... O

The O
EU O
foreign B-ORG
ministry I-ORG
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
did O
not O
speak O
in O
a O
personal O
capacity O
. O

But O
if O
Europe B-LOC
were O
to O
back O
down O
on O
this O
front O
, O
it O
would O
mean O
that O
it O
is O
too O
weak O
. O

Can O
peace O
win O
or O
not O
? O

It O
can O
win O
, O
otherwise O
the O
whole O
world O
would O
end O
up O
like O
Ossetia B-LOC
. O

You O
are O
optimistic O
, O
then O
. O

I O
am O
not O
optimistic O
: O

It O
's O
a O
hope O
. O

Also O
because O
in O
the O
last O
few O
years O
the O
interest O
in O
these O
issues O
has O
grown O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
in O
the O
meetings O
we O
have O
held O
. O

The O

has O
caused O

A O

much O
so O
as O
to O
rediscover O
a O

The O

is O
that O

How O
was O
this O
collaboration O
with O
the O
Team B-ORG
born O
? O

" O
Even O
after O
having O
stopped O
pedaling O
seriously O
, O
the O
passion O
has O
never O
gone O
dissolving O
completely O
: O

After O
participating O
in O
the O
Italian O
championships O
of O
the O
Vigili O
Urbani O
I O
decided O
to O
get O
back O
in O
the O
saddle O
, O
and O
while O
I O
was O
on O
duty O
at O
" O
Gigino O
Battisti O
" O
, O
the O
triptych O
of O
the O
Forti B-ORG

, O
I O
was O
approached O
by O
Andrea B-PER
Martinelli I-PER
, O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Team B-ORG
femminile I-ORG
Trentino I-ORG
, O
who O
proposed O
me O
to O
collaborate O
with O
them O
. O

From O
next O
season O
, O
the O
commitment O
will O
be O
even O
greater O
. O

" O
Exactly O
. O

I O
started O
last O
June O
, O
and O
I O
went O
to O
work O
alongside O
Graziano B-PER
Calovi I-PER
and O
Manuela B-PER
Povolo I-PER
. O

But O
from O
next O
season O
, O
Graziano B-PER
will O
take O
care O
of O
promotion O
and O
public O
relations O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
Manuela B-PER
and O
I O
will O
take O
care O
of O
the O
girls O
. O

The O
girls O
will O
be O
many O
more O
. O

" O
This O
year O
they O
were O
five O
, O
and O
from O
next O
year O
they O
will O
become O
15 O
between O
the O
Esordienti O
and O

: O

The O
new O

will O
arrive O
from O

from O
the O
Giudicarie B-LOC
, O
Vallagarina B-LOC

Val B-LOC

Cembra I-LOC
, O
Rotaliana B-LOC
, O
and O
maybe O
even O
from O
Bolzano B-LOC
. O

A O
beautiful O
commitment O
. O

Sure O
, O
it O
must O
be O
a O
satisfaction O
to O
be O
the O
reference O
society O
of O
the O
entire O
province B-LOC
. O

But O
, O
provocatively O
, O
would O
n't O
you O
be O
happier O
not O
to O
have O
the O
" O
exclusivity O
" O
? O

In O
short O
, O
your O
leadership O
is O
unfortunately O
a O
result O
of O
the O
scarcity O
of O
female O
societies O
. O

" O
In O
fact O
, O
we O
would O
be O
very O
happy O
to O
be O
able O
to O
deal O
with O
other O
realities O
like O
ours O
. O

The O
more O
the O
better O
, O
for O
everyone O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
Team B-ORG
Feminilie I-ORG
Trentino I-ORG
was O
born O
just O
because O
the O
square O
did O
not O
propose O
anything O
to O
the O
girls O
that O
after O
the O
Giovanissimi B-ORG
category O
would O
have O
wanted O
to O
continue O
. O

This O
was O
the O
main O
reason O
why O
I O
accepted O
this O
challenge O
: O

to O
allow O
young O
athletes O
to O
continue O
to O
cultivate O
their O
passion O
. O

However O
, O
accepting O
a O
challenge O
also O
means O
meeting O
some O
unknowns O
. O

Any O
fears O
? O

No O
, O
I O
had O
someone O
about O
the O
numerical O
consistency O
of O
the O
group O
, O
fifteen O
athletes O
together O
are O
not O
easy O
to O
manage O
, O
there O
is O
always O
the O
risk O
that O
there O
are O
disagreements O
or O
misunderstandings O
. O

But O
after O
the O
three O
days O
' O
work O
done O
in O
Lavarone B-LOC
a O
month O
ago O
all O
the O
doubts O
have O
disappeared O

It O

really O
a O
nice O

united O
and O
serious O

broaden O
our O
horizons O

at O
the O

can O

the O

I O
do O

think O
the O
return O
is O

in O
our O
small O
reality O

In O
any O
case O
, O
looking O
also O
to O
Italy B-LOC
in O
general O
, O
it O
could O
serve O
to O
make O

up O

before O
the O

the O

It O
was O
mainly O

who O
- O
perhaps O
for O
fun O
- O
stopped O

provided O
false O

It O
was O
difficult O
for O
the O

to O
verify O
the O
reliability O

For O
Maurizio B-PER
Nichetti I-PER
, O
director O
, O
actor O
and O
artist O
, O
new O
director O
of O
the O
Trento B-LOC
Mountain O
Film O
Festival O
, O
what O
is O
missing O
from O
the O
over O
fifty O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Trento O
event O
" O
is O
a O
wider O
showcase O
" O
, O
which O
would O
make O
it O
known O
outside O
of O
the O
industry O
. O

And O
, O
above O
all O
, O
a O
greater O
role O
for O
the O
city O
of O
Trento B-LOC
and O
Trentino B-LOC
in O
what O
remains O
" O
the O
jewel O
in O
the O
crown O
" O
of O
international O
mountain O
film O
festivals O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
director O
, O
who O
was O
in O
Trento B-LOC
yesterday O
to O
organize O
the O
next O
edition O
, O
met O
with O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
, O
the O
Mayor O
Alberto B-PER
Pacher I-PER
, O
and O
the O
restaurateurs O
. O

" O
I O
will O
do O
my O
best O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
during O
the O
screenings O
the O
whole O
city O
will O
talk O
about O
the O
Film O
Festival O
and O
live O
it O
in O
depth O
. O

Nichetti B-PER
, O
you O
are O
a O
very O
appreciated O
director O
who O
has O
been O
able O
to O
innovate O
the O
Italian O
cinema O
. O

But O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
specific O
competence O
in O
mountaineering O
. O

Why O
have O
you O
been O
chosen O
as O
director O
of O
the O
Mountain O
Film O
Festival O
? O

" O
It O
is O
true O
. O

I O
am O
not O
an O
expert O
mountaineer O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
specific O
competence O
. O

I O
said O
it O
when O
I O
was O
contacted O
last O
June O
14 O
. O

In O
the O
last O
edition O
I O
presided O
the O
jury O
of O
the O
Film O
Festival O
and O
for O
me O
it O
was O
an O
extraordinary O
experience O
. O

I O
have O
been O
part O
of O
juries O
of O
other O
festivals O
, O
from O
Cannes B-LOC
to O
Montreal B-LOC
to O
Venice B-LOC
, O
but O
here O
in O
Trento B-LOC
it O
was O
something O
special O
. O

Among O
the O
jurors O
there O
was O
no O
political O
or O
film O
school O
clash O
, O
but O
they O
all O
deeply O
loved O
the O
mountains O
. O

Let O
's O
see O
if O
I O
can O
give O
more O
visibility O
to O
Trento B-LOC
, O
capital O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O

Although O
of O
high O
quality O
, O
the O
Film O
Festival O
has O
never O
found O
much O
space O
in O
the O
national O
media O
. O

Why O
? O

" O
The O
Trento B-LOC
Festival O
is O
incredibly O
undervalued O
by O
the O
national O
media O
, O
both O
in O
the O
press O
and O
on O
TV O
. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
in O
Italy B-LOC
who O
makes O
it O
known O
. O

It O
must O
surely O
have O
a O
wider O
showcase O
, O
and O
for O
this O
I O
will O
work O
hard O
. O

But O
beyond O
some O
passage O
on O
the O
national O
Tv O
, O
we O
will O
bring O
the O
demonstration O
in O
net O
, O
on O
internet O
, O
making O
it O
usable O
to O
a O
vast O
public O
, O
not O
only O
of O
the O
traditional O
fans O
. O

The O
risk O
at O
times O
is O
that O
it O
will O
be O
reduced O
to O
a O
sector O
festival O
, O
for O
a O
few O
professionals O
. O

" O
It O
's O
a O
risk O
we O
have O
to O
avoid O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
while O
preserving O
the O
style O
of O
the O
festival O
, O
we O
must O
reach O
a O
wider O
audience O
, O
and O
a O
greater O
visibility O
outside O
the O
city O
. O

Last O
year O
, O
going O
around O
Trento B-LOC
, O
I O
had O
the O
perception O
that O
the O
festival O
was O
in O
a O
non O
- O
place O
, O
the O
city O
did O
n't O
feel O
it O
as O
its O
own O
. O

What O
projects O
do O
you O
have O
in O
mind O
? O

" O
It O
is O
necessary O
that O
during O
the O
week O
of O
the O
festival O
the O
restaurants O
organize O
thematic O
initiatives O
, O
the O
schools O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
participate O
in O
the O
screenings O
, O
the O
squares O
of O
Trento B-LOC
involve O
people O
in O
the O
Film O
Festival O
. O

I O
'm O
thinking O
of O
a O
projection O
in O
Piazza B-LOC
Dante I-LOC
or O
Piazza B-LOC
Battisti I-LOC
. O

Then O
there O
would O
be O
screenings O
in O
theaters O
, O
by O
subject O
. O

Retrospectives O
in O
one O
room O
. O

In O
another O
, O
films O
for O
children O
. O

In O
the O
other O
, O
the O
films O
of O
the O
historical O
archives O
of O
fifty O
years O
of O
the O
Film O
Festival O
. O

Not O
everyone O
liked O
the O
screenings O
in O
the O
theaters O
. O

Some O
regretted O
the O
auditorium O
. O

Will O
the O
festival O
return O
to O
the O
S. O
Chiara O
? O

" O
For O
me O
, O
it O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
bring O
the O
screenings O
into O
the O
city O
. O

You O
can O
also O
bring O
them O
back O
to O
the O
auditorium O
, O
but O
it O
must O
n't O
become O
something O
self O
- O
referential O
for O
a O
caste O
of O
initiates O

The O

yesterday O

In O

, O
the O

immediately O
solicited O

obtained O

thanks O

The O
religious O
leaders O
strongly O
condemned O
the O

and O
called O
for O
the O
immediate O

of O
the O
two O

The O
signatories O

condemned O

, O
in O
the O

But O
the O
government O
believes O
that O
a O
choral O
reaction O
of O
the O
country O
, O
involving O
all O
political O
forces O
, O
is O
fundamental O
. O

A O
concept O
that O
, O
according O
to O
what O
has O
been O

was O
remarked O
during O

reiterated O
in O

not O
run O
the O

available O
for O
each O
role O
. O

So O
there O
is O
the O
possibility O
to O
choose O
, O
taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
form O
and O
situations O
of O
the O
moment O
. O

Returning O
to O
the O
Giallobl√π O
after O
12 O
years O
; O

At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
called O
Trento O
. O

" O
I O
came O
from O
the O
Primavera B-ORG
of O
Verona B-ORG
and O
for O
me O
it O
was O
a O
bet O
: O

I O
had O
to O
understand O
if O
I O
would O
have O
been O
a O
footballer O
or O
not O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
enough O
to O
meet O
a O
coach O
like O
Cavasin B-PER
who O
gave O
me O
confidence O
by O
making O
me O
play O
as O
a O
starter O
and O
taught O
me O
a O
lot O
. O

And O
now O
back O
to O
Trento B-LOC
, O
because O
from O
Pescantina B-LOC
- O
where O
Migliorini B-PER
lives O
with O
Mrs. O
Barbara B-PER
and O
the O
little O
Christian B-PER
( O
almost O
two O
years O
old O
) O
and O
Andrea B-PER
( O
2 O
months O
) O
- O
in O
a O
moment O
you O
are O
at O
the O
Briamasco O
; O

And O
then O
there O
is O
the O
company O
of O
Christian B-PER
Soave I-PER
, O
in O
the O
car O
. O

" O
Yesterday O
, O
the O
one O
who O
was O
most O
sorry O
for O
what O
happened O
at O
the O
end O
was O
him O
. O

But O
he O
had O
made O
a O
pact O
with O
his O
son O
and O
he O
had O
to O
show O
that O
" O
Z O
" O
on O
his O
shirt O
. O

It O
was O
a O
mistake O
, O
I O
agree O
; O

Maybe O
he O
did O
n't O
remember O
that O
he O
had O
been O
cautioned O
before O
. O

As O
I O
said O
, O
however O
, O
ours O
is O
a O
team O
in O
which O
all O
of O
us O
are O
starters O
: O

One O
comes O
out O
and O
the O
one O
who O
comes O
in O
does O
his O
part O
better O
. O

Like O
Sunday O

Maraner B-PER

on O

, O
expresses O
a O
wish O

So O
he O
fishes O
from O
the O
bench O
the O
" O
Aladdin B-PER

" O
. O
A O
little O
rub O
, O
and O
the O
desire O
, O
obviously O
, O
comes O
true O
immediately O
. O

That O
of O
Migliorini B-PER
, O
instead O
? O

" O
Well O
. O

We O
have O
what O
it O
takes O
to O
be O
able O
to O
aim O
at O
the O
goal O
that O
the O
society O
has O
set O
. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O

In O
return O
, O
hoping O
he O
wo O
n't O
say O
it O
.... O
" O
That O
is O
... O
To O
be O
protagonists O
in O
the O

. O

Danger O
averted O
; O

The O
rest O
comes O
by O
itself O
. O

With O
the O
game O
and O
the O
ideas O
, O
but O
also O
maybe O
the O
goals O
of O
Migliorini B-PER
: O

Every O
now O
and O
then O
he O
scores O
as O
well O
. O

" O
Always O
from O
outside O
the O

I O
finish O

the O
seventh O
edition O
of O
this O

organized O
by O
Radio B-ORG

has O
demonstrated O
the O
thirst O
for O
events O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Trentino O
public O
and O
the O
desire O
to O
experience O
moments O

this O

Moments O
like O
the O
one O
linked O
to O
Daniele B-PER
Groff I-PER
: O

every O
return O
to O
his O
city O
obviously O
has O
a O
special O
flavor O
and O
so O
his O
appearance O
on O
stage O
has O
become O
one O
of O
the O
most O
intense O
moments O
. O

After O
his O
participation O
in O
the O
Sanremo O
Festival O
and O
the O
success O
obtained O
with O
his O
third O
CD O
" O
Mi O

" O
, O
Daniele B-PER
Groff I-PER
sang O
" O
Sei O
un O
miracolo O
" O
( O
You O
are O
a O
miracle O
) O
submerged O
by O
the O
applause O
that O
covered O
his O
words O
of O
thanks O
. O

Then O
he O
sang O
" O
Come O
sempre O
" O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
performance O
Daniele B-PER
Groff I-PER
received O
a O

Behind O
the O
scenes O
there O
was O
a O
bustle O
of O

of O

" O
You O

a O
really O
beautiful O

with O
a O
very O
warm O
audience O
that O
in O

has O
been O
able O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
songs O
of O
over O
one O
hundred O
and O
thirty O
artists O
for O
an O

that O
was O

Roberto B-PER

" O
, O
who O
has O
evidently O
recovered O
from O
the O
controversy O
related O
to O
his O
participation O
in O
a O
reality O
show O
, O
has O
been O
able O
to O
galvanize O
the O
audience O
in O
various O
moments O
of O
the O
show O
, O
including O
lighters O
and O
invitations O
to O
make O
the O
world O
hear O
the O
scream O
of O
a O
city O
, O
a O
square O
seen O
in O
every O
corner O
of O

The O
prima O
donna O
Patty B-PER
Pravo I-PER
instead O
did O
not O
want O
to O
renounce O
to O
her O
polemic O
vein O
, O
the O
one O
that O
in O
the O
end O
made O
her O
loved O
by O
many O
, O
underlining O
between O
her O
two O
songs O
" O

and O
" O
Siamo O
sicuri O
che O
" O
as O
in O
that O
moment O
she O
was O
performing O
in O
playback O
. O

Better O
then O
to O
remember O
Mario B-PER
Lavezzi I-PER
one O
of O
the O
protagonists O
of O
the O
beat O
era O
who O
before O
the O
duet O
with O
Veronica B-PER
Piris I-PER
lit O
a O
small O
candle O
on O
the O
stage O
inviting O
to O
remember O
the O
children O
who O
died O
in O
Ossetia B-LOC
. O

The O
most O
beautiful O
musical O
moments O
in O
addition O
to O
Groff B-PER
arrived O
on O
the O
notes O
of O
Michele B-PER
Zarrillo I-PER
and O
the O
night O
went O
off O
on O
the O
notes O
of O
Mango B-PER

by O
his O
velvety O

" O
This O
edition O
will O
be O
remembered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
records O
- O
Raffaelli B-PER
explained O
radiantly O
- O
since O
we O
managed O
to O
bring O
more O
than O
ten O
thousand O
people O
to O

, O
a O
sign O
of O
how O
this O
event O
has O
entered O
the O
hearts O
of O
the O
Trentino O
people O
. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
Raffaelli B-PER
has O
anticipated O
another O
event O
promoted O
by O

The O
doctors O
have O
decided O
for O
a O
cure O
only O
after O
it O
will O
be O
decided O
whether O
to O
intervene O

TURIN B-LOC
- O
Trezeguet B-PER
remains O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
ford O

For O
the O
moment O
he O
will O
not O
operate O
, O
the O
dislocated O
shoulder O
will O
be O
treated O
with O
anti O

inflammatory O
drugs O
and O
physiotherapy O
sessions O
, O
but O
the O
final O
decision O
is O
only O
" O
postponed O
" O
. O

It O
will O
be O
up O
to O
the O
player O
to O
determine O
if O
he O
will O
be O
able O
to O
play O
in O
his O
current O
physical O
condition O
, O
or O
if O
he O
can O
not O
do O
without O
surgery O
. O

" O
No O
decision O
has O
been O
taken O
yet O
" O
, O
confirmed O
yesterday O
the O
head O
of O
the O
team O
. O
confirmed O
yesterday O
the O
head O
of O
the O
medical O
staff O
of O
Juventus B-ORG
, O
Riccardo B-PER
Agricola I-PER
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
consultation O
to O
which O
the O
striker O
underwent O
. O

" O
The O
magnetic O
resonance O
- O
added O
the O
doctor O
- O
showed O
the O
recent O
dislocation O
suffered O
by O
the O
player O
and O
highlighted O
a O
joint O
effusion O
. O

The O
transalpine O
forward O
was O
very O
quiet O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
visit O
: O

" O
Well O
, O
well O
" O
, O
he O
answered O
to O
those O
who O
asked O
him O
about O
his O
health O
. O

The O
therapy O
agreed O
with O
Doctor O
Faletti B-PER
and O
Professor O
Quaglia B-PER
, O
of O
the O
Fornaca B-ORG
clinic O
, O
foresees O
" O
physiotherapy O
sessions O
and O
- O
underlined O
Agricola B-PER
- O
anti O
- O
inflammatory O
treatments O
" O
. O

Only O
in O
a O
few O
days O
, O
therefore O
, O
it O
will O
be O
known O
if O
Juventus B-ORG
will O
have O
to O
do O
without O
the O
French O
champion O
for O
a O
long O
period O
of O
the O
season O
. O

An O
uncertainty O
that O
is O
also O
reflected O
on O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
other O
luxury O
injured O
Juventus O
player O
, O
Alessandro B-PER
Del I-PER
Piero I-PER
. O

With O
the O
market O
closed O
until O
January O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
prolonged O
stop O
of O
Trezeguet B-PER
would O
impose O
an O
accelerated O
recovery O
of O
the O
Juventus O
number O
ten O
. O

The O
only O
Ibrahimovic B-PER
, O
as O
much O
as O
he O
is O
proving O
to O
be O
a O
wise O
purchase O
, O
can O
not O
be O
enough O
for O
a O
team O
as O
committed O
on O
several O
fronts O
as O
Juventus B-ORG
. O

And O
Zalayeta B-PER
, O
despite O
having O
already O
scored O
decisive O
goals O
, O
remains O
an O
' O
unknown O
factor O
in O
terms O
of O
continuity O
. O

Fortunately O
for O
Juve B-ORG
, O
the O
uncertainties O
of O
the O
attack O
are O
, O
however O
, O
compensated O
by O
the O
rediscovered O
security O
of O
the O
defense O
. O

A O
department O
regenerated O
by O
Capello B-PER
's O
care O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
Cannavaro B-PER
and O
the O
recovery O
of O
Thuram B-PER
. O

" O
Last O
year O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
an O
easy O
season O
because O
I O
was O
n't O
well O
- O
said O
the O
French O
defender O
- O
I O
injured O
my O
ankle O
in O
the O
first O
match O
against O
Empoli B-ORG
and O
I O
recovered O
only O
for O
the O
European O
Championship O
. O

Thuram B-PER
has O
a O
clear O
idea O
about O
Juventus B-ORG
' O
defense O
- O
bunker O
: O

" O
When O
we O
take O
few O
goals O
- O
he O
underlined O
- O
we O
owe O
it O
to O
the O
whole O
team O
that O
is O
working O
well O
. O

Cannavaro B-PER
, O
Buffon B-PER
and O
I O
are O
close O
, O
and O
playing O
alongside O
Fabio B-PER
makes O
things O
easier O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
serious O
to O
give O
us O
all O
the O
credit O
. O

In O
any O
case O
- O
added O
Thuram B-PER
- O
before O
giving O
a O
definitive O
judgement O
we O
must O
wait O
for O
the O
whole O
championship O
. O

We O
are O
doing O
well O
, O
but O
we O
can O
start O
well O
and O
finish O
badly O
, O
or O
vice O
versa O
. O

And O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
big O
teams O
in O
difficulty O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
they O
will O
be O
in O
front O
, O
close O
to O
us O
. O

Thuram B-PER
tries O
to O
mask O
the O
concern O
for O
the O
injuries O
of O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
and O
Trezeguet B-PER
: O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
exactly O
what O
they O
have O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
but O
I O
hope O
they O
wo O
n't O
be O
out O
for O
long O
. O

Without O
spikes O
, O
Juventus B-PER
could O
struggle O
to O
score O
and O
already O
in O
the O
last O
few O
games O
has O
reduced O
the O
number O
of O
goals O
: O

" O
It O
's O
the O
fault O
of O
the O
adversaries O
who O
close O
themselves O
in O
their O
half O
of O
the O
field O
- O
is O
Thuram B-PER
's O
thesis O
- O
and O
give O
up O
to O
attack O
. O

In O
this O
situation O
, O
it O
's O
normal O
to O
struggle O
in O
attack O
and O
then O
the O
goals O
arrive O
on O
set O
pieces O
. O

Province B-LOC

A O
letter O
asks O
for O
sacrifices O

Objective O
: O

cuts O
for O
120 O
million O
euros O

Dellai B-PER
postpones O
to O
November O
the O
budget O
2005 O
and O
it O
will O
go O
in O
provisional O
exercise O

By O
LUISA B-PER
PATRUNO I-PER

For O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
it O
is O
a O
delicate O
passage O
: O

He O
must O
cut O
the O
beauty O
of O
3 O
% O
of O
the O
budget O
, O
which O
means O
, O
compared O
to O
3,943 O
million O
euros O
of O
the O
' O
assessment O
2004 O
, O
give O
up O
about O
120 O
million O
euros O
. O

And O
it O
must O
decide O
what O
to O
focus O
on O
and O
what O
to O
sacrifice O
. O

Yesterday O
he O
announced O
to O
the O
group O
leaders O
of O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
that O
he O
will O
not O
present O
the O
2005 O
budget O
in O
time O
to O
avoid O
the O
temporary O
exercise O
. O

" O
We O
will O
approve O
it O
at O
the O
end O
of O
November O
instead O
of O
by O
October O
- O
explained O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
- O
so O
that O
the O
examination O
in O
committee O
can O
begin O
in O
mid O
- O
January O
and O
arrive O
in O
court O
in O
February O
. O

We O
are O
waiting O
for O
the O
fiscal O
manoeuvre O
of O
the O
Government O
that O
will O
be O
presented O
with O
the O
financial O
bill O
, O
without O
which O
we O
are O
not O
able O
to O
know O
exactly O
which O
and O
how O
many O
resources O
we O
can O
count O
on O
" O
. O

Officially O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
Province B-LOC
is O
" O
forced O
" O
to O
slide O
into O
a O
provisional O
financial O
year O
for O
external O
reasons O
and O
in O
order O
not O
to O
risk O
drawing O
up O
an O
accounting O
document O
that O
will O
then O
be O
perhaps O
reworked O
. O

But O
the O
postponement O
remains O
a O
sign O
of O
difficulty O
, O
which O
the O
rating O
agencies O
, O
which O
until O
today O
have O
rewarded O
our O
Province B-LOC
, O
might O
not O
ignore O
in O
their O
judgement O
of O
next O
year O
. O

Provisional O
year O
means O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
that O
for O
the O
first O
months O
of O
the O
year O
we O
will O
have O
to O
limit O
ourselves O
to O
the O
ordinary O
administration O
. O

And O
more O
than O
one O
councillor O
had O
advised O
against O
this O
choice O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
not O
only O
the O
times O
of O
Minister O
Siniscalco B-PER
and O
Berlusconi B-PER
are O
involved O
in O
Dellai B-PER
's O
postponement O
. O

In O
recent O
weeks O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
president O
has O
been O
confronted O
with O
his O
junta B-ORG
, O
has O
shown O
the O
accounts O
and O
forecasts O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
responsible O
attitude O
. O

Then O
he O
sent O
a O
letter O
- O
it O
is O
from O
these O
days O
- O
to O
each O
councillor O
in O
which O
he O
basically O
asks O
each O
one O
to O
indicate O
the O
priorities O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
what O
and O
how O
much O
- O
in O
percentage O
- O
he O
is O
willing O
to O
cut O
from O
his O
2004 O
budget O
, O
manifesting O
the O
need O
to O
arrive O
at O
an O
overall O
reduction O
of O
even O
3 O
% O
. O

The O
President O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
policy O
of O
this O
center O
- O
left O
government O
, O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
cut O
the O
social O
state O
, O
in O
particular O
health O
care O
, O
nor O
the O
socio O
- O
welfare O
sector O
, O
even O
though O
many O
of O
the O
proposals O
announced O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
be O
reduced O
, O
nor O
research O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
Dellai B-PER
wants O
to O
respect O
the O
" O
stability O
pact O
" O
with O
the O
State O
and O
not O
be O
downgraded O
by O
the O
rating O
agencies O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
orientation O
that O
is O
emerging O
is O
that O
the O
sectors O
that O
will O
have O
to O
sacrifice O
the O
most O
will O
be O
: O

culture O
, O
public O
works O
and O
economic O
sectors O
. O

In O
short O
, O
there O
will O
be O
fewer O
resources O
for O
museums O
, O
bands O
and O
associations O
, O
to O
build O
roads O
, O
sports O
arenas O
and O
fire O
stations O
in O
every O
corner O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
but O
also O
fewer O
contributions O
and O
initiatives O
to O
support O
economic O
activities O
. O

It O
will O
try O
to O
" O
readjust O
" O
the O
' O
commitment O
represented O
by O
the O
territorial O
pacts O
, O
which O
are O
sucking O
many O
resources O
. O

This O
is O
just O
to O
mention O
some O
of O
the O
items O
most O
" O
at O
risk O
" O
. O

For O
Dellai B-PER
, O
this O

In O

of O

Cgil B-ORG
: O

" O
The O

in O

anticipated O
, O
but O
the O
reduction O

So O

there O
have O
been O
no O
meetings O

Purin B-PER
immediately O
clarifies O
some O
points O
: O

" O
We O
are O
going O
through O
a O
delicate O
phase O
, O
which O
entails O
a O
series O
of O

Controversy O
shared O
in O
full O
by O
Ermanno B-PER
Monari I-PER
, O
secretary O
general O
of O
Uil B-ORG
: O

" O
We O
have O
been O
sending O
a O
letter O
to O
President O
Dellai B-PER
for O
a O
long O
time O
asking O
for O
additional O
resources O
on O
public O
employment O

. O

We O
have O
not O
had O
any O
answer O
. O

First O
motive O
of O
polemic O
. O

But O
that O
's O
not O
all O
: O

" O
Many O
other O

have O
been O
adopting O
the O

for O
some O
time O
, O
while O
the O
Province B-LOC
merely O
presents O
the O
budget O
and O
that O
's O
it O
. O

And O
to O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
important O
to O
know O
what O
the O
income O
and O
investment O
policy O
of O
the O
council B-ORG
is O
. O

According O
to O
Monari B-PER
, O
the O
historical O
moment O
is O
so O
worrying O
as O
to O
" O
motivate O
the O
involvement O
not O
only O
of O
the O

but O
also O
of O
the O

society O
" O
in O
the O

policies O
of O

According O
to O
the O
Uil B-ORG
secretary O
, O
even O
a O
declining O
budget O
must O
" O
study O
" O
what O
are O
the O
most O
effective O
weapons O
to O
counteract O

Not O

and O
the O
whole O
fabric O
of O

that O
accompanies O
the O
event O
of O

Because O
breastfeeding O
is O
a O
desire O
of O
almost O
all O
Trentino O
mothers O
. O

" O
It O
is O
very O
rare O
- O
underlined O
neonatologist O
Dino B-PER
Pedrotti I-PER
- O
that O
a O
mother O
asks O
not O
to O
breastfeed O
. O

The O
cultural O
and O

has O
paid O
off O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
up O
to O
all O

to O
make O
this O
desire O
come O
true O
. O

And O
it O
is O
precisely O

The O
data O
of O

are O
encouraging O
because O
they O
have O
seen O
a O
significant O
increase O
( O
more O
than O
double O
) O
of O

who O
breastfeed O
exclusively O
, O
according O
to O
a O

of O
the O

Currently O
, O
42 O
% O
of O

the O
number O
should O

because O
these O
are O
valuable O

As O
valuable O
opportunities O
would O
be O
the O

that O

TRENTO B-LOC
- O
It O
is O
highly O
probable O
that O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
a O
capital O
increase O
will O
be O
put O
aside O
, O
and O
the O
operating O
program O
for O
2005 O
will O
be O
postponed O
to O
the O
next O
board O
of O
directors O
, O
due O
to O
the O
uncertainty O
regarding O
available O
resources O
. O

The O
board O
of O

of O

will O
be O
full O
of O
arguments O

with O
few O

Yesterday O
, O
apparently O
, O
in O
an O
informal O
meeting O
of O
the O
board B-ORG
of I-ORG
directors I-ORG
, O
it O
was O
made O
clear O
that O
it O
is O
better O
not O
to O
do O
anything O
about O
the O
capital O
increase O
. O

For O
the O
president O
Claudio B-PER
Miorelli I-PER
, O
" O
the O
point O
on O
the O
agenda O
will O
be O
discussed O
, O
as O
I O
said O
it O
was O
an O
option O
that O
could O
be O
included O
in O
the O
next O
extraordinary O
meeting O
. O

There O
is O
no O
urgency O
, O
so O
probably O
nothing O
will O
be O
done O
about O
it O
. O

While O
the O
question O
of O
resources O
for O
2005 O
comes O
to O

again O
, O
and O
the O
tourism O

, O
whose O
proposal O
awaits O
only O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
's O
approval O
, O
is O
still O
a O

hypothesis O
, O
today O
the O
board B-ORG
of I-ORG
directors I-ORG
will O
discuss O
promotion O
for O

. O

" O
But O
probably O
- O
says O
Miorelli B-PER
- O
its O
approval O
will O
be O
postponed O
to O
the O
next O

It O
is O
necessary O

for O
the O

the O
avian O

caused O
three O
secondary O

but O
there O
is O
still O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O

Since O
January O
this O

human O
cases O
of O
avian O
influenza O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
two O
countries O
, O
Vietnam B-LOC

Thailand B-LOC

According O
to O
experts O
, O
the O
avian O
influenza O
virus O
becomes O
dangerous O
if O
it O
is O
superimposed O
on O
the O
human O
influenza O
virus O
, O
because O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
human O
virus O
it O
can O
undergo O
changes O

The O

reduces O
the O

A O

After O
the O
screening O
of O
the O
film O
" O
The O
Iceman O
" O
by O
Brando B-PER
Quilici I-PER
, O
which O
tells O
the O
story O
of O
the O
research O
that O
took O
place O
around O
the O
mummy O
found O
in O
the O
South O
Tyrolean O

the O
new O

the O
debate O

students O
of O
the O
Don B-ORG

the O
archaeologist O
Umberto B-PER
Tecchiati I-PER
, O
of O
the O
Archaeological O
Heritage B-ORG
Office I-ORG
of O
Bolzano B-LOC
. O

According O
to O
medical O
analysis O
, O
the O
Iceman O
was O
surely O
killed O
by O
an O
arrow O
that O
struck O
him O
in O
the O
back O
. O

Who O
was O
this O
man O
who O
carried O
a O
copper O
axe O
and O
why O
was O
he O
killed O
, O
were O
the O
two O
questions O
at O
the O
center O
of O
the O
debate O
. O

Surely O
he O
was O
a O
man O
of O
rank O
: O

He O
carried O
an O
object O
reserved O
for O
the O
highest O
class O
, O
a O
copper O
axe O
. O

In O
his O
hands O
he O
held O
a O
dagger O
, O
and O
his O
body O
shows O
clear O
signs O
of O
a O
struggle O
. O

The O
most O
recent O
hypotheses O
speak O
of O
a O
shepherd O
, O
murdered O
for O
his O
flocks O
. O

" O
But O
if O
so O
- O
Tecchiati B-PER
explained O
- O
why O
did O
n't O
they O
steal O
the O
axe O
, O
an O
object O
of O
enormous O
value O
at O
the O
time O
? O

" O

Another O
hypothesis O
speaks O
of O
a O
shaman O
, O
a O
man O
of O
religion O
who O
would O
have O
immolated O
himself O
for O
his O
people O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
explained O
, O
even O
in O
this O
case O
, O
the O
armament O
of O
which O
he O
was O
equipped O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
death O
and O
the O
blow O
to O
the O
shoulders O
. O

In O
the O
archaeologically O
documented O
cases O
of O
human O
sacrifice O
, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
ritual O
killing O
, O
with O
an O
arrow O
shot O
in O
the O
back O
from O
a O
considerable O
distance O
at O
a O
speed O
of O
about O
140 O
km O
. O

According O
to O
Tecchiati B-PER
, O
it O
was O
certainly O
a O
man O
of O
high O
rank O
, O
a O
survivor O
, O
since O
in O
an O
era O
in O
which O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
reach O
thirty O
years O
, O
Oetzi B-PER
died O
murdered O
at O
an O
age O
of O
over O
40 O
. O

The O
scarce O
wear O
of O
the O
bones O
of O
the O
articulations O
denotes O
a O
life O
deprived O
of O
physical O
stress O
, O
therefore O
it O
excludes O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
the O
shepherd O
. O

The O
tattoos O
on O
the O
body O
are O
not O
evidence O
of O
belonging O
to O
a O
specific O
caste O
as O
that O
of O
shamans O
, O
because O
the O
most O
plausible O
explanation O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
the O
magical O
thaumaturgic O
, O
reserved O
for O
a O
particular O
man O
, O
but O
not O
necessarily O
a O
man O
of O
religion O
. O

The O
mystery O
of O
√ñtzi B-PER
continues O
to O
fascinate O
researchers O

is O
destined O
to O
keep O

the O

the O

decisive O
. O

" O
Competitive O
tennis O
at O
a O
high O
level O
is O
made O
like O
this O
- O
Andrea B-PER
told O
us O
- O
and O
the O
imperative O
is O
to O
never O
give O
up O
, O
you O
have O
to O
make O
points O
and O
confirm O
them O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
have O
stopped O
for O
the O
A1 B-ORG
I O
will O
go O
down O
to O
290 O
. O

But O
the O
season O
that O
has O
just O
ended O
has O
however O
regenerated O
her O
, O
now O
she O
is O
back O
to O
do O
the O
big O

especially O
on O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
complain O
but O
it O
is O
also O
right O
to O
never O
be O
happy O
. O

The O
dream O
is O
always O
to O
reach O
the O
top O
100 O
. O

Of O
course O
when O
you O
always O
have O
to O
play O
the O
qualifiers O
it O
is O
not O
so O
easy O
. O

This O
year O
he O
won O
the O
15 O

a O
prestigious O

lost O
in O
the O
third O
, O
another O
final O
on O
the O

in O
the O
10 O
thousand O

in O
the O

a O

" O
I O
was O
sorry O
to O
lose O
that O
final O
with O
Uros B-PER
Vico I-PER
in O
Recanati B-LOC
, O
perhaps O
I O
deserved O
more O
( O
some O
dubious O

create O
regret O
... O
) O
, O
then O
the O
match O
with O
Galimberti B-PER
in O

Benedetto I-LOC

another O
missed O
opportunity O
. O

But O
- O
admits O
Stoppini B-PER
sincerely O
- O
in O
other O
matches O
I O
had O
more O
luck O
. O

Valerio B-PER
told O
us O

that O
he O
gets O
into O
a O
crisis O
of O

when O
he O
loses O

" O
Once O
maybe O

otherwise O
now O

On O

the O

In O

I O
earned O
the O
A1 B-ORG

where O
I O
played O
last O
year O
with O
Lombardo B-ORG
Milano I-ORG
. O

Now O
I O
think O
about O
Ata B-ORG
Trentino I-ORG
and O
our O
salvation O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
the O
Atp B-ORG

of O
the O
four O
singles O
( O
6 O
points O

so O
if O
Vassallo B-PER
is O
missing O
, O
I O
will O
be O
No O
. O
1 O
and O
I O
will O
have O
to O
sweat O

I O
think O
we O
play O
it O

the O

level O
with O
Castellazzo B-ORG

TRENTO B-LOC
- O
The O

not O
to O

Because O
if O

indeed O
, O
if O

of O

in O
any O

difficult O
to O

Or O
, O
to O
put O
it O

, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
understand O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
exit O
of O
the O
powerful O
councillor O
from O
Marches O
. O

Who O
, O
evidently O
considering O
the O
opening O
of O
a O
branch O
of O
an O
institute O
, O
the O
Volksbank B-ORG
- O
an O
excellent O
bank O
but O
not O
exactly O
a O
credit O
giant O
able O
to O
colonize O
lands O
and O
markets O
- O
as O
an O
intolerable O
affront O
and O
a O
mortal O
danger O
, O
has O
forgotten O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
. O

The O
first O
is O
that O
, O
among O
the O
many O
powers O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
and O
its O
councillors O
, O
there O
is O
no O
power O
to O
prevent O
a O
company O
from O
doing O
its O
job O
, O
and O
from O
doing O
it O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
if O
it O
believes O
it O
can O
do O
so O
profitably O
. O

Whether O
it O
has O
its O
headquarters O
in O
Bolzano B-LOC
or O
Shanghai B-LOC
makes O
no O
difference O
. O

The O
interference O
of O
a O
politician O
and O
an O
administrator O
in O
market O
matters O
is O
, O
yes O
, O
intolerable O
. O

Unless O
the O
condemnation O
of O
the O
conflict O
of O
interests O
is O
valid O
only O
for O
some O
and O
not O
for O
others O
. O

The O
second O
thing O
Grisenti B-PER
has O
forgotten O
is O
that O
today O
it O
is O
a O
little O
late O
to O
take O
the O
field O
. O

" O
We O
are O
not O
a O
land O
of O
conquest O
, O
" O
he O
thundered O
. O

Frankly O
, O
no O
one O
had O
noticed O
. O

And O
nobody O
, O
probably O
, O
will O
believe O
it O
, O
after O
that O
, O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
the O
biggest O
banks O
in O
Trentino O
have O
fallen O
under O
the O
control O
of O
big O
national O
groups O
. O

The O
war O
against O
the O
conquest O
had O
to O
be O
waged O
, O
possibly O
, O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
, O
however O
, O
the O
rich O
capital O
gains O
received O
by O
those O
who O
sold O
the O
controlling O
shares O
of O
our O
banks O
made O
the O
babau O
of O
colonization O
less O
scary O
. O

It O
is O
useless O
, O
now O
, O
to O
blame O
those O
who O
have O
been O
able O
to O
resist O
those O
temptations O
. O

Starting O
with O
Sparkasse B-ORG
, O
which O
will O
soon O
open O
a O
bridgehead O
in O
Trento B-LOC
and O
which O
is O
already O
worrying O
, O
more O
than O
the O
political O
palaces O
, O
the O
directors O
of O
the O
competing O
institutions O
. O

What O
will O
Grisenti B-PER
do O
when O
Sparkasse B-ORG
opens O
its O
headquarters O
in O
Trento O
? O

The O
third O
thing O
that O
the O
councillor O
has O
forgotten O
is O
that O
the O
final O
judges O
of O
the O
credit O
challenge O
will O
be O
the O
consumers O
, O
who O
will O
be O
able O
to O
decide O
to O
transfer O
their O
account O
from O
a O
rural O
bank O
to O
a O
popular O
one O
in O
Alto O
Adige O
and O
vice O
versa O
, O
perhaps O
obtaining O
better O
conditions O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
new O
mechanism O

it O
's O

I O
do O

the O

of O

will O
go O
on O

a O
long O
time O
because O

I O
myself O
- O
reveals O
Amistadi B-PER

do O
not O
find O
it O
correct O
because O
it O
guarantees O
those O
who O
have O
already O
had O
, O
while O
it O
penalizes O
us O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
however O
I O
will O
vote O
for O
it O
only O
for O
party O
discipline O
. O

The O
councillor O
for O
local O
authorities O
believes O
that O
there O
is O
a O
real O
risk O
that O
the O
law O
on O

will O
not O
be O
approved O
in O
time O
for O

is O
concerned O
that O

" O

Amistadi B-PER

Amistadi B-PER

himself O

the O
fact O
that O
the O
goal O

where O

was O
like O

of O
a O
few O
years O
. O

High O
, O
tall O
and O
serious O
, O
with O
her O
air O
at O
first O
sight O
very O
severe O

Difficult O
even O
to O
talk O

there O
is O
something O
that O
becomes O
a O

with O
ups O

downs O
like O
all O
friendships O
long O

Friendship O
means O
spending O
afternoons O

evenings O
and O
nights O
together O
reading O
and O
studying O
and O
discussing O
, O
but O
she O
always O
talks O
more O
because O
she O
knows O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
and O
is O
really O
able O
to O
fascinate O
and O
involve O
. O

Friendship O
means O
to O
study O
, O
but O
also O
to O
have O
a O
few O
laughs O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
a O

, O
Maria B-PER
, O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
talk O
about O
difficult O
, O
serious O
and O
demanding O
things O
with O
the O
lightness O
of O
curiosity O
, O
the O
exactness O
of O
analysis O
and O
criticism O
, O
the O
precision O
of O
judgment O
. O

But O
talking O
about O
it O
now O
costs O
pain O
and O
effort O
. O

So O
, O
even O
if O
in O
the O
background O
there O
is O
the O
gallery O
of O
literary O
authors O
and O
a O
long O
theory O
of O
critics O
and O
her O
passion O
and O
enthusiasm O
, O
Maria B-PER
's O
last O
image O
dominates O
today O
, O
that O
of O
long O
suffering O
, O
of O
the O
ever O
greater O
and O
harder O
effort O
to O
live O
. O

Maria B-PER
always O
continues O
to O
struggle O
and O
devour O
books O
, O
obsessively O
, O
almost O
as O
if O
to O
exorcise O
the O
problem O
of O
life O
going O
away O
, O
and O
the O
problem O
of O
death O
that O
this O
time O
is O
not O
written O
on O
a O
literary O
text O
but O
that O
plants O
itself O
inside O
your O
body O
and O
devours O
you O
. O

And O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
it O
. O

You O
have O
to O
be O
a O
saint O
like O
Francis B-PER
to O
say O
" O
Laudato O
si O
' O
, O
my O
Lord B-PER
, O
for O
our O
death O
" O
. O

It O
is O
inevitable O
that O
normal O
people O
feel O
bewilderment O
when O
they O
come O
close O
to O
" O
the O
last O
line O
of O
things O
" O
, O
beyond O
which O
" O
we O
are O
dust O
and O
shadow O
" O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
understand O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
, O
alongside O
the O
bewilderment O
of O
those O
who O
are O
left O
behind O
, O
there O
are O
also O
reasons O
for O
consolation O
. O

They O
may O
not O
be O
much O
compared O
to O
the O
loss O
, O
but O
at O
least O
they O
are O
there O
. O

In O
the O
harshness O
of O
detachment O
, O
one O
can O
finally O
see O
her O
again O
, O
serene O
and O
great O
and O
no O
longer O
sullen O
: O

She O
is O
no O
longer O
bent O
by O
suffering O
and O
illness O
. O

And O
then O
she O
remained O
at O
home O
, O
among O
her O
things O
and O
her O
books O
and O
the O
environment O
of O
her O
life O
. O

With O
the O
Duomo O
outside O
the O
window O
and O
the O
hours O
that O
beat O
, O
difficult O
especially O
in O
the O
infinite O
and O
exhausting O
length O
of O
the O
night O
. O

It O
will O
have O
been O
difficult O
and O
it O
will O
be O
little O
, O
but O
one O
can O
think O
and O
hope O
that O
Maria B-PER
is O
happy O
to O
have O
been O
accompanied O
so O
far O
beyond O
the O
last O
line O
of O
things O
. O

And O
we O
can O
only O
add O
, O
paraphrasing O
an O
ancient O
poet O
, O
that O
" O
if O
some O
sweetness O
can O
come O
to O
the O
mute O
graves O
from O
our O
pain O
, O
from O
that O
sense O
of O
loss O
in O
which O
we O
keep O
alive O
the O
affections O
that O
have O
dissolved O
in O
fear O
, O
certainly O
death O
will O
not O
give O
her O
a O
greater O
and O
stronger O
pain O
than O
the O
joy O
that O
will O
come O
from O
our O
love O
. O

Dellai B-PER

already O
announced O
that O
he O
will O
meet O
, O
together O
with O
the O
competent O

, O
a O
trade O

delegation O
. O

In O
the O
afternoon O
, O
the O
ball O
will O
then O
pass O
to O
the O
technicians O
for O
a O
more O
operational O
discussion O
focused O
on O
the O
fate O
of O
about O
90 O
employees O
of O
the O
French O
multinational O
tire O
company O
, O
which O
has O
turned O
to O
an O
international O
agency O
, O
the O
Dml B-ORG
Conseil I-ORG
, O
to O
identify O
an O
industrial O
entity O
interested O
in O
taking O
over O
the O
company O
, O
taking O
on O
the O
financial O
burden O
of O
the O
operation O
and O
promoting O
a O
so O
- O
called O
" O
social O
plan O
" O
to O
mitigate O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
closure O
. O

But O
beyond O
the O
specific O
case O
, O
the O
risk O
of O
delocalization O
continues O
to O
keep O
the O
workers O
' O
organizations O
on O
edge O
. O

Even O
if O
with O
different O
positions O
. O

" O
The O
tendency O
to O
delocalize O
, O
especially O
for O
companies O
in O
the O
textile O
sector O
- O
says O
the O
provincial O
secretary O
of O
Uil B-ORG
, O
Ermanno B-PER
Monari I-PER
- O
is O
a O
more O
than O
understandable O
need O
, O
and O
often O
constitutes O
the O
only O
way O
to O
remain O
competitive O
. O

The O
delocalization O
, O
therefore O
, O
does O
not O
go O
demonized O
but O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
governed O
. O

In O
order O
to O
succeed O
, O
Monari B-PER
explains O
, O
" O
However O
, O
a O
great O
effort O
is O
needed O
from O
everyone O
. O

We O
must O
ensure O
that O
the O
entrepreneur O
is O
put O
in O
a O
position O
to O
be O
able O
to O
move O
machinery O
and O
production O
, O
without O
this O
leading O
to O
a O
flight O
abroad O
of O
the O
company O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

" O
According O
to O
Monari B-PER
, O
the O
company O
's O
" O
head O
" O
and O
strategy O
must O
remain O
in O
the O
territory O
, O
as O
must O
its O
wealth O
, O
" O
which O
must O
be O
distributed O
and O

is O
this O
: O

in O

. O

This O
is O
the O
clarification O
of O
the O
Appa B-ORG
after O
the O
different O
communication O
made O
yesterday O
by O
voice O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meeting O
between O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
technicians O
and O
municipalities O
. O

Only O
the O
Euro O
0 O
, O
therefore O
, O
will O
be O
forced O
to O
remain O
stationary O
. O

And O
maybe O
not O
even O
those O
. O

Or O
at O
least O
, O
not O
all O
of O
them O
. O

In O
the O
program O
agreement O
that O
the O
Province B-LOC
presented O
yesterday O
, O
as O
a O
basis O
for O
discussion O
while O
waiting O
to O
put O
together O
the O
comments O
that O
will O
arrive O
next O
week O
from O
the O
municipalities O
, O
it O
is O
in O
fact O
assumed O
the O
possibility O
of O
granting O
a O
derogation O
to O
the O
circulation O
( O
from O
November O
1 O
, O
2005 O
) O
to O
the O
owners O
of O
vehicles O
that O
would O
commit O
themselves O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
to O
replace O
their O
" O
old O
cars O
" O
with O
less O
polluting O
means O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
if O
the O
owner O
of O
a O
non O
- O
catalyzed O
gasoline O
car O
or O
of O
a O
Euro O
0 O
diesel O
car O
signed O
a O
sort O
of O
contract O
with O
the O
Province B-LOC
in O
which O
they O
formalized O
their O
intention O
to O
replace O
their O
polluting O
vehicle O
within O
the O
expiry O
of O
the O
three O
- O
year O
plan O
, O
they O
would O
receive O
a O
sort O
of O
safe O
- O
conduct O
to O
be O
able O
to O
travel O
at O
any O
time O
of O
the O
year O
( O
and O
especially O
with O
any O
weather O
conditions O
) O
on O
roads O
that O
would O
otherwise O
be O
off O
limits O
to O
them O
. O

The O
proposal O
, O
certainly O
already O
attractive O
enough O
for O
many O
, O
could O
be O
even O
unmissable O
if O
it O
passed O
the O
line O
of O
some O
municipalities O
that O
- O
according O
to O
rumors O
- O
have O
already O
formulated O
the O
' O
assessor O
's O
intention O
to O
request O
that O
the O
derogation O
is O
activated O
as O
early O
as O
this O
' O
winter O
. O

For O
his O
part O
, O
Councillor O
Gilmozzi B-PER
is O
cautious O
. O

The O
matter O
is O
delicate O
and O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
risk O
. O

" O
First O
of O
all O
- O
he O
interjects O
- O
it O
must O
be O
specified O
that O
this O
is O
a O
proposal O
; O

It O
will O
have O
to O
be O
discussed O
with O
all O
the O
municipalities O
. O

On O
the O
issue O
of O
exemptions O
will O
then O
be O
the O
individual O
administrations O
to O
decide O
who O
to O
release O
the O
permit O
to O
circulate O
despite O
the O
blocks O
, O
certainly O
not O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

The O
risk O
, O
easily O
guessed O
, O
is O
that O
if O
the O
municipalities O
were O
to O
be O
rather O
lenient O
in O
granting O
exemptions O
, O
very O
few O
polluting O
vehicles O
would O
remain O
stationary O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
councillor O
Gilmozzi B-PER
communicates O
that O
the O
blocks O
of O
diesel O
and O
gasoline O
of O
old O
generation O
( O
two O
days O
in O
a O
week O
) O
should O
start O
from O
November O
15th O
. O

Before O
that O
date O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
yesterday O
( O
and O
for O
the O
seventh O
consecutive O
day O
) O
the O
limits O
were O
exceeded O
, O
no O
traffic O
limitation O
measures O
will O
be O
instituted O
. O

" O
It O
would O
only O
create O
confusion O
, O
" O
says O
Gilmozzi B-PER
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
' O
program O
agreement O
between O
municipalities O
and O
the O
Province B-LOC
sets O
the O
' O
commitment O
of O
' O
central O
government O
to O
define O
within O
180 O
days O
the O
operational O
lines O

Three O

that O
instead O
, O
according O
to O
the O

Office I-ORG
- O
yesterday O
the O
former O
employer O
of O
Simonetta B-PER
, O
Salvatore B-PER
Volponi I-PER
, O
was O
heard O
- O
could O
be O
connected O
by O
a O
red O
thread O
. O

A O
thread O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
identity O
of O
Simonetta B-PER

murderer O
, O
a O
man O

well O

with O
whom O
she O
may O
even O
have O
had O
a O
sentimental O
" O
liason O
" O
. O

But O
there O
is O
more O
: O

The O
public O
prosecutor O
could O
decide O
to O
interrogate O
in O
the O
coming O
weeks O
old O
or O
new O
protagonists O
of O
the O
mystery O
and O
then O
point O
again O
the O
attention O
on O
the O
building O
of O

. O

The O
cue O
that O
opens O
a O
new O
chapter O
in O
the O
story O
comes O
from O
a O
book O
not O
yet O
published O
, O
written O
by O
the O
Cesaroni B-PER

former O
employer O
, O
Salvatore B-PER
Volponi I-PER

Aged O
, O
his O
tone O
resigned O
, O
Volponi B-PER
was O
summoned O
to O
the O
Prosecutor O
's O
Office O
yesterday O
. O

" O
I O
know O
that O
Simonetta B-PER
had O
a O
recent O
relationship O
with O
a O
man O
, O
" O
said O
the O

was O
accompanied O
to O
Piazzale O
Clodio O
by O
his O
lawyer O
, O
Maria B-PER
Antonietta I-PER
Lamazza I-PER
. O

To O
make O
plausible O
the O
version O
of O
Volponi B-PER
- O
who O
in O
the O
book O
" O
I O
, O
Smonetta O
and O
Via O
Poma O
" O
also O
tells O
the O
personal O
story O
of O
a O
man O
destroyed O
by O
the O
affair O
- O
is O
a O
writing O
of O
Simonetta B-PER
Cesaroni I-PER
herself O
that O
has O
been O
revisited O
with O
other O
eyes O
by O
the O
pm O
Cavallone B-PER
. O

Some O
verses O
of O
a O
song O
by O
Lucio B-PER
Dalla I-PER
kept O
in O
the O
bag O
would O
suggest O
a O
particular O
emotional O
situation O
of O
the O
girl O
, O
out O
of O
a O
long O
love O
story O
and O
about O
to O
begin O
another O
. O

" O
And O
for O
what O
should O
I O
regret O
- O
Simonetta B-PER
writes O
on O
a O
sheet O
of O
paper O
found O
in O
the O
bag O
along O
with O
the O
box O
of O
contraceptives O
- O
to O
play O
with O
life O
, O
to O
take O
it O
by O
the O
tail O
? O

One O
day O
it O
will O
have O
to O
end O
, O
I O
have O
already O
thought O
about O
eternity O
. O

Eternal O
is O
also O
a O
minute O
, O
every O
kiss O
I O
received O
from O
the O
people O
I O
loved O
. O

But O
it O
is O
from O
the O
DNA O
analysis O
on O
the O
blood O
trace O
, O
examined O
by O
the O
Ris B-ORG
carabinieri O
and O
whose O
results O
will O
be O
known O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
month O
, O
that O
the O
turning O
point O
could O
come O
. O

If O
it O
will O
be O
shown O
that O
the O
DNA O
is O
compatible O
with O
that O
of O
Simonetta B-PER
or O
compatible O
with O
that O
of O
a O
third O
person O
( O
the O
murderer O
? O
) O
, O
the O
yellow O
of O
Via B-LOC
Poma I-LOC
could O
come O
closer O
to O
a O
solution O
. O

The O
blood O
trace O
has O
been O
found O
in O
the O
rooms O
that O
host O
the O
wash O
- O
houses O
of O
the O
condominium O
in O
via B-LOC
Poma I-LOC
2 I-LOC
. O

It O
could O
indicate O
that O
the O
murderer O
cleaned O
himself O
there O
. O

It O
could O
also O
indicate O
that O
he O
escaped O
, O
taking O
the O
elevator O
from O
the O
third O
floor O
( O
traces O
of O

were O
also O

In O

, O
one O
who O
knew O
the O
building O
well O

Finally O
, O
from O
the O
new O
investigation O
would O
emerge O
disconcerting O
details O
such O
as O
the O
disappearance O
of O
the O
few O
garments O
found O
on O
the O
body O
, O
a O
bra O
and O
a O
bodice O
disappeared O
from O
the O
repertoire O
of O
evidence O
. O

The O
only O
garments O
that O
covered O
the O
body O
of O
Simonetta B-PER
killed O
with O
29 O
stabs O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
those O
wounds O
, O
the O
swollen O
face O
, O
the O
sign O
of O
a O
fist O
given O
by O
the O
murderer O
, O
and O
a O
bite O
on O
the O
breast O
. O

A O
sign O
of O
a O
violent O
approach O
by O
her O
new O
love O
that O
ended O
in O
tragedy O
. O

? O
Probably O
the O
Juventus O
fantasist O
will O
make O
couple O
, O
at O
least O
initially O
, O
with O
Gilardino B-PER
. O

Lippi B-PER
proposes O
Alex B-PER
Del I-PER
Piero I-PER
again O

" O
He O

the O

he O
must O
be O
relieved O
of O

Only O
one O
certainty O
, O
Alessandro B-PER

Without O
revealing O
the O
other O
cards O
, O
at O
his O
Azzurri O
match O
number O
three O
Marcello B-PER
Lippi I-PER
prepares O
to O
invent O
another O
Italy B-PER
, O
the O
third O
. O

Certainly O
not O
for O
fear O
of O
today O
's O
opponent O
, O
Moldova B-ORG
, O
nor O
only O
for O
the O
repeated O
reasons O
of O
a O
psycho O
- O
physical O
nature O
after O
the O
effort O
of O
Saturday O
's O
match O
. O

C O
' O
is O
rather O
- O
he O
explains O
- O
to O
manage O
the O
victory O
against O
Norway B-ORG
and O
work O
for O
the O
future O
. O

To O
come O
out O
of O
the O
first O
combination O
for O
the O
2006 O
World O
Championship O
with O
a O
double O
success O
would O
be O
a O
launching O
pad O
. O

But O
to O
prepare O
with O
care O
the O
next O
flight O
must O
be O
for O
Lippi B-PER
even O
more O
important O
. O

And O
therefore O
, O
out O
a O
talent O
from O
the O
portentous O
exploit O
, O
De B-PER
Rossi I-PER
, O
in O
a O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
in O
search O
of O
redemption O
, O
and O
possible O
news O
in O
the O
module O
. O

" O
I O
expect O
a O
nice O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
- O
says O
Lippi B-PER
- O
Not O
that O
it O
is O
the O
game O
of O
redemption O
, O
he O
was O
not O
even O
in O
Iceland B-LOC
.... O

But O
Alessandro B-PER
arrived O
at O
the O
training O
camp O
ten O
days O
ago O
like O
everyone O
else O
, O
with O
a O
great O
desire O
to O
do O
well O
and O
, O
in O
a O
certain O
sense O
, O
to O
be O
redeemed O
. O

He O
could O
n't O
transform O
it O
into O
the O
field O
because O
of O
an O
injury O
: O

Now O
it O
's O
up O
to O
him O
to O
do O
it O
, O
like O
his O
teammates O
on O
Saturday O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
, O
no O
official O
anticipation O
on O
what O
Italy O
will O
be O
. O

" O
I O
confirm O
that O
I O
will O
change O
the O
men O
, O
but O
for O
three O
days O
I O
'm O
hammering O
the O
boys O
: O

The O
spirit O
must O
not O
change O
. O

If O
we O
do O
n't O
underestimate O
commitment O
and O
adversary O
, O
we O
can O
win O
. O

To O
do O
so O
without O
playing O
well O
, O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
is O
not O
possible O
. O

But O
for O
once O
I O
'd O
settle O
for O
that O
too O
. O

Closing O
these O
first O
10 O
days O
of O
work O
with O
a O
double O
success O
would O
be O
a O
nice O
injection O
of O
confidence O
. O

The O
same O
one O
that O
Lippi B-PER
intends O
to O
give O
to O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
, O
and O
in O
all O
probability O
to O
Gilardino B-PER
. O

" O
According O
to O
the O
philosophy O
of O
many O
- O
his O
explanation O
- O
I O
should O
confirm O
the O
11 O
players O
of O
Saturday O
as O
they O
played O
. O

I O
follow O
another O
way O
, O
and O
someone O
will O
be O
scandalized O
. O

But O
at O
almost O
60 O
years O
of O
age O
and O
with O
35 O
on O
the O
bench O
, O
it O
is O
legitimate O
to O
think O
that O
if O
a O
young O
man O
has O
given O
so O
much O
, O
beyond O
his O
possibilities O
, O
it O
is O
right O
not O
to O
burden O
him O
with O
too O
many O
expectations O
. O

It O
took O
courage O
to O
put O
him O
in O
at O
21 O
years O
old O
, O
it O
takes O
shrewdness O
now O
to O
manage O
his O
future O
. O

And O
if O
instead O
another O
youngster O
has O
suffered O
the O
emotion O
of O
his O
debut O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
reason O
to O
confirm O
it O
.... O
" O
. O

Translated O
, O
out O
of O
De B-PER
Rossi I-PER
( O
" O
yes O
, O
if O
we O
talk O
about O
him O
, O
I O
say O
that O
it O
is O
good O
for O
him O
to O
be O
out O
" O
) O
and O
still O
inside O
Gilardino B-PER
. O

Two O
opposite O
choices O
, O
but O
only O
one O
philosophy O
. O

" O
I O
ca O
n't O
afford O
to O
have O
eleven O
fixed O
players O
in O
mind O
. O

Between O
championship O
and O
cups O
the O
players O
of O
the O
great O
clubs O
will O
have O
only O
one O
free O
Wednesday O
. O

Today O
's O
soccer O
is O
more O
difficult O
: O

I O
can O
not O
think O
of O
having O
a O
team O
of O
30 O
players O
, O
but O
20 O
- O
22 O
yes O
. O

And O
also O
for O
the O
module O
: O

The O
basic O
idea O
is O
there O
, O
adaptable O
to O
the O
players O
available O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
it O
may O
be O
that O
it O
changes O
. O

Maybe O
... O
" O
. O

Inevitable O
, O
in O
any O
case O
, O
that O
the O
weak O
lights O
of O
the O
Chisinau B-LOC
stadium O
concentrate O
all O
on O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
. O

" O
However O
, O
the O
same O
thing O
applies O
to O
him O
- O
Lippi B-PER
concludes O
- O
as O
to O
Totti B-PER
. O

The O
champions O
must O
be O
taken O
out O
of O
responsibility O
. O

If O
he O
is O
no O
longer O
on O
the O
pedestal O
as O
he O
was O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
it O
is O
good O
for O
Alex B-PER
. O

He O
had O
climbed O
up O
there O
by O
himself O
, O
nobody O
had O
put O
him O
there O
: O

But O
often O
the O
champions O
are O
helped O
to O
go O
up O
, O
so O
then O
there O
is O
more O
taste O
to O
make O
them O
go O
down O
. O

Lippi B-PER
instead O
, O
while O
investing O
him O
of O
the O
mission O
of O
a O
partial O
redemption O
, O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
raise O
him O
beyond O
the O
due O
: O

that O
is O
above O
his O
concept O
of O
team O
. O

So O
it O
is O
even O
possible O
that O
he O
asks O
him O
to O
make O
second O
point O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
, O
and O
not O
only O
. O

Of O
the O
five O
expected O
changes O
, O
the O
closest O
to O
the O

are O
those O

two O

reasons O

After O

The O

the O
document O

Away O
the O

Ran O
over O
a O

without O
noticing O
anything O

Is O
it O
possible O
to O
run O
over O
a O
person O
in O
the O
city O

fracture O

, O
cause O
obvious O
damage O
to O
the O
windshield O
of O
your O
car O
and O
not O
notice O
anything O
? O

Logic O
says O
that O
it O
is O
unlikely O
, O
not O
to O
say O
impossible O
, O
but O
this O
is O
exactly O
what O
would O
have O
happened O
to O
a O
woman O
in O
Trento B-LOC

an O
eighty O

year O

now O
being O
investigated O
for O

Her O

, O
after O
the O

Bonifacio B-PER

had O
miraculously O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
her O
to O
return O
the O

by O
the O

, O
has O
now O
been O
seized O
by O
the O
judicial O
authority O
. O

A O
measure O
more O
unique O
than O
rare O
, O
ordered O
in O
haste O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
' O
basic O
consideration O
: O

If O
the O
reflexes O
of O
the O
elderly O
driver O
do O
not O
allow O
her O
to O
realize O
that O
she O
has O
hit O
a O
person O
on O
the O
road O
, O
it O
means O
that O
the O
woman O
behind O
the O
wheel O
is O
a O
danger O
to O
herself O
and O
others O
. O

And O
so O
the O
magistrate O
Marco B-PER
La I-PER
Ganga I-PER
granted O
the O
request O
of O
the O
prosecutor O
Giuseppe B-PER
De I-PER
Benedetto I-PER
who O
asked O
for O
the O
precautionary O
seizure O
of O
the O
driving O
document O
. O

The O
incident O
dates O
back O
to O
May O
21 O
last O
year O
. O

That O
day O
a O
girl O
who O
is O
taking O
driving O
lessons O
was O
about O
to O
get O
on O
the O
car O
of O
the O
school O
to O
practice O
. O

The O
car O
was O
parked O
in O
Corso O
Buonarroti O
near O
the O
intersection O
with O
Via O
Sant'Antonio O
da O
Trento B-LOC
. O

Just O
as O
the O
poor O
girl O
was O
opening O
the O
door O
of O
the O
car O
, O
a O
Fiat O
Seicento O
passed O
by O
and O
hit O
the O
girl O
throwing O
her O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

Under O
the O
astonished O
eyes O
of O
some O
witnesses O
, O
the O
investor O
did O
not O
stop O
but O
pulled O
straight O
. O

While O
the O
girl O
was O
rescued O
and O
transferred O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
for O
a O
fractured O
shoulder O
, O
the O
traffic O
police O
tried O
to O
identify O
the O
driver O
. O

The O
model O
of O
the O
car O
( O
Fiat O
Seicento O
) O
, O
the O
color O
( O
white O
) O
and O
some O
license O
plate O
numbers O
, O
led O
the O
officers O
up O
to O
V. B-PER
M. I-PER
, O
80 O
years O
old O
from O
Trento B-LOC
. O

On O
her O
Seicento O
there O
were O
still O
the O
unmistakable O
signs O
of O
the O
accident O
. O

The O
woman O
justified O
herself O
by O
saying O
that O
she O
had O
not O
noticed O
anything O
. O

This O
, O
however O
, O
did O
not O
prevent O
the O
start O
of O
an O
administrative O
procedure O
that O
led O
to O
the O
suspension O
of O
the O
driving O
licence O
by O
the O
Government B-ORG
Commissioner I-ORG
's O
Office O
. O

Against O
this O
decision O
, O
the O
lady O
's O
lawyer O
appealed O
to O
the O
Justice O
of O
the O
Peace O
who O
accepted O
the O
arguments O
of O
the O
defender O
giving O
back O
the O
license O
to O
the O
elderly O
driver O
. O

At O
this O
point O
the O
Public B-ORG
Prosecutor O
's O
Office O
intervened O
and O
opened O
a O
criminal O
proceeding O
for O
hit O
- O
and O
- O
run O
. O

For O
the O
pm O
Giuseppe B-PER
De I-PER
Benedetto I-PER
was O
not O
difficult O
to O
motivate O
the O
precautionary O
request O
: O

If O
indeed O
the O
lady O
had O
not O
noticed O
to O
have O
sent O
to O
the O
hospital O
a O
pedestrian O
, O
it O
is O
better O
perhaps O
that O
it O
leaves O
to O
lose O
the O
pantente O
and O
takes O
the O
bus O

there O
is O
a O

" O

that O

from O

A O
history O
of O
rivalry O

Between O
these O
populations O

the O
Russians O
there O
has O
always O
been O
a O
more O
or O
less O
strong O
rivalry O

But O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
1800 O
the O
situation O
degenerated O
into O
war O
when O
Russia B-LOC
tried O
to O
expand O
towards O
the O
Indian B-LOC
Ocean I-LOC

The O
Caucasians O
resisted O
for O
several O
years O

from O
1820 O
to O
1859 O

In O
1830 O
an O

an O

Some O
of O
the O
northern O
Caucasians O

the O
Ossites O

were O
less O
hostile O

" O
Here O
is O
the O
remote O
origin O
of O
the O
rivalry O
between O
Chechens O

: O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
difference O
in O
religion O
, O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
North B-LOC
Ossetia I-LOC
have O
favored O
Russian O
domination O
- O
underlines O
Bensi B-PER
- O
an O
unforgivable O
guilt O
, O
that O
the O
Ossites O
drag O
on O
until O
today O
. O

But O
the O
real O
tragedy O
of O
the O
peoples O
of O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
was O
Stalinist O
Russia B-LOC
. O

" O
In O
' O

, O
taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
confusion O
of O
the O
Russian O
Revolution O
, O
the O
peoples O
of O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
tried O
the O
road O
to O
independence O
: O

Russia B-LOC
repressed O
them O
severely O
. O

All O

reconquered O
by O

During O
World O
War O
II O
, O
when O
Hitler B-PER
raided O
Russia B-LOC

the O
Chechens O
hoped O
for O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Stalinist O
regime O
and O
supported O
the O
Nazi O
raid O

This O
was O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
Stalin B-PER
was O
ruthless O

The O
deportation O
of O
' O

" O
Stalin B-PER
, O
as O
a O
good O
Georgian O

had O
a O
particular O
hatred O
for O
those O
who O

from O
his O
point O

were O
only O
rough O
mountain O

- O
says O
Bensi B-PER
- O
the O
deportation O
to O
Siberia B-LOC
was O
organized O
starting O
from O
1944 O

For O
the O
transport O
they O
used O
freight O

ended O
up O

many O

died O
during O
the O

In O

the O
victims O
were O
1,600,000 O
of O
which O
at O

600,000 O
were O
Chechens O

The O
survivors O
were O
able O
to O
return O
home O
only O
after O
the O
20th O
Congress O

the O
Communist B-ORG

where O
Nikita B-PER
Chruschev I-PER
in O
1956 O
denounced O
the O
faults O
of O
Stalin B-PER
. O

" O
Almost O
all O
current O
Chechen O
leaders O
were O
born O
during O
the O
deportation O
: O

this O
can O
explain O
the O
anger O
that O
is O
experienced O
in O
Chechnya B-LOC

In O
1993 O
, O
after O
the O
fall O

the O
only O

out O

the O

In O

there O
is O
one O
more O
detail O
that O
can O

looking O
back O
: O

Why O
the O
school O

" O
It O
is O
not O
accidental O

Some O
say O
that O
the O

chose O
it O
because O
they O
found O

But O
it O

" O
At O
a O
certain O
point O
the O
Chechens O
remembered O

were O
Muslims O

will O

up O

the O
commission B-ORG

the O

The O
following O

( O

perhaps O
the O
following O

will O
be O
the O
phase O
of O

Therefore O
, O
by O
the O

Then O
, O
so O
that O
the O
interventions O
included O
in O
the O

actually O
be O

The O
questions O

these O
: O

What O
kind O
of O
trend O
do O
community O

reveal O
for O
the O
evolution O
of O

and O

in O

? O

After O
having O
considered O

for O
decades O
as O
a O
factor O
of O
homologation O
and O
globalization O
, O
are O
we O
facing O
a O
rediscovery O
of O
a O
" O
local O
" O
dimension O
of O

? O

The O
round O
table O
began O
with O
the O

of O
Massimo B-PER
Arvat I-PER
who O
brought O
his O
experience O
as O
a O
producer O
of O
community O
television O
in O
Piedmont B-LOC
. O

In O
Piedmont O
, O
local O
communities O
were O
able O
to O
create O
a O
" O
popular O
" O
network O
- O
first O
created O
by O
simple O
citizens O
, O
then O
by O
environmental O
associations O
and O
then O
by O
a O
diverse O
group O
of O
associations O
and O
spontaneous O
groups O
- O
resulting O
in O
a O
daily O
half O
- O
hour O
program O
that O
was O
also O
broadcast O
by O
provincial O
TV O
stations O
. O

The O
model O
was O
concretized O
in O
a O
talk O
show O
that O
dealt O
with O
problems O
linked O
to O
the O
territory O
and O
that O
was O
realized O
in O
a O
public O
place O
. O

" O
Television O
- O
said O
the O
producer O
- O
is O
an O
instrument O
that O
must O
serve O
above O
all O
to O
put O
people O
in O
communication O
. O

People O
who O
are O
different O

who O
, O
through O

Andrea B-PER
Melodia I-PER
instead O
spoke O
about O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O

model O
and O
its O
prospects O
: O

From O
its O
debut O
that O
saw O
it O
as O
a O
creator O
of O
mass O
communication O
, O
to O
the O
attempt O
of O
the O
seventies O
of O
decentralization O
( O
with O
the O
birth O
and O
then O
the O
death O
of O

) O
, O
to O
the O
scenarios O
of O
tomorrow O
's O
TV O
that O
will O
no O
longer O
be O
articulated O
in O
channels O
but O
rather O
managed O
by O
links O
. O

The O
trend O
will O
then O
be O
that O
of O
a O
television O
with O
universal O
coverage O
that O
lives O
thanks O
to O
a O
universal O
production O
. O

" O
These O
networks O
- O
concluded O
Melodia B-PER
- O
will O
have O
a O
longer O

long O
as O

will O
be O

These O

very O

a O

Communism O
was O
in O
some O
way O
a O
necessary O
evil O
for O
the O

for O

This O
is O
what O
John B-PER

which O
was O

yesterday O

In O
the O
early O
post O

says O
the O
Pope O
in O
this O
book O
that O
examines O
the O
major O
problems O

and O
responds O
to O
the O
deepest O
questions O

" O
it O
was O
immediately O
clear O
that O
this O

last O

noting O
that O

Quoting O
Goethe B-PER

Faust O
, O
the O
Holy O
Father O
recalls O
how O
the O
devil O
can O
also O
be O
defined O
as O
" O
a O
part O
of O
that O
force O
which O
always O
wants O
evil O

always O
does O
good O

As O
for O
Nazism O
, O
the O
Holy O
Father O
points O
out O
that O
at O
the O
time O
, O
" O
the O
real O
dimension O
of O
the O
evil O
that O
raged O
in O
Europe B-LOC
was O
not O
perceived O
by O
everyone O
, O
not O
even O
by O
those O
of O
us O
who O
lived O
at O

center O
of O
that O
vortex O

admitting O
that O
" O
for O

long O
time O
the O

not O

the O

This O
is O
an O
international O
debut O
for O
the O
young O

from O

, O
who O
until O
now O
had O
never O
gone O
beyond O
the O
European O

Already O
this O

be O
in O

The O

on O
Saturday O
will O
certainly O
be O

- O
warns O
Alberto B-PER
Betta I-PER
, O
responsible O
for O

- O
because O
, O
in O

promote O
the O

only O
one O

that O

planned O
this O

information O
to O
drum O
beating O
, O
to O
convince O
more O
over O
65 O
years O
to O
get O
vaccinated O
. O

" O
Our O
commitment O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
major O
diseases O
are O
addressed O
in O
a O
general O
context O
of O

the O

Andreolli B-PER
- O
For O

the O
' O
goal O
to O
be O
achieved O
is O
to O
protect O
70 O
% O
of O
the O

population O
. O

The O
' O
Health B-ORG
Authority I-ORG
has O
purchased O
70,000 O

invested O
33,500 O

for O

information O
. O

In O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
the O
adherence O
is O
good O
, O
last O
year O
we O
vaccinated O
64,000 O
people O
, O
that O
is O
, O
just O
under O
60 O

of O
the O
over-65 O

, O
" O
says O
Valter B-PER
Carraro I-PER
, O
head O
of O

hygiene O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
, O
we O
must O
vaccinate O
more O
elderly O
people O
and O
even O
more O
people O
at O
risk O
with O
less O
than O
65 O
years O

VACCINATIONS O
FROM O

: O

The O
start O
throughout O

Earlier O
, O
from O

, O
however O
, O
will O
be O

people O
born O
in O

FAMILY O
DOCTORS O
: O

The O
real O
news O
this O
year O
' O
is O
that O
the O
vaccination O
can O
also O
be O
performed O
by O
the O
family O
doctor O
. O

" O
It O
starts O
with O
some O
doctors O
who O
have O
given O
their O
availability O
- O
explains O
Fabio B-PER
Branz I-PER
, O
president O
of O
the O
' O
Order B-ORG
of I-ORG
doctors I-ORG
- O
but O
already O
next O
year O
this O
activity O
of O
vaccination O
of O
patients O
will O
become O
systematic O
. O

Until O
now O
, O
family O
physicians O
ensured O
vaccination O
at O
home O
of O
patients O
unable O
to O
travel O
; O

With O
the O
new O
agreements O
, O
we O
will O
try O
to O
make O
the O
vaccination O
of O
at O
- O
risk O
patients O
one O
of O
the O
therapies O
that O
family O
doctors O
routinely O
perform O
. O

In O
this O
way O
it O
is O
hoped O
to O
give O
a O
further O
boost O
to O
the O
vaccination O
activity O
: O

The O
patient O
, O
relying O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
his O
doctor O
, O
will O
certainly O
find O
it O
easier O
, O
but O
also O
more O
comfortable O
, O
to O
adhere O
. O

Since O
1996 O
, O
the O
number O
of O
over O
65 O
vaccinated O
against O
influenza O
has O
doubled O
from O
32,286 O
to O
63,360 O
in O
2003 O
. O

But O
there O
are O
also O
10,000 O
people O
in O
Trentino O
who O
, O
although O
not O
considered O
at O
risk O
, O
do O
not O
want O
to O
know O
about O
catching O
the O
flu O
and O
buy O
the O
vaccine O
at O
the O
pharmacy O
. O

INFORMATION O
: O

is O
entrusted O
to O
1,500 O
posters O
and O
70,000 O
leaflets O
distributed O
in O
hospitals O
, O

Another O
2,000 O

up O

rivaled O

with O
the O
Italian O

foreign O
players O
of O

and O
who O
today O
is O
in O

did O

I O
'm O
still O

it O
's O
because O
Forl√¨ B-ORG

Corigliano B-ORG
did O
n't O
seem O
like O

Does O
this O
mean O
that O
you O
have O
decided O
not O
to O
go O
down O
in O
A2 B-ORG
? O

" O
No O
, O
it O
just O
means O
that O
my O
goal O
is O
to O
see O
the O
conditions O
guaranteed O
by O
the O
contract O
with O
Trentino B-ORG
Volley I-ORG
respected O

And O
it O
's O
an O

in O
all O
its O

. O

Yet O
Corigliano B-ORG
had O
officially O
announced O
your O

seemed O
like O

" O
The O
society O
has O
been O
really O
incautious O
to O
communicate O
that O
the O
operation O
was O
successful O
. O

I O
had O
told O
the O
president O
from O

beginning O
that O
even O
if O
he O
had O
found O
an O
agreement O

would O
have O
been O
mine O

newly O
promoted O
team O
, O
it O
still O
has O
to O
make O
its O
bones O
at O
these O
levels O

If O
I O
have O
to O
go O
down O
in O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
do O
it O
for O

" O
A O

team O
of O

I O
immediately O
gave O

Trento B-LOC

to O
be O
the O
right O

What O
happened O
instead O
? O

" O
Well O
, O
leaving O
aside O
the O
shoulder O
injury O
that O
kept O
me O
away O
for O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
, O
it O
happened O
that O
I O
played O
very O
little O
. O

Staying O
always O
on O
the O
bench O
is O
penalizing O
, O
because O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
habit O
to O
play O
with O
your O
teammates O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
certain O
automatisms O
, O
in O
the O
field O
you O
feel O
lost O
. O

In O
the O
playoffs O
, O
moreover O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
in O

practically O

It O
would O
have O
been O
difficult O

The O
difference O
between O

all O

And O
now O
what O
happens O
? O

" O
I O
'm O
training O
with O
the O
boys O
. O

I O
put O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
into O
it O
because O
I O
know O
it O
serves O
me O
and O
them O
. O

I O
realize O
that O
Trentino B-ORG

is O
making O
an O
economic O
sacrifice O
, O
because O
it O

when O
the O

will O
reopen O
( O
after O

expect O
to O
find O

is O
made O
of O

material O

, O
therefore O
, O
has O
the O
same O
consistency O
and O
volatility O
, O
has O
theorized O
substantially O
Shakespeare B-PER
in O
" O
The O

" O
, O
suggesting O
to O
many O
other O
artists O
reflections O
of O
great O
suggestion O
that O
have O
expanded O
, O
refined O
and O
multiplied O
with O
the O
emergence O
of O
psychoanalysis O
( O
where O
dreams O
are O
often O
to O
enclose O
the O
explanations O
of O

) O
and O
, O
more O
generally O
, O
the O
expressions O
of O
modern O
culture O
( O
scientific O

non O

scientific O
) O
that O
explore O
the O
latencies O
, O
how O
much O
has O
a O
strong O
cognitive O
charge O
but O
that O
we O
keep O
( O
more O
or O
less O
voluntarily O
) O
hidden O
, O
the O
border O
territories O
of O

and O

where O

is O
difficult O
if O
not O
impossible O
. O

On O
this O
terrain O
full O
of O
pitfalls O
has O
ventured O

Kim B-PER

who O
has O
received O
numerous O
international O
awards O
and O

in O

for O
" O
The O

( O
a O
moving O
story O
of O
loneliness O
, O
violence O
and O
sex O
) O
tells O
in O
a O
tight O
manner O
a O
fairy O
tale O
for O
adults O
rich O
in O
metaphorical O
stimuli O
with O
nuanced O
meanings O
that O
do O
not O
allow O
themselves O
to O
be O
interpreted O
by O
the O
viewer O
; O

pushing O
him O
, O
in O
this O
way O
, O
to O
venture O
into O
the O
gray O
areas O
and O
accept O
- O
as O
he O
writes O
explicitly O
before O
the O
credits O
- O
that O
the O
things O
of O
the O
world O
we O
can O
only O
say O
we O
do O
not O
know O
if O
they O
are O
dreams O
or O
reality O
, O
illusions O
or O
concrete O
experiences O
. O

The O
protagonist O
( O
who O
significantly O
never O
speaks O
) O
is O
a O
young O
man O
with O
many O
talents O
who O
spends O
every O
night O
in O
houses O
left O
temporarily O
empty O
( O
even O
if O
only O
for O
a O
few O
days O
for O
a O
business O
trip O
and O
a O
vacation O
) O
by O
those O
who O
normally O
live O
there O
. O

In O
each O
house O
he O
behaves O
as O
if O
it O
were O
his O
definitive O
home O
, O
he O
puts O
everything O
in O
order O
, O
repairs O
what O
is O
broken O
, O
fills O
it O
with O
warmth O
and O
fantasy O
. O

In O
this O
pilgrimage O
he O
enters O
an O
elegant O
house O
where O
there O
is O
an O
unhappy O
woman O
with O
a O
face O
marked O
by O
her O
husband O
's O
blows O
. O

As O
if O
he O
were O
a O
generous O
imp O
, O
he O
makes O
her O
feel O
different O
, O
respected O
and O
loved O
. O

She O
decides O
to O
follow O
him O
in O
his O
visits O
to O
homes O
that O
often O
contain O
loneliness O
, O
misunderstandings O
and O
bitterness O
. O

They O
are O
discovered O
and O
he O
ends O
up O
in O
jail O
; O

The O
policemen O
and O
guards O
are O
not O
kind O
. O

But O
the O
young O
man O
learns O
to O
be O
physically O
present O
without O
being O
seen O
by O
others O
, O
if O
not O
by O
the O
woman O
he O
has O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
and O
who O
loves O
him O
. O

Perhaps O
happiness O
or O
, O
less O
ambitiously O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
face O
existence O
serenely O
implies O
taking O
possession O
of O
what O
we O
are O
able O
to O
grasp O
around O
and O
within O
us O
, O
not O
to O
emphasize O
the O
physical O
reality O
, O
to O
reinvent O
it O
with O
feelings O
and O
subjective O
creativity O
, O
to O
live O
life O
to O
the O
full O
by O
animating O
it O
with O
desires O
, O
hopes O
and O
dreams O
. O

An O
extraordinary O
work O
of O
great O
charm O
that O
the O
director O
has O
been O
able O
to O
stage O
effectively O
connecting O
it O
with O
some O
concrete O
aspects O
of O
everyday O
life O
in O
his O
country O
. O

The O

active O

raw O
and O
obsessive O
. O

" O

of O
a O
group O
of O
Estonian O
girls O
that O
a O
young O
American O
has O
convinced O
to O
reach O
Palestine B-LOC

After O
being O
driven O
through O

they O
are O
sold O
and O
forced O
into O
prostitution O
, O
first O
in O
the O

by O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
authorities I-LOC
and O
then O
in O
those O
of O
Israel B-LOC

Palestine B-LOC
, O
the O
director O
seems O
to O
want O
to O
highlight O
, O
is O
not O
a O
promised O
land O
either O
for O
the O
Jews O
or O
for O
these O
girls O
who O
are O
treated O
as O
if O
they O
were O
things O
( O
the O
reference O
to O
the O
lager O
and O
the O
Kapo O
is O
highlighted O
on O
several O
occasions O
) O
. O

Faithful O
to O
his O
style O
, O
Gitai B-PER
alternates O
long O
sequences O
shot O
with O
the O
camera O
in O
motion O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
used O
by O
hand O
, O
with O
the O
images O
fragmented O
in O
their O
course O
that O
deliberately O
make O
the O
viewer O
uncomfortable O
, O
with O
sequence O
plans O
in O
which O
the O
words O
of O
the O
characters O
come O
to O
assume O
the O
descriptive O
hardness O
of O
their O
states O
of O
mind O
and O
their O
conditions O
. O

A O
' O
work O
interesting O
and O
engaging O
, O
although O
too O
repetitive O
and O
insistent O
in O
language O
and O
thematization O
. O

We O
were O
personally O
more O
than O
disappointed O
by O

of O
which O
are O
the O
result O
of O

of O
one O
of O

, O
it O
would O
probably O
like O
to O
be O
a O
paradoxical O
and O
merciless O
satire O
of O
the O
other O

one O
that O

not O
cultivate O

of O

to O
redeem O
its O

with O
radical O
choices O
such O
as O

for O

, O
those O
of O

a O

another O
war O

the O
fourth O

which O
really O
involves O
all O

the O
role O
that O
the O

" O
Several O

I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O

go O
beyond O

the O
two O

the O
vigilance O
guaranteed O
in O

by O
the O
three O

The O
hostesses O
, O
who O
started O
yesterday O
the O

, O
are O
instead O
the O
operators O

the O
Consortium B-ORG

, O
which O
has O
been O
entrusted O
with O
the O
administrative O
acceptance O
of O
patients O
entering O
the O
emergency O

At O
the O
S. O
Chiara O
the O
hostesses O
are O
not O
a O
novelty O
, O
already O
for O
some O
time O
they O
are O
in O

to O
the O
job O
to O
the O
center B-ORG
information I-ORG

reception I-ORG
( O
Cirp B-ORG
) O
in O
the O
atrium O
of O
the O

. O

The O
new O
operators O
will O
cover O
two O
shifts O
, O
distributed O
in O
the O
hours O
8 O
- O
20 O
, O
with O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
overlap O
for O
the O
handover O

They O
are O
currently O
working O
on O
the O
insertion O
of O
the O
new O
staff O
, O
alongside O
the O
experienced O
nurses O
of O
the O
reception O
. O

" O
With O
the O
14 O
they O
should O
already O
be O
autonomous O
to O
be O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
administrative O
activity O
- O
explains O
the O
primary O
, O
Pierluigi B-PER
Torboli I-PER
- O
so O
that O
the O
nurses O
of O
the O
triage O
can O
carry O
out O
in O
a O
wider O
way O
their O
own O
specific O
competence O
. O

The O
hostesses O
will O
be O
able O
to O
make O
only O
the O
administrative O
acceptance O
, O
that O
is O
to O
collect O
the O
personal O
data O
of O
the O
patients O
and O
to O
compile O
the O
card O
of O
acceptance O
, O
with O
the O
modalities O
of O
arrival O
, O
the O
origin O
, O
the O
typology O
of O
the O
incident O
. O

" O
Of O
course O
, O
there O
are O
no O
red O
codes O
that O
enter O
directly O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
and O
also O
other O
patients O
who O
present O
particular O
symptoms O
( O
chest O
pain O
, O
fainting O
, O
breathing O
difficulties O
) O
or O
who O
arrive O
on O
a O
stretcher O
and O
go O
immediately O
to O
triage O
- O
continues O
Torboli B-PER
- O
. O

But O
all O
the O
others O
do O
the O
administrative O
acceptance O
first O
" O
. O

In O
this O
first O
phase O
, O
the O
hostesses O
of O
the O
reception O
will O
be O
sacrificed O
in O
the O
space O
now O
assigned O
to O
the O
porters O
. O

The O
big O
problem O
we O
have O
is O
space O
, O
" O
says O
Torboli B-PER
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
until O
there O
is O
a O
complete O
renovation O
of O
the O
emergency O
room O
, O
in O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
, O
there O
is O
no O
solution O
. O

After O
that O
it O
will O
be O
a O
different O
story O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
we O
are O
trying O
to O
rationalize O
accesses O
, O
also O
by O
agreeing O
on O
new O
procedures O
with O
the O
head O
of O
the O
118 B-ORG
for O
patients O
arriving O
by O
ambulance O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
administrative O
side O
is O
concerned O
, O
the O
entrusting O
of O
this O
activity O
to O
the O
hostesses O
is O
in O
response O
to O
a O
request O
made O
by O
the O
nurses O
themselves O
, O
and O
which O
has O
seen O
the O
commitment O
of O
hospital O
director O
Baldantoni B-PER
. O

" O
The O
big O
result O
that O
we O
think O
we O
will O
obtain O
is O
the O
extra O
time O
that O
the O
triage O
nurses O
will O
be O
able O
to O
dedicate O
to O
the O
patients O
who O
are O
waiting O
to O
be O
seen O
- O
concludes O
Torboli B-PER
- O
. O

We O
will O
be O
able O
to O
anticipate O
some O
procedures O
and O
the O
time O
needed O
to O
send O
the O
patients O
. O

The O
fallout O
will O
certainly O
be O
good O
, O
both O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
work O
of O
the O
nurse O
and O
for O
the O
patient O
who O
will O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
be O
checked O
again O
and O
will O
see O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service O
improve O
during O
the O
wait O
" O
. O

A O
' O
further O
step O
will O
see O
the O
' O
assignment O
of O
some O
operators O
Oss O
to O
follow O
people O
waiting O

complete O
checks O

" O
The O
intent O
of O
this O
conference O
- O
said O
Renzo B-PER
De I-PER
Stefani I-PER
, O
head O
of O
the O
mental B-ORG
health I-ORG
service I-ORG
- O
is O
to O
create O
a O
private O
and O
protected O
space O
, O
where O
for O
once O
the O
walls O
erected O
between O
operators O
and O
patients O
fall O
. O

It O
wants O
to O
be O
the O
keystone O
to O
ensure O
that O
everyone O
can O
learn O
from O
everyone O
, O
so O
that O
everyone O
is O
aware O
of O
making O
a O
positive O
contribution O
to O
collaborate O
to O
build O
something O
. O

Yesterday O
afternoon O
, O
space O
was O
given O
to O
the O
protagonists O
, O
to O
those O
who O
live O
firsthand O

" O
Healing O
from O
Mental O
Illness O
" O
and O
of O
a O
manual O
for O
" O
voice O
hearers O
" O
spoke O
. O

A O
patient O
himself O
, O
he O
recounted O
his O
experience O
of O
a O
sick O
person O
who O
has O
been O
left O
to O
his O
own O
devices O
and O
medications O
. O

Coleman B-PER
emphasized O
that O
in O
order O
to O
get O
better O
, O
the O
patient O
needs O
to O
talk O
, O
to O
be O
listened O
to O
, O
to O
find O
an O
attentive O
interlocutor O
who O
has O
the O
patience O
to O
pay O
attention O
. O

There O
were O
many O
patients O
present O
who O
wanted O
to O
bring O
their O
experience O
to O
share O
with O
others O
. O

From O
their O
stories O
emerged O
a O
situation O
of O
deep O
initial O
discomfort O
not O
always O
understood O
, O
many O
of O
them O
said O
they O
had O
been O
in O
treatment O
for O
over O
twenty O
years O
without O
being O
able O
to O
achieve O
any O
improvement O
. O

All O
of O
them O
agreed O
in O
affirming O
that O
they O
had O
found O
a O
new O
desire O
to O
" O
fight O
" O
and O
to O
feel O
like O
real O
people O
thanks O
to O
the O
assistance O
of O
self O
- O
help O
groups O
. O

" O
They O
were O
able O
- O
said O
Alessandro B-PER
- O
to O
give O
meaning O
to O
my O
time O
, O
to O
animate O
my O
days O
, O
to O
give O
order O
to O
my O
life O
, O
to O
give O
a O
reason O
for O
my O
actions O
, O
to O
find O
the O
affection O
and O
love O
that O
I O
had O
denied O
myself O
. O

Great O
interest O
also O
among O
the O
operators O

" O
Patients O
with O
severe O
personality O
disorders O
and O
schizophrenia O
- O
he O
said O
- O
are O
increasingly O
on O
the O
rise O
, O
perhaps O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
our O
societies O
are O
increasingly O
individualistic O
and O
there O
is O
never O
time O
to O
listen O
to O
someone O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
only O
33 O
% O
of O
cases O
can O
be O
cured O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
working O
with O
this O
type O
of O
patient O
it O
is O
important O
to O
listen O
and O
try O
to O
identify O
with O
them O
, O
with O
their O
problems O
. O

Today O
, O
the O
chapter O
on O
the O
" O

will O
be O
considered O

Prodi B-PER
explained O

Prodi B-PER
spoke O
of O
" O
grey O
areas O
" O
that O
need O
to O
be O
cleared O
up O
and O
defined O
the O
conditions O
as O
" O
obvious O
precautions O
to O
prevent O
Turkey B-LOC

integration O
from O

the O
construction O

have O
been O
undertaking O
for O

fifty O

Among O
the O
precautions O
is O
the O
request O
not O
to O
include O
Turkey B-LOC
in O
the O
financial O
perspective O
2007 O
- O
2013 O

to O

only O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O

This O
means O
that O
, O
in O
the O
most O
optimistic O
version O
, O
Turkey B-LOC
will O
not O
enter O
the O
EU B-LOC
before O
2014 O
. O

And O
among O
the O
precautions O
is O
the O
inclusion O

all O

In O
a O
symbolic O
way O
the O
performance O
describes O
the O
process O
- O
the O
title O
is O
Kafkaesque O
- O
to O

by O

, O
a O

, O
as O
Demers B-PER
puts O
it O
. O

But O
how O
are O
these O
robots O
? O

First O
of O
all O
, O
they O
do O
not O
have O
human O
features O
, O
they O
remind O
us O
of O
industrial O
machines O
and O
their O
behavior O
does O
not O
tend O
to O
reproduce O
that O
of O
man O
. O

They O
continue O
in O
their O
ability O
to O
coordinate O
, O
in O
their O
mechanicality O
to O
respond O
to O
stimuli O
as O
programmed O
. O

Yet O
these O
howling O
and O
noisy O
creatures O
seem O
to O
suffer O
their O
condition O
of O
perpetual O
movement O
, O
they O
seem O
forced O
to O
sustain O
the O
dance O
, O
a O
terrifying O
dance O
that O
, O
quoting O
Arnd B-PER
Wesemann I-PER
, O
" O
denies O
death O
to O
the O
dead O
" O
. O

A O
machine O
attached O
to O
the O
wall O
is O
shaken O
by O
spasmodic O
movements O

It O
moves O
independently O
, O

whose O
origin O

Is O
this O
intentional O
or O
are O
these O
movements O
without O
purpose O
? O

With O
Demers B-PER
, O
any O
attempt O
to O
attribute O
intentionality O
to O
the O
actors O
- O
robots O
fails O
, O
and O
above O
all O
, O
the O
behavior O
of O
the O
machines O
remains O
indecipherable O
to O
us O
because O
it O
can O
not O
be O
assimilated O
to O
human O
behavior O
. O

Each O
machine O
has O
its O
own O
task O
to O
perform O

its O
own O
cognitive O
skills O
to O
be O
supported O
in O

the O

It O

Who O
killed O
√ñtzi B-PER

Who O
was O

? O

Was O
he O
a O
tribal O
chief O
, O
a O
shaman O
or O
a O
shepherd O
? O

A O
mystery O
that O
is O
more O
than O
5000 O
years O
old O
, O
which O
was O
the O
theme O
of O
the O
Retrospective O
" O

, O

After O
the O
screening O

the O

" O
The O
Iceman O
" O
by O
Brando B-PER
Quilici I-PER
, O
the O
debate O
opened O
with O
the O
archaeologist O
Umberto B-PER
Tecchiati I-PER
, O
of O
the O
Archaeological B-ORG
Heritage I-ORG
Office I-ORG
of O
Bolzano B-LOC
. O

According O
to O
medical O
analysis O
, O
the O
Iceman O
was O
certainly O
killed O
by O
an O
arrow O
that O
struck O
him O
in O
the O
back O
. O

But O
who O
was O
he O
? O

Surely O
- O
said O
the O
expert O
- O
he O
was O
a O
man O
of O
rank O
: O

He O
carried O
an O
object O
reserved O
for O
the O
highest O
class O
, O
a O
copper O
axe O
. O

In O
his O
hands O
he O
held O
a O
dagger O
, O
and O
his O
body O
shows O
obvious O
signs O
of O
struggle O
. O

The O
most O
recent O
hypotheses O
speak O
of O
a O
shepherd O
, O
murdered O
for O
his O
flocks O
. O

" O
But O
if O
so O
- O
Tecchiati B-PER
explained O
- O
why O
did O
n't O
they O
steal O
the O
axe O
, O
an O
object O
of O
enormous O
value O
at O
the O
time O
? O

" O

Another O
hypothesis O
speaks O
of O
a O
shaman O
, O
a O
man O
of O
religion O
who O
would O
have O
immolated O
himself O
for O
his O
people O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
explained O
, O
even O
in O
this O
case O
, O
the O
' O
weaponry O
with O
which O
he O
was O
equipped O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
and O
the O
shot O
in O
the O
back O
. O

According O
to O
Tecchiati B-PER
, O
it O
was O
certainly O
a O
man O
of O
high O
rank O
, O
a O
survivor O
, O
since O
in O
an O
era O
in O
which O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
reach O
thirty O
years O
, O
Oetzi B-PER
died O
murdered O
at O
an O
age O
of O
over O
40 O
. O

The O
scarce O
wear O
and O
tear O
of O
the O
bones O
of O
the O
joints O
denotes O
a O
life O
devoid O
of O
physical O
stress O
, O
therefore O
excludes O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
the O
shepherd O
. O

The O
mystery O
of O
√ñtzi B-PER
continues O
to O
fascinate O
researchers O
, O
and O
is O
destined O
to O
keep O
alive O

to O

twice O
a O

It O
happened O
in O
the O
division O
of O
Pediatric O
Oncohaematology O
of O
the O
Policlinico O
" O
San O
Matteo O
" O
of O
Pavia B-LOC
and O
in O
a O
way O
that O
has O
all O
the O
characteristics O
of O
a O
scientific O
enterprise O
, O
because O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O

An O
event O
that O
has O
been O
called O
" O
historic O
" O
by O
the O
Minister O

, O
Girolamo B-PER
Sirchia I-PER
, O
because O
it O
opens O
the O
door O
to O

clinical O
use O
, O
even O
in O
' O

, O
amplifying O
the O
number O
, O
to O
have O
greater O
certainty O
of O
' O
rooting O
. O

But O
let O
's O
recapitulate O
the O
story O
. O

Prof. O
Franco B-PER
Locatelli I-PER
, O
director O
of O
the O
division O
, O
last O
November O
received O
in O
his O
study O
a O
couple O
of O
parents O
. O

They O
live O
in O
a O
town O
in O
Lombardy B-LOC
, O
they O
are O
healthy O
carriers O
of O
Thalassemia O
Mayor O
and O
their O
child O
, O
Luca B-PER
, O
five O
years O
old O
, O
is O
thalassemic O
. O

But O
the O
parents O
, O
knowing O
that O
they O
have O
a O
3 O
in O
4 O
chance O
that O
their O
next O
child O
will O
be O
healthy O
, O
have O
decided O
to O
try O
again O
: O

In O
fact O
the O
lady O
is O
pregnant O
at O
the O
fourth O
month O
. O

She O
is O
expecting O
perfectly O
healthy O
dizygotic O
twins O
. O

The O
application O
of O
the O
couple O
- O
who O
was O
evidently O
referred O
to O
Pavia B-LOC
by O
a O
well O
- O
informed O
family O
doctor O
- O
is O
full O
of O
hope O
: O

Can O
the O
twins O
who O
are O
about O
to O
be O
born O
help O
their O
little O
brother O
? O

Locatelli B-PER
knows O
it O
well O
: O

as O
healthy O
and O
compatible O
with O
little O
Luca B-PER
, O
the O
twins O
are O
suitable O
for O
a O
stem O
cell O
transplant O
. O

They O
were O
born O
in O
April O
, O
at O
the O
Obstetric O
and O
Gynecological O
Clinic O
of O
San O
Matteo O
and O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
delivery O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
two O
umbilical O
cords O
was O
frozen O
and O
set O
aside O
. O

But O
at O
a O
first O
examination O
it O
is O
discovered O
that O
one O
of O
the O
two O
is O
rich O
in O
stem O
cells O
, O
the O
other O
is O
poor O
. O

For O
Locatelli B-PER
this O
is O
the O
right O
opportunity O
not O
to O
limit O
himself O
to O
a O
transplant O
with O
the O
unit O
rich O
in O
stem O
cells O
, O
but O
also O
to O
use O
the O
other O
one O
( O
equally O
compatible O
) O
, O
after O
subjecting O
it O
to O
the O
amplification O
of O
the O
number O
of O
stem O
cells O
. O

" O
In O
this O
way O
- O
said O
the O
doctor O
from O
Pavia O
- O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
verify O
, O
through O
appropriate O
molecular O
investigations O
, O
the O
contribution O
of O
both O
placental O
supply O
chains O
, O
those O
of O
the O
unit O
rich O
in O
stem O
cells O
but O
also O
that O
of O
the O
poorer O
unit O
, O
whose O
stem O
cells O
have O
grown O
in O
number O
in O
vitro O
. O

And O
for O
the O
first O
time O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
even O
the O
units O
expanded O
in O
vitro O
can O
contribute O
to O
the O
' O
rooting O
of O
stem O
cells O
. O
Then O
diversified O
to O
form O
healthy O
red O
blood O
cells O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
double O
transplantation O
, O
which O
took O
place O
on O
August O
12 O
, O
after O
the O
number O
of O
stem O
cells O
from O
the O
poorest O
cord O
in O
15 O

had O
been O

Luca B-PER
had O

( O

I O
would O

As O

I O
would O
like O
to O
be O
recognized O
, O
in O
terms O

The O
above O
obviously O
serves O
only O
as O
a O
benevolent O
provocation O
to O
get O
then O
to O
the O
core O
of O
the O
issue O
above O
exposed O
on O
the O
General B-ORG
Management I-ORG
of O
the O
Company B-ORG
. O

Can O
anyone O
really O
believe O
that O
all O
of O
the O
above O
is O
feasible O
or O
not O
depending O
on O
the O
characteristics O
and O
propensities O
of O
the O
General O
Manager O
? O

It O
is O
evident O
that O
the O
General O
Manager O
of O
the O
Provincial O
Health O
Service O
can O
influence O
many O
of O
these O
aspects O
, O
both O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
citizen O
- O
user O
and O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
citizen O
- O
employee O
of O
the O
Health O
Service O
, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
bring O
to O
the O
discussion O
the O
conviction O
that O
whoever O
directs O
the O
Health B-ORG
Service I-ORG
must O
follow O
the O
directives O
of O
those O
who O
, O
by O
their O
own O
institutional O
mandate O
, O
must O
take O
charge O
of O
the O
Health B-ORG
Service I-ORG
as O
a O
whole O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
the O
Politicians O
. O

The O
politician O
must O
tell O
the O
Director O
General O
which O
way O
to O
go O
and O
must O
put O
in O
place O
checks O
that O
allow O
him O
to O
have O
information O
back O
to O
correct O
any O
digressions O
from O
the O
program O
. O

The O
operational O
part O
of O
the O
management O
must O
be O
guided O
by O
the O
political O
part O
, O
which O
has O
the O
delicate O
task O
of O
making O
compatible O
the O
different O
requests O
, O
sometimes O
conflicting O
, O
of O
the O
citizens O
towards O
the O
Public O
Health O
Service O
. O

The O
politician O
must O
listen O
to O
everyone O
, O
but O
it O
is O
then O
fatal O
that O
he O
must O
take O
decisions O
that O
can O
not O
satisfy O
everyone O
. O

The O
mandate O
must O
be O
clear O
and O
the O
instruments O
for O
measuring O
results O
must O
be O
equally O
explicit O
. O

It O
is O
unthinkable O
that O
the O
work O
of O
the O
General O
Manager O
should O
be O
evaluated O
only O
when O
the O
mandate O
is O
about O
to O
expire O
; O

The O
Policy O
should O
have O
a O
constant O
feedback O
on O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
Health B-ORG
Care I-ORG
System I-ORG
, O
both O
from O
those O
who O
produce O
the O
services O
and O
those O
who O
use O
them O
. O

As O
for O
the O
collaborators O
of O
the O
General O
Director O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
the O
aprioristic O
positions O
of O
those O
who O
believe O
that O
only O
outside O
Trentino B-LOC
can O
one O
find O
managers O
of O
a O
certain O
professional O
depth O
must O
be O
rejected O
; O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
promoting O
" O
Trentino O
- O
ness O
" O
as O
such O
as O
a O
judgment O
of O
merit O
must O
be O
rejected O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
it O
is O
the O
political O
- O
legislative O
framework O
that O
ensures O
that O
the O
Director O
General O
surrounds O
himself O
with O
trusted O
collaborators O
and O
it O
is O
therefore O
consequent O
that O
the O
choice O
is O
made O
according O
to O
certain O
criteria O
. O

The O
policy O
must O
therefore O
give O
precise O
directives O
and O
monitor O
their O
application O
, O
looking O
for O
corrective O
measures O
to O
those O
dysfunctions O
that O
ten O
years O
of O
socialization O
of O
health O
care O
may O
have O
highlighted O
. O

This O
is O
a O
process O
that O
is O
still O
unfinished O

with O
both O
general O

local O
aspects O

To O
think O
that O
the O
dismissal O
of O
the O
current O
General O

represents O
the O
magic O
solution O
to O
the O
problems O
of O

is O
an O
illusion O
. O

To O
govern O
an O
imposing O
machine O
like O
the O
Trentino O

, O
there O
is O
also O
the O
need O
to O
know O
the O

the O

First O
as O
a O

" O
I O
used O
to O
come O
from O

a O
beautiful O
old O

still O

When O
did O
he O
prepare O
the O
" O
Rejected O

" O
? O

" O
In O
2001 O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
make O
a O
crucifix O
for O
the O
new O
church O
in O
Villazzano B-LOC

I O
made O
it O
in O
polychrome O
iron O
, O
one O
meter O
and O
sixty O
centimeters O
by O
one O
meter O
and O
fifty O
. O

But O
the O
Curia B-ORG

liturgical I-ORG
commission I-ORG
gave O
a O
negative O
opinion O
: O
" O
Too O
painful O
" O
. O

A O
Christ O
" O
too O
painful O
" O
. O

Think O
of O
what O
it O
would O
have O
meant O
to O
say O
, O
instead O
, O
" O
a O
little O
painful O
" O

But O
no O
, O
it O
was O
" O

" O
Some O
expressions O

the O

now O
defines O
them O

medieval O

that O
struck O

The O
architect O
Pisoni B-PER

who O

The O
church O
of O
Villazzano B-LOC
was O
inaugurated O
and O
a O
very O
old O
crucifix O
appeared O
inside O
, O
so O
as O
not O
to O
leave O
a O
bare O
wall O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
first O
Christ O

of O
the O

, O
perhaps O
the O
most O
beautiful O
( O

) O
the O
next O
Tuesday O
12 O

at O
11 O

will O
be O

" O
After O
that O
event O
- O
says O
De B-PER
Carli I-PER
- O
everyone O
was O
convinced O
that O
the O
crucifix O
had O
been O
sold O
. O

But O
it O
was O
not O
so O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
however O
, O
I O
had O
transformed O
it O
into O
a O
crucifixion O
: O

a O
house O
around O
it O
, O
an O
altar O
. O

An O
aborted O
idea O
from O
the O
point O
of O

of O
the O
commission O
had O
gone O
ahead O
on O
its O
own O

The O
Christ O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
remained O
the O
same O

" O
He O
has O
, O
however O

been O
found O
a O
home O

At O
his O
feet O
are O
two O
pious O
women O

it O
has O
become O
a O
scene O

" O

What O
will O
happen O
to O
him O
? O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
just O
want O
people O

the O

it O

" O
This O
crucifix O
, O
" O
says O
the O
artist O
, O
" O
has O
somehow O
marked O
some O
consciences O
. O

They O
never O
said O
it O
was O
a O
bad O
work O
. O

Only O
that O
it O
was O
too O
painful O

As O
if O
they O
were O
telling O
a O
bicycle O
racer O
that O
he O
is O

No O
! O

I O
could O
see O
him O
there O

In O

for O
the O

L O

" O

what O
will O

the O

this O

2005 O

And O
on O
the O

as O
at O
school O
, O
no O
one O
escapes O
the O
temptation O
to O
be O
" O
trendy O
" O

We O
meet O
a O
typical O
family O
: O

Dad O
, O
Mom O
and O
a O
beautiful O
little O
girl O
who O
will O
start O

The O
tension O
for O
the O

the O

of O

seems O
not O
to O

The O
backpack O
with O
the O
bear O
most O
beloved O
by O
children O
( O
49.50 O
euros O
) O
is O
blue O
, O
so O
a O
coordinated O
outfit O
is O
urgently O
needed O
: O

Diary O
( O
9.50 O
euros O
) O
and O
pencil O
case O
with O
myriad O
pockets O
and O
zippers O
. O

There O
are O
three O
sizes O
. O

You O
choose O
the O
largest O
( O
23.90 O

There O
would O
be O
a O
separate O
bag O
to O
buy O
too O
, O
but O
the O
one O
in O
the O
same O
shade O
is O
missing O

So O
nothing O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
little O
girl O
runs O
around O
the O
store O
, O
more O
interested O
in O
the O
toys O
than O
in O
the O
" O
merchandise O
" O
she O
will O
have O
to O
take O

In O
short O
, O
a O
total O

82 O

90 O

Without O
notebooks O
, O

, O
the O
inevitable O
covers O
? O

The O
saleswoman O
winks O
and O
says O
: O

" O
If O
you O
come O
earlier O
next O
year O
, O
you O
'll O
have O
more O
choice O

The O

Maybe O

TRENDY O
, O
AT O
ALL O
COSTS O
. O

One O
can O
complain O
that O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
exorbitant O
. O

It O
is O
understandable O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
bitterness O
in O
straining O
the O
wallet O
. O

But O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
always O
prevails O
the O
desire O
to O
buy O
the O
novelty O
. O

Both O
by O
moms O
, O
when O
their O
children O
are O
small O
, O
and O
by O
older O
girls O
who O
shop O
alone O
. O

For O
the O
boys O
the O
discourse O
is O
a O
bit O
different O
, O
since O
they O
are O
often O
inclined O
to O
delegate O
. O

The O
proof O
of O
the O
fashion O
tension O
is O
given O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
proposals O
of O
the O
past O
years O
are O
piled O
sadly O
in O
a O
corner O
, O
under O
the O
word O
" O
offer O
" O
. O

Even O
with O
highly O
competitive O
prices O
, O
the O
backpacks O
of O
the O
" O
old O
" O
cartoon O
characters O
are O
no O
longer O
of O
interest O
. O

And O
so O
The O
Simpsons O
, O
Sabrina O
, O
Arale O
, O
are O
sold O
at O
prices O
ranging O
from O
29 O
to O
39 O
euros O
. O

" O
We O
have O
been O
carrying O

for O
at O

a O
couple O
of O
years O

They O
have O
never O
been O
looked O
at O

because O
they O
are O
out O
of O

This O

About O
sixty O

Particularly O
challenging O
is O
the O

since O

is O
around O
26.90 O

THE O
TIMELESS O

The O
years O
go O
by O

but O
not O
the O
success O
of O
Seven B-ORG
backpacks O

Although O
we O
have O
heard O
them O
called O
" O
Zen O
" O
( O
the O
number O

followed O
by O
the O
final O

. O
Their O
fame O
remains O
constant O
. O

Typically O
, O
the O
basic O
backpack O
is O
around O
64 O
euros O
and O
90 O
. O

Since O
this O
year O
, O
the O
trollies O
seem O
to O
have O
caught O
on O
, O
very O
suitable O
for O
those O
who O
have O
to O
walk O
a O
long O
way O
and O
do O
not O
want O
to O
be O
crushed O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
books O
. O

The O
cost O
is O
in O
line O
with O
that O
of O
a O
normal O
backpack O
. O

After O
a O
period O
of O
decline O
, O
even O
the O
Invicta B-ORG
( O
68 O

seems O
to O
be O
making O
a O

to O
have O

much O
so O
that O

This O
is O
the O
trademark O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
solidarity O
, O
of O
the O
provincial O
funding O
for O

, O
as O
defined O
by O
Councillor O
Iva B-PER
Berasi I-PER
, O
who O
anticipates O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
agreement O
that O
President O

The O
objective O
of O
the O
agreement O
( O
which O
will O
last O
three O
years O
) O
is O
to O
" O
lay O
the O
foundations O
for O
collaboration O
between O
the O
parties O
in O
the O
fields O
of O
education O
and O

, O
professional O
training O
of O

the O
consolidation O
of O

, O
cultural O
and O
social O
" O
, O
as O
stated O
in O
Article O

. O

The O
protocol O
, O
in O

The O
signing O
is O
scheduled O
for O
today O
at O
6 O
p.m. O
and O
it O
is O
the O
last O
testimony O
of O
the O
closeness O
of O

America B-LOC
: O

" O
Our O
interventions O
in O
that O
area O

almost O
exclusively O
dedicated O
to O

Building O
the O
future O
of O

, O
" O

carried O
out O
by O

Perhaps O
Mario B-PER
Bevilacqua I-PER
, O
39 O
years O
old O
, O
native O
of O
Torre B-LOC
Annunziata I-LOC
and O
Anna B-PER

, O
39 O
years O
old O
, O
born O
in O
Verona B-LOC
, O
both O
without O
a O
fixed O
abode O
, O
also O
believed O
that O
the O
40 O
year O
old O
unprepared O
woman O
from O
Trento O
who O
had O
taken O
their O
bait O
would O
never O
, O
ever O
denounce O
them O
. O

In O
this O
, O
however O
, O
they O
were O
wrong O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
the O
provincial B-ORG
operational I-ORG
nucleus I-ORG
of O
the O
Carabinieri B-ORG
commanded O
by O
Lieutenant O
Risottino B-PER
, O
informed O
of O
what O
happened O
, O
went O
back O

' O
identity O
of O
the O
two O

took O
them O
under O

with O
the O
' O
charge O

L O
' O
investigative O
activity O
had O
begun O
in O
the O
spring O
of O
this O
' O
year O
when O
a O
lady O
of O
about O
40 O
years O
of O
Trento B-LOC
, O
won O
the O
shame O
, O
had O
come O
to O
the O
barracks O
to O
report O
the O
theft O
of O
35 O
thousand O
euros O
by O
two O
nomads O
who O
had O
promised O
to O
remove O
the O
evil O
eye O
but O
once O
pocketed O
the O
money O
had O
made O
themselves O
unavailable O
. O

Singular O
the O
way O
in O
which O
Mario B-PER
Bevilacqua I-PER
had O
succeeded O
to O
have O
the O
contact O
with O
the O
woman O
. O

Finding O
himself O
one O
day O
at O
the O
wheel O
of O
his O
car O
and O
traveling O
at O
low O
speed O
, O
the O
lady O
saw O
herself O
being O
overtaken O
by O
a O
Mercedes O
that O
then O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
her O
at O
an O
even O
slower O
speed O
, O
such O
as O
to O
induce O
her O
to O
overtake O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
lady O
- O
who O
had O
also O
performed O
the O
maneuver O
correctly O
- O
heard O
a O
shot O
and O
immediately O
saw O
the O
driver O
of O
the O
Mercedes O
that O
made O
the O
headlights O
. O

She O
stopped O
and O
the O
man O
at O
the O
wheel O
of O
the O
sedan O
pointed O
out O
that O
he O
had O
damaged O
her O
left O
rearview O
mirror O
. O

The O
bewildered O
woman O
- O
although O
her O
car O
showed O
no O
sign O
of O
the O
alleged O
collision O
- O
agreed O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
damage O
estimated O
by O
the O
man O
at O
one O
thousand O
euros O
, O
taking O
the O
money O
to O
her O
home O
with O
the O
nomad O
in O
tow O
. O

It O
was O
while O
talking O
to O
the O
lady O
that O
the O
impostor O
realized O
that O
the O
person O
in O
front O
of O
him O
could O
still O
be O
fooled O
. O

He O
discussed O
with O
her O
about O
the O
evil O
eye O
and O
negative O
influences O
and O
later O
introduced O
her O
to O
Anna B-PER
Abbruzzese I-PER
, O
passed O
off O
as O
a O
magician O
and O
seer O
, O
an O
expert O
- O
as O
chance O
would O
have O
it O
- O
on O
the O
evil O
eye O
. O

The O
forty O
- O
year O
- O
old O
woman O
in O
her O
thirties O
, O
in O
a O
state O
of O
psychic O
weakness O
, O
had O
completely O
lowered O
her O
guard O
and O
met O
five O
times O
with O
the O
" O
sorceress O
" O
, O
who O
for O
the O
" O
rituals O
" O
of O
the O
rituals O
of O
the O
" O

, O
was O

who O
, O
for O
the O
" O
rites O
" O
she O
practiced O
, O
charged O
a O
total O
of O
35 O
thousand O
euros O
. O

When O
the O
lady O
came O
out O
of O
the O
period O
of O
confusion O
suspected O
that O
she O
had O
been O
taken O
for O
a O
ride O
and O
cleaned O
of O
her O
money O
, O
she O
bitterly O
noted O
that O
the O
profiteers O
had O
completely O
disappeared O
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
she O
turned O
to O
the O
Carabinieri B-ORG

Their O
work O
was O
not O
at O
all O
easy O
, O
but O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
long O
investigation O

managed O

The O
mayors O
of O

can O
not O
decide O
, O
with O

, O
to O
fine O

This O
is O
emphasized O
by O
the O
Supreme O
Court B-ORG
warning O
the O
" O
first O

" O
that O
if O
they O
want O
to O
prevent O
drivers O
from O
creating O
obstacles O
to O
municipal O
traffic O
, O
then O
they O
must O
place O
road O
signs O
prohibiting O
the O
stop O
or O
parking O
along O
the O
avenues O
of O
sex O

In O
essence O
, O
mayors O
can O
not O
use O
the O
prescriptions O
of O
the O

prohibit O
the O

to O
pursue O
purposes O
inherent O
in O
" O
the O
protection O
of O
morals O

decency O
. O

And O
they O
can O
not O
even O
claim O
to O
have O
prepared O
the O
ordinances O
anti O

firefly O
because O
it O
lacks O
" O
a O
signal O
typified O
in O
the O

of O
the O
road O
" O
that O
is O
placed O
to O
safeguard O
" O
the O
protection O
of O
morals O
and O
public O
decency O
. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
the O
Supreme O
Court B-ORG
tells O
city O
administrators O
that O
it O
is O
sufficient O
to O
use O
a O
normal O
signal O
of O
" O
no O
parking O
" O
and O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
mayors O
" O
invent O
signals O
not O
typified O
" O
. O

In O
the O
wake O
of O
these O
principles O
, O
the O
Court O
of O
Cassation B-ORG
rejected O
the O

presented O
by O

Paolo B-PER
Cunego I-PER
of O
the O
Consumer B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
has O
it O
in O
for O
the O
authorities O
who O
have O
decided O
to O
review O
the O
level O
of O
tariffs O
, O
but O
also O
with O
the O
union O
. O

" O
In O
June O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
increase O
certain O
tariffs O
, O
which O
have O
been O
stagnant O
for O
some O
time O
. O

But O
we O
had O
been O
told O
that O
basically O
the O
bus O
fares O
in O
Trento B-LOC
would O
have O
increased O
. O

Instead O
, O
passes O
for O
transport O
and O
the O
same O
train O
ticket O
have O
increased O
. O

Increases O
, O
on O
transport O
, O
of O
10 O
% O
12 O
% O
. O

In O
recent O
days O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
the O
Adoc B-ORG
that O
refers O
to O
the O
Uil B-ORG
, O
let O
us O
know O
that O
the O
costs O
of O
school O
supplies O
are O
rising O
. O

But O
that O
union O
, O
along O
with O
others O
, O
had O
meanwhile O
accepted O
the O
increase O
in O
rates O
. O

Excuse O
me O
, O
Cunego B-PER
, O
but O
the O
level O
of O
the O
tariffs O
was O
still O
in O
2000 O
. O

" O
True O
, O
but O
inflation O
in O
the O
meantime O
has O
not O
been O
the O
same O
as O
that O
set O
by O
various O
governments O
, O
and O
wages O
have O
been O
eroded O
. O

And O
there O
is O
more O
: O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
many O
public O
or O
parapublic O
services O
have O
deteriorated O
. O

Think O
of O
the O
railways O
. O

On O
certain O
routes O
, O
or O
even O
at O
certain O
times O
of O
the O
year O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
or O
stand O
. O

Think O
of O
the O
train O
that O
arrives O
in O
Trento B-LOC
during O
the O
Christmas O
Market O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
I O
say O
that O
the O
service O
is O
no O
longer O
adequate O
to O
the O
fare O
. O

The O
union O
, O
then O
, O
if O
it O
accepts O
the O
increase O
in O
fares O
, O
must O
demand O
an O
improvement O
in O
the O
service O
. O

Paolo B-PER
Cunego I-PER
also O
observes O
that O
in O
this O
way O
the O
use O
of O
public O
transportation O
is O
disincentivized O
, O
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
private O
transportation O
. O

But O
the O
train O
is O
a O
national O
fact O
, O
we O
observe O
. O

" O
Even O
the O
Valsugana O
railway O
is O
not O
offering O
a O
valuable O
service O

" O
because O
our O

four O

To O
have O
maintained O
this O
base O
is O
important O
. O

Over O
a O
broader O
period O
, O
our O
trend O
is O
quite O
stable O
. O

We O
must O
n't O
forget O
that O
last O
year O
economics B-ORG
showed O
a O
strong O
increase O
and O
that O
we O
are O
facing O
strong O
competition O
. O

In O
perspective O
we O
must O
explain O
to O
young O
people O
that O
our O
faculty B-ORG
does O
not O
prepare O
technicians O

but O
managers O
capable O
of O

And O
then O

expect O
a O

at O

Roberto B-PER

president O
of O
the O

- O
our O
associate O
Marino B-PER
Sighel I-PER
shot O
a O
male O
deer O

And O
he O
realized O
that O
he O
had O
a O
strange O
yellow O
ring O
in O
his O
ear O
, O
with O
the O
number O
6 O
printed O

Today O
I O
receive O
a O
communication O
from O
the O
Federation B-ORG
of I-ORG
Hunters I-ORG
. O

I O
have O
been O
denounced O
as O
president O
because O
a O
person O
claims O
the O
beast O
. O

Would O
you O
like O
to O
explain O
? O

" O
The O
complaint O
was O
made O
by O
Marino B-PER
Paoli I-PER
, O
from O
Civezzano B-LOC
. O

He O
asserts O
that O
the O
deer O
was O
his O
, O
that O
he O
raised O
it O
in O
his O
lands O
and O
that O
therefore O
it O
should O
not O
have O
been O
shot O
. O

But O
we O
inquired O
and O
that O
beast O
had O
escaped O
and O
had O
been O
wandering O
the O
woods O
for O
months O
. O

Free O
. O

It O
had O
, O
in O
short O
, O
gone O
wild O
. O

And O
how O
could O
our O
hunter O
know O
that O
a O
deer O
that O
passed O
in O
front O
of O
him O
was O
actually O
private O
property O
? O

" O
. O

If O
at O
first O
Roberto B-PER
Ioriatti I-PER
was O
a O
little O
frightened O
, O
then O
he O
became O
a O
little O
bit O
angry O
. O

And O
like O
a O
good O
pinaitro O
, O
he O
took O
action O
. O

He O
immediately O
communicated O
with O
the O
Federcaccia B-ORG
headquarters O
in O
Trento B-LOC
, O
then O
with O
certain O
lawyers O
in O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

To O
get O
a O
complaint O
, O
even O
if O
not O
criminal O
, O
without O
having O
done O
anything O
was O
already O
strange O
. O

But O
to O
pass O
for O
a O
fool O
was O
not O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

The O
deer O
was O
killed O
in O
Costalta B-LOC
, O
" O
he O
says O
in O
one O
breath O
, O
" O
12 O
kilometers O
from O
S. B-LOC
Agnese I-LOC
di I-LOC
Civezzano I-LOC
where O
that O
gentleman O
raised O
the O
animal O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
we O
were O
told O
that O
when O
a O
domestic O
animal O
escapes O
and O
returns O
to O
the O
natural O
cycle O
, O
it O
becomes O
part O
of O
the O
public O
fauna O
. O

So O
, O
in O
our O
case O
, O
it O
was O
huntable O
. O

What O
did O
they O
tell O
you O
to O
do O
at O
the O
Federation B-ORG
? O

" O
They O
reassured O
me O
, O
they O
begged O
me O
not O
to O
move O
. O

That O
things O
will O
clear O
up O
soon O
and O
we O
have O
nothing O
to O
fear O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
unfortunate O
deer O
has O
already O
been O
quartered O
and O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
freezer O
of O
the O
hunter O
who O
shot O
it O
down O
. O

" O
Certainly O
- O
adds O
Ioriatti B-PER
- O
our O
partner O
will O
not O
return O
what O
is O
legitimately O
his O
. O

From O
the O
information O
we O
have O
taken O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
animal O
had O
already O
escaped O
around O
May O
or O
June O
from O
the O
place O
where O
it O
lived O
in O
captivity O
. O

Right O
therefore O
to O
listen O
also O
to O
the O
other O
bell O

And O
that O
is O
Marino B-PER

who O
in O
the O

Civezzano B-LOC
is O
a O
quarryman O

" O
That O
beast O
was O
mine O
and O
it O
was O
recognizable O
. O
- O
The O
deer O
had O
escaped O
on O
May O
6th O
. O

And O
I O
immediately O
reported O
it O
to O

Pergine B-LOC
Forestry O

I O
had O
two O

a O

And O
what O
did O
he O
do O
with O
them O
? O

Raising O
deer O
is O
certainly O
not O
a O
very O
common O
activity O

after O

the O

had O
made O
an O
inspection O
at O
my O

So O
, O
having O
reported O
the O
thing O
, O
you O
can O
certainly O
not O
say O
that O
no O
one O
knew O
anything O
about O
the O
escape O

Then O
, O
the O
beast O
had O
at O
his O
ear O
, O
clearly O
visible O
, O
the O
yellow O

That O
's O
why O
I O
reported O

now O
I O

these O

Condini B-PER

In O
light O
of O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
councillor O
Andreatta B-PER
to O
take O
into O
consideration O
the O
requests O
presented O
by O
June O

of O
this O
year O
, O
the O
Vela B-LOC
demand O
that O
their O
requests O
be O
discussed O
in O
committee O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
this O
round O
of O
revision O
of O
the O
Prg O
there O
will O
be O
no O
discussion O
of O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
scrapyard O
, O
so O
the O
Vela B-LOC
, O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
does O
not O
run O
any O
risks O
. O

Residents O
, O
however O
, O
return O
to O
the O
charge O
to O
protect O
themselves O
for O

, O
in O

that O
, O
some O
subsequent O
urban O
passage O
( O
perhaps O
within O

review O
for O
public O
works O
) O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
change O
the O
destination O
of O
those O
lands O
. O

In O
recent O
days O
Condini B-PER
has O
therefore O
written O
to O
President O
Agostino B-PER
Bitteleri I-PER
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
case O
of O
Vela B-LOC
is O
adequately O
discussed O
within O

planning B-ORG
commission I-ORG
. O

" O
On O
behalf O
of O
the O
committee O
- O
he O
insists O
- O
I O
ask O
that O
our O
questions O
are O
at O
least O
examined O
, O
hoping O
for O
a O
favorable O
outcome O
. O

Condini B-PER
says O
he O
has O
already O
received O
the O
support O
of O
Pompermaier B-PER
and O
Pattini B-PER
, O
members O
of O
the O
commission B-ORG
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
up O
to O
the O
administration O
to O
take O
over O
the O
game O
by O
responding O
to O
the O
requests O
of O
the O
community O
. O

We O
believe O
it O
is O
opportune O
, O
" O
write O
the O
applicants O
in O
the O
request O
for O
a O
variant O
to O
the O
Prg O
sent O
to O
Mayor O
Pacher B-PER
, O
" O
that O
the O
entire O
green O
area O
north O
of O
Vela B-LOC
( O
Laghetti B-LOC
) O
should O
be O
transformed O
into O
a O
park O
, O
a O
nature O
reserve O
for O
the O
entire O
city O
, O
due O
to O
its O
high O
and O
original O
landscape O
and O
environmental O
value O
. O

As O
an O
alternative O
, O
they O
propose O
the O
maintenance O
of O
the O
current O
destination O
to O
primary O
agricultural O
green O
( O
as O
provided O
by O
the O
Pup O
) O
and O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
buffer O
zone O
of O
at O
least O
150 O
meters O
from O
the O
bordering O
biotopes O
, O
from O
the O
ponds O
of O
Velaverde O
and O
Sorasass B-LOC
, O
and O
as O
many O
from O
the O
Adige B-LOC
River O
. O

" O
Within O
this O
buffer O
zone O
- O
here O
is O
the O
most O
important O
step O
- O
should O
not O
be O
exercised O
production O
activities O
incompatible O
with O
the O
neighboring O
biotopes O
and O
even O
built O
buildings O
or O
infrastructure O
not O
directly O
related O
to O
the O
biotopes O
and O
agriculture O
. O

" O
We O
think O
- O
they O
conclude O
- O
that O
the O
protection O
of O
this O
area O
is O
of O
great O
interest O
to O
all O
current O
inhabitants O
of O
Trentino B-LOC

for O
future O
generations O

agree O

almost O
everything O

on O
one O
thing O
in O

In O
praising O
the O

that O

met O
him O
in O

Yesterday O
, O
with O
a O
significant O
choice O
, O
Fischer B-PER
made O
one O
of O
his O
first O
visits O
abroad O
to O
Rome B-LOC

Ciampi B-PER
appreciated O
the O
gesture O
and O
announced O
that O
he O
would O
soon O
reciprocate O
the O
courtesy O
by O
going O
to O
Vienna B-LOC

Many O
political O
questions O
and O
initiatives O

the O

field O
were O
discussed O
during O
yesterday O

during O
the O
lunch O
at O
the O
Quirinale O
. O

But O
the O
issue O
of O
border O

seems O
to O
have O
had O
a O
special O
attention O
. O

In O
recent O
weeks O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
proposals O
for O

had O
caused O
some O
apprehension O
in O
Vienna B-LOC

and O
also O
in O

and O
Bolzano B-LOC
, O
which O
, O
among O

, O
Benita B-PER

could O
" O
considerably O
limit O
the O
legislative O
autonomy O
" O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC

Concerns O
that O
were O
shared O
in O
Vienna B-LOC

where O
Fischer B-PER
, O
after O
listening O
to O
Durnwalder B-PER
, O
assured O
him O

Because O

there O
are O

the O

an O

they O

" O

Confesercenti B-ORG

hastened O
to O
say O
. O

But O
for O
now O
the O
license O
is O
a O
right O
. O

On O
the O
news O
of O
discontent O
in O
Via B-LOC
Pozzo I-LOC
was O
then O
triggered O
a O
fight O
and O
response O
with O
the O
consumer B-ORG
protection I-ORG
committee I-ORG
, O
which O
had O
welcomed O
the O
new O
arrival O
and O
denounced O
the O
' O
existence O
of O
a O
cartel O
between O
bartenders O
to O
keep O
prices O
high O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
after O
the O
controversy O
, O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
premises O
, O
who O
had O
already O
promised O
Dersut B-ORG
that O
he O
would O
rent O
it O
out O
, O
backed O
out O
, O
evidently O
frightened O
by O
the O
fuss O
or O
convinced O
by O
the O
pressure O
of O
the O
neighbors O
. O

And O
in O
place O
of O
the O
new O
bar O
, O
he O
recently O
opened O
an O
employment O
agency O
, O
welcomed O
with O
a O
sigh O
of O
relief O
by O
the O
neighboring O
shopkeepers O
. O

So O
everything O
is O
solved O
? O

Not O
by O
a O
long O
shot O
. O

Initially O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
Dersut B-ORG
had O
thought O
of O
abandoning O
the O

in O
Trento B-LOC

But O
then O
another O
free O

popped O
up O
, O
just O
a O
few O
steps O
from O
the O
previous O
one O
, O
and O
so O
on O
with O
a O
new O
request O
for O
a O

for O
a O

The O

if O
the O

which O
in O

to O
the O

the O
parent O

will O
focus O
on O
the O
sale O
of O

The O

part O

a O
chain O

A O
modality O
that O

This O
is O
exactly O
what O
the O

change O

This O
concept O
was O
echoed O
by O

who O
, O
without O

Presented O
the O
project O
that O
will O
change O
the O
face O
of O
the O

Gardolo B-LOC
: O

Via O
S. O
Anna O

be O
changed O
Less O

, O
more O

The O
announcement O
has O
been O
awaited O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
certain O
: O

Via O
S. O
Anna O
, O
in O
Gardolo B-LOC
, O
within O
a O
year O
will O
return O
to O
the O
road O
that O
was O
so O
dear O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Gardolo O
in O
the O
past O
, O
without O
those O
dangerous O
points O
and O
traffic O
that O
today O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
characterize O
it O
. O

In O
a O
meeting O
with O
the O
population O
, O
the O
engineer O
Bruno B-PER
Delaiti I-PER
( O
road B-ORG
service I-ORG
of O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
) O
presented O
the O
executive O
project O
of O
the O
new O
road O
, O
which O
should O
be O
completed O
, O
if O
all O
goes O
well O
, O
within O
2005 O
. O

Undoubtedly O
of O
modern O
conception O
, O
the O
new O
elaborate O
introduces O
, O
in O
the O
street O
that O
starts O
from O
Piazza O
Libert√† O
, O
numerous O
innovations O
. O

The O
first O
, O
and O
perhaps O
the O
most O
important O
, O
is O
the O
narrowing O
of O
the O
roadway O
, O
which O
will O
have O
an O
average O
width O
of O
6.5 O
meters O
. O

This O
, O
in O
the O
intentions O
of O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
, O
should O
largely O
inhibit O
the O
' O
use O
of O
the O
road O
by O
commuters O
who O
today O
by O
- O
pass O
so O
the O
busy O
Via O
Bolzano O
. O

The O
traffic O
jams O
on O
via O
Bolzano O
, O
however O
, O
are O
destined O
to O
disappear O
in O
the O
future O
, O
since O
the O
large O
traffic O
circle O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
Bermax B-ORG
store O
is O
on O
the O
launching O
pad O
. O

But O
the O
new O
via O
S. O
Anna O
will O
also O
be O
equipped O
with O
a O
bicycle O
lane O
, O
which O
will O
be O
realized O
on O
the O
east O
side O
of O
the O
street O
together O
with O
a O
renewed O
and O
widened O
sidewalk O
. O

The O
designers O
have O
taken O
care O
of O
every O
aspect O
: O

In O
order O
to O
make O
room O
for O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
, O
the O
current O
acacia O
saplings O
will O
be O
removed O
, O
but O
in O
their O
place O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
a O
new O
tree O
will O
be O
planted O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
previous O
one O
, O
coupled O
with O
small O
hedges O
and O
floral O
species O
. O

Among O
the O
other O
design O
choices O
, O
stands O
out O
the O
creation O
of O
some O
small O
bays O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
road O
, O
which O
will O
also O
allow O
the O
birth O
of O
27 O
new O
parking O
spaces O
that O
, O
in O
the O
intentions O
of O
the O
district B-LOC
, O
will O
be O
regulated O
, O
at O

during O
daylight O

with O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O

( O
it O
is O

Two O
new O

will O
also O
make O
their O

they O
will O
be O
permanent O
, O
obtained O
by O

In O
the O

the O

If O

Andrea B-PER
Pugliese I-PER
, O

rejects O
the O

put O

by O

Professor O
Pugliese B-PER
, O
what O
does O
n't O
convince O
you O
about O
the O
proposals O
made O
by O
Councilor O
Gilmozzi B-PER
? O

They O
are O
useful O
measures O
, O
like O
those O
put O
in O
place O
last O
year O
, O
but O
they O
are O
insufficient O
. O

The O
effects O
have O
not O
been O
seen O
. O

It O
is O
not O
enough O
, O
in O
short O
, O
to O
block O
a O
few O
diesels O
to O
hope O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
of O
particulate O
matter O
. O

Your O
opinion O
: O

Is O
it O
better O
to O
institute O
a O
system O
of O
blocking O
alternating O
plates O
? O

I O
think O
I O
can O
say O
that O
that O
solution O
brought O
greater O
benefits O
. O

If O
nothing O
else O
, O
it O
offered O
a O
stronger O
message O
to O
citizens O
because O
everyone O
was O
involved O
in O
some O
way O
. O

Today O
it O
is O
different O
: O

The O
measure O
affects O
only O
a O
few O
vehicles O
and O
95 O
percent O
of O
the O
citizens O
of O
Trentino O
have O
lost O
interest O
in O
following O
the O
matter O
. O

How O
do O
you O
judge O
the O
relationship O
of O
the O
Trentino O
people O
with O
the O
problem O
of O
air O
pollution O
? O

Do O
they O
inform O
themselves O
? O

Are O
they O
sensitive O
? O

I O
would O
say O
yes O
. O

If O
anything O
, O
the O
problem O
is O
the O
difficulty O
of O
moving O
from O
theory O
to O
practice O
when O
the O
measures O
affect O
them O
personally O
. O

Just O
to O
give O
you O
an O
example O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
gasoline O
consumption O
has O
dropped O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
keep O
talking O
about O
traffic O
as O
the O
main O
cause O
of O
fine O
dust O
. O

If O
you O
were O
a O
consultant O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
what O
indications O
would O
you O
give O
to O
the O
Councillor O
? O

One O
thing O
is O
the O
emergency O
, O
another O
is O
the O
structural O
plan O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
first O
aspect O
is O
concerned O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
little O
is O
being O
done O
. O

I O
repeat O
, O
I O
am O
in O
favor O
of O
alternate O
plates O
, O
of O
total O
blocks O
of O
traffic O
, O
maybe O
even O
on O
scheduled O
days O
. O

What O
about O
structural O
interventions O
? O

In O
words O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
what O
the O
Province B-LOC
says O
: O

Alternative O
mobility O
, O
strengthening O
of O
public O
transport O
, O
use O
of O
bicycles O
. O

The O
trouble O
is O
that O
we O
talk O
a O
lot O
, O
we O
write O
a O
lot O
, O
but O
everything O
moves O
very O
slowly O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
this O
blessed O
public O
transport O
service O
should O
actually O
be O
made O
adequate O
. O

In O
Trento B-LOC
the O
situation O
is O
good O
, O
but O
there O
is O
much O
to O
improve O
in O
the O
suburban O
area O
. O

For O
example O
? O

The O
Valsugana O
subway O
. O

We O
've O
been O
talking O
about O
it O
for O
years O
, O
but O
when O
will O
we O
actually O
be O
able O
to O
use O
it O
? O

This O
is O
a O
direct O
criticism O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

They O
produce O
so O
many O
documents O
, O
but O
in O
reality O
they O
make O
large O
investments O
only O
for O
tunnels O
, O
bridges O
and O
roads O
. O

In O
short O
, O
to O
favor O
private O
traffic O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
the O
proposal O
of O
the O
city O
councilor O
Giampaolo B-PER
Berlanda I-PER
to O
allow O
access O
to O
the O
city O
only O
by O
payment O
, O
financing O
the O
free O
buses O
with O
the O
revenues O
? O

In O
principle O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

But O
then O
there O
is O
the O
problem O
of O
translating O
it O
into O
reality O
. O

Last O
year O
, O
Legambiente B-ORG
organized O
the O
green O
train O
to O
raise O
awareness O
of O
environmental O
issues O
, O
stopping O
for O
a O
few O

in O
Trento B-LOC
. O

Are O
you O
planning O
any O
other O
initiatives O
this O
year O
? O

This O
year O
the O
green O

will O
take O
other O

we O
wo O
n't O

sitting O

that O
the O
problem O

" O
But O
we O
are O
less O

in O

For O
the O
type O
of O
our O
stores O

in O
the O

are O
often O
small O

According O
to O
the O
official O

many O
categories O

steal O
: O

From O
the O

the O

Have O
you O

" O
We O
have O
a O
generic O
item O

It O
is O
around O
0,5 O

we O

And O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
with O
this O
system O

we O
have O
also O
found O
that O
the O

caught O

a O
very O
good O

Abi B-ORG

that O

therefore O
we O
invite O
all O

It O
is O
enough O
to O

that O

And O
the O
answer O
came O
from O
the O
beautiful O

that O

A O
little O
bit O
everyone O
wondered O
instead O
what O
the O
real O
political O
situation O
was O
, O
after O
the O

from O

" O

" O
; O

The O
answer O
came O
from O
a O
Chisinau B-LOC
that O
was O
very O
different O
from O
the O
one O
found O
in O
' O
96 O
by O
Sacchi B-PER

Under B-ORG
and O
Italy O
, O
and O
then O
from O
the O
relaxed O
smiles O
of O
the O
young O
people O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
the O
center O
and O
around O
the O

Where O
the O

device O
was O
all O
in O
a O

car O
and O
two O
agents O
of O
the O
internal O

. O

Much O
less O
than O
the O
paratroopers O
in O
camouflage O
and O
holding O
machine O
guns O
who O
were O
stationed O
a O
hundred O
meters O
away O
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
headquarters O
or O
the O
German O
embassy O
. O

" O
Chisinau B-LOC
is O
very O
different O
from O
what O
it O
was O
seven O
years O
ago O
, O
a O
less O
sad O
and O
more O
serene O
city O
, O
" O
says O
Claudio B-PER
Culini I-PER
, O
a O
companion O
of O
the O
Under B-ORG
. O

The O
echo O
of O
the O
tensions O
with O
Tiraspol B-LOC
is O
far O
away O
, O
so O
hidden O
are O
the O
implications O
of O
the O
difficult O
economic O
situation O
: O

80 O
% O
of O
the O
population O
is O
below O
the O
poverty O
line O
, O
inflation O
is O
around O
11.7 O
% O
, O
and O
Moldova B-LOC
remains O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
European O
train O
. O

Last O
August O
, O
political O
tensions O
were O
also O
very O
high O
. O

The O
Russian O
population O
of O
the O
autonomous O
region O
of O
Transnistria B-LOC
( O
13 O
% O
of O
a O
total O
of O
five O
million O
, O
64 O
% O
Romanians O
) O
had O
opposed O
the O
opening O
of O
a O
Romanian O
- O
language O
elementary O
school O
. O

The O
war O
between O
the O
two O
ethnic O
groups O
in O
' O
94 O
caused O
thousands O
of O
deaths O
, O
and O
when O
last O
summer O
parents O
and O
children O
waiting O
in O
line O
for O
enrollment O
were O
forcibly O
taken O
away O
by O
the O
dominant O
ethnic O
group O
in O
Tiraspol B-LOC
, O
the O
ghosts O
of O
the O
past O
reappeared O
in O
the O
distance O
. O

So O
, O
although O
the O
situation O
had O
calmed O
down O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
government O
in O
Chisinau B-LOC
decided O
last O
Friday O
to O
cancel O
the O
Tiraspol B-LOC
seat O
, O
with O
a O
striking O
coincidence O
with O
the O
Baslan B-LOC
tragedy O
. O

Inevitably O
, O
despite O
the O
thousands O
of O
kilometers O
from O
the O
hell O
of O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
, O
the O
Italian O
group O
was O
anxious O
about O
the O
approach O
to O
Chisinau B-LOC
. O

Then O
, O
the O
direct O
contact O
dispelled O
doubts O
and O
fears O
. O

To O
bring O
everyone O
back O
down O
to O
earth O
, O
for O
a O
simple O
soccer O
match O
, O
the O
usual O
welcome O
of O
local O
fans O
with O
Totti B-PER
, O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
, O
AC O
Milan B-ORG
or O
even O
the O
old O
CCCP B-ORG

. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
however O
, O
it O
remained O
to O
define O
the O
complicated O
program O
. O

With O
the O
possibility O
of O
using O
the O
Dinamo B-ORG
field O
having O
vanished O
completely O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
left O
was O
the O
" O

two O
training O

in O

yesterday O
( O

the O

Fortunately O
, O
the O
clouds O
did O
not O
dump O

on O
the O
field O
already O
put O
to O
the O
test O
. O

But O
until O
the O
last O
minute O
, O
Uefa B-ORG
will O
keep O
everyone O
in O
suspense O
. O

The O
Tiraspol B-LOC

been O

its O

( O

the O

In O

the O

instead O
worked O
in O
a O

outside O
the O
Uefa B-ORG

, O
like O

they O
will O
keep O
a O
good O

Maybe O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
, O
but O
nobody O
doubts O
that O

To O

if O

had O
also O
asked O
for O
the O
condemnation O
of O
Tarasconi B-PER

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
motivations O
of O
the O
sentence O
in O
order O
to O
understand O
what O
reasoning O
led O
the O
judge O
to O
inflict O
a O
sentence O
, O
however O
minimal O
. O

The O
defenders O
of O
Lorenz B-PER
, O
Roberto B-PER
Bertuol I-PER
and O
Alberto B-PER
Cunaccia I-PER
, O
had O
valid O
arguments O
for O
hoping O
for O
an O
acquittal O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
there O
was O
an O
appraisal O
entrusted O
by O
the O
judge O
to O
Commander O
Calabresi B-PER
( O
a O
doyen O
of O
flying O
) O
that O
excluded O
responsibility O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
organizers O
. O

According O
to O
the O
defense O
lacked O
the O
causal O
link O
since O
the O
death O
would O
be O
attributed O
to O
a O
reckless O
conduct O
of O
the O
race O
by O
the O
same O
Tiberio B-PER
Riva I-PER
. O

In O
favor O
of O
the O
defense O
also O
played O
a O
second O
circumstance O
: O

at O
any O
time O
the O
competitors O
could O
have O
interrupted O
the O
race O
and O
landed O
in O
areas O
specifically O
identified O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
judge O
felt O
that O
Lorenz B-PER
was O
responsible O
, O
or O
perhaps O
co O
- O
responsible O
, O
and O
only O
on O
his O
part O
. O

Ancona B-PER
probably O
believed O
that O
the O
defendant O
had O
the O
tools O
to O
understand O
that O
when O
Riva B-PER
was O
preparing O
for O
his O
flight O
, O
the O
weather O
conditions O
were O
no O
longer O
safe O
and O
therefore O
he O
should O
have O
suspended O
the O
departures O
. O

Instead O
, O
Riva B-PER
, O
35 O
years O
old O
from O
Bergamo B-LOC
, O
had O
taken O
off O
from O
Belvedere B-LOC
di O
Canazei B-LOC
and O
should O
have O
landed O
at O
the O
end O
of O
his O
evolutions O
in O
the O
plain O
of O
Campitello B-LOC
. O

After O
about O
ten O
minutes O
in O
the O

, O
however O
, O
his O

touched O
the O

here O

" O
To O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O

the O

which O
we O
are O
fortunately O
able O

us O

it O

a O
bit O

even O
if O
we O

When O
you O

the O

That O
the O

" O
Sure O
, O
even O
if O
I O
tend O
to O
distinguish O
the O
two O
moments O
of O
a O
society O
and O
often O
the O
management O
of O
the O

is O
more O
complicated O

it O

" O
Since O

let O
's O
do O
it O
first O
. O

Yes O
, O
since O
always O
. O

Since O
when O
, O
little O
more O
than O
teenagers O
, O
we O
thought O
that O
tennis O
could O
become O
our O
life O
or O
, O
at O
least O
, O
a O
very O
important O
part O
of O
it O
. O

Valerio B-PER
Mosele I-PER
succeeded O
, O
we O
did O
not O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
was O
Valerio B-PER
himself O
, O
that O
small O
and O
skinny O
child O
with O
a O
jaunty O
wisp O
over O
his O
smart O
eyes O
, O
always O
on O
the O
move O
, O
who O
put O
us O
, O
perhaps O
unconsciously O
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
watershed O
, O
one O
of O
the O
many O
that O
life O
proposes O
: O

here O
remained O
all O
those O
who O
played O
, O
even O
well O
, O
but O
as O
a O
hobby O
, O
there O
passed O
only O
those O
few O
who O
had O
accepted O
the O
sacrifices O
and O
renunciations O
to O
be O
able O
to O
become O
players O
for O
a O
living O
. O

And O
the O
passage O
was O
not O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
skill O
, O
but O
also O
of O
head O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
Valerio B-PER
, O
however O
, O
it O
has O
long O
been O
a O
matter O
of O
skill O
. O

It O
's O
only O
because O
we O
were O
friends O
that O
we O
did O
n't O
tell O
him O
to O
go O
to O
hell O
when O
, O
maybe O
without O
attacking O
a O
shot O
, O
he O
would O
beat O
us O
with O
a O
hail O
of O
shots O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
court O
. O

You O
could O
throw O
it O
at O
him O
in O
all O
angles O
, O
on O
the O
forehand O
and O
backhand O
, O
but O
he O
always O
took O
it O
and O
sent O
it O
back O
there O
long O
, O
worked O
and O
poisonously O
deep O
. O

A O
fine O
arm O
, O
especially O
on O
the O
backhand O
, O
damn O
him O
. O

And O
now O
, O
three O
- O
four O
tennis O
eras O
later O
, O
we O
found O
him O
in O
front O
of O
us O
again O
, O
on O
a O
warm O
autumn O
day O
, O
in O
the O
gazebo O
of O
" O
his O
" O
club O
, O
in O
Riva B-LOC
, O
talking O
about O
the O
tennis O
that O
was O
but O
also O
of O
that O
which O
will O
be O
. O

We O
found O
ourselves O
changed O
, O
but O
not O
that O
much O
, O
or O
at O
least O
not O
inside O
. O

He O
is O
a O
little O
more O
voluminous O
, O
but O
he O
has O
the O
relaxed O
face O
of O
men O
who O
are O
at O
peace O
with O
their O
conscience O
and O
above O
all O
are O
doing O
a O
job O
they O
love O
. O

Yes O
, O
because O
he O
, O
who O
graduated O
as O
a O
teacher O
back O
in O
' O
68 O
, O
still O
manages O
not O
to O
be O
an O
automaton O
that O
grinds O
backhanders O
and O
rights O
and O
dispenses O
token O
suggestions O
, O
but O
he O
is O
passionate O
, O
he O
lives O
the O
lesson O
, O
every O
lesson O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
the O
first O
of O
his O
career O
. O

We O
do O
not O
know O
if O
he O
is O
the O
dean O
of O
the O
masters O
of O
the O
region B-LOC
, O
it O
is O
certain O
, O
however O
, O
that O
he O
has O
a O
record O
: O

He O
has O
been O
teaching O
for O
thirty O
years O
in O
the O
same O
club O
- O
Ct O
Riva O
- O
, O
a O
fact O
that O
is O
absolutely O
in O
contrast O
with O
what O
happens O
in O
almost O
all O
other O
realities O
, O
where O
the O
turn O
- O
over O
has O
become O
almost O
a O
rule O
. O

A O
beautiful O
record O
that O
, O
however O
, O
imposes O
a O
question O
obvious O
. O

How O
many O
toads O
, O
in O
thirty O
years O
, O
have O
you O
had O
to O
swallow O
, O
Valerio B-PER
? O

" O
Many O
, O
but O
all O
digestible O
. O

In O
the O
sense O
that O
they O
served O
me O
to O
grow O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
grow O
, O
if O
you O
metabolize O
them O
well O
, O
you O
need O
also O
the O
mistakes O
. O

How O
many O
presidents O
have O
you O
changed O
? O

" O
A O
difficult O
count O
, O
let O
's O
say O
about O
ten O
. O

And O
did O
you O
get O
along O
with O
everyone O
? O

" O
Yes O
, O
there O
have O
never O
been O
big O
problems O
. O

But O
do O
you O
realize O
that O
, O
compared O
to O
other O
colleagues O
of O
yours O
, O
you O
are O
a O
white O
fly O
? O

" O
Yes O
, O
it O
is O
not O
often O
that O
a O
teacher O
stays O
so O
long O
in O
the O
same O
club O
, O
but O
I O
have O
been O
favored O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
see O
Riva B-LOC
as O
the O
only O
town O
where O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
live O
, O
even O
if O
I O
lived O
in O
Rome B-LOC

Trento B-LOC
, O
and O
I O
consider O
this O
my O
club O
and O
not O
the O
club O
where O
I O
work O
. O

It O
is O
significant O
that O
I O
have O
the O
membership O
card O
n O
¬∞ O
229 O
. O

And O
then O
I O
get O
attached O
to O
the O
kids O
who O
come O
to O
school O
and O
I O
would O
always O
like O
to O
follow O
them O

never O

of O
them O

His O
new O
home O
, O
in O
Riva B-LOC
, O
was O
close O
to O
the O
Casina O
delle O
Magnolie O
- O
temple O
of O
tennis O
in O
Benaco O
at O
that O
time O
, O
which O
boasted O
excellent O
players O
such O
as O
Alberti B-PER
, O
Oradini B-PER
, O
Dallago B-PER
, O
Malossini B-PER
- O
and O
perhaps O
it O
was O
for O
that O
reason O
that O
he O
chose O
the O
sport O
of O
tennis O
. O

His O
first O
teacher O
was O
a O
certain O
Masprone B-PER
, O
a O
Milanese O
transplanted O
on O
Lake O
Garda B-LOC
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
I O
began O
with O
him O
, O
but O
then O
many O
masters O
contributed O
to O
my O
training O
: O

Max B-PER
Malossini I-PER
, O
Chiericatti B-PER
, O
a O
native O
of O
Rio O
transplanted O
in O
Peru B-LOC
( O
he O
was O
the O
discoverer O
of O
the O
great O
Alex B-PER
Olmedo I-PER
, O
ndr O
) O
, O
Mario B-PER
Comperini I-PER
. O

But O
the O
engineer O
Dallago B-PER
helped O
me O
a O
lot O
, O
he O
was O
a O
very O
good O
player O
, O
but O
above O
all O
he O
paid O
attention O
to O
the O
youth O
activity O
. O

Then O
, O
when O
I O
was O
fifteen O
, O
I O
went O
to O
Ct O
Rovereto O
, O
where O
I O
found O
in O
Pipetto B-PER
Ferrari I-PER
a O
great O
president O
and O
above O
all O
a O
friend O
: O

He O
took O
me O
around O
to O
make O
tournaments O
, O
he O
pampered O
me O
, O
almost O
a O
father O
for O
me O
. O

At O
youth O
level O
, O
Valerio B-PER
won O
everything O
and O
then O
grew O
up O
again O
touching O
, O
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
competitive O
career O
, O
the O
ranking O
of O
+ O
2 O
/ O
6 O
of O
second B-ORG
category I-ORG
. O

An O
abstruse O
thing O
for O
who O
is O
young O
or O
follows O
tennis O
since O
a O
short O
time O
, O
to O
what O
could O
be O
related O
in O
the O
current O
rankings O
? O

" O
It O
is O
difficult O
to O
make O
a O
comparison O
. O

Let O
's O
say O
I O
was O
a O
hair O
away O
from O
zero O
, O
which O
was O
half O
of O
the O
second B-ORG
category I-ORG
ranking O
. O

But O
it O
must O
be O
said O
that O
- O
2/6 O
in O
Italy B-LOC
there O
were O
three O
or O
four O
and O
four O
or O
five O
were O
the O
first B-ORG
category I-ORG
. O

So O
you O
got O
high O
? O

" O
Well O
, O
enough O
. O

Then O
you O
decided O
to O
become O
a O
teacher O
. O

" O
It O
was O
the O
only O
outlet O
. O

The O
second B-ORG
category O
tournaments O
were O
few O
, O
you O
had O
to O
play O
a O
lot O
, O
there O
were O
no O
sponsors O
. O

Difficult O
years O
, O
in O
short O
, O
even O
if O
I O
got O
some O
nice O
satisfactions O
, O
playing O
and O
winning O
with O
people O
who O
then O
made O
a O
career O
. O

Then O
I O
went O
to O
Rome B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
national B-ORG
school I-ORG
of O
masters O
, O
and O
in O
two O
years O
, O
in O
' O
68 O
, O
I O
graduated O
. O

Immediately O
I O
found O
a O
place O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC
, O
then O
, O
from O
' O
74 O
, O
I O
came O
to O
Riva B-LOC
. O

And O
here O
I O
am O
. O

Fresh O
as O
a O
daisy O
. O

" O
Enough O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
complaining O
in O
short O
. O

Also O
because O
I O
have O
always O
been O
able O
to O
work O
well O
and O
help O
many O
boys O
to O
grow O
. O

There O
are O
some O
nice O
names O
that O
came O
out O
of O
your O
school O
. O

" O
Andrea B-PER
and O
Luca B-PER
Stoppini O
, O
Enrico B-PER

.... O
many O
, O
in O
short O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
afraid O
to O
forget O
someone O
. O

Then O
we O
made O
the O
A B-ORG
series I-ORG
, O
I O
was O
the O
captain O
and O
not O
a O
player O
. O

There O
was O
Jack B-PER
Reader I-PER
- O
the O
experience O
with O
him O
was O
great O
because O
he O
brought O
a O
breath O
of O
fresh O
air O
- O
then O
Cohenour B-PER
, O
Filippeschi B-PER
, O

Minicis I-PER

A O
good O
team O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
enthusiasm O
also O
in O
the O
club O
. O

Speaking O
of O
enthusiasm O
, O
after O
the O
dark O
years O
, O
does O
it O
seem O
to O
you O
that O
tennis O
is O
slowly O
climbing O
the O
ladder O
? O

" O
It O
's O
true O
, O
but O
please O
let O
's O
say O
it O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
, O
very O
low O
. O

A O
life O
with O
a O
racket O
in O
hand O
, O
who O
knows O
how O
many O
characters O
, O
how O
many O
anecdotes O
. O

" O
Quite O
a O
few O
. O

I O
have O
played O
with O
Michele B-PER
Placido I-PER
, O
Antonella B-PER
Lualdi I-PER
and O
Fred B-PER
Bongusto I-PER
, O
I O
have O
collaborated O
with O
Graziano B-PER
Risi I-PER
, O
the O
current O
federal O
technical O
director O
, O
but O
above O
all O
I O
have O
had O
the O
good O
fortune O
, O
operating O
in O
a O
tourist O
area O
, O
to O
deal O
with O
masters O
of O
other O
nations O
, O
Germans O
, O
Slavs O
... O
" O

Is O
it O
more O
difficult O
to O
teach O
the O
backhand O
or O
to O
set O
a O
mentality O
? O

" O
The O
shot O
is O
the O
easiest O
thing O
, O
the O
difficult O
comes O
later O
. O

I O
have O
always O
preached O
that O
tennis O
, O
playing O
tennis O
, O
must O
be O
a O
joy O
even O
if O
you O
do O
it O
seriously O
. O

Then O
I O
realize O
that O
between O
parents O
and O
managers O
, O
kids O
are O
overloaded O
with O
expectations O
and O
therefore O
stress O
. O

We O
teachers O
have O
to O
move O
in O
between O
and O
that O
's O
the O
hardest O
part O
of O
our O
job O
. O

Do O
you O
now O
have O
children O
who O
can O
have O
a O
future O
? O

" O
Yes O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

Let O
's O
leave O
them O
children O
and O
allow O
them O
to O
grow O
up O
in O
peace O
. O

And O
in O
this O
my O

Corinne B-PER
( O
Martinelli B-PER

) O
and O
Bernardo B-PER
( O
Bernardinelli B-PER

are O
perfectly O
in O
tune O
. O

When O
will O
you O
stop O
? O

" O
When O
I O
will O
get O
tired O
of O
being O
on O
the O
field O
, O
when O
I O
will O
realize O
that O
I O
will O
start O
to O
let O
technical O
mistakes O
go O
by O
. O

That O
will O
be O
the O
signal O
that O
my O
career O

is O
over O

explain O
what O
this O

What O
is O
the O
Dance O
Circuit O
? O

" O
It O
is O
a O
project O
that O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
promotes O
in O
all O
Italian O
regions O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
making O
Italian O
and O
international O
dance O
known O
to O
an O
increasing O
number O
of O
people O
. O

A O
promotion O
of O
dance O
, O
as O
well O
as O
other O
European O
countries O
, O
realized O
by O
encouraging O
the O
circulation O
of O
shows O
, O
accompanied O
by O
training O
initiatives O
. O

What O
will O
this O
project O
bring O
to O
Trentino B-LOC
? O

" O
A O
greater O
presence O
of O
companies O
, O
dance O
performances O
and O
also O
a O
whole O
series O
of O
cultural O
and O
training O
activities O
: O

meetings O
, O
debates O
, O
workshops O
. O

But O
above O
all O
shows O
. O

The O
circuit O
provides O
that O
there O
is O
a O
minimum O
to O
access O
this O
national O
regulation O
: O

In O
one O
year O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
run O
on O
the O
provincial O
territory O
at O
least O
24 O
shows O
. O

Does O
this O
mean O
access O
to O
an O
important O
source O
of O
funding O
? O

" O
First O
of O
all O
, O
a O
significant O
subsidy O
; O

But O
the O
' O
interest O
is O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
is O
identified O
as O
one O
of O
the O
territories O
on O
which O
to O
take O
root O
a O
circuit O
, O
which O
has O
national O
breath O
. O

It O
is O
also O
a O
recognition O
for O
the O
association O
" O
Incontri B-ORG
Internazionali I-ORG
" O
of O
Rovereto B-LOC
for O
the O
work O
done O
through O
the O
Festival O
and O
the O
CID B-ORG
. O

An O
extremely O
positive O
news O
for O
us O
and O
for O
Rovereto B-LOC
, O
which O
is O
the O
seat O
of O
both O
realities O
: O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
becomes O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
territories O
on O
a O
national O
level O
and O
not O
only O
in O
the O
field O
of O
contemporary O
dance O
. O

You O
have O
been O
chosen O
as O
the O
' O
only O
official O
referent O
: O

Will O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
institution O
be O
changed O
to O
manage O
the O
new O
function O
and O
the O
availability O
of O
funds O
? O

" O
No O
, O
absolutely O
nothing O
will O
change O
, O
because O
this O
is O
an O
activity O
that O
will O
be O
added O
to O
that O
of O
the O
festival O
. O

The O
association B-ORG
already O
operates O
in O
the O
field O
of O
dance O
at O
an O
international O
level O
. O

It O
has O
the O
necessary O
organizational O
skills O
, O
a O
long O
experience O
and O
relationships O
with O
companies O
and O
institutes O
, O
which O
according O
to O
the O
ministry O
put O
it O
in O
a O
position O
to O
organize O
the O
circuit O
at O
its O
best O
. O

What O
will O
happen O
to O
Verona B-LOC
and O
Mantua O
, O
which O
have O
just O
become O
part O
of O
the O
festival O
program O
? O

" O
The O
circuits O
are O
regional O
. O

Veneto B-LOC
already O
has O
its O
own O
, O
which O
has O
been O
operating O
for O
2 O
years O
. O

Lombardy B-LOC
has O
recently O
obtained O
recognition O
of O
its O
own O
. O

We O
will O
try O
to O
coordinate O
all O
the O
circuits O
in O
order O
to O
better O
organize O
the O
programming O
. O

Will O
the O
association B-ORG
establish O
the O
dance O
seasons O
of O
the O
main O
theaters O
in O
the O
province B-LOC
? O

Will O
it O
have O
a O
say O
and O
will O
it O
sign O
this O
part O
of O
the O
seasons O
' O
playbills O
? O

" O
Each O
municipality O
, O
each O
season O
will O
maintain O
its O
autonomy O
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
that O
is O
imposed O
. O

This O
is O
one O
more O
opportunity O
, O
one O
more O
dance O
offer O
available O
to O
the O
whole O
territory O
. O

It O
should O
also O
be O
kept O
in O
mind O
that O
there O
are O
no O
dance O
seasons O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
; O

There O
are O
sporadic O
performances O
, O
but O
no O
structured O
programs O
or O
even O
a O
circuit O
. O

With O
this O
ministerial O
entrusting O
there O
is O
instead O
the O
possibility O
of O
networking O
a O
series O
of O
municipalities O
that O
want O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
opportunity O
to O
create O
a O
circuit O
that O
is O
also O
in O
real O
dance O
seasons O
. O

Will O
the O
festival O
then O
find O
a O
way O
to O
assign O
the O
funds O
that O
have O
been O
made O
available O
to O
other O
organizations O
and O
companies O
that O
do O
dance O
? O

" O
The O
ministerial O
fund O
is O
entrusted O
to O
" O
Incontri B-ORG
Internazionali I-ORG
" O
of O
Rovereto B-LOC

This O
makes O
it O
possible O
to O
organize O
a O
project O
to O
which O
other O
funds O
can O
be O
added O
, O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
municipalities O
or O
the O
province B-LOC
. O

This O
will O
give O
the O
possibility O
of O
organizing O
an O
even O
larger O
and O
more O
important O
system O
than O
can O
be O
done O
with O
ministerial O
contributions O
alone O
. O

So O
, O
will O
other O
local O
collaborations O
be O
started O
? O

" O
At O
a O
local O
level O
, O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
possibility O
on O
which O
it O
will O
always O
be O
possible O
to O
engage O
. O

In O
the O
intentions O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
is O
an O
initiative O
that O
should O
stimulate O
the O
' O
addition O
of O
other O
funding O
and O
other O
collaborations O
by O
municipalities O
or O
other O
organizations O

Are O
you O
already O
able O
to O
indicate O
some O
of O
them O
? O

" O
We O
are O
waiting O
for O
the O
Ministry O
to O
define O
the O
amount O
to O
be O
entrusted O

This O
also O
depends O
on O
the O
financing O
of O
the O
FUS O

Fund O
of O
the O

, O
and O
will O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
financial O
maneuver O
. O

When O
we O
know O
how O
much O
will O
be O
available O

us O
we O
will O
begin O
contacts O
with O

The O
Trentino B-ORG
does O
not O
leave O

indeed O
it O
doubles O
. O

The O
Giallobl√π O
Board O
of O
Directors O
, O
called O
for O
next O
week O
, O
will O
be O
able O
to O
deliberate O
the O
increase O
of O
social O
capital O
, O
since O
other O
nine O
partners O
are O
ready O
to O
enter O
the O
control O
room O
of O
via B-ORG
Sanseverino I-ORG
. O

Among O
these O
are O
some O
companies O
- O
mostly O
from O
Trentino O
- O
such O
as O
Tecnostile B-ORG
or O
Isocold B-ORG
that O
will O
join O
, O
as O
sponsors O
, O
their O
brand O
to O
the O
Aquila O
team O
; O

but O
also O
artisan O
companies O
, O
such O
as O
Mauro B-PER
Giacca I-PER
's O
, O
who O
after O
many O
trumpet O
blasts O
out O
of O
time O
, O
this O
time O
will O
actually O
enter O
the O
business O
. O

It O
seems O
there O
are O
even O
those O
, O
like O
Francesco B-PER
Giovanelli I-PER
, O
one O
of O
Isocold B-ORG
's O
partners O
, O
willing O
to O
enter O
the O
company O
on O
a O
personal O
basis O
. O

From O
each O
of O
the O
new O
nine O
will O
arrive O
to O
rimpolpare O
the O
Trentino B-ORG
a O
quota O
of O
15 O
thousand O
euros O
; O

Overall O
, O
the O
share O
capital O
would O
thus O
rise O
to O
270,000 O
euros O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
missing O
would O
be O
the O
so O
much O
flaunted O
, O
promised O
, O
expected O
and O
still O
not O
guaranteed O
participation O
of O
public O
money O
, O
with O
the O
Cooperation B-ORG
that O
niches O
and O
the O
brand O
to O
be O
put O
on O
the O
shirts O
( O
with O
its O
assignments O
to O
be O
sealed O
in O
the O
safe O
) O
that O
is O
still O
missing O
. O

Instead O
, O
private O
individuals O
seem O
to O
have O
done O
their O
part O
; O

And O
the O
enlargement O
of O
the O
corporate O
structure O
would O
be O
a O
concrete O
proof O
of O
it O
and O
that O
makes O
the O
optimism O
grow O
around O
the O
yellow O
- O
blue O
colors O
" O
launched O
" O
in O
the O
field O
by O
the O
enterprises O
of O
Christian B-PER

now O
relaunched O
also O

On O
the O

however O

amiably O

" O
We O

also O
of O

. O

This O
is O
the O
project O
of O
the O
mountain O
running O
champion O
Stefano B-PER
Sartori I-PER
from O
Pergine O
who O
will O
leave O
this O
evening O
for O
Nepal B-LOC
to O
try O
to O
achieve O
the O
record O
on O
the O
Annapurna B-LOC
tour O
. O

A O
challenge O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
share O
with O
the O
Apeiron B-ORG
association O
that O
in O
Nepal B-LOC
manages O
some O
solidarity O
projects O
, O
including O
a O
home O
for O
mothers O
in O
need O
and O
other O
support O
structures O
and O
abandoned O

. O

The O
enterprise O
will O
also O
serve O
to O
publicize O
and O
support O
the O
activities O
of O
Apeiron B-ORG
, O
since O
Sartori B-PER
's O
sponsors O
have O
also O
given O
a O
contribution O
to O
the O
association O
, O
which O
also O
has O
an O
office O
in O
Pergine B-LOC
, O
whose O
manager O
is O
the O
lawyer O
Giuseppe B-PER
Benanti I-PER
. O

From O
a O
sporting O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
enterprise O
is O
rather O
challenging O
. O

It O
is O
the O
most O
famous O
long O
trek O
in O
the O
Himalayas B-LOC
, O
210 O
kilometers O
with O
a O
route O
that O
starts O
from O
an O
altitude O
of O
800 O
meters O
, O
climbs O
up O
to O
5 O
thousand O
and O
then O
descends O
to O
the O
starting O
altitude O
. O

So O
far O
the O
record O
of O
the O
route O
is O
nine O
days O
, O
established O
by O
four O
Germans O
. O

Sartori B-PER
counts O
on O
taking O
four O
days O
. O

The O
champion O
from O
Pergola O
is O
not O
new O
to O
such O
enterprises O
. O

In O
1998 O
he O
came O
second O
at O
the O
world O
championship O
of O
high O
altitude O
marathons O
in O
Tibet B-LOC
. O

This O
year O
he O
came O
eighth O
in O
the O
world O
championship O
of O
the O
100 O
kilometers O
in O
Holland B-LOC
. O

In O
his O
career O
, O
he O
has O
won O
the O
hundred O
kilometers O
of O
the O
Passatore O
twice O
and O
has O
won O
numerous O
other O
races O
. O

His O
specialty O
has O
become O
the O
so O
- O
called O
ultramarathons O
, O
a O
challenge O
to O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
impossible O
for O
normal O
people O
, O
daily O
bread O
for O
him O
. O

Sartori B-PER
, O
however O
, O
does O
not O
hide O
the O
difficulties O
: O

" O
The O
goal O
I O
have O
set O
myself O
is O
to O
run O
the O
210 O
kilometers O
in O
the O
shortest O
time O
possible O
. O

In O
theory O
I O
could O
do O
it O
in O
four O
days O
, O
thinking O
that O
I O
could O
do O
52 O
kilometers O
a O
day O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
said O
. O

The O
greatest O
difficulty O
is O
given O
by O
the O
altitude O
. O

The O
departure O
is O
at O
840 O
meters O
, O
then O
you O
go O
up O
to O
5 O
thousand O
and O
400 O
meters O
and O
finally O
you O
go O
down O
again O
. O

The O
route O
is O
the O
classic O
one O
of O
the O
Annapurna B-LOC
trek O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
famous O
in O
the O
Himalayas B-LOC
. O

I O
have O
already O
run O
at O
high O
altitudes O
. O

In O
1998 O
I O
arrived O
second O
in O
the O
world O
championship O
in O
Tibet B-LOC
and O
I O
saw O
that O
I O
react O
well O
, O
but O
each O
race O
is O
a O
separate O
undertaking O
. O

We O
'll O
have O
to O
see O
how O
it O
goes O
this O
time O
. O

The O
real O
enterprise O
will O
begin O
on O
October O
16th O
, O
after O
a O
few O
days O
of O
acclimatization O
. O

The O
following O
day O
Sartori B-PER
should O
climb O
up O
to O
the O
Thorong B-LOC
pass I-LOC
and O
from O
there O
begin O
the O
descent O
to O
the O
finish O
line O
. O

He O
will O
run O
on O
a O
path O
about O
one O
meter O
wide O
and O
he O
will O
sleep O
in O
the O
lodges O
that O
usually O
welcome O
the O
hikers O
who O
will O
try O
their O
hand O
at O
trekking O
. O

To O
eat O
, O
Sartori B-PER
will O
have O
to O
make O
do O
: O

" O
I O
'll O
carry O
in O
my O
backpack O
some O
bars O
of O
supplements O
and O
pieces O
of O
granola O
that O
give O
energy O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
I O
will O
eat O
in O
the O
lodges O
. O

For O
the O
accommodation O
, O
there O
will O
be O
some O
things O
that O
the O
porters O
will O
bring O
before O
departure O
. O

From O
that O
point O
of O
view O
there O
should O
be O
no O
problems O
. O

Problems O
should O
not O
be O
created O
even O
by O
the O
Maoist O
rebels O
who O
now O
control O
most O
of O
the O
Nepalese O
territory O
: O

" O
From O
what O
I O
know O
- O
explains O
Sartori B-PER
- O
they O
have O
never O
touched O
the O
tourists O
, O
also O
because O
they O
know O
that O
they O
bring O
valuable O
currency O
and O
they O
also O
buy O
local O
artifacts O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
happen O
is O
that O
they O
stop O
you O
and O
give O
you O
a O
speech O
about O
their O
Maoist O
principles O
, O
then O
they O
let O
you O
go O
after O
asking O
for O
a O
few O
dollars O
. O

In O
short O
, O
there O
should O
be O
no O
particular O
dangers O
. O

There O
remains O
the O
unknown O
represented O
by O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
enterprise O
added O
to O
the O
altitude O
: O

" O
I O
have O
just O
won O
a O
fifty O
kilometer O
race O
on O
the O
flat O
in O
more O
than O
three O
hours O
. O

At O
those O
altitudes O
I O
calculate O
to O
take O
six O
hours O
, O
if O
all O
goes O
well O
. O

We O
hope O
to O
keep O
this O
pace O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
no O
precedents O
on O
which O
to O
base O
ourselves O
. O

The O
only O
ones O
are O
these O
Germans O
who O
have O
done O
it O
in O
nine O
days O
, O
but O
there O
were O
four O
of O
them O
. O

Something O
like O
this O
is O
nice O
to O
do O
alone O
. O

also O
those O
of O

I O
remember O

But O
, O
at O
" O
only O
" O
45 O

it O

is O
a O
path O
that O
will O
involve O
in O
a O
participatory O
manner O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
various O
stakeholders O
, O
internal O
and O
external O
to O
the O
movement O
, O
and O
that O
will O
result O
in O
the O
definition O
of O
the O
strategic O
plan O
. O

The O
project O
, O
presented O
yesterday O
by O
the O
general O
manager O
, O
Carlo B-PER
Dellasega I-PER
, O
will O
involve O
a O
listening O
operation O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
of O
those O
who O
, O
like O
the O
board B-ORG
of I-ORG
directors I-ORG
itself O
, O
the O
committee O
and O
the O
second O
level O
consortiums O
, O
are O
directly O
involved O
with O
Via B-ORG
Segantini I-ORG
. O

The O
need O
to O
make O
the O
Federation B-ORG
's O
structure O
more O
efficient O
and O
rational O
is O
one O
of O
the O
objectives O
that O
Dellasega B-PER
set O
himself O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
was O
officially O
appointed O
director O
. O

Within O
a O
few O
months O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
strategic O
plan O
should O
take O
shape O
, O
which O
will O
have O
to O
define O
first O
of O
all O
the O
objectives O
that O
the O
Federation B-ORG
intends O
to O
achieve O
in O
relation O
to O
its O
member O
cooperatives O
which O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
are O
also O
customers O
. O

It O
is O
precisely O
on O
this O
double O
role O
of O
adherents O
to O
an O
organization O
that O
must O
be O
a O
trade O
union O
and O
customers O
who O
use O
the O
services O
of O
Via B-ORG
Segantini I-ORG
, O
that O
the O
strategic O
plan O
will O
be O
drawn O
up O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
future O
reorganization O
of O
the O
trade O
union O
led O
by O
Diego B-PER
Schelfi I-PER
. O

According O
to O
what O
had O
been O
repeatedly O
stated O
by O
the O
director O
and O
the O
president O
himself O
, O
the O
need O
to O
change O
, O
in O
cascade O
, O
" O
the O
procedures O
and O
methods O
, O
not O
the O
men O
" O
of O
the O
Federation B-ORG
. O

A O
change O
that O
both O
Schelfi B-PER
and O
Dellasega B-PER
want O
to O
be O
shared O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
in O
order O
to O
give O
a O
different O
gear O
to O
the O
organization O
. O

Starting O
with O
communication O
, O
both O
internal O
and O
external O
, O
and O
continuing O
with O
the O
ability O
to O
provide O
services O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
members O
. O

Just O
think O
of O
how O
many O
cooperatives O
, O
especially O
small O
ones O
, O
need O
the O
Federation B-ORG
's O
advice O
now O
that O
they O
have O
to O
move O
towards O
the O
new O
rules O
defined O

intriguing O
and O

by O
ALESSANDRO B-PER
FRANCESCHINI I-PER

Imagine O
if O
' O
art O
entered O
the O
world O
of O
work O
. O

Imagine O
your O
office O
emptied O
of O
everything O
, O
the O

of O

be O
processed O

This O
is O
not O
a O
delirium O
of O
the O

on O
duty O
and O
not O
even O
the O
last O
episode O
of O
mobbing O
. O

It O
is O
instead O
what O
happened O
last O
Saturday O
at O
a O
' O
company O
in O
Trento B-LOC
that O
has O
brought O
artists O

In O

the O
Galleria B-ORG

to O
the O
idea O
and O

of O
Francesco B-PER

Maffei I-PER
Gueret I-PER
, O
until O
tomorrow O
it O
will O
be O
possible O
to O
visit O
the O
work O
of O
ten O
internationally O
renowned O
artists O
who O
have O
placed O
their O
work O
in O
the O
offices O
of O
work O
. O

This O
is O
an O
interesting O
idea O
that O
has O
as O
its O
objective O
the O
comparison O
with O
the O
" O
intermediate O
soul O
" O
. O

Hence O
the O
title O
of O
the O
event O
: O
" O
Interfacies O
" O
. O

To O
use O
the O
words O
of O
the O
curator O
Bonazzi B-PER
, O
in O
this O
week O
" O
Asteria O
will O
not O
only O
be O
the O
place O
of O
the O
event O
, O
crucible O
and O
crossroads O
of O
technical O
and O
creative O
synergies O
but O
also O
the O
fulcrum O
of O
exchanges O
and O
interactions O
. O

In O
this O
place O
, O
between O
media O
, O
multiple O
faces O
and O
borders O
, O
between O
connections O
and O
linguistic O
parameters O
, O
the O
artists O
are O
stimulated O
to O
make O
their O
language O
interact O
with O
new O
technologies O
. O

Let O
's O
see O
quickly O
and O
not O
exhaustively O
who O
the O
artists O
involved O
were O
and O
what O
they O
proposed O
. O

Starting O
from O
Antoni B-PER
Abad I-PER
who O
created O
a O
" O
benign O
" O
virus O
consisting O
of O
a O
fly O
made O
of O
pixels O
that O
wanders O
freely O
on O
the O
computer O
screen O
and O
through O
the O
Internet O
is O
able O
to O
multiply O
, O
thus O
giving O
rise O
to O
a O
swarm O
of O
virtual O
flies O
. O

We O
then O
move O
on O
to O
the O
works O
of O
Stefano B-PER
Cagol I-PER
and O
his O
games O
of O
splitting O
of O
the O
metropolitan O
horizon O
that O
propose O
alienating O
and O
familiar O
landscapes O
. O

Then O
it O
's O
Loris B-PER
Cecchini I-PER
's O
turn O
with O
his O
improbable O
and O
yet O
real O
architecture O
that O
realizes O
the O
project O
of O
a O
house O
for O
squatters O
built O
on O
a O
light O
pole O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
the O
dreamlike O
and O
imaginary O
landscapes O
of O
Eva B-PER
Marisaldi I-PER
who O
takes O
the O
spectators O
on O
an O
imperturbable O
journey O
. O

Takehito B-PER
Koganezawa I-PER
's O
work O
is O
astonishing O
, O
obtaining O
unbelievable O
symphonies O
by O
sampling O
images O
and O
noises O
of O
everyday O
life O
. O

Then O
the O
experimental O
video O
by O
Louis B-PER
Nero I-PER
who O
brings O
the O
experience O
of O
cinematography O
to O
video O
art O
with O
surprising O
results O
of O
poetry O
and O
existential O
suspension O
. O

The O
journey O
through O
the O
corridors O
of O
the O
company O
continues O
with O
the O
work O
of O
Oliver B-PER
Pietsch I-PER
with O
three O
fragments O
of O
a O
path O
between O
the O
surreal O
and O
the O
real O
. O

To O
follow O
Xenja B-PER
Plasma I-PER
with O
a O
video O
that O
is O
a O
lucid O
dream O
, O
obsessive O
and O
vibrant O
to O
the O
eternal O
search O
of O
hospitality O
. O

Sensual O
and O
transgressive O
is O
instead O
the O
work O
of O
Kiki B-PER
Seror I-PER
who O
borrows O
the O
verbal O
images O
of O
chat O
- O
line O
highlighting O
what O
the O
web O
produces O
and O
proposes O
. O

The O
collective O
performance O
concludes O
with O
a O
work O
by O
Giulia B-PER
Zuanni I-PER
who O
renounces O
communication O
through O
images O
, O
immersing O
the O
spectator O
in O
a O
dark O
and O
silent O
dyad O
made O
up O
only O
of O
intimate O
words O
, O
thus O
placing O
the O
spectator O
at O
the O
center O
of O
the O
artistic O
event O
. O

The O
experiment O
of O
Asteria B-ORG
is O
definitely O
successful O
. O

The O
inauguration O
was O
not O
only O
an O
occasion O
for O
artists O
and O
communicators O
to O
meet O
, O
but O
also O
an O
event O
open O
to O
the O
city O
and O
, O
basically O
, O
for O

with O
the O
pleasure O
of O
the O
iconoclast O

simplistic O
reasoning O

clich√©s O

The O
first O
: O

that O
between O
the O
West O
and O
the O
Islamic O
world O
, O
there O
are O
unbridgeable O
differences O
, O
an O
abyss O
of O
culture O
and O
history O
. O

" O
It O
is O
a O
tragic O
misunderstanding O
. O

The O
Muslim O
world O
has O
been O
part O
of O
Western O
culture O
since O
its O
formation O
, O
first O
of O
all O
for O
a O
historical O
and O
geographical O
factor O
: O

Islam O
has O
been O
present O
for O
example O
in O
Sicily B-LOC
, O
Spain B-LOC
and O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
. O

Then O
there O
are O
the O
common O
religious O
origins O
that O
we O
have O
in O
the O
Abrahamic O
tradition O
and O
in O
the O
deep O
bond O
given O
by O
the O
belief O
in O
the O
oneness O
of O
God B-PER

And O
then O
there O
is O
the O
common O
basis O
of O
Hellenism O
: O

Islamic O
culture O
in O
fact O
can O
not O
be O
understood O
without O
Plato B-PER

Aristotle B-PER

How O
can O
we O
talk O
about O
foreign O
cultures O
? O

" O

Yet O
relations O
between O
Islam O
and O
the O
Christian O
world O
have O
never O
been O
easy O
.... O

" O
This O
too O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
: O

Historically O
there O
has O
been O
a O
clash O

but O
also O
an O
encounter O
. O

Islam O
and O
Christianity O
first O
, O
and O
then O
Europe B-LOC

have O
had O
relations O
for O
thirteen O
centuries O
that O
have O
also O
been O
of O
violence O

always O
within O
a O

a O

never O

interrupted O
: O

Despite O
the O
crusades O
, O
commercial O

diplomatic O

cultural O
relations O
continued O

At O
times O
, O
however O
, O
an O
" O
ideology O
of O
confrontation O
" O
certainly O
prevailed O
. O
Particularly O
between O
1400 O
and O
1700 O

due O
to O
the O
fear O
of O
the O
Turks O
who O
were O
pressing O
on O

Europe B-LOC

And O
from O
the O
point O
of O

of O
the O
Muslim O
world O
, O
how O
was O
this O
relationship O
experienced O
? O

" O
Islam O
, O
too O
, O
has O
developed O
an O
" O
ideology O
of O

a O
mirror O
image O

after O
the O
experience O

It O
felt O
endangered O
by O
the O
Crusades O

by O

by O
the O
support O

revived O
its O
enmity O

Europe B-LOC

which O
has O
never O

And O
as O
in O
the O
West O
, O
the O
idea O
that O
a O
global O
conflict O
was O
underway O
developed O

But O
everything O
falls O
within O
the O
sphere O
of O
what O
we O

call O
small O

large O
optical O
phenomena O

I O
believe O

between O

it O
will O
never O
be O
possible O
to O
reach O
the O
level O
of O
hatred O

ferocity O
reached O

for O

, O
by O
the O
wars O
of O
religion O
in O
1400 O
- O
1500 O
in O
Europe B-LOC
. O

Yet O
these O
have O
not O
prevented O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
common O
European O
conscience O
. O

How O
then O
should O
we O
consider O
the O
failed O
attempt O
of O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Italian O
political O
world O
to O
insert O
in O
the O
European O
Constitution O
a O
reference O

the O
Christian O

" O
When O
we O
speak O
of O
cultural O
roots O
we O
must O
resist O
the O
simplistic O
and O
fundamentalist O
temptation O
of O
the O
' O

, O
because O
usually O
cultures O
develop O
on O
the O
' O

, O
that O
is O
, O
on O
the O
coexistence O
of O
different O
traditions O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
Europe B-LOC
has O
Christian O
roots O
, O
but O
these O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
are O
not O
the O
only O
ones O
. O

The O
Crusades O
began O
in O
a O
period O
of O
crisis O
of O
Christianity O
, O
cultural O
and O
economic O
: O

It O
looks O
like O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
Arab O
countries O
today O
. O

Is O
Islam O
's O
crusade O
upside O
down O
? O

" O
No O
. O

In O
the O
Islam O
of O
today O
there O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
process O
, O
very O
limited O
qualitatively O
and O
quantitatively O
, O
of O
degeneration O
, O
which O
has O
typically O
Western O
roots O
and O
connotations O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
latest O
developments O
in O
globalization O
, O
which O
accentuates O
and O
makes O
evident O
to O
all O
the O
enormous O
inequalities O
between O
the O
West O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Islamic O
world O
has O
identified O
the O
development O
of O
rich O
countries O
as O
the O
reason O
for O
Muslim O
decadence O
. O

It O
started O
from O
a O
historically O
true O
observation O
, O
which O
is O
however O
used O
in O
a O
captious O
way O
to O
justify O
the O
necessity O
of O
the O
holy O
war O
. O

What O
are O
our O
responsibilities O
in O
all O
this O
? O

" O
European O
culture O
today O
is O
in O
the O
grip O
of O
a O
dangerous O
schizophrenia O
: O

We O
have O
built O
our O
identity O
for O
at O
least O
three O
centuries O
on O
values O
such O
as O
equality O
, O
freedom O
and O
social O
justice O
that O
we O
continue O
not O
to O
respect O
in O
relations O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

And O
so O
the O
fundamentalist O
reaction O
is O
also O
a O
reaction O
to O
the O
disillusionment O
caused O
to O
Muslim O
countries O
by O
contact O
with O
the O
West O
, O
which O
first O
promised O
independence O
and O
development O
and O
then O
denied O
everything O
. O

But O
why O
has O
religion O
become O
the O
vehicle O
for O
this O
clash O
? O

" O
Because O
the O
religious O
discourse O
has O
a O
hold O
in O
an O
Islamic O
world O
made O
of O
1.3 O
billion O
people O
who O
are O
part O
of O
the O
80 O
% O
of O

Faced O
with O
this O
element O
of O
colossal O
injustice O
, O
what O
is O
the O
language O
that O
a O
political O
agitator O
could O
choose O
to O
strike O
consciences O
? O

It O
is O
the O
religious O
language O
that O
indicates O
in O
the O
Western O
" O
Jewish O
- O
Christian O
- O
atheist O
" O
world O
" O
the O
great O
Satan O
guilty O
of O
everything O
" O
. O

Where O
does O
fundamentalism O
come O
from O
? O

" O
The O
Islamic O
fundamentalist O
movement O
is O
a O
new O
movement O
born O
in O
the O
1920s O
as O
a O
short O
circuit O
in O
front O
of O
the O
violence O
of O
Western O
expansion O
. O

There O
is O
a O
rediscovery O
of O
religious O
values O
paradoxically O
lived O
in O
a O
very O
western O
, O
ideologized O
way O
: O

It O
is O
the O
image O
of O
an O
Islam O
at O
war O
that O
must O
win O
against O
the O
western O
Satan O
that O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
traditional O
one O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
efforts O
that O
we O
make O
with O
our O
choices O
to O
propagandize O
fundamentalism O
, O
the O
Muslims O
who O
adhere O
to O
it O
are O
few O
, O
and O
for O
this O
reason O
I O
believe O
that O
fundamentalism O
will O
never O
develop O
more O
. O

Yet O
the O
attacks O
continue O
, O
indeed O
, O
the O
intensity O
of O
violence O
increases O
.... O

" O
But O
it O
is O
precisely O
for O
this O
reason O
that O
terrorist O
movements O
become O
more O
and O
more O
dangerous O
: O

because O
they O
realize O
that O
their O
area O
of O
development O
is O
very O
limited O
and O
then O
they O
harden O
their O
practice O
. O

Hence O
the O
Beslan B-LOC
tragedy O
was O
born O
. O
" O

Let O
's O
explore O
instead O
the O
opposite O
field O
, O
the O
Western O
one O
. O

Is O
n't O
the O
war O
against O
terrorism O
in O
danger O
of O
having O
all O
the O
characteristics O
of O
a O
politically O
and O
religiously O
fundamentalist O
crusade O
? O

" O
There O
is O
an O
aspect O
, O
for O
example O
regarding O
Bush B-PER
and O
his O
circle O
, O
that O
if O
I O
were O
not O
a O
believer O
I O
would O
call O
a O
religious O
involution O
in O
a O
fanatical O
sense O
. O

I O
am O
a O
practicing O
Catholic O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
talk O
about O
religious O
involution O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
return O
to O
crude O
forms O
of O
relationship O
between O
religion O
and O
politics O
. O

When O
I O
see O
the O
images O
of O
Americans O
praying O
at O
Ground O
Zero O
, O
I O
smell O
the O
mass O
media O
's O
stupidity O
and O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
fanatical O
ideological O
apparatus O
. O

Praying O
all O
together O
in O
front O
of O
the O
television O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
is O
not O
my O
way O
of O
understanding O
religion O
. O

In O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
there O
is O
an O
old O
fundamentalist O
Protestant O
root O
, O
connected O
to O
what O
they O
call O
the O
" O
manifest O
destiny O
" O
of O
the O
nation O
. O

Is O
this O
religion O
? O

It O
's O
a O
political O
view O
of O
faith O
. O

Does O
it O
mean O
a O
spirit O
of O
crusade O
? O

Certainly O
, O
it O
exists O
in O
the O
Islamic O
Jihad O
but O
also O
in O
the O
current O
Western O
world O
" O
. O

How O
to O
get O
out O
of O
this O
vicious O
circle O
? O

Is O
it O
possible O
? O

" O
Not O
at O
this O
moment O
. O

The O
only O
way O
is O
to O
dismantle O
the O
Manichaean O
vision O
that O
the O
media O
, O
supported O
by O
politicians O
and O
strong O
powers O
, O
are O
feeding O
us O
, O
of O
a O
world O
divided O
in O
two O
between O
Evil O
and O
Good O
. O

We O
must O
react O
as O
they O
did O
in O
France B-LOC
after O
the O
kidnapping O
of O
journalists O
. O

As O
a O
right O
- O
wing O
man O
and O
as O
a O
European O
citizen O
I O
have O
been O
proud O
of O
the O
national O
feeling O
of O
unity O
, O
of O
compactness O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
the O
French O
express O
. O

In O
what O
sense O
? O

" O
They O
did O
n't O
give O
in O
to O
blackmail O
: O

The O
kidnappers O
who O
demanded O
the O
abolition O
of O
the O
law O
on O
the O
veil O
in O
a O
united O
way O
, O
from O
right O
to O
left O
, O
were O
answered O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
law O
against O
Muslims O
and O
the O
same O
Muslim O
community O
, O
opposed O
to O
the O
law O
, O
rejected O
external O
interference O
. O

But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
France B-LOC
is O
also O
not O
aligned O
with O
the O
United B-LOC

and O
has O
another O
idea O

what O
should O
be O
done O
in O
Iraq B-LOC

in O
particular O
the O
role O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG

The O
logic O
of O

from O
opposite O
sides O
is O
to O
make O
us O
become O
partisans O

camp O

" O
Sometimes O
he O
was O
a O

But O
he O
was O
a O
man O
who O
knew O

He O
had O
been O
a O

he O

Someone O
labeled O
him O

" O
An O
important O
part O

my O
life O
, O
we O
lived O
30 O
years O
of O
politics O
together O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
remember O
that O
Iginio B-PER
, O
together O
with O
Alberto B-PER
Agostini I-PER
, O
was O
the O
one O
who O
fought O
for O
the O
first O
urban O
development O
plan O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Trento B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
70s O
. O

A O
free O
man O
, O
he O
accepted O
the O
confrontation O
with O
an O
open O
face O
. O

So O
many O
announcements O
and O
the O
usual O
promises O
: O

but O
the O
bicycle O
life O
is O
always O
harder O

The O
mockery O
of O
bicycle O
paths O

The O
other O
day O
the O
umpteenth O
accident O
involving O
a O
cyclist O
. O

At O
the O
intersection O
of O
Via B-LOC
Vittorio I-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
and O
Via B-LOC
Lorenzoni I-LOC
: O

on O
the O
cycle O
- O
pedestrian O
stripes O
, O
he O
was O
" O
shot O
down O
" O
by O
a O
car O
passing O
through O
the O
now O
famous O
traffic O
circle O
. O

Fortunately O
there O
were O
no O
serious O
consequences O
: O

The O
man O
has O
reported O
a O
trauma O
to O
the O
head O
, O
but O
has O
never O
lost O
consciousness O
and O
was O
accompanied O
to O
the O
hospital O
by O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
for O
investigation O
. O

The O
accident O
, O
however O
, O
raises O
a O
series O
of O
questions O
, O
which O
concern O
the O
micro O
( O
the O
mockery O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
bike O
path O
in O
Via B-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
) O
and O
macro O
( O
the O
policy O
for O
cyclists O
of O
the O
City B-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
) O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
Via B-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
, O
the O
soap O
opera O
of O
the O
bike O
path O
is O
now O
at O
its O
last O
stage O
, O
that O
of O
the O
de O
profundis O
. O

Inaugurated O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
path O
occupies O
half O
of O
the O
sidewalk O
, O
forcing O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
to O
live O
together O
in O
an O
impossible O
situation O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
is O
not O
even O
a O
bike O
path O
: O

It O
is O
just O
a O
white O
strip O
of O
paint O
. O

The O
bike O
path O
of O
Via B-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
has O
always O
been O
a O
colossal O
joke O
: O

Dangerous O
for O
the O
safety O
of O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
, O
it O
ends O
unexpectedly O
in O
nothing O
. O

At O
the O
crossroads O
of O
Via B-LOC
Mattioli I-LOC
, O
it O
crashes O
straight O
into O
the O
new O
cast O
iron O
railings O
. O

In O
some O
places O
( O
in O
front O
of O
the O
" O
Bronzetti O
" O
) O
it O
is O
less O
than O
forty O
centimeters O
wide O
, O
which O
must O
be O
enough O
for O
cyclists O
passing O
in O
both O
directions O
. O

If O
the O
Public B-ORG
Works I-ORG
Inspectorate I-ORG
applied O
the O
Highway O
Code O
, O
it O
would O
have O
to O
denounce O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
. O

It O
's O
enough O
to O
look O
a O
few O
kilometers O
from O
here O
( O
I O
'm O
not O
saying O
Bolzano B-LOC
... O
just O
Rovereto B-LOC
) O
to O
notice O
two O
things O
: O

the O
bike O
lanes O
are O
separated O
from O
the O
pedestrian O
traffic O
; O

and O
are O
marked O
with O
red O
asphalt O
. O

And O
here O
the O
problem O
is O
more O
general O
, O
that O
of O
the O
policy O
of O
this O
city O
for O
cyclists O
. O

I O
vividly O
remember O
a O
press O
conference O
in O
1986 O
in O
which O
Councilman O
Roberto B-PER
De I-PER
Bernardis I-PER
, O
riding O
a O
regular O
bicycle O
, O
summoned O
the O
press O
to O
the O
" O
Marinaio O
" O
to O
explain O
that O
by O
1994 O
Trento B-LOC
would O
have O
an O
" O
efficient O
network O
of O
bike O
paths O
from O
north O
to O
south O
and O
in O
the O
historic O
center O
. O

Bullshit O
. O

For O
so O
many O
years O
they O
have O
been O
making O
fun O
of O
us O
. O

We O
cyclists O
, O
who O
are O
trying O
to O
fight O
smog O
and O
promote O
healthier O
and O
more O
ecological O
mobility O
, O
are O
sacrificed O
on O
the O
altar O
of O
motors O
. O

When O
we O
are O
not O
" O
shot O
down O
" O
at O
the O
cycle O
- O
pedestrian O
crossings O
as O
happened O
to O
the O
unfortunate O
yesterday O
. O

But O
you O
know O
, O
Trento B-LOC
is O
an O
" O
Alpine O
city O
of O
2004 O
" O
. O

That O
means O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
; O

But O
in O
reality O
, O
the O
music O
is O
always O
the O
same O
: O

On O
two O
wheels O
, O
you O
risk O
your O
skin O
. O

And O
they O
even O
make O
fun O
of O
you O
. O
