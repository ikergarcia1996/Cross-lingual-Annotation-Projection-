him O
from O

This O

he O
explains O

absorbs O
much O

time O
is O
elastic O

I O
am O
willing O

Yesterday O
it O
was O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
Faculty B-ORG
of I-ORG
Cognitive I-ORG
Sciences I-ORG
was O
inaugurated O
. O

At O
the O
Italian O
level O
the O
cuts O
make O
life O
more O
difficult O
: O

There O
are O
rules O
that O
are O
too O
strict O
. O

In O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
thanks O
to O
autonomy O
, O
things O
are O
much O
better O
. O

In O
his O
view O
, O
more O
and O
more O
emphasis O
should O
be O
placed O
on O
scientific O
research O
: O

The O
University B-ORG
has O
its O
own O
expertise O
. O

Often O
the O
search O
does O
not O
guarantee O
immediate O
results O
. O

These O
are O
long O
- O
term O
investments O
, O
which O
sometimes O
lead O
to O
unthinkable O
outlets O
. O

In O
Trentino B-LOC
we O
talk O
about O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
district O
of O
hydrogen O
and O
renewable O
energy O
. O

Is O
this O
the O
sector O
to O
be O
invested O
in O
? O

The O
issue O
is O
complex O
. O

Trento B-LOC
certainly O
can O
not O
miss O
the O
opportunity O
to O
invest O
in O
clean O
energies O
such O
as O
hydrogen O
. O

The O
speech O
applies O
both O
to O
academia O
and O
business O
. O

The O
University B-ORG
will O
have O
a O
new O
rector O
and O
the O
possibility O
to O
plan O
investments O
. O

Renewable O
energy O
is O
a O
key O
road O
, O
but O
there O
is O
also O
room O
for O
other O
sectors O
. O

Then O
one O
should O
not O
underestimate O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
Faculty B-ORG
of I-ORG
Cognitive I-ORG
Sciences I-ORG
, O
which O
has O
large O
potentials O
. O

When O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
University O
of O
Trentino O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
fundamental O
role O
that O
have O
had O
the O
funding O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

Then O
there O
are O
research O
projects O
at O
national O
level O
. O

But O
can O
economic O
support O
come O
from O
private O
enterprise O
in O
the O
future O
? O

I O
believe O
that O
private O
individuals O
will O
never O
give O
too O
much O
to O
research O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
can O
come O
and O
they O
must O
come O
contributions O
also O
from O
companies O
, O
but O
their O
role O
is O
another O
: O

may O
identify O
the O
most O
promising O

In O
the O
seasonal O
debut O
on O
Sunday O
against O
the O
freshman O
Ferrara O
, O
in O
which O
the O
Arco B-ORG
failed O
to O
go O
beyond O

, O
and O

element O
of O
the O
arcense O
game O
( O

experience O
in O

for O
having O
played O

, O
Rovereto B-ORG
, O
Arzignano B-ORG
, O
Bassano B-ORG

) O
had O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
bench O
for O
a O
problem O
to O
the O
adductor O
suffered O
the O
week O
before O
and O
that O
does O
not O
allow O
him O
to O
be O
100 O
% O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
yellow O
- O
blue O
captain O
declares O
himself O
confident O
: O

As O
far O
as O
my O
physical O
condition O
is O
concerned O
, O
I O
do O
not O
feel O
that O
I O
am O
unbalanced O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

We O
hope O
that O
the O
problem O
does O
not O
evolve O
in O
a O
tendinopathy O
, O
otherwise O
the O
recovery O
times O
would O
be O
longer O
; O

For O
now O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
I O
will O
do O
everything O
to O
be O
on O
the O
field O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
maybe O
already O
next O
Sunday O
, O
when O
we O
will O
be O
on O
stage O
in O
Salò B-LOC
, O
a O
trip O
that O
deserves O
all O
our O
attention O
. O

Analyzing O
yesterday O
's O
match O
, O
I O
think O
we O
paid O
dearly O
for O
the O
emotion O
of O
the O
debut O
in O
front O
of O
our O
audience O
. O

We O
were O
very O
keen O
to O
do O
well O
and O
start O
with O
the O
right O
foot O
, O
but O
we O
must O
not O
forget O
that O
for O
many O
of O
my O
companions O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time O
in O
this O
series O
. O

Despite O
everything O
, O
I O
think O
we O
have O
played O
a O
great O
game O
, O
putting O
in O
the O
field O
all O
the O
intensity O
we O
are O
capable O
of O
. O

In O
the O
very O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
meeting O
we O
were O
not O
brilliant O
, O
I O
admit O
, O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
first O
time O
we O
tried O
to O
play O
the O
game O
and O
impose O
our O
game O
and O
I O
also O
believe O
, O
that O
for O
long O
stretches O
, O
we O
succeeded O
quite O
well O
. O

Let O
's O
not O
forget O
the O
goal O
ball O
on O
Toccoli B-PER
's O
feet O
( O
in O

goals O
finding O
the O
parade O
of O
Atti B-PER
's O
foot O
, O
ed O
) O
, O
where O
their O
goalkeeper O
was O
good O
to O
oppose O
with O
the O
feet O
, O
and O
also O
the O
goal O
canceled O
at O
Dal B-PER
Ferro I-PER
for O
a O
millimeter O
outgame O
. O

In O
the O
second O
half O
the O
heat O
became O
the O
absolute O
protagonist O
. O

Surely O
we O
have O
suffered O
more O
than O
them O
, O
but O
probably O
this O
is O
also O
due O
to O
the O
physical O
structure O
: O

They O
are O
players O
more O
minutes O
and O
faster O
than O
we O
are O
. O

Now O
we O
are O
in O
front O
all O
week O
to O
work O
and O
to O
prepare O
to O
the O
best O
for O
the O
next O
game O
, O
correcting O
the O
mistakes O
made O
, O
but O
starting O
from O
how O
good O
there O
was O
. O

I O
hope O
to O
return O
to O
the O
coach O
's O
disposal O
and O
I O
am O
confident O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
next O
week O
we O
will O
have O
a O
better O
basic O
physical O
condition O
than O
the O
one O

After O

up I-ORG
, O
the O
two O
most O
representative O
unions O
, O
have O
abandoned O

there O
is O

another O

The O
clash O
between O
the O
Trentino O

unions O
on O
the O
renewal O
of O
the O

has O
no O
precedent O
, O
neither O

nor O
at O

level O
- O
says O
Roberto B-PER
Vivian I-PER
, O

. O

Incitement O
to O

at O

makes O

difficult O
and O

. O

We O
are O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
electoral O
campaign O
for O
the O
renewal O
of O
the O
Rsu B-ORG
and O
the O
denial O
of O
certain O
trade O
union O
acronyms O
appears O
almost O
a O
strategy O
, O
with O
a O
view O
to O
the O
appointment O
of O
mid O
- O
November O
, O
the O
date O
of O
the O
elections O
. O

A O
common O
position O
must O
be O
found O
. O

Employment O
contracts O
can O
not O
be O
legitimated O
only O
by O
those O
who O
think O
they O
have O
the O
majority O
, O
especially O
when O
this O
majority O
is O
not O
representative O
of O
all O
the O
professionalism O
for O
which O
the O
contract O
is O
intended O
. O

The O
existing O
opposition O
is O
evidenced O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
five O
trade O
union O
organizations O
titled O
to O
the O
negotiation O
have O
presented O
five O
different O
platforms O
. O

This O
is O
a O
dangerous O
anomaly O
- O
continues O
Vivian B-PER
- O
. O

The O
contract O
must O
provide O
for O
wage O
increases O
linked O
to O
inflation O
, O
as O
was O
the O
case O
at O
national O
level O
. O

At O
this O
stage O
, O
in O
defense O
of O
salary O
, O
we O
will O
ask O
the O
Apran B-ORG
for O
the O
expected O
balance O
for O
2002 O
- O
2003 O
on O
salary O
to O
the O
same O
extent O
as O
the O
national O
health O
contract O
, O
even O
with O
a O
partial O
agreement O
to O
be O
signed O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
then O
continue O
negotiations O
on O
all O
other O
matters O
. O

To O
further O
complicate O
the O
dispute O
there O
is O
the O
question O
of O
the O
funds O
allocated O
, O
which O
are O
considered O
insufficient O
. O

CISL B-ORG
has O
won O
the O
appeal O
against O
the O
Health B-ORG
Company I-ORG
which O
, O
in O
the O
decentralised O
agreement O
, O
following O
the O
2002 O
provincial O
contract O
, O
used O
resources O
to O
retrain O
non O
- O
health O
staff O
for O
other O
purposes O
. O

It O
is O
300 O
thousand O
euros O
- O
recalls O
Pierachille B-PER
Dalledonne I-PER
, O

Uil B-ORG

- O
. O

But O
the O
appeal O
also O
lacks O
1,500,000 O
euros O
. O

We O
await O
the O
verification O
requested O
of O
the O
Apran B-ORG
on O
available O
resources O
, O
not O
only O
for O
2002 O

, O
but O
also O
for O
2004 O

Only O
then O
will O
we O
be O

whether O
additional O

are O

for O
which O
we O

the O

For O
France B-LOC
it O
would O
obviously O
be O
a O
big O
blow O
if O
the O
statement O

authentic O

President O

defused O

thanks O
to O
the O
extraordinary O

( O
" O
Either O

) O
. O

If O
he O
were O
now O
faced O
with O
new O
and O
equally O
unacceptable O
demands O
it O
would O
be O
an O
obvious O
failure O

his O
" O
diplomacy O

the O

aims O

positively O
resolve O
the O

itself O

thus O
cutting O
off O

The O
scepticism O
expressed O
by O
Raffarin B-PER
about O
the O
authenticity O
of O
the O
document O
is O
based O
on O
various O
considerations O
. O

The O
French O
diplomats O
involved O
in O
the O
forcing O
for O
the O
release O
of O
the O
two O
reporters O
underline O
that O
the O
text O
is O
not O
in O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
group O
" O
( O
incongruent O
appears O
above O
all O
the O
demand O

that O
any O

requests O
would O
be O
transmitted O
through O
channels O
other O
than O
an O
integralist O
site O

dubious O

The O
warning O

appears O
to O
the O
French O
that O
they O
do O

This O

for O
Scam O
Signifredi B-PER

The O
buyer O

not O
even O
paid O

thousand O

after O
the O

of O
the O
accountant O

Chini B-PER
feels O
cheated O
by O
Paolo B-PER
Signifredi I-PER
. O

For O
this O
reason O
the O
construction O
contractor O
filed O
a O
complaint O
against O
the O
accountant O
of O
Parma B-LOC
who O
had O
purchased O
the O
Chini B-ORG
constructions I-ORG
for O
a O
thousand O
euros O
, O
money O
that O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
Signifredi B-PER
never O
paid O
. O

Signifredi B-PER
a O
few O
days O
after O
the O
purchase O
of O
Chini B-ORG
was O
arrested O
by O
the O
Finance O
Guard O
because O
he O
had O
to O
serve O
a O
three O
- O
year O
sentence O
for O
the O
recuperation O
and O
recycling O
of O
a O
car O
. O

Signifredi B-PER
's O
arrest O
precipitated O
things O
and O
within O
a O
few O
days O
the O
court B-ORG
in I-ORG
Trento I-ORG
declared O
the O
failure O
of O
Chini B-ORG
. O

A O
month O
later O
the O
Public O
Prosecutor B-ORG
asked O
for O
the O
arrests O
for O
Chini B-PER
and O
his O
son O
Gianluca B-PER
, O
investigated O
for O
fraudulent O
bankruptcy O
. O

Chini B-PER
subsequently O
decided O
to O
denounce O
Signifredi B-PER
. O

The O
accountant O
had O
to O
be O
the O
white O
knight O
called O
to O
save O
the O
Chini B-ORG
and O
, O
instead O
, O
it O
was O
the O
one O
who O
buried O
it O
. O

But O
the O
complaint O
for O
fraud O
is O
probably O
linked O
to O
a O
series O
of O
agreements O
that O
the O
two O
entrepreneurs O
had O
made O
. O

Chini B-PER
reproaches O
Signifredi B-PER
for O
not O
fulfilling O
his O
commitments O
, O
for O
having O
deceived O
him O
on O
the O
seriousness O
of O
his O
intentions O
. O

Chini B-PER
, O
in O
fact O
, O
has O
always O
argued O
that O
the O
company O
could O
safely O
avoid O
bankruptcy O
, O
since O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
the O
licenses O
of O
five O
malls O
that O
Chini B-ORG
had O
in O
mind O
to O
build O
in O
the O
Northeast O
would O
have O
arrived O
. O

It O
was O
business O
that O
would O
permanently O
cleanse O
the O
Chini B-ORG
coffers O
. O

Business O
that O
could O
not O
be O
concluded O
due O
to O
bankruptcy O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
the O
cure O
that O
tries O
to O
throw O
the O
sums O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
revenue O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
much O
lower O
than O
normal O
management O
. O

Chini B-PER
had O
left O
the O
task O
of O
managing O
these O
affairs O
to O
Signifredi B-PER
who O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
creditors O
and O
then O
give O
the O
company O
in O
turn O
to O
a O
building O
entrepreneur O
of O
Grosseto B-LOC
, O
Galeardi B-PER
. O

The O
arrest O
of O
the O
accountant O
, O
however O
, O
blew O
up O
everything O
. O

That O
's O
why O
Chini B-PER
felt O
deceived O
and O
decided O
to O
file O
a O
complaint O
. O

The O
entrepreneur O
feels O
the O
victim O
of O
a O
scam O
because O
in O
his O
view O
Signifredi B-PER
had O
at O
his O
disposal O
all O
the O
means O
to O
save O
the O
company O
. O

This O
would O
, O
of O
course O
, O
also O
safeguard O
the O
position O
of O
the O
same O
Chini B-PER
who O
subsequently O
ended O
up O
under O
house O
arrest O
and O
now O
finds O
himself O
still O
investigated O
together O
with O
his O
son O
with O
the O
charge O
of O
fraudulent O
bankruptcy O
. O

Chini B-PER
even O
risks O
losing O
the O
house O
, O
since O
it O
is O
registered O
to O
its O
former O
company O
and O
could O
now O
be O
sold O
to O
the O
auction O
by O
the O
curator O
. O

The O

annulled O

by O

two O
released O

Gianfranco B-PER

Fulvio B-PER
Trentini I-PER
were O
exonerated O
by O
the O
review B-ORG
court I-ORG
for O
the O

in O
the O
house O
Dusevich B-PER
. O

Trentini B-PER
, O
defended O
by O
lawyer O
Mario B-PER
Murgo I-PER
, O
so O
he O
could O
leave O
Vicenza B-LOC
prison O
to O
return O
to O
house O
arrest O
, O
while O
Spanish B-PER
is O
still O
in O
prison O
in O
Tolmezzo B-LOC
, O
accused O
of O
other O
crimes O
. O

The O
two O
are O
accused O
by O
the O
Carabinieri B-ORG
of O
having O
participated O
in O
the O
coup O
along O
with O
Walter B-PER
Zanetti I-PER
and O
Paul B-PER
John I-PER
Pallaoro I-PER
. O

According O
to O
what O
was O
contested O
by O
the O
Public O
Prosecutor B-ORG
's I-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
the O
two O
would O
only O
organize O
the O
coup O
, O
which O
would O
then O
be O
executed O
by O
the O
two O
accomplices O
, O
who O
were O
recognized O
by O
two O
persons O
. O

The O
organizational O
conduct O
would O
have O
taken O
place O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
places O
by O
the O
Trentini B-PER
who O
had O
carried O
out O
renovation O
work O
there O
. O

The O
witnesses O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
claimed O
that O
the O
two O
robbers O
moved O
inside O
their O
house O
with O
perfect O
knowledge O
of O
the O
places O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
they O
knew O
where O
the O
safe O
was O
. O

According O
to O
investigators O
Trentini B-PER
would O
have O
provided O
Spanish B-PER
with O
the O
information O
to O
complete O
the O
blow O
, O
but O
according O
to O
the O
judges O
of O
the O
review B-ORG
court I-ORG
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
this O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
judges O
observe O
that O
Trentini B-PER
remained O
in O
prison O
from O
1999 O
to O
2003 O
. O

Therefore O
he O
may O
not O
have O
participated O
in O
the O
renovation O
work O
in O
Dusevich B-PER
house O
in O
recent O
times O
. O

He O
himself O
told O
the O
gip O
that O
he O
had O
done O
those O
jobs O
in O
1992 O
. O

Given O
the O
time O
spent O
, O
the O
judges O
doubt O
that O
Trentini B-PER
can O
be O
the O
source O
of O
information O
so O
detailed O
that O
they O
allow O
the O
robbers O
to O
move O
perfectly O
at O
ease O
in O
the O
house O
Dusevich B-PER
. O

It O
is O
practically O
ready O
the O
expertise O
of O
geologist O
Paolo B-PER
Passardi I-PER
on O
the O
area O
north O
of O
the O
Sailing B-LOC
identified O
by O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
as O
possible O
seat O
of O
a O
large O
industrial O
center O
for O
the O
processing O
of O
inert O
waste O
and O
of O
activities O
of O
scraping O
and O
recovery O
of O
bulky O
waste O
. O

The O
professional O
delivered O
to O
the O
environmental B-ORG
service I-ORG
his O
work O
, O
which O
will O
only O
have O
to O
be O
supplemented O
by O
some O
details O
and O
some O
additional O
investigation O
. O

What O
emerges O
is O
the O
substantial O
feasibility O
of O
the O
project O
, O
with O
a O
number O
of O
technical O
requirements O
and O
measures O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
from O
the O
geological O
point O
of O
view O
- O
says O
Passardi B-PER
- O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
problem O
is O
always O
commensurate O
with O
the O
economic O
possibilities O
and O
it O
is O
true O
that O
everything O
or O
almost O
can O
be O
realized O
if O
you O
have O
the O
resources O
available O
. O

However O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
problems O
of O
that O
area O
, O
which O
also O
exist O
and O
need O
to O
be O
addressed O
, O
are O
contained O
in O
areas O
where O
one O
can O
operate O
. O

Of O
course O
it O
is O
not O
up O
to O
me O
to O
say O
if O
it O
is O
the O
best O
possible O
choice O
, O
from O
the O
technical O
point O
of O
view O
however O
I O
think O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
it O
is O
not O
ideal O
but O
not O
even O
the O
least O
indicated O
and O
that O
the O
planned O
interventions O
can O
be O
done O
. O

Passardi B-PER
tries O
to O
solve O
at O
the O
root O
the O
main O
problem O
, O
that O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
biotope O
of O
the O
Laghetti B-LOC
in O
the O
nearest O
part O
to O
the O
rocky O
wall O
. O

In O
order O
not O
to O
affect O
such O
a O
delicate O
environment O
launches O
the O
idea O
of O
moving O
the O
road O
, O
which O
now O
passes O
alongside O
, O
realizing O
it O
ex O
novo O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
plain O
, O
along O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
river O
Adige B-LOC
. O

In O
this O
way O
all O
the O
traffic O
, O
consisting O
of O
trucks O
loaded O
with O
garbage O
that O
make O
the O
shuttle O
with O
the O
landfill O
of O
Ischia B-LOC
Podetti I-LOC
but O
in O
the O
future O
also O
from O
the O
means O
directed O
to O
the O
companies O
of O
the O
pole O
of O
the O
destruction O
, O
would O
be O
distant O
from O
the O
biotope O
and O
the O
system O
of O
accesses O
to O
the O
various O
companies O
could O
be O
organized O
in O
a O
rational O
way O
along O
the O
river O
. O

The O
device O
would O
also O
make O
it O
possible O
to O
transform O
the O
current O
road O
into O
a O
bike O
path O
that O
would O
make O
the O
area O
of O
the O
biotope O
and O
the O
rock O
gym O
more O
enjoyable O
. O

But O
the O
delicate O
environmental O
balance O
of O
the O
Laghetti B-LOC
will O
still O
be O
in O
danger O
if O
you O
do O
not O
take O
other O
precautions O
too O
. O

Because O
beyond O
the O
humid O
zones O
the O
biotope O
is O
a O
delicate O
habitat O
, O
frequented O
among O
others O
by O
some O
species O
of O
birds O
of O
prey O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
to O
be O
very O
careful O
also O
to O
the O
acoustic O
impact O
of O
work O
activities O
and O
to O
the O
light O
pollution O
at O
night O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
machining O
will O
have O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
so O
as O
not O
to O
cause O
disturbance O
, O
therefore O
essentially O
inside O
sheds O
, O
and O
the O
external O
lighting O
will O
have O
to O
be O
subjected O
to O
limits O
and O
controls O
. O

One O
of O
the O
problems O
repeatedly O
reported O
and O
which O
concern O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
Sailing B-LOC
is O
the O
height O
of O
the O
flap O
, O
placed O
practically O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
country O
floor O
. O

Inevitably O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
work O
you O
will O
have O
to O
recharge O
the O
area O
with O
substantial O
carry O
- O
overs O
of O
land O
. O

But O
this O
is O
considered O
from O
the O
technical O
point O
of O
view O
one O
of O
the O
most O
easily O
solved O
and O
affordable O
problems O
, O
especially O
at O
a O
time O
like O
this O
of O
large O
enough O
material O
, O
seen O
for O
example O
the O
excavation O
of O
the O
tunnel O
under O
Martignano B-LOC
. O

Nor O
would O
it O
be O
a O
big O
problem O
to O
find O
hydraulic O
solutions O
to O
prevent O
the O
intervention O
from O
affecting O
, O
in O
cases O
of O
full O
, O
the O
inhabited O
area O
of O
the O
suburb O
. O

Some O
headaches O
could O
be O
caused O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
power O
line O
that O
crosses O
the O
area O
and O
that O
, O
given O
the O
current O
regulations O
and O
their O
bands O
of O
respect O
, O
will O
necessarily O
have O
to O
be O
moved O
, O
with O
everything O
it O
entails O
in O
terms O
of O
spending O
but O
especially O
of O
times O
. O

In O
short O
, O
there O
are O
problems O
but O
they O
seem O
to O
be O
solved O
. O

It O
is O
now O
up O
to O
the O
political O
party O
to O
decide O
whether O
the O
game O
is O
worth O
the O
candle O
. O

the O

In O
the O
aftermath O

all O

the O
circumscription B-ORG
council I-ORG
reiterated O
its O
position O
, O
giving O
unanimous O
negative O
opinion O
on O

hoping O
that O
this O
may O
in O
some O
way O
affect O
the O
environmental O
impact O
assessment O
to O
which O
it O
is O
currently O
subjected O
. O

They O
did O
not O
satisfy O
the O
circuit O
the O
words O
spoken O
during O
the O
public O
assembly O
on O
Monday O
by O
Grisenti B-PER
, O
who O
spoke O
of O
studies O
on O
traffic O
carried O
out O
by O
applying O
mathematical O
models O
, O
which O
would O
seem O
to O
ensure O
that O
, O
despite O
the O
new O
toll O
booth O
, O
a O
good O
percentage O
of O
traffic O
will O
flow O
on O
Via B-LOC
della I-LOC
Gottarda I-LOC
towards O
the O
new O
ring O
road O
of O
Mattarello B-LOC
. O

A O
solution O
which O
, O
regardless O
of O
the O
new O
exit O
, O
had O
been O
envisaged O
by O
the O
same O
district B-LOC
, O
but O
which O
now O
appears O
too O
little O
to O
remove O
the O
provincial O
road O
90 O
from O
the O
traffic O
that O
the O
tollgate O
would O
also O
bring O
. O

Scepticism O
also O
on O
the O
idea O
, O
expressed O
by O
Grisenti B-PER
, O
so O
the O
strap O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
tollgate O
will O
constitute O
a O
barrier O
for O
the O
expansion O
of O
the O
city O
towards O
the O
south O
. O

A O
forecast O
considered O
too O
optimistic O
. O

According O
to O
us O
- O
said O
President O
Armando B-PER
Versini I-PER
- O
the O
most O
appropriate O
solution O
would O
be O
to O
try O
to O
intercept O
traffic O
first O
, O
that O
is O
between O
Aldeno B-LOC
and O
Romagnano B-LOC
, O
with O
a O
road O
that O
diagonally O
cuts O
the O
countryside O
going O
to O
connect O
with O
the O
Mattarello B-LOC
bridge O
( O
and O
therefore O
with O
the O
natural O
access O
to O
the O
tollgate O
from O
the O
east O
) O
. O

The O
district B-LOC
was O
also O
asked O
to O
express O
its O
opinion O
on O
some O
requests O
for O

to O
the O

variant O
of O
the O

TRENTO B-LOC

Trentofrutta B-ORG

the O
16 O
years O
of O
life O
under O
the O

of O
the O

that O

, O
putting O

down O
by O
the O
Parmalat B-ORG
case O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O
net O
loss O
of O
Euros O
345,000 O
was O
largely O
due O
to O
the O
write O

Extraordinary O

Without O
this O

, O
the O

would O
have O
ended O

while O

rose O
from O

The O
decisive O
months O
will O
be O
those O
that O
are O
missing O
at O
the O

, O
since O
a O

between O

But O
this O
last O
glimpse O
of O
the O
year O
brought O
, O
after O
24 O

, O
a O

not O

with O
a O

The O

sent O
a O
letter O
to O

Alessandro B-PER

ask O

The O
CEO O
Luz B-PER
Philipp I-PER
, O
son O
of O
President O
Armin B-PER
( O
reconfirmed O
by O
the O
meeting O
last O
Friday O
) O
regretted O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
company O
lost O
24 O
months O
waiting O
for O
the O
answer O
, O
blocking O
the O

We O
're O
not O

I O
confirm O
that O
we O
will O
stay O

we O
do O
not O
intend O

To O
blow O
the O
possibility O
of O

of O
Trentofrutta B-ORG
was O
the O
lack O
of O
economic O
agreement O

The O
company O
, O
which O
specifies O
that O
it O
had O
received O
the O
offer O
to O
move O
and O
never O
asked O
for O
it O
, O
asked O
for O
a O
zero O
- O
cost O
barter O
: O

In O
other O
words O
, O
it O
would O
have O
moved O
only O
if O
the O
transfer O
burden O
would O
have O
been O
offset O
by O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
land O

including O
the O

which O
were O
deemed O
necessary O
to O
modernise O

Yesterday O

Jean O

Claude B-PER
Trichet I-PER

who O
summed O
up O
the O
concerns O

, O
stressing O
that O
the O
high O
oil O
prices O
had O
a O
visible O
direct O
impact O
on O
inflation O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
according O
to O
Trichet B-PER
, O
the O
effects O
have O
already O
been O
seen O
on O
the O
dynamics O
of O
consumer O
prices O
, O
which O
will O
hardly O
be O
able O

fall O

below O
2 O

However O
, O
the O
greatest O
concern O

the O
possibility O

indirect O
effects O

which O
until O
now O
have O
not O
been O
or O
have O
been O

In O

these O

is O
that O
things O
are O
unfortunately O
destined O
to O
get O
worse O
. O
" O

If O
we O
do O
n't O
wake O
up O
, O
in O
a O
few O
years O
we O
nail O
ourselves O
and O
we O
wo O
n't O
be O
saved O
works O
like O
the O
gallery O
of O
Martignano B-LOC
, O
which O
will O
only O
stop O
traffic O
a O
little O
further O
north O
, O
in O
Gardolo B-LOC
. O

Along O
the O
Valsugana O
the O
morning O
at O
6 O
a.m. O
there O
is O
already O
tail O
, O
sign O
that O
obviously O
there O
is O
something O
that O
does O
n't O
fit O
. O

So O
what O
do O
we O
do O
? O

The O
Green O
Councillor O
insists O
on O
an O
ad O
hoc O
figure O
, O
a O
mobility O
manager O
in O
charge O
of O
studying O
drastic O
measures O
to O
reduce O
traffic O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
things O
to O
do O
. O

We O
know O
that O
60 O
% O
of O
cars O
are O
made O
of O
commuters O
. O

Let O
's O
stop O
them O
! O

Let O
's O
try O
to O
close O
the O
hill O
roads O
to O
private O
vehicles O
. O

Let O
's O
do O
car O
pooling O
seriously O
. O

We O
give O
incentives O
to O
those O
who O
use O
the O
full O
car O
, O
we O
penalize O
those O
who O
travel O
alone O
. O

Let O
's O
do O
a O
real O
education O
: O

People O
have O
to O
understand O
that O
walking O
, O
busing O
or O
cycling O
is O
better O
now O
and O
that O
the O
car O
, O
which O
should O
not O
be O
demolished O
, O
should O
be O
treated O
as O
a O
means O
of O
transport O
. O

Pompermaier B-PER
as O
city O
councilman O
is O
disappointed O
for O
what O
little O
has O
been O
done O
in O
Trento B-LOC
from O
the O
structural O
and O
logistic O
point O
of O
view O
: O

It O
has O
been O
six O
years O
that O
we O
have O
been O
talking O
about O
parking O
lots O
and O
beyond O
the O
former O
Zuffo O
and O
via O
Monte O
Baldo O
there O
is O
nothing O
else O
. O

People O
must O
also O
be O
given O
alternatives O
, O
then O
they O
can O
hit O
hard O
those O
who O
do O
not O
exploit O
them O
. O

Also O
Iva B-PER
Berasi I-PER
, O
former O
provincial O
councillor O
for O
the O
environment O
, O
is O
convinced O
that O
more O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
: O

Gilmozzi B-PER
's O
plan O
is O
the O
continuation O
of O
what O
I O
had O
set O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
removing O
the O
most O
polluting O
means O
from O
circulation O
is O
the O
least O
that O
can O
be O
done O
but O
you O
must O
not O
stop O
there O
. O

The O
problem O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
is O
that O
this O
is O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
is O
not O
perceived O
by O
people O
and O
thus O
stalls O
. O

Instead O
it O
is O
a O
serious O
situation O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
health O
of O
children O
. O

It O
takes O
long O
- O
term O
planning O
to O
get O
the O
cars O
out O
of O
the O
cities O
, O
but O
that O
's O
what O
we O
've O
been O
saying O
for O
years O
, O
to O
the O
point O
that O
I O
'm O
getting O
annoyed O
to O
hear O
them O
from O
me O
too O
. O

The O
European B-LOC
Union I-LOC
, O
with O
its O
directives O
, O
is O
also O
trying O
to O
push O
states O
, O
regions O
and O
local O
authorities O
to O
do O
more O
. O

The O
limit O
on O
fine O
dusts O
is O
that O
50 O
micrograms O
can O
not O
be O
exceeded O
for O
more O
than O
35 O
times O
next O
year O
. O

This O
year O
in O
Trento B-LOC
we O
are O
already O
at O
44 O
passes O
, O
in O
Borgo B-LOC
Valsugana I-LOC
at O
50 O
. O

And O
if O
this O
happens O
again O
in O
2005 O
what O
will O
happen O
? O

Nothing O
. O

There O
are O
no O
sanctions O
but O
only O
an O
obligation O
to O
draw O
up O
recovery O
plans O
. O

That O
is O
what O
is O
already O
being O
done O
in O

In O

the O

chosen O
by O

an O

60,000 O

As O
already O
happened O
for O

Audi O

that O
Dellai B-PER
had O
previously O
, O
also O
for O
the O
new O
blazing O

was O
devised O
the O
ingenious O
trick O
of O

But O
the O

Dellai B-PER

is O
not O
the O
only O
sedan O
supplied O
to O

in O

There O
are O
twelve O

And O
for O
the O
city O

who O
remain O
without O

the O
Province B-LOC
has O
thought O
of O
a O
taxi O

which O
allows O
to O
cover O
any O
eventuality O

The O
most O
diligent O
in O
providing O
its O

with O
blue O

was O
the O
regional B-ORG

In O

there O
are O
three O

with O
three O

however O
, O
are O
the O

Adelino B-PER

they O

the O

the O

Dellai B-PER
, O
the'blue O

it O

therefore O
do O
not O
use O
that O

which O
thus O
remains O
to O
all O

But O
the O

although O
no O

Too O
many O
for O
an O

in O

, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
it O
has O
pushed O
to O
make O
a O

The O

Cimoli B-PER

understood O
that O
it O
was O
the O
last O
beach O

The O
other O
night O
, O
within O
an O

, O
we O
could O
move O

which O
is O
what O
we O
will O
all O
now O
work O
on O

Now O
- O
it O
has O
emphasized O

the O
important O
is O
that O
in O
the O
company O
they O
understand O
that O
you O
can O
no O
longer O
joke O
. O

We O
need O
to O
get O
the O

back O

get O
some O

The O
games O
are O
played O

And O
I O
think O
you O
can O
do O
it O
. O

Cimoli B-PER

aware O
that O
we O

have O
huge O

us O

those O
that O
will O
create O
our O
competitors O
. O

But O
we O
're O
in O
a O
free O

and O
it O
's O
right O
to O
fight O
it O

After O
the O

the O

that O
the O

now O
makes O
it O
possible O
to O
start O
the O
restructuring O

. O

Speaking O
of O
the O
integration O
fund O
for O
two O
years O
for O
the O
workers O
made O
redundant O
that O
will O
be O
paid O
by O
Alitalia B-ORG
, O
the O
minister O
reiterated O
that O
" O
there O
is O
no O
rescue O
with O
public O
money O
" O
and O
that O
" O
it O
will O
not O
happen O
" O
that O
the O

hire O
the O

even O
when O
the O

finished O
. O

" O
It O
is O
excluded O
" O
, O
he O
added O
. O

Putting O
into O
the O
fund O
integration O
is O
such O
an O
important O
number O
of O
people O
in O
a O
monopolist O
company O
that O
it O
had O
never O
been O
accustomed O
to O
suffer O
, O
that O
in O
the O
last O
12 O
years O
it O
has O
presented O
budgets O
of O
which O
11 O
passive O
and O
has O
always O
been O
recapitalized O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
- O
it O
has O
observed O
Cimoli B-PER
- O
and O
the O
solution O
gives O
a O
sense O
of O
tranquility O
. O

Satisfaction O
also O
by O
the O
government O
: O

For O
Vice O

Premier O
Fini B-PER
, O
the O
agreement O
is O
a O
success O
that O
shows O
the O
importance O
of O
social O

and O
Minister O

noted O
that O
common O

prevailed O

Minister O

said O
that O
" O
the O

" O
all O

, O
while O
for O
the O

after O
the O

" O
it O

of O
the O

the O

. O

The O

reiterated O
the O

made O
by O
the O

part O

therefore O
participate O

Are O
you O
okay O

No O
, O
because O
from O

that O
there O

some O

" O
We O
now O
want O
to O

the O

in O

we O
risk O

a O
common O

the O

to O

We O

at O

We O
therefore O
asked O

perhaps O
doing O

It O
is O

that O

not O
tolerate O
the O

not O

if O
an O

arrived O

we O

that O

of O
the O

It O
is O
precisely O
the O
members O
who O
could O
not O
buy O
the O
house O
because O
the O
ten O
years O
had O
not O
passed O

But O
one O
morning O
you O
wake O
up O

you O
realize O
that O
this O

just O
a O
dream O

Running O
after O

no O

your O

it O

your O

Everything O
takes O
on O
a O
clearer O

and O
you O
can O
live O
the O
favorite O

with O
serenity O

because O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
has O
always O
characterized O
your O
desire O

the O
disappointment O
for O

the O

the O
endless O

can O
be O
summed O
up O
in O
the O
incipit O
of O
a O
poem O
by O
Pedro B-PER

, O
a O
madrid O
poet O
of O
the O
last O
century O
: O
" O
Do O
not O
reject O

they O
are O

All O

be O
true O
if O
the O

You O

not O
a O

, O
your O

nothing O

But O
, O
you O
can O
say O
with O
certainty O
that O
you O
are O
not O
a O
worse O
man O
, O
and O
perhaps O
your O
passion O
is O
purer O
, O
because O
every O
time O
you O
wear O
boots O
and O
a O
shirt O
, O
entering O
the O
field O
, O
run O
and O
in O
the O
end O
you O
are O
exhausted O

but O
you O
return O

happy O
with O
a O
' O
primordial O
emotion O

With O

, O
the O

Later O
she O
was O
heard O
by O
the O
Carabinieri O
of O
Lavis B-LOC
, O
who O
tried O
to O
understand O
the O
reasons O
that O
prompted O
the O

to O
leave O

and O
not O
to O
return O
home O
even O
in O
the O
evening O

it O
was O
not O

the O

Originally O
the O
Egyptian O

spoken O
of O

then O
it O
was O
made O
way O

the O
hypothesis O
of O

The O

a O

The O

The O

As O
the O

Egypt B-LOC

The O
Israeli O
newspaper O
Haaretz B-ORG
on O
line O
, O
citing O
sources O

security O
, O
immediately O
gained O
the O
conviction O
that O
the O
Taba B-LOC

was O
to O
be O
attributed O
to O
a O
terrorist O
act O

days O

the O

the O

point O
out O

At O

I O
have O
always O
tried O
, O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
, O
to O
make O
the O
lesson O
more O
interesting O

For O

I O
use O

And O
if O
they O

how O

I O
prepare O

The O
new O
wave O
is O
very O
recent O
. O

These O
are O
some O
cases O
recorded O
in O
various O
departments O
. O

In O
one O
case O
, O
Legionella O
would O
also O
have O
caused O
the O
death O

The O
summit O
in O

dealt O
precisely O
with O
this O
case O
. O

The O
investigators O
decided O
to O
acquire O
all O
of O
the O
woman O
's O
medical O
records O
. O

The O
possibility O
of O
crime O
at O
this O
time O
is O
manslaughter O
. O

The O
file O
has O
been O
opened O
on O
behalf O
of O
identifiable O
persons O
, O
in O
essence O
at O
this O
time O
there O
are O
no O
investigations O
. O

This O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
situation O
is O
radically O
different O
from O
the O
past O
. O

The O
first O
investigation O
had O
started O
from O
nine O
deaths O
, O
although O
only O
five O
cases O
had O
overcome O
the O
rock O
of O
the O
evaluations O
. O

Now O
instead O
we O
are O
faced O
with O
a O
single O
death O
, O
moreover O
doubt O
as O
the O
woman O
had O
previously O
been O
hospitalized O
in O
Bologna B-LOC
and O
therefore O
there O
is O
no O
certainty O
that O
she O
has O
contracted O
the O
infection O
at O
Santa O
Chiara O
. O

It O
is O
not O
by O
chance O
that O
the O
file O
opened O
for O
the O
time O
being O
assumes O
only O
the O
crime O
of O
manslaughter O
. O

It O
would O
not O
stand O
at O
the O
moment O
a O
hypothesis O
of O
epidemic O
, O
not O
even O
a O
nosocomial O
epidemic O

Four O

In O

and O
seeing O
that O
the O

we O
have O
proposed O
a O

of O

In O

And O
in O

there O
is O
a O
system O

on O

by O
the O

that O

" O
The O
revenues O
from O
such O
a O
tax O
mechanism O
- O
said O
Tortoli B-PER
- O
would O
be O
appropriate O
insofar O
as O
they O
were O
used O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
financing O
interventions O
aimed O
at O
reducing O
air O
pollution O
in O
areas O
that O
are O
most O
critical O
" O
. O

In O
essence O
, O
it O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
introduce O
, O
according O
to O
Tortoli B-PER
, O
a O
differentiated O
taxation O
. O

The O
so O
- O
called O
Suv O
vehicles O
, O
i.e. O
the O
new O

, O
are O
in O
fact O
some O
but O
not O
the O
only O
vehicles O
that O
have O
on O
average O
high O
consumption O
, O
underlined O
the O
Undersecretary O
. O

To O
arrive O
at O
this O
taxation O
Tortoli B-PER
has O
highlighted O
the O
need O
for O
an O
accurate O

that O

In O
this O

, O
the O

, O
reported O
Tortoli B-PER
, O
" O

Having O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O

can O
be O
read O
as O
proof O
of O
the O
importance O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
gives O
to O

, O
the O
Councillor O
Cogo B-PER
admitted O
that O
the O
figure O
can O
also O
be O
indicative O
of O
a O
" O
expensive O
management O
" O
. O

The O
need O
to O
develop O
economies O
of O
scale O
is O
undoubtedly O
admitted O
with O
frankness O
by O
addressing O
the O
city O
councilors O
, O
the O
leaders O
of O

, O
and O
the O
directors O
of O

that O
crowded O

the O

the O
first O
of O

of O
the O
Euroregion B-LOC

Adige I-LOC
- O
Tyrol O
a O

. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
many O
European O
countries O
the O
tendency O
to O
entrust O
museums O
with O
tasks O
that O
go O
beyond O
the O
mere O
preservation O
of O
the O
collections O
, O
to O
embrace O
the O
wider O
field O
of O
the O
promotion O
of O

. O

And O
this O
requires O
territorial O
coordination O
and O
new O
management O
logics O
, O
system O
logics O
. O

From O
this O
awareness O
comes O
the O
meeting O
that O
the O
three O
leaders O
of O
culture O
on O
the O
Rovereto B-LOC
- O
Innsbruck B-LOC
axis O
thought O
to O
organize O

It O
must O
be O
said O
at O
once O
that O
both O
Zanon B-PER

, O
respectively O
for O

- I-LOC
Tirol I-LOC
, O
look O
very O
carefully O
at O
the O

In O
the O
long O

, O
Bolzano B-LOC
wants O

The O
ideas O

therefore O
, O
have O
not O
been O
lacking O
. O

As O
for O
the O

, O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
made O
it O
clear O
that O
the O

, O
certainly O
not O

in O
some O
ways O

" O

: O

The O

I O
mean O
, O
go O
ahead O
like O
this O
. O

Too O
bad O
this O
succinct O
statement O
follows O
by O
a O
few O
hours O
the O
publication O
of O
an O
interview O
with O
a O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
never O
so O
fierce O
. O

Yes O
, O
with O
so O
much O
warlike O
declarations O
for O
the O
respect O
of O
the O
programs O
and O
in O
defense O
of O
the O
" O
idea O
" O
that O
has O
the O
left O
of O
the O
institutional O
reform O
. O

The O
left B-ORG
- O
wing O
Democrats O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
are O
always O
able O
to O
amaze O
: O

as O
soon O
as O
you O
create O
a O
photograph O
of O
the O
Oak B-ORG
, O
this O
one O
dissolves O
. O

You O
think O
you O
have O
placed O
all O
the O
names O
in O
the O
different O
categories O
and O
- O
in O
a O
beating O
- O
the O
castle O
blows O
up O
. O

Really O
an O
endless O
rebus O
. O

But O
was O
n't O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
the O
" O
Follini B-PER
de O
noantri O
" O
who O
called O
for O
the O
respect O
of O
the O
programmes O
and O
advanced O
criticism O
of O
the O
institutional O
reform O
and O
the O
plan O
to O
reorder O
the O
research O
? O

No O
, O
it O
's O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
now O
. O

And O
was O
n't O
it O
the O
latter O
who O
led O
the O
party O
of O
the O
pro O
- O
governments O
, O
of O
the O
most O
faithful O
of O
the O
president O
willing O
to O
bow O
the O
head O
in O
order O
not O
to O
give O
up O
their O
velvety O
armchairs O
? O

No O
, O
nothing O
true O
. O

Now O
you O
remain O
waiting O
for O
new O
categories O
, O
new O
positions O
, O
additional O
roped O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
Quercia B-ORG
Congress O
has O
a O
lot O
to O
do O
with O
Trentino O
politics O
, O
although O
Mr O
Gigi B-PER
Olivieri I-PER
is O
right O
when O
he O
says O
that O
all O
in O
all O
we O
are O
a O
circle O
of O
1,000 O
members O
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
we O
have O
to O
look O
beyond O
the O
party O
. O

Yes O
, O
because O
many O
of O
the O
interventions O
of O
these O
days O
can O
be O
read O
as O
adjustments O
with O
a O
view O
to O
the O
renewal O
of O
the O
secretariat O
: O

If O
the O
Cogo B-PER
takes O
a O
stand O
against O
Dellai B-PER
, O
it O
is O
evident O
its O
concern O
to O
occupy O
the O
space O
of O
those O
who O
believe O
that O
the O
left O
is O
too O
flattened O
on O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
space O
now O
occupied O
by O
Andreolli B-PER
and O
Chiodi B-PER
. O

The O
most O
ironic O
these O
days O
seems O
to O
be O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
, O
who O
is O
getting O
some O
recognition O
: O

When O
I O
said O
the O
things O
that O
now O
sustains O
the O
Cogo B-PER
, O
I O
was O
passing O
through O
what O
wants O
to O
break O
everything O
. O

Patience O
. O

And O
what O
a O
regret O
- O
he O
smiled O
yesterday O
- O
to O
hear O
Dellai B-PER
want O
to O
give O
back O
centrality O
to O
politics O
and O
parties O
. O

Just O
now O
that O
I O
'm O
leaving O
, O
I O
almost O
get O
to O
think O
of O
another O
term O
of O
office O
. O

For O
Congress O
, O
games O
are O
n't O
made O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
candidacy O
of O
Andreolli B-PER
and O
Wanda B-PER
Chiodi I-PER
, O
some O
voices O
concern O
an O
appointment O
of O
guarantee O
to O
the O
role O
of O
secretary O
, O
to O
unite O
a O
party O
now O
divided O
. O

This O
solution O
could O
concern O
the O
current O
president O
of O

This O
is O
a O

by O

underlines O

in O

the O

the O

the O
phenomenon O
of O
the O

This O

a O

point O
in O
the O

not O

The O
mere O
fact O
of O

enough O

( O
Cernic B-PER

that O
the O
Itas B-ORG

still O

and O
the O
amazing O

between O
Ricardo B-PER

, O
matured O
in O
years O
of O
training O
with O
the O
national B-ORG

It O
is O
no O
coincidence O
that O
the O
most O
prolific O
Emilian O
player O
of O
these O
first O
two O
days O
was O
just O
the O

of O
Itumbiara B-LOC

that O
he O
will O
be O
the O

For O
these O
reasons O
the O
hosts O
will O
leave O
with O
the O
favors O
of O
the O
prediction O
, O
also O
because O
their O
seventh O
base O
is O
reduced O
in O
full O
( O
unique O
case O
in O
our O

) O
from O
the O

and O
therefore O
in O
terms O
of O
athletic O
condition O

still O
live O

A O
special O
game O
will O
also O
be O
, O
if O

for O
André B-PER

not O
only O
because O
he O
will O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
friends O
Ricardo B-PER
and O
Dante B-PER
, O
but O
also O
because O
Modena B-LOC
was O
the O
city O
in O
which O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
to O
play O
until O
a O
few O

" O
No O

he O
exclaims O
indispect O

It O
is O
not O

for O
a O

such O
as O
the O
Senate B-ORG
to O
examine O
our O
laws O
and O
determine O
whether O
they O
conflict O
with O
national O
interest O
. O

A O
concept O
which O
, O
moreover O
, O
is O
difficult O
to O
define O
. O

At O
the O
meeting O
of O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
with O
the O
representatives O
of O
the O
Regions O
under O
special O
statute O
( O
there O
was O
only O
the O
president O
of O

was O
also O

the O

" O
We O
appreciate O
Mr O
Calderoli B-PER
's O
openness O
and O
personal O
understanding O
, O
" O
said O
Dellai B-PER
. O

But O
it O
's O
not O
enough O
to O
say O
: O

I O
agree O
, O
it O
is O
the O
government O
that O
does O
not O
want O
. O

Because O
here O
we O
introduce O
radical O
changes O
to O
our O
constitutional O
system O
, O
and O
we O
go O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
it O
. O

President O
Dellai B-PER
, O
in O
short O
, O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
accepted O
only O
half O
a O
request O
out O
of O
four O
of O
those O
you O
have O
submitted O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
there O
was O
only O
half O
of O
the O
government O
's O
commitment O
to O
the O
first O
question O
. O

On O
the O
other O
three O
instead O
nothing O
. O

The O
minister O
repeated O
several O
times O
that O
he O
was O
not O
far O
from O
our O
approach O
, O
but O
then O
added O
: O

We O
must O
talk O
about O
this O
at O
the O
political O
summit O
of O
the O
majority O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
brought O
something O
home O
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
there O
is O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
government O
that O
institutional O
changes O
enter O
into O
force O
only O
if O
they O
involve O
more O
autonomy O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
. O

All O
this O
is O
subject O
to O
national O
interest O
. O

If O
the O
government O
finds O
that O
a O
provincial O
law O
harms O
this O
interest O
it O
no O
longer O
sends O
it O
to O
the O
Court B-ORG
, O
but O
to O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
which O
is O
a O
political O
body O
, O
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
can O
cancel O
it O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
this O
is O
unacceptable O
for O
us O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
minister O
means O
that O
even O
Trentino B-LOC
must O
remember O
that O
he O
is O
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O

The O
concept O
of O
national O
interest O
is O
dangerous O
, O
because O
it O
is O
not O
defined O
. O

It O
is O
so O
vague O
that O
, O
of O
course O
, O
being O
at O
the O
discretion O
of O
political O
bodies O
, O
it O
lends O
itself O
to O
possible O
forcing O
. O

Even O
more O
serious O
is O
the O
possibility O
for O
Parliament B-ORG
to O
decide O
on O
the O
amendment O
of O
our O
Statute O
of O
autonomy O
, O
without O
agreement O
with O
us O
. O

The O
Minister O
, O
while O
personally O
in O
favour O
, O
said O
that O
the O
majority O
are O
against O
. O

Calderoli B-PER
also O
rejected O
our O
request O
that O
there O
be O
no O
contextual O
elections O
. O

Do O
you O
fear O
that O
the O
legislature O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
will O
become O
so O
three O
years O
? O

We O
can O
not O
accept O
that O
the O
Head O
of O
State O
may O
dissolve O
the O
Regional B-ORG
Council I-ORG
. O

On O
this O
issue O
too O
, O
Calderoli B-PER
made O
no O
commitments O
, O
referring O
the O
matter O
back O
to O
the O
political O
table O
. O

We O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O
issue O
be O
defined O
by O
means O
of O
rules O
implementing O
the O
Statute O
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
agreement O
, O
it O
could O
be O
the O
most O
appropriate O
way O
. O

Ministers O
were O
interested O
, O
but O
it O
can O
not O
be O
said O
that O
an O
agreement O
has O
been O
reached O
. O

In O
short O
, O
negative O
balance O
. O

More O
than O
negative O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
heavily O
negative O
. O

Even O
on O
the O
point O
of O
peer O
representation O
in O
the O
new O
Senate B-ORG
the O
minister O
did O
not O
give O
assurances O
. O

He O
said O
that O
he O
is O
working O
on O
a O
new O
proposal O
for O
the O
configuration O
of O
the O
Senate B-ORG
in O
which O
he O
plans O
to O
strengthen O
the O
representatives O
of O
the O
territories O
. O

We O
will O
evaluate O
it O
when O
it O
is O
presented O

Bertoldi B-PER
, O
when O
did O
you O
hear O
Torretta B-PER
and O
Pari B-PER
? O

With O
Torretta B-PER
we O
met O
in O
late O
April O
, O
while O
with O
Pari B-PER
we O
felt O
via O
chat O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
. O

Did O
it O
seem O
to O
you O
that O
they O
feared O
for O
their O
safety O
? O

They O
told O
me O
that O
in O
view O
of O
Italy B-LOC
the O
situation O
seemed O
more O
serious O
than O
it O
really O
was O
. O

What O
can O
civil O
volunteers O
do O
to O
work O
with O
a O
minimum O
security O
guarantee O
? O

I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
precautions O
are O
the O
usual O
ones O
: O

keep O
a O
low O
profile O
, O
do O
not O
turn O
with O
weapons O
or O
with O
supplies O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
you O
have O
to O
have O
an O
attitude O
of O
contact O
with O
people O
. O

It O
conveys O
confidence O
, O
closeness O
to O
their O
problems O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
form O
of O
security O
. O

The O
new O
element O
in O
the O
kidnapping O
of O
the O
two O
Italian O
girls O
is O
that O
for O
the O
first O
time O
they O
were O
targeted O
by O
volunteers O
belonging O
to O
non O
- O
governmental O
forces O
, O
those O
who O
live O
in O
closer O
contact O
with O
the O
people O
. O

It O
's O
actually O
hard O
to O
understand O
. O

That O
leaves O
me O
amazed O
. O

When O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
, O
a O
rocket O
fell O
in O
the O
courtyard O
next O
to O
the O
headquarters O
of O
A B-ORG
bridge I-ORG
for I-ORG
" O
the O
fact O
made O
me O
a O
bit O
puzzled O
, O
but O
I O
was O
reassured O
that O
it O
was O
a O
" O
normal O
" O
shooting O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
though O
, O
perhaps O
my O
feelings O
were O
not O
entirely O
out O
of O
place O
. O

Where O
did O
your O
perplexity O
come O
from O
? O

For O
a O
year O
our O
work O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
went O
well O
. O

But O
since O
March O
of O
this O
year O
, O
with O
the O
uprising O
of O
Al B-PER
Sadr I-PER
in O
Falluja B-LOC
the O
situation O
has O
degenerated O
. O

Before O
there O
was O
the O
resistance O
of O
Islamic O
matrix O
, O
but O
it O
took O
little O
because O
perceived O
by O
the O
population O
as O
a O
religious O
thing O
and O
carried O
from O
outside O
, O
and O
that O
linked O
to O
the O
old O
regime O
. O

These O
are O
organized O
structures O
that O
operate O
through O
heavy O
actions O
, O
but O
they O
knew O
where O
and O
how O
to O
hit O
. O

They O
know O
everything O
and O
everyone O
and O
have O
never O
attacked O
the O
NGOs O
, O
especially O
those O
recognized O
as O
not O
compromised O
with O
the O
occupants O
. O

Why O
, O
then O
the O
two O
Italian O
girls O
were O
kidnapped O
? O

My O
first O
assumption O
was O
that O
they O
were O
not O
organized O
thugs O
, O
but O
a O
gang O
of O
thugs O
. O

Sure O
, O
though O
, O
that O
from O
what O
I O
learn O
from O
the O
internet O
comes O
the O
possibility O
that O
it O
was O
just O
a O
targeted O
attack O
against O
us O
. O

Why O
strike O
an O
organization O
that O
, O
beyond O
any O
ideology O
and O
flag O
, O
is O
committed O
to O
trying O
to O
give O
relief O
to O
the O
population O
? O

Probably O
to O
increase O
the O
emotional O
effect O
of O
their O
action O
. O

Hitting O
an O
NGO O
means O
launching O
the O
message O
that O
danger O
is O
global O
. O

I O
would O
not O
exclude O
, O
however O
, O
the O
first O
possibility O
. O

Is O
there O
a O
feeling O
of O
displeasure O
with O
foreigners O
among O
the O
population O
? O

Until O
last O
January O
, O
when O
I O
left O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
I O
would O
say O
no O
. O

But O
that O
was O
a O
century O
ago O
. O

Then O
what O
happened O
? O

From O
March O
the O
situation O
has O
changed O
and O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
degenerates O
from O
day O
to O
day O
. O

Addresses O
, O
attacks O
, O
kidnappings O
happen O
daily O
. O

If O
employment O
was O
accepted O
first O
in O
exchange O
for O
the O
liberation O
from O
Saddam B-PER
, O
then O
a O
new O
event O
took O
place O
, O
determined O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
winners O
of O
the O
old O
regime O
failed O
to O
guarantee O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
population O
and O
even O
a O
minimum O
of O
services O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
there O
's O
no O
more O
Saddam B-PER
, O
but O
people O
still O
have O
a O
hell O
of O
a O
life O
. O

This O
summer O
, O
with O
the O
infernal O
heat O
of O
Baghdad B-LOC
, O
there O
was O
no O
water O
and O
light O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
saying O
that O
the O
Iraqis O
support O
the O
rebels O
, O
but O
of O
course O
something O
has O
changed O
. O

But O
does O
n't O
anyone O
distinguish O
between O
soldiers O
and O
civilians O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
primary O
objective O
is O
always O
the O
American O
troops O
. O

The O
distinction O
then O
there O
is O
also O
between O
military O
and O
civilian O
, O
between O
NGOs O
volunteers O
and O
members O
of O
the O
administrative O
offices O
, O
between O
Americans O
and O
others O
. O

... O

Yet O
in O
the O

which O

The O
trade O

expressed O
doubts O
about O
the O
lack O

of O
a O
law O
that O
emphasizes O
the O
rationalization O

of O

of O
the O

, O
equating O
them O
in O

It O
is O
feared O
that O

will O
fail O
to O
the O

that O
the O
quality O
of O

to O

will O

. O

Ipab B-ORG
staff O
, O
who O
are O
already O
insufficient O

under O
excessive O
working O

, O
would O
also O
change O
the O
legal O
regime O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
an O
autonomous O
, O
private O
sector O
is O
envisaged O
, O
while O
these O
workers O
are O
now O
included O
in O
the O
local O
government O
bargaining O
sector O
. O

The O
fear O
is O
that O
this O
may O
lead O
in O
the O
future O
to O
a O
reduction O
in O
wages O
already O
considered O
too O
low O
today O
. O

Another O
controversial O
aspect O
concerns O
the O
position O
of O
the O
directors O
and O
managers O
of O
the O
Houses O
of O
Rest O
, O
today O
employees O
with O
an O
indefinite O
contract O
, O
who O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
their O
work O
should O
go O
on O
waiting O
, O
in O
order O
to O
have O
a O
private O
assignment O
linked O
to O
the O
board B-ORG
of I-ORG
directors I-ORG
. O

If O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
- O
the O
unions O
say O
- O
we O
will O
mobilize O
the O
staff O
, O
not O
excluding O
a O
demonstration O

in O

is O
a O
touching O

lucid O
film O

tells O
the O
true O
story O
of O
Ramon B-PER
Sampedro I-PER
, O
a O
tetraplegic O
forced O
to O

one O
of O
the O
best O

A O

enough O
to O
Bardem B-PER
to O
open O

to O
arouse O
avalanches O

the O

to O

More O
than O
on O

PREMISSION O

The O
need O
to O
renew O
the O
organization O
of O
the O
Trentino B-ORG

starts O
from O
the O
desire O
of O
the O
Board O
of O

, O
the O

of O
the O

, O
to O
adapt O

improve O
the O

rendered O
by O
Via B-ORG
Segantini I-ORG
to O
the O
almost O
600 O

. O

THE O
METHOD O

To O
oversee O
the O
path O
will O
be O
the O
cda O
of O
Via B-ORG
Segantini I-ORG
that O
, O
in O

to O
the O
input O
, O
will O
verify O
and O
approve O
the O
three O
- O

program O
of O
improvement O
that O
will O
arise O
from O
three O
phases O
. O

The O
first O
is O
that O
of O
listening O
to O
the O
internal O
structure O
at O
via B-ORG
Segantini I-ORG
, O
and O
external O
( O
cooperatives O
, O
consortia O
but O
also O
actors O
of O
the O
Trentino O
society O
) O
. O

The O
second O
is O
that O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
that O
will O
lead O
to O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
real O
program O
. O

The O
third O
is O
monitoring O
and O
verification O
. O

of O
the O

For O
that O

In O
An B-ORG

the O
strong O
concern O
about O
the O
measure O

that O
the O

Domenico B-PER

is O
preparing O
to O
discuss O
with O
the O
parties O
of O
the O

The O
point O
is O
that O
we O
still O
do O
not O
know O
how O
many O
resources O
will O
be O
available O
: O

For O
the O
time O

, O
only O
EUR O
6 O

certain O
, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
barely O
enough O
to O
cover O

on O

Berlusconi B-PER

) O
would O
remain O
little O
or O
nothing O
. O

The O
idea O
of O
some O
members O
of O
An B-ORG
, O
such O
as O
Mario B-PER
Baldassarri I-PER
and O
Pietro B-PER
Armani I-PER
, O
is O
that O
the O

Okay O

I O
'll O
tell O
you O
why O
: O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
lose O
the O
thread O
. O

I O
run O
: O

I O
can O
do O
that O
. O

If O
I O
've O
come O
this O
far O
, O
it O
's O
just O
because O
I O
can O
run O
and O
I O
never O
have O
to O
forget O
it O
. O

If O
I O
lost O
the O
compass O
, O
the O
next O
marathon O
would O
be O
all O
over O
already O
. O

Everything O
is O
catastrophic O
... O

It O
's O
not O
that O
. O

I O
am O
pleased O
, O
of O
course O
, O
with O
the O
attention O
of O
some O
companies O
. O

It O
has O
not O
materialized O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
am O
happy O
. O

Seriously O
. O

And O
there O
may O
be O
something O
on O
TV O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
anything O
... O

It O
's O
a O
surprise O
. O

But O
dead O
there O
: O

are O
parentheses O
, O
pleasant O
as O
much O
as O
you O
want O
, O
but O
they O
will O
remain O
parentheses O
. O

Blond O
and O
shy O
, O
Stefano B-PER
Baldini I-PER
has O
the O
open O
smile O
of O
a O
pure O
guy O
. O

It O
's O
in O
a O
suit O
. O

At O
Frankfurt B-LOC
Airport O
, O
returning O
from O
Africa B-LOC
, O
they O
lost O
their O
luggage O
but O
did O
not O
want O
to O
waste O
time O
. O

In O
Trento B-LOC
they O
were O
waiting O
for O
him O
at O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
Giro O
al O
Sas O
and O
he O
is O
not O
the O
type O
to O
miss O
the O
commitments O
. O

Look O
! O

That O
's O
nice O
... O

The O
last O
minutes O
of O
my O
Olympic O
competition O
... O

Here O
I O
began O
to O
realize O
that O
I O
was O
going O
to O
make O
it O
... O

The O
sunset O
gave O
a O
special O
touch O
... O

And O
then O
we O
went O
from O
the O
darkness O
of O
one O
last O
street O
, O
to O
the O
very O
strong O
light O
of O
the O
Panathinaiko O
stadium O
. O

I O
'm O
still O
excited O

And O
when O
I O

I O

were O

with O
that O

you O

I O
am O
ahead O
: O

I O
went O
11 O
times O
under O
2 O
hours O
and O
10 O
hours O
and O
my O
3 O
best O
times O
are O
all O
better O
than O
his O

Have O
you O
decided O
which O
marathon O
to O
run O
in O
the O
spring O
? O

" O
Boston B-LOC
, O
London B-LOC

I O
do O

goal O

, O

it O
would O
be O
fine O
to O
even O

up O

The O
Helsinki B-LOC
route O
is O
a O
bit O
less O
demanding O
than O
that O
of O
Athens B-LOC

there O
will O

such O

a O

race O

Anyway O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
about O
it O
right O
now O
: O

After O
the O
Tour O
at O
the O

I O
'll O
close O
the O
gate O
for O
a O
while O

go O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
just O
as O
a O
guest O
this O
time O
. O

And O
I O
'll O
enjoy O
the O
city O
. O

Think O
about O
the O
Beijing B-LOC
Olympics O
? O

I O
see O
them O
very O
far O
away O
... O

Then O
4 O
years O
go O
by O
in O
a O
flash O
, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
about O
it O
. O

Will O
you O
be O
there O
that O
day O
? O

I O
tried O
the O
pressure O
and O
the O
tension O
to O
leave O
to O
look O
for O
the O
gold O
... O

Now O
I O
want O
to O
try O
the O
tension O
of O
starting O
from O
reigning O
sample O

Yeah O
, O
I O
'll O
be O
there O

He O
kept O

And O
I O
knew O
that O
when O
I O
was O
on O
the O

in O
Athens B-LOC

I O
knew O
it O
was O
important O
to O

" O

And O
I O
was O
proud O
and O
composed O
and O
wanted O
to O
sing O

I O
knew O
it O

of O

of O

If O

Apart O

I O
have O
to O
thank O

In O
Bolzano B-LOC
there O
is O
nothing O
else O
, O
it O
is O
the O
theme O
of O
the O
day O
: O

Two O
Muslim O
women O
were O
forbidden O
to O
bathe O
fully O
dressed O
in O
a O
swimming O
pool O
of O
the O
always O
crowded O
city O
lido O
. O

The O
fact O
occurred O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
. O

The O
two O
women O
had O
arrived O
at O
the O
Lido O
with O
a O
man O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
children O
. O

While O
men O
and O
children O
put O
themselves O
in O
costumes O
, O
the O
two O
women O
remained O
dressed O
from O
head O
to O
toe O
with O
long O
tunics O
. O

And O
in O
this O
way O
they O
also O
tried O
to O
get O
into O
the O
pool O
. O

There O
was O
the O
protest O
of O
some O
bather O
, O
for O
hygienic O
reasons O
, O
and O
the O
two O
women O
were O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
bathtub O

does O
not O
make O

a O
drama O
. O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
you O
have O
to O
respect O
the O
rules O
and O
if O
you O
ca O
n't O
enter O
the O
pool O
clothes O
, O
then O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
do O
it O
. O

For O
him O
, O
wanting O
to O
allow O
Muslim O
women O
to O
respect O
their O
religious O
dictates O
, O
another O
solution O
would O
be O
there O
. O

In O
Muslim O
countries O
there O
are O
mixed O
pools O
, O
but O
also O
pools O
reserved O
only O
for O
men O
and O
only O
for O
women O
. O

If O
even O
in O
Italy B-LOC
you O
can O
introduce O
this O
system O
, O
why O
not O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
aware O
, O
it O
would O
n't O
be O
against O
the O
law O
. O

But O
if O
the O
private O
pools O
were O
not O
built O
, O
then O
my O
advice O
is O
not O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Lido O
, O
he O
concluded O

Luisa B-PER
Gnecchi I-PER
, O
Ds B-ORG
, O
vice O
- O
president O
of O
the O
South O
Tyrolean O
junta O
and O
councillor O
for O
immigration O
as O
well O
as O
equal O
opposition O
, O
does O
not O
see O
too O
many O
problems O
in O
the O
matter O
. O

The O
issue O
has O
two O
aspects O
: O

one O
cultural O
and O
the O
other O
hygienic O
. O

For O
that O
cultural O
- O
he O
said O
- O
I O
remember O
that O
our O
grandmothers O
went O
to O
the O
sea O
completely O
covered O
from O
head O
down O
, O
with O
absolutely O
whole O
costumes O
. O

Swimsuits O
have O
become O
smaller O
and O
smaller O
. O

As O
for O
the O
hygienic O
aspect O
it O
is O
enough O
to O
predict O
in O
the O
bathrooms O
of O
the O
sinks O
where O
to O
wash O
these O
costumes O
, O
these O
tunics O
, O
before O
entering O
the O
water O
. O

Before O
entering O
the O
pool O
you O
should O
rightly O
take O
a O
shower O
. O

But O
sometimes O
it O
's O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
filters O
. O

Until O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
headphone O
was O
mandatory O
. O

The O
mayor O
of O
Bolzano B-LOC
Giovanni B-PER
Salghetti I-PER
said O
he O
was O
puzzled O
about O
the O
decision O
to O
get O
women O
out O
of O
the O
bathtub O
. O

I O
saw O
women O
bathe O
dressed O
also O
at O
the O
Lido O
of O
Venice O
and O
there O
were O
no O
problems O
. O

If O
there O
were O
no O
questions O
of O
a O
hygienic O
nature O
in O
principle O
I O
would O
be O
in O
order O
not O
to O
introduce O
such O
prohibitions O
. O

, O
the O
provincial B-ORG

leaders O
spoke O
of O
two O
new O
buildings O
for O
the O

groups O
. O

The O
hypothesis O
of O
obtaining O
offices O
in O
the O
palace O
of O
the O
Region O
, O
for O
reasons O
above O
all O
of O
opportunity O
- O
it O
would O
seem O
a O
jackal O
of O
an O
institution O
in O

- O

point O

are O

to O
the O
seat O
of O
the O
provincial B-ORG

, O
Palazzo O
Trentini O
in O
via B-LOC
Manci I-LOC
. O

The O
small O
commission O
charged O
by O
the O
advisors O
to O
find O
the O
offices O
, O
composed O
of O
Nerio B-PER
Giovanazzi I-PER
( O

, O
Marcello B-PER
Carli I-PER
( O
Udc B-ORG

and O
Giorgio B-PER
Casagranda I-PER
( O
Margherita B-ORG
) O
, O
after O
having O
been O
discarded O
the O
restored O
palace O
on O
Aconcio B-LOC
street I-LOC
, O
has O
aimed O
at O
these O
two O
offices O
because O
they O
would O
allow O
to O
join O
the O
groups O
, O
today O
scattered O
in O
various O
buildings O
of O
the O
city O
. O

The O
problem O
remains O
that O
the O
Province B-LOC
instead O
of O
using O
one O
of O

the O

, O
certainly O
not O
a O
significant O

, O
which O
also O
affects O

But O
Saronni B-PER
really O
does O
n't O
like O
this O
policy O
: O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
lion O

side O

from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O

then O

just O
the O
" O
Bici B-ORG
club I-ORG
Azzurro I-ORG

" O
of O
the O
historical O
rival O
of O
Francesco B-PER
Moser I-PER
( O
which O
today O
has O
been O
officially O
welcomed O
by O
the O
Uci B-ORG
in O
the O
Pro O
Tour O
circuit O
along O
with O
the O
other O
three O
Italian O

the O

. O

Although O
looking O
at O
the O
technical O
skill O
of O
Lampre B-ORG
and O
Saeco B-ORG
, O
the O
imbalance O
in O
favor O
of O
men O
in O
red O
would O
also O
appear O
justified O
, O
so O
it O
is O
normal O
for O
men O
to O
have O
a O
certain O
reluctance O
to O
accept O
this O
subdivision O
. O

It O
will O
therefore O
be O
necessary O
to O
wait O
until O
the O
two O
parties O
regain O
harmony O
, O
before O
seeing O
what O
fate O
will O
await O

the O

he O

Was O
Renato B-PER
Curcio I-PER
there O
? O

" O
Curcio B-PER
remained O
little O
with O
us O
" O
: O

he O
left O
in O
the O
late O
spring O
of O
the O
70 O
's O
. O

Do O
you O
deny O
anything O
about O
those O
years O
? O

- O
No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
deny O
anything O
. O

Maybe O
some O
second O
thoughts O
. O

Some O
choices O
today O
I O
would O
n't O
make O
them O
anymore O
. O

Like O
what O
? O

It O
's O
like O
leaving O
in O
the O
morning O
at O
5 O
o'clock O
to O
make O
leaflets O
in O
front O
of O
the O
factories O
, O
and O
going O
to O
bed O
48 O
or O
72 O
hours O
later O
. O

Have O
you O
ever O
used O
violence O
? O

" O
No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
've O
ever O
used O
violence O
. O

Unless O
by O
violence O
we O
mean O
that O
verbal O
, O
when O
we O
shouted O
at O
the O
marches O
: O
" O
Fascists O
, O
bourgeois O
, O
still O
a O
few O
months O
" O
. O

That O
kind O
of O
violence O
, O
yes O
, O
we O
used O
it O
. O

Did O
he O
regret O
it O
? O

" O
No O
, O
" O
because O
words O
then O
have O
a O
meaning O
in O
history O
. O

There O
they O
had O
a O
certain O
value O
. O

It O
was O
a O
time O
when O
certain O
civil O
conquests O
still O
had O
to O
be O
made O
, O
when O
well O
- O
being O
was O
still O
distant O
. O

Fighting O
with O
these O
words O
, O
even O
if O
hard O
, O
seemed O
to O
me O
to O
be O
a O
right O
thing O
. O

Something O
that O
could O
be O
endured O
. O

Today O
you O
are O
a O
rich O
man O
, O
important O
, O
vice O
president O
of O
the O
Confesercenti B-ORG
and O
leading O
man O
of O
the O
Chamber B-ORG
of I-ORG
Commerce I-ORG
. O

A O
beautiful O
conversion O
, O
compared O
to O
when O
he O
sang O
: O
" O
We O
are O
workers O
, O
comrades O
, O
laborers O
" O
. O

Do O
you O
feel O
a O
turncoat O
? O

Thirty O
- O
seven O
years O
after O
that O
, O
what O
am O
I O
supposed O
to O
be O
? O

Still O
a O
protester O
? O

A O
global O
no O
? O

Of O
course O
I O
've O
been O
a O
different O
person O
since O
then O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
turncoat O
. O

In O
my O
life O
I O
have O
a O
tension O
that O
brings O
me O
back O
to O
my O
past O
all O
the O
time O
. O

An O
example O
: O

In O
my O
studio O
I O
have O
eleven O
people O
working O
, O
and O
they O
're O
all O
hired O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
even O
have O
a O
co.co.co O
, O
when O
other O
studies O
do O
n't O
hire O
anyone O
. O

Because O
I O
believe O
in O
certain O
values O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
consistency O
is O
a O
virtue O
? O

No O
, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
called O
a O
virtue O
. O

People O
have O
the O
right O
to O
change O
their O
thoughts O
if O
they O
convince O
themselves O
that O
there O
is O
something O
different O
and O
better O
. O

Coherence O
is O
a O
virtue O
, O
if O
you O
are O
inconsistent O
in O
your O
interest O
. O

Why O
is O
it O
that O
almost O
thirty O
years O
after O
its O
dissolution O
Struggle B-ORG
continues O
to O
be O
a O
powerful O
lobby O
, O
which O
always O
shoots O
in O
defense O
of O
its O
members O
? O

There O
is O
a O
link O
between O
us O
that O
we O
have O
passed O
this O
experience O
, O
which O
has O
no O
end O
. O

There O
are O
experiences O
, O
especially O
of O
a O
certain O
period O
of O
life O
, O
that O
remain O
imprinted O
in O
the O
blood O
. O

Let O
's O
think O
about O
what O
the O
DC B-ORG
has O
been O
for O
many O
, O
which O
unites O
even O
those O
who O
today O
make O
different O
political O
choices O
. O

But O
it O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
those O
of O
Fight B-ORG
continue I-ORG
have O
made O
all O
( O
or O
almost O
) O
career O
: O

in O
newspapers O
, O
in O
politics O
, O
in O
publishing O
, O
at O
university O
. O

Not O
all O
of O
them O
, O
some O
of O
them O
. O

But O
it O
's O
natural O
that O
students O
thirty O
years O
ago O
, O
today O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
society O
. O

What O
should O
I O
say O
, O
then O
, O
of O
Communion B-ORG
and I-ORG

The O

an O
act O

Does O
n't O
writing O
these O
things O
mean O
you O
're O
a O
little O
morally O
responsible O

It O
was O
a O
barbarism O
of O

even O
if O

This O

one O
of O

things O
I O

Is O
there O

It O

he O
is O

very O
high O

you O
of O

- O
You O
do O

It O
is O
a O
dark O
story O
of O
those O
years O

where O

moment O

One O
of O
these O
was O
the O
story O
of O
the O
death O
of O
Alceste B-PER

It O
may O
have O
been O
a O
reckoning O

She O
has O
always O
had O
great O
familiarity O
with O

. O

Since O
the O
time O
of O
the O
fight B-ORG
Continue I-ORG
she O
kept O
the O
cash O
register O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
that O
she O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

Where O
did O
he O
get O
it O
? O

The O
money O
was O
given O
by O
young O
people O
, O
workers O
, O
teachers O
. O

I O
picked O
up O
. O

We O
had O
a O
lot O

We O

hundreds O

for O

there O
were O

who O
always O
helped O

In O

Who O
is O
Marco B-PER

to O
you O
? O

A O
great O
political O

? O

A O
pure O

one O
who O

loves O

? O

A O
chameleon O

An O
opportunist O
who O
is O
where O

Marco B-PER
Boato I-PER
is O
a O
great O

He O
is O
one O
who O
spends O
himself O
on O

demonstrating O
his O
good O
and O

If O

were O

he O
would O
already O
have O

Marco B-PER
Boato I-PER

It O
no O
longer O
has O
the O
transport O

but O
has O
the O
wisdom O
of O
a O
great O
ideality O
. O

Marco B-PER
Boato I-PER
's O
only O
fault O
is O
that O
he O
is O
not O
able O
to O
drink O
a O
glass O

in O
a O

And O
that O

am O
in O

" O
explains O
Pompermaier O

" O
because O
I O
appreciate O

All O
to O
have O
nothing O
, O
since O
he O
is O
now O
a O
tenant O
of O
Itea B-ORG
. O

The O
agency O
bought O
its O
apartment O
in O
2002 O
, O
when O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
cover O
the O
14 O
billion O
lire O
hole O
that O
had O
opened O
in O
the O
CSC B-ORG
accounts O
. O

I O
learned O
that O
the O
house O
was O
for O
sale O
in O
early O
' O
96 O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
30 O
years O
old O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
money O
to O
buy O
the O
house O
. O

They O
were O
enough O
for O
the O
advance O
and O
that O
's O
why O
I O
chose O
to O
buy O
from O
a O
cooperative O
. O

Then O
I O
liked O
the O
house O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
saw O
it O
. O

You O
call O
it O
love O
at O
first O
sight O
. O

It O
is O
an O
attic O
of O
68 O
square O
meters O
and O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
it O
in O
advance O
as O
well O
as O
a O
fixed O
monthly O
installment O
of O
629 O
thousand O
lire O
for O
fifteen O
years O
. O

I O
did O
my O
math O
and O
thought O
I O
could O
stay O
in O
it O
. O

So O
I O
decided O
to O
buy O
. O

Here O
began O
the O
first O
problems O
because O
when O
I O
asked O
when O
the O
house O
would O
become O
mine O
they O
became O
vague O
. O

They O
told O
me O
that O
after O
the O
fifteen O
years O
there O
would O
definitely O
be O
something O
to O
pay O
, O
but O
that O
the O
Province B-LOC
would O
intervene O
politically O
and O
that O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
balance O
would O
not O
be O
excessive O
. O

I O
entered O
the O
apartment O
in O
July O
1996 O
. O

Already O
the O
following O
month O
we O
were O
talking O
about O
debts O
contracted O
to O
build O
the O
palace O
where O
I O
lived O
. O

At O
first O
, O
however O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
few O
million O
. O

We O
went O
on O
like O
this O
, O
in O
uncertainty O
, O
until O
December O
' O
96 O
. O

It O
was O
at O
that O
point O
that O
the O
CSC B-ORG
leaders O
told O
us O
that O
the O
debts O
looming O
over O
my O
palace O
amounted O
to O
$ O
800 O
million O
. O

Throughout O
the O
building O
there O
are O
18 O
apartments O
, O
so O
the O
debt O
to O
each O
of O
us O
amounted O
to O
about O
40 O
million O
lire O
. O

Money O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
more O
than O
what O
we O
paid O
until O
then O
. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
the O
debt O
had O
been O
accumulated O
because O
the O
provincial O
funds O
had O
arrived O
late O
and O
they O
had O
to O
raise O
loans O
on O
the O
banking O
market O
. O

We O
checked O
with O
all O
the O
invoices O
that O
could O
not O
have O
gone O
so O
, O
because O
, O
otherwise O
, O
the O
interests O
should O
have O
been O
very O
high O
. O

However O
the O
CSC B-ORG
asked O
us O
for O
20 O
million O
immediately O
and O
another O
twenty O
million O
with O
monthly O
installments O
. O

There O
was O
no O
insurance O
, O
however O
, O
that O
would O
be O
the O
last O
. O

We O
decided O
not O
to O
pay O
. O

The O
following O
year O
other O
interventions O
began O
to O
go O
wrong O
. O

The O
situation O
fell O
in O
a O
few O
months O
until O
' O
99 O
when O
there O
were O
already O
four O
or O
five O
billion O
liras O
of O
debt O
. O

In O
order O
to O
cope O
with O
this O
in O
2000 O
the O
CSC B-ORG
leaders O
requested O
and O
obtained O
a O
third O
mortgage O
on O
all O
buildings O
. O

So O
it O
became O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
it O
was O
now O
impossible O
to O
repay O
all O
that O
money O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
2001 O
, O
the O
liquidation O
of O
the O
CSC B-ORG
was O
decided O
, O
the O
debt O
had O
reached O
14 O
billion O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
me O
and O
the O
other O
tenants O
in O
my O
building O
who O
refused O
to O
pay O
the O
surcharge O
in O

I O
do O

It O

it O

that O

But O

of O
Rome B-ORG
facilitates O
. O

As O
for O
Cassano B-PER
, O
I O
say O
that O
it O
is O
not O
fair O
to O
leave O
Rome B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
field O
is O
definitely O
a O
model O
to O
follow O
in O
everything O
; O

It O
is O
often O
judged O
however O
for O
what O
it O
does O
out O
, O
it O
is O
the O
price O
to O
pay O
to O
notoriety O
. O

We O
Romans O
are O
often O
difficult O
to O
bear O
, O
but O
in O
Rome B-LOC
you O
do O
n't O
feel O
so O
bad O
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... O

And O
actually O
, O
not O
even O
in O
the O
national B-ORG
team O
. O

I O
said O
and O
I O
repeat O
- O
concludes O
De B-PER
Rossi I-PER
- O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
many O
coaches O
would O
have O
the O
courage O
to O
make O
me O
debut O
at O

, O
as O
Lippi B-PER
did O
. O

A O
comparison O
with O
the O
blue O
midfielders O
of O
all O
time O
? O

I O
'd O
be O
presumptuous O
, O
and O
then O
I O
tell O
the O
truth O
: O

I O
've O
seen O
a O
few O
live O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
about O
Tardelli B-PER
, O
but O
all O
I O
remember O
about O
him O
is O
the O
mundial O
scream O
. O

There O
were O
Albertini B-PER
and O
Giannini B-PER
... O

Of O
those O
around O
today O
I O
like O
Lampard B-PER
and O
Gerrard B-PER
, O
but O
the O
strongest O
are O
Vieira B-PER
and O
Emerson B-PER
. O

And O
if O
the O
last O
name O
can O
sound O
as O
a O
further O
indication O
pro O
- O
Juve B-ORG
, O
to O
counterbalance O
it O
there O
are O
the O
preferences O
in O
the O
topic O
of O
coaches O
: O

Völler B-PER
was O
my O
baby O
idol O
: O

Once O
known O
, O
I O
say O
he O
is O
a O
man O
of O
10 O
and O
praise O
. O

Among O
the O
technicians O
, O
I O
admire O
Mancini B-PER
and O
then O
Prandelli B-PER
: O

has O
a O
sparkling O
game O
, O
unfortunately O
I O
worked O
with O
him O
only O
a O
week O
. O

So O
much O

Recently O
a O

met O
with O
the O
Health O
Councillor O

Remo B-PER
Andreolli I-PER
to O
have O
a O
response O
regarding O
the O
problems O
raised O
at O
the O
time O
by O
the O
association O
on O
the O
respect O
of O
the O
law O
194 O
on O
the O
interruption O
of O
pregnancy O
and O
on O
the O
strengthening O
of O
the O
consultors O
. O

One O
of O
the O
serious O
inconveniences O
reported O
was O
that O
of O
very O
long O
waiting O
times O
for O
the O
intervention O
of O
abortion O
in O
the O
public O
sector O
. O

The O
2003 O
data O
provided O
by O
the O
council O
member O
- O
says O
a O
statement O
from O
the O
association O
- O
say O
that O
49 O
% O
of O
the O
interventions O
at O
the O
Hospital O
Santa O
Chiara O
are O
carried O
out O
after O
21 O
days O
while O
Villa B-ORG
Bianca I-ORG
carries O
out O
36.2 O
% O
of O
the O
interventions O
within O
5 O
- O
9 O
days O
and O
40 O
% O
within O
10 O
- O
15 O
days O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
the O
private O
individual O
who O
wins O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
interventions O
( O
763 O
out O
of O
1,238 O
, O
equal O
to O
61.7 O
% O
) O
. O

The O
reason O
? O

Most O
public O
sector O
interventions O
are O
burdened O
by O
the O
S. O
Chiara O
, O
which O
however O
devotes O
only O
one O
day O
a O
week O
to O
it O
, O
as O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
only O
structure O
to O
have O
a O
relatively O
low O
number O
of O
objectors O
. O

In O
other O
hospitals O
in O
Trentino O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
objectors O
are O
percentually O
in O
much O
greater O
number O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
but O
also O
for O
other O
problems O
, O
the O
Coordination B-ORG
has O
urged O
Andreolli B-PER
to O
move O
from O
data O
analysis O
to O
a O
more O
concrete O
phase O
of O
implementation O
of O
the O
operational O
steps O
necessary O
to O
reduce O
the O
discomfort O
for O
women O
, O
creating O
conditions O
, O
so O
that O
the O
law O
194 O
is O
respected O
and O
correctly O
applied O

Fini B-PER
reacted O
with O
critical O
words O
: O

The O
autonomy O
of O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Chamber B-ORG
is O
not O
in O
question O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
questionable O
that O
this O
request O
was O
made O
by O
a O
representative O
of O
the O
League B-ORG
, O
Giancarlo B-PER
Giorgetti I-PER
, O
after O
the O
Finance O
was O
approved O
by O

of I-ORG

with O
the O
consent O
of O
the O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O

tour O

continues O

, O
after O
the O

the O
federal B-ORG

, O
Minister O

already O
thinks O
of O
the O

passage O

After O

of O

on O
the O
increase O
to O
forty O
of O
the O

sends O
an O
alarm O
to O
the O
tenants O
of O
the O
Cdl B-ORG
of O
Palazzo O

" O
There O
is O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
majority O
- O
he O
emphasizes O
- O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
what O
will O
come O
out O
of O
the O
House B-ORG
is O
the O
final O
text O
. O

The O
next O
two O
steps O
will O
only O
have O
to O
be O
formal O
. O

The O
centre O
- O
left O
, O
for O
its O
part O
, O
continues O
to O
oppose O
the O
text O
, O
in O
the O
Chamber B-ORG
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
tries O
to O
provoke O
the O
senators O
to O
rebel O
against O
the O
reform O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
evident O
- O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
in O
the O
Chamber B-ORG
, O
Pierluigi B-PER
Castagnetti I-PER
, O
emphasizes O
- O
that O
the O
majority O
has O
armored O
the O
reform O
and O
this O
is O
also O
the O
reason O
why O
it O
stands O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O

agree O
.... O

For O
Castagnetti B-PER
, O
after O
the O
rejection O
of O
the O
change O
on O
the O
age O
of O
senators O
, O
the O

will O
be O

Today O
in O

Research O

Reform O
is O
being O
discussed O

The O
reform O
of O
research O
prepared O
by O
Councillor O
Gianluca B-PER
Salvatori I-PER
is O
now O
in O
the O
commission O
of O
the O
provincial O
council O
. O

The O
reform O
envisages O
the O
transformation O
of O
the O
Itc B-ORG
and O
the O
Agricultural B-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
San I-ORG
Michele I-ORG
into O
foundations O
, O
and O
the O
introduction O
of O
greater O
autonomy O
and O
flexibility O
in O
research O
work O
. O

Less O
policy O
appointments O
, O
more O
choices O
related O
to O
specific O
competence O
. O

In O
a O
word O
: O

greater O
transparency O
. O

This O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
inspiring O
principle O
of O
the O
provincial O
reform O
law O
by O
which O
itc B-ORG
( O
and O
its O
statute O
) O
will O
be O
transformed O
, O
destined O
to O
become O
Bruno B-ORG
Kessler I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
, O
in O
honor O
of O
its O
promoter O
. O

The O
junta O
's O
complete O
discretion O
with O
regard O
to O
appointments O
of O
its O
own O
competence O
has O
failed O
to O
explain O
the O
Councillor O
for O
Innovation O
Gianluca B-PER
Salvatori I-PER
. O

This O
choice O
shows O
how O
unfounded O
the O
objections O
about O
the O
risk O
of O
flattening O
the O
autonomy O
of O
the O
institution O
are O
. O

So O
the O
old O
( O
unwritten O
) O
rules O
on O
party O
appointments O
are O
deleted O
from O
those O
( O
written O
, O
this O
time O
) O
that O
ensure O
more O
consistent O
balances O
with O
the O
aims O
of O
the O
institution B-ORG
now O
, O
and O
the O
foundation B-ORG
then O

place O
in O
a O
voice O
) O
and O
so O
the O
unknown O
was O
able O
to O
get O
away O
with O
it O
. O

If O
there O
was O
a O
need O
for O
a O
second O
confirmation O
that O
the O
young O
man O
on O
the O
bus O
was O
not O
Marco B-PER
, O
here O
is O
the O
report O
in O
which O
a O
fake O
address O
appears O
, O
a O
wrong O
date O
of O
birth O
and O
a O
signature O
completely O
different O
from O
his O
. O

Yet O
at O
home O
the O
fine O
was O
there O
and O
somehow O
the O
matter O
had O
to O
be O
resolved O
. O

The O
controller O
- O
rightly O
complains O
the O
protagonist O
of O
the O
case O
- O
wrote O
the O
report O
without O
verifying O
by O
document O
the O
truthfulness O
of O
the O
details O
provided O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
infringement O
. O

So O
now O
I O
find O
myself O
having O
to O
answer O
for O
a O
wrongdoing O
committed O
by O
another O
person O
who O
, O
however O
, O
by O
voice O
, O
I O
repeat O
, O
gave O
my O
name O
and O
surname O
, O
while O
the O
date O
of O
birth O
, O
the O
address O
and O
the O
civic O
number O
are O
different O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
signature O
completely O
illegible O
. O

The O
signal O
made O
by O
Marco B-PER
is O
the O
public O
complaint O
that O
similar O
jokes O
can O
happen O
to O
everyone O
. O

Going O
back O
to O
the O
concrete O
case O
, O
Marco B-PER
's O
dad O
has O
nothing O
left O
to O
do O
but O
go O
to O
the O
offices O
of O
Trentino B-ORG
transport I-ORG
to O
ask O
for O
information O

From O

out O

obtain O
the O

the O

They O
were O
all O
very O
kind O
- O
he O
comments O
. O
- O
They O
had O
me O
fill O
out O
a O
form O
and O
they O
explained O
to O
me O
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
something O
like O
this O
has O
happened O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
the O
Commune B-LOC
, O
they O
made O
it O
known O
that O
a O
similar O
story O
happened O
to O
a O
girl O
of O
Ravina B-LOC
, O
recipient O
of O
as O
many O
as O
five O
or O
six O
" O
jokes O
" O
of O
the O
genre O
. O

The O
risk O
that O
someone O
, O
to O
make O
fun O
of O
a O
friend O
, O
caught O
on O
the O
bus O
without O
a O
ticket O
, O
enjoys O
providing O
false O
generality O
, O
unfortunately O
is O
always O
present O
. O

" O
One O
thing O
that O
can O
actually O
happen O
if O
the O
controller O
confines O
himself O
to O
voice O
recognition O
without O
checking O
the O
documents O
" O
has O
replied O
to O
him O
by O
the O
same O
offices O
of O
Trentino B-ORG
transports I-ORG
and O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
. O

The O
funny O
thing O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
the O
offices O
that O
notify O
the O
infringements O
, O
much O
more O
sober O
, O
the O
trouble O
of O
going O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
matter O
took O
it O
because O
, O
starting O
only O
from O
a O
name O
and O
a O
surname O
have O
gone O
back O
to O
the O
address O
of O
Marco B-PER
. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
understood O
, O
however O
, O
if O
, O
instead O
of O
Marco B-PER
, O
the O
recipient O
of O
the O
fine O
had O
been O
Mario B-PER
Rossi I-PER
, O
to O
which O
of O
the O
nine O
people O
with O
this O
name O
appearing O
on O
the O
Trentino B-LOC
telephone O
directory O
would O
have O
sent O
the O
fine O
. O

Could O
n't O
know O
. O

What O
is O
certain O
is O
, O
instead O
, O
that O
it O
is O
up O
to O
the O
recipient O
of O
the O
infringement O
to O
prove O
that O
he O
is O
extraneous O
to O
the O
matter O
. O

I O
'm O
doing O
anything O
but O
simple O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
pay O
- O
continues O
the O
father O
, O
- O
but O
I O
lost O
an O
entire O
afternoon O
, O
over O
all O
it O
was O
holiday O
period O
, O
around O
offices O
. O

Moreover O
, O
before O
the O
event O
is O
concluded O
it O
will O
still O
be O
a O
long O
time O
because O
, O
they O
explained O
to O
me O
, O
to O
cancel O
the O
oblation O
it O
takes O
more O
or O
less O
a O
year O
. O

The O
fact O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
this O
long O
story O
remains O
is O
that O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
it O
takes O
little O
to O
pretend O
to O
be O
another O
person O
. O

And O
he O
who O
gets O
home O
the O
fine O
then O
has O
it O
hard O
to O
explain O
that O
he O
is O
not O
the O
wrongdoer O
. O

So O
much O
so O
that O
Marco B-PER
, O
who O
for O
all O
this O
fuss O
did O
not O
take O
it O
so O
much O
, O
from O
the O
" O
high O
" O
of O
his O
young O
age O
he O
feels O
to O
give O
advice O
to O
the O

: O

Trusting O

good O
, O
not O

the O

began O
on O

. O

That O
afternoon O
, O
immediately O
after O
lunch O
, O
the O
woman O
was O
attacked O
for O
no O
reason O
by O
the O
neighbor O
who O
for O
many O
years O
had O
given O
signs O
of O
mental O
imbalance O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
in O
1979 O
she O
had O
shot O
at O
the O
neighbor O
's O
door O
. O

The O
attack O
had O
previously O
been O
verbal O
with O
the O
energetic O
who O
accused O
her O
of O
having O
attacked O
her O
back O
, O
then O
she O
had O
become O
brutal O
and O
violent O
. O

The O
brute O
had O
hit O
his O
victim O
several O
times O
in O
the O
back O
and O
head O
with O
an O

Only O
the O
promptness O
of O
reflections O
of O
the O
poor O
girl O
, O
who O
had O
defended O
herself O
with O
the O
umbrella O
she O
had O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
could O
avoid O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
woman O
was O
hospitalized O
for O
two O
weeks O
, O
first O
at O
the O
neurosurgery O
in O
Bolzano B-LOC
and O
then O
at O
the O
Santa O
Chiara O
. O

Since O
then O
his O
life O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
same O
. O

On O
the O
physical O
plane O
complains O
vertigo O
when O
he O
suddenly O
moves O
his O
head O
, O
he O
suffers O
trafficked O

, O
sleeps O
with O
difficulty O
, O
wakes O
up O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
, O

and O
is O
forced O
to O
take O

Even O
the O
husband O
still O
suffers O
severe O
consequences O
of O
the O
assault O
suffered O
by O
his O
wife O
. O

For O
doctors O
who O
have O
visited O
him O
, O
he O
suffers O
from O
a O
post O

traumatic O
chronic O
stress O

. O

The O
attacker O
, O
instead O
, O
has O
been O
hospitalized O
for O
years O
in O
a O
nursing O
home O
. O

Now O
the O
attacked O
woman O
and O
her O
husband O
have O
decided O
to O
sue O
the O
aggressor O
and O
the O
health B-ORG
company I-ORG
because O
she O
was O
responsible O
for O
the O
surveillance O
of O
the O
man O
who O
had O
long O
been O
suffering O
from O
paranoid O
schizophrenia O
. O

The O
couple O
claims O
a O
total O
damages O
of O
183 O
thousand O
euros O
, O
122 O
thousand O
euros O
for O
the O
damages O
suffered O
by O
the O
woman O
and O
61 O
thousand O
for O
those O
brought O
back O
by O
the O
husband O
. O

In O
recent O
days O
the O
act O
of O
citation O
has O
been O
notified O
to O
the O
health B-ORG
company I-ORG
. O

According O
to O
the O
law O
of O
the O
actors O
, O
the O
reason O
on O
which O
the O
responsibility O
is O
based O
is O
the O
failure O
by O
the O
health B-ORG
company I-ORG
of O
the O
obligation O
to O
prevent O
the O
harmful O
fact O
. O

This O
obligation O
is O
imputable O
to O
those O
who O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
could O
prevent O
aggression O
. O

That O
is O
, O
the O
Company B-ORG
, O
since O
, O
according O
to O
the O
attacker O
and O
husband O
, O
had O
to O
watch O
the O
neighbor O
since O
he O
had O
repeatedly O
given O
signs O
of O
psychic O
instability O
. O

The O
aggressor O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
events O
was O
subject O
to O
psychiatric O
medical O
treatment O
by O
the O
health B-ORG
company I-ORG
itself O
. O

His O
psychic O
conditions O
, O
characterized O
by O
violence O
and O
aggression O
, O
had O
become O
apparent O
already O
in O
1979 O
, O
when O
from O
the O
window O
of O
his O
house O
he O
had O
shot O
with O
a O
rifle O
against O
the O
house O
of O
the O
neighbor O
attacked O
twenty O
years O
later O
. O

Following O
this O
episode O
, O
the O
man O
was O
locked O
up O
in O
a O
criminal O
asylum O
in O
Castiglione B-LOC
delle I-LOC
Stiviere I-LOC
from O
which O
he O
managed O
to O
escape O
. O

He O
was O
subjected O
to O
mandatory O
medical O
treatment O
in O
1980 O
and O
1997 O
. O

In O
1996 O
he O
had O
shot O
the O
Carabinieri B-ORG
's O
car O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
attack O
, O
man O
lived O
isolated O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
in O
his O
home O
. O

According O
to O
the O
attacker O
, O
however O
, O
the O
health B-ORG
company I-ORG
had O
never O
done O
anything O
to O
monitor O
and O
limit O
man O
. O

The O
attacker O
was O
now O
suffering O
from O
a O
real O
persecutory O
delirium O
. O

That O
's O
why O
he O
attacked O
the O
woman O
accusing O
her O
of O
sticking O
something O
to O
her O
back O
and O
then O
accusing O
her O
of O
killing O
his O
rabbits O
. O

Man O

has O
long O
been O
known O
to O

However O
, O
according O
to O
the O
case O
of O
the O

and O
the O
husband O
, O
no O
one O
did O
anything O

In O

arising O
from O
a O
general O
formulation O
of O

the O

actively O

In O
particular O

For O

According O
to O

Eccher I-PER
, O
the O
two O
opinions O
of O

Mastragostino B-PER
beyond O
the O
conclusions O
of O

, O
confirm O
the O
elements O
of O

to O
be O
borne O
by O
the O
situation O
of O
Words B-PER

In O
fact O
it O
is O
recognized O
, O
although O
among O
a O
thousand O
useless O
distinctions O
, O
how O
the O
Health B-ORG

is O
actually O
a O
functional O
body O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC

how O

has O
held O
a O
position O
with O
the O
qualification O
of O
medical O

The O
search O
for O
and O
verification O
of O
the O
correspondence O
between O
the O
legal O
- O
administrative O
status O
of O
manager O
and O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
tasks O
actually O
performed O
is O
an O
absolutely O
arbitrary O
and O
forced O
passage O
when O
the O
provincial O

not O
to O
any O

that O

In O
summary O

it O

where O

With O
Forza B-ORG

openly O
praises O

his O

Meanwhile O

the O

announces O
the O
intention O
of O

to O
be O
sympathetic O
towards O

when O
it O
comes O
to O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
deep O
rift O
that O
urban O
maneuver O
is O
causing O
within O
minorities O
has O
emerged O
. O

He O
began O
Armando B-PER
Benedetti I-PER
, O
leader O
of O
the O
Centre B-ORG
, O
who O
complained O
that O
he O
had O
been O
completely O
snubbed O
by O
the O
three O
minority O
representatives O
in O
the O
town O

, O
left O
to O
the O
dark O
of O
what O
was O
ripening O
. O

My O
colleague O
Mr O
Ferrari B-PER

I O
will O
therefore O
reserve O
the O
right O
to O
decide O
for O
ourselves O
how O

Giorgio B-PER

has O
also O
announced O
that O
Forza B-ORG

will O
evaluate O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O

. O

A O
statement O
that O
someone O
had O
even O
interpreted O
as O
a O
willingness O
to O
say O
yes O
to O
the O
mid O

left O
variant O
. O

" O
No O
, O
at O
most O
it O
will O
be O
an O

has O
then O
clarified O
the O
parent O

In O
his O
speech O
, O
however O
, O
he O
launched O
in O
open O
praise O
of O
the O
Councillor O

I O
very O
much O
appreciated O
his O
work O
and O
surprised O
me O
for O
the O
professionalism O
gained O
. O

I O
hope O
that O
this O
statement O
will O
not O
be O
mistaken O
for O
piggeria O
or O
worse O
still O
iniqucio O

But O

with O
a O

off O

welcomes O
the O

Filippin I-PER
for O
his O

has O
not O
resisted O

to O

" O
I O
hope O

as O
announced O
, O
that O
it O
is O
not O
the O
intention O
of O
an O
important O

said O

The O

the O

that O

been O
given O

And O
he O
continued O
with O
other O

, O
focusing O
in O
particular O
on O
Via O

Albera O
a O
Martignano B-LOC

is O
why O
he O
accuses O
the O

acted O
in O
an O
amateur O
way O
, O
and O
Via O

Pozzata O
a O

for O
which O
he O
suspects O
a O
leak O
of O

that O
would O
have O
prompted O
a O
builder O
to O
grab O
the O
area O
before O

As O
for O

favourable O

what O

about O

For O
three O
days O
the O

the O

the O
North B-ORG

that O
alone O
continues O
its O
battle O
against O
the O
reform O
of O
the O
regulation O
. O

The O
system O
that O
currently O
governs O
the O
Council B-ORG
's O
work O
allows O
only O
one O
adviser O
to O
block O
the O
work O
even O
for O

weeks O
: O

It O
is O
the O
demonstration O
that O
this O
regulation O
must O
be O
changed O
, O
it O
was O
the O
disconcerted O
comment O
of O
most O
of O
the O
councilors O
during O
the O
Divine B-PER
Marathon O
. O

The O
latter O
has O
repeated O
its O
objective O
several O
times O
: O

In O
recent O
days O
, O
he O
had O
asked O
for O
the O
reform O
of O
the O
groups O
to O
be O
postponed O
to O
the O
next O
parliamentary O
term O
, O
while O
yesterday O
he O
motivated O
his O
protest O
against O
the O
cut O
- O
off O
article O
- O
obstructionism O
. O

Majority O
and O
opposition O
have O
in O
fact O
agreed O
on O
the O
choice O
to O
remove O
the O
councilors O
the O
faculty O
to O
do O
obstructionism O
: O

The O
draft O

will O
have O
to O
come O
to O

in O

in O
the O
classroom O
by O
the O
dates O
set O
by O
the O

Obstructionism O
will O
only O
be O

three O

are O
opposed O
, O
representing O
one O

( O

This O
choice O
- O
according O
to O
Sergio B-PER
Divina I-PER
- O
in O
fact O
cancels O
any O
power O
of O

Today O

The O

yesterday O
not O

call O

the O

commented O
yesterday O
Giorgio B-PER

who O
thus O
also O
cleared O
the O

a O
few O
weeks O
the O

point O
on O

the O

signs O
the O

with O

we O
do O
not O

Today O
the O
regulation O
provides O
a O
budget O
of O
about O
6 O
thousand O
kilometers O
refundable O
for O
each O

. O

However O
, O
many O
members O
do O
not O
use O
them O
and O
do O
not O
ask O
for O
reimbursement O

For O
this O
reason O
the O
groups O
propose O
that O
instead O
of O
dividing O
the O
kilometres O
between O
the O

all O
the O

can O
be O
managed O
by O
the O

who O
will O
distribute O
the O
kilometers O
according O

the O
needs O

It O
will O
be O
easier O
to O
use O
them O
all O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
group O
leader O
may O
request O
further O
reimbursements O
from O
the O

went O
to O
the O

had O
been O

just O
because O
she O
was O
afraid O

her O

" O
we O

There O

In O

its O

be O
authorized O

assert O
his O
reasons O

And O
therefore O
to O
make O
the O
House B-ORG

that O
it O
will O
have O
to O
decide O
by O
absolute O
majority O

The O
forecast O
of O
a O

which O
will O

in O
case O

in O
the O

where O

also O

the O
little O
Beslan B-LOC

The O
place O
where O
the O
fate O

1,200 O

sank O
into O
the O
hell O
of O
the O
battle O
unleashed O
between O

How O
many O
have O
been O
the O
dead O
of O
that O
end O
of O
bursts O
and O

we O
still O
do O
not O
know O
exactly O
. O

Sources O
of O
the O
largest O
morgue O
in O

reported O
a O
figure O
of O
394 O
people O

Of O
course O
there O
are O
565 O
injured O
still O
hospitalized O
, O
more O
than O
100 O
- O
especially O
among O
the O
youngest O
- O
under O
serious O
conditions O
. O

And O
there O
remains O
the O
anguish O
, O
sometimes O
strewn O
with O
desperate O
anger O
, O
of O
those O
who O
are O
looking O
for O
news O
of O
the O
200 O

missing O

the O
confusion O
following O
the O

but O
also O
- O
unfortunately O
- O
among O
the O
dead O
not O
yet O
identified O
: O

a O
hundred O
, O
60 O
of O
them O
so O
badly O
reduced O
that O
they O
are O
unrecognizable O
without O
examination O
of O
the O

But O
the O
drama O
is O
that O
the O
total O
count O
of O
the O
dead O
could O
reach O
700 O

including O
two O

In O

of O
the O

A O
marginal O
task O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
a O
marginal O
one O
, O
said O
the O
woman O
, O
was O
her O
presence O
in O
the O

so O
much O
that O
she O
was O

would O
have O

The O
wish O
of O
the O
Roman O

is O
that O
the O
repentance O
of O

can O
now O
open O

to O
the O
absolute O
untrustworthiness O
of O

which O
leaves O
ample O

the O
Icef O
- O
explained O
Gilberto B-PER
Barbieri I-PER
, O
of O
the O

Clesius B-ORG
- O
takes O
into O
account O
the O
" O

, O
from O
which O
were O
deducted O
i.e. O
expenses O
such O
as O
the O

as O

that O

aspire O
to O

Let O

we O

if O
we O
only O

how O
to O

above O
all O
that O
of O
Luca B-PER
Bonazza I-PER
, O
the O
undisputed O

What O
's O
it O

play O
side O

side O
? O

Better O
or O
worse O
for O
those O
who O
make O
the O
second O

? O

Ah O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
, O
it O
is O
a O
huge O
advantage O
to O
have O
ahead O
of O
one O
like O
him O
, O
which O
is O
unquestionably O
the O
best O
striker O
in O
the O
region B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
the O
central O
point O
of O
reference O
and O
already O
this O
creates O
spaces O
and O
greatly O
facilitates O
the O
task O
of O
those O
who O
have O
to O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
sides O
, O
as O
it O
is O
up O

In O
addition O
it O
knows O
how O
to O
shore O

support O
well O
, O
in O

it O
is O
too O
easy O
with O

But O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
goals O
and O
feats O
it O
takes O
away O
a O
little O
' O
visibility O

And O
then O
it O
beats O
all O
the O
rigors O
: O

Does O
n't O
it O
make O
you O
a O
little O
jealousy O

it O

him O
there O
are O
more O

for O

you O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
like O
all O
that O
genre O
, O
afro O

. O

Do O
n't O

does O
n't O
he O
? O

Sure O

the O

28 O

to O
the O
emergency O
room O

the O

diagnosed O
a O

The O
following O
day O
the O
patient O
was O
subjected O
to O
surgery O
to O
reduce O
the O
fracture O
with O
osteosynthesis O
, O
i.e. O
by O
applying O
a O
titanium O
screw O
on O
the O
fractured O
bone O
. O

On O
April O

, O
the O
young O
man O
was O
discharged O
: O

by O
now O
it O
seemed O
on O
the O
way O
to O
a O
rapid O
recovery O

It O
was O
n't O
like O
that O
. O

In O
June O
the O
wound O
gave O
signs O
of O
infection O

On O
July O
29 O
, O
1999 O
, O
the O
student O
returned O
to O
Villa O
Igea O
where O
they O
diagnosed O
an O
allergy O
to O
osteosynthesis O
. O

A O
new O
intervention O
was O
needed O
for O
their O
removal O
, O
followed O
by O
antibiotic O
therapy O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
instead O
of O
solving O
itself O
became O
a O
real O
ordeal O
: O

the O
wound O
did O
not O
heal O
but O
continued O
to O
be O
infected O
. O

The O
patient O
began O
a O
painful O
pilgrimage O
between O
centres O
and O
specialist O
doctors O
in O
Northern O
Italy O

His O
life O
had O
been O
devastated O
: O

No O

, O
no O

no O

this O
until O

clinic O

specialized O
in O
this O
type O
of O
infection O
, O
correctly O
framed O
the O
problem O
. O

Thus O
, O
on O
31 O
July O
2002 O
, O
more O
than O
three O
years O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
the O
young O

entered O

subjected O
to O
a O
decisive O
intervention O

Certainly O
the O
healing O
was O
not O
immediate O
, O
but O
with O
the O
passing O
of O
the O
weeks O
the O
wound O
finally O
healed O
. O

Today O
the O
young O
man O
has O
completely O
recovered O
the O
use O
of O
the O
limb O
even O
if O
the O

the O

The O
third B-ORG
commission I-ORG
- O
continues O
Pinter B-PER
- O
in O
1995 O
had O
made O
an O
investigation O
on O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
setting O
up O
the O
park O
" O
Lagorai O
- O
Cima O
d O
' O
Asta O
" O
in O
front O
of O
a O
petition O
that O
asked O
for O
it O
. O

Even O
then O
it O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
for O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
parks O
it O
is O
indispensable O
the O
will O
of O
the O
local O
realities O
concerned O
. O

And O
already O
then O
as O
today O
a O
debate O
developed O
that O
reveals O
a O
general O
ignorance O
about O
what O
nature O
park O
means O
. O

In O
these O
days O
many O
have O
equated O
the O
park O
with O
new O
constraints O
, O
with O
an O
ingesting O
of O
the O
territory O
. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
case O
- O
says O
the O
former O
city O
council O
member O
- O
this O
is O
propaganda O
and O
it O
is O
surprising O
to O
hear O
these O
statements O
even O
from O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
provincial O
council O
member O
to O
tourism O
, O
Tiziano B-PER
Mellaniri I-PER
, O
who O
shows O
that O
he O
does O
not O
know O
what O
the O
parks O
are O
. O

And O
the O
provincial O
councilman O
of O
Sdr B-ORG
gives O
some O
examples O
: O

The O
connection O
Pinzolo B-LOC
- O
Campiglio B-LOC
is O
located O
in O
part O
in O
the O
territory O
of O
the O
Park B-ORG
Adamello I-ORG
- O
Brenta O
, O
this O
does O
not O
prevent O
its O
realization O
. O

I O
'll O
say O
more O
. O

In O
the O
park O
area O
, O
as O
far O
as O
the O
reuse O
of O
the O
building O
heritage O
is O
concerned O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
do O
what O
is O
not O
possible O
elsewhere O
, O
for O
example O
to O
rebuild O
the O
ruins O
. O

The O
former O
city O
council O
member O
emphasizes O
these O
aspects O
in O
order O
to O
say O
that O
: O

" O
Natural O
parks O
are O
an O
opportunity O
for O
development O
and O
enhancement O
not O
only O
of O
environmental O
conservation O
" O
. O

Paradoxically O
and O
for O
this O
reason O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
statements O
of O
the O
mayor O
of O
Vallarsa B-LOC
, O
who O
says O
that O
he O
has O
preserved O
an O
intact O
territory O
and O
therefore O
not O
needing O
the O
park O
, O
- O
continues O
Pinter O
- O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
is O
preserved O
more O
, O
from O
the O
naturalistic O
point O
of O
view O
, O
a O
territory O
today O
unattractive O
, O
leaving O
it O
as O
it O
is O
rather O
than O
establishing O
the O
park O
. O

" O
We O
do O
not O
understand O
- O
concludes O
Pinter B-PER
- O
that O
the O
park O
is O
an O
opportunity O
for O
development O
, O
it O
means O
keeping O
the O
mountain O
alive O
, O
it O
offers O
new O
opportunities O
, O
it O
is O
not O
only O
environmental O
conservation O
. O

Marco B-PER

these O

that O
there O

still O
a O
long O

What O
bothers O
, O
personally O
, O
is O
the O
arrogant O
attitude O
that O
is O

The O
message O
that O
comes O
is O
that O
in O

, O
you O
ask O

then O
, O
if O
there O
are O

it O

up O

It O
adds O
that O

what O

the O

The O

A O
meeting O
that O
Anichini B-PER
defines O
from O
the O
rather O
positive O
outcome O
, O
so O
much O
to O
make O
hope O
in O
a O
quick O
solution O
, O
but O
that O
has O
also O
evidenced O
the O
permanence O
of O
some O
knot O
to O
be O
dissolved O
, O
especially O
from O
the O
economic O
point O

view O

The O
parties O

exchanged O
precise O

Anichini B-PER
says O
- O
, O
the O
times O
have O
been O
defined O
and O
it O
is O
common O
the O
will O
to O
arrive O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
to O
an O
understanding O
, O
so O
I O
can O
say O
quite O
confident O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
distances O
have O
not O
been O
fully O
filled O
, O
especially O
on O
the O
economic O
side O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
company O
has O
significantly O
changed O
its O
initial O
position O
. O

Now O
- O
he O
adds O
- O
it O
is O
up O
to O
the O
union O
to O
be O
found O
ready O
to O
sign O
the O
agreement O
. O

And O
above O
all O
, O
work O
to O
ensure O
the O
solution O
of O
a O
very O
serious O
problem O
such O
as O
the O
drastic O
decline O
in O
productivity O
, O
on O
which O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
make O
political O
considerations O
, O
but O
which O
for O
the O
company O
is O
certainly O
an O
element O
of O
difficulty O
for O
the O
successful O
outcome O
of O
the O
negotiations O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
request O
of O

and O
the O
consequent O

Anichini B-PER
reiterated O
the O

the O

The O

team O

So O
the O
blues O
think O
and O
the O
transformation O
, O
they O
say O
in O
choir O
, O
coincided O
with O
the O
arrival O

Lippi B-PER

For O
the O
way O
this O
national B-ORG
team O
works O
it O
really O
looks O
like O
a O
club O
team O
and O
this O
can O
only O
do O
us O
good O
players O
- O
says O
Gianluca B-PER
Zambrotta I-PER
- O
you O
really O
have O
the O
feeling O
that O
an O
important O
project O
is O
being O
created O
and O
this O
is O
the O
ideal O
in O
view O
of O
the O
2006 O

In O
short O
, O
there O
is O
the O
basis O
and O
the O
basis O
for O
finally O
achieving O
great O
results O
. O

The O
juventine O
player O
is O
one O
of O
the O
veterans O
of O
the O
blue O
group O
and O
explains O
how O
this O
change O
took O
place O
: O

With O
the O
arrival O
of O
Lippi B-PER
this O
concept O
of O
national B-ORG
equal O
to O
club O
has O
become O
more O
marked O
, O
more O
concrete O
. O

This O
was O
not O
the O
case O
before O
, O
perhaps O
this O
concept O
was O
only O
felt O
in O
the O
final O
phase O
of O
the O
Europeans O
in O
2000 O
. O

The O
National B-ORG
team O
seems O
to O
resemble O
more O
and O
more O
a O
club O
not O
only O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
technical O
management O
, O
but O
also O
for O
other O
aspects O
that O
concern O
for O
example O
the O
whole O
staff O
, O
the O
life O
and O
the O
rules O
to O
follow O
in O
the O
withdrawal O
, O
participation O
in O
solidarity O
initiatives O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
everything O
is O
being O
done O
to O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
in O
club O
teams O
here O
- O
says O
Daniele B-PER
Bonera I-PER
, O
one O
of O
the O
youngest O
and O
among O
the O
last O
arrived O
in O
the O
blue O
party O
- O
what O
struck O
me O
most O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
here O
they O
make O
us O
all O
feel O
like O
equals O
, O
all O
considered O
in O
the O
same O
way O
and O
this O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
very O
important O
and O
very O
productive O
. O

Even O
Aimo B-PER
Diana I-PER
removes O
all O
conditional O
: O

This O
National B-ORG
team O
is O
a O
team O
of O
clubs O
and O
we O
understand O
it O
from O
the O
management O
and O
working O
methods O
of O
Lippi B-PER
that O
are O
in O
practice O
the O
same O
adopted O
in O
our O
respective O
teams O
- O
the O
defender O
of O
Sampdoria B-ORG
emphasizes O
- O
for O
example O
we O
players O
are O
not O
thrown O
in O
the O
field O
at O
random O
but O
we O
work O
in O
depth O
on O
the O
schemes O
, O
coordinates O
, O
in O
search O
of O
a O
true O
understanding O
. O

Another O
important O
aspect O
is O
that O
Lippi B-PER
makes O
the O
convocations O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
indications O
provided O
by O
the O

: O

who O

Yesterday O
most O

the O

did O
not O

talk O

What O
the O

said O
is O
what O
we O
think O

Call O
her O
. O

That O
's O
a O
fact O

the O
manager O
was O
searched O
in O
the O
various O
locations O
, O
were O
left O
more O
messages O
, O
but O
did O
not O
make O
herself O
heard O
. O

No O
one O
called O
the O
newspaper O
to O
explain O
the O
reasons O
for O
a O
choice O
, O
which O
satisfied O
some O
and O
embittered O
others O
. O

He O
speaks O
, O
but O
with O
the O
promise O
of O
anonymity O
, O
a O
mother O
: O

" O
My O
children O
go O
to O
school O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
them O
to O
be O
affected O
, O
since O
that O

is O
still O
working O
. O
" O

It O
is O
not O
afraid O
that O
now O
, O
with O
a O
new O
alternate O
, O
the O
quality O
of O
teaching O
will O
be O
affected O
. O

It O
's O
been O
years O
since O
my O
son O
went O
to O
school O
with O
alternates O
as O
teachers O
. O

In O
the O
end O
it O
's O
better O
this O
way O
. O

But O
does O
this O
distrust O
arise O
from O
the O
lesson O
of O
sexual O
education O
? O

The O
speech O
is O
much O
wider O
. O

We O
, O
in O
the O
family O
, O
are O
not O
opposed O
to O
sex O
education O
lessons O
, O
indeed O
. O

The O
point O
is O
that O
that O
lesson O
was O
made O
without O
warning O
us O
. O

Too O
explicit O
terms O
have O
been O
used O
, O
which O
for O
a O

, O
according O

us O
, O
are O
not O
good O

And O
it O
's O
not O
about O

bigots O

I O
warned O

The O
case O

the O

who O
provided O
the O
controller O
who O
had O
caught O
him O
without O
a O
ticket O
the O
name O

, O
reported O
yesterday O
by O
L B-ORG
' I-ORG
Adige I-ORG
, O
is O
not O
an O
absolute O
novelty O
. O

It O
happens O
with O
a O
certain O
frequency O
and O
it O
is O
something O
that O
makes O
the O
number O
one O
public O
transport O
company O
lose O
its O
temper O
: O

It O
is O
scandalous O
that O
one O
child O
gives O
the O
name O
of O
another O
and O
does O
not O
purchase O
a O
subscription O
that O
costs O
52 O
euros O
per O
year O
. O

A O
misery O
compared O
with O
other O
national O
realities O
. O

In O
Verona B-LOC
, O
just O
to O
give O
an O
example O
, O
you O
pay O
according O
to O
the O

between O
22 O

78 O
euros O
per O
month O
. O

Compared O
with O
our O
prices O
, O
they O
make O
you O
laugh O
. O

But O
beyond O
the O
tariffs O
, O
which O
in O
recent O
weeks O
have O
raised O
a O
great O
fuss O
at O
the O
provincial O
level O
, O
it O
amazes O
that O
the O
controller O
has O
trusted O
the O
name O
provided O
by O
the O
boy O
and O
has O
not O
searched O
for O
feedback O
in O
an O
official O
document O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
- O
explains O
Ceola B-PER
- O
is O
that O
a O
teenager O
may O
not O
even O
have O
the O
document O
or O
, O
if O
he O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
pay O
, O
say O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
it O
. O

I O
understand O
that O
giving O
a O
fine O
on O
the O
word O
of O
one O
who O
can O
be O
, O
as O
in O
this O
case O
, O
a O
scammer O
ends O
up O
creating O
scratchers O
to O
those O
who O
do O
not O
enter O
but O
there O
are O
no O
counter O
- O
measures O
. O

Everyone O
should O
be O
honest O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

In O
that O
4 O
% O
of O
abusers O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
people O
who O
provide O
fake O
generalities O
, O
there O
are O
also O
null O
and O
voids O
who O
can O
not O
fear O
retaliation O
and O
foreclosures O
. O

And O
for O
those O
there O
is O
no O
remedy O
. O

They O
will O
continue O
to O
scrounge O

defying O
the O

, O
the O
fact O

not O
constitute O

the O

Ruggero B-PER

The O
man O
was O
accused O
of O
violating O
the O
rules O
on O
hunting O
following O
the O
slaughter O
of O
two O
specimens O
of O
roe O

made O

in O
September O
2003 O
. O

The O
judgment O
constitutes O
an O
important O
precedent O
and O
in O
some O
way O
helps O
to O
reassure O
the O

If O

indeed O
to O
overtake O
the O
plan O
of O
killings O
already O
on O
the O
first O

of O
hunting O
, O
the O
responsibility O
can O
not O
be O
attributed O
to O
the O
president O

Judge O
Carlo B-PER
Ancona I-PER
points O
out O
in O
the O
judgment O
that O
hunters O
can O
not O
be O
punished O
because O
they O
can O
not O
be O
informed O
in O
real O
time O
about O
the O
killings O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
President O
may O
not O
be O
punished O
, O
as O
he O
has O
no O
tools O
to O
prevent O
the O
killing O
of O

In O

Hypothesis O
rejected O
by O
the O
President O

because O
from O
the O
geological O
point O
of O
view O
, O
it O

not O
the O

Another O
topic O
of O

is O
the O

it O
touched O

bringing O
to O
the O

the O
original O

Another O
counter O

trend O
proposal O
is O
to O
delete O
the O

the O

in O
order O
to O

The O
third O

Centered O
therefore O
the O
objective O
of O
making O
Oltrasoni O
a O
small O
Woodstock O
Trentino O
or O
better O
to O
lay O
the O
foundations O
for O
an O
event O
able O
to O
grow O
in O
the O
next O
few O
years O
: O

Frankly O
we O
did O
n't O
expect O
an O
answer O
of O
this O
type O
- O
explained O
Max B-PER
of O
the O
association O
Sonà B-ORG
who O
organized O
Oltrasoni O
- O
the O
young O
people O
, O
but O
not O
only O
them O
, O
have O
shown O
how O
there O
is O
a O
desire O
for O
appointments O
to O
the O
sign O
of O
music O
. O

A O
success O
therefore O
even O
if O
it O
is O
thought O
that O
the O
park O
of O
Oltra O
hosted O
for O
the O
first O
time O
a O
concert O
of O
this O
type O
: O

It O
was O
a O
real O
experiment O
- O
Max B-PER
points O
out O
- O
in O
a O
new O
location O
that O
hosted O
many O
groups O
on O
a O
stage O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
situation O
. O

Seventeen O
bands O
, O
Trentino O
but O
not O
only O
, O
who O
performed O
on O
stage O
starting O
from O
Friday O
evening O
where O
to O
hit O
in O
the O
sign O
were O
according O
to O
Max B-PER
both O
the O
Geisha B-ORG
and O
the O
Hutchinson B-ORG
with O
an O
abrasive O
live O
that O
confirms O
how O
good O
was O
said O
of O
this O
group O
. O

On O
Saturday O
afternoon O
it O
was O

but O
above O
all O
by O
the O

: O

They O
really O
surprised O
these O
guys O
from O
Trento B-LOC
who O
also O
completely O
changed O
their O
set O
compared O
to O
the O
past O
. O

The O
night O
was O
all O
at O
the O
sign O
of O
the O

Reggae O

with O
over O
a O
thousand O
people O
who O
danced O
until O
four O

in O

. O

Sunday O
was O

we O
already O

at O

: O

" O
Our O

is O
to O
give O
continuity O
to O
Oltrasuoni O
- O
explained O
Matteo B-PER
Cretti I-PER
president O
of O

- O
perhaps O
in O
a O
different O
way O
with O
two O
weekends O
of O

and O
with O
the O
even O
greater O
involvement O
of O

" O

Giving O
space O
and O

to O
the O

has O
always O
been O
one O
of O

's O
goals O
that O

reflect O
even O
more O
strongly O

I O

I O

I O

it O

there O

No O

I O
remember O
a O

the O

the O

The O

the O
examination O
of O
the O
bill O
by O
the O
House B-ORG
is O
scheduled O
for O
Monday O
, O
September O
13 O
. O

The O
Roman O
event O
is O
considered O
important O
, O
because O
it O
will O
be O
the O
occasion O
to O
illustrate O
directly O
to O
Calderoli B-PER
the O
concerns O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
related O
to O
institutional O
reform O
. O

A O
reform O
that O
presents O
many O
problematic O
aspects O
, O
starting O
with O
the O
system O
to O
be O
implemented O
if O
Parliament B-ORG
decides O
to O
amend O
the O
Statute O
of O
autonomy O
. O

The O
Constitution O
provides O
that O
the O
Trentino B-LOC
Alto I-LOC
Adige I-LOC
Charter O
may O
be O
amended O
after O
double O
reading O
( O
i.e. O
, O
four O
votes O
in O
all O
) O
by O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
without O
the O
obligation O
to O
involve O
regions O
under O
special O
statute O
. O

Article O
33 O
of O
the O
Constitutional O
Bill O
proposed O
by O
the O
centre O
- O
right O
states O
instead O
that O
the O
Statutes O
may O
be O
amended O
by O
agreement O
with O
the O
regions O
concerned O
, O
but O
if O
this O
agreement O
is O
not O
reached O
within O
six O
months O
of O
the O
submission O
of O
the O
proposals O
, O
the O
Parliament B-ORG
may O
also O
make O
the O
amendments O
with O
the O
contrary O
opinion O
of O
the O
local O
realities O
. O

By O
Dellai B-PER
and O
Bezzi B-PER
, O
this O
hypothesis O
was O
fiercely O
opposed O
: O

The O
text O
- O
it O
has O
been O
said O
- O
introduces O
a O
series O
of O
serious O
violations O
of O
the O
autonomy O
of O
the O
special O
regions O
and O
autonomous O
provinces O
. O

The O
Presidents O
will O
then O
present O
Mr O
Calderoli B-PER
with O
a O
five O
- O
point O
document O
, O
which O
proposes O
a O
series O
of O
amendments O
to O
the O
legal O
text O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
drafting O
of O
the O
new O
Statutes O
, O
a O
strong O
involvement O
of O
the O
Regional O
Councils O
will O
be O
proposed O
, O
not O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
debate O
in O
Parliament B-ORG
, O
but O
at O
second O
reading O
by O
the O
Chambers O
. O

For O
the O
presidents O
, O
the O
final O
word O
must O
be O
left O
to O
the O
regional O
assemblies O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
what O
is O
now O
assumed O
by O
the O
reform O
. O

Another O
cause O
for O
concern O
is O
the O
forecast O
that O
the O
elections O
for O
the O
renewal O
of O
all O
regional O
councils O
will O
be O
contextual O
with O
that O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
and O
be O
called O
by O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
. O

This O
, O
in O
the O
view O
of O
the O
presidents O
, O
would O
be O
a O
very O
strong O
injury O
to O
autonomy O
, O
because O
the O
discipline O
of O
the O
election O
of O
councils O
has O
always O
been O
the O
prerogative O
of O
regional O
laws O
and O
is O
guaranteed O
by O
the O
Statute O
as O
an O
essential O
element O
of O
specificity O
and O
autonomy O
. O

Before O
meeting O
the O
presidents O
, O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
will O
see O
the O
legist O
Sergio B-PER
Divina I-PER
. O

Between O
the O
two O
there O
is O
a O
friendship O
consolidated O
by O
many O
years O
of O
militancy O
in O
the O
Carroccio B-ORG
: O

The O
report O
was O
particularly O
frequent O
in O
the O
last O
election O
campaign O
in O
Trentino O
. O

The O
same O
Divine B-PER
will O
present O
a O
series O
of O
requests O
to O
Calderoli B-PER
, O
who O
curiously O
come O
very O
close O
to O
the O
proposals O
of O
the O
presidents O
of O
the O
regions O
. O

Among O
these O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
favourable O
opinion O
of O
the O
local O
authorities O
is O
always O
expected O
before O
making O
statutory O
changes O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
demand O
that O
any O
form O
of O
greater O
autonomy O
than O
today O
be O
extended O
not O
only O
to O
ordinary O
regions O
, O
but O
also O
to O
those O
with O
special O
status O
. O

Divine B-PER
does O
not O
hide O
the O
hope O
of O
bringing O
home O
a O
positive O
result O
: O

The O
proposals O
that O
I O
will O
present O
to O
the O
minister O
- O
he O
says O
- O
do O
not O
affect O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
reform O
law O
, O
but O
their O
acceptance O
could O
credit O
the O
League B-ORG
as O
a O
force O
that O
respects O
the O
autonomy O
, O
as O
well O
as O
changing O
the O
political O
orientation O
of O
large O
sections O
of O
the O
population O
. O

In O
a O
note O
, O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
Giacomo B-PER
Bezzi I-PER
, O
hopes O
that O
the O
verbal O
commitments O
made O
by O
the O
Minister O
will O
be O
followed O
by O
concrete O
initiatives O
. O

In O
the O
same O
document O
, O
the O
initiatives O
put O
in O
place O
to O
defend O
autonomy O
, O
starting O
from O

This O
is O
the O
comment O
of O
Vittorio B-PER
Emanuele I-PER
of I-PER
Savoia I-PER
on O
the O
constitutional O
reforms O
before O
Parliament B-ORG
. O

As O
for O
the O
economic O
situation O
, O
the O
belonging O
to O
the O
deposed O
and O
exiled O
royal O
house O
( O
the O
ban O
on O
returning O
to O
Italy B-LOC
has O
just O
been O
removed O
) O
after O
the O
fall O
of O
fascism O
, O
appears O
optimistic O
: O

We O
have O
and O
will O
always O
have O
the O
" O
star O
. O
" O

There O
is O
no O
problem O
, O
we O
will O
definitely O
be O
fine O
. O

Certainly O
the O
euro O
has O
given O
a O
very O
strong O
shock O
to O
salaries O
and O
prices O
but O
perhaps O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
see O
this O
thing O
first O
, O
which O
however O
has O
happened O
from O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

According O
to O
Vittorio B-PER
Emanuele I-PER
his O
experience O
in O
this O
Italian O
period O
taught O
him O
to O
be O
close O
to O
the O
people O
and O
with O
the O
people O
. O

After O
all O
the O
king O
is O
the O
representative O
of O
the O
people O
, O
he O
concluded O
, O
perhaps O
hiding O
among O
the O
words O
a O
singular O
claim O
to O
a O
throne O
that O
no O
longer O
exists O
for O
sixty O
years O
. O

The O
requests O
of O
the O
special O
self O
- O

CONTEXT O

The O
request O
is O
to O
eliminate O
the O
contextuality O
of O
the O

for O
the O

and O
the O

in O
1928 O
won O
by O
Major O
Urdareanu B-PER
, O
official O
of O
the O
Romanian O

, O
at O
the O
wheel O
of O
Fiat O
520 O
. O

From O
1961 O
, O
until O
last O
year O
, O
the O
race O
always O
maintained O
the O
worldwide O
validity O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
in O
the O
1990s O
it O
was O
also O
valid O
for O
Italian O
. O

The O
audience O
was O
offered O
a O
rare O
show O
: O

the O
opportunity O
to O
admire O
the O
evolutions O
of O
the O
big O
iridati O
flanked O
by O
the O
best O
drivers O
of O
the O
tricolor O

This O
year O
the O
event O
has O
been O
moved O
to O
Sardinia B-LOC

Sanremo O
remains O
in O
the O
calendar O
for O
the O
penultimate O
event O
of O
the O
Italian O

Championship O
. O

One O
stage O
, O
Saturday O
, O
and O

evidently O
shortened O
compared O
to O
the O

But O
remain O
the O
special O
historical O
, O
such O
as O
San O
Romolo O
, O
Monte O
Ceppo O
and O
Colle O

. O

For O
Renato B-PER
Travaglia I-PER
, O
who O
has O
been O
beaten O
back O
to O
the O
Adriatic O
, O
is O
the O
penultimate O
opportunity O
to O
take O
his O
206 O
Super O
1600 O
to O
the O
podium O
. O

The O
bottom O
, O
asphalt O
, O
would O
be O
ideal O
for O
this O
car O
. O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
Ligurian O
race O
has O
always O
given O
great O
satisfaction O
to O
the O
Trentino O
driver O
. O

So O
, O
is O
there O
feeling O
with O
the O
Sanremo O
? O
" O
It O
seems O
. O

In O
1993 O
, O
we O
conquered O
a O
splendid O
7th O
absolute O
. O

First O
group O
N O
with O
the O
Ford O
Escort O
Cosworth O
. O

The O
validity O
of O
the O
competition O
was O
global O
. O

A O
great O
satisfaction O
, O
since O
I O
then O
conquered O
my O
first O
Scudetto O
" O
. O

So O
, O
the O
debut O
with O
306 O
Maxi O
. O

" O
True O
, O
in O
' O
98 O
they O
made O
us O
try O
306 O
Maxi O
, O
with O
which O
I O
would O
compete O
the O
following O
year O
in O
the O
tricolor O
. O

It O
was O
imperative O
to O
get O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
race O
and O
we O
concluded O
thirds O
between O
the O
2RMs O
. O

But O
we O
took O
away O
the O
great O
satisfaction O
of O
detaching O
an O
absolute O
third O
time O
on O
Pantasina O
's O
special O
, O
where O
we O
put O
behind O
the O
WRCs O
of O
McRae B-PER
, O
Sainz B-PER
and O
Makinen B-PER
. O
" O

The O
following O
year O
Travaglia B-PER
dominates O
the O
tricolor O
and O
still O
participates O
in O
the O
Sanremo O
with O
the O

He O
makes O
the O
only O
mistake O
of O
the O

bangs O

is O
forced O
to O
retire O
when O

The O
contrast O

Prodi B-PER
- O
says O
Rutelli B-PER

right O

It O
is O
unsustainable O
for O
both O
the O
Dl B-ORG

the O

therefore O
needs O
to O
be O
resolved O

Gentiloni B-PER

I O

come O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
a O

the O
ideal O

Do O
they O

We O

start O
for O

- O
remember O
the O

, O
because O

The O

believed O
that O
this O

emotional O

too O
visual O

they O
said O
that O

not O

But O
we O
had O
no O

This O

Behind O

the O

" O
there O
is O
perhaps O
the O

It O

with O

Here O
: O

The O
goal O
is O
precisely O
to O
confirm O
itself O
at O

top O

to O
enrich O
your O
career O
with O
some O
medals O

I O

am O
physically O

still O

so O

hope O
to O
be O
able O
to O
start O

again O
properly O

with O

that O
you O
do O

you O
would O
n't O

I O
did O
it O
again O

I O
will O
do O
it O
again O

The O

the O

solicited O
by O

asked O

It O
meant O

But O
the O

said O
no O
, O
calling O
the O

" O

The O
fire O

up O

Giuseppe B-PER

who O
, O
examining O

had O
raised O
the O
suspicion O
that O
Juve B-ORG
had O
even O
used O
the O

D'Onofrio B-PER
: O

" O
The O

them O
: O

At O
a O

, O
in O
Bologna B-LOC
, O
you O
carried O
out O
an O
advice O
and O
arrived O
at O
completely O
different O
conclusions O

We O
do O
n't O
understand O
how O

did O
the O

Dr. O

" O
, O
he O

the O
interventions O
of O
Casalbore B-PER
: O

You O
do O

have O
to O

You O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
attack O
the O

In O
the O
end O
, O
Chiappero B-PER
concluded O
: O

You O
can O
denounce O
me O
, O
so O
at O
least O
I O
can O
defend O
myself O
and O
ask O
the O
questions O
I O
have O
to O

Then O
she O
took O
the O
floor O
at O
Agricola B-PER
: O

Any O

say O
anything O

But O
this O
is O
a O

not O

I O

leaving O

And O
, O
on O

the O

A O

on O
the O
productive O
activities O
that O
benefit O
from O

and O
that O
will O
serve O
to O
finance O
the O
fund O
many O
times O
announced O
by O
Councillor O
Tiziano B-PER
Mellarini I-PER
. O

Today O
, O
he O
assures O
the O
person O
concerned O
, O
" O
I O
will O
go O
and O
explain O
the O
proposal O
in O
joint O
. O

Of O
the O
three O
hypotheses O
still O
on O
the O
table O
for O
the O
fund O
, O
that O
of O
the O
new O
tourist O
tax O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
preferred O
one O
by O
Mellarini B-PER
. O

This O
will O
provide O
the O
necessary O
resources O
for O
the O
financing O
of O
the O
reformed O
Apts B-ORG
. O

The O
additional O
Irap O
( O
maximum O
1 O
% O
) O
if O
accepted O
by O
the O
junta B-ORG
will O
primarily O
affect O
those O
categories O
( O
restaurants O
and O
public O
establishments O
) O
which O
directly O
benefit O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
tourists O
. O

" O
Then O
we O
will O
assess O
- O
clarifies O
the O
city O
council O
member O
- O
whether O
to O
do O
so O
on O
other O
entities O
too O
" O
. O

The O
hypothesis O
that O
will O
follow O
the O
amendment O
of O
law O
8 O
is O
to O
make O
contribution O
also O
those O
, O
like O
artisans O
, O
profit O
more O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
vacationers O
. O

The O
package O
of O
amendments O
to O
Law O
8 O
also O
includes O
changes O
to O
the O
Pros B-ORG
loco I-ORG
and O
to O
the O
major O
events O
( O
e.g. O
the O
Melinda O
, O
the O
Marcialonga O
and O
the O
Psa O
) O
for O
which O
programming O
will O
go O
from O
annual O
to O
three O
years O
. O

Contrari O
they O
say O
the O
League B-ORG
with O
the O
councilman O
Denis B-PER
Bertolini I-PER
and O
the O
Lista B-ORG
Taverna I-ORG
. O

The O
latter O
calls O
for O
the O
junta B-ORG
to O
explain O
to O
us O
how O
the O
huge O
public O
resources O
( O
EUR O
100 O
million O
) O
available O
for O
promotion O
have O
been O
spent O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
before O
considering O
new O
taxation O
. O

Bertolini B-PER
defines O
taxation O
as O
" O
inconceivable O
" O
because O
" O
penalising O
tourism O
means O
penalising O
the O
entire O
provincial O
economy O
" O
. O

On O
the O
front O
of O
the O
categories O
, O
praised O
by O
Natale B-PER
Rigotti I-PER
, O
President O
of O
the O
Hoteliers B-ORG
, O
to O
the O
financing O
without O
which O
the O
Apts B-ORG
are O
not O
standing O
. O

On O
Irap O
and O
Ici O
on O
the O
second O
houses O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
start O
a O
table O
of O
comparison O
between O
all O
of O
them O
. O

Before O
judging O
I O
want O
to O
understand O
in O
detail O
the O
proposal O
- O
says O
Gianni B-PER
Bort I-PER
, O
President O
of O
the O
Trade B-ORG
Union I-ORG
- O

We O
have O
always O
asked O
that O
there O
should O
not O
be O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
rate O
, O
but O
that O
a O
share O
of O
a O
tax O
or O
generalized O
tax O
on O
the O
territory O
should O
be O
allocated O
to O
tourism O
. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
Artisans B-ORG
, O
Flavio B-PER
Tosi I-PER
says O
he O
is O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
principle O
that O
" O
who O
benefits O
from O
tourism O
must O
pay O
" O
, O
but O
it O
is O
at O
the O
same O
time O
contrary O
if O
it O
is O
a O
tax O
for O
everyone O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
for O
everyone O
to O
pay O
for O
one O
sector O
only O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
draw O
up O
criteria O
for O
a O
contribution O
differentiated O
according O
to O
the O
benefit O
derived O
from O
it O
. O

I O
also O
say O
that O
if O
the O
Trentino O
economy O
has O
to O
pay O
to O
support O
tourism O
, O
it O
would O
be O
right O
for O
the O
hoteliers O
to O
use O
the O
Trentino O
companies O
. O

close O

This O
was O
announced O
by O
the O
top O
management O
of O
the O
company O
, O
led O
by O
A.D. O
Paolo B-PER
Rossi I-PER
, O
during O
the O
meeting O
with O
the O
unions O
, O
held O
yesterday O
afternoon O
at O
the O
headquarters O
of O
Assindustria B-ORG
and O
aimed O
at O
defining O
the O
details O
for O
obtaining O
the O
extraordinary O
integration O
fund O
for O
workers O
. O

Today O
's O
meeting O
is O
certainly O
a O
good O
step O
forward O
- O
says O
Stefano B-PER
Montani I-PER
, O
of O
the O
Cgil B-ORG
- O
The O
company O
has O
guaranteed O
its O
availability O
for O
the O
integration O
fund O
and O
has O
said O
it O
is O
ready O
to O
anticipate O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Tfr O
for O
the O
workers O
, O
to O
reduce O
the O
economic O
inconveniences O
. O

The O
confirmation O
of O
the O
closure O
at O
the O
end O
of O
February O
, O
moreover O
- O
adds O
Montani B-PER
- O
is O
certainly O
a O
positive O
figure O
, O
they O
are O
two O
months O
earned O
compared O
to O
the O
expected O
" O
. O

The O
plan O
that O
is O
being O
developed O
to O
obtain O
the O
grant O
of O
the O
Extraordinary O
Integration O
Fund O
, O
which O
presupposes O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
replacement O
activity O
, O
should O
include O
the O
intervention O
of O
more O
than O
one O
company O
. O

According O
to O
a O
first O
working O
hypothesis O
, O
all O
to O
be O
verified O
, O
about O
twenty O
employees O
could O
be O
absorbed O
by O
Unifarm B-ORG
, O
which O
, O
only O
to O
do O
it O
officially O
, O
has O
already O
manifested O
its O
interest O
. O

Someone O
more O
, O
between O
20 O
and O
30 O
, O
should O
pass O
in O
force O
to O
a O
second O
company O
, O
with O
which O
the O
negotiations O
are O
still O
under O
way O
, O
conducted O
however O
not O
by O
Lesffre B-ORG
Italy I-ORG
, O
but O
directly O
by O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
hypothesis O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Cavit B-ORG
also O
recurs O
, O
although O
officially O
no O
one O
has O
come O
out O
of O
the O
open O
: O

" O
We O
are O
assessing O
the O
viability O
of O
this O
option O
, O
but O
without O
commitment O
to O
staff O
" O
, O
let O
the O
Consortium B-ORG
's O
top O
management O
know O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
some O
managers O
will O
move O
to O
the O
Parma B-LOC
plant O
, O
while O
22 O
positions O
will O
be O
resolved O
by O
the O
use O
of O

and O
the O

With O
these O
numbers O
, O
he O
assures O
the O
Councillor O
for O

Marco B-PER
Benedetti I-PER
, O
I O
see O
no O
major O
problems O
for O
the O
cashier O

While O

the O

Alessandra B-PER
Degasperi I-PER

Ivonne B-PER
Demozzi I-PER
do O
n't O
forget O
. O

The O
two O
promoters O
of O
an O
assembly O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
protection O
of O
the O
beauty O
and O
the O
peculiarity O
of O
the O
ancient O
street O
, O
met O
yesterday O
the O
city O
council O
member O
for O
public O
works O
, O
Andrea B-PER
Rudari I-PER
. O

There O
were O
also O
two O
technicians O
of O
the O
municipality B-LOC
and O
the O
president O
of O
the O
circuit O
, O
Alessandro B-PER
Depedri I-PER
. O

In O
the O
meeting O
it O
emerged O
the O
precise O
will O
of O
the O
technicians O
and O
Depedri B-PER
to O
guarantee O
first O
of O
all O
the O
safety O
and O
to O
favor O
a O
functional O
roadway O
guaranteeing O
the O
easy O
passage O
to O
eventual O
means O
of O
rescue O
. O

" O
Rudari B-PER
, O
" O
said O
Mrs O
Degasperi B-PER
, O
" O
was O
very O
understanding O
and O
willing O
to O
find O
a O
solution O
that O
could O
meet O
our O
expectations O
. O
" O

The O
technicians O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
argued O
that O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
grate O
was O
also O
supported O
by O
the O
mountain O
basins O
, O
which O
declared O
themselves O
opposed O
to O
the O
possibility O
of O
touching O
the O
beehive O
of O
the O
roar O
for O
the O
realization O
of O
a O
sort O
of O
step O
. O

But O
what O
was O
less O
pleasing O
was O
the O
firm O
will O
of O
the O
president O
of O
the O
constituency B-LOC
to O
cover O
the O
road O
with O
a O
thank O
you O
without O
proving O
willing O
to O
find O
other O
solutions O
. O

We O
are O
convinced O
- O
said O
Alessandra B-PER
Degasperi I-PER
- O
that O
the O
most O
serious O
closure O
is O
precisely O
in O
the O
circumscription B-ORG
council I-ORG
of O
Sardagna B-LOC
. O

We O
believe O
that O
the O
constituency B-LOC
itself O
should O
carefully O
consider O
serious O
rethinking O
and O
seek O
new O
, O
more O
satisfactory O
solutions O
because O
the O
road O
is O
close O
to O
many O
residents O
. O

We O
will O
therefore O
urge O
the O
three O
advisers O
who O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
confront O
us O
in O
the O
public O
assembly O
( O
B. B-PER
Berloffa I-PER
, O
G. B-PER
Zambelli I-PER
and O
R. B-PER
Degasperi I-PER
) O
to O
request O
the O
President O
to O
put O
the O
matter O
on O
the O
agenda O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
on O
the O
circumscription O
council O

spoke O
directly O
with O
the O
engineer O
responsible O

who O
confirmed O
their O
willingness O
to O
find O

He O
knows O
Trentino B-LOC
well O
. O

He O
worked O
at O
the O
Faculty B-ORG
of I-ORG
Sociology I-ORG
in O
Trento B-LOC
from O
1968 O
to O
1997 O
, O
also O
as O
director O
of O
the O

of I-ORG

He O
was O
then O
principal O
of O
the O

Faculty B-ORG
from O
1993 O
to O
1996 O
( O
one O
year O
he O

. O

Professor O
Schizzerotto B-PER
, O
has O
the O
political O
representation O
of O
Trentino O
slipped O
into O
the O
same O
crisis O
that O
is O
destroying O
the O
Italian O
political O
system O
? O

Trentino B-LOC
has O
not O
been O
exempt O
from O
national O
dynamics O
. O

The O
DC B-ORG
has O
fragmented O
: O

Daisy B-ORG
, O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
and O
other O
components O
of O
the O
galaxy O
. O

The O
Socialists O
have O
virtually O
disappeared O
... O

And O
here O
is O
the O
autonomous O
current O
that O
is O
part O
of O
the O
local O
political O
genome O
. O

But O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
local O
central O
- O
left O
governments O
here O
have O
a O
greater O
institutional O
hold O
. O

Greater O
control O
of O
the O
administrative O
machine O
. O

Perhaps O
, O
in O
reality O
, O
we O
can O
talk O
about O
a O
greater O
estate O
of O
the O
Trentino O
community O
, O
which O
has O
a O
higher O
level O
of O
solidarity O
and O
a O
better O
average O
rigour O
of O
relationship O
with O
the O
institutions O
. O

Here O
, O
in O
short O
, O
it O
's O
better O
than O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
. O

If O
the O
political O
structure O
in O
any O
way O
holds O
itself O
, O
can O
it O
hold O
that O
of O
the O
social O
state O
, O
the O
overall O
level O
of O
services O
, O
given O
the O
attacks O
on O
the O
autonomy O
of O
Trentino O
coming O
from O
Rome B-LOC
and O
its O
abnormal O
wealth O
in O
terms O
of O
financial O
resources O
? O

The O
overall O
layout O
of O
the O
local O
welfare O
system O
, O
which O
includes O
all O
transfers O
( O
unemployment O
, O
poverty O
, O
disability O
, O
health O
, O
educational O
and O
school O
services O
) O
, O
beyond O
a O
number O
of O
necessary O
adjustments O
, O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
it O
still O
works O
well O
. O

There O
is O
a O
picture O
of O
massive O
aid O
that O
comes O
to O
the O
citizen O
. O

Yet O
Istat B-ORG
statistics O
have O
spoken O
of O
new O
poverty O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
it O
seemed O
that O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
poverty O
levels O
were O
rising O
( O
which O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
) O
is O
because O
consumption O
is O
low O
. O

But O
this O
depends O
on O
the O
preferred O
tariff O
system O
, O
due O
to O
the O
intervention O
of O
the O
public O
administration O
. O

Trentinos O
spend O
little O
on O
transport O
, O
school O
and O
health O
. O

The O
Welfare O
system O
covers O
a O
number O
of O
services O
that O
are O
paid O
by O
citizens O
elsewhere O
. O

Think O
of O
the O
convenient O
textbooks O
in O
the O
schools O
of O
obligation O
, O
a O
great O
saving O
for O
families O
.. O

Yeah O
, O
public O
rates O
. O

A O
half O
- O
revolution O
for O
the O
proposal O
to O
bring O
to O
a O
euro O
the O
bus O
ticket O
to O
Trento B-LOC
. O

( O
Dr. O
Schizzerotto B-PER
smiles O
) O

The O
Milan O
metro O
ticket O
costs O
more O
than O
one O
euro O
and O
is O
valid O
for O
less O
time O
. O

Here O
the O
provincial O
administration O
makes O
use O
of O
a O
public O
budget O
that O
is O
among O
the O
highest O
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O

The O
Lombardy B-LOC
Region I-LOC
and O
the O
City B-LOC
of I-LOC
Milan I-LOC
are O
not O
poor O
entities O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
however O
, O
the O
public O
contribution O
to O
the O
per O
capita O
budget O
is O
more O
substantial O
here O
. O

Then O
the O
question O
is O
: O

Is O
public O
money O
invested O
properly O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
? O

My O
feeling O
is O
that O
there O
is O
a O
very O
high O
level O
of O
legitimacy O
of O
the O
local O
administration O
which O
has O
shown O
that O
it O
administers O
wisely O
. O

It O
's O
perfectible O
. O

Trentino B-LOC
should O
refer O
to O
Central O
and O
Northern O
Europe O
and O
not O
constantly O
confront O
the O
rest O
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O

Professor O
Schizzerotto B-PER
, O
when O
the O
provincial O
structure O
is O
preparing O
to O
define O
the O
new O
annual O
budget O
, O
dozens O
of O
allocations O
rush O
to O
spend O
sums O
, O
even O
large O
, O
for O
the O
sole O
reason O
of O
not O
seeing O
the O
funds O
cut O
for O
the O
following O
year O
... O

I O
say O
that O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
Italian O
context O
the O
overall O
system O
has O
strong O
points O
of O
legitimacy O
. O

I O
see O
no O
relevant O
examples O
of O
waste O
of O
public O
money O
. O

There O
are O
strong O
signs O
of O
wise O
use O
of O
public O
money O
. O

So O
autonomy O
is O
legitimate O
. O

Why O
take O
it O
off O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
? O

Rather O
we O
see O
that O
similar O
levels O
of O
autonomy O
are O
developing O
in O
the O
national O
field O
. O

But O
that O
does O
n't O
mean O
that O
citizens O
have O
to O
expect O
everything O
for O
free O
. O

In O
a O
situation O
of O
reduced O
economic O
development O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
public O
administration O
can O
not O
continue O
to O
support O
all O
the O
needs O
of O
each O
individual O
citizen O
. O

There O
is O
a O
need O
to O
call O
for O
a O
reduction O
in O
facilities O
, O
commensurate O
with O
the O
economic O
capacity O
of O
households O
. O

The O
bus O
ticket O
from O
0.90 O
to O
1 O
euro O
created O
apprehensions O
and O
protests O
. O

Excessive O
. O

The O
attempt O
to O
raise O
tariffs O
is O
reasonable O
. O

Better O
for O
the O
private O
to O
pay O
a O
little O
more O
, O
than O
for O
the O
public O
service O
to O
go O
into O
crisis O
. O

The O
generality O
of O
the O
Trentinos O
must O
realize O
that O
we O
are O
experiencing O
a O
less O
favourable O
economic O
situation O
than O
10 O
years O
ago O
. O

And O
some O
more O
cost O
the O
private O
has O
to O
hire O
it O
if O
you O
want O
the O
public O
administration O
to O
continue O
to O
be O
reasonably O
fair O
and O
efficient O
. O

After O
these O
declarations O
of O
love O
, O
can O
you O
indicate O
any O
vice O
of O
the O
Trentino O
system O
? O

There O
are O
elements O
of O
widespread O
negativity O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

Trentinos O
love O
to O
affirm O
their O
diversity O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
. O

It O
would O
be O
time O
for O
them O
to O
start O
confronting O
Europe B-LOC
, O
with O
the O
best O
of O
Europe B-LOC
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
sometimes O
prefer O
a O
provincial O
defensive O
closure O
. O

The O
call O
to O
diversity O
must O
be O
propulsive O
and O
not O
defensive O
. O

But O
there O
is O
also O
another O
, O
more O
specific O
, O
criticism O
that O
can O
be O
done O
to O
the O
reality O
of O
Trentino O
. O

I O
am O
referring O
to O
investment O
in O
education O
. O

Despite O
the O
efforts O
of O
the O
public O
administration O
and O
despite O
the O
growing O
reputation O
of O
the O
University O
of O
Trentino O
, O
private O
investment O
in O
education O
is O
still O
low O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
families O
still O
do O
n't O
invest O
much O
in O
education O
. O

In O
Trentino B-LOC
there O
is O
still O
little O
study O
. O

children O

not O
have O
alarmed O
parents O
: O

The O
teacher O
has O
rightly O
used O
technical O
terms O
to O
explain O
how O
reproduction O
works O
. O

These O
are O
terms O
that O
can O
be O
found O
in O
all O
the O
sex O

books O
dedicated O
to O
the O

ones O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
tensions O
between O
the O
teacher O
and O
some O
families O
are O
dated O
. O

According O
to O
Baldo B-PER
sometimes O
the O
teacher O
has O
not O
been O
appreciated O
because O
she O
is O
direct O
. O

But O
the O
working O
method O
- O
he O
adds O
- O
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
class O
is O
very O
lively O
, O
but O
she O
knows O
how O
to O
hold O
it O
. O

Then O
comes O
the O
criticism O
to O
the O
school O
leadership O
, O
which O
has O
not O
properly O
informed O
the O
parents O
. O

" O
Nobody O
- O
he O
says O
- O
has O
explained O
to O
us O
what O
are O
the O
reasons O
for O
this O
departure O

" O

It O
is O
the O

that O
a O

is O
made O
on O
this O

a O
" O

" O
( O
the O

) O
has O
been O

the O

has O
been O
the O
spark O
from O
which O
everything O
has O
sprung O

To O
the O

N.D. B-PER

only O
contests O
that O

Maybe O
behind O

is O
also O
its O
poor O

For O
sure O
children O
will O
be O
affected O

this O
climate O
: O

those O

not O
taking O

a O

IL O
VERTICE O
DA O
CALDEROLI B-PER
- O
This O
is O
what O
was O
communicated O
yesterday O
by O
the O
Minister O
for O
Reforms O
Roberto B-PER
Calderoli I-PER
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Provinces B-LOC
and O
the O
Special O
Regions O
, O
who O
came O
to O
Rome B-LOC
to O
ask O
for O
institutional O
guarantees O
against O
the O
special O
autonomy O
. O

The O
meeting O
was O
attended O
by O
the O
presidents O
of O
the O
Provinces O
of O
Trento B-LOC
and O
Bolzano B-LOC
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
and O
Luis B-PER
Durnwalder I-PER
, O
the O

Mario B-PER
Magnani I-PER
, O
and O
the O

Giacomo B-PER

Mr O
Calderoli B-PER
, O
while O
reaffirming O
his O
personal O
conviction O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
positions O
of O
the O
special O
self O
- O
governments O
, O
opposed O
the O
majority O

condemnation O
of O
the O

. O

" O
There O
is O
a O
majority O
agreement O
, O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
back O
, O
" O
he O
told O
the O
representatives O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

I O
accept O
all O
your O
requests O
and O
will O
bring O
them O
to O
the O
examination O
of O
the O
majority O
, O
but O
I O
can O
not O
make O
specific O
commitments O
on O
these O
points O
. O

THE O
16 O
SEPTEMBER O
IN O
AULA O
- O
The O
examination O
of O
the O
bill O
is O
expected O
to O
arrive O
in O
court O
from O
16 O
September O
to O
8 O
October O
. O

" O
It O
is O
paradoxical O
that O
a O
constitutional O
reform O
born O
for O
federalism O
, O
risks O
reducing O
the O
autonomy O
that O
is O
already O
guaranteed O
to O
the O
Regions O
and O
Provinces O
under O
special O
statute O
" O
, O
commented O
President O
Dellai B-PER
, O
who O
just O
left O
the O
summit O
with O
Calderoli B-PER
. O

This O
bill O
has O
a O
radical O
impact O
on O
the O
constitutional O
foundations O
of O
our O
legal O
systems O
. O

We O
ca O
n't O
just O
stand O
by O
and O
watch O
it O
. O

The O
comments O
made O
by O
Presidents O
Magnani B-PER
and O
Bezzi B-PER
also O
last O
. O

" O
The O
meeting O
went O
wrong O
" O
, O
said O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Council B-ORG
. O

And O
Magnani B-PER
added O
: O

They O
want O
to O
bring O
home O
the O
federalism O
law O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
much O
interest O
in O
Trentino B-LOC

CLAUSE O
OF O
BEST O
WELCOME O
- O
The O
only O
point O
on O
which O
Minister O
Calderoli B-PER
gave O
assurances O
was O
that O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
best O
favour O
clause O
" O
. O

The O
novelties O
of O
federalism O
reform O
will O
only O
apply O
to O
special O
self O
- O
governments O
if O
they O
improve O
on O
what O
they O
already O
have O
. O

However O
, O
this O
was O
immediately O
reduced O
by O
Calderoli B-PER
when O
he O
reiterated O
that O
the O
principle O
of O
national O
interest O
, O
which O
also O
applies O
to O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
still O
remains O
in O
force O
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
federal B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
could O
cancel O
autonomous O
laws O
in O
the O
name O
of O
national O
interest O
, O
a O
rather O
general O
concept O
. O

" O
The O
Senate B-ORG
is O
a O
political O
body O
, O
" O
Dellai B-PER
immediately O
objected O
. O

This O
means O
that O
our O
laws O
will O
be O
judged O
by O
a O
political O
body O
. O

THE O
MINISTR O
IS O
OF O
AGREEMENT O
, O
THE O
GOVERNMENT O
NO O
- O
Several O
times O
the O
minister O
has O
stated O
that O
, O
if O
it O
were O
for O
him O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
national O
interest O
would O
not O
even O
have O
taken O
it O
into O
account O
. O

" O
But O
the O
majority O
agreement O
provides O
for O
it O
" O
, O
he O
added O
. O

And O
I O
ca O
n't O
do O
anything O
about O
it O
. O

Even O
on O
this O
point O
, O
the O
minister O
did O
not O
give O
certain O
answers O
. O

The O
request O
of O
the O
autonomouss O
was O
to O
have O
equal O
representation O
in O
the O
new O
federal B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
. O

Calderoli B-PER
has O
postponed O
everything O
to O
a O
new O
model O
that O
is O
being O
developed O
, O
and O
of O
which O
the O
contours O
are O
not O
yet O

trouble O

how O

They O
are O
the O
beauty O
of O

, O
more O
or O
less O
what O
the O
city B-ORG
council I-ORG
does O
in O
a O
year O
. O

unthinkable O
. O

For O
the O
moment O
the O
council B-ORG
was O
extended O
until O
next O
Wednesday O
. O

Even O
with O
Raoul B-PER
Pontalti I-PER
there O
is O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
possible O
pact O
. O

The O
thing O
that O
is O
most O
interested O
to O
the O
National B-ORG
Alliance I-ORG
councilman O
is O
the O
identification O
of O
an O
appropriate O
area O
for O
the O
municipal O
kennel O
, O
which O
will O
have O
to O
move O
between O
not O
much O
from O
Sembenotti O
farm O
, O
destined O
to O
be O
razed O
to O
the O
ground O
to O
make O
room O
for O
the O
new O
junction O
along O
the O
ring O
road O
. O

This O
variant O
has O
so O
far O
not O
indicated O
any O
alternative O
. O

Andreatta B-PER
recently O
declared O
his O
willingness O
to O
re O
- O
propose O
the O
former O
farm O
in O
Camparta B-LOC
, O
which O
in O
the O
past O
had O
been O
discarded O
because O
it O
was O
too O
decentralized O
. O

Pontalti B-PER
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
opposed O
and O
insists O
on O
a O
solution O
in O
the O
valley O
floor O
. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
understood O
whether O
there O
are O
margins O
of O
bargaining O
with O
the O
legist O
Giuseppe B-PER
Filippin I-PER
. O

Yesterday O
the O
city O
council O
member O
tried O
several O
times O
to O
establish O
a O
contact O
. O

No O
use O
. O

Nailed O
to O
his O
scranno O
during O
the O
council O
even O
sent O
him O
a O
text O
message O
, O
proposing O
a O
meeting O
for O
this O
afternoon O
. O

Filippin B-PER
, O
however O
, O
for O
the O
moment O
seems O
intent O
to O
hold O
on O
: O

" O
We O
are O
at O
the O
point O
of O
no O
return O
, O
" O
he O
says O
, O
" O
and O
if O
I O
have O
to O
lose O
face O
I O
prefer O
to O
do O
it O
in O
the O
courtroom O
. O
" O

Meanwhile O
the O
discussion O
went O
on O
without O
big O
whispers O
but O
with O
some O
surprise O
. O

Leo B-PER
Vilardi I-PER
, O
for O
example O
, O
while O
referring O
to O
a O
coalition O
discipline O
that O
decides O
by O
majority O
, O
wanted O
to O
keep O
the O
center O
left O
on O
the O
rope O
by O
postponing O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
debate O
the O
decision O
on O
the O
vote O
of O
Social B-ORG
Comparison I-ORG
. O

Its O
main O
concern O
is O
that O
, O
through O
its O
comments O
and O
amendments O
, O
the O
variant O
risks O
transforming O
into O
conclusions O
other O
than O
those O
envisaged O
. O

The O
autonomousist O
Alberto B-PER
Pattini I-PER
praised O
the O
climate O
and O
the O
spirit O
with O
which O
the O
urban B-ORG
commission I-ORG
has O
worked O
in O
recent O
months O
on O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
variant O
and O
has O
focused O
on O
the O
excellent O
work O
done O
by O
the O
offices O
to O
put O
under O
protection O
a O
series O
of O
historical O
buildings O
of O
the O
early O
twentieth O
century O
architecturally O
worthy O
of O
note O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
insisting O
that O
a O
different O
solution O
be O
found O
for O
the O
Steineriana O
school O
, O
the O
green O
Aldo B-PER
Pompermaier I-PER
has O
focused O
on O
the O
areas O
for O
the O
facilitated O
building O
. O

That O
of O
Vela B-LOC
does O
not O
convince O
him O
fully O
and O
awaits O
the O
specific O
studies O
but O
regrets O
also O
for O
the O
missed O
occasions O
in O
the O
past O
: O

In O
Canova B-LOC
there O
will O
be O
600 O
accommodations O
, O
there O
was O
all O
the O
possibility O
of O

about O
fifty O
for O

. O

Finally O
Sergio B-PER
Cappelletti I-PER
, O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
pointed O
out O
some O
technical O
aspects O
hoping O
for O
the O
modification O
of O
the O
norm O
of O
the O
attic O
, O
removing O
the O
references O
to O

to O
leave O
full O
freedom O
of O

comments O
heavily O
on O
yesterday O

meeting O

" O
We O
welcome O
the O
Minister O

stated O
willingness O
to O
verify O
the O
precise O

made O
by O
institutional O
representatives O

status O

within O
the O
majority O

However O
, O
I O
can O
not O
accept O
- O
adds O
Bezzi B-PER
- O
that O
important O
concerns O
remain O
. O

" O
The O
reform O
of O
the O
League B-ORG
- O
continues O
- O
calls O
into O
question O
some O
fundamental O
elements O
of O
our O
autonomous O
prerogatives O
which O
, O
it O
is O
worth O
remembering O
, O
besides O
the O
constitutional O
importance O
make O
use O
of O
precise O
guarantees O
deriving O
from O
international O
treaties O
" O
. O

We O
will O
therefore O
follow O
very O
carefully O
in O
the O
next O
few O
days O
the O
evolution O
of O
political O
and O
parliamentary O
events O
on O
this O
issue O
- O
concludes O
Bezzi B-PER

, O
which O
represents O
a O
fundamental O
and O
indispensable O
interest O
of O
our O
peoples O

Also O
hard O
judgment O
of O
the O
president O
of O

In O
words O
there O
is O
a O
great O
willingness O
to O
resolve O
the O
issue O

In O
fact O

however O
, O
at O
the O
request O
of O
specific O
commitments O
, O
ministers O
Calderoli B-PER
and O
La B-PER

replied O
that O
we O
can O
not O
, O
because O
in O
the O
majority O
there O
are O
many O
against O
, O
says O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Regional B-ORG
Council I-ORG
. O

I O
am O
puzzled O
that O
a O
concrete O
solution O
can O
be O
found O
. O

My O
impression O
is O
that O
in O
Rome B-LOC
we O
want O
to O
bring O
home O
this O
reform O
at O
all O
costs O
, O
beyond O
how O
much O
it O
can O
affect O
Trentino B-LOC

In O
fact O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
does O
n't O
interest O
much O
. O

And O
this O
is O
in O
a O
delicate O
passage O
of O
our O
autonomy O
, O
in O
which O
the O
concentric O
attack O
of O
a O

so O

that O
it O
would O
be O
taken O
up O
immediately O
by O
the O
many O

took O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
for O
the O
translation O

the O
appeal O

came O
out O

sometimes O
also O
the O
name O
of O

always O
to O
demonize O
its O

the O
road O
in O
the O
ring O
road O
, O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
Bonomelli O
Opera O
. O

The O
man O
was O
rescued O
by O
an O
ambulance O
of O
118 B-ORG
and O
transported O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

His O
condition O
immediately O
seemed O
serious O
. O

In O
the O
shock O
he O
had O
suffered O
a O
head O
trauma O
and O
other O
contusions O
. O

Doctors O
have O
reserved O
their O
prognosis O
, O
even O
if O
they O
believe O
that O
man O
is O
not O
in O
danger O
of O
life O
. O

The O
man O
was O
crossing O
the O
ring O
road O
on O
foot O
probably O
to O
go O
to O
the O
nearby O
Opera O
Bonomelli O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
see O
a O
car O
coming O
from O
the O
north O
. O

The O
impact O
was O
impossible O
to O
avoid O
. O

At O
the O
wheel O
of O
the O
cars O
there O
was O
a O
woman O
who O
could O
see O
the O
man O
only O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
. O

Every O
attempt O
at O
braking O
has O
been O
in O
vain O
. O

The O
car O
hit O
the O
Pole O
and O
jumped O
him O
away O
. O

Fortunately O
the O
car O
had O
slowed O
down O
long O
before O
the O
crash O
, O
otherwise O
the O
consequences O
would O
have O
been O
heavier O
. O

The O
woman O
told O
the O
city O
police O
that O
she O
did O
n't O
see O
the O
man O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O
until O
the O
last O
moment O
. O

So O
the O
car O
hit O
the O
poor O
guy O
. O

On O
the O
spot O
immediately O
arrived O
the O
city O
policemen O
who O
also O
provided O
roadwork O
. O

The O
hit O
man O
was O
rescued O
by O
an O
ambulance O
that O
immediately O
took O
him O
to O
Santa O
Chiara O
Hospital O
. O

The O
man O
has O
been O
treated O
by O
first B-ORG
aid I-ORG
doctors O
who O
have O
detected O
numerous O
traumas O
. O

The O
man O
was O
still O
conscious O
. O

That O
's O
why O
doctors O
think O
he O
's O
not O
in O
danger O
of O
life O
. O

However O
its O
conditions O
do O
not O
allow O
to O
dissolve O
the O
prognosis O

could O
somehow O

" O
We O

On O

on O
the O

, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
solution O
can O
certainly O
be O
found O
. O

There O
is O
still O
some O
reflection O
to O
be O
made O
on O
two O
or O
three O
points O
. O

But O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
amendment O
which O
seeks O
to O
equate O
regions O
with O
regions O
with O
ordinary O
ones O
will O
certainly O
be O
deleted O
. O

we O
went O
a O

further O

that O

we O

until O

in O
many O
events O
of O
this O
type O
, O
the O
investigators O
were O
before O
the O
word O
of O
him O
against O
that O
of O
her O
. O

A O
case O
made O
even O
more O
difficult O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
woman O
had O
reported O
three O
weeks O
late O
. O

The O
24 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
girl O
from O
Pergine B-LOC
, O
assisted O
yesterday O
by O
lawyers O
Ivo B-PER
Dario I-PER
Gerola I-PER
and O
Maurizio B-PER
Pellegrioni I-PER
, O
told O
that O
she O
was O
stuck O
in O
the O
car O
after O
the O
immigrant O
had O
parked O
in O
an O
unlit O
area O
. O

The O
man O
would O
then O
grope O
the O
poor O
girl O
and O
then O
masturbate O
. O

The O
suspect O
replied O
that O
he O
had O
limited O
himself O
to O
accompanying O
the O
young O
woman O
home O
after O
an O
evening O
at O
the O
discotheque O
. O

The O
episode O
dates O
back O
to O
March O
28 O
, O
2004 O
. O

That O
night O
the O
two O
, O
who O
already O
knew O
each O
other O
because O
she O
had O
been O
a O
Tunisian O
friend O
's O
girlfriend O
, O
had O
been O
in O
a O
discotheque O
. O

Late O
at O
night O
the O
man O
offered O
to O
bring O
the O
girl O
home O
. O

She O
had O
accepted O
without O
suspecting O
the O
real O
intentions O
of O
what O
was O
to O
be O
a O
friend O
. O

After O
the O
violence O
, O
for O
weeks O
he O
had O
thought O
about O
what O
happened O
, O
undecided O
about O
what O
to O
do O
. O

The O
right O
decision O
, O
i.e. O
to O
file O
a O
complaint O
with O
the O
Carabinieri B-ORG
, O
was O
only O
made O
after O
20 O
days O
. O

The O
time O
spent O
, O
however O
, O
risked O
making O
vain O
the O
investigations O
of O
the O
carabinieri O
who O
, O
however O
, O
were O
able O
to O
trace O
organic O
traces O
on O
the O
Y10 O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
suspect O
defended O
himself O
claiming O
that O
he O
never O
even O
touched O
the O
woman O
. O

The O
pm O
Paolo B-PER
Storari I-PER
ordered O
the O
DNA O
test O
on O
the O
spot O
identified O
by O
the O
carabinieri O
on O
the O
car O
seats O
. O

to O
the O
Veronese O
coroner O
Anna B-PER
Caenazzo I-PER
. O

The O
doctor O
cut O
out O
a O
piece O
of O
fabric O
from O
the O
seat O
. O

The O
next O
exams O
gave O
a O
hard O
blow O
to O
the O
Tunisian O
's O
credibility O
: O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
spot O
was O
of O
semen O
, O
perfectly O
compatible O
with O
Ahmed B-PER
Mahalouthi I-PER
's O
DNA O
. O

And O
so O
yesterday O
we O
arrived O
at O
a O
sentence O
of O
2 O
years O
and O
8 O
months O
accompanied O
by O
an O
expulsion O
order O
. O

A O
heavy O
hand O
therefore O
, O
perhaps O
also O
because O
the O
accused O
did O
not O
give O
the O
slightest O
sign O
of O
repentance O
. O

What O
's O
new O
? O

One O
day O
a O

there O

be O

who O
can O
tell O

Our O
idea O
- O
says O
Rita B-PER

is O
to O
open O

In O
which O
the O
public O

Actually O
, O
just O
normal O
, O

will O
not O

We O
have O
decided O
- O
Rita B-PER
admits O
- O
to O
make O

on O
certain O
days O
of O
the O

it O
is O
predictable O

: O

" O
It O
would O
be O
a O
bad O
race O
, O
" O
he O
admits O
. O

Last O
night O
he O
spoke O
at O
a O
meeting O
in O
Aldeno B-LOC
: O

" O
I O
'm O
here O
to O
listen O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

He O
agrees O
with O
those O
who O
claim O
that O
in O
Ossetia B-LOC
we O
have O
reached O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
results O
. O

And O
, O
above O
all O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
get O
too O
unbalanced O
because O
I O
've O
tried O
to O
inform O
myself O
, O
but O
there O
are O
even O
more O
question O
marks O
than O
answers O
. O

But O
of O
one O
thing O
Lotti B-PER
is O
sure O
: O

I O
can O
not O
believe O
that O
in O
this O
Russia B-LOC
, O
in O
Putin B-PER
's O
Russia O
, O
there O
was O
no O
move O
without O
a O
presidential O
order O
. O

The O
negotiations O
, O
negotiations O
, O
in O
short O
, O
should O
have O
continued O
. O

But O
is O
n't O
there O
a O
risk O
of O
legitimizing O
the O
demands O
of O
any O
extremist O
group O
? O

No O
to O
terrorism O
must O
be O
clear O
, O
clean O
and O
total O
. O

But O
it O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
understand O
that O
there O
is O
not O
only O
one O
: O

There O
are O
several O
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
understand O
what O
kind O
of O
response O
to O
each O
one O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
regions O
for O
which O
he O
was O
born O
. O

Terrorism O
, O
moreover O
, O
is O
a O
degenerative O
phenomenon O
. O

What O
terrorism O
is O
that O
Chechen O
? O

It O
finds O
its O
roots O
in O
the O
failure O
to O
accept O
requests O
for O
greater O
autonomy O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the O
Soviet B-LOC
Union I-LOC
. O

It O
is O
born O
, O
like O
the O
others O
, O
from O
an O
unsolved O
problem O
: O

You O
have O
to O
figure O
out O
which O
one O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
it O
is O
necessary O
that O
the O
Russian O
regime O
, O
unfortunately O
I O
am O
forced O
to O
define O
it O
so O
because O
of O
the O
violations O
and O
the O
serious O
crimes O
that O
have O
been O
committed O
, O
bring O
the O
negotiation O
back O
to O
the O
center O
of O
the O
debate O
as O
the O
Chechen O
population O
demands O
. O

Terrorism O
is O
born O
in O
conditions O
of O
total O
desperation O
and O
the O
rejection O
of O
Putin B-PER
's O
dialogue O
with O
the O
political O
component O
has O
strengthened O
the O
extremist O
fringe O
. O

But O
we O
are O
also O
talking O
about O
the O
presence O
of O
Arabs O
and O
links O
with O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
... O

In O
my O
opinion O
there O
is O
a O
simplification O
in O
the O
rhetoric O
of O
communication O
: O

We O
wait O
for O
confirmation O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
Arabs O
. O

Besides O
, O
this O
does O
n't O
mean O
the O
involvement O
of O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
. O

I O
repeat O
: O

There O
are O
different O
terrorisms O
for O
different O
purposes O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Iraq B-LOC
was O
struck O
by O
Bin B-PER
Laden I-PER
, O
but O
Saddam B-PER
had O
interests O
opposite O
those O
of O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
. O

Thousands O
of O
miles O
away O
, O
what O
can O
sensitive O
citizens O
do O
to O
encourage O
new O
approaches O
? O

The O
massacres O
like O
those O
of O
Beslan B-LOC
, O
but O
not O
only O
, O
can O
never O
be O
justified O
. O

Having O
said O
that O
, O
there O
must O
be O
a O
collective O
commitment O
to O
place O
the O
rights O
, O
values O
and O
dignity O
of O
each O
population O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
attention O
. O

Also O
because O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
those O
who O
do O
not O
enter O
always O
die O
... O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
there O
is O
always O
someone O
willing O
to O
finance O
the O
mess O
and O
from O
every O
conflict O
tries O
to O
benefit O
: O

in O
Chechnya B-LOC
as O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
or O
in O
the O
African O
region O
of O
the O
great B-LOC
lakes I-LOC
. O

Concretely O
, O
then O
, O
what O
should O
you O
do O
? O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
are O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
the O
law O
of O
the O
jungle O
and O
not O
of O
international O
law O
is O
in O
place O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
Chechen O
question O
must O
be O
brought O
to O
the O
one O
common O
home O
that O
has O
humanity O
, O
the O
UN B-ORG
. O

The O
united B-ORG
nations I-ORG
, O
despite O
all O
the O
flaws O
they O
have O
, O
are O
not O
to O
be O
thrown O
away O
. O

The O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
must O
impose O
a O
mission O
that O
induces O
the O
Russian O
government O
to O
open O
dialogue O
with O
the O
civilian O
authorities O
of O
Chechnya B-LOC
and O
not O
with O
the O
current O
puppet O
government O
son O
of O
ghost O
elections O
. O

Iraq B-LOC
? O

Unfortunately O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
does O
not O
want O
to O
let O
go O
, O
but O
the O
reasoning O
is O
the O
same O
. O

Preventing O
would O
be O
better O
than O
curing O
. O

We O
should O
not O
always O
respond O
to O
the O
various O
calls O
to O
arms O
but O
say O
enough O
to O
all O
forms O
of O
violence O
. O

The O
European B-LOC
Union I-LOC
has O
asked O
for O
explanations O
on O
the O
massacre O
of O
Beslan B-LOC
... O

The O
EU B-LOC
Foreign O
Ministry O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
did O
not O
speak O
in O
a O
personal O
capacity O
. O

But O
if O
Europe B-LOC
were O
to O
reverse O
on O
this O
front O
it O
would O
mean O
that O
it O
is O
too O
weak O
. O

Can O
peace O
win O
yes O
or O
no O
? O

It O
can O
win O
, O
otherwise O
the O
whole O
world O
would O
end O
Ossetia B-LOC
. O

He O
's O
optimistic O
, O
then O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
optimistic O
: O

It O
's O
a O
hope O
. O

Also O
because O
in O
recent O
years O
the O
interest O
in O
these O
issues O
has O
grown O
as O
we O
record O
also O
in O

And O
now O
also O
the O
bewilderment O
for O
a O
failure O
that O
has O
been O
repeated O
when O
no O
one O
could O
expect O
it O
anymore O
and O
when O
it O

According O
to O
items O

in O

unconfirmed O
, O
the O

occurred O
while O
a O
maintenance O

and O
it O
would O
also O
block O
many O
of O
the O

that O
are O
used O
for O

with O

in O

The O

guaranteed O
that O
there O
were O
no O

. O

No O

the O

the O

so O
much O
to O
rediscover O
a O

that O
over O

less O

The O
challenge O
is O
to O
grow O
even O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
a O
movement O
until O
a O
couple O
of O
years O

absolutely O

been O
back O

as O

How O
did O
this O
collaboration O
with O
the O
Team B-ORG
come O
about O
? O

Even O
after O
stopping O
pedalling O
seriously O
, O
passion O
has O
never O
been O
dissolved O
completely O
: O

After O
participating O
in O
the O
Italian O
Championships O
of O
the O
urban O

I O
decided O
to O
get O
back O
on O
the O
saddle O

and O
while O
I O
was O
in O
service O
at O
the O
Gigino O
Battisti O

the O
triptych O
of O
the O
Forti B-ORG

Veloci I-ORG

I O
was O
approached O
by O
Andrea B-PER
Martinelli I-PER
, O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Trentino B-ORG
Women I-ORG
's O
Team O
, O
who O
proposed O
to O
me O
to O
collaborate O
with O
them O
. O

From O
next O
season O
the O
commitment O
will O
be O
even O
greater O
. O

That O
's O
right O
. O

I O
started O
last O
June O
, O
and O
I O
went O
to O
side O
with O
Graziano B-PER
Calvi I-PER
and O
Manuela B-PER
Povolo I-PER
. O

But O
from O
next O
season O
Graziano B-PER
will O
take O
care O
of O
the O
promotion O
and O
public O
relations O
, O
so O
to O
speak O

Manuela B-PER
and O
I O
will O
take O

will O
be O

This O
year O
there O
were O
five O

and O
from O
next O
year O
they O
will O
become O
as O
many O
as O

will O
arrive O

, O
Val B-LOC

Cembra I-LOC
, O
Rotaliana B-LOC
, O
perhaps O
also O
from O
Bolzano B-LOC
. O

That O
's O
a O
good O
commitment O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
must O
be O
a O
satisfaction O
to O
be O
the O
reference O
company O
of O
the O
entire O
province B-LOC

But O
, O
provocatively O
, O
would O
n't O
you O
be O
more O
happy O
not O
to O
have O
the O
exclusive O
? O

In O
short O
, O
your O
unfortunately O
is O
a O
leadership O
daughter O
of O
the O
scarcity O
of O
female O
societies O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
we O
would O
be O
delighted O
to O
be O
able O
to O
deal O
with O
other O
realities O
like O
ours O
. O

The O
more O
, O
the O
better O
, O
for O
everyone O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
Trentino B-ORG
Women I-ORG

Team I-ORG
was O
born O
precisely O
because O
the O
square O
did O
n't O
propose O
anything O
to O
girls O
who O
after O
the O
Youth B-ORG
category O
would O
have O
wanted O
to O
continue O
. O

That O
was O
the O
main O
reason O
why O
I O
accepted O
this O
challenge O
: O

allow O
young O
athletes O
to O
continue O
to O
cultivate O
their O
passion O
. O

Accepting O
a O
challenge O
means O
, O
however O
, O
also O
facing O
unknowns O
. O

Fear O
? O

No O
, O
I O
had O
some O
about O
the O
numerical O
consistency O
of O
the O
group O
, O
fifteen O
athletes O
together O
are O
not O
easy O
to O
manage O
, O
there O
is O
always O
the O
risk O
that O
there O
are O
misunderstandings O
or O
misunderstandings O

But O
after O
the O

all O

the O

does O
not O

that O
sad O

such O
as O
the O

can O
happen O
every O
now O
and O
then O

In O
the O

they O
explain O
that O
up O
to O
three O
years O

, O
before O
the O
introduction O
of O
the O
single O
subscription O
to O
100 O

later O
52 O

, O
there O
were O
several O
reports O
of O

These O
were O
mostly O
boys O
who O

perhaps O
for O

Then O
, O
luckily O
, O
the O
problem O
seems O
to O
have O
dropped O
in O
intensity O
, O
although O
some O
reporting O
to O

occasionally O
comes O

In O
the O

they O
are O
aware O

this O

have O
therefore O
prepared O

missing O
at O
the O
ultra O
- O
fifty O
- O
year O
- O
old O
event O
in O
Trentina O
is O
a O
larger O
showcase O
, O
that O
makes O
him O

outside O

And O
above O
all O
a O
greater O
protagonism O
of O
the O
city O

Nichetti B-PER
, O
she O
is O
a O
very O
appreciated O
director O
who O
has O
been O
able O
to O
innovate O
Italian O
cinema O
. O

However O
, O
he O
does O
not O
have O
a O
specific O
competence O
for O
mountaineering O
. O

Why O
was O
he O
chosen O
as O
director O
of O
the O
Mountain O
Film O
Festival O
? O

It O
's O
true O
. O

I O
am O
not O
an O
expert O
mountaineer O
, O
I O
do O
not O
have O
a O
specific O
competence O
. O

I O
said O
that O
when O
they O
contacted O
me O
last O
June O
14th O
. O

In O
the O
past O
edition O
I O
presided O
over O
the O
jury O
of O
the O
Film O
Festival O
and O
for O
me O
it O
was O
an O
extraordinary O
experience O
. O

I O
was O
a O
jury O
member O
of O
other O
festivals O
, O
from O
Cannes B-LOC
to O
Montreal B-LOC
to O
Venice B-LOC
, O
but O
here O
in O
Trento B-LOC
it O
was O
something O
special O
. O

Among O
the O
jurors O
there O
was O
no O
political O
clash O
or O
film O
school O
, O
but O
everyone O
loved O
the O
mountain O
deeply O
. O

Let O
's O
see O
if O
I O
can O
give O
more O
visibility O
to O
Trento B-LOC
, O
the O
capital O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O

Although O
of O
quality O
, O
the O
Film O
Festival O
has O
never O
found O
large O
spaces O
on O
the O
national O
media O
. O

Why O
? O

The O
Trento B-LOC
Festival O
is O
incredibly O
underestimated O
by O
the O
national O
media O
, O
both O
by O
the O
press O
and O
by O
TV O
. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
in O
Italy B-LOC
to O
introduce O
him O
. O

It O
must O
definitely O
have O
a O
larger O
showcase O
, O
and O
for O
that O
I O
will O
work O
. O

But O
beyond O
a O
few O
passages O
on O
national O
TVs O
, O
we O
will O
bring O
the O
event O
on O
the O
net O
, O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
making O
it O
accessible O
to O
a O
vast O
audience O
, O
not O
only O
of O
traditional O
enthusiasts O
. O

The O
risk O
sometimes O
is O
that O
it O
will O
be O
reduced O
to O
an O
industry O
festival O
, O
for O
a O
few O
professionals O
. O

It O
is O
a O
risk O
that O
we O
must O
avoid O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
while O
safeguarding O
the O
style O
of O
the O
festival O
, O
we O
must O
reach O
a O
wider O
audience O
, O
and O
greater O
visibility O
outside O
on O
the O
city O
. O

Last O
year O
, O
circling O
around O
Trento B-LOC
, O
I O
had O
the O
perception O
that O
the O
festival O
was O
in O
a O
non O
- O
place O
, O
the O
city O
did O
n't O
feel O
it O
as O
its O
own O
. O

What O
plans O
do O
you O
have O
in O
mind O
? O

It O
is O
necessary O
that O
in O
the O
week O
of O
the O
festival O
the O
restaurants O
organize O
themed O
initiatives O
, O
the O
schools O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
participate O
in O
the O
screenings O
, O
the O
squares O
of O
Trento B-LOC
involve O
the O
people O
on O
the O
Filmfestival O
. O

I O
think O
of O
a O
projection O
in O
Piazza B-LOC
Dante I-LOC
or O
in O
Piazza B-LOC
Battisti I-LOC
. O

Then O
to O
projections O
in O
the O
halls O
, O
to O
subject O
. O

In O
a O
hall O
the O
retrospectives O
. O

In O
the O
other O
the O

for O

. O

In O
the O
other O
film O
of O
the O
historical O
archive O
of O
50 O
' O
years O
of O

. O

Not O
everyone O
liked O
the O
screenings O
in O
the O
halls O
. O

There O
are O
those O
who O
regretted O
the O
auditorium O
. O

Will O
you O
go O
back O
to O
the O
S.Chiara O
? O

It O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
for O
me O
to O
bring O
the O
projections O
into O
the O
city O
. O

You O
can O
also O
bring O
them O
back O
to O
the O
auditorium O
, O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
return O
something O
self O

referential O
for O

the O

considers O

all O

This O
was O
said O
last O

Bressanini I-PER
, O
author O
of O
the O

. O

Bressanini B-PER
, O
in O
essence O
, O
explained O
that O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
of I-LOC
Lavis I-LOC
does O
not O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
being O
aggregated O
to O
Trento B-LOC
, O
but O
could O
constitute O
a O
reality O
to O
itself O
with O
Zambana B-LOC
and O
Nave B-LOC
S. I-LOC
Rocco I-LOC
. O

Among O
other O
things O
, O
the O
three O

are O
among O
the O
few O
that O
have O
not O
yet O
moved O

has O
already O
happened O
for O

Father O
Giulio B-PER
Albanese I-PER
( O
in O
the O

) O
has O
left O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
agency O
Misna B-ORG
, O
news O
agency O
close O
to O
the O
Italian O
missionary O
world O
, O
much O
appreciated O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
information O
, O
in O
particular O
for O
that O
coming O
from O
the O
most O
difficult O
areas O
of O
the O
world O
. O

It O
was O
Father O
Albanese B-PER
himself O
who O
explained O
with O
an O
editorial O
published O
by O
the O
agency O
the O
reasons O
for O
his O
resignation O
: O

For O
a O
complex O
set O
of O
reasons O
, O
including O
the O
awareness O
of O
no O
longer O
getting O
full O
support O
from O
the O
competent O
offices O
that O
seemed O
indispensable O
to O
me O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
leave O
my O
position O
as O
director O
responsible O
for O
Misna B-ORG
. O

I O
do O
not O
do O
so O
at O
any O
time O
and O
, O
put O
aside O
by O
any O
legitimate O
bitterness O
, O
I O
leave O
the O
signature O
of O
agreement O
with O
the O
publisher O
, O
in O
compliance O
with O
the O
current O
regulations O
. O

Father O
Albanese B-PER
recalled O
that O
almost O
seven O
years O
have O
passed O
since O
the O
Misna B-ORG
made O
its O
first O
experimental O
launch O
on O
December O
2 O
, O
1997 O
. O

Then O
our O
aim O
was O
to O
give O
voice O
to O
that O
part O
of O
the O
world O
that O
, O
although O
it O
is O
the O
largest O
, O
rarely O
finds O
the O
appropriate O
spaces O
to O
talk O
about O
itself O
, O
to O
tell O
its O
dramas O
, O
to O
make O
known O
stories O
unpublished O
and O
compelling O
. O

The O
editor O
and O
editor O
expressed O
their O
regret O
for O
this O
decision O
. O

In O
the O
round O
success O
against O
Castelfranco B-ORG
there O
is O
the O
magic O
touch O
of O
the O
quality O

33 O

old O
man O
with O
his O

well O

- O
because O
when O
you O
have O
two O

and O
a O

you O
have O
to O
make O
meditated O

. O

At O
times O
of O
uncertainty O
such O
as O
these O
does O
not O
count O
the O
category O
but O
projects O
; O

and O
the O
company O
in O
Trento B-LOC
has O
one O
that O
is O
worth O
" O
. O

And O
then O
, O
the O
team O
is O
strong O
; O

can O
aim O
at O
the O
top O
. O

We O
are O
well O
equipped O
: O

Maraner B-PER
has O
practically O
two O
men O
available O
for O
each O
role O
. O

So O
there O
is O
the O
possibility O
to O
choose O
using O
the O
form O
and O
situations O
of O
the O
moment O
. O

Return O
in O
gialloblu O
after O
12 O
years O
; O

then O
his O
name O
was O
Trento O
. O

I O
came O
from O
the O
Spring B-ORG
of O
Verona B-ORG
and O
for O
me O
it O
was O
a O
bet O
: O

I O
had O
to O
figure O
out O
if O
I O
was O
gon O
na O
be O
a O
football O
player O
or O
not O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
enough O
to O
meet O
a O
coach O
like O
Cavasin B-PER
who O
gave O
me O
confidence O
by O
making O
me O
play O
as O
a O
holder O
and O
taught O
me O
a O
lot O
. O

And O
now O
again O
in O
Trento B-LOC
, O
because O
from O
Pescantina B-LOC

where O
Migliorini B-PER
lives O

the O
little O
Christians O
( O
almost O
two O
years O

and O
Andrea B-PER
( O
two O

- O
in O
a O
moment O
you O
are O
at O

and O
then O
there O
's O
Christian B-PER
Soave I-PER

in O

Yesterday O
the O
most O
sorry O
about O
what O
happened O
at O
the O
end O
was O
just O
him O
. O

But O
he O
had O
made O
a O
deal O
with O
his O
son O
and O
that O
" O
Z O
" O
on O
the O
shirt O
had O
to O
show O
it O
. O

It O
was O
a O
lightness O
, O
agreed O
; O

Perhaps O
he O
no O
longer O
remembered O
that O
he O
had O
been O
warned O
before O
. O

As O
I O
said O
, O
however O
, O
our O
team O
is O
a O
team O
in O
which O
we O
are O
all O
owners O
: O

One O
comes O
out O

the O
one O
who O
enters O

that O
will O
have O
to O
give O
Via B-ORG
Segantini I-ORG
a O
role O
different O
from O
the O
current O
one O
. O

A O
need O
that O
arises O
from O
the O
desire O
to O
renew O
the O
organisation O
and O
to O
provide O
services O
to O
its O
members O
with O
greater O
efficiency O
, O
especially O
on O
the O

of O
the O

" O
It O
will O
not O
be O
a O

" O
explained O

But O
important O

the O

Carlo B-PER
Dellasega I-PER

A O

This O
is O
a O
cooperative O
culture O
operation O
, O
says O
Dellasega B-PER
, O
because O
it O
intends O
to O
give O
priority O
to O
the O
method O
of O
sharing O
and O
participation O
, O
dialogue O
and O
confrontation O
. O

A O
method O
that O
is O
defined O
as O
new O
compared O
to O
the O
past O
and O
that O
will O
lead O
the O
project O
managers O
to O
listen O

and O
- O
it O
has O
emphasized O
Agricola B-PER
- O
anti O
- O
inflammatory O
cures O
. O

In O
just O
a O
few O
days O
, O
then O
, O
it O
will O
be O
known O
whether O
Juventus B-ORG
will O
have O
to O
do O
without O
the O
French O
champion O
for O
a O
long O
period O
of O
the O
season O
. O

An O
uncertainty O
that O
is O
also O
reflected O
on O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
other O
injured O
of O
Bianconero O
luxury O
, O
Alessandro B-PER
Del I-PER
Piero I-PER
. O

With O
the O
market O
closed O
until O
January O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
prolonged O
stop O
of O
Trezeguet B-PER
would O
require O
an O
accelerated O
recovery O
of O
the O
number O
ten O
Juventus O
. O

The O
only O
Ibrahimovic B-PER
, O
as O
far O
as O
it O
is O
proving O
to O
be O
a O
good O
purchase O
, O
can O
not O
be O
enough O
to O
a O
team O
engaged O
on O
multiple O
fronts O
like O
the O
Juventus B-ORG
. O

And O
Zalayeta B-PER
, O
despite O
having O
already O
scored O
decisive O
goals O
, O
remains O
an O
unknown O
on O
the O
level O
of O
continuity O
. O

Fortunately O
for O
Juve B-ORG
, O
however O
, O
the O
uncertainties O
of O
the O
attack O
are O
compensated O
by O
the O
rediscovered O
security O
of O
the O
defense O
. O

A O
department O
regenerated O
by O
the O
care O
of O
Capello B-PER
with O
the O
grafting O
of O
Cannavaro B-PER
and O
the O
recovery O
of O
Hajim B-PER
. O

Last O
year O
I O
did O
not O
have O
an O
easy O
season O
because O
I O
was O
not O
well O
- O
said O
the O
French O
defender O
- O
I O
injured O
myself O
at O
the O
ankle O
in O
the O
first O
game O
with O
the'Empoli B-ORG
and O
I O
recovered O
only O
for O
the O
Europeans O
" O
. O

You O
have O
a O
clear O
idea O
about O
Juventus B-ORG
' O
defense O
bunker O
: O

When O
you O
take O
a O
few O
goals O
- O
it O
has O
emphasized O
- O
you O
owe O
it O
to O
the O
whole O
team O
that O
is O
working O
well O
. O

Cannavaro B-PER
, O
Buffon B-PER
and O
I O
are O
close O
, O
and O
playing O
alongside O
Fabio B-PER
facilitates O
things O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
serious O
to O
give O
us O
all O
the O
credit O
. O

In O
any O
case O
- O
he O
added O
): O
before O
giving O
a O
final O
judgment O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
whole O
championship O
. O

We O
're O
going O
well O
, O
but O
you O
can O
start O
well O
and O
end O
badly O
, O
or O
vice O
versa O
. O

And O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
big O
ones O
in O
trouble O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
they O
'll O
be O
ahead O
, O
close O
to O
us O
. O

He B-PER
tries O
to O
mask O
his O
concern O
about O
the O
injuries O
of O
Del B-PER

and O
Trezeguet B-PER
: O

" O

By O
LUISA B-PER
PATRUNO I-PER

For O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
is O
a O
delicate O
passage O
: O

It O
has O
to O
cut O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
budget O
by O
3 O
% O
, O
which O
means O
, O
compared O
to O
the O
EUR O
3,943 O
million O
of O
the O
2004 O
settlement O
, O
giving O
up O
about O
EUR O
120 O
million O
. O

And O
he O
has O
to O
decide O
what O
to O
aim O
for O
and O
what O
to O
sacrifice O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
he O
announced O
to O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
leaders O
that O
he O
would O
not O
present O
the O
2005 O
budget O
in O
time O
to O
avoid O
the O
provisional O
year O
. O

We O
will O
approve O
it O
to O
the O
end O
of O
November O
instead O
that O
within O
October O
- O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
has O
explained O
- O
so O
that O
the O
examination O
in O
commission O
will O
be O
able O
to O
begin O
to O
half O
January O
and O
to O
land O
in O
classroom O
to O
February O
. O

We O
are O
waiting O
for O
the O
tax O
maneuver O
of O
the O
Government O
that O
will O
present O
with O
the O
financial O
, O
without O
which O
we O
are O
not O
able O
to O
know O
exactly O
what O
and O
how O
much O
resources O
we O
can O
count O
on O
. O

Officially O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
Province B-LOC
is O
forced O
to O
slip O
into O
operation O
provided O
for O
external O
reasons O
and O
not O
to O
risk O
drawing O
up O
an O
accounting O
document O
intended O
then O
to O
be O
remodelled O
. O

But O
the O
postponement O
remains O
a O
sign O
of O
difficulty O
, O
which O
rating O
agencies O
, O
which O
until O
now O
have O
rewarded O
our O
Province B-LOC
, O
may O
not O
ignore O
in O
next O
year O
's O
judgment O
. O

Provisional O
financial O
year O
means O
that O
the O
first O
months O
of O
the O
year O
should O
be O
limited O
to O
ordinary O
administration O
. O

And O
more O
than O
one O
councilman O
had O
advised O
against O
this O
choice O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
it O
is O
not O
only O
the O
time O
of O
Minister O
Siniscalco B-PER
and O
Mr O
Berlusconi B-PER
to O
postpone O
Dellai B-PER
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
recent O
weeks O
, O
the O
President O
compared O
himself O
with O
his O
junta B-ORG
, O
showed O
the O
accounts O
and O
forecasts O
and O
called O
for O
a O
responsible O
attitude O
. O

Then O
he O
sent O
a O
letter O
- O
it O
is O
these O
days O
- O
to O
every O
city O
council O
member O
in O
which O
he O
basically O
asks O
everyone O
to O
indicate O
the O
priorities O
and O
above O
all O
what O
and O
how O
much O
- O
in O
percentage O
- O
he O
is O
willing O
to O
cut O
compared O
to O
his O
budget O
2004 O
, O
manifesting O
the O
need O
to O
achieve O
a O
total O
reduction O
- O
leak O
- O
even O
3 O
% O
. O

The O
President O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
for O
the O
policy O
that O
this O
central O
- O
left O
government O
has O
given O
itself O
, O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
cut O
on O
the O
social O
state O
, O
in O
particular O
on O
health O
, O
nor O
on O
the O
social O
and O
welfare O
sector O
, O
although O
many O
of O
the O
announced O
intentions O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
be O
reduced O
, O
and O
on O
research O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
Dellai B-PER
wants O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
Stability O
Pact O
with O
the O
State O
and O
not O
be O
downgraded O
by O
rating O
agencies O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
orientation O
that O
is O
emerging O
is O
that O
the O
sectors O
that O
will O
have O
to O
sacrifice O
themselves O
the O
most O
will O
be O
: O

culture O
, O
public O
works O
and O
economic O
sectors O
. O

In O
short O
, O
there O
will O
be O
fewer O
resources O
for O
museums O
, O
bands O
and O
associations O
, O
to O
realize O
roads O
, O
sports O
halls O
and O
firehouses O
in O
every O
corner O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
but O
also O
less O
contributions O
and O
initiatives O
in O
support O
of O
economic O
activities O
. O

The O
efforts O
of O
the O
territorial O
pacts O
, O
which O
are O
sucking O
many O
resources O
, O
will O
be O
readjusted O
. O

This O
is O
just O
to O
name O
a O
few O
of O
the O
most O
risky O
items O
. O

For O
Dellai B-PER
, O
this O
is O
not O
only O
the O
forecast O
budget O
for O
2005 O
, O
but O
it O
will O
have O
to O
represent O
, O
as O
he O
calls O
it O
, O
a O
legislative O
budget O
, O
which O
means O
the O
design O
of O
what O
his O
government O
can O
afford O
to O
do O
or O
not O
to O
do O
in O
the O
four O
years O
that O
remain O
, O
well O
knowing O
, O
that O
the O
financial O
trend O
of O
the O
legislature O
, O
according O
to O
forecasts O
, O
in O
the O
worst O
case O
scenario O
can O
reach O
up O
to O
8 O
% O
less O
than O
the O
2004 O
budget O
. O

In O
view O
of O
the O
outlook O
, O
Dellai B-PER
is O
trying O
to O
find O
the O
widest O
sharing O
- O
even O
of O
the O
economic O
and O
social O
categories O
- O
on O
the O
priorities O
that O
his O
government O
will O
decide O
to O
give O
itself O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
he O
expects O
much O
from O
the O
Trentino O
, O
Trentino O
, O
consultation O
tables O
, O
to O
work O
since O
September O
, O
but O
from O
which O
so O
far O
he O
has O
come O
out O
very O
little O
concrete O
. O

Word O

, O
number O
one O
of O
the O
Cgil B-ORG
: O

The O
budget O
cuts O
had O
been O
partly O
anticipated O
, O
but O
the O
3 O
% O
reduction O
is O
worrying O
. O

So O
far O
there O
have O
been O
no O
meetings O
between O
the O
parties O
, O
but O
Purin B-PER
immediately O
wants O
to O
clarify O
some O
points O
: O

" O
We O
are O
going O
through O
a O
delicate O
phase O
, O
which O
involves O
a O
series O
of O
investments O
on O
the O
development O
of O
the O
economy O
, O
at O
work O
, O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
weakest O
groups O
. O

We O
will O
see O
the O
official O

continues O
Purin B-PER

but O
these O
are O
our O
conditions O

Polemica O
shared O
in O
full O
by O
Ermanno B-PER
Monari I-PER
, O
Secretary O
General O
of O
the O
Uil B-ORG
: O

We O
have O
long O
sent O
a O
letter O
to O
President O
Dellai B-PER
asking O
for O
additional O
resources O
on O
public O
employment O
contracts O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
response O
. O

First O
reason O
for O
controversy O
. O

But O
that O
's O
not O
all O
: O

" O
Many O
other O

have O
long O
adopted O
the O

Document O
, O
ed O
. O
) O
while O
the O
Province B-LOC
merely O
presents O
the O
budget O
. O

And O
to O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
important O
to O
know O
what O
the O
junta B-ORG
's O
income O
and O
investment O
policy O
is O
. O

According O
to O
Monari B-PER
, O
the O
historical O
moment O
is O
so O
worrying O
that O
it O
motivates O
the O
involvement O
not O
only O
of O
the O
unions O
, O
but O
of O
the O
entire O
civil O
society O
in O
the O
policies O
of O
relaunching O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

Even O
according O
to O
the O
Uil B-ORG
Secretary O
, O
a O
declining O
budget O
must O
study O
what O
are O
the O
most O
effective O
weapons O
to O
counter O
the O
unhappiness O
of O

Not O

and O
to O
all O
the O
fabric O
of O

that O
accompanies O
the O
event O
of O
birth O
. O

Because O
breast O
- O
feeding O
is O
a O
desire O
of O
almost O
all O
Trentino O
mothers O
. O

It O
is O
very O
rare O
- O
it O
has O
emphasized O
the O
newbornlogist O
Dino B-PER
Pedrotti I-PER
- O
that O
a O
mother O
asks O
not O
to O
breastfeed O
. O

Cultural O
work O
and O
raising O
awareness O
of O
mothers O
has O
borne O
fruit O
. O

It O
is O
now O
up O
to O
all O
operators O
to O
ensure O
that O
this O
desire O
can O
be O
fulfilled O
. O

And O
it O
is O
precisely O
on O
the O
data O

concrete O

that O
the O

has O
focused O
on O

The O
data O
of O
our O

encouraging O
because O
they O
have O
seen O
a O

the O

Promotion O

TRENTO B-LOC

of O
the O
assumption O
of O
capital O
increase O
, O
shift O
to O
the O
next O
Board O

Directors O
, O
due O
to O
the O
uncertainty O
about O

, O
of O
the O
operational O
programme O
for O
2005 O
, O
updating O
the O
one O
carried O
out O
for O
the O
current O
year O
. O

It O
will O
be O
a O
board O
of O

full O
of O
arguments O
but O
with O
few O
final O
decisions O
that O
the O
Trentino B-ORG
Spa I-ORG
will O
announce O
this O
afternoon O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
at O
an O
informal O
meeting O
of O
the O
Management B-ORG
Board I-ORG
, O
it O
was O
made O
clear O
that O
the O
increase O
in O
capital O
is O
better O
not O
to O
do O
anything O
about O
it O
. O

For O
President O
Claudio B-PER
Miorelli I-PER
, O
the O
item O
on O
the O
agenda O
will O
be O
discussed O
, O
as O
I O
said O
it O
was O
an O
option O
that O
could O
be O
included O
in O
the O
next O
extraordinary O
assembly O
. O

There O
is O
no O
urgency O
, O
so O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
nothing O
will O
be O
done O
about O
it O
. O

As O
the O
question O
of O
resources O
for O
2005 O
comes O
to O
the O
fore O
, O
and O
the O
tourism O
fund O
, O
whose O
proposal O
now O
awaits O
only O
the O
visa O
of O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
, O
remains O
a O
pure O
hypothesis O
, O
today O
the O
cda B-ORG
will O
discuss O
the O
promotion O
for O
next O
year O
. O

But O
probably O
- O
says O
Miorelli B-PER
- O
his O
approval O
will O
slip O
to O
the O
next O
cda O
. O

The O
amount O
of O
resources O
available O
should O
first O
be O
clarified O
. O

Meanwhile O

say O
that O
the O

becomes O
dangerous O
if O

Surely O
he O
was O
a O
man O
of O
rank O
: O

it O
carried O
an O
object O
reserved O
for O
the O
highest O
class O
, O
a O
copper O
axe O
. O

In O
his O
hands O
he O
held O
a O
dagger O
, O
and O
his O
body O
showed O
obvious O
signs O
of O
struggle O
. O

The O
most O
recent O
hypotheses O
speak O
of O
a O
shepherd O
, O
murdered O
for O
his O
flocks O
. O

But O
if O
it O
were O
so O
- O
he O
explained O
Tecchiati B-PER
- O
why O
did O
n't O
they O
steal O
the O
axe O

an O
object O
from O
the O
enormous O
value O
at O
the O
time O
? O

@elder_man O

Another O
hypothesis O
speaks O
of O
a O
shaman O
, O
a O
man O
of O
religion O
who O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
himself O
for O
his O
people O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
explained O
, O
even O
in O
this O
case O
, O
the O
armament O
he O
was O
endowed O
with O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
and O
the O
blow O
behind O
him O
. O

In O
cases O
documented O
archaeologically O
of O
human O
sacrifices O
, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
ritual O
killing O
, O
with O
an O
arrow O
stuck O
behind O
the O
back O
from O
a O
remarkable O
distance O
at O
a O
speed O
of O
about O
140 O
km O
. O

According O
to O
Tecchiati B-PER
, O
he O
was O
definitely O
a O
high O
- O
ranking O
man O
, O
a O
survivor O
, O
since O
at O
a O
time O
when O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
reach O
the O
age O
of O
thirty O
, O
Oetzi B-PER
died O
murdered O
at O
an O
age O
of O
over O
40 O
. O

The O
poor O
weariness O
of O
the O
bones O
of O
the O
joints O
denotes O
a O
life O
without O
physical O
stress O
, O
therefore O
excludes O
the O
pastor O
's O
hypothesis O
. O

Tattoos O
on O
the O
body O
are O
not O
evidence O
of O
belonging O
to O
a O
specific O
caste O
like O
that O
of O
shamans O
, O
because O
the O
most O
plausible O
explanation O
would O
seem O
that O
magical O
thaumaturgic O
, O
reserved O
for O
a O
particular O
man O
, O
but O
not O
necessarily O
to O
a O
man O
of O
religion O
. O

The O
mystery O
of O
Ötzi B-PER
continues O
to O
fascinate O
the O
researchers O

and O
is O
destined O
to O
keep O

as O
an O
intolerable O
affront O
and O
a O
deadly O
danger O
, O
has O
forgotten O
a O
few O
things O
. O

The O
first O
is O
that O
, O
among O
the O
many O
powers O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC

its O
councillors O
, O
there O
is O
not O
to O
prevent O
an O
enterprise O
from O
doing O
its O
job O
, O
and O
to O
do O
it O
in O

, O
if O
it O
believes O
it O
can O
do O
it O
with O

. O

Whether O
it O
is O
based O
in O
Bolzano B-LOC

Shanghai B-LOC
, O
it O
makes O
no O
difference O
. O

The O
interference O
of O
a O
politician O
and O
an O
administrator O
in O
market O
matters O
is O
, O
yes O
, O
intolerable O
. O

Unless O
the O
condemnation O
of O
the O
conflict O
of O
interest O
applies O
only O
to O
some O
and O
not O
to O
others O
. O

The O
second O
thing O
that O
Grisenti B-PER
forgot O
is O
that O
today O
is O
still O
a O
little O
late O
to O
get O
on O
the O
field O
. O

" O
We O

not O

" O
he O

no O
one O

it O

one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
the O
largest O
banks O
in O
Trentino O
have O
fallen O
under O
the O
control O
of O
large O
national O
groups O
. O

The O
war O
against O
conquest O
was O
to O
be O
waged O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
when O

however O
, O
the O
rich O
gains O
received O
by O
those O
who O
sold O
the O

the O

less O

, O
now O
, O
to O

those O
temptations O
he O
could O

. O

you O

when O

The O
third O
thing O
that O
the O
council O
member O
has O
forgotten O
is O
that O
the O
final O
judges O
of O

I O
myself O

Amistadi B-PER
reveals O
- O
do O
not O
find O
it O
correct O
because O
it O
guarantees O
those O
who O
have O
already O
had O
, O
while O
it O
penalizes O
us O
new O

. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
only O
going O

The O
city O

believes O
that O
there O
is O
a O
real O
risk O
that O
the O
municipal O

will O
not O
be O
passed O
in O
good O
time O

concerned O
that O
its O

be O
useless O

" O
I O
have O
applied O

I O
am O
here O

" O
Amistadi B-PER
says O
, O
" O
only O
to O
obtain O
the O
approval O
of O
this O
law O

" O

Amistadi B-PER
has O
given O
himself O
this O
mission O
and O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
objective O
is O
to O
arrive O
in O
time O
for O
these O
municipal O
elections O
, O
since O
the O
law O
provides O
for O
some O
important O
changes O
, O
it O
must O
be O
said O
that O
his O
mandate O
as O
city O
council O
member O
lasts O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O

will O
have O
to O
give O
way O
to O

then O

Maria B-PER
, O
true O
teacher O
and O
friend O

Lia B-PER
Guardini I-PER
remembers O
Professor O
Marchetti B-PER

It O
will O
be O
held O
this O
morning O
at O
11 O
a.m. O
, O
in O

church O
of O
the O

of O

, O
esteemed O
professor O
of O
Italian O
first O
at O

and O
then O
at O
the O

. O

This O
is O
what O
Professor O
Lia B-PER
Guardini I-PER
remembers O
. O

I O
met O
Maria B-PER
Matteucci I-PER
Marchetti I-PER
at O
the O
" O
Prati B-ORG
" O
, O
where O
it O
is O
like O
a O
meteor O
, O
for O
the O
space O
of O
a O
few O
years O
. O

High O
and O
serious O
serious O
, O
with O
that O
air O
at O
first O
sight O
very O
severe O
. O

It O
's O
also O
hard O
to O
talk O
first O
. O

Then O
there O
is O
something O
that O
becomes O
a O
true O
and O
sincere O
friendship O
, O
with O
ups O
and O
downs O
like O
all O
long O
friendships O
a O
nice O
piece O
of O
life O
. O

Friendship O
means O
spending O
afternoons O
and O
evenings O
and O
nights O
together O
to O
read O
and O
study O
and O
discuss O
, O
but O
she O
talks O
more O
and O
more O
because O
she O
knows O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
and O
is O
really O
able O
to O
fascinate O
and O
involve O
. O

Friendship O
means O
studying O
, O
but O
also O
having O
some O
laughs O
and O
a O
few O
laps O
on O
Lake B-LOC
Garda I-LOC
, O
or O
go O
to O
mushrooms O
up O
there O
, O
in O
Val B-LOC
di I-LOC
Sole I-LOC
, O
in O
Cusiano B-LOC
. O

Yeah O
, O
she O
laughs O
, O
" O
I O
'm O
thirty O
" O
with O
her O
unmistakable O
Tuscan O
accent O
. O

The O
dominant O
remains O
the O
study O
. O

It O
was O
a O
nice O
school O
. O

because O
she O
, O
Mary B-PER
, O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
speak O
of O
difficult O
and O
serious O
and O
challenging O
things O
with O
the O
lightness O
of O
curiosity O
, O
the O
accuracy O
of O
analysis O
and O
criticism O
, O
the O
precision O
of O
judgment O
. O

But O
talking O
about O
it O
now O
costs O
pain O
and O
fatigue O
. O

Thus O
, O
although O
in O
the O
background O
there O
is O
the O
gallery O
of O
the O
authors O
of O
the O
literature O
and O
there O
is O
a O
long O
theory O
of O
critics O
and O
there O
are O
the O
passion O
and O
enthusiasm O
of O
her O
, O
of O
Mary B-PER
today O
dominates O
the O
ultimate O
image O
, O
that O
of O
long O
suffering O
, O
of O
the O
ever O
greater O
and O
harder O
effort O
to O
live O
. O

Mary B-PER
always O
continues O
to O
fight O
and O
devour O
books O
, O
obsessively O
, O
almost O
to O
exorcise O
the O
problem O
of O
life O
that O
goes O
away O
, O
and O
the O
problem O
of O
death O
that O
this O
time O
is O
not O
written O
on O
a O
text O
of O
literature O
but O
that O
you O
plant O
inside O
the O
body O
and O
devours O
you O
. O

And O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
be O
as O
holy O
as O
Francis B-PER
to O
say O
" O
Laudato O
si O
' O
, O
my O
Lord B-PER
, O
for O
our O
sora O
death O
" O
. O

Normal O
people O
try O
, O
it O
is O
inevitable O
, O
bewilderment O
when O
you O
touch O
" O
the O
last O
line O
of O
things O
, O
" O
beyond O
which O
" O
we O
are O
dust O
and O
shadow O
. O
" O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
understand O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
, O
alongside O
the O
loss O
of O
those O
who O
have O
remained O
, O
there O
are O
also O
reasons O
for O
consolation O
. O

They O
will O
also O
be O
little O
thing O
in O
the O
face O
of O
loss O
, O
but O
at O
least O
there O
are O
. O

In O
the O
hardness O
of O
the O
detachment O
you O
can O
finally O
see O
it O
serene O
and O
large O
and O
no O
longer O
corraced O
: O

is O
no O
longer O
bent O
by O
suffering O
and O
illness O
. O

And O
then O
she O
stayed O
at O
her O
house O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
her O
things O
and O
her O
books O
and O
the O
environment O
of O
her O
life O
. O

With O
the O
Duomo O
outside O
the O
window O
and O
the O
hours O
that O
beat O
, O
difficult O
especially O
in O
the O
endless O
and O
exhausting O
length O
of O
the O
night O
. O

It O
may O
have O
been O
difficult O
and O
it O
will O
be O
little O
, O
but O
you O
can O
think O
and O
hope O
that O
Mary B-PER
is O
happy O
to O
have O
been O
accompanied O
so O
far O
beyond O
the O
last O
line O
of O
things O
. O

And O
you O
can O
only O
add O
, O
paraphrasing O
an O
ancient O
poet O
, O
that O
" O
if O
some O
sweetness O
can O
reach O
the O
silent O
tombs O
from O
our O
pain O
, O
from O
that O
sense O
of O
loss O
in O
which O
we O
keep O
alive O
the O
affections O
that O
have O
dissolved O
in O
fear O
, O
surely O
death O
will O
not O
give O
you O
a O
greater O
and O
stronger O
pain O
than O
the O
joy O
that O
will O
come O
to O
you O
from O
our O
love O
. O

the O
meeting O
, O
always O
in O
the O
Province O
, O
with O
the O

of O
Michelin B-ORG

, O
to O
take O
stock O
of O
the O

that O

followed O
for O
the O

Tomorrow O

, O
there O

: O

the O

lets O

will O
follow O

attention O
also O
the O
trade O
union O
manifestation O
next O
Friday O
( O
tomorrow O
, O
ed O
. O
) O
, O
hoping O
that O
the O
although O
understandable O
union O
protest O
still O
allows O
to O
give O
rise O
to O
a O
constructive O
dialogue O
between O
the O
social O
partners O
and O
the O
institutions O
: O

The O
meeting O
of O
13 O
is O
, O
in O
this O
sense O
, O
a O
first O
important O
positive O
signal O
that O
the O
provincial B-ORG
junta I-ORG
intends O
to O
enhance O
. O

To O
give O
a O
concrete O
signal O
of O
availability O
, O
Dellai B-PER
has O
already O
announced O
that O
he O
will O
meet O
, O
together O
with O
the O
competent O
councilors O
, O
a O
union O
delegation O
. O

The O
ball O
will O
then O
pass O
, O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
to O
the O
technicians O
, O
for O
a O
more O
operational O
comparison O
and O
focused O
on O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
approximately O
90 O
employees O
of O
the O
French O
multinational O
tires O
, O
which O
turned O
to O
an O
international O
agency O
, O
the O
Dml B-ORG
Conseil I-ORG
, O
to O
identify O
an O
industrial O
subject O
interested O
in O
the O
sub O
- O
entry O
, O
also O
assuming O
the O
financial O
charges O
of O
the O
operation O
and O
promoting O
a O
so O
- O
called O
social O
plan O
to O
mitigate O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
closure O
. O

But O
beyond O
the O
specific O
case O
, O
the O
risk O
of O
relocation O
continues O
to O
keep O
workers O
' O
organizations O
on O
the O
line O
. O

Although O
with O
different O
positions O
. O

The O
tendency O
to O
relocate O
, O
especially O
for O
textile O
companies O
- O
says O
the O
provincial O
secretary O
of O
Uil B-ORG
, O
Ermanno B-PER
Monari I-PER
- O
is O
a O
more O
than O
understandable O
need O
, O
and O
often O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
remain O
competitive O
. O

The O
relocation O
, O
therefore O
, O
should O
not O
be O
demonized O
but O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
governed O
. O

In O
order O
to O
succeed O
, O
Monari B-PER
explains O
, O
but O
it O
is O
necessary O
a O
great O
effort O
from O
all O
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
entrepreneur O
is O
placed O
in O
the O
condition O
of O
being O
able O
to O
move O
machinery O
and O
production O
, O
without O
this O
leading O
to O
a O
flight O
abroad O
of O
the O
company O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

" O
Head O
and O
business O
strategy O
, O
therefore O
, O
must O
remain O
, O
according O
to O
Monari B-PER
, O
on O
the O
territory O
, O
as O
well O
as O
wealth O
, O
which O
must O
be O
distributed O
and O
not O
dispersed O
abroad O

The O
naked O

news O
is O
this O
: O

Euro O

diesel O
vehicles O
, O
which O
last O
winter O
, O
when O
the O
fine O
dust O
values O
were O
exceeded O
for O
5 O
days O
, O
were O
stopped O
this O
year O
, O

be O
able O
to O
circulate O
. O

This O
is O
the O
clarification O
of O
the O
Appa B-ORG
after O
the O
different O
communication O
made O
yesterday O
by O
voice O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meeting O
between O
Province B-LOC
, O
technicians O
and O
municipalities O
. O

Therefore O
, O
only O
the O
Euro O
0 O
will O
be O
forced O
to O
stand O
still O
. O

And O
maybe O
not O
even O
those O
. O

Or O
at O
least O
, O
not O
all O
of O
them O
. O

In O
the O
programme O
agreement O
that O
the O
Province B-LOC
presented O
yesterday O
, O
as O
a O
basis O
for O
discussion O
waiting O
to O
put O
together O
the O
comments O
that O
will O
come O
next O
week O
from O
the O
municipalities O
, O
it O
is O
in O
fact O
hypothesized O
the O
possibility O
to O
grant O
a O
derogation O
to O
the O
circulation O
( O
from O
1 O
November O
2005 O
) O
to O
the O
owners O
of O
vehicles O
that O
would O
commit O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
to O
replace O
their O
old O
carts O
by O
means O
less O
polluting O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
if O
the O
owner O
of O
a O
non O
- O
catalysed O
petrol O
car O
or O
Euro O
0 O
diesel O
signed O
a O
kind O
of O
contract O
with O
the O
Province B-LOC
in O
which O
they O
formalized O
their O
intention O
to O
replace O
their O
pollutant O
by O
the O
expiry O
of O
the O
three O
- O
year O
plan O
, O
they O
would O
receive O
a O
kind O
of O
safe O
conduct O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
travel O
at O
any O
time O
of O
the O
year O
( O
and O
especially O
with O
any O
weather O
condition O
) O
on O
roads O
that O
would O
otherwise O
be O
off O
limits O
. O

The O
proposal O
, O
which O
is O
certainly O
already O
quite O
tempting O
for O
many O
, O
could O
even O
be O
unmissable O
if O
it O
passed O
the O
line O
of O
some O
municipalities O
that O
- O
according O
to O
indiscretions O
- O
would O
have O
already O
formulated O
to O
the O
city O
council O
member O
the O
intention O
to O
request O
that O
the O
derogation O
be O
activated O
already O
from O
this O
winter O
. O

For O
his O
part O
, O
Councillor O
Gilmozzi B-PER
must O
be O
cautious O
. O

The O
delicate O
matter O
and O
you O
risk O
a O
lot O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
should O
be O
pointed O
out O
that O
this O
is O
a O
proposal O
; O

It O
will O
have O
to O
be O
discussed O
with O
all O
municipalities O
. O

On O
the O
issue O
of O
derogations O
it O
will O
then O
be O
the O
individual O
administrations O
that O
decide O
to O
whom O
to O
issue O
the O
permit O
of O
circulation O
despite O
the O
blocks O
, O
certainly O
not O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

The O
risk O
, O
easily O
intuitable O
, O
is O
that O
if O
the O
municipalities O
were O
to O
be O
quite O
indulgent O
in O
granting O
derogations O
, O
very O
few O
polluting O
vehicles O
would O
remain O
stationary O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Councillor O
Gilmozzi B-PER
announces O
that O
the O
start O
to O
old O
- O
generation O
diesel O
and O
gasoline O
blocks O
( O
two O
days O
a O
week O
) O
should O
start O
on O
November O
15th O
. O

Before O
that O
date O
, O
although O
yesterday O
( O
and O
on O
the O
seventh O
consecutive O
day O
) O
the O
limits O
have O
been O
exceeded O
, O
no O
traffic O
limitation O
measures O
will O
be O
introduced O
. O

" O
It O
would O
only O
create O
confusion O
, O
" O
says O
Gilmozzi B-PER
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
programme O
agreement O
between O
the O
municipalities O
and O
the O
Province B-LOC
establishes O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
central O
administration O
to O
define O
within O
180 O
days O
the O
operating O
lines O
for O

distant O
light O
years O
and O
that O
instead O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Public O
Prosecutor B-ORG
- O
yesterday O
was O
heard O
the O
former O
employer O
of O
Simonetta B-PER
, O
Salvatore B-PER
Volponi I-PER
- O
could O
be O
connected O
to O
each O
other O
by O
a O
red O
thread O
. O

A O
thread O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
identity O
of O
Simonetta B-PER
's O
killer O
, O
a O
man O
she O
knew O
well O
and O
with O
whom O
she O
might O
even O
have O
had O
a O
sentimental O
liason O
. O

But O
there O
is O
more O
: O

the O
pm O
could O
decide O
to O
interrogate O
in O
the O
coming O
weeks O
old O
or O
new O
protagonists O
of O
the O
yellow O
and O
then O
focus O
again O
on O
the O
condominium O
of O
mysteries O
. O

The O
starting O
point O
that O
opens O
a O
new O
chapter O
of O
the O
story O
comes O
from O
a O
book O
not O
yet O
published O
, O
written O
just O
by O
the O
former O
employer O
of O
Cesaroni B-PER
, O
Salvatore B-PER
Volponi I-PER
. O

Aged O
, O
the O
tone O
discharged O
, O
Volponi B-PER
was O
summoned O
yesterday O
to O
the O
Public O
Prosecutor O
's O
Office O
. O

" O
I O
know O
that O
Simonetta B-PER
had O
intertwined O
a O
recent O
relationship O
with O
a O
man O
, O
" O
said O
the O
witness O
who O
was O
accompanied O
to O
Piazzale O
Clodio O
by O
his O
lawyer O
, O
the O
lawyer O
Maria B-PER
Antonietta I-PER
Lamazza I-PER
. O

To O
make O
plausible O
the O
version O
of O
Volponi B-PER
- O
which O
in O
the O
book O
" O
Io O
, O
" O
" O
Smonetta O
" O
and O
" O
Via O
Poma O
" O
also O
tells O
the O
personal O
story O
of O
man O
destroyed O
precisely O
by O
the O
story O
- O
is O
a O
writing O
by O
Simonetta B-PER
Cesaroni I-PER
herself O
that O
has O
been O
revisited O
with O
other O
eyes O
by O
Pm O
Cavallone B-PER
. O

Some O
verses O
of O
a O
song O
by O
Lucio B-PER
Dalla I-PER
guardati O
in O
the O
bag O
would O
suggest O
a O
particular O
emotional O
situation O
of O
the O
girl O
, O
out O
of O
a O
long O
love O
story O
and O
about O
to O
start O
another O
. O

And O
for O
what O
should O
I O
regret O
- O
writes O
Simonetta B-PER
on O
a O
sheet O
found O
in O
the O
purse O
along O
with O
the O
contraceptive O
box O
- O
to O
play O
with O
life O
, O
to O
take O
it O
by O
the O
tail O
? O

One O
day O
it O
will O
have O
to O
end O
, O
so O
I O
've O
already O
thought O
about O
it O
forever O
. O

Eternal O
is O
also O
a O
minute O
, O
every O
kiss O
received O
by O
the O
people O
I O
loved O
. O

But O
it O
is O
from O
the O
DNA O
analysis O
on O
the O
blood O
trail O
, O
to O
the O
examination O
of O
the O
RSI B-ORG
carabinieri O
and O
whose O
results O
will O
be O
known O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
month O
, O
that O
the O
turning O
point O
could O
come O
. O

If O
it O
will O
be O
highlighted O
that O
the O
DNA O
is O
compatible O
with O
that O
of O
Simonetta B-PER
or O
also O
compatible O
with O
that O
of O
a O
third O
person O
( O
the O
killer O
? O
) O
, O
the O
yellow O
of O
via B-LOC
Poma I-LOC
could O
approach O
the O
solution O
. O

The O
blood O
trace O
was O
found O
in O
the O
rooms O
that O
house O
the O
washrooms O
of O
the O
condominium O
of O
Via B-LOC
Poma I-LOC
2 I-LOC
. O

It O
could O
indicate O
that O
right O
there O
the O
killer O
, O
he O
cleaned O
himself O
up O
. O

And O
again O
that O
he O
escaped O
, O
climbing O
in O
the O
elevator O
from O
the O
third O
floor O
( O
even O
in O
the O
cabin O
were O
found O
traces O
of O
blood O
) O
, O
then O
exited O
from O
a O
door O
that O
leads O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
leads O
to O
the O
garages O
. O

In O
short O
, O
one O
who O
knew O
the O
palace O
well O
. O

Finally O
from O
the O
new O
investigation O
would O
emerge O
disturbing O
details O
such O
as O
the O
disappearance O
of O
the O
few O
garments O
found O
on O
the O
corpse O
, O
a O
bra O
and O
a O
bodice O
disappeared O
from O
the O
repertoire O
of O
evidence O
. O

The O
only O
garments O
that O
covered O
Simonetta B-PER
's O
body O
killed O
with O
29 O
stab O
wounds O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
those O
wounds O
the O
face O
tumefied O
, O
sign O
of O
a O
fist O
given O
by O
the O
killer O
and O
a O
bite O
on O
the O
breast O
. O

Sign O
of O
a O
violent O
approach O
of O
his O
new O
love O
ended O
in O
tragedy O
. O

? O
Probably O
the O
Juventus O
fantasist O
will O
couple O
, O
at O
least O
initially O
, O
with O
Gilardino B-PER

Lippi B-PER
proposes O

" O
She O

" O
says O
the O

, O
" O

she O

to O
be O
taken O
care O
of O

" O

CHISINAU B-LOC
( O
Moldavia B-LOC
) O
- O
One O
certainty O
, O
Alessandro B-PER
Del I-PER
Piero I-PER
. O

Without O
revealing O
the O
other O
cards O
, O
at O
his O
blue O
match O
number O
three O
Marcello B-PER
Lippi I-PER
prepares O
to O
invent O
another O
Italy B-PER
, O
the O
third O
. O

Not O
for O
fear O
of O
today O
's O
opponent O
, O
Moldova B-ORG
, O
nor O
only O
for O
the O
many O
repeated O
reasons O
of O
a O
psycho O
- O
physical O
character O
after O
the O
spending O
of O
the O
match O
on O
Saturday O
. O

There O
is O
rather O
- O
he O
explains O
- O
to O
manage O
the O
victory O
against O
Norway B-ORG
and O
work O
for O
the O
future O
. O

Leaving O
the O
first O
combination O
for O
the O
2006 O
World O
Championships O
with O
a O
double O
success O
would O
be O
a O
launch O
ramp O
. O

But O
prepare O
carefully O
the O
next O
flight O
must O
be O
for O
Lippi B-PER
even O
more O
important O
. O

And O
therefore O
, O
out O
of O
a O
talent O
from O
the O
portentous O
exploit O
, O
De B-PER
Rossi I-PER
, O
inside O
a O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
looking O
for O
ransom O
, O
and O
possible O
novelties O
also O
in O
the O
form O
. O

I O
expect O
a O
nice O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
- O
says O
Lippi B-PER
- O
Not O
that O
it O
's O
the O
game O
of O
the O
ransom O
, O
he O
was O
n't O
even O
in O
Iceland B-LOC
... O

But O
Alexander B-PER
arrived O
in O
retreat O
ten O
days O
ago O
as O
everyone O
, O
with O
a O
great O
desire O
to O
do O
well O
, O
and O
in O
a O
certain O
sense O
also O
of O
ransom O
. O

He O
could O
n't O
turn O
her O
into O
a O
field O
for O
an O
injury O
. O

Now O
it O
's O
up O
to O
him O
to O
do O
it O
, O
as O
Saturday O
his O
companions O
are O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
, O
no O
official O
anticipation O
of O
what O
Italy O
will O
be O
. O

I O
confirm O
that O
I O
will O
change O
men O
, O
but O
for O
three O
days O
I O
've O
been O
pounding O
the O
kids O
: O

It O
must O
not O
change O
the O
spirit O
. O

If O
we O
do O
n't O
underestimate O
commitment O
and O
opponent O
, O
you O
can O
win O
. O

Doing O
it O
without O
playing O
well O
, O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
is O
not O
possible O
. O

But O
for O
once O
I O
'd O
settle O
for O
that O
too O
. O

Closing O
these O
first O
10 O
days O
of O
work O
with O
a O
double O
success O
would O
be O
a O
nice O
injection O
of O
confidence O
. O

The O
same O
that O
Lippi B-PER
intends O
to O
give O
to O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
, O
and O
in O
all O
probability O
to O
Gilardino B-PER
. O

According O
to O
the O
philosophy O
of O
many O
- O
his O
explanation O
- O
I O
should O
confirm O
the O
11 O
players O
on O
Saturday O
for O
how O
they O
played O
. O

I O
follow O
another O
path O
, O
and O
someone O
will O
be O
scandalized O
. O

But O
at O
almost O
60 O
years O
old O
and O
with O
35 O
of O
bench O
, O
it O
is O
fair O
to O
think O
that O
if O
a O
young O
man O
has O
given O
so O
much O
, O
beyond O
the O
possibilities O
, O
it O
is O
right O
not O
to O
load O
him O
with O
too O
many O
expectations O
. O

It O
took O
courage O
to O
put O
him O
in O
at O
the O
age O
of O
21 O
, O
it O
takes O
carefulness O
now O
to O
manage O
his O
future O
. O

And O
if O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
another O
young O
man O
has O
suffered O
the O
emotion O
of O
his O
debut O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
reason O
to O
confirm O
it O
... O

Translated O
, O
out O
De B-PER
Rossi I-PER
( O
" O
yes O
, O
if O
we O
talk O
about O
him O
, O
I O
say O
that O
his O
good O
is O
done O
to O
get O
him O
out O
" O
) O
and O
still O
inside O
Gilardino B-PER
. O

Two O
opposing O
choices O
, O
but O
only O
one O
philosophy O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
afford O
to O
have O
eleven O
fixed O
players O
in O
mind O
. O

Between O
championship O
and O
cups O
the O
players O
of O
the O
big O
clubs O
will O
have O
only O
one O
Wednesday O
free O
. O

Today O
's O
football O
is O
more O
difficult O
: O

I O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
having O
a O
team O
of O
30 O
players O
, O
but O
20 O
- O
22 O
yes O
. O

And O
also O
for O
the O
module O
: O

The O
basic O
idea O
is O
there O
, O
adaptable O
to O
the O
players O
available O
. O

That O
's O
why O
it O
may O
change O
. O

Maybe O
... O

Inevitable O
, O
in O
any O
case O
, O
that O
the O
weak O
lights O
of O
the O
Chisinau B-LOC
stadium O
all O
focus O
on O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
also O
true O
for O
him O
- O
Lippi B-PER
is O
closed O
- O
the O
speech O
made O
for O
Totti B-PER
. O

The O
samples O
must O
be O
de O
- O
accounted O
for O
. O

If O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
on O
the O
pedestal O
as O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
it O
is O
good O
for O
Alex B-PER
. O

He O
'd O
climbed O
up O
on O
it O
. O
No O
one O
had O
put O
it O
there O
. O

but O
often O
the O
samples O
are O
helped O
to O
climb O
, O
so O
then O
there O
is O
more O
taste O
to O
bring O
them O
down O
. O

Lippi B-PER
instead O
while O
investing O
in O
the O
mission O
of O
a O
partial O
ransom O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
raise O
it O
beyond O
what O
is O
due O
: O

or O
above O
his O
team O
concept O
. O

So O
it O
is O
even O
possible O
that O
he O
asks O
him O
to O
make O
second O
tip O
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Del B-PER
Piero I-PER
, O
and O
not O
only O
. O

Of O
the O
five O
planned O
changes O
, O
the O
closest O
to O
certainty O
are O
those O
of O
Oddo B-PER

it O
means O
that O
the O
woman O
behind O
the O
wheel O
is O
a O
danger O
to O
herself O
and O
to O
others O
. O

And O
so O
the O
gip O
Marco B-PER
La I-PER
Ganga I-PER
accepted O
the O
request O
of O
the O
pm O
Giuseppe B-PER
De I-PER
Benedetto I-PER
who O
asked O
for O
the O
precautionary O
seizure O
of O
the O
driving O
document O
. O

The O
incident O
dates O
back O
to O
May O
21st O
. O

That O
day O
a O
girl O
who O
is O
taking O
driving O
lessons O
was O
preparing O
to O
get O
into O
the O
school O
car O
to O
practice O
. O

The O
vehicle O
was O
parked O
in O
Corso O
Buonarroti O
near O
the O
crossroads O
with O
Via O
Sant'Antonio O
da O
Trento B-LOC
. O

Just O
as O
the O
poor O
girl O
was O
opening O
the O
car O
door O
, O
a O
Fiat O
Seicento O
hit O
the O
girl O
by O
throwing O
her O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

Under O
the O
eyes O
of O
some O
witnesses O
, O
the O
investor O
did O
not O
stop O
but O
pulled O
right O
. O

While O
the O
girl O
was O
being O
rescued O
and O
transferred O
to O
the O
E.R. O
for O
a O
shoulder O
fracture O
, O
the O
city O
police O
tried O
to O
identify O
the O
pirate O
. O

The O
model O
of O
the O
car O
( O
Fiat O
Seicento O
) O
, O
the O
color O
( O
white O
) O
and O
some O
number O
plates O
, O
carried O
the O
agents O
up O
to O
V. B-PER
M. I-PER
, O
80 O
years O
of O
Trento B-LOC
. O

On O
his O
seventeenth O
century O
there O
were O
still O
the O
unmistakable O
signs O
of O
the O
accident O
. O

The O
woman O
justified O
herself O
claiming O
that O
she O
had O
not O
noticed O
anything O
. O

However O
, O
this O
did O
not O
prevent O
the O
initiation O
of O
an O
administrative O
procedure O
leading O
to O
the O
suspension O
of O
the O
driving O
document O
by O
the O
Government B-ORG
's I-ORG
Commissariat I-ORG
. O

Against O
this O
decision O
the O
lawyer O
of O
the O
lady O
appealed O
to O
the O
judge O
of O
peace O
who O
accepted O
the O
defender O
's O
arguments O
by O
handing O
the O
driving O
licence O
back O
to O
the O
old O
driver O
. O

At O
this O
point O
the O
prosecutor B-ORG
of I-ORG
the O
Republic O
intervened O
that O
on O
the O
event O
had O
opened O
a O
criminal O
procedure O
for O
omission O
of O
rescue O
. O

For O
the O
pm O
Giuseppe B-PER
De I-PER
Benedetto I-PER
it O
was O
not O
difficult O
to O
motivate O
the O
precautionary O
request O
: O

If O
the O
lady O
really O
did O
n't O
realize O
that O
she O
had O
sent O
a O
pedestrian O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
it O
's O
probably O
best O
that O
she O
let O

In O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
a O
new O
Yugoslavia O
is O
likely O
and O
the O
only O
solution O
at O
this O
point O
is O
the O
UN B-ORG
intervention O
. O

There O
are O
complex O
reasons O
for O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
crisis O
, O
but O
the O
massacre O
in O
the O
school O
of O
Beslan B-LOC
is O
a O
pathological O
issue O
, O
to O
be O
put O
in O
the O

of O

inexplicable O
from O

This O
is O

probably O
the O
leading O

Born O
in O

he O
was O
one O
of O

following O
the O

In O

It O
allows O

to O
enter O
into O
the O
complexity O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC

Ethnicism O
and O

There O
are O
many O

the O

In O

this O

has O
never O
had O
a O
real O
Christianization O

Some O
missionaries O
, O
but O
nothing O
more O
. O

When O
Islam O
arrived O
in O
1500 O
it O
found O
a O
pagan O
land O
, O
Bensi B-PER
explains O
. O

But O
in O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
there O
were O
never O
very O
fervent O
Muslims O
, O
to O
the O
point O
that O
during O
Soviet O
domination O
they O
totally O
forgot O
the O
worship O
of O
Allah B-PER
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
talk O
about O
Caucasian O
populations O
in O
bulk O
, O
we O
should O
make O
long O
distinctions O
between O
Kabardini B-PER

Balkari B-PER
, O
Cirassici B-PER

There O
are O
at O

Cecen O

the O

the O
Russians O
clinged O
to O
it O
: O

They O
are O
called O
" O
nokhci O

The O

is O
almost O
the O
only O
literary O
form O
: O

There O
is O
no O
poem O
of O
love O
among O

You O
sing O
the O

you O
exalt O

to O
translate O
for O
a O
Russian O

But O
there O
is O
a O
cross O
" O
caucasity O

, O
which O
starts O
from O
the O
area O
between O
the O
two O
seas O
and O
arrives O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Sardinia B-LOC
, O
passing O
from O
Albania B-LOC

It O
is O
a O
code O
of O
honor O
where O
weakness O
is O
not O
allowed O
and O
every O
wrong O
must O
be O
avenged O

A O
Story O
of O
Rivalry O

Between O
these O
populations O
and O
the O
Russians O
there O
has O
always O
been O
a O
more O
or O
less O
strong O
rivalry O
. O

But O
in O
the O
early O
1800s O
the O
situation O
degenerated O
into O
war O
as O
Russia B-LOC
tried O
to O
expand O
to O
the O
Indian B-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
. O

The O
Caucasians O
resisted O
for O
several O
years O
: O

from O
1820 O
to O
1859 O
. O

In O
1830 O
an O
Islamic O
imam O
, O
Shamil B-PER
, O
proclaimed O
a O
manatee O
: O

an O
Islamic O
state O
that O
opposed O
a O
unique O
resistance O
to O
the O
Russians O
before O
capitulating O
. O

To O
be O
less O
hostile O
to O
the O
rulers O
were O
some O
Caucasians O
of O
the O
north O
, O
including O
, O
indeed O
, O
the O
Ossites O
. O

Here O
is O
the O
remote O
origin O
of O
the O
rivalry O
between O
Cecen O
and O
Ossites O
: O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
difference O
of O
religion O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
North B-LOC
Ossetia I-LOC
have O
favored O
Russian O
domination O
- O
Bensi B-PER
emphasizes O
- O
an O
unforgivable O
fault O
, O
which O
the O
Ossites O
drag O
to O
the O
present O
day O
. O

But O
the O
real O
tragedy O
of O
the O
people O
of O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
was O
Stalinist O
Russia B-LOC
. O

In O
' O
17 O
, O
taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
confusion O
of O
the O
Russian O
revolution O
, O
the O
peoples O
of O
the O
Caucasus B-LOC
tried O
the O
path O
of O
independence O
: O

Russia B-LOC
harshly O
repressed O
. O

All O
territories O
were O
regained O
by O
force O
. O

During O
World O
War O
II O
, O
when O
Hitler B-PER
broke O
into O
Russia B-LOC
, O
the O
Cecens O
hoped O
for O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Stalinist O
regime O
and O
supported O
the O
Nazi O
raid O
. O

This O
was O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
Stalin B-PER
was O
ruthless O
. O

The O
deportation O
of O
' O
44 O
. O

" O
Stalin B-PER
, O
as O
a O
good O
Georgian O
, O
had O
a O
particular O
abhorrence O
for O
those O
who O
from O
his O
point O
of O
view O
were O
only O
crude O
mountaineers O
- O
says O
Bensi B-PER
- O
the O
deportation O
to O
Siberia B-LOC
was O
organized O
from O
1944 O
. O

For O
the O
transport O
they O
used O
freight O
wagons O
where O
men O
women O
and O
children O
ended O
up O
, O
many O
died O
already O
during O
the O
journey O

In O
total O
the O
victims O
were O
1,600,000 O
of O
which O
at O
least O
600,000 O
Chechens O

The O
survivors O
could O
return O
home O
only O
after O
the O
20th O
Congress O
of O
the O
Communist B-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
where O
Nikita B-PER
Chruschev I-PER
in O
1956 O
denounced O
Stalin B-PER
's O
faults O
. O

Almost O
all O
current O
Chechen O
leaders O
were O
born O
during O
deportation O
: O

This O
can O
explain O
the O
anger O
that O
you O
live O
in O
Checheny B-LOC

In O
1993 O
, O
after O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Berlin B-LOC
Wall O
, O
the O
only O
Chechen O

born O

managed O
to O
join O
the O

, O
proclaimed O
independence O

Shortly O
thereafter O
, O
December O
1994 O
, O

broke O
out O
. O

The O
rest O
is O
news O
of O
the O
present O
day O
, O
an O
escalation O
of O
violence O
. O

In O
1996 O
the O
first O
Chechen O
war O
ended O
with O
independence O
in O
the O

Here O
came O
Chechen O

, O
the O
one O
that O
blew O
up O
the O

in O
Volgodonsk B-LOC

In O
response O
, O
Putin B-PER
declared O
the O
war O
that O
continues O
to O
this O
day O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
particular O
still O
that O
is O
not O
explained O
except O
looking O
back O
: O

Why O
the O
Beslan B-LOC
school O
? O

It O
's O
not O
random O
at O
all O
. O

Some O
say O
the O
terrorists O
chose O
it O
because O
they O
found O
officials O
to O
bribe O
. O

But O
it O
is O
located O
in O
Ossetia B-LOC

precisely O
and O
in O
an O
area O
disputed O
after O
the O
end O
of O

Birth O
of O

But O
the O
deadly O
humus O
, O
to O
give O
birth O
to O
terrorism O
, O
where O
was O
it O
? O

At O
some O
point O
the O
Chechens O
remembered O
to O
be O
Muslims O
. O

Already O
during O
the O
era O
of O
Gorbachev B-PER
they O
made O
contact O
with O
Islamic O
fundamentalists O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC

with O
the O
Taliban O

But O
Chechen O
Islam O
is O
deeply O
instrumental O

Emblematic O
was O
the O
statement O
of O
Chechen O
President O
Dudajev B-PER
: O
" O
I O
am O
Muslim O
, O
but O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
understood O
the O

Inability O
of O
Russia B-LOC
to O
handle O
the O
situation O
: O

the O
economic O
interests O

? O

The O
solution O
will O
certainly O
not O
come O
from O
the O
Russia B-LOC
of O
Valdimir B-PER
Putin I-PER
that O
no O
longer O
dialogues O
even O
with O
moderate O
Chechens B-PER

has O
promised O
even O
more O
hardness O
in O
the O

In O
addition O
to O
historical O
considerations O

it O
is O
important O
to O
look O
at O
the O

There O

while O
integration O
will O
be O
handed O
over O

the O
Council B-ORG
offices O
by O

This O
will O
make O
it O
possible O
to O
earn O
a O
week O
for O
the O
debate O
in O
the O
Chamber O
. O

After O
the O
deposit O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
Regulation O
provides O
for O
a O
period O
of O
14 O
days O
before O
the O
discussion O
in O
the O
Council O
. O

Thus O
the O
session O
of O
28 O
September O
will O
deal O
with O
subjects O
of O
ordinary O
administration O
, O
while O
the O
29th O
will O
open O
the O

with O
the O

Alessandro B-PER
Andreatta I-PER

the O
chairman O
of O
the O

Agostino B-PER
Bitteleri I-PER
. O

It O
will O
be O
their O
turn O
to O
draw O
the O
overall O
picture O
of O
the O
variant O
, O
explain O
the O
objectives O
of O
the O
review O
that O
will O
take O
place O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
illustrate O
the O
path O
taken O
by O
the O
offices O
and O
the O
commission B-ORG
, O
present O
the O
criteria O
by O
which O
the O
private O
individuals O
' O
applications O
have O
been O
evaluated O
. O

The O
following O
week O
, O
from O
5 O
to O
7 O
October O
( O
but O
realistically O
, O
it O
will O
be O
up O
to O
8 O
and O
perhaps O
the O
following O
sessions O
) O
will O
be O
the O
stage O
of O
discussion O
and O
approval O
. O

Therefore O
, O
by O
the O
middle O
of O
next O
month O
the O
process O
of O
the O
first O
adoption O
should O
be O
concluded O
. O

Follow O
the O
usual O
60 O
days O
for O
observations O
and O
return O
to O
court O
for O
final O
approval O
. O

Then O
, O
in O
order O
for O
the O
interventions O
included O
in O
the O
variant O
to O
actually O
be O
carried O
out O
, O
it O
will O
serve O
the O
visa O
of O
the O
provincial B-ORG
junta I-ORG
, O
which O
has O
one O
year O
to O
read O
all O
the O
documentation O
. O

The O
escamotage O
of O
depositing O
the O
resolution O
in O
separate O
times O
will O
avoid O
the O
awkwardness O
of O
the O
mega O
amendment O
that O
- O
in O
the O
intentions O
of O
several O
members O
- O
would O
have O
been O
necessary O
to O
re O
- O
examine O
all O
the O
applications O
remaining O
excluded O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
amendments O
, O
the O
group O
heads O
gave O
themselves O
a O
date O
( O
on O
29 O
September O
) O
as O
the O
deadline O
for O
the O
submission O
of O
amending O
texts O
of O
the O
resolution O
. O

In O
theory O
, O
no O
rule O
imposes O
an O
ultimatum O
for O
their O
deposit O
, O
but O
the O
group O
leaders O
have O
signed O
this O
sort O
of O
agreement O
between O
gentlemen O
to O
enable O
the O
offices O
to O
carry O
out O
a O
quick O
investigation O
of O
any O
new O
questions O
included O
in O
the O
amendments O
. O

Then O
, O
on O
30 O
September O
, O
the O
Committee B-ORG
on I-ORG
Town I-ORG
and O
Country O
Planning O
will O
meet O
again O
to O
discuss O
these O
changes O
. O

Unless O
, O
by O
that O
date O
, O
the O
thorny O
issues O
of O

have O

The O
questions O
underlying O
the O
debate O
were O
: O

What O
kind O
of O
trend O
do O
the O
television O
communities O
reveal O
for O
the O
evolution O
of O
television O
media O
and O
communication O
in O
general O
? O

After O
having O
considered O
television O
for O
decades O
as O
a O
factor O
of O
homologation O
and O
globalization O
, O
are O
we O
faced O
with O
a O
rediscovery O
of O
a O
local O
dimension O
of O
communication O
? O

The O
round O
table O
began O
with O
Massimo B-PER
Arvat I-PER
's O
communication O
that O
brought O
his O
experience O
as O
a O
community O
television O
producer O
in O
Piedmont B-LOC
. O

There O
the O
local O
communities O
managed O
to O
create O
a O
" O
popular O
" O
network O
- O
born O
first O
with O
simple O
citizens O
, O
then O
by O
environmental O
associations O
and O
then O
by O
a O
varied O
group O
of O
spontaneous O
associations O
and O
groups O
- O
giving O
rise O
to O
a O
daily O
programming O
of O
half O
an O
hour O
that O
was O
also O
broadcast O
by O
provincial O
TVs O
. O

The O
model O
was O
realized O
in O
a O
talk O
show O
that O
dealt O
with O
problems O
related O
to O
the O
territory O
and O
that O
was O
realized O
in O
a O
public O
place O
. O

" O
Television O
- O
said O
the O
producer O
- O
is O
a O
tool O
that O
must O
serve O
first O
and O
foremost O
to O
communicate O
people O
. O
" O

People O
who O
are O
different O
but O
who O
precisely O
through O
the O
community O

create O

Andrea B-PER
Melodia I-PER
spoke O
about O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
television O
model O
and O
its O
perspectives O
: O

from O
his O
debut O
that O
saw O
him O
as O
the O
creator O
of O
mass O
communication O
, O
to O
the O
attempt O
of O
the O
seventies O
of O
decentralisation O
( O
with O
the O
birth O
and O
then O
death O
of O
the O
Rai B-ORG
regional O
offices O
) O
to O
the O
scenarios O
of O
tomorrow O
's O
TV O
that O
will O
no O
longer O
be O
articulated O
in O
channels O
but O
if O
anything O
managed O
by O
links O
. O

The O
trend O
will O
then O
be O
that O
of O
a O
television O
with O
universal O
coverage O
that O
lives O
thanks O
to O
a O
universal O
production O
. O

These O
networks O
- O
it O
has O
concluded O
Melodia B-PER
- O
will O
have O
all O
the O
more O
long O
life O
as O
they O
will O
know O
how O
to O
interact O
with O
each O
other O
. O

Marco B-PER
Nolli I-PER

about O
his O
experience O

of O
the O

communities O
- O
what O
are O
called O
elsewhere O
, O
many O
effectively O
Tele O

. O

These O
are O
very O
interesting O
experiences O
but O
they O
often O
have O
a O
short O
life O
and O
end O
with O
a O
great O
dissipation O
of O
energies O
. O

The O
Superstudent O
project O
in O
Trento B-LOC
- O
said O
Nolli B-PER
- O
will O
be O

about O
her O

in O
the O
field O
of O

According O
to O
the O
scholar O
community O

can O
be O
important O
experiences O

with O

some O

the O
various O

The O

explains O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Alessandro B-PER
Rossi I-PER
School O
, O
expert O
in O
public O
procurement O
- O
is O
an O
important O
signal O
: O

is O
the O
demonstration O
that O
when O
public O
and O
private O
want O
to O
collaborate O
they O
can O
carry O
out O
significant O
interventions O
and O
in O
a O
very O
fast O
time O
. O

The O
balance O
sheet O
of O
the O
operation O
is O
in O
surplus O
because O
against O
a O
total O
expenditure O
that O
is O
certainly O
not O
derisory O
, O
all O
the O
costs O
that O
would O
have O
resulted O
in O
the O
prolonged O
closure O
of O
the O
asylum O
( O
works O
of O
this O
entity O
contracted O
by O
the O
public O

a O

of O

of O
the O
102 O

the O

The O
square O
of O
the O

was O
obtained O
thanks O
to O
the O

practically O
in O

In O
this O

we O
were O
able O

that O

the O

The O

ancient O

Over O

a O

to O

- O
warns O

- O
because O
, O
in O

There O
is O
only O
one O

it O
is O

This O
year O
there O
is O
one O
more O
reason O
to O
run O
to O
the O

. O

The O
influenza O
also O
protects O
against O
the O
risk O
of O
avian O
influenza O
( O
that O
of O

) O
in O
the O
unfortunate O
hypothesis O
that O
it O
will O
become O
a O

. O

ON O
THE O
WAY O
THE O
CAMPAIGN O
: O

Councillor B-ORG
and O
Health B-ORG
Company I-ORG
have O
planned O
this O
year O
a O
drum O
- O
beating O
information O
, O
to O
convince O
more O
than O
65 O
years O
to O
vaccinate O
. O

Our O
commitment O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
major O
diseases O
are O
addressed O
in O
a O
general O
context O
of O
health O
prevention O
- O
says O
Councillor O
Andreolli B-PER
- O
For O
the O
influence O
the O
objective O
to O
be O
achieved O
is O
to O
protect O
70 O
% O
of O
the O
elderly O
population O
. O

The O
health B-ORG
care I-ORG
company I-ORG
purchased O
70,000 O
doses O
of O
vaccine O
and O
invested O
33.500 O
euros O
for O
information O
. O

In O
Trentino B-LOC
the O
membership O
is O
good O
, O
last O
year O
we O
vaccinated O
64,000 O
people O
, O
that O
is O
a O
little O
less O
than O
60 O
% O
of O
the O
over O
65 O
years O
- O
Valter B-PER
Carraro I-PER
, O
responsible O
for O
public O
hygiene O
- O
informs O
. O

But O
it O
's O
not O
enough O
, O
you O
have O
to O
vaccinate O
older O
people O
and O
even O
more O
people O
at O
risk O
under O
65 O
years O
old O
. O

VACCINATIONS O
FROM O
25 O
, O

the O
start O
throughout O
the O
provincial O
territory O
will O
take O
place O
in O
the O
last O
week O
of O
October O
. O

First O
, O
from O
18 O
to O
23 O
October O
, O
instead O
, O
will O
be O
vaccinated O
people O
born O
in O
1934 O
and O
in O
1935 O
, O
to O
whom O
by O
letter O
will O
also O
be O
offered O
free O
vaccination O
against O
pneumonia O
and O
other O
invasive O
pneumococcal O
diseases O
. O

Vaccinations O
are O
carried O
out O
in O
public O
health O
clinics O
in O
the O
health O
district O
; O

each O
district O
will O
inform O
with O
notices O
on O
which O
days O
and O
at O
which O
times O
the O
vaccinations O
will O
be O
carried O
out O
. O

There O
is O
time O
until O
the O
end O
of O
November O
. O

FAMILY O
MEDICALS O
: O

the O
real O
novelty O
of O
this O
year O
is O
that O
vaccination O
can O
also O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
family O
doctor O
. O

" O
We O
start O
with O
some O
doctors O
who O
have O
given O
their O
availability O
- O
explains O
Fabio B-PER
Branz I-PER
, O
president O
of O
the O
Order B-ORG
of I-ORG
Doctors I-ORG
- O
but O
already O
next O
year O
this O
activity O
of O
vaccination O
of O
the O
assisted O
will O
become O
systematic O
" O
. O

Family O
doctors O
have O
so O
far O
ensured O
that O
patients O
unable O
to O
move O
are O
vaccinated O
at O
home O
; O

the O
new O
arrangements O
will O
seek O
to O
ensure O
that O
vaccination O
of O
people O
at O
risk O
becomes O
one O
of O
the O
therapies O
that O
the O
family O
doctor O
carries O
out O
routine O
. O

In O
this O
way O
it O
is O
hoped O
to O
give O
a O
further O
boost O
to O
the O
vaccination O
activity O
: O

The O
patient O
relying O
on O
his O
doctor O
's O
advice O
will O
certainly O
have O
more O
ease O
, O
but O
also O
more O
comfort O
, O
to O
adhere O
. O

Since O
1996 O
the O
number O
of O
over O
65 O
vaccinees O
against O
influenza O
has O
doubled O
, O
from O
32,286 O
to O
63,360 O
in O
2003 O
. O

But O
there O
are O
also O
10,000 O
Trentinos O
who O
, O
although O
not O
considered O
at O
risk O
, O
do O
not O
want O
to O
know O
to O
take O
the O
flu O
and O
buy O
the O
vaccine O
at O
the O
pharmacy O
. O

INFORMATION O
: O

is O
entrusted O
to O
1,500 O
posters O
and O
70,000 O
folds O
distributed O
in O
hospitals O

Nuzzo B-PER
explains O
the O
situation O

Of O
ANDREA B-PER
COBBE I-PER

TRENTO B-LOC
- O
In O
the O
group O
that O
is O
training O
under O
the O
orders O
of O
Silvano B-PER
Prandi I-PER
there O
is O
also O
a O
player O
" O
invisible O
" O
, O
physically O
in O
the O
gym O
with O
the O
companions O
, O
regularly O
registered O
for O
Trentino B-ORG
Volley I-ORG
, O
with O
a O
contract O
valid O
for O
another O
season O
, O
but O
that O
in O
fact O
does O
not O
exist O
. O

In O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
company O
has O
put O
it O
out O
pink O
and O
waits O
only O
for O
the O
opportunity O
to O
yield O
it O
. O

He O
is O
Gianluca B-PER
Nuzzo I-PER
, O
the O
opposite O
that O
up O
to O
5 O
years O
ago O
rivaled O
for O
quality O
and O
quantity O
with O
the O
equal O
Italian O
and O
foreign O
roles O
of O
the O
highest O
series B-ORG
and O
that O
today O
is O
in O
a O
situation O
not O
enviable O
, O
because O
, O
after O
Itas B-ORG
took O
the O
Slovak O
Chocholak B-PER
, O
he O
was O
invited O
to O
look O
for O
another O
team O
. O

Already O
- O
says O
Gianluca B-PER
- O
but O
a O
formation O
that O
is O
to O
my O
liking O
. O

This O
was O
the O
only O
condition O
that O
I O
have O
put O
to O
the O
president O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
summer O
and O
since O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
arrived O
convincing O
offers O
for O
now O
I O
remain O
waiting O
. O

With O
Trentino B-ORG
Volley I-ORG
there O
's O
a O
frank O
relationship O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
in O
the O
way O
when O
Silvano B-PER
told O
me O
the O
choices O
made O
by O
the O
company O
, O
but O
if O
I O
'm O
still O
here O
it O
's O
because O
Forlì B-ORG
and O
Corigliano B-ORG
did O
n't O
seem O
happy O
choices O
to O
me O
. O

Does O
that O
mean O
you O
decided O
not O
to O
go O
down O
to O
A2 B-ORG
? O

No O
, O
it O
just O
means O
that O
my O
goal O
is O
to O
see O
the O
conditions O
guaranteed O
by O
the O
contract O
in O
place O
with O
Trentino B-ORG
Volley I-ORG
. O

And O
it O
's O
a O
contract O
from O
A1 B-ORG
in O
every O
part O
of O
it O
. O

Yet O
Corigliano B-ORG
had O
officially O
announced O
your O
purchase O
. O

It O
seemed O
like O
a O
happy O
choice O
, O
an O
Apulian O
coming O
home O
in O
search O
of O
ransom O
. O

" O
The O
company O
was O
very O
reckless O
to O
report O
that O
the O
transaction O
had O
been O
successful O
. O

I O
had O
told O
the O
President O
from O
the O
beginning O
that O
even O
if O
he O
had O
found O
the O
agreement O
with O
Trento B-ORG
, O
the O
last O
word O
would O
be O
mine O
. O

Corigliano B-ORG
is O
a O
neopromossa O
, O
still O
has O
to O
make O
bones O
at O
these O
levels O
. O

If O
I O
'm O
going O
down O
to O
A2 B-ORG
I O
'd O
like O
to O
do O
it O
for O
an O
ambitious O
club O
. O

Did O
you O
get O
any O
offers O
from O
abroad O
? O

A O
Japanese O
prosecutor O
came O
forward O
and O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
repeat O
the O
adventure O
in O
a O
team O
in O
that O
country O
. O

I O
immediately O
gave O
my O
availability O
, O
but O
then O
nothing O
was O
done O
about O
it O
because O
each O
club O
had O
already O
chosen O
its O
own O
only O
foreigner O
. O

Of B-PER
Pinto I-PER
, O
who O
has O
always O
been O
your O
admirer O
, O
did O
n't O
he O
ask O
you O
to O
return O
to O
Taranto B-ORG
? O

Three O
seasons O
ago O
the O
experience O
went O
well O
. O

You O
dropped O
very O
well O
as O
a O
crusher O
and O
in O
Trento B-LOC
you O
were O
also O
awarded O
the O
Mvp O
prize O
. O

It O
's O
true O
, O
that O
was O
the O
best O
season O
I O
played O
after O
the O
injury O
. O

But O
after O
that O
championship O
the O
company O
failed O
and O
we O
lost O
almost O
all O
the O
monthly O
that O
it O
owed O
us O
... O

Today O
they O
have O
a O
good O
team O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
resources O
to O
invest O
on O
the O
bench O
too O
. O

We O
return O
serenely O
to O
the O
past O
season O
. O

Trento B-LOC
seemed O
the O
right O
place O
to O
go O
back O
to O
playing O
opposite O
without O
great O
pressure O
. O

What O
happened O
instead O
? O

Well O
, O
leaving O
out O
the O
shoulder O
injury O
that O
held O
me O
down O
for O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
, O
it O
happened O
that O
I O
played O
very O
little O
. O

Staying O
on O
the O
bench O
is O
penalising O
, O
because O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
habit O
of O
playing O
with O
your O
mates O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
certain O
automatisms O
, O
in O
the O
field O
then O
you O
feel O
lost O
. O

In O
the O
playoffs O
, O
moreover O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
in O
a O
sestetto O
reinvented O
for O
half O
, O
almost O
never O
tested O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
hard O
to O
do O
more O
. O

The O
difference O
between O
us O
and O
Perugia B-ORG
was O
all O
there O
, O
they O
were O
a O
team O
we O
were O
n't O
. O

What O
happens O
now O
? O

I O
'm O
training O
with O
the O
kids O
. O

I O
put O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
into O
it O
because O
I O
know O
it O
's O
for O
me O
and O
them O
. O

I O
realize O
that O
Trentino B-ORG
Volley I-ORG
is O
making O
an O
economic O
sacrifice O
, O
because O
in O
fact O
it O
has O
an O
extra O
player O
at O
its O
expense O
, O
but O
when O
it O
reopens O
the O
market O
( O
after O
3 O
a O
day O
) O
I O
plan O
to O
find O
a O
new O
accommodation O
. O

In O
my O
situation O
I O
only O
have O
to O
navigate O
on O
sight O
. O

Binjip O
, O
the O
tender O
little O
leprechaun O
who O
makes O
empty O

live O

Life O
is O
made O
of O
the O
same O
subject O
of O
dreams O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
has O
the O
same O
consistency O
and O
volatility O
, O
theorized O
substantially O
Shakespeare B-PER
in O
" O
The O
Storm O
" O
, O
suggesting O
to O
many O
other O
artists O
reflections O
of O
great O
suggestion O
that O
have O
dilated O
, O
refined O
and O
multiplied O
with O
the O
affirmation O
of O
psychoanalysis O
( O
where O
dreams O
often O
enclose O
the O
explanations O
of O
reality O
) O
and O
, O
more O
generally O
, O
the O
expressions O
of O
modern O
culture O
( O
scientific O
and O
not O
) O
that O
explore O
the O
latencies O
, O
what O
has O
a O
strong O
cognitive O
charge O
but O
that O
we O
keep O
( O
more O
or O
less O
willingly O
) O
hidden O
, O
the O
border O
territories O
of O
consciences O
and O
cultures O
where O
making O
clarity O
is O
improbable O
if O
not O
impossible O
. O

On O
this O
land O
full O
of O
pitfalls O
has O
ventured O
the O
good O
Korean O
director O
Kim B-PER

- O
duk O
with O
his O
last O
feature O
film O
" O
Binjip O
" O
( O
Empty O

entered O
in O
competition O
as O
" O
surprise O
film O
" O
, O
an O
unprecedented O
vezzo O
for O
the O
Exhibition O
. O

Ki O
- O
duk O
, O
who O
has O
received O
numerous O
international O
awards O
and O
who O
in O
the O
past O
in O
Venice O
received O
a O
prize O
for O
" O
The O
island O
" O
( O
an O
exciting O
story O
of O
loneliness O
, O
violence O
and O
sex O
) O
tells O
in O
a O
firm O
way O
a O
fairy O
tale O
for O
adults O
rich O
in O
metaphorical O
stimuli O
with O
nuanced O
meanings O
that O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
be O
interpreted O
by O
the O
spectator O
; O

In O
this O
way O
, O
pushing O
him O
to O
venture O
into O
the O
shadow O
areas O
and O
to O
accept O
- O
as O
he O
explicitly O
writes O
before O
the O
credits O
- O
that O
of O
the O
things O
of O
the O
world O
we O
can O
only O
say O
that O
we O
do O
not O
know O
if O
they O
are O
dreams O
or O
realities O
, O
illusions O
or O
concrete O
experiences O
. O

The O
protagonist O
( O
which O
significantly O
never O
speaks O
) O
is O
a O
young O
man O
of O
many O
qualities O
who O
spends O
every O
night O
in O
homes O
left O
momentarily O
empty O
( O
even O
just O
for O
a O
few O
days O
for O
a O
business O
trip O
and O
a O
holiday O
) O
by O
those O
who O
normally O
live O
in O
them O
. O

In O
each O
house O
he O
behaves O
as O
if O
it O
were O
his O
definitive O
dwelling O
, O
puts O
everything O
in O
order O
, O
repairs O
how O
faulty O
it O
is O
, O
fills O
them O
with O
heat O
and O
imagination O
. O

In O
this O
pilgrimage O
she O
enters O
a O
noble O
house O
where O
there O
is O
an O
unhappy O
woman O
, O
with O
her O
face O
marked O
by O
her O
husband O
's O
beatings O
. O

Almost O
as O
a O
generous O
leprechaun O
makes O
her O
feel O
different O
, O
respected O
and O
loved O
. O

She O
decides O
to O
follow O
him O
in O
his O
visits O
to O
fireplaces O
that O
often O
contain O
loneliness O
, O
misunderstandings O
and O
bitterness O
. O

They O
are O
discovered O
and O
he O
ends O
up O
in O
prison O
; O

Cops O
and O
cops O
are O
n't O
cute O
. O

But O
the O
young O
man O
learns O
to O
be O
physically O
present O
without O
being O
seen O
by O
others O
, O
except O
by O
the O
woman O
he O
has O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
and O
who O
loves O
him O
. O

Perhaps O
happiness O
or O
, O
less O
ambitiously O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
deal O
serenely O
with O
existence O
implies O
precisely O
to O
take O
possession O
of O
how O
much O
we O
are O
able O
to O
grasp O
around O
and O
within O
us O
, O
not O
to O
emphasize O
physical O
reality O
, O
to O
reinvent O
it O
with O
feelings O
and O
subjective O
creativity O
, O
to O
live O
life O
fully O
animating O
it O
even O
with O
desires O
, O
hopes O
and O
dreams O
. O

An O
extraordinary O
work O
of O
great O
charm O
that O
the O
director O
has O
been O
able O
to O
put O
on O
stage O
effectively O
linking O
it O
also O
with O
some O
concrete O
aspects O
of O
the O
daily O
life O
of O
his O
country O
. O

of O
Estonian O

that O
a O
young O
American O

has O
convinced O
to O
reach O
Palestine B-LOC

are O
sold O
and O

to O
prostitute O
themselves O

first O
in O
the O
territories O
governed O
by O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
authorities I-LOC

then O
in O
those O
of O
Israel B-LOC

Palestine B-LOC
, O
seems O
to O
want O
to O
highlight O
the O
director O
, O
is O
not O
promised O
land O
neither O
for O
the O
Jews O
nor O
for O
these O
girls O
treated O
as O
if O
they O
were O
things O
( O
the O
call O
to O
the O
lagers O
and O
Kapòs O
and O
remarked O
on O
several O
occasions O
) O
. O

True O
to O
his O
style O
, O
Gitai B-PER
alternates O
long O
sequences O
filmed O
with O
the O
moving O
machine O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
used O
by O
hand O
, O
with O
the O
fragmented O
images O
in O
their O
course O
that O
purposely O
make O
the O
viewer O
uncomfortable O
, O
with O
planes O
sequence O
in O
which O
the O
words O
of O
the O
characters O
come O
to O
assume O
the O
descriptive O
hardness O
of O
their O
moods O
and O
their O
conditions O
. O

An O
interesting O
and O
engaging O
work O
, O
although O
too O
repetitive O
and O
insistent O
in O
language O
and O
thematicization O
. O

We O
were O
personally O
more O
than O

probably O
would O
like O
to O
be O
a O
paradoxical O
and O
merciless O
satire O
of O
the O
other O
America B-PER

the O
one O
that O
does O
not O
cultivate O
aspirations O
of O
success O

and O
that O
tries O
to O
redeem O
its O
frustrations O
with O
radical O
choices O
such O
as O
those O
of O
becoming O
a O
mother O

of O

" O
We O
always O
talk O
about O
the O
two O
world O
wars O
, O
the O
first O
and O
the O
second O
, O
and O
we O
forget O
that O
there O
was O
a O
third O

, O
the O
Cold O
War O
- O
explains O
the O
Cardinal O
- O
A O
real O
war O

even O
if O
outside O

And O
this O
is O
yet O
another O
war O
, O
the O
Fourth O
World O
War O
, O
that O
really O
involves O
us O
all O
, O
because O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
coming O
out O
of O
this O

will O
happen O
to O
us O
anything O

The O
cardinal O
emphasizes O
the O
role O
that O
the O
UN B-ORG

play O

On O
several O
occasions O
the O

recalled O
that O
the O
status O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
provides O
all O
the O
means O
to O
deal O
jointly O
with O
the O
dangers O
that O
put O

As O
long O
as O
the O
states O
want O
it O
. O

The O
members O
of O

could O
meet O
for O
example O
to O
see O
together O
how O
to O
tackle O
new O

But O
I O
believe O
that O
it O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
go O
beyond O
the O
perimeter O
of O
the O
permanent O
and O
rotating O
members O
of O

The O

, O
are O
instead O
the O
operators O
of O
the O
Consorzio B-ORG

, O
which O
was O
entrusted O
with O
the O
administrative O
acceptance O
of O
patients O
who O
access O
the O
emergency O
room O
. O

At O
St. O
Clare O
the O
hostesses O
are O
not O
new O
, O
in O
fact O
they O
have O
been O
working O
at O
the O
information B-ORG
and I-ORG
reception I-ORG
center I-ORG
( O
Cirp B-ORG
) O
in O
the O
atrium O
of O
the O
hospital O
. O

The O
new O
operators O
will O
cover O
two O
shifts O
, O
distributed O
between O
8 O
and O
20 O
hours O
, O
with O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
overlap O
for O
the O
passage O
of O
deliveries O
. O

Currently O
they O
are O
doing O
the O
insertion O
, O
alongside O
the O
experienced O
nurses O
of O
the O
acceptance O
. O

With O
14 O
they O
should O
already O
be O
autonomous O
in O
order O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
administrative O
activity O
- O
explains O
the O
primary O
, O
Pierluigi B-PER
Torboli I-PER
- O
so O
that O
the O
nurses O
of O
the O
triage O
can O
carry O
out O
in O
a O
wider O
way O
their O
specific O
competence O
. O

Hostesses O
will O
only O
be O
able O
to O
make O
administrative O
acceptance O
, O
i.e. O
collect O
the O
patient O
's O
personal O
data O
and O
fill O
in O
the O
acceptance O
form O
, O
with O
the O
method O
of O
arrival O
, O
the O
origin O
, O
the O
type O
of O
accident O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
red O
codes O
that O
enter O
the O
emergency O
room O
directly O
and O
other O
patients O
who O
have O
special O
symptoms O
( O
chest O
pain O
, O
fainting O
, O
difficulty O
breathing O
) O
or O
who O
arrive O
in O
the O
stretcher O
and O
go O
straight O
to O
the O
triage O
- O
continues O
Torboli B-PER
- O
are O
excluded O
. O

But O
all O
the O
others O
make O
first O
administrative O
acceptance O
. O

In O
this O
first O
phase O
, O
the O
hostesses O
of O
acceptance O
will O
be O
sacrificed O
in O
the O
space O
now O
assigned O
to O
the O
goalkeepers O
. O

The O
big O
problem O
we O
have O
is O
space O
- O
says O
Torboli B-PER
- O
. O

Unfortunately O
until O
there O
is O
a O
complete O
renovation O
of O
the O
emergency O
room O
, O
in O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
, O
there O
is O
no O
solution O
. O

After O
that O
, O
it O
's O
gon O
na O
be O
a O
whole O
other O
thing O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
attempts O
are O
being O
made O
to O
rationalise O
access O
, O
even O
by O
agreeing O
new O
procedures O
with O
the O
primary O
of O
118 B-ORG
for O
patients O
arriving O
in O
the O
ambulance O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
administrative O
part O
, O
the O
entrusting O
of O
this O
activity O
to O
the O
hostesses O
meets O
a O
request O
made O
precisely O
by O
the O
nurses O
, O
and O
which O
has O
seen O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
director O
of O
the O
hospital O
Baldantoni B-PER
. O

The O
big O
result O
that O
we O
think O
we O
get O
is O
the O
extra O
time O
that O
the O
nurses O
of O
the O
triage O
will O
be O
able O
to O
dedicate O
to O
the O
patients O
who O
are O
waiting O
to O
be O
seen O
- O
concludes O
Torboli B-PER
- O
. O

We O
will O
be O
able O
to O
anticipate O
some O
procedures O
and O
times O
of O
sending O
patients O
. O

The O
relapse O
will O
certainly O
be O
good O
, O
both O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
nurse O
's O
work O
and O
for O
the O
patient O
who O
will O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
be O
rechecked O
and O
will O
see O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
performance O
improved O
during O
the O
waiting O
period O
. O

A O
further O
step O
will O
see O
the O
assignment O
of O
some O
Oss O
operators O
to O
follow O
people O
waiting O
to O
complete O
the O
investigations O
or O

said O
Renzo B-PER
De I-PER
Stefani I-PER
, O

protected O
space O
, O
where O
for O
once O
the O
walls O
erected O
between O
operators O
and O
patients O
fall O
. O

It O
wants O
to O
be O
the O
keystone O
to O
ensure O
that O
everyone O
can O
learn O
from O
everyone O
, O
so O
that O
everyone O

a O
positive O
contribution O
to O
working O
together O
to O
build O
something O
. O

Yesterday O
afternoon O
he O
gave O
space O
to O
the O
protagonists O
, O
to O
those O
who O
live O
in O
first O
person O
the O
experience O
of O
mental O
illness O
. O

This O

Ron B-PER
Coleman I-PER
, O
author O

the O
book O
" O
Healing O
from O
Mental O
Evil O
" O
, O
and O
a O
handbook O
for O
" O
Hearings O
of O
Voices O
" O
. O

He O
too O
patient O
, O
told O
of O
his O
experience O
as O
a O
stuffed O
sick O
person O
, O
left O
essentially O
to O
himself O
and O
the O
drugs O
. O

Coleman B-PER
stressed O
that O
in O
order O
to O
be O
better O
, O
the O
patient O
needs O
to O
speak O
, O
to O
be O
heard O
, O
to O
find O
an O
attentive O
interlocutor O
who O
has O
the O
patience O
to O
pay O
attention O
. O

Numerous O
patients O
were O
present O
who O
wanted O
to O
bring O
their O
experience O
to O
share O
it O
with O
others O
. O

From O
their O
stories O
emerged O
a O
situation O
of O
deep O
initial O
discomfort O
not O
always O
happens O
, O
many O
of O
them O
have O
claimed O
to O
have O
been O
in O
care O
for O
over O
twenty O
years O
without O
having O
managed O
to O
achieve O
any O
improvement O
. O

Everyone O
agreed O
that O
they O
had O
again O
found O
the O
desire O
to O
fight O
and O
to O
feel O
real O
people O
thanks O
to O
the O
assistance O
of O
self O
- O
help O
groups O
. O

" O
They O
have O
succeeded O
- O
said O
Alexander B-PER
- O
to O
give O
meaning O
to O
my O
time O
, O
to O
animate O
my O
days O
, O
to O
give O
order O
to O
my O
life O
, O
to O
give O
a O
reason O
to O
my O
acts O
, O
to O
rediscover O
the O
affection O
and O
love O
that O
I O
had O
denied O
. O
" O

Great O
interest O
also O
among O
the O
operators O
, O
among O
them O
Antonella B-PER

" O
Patients O
with O
severe O
personality O
disorders O
and O
schizophrenia O
- O
he O
said O
- O
are O
increasingly O
increasing O
, O
perhaps O
because O
our O
societies O
are O
increasingly O
individualistic O
and O
there O
is O
never O
time O
to O
listen O
to O
anyone O
. O
" O

Unfortunately O
, O
only O
33 O
% O
of O
cases O
can O
be O
healed O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
working O
with O
these O
types O
of O
patients O
it O
is O
important O
to O
listen O
and O
try O
to O
identify O
with O
them O
, O
with O
their O
problems O
. O

Today O
the O
chapter O
on O
culture O
and O
the O
practice O
of O
sharing O
will O
be O
considered O
and O
there O
will O
be O

how O
are O
these O

First O
of O
all O
they O
have O
no O
human O

they O
remember O

anything O
industrial O

their O

not O

in O

they O
seem O
forced O

all O
the O

- O
said O
the O
expert O

he O
was O
a O
man O

it O
carried O
an O
object O
reserved O
for O
the O
highest O
class O
, O
a O
copper O
axe O
. O

In O
his O
hands O
he O
held O
a O
dagger O
, O
and O
his O
body O
showed O
obvious O
signs O
of O
struggle O

The O
most O
recent O
hypotheses O
speak O
of O
a O
shepherd O
, O
murdered O
for O
his O
flocks O
. O

But O
if O
it O
were O
so O
- O
he O
explained O
Tecchiati B-PER
- O
why O
did O
n't O
they O
steal O
the O
axe O

an O
object O
from O

value O
at O

Another O
hypothesis O
speaks O
of O
a O
shaman O
, O
a O
man O
of O
religion O
who O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
himself O
for O
his O
people O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
explained O
, O
even O
in O
this O
case O
, O
the O
armament O
he O
was O
endowed O
with O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
and O
the O
blow O
behind O
him O
. O

According O
to O
Tecchiati B-PER
, O
he O
was O
definitely O
a O
high O
- O
ranking O
man O
, O
a O
survivor O
, O
since O
at O
a O
time O
when O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
reach O
the O
age O
of O
thirty O
, O
Oetzi B-PER
died O
murdered O
at O
an O
age O
of O
over O
40 O
. O

The O
poor O
weariness O
of O
the O
bones O
of O
the O
joints O
denotes O
a O
life O
without O
physical O
stress O
, O
therefore O
excludes O
the O
pastor O
's O
hypothesis O
. O

The O
mystery O
of O
Ötzi B-PER
continues O
to O
fascinate O
the O
researchers O
, O
and O
is O
destined O
to O
keep O

3 O
out O

the O
twins O
can O
be O
used O
for O
a O
stem O
cell O
transplant O
. O

They O
were O
born O
in O
April O
, O
at O
the O
Obstetric O
Clinic O
of O
St. O
Matthew O
and O
at O
the O
time O
of O
birth O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
two O
umbilical O
cords O
is O
frozen O
and O
put O
aside O
. O

But O
at O
a O
first O
examination O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
one O
of O
the O
two O
is O
rich O
in O
stem O
cells O
, O
the O
other O
is O
poor O
. O

For O
Locatelli B-PER
, O
this O
is O
the O
right O
opportunity O
not O
to O
limit O
itself O
to O
a O
transplant O
with O
the O
stem O
- O
rich O
unit O
, O
but O
to O
use O
the O
other O
, O
which O
is O
equally O
compatible O
, O
after O
the O
amplification O
of O
the O
number O
of O
stem O
cells O
. O

In O
this O
way O
- O
it O
has O
specified O
the O
doctor O
Pavese O
- O
it O
has O
been O
possible O
to O
verify O
, O
through O
appropriate O
molecular O
investigations O
, O
the O
contribution O
of O
both O
the O
placental O
supply O
chains O
, O
those O
of O
the O
unit O
rich O
of O
stem O
cells O
but O
also O
that O
of O
the O
poorer O
unit O
, O
whose O
stem O
cells O
have O
grown O
of O
number O
in O
vitro O
. O

And O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
in O
vitro O
expanded O
units O
can O
also O
contribute O
to O
stem O
attachment O
, O
then O
diversify O
to O
form O
healthy O
red O
blood O
cells O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
double O
transplant O
, O
which O
took O
place O
on O
August O
12 O
, O
after O
the O
number O
of O
stem O
cells O
of O
the O
poorest O
cord O
in O
15 O
days O
had O
been O
increased O
60 O
times O
at O
the O

the O

( O
high O
in O

) O
and O
two O

later O
were O
documented O
the O
first O
signs O
of O
a O
significant O
production O

healthy O

The O

, O
what O
share O
of O
work O
to O

on O

what O
to O
leave O
, O
when O
to O
go O
on O
vacation O
and O
what O
refresher O
courses O
to O
follow O
. O

I O
would O
like O
nothing O
to O
be O
decided O
without O
consulting O
me O
first O
and O
I O
would O
like O
the O
job O
just O
a O
few O
minutes O
from O
my O
house O
. O

The O
above O
obviously O
serves O
only O
as O
a O
benevolent O
provocation O
to O
get O
to O
the O
core O
of O
the O
above O
question O
about O
the O
Company B-ORG
's O
Directorate I-ORG
General I-ORG
. O

Can O
anyone O
really O
believe O
that O
everything O
mentioned O
above O
is O
feasible O
or O
not O
depending O
on O
the O
characteristics O
and O
prospects O
of O
the O
Director O
General O
? O

It O
is O
obvious O
, O
abandoning O
the O
facecies O
, O
that O
the O
Director O
General O
of O
Provincial O
Health O
can O
influence O
many O
of O
these O
aspects O
, O
both O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
user O
citizen O
and O
for O
the O
citizen O
dependent O
on O
the O
Health O
Services O
, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
bring O
to O
the O
discussion O
the O
conviction O
that O
those O
who O
direct O
the O
Health B-ORG
Company I-ORG
must O
comply O
with O
the O
directives O
of O
those O
who O
, O
by O
their O
own O
institutional O
mandate O
, O
must O
take O
charge O
of O
the O
Health B-ORG
Service I-ORG
as O
a O
whole O
, O
that O
is O
, O
of O
the O
Policy O
. O

The O
Politico O
must O
tell O
the O
Director O
General O
what O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
and O
must O
put O
in O
place O
checks O
that O
allow O
him O
to O
have O
information O
of O
return O
in O
order O
to O
correct O
eventual O
digressions O
from O
the O
program O
. O

The O
operational O
part O
of O
the O
Directorate O
must O
be O
guided O
by O
the O
political O
side O
which O
has O
the O
delicate O
task O
of O
making O
compatible O
the O
various O
requests O
, O
sometimes O
conflicting O
, O
of O
citizens O
towards O
public O
health O
. O

The O
Politico O
must O
listen O
to O
everyone O
but O
it O
is O
then O
fatal O
that O
it O
must O
take O
decisions O
, O
which O
can O
not O
please O
everyone O
. O

The O
mandate O
must O
be O
clear O
and O
equally O
explicit O
in O
the O
instruments O
for O
measuring O
results O
. O

It O
is O
not O
conceivable O
that O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Director O
- O
General O
should O
be O
evaluated O
only O
in O
the O
vicinity O
of O
the O
end O
of O
the O
term O
of O
office O
; O

Politics O
should O
have O
a O
constant O
return O
of O
what O
happens O
in O
the O
Health B-ORG
Company I-ORG
both O
by O
those O
who O
produce O
the O
Services O
and O
by O
those O
who O
benefit O
from O
it O
. O

As O
for O
the O
collaborators O
of O
the O
Director O
General O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
reject O
a O
priori O
positions O
of O
those O
who O
believe O
that O
only O
outside O
Trentino B-LOC
you O
can O
find O
Managers O
of O
a O
certain O
professional O
thickness O
; O

in O
the O
same O
way O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
the O
promotion O
of O
the O
" O
trentinity O
" O
as O
such O
as O
a O
judgment O
of O
merit O
should O
be O
rejected O
. O

Once O
again O
it O
is O
the O
political O
and O
legislative O
framework O
that O
makes O
the O
Director O
General O
surround O
himself O
with O
trusted O
collaborators O
and O
it O
is O
therefore O
necessary O
that O
the O
choice O
takes O
place O
according O
to O
certain O
criteria O
. O

The O
policy O
must O
therefore O
give O
precise O
directives O
and O
monitor O
their O
application O
, O
looking O
for O
the O
correction O
to O
those O
dysfunctions O
that O
ten O
years O
of O
the O
Company O
of O
Health O
may O
have O
highlighted O
. O

This O
process O
is O
still O
unfinished O
, O
with O
both O
general O
and O
local O
aspects O
( O
the O
role O
of O

General I-ORG
only O
to O

a O
few O
) O
still O
awaiting O
a O
solution O
. O

To O
think O
that O
the O
dismissal O
of O
the O
current O
Director O
General O
represents O
the O
magical O
solution O
to O
health O
problems O
is O
an O
illusion O
. O

In O
order O
to O
govern O
an O
imposing O
machine O
like O
the O
Trentine O
Health O
there O
is O
also O
need O
to O
know O
the O

aspects O
and O
the O
revolution O
continues O
at O
the O

does O
not O
go O
in O
this O
direction O

The O

The O
most O

had O
been O
rejected O
by O
the O

of O
the O

as O
it O
is O
too O
suffering O

Even O
the O
second O
crucified O
Christ O
had O
been O
snubbed O
by O
ecclesiastical O
power O
. O

Then O
he O
, O
an O

of O
absolute O
level O
, O
a O
true O
rebel O
, O
a O
creative O
, O
one O
that O

has O
collaborated O
for O
twenty O
years O
with O
the O
Accademia B-ORG
di I-ORG
Brera I-ORG
, O
Milan B-LOC
. O

First O
as O
a O
student O
and O
then O
as O
a O
teacher O
. O

I O
came O
from O
Via O
Grazioli O
, O
in O
Trento B-LOC
, O
a O
beautiful O
old O
house O
, O
even O
when O
Via O
Grazioli O
was O
flanked O
by O
the O
trees O
and O
the O
road O
was O
sprinkled O
with O
jay O
. O

On O
the O
ceiling O
of O
the O
carved O

, O
on O
the O
square O
walls O
and O
sculptures O
. O

A O
language O
of O
his O
, O
readable O
, O
as O
of O
a O
true O
artist O
who O
leaves O
the O
mark O
. O

When O
did O
he O
prepare O
the O
rejected O
Christ O
? O

In O
2001 O
I O
was O
asked O
for O
a O
crucified O
Christ O
, O
for O
the O
new O
church O
of O
Villazzano B-LOC
. O

I O
realized O
it O
in O
polychrome O
iron O
, O
one O
meter O
and O
sixty O
centimeters O
by O
one O
meter O
and O
fifty O
meters O
. O

But O
the O
liturgical B-ORG
commission I-ORG
of O
the O
curia B-ORG
gave O
negative O
opinion O
. O
A O
Christ O
is O
too O
painful O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Think O
of O
what O
it O
would O
have O
meant O
, O
instead O
, O
" O
little O
painful O
" O
. O

But O
no O
, O
it O
was O
too O
painful O
. O

Some O
expressions O
- O
the O
artist O
now O
defines O
them O
- O
medieval O
, O
which O
struck O
me O
. O

The O
architect O
Pisoni B-PER
, O
who O
had O
commissioned O
the O
work O
, O
liked O
it O
and O
asked O
me O
to O
make O
another O
, O
a O
second O
version O
. O

After O
a O
few O
months O
, O
Mauro B-PER
De I-PER
Carli I-PER
presented O
the O
new O
work O
. O

It O
was O
accepted O
this O
time O
. O

But O
I O
was O
asked O
for O
some O
variations O
. O

An O
artist O
was O
asked O
for O
variations O
. O

He O
answered O
: O

A O
sacrosanct O
right O
. O

But O
it O
does O
n't O
respect O
my O
autonomy O
of O
expression O
. O

If O
they O
want O
a O
bad O
crucifixion O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
do O
it O
to O
them O

Carlo B-PER

, O
a O
straight O
back O
artist O
. O

The O
church O
of O
Villazzano B-LOC
was O
inaugurated O
and O
inside O
appeared O
a O
very O
old O
crucifix O
. O
Such O
as O
not O
to O
leave O
a O
bare O
wall O
. O

Now O
, O
the O
first O
crucified O
Christ O
of O
the O
series O
, O
perhaps O
the O
most O
beautiful O
( O
very O
, O
very O
beautiful O
in O
absolute O
) O
next O
Tuesday O
12 O
, O
at O
11 O
o'clock O
, O
will O
be O
presented O
to O
the O
press O
and O
citizenship O
by O
the O
artist O
, O
in O
his O
study O
that O
is O
near O
the O
Sanctuary O
of O
the O
Lastes O
. O

After O
that O
- O
says O
De B-PER
Carli I-PER
- O
everyone O
was O
convinced O
that O
the O
crucifix O
had O
been O
sold O
. O

But O
it O
was O
n't O
like O
that O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
however O
, O
I O
had O
transformed O
it O
into O
a O
crucifixion O
: O

a O
house O
around O
, O
an O
altar O
. O

An O
idea O
that O
had O
been O
aborted O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
the O
client O
had O
gone O
on O
its O
own O
. O

Christ O
, O
we O
saw O
him O
, O
remained O
the O
same O
. O

However O
, O
he O
was O
found O
a O
home O
and O
a O
family O
. O

At O
his O
feet O
there O
are O
two O
pious O
women O
, O
it O
became O
a O
scene O
. O

What O
happens O
to O
him O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
just O
want O
the O
people O
who O
followed O
the O
story O
of O
this O
work O
to O
judge O
its O
evolution O
. O

Let O
's O
call O
it O
taste O
, O
or O
censorship O
. O

This O
crucifix O
- O
says O
the O
artist O
- O
has O
somehow O
marked O
some O
consciences O
. O

They O
never O
said O
it O
was O
a O
bad O
work O
. O

It O
was O
just O
too O
painful O
. O

Like O
they O
're O
telling O
a O
cyclist O
that O
he O
's O
pedaling O
too O
fast O
! O

No O
! O

I O
saw O
him O
there O
in O
the O
study O
... O
poor O
Christ O
... O
and O
I O
built O
a O
context O
around O
him O
. O

Tuesday O
morning O
all O
the O
Trentinos O
who O
want O
to O
see O
him O
will O
be O
able O
to O
see O
him O
, O
in O
the O
studio O
of O
the O
artist O
. O

A O
blue O
background O
with O
stars O

A O
great O
work O

Mauro B-PER

Carli I-PER
, O
to O
survive O
in O

in O
Brera B-ORG
, O
then O
at O
the O
Institute B-ORG

in O
Trento B-LOC

And O
today O
he O
thinks O
he O
's O
leaving O
. O

Towards O
the O
sun B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
far O
from O
this O
city O
and O
its O
censorous O
drives O
. O

For O
the O
material O
, O
the O
disbursement O
may O
exceed O
EUR O
80 O

everyone O
wants O
fashionable O

The O
doubt O
, O
at O
this O
point O
, O
is O
lawful O
. O

In O
the O
eternal O
struggle O
for O
the O
purchase O
of O
school O
supplies O
that O
bleeds O
a O
family O
's O
wallet O
, O
is O
it O
not O
that O
parents O
also O
have O
their O
responsibilities O
? O

The O
hypothesis O
arises O
after O
a O
day O
spent O
in O
Trento B-LOC
's O
stationery O
to O
smell O
the O
trends O
for O
this O
school O
year O
2004 O
/ O
2005 O
. O

And O
on O
the O
catwalk O
as O
at O
school O
, O
no O
one O
escapes O
the O
temptation O
to O
be O
trendy O
. O

We O
meet O
a O
family O
like O
: O

Dad O
, O
Mom O
and O
a O
beautiful O
girl O
who O
will O
start O
elementary O
school O
on O
Monday O
. O

Tension O
for O
the O
new O

, O
the O
first O

of O
his O
life O
, O
seems O
not O
to O
be O
there O
. O

Wander O
his O
tastes O
vaguely O
( O
better O
Winnie O
The O
Pooh O
, O
compared O
to O
a O
serious O
square O
backpack O
of O
the O
Scout B-ORG
that O
also O
costs O
97 O
euros O
) O
, O
here O
is O
the O
activation O
of O
the O
mother O
. O

The O
backpack O
with O
the O
bear O
most O
loved O
by O
children O
( O
49.50 O
euros O
) O
is O
blue O
, O
so O
a O
coordinated O
set O
is O
needed O
: O

diary O
( O
€ O
9.50 O
) O
and O
case O
with O
myriad O
pockets O
and O
zippers O
. O

There O
are O
three O
measures O
. O

The O
largest O
( O
EUR O
23.90 O
) O
is O
chosen O
. O

There O
would O
also O
be O
to O
buy O
a O
separate O
sachet O
, O
but O
missing O
the O
one O
of O
the O
same O
shade O
. O

So O
nothing O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
child O
runs O
around O
the O
shop O
, O
more O
interested O
in O
toys O
than O
in O
the O
merchandise O
that O
she O
will O
have O
to O
take O
to O
school O
. O

In O
short O
, O
in O
all O
82 O
euros O
and O
90 O
cents O
. O

Without O
notebooks O
, O
drawing O
albums O
, O
the O
inevitable O
lining O
? O

The O
saleswoman O
winks O
and O
says O
: O

If O
you O
come O
first O
next O
year O
, O
you O
will O
have O
more O
choice O
. O

Very O
practical O
father O
: O

Maybe O
we O
'll O
see O
each O
other O
in O
three O
years O
. O

STANDARDY O
, O
TO O
ALL O
COSTS O
. O

One O
may O
complain O
that O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
prices O
are O
exorbitant O
. O

Understandably O
, O
a O
little O
bitterness O
in O
unraveling O
the O
wallet O
. O

But O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
always O
prevails O
the O
desire O
to O
buy O
the O
novelty O
. O

Both O
from O
the O
moms O
, O
when O
the O
little O
children O
are O
small O
, O
and O
from O
the O
older O
girls O
who O
make O
purchases O
alone O
. O

For O
boys O
the O
speech O
is O
a O
little O
different O
, O
since O
they O
are O
often O
led O
to O
delegate O
. O

The O
proof O
of O
the O
fashion O
tension O
is O
given O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
proposals O
of O
the O
years O
ago O
are O
sadly O
piled O
up O
in O
a O
corner O
, O
under O
the O
word O
" O
offer O
" O
. O

Even O
with O
highly O
competitive O
prices O
, O
the O
backpacks O
of O
the O
old O
cartoon O
characters O
are O
no O
longer O
of O
interest O
. O

And O
so O
the O
Simpsons O
, O
Sabrina O
, O
Arale O
, O
are O
sold O
at O
prices O
ranging O
from O
29 O
to O
39 O
euros O
. O

We O
have O
been O
carrying O
boxes O
- O
confirmation O
of O
a O
contract O
- O
for O
at O
least O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

They O
were O
never O
looked O
at O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
fashion O
. O

This O
year O
's O

The O
investigation O
began O
in O
the O
spring O

this O
year O
when O
a O
lady O

about O
40 O
years O

by O
two O

who O
once O
pocketed O
the O

had O
become O

Singular O
the O
way O
Mario B-PER

had O
managed O
to O
have O
contact O

Being O
one O
day O
behind O
the O
wheel O
of O
her O
car O
and O
traveling O
at O

the O
lady O
saw O
herself O
overcome O

then O
stood O

at O
even O

At O
that O
point O
the O

performed O
the O

the O

only O
a O

also O
gave O

The O

of O
the O
piece O
, O
" O

is O
directed O
by O
a O
song O
that O
closes O
the O

while O
the O

of O
the O

a O
continuous O

but O
in O
whose O
interior O
there O

like O

But O
for O
the O

, O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
narrative O

The O

holds O
a O

that O
embraces O

which O
surprises O
the O

its O
theatricality O

In O

that O

meant O
to O
safeguard O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
the O
Supreme B-ORG

tells O

it O
is O
enough O

use O

there O
is O

invent O

In O
the O
wake O
of O
these O
principles O
the O
Cassation B-ORG
rejected O
the O

then O

Paolo B-PER
Cunego I-PER
of O
the O
Consumer B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
is O
angry O
with O
the O
authorities O
that O
have O
decided O
to O
review O
the O
level O
of O
tariffs O
, O
but O
also O
with O
the O
union O
. O

In O
June O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
increase O
certain O
tariffs O
, O
which O
have O
been O
stopped O
for O
some O
time O
. O

But O
we O
were O
told O
that O
the O
bus O
ticket O
would O
substantially O
increase O
in O
Trento B-LOC
. O

Instead O
, O
there O
are O
also O
increased O
transport O
subscriptions O
and O
the O
same O
ticket O
as O
the O
train O
. O

Increases O
in O
transport O
by O
10 O
% O
12 O
% O
. O

In O
the O
past O
few O
days O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
the O
Adoc B-ORG
referring O
to O
the O
Uil B-ORG
, O
let O
us O
know O
that O
the O
costs O
of O
school O
material O
are O
rising O
. O

But O
that O
union O
, O
along O
with O
the O
others O
, O
had O
meanwhile O
accepted O
the O
increase O
in O
tariffs O
. O

Excuse O
me O
, O
Cunego B-PER
, O
but O
the O
tariff O
level O
was O
still O
in O
2000 O
. O

" O
True O
, O
but O
inflation O
in O
the O
meantime O
has O
certainly O
not O
been O
the O
one O
set O
by O
the O
various O
governments O
and O
wages O
have O
come O
out O
very O
hard O
. O

And O
there O
is O
something O
else O
: O

Meanwhile O
, O
many O
public O
or O
para O
- O
public O
services O
have O
deteriorated O
. O

Think O
of O
the O
railways O
. O

On O
certain O
routes O
, O
or O
even O
at O
certain O
times O
of O
the O
year O
, O
there O
is O
no O
place O
either O
sitting O
or O
standing O
. O

Let O
's O
think O
of O
the O
convoy O
that O
arrives O
in O
Trento B-LOC
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
Christmas O
Market O
. O

At O
this O
point O
I O
say O
that O
the O
service O
is O
no O
longer O
suitable O
for O
the O
tariff O
. O

The O
union O
then O
, O
if O
it O
accepts O
the O
increase O
in O
tariffs O
, O
must O
demand O
the O
improvement O
of O
the O
service O
. O

Paolo B-PER
Cunego I-PER
also O
notes O
that O
in O
this O
way O
the O
use O
of O
the O
public O
medium O
is O
discouraged O
, O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
that O
of O
the O
private O
medium O
. O

But O
the O
train O
is O
a O
national O
fact O
, O
let O
's O
observe O
. O

Also O
the O
Valsugana O
railway O
is O
not O
offering O
a O
valuable O
service O

a O
proposal O

The O

complaint O

made O
by O

He O
claims O
that O
the O
deer O
was O
his O
, O
that O
he O
raised O
him O
in O
his O
lands O
and O
that O
therefore O
he O
should O
not O
be O
put O
down O

But O
we O
've O
been O
informed O

that O
beast O
had O
fled O

and O
it O
's O
been O
wandering O
through O

Clear O

In O

it O
has O
been O

And O
how O
could O

a O

the O
natural O
cycle O
, O
it O
becomes O
part O
of O
the O
public O
wildlife O
heritage O
. O

So O
, O
in O
our O
case O
, O
he O
was O
huntable O
. O

What O
did O
they O
tell O
you O
to O
do O
to O
the O
Federation B-ORG
? O

They O
calmed O
me O
, O
they O
begged O
me O
not O
to O
move O
. O

That O
things O
will O
become O
clear O
soon O
and O
we O
must O
not O
fear O
anything O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
unlucky O
deer O
has O
already O
been O
ripped O
apart O
and O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
hunter O
's O
freezer O
that O
knocked O
him O
down O
. O

" O
Surely O
- O
adds O
Ioriatti B-PER
- O
our O
partner O
will O
not O
return O
this O
is O
legitimately O
his O
. O
" O

From O
the O
information O
we O
took O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
animal O
had O
fled O
already O
around O
May O
or O
June O
from O
the O
place O
where O
it O
lived O
in O
captivity O
. O

So O
just O
listen O
to O
the O
other O
bell O
too O
. O

And O
that O
is O
Marino B-PER
Paoli I-PER
who O
on O
the O
territory O
of O
Civezzano B-LOC
is O
a O
porphyry O
quarry O
. O

That O
beast O
was O
mine O
and O
it O
was O
recognizable O
. O
- O
answers O
the O
phone O
- O
The O
deer O
had O
fled O
on O
May O
6 O
. O

And O
I O
immediately O
reported O
it O
to O
Pergine B-LOC
Forest O
. O

I O
had O
two O
deer O
, O
a O
male O
and O
a O
female O
. O

And O
what O
did O
he O
do O
with O
it O
? O

Raising O
deer O
is O
certainly O
not O
a O
very O
common O
activity O
. O

" O
I O
had O
bought O
them O
at O
the O
Centre O
of O
Casteller O
, O
Federcaccia B-ORG
recovers O
the O
injured O
animals O
or O
rears O
the O
abandoned O
little O
ones O
. O
" O

However O
, O
after O
the O
escape O
the O
Forest B-ORG
had O
made O
a O
survey O
at O
my O
house O
. O

So O
, O
having O
denounced O
it O
, O
it O
certainly O
can O
not O
be O
said O
that O
no O
one O
knew O
anything O
about O
the O
escape O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
beast O
had O
in O
his O
ear O
, O
clearly O
visible O
, O
the O
yellow O
earring O
. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
reported O
it O
to O
the O
Hunters B-ORG
' I-ORG
Association I-ORG
. O

And O
now O
I O
'm O
also O
going O
to O
the O
lawyer O
to O
protect O
my O
rights O
. O

But O
according O
to O
you O
... O
" O
Listen O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
mad O
at O
the O
hunter O
who O
shot O
. O
" O

But O
the O
deer O
was O
mine O
and O
I O
want O
another O
one O
back O
. O

That O
's O
all O
it O
is O
. O

What O
about O
the O
deer O
? O

A O
life O
is O
lame O
. O

First O
orphaned O
at O
Casteller O
, O
then O
in O

. O

To O
finish O
with O
a O
ball O
in O

chest O
after O
a O
few O
days O

Now O

pending O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
river O

in O
the O

connected O
to O
the O

( O
as O
foreseen O
by O
a O
resolution O
of O
the O
City B-ORG
Council I-ORG
of O
2001 O
) O
to O
establish O
a O
green O
belt O

along O
the O
right O
bank O
of O
the O

, O
in O
order O
to O
prevent O
any O

An O
opposite O
proposal O
- O
writes O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Committee B-ORG
Pro I-ORG
Vela I-ORG
, O
Fabiano B-PER
Condini I-PER
- O
compared O
to O

that O
of O
the O
council O
member O
who O
intended O
to O
carry O
out O
in O
the O
area O
a O
mega O
- O
pole O
of O
the O
destruction O
of O

However O
, O
these O
questions O
have O
not O
been O
dealt O
with O
in O
the O
Committee O
on O
Town O
and O
Country O
Planning O
. O

What O
happened O
to O
them O
? O

Condini B-PER
wonders O
. O

In O
the O
light O
of O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
Councillor O
Andreatta B-PER
to O
take O
into O
account O
the O
requests O
submitted O
by O
30 O
June O
of O
this O
year O
at O
the O
Sailing B-LOC
, O
they O
also O
demand O
that O
their O
requests O
be O
debated O
in O
committee O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
this O
round O
of O
revision O
of O
the O
Prg O
we O
will O
not O
talk O
about O
the O
fates O
of O
the O
demolition O
pole O
, O
so O
the O
Sailing B-LOC
, O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
does O
not O
run O
risks O
. O

Residents O
, O
however O
, O
return O
to O
office O
to O
protect O
themselves O
for O
the O
future O
, O
in O
the O
event O
that O
some O
subsequent O
urban O
changes O
( O
maybe O
within O
a O
public O
works O
review O
) O
were O
decided O
to O
change O
the O
destination O
of O
those O
land O
. O

In O
recent O
days O
Condini B-PER
has O
therefore O
also O
written O
to O
the O
president O
Agostino B-PER
Bitteleri I-PER
so O
that O
the O
Vela B-LOC
case O
finds O
adequate O
discussion O
within O
the O
urban B-ORG
commission I-ORG
. O

On O
behalf O
of O
the O
Committee O
- O
he O
insists O
- O
I O
would O
ask O
that O
our O
questions O
be O
examined O
at O
least O
, O
and O
I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
see O
a O
favourable O
outcome O
. O

Condini B-PER
says O
he O
has O
already O
cashed O
the O
support O
of O
Pompermaier B-PER
and O
Shoes O
, O
members O
of O
the O
commission B-ORG
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
up O
to O
the O
administration O
to O
resume O
the O
game O
in O
response O
to O
the O
requests O
of O
the O
community O
. O

We O
consider O
it O
appropriate O
- O
write O
the O
applicants O
in O
the O
request O
for O
variant O
to O
the O
Prg O
sent O
to O
Mayor O
Pacher B-PER
- O
that O
the O
whole O
green O
area O
located O
north O
of O
Vela B-LOC
( O
Laghetti B-LOC
) O
, O
for O
its O
high O
and O
original O
landscape O
and O
environmental O
value O
, O
should O
be O
transformed O
into O
a O
park O
, O
a O
pole O
of O
nature O
, O
for O
the O
whole O
city O
. O

As O
an O
alternative O
, O
they O
propose O
the O
maintenance O
of O
the O
current O
primary O
agricultural O
green O
destination O
( O
as O
provided O
for O
by O
the O
Pup O
) O
and O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
band O
of O
respect O
of O
at O
least O
150 O
meters O
from O
the O
neighbouring O
biotopes O
, O
from O
the O
ponds O
of O
Velaverde O
and O
Sorasass B-LOC
, O
and O
as O
many O
from O
the O
river O
Adige B-LOC
. O

" O
Within O
this O
area O
of O
respect O
- O
here O
is O
the O
most O
important O
step O
- O
no O
productive O
activity O
incompatible O
with O
neighbouring O
biotopes O
and O
no O
construction O
or O
infrastructure O
not O
directly O
connected O
with O
biotopes O
and O
agriculture O
will O
have O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
. O

" O
We O
think O
- O
they O
conclude O
- O
that O
the O
protection O
of O
this O
area O
is O
of O
great O
interest O
to O
all O
the O
present O
inhabitants O
of O
Trentino B-LOC

for O

generations O

In O

a O
strong O

an O

Fischer B-PER
, O
for O
his O

, O
expressed O
an O
equally O
strong O
defence O

recalled O
that O
it O

the O

They O
could O
have O

with O
the O

the O

by O

It O
all O
began O
in O
mid O

with O
the O
request O
of O
Dersut B-ORG

a O
well O
- O
known O
company O

Open O
up O
! O

The O
area O
offers O
a O
wide O
choice O
of O
bars O
, O
as O
many O
as O
nine O
within O
50 O
meters O
, O
and O
the O
owners O
had O
turned O
against O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
feared O
competitor O
. O

They O
had O
argued O
above O
all O
about O
a O
law O
that O
allows O
a O
thickening O
of O
supply O
such O
, O
to O
them O
say O
, O
to O
put O
companies O
in O
crisis O
. O

Because O
if O
for O
classical O
bar O
licenses O
( O
B2 B-ORG
) O
there O
are O
minimum O
limits O
and O
distances O
to O
be O

, O
white O

( O

are O
exception O
and O
can O
also O
arise O
in O
the O
next O
room O

" O
Norma O
to O
be O
changed O
" O
hastened O
to O
say O
Confesercenti B-ORG
and O
Union B-ORG
and I-ORG
Trade I-ORG
. O

But O
for O
now O
the O
license O
is O
a O
right O
. O

On O
the O
news O
of O
the O
bad O
moods O
in O
Via B-LOC
Pozzo I-LOC
had O
then O
triggered O
a O
bang O
and O
response O
with O
the O
consumer B-ORG
defense I-ORG
committee I-ORG
, O
which O
had O
welcomed O
the O
new O
arrival O
and O
denounced O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
cartel O
between O
bartenders O
to O
keep O
the O
prices O
high O
. O

Anyway O
after O
the O
controversy O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
premises O
, O
who O
had O
already O
promised O
Dersut B-ORG
the O
sale O
to O
rent O
, O
had O
pulled O
back O
, O
evidently O
frightened O
by O
the O
dust O
or O
convinced O
by O
the O
pressures O
of O
the O
neighbors O
. O

And O
instead O
of O
the O
new O
bar O
has O
recently O
opened O
an O
employment O
agency O
, O
greeted O
with O
a O
sigh O
of O
relief O

So O
it O

all O
sorted O
out O
? O

No O
way O

Initially O
in O
truth O
the O
Dersut B-ORG
had O
thought O
to O
quit O
the O

Then O
instead O
another O

out O

happens O
to O

just O
a O
few O
steps O
from O
the O

then O
away O
with O
a O

it O

certain O
: O

via O

, O
to O

within O

will O
return O
that O

so O
dear O

without O
those O
dangerous O

that O

In O

, O
the O
engineer O
Bruno B-PER
Delaiti I-PER
( O

) O
presented O
the O
executive O
project O
of O
the O
new O
road O
, O
which O
should O
be O
completed O
, O
if O
all O
goes O
well O
, O
by O
2005 O
. O

Undoubtedly O
of O
modern O
conception O
, O
the O
new O
elaborate O
introduces O
, O
in O
the O
way O
that O
starts O
from O
Piazza O
Libertà O
, O
numerous O
innovations O
. O

The O
first O
, O
and O
perhaps O
the O
most O
important O
, O
is O
the O
narrowing O
of O
the O
roadway O
, O
which O
will O
have O
an O
average O
width O
of O
6.5 O
meters O
. O

This O
, O
in O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
municipality B-LOC
, O
should O
largely O
inhibit O
the O
use O
of O
the O
road O
by O
commuters O
who O
today O
by O
- O
thus O
pass O
the O
busy O
via O
Bolzano O
. O

The O
cloggings O
on O
via O
Bolzano O
, O
moreover O
, O
are O
destined O
to O
disappear O
in O
the O
future O
, O
since O
the O
large O
roundabout O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
Bermax B-ORG
store O
is O
on O
launch O
ramp O
. O

But O
the O
new O
Via O
S. O
Anna O
will O
also O
be O
equipped O
with O
a O
bike O
path O
, O
which O
will O
be O
built O
on O
the O
east O
side O
flanked O
by O
enlarged O
and O
renovated O
sidewalks O
. O

The O
designers O
have O
taken O
care O
of O
every O
aspect O
: O

to O
make O
room O
for O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
will O
be O
removed O
the O
current O
acacia O
trees O
, O
but O
in O
their O
place O
apparently O
will O
be O
prepared O
a O
new O
tree O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
previous O
, O
coupled O
with O
small O
hedges O
and O
floral O
species O
. O

Among O
other O
design O
choices O
, O
there O
is O
the O
creation O
of O
some O
small O
gulfs O
on O
board O
the O
road O
, O
which O
will O
also O
allow O
the O
birth O
of O
27 O
new O
parking O
spaces O
which O
, O
in O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
circuit O
, O
will O
be O
regulated O
, O
at O
least O
during O
daytime O
hours O
, O
with O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O

. O

They O
will O
also O
make O
their O

two O

since O
they O
will O
be O

In O
the O

The O

that O
American O

developed O
in O
two O
suggestive O
shows O

both O

about O

only O

the O

at O
the O

The O
presence O
of O
the O

at O
the O

is O
an O
interesting O
contamination O

In O

Giorello O
cultivates O
a O

In O

Claudio B-PER
Gentile I-PER
breathes O
a O
sigh O
of O
relief O
after O
working O
psychologically O
with O
his O

convincing O
them O

think O
about O

not O
the O
eventuality O
of O

" O
To O
the O
boys O
I O
told O
them O
to O
prepare O
mentally O
for O
the O
race O
, O
" O
explains O
Gentile B-PER
, O
" O
because O
the O
game O
will O
definitely O
be O
there O

" O

I O
told O
them O
to O
focus O
, O
because O
the O
risk O
of O
not O
playing O
does O
not O
exist O
. O

The O
weather O
forecast O
comforts O
us O
. O

If O
it O
starts O
raining O
during O
the O
race O
, O
then O
it O
will O
become O
a O
problem O
for O
the O
other O
national O
" O
. O

The O
case O
of O
the O
game O
ground O
was O
born O
after O
the O
decision O
of O
Moldovan O

and O
Fifa B-ORG
to O
move O
the O

of O

A I-ORG
from O

to O
Chisinau B-LOC
, O
for O
reasons O
of O
internal O

( O
in O
the O
Tiraspol B-LOC
region O
there O
are O
strong O
regurgitations O
of O
independence O
and O
after O
what O
happened O
in O
Ossetia B-LOC
was O
chosen O
the O
caution O
) O
. O

In O
Chisinau B-LOC
there O
is O
only O
one O
stadium O
that O
can O
host O
international O
competitions O
. O

Hence O
the O
need O
for O
double O
commitment O
to O
the O
ground O
with O
the O
Figc B-ORG

suggestion O
to O
cut O

With O
weather O
reassurance O
, O
Gentile B-PER
thinks O
of O
the O
challenge O
with O
the O
young O
Moldovans O
, O
training O

does O
n't O
know O
( O
he O
will O
see O
a O

with O
the O

Slovenia B-ORG
- O
Moldova B-ORG
to O
discover O
them O
) O
, O
but O
that O
he O
deserves O
respect O
, O
because O
if O
he O
has O
lost O
only O
1 O
- O
0 O
in O
the O
home O
of O
Slovenia B-ORG
it O
means O
that O
he O
is O
a O

that O
has O

Gentile B-PER
leaves O

over O
to O
the O

whole O
team O
, O
with O
the O
insertion O
of O
Pepe B-PER
in O
place O
of O
the O
disqualified O

I O
do O
n't O
change O
, O
because O
the O
team O
needs O
to O
get O
to O
know O
each O
other O
even O
if O
it O
has O
n't O
shown O

Andrea B-PER
Pugliese I-PER
, O
head O
of O
Legambiente B-ORG
Trentino O
, O
rejects O
the O
provincial O
action O
plan O
set O
up O
by O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

Professor O
Pugliese B-PER
, O
what O
does O
n't O
convince O
you O
of O
the O
proposals O
made O
by O
Councillor O
Gilmozzi B-PER
? O

These O
are O
useful O
measures O
, O
such O
as O
those O
put O
in O
place O
last O
year O
, O
but O
they O
are O
insufficient O
. O

The O
effects O
have O
not O
been O
seen O
. O

It O
is O
not O
enough O
, O
in O
short O
, O
to O
block O
some O
diesel O
to O
hope O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
of O
thin O
dusts O
. O

Your O
opinion O
: O

Is O
it O
better O
to O
set O
up O
an O
alternate O
blockage O
system O
? O

I O
think O
I O
can O
say O
that O
this O
solution O
had O
brought O
greater O
benefits O
. O

At O
least O
he O
offered O
a O
stronger O
message O
to O
the O
citizens O
because O
everyone O
was O
somehow O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

Today O
it O
's O
different O
: O

the O
measure O
affects O
only O
a O
few O
vehicles O
and O
95 O
% O
of O
the O
Trentino O
people O
lose O
interest O
in O
following O
the O
story O
. O

How O
do O
you O
view O
the O
Trentino O
relationship O
with O
the O
problem O
of O
air O
pollution O
? O

Do O
they O
know O
what O
they O
're O
doing O
? O

Are O
they O
sensitive O
? O

I O
'd O
say O
so O
. O

The O
problem O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
is O
the O
difficulty O
of O
moving O
from O
theory O
to O
practice O
when O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
measures O
concern O
them O
in O
the O
first O
person O
. O

To O
give O
an O
example O
, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
petrol O
consumption O
has O
fallen O
despite O
the O
continuing O
talk O
of O
traffic O
as O
the O
main O
cause O
of O
the O
fine O
dusts O
. O

If O
you O
were O
a O
consultant O
to O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
what O
direction O
would O
you O
give O
the O
city O
councilman O
? O

One O
thing O
is O
the O
emergency O
, O
the O
other O
the O
structural O
plan O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
first O
aspect O
is O
concerned O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
little O
is O
being O
done O
. O

I O
repeat O
, O
I O
am O
in O
favour O
of O
alternate O
plates O
, O
total O
blocks O
of O
circulation O
, O
maybe O
even O
in O
scheduled O
days O
. O

What O
about O
structural O
measures O
? O

In O
words O
I O
agree O
with O
what O
the O
Province B-LOC
says O
: O

alternative O
mobility O
, O
enhancement O
of O
public O
transport O
, O
use O
of O
bikes O
. O

The O
trouble O
is O
that O
you O
talk O
a O
lot O
, O
you O
write O
, O
but O
everything O
moves O
with O
extreme O
slowness O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
blessed O
public O
transport O
service O
should O
actually O
make O
it O
appropriate O
. O

In O
Trento B-LOC
the O
situation O
is O
good O
, O
on O
the O
outskirts O
there O
is O
much O
to O
improve O
. O

Like O
what O
? O

The O
metro O
of O
Valsugana O
. O

We O
have O
been O
talking O
about O
this O
for O
years O
, O
but O
when O
can O
we O
actually O
use O
it O
? O

This O
is O
a O
criticism O
directed O
to O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

They O
produce O
many O
documents O
, O
but O
actually O
make O
great O
investments O
only O
for O
tunnels O
, O
bridges O
and O
roads O
. O

In O
short O
, O
to O
promote O
private O
traffic O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
of O
the O
proposal O
of O
the O
City O
Councillor O
Giampaolo B-PER
Berlanda I-PER
to O
allow O
access O
to O
the O
city O
only O
for O
payment O
, O
financing O
with O
revenue O
the O
free O
bus O
? O

In O
principle O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

But O
then O
there O
is O
the O
problem O
of O
translating O
it O
into O
reality O
. O

Last O
year O
Legambiente B-ORG
organized O
the O
green O
train O
to O
raise O
awareness O
on O
environmental O
issues O
with O
a O
few O

Do O
you O
have O
any O
other O

planned O

? O

The O

will O
make O
other O

will O
not O

that O
in O

But O
by O
us O
it O

less O

in O

To O
open O
the O

the O
mayor O
of O
Trento B-LOC

Alberto B-PER
Pacher I-PER
, O
who O
thanked O
the O
three O
unions O
for O
having O
represented O
, O
with O
the O
organization O
of O
this O
torchlight O
, O
the O
deep O
indignation O
of O
our O
fellow O
citizens O
and O
the O
will O
to O
reiterate O
a O
firm O
no O
to O
what O
is O
an O
insult O
to'humanity O
. O

" O
What O
happened O
in O
Beslan B-LOC
- O
said O
Pacher B-PER
- O
constitutes O
the O
overcoming O
of O
an O
unimaginable O
threshold O
, O
and O
it O
is O
important O
that O
the O
whole O
city O
, O
without O
divisions O
or O
belongings O
, O
is O
in O
the O
square O
to O
reaffirm O
values O
that O
unite O
everyone O
, O
in O
the O
name O
of O
a O
civilization O
that O
finds O
itself O
and O
of O
principles O
around O
which O
the O
idea O
of O
citizenship O
is O
built O
. O

On O
the O
need O
for O
the O
entire O
citizenship O
to O
represent O
the O
horror O
and O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
major O
tragedy O
, O
and O
to O
give O
a O
strong O
response O
to O
the O
culture O
of O
war O
and O
to O
a O
militarized O
policy O
that O
does O
not O
lead O
anywhere O
, O
Ruggero B-PER
Purin I-PER
, O
provincial O
secretary O
of O
the O
Cgil B-ORG
, O
emphasized O
instead O
: O

" O
Besides O
the O
mourning O
and O
the O
obvious O
solidarity O
for O
the O
victims O
, O
" O
said O
Purin B-PER
, O
" O
this O
event O
must O
also O
be O
an O
opportunity O
to O
relaunch O
a O
cross O
- O
cutting O
solidarity O
and O
politics O
as O
a O
means O
of O
overcoming O
conflicts O
. O
" O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
Nicola B-PER
Ferrante I-PER
, O
secretary O
of O
the O
CISL B-ORG
, O
spoke O
about O
the O
cultural O
question O
and O
the O
appeal O
to O
the O
family O
, O
according O
to O
which O
the O
children O
, O
who O
are O
our O
future O
, O
are O
being O
targeted O
here O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
the O
silence O
of O
this O
torchlight O
must O
be O
deafening O
, O
so O
that O
the O
culture O
of O
dialogue O
and O
peace O
may O
grow O
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
start O
to O
reconsider O
- O
it O
has O
concluded O
Ferrante B-PER
- O
the O
value O
of O
the O
children O
for O
the O
society O
. O

And O
therefore O
we O
invite O
all O
parents O
to O
bring O
their O
children O
to O
the O
demonstration O
, O
so O
that O
Trento B-LOC
becomes O
a O
city O
not O
only O
alpine O
, O
but O
peace O
and O
solidarity O
. O

The O
need O
to O
take O
children O
to O
the O
square O
was O
also O
underlined O
by O
Walter B-PER
Alotti I-PER
( O
Uil B-ORG

) O
to O
understand O
what O
is O
happening O
and O
to O
reassert O
the O
values O
of O
life O
and O
trust O
in O
the O
new O
generations O
. O

The O
three O
unions O
also O
invite O
all O

to O
propose O
, O
for O
the O
first O

of O

a O

Moeglin B-PER

Delcroix O
in O

I O
have O
been O
trying O

do O
it O
for O
twenty O

with O
little O
success O

Not O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
elaborate O
a O
satisfactory O
definition O

it O
is O
as O
if O
the O
result O
had O
never O
been O
acquired O
... O
at O

at O

you O
have O
to O
constantly O
start O
to O
say O
what O
the O
artist O

is O
not O
, O
rather O
than O
say O
what O
it O
is O
. O

In O
fact O
the O
problem O
comes O
from O
the O
outside O
... O
from O
the O
success O
of O
the O
expression O
, O
favored O
by O
the O
genericity O
of O

then O
from O

The O
echo O

far O
away O

so O
hidden O
appear O
the O

the O
difficult O

80 O

Last O
August O
, O
then O
, O
even O
the O
political O

was O
very O
high O

The O

The O
war O
between O
the O
two O
ethnic O
groups O
in O

caused O
thousands O

, O
and O
when O

the O

taken O
away O
from O

in O

, O
the O
ghosts O
of O

reappeared O
in O
the O
distance O
. O

Thus O
, O
although O
the O
situation O
had O
in O
the O
meantime O
calmed O
down O
, O
the O
government O
of O
Chisinau B-LOC
decided O
last O
Friday O
to O
cancel O
the O

with O
impressive O

the O

Then O
, O

The O

the O
Chechen O

the O
Arabian B-LOC

The O

can O
be O
seen O
from O

Kulayev B-PER

The O
wrath O
for O
the O

the O

Putin B-PER
: O

The O
situation O
could O
become O
explosive O

Ossetia B-LOC

Ingushetia B-LOC
were O
the O
protagonists O
of O
a O
bloody O
interethnic O
conflict O
in O
the O
1990s O
. O

Anger O
also O
begins O
to O
address O
local O
authorities O
: O

About O
300 O

protested O
in O

the O

Vladimir B-PER
Putin I-PER
lives O
perhaps O
the O
most O
difficult O
moment O
of O
his O
mandate O

Russian O

: O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
murderers O
of O
children O

but O
the O
massacre O
gave O
back O
voice O
to O
those O
who O
criticized O
him O

He O
speaks O
from O
the O
prison O

he O
serves O
a O

opposes O
the O
recipe O
of O
the O
hard O
fist O
a O
firmness O
combined O
with O
understanding O

solidarity O
, O
because O
anger O
can O
not O
overcome O

are O
feelings O
that O

Putin B-PER

who O
canceled O
a O

It O
is O
a O
case O
of O
great O
complexity O
that O
was O
discussed O
yesterday O
in O
a O

with O
abbreviated O

several O

One O
of O
the O
last O
chapters O
of O
this O
judicial O
battle O
was O
celebrated O
before O
Judge O
Marco B-PER
La I-PER
Ganga I-PER
last O
winter O
, O
when O
the O
magistrate O
sent O
the O
documents O
to O

by O
arranging O
further O
investigations O
thus O
opening O
the O
way O

trial O

There O
were O
nine O
defendants O

between O
organizers O
of O
the O
event O

It O
was O
Luciano B-PER

Italo B-PER

Paolo B-PER

All O
of O
them O
were O
acquitted O
yesterday O
, O
except O
Lorenz B-PER
even O
though O
Pm O
Carmine B-PER
Russo I-PER
had O
also O
asked O
for O
the O
condemnation O
of O
Tarasconi B-PER
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
reasons O
of O
the O
judgment O
to O
understand O
what O
reasoning O
led O
the O
judge O
to O
impose O
a O
sentence O
, O
albeit O
minimal O
. O

The O
defenders O
of O
Lorenz B-PER
, O
Roberto B-PER
Bertuol I-PER
and O
Alberto B-PER
Cunaccia I-PER
, O
had O
valid O
arguments O
to O
hope O
for O
the O
acquittal O
. O

There O
was O
in O
particular O
an O
expertise O
entrusted O
by O
the O
judge O
to O
Commander O
Calabresi B-PER
( O
a O
flight O
dean O
) O
who O
excluded O
responsibility O
from O
the O
organizers O
. O

According O
to O
the O
defense O
there O
was O
no O
causal O
link O
since O
death O
was O
to O
be O
attributed O
to O
a O
fearful O
conduct O
by O
Tiberio B-PER
Riva I-PER
himself O
. O

In O
favor O
of O
the O
defense O
also O
played O
a O
second O
circumstance O
: O

At O
any O
time O
the O
competitors O
could O
have O
stopped O
the O
race O
and O
landed O
in O
specially O
identified O
areas O
. O

Instead O
the O
judge O
considered O
that O
a O
responsibility O
, O
or O
perhaps O
co O
- O
responsibility O
, O
by O
Lorenz B-PER
, O
and O
only O
on O
his O
part O
, O
there O
was O
. O

Probably O
Ancona B-PER
believed O
that O
the O
defendant O
had O
the O
tools O
to O
understand O
that O
when O
Riva B-PER
was O
preparing O
for O
his O
flight O
, O
the O
weather O
conditions O
were O
no O
longer O
safe O
and O
therefore O
should O
have O
stopped O
departures O
. O

Instead O
Riva B-PER
, O
35 O
years O
old O
from O
Bergamo B-LOC
, O
had O
taken O
off O
from O
the O
Belvedere B-LOC
di O
Canazei B-LOC
and O
had O
to O
land O
at O
the O
end O
of O
its O
evolutions O
in O
the O

of O
Campitello B-LOC

After O

his O

it O

matter O

It O
's O
just O
because O
we O
were O
friends O
that O
we O
did O
n't O
send O
him O
to O
that O
country O
when O
, O
maybe O
without O

, O
he O
asphalted O
us O

a O

have O
pulled O
it O
in O
all O
corners O

on O
the O
right O

on O
the O

but O
he O
always O

, O
in O
the O
gazebo O
of O
his O
club O
, O
in O
Riva B-LOC
, O
talking O
about O
the O
tennis O
that O
was O
but O
also O
about O
what O
will O
be O
. O

We O
found O
ourselves O
changed O
, O
but O
not O
so O
much O
, O
or O
at O
least O
not O
inside O
. O

He O
is O
a O
little O
more O
voluminous O
, O
but O
he O
has O
the O
very O
face O
of O
men O
who O
are O
at O
peace O
with O
their O
conscience O
and O
above O
all O
are O
doing O
a O
job O
they O
love O
. O

Yes O
, O
because O
he O
, O
who O
graduated O
master O
in O
the O
far O
' O
68 O
, O
still O
manages O
not O
to O
be O
an O
automaton O
that O
windmills O
upside O
down O
and O
straight O
and O
gives O
tips O
to O
tokens O
, O
but O
he O
gets O
passionate O
, O
he O
lives O
the O
lesson O
, O
every O
lesson O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
the O
first O
of O
his O
career O
. O

We O
do O
not O
know O
if O
he O
is O
the O
dean O
of O
the O
masters O
of O
the O
region B-LOC
, O
it O
is O
certain O
, O
however O
, O
that O
a O
record O
has O
him O
: O

teaches O
for O
thirty O
years O
in O
the O
same O
circle O
- O
the O
Ct O
Riva O
- O
, O
a O
figure O
absolutely O
in O
contrast O
to O
what O
happens O
in O
almost O
all O
other O
realities O
, O
where O
the O
turn O
- O
over O
has O
become O
almost O
a O
rule O
. O

A O
beautiful O
record O
that O
, O
however O
, O
imposes O
a O
discounted O
question O
. O

How O
many O
toads O
have O
you O
had O
to O
swallow O
in O
30 O
years O
, O
Valerio B-PER
? O

Many O
, O
but O
all O
digestible O
. O

In O
the O
sense O
that O
I O
have O
used O
them O
to O
grow O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
grow O
, O
if O
you O
mess O
them O
up O
well O
, O
they O
also O
serve O
mistakes O
. O

How O
many O
presidents O
have O
you O
changed O
? O

" O
A O
difficult O
account O
, O
let O
's O
say O
a O
ten O
" O
. O

And O
did O
you O
get O
along O
with O
everyone O
? O

" O
Yes O
, O
there O
have O
never O
been O
any O
major O
problems O
" O
. O

But O
do O
you O
realize O
that O
, O
compared O
to O
other O
colleagues O
of O
yours O
, O
you O
are O
a O
white O
fly O
? O

" O
Yes O
, O
it O
is O
not O
frequent O
that O
a O
teacher O
stays O
so O
long O
in O
the O
same O
circle O
, O
but O
I O
have O
been O
favored O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
Riva B-LOC
I O
see O
it O
as O
the O
only O
city O
where O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
live O
, O
even O
if O
I O
have O
lived O
in O
Rome B-LOC
and O
Trento B-LOC
, O
and O
this O
I O
consider O
my O
circle O
and O
not O
the O
circle O
where O
I O
work O
. O

Significant O
that O
it O
has O
the O
card O
n O
° O
229 O
. O

And O
then O
I O
get O
attached O
to O
the O
kids O
who O
come O
to O
school O
and O
I O
always O
want O
to O
follow O
them O
, O
never O
lose O
sight O
of O
them O
. O

A O
Rivano O
doc O
( O
not O
surprisingly O
, O
they O
awarded O
him O
with O
the O
" O
" O
Anzolim O
de O
la O
Tor O
" O
) O
which O
, O
however O
, O
arrived O
in O
Riva B-LOC
in O
53 O
, O
at O
the O
age O
of O
six O
, O
following O
the O
father O
who O
had O
won O
the O
competition O
of O
municipal O
secretary O
. O

He O
was O
born O
in O
Polesine B-LOC
, O
in O
Castelnuovo B-LOC
Barriano I-LOC
, O
a O
village O
of O
mists O
and O
mosquitoes O
( O
it O
is O
near O
where O
the O
Po B-LOC
broke O
in O
' O
51 O
) O
. O

His O
new O
home O
, O
in O
Riva B-LOC
, O
was O
close O
to O
the O
Casina O
delle O
Magnolie O
- O
temple O
of O
the O
Benacense O
tennis O
of O
then O
, O
boasting O
excellent O
players O
such O
as O
Alberti B-PER
, O
Oradini B-PER
, O
Dallago B-PER
, O
Malossini B-PER
- O
and O
perhaps O
it O
was O
for O
what O
chose O
the O
sport O
of O
the O
racquet O
. O

His O
first O
teacher O
was O
a O
certain O
Masprone B-PER
, O
a O
Milanese O
transplanted O
on O
Garda B-LOC
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
I O
began O
with O
him O
, O
but O
then O
many O
teachers O
contributed O
to O
my O
formation O
: O

Max B-PER
Malossini I-PER
, O
Chiericatti B-PER
, O
a O
transplanted O
Rivano O
in O
Peru B-LOC
( O
was O
the O
discoverer O
of O
the O
great O
Alex B-PER
Olmedo I-PER
, O
ed O
. O
) O
, O
Mario B-PER
Comperini I-PER
. O

But O
it O
also O
helped O
me O
a O
lot O
the O
ing O
. O
Dallago B-PER
, O
a O
great O
player O
, O
but O
above O
all O
attentive O
to O
the O
youth O
activity O
. O

Then O
, O
at O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Ct O
Rovereto O
, O
where O
I O
found O
in O
Pipetto B-PER
Ferrari I-PER
a O
great O
president O
and O
especially O
a O
friend O
: O

He O
used O
to O
take O
me O
around O
making O
tournaments O
, O
cuddling O
me O
, O
almost O
a O
father O
to O
me O
. O

At O
the O
youth O
level O
, O
Valerio B-PER
won O
everything O
and O
then O
grew O
still O
touching O
, O
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
competitive O
career O
, O
the O
ranking O
of O
+2/6 O
of O
second B-ORG
category I-ORG
. O

An O
abstruse O
thing O
for O
those O
who O
are O
young O
or O
follow O
tennis O
recently O
, O
to O
what O
could O
it O
be O
related O
in O
the O
current O
rankings O
? O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
compare O
. O

Let O
's O
say O
I O
was O
close O
to O
zero O
that O
was O
half O
of O
the O
second B-ORG
category I-ORG
ranking O
. O

But O
it O
has O
to O
be O
said O
that O
- O
2 O
/ O
6 O
in O
Italy B-LOC
there O
were O
three O
or O
four O
and O
four O
or O
five O
were O
the O
first B-ORG
category I-ORG
" O
" O
. O

So O
you O
're O
up O
high O
? O

Well O
, O
enough O
is O
enough O
. O

Then O
you O
decided O
to O
be O
a O
teacher O
. O

It O
was O
the O
only O
outlet O
. O

The O
second B-ORG
tournaments O
were O
few O
, O
you O
had O
to O
spin O
a O
lot O
, O
there O
were O
no O
sponsors O
. O

Difficult O
years O
, O
in O
short O
, O
even O
though O
I O
took O
off O
some O
nice O
satisfactions O
, O
playing O
and O
winning O
with O
people O
who O
then O
made O
a O
career O
. O

So O
I O
went O
to O
Rome B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
national B-ORG
school I-ORG
teachers I-ORG
, O
and O
in O
two O
years O
, O
in O
' O
68 O
, O
I O
graduated O
. O

I O
immediately O
found O
place O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC
, O
then O
, O
from O
' O
74 O
, O
I O
came O
to O
Riva B-LOC
. O

And O
here O
I O
am O
. O

Fresh O
as O
a O
rose O
. O

" O
Enough O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
complain O
in O
short O
. O

Also O
because O
I O
could O
always O
work O
well O
and O
help O
many O
guys O
to O
grow O
up O
. O

There O
are O
some O
nice O
names O
that O
came O
out O
of O
your O
school O
. O

Andrea B-PER
and O
Luca B-PER
Stoppini O
, O
Enrico B-PER
Slopp I-PER
( O
the O
current O
head O
of O
the O
Pia O
, O
ed O
. O
) O
, O
Bernardo B-PER
Bernardinelli I-PER
, O
Francesca B-PER
Cicciarello I-PER
, O
Daniele B-PER
Remondini I-PER
, O
Leonardo B-PER
Lattisi I-PER
, O
Andrea B-PER
Pederzolli I-PER
, O
Barbara B-PER
Angelini I-PER
... O
many O
, O
in O
short O
and O
I O
'm O
afraid O
of O
forgetting O
some O
. O

Then O
we O
did O
the O
A B-ORG
- I-ORG
series I-ORG
, O
I O
was O
the O
non O
- O
player O
captain O
. O

There O
were O
Jack B-PER
Reader I-PER
- O
it O
was O
nice O
experience O
with O
him O
because O
he O
brought O
a O
breath O
of O
novelty O
- O
then O
Cohenour B-PER
, O
Philippians B-PER
, O
De B-PER
Minicis I-PER
. O

A O
nice O
team O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
enthusiasm O
even O
in O
the O
club O
" O
" O
. O

Speaking O
of O
enthusiasm O
, O
after O
the O
dark O
years O
it O
also O
seems O
to O
you O
that O
tennis O
is O
slowly O
rising O
up O
the O
slope O
? O

It O
's O
true O
, O
but O
please O
let O
's O
say O
it O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
, O
very O
low O
. O

A O
life O
with O
a O
racket O
in O
hand O
, O
who O
knows O
how O
many O
characters O
, O
how O
many O
anecdotes O
. O

It O
's O
pretty O
good O
. O

I O
played O
with O
Michele B-PER
Placido I-PER
, O
Antonella B-PER
Lualdi I-PER
and O
Fred B-PER
Bongusto I-PER
, O
I O
collaborated O
with O
Graziano B-PER
Risi I-PER
, O
current O
federal O
technical O
director O
, O
but O
above O
all O
I O
was O
lucky O
, O
operating O
in O
a O
tourist O
area O
, O
to O
compare O
myself O
with O
masters O
of O
other O
nations O
, O
Germans O
, O
Slavs O
... O

Is O
it O
harder O
to O
teach O
the O
reverse O
or O
set O
a O
mindset O
? O

The O
shot O
is O
the O
easiest O
thing O
, O
the O
hard O
one O
comes O
after O
. O

I O
have O
always O
preached O
that O
tennis O
, O
playing O
tennis O
, O
must O
be O
a O
joy O
even O
if O
you O
do O
it O
seriously O
. O

Then O
I O
realize O
that O
between O
parents O
and O
managers O
, O
children O
are O
overloaded O
with O
expectations O
and O
therefore O
stress O
. O

We O
teachers O
must O
move O
there O
in O
the O
middle O
and O
it O
is O
the O
most O
difficult O
part O
of O
our O
task O
. O

Now O
you O
have O
children O
who O
can O
have O
a O
future O
? O

" O
Yes O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O
" O

Let O
us O
leave O
them O
children O
and O
allow O
them O
to O
grow O
in O
peace O
. O

And O
in O
this O
my O
helpers O
Corinne B-PER
( O
Martinelli B-PER
, O
ed O
. O
) O
and O
Bernardo B-PER
( O
Bernardinelli B-PER
, O
ed O
. O
) O
are O
perfectly O
in O
tune O
. O

When O
are O
you O
gon O
na O
stop O
? O

When O
I O
get O
tired O
of O
being O
in O
the O
field O
, O
when O
I O
realize O
that O
I O
'm O
starting O
to O
let O
technical O
mistakes O
pass O
. O

That O
will O
be O
the O
sign O
that O
my O
career O
as O
a O
teacher O
is O
over O
. O

The O

with O
Paolo B-PER

Lanfranco B-PER
Cis I-PER
, O
explain O
what O
it O
means O
. O

What O
is O
the O
Dance O
Circuit O
? O

It O
is O
a O
project O
that O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
promotes O
in O
all O
Italian O
regions O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
making O
Italian O
and O
international O
dance O
known O
to O
more O
and O
more O
people O
. O

A O
promotion O
of O
dance O
, O
as O
do O
other O
European O
countries O
, O
carried O
out O
by O
encouraging O
the O
circulation O
of O
shows O
, O
accompanied O
by O
training O
initiatives O
. O

What O
will O
this O
project O
bring O
to O
Trentino B-LOC
? O

A O
greater O
presence O
of O
companies O
, O
dance O
shows O
and O
even O
a O
whole O
series O
of O
cultural O
and O
training O
activities O
: O

meetings O
, O
debates O
, O
workshops O
. O

But O
mostly O
shows O
. O

The O
circuit O
provides O
that O
there O
is O
a O
minimum O
to O
access O
this O
national O
regulation O
: O

In O
one O
year O
, O
at O
least O
24 O
shows O
must O
be O
filmed O
in O
the O
provincial O
territory O
. O

Does O
this O
mean O
access O
to O
an O
important O
source O
of O
funding O
? O

First O
of O
all O
to O
a O
substantial O
subsidy O
; O

but O
the O
interest O
is O
that O
the O
Trentino B-LOC
is O
identified O
as O
one O
of O
the O
territories O
on O
which O
to O
take O
a O
circuit O
, O
which O
has O
a O
national O
breath O
. O

It O
is O
also O
an O
acknowledgment O
for O
the O
association O
" O
International B-ORG
Meetings I-ORG
" O
of O
Rovereto B-LOC
for O
the O
work O
done O
through O
the O
Festival O
and O
the O
CID B-ORG
. O

An O
extremely O
positive O
news O
for O
us O
and O
for O
Rovereto B-LOC
, O
which O
is O
the O
home O
of O
both O
realities O
: O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
becomes O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
territories O
at O
national O
level O
and O
not O
only O
in O
the O
field O
of O
contemporary O
dance O
. O

You O
have O
been O
chosen O
as O
the O
only O
official O
contact O
person O
: O

will O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
institution O
be O
changed O
to O
manage O
the O
new O
function O
and O
the O
availability O
of O
funds O
? O

" O
No O
, O
nothing O
changes O
at O
all O
, O
because O
this O
is O
an O
activity O
that O
goes O
in O
addition O
to O
that O
of O
the O
festival O
. O

The O
association B-ORG
already O
operates O
in O
the O
field O
of O
dance O
at O
international O
level O

It O
has O
the O
necessary O
organizational O
skills O
, O
long O
experience O
and O
relationships O
with O
companies O
and O
institutes O
, O
which O
according O
to O
the O
Ministry O
enable O
it O
to O
organize O
the O
circuit O
as O
well O
as O
the O
circuit O

What O
will O
happen O
to O
Verona B-LOC

Mantua B-LOC

Will O
you O
have O
a O
say O
in O
this O
and O
will O
you O
sign O
this O

Each O

, O
each O
season O
will O
retain O
its O
autonomy O

There O
is O
nothing O
that O
is O
imposed O

This O
is O
an O
extra O
opportunity O
, O
an O
extra O
dance O
offer O
available O
to O

whole O

It O
should O
also O
be O
borne O
in O
mind O
that O
there O
are O
no O
dance O
seasons O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
; O

some O
shows O
are O
done O
sporadically O
, O
but O
not O
articulated O

nor O
much O
less O
a O

With O
this O
ministerial O
expectation O
there O
is O
instead O
the O
possibility O
to O
put O
on O
the O
net O
a O
series O

that O
want O

" O
. O

Will O
the O
festival O
then O
find O
a O
way O
to O
allocate O
the O
funds O
that O
have O
been O
made O
available O
to O
the O
other O
organizations O
and O
companies O
that O
dance O
? O

The O
ministerial O
fund O
is O
entrusted O
to O
" O
International B-ORG
Meetings I-ORG
" O
of O
Rovereto B-LOC
. O

This O
allows O
the O
organisation O
of O
a O
project O
to O
which O
other O
funds O
may O
also O
be O
added O
by O
the O
municipalities O
or O
by O
the O
province B-LOC
. O

This O
will O
give O
the O
possibility O
to O
organize O
an O
even O
wider O
and O
more O
important O
system O
than O
can O
be O
done O
with O
the O
ministerial O
contributions O
alone O
. O

So O
there O
will O
be O
other O
collaborations O
at O
local O
level O
? O

At O
the O
local O
level O
there O
will O
be O
an O
additional O
possibility O
on O
which O
it O
will O
always O
be O
possible O
to O
engage O
. O

In O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
it O
is O
an O
initiative O
that O
should O
stimulate O
the O
addition O
of O
other O
funding O
and O
collaborations O
by O
the O
municipalities O
or O
other O
bodies O
and O
associations O
. O

Are O
you O
already O
able O
to O
indicate O
some O
of O
them O
? O

We O
wait O
for O
the O
ministry O
to O
define O
the O
amount O
to O
be O
entrusted O
. O

This O
also O
depends O
on O
funding O
to O
the O
FUS O
( O
Single O
Show O
Fund O
) O
and O
will O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
financial O
manoeuvre O
. O

When O
we O
know O
how O
much O
will O
be O
available O
to O
us O
we O
will O
begin O
contacts O
with O
the O
Province B-LOC
that O
is O
our O
main O
partner O

then O
with O

The O

called O
for O

will O
be O
able O

the O

enter O
the O

Among O
these O
some O
companies O
- O
mostly O
Trentino O
- O
such O
as O
Tecnostile B-ORG
or O
Isocold B-ORG
that O
will O
join O
, O
as O

, O
their O

but O
also O
craft O
enterprises O
, O
such O
as O
that O
of O

, O
which O
after O
so O
many O
trumpet O
sounds O
out O
of O
time O
this O
time O
will O
actually O
enter O
the O
loop O

There O
seems O
to O
be O
even O
those O
, O
like O
Francesco B-PER

, O
one O
of O
Isocold B-ORG

members O
, O
willing O
to O
enter O

in O
a O
personal O
capacity O

From O
each O
of O
the O
new O
nine O
will O
come O
to O
replace O
the O
Trentino B-ORG
a O
quota O
of O
15 O
thousand O
euros O
; O

Overall O
, O
the O
share O
capital O
would O
thus O
rise O
to O
Euros O
270 O
thousand O
. O

At O
that O
point O
there O
would O
be O
only O
the O
much O

still O

done O
their O

and O
the O
expansion O
of O
the O
corporate O

would O
be O
a O
concrete O
proof O
of O
this O
and O
that O
the O
optimism O
around O

growing O

launched O
in O
the O

by O

Sartori I-PER
who O
will O

this O
evening O
to O
try O
to O
make O
the O
record O
on O
the O
Annapurna B-LOC
tour O
. O

A O
challenge O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
share O
with O
the O
Apeiron B-ORG
association O
that O
in O
Nepal B-LOC
manages O
some O
solidarity O
projects O
, O
including O
a O
home O
for O
mothers O
in O
difficulty O
and O
other O
support O

. O

The O
company O
will O
also O
serve O
to O
advertise O
and O
support O
the O
activity O
of O
Apeiron B-ORG
, O
since O
the O
sponsors O
of O
Sartori B-PER
also O
gave O
a O
contribution O
to O
the O
association O
that O
also O
has O
a O
headquarters O
in O
Pergine B-LOC
whose O
manager O
is O
lawyer O
Giuseppe B-PER
Benanti I-PER
. O

From O
a O
sporting O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
company O
is O
rather O
challenging O
. O

It O
is O
the O
most O
famous O
long O
trekking O
of O
the O
Himalayas B-LOC
, O
210 O
kilometers O
with O
a O
route O
starting O
from O
800 O
meters O
, O
rises O
to O
5 O
thousand O
and O
then O
rises O
to O
the O
starting O
altitude O
. O

So O
far O
the O
record O
of O
the O
route O
is O
nine O
days O
, O
set O
by O
four O
Germans O
. O

Sartori B-PER
plans O
to O
take O
four O
days O
. O

The O
Perugia O
sample O
is O
not O
new O
to O
companies O
like O
this O
. O

In O
1998 O
he O
ranked O
second O
in O
the O
world O
championship O
of O
high O
- O
altitude O
marathons O
in O
Tibet B-LOC
. O

This O
year O
he O
reached O
eighth O
in O
the O
100 O
km O
World O
Championship O
in O
Holland B-LOC
. O

In O
his O
career O
he O
won O
twice O
the O
Passatore O
's O
one O
hundred O
kilometers O
and O
won O
numerous O
other O
races O
. O

His O
specialty O
has O
become O
the O
so O
- O
called O
ultramarathon O
, O
a O
challenge O
to O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
impossible O
for O
normal O
people O
, O
daily O
bread O
for O
him O
. O

Sartori B-PER
, O
however O
, O
does O
not O
hide O
the O
difficulties O
: O

The O
objective O
I O
set O
myself O
is O
to O
travel O
210 O
kilometres O
in O
the O
shortest O
possible O
time O
. O

In O
theory O
I O
could O
do O
it O
in O
four O
days O
, O
thinking O
I O
could O
do O
52 O
kilometers O
a O
day O
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
said O
. O

The O
greatest O
difficulty O
is O
the O
altitude O
. O

The O
start O
is O
at O
840 O
meters O
, O
then O
you O
go O
up O
to O
5 O
thousand O
and O
400 O
and O
finally O
you O
go O
down O
again O
. O

The O
route O
is O
the O
classic O
one O
of O
the O
Annapurna B-LOC
trekking O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
famous O
of O
the O
Himalayas B-LOC
. O

I O
've O
already O
raced O
at O
high O
altitudes O
. O

In O
1998 O
I O
arrived O
second O
by O
surprise O
in O
the O
world O
championship O
in O
Tibet B-LOC
and O
I O
saw O
that O
I O
react O
well O
, O
but O
every O
race O
is O
a O
feat O
in O
itself O
. O

We O
need O
to O
see O
this O
time O
how O
it O
's O
gon O
na O
go O
. O

The O
real O
enterprise O
will O
start O
on O
16 O
October O
, O
after O
a O
few O
days O
of O
setting O
. O

The O
next O
day O
Sartori B-PER
should O
climb O
up O
to O
the O
Thorong B-LOC
Pass I-LOC
and O
from O
there O
begin O
the O
descent O
until O
arrival O
. O

He O
will O
run O
on O
a O
path O
about O
one O
metre O
wide O
and O
sleep O
in O
the O
lodges O
that O
usually O
welcome O
hikers O
who O
engage O
in O
trekking O
. O

To O
eat O
, O
Sartori B-PER
will O
have O
to O
arrange O
: O

I O
will O
carry O
myself O
in O
the O
backpack O
of O
supplements O
bars O
and O
pieces O
of O
grain O
that O
give O
energy O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
I O
will O
eat O
in O
the O
lodges O
. O

For O
accommodation O
there O
will O
be O
things O
that O
the O
carriers O
will O
bring O
before O
departure O
. O

From O
that O
point O
of O
view O
there O
should O
be O
no O
problems O
. O

Problems O
should O
not O
create O
them O
even O
the O
Maoist O
rebels O
who O
now O
control O
much O
of O
Nepal O
's O
territory O
: O

From O
what O
I O
know O
- O
Sartori B-PER
explains O
- O
they O
have O
never O
touched O
tourists O
, O
also O
because O
they O
know O
that O
they O
bring O
valuable O
currency O
and O
also O
buy O
local O
artifacts O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
can O
happen O
is O
that O
they O
stop O
you O
and O
give O
you O
a O
pistol O
on O
their O
Maoist O
principles O
, O
then O
they O
let O
you O
go O
after O
asking O
you O
for O
an O
oboleum O
of O
a O
few O
dollars O
. O

In O
short O
, O
there O
should O
be O
no O
special O
dangers O
. O

It O
remains O
the O
unknown O
represented O
by O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
undertaking O
added O
to O
the O
altitude O
: O

I O
just O
won O
a O
fifty O
kilometers O
in O
the O
plain O
in O
more O
than O
three O
hours O
. O

At O
those O
odds O
calculate O
to O
take O
six O
hours O
, O
if O
it O
's O
all O
right O
. O

We O
hope O
to O
keep O
this O
pace O
. O

However O
there O
are O
no O
precedents O
on O
which O
to O
rely O
. O

The O
only O
ones O
are O
these O
Germans O
who O
did O
it O
in O
nine O
days O
, O
but O
they O
were O
four O
. O

Something O
like O
that O
is O
nice O
to O
do O
on O
your O
own O
. O

his O

" O
I O
was O
three O

" O
he O
says O

I O
still O
remember O
the O
perfumes O
: O

not O
only O
the O

of O
the O

also O
those O
of O
plants O

And O
I O
remember O
the O
warm O
presence O
of O

But O
, O
just O
45 O
years O
from O
that O
time O

it O
is O
better O
not O
to O
ask O
him O
the O

He O
smiles O
and O
looks O
towards O
the O

This O
was O
not O
a O
simple O
routine O

operation O
- O
says O
Pacher B-PER

a O
brilliant O
operation O

It O
is O
a O
path O

different O

The O

the O

have O
to O

with O
Via B-ORG

The O
need O
to O
make O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
Federation B-ORG
more O
efficient O
and O
rational O
is O
one O
of O
the O
objectives O
given O
by O
Dellasega B-PER
as O
soon O
as O
he O
officially O
appointed O
director O
. O

Within O
a O

, O
therefore O
, O
should O
take O
shape O
that O
strategic O

that O
will O
have O
to O
define O
first O
of O
all O
the O
objectives O
that O
the O
Federation B-ORG
intends O
to O
focus O
towards O
the O
cooperative O
members O
who O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
are O
also O
customers O

Precisely O
on O
this O
double O
role O
of O
adherents O
to O
an O
organization O
that O
must O
make O
union O
and O
customers O
who O
use O
the O

will O
be O
played O
the O
drafting O
of O

and O
therefore O
the O
future O
reorganization O
of O
the O
enterprise O

led O
by O
Diego B-PER

On O
the O
basis O
of O
what O
had O
been O
repeated O
several O
times O
by O
the O
Director O
and O
the O
President O
himself O
, O
the O
need O
to O
change O
, O
by O
cascade O
, O
the O
procedures O
and O
methods O
, O
certainly O
not O
the O
men O
of O
the O
Federation B-ORG
. O

A O
change O
that O
both O
Schelfi B-PER
and O
Dellasega B-PER
want O
it O
to O
be O
shared O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
in O
order O
to O
give O
a O
different O
march O
to O
the O
organization O
. O

From O
communication O
, O
both O
internal O
and O
external O
, O
to O
continue O
with O
the O
ability O
to O
provide O
services O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
members O
. O

Just O
think O
of O
how O
many O
cooperatives O
, O
especially O
small O
ones O
, O
need O
the O
advice O
of O
the O
Federation B-ORG
now O
that O

Imagine O
if O

entered O
the O
world O
of O

Imagine O
your O
office O
emptied O
of O
everything O
, O
the O

cleaned O
out O

the O

It O
is O
not O
a O
delusion O
of O
the O

on O
duty O
and O
not O
even O
of O
the O
last O
episode O
of O

This O
is O
what O
happened O
last O
Saturday O
at O
a O

in O

brought O

renowned O

who O
have O
inserted O
their O
works O
in O
the O

This O
is O
an O
interesting O
idea O
which O
aims O
to O
compare O
it O
with O
the O
intermediate O
core O

Hence O
the O
title O
of O
the O
event O
: O
" O
Interfaces O

. O

To O
use O
the O
words O
of O
the O
curator O
Bonazzi B-PER
, O
this O
week O
" O
Asteria O
will O
not O
only O
be O
the O
place O
of O
the O
event O
, O
melting O
pot O
and O
crossroads O
of O
technical O
and O
creative O
synergies O
but O
also O
the O
center O
of O
exchanges O
and O
interactions O
. O

In O
this O
place O
, O
between O
media O
, O
multiple O
faces O
and O
borders O
, O
between O
connections O
and O
linguistic O
parameters O
, O
artists O
are O
encouraged O
to O
make O
their O
language O
interact O
with O
the O
new O
technologies O
. O

Let O
's O
see O
quickly O
and O
not O
exhaustively O
who O
the O
artists O
involved O
and O
what O
they O
proposed O
. O

Starting O
with O
Antoni B-PER
Abad I-PER
who O
created O
a O
" O
benign O
" O
virus O
consisting O
of O
a O
fly O
made O
of O
pixels O
that O
freely O
wanders O
through O
the O
computer O
screen O
and O
that O
through O
the O
Internet O
is O
able O
to O
multiply O
thus O
giving O
rise O
to O
a O
swarm O
of O
virtual O
flies O
. O

Then O
we O
turn O
to O
the O
works O
of O
Stefano B-PER
Cagol I-PER
and O
his O
games O
of O
doubles O
of O
the O
metropolitan O
horizon O
that O
recreate O
strange O
and O
familiar O
landscapes O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
Loris B-PER
Cecchini I-PER
's O
turn O
with O
his O
improbable O
yet O
real O
architecture O
that O
realizes O
the O
project O
of O
a O
house O
for O
squatter O
built O
on O
a O
pylon O
of O
light O
. O

Then O
again O
the O
dreamy O
and O
imaginary O
landscapes O
of O
Eva B-PER
Marisaldi I-PER
that O
brings O
the O
spectators O
on O
an O
imperturbable O
journey O
. O

Amazing O
the O
work O
of O
Takehito B-PER
Koganezawa I-PER
that O
gets O
incredibly O
sinphonies O
in O
sample O
images O
and O
noises O
of O
everyday O
life O
. O

Then O
the O
experimental O
video O
of O
Louis B-PER
Nero I-PER
that O
brings O
the O
experience O
of O
cinematography O
in O
video O
art O
with O
surprising O
results O
of O
poetry O
and O
existential O
suspension O
. O

The O
route O
between O
the O
business O
corridors O
continues O
with O
the O
work O
of O
Oliver B-PER
Pietsch I-PER
with O
three O
fragments O
of O
a O
path O
between O
the O
surreal O
and O
the O
real O
. O

Following O
Xenja B-PER
Plasma I-PER
with O
a O
video O
that O
is O
a O
lucid O
, O
obsessive O
and O
vibrant O
dream O
to O
the O
eternal O
search O
for O
hospitality O
. O

Sensual O
and O
transgressive O
is O
instead O
the O
work O
of O
Kiki B-PER
Seror I-PER
who O
borrows O
verbal O
images O
of O
chat O
- O
line O
highlighting O
what O
the O
web O
produces O
and O
proposes O
. O

The O
collective O
performance O
concludes O
a O
work O
by O
Giulia B-PER
Zuanni I-PER
who O
renounces O
communication O
for O
images O
by O
immersing O
the O
viewer O
in O
a O
dark O
and O
silent O
diade O
made O
only O
of O
intimate O
words O
, O
thus O
putting O
the O
viewer O
back O
at O
the O
center O
of O
the O
artistic O
event O
. O

The O
experiment O
of O
Asteria B-ORG
has O
certainly O
succeeded O
. O

The O
inauguration O
was O
not O
only O
an O
opportunity O
to O
meet O
and O
meet O
artists O
and O
communication O
staff O
but O
also O
an O
event O
open O
to O
the O
city O
and O
, O
at O
the O
end O
, O
for O
the O

It O

The O

Cardini B-PER
: O

It O
is O
not O
true O

there O
are O
uncompromising O
differences O

an O
abyss O
of O

The O

is O
reborn O
in O
the O

The O
only O
way O
out O

this O

to O
disassemble O
the O
Manichaean O
vision O
that O
is O
given O
to O

Yet O
the O
relations O
between O
Islam O
and O
the O
Christian O
world O
have O
never O
been O
easy O
... O

This O
too O
is O
all O
to O
see O
: O

historically O
there O
was O
the O
clash O
, O
but O
also O
the O
encounter O
. O

Islam O
and O
Christendom O
first O
and O
then O
Europe B-LOC
, O
have O
had O
reports O
for O
thirteen O
centuries O
that O
have O
also O
been O
of O
violence O
, O
enmity O
, O
but O
always O
within O
a O
connection O

a O
bond O
that O
has O
never O
been O
interrupted O
: O

Despite O
the O
crusades O
, O
trade O
, O
diplomatic O
and O
cultural O
relations O
continued O
. O

At O
times O
, O
however O
, O
a O
" O
dealing O
ideology O
" O
has O
certainly O
prevailed O
, O
particularly O
between O
1400 O
and O
1700 O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fear O
of O
the O
Turks O
who O
were O
pressing O
at O
the O
borders O
of O
Catholic O
Europe B-LOC

And O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
the O
Muslim O
world O
, O
how O
was O
this O
relationship O
lived O
? O

Islam O
too O
has O
developed O
a O
completely O
speculative O
" O
dealing O
ideology O
" O
after O
the O
experience O
of O
contact O
with O
the O
West O
: O

He O
felt O
endangered O
by O
the O
crusades O
, O
colonialism O
, O
and O
then O
by O
the O
support O
given O
to O
Israel B-LOC
, O
and O
dusted O
up O
the O
enmity O
towards O
Europe B-LOC
, O
but O
it O
was O
never O
continued O
. O

And O
as O
in O
the O
West O
, O
here O
too O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
global O
conflict O
has O
developed O
. O

But O
everything O
falls O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
what O
we O
might O
call O
small O
and O
large O
optical O
phenomena O
: O

astigmatism O
, O
myopia O
, O
presbyopia O
, O
the O
inability O
to O
see O
things O
in O
their O
right O
proportions O
. O

Moreover O
, O
Europeans O
have O
also O
fought O
among O
themselves O
for O
religious O
reasons O
: O

I O
believe O
that O
Muslims O
and O
Westerners O
will O
never O
be O
able O
to O
achieve O
the O
level O
of O
hatred O
and O
ferocity O
achieved O
, O
for O

, O
by O
the O
wars O
of O
religion O
in O
1400 O
- O
1500 O
in O
Europe B-LOC

Yet O
they O

creation O

common O
European O
consciousness O

How O
then O
to O
consider O
the O
failed O
attempt O
of O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Italian O
political O
world O
to O
have O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
Christian O
origins O
of O
the O
Eruopa B-LOC
inserted O
into O
the O
European O
Constitution O
? O

When O
we O
talk O
about O
cultural O
roots O
we O
must O
resist O
the O
simplistic O
and O
fundamentalist O
temptation O
of O
the O
aut O
aut O
, O
because O
usually O
cultures O
develop O
on O
et O
et O
, O
that O
is O
, O
on O
the O
coexistence O
of O
different O
traditions O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
Europe B-LOC
has O
Christian O
roots O
, O
but O
these O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
are O
not O
the O
only O
ones O
. O

The O
crusades O
began O
in O
a O
period O
of O
crisis O
of O
Christendom O
, O
cultural O
and O
economic O
: O

seems O
to O
be O
the O
situation O
of O
today O
's O
Arab O
countries O
. O

Is O
Islam O
a O
reverse O
crusade O
? O

- O
No O
. O
- O
Mm O
- O
hmm O
. O
- O
Mmm O
- O
hmm O
. O
- O
Mmm O
- O
hmm O

In O
current O
Islam O
there O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
process O
, O
very O
limited O
qualitatively O
and O
quantitatively O
, O
of O
degeneration O
, O
which O
has O
typically O
Western O
roots O
and O
connotations O
. O

In O
practice O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
latest O
developments O
in O
globalization O
that O
accentuates O
and O
makes O
evident O
to O
all O
the O
enormous O
inequalities O
between O
the O
West O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Islamic O
world O
has O
identified O
in O
the O
development O
of O
the O
rich O
countries O
the O
motive O
of O
Muslim O
decadence O
. O

So O
we O
started O
from O
a O
historically O
true O
observation O
, O
but O
it O
is O
used O
in O
a O
captious O
way O
to O
justify O
the O
necessity O
of O
holy O
war O
. O

What O
are O
our O
responsibilities O
in O
this O
? O

European O
culture O
is O
now O
in O
the O
grip O
of O
a O
dangerous O
schizophrenia O
: O

We O
have O
built O
our O
identity O
for O
at O
least O
three O
centuries O
on O
values O
such O
as O
equality O
, O
freedom O
and O
social O
justice O
that O
we O
continue O
not O
to O
respect O
in O
our O
relations O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

And O
then O
the O
fundamentalist O
reaction O
is O
also O
a O
reaction O
to O
the O
disillusionment O
caused O
to O
the O
Muslim O
countries O
by O
the O
contact O
with O
the O
West O
, O
which O
first O
promised O
independence O
and O
development O
and O
then O
denied O
everything O
. O

But O
why O
has O
religion O
become O
the O
vehicle O
of O
this O
confrontation O
? O

" O
Because O
religious O
discourse O
takes O
place O
in O
an O
Islamic O
world O
made O
up O
of O
a O
billion O
three O
hundred O
million O
people O
who O
are O
part O
of O
that O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
earth B-LOC
's O
population O
living O
in O
poverty O
. O
" O

In O
the O
face O
of O
this O
element O
of O
colossal O
injustice O
, O
what O
is O
the O
language O
that O
any O
political O
agitator O
could O
choose O
to O
strike O
consciences O
? O

It O
is O
the O
religious O
language O
that O
indicates O
in O
the O
western O
world O
" O
Judaic O
- O
Christian O
- O
atheist O
" O
the O
great O
satan O
guilty O
of O
everything O
" O
. O

Where O
does O
fundamentalism O
come O
from O
? O

The O
Islamic O
fundamentalist O
movement O
is O
a O
new O
movement O
born O
in O
the O
1920s O
as O
a O
short O
circuit O
in O
front O
of O
the O
violence O
of O
Western O
expansion O
. O

There O
is O
a O
rediscovery O
of O
religious O
values O
lived O
paradoxically O
in O
a O
very O
Western O
way O
, O
ideologicalized O
: O

is O
the O
image O
of O
an O
Islam O
in O
war O
that O
must O
win O
against O
the O
western O
satan O
that O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
traditional O
one O
. O

Luckily O
that O
despite O
the O
efforts O
we O
make O
with O
our O
choices O
to O
promote O
fundamentalism O
, O
the O
Muslims O
who O
adhere O
to O
it O
are O
few O
, O
so O
I O
believe O
that O
fundamentalism O
will O
never O
develop O
more O
than O
that O
. O

Yet O
the O
attacks O
continue O
, O
indeed O
, O
increases O
the O
intensity O
of O
violence O
... O

But O
that O
's O
why O
terrorist O
movements O
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
dangerous O
: O

because O
they O
realize O
that O
their O
development O
area O
is O
very O
limited O
and O
then O
harden O
their O
practice O
. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
tragedy O
of O
Beslan B-LOC
comes O
from O
. O

Let O
's O
explore O
the O
opposite O
field O
, O
the O
Western O
one O
. O

Does O
not O
the O
war O
against O
terrorism O
risk O
having O
all O
the O
characteristics O
of O
a O
politically O
and O
religiously O
fundamentalist O
crusade O
? O

There O
is O
an O
aspect O
, O
for O
example O
with O
regard O
to O
Bush B-PER
and O
his O
circle O
, O
that O
if O
I O
were O
not O
a O
believer O
I O
would O
call O
religious O
involution O
in O
a O
fanatic O
sense O
. O

I O
am O
a O
practicing O
Catholic O
, O
I O
do O
not O
like O
to O
talk O
about O
religious O
involution O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
return O
to O
crude O
forms O
of O
relationship O
between O
religion O
and O
politics O
. O

When O
I O
see O
the O
images O
of O
Americans O
praying O
at O
Ground O
Zero O
, O
I O
smell O
the O
mass O
media O
ambo O
and O
the O
power O
of O
the O
fanatical O
ideological O
apparatus O
. O

Praying O
together O
in O
front O
of O
television O
aloud O
is O
not O
my O
way O
of O
understanding O
religion O
. O

In O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
there O
is O
an O
old O
Protestant O
fundamentalist O
root O
, O
linked O
to O
what O
they O
call O
the O
nation O
's O
" O
manifest O
destiny O
. O
" O

Is O
this O
religion O
? O

It O
is O
a O
political O
vision O
of O
faith O
. O

Does O
that O
mean O
a O
crusade O
spirit O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
exists O
in O
Islamic O
Jihad O
but O
also O
in O
the O
current O
Western O
world O
. O

How O
can O
you O
get O
out O
of O
this O
vicious O
circle O
? O

Is O
that O
possible O
? O

Not O
right O
now O
. O

The O
only O
way O
is O
to O
disassemble O
the O
Manichaean O
vision O
that O
is O
given O
to O
us O
by O
the O
media O
, O
caught O
by O
politicians O
and O
strong O
powers O
, O
of O
a O
world O
divided O
in O
two O
between O
evil O
and O
good O
. O

We O
must O
react O
as O
they O
did O
in O
France B-LOC
after O
the O
kidnapping O
of O
journalists O
. O

As O
a O
right O
- O
wing O
man O
and O
as O
a O
European O
citizen O
I O
was O
proud O
of O
the O
national O
sentiment O
and O
unity O
, O
of O
the O
compactness O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
expressed O
to O
the O
French O
. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O

They O
did O
n't O
give O
in O
to O
blackmail O
: O

to O
the O
kidnappers O
who O
call O
for O
the O
abolition O
of O
the O
veil O
law O
in O
a O
unified O
way O
, O
from O
right O
to O
left O
, O
it O
has O
been O
replied O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
law O
against O
the O
Muslims O
and O
the O
Muslim O
community O
itself O
, O
contrary O
to O
the O
law O
, O
rejected O
the O
external O
interference O
. O

But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
France B-LOC
is O
not O
even O
aligned O
with O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
has O
another O
idea O
of O
what O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
in O
Iraq B-LOC

in O
particular O
the O
role O

the O
UN B-ORG

The O
logic O
of O

on O
the O
opposite O
sides O
is O
to O
make O
us O
partisans O

one O
or O

I O
would O
like O
to O
remember O
that O
Iginio B-PER

with O
Alberto B-PER
Agostini I-PER

was O
the O
one O
who O
fought O
for O
the O

governor O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Trento B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
1970s O
. O

A O
free O
man O
, O
accepted O
the O
confrontation O
with O
an O
open O
face O
. O

Many O
announcements O
and O
the O
usual O
promises O
: O

but O
the O
bike O
life O
is O
getting O
harder O
and O
harder O

The O
teasing O
of O
bikes O

The O
other O
day O
, O
another O
incident O
involving O
a O
cyclist O
. O

At O
the O
intersection O
between O
Via B-LOC
Vittorio I-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
and O
Via B-LOC
Lorenzoni I-LOC
: O

On O
the O
cycle O
- O
pedestrian O
stripes O
, O
it O
was O
shot O
down O
by O
a O
car O
passing O
through O
the O
now O
famous O
roundabout O
. O

Fortunately O
there O
were O
no O
serious O
consequences O
: O

The O
man O
suffered O
a O
trauma O
to O
the O
head O
, O
but O
he O
never O
lost O
consciousness O
and O
was O
accompanied O
to O
the O
hospital O
by O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
for O
investigations O
. O

The O
accident O
, O
however O
, O
proposes O
a O
series O
of O
questions O
, O
which O
concern O
the O
micro O
( O
the O
mockery O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
cycle O
path O
of O
Via B-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
) O
and O
the O
macro O
( O
the O
policy O
for O
cyclists O
of O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
) O
. O

As O
for O
via B-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
, O
the O
telenovela O
of O
the O
bike O
path O
is O
now O
at O
the O
last O
stage O
, O
that O
of O
de O
profundis O
. O

Inaugurated O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
, O
the O
track O
occupies O
half O
the O
sidewalk O
forcing O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
to O
an O
impossible O
coexistence O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
is O
not O
even O
a O
bike O
path O
: O

It O
's O
just O
a O
white O
stripe O
of O
paint O
. O

The O
cycle O
path O
of O
Via B-LOC
Veneto I-LOC
has O
always O
been O
a O
colossal O
joke O
: O

dangerous O
for O
the O
safety O
of O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
, O
ends O
unmistakably O
in O
nothingness O
. O

At O
the O
crossroads O
of O
Via B-LOC
Mattioli I-LOC
goes O
straight O
against O
the O
new O
cast O
iron O
railings O
. O

In O
some O
stretches O
( O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Bronzetti O
) O
it O
is O
less O
than O
forty O
centimeters O
wide O
, O
which O
must O
be O
sufficient O
for O
cyclists O
passing O
in O
both O
directions O
. O

If O
the O
Public B-ORG
Works I-ORG
Inspectorate I-ORG
applies O
the O
Road O
Code O
, O
it O
should O
denounce O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
. O

Just O
look O
a O
few O
kilometers O
from O
here O
( O
I O
do O
n't O
say O
to O
Bolzano B-LOC
... O
enough O
Rovereto B-LOC
) O
to O
notice O
two O
things O
: O

bike O
paths O
are O
separated O
from O
pedestrian O
traffic O
; O

and O
are O
marked O
with O
red O
asphalt O
. O

And O
here O
the O
problem O
is O
more O
general O
, O
that O
of O
the O
politics O
of O
this O
city O
for O
cyclists O
. O

I O
remember O
perfectly O
a O
press O
conference O
in O
1986 O
in O
which O
the O
Councillor O
Roberto B-PER
De I-PER
Bernardis I-PER
, O
riding O
a O
regular O
bike O
, O
called O
the O
press O
to O
the O
" O
Sailor O
" O
to O
explain O
that O
Trento B-LOC
would O
have O
by O
1994 O
an O
efficient O
network O
of O
bike O
paths O
from O
north O
to O
south O
and O
combs O
in O
the O
historic O
center O
" O
. O

Bullshit O
. O

They O
've O
been O
making O
fun O
of O
us O
for O
so O
many O
years O
. O

We O
cyclists O
, O
who O
try O
to O
fight O
smog O
and O
take O
on O
a O
healthier O
and O
more O
ecological O
mobility O
, O
are O
sacrificed O
on O
the O
altar O
of O
engines O
. O

When O
we O
are O
not O
killed O
at O
the O
cycle O
- O
pedestrian O
passages O
as O
happened O
to O
yesterday O
's O
miscapitulate O
. O

But O
it O
is O
known O
, O
Trento B-LOC
is O
the O
alpine O
city O
of O
2004 O
. O

Which O
means O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
; O

but O
in O
reality O
, O
music O
is O
always O
the O
usual O
: O

on O
two O
wheels O
, O
risk O
the O
skin O
. O

And O
they O
're O
making O
fun O
of O
you O
