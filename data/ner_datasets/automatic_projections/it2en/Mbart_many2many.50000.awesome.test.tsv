not O

To O
ask O
those O

to O
look O
for O
somebody O

does O
n't O
cheat O

ca O
n't O
cheat O

and O
is O
therefore O
able O
to O
offer O
a O
certainty O

for O
it O

stay O
in O
the O
tower O

facing O
north O
towards O
the O
top O
of O
the O
ramp O

incoming O
traffic O

From O
there O
, O
he O
had O
to O
operate O
a O
high O

powered O
manual O
torch O
of O
three O
million O
candles O
, O
which O
he O
had O
to O
turn O
on O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
vehicles O
approaching O
. O

When O
the O
lights O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
ineffective O
, O
he O
should O
have O
fired O
a O
warning O
shot O
at O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
vehicle O
as O
it O
ran O
over O
the O
ramp O

At O
that O
point O
, O
if O
the O
vehicle O
had O
continued O
to O
approach O
, O
it O
would O
have O
to O
lift O
the O
weapon O
up O
and O
use O
it O
to O
disable O
the O
vehicle O
, O
focusing O
on O
the O
engine O
and O
the O
wheels O
. O

Finally O
, O
when O
the O
vehicle O
had O
n't O
stopped O
yet O
, O
he O
was O
going O
to O
have O
to O
continue O
firing O

Just O
five O

according O

For O

, O
the O

" O
he O
felt O

said O

about O

the O

, O
screaming O

but O
no O

both O

turning O
it O

now O

" O
the O
judge O
said O

The O
perpetrator O
of O
the O
crime O
, O
Tarquini B-PER
said O
, O
" O
It O
was O
a O
kind O
of O
punishment O
from O

did O
not O
respect O

lead O
to O
something O

which O
is O
respect O

" O

" O
I O
think O
that O
Muslim O

also O
leads O
to O
respect O
for O
life O

and O
not O
the O
other O
way O
around O

the O

pointed O
out O

Those O
who O
commit O
crimes O
in O
the O

of O
religion O
violate O
religion O
itself O

its O
founding O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
Islam O
caused O
this O
tragedy O

His O
incorrect O
reading O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
an O
aberration O

" O

According O
to O
the O
prosecutor O
, O
Hina B-PER

murderers O
were O
her O
father O

Mohamed B-PER
Saleem I-PER

51 O

her O
uncle O

Mohamad B-PER
Tariq I-PER

; O
and O
perhaps O
Hina B-PER
's O
older O
sister O

younger O

The O
father O
would O
have O
cut O
Hina B-PER

throat O

with O
the O
full O
cooperation O
of O
the O
other O
two O

That O

why O
the O
accusation O

identical O
to O
everybody O

premeditated O
murder O
and O
the O
cover O

up O

The O
prosecutor O
has O
suffered O
for O
a O
long O
time O
from O
the O
presumption O
of O
innocence O

it O
's O
assumed O
that O
the O

invited O
home O
by O
deception O
and O
that O
the O
mother O
and O
the O

were O
separated O
in O

act O
calmly O

The O
relationship O
between O
the O
young O
woman O
and O
the O
father O
has O
not O
been O
good O
for O
years O
. O

He O
could O
n't O
stand O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
girl O
was O
dressed O
in O
Western O
clothes O

working O

She O
also O
had O

most O

she O
did O

her O

It O
remains O
to O
be O

whether O

how O
Saleem B-PER
knew O
about O

with O
Giuseppe B-PER
Tampini I-PER

the O
33 O

that O
the O

Since O

out O

According O

, O
" O
the O
case O

whose O

killed O
her O
teaches O
us O
a O
lot O
about O

it O

it O

enough O

" O
but O
it O

also O
necessary O
to O
demand O
adherence O

the O
fact O
that O

" O

So O
the O
minister O
added O
that O
one O
right O
that O
should O
be O
considered O
universal O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
" O
women O
have O
the O
right O

choose O
their O

" O

The O
man O
explains O
that O
the O
tragedy O

generate O
hatred O

ROMA B-LOC
-- O
A O
campaign O
of O
attacks O
against O
the O
left O
, O
even O
harder O
than O
in O
2001 O
. O

Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
is O
offering O
his O
allies O
his O
eternal O
recipe O
for O
defeating O
Prodi B-PER
and O
staying O
in O
government O
in O
the O
new O
legislature O
. O

His O
political O
analysis O
is O
simple O
. O

Italians O
are O
a O
moderate O
people O
, O
they O
're O
not O
going O
to O
give O
the O
keys O
to O
a O
coalition O
that O
has O
no O
agenda O
. O

In O
the O
regions O
, O
the O
CDL B-ORG
lost O
out O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
enthusiasm O
of O
the O
disappointed O
. O

However O
, O
the O
first O
mate O
realizes O
that O
they O
need O
something O
new O
, O
and O
the O
announcement O
of O
a O
one O
- O
party O
merger O
certainly O
does O
n't O
ease O
the O
displeasure O
of O
the O
first O
mates O
, O
UDC B-ORG
and O
An B-ORG
. O

Today O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
see O
how O
the O
Knight O

final O
moves O
are O
going O
to O
be O
evaluated O
at O
the O
U.D. B-ORG
Congress O
and O
the O
National O
Assembly O
in O
Ann B-ORG
. O

The O
impression O
is O
that O
the O
allies O
are O
overwhelmed O
with O
self O
- O
interest O
, O
looking O
for O
an O
electoral O
strategy O
. O

It O
's O
no O
accident O
that O
Alemanno B-PER
asks O
that O
An B-ORG
hold O
a O
programmatic O
conference O
within O
the O
year O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
" O
new O
Fiuggi O
, O
" O
as O
a O
condition O
not O
to O
create O
an O
internal O
minority O
-- O
and O
this O
would O
be O
the O
first O
time O
that O
Fini B-PER
would O
not O
get O
unanimity O
in O
his O
party O
. O

In O
the O
U.D. B-ORG
, O
perhaps O
Giovanardi B-PER
will O
not O
compete O
with O
Follini B-PER
, O
even O
because O
the O
projection O
of O
the O
single O
party O
beyond O
the O
policies O
of O
2006 O
makes O
a O
Congressional O
battle O
so O
premature O
rather O
surreal O
. O

But O
Berlusconi B-PER
also O
faces O
two O
other O
problems O
. O

the O
League B-ORG
and O
the O
Socialists B-ORG
. O

The O
first O
, O
as O
Bondi B-PER
recognizes O
, O
remains O
for O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
" O
a O
vital O
alignment O
, O
" O
and O
that O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
single O
party O
can O
not O
become O
a O
path O
against O
Bossi B-PER

So O
he O
needs O
a O
softer O
approach O

As O
far O
as O
the O
socialists O
are O
concerned O
, O
yesterday O
's O
meeting O
between O
De B-PER
Michelis I-PER
and O
Boselli B-PER
represented O
a O
step O
forward O
on O
the O
path O
of O
socialist O
unity O

Despite O
all O
the O
odds O
, O
the O
New B-ORG
Dog O
seems O
to O
have O
begun O
leaving O
the O
DRC B-ORG
, O
even O
for O
the O
inability O
to O
recognize O
himself O
in O
a O
single O
P.P.-inspired B-ORG
party O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
De B-PER
Michelis I-PER
goes O
on O
to O
say O
that O
the O
operation O
must O
remain O
outside O
the O
" O
business O
as O
usual O
, O
" O
but O
once O
the O
Fed B-ORG
is O
overthrown O

the O
socialist O
unity O
only O
seems O
possible O
inside O
the O
center O

left O

Boselli B-PER
talks O
about O
an O
encouraging O
conversation O

does O
n't O
rule O
out O
further O
radicalization B-ORG

face O

Nichi B-PER

who O

long O

So O
it O
's O
normal O
that O
a O
climate O
of O
excitement O
would O
have O

over O

sometimes O
to O

on O

" O

for O

a O

passed O

told O

The O
first O

because O
from O

from O

And O
if O
anybody O
thought O

we O

recovered O
the O

we O
remember O
that O
there O

so O
many O

it O

to O
all O

that O

ROME B-LOC
-- O
Four O
days O
after O
the O
vote O
, O
a O
strong O
call O
for O
a O
reform O
dialogue O
was O
made O
to O
the O
two O
police O
departments O
by O
President O
Giorgio B-PER
Napolitano I-PER
of O
the O
Republic O
. O

During O
his O
visit O
to O
Naples B-LOC
, O
the O
head O
of O
state O
invited O
voters O
to O
go O
to O
the O
polls O
because O
, O
" O
It O
's O
too O
important O
the O
subject O
that O
everybody O
is O
invited O
to O
speak O
on O
, O
you O
think O
about O
it O
anyway O
. O
" O

But O
Napolitano B-PER
also O
asked O
the O
two O
opposing O
factions O
, O
" O
Whatever O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
vote O
, O
" O
to O
bring O
the O
debate O
on O
reforms O
back O
to O
Parliament O
, O
" O
in O
search O
of O
the O
broadest O
possible O
consensus O
. O
" O

The O
appeal O
draws O
consensus O
between O
the O
two O
camps O
. O

especially O
from O
the O
center O
- O
right O
, O
which O
judges O
this O
in O
a O
particularly O
positive O
way O
because O
it O
goes O
along O
with O
the O
other O
call O
to O
" O
do O
n't O
destroy O
" O
all O
the O
activities O
of O
the O
Berlusconi O
government O
. O

But O
the O
clash O
between O
the O
two O
poles O
is O
still O
strong O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
very O
first O
distance O
fight O
between O
Berlusconi B-PER
and O
Prodi B-PER

an O
opportunity O

no O

government O

with O
its O
11 O

" O

Prodi B-PER
responds O
shortly O
after O
Moscow B-LOC

Berlusconi B-PER
, O
the O
prime O
minister O
argues O
, O
" O
is O
ready O
to O
screw O
up O
the O

lesson O

And O
yet O
, O
Napolitano B-PER

intervention O
had O
some O
results O
. O

The O
entire O
center O
- O
right O
says O
it O
's O
ready O
to O
compete O
with O
the O
center O
- O
left O
after O
the O
June O
25th O

Sandro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
calls O
it O
" O
an O
important O
and O
courageous O
reminder O
, O
" O
and O
Maurizio B-PER
Gasparri I-PER
gives O
us O
almost O
a O
hint O
of O
why O
it O
is O
. O

even O
the O
lawyer O
Roberto B-PER
Calderoli I-PER
, O
who O
is O
usually O
very O
tough O
with O
the O
head O
of O
state O
, O
puts O
aside O
the O
controversy O
and O
says O
yes O
to O
dialogue O
. O

But O
under O
one O
condition O
: O

that O
the O
reform O
is O
approved O
and O
enters O
into O
force O
immediately O
. O

" O
When O
it O
's O
taken O
off O
, O
we O
can O
discuss O
how O
to O
make O
it O
better O
, O
" O
is O
his O
position O
. O

The O
Union B-ORG
does O
n't O
like O
this O
sort O
of O
center O
- O
right O
hand O
- O
cuffing O
in O

because O
it O

But O
the O
signs O
are O
that O
the O

beyond O

become O
a O
comparison O

When O
the O
Minister O
of O
Education O
made O
his O
way O
into O
the O
crowd O
, O
and O
this O
is O
where O
some O
of O
the O

preparatory O
protest O
took O
place O

many O
of O
them O
wearing O

against O

" O
Morttila O

" O

Tensions O
broke O
down O
, O
and O
some O
called O
on O
the O
minister O
to O
ensure O
that O
his O
innocence O
and O
his O
family O

innocence O
were O
stopped O
. O

But O
Leticia B-PER
Moratti I-PER
did O
n't O
give O
up O
. O

took O
part O
in O
the O

about O
200 O

at O

of O
the O

, O
Vittorio B-LOC
Emanuele I-LOC
left O
the O
demonstration O
, O
still O
in O
the O

The O
minister O
explained O
, O
however O
, O
that O
she O
had O
" O
not O
left O
the O
courtroom O
, O
" O
but O
that O
she O
had O
come O

that O

was O
already O

her O

The O
challenge O
to O
Latvia B-PER

Moratti I-PER
was O
almost O
unanimous O
. O

" O
Whoever O

here O
does O
n't O
deserve O
a O
whistle O
, O
recognizes O
the O
value O
of O
April O
25th O

" O

I O
totally O
disagree O
. O

This O
is O
the O
party O
of O
unity O
, O
not O
division O
, O
" O
Prodi B-PER
said O
. O

And O
expressions O
of O
solidarity O
came O
from O
Ferrante B-PER
, O
Veltroni B-PER
, O
Albertini B-PER
, O
Formigoni B-PER
and O
many O
, O
many O

from O
both O
the O

the O

Also O
fueling O
the O
tension O
were O
two O
Israeli O
flags O
that O
were O
burned O
by O
some O
militants O
. O

The O
first O
one O
happened O
in O
the O

where O
a O
few O
dozen O
[ O

at O
one O
point O
climbed O
up O

threw O
an O
Israeli O

at O
the O

The O
scene O
repeated O
itself O
later O
when O
, O
in O
the O
course B-LOC

the O

removed O
another O

Crotone B-PER
speakers O
: O
" O

CROTO B-LOC
: O
There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
all O
the O
regions O
of O
Italy B-LOC
, O
the O
northern O
and O
the O
southern O
regions O
, O
are O
connected O
by O
a O
national O
solidarity O
pact O
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
the O
central O
state O

duty O
to O
help O
the O
least O
- O
favoured O
regions O
of O
the O
Mezzogiorno O
, O
especially O
to O
build O
the O

. O

Carlo B-PER
Azeglio I-PER
Ciampi I-PER
wanted O
to O
recapitulate O
this O
in O
Crotone B-LOC
, O
with O
a O
talk O
on O
institutional O
pedagogy O
that O
contains O
strong O
appeals O
to O
the O
duties O
of O
Southern O
citizens O
and O
the O
spirit O
of O
responsibility O
that O
should O
inspire O
their O
managers O
. O

The O
speech O
was O
also O
directed O
by O
the O
large O
number O
of O
schoolchildren O
who O
attended O
and O
participated O
on O
the O
courts O
of O
the O
Sports O
Palace O
where O
the O
head O
of O
state O
spoke O
, O
in O
front O
of O
a O
crowd O
of O
local O
councillors O
and O
city O
councillors O
. O

Young O
people O
, O
he O
basically O
asked O
them O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
two O
things O
: O

of O
the O
" O
good O
fortune O
" O
of O
finally O
living O
in O
a O
peaceful O
Europe B-LOC
and O
of O
the O
need O
to O
be O
artists O
of O
further O
progress O
. O

Because O
, O
he O
told O
them O
, O
the O
future O
will O
be O
what O
you O
build O
. O

Without O
ever O
mentioning O
the O
word O
federalism O
, O
Ciampi B-PER
said O
: O

" O
The O
united O
Italy B-LOC
has O
a O
duty O
to O
devote O
special O
attention O
to O
the O
least O
developed O
regions O
, O
" O
because O
the O
country O
is O
one O
, O
and O
its O
problems O
are O
problems O
of O
all O
, O
to O
be O
solved O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
all O
. O

But O
that O
does O
n't O
necessarily O
mean O
ignoring O
the O
most O
advanced O
regions O
, O
which O
need O
to O
be O
stimulated O
and O
sustained O
to O
remain O
globally O
competitive O
. O

" O
Italy B-LOC
, O
again O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
is O
one O
. O

His O
problems O
, O
although O
different O
in O
different O
areas O
, O
are O
problems O
of O
everybody O
, O
and O
it O
's O
in O
everybody O
's O
interest O
to O
solve O
each O
one O
of O
them O
. O
" O

So O
it O
's O
right O
that O
the O
South O
should O
rely O
on O
the O
richer O
North O
. O

that O
the O
central O
state O
performs O
its O
balance O

Well O
, O
if O
you O
think O
about O
it O
-- O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
much O
to O
think O
about O
it O
-- O
it O
's O
a O
common O
- O
sense O
solution O
. O

Since O
everyone O
had O
been O
waiting O
for O
2006 O
for O
the O
return O
of O
the O
tornadoes O
from O
Montevideo B-LOC
to O
Vason B-LOC
for O
years O
, O
this O
time O
really O
where O
Bondone B-LOC
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
, O
there O
was O
really O
no O
point O
in O
any O
other O
solution O
. O

But O
passing O
it O
was O
n't O
easy O
, O
because O
by O
now O
in O
Milan B-LOC
, O
the O
idea O
that O
was O
circulating O
, O
just O
seven O
weeks O
after O
the O
inauguration O
of O
the O
track O
presentation O
, O
was O
the O
one O
that O
had O
already O
been O
confirmed O
in O
the O
Province B-LOC
: O

just O
a O
crossover O
to O
the O
top O
and O
pushed O
back O
to O
the O
headlights O
, O
a O
hypothesis O
that O
had O
understandably O
puzzled O
the O
workers O
and O
literally O
made O
the O
bondoners O
wince O
, O
who O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
the O
burning O
discovery O
of O
a O
minor O
bondone B-LOC
had O
even O
threatened O
to O
block O
the O
race O
at O
a O
pace O
that O
, O
in O
their O
opinion O
and O
not O
just O
theirs O
, O
would O
honor O
the O
mountain O
they O
loved O
instead O
of O
honouring O
it O
. O

But O
all O
of O
this O
is O
now O
part O
of O
a O
past O
that O
has O
been O
rejected O
by O
the O
present O
. O

And O
Mellarini B-PER
did O
another O
great O
thing O

pink O

not O

, O
but O
on O

remain O

on O
Trento B-LOC
basically O
from O
Tuesday O
to O
Saturday O

In O
the O
middle O
, O
most O
likely O
on O

there O

, O
aside O
from O
the O
canteral O
irony O

it O

going O
to O
be O
really O
a O
great O

in O

the O
provincial O

now O
a O
lot O
of O
speculation O
about O
the O
trajectory O
of O
what O
Rovato B-LOC

Bondone B-LOC
will O
look O
like O
. O

Zomegnan B-PER
did O
n't O
want O
to O
find O
out O
about O
this O
with O
anybody O
else O
, O
but O
he O
had O
three O
different O
hypotheses O
. O

the O
most O
accredited O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
most O
fascinating O
, O
is O
nothing O
more O
than O
the O
climb O
up O
the O
valley O
of O
Valsabbia B-LOC
, O
then O
Bagolino B-LOC
, O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
Trentino B-LOC

the O
final O

The O
other O
hypotheses O
that O
you O
can O
put O
forward O
, O
which O
I O
'm O
going O
to O

by O

we O
put O
in O

to O
find O
out O
which O
way O
to O
go O
, O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
next O

when O

The O

a O

This O

is O
completely O

I O
was O

make O
a O
great O

for O

Giovanazzi B-PER

Bortoli B-PER

back O

even O
Manica B-PER

just O
fine O
now O

This O
is O
also O
weighted O
against O
the O
performance O

Nonetheless O
, O
we O
had O
to O
win O
with O
St. B-ORG

we O
lost O

and O
we O
were O
winning O
against O

we O
got O
there O

Even O
last O
Sunday O
, O
in O
a O
game O
that O
certainly O
was O
n't O
a O
good O
one O
, O
we O
made O
three O

four O

shot O

, O
of O
our O

I O
chose O
to O
be O
able O
to O
play O
without O

I O
could O
send O
out O

After O
three O

this O

what O
explains O
this O
mess O
? O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
big O
crises O
, O
we O
've O
played O
some O
games O
recently O
that O
are O
a O
little O

understated O

these O
are O
things O
that O
happen O

want O
some O

lose O
just O
Sceffer B-PER

who O
was O
still O
an O
important O

for O

to O
think O
that O
we O
were O
a O
high O

class O
team O

Bortoli B-PER
has O
scored O
40 O
goals O
in O
two O
championships O
, O
and O
now O
there O
are O
almost O
four O
dozen O
that O
do O
n't O
play O
, O
because O
even O
yesterday O
-- O
on O
Sunday O
, O
ndr O
-- O
he O
only O
came O
in O
because O
of O
the O
infiltration O

It O
's O
time O
for O
the O
most O
experienced O
players O
, O
even O
if O
the O
oldest O
players O
are O
25 O
, O
to O
take O
on O
their O
responsibilities O
. O

This O
year O
we O
're O
training O
even O
more O
intensively O

the O

finally O

who O
can O
give O
quality O

more O

" O

In O
light O
of O
the O
many O
goals O
that O
have O
been O
scored O
lately O

will O
he O
insist O

three O

will O
he O
be O
more O
cautious O

The O

that O
we O
're O
catching O
too O
many O
nets O
, O
at O
least O
in O
the O
last O
few O
games O
, O
is O
purely O
due O
to O

mistakes O

lots O

two O
scientific O

that O

The O
first O
is O
the O
one O
that O
has O
brought O
microchips O
into O
our O
everyday O
lives O
, O
and O
the O
second O
is O
the O
one O
that O

allowed O
us O
to O
capture O
the O
secrets O
of O
the O
human O

. O

It O
can O
be O
summarized O
, O
in O
the O
words O
of O
Giuseppe B-PER
Dalla I-PER
Porta I-PER
, O
Scientific O
Director O
of O
Ifom B-ORG
, O
the O
importance O
of O
yesterday O

agreement O
between O
his O
cutting O
- O
edge O
cancer O
research O
institute O
and O
Itc B-ORG
- I-ORG
Irst I-ORG
. O

A O
partnership O
that O
will O
see O
bioinformatics O
and O
genomics O
come O
together O
on O
the O
path O
of O
better O
understanding O
the O
onset O
of O
disease O
and O
developing O
increasingly O
individualized O
therapies O
, O
based O
on O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
genetic O
heritage O
of O
each O
patient O
. O

The O
software O
developed O
by O
the O
Bioinformatics O
team O
at O
Povo O
's O
Center B-ORG
for I-ORG
Scientific I-ORG
and I-ORG
Technological I-ORG
Research I-ORG
, O
was O
selected O
among O
hundreds O
by O
Ifom B-ORG
, O
the O
Institute O
of O
Molecular B-ORG
Oncology I-ORG
, O
the O
Italian B-ORG
Cancer I-ORG
Research I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
. O

It O
's O
a O
software O
that O
's O
specifically O
designed O
to O
handle O
the O
mass O
of O
information O
generated O
by O
an O
observation O
technique O
called O
tissue O
microarray O
, O
which O
allows O
researchers O
to O
analyze O
hundreds O
of O
samples O
of O
organic O
tissue O
, O
arranged O
in O
grid O
on O
a O
microscope O
slide O
. O

This O
method O
of O
study O
makes O
it O
easier O
to O
compare O
on O
a O
large O
scale O
the O
efficacy O
and O
effectiveness O
of O
treatments O
, O
saving O
costs O
, O
tissue O
and O
time O
compared O
to O
the O
traditional O
methods O
used O
in O
the O
laboratory O
. O

So O
it O
improves O
the O
efficiency O
of O
biomedical O
research O
, O
including O
cancer O
research O
, O
but O
requires O
complex O
systems O
for O
managing O
and O
transmitting O
the O
data O
that O
's O
collected O
. O

And O
that O
's O
what O
the O
Irst B-ORG
researchers O
have O
been O
working O
on O
for O
the O
last O
five O
years O
, O
supported O
by O

he O
bought O
the O

a O
few O
days O
before O

which O
, O
according O
to O
investigators O
, O
could O
move O
the O
man O

charge O

premeditated O
murder O
forward O
. O

Underlying O
the O
rape O
was O
, O
according O
to O
statements O
released O
by O
the O
man O
, O
his O
misunderstanding O
of O
his O
mother O

, O
most O

, O
the O
woman O

invasion O

, O
marked O
in O
this O

period O

To O
date O
, O
the O
autopsy O

On O
the O
man O
, O
the O
Caprino B-LOC
Veronese I-LOC
Carabinieri O

coordinated O
by O
P.M. O
Zanetelli B-PER
, O
had O
been O
raising O
the O
suspicions O
all O
through O
the O
morning O
. O

It O
was O
Furini B-PER
himself O
who O
called O
the O
military O
and O
told O
them O
that O
he O
had O
found O
the O
mother O
's O
body O
in O
the O
hallway O
from O
the O
bedroom O
. O

The O
house O

in O
order O
, O
nothing O
was O
missing O
, O
and O
there O
were O
no O

So O
the O
victim O
had O
to O
get O
her O
killer O

The O
woman O

house O
is O

He O
was O
stopped O
by O
the O
local O

because O
he O
had O
made O
the O
crossing O
despite O
the O
red O
light O

But O
he O
was O
also O
fined O
for O
not O
wearing O
his O

and O
his O

The O
50 O

- O
old O
driver O

was O
driving O
down O

Paul O

The O

. O

passing O
through O
with O
red O
, O
which O
is O
less O
than O
six O
points O
on O
the O
patent O
. O

When O
the O
man O
met O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
, O
the O
officer O
could O
n't O
help O
but O
notice O
another O
anomaly O
: O

driving O
without O
a O
seat O
belt O
, O
which O
is O
less O
than O
five O
points O
on O

To O
finish O
the O
job O
, O
the O
car O
was O
also O
a O
little O
bit O
brighter O
, O
as O
you O
could O
tell O
from O
the O
way O
it O
was O
going O
in O
the O
middle O
first O
, O
and O
then O
from O
the O
lens O
. O

He O
was O
tested O
for O
alcohol O

and O
he O
was O
positive O

He O
got O
his O

10 O

and O
he O
was O
also O
sued O

being O
a O

So O
for O
a O

the O
man O
will O
no O

be O
able O
to O
cycle O
around O
in O
his O

to O

the O

he O
'll O
have O

he O
'll O
have O

Of O

The O

notified O

Official O
motivation O

protection O

it O

In O

I O

always O

I O
've O
never O
had O
anything O

The O
Army B-ORG
wants O
to O
stop O
my O

it O
wo O
n't O
, O
because O
there O

no O
obstacle O

true O

" O

The O
cavalry O
is O
clean O
, O
but O
it O
's O
been O
serving O
in O

Her O
wounds O
started O

" O
In O
June O
, O
I O
separated O
from O
my O
ex O

wife O
and O
met O
my O
current O
partner O
. O

In O
July O
, O
things O
started O
to O
go O
wrong O
. O

An O
ex O
- O
boyfriend O
of O
mine O
who O
runs O
a O
bar O
in O
Cles B-LOC
began O
to O
threaten O
to O
move O
me O
. O

He O
said O
he O
knew O
about O
the O
Army B-ORG

he O
would O
pay O
me O
for O
it O
. O

He O
also O
threatened O
me O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
there O
's O
a O
process O
going O
on O
with O
him O
before O
the O
Justice O
of O
Peace O
in O
Cles B-LOC

This O
person O
also O
agreed O
to O
call O
my O
ex O

wife O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
I O
was O
dating O
the O
ex O
- O
wife O
of O
a O
former O
judge O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
put O
too O
much O
emphasis O
on O
it O
, O
but O
then O
in O
November O
, O
I O
received O
the O
notice O
from O
the O
Regional O
Command O
that O
the O
transfer O
had O
begun O
. O

I O
was O
very O
surprised O

amazed O
by O
this O
news O

I O
asked O
for O
explanations O
, O
and O
they O
told O
me O
that O
there O
was O
an O
anonymous O
exhibitor O
reporting O
my O
relationship O
with O
my O
current O
girlfriend O
. O

The O
transfer O
was O
justified O
by O
protecting O
my O
innocence O
. O

It O
's O
as O
if O
my O
roommate O
's O
ex O
- O
boyfriend O
could O
hurt O
me O
. O

I O
explained O
that O
he O
's O
in O
jail O
, O
all O
over O
Italy B-LOC
, O
and O
he O
has O
no O
intention O
of O
swimming O
with O
me O
. O

What O
he O
's O
interested O
in O
is O
that O
her O
ex O
and O
the O
two O
children O
she O
's O
had O
are O
fine O
. O

And O
they O
're O
fine O
with O
me O

The O
trucker O
's O
explanations O
, O
however O
, O
did O
n't O
work O
, O
and O
the O
regional O
command O
transferred O
him O
on O
December O
6th O
, O
last O
year O
. O

The O
officer O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
but O
veto O
the O
measure O
through O
lawyer O
Claudio B-PER
Tasin I-PER
. O

Yesterday O
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
train O
depot B-ORG
, O
he O
was O
discussing O
his O
application O
for O
suspension O
. O

The O
first O
meetings O
are O
held O
today O
. O

The O
captain O
is O
still O
convinced O
that O
his O
innocence O
is O
not O
the O
real O
reason O
for O
the O
transfer O
. O

" O
They O
say O
they O
're O
in O
danger O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
but O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
if O
it O
's O
true O
, O
would O
be O
true O
for O
the O
highlands B-LOC
as O
well O
. O

If O
you O
wanted O
to O
hurt O
me O
, O
you O
could O
do O
it O
to O
Lavis B-LOC
as O
well O
as O
to O
San B-LOC
Candido I-LOC
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
the O
Army B-ORG
wants O
to O
boycott O
my O
love O
story O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
understand O
it O
a O
thousand O
times O
, O
but O
I O
could O
n't O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
my O
relationship O
is O
that O
well O
- O
regarded O
because O
my O
past O
partner O
was O
living O
with O
a O
pre O
- O
daughter O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
them O
were O
n't O
married O
. O

They O
have O
no O
legal O
connection O
. O

What O
hurts O
me O
the O
most O
is O
that O
the O
Army B-ORG
, O
which O
represents O
a O
lot O
to O
me O
, O
listens O
more O
to O
an O
anonymous O
exhibitor O
than O
to O
my O
reasons O
and O
my O
explanations O
. O

They O
want O
to O
stop O
my O
love O
story O
, O
but O
they O
wo O
n't O
. O

I O
've O
always O
acted O
well O
and O
did O
n't O
break O
any O
norms O

Behavior O

mirrored O

My O

no O

record O
and O
has O
never O
been O
involved O
in O
any O
of O
her O
ex O

So O
I O
do O

really O
know O
how O
to O
explain O
this O
rise O

our O
level O

up O

Magna O

certainly O
not O
a O
way O
of O
dealing O
with O
the O
local O
powers O
in O
this O

It O
's O
just O
an O
ancient O
tradition O

that O
can O
still O
find O
some O
resonance O
, O
both O
within O

Judge O

did O
the O

right O
in O

use O

This O
has O
been O
a O
long O

cultivated O

And O
that O
, O
over O

, O
has O
remained O
almost O
a O

It O
risks O
continuing O
until O

too O
much O

Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
of O
" O

, O
" O
I O
think O
, O
does O
very O
little O
. O

He O
's O
the O
soul O
of O
the O
D.C. B-ORG
who O
's O
moved O
away O
from O
that O

. O

There O
are O
other O
souls O
in O
that O
party O
and O
in O
the O
provincial O
government O
who O
tend O
to O
keep O
that O
tradition O
alive O
. O

However O
, O
if O
I O
focus O
power O
in O
a O
single O
center O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
clients O
, O
there O
are O
pressures O
at O
the O
lower O
levels O
of O
government O
, O
there O
are O
biases O
. O

Democracy O
is O
about O
bringing O
power O
closer O
to O
the O
citizen O
, O
giving O
them O
greater O
power O
to O
govern O
, O

Bressanini B-PER
, O
she O
studied O
and O
proposed O
an O
institutional O
reform O
that O
would O
have O
some O
effect O
on O
this O
system O
. O

That O
's O
what O
my O
constitutional O
reform O
is O
all O
about O
. O

bring O
the O
center O
of O
real O
power O
closer O
to O
the O
citizens O
, O
avoiding O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
the O
system O
of O
receipts O
and O
returns O
. O

But O
to O
do O
that O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
financial O
flows O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
financial O
flows O
, O
from O
the O
province B-LOC
to O
the O
territorial O
jurisdiction O
, O
by O
law O
, O
without O
political O
mediation O
. O

And O
that O
's O
what O
the O
reform O
is O
foreseeing O
, O
in O
a O
much O
more O
important O
and O
significant O
way O
than O
it O
is O
right O
now O
. O

I O
realize O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
territories O
, O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
spheres O
, O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
ways O
of O
selecting O
certain O
organisms O
. O

But O
the O
important O
conversation O
that O
's O
behind O
that O
is O
the O
exercise O
of O
power O
, O
which O
goes O
to O
the O
territories O
. O

The O
micro O
- O
scale O
communities O
do O
n't O
give O
them O
the O
chance O
to O
really O
exercise O
their O
power O
. O

Instead O
, O
with O
the O
territorial O
scope O
that O
my O
reform O
envisions O
, O
you O
're O
going O
to O
have O
real O
power O
transitions O
from O
what O
is O
now O
the O
absolute O
core O
of O
the O
province B-LOC
. O

Does O
your O
reform O
take O
into O
account O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
establish O
different O
financial O
skills O
? O

Of O

Article O
7 O
contains O
a O
very O
detailed O
list O
, O
which O
sets O
out O
what O
skills O
are O
left O
in O
the O
province B-LOC
and O
what O
are O
transferred O
to O
the O
valley O
communities O
. O

The O
most O
relevant O
ones O
are O
those O
of O
the O
territorial O
organization O
of O
urban O
planning O
-- O
a O
second O
- O
tier O
power O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
has O
to O
respect O
the O
guidelines O
defined O
in O
the O
provincial O
sphere O
. O

But O
also O
the O
territorial O
organization O
of O
community O
development O
programming O
. O

Every O
community O
has O
to O
question O
and O
decide O
where O
they O
want O
to O
go O
and O
how O
they O
want O
to O
get O
there O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
the O
province B-LOC
doing O
it O
. O

The O
province B-LOC
just O
has O
to O
provide O
the O
funding O
. O

Someone O
has O
talked O
about O
the O
rise O
of O
suspicion O
, O
on O
the O
part O
of O
citizens O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
valleys O
, O
about O
the O
so O
- O
called O
tyranny O
of O
profits O
. O
Do O
you O
think O
that O
happened O
in O
the O
last O
elections O
? O

I O
did O
n't O
warn O
him O
about O
this O
rush O
of O
rejection O
. O

I O
think O
, O
like O
in O
the O
past O
, O
many O
30s O
citizens O
voted O
differently O
in O
politics O
than O
they O
did O
in O
the O
presidential O
elections O
. O

The O
left O
, O
for O
example O
, O
always O
got O
more O
votes O
in O
the O
national O
elections O
, O
because O
it O
was O
an O
ideal O
vote O
. O

Whereas O
in O
the O
provinces O
, O
it O
was O
the O
bad O
habit O
of O
the O
citizen O
to O
vote O
by O
convenience O
, O
to O
vote O
with O
the O
hat O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
the O
speech O
of O
that O
mayor O
of O
Fai B-LOC
who O
says O
he O
's O
on O
the O
center O
- O
right O
but O
has O
signed O
up O
to O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
in O
order O
to O
get O
supposed O
advantages O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
province B-LOC
. O

It O
's O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
pity O
that O
mayor O
, O
his O
mindset O
is O
already O
clientelistic O
. O

I O
think O
he O
's O
more O
guilty O
than O
the O
one O
who O
, O
though O
, O
really O
asked O
her O
something O
. O

But O
it O
remains O
, O
nonetheless O
, O
extremely O
misguided O
and O
totally O
undemocratic O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
those O
in O
the O
province B-LOC
who O
say O
they O
want O
to O
raise O
the O
price O
demanded O
of O
the O
councillors O
who O
did O
not O
vote O
well O
. O

It O
's O
possible O
that O
Margherita B-ORG
over O
the O
years O
has O
encouraged O
these O
kinds O
of O
behaviors O
. O

But O
the O
mammals O
do O
n't O
exist O
anymore O
, O
not O
even O
on O
the O
left O
. O

What O
I O
'm O
saying O
is O
that O
the O
attitude O
of O
selling O
to O
power O
, O
of O
not O
feeling O
like O
citizens O
with O
rights O
but O
addicted O
to O
the O
tyranny O
, O
is O
a O
historical O
legacy O
of O
some O
of O
the O
1930s O
. O

Will O
your O
proposed O
institutional O
reform O
be O
able O
to O
live O
up O
to O
this O
tradition O
? O

It O
gives O
the O
territories O
more O
tools O
for O
autonomy O
, O
but O
also O
more O
responsibility O
to O
the O
local O
government O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
though O
, O
my O
aspiration O
is O
to O
increase O
people O
's O
participation O
in O
the O
public O
domain O
. O

Increasing O
the O
citizen O
's O
daily O
relationship O
with O
power O
, O
which O
is O
too O
low O
today O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
create O
a O
new O
class O
of O
managers O
, O
we O
want O
to O
squeeze O
power O
out O
of O
society O
. O

sense O

he O
a O
good O
leader O

Without O
him O
, O

be O
more O
depressed O

Even O
though O
he O
does O

to O
be O
deceived O
by O
this O
, O
and O
most O
importantly O

go O
back O
from O
three O
months O

20 O

" O
I O
'm O
sorry O
for O
these O
parents O
that O
they O
may O
not O
have O
been O
able O
to O
express O
their O
discomfort O
in O
the O
ward O
, O
otherwise O
we O
would O
have O
solved O
it O
, O
within O
the O
limits O
of O
what O
is O
possible O
, O
because O
the O
issue O
of O
physical O
spaces O
in O
pediatrics O
is O
an O
issue O
that O
has O
always O
been O
raised O
by O
me O
, O
and O
more O
recently O
by O
Dr. O
Giannelli B-PER
. O

Certainly O
something O
did O
n't O
work O
in O
terms O
of O
communication O
, O
so O
I O
already O
called O
the O
parents O
of O
Jacob B-PER
. O

I O
want O
to O
see O
them O
and O
talk O
to O
them O
and O
make O
sure O
they O
're O
in O
the O
department O
to O
see O
how O
we O
can O
improve O

about O

during O

For O

Jacob B-PER

in O

not O
equipped O
for O

for O

the O

was O
always O
with O
him O
, O
there O
was O
no O
room O
in O
the O

. O

" O
It O
was O
full O
, O
" O
says O
Dr. O
Di B-PER
Palma I-PER
. O
" O
The O
epidemic O
started O
, O
and O
even O
though O
the O
check O
- O
ups O
were O
as O
short O
as O
possible O
, O
there O
were O
never O
enough O
places O
. O
" O

At O
the O
time O
, O
the O
new O
Santa B-ORG
Chiara I-ORG
pediatric O
building O
was O
a O
big O
innovation O
, O
because O
the O
neonatal O
technology O
with O
the O
toddler O
was O
brought O
on O
the O
same O
footing O
as O
the O
gynecology O
. O

" O
But O
the O
demands O
of O
paediatrics O
have O
changed O
dramatically O
in O
recent O
years O
. O

We O
see O
girls O
between O
the O
ages O
of O
three O
months O
and O
20 O
, O
including O
those O
with O
nervous O
aneurysms O
, O
chronic O
diseases O
, O
Di B-PER
Palma I-PER
says O
. O

We O
do O
a O
very O
low O
number O
of O
visits O
, O
because O
it O
's O
around O
1,200 O
, O
1,300 O
, O
but O
there O
are O
1,500 O
, O
1,700 O
children O
and O
young O
people O
who O
are O
being O
watched O
for O
36 O
hours O
. O

With O
this O
movement O
, O
programming O
in O
24 O
places O
is O
impossible O
, O
especially O
at O
this O
time O
of O
viral O
spread O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
time O
to O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
very O
fast O
and O
very O
pressing O
turn O
- O
over O
. O

The O
nurses O
in O
the O
ward O
, O
though O
, O
are O
heartening O
us O
, O
and O
so O
are O
the O
volunteers O
who O
are O
here O
to O
help O
. O

So O
they O
're O
responding O
to O
the O
feeling O
of O
abandonment O
that O
this O
couple O
described O
in O

're O
responding O
to O
people O

are O
also O

with O
emotions O

not O
just O
time O
with O
their O
time O

Jacopo B-PER

in O

I O
'm O

about O
the O

this O
case O
the O
surgery O
lasted O
a O
little O

longer O

three O

neither O

just O
pointed O
out O

are O
more O
reasons O
for O

autonomous O
presence O
than O
for O

But O
the O
stopping O
of O
the O
unitary O
motion O
-- O
supported O
by O

puts O
a O
brake O
on O

Why O
is O
that O
? O

" O
For O
years O
I O
've O
been O
following O
the O
war O
in O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
and O
I O
've O
been O
deeply O
disturbed O
by O
the O
violence O
. O

There O
, O
as O
in O
so O
many O
other O
places O
in O
the O
world O
-- O
and O
unfortunately O
, O
as O
is O
happening O
now O
between O
Israel B-LOC
and O
Palestine B-LOC
-- O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
only O
way O
to O
resolve O
conflict O
was O
through O
conflict O
. O

Even O
though O
those O
areas O
attracted O
me O
, O
there O
was O
always O
something O
about O
them O
that O
kept O
me O
from O
actually O
going O
there O
. O

It O
was O
as O
if O
all O
the O
hatred O
and O
rage O
, O
the O
inability O
to O
relate O
to O
others O
except O
with O
weapons O
and O
shrewdness O
, O
were O
keeping O
me O
away O
. O
" O

Was O
it O
a O
tough O
journey O
? O

" O
We O
started O
in O
four O
cars O
and O
no O
driver O
, O
but O
one O
of O
us O
had O
been O
to O
those O
areas O
before O
, O
riding O
a O
bicycle O
with O
an O
organized O
tour O
of O
the B-ORG

In O
addition O
, O
the O
association O
had O
prepared O
the O
ground O
for O
us O
anyway O
, O
and O
they O
had O
booked O
us O
lodgings O
and O
local O
guides O
, O
which O
, O
when O
you O
travel O
to O
these O
countries O
in O
this O
way O
, O
is O
very O
valuable O
. O

Everything O
went O
well O
anyway O
. O

We O
were O
housed O
in O
a O
family O
, O
and O
we O
were O
exposed O
to O
local O
realities O
, O
and O
we O
lived O
with O
the O
families O
and O
listened O
to O
their O
stories O
. O

We O
've O
seen O
so O
many O
countries O
rebuilt O
, O
but O
also O
so O
many O
needs O
and O
needs O
that O
are O
n't O
being O
addressed O
yet O
. O

And O
there O
's O
an O
effort O
everywhere O
to O
get O
back O
to O
normal O
, O
even O
though O
the O
injuries O
are O
still O
there O
and O
it O
will O
take O
time O
for O
them O
to O
heal O
. O

It O
's O
certainly O
been O
an O
experience O
that O
has O
enriched O
us O
and O
left O
us O
with O
precious O
memories O
. O
" O

Among O
the O
materials O
collected O
by O
Giovanna B-PER
, O
there O
are O
surprising O
illustrations O
of O
places O
, O
like O
the O
Put O

Trail O
, O
a O
route O
through O
central O
Serbia O
that O
spans O
monasteries O
, O
castles O
and O
spas O
, O
passing O
rivers O
and O
streams O
that O
intertwine O
and O
bathe O
the O
landscape O
. O

And O
one O
wonders O
why O
so O
many O
of O
us O
feel O
more O
at O
home O
in O
some O
unlikely O
and O
invented O
place O
like O
Sharm B-LOC
el I-LOC
Sheikh I-LOC
than O
ever O
before O
, O
and O
never O
thought O
about O
putting O
our O
noses O
down O
two O
steps O
away O
from O
home O
in O
these O
charming O
places O
rich O
in O
art O
, O
nature O
and O
history O
. O

History O
that O
so O
often O
-- O
and O
even O
recently O
-- O
has O
touched O
us O
very O
, O
very O
closely O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
there O
's O
always O
someone O
out O
of O
the O
choir O
. O

Because O
the O
real O
discovery O
is O
not O
in O
finding O
new O
lands O
, O
it O
's O
in O
looking O
with O
new O

bury O
the O
report O
, O
which O
had O
never O
happened O

, O
with O

highest O

That O

to O

, O
almost O
broken O
, O

whose O
references O
seemed O

a O

Rizzoli B-PER

how O
the O

become O
a O
taboo O
, O
even O
in O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
governor O
and O
the O
president O
. O

" O
President O
Dellai B-PER
could O
not O
fail O
to O
address O
the O
issue O
of O
irrigation O
, O
which O
is O
also O
at O
the O
center O
of O
attention O
, O
albeit O
more O
discreetly O
addressed O
by O
the O
Archbishop O
Bressan B-PER
. O

It O
's O
almost O
a O
more O
sensitive O
issue O
, O
a O
more O
politically O
weighted O
one O
, O
with O
so O
little O
willingness O
to O
make O
real O
comparisons O
. O

Even O
among O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
local O
Church B-ORG
, O
in O
fact O
, O
they O
have O
the O
courage O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

It O
would O
almost O
seem O
that O
it O
should O
remain O
a O
taboo O
, O
even O
though O
many O
religious O
people O
feel O
the O
need O
for O
greater O
coherence O
and O
presence O
on O
social O
issues O
on O
which O
the O
Catholic O
base O
is O
actually O
much O
more O
sensitive O
and O
vigilant O
than O
they O
believe O
. O

In O
his O
speech O
, O
the O
President O
recalled O
some O
of O
the O
challenges O
. O

He O
writes O
that O
" O
governing O
means O
taking O
all O
positions O
into O
account O
, O
comparing O
with O
all O
others O
, O
" O
while O
he O
continues O
to O
reject O
the O
notion O
of O
a O
fair O
comparison O
with O
the O
opponents O
of O
his O
proposed O
landfill O
. O

Whereas O
it O
does O
n't O
allow O
for O
a O
single O
comparison O
-- O
contradictory O
, O
even O
with O
those O
local O
communities O
that O
, O
right O
now O
, O
are O
demanding O
it O
out O
loud O
. O

His O
partner O
in O
the O
party O
, O
counselor O
Silvano B-PER
Grisenti I-PER
, O
imposes O
strictly O
separate O
meetings O
on O
his O
employees O

recent O

Faedo B-LOC
and O

and O
next O
January O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
ethics O
of O
behavior O
, O
any O
government O
official O
or O
employee O
, O
or O
representative O
of O
a O
class O
of O
organization O
, O
is O
scrupulously O
rejecting O
and O
denying O
any O
evidence O
of O
a O
single O
- O
sided O
skepticism O
about O
the O
landfill O
project O
. O

Does O
n't O
it O
seem O
strange O
to O
him O
that O
having O
invited O
him O
here O
to O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
panelists O
with O
proven O
expertise O
, O
and O
not O
yet O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
have O
a O
conversation O
, O
does O
it O
really O
sound O
like O
the O
paradox O
of O
the O
selfishness O
of O
autonomy O
, O
of O
the O
selfishness O
of O
thinking O
? O

For O
the O
president O
, O
it O
's O
ethical O
to O
just O
" O
take O
it O
back O
" O
and O
to O
silence O
anyone O
who O
doubts O

speaks O
ill O

now O
know O
what O

behind O
this O
ugly O
page O
of O
30s O

, O
far O
beyond O
the O
sense O
of O
responsibility O
that O
he O

brought O
, O
increasingly O
tiredly O

to O
bear O

President O
Dellai B-PER
still O
feels O
the O

to O
" O

the O
criticism O
that O
he O
would O

choose O

" O

He O
claims O
that O
" O
it O

it O
's O

the O
fact O
that O
the O

be O
a O

" O

It O
's O
a O

becoming O
increasingly O
important O
for O

example O

very O
high O

already O

to O
document O
the O
most O
important O
cases O

The O
novelty O
of O
the O
system O
is O
that O
we O
can O
accurately O
and O
three O
- O
dimensionally O
document O
a O
crime O
scene O

The O
very O
high O

resolution O
camera O

over O
55 O

allows O
you O

and O
you O
can O
also O
do O
any O

" O
In O
a O
short O
time O

" O

" O
the O
system O
can O
completely O
capture O

Among O
the O
advantages O

the O

system O
is O
the O
accurate O
re O

vision O
of O

third O
standing I-ORG
committee I-ORG
, O
chaired O
by O
Roberto B-PER
Pinter I-PER

So O
he O
ended O
up O
, O
with O
a O
slap O
in O
the O
face O
, O
commissioning O
the O
three O
texts O

presented O

Pinter B-PER
argued O
that O
, O
with O
nine O
amendments O
to O
the O
bill O
, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
" O
contain O
" O
the O

, O
effectively O
investing O
the O
matter O
in O
the O
provincial B-ORG

, O
but O
rejecting O
President O
Dellai B-PER

accusation O

" O
begging O

" O

The O
reaction O
of O
the O
opposition O
, O
especially O
of O
Giovanazzi B-PER
, O
who O
accuses O
the O
Trentino B-LOC
governor O
, O
" O
shaken O
" O
by O
his O
own O
majority O
, O
of O
being O
weak O
, O
of O
having O
some O
absences O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

President O
Dellai B-PER
of O
another O
country O
intends O
to O
stick O
, O
and O
he O
has O
already O
stated O
that O
he O
will O
present O
the O
original O
text O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
" O
because O
it O
responds O
to O
the O
need O
to O
clarify O
the O
legislative O
framework O
in O
which O
the O
hunt O
is O
conducted O
, O
in O
light O
of O
the O
recent O
ruling O
of O
the O
Constitutional B-ORG
Court I-ORG
, O
by O
aligning O
provincial O
legislation O
with O
national O
legislation O
. O
" O

All O
three O
billboards O
will O
arrive O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
and O
the O
radically O
altered O
text O
of O
the O
gang B-ORG
will O
have O
to O
be O
restored O
. O

" O
But O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
there O
is O
room O
for O
some O
discussion O
, O
" O
says O
Pinter B-PER
, O
" O
with O
some O
indication O
of O
a O
minor O
conflict O
between O
those O
who O
want O
to O
see O
the O
use O
of O
venom O
overwhelmingly O
and O
those O
who O
are O
against O
hunting O
. O
" O

Three O
questions O
that O
Pinter B-PER
hopes O
we O
can O
address O
: O

respect O
for O
Sunday O
as O
a O
day O
of O
venatory O
silence O
, O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
old O
ungulate O
hunting O
system O
from O
September O
1 O
, O
excluding O
summer O
time O
, O
and O
the O
elimination O
of O
the O
15 O
days O
of O
August O
for O
domesticated O
camels O
hunting O
. O

" O
Sunday O
as O
a O
day O
of O
vengeful O
silence O
is O
an O
old O
ball O
of O
mine O
all O
the O
time O
, O
and O
on O
holidays O
the O
mountain O
is O
more O
crowded O
and O
there O
's O
more O
people O
in O
the O
woods O
, O
" O
says O
Pinter B-PER
. O

The O
second O
is O
: O

The O
rule O
is O
that O
hunting O
days O
are O
three O
out O
of O
five O
, O
but O
at O
the O
hunter O
's O
discretion O
, O
which O
ultimately O
leads O
to O
five O
. O

I O
said O
no O
, O
that O
days O
are O
actually O
three O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
've O
been O
told O
that O
it O
's O
hunted O
seven O
days O
out O
of O
every O
seven O
days O
in O
the O
High B-LOC
Arctic O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
see O
why O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
better O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

I O
'm O
starting O
from O
the O
principle O
that O
, O
while O
we O
're O
still O
harvesting O
, O
in O
a O
few O
days O
we O
'll O
all O
be O
better O
off O
, O
because O
there O
's O
a O
convergence O
of O
presence O
that O
's O
not O
only O
a O
danger O
, O
but O
it O
's O
also O
a O
problem O
of O
tranquility O
for O
the O
animals O
and O
for O
nature O
. O
" O

The O
third O
issue O
raised O
by O
Pinter B-PER
, O
and O
removed O
from O
the O
text O
of O
the O
amendment O
, O
is O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
old O
calendar O
of O
slaughter O
, O
with O
the O
slaughter O
of O
ungulates O
allowed O
even O
during O
the O
period O
from O
1 O
May O
to O
30 O
June O
. O

" O
It O
's O
clear O
that O
this O
was O
the O
main O
content O
of O
the O
law O
, O
" O
Pinter B-PER
continues O
, O
" O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
long O
to O
get O
it O
right O
. O

And O
by O
the O
way O
, O
some O
of O
the O
hunter O
- O
gatherer O
representatives O
also O
expressed O
some O
confusion O
about O
this O
period O
, O
which O
is O
when O
the O
youngest O
cubs O
are O
in O
circulation O
. O
" O

The O
Pinter B-PER
Amendment O
repealed O
this O
possibility O
, O
reintroduced O
it O
into O
national O
legislation O
and O
challenged O
it O
by O
animal O
scientists O
. O

With O
God O
's O
blessing O
and O
with O
Cheetahs B-PER
, O
Pinter B-PER
honored O
his O
vote O
, O
which O
equally O
weighs O
twice O
as O
much O
, O
and O
with O
Bombard B-PER
's O
vote O
, O
and O
on O
Sunday O
's O
vote O
, O
with O
Carli B-PER
's O
vote O
, O
he O
swept O
away O
the O
text O
presented O
by O
the O
jury B-ORG
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
law O
has O
been O
rejected O
, O
but O
it O
's O
going O
to O
go O
into O
the O
classroom O
with O
the O
amended O
text O
, O
forcing O
the O
majority O
to O
proceed O
with O
the O
amendments O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
not O
deluding O
myself O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
pretending O
that O
from O
night O
to O
morning O
hunting O
disappears O
, O
" O
concludes O
Pinter B-PER
, O
" O
but O
that O
some O
forms O
of O
distraction O
towards O
tourism O
and O
those O
who O
go O
out O
into O
the O
woods O
may O
be O

why O

The O

out O

the O
contrary O

The O

We O
do O

That O

why O
we O
asked O

" O

The O
maximum O

at O

with O
nostalgia O

One O
particular O
fact O
that O

ROMA B-LOC
-- O
With O
the O
devolution O
, O
the O
government O
has O
completed O
the O
12 O
tables O
in O
our O
program O
: O
there O
's O
only O
fiscal O
reform O
missing O
, O
but O
at O
this O
point O
we O
're O
in O
trouble O
because O
of O
the O
hole O
we O
've O
found O
, O
and O
we O
'll O
see O
in O
Finance O
if O
we O
can O
get O
some O
clues O
. O

With O
these O
words O
, O
they O
say O
, O
Berlusconi B-PER
would O
have O
concluded O
the O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
, O
thereby O
expressing O
his O
gratitude O
that O
he O
had O
successfully O
overcome O
even O
the O
scourge O
of O
federal O
reform O
. O

A O
very O
uncomfortable O
outcome O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
council B-ORG
meeting O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
according O
to O
what O
they O
learned O
, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
different O
times O
of O
tension O
for O
the O
verbal O
clash O
between O
ministers O
. O

But O
devolution O
would O
n't O
have O
warmed O
the O
hearts O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
first O
lively O
debate O
would O
have O
been O
for O
ratification O
of O
the O
Treaty O
of O
Nice B-LOC
. O

The O
minister O
for O
reforms O
, O
Umberto B-PER
Bossi I-PER
, O
would O
have O
spoken O
out O
against O
it O
, O
calling O
this O
treaty O
" O
undemocratic O
. O
" O

Other O
ministers O
would O
have O
pointed O
out O
to O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Railway B-ORG
that O
the O
passage O
to O
the O
Houses O
of O
such O
an O
important O
text O
for O
the O
European B-LOC
Union I-LOC
is O
" O
an O
act O
of O
obedience O
. O
" O

In O
positions O
close O
to O
Bossi B-PER
's O
, O
though O
with O
some O
distinctions O
, O
would O
have O
been O
Julius B-PER
Tremonti I-PER
and O
Antonio B-PER
Martino I-PER
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
Minister O
for O
Community O
Policy O
, O
Rocco B-PER
Buttiglione I-PER
, O
would O
have O
raised O
his O
voice O
strongly O
, O
arguing O
that O
European O
commitment O
is O
part O
of O
the O
government O
's O
agenda O
at O
least O
as O
much O
as O
devolution O
. O

Berlusconi B-PER
would O
not O
have O
intervened O
in O
the O
discussion O
, O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
an O
intervention O
by O
Foreign O
Minister O
Renato B-PER
Ruggiero I-PER
to O
persuade O
Bossi B-PER
to O
give O
up O
. O

The O
second O
proposal O
that O
sparked O
a O
lively O
debate O
was O
the O
proposed O
constitutional O
reform O
put O
forward O
by O
Opportunities O
Minister O
Stefania B-PER
Prestigiacomo I-PER
, O
aimed O
at O
amending O
Article O
51 O
to O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
women O
to O
stand O
in O
elections O
. O

Even O
in O
this O
case O
, O
Bossi B-PER
would O
have O
protested O
vigorously O
. O

Bossi B-PER
would O
have O
pointed O
out O
that O
, O
being O
the O
Minister O
of O
Reform O
, O
any O
proposed O
amendments O
to O
the O
Constitution O
would O
have O
to O
be O
subject O
to O
his O
scrutiny O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
the O
one O
who O
's O
proposing O
reforms O
in O
this O
government O
, O
" O
he O
'd O
ask O
irritatedly O
. O
" O
Is O
n't O
that O
right O
? O
" O

" O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
League B-ORG
would O
get O
more O
consensus O
, O
making O
it O
necessary O
to O
test O
the O
merits O
of O
the O
proposal O
. O

Many O
people O
would O
argue O
that O
talking O
about O
" O
equality O
of O
access O
" O
would O
rediscover O
the O
thorny O
issue O
of O
quotas O
. O

If O
you O
start O
with O
women O
, O
it O
would O
be O
observed O
, O
and O
then O
you O
could O
establish O
a O
number O
of O
places O
for O
linguistic O
minorities O
, O
ethnic O
minorities O
and O
other O
particular O
communities O
. O

So O
the O
solution O
is O
to O
put O
the O
less O
challenging O
expression O
" O
equal O
opportunity O
" O
in O
Article O
51 O
. O

Devolution O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
strong O
dish O
of O
the O
day O
, O
would O
have O
been O
the O
point O
with O
the O
least O
friction O
. O

Supported O
by O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
framework O
law O
to O
accompany O
constitutional O
reform O
, O
an O
amendment O
to O
the O
text O
of O
the O
reform O
by O
Bossi B-PER
himself O
was O
welcomed O
, O
in O
which O
he O
stated O
that O
devolution O
must O
have O
as O
its O
limits O
the O
guarantee O
of O
constitutional O
rights O
and O
duties O
and O
constitutional O
laws O
. O

There O
would O
be O
a O
walkable O
path O
. O

Today O
's O
amendment O
is O
Article O
117 O
alone O
, O
introducing O
the O
exclusive O
competence O
of O
the O
Regions O
on O
schooling O
, O
health O
and O
local O
safety O
. O

In O
a O
second O
phase O
, O
it O
will O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
revision O
of O
Article O
119 O
, O
which O
governs O
the O
transfer O
of O
resources O
, O
and O
the O
new O
procedures O
for O
the O
election O
of O
members O
of O
the O
Constitutional B-ORG
Court I-ORG
. O

The O
Council B-ORG
also O
specified O
that O
October O
7th O
would O
be O
the O
date O
for O
the O
federalist O
referendum O
to O
take O
place O
. O

So O
on O
devolution O
, O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Ministers I-ORG
reached O
a O
" O
full O
political O
agreement O
" O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
devolution O
, O
the O
broad O
lines O
of O
reform O
were O
" O
unanimously O
approved O
. O
" O

But O
the O
text O
of O
the O
bill O
will O
be O
formalized O
and O
approved O
by O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Ministers I-ORG
right O
after O
the O
referendum O
. O

A O
general O
agreement O
has O
been O
reached O
. O

said O
Umberto B-PER
Bossi I-PER
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
. O

So O
the O
minister O
of O
reform O
said O
that O
all O
the O
bills O
" O
will O
be O
in O
place O
" O
by O
September O
. O

until B-PER
he O
had O
the O
" O
guarantees O
" O
he O
was O
asking O
for O
. O

Bossi B-PER
described O
it O
as O
" O
great O
satisfaction O
" O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
" O
on O
everything O
and O
with O
everyone O
. O
" O

The O
Minister O
for O
Reform O
has O
pointed O
out O
that O
there O
are O
still O
some O
pieces O
missing O
, O
like O
the O
Constitutional B-ORG
Court I-ORG
part O
, O
but O
he O
has O
announced O
that O
there O
will O
be O
regionally O
- O
elected O
components O
of O
the O
Consultation B-ORG
. O

" O
We O
've O
discussed O
today O
Art O

117 O
, O
" O
he O
explained O
, O
" O
which O
is O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
problem O
. O
" O

Bossi B-PER
also O
explained O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O
flat O
law O
. O

As O
for O
the O
positions O
of O
Gianfranco B-PER
Fini I-PER
Bossi B-PER
, O
he O
explained O
that O
" O
the O
square O
has O
been O
found O
. O
" O

" O
You O
have O
to O
have O
real O
patience O
, O
" O
Bossi B-PER
said O
. O
" O
Fini B-PER
wanted O
guarantees O
that O
were O
widely O
given O
. O

From O
here O
to O
the O
referendum O
, O
everything O
will O
be O
fine O
. O
" O

" O
The O
final O
fixing O
of O
the O
date O
of O
the O

enables O
us O
to O
complete O
the O
iteration O
of O

Creating O

The O

Saddam B-PER

It O

not O

And O
then O
? O

If O

how O
will O

react O

Bush B-PER

by O

Maybe O
that O

where O
the O
thought O
that O
you O
did O

have O
after O
9/11 O
comes O
in O

U.S. O
public O
opinion O
at O
that O
point O

question O
whether O

really O
the O
most O
appropriate O

of O

In O
America B-LOC

today O

who O
can O
react O
to O
elections O
differently O
than O
the O
Bush B-PER
administration O
would O
have O
expected O
. O

Let O
's O
remember O
that O
the O
election O
of O
the O
president O
took O
place O
in O
a O
country O
that O
was O
cut O
in O
half O
, O
that O
had O
strong O
opposition O
to O
war O
within O
it O
, O
that O
saw O
Americans O
until O
the O
very O
last O
moment O
favour O
a O
second O
resolution O
of O
the O
U.S. O
conflict O
. O
" O

But O
Iraq B-LOC
has O
shown O
that O
, O
put O
it O
all O
together O
, O
making O
a O
war O
for O
the O
world O
's O
most O
powerful O
military O
is O
easy O
and O
quick O
. O

In O
less O
than O
a O
month O
, O
they O
had O
taken O
over O
Saddam B-PER

buildings O
. O

Of O
the O
300,000 O
men O
employed O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
just O
a O
handful O

mostly O
for O

Could O
n't O
that O

many O
people O

make O
them O
believe O
that O

could O
be O
the O
ordinary O

" O
No O

figures O

Rumsfeld B-PER

number O
one O

there O

the O
idea O

It O

that O

you O
do O

then O
we O

coming O
from O
you O

The O
reality O

that O
simple O

Americans O
have O
been O
very O
good O
at O

all O

if O

And O
this O
will O
force O
us O
to O
rethink O
the O
role O
of O
international O
organizations O
, O
of O
Europe B-LOC
, O
of O
multilateral O
alliances O
, O
of O
the O
indiscriminate O
use O
of O
weapons O
. O
" O

Meanwhile O
, O
relations O
between O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
Europe B-LOC
are O
at O
a O
standstill O
. O

The O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
no O
longer O
has O
a O
role O
. O

NATO B-ORG
is O
at O
the O
forefront O
. O

any O
hypotheses O
of O
multilateral O
alliances O
have O
disappeared O
. O

Rebuilding O
this O
network O
of O
relationships O
and O
institutions O
is O
not O
going O
to O
be O
easy O
. O

For O
a O
united B-LOC
Europe I-LOC
, O
this O
is O
an O
unprecedented O
mess O
. O

" O
If O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
continues O
to O
think O
of O
itself O
in O
managing O
the O
post O
- O
war O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
without O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
and O
without O
the O
U.S. O
, O
we O
will O
see O
the O
opposite O
of O
a O
Europe B-LOC
- O
wide O
payoff O
. O

The O
Eight O
European O
countries O
, O
the O
U.S. O
, O
will O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
support O
an O
atheistic O
position O
alongside O
the O
United O
States B-LOC
. O

Blair B-PER
himself O
would O
be O
in O
deep O
trouble O
. O

If O
the O
post O
- O
war O
management O
, O
as O
analysts O
predict O
, O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
broad O
and O
risky O
, O
then O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
itself O
would O
be O
standing O
up O
in O
front O
of O
the O
United O
Nations O
and O
asking O
the O
international O
community O
to O
move O
forward O
. O

If O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
we O
were O
to O
see O
a O
victorious O
U.S. B-LOC
administration O
even O
after O
the O
war O
, O
then O
indeed O
, O
Europe B-LOC
would O
find O
itself O
severely O
weakened O
, O
and O
international O
institutions O
at O
the O
forefront O
. O

But O
I O
think O
that O
's O
the O
least O
likely O
scenario O
. O
" O

It O
's O
just O
that O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
has O
shown O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
it O
's O
an O
incredibly O
powerful O
military O
force O
, O
capable O
of O
waging O
war O
on O
its O
own O
when O
it O
wants O
to O
, O
against O
whom O
it O
wants O
to O
, O
without O
anyone O
else O
having O
to O
fight O
it O
, O
and O
at O
a O
human O
cost O
all O
of O
the O
content O
comes O
from O
technology O
. O

This O
is O
not O
going O
to O
go O
unnoticed O
globally O
, O
affecting O
our O
relationship O
with O
Europe B-LOC
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
's O
democracies O
as O
well O
. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
Americans O
themselves O
have O
been O
amazed O
by O
the O
enormous O
and O
terrifying O
military O
power O
they O
have O
. O

Such O
a O
strong O
superpower O
is O
very O
dangerous O
. O

It O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
's O
a O
democracy O
and O
it O
has O
a O
public O
opinion O
to O
respond O
to O
. O

But O
it O
's O
not O
reassuring O
. O

Not O
just O
for O
the O
use O
that O
could O
be O
made O
of O
military O
potential O
. O

But O
also O
for O
the O
reactions O
that O
it O
can O
have O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

If O
you O
know O
you O
're O
in O
the O
bombsight O
, O
you O
're O
going O
to O
say O
, O

I O
have O
nothing O
to O
lose O
, O
and O
it O
's O
going O
to O
cause O
unthinkable O
reactions O
. O

That O
's O
what O
the O
kamikazes O
and O
the O
fijians O
do O
. O

You O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
despair O
of O
those O
who O
know O
you O
're O
losing O

That O

why O
I O
rely O

In O
an O
interview O
with O
Foglio B-ORG
that O
anticipated O
it O
, O
Berlusconi B-PER
actually O
said O
, O
" O
Referendums O
can O
be O
held O
next O
year O
, O

do O

them O

goes O
on O

, O

the O
country O
deceived O
me O
. O

When O
a O
democratic O
country O
defies O
government O
-- O
Berlusconi B-PER
explained O
-- O
it O
does O
so O
after O
free O
elections O
. O

We O
have O
an O
inescapable O
position O
. O

It O
seems O
obvious O
to O
us O
-- O
he O
said O
-- O
that O
the O
country O
has O
a O
clear O
, O
clear O
problem O
of O
political O
neglect O
. O

New O
elections O
are O
the O
only O
way O
to O
re O
- O
establish O
the O
virtuous O
circle O
between O
the O
real O
country O
and O
the O
legal O
country O
. O
Let O
's O
say O
that O
-- O
he O
insisted O
-- O
because O
we O
are O
convinced O
of O
it O
, O
without O
hesitation O
. O

We O
have O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
issues O
that O
the O
head O
of O
state O
has O
to O
solve O
, O
and O
we O
know O
that O
he O
's O
the O
arbiter O
of O
the O
times O
and O
the O
ways O
of O
solving O
the O
crisis O
, O
but O
if O
it O
's O
the O
opinion O
of O
those O
who O
, O
in O
successive O
elections O
, O
have O
been O
given O
a O
broad O
political O
mandate O
by O
the O
people O
of O
the O
kingdom O
, O
that O
opinion O
is O
that O
you O
should O
n't O
mess O
with O
it O
. O
" O

The O
leader O
of O
the O
Italian B-ORG
Forces I-ORG
then O
told O
Foglio B-ORG
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
define O
" O
a O
calendar O
of O
meetings O
, O
of O
course O
, O
reserved O
, O
with O
the O
personalities O
that O
matter O
to O
the O
Italian O
economy O
. O
" O

As O
for O
D'Alema B-PER
Berlusconi B-PER
, O
he O
says O
that O
he O
's O
" O
absolutely O
free O
from O
resentment O
, O
for O
his O
character O
and O
for O
his O
choice O
of O
life O
forever O
, O
" O
and O
renews O
his O
respect O
for O
him O
in O
the O
face O
of O
defeat O
. O

" O
I O
've O
always O
shown O
respect O
and O
respect O
for O
D'Alema B-PER
, O
who O
judges O
an O
intelligent O
person O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
do O
anything O
less O
of O
this O
fair O
- O
play O

now O
that O
the O
curse O
of O
such O
a O
heavy O
defeat O
is O
on O
him O
. O
" O

And O
then O
Berlusconi B-PER
hit O
the O
left O
. O

" O
It O
's O
not O
enough O
just O
to O
flirt O
with O
the O
Internet O
to O
be O
modern O
. O

It O
's O
not O
enough O
to O
be O
liberal O
to O
be O
real O

It O
's O
not O
enough O
to O
demonize O
the O
enemy O
, O
to O
threaten O
the O
enemy O
, O
to O
scourge O
the O
enemy O
with O
the O
tiniest O
propaganda O
to O
get O
your O
soul O
and O
identity O
. O
" O

Berlusconi B-PER
, O
however O
, O
explains O
that O
he O
found O
" O
a O
country O
waiting O
to O
be O
quietly O
and O
composedly O
freed O
from O
the O
feedingstuffs O
of O
an O
invasive O
, O
omnivorous O
power O
, O
which O
is O
identified O
with O
the O

and O
which O
can O
offer O
society O
only O
bribes O
. O
" O

The O
leader O
of O
the O
Italian B-ORG

also O
tells O
me O
that O
when O
the O
blue O

flew O

someone O
warned O
him O

" O

as O
well O
as O
the O
opposition O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
the O
country O
-- O
says O
Berlusconi B-PER
-- O
needed O
not O
just O
an O
alternative O
program O
and O
leadership O
, O
it O
needed O
above O
all O
a O
technique O
of O

an O
incentive O
to O
feel O
grown O

up O

empowered O

that O

a O

a O

A O
day O
of O

about O

" O

Prodi B-PER
then O
said O
no O
to O
any O
change O
to O
the O
parliamentary O
split O
before O
the O
election O
. O

Ciampi B-PER
Prodi B-PER
asked O
for O
" O
to O

the O

But O
his O
day O
also O
saw O
an O
end O
of O
controversy O

Within O
the O
alliance O
, O
about O
the O
imposition O
of O
countermeasures O
on O
the O

which O
has O
been O
challenged O
by O
some O
of O
the O
leaders O
, O
including O
the O
socialist O
Boselli B-PER
, O
because O
" O
it O
's O
a O
mistake O
to O
go O
down O
to O
Berlusconi B-PER

field O
" O
when O
he O
talks O
about O
tax O
cuts O
. O

There O
have O
been O
casualties O
beyond O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
center O
- O
right O
, O
such O
as O
the O
heated O
criticism O
of O
Prodi B-PER
accused O
by O
the O
D.C. B-ORG
of O
orchestrating O
the O
Ciampi B-PER
interview O

And O

to O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Gad B-ORG

of O

, O
taken O
into O
account O
, O
which O
echoes O
him O
with O
a O
hard O
- O
eared O
voice O
: O

" O
I O
think O
of O
Prodi B-PER
's O
criticisms O
as O
anything O
but O
bad O
. O
" O

At O
the O
anti O
- O
financial O
union O
rally O
, O
Prodi B-PER
sent O
out O
this O
message O
: O

" O
It O
's O
a O
very O
important O
start O
because O
it O
's O
a O
clear O
demonstration O
of O
the O
dissatisfaction O
with O
government O
policy O
. O
" O

Soon O
afterwards O
, O
the O
professor O
walks O
up O
to O
Quirinale O
, O
and O
later O
, O
to O
the O
reporters O
, O
he O
gives O
the O
meaning O
of O
his O
speech O
to O
Ciampi B-PER

" O
The O
game O
of O

" O
he O
says O
, O
referring O
to O

" O
is O
too O
important O

allow O
anyone O
to O
cheat O

" O

You O
ca O
n't O
change O
the O
rules O
when O
the O
game O
is O
about O

Shared O

are O
the O
only O
defense O

albeit O
partial O
, O
against O

speculation O

and O
that O

why O
they O

The O
unified O

of O

days O
fully O
justifies O
our O
alarm O

" O

But O
to O
the O
head O
of O
state O
, O
Prodi B-PER
points O
out O
that O
the O
government O
's O
maneuver O
needs O
to O
be O
taken O
together O
because O
it O
's O
inflated O

His O
background O

the O

quite O
marginal O

A O
no O
to O

version O
came O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
a O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O

, O
but O
trust O

probably O
be O
questioned O
this O
morning O

The O
steps O
that O
led O
to O
the O
new O
solution O
for O
the O
governor O

nomination O
were O
not O
easy O
, O
and O
some O
confusion O
arose O
when O
the O
Council O
of O

approved O
the O
amendments O
proposed O
by O
Tremonti B-PER
and O
allowed O
the O
votes O
of O

be O
taken O
. O
Casini B-PER

unregulated O
vote O
prevented O
the O
government O
from O
trusting O
everything O
. O

" O
The O
nomination O
criteria O
for O
the O
governor O
of O
Bankitalia B-ORG
do O
not O
change O
, O
" O
says O
Prime O
Minister O
Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
as O
he O
leaves O
the O
Chamber O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Council O

But O
at O
a O
press O
conference O
shortly O
afterwards O
, O
the O
minister O
of O
the O
economy O
, O
Julius B-PER
Tremonti I-PER
, O
gave O
a O
different O
set O
of O
guidelines O
. O

the O
governor O
's O
proposal O
is O
forwarded O
by O
the O
government O
, O
heard O
by O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Council I-ORG
of O
Bankitalia B-ORG
, O
to O
the O
governor O
who O
signs O
the O
name O
. O

Same O
procedure O
for O
the O
governor O
's O
removal O
. O

The O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
was O
preceded O
, O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
by O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
Tremonti B-PER
Synagogue O
, O
accompanied O
by O
the O
Undersecretary O
of O
the O
Presidency B-ORG
, O
Gianni B-PER
Letta I-PER
. O

Carlo B-PER
Azeglio I-PER
Ciampi I-PER
Tremonti B-PER
illustrates O
his O
proposal O
: O

the O
nomination O
of O
the O
governor O
proposed O
by O
the O
government O
, O
with O
a O
qualified O
majority O
in O
the O
parliament O
. O

That O
's O
a O
solution O
that O
Ciampi B-PER
does O
n't O
like O
because O
it O
would O
force O
the O
future O
governor O
of O
Bankitalia B-ORG
too O
much O
into O
political O
choices O
. O

Greater O
autonomy O
seems O
to O
guarantee O
the O
solution O
adopted O
, O
because O
it O
would O
reinforce O
the O
role O
of O
the O
House O
of O
Commons O
, O
which O
would O
have O
less O
flexibility O
to O
intervene O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
parliamentary B-ORG
vote O
. O

So O
the O
House B-ORG
of I-ORG
Representatives I-ORG
' O
opinion O
comes O
out O
of O
the O
government O
's O
proposal O
, O
and O
the O
solution O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
bother O
the O
opposition O
, O
although O
there O
's O
a O
clear O
hostility O
to O
many O
other O
aspects O
of O
the O
reform O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
, O
they O
all O
confirm O
the O
news O
of O
the O
government O
's O
amendments O
. O

The O
governor O
's O
term O
of O
office O
expires O
, O
six O
renewable O
years O
. O

even O
the O
CEO O
, O
who O
assumes O
more O
powers O
in O
the O
name O
of O
collegiality O
as O
requested O
by O
the O
BCE B-ORG
, O
is O
six O
years O
old O
, O
but O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
appointed O
by O
the O
top B-ORG
board I-ORG
of I-ORG
Bankitalia B-ORG
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
fake O
budget O
. O

The O
government O
is O
proposing O
the O
toughest O
legislation O
ever O
passed O
by O
the O
House B-ORG
of I-ORG
Representatives I-ORG
with O
the O
first O
reading O
of O
the O
Savings O
Act O
, O
which O
is O
still O
a O
little O
tougher O
than O
the O
current O
legislation O
. O

So O
, O
for O
false O
social O
communications O
, O
up O
to O
two O
years O
' O
imprisonment O
and O
lower O
thresholds O
for O
imprisonment O
for O
life O
imprisonment O
. O

The O
notion O
is O
" O
when O
it O
relates O
to O
a O
number O
of O
savers O
greater O
than O
0.1 O
percent O
of O
the O
population O
or O
has O
devalued O
an O
entity O
greater O
than O
0.1 O
percent O
of O
the O
population O
. O
" O

But O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
fake O
budgets O
, O
two O
votes O
of O
confidence O
are O
expected O
, O
to O
avoid O
the O
secret O
votes O
that O
should O
be O
cast O
, O
because O
the O
article O
also O
refers O
to O
sanctions O
and O
detentions O

It O
turned O
out O

it O
was O

built O
the O

This O

Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
: O
Do O
n't O
be O
fooled O

" O
You O
will O
soon O
know O
my O
intentions O
. O
" O

Since O
the O
Verdis B-ORG
already O
see O
him O
as O
the O
next O
retired O
, O
if O
they O
can O
imagine O
him O
, O
as O
if O
to O
say O
, O
gardeners O
feeding O
pigeons O
, O
we O
asked O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
if O
he O
really O
was O
going O
to O
retire O
from O
the O
race O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
do O
n't O
apply O
. O

" O
I O
'll O
look O
at O
the O
reserves O
soon O
-- O
he O
told O
us O
yesterday O
morning O
-- O
I O
think O
next O
week O
or O
a O
dozen O
days O
. O

Do O
n't O
tell O
me O
an O
exact O
date O
, O
but O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
soon O
. O

I O
know O
the O
rules O
of O
politics O
perfectly O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
tell O
you O
what O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
do O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
" O

And O
what O
about O
Valduga B-PER
Ballardini B-PER
's O
possible O
and O
probable O
candidacy O
? O

" O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
dinner O
during O
the O
election O
campaign O
. O

I O
think O
we O
went O
to O
a O
pizzeria O
once O
, O
but O
we O
paid O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
for O
the O
novel O
. O
" O

None O
of O
the O
assessments O
, O
and O
it O
also O
shows O
that O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
, O
as O
he O
said O
himself O
, O
knows O
the O
mechanics O
of O
politics O
. O

attacking O
a O
potentially O
hostile O
mayor O
now O
means O
legitimizing O
him O
prematurely O
, O
giving O
him O
unwittingly O
a O
push O
and O
also O
giving O
him O
the O
ability O
to O
rationalize O
the O
enemy O
's O
reactions O
. O

So O
Ballardini B-PER
avoids O
responding O
, O
if O
he O
's O
joking O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
even O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
summer O
, O
we O
're O
at O
an O
important O
political O
juncture O
. O

the O
waiting O
for O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
's O
yes O
or O
no O
is O
strategically O
important O
. O

It O
can O
complicate O
or O
make O
it O
easier O
to O
see O
things O
in O
the O
center O
left O
wherever O
you O
look O
. O

If O
she O
stays O
in O
the O
race O
, O
that O
would O
be O
a O
strong O
candidate O
, O
but O
there O
would O
be O
problems O
in O
the O
coalition O
. O

hardly O
any O
P.P. B-ORG
, O
any O
Green B-ORG
, O
any O
Secular O
would O
ever O
again O
accept O
a O
D.S. B-ORG
mayoral O
candidate O
. O

If O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he O
had O
to O
leave O
the O
center O
left O
, O
he O
would O
have O
to O
find O
a O
strong O
name O
to O
oppose O
Valduga B-PER
, O
who O
has O
the O
right O
cards O
to O
turn O
the O
left O
into O
the O
Podestà O
Palace O
. O

So O
this O
strange O
rover O
summer O
, O
already O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
hot O
spring O
for O
the O
climate O
, O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
politically O
interesting O
. O

Most O
likely O
Bonds B-PER
and O
Levites B-PER
From O

dry O
" O
no O
" O
Yes O
conditioned O
, O

with O
different O
endings O
, O
by O
Ds B-ORG
and O
Socialists B-ORG
, O
not O
dry O
from O
Communist B-ORG
Reconstruction I-ORG

The O
path O
indicated O
by O
Roberto B-PER
Pinter I-PER
to O
get O
to O
the O
2003 O
polling O
station O
appointment O
with O
a O
single O
list O
on O
the O
left O
is O
fairly O
tricky O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
's O
all O
going O
to O
be O
uphill O
. O

" O
But O
Pinter B-PER
's O
proposal O
, O
" O
says O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
, O
secretary O
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
, O
" O
is O
positive O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
and O
the O
path O
he O
's O
taken O
is O
certainly O
shared O
. O
" O

The O
leader O
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
, O
probably O
, O
would O
have O
preferred O
a O
little O
more O
courage O
. O

His O
ball O
is O
the O
only O
list O
, O
but O
the O
whole O
coalition O
, O
not O
just O
the O
left O
. O

" O
If O
he O
works O
for O
the O
left O
- O
wing O
unit O
-- O
admittedly O
-- O
I O
work O
for O
the O
center O
- O
right O
unit O
. O

The O
road O
is O
that O
, O
let O
's O
see O
if O
we O
're O
going O
to O
stop O
at O
an O
intermediate O
stop O
or O
if O
we O
're O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bottom O
. O
" O

But O
, O
to O
clarify O
matters O
, O
Bondi B-PER
assures O
me O
that O
" O
I O
, O
on O
the O
far O
left O
, O
would O
still O
sign O
. O
" O

More O
critically O
, O
Mauro B-PER
Leveghi I-PER
, O
the O
founder O
and O
CEO O
of O
Sdi B-ORG
: O

" O
Pinter B-PER
's O
is O
a O
hard O
proposition O
to O
make O
. O

Not O
impossible O
, O
but O
difficult O
. O
" O

It O
's O
difficult O
because O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
we O
have O
to O
clear O
the O
way O
for O
any O
kind O
of O
prejudice O
against O
people O
on O
the O
left O
who O
think O
differently O
. O

The O
reference O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
to O
the O
election O
law O
reform O
slides O
of O
the O
last O
few O
days O
. O

" O
You O
ca O
n't O
talk O
about O
alliances O
and O
aggregations O
-- O
Leveghi B-PER
confirms O
-- O
when O
you O
're O
going O
to O
put O
dirty O
cars O
on O
the O
content O
. O
" O

And O
then O
: O

" O
Let O
's O
first O
see O
if O
we O
can O
come O
up O
with O
an O
idea O
of O
electoral O
law O
without O
resorting O
to O
bribes O
. O
" O

This O
, O
at O
least O
, O
to O
Pinter B-PER
Leveghi B-PER
recognizes O
. O

" O
In O
fact O
, O
he O
's O
using O
a O
method O
of O
dialogue O
that O
's O
very O
different O
from O
what O
I O
've O
seen O
with O
Ds B-ORG
lately O
. O
" O

With O
these O
bases O
, O
the O
evaluator O
assures O
you O
, O
you O
can O
argue O
. O

It O
's O
also O
a O
single O
list O
. O

And O
what O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
intended O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
is O
that O
Agostino B-PER
Catalano I-PER
, O
the O
secretary O
of O
the O
Communist B-ORG
Reconstruction I-ORG
, O
was O
very O
critical O
of O
Pinter B-PER
's O
comments O
. O

" O
The O
problem O
is O
, O
the O
Ds B-ORG
, O
instead O
of O
proposing O
content O
, O
are O
trying O
to O
legally O
tie O
Dellai B-PER
into O
an O
alliance O
. O

The O
risk O
is O
that O
Dell B-PER
's O
going O
to O
accept O
the O
challenge O
, O
if O
you O
play O
the O
game O
and O
go O
and O
win O
it O
all O
at O
the O
head O
of O
a O
big O

. O
" O

Pinter B-PER
's O
hypothesis O
of O
a O
single O
left O

handed O
list O
is O
" O
less O
worse O
, O

still O
wrong O
. O
" O

So O
what O
? O

" O
We O
're O
proposing O
on O

the O
former O

now O
to O
his O
family O

We O
asked O
the O
critic O
Maurizio B-PER
Scudiero I-PER
, O
one O
of O
the O
great O
masters O
of O
the O
art O
of O
the O
futuristic O
artist O
. O

Most O
of O
all O
, O
he O
remembers O
a O
piece O
, O
a O
really O
precious O
piece O
of O
history O
, O
that O
was O
given O
to O
Bettino B-PER
right O
here O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC
. O

" O
In O
the O
late O
' O
80s O
, O
" O
Scudiero B-PER
says O
, O
" O
I O
went O
to O
Milan B-LOC
to O
see O
some O
of O
Depero B-PER
's O
paintings O
at O
Craxi I-PER
's O
house O
. O

I O
saw O
them O
on O
a O
furniture O
magazine O
, O
and O
I O
asked O
my O
family O
if O
they O
could O
see O
them O
. O

There O
were O
10 O
or O
so O
of O
them O
on O
a O
long O
wall O
behind O
his O
desk O
. O

He O
was O
n't O
there O
that O
day O
, O
and O
if O
I O
remember O
correctly O
, O
my O
wife O
also O
asked O
me O
for O
my O
opinion O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
her O
. O

They O
were O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
were O
n't O
historical O
, O
and O
they O
were O
largely O
purchased O
at O
the O
Cortina B-ORG
Gallery I-ORG
in O
Milan B-LOC
. O
" O

But O
one O
of O
them O
came O
from O
here O
, O
from O
Rovereto B-LOC
. O

" O
That O
's O
a O
really O
interesting O
piece O
of O
work O
. O

A O
painting O
called O
" O
The O
Panther O
, O
" O
which O
was O
given O
to O
Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER
here O
in O
January O
of O
' O
89 O
when O
the O
then O
Secretary O
of O
the O
Dogs B-ORG
was O
visiting O
in O
March O
. O

The O
artist O
's O
biggest O
show O
was O
opening O
, O
and O
I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
curators O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
one O
that O
opened O
in O
March B-ORG
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
, O
it O
was O
given O
, O
I O
think O
by O
the O
Federation B-ORG
of I-ORG
Dogs I-ORG
, O
to O
Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER
, O
the O
chair O
that O
belonged O
to O
a O
three O
- O
year O
- O
old O
collector O
. O

A O
piece O
from O
the O
' O
13s O
that O
's O
important O
because O
it O
belongs O
to O
Depero B-PER
, O
who O
was O
going O
to O
go O
into O
the O
future O
. O

Among O
the O
things O
that O
I O
saw O
in O
Milan B-LOC
were O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
telescopes O
, O
some O
splashes O
, O
the O
artist O
's O
creations O
from O
the O
original O
drawing O
. O

I O
remember O
one O
of O
them O
, O
" O
Baskets O
and O
Ladders O
. O
" O

Anyway O
, O
Craxi B-PER
Depero B-PER
liked O
it O
a O
lot O
, O
he O
was O
a O
Futurist O
kind O
of O
guy O
. O

He O
had O
the O
intentional O
taste O
for O
Fortunate B-PER
Depero I-PER
. O

And O
indeed O
, O
" O
The O
Panther O
" O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
intentional O
thinking O
. O

It O
's O
not O
about O
economic O
value O
, O
it O
's O
about O
artistic O
value O
above O
all O
. O

" O
It O
was O
Depero B-PER
, O
" O
says O
Scudiero B-PER
, O
" O
still O
very O
expressive O
, O
the O
future O
traces O
start O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
these O
stars O
. O
" O

Beyond O
the O
historical O
and O
artistic O
aspects O
, O
today O
it O
's O
a O
reminder O
of O
a O
time O
brought O
to O
mind O
by O
a O
newspaper O
article O
that O
depicted O
the O
ruins O
of O
Hammamet B-LOC
's O
villa O
, O
describing O
them O
as O
a O
treasure O
. O

That O
treasure O
, O
in O
the O
years O
when O
Craxi B-PER
was O
evil O
, O
was O
portrayed O
in O
the O
press O
and O
on O
TV O
as O
something O
of O
a O
galaxy O
. O

it O
even O
talked O
about O
a O
trillion O
! O

Now O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
they O
say O
the O
Tunisian O
villa O
is O
not O
such O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

That O
's O
the O
way O
the O
world O
or O
at O
least O
Italy B-LOC
goes O
. O

Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER
's O
visit O
to O
Rovereto B-LOC
leaves O
this O
memory O
, O
the O
gift O
of O
Depero B-PER
's O
Panther O
, O
the O
smiling O
photos O
. O

They O
look O
a O
century O
old O
, O
and O
it O
's O
only O
been O
11 O
years O

Even O
though O

there O
may O
be O
divergences O

we O
find O
it O

you O

the O

Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER

like O
my O

Denis B-PER
Bertolini I-PER
-- O
had O
gone O
to O
present O
a O
question O
to O
the O
president O
of O
Palau B-PER

The O
goal O
was O
to O
have O
a O

those O
planned O

Bondi B-PER
, O
in O
particular O
, O
wonders O
about O
the O
purposes O
of O
a O
series O
of O
" O
very O
varied O
and O
not O
always O
immediately O
comparable O
interventions O
to O

for O
the O
uplift O
of O
Mount B-LOC
Bondone I-LOC
. O
" O

Well O
, O
from O
the O
answer O
given O
by O
the O
programmer O
Gianluca B-PER
Salvatori I-PER
comes O
some O
very O
interesting O
data O
. O

The O
private O
investment O
questions O
considered O
consistent O
by O
the O
public O
sector O
are O
472 O
, O
for O
an O
amount O
of O
almost O
107 O
million O
euros O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
it O
for O
the O
sectors O
that O
are O
universally O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
driving O
force O
behind O
the O
Bondone B-LOC
. O

76 O
million O
in O
tourism O
, O
11 O
million O
in O
ski O
runs O
and O
2 O
million O
in O
agriculture O
. O

But O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
, O
among O
the O
contributions O
that O
Piazza B-LOC
Dante I-LOC
is O
making O
to O
revitalize O
the O
Trento B-LOC
Mountain O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
hundreds O
and O
hundreds O
of O
dollars O
for O
heating O
replacements O
and O
for O
rebuilding O
the O
facades O
of O
the O
houses O
, O
there O
are O
requests O
for O
contributions O
of O
640,000 O
dollars O
that O
will O
be O
used O
to O
rebuild O
retaining O
walls O
, O
fences O
and O
armed O
land O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
. O

Nearly O
a O
million O
and O
100,000 O
euros O
were O
requested O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
new O
fruit O
plantations O
, O
the O
construction O
of O
irrigation O
systems O
and O
anti O
- O
poaching O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
think O
about O
a O
cable O
car O
in O
Bondone B-LOC
, O
near O
the O
tracks O
, O
maybe O
placed O
so O
that O
the O
skiers O
can O
do O
the O
slalom O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
you O
're O
completely O
wrong O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Sopramonte B-LOC
and O
Sardagna B-LOC
, O
which O
are O
still O
part O
of O
the O
boundaries B-LOC
of I-LOC
Bondone I-LOC
or O
are O
closely O
linked O
to O
Bondone O
, O
new O
crops O
will O
also O
grow O
on O
the O
plain O
, O
for O
example O
in O
Romagnano B-LOC
. O

So O
on O
the O
table O
at O
the O
Provincial B-LOC

came O
also O
a O

Now O
the O
province B-LOC

going O
to O
have O
to O
get O
an O
instructor O
to O
check O
whether O
the O
purchase O
items O
that O
they O
've O
requested O
are O
eligible O
and O
whether O
the O
purchases O
are O
matching O
. O

On O
the O
costs O
that O
will O
be O
deemed O
to O
be O
structural O
to O
the O
entrepreneurial O

the O

will O
apply O
a O

that O
will O
average O
between O
30 O
and O
40 O
percent O
of O

In O
his O
response O
to O

he O
writes O
that O
the O
goal O
of O
the O

something O

Sergio B-PER
Franceschinelli I-PER

was O
there O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
vitality O
of O
the O
33 O
choirs O
-- O
a O
total O
of O
878 O
choirs O
-- O
that O
live O
in O
Trento B-LOC

It O
's O
a O
growing O
reality O
that O
has O
been O
able O
to O
engage O
young O
people O
while O
maintaining O
a O
connection O
to O
the O
traditional O
world O

On O
the O
controversy O
over O
the O
Cogo B-PER
, O
Franceschinelli B-PER
preferred O
to O
blurt O
out O
, O
explaining O
that O
he O
had O
sent O
Dante B-LOC

the O
streets O
in O
a O
rather O
harsh O
version O
of O
the O
statements O
issued O
by O
the O
advisor O
to O
the B-ORG
Adige I-ORG
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
perhaps O
in O
response O
to O
the O
Congolese B-PER
demand O
for O
more O
space O
for O
modern O
culture O
, O
the O
races O
will O
soon O
begin O
with O

rediscover O
the O

ancient O
crafts O

canteen O
, O
sawmill O

mill O

Maybe O
Burma O
, O
but O
at O

the O
relationship O
with O
the O

there O

" O

a O
lot O

willingness O
on O
our O

the O

that O

In O
the O

a O

came O
out O
saying O
, O
the O
center O

left O
is O
saying O
: O

" O
Great O
Concern O

" O

But O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
so O
far O
the O
political O
- O
programming O
comparison O
with O
Patt B-ORG
has O
been O
essentially O
positive O
. O

The O
center O

right O
forces O
point O
out O
that O
" O
in O
agreement O
with O
all O
provincial O
chiefs O
, O

, O
the O
next O

meeting O
has O
been O
scheduled O
for O
Tuesday O
, O
January O
26th O
. O
" O

Given O
these O
deadlines O
, O
the O
center O
- O
right O
coalition O
believes O
it O
's O
imperative O
that O
by O
Saturday O
, O
January O
23rd O
, O
Patt B-ORG
, O
like O
everyone O
else O
who O
has O
previously O
publicly O
announced O
and O
convened O
, O
should O
make O
a O
decision O
. O

It O
is O
expected O
that O
such O
a O
decision O
will O
be O
taken O
positively O
, O
complementing O
the O
consensus O
hypotheses O
that O
have O
been O
in O
the O
pipeline O
for O
weeks O
now O
. O

Otherwise O
-- O
the O
note O
goes O
on O

first O
of O
all O
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
institutional O
obligations O
and O
in O

with O
the O
accountability O
to O
the O

, O
and O
also O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
grave O
confusion O
and O
turmoil O
that O
is O
emerging O
in O
public O
opinion O
in O
Trento O
, O
the O
centre O
- O
right O
coalition O
will O
find O
it O
necessary O
and O
unacceptable O
to O
take O
all O
the O
political O
and O
institutional O
initiatives O
necessary O
for O
the O
proper O
functioning O
of O
the O
provincial O

for O

Out O
of O
metaphor O

the O
blue O

person O
wants O
to O
wait O
until O
Saturday O
, O
but O
then O
they O
're O
going O
to O
start O
looking O
around O
. O

Everybody O
denies O
that O
there O
are O
any O
more O
contacts O
going O
on O
with O
the O
Center O
, O
but O
it O
makes O
sense O
to O
expect O
that O
the O
Dellai B-PER
coalition O
is O
somehow O
going O
to O
find O
an O
18th O
necessary O
vote O
to O
get O
the O

At O
yesterday B-ORG

in O

, O
there O
was O
also O
the O
hypothesis O

for O
now O
, O
Dellai B-PER
does O
n't O
want O
to O
hear O
about O
it O

" O
We O
could O

In O
the O
evening O
came O

where O
he O
reaffirmed O
the O

said O
, O

" O

come O

of O

, O
Giorgio B-PER

some O
of O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O

important O
to O
remember O
that O

going O

, O
no O
one O
has O
come O

ask O
for O
the O
resignation O
of O
Mauro B-PER

who O
, O
on O
his O
part O
, O
prefers O
to O
keep O
a O
low O

To O
date O
, O
he O

announced O
some O
answers O

" O
As O
far O
as O
the O

are O
concerned O
, O
we O
can O

, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
happen O
after O
the O
political O
elections O
. O

It O
's O
not O
official O
, O
but O
there O
are O
voices O
within O
the O
Senate O
that O
are O
increasingly O
supportive O
of O
the O
advice O
given O
by O
the O
same O
senator O
to O
George B-PER
Lunelli I-PER
, O
who O
has O
been O
the O
leader O
of O

The O
Roman O
translation O
of O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
's O
last O
few O
days O
served O
as O
a O
clarification O
, O
but O
in O
some O
ways O
it O
also O
brought O
a O
cold O
shower O
. O

Uncertainty O
because O
it O
's O
clear O
now O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O

and O
Margherita B-ORG
will O
come O
together O
, O
with O

as O
the O
headliner O
, O
as O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O

And O
the O
cold O
shower O
? O

Yes O
, O
because O
it O
was O
understood O
that O
Bolzano B-LOC

Volkspartei O
had O
a O
direct O
line O
with O
Rome B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
Gianclaudio B-PER

But O
there O

more O
hope O

if O
the O

to O

he O
could O

seems O
certain O
. O

The O
candidate O
could O
be O
Giacomo B-PER

The O
autocrats O
were O
expecting O
a O
different O

and O
now O
the O
even O

" O

But O
the O
space O
that O
Bressa B-PER
conquered O
with O
the O

of O

risks O
making O

Since O
1992 O
, O
Siric B-ORG
, O
for O
reasons O
of O
strength O
, O
has O
become O
incompetent O
. O

Already O
since O
July O
1989 O
, O
though O
, O
the O
company O
has O
n't O
paid O
because O
of O
the O
seizure O
of O
the O
plant O
by O
the O
court O
following O
the O
fire O
that O
killed O
two O
people O
. O

On O
April O
11 O
, O
2000 O
, O
the O
ministry O
informed O
the O
company O
that O
it O
had O
failed O
to O
meet O
the O
five O
- O
digit O
repayment O
rates O
of O
the O
grant O
, O
and O
invited O
the O
company O
to O
submit O
it O
within O
thirty O
days O
. O

if O
it O
were O
n't O
, O
it O
would O
have O
settled O
the O
contract O
on O
its O
own O
. O

On O
June O
12 O
, O
2001 O
, O
the O
Director O
- O
General O
, O
who O
had O
not O
received O
a O
response O
, O
reaffirmed O
his O
intention O
to O
use O
the O
resolution O
clause O
and O
stated O
that O
the O
amount O
owed O
was O
over O
two O
billion O
lire O
to O
be O
paid O
within O
60 O
days O
. O

With O
the O
silence O
of O
Siric B-ORG
, O
the O
minister O
proceeded O
to O
recover O
the O
full O
amount O
of O
the O
contributions O
, O
notifying O
the O
company O
via O
the O
Garda B-LOC
-- O
through O
the O

of O
the O

" O
In O
a O
controversial O
case O
, O
" O
the O
administrative O
judges O
ruled O
, O
" O
the O
funding O
is O
disciplined O
in O
its O
execution O
by O
the O
negotiating O
rules O
held O
between O
the O
parties O
. O

It O
's O
a O
real O
contract O
in O
which O
a O
settlement O
clause O
has O
been O
inserted O
that O
was O
expressly O
recalled O
by O
the O
ministry O
in O
the O
notes O
of O
April O
11 O
, O
2000 O
and O
June O
12 O
, O
2001 O
. O

The O
board O
therefore O
finds O
that O
the O
matter O
under O
appeal O
falls O
within O
the O
competence O
of O
the O
administrative O
judge O
and O
falls O
within O
the O
competence O
of O
the O
ordinary O
judge O
. O
" O

And O
so O
it O
did O
, O
going O
to O
the O
court B-ORG
of I-ORG
appeal I-ORG
that O
heard O
the O
appeal O
of O
Zadra B-PER
Giovanni B-PER

Lutti I-PER

lawyer O
( O
who O
, O
contrary O
to O
what O
we O
said O
on O

, O
did O
not O
deal O
with O

of O

fatal O
fire O
, O
having O
entered O
the O

. O

So O
the O
30 O

year O
- O
old O

annulled O
the O
exact O

by O
which O
Uniriscossion B-ORG

But O
there O

" O
If O
our O

-- O
say O

Roland B-PER

-- O
the O
total O
annual O

is O
6.993 O
hours O

Just O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
reasoning O
to O
understand O
that O
then O
the O
trainees O
are O
taking O
8.88 O
euros O
an O
hour O
-- O
124,000 O
divided O

not O

the O
Ministry O

" O

" O
We O
do O

understand O
, O
" O
says O
Casagranda B-PER

Caramelle B-PER
with O
a O
calculator O
in O

" O
how O
the O

The O
cleanliness O

So O
, O
since O
the O

we O
have O
to O

, O

you O

have O
you O
cut O
down O

Or O
maybe O
there O

Meanwhile O

the O

highly O

that O
that O

a O
strategy O
that O

shows O
that O

fully O

: O

" O
The O

the O

discouraging O

This O

I O
say O
to O
ourselves O
, O

" O

The O

a O
very O
low O

himself O

in O
Moscow B-LOC
with O
Russian O
President O
Vladimir B-PER
Putin I-PER
and O
Foreign O
Minister O
Igor B-PER
Ivanov I-PER
, O
realized O
that O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
a O
single O
resolution O
on O
the O
U.N. B-ORG
inspectors O
' O
mission O
to O
Iraq B-LOC

which O
would O
also O
include O
the O
use O
of O

so O

also O
embraced O

is O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
approved O
by O
the O
United O
Nations O

Berlusconi B-PER
also O
expressed O
his O
" O
personal O
opinion O
" O
by O
not O
believing O
that O
Iraq B-LOC
possesses O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
today O
" O
not O
because O
they O
could O
n't O
be O
, O
but O
because O
now O
is O
the O
time O
for O
their O
elimination O
or O
a O
different O
allocation O
. O
" O

Berlusconi B-PER
, O
he O
added O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
, O
said O
what O
Putin B-PER
also O
believed O
. O

The O
first O
Italian O
Prime O
Minister O
on O
his O
third O
official O
visit O
to O
Russia B-LOC
since O
he O
was O
in O
office O
as O
head O
of O
the O
current O
government O
, O
was O
received O
by O
Putin B-PER
at O
Kremlin O
, O
where O
he O
sat O
down O
for O
a O
working O
breakfast O
. O

" O
I O
continue O
to O
believe O
that O
practically O
, O
" O
Berlusconi B-PER
said O
in O
a O
meeting O
with O
the O
Italian O
press O
, O
" O
it O
would O
have O
been O
more O
appropriate O
to O
have O
a O
resolution O
" O
that O
, O
in O
the O
event O
of O
Iraq O
's O
non O
- O
compliance O
with O
the O
U.N. B-ORG
decisions O
, O
would O
have O
provided O
for O
" O
immediate O

action O

disarm O
Iraq B-LOC

" O

" O
But O
things O
have O
gone O
in O
a O
different O
direction O
. O
" O

From O
Putin B-PER
Berlusconi B-PER
, O
however O
, O
he O
got O
a O
renewed O
" O
yes O
" O
to O
the O
adoption O
of O
a O
" O
strong O
" O
U.S. B-ORG
resolution O
on O
U.S. B-ORG
inspectors O
' O
mission O
, O
which O
, O
the O
Russian O
president O
observed O
, O
must O
be O
addressed O
to O
Iraq B-LOC
" O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
order O
to O
remove O
all O
concerns O
of O
the O
international O
community O
. O
" O

" O
Russia B-LOC
has O
been O
persuaded O
by O
British O
Prime O
Minister O
Tony B-PER
Blair I-PER
and O
by O
my O
insistence O
-- O
Berlusconi B-PER
said O
-- O
not O
to O
oppose O
a O
strong O
resolution O
concerning O
the O
visit O
of O
inspectors O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
inquiring O
, O
without O
preconditions O
and O
without O
restrictions O
, O
even O
in O
presidential O
buildings O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
there O
are O
weapons O

mass O
destruction O

" O

If O
the O
inspections O
were O
to O
detect O
Iraqi O
irregularities O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
" O
it O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
resort O
to O
a O
new O
resolution O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
that O
would O
allow O
for O
armed O
intervention O

We O
are O
convinced O
that O
the O
situation O
in O
Iraq O
is O
troubling O
to O
all O
of O
us O
, O
" O
and O
then O
Berlusconi B-PER
responded O
to O
those O
who O
asked O
him O
to O
clarify O
the O
new O
position O
taken O
by O
Italy B-LOC

but O
" O
we O
are O
pragmatic O
. O
" O

The O
Italian O
one O
yesterday O
said O
, O
" O
It O
's O
a O
concrete O
position O
that O
does O

push O
us O
either O
side O

the O
other O

" O

The O
prime O

then O
remarked O
that O
he O
felt O
in O

with O
Blair B-PER

Bush B-PER
, O
but O
also O
that O
he O
needed O
to O
be O
realistic O

he O
added O

" O

no O
interest O

take O
into O
account O

Its O

The O

all O

The O

flying O
alone O

they O

all O
the O

Faustino B-PER

A O

In O

that O

nothing O

In O

end O
, O
Marco B-PER
Catania I-PER

brought O
to O
victory O
by O
his O
teammates O
, O
the O
runner O
is O
not O

the O

The O
winner O
is O
the O
one O
who O
has O
learned O
to O
be O
more O
aggressive O
, O
the O
one O
who O
has O
consistently O
refused O
to O
retreat O
in O
what O
is O
a O
tough O

selective O

costly O
race O
from O
the O
point O
of O

of O

The O

about O

" O

the O

who O
just O
happens O
to O
be O
in O
the O
wrong O
place O
at O
the O
right O

in O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
inevitable O
social O
upheavals O
caused O
by O
the O
shift O
of O
hands O
between O
the O
old O
management O

him O

beyond O
all O

Gigetto B-PER
paid O

he O
was O

" O
then O
called O
back O

saved O
the O

not O
an O
easy O
situation O

when O

you O

on O
the O

setback O
in O

The O

Capuzzo B-PER
did O
what O
he O
was O
asked O
to O
do O
with O
a O
team O
that O
could O
hardly O
have O
done O
more O
. O

The O
eleven O

-- O
as O
the O

always O
admitted O

are O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O

but O
a O
lot O
of O
mishaps O
and O
mishaps O
have O
often O
put O

between O
the O

The O
third O
place O
in O
the O
standings O
in O
Pizzighettone B-LOC
today O
-- O
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
victory O
it O
would O
be O
sure O
, O
although O
probably O
in O
cohabitation O
-- O
would O
represent O
a O
fair O
reward O
-- O
and O
recognition O
-- O
to O
the O
professionalism O
of O
a O
group O
that O
defeated O
the O
modern O

risked O
undermining O

But O
in O
certain O

And O
what O
has O
happened O
, O
on O
many O
other O

The O

A O

because O
in O

, O
Sabina B-PER

The O
only O
thing O

that O

victory O
( O
in O
Belluno B-LOC

the O
recovery O
of O
a O

anyway O
scheduled O
for O
November O
) O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
couples O
with O
the O
Italian B-ORG
S.Marco I-ORG
. O

Homeowners O
who O
have O
to O
give O
up O
different O
legs O
and O
who O
for O
the O
first O
time O
are O
offering O
a O
form O
that O
starts O
with O
the O
trident O
, O
but O
soon O
it O
becomes O
with O
three O
advanced O
center O
fielders O
behind O
Vianello B-PER
. O

The O
Sanvitese B-ORG
responds O
with O
three O
defenders O
and O
Perenzin B-PER
on O
screen O
in O
front O
of O
the O
defense O
and O
supported O
by O
a O
center O
four O
behind O
the O
two O
points O
Fantini B-PER
and O
Rossi B-PER
. O

It O
's O
Massimiliano B-PER
Rossi I-PER
, O
27 O
years O
old O
today O
, O
who O
is O
given O
a O
double O
gift O
with O
the O
two O
networks O
that O
in O
the O
first O
fraction O
allow O
his O
peers O
to O
immediately O
recover O
from O
the O
disadvantage O
. O

The O
game O
begins O
with O
a O
very O
good O
effervescence O
between O
the O
two O
mates O
, O
even O
though O
it O
does O
n't O
end O
in O
the O
first O
10 O
minutes O
. O

At O
12 O
o'clock O
, O
the O
Mezzocorona B-PER
is O
the O
first O
to O
oscillate O
with O
a O
beautiful O
jump O
from O
the O
inspired O
Mariotti B-PER
for O
Vianello B-PER
's O
head O
that O
does O
n't O
surprise O
him O
. O

You O
have O
to O
wait O
26 O
seconds O
for O
the O
first O
advantage O
that O
comes O
from O
a O
beautiful O
matching O
of O
Points B-PER
to O
Poles B-PER
that O
allows O
this O
last O
one O
to O
penetrate O
from O
the O
left O
, O
Points O
to O
Venus O
, O
rejected O
by O
Franceschinis B-PER
on O
the O
line O
, O
but O
Vianello B-PER
( O
the O
thirteenth O
center O
) O
finally O
turns O
on O
the O
open O
door O
network O
. O

The O
joy O
does O
n't O
last O
long O
, O
at O
29 O
Sannino B-PER
fishes O
from O
three O
- O
quarters O
of O
Ross B-PER
, O
able O
to O
avoid O
the O
outburst O
and O
beat O
Bass B-PER
of O
Justice O
. O

The O
game O
's O
still O
going O
on O
, O
and O
after O
a O
punishment O
for O
Central O
Waylander B-PER
, O
it O
's O
again O
the O
Sanvites B-PER
who O
are O
getting O
dangerous O
all O
the O
time O
on O
the O
outfield O
with O
Fantini B-PER
looking O
for O
a O
ball O
, O
but O
finding O
the O
recovery O
of O
Berardo B-PER
. O

The O
Midfielder B-PER
finds O
his O
40s O
advantage O
when O
Mariotti B-PER
steals O
a O
three O
- O
quarters O
shot O
and O
he O
bounces O
left O
in O
the O
opposite O
seven O
and O
finds O
the O
goal O
-- O
and O
what O
a O
goal O
! O
-- O
after O
a O
few O
months O
of O
shooting O
. O

But O
this O
time O
, O
again O
, O
the O
Sanvites B-PER
are O
looking O
for O
the O
match O
with O
Fantini B-PER
, O
who O
on O
the O
right O
puts O
him O
in O
the O
middle O
and O
finds O
the O
usual O
Rossi B-PER
ready O
in O
the O
winning O
deflection O
area O
. O

The O
second O
time O
, O
the O
pace O
slows O
down O
, O
even O
though O
Rossi B-PER
at O
5 O
's O
is O
scared O
low O
with O
a O
left O
- O
handed O
cross O
shot O
snapped O
into O
the O
corner O
of O
his O
home O
porch O
. O

So O
shortly O
afterwards O
, O
Francesca B-PER
waves O
to O
the O
left O
and O
she O
puts O
a O
dangerous O
balloon O
in O
the O
area O
that O
nobody O
finds O
. O

At O
15 O
, O
however O
, O
here O
's O
the O
net O
of O
Friulian O
victory O
that O
emerges O
from O
an O
initiative O
of O
the O
usual O
Rossi B-PER
, O
good O
at O
flying O
to O
the O
left O
by O
avoiding O
a O
" O
light O
" O
Berardo B-PER
and O
pulling O
back O
for O
the O
sighted O
Preditera B-PER
, O
who O
first O
- O
intentionally O
hits O
the O
first O
pole O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
legs O
. O

There O
's O
some O
doubt O
about O
Fantini B-PER
's O
position O
, O
but O
the O
network O
is O
validated O
. O

The O
homeowners O
go O
on O
to O
look O
for O
the O
match O
, O
but O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
, O
the O
red O
- O
and O
- O
white O
defense O
is O
always O
good O
on O
guard O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
players O
. O

At O
33 O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
combination O
of O
Baido B-PER
-- O
Vianello B-PER
-- O
Mariotti B-PER
that O
allows O
the O
attacker O
solandro O
to O
finish O
, O
but O
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

After O
a O
rivalry O
with O
Rossi B-PER
, O
repulsed O
by O
Moratti B-PER
, O
he O
's O
the O
same O
ex O
- O
Trentino B-LOC
defenseman O
who O
's O
pushing O
forward O
on O
Vianello B-PER
's O
assists O
, O
but O
Venuto B-PER
's O
timely O
departure O
makes O
all O
the O
difference O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
December O
is O
over O
, O
and O
since O
2006 O
, O
the O
Mezzocorona B-PER
has O
to O
recover O

, O

and O

, O
is O
still O
an O
objective O
rather O
than O
achievable O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
rapporteur O
pointed O
out O
the O
numerous O
discriminatory O
factors O
that O
still O
exist O
, O
including O
the O
diversity O
of O

that O
go O
against O
achieving O

The O
canoe O

, O
when O
asked O
by O
the O
moderator O
how O
much O
the O
sport O
had O
taken O
away O
from O
her O
and O
given O
her O
, O
talked O
about O
her O
unrestrained O
life O
, O
highlighting O
the O
satisfaction O
she O
got O
from O
being O
aware O
that O
she O
had O
achieved O
what O
she O
was O
being O
pitched O
. O

Stefania B-PER
Belmondo I-PER
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
reminded O
us O
of O
the O
difficulties O
we O
face O
in O
achieving O
certain O
outcomes O
, O
like O
breaking O
a O
stick O
that O
can O
compromise O
years O
of O
preparation O
in O
the O
most O
important O
race O
. O

The O
former O
cyclist O
Belluti B-PER
then O
illustrated O
his O
role O
as O
a O
representative O
of O
the O
athletes O
within O
the O
Coni B-ORG
and O
the O
main O
economic O
difficulties O
that O
this O
organization O
is O
going O
through O
. O

There O
have O
been O
questions O
raised O
about O
the O
inefficient O
aspects O
of O
sport O
, O
such O
as O
doping O
. O

The O
champions O
pointed O
out O
that O
such O
things O
, O
especially O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
information O
organizations O
, O
ca O
n't O
detract O
from O
the O
promotion O
and O
outcomes O
of O
sporting O
activities O
, O
especially O
those O
that O
are O
less O
well O
- O
promoted O
, O
and O
that O
at O
the O
Olympic O
level O
, O
they O
always O
lead O
to O
the O
highest O
number O
of O
wins O
. O

The O
self O

guy O
is O
shaking O
the O

but O
he O

that O
the O
whole O

is O
upside O

down O

Andreotti B-PER
: O

President O
, O
decides O
Thirty B-LOC
- O
three O
not O
the O
Svp B-ORG
. O

" O
You O
ca O
n't O
find O
the O
square O
of O
the O
circle O
, O
even O
the O
Dellai B-PER
Durnwalder B-PER
axis O
finds O
it O
difficult O
... O
" O

President O
Andreotti B-PER
, O
does O
that O
make O
you O
happy O
? O

No O
, O
absolutely O
not O
. O

I O
'm O
less O
or O
less O
satisfied O
with O
the O
difficulties O
of O
Dellai B-PER
, O
with O
whom O
I O
have O
a O
very O
good O
relationship O
. O

But O
it O
's O
when O
the O
newspapers O
are O
happily O
dismissed O
that O
they O
're O
happy O
. O

We O
've O
been O
considered O
traitors O
because O
we O
've O
delayed O
every O
decision O
, O
but O
from O
the O
standpoint O
of O
the O
negotiations O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
even O
if O
there O
was O
the O
Patt B-ORG
MP O
, O
nothing O
would O
have O
been O
done O
-- O

But O
the O
distances O
from O
the O
center O
- O
south O
to O
the O
region B-LOC
are O
decreasing O
. O

Yeah O
. O

We O
all O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
in O
different O
languages O
. O

It O
's O
basically O
not O
that O
far O
away O
. O

The O
big O
problem O
is O
the O
so O
- O
called O
bicameral O
oversight O
of O
the O
region B-LOC
. O

And O
probably O
in O
all O
of O
this O
, O
some O
errors O
of O
assessment O
Dellai B-PER
did O
. O

If O
diplomatically O
he O
did O
it O
differently O
, O
on O
December O
18th O
in O
the O
provincial O
council O
he O
became O
president O
. O

And O
also O
to O
deal O
with O
HIV B-ORG
, O
they O
wanted O
to O
time O
- O
lapse O
. O

I O
say O
this O
in O
complete O
silence O
, O
without O
criticism O
. O

So O
are O
you O
building O
a O
new O
region B-LOC
? O

On O
the O
Patt B-ORG
delegation O
, O
yes O
, O
we O
do O
, O
but O
we O
realize O
that O
on O
the O
party O
side O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
a O
big O
problem O
figuring O
out O
that O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
the O
anti O
- O
communist O
chamber O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
. O

Then O
there O
's O
the O
paradox O
. O

The O
Verdis B-ORG
want O
you O
to O
run O
for O
the O
presidency O
of O
the O
region B-LOC
, O
the O
Svp B-ORG
no O
... O

The O
Sabbath B-ORG
was O
never O
really O
pronounced O
. O

Brugger B-PER
just O
said O
, O
" O
We O
are O
the O
two O
contenders O
. O
" O

But O
it O
was O
a O
joke O
. O

We O
've O
been O
accused O
of O
being O
the O
stupid O
servants O
of O
the O
state O
government B-ORG
, O
but O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
region B-LOC
, O
the O
trainees O
say O
to O
the O
state B-ORG
government I-ORG
, O
" O
You O
decide O
. O
" O

It O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
that O
kind O
of O
behavior O
. O

The O
agreement O
on O
the O
presidency O
is O
reached O
in O
Trento B-LOC
, O
even O
by O
deciding O
to O
leave O
it O
to O
Svp B-ORG
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
Brugger B-PER
's O
blessing O
, O
because O
then O
it O
would O
mean O
we O
're O
screwed O
, O
as O
I O
'm O
afraid O
someone O
did O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
Verdi B-ORG
's O
applause O
is O
weird O
. O

That O
's O
true O
, O
but O
on O
issues O
like O
warranty O
, O
I O
've O
always O
liked O
Boato B-PER
. O

On O
land O
issues O
, O
we O
disagree O
a O
little O
less O
. O

But O
we O
ask O
why O
the O
U.S. B-ORG
government I-ORG
wants O
to O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
and O
then O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
it O
in O
Bolzano B-LOC
. O

How O
do O
you O
get O
the O
majority O
of O
them O
to O
be O
in O
the O
region B-LOC
and O
not O
in O
Bolzano B-LOC

Many O

enthusiasts O
of O
a O
certain O
age O
will O
recall O
many O
years O
ago O
when O
Rizieri B-PER

Ermanno B-PER

Rizieri B-PER
Brunialti I-PER
was O
the O
first O
, O
far O
away O
in O
1927 O
, O
to O
write O
his O
name O
in O
the O
golden O
epoch O
of O
the O
race O
, O
a O
race O
known O
for O
its O
few O
interruptions O
, O
which O
ran O
even O
during O
the O
war O
, O
since O
at O
that O
time O
it O
was O
reserved O
for O
the O
very O
young O
, O
extroverted O
, O
aspirational O
classes O
, O
pupils O
who O
at O
best O
had O
to O
embrace O
the O
" O
imitation O

of O
the O

The O
classical O
Bolshevik O
turn O
, O
which O
was O
born O
in O
1927 O
, O
has O
expanded O
its O
field O
of O

to O
include O
juniors O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
amateurs O
under O
the O
age O

In O
1949 O
, O
the O
Circuito O

was O
awarded O
a O
prestigious O
trophy O
, O
the O
Grand O

Ignis O
, O
which O
ran O
until O
1972 O
, O
and O
among O
the O
winners O
were O
the O
names O
of O
Italian O
cyclists O
such O
as O
Vasco B-PER

Closed O
in O
1972 O
, O
the O
happy O
legacy O
of O
the O
Ignis O
Grand O
Prix O
, O
while O
the O
Giro O
d'Italia O
continues O
its O
long O
history O
with O
the O
various O
categories O
of O
extroverts O
, O
beginners O
, O
juniors O
and O
amateurs O
, O
in O
1966 O
there O
were O
two O
winners O
, O
Mario B-PER
Bampi I-PER
, O
an O
extrovert O
, O
and O
Dario B-PER
Bonato I-PER
, O
the O
first O
amateur O
to O
enter O
the O
golden O
era O
. O

So O
why O
do O
n't O
we O
open O
up O
the O
competition O
to O
amateurs O
too O
, O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
cyclists O
for O
fun O
, O
more O
and O
more O
real O
athletes O
, O
often O
stronger O
and O
stronger O
than O
some O
professional O
athletes O
? O

In O
1993 O
, O
Bolívar O
officially O
opened O
to O
amateurs O
, O
winning O
Maurizio B-PER
Valcanover I-PER
. O

And O
in O
the O
golden O
epoch O
we O
find O
names O
like O
Valentini O
, O
who O
's O
three O
times O
as O
tall O
as O
the O
hill O
, O
Bazzanella B-PER
Grisenti B-PER
, O
Blessed B-PER
, O
not O
too O
young O
, O
but O
always O
very O
strong O
, O
and O
most O
of O
all O
, O
very O
in O
love O
with O
the O
bike O
. O

And O
on O
top O
of O
it O
all O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Silvano B-PER
Janes I-PER
, O
five O
- O
time O
amateur O
circuit O
winner O
, O
first O
again O
last O
year O
, O
and O
certainly O
starting O
today O
, O
certainly O
not O
to O
make O
a O
comeback O
but O
to O
bring O
his O
handkerchief O
to O
the O
top O
. O

He O
was O
joined O
by O
many O
other O
athletes O
of O
different O
ages O
, O
but O
they O
were O
all O
united O
by O
one O
passion O
, O
and O
that O
was O
bicycles O
. O

And O
they O
've O
been O
invited O
to O
come O
to O
this O
year O
's O
unique O
competition O
. O

for O
its O
ninth O
edition O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
sorry O
if O
that O
's O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

In O
museums O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
throw O
a O
suitcase O
. O

Director O
- O
General O
, O
only O
today O
, O
on O
my O
way O
back O
from O
a O
shift O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
look O
with O
the O
slightest O
reassurance O
at O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
saw O
me O
unwittingly O
featured O
on O
his O
paper O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
have O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
'm O
afraid O
to O
be O
recognized O
in O
the O
headline O
effect O
, O
" O
You O
're O
going O
to O
eat O
the O
museums O
, O
" O
in O
which O
she O
wanted O
to O
present O
my O
talk O
, O
by O
putting O
a O
name O
to O
an O
article O
in O
which O
, O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
the O
discussion O
about O
ideas O
and O
principles O
, O
I O
had O
been O
very O
careful O
not O
to O
do O
so O
. O

So O
the O
speech O
itself O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
kind O
of O
pre O
- O
election O
satire O
, O
in O
a O
style O
that O
is O
nevertheless O
completely O
alien O
from O
the O
intentions O
, O
interests O
and O
way O
in O
which O
the O
writer O
operates O
. O

Equally O
unnecessary O
emphasis O
is O
found O
in O
the O
six O
- O
column O
review O
the O
following O
day O
. O

Kezich B-PER
remains O
just O
... O
" O
-- O
which O
leaves O
things O
completely O
simple O
. O

for O
its O
perenniality O
certainly O
deserves O
a O
better O
cause O
and O
for O
the O
precipitousness O
with O
which O
it O
sought O
to O
close O
a O
more O
than O
legitimate O
civil O
debate O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
's O
also O
useful O
, O
given O
the O
scarce O
and O
indeed O
scarce O
information O
circulating O
even O
among O
those O
involved O
in O
the O
work O
on O
this O
particular O
aspect O
of O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
's O
legislative O
project O
. O

To O
my O
colleagues O
Lanzinger B-PER
and O
Calì B-PER
, O
and O
many O
others O
who O
eventually O
misunderstood O
, O
I O
replied O
that O
I O
never O
wrote O
or O
argued O
that O
coordination O
between O
museums O
was O
necessary O
. O

In O
fact O
. O

What O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
, O
though O
, O
is O
why O
has O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
already O
having O
all O
the O
legislative O

tools O
at O

coordinate O
all O
of O
its O
satellite O
cultural O
entities O
, O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
and O
in O
a O
totally O
pathetic O
way O
, O
increasingly O
refused O
to O
do O
so O
? O

Rather O
, O
they O
preferred O
to O
reframe O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
museum O
network O
as O
a O
future O
institutional O
redesign O
of O
the O
sector O
, O
which O
is O
neither O
urgent O
nor O
practically O
feasible O
, O
and O
which O
is O
heavily O
questioned O
in O
terms O
of O
content O

who O
's O
talking O
to O
the O

-- O
at O

in O
relation O
to O
assisted O

-- O
the O
worst O
sort O
of O

ever O
passed O
in O

Perhaps O
similar O

could O
be O
asked O
of O
the O
honorable O
Kessler B-PER

Olivieri B-PER

That O
is O
, O
those O
who O
-- O
progressives O
-- O
in O
the O
area O
of O

should O
make O
progressive O

with O

as O

after O

without O

I O
went O
to O
your O

Just O
for O
a O
look O
and O
a O
word O
. O

How O
sad O
. O

closer O
to O
a O

cold O
, O
like O
a O

, O

It O
divided O

like O
the O

symbolic O
of O

My O

And O
it O
was O
running O
like O
a O

with O
ever O

increasing O

But O
you O
did O

come O

my O
little O

you O
could O
n't O
. O

in O
poison O
you O
lose O
. O

Your O
innocent O
mind O
, O

freaked O
out O
, O
by O
unconscious O
people O

I O
was O
leaving O
you O
with O
a O

in O
the O

that O
with O

so O
do O

hold O
back O

" O

You O
were O
hiding O

like O
in O
a O

without O

. O

Your O
smile O
was O
far O
away O
. O

and O
they O
're O
sweating O

I O
was O
slowly O
moving O
away O

But O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
go O
back O

With O
the O
Father O

with O

There O
will O

no O

're O
going O

How O
much O
violence O
? O

in O
healthy O
families O

I O
'm O
referring O
to O
a O
letter O
by O
Francesca B-PER
Agnoli I-PER
, O
published O
on O
October O
8th O
, O
complaining O
about O
the O
danger O
of O
recognition O
of O
same O
- O
sex O
couples O
, O
especially O
if O
that O
precludes O
the O
possibility O
of O
adoption O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
remind O
you O
that O
marriage O
, O
beyond O
the O
sacredness O
of O
what O
it O
has O
been O
shrouded O
in O
throughout O
history O
, O
has O
been O
and O
remains O
essentially O
a O
contract O
. O

To O
be O
able O
to O
freely O
enter O
into O
a O
contract O
with O
legal O
value O
seems O
to O
me O
to O
be O
a O
right O
of O
everyone O
. O

As O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
only O
a O
traditional O
family O
is O
an O
environment O
conducive O
to O
healthy O
and O
psychologically O
balanced O
growth O
, O
that O
's O
just O
the O
stereotype O
. O

I O
invite O
the O
good O
lady O
to O
read O
the O
reports O
from O
the O
Blue B-ORG
Phone I-ORG
, O
the O
data O
from O
domestic O
violence O
, O
or O
even O
, O
quite O
simply O
, O
the O
daily O
news O
reports O
, O
which O
record O
, O
at O
a O
staggering O
rate O
, O
atrocities O
committed O
within O
seemingly O
healthy O
and O
balanced O
families O
. O

I O
find O
it O
offensive O
to O
hear O
the O
gentlemen O
say O
that O
all O
parents O
, O
whether O
adoptive O
or O
otherwise O
, O
have O
been O
made O
to O
do O
so O
with O
the O
help O
of O
medicine O
, O
" O
deemed O
free O
to O
order O
their O
children O
into O
a O
foster O
home O
, O
as O
you O
do O
with O
a O
companion O
dog O
, O
and O
then O
raise O
a O
child O
who O
is O
not O
their O
own O
, O
who O
does O
not O
recognize O
a O
common O
genetic O
heritage O
... O
" O

She O
then O
goes O
on O
to O
make O
a O
mockery O
of O
the O
idea O
that O
" O
women O
are O
encouraged O
, O
with O
an O
appropriate O
self O
- O
insemination O
kit O
and O
a O
sperm O
- O
containing O
syringe O
distributed O
by O
the O
Arciles B-ORG
, O
to O
have O
their O
own O
children O
at O
home O
. O
" O

Indeed O
, O
women O
have O
been O
having O
children O
on O
their O
own O
for O
centuries O
. O

Until O
recently O
, O
a O
hypocritical O
morality O
had O
stigmatized O
them O
. O

Well O
, O
they O
were O
called O
girls O
-- O
mothers O
, O
often O
with O
bad O
rape O
. O

The O
new O
thing O
that O
the O
nice O
lady O
condemns O
is O
the O
idea O
that O
women O
can O
deliberately O
choose O
to O
have O
children O
" O
on O
their O
own O
. O
" O

But O
this O
is O
something O
that O
nature O
, O
as O
the O
good O
lady O
says O
, O
allows O
very O
well O
. O

I O
suppose O
the O
lady O
, O
when O
she O
wrote O
, O
that O
" O
nature O
clearly O
requires O
that O
man O
be O
born O
in O
a O
certain O
way O
, O
without O
artificial O
manipulation O
and O
coercion O
, O
" O
meant O
condemning O
all O
surgeries O
, O
transplants O
, O
artificial O
valves O
, O
transfusions O
, O
perhaps O
even O
medicines O
, O
and O
so O
on O
, O
as O
artificial O
manipulation O
and O
coercion O
that O
counteracts O
the O
natural O
course O
of O
things O
. O

A O
reasoned O
" O
no O
" O

in O
the O
Koran O
at O
school O
. O

The O
members O
of O
Azzurro B-ORG
Donna I-ORG
are O
called O
upon O
to O
reflect O
on O
the O
request O
of O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Muslim O
community O
in O
Trenton B-LOC
for O
the O
introduction O
into O
the O
school O
of O
a O
faculty O
of O
Islamic O
culture O
and O
religion O
now O
run O
by O
Arab O
teachers O
. O

There O
's O
a O
time O
for O
religion O
in O
schools O
, O
which O
is O
not O
mandatory O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
under O
the O
State O
- O
Church O
Concordance O
. O

Italy B-LOC
is O
a O
secular O
state O
, O
but O
all O
of O
Western O
culture O
is O
profoundly O
influenced O
by O
the O
common O
Christian O
matrix O
. O

For O
obvious O
historical O
reasons O
, O
it O
's O
not O
conceivable O
to O
put O
the O
teachings O
of O
the O
Koran O
on O
the O
same O
footing O
. O

Without O
questioning O
ecumenism O
, O
we O
think O
that O
30 O
years O
of O
society O
has O
already O
demonstrated O
acceptance O
, O
respect O
, O
openness O
to O
dialogue O
, O
so O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
fear O
accusations O
of O
closure O
because O
of O
the O
whims O
raised O
by O
the O
request O
of O
imam O
Breigheche B-PER
. O

And O
we O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
lack O
of O
reciprocity O
in O
treatment O
of O
Christian O
communities O
in O
Islamic O
countries O
is O
just O
being O
postponed O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
trade O
- O
off O
. O

The O
question O
is O
much O
more O
complicated O
. O

It O
is O
also O
compelling O
to O
interpret O
this O
demand O
of O
the O
Islamic O
community O
as O
a O
signal O
of O
openness O
or O
a O
willingness O
to O
integrate O
into O
the O
society O
that O
embraces O
it O
. O

The O
imam O
Breigheche B-PER
is O
simply O
doing O
his O
job O
, O
which O
is O
to O
gain O
more O
and O
more O
space O
in O
his O
community O
. O

Full O
freedom O
of O
religion O
and O
belief O
is O
out O
of O
the O
question O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
right O
to O
testify O
and O
to O
convey O
their O
faith O
to O
their O
children O
, O
but O
doing O
so O
in O
schools O
is O
another O
issue O
. O

Especially O
because O
we O
know O
that O
for O
Islam O
, O
religious O
authority O
is O
often O
synonymous O
with O
political O
and O
civil O
authority O
, O
unlike O
Christianity O
. O

That O
's O
the O
crux O
of O
the O
matter O
. O

The O
Koran O
is O
the O
holy O
book O
of O
Islam O
, O
and O
as O
such O
, O
it O
deserves O
all O
our O
respect O
and O
respect O
. O

But O
we O
also O
know O
that O
there O
are O
different O
interpretations O
of O
this O
text O
. O

Without O
stirring O
up O
the O
fury O
of O
those O
most O
fundamentalist O
who O
exhort O
suicide O
bombers O
to O
kill O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
holy O
war O
, O
it O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
in O
Islamic O
countries O
, O
sad O
and O
unacceptable O
realities O
such O
as O
stoning O
, O
infibulation O
, O
segregation O
and O
discrimination O
against O
women O
are O
alive O
. O

We O
can O
not O
ignore O
the O
profound O
conflict O
within O
Islam O
between O
the O
more O
integrated O
and O
the O
more O
moderate O
minds O
, O
but O
we O
certainly O
can O
not O
think O
about O
intervening O
or O
impose O
modes O
of O
teaching O
and O
interpretation O
of O
the O
Koran O
. O

We O
bear O
witness O
to O
our O
values O
of O
liberty O
, O
respect O
for O
the O
person O
, O
tolerance O
and O
equality O
, O
and O
we O
have O
for O
centuries O
left O
the O
crusade O
and O
the O
Inquiry O
behind O
. O

The O
Islamic O
communities O
that O
are O
welcomed O
into O
our O
society O
can O
find O
in O
the O
Western O
world O
a O
valuable O
opportunity O
to O
move O
away O
from O
fundamentalism O
and O
integration O
, O
if O
they O
want O
to O
. O

But O
how O
to O
live O
one O
's O
faith O
remains O
a O
question O
for O
the O
Islamic O
world O
to O
address O
within O
itself O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
and O
then O
by O
dialogue O
and O
confrontation O
outside O
, O
if O
it O
is O
willing O
to O
do O
so O
, O
with O
other O
faiths O
, O
with O
the O
Catholic O
world O
. O

But O
under O
no O
circumstances O
and O
under O
no O
circumstances O
at O
the O
moment O
can O
this O
responsibility O
be O
laid O
down O
on O
our O
school O
system O
, O
which O
can O
not O
and O
must O
not O
become O
the O
interface O
, O
the O
scope O
and O
the O
medium O
for O
managing O
this O
very O
delicate O
issue O

I O
am O
a O
parent O
of O
a O
high O
school O
girl O
and O
a O
first O
- O

. O

Nowadays O
, O
almost O
all O
of O
our O
kids O
have O
gone O
back O
to O
school O
after O
Easter O
. O

I O
call O
them O
" O
nearly O
everyone O
, O
" O
because O
even O
this O
year O
, O
and O
perhaps O
especially O
this O
year O
, O
the O
Easter O
holiday O
calendar O
caused O
a O
lot O
of O
misgiving O
in O
Trent O

I O
think O
I O
'm O
one O
of O
the O
lucky O
ones O
because O
my O
two O

were O
actually O
distributed O

that O
did O

to O
the O
vast O

The O
Passion O
/ O
9 O
: O

faith O
, O
not O
just O
blood O
. O

After O
reading O
the O
newspapers O
and O
listening O
to O
the O
numerous O
talks O
on O
television O
about O
" O
The O
Passion O
, O
" O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
see O
it O
. O

When O
I O
came O
out O
of O
the O
movie O
theater O
, O
I O
had O
in O
me O
, O
besides O
a O
tremendous O
thirst O
for O
crying O
, O
a O
tremendous O
sense O
of O
shame O
for O
the O
many O
words O
that O
were O
used O
about O
the O
violence O
that O
unfolded O
in O
the O
movie O
. O

Words O
of O
condemnation O
, O
words O
that O
scream O
at O
scandal O
, O
words O
that O
invite O
and O
induce O
us O
not O
to O
attend O
. O

It O
's O
undeniable O
that O
violence O
is O
relevant O
in O
the O
film O
, O
but O
only O
those O
who O
do O
n't O
believe O
can O
stop O
it O
. O

The O
scenes O
of O
pain O
find O
meaning O
and O
hope O
in O
the O
constant O
presence O
of O
Mary B-PER
, O
who O
first O
recognizes O
, O
accepts O
and O
sustains O
the O
life O
of O
Jesus B-PER
in O
His O
Passion O
. O

The O
Mother O
's O
suffering O
is O
immense O
, O
but O
somehow O
she O
manages O
to O
keep O
the O
audience O
connected O
to O
love O
and O
to O
heaven O
. O

Also O
beautiful O
is O
the O
figure O
of O
Cyrene O
, O
who O
, O
by O
helping O
Jesus B-PER
to O
carry O
the O
cross O
and O
almost O
embracing O
him O
under O
the O
weight O
that O
he O
shares O
with O
him O
, O
seems O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
human O
being O
who O
also O
knows O
how O
to O
love O
and O
respond O
to O
God B-PER
's O
project O
. O

The O
various O
flashbacks O
that O
intersect O
the O
scenes O
of O
the O
Passion O
also O
recall O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
mission O
and O
the O
message O
of O
Jesus B-PER
, O
and O
then O
end O
up O
spilling O
out O
into O
that O
pain O
that O
remains O
in O
the O
foreground O
, O
but O
that O
becomes O
, O
in O
the O
film O
as O
in O
the O
Truth O
, O
the O
path O
chosen O
by O
our B-PER
Lord I-PER
to O
open O
our O
doors O
to O
life O

and O
who O
kills O
? O

The O
last O
words O
of O
Fabrizio B-PER
Quattrocchi I-PER
are O
among O
those O
auspiciously O
dignified O
expressions O
that O
are O
right O
when O
there O
's O
nothing O
left O
to O
do O
. O

And O
they O
've O
been O
widely O
publicized O
. O

Even O
though O
, O
days O
later O
, O
Italian O
carabinieri O
massacred O
, O
among O
others O
, O
fifteen O
Iraqi O
civilians O
, O
including O
two O
women O
and O
a O
child O
, O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
" O

that O
our O
government O
, O
in O
violation O
of O
the O
Constitution O
, O
is O
limited O
to O
carrying O
out O
. O

Considering O
that O
many O
of O
those O
civilians O
, O
probably O
, O
could O
n't O
speak O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
was O
largely O
and O
definitely O
dark O
. O

We O
now O
expect O
from O
some O
institutional O
representative O

for O
love O
of O
truth O

completeness O
of O
information O

very O
brave O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
do O
that O
by O
asking O
two O
questions O
to O
the O
supporters O
of O
3B. O

First O
question O
. O

If O
the O
coalition O
of O
the O
volunteers O
was O
really O
going O
to O
bring O
democracy O
to O
Iraq B-LOC

how O

to O

the O
Italian O
woman O
Barbara B-PER
Contini I-PER
to O
be O
governor O
of O
Nassirya B-LOC
? O

The O
3Bs O
did O
n't O
let O
us O
know O
. O

One O
. O

the O
foundations O
of O
his O
campaign O
. O

Two O
. O

What O
language O
did O
the O
speaker O
speak O
? O

Three O
. O

where O
, O
how O
and O
when O
he O
informed O
the O
architectures O
of O
his O
programs O
. O

Four O
. O

how O
they O
voted O
for O
it O
. O

because O
they O
ca O
n't O
even O
get O
out O
of O
their O
homes O
. O

a. O

to O
buy O
the O
bread O
. O

b. O

to O
go O
to O

. O

c. O

to O
go O
to O
work O
. O

because O
there O
's O
no O
work O
to O
do O
, O
except O
for O
the O
backseat O
soldiers O
who O
are O
paid O
to O
do O
the O
backseat O
to O
defend O
the O

Second O
question O
. O

Are O
the O
wages O
paid O
to O
the O

the O
wages O
of O
the O
oil O
stolen O
from O

So O
an O

says O
almost O
all O
Italian O
newspapers O
. O

The O
obvious O
intention O
is O
to O
make O
him O
a O

Heroes O
do O

You O
do O
n't O
even O
have O
to O
apologize O
to O

the O

has O
another O

how O

the O
problem O

can O

I O
can O
put O

you O
want O
to O
happen O

Signed O

was O
" O
working O

in O
Iraq O
making O
10 O
or O
100 O
times O

Despite O
the O
high O
costs O
that O
it O
has O
to O
bear O
in O
order O
to O
be O
safe O
. O

" O
Buyed O
" O
was O
the O
title O
of O
a O
movie O
about O
50 O
years O
ago O
. O

That O
would O
be O
the O
proper O
title O
for O
this O
story O
. O

He O
knew O
the O
risk O
, O
he O
chose O
it O
, O
freely O
. O

Freely O
? O

Would O
he O
have O
accepted O
if O
he O
had O
a O
secure O
job O
, O
a O
decent O
wage O
? O

No O
, O
killing O
an O
obstacle O
is O
mean O
, O
as O
well O
as O
politically O
stupid O
. O

But O
equally O
unfortunate O
is O
to O
create O
the O
conditions O
under O
which O
people O
who O
are O
not O
at O
all O
privileged O
can O
accept O
to O
put O
their O
lives O
at O
risk O
in O
that O
way O
. O

It O
's O
even O
harder O
to O
make O
them O
heroes O
to O
hide O
every O
responsibility O

" O

not O

" O
If O

It O

still O
tempting O

perhaps O
to O

it O

not O

what O

what O
function O
they O
have O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
homework O
assignment O
is O
not O
a O
punishment O
or O
a O
sacred O
delight O
for O
the O
teachers O
, O
since O
they O
have O
to O
correct O
what O
the O
students O
do O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
way O
to O
deepen O
and O
internalize O
the O
knowledge O
that O
's O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
in O
the O
little O
time O

also O
to O
the O
education O

In O
any O
activity O

it O
's O
only O
through O
constant O
effort O

that O
good O
results O
are O
achieved O

Nobody O
wonders O
if O
a O

is O
asked O
for O
hours O

hours O
of O
daily O
practice O

Moreover O
, O
the O
tasks O
are O
also O
meant O
to O
empower O
kids O
to O
engage O
and O
fulfill O
a O
commitment O
. O

There O
's O
a O
legitimate O
suspicion O
that O
all O
of O
this O
criticism O
is O
due O
to O
the O
ever O
- O
decreasing O
amount O
of O
time O
that O
parents O
are O
willing O
to O
devote O
to O
their O

to O
tracking O
them O
down O

helping O
them O
study O

and O
to O
the O
low O
level O
of O
consideration O
that O
many O
give O
to O
school O

teachers O
' O
work O

preferring O
TV O

comfortable O
substitutes O

Oftentimes O
families O
do O
n't O
even O
have O
five O
minutes O
to O
justify O
, O
as O
a O
good O
education O
would O
require O
, O
failing O
to O
do O
their O
homework O

Given O
that O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
teachers O
out O
there O
who O
are O
passionately O
engaged O

of O
the O
poor O

who O
receive O
150 O

more O

And O
I O
think O
that O
's O
because O
from O
January O
1 O

2003 O
, O
there O
's O
no O
longer O
a O
two O
percent O

above O
80,392.00 O

That O
means O
that O
, O
for O
example O
, O
people O
who O
were O
receiving O
150 O
million O
lire O
a O
year O
in O

were O
paying O

as O

December O
31 O

, O
a O
three O

lire O
a O

. O

Now O
that O
retiree O
, O
if O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
to O
pay O
that O
tax O
anymore O
, O
he O
's O
going O
to O
have O
three O
million O
pounds O
more O
in O
his O
pocket O

If O
Tremonti B-PER

really O
needed O
money O
because O
, O
instead O
of O
bribing O
ordinary O
workers O
, O
they O
did O

extend O
the O
two O
percent O

above O
150 O

If O
you O
have O
a O

you O
can O

By O
saying O
that O
the O

partial O

therefore O
not O

I O
want O
to O
remind O

that O
it O

enough O

look O

You O
can O
really O
rejoice O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
having O
prompted O
him O
to O
think O
on O
an O
ad O
hoc O
basis O
has O
not O
only O
made O
some O
unnecessary O
flags O
crumple O

but O
it O
has O
, O
above O
all O
, O
increased O
the O
profound O
meaning O
of O
the O
value O
of O
peace O
, O
removing O
him O
from O
serious O
institutional O
use O
for O
political O
ends O

So O
I O
call O
on O
the O
Sisters O
to O
be O
more O
loyal O
and O
more O
tolerant O
to O
those O
who O
allow O
their O
actions O

be O
criticized O

cheated O

The O
Right O
has O
shown O
, O
motivatedly O
, O
the O
true O
meaning O
of O
such O
flags O

it O
's O
always O
done O

respectfully O

constructively O

The O
so O

called O

on O

have O
shown O
, O
particularly O
in O
their O
letters O
to O
the O
Adige B-ORG
, O
how O
much O
resentment O

intolerance O
they O
show O
for O
the O
non O

aligned O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O

just O
because O
they O
had O
the O
courage O
not O

their O
heads O
in O
the O
face O
of O
an O
obvious O
, O

deceptive O

The O

59 O

the O
hours O

following O

The O

to O
him O
when O

a O

he O
realized O
the O
unwavering O
will O

Molinari B-PER

keep O
his O
own O

This O
was O
a O
decision O
that O
put O

out O

the O

would O

reject O

today O

at O
Riva B-ORG

meeting O
the O
next O

the O

it O

the O

the O

the O
most O
important O
. O

The O
voices O
that O
have O
been O
ringing O
in O
the O
last O
few O
hours O
have O
indicated O
that O
Tanas B-PER
is O
an O
authoritative O

if O
not O
the O
most O
authoritative O

candidate O

at O

politically O
-- O
for O
one O
of O
the O
presidentships O

a O

that O

inevitably O
open O
up O

it O
's O
a O
very O
uncomfortable O
place O

But O
in O
this O
sense O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
even O
believe O
in O

today O
, O
except O
by O

If O
Tanas B-PER
takes O
a O
step O
back O

Margherita B-ORG
finally O
confirms O

is O
sovereign O
-- O
commented O
Molinari B-PER
, O
who O
has O
defended O
himself O
with O
specific O
expertise O
-- O
but O
I O
personally O
think O
it O
's O
more O
productive O
to O
have O
a O
constant O
flow O
of O
information O
at O
the O
conference O
headquarters O
. O
" O

We O
're O
not O
putting O
our O
hands O
on O
it O
, O
but O
thinking O
about O
a O
confirmation O
of O
the O
commission O
seems O
unrealistic O
. O

So O
here O
's O
the O
gang O
, O
here O
's O
the O
government O
team O
that O
's O
going O
to O
guide O
Riva B-LOC
's O
choices O
and O
development O
over O
the O
next O
five O
years O
. O

It O
's O
strongly O
centered O
, O
with O
a O
deputy O
like O
Mosaner B-PER
strong O
but O
seemingly O
isolated O
. O

Trusted O
men O
, O
in O
a O
few O
words O
, O
of O
very O
few O
exiles O
, O
who O
had O
never O
before O
gone O
to O
the O
ward O
of O
their O
enemy O
. O

But O
from O
the O
birth O
and O
composition O
of O
this O
community O
also O
comes O
a O
political O
consideration O
that O
's O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
Margherita B-ORG
. O

Today O
, O
like O
today O
, O
with O
Tanas B-PER
out O
of O
office O
and O
the O
former O
leadership O
of O
the O
Valandro B-PER
group O
only O
getting O
confirmation O
from O
the O
youth O
policy O
delegation O
, O
the O
Socialist O
branch O
of O
the O
Rwandan O
civil O
society O
is O
coming O
out O
of O
it O
in O
an O
objectively O
distorted O
way O
, O
almost O
frustrated O
with O
its O
aspirations O
. O

That O
wing O
that O
earlier O
and O
more O
than O
others O
had O
broken O
with O
the O
dissidents O
led O
by O
Pietro B-PER
Matteotti I-PER
. O

Those O
dissidents O
, O
with O
the O
same O
former O
vice O
- O
president O
in O
their O
head O
, O
who O
never O
concealed O
their O
desire O
to O
be O
" O
big O
center O
" O
and O
to O
come O
back O
to O
a O
different O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
comforted O
by O
the O
promises O
that O
someone O
had O
made O
to O
them O
. O

Now O
, O
there O
's O
a O
counterintuitive O
signal O
coming O
out O
of O
this O
. O

But O
today O
is O
today O
. O

And O
tomorrow O
is O
another O
day O
. O

No O

No O

according O
to O

Bruno B-PER
Giardina I-PER

backed O
up O

went O
through O
the O

in O
a O

act O
-- O
exposed O
all O
of O
the O
contradictions O
to O
which O
he O
thought O
the O
court O
had O
fallen O
. O

According O
to O
the O
indictment O
, O
the O
conviction O
should O
have O
been O
much O
more O
severe O

Giardina B-PER
also O
criticizes O
the O
prosecution O

treatment O
of O
the O
accused O
, O
noting O
that O
Isabella B-PER
" O
had O
acted O
falsely O

reluctantly O
on O
a O
number O
of O
occasions O
, O
" O
and O
that O
, O
" O
after O
she O
told O
a O
lot O

, O
when O
she O
decided O
to O
speak O
, O
she O
did O
nothing O
but O
throw O
away O
all O
responsibility O
for O
the O
fact O

" O

Eventually O
, O
the O
process O
was O
repaired O
behind O
the O
protective O
screen O
of O
self O

declarations O
. O

So O
for O
the O
P.M. O
, O
the O
defendant O
does O
n't O
deserve O
any O
discounts O
, O
and O
for O
that O
reason O
, O
the O
judges O
would O
have O
to O
give O
generic O
dissuasives O

the O
age O

The O
most O

season O

history O
goes O
from O
1891 O
to O
1897 O

years O

evolution O

span O
over O
the O
canons O

with O

it O
goes O
from O
the O

from O
the O

most O
extensively O
during O

moves O
away O
from O

itself O

within O

short O
time O
it O
adopts O
a O
brilliant O
palette O

a O
painting O
space O

is O
made O
through O

still O
only O
until O

, O
in O
the O
isolation O

far O
from O
what O
he O
called O
" O
the O
ephemeral O

" O

Nature O
is O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
inspiration O
, O
a O
nature O
that O
is O
not O
the O
heroic O
one O
that O
Segantini B-PER
portrayed O
, O
from O
which O
he O
embraced O
the O
lesson O
without O

being O
enslaved O
by O

vision O

tribute O

Segantini B-PER

are O
breathtaking O
works O
in O
which O
often O
the O
acid O
colors O
give O
back O
the O
faint O
mountain O

without O
being O
true O
to O
the O

ones O

There O
is O
no O

reminiscent O
references O

the O
swaggering O
notion O

great O
loneliness O

gets O
in O
touch O
with O
Segantini B-PER

thanks O
to O
Grubicy B-PER

talk O

was O

in O

although O
rich O

an O
academic O
background O
that O
Segantini B-PER
did O
not O
have O
and O
open O
to O
a O
modernist O
view O
of O
French O
ancestry O

approached O
the O

a O
non O

almost O
psychological O

way O

confrontation O

him O

less O
than O
a O
year O
after O

going O

be O
even O
harder O
for O
him O
to O
get O
away O
from O
the O

Of O
course O
, O
when O
I O
read O
in O
this O
newspaper O
that O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
Dellai B-PER
, O
is O
looking O
with O
interest O
at O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
political O
landscape O
, O
and O
in O
particular O
at O
what O
's O
happening O
in O
the O
Center O
and O
Patt B-ORG
, O
my O
memory O
can O
not O
help O
but O
go O
back O
to O
the O
last O
congress O
of O
the O
PPC B-ORG
, O
held O
eighteen O
months O
ago O
. O

So O
I O
was O
defeated O
because O
I O
advocated O
that O
the O
current O
majority O
, O
if O
it O
really O
wanted O
to O
pursue O
a O
policy O
of O
reform O
, O
it O
had O
to O
reunite O
with O
the O
center O
of O
Valduga B-PER
Giovanazzi B-PER
and O
Conci B-PER
and O
it O
had O
to O
re O
- O
establish O
an O
organic O
, O
strategic O
alliance O
with O
the O
Patt B-ORG
. O

I O
was O
directly O
, O
grossly O
, O
accused O
by O
Betta B-PER
, O
now O
a O
Republican B-LOC
senator O
, O
and O
indirectly O
, O
by O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Dellai O
Provincial B-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
of O
being O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
coup O
, O
comparing O
myself O
to O
the O
worst O
in O
the O
political O
landscape O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
, O
I O
was O
accused O
of O
wanting O
to O
keep O
the O
P.P. B-ORG
alive O
instead O
of O
focusing O
on O
liquidating O
it O
to O
bring O
Margherita B-ORG
to O
life O
. O

And O
now O
, O
in O
Rome B-LOC
, O
those O
who O
supported O
this O
thesis O
have O
" O
closed O
" O
with O
the O
National O
Margin B-ORG
to O
create O
an O
autonomous O
group O
of O
any O
senator O
in O
the O
name O
of O
preserving O
autonomy O
. O

But O
autonomy O
is O
saved O
, O
if O
you O
believe O
it O
, O
by O
big O
reshuffles O
, O
and O
not O
necessarily O
by O
seven O
or O
eight O
senators O
. O

And O
on O
that O
occasion O
, O
finally O
, O
he O
complained O
to O
the O
four O
- O
and O
- O
a O
- O
half O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
people O
there O
would O
never O
touch O
him O
and O
that O
he O
would O
finish O
the O
legislature O
brilliantly O
. O

And O
yet O
it O
did O
n't O
take O
long O
for O
us O
to O
understand O
that O
without O
a O
majority O
in O
the O
legislative O
committees O
, O
without O
numbers O
in O
the O
provincial B-ORG
councils I-ORG
, O
and O
with O
a O
political O
climate O
of O
opposition O
and O
majority O
that O
responds O
, O
in O
some O
ways O
understandably O
, O
to O
the O
violence O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
parliamentary O
term O
, O
and O
without O
political O
forces O
capable O
of O
independently O
seeking O
progressive O
re O
- O
election O
, O
it O
became O
a O
nightmare O
to O
think O
of O
a O
government O
that O
was O
capable O
of O
leading O
a O
reformist O
march O
. O

Now O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Youth I-ORG
and O
leader O
of O
Margherita B-ORG
nostrana O
, O
as O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
journalistic O
interpretations O
, O
is O
aware O
of O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
Center O
and O
what O
remains O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
after O
the O
outbreak O
of O
this O
party O
, O
thanks O
also O
to O
his O
initiative O
, O
with O
the O
invention O
of O
the O
Genziane B-ORG
. O

Late O
than O
ever O
, O
he O
recites O
an O
old O
adage O
. O

But O
is O
this O
rethinking O
necessary O
to O
reframe O
a O
political O
picture O
, O
or O
is O
it O
necessary O
to O
resolve O
some O
personal O
issues O
, O
or O
, O
again O
, O
is O
it O
simply O
necessary O
for O
Dellai B-PER
to O
stay O
on O
top O
of O
his O
job O
and O
to O
secure O
a O
re O
- O
election O
for O
which O
leader O
of O
the O
outgoing O
coalition O
? O

Probably O
the O
truth O
is O
it O
's O
a O
marshmallow O
that O
contains O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
everything O
. O

But O
whatever O
the O
turn O
of O
this O
path O
is O
, O
it O
's O
all O
too O
clear O
that O
the O
crisis O

is O
deeper O
, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
a O
big O
mistake O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
future O
fortunes O
of O
the O
center O
- O
left O
, O
to O
confine O
it O
to O
the O
very O
base B-ORG
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
go O
back O
to O
the O
parties O
, O

The O
task O
of O
redesigning O
a O
path O
for O
the O
future O
of O
this O
country O
is O
very O
unlikely O
to O
be O
able O
to O
respond O
to O
the O
current O
political O
crisis O
. O

The O
risk O
is O
that O
it O
's O
all O
going O
to O
be O
a O
matter O
of O
numbers O
and O
then O
a O
kind O
of O
market O
for O
consultants O
. O

And O
the O
even O
bigger O
risk O
is O
that O
, O
if O
you O
do O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
rhetoric O
, O
you O
're O
going O
to O
solve O
the O
political O
crisis O
by O
simply O
giving O
a O
numerical O
answer O
. O

And O
you O
ca O
n't O
even O
-- O
especially O
for O
people O
and O
parties O
who O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
kind O
of O
mixing O
-- O
forget O
what O
happened O
in O
those O
years O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
there O
are O
some O
headlines O
that O
are O
going O
to O
go O
further O
. O

Who O
has O
worked O
for O
the O
destruction O
of O
parties O
, O
who O
has O
preached O
the O
primacy O
of O
the O
new O
for O
the O
new O
, O
who O
considers O
the O
only O
holder O
of O
power O
, O
regardless O
of O
the O
process O
that O
determines O
it O
, O
the O
institutional O
data O
, O
who O
has O
made O
the O
generational O
belief O
a O
political O
data O
, O
who O
has O
interpreted O
, O
even O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
management O
of O
power O
, O
all O
of O
this O
, O
can O
be O
the O
future O
interpreter O
of O
a O
political O
phase O
that O
will O
have O
to O
be O
based O
on O
a O
re O
- O
election O
of O
the O
role O
and O
function O
of O
parties O
? O

And O
are O
those O
political O
forces O
, O
especially O
those O
of O
the O
center O
, O
that O
today O
are O
interested O
or O
driven O
or O
attracted O
by O
the O
experience O
of O
government O
undermining O
or O
strengthening O
the O
role O
that O
they O
could O
play O
in O
the O
future O
? O

It O
's O
more O
useful O
, O
electorally O
, O
considering O
the O
national O
wave O
, O
to O
be O
homogeneized O
from O
the O
current O
leadership O
, O
or O
it O
might O
be O
more O
useful O
to O
work O
on O
a O
provincial O
political O
establishment O
that O
gives O
the O
political O
forces O
their O
autonomy O
, O
their O
dignity O
, O
even O
within O
a O
coalition O
, O
and O
therefore O
their O
ability O
to O
play O
a O
less O
biased O
role O
. O

It O
's O
clear O
that O
legitimate O
personal O
ambition O
comes O
into O
play O
here O
as O
well O
, O
but O
a O
party O
that O
's O
steadily O
growing O
and O
has O
the O
capacity O
to O
persuade O
, O
should O
make O
a O
less O
contingency O
- O
driven O
design O
more O
prevalent O
, O
even O
though O
it O
does O
n't O
necessarily O
represent O
a O
resource O
. O

It O
can O
be O
a O
problem O
. O

And O
then O
on O
the O
rug O
is O
a O
broader O
discourse O
about O
the O
strategy O
, O
coupled O
of O
course O
with O
the O
content O
, O
that O
the O
center O
- O
left O
is O
going O
to O
have O
to O
develop O
in O
order O
to O
resist O
the O
attack O
of O
the O
center O
- O
right O
. O

It O
's O
a O
question O
that O
's O
not O
easy O
to O
answer O
, O
but O
if O
there O
's O
any O
chance O
of O
success O
, O
it O
's O
that O
it O
's O
rooted O
in O
the O
emergence O
of O
political O
forces O
, O
it O
's O
rooted O
in O
the O
emergence O
of O
certain O
threads O
that O
have O
been O
the O
benchmarks O
for O
thousands O
of O
people O
and O
that O
somebody O
has O
broken O
with O
too O
much O
superficiality O
and O
cynicism O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
national O
and O
local O
political O
and O
institutional O
landscape O
has O
changed O
profoundly O
in O
these O
years O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
true O
that O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
this O
land O
have O
all O
emigrated O
to O
the O
Maldives B-LOC
, O
and O
it O
's O
not O
even O
true O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
has O
been O
invaded O
or O
occupied O
by O
aliens O
who O
have O
imposed O
a O
new O
way O
of O
being O
and O
thinking O
. O

Now O
, O
after O
the O
times O
of O
neo O
- O
conservatism O
at O
all O
costs O
-- O
but O
for O
those O
who O
have O
made O
neo O
- O
conservatism O
an O
ideology O
, O
too O
, O
time O
should O
pass O
-- O
we O
need O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the O
hard O
work O
of O
restoring O
political O
taste O
based O
on O
a O
proper O
separation O
, O
which O
does O
n't O
mean O
inequality O
, O
between O
political O
engagement O
in O
parties O
, O
movements O
in O
associations O
and O
political O
engagement O
in O
institutions O
. O

It O
will O
come O
to O
pass O
that O
confusion O
is O
never O
helpful O
in O
consolidating O
a O
failed O
participatory O
democracy O
, O
but O
it O
is O
shortcuts O
behind O
which O
only O

you O
can O

I O
wonder O
if O
even O
the O

But O
I O
want O
to O
strongly O
deny O
the O
repeated O
and O
overblown O
accusations O
of O
unacceptable O
and O
flagrant O
injustice O
that O

make O
themselves O
guilty O

as O
well O
as O
denying O
that O
their O

are O
lower O
than O
those O
of O
other O

, O
just O
because O
their O
working O

are O
distributed O
differently O
, O
as O
well O
as O
denying O
all O
the O
hateful O
wrath O
that O
continues O
to O
be O
expressed O
by O
many O
students O
( O
and O
often O
even O
parents O
) O

not O
to O
mention O
public O
opinion O

against O
the O

In O
every O
context O
of O
human O
society O
, O
there O
are O
honest O
people O
and O
dishonest O
people O
, O
hardworking O

skilled O
and O
correct O
workers O
in O
front O
of O
hardworking O
, O
unskilled O
, O
unintelligent O
and O
opportunistic O
workers O
. O

In O
a O
very O
delicate O
field O
of O
teaching O
, O
the O
teaching O
of O
the O
necessary O
concepts O
should O
be O
accompanied O
by O
an O
educational O
function O
, O
which O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
lip O
service O
, O
but O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
today O
's O
pervasive O
permissiveness O
. O

No O
one O
's O
infallible O
, O
some O
grades O
can O
go O
wrong O
, O
some O
unscrupulous O
teachers O
can O
commit O
favoritism O
. O

that O
does O
n't O
justify O
the O
ridiculous O
and O
ludicrous O
claims O
that O
students O
and O
their O
families O
are O
systematically O
and O
ruthlessly O
bullying O
the O
classroom O
. O

Maybe O
even O
in O
school O
, O
if O
you O
had O
a O
little O
less O
laziness O
and O
a O
little O
more O
commitment O
, O
if O
you O
had O
a O
little O
less O
playfulness O
. O

And O
if O
young O
people O
were O
encouraged O
to O
take O
a O
more O
serious O
approach O
, O
if O
a O
little O
less O
blatantly O
innovative O
legislation O
were O
invented O
, O
if O
the O
TARs O
were O
a O
little O
less O
indulgent O
and O
spread O
at O
all O
levels O
a O
little O
more O
balanced O
, O
we O
would O
have O
a O
smaller O
explosion O
of O
pseudo O
- O
idealized O
violence O
, O
less O
aggression O
and O
more O
respect O
for O
each O
other O
. O

And O
maybe O
that O
's O
what O
true O
, O
authentic O
education O
is O
all O
about O

the O

demands O
a O
serious O
study O
of O
the O

of O
this O

It O
's O
also O
appropriate O
that O
a O
public O

which O
gives O
guarantees O

the O

" O

" O
It O
is O
in O
this O
picture O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
" O
that O
the O
goal O
is O
to O
increase O
cooperation O
between O
bodies O

become O
more O
of O

" O

And O
specifically O
, O
the O
head O
of O

underlined O
" O
the O
intentions O
for O
a O
more O
fruitful O
cross O

cooperation O
between O
the O
two O
provinces O
of O
Upper B-LOC
Austria I-LOC

" O

It O
is O
within O
this O
European O
, O
cross O

border O
context O
that O
, O
according O
to O
Ciampi B-PER
, O
tensions O
between O
different O
ethnic O
and O
linguistic O
groups O
can O
also O
be O
overcome O
. O

It O
's O
precisely O
because O
Italians O
in O
Bolzano B-LOC
do O
n't O
have O
to O
risk O
feeling O
like O
a O
minority O
in O
a O
foreign O
state O
, O
or O
German O
- O
speaking O
minorities O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
see O
their O

" O
Some O
separations O
, O
which O
could O
be O
justified O
in O

to O
overcome O
conflict O
situations O
, O
risk O
becoming O
equally O
obstacles O
to O
the O
progress O
of O
all O

This O
is O
the O
time O
to O
move O
beyond O
the O
phase O
of O
" O
separate O
at O

, O
" O
to O
the O
phase O
of O
" O
peaceful O
coexistence O
" O
between O
different O

groups O
in O
the O

region O
. O
" O

Finally O
, O
one O
last O
call O
. O

Ciampi B-PER
has O
blessed O
this O
new O
phase O
of O
autonomy O
, O
supported O
by O
the O
new O
Bolzano B-LOC
line O
-- O
Durnwalder B-PER
and O
Dellai B-PER
trains O
. O

But O
he O
wanted O
to O
make O
two O
warnings O
. O

The O
first O
is O
not O
to O
extend O
the O
bodies O
of O
public O
administration O
too O
much O
. O

That O
's O
like O
saying O
: O

careful O
not O
to O
unnecessarily O
multiply O
public O
spending O
, O
creating O
flawed O
bureaucratic O
apparatus O
, O
which O
the O
two O
provinces O
and O
the O
same O
region B-LOC
are O
not O
immune O
to O
. O

And O
the O
other O
warning O
is O
that O
the O
new O
phase O
of O
autonomy O
gives O
way O
to O
civil O
society O
. O

That O
is O
, O
in O
the O
words O
of O
Ciampi B-PER
, O
" O
a O
space O
for O
the O
private O
sector O
's O
energy O
, O
enabling O
it O
to O
perform O
functions O
that O
the O
public O
sector O
sometimes O
tends O
to O
neglect O
, O
at O
the O
risk O
of O
overregulating O
. O
" O

Nothing O
to O
stop O
the O
Third O
Reich O
from O
Rome B-LOC
, O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
hill O
, O
has O
come O
. O

Now O
it O
's O
up O
to O
the O
30 O
- O
something O
politician O
, O
the O
high O
- O
ranking O
politician O
, O
to O
take O
on O
the O
burden O
of O
delivering O
the O
goods O
of O
the O
Head O
of O
State O
. O

And O
now O
, O
after O
we O
've O
done O
the O
final O
burial O
of O
the O
old O
region B-LOC
, O
there O
are O
no O
more O
