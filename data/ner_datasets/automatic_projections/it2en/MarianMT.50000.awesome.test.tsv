Last O

Zapatero B-PER
obtained O

authorization O

open O
a O
dialogue O

the O
ETA B-ORG
if O
it O
renounced O

and O
the O
Prime O

undertook O

the O

that O

According O
to O
the O
observers O
, O
after O
going O
to O
Parliament O

Zapatero B-PER
will O
begin O
contact O

may O
decide O
to O
bring O

their O
region O

one O
of O
the O

But O

questioned O
by O

the O
Prime O

did O
not O
confirm O

deny O
it O
by O
stressing O
that O
" O
every O

that O
the O

can O
make O
must O
be O
comforted O
by O
the O
support O
of O

the O
certainty O
of O
the O
end O

Yesterday O

that O

As O
for O

Brutti B-PER

did O

It O

even O

at O

those O
of O

instead O
, O
we O

even O

the O
Report O

had O
multiple O
tasks O
: O

It O
had O
to O
remain O
in O
the O
turret O
, O
facing O
north O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
top O
of O
the O
ramp O
towards O
the O
incoming O
traffic O
. O

From O
there O
he O
had O
to O
operate O
a O
handheld O
torch O
with O
high O
potential O
from O
three O
million O
candles O
, O
which O
he O
had O
to O
light O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
approaching O
vehicles O
. O

If O
the O
light O
signals O
were O
found O
to O
be O
ineffective O
, O
he O
should O
have O
fired O
warning O
shots O
targeting O
the O
left O
of O
the O
vehicle O
that O
was O
running O
the O
ramp O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
if O
the O
vehicle O
had O
continued O
to O
approach O
, O
it O
would O
have O
had O
to O
rearrange O
the O
weapon O
and O
use O
it O
to O
disable O
the O
vehicle O
, O
aiming O
at O
the O
engine O
and O
the O
wheels O
. O

Finally O
, O
if O
the O
vehicle O
had O
not O
yet O
stopped O
, O
it O
would O
have O
had O
to O
continue O
to O
shoot O
to O
hire O
the O

Only O
5 O
days O

That O
evening O
, O
therefore O
, O
Lozano B-PER
was O
on O
the O

when O
the O
Toyota O

led O
by O

approached O
the O

at O
a O
speed O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
various O
testimonies O
of O
the O
American O
military O
, O
varied O
from O
50 O
to O
80 O
miles O
per O
hour O
. O

Testimonials O
that O
, O
emphasizes O
the O
report O
, O
seem O
spoiled O
by O
emotional O
factors O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
machine O
gunner O
felt O
threatened O
and O
said O
he O
had O
thought O
of O
the O
daughters O
in O
while O
he O
frantically O
counted O
the O
seconds O
, O
observed O
the O
space O
traveled O
by O
the O
car O

carried O
out O
the O
mathematical O
operations O
necessary O
to O
calculate O
the O
speed O
of O
the O
vehicle O
approaching O
inexorable O
, O
screaming O
to O
rip O
, O
but O
no O
other O
soldier O
heard O
the O
shouts O
to O
make O
himself O
heard O
by O
the O
driver O
of O
the O
Toyota O
, O
operated O
with O
his O
right O
hand O
warning O
shots O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
lawn O
to O
his O
left O
, O
threw O
away O
the O
lamp O
while O
changing O
the O
lighting O
conditions O
of O
the O
ramp O
with O
both O
hands O
, O
turned O
it O
towards O
the O
car O
now O
at O
a O
distance O
too O
close O
for O
a O
suspected O
car O
bomb O
, O
aimed O
and O
shot O
ahead O
of O
the O
car O
to O
try O
to O
hit O
engine O

All O
- O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
- O
in O
a O
handful O
of O
seconds O

And O
so O
the O
gunner O
fired O
at O

two O
close O
bursts O
. O

The O
11 O
7.62 O
caliber O
bullets O
that O

the O

A O
determined O
execution O
to O
punish O
the O
girl O
of O
her O
choice O
to O
live O
in O
the O
West O

rebelling O
against O
the O
rigid O
impositions O

the O
wishes O
of O
her O

who O
for O
her O

" O
We O
hope O
to O
catch O
the O
third O
of O
Hina B-PER

assassins O
soon O
, O
" O
said O
the O
magistrate O
. O

The O
heinous O
crime O
, O
said O
Tarquini B-PER
, O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
punishment O
inflicted O
by O
the O
father O
to O
a O
daughter O
who O
had O
not O
respected O
the O
rules O
of O
ethnicity O
and O
Pakistani O
culture O
. O

These O
are O
cruelty O
that O
sometimes O
arise O
also O
from O
religious O
beliefs O
or O
beliefs O
that O
should O
lead O
to O
anything O
else O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
respect O
for O
life O
. O

I O
think O
that O
Muslim O
religion O
also O
leads O
to O
respect O
for O
life O
, O
and O
not O
to O
the O
opposite O
- O
the O
magistrate O
emphasized O
- O
. O

Those O
who O
commit O
crimes O
in O
the O
name O
of O
religion O
violate O
religion O
itself O
and O
its O
inspiring O
principles O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
Islam O
did O
not O
cause O
this O
tragedy O
. O

However O
, O
its O
incorrect O
reading O
has O
turned O
into O
an O
aberration O
. O

According O
to O
the O
prosecutor O
, O
Hina B-PER
's O
murderers O
are O
his O
father O
Mohamed B-PER
Saleem I-PER
, O
51 O
years O
old O
, O
Uncle O
Mohamad B-PER
Tariq I-PER
, O
50 O
( O
husband O
of O
a O
mother O
's O
sister O
) O
and O
perhaps O
the O
young O
husband O
of O
Hina B-PER
's O
older O
sister O
. O

To O
cut O
the O
throat O
to O
Hina B-PER
would O
be O
the O
father O
, O
with O
the O
full O
collaboration O
of O
the O
other O
two O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
the O
accusation O
is O
identical O
for O
all O
: O

Willful O
premeditated O
murder O
and O
concealment O
of O
corpse O
. O

The O
prosecutor O
has O
long O
considered O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
premeditation O
: O

it O
is O
assumed O
that O
the O
girl O
had O
been O
invited O
home O
with O
the O
deception O
and O
that O
the O
mother O
and O
the O
little O
brothers O
removed O
in O
order O
to O
act O
undisturbed O
. O

The O
relationship O
between O
the O
young O
woman O
and O
the O
father O
has O
not O
been O
good O
for O
years O
. O

He O
could O
n't O
stand O
the O

dressing O
in O

working O
in O
the O
evening O
( O
in O

and O
going O
to O
clubs O

places O

frequented O

Hina B-PER

westernized O
herself O

all O
intents O

purposes O

She O
also O
had O
two O
tattoos O

, O
above O
all O
, O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
know O
about O
a O
marriage O
already O
arranged O
for O
her O
by O
her O
father O
in O
Pakistan B-LOC

It O
remains O
to O
be O
understood O
if O
and O
how O
much O
Saleem B-PER
knew O
of O
the O
relationship O
of O
the O
daughter O
with O
Giuseppe B-PER
Tampini I-PER
, O
the O
33 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
mason O
with O
whom O
the O
girl O
in O

lived O
for O
over O
a O

Since O
the O
day O

the O

last O
Saturday O

the O

The O
heinous O
crime O
has O
also O
shaken O
the O
political O
community O

According O
to O
the O
Minister O
of O

Interior O
Giuliano B-PER
Amato I-PER
" O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Pakistani O
girl O
killed O
by O
her O
father O
teaches O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
citizenship O
, O
because O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
ask O
for O
adherence O
to O
the O
values O
of O
the O
Constitution O
" O
, O
but O
there O
must O
also O
be O
an O
adherence O
to O
fundamental O
rights O
such O
as O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
woman O
respects O
herself O
according O
to O
rules O
that O
I O
consider O
universal O
" O
. O

The O
minister O
then O
added O
that O
a O
right O
to O
be O
considered O
universal O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
woman O
has O
the O
right O
to O
choose O
her O
life O
and O
arranged O
marriage O
we O
have O
abandoned O
it O
a O
few O
centuries O

that O
the O

condemned O

Man O
explains O
that O
Hina B-PER

can O
generate O
hatred O
for O

it O

such O
as O
the O
calculation O
of O

because O
the O
real O
Italian O

the O

in O
particular O
of O
the O

we O
forgot O
that O
this O

the O

We O

certainly O
no O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
today O
the O
municipal O
elections O
in O
Catania B-LOC
could O
be O
marked O
by O
the O
crisis O

because O
after O
four O

we O
do O
not O
understand O
where O
the O
revival O
of O
the O

Only O
now O

after O

the O

talking O
about O

But O
the O
problem O
always O
remains O

Where O
do O
you O
find O
the O
money O

The O
era O

And O
if O
in O
Catania B-LOC
will O
not O
win O
the O
outgoing O

that O

serious O
risk O

Fini B-PER

evident O
that O
the O

In O

on O

were O
eight O

And O
now O
all O
this O
does O
n't O
count O
? O

I O
only O
find O
myself O
in O
this O
situation O
because O
I O
would O
have O

this O

For O

the O

Alfredo B-PER

those O
who O
, O
like O
the O
former O

it O

dangerous O

For O
Isabella B-PER
Bertolini I-PER

the O

good O
news O
: O

Gives O

believe O
that O
the O

the O

ROME B-LOC
- O
An O
attack O
campaign O
against O
the O
left O
, O
even O
harder O
than O
the O
one O
of O
2001 O
: O

Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
proposes O
to O
allies O
his O
eternal O
recipe O
to O
defeat O
Prodi B-PER
and O
remain O
in O
government O
in O
the O
new O
legislature O
. O

His O
political O
analysis O
is O
simple O
: O

Italians O
are O
a O
people O
of O
moderates O
, O
they O
will O
not O
hand O
over O
the O
keys O
of O
power O
to O
a O
coalition O
that O
does O
not O
have O
the O
rag O
of O
a O
program O
. O

To O
the O
regionals O
the O
Cdl B-ORG
has O
lost O
to O
the O
absenteeism O
of O
the O
disappointed O
. O

However O
the O
premier O
realizes O
that O
they O
need O
novelty O
and O
the O
announcement O
of O
a O
shift O
of O
the O
single O
party O
certainly O
does O
not O
calm O
the O
discontented O
, O
Udc B-ORG
and O
An B-ORG
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Today O
we O
will O
see O
how O
the O
Knight O
's O
last O
moves O
at O
the O
Udc B-ORG
Congress O
and O
the O
National O
Assembly O
of O
An B-ORG
will O
be O
evaluated O
: O

The O
impression O
is O
that O
allies O
are O
bent O
on O
themselves O
, O
looking O
for O
an O
electoral O
strategy O
. O

It O
is O
no O
coincidence O
that O
Alemanno B-PER
calls O
for O
An B-ORG
to O
hold O
a O
programmatic O
conference O
within O
the O
year O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
new O
Fiuggi O
as O
a O
condition O
not O
to O
give O
life O
to O
an O
internal O
minority O
( O
and O
it O
would O
be O
the O
first O
time O
that O
Fini B-PER
would O
not O
get O
unanimity O
in O
his O
party O
) O
. O

In O
the O
Udc B-ORG
perhaps O
Giovanardi B-PER
will O
not O
compete O
with O
Follini B-PER
also O
because O
the O
projection O
of O
the O
single O
party O
beyond O
the O
policies O
of O
2006 O
makes O
quite O
surreal O
a O
congressional O
battle O
so O
premature O
. O

But O
Berlusconi B-PER
also O
has O
to O
deal O
with O
two O
other O
problems O
: O

the O
League B-ORG
and O
the O
Socialists B-ORG
. O

The O
first O
, O
as O
Bondi B-PER
acknowledges O
, O
remains O
for O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
a O
vital O
anchor O
and O
this O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
single O
party O
can O
not O
be O
transformed O
into O
a O
path O
against O
Bossi B-PER
: O

So O
it O
needs O
a O
softer O
approach O
. O

As O
for O
the O
socialists O
, O
yesterday O
's O
meeting O
between O
De B-PER
Michelis I-PER
and O
Boselli B-PER
was O
a O
step O
forward O
on O
the O
path O
of O
socialist O
unity O
. O

Although O
with O
all O
the O
cautions O
of O
the O
case O
, O
the O
New B-ORG
Psi I-ORG
seems O
to O
be O
starting O
to O
leave O
the O
Cdl B-ORG
, O
also O
because O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
recognize O
itself O
in O
a O
single O
party O
inspired O
by O
the O
Ppe B-ORG
. O

Of O
course O
, O
De B-PER
Michelis I-PER
continues O
to O
repeat O
that O
the O
operation O
must O
remain O
outside O
of O
the O
existing O
" O
schemes O
" O
, O
but O
once O
the O
Fed B-ORG
has O
set O
the O
socialist O
unity O
seems O
possible O
only O
within O
the O
center O
- O
left O
. O

Boselli B-PER
talks O
about O
encouraging O
talks O
and O
does O
not O
exclude O
a O
subsequent O
enlargement O
of O
the O
agreement O
to O
radicals B-ORG
. O

Against O
the O
risk O
of O
bleeding O
from O
the O
socialist O
area O
, O
Berlusconi B-PER
announced O
that O
he O
will O
run O
for O
Stefania B-PER
Craxi I-PER
in O
a O
secure O
boarding O
school O
in O
Milan B-LOC
. O

Letizia B-PER
Moratti I-PER
will O
run O
for O
the O
mayor O
's O
chair O
instead O
. O

The O
true O
reformist O
socialists O
, O
the O
Knight O
argues O
, O
can O
not O
forget O
what O
the O
left O
has O
done O
to O
Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER

but O

the O

The O

a O

more O

We O

Therefore O

it O

ROME B-LOC
- O
Four O
days O
after O
the O
vote O
, O
a O
strong O
appeal O
to O
the O
dialogue O
on O
reforms O
was O
addressed O
to O
the O
two O
poles O
by O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
Giorgio B-PER
Napolitano I-PER
. O

During O
his O
visit O
to O
Naples B-LOC
, O
the O
Head O
of O
State O
invited O
voters O
to O
come O
to O
the O
polls O
because O
it O
is O
too O
important O
for O
everyone O
to O
decide O
on O
the O
matter O
, O
however O
it O
is O
thought O
. O

However O
, O
Napolitano B-PER
also O
asked O
the O
two O
opposing O
parties O
, O
whatever O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
vote O
, O
to O
bring O
the O
debate O
on O
reforms O
back O
to O
Parliament O
, O
in O
search O
of O
the O
broadest O
consensus O
. O

The O
appeal O
gathers O
consensus O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
; O

especially O
from O
the O
centre O
- O
right O
, O
which O
considers O
it O
particularly O
positive O
because O
it O
accompanies O
the O
other O
invitation O
not O
to O
destroy O
the O
entire O
activity O
of O
the O
Berlusconi O
government O
. O

But O
the O
clash O
between O
the O
two O
poles O
remains O
high O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
umpteenth O
duel O
at O
a O
distance O
between O
Berlusconi B-PER
and O
Prodi B-PER
. O

The O
leader O
of O
the O

launches O
his O
trip O
from O

The O

he O
says O
, O
is O
an O
opportunity O
to O
say O
no O
to O
the O
Prodi O
government O
, O
with O
its O
11 O
communist O

a O

which O
there O
are O

who O
go O

who O
appoint O
former O

Prodi B-PER
answers O
shortly O
after O
from O
Moscow B-LOC
: O

Berlusconi B-PER
, O
says O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
is O
ready O
to O
ruin O
the O
Constitution O
to O
give O
a O
lesson O
to O
a O

does O
not O

Yet O
, O
Napolitano B-PER

intervention O

some O
results O

The O
whole O

said O
to O
be O
ready O
for O
confrontation O
with O
the O
center O

left O
after O
the O

of O
June O
25 O

Sandro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
judges O
it O
as O
an O
important O
and O
courageous O
warning O
" O
, O
Maurizio B-PER
Gasparri I-PER
sees O
us O
almost O
a O
endorsement O
to O
the O
reasons O
for O
the O
yes O

even O
the O
legist O
Roberto B-PER
Calderoli I-PER
, O
usually O
very O
hard O
with O
the O
head O
of O
state O
, O
sets O
aside O
the O
controversy O
and O
says O
yes O
to O
dialogue O
. O

On O
one O
condition O
, O
however O
: O

that O
the O
reform O
is O
approved O
and O
enters O
into O
force O
immediately O
. O

Once O
we O
take O
off O
, O
we O
can O
discuss O
how O
to O
improve O
it O
, O
it O
is O
its O
position O
. O

The O
Union B-ORG
does O
not O
like O
to O
beat O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
centre O
- O
right O
in O
Napolitano B-PER
, O
because O
it O
sees O
it O
as O
an O
instrumentalization O
. O

And O

at O
the O

bubble O
as O
" O
not O
elegant O
" O
is O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
center O
- O
right O
. O

But O
the O
signs O
show O
that O
reforms O
, O
beyond O
the O
outcome O
, O
can O
become O
an O
element O
of O
confrontation O
between O
the O
two O
sides O

few O

on O
the O
failure O
of O

never O

Those O
things O
I O
had O

tell O
you O

and O
they O
took O
effect O

explains O
Bossi B-PER

I O

On O

I O
celebrate O
the O
feast O
of O
all O
Italians O

of O

this O
is O
a O

of O
Liberation O

that O

hit O
Italy B-LOC

from O

which O

to O
fight O

When O
the O
Minister O

made O
it O
into O
the O
crowd O
and O
here O
the O
prepared O
protest O
of O
some O

( O
many O

The O
tension O
has O
risen O
and O
some O
have O
asked O
the O

not O
to O
endanger O
the O

not O

came O
out O
of O
the O

, O
still O
among O
the O

The O
minister O
explained O
, O
however O
, O
that O
she O
did O
not O
abandon O
the O
procession O
but O
that O
she O
had O
come O
to O
accompany O
her O

that O
it O
was O
already O
expected O
that O
in O

of O
the O

she O
would O
end O
her O
participation O

The O
protest O
against O
Letizia B-PER
Moratti I-PER
was O
stigmatized O
almost O
unanimously O
. O

" O

Carlo B-PER
Azeglio I-PER
Ciampi I-PER
wanted O
to O
repeat O
it O
in O
Crotone B-LOC

with O
an O
institutional O
pedagogy O
speech O
that O
contains O
strong O
references O
to O
the O
duties O
of O
the O
southern O
citizens O
and O
the O
spirit O
of O
responsibility O
that O
must O
inspire O
their O
administrators O
. O

The O
speech O
also O
had O
as O
direct O
interlocutors O
the O
schools O
present O
numerous O
and O
participated O
on O
the O
forums O
of O
the O
sports O
hall O
in O
which O
the O
head O
of O
the O
State O
took O
the O
floor O
, O
in O
front O
of O
a O
audience O
of O
mayors O
and O
city O
councilors O
of O
the O
area O
. O

The O
young O
Ciampi B-PER
asked O
essentially O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
two O
things O
: O

the O
good O
fortune O
of O
finally O
living O
in O
a O
Europe B-LOC
of O
peace O
and O
the O
need O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
further O
progress O
. O

Because O
, O
he O
told O
them O
, O
the O
future O
will O
be O
what O
you O
will O
know O
how O
to O
build O
. O

Without O
ever O
mentioning O
the O
word O
federalism O
, O
Ciampi B-PER
said O
: O

" O
United O
Italy B-LOC
has O
a O
duty O
to O
devote O
a O
special O
attention O
to O
the O
less O
developed O
regions O
" O
because O
the O
country O
is O
one O
and O
its O
problems O
are O
problems O
of O
all O
, O
to O
be O
solved O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
all O
. O

But O
this O
does O
not O
mean O
neglecting O
the O
most O
advanced O
regions O
, O
which O
must O
be O
stimulated O
and O
supported O
in O
order O
to O
remain O
competitive O
worldwide O
. O

" O
Italy B-LOC
, O
I O
repeat O
once O
again O
- O
he O
said O
- O
is O
a. O

Its O
problems O
, O
although O
different O
in O
the O
various O
areas O
, O
are O
problems O
of O
all O
and O
it O
is O
the O
advantage O
of O
all O
to O
solve O
each O
of O
them O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
right O
that O
the O
South O
rely O
on O
the O
richest O
North O
; O

that O
the O
central O

To O

not O
that O
we O
need O
to O

too O
much O

Since O
everyone O
had O
been O
waiting O
for O
2006 O
for O
the O
repositioning O
of O
hairpin O
bends O
from O
Montevideo B-LOC

Vason B-LOC
for O

here O
's O
the O
time O
that O

, O
it O
did O
n't O
make O
any O
sense O
at O
all O

But O
making O
it O
pass O
was O
not O
easy O
, O
because O
now O
in O
Milan B-LOC
the O
idea O
that O
circulated O
, O
just O
a O
week O
from O
the O
vernissage O
of O
presentation O
of O
the O
track O
, O
was O
the O
one O
that O
already O
in O
the O
Province B-LOC
had O
confirmed O
: O

only O
a O
passage O
on O
the O
top O
and O
beaten O
towards O
the O
capital O
, O
a O
hypothesis O
that O
had O
understandably O
left O
the O
professionals O
puzzled O
and O
literally O
caused O
the O
" O
bondones O
" O
, O
who O
in O
the O
aftermath O
of O
the O
burning O
discovery O
of O
a O
Bondone B-LOC
in O
a O
minor O
tone O
had O
even O
threatened O
to O
block O
the O
race O
during O
a O
stage O
that O
- O
to O
them O
and O
not O
only O
their O
opinion O
- O
would O
have O
offended O
the O
beloved O
mountain O
instead O
of O
honoring O
it O

But O
all O
this O
is O
now O
part O
of O
a O
past O
that O
has O
been O
denied O
by O
the O
present O

tore O

not O

A O

the O

between O
analysis O
of O
the O

that O

remain O

In O
short O

ironic O
singing O
aside O

it O
will O
really O
be O
a O
great O
nice O

now O
the O
hypotheses O

where O
it O
was O
used O
little O
, O
this O
second O
year O
until O
today O
for O
her O
is O
very O
positive O
. O

The O
first O
year O
was O
a O
year O
of O
psychological O
setting O
in O
the O
difficult O
transition O
from O
regional O
football O
to O
national O
football O
. O

This O
second O
year O
is O
completely O
different O
. O

I O
expected O
to O
make O
a O
nice O
championship O
given O
last O
year O
's O
experience O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
imagine O
being O
designated O
immediately O
in O
races O
of O
all O
respect O
throughout O
the O
national O
territory O

Up O

now O
I O
have O
been O
designated O

almost O

He O
is O
currently O
one O

Do O
you O
expect O
a O
promotion O
to O
the O

shortly O
? O

I O
think O
it O
's O
best O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
necessary O
experience O
is O
needed O
to O
achieve O
certain O
goals O
. O

Usually O
the O
national O
technical O
bodies O
focus O
more O
on O
the O

I O
will O
give O
the O
best O
to O
get O

At O
the O
moment O
I O
believe O
that O

Vincenzo B-PER
Vanacore I-PER

all O

One O
point O
in O
the O
last O
four O
games O
, O
the O
Rovereto B-ORG
is O
going O
through O
a O
delicate O
moment O
after O
having O
played O
last O
year O
a O
championship O
from O
freshman O
over O
the O
lines O

Mr. O
Enzo B-PER
Cuel I-PER
, O
what O
is O
the O
cause O
of O
this O
empty O
passage O
? O

" O
Against O
the O
Comano B-ORG
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
month O
, O
Giovanazzi B-PER
and O
Bortoli B-PER
have O
returned O
, O
and O
even O
the O
Channel O
is O
only O
now O
well O
. O
" O

This O
also O
weighed O
on O
the O
team O
's O
performance O
. O

Nevertheless O
we O
had O
to O
win O
with O
San B-ORG
Giorgio I-ORG
and O
instead O
we O
lost O
, O
against O
the O
Stegona B-ORG
we O
were O
winning O
and O
we O
were O
reached O
. O

Even O
last O
Sunday O
, O
in O
a O
game O
definitely O
not O
beautiful O
, O
we O
built O
3 O
- O
4 O
big O
occasions O
, O
hit O
two O
poles O
and O
lost O
in O
the O
only O
shot O
in O
the O
door O
, O
or O
almost O
, O
of O
our O
opponents O
. O

I O
chose O
to O
be O
able O
to O
play O
without O
Cristoforetti B-PER
in O
the O
door O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
deploy O
the O
strongest O
training O
in O
the O
field O
, O
with O
9 O
experienced O
players O
in O
the O
category O
and O
two O
" O
under O
" O
. O

After O
three O
years O
that O
this O
group O
plays O
together O
how O
do O
you O
explain O
this O
impasse O
? O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
great O
crises O
, O
lately O
we O
have O
played O
some O
games O
a O
little O
subtone O
but O
these O
things O
happen O
in O
football O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
want O
some O
of O
mine O
, O
seeing O
the O
return O
of O
Garniga B-PER
and O
having O
lost O
only O
Sheffer B-PER
, O
which O
was O
still O
an O
important O
pawn O
for O
us O
, O
had O
thought O
that O
we O
were O
high O
ranking O
team O
. O

Bortoli B-PER
scored O
40 O
goals O
in O
two O
leagues O
, O
now O
they O
're O
practically O
4 O
Sundays O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
play O
because O
yesterday O
( O
Sunday O
, O
ed O
) O
he O
went O
on O
the O
field O
only O
thanks O
to O
infiltrations O
. O

It O
is O
time O
and O
time O
for O
the O
most O
experienced O
players O
, O
even O
if O
the O
" O
oldest O
" O
are O
25 O
years O
old O
, O
to O
assume O
their O
responsibilities O
; O

This O
year O
we O
are O
training O
even O
more O
intensely O
than O
last O
championship O
, O
the O
training O
methods O
and O
the O
coach O
are O
always O
the O
same O
. O

Now O
finally O
we O
have O
recovered O
Matté B-PER
, O
which O
can O
give O
quality O
on O
the O
bands O
and O
more O
choice O
at O
the O
center O
. O

In O
light O
of O
the O
many O
goals O
scored O
recently O
, O
will O
he O
insist O
on O
the O
three O
- O
way O
defense O
or O
will O
he O
be O
more O
covered O
? O

The O
defensive O
module O
does O
n't O
have O
anything O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
collect O
too O
many O
networks O
, O
at O
least O
in O
the O
last O
matches O
, O
comes O
exclusively O
from O
individual O
mistakes O
, O
many O
goals O
honestly O
we O
have O
made O
, O
with O
big O
gifts O
to O
the O
opponents O
, O
not O
respecting O
deliveries O
and O
movements O
. O

The O
promising O
Giuliani B-PER
when O
he O
plays O
always O
does O
well O
but O
does O
n't O
play O
much O
, O
why O
? O

Unfortunately O
, O
not O
because O
of O
her O
, O
she O
skipped O
all O
pre O
- O
season O
preparation O
for O
health O
problems O
. O

When O
he O
played O
against O
San B-ORG
Giorgio I-ORG
he O
played O
quite O
well O
but O
then O
Stegona B-LOC
did O
n't O
confirm O
it O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
, O
with O
the O
return O
of O
Bortoli B-PER
and O
Garniga B-PER
, O
with O
Giovanazzi B-PER
in O
support O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
let O
Giuliani B-PER
play O
but O
I O
always O
keep O
it O
in O
consideration O
. O

Will O
you O
ask O
the O
company O
to O
return O
to O
the O
market O
to O
strengthen O
the O
rose O
? O

" O
Absolutely O
not O
, O
society O
has O
made O
a O
clear O
choice O
, O
shared O
by O
me O
: O

We O
will O
not O
go O
on O
the O
market O
, O
given O
the O
response O
of O
a O
city O
like O
Rovereto B-LOC
, O
after O
winning O
the O
Championship O
of O
Promotion B-ORG
and O
being O
back O
in O
Excellence B-ORG
, O
it O
was O
absolutely O
not O
up O
to O
expectations O
. O

No O
one O
has O
come O
forward O
to O
support O
President O
Zandonai B-PER
's O
efforts O
. O

What O
we O
lack O
is O
a O
beautiful O
victory O
against O
a O
prestigious O
opponent O
; O

with O
three O
more O
points O
we O
would O
climb O
into O
a O
more O
important O
ranking O
position O
, O
when O
those O
players O
will O
fit O
in O
to O
make O
the O
difference O
we O

be O
back O

More O
than O
the O
7 O

shoulder O
to O
the O
Sicilian O
players O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O

: O

" O
I O

only O
accept O
the O

that O
it O

Then O
what O

something O

I O

it O

I O
repeat O

that O
it O

right O
that O
Roma B-ORG

played O
until O
the O
last O
one O
, O
that O
they O
have O
celebrated O

But O
then O
Pulvirenti B-PER
starts O
with O
the O
Spalletti B-PER
attack O
: O

Spalletti B-PER
felt O

from O

retouch O

little O
as O
possible O
the O
Juve B-ORG
of O
the O

for O

Taking O
the O
three O

the O

crucial O

because O
then O

that O

After O
so O
many O

this O

needed O
just O
to O
be O
done O
. O

Luca B-PER
Mazzanti I-PER
is O
so O
satisfied O
with O
this O
success O
that O
he O
no O
longer O
feels O
the O
tiredness O
, O
the O
cold O
, O
or O
the O
rain O
that O
is O
ripping O
his O
face O
. O

And O
he O
explains O
it O
like O
this O
: O

In O
the O
final O
I O
realized O
that O
Cunego B-PER
, O
who O
had O
been O
working O
the O
team O
all O
day O
, O
was O
no O
longer O
so O
brilliant O
. O

He O
, O
in O
the O
final O
ascent O
, O
had O
always O
closed O
in O
first O
person O
all O
the O
shots O
of O
my O
comrade O
Emanuele B-PER
Sella I-PER
and O
therefore O
seemed O
less O
responsive O
than O
usual O
. O

So O
I O
waited O
for O
Sella B-PER
's O
last O
blow O
, O
the O
last O
closing O
of O
the O
Veronese O
, O
to O
start O
in O
turn O
in O
counterfoot O
. O

We O
were O
no O
more O
than O
300 O
meters O
from O
the O
arrival O
and O
I O
gave O
everything O
I O
had O
, O
also O
because O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
take O
advantage O
of O
this O
opportunity O
Cunego B-PER
in O
an O
arrival O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
beat O
him O
anymore O
. O

You O
Panaria B-ORG
did O
the O
good O
and O
bad O
time O
: O

You O
first O
, O
Sella B-PER
fifth O
, O
Perez B-PER
Cuapio I-PER
ninth O
... O

To O
be O
honest O
, O
we O
only O
showed O
up O
in O
the O
finale O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
stage O
we O
let O
the O
Lampre B-ORG
work O
, O
also O
because O
in O
this O
Giro O
it O
is O
definitely O
the O
team O
to O
beat O
. O

You O
won O
the O
toughest O
stage O
, O
now O
the O
Giro O
is O
all O
downhill O
... O

Plan O
. O

I O
won O
here O
and O
this O
makes O
me O
happy O
, O
but O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Tour O
there O
are O
still O
three O
stages O
left O
and O
so O
anything O
can O
happen O
again O
. O

Cunego B-PER
, O
after O
all O
, O
is O
only O
at O
6 O
" O
so O
you O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
before O
singing O
victory O
. O

Of O
course O
there O
are O
two O
of O
us O
in O
the O
standings O
, O
me O
and O
Sella B-PER
and O
if O
we O
want O
also O
Perez B-PER
Cuapio I-PER
, O
then O
we O
will O
see O
to O
combine O
something O
good O
, O
but O
reasoning O
stage O
after O
stage O
" O

Special O

Yes O
, O
to O
Susy B-PER
, O
my O

who O
will O
make O
me O

I O
hope O
it O

but O
for O
the O
truth O
I O
have O
no O

He O
does O
not O
know O
the O
Solatrix B-ORG
case O
, O
but O
does O
not O
subtract O
from O
a O
consideration O

The O
basic O
point O
is O
to O
look O
at O
the O
expenditure O
, O
the O
times O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
works O
that O
are O
carried O
out O

If O
spending O

are O
exaggerated O

the O

low O

there O
is O
something O
wrong O

But O
in O

introduced O
by O

the O

Remo B-PER
Andreolli I-PER
, O
Violante B-PER
attacks O
on O
national O
scandals O
. O

On O
the O

Berlusconi B-PER
used O
the O
same O
words O
and O
lies O
as O
Mussolini B-PER
in O
1923 O

The O

which O
means O

The O
reason O
for O
the O
attack O
on O

is O
another O
: O

is O
the O
attack O
on O
another O
, O
more O
democratic O
, O
way O
of O
making O

. O

Violant B-PER
however O
admits O
that O
we O
had O
a O
phase O

we O
were O
caught O
by O

But O
for O
the O
Deissan O
executive O
Berlusconi B-PER
attacks O
on O
these O
issues O
because O
he O
is O
desperate O
, O
he O
is O
losing O

wants O
to O
prevent O

The O
letter O

President O

loses O
his O
temper O

a O

tells O
him O
that O
an O
executive O
of O

justified O
the O

claiming O
that O

not O
to O

, O
the O
Press O

Head O

also O
insists O
that O
: O

It O

This O
method O
of O

facilitates O
the O

It O
therefore O
improves O

This O
is O
what O

It O

everything O

It O
is O
good O
that O
we O

perhaps O
this O

The O

took O
us O
a O

a O
half O
to O
complete O
the O

- O
says O

because O

Furini B-PER
said O
he O
bought O
the O
hammer O
a O
few O
days O
before O
: O

an O
element O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
investigators O
, O
could O
cause O
the O
man O
to O
be O
charged O
with O
premeditated O
murder O
. O

At O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
raptus O
were O
, O
according O
to O
the O
statements O
made O
by O
the O
man O
, O
misunderstandings O
with O
the O

and O
especially O
the O

of O
the O

To O

the O

It O
was O

himself O

he O
had O
discovered O
his O

The O

there O
was O
nothing O

there O
were O
no O

So O
the O

But O
he O

the O

The O

One O
of O
the O

THE O
HISTORY O

of O
Ubaldo B-PER
Cordellini I-PER

Moved O
in O
four O
and O
four O
eights O
from O
Lavis B-LOC
to O
San B-LOC
Candido I-LOC
and O
all O
for O
falling O
in O
love O
with O
the O
wrong O
woman O
. O

It O
is O
the O
destiny O
that O
happened O
to O
a O
chosen O
policeman O
of O
twenty O
- O
nine O
years O
, O
Apulian O
of O
origin O
. O

The O
Arma B-ORG
notified O
him O
of O
the O
transfer O
on O
6 O
December O
last O
. O

Official O
reason O
: O

protection O
of O
his O
safety O
because O
the O
former O
partner O
of O
the O
woman O
, O
who O
lives O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
is O
a O
currently O
detained O
victim O
. O

But O
according O
to O
the O
policeman O
, O
it O
's O
just O
hypocrisy O
: O

In O
Trentino B-LOC
I O
have O
always O
been O
well O
. O

I O
've O
never O
had O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
anyone O
. O

The O
weapon B-ORG
wants O
to O
prevent O
my O
love O
story O
, O
but O
it O
will O
not O
succeed O
because O
there O
is O
no O
obstacle O
to O
true O
love O
. O

The O
Carabiniere O
is O
of O
Apulian O
origin O
, O
but O
has O
been O
serving O
in O
the O
province B-LOC
for O
many O
years O
now O
. O

His O
troubles O
began O
in O
July O
last O
year O
: O

In O
June O
I O
separated O
from O
my O
ex O
- O
wife O
and O
met O
my O
current O
partner O
. O

Trouble O
began O
in O
July O
. O

An O
ex O
- O
flame O
of O
my O
partner O
who O
has O
a O
bar O
in O
Cles B-LOC
started O
threatening O
me O
to O
move O
. O

He O
said O
he O
had O
connections O
in O
the O
weapon B-ORG
and O
that O
he O
would O
make O
me O
pay O
for O
it O
. O

He O
also O
threatened O
me O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
there O
's O
a O
case O
against O
him O
before O
the O
Cles B-LOC
Peace O
Judge O
. O

This O
person O
also O
allowed O
herself O
to O
call O
my O
ex O
- O
wife O
and O
tell O
her O
that O
I O
was O
with O
the O
former O
partner O
of O
a O
convicted O
felon O
. O

I O
did O
not O
give O
too O
much O
weight O
to O
it O
, O
but O
then O
in O
November O
I O
received O
the O
notice O
from O
the O
Regional O
Command O
that O
the O
transfer O
procedure O
had O
been O
initiated O
. O

I O
was O
very O
surprised O
and O
saddened O
by O
this O
news O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
explanations O
and O
I O
was O
told O
that O
there O
was O
an O
anonymous O
statement O
pointing O
out O
my O
relationship O
with O
my O
current O
partner O
. O

The O
transfer O
was O
justified O
with O
the O
protection O
of O
my O
safety O
. O

As O
if O
my O
partner O
's O
ex O
- O
boyfriend O
could O
hurt O
me O
. O

I O
explained O
that O
he O
is O
in O
prison O
, O
around O
Italy B-LOC
, O
and O
he O
has O
no O
intention O
of O
harming O
me O
. O

What O
he O
's O
interested O
in O
is O
that O
his O
ex O
and O
the O
two O
kids O
he O
had O
from O
her O
are O
okay O
. O

And O
they O
're O
fine O
with O
me O
. O

The O
Carabiniere O
's O
explanations O
, O
however O
, O
did O
not O
have O
any O
effect O
and O
the O
regional O
command O
transferred O
it O
from O
6 O
December O
last O
. O

The O
Carabiniere O
has O
nothing O
left O
but O
to O
challenge O
the O
measure O
through O
the O
lawyer O
Claudio B-PER
Tasin I-PER
. O

Yesterday O
in O
front O
of O
Tar B-ORG
di I-ORG
Trento I-ORG
, O
his O
request O
for O
suspension O
was O
discussed O
. O

The O
first O
results O
are O
expected O
for O
today O
. O

However O
, O
the O
policeman O
is O
convinced O
that O
his O
safety O
is O
not O
the O
real O
reason O
for O
the O
transfer O
: O

They O
say O
that O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
they O
are O
in O
danger O
, O
but O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
if O
it O
were O
true O
, O
would O
also O
be O
valid O
for O
South B-LOC
Tyrol O
. O

If O
someone O
wanted O
to O
hurt O
me O
, O
he O
could O
do O
it O
in O
Lavis B-LOC
like O
in O
San B-LOC
Candido I-LOC
. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
weapon B-ORG
wants O
to O
boycott O
my O
love O
story O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
a O
thousand O
times O
to O
understand O
it O
, O
but O
I O
could O
n't O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
my O
relationship O
is O
not O
well O
seen O
because O
my O
partner O
in O
the O
past O
has O
been O
the O
partner O
of O
a O
criminal O
. O

After O
all O
, O
they O
were O
not O
married O
. O

They O
have O
no O
legal O
link O
. O

What O
hurts O
me O
most O
is O
that O
the O
weapon B-ORG
, O
which O
for O
me O
represents O
much O
, O
listens O
more O
to O
an O
anonymous O
exposure O
than O
to O
my O
reasons O
and O
explanations O
. O

They O
want O
to O
stop O
my O
love O
story O
, O
but O
they O
wo O
n't O
. O

I O
have O
always O
behaved O
well O
and O
I O
have O
not O
violated O
any O
norm O
. O

The O
behavior O
is O
mirrored O
. O

Even O
my O
partner O
has O
no O
criminal O
record O
and O
has O
never O
been O
involved O
in O
matters O
concerning O
her O
ex O
. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
explain O
this O
outrage O
towards O
us O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
give O
up O
. O

A O
similar O
incident O
occurred O
at O
his O
birth O

Even O
though O
the O

grown O

after O
the O
incident O
at O

: O

The O
man O
going O
with O

But O
the O

that O

Let O
's O
imagine O
the O
scene O
: O

the O
Emilian O
group O
crossed O
the O
Val B-LOC
di I-LOC
Fiemme I-LOC
in O
the O
bus O
. O

From O
the O
bags O
came O
out O
libations O
of O
all O
kinds O
: O

Chips O
, O
pizzas O
and O
maybe O
even O
cups O
and O
culatelli O
. O

The O
young O
accused O
comes O
forward O
with O
dessert O
: O

a O
chocolate O
cake O
reinforced O
by O
a O
dusting O
of O
Moroccan O
" O
chocolate O
. O
" O

A O
scratch O
of O

just O
to O
make O
the O
trip O
pass O
faster O

The O
problems O
arrived O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
later O
, O
when O
the O
hashish O
entered O
digestion O
causing O
malaria O
in O
two O
gypsies O

It O
is O
not O
clear O
if O
these O
had O
eaten O
the O
cake O
knowing O
that O
it O
had O
been O
reinforced O
with O
Moroccan O
chocolate O
. O

Certainly O
there O
is O
that O
the O
improvised O
pastry O
chef O
from O
Emilia O
found O
himself O
in O
trouble O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
however O
, O
the O

There O

The O
texts O

As O

of O

that O
the O

fundamental O
for O

besides O

I O
must O
admit O
that O

I O
called O

they O
told O
me O
to O

They O
said O
that O
under O
my O

they O
would O
restore O
the O
original O

instead O
we O
are O

of O
the O
most O
angry O
is O

" O
With O
the O

took O

What O
's O
left O

is O

even O
more O
convenient O

Instead O
of O
tennis O

a O

The O

we O
hope O
that O
the O
inconveniences O
will O
soon O
end O

On O
the O
three O

are O
not O

by O
RENZO B-PER
M. I-PER
GROSSELLI I-PER

The O
magnadóra O
is O
certainly O
not O
a O
way O
of O
dealing O
with O
the O
local O
powers O
of O
this O
provincial B-ORG
junta I-ORG
. O

If O
anything O
, O
it O
is O
an O
ancient O
tradition O
of O
Christian B-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
that O
can O
still O
find O
some O
feedback O
, O
both O
inside O
the O
provincial O
machine O
and O
in O
certain O
environments O
of O
the O
Margaret B-ORG
. O

But O
President O
Dellai B-PER
is O
not O
the O
man O
who O
relies O
on O
this O
kind O
of O
administrative O
- O
political O
practice O
. O

However O
, O
more O
power O
should O
be O
given O
to O
the O
territorial O
area O
than O
to O
the O
provincial O
centre O
. O

And O
my O
reform O
- O
says O
Ottorino B-PER
Bressanini I-PER
, O
Ds B-ORG
, O
city O
council O
member O
for O
reforms O
- O
goes O
exactly O
in O
this O
direction O
. O
- O

Councillor O
Bressanini B-PER
, O
the O
center O
- O
left O
in O
this O
election O
campaign O
used O
the O
provincial O

condition O
the O

? O

Did O
he O
or O
did O
he O
not O
promise O
to O

the O

No O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
see O
the O

coming O

the O
Province B-LOC
with O
their O

in O

hands O
in O
this O
election O
round O
. O

This O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
has O
been O
a O
long O
tradition O
that O
Christian B-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
has O
cultivated O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

And O
that O
, O
while O
passing O
the O
time O
, O
remained O
almost O
a O
question O
of O
the O
system O
. O

That O
risks O
continuing O
until O
the O
center O
of O
power O
is O
unique O
. O

Too O
much O
power O
to O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
then O
? O

Sure O
, O
to O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

But O
I O
would O
n't O
say O
to O
the O
presidency O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
's O
clientele O
, O
I O
think O
, O
does O
very O
little O
. O

He O
constitutes O
a O
soul O
of O
the O
DC B-ORG
that O
has O
moved O
away O
from O
that O
system O
. O

There O
are O
other O
souls O
, O
in O
that O
party O
and O
in O
the O
provincial O
administration O
, O
who O
tend O
to O
keep O
that O
tradition O
alive O
. O

However O
, O
if O
I O
concentrate O
power O
in O
a O
single O
center O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
that O
clientele O
are O
born O
, O
pressure O
on O
lower O
levels O
of O
administration O
, O
conditioning O
. O

Democracy O
is O
bringing O
power O
close O
to O
the O
citizen O
, O
giving O
him O
more O
opportunities O
to O
manage O
it O
and O
condition O
it O
, O
direct O
it O
. O

Bressanini B-PER
, O
you O
have O
studied O
and O
proposed O
an O
institutional O
reform O
that O
could O
have O
some O
effect O
on O
this O
system O
. O

My O
institutional O
reform O
means O
precisely O
that O
: O

bring O
closer O
to O
citizenship O
the O
center O
of O
real O
power O
, O
avoiding O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
the O
system O
of O
blackmail O
and O
retaliation O
. O

But O
in O
order O
to O
do O
so O
, O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
that O
the O
financial O
flows O
, O
many O
financial O
flows O
, O
from O
the O
Province B-LOC
arrive O
to O
the O
territorial O
areas O
" O
by O
law O
" O
, O
without O
political O
mediation O
. O

And O
this O
is O
expected O
by O
the O
reform O
, O
in O
a O
much O
more O
important O
and O
significant O
way O
than O
now O
. O

I O
realise O
that O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
territories O
, O
areas O
, O
ways O
of O
electing O
certain O
bodies O
. O

But O
the O
important O
speech O
behind O
us O
is O
that O
of O
the O
exercise O
of O
power O
, O
which O
goes O
towards O
the O
territories O
. O

The O
micro O
dimensions O
of O
the O
municipalities O
do O
not O
give O
them O
the O
possibility O
to O
actually O
exercise O
the O
power O
. O

Instead O
, O
with O
the O
territorial O
areas O
that O
my O
reform O
envisages O
, O
there O
will O
be O
real O
steps O
of O
power O
starting O
from O
what O
is O
now O
the O
absolute O
centrality O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

Its O
reform O
takes O
into O
account O
and O
establishes O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
different O
financial O
competences O
? O

Sure O
. O

In O
Article O
7 O
there O
is O
a O
very O
detailed O
list O
, O
which O
establishes O
what O
are O
the O
competences O
that O
remain O
to O
the O
Province B-LOC
and O
those O
that O
instead O
pass O
to O
the O
valley O
communities O
. O

The O
most O
important O
are O
those O
of O
the O
territorial O
organization O
of O
urban O
planning O
( O
a O
power O
of O
second O
degree O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
must O
comply O
with O
the O
guidelines O
defined O
in O
the O
provincial O
context O
) O
. O

But O
then O
also O
the O
territorial O
organization O
of O
the O
planning O
of O
the O
development O
of O
a O
community O
. O

Every O
community O
will O
have O
to O
question O
itself O
and O
decide O
where O
it O
wants O
to O
go O
and O
how O
to O
get O
there O
. O

The O
Province B-LOC
does O
n't O
have O
to O
do O
that O
. O

The O
Province B-LOC
must O
only O
provide O
it O
with O
funding O
. O

Has O
anyone O
mentioned O
a O
surge O
of O
shields O
from O
the O
citizens O
, O
especially O
the O
valleys O
, O
against O
the O
so O
- O
called O
blackmail O
of O
the O
magnadóra O
Do O
you O
think O
this O
happened O
in O
the O
last O
elections O
? O

I O
did O
n't O
warn O
you O
of O
this O
surge O
of O
shields O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
, O
like O
the O
past O
, O
many O
Trentino O
citizens O
voted O
differently O
to O
politics O
, O
compared O
to O
the O
local O
elections O
. O

The O
left O
, O
for O
example O
, O
has O
always O
received O
more O
votes O
in O
national O
elections O
, O
because O
it O
was O
an O
ideal O
vote O
. O

While O
the O
provincials O
started O
the O
bad O
habit O
of O
the O
citizen O
to O
vote O
for O
the O
convenience O
, O
to O
vote O
with O
the O
hat O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

It O
is O
a O
little O
the O
speech O
of O
that O
mayor O
of O
Fai B-LOC
who O
is O
said O
to O
be O
center O
- O
right O
but O
who O
joined O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
in O
order O
to O
obtain O
the O
supposed O
advantages O
in O
relations O
with O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

It O
's O
a O
bit O
bad O
that O
mayor O
, O
his O
mentality O
is O
already O
customerizing O
out O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
he O
is O
more O
guilty O
than O
who O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
something O
really O
asks O
him O
. O

But O
it O
remains O
, O
however O
, O
extremely O
unfair O
and O
absolutely O
undemocratic O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
those O
in O
the O
Province B-LOC
who O
say O
they O
want O
to O
raise O
the O
price O
demanded O
of O
the O
mayors O
who O
did O
not O
vote O
well O
. O

It O
may O
be O
that O
the O
Margaret B-ORG
over O
the O
years O
has O
stimulated O
such O
behaviors O
. O

But O
the O
mammals O
do O
n't O
exist O
anymore O
, O
even O
to O
the O
left O
. O

What O
I O
want O
to O
say O
is O
that O
the O
attitude O
of O
selling O
oneself O
to O
power O
, O
not O
feeling O
citizens O
with O
rights O
but O
dependent O
on O
magnadóra O
, O
is O
a O
historic O
part O
of O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Trentino O
. O

Will O
the O
institutional O
reform O
that O
you O
have O
proposed O
be O
able O
to O
break O
this O
tradition O
? O

To O
the O
territories O
it O
provides O
greater O
instruments O
of O
autonomy O
, O
but O
also O
greater O
responsibilities O
to O
the O
local O
administrators O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
however O
, O
my O
aspiration O
is O
to O
increase O
people O
's O
participation O
in O
public O
affairs O
. O

Expand O
the O
daily O
relationship O
of O
the O
citizen O
with O
the O
power O
, O
today O
too O
poor O
. O

We O
do O
not O
want O
to O
create O
a O
new O
class O
of O
administrators O
but O
to O
spread O
power O
in O
society O
. O

Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
, O
in O
this O
sense O
, O
is O
a O
good O
leader O
? O

Without O
him O
, O
Trentino O
democracy O
would O
be O
more O
backward O
. O

Even O
if O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
praised O
for O
this O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
it O
must O
not O
feel O
anointed O
by O
the O
Lord B-PER
. O

Pediatrics O
inadequate O

the O

needs O
of B-PER
Palma I-PER
: O

We O
receive O
from O
three O
months O
to O
twenty O
years O
. O

I O
am O
sorry O
for O
these O
parents O
who O
may O
not O
have O
been O
able O
to O
manifest O
their O
discomfort O
in O
the O
department O
, O
otherwise O
we O
would O
have O
solved O
it O
, O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
because O
that O
of O
physical O
spaces O
in O
pediatrics O
is O
a O
long O
- O
standing O
problem O
, O
always O
raised O
by O
me O
and O
more O
recently O
also O
by O
Dr. O
Giannelli B-PER
. O

Surely O
something O
did O
n't O
work O
at O
the O
level O
of O
communication O
, O
so O
I O
already O
called O
Jacopo B-PER
's O
parents O
: O

I O
want O
to O
see O
them O
and O
talk O
to O
them O
and O
do O
surveys O
in O
the O
department O
to O
see O
how O
you O
can O
improve O

The O
primary O
of O
pediatrics O
of O
the O
hospital O
Santa B-ORG
Chiara I-ORG
, O
Annunziata B-PER
Di I-PER
Palma I-PER
, O
is O
sorry O
for O
the O
feeling O
of O
neglect O
and O
abandonment O
that O
Pamela B-PER
and O
Roberto B-PER
Pintarelli I-PER
had O
during O
the O
five O
- O
day O
hospital O
of O
their O
six O
- O
month O
- O
old O
child O
, O
described O
in O
their O
outlet O
at O
our O
newspaper O
( O
the B-ORG
Adige I-ORG
of O
yesterday O
) O
. O

For O
the O
little O
Jacopo B-PER
hospitalized O
in O
a O
room O
with O
older O
children O
, O
not O
equipped O
for O
his O
needs O
, O
and O
those O
of O
the O
mother O
who O
has O
always O
been O
with O
him O
, O
there O
was O
no O
place O
in O
the O
infant O
section O
. O

It O
was O
all O
full O
- O
says O
Dr. O
Di B-PER
Palma I-PER
- O
The O
epidemic O
period O
has O
begun O
and O
, O
although O
the O
admissions O
are O
as O
short O
as O
possible O
, O
there O
are O
never O
enough O
places O
. O

At O
the O
time O
the O
new O
pediatric O
building O
of O
Santa B-ORG
Chiara I-ORG
was O
a O
great O
innovation O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
neonatology O
with O
the O
nest O
had O
been O
brought O
on O
the O
same O
level O
as O
the O
gynecology O
. O

However O
, O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
paediatric O
population O
have O
changed O
completely O
in O
recent O
years O
: O

We O
hospitalize O
from O
three O
months O
to O
twenty O
years O
, O
also O
girls O
with O
nervous O
anorexia O
, O
with O
chronic O
diseases O
- O
explains O
Di B-PER
Palma I-PER
- O
. O

We O
do O
a O
number O
of O
low O
admissions O
in O
absolute O
, O
because O
they O
are O
around O
1200 O
/ O
1300 O
, O
but O
there O
are O
other O
1500 O
/ O
1700 O
children O
and O
boys O
held O
for O
observation O
even O
for O
36 O
hours O
. O

With O
this O
movement O
the O
programming O
on O
the O
24 O
places O
available O
is O
impossible O
, O
especially O
in O
this O
period O
of O
viral O
diffusion O
forms O
: O

is O
a O
moment O
of O
great O
work O
, O
with O
a O
fast O
and O
very O
pressing O
turn O
over O
. O

The O
operators O
of O
the O
department O
, O
however O
, O
put O
their O
heart O
in O
it O
, O
and O
so O
the O
volunteers O
who O
are O
here O
to O
help O
: O

for O
this O
reason O
they O
resented O
the O
feeling O
of O
abandonment O
described O
by O
this O
couple O
to O
the O
newspaper O
, O
and O
they O
resent O
people O
who O
also O
spend O
themselves O
with O
emotions O
and O
not O
only O
with O
the O
time O
that O
is O
dedicated O
to O
it O
. O

Jacopo B-PER
was O
in O
a O
room O
with O
a O
teenage O
girl O
, O
with O
different O
attitudes O
and O
other O
needs O
compared O
to O
infants O
. O

But O
readapting O
the O
rooms O
to O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
pediatric O
user O
, O
if O
he O
is O
a O
nursing O
child O
, O
if O
he O
is O
a O
school O
- O
age O
child O
or O
if O
he O
is O
a O
teenager O
- O
says O
Di B-PER
Palma I-PER
- O
is O
impossible O
in O
a O
structure O
that O
is O
inextensible O
and O
with O
such O
a O
high O
number O
of O
patients O
. O

Sorry O
for O
the O
hospitalization O
that O
in O
this O
case O
it O
has O
prolonged O
a O
little O
longer O
than O
the O
three O
days O
of O
the O
average O
, O
due O
to O
a O
delay O
in O
the O
request O
of O
the O
ultrasound O
( O
it O
does O
not O
depend O
on O
us O
) O
, O
the O
primary O
specifies O
that O
for O
the O
clinical O
part O
the O
situation O
had O
been O
faced O
and O
completed O
. O

" O
There O
was O
a O
disguido O
in O
the O
phase O
of O
resignation O
, O
but O
for O
a O
personal O
problem O
of O
the O
doctor O
- O
concludes O
Di B-PER
Palma I-PER
- O
. O

Probably O
this O
helped O
to O
determine O
this O
feeling O
of O
neglect O
that O
is O
not O
justified O
. O

The O
doctor O
had O
dedicated O
to O
her O
mother O
all O
the O
time O
she O
needed O

Dellai I-PER
pushes O
: O

It O
was O
a O
very O
difficult O
meeting O
, O
with O
an O
external O
representation O
transformed O
into O
a O
caricature O
: O

It O
seemed O
that O

had O

the O
Olive B-ORG
tree O
on O
one O
side O
and O
the O
Margaret B-ORG
on O
the O
other O
. O

Imagine O
my O
embarrassment O
, O
me O
who O
have O
always O
been O
prodian O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
co O
- O
founder O
of O
the O
Margaret B-ORG
. O

But O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
lets O
know O
that O
he O
supported O
with O
serenity O
the O
Rutelli B-PER
line O
: O

Ours O
is O
not O
an O
anti O

ulivist O
choice O
, O
nor O
against O
Prodi B-PER

We O
have O
only O
emphasized O
that O
at O
this O
moment O
there O
are O
more O
reasons O
for O
the O
autonomous O
presence O
of O
the O
Margaret B-ORG
than O
for O
the O
unique O
list O
" O
" O
. O

The O
stop O
to O
the O
unitary O
proposal O
( O
supported O
by O
Prodi B-PER
and O
Fassino B-PER
) O
however O
puts O
a O
brake O
on O
the O
unitary O
party O

postponed O
to O
better O
times O
: O

" O
We O
must O
understand O
this O
- O
continues O
Dellai B-PER
- O
We O
have O
only O
said O
against O
the O
unitary O
list O
in O
the O
proportional O
quota O
, O
which O
elects O
25 O
% O
of O

But O
if O
the O
goal O
was O
to O
continue O
towards O
the O
single O

, O
I O
say O
that O
for O
the O
time O
being O
there O
are O
no O
organizational O
, O

political O
conditions O
to O

On O

The O

only O
" O

" O
, O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
it O
concerns O
how O

But O
the O
unitary O

not O

: O

" O
First O
we O
make O
the O

then O
we O
can O
talk O

it O

continues O
the O

I O
believe O
that O
today O

be O
interpreted O

It O
is O
not O

the O
need O
to O

important O
appointment O
especially O
for O
the O
Margherita B-ORG

which O
in O
some O

showed O
signs O
of O
failure O
: O

I O
would O
say O
that O

is O
already O
very O
positive O
- O
says O
Betta B-PER
- O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
anyone O
who O
talks O
about O
Margherita B-ORG
in O
decline O
. O

Some O
examples O
? O

In O
Borgo B-LOC
we O
went O
from O
15 O
to O
32 O
% O
, O
in O
Pergine B-LOC
from O
15 O
to O
23 O
% O
, O
while O
in O
Riva B-LOC
and O
Cles B-LOC
we O
doubled O

I O
am O
surprised O
to O
see O
in O
your O
newspaper O
the O
list O
of O
countries O
where O
administrations O
have O
not O
been O
confirmed O
: O

in O

of O
these O

I O
remember O
Pinzolo B-LOC

also O
Coredo B-LOC

Of O
course O
any O
defeat O

have O
very O
heavy O
consequences O
: O

But O
we O
can O
no O

speak O
of O

of O

of O

among O

many O

who O

the O

Joan B-PER

a O
sunny O

who O
proves O
less O
than O
her O
48 O

and O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
, O
the O
two O
possible O
goals O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
course O
, O
chose O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
, O
a O
specific O
interest O
of O
the O
Tremembè B-ORG
Association I-ORG
, O
which O
has O
been O
working O
together O
with O
Project B-ORG
Prijedor I-ORG
for O
years O
. O

Why O
? O

I O
had O
always O
followed O
the O
war O
in O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
over O
the O
years O
and O
was O
deeply O
disturbed O
by O
so O
much O
violence O
. O

There O
, O
as O
in O
so O
many O
other O
places O
in O
the O
world O
( O
and O
unfortunately O
as O
is O
happening O
now O
between O
Israel B-LOC
and O
Palestine B-LOC
) O
, O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
only O
instrument O
for O
resolving O
disputes O
was O
the O
conflict O
. O

Although O
those O
areas O
attracted O
me O
, O
there O
was O
always O
something O
that O
kept O
me O
from O
really O
going O
there O
. O

It O
was O
as O
if O
all O
the O
hatred O
and O
ferocity O
, O
the O
inability O
to O
relate O
to O
others O
if O
not O
to O
the O
weapons O
and O
the O
abuse O
, O
kept O
me O
away O
. O

Was O
it O
a O
difficult O
trip O
? O

We O
left O
in O
four O
by O
car O
and O
without O
companion O
, O
but O
one O
of O
us O
had O
been O
in O
those O
areas O
before O
, O
traveling O
by O
bike O
with O
an O
organized O
tour O
from O
Traveling B-ORG

. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
association O
had O
prepared O
the O
ground O
for O
us O
, O
booking O
us O
the O
overnight O
stays O
and O
local O
guides O
, O
a O
help O
that O
- O
when O
you O
travel O
to O
those O
countries O
and O
in O
that O
way O
- O
is O
very O
valuable O
. O

Everything O
went O
well O
anyway O
: O

We O
were O
hosted O
in O
the O
family O
, O
coming O
into O
contact O
with O
the O
local O
realities O
, O
we O
lived O
with O
the O
families O
and O
listened O
to O
their O
stories O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
so O
many O
countries O
that O
have O
already O
been O
rebuilt O
but O
also O
so O
many O
needs O
and O
needs O
that O
do O
not O
yet O
find O
answers O
. O

And O
you O
feel O
everywhere O
the O
effort O
to O
return O
to O
normal O
, O
even O
if O
the O
wounds O
are O
still O
there O
and O
it O
will O
take O
time O
for O
them O
to O
heal O
. O

It O
was O
undoubtedly O
an O
experience O
that O
enriched O
us O
and O
left O
us O
precious O
memories O
. O

Among O
the O
material O
collected O
by O
Joan B-PER
, O
there O
are O
amazing O
illustrations O
of O
places O
, O
such O
as O
the O
water O
road O
Put O
vode O
, O
a O
path O
in O
central O
Serbia O
that O
winds O
through O
monasteries O
, O
castles O
and O
spas O
, O
bordering O
rivers O
and O
streams O
that O
intertwine O
and O
unravel O
on O
the O
territory O
. O

And O
one O
wonders O
why O
so O
many O
of O
us O
feel O
more O
at O
home O
in O
some O
unlikely O
and O
invented O
place O
like O
Sharm B-LOC
( O
so O
it O
is O
now O
familiarly O
called O
Sharm B-LOC
el I-LOC
Sheikh I-LOC
by O
the O
many O
scapers O
who O
have O
spent O
a O
few O
days O
there O
) O
and O
have O
never O
thought O
to O
put O
their O
noses O
within O
walking O
distance O
from O
home O
, O
in O
these O
enchanting O
places O
, O
rich O
in O
art O
, O
nature O
and O
history O
. O

History O
that O
so O
often O
- O
and O
also O
recently O
- O
has O
painfully O
looked O
at O
us O
closely O
. O

Luckily O
, O
there O
's O
always O
someone O
out O
of O
the O
choir O
. O

Because O
the O
real O
discovery O
is O
not O
looking O
for O
new O
lands O
but O
looking O
with O
new O
eyes O
. O

smiling O
the O
two O
major O
local O
representatives O
of O

hope O
or O

President O
Dellai B-PER
could O
not O
fail O
to O
attempt O
to O
sew O
the O
relationship O
, O
however O
never O
failed O
, O
with O
the O
highest O

authority O
. O

That O
report O
, O
which O
had O
appeared O
to O
some O
critical O
voices O
of O
Trentino O
policy O
, O
almost O
torn O
apart O
and O
whose O
points O
of O
reference O
appeared O
, O
and O
appear O
, O
somewhat O
blurred O
. O

More O
like O
an O
attempt O
to O
redefine O
areas O
, O
skills O
and O
management O
responsibilities O
of O
the O
Trentino O
territory O
; O

including O
that O
which O
sees O
the O
politics O
of O
the O
major O
provincial O
party O
in O
clear O
trouble O
and O
in O
search O
of O
an O
identity O
, O
whether O
political O
or O
cultural O
, O
lost O
or O
indefinable O
. O

Rizzoli B-PER
notes O
that O
by O
now O
the O
incineration O
issue O
has O
become O
a O
taboo O
, O
also O
in O
the O
relations O
between O
bishop O
and O
president O
: O

" O
It O
was O
impossible O
for O
President O
Dellai B-PER
not O
to O
mention O
the O
incineration O
issue O
, O
which O
is O
also O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
attention O
, O
although O
more O
discreetly O
addressed O
by O
Archbishop O
Bressan B-PER
. O

Almost O
as O
if O
it O
is O
a O
more O
delicate O
subject O
, O
politically O
heavier O
, O
with O
so O
little O
willingness O
for O
a O
real O
confrontation O
. O

Not O
even O
among O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
local O
Church B-ORG
, O
in O
fact O
, O
we O
have O
the O
courage O
to O
( O
re O
) O
talk O
about O
it O
; O

It O
would O
almost O
seem O
that O
it O
should O
remain O
a O
taboo O
even O
if O
many O
religious O
feel O
the O
need O
for O
greater O
coherence O
and O
presence O
on O
social O
issues O
on O
which O
the O
Catholic O
base O
is O
actually O
much O
more O
sensitive O
and O
vigilant O
than O
is O
believed O
. O

In O
his O
speech O
, O
the O
President O
referred O
to O
certain O
challenges O
; O

writes O
that O
" O
governing O
" O
means O
taking O
into O
account O
all O
positions O
, O
confronting O
all O
, O
while O
continuing O
to O
refuse O
that O
of O
a O
frank O
comparison O
with O
the O
opponents O
of O
his O
project O
of O
the O
incinerator O
. O

While O
it O
does O
not O
allow O
a O
single O
confrontation O
- O
contradictory O
, O
not O
even O
with O
those O
local O
communities O
that O
, O
just O
these O
days O
, O
require O
it O
loudly O
. O

His O
party O
partner O
, O
Councillor O
Silvano B-PER
Grisenti I-PER
, O
imposes O
rigidly O
separate O
meetings O
on O
his O
employees O
, O
see O
the O
recent O
ones O
of O
Faedo B-LOC
and O
Nave B-LOC
San I-LOC
Rocco I-LOC
and O
the O
one O
of O
next O
January O
10 O
in O
San B-LOC
Michele I-LOC
. O

Similarly O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
behavioral O
ethics O
, O
any O
public O
administrator O
or O
employee O
, O
or O
representative O
of O
trade O
associations O
who O
dares O
to O
show O
a O
single O
point O
of O
scepticism O
about O
the O
incineration O
project O
, O
resumes O
and O
scolds O
with O
Habsburgic O
punctuality O
. O

Does O
n't O
it O
seem O
strange O
to O
him O
that O
having O
invited O
him O
here O
more O
than O
twenty O
speakers O
of O
proven O
skills O
, O
without O
having O
yet O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
go O
to O
a O
comparison O
, O
do O
you O
really O
sound O
like O
the O
paradox O
of O
the O
selfishness O
of'Autonomy O
, O
even O
that O
of O
thought O
? O

It O
is O
ethical O
for O
the O
President O
to O
confine O
himself O
to O
resuming O
and O
silence O
all O
those O
who O
question O
or O
speak O
about O
the O
validity O
of O
his O
choice O
. O

In O
too O
many O
, O
both O
citizens O
and O
colleagues O
, O
they O
now O
know O
what O
is O
behind O
this O
ugly O
page O
of O
politics O
in O
Trentino O
, O
far O
beyond O
that O
sense O
of O
responsibility O
which O
he O
is O
led O
, O
by O
now O
increasingly O
tired O
, O
to O
refer O
. O

President O
Dellai B-PER
still O
feels O
the O
need O
to O
reject O
without O
discussion O
the O
criticism O
that O
he O
would O
not O
choose O
the O
incinerator O
's O
way O
to O
do O
business O
. O

It O
argues O
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
and O
proves O
that O
the O
incinerator O
could O
be O
one O
third O
large O
compared O
to O
the O
initial O
forecasts O
. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
even O
on O
this O
occasion O
he O
loses O
another O
chance O
to O
prove O
farsightedness O
, O
for O
the O
good O
of O
Trentino B-LOC

preferring O
that O
conditional O
, O
could O

Yesterday O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
in O
a O
newsstand O
near O
the O
city O
center O
there O
was O
a O
small O
stack O
of O
business O
cards O
that O
advertised O
a O
young O
professional O

On O
the O
business O
card O
there O
were O
the O
name O
and O
contact O
details O
of O
the O
lawyer O
, O
little O
thing O
, O
but O
enough O
to O
stumble O
into O
the O
ban O
on O
advertising O
that O
was O
in O
force O
until O
recently O
. O

For O
lawyers O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
there O
was O
the O
absolute O
prohibition O
to O
advertise O
their O
name O
and O
business O
. O

A O
rule O
, O
this O
, O
which O
has O
been O
deleted O
by O
the O
Bersani O
Decree O
on O
liberalisations O
. O

The O
rule O
prohibited O
any O
practice O
of O
grabbing O
customers O
, O
including O
the O
distribution O
of O
business O
cards O
. O

Practices O
which O
, O
moreover O
, O
were O
also O
prohibited O
by O
the O
code O
of O
self O
- O
regulation O
that O
lawyers O
had O
given O
themselves O
. O

One O
wanted O
to O
avoid O
reaching O
the O
levels O
that O
could O
be O
observed O
in O
the O
film O

lawyer O
Denzel B-PER
Washington I-PER
distributing O
business O
cards O
to O
victims O
of O
road O
accidents O

Now O
the O
ban O
is O
no O
longer O
there O
and O
there O
are O
already O
those O
who O
equip O
themselves O
to O
cope O

what O
is O

The O

health O

like O
the O
European O
one O
- O
writes O

denounces O
that O
he O
feels O
at O
risk O
for O
stress O

anxiety O

burnout O

mobbing O
; O

and O
today O
tends O
to O
perceive O
the O
organizational O
authority O
and O
its O
exercise O
as O
irrational O
, O
especially O
if O
it O
feels O
that O
it O
is O
being O
pressured O
to O
behave O
in O
a O
deontologically O
unacceptable O
manner O

Also O
the O
situations O
of O
the O
contractual O
tables O
, O
seen O
in O
this O
dimension O
, O
can O
only O
raise O
reflections O
on O
the O
climate O

almost O
7,000 O
people O
are O
working O
daily O
who O
, O
with O
dedication O

work O

the O
very O
important O
primary O
good O

is O
public O
health O

Doctors O
have O
even O
declared O
themselves O
willing O
to O
give O
up O
the O
provincial O

no O

found O
to O
the O
request O

that O
is O
added O
to O
the O

already O
very O
heavy O
in O
the O
Trentino O

But O
the O
signs O
of O
discontent O
, O
claims O
the O

been O
there O
for O
years O

And O
the O
recent O

Then O
, O
after O

in O

I O
asked O

What O

" O
I O
would O
try O

the O
concept O

a O

nothing O

nothing O

- O
is O
that O

probably O

Although O

Anti O

technology O
Modern O
technologies O
become O
increasingly O
important O
for O
the O
work O

at O

One O
example O
is O
three O

dimensional O
shots O
with O
the O
highest O
definition O
of O

scenes O
provided O
by O
a O
Bolzano O

To O
date O

about O
ten O

that O
of O
the O

Gianmario B-PER

The O

provided O

in O

Parma B-LOC

Messina B-LOC
and O
investigators O
have O
already O
begun O
to O
document O
the O
most O
important O
cases O
. O

The O
novelty O
of O
the O
system O
is O
to O
be O
able O
to O
document O
with O
perfection O
and O
in O
three O
- O
dimensional O
way O
a O
crime O
scene O
. O

The O
very O
high O
photographic O
resolution O
- O
more O
than O
55 O

- O
allows O
you O
to O
enlarge O
the O
minimum O

, O
and O
also O
can O
carry O
out O
any O
distance O
measurement O
in O
the O

. O

This O
system O
was O
developed O
by O
the O
3D B-ORG
- I-ORG
Pixel I-ORG
along O
with O
the O
Bolzanian O
prosecutor O
Cuno B-PER
Tarfusser I-PER

the O

Luciano B-PER
Garofano B-PER
del O

company O
and O
in O
collaboration O
with O
the O
general O
command O
of O
the O

of I-ORG
the O
Carabinieri O
. O

In O
a O
short O
time O
- O
explains O
Tarfusser B-PER
- O
the O
system O
can O
fully O
resume O
a O
scene O
. O

" O
It O
is O
a O
help O
not O
only O
for O
investigators O
, O
but O
also O
for O
judges O
, O
prosecutors O
and O
defenders O
" O
, O
added O
Garofano B-PER
. O

Among O
the O
advantages O
of O
the O
new O
system O
are O
the O
precise O
reinterpretation O
of O
the O
crime O
scene O
without O
having O
to O
return O
to O
the O

and O
the O
repeated O

of O
ROBERTA B-PER
BOCCARDI I-PER

Three O
draft O
laws O
on O
the O
hunting O
calendar O
to O
regulate O
the O
next O
hunting O
season O
, O
all O
three O
rejected O
by O
the O
third O
permanent B-ORG
commission I-ORG
of O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
, O
chaired O
by O
Roberto B-PER
Pinter I-PER
. O

Thus O
, O
with O
a O
twist O
, O
the O
procedure O
in O
committee O
of O
the O
three O
texts O
, O
presented O
by O
the O
Junta B-ORG
, O
the O
group O
of O
advisors O
of O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
and O
the O
green O
Bombarda B-PER
, O
ended O
. O

Pinter B-PER
was O
satisfied O
that O
, O
with O
nine O
amendments O
to O
the O
junta B-ORG
's O
bill O
, O
it O
was O
able O
to O
contain O
the O
hunting O
exercise O
, O
in O
fact O
involving O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
, O
but O
rejecting O
the O
accusation O
of O
an O
ambush O
aimed O
at O
President O
Dellai B-PER
. O

The O
reaction O
of O
the O
oppositions O
, O
in O
particular O
of O
Giovanazzi B-PER
who O
accuses O
the O
governor O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
of O
weakness O
, O
paled O
by O
his O
own O
majority O
, O
accomplice O
some O
absence O
to O
the O
work O
of O
the O
morning O
. O

President O
Dellai B-PER
, O
moreover O
, O
is O
determined O
to O
hold O
on O
, O
and O
has O
already O
stated O
that O
he O
will O
resume O
the O
original O
text O
in O
the O
Chamber O
, O
because O
he O
responds O
to O
the O
need O
to O
clarify O
the O
legislative O
framework O
in O
which O
the O
hunt O
takes O
place O
, O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
recent O
judgment O
of O
the O
Constitutional B-ORG
Court I-ORG
, O
adapting O
the O
provincial O
legislation O
to O
the O
national O
one O
. O

All O
three O
draft O
laws O
will O
arrive O
in O
the O
courtroom O
, O
and O
the O
text O
is O
radically O
modified O
by O
the O
junta B-ORG
which O
will O
need O
to O
be O
restored O
. O

But O
I O
hope O
that O
there O
will O
be O
room O
for O
discussion O
- O
says O
Pinter B-PER
- O
with O
some O
signal O
of O
less O
conflict O
between O
those O
who O
want O
too O
extensive O
use O
of O
the O
venatory O
withdrawal O
and O
those O
who O
are O
against O
the O
hunt O

Three O
issues O
on O
which O
Pinter B-PER
hopes O
there O
will O
be O
a O
rethinking O
: O

Sunday O
's O
respect O
as O
a O
day O
of O
venatory O
silence O
, O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
old O
system O
of O
the O
hunting O
of O
ungulates O
since O
September O
1 O
, O
excluding O
the O
summer O
period O
, O
and O
the O
elimination O
of O
the O
15 O
days O
of O
August O
for O
the O
hunting O
of O
chamois O
. O

Sunday O
as O
a O
day O
of O
venatory O
silence O
is O
an O
old O
ball O
of O
mine O
always O
, O
on O
holidays O
the O
mountain O
is O
more O
crowded O
and O
there O
are O
more O
people O
in O
the O
woods O
- O
explains O
Pinter B-PER
- O
. O

Second O
: O

the O
norm O
says O
that O
the O
hunting O
days O
are O
three O
out O
of O
five O
, O
but O
at O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
hunter O
, O
which O
ultimately O
leads O
them O
to O
five O
; O

I O
said O
no O
, O
that O
the O
days O
are O
actually O
three O
. O

Although O
it O
has O
been O
pointed O
out O
to O
me O
that O
in O
South B-LOC
Tyrol O
you O
hunt O
seven O
days O
out O
of O
seven O
, O
I O
do O
not O
see O
why O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
you O
can O
not O
do O
better O
. O

I O
start O
from O
the O
principle O
that O
, O
without O
prejudice O
to O
the O
venatory O
withdrawal O
, O
in O
less O
days O
we O
all O
do O
it O
better O
, O
because O
there O
is O
a O
contiguity O
of O
presence O
that O
is O
not O
only O
a O
danger O
, O
but O
also O
a O
problem O
of O
peace O
for O
the O
fauna O
and O
nature O
. O

The O
third O
question O
posed O
by O
Mr O
Pinter B-PER
, O
and O
removed O
from O
the O
amended O
text O
, O
is O
the O
question O
of O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
old O
hunting O
calendar O
, O
with O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
herbicides O
allowed O
even O
during O
the O
period O
from O
1 O
May O
to O
30 O
June O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
this O
was O
the O
main O
content O
of O
the O
law O
- O
continues O
Pinter B-PER
- O
but O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
lengthen O
the O
time O
to O
allow O
a O
well O
done O
withdrawal O
. O

Among O
other O
things O
, O
some O
hunters'representatives O
have O
also O
expressed O
concerns O
about O
this O
period O
, O
which O
is O
the O
period O
in O
which O
the O
youngest O
puppies O
are O
in O
circulation O
. O

Pinter B-PER
's O
amendment O
deleted O
this O
possibility O
, O
reintroduced O
by O
national O
legislation O
and O
contested O
by O
animalists O
. O

Divine B-PER
Absent O
and O
Chiocchetti B-PER
, O
Pinter B-PER
put O
forward O
his O
vote O
which O
, O
on O
equal O
terms O
, O
weighs O
twice O
, O
and O
with O
the O
vote O
of O
Bombarda B-PER
, O
and O
also O
on O
the O
Sunday O
of O
Carli B-PER
, O
has O
upset O
the O
text O
presented O
by O
the O
junta B-ORG
. O

At O
this O
point O
the O
law O
has O
been O
rejected O
, O
but O
it O
will O
go O
to O
court O
with O
the O
amended O
text O
forcing O
the O
majority O
to O
share O
with O
the O
amendments O
. O

" O
I O
have O
no O
illusions O
and O
I O
do O
not O
pretend O
that O
from O
evening O
to O
morning O
the O
hunt O
disappears O
- O
concludes O
Pinter B-PER
- O
but O
that O
some O
forms O
of O
carelessness O
towards O
tourism O
and O
towards O
those O
who O
frequent O
the O
woods O
I O
think O
it O
is O
possible O
" O

This O
year O
the O
municipality B-LOC
had O
to O
pronounce O
53 O
no O
in O
front O
of O
the O
boom O
of O
applications O
for O
registration O
to O
the O
summer O
kindergarten O
. O

Places O
sold O
out O
. O

That O
is O
why O
the O
junta B-ORG
decided O
yesterday O
that O
the O
offer O
will O
be O
increased O
in O
the O
future O
. O

From O
next O
year O
we O
will O
try O
to O
activate O
two O
structures O
instead O
of O
one O
, O
to O
try O
to O
assure O
the O
service O
to O
all O
those O
who O
will O
ask O
for O
it O
. O

The O
exit O
of O
the O

and O
the O
exclusion O
of O
a O
few O
dozen O
children O
had O
raised O
in O
recent O
days O
mugni O
e O
polemiche O
. O

The O
Councillor O
for O
Childhood O
and O

Renato B-PER
Pegoretti I-PER
therefore O
wanted O
to O
provide O
the O
official O
figures O
yesterday O
and O
explain O
the O
choices O
of O
the O
municipal O
administration O
. O

This O
year O
, O
to O
try O
to O
widen O
the O
offer O
, O
the O
summer O
mother O
will O
be O
hosted O
in O
the O
building O
of O
Maso B-LOC
Ginocchio I-LOC
, O
the O
most O
spacious O
of O
the O

The O
seats O
available O
for O
each O

are O
125 O
full O
time O
plus O
25 O
part O
time O
. O

That O
multiplied O
by O
eight O
weeks O
make O
1,000 O
places O
plus O
200 O
. O

In O
the O
face O
of O
this O
offer O
the O
excluded O
, O
after O
giving O
up O
, O
were O
42 O
full O

time O
( O
28 O
in O
the O
second O

. O

They O
are O
not O
half O
of O
the O
applicants O
, O
as O
someone O
has O
said O
, O
commented O
the O
city O
council O
member O
. O

It O
pointed O
out O
that O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
in O
August O
, O
demand O
was O
significantly O
lower O
than O
the O
bid O
. O

The O
other O
complaint O
was O
related O
to O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
service O
, O
EUR O
93 O
per O
week O
. O

Definitely O
high O
if O
compared O
to O
the O
130 O
euros O
spent O
for O
the O
attendance O
of O
a O
whole O
regular O
school O
year O
. O

But O
let O
's O
not O
forget O
- O
Pegoretti B-PER
says O
- O
that O
the O
summer O
is O
a O
service O
made O
available O
by O
the O
municipality B-LOC
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
families O
. O

We O
do O
not O
receive O
any O
contribution O
from O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
a O
tariff O
coverage O
of O
half O
of O
the O
expenditure O
was O
requested O
. O

However O
, O
the O
maximum O
rate O
is O
paid O
by O
a O
small O
minority O
of O
just O
over O
10 O
% O

Another O

, O
according O
to O
the O
Isee O

, O
can O
send O

paying O
anything O

The O

in O
the O

spoke O
of O
a O

that O

reminding O
them O
also O
dramatic O

the O

Great O
importance O

therefore O

Vice O
President O
Cogo B-PER
remembers O
the O
times O
when O
she O
was O
a O

, O
first O
at O
the O
Istituto B-ORG

and O
then O
at O
the O

of I-ORG

, O
with O
nostalgia O
. O

A O
particular O
fact O
that O
marked O
his O
school O
excursion O
, O
is O
a O
recurring O
dream O
that O
accompanied O
him O
up O
to O
ten O
years O
ago O
: O

I O
dreamed O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
diploma O
of O
maturity O
and O
that O
I O
had O
to O
repeat O
the O
exams O
in O
order O
to O
recover O
it O
. O

I O
wonder O
what O
that O
might O
mean O
. O

Certainly O
the O
maturity O
of O
the O
vice O

went O
well O

Cogo B-PER

in O

that O
she O

never O

that O
that O

is O
the O

The O

were O
the O

the O

the O
last O
one O
was O
the O

The O

Those O
who O
had O
tried O
to O
turn O
to O
Telecom B-ORG
had O
so O
far O
made O
a O
hole O
in O
the O

. O

Since O
Adiconsum B-ORG
began O
to O
collect O
complaints O
, O
Telecom B-ORG
has O
changed O
its O
attitude O
and O
has O
admitted O
regional O
representatives O
of O
the O

Several O
disputes O
are O
discussed O
each O

some O
of O
which O
are O
good O
for O
the O

, O
to O
whom O
the O

part O

A O
definitive O
solution O
, O
however O
, O
is O
still O
far O
away O

Navigating O

and O
even O
the O

Consumer O
associations O
call O
for O
Telecom B-ORG
to O
intervene O
by O
installing O
filters O
that O
prevent O
the O
dialer O
from O
colonizing O
our O
home O
computers O
, O
but O
they O
also O
point O
out O
that O
Telecom B-ORG
is O
gaining O
on O
traffic O
. O

And O
then O
once O
a O
number O
with O
added O
value O
has O
been O
turned O
off O
, O
another O
one O
appears O
immediately O
just O
as O
capable O
of O
emptying O

. O

To O
seek O
a O
definitive O
solution O
to O
the O
problem O
the O
associations O
have O
asked O
the O
intervention O
of O
the O
Guarantor B-ORG
of I-ORG
the O

Calì B-PER

I O

what O
we O

Vincenzo B-PER
Calì I-PER
( O
in O
the O
picture O
) O
is O
a O
river O
in O
the O
middle O

He O
is O
following O
step O
by O
step O
the O
iter O
of O
this O
variant O
and O
Via B-LOC

for O
the O
vice O
president O
of O
the O
Argentario B-LOC
circuit I-LOC
, O
elected O
in O
Trento B-ORG
democratica I-ORG
, O
has O
become O
a O
trench O
. O

If O
it O
gets O
over O
, O
he O
's O
ready O
to O
leave O
. O

Also O
because O
of O
the O
symbolic O
meaning O
that O
took O
on O
this O
story O
. O

The O
professor O
recalls O
that O
the O
entire O
east O
hill O
is O
considered O
a O
zone O
at O
risk O
from O
a O
hydrogeological O
point O
of O
view O
. O

It O
is O
the O
starting O
point O
of O
his O
reasoning O
. O

We O
are O
on O
paleofrane O
that O
if O
left O
alone O
they O
can O
hold O
quietly O
but O
if O
we O
start O
to O
build O
us O
they O
risk O
coming O
down O
. O

It O
is O
so O
on O
all O
Calisio B-LOC
and O
we O
instead O
of O
answering O
today O
's O
questions O
we O
should O
think O
about O
our O
great O
- O
grandchildren O
. O

According O
to O
Calì B-PER
, O
removing O
the O
building O
of O
Via B-LOC
dell I-LOC
' O
Albera O
would O
be O
an O
important O
political O
signal O
of O
counter O
- O
trend O
, O
after O
decades O
of O
cementification O
in O
such O
delicate O
areas O
. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
do O
the O
responsibility O
will O
be O
especially O
of O
the O
Margaret B-ORG
. O

I O
wonder O
- O
attacks O
the O
vice O
- O
president O
of O
the O
circuit B-LOC
- O
where O
is O
the O
coherence O
of O
this O
party O
that O
shares O
the O
principle O
of O
stop O
to O
the O
edification O
on O
the O
hill O
but O
then O
in O
Povo B-LOC
gives O
negative O
opinion O
on O
the O
excavation O
of O
an O
' O
artisan O
area O
while O
in O
Argentario B-LOC
decides O
to O
realize O
a O
new O
one O
. O

It O
also O
considers O
incongruity O
the O
choice O
to O
accompany O
the O
private O
settlement O
public O
services O
that O
, O
given O
the O
necessary O
debanking O
, O
will O
come O
to O
cost O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
, O
just O
as O
the O
city O
council O
member O
to O
the O
budget O
announces O
years O
of O
lean O
cows O
. O

Also O
because O
a O
possible O
alternative O
would O
be O
there O
ready O
: O

There O
are O
two O
building O
skeletons O
near O
the O
Poli O
supermarket O
built O
twenty O
years O
ago O
and O
never O
finished O
, O
for O
quarrels O
among O
the O
owners O
- O
he O
points O
out O
- O
and O
an O
expropriation O
would O
also O
solve O
the O
problem O
of O
those O
ugliness O
in O
the O
already O
built O
area O
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
here O
we O
started O
from O
the O
need O
for O
a O
private O
rather O
than O
public O
needs O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
company O
Leveghi B-ORG
does O
not O
have O
a O
customer O
pool O
limited O
to O
the O
hill O
but O
works O
in O
the O
city O
and O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
province B-LOC
. O

It O
seems O
absurd O
to O
me O
to O
want O
him O
to O
stay O
in O
Martignano B-LOC
only O
because O
the O
owner O
lives O
there O
. O

Its O
place O
would O
be O
in O
one O
of O
the O
many O
unused O
sheds O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O

. O

ROME B-LOC
- O
With O
the O
devolution O
the O
government O
has O
completed O
the O
twelve O
tables O
of O
our O
program O
: O
only O
the O
tax O
reform O
is O
missing O
, O
but O
on O
this O
point O
we O
are O
in O
trouble O
for O
the O
hole O
that O
we O
have O
found O
, O
we O
will O
see O
in O
Financial O
to O
give O
some O
signal O
. O

With O
these O
words O
, O
they O
tell O
, O
Berlusconi B-PER
would O
have O
concluded O
the O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
, O
expressing O
his O
satisfaction O
for O
having O
successfully O
overcome O
also O
the O
rock O
of O
the O
federal O
reform O
. O

A O
result O
achieved O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
Council B-ORG
meeting O
not O
quite O
quiet O
. O

Indeed O
, O
as O
has O
been O
learned O
, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
several O
moments O
of O
tension O
for O
the O
verbal O
clashes O
between O
ministers O
. O

But O
it O
would O
n't O
have O
been O
devolution O
that O
warmed O
the O
spirits O
. O

The O
first O
lively O
debate O
would O
have O
been O
for O
the O
ratification O
of O
the O
Treaty O
of O
Nice B-LOC
. O

The O
Minister O
for O
Reforms O
Umberto B-PER
Bossi I-PER
would O
have O
strongly O
opposed O
it O
, O
defining O
this O
Treaty O
as O
" O
undemocratic O
" O
. O

Other O
ministers O
would O
have O
pointed O
out O
to O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Carroccio B-ORG
that O
the O
passage O
to O
the O
Chambers O
of O
a O
text O
so O
important O
for O
the O
European B-LOC
Union I-LOC
is O
an O
act O
due O
. O

On O
positions O
close O
to O
those O
of O
Bossi B-PER
, O
even O
if O
with O
some O
distinction O
, O
would O
have O
sided O
also O
Giulio B-PER
Tremonti I-PER
and O
Antonio B-PER
Martino I-PER
. O

At O
that O
point O
the O
Minister O
for O
Community O
Policies O
Rocco B-PER
Buttiglione I-PER
would O
raise O
his O
voice O
strongly O
claiming O
that O
the O
European O
commitment O
is O
part O
of O
the O
government O
's O
programme O
at O
least O
as O
much O
as O
the O
devolution O
. O

Berlusconi B-PER
would O
not O
have O
intervened O
in O
the O
discussion O
, O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
an O
intervention O
by O
the O
foreign O
minister O
Renato B-PER
Ruggiero I-PER
to O
convince O
Bossi B-PER
to O
give O
in O
. O

The O
second O
proposal O
that O
led O
to O
a O
lively O
debate O
was O
the O
draft O
constitutional O
reform O
put O
forward O
by O
the O
Minister O
for O
Equal O
Opportunities O
Stefania B-PER
Prestigiacomo I-PER
, O
aimed O
at O
amending O
art O
. O
51 O
to O
promote O
the O
presence O
of O
women O
in O
elected O
assemblies O
. O

Again O
it O
would O
have O
been O
Bossi B-PER
who O
protested O
vigorously O
. O

Bossi B-PER
would O
have O
pointed O
out O
that O
, O
as O
he O
is O
the O
Minister O
for O
Reforms O
, O
any O
proposal O
to O
amend O
the O
Constitution O
must O
be O
submitted O
for O
examination O
. O

I O
am O
the O
one O
who O
proposes O
reforms O
in O
this O
government O
- O
he O
would O
have O
asked O
to O
be O
irritated O
- O
is O
n't O
that O
right O
? O

In O
this O
case O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
League B-ORG
would O
have O
obtained O
more O
consensus O
, O
thus O
making O
it O
necessary O
to O
examine O
the O
merits O
of O
the O
proposal O
. O

Many O
would O
have O
objected O
that O
talking O
about O
equal O
access O
would O
have O
reopened O
the O
long O
- O
standing O
issue O
of O
quotas O
. O

If O
you O
start O
with O
women O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
observed O
, O
you O
could O
then O
get O
to O
establish O
a O
number O
of O
places O
to O
be O
reserved O
for O
linguistic O
minorities O
, O
ethnic O
minorities O
and O
other O
particular O
communities O
. O

Hence O
the O
solution O
to O
introduce O
the O
less O
demanding O
expression O
of O
" O
equal O
opportunities O
" O
into O
the O
rewriting O
of O
Article O
51 O
. O

The O
devolution O
, O
instead O
, O
the O
strong O
dish O
of O
the O
day O
, O
would O
have O
been O
the O
point O
with O
minor O
frictions O
. O

With O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
framework O
law O
to O
accompany O
constitutional O
reform O
, O
an O
amendment O
to O
the O
text O
of O
the O
reform O
made O
by O
Bossi B-PER
himself O
would O
have O
been O
accepted O
, O
stating O
that O
devolution O
must O
have O
as O
limits O
the O
guarantee O
of O
constitutional O
rights O
and O
duties O
and O
constitutional O
laws O
. O

A O
step O
- O
by O
- O
step O
journey O
would O
have O
been O
established O
: O

today O
the O
modification O
of O
only O
Article O
117 O
, O
introducing O
the O
exclusive O
competence O
of O
the O
Regions O
on O
school O
, O
health O
and O
local O
safety O
. O

In O
a O
second O
phase O
, O
the O
revision O
of O
Article O
119 O
, O
which O
regulates O
transfers O
of O
resources O
, O
and O
the O
new O
procedures O
on O
the O
election O
of O
members O
of O
the O
Constitutional B-ORG
Court I-ORG
, O
will O
have O
to O
be O
addressed O
. O

The O
Council B-ORG
also O
indicated O
the O
date O
of O
7 O
October O
for O
the O
holding O
of O
the O
confirmation O
referendum O
on O
federalism O
. O

On O
devolution O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Ministers I-ORG
reached O
a O
full O
political O
agreement O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
devolution O
, O
the O
broad O
lines O
of O
the O
reform O
were O
unanimously O
approved O

But O
the O

of O
the O
bill O
will O
be O
formalized O
and O
approved O
by O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Ministers I-ORG
immediately O
after O
the O

. O

A O
general O

has O
been O
found O

at O
the O
end O
of O
the O

Perhaps O
at O
that O
point O
the O
reflection O
that O
did O
not O
take O
place O
after O
11 O
September O
may O
be O
triggered O
. O

American O
public O
opinion O
will O
then O
wonder O
if O
weapons O
are O
the O
right O
means O
for O
international O
peace O
. O

In O
America B-LOC
there O
is O
a O
strong O
minority O
, O
today O
silent O
, O
that O
in O
the O
elections O
can O
react O
differently O
from O
what O
the O
Bush B-PER
administration O
expects O
. O

Let O
us O
remember O
that O
the O
election O
of O
the O
president O
took O
place O
in O
a O
split O
country O
, O
which O
has O
inside O
strong O
oppositions O
to O
the O
war O
( O
Noam B-PER
Chomsky I-PER
) O
, O
which O
saw O
the O
Americans O
until O
the O
last O
favorable O
to O
a O
second O
resolution O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
. O

However O
, O
Iraq B-LOC
has O
shown O
that O
, O
all O
in O
all O
, O
making O
a O
war O
for O
the O
most O
powerful O
army O
in O
the O
world O
is O
an O
easy O
and O
quick O
thing O
. O

Saddam B-PER
's O
palaces O
have O
been O
occupied O
in O
not O
even O
a O
month O
. O

Among O
the O
300,000 O
men O
employed O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
barely O
a O
handful O
, O
and O
mostly O
for O
" O
friend O
fire O
" O
. O

Could O
this O
not O
change O
the O
opinion O
of O
many O
people O
and O
suggest O
that O
war O
can O
become O
the O
ordinary O
means O
of O
American O
foreign O
policy O
? O

Without O
a O
doubt O
in O
prominent O
characters O
like O
Rumsfeld B-PER
and O
Wolfowitz B-PER
( O
number O
one O
and O
number O
two O
of O
the O
Pentagon O
, O
n.d.r O
. O
) O
there O
has O
always O
been O
the O
idea O
that O
war O
was O
a O
message O
to O
send O
to O
Syria B-LOC
and O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

How O
to O
say O
: O

Careful O
, O
that O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
be O
good O
then O
we O
come O
to O
you O
. O

The O
reality O
, O
however O
, O
is O
not O
that O
simple O
. O

The O
Americans O
have O
shown O
themselves O
to O
be O
good O
at O
the O
war O
. O

It O
is O
all O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
however O
, O
if O
they O
will O
be O
so O
in O
the O
management O
of O
peace O
keeping O
and O
nation O
building O
. O

We O
must O
remember O
that O
Iraq B-LOC
is O
a O
country O
to O
be O
rebuilt O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
predict O
that O
, O
after O
the O
first O
enthusiasm O
, O
after O
a O
few O
months O
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
will O
realize O
that O
it O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
control O
the O
country O
, O
to O
rebuild O
it O
, O
to O
establish O
a O
democratic O
government O
. O

This O
will O
make O
it O
necessary O
to O
rethink O
the O
role O
of O
international O
bodies O
, O
of O
Europe B-LOC
, O
of O
multilateral O
alliances O
, O
of O
the O
casual O
use O
of O
arms O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
however O
, O
relations O
between O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
Europe B-LOC
are O
freezing O
; O

the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
no O
longer O
have O
any O
role O
; O

NATO B-ORG
is O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
line O
; O

any O
hypothesis O
of O
multilateral O
alliances O
has O
disappeared O
. O

Rebuilding O
this O
network O
of O
relationships O
and O
institutions O
will O
not O
really O
be O
a O
breeze O
. O

For O
the O
united B-LOC
Europe I-LOC
it O
is O
an O
unprecedented O
hit O
. O

If O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
continues O
to O
think O
of O
doing O
its O
own O
thing O
in O
the O
post O
- O
war O
management O
of O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
without O
the O
UN B-ORG
and O
without O
the O
EU O
, O
we O
will O
be O
witnessing O
a O
reunion O
of O
Europe B-LOC
on O
the O
contrary O
. O

The O
eight O
European O
countries O
wire O
- O
US B-LOC
will O
find O
themselves O
dismayed O
to O
support O
an O
uncritical O
position O
alongside O
the O
States B-LOC
. O

Blair B-PER
himself O
would O
be O
in O
serious O
trouble O
. O

If O
post O
- O
war O
management O
- O
as O
analysts O
predict O
- O
proves O
to O
be O
harsh O
and O
risky O
, O
then O
it O
would O
be O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
itself O
to O
appear O
before O
the O
UN O
and O
ask O
the O
international O
community O
to O
step O
forward O
. O

If O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
we O
were O
to O
witness O
a O
victorious O
management O
by O
the O
US B-LOC
even O
after O
the O
war O
, O
then O
, O
indeed O
, O
Europe B-LOC
would O
be O
greatly O
weakened O
, O
and O
international O
institutions O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
line O
. O

But O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
the O
least O
likely O
scenario O
. O

The O
fact O
remains O
that O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
has O
demonstrated O
in O
the O
field O
that O
it O
is O
a O
military O
force O
of O
incredible O
power O
, O
capable O
of O
making O
war O
alone O
, O
whenever O
it O
wants O
, O
against O
whom O
it O
wants O
, O
without O
anyone O
being O
able O
to O
contrast O
, O
and O
with O
human O
costs O
all O
in O
all O
contained O
thanks O
to O
technology O
. O

This O
will O
not O
be O
without O
worldwide O
effects O
, O
also O
affecting O
relations O
with O
Europe B-LOC
and O
the O
rest O
of O
world O
democracies O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
the O
Americans O
themselves O
have O
marveled O
at O
the O
enormous O
and O
frightening O
military O
power O
they O
have O
. O

Such O
a O
strong O
superpower O
is O
very O
dangerous O
. O

There O
is O
a O
counterweight O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
a O
democracy O
and O
has O
a O
public O
opinion O
to O
respond O
to O
. O

But O
it O
's O
not O
reassuring O
. O

Not O
only O
for O
the O
use O
that O
can O
be O
made O
of O
military O
potential O
. O

But O
also O
for O
the O
reactions O
that O
can O
trigger O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Who O
knows O
they O
're O
in O
the O
crosshairs O
, O
then O
they O
'll O
say O
, O

I O
have O
nothing O
to O
lose O
and O
it O
will O
trigger O
unthinkable O
reactions O
. O

Like O
kamikaze O
and O
fedayn O
do O
. O

We O
must O
deal O
with O
the O
despair O
of O
those O
who O
know O
they O
are O
losers O
. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
trust O
American O
domestic O
public O
opinion O
. O

The O
Rumsfeld B-PER
line O
is O
not O
said O
to O
be O
the O
winning O
one O
, O
and O
at O
the O
next O
presidential O
we O
might O
have O
some O
surprises O
and O
a O
decided O
change O
of O
course O
. O

who O
was O
seen O
with O
the O
leader O
of O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
in O
Arcore B-LOC
last O
night O
at O
dinner O
. O

Yesterday O
was O
practically O
a O
day O
off O
for O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
Pole B-ORG
who O
still O
continue O
to O
invoke O
the O
early O
elections O
, O
attacking O
the O
majority O
of O
government O
. O

And O
precisely O
the O
leader O
of O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
explained O
that O
new O
elections O
these O
do O
not O
cancel O
referendums O
. O

In O
an O
interview O
with O
the O
" O
Foglio B-ORG
" O
that O
preceded O
it O
, O
Berlusconi B-PER
states O
that O
" O
referendums O
can O
be O
held O
next O
year O
, O
the O
elections O
do O
not O
cancel O
them O
. O

D'Alema B-PER
goes O
away O
and O
says O
: O

The O
country O
has O
distrusted O
me O
. O

When O
a O
democratic O
country O
distrusts O
the O
government O
- O
explained O
Berlusconi B-PER
- O
it O
makes O
another O
after O
free O
elections O
. O

We O
have O
an O
impregnable O
position O
. O

It O
seems O
obvious O
to O
us O
- O
he O
said O
- O
that O
the O
country O
has O
a O
clear O
, O
net O
, O
problem O
of O
political O
relegitimacy O
. O

New O
elections O
are O
the O
only O
way O
to O
re O
- O
establish O
the O
virtuous O
circuit O
between O
the O
real O
country O
and O
the O
legal O
country O
. O
We O
say O
so O
- O
he O
insisted O
- O
because O
we O
are O
convinced O
, O
without O
jattanza O
. O

We O
are O
full O
of O
understanding O
for O
the O
issues O
that O
the O
head O
of O
state O
must O
resolve O
and O
we O
know O
that O
he O
is O
the O
referee O
of O
the O
times O
and O
ways O
of O
resolving O
the O
crisis O
, O
but O
if O
it O
counts O
the O
opinion O
of O
those O
who O
, O
in O
successive O
electoral O
rounds O
, O
have O
been O
given O
a O
wide O
political O
delegation O
by O
the O
sovereign O
people O
, O
this O
opinion O
is O
that O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
mess O
up O
. O

The O
leader O
of O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
then O
told O
the O
Foglio B-ORG
that O
he O
wants O
to O
define O
a O
calendar O
of O
talks O
, O
of O
course O
also O
confidential O
, O
with O
the O
personalities O
that O
matter O
in O
the O
Italian O
economy O
. O

As O
for O
D'Alema B-PER
Berlusconi B-PER
says O
he O
is O
totally O
free O
from O
resentment O
, O
by O
character O
and O
by O
choice O
of O
life O
since O
always O
and O
renews O
his O
respect O
at O
the O
time O
of O
defeat O
. O

I O
have O
always O
shown O
consideration O
and O
respect O
for O
D'Alema B-PER
, O
who O
judge O
an O
intelligent O
person O
. O

I O
will O
not O
fail O
this O
fair O
play O
rule O
now O
that O
the O
melancholy O
of O
such O
a O
heavy O
defeat O
stretches O
over O
him O
. O

Then O
Berlusconi B-PER
pulled O
an O
arrow O
at O
the O
left O
: O

It O
's O
not O
enough O
to O
flirt O
with O
the O
Internet O
to O
be O
modern O
. O

It O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
say O
that O
we O
are O
liberal O
in O
fact O
. O

It O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
demonize O
the O
opponent O
, O
threaten O
him O
, O
throw O
at O
him O
against O
the O
cheapest O
propaganda O
to O
make O
himself O
a O
soul O
and O
give O
himself O
an O
identity O
. O

Berlusconi B-PER
explains O
, O
however O
, O
that O
he O
has O
found O
a O
country O
waiting O
to O
be O
quietly O
and O
compositely O
freed O
from O
the O
shepherds O
of O
an O
intrusive O
, O
omnivorous O
power O
that O
identifies O
with O
the O
State O
and O
that O
to O
the O
society O
can O
propose O
only O
ties O
. O

The O
leader O
of O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
also O
tells O
us O
that O
when O
the O
ship O
" O
Azzurra O
" O
sailed O
, O
there O
were O
those O
who O
warned O
him O
, O
saying O
: O

Let O
's O
hurry O
, O
before O
they O
change O
the O
code O
of O
navigation O
and O
interdict O
to O
oppositions O
also O
the O
use O
of O
the O
sea O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
the O
country O
- O
explains O
Berlusconi B-PER
- O
needed O
not O
only O
a O
program O
and O
an O
alternative O
ruling O
class O
, O
it O
needed O
above O
all O
a O
technique O
of O
freedom O
, O
an O
incentive O
to O
feel O
adult O
and O
in O
full O
possession O
of O
itself O
and O
there O
I O
realized O
that O
a O
certain O
instinct O
and O
a O
certain O
philosophy O
of O
life O
that O
my O
coalition O
and O
I O
represent O
would O
find O
in O
the O
vote O
a O
safe O
, O
solid O
, O
unappellable O
. O

In O
the O
day O
Enrico B-PER
La I-PER
Loggia I-PER
, O
head O
of O
the O
Berlusconian O
senators O
said O
that O
after O
the O
defeat O
of O
D'Alema B-PER
, O
in O
this O
legislature O
I O
do O
not O
see O
practicable O
any O
hypothesis O
of O
government O
. O

the O
fake O
majority O
was O
deligitated O
by O
voters O
who O
said O
no O
to O
the O
leftists O
. O

For O
the O
Pole B-ORG
it O
was O
an O
overwhelming O
success O
, O
obtained O
despite O
the O
liberticide O
laws O
launched O
by O
the O

ROME B-LOC
- O
A O
day O
so O
dense O
of O
events O
that O
seemed O
to O
be O
studied O
at O
the O
table O
for O
the O
great O
return O
, O
that O
of O
Romano B-PER
Prodi I-PER
, O
who O
closed O

the O

A O
day O
with O

marked O

such O
as O
the O
" O

of O

the O

whom O
he O
has O
expressed O
the O
strong O
concerns O
for O

the O
Italian O
economy O
and O
above O
all O
for O
the O
development O
of O
public O
accounts O
, O
saying O
that O
Italy B-LOC
is O
a O
Country O
to O
be O
redone O
. O

The O
guilt O
? O

Of O
the O
three O
years O
of O
Berlusconi O
government O
which O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Professor O
, O
has O
squandered O
in O
a O
short O
time O
the O
heritage O
that O
the O
central O
- O
left O
governments O
had O
left O
him O
: O

a O
situation O
in O
order O
of O
the O
public O
accounts O
. O

Mr O
Prodi B-PER
then O
expressed O
his O
no O
on O
possible O
changes O
to O
the O
par O
condice O
before O
the O
elections O
. O

He O
asked O
Ciampi B-PER
Prodi B-PER
to O
ensure O
the O
pluralism O
of O
information O
, O
in O
particular O
that O
offered O
by O
the O
radio O
and O
television O
system O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
change O
the O
rules O
when O
the O
game O
is O
about O
to O
end O
. O

But O
his O
day O
also O
recorded O
a O
tail O
of O
controversy O
. O

Inside O
the O
alliance O
, O
on O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
counter O
- O
maneuver O
on O
the O
tax O
, O
contested O
by O
some O
leaders O
, O
including O
the O
socialist O
Boselli B-PER
, O
because O
it O
is O
a O
mistake O
to O
go O
down O
on O
Berlusconi B-PER
's O
ground O
, O
talking O
about O
tax O
cuts O
. O

There O
were O
no O
lack O
of O
blows O
beyond O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
center O
- O
left O
, O
such O
as O
the O
burst O
of O
rainy O
criticism O
on O
Prodi B-PER
accused O
by O
the O
Cdl B-ORG
of O
having O
exploited O
the O
conversation O
with O
Ciampi B-PER
. O

And O
Berlusconi B-PER
's O
trip O
to O
the O
address O
of O
the O
Gad B-ORG
leader O
, O
certainly O
taken O
into O
account O
, O
who O
replies O
to O
him O
in O
a O
hard O
face O
: O

" O
I O
think O
of O
Prodi B-PER
's O
criticism O
of O
all O
the O
evil O
that O
is O
possible O
. O
" O

At O
the O
demonstration O
of O
the O
unions O
against O
the O
financial O
, O
Prodi B-PER
had O
launched O
the O
message O
: O

It O
is O
a O
very O
important O
beginning O
because O
it O
is O
a O
clear O
demonstration O
of O
the O
state O
of O
uneasiness O
with O
regard O
to O
government O
policy O
. O

Soon O
after O
, O
the O
professor O
goes O
up O
to O
the O
Quirinale O
and O
later O
, O
to O
the O
journalists O
, O
reports O
the O
meaning O
of O
his O
speech O
to O
Ciampi B-PER
: O

The O
game O
of O
democracy O
- O
he O
says O
referring O
to O
par O
conditio O
- O
is O
too O
important O
for O
someone O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
cheat O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
change O
the O
rules O
when O
the O
game O
is O
about O
to O
end O
. O

The O
rules O
of O
par O
conditio O
are O
the O
only O
defense O
, O
albeit O
partial O
, O
against O
the O
superpower O
of O
the O
media O
and O
for O
this O
reason O
must O
be O
guarded O
. O

The O
manipulation O
to O
unified O
networks O
of O
the O
past O
few O
days O
fully O
justifies O
our O
alarm O
. O

But O
to O
the O
head O
of O
state O
, O
Prodi B-PER
points O
out O
that O
the O
government O
's O
maneuver O
must O
be O
remade O
completely O
because O
it O
is O
unfounded O
. O

But O
Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
, O
from O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
does O
not O
hide O
his O
irritation O
. O

The O
premier O
touched O
on O
the O
living O
, O
precisely O
on O
the O
cutting O
of O
taxes O
and O
the O
revision O
of O
the O
par O
condicio O
, O
is O
not O
there O
. O

And O
it O
finds O
in O
this O
the O
support O
of O
the O
whole O
Cdl B-ORG
. O

Its O
sinking O
from O
Madrid B-LOC
is O
in O
fact O
preceded O
and O
followed O
by O
the O
waterfall O
criticism O
especially O
of O
An B-ORG
, O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
and O
Lega B-ORG
to O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Gad B-ORG
. O

And O
the O
Cdl B-ORG
also O
responds O
to O
a O
harsh O
snout O
on O
the O
strike O
, O
considered O
" O
political O
" O
, O
i.e. O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
Olive B-ORG
tree I-ORG
. O

The O
only O
soft O
one O
is O
Follini B-PER
who O
says O
to O
respect O
the O
protesters O
, O
but O
not O
to O
share O
the O
motivations O
. O

Institutional O
reforms O
and O

are O
the O
main O

last O
night O
in O

I O
read O

statement O

with O
all O
due O

realizing O
that O
this O
is O
a O
very O
delicate O
issue O

I O
dare O
say O
that O
in O

judgment O
you O
can O
not O
cling O

a O
" O
close O

Our O
unbearable O

must O
be O
lifted O
high O

But O
let O
's O
go O
back O
to O
the O
official O
statement O

" O
We O
have O
always O
asked O
for O
a O
clear O
and O
objective O
judgment O
and O
despite O
the O
perplexities O
of O
many O
, O
we O
have O
also O
tried O
to O
understand O
the O
reasons O
that O
accompanied O
the O
decision O
to O
transfer O
the O
process O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC

" O

The O
news O
that O
comes O
from O
America B-LOC
, O
however O
, O
literally O
leave O
us O
unspeakable O
surprises O
. O

Absolution O
is O
a O
fist O
in O
the O
stomach O
because O
this O
, O
contrary O
to O
many O
other O
unresolved O
cases O
, O
has O
always O
seemed O
a O
linear O
process O
: O

evidence O
of O
the O
facts O
is O
in O
the O
chronicle O
of O
the O
days O
immediately O
following O
that O
tragic O
February O
three O
of O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
when O
an O
American O
plane O

which O
we O
do O
not O

the O
twenty O

These O

Dellai B-PER

are O
facts O
not O

" O
Today O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
frankly O
inappropriate O
to O

that O
perhaps O
anyone O

while O
the O
role O
of O
the O
Board B-ORG

becomes O
decidedly O
marginal O
. O

A O
no O
of O

instead O
arrived O
at O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
an O
appointment O
that O
also O
involved O

, O
the O
Montecitorio O

morning O

The O
passages O
that O
led O
to O
the O
new O
solution O
for O
the O
appointment O
of O
the O
governor O
were O
not O
simple O
and O
some O
element O
of O
confusion O
emerged O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
which O
approved O
the O
amendments O
proposed O
by O
Tremonti B-PER
and O
authorized O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
votes O
of O
confidence O
( O
a O
no O
regulation O
of O
Casini B-PER
prevented O
the O

from O
placing O
only O
one O
confidence O
in O
everything O
) O
. O

" O
The O
criterion O
of O
appointment O
of O
the O
Governor O
of O
Bankitalia B-ORG
does O
not O
change O
, O
" O
says O
Prime O
Minister O
Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
, O
leaving O
the O
Chamber O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Council O
. O

In O
the O
press O
conference O
convened O
shortly O
after O
, O
the O
Minister O
of O
Economics O
Giulio B-PER
Tremonti I-PER
gives O
different O
indications O
: O

the O
proposal O
of O
the O
governor O
is O
made O
by O
the O
government O
, O
after O
consulting O
the O
Board B-ORG
of O
Governors O
of O
Bankitalia B-ORG
, O
to O
the O
Quirinale O
who O
signs O
its O
appointment O
. O

Same O
procedure O
for O
revoking O
the O
governor O
. O

The O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
was O
preceded O
in O
the O
morning O
by O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
Quirinale O
in O
Tremonti B-PER
, O
accompanied O
by O
the O
Undersecretary O
of O
the O
Presidency B-ORG
of I-ORG
the O
Council O
Gianni B-PER
Letta I-PER
. O

To O
Carlo B-PER
Azeglio I-PER
Ciampi I-PER
Tremonti B-PER
illustrates O
his O
proposal O
: O

the O
appointment O
of O
the O
governor O
proposed O
by O
the O
government O
, O
with O
the O
binding O
opinion O
of O
a O
qualified O
parliamentary O
majority O
. O

A O
solution O
that O
Ciampi B-PER
does O
not O
like O
because O
it O
would O
win O
too O
much O
the O
future O
Governor O
of O
Bankitalia B-ORG
to O
political O
choices O
. O

More O
autonomy O
seems O
to O
guarantee O
the O
solution O
then O
adopted O
, O
because O
it O
would O
strengthen O
the O
role O
of O
the O
Quirinale O
who O
would O
instead O
have O
less O
agility O
of O
intervention O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
pronouncement O
by O
Parliament B-ORG
. O

The O
opinion O
of O
the O
Chambers B-ORG
therefore O
emerges O
from O
the O
government O
proposal O
and O
the O
solution O
seems O
not O
to O
displease O
the O
opposition O
, O
although O
clear O
is O
the O
hostility O
towards O
many O
other O
aspects O
of O
the O
reform O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
, O
all O
confirmed O
the O
novelty O
of O
the O
government O
amendments O
. O

The O
governor O
's O
term O
of O
office O
is O
six O
years O
renewable O
: O

also O
the O
Directory O
, O
which O
assumes O
wider O
powers O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
collegiality O
required O
by O
the O
ECB B-ORG
, O
is O
six O
years O
in O
term O
, O
but O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
appointed O
by O
the O
Board B-ORG
of O
Governors O
of O
Bankitalia B-ORG
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
fake O
in O
the O
budget O
. O

The O
government O
proposes O
the O
lower O
standards O
approved O
by O
the O
Chamber B-ORG
with O
the O
first O
reading O
of O
the O
Savings O
Act O
, O
which O
are O
however O
a O
little O
more O
stringent O
than O
the O
current O
legislation O
. O

Therefore O
, O
for O
false O
social O
communications O
stop O
up O
to O
two O
years O
and O
lower O
thresholds O
for O
the O
tightening O
of O
the O
sanctions O
provided O
for O
against O
those O
who O
cause O
serious O
harm O
. O

Nocution O
is O
such O
when O
it O
has O
concerned O
a O
number O
of O
savers O
greater O
than O
0,1 O
per O
thousand O
of O
the O
population O
or O
has O
destroyed O
value O
for O
an O
entity O
greater O
than O
0,1 O
per O
thousand O
of O
GDP O
. O

But O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
fake O
money O
in O
the O
budget O
there O
are O
two O
votes O
of O
confidence O
, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
the O
secret O
votes O
that O
should O
be O
cast O
, O
since O
the O
article O
also O
refers O
to O
sanctions O
and O
detentions O

on O

Del B-PER
Piero I-PER

" O
My O
assessments O
in O
the O
choice O
of O
training O
- O
Ancelotti B-PER
explains O
- O
are O
technical O
and O
tactical O
, O
not O
psychological O
. O
" O

It O
counts O
the O
condition O
of O
the O

the O
way O
he O
worked O
during O

I O
do O

It O
's O
true O
, O
Inzaghi B-PER

scored O
much O
, O
but O
he O
scored O
5 O

about O
Kovacevic B-PER

On O
the O
other O
hand O

Ancelotti B-PER
explains O
that O
much O
will O
also O
depend O
on O
the O
type O
of O
game O
we O
want O
to O
play O
. O

It O
is O
understood O
that O
the O
technician O
would O
like O
to O
present O
an O
aggressive O
Juve B-ORG
, O
which O
embellishes O
in O
the O

" O
The O

us O
after O

on O
the O

notes O

, O
Parma B-LOC
lacked O
9 O
players O
who O
will O

anything O

It O
will O
be O
a O
challenge O
- O
Ancelotti B-PER
confirms O
- O
that O
will O
say O
if O
the O
Juve B-ORG
will O
be O
the O
protagonist O
like O
last O
year O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
successive O
ones O

We O
get O
there O

given O
the O

we O
had O
only O

Ancelotti B-PER
also O
knows O
well O
that O
his O
fortune O
is O
linked O
to O
that O
of O
the O

But O
he O
consoles O
himself O
by O
looking O

perfectly O
organized O
by O

The O
success O
in O

laughed O
at O
Bertolini B-PER

winner O
for O
the O
fifth O

time O
in O
Levico B-LOC

One O
hundred O

at O
the O

four O

the O

Caldonazzo B-LOC

On O
the O

a O
quartet O
with O
Ballerin B-PER

Benedetti B-PER

Tomaselli B-PER
transits O
with O
about O
ten O

In O

In O
the O
third O

decisive O

a O
peremptory O
action O

about O
ten O

produced O
in O
a O
new O
extension O
to O
which O
bertolini O

then O
Tomasi B-PER
respond O
first O
. O

Thus O
a O
trio O
of O
" O
90 O
pieces O

is O
formed O
that O
leaves O
no O

a O
little O

in O

It O
is O

him O

I O

out O

the O
admittance O

Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
does O
not O
break O
down O

" O
You O
will O
soon O
know O
my O
intentions O
" O

Since O
the O
Greens B-ORG
already O
see O
him O
as O
the O
next O
pensioner O
, O
if O
they O
imagine O
it O
already O
, O
they O
do O
it O
to O
say O
, O
to O
the O
gardens O
to O
feed O
the O
pigeons O
, O
we O
asked O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
if O
he O
really O
intends O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O
race O
. O

Not O
to O
reappear O
. O

" O
I O
will O
soon O
dissolve O
the O
reserves O
- O
he O
told O
us O
yesterday O
morning O
- O
I O
think O
already O
next O
week O
or O
in O
about O
ten O
days O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
an O
exact O
date O
but O
it O
will O
be O
soon O
. O

I O
know O
perfectly O
well O
the O
rules O
of O
politics O
so O
I O
'll O
say O
my O
intentions O
soon O
. O

And O
what O
does O
Valduga B-PER
Ballardini B-PER
say O
about O
the O
possible O
and O
probable O
candidacy O
? O

I O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
a O
dinner O
during O
the O
election O
campaign O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
once O
we O
went O
to O
the O
pizzeria O
but O
we O
paid O
strictly O
to O
the O
Romans O
. O

No O
assessments O
in O
short O
, O
and O
also O
from O
this O
it O
is O
understood O
that O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
, O
as O
he O
said O
himself O
, O
knows O
the O
" O
mechanical O
" O
of O
politics O
: O

Attacking O
now O
a O
possible O
candidate O
mayor O
opponent O
means O
legitimizing O
him O
before O
the O
time O
, O
unwittingly O
giving O
him O
a O
push O
and O
also O
giving O
him O
the O
opportunity O
to O
test O
the O
reactions O
of O
the O
enemy O
. O

So O
Ballardini B-PER
avoids O
answering O
, O
he O
gets O
away O
with O
a O
joke O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
although O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
summer O
, O
we O
are O
at O
an O
important O
political O
step O
: O

the O
expectation O
of O
yes O
or O
no O
by O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
has O
a O
strategic O
importance O
. O

It O
can O
complicate O
or O
make O
things O
easier O
in O
the O
left O
center O
from O
anywhere O
you O
look O
at O
them O
. O

If O
he O
remains O
in O
the O
race O
his O
would O
be O
a O
strong O
candidacy O
but O
in O
the O
coalition O
would O
arise O
problems O
: O

Quite O
hardly O
Ppi B-ORG
, O
green B-ORG
, O
lay O
people O
would O
accept O
again O
a O

If O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
you O
leave O
the O
left O

you O
will O
have O
to O
find O
a O
strong O

The O

by O

to O
arrive O
at O
the O

with O
the O
urns O
of O
2003 O
with O
a O
unique O
list O
of O
the O
left O
is O
announced O
rather O
difficult O
. O

For O
sure O
, O
everything O
will O
be O
uphill O
. O

But O
the O
proposal O
of O
Pinter B-PER
- O
notes O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
, O
secretary O
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
- O
is O
on O
the O
whole O
positive O
and O
the O
road O
that O
has O
traced O
is O
certainly O
acceptable O
. O

The O
leader O
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
, O
probably O
, O
would O
have O
preferred O
a O
little O
more O
courage O
. O

His O
bullet O
is O
yes O
the O
unique O
list O
, O
but O
of O
the O
entire O
coalition O
, O
not O
only O
of O
the O
left O
: O

If O
he O
works O
for O
the O
unit O
of O
the O
left O
- O
he O
admits O
- O
I O
work O
for O
the O
unit O
of O
the O
left O
center O
. O

The O
road O
is O
that O
, O
let O
's O
see O
if O
we O
stop O
at O
an O
intermediate O
stage O
or O
if O
we O
get O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
it O
. O

But O
, O
just O
to O
clarify O
, O
Bondi B-PER
ensures O
that O
I O
, O
on O
the O
left O
hand O
side O
, O
would O
still O
put O
the O
signature O
on O
it O
. O

More O
critical O
Mauro B-PER
Leveghi I-PER
, O
council O
member O
and O
exponent O
of O
the O
Sdi B-ORG
: O

Pinter B-PER
's O
proposal O
is O
a O
difficult O
one O
to O
achieve O
. O

Not O
impossible O
, O
but O
difficult O
. O

Difficult O
because O
, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
clear O
the O
field O
from O
any O
preliminary O
attitude O
towards O
those O
who O
, O
on O
the O
left O
, O
think O
otherwise O
. O

The O
reference O
is O
of O
course O
to O
the O
skirmishes O
on O
the O
reform O
of O
the O
electoral O
law O
of O
recent O
days O
. O

" O
There O
can O
be O
no O

of O

when O
the O

And O
then O
: O

First O
of O
all O
, O
let O
us O
find O
an O
agreement O
on O
the O
electoral O
law O
, O
without O
resorting O
to O
blackmail O
. O

This O
, O
at O
least O
, O
at O
Pinter B-PER
Leveghi B-PER
recognizes O
it O
: O

In O
fact O
, O
he O
poses O
himself O
with O
a O
method O
of O
dialogue O
that O
is O
very O
different O
from O
what O
I O
have O
seen O
adopted O
at O
the O
Ds B-ORG
in O
recent O
times O
. O

With O
these O
bases O
, O
it O
assures O
the O

, O
you O
can O
discuss O
. O

Also O

The O

We O
asked O

, O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
experts O
in O
the O
work O
of O

He O
remembers O
above O
all O
a O
piece O
, O
really O
valuable O
from O
the O
historical O
point O
of O
view O
, O
which O
was O
given O
to O
Bettino B-PER
right O
here O
in O
Rovereto B-LOC

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
1980s O
- O
says O
Scudiero B-PER
- O
I O
went O
to O
Milan B-LOC
at O
Craxi B-PER
's O
house O
to O
see O
some O
paintings O
by O
Depero B-PER
. O

I O
had O
seen O
them O
in O
a O
decor O
magazine O
and O
asked O
the O
family O
to O
see O
them O
. O

There O
were O
ten O
or O
a O
little O
more O
, O
arranged O
on O
a O
long O
wall O
that O
stood O
behind O
his O
work O
table O
. O

He O
was O
n't O
there O
that O
day O
, O
if O
I O
remember O
correctly O
there O
was O
the O
wife O
who O
also O
asked O
me O
an O
opinion O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
unbutton O
so O
much O
. O

They O
were O
beautiful O
but O
were O
not O
historical O
works O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
had O
been O
purchased O
at O
the O
Cortina B-ORG
Gallery I-ORG
in O
Milan B-LOC
. O

But O
one O
came O
from O
here O
, O
from O
Rovereto B-LOC
. O

That O
's O
a O
very O
interesting O
work O
. O

A O
" O
La O
Panthera O
" O
which O
was O
given O
to O
Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER
in O
January O
of O
' O
89 O
here O
when O
the O
then O
secretary O
of O
the O
Psi B-ORG
came O
to O
visit O
the O
Mart B-ORG
. O

The O
greatest O
exhibition O
of O
the O
artist O
was O
inaugurated O
, O
I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
curators O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
one O
that O
started O
the O
Mart B-ORG
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
it O
was O
given O
, O
I O
think O
by O
the O
Psi B-ORG
Federation I-ORG
, O
to O
Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER
the O
china O
that O
belonged O
to O
a O
collector O
from O
Trentino O
. O

An O
important O
work O
of O
' O
13 O
because O
it O
belongs O
to O
the O
Depero B-PER
that O
was O
about O
to O
pass O
to O
Futurism O
. O

Among O
the O
things O
I O
saw O
in O
Milan B-LOC
were O
, O
besides O
paintings O
, O
some O
" O
sprinkles O
" O
, O
creations O
of O
the O
artist O
derived O
from O
the O
initial O
drawing O
. O

I O
remember O
a O
" O
Sticks O
and O
Sticks O
. O
" O

However O
Craxi B-PER
Depero B-PER
liked O
it O
very O
much O
, O
he O
was O
one O
who O
understood O
Futurist O
art O
. O

He O
had O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
connoisseur O
regarding O
Fortunato B-PER
Depero I-PER
. O

And O
in O
fact O
the O
Panther O
is O
a O
connoisseur O
's O
piece O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
economic O
value O
but O
artistic O
above O
all O
. O

It O
was O
a O
Depero B-PER
- O
says O
Scudiero B-PER
- O
still O
expressionist O
, O
the O
futurist O
traces O
begin O
to O
see O
in O
these O
stars O
" O
. O

Beyond O
the O
historical O
- O
artistic O
aspects O
today O
is O
a O
memory O
of O
an O
era O
recalled O
to O
memory O
by O
the O
article O
of O
the O
Corriere B-ORG
that O
has O
focused O
on O
the O
Depero O
of O
the O
villa O
of O
Hammamet B-LOC
, O
describing O
them O
as O
a O
treasure O
" O
. O

That O
treasure O
is O
that O
in O
the O
years O
when O
Craxi B-PER
was O
the O
Evil O
was O
described O
in O
the O
press O
and O
on O
TV O
as O
something O
galactic O
: O

We O
even O
spoke O
of O
a O
thousand O
billion O
! O

Now O
, O
instead O
, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
the O
Tunisian O
villa O
is O
not O
much O
then O
. O

So O
goes O
the O
world O
or O
at O
least O
Italy B-LOC
. O

From O
the O
visit O
of O
Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER
to O
Rovereto B-LOC
remains O
this O
memory O
, O
the O
gift O
of O
the O
Panther O
of O

the O

It O

Do O
you O

the O
case O

that O
from O
the O
Province B-LOC
has O
obtained O
a O
substantial O
contribution O
in O
the O
field O

about O
twenty O
kilometers O
from O
what O

From O

a O
few O

the O
Provincial O

Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER

colleague O
Denis B-PER
Bertolini I-PER
) O
had O
left O
to O
submit O
a O
question O
to O
President O
Pallaoro B-PER

The O
objective O
was O
to O
know O
the O
precise O
list O
of O
all O
the O
investments O
made O
and O
those O
planned O
with O
the O

Bondi B-PER
, O
in O
particular O
, O
wonders O
about O
the O
aims O
of O
a O
series O
of O
very O
varied O
and O
not O
always O
immediately O
attributable O
to O
a O
general O
plan O
to O
relaunch O
Monte B-LOC
Bondone I-LOC

Well O
, O
the O
answer O
given O
by O
the O
city O
council O
member O
to O
the O
programming O
Gianluca B-PER
Salvatori I-PER
emerges O
very O
interesting O
data O
. O

Private O
investment O
applications O
considered O
to O
be O
consistent O
by O
the O
public O
body O
are O
472 O
, O
amounting O
to O
almost O
Euros O
107 O
million O
. O

A O
large O
part O
for O
the O
sectors O
that O
are O
universally O
considered O
to O
be O
driving O
for O
the O
relaunch O
of O
Bondone B-LOC
: O

tourism O
( O
76 O
million O

slopes O
and O

( O
11 O
million O
) O
and O
agritourism O
( O
2 O
million O
) O
. O

However O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
, O
within O
the O
contributions O
that O
Piazza B-LOC
Dante I-LOC
is O
elating O
to O
bring O
back O
to O
life O
the O
mountain O
of O
Trento B-LOC
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
various O
hundreds O
of O
euros O
for O
the O
replacement O
of O
boilers O
and O
for O
the O
reconstruction O
of O
the O
facades O
of O
the O
houses O
, O
there O
are O
requests O
for O
contribution O
for O
640 O
thousand O
euros O
that O
will O
serve O
for O
the O
reconstruction O
of O
supporting O
walls O
, O
fences O
and O
construction O
of O
armed O
lands O
. O

Not O
only O
that O
. O

Nearly O
€ O
1 O
million O
and O
€ O
100,000 O
have O
been O
requested O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
new O
orchards O
, O
the O
construction O
of O
irrigation O
systems O
and O
anti- O
magnifying O
roofs O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
think O
of O
a O
cherry O
plant O
in O
Bondone B-LOC
, O
near O
the O
slopes O
, O
maybe O
positioned O
so O
that O
the O
skiers O
do O
slalom O
in O
the O
middle O
you O
are O
wrong O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Sopramonte B-LOC
and O
Sardagna B-LOC
, O
which O
are O
still O
part O
of O
the O
district B-LOC
of I-LOC
Bondone I-LOC
or O
are O
closely O
linked O
to O
it O
, O
the O
new O
crops O
will O
also O
rise O
in O
the O
plain O
, O
for O
example O
in O
Romagnano B-LOC
. O

Thus O
on O
the O
table O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
's O
Trade O
Service O
came O
also O
the O
request O
for O
a O

already O
been O
declared O

as O
it O
falls O
within O
the O

present O
the O

I O
would O
like O
the O

to O
be O
interested O
in O
such O
important O
matters O

Giovanna B-ORG
Fadanelli I-ORG
( O
Margherita B-ORG
) O
, O
chairman O
of O
the O
Committee O
on O
Culture O
, O
certainly O
does O
not O
send O
her O
to O
tell O
the O
provincial O
councilor O
Margherita B-PER
Cogo I-PER
that O
the O
other O
day O
she O
presented O
in O
preview O
the O
guidelines O
of O
the O
draft O
law O
that O
will O
shortly O
come O
in O
. O

He O
asked O
why O
in O
view O
of O
such O
a O
significant O
passage O
the O
participation O
of O
the O
city O
was O
not O
required O
. O

" O
I O
think O
that O
the O
capital O
at O
this O
juncture O
would O
have O
had O
something O
important O
to O
say O
, O
if O
only O
to O
concert O
the O
themes O
and O
objectives O
of O
this O
new O
rule O
" O
. O

Last O
night O
in O
the O
municipal O
culture O
committee O
was O
present O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Federation B-ORG
of I-ORG
choirs I-ORG
Sergio B-PER
Franceschinelli I-PER
to O
tell O
the O
vitality O
of O
the O
33 O
choirs O
( O
for O
a O
total O
of O
878 O
chorists O
) O
living O
in O
the O
territory O
of O
Trento B-LOC
. O

A O
constantly O
growing O
reality O
that O
has O
been O
able O
to O
involve O
young O
people O
while O
maintaining O
a O
link O
with O
the O
traditional O
world O
. O

On O
the O
controversy O
with O
the O
Cogo B-PER
Franceschinelli B-PER
preferred O
to O
glissare O
, O
explaining O
however O
that O
he O
had O
sent O
to O
Piazza B-LOC
Dante I-LOC
a O
rather O
harsh O
reply O
to O
the O
statements O
issued O
by O
the O
city O
council O
member O
at O
the B-ORG
Adige I-ORG
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
perhaps O
in O
response O
to O
the O
Cogo B-PER
asking O
for O
more O
space O
to O
modern O
culture O
, O
the O
choirs O
will O
start O
shortly O
with O
a O
project O
for O
the O
rediscovery O
of O
the O
popular O
tradition O
of O
materials O
and O
ancient O
crafts O
( O
cellar O
, O
plow O
, O
mill O
) O
. O

Maybe O
stormy O
, O
but O
at O
least O
with O
the O
Province B-LOC
there O
are O
relationships O
. O

With O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
, O
instead O
- O
continues O
the O
president O
, O
- O
they O
are O
rather O
occasional O
. O

For O
our O
part O
there O
is O
full O
willingness O
to O
cooperate O
, O
but O
great O
demands O
we O
have O
never O
had O
. O

The O
example O
that O
Francheschinelli B-PER
made O
is O
very O
topical O
: O

" O
For O
the O
initiative O
" O
Trent B-LOC
alpine O
city O
" O
we O
could O
have O
participated O
, O
but O
no O
one O
has O
ever O
asked O
us O
" O
. O

These O
statements O
made O
the O
whole O
committee O
, O
convinced O
that O
with O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
cultural O
plan O
last O
year O
, O
the O
city O
administration O
had O
set O
in O
motion O
to O
carry O
out O
a O
survey O
of O
the O
associative O
realities O
, O
groups O
, O
individuals O
who O
do O
cultural O
activities O
on O
the O
territory O
. O

It O
can O
be O
said O
- O
it O
has O
synthesized O
Diano B-PER
, O
supported O
from O
Fadanelli B-PER
and O
Ragozzino B-PER
- O
that O
the O
plan O
has O
remained O
only O
on O
the O
paper O
. O

Among O
what O
had O
been O
established O
, O
the O
first O
point O
was O
the O
establishment O
of O
an O
observatory O
to O
monitor O
the O
cultural O
ferment O
of O
the O
city O
. O

We O
find O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
Councillor O
Bertoldi B-PER
has O
not O
contacted O
anyone O
, O
not O
even O
a O
structured O
and O
rooted O
federation O
like O
that O
of O
the O
choirs O
. O

yesterday O
morning O
at O
the O
news O
of O
the O
new O
postponement O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
was O
thrown O
into O
a O
swearing O
: O

But O
these O
are O
n't O
serious O
. O

Immediately O
after O
the O
tone O
of O
the O
phone O
call O
between O
him O
and O
Stefano B-PER
Albergoni I-PER
, O
secretary O
of O

was O
no O
less O
tense O
: O

That O
's O
enough O
, O
they O
ca O
n't O
make O
fun O
of O
us O
anymore O
. O

Thus O
was O
urgently O
convened O
a O
summit O
of O
the O
Trentino O
center O
- O
left O
that O
decided O
to O
give O
a O
peremptory O
ultimatum O
: O

The O
agreement B-ORG
must O
be O
decided O
by O
23 O
January O
at O
the O
latest O
. O

The O
agreement B-ORG
's O
decision O
to O
postpone O
everything O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
month O
has O
in O
fact O
also O
upset O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
negotiations O
with O
Bolzano B-LOC
, O
where O
a O
restricted O
summit O
was O
convened O
for O
yesterday O
afternoon O
, O
then O
updated O
to O
Friday O
. O

the O
fly O
to O
the O
nose O
had O
also O
jumped O
to O
the O
Svp B-ORG
, O
which O
did O
not O
like O
the O
tactics O
of O
the O
dilatory O
cousins O
and O
that O
with O
the O
center O
- O
left O
Trentino O
could O
decide O
to O
make O
a O
regional O
junta O
ignoring O
the O
Patt B-ORG
. O

Although O
on O
this O
side O
the O
Volkspartei B-ORG
will O
first O
have O
to O
solve O
the O
fracture O
of O
the O
South O
Tyrolean O
majority O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
relations O
with O
the O
center O
- O
left O
Bolzano O
were O
abruptly O
interrupted O
. O

To O
examine O
the O
issue O
- O
Patt B-ORG
yesterday O
they O
had O
found O
themselves O
in O
the O
office O
of O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
Roberto B-PER
Pinter I-PER
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
, O
the O
same O
Dellai B-PER
with O
Claudio B-PER
Molinari I-PER
for O
the O

Andrea B-PER
Puecher I-PER
and O
Sergio B-PER
Muraro I-PER
for O
the O

Dini I-ORG
. O

At O
the O
end O
a O
statement O
was O
issued O
in O
which O
the O
center O
- O
left O
expresses O
: O

" O
great O
concern O
" O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
political O
and O
policy O
- O
oriented O
confrontation O
with O
the O
Pact B-ORG
has O
been O
broadly O
positive O
so O
far O
. O

The O
forces O
of O
the O
centre O
- O
left O
point O
out O
that O
by O
common O
agreement O
with O
all O
provincial O
leaders O
, O
including O
the O
Patt B-ORG
, O
the O
next O
meeting O
of O
the O
Council O
was O
scheduled O
for O
Tuesday O
, O
26 O
January O
. O

In O
view O
of O
these O
deadlines O
, O
the O
coalition O
of O
the O
centre O
- O
left O
considers O
that O
by O
Saturday O
23 O
January O
the O
agreement B-ORG
, O
as O
previously O
publicly O
announced O
and O
agreed O
, O
must O
be O
decided O
. O

It O
is O
hoped O
that O
this O
decision O
will O
be O
taken O
positively O
, O
supplementing O
the O
assumptions O
of O
agreement O
that O
have O
been O
being O
drawn O
up O
collectively O
for O
weeks O
now O
. O

Otherwise O
- O
continues O
the O
note O
- O
first O
of O
all O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
institutional O
obligations O
and O
in O
consistency O
with O
the O
responsibility O
assumed O
in O
front O
of O
the O
electorate O
, O
taking O
into O
account O
also O
the O
serious O
disconcertment O
and O
disturbance O
that O
is O
emerging O
in O
the O
public O
opinion O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
the O
coalition O
of O
the O
center O
- O
left O
considers O
it O
necessary O
and O
improcrastinable O
to O
take O
all O
the O
political O
and O
institutional O
initiatives O
necessary O
for O
the O
proper O
functioning O
of O
the O
provincial O
council O
of O
Trentino O
and O
for O
the O
formation O
of O
provincial O
and O
regional O
governments O
. O

Out O
of O
metaphor O
the O
center O
- O
left O
intends O
to O
wait O
until O
Saturday O
, O
but O
then O
will O
begin O
to O
look O
around O
. O

Everyone O
denies O
that O
there O
are O
already O
other O
contacts O
in O
progress O
with O
the O
Center O
, O
but O
it O
is O
logical O
to O
expect O
that O
the O
coalition O
of O
Dellai B-PER
somehow O
tries O
to O
find O
an O
eighteenth O
indispensable O
vote O
in O
order O
to O
make O
the O
majority O
. O

At O
yesterday O
's O
meeting O
in O
Trentino B-ORG
tomorrow O
there O
was O
also O
the O
possibility O
of O
trying O
the O
way O
of O
the O
minority O
junta O
, O
but O
for O
now O
Dellai B-PER
does O
not O
want O
to O
hear O
about O
it O
. O

Hard O
was O
Roberto B-PER
Pinter I-PER
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
: O

We O
could O
not O
remain O
impassive O
before O
a O
deadline O
and O
an O
agreed O
document O
. O

To O
go O
along O
with O
a O
postponement O
was O
to O
go O
along O
with O
the O
eternal O
ambiguity O
of O
the O
agreement B-ORG
. O

In O
the O
evening O
came O
the O
reminder O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
with O
which O
you O
claim O
the O
presidency O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
. O

Pinter B-PER
answered O
: O

So O
who O
have O
we O
dealt O
with O
so O
far O
? O

And O
then O
, O
let O
's O
go O
, O
the O
Patt B-ORG
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
agree O
to O
start O
a O
reform O
process O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
and O
then O
want O
to O
lead O
it O
. O

And O
Dellai B-PER
did O
n't O
like O
the O
memo O
either O
: O

I O
hope O
that O

will O
at O

to O
make O
clarity O
but O
somehow O
also O
brought O
a O
cold O
shower O
. O

Clarity O
because O
it O
is O
now O
certain O
that O
the O
territorial O
party O
will O
not O
be O
there O
: O

Ds B-ORG

Margherita B-ORG
will O
show O
up O
together O
, O
with O

leading O
, O
as O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O

What O
about O
the O
cold O
shower O
? O

Yes O
, O
because O
it O
has O
been O
understood O
that O
the O
Volkspartei B-ORG
from O
Bolzano B-LOC
has O
a O
direct O
connection O
with O
Rome B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
Gianclaudio B-PER
Bressa I-PER
will O
have O
to O
be O
settled O
in O
the O
Regional B-ORG
Union I-ORG
, O
taking O
away O
space O
for O
a O
candidate O
in O
Trentino O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
more O
hope O
: O

If O
Bressa B-PER
himself O
was O
called O
to O
the O
government O
he O
could O
leave O
the O
post O
of O
deputy O
to O
the O
first O
of O
the O
unelected O
. O

AUTONOMISTS O
. O

The O
transition O
of O
the O
Pact B-ORG
from O
the O
Union B-ORG
' O
s O
proportional O
to O
Volkspartei B-ORG
now O
appears O
to O
be O
certain O
. O

The O
candidate O
could O
be O
Giacomo B-PER
Bezzi I-PER
( O
or O
Franco B-PER
Panizza I-PER
as O
an O
alternative O
) O
. O

The O
independenceists O
expected O
a O
different O
treatment O
from O
the O
Margaret B-ORG
and O
now O
the O
dream O
not O
even O
so O
secret O
is O
to O
have O
the O
fourth O
member O
of O
the O
Alpine B-ORG
Star I-ORG
elected O
and O
to O
take O
him O
away O
from O
the O
Union B-ORG
. O

A O
way O
to O
weigh O
once O
and O
for O
all O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
. O

Giacomo B-PER
Bezzi I-PER
, O
however O
, O
denies O
any O
warlike O
intent O
: O

We O
had O
guaranteed O
our O
presence O
under O
two O
conditions O
: O

that O
the O
autonomous O
reunification O
was O
carried O
out O
and O
that O
there O
was O
a O
project O
with O
Margherita B-ORG
and O
Ds B-ORG
. O

Let O
's O
not O
change O
our O
mind O
. O

But O
the O
space O
conquered O
by O
Bressa B-PER
with O
the O
blessing O
of O
Prodi B-PER
risks O
making O
the O
race O
to O
Rome B-LOC
of O
Civic B-ORG
Trentino I-ORG
much O
more O
difficult O
. O

The O
Patt B-ORG
that O
removes O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
: O

It O
would O
be O
a O
mockery O
for O
those O
who O
wanted O
to O
exclude O
it O

On O

Since O

, O
however O
, O
Siric B-ORG

failed O

As O
early O
as O

however O

On O

On O

, O
the O

Continuing O
the O

the O

activated O
the O

that O

In O
the O

- O
the O

the O

governed O
at O
its O
execution O

This O
is O
a O
genuine O

a O

clause O
is O
included O
which O
has O
been O
expressly O
recalled O

of O
11 O
April O

12 O
June O
2001 O
. O

The O

therefore O
considers O
that O
the O
question O
which O
is O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
appeal O
is O
removed O
from O
the O

And O
so O
it O
happened O
, O
reaching O

The O

therefore O
, O
canceled O

in O

The O

given O
the O
contracts O
( O
to O
biennial O
value O
) O
to O
the O
maximum O
downside O
, O
i.e. O
to O
the O
cooperative O
that O
wanted O
less O

, O
without O
looking O
in O
any O
way O
at O
the O
dignity O
of O
the O
workers O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O

. O

The O

a O

of O

( O
respectively O
of O
124 O
thousand O

162 O

) O
. O

But O
there O
is O
more O
: O

If O
our O
calculations O
are O
correct O
- O
say O
trade O
unionists O
Roland B-PER
Caramelle I-PER
and O
Ezio B-PER
Casagranda I-PER
- O
the O
total O
annual O
hours O
worked O
by O
the O
five O
workers O
in O
charge O
of O
public O
offices O
is O
6.993 O
hours O
. O

Just O
a O
brief O
reasoning O
to O
understand O
that O
then O
the O
employees O
take O
8,88 O
euros O
per O
hour O
( O
124 O
thousand O
divided O
by O
6,993 O
divided O
by O
2 O
) O
and O
not O
14,01 O
euros O
which O
would O
be O
the O
minimum O
hourly O
cost O
according O
to O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Labour O
. O

" O
We O
do O
not O
understand O
- O
say O
Casagranda B-PER
and O
Calculator O
Candies B-PER
at O
hand O
- O
how O
the O
municipal O
offices O
have O
done O
the O
accounts O
. O
" O

The O
cleaning O
of O
those O
buildings O
are O
always O
the O
same O
, O
every O
year O
: O

then O
, O
since O
the O
municipality B-LOC
has O
saved O
on O
the O
costs O
one O
must O
tell O
whether O
it O
has O
reduced O
the O
hours O
of O
work O
and O
whether O
the O
hours O
have O
been O
taken O
away O
, O
where O
they O
have O
been O
taken O
away O
. O

Or O
maybe O
there O
's O
a O
new O
car O
washing O
glass O
by O
itself O
. O

If O
not O
, O
we O
are O
faced O
with O
a O
worsening O
of O
working O
conditions O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service O
rendered O
. O

The O
error O
is O
upstream O
, O
and O
it O
is O
of O
the O
Municipality B-LOC
. O

In O
short O
, O
the O
Filcams B-ORG
Cgil I-ORG
calls O
in O
question O
the O
mayor O
Claudio B-PER
Molinari I-PER
( O

also O

not O
so O
indirectly O
, O
the O

( O

. O

The O

in O

has O
a O

character O

From O
both O
the O
Cgil B-ORG
expects O
a O

In O
fact O

these O

The O

Ljubljana B-LOC
with O
great O
statements O
of O
trust O
, O
friendship O
, O
mutual O
invitations O
and O
future O
collaboration O
, O
but O
leaving O
far O
away O
the O
positions O
of O
Washington B-LOC

Moscow B-LOC
on O
the O
space O
shield O
, O
central O
point O
of O
the O
agenda O
of O
the O
talks O
. O
During O
the O
press O
conference O
followed O
by O
talks O
in O
the O
castle O
of O
Brdo O
, O
Putin B-PER
reiterated O
that O
for O
Russia B-LOC
the O
framework O
of O
world O
security O
has O
as O
milestone O
the O
Abm O
Treaty O
of O
1972 O
. O

" O
Every O
unilateral O
initiative O
- O
he O
added O
- O
could O
cause O
many O
complications O
" O
. O

Like O
his O
American O
colleague O
, O
Putin B-PER
did O
not O
hide O
the O
differences O
that O
emerged O
in O
the O
course O
of O
talks O
which O
, O
however O
, O
he O
described O
as O
very O
open O
and O
very O
interesting O
. O

We O
have O
assessed O
the O
past O
, O
the O
present O
and O
the O
future O
of O
our O
countries O
- O
said O
the O
Russian O
President O
- O
we O
have O
found O
an O
excellent O
basis O
for O
developing O
our O
cooperation O
, O
but O
we O
can O
not O
overcome O
the O
differences O
that O
exist O
between O
us O
at O
a O
time O
. O

" O
We O
will O
start O
from O
those O
elements O
that O
unite O
us O
, O
the O
threats O
must O
be O
defined O
exactly O
and O
it O
is O
better O
to O
do O
so O
together O
" O
, O
added O
Putin B-PER
who O
announced O
the O
opening O
of O
a O
negotiating O
table O
on O
security O
that O
will O
be O
entrusted O
to O
the O
Foreign O
and O
Defence O
Ministers O
. O

Bush B-PER
also O
stressed O
the O
difficulties O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
showed O
that O
he O
considered O
them O
as O
a O
starting O
point O
. O

" O
We O
speak O
differently O
, O
but O
we O
know O
- O
said O
the O
American O
President O
- O
Russia B-LOC
is O
an O
important O
country O
, O
we O
can O
cooperate O
significantly O
. O
" O

And O
he O
offered O
Putin B-PER
a O
credit O
certificate O
. O

" O
I O
looked O
this O
man O
in O
the O
eyes O
- O
said O
Bush B-PER
repeating O
how O
Ronald B-PER
Reagan I-PER
said O
of O
Mikhail B-PER
Gorbachev I-PER
- O
it O
is O
worth O
believing O
him O
, O
we O
gave O
him O
our O
trust O
. O
" O

Bush B-PER
has O
guaranteed O
the O
US B-LOC
's O
economic O
commitment O
to O
Russia B-LOC
by O
ensuring O
the O
next O
arrival O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
of O
delegations O
of O
businessmen O
. O

He O
then O
reiterated O
the O
need O
for O
an O
enlargement O
of O
NATO B-ORG
. O

" O
It O
will O
be O
wise O
, O
" O
said O
the O
American O
President O
, O
" O
Russia B-LOC
will O
have O
friends O
at O
its O
borders O
. O
" O

Putin B-PER
first O
recalled O
a O
secret O
document O
from O
1954 O
that O
excluded O
any O
possible O
collaboration O
and O
then O
returned O
to O
a O
very O
different O
present O
. O

" O
NATO B-ORG
is O
not O
an O
enemy O
of O
Russia B-LOC
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
but O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
determine O
whether O
it O
is O
a O
military O
body O
or O
not O
. O
" O

From O
the O
castle O
that O
was O
Tito B-PER
's O
residence O
began O
yesterday O
a O
new O
phase O
of O
Russian O
- O
American O
relations O
with O
reciprocal O
invitations O
that O
both O
accepted O
and O
a O
goodbye O
at O
the O
G8 O
summit O
on O
July O
20 O
in O
Genoa B-LOC
. O

And O
the O
small O
Slovenia B-LOC
seems O
to O
have O
deserved O
the O
gift O
for O
the O
ten O
years O
of O
its O
independence O
that O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
Russia B-LOC
wanted O
to O
make O
them O

The O

able O
to O

Unlike O

the O

a O

of O

Maroni B-PER
has O
excluded O
that O
the O
Government O
as O
such O
is O
working O
or O
will O
work O

arguing O
that O
it O

those O
that O
are O
there O

by O

In O
particular O
, O
the O

In O
the O
coming O

said O
the O

We O

be O

we O
will O

Meanwhile O
on O
the O

" O

The O

agrees O
with O
me O
that O
this O

the O
text O

that O
it O
is O
harmful O
for O
us O

giving O
the O
impression O
that O
the O

Alemanno B-PER

the O

that O

back O

beat O
on O
the O
themes O
close O
to O
the O
family O
and O
in O
particular O
focuses O
on O
the O
house O
: O

I O
believe O
it O
is O
good O
to O
make O
the O
rent O
received O
at O
a O
lower O
fixed O
rate O
than O
the O
average O
rate O
applied O
and O
I O
think O
that O
a O
deduction O
for O
the O
rent O
can O
be O
applied O
in O
the O
tax O
return O
. O

The O
Professor O
thinks O
of O
the O
young O
people O
and O
couples O
who O
are O
facing O
figures O
that O
will O
never O
be O
able O
to O
pay O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
I O
sink O
it O
into O
ICI O
: O

I O
believe O
that O
it O
can O
be O
lowered O
along O
with O
a O
revision O
of O
the O
cadastral O
extimes O
. O

We O
have O
unbelievable O
cadastral O
extimes O
and O
if O
we O
do O
a O
serious O
analysis O
it O
will O
result O
in O
a O
significant O
lowering O
of O
ICI O

, O
works O
wonderfully O
and O
, O
as O
planned O
, O
focuses O
on O
content O
without O
chasing O
Berlusconi B-PER
. O

A O
strategy O
that O
Massimo B-PER
D'Alema I-PER
shows O
to O
share O
in O
full O
: O

The O
Prime O
Minister O
makes O
intimidating O
use O
of O
polls O
in O
the O
election O
campaign O
- O
denounces O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
- O
and O
is O
a O
primitive O
form O
that O
aims O
to O
mobilize O
his O
electorate O
and O
discourage O
the O
center O
- O
left O
. O

This O
illusionist O
managed O
to O
dominate O
the O
scene O
and O
I O
say O
to O
ourselves O
, O
as O
to O
the O
world O
of O
information O
, O
that O
it O
is O
time O
to O
wake O
up O
and O
stop O
dancing O
the O
music O
that O
Berlusconi B-PER
plays O
every O
morning O
. O

The O
Union B-ORG
has O
a O
very O
low O
profile O
on O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
' O
s O
polls O
and O
Prodi B-PER
himself O
merely O
says O
that O
in O
this O
election O
campaign O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
talk O
about O
content O
and O
not O
more O
or O
less O
manipulated O
opinions O
polls O
. O

And O
the O
Professor O
would O
like O
to O
talk O
on O
TV O
with O
his O
opponents O
. O

He O
reiterates O
that O
he O
wants O
to O
challenge O
the O
premier O
along O
with O
Fini B-PER
and O
Casini B-PER
: O

At O
the O
debate O
I O
want O
all O
those O
responsible O
for O
the O
disaster O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
Berlusconi B-PER
to O
say O

" O

not O

this O

Word O
of O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Council O
Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
, O
on O
the O
Iraqi O
crisis O
, O
and O
the O
position O
of O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
in O
this O
regard O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meeting O
held O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
with O
Russian O
President O
Vladimir B-PER
Putin I-PER
. O

The O
fall O
of O
a O
regime O
, O
observed O
Berlusconi B-PER
, O
may O
be O
a O
consequence O
but O
not O
the O
aim O
of O
an O
action O
that O
remains O
under O
international O
law O
. O

In O
the O
face O
of O
the O
position O
taken O
by O
Moscow B-LOC
- O
but O
also O
by O
Paris B-LOC
and O
Beijing B-LOC
- O
in O
the O
debate O
on O
Iraq B-LOC
in O
the O
UN B-ORG
we O
must O
be O
realistic O
and O
recognize O
that O
today O
there O
is O
no O
solution O
other O
than O
that O
of O
a O
dual O
resolution O
. O

Thus O
, O
President O
Berlusconi B-PER
, O
noted O
, O
after O
talks O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
with O
Russian O
President O
Vladimir B-PER
Putin I-PER
and O
Foreign O
Minister O
Igor B-PER
Ivanov I-PER
, O
that O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
a O
single O
resolution O
on O
the O
mission O
of O
UN B-ORG
inspectors O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
which O
also O
provides O
for O
the O
possible O
use O
of O
force O
- O
advocated O
so O
far O
by O
Italy B-LOC
- O
does O
not O
have O
the O
possibility O
of O
being O
approved O
by O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations O
Security O
Council O
. O

Mr O
Berlusconi B-PER
also O
expressed O
his O
personal O
opinion O
on O
not O
believing O
that O
, O
to O
date O
, O
Iraq B-LOC
has O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
not O
because O
there O
could O
be O
no O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
, O
but O
because O
now O
there O
has O
been O
time O
for O
their O
elimination O
or O
different O
allocation O
. O

Berlusconi B-PER
, O
added O
in O
the O
evening O
that O
he O
reported O
what O
is O
also O
Putin B-PER
's O
conviction O
. O

The O
Italian O
premier O
on O
his O
third O
official O
visit O
to O
Russia B-LOC
since O
he O
was O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
current O
government O
, O
was O
received O
by O
Putin B-PER
at O
the O
Kremlin O
, O
where O
he O
stayed O
for O
a O
working O
breakfast O
. O

I O
continue O
to O
believe O
that O
in O
practice O
- O
said O
Berlusconi B-PER
in O
a O
meeting O
with O
the O
Italian O
press O
- O
a O
resolution O
would O
have O
been O
more O
appropriate O
than O
in O
the O
event O
of O
verification O
of O
non O
- O
compliance O
with O
UN B-ORG
decisions O
by O
Iraqis O
would O
have O
provided O
for O
immediate O
armed O
action O
in O
order O
to O
disarm O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

But O
things O
have O
gone O
in O
a O
different O
direction O
. O

By O
Putin B-PER
Berlusconi B-PER
, O
however O
, O
he O
obtained O
a O
renewed O
" O
yes O
" O
to O
the O
adoption O
of O
a O
" O
strong O
" O
UN B-ORG
Resolution O
on O
the O
mission O
of O
UN B-ORG
inspectors O
, O
which O
, O
the O
Russian O
President O
observed O
, O
must O
be O
brought O
to O
Iraq B-LOC
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
order O
to O
remove O
all O
the O
concerns O
of O
the O
international O
community O
. O

" O
Russia B-LOC
has O
been O
convinced O
by O
British O
Prime O
Minister O
Tony B-PER
Blair I-PER
and O
by O
my O
insistence O
- O
said O
Berlusconi B-PER
- O
not O
to O
oppose O
a O
strong O
resolution O
concerning O
the O
visit O
of O
inspectors O
and O
the O
possibility O
to O
investigate O
to O
the O
full O
, O
without O
conditioning O
and O
without O
limitation O
, O
even O
in O
presidential O
buildings O
, O
the O
existence O
or O
not O
of O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
" O
. O

If O
the O
inspections O
were O
to O
detect O
Iraqi O
failures O
, O
for O
the O
premier O
, O
it O
would O
be O
easy O
to O
resort O
to O
a O
new O
UN B-ORG
resolution O
that O
would O
give O
space O
to O
armed O
intervention O
. O

We O
are O
convinced O
that O
the O
Iraqi O
situation O
is O
preoccupying O
for O
all O
, O
he O
then O
found O
Berlusconi B-PER
replying O
to O
those O
who O
asked O
him O
for O
clarification O
on O
the O
new O
position O
taken O
by O
Italy B-LOC
, O
but O
" O
we O
are O
pragmatic O
" O
. O

The O
Italian O
one O
explained O
yesterday O
is O
a O
position O
of O
concreteness O
that O
neither O
side O
of O
us O
nor O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
it O
. O

The O
premier O
then O
reiterated O
that O
he O
felt O
in O
tune O
with O
Blair B-PER
and O
Bush B-PER
, O
but O
also O
that O
" O
you O
have O
to O
be O
realistic O
" O
. O

Adding O
that O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
has O
no O
interest O
in O
acting O
alone O
without O
the O
UN B-ORG
umbrella O
; O

I O
think O
they O
will O
take O
into O
account O
the O
international O
situation O
- O
he O
said O
again O
- O
and O
the O
positions O
in O
the O

In O
this O
way O
it O

Carmen B-PER

The O
singer B-PER
of O

Carmen B-PER
Consoli I-PER
about O
love O
: O

I O
like O
to O
sing O
true O
love O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
romantic O
vision O
, O
dying O
for O
love O
, O
I O
like O
it O
very O
much O
. O

In O
my O
songs O
there O
is O
an O
attempt O
to O
abandon O
passion O
and O
an O
attempt O
to O
become O
self O
- O
sufficient O
and O
not O
make O
a O
person O
a O
point O
of O
reference O
. O

About O
the O
concerts O
: O

The O
concert O
is O
for O
me O
what O
comes O
to O
me O
and O
that O
I O
reflect O
. O

It O
's O
the O
breath O
of O
the O
people O
, O
the O
beating O
hands O
, O
the O
singing O
out O
of O
tune O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
see O
a O
concert O
without O
people O
, O
as O
I O
usually O
feel O
bad O
in O
a O
recording O
room O
because O
people O
are O
missing O
. O

For O
me O
, O
singing O
makes O
sense O
if O
there O
are O
people O
. O

About O
the O
inspiration O
: O

Associo O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
musician O
to O
that O
of O
the O
photographer O
. O

The O
songs O
and O
photos O
represent O
moments O
. O

The O
first O
time O
of O
the O
Consoli B-PER
on O
the O
big O
screen O
brings O
the O
title O
of O
one O
of O
its O
greatest O
successes O
" O
The O
last O
kiss O
" O
. O

In O
the O
film O
by O
Gabriele B-PER
Muccino I-PER
Carmen B-PER
Consoli I-PER
she O
is O
loved O
( O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
) O
and O
quit O
. O

Carmen B-PER
's O
dream O
( O
linked O
to O
the O
world O
of O
cinema O
) O
has O
always O
been O
to O
interpret O
Gilda B-PER
as O
Rita B-PER
Hayworth I-PER
. O

Why O
is O
Carmen B-PER
Consoli I-PER
called O
the O
singer B-PER
? O

It O
all O
happened O
when O
Carmen B-PER
was O
in O
the O
recording O
room O
with O
South O
African O
sound O
engineer O
Allan B-PER
Goldberg I-PER
. O

She O
and O
her O
friend O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
him O
learn O
the O
use O
of O
women O
in O
the O
Italian O
language O
. O

To O
make O
him O
understand O
better O
, O
they O
took O
a O
dog O
named O
Apple O
as O
a O
guinea O
pig O
. O

They O
told O
him O
that O
in O
Italian O
the O
female O
dog O
is O
said O
to O
be O
" O
Canessa O
" O
. O

Allan B-PER
Goldberg I-PER
used O
the O
suffix O
" O
it O
" O
also O
for O
the O
other O
names O
. O

Since O
the O
noun O
" O
singer O
" O
sounded O
bad O
for O
Carmen B-PER
, O
he O
called O
it O
" O
singer O
" O
. O

Hence O
the O
origin O
of O
his O
nickname O
entered O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
many O
thousands O
of O
fans O
. O

Well O
, O
three O

Garcia B-PER
tracks O
them O
all O

makes O
a O
proposal O
that O
you O

not O

: O

Give O
me O
back O
the O
money O
with O

I O
wo O

you O

The O

is O
that O
Ocean B-PER

has O
already O
washed O
up O
almost O
all O
the O

to O
raise O
some O

The O

falls O
on O

a O

from O

: O

the O
blow O

but O
when O

that O
someone O
preceded O
it O

It O
was O
the O
famous O
French O
thief O
Vincent B-PER
Cassel I-PER
who O
will O
launch O
a O
challenge O
that O
could O
save O
Ocean B-PER

If O
they O
manage O

precede O
him O
in O

the O
most O
precious O

of O

, O

what O

been O
known O
, O
is O
quiet O

but O
with O
important O

The O
leaders O
would O

been O
assured O

and O
every O

is O
postponed O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O

Then O
, O
and O
only O
then O
will O
be O
the O
time O
to O

With O
the O
balance O
for O
each O

the O

Then O
he O
started O
working O
again O
in O
the O

. O

Zaccheroni B-PER
is O
doing O
everything O
to O
recover O
some O
of O
the O
injured O
in O

, O
the O
most O
likely O
is O
Cannavaro B-PER

for O

in O

; O

against O
the O
team O
of O
Capello B-PER
Zaccheroni B-PER
has O
all O
the O
intention O
to O
leave O

After O
all O
, O
Inter B-ORG
at O
this O
time O
has O
every O
reason O
to O
prefer O
to O
compete O
with O
the O

above O
all O
to O

The O

TRENTO B-LOC
- O
The O
day O
has O
come O
when O
the O
third O
book O
of O
the O
adventure O
of O
Gigi B-PER
Capuzzo I-PER
in O
gialloblu O
is O
closed O
. O

The O
first O
spoke O
of O
a O
striker O
with O
a O
bright O
career O
, O
better O
when O
he O
was O
young O
, O
who O
then O
( O
as O
Gigetto B-PER
himself O
says O
) O
who O
brought O
to O
Trento B-ORG
played O
from O
real O
point O
of O
the O
penalty O
area O
and O
about O
ten O
networks O
. O

In O
the O
second O
he O
told O
the O
story O
of O
a O
technician O
with O
great O
human O
skills O
, O
ended O
by O
chance O
in O
the O
wrong O
place O
at O
the O
right O
time O
: O

in O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
inevitable O
company O
tossings O
due O
to O
the O
passage O
of O
hand O
between O
the O
old O
management O
and O
the O
current O
involved O
it O
, O
beyond O
any O
demerit O
; O

Gigetto B-PER
paid O
himself O
: O

he O
was O
discharged O
, O
then O
called O
back O
and O
brought O
the O
Trento B-ORG
to O
safety O
; O

situation O
not O
very O
easy O
to O
patch O
up O
, O
when O
you O
leave O
to O
win O
and O
you O
are O
one O
step O
away O
from O
the O
abyss O
of O
a O
humiliating O
retrocession O
in O
the O
regional O
championships O
. O

The O
third O
tome O
closes O
today O
: O

Capuzzo B-PER
did O
what O
he O
was O
asked O
with O
a O
team O
that O
could O
hardly O
have O
given O
more O
: O

the O
11 O
holder O
- O
as O
the O
technician O
has O
always O
admitted O
- O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
best O
ever O
( O
Pavia B-PER
and O
Fanfulla B-PER
) O
. O

but O
woe O
and O
various O
vicissitudes O
have O
often O
tarped O
the O
wings O
to O
the O
eagles O
. O

The O
third O
place O
at O
Pizzighettone B-LOC
today O
( O
in O
case O
of O
victory O
it O
would O
be O
certain O
, O
although O
probably O
in O
cohabitation O
) O
would O
be O
a O
fair O
prize O
( O
and O
recognition O
) O
to O
the O
professionalism O
of O
a O
group O
that O
defeat O
against O
the O
Today B-ORG
risked O
undermining O
to O
the O
foundations O
. O

But O
in O
certain O
situations O
the O
good O
company O
helps O
; O

and O
what O
happened O
, O
at O
other O
levels O
, O
Inter B-ORG
helps O
to O
lighten O
the O
load O
of O
that O
defeat O
. O

Game O
for O
greetings O
, O
and O
for O
a O
ransom O
that O
Capuzzo B-PER
asks O
the O
players O
; O

some O
will O
remain O
( O
if O
it O
is O
already O
written O
) O
, O
others O
will O
pack O
. O

As O
it O
happens O
to O
Gigi B-PER
that O
he O
would O
have O
wanted O
with O
all O
himself O
to O
write O
also O
the O
fourth O
volume O
of O
his O
Gialloblu O
experience O
; O

that O
, O
he O
hoped O
, O
of O
the O
return O
among O
the O
prof O
. O

Instead O
you O
will O
have O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
podium O
; O

he O
will O
try O
to O
set O
foot O
in O
it O
definitely O
having O
to O
scrape O
the O
barrel O
in O
the O
group O
of O
the O
baby O
seen O
the O
defections O
of O
Da B-PER
Re I-PER
, O
Testa B-PER
and O
Zampedri B-PER
; O

space O
perhaps O
for O
De B-PER
Nardi I-PER
and O
Visentin B-PER
, O
between O
the O
Benatelli B-PER
poles O
, O
then O
the O
" O
usual O
" O
. O

You O
look O
for O
a O
victory O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
end O
up O
in O
a O
holiday O
anyway O
; O

but O
the O
Pizzighettone B-ORG
, O
saved O
and O
at O
a O
good O
time O

has O
the O

again O

The O

, O
the O
Sanvitese B-PER

slow O
to O
find O
the O
equal O

from O

however O
, O
here O
is O
the O
net O
of O
the O
Friulian O
victory O
that O
comes O
from O
an O
initiative O
of O
the O
usual O

good O

Some O
doubts O
about O
the O
location O
of O

always O
makes O
good O

several O

At O
33 O
' O
is O
good O
the O
combination O
Baido B-PER

Vianello B-PER
- O
Mariotti B-PER
that O
allows O
the O

finish O

on O

After O
a O
counterfoot O

and O
not O
a O

On O

, O
the O

highlighted O
the O
many O

factors O

the O

of O

The O

at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
moderator O
on O
how O
much O
the O
sport O
had O
taken O
away O
and O
given O
it O
, O
spoke O
of O
a O

life O
highlighting O
the O
satisfaction O
received O
from O
the O
awareness O
of O
having O
achieved O
what O
had O
been O

. O

Stefania B-PER
Belmondo I-PER
instead O
recalled O
the O
difficulties O
encountered O
in O
achieving O
certain O
results O
, O
such O
as O
the O
breaking O
of O
a O
stick O
that O
can O
compromise O
you O
in O
the O
most O
important O
race O
the O
preparation O
work O
of O
years O
. O

The O
former O
cyclist O
Belluti B-PER
then O
illustrated O
his O
role O
as O
representative O
of O
the O

within O
the O
Coni B-ORG
and O
the O
difficulties O
especially O
of O
economic O
type O
that O
this O
organism O
is O
going O
through O
. O

There O
were O
no O
lack O
of O
questions O
about O
the O
unupbuilding O
aspects O
of O
sport O
such O
as O
doping O
: O

the O
champions O
stressed O
that O
these O
aspects O
, O
especially O
at O
the O
level O
of O
information O
agencies O
, O
can O
not O
obscure O
the O
promotion O
and O
results O
of O
sports O
activities O
, O
especially O
those O
less O
promoted O
and O
that O
at O

they O
always O
bring O
the O

You O
ca O

the O
square O
of O
the O
circle O
, O
even O
the O
Dellai B-PER
Durnwalder B-PER

finds O
difficulty O
... O

President O
Andreotti B-PER
, O
does O
that O
make O
you O
happy O
? O

No O
, O
absolutely O
not O
. O

Even O
less O
I O
am O
satisfied O
with O
these O
difficulties O
of O
Dellai B-PER
with O
which O
I O
have O
an O
excellent O
relationship O
. O

But O
it O
is O
when O
the O
newspapers O
are O
blatantly O
disproved O
that O
I O
am O
happy O
. O

We O
were O
considered O
traitors O
because O
we O
postponed O
every O
decision O
, O
but O
from O
the O
stalemate O
of O
the O
negotiations O
we O
understand O
that O
even O
if O
there O
had O
been O
the O
Parliament O
of O
the O
Pact B-ORG
nothing O
would O
have O
been O
done O
... O

But O
the O
distances O
from O
the O
center O
- O
left O
on O
the O
Region B-LOC
have O
decreased O
. O

Yes O
. O

With O
different O
languages O
we O
all O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

In O
substance O
you O
are O
not O
far O
away O
. O

The O
big O
problem O
is O
the O
so O
- O
called O
overthrow O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
foreseen O
by O
the O
Bicameral O
. O

And O
probably O
in O
all O
this O
some O
Dellai B-PER
valuation O
error O
did O
. O

If O
he O
diplomatically O
moved O
in O
a O
different O
way O
, O
on O
December O
18 O
in O
the O
provincial O
council O
he O
became O
president O
. O

And O
also O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
SVP B-ORG
they O
wanted O
to O
anticipate O
the O
times O
. O

I O
say O
it O
with O
extreme O
tranquility O
, O
without O
criticism O
. O

So O
you O
're O
going O
to O
build O
a O
new O
region B-LOC
? O

On O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
delegation O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
we O
realize O
that O
in O
the O
party O
we O
will O
have O
big O
problems O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
will O
not O
be O
the O
antechamber O
of O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
paradox O
: O

the O
Greens B-ORG
want O
you O
to O
chair O
the O
Region B-LOC
, O
the O
Svp B-ORG
no O
... O

The O
SVP B-ORG
has O
never O
really O
pronounced O
itself O
. O

Brugger B-PER
just O
said O
, O
" O
We O
'll O
take O
it O
between O
the O
two O
fighters O
. O
" O

But O
it O
was O
a O
joke O
. O

We O
were O
accused O
of O
being O
the O
silly O
servants O
of O
the O
SVP B-ORG
, O
but O
at O
the O
time O
when O
we O
go O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Region B-LOC
, O
the O
Trentinos O
say O
to O
the O
SVP B-ORG
: O
" O
You O
decide O
. O
" O

This O
is O
not O
the O
behavior O
to O
be O
held O
! O

The O
agreement O
on O
the O
Presidency O
must O
be O
reached O
in O
Trento B-LOC
, O
also O
deciding O
to O
leave O
it O
to O
SVP B-ORG
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
Brugger B-PER
's O
blessing O
, O
because O
then O
yes O
it O
would O
mean O
that O
we O
are O
kneeling O
, O
as O
I O
fear O
someone O
has O
done O
. O

The O
fact O
remains O
that O
the O
support O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
is O
strange O
. O

It O
's O
true O
, O
but O
on O
issues O
like O
guaranteeing O
I O
've O
always O
appreciated O
Boato B-PER
. O

On O
matters O
of O
the O
territory O
we O
agree O
less O
. O

But O
we O
wonder O
why O
the O
SVP B-ORG
wants O
to O
make O
homologists O
and O
then O
does O
not O
want O
them O
to O
come O
to O
Bolzano B-LOC
. O

How O
do O
you O
have O
them O
mostly O
in O
the O
Region B-LOC
and O
not O
in O
Bolzano B-LOC

that O

Closed O
in O
1972 O
the O
happy O
parenthesis O
of O
the O

, O
while O
the O
Tour O

So O
why O
not O
open O
the O
competition O
even O
the O
amateurs O
, O
less O
and O
less O

for O
joke O
, O
more O
and O
more O
real O
athletes O
, O
often O
stronger O
than O
some O

? O

In O
1993 O

in O

certainly O
at O
the O

even O
today O
, O
certainly O
not O
to O

to O

With O
him O
many O

Dear O
Director O
, O
only O
today O
, O
upon O
returning O
from O
a O
business O
trip O
, O
I O
can O
consider O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
tranquility O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
has O
seen O
me O
unnoticed O
protagonist O
in O
your O
newspaper O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
have O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
recognize O
myself O
in O
the O
title O
with O
effect O
Dellai O
eats O
the O
museums O
with O
which O
you O
wanted O
to O
present O
my O
speech O
, O
putting O
a O
name O
at O
the O
head O
of O
an O
article O
in O
which O
, O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
the O
discussion O
on O
the O
level O
of O
ideas O
and O
principles O
, O
I O
had O
very O
well O
taken O
care O
not O
to O
do O
so O
. O

The O
intervention O
itself O
was O
thus O
a O
sort O
of O
" O
stoned O
" O
pre O
- O
electoral O
, O
according O
to O
a O
style O
that O
is O
nevertheless O
completely O
foreign O
to O
the O
intentions O
, O
interests O
and O
manner O
of O
working O
of O
the O
writer O
. O

The O
same O
unnecessary O
emphasis O
can O
be O
found O
in O
the O
six O
- O
column O
recuperation O
of O
the O
following O

( O

which O
leaves O
completely O
grounded O
: O

for O
its O
perentoriousness O
certainly O
worthy O
of O
better O
cause O
and O
for O
the O
haste O
with O
which O
it O
wanted O
to O
close O
a O
civil O
debate O
, O
more O
than O
legitimate O
and O
I O
believe O
also O
useful O
, O
given O
the O
scarce O
and O
indeed O
very O
little O
information O
circulated O
also O
among O
the O
professionals O
on O
this O
particular O
aspect O
of O

To O

and O
to O
all O
those O
who O
may O
have O
misunderstood O

I O
repeat O
that O
I O
have O
never O
written O
or O
claimed O
that O

is O
not O
necessary O
. O

Actually O
. O

What O
we O
do O
not O
understand O
, O
however O
, O
is O
how O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
having O
already O
at O
its O

all O

recent O
years O

and O
in O
a O
totally O
obvious O
way O

increasingly O
renounced O

do O
so O
. O

Rather O
, O
it O
was O
preferred O
to O
postpone O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
museum O
network O
to O
a O
future O

reconfiguration O
of O
the O

, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
grasp O
either O
the O
urgency O
or O
the O
practical O
opportunity O

Your O

How O
much O
violence O

in O

I O
refer O
to O
the O
letter O
of O
Mrs O
Francesca B-PER
Agnoli I-PER
, O
published O
on O
8 O
October O
, O
in O
which O
she O
complains O
of O
the O
danger O
of O
recognition O
of O
homosexual O
couples O
, O
especially O
if O
this O
preludes O
also O
to O
the O
possible O
permission O
to O
adopt O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
remind O
you O
that O
marriage O
, O
beyond O
the O
sacredness O
of O
which O
it O
has O
clothed O
itself O
in O
the O
course O
of O
history O
, O
has O
been O
and O
remained O
essentially O
a O
contract O
. O

Being O
able O
to O
freely O
enter O
into O
a O
contract O
with O
legal O
value O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
right O
of O
all O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
only O
a O
traditional O
family O
is O
an O
environment O
suitable O
for O
healthy O
and O
psychologically O
balanced O
growth O
is O
only O
the O
usual O
stereotype O
. O

I O
invite O
the O
kind O
lady O
to O
read O
the O
reports O
of O
Blue B-ORG
Phone I-ORG
, O
the O
data O
on O
domestic O
violence O
or O
even O
, O
simply O
, O
the O
daily O
chronicles O
, O
which O
record O
, O
with O
impressive O
frequency O
, O
massacres O
within O
seemingly O
healthy O
and O
balanced O
families O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
sound O
offensive O
to O
me O
the O
statements O
of O
the O
kind O
lady O
towards O
all O
parents O
both O
adoptive O
, O
and O
become O
such O
with O
the O
help O
of O
medicine O
, O
" O
considered O
free O
to O
order O
the O
children O
in O
test O
tube O
, O
as O
it O
is O
done O
with O
a O
pet O
dog O
, O
and O
then O
raise O
a O
child O
not O
them O
, O
who O
does O
not O
recognize O
in O
them O
a O
common O
genetic O
heritage O
... O
" O

The O
lady O
then O
scandalizes O
the O
idea O
that O
it O
is O
permissible O
for O
women O
, O
with O
an O
affixed O
self O
- O
insemination O
kit O
and O
a O
syringe O
containing O
sperm O
, O
distributed O
by O
the O
Arcilesbica B-ORG
, O
to O
have O
children O
alone O
, O
in O
their O
home O
. O

Actually O
, O
women O
have O
had O
their O
own O
children O
for O
centuries O
. O

Until O
recently O
a O
hypocritical O
moral O
has O
stigmatized O
them O
. O

Well O
that O
went O
were O
called O
girls O
- O
mothers O
, O
more O
often O
with O
infamous O
epithets O
. O

The O
novelty O
that O
the O
kind O
lady O
condemns O
, O
is O
the O
idea O
that O
women O
can O
deliberately O
choose O
to O
have O
a O
child O
on O
their O
own O
. O

But O
this O
is O
something O
that O
nature O
, O
whose O
laws O
the O
kind O
lady O
invokes O
, O
allows O
very O
well O
. O

I O
assume O
that O
the O
lady O
, O
writing O
, O
that O
nature O
clearly O
predicts O
that O
man O
is O
born O
in O
a O
certain O
way O
, O
without O
manipulations O
and O
artificial O
forcings O
, O
instead O
intended O
to O
condemn O
all O
surgical O
interventions O
, O
transplants O
, O
artificial O
valves O
, O
transfusions O
, O
perhaps O
even O
medicines O
and O
so O
on O
, O
as O
artificial O
manipulations O
and O
forcings O
that O
contrast O
the O
natural O
course O
of O
things O
. O

The O
members O
of O
Azzurro B-ORG
Donna I-ORG
feel O
called O
to O
a O
reflection O
on O
the O
request O
of O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Muslim O
community O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
for O
the O
introduction O
to O
school O
of O
an O
optional O
hour O
of O
Islamic O
culture O
and O
religion O
held O
by O
Arab O
teachers O
. O

In O
schools O
is O
expected O
the O
hour O
of O
religion O
, O
whose O
attendance O
is O
not O
obligatory O
, O
by O
virtue O
of O
the O
Concordat O
between O
the O
State O
and O
the O
Church O
. O

Italy B-LOC
is O
a O
secular O
state O
, O
but O
all O
Western O
culture O
is O
deeply O
marked O
by O
the O
common O
Christian O
matrix O
. O

For O
obvious O
historical O
reasons O
it O
is O
not O
conceivable O
to O
put O
the O
teaching O
of O
the O
Koran O
on O
the O
same O
level O
. O

Without O
bringing O
ecumenism O
into O
play O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
Trentino O
society O
has O
already O
shown O
acceptance O
, O
respect O
, O
openness O
to O
dialogue O
not O
to O
be O
feared O
accusations O
of O
closure O
due O
to O
the O
perplexities O
aroused O
by O
the O
request O
of O
Imam O
Breigheche B-PER
. O

And O
we O
do O
not O
like O
that O
the O
non O
- O
reciprocal O
treatment O
of O
Christian O
communities O
in O
Islamic O
countries O
is O
simply O
put O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
barter O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
much O
more O
complex O
. O

It O
is O
also O
a O
coercion O
to O
interpret O
this O
request O
of O
the O
Islamic O
community O
as O
a O
sign O
of O
openness O
or O
will O
for O
integration O
into O
the O
society O
that O
welcomes O
it O
. O

Imam O
Breighe B-PER
is O
simply O
fulfilling O
his O
task O
, O
which O
is O
to O
conquer O
more O
and O
more O
space O
for O
his O
community O
. O

Full O
religious O
and O
religious O
freedom O
is O
out O
of O
the O
question O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
right O
to O
witness O
and O
pass O
on O
one O
's O
faith O
to O
one O
's O
children O
, O
but O
doing O
so O
in O
schools O
is O
another O
issue O
. O

Especially O
because O
we O
know O
that O
for O
Islam O
the O
religious O
authority O
is O
often O
one O
with O
the O
political O
and O
civil O
one O
, O
unlike O
Christianity O
. O

That O
is O
the O
crux O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

The O
Koran O
is O
the O
sacred O
book O
of O
Islam O
, O
as O
such O
deserves O
respect O
and O
regard O
. O

But O
we O
also O
know O
that O
there O
are O
several O
possibilities O
for O
interpretation O
of O
this O
text O
. O

Without O
shaking O
the O
fear O
of O
the O
most O
fundamentalist O
who O
exalt O
the O
sacrifice O
of O
the O
suicide O
bombers O
to O
kill O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
holy O
war O
, O
it O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
survive O
in O
Islamic O
countries O
sad O
realities O
and O
unacceptable O
for O
us O
such O
as O
stonings O
, O
infibulation O
, O
segregation O
and O
discrimination O
of O
women O
. O

We O
can O
not O
ignore O
the O
profound O
conflict O
within O
Islam O
between O
the O
most O
fundamentalist O
and O
moderate O
souls O
, O
but O
we O
can O
not O
think O
of O
intervening O
or O
imposing O
the O
ways O
of O
teaching O
and O
interpretation O
of O
the O
Koran O
. O

We O
bear O
witness O
to O
our O
values O
of O
freedom O
, O
respect O
for O
the O
person O
, O
tolerance O
and O
equality O
, O
we O
have O
left O
behind O
the O
crusades O
and O
the O
Inquisition O
for O
centuries O
. O

The O
Islamic O
communities O
that O
are O
welcomed O
into O
our O
society O
can O
find O
in O
the O
Western O
world O
a O
valuable O
opportunity O
to O
get O
away O
from O
fundamentalism O
and O
fundamentalism O
if O
they O
wish O
. O

But O
how O
to O
live O
one O
's O
faith O
remains O
a O
question O
that O
the O
Islamic O
world O
has O
to O
face O
within O
itself O
, O
first O
, O
and O
then O
dialogue O
and O
confront O
each O
other O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
if O
it O
is O
willing O
to O
do O
so O
, O
with O
other O
faiths O
, O
with O
the O
Catholic O
world O
. O

But O
under O
no O
circumstances O
and O
under O
no O
circumstances O
at O
this O
time O
can O
this O
responsibility O
be O
placed O
on O
our O
school O
system O
, O
which O
can O
not O
and O
must O
not O
become O
the O
interlocutor O
, O
neither O
the O
field O
nor O
the O
means O
to O
handle O
this O
very O
delicate O
issue O

Easter O

Family O
Distress O

Dear O
Director O
, O
I O
am O
a O
parent O
of O
a O
girl O
enrolled O
in O
the O
first O
grade O
and O
a O
child O
attending O
the O
first O
grade O
. O

In O
these O
days O
our O
children O
have O
returned O
" O
almost O
all O
" O
to O
School O
after O
the O
Easter O
holidays O
. O

I O
write O
" O
almost O
everyone O
" O
because O
this O
year O
too O
, O
and O
perhaps O
in O
particular O
this O
year O
, O
the O
Easter O
holiday O
calendar O
has O
provoked O
in O
the O
Trentine O
families O
a O
real O
disgust O
. O

I O
consider O
myself O
one O
of O
the O
lucky O
because O
the O
" O
holidays O
" O
of O
my O
two O
daughters O
were O
distributed O
over O
the O
same O
period O
. O

But O
unfortunately O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
for O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
families O
in O
Trentino O
who O
, O
having O
two O
or O
more O
children O
enrolled O
in O
different O
schools O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
, O
had O
to O
get O
horny O
at O
the O
least O
worst O
doing O
at O
times O
also O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
mortal O
jumps O
" O
, O
asking O
for O
holidays O
and O
permissions O
to O
their O
employers O
finding O
themselves O
forced O
to O
have O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
holiday O
periods O
that O
they O
would O
have O
enjoyed O
during O
the O
summer O
. O

This O
year O
the O
school O
schedule O
provides O
for O
the O
end O
of O
the O
lessons O
in O
the O
first O
days O
of O
June O
and O
the O
return O
in O
the O
second O
week O
of O
September O
. O

This O
long O
period O
forces O
the O
Families O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
follow O
their O
children O
properly O
, O
to O
break O
holidays O
and O
permits O

to O
rely O
on O

, O
relatives O
, O
babysitters O
, O
post O

and O
anything O
else O
. O

In O
particular O
I O
address O
the O
Councillor O
for O
Education O
Tiziano B-PER
Salvaterra I-PER
and O
his O
collaborators O
, O
as O
well O
as O
all O
political O

social O
and O
trade O
union O
forces O
who O
are O
sensitive O
to O
this O
topic O
, O
so O
that O
we O
find O
a O
way O
through O
which O
we O
can O
build O
a O
unique O
school O
calendar O
for O
all O
schools O
of O
order O

grade O
of O
the O
Autonomous B-LOC
Province I-LOC
of I-LOC
Trento I-LOC
in O
order O
to O

both O

To O
the O

I O
appeal O
also O
to O
them O
to O
take O
action O
, O
exerting O
the O
necessary O
pressures O

in O

much O
I O
think O
that O
the O
break O

up O
of O

not O

blood O

After O
reading O
in O
the O
newspapers O
and O
listening O
on O
television O
to O
countless O
debates O
about O
the O
movie O
" O
The O
Passion O
, O
" O
I O
chose O
to O
go O
see O
it O
. O

When O
I O
left O
the O
cinema O
, O
there O
was O
in O
me O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
a O
great O
desire O
to O
cry O
, O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O
dismay O
for O
the O
many O
words O
spent O
about O
the O
violence O
that O
spread O
in O
the O
film O
. O

Words O
of O
indignation O
, O
words O
crying O
out O
to O
scandal O
, O
words O
that O
invite O
and O
induce O
not O
to O
attend O
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
violence O
is O
present O
in O
a O
significant O
way O
in O
the O
film O
, O
but O
it O
risks O
stopping O
only O
those O
who O
look O
without O
faith O
. O

The O
scenes O
of O
pain O
find O
meaning O
and O
hope O
in O
the O
constant O
presence O
of O
Mary B-PER
, O
who O
first O
recognizes O
, O
accepts O
and O
sustains O
what O
Jesus B-PER
lives O
in O
His O
Passion O
. O

The O
suffering O
of O
the O
Mother O
is O
immense O
, O
but O
somehow O
manages O
not O
to O
make O
the O
viewer O
lose O
the O
connection O
with O
Love O
and O
Heaven O
. O

Beautiful O
also O
the O
figure O
of O
the O
Cyrenean O
who O
, O
helping O
Jesus B-PER
to O
carry O
the O
Cross O
and O
almost O
embracing O
it O
under O
the O
weight O
that O
he O
shares O
with O
him O
, O
seems O
to O
give O
voice O
to O
a O
humanity O
that O
also O
knows O
how O
to O
love O
and O
correspond O
to O
the O
Project O
of O
God B-PER
. O

The O
various O
flashbacks O
that O
interrupt O
the O
scenes O
of O
the O
Passion O
, O
moreover O
, O
recall O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
mission O
and O
message O
of O
Jesus B-PER
, O
ending O
then O
to O
flow O
and O
incarnate O
in O
that O
pain O
that O
remains O
yes O
in O
the O
foreground O
, O
but O
that O
becomes O
, O
in O
the O
film O
as O
in O
the O

among O

it O

, O
could O
not O

that O

I O
would O
like O
to O
ask O
two O
questions O
to O
the O
supporters O
of O
the O
3B O
( O
Bush B-PER
Blair B-PER
Berlusconi B-PER
): O

First O
question O
: O

If O
the O
coalition O
of O
the O
willing O
were O
really O
willing O
to O
bring O
democracy O
to O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
how O

the O
Iraqis O
elect O
the O
Italian O
Barbara B-PER
Contini I-PER
as O
Governor O
of O
Nassirya B-LOC
? O

3B O
did O
n't O
let O
us O
know O
: O

1 O
. O

the O
foundations O
of O
his O
electoral O
campaign O

2 O
. O

in O
which O
language O
the O
Lady O
has O
made O
it O

3 O
. O

where O
, O
how O
and O
when O
he O
informed O
the O
Iraqis O
of O
his O
programs O

4 O
. O

How O
did O
the O
Iraqis O
vote O
on O
it O
, O

Since O
they O
're O
not O
even O
able O
to O
get O
out O
of O
their O
homes O

a. O

to O
buy O
bread O
. O

b. O

to O
go O
to O
school O
. O

c. O

to O
go O
to O
work O
, O

Since O
there O
is O
no O
work O
, O
apart O
from O
that O
of O
torturers O
( O
venture O
soldiers O
) O
paid O
figures O
from O
dizziness O
to O
defend O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
coalitions O
. O

Second O
question O
: O

The O
avalanches O
of O
money O
paid O
to O
mercenaries O
are O
those O
of O
oil O
stolen O
from O
coalitions O
to O
Iraqis O
( O
who O
kill O
them O
for O
revenge O
) O
or O
are O

Thus O
dies O
an O
Italian O
" O
headlines O
virtually O
the O
majority O
of O
Italian O
newspapers O
. O

The O
obvious O
intention O
is O
to O
make O
him O
a O
hero O
. O

The O
heroes O
should O
not O
apologize O
for O
the O
situation O
in O
which O
they O
found O
themselves O
, O
for O
the O
end O
they O
did O

You O
should O
not O
apologize O
to O
their O
family O
either O
. O

But O
the O
title O
lends O
itself O
also O
another O
meaning O
, O
more O
realistic O
: O

This O
is O
how O
it O
happens O
to O
die O
to O
an O
Italian O
. O

A O
guy O
like O
so O
many O
who O
thought O
he O
signed O
a O
gold O
contract O
. O

A O
couple O
of O
months O
and O
I O
solved O
the O
problem O
. O

I O
can O
get O
married O
, O
put O
up O
a O
house O

What O
do O
you O
want O
to O
happen O
? O

Signed O
through O
someone O
who O
had O
his O
commission O
on O
the O
contract O

from O
a O
company O
based O
in O

who O
knows O
where O

even O
the O
one O
with O
his O
good O
commission O

to O
protect O
someone O
who O
" O
work O
" O
in O
Iraq O
earning O
ten O
or O
a O
hundred O
times O
as O
much O

Despite O
the O
high O
costs O
it O
has O
to O
bear O
to O
ensure O
its O
own O
security O
. O

" O
Sold O
lives O
" O
was O
the O
title O
of O
a O
50 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
film O
. O

This O
would O
be O
the O
right O
title O
for O
this O
story O
. O

He O
knew O
about O
the O
risk O
, O
he O
chose O
him O

freely O

Freely O

Would O
he O
have O
accepted O
if O
he O
had O
a O

? O

No O
, O
killing O
a O
hostage O
is O
infamous O
, O
as O
well O
as O
stupid O
politically O

But O
just O
as O
infamous O
is O
creating O
the O
conditions O
for O
people O
who O
are O
not O
" O
excited O
" O
at O
all O
to O
accept O
putting O
their O
lives O
at O

in O
that O
way O

Worse O
still O
to O

on O
who O
is O

Until O

it O
had O

more O

than O
the O
" O

not O
the O
last O
ones O
of O
the O

signed O
by O
the O

On O
Sunday O
, O
however O
, O
the O
provincial O

member O
gathered O
at O
his O
house O
the O
autonomous O

, O
Genziane B-ORG

to O
understand O
us O
that O
they O
will O
run O
to O
the O
next O
electoral O
appointment O
with O
a O
list O
of O
their O
own O
under O
the O
initials O
" O
United O
Autonomists O
for O
Riva O
" O
. O

And O
on O
the O
name O
of O
Pietro B-PER
Matteotti I-PER
has O
cashed O
a O
" O
yes O
" O
decided O
, O
moreover O
already O
unofficially O
expressed O
on O
other O
occasions O
by O
numerous O
representatives O
of O
the O
autumnist O
world O
. O

Molinari B-PER
makes O
the O
count O
and O
tonight O
will O
bring O
the O
results O
to O
the O
perhaps O
decisive O
meeting O
of O
the O
Margaret B-ORG
. O

The O
appointment O
is O
crucial O
, O
or O
at O
least O
should O
be O
. O

You O
have O
to O
decide O
whether O
to O
continue O
to O
support O
Matteotti B-PER
or O
prefer O
the O
coalition O
and O
split O
the O
civic O
. O

The O
first O
hypothesis O
, O
in O
the O
current O
state O
of O
things O
, O
seems O
the O
most O
plausible O
, O
the O
least O
painful O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
we O
should O
also O
know O
what O
Riva B-ORG
decided O
tomorrow O
that O
was O
bringing O
together O
her O
board O
of O
directors O
last O
night O
for O
a O
definitive O
clarification O
. O

Yesterday O
the O
voices O
were O
those O
of O
a O
substantial O
increase O
in O
the O
possibilities O
that O
RD B-ORG
runs O
alone O
with O
Enzo B-PER
Bassetti I-PER
candidate O
mayor O
but O
certainly O
not O
to O
count O
and O
think O
of O
agreements O
for O
the O
second O
round O
. O

If O
Matteotti B-PER
does O
n't O
fit O
us O
right O
now O
, O
it O
wo O
n't O
fit O
us O
even O
in O

Agreed O
, O
that O
' O
Igor B-PER
Marini I-PER
who O
accuses O
her O
of O
having O
cashed O
a O
super O
- O
maxi O
- O
mega O
bribe O
, O
has O
the O
air O
of O
one O
who O
shoots O
her O
big O
by O
profession O
, O
but O
before O
shouting O
at O
the O
subversive O
plot O
of O
the O
right O
of O
government O
, O
you O
have O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
superteste O
, O
and O
check O
one O
by O
one O
his O
shots O
. O

Otherwise O
it O
is O
a O
process O
to O
the O
intentions O
, O
and O
the O
triumph O
of O
the O
retrology O
: O

exactly O
what O
the O
olive O
trees O
( O
rightly O
) O
blame O
the O
Berlusconists O
. O

Then O
I O
confess O
that O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
Kessler B-PER
and O
his O
central O
- O
left O
colleagues O
who O
desert O
the O
hearing O
of O
Igor B-PER
( O
who O
already O
caused O

. O

Thus O
they O
accredit O
the O
idea O
that O
for O
the O
Olive B-ORG

, O

It O
is O
humiliating O
to O
read O
more O

the O
one O

Sunday O

the B-ORG

invited O

a O
letter O

Assuming O

that O
of O

an O
irresolvable O

those O
that O

perhaps O
to O
the O

who O

not O
clear O
what O
the O

what O
function O
they O
have O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
work O
that O
is O
assigned O
at O

is O
neither O
a O
punishment O
nor O
a O
sadistic O
pleasure O
of O
the O
teachers O
( O
since O
then O
they O
have O
to O
correct O
what O
the O
pupils O
do O
) O
, O
but O
a O
way O
to O
deepen O
and O
internalize O
the O
knowledge O
provided O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
in O
the O
short O
time O
available O
at O
school O
, O
to O
which O
is O
delegated O
not O
only O
the O
education O

also O
the O
education O
of O
the O
children O
( O
once O
the O
family O
's O
task O

In O
any O
activity O
it O
is O
only O
with O
constant O
commitment O
and O
exercise O
that O
good O
results O
are O
achieved O
. O

Nobody O
is O
surprised O
if O
the O
sportsman O
, O
for O
example O
, O
is O
asked O
for O
hours O
and O
hours O
of O
daily O
training O

In O
addition O
, O
tasks O
also O
serve O
to O
empower O
young O
people O
in O
hiring O
and O
completing O
a O
commitment O
. O

There O
is O
a O
legitimate O
suspicion O
that O
all O
these O
criticisms O
are O
due O
to O
the O
less O
and O
less O
time O
the O
parents O
are O
willing O
to O
devote O
to O
the O
training O
of O
their O
children O
, O
following O
them O
and O
helping O
them O
in O
the O
study O
, O
and O
to O
the O
low O
consideration O
that O
many O
give O
to O
the O
school O
and O
to O
the O
work O
of O
the O
teachers O
, O
preferring O
the O
TV O
and O
the O
computer O
as O
their O
comfortable O
substitutes O
. O

Often O
families O
do O
not O
even O
find O
five O
minutes O
to O
justify O
in O
writing O
, O
as O
good O
education O
would O
require O
, O
failure O
to O
carry O
out O
tasks O
. O

Considering O
that O
there O
are O
many O
teachers O
who O
passionately O
devote O
themselves O
to O
a O
job O
that O
has O
become O
increasingly O
difficult O

it O
would O

that O

it O

a O

I O
have O
a O
doubt O

It O
is O
not O
that O
this O
increase O

what O
a O

also O

receive O
150 O
million O

over O
a O

I O
think O
so O
because O
since O

there O
is O
no O

a O
2 O

80,392.00 O

This O
means O
that O

150 O

The O

have O
further O
comforted O
the O

that O
led O
me O

criticism O

I O
am O
convinced O
that O
in O
order O
to O
promote O
a O
serious O
culture O
of O
peace O
, O
which O
is O
however O
linked O
to O
a O
firm O
protection O
of O

, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
manipulation O
of O
the O
reality O
that O
the O
Left O
have O
organized O
art O
. O

They O
have O
also O
tried O
, O
in O
a O
recent O
television O
broadcast O
, O
to O
deny O
the O
membership O
of O
the O
flags O
to O
fundamentalist O
pacifism O
and O
" O
no O
global O
" O
, O
claiming O
a O
supposed O
transversality O
of O
the O
flags O
. O

that O
this O
constitutes O
a O
clear O
deception O
for O
citizens O
in O
good O
faith O
, O
however O
, O
this O
is O
demonstrated O
by O
the O
recent O
political O
convention O
of O
the O
duo O
" O
Poplar O
- O
Communist O
" O
Cofferati B-PER
Moretti B-PER
, O
where O
the O
rainbow O

triumphed O
everywhere O
as O
a O
symbol O
of O
a O
well O
- O
determined O
and O
identifiable O
political O
movement O
. O

Other O
than O
transversal O
reference O
to O
values O
, O
this O
is O
a O
shameful O
instrumental O
appropriation O
of O
a O
universal O
value O
, O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
Italian O
Left O
; O

a O
true O
affront O
to O
those O
who O
have O
different O
political O
ideas O
but O
also O
to O
those O
citizens O
, O
even O
of O
the O
left O
, O
who O
in O
good O
faith O
have O
exposed O
the O
flags O
, O
become O
of O
discord O
. O

I O
am O
talking O
about O
manipulation O
of O
reality O
also O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
attempt O
to O
represent O
a O
Trentino B-LOC
rainbow O
just O
because O
7000 O
or O
10,000 O
flags O
would O
be O
sold O
to O
a O
population O
of O
about O
four O
hundred O
thousand O
inhabitants O
. O

Leaving O
aside O
that O
the O
data O
is O
biased O
and O
therefore O
not O
easily O
verifiable O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
remind O
readers O
that O
it O
is O
enough O
a O
objective O
look O
at O
our O
homes O
to O
resize O
a O
fake O
miracle O
in O
Trentino O
. O

One O
can O
indeed O
be O
pleased O
that O
having O
stimulated O
an O
ad O
hoc O
reflection O
has O
caused O
some O
useless O
flag O
to O
fall O
back O
, O
but O
above O
all O
has O
increased O
the O
deeper O
meaning O
of O
the O
Peace O
value O
, O
distracting O
it O
from O
a O
serious O
instrumental O
use O
for O
political O
purposes O
. O

I O
therefore O
call O
on O
the O
Left O
to O
be O
more O
loyal O
and O
more O
tolerant O
to O
those O
who O
allow O
themselves O
to O
criticize O
and O
expose O
their O
actions O
. O

The O
Right O
has O
revealed O
, O
motivatedly O
, O
the O
true O
hidden O
meaning O
of O
such O
flags O
, O
but O
has O
always O
done O
so O
in O
a O
respectful O
and O
constructive O
manner O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
pacifists O
have O
shown O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
letters O
sent O
to O
the O
Adige B-ORG
, O
how O
much O
resentment O
and O
intolerance O
nourish O
for O
the O
non O

aligned O
, O
defined O
fascists O
only O
because O
they O
had O
the O
courage O
not O
to O
bend O
their O
heads O
in O
front O
of O
an O
obvious O
, O
instrumental O
and O
misleading O
mystification O
of O
reality O
. O

To O
put O
it O
to O
Gustavo B-PER
Selva I-PER
, O
these O
pacifists O
" O
take O
to O
the O
streets O
, O
in O

permanent O

They O
are O
the O

who O
in O

have O
remained O
at O

What O
if O

to O
the O

and O
they O
have O
to O
come O
up O
for O
the O
question O

Marino B-PER
can O
still O

However O
it O

. O

Patrick B-PER
Lorenzi I-PER
( O
Margherita B-ORG
) O
for O
urban O
planning O
, O
Giovanni B-PER
Santoni I-PER
( O
Italian B-ORG
Communists I-ORG
) O
for O
social O
activities O
, O
Carlo B-PER
Daves I-PER
( O
Ds B-ORG
, O
at O
the O
time O
he O
replaced O
Adalberto B-PER
Mosaner I-PER
) O
for O
the O
commission O
on O
the O
revision O
of O
the O
municipal O
statute O
and O
the O
council O
court O
regulations O
. O

The O
first O
consideration O
that O
comes O
naturally O
is O
that O
the O
appeal O
lacks O
the O
commission O
on O
the O
companies O
participated O
, O
wanted O
by O
the O
council B-ORG
during O
the O
legislature O
of O
Cesare B-PER
Malossini I-PER
and O
confirmed O
by O
the O
executive O
Matteotti O
. O

The O
municipal B-ORG
council I-ORG
is O
sovereign O
- O
comments O
Molinari B-PER
, O
who O
has O
invoked O
to O
himself O
the O
specific O
competence O
- O
But O
personally O
I O
consider O
more O
productive O
a O
constant O
circulation O
of O
information O
at O
the O
conference O
of O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
group O
. O

We O
do O
not O
put O
our O
hand O
on O
the O
fire O
but O
think O
of O
a O
confirmation O
of O
the O
committee O
in O
question O
therefore O
seems O
unrealistic O
. O

Here O
is O
the O
junta O
therefore O
, O
here O
is O
the O
government O
team O
that O
will O
guide O
the O
choices O
and O
development O
of O
Riva B-LOC
in O
the O
next O
five O
years O
. O

Strongly O
anchored O
in O
the O
center O
, O
with O
a O
deputy O
mayor O
like O
Mosaner B-PER
( O
Ds B-ORG
) O
strong O
but O
apparently O
isolated O
. O

Trusted O
men O
, O
of O
few O
words O
, O
of O
very O
few O
utterances O
, O
who O
before O
did O
not O
however O
pass O
to O
the O
scrutiny O
of O
their O
" O
general O
" O
. O

But O
from O
the O
birth O
and O
composition O
of O
this O
junta O
comes O
a O
political O
consideration O
that O
mainly O
concerns O
the O
Margaret B-ORG
. O

Today O
, O
with O
Tanas B-PER
out O
of O
the O
executive O
and O
the O
former O
leader O
Valandro B-PER
who O
obtained O
only O
the O
confirmation O
of O
the O
delegation O
to O
youth O
policies O
, O
the O
socialist O
wing O
of O
the O
rival O
civic O
comes O
out O
objectively O
reduced O
, O
almost O
frustrated O
in O
its O
aspirations O
. O

That O
wing O
that O
before O
and O
more O
than O
others O
" O
broken O
" O
with O
dissidents O
led O
by O
Pietro B-PER
Matteotti I-PER
. O

Those O
dissidents O
, O
with O
the O
same O
former O
deputy O
mayor O
in O
mind O
, O
who O
never O
hid O
their O
desire O
to O
" O
great O
center O
" O
and O
return O
to O
a O
different O
Margaret B-ORG
, O
comforted O
by O
promises O
that O
someone O
must O
have O
made O
them O
. O

Today O
in O
this O
sense O
comes O
a O
contradictory O
signal O
. O

But O
today O
is O
today O
. O

And O
tomorrow O
is O
another O
day O

of O
Terlago B-LOC

then O
supported O
the O

accusation O
in O
the O

in O
his O
appeal O
retraced O
the O
entire O
trial O
step O

step O
and O
- O
in O
a O
long O
act O

pages O

highlighted O
all O
those O
who O
in O
his O
opinion O
were O
the O
contradictions O
in O
which O
the O
court O
fell O
. O

According O
to O
the O
accusation O
the O
conviction O
should O
have O
been O
much O
heavier O
because O
the O

should O
have O
recognized O

What O
seems O
to O
be O
able O
to O
perceive O
in O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
Court B-ORG
- O
read O
in O
the O
act O
of O

- O
is O
the O
desire O
, O
almost O
irrational O
as O
opposed O
to O

, O
to O
mentally O
eliminate O
all O

Giardina B-PER
also O
criticizes O
the O

attitude O
held O
by O
the O
accused O
by O
noting O
how O
Isabella B-PER
has O
kept O
a O
false O
and O
retiring O
behavior O
on O
numerous O
occasions O

, O
after O

told O
a O

when O
she O
decided O
to O

she O
did O
nothing O

throw O
at O
the O
Cattoni B-PER

. O

Finally O
, O
the O
process O
has O
been O
repaired O
behind O
the O
protective O
screen O
of O
spontaneous O
declarations O
. O

In O
short O
for O
the O
pm O
the O
defendant O
deserves O
no O
discount O
and O
for O
this O
reason O
would O
have O
caused O
the O
judges O
to O
grant O
the O
general O
attenuators O
. O

The O
court B-ORG
begins O
by O
highlighting O
the O
Kafkian O
situation O
of O
a O
general O
and O
indiscriminate O
concession O
of O
general O
attenuators O
in O
a O
legal O
system O
in O
which O
generics O

not O

to O
anyone O
provided O
that O
the O
minimum O

But O
when O
she O
was O
young O
and O
uncensored O
as O
she O
was O
, O
she O
was O
able O
to O
orchestrate O

with O
lucid O
premeditation O

carry O
out O
with O
cold O
determination O

a O
violent O
homicide O

cruel O

ignoble O
more O
than O
it O
could O

During O
its O
long O
existence O

it O
dies O
at O
97 O

continues O
to O
deepen O
visions O

in O
the O
culture O
of O
the O
late O
nineteenth O

remains O
always O
faithful O
to O

without O

It O
remains O

apart O

therefore O
lives O
in O
a O
century O
that O
escapes O
it O
for O
philosophical O
and O
aesthetic O
premises O

His O
landscapes O
represent O
mostly O
scenes O
of O
peasant O
life O
always O
accompanied O
by O
an O
intense O
feeling O

The O
most O
intense O
season O
in O

activity O
of O
Fornara B-PER
goes O
from O
1891 O
to O
1897 O

years O
of O
evolution O
that O
lead O
to O
the O
overcoming O
of O
the O
canons O
assimilated O
by O
the O
lesson O
of O
Horses B-PER

the O
rethinking O
of O
the O
subjects O

in O

passes O
from O
the O
portrait O
to O
the O
whole O
figure O
, O
from O
the O
still O
nature O
, O
in O
depth O
especially O
during O
the O
stay O
in O
Lyon B-LOC

to O
the O
genre O
scenes O
. O

He O
moves O
away O
from O
the O
portrait O
and O
the O
fine O
landscape O
in O
himself O
and O
in O
a O
short O
time O
he O
takes O
possession O
of O
a O
brilliant O
palette O
and O
a O
painting O
space O
no O
longer O
unified O
, O
but O
realized O
through O
flat O
fields O
that O
block O
the O
movement O

the O

He O
spent O
most O
of O
his O
years O
, O
excluding O
the O
lucky O

in O

his O

however O
only O
until O
1922 O
, O
in O
the O
isolation O

away O
from O
what O
he O
himself O
defines O
as O
the O
ephemeral O

he O
waves O
the O
modern O
soul O

Nature O
is O
the O
main O

nature O

he O
assimilated O
the O
lesson O
without O
being O
a O
slave O
of O
his O
vision O
. O

The O
summer O
transhumances O
, O
like O
Fontanalba B-LOC
of O
1904 O
/ O
1908 O
, O
that O
want O
to O
be O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
tribute O
to O
Segantini B-PER
, O
are O
works O
of O
great O
breath O
in O
which O
the O
acid O
colors O
often O
return O
the O
rarefied O
mountain O
light O
without O
being O
faithful O
to O
the O
real O
ones O
. O

Then O
there O
are O
allusive O
references O
to O
the O
Segantini O
concept O
of O
the O
half O
hour O
, O
which O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
dusk O
, O
but O
the O
great O
solitude O
of O
the O
alpine O
pasture O
, O
interrupted O
only O
by O
the O
mooing O
of O
the O
cow O
. O

With O
Segantini B-PER
Fornara B-PER
comes O
in O
contact O
thanks O
to O
the O
intervention O
of O
Grubicy B-PER
who O
will O
do O
it O
Â O
hire O
by O
Segantini B-PER
himself O
as O
assistant O
for O
the O
Panorama O
of O
the O
Engadine O
work O
that O
he O
was O
preparing O
for O
the O
Exposition O
Universelle O
. O

While O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
this O
will O
represent O
a O
fortune O
for O
Fornara B-PER
on O
the O
other O
it O
will O
also O
create O
numerous O
misunderstandings O
for O
the O
developments O
of O
his O
art O
; O

He O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
although O
rich O
in O
an O
academic O
formation O
that O
Segantini B-PER
had O
not O
and O
opened O
up O
to O
a O
modernist O
vision O
of O
French O
imprint O
, O
stands O
against O
the O
teacher O
in O
an O
unparalleled O
attitude O
, O
almost O
of O
psychological O
subjection O
. O

A O
confrontation O
for O
him O
heavy O
that O
will O
turn O
from O
veneration O
into O
worship O
after O
the O
sudden O
and O
tragic O
death O
of O
Segantini B-PER
, O
less O
than O
a O
year O
after O
the O
beginning O
of O
their O
relationship O
. O

It O
will O
become O
even O
more O
difficult O
for O
him O
to O
detach O
himself O
from O
the O
teacher O
's O
message O
also O
because O
Alberto B-PER
Grubicy I-PER
will O
invest O
him O
with O
the O
role O
of O
Segantinian O
heir O
of O
the O
poetry O
of O
the O
mountain O
" O
. O

But O
the O
high O
mountain O
landscapes O
of O
Fornara B-PER
have O
a O
sharpness O
and O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
calm O
serenity O
that O
is O
not O
reflected O
in O
the O
work O
of O
Segantini B-PER
. O

Divisionism O
is O
used O
to O
give O
the O
work O
a O
particular O
luminosity O
; O

His O
are O
not O
places O
of O
mind O
but O
places O
where O
he O
is O
really O
lived O
since O
childhood O
. O

His O
paintings O
, O
then O
, O
are O
the O
transcription O
of O
environments O
loved O
and O
known O
always O
: O

He O
succeeds O
in O
transforming O
a O
fragment O
of O
landscape O
into O
a O
moment O
of O
peasant O
life O
, O
into O
an O
evocative O
vision O

Dellai B-PER
's O
bump O
does O
n't O
take O
far O
( O
follows O
from O
the O
first O
page O
) O

Certainly O
when O
I O
read O
in O
this O
newspaper O
that O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
Dellai B-PER
, O
looks O
with O
interest O
at O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
political O
framework O
and O
in O
particular O
to O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
the O
Centre O
and O
in O
the O
Patt B-ORG
my O
memory O
can O
not O
fail O
to O
go O
to O
the O
last O
congress O
of O
the O
PPI B-ORG
, O
held O
eighteen O
months O
ago O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
defeated O
because O
I O
supported O
the O
need O
that O
the O
current O
majority O
if O
they O
really O
wanted O
to O
pursue O
a O
reform O
policy O
should O
" O
recompose O
" O
with O
the O
center O
of O
Valduga B-PER
Giovanazzi B-PER
and O
Conci B-PER
and O
re O
- O
establish O
an O
organic O
and O
strategic O
alliance O
with O
the O
Pact B-ORG
. O

I O
was O
directly O
accused O
, O
in O
a O
gross O
way O
, O
by O
Betta B-PER
, O
now O
Senator O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
, O
and O
indirectly O
by O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Council I-ORG
Dellai B-PER
, O
of O
being O
proponents O
of O
the O
" O
reelstone O
" O
by O
comparing O
myself O
to O
the O
worst O
figures O
of O
the O
political O
landscape O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
I O
was O
reprimanded O
for O
wanting O
to O
keep O
the O
PPI B-ORG
alive O
instead O
of O
aiming O
for O
its O
liquidation O
to O
give O
life O
to O
the O
Margaret B-ORG
. O

And O
now O
, O
in O
Rome B-LOC
, O
those O
who O
supported O
this O
thesis O
have O
" O
closed O
" O
with O
the O
national O
Margaret B-ORG
to O
create O
an O
autonomous O
group O
of O
no O
senators O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
safeguard O
of O
autonomy O
. O

But O
autonomy O
saves O
her O
, O
if O
they O
believe O
it O
, O
the O
great O
sides O
and O
certainly O
not O
seven O
or O
eight O
senators O
. O

And O
on O
that O
occasion O
, O
finally O
, O
he O
shouted O
to O
the O
four O
winds O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
junta B-ORG
would O
never O
touch O
and O
that O
it O
would O
brilliantly O
end O
the O
legislature O
. O

Yet O
it O
did O
not O
take O
long O
to O
understand O
that O
without O
majority O
in O
the O
legislative O
committees O
, O
without O
numbers O
in O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
and O
with O
a O
political O
climate O
between O
opposition O
and O
majority O
that O
suffers O
( O
in O
some O
respects O
understandably O
) O
from O
the O
violence O
suffered O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
legislature O
and O
without O
political O
forces O
able O
to O
independently O
seek O
a O
progressive O
recomposition O
became O
a O
chimera O
to O
think O
of O
a O
government O
capable O
of O
grafting O
a O
reformist O
march O
. O

Now O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Council I-ORG
and O
leader O
of O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
nostrana O
, O
as O
far O
as O
can O
be O
guessed O
from O
the O
journalistic O
interpretations O
, O
is O
attentive O
to O
what O
happens O
in O
the O
Centre O
and O
in O
what O
remains O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
after O
the O
expropriation O
immediately O
by O
this O
party O
, O
thanks O
also O
to O
its O
initiative O
, O
with O
the O
invention O
of O
the O
Gentians B-ORG
. O

Better O
late O
than O
never O
, O
recite O
an O
old O
adage O
. O

But O
does O
this O
" O
thinking O
" O
serve O
to O
" O
sew O
up O
" O
a O
political O
framework O
, O
or O
does O
it O
serve O
to O
resolve O
some O
personal O
issues O
, O
or O
, O
again O
, O
does O
it O
simply O
serve O
Dellai B-PER
to O
remain O
firmly O
in O
his O
place O
and O
secure O
a O
standing O
as O
leader O
of O
the O
outgoing O
coalition O
? O

Probably O
the O
truth O
is O
a O
jam O
that O
contains O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
everything O
. O

But O
whatever O
the O
outcome O
of O
this O
path O
is O
all O
too O
evident O
that O
the O
" O
crisis O
" O

It O
is O
deeper O
and O
it O
would O
be O
a O
big O
mistake O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
future O
fate O
of O
the O
center O
- O
left O
, O
to O
limit O
it O
to O
the O
junta B-ORG
structure O
alone O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
return O
to O
the O
parties O

( O
and O
not O
exclusively O
personal O
movements O
) O
the O
task O
of O
redesigning O
a O
path O
to O
the O
future O
of O
this O
land O
will O
hardly O
be O
able O
to O
respond O
to O
the O
current O
political O
crisis O
. O

The O
risk O
is O
that O
everything O
will O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
a O
question O
of O
numbers O
and O
therefore O
to O
a O
sort O
of O
" O
market O
" O
of O
advisors O
. O

And O
the O
even O
greater O
risk O
is O
that O
, O
by O
playing O
a O
few O
words O
, O
you O
give O
to O
resolve O
the O
political O
crisis O
simply O
by O
giving O
an O
answer O
only O
on O
the O
level O
of O
numbers O
. O

And O
you O
ca O
n't O
even O
, O
especially O
for O
people O
and O
parties O
interested O
in O
this O
reshuffle O
, O
forget O
what O
has O
happened O
in O
these O
years O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
there O
are O
some O
" O
headlines O
" O
of O
topics O
that O
should O
be O
further O
explored O
. O

Who O
has O
worked O
for O
the O
destruction O
of O
parties O
, O
who O
has O
preached O
the O
primacy O
of O
the O
new O
for O
the O
new O
, O
who O
considers O
as O
the O
only O
depositary O
of O
power O
( O
regardless O
of O
the O
process O
that O
determines O
it O
) O
the O
institutional O
data O
, O
who O
has O
made O
the O
generational O
belief O
a O
political O
fact O
, O
who O
has O
interpreted O
, O
also O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
management O
of O
power O
, O
all O
this O
, O
can O
be O
the O
future O
interpreter O
of O
a O
political O
phase O
that O
in O
order O
to O
be O
solid O
will O
have O
to O
be O
based O
on O
a O
relegitimation O
of O
the O
role O
and O
function O
of O
the O
parties O
? O

And O
those O
political O
forces O
, O
especially O
the O
Centre O
, O
which O
today O
are O
concerned O
or O
are O
pushed O
or O
attracted O
by O
a O
government O
experience O
weaken O
or O
strengthen O
the O
role O
they O
might O
have O
in O
the O
future O
? O

It O
is O
more O
useful O
electorally O
, O
also O
considered O
the O
national O
wave O
, O
to O
be O
" O
homogenized O
" O
by O
the O
current O
leadership O
or O
instead O
it O
might O
be O
more O
useful O
to O
work O
on O
a O
provincial O
political O
order O
that O
gives O
political O
forces O
their O
autonomy O
, O
their O
dignity O
even O
within O
a O
coalition O
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
possibility O
of O
having O
a O
less O
conditioned O
role O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
even O
here O
legitimate O
personal O
ambitions O
come O
into O
play O
, O
but O
a O
party O
, O
slowly O
and O
with O
a O
capacity O
for O
persuasion O
, O
should O
prevail O
a O
design O
less O
linked O
to O
the O
contingent O
also O
because O
it O
does O
not O
necessarily O
represent O
a O
resource O
. O

It O
can O
be O
, O
instead O
, O
a O
problem O
. O

Then O
on O
the O
table O
there O
is O
a O
broader O
discourse O
about O
the O
strategy O
, O
coupled O
obviously O
with O
the O
contents O
, O
that O
the O
center O
- O
left O
will O
have O
to O
elaborate O
in O
order O
to O
reject O
the O
attack O
of O
the O
center O
- O
right O
. O

A O
question O
to O
which O
it O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
answer O
, O
but O
if O
a O
possibility O
of O
success O
exists O
, O
this O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
rooting O
of O
political O
forces O
, O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
resumption O
of O
some O
strands O
that O
have O
been O
" O
reference O
points O
" O
for O
thousands O
of O
people O
and O
that O
someone O
has O
severed O
with O
too O
much O
superficiality O
and O
cynicism O
. O

Certainly O
in O
recent O
years O
the O
national O
and O
local O
political O
and O
institutional O
framework O
has O
undergone O
profound O
changes O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
that O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
this O
land O
are O
all O
emigrated O
to O
the O
Maldives B-LOC
and O
it O
is O
not O
even O
true O
that O
the O
Trentino B-LOC
has O
suffered O
an O
invasion O
or O
has O
been O
occupied O
by O
extraterrestrials O
that O
have O
imposed O
a O
new O
way O
of O
being O
and O
thinking O
. O

Now O
, O
after O
the O
thunderstorms O
of O
newism O
at O
all O
costs O
( O
but O
time O
should O
also O
pass O
for O
those O
who O
have O
made O
newism O
an O
ideology O
! O
) O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
resume O
the O
difficult O
work O
of O
a O
resumption O
of O
political O
taste O
which O
is O
based O
on O
a O
just O
separation O
, O
which O
does O
not O
mean O
indifference O
, O
between O
political O
engagement O
in O
parties O
, O
movements O
in O
associations O
and O
political O
engagement O
in O
the O
institutions O
. O

It O
should O
be O
recalled O
that O
confusion O
is O
never O
useful O
for O
the O
consolidation O
of O
a O
laborious O
participatory O
democracy O
, O
but O
rather O
shortcuts O
behind O
which O
only O
rubble O
remains O
. O

it O

not O
the O

Retirement O
teacher O
( O
euphemistic O
the O
term O
" O
resting O
" O
, O
but O
in O
my O
opinion O
this O
phrase O
is O
much O
preferable O
to O
the O
depressing O
qualification O
of O
" O
retirement O
" O
, O
I O
speak O
neither O
in O
partisan O
spirit O
nor O
in O
professional O
deformation O

Nor O
do O
I O
go O
into O
the O
merits O
of O
the O
very O
questionable O
reforms O
that O
we O
have O
undergone O
in O
the O
continuous O
succession O
of O
Ministers O
for O
Education B-ORG
. O

However O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
strongly O
deny O
the O
repeated O
and O
unfounded O
accusation O
of O
" O
unacceptable O
and O
blatant O
injustices O
" O
for O
which O
teachers O
would O
be O
guilty O
: O

just O
as O
I O
deny O
that O
their O
working O
hours O
are O
less O
than O
the O
hours O
of O
other O
workers O
, O
just O
because O
working O
hours O
are O
otherwise O
distributed O
, O
as O
well O
as O
rejecting O
all O
the O
hateful O
resentment O
that O
continues O
to O
be O
expressed O
by O
many O
pupils O
( O
and O
often O
even O
parents O
) O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
public O
opinion O
) O
against O
the O
teaching O
class O
. O

In O
every O
context O
of O
human O
society O
there O
are O
honest O
people O
and O
dishonest O
people O
, O
workers O
engaged O
, O
qualified O
and O
correct O
in O
the O
face O
of O
disengaged O
, O
inept O
and O
opportunist O
workers O
. O

In O
the O
very O
delicate O
field O
of O
teaching O
, O
giving O
the O
necessary O
notions O
should O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
educational O
function O
, O
which O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
" O
puffiness O
" O
, O
but O
not O
even O
with O
the O
widespread O
permissiveism O
today O
of O
fashion O
. O

No O
one O
is O
infallible O
, O
some O
evaluation O
may O
be O
wrong O
, O
some O
unworthy O
teacher O
may O
also O
commit O
favoritism O
( O
however O
widespread O
custom O
in O
the O
world O
of O
politics O
and O
entrepreneurship O
far O
more O
than O
in O
the O
world O
of O
school O
) O

This O
does O
not O
justify O
the O
absurd O
and O
slanderous O
statements O
that O
students O
and O
families O
throw O
unpunished O
and O
indiscriminately O
against O
the O
teaching O
class O
. O

Perhaps O
if O
a O
little O
less O
laxity O
and O
a O
little O
more O
commitment O
were O
imposed O
in O
the O
school O
itself O
, O
if O
a O
little O
less O
recreation O
was O
allowed O
. O

( O
from O
the O
raging O
of O
discotheques O
to O
the O
unbridled O
use O
of O
media O
) O
and O
young O
people O
were O
stimulated O
to O
a O
more O
serious O
application O
, O
if O
they O
were O
invented O
a O
little O
less O
baldly O
innovative O
laws O
, O
if O
the O
TAR O
were O
a O
little O
less O
indulgent O
and O
spread O
at O
all O
levels O
a O
little O
more O
healthy O
balance O
, O
we O
would O
have O
less O
explosion O
of O
violence O
camouflaged O
by O
pseudoideal O
, O
less O
aggressiveness O
and O
greater O
mutual O
respect O
. O

And O
maybe O
this O
is O
the O
sense O
of O
a O
true O
, O
authentic O
education O

allow O
myself O
, O
having O
experienced O
the O
problems O
of O

fifteen O
years O

to O
point O
out O
that O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
parking O

with O
a O
capacity O
of O
175 O
parking O
spaces O
must O
make O
it O
reflect O
before O
the O

is O
used O
for O

in O

The O
presence O
of O

in O

as O

commercial O
offices O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
freeing O
rest O
areas O
on O
surface O
roads O
, O
requires O
a O
serious O
study O
of O
the O
maintenance O
and O
development O
of O
this O
structure O
. O

It O
is O
also O
appropriate O
for O
a O
public O
or O
private O
service O
, O
which O
provides O
guarantees O
and O
comfort O
to O
those O
who O
wish O
to O
benefit O
from O
it O

have O
positive O

beneficiaries O
of O

that O

, O
will O
undoubtedly O
be O
inclined O
to O
pay O
a O
fair O
fee O
. O

With O
this O
in O
mind O
, O
it O
seems O
impossible O
that O
with O
the O
technical O
and O
electronic O
means O
currently O
available O
there O
is O
no O
control O
system O
for O
this O
parking O
that O
allows O
the O
daily O
or O
temporary O
stopover O
or O
subscription O
to O
those O
who O
want O
to O
take O

it O

With O

believe O
that O

axis O
of O
Durnwalder B-PER

Dellai B-PER
. O

But O
he O
wanted O
to O
give O
two O
warnings O
. O

The O
first O
is O
that O
of O
not O
extending O
too O
much O
the O
staff O
of O
public O
administrations O
. O

That O
's O
like O
saying O
: O

be O
careful O
not O
to O
multiply O
public O
spending O
unnecessarily O
, O
creating O
pletoric O
bureaucratic O
apartments O
( O
tempt O
from O
which O
the O
two O
Provinces O
and O
the O
same O
Region B-LOC
are O
not O
immune O
) O
. O

And O
the O
other O
warning O
is O
that O
the O
new O
phase O
of O
autonomy O
will O
give O
space O
to O
civil O
society O
. O

That O
means O
, O
in O
the O
words O
of O
Ciampi B-PER
, O
space O
for O
the O
private O
sector O
, O
allowing O
it O
to O
carry O
out O
functions O
that O
the O
public O
sector O
sometimes O
tends O
to O
appropriate O
, O
with O
the O
risk O
of O
holding O
them O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
an O
excess O
of O

The O
nullity O
