which O

carried O

Pope O

recalled O
his O

name O
has O
always O
been O

with O
applause O

Central O
to O
this O
first O
day O
was O
for O
Benedict B-PER
XVI I-PER
the O
invitation O
to O
young O
people O
to O
seek O
in O
the O
faith O
something O
capable O
of O
giving O
meaning O
to O
their O
lives O

It O
is O
addressed O
to O
believers O
and O
“ O
far O
away O
” O
people O
, O
even O
to O
those O
who O
, O
like O
the O
Magi B-PER
“ O
come O
from O
the O
East O

: O

And O
someone O
has O
also O
wanted O
to O
see O
a O
possible O
reference O
to O
the O
youth O
of O
the O
underground O
Chinese O
Church B-ORG

“ O
I O
greet O

even O
those O
of O
you O

not O
yet O
know O
Christ B-PER
or O
who O
do O
not O
recognize O
themselves O
in O
the O
Church B-ORG

It O
is O
to O
you O
that O
Pope O
John B-PER
Paul I-PER
II I-PER
addressed O
a O
special O
invitation O
to O
this O
meeting O
. O

Thank O
you O

Cologne B-LOC

” O

Finally O
, O
addressed O
to O
the O
young O
people O
in O
search O
of O
values O
, O
“ O
preoccupied O
with O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
world O
” O
, O
who O
want O
to O
know O
how O
to O
build O
a O
future O
, O
Benedict B-PER
XVI I-PER
replies O
that O
“ O
to O
ask O
such O
questions O
means O
first O
and O
foremost O
to O
recognize O
that O
the O
journey O
is O
not O
completed O
until O
one O
has O
met O
Him O
who O
has O
the O
power O
to O
establish O
that O
universal O
Kingdom O
of O
justice O
and O
peace O
to O
which O
men O
aspire O
, O
but O
which O
they O
can O
not O
build O
on O
their O
own O
. O
” O

Asking O
such O
questions O
then O
means O
seeking O
Someone O
who O
is O
not O
deceived O
and O
can O
not O
deceive O
and O
is O
therefore O
able O
to O
offer O
such O
a O
firm O
certainty O
that O
it O
allows O
to O
live O
for O
it O
and O
, O
in O
the O
event O
, O
even O
to O
die O
. O

The O
“ O

Spanish O
Prime O

Zapatero I-PER
has O
announced O
that O
, O
if O
it O
continues O
so O
, O
“ O
before O
the O

will O
go O
to O

to O
ask O
for O
the O
free O
way O
to O
negotiate O
with O
the O
Basque O
independentists O
to O
end O
a O
conflict O
that O
has O
cost O
a O
thousand O

“ O
I O
can O
confirm O
that O
all O

the O

complete O

it O
is O
true O

” O
Zapatero B-PER
said O
, O
stressing O
that O
if O
it O
continues O
, O
a O
dialogue O
with O
ETA B-ORG
will O
begin O
to O
end O
the O
violence O
. O

Zapatero B-PER
had O
obtained O
a O
parliamentary B-ORG
authorization O
last O
year O
to O
open O
a O
dialogue O
with O
the O
ETA B-ORG
if O
it O
had O
given O
up O
violence O
, O
and O
the O
prime O
minister O
had O
pledged O
to O
return O
before O
the O

when O
there O
was O
certainty O
that O
this O
was O
happening O
in O
order O
to O
start O
the O
negotiations O

According O
to O
observers O
, O
after O
he O
went O
to O
parliament O
, O
Zapatero B-PER
will O
begin O
contacts O
with O
the O
ETA B-ORG
and O
may O
decide O
on O
a O
“ O
approximation O
” O
of O
Basque O
political O
prisoners O
to O
their O
region O
of O
origin O
, O
one O
of O
the O
ETA B-ORG
’s O
demands O
. O

Subsequently O
put O
in O
motion O
a O
process O
for O
the O
legalization O
of O
the O
independentist B-ORG
party I-ORG
Batasuna I-ORG

considered O
a O
political O
arm O

the O
ETA B-ORG

put O
out O

But O
, O
when O
asked O
about O
this O
by O
the O
Ser B-ORG
, O
the O
prime O

did O
not O
confirm O
or O
deny O

stressing O
that O
" O
every O

the O

can O
take O

have O
to O
be O
comforted O
by O
the O
support O
of O
the O
political O

and O
the O
certainty O
of O
the O
end O

Yesterday O
in O
an O
interview O
with O
the O

El B-ORG

the O
prime O

had O
assured O
that O

the O
weapon O
and O
use O
it O
to O
disable O
the O
vehicle O
, O
targeting O
the O
engine O
and O
wheels O
. O

Finally O
, O
if O
the O
vehicle O
had O
not O
stopped O
yet O
, O
it O
would O
have O
had O
to O
continue O
shooting O

engage O
the O

habitacle O
as O
well O

Only O
five O
days O

the O

That O
evening O
, O
therefore O
, O
Lozano B-PER
was O
on O
the O
tower O
when O
the O
Toyota O
Corolla O
driven O
by O
Carpani B-PER
approached O
the O
blockade O
at O
a O
speed O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
various O
testimonies O
of O
the O
American O
military O
, O
ranged O
from O
50 O
to O
80 O
miles O

Testimonials O
that O
, O
the O
report O
emphasizes O
, O
“ O

by O

factors O

” O

For O
example O
, O
the O
machine O
gunman O
felt O
threatened O
and O
said O
that O
he O
had O
thought O
of O
his O
daughters O
while O
frenetically O
counting O
the O
seconds O
, O
observing O
the O
space O
travelled O
by O
the O
car O
, O
performing O
the O
mathematical O
operations O
necessary O
to O
calculate O
the O
speed O
of O
the O
vehicle O
that O
is O
approaching O
inexorably O
, O
screaming O
with O
a O
crawl O
, O
but O
no O
other O
soldier O
heard O
the O
screams O
screaming O
to O
be O
heard O
by O
the O
Toyota O
driver O
, O
acting O
with O
his O
right O
hand O
warning O
shots O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
lawn O
to O
his O
left O
, O
throwing O
off O
the O
lamp O
while O
changing O
the O
lighting O
conditions O
of O
the O
ramp O
with O
both O
hands O
, O
turning O
to O
the O
car O
that O
has O
now O
reached O
a O
distance O
too O
close O
for O
a O
suspicious O
autobomb O

shooting O
ahead O

the O

try O
to O

The O
whole O
thing O

it O
is O
revealed O

in O
a O
few O
seconds O

” O

And O
so O
the O
machine O
gun O
fired O
“ O
at O

two O
shots O
nearby O

” O

The O
11 O
bullets O

7.62 O
that O

the O

according O
to O

experts O

So O
the O

Giancarlo B-PER

yesterday O
outlined O
the O
scenario O

scattered O
between O
Friday O

Saturday O

buried O
in O
the O

of O
her O
home O
in O
Sarezzo B-LOC
( O

. O

An O
execution O
decided O
to O
punish O
the O
girl O
for O
her O
choice O
to O
live O
in O
the O
West O
, O
rebelling O
to O
the O
rigid O
impositions O
of O
the O
tradition O
and O
the O
will O
of O
her O
father O
, O
who O
had O
already O
combined O
a O
marriage O
for O
her O
in O
Pakistan B-LOC

“ O
We O
hope O
to O
capture O
a O
third O
of O
Hina B-PER
’s O
murderers O
soon O
, O
” O
the O
judge O
said O
. O

The O
horrible O
crime O
, O
Tarquini B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
punishment O
inflicted O
by O
the O
father O
on O
a O
daughter O
who O
had O
not O
respected O
the O
rules O
of O
Pakistani O
ethnicity O
and O
culture O
. O

It O
is O
cruelty O
that O
sometimes O
also O
arises O
from O
religious O
beliefs O
or O
beliefs O
that O
should O
lead O
to O
everything O
else O
, O
that O
is O
, O
to O
respect O
for O
life O
. O
” O

“ O
I O
think O
that O
Muslim O
religion O
also O
leads O
to O
respect O
for O
life O
, O
and O
not O
the O
opposite O
, O
” O
the O
magistrate O
said O
. O

Those O
who O
commit O
crimes O
in O
the O
name O
of O
religion O
violate O
religion O
itself O
and O
its O
inspiring O
principles O
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
was O
Islam O
that O
caused O
this O
tragedy O
. O

His O
incorrect O
reading O
has O
, O
however O
, O
turned O
into O
an O
aberration O
. O

According O
to O
the O
prosecutor O
, O
Hina B-PER
’s O
murderers O
are O
father O
Mohamed B-PER
Saleem I-PER
, O
51 O
, O
uncle O
Mohamad B-PER
Tariq I-PER

( O

and O
the O
younger O
husband O
of O
Hina B-PER

older O
sister O
. O

To O
cut O
the O
throat O
to O
Hina B-PER
would O
have O
been O
the O
father O
, O
with O
the O
full O
cooperation O
of O
the O
other O
two O
. O

The O
accusation O
is O
the O
same O
for O
everyone O
. O

Premeditated O
murder O
and O
covering O
of O
bodies O
. O

The O
prosecutor O
has O
long O
stood O
on O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
premeditation O
: O

It O
is O
assumed O
that O
the O
girl O
had O
been O
invited O
home O
with O
deception O
and O
that O
the O
mother O
and O
the O
brothers O
moved O
away O
so O
that O
they O
could O
act O
without O
disturbance O
. O

The O
relationship O
between O
the O
young O
man O
and O
his O
father O
had O
not O
been O
good O
for O
years O
. O

He O
could O
not O
tolerate O
that O
the O
girl O
dressed O
in O
the O
west O
, O
worked O
in O
the O
evening O
( O
in O
a O
bar O
in O
Brescia B-LOC
) O
and O
went O
to O
locations O
and O
places O
of O
entertainment O
frequented O
by O
Italians O
. O

Hina B-PER
was O
in O
all O
effect O
westernized O
: O

She O
also O
had O
two O
tattoos O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
did O
not O
want O
to O
know O
about O
a O
marriage O
already O
arranged O
for O
her O
by O
her O
father O
in O
Pakistan B-LOC
. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
understood O
whether O
and O
how O
much O
Saleem B-PER
knew O
of O
the O
daughter O
’s O
relationship O
with O
Giuseppe B-PER
Tampini I-PER
, O
the O
33 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
carpenter O
with O
whom O
the O
girl O
actually O
lived O
for O
more O
than O
a O
year O
. O

Since O
the O
day O
of O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
girl O
’s O
body O
, O
last O
Saturday O
, O
the O
young O
man O
has O
been O
out O
of O
himself O
for O
pain O

The O
crime O
has O
also O
shaken O
the O
political O
community O

According O
to O
Interior O
Minister O
Giuliano B-PER
Amato I-PER
, O
“ O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Pakistani O
girl O
murdered O
by O
her O
father O
teaches O
a O
lot O
in O
terms O
of O
citizenship O
, O
because O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
ask O
for O
adherence O
to O
the O
values O
of O
the O
Constitution O
” O
, O
but O
there O
must O
also O
be O
an O
adherence O
to O
“ O
fundamental O
rights O
such O
as O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
woman O
respects O
herself O
according O
to O
rules O
that O
I O
consider O
universal O
” O
. O

The O
minister O
then O
added O
that O
a O
right O
to O
be O
considered O
universal O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
“ O
woman O
has O
the O
right O
to O
choose O
her O

Tofi I-PER

says O
Hina B-PER

murder O
is O
“ O
an O
unquestionably O
condemned O
gesture O

” O

The O
man O
explains O
that O
the O
Hina B-PER
tragedy O
“ O
can O
generate O
hatred O
towards O
us O
if O
it O

treated O

Alfredo B-PER
Mantovano I-PER

An B-ORG

believes O
that O
" O
implicitly O
makes O
merit O
to O
the O
wisdom O
of O
those O
who O
, O
like O
the O
former O

Pisanu B-PER

orders O
the O
expulsion O

it O
is O
dangerous O
for O

" O
. O

In O

this O
, O
it O
is O
important B-PER

that O

increase O

“ O

For O
Isabella B-PER
Bertolini I-PER
( O
Forza B-ORG

) O
the O
verdict O
“ O
is O
good O
news O
: O

It O
gives O
right O
to O
those O
who O
believe O
that O
the O

are O
priorities O
for O

denies O

A O
campaign O
of O
assault O
against O
the O
left O
, O
even O
harder O
than O
that O
of O
2001 O
: O

Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
re O
- O
proposes O
to O
the O
allies O
his O
eternal O
recipe O
to O
defeat O
Prodi B-PER
and O
stay O
in O
the O
government O
in O
the O
new O
legislature O
. O

The O
political O
analysis O
is O
simple O
: O

The O
Italians O
are O
a O
people O
of O
moderates O
, O
they O
will O
not O
hand O
over O
the O
keys O
to O
power O
to O
a O
coalition O
that O
has O
no O
program O
. O

In O
the O
regional O
elections O
, O
the O
CDU B-ORG
lost O
due O
to O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
disappointed O
. O

However O
, O
the O
prime O
minister O
realizes O
that O
news O
is O
needed O
and O
the O
announcement O
of O
a O
single O
party O
slide O
does O
not O
reassure O
the O
dissatisfied O
, O
Udc B-ORG
and O
An B-ORG
in O
primis O
. O

It O
will O
be O
seen O
today O
how O
the O
last O
moves O
of O
the O
Knight O
will O
be O
evaluated O
at O
the O
Udc B-ORG
Congress O
and O
the O
National O
Assembly O
of O
An B-ORG
: O

The O
impression O
is O
that O
the O
allies O
are O
ripped O
on O
themselves O
, O
looking O
for O
an O
electoral O
strategy O
. O

It O
is O
not O
by O
chance O
that O
Alemanno B-PER
asks O
that O
An B-ORG
hold O
a O
programmatic O
conference O
by O
the O
year O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
“ O
new O
Fiuggi O
” O
, O
as O
a O
condition O
not O
to O
give O
birth O
to O
an O
internal O
minority O
( O
and O
it O
would O
be O
the O
first O
time O
that O
Fini B-PER
would O
not O
get O
unanimous O
in O
his O
party O
) O
. O

In O
the O
Udc B-ORG
maybe O
Giovanardi B-PER
will O
not O
compete O
with O
Follini B-PER
also O
because O
the O
projection O
of O
the O
single O
party O
beyond O
the O
policies O
of O
2006 O
makes O
quite O
surreal O
a O
congressional O
battle O
so O
premature O
. O

But O
Berlusconi B-PER
also O
faces O
two O
other O
problems O
: O

The O
League B-ORG
and O
the O
Socialists B-ORG
. O

The O
first O
, O
as O
Bondi B-PER
recognises O
, O
remains O
for O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
“ O
a O
vital O
anchorage O
” O
and O
this O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
single O
party O
can O
not O
turn O
into O
a O
path O
against O
Bossi B-PER
: O

This O
requires O
a O
softer O
approach O
. O

As O
for O
the O
socialists O
, O
yesterday O
’s O
meeting O
between O
De B-PER
Michelis I-PER
and O
Boselli B-PER
represented O
a O
step O
forward O
on O
the O
road O
to O
socialist O
unity O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
De B-PER
Michelis I-PER
continues O
to O
repeat O
that O
the O
operation O
must O
remain O
outside O
of O
the O
“ O
schemes O
in O
force O
” O
, O
but O
once O
the O
Fed B-ORG
has O
collapsed O
socialist O
unity O
seems O
possible O
only O
within O
the O
center O
- O
left O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this B-PER
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this B-PER
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
the O
human B-LOC
being O
. O

Letizia B-PER
Moratti I-PER
will O
run O
for O
the O
mayor O
’s O
seat O

The O
real O
socialist O
reformists O
, O
argues O
the O
Knight O
, O
can O
not O
forget O
what O
the O
left O
has O
done O
to O
Bettino B-PER
Craxi I-PER

But O
the O
deputy O

Caldoro B-PER
replicates O
dry O
that O
no O
instrumentalizations O
of O
the O

of O

are O
permissible O

normal O
that O
an O

preceded O
the O

took O
place O

the O
fourth O
day O
of O

the O
regional B-ORG

It O
is O
normal O

not O
too O
much O
in O
the O
hall O
of O
the O
Puglia B-LOC
council O
where O

been O
absent O

that O
the O
regional O
adviser O

, O
Elena B-PER
Gentile I-PER
( O
Ds B-ORG

, O
has O
been O
excited O
almost O
to O
tears O
, O
publicly O
admitting O
the O
“ O
disorder O
” O
that O
in O
these O
months O
has O
“ O
taken O
her O
serenity O
” O
for O
the O
fact O
of O
not O
being O
able O
to O
understand O
the O
opponents O
, O
but O
sometimes O
also O
the O
colleagues O
of O
the O
center O

left O
, O
“ O
the O
value O

And O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
Puglia B-LOC
a O
law O
was O
dedicated O
to O
women O

and O
, O
in O

Gentile B-PER
said O

to O
a O
woman O

a O
Puglia O

her O
self O

sufficient O
child O

To O
them O
the O
“ O
first O

great O
thanks O
” O
because O
from O
them O
, O
from O
women O
, O
this O
“ O

” O
came O

And O
if O
someone O
thought O
that O
the O

was O
made O
up O
of O
“ O
rough O

wanted O

the O

Gentile B-PER
replies O
: O

“ O
We O
have O
recovered O
the O

remembering O
that O
there O

it O

to O

that O
the O

he O
added O
Gentile B-PER
– O
that O

a O
human O
law O

” O

“ O
It O
’s O
an O
invention O
of O
the O
left O
that O
seeks O
pretexts O
to O
turn O
every O
opportunity O
into O
an O
election O
struggle O

” O

Berlusconi B-PER
, O
like O
Casini B-PER
, O
will O
not O
go O
to O
the O
Pope O
on O
March O
30 O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
PPE B-ORG
congress O

which O
will O
take O
place O
in O
those O
days O
in O

In O

, O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
PPE B-ORG
group O
in O
Strasbourg B-LOC

Hans B-PER
Poettering I-PER
, O
revealed O
that O
only O
MPs O
and O
no O
prime O
ministers O
were O
invited O
to O
the O
hearing O

Berlusconi B-PER
thus O
seeks O
to O
close O
the O
controversy O
over O
his O
invitation O
to O
the O
Vatican B-LOC
by O
accusing O
the O
Union B-ORG
of O
having O
set O
up O
a O
non O
- O
existent O
case O

But O
the O
center O
- O
left O
is O
already O
struggling O
with O
an O
internal O
clash O
that O
opposes O
the O
Catholics O
of O
Margherita B-ORG
and O
the O
“ O
superlaics O
” O
of O
Rosa B-ORG
in I-ORG
the O
fist O
, O
divided O
by O
the O
judgment O
on O
the O
role O
of O
the O
Church B-ORG
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
almost O
a O
war O
of O
religion O
that O
opposes O
the O
two O
“ O

” O
of O
the O
center O

left O
, O
never O
so O
far O
away O
as O
these O
days O

It O
is O
Boselli B-PER
giving O
fire O
to O
the O
dust O

Not O
only O
would O
the O
" O
pilgrimage O
nine O
days O
from O
the O
vote O
" O
represent O
" O
a O
violation O
of O
the O
Concordat O
" O
, O
but O
the O
only O
idea O
of O
a O
Berlusconi B-PER
- O
Ratzinger B-PER
meeting O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
election O
campaign O
shows O
that O
" O
the O
Vatican B-LOC
considers O
Italy B-LOC
as O
a O
country O
with O
limited O
sovereignty O
" O
. O

Boselli B-PER
openly O
accuses O
his O
allies O
: O

“ O
From O
us O
the O
political O
forces O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
even O
those O
of O

in O
too O
many O
cases O
whispered O

silenced O

sought O
what O
Catholic O

I O
think O
it O

a O
mistake O
because O
I O
think O
freedom O
, O
modernity O
and O
secularism O
go O
hand O
in O
hand O
. O
” O

This O
is O
a O
hard O
word O
, O
which O
immediately O
triggered O
the O
reaction O
of O
the O
Catholics O
of O
the O
center O
- O
left O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
this B-PER
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life B-ORG

“ O
I O
understand O
the O
search O

given O
the O
negative O

there O

also O
a O
limit O

the O
tolerance O

daily O
insolence O

Instead O
, O
it O
is O
his O
advice O

“ O

” O

Rome B-LOC
- O
Four O
days O
before O
the O
vote O
, O
a O
strong O
call O
for O
dialogue O
on O
reforms O
was O
addressed O
to O
the O
two O
poles O
by O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
Giorgio B-PER
Napolitano I-PER
. O

During O
his O
visit O
to O
Naples B-LOC
, O
the O
head O
of O
state O
invited O
voters O
to O
go O
to O
the O
polls O
because O
“ O
the O
matter O
on O
which O
everyone O
is O
called O
to O
speak O
is O
too O
important O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
one O
thinks O
of O
it O
. O
” O

But O
Napolitano B-PER
also O
asked O
the O
two O
opposing O
groups O
, O
" O
whichever O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
vote O
" O
, O
to O
bring O
back O
to O
Parliament O
the O
discussion O
on O
reforms O
, O
" O
in O
search O
of O
the O
widest O
consensus O
" O
. O

The O
appeal O
collects O
consensus O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
company O
will O
be O
able O
to O
provide O
a O
comprehensive O
and O
comprehensive O
selection O
of O
the O
products O
and O
services O
offered O
by O
the O
company O
. O

But O
the O
clash O
between O
the O
two O
poles O
remains O
high O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
further O
duel O
between O
Berlusconi B-PER
and O
Prodi B-PER
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product B-ORG
is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
or O
the O
use O

product O

The O
referendum O
, O
he O
says O
, O
“ O
is O
an O
opportunity O
to O
say O
no O
to O
the O
Prodi O
government O
, O
with O
its O
11 O
communist O
ministers O
, O
a O
government O
in O
which O
there O
are O
ministers O
who O
go O
to O
the O
square O
along O
with O
social O
centers O
and O
with O
homosexuals O
and O
who O
nominates O
former O
terrorists O
as O
heads O
of O
parliamentary O
committees O
. O
” O

Prodi B-PER
replies O
shortly O
after O
from O
Moscow B-LOC
: O

Berlusconi B-PER
, O
the O
prime O
minister O
argues O
, O
“ O
is O
ready O
to O
ruin O
the O
Constitution O
in O
order O
to O
give O
a O
lesson O
to O
a O
government O
that O
he O
does O
not O
like O
. O
” O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
intervention O
of O
Napolitano B-PER
had O
some O
results O
. O

The O
whole O
center O
- O
right O
is O
said O
to O
be O
ready O
for O
confrontation O
with O
the O
center O
- O
left O
after O
the O
June O
25 O
vote O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
is O
no O
such O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
as O
the O
world O
, O
there O
is O
no O
such O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
as O
the O
world O
. O

Even O
the O
Leghista O
Roberto B-PER
Calderoli I-PER
, O
usually O
very O
tough O
with O
the O
head O
of O
state O
, O
puts O
aside O
the O
polemics O
and O
says O
yes O
to O
dialogue O
. O

But O
on O
one O
condition O
: O

The O
reform O
must O
be O
approved O
and O
enter O
into O
force O
immediately O
. O

“ O
Once O
it O
takes O
off O
, O
we O
can O
discuss O
how O
to O
improve O
it O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
or O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
. O

And O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Ulivo B-ORG
group O
in O
the O
Senate B-ORG
Anna B-PER
Finocchiaro I-PER
blows O
out O
as O
“ O
not O
elegant O
” O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
centre O
- O
right O
. O

But O
the O
signs O
show O
that O
reforms O
, O
beyond O
the O
outcome O
, O
may O
become O
an O
element O
of O
comparison O
between O
the O
two O
ranks O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
. O

“ O
The O
people O
of O
the O
North O
are O
good O
people O
and O
would O
never O
take O
guns O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

“ O
These O
things O
I O
had O
to O
say O
to O
her O
, O
and O
they O
worked O

” O
Bossi B-PER
explains O
, O
“ O
but O
I O
did O
n’t O
think O
of O
force O
action O

” O

This O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O

the O
life O
of O
the O
human B-ORG

What O
would O
happen O

Bossi B-PER

the O

In O

Ulivo B-ORG
marries O

full O
the O
words O

Napolitano B-PER
: O

This O

the O
most O
important O
part O

But O
, O
digging O
a O
little O
, O
some O
difference O
emerges O
in O
the O
majority O

The O
radical O
left O
insists O
on O
keeping O
the O
door O
closed O
not O
only O
to O
dialogue O

but O
also O
to O
the O
same O
possibility O

The O

sufficiently O
clear O
: O

“ O
It O

impossible O
to O

this O
way O

Fassino B-PER

the O
need O

In O
the O

Senator O

“ O

against O
the O

« O

. O

The O
tension O
has O
risen O
and O
some O
have O
asked O
the O
minister O
’s O
escort O
not O
to O
endanger O
the O
safety O
of O
him O
and O
his O
family O
. O

But O
Letizia B-PER
Moratti I-PER
did O
not O
give O
up O
. O

He O
took O
part O
in O
the O
course O
for O
about O
200 O
meters O
, O
then O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
course B-LOC
Vittorio I-LOC
Emanuele I-LOC
left O
the O
demonstration O
, O
still O
among O
the O
protests O
. O

The O
minister O
explained O
, O
however O
, O
that O
she O
had O
" O
not O
abandoned O
the O
procession O
" O
, O
but O
that O
she O
had O
come O
to O
accompany O
the O
father O
and O
that O
it O
was O
already O
planned O
that O
in O
view O
of O
the O
Duomo O
would O
end O
her O
participation O
. O

The O
protest O
against O
Letizia B-PER
Moratti I-PER
was O
stigmatized O
almost O
unanimously O
. O

“ O
Those O
who O
are O
present O

n’t O

to O
pay O

they O
recognize O
the O

I O
totally O
disagree O

This O
is O
the O
feast O
of O
unity O
, O
not O
of O
division O
, O
” O
Prodi B-PER
said O
. O

And O
expressions O
of O
solidarity O
have O
come O
to O
Moratti B-PER
from O
Ferrante B-PER
, O
Veltroni B-PER
, O
Albertini B-PER
, O
Formigoni B-PER
and O
from O
so O
many O
representatives O
of O
both O
the O
center O

the O
center O

right O
. O

There O
were O
also O
two O
Israeli O
flags O
burned O
by O
Israeli O
soldiers O
. O

The O
first O
episode O
occurred O
on O
Arquà B-LOC
street I-LOC
where O
a O
few O
dozen O
“ O
hard O
” O
at O
some O
point O
stumbled O
and O
set O
fire O
to O
an O
Israeli O
flag O
. O

The O
scene O
repeated O
later O
when O
, O
in O
the O
course B-LOC
of I-LOC
Venice I-LOC
, O
the O
autonomous O
people O
pulled O
out O
another O
Israeli O
flag O
to O
burn O
it O
. O

It B-PER
’s O
a O
good B-LOC
idea I-LOC
to O
be O
able O
to O
find O
a O
place O
where O
you O
’re O
going O
to O
be O
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
all O
regions O
of O
Italy B-LOC
, O
those O
of O
the O
North O
and O
those O
of O
the O
South O
, O
are O
bound O
by O
a O
pact O
of O
national O
solidarity O
and O
that O
it O
is O
a O
duty O
of O
the O
central O
state O
to O
help O
the O
least O
favoured O
regions O
of O
the O
South O
, O
especially O
to O
realize O
the O
infrastructure O
. O

Carlo B-PER
Azeglio I-PER
Ciampi I-PER
wanted O
to O
reiterate O
this O
to O
Crotone B-LOC
, O
with O
a O
discourse O
of O
institutional O
pedagogy O
that O
contains O
strong O
references O
to O
the O
duties O
of O
Southern O
citizens O
and O
the O
spirit O
of O
responsibility O
that O
must O
inspire O
their O
administrators O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
drug O
on O
the O
body O
and O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
drug O
is O
properly O
treated O
. O

To O
the O
young O
Ciampi B-PER
he O
asked O
essentially O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
two O
things O
: O

The O
“ O
good O
fortune O
” O
of O
finally O
living O
in O
a O
Europe B-LOC
of O
peace O
and O
the O
need O
to O
be O
artists O
of O
further O
progress O
. O

Because O
, O
he O
told O
them O
, O
the O
future O
will O
be O
what O
you O
will O
know O
how O
to O
build O
. O

Without O
ever O
quoting O
the O
word O
federalism O
, O
Ciampi B-PER
stated O
: O

“ O
The O
united O
Italy B-LOC
has O
the O
duty O
to O
pay O
special O
attention O
to O
the O
less O
developed O
regions O
because O
the O
country O
is O
one O
and O
its O
problems O
are O
problems O
of O
all O
, O
to O
be O
solved O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
all O
. O

This O
, O
however O
, O
“ O
does O
not O
mean O
neglecting O
the O
more O
advanced O
regions O
, O
which O
need O
to O
be O
stimulated O
and O
supported O
in O
order O
to O
remain O
competitive O
globally O
. O
” O

“ O
Italians B-LOC
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
are O
one O
of O
them O
. O

Its O
problems O
, O
although O
different O
in O
various O
areas O
, O
are O
problems O
of O
all O
and O
it O
is O
advantageous O
for O
all O
to O
solve O
each O
of O
them O
. O
” O

It O
is O
therefore O
fair O
for O
the O
South O
to O
rely O
on O
the O
richer O
North O

it O

this O

“ O
The O

was O
a O
year O
of O
psychological O
setting O
in O
the O
difficult O
transition O
from O
regional O

football O

This O
second O

is O
completely O

I O
expected O

a O

the O
Rovereto B-ORG

going O
through O
a O
delicate O
moment O

Mr. O
Enzo B-PER

what O
is O
the O
cause O
of O
this O
empty O
passage O
? O

“ O
With O
the O
Comano B-ORG
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
month O
, O
Giovanazzi B-PER
and O
Bortoli B-PER
came O
back O
, O
and O
Manica B-PER
is O
only O
right O
now O
. O

This O
also O
affects O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
team O
. O

However O
, O
we O
had O
to O
win O
with O
San B-ORG
Giorgio I-ORG
and O
instead O
we O
lost O
, O
against O
Stegona B-ORG
we O
were O
winning O
and O
we O
were O
hit O
. O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
year O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
we O
were O
able O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O

. O

I O
chose O
to O
be O
able O
to O
play O
without O
Cristoforetti B-PER
in O
the O
gate O
to O
be O
able O
to O
square O
the O

in O
the O
field O
, O
with O
9 O
experienced O
players O
in O
the O
category O
and O
two O
" O
under O
" O
. O

After O
three O
years O
of O
playing O
this O
group O
together O
, O
how O
does O
this O
impasse O
explain O
? O

“ O
I O
do O
n’t O
see O
big O
crises O
, O
we O
’ve O
played O
a O
few O
games O
lately O
, O
but O
these O
are O
things O
that O
happen O
in O
football O

I O
do O
n’t O
want O
some O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
seeing O
the O
return O
of O
Garniga B-PER
and O
having O
lost O
only O
Sceffer B-PER
, O
who O
was O
an O
important O
player O
for O
us O
, O
to O
think O
that O
we O
were O
a O
high O
- O
ranking O
team O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this B-PER
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
diet O
. O

It O
is O
time O
for O
the O
most O
experienced O
players O
, O
even O
if O
the O
oldest O
players O
are O
25 O
years O
old O
, O
to O
take O
on O
their O
responsibilities O
. O

This O
year O
we O
are O
also O
training O
more O
intensely O
than O
last O
championship O
, O
the O
training O
methods O
and O
the O
coach O
are O
always O
the O
same O
. O

Now O
we O
finally O
recovered O
Matté B-PER
, O
who O
can O
give O
quality O
on O
the O
bands O
and O
more O
choice O
to O
the O
center O
. O
” O

In O
the O
light O
of O
the O
many O
goals O
earned O
recently O
, O
will O
he O
insist O
with O
the O
defense O
at O
three O
or O
will O
he O
be O
more O
covered O
? O

" O
The O
defensive O
module O
does O
not O
focus O
on O
anything O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
earn O
too O
many O
networks O
, O
at O
least O
in O
the O
last O
matches O
, O
arises O
exclusively O
from O
individual O
mistakes O
, O
many O
goals O
honestly O
we O
made O
them O
ourselves O
, O
with O
large O
gifts O
to O
the O
opponents O
, O
not O
respecting O
deliveries O
and O
movements O
. O
" O

This O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
world O
. O

“ O
Unfortunately O
, O
not O
by O
his O
fault O
, O
he O
skipped O
all O
pre O

championship O
preparation O
for O
health O
problems O

When O
he O
played O
against O
San B-ORG
Giorgio I-ORG
he O
played O
pretty O
well O
but O
then O
in O
Stegona B-LOC
he O
did O
not O
confirm O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
, O
with O
the O
return O
of O
Bortoli B-PER
and O
Garniga B-PER
, O
with O
Giovanazzi B-PER
in O
support O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
make O
Giuliani B-PER
play O
too O
but O
I O
always O
keep O
it O
in O
mind O

Will O
he O
ask O
the O
company O
to O
return O
to O
the O
market O
to O
strengthen O
the O
rose O
? O

“ O
No O
, O
the O
company O
made O
a O
clear O
choice O
, O
shared O
by O
me O

We O
will O
not O
go O
to O
the O

given O
the O
response O
of O
a O

after O
winning O

absolutely O

up O

No O
one O
went O

What O
is O
missing O
is O
a O
great O
victory O
against O
a O
great O
opponent O
. O

With O
three O
more O
points O

we O
’d O
go O
up O

a O
more O

position O

and O
when O
those O

who O
can O

the O

convinced O

stop O

after O
her O
knee O

“ O
I O

the O

“ O
it O

ugly O

The O
medical O

explained O
to O
me O
that O

I O

Luca B-PER
Mazzanti I-PER
is O
so O
pleased O
with O
this O
success O
that O
he O
no O
longer O
feels O
neither O
the O
fatigue O
, O
nor O
the O
cold O
, O
nor O
the O
rain O
that O
is O
drawing O
his O
face O
. O

He O
explains O
it O
this O
way O
: O

“ O
In O
the O
final O
I O
realized O
that O
Cunego B-PER
, O
who O
had O
been O
working O
the O
team O
all O
day O
long O
, O
was O
no O
longer O
so O
brilliant O
. O

He O
, O
in O
the O
final O
climb O
, O
had O
always O
closed O
in O
first O
person O
all O
the O
shots O
of O
my O
companion O
Emanuele B-PER
Sella I-PER
and O
therefore O
seemed O
to O
me O
less O
reactive O
than O
usual O
. O

So O
I O
waited O
for O
the O
last O
blow O
of O
Sella B-PER
, O
the O
last O
closure O
of O
the O
Veronese O
, O
to O
start O
my O
turn O
in O
counterfoot O
. O

We O
were O
no O
more O
than O
300 O
meters O
from O
the O
arrival O
and O
I O
gave O
everything O
I O
had O
, O
even O
because O
if O
I O
did O
n’t O
take O
advantage O
of O
this O
opportunity O
Cunego B-PER
in O
an O
arrival O
so O
I O
do O
n’t O
beat O
him O
anymore O
. O
” O

You O
have O
done O
the O
good O
and O
the O
bad O
time O

You O

Perez B-PER

... O

“ O
To O
be O
honest O
, O
we O
only O
saw O
ourselves O
in O
the O
final O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
stage O
we O
let O
the O
Lampre B-ORG
work O
, O
also O
because O
in O
this O
Tour O
it O
is O
definitely O
the O
team O
to O
beat O

” O

You O
won O
the O
toughest O
stage O
, O
now O
the O
Tour O
is O
all O
down O
... O

and O
piano O

I O
won O
here O
and O
that O
makes O
me O
happy O
, O
but O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Tour O
there O
are O
still O
three O
stages O
and O
so O
anything O
can O
happen O
again O
. O

Cunego B-PER
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
is O
only O
at O
6 O

, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
before O

At O

It O

the O

half O

the O
European O

Then O
the O

Busetti B-PER
discovered O
that O
he O
was O
not O
graduated O

Despite O
this O
, O
he B-PER
signed O
up O
as O
an O

At O
one O
time O
he O
testified O
in O

But O
one O
thing O
is O
certain O
: O

The O
municipal O
group O
of O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
intends O
to O
do O
the O
devil O
to O
four O
to O
protest O
against O
the O
decision O
of O

to O

from O
next O
November O
1st O
to O
March O
31st O

The O
blue O

opposed O
because O
they O
consider O
it O
a O
useless O
, O
meaningless O
measure O

They O
argue O
that O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
costs O
and O
returns O
it O
is O
an O
operation O
that O
is O
not O

This O
would O
create O
enormous O
disadvantages O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
minimal O
benefit O
for O

. O

One O
of O
the O
ideas O
that O
the O
six O
municipal O

of O
Forza B-ORG

are O
studying O
is O
to O
organize O
a O
kind O
of O

when O
the O
plan O
of O

be O

For O
the O
next O

the O

in O
mind O
to O
organize O
a O
press O
conference O
and O
present O
the O
various O
initiatives O
on O
the O
subject O
. O

But O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
make O
the O
citizens O
understand O
how O
a O
party O
that O
has O
long O
fought O
against O
the O
incinerator O
, O
even O
supporting O
its O
environmental O
dangers O
, O
suddenly O
changes O

Unless O

no O

” O

The O
carabiner O
is O
Pugliese O
of O
origin O
, O
but O
has O
served O
in O
the O
province B-LOC
for O
many O
years O
now O
. O

His O
problems O
began O
in O
July O
last O
year O
: O

“ O
In O
June O
I O
separated O
from O
my O
ex O
- O
wife O
and O
met O
my O
current O
partner O
. O

The O
trouble O
began O
in O
July O
. O

A O
former O
flame O
of O
my O
companion O
who O
has O
a O
bar O
in O
Cles B-LOC
began O
to O
threaten O
me O
to O
get O
me O
transferred O
. O

He O
said O
he O
has O
knowledge O
in O
the O
Weapon B-ORG
and O
that O
he O
would O
have O
me O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
. O

He O
also O
threatened O
me O
and O
therefore O
there O
is O
a O
procedure O
against O
him O
before O
the O
Peace O
Judge O
of O
Cles B-LOC
. O

This O
person O
was O
also O
allowed O
to O
call O
my O
ex O
- O
wife O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
I O
had O
put O
up O
with O
a O
prejudiced O
ex O
- O
girlfriend O
. O

I O
did O
not O
give O
it O
too O
much O
weight O
, O
but O
then O
in O
November O
I O
received O
the O
notification O
from O
the O
Regional O
Command O
that O
the O
transfer O
procedure O
had O
been O
initiated O
. O

This O
news O
surprised O
and O
saddened O
me O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
explanations O
and O
I O
was O
answered O
that O
there O
was O
an O
anonymous O
exposition O
reporting O
my O
relationship O
with O
my O
current O
partner O
. O

The O
transfer O
was O
justified O
with O
the O
protection O
of O
my O
integrity O
. O

As O
if O
my O
ex O
- O
boyfriend O
could O
hurt O
me O
. O

I O
explained O
that O
he O
is O
in O
jail O
, O
around O
Italy B-LOC
, O
and O
he O
has O
no O
intention O
of O
hurting O
me O
. O

What O
interests O
him O
is O
that O
his O
ex O
and O
the O
two O
children O
he O
has O
had O
from O
her O
are O
well O
. O

And O
they O
are O
well O
with O
me O
. O
” O

This O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
the O
human O
being O
. O

The O
carabiniers O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
appeal O
the O
measure O
through O
lawyer O
Claudio B-PER
Tasin I-PER
. O

In O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
it O
has O
been O
discussed O
before O
the O
Tar B-ORG
of I-ORG
Trento I-ORG
his O
request O
for O
a O
suspension O
. O

The O
first O
results O
are O
expected O
for O
today O
. O

However O
, O
the O
carabiner O
is O
convinced O
that O
his O
safety O
is O
not O
the O
real O
reason O
for O
the O
transfer O
: O

“ O
They O
say O
that O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
they O
are O
in O
danger O
, O
but O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
if O
it O
were O
true O
, O
would O
also O
apply O
to O
the O
Alto B-LOC
Adige I-LOC
. O

If O
anyone O
wants O
to O
hurt O
me O
, O
they O
can O
do O
it O
to O
Lavis B-LOC
like O
San B-LOC
Candido I-LOC
. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
Weapon B-ORG
wants O
to O
boycott O
my O
love O
story O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
why O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
thousand O
times O
to O
understand O
it O
, O
but O
I O
failed O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
know O
if O
my O
relationship O
is O
not O
well O
seen O
because O
my O
former O
partner O
was O
a O
prejudiced O
partner O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
they O
were O
not O
married O
. O

They O
have O
no O
legal O
relationship O
. O

What O
hurts O
me O
most O
is O
that O
Arma B-ORG
, O
which O
for O
me O
represents O
a O
lot O
, O
listens O
more O
to O
an O
anonymous O
exhibition O
than O
to O
my O
reasons O
and O
my O
explanations O
. O

They O
want O
to O
stop O
my O
love O
story O
, O
but O
they O
wo O
n’t O
. O

I O
have O
always O
behaved O
well O
and O
have O
not O
violated O
any O
rules O
. O

The O
behavior O
is O
mirrored O
. O

My O
partner O
also O
has O
no O
criminal O
history O
and O
has O
never O
been O
involved O
in O
matters O
relating O
to O
her O
ex O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
can O
not O
really O
explain O
this O
complacency O
towards O
us O
. O

But O
I O
will O
not O
give O
up O

It O
is O
unclear O
if O
they O
ate O
the O
cake O
knowing O
it O
was O
reinforced O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O

He O

The O
texts O
called O

A O
work O
that O
people O
have O
been O
asking O
for O
20 O
years O
, O
if O
not O
even O
30 O
years O
, O
and O
that O
over O
time O
has O
become O
more O

more O
urgent O

restore O

Today O
, O
to O
see O
it O
from O

that O
fracture O
seems O
even O
more O
abissal O

Deep O
as O
the O
dozen O

over O
meters O
of O
excavation O
that O
the O
Collini B-ORG

has O
made O
to O

The O

be O
over O
600 O
meters O
long O
, O
with O
entrance O
and O
exit O
loops O
and O
four O

. O

Compared O
to O
the O
auction O
base O
, O
which O
was O
set O
at O
about O
20 O
million O
, O
the O
final O
expenditure O
should O
be O
about O
30 O
million O
, O
due O
to O
the O
need O
to O
carry O
out O
“ O
unpredictable O
and O
urgent O
works O
” O
. O

“ O
But O
I O
, O
” O
says O
the O
president O
of O
the O
district B-LOC
, O
Paolo B-PER
Biasioli I-PER
, O
“ O
have O
heard O
of O
64 O
billion O
of O
the O
old O
liras O

” O

That O
would O
mean O
33 O
million O
and O
broken O
euros O
. O

The O
work O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
completed O
in O
2005 O
, O
“ O
but O
the O
unexpected O
– O
continues O
the O
president O
– O
will O
delay O
. O

As O
a O
district B-LOC
we O
are O
considering O
the O
possibility O
of O
creating O
over O
the O
gallery O
a O
basement O

, O
almost O
a O
kind O
of O
reward O
for O
the O
country O
for O
having O
endured O
the O
inconveniences O
created O
by O
the O
site O

Because O
the O
unnecessary O
people O
deny O
it O
, O
although O
aware O
that O
the O
tunnel O
is O
crucial O
for O
the O
country O

survival O
, O
it O
has O
its O
pockets O
full O
of O
work O

in O

to O
that O
the O

In O
its O

which O
borders O
with O

, O

were O
placed O

check O
the O
stability O
of O
the O
soil O

In O
fact O
, O
some O
cracks O
in O
the O
building O
caused O
it O

One O
of O
them O
is O
Umberto B-PER

He O
destroyed O

three O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
discomfort O

“ O
I O
have O
to O
admit O

the O

also O
hurt O

we O

what O
was O
around O

I O
called O
the O

complain O

they O
told O
me O
to O
be O
patient O

They O
said O
that O
under O

would O
restore O
the O

we O
are O

“ O
They O

have O
paid O

a O
misery O

it O

” O

What O
is O
left O
of O
it O
is O
not O
even O
more O
convenient O
to O
cultivate O

Instead O
of O
tennis O

a O

the O
problem O
is O
different O

My O

by O
RENZO B-PER
M. I-PER
GROSSELLI I-PER

The O
“ O
magnadóra O
” O
is O
not O
a O
way O
to O
relate O
to O
the O
local O
authorities O
of O
this O
provincial B-ORG
junta I-ORG
. O

It O
is O
an O
ancient O
tradition O
of O
Christian B-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
that O
can O
still O
find O
some O
reflection O
, O
both O
within O
the O
provincial O
machine O
and O
in O
certain O
environments O
of O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
the O
president O
Dellai B-PER
who O
relies O
on O
this O
type O
of O
administrative O
- O
political O
practice O
. O

However O
, O
more O
power O
should O
be O
given O
to O
the O
territorial O
area O
than O
to O
the O
provincial O
center O
. O

“ O
And O
my O
reform O
– O
says O
Ottorino B-PER
Bressanini I-PER
, O
Ds B-ORG
, O
adviser O
to O
reforms O
– O
goes O
exactly O
in O
this O
direction O
. O
” O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
century O
, O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
the O
people O
of O
the O
city O
were O
able O
to O
find O
a O
place O
in O
the O
city O
, O
where O
the O
people O
of O
the O
city O
were O
able O
to O
find O
a O
place O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Did O
you O
promise O
or O
not O
to O
lower O
the O
magnadora O
? O

No O
, O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
in O
this O
round O
of O
elections O
mayors O
come O
to O
the O
province B-LOC
with O
a O
hat O
in O
their O
hands O
. O

This O
has O
been O
a O
long O
tradition O
that O
Christian B-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
has O
cultivated O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
. O

And O
that O
, O
despite O
the O
passage O
of O
time O
, O
it O
has O
remained O
almost O
a O
matter O
of O
system O
. O

That O
risks O
continuing O
until O
the O
center O
of O
power O
is O
single O
. O

Too O
much O
power O
in O
the O
country B-LOC
? O

In O
the O
province B-LOC
of O
course O
. O

I’t O
tell O
the O
council B-LOC
’s O
president O
. O

I O
think O
that O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
of O
clientelare O
does O
very O
little O
. O

He O
constitutes O
a O
soul O
of O
the O
DC B-ORG
that O
has O
moved O
away O
from O
that O
system O
. O

There O
are O
other O
souls O
, O
in O
that O
party O
and O
in O
the O
provincial O
administration O
, O
who O
tend O
to O
keep O
that O
tradition O
alive O
. O

However O
, O
if O
I O
concentrate O
power O
in O
a O
single O
center O
, O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
clientele O
, O
the O
pressure O
on O
the O
lower O
levels O
of O
administration O
, O
the O
conditioning O
are O
born O
. O

Democracy O
is O
about O
bringing O
power O
close O
to O
the O
citizen O
, O
giving O
him O
more O
opportunities O
to O
manage O
it O
and O
condition O
it O
, O
directing O
it O
. O

Bressanini B-PER
, O
she O
studied O
and O
proposed O
an O
institutional O
reform O
that O
some O
effect O
it O
could O
produce O
on O
this O
system O
. O

The O
reform O
is O
meant O
to O
mean O
this O
: O

To O
bring O
the O
centre O
of O
real O
power O
closer O
to O
citizenship O
, O
avoiding O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
the O
system O
of O
blackmail O
and O
retaliation O
. O

But O
to O
do O
so O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
that O
the O
financial O
flows O
, O
many O
financial O
flows O
, O
from O
the O
Province B-LOC
reach O
the O
territorial O
spheres O
“ O
by O
law O
” O
, O
without O
political O
mediation O
. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
the O
reform O
provides O
, O
in O
a O
much O
more O
important O
and O
meaningful O
way O
than O
it O
does O
now O
. O

I O
realize O
that O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
territories O
, O
areas O
, O
methods O
of O
election O
of O
certain O
bodies O
. O

But O
the O
important O
discourse O
behind O
us O
is O
that O
of O
the O
exercise O
of O
power O
, O
which O
goes O
to O
the O
territories O
. O

The O
micro O
- O
dimensions O
of O
the O
communes O
do O
not O
give O
them O
the O
possibility O
of O
actually O
exercising O
power O
. O

Instead O
, O
with O
the O
territorial O
areas O
that O
my O
reform O
envisages O
, O
there O
will O
be O
real O
transitions O
of O
power O
from O
what O
is O
now O
the O
absolute O
centrality O
of O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

Does O
your O
reform O
take O
into O
account O
and O
therefore O
establish O
different O
financial O
competences O
? O

of O
course O
. O

In O
article O
7 O
there O
is O
a O
very O
detailed O
list O
, O
which O
establishes O
what O
are O
the O
competences O
that O
remain O
to O
the O
Province B-LOC
and O
those O
that O
instead O
pass O
to O
the O
communities O
of O
the O
valley O
. O

The O
most O
relevant O
are O
those O
of O
the O
territorial O
organization O
of O
urban O
planning O
( O
a O
second O
- O
degree O
power O
, O
of O
course O
, O
which O
must O
comply O
with O
the O
guidelines O
defined O
in O
the O
province O
) O
. O

But O
then O
also O
the O
territorial O
organization O
of O
the O
planning O
of O
the O
development O
of O
a O
community O
. O

Each O
community O
will O
have O
to O
question O
and O
decide O
where O
it O
wants O
to O
go O
and O
how O
to O
get O
there O
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
province B-LOC
that O
should O
do O
it O
. O

The O
government B-LOC
only O
has O
to O
provide O
funding O
. O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
century O
, O
the O
world O
’s O
most O
famous O
cities O
were O
located O
in O
the O
southern O
part O
of O
the O
country O
, O
in O
the O
southern O
part O
of O
the O
country O
, O
in O
the O
southern O
part O
of O
the O
country O
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
know O
about O
this O
shield O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
, O
like O
in O
the O
past O
, O
many O
thirty O
citizens O
voted O
differently O
for O
politics O
, O
than O
in O
administrative O
elections O
. O

The O
Left O
, O
for O
example O
, O
has O
always O
received O
more O
votes O
in O
national O
elections O
, O
because O
it O
was O
an O
ideal O
vote O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
in O
the O
world O
, O
there O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
people O
who O
want O
to O
get O
to O
know O
what O
they O
want O
to O
do O
. O

It O
is O
a O
little O
the O
speech O
of O
that O
mayor O
of O
Fai B-LOC
who O
is O
said O
to O
be O
center O
- O
right O
but O
who O
has O
signed O
up O
to O
Margherita B-ORG
to O
get O
alleged O
advantages O
in O
relations O
with O
the O
Province B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
a O
little O
sad O
that O
the O
mayor O
, O
his O
mentality O
is O
already O
clientelary O
in O
the O
beginning O
. O

I O
think O
he O
is O
more O
guilty O
than O
anyone O
who O
really O
asks O
him O
something O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
a O
very O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life B-LOC
and O
that O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
. O

It O
may O
be O
that O
Margherita B-ORG
has O
stimulated O
such O
behaviors O
over O
the O
years O
. O

But O
the O
mammoths O
no O
longer O
exist O
, O
not O
even O
on O
the O
left O
. O

What O
I O
mean O
is O
that O
the O
attitude O
of O
selling O
itself O
to O
power O
, O
the O
feeling O
of O
not O
being O
citizens O
with O
rights O
but O
dependent O
on O

Will O
the O
institutional O
reform O
you O
have O
proposed O
be O
able O
to O
break O
this O
tradition O
? O

It O
provides O
territories O
with O
greater O
tools O
of O
autonomy O
, O
but O
also O
greater O
responsibilities O
for O
local O
administrators O

In O
the O
end O

however O
, O
my O
aspiration O
is O
to O
increase O
people O

participation O
in O
public O
affairs O
. O

Expanding O
the O
everyday O
relationship O
of O
the O
citizen O
with O
power O
, O
today O
too O
scarce O
. O

We O
do O
not O
want O
to O
create O
a O
new O
class O
of O
administrators O
but O
to O
scatter O
power O
in O
society O

Is O
Lorenzo B-PER

a O
good O

Without O
him O

Even O
if O
he O
should O
not O
be O
condemned O

he O
should O

we O

it O

of O

to O
our O

For O
the O
little O
Jacopo B-PER
hospitalized O
in O
a O
room O
with O
older O
children O
, O
not O
equipped O
for O
his O
needs O
, O
and O
for O
those O
of O
his O
mother O
who O
has O
always O
been O
with O
him O
, O
there O
was O
no O
place O
in O
the O
breastfeeding O
section O

“ O
It O
was O
all O
full O
, O
” O
says O
Dr. O
Di B-PER
Palma I-PER
, O
“ O
the O
epidemic O
period O
has O
begun O
and O
, O
although O
hospitalizations O
are O
as O
short O
as O
possible O
, O
there O
are O
never O
enough O
places O
. O
” O

At O
the O
time O
the O
new O
pediatric O
palace O
of O
Santa B-ORG
Chiara I-ORG
represented O
a O
great O
innovation O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
neonatology O
with O
the O
nest O
had O
been O
brought O
on O
the O
same O
level O
as O
gynecology O
. O

The O
needs O
of O
the O
pediatric O
group O
, O
however O
, O
in O
recent O
years O
have O
changed O
completely O
: O

We O
hospitalized O
from O
three O
months O
to O
twenty O
years O
, O
even O
girls O
with O
anorexia O
nervosa O
, O
with O
chronic O
diseases O
– O
explains O
Di B-PER
Palma I-PER
. O

We O
do O
an O
absolute O
low O
number O
of O
hospitalizations O
, O
because O
they O
are O
around O
1200/1300 O
, O
but O
there O
are O
another O
1500/1700 O
children O
and O
boys O
held O
in O
observation O
even O
for O
36 O
hours O
. O

With O
this O
movement O
the O
programming O
of O
the O
24 O
places O
available O
is O
impossible O
, O
especially O
in O
this O
period O
of O
diffuse O
viral O
forms O
: O

It O
is O
a O
time O
of O
great O
work O
, O
with O
a O
quick O
and O
very O
pressing O
turn O
over O
. O

The O
department O
workers O
, O
however O
, O
put O
our O
hearts O
, O
and O
so O
the O
volunteers O
who O
are O
here O
to O
help O
: O

This O
is O
why O
they O
are O
resented O
for O
the O
feeling O
of O
abandonment O
described O
by O
this O
couple O
in O
the O
newspaper O
, O
and O
they O
are O
resented O
people O
who O
are O
also O
spending O
with O
emotions O
and O
not O
just O
with O
the O
time O
that O
is O
dedicated O

Jacopo B-PER
was O
in O
a O

teenage O
girl O

with O
different O

other O

if O
it O

says O
Di B-PER

– O

also O

we O

left O
in O
four O
by O

without O

one O

been O

In O

the O

had O
prepared O
the O

us O
, O
booking O
our O
overnight O

local O

a O
help O
that O
- O
when O
traveling O
to O
those O
countries O
and O
that O
way O
- O
is O
very O
valuable O
. O

Everything O
went O
well O
: O

We O
were O
hosted O
in O
family O
, O
in O
contact O
with O
local O
realities O
, O
we O
lived O
with O
families O
and O
listened O
to O
their O
stories O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
so O
many O
countries O
already O
reconstructed O
but O
also O
so O
many O
needs O
and O
needs O
that O
do O
not O
yet O
find O
answers O
. O

And O
you O
feel O
everywhere O
the O
effort O
to O
return O
to O
normality O
, O
even O
if O
the O
wounds O
are O
still O
there O
and O
it O
will O
take O
time O
for O
them O
to O
recover O
. O

It O
was O
undoubtedly O
an O
experience O
that O
enriched O
us O
and O
left O
us O
precious O
memories O
. O

Among O
the O
material O
collected O
by O
Giovanna B-PER

there O
are O
surprising O
illustrations O
of O
places O

such O
as O
the O

a O
route O
in O

that O

along O
rivers O
and O
streams O
that O
intertwin O
and O
flow O
over O
the O
territory O

And O
it O
comes O
to O
wonder O
why O
so O
many O
of O
us O
feel O
at O
home O
in O
some O
unlikely O
and O
invented O
place O
like O
Sharm B-LOC

so O
now O
it O

called O

never O

put O
our O

from O

in O
these O
charming O
places O

rich O
in O

History O
that O
so O
often O
– O
and O
also O
recently O
– O
has O
painfully O
touched O
us O
closely O

Fortunately O
, O
there O
is O
always O
someone O
out O
of O
the O

The O
true O
discovery O
is O
not O

Rizzoli B-PER

even O
in O

“ O
President O
Dellai B-PER
could O
not O
fail O
to O
mention O
the O
issue O
of O
incineration O
, O
which O
is O
also O
at O
the O
center O
of O
attention O
, O
although O
more O
discreetly O
addressed O
by O
Archbishop O
Bressan B-PER
. O

It O
is O
almost O
a O
more O
delicate O
topic O
, O
politically O
heavier O
, O
with O
so O
little O
readiness O
to O
a O
real O
comparison O
. O

Even O
among O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
local O
Church B-ORG
, O
in O
fact O
, O
one O
has O
the O
courage O
to O
( O
re O
) O
speak O
about O
it O
; O

It O
would O
almost O
seem O
that O
it O
should O
remain O
a O
taboo O
even O
though O
many O
religious O
feel O
the O
need O
for O
greater O
coherence O
and O
presence O
on O
social O
issues O
on O
which O
the O
Catholic O
base O
is O
actually O
much O
more O
sensitive O
and O
vigilant O
than O
one O
thinks O
. O

In O
his O
speech O
, O
the O
President O
raised O
a O
number O
of O
challenges O
. O

He O
writes O
that O
“ O
rule O
means O
taking O
into O
account O
all O
positions O
, O
confronting O
all O
” O
, O
while O
continuing O
to O
reject O
that O
of O
a O
frank O
confrontation O
with O
the O
opponents O
of O
his O
project O
of O
the O
incinerator O
. O

It O
does O
not O
allow O
a O
single O
comparison O
– O
contradictory O
– O
even O
with O
those O
local O
communities O
that O
, O
precisely O
in O
these O
times O

demand O
it O
out O

Similarly O

and O
with O
the O

behavioral O

with O

punctuality O
any O
public O
administrator O

who O
dare O
to O

a O

point O
of O
skepticism O
towards O
the O
project O
of O
the O
incinerator O

It O
is O
not O
strange O
to O
him O
that O
having O
invited O
him O
here O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
speakers O
of O
proven O
skills O
, O
without O
having O
yet O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
go O
to O
a O
confrontation O
, O
sounds O
really O
like O
the O
paradox O
of O
the O
selfishness O
of O
Autonomy O
, O
even O
that O
of O
thought O
? O

For O
the O
President O
it O
is O
ethical O
to O
limit O
itself O
to O
“ O
re O
- O
taking O
” O
and O
silencing O
all O
those O
who O
raise O
doubts O

or O
speak O
a O
word O

about O
the O
validity O
of O
this O
choice O

In O
too O
many O

both O

colleagues O

they O
now O
know O
what O
is O
behind O
this O
ugly O
page O
of O

politics O

far O
beyond O
that O
sense O
of O
responsibility O
to O
which O
he O
is O
now O
increasingly O
tired O
to O
refer O
. O

The O
president O
of O
Dellai B-PER
still O
feels O
the O
need O
to O
“ O
have O
to O
reject O
without O
discussion O
” O
the O
criticism O
that O
he O
would O
not O
have O
chosen O
“ O
the O
way O
of O
the O
incinerator O
to O
do O
business O
” O
. O

He O
argues O
that O
“ O
it O
is O
not O
so O
and O
proves O
that O
the O
incinerator O
could O
be O
a O
third O
bigger O
than O
the O
initial O
predictions O
. O
” O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
even O
on O
this O
occasion O
it O
loses O
another O
opportunity O
to O
demonstrate O
long O
- O
sightedness O
, O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
Trentino B-LOC

preferring O
that O
conditional O

One O
example O

have O
already O
begun O
to O
document O
the O
most O

The O
novelty O
of O
the O
system O
is O
that O
it O
can O
perfectly O
and O
in O
a O
three O

way O
document O

“ O
In O

” O
explains O

“ O
the O

can O
completely O

“ O

also O

Garofano B-PER
added O

Among O
the O
advantages O

the O
precise O
review O
of O

The O
president O

on O

hand O
, O
is O
intended O
to O
hold O

already O
stated O
that O
he O
will O
re O

present O
the O
original O

because O
it O
responds O
to O
the O
need O
to O
clarify O
the O
legislative O
framework O
in O
which O
the O
hunt O
takes O
place O
, O
in O

light O
of O

of O
the O
Constitutional B-ORG

, O
adapting O

" O

In O

will O
come O
all O
three O
draft O
laws O

and O
the O
" O
radically O
modified O
" O

of O
the O

that O

restored O

“ O
But O
I O
hope O
that O
there O
is O
room O
for O
discussion O
, O
” O
Pinter B-PER
says O
, O
“ O
with O
some O
signals O
of O
less O
conflict O
between O
those O
who O
want O
too O
extensive O
use O
of O
venatory O
harvesting O
and O
those O
who O
are O
against O
hunting O
. O
” O

Three O
issues O
that O
Pinterest B-PER
hopes O
there O
may O
be O
a O
rethink O
: O

the O
observance O
of O
Sunday O
as O
a O
day O
of O
veneratory O
silence O
, O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
old O
system O
of O
the O
hunting O
of O
eggs O
from O
1 O
September O
, O
excluding O
the O
summer O
period O
, O
and O
the O
elimination O
of O
the O
15 O
days O
of O
August O
for O
the O
hunting O
of O
camels O
. O

“ O
Sunday O
as O
a O
day O
of O
veneratory O
silence O
is O
an O
old O
ball O
of O
mine O
ever O
, O
on O
holidays O
the O
mountains O
are O
more O
crowded O
and O
there O
are O
more O
people O
in O
the O
woods O
, O
” O
Pinter B-PER
explains O
. O

Secondly O
: O

The O
rule O
says O
that O
the O
days O
of O
hunting O
are O
three O
out O
of O
five O
, O
but O
at O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
hunter O
, O
which O
ultimately O
leads O
them O
to O
five O
; O

I O
said O
no O
, O
the O
days O
are O
actually O
three O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
have O
been O
told O
that O
in O
Alto B-LOC
Adige I-LOC
you O
hunt O
seven O
days O
out O
of O
seven O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
see O
why O
in O
Trentino B-LOC
you O
ca O
n’t O
do O
better O
. O

I O
start O
from O
the O
principle O
that O
, O
while O
remaining O
the O
venatory O
collection O
, O
in O
fewer O
days O
it O
is O
done O
better O
we O
are O
all O
, O
because O
there O
is O
a O
conjunctivity O
of O
presence O
that O
is O
not O
only O
a O
danger O
, O
but O
also O
a O
problem O
of O
tranquility O
for O
the O
fauna O
and O
for O
nature O
. O
" O

The O
third O
question O
posed O
by O
Pinter B-PER
, O
and O
removed O
from O
the O
amended O
text O
, O
is O
that O
concerning O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
old O
venatory O
calendar O
, O
with O
the O
collection O
of O
ungulates O
also O
allowed O
in O
the O
period O
from O
1 O
May O
to O
30 O
June O
. O

" O
It O
is O
clear O
that O
this O
was O
the O
main O
content O
of O
the O
law O
, O
" O
Pinter B-PER
continues O
, O
" O
but O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
extend O
the O
time O
to O
allow O
a O
well O
done O
withdrawal O
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
even O
some O
representatives O
of O
the O
hunters O
have O
expressed O
concern O
about O
this O
period O
that O
is O
the O
one O
in O
which O
there O
are O
in O
circulation O
the O
smaller O
puppies O
. O
” O

Pinter B-PER
’s O
amendment O
removed O
this O
possibility O
, O
reintroduced O
by O
national O
legislation O
and O
challenged O
by O
animalists O
. O

If O
you B-PER
are O
not O
aware O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
you B-PER
will O
be O
able O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
you O
are O
not O
aware O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
are O
aware O
of O
the O
situation B-ORG
. O

At O
this O
point O
the O
law O
has O
been O
rejected O
, O
but O
will O
go O
to O
the O
house O
with O
the O
amended O
text O
forcing O
the O
majority O
to O
resume O
with O
the O
amendments O
. O

“ O
I O
do O
not O
make O
illusions O
and O
do O
not O
pretend O
that O
from O
evening O
to O
morning O
the O
hunting O
disappears O
, O
” O
Pinter B-PER
concludes O
, O
“ O
but O
that O
some O
forms O
of O
disattention O
towards O
tourism O
and O
towards O
those O
who O
visit O
the O
forests O
are O
mitigated O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
possible O

This O
year O
, O
the O
municipality B-LOC
had O
to O
say O
53 O
no O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
boom O
of O
applications O
for O
enrollment O
in O
the O
summer O

. O

Places O
are O
exhausted O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
board B-ORG
decided O
that O
in O
the O
future O
the O
supply O
will O
be O
increased O
. O

From O
next O
year O
, O
we O
will O
try O
to O
activate O
two O
structures O
instead O
of O
one O
, O
to O
try O
to O
ensure O
the O
service O
to O
all O
those O
who O
will O
ask O
for O
it O
. O

The O
exit O
of O
graduations O
and O
the O
exclusion O
of O
a O
few O
dozen O
children O
had O
raised O
in O
recent O
days O
bump O
and O
controversy O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
a O
human O
being O

This O
year O
, O
in O
order O
to O
try O
to O
expand O

That O

“ O
In O
the O

I O
am O
not O
half O
of O

someone O
has O
said O
, O
” O
commented O
the O

. O

In O
August O
, O
the O
demand O
was O
significantly O
lower O
than O
the O
supply O
. O

The O
other O
complaint O
arose O
concerning O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
service O
, O
93 O
euros O
per O
week O
. O

This O
is O
significantly O
higher O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
130 O

spent O
on O
the O
attendance O
of O
a O
full O
regular O

“ O
But O
let O

” O
Pegoretti B-PER

“ O
that O

if O
we O

they O
risk O
coming O
down O

It O
is O
so O
on O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
Calypso B-LOC

“ O
I O
wonder O
where O

the O
coherence O

this O
party O
that O
shares O
the O
principle O
of O
stop O
building O
in O

then O
in O
Povo B-LOC

a O
negative O
opinion O
on O
the O
stripping O
of O
a O
craft O
area O
while O
in O
Argentario B-LOC
decides O
to O
realize O
a O
new O
one O

” O

He O
also O
considers O
incongruous O
the O
choice O
to O
attach O
to O
the O
private O
settlement O
public O
services O
that O
, O
given O
the O
necessary O
disbursements O
, O
will O
cost O
a O
lot O
of O
money O

just O
as O
the O

announces O
years O
of O
thin O
cows O

There O
is O
also O
an O
alternative O
available O
: O

" O
There O
are O
two O
building O
skeletons O
near O
the O
supermarket O
Poli O

twenty O

for O
disputes O
between O
the O

an O
expropriation O
would O
also O
solve O
the O
problem O
of O
those O
debris O
in O
the O
already O
built O
area O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
here O
we O
have O
started O
from O
the O
need O
of O
a O
private O
rather O
than O
from O
public O
needs O

Moreover O
, O
the O
company O
Leveghi B-ORG

not O

“ O
It O

the O

With O
these O
words O
, O
they O
tell O

Berlusconi B-PER
would O
have O
concluded O
the O
Council O

thus O
expressing O
his O
satisfaction O
for O
having O
successfully O
overcome O
the O
crumbling O
of O
the O
federal O
reform O

The O
result O
was O
reached O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
very O
quiet O
meeting O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
as O
learned O
, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
several O
moments O
of O
tension O
for O
verbal O
clashes O
between O
ministers O
. O

But O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
the O
revolution O
to O
warm O
the O
souls O
. O

The O
first O
discussion O
was O
about O
the O
ratification O
of O
the O
Treaty O
of O
Nice B-LOC
. O

The O
Minister O
for O
Reforms O
, O
Umberto B-PER
Bossi I-PER
, O
has O
expressed O
a O
clear O
opposition O
, O
calling O
this O
treaty O
“ O
antidemocratic O
” O
. O

Other O
ministers O
would O
have O
pointed O
out O
to O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Carroccio B-ORG
that O
the O
passage O
to O
the O
Chambers O
of O
a O
text O
so O
important O
to O
the O
European B-LOC
Union I-LOC
is O
“ O
an O
act O
due O
” O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product B-PER
is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product B-PER
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
Minister O
for O
Community O
Policies O
Rocco B-PER
Buttiglione I-PER
would O
have O
raised O
his O
voice O
strongly O
arguing O
that O
the O
Europeanist O
commitment O
is O
part O
of O
the O
government O
’s O
programme O
at O
least O
as O
much O
as O
the O
devolution O
. O

Berlusconi B-PER
would O
not O
have O
intervened O
in O
the O
discussion O
, O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
an O
intervention O
of O
Foreign O
Minister O
Renato B-PER
Ruggiero I-PER
to O
convince O
Bossi B-PER
to O
surrender O
. O

The O
second O
proposal O
that O
caused O
a O
lively O
debate O
was O
the O
draft O
constitutional O
reform O
advanced O
by O
Minister O
for O
Equal O
Opportunities O
Stefania B-PER
Prestigiacomo I-PER
, O
aimed O
at O
amending O
Article O
51 O
to O
promote O
the O
presence O
of O
women O
in O
electoral O
assemblies O
. O

Even O
in O
this O
case O
, O
he B-PER
would O
have O
protested O
vigorously O
. O

Bossi B-PER
would O
have O
pointed O
out O
that O
, O
since O
he O
is O
the O
minister O
for O
reforms O
, O
every O
proposed O
amendment O
to O
the O
Constitution O
must O
be O
submitted O
to O
his O
examination O
. O

“ O
I O
am O
the O
one O
who O
proposes O
reforms O
in O
this O
government O
– O
he O
would O
have O
asked O
irritated O
– O
is O
n’t O
it O
? O

“ O
.. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
League B-ORG
would O
have O
obtained O
more O
consent O
, O
making O
it O
necessary O
to O
examine O
the O
substance O
of O
the O
proposal O
. O

Many O
would O
have O
objected O
that O
talking O
about O
“ O
equal O
access O
” O
would O
reopen O
the O
old O
question O
of O
“ O
quotas O
” O
. O

If O
you O
start O
with O
women O
, O
it O
would O
be O
observed O
, O
you O
could O
then O
come O
to O
establish O
a O
number O
of O
seats O
to O
be O
reserved O
for O
linguistic O
minorities O
, O
ethnic O
minorities O
and O
other O
particular O
communities O
. O

From O
here O
the O
solution O
to O
introduce O
the O
less O
compelling O
expression O
of O
“ O
equal O
opportunities O
” O
in O
the O
rewrite O
of O
Article O
51 O
. O

The O
devolution O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
strong O
dish O
of O
the O
day O
, O
would O
have O
been O
the O
point O
with O
the O
smallest O
friction O
. O

With O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
framework O
law O
to O
accompany O
the O
constitutional O
reform O
, O
an O
amendment O
to O
the O
text O
of O
the O
reform O
made O
by O
Bossi B-PER
himself O
would O
be O
welcomed O
, O
in O
which O
it O
is O
stated O
that O
the O
devolution O
must O
have O
as O
limits O
the O
guarantee O
of O
constitutional O
rights O
and O
duties O
and O
constitutional O
laws O
. O

There O
would O
be O
a O
step O
- O
by O
- O
step O
route O
: O

It O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
change O
Article O
117 O
, O
introducing O
the O
exclusive O
competence O
of O
the O
Regions O
on O
school O
, O
health O
and O
local O
safety O
. O

In O
a O
second O
phase O
, O
it O
will O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
revision O
of O
Article O
119 O
, O
which O
regulates O
the O
transfers O
of O
resources O

and O
the O
new O

on O
the O

for O
the O
holding O
of O
the O

On O
the O

therefore O
, O
the O
Council B-ORG

reached O
a O
“ O
full O
political O

on O

the O

be O

by O
the O

A O

was O

by O
Umberto B-PER
Bossi I-PER
at O
the O
end O

The O

“ O

for O
an O

In O

Bossi B-PER
also O
explained O
that O

As O
for O
the O

of O
Gianfranco B-PER

“ O

the O

Maintaining O

six O
months O

a O

– O
as O
you O

it O

is O
a O
difficult O
undertaking O

The O
Americans O
, O
despite O
everything O

are O
not O
seen O
as O
a O
force O

of O

Creating O
a O

difficult O

the O

inherit O
various O

which O
will O
make O
it O
difficult O

This O
adds O
to O
the O
economic O

If O
the O
U.S. O

the O
current O
difficulties O
of O

it O
will O
be O
an O
argument O
that O
the O

be O

the O

this O
“ O

that O
the O

It O

So O
far O

however O

there O
are O

We O
have O
a O
victorious O

the O

the O
Americans O

The O
multilateralist O
line O
( O
Colin B-PER
Powell I-PER

within O
the O
Bush B-PER

is O
a O
loser O
to O
Paul B-PER
Wolfowitz I-PER

unilateralism O

National O
Security O
Advisor O
Condoleeza B-PER
Rice I-PER
has O

be O
excluded O

the O

In O
short O
, O
the O
line O
that O
“ O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
United B-LOC

come O
before O
anything O
else O
” O
appears O
to O
be O
winning O
on O
every O

Now O
we O
talk O
about O
continuing O
the O
triumphant O
advance O
in O
Syria B-LOC
, O
Iran B-LOC
, O
and O
Korea B-LOC

“ O
We O
are O
careful O
. O

The O
case O
of O
Iraq B-LOC
was O
easy O
to O
experiment O
with O
the O
new O
policy O
. O

Saddam B-PER
was O
a O
dictator O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
convince O
the O
American O
public O
that O
this O
was O
a O
danger O
that O
had O
to O
be O
eliminated O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
same O
American O
leaders O
thought O
they O
had O
more O
allies O
by O
their O
side O
. O

If O
now O
the O
“ O
new O
policy O
” O
is O
extended O
to O
Syria B-LOC
, O
not O
even O
Blair B-PER
is O
there O
. O

It O
will O
not O
be O
so O
easy O
to O
extend O
the O
war O
to O
other O
countries O
. O

And O
then O
? O

If O
America B-LOC
suffers O
another O
act O
of O
terrorism O
, O
how O
will O
public O
opinion O
react O
? O

Bush B-PER
has O
said O
: O

Saddam B-PER
Hussein O
and O
terrorism O
. O

Per O
at O
that O
point O
it O
can O
trigger O
the O
reflection O
that O
has O
n’t O
been O
there O
after O
September O
11 O
. O

American O
public O
opinion O
at O
that O
point O
will O
wonder O
whether O
weapons O
are O
exactly O
the O
most O
suitable O
means O
for O
international O
pacification O
. O

In O
America B-LOC
there O
is O
a O
strong O
, O
now O
silent O
minority O
who O
may O
react O
to O
the O
elections O
differently O
from O
what O
the O
Bush B-PER
administration O
expects O
. O

Let O
us O
remember O
that O
the O
election O
of O
the O
president O
took O
place O
in O
a O
country O
split O
in O
half O
, O
which O
has O
within O
itself O
strong O
opposition O
to O
war O
( O
Noam B-PER
Chomsky I-PER
) O
, O
which O
has O
seen O
Americans O
to O
the O
last O
favor O
a O
second O
UN B-ORG
resolution O
. O
” O

But O
Iraq B-LOC
has O
shown O
that O
, O
overall O
, O
making O
a O
war O
for O
the O
world O
’s O
most O
powerful O
army O
is O
an O
easy O
and O
quick O
thing O
. O

Within O
a O
month O
, O
they O
were O
able O
to O
occupy O
Saddam B-PER
’s O
palaces O
. O

Among O
the O
300,000 O
men O
employed O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
just O
a O
handful O
, O
and O
mostly O
by O
“ O
friend O
fire O
” O
. O

Could O
n’t O
this O
cause O
many O
to O
change O
their O
minds O
and O
believe O
that O
war O
could O
become O
the O
ordinary O
means O
of O
American O
foreign O
policy O
? O

Without O
a O
doubt O
in O
prominent O
figures O
like O
Rumsfeld B-PER
and O
Wolfowitz B-PER
( O
Pentagon O
number O
one O
and O
number O
two O
, O
n.d.r O
. O
) O
there O
has O
always O
been O
the O
idea O
that O
war O
was O
a O
message O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
Syria B-LOC
and O
Iraq B-LOC
. O

How O
to O
say O
: O

Be O
careful O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n’t O
do O
the O
good O
things O
then O
we O
’ll O
come O
to O
you O
. O

But O
the O
reality O
is O
not O
so O
simple O
. O

In O
the O
war O
, O
the O
Americans O
did O
well O
. O

It O
is O
all O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
however O
, O
if O
they O
will O
be O
the O
same O
in O
the O
management O
of O
peace O
keeping O
and O
the O
nation O
building O
. O

We O
must O
remember O
that O
Iraq B-LOC
is O
a O
country O
to O
be O
rebuilt O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
predict O
that O
, O
after O
the O
first O
enthusiasm O
, O
after O
a O
few O
months O
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
will O
realize O
that O
it O
will O
fail O
to O
control O
the O
country O
, O
to O
rebuild O
it O
, O
to O
implant O
a O
democratic O
government O
there O
. O

And O
this O
will O
force O
us O
to O
rethink O
the O
role O
of O
international O
bodies O
, O
of O
Europe B-LOC
, O
of O
multilateral O
alliances O
, O
of O
the O
unrelenting O
use O
of O

” O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
relations O
between O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC

Europe B-LOC
are O
frozen O
. O

The O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
no O
longer O
has O
a O

NATO B-ORG

in O

The O
possibility O

alliances O
has O
disappeared O

To O
rebuild O
this O
network O
of O
relationships O

will O
not O
really O
be O
a O
child O

game O
. O

For O
united O
Europe B-LOC
it O
is O
an O
unprecedented O
massacre O

“ O
If O
the O
United B-LOC

continues O
to O
think O
of O
doing O
its O

without O
the O
UN B-ORG

the O
contrary O

a O
reconciliation O

The O
eight O
European O

find O
themselves O
unable O
to O
maintain O
an O
uncritical O
position O

would O
be O
in O
trouble O

If O
then O
the O
post O
- O
war O
management O
– O
as O
analysts O
predict O
– O
proves O
to O
be O
rough O

it O
would O
be O
the O
United B-LOC

itself O

appear O

ask O

by O

even O
of O
the O
post O

period O
, O
then O
Europe B-LOC
would O
indeed O
be O
heavily O
weakened O

and O
the O
international O
institutions O
at O
the O
forefront O

This O
is O
the O
least O
likely O
scenario O
. O
” O

The O
fact O
remains O
that O
the O
United B-LOC

has O
demonstrated O
on O
the O
field O
that O
it O
is O
a O
military O
force O

at O

This O
will O
not O

the O
enormous O

it O

Not O
only O
for O
the O
use O
that O

also O

it O

We O

it O

we O

it O

without O
hesitation O

We O
are O
full O
of O
understanding O
for O
the O

that O
the O

we O
know O
that O
he O

the O

is O
no O

to O

” O

The O
leader O

then O
told O

he O
wants O

. O

As O
for O
D’Alema B-PER
Berlusconi B-PER
, O
he O
says O
he O
is O
“ O
totally O
free O
from O
resentment O
, O
by O
character O

by O

of O

ever O
since O

renews O
his O
respect O

him O
in O
the O
moment O

“ O
I O
have O
always O
shown O
consideration O

I O

the O
melancholy O

stretches O
on O
him O

” O

Then O
Berlusconi B-PER
threw O
a O
bullet O
at O

“ O
It O

Berlusconi B-PER
, O
however O
, O
explains O
that O
he O
has O
found O
“ O
a O
country O
waiting O
to O
be O
quietly O
and O
compostly O
liberated O
from O
the O
pasture O
of O
an O
invasive O
, O
all O

which O

knows O
how O
to O

also O
says O
that O
when O

there O
was O
someone O

warned O
him O

The O
majority O
of O
the O

– O
explains O
Berlusconi B-PER
– O
needed O
not O
only O
an O
alternative O
program O
and O
a O
ruling O

, O
it O
needed O
above O
all O
a O
technique O
of O

an O

to O

adult O

in O

there O
I O

a O

Prodi B-PER
then O
expressed O
his O
no O
on O
any O

to O

change O
the O
rules O
when O

” O

But O
his O
day O
also O
recorded O
a O
row O
of O
controversies O
. O

Within O
the O
alliance O
, O
on O
the O
setting O
of O
the O
counter O
- O
manover O
on O
the O
tax O
, O
challenged O
by O
some O
leaders O
, O
including O
the O
socialist O
Boselli B-PER
, O
because O
“ O
it O
is O
a O
mistake O
to O
come O
down O
on O
Berlusconi B-PER
’s O
ground O
” O
talking O
about O
tax O
cuts O
. O

It O
is O
not O
missing O
the O
strikes O
beyond O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
center O
- O
left O
, O
such O
as O
the O
rush O
of O
rainy O
criticisms O
on O
Prodi B-PER
accused O
by O
the O
CDL B-ORG
of O
having O
instrumentalized O
the O
conversation O
with O
Ciampi B-PER
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
a O
human B-ORG
being O
. O

“ O
I O
think O
of O
Prodi B-PER
’s O
criticism O
all O
the O
evil O
possible O
. O
” O

At O
the O
trade O
union O
demonstration O
against O
the O
financial O
, O
Prodi B-PER
had O
launched O
the O
message O
: O

“ O
It O
’s O
a O
very O
important O
start O
because O
it O
’s O
a O
clear O
demonstration O
of O
the O
state O
of O
discomfort O
towards O
government O
policy O
. O
” O

Immediately O
afterwards O
, O
the O
“ O
professor O
” O
goes O
up O
to O
the O
Quirinale O
and O
later O
, O
to O
journalists O
, O
reports O
the O
meaning O
of O
his O
speech O
to O
Ciampi B-PER
: O

“ O
The O
game O
of O
democracy O
is O
too O
important O
to O
allow O
someone O
to O
cheat O
. O

You O
ca O
n’t O
change O
the O
rules O
when O
the O
game O
is O
over O
. O

The O
rules O
of O
the O
par O
condition O
are O
the O
only O
defense O
, O
though O
partial O
, O
against O
the O
media O
overpower O
and O
therefore O
must O
be O
preserved O
. O

The O
manipulation O
of O
unified O
networks O
in O
recent O
days O
fully O
justifies O
our O
alarm O
. O
” O

But O
to O
the O
head O
of O
state O
, O
Prodi B-PER
emphasizes O
that O
the O
government O
’s O
manoeuvre O
must O
be O
revised O
altogether O
because O
it O
is O
unfounded O
. O

But O
Silvio B-PER
Berlusconi I-PER
, O
from O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
does O
not O
hide O
his O
irritation O
. O

In O
the O
first O
instance O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
or O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
. O

This O
is O
supported O
by O
the O
entire O
CDU B-ORG
. O

His O
sinking O
from O
Madrid B-LOC
is O
in O
fact O
preceded O
and O
followed O
by O
cascading O
criticisms O
especially O
from O
An B-ORG
, O
Forza B-ORG
Italia I-ORG
and O
Lega B-ORG
to O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
Gad B-ORG
. O

And O
the O
Cdl B-ORG
also O
responds O
to O
the O
strike O
, O
considered O
“ O
political O
” O
, O
that O
is O
, O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
Olive B-ORG
. O

The O
only O
soft O
one O
is O
Follini B-PER
who O
says O
he O
respects O
the O
protesters O
, O
but O
does O
not O
share O
the O
motives O
. O

Institutional O
reforms O
and O
the O
enlargement O
of O
the O

key O
priorities O

he O
said O

addressing O
the O

that O

” O

For O
the O

Speroni B-PER
instead O
accused O
Prodi B-PER
of O
asking O
for O
new O
resources O
to O
finance O
the O

“ O

To O
all O

with O
a O
promise O

The O

its O
impossible O

He O
compares O
this O

the O
President O

Massimo B-PER
D'Alema I-PER
, O
last O
night O
in O

“ O
I O

allow O

The O
news O
that O
comes O
from O
America B-LOC

however O
, O
leaves O
us O
literally O
outdoors O
without O

The O
absolution O

a O
punch O

because O
this O

many O

In O

shortly O
after O

however O
, O
the O
Minister O
of O
Economy O
Giulio B-PER
Tremonti I-PER
gives O
different O
instructions O
: O

The O
proposal O
of O
the O
governor O
was O
advanced O
by O
the O
government O
, O
after O
hearing O
the O
Supreme O
Council B-ORG
of O
Bankitalia B-ORG
, O
to O
the O
Quirinale O
who O
signed O
the O
appointment O
. O

The O
same O
procedure O
for O
the O
removal O
of O
the O
Governor O
. O

The O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
was O
preceded O
, O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
by O
a O
visit O

the O

In O

appointment O
of O
the O
governor O
proposed O
by O
the O
government O
, O
with O
the O
binding O
opinion O
of O
a O
qualified O
parliamentary O
majority O
. O

This O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
universe O
, O
and O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
world B-ORG
. O

More O
autonomy O
seems O
to O
guarantee O
the O
solution O
then O
adopted O
, O
because O
it O
would O
strengthen O
the O
role O
of O
the O
Quirinale O
which O
would O
instead O
have O
less O
agility O
of O
intervention O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
decision O
of O
the O
Parliament B-ORG
. O

The O
opinion O
of O
the O
Chambers B-ORG
is O
therefore O
out O
of O
the O
proposal O
of O
the O
government O
and O
the O
solution O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
please O
the O
opposition O
, O
although O
the O
hostility O
towards O
many O
other O
aspects O
of O
the O
reform O
is O
clear O
. O

All O
of O
these O
changes O
have O
been O
confirmed O
by O
the O
new O
government O
amendments O
. O

The O
term O
of O
office O
of O
the O
Governor O
is O
six O
years O
renewable O
: O

The O
Board O
of O
Directors O
, O
which O
assumes O
wider O
powers O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
collegiality O
required O
by O
the O
ECB B-ORG
, O
is O
also O
on O
term O

six O

, O
but O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
appointed O
by O
Bankitalia B-ORG

Supreme I-ORG

Finally O
, O
the O
false O
budget O
. O

The O
government O
proposes O
again O
the O
tighter O
rules O
approved O
by O
the O
House B-ORG
with O
the O
first O
reading O
of O
the O
Savings O
Act O
, O
which O
are O
however O
a O
little O
more O
stringent O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
current O
legislation O
. O

Therefore O
, O
for O
false O
social O
communications O
I O
am O
arrested O
for O
up O
to O
two O
years O
and O
lower O
thresholds O
for O
the O
tightening O
of O
the O
penalties O
for O
those O
who O
cause O
serious O
harm O
. O

This O
is O
when O
the O
number O
of O

has O
exceeded O
0.1 O

But O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
false O
in O
the O

, O
two O
confidence O

expected O

Beware O
of O
the O
Danish O

Rome B-LOC
- O
The O
idea O
of O
playing O
at O
the O
Olympics O
annoyed O
him O
in O
the O
head O
, O
but O
it O
could O
be O
a O
risk O
for O
the O
fear O
of O
fischies O

But O
Dino B-PER
Zoff I-PER
has O
won O
his O
bet O
and O
now O
tries O
to O
stifle O
the O
tones O
. O

“ O
I O
know O
Rome B-LOC
and O
I O
knew O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
would O
come O
, O
but O
maybe O
I O
did O
n’t O
even O
expect O
25,000 O
people O
, O
” O
he O
explains O
, O
“ O
the O
national O
likes O
and O
the O
audience O
is O
numerous O

I O
am O
satisfied O
because O
I O
saw O
many O

they O
came O
to O
the O

quietly O

Of O

, O
there O
were O
some O
fishermen O
in O
Fieri B-PER
, O
but O
less O
than O
I O
expected O

It O
takes O
a O
bit O
of O
clockwork O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n’t O
think O
it O
’s O
gone O
too O
far O

Is O
money O
not O
everything O

They O
are O
never O
everything O

even O
if O
the O

have O
greater O
visibility O
with O
the O

” O

In B-PER
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O

that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O

“ O

in O
the O

we O

it O
enough O

In O

“ O
My O

” O
Ancelotti B-PER
explains O
, O
“ O
are O
technical O

It O
counts O
the O

worked O
in O
the O

I O
do O
n’t O
believe O
in O
the O

It O
is O
true O
, O
Inzaghi B-PER
is O
so O
much O
that O
he O
does O
not O
score O
, O
but O
he O
scored O
5 O
in O
the O
Champions O
Cup O
and O
on O
Sunday O
he O
went O
near O
us O
at O

What O
about O
Kovacevic B-PER
? O

No O
one O

he O

” O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
Ancelotti B-PER
explains O
that O
much O
will O
also O
depend O
“ O
on O
the O
type O
of O
game O
we O
want O
to O
do O
” O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O

that O
this O
is O
the O
most O

part O

the O
life O
of O
a O
human B-ORG

In O

Ancelotti B-PER
notes O
, O
there O

“ O
It O

confirms O
Ancelotti B-PER
– O
that O
will O
tell O

considering O
the O
problems O

just O
a O

” O

Ancelotti B-PER
also O
knows O
well O
that O
his O
fortune O
“ O
is O
linked O
to O
that O
of O
the O

But O
it O
comforts O

we O
went O
to O
the O
pizzeria O
but O
we O
paid O
strictly O
to O
the O
Romanian O
. O
” O

There O
are O
no O
assessments O
in O
short O
, O
and O
even O
from O
this O
one O
understands O
that O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
, O
as O
he O
said O
himself O
, O
knows O
the O
“ O
mechanics O
” O
of O
politics O
: O

Attacking O
a O
potential O
opponent O
mayor O
candidate O
now O
means O
legitimizing O
him O
in O
advance O
, O
giving O
him O
unwittingly O
a O
push O
and O
also O
giving O
him O
the O
opportunity O
to O
test O
the O
reactions O
of O
the O
“ O
enemy O
” O
. O

So O
Ballardini B-PER
avoids O
answering O
, O
if O
he O
digs O
it O
up O
with O
a O
joke O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
summer O
, O
however O
, O
we O
are O
on O
a O
big O
step O
forward O
. O

The O
choice O
of O
“ O
yes O
” O
or O
“ O
no O
” O
by O
Bruno B-PER
Ballardini I-PER
is O
of O
strategic O
importance O
. O

It O
can O
complicate O
or O
make O
things O
easier O
in O
the O
center O
- O
left O
from O
wherever O
you O
look O
at O
it O
. O

If O
he O
remains O
in O
the O
race O
his O
candidacy O
would O
be O
a O
strong O
candidacy O
but O
in O
the O
coalition O
problems O
would O
arise O
: O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
for O
the O
Greens B-ORG
and O
Greens O
to O
accept O
a O
candidate O
for O
mayor O
. O

If O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he O
should O
leave O
the O
center O
left O
he O
will O
have O
to O
find O
a O
strong O
name O
to O
oppose O
Valduga B-PER
who O
has O
the O
right O
cards O
to O
“ O
blow O
off O
” O
the O
left O
from O
the O
Podestà O
Palace O
. O

In O
short O
, O
this O
strange O
roveretan O
summer O
, O
already O
little O
swimming O
for O
the O
climate O
, O
is O
increasingly O
politically O
interesting O
. O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
century O
, O
there O
was O
a O
large O
number O
of O
people B-PER
living O
in B-ORG
the I-ORG
city I-ORG
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
large O
number O
of O
people B-ORG
living O
in O
the B-ORG
city I-ORG
. O

The O
path O
indicated O
by O
Roberto B-PER
Pinter I-PER
to O
get O
to O
the O
date O
with O
the O
polls O
of O
2003 O
with O
a O
single O
list O
of O
the O
left O
is O
quite O
difficult O
. O

Everything O
will O
surely O
go O
up O
. O

“ O
But O
Pinter B-PER
’s O
proposal O
– O
notes O
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
, O
secretary O
of O
the O
Ds B-ORG
– O
is O
overall O
positive O
and O
the O
path O
he O
has O
traced O
is O
shared O
. O
” O

The O
Ds B-ORG
leader O
, O
probably O
, O
would O
have O
preferred O
a O
little O
more O
courage O
. O

His O
ball O
is O
the O
single O
list O
, O
but O
of O
the O
entire O
coalition O
, O
not O
only O
of O
the O
left O
. O

“ O
If O
he O
works O
for O
the O
unity O
of O
the O
left O
– O
he O
admits O
– O
I O
work O
for O
the O
unity O
of O
the O
center O
- O
left O
. O

The O
road O
is O
that O
, O
let O
’s O
see O
if O
we O
stop O
at O
an O
intermediate O
stage O
or O
if O
we O
get O
to O
the O
end O
. O
” O

But O
, O
so O
to O
clarify O
, O
Bondi B-PER
assures O
that O
“ O
I O
, O
on O
the O
united O
left O
, O
would O
put O
the O
signature O
anyway O
. O
” O

More O
critic O
Mauro B-PER
Leveghi I-PER
, O
adviser O
and O
exponent O
of O
the O
Sdi B-ORG
: O

“ O
Pintere B-PER
’s O
proposal O
is O
a O
difficult O
one O
to O
implement O
. O

Not O
impossible O
, O
but O
difficult O
. O
” O

It O
is O
difficult O
because O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
we O
need O
to O
remove O
the O
field O
from O
any O
“ O
prejudiced O
attitude O
towards O
those O
who O
, O
on O
the O
left O
, O
think O
differently O
. O
” O

This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
recent O
changes O
in O
the O
electoral O
legislation O
. O

" O
You O
ca O
n't O
discuss O
alliances O
and O
aggregations O
- O
Leveghi B-PER
confirms O
- O
when O
then O
threatening O
auts O
are O
put O
on O
the O
content O
. O
" O

and O
then O
: O

“ O
Let O
us O
see O
first O
of O
all O
to O
find O
an O
agreement O
on O
the O
electoral O
law O
, O
without O
resorting O
to O
blackmail O
. O
” O

This O
, O
at O
least O
, O
Pinter B-PER
Leveghi B-PER
acknowledges O
: O

“ O
In O
fact O
, O
he O
puts O
himself O
up O
with O
a O
method O
of O
dialogue O
that O
is O
very O
different O
from O
what O
I O
have O
seen O
adopted O
in O
the O
Ds B-ORG
lately O
. O
” O

With O
these O
bases O
, O
assures O
the O
adviser O
, O
it O
can O
be O
discussed O
. O

and O
a O
single O
list O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life B-ORG
. O

“ O
The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
Ds B-ORG
, O
instead O
of O
proposing O
content O
, O
try O
to O
bind O
Dellai B-PER
by O
law O
to O
an O
alliance O
. O

The O
risk O
is O
that O
Dellai B-PER
will O
accept O
the O
challenge O
, O
if O
you O
play O
it O
and O
go O
to O
win O
everything O
at O
the O
head O
of O
a O
big O
center O

” O

Pinter B-PER
’s O
hypothesis O
of O
a O
single O
list O
of O
the O
left O
is O
“ O
less O
worse O
, O
but O
still O
wrong O
. O
” O

And O
then O
? O

“ O
We O
propose O
to O
the O
left O
to O
start O
with O
building B-ORG
communities I-ORG

to O
put O
in O

a O
unitary O

“ O

In O

Beyond O

a O
memory O

epoch O
recalled O

article O

has O

found O
on O

You O
remember O
the O
case O
of O
the O
welfare O
center O
that O
from O
the O
Province B-LOC
has O
obtained O
a O
substantial O
contribution O
in O
the O
area O
of O
funding O
for O
the O
territorial O
pact O
, O
although O
it O
is O
located O
in O
Ravina B-LOC
, O
a O
good O
twenty O
kilometers O
from O
what O
is O
normally O
called O
Bondone B-LOC
area O
? O

This O
is O
why O
, O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
, O
the O
provincial O
counselor O
of O
the O
Sdr B-ORG
Mauro B-PER
Bondi I-PER
( O
as O
well O
as O
his O
colleague O
Denis B-PER
Bertolini I-PER
) O
had O
departed O
to O
submit O
a O
question O
to O
President O
Pallaoro B-PER
. O

The O
objective O
was O
to O
know O
the O
punctual O
list O
of O
all O
the O
investments O
made O
and O
those O
planned O
with O
the O
contributions O
of O
the O
public O
entity O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
Bondi B-PER
asks O
about O
the O
purposes O
of O
a O
series O
of O
“ O
very O
varied O
interventions O
and O
not O
always O
immediately O
attributable O
to O
a O
general O
plan O
for O
the O
rebound O
of O
Monte B-LOC
Bondone I-LOC
” O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
. O

The O
number O
of O
applications O
for O
investments O
by O
private O
individuals O
considered O
consistent O
by O
the O
public O
body O
is O
472 O
, O
for O
an O
amount O
of O
107 O
million O
euros O
. O

A O
lot O
for O
the O
sectors O
that O
are O
universally O
considered O
to O
be O
driving O
the O
revival O
of O
Bondone B-LOC
: O

Tourism O
( O
76 O
million O
) O
, O
ski O
trails O
and O
facilities O
( O
11 O
million O
) O
and O
agricultural O
tourism O
( O
2 O
million O
) O
. O

However O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
, O
within O
the O
contributions O
that O
Dante B-LOC
Square I-LOC
is O
giving O
to O
bring O
the O
mountain O
of O
Trento B-LOC
to O
life O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
various O
hundreds O
of O
euros O
for O
the O
replacement O
of O
boilers O
and O
for O
the O
refurbishment O
of O
the O
facades O
of O
the O
houses O
, O
there O
are O
requests O
for O
a O
contribution O
of O
640 O
thousand O
euros O
that O
will O
be O
used O
for O
the O
refurbishment O
of O
support O
walls O
, O
fencing O
and O
construction O
of O
armed O
land O
. O

not O
only O
. O

Nearly O
one O
million O
and O
100 O
thousand O
euros O
were O
requested O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
new O
fruit O
groves O
, O
the O
construction O
of O
irrigation O
plants O
and O
anti O
- O
grandine O
covers O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
think O
of O
a O
cherry O
plant O
in O
Bondone B-LOC
, O
near O
the O
slopes O
, O
maybe O
positioned O
so O
that O
the O
skiers O
do O
the O
slalom O
in O
the O
middle O
you O
are O
very O
wrong O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Sopramonte B-LOC
and O
Sardinia B-LOC
, O
which O
are O
still O
part O
of O
the O
Bondone B-LOC
district I-LOC
or O
are O
closely O
related O
to O
it O
, O
new O
crops O
will O
also O
arise O
in O
the O
plain O
, O
for O
example O
in O
Romagnano B-LOC
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
use O
of O
this O
product O
is O
not O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
but O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
it O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

They O
will O
be O
used O
for O
the O
purchase O
of O
equipment O
and O
furniture O
in O
the O
rebuilding O
of O
the O
former O
Marlene O
restaurant O
in O
Ravina B-LOC
. O

The O
opening O
of O
the O
lodge O
of O
the O
brothers O
and O
cousins O
Lunelli B-PER
has O
already O
been O
declared O
consistent O
with O
the O
purposes O
of O
the O
Bondone B-LOC
Pact O
, O
as O
it O
falls O
within O
the O
territory O
that O
can O
obtain O
the O
facilities O
. O

Now O
the O
Province B-LOC
will O
have O
to O
carry O
out O
an O
investigation O
to O
verify O
whether O
the O
goods O
for O
the O
purchase O
of O
which O
the O
application O
has O
been O
submitted O
are O
eligible O
and O
whether O
the O
expenditure O
is O
adequate O
. O

On O
the O
costs O
that O
will O
be O
considered O
instrumental O
for O
the O
entrepreneurial O
initiative O
the O
Trade O
Service O
will O
apply O
a O
contribution O
that O
is O
on O
average O
between O
30 O
and O
40 O
percent O
of O
the O
expenditure O
. O

In O
his O
response O
to O
Bondi B-PER
Salvatori B-PER
he O
writes O
that O
the O
objective O
of O
the O
pact O
is O
to O
promote O
a O
“ O
development O
from O
below O
with O
concerted O
projects O
” O
. O

Romagnano B-LOC

200 O

, O
the O
Palon B-LOC

almost O
2,100 O

More O

In O
the O

, O
in O

to O
the O
Cogo B-PER
who O
asks O
for O

“ O
that O

The O

did O
not O
go O
down O

the O
fact O
that O
they O
were O
noticed O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
of O
the O
meeting O
organized O
by O
Berasi B-PER
in O
another O

“ O

it O
is O

that O
the O

So O
an O
urgent O
summit O
of O
the O
Trentino O
centre O

left O
was O
convened O
that O
decided O
to O
give O
a O
perentorio O
ultimatum O
: O

It O
is O
necessary O
that O
by O
23 O
January O
the O
Patt B-ORG
decides O
. O

The O
decision O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
to O
postpone O
everything O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
month O
effectively O
shattered O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
negotiations O
with O
Bolzano B-LOC
, O
where O
a O
limited O
summit O
had O
been O
convened O
for O
yesterday O
afternoon O
, O
then O
updated O
to O
Friday O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
diet B-ORG
. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Volkspartei B-ORG
will O
first O
have O
to O
resolve O
the O
breakdown O
of O
the O
Alto O
- O
Atenan O
majority O
. O

The O
relationship O
with O
the O
Bolshoi O
centre O
- O
left O
has O
been O
severely O
broken O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part B-PER
of O
your O
life B-ORG
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
the O
most O

that O
it O
is O
the O
most B-PER
important I-PER
part O

In O
the O
end O
, O
a O
communiqué O
was O
issued O
in O
which O
the O
centre O
- O
left O
expressed O
: O

“ O
Great O
concern O
. O
” O

But O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
the O
political O
- O
programmatic O
confrontation O
with O
the O
Patt B-ORG
has O
been O
substantially O
positive O
so O
far O
. O

The O
forces O
of O
the O
center O
- O
left O
emphasize O
that O
“ O
in O
common O
agreement O
with O
all O
provincial O
heads O
, O
including O
the O
Patt B-ORG
, O
the O
next O
meeting O
of O
the O
council O
was O
set O
for O
Tuesday O
26 O
January O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
a O
human O
being O
. O

It O
is O
hoped O
that O
this O
decision O
will O
be O
taken O
positively O
, O
supplementing O
the O
assumptions O
of O
agreement O
that O
have O
been O
being O
collectively O
elaborated O
for O
weeks O
now O
. O

If O
it O
is O
not O
so O
, O
first O
of O
all O
by O
respect O
for O
the O
institutional O
obligations O
and O
in O
line O
with O
the O
responsibility O
assumed O
before O
the O
voters O
, O
taking O
into O
account O
also O
the O
serious O
disappointment O
and O
disturbance O
that O
is O
emerging O
in O
the O
public O
opinion O
of O
Trentino B-LOC
, O
the O
center O
- O
left O
coalition O
will O
consider O
it O
obligatory O
and O
unabated O
to O
take O
all O
the O
political O

institutional O
initiatives O
necessary O
for O
the O
proper O
functioning O
of O
the O
provincial O

for O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
provincial O

regional O
governments O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O

is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
use O
of O
the O

or O
the O

Everyone O
denies O
that O
there O
are O
already O
other O
contacts O
ongoing O
with O
the O
“ O
Centre O
” O
, O
but O
it O
is O
logical O
to O
expect O
that O
the O
Dellai B-PER

In O
the O
meeting O
of O
yesterday O
Trentino B-ORG
tomorrow I-ORG
also O
advanced O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
trying O
the O
way O
of O
the O
junta O
of O
“ O
minority O
” O
, O
but O
for O
now O
Dellai B-PER
does O
not O
want O
to O
hear O
about O
it O
. O

It O
was O
Roberto B-PER
Pinter I-PER
of O
Ds B-ORG
. O

“ O
We O
could O
not O
remain O
impassive O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
deadline O
and O
an O
agreed O
document O
. O

To O
follow O
a O
postponement O
meant O
to O
follow O
the O
eternal O
ambiguity O
of O
Patt B-ORG
. O
” O

In O
the O
evening O
came O
the O
reminder O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
with O
which O
the O
presidency O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
is O
claimed O
. O

Reply O
to O
Pinter B-PER
: O

Who O
have O
we O
dealt O
with O
so O
far O
? O

And O
then O
, O
away O
, O
the O
Patt B-ORG
ca O
n’t O
say O
that O
he O
does O
n’t O
agree O
to O
start O
a O
process O
of O
reform O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
and O
then O
want O
to O
lead O
it O
. O
” O

And O
I B-PER
did O
n’t O
like O
the O
reminder O
either O
. O

“ O
I O
hope O
they O
at O
least O
have O
the O
courtesy O
to O
come O
and O
explain O
it O
to O
us O

The O
meeting O

This O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
world B-ORG
. O

Today O
is O
Margherita B-ORG
Day O
. O

At O
9.30 O
( O
Sala O

via B-LOC
Segantini I-LOC
) O
begins O
the O
awaited O
assembly O
of O
the O
members O
. O

A O
meeting O
preceded O
by O
the O
work O
of O
amending O
the O
statute O
and O
the O
announcement O
by O
President O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
that O
he O
wants O
to O
start O
a O
“ O
ethical O
turnaround O
” O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
important O
meeting O
, O
especially O
after O
the O
arrest O
of O
the O
former O
roveretan O
counselor O
Fabio B-PER
Dematté I-PER
and O
the O
rumors O
that O
have O
otherwise O
involved O
some O
members O
of O
the O
party O
. O

and O
moral O
. O

No O
need O
to O
hide O
it O
: O

Moral O
issues O
will O
be O
the O
main O
topic O
of O
the O
day O
. O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
there O
have O
also O
been O
people O
who O
have O
raised O
their O
voices O
. O

The O
first O
of O
them O
was O
Giorgio B-PER
Viganò I-PER
, O
the O
provincial O
councillor O
who O
raised O
five O
objections O
: O

too O
much O
power O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
advisors O
; O

Wrong O
appointment O
of O
Grandes B-PER
to O
the O
A22 B-ORG
; O

Mistaken O
nomination O
of O
Nicolini B-PER
to O
the O
Bim B-ORG
of I-ORG
the O
Church O
; O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life B-PER
. O

There O
is O
no O
risk O
of O
professional O
conflict O
of O
interest O
. O

Beppe B-PER
Zorzi I-PER
has O
called O
for O
an O
extraordinary O
congress O
. O

Giorgio B-PER
Lunelli I-PER
replied O
that O
an O
“ O
extraordinary O
” O
response O
will O
be O
seen O
today O
. O

The O
verticals O
. O

With O
the O
amendment O
of O
the O
statute O
of O
the O
party O
, O
Margherita B-ORG
will O
change O
some O
rules O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
should O
be O
remembered O
that O
the O
registration O
will O
be O
public O
. O

The O
provincial O
coordinator O
will O
also O
be O
elected O
by O
the O
assembly O
and O
not O
by O
the O
parliamentary O
. O

In O
these O
days O
no O
one O
has O
come O
to O
ask O
for O
Mauro B-PER
Betta I-PER
’s O
resignation O
, O
who O
on O
his O
part O
has O
preferred O
to O
keep O
a O
low O
profile O
. O

So O
far O
, O
he O
has O
given O
some O
answers O
: O

“ O
As O
for O
the O
junta O
and O
the O
extraordinary O
congress O
, O
we O
can O
discuss O
it O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

This O
will O
happen O
after O
the O
political O
elections O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
use O
of O
this O
product O
is O
not O
a O
good O
thing O
for O
the O
health B-ORG
of O
the O
patient O
. O

The O
Politics O
. O

Today O
’s O
assembly O
will O
also O
serve O
to O
make O
a O
point O
on O
the O
elections O
of O
April O
9 O
. O

The O
Romanian O
transfer O
of O
Lorenzo B-PER
Dellai I-PER
last O
days O
served O
to O
clarify O
but O
somehow O
also O
brought O
a O
cold O
shower O
. O

This O
is O
because O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O
political O
party O
. O

In O
addition B-ORG
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
or O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product B-LOC
. O

What O
about O
the O
cold O
shower O
? O

Yes O
, O
because O
it O
was O
understood O
that O
the O
Volkspartei B-ORG
from O
Bolzano B-LOC
has O
a O
direct O
link O
with O
Rome B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
Gianclaudio B-PER
Bressa I-PER
will O
have O
to O
be O
“ O
settled O
” O
into O
the O
Regional B-ORG
Union I-ORG
, O
taking O
space O
for O
a O
Trentino O
candidate O
. O

But O
there O
is O
another O
hope O
: O

If O
Bressa B-PER
himself O
was O
called O
to O
the O
government O
, O
he O
could O
leave O
the O
seat O
of O
deputy O
to O
the O
first O
of O
the O
unelected O
. O

and O
autonomous O
. O

It O
is O
now O
apparent O
the O
“ O
passage O
” O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
from O
the O
proportional O
Union B-ORG
to O
the O
Volkspartei B-ORG
. O

The O
candidate O
could O
be O
Giacomo B-PER
Bezzi I-PER
( O
or O
Franco B-PER
Panizza I-PER
as O
an O
alternative O
) O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life B-ORG
. O

A O
way O
to O
weigh O
the O
votes O
of O
Patt B-ORG
once O
and O
for O
all O
. O

However O
, O
Giacomo B-PER
Bezzi I-PER
denies O
any O
warlike O
intent O
: O

“ O
We O
were O
allowed O
to O
participate O
on O
two O
conditions O
: O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
get O
to O
know O
what O
we O
’re O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
. O

We O
do O
n’t O
change O
our O
mind O
. O
” O

But O
the O
space O
conquered O
by O
Bressa B-PER
with O
the O
blessing O
of O
Prodi B-PER
risks O
making O
the O
race O
to O
Rome B-LOC
of O
the O
Civica B-ORG
trentina I-ORG
much O
more O
difficult O
. O

The O
Patt B-ORG
who O
takes O
off O
a O
seat O
to O
the O
Margarita B-ORG
: O

It O
would O
be O
a O
joke O

who O
wanted O

In O
the O
event O
of O
the O
decision O
, O
the O
entrepreneur O
of O

appealed O
to O
the O
Tar B-ORG
against O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Production O
and O
against O
Uniriscossioni B-ORG
. O

The O
administrative O
judges O
, O
however O
, O
declared O
themselves O
incompetent O
by O
postponing O
any O
decision O
to O
the O
civil O

. O

The O
Department O
of O
Industry O
, O
on O
February O
2 O
, O
1987 O
, O
approved O
a O

of O

The O
loan O
should O
have O
been O
repayed O
in O
15 O
years O
: O

In O
the O
first O
five O
years O
only O
interest O
was O
paid O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
2.115 O
% O
, O
in O
the O
remaining O
10 O
years O
the O
capital O
was O
to O
be O
reimbursed O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
8.46 O
% O
. O

Since O
1992 O
, O
the O
Syriza B-ORG
, O
due O
to O
force O
majeure O
, O
has O
failed O
to O
comply O
. O

As O
of O
July O
1989 O
, O
however O
, O
the O
company O
was O
not O
paying O
due O
to O
the O
seizure O
of O
the O
factory O
ordered O
by O
the O
court O
following O
the O
fire O
that O
cost O
the O
lives O
of O
two O
people O
. O

On O
11 O
April O
2000 O
, O
the O
Ministry O
communicated O
to O
the O
company O
that O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
repayment O
of O
the O
amortisation O
rates O
of O
the O
granted O
funding O
had O
not O
been O
received O
, O
inviting O
the O
same O
to O
transmit O
them O
within O
thirty O
days O
. O

This O
would O
have O
resulted O
in O
the O
termination O
of O
the O
contract O
ipso O

. O

On O
12 O
June O
2001 O
, O
the O
Dicastery O
, O
having O
not O
received O
a O
response O
, O
reiterated O
its O
intention O
to O
use O
the O
resolution O
clause O
and O
announced O
that O
the O
amount O
owed O
amounted O
to O
more O
than O
two O

to O
be O
paid O
within O
60 O
days O
. O

In O
order O
to O
keep O
the O
silence O
of O
Siric B-ORG
, O
the O
Minister O
activated O
the O
forced O
recovery O
procedure O
of O

notifying O
the O

This O
was O
the O
case O
that O
Zadra B-PER
appealed O
to O
the O

In O
the O

regulated O
in O
its O

by O
the O

It O
is O
a O

a O

which O
was O
expressly O

in O
the O

of O
11 O
April O
2000 O

12 O

The O

considers O
that O

so O
it O
happened O

coming O
up O

great O
declarations O

a O
central O
point O
on O
the O
agenda O

. O

“ O
Any O

, O
” O
he O
added O
, O
“ O
could O
lead O
to O
many O
complications O
. O
” O

Like O
his O
American O
counterpart O
, O
Putin B-PER
did O
not O
hide O
the O
differences O
that O
emerged O
during O
the O
talks O
, O
which O
he O
described O
as O
“ O
very O
open O
and O
very O
interesting O
” O
. O

“ O
We O
have O
evaluated O
the O
past O
, O
present O
and O
future O
of O
our O
countries O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
we O
have O
found O
a O
great O
basis O
for O
developing O
our O
cooperation O
, O
but O
we O
can O
not O
overcome O
the O
differences O
that O
exist O
between O
us O
at O
once O
. O
” O

“ O
We O
will O
start O
from O
those O
elements O
that O
unite O
us O
, O
the O
threats O
must O
be O
precisely O
defined O
and O
it O
is O
best O
to O
do O
it O
together O
, O
” O
Putin B-PER
said O
, O
who O
announced O
the O
opening O
of O
a O
security O
negotiating O
table O
that O
will O
be O
entrusted O
to O
the O
foreign O
and O
defence O
ministers O
. O

Bush B-PER
also O
highlighted O
the O
difficulties O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
showed O
that O
he O
considered O
them O
a O
starting O
point O
. O

“ O
We O
are O
speaking O
differently O
, O
but O
we O
know O
it O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
Russia B-LOC
is O
an O
important O
country O
, O
we O
can O
collaborate O
meaningfully O
. O
” O

And O
he O
offered O
Putin B-PER
a O
credit O
certificate O
. O

“ O
I O
looked O
this O
man O
in O
the O
eyes O
, O
” O
Bush B-PER
said O
, O
repeating O
what O
Ronald B-PER
Reagan I-PER
said O
about O
Mikhail B-PER
Gorbachev I-PER
, O
“ O
it O
’s O
worth O
believing O
him O
, O
we O
’ve O
given O
him O
our O
trust O
. O
” O

Bush B-PER
guaranteed O
U.S. B-LOC
economic O
commitment O
to O
Russia B-LOC
by O
ensuring O
the O
upcoming O
arrival O
of O
delegations O
of O
businessmen O
to O
Moscow B-LOC
. O

He O
also O
stressed O
the O
need O
for O
NATO B-ORG
enlargement O
. O

“ O
It O
will O
be O
wise O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
Russia B-LOC
will O
have O
friends O
at O
its O
borders O
. O

Putin B-PER
first O
recalled O
a O
secret O
document O
from O
1954 O
that O
excluded O
any O
possible O
collaboration O
and O
then O
returned O
to O
a O
very O
different O
present O
. O

“ O
NATO B-ORG
is O
not O
Russia B-LOC
’s O
enemy O
, O
but O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
determined O
whether O
it O
is O
a O
military O
body O
or O
not O
. O
” O

From O
the O

And O
the O
small O
Slovenia B-LOC

to O
have O
deserved O
the O
gift O

the O

that O
the O

As O
for O

“ O
The O
concert O

what O

I’t O

I O
usually O

makes O

there O

As O
for O

Why O
is O
Carmen B-PER

“ O
It O
all O

sound O
engineer O
Allan B-PER
Goldberg I-PER

She O
and O
her O
friend O
tried O
to O
get O
him O
to O
learn O
the O
use O
of O
the O
female O
in O
Italian O
. O

To O
make O
them O
understand O
it O
better O
, O
they O
picked O
up O
a O
dog O
named O
Mela O
. O

They O
told O
him O
that O
in O
Italian O
the O
female O
dog O
is O
called O
“ O
Canessa O
” O
. O

Allan B-PER
Goldberg I-PER
also O
used O
the O
suffix O
“ O
she O
” O
for O
other O
names O

As O
the O
substantive O
“ O

” O
sounded O
badly O
to O
him O
for O
Carmen B-PER

he O
called O
her O
“ O

Hence O
the O
origin O
of O
his O

What O
about O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
bison O
that O
on O
a O
snow O
day O
, O
he O
was O
" O
squeezing O
" O
with O

as O
pharmacists O
usually O
do O
when O
they O
have O
to O
prepare O
some O
galenic O
product O

It O
is O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
straight O
, O
abundant O
snow O
that O
falls O
and O
blows O
you O
the O
temperatures O
, O
and O
reminds O
you O
that O
the O
mountain O
is O
symbiosis O
is O
poetry O
is O
immense O
solitude O

where O
an O

The O

is O
silence O

The O

of O
the O

It O
is O

that O
the O

In O

he O
already O

what O
to O

for O
the O

of O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
note O
that O
, O
in O
the O

, O
you O
will O
be O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product B-ORG
is O
not O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
but O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
product B-PER
is O
a O
good O
product O
and O
that O
the O
product B-PER
is O
a O
good O
product O
. O

In O
the O
game O
the O
face O
, O
because O
the O
passage O
of O
the O
turn O
is O
the O
last O
chance O
of O
ransom O
. O

And O
then O
you O
will O
have O
to O
fight O
, O
rather O
than O
against O
the O
opponents O
– O
on O
the O
paper O
absolutely O
affordable O
to O
do O
only O
the O
account O
of O
the O
technical O
potential O
– O
against O
the O
complex O
of O
San O
Siro O
, O
measure O
yourself O
with O
that O
finite O
love O
, O
against O
that O
terrible O
“ O
We O
do O
n’t O
know O
how O
to O
insult O
you O
anymore O
” O
that O
summarizes O
the O
attitude O
of O
hatred O
that O
only O
betrayed O
lovers O
can O
experience O
. O

Inside O
and O
alone O
. O

In O
the O
indifference O
that O
is O
worse O
than O
the O
dispute O
. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
case O
for O
Massimo B-PER
Moratti I-PER
, O
expected O
in O

at O
the O

. O

It O

There O
is O
no O
one O
beyond O
the O

, O
not O
even O
the O
usual O

of O

. O

Zaccheroni B-PER
and O
his O

Marco B-PER
Branca I-PER

It O
is O
time O
to O
tighten O
up O
and O
there O
are O
all O
, O
including O
Adriano B-PER

Stankovic B-PER
, O
the O
last O

ones O
who O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
play O
in O
the O
UEFA O

. O

This B-PER
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
get O
to O
know O
what O
we O
’re O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
“ O

” O
began O
with O
the O
speeches O
of O

A O

immediately O
after O

A O
speech O
, O
as O
is O
known O
, O
“ O
pacified O
, O
but O
with O
important O
contents O
” O
. O

The O
leaders O
would O
have O
asked O
the O
team O
to O
stay O
united O
to O
try O
to O
get O
to O
the O
main O
goal O
, O
the O
Champions O
League O
area O
, O
that O
fourth O
place O
in O
the O
ranking O
that O
the O

of O
Udinese B-ORG

Parma B-ORG
and O
Lazio B-ORG
have O
not O
moved O
further O
. O

Zaccheroni B-PER
remains O
- O
he O
was O
also O
insured O
- O
and O
every O
process O
is O
postponed O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
. O

Then O
, O
and O
only O
then O
will O
be O
the O
time O
to O
pull O
the O
sums O
. O

With O
the O
balance O
sheet O
for O
each O
of O
the O
components O
of O
the O
rose O
and O
the O
technical O
staff O
. O

Then O
he O
started O
working O
in O
the O
field O
again O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it B-PER
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
. O

From O
the O
race O
against O
the O
Yellow O
Russians O
began O
the O
adventure O
of O
Zaccheroni B-PER
; O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we B-PER
have O
been O
able O
to O
get O
to O
know O
what O
is O
happening O
. O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
year O
, O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
has O
approved O
the O
proposal O
of O
the O
European O
Parliament O
and O
of O
the O
Council O
of O
the O
European O
Parliament O
and O
of O
the O
Council O

In O
the O

, O
Appiano B-LOC
will O
reopen O

the O

for O
the O
traditional O
press O
conference O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
Alberto B-PER
Zaccheroni I-PER
. O

And O
only O
then O
will O
you O
be O
able O
to O
try O
to O
find O
out O
if O
the O
cure O
worked O
, O
if O
the O
conviction O
returned O
. O

Trento B-ORG
, O
a O
podium O
to O
close O

In O
Pizzighettone B-LOC
ends O
the O
adventure O
of O
Capuzzo B-PER

It O
is O
also O
the O
day O
when O
the O
third O
book O
of O
the O
adventure O
of O
Gigi B-PER
Capuzzo I-PER
in O
yellow O
blue O
is O
closed O
. O

The O
first O
spoke O
of O
an O
attacker O
from O
the O
bright O
career O
, O
" O
better O
as O
a O
young O
man O
, O
who O
then O
" O
( O
as O
says O
the O
same O
Gigetto B-PER
) O
who O
to O
Trento B-ORG
brought O
games O
from O
the O
true O
tip O
of O
the O
area O
of O
rigour O
and O
a O
dozen O
networks O
. O

The O
second O
was O
the O
story O
of O
a O
technician O
with O
great O
human O
gifts O
, O
who O
accidentally O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
wrong O
place O
at O
the O
right O
time O
: O

In O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
inevitable O
social O
disruptions O
due O
to O
the O
change O
of O
hand O
between O
the O
old O
management O
and O
the O
current O
involved O
him O
, O
beyond O
any O
demerit O
; O

Gillette B-PER
paid O
in O
person O
: O

He O
was O
resigned O
, O
then O
called O
back O
and O
brought O
the O
Trento B-ORG
to O
safety O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
very O
easy O
situation O
to O
overcome O
, O
when O
you O
start O
to O
win O
and O
find O
yourself O
at O
a O
step O
from O
the O
pit O
of O
a O
humiliating O
retrocession O
in O
the O
regional O
championships O
. O

The O
third O
volume O
ends O
today O
. O

Capuzzo B-PER
did O
what O
he O
was O
asked O
to O
do O
with O
a O
team O
that O
could O
hardly O
give O
more O
: O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
year O
, O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
get B-PER
the O
most O
out O
of O
the O
world O
. O

But O
trouble O
and O
various O
vicissitudes O
have O
often O
wrecked O
the O
wings O
of O
the O
eagles O
. O

The O
third O
place O
in O
the O
pitch O
at O
Pizzighettone B-LOC
today O
( O
in O
case O
of O
victory O
would O
be O
certain O
, O
although O
probably O
in O
cohabitation O
) O
would O
represent O
a O
fair O
award O
( O
and O
a O
recognition O
) O
to O
the O
professionalism O
of O
a O
group O
that O
defeat O
against O
the O
Oggiono B-ORG
risked O
to O
undermine O
the O
foundations O
. O

But O
in O
certain O
situations O
the O
“ O
good O
” O
company O
helps O
. O

And O
what O
happened O
, O
at O
many O
other O
levels O
, O
to O
the O
Inter B-ORG
helps O
to O
ease O
the O
burden O
of O
that O
defeat O
. O

Play O
for O
greetings O
, O
and O
for O
a O
ransom O
that O
Capuzzo B-PER
asks O
of O
the O
players O
; O

Some O
will O
stay O
( O
it O
’s O
already O
written O
) O
, O
others O
will O
make O
the O
suitcases O
. O

As O
it O
happens O
to O
Gigi B-PER
that O
would O
have O
wanted O
to O
write O
with O
all O
of O
himself O
also O
the O
fourth O
volume O
of O
his O
yellow O
- O
blue O
experience O
; O

He O
hoped O
for O
the O
return O
of O
the O
teachers O
. O

Instead O
, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
podium O
. O

We O
are O

up O

And O
then O
we O
thought O

put O
him O
out O

The O

in O

Now O
I O

a O
meeting O

dimension O
of O

it O
a O

The O
large O

, O
that O
they O
understood O
the O

this O

Both O

the O
validity O

In O
the O

provincial O

pointed O
out O
that O
the O

of O
the O

, O
such O
as O

represent O
an O
objective O
and O
not O
a O
achieved O
result O
. O

The O
rapporteur O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
highlighted O
the O
numerous O
discriminatory O
factors O
still O
present O
, O
including O
the O
diversity O
of O
remuneration O
that O
distinguishes O
the O
achievement O
of O
similar O
results O
between O

and O
male O
and O
female O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
use O
of O
this O
product O
is O
not O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if B-PER
you O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
the O
software O
, O
you O
will O
be O

use O
the O

and O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
use O
the O
software O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-ORG
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product O
. O

There O
is O
no O
shortage O
of O
questions O
about O
the O
less O
edifying O
aspects O
of O
sport O
such O
as O
doping O
: O

The O
champions O
emphasized O
that O
such O
aspects O
, O
especially O
at O
the O
level O
of O
information O
bodies O
, O
can O
not O
obscure O
the O
promotion O
and O
results O
of O
sports O
activities O
, O
especially O
those O
less O
promoted O
and O
that O
at O
the O
Olympic O
level O
always O
bring O
the O
most O
victories O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
get O
to O
know O
what O
we O
’re O
going O
to O
be O
doing O

“ O
Distances O
are O
reduced O
” O

by O
Andreotti B-PER
: O

It O
’s O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
get B-LOC
to O
know O
what O
you O
’re O
looking O
for O
. O

“ O
You O
ca O
n’t O
find O
the O
square O
of O
the O
circle O
, O
even O
the O
axis O
of O
Dellai B-PER
Durnwalder B-PER
finds O
it O
difficult O
. O
” O

Is O
this O
what O
makes O
you O
happy O
, O
Mr. O
Andreotti B-PER
? O

No O
of O
course O
. O

I O
feel O
less O
satisfied O
with O
these O
difficulties O
of O
Those B-PER
with O
whom O
I O
have O
a O
great O
relationship O
. O

But O
it O
is O
when O
the O
newspapers O
are O
clamorously O
denied O
that O
I O
am O
happy O
. O

We O
were O
considered O
traitors O
because O
we O
postponed O
every O
decision O
, O
but O
from O
the O
stall O
of O
the O
negotiations O
we O
understand O
that O
even O
if O
there O
was O
the O
parliamentary O
of O
Patt B-ORG
nothing O
would O
have O
been O
done O
... O

But O
the O
distance O
from O
the O
center O
- O
left O
on O
the O
region B-LOC
has O
decreased O
. O

and O
yes O
. O

In O
different O
languages O
, O
we O
all O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

The O
substance O
is O
not O
far O
away O
. O

The O
big O
problem O
is O
the O
so O
- O
called O
reversal O
of O
the O
Region B-LOC
envisaged O
by O
the O
Bicamerale O
. O

And O
probably O
in O
all O
this O
some O
assessment O
mistake O
Dellai B-PER
did O
. O

If O
diplomatically O
he O
moved O
differently O
, O
on O
18 O
December O
in O
provincial O
council O
he O
became O
president O
. O

And O
even O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
SVP B-ORG
they O
wanted O
to O
advance O
the O
times O
. O

I O
say O
it O
calmly O
, O
without O
criticism O
. O

Are O
you O
building O
a O
new O
region B-LOC
? O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
find O
a O
solution O
to O
this O
problem O
, O
and O
we O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
find O
a O
solution O
to O
this O
problem B-LOC
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
paradox O
: O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
get O
to O
know O
what O
we O
’re O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
. O

The O
SP B-ORG
has O
never O
really O
spoken O
. O

Brugger B-PER
only O
said O
, O
" O
between O
the O
two O
disputants O
we O
take O
it O
. O
" O

It O
was O
a O
joke O
. O

We O
have O
been O
accused O
of O
being O
the O
foolish O
servants O
of O
the O
SVP B-ORG
, O
but O
at O
the O
moment O
when O
we O
go O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Region B-LOC
, O
the O
thirty O
say O
to O
the O
SVP B-ORG
: O
“ O
Decide O
yourself O
. O
” O

This O
is O
not O
the O
behavior O
to O
be O
taken O
. O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
want O
Brugger B-PER
’s O
blessing O
, O
because O
then O
it O
would O
mean O
we O
’re O
kneeling O
, O
as O
I O
fear O
somebody O
has O
done O
. O

The O
support O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
is O
strange O
. O

It O
is O
true O
, O
but O
on O
topics O
such O
as O
guarantee O
I O
have O
always O
appreciated O
Rumor B-PER
. O

There O
is O
less O
agreement O
on O
the O
area O
. O

But O
we O
wonder O
why O
the O
SPP B-ORG
wants O
to O
make O
homologues O
and O
then O
does O
n’t O
want O
them O

be O
the O

is O
certain O
that O
the O
« O
Giro O

has O
behind O
a O
tradition O
that O

agonistic O

For O

Many O
cycling O
enthusiasts O
of O
a O
certain O
age O

will O
go O
back O
with O
the O

to O

Rizieri B-PER
Brunialti I-PER
was O
the O

in O
the O
distant O
1927 O
and O
write O
his O
name O
in O
the O
gold O
orbs O
of O
the O

, O
a O
race O
that O
knew O
few O
interruptions O
, O
which O
ran O
even O
during O
the O

, O
since O
then O
it O
was O
reserved O
for O
the O
categories O
very O
young O
, O
beginners O
, O
aspirants O
, O
students O
who O
at O

The O

In O

Closed O
in O
1972 O
the O
happy O
parenthesis O
of O
the O
Grand O

while O
the O
Giro O

continues O
its O
long O
history O
with O
the O
various O
categories O
of O
beginners O

, O
the O

And O
then O
why O
not O
open O
to O
the O
race O
also O
the O
amateurs O
, O
less O
and O
less O
cyclists O
for O
joke O
, O
more O
and O
more O
real O
athletes O
, O
often O
stronger O
than O
some O
professionals O
? O

In O
1993 O
, O
the O
Bolghera O
officially O
opened O
to O
amateurs O
, O
winning O
Maurizio B-PER

And O
in O
the O

we O
find O
names O
like O
Valentini O

three O

the O
highest O
stage O
of O
the O
podium O
, O
Bazzanella B-PER
Grisenti B-PER

Benedetti B-PER
, O
no O

very O
young O
but O
always O
very O
strong O
and O
above O
all O
very O
in O
love O
with O
the O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
your O
life O
, O
and O
that O

With O
him O
many O
other O
athletes O
, O
of O
different O
ages O
, O
but O
all O
shared O
by O
a O
single O
passion O
, O
the O
bicycle O
: O

This O
is O
a O
competition O
that O
is O
celebrated O
this O
year O
. O

This O
is O
his O
nineteenth O
edition O
. O

Sorry O
if O
it O
is O
too O
little O
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
go O
into O
museums O
. O

This O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O

and O

important O
part O
of O

. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
recognize O
myself O
in O
the O
title O
with O
effect O
“ O
Dellai O
eja O
i O
musei O
” O
with O
which O
you O
wanted O
to O
present O
my O
intervention O
, O
putting O
a O
name O
in O
the O
head O
of O
an O
article O
in O
which O
, O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
the O
discussion O
on O
the O
plane O
of O
ideas O
and O
principles O
, O
I O
had O
very O
well O
taken O
care O
not O
to O
do O
so O
. O

The O
intervention O
itself O
was O
thus O
a O
sort O
of O
pre O
- O
electoral O
" O
sassada O
" O
, O
according O
to O
a O
style O
that O
is O
however O
entirely O
alien O
to O
the O
intentions O
, O
interests O
and O
the O
way O
of O
working O
of O
the O

The O

can O
be O
found O
in O

a O

a O

How O
sad O

In O

cold O

like O

The O
Papi O

How O
much O
violence O

In O
healthy O
families O

I O
am O
referring O
to O
the O
letter O
of O
Mrs. O
Francesca B-PER
Agnoli I-PER
, O
published O
on O
October O
8 O
, O
in O
which O
she O
complains O
about O
the O
danger O
of O
recognition O
of O
homosexual O
couples O
, O
especially O
if O
this O
also O
preludes O
the O
possible O
permission O
for O
adoption O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
remind O
you O
that O
marriage O
, O
beyond O
the O
sacrality O
of O
which O
it O
has O
been O
clothed O
throughout O
history O
, O
has O
been O
and O
remains O
essentially O
a O
contract O
. O

To O
be O
able O
to O
freely O
conclude O
a O
contract O
with O
legal O
value O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
right O
of O
all O
. O

As O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
only O
a O
“ O
traditional O
family O
is O
an O
environment O
suitable O
for O
a O
healthy O
and O
psychologically O
balanced O
growth O
” O
is O
just O
the O
usual O
stereotype O
. O

I O
invite O
the O
gentle O
lady O
to O
read O
the O
reports O
of O
Blue B-ORG
Phone I-ORG
, O
the O
data O
on O
domestic O
violence O
or O
even O
, O
simply O
, O
the O
daily O
chronicles O
, O
which O
record O
, O
with O
impressive O
frequency O
, O
massacres O
within O
seemingly O
healthy O
and O
balanced O
families O
. O

Instead O
, O
I O
feel O
offensive O
the O
affirmations O
of O
the O
gentle O
lady O
against O
all O
parents O
either O
adoptive O
, O
or O
become O
such O
with O
the O
help O
of O
medicine O
, O
" O
considered O
free O
to O
order O
the O
children O
in O
the O
probation O
, O
as O
it O
is O
done O
with O
a O
pet O
dog O
, O
and O
then O
raise O
a O
child O
not O
them O
, O
who O
does O
not O
recognize O
in O
them O
a O
common O
genetic O
heritage O
... O
" O

The O
lady O
is O
then O
scandalized O
by O
the O
idea O
that O
“ O
it O
is O
permissible O
for O
women O
, O
with O
a O
dedicated O
kit O
for O
self O
- O
insemination O
and O
a O
syringe O
containing O
sperm O
, O
distributed O
by O
the O
Archilesbica B-ORG
, O
to O
have O
children O
alone O
, O
in O
their O
home O
. O
” O

For O
centuries O
, O
women O
have O
had O
children O
alone O
. O

Until O
recently O
, O
a O
moral O
hypocrisy O
has O
stigmatized O
them O
. O

Well O
that O
went O
they O
were O
called O
girls O
- O
mothers O
, O
more O
often O
with O
shameful O
epithetics O
. O

The O
novelty O
that O
the O
gentle O
lady O
condemns O
, O
is O
the O
idea O
that O
women O
can O
deliberately O
choose O
to O
have O
a O
child O
“ O
on O
their O
own O
” O
. O

But O
this O
is O
something O
that O
nature O
, O
whose O
laws O
the O
gentle O
lady O
invokes O
, O
allows O
very O
well O
. O

I O
suppose O
that O
the O
lady O
, O
writing O
, O
that O
“ O
nature O
clearly O
predicts O
that O
man O
is O
born O
in O
a O
certain O
way O
, O
without O
manipulation O
and O
artificial O
coercion O
” O
intended O
instead O
to O
condemn O
all O
surgeries O
, O
transplants O
, O
artificial O
valves O
, O
transfusions O
, O
even O
medicines O
and O
so O
on O
, O
as O
manipulations O
and O
artificial O
coercion O
that O
contradict O
the O
natural O
course O
of O
things O
. O

ecumenism O
into O
play O
, O
we O
think O
that O
the O
Trentino O
society O
has O
already O
given O
demonstrations O
of O
welcome O
, O
respect O
, O
openness O
to O
dialogue O
not O
to O
fear O
charges O
of O
closure O
due O
to O
the O
perplexities O
aroused O
by O
the O
request O
of O
Imam O
Breigheche B-PER
. O

And O
we O
do O
n’t O
like O
that O
the O
lack O
of O
reciprocity O
of O
treatment O
toward O
Christian O
communities O
in O
Islamic O
countries O
is O
put O
simply O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
crap O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
much O
more O
complex O
. O

It O
is O
also O
a O
compulsion O
to O
interpret O
this O
requirement O
of O
the O
Islamic O
community O
as O
a O
signal O
of O
openness O
or O
willingness O
to O
integrate O
into O
the O
society O
that O
welcomes O
it O
. O

The O
Imam O
Breigheche B-PER
is O
simply O
fulfilling O
his O
task O
, O
which O
is O
to O
gain O
more O
and O
more O
space O
for O
his O
community O
. O

Full O
freedom O
of O
religion O
and O
worship O
is O
out O
of O
question O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
right O
to O
testify O
and O
pass O
on O
your O
faith O
to O
your O
children O
, O
but O
doing O
so O
in O
schools O
is O
another O
matter O
. O

Mostly O
because O
we O
know O
that O
for O
Islam O
religious O
authority O
is O
often O
one O
with O
political O
and O
civil O
authority O
, O
unlike O
Christianity O
. O

This O
is O
the O
core O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

The O
Quran O
is O
the O
sacred O
book O
of O
Islam O
, O
as O
such O
deserves O
respect O
and O
respect O
. O

But O
we O
also O
know O
that O
there O
are O
various O
possibilities O
of O
interpretation O
of O
this O
text O
. O

Without O
shaking O
the O
whisper O
of O
the O
more O
fundamentalist O
ones O
who O
exalt O
the O
sacrifice O
of O
kamikazes O
to O
kill O
in O
the O
name O
of O
holy O
war O
, O
it O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
survive O
in O
Islamic O
countries O
sad O
and O
for O
us O
unacceptable O
realities O
such O
as O
stoning O
, O
infibulation O
, O
segregation O
and O
female O
discrimination O
. O

We O
can O
not O
ignore O
the O
profound O
conflict O
within O
Islam O
between O
the O
more O
integralist O
and O
the O
more O
moderate O
souls O
, O
but O
we O
can O
not O
think O
of O
intervening O
or O
imposing O
the O
ways O
of O
teaching O
and O
interpreting O
the O
Qur’an O
. O

We O
testify O
to O
our O
values O
of O
freedom O
, O
respect O
for O
the O
person O
, O
tolerance O
and O
equality O
, O
we O
have O
left O
behind O
for O
centuries O
the O
Crusades O
and O
the O
Inquisition O
. O

The O
Islamic O
communities O
that O
are O
welcomed O
into O
our O
society O
can O
find O
in O
the O
Western O
world O
a O
precious O
opportunity O
to O
move O
away O
from O
fundamentalism O
and O
integralism O
, O
if O
they O
wish O
. O

But O
how O
to O
live O
its O
own O
faith O
remains O
a O
question O
that O
the O
Islamic O
world O
must O
face O
within O
itself O
, O
first O
, O
and O
then O
by O
dialogue O
and O
confronting O
itself O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
if O
it O
is O
willing O
to O
do O
so O
, O
with O
the O
other O
faiths O
, O
with O
the O
Catholic O
world O
. O

But O
in O
no O
case O
and O
under O
no O
circumstances O
at O
this O
time O
this O
responsibility O
can O
be O
loaded O
onto O
our O
school O
system O
, O
which O
can O
not O
and O
must O
not O
become O
the O
interlocutor O
, O
neither O
the O
scope O
nor O
the O
means O
to O
handle O
this O
very O
delicate O
issue O

who O
necessarily O
set O
up O

the O

I O

a O

These O

our O

have O

" O
almost O
all O
" O
to O
school O
after O
the O
Easter O

I O
write O
" O
almost O

because O
even O
this O
year O
, O
and O
this O
year O
, O
the O
calendar O
of O
the O
Easter O

has O
caused O
a O
real O
dismay O
in O
the O

I O
consider O
myself O
one O
of O
the O
lucky O
ones O
because O
my O
two O
daughters O
’ O
“ O

” O
were O
distributed O
over O
the O

period O
. O

But O
unfortunately O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case O
for O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
thirty O

who O
, O
having O
two O
or O
more O
children O
enrolled O
in O
different O
educational O
institutions O
in O
the O
province B-LOC

had O

sometimes O
even O
making O

so O

called O
" O

, O
asking O
for O

and O
permits O
to O
their O

finding O
themselves O
forced O
to O
have O
to O
enjoy O
holidays O
they O
would O
gladly O
enjoy O
in O
the O
summer O
period O

This O

the O

stipulates O
the O
end O
of O

in O
the O
first O
days O
of O
June O
and O
the O

in O
the O

in O

Faith O

just O

After O
reading O
in O
the O
newspapers O
and O
listening O
to O
countless O
debates O
on O
the O
movie O
" O
The O
Passion O
" O
on O
television O
, O
I O
chose O
to O
go O
see O
it O
. O

When O
I O
left O
the O
movie O
hall O
, O
there O
was O
in O
me O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
a O
great O
desire O
to O
cry O
, O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O
shame O
for O
the O
so O
many O
words O
spent O
about O
the O
violence O
that O
spreads O
in O
the O
film O
. O

Words O
of O
indignation O
, O
words O
that O
scream O
to O
scandal O
, O
words O
that O
invite O
and O
induce O
not O
to O
attend O
. O

It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
violence O
is O
significantly O
present O
in O
the O
film O
, O
but O
only O
those O
who O
watch O
without O
faith O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
stopping O
at O
it O
. O

The O
scenes O
of O
pain O
find O
meaning O
and O
hope O
in O
the O
constant O
presence O
of O
Mary B-PER
, O
who O
first O
recognizes O
, O
accepts O
and O
supports O
what O
Jesus B-PER
lives O
in O
His O
Passion O
. O

The O
suffering O
of O
the O
Mother O
is O
immense O
, O
but O
in O
some O
way O
she O
manages O
not O
to O
make O
the O
viewer O
lose O
the O
connection O
with O
Love O
and O
Heaven O
. O

Beautiful O
is O
also O
the O
figure O
of O
the O
Cyrenius O
who O
, O
helping O
Jesus B-PER
to O
carry O
the O
Cross O
and O
almost O
embracing O
him O
under O
the O
weight O
he O
shares O
with O
Him O
, O
seems O
to O
give O
voice O
to O
a O
humanity O
that O
also O
knows O
how O
to O
love O

the O

The O

among O
those O

of O

that O
it O

right O
to O
express O

there O

nothing O

They O

If O
we O

that O
days O

the O

could O

It B-PER
is O
not O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
without O
having O
to O
do O
so O
, O
but O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
without O
having B-ORG
to I-ORG
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
have O
been O
able O
to O
find O
out O
who O
is O
supporting O
Pietro B-PER
Matteotti I-PER
’s O
candidacy O
. O

In O
the O
past O
few O
days O
there O
were O
more O
“ O
no O
” O
than O
“ O
yes O
” O
, O
not O
least O
those O
of O
the O
last O
hours O
signed O
by O
coalition O
partners O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
the O
human O
body O
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
the O
human O
body O
. O

And O
on O
behalf O
of O
Pietro B-PER
Matteotti I-PER
he O
earned O
a O
“ O
yes O
” O
decided O
, O
however O
already O
officially O
expressed O
on O
other O
occasions O
by O
numerous O
exponents O
of O
the O
automotive O
world O
. O

It B-PER
’s O
a O
great O
time O
for O
you O
to O
know O
what O
you O
’re O
going O
to O
do O
. O

The O
meeting O
is O
crucial O
, O
or O
at O
least O
it O
should O
be O
. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
decide O
whether O
to O
continue O
supporting O
Matteotti B-PER
or O
to O
prefer O
the O
coalition O
and O
break O
the O
civic O
. O

The O
first O
hypothesis O
, O
in O
the O
present O
state O
of O
affairs O
, O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
most O
plausible O
, O
the O
least O
painful O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
it O
should O
also O
be O
known O
what O
Riva B-ORG
Tomani I-ORG
decided O
that O
gathered O
its O
management O
last O
night O
for O
a O
definitive O
clarification O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
there O
is O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
chances O
that O
RD B-ORG
will O
run O
alone O
with O
Enzo B-PER
Bassetti I-PER
mayor O
candidate O
but O
not O
sure O
to O
count O
and O
think O
about O
agreements O
for O
the O
second O
round O
. O

“ O
If O
Matteotti B-PER
is O
not O
well O
now O
, O
he O
will O
not O
be O
well O
even O
in O
June O
, O
” O
Nino B-PER
Torboli I-PER
said O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
, O
but O
also O
unlikely O
, O
that O
the O
choice O
Matteotti B-PER
hijacked O
Ds B-ORG
, O
Greens B-ORG
and O
Democratic B-ORG
Project I-ORG
to O
Riva B-ORG
Tomani I-ORG
. O

It O
would O
remain O
difficult O
to O
understand O
for O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
vote O
in O
Bassetti B-PER
and O
also O
for O
the O
Greens B-ORG
who O
in O
May O
' O
99 O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
to O
openly O
say O
" O
no O
" O
to O
the O
affiliation O
in O
the O
second O
round O
with O
Riva B-ORG
Domani I-ORG
. O

But O
in O
politics O
everything O
is O
changing O
, O
and O
even O
more O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
this O
, O
you O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so O
. O

For O
that O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O

it O

This O

what O

then O

I O
disagree O

It O
is O
disgusting O
to O
read O
letters O
like O
the O
one O
that O
appeared O
on O
Sunday O
January O
12 O
on O
the B-ORG
Adige I-ORG
, O
which O
invited O
teachers O
to O
give O
less O
tasks O
to O
their O
students O
, O
a O
letter O
that O
did O
not O
spare O
ironic O
and O
free O
arrows O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
tasks O
, O
it O
is O
an O
irresolvable O
question O
, O
since O
those O
that O
for O
some O
are O
too O
many O
, O
for O
others O
are O
too O
few O
, O
for O
the O
lady O
who O
wrote O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
what O
the O
tasks O
are O
and O
what O
function O
they O
have O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
work O
that O
is O
assigned O
at O
home O
is O
neither O
a O
punishment O
nor O
a O
sadistic O
pleasure O
of O
teachers O
( O
since O
they O
must O
then O
correct O
what O
is O
done O
by O
the O
students O
) O
, O
but O
a O
way O
to O
deepen O
and O
internalize O
the O
knowledge O
provided O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
in O
the O
short O
time O
available O
at O
school O
, O
to O
which O
not O
only O
the O
instruction O
but O
also O
the O
education O
of O
the O
boys O
( O
once O
a O
family O
task O
) O
is O
delegated O
. O

In O
any O
activity O
it O
is O
only O
with O
constant O
commitment O
and O
exercise O
that O
good O
results O
are O
achieved O
. O

No O
one O
is O
surprised O
if O
athletes O
, O
for O
example O
, O
are O
required O
hours O
and O
hours O
of O
daily O
training O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
tasks O
also O
serve O
to O
empower O
young O
people O
in O
hiring O
and O
carrying O
out O
a O
commitment O
. O

There O
comes O
the O
legitimate O
suspicion O
that O
all O
these O
criticisms O
are O
due O
to O
the O
increasingly O
shorter O
time O
that O
parents O
are O
willing O
to O
devote O
to O
the O
education O
of O
their O
children O
, O
following O
them O
and O
helping O
them O
in O
the O
study O
, O
and O
to O
the O
poor O
consideration O
that O
many O
give O
to O
school O
and O
the O
work O
of O
teachers O
, O
preferring O
TV O
and O
computer O
as O
their O
convenient O
substitutes O
. O

Often O
families O
do O
not O
even O
find O
five O
minutes O
to O
justify O
in O
writing O
, O
as O
good O
education O
would O
require O
, O
the O
failure O
to O
perform O
tasks O
. O

Considering O
that O
there O
are O
many O
teachers O
who O
dedicate O
themselves O
with O
passion O
to O
a O
work O
that O
has O
become O
increasingly O
difficult O
, O
it O
would O
be O
pleasant O
, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
to O
read O
even O
a O
few O
letters O
of O
appreciation O
. O

The O
P.S. O

Maybe O
the O

not O
aware O
that O
today O
the O

are O
being O
brushed O
back O
from O

I O
learn O
from O
the B-ORG

the O
Sun B-ORG

that O
the O
working O
president O
has O
increased O
the O
taxes O
on O
the O
treatment O
of O
the O
end O
of O
the O
relationship O
and O
it O
is O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
bribes O
but O
of O
a O
few O
million O
that O
the O
workers O
will O
have O
to O
pay O
more O
. O

I O
have O
a O
doubt O
: O

It O
is O
not O
that O
this O
increase O
in O
taxes O
on O
the O
TFR O
serves O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
what O
a O
provincial O
employee O
wrote O
on O
the B-ORG
Adige I-ORG
, O
also O
to O
increase O
the O
pensions O
of O
those O
“ O
poor O
” O
pensioners O
who O
receive O
150 O
million O
and O
more O
years O
of O
old O
liras O
? O

I O
think O
so O
because O
since O
1 O
January O
2003 O
there O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
2 O
% O
solidarity O
tax O
on O
pensions O
above O
80.392,00 O
euros O
annually O
. O

This O
means O
that O
those O
who O
, O
for O
example O
, O
received O
£ O
150 O
million O
of O
annual O
pension O
paid O
, O
until O
December O
31 O
, O
2002 O
, O
a O
solidarity O
tax O
of O
£ O
3 O
million O
annually O
. O

Now O
that O
pensioner O
, O
no O
longer O
having O
to O
pay O
that O
tax O
, O
will O
find O
himself O
in O
his O
pocket O
3 O
million O
pounds O
more O
per O
year O
. O

If O
Tremonti B-PER
& O
Co. O
really O
needed O
money O
, O
why O
did O
they O
not O
extend O
the O
2 O
% O
solidarity O
tax O
on O
pensions O
exceeding O
£ O
150 O
million O
annually O
instead O
of O
ticking O
the O
ordinary O

? O

Those O
with O

of O
more O
than O

The O
deceitful O

No O
to O
global O
flags O
, O
yes O
to O
possible O
peace O
and O
security O
. O

The O
comparisons O
and O
events O
of O
these O
days O
have O
further O
strengthened O
the O
motives O
that O
have O
led O
me O
to O
a O
respectful O
but O
convinced O
criticism O
of O
the O
inspirers O
of O
the O
rainbow O
flags O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
in O
order O
to O
promote O
a O
serious O
culture O
of O
peace O
, O
which O
is O
connected O
with O
a O
firm O
protection O
of O
security O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
manipulation O
of O
reality O
that O
the O
Leftists O
have O
organized O
. O

These O
have O
sought O
, O
even O
in O
a O
recent O
television O
broadcast O
, O
to O
deny O
the O
flag O
’s O
belonging O
to O
integralist O
and O
“ O
no O
global O
” O
pacifism O
, O
claiming O
a O
presumed O
transversality O
of O
the O
same O
. O

That O
this O
constitutes O
a O
clear O
deception O
for O
citizens O
in O
good O
faith O
, O
however O
, O
is O
demonstrated O
by O
the O
recent O
political O
convention O
of O
the O
“ O
popular O
- O
communist O
” O
duo O
Cofferati B-PER
Moretti B-PER
, O
where O
the O
arc O
- O
boat O
flags O
triumphed O
everywhere O
as O
a O
symbol O
of O
a O
well O
- O
determined O
and O
identifiable O
political O
movement O
. O

Other O
than O
transversal O
appeal O
to O
values O
, O
this O
is O
a O
shameful O
instrumental O
appropriation O
of O
a O
universal O
value O
, O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
Italian O
Left O
. O

This O
is O
a O
real O
confrontation O
with O
those O
who O
feed O
different O
political O
ideas O
, O
but O
also O
with O
those O
citizens O
, O
including O
those O
of O
the O
left O
, O
who O
in O
good O
faith O
have O
exposed O
the O
flags O
, O
which O
have O
become O
of O
discord O
. O

I O
speak O
of O
manipulation O
of O
reality O
also O
in O
reference O
to O
the O
attempt O
to O
represent O
a O
Trentino B-LOC
rainbow O
just O
because O
7000 O
or O
10,000 O
flags O
would O
have O
been O
sold O
to O
a O
population O
of O
about O
four O
hundred O
thousand O
inhabitants O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
data O
is O
partial O
and O
therefore O
not O
easily O
verifiable O
, O
I O
want O
to O
remind O
readers O
that O
an O
objective O
look O
at O
our O
houses O
is O
enough O
to O
reduce O
the O
size O
of O
a O
fake O
“ O
trentino O
miracle O
” O
. O

One O
can O
indeed O
rejoice O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
having O
stimulated O
an O
“ O
ad O
hoc O
” O
reflection O
has O
caused O
some O
useless O
flags O
to O
be O
ripped O
, O
but O
it O
has O
above O
all O
increased O
the O
deeper O
meaning O
of O
the O
value O
of O
Peace O
, O
distracting O
it O
from O
a O
serious O
instrumental O
use O
for O
political O
purposes O
. O

I O
therefore O
call O
on O
the O
Leftists O
to O
be O
more O
loyal O
and O
tolerant O
towards O
those O
who O
allow O
themselves O
to O
criticize O
and O
unmask O
their O
actions O
. O

The O
Right O
has O
motivatedly O
revealed O
the O
true O
meaning O
of O
such O
flags O
, O
but O
it O
has O
always O
done O
so O
respectfully O
and O
constructively O
. O

The O
so O
- O
called O
pacifists O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
have O
demonstrated O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
letters O
sent O
to O
Adige B-ORG
, O
how O
much O
resentment O
and O
intolerance O
they O
nourish O
for O
the O
non O
- O
aligned O
, O
called O
“ O
fascists O
” O
only O
because O
they O
had O
the O
courage O
not O
to O
bend O
their O
heads O
in O
the O
face O
of O
an O
obvious O
, O
instrumental O
and O
deceptive O
mystification O
of O
reality O
. O

To O
say O
this O
with O
Gustavo B-PER
Selva I-PER
, O
these O
pacifists O
“ O
go O
down O
on O
the O
square O
, O

They O

The O

is O
the O

the O

immediately O
following O
the O

of O

May. O

In O
addition O
, O
a O
" O
atypical O

is O
added O
to O
the O
technical O

i.e. O
a O
man O

in O

In O

It O

as O
it O

also O
obvious O
that O
it O
is O
, O
especially O
the O
perspective O

that O

out O

at O

for O

. O

Time O
will O
tell O
the O
truth O
, O
but O
the O
contribution O
will O
be O
substantial O
. O

It O
will O
be O
on O
two O
fronts O
: O

It O
is O
the O
one O
inside O
the O
party O
, O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
larger O
office O
of O
local O
, O
and O
the O
one O
outside O
, O
the O
most O
important O
. O

The O
rumors O
circulating O
with O
insistence O
in O
recent O
hours O
indicate O
Tanas B-PER
as O
an O
authoritative O
candidate O
, O
if O
not O
the O
most O
authoritative O
( O
at O
least O
politically O
) O
, O
for O
one O
of O
the O
presidencies O
of O
the O
companies O
controlled O
by O
the O
Commune B-LOC
, O
a O
party O
that O
will O
inevitably O
open O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
have O
been O
able O
to B-ORG
get O
to O
know O
what O
is O
happening O
. O

It O
’s O
a O
very O
“ O
uncomfortable O
” O
place O
. O

But O
in O
this O
sense O
of O
confirmation O
today O
neither O
the O
shadow O
, O
but O
less O
the O
direct O
concerned O
. O

If O
Tanas B-PER
takes O
a O
step O
back O
, O
Margherita B-ORG
confirms O
in O
the O
joint O
exit O
mayor O
Paolo B-PER
Matteotti I-PER
who O
won O
his O
" O
personal O
battle O
" O
for O
a O

in O
the O

precisely O
with O
those O
skills O
( O
public O
works O

, O
as O

as O
the O

) O
until O
a O

owned O
by O

Pietro B-PER

The O
opening O
of O
the O
loan O
? O

It O
’s O
true O
, O
but O
we O
’ll O
see O
later O
. O

As O
long O
as O
it O
has O
not O
disappeared O
. O

It O
’s O
a O
big O
deal O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
a O
big B-PER
deal I-PER
to O
do O
. O

What O
if O
the O
Ds B-ORG
resorted O
to O
the O
Tar B-ORG
and O
had O
to O
raise O
it O
for O
the O
question O
of O
the O
dubious O
votes O
? O

Marino B-PER
can O
still O
remain O
in O
the O
joint B-ORG
as O
" O
outside O
" O
, O
the O
place O
is O
theoretically O
insured O
, O
armored O
. O

“ O
We O
’re O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
this O
at O
the O
right O
time O
, O
” O
said O
Mayor O
Molinari B-PER
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
will O
be O
essentially O
a O
problem O
of O
the O
sub O
- O
entry O
in O
the O
council O
, O
i.e. O
of O
counselor O
Morena B-PER
Galas I-PER
, O
before O
the O
unelected O
after O
Zambotti B-PER

In O
the O
first O

of O
the O
new O

scheduled O
for O
Wednesday O
afternoon O
( O
am O
17 O
) O
the O
majority O
will O
also O
be O
presented O
with O
three O
proposals O
for O
equal O
number O
of O
committees O
. O

Patrick B-PER
Lorenzi I-PER
( O
Margherita B-ORG
) O
for O
urban O
planning O
, O
Giovanni B-PER
Santoni I-PER
( O
Italian B-ORG
Communists I-ORG
) O
for O
social O
activities O
, O
Carlo B-PER
Daves I-PER
( O
Ds B-ORG
, O
at O
the O
time O
he O
will O
have O
replaced O
Adalberto B-PER
Mosaner I-PER
) O
for O
the O
commission O
on O
the O
review O
of O
the O
Municipal O
Statute O
and O
the O
rules O
of O
the O
council O
. O

The O
first O
consideration O
that O
comes O
naturally O
is O
that O
the O
appeal O
lacks O
the O
committee O
on O
participated O
companies O
, O
wanted O
by O
the O
council B-ORG
during O
the O
legislature O
of O
Cesare B-PER
Malossini I-PER
and O
confirmed O
by O
the O
executive O
Matteotti O
. O

“ O
The O
municipal B-ORG
council I-ORG
is O
sovereign O
, O
” O
commented O
Molinari B-PER
, O
who O
advocated O
the O
specific O
competence O
for O
himself O
, O
“ O
but O
I O
personally O
consider O
a O
constant O
circulation O
of O
information O
at O
the O
conference O
of O
the O
heads O
of O
groups O
more O
productive O
. O
” O

We O
do O
not O
put O
our O
hands O
on O
the O
fire O
, O
but O
thinking O
of O
a O
confirmation O
from O
the O
commission O
in O
question O
seems O
therefore O
unrealistic O
. O

This O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
world O
’s O
economy O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Heavily O
anchored O
in O
the O
center O
, O
with O
a O
deputy O
mayor O
such O
as O
Mosaner B-PER
( O
Ds B-ORG
) O
strong O
but O
apparently O
isolated O
. O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
century O
, O
the O
world O
’s O
largest O
and O
most O
famous O
cities O
were O
located O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
in O
the O
southern O
part O
of O
the O
country O
. O

But O
from O
the O
birth O
and O
composition O
of O
this O
junta O
also O
derives O
a O
political O
consideration O
that O
concerns O
especially O
the O
Margherita B-ORG

These O
dissidents O
, O
headed O
by O
the O

former O
deputy O

, O
who O
have O
never O
hidden O
their O
desire O
for O
a O
“ O

and O
a O

are O
supported O
by O

No O
indulgence O

by O
Bruno B-PER
Giardina I-PER

No O
indulgence O
, O
according O
to O
the O
prosecutor O
Bruno B-PER
Giardina I-PER
Isabella B-PER
Agostini I-PER
deserves O
the O
sentence O
to O
the O
maximum O
penalty O
. O

The O
judge O
who O
had O
conducted O
the O
investigation O
into O
the O
crime O
of O
Terlago B-LOC

then O
supported O
the O
public O
accusation O
in O
the O
audience O

in O
his O
appeal O

he O
reviewed O
step O
by O
step O
the O
entire O
trial O
and O
- O
in O
a O
70 O
- O
page O
act O
- O
highlighted O
all O
those O
that O
in O
his O
opinion O
were O
the O
contradictions O
in O
which O
the O
court O
fell O
. O

According O
to O
the O
prosecution O
, O
the O
sentence O
should O
have O
been O
much O
heavier O
because O
the O
judges O
would O
have O
had O
to O
recognize O
the O
prevalence O
of O
the O
contested O
aggravators O
: O

Cruelty O
, O
futile O
motives O
and O
above O
all O
premeditation O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
a O
human B-PER

. O

“ O
What O

to O

Sanction O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
recognition O
of O
the O
existence O
of O

It B-PER
is O
also O
critical O
of O
the O
procedural O
attitude O
held O
by O
the O
accused O
, O
noting O
that O
Isabella B-PER
“ O

held O
a O

It O

will O
give O
a O

to O
his O
painting O
through O
a O
cultural O
training O
linked O
to O
the O
French O
painters O
of O
the O
Second O
Empire O

During O
his O
long O
existence O

he O
dies O
at O
97 O
, O
continues O
to O
deepen O
visions O
rooted O
in O
the O
culture O
of O
the O
late O
Eighth O

and O
remains O
always O
faithful O
to O
the O
poetry O
of O
the O
real O

elaborated O
in O

youth O
, O
without O
letting O
himself O
be O
involved O
by O
the O
innovations O

It O
remains O

apart O

linked O
to O
the O
true O
and O
thus O
lives O
in O
a O
century O
that O
“ O
escapes O
him O
for O
philosophical O
and O
aesthetic O
premises O
” O
. O

Its O
landscapes O
represent O
mostly O
scenes O
of O
peasant O
life O
always O
accompanied O
by O
an O
intense O
feeling O
for O
nature O
that O
becomes O
a O
spokesman O
for O
the O
unceasing O
passage O
of O
time O
, O
the O
daily O
succession O
of O
events O
. O

The O
most O
intense O
season O
in O
the O
activity O
of O
Fornara B-PER
goes O
from O
1891 O
to O
1897 O
, O
years O
of O
evolution O
resulting O
in O
the O
overcoming O
of O
the O
canons O
assimilated O
by O
the O
lesson O
of O
Horses B-PER
and O
the O
rethinking O
of O
subjects O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
passes O
from O
the O
portrait O
to O
the O
whole O
figure O
, O
from O
the O
dead O
nature O
, O
deepened O
especially O
during O
the O
stay O
in O
Lyon B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
gender O
scenes O
. O

He O
departs O
from O
the O
portrait O
and O
landscape O
fine O
to O
themselves O
and O
in O
a O
short O
time O
acquires O
a O
bright O
palette O
and O
a O
picturesque O
space O
no O
longer O
unified O
, O
but O
made O
through O
flat O
fittings O
that O
block O
the O
movement O
of O
the O
figure O

He O
spent O
most O
of O
his O
years O
, O
excluding O
the O
lucky O
stages O
in O
Lyon O
and O
Paris O
at O
a O
very O
young O
age O
and O
then O
the O
participation O
in O
the O
most O
important O
national O
and O
international O
exhibitions O
, O
however O
only O
until O
1922 O
, O
in O
the O
isolation O
of O
the O
Vigezzo B-LOC
valley I-LOC
away O
from O
those O
he O
himself O
defines O
“ O
the O
ephemeral O
modes O
among O
which O
the O
modern O
soul O
waves O
” O
. O

Nature O
is O
the O
main O
source O
of O
inspiration O
, O
a O
nature O
that O
is O
not O
that O
heroic O
depicted O
by O
Segantini B-PER
, O
of O
which O
he O
assimilated O
the O
lesson O
without O
however O
being O
a O
slave O
of O
his O
vision O
. O

The O
summer O
transhumans O
, O
such O
as O
Fontanalba B-LOC
of O
1904 O
/ O
1908 O
, O
which O
want O
to O
be O
, O
precisely O
, O
a O
tribute O
to O
Segantini B-PER
, O
are O
works O
of O
great O
breath O
in O
which O
often O
the O
acid O
colors O
return O
the O
rare O
mountain O
light O
without O
being O
faithful O
to O
the O
real O
ones O
. O

There O
are O
also O
allusive O
references O
to O
the O
Segantinian O
concept O
of O
the O
time O
, O
which O
, O
however O
, O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
twilight O
, O
but O
the O
great O
solitude O
of O
the O
climbing O
, O
interrupted O
only O
by O
the O
whirling O
of O
the O
cow O
. O

With O
Segantini B-PER
Fornara B-PER
comes O
into O
contact O
thanks O
to O
the O
intervention O
of O
Grubicy B-PER
that O
will O
make O
him O
“ O
employ O
” O
from O
Segantini B-PER
himself O
as O
an O
assistant O
for O
the O
Panorama O
of O
the O
Engadina O
work O
that O
he O
was O
preparing O
for O
the O
Exposition O
Universelle O
. O

If O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
this O
will O
represent O
a O
fortune O
for O
Fornara B-PER
on O
the O
other O
, O
it O
will O
also O
create O
numerous O
misunderstandings O
for O
the O
developments O
of O
his O
art O
. O

He O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
although O
rich O
in O
an O
academic O
background O
that O
Segantini B-PER
did O
not O
have O
and O
open O
to O
a O
modernist O
vision O
of O
French O
footprint O
, O
poses O
toward O
the O
master O
in O
a O
non O
- O
paritarian O
attitude O
, O
almost O
of O
psychological O
subordination O
. O

A O
burdensome O
confrontation O
for O
him O
that O
will O
turn O
from O
veneration O
to O
worship O
after O
Segantini B-PER
’s O
sudden O
and O
tragic O
death O
, O
less O
than O
a O
year O
after O
their O
relationship O
began O
. O

It O
will O
become O
even O
more O
difficult O
for O
him O
to O
separate O
himself O
from O
the O
master O
’s O
message O
also O
because O
Alberto B-PER
Grubicy I-PER
will O
invest O
him O
in O
the O
role O
of O
“ O
Segantinian O
heir O
of O
mountain O
poetry O
” O
. O

But O
the O
high O
mountain O
landscapes O
of O
Fornara B-PER
have O
“ O
a O
sharpness O
and O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
peaceful O
serenity O
that O
does O
not O
find O
a O
reflection O
in O
the O
work O
of O
Segantini B-PER
” O
. O

Divisionism O
is O
used O
to O
give O
the O
work O
a O
particular O
brightness O
. O

His O
lives O
are O
not O
places O
in O
the O
mind O
, O
but O
places O
where O
he O
has O
actually O
lived O
since O
his O
childhood O

The O
Dellai B-PER
backbone O
does O
not O
take O
you O
far O
( O
following O
from O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
note O
that O
, O
if O
you O
are O
interested O
in O
the O
use O
of O
the O
product O
, O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
use O
the O
product B-ORG
for O
the O
purposes O
described O
in O
this O
section O
. O

I O
was O
then O
defeated O
because O
I O
supported O
the O
need O
that O
the O
current O
majority O
if O
it O
really O
wanted O
to O
carry O
forward O
a O
policy O
of O
reforms O
should O
" O
recompose O
" O
with O
the O
center O
of O
Valduga B-PER
Giovanazzi B-PER
and O
Conci B-PER
and O
should O
re O
- O
establish O
an O
organic O
and O
strategic O
alliance O
with O
the O
Patt B-ORG
. O

I O
was O
directly O
, O
grossly O
, O
accused O
by O
Betta B-PER
, O
now O
a O
senator O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
, O
and O
indirectly O
by O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Dellai O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
, O
of O
being O
a O
supporter O
of O
the O
“ O
revolt O
” O
by O
comparing O
myself O
to O
the O
worst O
figures O
in O
the O
political O
landscape O
. O

In O
that O
case O
, O
I O
was O
accused O
of O
wanting O
to O
keep O
the O
PPI B-ORG
alive O
instead O
of O
aiming O
at O
its O
liquidation O
to O
give O
birth O
to O
Margherita B-ORG
. O

And O
now O
, O
in O
Rome B-LOC
, O
those O
who O
supported O
this O
thesis O
have O
" O
closed O
" O
with O
the O
National O
Margherita B-ORG
to O
give O
birth O
to O
an O
autonomous O
group O
of O
any O
senators O
in O
the O
name O
of O
safeguarding O
autonomy O
. O

But O
the O
autonomy O
is O
saved O
, O
if O
they O
believe O
it O
, O
by O
the O
big O
regiments O
and O
not O
by O
seven O
or O
eight O
senators O
. O

And O
on O
that O
occasion O
, O
finally O
, O
it O
was O
shouted O
to O
the O
four O
winds O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
junta B-ORG
would O
never O
be O
touched O
and O
that O
it O
would O
brilliantly O
end O
the O
legislature O
. O

However O
, O
it O
did O
not O
take O
long O
to O
understand O
that O
without O
a O
majority O
in O
the O
legislative O
committees O
, O
without O
numbers O
in O
the O
provincial B-ORG
council I-ORG
and O
with O
a O
political O
climate O
between O
opposition O
and O
majority O
suffering O
( O
in O
some O
respects O
understandably O
) O
from O
the O
violence O
suffered O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
legislature O
and O
without O
political O
forces O
capable O
of O
independently O
seeking O
a O
progressive O
reconstitution O
became O
a O
chimera O
to O
think O
of O
a O
government O
capable O
of O
initiating O
a O
reformist O
march O
. O

Now O
the O
president O
of O
the O
provincial B-ORG
junta I-ORG
and O
leader O
of O
the O
Margherita B-ORG
nostrana O
, O
as O
far O
as O
one O
can O
intuit O
from O
journalistic O
interpretations O
, O
is O
attentive O
to O
what O
happens O
in O
the O
Center O
and O
in O
what O
remains O
of O
the O
Patt B-ORG
after O
the O
expropriation O
suffered O
by O
this O
party O
, O
thanks O
also O
to O
his O
initiative O
, O
with O
the O
invention O
of O
the O
Genziane B-ORG
. O

Better O
late O
than O
never O
, O
says O
an O
old O
adage O
. O

But O
does O
this O
“ O
reflection O
” O
serve O
to O
“ O
remove O
” O
a O
political O
framework O
, O
or O
does O
it O
serve O
to O
solve O
some O
personal O
issues O
, O
or O
does O
it O
simply O
serve O
Dellai B-PER
to O
stay O
firm O
in O
his O
place O
and O
ensure O
a O
re O
- O
candidacy O
as O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
outgoing O
coalition O
? O

Probably O
the O
truth O
is O
a O
confectionery O
that O
contains O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
. O

But O
whatever O
the O
outcome O
of O
this O
path O
is O
, O
it O
is O
far O
too O
obvious O
that O
the O
“ O
crisis O
” O

It O
is O
more O
profound O
and O
would O
be O
a O
big O
mistake O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
future O
fate O
of O
the O
center O
- O
left O
, O
to O
limit O
it O
to O
just O
the O
joint O
structure B-ORG
. O

If O
they O
do O
n’t O
return O
to O
the O
parties O
. O

( O
and O
not O
to O
the O
purely O
personal O
movements O
) O
the O
task O
of O
redesigning O
a O
path O
for O
the O
future O
of O
this O
earth O
will O
hardly O
be O
able O
to O
give O
a O
response O
to O
the O
current O
political O
crisis O
. O

The O
risk O
is O
that O
the O
whole O
thing O
will O
be O
brought O
back O
to O
a O
question O
of O
numbers O
and O
therefore O
to O
a O
sort O
of O
“ O
market O
” O
of O
advisors O
. O

And O
the O
even O
greater O
risk O
is O
that O
, O
by O
playing O
a O
few O
words O
, O
you O
solve O
the O
political O
crisis O
simply O
by O
giving O
a O
response O
only O
on O
the O
plane O
of O
numbers O
. O

And O
one O
can O
not O
even O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
people O
and O
parties O
interested O
in O
this O
removal O
, O
forget O
what O
has O
happened O
in O

In O
other O
words O

there O
are O
some O
“ O
titles O
” O
of O
topics O
that O
should O
be O
further O
explored O
. O

Who O
has O
worked O
for O
the O
destruction O
of O
the O
parties O
, O
who O
has O
preached O
the O
primacy O
of O
the O
new O
for O
the O
new O
, O
who O
considers O
the O
sole O
depository O
of O
power O
( O
regardless O
of O
the O
process O
that O
determines O
it O
) O
the O
institutional O
data O
, O
who O
has O
made O
the O
generational O
belief O
a O
political O
data O
, O
who O
has O
interpreted O
, O
even O
on O
the O
plane O
of O
the O
management O
of O
power O
, O
all O
this O
, O
can O
be O
the O
future O
interpreter O
of O
a O
political O
phase O
that O
to O
be O
solid O
must O
be O
based O
on O
a O
re O
- O
legitimation O
of O
the O
role O
and O
function O
of O
the O
parties O
? O

And O
those O
political O
forces O
, O
especially O
of O
the O
Center O
, O
which O
today O
are O
concerned O
or O
are O
pushed O
or O
attracted O
by O
a O
government O
experience O
weaken O
or O
strengthen O
the O
role O
they O
could O
have O
in O
the O
future O
? O

It O
is O
more O
useful O
electorally O
, O
also O
considered O
the O
national O
wave O
, O
to O
be O
" O
homogenized O
" O
by O
the O
current O
leadership O
, O
or O
it O
might O
be O
more O
useful O
to O
work O
on O
a O
provincial O
political O
structure O
that O
gives O
the O
political O
forces O
their O
autonomy O
, O
their O
dignity O
even O
within O
a O
coalition O
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
possibility O
of O
having O
a O
less O
conditioned O
role O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
legitimate O
personal O
ambitions O
also O
come O
into O
play O
here O
, O
but O
a O
party O
, O
slowly O
and O
with O
a O
capacity O
for O
persuasion O
, O
should O
make O
a O
design O
less O
connected O
to O
the O
contingent O
prevail O
also O
because O
it O
does O
not O
necessarily O
represent O
a O
resource O
. O

It O
can O
be O
a O
problem O
. O

Then O
on O
the O
carpet O
there O
is O
a O
broader O
discourse O
concerning O
the O
strategy O
, O
coupled O
, O
of O
course O
, O
with O
the O
content O
, O
which O
the O
center O
- O
left O
will O
have O
to O
elaborate O
to O
repel O
the O
center O
- O
right O
attack O
. O

A O
question O
to O
which O
it O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
give O
an O
answer O
, O
but O
if O
a O
chance O
of O
success O
exists O
, O
this O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
rooting O
of O
political O
forces O
, O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
recovery O
of O
some O
lines O
that O
have O
been O
“ O
reference O
points O
” O
for O
thousands O
of O
people O
and O
that O
someone O
has O
cut O
with O
too O
much O
superficiality O
and O
cynicism O
. O

Certainly O
in O
these O
years O
the O
national O
and O
local O
political O
and O
institutional O
framework O
has O
undergone O
profound O
changes O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
that O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
this O
land O
are O
all O
emigrated O
to O
the O
Maldives B-LOC
and O
it O
is O
not O
even O
true O
that O
Trentino B-LOC
has O
suffered O
an O
invasion O
or O
was O
occupied O
by O
aliens O
who O
imposed O
a O
new O
way O
of O
being O
and O
thinking O
. O

Now O
, O
after O
the O
storms O
of O
novalism O
at O
all O
costs O
( O
but O
the O
time O
should O
also O
pass O
for O
those O
who O
have O
made O
novism O
an O
ideology O
! O
) O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
resume O
the O
difficult O
work O
of O
a O
recovery O
of O
the O
political O
taste O
that O
is O
based O
on O
a O
just O
separation O
, O
which O
does O
not O
mean O
indifference O
, O
between O
political O
engagement O
in O
the O
parties O
, O
in O
the O
movements O
in O
the O
associations O
and O
political O
engagement O
in O
the O
institutions O
. O

It O
should O
be O
recalled O
that O
confusion O
is O
never O
useful O
for O
the O
consolidation O
of O
a O
fatiguing O
participatory O
democracy O
, O
but O
rather O
it O
is O
shortcuts O
behind O
which O
only O
gaps O
remain O

I O
followed O
on O
the O
newspaper O
“ O
L’Adige B-ORG
” O
the O
various O
interventions O
on O
“ O

e O

, O
which O
already O
qualify O
by O
the O
title O
, O
obviously O
in O
line O
with O
today O
’s O
language O
, O
and O
by O
the O
evanescence O
of O
the O
signatures O

“ O
I O
am O
fully O
aware O
that O
today O
there O
are O
much O
more O
serious O
problems O
on O
our O
planet O
and O
even O
in O
the O
small O
“ O

” O
of O
the O
time O
( O
see O
in O
Italy B-LOC
and O
in O
Trentino B-LOC

, O
I O
wonder O
if O
the O
degradation O
of O
the O
school O
does O
not O
have O
its O
great O
part O
of O
responsibility O
, O
as O
far O
as O
Italy B-LOC
is O
concerned O
, O
in O
all O
that O
is O
violent O
and O
antidemocratic O
everywhere O
. O

In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
century O
, O
the O
world O
’s O
most O
famous O
cities O
were O
located O
in O
the O
northern O
part O
of O
the O
country O
, O
and O
the O
world O
’s O
most O
famous O
cities O
were O
located O
in O
the O
southern O
part O
of O
the O
country O
. O

And O
not O
even O
in O
the O
merit O
of O
the O
very O
questionable O
reforms O
that O
we O
have O
suffered O
in O
the O
continuous O
approach O
of O
ministers O
to O
the O
public B-ORG
education I-ORG
. O

But O
I O
would O
like O
to O
strongly O
deny O
the O
repeated O
and O
unfounded O
accusations O
of O
“ O
unacceptable O
and O
obvious O
injustice O
” O
of O
which O
teachers O
would O
be O
blamed O
: O

Just O
as O
I O
deny O
that O
their O
working O
hours O
are O
less O
than O
the O
hours O
of O
other O
workers O
, O
just O
because O
the O
working O
hours O
are O
distributed O
differently O
, O
as O
I O
deny O
all O
the O
hateful O
resentment O
that O
continues O
to O
be O
expressed O
by O
many O
students O
( O
and O
often O
even O
parents O
) O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
public O
opinion O
against O
the O
teaching O
class O

In O
every O
context O
of O
human O
society O
there O
are O
honest O
people O
and O
dishonest O
people O
, O
engaged O
workers O
, O
skilled O
and O
correct O
in O
the O
face O
of O
unengaged O
workers O
, O
fools O
and O
opportunists O
. O

In O
the O
very O
delicate O
field O
of O
teaching O
, O
the O
teaching O
of O
the O
necessary O
notions O
should O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
educational O
function O
, O
which O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
" O
roffianery O
" O
, O
but O
not O
even O
with O
the O
widespread O
permissivism O
today O
in O
fashion O
. O

No O
one O
is O
infallible O
, O
some O
assessment O
can O
be O
wrong O

some O
unworthy O
teacher O
can O
also O
commit O
favoritisms O

however O
very O
widespread O
in O
the O
world O
of O
politicians O
and O
entrepreneurship O
much O
more O
than O

This O
does O
not O
justify O
the O
absurd O
and O
slanderous O
claims O
that O
students O
and O
families O
cast O
impunely O
and O
indiscriminately O
against O
the O
teaching O

If O
only O
in O

it O
was O
imposed O
a O
little O
less O
laxism O
and O
a O
little O
more O
commitment O

if O
it O
was O
allowed O
a O
little O

( O
from O
the O
impoverishment O
of O
discoteques O
to O
the O
unrestrained O
use O
of O

and O
young O
people O
would O
be O
stimulated O
to O
a O
more O
serious O
application O

if O
a O
little O
less O

if O

a O
little O
less O
indulgence O

a O
little O
more O

I O
would O
remove O

Arabic O
Dar O

the O

his O
blessing O

supported O
by O
the O
new O

Bolzano B-LOC

Trento B-LOC
of O
Durnwalder B-PER

Dellai B-PER
. O

He O
gave O
me O
two O
warnings O
. O

The O
first O
is O
to O
“ O
not O
extend O
too O
much O
the O
organs O
of O
public O
administrations O
” O
. O

It O
is O
like O
saying O
: O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
multiply O
public O
spending O
unnecessarily O
, O
creating O
a O
plethora O
of O
bureaucratic O
affairs O
( O
temptation O
from O
which O
the O
two O
provinces O
and O
the O
region B-LOC
themselves O
are O
not O
immune O
) O
. O

And O
the O
other O
warning O
is O
that O
the O
new O
phase O
of O
autonomy O
should O
give O
room O
to O
civil O
society O
. O

It O
means O
, O
in O
Ciampi B-PER
’s O
words O
, O
“ O
space O
for O
the O
energies O
of O
the O
private O
sector O
, O
allowing O
it O

the O

to O
take O
over O

the O

And O
now O
, O
after O
giving O
definitive O
burial O
to O
the O
old O
Region B-LOC

there O
is O
no O

The O
sign O
, O
undoubtedly O
, O
that O
the O
“ O
conspirators O
” O
want O
to O
take O
it O
seriously O
. O

The O
“ O
conjurers O
” O
are O
the O
builders O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
future O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
which O
they O
strongly O
want O
, O
despite O
the O
perplexities O
, O
the O
brakes O
and O
sometimes O
the O
squats O
that O
come O
from O
the O
national O
summits O
of O
Ds B-ORG
and O
Margherita B-ORG
, O
not O
so O
convinced O
of O
dissolving O
the O
old O
nomenclatures O
and O
sailing O
into O
an O
unknown O
sea O

After O

soon O
found O
the O
taste O
of O
active O
politics O
and O
became O
the O
local O

and O
one O
of O
the O
national O
landmarks O
of O

Eighty O

Italy B-LOC
( O
only O
, O
for O

reasons O
, O
the O
Calabria O

, O
among O
the O
present O
also O
the O
former O

Franco B-PER
Bassanini I-PER
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
convinced O
supporters O
of O
the O

, O
along O
with O
Gianmario B-PER
De I-PER
Muro I-PER
and O
the O
professor O
of O

Giovanni B-PER
Guzzetta I-PER
( O
ex O

in O
Trento B-LOC
) O
who O
presented O
the O
question O
for O
the O
future O
referendum O
on O
the O
electoral O
law O
that O
the O
" O
democrats O
" O
intend O
to O
launch O
in O
great O
style O
, O
whether O
the O
parties O
will O
not O
respond O
to O
their O
call O
for O
a O
change O
- O
again O
in O
the O
majority O
sense O
- O
of O
an O
electoral O
law O
" O
disgraceful O
and O
antidemocratic O
" O
. O

To O
return O
to O
the O
uninominal O
colleges O
, O
both O
for O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
for O
the O
Senate B-ORG
, O
without O
more O
than O
25 O
% O
of O
proportionality O
of O
the O
old O
Mattarellum O
, O
is O
the O
goal O
of O
the O
association O
. O

But O
there O
is O
a O
second O
big O
topic O
on O
which O
the O
carbonarians O
of O
the O
PD B-ORG
are O
preparing O
a O
large O
mobilization O
: O

A O
strong O
proposal O
on O
the O
democratic O
arrangement O
of O
the O
parties O
( O
reported O
yesterday O
by O
professors O
Alessandro B-PER
Mangia I-PER
and O
Cesare B-PER
Pinelli I-PER
) O
, O
not O
only O
to O
fill O
the O
“ O
hole O
” O
of O
what O
is O
not O
said O
in O
Article O
49 O
of O
the O
Constitution O
( O
“ O
All O
citizens O
have O
the O
right O
to O
freely O
associate O
themselves O
in O
parties O
to O
compete O
with O
democratic O
method O
to O
determine O
national O
policy O
” O
) O
, O
but O
to O
finally O
give O
a O
turn O
in O
a O
participatory O
sense O
to O
Italian O
politics O
. O

“ O
There O
is O
a O
deficit O
of O
democracy O
in O
the O
parties O
, O
” O
explains O
Kessler B-PER
, O
“ O
so O
we O
think O
of O
a O
popular O
law O
initiative O
, O
not O
just O
proposed O
to O
the O
center O
- O
left O
voters O
, O
that O
deals O
with O
the O
node O
of O
transparent O
financing O
of O
the O
parties O
, O
which O
must O
agree O
to O
submit O
to O
internal O
democracy O
standards O
, O
valid O
for O
all O
, O
starting O
with O
the O
selection O
of O
candidates O
through O
regulated O
primaries O
. O
” O

The O
third O
ground O
of O
commitment O
of O
the O
Association B-ORG
for I-ORG
the I-ORG
PD I-ORG
is O
of O
course O
the O
path O
towards O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
a O
human B-PER
being O
. O

“ O
The O
warmth O
– O
to O
use O
an O
euphemism O
of O
Ds B-ORG
and O
Margherita B-ORG
– O
does O
not O
cool O
us O
, O
rather O
it O
prompts O
us O
to O
give O
us O
a O
strong O
dimension O
, O
” O
explains O
Kessler B-PER
, O
who O
thus O
illustrates O
the O
ideal O
time O
ladder O
: O

“ O
Prodi B-PER
convenes O
parties O
and O
associations O
in O
October O
2006 O
, O
we O
present O
ourselves O
and O
then O
we O
further O
strengthen O
ourselves O
at O
the O
national O
level O
, O
the O
parties O
make O
their O
congresses O
in O
spring O
2007 O
, O
and O
in O
October O
of O
the O
next O
year O
, O
second O
anniversary O
of O
the O
primaries O
for O
Prodi B-PER
, O
each O
region O
could O
elect O
their O
representatives O
in O
the O
constituent O
of O
the O
new O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
without O
network O
, O
with O
the O
vote O
of O
the O
members O
of O
the O
parties O
that O
will O
be O
as O
valid O
as O
that O
of O
the O
new O
members O
of O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
who O
will O
sign O
a O
promising O
declaration O
of O
intent O
. O

The O
winner O
among O
us O
will O
be O
the O
one O
who O
knows O
how O
to O
move O
more O
. O
” O

Will O
they O
let O
you O
do O
it O
, O
Fassino B-PER
Rutelli B-PER
& O
C O
? O

“ O
It O
will O
not O
be O
easy O
, O
” O
Kessler B-PER
replies O
, O
“ O
it O
will O
not O
happen O
spontaneously O
, O
but O
if O
we O
know O
how O
to O
mobilize O
ourselves O
, O
in O
the O
end O
the O
parties O
will O
understand O
that O
they O
will O
have O
to O
stay O
there O
if O
they O
want O
to O
be O
followed O
by O
the O
base O
. O
” O

In O
addition O
to B-PER
this O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
this O
is O
a O
very O
important O
part O
of O
the O
life O
of O
the O
human B-PER
body I-PER
. O

After O
dinner O
in O
Santa B-LOC
Massenza I-LOC
. O

This O
morning O
we O
concluded O
with O
a O
final O
report O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
Sardinia B-LOC
will O
not O
become O
the O
“ O
Bolognina O

of O
a O
new O
