already O

This O
operation O
separates O
the O

making O
it O

Monami I-PER
- O
Van O

against O
the O

She O
noticed O
that O
she O
usually O
only O
wept O
on O

But O
together O
with O
her O
husband O
Bart B-PER
Van I-PER
Roost I-PER
she O
overcame O
that O
dark O
period O
, O
and O
at O
the O

against O

the O
stops O
went O
through O
: O
Dominique B-PER
Monami I-PER

Van O

burst O
into O
sobs O
at O
the O
first O
innocent O

And O
then O
all O
that O
happened O
on O
her O

However O
, O
Dominique B-PER
Monami I-PER
- O
Van O
Roost O
was O
not O
so O
excited O
about O
the O
help O
from O
above O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
actually O
have O
100 O
% O
time O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
next O

. O

For O
a O
long O

I O
was O

I O

like O
to O
speak O
of O
a O

But O
yes O
, O
if O
Roland B-MISC

is O
the O
only O
missing O

You O

to O

such O
moments O

The O
hangover O
came O
yesterday O
: O
disabled O
by O
the O
noble O
unknown O
Spanish B-MISC
Marta B-PER

after O

Also O
my O
storage O
was O
not O
perfect O
last O
week O
, O
but O
by O
doing O
a O
certain O
movement O
differently O
, O
this O
small O
technical O
problem O
was O
solved O
in O
a O
few O

, O
so O
that O
my O

ended O
up O

Prophetic O
words O

pale O

This O
was O
my O

But O
that O

In O
the O
better O
second O
half O
of O
the O
lost O
game O
against O
Finland B-LOC

the O
drop O
too O
much O
for O
Georges B-PER
Leekens I-PER
-- O
Strupar B-PER

all O

from O

against O

Netherlands B-LOC
the O

was O
back O
on O
track O
for O
the O
Red B-ORG
Devils I-ORG
. O

Even O
now O
it O
is O
far O
from O
being O
said O
that O
Strupar B-PER
is O
also O
starting O
against O
Sweden B-LOC
, O
because O
the O
league O
coach O
has O
Strupar B-PER
showing O
up O
for O
conditional O
reasons O
: O
" O
Everyone O
saw O
in O
Spa B-LOC
last O
week O
that O
Strupar B-PER
was O
not O
yet O
on O
a O
conditional O
level O
. O

More O
than O
Strupar B-PER
has O
Nilis B-PER
international O
experience O
, O
he O
also O
knows O
how O
to O
whack O
the O
whip O
at O
big O
tournaments O
-- O
although O
the O
memory O
of O
the O
World O
Championship B-MISC
of O

will O
taste O
particularly O
harsh O
to O
him O

So O
the O
shape O
of O
the O
moment O
, O
and O
perhaps O
also O
fate O
, O
will O
have O
to O
make O
the O
difference O
. O

But O
where O
for O
most O
positions O
the O
hierarchy O
is O
very O
clear O
-- O
so O
Marc B-PER
Wilmots I-PER
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
has O
to O
be O
half O
- O
dead O
before O
Johan B-PER
Walem I-PER
gets O
his O
chance O
-- O
there O
's O
one O
post O
where O
one O
balances O
on O
a O
very O
weak O
cord O
to O
tell O
the O
difference O
. O

In O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
general O
public O
, O
Nilis B-PER
has O
lost O
some O
credit O
on O
the O
national O
team O
due O
to O
all O
the O
troubles O
surrounding O
his O
return O
. O

But O
like O
Strupar B-PER
, O
he O
's O
not O
the O
fastest O
-- O
a O
lack O
that O
analysts O
rub O
his O
nose O
in O
order O
not O
to O
count O
him O
among O
the O
' O
world O
spits O
' O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
his O
last O
interlands O
against O
Portugal B-LOC
and O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
he O
made O
a O
fleeting O
impression O
. O

Waseige B-PER
about O
Strupar B-PER
: O
' O
It O
is O
not O
on O

says O
Waseige B-PER

' O
, O
as O
they O
are O
provided O
for O
in O
the O
new O
agreement O
, O
this O
just O
principle O
is O
completely O
thrown O
overboard O
. O

In O
concrete O
terms O
, O
in O
my O
case O
, O
I O
will O
earn O
about O
15,000 O
francs O
net O
each O

from O
50 O
years O
onwards O
, O
less O
than O
most O
of O
my O
peers O
for O
the O
same O
work O
. O

I O
do O
not O
doubt O
the O
right O
of O
our O
Buddhist O
compatriots O
to O
apply O
for O
this O
recognition O
, O
as O
the O
Constitution O
and O
the O

of O
1870 O
made O
that O
possible O
and O
made O
it O
possible O

If O
there O
is O
such O
a O

pot O
( O
those O

will O
be O
many O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
costs O
) O
to O
distribute O
in O
our O
sector O
, O
then O
everyone O
should O
get O
their O
fair O
share O
of O
it O
and O
that O
does O
not O
happen O
now O
anyway O
. O

Use O
that O
money O
for O
initiatives O
for O
the O
integration O
of O
foreign O
cultures O
, O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
multicultural O
society O
. O

I O
quote O
: O
" O
It O
is O
true O
that O
the O

is O
not O
accessible O
to O

I O

, O
I O
fear O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O

Therefore O
, O
for O

only O
then O
switch O

Are O

not O

such O

about O

The O

Before O

The O

already O
in O

for O
much O
higher O

Their O

can O
be O
pushed O
forward O
or O
backwards O
, O
while O
they O
can O
also O
be O
folded O
down O
or O
removed O
relatively O
easily O
. O

The O
theoretical O
average O
of O
9.5 O
liters O
per O
kilometer O
seems O
to O
confirm O
this O
, O
but O
during O
our O
test O
drive O
we O
did O
get O
a O
much O
higher O
figure O
of O
12.5 O
and O
with O

even O
almost O
14 O

In O

are O

you O
would O

expected O

on O
the O

Those O

are O

you O
can O
loosen O
them O
and O
then O
fasten O
them O
in O
the O

That O
at O
the O

time O
daring O

beautiful O
design O
is O
also O
found O

a O

The O

That O
defect O
in O
the O
gene O
is O
not O
a O
disease O
, O
it O
is O
normal O
in O
some O
of O
the O
Hampshire B-MISC
pigs I-MISC
, O
such O
as O
a O
shorter O
or O
longer O
tail O
. O

Because O
during O
their O
lives O
the O
pigs O
are O
fitter O
and O
thicker O
, O
but O
if O
their O
meat O
is O
cooked O

you O
have O
less O
left O
than O
a O

The O

a O

But O
we O

The O
meat O
is O
also O
slightly O
sourer O
, O
holds O
less O

thus O
loses O
a O

if O

make O

The O

also O
not O

in O

We O

that O
the O

When O
we O

saw O
that O
they O
had O
three O
times O
more O

that O

In O

For O
him O

We O
then O
drink O
two O

and O
feel O
the O

coming O
back O

On O
a O

easy O

falls O
heavily O
on O
his O

Most O
drive O
in O
groups O
, O
as O
recommended O
, O
personally O
we O
drive O
both O
alone O
and O
when O
it O
becomes O
really O
dangerous O
, O
along O
with O
some O
others O
. O

Whoever O
thinks O

Never O
before O

go O
so O
fast O

And O
then O
there O
's O
an O
annoying O

that O
we O
do O

That O

is O

tell O
you O

too O
, O
it O
is O
accepted O
that O

Perhaps O
so O
do O
her O

The O
only O
thing O
you O

The O

of O
the O
Opec B-ORG
to O
increase O
production O
by O
700,000 O

is O

that O
this O
high O

will O
certainly O
be O
maintained O
in O
the O
short O

page O

However O
, O
the O
low O
reserves O
also O
play O
a O
significant O
role O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
seems O
unlikely O
that O
supply O
will O
increase O
significantly O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
. O

This O
record O
level O
can O
be O
explained O
by O
several O
factors O
. O

While O
these O
small O
increases O
in O
production O
can O
not O
appeal O
to O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
population O
, O
oil O
values O
are O
supported O
by O
the O
increase O
in O
oil O
prices O
. O

During O
the O
summer O
a O
number O
of O
refineries O
will O
be O
repaired O
and O
inspected O
. O

We O
recommend O
the O
following O
values O
: O
TotalFina B-ORG

Royal B-ORG
Dutch I-ORG
, O
Coflexip B-ORG

BP B-ORG

However O
, O
it O
is O

the O

that O
can O
benefit O
most O

At O

do O

the O

" O

' O
The O
answer O
was O
quickly O
found O
. O

Maybe O
that O
brings O
something O
up O
with O
the O
bobos O
of O
Dutch B-MISC
football O
. O
" O

They O
put O
the O
book O
aside O
. O

Laughing O
maybe O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
Frank B-PER
de I-PER
Boer I-PER
walk O
into O
that O
first O
penalty O
kick O
, O
I O
saw O
right O
away O
that O
it O
was O
wrong O
. O

But O
that O
it O
's O
not O
even O
being O
watched O
? O

" O
The O
Dutch B-MISC
are O
entangled O
at O
Big B-MISC
Football I-MISC
Moments I-MISC
. O

I O
found O
that O
the O
Orange B-ORG
is O
a O
well O
- O
run O
company O
that O
lacks O
something O
terribly O
important O
in O
terms O
of O
efficiency O
. O

76 O
% O
. O

So O
he O
thought O
: O
it O
has O
to O
be O
high O
. O

Penal O
kick O
for O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
in O
the O
very O
last O
minute O
. O

That O
's O
very O
deep O
in O
the O
head O
. O

In O
1970 O
, O
the O
Fifa B-ORG
entered O
the O
shoot O
- O
out O
. O

Every O
now O
and O
then O
he O
wakes O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
from O
a O
dream O
he O
had O
for O
the O
first O
time O
as O
a O
13 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
boy O
. O

With O
that O
data O
in O
mind O
, O
it O
is O
not O
sustainable O
to O
, O
like O
Johan B-PER
Cruijff I-PER
: O
' O
Punishment O
kicks O
, O
that O
is O
not O
football O
, O
that O
is O
psychology O
and O
you O
can O
not O
train O
on O
that O
. O
' O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
" O
he O
sighs O
. O

That O
was O
like O
a O
rowing O
team O
appearing O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
Olympic B-MISC
Games I-MISC
without O
oars O
. O

Like O
the O
one O
that O
gently O
swirled O
his O

, O
just O
before O
he O
printed O
: O
pure O

Yeah O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
the O
book O
's O
gon O
na O
sell O
well O
by O
now O
. O

" O
Not O
even O
leafed O
. O
" O

Then O
you O
feel O
that O
everyone O
is O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
a O
fundamental O
question O
or O
need O
. O

Four O
on O
five O
. O
" O

If O
there O
was O
one O
moment O
in O

history O
that O
showed O
that O
it O
was O
n't O
a O

who O

But O
getting O
rid O
of O
his O
Africa B-MISC
policy I-MISC
as O
a O
mere O

is O
all O
too O
simplistic O
. O

And O
that O
attitude O
is O
beginning O
to O
bear O
fruit O
, O
albeit O
very O
slowly O
. O

Slowly O
because O
people O

not O
used O
to O

sinking O
to O
the O

without O

. O

It O
is O
certain O
that O
the O
CVP B-ORG
believes O
that O
Michel B-PER
is O
primarily O
pursuing O
his O
Africa B-MISC
policy I-MISC
to O
glorify O
his O
own O
person O
. O

edition O

But O
many O
Congolese B-MISC
people I-MISC
will O
interpret O
his O
second O
visit O
to O
Kinshasa B-LOC
as O
a O
return O
of O
' O
l'oncle B-PER
belge I-PER
' O
, O
which O
will O
now O
finally O
put O
things O
right O
. O

It O
may O
all O
seem O
like O
neither O
meat O
nor O
fish O
, O
but O
by O
resolutely O
choosing O
one O
or O
the O
other O
party O
, O
Michel B-MISC
's I-MISC
role O
as O
mediator O
would O
have O
been O
played O
out O
immediately O
. O

By O
understanding O
the O
security O
problems O
of O
Rwanda B-LOC
and O
Uganda O
, O
the O
door O
remains O
open O
. O

Whether O
he O
does O
so O
to O
get O
into O
the O
history O
books O
or O
from O
his O
concern O
for O
the O
poor O
Congolese B-MISC
, O
we O
will O
be O
very O
happy O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Belgium B-LOC
remains O
the O
main O
trading O
partner O
of O
Congo B-LOC
, O
but O
as O
an O
importing O
country O
, O
Congo B-LOC
is O
only O
on O
the O
28th O
, O
as O
an O
exporting O
country O
in O
the O
62nd O
place O
. O

Now O
Louis B-PER
Michel I-PER
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
most O
modest O
minister O
in O
the O
Belgian B-MISC
government O
. O

This O
was O
contrary O
to O
the O
policy O
adopted O
by O
the O
then O
government O
with O
regard O
to O
Kabila B-PER
, O
and O
ultimately O
did O
not O
serve O
anyone O
's O
interests O
unless O
Hasquin B-PER
himself O
. O

So O
remains O
the O
possibility O
that O
Michel B-PER
, O
partly O
from O
his O
personal O
discovery O
of O
Africa B-LOC
during O
his O

Similarly O

This O
can O
be O
done O

that O

That O
would O
be O
a O
real O
miracle O

As O
expected O
, O
Fidel B-PER
Castro I-PER
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Street B-LOC
of I-LOC
Florida I-LOC
refused O
to O
cooperate O
in O
such O
a O
radical O
scenario O
, O
and O
chose O
to O
portray O
the O
boy O

lost O

kidnapped O

severely O
battered O

Do O
the O

Miami B-LOC

hate O
more O
than O
they O
love O
Elián B-PER

Just O
a O

I O
admit O
that O
both O
developments O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
divided O
Cuban B-MISC
nation O
only O
have O
a O
very O
small O
chance O
of O
success O
. O

For O
example O
, O
there O
are O
books O
that O
Elián B-PER
and O
his O
school O
friends O
will O
never O
be O
able O
to O
read O
, O
masterpieces O
of O
Cuban B-MISC
authors O
in O
exile O
for O
example O
, O
such O
as O
Cabrera B-PER
Infante I-PER

Reynaldo B-PER
Arenas I-PER

After O
an O
extremely O
moving O
stay O
of O
six O
months O
in O
America B-LOC
, O
the O
Cuban B-MISC
refugee O
Elián B-PER
Gonzalez I-PER
is O
back O
in O
his O
native O
country O
. O

Do O
they O
not O
have O
the O
right O
to O
decide O
for O
themselves O
what O
is O
dangerous O
, O
what O
is O
critical O
, O
what O
is O
counter O
- O
revolutionary O
? O

The O
distant O
relatives O
in O
Miami B-LOC
who O
took O
care O
of O
him O
during O
his O
first O
months O
and O
now O
have O
to O
give O
him O
up O
permanently O
could O
initiate O
this O
process O
by O
calling O
for O
an O
end O
to O
the O
blockade O
against O
Cuba B-LOC

But O
it O
takes O
brave O
steps O

For O
the O
past O
seven O
months O
, O
all O
the O
time O
since O
he O
managed O
to O
escape O
the O
treacherous O
sea O
off O
the O
coast O
of O
Florida B-LOC

he O
has O
been O
constantly O
immersed O
in O
turbulent O
waters O
of O
a O
very O
different O
species O
, O
a O
rapidly O
rising O
tide O
of O
incessant O
symbolism O
that O
has O
forced O
the O

him O

the O

It O
would O
of O

be O

that O
he O

that O
the O

so O
delicate O
that O
the O

so O

insufficient O

But O
he O
would O

call O
the O

Nico B-PER
carried O
his O

out O

them O

Freddy B-PER
started O
screaming O

He O
looked O
at O
his O
son O

white O
feet O
that O
were O
sticking O
out O
under O
the O
sheet O

It O
reminded O
him O
of O

had O
spent O
together O

He O
stood O
still O
in O
the O

Even O
now O

She O
led O
his O
overwhelming O
erection O
into O
her O
warm O
tunnel O

then O
laid O
her O
hands O
on O
his O

. O

" O
I O
ca O

sobbed O
Marianne B-PER

They O
both O
dressed O
up O
silently O

" O
No O

said O
Marianne B-PER

It O
did O

sound O

For O
minutes O
they O
looked O
down O
on O
what O
was O
left O
of O
their O
son O

" O
I O
'll O
go O

said O
Marianne B-PER
, O
who O
also O
got O
up O
. O

Although O
it O
did O
n't O
make O
sense O
, O
he O
could O
n't O
do O
anything O
for O
Freddy B-PER

he O
still O

over O

of O

Another O
news O
I O
would O

liked O
to O
announce O
was O
that O
we O

I O
ca O
n't O
talk O

I O

Seghers B-PER

a O

The O

There O
is O
a O

those O
on O
capital O
: O
more O
taxes O

such O

The O

that O

That O

is O
that O

another O

I O
'll O
do O
it O
again O
, O
that O
flying O
, O
" O
I O
say O
now O
to O
whom O
else O
is O
bothering O
me O
. O

Soon O
, O
however O
, O
I O
find O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
fear O
of O
flying O
are O
wool O
- O
painted O
air O
travelers O
, O
most O
of O
whom O
have O
dozens O
of O
flights O
on O
their O
activities O

That O

what O
I O
'm O
thinking O

" O
Take O
the O

again O

A O
culture O
of O
mercury O
, O
which O
has O
splashed O
out O
of O
a O
fever O
thermometer O
and O
is O
now O
being O
chased O
by O
collective O
horror O
vacui O
. O

At O
that O
moment O
the O
other O
students O
are O
already O
hanging O
high O
in O
the O
air O
, O
while O
we O
are O
grinning O
behind O
. O

Now O
I O
expected O
to O
find O
among O
the O
participants O
mainly O
people O
who O
had O
even O
flown O
. O

The O
stewardesses O
are O
an O
Indian B-MISC
girl O
with O
teeth O
that O
shine O
like O
the O
Taj B-LOC
Mahal I-LOC
, O
and O
a O
young O
blonde O
fairy O
whose O
hair O
sparkles O
like O
a O
frozen O
glacier O
. O

Never O
fly O
again O

' O
Here O
we O
go O
- O
ho O
' O
, O
it O
would O
have O
roared O
just O
before O
taking O
off O
through O
the O
intercom O
. O

There O
are O
even O
people O
who O
are O
on O
the O
guided O
flight O
in O
the O
clouds O
, O
but O
the O
first O
time O
after O
that O
hardly O
dare O
to O
get O
in O
' O

" O
But O
there O
is O
still O
so O
much O
delicious O
to O
see O
in O
Europe B-LOC

" O

And O
I O
could O
finally O
see O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
flash O
it O
through O
my O
head O
, O
or O
go O
in O
Africa B-LOC
looking O
for O
the O
places O
where O
my O
father O
lived O
... O

Meanwhile O
, O
I O
find O
out O
that O
no O
less O
than O
two O
in O
three O
people O
suffer O
from O
fear O
of O
flying O
. O

So O
hard O
even O
that O
my O
hands O
were O
hurting O
and O
that O
I O
, O
arriving O
on O
the O
spot O
, O
immediately O
bent O
over O

to O
plan O
a O
way O
back O

It O
is O
one O
like O
before O
in O
school O
, O
which O
you O
can O
roll O
on O
a O
stick O
, O
with O
the O
inscription O
Carte O

A O
lot O
of O
progress O
, O
he O
found O
himself O
, O
because O
the O
then O
available O
cards O
were O
not O
only O
expensive O
, O
even O
folded O
up O
they O
were O
too O
big O
to O
store O
them O
somewhere O
decent O
. O

The O
perspective O
is O
cosmic O
, O
but O
not O
distant O
: O
you O
feel O
involved O
as O
a O
human O
being O
. O

The O
marbles O
shot O
under O
her O
heels O
in O
all O
directions O
and O
the O
lady O
could O
just O
be O
caught O
by O
bystanders O
before O
she O
hit O
the O
ground O
. O

Do O
n't O
immediately O
think O
that O
this O
Kircher B-PER
was O
a O
half O
- O
assed O
quack O
, O
by O
no O
means O
: O
this O
particularly O
erudite O
spirit O
was O
considered O
in O
the O
seventeenth O
century O
as O
a O
leading O
physicist O
, O
mathematician O
, O
biologist O
, O
philosopher O
and O
orientalist O
. O

And O
if O
one O
were O
to O
separate O
the O
five O
foliobands O
, O
based O
on O
the O
projection O
of O
Mercator B-PER
, O
one O
could O
construct O
a O
gigantic O
globe O
, O
" O
according O
to O
Küng B-MISC
's I-MISC
description O
of O
the O
atlas O
of O
Vander B-PER
Maelen I-PER
. O

The O
artist O
does O
so O
by O
means O
of O
a O
rotating O
mirror O
reflecting O
a O
light O
source O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
work O
of O
Mona B-PER
Hatoum I-PER
has O
that O
little O
bit O
more O
that O
knocks O
you O
out O
of O
your O
mind O
. O

" O
It O
is O
quickly O
inclined O
to O
assume O
that O
every O
oeuvre O
of O
a O
visual O
artist O
already O
represents O
a O
world O
in O
itself O
, O
" O
writes O
Küng B-PER
. O

In O
his O
oeuvre O
, O
the O
artist O
highlights O
the O
indifferent O
but O
very O
complex O
microworld O
of O
insects O
and O
beetles O
. O

No O
one O
makes O
that O
common O
, O
time O
transcending O
spirit O
in O
Orbis B-MISC

feel O
better O
than O
the O
Brussels B-MISC

celestial O
maps O
illustrated O
Cellarius B-PER
in O
the O

Fabre B-PER
is O
particularly O
fascinated O
by O
the O
scarabs O
, O
also O
called O
dung O
beetles O
or O

, O
which O
were O
sacred O

for O
the O
ancient O

not O

the O

Finally O
, O
that O
is O
the O
image O
that O
the O
chemist O
has O
of O
the O

although O
we O
all O
prefer O
to O
stick O
to O
the O
familiar O

It O
is O
the O
merit O

by O
Guido B-PER

, O
although O
this O
Swiss B-MISC

is O
closer O
to O

actuality O

This O
Gentian B-MISC

puts O
out O
the O

in O

that O
the O

by O
Philippe B-PER
Vander I-PER
Maelen I-PER
is O
almost O
a O
conceptual O
work O
. O

author O

The O
artist O
has O
replaced O
the O
l O
and O
the O
i O
of O
the O
word O
' O

with O
an O
é O
and O
thus O
made O

Her O
procedure O
is O
as O
often O
subtle O

impressive O

Like O

Whether O
the O

her O

edition O

It O
is O
striking O
, O
however O
, O
that O
Küng B-PER
has O
made O
considerable O
use O
of O
Swiss B-MISC
artists O
in O
the O
composition O
of O
his O
exhibition O
and O
has O
overlooked O
some O
obvious O
choices O
. O

A O
lady O
stepped O
in O
, O
had O
n't O
seen O
the O
little O
islands O
outside O
the O
door O
. O

Some O
artists O
take O
on O
a O
more O
modest O
attitude O
and O
portray O
their O
perceptions O
and O
experiences O
of O
daily O
reality O
as O
modern O
cartographers O
. O

In O
1577 O
the O
Antwerp B-MISC
print O
publisher O
Philip B-PER
Galle I-PER
published O
the O
maps O
from O
the O
Theatrum B-MISC
in O
reduced O
form O
with O
texts O
written O
in O
verses O
. O

Also O
his O
contemporary O
Andreas B-PER
Cellarius I-PER
must O
have O
been O
a O
very O
well O
- O
read O
man O
, O
but O
he O
seems O
rather O
a O
celestial O
stormer O
than O
an O
alchimistic O
digger O
to O
unknown O
soil O
treasures O
. O

" O
All O
the O
maps O
of O
his O
atlas O
are O
displayed O
on O
the O
same O
scale O
, O
so O
that O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
area O
shown O
, O
e.g. O
a O
desert O
or O
an O
ocean O
, O
almost O
blank O
pages O
can O
be O
seen O
. O

The O
audience O
shared O
his O
opinion O
, O
because O
in O
the O
same O
year O
a O
new O
edition O
of O
' O
the O
theatre O
of O
the O
world'appeared O
. O

The O
mental O
distance O
between O
the O
authors O
of O
the O
exhibited O
works O
is O
, O
despite O
the O
centuries O
that O
separate O
them O
, O
very O
small O
. O

His O
embroidered O
world O
map O
, O
of O
which O
eight O
different O
versions O
exist O
, O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
colourful O
patchwork O

Almost O
that O
happened O
literally O
during O
my O
visit O
to O
the O
room O
where O
Hatoum B-PER
made O
a O
world O
map O
with O
an O
innumerable O
number O
of O
glass O
marbles O
. O

Five O

The O
famous O
atlas O
of O
Ortelius B-PER
' O
contemporary O
Mercator B-PER
was O
initially O
not O
so O
popular O
, O
but O
his O
projection O
method O
is O
still O
being O
used O
. O

That O
finding O
conceals O
the O
unspoken O
view O
that O
this O
is O
not O
always O
the O
case O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the'diaries O
' O
of O
On B-PER
Kawara I-PER
, O
Christoph B-PER
Fink I-PER
can O
also O
be O
mentioned O
in O
this O
context O
. O

Actually O
, O
the O
work O
with O
the O
Hatoum B-PER
marbles O
is O
related O
to O
Broodthaers B-PER
' O
work O
. O

I O
had O
to O
laugh O
, O
not O
to O
gloat O
, O
but O
because O
with O
a O
careless O
misstep O
you O
could O
disrupt O
the O
world O
order O
. O

The O
work O
of O
Tuerlinckx B-PER
is O
not O
cartographic O
, O
there O
are O
no O
paper O
, O
laths O
and O
compasses O
, O
but O
it O
does O
relate O
in O
a O
sensual O
, O
indirect O
way O
to O
this O
earth O
as O
a O
celestial O
body O
in O
our O
solar O
system O
. O

I O
blinked O
with O
the O
eyes O
and O
saw O
in O
a O
flash O
all O
over O
the O
world O
disintegrating O
into O
colliding O
elementary O
particles O
, O
like O
atoms O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
of O
Orbis B-MISC
Terrarum I-MISC
hangs O
his O
famous O
colourful O
world O
map O
. O

The O
geopolitical O
reality O
created O
by O
this O
map O
has O
been O
transformed O
into O
a O
large O
poetic O
universe O
without O
borders O
by O
a O
small O
correction O
. O

However O
, O
Küng B-PER
has O
created O
a O
context O
that O
stimulates O
curiosity O
about O
this O
somewhat O
hermetic O
work O
. O

This O
appears O
especially O
in O
the O

Scholl B-PER
does O

and O
what O
the O
accompanying O

squared O

is O
the O
end O

technical O
perfection O

an O

that O
says O
more O

does O
indeed O

an O

a O

portion O

I O

you O
have O

it O
will O
not O

" O

" O
But O
at O
the O

time O
it O
's O
a O
story O
that O
dates O
back O
to O
ancient O
times O
when O
there O
were O
no O

You O
can O
approach O
such O
a O
situation O
in O
a O
very O
serious O
way O
or O
you O
can O
joke O
about O
it O
. O

" O
What O
appeals O
to O
me O
in O
the O
work O
of O
Faulkner B-PER
and O
García B-PER
Marquez I-PER
is O
that O
they O
do O
not O
use O
the O
real O
world O
. O

The O
result O
is O
a O
funny O
and O
colorful O
, O
excited O
and O
exciting O
combination O
of O
fairy O
tale O
and O

in O

Not O

therefore O
, O
that O

Does O
Khudojnazarov B-PER

from O

" O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
do O
understand O
why O
the O
comparison O
between O
Emir B-PER
and O
me O
is O
made O
. O

The O
story O
begins O
in O
a O
small O
village O
near O
Samarkand B-LOC
, O
where O
seventeen O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Mamlakat B-PER
dreams O
of O
a O
career O
as O
an O
actress O
. O

At O
least O
I O
'm O
not O
influenced O
by O
the O
Kusturica B-PER
movies O
, O
even O
though O
I O
think O
he O
's O
an O
excellent O
director O
. O

And O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
tragikomedie O
, O
therefore O
helped O
me O
make O
that O
decision O
. O
" O

When O
I O
tell O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
that O
his O
' O
fantastic O
realism O
' O
also O
has O
some O
affinity O
with O
what O
we O
in O
Belgium B-LOC
call'magical O
realism O
' O
, O
an O
art O
movement O
that O
can O
be O
found O
in O
our O
paintings O
, O
our O
literature O
and O
in O
our O
films O
, O
he O
spontaneously O
begins O
about O
a O
Belgian B-MISC

has O
seen O

story O

who O

One O
last O
question O
: O
why O
was O
Luna B-MISC
Papa I-MISC
dedicated O
to O
" O
our O
mothers O
" O
? O

This O
assignment O
is O
my O
way O
of O
thanking O
her O
for O
everything O
she O
's O
done O
for O
me O
. O

" O
For O
me O
, O
this O
is O
a O
real O
story O
, O
" O
emphasises O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
. O

I O
am O
much O
more O
influenced O
by O
literature O
, O
for O
example O
the O
novels O
of O
William B-PER
Faulkner I-PER
and O
Gabriel B-PER
García I-PER
Márquez I-PER
. O

Each O
artist O
makes O
his O
own O
country O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
they O
're O
laughing O
at O
psychology O
. O

Yet O
the O
result O
is O
not O
chaotic O
at O
all O
, O
because O
those O
who O
watch O
closely O
-- O
for O
example O
in O
the O
scene O
where O
a O
double O
- O
decker O
, O
a O
herd O
of O
running O
horses O
and O
one O
of O
the O
main O
characters O
are O
in O
the O
picture O
together O
-- O
must O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
has O
kept O
things O
well O
under O
control O
. O

But O
because O
there O
are O
not O
so O
many O
tragikomedies O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
directors O
who O
are O
active O
in O
the O
same O
genre O
are O
associated O
with O
each O
other O
. O

One O
night O

the O

intimately O
entangled O
couple O
slides O
down O

by O
the O

gives O
rise O
to O
a O
very O
strange O

free O

you O
can O
only O
make O

that O

why O
I O
'd O
rather O
leave O
him O
out O

And O
so O
it O
makes O
clear O
why O
the O

describes O
the O
colourful O
mixture O
of O

and O
imagination O
in O
Luna B-MISC

as O
' O

being O
dealt O
with O
in O
an O
ironic O
way O

Three O

about O

about O

about O

" O
That O

right O

What O
do O
you O
call O
that O
? O

It O
was O
the O
period O
of O
the O
perestroika O
: O
everything O
had O
to O
be O
free O
and O
so O
you O
could O
really O
do O
everything O

But O
he O
's O
decided O
something O
's O
coming O
out O
of O
that O
plane O

Another O
example O
of O
an O
economic O
paradox O
is O
that O
the O
great O

of O

some O

The O
architecture O
of O
this O
modern O
building O
has O
made O
a O
huge O
impression O
on O
me O
. O

Not O
at O
all O
. O

And O
frankly O
, O
that O
does O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
surprising O
. O

And O
three O
: O
the O
operation O
must O
be O
smooth O
and O
cordial O
. O

Reserve O
during O
the O
second O
shift O
. O

" O
Finally O
I O
mention O
the O
most O
beautiful O
restaurant O
I O
have O
visited O
so O
far O
: O
Perlan B-LOC
, O
on O
a O
mountain O
top O
just O
outside O
Reykjavik B-LOC

Iceland B-LOC

. O

Actually O
, O
I O
'm O
very O
loyal O
to O
certain O
restaurants O
. O

I O
think O
a O
restaurant O
must O
meet O
three O
conditions O
. O

Moreover O
, O
he O
is O
not O
shy O
about O
an O
extra O
effort O
if O
it O
benefits O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

edition O

So O
you O
can O
still O
get O
freshly O
cut O
and O
fried O

at O
Henri B-LOC
, O
the O
préparé O
à O

and O
the O

also O
prepared O

In O
summer O
you O
can O
table O
on O
the O
terrace O
, O
and O
that O
is O
of O
course O
a O
delight O
. O

The O
patron O
is O
someone O
who O
knows O
very O
well O
what O

The O
only O
drawback O
I O
can O
mention O
relates O
to O
the O
shifts O
: O
I O
like O
to O
stick O
when O
I O
feel O
the O
need O
for O
it O
, O
and O
that O
of O
course O
can O
not O
be O
done O
if O
you O
have O
reserved O
for O
the O

An O
astronomical O
amount O

that O

it O

whether O

Barragán B-PER
at O
that O

went O
looking O
for O
the O
elaboration O

of O
the O

according O
to O

These O

which O
give O

are O
all O

How O
great O
that O

was O

The O
huge O
plot O
went O
because O
of O
the O
barren O

unworkable O
soil O
almost O
for O

Monasteries O

were O
the O
structures O
that O
left O
their O
most O
obvious O
impressions O
on O
him O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
he O
has O
such O
a O
recognizable O
style O
is O
undoubtedly O
due O
to O
the O
large O
area O
that O
Barragán B-PER
could O
always O
build O
. O

Because O
the O
houses O
were O
always O
a O
variation O
on O
the O

theme O

we O
can O
speak O
of O
a O
clear O
Barragán B-MISC
style I-MISC

Barragán B-PER
also O
took O
care O
of O
its O
surroundings O

the O

had O

also O
soaked O
Barragán B-PER
of O
the O
importance O
of O
expressing O
the O
indigenous O

culture O
in O
his O
work O

There O
's O
a O
reason O
we O
did O
n't O
know O
him O
well O

In O

the O
Mexican B-MISC

Luis B-PER

died O
, O
and O
look O
: O
now O
the O
West B-LOC
wants O
to O
know O
everything O
about O
him O

In O
the O
early O
1940s O
, O
when O
Barragán B-PER
developed O
his O

he O
bought O

When O
he O
returned O

after O

made O

That O
the O

Later O
the O
men O
met O
, O
and O
Bac B-PER
would O
have O
inspired O
and O
encouraged O
Barragán B-PER
to O
intertwine O
architecture O
and O
natural O
environment O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O

As O
the O
years O
progressed O
, O
more O
and O
more O

was O
added O
. O

What O
makes O
the O
Mexican B-MISC
Barragán B-PER
attractive O
for O
the O
flat O

minimized O
West B-LOC
is O
that O
very O
distinct O
mix O
of O
modernism O
with O
local O
elements O
: O
the O
colors O
and O
the O
feeling O

This O
distinguishes O
his O
work O
forever O
from O
all O
other O
twentieth O
- O
century O
architectural O
achievements O
. O

So O
you O
should O
n't O
look O
for O
social O
commitment O
with O
this O
architect O
. O

Bac B-PER
felt O
that O
gardens O
should O
be O
" O
magical O
places O
for O

, O
" O
that O
they O
should O
have O
the O

to O
enchant O

Like O
the O
Portuguese B-MISC
Alvaro B-PER
Siza I-PER
, O
Luis B-PER
Barragán I-PER
has O
also O
succeeded O
in O
creating O
a O
mix O
: O
Mexican B-MISC
tradition O
linked O
to O
the O

That O
started O
right O

traveled O

At O

Not O
many O
details O
of O
his O
origins O
are O
known O

but O
we O
know O
that O
he O
originated O
from O
an O
aristocratic O
family O
, O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
a O
farm O
near O
the O
village O
of O
Mazamitla B-LOC
in O
Michoacan B-LOC
, O
a O
region O
known O
for O
its O
special O
indigenous O
architecture O
. O

It O
also O
meant O
that O
all O
facets O
of O
daily O
life O
were O
to O
be O
found O
in O
such O
a O
hacienda O
: O
birth O
, O
baptism O
and O
marriage O
, O
the O
fiestas O
and O
competitions O
, O
the O
bullfights O
and O
harvest O
parties O
. O

In O
the O
early O
1940s O
, O
Luis B-PER
Barragán I-PER
learned O
by O
looking O
at O
those O
friendships O
to O
his O
own O
country O
. O

For O
example O
in O
the O
house O
for O
the O
Engestrom B-PER
family O
: O
on O
this O
large O
estate O
the O
house O
is O
surpassed O
in O
beauty O
and O
poetic O
power O
by O
the O
part O
that O
is O
intended O
for O
the O
horses O
. O

Barragán B-PER
could O
carelessly O
surrender O
to O
an O
intellectual O
, O
artistically O
tinted O
existence O
full O
of O
formal O
poetry O
. O

Barragán B-PER
retained O
his O
parental O
hacienda O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
preference O
for O
space O
, O
and O
for O
typical O
Mexican B-MISC

In O
the O

They O
usually O
ask O

Many O
of O
these O

are O
very O

modest O
climber O
around O
a O

or O
wooden O
obelisk O
or O

It O

Pruning O
is O
not O
necessary O
unless O
occasionally O
to O
remove O
some O
dry O
or O
too O
thick O
branches O

Choose O
for O
such O
an O
application O
rather O
not O
too O
strong O
growing O
roses O
with O
smooth O
branches O
that O
can O
easily O

The O

are O
worthless O
as O
a O
support O
rack O
for O
roses O
( O
and O
for O
most O
climbing O
plants O
) O
. O

Ideally O
, O
every O
autumn O
, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
prune O
the O
bloomed O
branches O
down O
to O
a O
strong O
side O
shoot O
or O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
you O
must O
choose O
the O
roses O
according O
to O
the O
tree O
in O
which O
they O
must O
grow O
. O

Buy O
simple O
models O
, O
without O
too O
many O
tires O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
anymore O
when O
they O
are O
completely O
covered O
under O
the O
roses O
. O

Most O
climbing O
roses O
will O
enjoy O
it O
better O
anyway O
if O
they O
get O
some O
more O
space O
than O
against O
a O
wall O
and O
the O
wind O
is O
good O
on O
all O
sides O
. O

A O
very O
attractive O
way O
to O
use O
climbing O
roses O
is O
to O
grow O
an O
old O
( O
fruit O
) O
tree O
or O
a O
boring O
conifer O
. O

Such O
a O
rose O
support O
must O
be O
at O
least O
2.5 O
m O
high O
. O

That O
could O
be O
a O
pergola O
or O
a O
rosebow O
. O

Lian O
roses O
require O
little O
care O
, O
only O
they O
need O
to O
be O
tied O
almost O
permanently O
during O
the O
first O
years O
. O

Because O
of O
their O
slightly O
more O
controlled O
growth O
and O
their O
longer O
flowering O
, O
they O
are O
more O
appropriate O
for O
most O
gardens O
than O
the O
liana O
pinkers O
. O

Because O
of O
their O
enormous O
growth O
power O
-- O
some O
varieties O
grow O
more O
than O
four O
meters O
per O
season O
-- O
they O
're O
less O
suitable O
for O
a O
small O
garden O
. O

A O
rosebow O
or O
a O
pergola O
must O
of O
course O
be O
firm O
enough O
to O
carry O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
climbing O
roses O
in O
rain O
and O
wind O
, O
but O
some O
constructions O
seem O
rather O
destined O
to O

give O

a O
list O

my O
favorites O

There O
is O
no O
climbing O
plant O
that O
blooms O
as O
spectacularly O
and O
in O
such O
abundance O
of O
colors O
and O
smells O
as O
the O

Not O

the O

the O
bottom O

very O
dry O

in O

they O
are O
almost O
literally O
roasted O
on O
hot O
days O
in O
the O
summer O

The O
annual O
pruning O
is O
quite O
simple O
: O
the O
long O
growth O
branches O
should O
be O
removed O
regularly O
if O
there O
are O
too O
many O
and O
old O
, O
dead O
and O
poorly O
flowering O
branches O
should O
be O
removed O
. O

Between O
the O
poles O
you O
leave O
thick O
cords O
along O
which O
you O
lead O
the O
roses O
, O
so O
that O
you O
get O
a O
kind O
of O
roseguirlandes O
. O

This O
is O
usually O
not O
necessary O
in O
the O
first O
few O
years O
, O
but O
above O
all O
it O
is O
important O
to O
ensure O
a O
good O

the O

. O

For O
such O
an O
application O
you O
should O
use O
a O
liana O
rose O
whose O
long O
flexible O
branches O
can O
easily O
be O
rotated O
around O
the O
cords O
. O

But O
during O
flowering O
the O
effect O
is O
overwhelming O
. O

Along O
a O
garden O
path O
you O
can O
hit O
low O
poles O
in O
the O
ground O
of O
such O
a O
good O
meter O
high O
. O

You O
must O
always O
ensure O
that O
there O
is O
at O
least O
10 O
to O
15 O
cm O
space O
between O
the O
wall O
and O
the O
rose O
so O
that O
the O
wind O
can O
be O
behind O
it O
. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
do O
this O
, O
then O
the O
rose O
only O
grows O
in O
height O
and O
will O
also O
bloom O
only O
at O
the O
top O
, O
while O
the O
shrub O
at O
the O
bottom O
becomes O
completely O
bald O
. O

That O
may O
be O
difficult O
against O
a O
high O
wall O
or O
pergola O
or O
when O
they O
are O
standing O
among O
other O
plants O
. O

All O
climbing O
roses O
bloom O
best O
if O
their O
branches O
are O
led O
as O
horizontally O
as O
possible O
or O
in O
arcform O
. O

I O
have O
stood O
in O
my O
garden O
for O
example O
two O
New B-MISC
Dawns I-MISC
, O
one O
against O
a O
wall O
facing O
south O
, O
the O
other O
just O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
( O
for O
the O
time O
being O
) O
supported O
with O
some O
bamboo O
sticks O
in O
wigwam O
shape O
. O

General O

Also O
some O
of O
the O
old O
Wichuriana B-MISC
hybrids I-MISC
, O
such O
as O
' O
Albéric B-MISC
Barbier I-MISC
' O
and O
' O
Albertine B-MISC
' O
, O
have O
everything O
of O
a O
liana O
rose O
, O
but O
the O
flowers O
are O
bigger O
and O
they O
bloom O
a O
second O
time O
in O
autumn O
. O

In O
most O
rose O
books O
and O
catalogues O
a O
distinction O
is O
made O
between O
climbing O
roses O
and O
liana O
roses O
. O

This O
prevents O
damage O
by O
all O
kinds O
of O
fungi O
. O

We O
must O
therefore O
provide O
support O
to O
which O
they O
are O
attached O
. O

Usually O
they O
do O
n't O
get O
much O
higher O
than O
1.5 O
to O
2 O
meters O
. O

The B-ORG
Morning I-ORG

If O
you O
plan O
a O
climbing O
rose O
against O
a O
wall O
, O
put O
it O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
from O
the O
wall O
( O
at O
least O
half O
a O
meter O
) O
and O
bend O
it O
towards O
the O
wall O
. O

Powerful O
climbers O
such O
as O
' O
Bobbie B-MISC
James I-MISC
' O
or O
' O
Kiftsgate B-MISC
' O
can O
be O
used O
for O
high O
trees O
( O
more O
than O
9 O
meters O
) O
, O
but O
not O
for O
an O
ordinary O
fruit O
tree O
. O

One O
of O
the O
following O
weeks O
I O
will O
try O
to O
give O
some O
tips O
in O
that O
regard O
. O

It O
is O
absurd O
to O
have O
a O
rosebow O
that O
is O
so O
low O
or O
narrow O
that O
you O
stick O
to O
the O
thorns O
as O
you O
walk O
underneath O
it O
. O

Also O
the O
higher O
growing O
bourbon O
roses O
such O
as'Madame B-MISC
Isaac I-MISC
Pereire I-MISC
' O
, O
' O
Kathleen B-MISC
Harrop'or'Madame I-MISC
Ernest I-MISC
Calvat I-MISC
' O
can O
perfectly O
serve O
as O
a O
climbing O
plant O
. O

For O
example O
, O
choose O
a O
lower O
lasting O
noisy O
rose O
such O
as O
' O
Madame B-MISC
Alfred I-MISC
Carrière I-MISC
' O
, O
' O
Desprez B-MISC
à I-MISC
Fleurs I-MISC
Jaunes I-MISC
' O
or O
' O
Francis B-MISC
E. I-MISC
Lester I-MISC
' O
, O
or O
the O
beautiful O
and O
strong O
scented'Seagull B-MISC
' O
. O

Some O
are O
suitable O
for O
small O
spaces O
, O
others O
can O
cover O
a O
meters O
high O
wall O
after O
a O
few O
years O
. O

Usually O
they O
have O
large O
clusters O
with O
many O
small O
flowers O
that O
bloom O
only O
once O
. O

They O
bloom O
on O
young O
wood O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
force O
them O
into O
a O
more O
formal O
straitjacket O
, O
they O
will O
need O
more O
pruning O
. O

page O

Unfortunately O
, O
many O
rose O
arches O
that O
are O
offered O
ready O
- O
made O
on O
the O
market O
are O
often O
far O
too O
narrow O
and O
/ O
or O
too O
low O
. O

author O

Some O
of O
these O
liana O
pinks O
can O
also O
be O
used O
as O
a O
bottomcover O
. O

Disadvantage O
is O
that O
some O
only O
bloom O
briefly O
, O
but O
many O
bloom O
all O
summer O
long O
, O
up O
to O
the O
first O
frost O
. O

For O
most O
climbing O
roses O
, O
especially O
when O
they O
stand O
against O
a O
wall O
, O
that O
is O
far O
from O
ideal O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
can O
only O
recommend O
you O
to O
look O
at O
the O
blooming O
roses O
in O
rose O
gardens O
and O
rose O
growers O
and O
note O
which O
roses O
you O
prefer O
and O
how O
they O
are O
used O
there O
. O

You O
can O
also O
build O
a O
freestanding O
rack O
with O
some O
high O
poles O
between O
which O
you O
wood O
metal O
wires O
or O
a O
trellis O
work O
. O

Like O
all O
roses O
, O
climbing O
roses O
also O
prefer O
a O
sunny O
pitch O
. O

A O
rose O
arch O
or O
a O
pergola O
must O
of O
course O
be O
firm O
enough O
to O
carry O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
roses O
in O
rain O
and O
wind O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
these O
' O
tree O
roses O
' O
must O
be O
helped O
a O
bit O
by O
tying O
them O
around O
the O
trunk O
of O
the O
tree O
, O
but O
once O
they O
have O
reached O
the O
crown O
they O
will O
find O
their O
own O
way O
. O

I O
almost O
like O
them O
all O
. O

They O
should O
also O
be O
tied O
very O
regularly O
. O

If O
your O
garden O
lends O
itself O
to O
it O
, O
then O
you O
should O
try O
to O
provide O
some O
kind O
of O
construction O
especially O
for O
your O
climbing O
roses O
. O

Best O
is O
therefore O
a O
wall O
on O
the O
east O
or O
west O
where O
they O
have O
at O
least O
5 O
to O
6 O
hours O
of O
sunshine O
in O
the O
summer O
. O

No O
climbing O
rose O
can O
attach O
to O
a O
wall O
or O
anything O
like O
ivy O
or O
wild O
winged O
. O

Not O
only O
are O
they O
difficult O
to O
attach O
at O
sufficient O
distance O
from O
the O
wall O
, O
but O
also O
break O
the O
lashes O
after O
several O
years O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
roses O
. O

What O
we O
call O
climbing O
roses O
are O
just O
shrub O
roses O
that O
make O
long O
runners O
and O
support O
themselves O
along O
all O
possible O
-- O
trees O
, O
walls O
, O
arches O
, O
poles O
-- O
working O
up O
. O

If O
the O
rose O
can O
hang O
over O
the O
roof O
, O
the O
garden O
house O
turns O
into O
a O
flowering O
rose O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
summer O

some O

were O
ground O
finely O
, O
boiled O
up O

mixed O
with O
buckwheat O

This O
often O
concerns O

Sometimes O
sweets O
go O
in O

where O

If O
there O
were O
enough O
large O

in O
it O

baked O

made O
the O

None O
of O
the O
above O

mentioned O

is O
a O
regular O
butter O

because O
the O

to O
have O
something O

they O
translate O
the O

under O

he O
is O

them O
literally O

thus O
come O
from O
butter O
fish O

already O

Butterfish O
was O
not O

perhaps O
one O
of O
the O
many O

that O
are O

by O

How O
hot O
is O
the O
soup O
served O

Racist O
, O
xenophobic O
and O
inhumane O
, O
they O
are O
words O
that O
often O
happen O
when O
the O
programme O
of O
the O
Flemish B-ORG
Block I-ORG
is O
discussed O
. O

" O
What O
applies O
to O
Antwerp B-LOC
does O
not O
necessarily O
apply O
to O
Limburg B-LOC

Flemish B-LOC
Brabant I-LOC

" O

" O
Perhaps O
the O
criticism O
was O
sometimes O
a O
little O
sharply O
formulated O
, O
" O

After O

Ali B-MISC

answer O
makes O
a O
comment O
about O
the O
often O
evoked O
opposition O
between O
unconditional O
assimilation O
and O
cocooning O
in O
an O
ethnic O
ghetto O
. O

The O
parallel O
does O
not O
end O
there O
, O
just O
like O
in O
Lier B-LOC
Pricma B-ORG
was O
also O
in O
Boom B-LOC
at O
the O
cradle O
of O
the O
early O
self O
- O
organisation O
. O

There O
is O
no O
discussion O
about O
priority O
number O
one O
at O
Chebbab B-ORG
: O
the O
self O
- O
organisation O
wants O
to O
involve O
its O
own O
Moroccan B-MISC
youth O
house O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

So O
said O
, O
so O
done O
, O
Nour B-ORG
has O
already O
found O
a O
listening O
ear O
with O
the O
Boom B-MISC
police O
. O

They O
were O
mainly O
young O
Moroccan B-MISC
men O
who O
had O
spoken O
the O
high O
word O
. O

Organising O
young O
people O
, O
building O
bridges O
between O
communities O
, O
gaining O
a O

in O
urban O

policy O
, O
they O
are O
taking O
a O
lot O
of O
action O
. O

The O
pioneering O
days O
of O
Paula B-PER
D'Hondt I-PER
are O
long O
past O
, O
participation O
for O
target O
groups O
is O
now O
regulated O
by O
decree O
. O

Accusing O
the O
target O
group O
of O
apathy O
, O
that O
's O
what O
usually O
happens O
. O

Apparently O
, O
the O
Chebbab B-MISC
spokesmen I-MISC
made O
an O
impression O
. O

When O
young O
people O
become O
aware O
of O
their O
traditions O
, O
they O
will O
feel O
better O
in O
their O
skin O
. O

" O
But O
do O
n't O
take O
it O
off O
as O
the O
frustrations O
of O
some O
isolated O
hotheads O
. O

No O
, O
really O
serenely O
you O
could O
n't O
mention O
the O
recent O
debate O
on O
migrants O
and O
integration O
in O
this O
newspaper O
. O

Beware O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
throwing O
a O
stone O
at O
the O
Chiro B-ORG
or O
the O
scouts O
here O
. O

No O
more O
paternalism O
, O
that O
's O
the O
philosophy O
of O
the O
new O
decree O
. O

Fifteen O
years O
ago O
it O
was O
constantly O
stressed O
that O
migrants O
had O
to O
learn O
Dutch B-MISC
in O
order O
to O
integrate O
. O

Political O
debates O
, O
football O
tournaments O
, O
capoueira O
placements O
, O
music O
happenings O
, O
tastings O
from O
the O
Maghreb B-MISC
, O
the O
activities O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Chebbab B-ORG
. O

" O
The O
local O
focal O
point O
is O
our O
ally O
, O
" O
says O
Ali B-PER
Salhi I-PER
. O

At O
Nour B-ORG
they O
can O
confirm O
the O
word O
for O
word O
, O
although O
the O
roots O
of O
these O
youngsters O
are O
not O
in O
Lier B-LOC
but O
in O
Boom B-LOC
. O

What O
can O
we O
do O
about O
it O
? O

" O
A O
place O
of O
its O
own O
is O
necessary O
, O
" O
says O
Ali B-PER
, O
" O
because O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
Flemish B-MISC
youth O
movements O
is O
far O
too O
high O
. O

That O
's O
not O
a O
cocooning O
, O
it O
's O
exactly O
Chebbab B-ORG
's O
intention O
to O
bring O
them O
into O
contact O
with O
indigenous O
society O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O

Leman B-PER
, O
Director O
of O
the O
Centre B-ORG
for I-ORG
Equal I-ORG
Opportunities I-ORG
and I-ORG
the O
Fight O
against O
Racism O
, O
did O
not O
let O
it O
go O
and O
then O
got O
into O
the O
pen O
himself O
. O

So O
we O
have O
established O
a O
contact O
group O
so O
that O
the O
municipal O
board O
and O
the O
mosque O
association O
can O
consult O
. O

And O
indeed O
, O
like O
their O
colleagues O
from O
Chebbab B-ORG
, O
these O
mouthy O
Moroccans B-MISC
are O
also O
being O
freed O
up O
by O
local O
politicians O
. O

So O
much O
for O
the O
theory O
. O

But O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
, O
sooner O
or O
later O
you O
will O
encounter O
us O
in O
politics O
. O

I O

a O

jumping O
to O

work O
hard O
, O
you O
have O
Flemish B-MISC

you O
speak O
perfect O
Dutch B-MISC

then O
they O
vote O
for O
a O
party O
that O
wants O
to O
throw O
out O
all O
Moroccans B-MISC

Younes B-PER
should O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
ensure O
the O
correct O
application O
of O
the O
1993 O

Two O

without O
questioning O
those O

the O

the O

also O
looks O
rather O
complex O

It O
is O
ridiculous O
that O

still O
beat O
the O

with O
concepts O

Thirty O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
the O
first O
generation O
came O
down O
here O
, O
they O
should O
have O
been O
working O
on O
integration O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
these O
integration O
centres O
is O
to O
help O
bodies O
such O
as O
municipal O
authorities O
, O
OCMWs B-MISC
, O
schools O
, O
housing O
and O
employment O
services O
to O
develop O
a O
minority O

policy O

The O

held O
on O

did O
not O
shy O
away O
from O
the O
strong O

Now O
that O
the O
dust O
has O
gone O
down O
, O
we O
went O
on O
the O

to O
measure O
the O
temperature O

Many O
also O
find O
it O
too O
expensive O
, O
immigrant O
families O
usually O
do O
n't O
have O
it O
wide O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
we O
've O
gotten O
rid O
of O
that O
misunderstanding O

But O
that O
was O

the O
target O

you O

I O
have O
my O

as O

significant O
Moroccan B-MISC

Only O
they O
do O
not O

the O
chance O

insufficient O

Here O

there O
is O
no O

Today O
I O
still O
hear O
krek O
the O

sigh O

To O
whom O
should O
we O
apply O
for O
subsidies O
? O

What O
's O
actually O
going O
on O
? O

And O
then O
I O
return O
to O
my O
own O
city O
and O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
gap O
between O
Belgians B-MISC

Moroccans B-MISC

have O
to O

now O

in O

now O
established O

" O
Look O
, O
it O
's O
not O
because O
I O
'm O
getting O
into O

I O
forget O
my O

The O
wounded O
pride O
of O

With O
these O
and O
other O
questions O
I O
went O
to O
Boom B-LOC

where O
the O
Provincial B-ORG

We O
play O

with O
the O
substantive O

we O
do O
not O

then O
Moroccan B-MISC

remained O
in O
the O
cold O

Our O
interest O
in O
Islam O
fits O
perfectly O
in O
that O
picture O
. O

We O
have O
established O
the O
contacts O
and O
discussed O
the O

, O
but O
it O
was O
the O

themselves O
who O
felt O

" O

That O
did O

happen O
, O
and O
now O

stuck O

have O
sacrificed O
for O
me O
an O
hour O
of O
their O
precious O

Because O
we O
should O
not O
stare O
blindly O
at O
the O
wreath O
of O

that O
is O
now O
emerging O
in O

From O
where O
, O
then O
, O
are O
the O
complaints O
about O
the O
inadequate O
participation O
of O

? O

Another O
thing O
: O
over O
the O
past O
few O
months O
, O
we O
have O
organized O
debates O
between O
ethnic O
minorities O
and O
politicians O
around O
the O
world O

Or O
maybe O
boys O
and O

go O
to O

I O
myself O
have O
refused O
to O
stand O
for O

It O
's O
still O
very O
early O
, O
but O
I O
already O
have O
a O
list O
of O

Are O
we O

that O

need O
us O
as O
much O
as O
the O

Migrant O

pursued O
too O
far O

too O

by O

have O

How O
do O

approach O

It O
is O
not O
because O
tomorrow O
we O
appoint O
a O
Turk B-MISC

Moroccan B-MISC
as O
director O
of O
the O
VMC B-ORG
that O
all O

problems O
are O
immediately O
removed O

" O

In O
my O
view O
, O
it O
was O
an O
absurd O
situation O
. O

If O
they O
read O
in O
the O
newspaper O
that O
one O
Moroccan B-MISC
committed O
a O
theft O
, O
then O
suddenly O
all O
Moroccans B-MISC
are O
thieves O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
this O
debate O
mainly O
lives O
in O
the O
cities O
. O

As O
an O
aperitif O
I O
am O
treated O
to O
a O
dry O

necessary O
introduction O
. O

A O
few O
went O
one O
step O
further O
and O
preached O
the O
Arab B-MISC
pride I-MISC
as O
a O
way O
to O
emancipation O
. O

It O
's O
no O
coincidence O
that O
they O
mainly O
turn O
against O
Johan B-PER
Leman I-PER
. O

Turns O
out O
the O
cops O
were O
afraid O
their O
intervention O
would O
cause O
riots O
. O

The O
whole O
concept O
of O
integration O
is O
racist O
, O
xenophobic O
and O
degrading O
, O
so O
a O
polemicist O
fulminated O
somewhat O
pleonastic O
. O

An O
entire O
generation O
is O
in O
danger O
of O
being O
lost O
. O

We O
both O
made O
the O

determination O

were O
no O

talking O
about O

as O
if O
they O

up O
for O

Who O

never O
recognize O
a O

Did O
the O

up O

anything O

But O
there O
was O
danger O
elsewhere O
as O
well O
. O

Nor O
was O
it O
clear O
how O
the O
events O
were O
understood O
by O
the O
Chinese B-MISC
parishioners O

His O
parents O
( O
my O

were O
completely O
defeated O
about O
the O
fate O

There O
are O
therefore O
two O
Catholic O
currents O
in O
China B-LOC
: O
a O
' O
patriotic O
' O
, O
which O
was O
tolerated O
by O
the O
government O
but O
renounced O
papal O
authority O
, O
and O
an O
underground O
one O
, O
which O
held O
on O
to O
the O
church O
doctrine O
and O
was O
suppressed O
by O
the O
government O
. O

In O
1966 O
the O
cultural O
revolution O
broke O
out O
and O
that O
did O
n't O
make O
things O
any O
better O
. O

Except O
for O
the O
name O
of O
the O
village O
, O
which O
was O
mentioned O
in O
his O
letters O
, O
there O
was O
no O

The O
Chinese B-MISC
civil O
war O
cost O
the O
young O
Dutch B-MISC
missionary O
Leo B-PER
Bruns I-PER
his O
life O
in O
1947 O
. O

Did O
anyone O
know O
where O
it O
was O
? O

The O
government O
forces O
of O
Chiang B-PER
Kaishek I-PER
had O
to O
give O
more O
and O
more O
ground O
to O
the O
communist O
liberation O
army O
, O
which O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
Mao B-PER

steadily O
advanced O
. O

A O
nasty O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

Hard O
to O
reach O
the O
village O
is O
not O
, O
the O
train O
that O
runs O
from O
Beijing B-LOC
to O
the O
south O

stops O
at O
about O
twenty O
kilometers O
from O
Xianfeng B-LOC

the O
residence O
of O
Father O

the O
place O
where O
the O

publication O

The O
house O
of O
God O
is O
still O
in O
full O
function O
. O

It O
would O
even O
have O
been O
a O
big O
question O
mark O
if O
there O
was O
anyone O
in O
China B-LOC
who O
remembered O
him O
. O

The O
church O
dates O
back O
to O
1937 O
and O
was O
built O
by O
Dutch B-MISC
missionaries O
who O
had O
chosen O
Xianfeng B-LOC
as O
their O
base O
for O
the O
Christmas O
party O
of O
the O
surrounding O
countryside O
. O

Because O
there O
is O
one O
thing O
Mr. O
Li B-PER
wants O
to O
make O
no O
misunderstanding O
: O
in O
China B-LOC
, O
everyone O
is O
free O
to O
profess O
the O
faith O
that O
he O
or O
she O
chooses O
. O

The O
Tangs B-PER
have O
worked O
themselves O
out O
: O
the O
nieces O
of O
the O
priest O
serve O
a O
true O
feast O
in O
which O
meat O
, O
fish O
, O
vegetables O
and O
spices O
form O
unexpected O
and O
always O
surprising O
taste O
palettes O
. O

The O
cleric O
staff O
is O
one O
hundred O
percent O
Chinese B-MISC
-- O
the O
missionaries O
are O
long O
past O
. O

The O
older O
villagers O
still O
keep O
good O
memories O
of O
Pu B-PER
shenfu I-PER
, O
as O
the O
Chinese B-MISC
translation O
of O
Father O
Bruns B-PER
says O
. O

For O
example O
, O

determines O
how O
many O
novices O
are O
admitted O

edition O

The O
church O
in O
Xianfeng B-LOC
had O
meanwhile O
been O
used O
as O
a O
stock O
shed O
. O

A O
car O
is O
exceptional O
. O

Such O
means O
of O
transport O
are O
not O
at O
all O
included O
in O
the O
village O
itself O
. O

That O
's O
why O
Monsignor B-PER
sent O
me O
out O
and O
told O
the O
Christians O
that O
they O
had O
to O
go O
to O
me O
for O
ministry O
, O
that O
's O
the O
village O
of O
Changli B-LOC
. O

" O
They O
make O
it O
difficult O
for O
themselves O
and O
for O
everyone O
, O
" O
Father O
Tang B-PER
says O
. O

But O
something O
kept O
gnawing O
. O

The O
Father O
prefers O
to O
banish O
the O
past O
to O
a O
remote O
corner O
of O
his O
consciousness O
, O
as O
almost O
all O
Chinese B-MISC
do O
with O
the O
less O
beautiful O
things O
in O
their O
history O
. O

The O
suspension O
of O
the O
car O
is O
heavily O
tested O
, O
but O
the O
driver O
manages O
to O
reach O
the O
village O
church O
, O
a O
non O
- O
descript O
building O
with O
a O
tower O
. O

In O
the O
afternoon O
, O
Mr. O
Li B-PER
visits O
our O
hotel O
. O

He O
attracts O
his O
super O
- O
pleasure O
and O
begins O
to O
preach O
Latin B-MISC
prayers O
. O

That O
's O
where O
he O
had O
to O
openly O
confess O
to O
what O
he O
had O
done O
before O
. O

The O
spire O
is O
clearly O
newer O
than O
the O
rest O
. O

So O
far O
, O
nothing O
special O
. O

In O
the O

I O

it O
was O
already O
so O
far O
that O
parents O

moved O
into O

collected O

and O
after O
I O

the O
situation O

not O
improved O

He O

still O
getting O
a O
pension O
from O
it O

The O

not O

But O
before O
we O

the O
chance O
, O
he O

already O
bursting O
into O
a O
long O
monologue O
himself O
. O

A O
requiemmis O

organized O
and O
the O

In O
1939 O
, O
he O
had O
left O
for O
China B-LOC

a O
missionary O

That O
is O
why O
we O
welcome O
you O

friends O

but O
also O
as O
brothers O

Endless O

to O
an O
imposing O
gate O
, O
which O
offers O
access O
to O
a O
courtyard O
and O
a O
huge O
hall O
with O
curly O
roof O
. O

That O
day O
the O
people O
of O
the O
entire O
sub O
- O
prefecture O
were O
called O
to O
a O
meeting O
. O

The O
last O
thing O
the O
early O
People B-LOC
's I-LOC
Republic I-LOC
needed O
were O
priests O
, O
even O
though O
they O
were O
Chinese B-MISC
. O

His O
attitude O
is O
understandable O
. O

The O
government O
is O
so O
sympathetic O
to O
religious O
developments O
that O
Changli B-LOC
has O
been O
declared O
one O
of O
the O
three O
most O
religious O
villages O
in O
the O
People B-LOC
's I-LOC
Republic I-LOC
. O

The O
Christians O
are O
very O
, O
very O
poor O
. O

A O
compromise O
has O
been O
reached O
on O
this O
point O
. O
" O

The O
subject O
of O
the O
table O
conversation O
: O
freedom O
of O
religion O
in O
China B-LOC
. O

All O
right O
, O
you O
may O
be O
Catholic O
in O
China B-LOC
today O
, O
but O
you O
may O
be O
under O
government O
control O
. O

Only O
after O
the O
atomic O
bombs O
on O
Hiroshima B-LOC
and O
Nagasaki B-LOC
did O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
withdraw O
from O
China B-LOC
. O

Next O
to O
it O
is O
a O
small O
, O
cave O
- O
like O
space O
. O

And O
that O
's O
why O
Changli B-LOC
is O
now O
building O
a O
new O
church O
. O

We O
are O
not O
dealing O
here O
with O
a O
more O
or O
less O
coincidental O
incident O
, O
but O
with O
a O
systematic O
fight O
against O
religion O
. O

The O
Father O
prayed O
out O
loud O
in O
Chinese B-MISC
: O
" O
God B-PER
, O
soon O
take O
my O
soul O
to O
you O
! O
" O

Six O
years O
later O
, O
the O
government O
founded O
its O
own O
version O
of O
the O
Catholic O
Church O
: O
the O
Chinese B-ORG
patriotic I-ORG
church I-ORG
, O
which O
baffles O
the O
pope O
as O
a O
foreign O
and O
thus O
unconstitutional O
authority O
and O
recognizes O
the O
communist O
party O
as O
the O
highest O
organ O
. O

Some O
were O
immediately O
executed O
, O
others O
, O
including O
Leo B-PER
Bruns I-PER
, O
were O
housed O
in O
a O
prison O
camp O
. O

Such O
a O
church O
in O
Changli B-LOC
also O
benefits O
the O
development O
of O
the O
region O
, O
Mr O
Li B-PER
underlines O
, O
because O
its O
construction O
involves O
no O
less O
than O
52 O
companies O
. O

Then O
they O
stabbed O
him O
with O
the O
bayonet O
, O
butt O
out O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
hewed O
off O
his O
head O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
, O
the O
family O
learned O
to O
live O
with O
the O
facts O
. O

According O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
Sisters B-ORG
, O
then O
began O
the O
execution O
of O
six O
other O
convicts O
, O
who O
were O
beaten O
down O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

He O
became O
parish O
priest O
in O
Changli B-LOC
, O
a O
village O
not O
far O
from O
Xianfeng B-LOC
. O

By O
the O
end O
of O
last O
year O
, O
dozens O
of O
priests O
and O
believers O
were O
arrested O
. O

Leo B-PER
Bruns I-PER
returned O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Changli B-LOC
, O
where O
he O
was O
greeted O
by O
the O
parishioners O
. O

And O
they O
beat O
on O
. O

On O
20 O
October O
1947 O
, O
the O
Communists O
brought O
victory O
to O
Pingshui B-LOC
, O
a O
village O
near O
Xianfeng B-LOC
where O
Father O
Bruns B-PER
was O
staying O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Grain O
fields O
and O
rows O
of O
poplars O
determine O
the O

. O

The O
holy O
spirit O
even O
descended O
over O
so O
many O
villagers O
that O
the O
sober O
church O
became O
too O
small O
. O

Father O

I O
've O

And O
finally O
they O
returned O
to O
Father O

who O
was O
still O
alive O

" O
I O

" O
you O

But O
something O
kept O
gnawing O

When O
the O
church O
in O
Changli B-LOC

be O
completed O

says O
Mr O
Li B-PER

there O
will O
be O
a O
celebration O
to O

all O

be O
invited O

There O
he O
ended O
up O
in O
a O

he O
had O

tried O

that O
needed O
new O
masonry O
and O
so O
on O
and O
we O
did O
n't O
like O
that O
. O

And O
even O
with O
the O
most O
powerful O
satellite O
dish O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
can O
catch O
a O
Dutch B-MISC
- I-MISC
language I-MISC
transmitter O
. O

Is O
there O
an O
urgent O
need O
to O
invest O
in O
youth O
, O
as O
in O
Belgian B-MISC
football O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
have O
much O
theater O
to O
offer O
. O

We O
can O
already O
welcome O
guests O
there O
, O
but O
there O
are O
still O
work O
going O
on O
upstairs O
. O

I O
've O
been O
listening O
to O
Jan B-PER
Wauters I-PER
for O
a O
while O
to O
hear O
how O
the O
Belgians B-MISC
did O
it O
against O

Besides O
, O
what O
you O
can O
get O
by O
cable O
-- O
except O
for O
Arte B-ORG
-- O
is O
absolute O
shit O
. O

That O
gets O
frustrating O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
you O
get O
the O
feeling O
you O
're O
losing O
your O
time O
. O

' O
I O
sit O
down O
and O
I O
think O
: O
say O
yes O
to O
life O
, O
to O
your O
amen O
and O
your O
glory O
, O
joechee O
! O
' O

" O
Gee O
, O
that O
's O
a O
tough O
one O
. O

But O
, O
well O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
'm O
really O
gon O
na O
miss O
is O
the O
news O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
become O
either O
myself O
, O
precisely O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
imagination O
. O
" O

But O
in O
France B-LOC
a O
satellite O
dish O
should O
be O
placed O
, O
for O
the O
simple O
reason O
that O
nothing O
is O
wired O
outside O
Paris B-LOC
. O

To O
make O
it O
easy O
, O
the O
reviews O
were O
all O
published O
in O
this O
newspaper O
in O
' O
92 O
and O
' O
93 O
. O

Did O
you O
have O
television O
here O
? O

Périgueux B-LOC
, O
Bergerac B-LOC
... O

So O
. O

I O
could O
swear O
if O
that O
came O
out O
to O
me O
, O
because O
the O
use O
of O
those O

was O
only O
for O

especially O
for O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
take O

a O
possible O

something O

Maybe O
you O
will O
get O
mainly O
directors O

The O
bottom O

I O
could O
put O
things O

If O

For O
the O

twenty O

have O
been O
in O
nothing O
more O
than O
in O
the O

With O
all O
the O

mess O

even O
gets O
the O
feeling O
that O
it O
's O
all O
way O
too O
neat O
and O
too O
good O
for O
this O
piece O
, O
that O
the O

does O

get O
the O
commitment O

the O

( O

" O
It O

a O
monologue O

so O

The O
rent O
laws O
allowed O
us O
to O
stay O
here O
for O
another O
three O
years O
, O
but O
then O
it O
would O
have O
to O
be O
for O
nine O

That O
's O
right O

People O
with O
whom O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
whether O
you O
see O
them O
often O

not O

with O
whom O
you O
had O
a O
conversation O
yesterday O
that O
you O
can O
continue O
six O

There O

already O

off O

kick O

take O
place O
there O
summer O

in O
all O

But O
at O

it O

trying O

Three O
good O
actors O
to O
no O
director O
worth O
the O
effort O
, O
or O
I O
should O
be O
terribly O
wrong O
here O

The O
correct O
answer O
is O
: O
Willy B-PER
Thomas I-PER
in O
... O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
's O
been O
enough O

You O
can O
see O
it O

well O

yes O

we O
did O
our O

is O

then O
try O
to O
take O

" O
Here O
you O
are O

" O
That O
decision O
was O
made O
when O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
holiday O
home O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
second O
stay O
. O

I O
'm O
talking O
about O

school O
exams O
. O

Those O
are O
Jut B-PER

first O
cups O
I O
think O
of O
. O
" O

This O
means O
that O
the O
sound O
insulation O
is O
virtually O
non O
- O
existent O
. O

We O
then O
decided O
rather O
quickly O
that O
I O
would O
apply O
for O
my O
pension O
earlier O
and O
that O
we O
would O
just O
go O

more O
about O

For O
the O

we O
actually O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O

There O
's O
got O
to O
be O
some O
kind O
of O
understanding O
where O
you O
can O
leave O
each O
other O
alone O
. O

" O
I O
was O
also O
not O
surprised O
because O
I O
saw O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
that O
I O
used O
to O
find O
difficult O
to O
look O
at O

because O
there O
was O
too O
little O
time O

I O

it O

Originally O
we O
would O
have O
liked O
that O
in O
Roussillon B-LOC

west O
of O
the O
Narbonne B-LOC

or O
still O
in O
that O
region O

Excuse O
me O
, O
but O
then O
certain O
stage O
makers O
in O
Flanders B-LOC
are O
a O
lot O
further O
away O
. O

I O
myself O
have O
not O
become O
either O
, O
precisely O
because O
I O
do O
not O
have O
enough O

No O

Now O
I O

I O
read O
somewhere O
that O
you O

that O
from O

at O

You O
see O
all O
those O

coming O
out O

every O

there O
are O
maybe O
only O
three O
of O
them O
that O
are O
good O

there O
are O
still O
three O
of O

in O
that O

picks O
up O
something O

Fourth O

Investment O

already O
taking O

I O
've O
pulled O
a O
few O
quotes O
from O
your O
reviews O
and O
you O
should O
guess O
what O
production O
it O
's O
about O
. O

As O
a O
reviewer O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
follow O
them O
because O
the O
good O
people O
will O
become O
visible O
over O

I O
've O
had O
a O

a O
half O
to O
mentally O
adjust O
to O
that O
. O

Usually O
you O
only O
have O
two O
days O
off O
a O

and O
then O
you O
immediately O
have O
to O
travel O
twelve O

thirteen O

not O
counting O

around O

what O
the O
response O
is O
from O

But O
our O
guests O
have O
to O
realize O
-- O
now O
I O
do O
n't O
address O
myself O
to O
friends O
and O
good O
acquaintances O
, O
but O
to O
outsiders O
-- O
that O
we O
do O

know O
them O

except O
that O
they O
rent O
a O

When O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
better O

in O

we O
are O
still O
talking O
about O
the O
generation O

Bogaerts B-PER

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O

about O
that O
, O
but O
you O
're O
in O
Mauzac B-LOC
pretty O
far O
from O

cities O
of O
any O
significance O

We O
've O
said O
it O
so O
many O
times O
, O
after O
another O
disappointing O
performance O
: O
goddamn O
it O
, O
we O
'd O
better O
have O
gone O
to O
a O

there O
are O

now O

an O
end O

I O
have O
often O
read O
Libération B-ORG
and O
Le B-ORG
Monde I-ORG
and O
I O
have O
noticed O
equally O
often O
that O
I O
did O
not O
see O
any O
line O
in O
what O
is O
said O
in O
the O
reviews O
. O

That O
is O
only O
120 O
kilometers O
further O
, O
but O
because O
there O
are O
no O
motorways O
, O
you O
soon O
take O
two O
and O
a O
half O
hours O
. O

But O
as O
a O
prospector O
I O
have O
seen O
in O
recent O
years O
what O
is O
happening O
to O
young O
people O
, O
and O
what O
are O
the O
differences O
between O
the O
stage O
education O
courses O
. O
" O

There O
will O
be O
a O
separate O
breakfast O

Are O
you O
so O
sure O
about O
that O
? O

May O
I O
, O
as O
a O
salute O
, O
ask O
a O
few O
quiz O
questions O
? O

Well O
the O
quiet O
life O
, O
where O
I O
actually O
count O
on O
good O
acquaintances O
and O
friends O
to O
come O
along O
occasionally O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
we O
canceled O
our O
television O

two O
months O

and O
I O
have O
n't O
missed O
that O
for O
a O

I O
wo O
n't O

that O
at O

Then O
we O
responded O
to O
some O

for O

others O

We O
move O

more O

' O
If O
you O

then O
you O
should O
n't O
try O
to O
be O

To O
say O
, O
we O
are O
not O
completely O
cut O

that O

it O

From O
the O
stroke O
all O

has O
disappeared O

the O
text O
appears O
in O
its O
full O

its O
right O

a O
continuous O

I O
did O

've O
been O

very O
positive O

Yet O
they O

that O

What O
a O

With O
house O

this O
is O
very O
unlikely O

because O
you O

it O

not O

the O

There O
is O
no O

in O

But O
of O

that O

when O

we O
were O

Gert B-PER
notes O
that O
our O

It O
turns O
out O
that O

often O
look O
up O

Who O

this O

" O

A O
few O

we O
stayed O

near O

The O
basic O
idea O
behind O
all O
this O
? O

With O
English B-MISC
you O
come O
a O
long O
way O
everywhere O
, O
but O
usually O
it O
is O
a O
plus O
if O
you O
can O
express O
yourself O
in O
the O
language O
of O
the O
country O
where O
you O
stay O

There O
was O
nothing O

After O
all O

the O

no O

-DOCSTART- O
The O
Italian B-MISC
artist O
has O
hidden O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
room O
as O
it O
were O
behind O
caissons O
of O
light O
chicken O

in O
which O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
laurel O

were O
piled O
up O
in O
a O
subtle O
arrangement O
of O
top O
and O

, O
making O
it O
seem O
like O
the O
wind O
has O
touched O
them O
. O

For O
some O
time O
the O
word O
taboo O
has O
been O
explained O
in O
the O
vocabulary O
of O

critics O

and O
we O
only O
find O
it O
in O

In O
a O
large O
number O
of O

( O
some O
of O

an O
extremely O

worked O
out O

which O
alternates O
in O

an O

the O
different O

the O

explain O
it O
metaphorically O

After O
the O
visitor O
has O
been O
able O
to O
meditate O
on O
the O
past O
almost O
ethereal O
beauty O
, O
he O
is O
confronted O
in O
the O

a O
strange O

In O
the O

the O

is O
already O
confronted O
in O

Maximisation O
with O
a O

was O
Fuller B-MISC

lifelong O
starting O
point O
. O

Fuller B-MISC
's I-MISC
work O
inspired O
the O
British B-MISC
Archigram B-ORG
group I-ORG
and O
even O
influenced O
the O
design O
of O
Centre B-LOC
Pompidou I-LOC
in O
Paris B-LOC
. O

From O
1915 O
Fuller B-PER
kept O
his O
chronofile O
, O
a O
logbook O
in O
which O
he O
recorded O
his O
search O
with O
traps O
and O
standing O
up O
for O

The O
book O
also O
describes O

with O

, O
the O

Merce B-PER
Cunningham I-PER
and O
the O

John B-PER
Cage I-PER
. O

Fuller B-MISC
's I-MISC
greatest O
significance O
lies O
in O
the O
combination O
of O
different O
disciplines O
and O
this O
from O
an O
urge O
to O
solve O
concrete O
problems O
. O

How O
do O
the O
forces O
move O
into O
a O
structure O
? O

It O
is O
a O
representation O
of O
the O
globe O
on O
the O
flat O

a O
solution O
that O
makes O
it O
possible O
to O
better O
reflect O
the O
real O
distances O
of O
the O
continents O
. O

But O
gradually O
scientists O
realized O
that O
Fuller B-MISC
's I-MISC
search O
was O
more O
than O
solutions O
for O
structures O
that O
had O
been O
devised O
as O
a O
building O
. O

His O
inventions O
were O
usually O
ahead O
of O
their O
time O
, O
like O
the O
Dymaxion B-MISC
Bathroom I-MISC
from O
1938 O
. O

Fuller B-PER
immediately O
anticipated O
this O
finding O
and O
even O
hinted O
that O
he O
was O
the O
inventor O
. O

Spectacular O
was O
his O
Dymaxion B-MISC
Car I-MISC
from O
1932 O
, O
a O
car O
on O
three O
wheels O
. O

Early O
on O
he O
decided O
to O
consider O
his O
work O
and O
life O
as O
an O
experiment O
. O

In O
1962 O
he O
built O
a O
spectacular O
house O
in O
Hollywood B-LOC
consisting O
of O
one O
dome O
structure O
. O

In O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
conversion O
of O
the O
war O
industry O
, O
he O
designed O
his O
round O
Wichita B-LOC
house I-LOC
in O
1946 O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
get O
past O
