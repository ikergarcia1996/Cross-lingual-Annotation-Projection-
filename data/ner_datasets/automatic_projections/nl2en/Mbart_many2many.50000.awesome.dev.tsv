breaking O
them O

a O
result O
that O
Clinton B-PER

be O
proud O
of O

because O
it O
was O
a O
prerequisite O

, O
that O
the O

out O

Arafat B-PER

Camp B-MISC
David I-MISC

brought O
Israelis B-MISC

to O
the O

threshold O

they O
have O

crossed O
it O

And O
Clinton B-PER
's O
explicit O
reference O
to O
Barak B-PER
as O
more O
vulnerable O
than O
Arafat B-PER
was O
an O
important O
signal O
that O
there O

a O
limit O
in O
the O

the O

what O

But O
this O

options O
are O
. O

The O
first O
peace O
talks O
about O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
in O
1978 O
brought O
the O
Arab B-MISC
world O
to O
the O
realization O
that O
Israel B-LOC
was O
not O
going O
to O
go O
away O
and O
made O
Israel B-LOC
realize O
that O
an O
endless O
war O
was O
inevitable O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
compromises O
that O
Barak B-PER

put O

I O
read O

The B-ORG

last O

that O
the O
paper O

doing O
well O
, O
and O
the O

up O

In O
the O
past O
, O
government O
pensioners O
were O
never O
awarded O
an O
accreditation O
as O
a O

alone O

but O
they O
were O
always O
awarded O
to O
an O
inspector O
who O
had O
an O
accreditation O
at O
another O
ministry O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
social O
parastatal O
accountability O
, O
I O
find O
that O
this O
task O
is O
out O
- O
of O
- O
accreditation O
, O
which O
in O
itself O
is O
a O
practical O
problem O
and O
, O
again O
, O
a O
derogation O
from O
the O
existing O
rule O
. O

Sometimes O
more O
of O

left O
to O
the O
suggestive O
( O
nearly O
all O

than O
it O
's O

but O
that O
only O

not O

In O

you O

enough O

Although O
July O
was O
n't O
really O
bad O

it O
was O
n't O
when O
you O
compare O
to O
the O
notorious O
summer O

having O
a O

The O
new O

system O
is O
quite O
different O

" O
We O
're O
now O
busy O
implementing O
this O
concept O

the O

Respect O
for O
children O
and O
parents O
has O
become O
a O
two O
- O
way O
street O
, O
and O
we O
assume O
that O
as O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
family O
grows O
in O
the O
21st O
century O
, O
so O
will O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
children O
in O
that O
family O
. O
" O

Over O
the O
last O
decade O
, O
this O
field O
has O
expanded O
and O
expanded O
, O
and O
indeed O
you O
can O
see O
that O
children O
are O
engaging O
with O
family O
issues O
that O
are O
not O
just O
about O
them O
. O

The O
emphasis O
now O
is O
on O
connecting O
the O
two O
worlds O
, O
the O
world O
of O
children O
and O
the O
world O
of O
adults O
. O

In O
concrete O
terms O
, O
that O
means O
that O
as O
parents O
, O
you O
can O
choose O
three O
models O
of O
cars O
that O
meet O
your O
needs O
and O
do O
n't O
overburden O
your O
budget O
, O
and O
then O
you O
can O
let O
the O
kids O
choose O
between O
those O
three O
. O
" O

It O
's O
especially O
fathers O
who O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
give O
their O
children O
an O
ear O
than O
their O
own O
, O
to O
engage O
them O
in O
decision O
- O
making O
. O

And O
again O
, O
according O
to O
the O
research O
, O
both O
parents O
and O
children O
are O
satisfied O
with O
this O
state O
of O
affairs O
, O
and O
both O
of O
them O
believe O
that O
increased O
communication O
has O
led O
to O
greater O
openness O

The O
argument O
that O
car O
manufacturers O
should O
target O
children O
because O
they O
could O
affect O
their O
parents O
is O
a O
