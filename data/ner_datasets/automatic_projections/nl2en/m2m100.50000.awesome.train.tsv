The O

from O

Governor O
Guy O

, O
and O
they O
were O
pronounced O
on O
Wednesday O
during O
the O
first O
Senate B-ORG
hearing O
on O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Tobin B-MISC
tax I-MISC
. O

Because O
you O
can O
no O
longer O
make O
that O
distinction O
, O
you O
must O
tax O
all O
transactions O
as O
Tobin B-PER
proposes O
. O

Director O
Georges B-PER
Martin I-PER
called O
the O
tax O
inefficient O
, O
undemocratic O
and O
unfair O
because O
there O
is O
no O
distinction O
between O
speculative O
and O
non O
- O
speculative O
capital O
movements O
. O

The O
Tobin B-MISC
tax I-MISC
could O
count O
on O
much O
less O
sympathy O
with O
the O
Belgian B-ORG
Association I-ORG
of I-ORG

the O

That O
means O
that O
the O

to O
about O
18.5 O

Antwerp B-LOC
considers O
these O

That O

For O

Antwerp B-LOC
has O
already O

to O
collect O
about O

a O

The O
Belgian B-MISC

I O
think O

The O

more O

At O

that O

what O

because O
according O
to O
the O

the O
concept O

By O

I O
think O
that O

qualitatively O
superior O
to O
Big B-MISC

The O
SBS B-ORG

losing O
a O

Each O
time O
the O
existing O

are O
doing O
better O
than O
the O
previous O

the O
losses O
come O
from O
the O

have O
a O

because O
if O

you O
can O
still O
make O

he O
can O
do O
something O

So O
the O
shape O
of O
the O
moment O
, O
and O
the O
fate O
, O
will O
have O
to O
make O
the O
difference O
. O

But O
where O
for O
most O
positions O
the O
hierarchy O
is O
very O
clear O
– O
so O
Marc B-PER
Wilmots I-PER
must O
by O
way O
of O
speech O
already O
half O
dead O
his O
honor O
Johan B-PER
Walem I-PER
gets O
his O
chance O
– O
there O
is O
one O
post O
where O
one O
balances O
on O
a O
very O
sluggish O
string O
to O
mark O
the O
difference O
. O

In O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
general O
public O
, O
Nilis B-PER
has O
lost O
some O
credit O
in O
the O
national O
team O
due O
to O
all O
the O
pericles O
surrounding O
his O
return O
. O

But O
like O
Strupar B-PER
, O
he O
’s O
not O
one O
of O
the O
fastest O
— O
a O
flaw O
that O
analysts O
rub O
him O
under O
the O
nose O
to O
just O
not O
count O
him O
at O
the O
“ O
world O
tops O
” O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
his O
last O
interlands O
against O
Portugal B-LOC
and O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
he O
left O
a O
flattering O
impression O
. O

Waseige B-PER
about O
Strupar B-PER
: O
' O
It O
's O
not O
on O
the O

that O
he O

Those O
reasons O
can O
be O
an O

or O
, O
as O
Waseige B-PER
says O
, O
“ O
a O

who O

sensitively O

” O

Then O
there O

have O
ever O

Fortunately O

the O

remains O
limited O
in O
all O

As O
far O
as O
we O

an O
increased O
risk O
of O
melanoma O
is O
mainly O
caused O
by O
burns O
at O
a O

How O
little O
that O
is O
, O
is O
shown O
by O
a O
comparison O
with O
a O
real O
health O
problem O
: O
smoking O

We O
need O
the O
sun O
for O
the O
health O

our O
bones O
and O
for O
the O
health O

our O
minds O

It O
is O
not O
the O
length O

causes O

A O
scientific O
problem O
here O
is O
that O
people O
who O
walk O
a O

under O

are O
also O
lying O
under O
the O
real O
sun O

Our O
distant O

did O

sunscreen O

it O
is O
doubtful O
that O
they O
stayed O
under O

For O
persistent O
smokers O
who O
have O
started O
smoking O
at O

this O
chance O
is O
around O
one O
in O
three O
( O
30 O
percent O
) O
, O
or O
20 O
percent O
higher O
. O

But O
from O
recent O
overview O

, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
sunbathing O
causes O

slow O

whether O

states O
: O
“ O
Behind O
the O

lies O
another O
principle O
of O
fairness O
: O
by O

, O
as O
provided O
in O
the O

, O
this O
fair O
principle O
is O
completely O
overlooked O
. O

Specifically O
, O
that O
means O
in O
my O
case O
that O
from O
the O
age O
of O
50 O
, O
I O
will O
earn O
about O
15,000 O
francs O
a O
month O
net O
less O
than O
most O
of O
my O
peers O
for O
the O
same O

. O

I O
do O
not O
doubt O
the O
right O
of O
our O
Buddhist O
countrymen O
to O
seek O
this O
recognition O
, O
since O
the O
Constitution O
and O
the O
Act O
of O
1870 O
have O
enabled O
and O
made O
it O
possible O
for O

If O
there O
is O
such O
a O

( O
that O

will O
cost O
many O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
) O
to O
be O
distributed O
in O
our O
sector O
, O
then O
everyone O
should O
get O
their O
fair O
share O
of O
it O
and O
that O
is O
not O
happening O
now O
at O
all O
. O

Use O
that O
money O
for O
initiatives O
for O
the O
integration O
of O
foreign O
cultures O
, O
for O
the O
building O
of O
a O

I O
quote O
: O
“ O
It O
’s O
true O
that O
the O

is O
not O

from O

at O
a O

compared O
to O

who O
then O
only O
switch O

half O

But O
are O
we O
not O
on O

By O
my O

I O
also O
gave O

At O

ten O

the O

quite O
well O

In O

It O
’s O
a O
pretty O

this O
Toyota B-ORG

Ten O
years O

no O
one O
would O

made O
a O

it O

but O
today O
such O
airbags O
in O
the O

of O
at O
least O
the O
front O

have O
become O
commonplace O
, O
in O
a O
car O
of O
this O
caliber O
. O

Those O
who O
have O
more O

Toyota B-ORG
has O
not O
yet O
announced O
any O
further O
information O

The O

are O
strong O
enough O
to O
make O
such O
an O
additional O
safety O
fitting O
unnecessary O
, O
it O
says O
. O

Section O
of O

However O
, O
there O
must O
also O
be O
a O
diesel O

available O
. O

With O
the O
successor O
, O
which O
in O
the O
meantime O
already O
stands O
in O
the O
brand O
’s O
music O
halls O
, O
much O
higher O
sales O
figures O
are O
aimed O
at O
. O

Their O
seats O
can O
be O
pushed O
forward O
or O
backwards O
, O
while O
they O
are O
also O
relatively O
easy O
to O
fold O
or O
take O
away O
. O

The O
theoretical O
average O
of O
9.5 O
liters O
per O
kilometer O
seems O
to O
confirm O
that O
, O
but O
during O
our O
test O
ride O
we O
came O
to O
a O
much O
higher O
figure O
of O
12.5 O
and O
with O
the O
automaton O
even O
14 O
liters O
. O

In O
the O
flanks O
, O
equipped O
with O
two O
large O
sliding O
doors O
, O
there O
are O
some O
striking O
" O
knicks O

and O
with O
the O

running O
through O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
motor O
cap O
and O
the O
" O
laughing O
" O
radiator O
grid O
, O
the O
slide O
also O
has O
a O
view O
that O
you O
would O
have O
only O
expected O
until O
recently O
on O
the O
prototypes O
of O
an O
international O
auto O
fair O
. O

These O
seats O
are O
not O
rotatable O
, O
but O
you O
can O
loose O
them O
and O
then O
fix O
them O
back O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction O
. O

That O
at O
the O
same O
time O
bold O
and O
beautiful O
design O
we O
also O
find O
back O
in O
the O
interior O
, O
with O
a O
dashboard O
that O
consists O
of O
a O
synthesis O
of O
curved O
and O
overlapping O
lines O
. O

Next O
year O
there O
would O
also O
be O
a O
so O
- O
called O
commercial O
version O

with O
no O
seats O
in O
the O
back O
and O
therefore O
also O
with O
the O
much O
lower O
taxes O
of O
a O
business O
car O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
there O
is O
not O
even O
a O
leather O
seat O

available O

only O
makes O
our O
questions O
greater O

Sadeh B-PER

which O
are O
also O
not O

Children O
who O
do O
not O

their O
accurate O

the O
period O

the O

What O
is O
another O

So O
the O

The O

whether O

to O
cause O
an O

The O
problem O
of O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
was O
the O
too O
big O
difference O
between O

collected O
in O
the O
original O
building O

and O
its O

instructions O
for O
a O

The O
idea O
to O
build O
a O
copy O

subject O
it O
to O
shock O
came O
from O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
in O
the O
1970s O

It O
began O
with O
slight O

with O
heavier O

We O
have O
perfected O
that O
system O
by O

But O
their O
tests O
with O

were O
only O
good O
as O
a O
reference O
, O
the O
test O
results O
could O
not O
hint O
at O
the O
real O

In O
the O
end O
, O
the O

was O
naturally O

a O
“ O

was O
used O
for O
all O

One O
of O

That O

The O
careful O

To O
reach O
the O

we O
drive O
along O

We O

Before O

we O
go O
for O
another O

in O
a O
small O

We O
end O
our O

ride O
very O
relaxed O
, O
park O
the O

and O
enjoy O
a O
well O
- O
deserved O
rest O
. O

We O
are O
still O
impressed O
by O
the O
enthusiasm O
of O
the O
local O
people O
. O

In O
every O
village O
we O
ride O
by O
, O
we O
get O
a O
warm O
welcome O
from O
applauding O
children O
. O

First O
we O
get O
a O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
are O
once O
again O
impressed O
by O
the O

of O
the O

who O
have O
drawn O
up O
a O
logical O
roadbook O
worthy O
of O
the O
Cairo B-MISC

Dakar I-MISC

. O

The O
ride O
to O
Tataouine B-LOC
is O
especially O
difficult O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

The O
crossing O
goes O
well O
and O
it O
’s O
just O
three O
o’clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
when O
everyone O
sets O
foot O
on O
Tunisian B-MISC

and O
can O
thus O
do O

The O
Africa B-MISC
Twin I-MISC
, O
with O
24 O
liters O
of O
tank O
capacity O
, O
will O
be O
refuelled O
and O
will O
serve O
as O
a O
milk O
cow O
for O
the O
XRs B-MISC

Forty O
kilometers O
of O

with O
the O

a O
faithful O
ally O
throughout O
the O
journey O
. O

In O
every O
village O
we O
visit O
, O
we O
are O
warmly O
welcomed O
. O

Shortly O
thereafter O
, O
we O
fall O
without O
gasoline O
and O
, O
thanks O
to O
a O
refueling O
on O
the O

, O
ca O
n’t O
get O

We O
ride O

meet O
the O

who O
made O
the O

North B-MISC

The O
gasoline O
costs O
only O
25 O

, O
we O

can O
live O
here O
cheaply O
. O

In O
front O
of O
him O
, O
the O
Trans B-MISC
Tunisia I-MISC
ends O
here O
on O
two O
wheels O
. O

We O
then O
drink O
two O
liters O
of O
water O
and O
feel O
the O
forces O
come O
back O
. O

On O
a O
seemingly O
easy O
terrain O
, O
colleague O
Yves B-PER
falls O
heavily O
on O
his O
shoulder O
. O

Most O
drive O
in O
groups O
, O
as O
is O
recommended O
, O
personally O
we O
drive O
both O
alone O
and O
when O
it O
really O
becomes O
dangerous O
, O
along O
with O
some O
others O
. O

Anyone O
who O
thinks O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
week O
can O
be O
blown O
up O
is O
wrong O
. O

It O
’s O
already O
45 O
degrees O
and O
we O
can O
feel O
the O
sweat O
running O
under O
our O
helmet O
. O

Never O
before O
has O
the O
crossing O
gone O
so O
fast O
. O

And O
then O
there O
is O
a O
boring O
but O
necessary O
task O
that O
we O
also O
can O
not O
escape O
: O
sticking O
together O
the O
different O
roadbook O
papers O
for O
the O
various O
stages O
. O

and O
Sunday O
. O

This O
is O
hard O
work O
and O
together O
with O
a O
group O
we O
stop O
to O
look O
for O
the O
shadow O
of O
our O
engines O
. O

We O
switch O
with O
the O
XR B-MISC
400 I-MISC
from O
Yves B-PER
-- O
or O
for O
which O
the O
assistance O
is O
not O
already O
good O
-- O
and O
will O
not O
go O
through O
the O
Oued B-MISC
until O
late O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

and O
Friday O
. O

As O
will O
appear O
later O
, O
not O
always O
the O
safest O
way O
of O
working O
, O
because O
the O
mechanism O
of O
the O
holder O
sometimes O
dares O
to O
crack O
. O

Kibili B-LOC
becomes O
the O
final O
destination O
, O
but O
so O
far O
, O
we O
can O
enjoy O
the O
grandeur O
of O
the O
Chott B-LOC
El I-LOC
- O
Djerid O
together O
with O
our O
colleagues O
. O

Even O
the O
disembarkation O
of O
people O
and O
materials O
takes O
place O
at O
a O
record O
pace O
. O

Yves B-PER
will O
follow O
us O
from O
the O
car O
. O

Our O
Honda B-MISC
cars I-MISC
with O
original O
tanks O
fall O
without O
gasoline O
. O

After O
all O
, O
an O
Oued B-MISC
is O
a O
dry O
river O
bed O
and O
it O
can O
not O
be O
predicted O
. O

Or O
who O
wants O
to O
blow O
up O
after O
a O
previous O
stage O
, O
choose O
this O
less O
heavy O
formula O

The O
farewell O

those O

stay O

That O
the O
alternative O

would O
be O
populated O
by O
twisted O
swivers O
is O
a O
prejudice O
that O
Van B-PER

disproves O
. O

Cursors O
tell O
it O
if O
they O
find O
a O
course O
good O
. O

Finally O
, O
there O
are O
people O
who O
focus O
on O
spirituality O
, O
although O
most O
courses O
do O
not O
lend O
themselves O
well O
to O
it O
. O

This O
is O
also O
the O
case O
in O
the O
therapeutic O
sector O
: O
it O
is O
accepted O
from O
a O
woman O
that O
she O
goes O
from O
one O
crisis O
to O
another O
. O

Maybe O
her O
friends O
and O
her O
future O
employer O
will O
do O
the O
same O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
might O
worry O
about O
is O
the O
price O
, O
although O
that O
is O
also O
relative O
. O

“ O
That O

For O

primarily O
on O

Whoever O
believes O
that O

plays O
that O
idea O
in O

quickly O
loses O

Therefore O

that O

you O
come O
to O
two O

that O

no O
means O
correct O

These O
, O
in O

a O
long O

effort O

Being O
able O

often O
find O

back O
in O

“ O

” O
the O

say O
sometimes O

In O

the O

is O

you O
have O
to O
constantly O
look O
for O

If O
you O
have O
a O

you O
can O
only O
keep O
it O

As O
an O
academic O

you O
must O
prove O
in O
your O
speech O
that O
you O
are O

rational O

the O

The O
idea O
that O
you O
can O
learn O
from O
everyone O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
lives O
strongly O
in O
the O
field O

Social O
contact O
becomes O
important O
again O
and O
that O
is O
sought O
in O
the O
alternative O
course O
. O

But O
generally O
, O
religion O
is O
not O
central O
. O

Others O
then O
find O
it O
positive O
that O
science O
deals O
with O
them O
, O
because O
they O
may O
thus O
get O
rid O
of O
their O
stigma O

They O
are O
very O
ordinary O
people O

often O
higher O
educated O

with O
a O
surrepresentation O
from O
the O
healthcare O
sector O
: O
nurses O
, O
psychotherapists O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

They O
are O
critical O

do O
not O

no O

If O
you O
superficially O
follow O
a O
course O
, O
you O
might O
think O
that O
the O
attendees O
are O
really O
swallowing O
everything O
. O

“ O
It O
’s O
mainly O
about O
practical O
meaning O

If O
you O
choose O
that O
perspective O
, O
you O
can O
learn O
to O
appreciate O
people O
with O
problems O
. O

They O
often O
hide O
that O
they O
go O
to O
the O
course O
. O

Cursors O
from O
the O
alternative O
sector O
are O
roughly O
between O
20 O
and O
60 O
years O
old O
, O
with O
a O
peak O
of O
around O
40 O
to O
45 O
years O
old O

So O
they O
need O
the O
circuit O
of O
courses O
to O
continue O
to O
share O
that O
belief O

What O
makes O
sense O
, O
you O
want O
to O
pass O
on O

Generally O

And O
that O
is O
good O

found O
that O

at O
the O

level O
possessed O
the O
greatest O
qualities O

However O
, O
the O

play O
a O
role O
that O

Therefore O
, O
it O
seems O

that O
the O

will O
increase O
sharply O
in O
the O

This O
record O

can O
be O
explained O
by O
several O
factors O
. O

While O
these O
small O
increases O
in O
production O
can O
not O
satisfy O

All O
those O

who O
yelled O
on O
Thursday O
night O
before O
the O

of O
the O
penalty O
shooting O

, O
" O
Oh O

we O
lie O
out O

thus O
expressed O
a O
feeling O
that O
is O
statistically O
completely O
justified O
. O

The O
demand O
for O
his O
advice O
exceeds O
its O
availability O

From O
that O

perspective O
, O
we O
do O
n’t O
actually O
consider O
a O
punitive O
target O
as O
a O
“ O

What O

Of O
the O

“ O
Winning O

good O
, O
that O
’s O
what O
it O
means O

One O
has O
again O
spoken O
of O
a O

so O
in O
particular O
to O
roll O
the O
responsibility O
onto O
the O
Higher B-PER

rather O

“ O
Oh O

such O
a O

that O
whole O

Could O
it O
be O
more O
predictable O
? O

If O
they O
also O
remained O
on O
that O
level O

other O
’s O

, O
then O
they O
continued O
to O
step O

just O
as O
long O

Then O
four O

on O

Asked O
by O
Dutch B-MISC
journalists O
about O
what O
he O
would O
now O
start O
with O
the O
opinions O
of O
Doctorandus O
Vergouwen B-PER
, O
Rijkaard B-PER
mumbled O
that O
there O
would O

all O

which O

be O
carefully O

The O
Netherlands B-LOC
is O
world O

. O
” O

“ O
The O
answer O
was O
quickly O
found O
. O

Maybe O
that O
will O
unleash O
something O
with O
the O
bobo O
’s O
of O
Dutch B-MISC
football O
. O
” O

They O
put O
the O
book O
aside O
. O

Laughing O
maybe O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
Frank B-PER
the I-PER
Farmer I-PER
at O
that O
first O
penalty O
shot O
, O
I O
immediately O
realized O
that O
it O
was O
wrong O
. O

Not O
even O
being O
looked O
at O
? O

“ O
The O
Dutch B-MISC
have O
been O
overwhelmed O
by O
great B-MISC
football I-MISC
moments I-MISC
. O

I O
found O
that O
Orange B-ORG
is O
a O
well O
- O
running O
company O
that O
lacks O
something O
terribly O
important O
in O
terms O
of O
efficiency O
. O

76 O
percent O
. O

He O
thinks O
it O
has O
to O
be O
high O
. O

A O
penalty O
for O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
in O
the O
last O
minute O
. O

This O
is O
very O
deep O
in O
the O
head O
. O

In O
1970 O
, O
the O
FIFA B-ORG
launched O
the O
shoot O
- O
out O
. O

Sometimes O
he O
wakes O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
from O
a O
dream O
he O
had O
for O
the O
first O
time O
as O
a O
13 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
boy O
. O

With O
that O
data O
in O
mind O
, O
it O
is O
not O
sustainable O
to O
persist O
, O
like O
Johan B-PER
Cruyff I-PER
: O
“ O
Penalty O
kicking O
, O
that O
’s O
not O

, O
that O
’s O
psychology O
and O
you O
ca O
n’t O
train O
on O
it O
. O
” O

“ O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
, O
” O
he O
sucked O
. O

That O
was O
like O
a O
row O
team O
appearing O
at O
the O

of O
the O

without O

Like O
that O
his O

just O

printed O

The O
book O
is O
going O
to O
sell O
well O
now O
. O

“ O
Not O
even O
in O

. O
” O

Then O
you O
feel O
around O
you O
that O
everyone O
is O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
a O
fundamental O
question O
or O
need O
. O

Five O
on O
five O
. O
” O

If O
there O
was O
a O
moment O
in O
the O
history O
of O
football O
that O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
lottery O
, O
it O
was O
now O
, O
was O
n’t O
it O
? O

Professor B-PER

no O

Every O

the O

People O
from O

even O
say O
that O
when O
he O
took O
office O
( O
and O
first O
formulated O
Africa B-MISC
policy I-MISC
) O
he O
knew O
nothing O
about O
the O
Congo B-MISC
issue I-MISC
. O

That O
of O
a O
Hervé B-PER
Hasquin I-PER
, O
who O
was O
also O
a O
candidate O
for O
the O
job O
, O
and O
who O
in O
1998 O
made O
himself O
immortally O
ridiculous O
by O
moving O
to O
Kinshasa B-LOC
as O
Brussels O
regional O
minister O
, O
with O
Télé B-ORG
Bruxelles I-ORG
in O
his O

, O
to O
go O

talk O
with O

then O
, O
during O

, O
to O
gas O
him O
on O

luxurious O

Brussels B-MISC

But O
Michel B-PER
fails O
to O
note O
that O
the O
security O
argument O
can O
hardly O
yet O
explain O
why O
the O
troops O
of O
Rwanda B-LOC

should O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
strike O
down O
in O

Saturday O

But O
his O
African B-MISC
policy I-MISC
as O
mere O
egotripism O
is O
too O
simplistic O
. O

And O
that O
attitude O
begins O
slowly O
, O
though O
very O
slowly O
, O
to O
bear O
fruit O
. O

Slowly O
because O
in O
Africa B-LOC
it O
is O
not O
common O
for O
European B-MISC
politicians O
to O
descend O
to O
the O
tropics O
without O
a O
“ O
hidden O
agenda O
” O
. O

Certainly O
, O
the O
CVP B-ORG
is O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
Michel B-PER
is O
pursuing O
his O
Africa B-MISC
policy I-MISC
primarily O
to O
glorify O
his O
own O
person O
. O

Edited O

But O
many O
Congolese B-MISC
will O
interpret O
his O
second O
visit O
to O
Kinshasa B-LOC
as O
a O
return O
of O
' O
l'oncle B-PER
belge I-PER
' O
, O
who O
will O
now O
finally O
put O
things O
in O
order O
. O

It O
may O
all O
seem O
like O
some O
meat O
or O
fish O
, O
but O
by O
resolutely O
choosing O
this O
or O
that O
party O
, O
Michels B-MISC
’ O
role O
as O
a O
mediator O
would O
have O
immediately O
been O
played O
out O
. O

With O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
security O
problems O
of O
Rwanda B-LOC
and O
Uganda O
, O
the O
door O
remains O
open O
. O

Whether O
he O
does O
so O
to O
end O
up O
in O
the O
history O
books O
or O
from O
his O
concern O
for O
the O
poor O
Congolese B-MISC
, O
we O
will O
be O
worried O
. O

Belgium B-LOC
remains O
the O
most O
important O
trade O
partner O
of O
the O
Congo B-LOC
, O
but O
as O
an O
importing O
country O
, O
the O
Congo B-LOC
is O
only O
28th O
, O
as O
an O
exporting O
country O
at O
62nd O
place O
. O

Now O
Louis B-PER
Michel I-PER
is O
not O
the O
most O
humble O
minister O
in O
the O
Belgian B-MISC
government O
. O

What O
interfered O
with O
was O
the O
policy O
that O
the O
then O
government O
had O
with O
regard O
to O
Kabila B-PER
, O
and O
ultimately O
served O
no O
one O
’s O
interests O
except O
that O
of O
Hasquin B-PER
himself O
. O

So O
the O
possibility O
remains O
that O
Michel B-PER
, O
partly O
from O
his O
personal O
discovery O
of O
Africa B-LOC
during O
his O
first O
visit B-MISC
to O
the O
Congo O
last O
year O
, O
sincerely O
strives O
for O

in O

It O
is O
expected O
that O
in O
many O

insist O
on O
a O
scheme O

The O
fact O
that O
RSZ B-MISC

must O
be O
paid O
on O
both O
formulas O
was O
an O
essential O
condition O
to O
get O
the O
agreement O
around O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
separate O
scheme O
is O
being O
developed O
for O
SMEs O
. O

For O
the O
employer O
it O
is O
33 O
per O

, O
for O
the O
employee O
it O
is O
13,07 O
per O

Overall O
, O
the O
total O
benefit O
should O
not O
exceed O
10 O
percent O
of O
the O
total O
wage O
mass O
and O
should O
not O
exceed O
20 O
percent O
of O
the O

profit O
. O

However O
, O
the O
amount O
will O
not O
be O
paid O
out O
to O
them O
immediately O
but O
will O
be O
reinvested O

with O
the O
prospect O
of O
a O
fixed O
return O
for O
two O

The O

free O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
scheme O
should O
not O
exceed O
the O
indexation O
or O
the O
baremic O
increase O
of O
wages O
. O

In O
the O
first O
case O

on O
100 O

a O
worker O
retains O
85 O
francs O
, O
while O
on O
profit O
participation O
he O
can O
put O
only O
65 O
francs O
in O
his O

It O
is O
also O
important O
for O
workers O
to O
be O
effectively O
involved O
in O
the O
way O
in O
which O
the O
shares O
are O
managed O
and O
participated O
in O
the O
company O

Employment O
should O
also O
not O
suffer O
from O
employee O
participation O
. O

This O
can O
be O
done O
through O
a O
corporate O
CAO O
or O
through O
an O
accession O
act O
for O
companies O
that O
normally O
do O
not O
conclude O
a O
CAO B-MISC
. O

The O
advantage O
for O
SMEs O
is O
that O
they O
can O
invest O
the O
profits O
in O
their O
own O
benefit O
without O
being O
constrained O
in O
their O
growth O
. O

Especially O
in O
trade O
union O
circles O
, O
there O
were O
fears O
that O
social O
security O
would O
cost O
a O
lot O
of O
income O
, O
making O
it O
increasingly O
difficult O
to O
uphold O
the O
principle O
of O
solidarity O
. O

Employees O
will O
soon O
be O
able O
to O
enjoy O
the O
profits O
of O
their O

actually O

very O
large O

the O

According O
to O
one O
of O
the O
critical O
Russian B-MISC
geneticists O
, O
Yevgeny B-PER
Tverdochlebov I-PER
, O
diseases O
can O
only O
be O
truly O
combated O
based O
on O
the O
human O
genetic O
code O
when O
all O
the O

described O

for O
which O
they O
are O
exactly O
responsible O

" O
Oh O

Watson B-PER

a'square O

" O
Cassiman B-PER

I O
would O
not O
dare O
to O
say O
that O
the O
latter O
is O
a O
money O

but O
he O
is O
in O
any O
case O
pushed O
forward O
by O
the O
shareholders O
of O
his O
company O
and O
dares O
to O
go O
too O
far O
in O
that O
. O

" O
It O
's O
easier O
to O
diabolize O
Celera B-ORG
than O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O

wasted O
on O
the O
Human B-MISC

" O
he O
says O
, O
with O
the O
directness O

trapped O
in O
his O

He O
is O
a O
good O
scientist O
who O
has O
earned O
his O

who O
then O
stumbled O
his O

business O
off O

it O

, O
the O

that O

get O
his O

As O

Gucht B-PER

Earlier O
unexpectedly O

was O
raised O
on O

by O
Guy B-PER

An O

could O
not O
be O
the O
case O
, O
as O
Vanderpoorten B-PER
could O
think O
about O
it O
. O

But O
the O
VLD'er B-MISC
was O
smart O
enough O
not O
to O
personalize O
the O
final O
report O
, O
although O
through O
the O
criticism O
of O
Gimvindus B-ORG
the O
Christian O

are O
visited O

No O

needed O
to O
inform O
the O

On O
Thursday O
, O
the O
VLD B-MISC
president I-MISC
went O
much O
better O

As O
long O
as O
the O
conjuncture O
persists O
, O
there O
are O
no O
dramas O
( O
genre O
dioxin O
) O
and O
the O
CVP B-ORG
continues O
to O
stumble O
in O
the O
opposition O

the O
VLD B-ORG
remains O
the O
most O
trendy O
party O
in O
the O
political O
landscape O
( O
along O
with O
Agalev B-ORG

Per O
some O
voters O
will O
get O
overrun O

or O

In O
one O
run O

the O

stressed O
that O

remains O
behind O

His O

had O
pushed O

it O
must O
be O

The B-PER

has O
scored O
here O
in O

After O
all O
, O
an O
atmosphere O
of O

smells O
unpleasant O

More O
importantly O
, O
the O
president O
is O
a O
man O
of O
his O
word O

horrifying O

This O
week O
he O
played O
Jef B-PER
Valkeniers I-PER
the O
lesson O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
he O
positions O
himself O
as O
the O
liberal O
conscience O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
he O
does O
not O
see O
immediate O
reasons O
to O
increase O
education O
funding O
with O
the O
sole O
objective O
of O
linear O
salary O

or O
out O

of O
- O
premises O

Rightly O
, O
De B-PER
Gucht I-PER
made O
it O
an O
honor O
to O
keep O
the O
party O
members O
in O
the O
various O
governments O
and O

in O
hand O

Nevertheless O
, O
observers O
are O
growing O
the O
feeling O
that O
the O

concerned O
has O
stuck O

the O

may O
never O
come O

After O
all O
, O
his O
power O
base O
is O
narrow O
, O
his O

limited O

His O

is O
simple O

On O

Flemish B-MISC

This O

It O
is O

that O

in O
the O

Ludo B-PER

How O
is O
it O
then O
possible O
that O

Whether O

questionable O

He O
criticized O

Finally O
, O
the O

defended O
a O
vision O

which O
De B-PER

fundamentally O
disagrees O

thus O

Now O
the O

VLD B-ORG
in O
its O

had O
the O
reputation O
of O

However O
, O
he O
should O
not O
be O
too O
confident O

That O

Marleen B-PER

becomes O
the O
victim O
of O
that O

can O
not O
be O

The O
VLD B-ORG
went O
to O
the O

with O
the O
assertion O
that O
the O
level O
of O
activity O
in O

should O
be O
raised O

It O
will O
be O

Generally O

Immediately O

Vandenbroucke B-PER

Of O
course O
, O
it O
would O
be O
best O
to O
just O
leave O
the O

alone O
so O
that O
he O
can O
serenely O
deal O
with O
his O
mother O
’s O
death O
, O
and O
to O
hope O
that O
, O
as O
he O
recovers O
, O
he O
will O
also O
be O

erase O
the O

madness O

also O
arise O

these O

have O
not O
been O
in O

, O
if O
we O
do O
not O
see O
Elián B-PER

an O
abyss O
separating O

– O
and O
that O
is O

The O

taken O
an O
important O
step O
in O
the O

debate O
yesterday O
by O
approving O
a O

called O
second O

( O

Additional O
benefits O
may O
include O

for O

, O
abolishing O
the O
insurance O
tax O
of O
4.4 O
percent O

removing O
the O

( O
8.8 O

It O
complements O
the O
statutory O

For O

to O
argue O
that O

“ O

Keep O

long O
as O

and O
score O
only O
if O
it O
really O
ca O

otherwise O
, O
in O
this O
way O
the O
Red B-ORG

under O

had O
reached O
the O

“ O

take O

This O

more O
difficult O

" O

I O
could O
also O
say O
I O
would O
go O
on O

first O
and O
then O
decide O
, O
but O
that O
’s O
not O
the O
way O
I O
’m O
in O
. O
” O

For O
myself O
, O
I O
can O
justify O
all O
this O
. O

Whether O
the O
new O
coach O
in O
advance O
of O
the O
2002 B-MISC

can O
have O
the O

it O

Seghers B-PER

a O
Belgian B-MISC

Vriens B-PER
fights O
that O
because O
he O
claims O

the O

never O

up O

" O
It O
is O

the O

The O
solution O
, O
however O
, O
should O
not O
be O
sought O
in O
the O
early O
departure O
of O
the O
tired O

but O
in O
an O
organization O
and O
fulfillment O
of O
the O
teaching O
office O
that O
makes O
such O
flight O
unnecessary O
. O

With O
the O
current O

which O

a O

that O

it O
is O
therefore O
no O

that O

considers O
it O

There O

that O

more O
tax O

such O

what O

The O

That O
even O
fits O

everyone O

There O
is O
another O
paradox O

Just O
because O
creditors O
are O
so O
strong O

the O

corrections O

As O
a O
result O

the O

that O

that O
you O

The O

until O

apparently O
in O

suddenly O
looked O

uttered O
the O

words O
‘ O

Sabena B-ORG

as O
they O
told O

, O
organizes O
it O
roughly O
every O

for O
small O
groups O
of O
up O
to O
ten O
students O

With O
behind O
the O

the O

you O

just O
personally O
met O

“ O
Oh O
, O
I O
’ll O
do O
it O

that O
fly O
, O
” O
I O
say O
now O
to O
those O
who O
still O
have O
trouble O
with O
me O

However O
, O
I O
soon O
discovered O
that O
many O
flight O
passengers O
are O
wool O

painted O
air O
passengers O
, O
most O
of O
whom O
have O
dozens O

Even O
so O

I O
think O

Following O

again O

A O
culture O
of O

which O
has O
been O
sprinkled O
out O
of O
a O
fever O

and O
is O
now O
being O
pursued O
by O
collective O
horror O
vacui O
. O

At O
that O
moment O
, O
the O
other O
students O
are O
already O
hanging O
high O
in O
the O
air O
, O
while O
we O
are O
crushing O
behind O
. O

Now O
I O
expected O
among O
the O
participants O
to O
meet O
especially O
people O
who O
had O
already O
flown O
. O

The O
stewardesses O
are O

a O

shines O

No O

“ O
Here O
we O
go O

ho O
, O
” O
it O
would O
have O
whispered O
just O
before O
taking O
off O
through O
the O

There O
are O
even O
people O
who O
are O
in O

but O
the O
first O

hardly O

to O
step O

“ O

in O

I O
could O

go O

I O
learn O
that O
no O
less O
than O
two O
out O
of O
three O
people O
suffer O
from O
flight O
fear O

So O
hard O
even O
that O
my O
hands O
hurt O
and O
that O
I O
, O
arriving O
on O
the O
spot O
, O
immediately O
bowed O
over O

draw O
a O

I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
to O
start O
with O
first O
, O
about O
those O
beautiful O

illustrations O
from O
the O
ancient O
atlases O
or O
about O
the O
work O
of O
contemporary O
artists O
presented O
between O
them O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
imagination O
of O
some O
does O
not O
have O
to O
be O
inferior O
to O
the O
imagination O
of O
others O
. O

Per O
Hatoum B-PER
wants O
to O
interpret O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
world O
is O
an O
indivisible O
whole O
with O
this O
beautiful O
arrangement O
of O
hundreds O
of O
glass O

. O

It O
is O
from O
the O
contradiction O
between O
the O
soft O
values O
of O
bridging O
, O
traditionally O
a O
female O
" O
business O
" O
( O

, O
and O
the O
harsh O
political O

" O
masculine O
values O
, O
that O
this O

in O
the O

, O
that O
the O
1827 O
Atlas B-MISC
Universel I-MISC
by O
Philippe B-PER
Vander I-PER
Maelen I-PER
is O
almost O
a O
conceptual O
work O
. O

The O
Author O

The O
artist O
replaced O
the O
l O
and O
i O
of O
the O
word O
' O
Politique O
' O
with O
an O
é O
and O
thus O
made O
Carte O
du O
Monde O
Poétique O
of O
it O
. O

Her O
intervention O
is O
as O
often O
subtle O
but O
impressive O
. O

Like O
the O
minuscule O
edition O
La B-MISC
Conquête I-MISC
de I-MISC
l'Espace I-MISC
, O
an O
atlas O
that O
Marcel B-PER
Broodthaers I-PER
( O
1924 O
- O
1976 O
) O
assigned O
under O
the O
subtitle O
for O
" O
l'Usage O
des O
Artistes O
et O
des O
Militaires O
" O
. O

Whether O
the O
British B-MISC
artist O
of O
Palestinian B-MISC
descent O
that O
had O
in O
mind O
is O
unclear O
, O
but O
her O
work O
got O
at O
the O
time O
when O
the O
shooting O
knickers O
chased O
against O
each O
other O
a O
sublime O
beauty O
. O

Edited O

Surprisingly O
, O
Küng B-PER
relied O
heavily O
on O
Swiss B-MISC
artists O
in O
composing O
his O
exhibition O
and O
overlooked O
some O
obvious O
choices O
. O

A O
lady O
walked O
in O
, O
had O
not O
seen O
the O
small O
islands O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
. O

Some O
artists O
take O
a O
more O
modest O
attitude O
and O
portray O
their O
perceptions O
and O
experiences O
of O
daily O
reality O
as O
modern O
cartographers O
. O

In O
1577 O
, O
the O
Antwerp B-MISC
image O
publisher O
Filips B-PER
Galle I-PER
published O
the O
maps O
from O
the O
Theatrum B-MISC
in O
shrunk O
form O
with O
texts O
in O
verses O
. O

Also O
his O
contemporary O
Andreas B-PER
Cellarius I-PER
must O
have O
been O
a O
very O
well O
- O
read O
man O
, O
but O
he O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
heavenshopper O
rather O
than O
an O
alchemist O
digger O
to O
unknown O
soil O
treasures O
. O

All O
the O
maps O
of O
his O
atlas O
are O
displayed O
on O
the O
same O
scale O
, O
so O
that O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
area O
shown O
, O
e.g. O
a O
desert O
or O
an O
ocean O
, O
almost O
empty O
pages O
can O
be O
seen O
. O

The O
public O
shared O
his O
opinion O
, O
as O
in O
the O
same O
year O
a O
new O
edition O
of O
" O
Theatre O
of O
the O
World O
" O
appeared O
. O

The O
mental O
distance O
between O
the O
authors O
of O
the O
etched O
works O
is O
, O
despite O
the O
centuries O
that O
separate O
them O
, O
so O
very O
small O
. O

His O
brushed O
world O
map O
, O
of O
which O
there O
are O
eight O
different O
versions O

looks O
like O

Almost O
that O
happened O
also O
literally O
during O
my O
visit O
to O
the O
little O
room O
where O
Hatoum B-PER
made O
a O
world O
map O
with O
countless O
glass O
knickers O
. O

Five O

The O
famous O
atlas O
of O
Ortelius B-PER
' O
contemporary O
Mercator B-PER
was O
initially O
not O
so O
popular O
, O
but O
his O
projection O
method O
is O
still O
being O
used O
. O

In O
that O
statement O
lies O
the O
unspeaked O
belief O
that O
this O
is O
not O
always O
the O
case O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
On B-PER
Kawara I-PER
's O
" O
diaries O
" O
, O
Christoph B-PER
Fink I-PER
can O
also O
be O
mentioned O
in O
this O
regard O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
work O
with O
Hatoum B-PER
’s O
knickers O
is O
related O
to O
Broodthaer B-PER
’s O
work O
. O

I O
had O
to O
laugh O
, O
not O
out O
of O
distress O
, O
but O
because O
by O
a O
careless O
mistake O
you O
could O
disrupt O
the O
world O
order O
. O

The O
work O
of O
Tuerlinckx B-PER
is O
not O
cartographic O
, O
there O
are O
no O
papers O
, O
measurements O
and O
passes O
to O
be O
adjusted O
, O
but O
it O
has O
a O
sensual O
, O
indirect O
relation O
to O
this O
earth O
cluster O
as O
a O
celestial O
body O
in O
our O
solar O
system O
. O

I O
blinked O
my O
eyes O
and O
saw O
in O
a O
flash O
all O
the O
world O
disintegrate O
into O
colliding O
elementary O
particles O
, O
atoms O
to O
say O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
of O
Orbis B-MISC
Terrarum I-MISC
hangs O
its O
famous O
colorful O
world O
map O
. O

The O
geopolitical O
reality O
depicted O
by O
this O
map O
has O
been O
transformed O
by O
a O
small O
correction O
into O
a O
vast O
poetic O
universe O
without O
boundaries O
. O

Küng B-PER
, O
however O
, O
has O
created O
a O
context O
that O
arouses O
curiosity O
for O
this O
somewhat O
hermetic O
work O
. O

This O
is O
evident O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
World O
Library O
, O
one O
of O
the O
34 O
halls O
of O

Moretus O
, O
where O
a O
selection O
of O
the O
most O
strange O
atlases O
in O
the O
world O
is O
exhibited O
. O

The O

statements O
about O
the O
relationship O
between O
man O
and O

, O
do O
not O
fall O
out O
of O
tone O
. O

As O
you O
walk O
in O
the O
exhibition O
from O
one O
amazing O
bookwork O
to O
the O
other O
, O
you O
stumble O
into O
the O
cabinets O
now O
and O
then O
onto O
a O
work O
of O
a O
contemporary O
“ O
cartographer O
” O
. O

Still O
other O
products O
of O
contemporary O
artists O
are O
almost O
silent O
among O
the O
historical O
atlases O
. O

From O
Fabre B-PER
’s O
work O
one O
can O
deduce O
that O
it O
is O
an O
illusion O
that O
man O
considers O
himself O
the O
ruler O
and O
crown O
of O
creation O
. O

However O
, O
it O
allows O
those O
artificial O
light O
reflections O
to O
slow O
down O
and O
accelerate O
, O
so O
that O
the O
perception O

continuum O
is O
disturbed O

Some O
, O
such O
as O
Jan B-PER
Fabre I-PER
, O
have O
the O
globe O
as O
their O
starting O
point O

These O
works O
, O
which O
are O
more O
than O
a O
cool O
graphic O

With O
this O

the O

interprets O
the O
notion O
that O
the O

only O

to O
exist O
if O
the O

But O
I O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
comment O
on O
that O
. O

As O
with O
any O
genre O
, O
you O
also O
have O
to O
respect O
certain O
rules O
and O
follow O
certain O
conventions O

“ O

I O
prefer O
the O

And O
if O
you O
give O
something O

then O
it O
will O
not O

” O

But O
it O
is O
also O
a O
story O
that O
dates O
back O
to O
ancient O
times O
, O
when O
there O
were O
no O
airplanes O

You O
can O
approach O
such O
a O
situation O
in O
a O
very O
serious O
way O
or O
you O
can O
make O
a O
joke O
about O
it O
. O

What O
appeals O
to O
me O
in O
the O
work O
of O
Faulkner B-PER
and O
García B-PER
Márquez I-PER
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
is O
that O
they O
do O
not O
use O
the O
real O
world O
. O

The O
result O
is O
a O
funny O
and O
colourful O
, O
exciting O
and O
exciting O
combination O
of O
fairy O
tale O
and O
road O
movie O
, O
in O
which O
bulky O
belly O
can O
speak O
, O
double O
roofers O
appear O

It O
is O
not O
surprising O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
the O
director O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
is O
described O
here O
and O
there O
as O
“ O
the O
Kusturica B-PER

That O
is O

at O

third O

, O
who O
debuted O
in O
1991 O
with O
the O

which O
at O

Directed O
by O
Bakhtiar B-PER
Khudojnazarov I-PER
. O

I O
think O
that O
applies O
to O
all O
directors O
. O

The O
starting O
point O
for O
a O
bizarre O
, O
exuberant O
film O
between O
fairy O
tale O
and O
roadmovie O
. O

No O
one O
knows O
it O
, O
except O
that O
it O
must O
be O
somewhere O
in O
Latin O
America B-LOC
. O

“ O
Probably O
because O
I O
’m O
not O
such O
a O
good O
boy O
, O
” O
he O
laughs O
. O

Does O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
have O
a O
problem O
with O
doctors O
? O

“ O
I O
love O
seeing O
my O
mother O
and O
respect O
her O
, O
but O
I O
’m O
not O
going O
to O
visit O
her O
enough O
. O

From O
his O
mother O
's O
belly O
, O
the O
little O
Khabibulla B-PER
is O
now O
taking O
part O
in O
all O
their O
various O
adventures O
and O
also O
gives O
comments O
during O
the O
busy O
search O
for O
his O
missing O
pathogen O
, O
the O
Luna B-MISC
Papa I-MISC
from O
the O
title O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
understand O
why O
they O
make O
that O
comparison O
between O
Emir B-PER
and O
me O
. O

The O
story O
begins O
in O
a O
small O
village O
near O
Samarkand B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
seventeen O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Mamlakat B-PER
dreams O
of O
a O
career O
as O
an O
actress O
. O

At O
least O
I O
’m O
not O
influenced O
by O
Kusturica B-PER
’s O
films O
, O
even O
though O
I O
find O
him O
an O
excellent O
director O
. O

So O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
tragic O
comedy O
helped O
me O
make O
that O
decision O
. O
” O

When O
I O
tell O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
that O
his O
" O
fantastic O
realism O
" O
also O
shows O
some O
affinity O
with O
what O
we O
in O
Belgium B-LOC
call O
" O
magic O
realism O
" O
, O
an O
art O
stream O
that O
can O
be O
found O
in O
our O
painting O
, O
our O
literature O
and O
in O
our O
films O
, O
he O
begins O
spontaneously O
about O
a O
Belgian B-MISC
film O
he O
has O
seen O
, O
a O
love O
story O
with O
a O
girl O
driving O
a O
tram O
. O

One O
last O
question O
: O
why O
was O
Luna B-MISC
Papa I-MISC
dedicated O
to O
“ O
our O
mothers O
” O
? O

This O
assignment O
is O
my O
way O
to O
thank O
her O
for O
everything O
she O
has O
done O
for O
me O
. O

“ O
For O
me O
, O
this O
is O
a O
real O
story O
, O
” O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
emphasizes O
. O

I O
am O
much O
more O
influenced O
by O
literature O
, O
for O
example O
the O
novels O
by O
William B-PER
Faulkner I-PER
and O
Gabriel B-PER
García I-PER
Márquez I-PER
. O

Every O
artist O
makes O
his O
own O
country O
. O

I O
think O
they O
laugh O
at O
psychology O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
outcome O
is O
not O
chaotic O
, O
for O
whoever O
looks O
closely O
— O
for O
example O
, O
at O
the O
scene O
where O
a O
double O
- O
decker O
, O
a O
flock O
of O
riding O
horses O
and O
one O
of O
the O
main O
characters O
are O
together O
in O
the O
picture O
— O
must O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
has O
kept O
things O
quite O
under O
control O
. O

But O
because O
not O
so O
many O
tragic O
comedies O
are O
made O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
directors O
who O
are O
active O
in O
the O
same O
genre O
are O
linked O
to O
each O
other O
. O

One O
evening O
she O
is O
seduced O
by O
a O
mysterious O
stranger O
— O
the O
way O
the O
intimately O
intertwined O
couple O
glides O
from O
a O
hill O
at O
full O
moon O
creates O
a O
very O
strange O
and O
poetic O
free O
scene O
. O

Also O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
actors O
can O
not O
really O
change O
, O
you O
can O
do O
a O
few O
corrections O
at O
most O
. O

And O
that O
’s O
why O
I O
’d O
rather O
leave O
him O
out O
of O
my O
filmography O
. O

And O
so O
it O
makes O
clear O
why O
the O
filmmaker O
describes O
the O
colorful O
blend O
of O
reality O
and O
imagination O
in O
Luna B-MISC
Papa I-MISC
as O
“ O
fantastic O
realism O
” O

the O
death O

the O

that O

saved O

an O
ironic O
way O

” O

Abortion O
is O
also O
a O
paradox O

That O
bizarre O
story O
was O
told O
to O
him O

according O
to O
the O
director O

by O
a O
pregnant O

that O

up O

Three O
completely O
different O

For O
me O
, O
philosophy O
— O
or O
call O
it O
anthropology O
— O
is O
about O
man O

while O
psychology O
is O
about O

about O

about O

“ O
That O
is O
right O

How O
do O
you O
call O
it O
again O
? O

It O
was O
the O
period O
of O
the O
perestroika O
: O
everything O
had O
to O
be O
free O
and O
you O
could O
really O
do O
it O

But O
he O
decided O
that O
there O
was O
" O
something O
" O
out O
of O
that O
plane O
going O
to O
fall O

Another O
example O
of O
an O
economic O
paradox O
is O
that O
America B-LOC

great O

implies O
that O
some O

The O
fact O
that O

Really O
done O
or O

, O
it O
is O
in O
any O
case O
a O
beautiful O
illustration O

Khudojnazarov B-MISC

statement O
that O
the O

where O

of O
such O
nature O
is O
that O
the O
reality O
there O
is O
simply O
“ O

So O
many O

come O
together O

That O

that O

why O

then O
tried O

something O

nothing O

not O

the O

though O

we O
used O

against O

According O

Not O
because O
they O
think O
there O
are O
insufficient O
listeners O
, O
but O
because O
the O
frequencies O
could O
be O
used O
more O
interestingly O
for O
some O
groups O

by O
any O
technique O

“ O
Yes O
, O
but O
that O
did O
not O
happen O

Gradually O
, O
radio O
, O
television O
and O

will O
create O
a O
new O
medium O
with O
interactivity O
as O
an O
added O
value O
. O

" O
We O
have O
looked O
at O
that O
internally O
in O
a O
number O
of O
scenarios O
and O
are O
not O
really O
awake O
of O
it O

will O
soon O

more O

" O
Then O
it O
would O
be O
very O
dangerous O
to O
let O
Donna B-ORG
fall O
. O

Donna B-ORG
brings O
more O

than O
any O
commercial O

In O
the O
whole O
Flemish B-MISC
community O
life O
, O
Donna B-ORG
plays O
an O
important O
role O
: O
keeping O
people O
together O
and O
bringing O

They O
also O
have O
radio O

What O
if O
the O

It O
would O
therefore O
make O
sense O
for O
the O
competition O
to O
try O
it O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O
” O

We O
expect O
losses O
, O
but O
do O
not O
put O
concrete O
figures O
on O
it O
because O
it O
is O
absolutely O
looking O
coffee O
thickness O
. O

The O
Flemish B-MISC
government O
wants O
to O
make O
the O
VRT B-MISC
radio I-MISC
advertising O
poor O
... O

And O
then O
it O
happened O
. O

Revenue O
that O
does O
not O
increase O
the O
budget O
for O
the O
VRT B-MISC
radio I-MISC
stations I-MISC
. O

But O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
if O
everyone O
thinks O
it O
’s O
such O
a O
good O
idea O
. O
” O

Then O
the O
VRT B-MISC
radio I-MISC
ceases O
to O
be O
a O
public O
service O
and O
we O
become O
a O
service O
for O
some O
groups O
. O

The O
guarantees O
the O
government O
requires O
from O
the O
VRT B-ORG
are O
much O
larger O
than O
those O
of O
commercial O
stations O
. O

Donna B-ORG
is O
not O
doing O
much O
better O
in O
reality O
. O

But O
still O
, O
some O
question O
the O
function O
of O
this O
cultural O
channel O

We O
are O
especially O
closely O
connected O
with O
everything O
that O
happens O
in O
the O
field O
of O
social O
events O
. O

We O
are O
as O
dependent O
on O
the O
legislature O
as O
the O
commercial O
stations O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Radio B-ORG
3 I-ORG
reaches O
more O
than O
100,000 O
people O
every O
day O
. O

Radio B-ORG
2 I-ORG
and O
Radio B-ORG
Donna I-ORG
have O
so O
far O
been O
the O
most O
obvious O
VRT B-MISC

to O
be O
attacked O
, O
because O
they O
are O
on O

the O

is O
the O

Can O

Regardless O

of O

As O

the O
VRT B-ORG
of O

does O
not O
even O
have O
the O

do O
so O
effectively O
at O
this O
time O

Our O
basic O
task O
will O
continue O
to O
exist O
in O
the O
future O
to O
make O
high O

quality O
radio O
for O
the O
entire O
Flemish B-MISC

The O
VRT B-ORG
is O
still O
the O
broadcaster O

entire O
Flemish B-ORG

more O
than O
a O

The O
wing O
is O
made O
. O

For O
Mona B-MISC
Lisa I-MISC
, O
we O
decided O
not O
to O
carry O
out O
that O
project O
. O

A O
commercial O
station O
that O
should O
stick O
to O
the O
same O
standards O
would O
move O
heaven O
and O
earth O
and O
say O
it O
wo O
n’t O
get O
a O
fair O
chance O
. O

That O
does O
not O
prove O
that O
we O
believe O
in O
the O
middle O
wave O
, O
but O
that O
we O
have O
nothing O
else O
because O
of O
the O
large O
frequency O
shortage O
on O
the O
FM O
band O
. O

" O
Per O
an O
inheritance O
from O
one O
of O
my O
predecessors O
, O
" O
says O
the O
new O
VRT B-MISC
radio I-MISC
. O

What O
the O
exact O
intentions O
of O
the O
media O
minister O
are O
, O
we O
will O
know O
only O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
. O

With O
the O
Mona B-MISC
Lisa I-MISC
project O
, O
the O
VRT B-ORG
wanted O
to O
reactivate O
the O
AM O
to O
launch O
a O
rock O
/ O
pop O
and O
easy O
listening O
channel O
there O
. O

We O
also O
have O
to O
play O
with O
the O
cards O
we O
are O
given O
. O

We O
have O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
projects O
, O
but O
they O
have O
not O
been O
leaked O
and O
have O
not O
been O
realized O
. O

That O
is O
an O
experiment O
that O
we O
are O
currently O
conducting O
measurements O
and O
research O
around O
to O
be O
able O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
current O
impact O
of O
the O
analog O
AM O
radio O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
feel O
that O
the O
competition O
fears O
it O
is O
still O
difficult O
to O
get O
into O
the O
market O
of O
Radio B-ORG
2 I-ORG
and O
Radio B-ORG
Donna I-ORG
because O
we O
have O
botonized O
them O
as O
public O

as O
it O
were O

Radio B-ORG
2 I-ORG
is O
still O
there O
, O
and O
especially O
strong O
. O

Frans B-PER
Ieven I-PER
( O

" O
And O
that O
will O
be O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
new O
management O
agreement O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
public O
broadcaster O
that O
will O
be O
discussed O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
. O

“ O
Commercial O
radios O
still O
have O
to O
prove O
that O
they O
can O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
VRT B-ORG
can O
only O
express O
legitimate O
expectations O
. O
” O

Radio B-ORG
2 I-ORG
has O
been O
thoroughly O
reformed O
, O
and O
although O
we O
have O
lost O
a O
few O
percentage O
points O
of O
market O
share O
, O
I O
dare O
not O
predict O
what O
the O
loss O
would O
have O
been O
without O
this O
thorough O
and O
much O
- O
needed O
renewal O
operation O
. O

At O
least O
half O
a O
year O
before O
the O
commercial O
radio O
competitors O
arrive O
, O
the O
public O
broadcaster O
today O
with O
Frans B-PER
Ieven I-PER
will O
get O
a O
new O
driven O
radio O
show O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
we O
are O
monitoring O
the O
possibilities O
of O
the O
new O
technologies O
so O
that O
we O
can O
continue O
to O
guarantee O
that O
same O
service O
package O
through O
democratic O
access O

“ O
I O
have O
a O
simple O
solution O
for O
that O
: O
let O
the O
VRT B-MISC

generate O
their O

it O
was O
really O
about O
that O
each O
resident O
had O
his O
own O
private O

there O
. O

Reyes B-PER
himself O
had O
much O
influence O
on O
the O
transition O
from O
French B-MISC
to O
Mexican B-MISC
influences O
in O
interior O
design O
. O

A O
Barragán B-MISC
window I-MISC
frames O
a O
piece O

, O
a O
Barragán B-MISC

fits O
only O
in O
the O
area O
where O
it O
stands O

Thro O
his O
professional O
existence O
, O
Luis B-PER
Barragán I-PER
has O
never O
left O
the O
rich O
circle O
. O

Barragán B-PER
then O
sought O
to O
work O
out O
his O
patio O
architecture O
, O
according O
to O
Bac B-MISC
's O
vision O
, O
and O
to O
add O
emotion O
, O
an O
aspect O
he O
lacked O
in O
the O
international O
modernism O
that O
was O
too O
" O
sterile O
" O
for O
him O
( O
although O
he O
built O
some O
purely O
modernist O
houses O
in O
Mexico B-LOC

, O
but O
that O
was O
in O
his O
early O
days O

Twenty O

later O
he O
graduated O
as O

These O
last O
two O
aspects O
, O
which O
give O
heart O
and O
soul O
to O
a O
building O
, O
are O
too O
often O
missing O
here O

How O
great O
that O
love O
was O
is O
reflected O
in O
his O

The O
huge O
plot O
went O
out O
of O
hand O
almost O
for O
nothing O
because O
of O
the O
unfertile O
, O
unmanufactured O
soil O
. O

Monasteries O
and O
haciendas O
were O
the O
buildings O
that O
had O
left O
their O
clearest O
impressions O
on O
him O
. O

That O
he O
has O
such O
a O
recognizable O
style O
, O
of O
course O
, O
also O
derives O
from O
the O
large O
area O
that O
Barragán B-PER
could O
always O
build O
. O

Since O
the O
houses O
were O
always O
a O
variation O
on O
the O
same O
theme O
, O
we O
can O
speak O
of O
a O
clear O
Barragán B-MISC
style I-MISC
. O

Barragán B-PER
also O
cared O
about O
its O
surroundings O
— O
notable O
is O
the O
wide O
lane O
he O
made O
, O
kilometers O
long O
, O
where O
he O
and O
his O
acquaintances O
could O
enjoy O
galoping O

In O

What O
we O
already O

: O
he O
is O
an O

The O

Reyes B-PER
was O
an O
artist O
and O
antique O
, O
and O
also O
he O
permeated O
Barragán B-PER
with O
the O
importance O
of O
expressing O
the O
indigenous O
Mexican B-MISC
culture O
in O
his O
work O
. O

There O
is O
a O
reason O
why O
we O
did O
n’t O
know O
him O
well O
. O

In O
1988 O
, O
the O
Mexican B-MISC
architect O
Luis B-PER
Barragán I-PER
died O
, O
and O
now O
the O
West B-LOC
wants O
to O
know O
everything O
about O
him O
. O

In O
the O
early O
1940s O
, O
when O
Barragán B-PER
fully O
developed O
his O
own O
style O
, O
he O
bought O

When O
he O
was O
back O
in O

after O
the O

he O
made O
friendship O
with O
two O

Rafael B-PER

Ignacio B-PER

In O

That O
the O
Mexican B-MISC

himself O
has O

During O

: O
the O

in O
Mexican B-MISC
Stone O

Later O
, O
the O
men O
met O
, O
and O
Bac B-PER
would O
have O
inspired O
and O
prompted O
Barragán B-PER
to O
intertwin O
architecture O
and O
natural O
surroundings O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O

As O
the O
years O
progressed O
, O
more O
and O
more O
countries O
joined O

What O
makes O
the O
Mexican B-MISC
Barragán B-PER
attractive O
to O
the O
flat O
- O
minimized O
West B-LOC
, O
is O
that O
whole O
separate O
blend O
of O
modernism O
with O
local O
elements O
: O
the O
colors O
and O
feel O
. O

That O
distinguishes O
his O
work O
forever O
from O
all O
other O
20th O
- O
century O
architectural O
achievements O
. O

Therefore O
, O
social O
engagement O
should O
not O
be O
sought O
with O
this O
architect O
. O

Bac B-PER
believed O
that O
gardens O
should O
be O
" O
magic O
places O
for O
meditation O
" O
, O
that O
they O
should O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
enchant O
the O
viewer O
. O

Like O
the O
Portuguese B-MISC
Alvaro B-PER
Siza I-PER
, O
Luis B-PER
Barragán I-PER
also O
managed O
to O
create O
a O
mixed O
form O
: O
Mexican B-MISC
tradition O
linked O
to O
the O
international O
modernist O
style O
. O

That O
began O
immediately O
after O
his O
studies O
— O
he O
traveled O
to O
France B-LOC
and O
Spain B-LOC

and O
stayed O
there O
for O
a O
year O
or O
two O
. O

Edited O

With O
such O
a O
Mexican B-MISC
hacienda O
, O
you O
should O
not O
imagine O
a O
Belgian B-MISC
farmhouse O
: O
before O
the O

of O
1910 O
( O
after O
the O
revolution O
they O
were O
seized O
) O
such O
a O

rarely O
had O
the O

What O
makes O
Barragán B-PER
attractive O
to O
the O
meanwhile O
flat O

minimized O

is O
through O
that O
whole O

The O
Author O

Not O
many O
details O
are O
known O
about O
his O
origins O
— O
but O
we O
know O
that O
he O
came O
from O
an O
aristocratic O
family O
, O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
a O
farm O
near O
the O
village O
of O
Mazamitla B-LOC
in O
Michoacan B-LOC
, O
a O
region O
known O
for O
its O
peculiar O
indigenous O
architecture O
. O

It O
also O
meant O
that O
all O
facets O
of O
everyday O
life O
could O
be O
found O
in O
such O
a O
hacienda O
: O
birth O
, O
baptism O
and O
marriage O
, O
the O
fiesta O
and O
the O
competitions O
, O
the O
bullfights O
and O
the O
harvest O
parties O
. O

In O
the O
early O
1940s O
, O
Luis B-PER
Barragán I-PER
learned O
by O
looking O
at O
those O
friendships O
to O
his O
own O
country O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
the O
house O
for O
the O
family O
Engeström B-PER
: O
on O
this O
large O
estate O
, O
the O
residential O
house O
is O
surpassed O
in O
beauty O
and O
poetic O
strength O
by O
the O
part O
dedicated O
to O
the O
horses O
. O

Barragán B-PER
could O
relentlessly O
surrender O
to O
an O
intellectual O
, O
artistically O
tinted O
existence O
full O
of O
formal O
poetry O
. O

Barragánined B-PER
his O
parent O
hacienda O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
preference O
for O
space O
, O
and O
for O
typically O
Mexican B-MISC
elements O
, O
also O
a O
love O
for O
horses O
. O

About O
the O
colors O
: O
we O
seem O
that O
bright O
and O
daring O
, O
but O
on O
one O

you O
can O
actually O
encounter O
them O
all O

Despite O
his O
cottage O
- O
like O
existence O
, O
Luis B-PER
Barragán I-PER
has O
also O
left O
a O
certain O
sense O
of O
community O
to O
the O
hacienda O
: O
at O
a O
certain O
point O
in O
his O
life O
, O
for O
example O
, O
he O
built O

' O
, O
a O
' O
cave O
' O
full O
of O
houses O
for O
wealthy O

Remarkable O
about O
this O
chapel O
is O
that O
he O
does O
not O
place O
the O
wooden O
cross O
in O
a O
central O
place O
, O
but O
on O
the O
side O
, O
so O
that O
the O
cross O
must O
wait O
for O
the O
sun O
, O
before O
it O
can O
throw O
its O
shadow O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
chapel O
. O

Barragán B-PER
wanted O
to O
make O
it O
a O
residential O
area O
for O
wealth O
lazy O
, O
and O
he O
built O
houses O
, O
streets O
, O
pools O
, O
paths O
and O
fountains O
that O
merged O
with O
the O
rock O
formations O
in O
the O
volcanic O
lunar O
landscape O
. O

To O
be O
“ O
discovered O
” O
, O
sometimes O
you O
just O
have O
to O
die O
. O

This O
has O
also O
made O
Barragán B-PER
the O
distinct O
architect O
he O
was O
: O
not O
brainwashed O
by O
training O
, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
mature O
and O
express O
his O
own O
mentality O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
the O
last O
thirty O
years O
of O
his O
life O
, O
he O
built O
only O
three O
houses O

It O
is O
remarkable O
that O
, O
despite O

he O
immediately O
profiled O

There O
are O
still O
many O

to O
integrate O

In O

if O
they O
are O

that O
may O
not O
be O
so O
noticeable O
, O
but O
in O
winter O

spring O
that O

usually O
no O

Many O
of O
those O
so O
- O
called O
climbing O
roses O
can O
also O
be O
grown O
as O
a O
regular O
bush O
with O
any O
cutting O

while O
a O
lot O
of O
roses O
usually O
grown O
as O
a O
bush O
can O
also O
be O
used O
perfectly O
as O
climbing O
rose O

Liaanroses O
have O
very O
long O
, O
loose O
branches O
. O

I O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
choose O
, O
and O
with O
roses O
, O
that O
is O
the O
case O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
climbing O
roses O
are O
situated O
between O
the O
liaan O
and O
the O

the O
powerful O

somewhat O
fuzzy O
growth O
of O
the O
lyan O
rose O
, O
but O
carry O
pretty O
large O
flowers O
that O
flourish O
well O
. O

They O
usually O
require O
a O
little O
more O
care O
than O
those O
liaanrozelaers O
because O
the O
flushed O
flowers O
need O
to O
be O
cut O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
. O

Some O
grow O
in O
light O
to O
heavy O
shade O
and O
even O
against O
a O
wall O
in O
the O
north O
, O
but O
their O
bloom O
will O
never O
be O
as O
overwhelming O
as O
on O
a O
more O
' O
bound O
' O
wall O
. O

The O
climbing O
roses O
are O
somewhat O
stiffer O
in O
growth O
compared O
to O
the O
lyanos O
with O
thicker O
, O
rising O
branches O
and O
usually O
much O
larger O
flowers O
. O

To O
attach O
them O
to O
the O
wall O
, O
you O
can O
use O
all O
kinds O
of O
methods O

materials O

In O

you O

Many O
of O
these O
climbing O
horse O
roses O
are O
very O
suitable O
for O
smaller O
gardens O
or O
as O
a O
modest O
climbing O
around O
a O
metal O
or O
wooden O
obelisk O
or O
climbing O
rack O
in O
a O
flower O
field O
. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
make O
a O
solid O
fence O
of O
wooden O
beams O
or O
of O
metal O
( O
for O
example O
, O
a O
concrete O
mat O
is O
ideal O
, O
although O
it O
is O
not O
very O
beautiful O
in O
the O
first O
few O
years O
) O
, O
or O
to O
stretch O
metal O
cables O
. O

They O
also O
usually O
bloom O
through O
or O
they O
bloom O
a O

at O

Cutting O
is O
not O
necessary O
, O
unless O
then O
to O
occasionally O
remove O
some O
dry O
or O
too O
thick O
branches O
. O

For O
such O
an O
application O
, O
it O
is O
best O
not O
to O
choose O
too O
strongly O
growing O
roses O
with O
smooth O
branches O
that O
you O
can O
easily O
attach O
spirally O
, O
such O
as O

The O
foldable O
racks O
of O
thin O
wooden O
or O
plastic O
beads O
sold O
in O
garden O
centers O
are O
worthless O
as O
support O
racks O
for O
roses O
( O
and O
for O
most O
climbing O
plants O
) O
. O

Ideally O
, O
in O
the O
autumn O
each O
year O
, O
you O
should O
cut O
off O
the O
flattened O
branches O
to O
a O
strong O
side O
shoot O
or O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
you O
should O
choose O
the O
roses O
according O
to O
the O
tree O
in O
which O
they O
will O
grow O
. O

Buy O
simple O
models O
, O
without O
too O
many O
tirelantins O
that O
you O
will O
not O
see O
when O
they O
are O
completely O
covered O
under O
the O
roses O
. O

Most O
climbing O
roses O
will O
be O
better O
at O
their O
liking O
anyway O
if O
they O
get O
a O
little O
more O
space O
than O
against O
a O
wall O
and O
the O
wind O
can O
go O
around O
well O
on O
all O
sides O
. O

A O
very O
attractive O
way O
to O
use O
climbing O
roses O
is O
to O
grow O
them O
by O
growing O
an O
old O
( O
fruit O
) O
tree O
or O
a O
boring O
conifer O
. O

Such O
a O
rose O
support O
should O
be O
at O
least O
2.5 O
m O
high O
. O

It O
can O
be O
a O
pergola O
or O
a O
rosary O
. O

Lyanroses O
require O
little O
care O
, O
only O
they O
need O
to O
be O
applied O
almost O
permanently O
during O
the O
first O
few O
years O
. O

Because O
of O
their O
slightly O
more O
controlled O
growth O
and O
their O
longer O
flowering O
, O
they O
are O
more O
suitable O
for O
most O
gardens O
than O
the O
liaanrozelaars O
. O

Due O
to O
their O
enormous O
growth O
power O
– O
some O
varieties O
grow O
more O
than O
four O
meters O
per O
season O
– O
they O
are O
less O
suitable O
for O
a O
small O
garden O
. O

A O
rose O
arc O
or O
pergola O
, O
of O
course O
, O
must O
be O
solid O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
carry O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
climbing O
roses O
in O
rain O
and O
wind O
, O
but O
some O
structures O
seem O
more O
destined O
to O
hang O
an O
elephant O
on O
it O
. O

So O
do O
n’t O
ask O
me O
to O
give O
you O
a O
list O
of O
my O
favorites O
. O

There O
is O
no O
single O
climbing O
plant O
that O
blooms O
so O
spectacularly O
and O
in O
such O
an O
abundance O
of O
colors O
and O
smells O
as O
the O
rose O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
ground O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
wall O
usually O
very O
dry O
, O
but O
in O
addition O
they O
are O
almost O
literally O
roasted O
on O
hot O
summer O
days O
. O

The O
annual O
cutting O
is O
fairly O
simple O
: O
regularly O
the O
long O
growth O
sticks O
should O
be O
removed O
if O
there O
are O
too O
many O
and O
old O
, O
dead O
and O
poorly O
blooming O
branches O
should O
be O
removed O
. O

Between O
the O
pins O
, O
hang O
thick O
strings O
along O
which O
you O
lead O
the O
roses O
, O
so O
you O
get O
a O
kind O
of O
rosengirlandes O
. O

In O
the O
first O
few O
years O
, O
this O
is O
usually O
not O
necessary O
, O
but O
it O
is O
most O
important O
to O
take O
care O
of O
a O
good O
basic O
structure O
. O

A O
fine O
example O
of O
this O
is O

, O
an O
old O

strongly O
scented O
shrimp O
rose O
with O
beautiful O
deeped O
flowers O
that O
is O
usually O
grown O
as O
a O
thick O
bush O
, O
but O
which O
can O
be O
better O
used O
as O
a O
low O
climber O
due O
to O
the O
sluggish O
branches O
that O
barely O
stand O
upright O
on O
their O
own O
. O

It O
has O
fairly O
large O
dark O
pink O
flowers O
, O
blossoms O
well O
and O
smells O
delicious O
. O

Except O
, O
for O
example O
, O
to O
remove O
a O
very O
high O
wall O
from O
sight O
or O
to O
grow O
a O
garden O
house O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
flowering O
side O
branches O
are O
formed O
over O
the O
full O
length O
of O
the O
main O
branches O
. O

Since O
almost O
all O
climbing O
roses O
, O
with O
one O
exception O
, O
usually O
have O
fixed O
thorns O
( O
because O
their O
wild O
ancestors O
needed O
thorns O
to O
cling O
to O
other O
bushes O
and O
trees O
looking O
for O
the O
sun O
) O
, O
that O
’s O
not O
always O
a O
sinecure O
. O

The O
side O
branches O
that O
have O
blossomed O
should O
be O
cut O
down O
to O
about O
10 O
- O
15 O
cm O
each O
year O
. O

Some O
climbing O
and O
lioning O
roses O
grow O
in O
light O
to O
heavy O
shade O
and O
even O
against O
a O
wall O
in O
the O
north O
, O
but O
their O
bloom O
will O
never O
be O
as O
overwhelming O
as O
on O
a O
more O
' O
bound O
' O
wall O
. O

For O
this O
you O
can O
use O
almost O
any O
climbing O
and O
lyan O
rose O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
length O
and O
height O
of O
your O
rose O
screen O
– O
very O
beautiful O
are O
the O
older O
Moschat B-MISC
hybrids I-MISC
. O

If O
such O
a O
strong O
cutting O
is O
not O
possible O
or O
not O
desirable O
, O
then O
you O
should O
ensure O
a O
number O
of O
solid O
main O
branches O
and O
cut O
all O
sluggish O
side O
branches O
to O
about O
15 O
cm O
. O

Make O
it O
at O
least O
2 O
meters O
wide O
and O
about O
2.30 O
meters O
high O
. O

By O
many O
lovers O
, O
the O
slightly O
stiffer O
" O
Madame B-MISC
Alfred I-MISC
Carrière I-MISC
" O
, O
which O
was O
introduced O
in O
1879 O
by O
the O
French B-MISC
rose O
grower O
Joseph B-PER
Schwartz I-PER
, O
is O
still O
considered O
the O
best O
white O
climber O
, O
very O
early O
and O
very O
long O
blooming O
. O

The O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
choose O
in O
view O
of O
where O
they O
should O
come O
( O
for O
a O
wall O
in O
the O
north O
, O
for O
example O
, O
only O
a O
few O
are O
eligible O
) O
and O
the O
support O
against O
which O
they O
should O
grow O
. O

In O
both O
cases O
, O
you O
need O
to O
make O
sure O
they O
are O
high O
and O
wide O
enough O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
they O
are O
often O
so O
ugly O
that O
rather O
than O
a O
jewel O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
they O
are O
a O
permanent O
source O
of O
irritation O
. O

Later O
, O
the O
young O
branches O
will O
nest O
among O
the O
old O
ones O
and O
take O
great O
care O
of O
themselves O
. O

For O
such O
an O
application O
, O
it O
is O
best O
to O
use O
a O
lyan O
rose O
whose O
long O
flexible O
branches O
can O
be O
easily O
turned O
around O
the O
strings O
. O

But O
during O
the O
flowering O
, O
the O
effect O
is O
overwhelming O
. O

Along O
a O
garden O
path O
you O
can O
hit O
low O
pins O
in O
the O
ground O
of O
such O
a O
good O
meter O
high O
. O

You O
should O
always O
make O
sure O
that O
there O
is O
at O
least O
10 O
to O
15 O
cm O
of O
space O
between O
the O
wall O
and O
the O
rose O
so O
that O
the O
wind O
can O
go O
behind O
it O
. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
do O
this O
, O
the O
rose O
only O
grows O
in O
height O
and O
will O
also O
bloom O
only O
at O
the O
top O
, O
while O
the O
bush O
at O
the O
bottom O
becomes O
completely O
bald O
. O

This O
can O
sometimes O
be O
difficult O
against O
a O
high O
wall O
or O
pergola O
or O
when O
standing O
between O
other O
plants O
. O

All O
climbing O
roses O
bloom O
best O
if O
their O
branches O
are O
guided O
as O
horizontally O
as O
possible O
or O
in O
arc O
shape O
. O

I O
have O
in O
my O
garden O
, O
for O
example O
, O
two O
New B-MISC
Dawns I-MISC
standing O
, O
one O
against O
a O
wall O
in O
the O
south O
, O
the O
other O
just O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
( O
for O
the O
time O
being O
) O
supported O
with O
some O
bamboo O
trees O
in O
wigworm O
shape O
. O

Generally O

Also O
, O
some O
of O
the O
ancient O
Wichurian B-MISC
hybrids I-MISC
, O
such O
as O
" O
Albéric B-MISC
Barbier I-MISC
" O
and O
" O
Albertine B-MISC
" O
, O
have O
everything O
from O
a O
lyan O
rose O
, O
but O
the O
flowers O
are O
larger O
and O
they O
bloom O
a O
second O
time O
in O
autumn O
. O

In O
most O
rosary O
books O
and O
catalogues O
, O
one O
makes O
a O
distinction O
between O
climbing O
roses O
and O
lyanos O
. O

This O
prevents O
attacks O
by O
all O
kinds O
of O
mushrooms O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
must O
provide O
support O
to O
which O
they O
are O
attached O
. O

Usually O
they O
do O
not O
grow O
much O
higher O
than O
1.5 O
to O
2 O
meters O
. O

place O
it O

Usually O
they O
have O
large O
buds O
with O
many O
small O
flowers O
that O
bloom O
only O
once O
. O

They O
bloom O
on O
young O
wood O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
force O
them O
into O
a O
more O
formal O
slide O
, O
they O
will O
need O
more O

Unfortunately O
, O
many O
of O
the O
rosary O
arches O
that O
are O
available O
in O
the O
market O
are O
often O
too O
narrow O
and/or O
too O
low O
. O

Author O

Some O
of O
these O
lyanocellars O
can O
also O
be O
used O
as O
soil O
covers O
. O

The O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
some O
only O
bloom O
short O
, O
but O
many O
bloom O
all O
summer O
long O
, O
until O
the O
first O
frost O
. O

For O
most O
climbing O
roses O
, O
especially O
when O
they O
stand O
against O
a O
wall O
, O
that O
is O
far O
from O
ideal O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
can O
only O
recommend O
you O
to O
go O
in O
rosary O
gardens O
and O
at O
rosary O
growers O
to O
look O
at O
the O
flowering O
roses O
and O
note O
which O
roses O
you O
prefer O
to O
see O
and O
how O
they O
are O
used O
there O
. O

You O
can O
also O
build O
a O
standalone O
rack O
with O
a O
few O
high O
pillars O
between O
which O
you O
stretch O
metal O
wires O
or O
apply O
a O
rackwork O
. O

Like O
all O
roses O
, O
climbing O
roses O
prefer O
a O
sunny O
position O
. O

A O
rose O
arc O
or O
pergola O
must O
, O
of O
course O
, O
be O
strong O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
carry O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
roses O
in O
rain O
and O
wind O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
, O
these O
" O
tree O
roses O
" O
need O
to O
be O
helped O
a O
little O
by O
attaching O
them O
around O
the O
trunk O
of O
the O
tree O
, O
but O
once O
they O
have O
reached O
the O
crown O
, O
they O
find O
their O
own O
way O
. O

I O
find O
them O
almost O
all O
beautiful O
. O

They O
also O
need O
to O
be O
used O
very O
regularly O
. O

If O
your O
garden O
lends O
itself O
, O
then O
you O
can O
better O
try O
to O
provide O
some O
construction O
specifically O
for O
your O
climbing O
roses O
. O

Best O
is O
therefore O
a O
wall O
in O
the O
east O
or O
west O
where O
they O
have O
at O
least O
about O
5 O
to O
6 O
hours O
of O
sunshine O
in O
the O
summer O
. O

No O
climbing O
rose O
can O
attach O
to O
a O
wall O
or O
something O
like O
, O
for O
example O
, O
climbing O
or O
wild O
winged O
. O

Not O
only O
are O
they O
difficult O
to O
fix O
at O
a O
sufficient O
distance O
from O
the O
wall O
, O
but O
in O
addition O
, O
after O
several O
years O
, O
the O
loops O
break O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
roses O
. O

What O
we O
call O
climbing O
roses O
are O
just O
bush O
roses O
that O
make O
long O
ramps O
and O
work O
up O
along O
all O
possible O
supports O
– O
trees O
, O
walls O
, O
arches O
, O
pillars O
. O

If O
the O
rose O
can O
hang O
over O
the O
roof O
, O
the O
garden O
house O
in O
the O
early O
summer O
turns O
into O
one O
blooming O
rose O
. O

One O
of O
a O
reader O
who O
found O
me O
very O
stupid O
that O
I O
did O
n’t O
know O
what O
butterfish O
was O
— O
he O
lay O
in O
filets O
with O
his O
fish O
farmer O
, O
he O
ate O
it O
regularly O
and O
it O
was O
very O
delicious O
. O

Or O
something O
like O
butterfish O
. O

If O
you O
stopped O
cooking O
too O
quickly O
, O
the O
flour O
did O
n’t O
work O
and O
the O
bark O
bread O
became O
sluggish O
. O

There O
could O
never O
have O
been O
cut O
out O
the O
filet O
he O
had O
on O
his O
plate O
. O

There O
are O
in O
total O
about O
fourteen O
now O
and O
some O
of O
them O
are O
here O
in O
commerce O
. O

Stupid O
, O
that O
I O
ca O
n’t O
say O
it O
with O
certainty O
— O
others O
do O
it O
more O
certain O
— O
but O
that O
’s O
how O
life O
seems O
to O
be O
. O

I O
’d O
rather O
bite O
my O
tongue O
than O
deceive O
you O
. O

They O
just O
do O
n’t O
get O
acquainted O
in O
their O
kitchen O
! O

There O
are O
even O
more O
names O
, O
such O
as O
carboet O
, O
tuet O
or O
panas O
and O
it O
exists O
strangely O
enough O
in O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
where O
it O
is O
usually O
made O
with O
cornmeal O
and O
is O
called O
scrapple O

Then O
there O
is O
the O

P. B-MISC

Pacific B-MISC

, O
all O
referred O
to O
as O
butterfish O
on O

Nothing O
should O
be O
thrown O
away O

To O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
: O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
fish O
you O
get O
on O
your O
plate O
and O
probably O
the O
cook O
does O
n’t O
know O
it O
, O
and O
the O
fish O
farmer O
did O
n’t O
know O
it O
either O
. O

That O

gave O

Poronotus B-MISC

the O

that O

" O
because O
the O

That O

So O
we O
set O
up O

that O
the O

indeed O

these O

find O
it O

This O

But O
that O

you O

put O

The O

And O
why O
does O
Chebbab B-ORG
find O

By O
the O
way O

a O

is O
not O
just O
an O

or O

But O
be O
careful O
, O
it O
’s O
an O
interaction O
, O
they O
need O
us O
as O
much O
as O
the O
reverse O
. O

The O
migration O
policy O
is O
still O
being O
carried O
out O
too O
much O
and O
too O
little O
by O
the O

We O
must O
learn O
to O
live O
with O
it O

many O
Flames O
throw O
us O
all O
on O
one O

How O
do O
we O
approach O

It O
is O
not O
because O
we O
will O
appoint O
a O
Turk B-MISC

Moroccan B-MISC
to O
the O
director O
of O
the O
VMC B-ORG
tomorrow O
that O
all O
issues O
of O

are O
immediately O
out O
of O
track O
. O
” O

In O
my O
view O
, O
it O
was O
an O
absurd O
situation O
. O

If O
they O
read O
in O
the O
newspaper O
that O
one O
Moroccan B-MISC
committed O
a O
theft O
, O
then O
suddenly O
all O
Moroccans B-MISC
are O
thieves O
. O

However O
, O
I O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
this O
debate O
lives O
mainly O
in O
the O
big O
cities O
. O

As O
an O
aperitif O
, O
I O
am O
treated O
on O
a O
dry O
but O
necessary O
introduction O
. O

Some O
went O
a O
step O
further O
and O
preached O
Arab B-MISC
pride I-MISC
as O
the O
path O
to O
emancipation O
. O

It O
is O
no O
coincidence O
that O
they O
are O
mainly O
against O
Johan B-PER
Leman I-PER
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
officers O
were O
afraid O
that O
their O
intervention O
would O
cause O
riots O
. O

The O
whole O
concept O
of O
integration O
is O
racist O
, O
xenophobic O
and O
humiliating O
, O
so O
a O
polemist O
fulminated O
somewhat O
pleonastically O
. O

An O
entire O
generation O
is O
threatened O
to O
be O
lost O
. O

We O
both O
made O
the O
same O
conclusion O
: O
in O
Lier B-LOC
there O
were O
no O
facilities O
for O
immigrant O
youth O
at O
all O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O

have O
their O
mouths O
full O
of O
integration O

it O
seems O
like O
they O
want O
to O
repair O

Six O
years O

established O
its O
own O
version O
of O
the O
Catholic O
Church O
: O
the O
Chinese B-ORG
Patriotic I-ORG
Church I-ORG
, O
which O
quashes O
the O
Pope O
as O
a O
foreign O

therefore O
unconstitutional O
authority O

recognizes O
the O
Communist O

the O

Some O
were O

executed O

others O

Leo B-PER

Such O
a O

benefit O

But O
does O
the O

offer O
anything O

As O
Gehry B-PER
himself O
said O
, O
“ O
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
it O
something O
festive O

something O

‘ O

” O

A O
powerful O
client O

architect O
who O
has O
to O
push O
his O

out O

can O
direct O
the O

though O
in O
a O

There O
is O
no O

in O

The O
financial O
impact O
of O
the O
EMP B-LOC
is O
so O
overwhelming O
that O
you O
’ll O
wonder O
if O
the O
museum O
does O
n’t O
miss O
its O
goal O
. O

The O

is O
just O
as O
ambitious O

So O
extravagant O
that O
the O

wonder O
whether O
they O
have O
now O

the O

( O

simply O
a O
“ O

, O
as O
an O
opponent O
expressed O
it O

The O
artifacts O
are O
in O
a O
sense O
the O
least O
important O

Suddenly O
you O
realize O
that O
it O
’s O
all O
about O
sex O
, O
drugs O
, O
and O
rock’n’roll O
, O
compressed O
into O
one O
design O
. O

The O
playless O
, O
wave O

shaped O
halls O
have O
something O
of O
a O
chameleon O
: O
although O
there O
are O
several O
permanent O
exhibition O
spaces O
, O
you O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
a O
museum O

can O
turn O
into O
a O
concert O
stage O
at O
any O
time O
, O

planned O

The O
EMP B-LOC
does O
not O
want O

wants O
to O

When O
Allen B-PER
claimed O
Gehry B-PER
to O
create O
an O
unprecedented O
spectacular O
design O
for O
his O
museum O
in O
1996 O

the O

most O
famous O

original O

already O

. O

Gehry B-PER
, O
who O
himself O
preferred O
classical O
music O
, O
hit O
a O
series O
of O
guitars O

played O
with O

, O
is O
divided O
over O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O

So O
extravagant O
too O
that O
Gehry B-PER
himself O
stated O
that O
it O
was O
a O
one O
- O
time O
project O
and O
that O
he O
would O
probably O
never O
build O
anything O

again O

Dispersed O

can O
get O
lost O
in O
anything O
that O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
subject O
from O
far O
or O
close O
. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
project O
, O
he O
was O
encouraged O
to O
push O
his O
boundaries O
further O
. O

In O
a O
sense O
, O
that O
is O
their O
problem O
. O

Edited O

Each O
visitor O
receives O
a O
small O
device O
and O
a O
headphone O
at O
the O
entrance O
, O
so O
that O
he O
can O
hear O
a O
commentary O
voice O
at O
every O
aspect O
of O
the O
spectacle O
and O
in O
the O
meantime O
can O
store O
and O
take O
information O
on O
a O

So O
extravagant O
that O
critics O
do O
n’t O
care O

clean O
up O

The O
original O

create O
a O
modest O
1,000 O

square O
- O
foot O
exhibition O
space O
for O
Allen B-MISC

grew O
into O

13,000 O

100 O

with O
side O
jumps O

He O
has O
nothing O
against O

designs O
but O
sees O
a O
problem O
in O
the O
lack O
of O
political O
clarity O
in O
the O
city O
, O
which O
doubts O
between O
international O
prestige O
and O
loyalty O
to O
the O

Gehry B-PER
may O
rather O
hope O
that O
his O
concrete O
music O
box O
will O
sing O
it O
out O
a O
little O
longer O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
project O
was O
to O
become O
a O
great O
memorial O
to O

Once O
Antonello B-PER

to O

his O
business O
from O
Sicily I-LOC

heard O
that O
King O

received O
a O
panel O
from O
the O
hand O
of O
John B-PER

Bruges I-PER
( O

, O
with O
oil O
painted O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
one O
could O
wash O
it O
, O
that O
it O
resisted O
every O
shock O

united O
all O
perfections O
in O
itself O

People O
with O
whom O
it O
does O
n’t O
matter O
whether O
you O
see O
them O
often O
or O
not O
, O
with O
whom O
you O
had O
a O
conversation O
yesterday O
that O
you O
can O
continue O
six O
months O
later O
. O

" O
There O
are O
already O
people O

have O
called O
, O

we O
're O
holding O
off O

a O
little O

I O
would O
beat O
with O
various O

“ O
They O
will O
never O

me O
there O

They O
take O
place O
there O
in O
summer O
and O
winter O
, O
in O
all O
kinds O
of O

But O
it O
is O
at O
least O
trying O

Three O
good O
actors O
against O
no O
one O
director O
that O
is O
worth O
it O
, O
or O
I O
should O
be O
terribly O
mistaken O
here O

The O
correct O
answer O
is O
: O
Willy B-PER
Thomas I-PER
in O
... O

In O
other O
words O
, O
it O
was O
well O
. O

You O
see O
it O
in O
football O
too O
: O
that O
mentality O
of O
' O
yes O
but O
we O
did O
our O
best O
... O
' O

Or O
are O
it O
the O
people O
who O
were O
not O
accepted O
for O
an O
actor O

training O
that O
then O
try O
to O
follow O
director O

school O

“ O
Here O
it O
is O
, O
yes O

That O
decision O
was O
made O
when O
we O
had O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
holiday O
home O
for O
a O
while O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
second O

Then O
I O
’m O
talking O
about O

. O

Those O
are O
the O
first O
heads O
of O
Jut B-PER
I O
think O
of O
. O
” O

This O
means O
that O
the O
noise O
insulation O
is O
virtually O
nonexistent O
. O

We O
then O
decided O
pretty O
quickly O
that O
I O
would O
apply O
for O
my O
pension O
earlier O
and O
that O
we O
would O
just O
go O

I O
’ve O
just O

often O
had O
to O
find O
that O
I O
did O

see O
a O

told O

It O
is O
only O
120 O

because O
there O
are O
no O

you O
can O
do O
it O
quickly O

two O

a O
half O
hours O

as O

I O
’ve O
seen O

I O
ask O

it O

Our O

on O
a O

in O
Goirle B-LOC

just O
across O

in O
the O

The O

when O

Leave O

very O
pleasant O

Gert B-PER
tells O
me O
a O
little O
blasphemously O
that O
he O
accidentally O
touched O
the O
red O

during O
the O

. O

Do O
you O
need O
to O
be O
a O

If O
it O

it O
would O

1990 O

we O
were O
n’t O
immediately O
excited O
. O

Gert B-PER
notices O
that O
our O
backband O
is O
running O
out O
again O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
the O
Belgian B-MISC
language O
skills O
are O
often O
overlooked O
. O

Who O
can O
stay O
unmoving O
with O
so O
much O

The O

No O

This O

out O

Suddenly O
the O

Rob B-PER

put O

Ten O

us O
that O

A O
frequently O
asked O
question O
is O
this O
: O
“ O
Did O
nothing O
ever O
disappear O
when O
you O
came O
back O
? O
” O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
we O
stayed O
in O
Hereford B-LOC
, O
near O
Wales B-LOC
. O

The O
basic O
idea O
behind O
all O
this O
? O

With O
English B-MISC
you O
get O
everywhere O
, O
but O
usually O
it O
is O
a O
plus O
if O
you O
can O
express O
yourself O
in O
the O
language O
of O
the O
country O
you O
live O
in O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
National B-LOC
Plant I-LOC
Garden I-LOC
could O
not O
be O
left O
behind O
. O

Is O
the O
system O
waterproof O
? O

At O
a O
rotonde O
, O
I O
notice O
a O
car O
coming O
from O
the O
right O
too O
late O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
, O
but O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
self O
- O
made O
. O

The O
wheel O
of O
the O
car O
is O
“ O
wrong O
” O
. O

In O
the O
late O
afternoon O
we O
flaned O
along O
the O
sea O
. O

Countless O
walkers O
use O
the O
zebra O
paths O
to O
cross O
, O
but O
no O
driver O
gets O
it O
in O
his O
mind O
to O
drive O
even O
faster O
. O

Mike B-PER
and O
Kim B-PER
picked O
up O
the O
cards O
. O

As O
usual O
, O
we O
explore O
the O

When O

we O

It O

Fuller B-MISC

greatest O
significance O
lies O
in O
the O
combination O

this O
from O
a O
urge O

How O

It O

a O

But O
gradually O

realized O
that O
Fuller B-MISC

quest O
was O
more O
than O

mostly O

such O
as O
the O

Fuller B-PER
immediately O
anticipated O

he O
made O
the O
decision O
to O
consider O
his O
work O

as O
an O
experiment O

In O
1962 O
he O
built O
a O
spectacular O

In O
anticipation O

, O
he O
designed O
his O
round O

also O
that O
