Because O
you O

Director O

called O
the O

it O

At O

that O

what O

Even O
now O
it O
is O
far O
from O
said O
that O

will O
also O
start O
against O

because O
the O

has O
Strupar B-PER

reasons O
: O
" O
Everyone O

have O
to O
make O
the O

But O
where O
for O
most O
positions O
the O
hierarchy O
is O
very O
clear O

so O
Marc B-PER
Wilmots I-PER
has O
to O
be O
half O

dead O
before O
Johan B-PER
Walem I-PER
gets O
his O

there O
is O
one O
position O
where O
one O
balances O
on O
a O
very O
tightrope O
to O
make O
a O
difference O
. O

In O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
general O
public O
, O
Nilis B-PER
has O
lost O
some O
credit O
with O
the O

team O
because O
of O
all O
the O
perils O
surrounding O
his O

But O
like O
Strupar B-PER
, O
he O
is O
not O
the O
fastest O
of O
all O

a O
flaw O
that O
analysts O
rubbed O
in O

to O
keep O
him O
out O

So O
in O
his O
last O
internationals O

he O
left O
a O
faint O
impression O

As O

How O

that O

shows O
a O

a O

smoking O

We O
need O
the O

It O
is O
not O
the O
duration O

A O

that O
is O
that O
people O

go O
under O

a O

also O
go O
under O
the O

Our O

it O

" O

The O
" O
landing O
jobs O
" O
provided O
for O
in O
the O
new O
agreement O
throw O
this O
fair O
principle O
completely O
overboard O
. O

In O
concrete O
terms O
, O
in O
my O
case O
, O
this O
means O
that O
from O
the O
age O
of O
50 O
I O
will O
earn O
approximately O
15,000 O
francs O
less O
net O
per O
month O
than O
most O
of O
my O
peers O
for O
the O
same O
work O
. O

I O
do O
not O
question O
the O
right O
of O
our O
Buddhist O
compatriots O
to O
apply O
for O
this O
recognition O
, O
since O
the O
constitution O
and O
law O
of O
1870 O
allows O
and O
made O
it O
possible O
for O
other O
beliefs O
as O
well O
. O

If O
there O
is O
such O
a O
big O
pot O
( O
those O
runways O
will O
cost O
many O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
) O
to O
distribute O
in O
our O
sector O
, O
then O
everyone O
should O
get O
his O
fair O
share O
and O
that O
is O
not O
happening O
at O
all O
. O

Use O
that O
money O
for O
initiatives O
to O
integrate O
foreign O
cultures O
, O
to O
build O
a O
multicultural O
society O
. O

I O
quote O
: O
" O
It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
system O
of O
landing O
strips O
is O
not O
accessible O
to O
personnel O
working O
part O
- O
time O
and O
I O
understand O
that O
you O
feel O
that O
is O
unfair O
. O

" O

However O
, O
I O
fear O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O
response O
. O

For O
the O
' O
ancien O
' O
half O
- O
timers O
, O
who O
thus O
never O
received O
any O
premium O
, O
it O
therefore O
becomes O
from O
50 O
years O
to O
retirement O
working O
at O
a O
favorable O
rate O
compared O
to O
peers O
who O
only O
then O
switch O
to O
half O
- O
time O
. O

But O
are O
n't O
we O
going O
down O
the O
wrong O
path O
? O

By O
my O
choice O
I O
also O
gave O
employment O
to O
one O
of O
the O
many O
unemployed O
at O
that O
time O
. O

When O
will O
the O
eighth O

, O
the O
ninth O
, O

ca O

is O

The O
explanation O
for O

in O

Upon O

some O
ten O

, O
the O

was O
quite O
well O
received O
by O
European B-MISC

The O
front O
( O

can O
be O
shifted O
over O
a O
distance O
of O
three O
centimeters O
, O
the O
rear O
can O
slide O
forward O
or O
backward O
up O
to O
eight O
centimeters O
. O

In O
the O
first O

is O
no O
third O

, O
in O
the O

case O

Quite O
a O

so O
, O
this O
Toyota B-ORG
. O

Ten O
years O
ago O
nobody O
would O
have O
made O
a O
problem O
of O
it O
, O
but O
today O
such O
airbags O
in O
the O
doors O
or O
the O
sides O
of O
at O
least O
the O
front O
seats O
have O
become O
commonplace O
, O
especially O
in O
a O
car O
of O
this O
caliber O
. O

If O
you O
have O
more O
passengers O
to O
transport O
, O
you O
should O
opt O
for O
the O
configuration O
with O
seven O
or O
eight O
seats O
. O

It O
then O
also O
drives O
the O
front O
wheels O
. O

Also O
with O
diesel O

But O
Toyota B-ORG
wo O
n't O
release O
any O
more O
information O
about O
it O
for O
now O
. O

The O
flanks O
are O
sufficiently O
strong O
to O
make O
such O
an O
additional O
safety O
feature O
unnecessary O
, O
it O
says O
. O

section O

Before O
that O
happens O
, O
however O
, O
a O
diesel O
engine O
must O
also O
be O
available O
. O

With O
the O
successor O
, O
which O
is O
already O
in O
the O
showrooms O
of O
the O
brand O
, O
the O
aim O
is O
much O
higher O
sales O
figures O
. O

Their O
seats O
can O
be O
moved O
forwards O
or O
backwards O
, O
while O
they O
can O
also O
be O
folded O
down O
or O
removed O
relatively O
easily O
. O

The O
theoretical O
average O
of O
9.5 O
liters O
per O
kilometer O
seems O
to O
confirm O
that O
, O
but O
during O
our O
test O
drive O
we O
did O
arrive O
at O
a O
much O
higher O
figure O
of O
12.5 O
and O
with O
the O
automatic O
even O
almost O
14 O
liters O
. O

In O
the O
flanks O
, O
equipped O
with O
two O
large O
sliding O
doors O
, O
there O
are O
some O
striking O
' O
kinks O
' O
and O
with O
the O
headlights O
extending O
over O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
hood O
and O
the O
' O
smiling O
' O
radiator O
grille O
the O
face O
also O
has O
a O
look O
that O
until O
recently O
would O
only O
have O
been O
expected O
on O
the O
prototypes O
of O
an O
international O
car O
show O
. O

The O
seats O
can O
not O
be O
rotated O
, O
but O
you O
can O
detach O
them O
and O
then O
reattach O
them O
in O
reverse O
. O

That O
simultaneously O
daring O
and O
beautiful O
design O
can O
also O
be O
found O
in O
the O
interior O
, O
with O
a O
dashboard O
that O
consists O
of O
a O
succession O
of O
curved O
and O
' O
overlapping O
' O
lines O
. O

Next O
year O
there O
would O
also O
be O
a O
so O
- O
called O
commercial O
version O
, O
without O
rear O
seats O
and O
therefore O
with O
the O
much O
lower O
taxes O
of O
a O
company O
car O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
there O
is O
not O
even O
a O
leather O
seat O
upholstery O
available O
only O
makes O
our O
doubts O
greater O
. O

The O
power O

is O
also O
completely O
new O
and O
has O
variable O
valve O
timing O
, O
a O
technological O
gimmick O
that O
provides O
better O
efficiency O
. O

Admittedly O
, O
we O
gave O
the O
car O
a O
lot O
of O
spurts O
, O
the O
air O
conditioning O
was O
working O
and O
the O
hilly O

was O

not O

Therefore O

the O

be O

Computer O

Ultimately O
, O
it O
is O
only O
in O
this O
way O
that O

are O
given O
the O

This O

, O
which O
had O
completely O
collapsed O
due O
to O
earthquakes O
, O
" O
says O

Ponti B-PER

Thus O
, O
historic O
buildings O
such O
as O
the O

be O

But O
now O
we O

test O
it O

the O

" O
But O
we O
are O

with O
the O
past O

What O
is O
still O
a O
problem O
in O
building O
copies O
of O

, O
is O
finding O
old O
materials O

So O
that O
the O
original O
and O
the O

now O
react O

in O
the O

We O
did O
that O

The O

was O
the O
too O
big O

" O
The O
idea O
of O
building O
a O

and O
subjecting O
it O
to O
shocks O
came O
from O
the O
Japanese B-MISC
in O
the O

We O

That O
defect O
in O
the O
gene O
is O
not O
a O
disease O
, O
it O
is O
normal O
in O
some O
of O
the O
Hampshire B-MISC
pigs I-MISC
, O
like O
a O
shorter O
or O
longer O
tail O
. O

Because O
during O
their O
lives O
, O
the O
pigs O
are O
fitter O
and O
fatter O
, O
but O
when O
their O
meat O
is O
cooked O

you O
keep O
even O
less O

The O

could O
be O
a O
breakthrough O
for O

But O
we O
are O
not O
there O
yet O
. O

The O
meat O
is O
also O
slightly O
more O
acidic O
, O
retains O
less O
water O
, O
and O
thus O
loses O
a O
lot O

volume O
if O
you O
want O
to O
make O
ham O

smoked O
meat O
from O
it O

The O

is O
also O
not O
transmissible O
to O
people O
who O
eat O
the O
meat O
, O
as O
with O
the O

For O
now O

We O

the O

When O
we O
examined O
their O

we O
saw O
that O
they O
had O
three O
times O
more O
sugar O
in O
their O

other O
pigs O
, O
so O
they O
had O
more O
energy O

their O

' O
Our O
preference O
for O
sweet O

if O

This O
has O
now O
changed O
with O
the O
study O
of O
Hildegard B-PER

, O
who O
recently O
received O
her O
doctorate O
at O
the O
KU B-ORG
Leuven I-ORG
for O
a O
thesis O
on O
alternative O
meaning O
. O

Hence O
perhaps O
this O
affinity O
with O
the O
alternative O
sector O
, O
the O
others O
among O
us O
. O

But O
if O
you O
add O
up O
what O
an O
active O
student O
puts O
in O
on O
a O
yearly O
basis O
, O
you O
soon O
come O
to O
a O
nice O
amount O

" O
German B-MISC
research O
shows O
that O
10 O
percent O
of O
all O
books O

focus O
on O
the O

sector O

New B-MISC
Agers I-MISC
are O
often O
accused O
of O
bricolage O

applying O
a O
kind O
of O

" O

Quite O
a O
few O
alternativeists O
make O
their O
profession O
out O
of O
what O
was O
once O
a O
hobby O
. O

For O
example O
: O
some O
people O
seem O
to O
attract O
problems O

But O
that O
also O
depends O
on O

' O
The O

hushed O
when O
it O
appeared O
that O
I O
was O
speaking O
seriously O
about O
it O

Because O
what O

another O

There O
you O
have O
to O

that O

up O

just O

dumped O
. O

You O
are O
a O
critical O

from O
the O

field O
and O
therefore O
you O
are O
not O
always O
taken O
seriously O
in O
the O
field O
. O

" O
There O
is O
also O
a O
dynamic O
in O
it O
that O
makes O

more O
expensive O

You O
get O
more O

you O

I O
also O
had O
some O

New B-MISC
Age I-MISC
, O
as O
it O
is O
called O
with O
a O
platitude O

widely O

often O
maligned O

In O
the O

will O
claim O

There O
is O
no O

no O

. O

She O
therefore O
likes O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
' O
alternative O
world O
' O
, O
because O
the O
meaning O
seekers O
concentrate O
mainly O
around O
all O
kinds O
of O

Van B-PER
Hove I-PER
was O
raised O
Protestant O
by O

The O
advantage O
is O
that O
the O
costs O
are O
widely O
spread O

that O
anyone O
can O
quit O
at O
any O
time O

Respected O
worldwide O
as O
a O

of O

, O
in O
Belgium B-LOC
often O
reviled O
for O
his O
open O
attitude O
towards O
new O

movements O
. O

You O
do O
your O
doctorate O
on O
an O
interesting O
subject O
, O
but O
also O
with O
a O
fascinating O
professor O
. O
And O
Dobbelaere B-PER
, O
now O
professor O

, O
is O
such O
a O
man O
. O

But O
what O
? O

The O
children O
have O
just O
left O
home O
, O
or O
are O
already O
a O
bit O
older O
. O

How O
big O
the O
alternative O
world O
is O
, O
nobody O
knows O
. O

" O

" O
Until O
they O
had O
a O
weird O
dream O
and O
came O
to O
me O
: O
' O
You O
know O
something O
about O
that O
, O
' O
they O
said O
. O

Everyone O
knows O
someone O
who O
does O
or O
has O
done O
yoga O
. O

" O

Many O
people O
learn O
to O
think O
about O
identity O
in O
the O
course O
. O

It O
should O
therefore O
come O
as O
no O
surprise O
that O
KU B-ORG
Leuven I-ORG
has O
now O
abolished O
the O
course O
in O
the O
sociology O
of O

. O

Van B-PER
Hove I-PER
actually O
ended O
up O
with O
the O
sociology O
of O

by O
chance O
. O

In O
Flanders B-LOC
there O
are O
few O
rabid O
New B-MISC
Agers I-MISC
, O
that O
is O
: O
few O
people O
who O
believe O
in O
the O
spontaneous O
arrival O
of O
a O
utopian O
world O
order O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
Age B-MISC

" O
I O
had O
gone O
to O
a O

" O
, O
says O
the O

" O
Bricolage O
requires O
an O
independent O
attitude O
" O
, O
says O
van B-PER
Hove I-PER
, O
who O
thus O
wants O
to O
put O
the O
criticism O
into O
perspective O
. O

Of O
women O
it O
is O
socially O
more O
easily O
accepted O
that O

engage O
in O

" O
No O

in O
Eastern O

Especially O
after O
one O
of O

after O

another O

Surely O
New B-MISC
Age I-MISC
is O
not O
scientific O
. O

And O
then O
I O
had O
to O
explain O
it O
. O

Then O
you O
come O
to O
two O
choices O
: O
either O
you O
keep O
taking O
classes O
, O
or O
eventually O
you O
start O
giving O
courses O
yourself O
, O
to O
keep O
in O
touch O
with O
people O
. O

" O

But O
that O
's O
not O
right O
at O
all O
. O

These O
in O
their O
original O
form O
require O
a O
long O
sustained O
effort O
and O
discipline O
. O

Light O
healing O
focuses O
on O
light O
as O
a O
healing O
force O
and O
there O
are O
references O
to O
divine O
light O
. O

The O
ability O
to O
share O
is O
essential O
. O

Women O
are O
more O
often O
found O
in O
courses O
in O
meditation O
and O
healing O
with O
crystals O
. O

They O
mock O
it O
less O
. O

" O
Mommy O
and O
Daddy O
are O
going O
to O
be O
weird O
" O
, O
the O
children O
sometimes O
say O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
competition O
is O
high O
, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
look O
for O
new O
students O
all O
the O
time O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
conviction O
, O
you O
can O
only O
keep O
it O
if O
there O
are O
people O
around O
you O
who O
share O
the O
same O
conviction O
. O

This O
is O
an O
American B-MISC
phenomenon O
that O
has O
already O
been O
surpassed O
. O

They O
also O
develop O
new O
visions O
by O
discovering O
interesting O
angles O
. O

" O
In O
foreign O
publications O
they O
all O
call O
this O
New B-MISC
Age I-MISC
, O
that O
's O
why O
I O
adopted O
that O
term O
. O

How O
does O
the O
seemingly O
chaotic O
world O
of O
the O
New B-MISC
Age I-MISC
work O
? O

" O
But O
it O
is O
exactly O
an O
age O
when O
you O
start O
asking O
yourself O
questions O
" O
, O
says O
Van B-PER

" O

People O
today O
go O
to O

lessons O
like O
they O
used O
to O
go O
to O
the O
brass O
band O

In O
part O
, O
of O

there O
's O
conviction O
behind O
it O
. O

But O
you O
also O
find O
engineers O
and O
soldiers O
or O
housewives O
there O
. O

The O
new O
market O
for O
meaning O
can O
only O
be O
successful O
if O
those O
interested O
actually O
get O
something O
out O
of O
it O
. O

The O
critics O
project O
an O
image O
of O
woolly O
followers O
, O
while O
the O
students O
are O
in O
reality O
quite O
active O
, O
critical O
people O

Moreover O
, O
sectarianism O
requires O
that O
there O
is O
only O
one O
truth O
. O

" O
And O
I O
was O
indeed O
amazed O
at O
the O
effects O
. O

The O
courses O
cost O
handfuls O
of O
money O
. O

The O
stigma O
of O
irrationality O
, O
the O
drifters O
. O

" O
Female O
academics O
were O
less O
critical O
of O
my O
interest O
in O
this O
subject O
. O

Is O
there O
a O
different O
market O
for O
meaning O
in O

than O
the O
Catholic O
one O
? O

The O
curious O
thing O
was O
that O
they O
told O
similar O
stories O
, O
while O
in O
this O
sector O
there O
is O
no O

" O
That O
's O
right O

says O
Van B-PER
Hove I-PER
, O
" O
although O
again O
it O
should O
n't O
be O
overestimated O

Only O
you O
do O
n't O
notice O
that O
right O
away O
. O

The O
big O
criticism O
of O
the O
alternative O
sector O
has O
to O
do O
with O
money O
. O

He O
feared O
that O
I O
would O
get O
too O
involved O
. O

They O
try O
to O
be O
more O
responsible O
for O
what O
they O
do O
. O

With O
the O
alternative O
students O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
rare O
that O
they O
can O
talk O
about O
it O
at O
home O
or O
at O
work O
. O

What O
have O
I O
actually O
accomplished O
in O
my O
life O
? O

But O
that O
attitude O
was O
not O
always O
appreciated O
in O
academic O
circles O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
no O
real O
drive O
to O
convert O
. O

They O
are O
building O
their O
own O
life O
story O
. O

The O
' O
alternative O
sector O
' O
is O
massively O
present O
: O
crystal O
healing O
courses O
, O
tarot O
card O
readings O
, O
bioenergetics O
, O
sweat O
lodge O
ceremonies O
, O

, O
tai O
- O
ji O
and O
so O
on O
. O

That O
was O
the O
start O
of O
the O
doctorate O
. O

The O
list O
is O
endless O
. O

In O
the O
western O
course O
form O
these O
disciplines O
are O
facilitated O
, O
so O
you O
can O
ask O
the O
question O
what O
is O
left O
of O
the O
original O
. O

On O
the O
negative O
side O
, O
bricolage O
often O
masquerades O
as O
the O
basic O
principles O
of O
the O
original O
disciplines O
. O

The O
average O
student O
is O
highly O
educated O
, O
40 O
to O
45 O
years O
old O
and O
probably O
a O
woman O
. O

In O
general O
you O
will O
find O
more O
women O
than O
men O
there O
. O

" O
For O
men O
it O
weighs O
more O
heavily O
to O
take O
those O
courses O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
was O
the O
academic O
world O
that O
you O
do O
not O
take O
seriously O
either O
, O
because O
you O
are O
investigating O
something O
' O
floating O
' O
. O

Religion O
there O
was O
perhaps O
more O
intrusive O
than O
in O
Catholic O
families O
, O
" O
and O
we O
knew O
we O
had O
a O
different O
religion O
than O
most O
people O
" O
, O
says O
Van B-PER
Hove I-PER
. O

The O
curious O
thing O
was O
that O
in O
my O
field O
of O
research O
it O
was O
just O
the O
opposite O
. O

" O
They O
do O
n't O
lose O
their O
personality O
. O

My O
supervisor O
was O
concerned O
about O
that O

As O
an O
academic O
you O
have O
to O
prove O
in O
your O
speaking O
that O
you O
are O
a O
rational O
person O
. O

They O
have O
to O
advertise O
, O
keep O
their O
students O
happy O
, O
invest O
. O

No O
, O
the O
rational O
liberal O
whose O
daughter O
is O
building O
a O
home O
altar O
, O
need O
not O
worry O
. O

The O
idea O
that O
you O
can O
learn O
from O
anyone O
is O
very O
much O
alive O
in O
the O
field O
by O
the O
way O
. O

Social O
contact O
becomes O
important O
again O
and O
that O
is O
sought O
in O
the O
alternative O
course O
. O

But O
in O
general O
, O
religiosity O
is O
not O
central O
. O

Others O
again O
find O
it O
positive O
that O
science O
is O
concerned O
with O
them O
, O
because O
in O
this O
way O
they O
might O
get O
rid O
of O
their O
stigma O
. O

" O
They O
are O
very O
ordinary O
people O
, O
often O
highly O
educated O
, O
with O
admittedly O
an O
overrepresentation O
from O
the O
health O
sector O
: O
nurses O
, O
psychotherapists O
and O
so O
on O
. O

They O
deal O
critically O
with O
the O
content O
of O
those O
courses O
. O

They O
do O
not O
end O
up O
in O
closed O
communes O
. O

" O

" O

For O
example O
techniques O
around O
health O
, O
or O
' O
how O
to O
become O
more O
resilient O
in O
a O
relationship O
' O
. O

I O
myself O
do O
not O
lie O
awake O
for O
that O
anymore O
. O

If O
you O
superficially O
attend O
a O
course O
, O
you O
would O
think O
that O
the O
attendees O
really O
swallow O
everything O
. O

" O
It O
's O
mainly O
about O
practical O
meaning O
. O

If O
you O
choose O
that O
angle O
, O
you O
can O
learn O
to O
appreciate O
people O
with O
problems O
. O

They O
often O
conceal O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
go O
to O
the O
course O
. O

Course O
participants O
from O
the O
alternative O
sector O
are O
roughly O
between O
20 O
and O
60 O
years O
old O
, O
with O
a O
peak O
around O
40 O
to O
45 O
years O
. O

So O
they O
need O
the O
circuit O
of O
courses O
to O
continue O
sharing O
that O
belief O
. O

What O
makes O
sense O
, O
you O
want O
to O
pass O
on O
. O

General O

And O
that O
's O
just O
as O
well O
. O

This O
difference O
was O
also O
noticeable O
at O
the O
university O

But O
participation O
in O

at O

every O

Recent O

indicate O
that O

will O
certainly O
be O
maintained O
in O
the O

However O
, O
the O
low O

also O
play O
a O
non O

role O

It O
therefore O
seems O
unlikely O
that O
supply O
will O
increase O
significantly O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
. O

This O
record O
level O
can O
be O
explained O
by O
several O
factors O
. O

While O
these O
small O
increases O
in O
production O
do O
not O
please O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
population O
, O
oil O
values O
are O
supported O
by O
the O
increase O
in O

prices O

Indeed O
, O
during O
the O
summer O
, O
a O
number O
of O
refineries O
are O
being O
repaired O

We O

: O
TotalFina B-ORG

However O
, O
it O

The O

From O

we O
do O
not O

consider O

a O

What O
did O
it O

, O
of O

' O
Winning O
nicely O

, O
that O

what O
it O

all O
about O

are O
talking O

in O

to O
shift O
the O

to O
Higher B-PER

, O
instead O

Journalists O
who O
followed O

told O
me O
that O
. O

" O
Oh O
well O
, O
it O

such O
a O
conservative O
world O
, O
that O
whole O
soccer O

could O
it O
get O
any O
more O
predictable O
? O

If O
they O
were O
each O
other O

equals O
in O
that O
area O
, O
they O
'd O
keep O
kicking O
until O
one O
missed O
and O
the O
other O
hit O
. O

That O
was O
entertainment O

saturday O

in O
Netwerk B-MISC
( O
a O
current O

on O
the O
NOS B-ORG
, O

. O

That O
is O
not O
logical O
. O

So O
, O
make O
sure O
all O
your O
players O
have O
mastered O
those O
techniques O
, O
before O
you O
start O
such O
a O

Until O
thirty O

Back O
then O
, O
four O

were O
missed O

" O

Questioned O
by O
Dutch B-MISC
journalists O
about O
what O
he O
would O
do O
now O
with O
Doctor O
Vergouwen B-PER
's O
advice O
, O
Rijkaard B-PER
mumbled O
that O
there O
would O
be O
" O
trained O
on O
penalties O
" O
. O

Because O
that O
is O
the O
only O
place O
where O
that O

can O
still O
go O
. O

Every O
movement O
, O
from O

, O
the O
look O
in O
the O
eye O
, O
the O
run O

up O
to O
the O
kick O
, O
should O
all O
be O
carefully O
rehearsed O
. O

Netherlands B-LOC
world O
champion O
. O
" O

' O
The O
answer O
was O
quickly O
found O
. O

Maybe O
that O
will O
loosen O
something O
up O
with O
the O
bobos O
of O
Dutch B-MISC
soccer O
. O
" O

They O
put O
the O
book O
aside O
. O

Laughed O
at O
maybe O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
Frank B-PER
de I-PER
Boer I-PER
run O
at O
that O
first O
penalty O
kick O
, O
I O
saw O
immediately O
that O
it O
was O
wrong O
. O

But O
that O
it O
is O
not O
even O
looked O
at O
? O

" O
Dutch B-MISC
people I-MISC
are O
addicted O
to O
Great B-MISC
Football I-MISC
moments I-MISC
. O

I O
noted O
that O
Orange B-ORG
is O
a O
well O
- O
run O
company O
that O
lacks O
something O
terribly O
important O
in O
terms O
of O
efficiency O
. O

76 O
percent O
. O

So O
he O
thought O
: O
it O
has O
to O
be O
high O
. O

Penalty O
kick O
for O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
in O
the O
very O
last O
minute O
. O

That O
's O
very O
deep O
in O
their O
minds O
. O

In O
1970 O
, O
Fifa B-ORG
introduced O
the O
shoot O
- O
out O
. O

He O
occasionally O
wakes O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
from O
a O
dream O
he O
first O
had O
as O
a O
thirteen O
- O
year O
- O
old O
boy O
. O

With O
that O
information O
in O
mind O
, O
it O
is O
not O
tenable O
to O
insist O
, O
like O
Johan B-PER
Cruijff I-PER
: O
' O
Penalty O
kicks O
, O
that O
's O
not O
soccer O
, O
that O
's O
psychology O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
train O
on O
that O
. O
' O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
" O
, O
he O
sighs O
. O

That O
was O
like O
a O
rowing O
team O
starting O
at O
the O
Olympics B-MISC
without O
oars O
. O

The O
way O
that O
one O
gently O
swung O
his O
standing O
leg O
, O
just O
before O
he O
printed O
: O
pure O
art O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
book O
will O
sell O
well O
now O
. O

" O
Did O
n't O
even O
flip O
through O
it O
. O

Then O
you O
feel O
around O
you O
that O
everyone O
has O
a O
fundamental O
question O
or O
need O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Five O
out O
of O
five O
. O
" O

If O
there O
was O
one O
moment O
in O
soccer O
history O
that O
showed O
it O
's O
not O
a O
lottery O
, O
it O
was O
now O
, O
right O
? O
" O

But O
to O
dismiss O
his O

mere O
ego O

tripping O
is O
all O
too O
simplistic O

that O
attitude O
is O
gradually O

though O
still O
very O
slowly O
, O
beginning O
to O
bear O
fruit O

Slowly O

What O
is O
certain O

that O

opinion O

edition O

But O
many O
Congolese B-MISC
will O
interpret O
his O

visit O

Kinshasa B-LOC
as O
a O
return O
of O
' O
l'oncle B-PER

' O
, O
who O
will O
now O
finally O
put O
things O
back O
in O

It O
may O
all O
seem O
a O
bit O
fishy O
, O
but O
by O
decisively O
choosing O
one O
side O
or O
the O
other O
, O
Michel B-MISC
's I-MISC
role O
as O
mediator O
would O
immediately O
be O
over O
. O

By O
understanding O
the O
security O
problems O
of O
Rwanda B-LOC
and O
Uganda O
, O
the O
door O
remains O
open O
there O
too O
. O

Whether O
he O
does O
that O
to O
end O
up O
in O
the O
history O
books O
or O
out O
of O
concern O
for O
the O
poor O
Congolese B-MISC

we O
could O
n't O
care O
less O

Belgium B-LOC
remains O
the O
most O
important O
trading O
partner O
of O
Congo B-LOC

but O
as O
an O
importing O
country O
Congo B-LOC
is O
only O
on O
the O
28th O
place O
, O
as O
an O
exporting O
country O
on O
the O
62nd O
place O
. O

Now O
Louis B-PER
Michel I-PER
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
most O
modest O
minister O
in O
the O
Belgian B-MISC
government O
. O

This O
was O
at O
odds O
with O
the O
policy O
that O
the O
then O
government O
pursued O
in O
respect O
of O
Kabila B-PER

and O
ultimately O
served O
no O
one O

Remains O
thus O
the O
possibility O
that O

This O
week O
he O
lectured O
party O
member O
Jef B-PER
Valkeniers I-PER

In O
this O
sense O

he O
positions O
himself O
as O
the O
liberal O
conscience O
. O

He O
sees O
no O
immediate O
reason O
to O
increase O
education O
finances O
with O
only O
linear O
wage O
increases O
or O
exit O
regulations O
as O
the O
goal O

De B-PER
Gucht I-PER
rightly O
made O
it O
a O
point O
of O
honor O
when O
he O
took O
office O
to O
keep O
the O
party O
members O
in O
the O
various O
governments O
and O
parliaments O
somewhat O
in O
check O
. O

Yet O
observers O
have O
a O
growing O
feeling O
that O
the O
committee O
concerned O
has O
become O
bogged O
down O
and O
the O
proposal O
may O
never O
see O
the O
light O
of O

After O
all O

his O
power O
base O
is O
narrow O

his O
charisma O
limited O

His O
premise O
is O
simple O

Flemish B-MISC

When O
we O
once O
confronted O
him O

replied O

a O
counter O

question O
. O

About O
Karel B-PER
De I-PER
Gucht I-PER
there O
are O
some O
nice O
jokes O
going O
around O

That O
might O
well O
indicate O
a O
philosophical O
blindness O

It O
is O
nevertheless O
remarkable O
that O
A0galev O

fraction B-MISC
leader I-MISC
in O
the O
Flemish B-MISC
Parliament O
Ludo B-PER
Sannen I-PER
had O

ten O

faxed O
the O
cabinet O
of O
federal O
Agalev B-MISC
minister I-MISC
Magda B-PER
Aelvoet I-PER
the O
relevant O
texts O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O

has O
started O
to O
improve O
the O
social O
status O
of O
the O
self O

employed O

how O
on O

it O
possible O
that O

whether O

A O
condition O

a O
Messiah B-PER

the O
child O
who O
would O
bring O

back O

the O
promised O

a O
sign B-MISC
that O
the O

Now O
that O
would O
be O
a O
true O

As O
was O
to O
be O
expected O
, O
Fidel B-PER
Castro I-PER
across O
the O
Straits B-LOC
of I-LOC
Florida I-LOC
refused O
to O
cooperate O
with O
such O
a O
radical O
scenario O
, O
preferring O
to O
portray O
the O
boy O
as O
the O
lost O
and O
kidnapped O
innocence O

the O
foundation O
for O
mobilizing O

restoring O
the O

badly O
battered O
by O
the O
economic O

the O
growing O
social O

Do O
the O
people O
of O
Miami B-LOC
hate O
Castro B-PER
more O
than O
they O
love O
Elián B-PER

Just O
a O

I O
admit O
that O
both O
developments O
on O
either O
side O
of O
the O
divided O
Cuban B-MISC
nation O
have O
only O
a O
very O
small O
chance O
of O
success O
. O

For O
example O
, O
there O
are O
books O
that O
Elián B-PER
and O
his O
school O
friends O
will O
never O
be O
able O
to O
read O
, O
masterpieces O
by O
Cuban B-MISC
authors O
in O

for O
example O

such O
as O
Cabrera B-PER
Infante I-PER

Reynaldo B-PER

in O
America B-LOC
, O
Cuban B-MISC
refugee O
Elián B-PER
Gonzalez I-PER
is O
back O
in O
his O
native O
country O
. O

Do O
they O
not O
have O
the O
right O
to O
decide O
for O
themselves O
what O
is O
dangerous O

what O
is O

Of O

it O
would O

best O
to O
just O
leave O

not O

I O
can O
reason O
all O
this O
out O

Whether O

can O
use O
the O

group O
of O

in O

run O

up O

the O

The B-MISC
Life I-MISC

In O
the O
Flemish B-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
there O
will O
still O
be O
a O
tough O
discussion O
about O
the O
finch O
catch O
. O

However O
, O
Denys B-PER
notes O
that O
very O
heavy O
efforts O
have O
been O
made O
in O
recent O
years O
to O
promote O
the O
breeding O
of O
finches O
, O
but O
that O
the O
breeding O
process O
in O
finches O
is O
so O
delicate O
that O
the O
number O
of O
finches O
bred O
so O
far O
is O
still O
insufficient O
to O
supply O
the O
approximately O
20,000 O
finchers O
. O

The O
political O
wrangling O

while O

that O
the O

Freddy B-PER
had O
his O
eyes O
open O

he O
saw O
nothing O

" O
He O

not O
going O

Nico B-PER
" O
, O
she O
whispered O
then O
. O

It O
was O
not O
convincing O
. O

The O
heart O
monitor O
beeped O
softly O
, O
the O
bumps O
that O
indicated O
the O
heartbeat O
slowly O
became O
regular O
. O

He O
felt O
the O
shudder O
of O
the O
body O
that O
wanted O
to O
reject O
him O
but O
no O
longer O
had O
the O
energy O
for O
it O
. O

Nico B-PER
felt O
a O
tremendous O
longing O
for O
his O
own O
wife O
. O

He O
could O
also O
call O
here O
. O

He O
kissed O
Marianne B-PER
on O
her O
neck O
. O

It O
was O
halfway O
through O
the O
first O
half O
, O
Frank B-PER

Boer I-PER
had O
yet O
to O
miss O
his O
penalty O
kick O
, O
when O
suddenly O
Freddy B-PER
started O
screaming O
. O

He O
looked O
at O
his O
son O
's O
white O
feet O
sticking O
out O
from O
under O
the O
sheet O
. O

It O
reminded O
him O
of O
vacations O
they O
had O
spent O
together O
. O

He O
stood O
still O
in O
the O
doorway O
. O

Also O
now O
. O

She O
guided O
his O
overwhelming O
erection O
into O
her O
warm O
tunnel O
and O
then O
put O
her O
hands O
on O
his O
buttocks O
. O

" O
I O
ca O
n't O
make O
it O
" O
, O
Marianne B-PER
sobbed O
. O

They O
both O
silently O
undressed O
. O

" O
No O
, O
" O
Marianne B-PER
said O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
sound O
convincing O
. O

So O
for O
minutes O
they O
looked O
down O
at O
what O
was O
left O
of O
their O
little O
son O
. O

" O
I O
'll O
go O
" O
, O
said O
Marianne B-PER
, O
who O
also O
got O
up O
. O

Although O
it O
made O
no O
sense O
, O
he O
could O
do O
nothing O
for O
Freddy B-PER
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
go O
up O
anyway O
. O

Freddy B-PER
had O
been O
lying O
there O
for O
weeks O
now O
. O

He O
did O

want O

he O
wanted O
it O
to O
stop O
for O
Freddy B-PER

for O
Marianne B-PER

She O
tasted O
like O

then O
at O

Nico B-PER

if O
it O

In O

it O

Surely O
you O

claim O

anything O

Then O
you O

two O

more O

De B-PER

" O
That O
's O
true O

a O

De B-PER
Grauwe I-PER
: O
" O
Our O
ideas O
are O
not O
that O
far O
apart O

What O
can O
we O
do O
about O
it O
? O

Louis B-PER
Michel I-PER
stated O
before O
the O
elections O
that O
international O
forms O
of O
taxation O
are O
in O
line O
with O
the O
evolution O
. O

The B-MISC
Financial I-MISC
Morning I-MISC

The O
big O
supporters O
of O
development O
aid O
are O
the O
NGOs O
and O
Belgian B-MISC
industry O
. O

There O
is O
a O
huge O
difference O
in O
the O
taxation O
of O
labor O
and O
that O
of O
capital O
: O
more O
taxation O
of O
capital O
, O
such O
as O
a O
Tobin B-MISC
tax O
, O
should O
allow O
lower O
charges O
on O
labor O
. O
" O

The O
paradox O
is O
that O
the O
speculators O
have O
loopholes O
, O
we O
are O
hardly O
going O
to O
hit O
them O
with O
the O
tax O
, O
while O
the O
others O
will O
pay O
. O

In O
the O
Mexican B-MISC
crisis O
in O
1994 O
the O
IMF B-ORG
intervened O
quickly O
because O
the O
US B-LOC
wanted O
it O
. O

Are O
you O
saying O
that O
there O
is O
no O
line O
in O
the O
IMF B-MISC
action I-MISC

Bill B-PER
Gates I-PER
can O
live O
as O
well O
on O
1 O

as O
on O
30 O

. O

That O
's O
a O
breakthrough O
though O
it O
remains O
that O
the O
IMF B-ORG
makes O
the O
decisions O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
levy O
can O
do O
anything O
against O
financial O
instability O
. O

Even O
more O
curious O
is O
that O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
and O
the O
IMF B-ORG
now O
present O
themselves O
as O
agencies O
engaged O
in O
poverty O

. O

We O
need O
to O
go O
to O
a O
series O
of O
fiscal O
reforms O
. O

Is O
it O
a O
coincidence O
that O
Broederlijk B-ORG
Delen I-ORG
after O
the O
debt O
crisis O
is O
now O
also O
working O
with O
the O
Tobin B-MISC

around O
that O
theme O
? O

We O
should O
also O
not O
be O
under O
too O
many O
illusions O
about O
the O
proceeds O
of O
the O

In O
part O

these O
are O

Taxing O
away O
? O

Another O
recent O
example O
of O
large O
returns O
on O
money O
is O
the O
stock O
market O
: O
some O
people O
became O
very O
rich O
there O
in O
a O
few O
years O
. O

De B-PER
Grauwe I-PER
: O
" O
The O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
worldwide O
has O
undoubtedly O
increased O
that O
kind O
of O
inequality O
. O

De B-PER
Grauwe I-PER
: O
" O
That O
story O
is O
simple O
, O
although O
I O
do O
n't O
claim O
that O
it O
is O
attractive O
: O
in O
a O
world O
that O
is O
fully O
integrated O
, O
people O
with O
good O
ideas O
, O
unique O
sportsmen O
or O
artists O
will O
be O
well O
compensated O

" O

Question O
is O
: O
how O
do O
you O
do O
that O
? O
" O

A O
kind O
of O
Russian B-MISC
revolution O
? O
" O

Bode B-PER
: O
" O
That O
's O
also O
the O
idea O
behind O
the O
jubilee O
year O
: O
it O
's O
about O
the O
excesses O
. O

Bode B-PER
: O
" O
Legally O
you O
may O
be O
right O
but O
in O
practice O
the O
real O
repayments O
are O
so O
huge O
that O
countries O
are O
in O
a O
stranglehold O
. O
" O

Gates B-PER
can O
indeed O
live O
with O
1 O
billion O
dollars O
but O
that O
is O
already O
very O
drastic O
. O

Something O
also O
seems O
to O
be O
moving O
at O
those O
institutions O
, O
at O
least O
in O
the O
rhetoric O
. O

All O
the O
UN B-MISC
conferences I-MISC
of O
the O
1990s O
led O
to O
good O
action O
plans O
but O
there O
was O
no O
money O
to O
implement O
them O
. O
" O

So O
it O
is O
not O
correct O
to O
say O
that O
the O
IMF B-ORG
has O
failed O
globally O
. O
" O

publication O

De B-PER
Grauwe I-PER
: O
" O
It O
is O
not O
because O
someone O
has O
made O
a O

that O
he O
proclaims O

That O

down O

The O
IMF B-ORG
provided O
an O
implicit O
guarantee O
to O
international O
creditors O
over O
the O
past O
decade O
that O
they O
would O
see O
their O

back O

That O
's O
about O
canceling O

freeing O

and O
distributing O

The O
reason O
why O
that O
levy O
( O
a O
very O
small O
levy O
on O
the O
exchange O
of O
money O
, O
nvdr O
) O
resurfaced O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O

the O
many O
financial O
crises O

That O
it O
can O
be O
there O
in O
the O
future O

I O
do O
not O

Many O
people O
are O
ethically O

Some O
called O

" O
I O
do O

dispute O
that O
it O

That O

why O
I O

the O
opposition O
to O
such O

small O

" O

Bode B-PER
: O
" O
On O
the O
technical O
discussion O
I O
will O
not O
go O
deeper O

All O
that O
remains O
is O
that O
it O
can O
be O
a O
source O
of O
income O
to O
do O
all O
sorts O
of O
fun O
things O
with O

I O
doubt O
that O
those O

would O
just O
hand O
over O
that O
money O
to O
an O
international O

" O

Personally O
I O
think O
that O
the O
levy O
as O
a O
source O
of O
income O
is O
the O
most O
attractive O
side O
of O
the O
matter O
. O

Even O
more O
obvious O
is O
that O
people O
kept O
lending O
money O
to O
the O
kleptomaniac O
Mobutu B-PER
because O
he O
was O
considered O
by O
the O

Central B-LOC
Africa I-LOC

" O

De B-PER
Grauwe I-PER
: O
" O
In O
my O
opinion O
, O
no O
. O

In O
the O
Asian B-MISC
crisis O
, O
Western O
banks O
were O
bailed O
out O
by O
the O
IMF B-ORG
while O
the O
ordinary O
Thai B-MISC
did O
have O
to O
swallow O
loss O

Aversion O
to O
high O
returns O
on O
money O
-- O
usury O
so O
to O
speak O
-- O
is O
an O
old O
Christian O
tradition O

The O
Cold B-MISC
War I-MISC
and O
economic O
interests O
played O
a O
major O
role O
in O
this O
. O

The O
market O
can O
do O
a O
lot O
, O
but O
does O
not O
make O
social O
corrections O

" O

According O
to O
you O
the O
social O
consequences O
of O
the O
Asian B-MISC
crisis O
are O
over O
? O

Internationally O
there O
is O
no O
jurisdiction O
that O
gives O
the O
creditor O
the O
power O
to O
claim O
things O
in O
another O
country O
. O

Look O
at O
the O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG
which O
already O
has O
a O
political O
infrastructure O
and O
where O
fiscal O
agreements O

do O

work O

this O
is O
illusion O

the O

" O

There O
I O
do O
partly O
follow O
your O

statement O

You O
can O
wonder O
if O
that O

The O
IMF B-ORG
promises O
to O
stop O
working O
with O

universal O
model O
of O
structural O
adjustment O

to O
look O
at O
what O
is O
effectively O
needed O
country O
by O
country O
and O
in O
consultation O
with O
civil O
society O

The O
jubilee O
year O
from O
the O

proposes O
a O
kind O
of O
redistribution O
every O
fifty O

That O
even O
ties O
in O
with O
the O
original O

idea O
where O
everyone O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
free O
access O
and O
equal O
opportunities O

We O

can O
get O
much O
more O
than O
others O
, O
without O
the O
differences O
becoming O
too O
stark O

There O
is O
another O
paradox O
. O

Precisely O
because O
creditors O
are O
so O
strong O
, O
the O
legislation O
makes O
corrections O
to O
protect O

The O
result O
is O
that O

" O

Does O
that O

Would O

it O

better O

set O

There O
is O
the O
aversion O
to O

that O
makes O
money O
. O

When O
the O
IMF B-ORG
now O
talks O
about O
poverty O

, O
is O
it O
not O
because O
poverty O
has O
increased O
in O
many O

where O
its O
rules O

been O
applied O

Africa B-LOC

1,500 O
billion O
dollars O
exchange O

per O

, O
that O
's O
an O
unimaginable O
amount O

The O
next O
step O
is O
to O
formalize O
that O
and O
officially O
cancel O
that O
debt O

" O

But O
what O
are O
we O
going O
to O
do O
with O
that O
? O

If O
those O
institutions O
get O
new O
tasks O
, O
they O
must O
be O
democratized O
. O
" O

At O
the O
national O
level O
, O
the O
creditor O
has O
a O

a O
whole O

force O

" O
I O

to O
emphasize O
that O
what O
I O
print O

printed O
in O
black O

I O
feel O
connected O
to O
it O
, O
in O
the O

case O

I O
love O
it O

I O
tell O
whoever O

about O

But O
I O
soon O
find O
out O
that O
many O

afraid O

are O
dyed O

wool O

travelers O

most O
of O
whom O
have O
dozens O

of O
mercury O
splattered O
from O
a O

and O
now O
driven O
by O

. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
other O
students O
are O
already O
high O
in O
the O
air O
, O
while O
we O
remain O
behind O
gritting O
our O
teeth O
. O

Now O
I O
had O
expected O
to O
find O
among O
the O
participants O
mainly O
people O
who O
had O
never O
flown O
. O

The O
stewardesses O
are O
an O
Indian B-MISC

with O
teeth O
like O
the O
Taj B-LOC

and O
a O

Never O

' O
Here O
we O
go O

ho O
' O
, O
would O
have O
roared O
through O
the O
intercom O
just O
before O
take O

off O
. O

There O
are O
even O
people O
who O
are O
over O
the O
moon O
on O
the O
guided O
flight O
, O
but O
hardly O
dare O
to O
board O
again O
the O
first O
time O
after O
that O
' O

" O
But O
in O
Europe B-LOC
there O
is O
so O
much O
more O

I O
could O
finally O

that O
no O
less O
than O
two O
out O

, O
that O

an O

not O

that O
this O
Kircher B-PER
was O
a O
half O

witted O
quack O
, O
by O

Similarly O
, O
the O
work O
of O
Mona B-PER
Hatoum I-PER
has O
that O
little O
something O
extra O
that O
knocks O
you O
out O

writes O
Küng B-PER

In O

very O
complex O

Whether O

edition O

It O
is O
notable O
, O
however O
, O
that O
Küng B-PER
relied O
heavily O
on O
Swiss B-MISC
artists O
in O
the O
composition O
of O
his O
exhibition O
and O
overlooked O
some O
obvious O
choices O
. O

A O
lady O
stepped O
inside O
, O
had O
not O
seen O
the O
small O
islands O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
. O

Some O
artists O
take O
a O
more O
modest O
attitude O
and O
portray O
their O
observations O
and O
experiences O
of O
everyday O
reality O
as O
modern O
cartographers O
. O

In O
1577 O
the O
Antwerp B-MISC
print O
publisher O
Philip B-PER
Galle I-PER
published O
the O
maps O
from O
the O
Theatrum B-MISC
in O
reduced O
form O
with O
texts O
set O
in O
verse O
. O

Also O
his O
contemporary O
Andreas B-PER
Cellarius I-PER
must O
have O
been O
a O
very O
well O
- O
read O
man O
, O
but O
he O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
more O
of O
a O
skywalker O
than O
an O
alchemical O
digger O
for O
unknown O
mineral O
resources O
. O

" O
All O
the O
maps O
of O
his O
atlas O
are O
shown O
at O
the O
same O
scale O
, O
so O
that O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
area O
shown O
, O
e.g. O
a O
desert O
or O
an O
ocean O
, O
there O
are O
almost O
blank O
pages O
. O

The O
public O
shared O
his O
opinion O
, O
because O
in O
the O
same O
year O
a O
new O
edition O
of O
' O
the O
theater O
of O
the O
world O
' O
appeared O
. O

So O
the O
mental O
distance O
between O
the O
authors O
of O
the O
works O
displayed O
, O
despite O
the O
centuries O
that O
separate O
them O
, O
is O
very O
small O
. O

His O
embroidered O
world O
map O
, O
of O

eight O
different O

Almost O
literally O
happened O
during O
my O
visit O
to O
the O
little O
room O
where O
Hatoum B-PER
has O
created O
a O
world O
map O
with O
a O
countless O
number O
of O
glass O
marbles O
. O

Five O
monitors O
with O
the O

outward O
form O
a O
spherical O
whole O
. O

The O
famous O
atlas O
of O
Ortelius B-PER
' O
contemporary O
Mercator B-PER
was O
initially O
not O
so O
popular O
, O
but O
his O
projection O
method O
is O
still O
used O
. O

Hidden O
in O
that O
observation O
is O
the O
unspoken O
notion O
that O
this O
is O
not O
always O
the O
case O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
' O
diaries O
' O
of O
On B-PER
Kawara I-PER
, O
Christoph B-PER
Fink I-PER
can O
also O
be O
mentioned O
in O
this O
context O
. O

Actually O
, O
the O
work O
with O
the O
marbles O
of O
Hatoum B-PER
is O
related O
to O
Broodthaers B-PER
' O
work O
. O

I O
had O
to O
laugh O
, O
not O
out O
of O
schadenfreude O
, O
but O
because O
you O
could O
disrupt O
the O
world O
order O
with O
a O
careless O
misstep O
. O

Tuerlinckx B-PER
's O
work O
is O
not O
cartographic O
, O
there O
is O
no O
paper O
, O
rulers O
and O
compasses O
, O
but O
it O
does O
relate O
in O
a O
sensuous O
, O
indirect O
way O
to O
this O
earth O
as O
a O
celestial O
body O
in O
our O
solar O
system O
. O

I O
blinked O
my O
eyes O
and O
saw O
in O
a O
flash O
the O
whole O
world O
disintegrating O
into O
colliding O
elementary O
particles O
, O
atoms O
so O
to O
speak O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
of O
Orbis B-MISC
Terrarum I-MISC
hangs O
his O
famous O
colorful O
world O
map O
. O

The O
geopolitical O
reality O
that O
this O
map O
represents O
is O
transformed O
by O
a O
small O
correction O
into O
a O
large O
poetic O
universe O
without O
borders O
. O

However O
, O
Küng B-PER
has O
created O
a O
context O
that O
fuels O
curiosity O
about O
this O
somewhat O
hermetic O
work O
. O

This O
is O
particularly O
evident O
in O
the O
so O

, O
one O
of O
the O

an O

But O
I O
do O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
comment O
on O
this O
. O

As O
with O
any O
genre O
, O
you O
have O
to O
respect O
certain O
rules O
and O
follow O
certain O
conventions O
. O

" O

I O
prefer O
the O
second O
approach O

And O
if O
you O
give O
something O
away O
for O
free O
, O
it O
is O
not O
taken O
care O
of O
afterwards O
anyway O
. O
" O

" O
But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
it O
is O
a O
story O
that O
dates O
back O
to O
ancient O
times O
, O
when O
there O
were O
no O
airplanes O
. O

You O
can O
approach O
such O
a O
situation O
in O
a O
very O
serious O
way O
or O
you O
can O
make O
a O
joke O
about O
it O
. O

" O
Among O
other O
things O
, O
what O
appeals O
to O
me O
so O
much O
in O
the O
work O
of O
Faulkner B-PER
and O
García B-PER
Márquez I-PER
is O
that O
they O
do O
not O
use O
the O
real O
world O
. O

The O
result O
is O
a O
funny O
and O
colorful O
, O
excited O
and O
exciting O
combination O
of O
fairy O
tale O
and O
road O
movie O
, O
in O
which O
fat O
bellies O
can O
speak O
, O
double O

buses O
appear O
at O
the O
most O
unexpected O
moments O
, O
highwaymen O
( O
or O
are O
they O

) O
drive O
around O
in O
tanks O
and O
a O
cow O
falls O
from O
the O
sky O
during O
a O
wedding O
. O

So O
it O
is O
not O
very O
surprising O
that O
director O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
has O
been O
described O
here O
and O
there O
as O

Probably O

he O

Does O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
have O
a O
problem O
with O
medics O
? O

" O
I O
see O
my O

very O
much O

I O

I O

Luna B-MISC

of O
the O
title O
. O

" O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
do O
understand O
why O
people O
make O
that O
comparison O
between O
Emir B-PER
and O
me O
. O

The O
story O
begins O
in O
a O
small O
village O
near O
Samarkand B-LOC
, O
where O
seventeen O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Mamlakat B-PER
dreams O
of O
a O
career O
as O
an O
actress O
. O

In O
any O
case O
I O
am O
not O
influenced O
by O
the O
films O
of O
Kusturica B-PER
, O
even O
though O
I O
think O
he O
is O
an O
excellent O
director O
. O

And O
so O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
tragicomedy O
, O
helped O
me O
in O
that O
decision O
. O
" O

When O
I O
tell O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
that O
his O
' O
fantastic O
realism O
' O
also O
has O
some O
affinity O
with O
what O
we O
in O
Belgium B-LOC
call O
' O
magic O
realism O
' O
, O
an O
art O
movement O
that O
can O
be O
found O
in O
our O
painting O
, O
our O
literature O
and O
in O
our O
films O
, O
he O
spontaneously O
starts O
talking O
about O
a O
Belgian B-MISC
film O
he O
has O
seen O
, O
a O
love O
story O
with O
a O
girl O
driving O
a O
streetcar O

One O
last O
question O
: O
why O
was O
Luna B-MISC
Papa I-MISC
dedicated O
to O
' O
our O
mothers O
' O
? O

This O
dedication O
is O
my O
way O
of O
thanking O
her O
for O
everything O
she O
has O
done O
for O
me O
. O

" O
For O
me O
this O
is O
a O
real O
story O
, O
" O
emphasizes O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
. O

I O
am O
much O
more O
influenced O
by O
literature O
, O
for O
example O
the O
novels O
of O
William B-PER
Faulkner I-PER
and O
Gabriel B-PER
García I-PER
Márquez I-PER
. O

Each O
artist O
makes O
his O
own O
country O
. O

Well O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
they O
laugh O
at O
psychology O
then O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
result O
is O
far O
from O
chaotic O
, O
because O
if O
you O
look O
closely O
-- O
for O
example O
, O
at O
the O
scene O
where O
a O
double O
- O
decker O
, O
a O
herd O
of O
running O
horses O
and O
one O
of O
the O
main O
characters O
are O
in O
the O
picture O
together O
-- O
you O
have O
to O
conclude O
that O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
kept O
things O
pretty O
much O
under O
control O
. O

But O
since O
there O
are O
not O
that O
many O
tragicomedies O
being O
made O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
directors O
working O
in O
the O
same O
genre O
would O
be O
associated O
with O
each O
other O
. O

One O
evening O

intimately O

you O

that O

why O
I O
prefer O
to O
leave O

out O

it O

why O
the O

describes O
the O
colorful O

in O
Luna B-MISC

as O
' O

the O

In O
Luna B-MISC
Papa I-MISC
a O
doctor O
is O
thrown O
out O
of O
a O
train O
at O
one O
point O
and O
earlier O
a O
gynecologist O
was O
fatally O
hit O
by O
a O
stray O
bullet O
. O

And O
so O
my O
screenwriter O
and O
I O
used O
that O
as O
a O
dramaturgical O
element O
for O
this O
film O
. O
" O

Thousands O

Mamlakat B-PER

Still O
, O
in O
retrospect O
, O
I O
learned O
a O
lot O
from O
that O
about O
image O
, O
colors O
and O
composition O
. O

Something O
about O
god O
and O
machine O
? O

Three O
totally O
different O
cineastes O

" O
For O
me O
philosophy O
-- O
or O
feel O
free O
to O
call O
it O
anthropology O
-- O
is O
about O
the O
human O
being O
, O
whereas O
psychology O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
about O
building O
barriers O
, O
about O
getting O
results O
, O
about O
winning O
in O
relationships O
. O

" O
That O
's O
right O
. O

what O
do O
you O
call O
it O
again O
? O

It O
was O
the O
period O
of O
perestroika O
: O
everything O
had O
to O
be O
free O
and O
so O
you O
could O
really O
do O
anything O
. O

But O
he O
did O
decide O
that O
' O
something O
' O
was O
going O
to O
fall O
out O
of O
that O
plane O
. O

Another O
example O
of O
an O
economic O
paradox O
is O
that O
the O
great O
wealth O
of O
America B-LOC
implies O
that O
some O
other O
countries O
are O
very O
poor O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
gynecologist O
, O
while O
licking O
an O
ice O
cream O
at O
a O
stall O
of O
note O
, O
is O
hit O
by O
a O
stray O
bullet O
, O
is O
commented O
on O

' O

Really O
happened O
or O
not O
, O
in O
any O
case O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
illustration O
of O
Khudojnazarov B-MISC
's I-MISC
thesis O
that O
the O
current O
situation O
in O
Central B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
, O
where O
tradition O
and O
superstition O
collide O
with O
the O
chaos O
of O
the O
postmodern O
world O
, O
is O
such O
that O
the O
reality O
there O
is O
just O
' O
fantastic O
' O
. O

With O
film O
, O
so O
many O
different O
elements O
come O
together O
. O

It O
is O
ab O
- O
so O
- O
lutely O

Tajikistan B-LOC

Márquez B-PER
talks O
about O
the O
city O

and O
then O
all O
kinds O
of O
things O
happen O
there O

The O
man O
has O
made O
a O
film O
that O
transcends O
European B-MISC
borders O

" O

And O
so O
that O
's O
why O
it O
became O
' O
our O
mothers O
' O
. O
" O

In O
short O
, O
I O
then O
learned O
a O
lot O
about O
the O
music O
of O
the O
film O
. O

So O
her O
father O

her O
pleasantly O

-- O
apparently O
a O
result O
of O
the O
war O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
-- O
did O
not O
understand O
. O

We O
then O
tried O
to O
make O
something O
that O
actually O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
film O

Or O
if O
necessary O
then O
try O
to O
use O
that O
mood O

something O
else O

" O
Emir B-PER

I O
are O
good O
friends O

But O
where O
is O

I O
have O
nothing O

do O
with O
it O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
hear O
about O
that O
foreign O
republic O

Does O
that O
imply O
a O
statement O
about O
abortion O
? O

Even O
if O
you O
run O
in O
a O
studio O
, O
where O
you O
can O
control O
the O

you O
still O

Similarly O

I O
use O
a O
town O

somewhere O
in O
Central B-LOC

' O
. O

When O
I O
tell O
him O
he O
's O
talking O
about O
Manneken B-MISC

I O
have O
to O
write O

Somewhere O
in O
Central B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
a O
large O
bull O
was O
stolen O
by O

But O
when O
the O
film O
crew O
heard O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
dedicate O
Luna B-MISC

' O
my O
mother O

, O
they O
responded O
: O
' O
Why O
would O
you O
do O
that O
alone O

That O
Khudojnazarov B-PER
is O
described O
here O

there O
as O
' O
the O
Kusturica B-PER

an O
indication O
to O
the O
audience O
of O
what O
kind O
of O
film O
experience O
they O
can O
expect O

but O
what O
does O
the O
director O
himself O
think O
about O
that O
? O

saturday O

To O
avoid O
a O
crash O
, O
the O
crew O
decided O
to O
throw O
the O
bull O
overboard O
. O

Because O
film O
is O
not O
about O
words O
, O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
literature O
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O

go O
, O
I O
am O
a O
very O
, O
very O
big O
fan O
of O
Federico B-PER
Fellini I-PER

also O
-- O
which O
may O
seem O
strange O

of O

then O
it O
happened O

that O
especially O
do O
not O
increase O
the O
budget O
for O
the O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O

a O

Then O
the O

guarantees O

say O

Radio B-ORG

has O
been O
thoroughly O
reformed O

although O
we O
have O
lost O
a O
few O

I O

the O

In O

we O
are O
following O
the O
possibilities O

This O
recognition O
is O
clearly O
coming O
from O
the O
world O
of O
( O
traditional O
) O
designers O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
prize O
and O
the O
exhibition O
. O

Evenepoel B-PER
, O
who O
devised O
the O
concept O
and O
compiled O
the O
book O
himself O
, O
is O
modest O
and O
sparse O
with O
information O
. O

It O
counts O
almost O
200 O
pages O
and O
is O
in O
the O
first O
place O
a O
look O
book O
, O
there O
is O
not O
much O
text O
. O

Just O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
stereotypical O
, O
bald O
- O
headed O
mannequins O
with O
size O
34 O
are O
not O
the O
most O
suitable O
models O
to O
wear O
Evenepoel B-MISC
's I-MISC
creations O
. O

Thus O
arose O
the O
first O
timid O
bracelets O
of O
rubber O
with O
a O
clasp O
of O
Plexiglas O
tubes O
. O

The O
accompanying O
retrospective O
exhibition O
gives O
a O
hint O
of O
what O
is O
to O
come O
. O

She O
buys O
a O
lot O

rubber O

stands O

Not O
really O
spectacular O
and O
still O
a O
bit O
stiff O
perhaps O
, O
but O
soon O
her O
designs O
take O
on O
much O
more O
volume O
and O
suggest O
a O
moving O
body O
. O

But O
what O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
70s O
was O
still O
a O
clumsy O
search O

results O
a O
few O
years O

there O
is O
also O

By O
then O
she O

The O

of O

never O

Barragán B-PER
at O

elaborating O
in O
his O

the O

according O
to O
Bac B-MISC

vision O

of O

all O

How O
great O
that O

The O
huge O

of O
the O
infertile O

unworkable O
soil O

Monasteries O

were O
the O
structures O
that O
left O
their O
clearest O

on O
him O

The O
fact O
that O
he O
has O
such O
a O
recognizable O
style O
is O
undoubtedly O
also O
the O
result O
of O
the O
large O
area O
that O
Barragán B-PER
could O
build O
on O
each O
time O

Because O
the O
houses O
were O
always O
a O
variation O
on O
the O
same O
theme O
, O
we O
can O
speak O
of O
a O
clear O
Barragán B-MISC
style I-MISC

Barragán B-PER
also O
took O
care O
of O
the O
surroundings O

noteworthy O
is O
the O
wide O
avenue O
he O
had O
built O

where O
he O

Reyes B-PER
was O
an O
artist O
and O
antique O
dealer O
, O
and O
he O
too O
imbued O
Barragán B-PER
with O
the O
importance O
of O
expressing O
the O
indigenous O
Mexican B-MISC
culture O
in O
his O
work O
. O

There O
is O
a O
reason O
why O
we O
did O
not O
yet O
know O
him O
well O

In O

died O
, O
and O
look O

now O
the O

to O
know O
all O
about O
him O

In O
the O
early O
1940s O
, O
when O
Barragán B-PER
was O
fully O
developing O
his O
own O
style O

he O
bought O

When O
he O
was O
back O
in O
Guadalajara O
after O
the O
Europe B-MISC

, O
he O
made O
friends O
with O
two O
architects O
: O
Rafael B-PER

Ignacio B-PER
Diaz I-PER

In O

Later O
the O
men O
met O

and O
Bac B-PER
would O
then O
have O
inspired O
and O
encouraged O
Barragán B-PER
to O
henceforth O
intertwine O
architecture O
and O
natural O
environment O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O

As O
the O
years O
progressed O

more O

more O

What O
makes O
the O
Mexican B-MISC

attractive O
for O
the O
flat O

is O
that O
very O
special O
mix O
of O

local O

the O
colors O
and O
the O

. O

That O
distinguishes O
his O
work O
for O
good O
from O
all O
other O
twentieth O

century O
architectural O
achievements O
. O

So O
social O
commitment O
is O
not O
to O
be O
sought O
in O
this O
architect O
. O

Bac B-PER
thought O
that O
gardens O
should O
be O
' O
magical O
places O
for O
meditation O
' O
, O
that O
they O
should O
have O
the O

. O

Like O
the O
Portuguese B-MISC
Alvaro B-PER
Siza I-PER

Luis B-PER
Barragán I-PER
also O
succeeded O
in O
creating O
a O
mixture O
of O
Mexican B-MISC
tradition O
and O
international O
modernist O

This O
began O
immediately O

author O

Not O
many O
details O
are O
known O
about O
his O
origins O
-- O
we O
do O
know O
that O
he O
came O
from O
an O
aristocratic O
family O
, O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
a O
farm O
near O
the O
village O
of O
Mazamitla B-LOC
in O
Michoacan B-LOC
, O
a O
region O
known O
for O
its O
unusual O
indigenous O
architecture O
. O

It O
also O
meant O
that O
all O
facets O
of O
daily O
life O
could O
be O
found O
in O
such O
a O
hacienda O
: O
birth O
, O
baptism O
and O
marriage O
, O
the O
fiestas O
and O
competitions O
, O
the O
bullfights O
and O
harvest O
festivals O
. O

In O
the O
early O
1940s O
Luis B-PER
Barragán I-PER
learned O
to O
look O
at O
his O
own O
country O
through O
those O
friendships O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
the O
house O
for O
the O
Engeström B-PER
family O
: O
on O
this O
large O
estate O
, O
the O
residential O
house O
is O
surpassed O
in O
beauty O
and O
poetic O
power O
by O
the O
part O
dedicated O
to O
the O
horses O
. O

Barragán B-PER
was O
able O
to O
indulge O
carefree O
in O
an O
intellectual O
, O
artistic O
existence O
full O
of O
formal O
poetry O
. O

Barragán B-PER
inherited O
from O
his O
hacienda O
not O
only O
his O
preference O
for O
space O
, O
and O
for O
typical O
Mexican B-MISC
elements O
, O
but O
also O
a O
love O
of O
horses O
. O

About O
the O
colors O
: O
to O
us O
they O
seem O
bright O
and O
bold O
, O
but O
on O
a O

you O
can O
actually O

Despite O
his O

, O
Luis B-PER
Barragán I-PER
also O
retained O
a O
certain O
sense O

at O

at O

point O

Remarkable O
about O
this O

is O
that O
he O
did O
not O
put O
the O

in O

central O
place O

but O
to O
the O
side O

so O
that O
the O
cross O
has O
to O
wait O

before O
it O
can O
throw O
its O
shadow O
in O

Barragán B-PER

to O
turn O
it O

a O
residential O
area O
for O

he O
built O

That O

has O
made O

the O
unusual O

he O
was O
: O
not O
brainwashed O
by O
an O

, O
he O
could O
let O

quite O
large O

usually O
require O
a O
little O

Many O
of O
these O

to O

around O

Pruning O
is O
not O
necessary O
, O
except O
to O
occasionally O
remove O
some O
dry O
or O
too O
thick O
branches O
. O

For O
such O
an O
application O
, O
it O
is O
best O
to O
choose O
roses O
that O
are O
not O
too O
strong O
and O
have O
supple O
branches O
that O
can O
easily O
be O
spiralled O
, O
such O
as O

The O
folding O
racks O
of O
thin O
wooden O
or O
plastic O
slats O
sold O
in O
garden O
centers O
, O
are O
worthless O
as O
a O
support O
rack O
for O
roses O
( O
and O
for O
most O
climbing O
plants O
) O
. O

Ideally O
, O
you O
should O
cut O
back O
the O
deadheads O
every O
year O
in O
autumn O
to O
a O
strong O
side O
shoot O
or O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
you O
should O
choose O
the O
roses O
according O
to O
the O
tree O
in O
which O
they O
are O
to O
grow O
. O

Buy O
simple O
models O
, O
without O
too O
many O
tirreleases O
that O
you O
will O
not O
see O
once O
they O
are O
completely O
covered O
by O
roses O
. O

Most O
climbing O
roses O
will O
be O
happier O
if O
they O
have O
more O
space O
than O
against O
a O
wall O
and O
the O
wind O
can O
get O
around O
them O
from O
all O
sides O
. O

A O
very O
attractive O
way O
to O
use O
climbing O
roses O
is O
to O
let O
them O
grow O
through O
an O
old O
( O
fruit O
) O
tree O
or O
a O
boring O
conifer O
. O

Such O
a O
rose O
support O
should O
be O
at O
least O
2.5 O
m O
high O
. O

This O
can O
be O
a O
pergola O
or O
a O
rose O
arch O
. O

Liana O
roses O
require O
little O
care O
, O
only O
need O
to O
be O
tethered O
almost O
permanently O
during O
the O
first O
few O
years O
. O

Because O
of O
their O
slightly O
more O
controlled O
growth O
and O
their O
longer O
blooms O
, O
they O
are O
more O
appropriate O
for O
most O
gardens O
than O
the O
vine O
roses O
. O

Because O
of O
their O
enormous O
vigor O
-- O
some O
varieties O
grow O
more O
than O
four O
feet O
per O
season O
-- O
they O
are O
less O
suitable O
for O
a O
small O
garden O
. O

A O
rose O
arch O
or O
a O
pergola O
should O
of O
course O
be O
sturdy O
enough O
to O
support O
the O
weight O
of O
climbing O
roses O
in O
rain O
and O
wind O
, O
but O
some O
structures O
look O
more O
like O
they O
could O
hang O
an O
elephant O
from O
it O

The O
annual O

is O
quite O
simple O
: O
regularly O
remove O
the O

if O
there O
are O
too O
many O
and O
remove O
old O
, O
dead O
and O
poorly O
flowering O
branches O

Between O
the O
stakes O
you O
let O
hang O
thick O
cords O
along O
which O
you O
lead O
the O
roses O
, O
so O
that O
you O
get O
a O
kind O
of O
rose O
garlands O

In O

this O
is O
usually O
not O

it O

about O

high O

By O
many O
enthusiasts O
, O
the O
somewhat O
stiffer O
' O
Madame B-MISC
Alfred I-MISC
Carrière I-MISC
' O
, O
introduced O
in O
1879 O
by O
the O
French B-MISC
rose O
grower O
Joseph B-PER
Schwartz I-PER
, O
is O
still O
considered O
the O
best O
white O
climber O
, O
very O
early O
and O
very O
long O
flowering O
. O

It O
is O
especially O
important O
to O
choose O
with O
an O
eye O
on O
where O
they O
should O
be O
placed O
( O
for O
a O
north O
facing O
wall O
for O
example O
only O
a O
few O
will O
qualify O
) O
and O
the O
support O
against O
which O
they O
should O
grow O
. O

In O
both O
cases O
you O
must O
ensure O
that O
they O
are O
tall O
and O
wide O
enough O
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
are O
often O
so O
ugly O
that O
instead O
of O
being O
an O
ornament O
to O
the O
garden O
they O
are O
rather O
a O
permanent O
source O
of O
annoyance O
. O

Afterwards O
the O
young O
branches O
will O
nestle O
between O
the O
old O
ones O
and O
largely O
take O
care O
of O
themselves O
. O

For O
such O
an O
application O
it O
is O
best O
to O
use O
a O
vine O
rose O
whose O
long O
pliable O
branches O
can O
easily O
be O
twisted O
around O
the O
cords O
. O

But O
during O
flowering O
the O
effect O
is O
overwhelming O
. O

Along O
a O
garden O
path O
you O
can O
drive O
low O
poles O
into O
the O
ground O
about O
a O
good O
meter O
high O
. O

You O
should O
always O
make O
sure O
that O
there O
is O
at O
least O
10 O
to O
15 O
cm O
( O
4 O
to O
6 O
inches O
) O
of O
space O
between O
the O
wall O
and O
the O
rose O
so O
that O
the O
wind O
can O
get O
behind O
it O
. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
do O
this O
, O
the O
rose O
will O
only O
grow O
in O
height O
and O
will O
only O
flower O
at O
the O
top O
, O
while O
at O
the O
bottom O
the O
bush O
will O
be O
completely O
bare O
. O

This O
can O
be O
difficult O
against O
a O
high O
wall O
or O
pergola O
or O
when O
placed O
between O
other O
plants O
. O

All O
climbing O
roses O
bloom O
best O
if O
their O
branches O
are O
guided O
as O
horizontally O
as O
possible O
or O
in O
arch O
form O
. O

I O
have O
in O
my O
garden O
for O
example O
two O
New B-MISC
Dawns I-MISC
, O
one O
against O
a O
wall O
facing O
south O
, O
the O
other O
just O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
supported O
( O
for O
now O
) O
with O
some O
bamboo O
sticks O
in O
a O
wedge O
shape O
. O

General O

Also O
some O
of O
the O
old O
Wichurianahybrids B-MISC
, O
such O
as O
' O
Albéric B-MISC
Barbier I-MISC
' O
and O
' O
Albertine B-MISC
' O
, O
have O
everything O
of O
a O
vine O
rose O
, O
but O
the O
flowers O
are O
bigger O
and O
they O
flower O
a O
second O
time O
in O
autumn O
. O

In O
most O
rose O
books O
and O
catalogs O
they O
make O
a O
distinction O
between O
climbing O
roses O
and O
vine O
roses O
. O

This O
prevents O
infestation O
by O
all O
kinds O
of O
fungi O
. O

So O
we O
must O
provide O
a O
support O
to O
which O
they O
are O
attached O
. O

Usually O
they O
do O
not O
grow O
much O
higher O
than O
1.5 O
to O
2 O
meters O
. O

The B-ORG

If O
you O
plant O
a O
climbing O
rose O
against O
a O
wall O
, O
put O
them O
as O
far O
away O
from O
the O
wall O
as O
possible O
( O
at O
least O
half O
a O
meter O
) O
and O
bend O
them O
to O
the O
wall O

Powerful O
climbers O
like O
' O
Bobbie B-MISC
James I-MISC
' O
or O
' O
Kiftsgate B-MISC
' O
for O
example O
, O
you O
can O
use O
them O
for O
tall O
trees O
( O
more O
than O
9 O
meters O
) O
, O
but O
not O
for O
an O
ordinary O
fruit O
tree O
. O

One O
of O
the O
next O
weeks O
I O
will O
try O
to O
give O
some O
tips O
in O
that O
regard O
. O

It O
is O
absurd O
to O
have O
a O
rose O
arch O
that O
is O
so O
low O
or O
narrow O
that O
you O
get O
snagged O
on O
the O
thorns O
when O
walking O
under O
it O
. O

The O
taller O
growing O
bourbon O
roses O
such O
as O
' O
Madame B-MISC
Isaac I-MISC
Pereire I-MISC
' O
, O
' O
Kathleen B-MISC
Harrop I-MISC
' O
or O
' O
Madame B-MISC
Ernest I-MISC
Calvat I-MISC
' O
can O
also O
be O
used O
perfectly O
as O
climbers O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
choose O
for O
example O
a O
lower O
- O
growing O
noisette O
such O
as O
' O
Madame B-MISC
Alfred I-MISC
Carrière I-MISC
' O
, O
' O
Desprez B-MISC
à I-MISC
Fleurs I-MISC
Jaunes I-MISC
' O
or O
' O
Francis B-MISC
E. I-MISC
Lester I-MISC
' O
, O
or O
the O
beautiful O
and O
strongly O
scented O
' O
Seagull B-MISC
' O
. O

Some O
are O
suitable O
for O
small O
spaces O
, O
others O
can O
cover O
a O
meter O
- O
high O
wall O
after O
a O
few O
years O
. O

Usually O
they O
have O
large O
clusters O
with O
many O
small O
flowers O
that O
bloom O
only O
once O
. O

They O
bloom O
namely O
on O
young O
wood O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
force O
them O
into O
a O
more O
formal O
straitjacket O
, O
they O
do O
need O
more O
pruning O
. O

page O

Unfortunately O
, O
many O
rose O
arches O
that O
are O
sold O
ready O
- O
made O
are O
often O
too O
narrow O
and/or O
too O
low O
. O

author O

A O
number O
of O
these O
vine O
roses O
can O
also O
be O
used O
as O
ground O
cover O
. O

The O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
some O
of O
them O
bloom O
only O
briefly O
, O
but O
many O
bloom O
all O
summer O
long O
, O
until O
the O
first O
frost O
. O

For O
most O
climbing O
roses O
, O
especially O
when O
placed O
against O
a O
wall O
, O
this O
is O
far O
from O
ideal O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
can O
only O
recommend O
that O
you O
go O
to O
rose O
gardens O
and O
rose O
growers O
to O
look O
at O
the O
roses O
in O
bloom O
and O
note O
which O
roses O
you O
like O
best O
and O
how O
they O
are O
used O
there O
. O

You O
can O
also O
build O
a O
free O
- O
standing O
rack O
with O
a O
few O
tall O
posts O
between O
which O
you O
stretch O
metal O
wires O
or O
add O
trellis O
work O
. O

Like O
all O
roses O
climbing O
roses O
prefer O
a O
sunny O
position O
. O

A O
rose O
arch O
or O
a O
pergola O
must O
of O
course O
be O
sturdy O
enough O
to O
bear O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
roses O
in O
rain O
and O
wind O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
these O
' O
tree O
roses O
' O
need O
a O
little O
help O
by O
tying O
them O
around O
the O
trunk O
of O
the O
tree O
, O
but O
once O
they O
reach O
the O
top O
they O
will O
find O
their O
own O
way O
. O

I O
like O
almost O
all O
of O
them O
. O

They O
also O
need O
to O
be O
tied O
very O
regularly O
. O

If O
your O
garden O
is O
suitable O
, O
then O
you O
should O
try O
to O
provide O
some O
kind O
of O
structure O
especially O
for O
your O
climbing O
roses O
. O

Best O
is O
therefore O
a O
wall O
on O
the O
east O
or O
west O
where O
they O
have O
at O
least O
about O
5 O
to O
6 O
hours O
of O
sun O
in O
the O
summer O
. O

No O
climbing O
rose O
can O
attach O
itself O
to O
a O
wall O
or O
something O
like O
for O
example O
ivy O
or O
wild O
vine O
. O

Not O
only O
are O
they O
difficult O
to O
attach O
at O
a O
sufficient O
distance O
from O
the O
wall O
, O
but O
in O
addition O
the O
slats O
break O
after O
a O
few O
years O
under O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
roses O
. O

What O
we O
call O
climbing O
roses O
, O
are O
simply O
shrub O
roses O
that O
create O
long O
shoots O
and O
work O
their O
way O
up O
along O
all O
possible O
supports O
-- O
trees O
, O
walls O
, O
arches O
, O
poles O
. O

If O
the O
rose O
can O
hang O
over O
the O
roof O
, O
the O
gazebo O
turns O
into O
one O
blooming O
rose O
in O
early O
summer O
. O

One O
from O

who O
thought O
me O
very O
stupid O
for O
not O
knowing O
what O
butterfish O
was O
-- O
it O
was O
in O
fillets O
at O
his O
fishmonger O
's O
, O
he O
ate O
it O
regularly O
and O
it O
was O
very O
tasty O
. O

Or O
another O
thing O
: O
butterfish O
. O

If O
you O
stopped O
cooking O
too O
soon O
, O
the O
flour O
did O
n't O
cook O
and O
the O
" O
balkenbrij O
" O
became O
limp O
. O

That O
could O
never O
have O
been O
the O
fillet O
he O
had O
on O
his O

There O
are O
about O
fourteen O
in O

now O
and O
certainly O
some O
of O
them O
are O
on O

that O
I O
ca O

say O
for O

do O
more O
surely O

that O
's O
the O
way O
life O
seems O
to O
be O

I O
would O
rather O
bite O
my O
tongue O

deceive O
you O

They O
just O
do O

get O
to O

it O

There O
are O
other O
names O

such O
as O
karboet O

curiously O
it O
also O

it O

usually O
made O

all O

you O

you O

the O

the O

either O

Sometimes O
sweets O
such O
as O

added O

a O
predominantly O
Gelderse B-MISC
custom O

whereby O
the O

If O
there O
were O
sufficiently O
large O
pieces O

bacon O
in O

they O

But O
technology O
does O
not O
stand O
still O

None O
of O
the O
above O
mentioned O
fish O
is O
a O
regular O
butterfish O
, O
but O
because O
the O
importers O
of O
exotic O

seem O
to O
have O
something O
else O
to O
do O
than O
to O
put O

they O
translate O
the O

under O
which O
it O

them O

thus O
end O
up O
with O
butterfish O

a O
name O
that O
in O
our O

is O
already O
occupied O

another O

the O

Butterfish O
it O
was O
not O

but O
perhaps O
one O
of O
the O
many O
fish O
called O
butterfish O
by O
English B-MISC
speakers I-MISC

a O

almost O
never O

However O
much O

do O
their O
best O
to O

to O
the O
native O
society O

so O
goes O
the O

will O
always O

Immediately O
a O

the O

that O
Leman B-PER

How O

Racist O
, O
xenophobic O

these O
are O
words O
that O
are O
often O
heard O
when O
the O
program O
of O
the O
Vlaams B-ORG
Blok I-ORG
is O
discussed O

" O

spin O
on O
the O
often O
evoked O
contradiction O
between O
unconditional O

cocooning O
in O

The O
parallel O
does O
not O
end O
there O
; O
just O
like O
in O
Lier B-LOC

Pricma B-ORG
also O
stood O
at O
the O
cradle O
of O
the O
fledgling O
self O

organization O
in O
Boom B-LOC

There O
is O
no O
discussion O
about O
priority O

one O
at O
Chebbab B-ORG
: O
the O
self O
- O
organisation O
wants O
to O
move O
into O
its O
own O
Moroccan B-MISC
youth O
centre O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O

No O
sooner O
said O

done O
, O
Nour B-ORG
has O
found O
a O
listening O
ear O
with O
the O
Boom B-MISC
police O

It O
was O
mainly O
young O
Moroccan B-MISC
men O
who O
had O
spoken O
out O

The O
pioneering O
days O
of O
Paula B-PER

are O
long O
over O
, O
and O

for O

is O
now O
regulated O
by O
decree O
. O

Accusing O
the O
target O
group O
of O
apathy O
, O
that O
's O
what O
usually O
happens O
. O

Apparently O
the O
Chebbab B-MISC
spokespersons I-MISC
made O
an O
impression O
. O

If O
young O
people O
become O
aware O
of O
their O
traditions O
, O
they O
will O
feel O
better O
about O
themselves O
. O

" O
But O
above O
all O
do O
not O
dismiss O
it O
as O
the O
frustrations O
of O
a O
few O
isolated O
hotheads O
. O

No O
, O
you O
could O
not O
really O
call O
serene O
the O
recent O
debate O
on O
migrants O
and O
integration O
in O
this O
newspaper O
. O

Careful O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
throwing O
a O
rock O
at O
the O
Chiro B-ORG
or O
the O
Scouts O
. O

No O
more O
paternalism O
, O
that O
's O
the O
philosophy O
of O
the O
new O
decree O
. O

Fifteen O
years O
ago O
, O
it O
was O
constantly O
stressed O
that O
migrants O
must O
learn O
Dutch B-MISC
to O
integrate O
. O

Political O
debates O

, O

from O
the O

are O

" O
The O
local O
support O
center O
is O
our O
ally O
" O
, O
says O
Ali B-PER
Salhi I-PER
. O

At O
Nour B-ORG
they O
can O
confirm O
this O
word O
for O
word O
, O
although O
the O
roots O
of O
these O
young O
people O
are O
not O
in O
Lier B-LOC
but O
in O
Boom B-LOC
. O

What O
can O
we O
do O
about O
it O
? O

" O
A O
place O
of O
our O
own O
is O
necessary O
, O
" O
says O
Ali B-PER
, O
" O
because O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
Flemish B-MISC
youth O
movements O
is O
far O
too O
high O
. O

That O
is O
not O
cocooning O
, O
it O
is O
precisely O
the O
intention O
of O
Chebbab B-ORG
to O
bring O
them O
into O
contact O
with O
the O
autochthonous O
society O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O

, O
the O
director O
of O
the O
Centre B-ORG
for I-ORG
Equal I-ORG

and I-ORG
Opposition O
to O
Racism O
, O
did O
not O
leave O
it O
at O
that O
and O
took O
up O
the O
cause O
himself O
. O

So O
we O
set O
up O
a O
contact O
group O
so O
that O
the O
town O
council O
and O
the O
mosque O
association O
could O
consult O
. O

And O
indeed O
, O
just O
like O
their O
colleagues O
from O
Chebbab B-ORG
, O
these O
articulate O
Moroccans B-MISC
are O
also O
liberated O
by O
local O
politicians O
. O

So O
much O
for O
the O
theory O
. O

But O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
, O
sooner O
or O
later O
you O
will O
run O
into O
us O
in O
politics O

whose O
scope O
is O
far O
from O

the O

the O
eyes O
of O
the O
Flemings B-MISC
you O
remain O
a O
migrant O
, O
a O
Moroccan B-MISC
, O
an O
Islamist O
, O
an O
outsider O
. O

I O
said O
it O
already O
, O
as O
a O
student O
I O
was O
in O
all O
possible O
associations O
. O

As O
in O
any O
broken O
marriage O
, O
the O
sharpest O
words O
were O
reserved O
for O
the O
former O
partner O
, O
in O
this O
case O
the O
so O
- O
called O
migrant O
sector O
. O

We O
are O
now O
in O
early O
June O
, O
many O
schools O
have O
already O
unofficially O
started O
to O
recruit O
students O
. O

In O
turn O
, O
these O
eight O
centers O
branch O
off O
into O
a O
series O
of O
local O
support O
centers O
, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Pricma B-ORG
are O
Mechelen B-LOC
, O
Boom B-LOC
, O
Lier B-LOC
, O
Turnhout B-LOC
, O
Willebroek B-LOC
, O
Bornem B-LOC
and O
Mol B-LOC
. O

Such O
an O
approach O
obviously O
takes O
more O
effort O
, O
for O
that O
you O
really O
have O
to O
stand O
among O
the O
immigrants O
. O
" O

According O
to O
him O
the O
integration O
centers O
fail O
to O
reach O
their O
target O
group O
, O
not O
least O
because O
the O
immigrants O
themselves O
have O
far O
too O
little O
say O
in O
the O
policy O
of O
those O
centers O
. O

The O
explanation O
for O
segregation O
already O
sounds O
familiar O
to O
me O
. O

Chebbab B-ORG

go O

Nour B-ORG

on O
good O
terms O
with O

both O

Flemings O
on O

road O
, O
there O
is O
smooth O
cooperation O
with O
indigenous O

" O
The O
practice O
is O
less O
beautiful O
" O
, O
Younes B-PER
knows O
from O
experience O
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
you O
get O
paranoia O
from O
it O
. O

" O
The O
new O
decree O
contains O
good O
approaches O
, O
but O
we O
are O
still O
far O
from O
it O
. O

He O
has O
no O
lack O
of O
fresh O
food O
for O
his O
scepticism O
, O
the O
education O
sector O
is O
a O
guarantee O
for O
that O
. O

Although O
the O
decree O
was O
precisely O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
hopeless O
fragmentation O
within O
the O
migrant O
sector O
, O
the O
new O
structure O
also O
looks O
quite O
complex O
. O

It O
is O
ridiculous O
that O
they O
are O
still O
beating O
around O
the O
ears O
the O
second O
generation O
with O
concepts O
such O
as O
integration O
and O
assimilation O
. O

It O
is O
a O
cold O
shower O
every O
time O
the O
Vlaams B-ORG
Blok I-ORG
makes O
a O
leap O
forward O
. O

Strengthening O
one O
's O
own O
community O
as O
a O
means O
of O
emancipation O
, O
that O
is O
the O
philosophy O
. O

Personal O
attacks O
were O
not O
shunned O
in O
the O
procession O
of O
free O
stands O
and O
reader O
letters O
. O

" O
Thirty O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
the O
first O
generation O
settled O
here O
, O
then O
they O
should O
have O
worked O
on O
integration O
. O

The O
idea O
is O
that O
these O
integration O
centers O
will O
help O
authorities O
such O
as O
municipalities O
, O
public O
welfare O
centres O
, O
schools O
, O
housing O
and O
employment O
services O
to O
develop O
a O
minorities O
policy O
and O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
target O
groups O
are O
involved O
in O
this O
policy O
. O

It O
is O
the O
dark O
skin O
color O
that O
makes O
the O
difference O
. O

The O
migrant O
debate O
in O
May O
on O
the O
opinion O
pages O
of O
De B-ORG
Morgen I-ORG
did O
not O
shy O
away O
from O
strong O
statements O
. O

Now O
that O
the O
dust O
has O
settled O
a O
bit O
, O
we O
went O
out O
on O
the O
field O
to O
take O
the O
temperature O
. O

Many O
also O
think O
it O
too O
expensive O
, O
immigrant O
families O
usually O
do O
not O
have O
much O
money O
. O

We O
have O
since O
cleared O
up O
that O
misunderstanding O
. O

But O
that O
was O
not O
the O
target O
of O
this O
tirade O
. O

Then O
you O
start O
to O
doubt O
whether O
that O
friendly O
smile O
of O
your O
neighbor O
is O
sincere O
. O

Migrants O
are O
hardly O
organized O
here O
, O
we O
ourselves O
urge O
them O
to O
unite O

Zitouni B-PER

What O
is O
their O
position O
towards O
the O

sector O
, O
and O
what O
is O
its O
position O
towards O
them O
? O

I O
have O
my O
reservations O
about O
that O
. O

There O
is O
no O
shortage O
of O
customers O
, O
provincial O
towns O
like O
Mechelen B-LOC
, O
Lier B-LOC
and O
Boom B-LOC
have O
substantial O
Moroccan B-MISC
and O
Turkish B-MISC
communities O
. O

Only O
they O
do O
n't O
get O
the O
chance O
because O
the O
courses O
on O
offer O
are O
woefully O
inadequate O
, O
resulting O
in O
endless O
waiting O
lists O
. O

Here O
in O
the O
province O
, O
there O
is O
no O
question O
of O
rivalry O
. O

Today O
I O
still O
hear O
exactly O
the O
same O
complaint O
. O

Who O
do O
we O
turn O
to O
for O
subsidies O
? O

What O
is O
actually O
going O
on O
? O

And O
then O
I O
go O
back O
to O
my O
own O
city O
and O
there O
's O
this O
huge O
gap O
between O
Belgians B-MISC
and O
Moroccans B-MISC
. O
" O

First O
we O
have O
to O
organize O
the O
young O
people O
within O
the O
community O
itself O
. O

The O
personnel O
policy O
has O
also O
evolved O
considerably O
. O

The O
tea O

and O
other O

are O
also O
over O
, O
integration O
centers O

now O
focus O

Take O
the O
dance O

, O
there O
is O
also O
hardly O
any O
progress O
to O
be O
seen O
. O
" O

Several O
participants O
wiped O
the O
floor O
with O
immigrant O
politicians O
à O
la O
Fauzaya B-PER
Talhaoui I-PER
and O
Nahima B-PER
Lanjri I-PER

That O
's O
working O
out O
quite O
well O
, O
in O
Lier B-LOC
and O
Boom B-LOC
young O
Moroccans B-MISC
have O
now O
set O
up O
a O
self O
- O
organization O
. O

" O
Look O
, O
it O
is O
not O
because O
I O
step O
into O
politics O
, O
that O
I O
forget O
my O
roots O
. O

The O
wounded O
pride O
of O
young O
immigrants O

With O
these O
and O
other O
questions O
I O
went O
to O
Boom B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Integration I-ORG
Center I-ORG
Antwerp I-ORG
is O
located O
. O

We O
agreed O
to O
meet O
in O
the O
Good B-LOC
Example I-LOC
, O
a O
brown O
youth O
pub O
under O
the O
towers O
of O
the O
town O
hall O
. O

We O
play O
a O
purely O
advisory O
role O
, O
we O
do O
not O
interfere O
with O
the O
content O
. O

When O
the O
city O
organized O
a O
youth O
week O
, O
Moroccan B-MISC
and O
Turkish B-MISC
youngsters O
were O
left O
out O
in O
the O
cold O
. O

Our O
interest O
in O
Islam O
fits O
perfectly O
into O
that O
picture O
. O

We O
have O
made O
the O
contacts O
and O
discussed O
the O
locations O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
migrants O
themselves O
who O
put O
politicians O
to O
the O
test O
. O
" O

That O
did O
n't O
happen O
, O
and O
now O
the O
second O
generation O
is O
left O
with O
the O
mess O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
, O
Nourdine B-PER
El I-PER
Kaouakibi I-PER
, O
Mohamed B-PER
El I-PER
Ghamri I-PER
, O
Abdelhafid B-PER
El I-PER
Ajoutti I-PER
sacrificed O
an O
hour O
of O
their O
precious O
block O
time O
for O
me O
. O

Because O
we O
should O
not O
be O
blinded O
by O
the O
rabble O
of O
intellectuals O
with O
university O
degrees O
that O
are O
now O
making O
headlines O
in O
politics O
and O
the O
media O
. O

So O
where O
do O
the O
complaints O
come O
from O
about O
the O
insufficient O
participation O
of O
immigrants O
? O

Another O
thing O
: O
the O
past O
few O
months O
we O
have O
organized O
debates O
between O
immigrants O
and O
politicians O
just O
about O
everywhere O
. O

Or O
maybe O
boys O
and O
girls O
go O
to O
camp O
together O
. O

I O
myself O
refused O
an O
elective O
seat O
. O

It O
's O
still O
very O
early O
, O
but O
I O
already O
have O
a O
list O
of O
immigrant O
youth O
who O
ca O
n't O
register O
. O
" O

The O
fourth O
delegate O
, O
Zitouni B-PER
Berraki I-PER
, O
is O
a O
graduate O
and O
works O
as O
a O
technical O
clerk O
in O
a O
refinery O
. O

Do O
we O
make O
it O
an O
actual O
association O
or O
a O
non O
- O
profit O
organization O
? O

Not O
that O
he O
wants O
to O
contradict O
the O
findings O
of O
Chebbab B-ORG
or O
Nour B-ORG
. O

Then O
I O
wonder O
: O
have O
they O
learned O
nothing O
in O
those O
fifteen O
years O
? O

" O
We O
started O
last O
year O
, O
" O
says O
Ali B-PER
. O

Suppose O
, O
you O
call O
a O
parent O
meeting O
and O
no O
chicken O
shows O
up O
. O

Ali B-PER
Salhi I-PER
from O
Chebbab B-ORG
: O
' O
First O
we O
have O
to O
organize O
the O
young O
people O
within O
the O
community O
itself O
. O

If O
six O
Moroccans B-MISC
show O
up O
on O
the O
doorstep O
to O
talk O
, O
they O
're O
talking O
about O
a O
youth O
gang O
. O

Not O
a O
random O
choice O
. O

At O
Chebbab B-ORG
in O
Lier B-LOC
, O
they O
are O
already O
excited O
about O
Pricma B-ORG
's O
role O
. O

The O
Moroccan B-MISC
community O
itself O
is O
asking O
for O
resolute O
police O
action O
. O
" O

For O
each O
support O
point O
there O
is O
a O
steering O
committee O
in O
which O
immigrants O
occupy O
one O
third O
of O
the O
seats O
. O

Thus O
the O
acronym O
EAB B-MISC
, O
Eternal B-MISC
Other I-MISC
Citizen I-MISC
, O
was O
introduced O
. O

Islamic B-MISC
schools O
, O
immigrant O
self O

organizations O
, O
rediscovering O
the O
roots O
, O
all O
salvation O
must O
be O
sought O
within O
the O
own O
community O
. O

Excuse B-MISC
- I-MISC
Truises I-MISC
who O
allow O
themselves O
to O
be O
used O
by O
parties O
who O
are O
itching O
for O
the O
growing O
number O
of O
migrant O
votes O
. O

But O
you O
can O
also O
look O
elsewhere O
for O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
flop O
. O

Then O
you O
can O
adopt O
two O
attitudes O
. O

But O
does O
the O
model O
work O
in O
practice O
? O

Unfortunately O
, O
Younes B-PER
El I-PER
Yousfi I-PER
must O
immediately O
put O
a O
damper O
on O
it O
. O

What O
is O
wrong O
with O
that O
? O

Mouthful O
elements O
of O
the O
second O
generation O
, O
the O
academic O
titles O
were O
like O
letters O
of O
adeliction O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
page O

Yes O
, O
Younes B-PER
also O
followed O
the O

The O
happening O
during O

The O

do O
we O
approach O
official O
bodies O
? O

It O
is O
not O
because O
we O
appoint O
a O
Turk B-MISC
or O
Moroccan B-MISC
as O
director O
of O
the O
VMC B-ORG
tomorrow O
that O
all O
emancipation O
problems O
are O
immediately O
off O
the O
table O
. O
" O

In O
my O
eyes O
it O
was O
an O
absurd O
situation O
. O

Do O
they O
read O
in O
the O
newspaper O
that O
one O
Moroccan B-MISC
committed O
a O
theft O
, O
then O
suddenly O
all O
Moroccans B-MISC
are O
thieves O
. O

Yet O
I O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
this O
debate O
is O
especially O
alive O
in O
the O
big O
cities O
. O

By O
way O
of O
an O
aperitif O
, O
I O
was O
treated O
to O
a O
dry O
but O
necessary O
introduction O
. O

A O
few O
went O
a O
step O
further O
and O
preached O
Arab B-MISC
pride I-MISC
as O
a O
path O
to O
emancipation O
. O

It O
is O
no O
coincidence O
that O
they O
are O
mainly O
against O
Johan B-PER
Leman I-PER
. O

Turned O
out O
that O
the O
agents O
were O
afraid O
that O
their O
intervention O
would O
cause O
riots O
. O

The O
whole O
concept O
of O
integration O
is O
racist O
, O
xenophobic O
and O
degrading O
, O
fulminated O
one O
polemicist O
somewhat O
pleonastic O
. O

A O
whole O
generation O
is O
in O
danger O
of O
being O
lost O
. O

We O
both O
made O
the O
same O
observation O
: O
there O
were O
no O
facilities O
at O
all O
in O
Lier B-LOC
for O
immigrant O
youngsters O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
politicians O
are O
talking O
about O
integration O
, O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
they O
want O
to O
make O
up O
for O
thirty O
years O
of O
lagging O
behind O
in O
one O
fell O
swoop O
. O

Younes B-PER

government O
's O
long O
- O
standing O
refusal O
to O
recognize O
the O
ecclesiastical O
authority O

Tang B-PER
has O
his O
reservations O
about O
the O
way O
Mr. O

presents O
things O
. O

The O
interpreter O
translates O
: O
it O

the O

Once O
he O
was O
taught O
by O
Father O
Bruns B-PER

In O
Changli B-LOC
, O
however O
, O
Father O
Bruns B-PER
had O
done O
his O
work O
thoroughly O
. O

In O
the O
Chinese B-MISC
countryside O
of O
the O
1940s O
, O
solid O
education O
was O
as O
sensational O
a O
phenomenon O
as O
the O
Gospel O
. O

Immediately O
all O
foreigners O
were O
declared O
an O
undesirable O
element O
. O

After O
the O
' O
great O

' O
had O
been O
removed O
from O
the O
field O
, O
the O

was O

with O

. O

The O
image O
of O
the O
young O
Dutchman B-MISC
looking O
sternly O
into O
the O
lens O
elicits O
an O
immediate O
reaction O
from O
an O
old O
Chinese B-MISC
man I-MISC
. O

The O

more O

less O
sent O

So O
Father O

prefers O
not O

" O
I O

the O

Father O

He O

his O

remember O
how O
amazed O
they O
were O
by O
the O
tall O
man O
in O
his O
black O
pipe O
who O
set O
up O
schools O
and O
told O
about O

But O
after O

was O
already O
flat O

A O
certain O
Father O

captured O

In O
1977 O
, O
after O
Mao B-PER

death O
, O
things O
began O
to O
change O

There O
was O
only O
one O
thing O
to O
do O
: O
to O
go O
and O
investigate O
in O
China B-LOC

Could O
n't O
the O
horrible O
truth O
be O
stated O
in O

Countless O

Those O

never O

Had O
the O

anything O

But O
danger O
still O
lurked O
elsewhere O

Nor O
was O
it O
clear O
how O
the O
events O
had O
been O
understood O
by O
the O
Chinese B-MISC

His O

As O
a O
result O
, O
there O
are O
two O
Catholic O
movements O

a O

one O

an O
underground O
one O

which O
adhered O

suppressed O

Did O
anyone O
know O
where O
it O

The O

It O
had O
even O
been O
a O
big O
question O

whether O
anyone O
in O

remembered O
it O
. O

The O
church O
dates O
from O
1937 O
and O
was O
built O
by O
Dutch B-MISC
missionaries O
who O
had O
chosen O
Xianfeng B-LOC
as O
a O
base O
for O
the O
Christianization O
of O
the O
surrounding O
countryside O

Because O
about O
one O
thing O
Mr. O
Li B-PER
wants O
to O
make O
no O
mistake O
: O
in O
China B-LOC
everyone O
is O
free O
to O
practice O
the O
religion O

The O
Tangs B-PER
have O
gone O
all O
out O

the O
Father O

a O
real O

A O

exceptional O

In O
the O
village O
itself O
, O
such O
means O
of O
transport O
were O
not O
counted O
on O
at O
all O

Therefore O
, O
Monsignor B-PER
sent O
me O
out O
and O
let O
it O
be O
known O
to O
the O
Christians O
, O
that O
for O
ministry O
they O
should O
go O
to O
me O

that O

They O
make O
it O
difficult O
for O
themselves O
and O
everyone O
else O
" O
, O
says O
Father O
Tang B-PER
. O

But O
something O
kept O
gnawing O
. O

The O
Father O
preferred O
to O
banish O
the O
past O
to O
a O
remote O
corner O
of O
his O
consciousness O
, O
as O
almost O
all O
Chinese B-MISC
do O
with O
the O
lesser O
things O
of O
their O
history O

The O
suspension O
of O
the O
car O
is O
severely O
tested O

but O
the O
driver O
manages O
to O
reach O
the O
village O

In O
the O
afternoon O

Mr. O
Li B-PER
comes O
to O
visit O
us O
at O
our O
hotel O

He O
puts O
on O
his O
superplie O

starts O
reciting O
Latin B-MISC

There O
he O
had O
to O
openly O
confess O
all O
he O
had O
done O
in O
the O
past O

The O

were O

even O
if O

His O
attitude O
is O
understandable O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
government O
is O
so O
sympathetic O
to O
religious O
developments O
that O
Changli B-LOC
has O
been O
declared O
one O
of O
the O
three O
most O

the O
People B-LOC

The O
Christians O
are O
very O

very O
poor O

On O
that O
point O
a O

" O

Subject O
of O

religious O
freedom O
in O

Well O
, O
you O
can O
be O
Catholic O
in O
China B-LOC
today O
, O
but O
under O
government O
control O
. O

Only O
after O
the O
atomic O
bombs O
on O
Hiroshima B-LOC
and O
Nagasaki B-LOC
the O
Japanese B-MISC
withdrew O
from O
China B-LOC
. O

Next O
to O
it O
is O
a O
small O
, O
cavernous O
space O
. O

And O
that O
is O
why O
a O
new O
church O
is O
now O
being O
built O
in O
Changli B-LOC

We O
are O
not O
dealing O
here O
with O
a O
more O
or O
less O
random O
incident O
, O
but O
with O
a O
systematic O
fight O
against O
religion O
. O

The O
priest O
prayed O
aloud O
in O
Chinese B-MISC
: O
" O
God B-PER
, O
take O
my O
soul O
to O
You O
soon O
! O
" O

Six O
years O
later O
the O
government O
set O
up O
its O
own O
version O
of O
the O
Catholic O
Church O
, O
the O
Chinese B-ORG
Patriotic I-ORG
Church I-ORG
, O
condemning O
the O
Pope O
as O
a O
foreign O
and O
therefore O
unconstitutional O
authority O
and O
recognizing O
the O
Communist O
Party O
as O
the O
supreme O
body O
. O

Some O
were O
immediately O
executed O
, O
others O
, O
including O
Leo B-PER
Bruns I-PER
, O
were O
housed O
in O
a O
prison O
camp O
. O

Such O
a O
church O
in O
Changli B-LOC
also O
benefits O
the O
development O
of O
the O
region O
, O
underlines O
Mr. O
Li B-PER
, O
because O
its O
construction O
involved O
no O
less O
than O
52 O
enterprises O
. O

Then O
they O
stabbed O
him O
with O
the O
bayonet O
, O
ripped O
out O
his O
heart O
and O
cut O
off O
his O
head O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
family O
learned O
to O
live O
with O
the O
facts O
. O

According O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
Sisters B-ORG
, O
then O
began O
the O
execution O
of O
six O
other O
convicts O
, O
who O
were O
clubbed O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

He O
became O
a O
parish O

in O
Changli B-LOC
, O
a O
village O
not O
far O
from O
Xianfeng B-LOC

Just O
late O
last O
year O
dozens O
of O
priests O
and O
believers O
were O
arrested O
. O

Leo B-PER
Bruns I-PER
returned O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Changli B-LOC

where O
he O
was O
greeted O
by O
the O
parishioners O
in O
good O
spirits O
. O

And O
they O
beat O
on O

On O
October O
20 O

1947 O

the O

brought O
victory O
to O
Pengshui B-LOC

a O

descended O

said O

a O

to O

all O

an O
ancient O

There O
he O
got O
his O

so O
he O
had O

he O

tried O

The O

the O

From O
Venice B-LOC
Jacopo B-PER
de I-PER
' O
Barbari O
came O
to O
Mechelen B-LOC
, O
to O
become O
the O
court O
painter O
of O
Margaret B-PER
of O
Austria B-LOC
-- O
Albrecht B-PER
Dürer I-PER
tried O
in O
1521 O
to O
buy O
the O
sketchbook O
of O
the O
deceased O
artist O
from O
the O
governess O
, O
but O
got O
the O
lid O
on O
the O
nose O
. O

Immediately O
I O
learned O
that O
a O
foreign O
guest O
lecturer O
with O
an O
exotic O
specialty O
was O
as O
stimulating O
as O
a O
foreign O
, O
exotic O
painting O
worked O
for O
my O
favorite O
artists O
. O

Such O
regionalist O
views O
have O
long O
created O
blind O
spots O
in O
art O
historical O
knowledge O
. O

Professors O
mainly O
teach O
about O
their O
specialties O
, O
these O
are O
their O
hobbies O
-- O
and O
if O
no O
professor O
on O
the O
faculty O
has O
the O
same O
hobby O
as O
you O
, O
you O
are O
on O
your O
own O

-DOCSTART- O
Just O
as O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
to O
ever O
have O
to O
be O
a O
restaurant O
. O

That O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
mostly O
farms O
that O
needed O
new O
masonry O
and O
such O
and O
we O
did O
n't O
see O
that O
as O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

And O
even O
with O
the O
most O
powerful O
satellite O
dish O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
can O
catch O
a O
Dutch B-MISC
language I-MISC
channel O
. O

Is O
there O
an O
urgent O
need O
to O
invest O
in O
the O
youth O
, O
like O
in O
Belgian B-MISC
soccer O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
have O
much O
theater O
to O
offer O
. O

There O
we O
can O
already O
receive O
guests O
, O
but O
there O
are O
still O
works O
in O
progress O
on O
the O
upper O
floor O
. O

I O
have O
been O
listening O
to O
Jan B-PER
Wauters I-PER
for O
a O
while O
to O
hear O
how O
the O
Belgians B-MISC
did O
against O
Turkey B-LOC

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
what O
you O
can O
receive O
on O
cable O
-- O
except O
for O
Arte B-ORG
-- O
is O
absolute O
shit O
. O

That O
gets O
frustrating O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
you O
get O
the O
feeling O
you O
're O
wasting O
your O
time O
. O

' O
I O
sit O
there O
and O
I O
think O
: O
say O
yes O
to O
life O
, O
of O
your O
amen O
and O
your O
glory O
, O
yoochee O
! O
' O

" O
Gosh O
, O
that O
's O
a O
tough O
one O
. O

But O
oh O
well O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
'll O
really O
miss O
, O
is O
the O
newsreel O
. O

I O
myself O
have O
become O
neither O
, O
precisely O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
imagination O
" O

But O
in O
France B-LOC
, O
a O
satellite O
dish O
would O
have O
to O
be O
installed O
, O
for O
the O
simple O
reason O
that O
outside O
of O
Paris B-LOC
, O
there O
is O
virtually O
nothing O
wired O
. O

Not O
to O
make O
things O
too O
difficult O
: O
the O
reviews O
all O
appeared O
in O
this O
newspaper O
in O
' O
92 O
and O
' O
93 O
. O

Did O
you O
have O
television O
here O
? O

Périgueux B-LOC
, O
bergerac B-LOC
... O

So O
. O

I O
could O
swear O
when O
it O
suited O
me O
, O
and O
this O
is O
because O
the O
use O
of O
those O
texts O
was O
exclusively O
for O
inside O
rooms O
, O
more O
specifically O
for O
the O
dramatists O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
take O

a O
possible O

something O

" O

Who O
knows O
, O
you O
may O
get O
mainly O
directors O

actors O
coming O
over O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
ins O

outs O
of O
the O
Flemish B-MISC

It O
came O
down O

I O
could O
put O
in O
there O
things O
for O
better O

worse O
that O
went O
far O

During O

most O
of O
the O

n't O
feel O
like O
going O
to O

in O
the O
evening O
and O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
eat O
what O
we O
prepare O
for O

then O
they O
can O

I O
'll O
say O

( O

For O
the O
past O
five O
, O
twenty O
- O
six O
years O
I O
have O
been O
in O
nothing O
but O
the O
theater O
: O
first O
as O
a O
reviewer O
, O
then O
as O
a O
dramaturg O

for O
the O
past O
three O
years O
as O

for O

With O
all O
the O
mess O
and O
rumble O
and O
bad O
comedy O
acting O
, O
even O
the O
feeling O
arises O
that O
it O
's O
all O
far O
too O
neat O
and O
too O
well O
done O
for O
this O
play O
, O
that O
the O
performance O
does O
n't O
achieve O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
text O

( O
pondering O
) O
" O
It O
's O
a O
monologue O
, O
so O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
rent O
laws O
, O
we O
could O
stay O
here O
for O
three O
more O
years O
, O
but O
then O
suddenly O
it O
would O
have O
to O
be O
for O
nine O
years O
. O

Indeed O
it O
is O
. O

People O
with O
whom O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
if O
you O
see O
them O
often O
or O
not O
, O
with O
whom O
you O
had O
a O
conversation O
yesterday O
that O
you O
can O
continue O
six O
months O
later O
. O

" O
There O
are O
already O
people O
who O
have O
called O
, O
but O
we O
are O
holding O
off O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

" O
Mmm O
. O

I O
would O
tilt O
with O
several O
orders O
. O

" O
They O
'll O
never O
see O
me O
there O
. O

Those O
take O
place O
there O
summer O
and O
winter O
, O
in O
all O
kinds O
of O
churches O
. O

But O
at O
least O
it O
's O
trying O
. O

Three O
good O
actors O
versus O
no O
director O
worth O
having O
, O
or O
I O
should O
be O
terribly O
mistaken O
here O
. O

The O
correct O
answer O
is O
: O
Willy B-PER
Thomas I-PER
in O
... O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
it O
's O
enough O
. O

You O
see O
it O
in O
soccer O
too O
: O
that O
' O
yes O
but O
we O
did O
our O
best O
... O
' O
mentality O
. O
' O

Or O
is O
it O
the O
people O
who O
were O
not O
accepted O
for O
an O
acting O
training O
who O
then O
try O
to O
follow O
a O
directing O
school O
? O

" O
Here O
it O
is O
, O
yes O
. O

" O
That O
decision O
was O
made O
when O
we O
had O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
vacation O
home O
for O
a O
while O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
second O
home O

I O
'm O
talking O
about O
the O
drama O
school O
exam O
projects O
. O

Those O
are O
the O
first O
things O
I O
think O
of O
. O
" O

That O
means O
the O
soundproofing O
is O
virtually O
non O
- O
existent O
. O

We O
then O
decided O
pretty O
quickly O
that O
I O
would O
apply O
for O
my O
pension O
early O
and O
we O
would O
just O
live O
in O

The B-LOC
Toneelhuis I-LOC
was O
also O
hardly O
interested O
in O
a O

it O
was O
more O
about O

, O
actors O

For O
the O
rest O
we O
actually O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
each O
other O

There O
must O
be O
some O
kind O
of O
understanding O
where O
you O
can O
leave O
each O
other O
alone O

" O
I O
was O
also O
pleased O
because O
I O
saw O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
that O
I O
used O
to O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
going O
to O
see O

because O
there O
was O

enough O
time O

because O
I O
did O

it O
was O
appropriate O

No O
, O
I O
do O

know O

While O
it O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
professionalism O

Originally O
we O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
that O
in O
Roussillon B-LOC

west O
of O
the O
Narbonne B-LOC
, O
or O
at O
least O
in O
that O
region O
. O

Excuse O
me O
, O
but O
then O
certain O
playwrights O
in O
Flanders B-LOC
are O
a O
lot O
further O
along O
. O

I O
myself O
have O
become O
neither O
, O
precisely O
because O
I O
lack O
imagination O

Underneath O
the O
little O
tragedy O
there O
even O
seems O
to O
be O
some O
humor O

Third O
quote O
: O
" O
The O
intention O
is O
to O
play O
tasteless O
and O
bad O
theater O
, O
but O
the O
result O
is O
bad O

. O

Flemish B-MISC
theater O
will O
never O
be O
the O
same O
again O

If O
you O
talk O
about O
the O
better O
directors O
of O
the O
younger O
generation O
, O
there O
is O
hardly O
anyone O
. O

The O
rest O
is O
so O
general O

" O

" O
Damn O

Besides O
: O
what O
are O
we O
supposed O
to O
do O
with O
five O
acres O
of O
land O
? O

And O
, O
where O
are O
the O
new O
directors O
? O

No O
better O
word O
for O
it O
than O
authenticity O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
know O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
the O
cultural O
sector O
, O
and O
many O
of O
them O
have O
already O
received O
information O
about O
our O
whereabouts O

Those O
who O
want O
to O
come O
now O

better O
take O
that O
into O
account O

even O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
pay O
full O
price O

if O
you O

you O

Hilde B-PER

I O
each O
have O

Something O
a O
few O

Maybe O
then O
we O
will O
once O
again O
see O
a O
performance O
on O
which O
we O
can O
rely O
for O
half O
a O

There O
was O
a O
former O

in O
Mauzac B-LOC

Maybe O
in O

we O

it O

with O

we O
do O

have O
to O
catch O
up O
with O
things O

that O

" O
What O
bothers O
me O
most O
is O
that O
I O
see O
something O
coming O
too O
slowly O

too O
sporadically O
that O
makes O
you O
say O
: O
this O
is O
innovation O

Otherwise O
we O
just O
ca O
n't O
keep O
it O
up O

by O

we O

Now O
I O
see O
so O
few O
new O
ideas O

with O

I O
read O
somewhere O
that O
you O
learned O
that O
from O
your O
mother O
, O
at O
home O
at O
the O
Leuven B-MISC

You O
see O
all O
these O
young O
actors O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
schools O
and O
every O
year O
out O
of O
fifteen O
maybe O
only O
three O
are O
good O
, O
but O
that O
's O
still O
three O

I O
really O
do O
n't O

anymore O

to O
stretch O
his O

from O
time O

but O
in O
that O
movement O
he O
always O
picks O
up O
something O
visual O
that O
is O
not O

autonomous O

authentic O

So O
you O
would O
have O
to O
go O
to O
Bordeaux B-LOC
already O

Fourth O
quote O
. O

There O
is O
already O
investment O
in O
youth O
and O
training O
. O

I O
have O
lifted O
a O
few O
quotes O
from O
your O
reviews O
and O
you O
should O
guess O
which O
production O
it O
is O
about O
. O

As O
a O
reviewer O
, O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
follow O
them O
because O
the O
good O
ones O
will O
show O
up O
on O
their O
own O
after O
a O
while O
. O

Let O
it O
be O
done O
. O

-- O
see O
something O
interesting O
or O
poignant O
. O

I O
've O
had O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
to O
mentally O
adjust O
to O
that O
. O

Usually O
you O
only O
have O
two O
days O
off O
a O
week O
and O
then O
you O
have O
to O
drive O
twelve O
, O
thirteen O
hundred O
kilometers O
, O
not O
counting O
the O
driving O
around O
and O
searching O
on O
the O
spot O
. O

No O
, O
that O
's O
not O
possible O
. O
" O

We O
are O
not O
planning O
to O
put O
signs O
along O
the O
road O
in O
the O
region O
with O

' O
-- O
we O
are O
still O
waiting O
to O
see O
how O
the O
response O
is O
from O
Flanders B-LOC
. O

But O
our O
guests O
must O
realize O
-- O
now O
I O
'm O
not O
addressing O
friends O
and O
close O
acquaintances O
, O
but O
outsiders O
-- O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
them O
, O
except O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
rent O
a O
room O
and O
get O
breakfast O
. O

When O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
better O
theater O
directors O
in O
Flanders B-LOC
, O
we O
are O
still O
talking O
about O
the O
generation O
of O
Perceval B-PER
, O
Vandervost B-PER
and O
Bogaerts B-PER
. O

I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
denigrate O
that O
, O
but O
you O
are O
in O
Mauzac B-LOC
rather O
far O
from O
the O
cities O
of O
any O
significance O
. O

We O
have O
said O
it O
so O
many O
times O
, O
after O
yet O
another O
disappointing O
performance O
: O
goddamn O
, O
we O
had O
better O
go O
to O
a O
concert O
. O

Then O
real O
hotel O
standards O
apply O
and O
we O
do O
n't O
really O
want O
that O
. O

I O
do O
it O
myself O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
our O
lease O
on O
this O
house O
was O
about O
to O
end O
. O

I O
often O
read O
Libération B-ORG
and O
Le B-ORG
Monde I-ORG
and O
just O
as O
often O
found O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
see O
the O
line O
in O
the O
reviews O
. O

That O
is O
only O
120 O
kilometers O
away O
, O
but O
because O
there O
are O
no O
highways O
, O
it O
takes O
two O
and O
a O
half O
hours O
to O
get O
there O
. O

But O
as O
a O
prospector O
the O
past O
few O
years O
I O
have O
seen O
what O
is O
coming O
up O
of O
young O
people O
, O
and O
what O
the O
differences O
are O
between O
the O
drama O
schools O
. O
" O

There O
will O
be O
a O
separate O
breakfast O
room O
. O

Are O
you O
so O
sure O
about O
that O
? O

May O
I O
, O
by O
way O
of O
salute O
, O
ask O
a O
few O
quiz O
questions O
? O

Well O
the O
quiet O
life O
, O
where O
I O
actually O
count O
on O
good O
acquaintances O
and O
friends O
to O
drop O
by O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

It O
's O
already O
like O
that O
actually O
: O
we O
cancelled O
our O
television O
subscription O
two O
months O
ago O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
missed O
that O
thing O
for O
a O
second O
. O

" O
I O
absolutely O
will O
not O
miss O
that O
. O
" O

Then O
we O
responded O
to O
some O
ads O
, O
for O
houses O
in O
Bourges B-LOC
among O
others O
. O

Correct O
. O

" O
Agreed O

" O

We O
move O
at O
the O
end O
of O
June O
but O
we O
come O
back O
to O
Belgium B-LOC
immediately O
, O
because O
we O
have O
to O
take O
care O
of O
some O
administrative O
matters O

' O
Not O
for O
a O
fraction O
of O
a O
second O
was O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
drama O
touched O
here O

was O
there O
on O

an O

Just O
a O
quick O
theater O
question O
: O
how O
did O
the O
scouting O
go O

If O
you O
have O
no O
imagination O
as O
an O

, O
you O
should O
n't O
try O
to O
become O
a O
director O
. O

Just O
to O
say O
, O
we O
're O
not O
completely O
cut O
off O

about O

? O

Plus O
: O
what O
to O
select O
? O

Sitting O
at O
his O
table O
chain O
- O
smoking O
ís O
that O
text O
, O
treats O
it O
not O
as O
a O
foreign O
object O
but O
as O
the O
man O
who O
actually O
utters O
it O
, O
as O
a O
committed O
storyteller O
. O

With O
close O
acquaintances O
and O
friends O
it O
is O
so O
. O
" O

From O
the O
beat O
all O
emphasis O
is O
gone O
, O
the O
text O
emerges O
in O
its O
full O
value O
and O
through O
a O
tight O
tempo O
and O
a O
continuous O
lightness O
of O
tone O
gets O
its O
proper O
accents O
. O

The O
former O

an O
old O
station O
building O
in O
the O
French B-MISC
Dordogne B-LOC
together O
with O
his O
partner O
Hilde B-PER

Perhaps O
we O
will O
address O
ourselves O
initially O
to O
Flemish B-MISC

A O
quiet O
life O
, O
with O
friends O
who O
drop O

then O

Sometimes O
I O
went O
to O
see O
such O
a O
show O
myself O
and O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
the O
fuss O
was O
about O
. O

I O
have O
been O
there O
once O
for O
the O
paper O
and O
that O
may O
suffice O
. O

Fifth O
and O
final O
quote O
, O
from O
a O
very O
positive O
review O
yet O
: O
' O
The O
actor O
has O
disappeared O

it O

it O
almost O
has O
to O

about O

this O

expand O

Yet O
they O

something O

But O
that O
is O
a O
misrepresentation O

Friday O
morning O
, O
the O
first O
rays O
of O
sunlight O
hit O
our O
bedroom O
. O

All O
means O
are O
good O
to O
get O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
area O
, O
the O
house O
and O
, O
last O
but O
not O

, O
the O
people O
themselves O
. O

They O
live O
a O
stone O

It O
takes O
us O
two O
and O
a O
half O
hours O
to O
drive O
120 O
kilometers O
of O
winding O
roads O
. O

Afterwards O
we O
drive O
to O
the O
Cuckmere B-LOC

. O

What O
a O
contrast O
with O
Belgium B-LOC
! O

With O
home O
exchange O
is O
very O
unlikely O
, O
because O
you O
live O
among O
the O
people O
. O

But O
it O
's O
not O
like O
, O
judging O
by O
the O
local O
postcards O
, O
there O
's O
not O
a O
single O
car O
driving O
around O

" O
You O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
pay O
" O
, O
says O
an O
amiable O
woman O
. O

Driving O
on O
the O
left O
is O
not O
an O
impossible O
task O
and O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
quickly O
, O
but O
it O
does O
require O
the O
necessary O
concentration O
, O
which O
must O
not O
be O
slackened O
at O
any O
time O
. O

It O
is O
always O
best O
to O
give O

numbers O

Fortunately O
, O
the O
neighbors O
brought O
relief O
... O

No O
matter O
how O
we O
searched O
, O
the O
keys O
remained O
untraceable O
. O

There O
is O
no O
comparison O
possible O
, O
in O
our O
opinion O
. O

But O
of O
course O
that O
does O
not O
always O
work O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
travel O
to O
distant O
countries O
. O

At O
one O
point O
when O
we O
got O
home O
, O
we O
noticed O
that O
the O
saddles O
on O
our O
bikes O
had O
been O
switched O
. O

Those O
who O
are O
very O
fond O
of O
luxury O
and O
want O
to O
be O
served O
at O
their O
beck O
and O
call O
certainly O
do O
n't O
care O
for O
home O

Belgium B-LOC
does O
have O
its O
trump O

They O
are O
very O
enthusiastic O
about O
Belgian B-MISC
cuisine O
. O

But O
we O
would O
take O
our O
chances O
. O

It O
's O
a O
majestic O
sight O
. O

The O
next O
day O
we O
explore O
the O
coast O
of O
Eastbourne B-LOC
, O
about O
five O
miles O
from O
our O
swap O

. O

A O
brisk O
three O
- O
hour O
walk O
with O
panoramic O
views O
of O
Eastbourne B-LOC

makes O
us O
quickly O

On O

The O

Gert B-PER
tells O
me O
timidly O
that O
while O
vacuuming O
he O
accidentally O
touched O
the O
red O
button O
. O

Do O
you O
have O
to O
be O
polyglot O
? O

Should O
it O
be O
disappointing O
, O
it O
would O
remain O
a O
single O
experience O
. O

Because O
if O
misappropriations O
were O
rife O
, O
the O
home O

formula O
would O
not O
have O
had O
a O
long O
life O
. O

When O
we O
read O
an O
article O
about O
home O
exchange O
in O
1990 O
, O
we O
were O
not O
immediately O
enthusiastic O
. O

Gert B-PER
noticed O
that O
our O
back O
tire O
was O
deflating O
again O
. O

Turns O
out O
that O
people O
are O
often O
surprised O
by O
the O
language O
skills O
of O
the O
Belgians B-MISC
. O

Who O
can O
remain O
unmoved O
by O
so O
much O
natural O
beauty O
? O

We O
use O
the O
last O
day O
for O
shopping O
. O

Not O
a O
cloud O
in O
the O
sky O
. O

This O
trip O
is O
a O
fluke O
because O
the O
sun O
is O
back O
on O

Suddenly O
the O

goes O
off O

Rob B-PER

to O
put O

, O
you O

We O

Where O

? O

Ten O
experiences O
taught O
us O
that O

But O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
you O

A O
question O
often O
asked O
is O
this O
: O
" O
Has O
nothing O

Some O
years O
back O

in O

The O
basic O
idea O
behind O
it O
all O
? O

English B-MISC
will O
get O
you O
anywhere O
, O
but O
usually O
it O
is O
a O
plus O
if O

At O

After O
all O
, O
the O
steering O

of O
our O

is O
in O
the O

In O
the O

we O
strolled O
along O

Numerous O

use O
the O

no O

it O

In O

early O

, O
the O
traditional O
geuze O
finally O
gets O
the O
attention O
it O
deserves O
. O

This O
variety O
is O
less O
suitable O
as O
a O

it O
is O
small O

little O

Nevertheless O
, O
we O
compare O
it O

You O

For O
this O

The O

it O

The O

the O

Just O
like O

ordinary O
lambic O
, O
the O
brewer O
or O

( O

from O
different O
vintages O
and O
allows O
them O
to O
referment O
in O
the O

This O
is O
why O
the O
cherries O
are O
usually O
bottled O
in O

, O
where O
they O
remain O
for O
an O

that O

that O

The O
ideal O
is O
to O
keep O
the O
cherries O
on O
the O
tree O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
until O
they O
shrivel O

' O

keep O

soften O
the O

The O
Italian B-MISC
artist O

hidden O
the O

of O
the O

as O
it O
were O

behind O

tens O

piled O

some O
time O
now O
the O

been O
declared O
taboo O

we O

it O
only O
among O

In O

( O
some O

an O

alternately O
in O

the O

After O
the O

been O
able O
to O
meditate O
for O
a O
moment O
on O
the O

almost O
ethereal O
beauty O
he O
is O
confronted O
in O
the O

In O
the O

the O

Fuller B-MISC

in O
the O
combination O

this O

It O

But O
gradually O

recognized O
that O

more O
than O

such O
as O
the O
1938 O

Fuller B-PER
immediately O

he O
built O
a O

In O

, O
he O
designed O
his O
circular O
