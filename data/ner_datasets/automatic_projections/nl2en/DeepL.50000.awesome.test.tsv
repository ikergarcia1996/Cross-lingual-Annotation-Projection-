The O
ailing O
currency O
has O
been O
giving O
the O
ECB B-ORG
headaches O
and O
a O
bad O
image O
for O
months O

The O
U.S. B-MISC
economy O

expected O

grow O
by O
about O
4.9 O
percent O
this O
year O
against O
3.4 O
percent O
in O
the O
euro O
zone O
. O

The O
rise O
in O
interest O
rates O
is O
intended O
to O
curb O
inflation O
. O

The O
decline O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
difference O
in O
growth O
rate O
between O
the O
U.S. B-MISC
and O
European B-MISC
economies O
. O

After O
the O
announcement O
of O
the O
interest O
rate O
increase O
, O
the O
euro O
slipped O
further O
, O
from O
0.8950 O

0.8844 O

Unemployment O
in O
France B-LOC

unexpectedly O
rose O
in O
July O
for O
the O
first O

Thus O
Ireland B-LOC

three O

more O
than O
the O

announced O
yesterday O
that O
it O
will O
quell O
the O
inflation O
threat O
with O
any O
new O
interest O
rate O

Inflation O
is O
fuelled O
by O
the O
weak O

by O
the O
sharp O
increase O

prices O

The O
price O

According O

him O

the O
ECB B-ORG

that O
strategy O

Consumer O
prices O

to O
2.4 O
percent O
last O

more O
than O
the O
2 O
percent O
that O
the O
bank O
sets O
as O
a O
maximum O
for O
price O
stability O
. O

The O
loss O
since O
its O
introduction O
in O
early O
1999 O
is O
already O
25 O
percent O

the O

I O
think O
the O
criticism O
is O
very O
important O

The O

must O
be O
able O
to O
accept O
the O
limitations O
in O
order O
not O
to O
lose O
his O
character O
, O
but O
must O
also O
be O
free O
enough O
to O
do O
what O
is O
necessary O
to O
tell O
the O

highlights O

Yet O
you O
manage O
to O
make O
them O
shine O
one O
by O
one O
. O

His O
pieces O
are O
about O
ordinary O
people O

in O
an O
artful O
but O
lively O
Flemish B-MISC
that O
is O
full O
of O
archaisms O

alternately O
grafted O

Do O
you O
think O
: O
The O
critics O
have O
n't O
looked O
very O
closely O
before O
? O

-DOCSTART- O
They O
always O
talk O
about O
their O

I O
do O
n't O
mind O
if O
it O
stays O

I O

no O

up O

can O
there O

That O
is O
not O
the O
intention O
at O
all O

I O
expect O
in O
the O

of O
September O

As O
long O
as O
they O
have O
no O
interest O
in O

it O
will O
be O
difficult O
to O
bring O
about O
that O
revaluation O
, O
or O
just O
call O
it O
appreciation O
. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
am O
also O
in O
favor O
of O
greater O
uniformity O
in O

The O

A O
few O
years O

this O
was O
not O
the O
case O

but O
I O
think O
in O
the O
meantime O
something O
has O
changed O

Even O
if O
not O
everyone O
joins O
in O

" O

That O
shows O
that O
the O
pigeonholing O

is O
still O
very O
large O
. O
" O

Without O
saying O
that O
I O
want O
to O
abolish O
the O

I O
argue O
for O
greater O
openness O

more O
cooperation O

In O
my O
opinion O

be O
able O
to O
sit O
together O

practical O
lessons O
without O
the O

I O

In O

, O
there O
absolutely O
must O

It O
's O
better O
for O
the O

they O
ca O

I O
think O

a O
number O

opportunities O
by O

encourage O
them O

possibly O
in O

way O

Let O

start O
with O
the O
most O
practical O
subjects O

work O
out O
one O

for O
them O

" O
If O
you O
start O
forcing O
and O
coercing O
, O
you O
are O
asking O
for O
trouble O

In O
many O
regions O
the O
different O

have O
not O
even O
tried O
to O
start O

I O
think O
they O
find O
the O
atmosphere O
and O
mentality O
in O
a O
school O
much O
more O
important O
. O
" O

It O
has O
to O
stay O
that O
way O

" O

Dewael B-PER

already O
made O
sure O
that O
all O

not O

the O
revaluation O

" O
His O
proposal O
is O
presented O
more O
radical O
than O
it O
really O

If O
not O
, O
I O
will O
come O
up O
with O
some O
general O
propositions O
at O

You O
can O
not O
continue O

provide O
all O
those O
schools O
with O
the O
necessary O
equipment O
separately O

But O
that O
had O
the O
advantage O
that O
the O
discussion O
immediately O
got O
going O

" O
In O
the O
end O
, O
it O
's O
all O
about O
the O
needs O
of O
the O

Something O
else O

The O
CVP B-ORG
presents O
it O
as O
if O
we O
want O
to O
strive O
for O
a O
kind O
of O
uniformity O

Look O
at O
technical O
and O

Look O
at O
the O
decree O

So O
we O
would O
prefer O
to O
come O
to O
one O
decree O
legal O
position O
for O
all O

with O
an O
occasional O
split O
( O
if O
there O

no O
other O
way O

between O
official O
and O

" O
And O
finally O
, O
there O
is O
the O
deregulation O
that O
is O
in O
the O
Flemish B-MISC
coalition O
agreement O

Now O
we O
have O
to O
see O
how O
far O
we O
get O
during O
the O

discussions O

You O

At O
the O

the O

it O

The O
first O
BIN B-ORG
was O
set O
up O
six O
years O
ago O
in O
Poperinge B-LOC

at O
a O
time O
when O
the O

was O
suffering O
greatly O
from O
burglaries O
by O
the O
Kappa B-ORG
gang I-ORG

a O
group O
of O
northern B-MISC
Frenchmen I-MISC
who O
were O
mainly O
targeting O
sports O
stores O

more O
expensive O
clothing O
stores O

But O
what O
can O
a O
BIN B-ORG
do O
if O
the O
police O
commissioner O
decides O
to O
ignore O
the O
report O
? O

However O
, O
these O
were O
initiatives O
that O
were O
heavily O
criticized O
at O
the O
time O
from O
different O
angles O

Moreover O
, O
we O
also O
want O
better O
quality O
control O
of O
the O
projects O
and O
more O
support O

that O
fighting O

was O
an O

The O

Hans B-PER

Daan B-PER

The O
concept O
of O
' O
mobility O
' O
must O
make O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
is O
about O
much O
more O
than O
the O
car O
traffic O
that O
is O
increasingly O
getting O
caught O
up O
in O
traffic O

. O

Otherwise O
it O
should O
be O
adapted O
at O
the O
federal O
level O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
so O
that O
not O
only O
public O
utility O
but O
also O
safety O
can O
be O
invoked O
for O
bicycle O
paths O
in O
order O
to O
expropriate O
easily O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
Antwerp B-MISC
ring O
road O
will O
bring O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
buses O
( O
and O
streetcars O
) O
. O

The O
implementation O
will O
be O
another O

If O
in O
Antwerp B-LOC
the O
buses O
can O
run O
on O
average O
6 O
km O
per O
hour O
faster O
, O
it O
will O
yield O
400 O
million O

The O

of O
themselves O
that O
they O
should O
pay O
more O
attention O

their O

outside O

that O
they O
should O
use O

Teachers O
generally O
feel O
that O
their O

only O
two O

no O

if O

why O

But O
should O
the O
school O
be O
a O
place O
where O
children O
only O
go O
because O
they O
want O
to O
? O

Moreover O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
an O
extracurricular O
education O
eliminates O
class O
differences O
. O

This O
can O
be O
done O
, O
for O
example O
, O
by O
creating O
education O
centers O
that O
welcome O
both O
parents O
and O
children O
, O
to O
prevent O
too O
early O
separation O
. O

Yes O
. O
' O

But O
move O
there O
anyway O
, O
because O
those O
families O
are O
afraid O
of O
the O
reactions O
of O
the O
family O
, O

The O
downside O
is O
that O
the O
home O

children O
, O
as O
the O
years O
go O
by O
, O
do O
not O
continue O

perform O
so O
well O

To O
some O

Even O
though O
67 O

of O
the O

did O
not O
even O
have O
an O
educational O
background O

" O
Why O
not O
use O
some O

, O
to O
financially O
support O
the O

who O
wish O
to O

themselves O

And O
she O
is O

in O
this O

the O

The O
" O

principle O
completely O
ignores O
the O

that O
arise O
when O
a O

says O
" O

" O
to O

. O

I O
am O
not O
saying O
that O
in O
Flanders B-LOC
it O
already O
reaches O
such O
proportions O
, O

this O
American B-MISC
approach O
can O
cause O
a O
lot O
of O

influence O

According O

the O

the O

those O

After O

During O

it O

that O

however O

According O
to O
Symoens B-PER

there O

up O

the O

In O
general O
, O
the O
VAD B-ORG
advises O

when O
drug O

is O
detected O
: O
" O
Try O

Earlier O

that O
the O
higher O

also O
has O
a O
clear O
impact O
on O
smoking O
behavior O
. O

Despite O
the O
health O
warning O
, O
many O
smokers O
think O
that O
smoking O
light O
cigarettes O
is O
synonymous O
with O
' O
safe O
' O
smoking O
and O
so O
they O
switched O
to O
these O
cigarettes O
instead O
of O
quitting O
. O

Anno O
2000 O
every O
smoker O
knows O
that O
his O
cigarette O
is O
harmful O
to O
himself O
and O
his O
fellow O
man O
. O

It O
must O
be O
said O
, O
however O
, O
that O
this O
increase O
affects O
mainly O
younger O
smokers O
because O
they O
are O
more O
sensitive O
to O
measures O
taken O
by O
their O

. O

If O
smokers O
were O
no O
longer O
exposed O
to O
tempting O

, O
the O
overall O
consumption O

would O
fall O

at O

6 O
percent O
according O
to O
the O
WHO B-ORG
. O

On O
that O

, O
the O

Due O
to O
the O

that O

there O
is O
still O
uncertainty O

everything O

everything O

if O

The O

who O
, O
before O
succumbing O
to O
the O
effects O
of O
an O
overdose O
at O
the O
age O
of O
28 O
, O
had O
left O
behind O
some O
nine O
records O
, O
would O
always O
weigh O
heavily O
on O
him O
. O

That O
is O
certainly O
a O
good O
reason O
to O
go O
see O
the O
film O
. O

To O
a O
journalist O
from O
NRC B-ORG
Handelsblad I-ORG
, O
Fekovic B-PER
stated O
that O
Jeff B-PER
Buckley I-PER
however O
was O
mainly O
conditioned O
and O
molded O
by O
his O
mother O
, O
who O
tried O
to O
make O
him O
a O
substitute O
for O
her O
runaway O
husband O
. O

Jeff B-PER
wanted O
to O
be O
different O
and O
better O
than O
his O
father O
, O
but O
the O
irony O
is O
that O
his O
career O
really O
took O
off O
after O
he O
performed O
one O
of O
Tim B-MISC
's I-MISC
songs O
at O
a O
memorial O
service O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Jasmina B-MISC
Fekovic I-MISC
's I-MISC
documentary O
also O
shows O
that O
Jeff B-PER
Buckley I-PER
dealt O
with O
the O
media O
in O
a O
more O
calculated O
way O
and O
was O
much O
more O
concerned O
with O
himself O
than O
is O
usually O
assumed O
. O

Jasmina B-PER
Fekovic I-PER
filmed O
both O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC

where O
Buckley B-PER
lived O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
and O
in O
Memphis B-LOC
where O
he O
spent O
his O
last O
days O
. O

According O
to O
the O
filmmaker O
, O
however O
, O
the O
title O
refers O
primarily O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
her O
graduation O
project O
is O
both O
an O
introduction O
to O
and O
a O
farewell O
to O
the O
singer O
. O

If O
there O
is O
room O
again O

today O
for O
passion O
and O

many O

That O

why O

came O
not O
only O
from O

also O
your O

you O
in O

" O

The O

needs O
to O
be O

" O

That O
probably O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
become O
such O
a O
technical O
matter O
. O

And O
then O
I O
usually O
hear O
things O
that O
are O
important O

I O
think O
we O
should O
definitely O
talk O
about O
it O

But O
before O

even O
sat O
down O
together O
once O
, O
the O

announced O
that O
they O
would O
be O

we O

really O

already O

still O
attached O

However O
, O
when O
you O
hear O
the O

complaints O
over O

over O
again O
in O
ten O

then O
you O
know O
something O
is O
going O
on O
. O

What O
is O
the O
meaning O
of O
free O
choice O
and O
how O
will O
we O
fill O
it O
in O
the O

? O

I O
want O
to O
have O
that O
debate O
. O

Only O
a O
differentiated O
approach O
is O
much O
more O
difficult O
, O
because O
then O
you O
have O
to O
build O
in O

: O
if O
it O
goes O
wrong O
in O

it O
will O
also O
go O

" O
Besides O
, O
I O
wonder O
when O
the O

say O
they O
represent O
the O
entire O

Wednesday O
the O

That O

a O

I O
want O

enter O

It O
