The O

The O

Somewhat O

said O
that O
there O
could O
not O

carefully O

I O
expect O

As O
long O
as O
they O
are O
not O

it O
will O
be O
difficult O
to O
achieve O
that O
revaluation O

That O
is O
why O
I O
am O
in O
favour O
of O
greater O
uniformity O
in O

" O
The O

also O
improve O

years O

that O
was O
not O
the O
case O

I O
think O
something O
has O
changed O
in O
the O
meantime O

Even O
if O
not O
everyone O
does O

That O
shows O
that O
the O
box O

is O
still O
very O
large O

" O

Without O

that O
I O
want O
to O
abolish O

I O
call O

greater O
openness O

greater O

In O

I O
think O
that O
we O
should O
create O
a O
number O
of O
possibilities O
and O
encourage O
them O
, O
possibly O
in O
a O
financial O
way O
. O

Let O

start O
with O
the O
most O
practical O
courses O
and O
work O
out O
one O
curriculum O
for O
them O
. O

" O
If O
you O
're O
going O

you O
're O
going O

In O
many O
regions O
, O
the O
various O
networks O
have O
not O
even O
tried O
to O
initiate O
cooperation O
. O

I O
think O
they O
think O
the O
atmosphere O
and O
mentality O
at O
a O
school O
is O
much O
more O
important O
. O
" O

It O
has O
to O
stay O
that O
way O
. O
" O

Dewael B-PER
has O
already O
ensured O
that O
all O
involved O
are O
in O
the O
trenches O

We O
have O
not O
heard O
much O
about O
your O
action O
plan O
for O
the O
revaluation O
of O
vocational O
and O
technical O

. O

" O
His O
proposal O
is O
more O
radical O
than O
it O
really O
was O
. O

If O
not O
, O
I O
come O
to O
the O
opening O
of O
the O

year O
myself O
with O
a O
number O
of O
general O
statements O
. O
" O

Members O

also O

edition O

You O
ca O
n't O
keep O
supplying O
all O
those O
schools O
separately O
with O
the O
necessary O
equipment O

But O
that O
had O
the O
advantage O
of O
getting O
the O
discussion O
started O
right O
away O

" O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O

it O
's O
about O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
students O

Something O
else O
. O

The O
CVP B-ORG
proposes O
it O
as O
if O
we O
want O
to O
strive O
for O
some O
sort O
of O
unitary O
sausage O
. O

Look O
at O
technical O
and O
vocational O
education O
. O

Look O
at O
the O
secondary O

decree O

For O
example O
, O
we O
would O
prefer O
to O
have O
one O
decree O
legal O
status O
for O
all O
networks O
, O
with O
occasional O
split O
- O
up O
( O
if O
possible O
) O
between O
official O
and O
free O
education O
. O

" O
And O
finally O
, O
there O
is O
the O
deregulation O
that O
is O
contained O
in O
the O
Flemish B-MISC
coalition O
agreement O
. O

Now O
we O
need O
to O
see O
how O
far O
we O
get O
during O
the O
budget O
talks O
. O

page O

You O
should O
not O
forget O
that O
the O
university O
world O
is O
a O
rather O
small O
world O
in O
which O
territorial O
delineation O
is O
quite O
important O

let O
it O

that O

felt O
that O

should O
also O
take O
responsibility O

More O
worrying O
is O
that O
a O

of O

have O
told O
third O
parties O
that O
the O

was O
conceived O
via O

not O
the O

itself O

KID B-MISC
children I-MISC
often O
try O
to O
process O
their O

by O
building O

which O
is O
largely O

on O

The O
Flemish B-MISC
children O

then O
divided O
into O
two O
classes O

which O
meant O
that O
in O
the O

only O
children O
of O
Turkish B-MISC
origin O

" O
Berkenbos B-LOC

already O

almost O
50 O

immigrant O
students O
, O
and O
is O
well O
on O
the O
way O
to O
becoming O
a O
concentration O
school O
. O
" O

That O
means O
that O
a O
free O
school O
, O
once O
it O
reaches O
that O
threshold O
, O
may O
refuse O
immigrant O
students O
. O

And O
, O
so O
it O
sounds O

there O

enough O

done O

the O

Davenport B-PER

so O

For O

better O

The O
first O

started O
six O
years O
ago O
in O
Poperinge B-LOC
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O

suffered O
from O
burglaries O
by O
the O
Kappa B-ORG
gang I-ORG
, O
a O
group O
of O
northern B-MISC
French I-MISC
people I-MISC
who O
mainly O
targeted O
sports O

more O
expensive O
clothing O

But O
what O
can O
a O
BIN B-ORG
do O
if O
the O
police O
commissioner O
decides O
to O
patch O
the O
report O
to O
his O
boot O

These O
were O
, O
however O
, O
initiatives O

were O
heavily O
attacked O
from O

In O

we O
also O
want O
better O
quality O
control O
of O

more O
support O

: O
" O
I O

really O
understand O
why O
the O

getting O
so O
negative O
about O

And O
immediately O
there O

You O
first O
hear O
that O
there O
are O
so O
many O
candidates O

and O
later O
that O
Catholic O

does O
not O
want O

cooperate O

For O
a O
moment O
he O
was O
also O
an O

The O

provided O
the O
necessary O
twitching O
between O
the O
Department O

Education B-ORG
and O
Catholic O

, O
but O
can O
now O
blow O
out O
of O
the O

And O
for O
many O
, O
the O

were O
the O
final O
trigger O
that O
made O
them O
choose O
a O
career O

The O

complain O
because O
no O
one O
wants O

" O
Yes O

it O

feeling O

that O
the O

will O
step O
down O
massively O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
school O

, O
simply O
because O
they O
can O
retain O
their O
old O

But O
education O
lures O

not O
because O
he O

All O
the O

kept O
their O

away O

the O

sometimes O
out O
of O

Girls O
perform O

those O
who O

After O
all O

still O
undervalued O
by O

Girls O
opt O
for O
a O

where O
they O
score O

actually O
study O
below O

This O

it O

With O
19.3 O

33.5 O

, O
the O
differences O
are O
downright O
remarkable O
. O

As O
in O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
, O
teachers O
must O
be O
accompanied O
throughout O
the O

This O
is O
even O
apparent O

Therefore O
there O

drop O

up O

A O

that O

consider O
that O

are O
best O
explicitly O
stating O
that O
they O
openly O
address O
any O

The O
central O
message O
was O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
at O
every O
school O
to O
develop O
a O

That O
's O
okay O

end O
it O
's O
about O
a O
certain O
atmosphere O

become O
open O
to O

The O
point O
is O
that O

Despite O
the O

many O

think O
that O
smoking O
light O

synonymous O

so O
they O
switched O

these O

that O

harmful O

However O
, O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
this O

Freinet B-MISC

lucky O

had O
sufficient O
confidence O

to O
immerse O
his O
child O
in O
it O

That O
is O
the O
criticism O
from O
a O
traditional O
angle O
, O
which O
wonders O
whether O
children O
can O
make O
it O
clear O
what O
they O
want O
. O

And O
even O
now O
that O
it O
penetrates O
traditional O
education O
, O
there O
are O
comments O
. O

In O
traditional O
education O
everything O
is O
beautifully O
put O
into O
a O
programme O
, O
but O
we O
also O
manage O
to O
offer O
everything O
that O
traditional O
education O
offers O
. O
" O

For O
example O
, O
if O
a O
month O
is O
no O
longer O
painted O
, O
because O
the O
children O
do O
not O
insist O
on O
it O
, O
the O

will O
somehow O
put O
it O
on O
the O

The O

who O
, O
before O
succumbing O

the O
effects O
of O
an O

at O

had O
left O
nine O

always O

heavily O
on O
him O

That O
's O
definitely O
a O
good O
reason O
to O
watch O
the O
movie O
. O

To O
a O
journalist O
from O
NRC B-ORG
Handelsblad I-ORG
, O
Fekovic B-PER
stated O
that O
Jeff B-PER
Buckley I-PER
was O
mainly O
conditioned O
and O
kneaded O
by O
his O
mother O
, O
who O
tried O
to O
make O
him O
a O
substitute O
for O
her O
runaway O
husband O
. O

Jeff B-PER
wanted O
to O
be O
different O
and O
better O
than O
his O
father O
, O
but O
the O
irony O
is O
that O
his O
career O
did O
n't O
really O
start O
to O
get O
off O
the O
ground O
until O
he O
had O
performed O
one O
of O
Tim B-MISC
's I-MISC
songs O
during O
a O
memorial O
ceremony O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Jasmina B-MISC
Fekovic I-MISC
's I-MISC
documentary O
also O
shows O
that O
Jeff B-PER
Buckley I-PER
dealt O
with O
the O
media O
in O
a O
more O
calculated O
way O
and O
was O
much O
more O
concerned O
with O
himself O
than O
is O
usually O
assumed O
. O

Jasmina B-PER
Fekovic I-PER
filmed O
both O
in O

lived O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
and O
in O
Memphis B-LOC
where O
he O
slept O
his O
last O
days O
. O

According O
to O
the O
creator O
, O
however O
, O
the O
title O
refers O
mainly O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
her O
graduation O
project O
is O
at O
the O
same O
time O
an O
introduction O
to O

a O
farewell O
to O
the O

there O
is O
room O
for O
passion O
and O

for O

If O

can O
work O
with O
small O
groups O
in O

the O
joy O
of O

can O
be O

And O
of O

you O
hear O
many O
different O

that O

what O

did O
not O

At O
the O
time O
of O
Luc B-PER
Van I-PER

Bossche I-PER
many O
problems O
were O
discussed O
in O
a O
much O
more O
open O
way O

" O

That O
is O
why O
I O
am O
against O

I O
'm O
not O
going O

Even O
before O
the O

on O
a O
collective O
agreement O
for O
the O
next O
two O
years O
began O
, O
it O
came O
to O
a O
clash O
with O
the O
Christian O
educational O
associations O
. O

More O
cooperation O
between O
the O
various O
networks O
is O
absolutely O
necessary O
. O

Not O
only O
from O
a O
Christian O
angle O
, O
your O
own O
party O

also O
put O
you O
in O
the O
wind O
during O
the O
discussion O
with O
Frank B-PER
Vandenbroucke I-PER
about O
educational O
pensions O
. O

There O
has O
been O
an O
extremely O
negative O
opposition O
over O
the O
last O
year O
. O

But O
if O
there O
are O
34 O
electricians O
, O
plumbers O
and O
coiffeurs O
in O
your O
class O
, O
you O
have O
a O
heavy O
job O
. O
" O

The O
style O
needs O
to O
be O
changed O
urgently O
. O
" O

This O
probably O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
become O
such O
a O
technical O
matter O
. O

And O
then O
I O
usually O
hear O
things O
that O
are O
important O
. O

I O
think O
we O
should O
definitely O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

quiet O

" O
In O
Parliament O
, O
it O
appears O
difficult O
to O
establish O
an O
open O
discussion O
between O
majority O
and O
opposition O
. O

But O
most O
of O
the O
time O
the O
people O
on O
the O
premises O
themselves O
like O
that O
they O
can O
tell O
their O
story O
to O
the O
one O
who O
has O
to O
turn O
the O
lines O
off O
. O

How O
can O
the O
career O
be O
completed O
more O
flexibly O
? O

But O
apparently O
they O
think O
everything O
that O
comes O
from O
the O
majority O
is O
bad O
in O
advance O
. O

I O
want O
to O
talk O
to O
both O
the O
domes O
and O
the O
unions O
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O
base O

do O
not O
do O

My O

said O
that O

" O
We O
urgently O
need O
to O
force O
a O
breakthrough O
. O

But O
before O
we O
sat O
together O
once O
, O
the O
Christian O
trade O
unions O
already O
announced O
that O
they O
would O
argue O
. O

" O
But O
we O
ca O
n't O
really O
be O
specific O
yet O
: O
in O
May O
, O
we O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
no O
money O
for O
a O
general O
wage O
increase O
now O
. O

" O
Everyone O
apparently O
still O
clings O
to O
his O
political O
party O
, O
to O
his O
column O
, O
to O
his O
organization O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
hear O
the O
same O
complaints O
in O
ten O
schools O
each O
time O
, O
you O
know O
that O
something O
is O
going O
on O
. O

What O
is O
the O
meaning O
of O
free O
choice O
and O
how O
are O
we O
going O
to O
fill O
it O
in O
in O
the O
future O
? O

I O
want O
to O
have O
that O
debate O
. O

However O
, O
a O
differentiated O
approach O
is O
much O
more O
difficult O
, O
because O
then O
you O
have O
to O
build O
in O
many O
criteria O
. O

Only O
: O
if O
it O
fails O
in O
education O
, O
it O
will O
also O
fail O
in O
society O
. O

" O
By O
the O
way O
, O
I O
am O
asking O
questions O
when O
the O
unions O
say O
they O
represent O
the O
entire O
staff O
. O

On O
Wednesday O
, O
Minister O
COC B-ORG

announced O
that O

not O

That O

be O
a O

I O
want O
to O
take O
them O
in O

Since O
their O
creation O
in O
the O

have O
undergone O
a O
profound O
evolution O

says O

" O
Because O

what O
it O

really O
about O

" O
However O
, O
it O
appears O
in O
families O
where O
emotions O
are O
difficult O
to O
put O
into O
words O

so O
that O
the O
child O
is O
on O
its O
own O

The O
producers O

leave O
little O
to O
the O
concerns O
of O

" O
It O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
that O

deal O
with O
a O

which O
is O
fully O

In O
such O
a O
case O

a O
child O
can O
be O
happy O

it O
owns O

And O
it O

The O
very O
last O

the O
complexity O

is O
immediately O

eliminated O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
communication O
should O
not O
be O
done O
via O
a O

A O

" O
First O
of O
all O
, O
you O
can O
ask O
questions O
when O

The O

exemplary O

that O
can O
also O
be O
said O
of O

The O

the O

The O

This O

remains O
a O

therefore O
the O

Finally O

say O
that O
this O

a O

even O
