" O
The O

have O
long O

a O
party O

an O

If O

Therefore O

in O

it O

even O
be O

General O

Prime O

offered O
the O
Palestinians B-MISC
a O
real O
state O
that O
would O
encompass O
almost O
the O

he O
came O
up O

offered O

sovereignty O
over O
the O
Arab B-MISC
parts O

Either O
you O

admit O
that O
you O

you O

I O

I O

is O
that O

it O

that O

something O

" O

Moreels B-PER
was O
going O
to O
ask O
for O
information O
from O
the O
urban O
planning O
department O
. O

" O
The O
placement O
of O
the O
water O
cherry O

is O
part O
of O
a O
global O
plan O
to O
renovate O
all O
the O
villages O
in O
the O
Zwalm B-MISC
region O
, O
" O
explains O
Eeckhout B-PER
. O

But O
the O
construction O
is O
clearly O
not O
to O
the O
liking O
of O
some O
villagers O
. O

After O
a O
long O
push O
they O
finally O
admitted O
yesterday O
that O
the O
municipality O
has O
a O
problem O
: O
the O
permit O
for O
building O
the O
fountain O
is O
not O
yet O
in O
order O
. O

" O
In O
Roobost B-LOC
the O
old O
cobblestones O
were O
already O
renewed O
and O
there O
are O
still O
some O
works O
on O

. O

Each O
village O
also O
gets O
a O
statue O
that O
pays O
tribute O
to O
the O
local O
speciality O

So O
it O
's O
just O
a O
matter O
of O

" O
We O
've O
always O
known O
there O
was O
something O
mysterious O
going O
on O
, O
" O
says O
Patrick B-PER
Moreels I-PER
, O
who O
lives O
right O
opposite O
the O
future O
image O
. O

We O
were O
only O
told O
that O
there O
was O
a O
large O
fountain O
, O
containing O
a O
statue O
of O
the O
water O
cherry O
picker O
. O
" O

He O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
there O
was O
an O
oral O
agreement O
with O
the O
authorised O
civil O
servant O
of O
urban O
planning O
that O
the O
permit O
would O
be O
available O
in O
the O
near O
future O
, O
perhaps O
even O
before O
the O
picture O
was O
revealed O
on O
Sunday O
. O

" O
We O
can O
not O
help O
it O
that O
it O
is O
currently O
a O
period O
of O
leave O
and O
that O
delivery O
is O
therefore O

Moreels B-PER

who O

, O
then O
went O
to O
the O
State O
Guard O
yesterday O
and O
made O
a O
report O
. O

According O
to O
Eeckhout B-PER
, O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
did O
not O
yet O
have O
a O
building O
permit O
when O
he O
started O

is O

We O

clause O

the O
promise O
that O
we O
will O
not O

Today O
Brogno B-PER

would O
just O

The O
great O
culprit O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
Westerlo B-LOC
is O
Dante B-PER
Brogno I-PER
, O
who O
offered O
his O

a O
price O
far O
below O

throughout O
Europe B-LOC

at O
a O
time O
when O
European B-MISC
regulation O
did O
not O
allow O

The O
French B-MISC
club O
Metz B-LOC
made O
an O
offer O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
July O
and O
there O
were O
also O
extensive O
discussions O
with O
the O
trainer O

" O
That O
was O
certainly O
a O
disillusionment O
for O
Toni B-PER
, O
" O
says O
Wijnants B-PER
. O

" O
But O
if O
you O
as O
a O
top O
shooter O
do O
n't O
find O
a O
team O
you O
want O
, O
then O
you O
have O
to O
ask O
yourself O
questions O

We O
certainly O
did O

ask O

that O

that O

then O

be O
taken O
seriously O

For O

there O
was O

it O

" O

At O

they O

full O

And O
he O

Toni B-PER
Brogni I-PER
does O
not O
get O
away O
from O
the O
Kuipje B-LOC
, O
where O
he O
found O
shelter O
in O

The O

in O

waits O
for O
him O
to O
become O
a O
free O
agent O

not O

the O
Kempense B-MISC
club O

The O
soap O
opera O
around O
Toni B-PER
Brogno I-PER
is O
almost O
over O

Westerlo B-LOC
does O
not O
want O

put O
any O
strobe O
in O
his O
way O
, O
says O
Wijnants B-PER
with O
the O
hand O
on O
the O
heart O
. O

Attacker O
has O
to O
decide O
his O
future O
to O
restore O
peace O
to O
Westerlo B-LOC

General O

For O
example O
, O
he O
told O
that O
Toni B-PER
Brogno I-PER
at O
Anderlecht B-LOC
could O
earn O
24 O
million O
francs O
in O
three O
years O
. O

And O
that O
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
more O
if O
Brogno B-PER
had O
n't O
let O
his O
head O
get O
crazy O
by O
" O

" O
from O
domestic O

foreign O
clubs O

Wijnants B-PER
: O
" O
They O
are O
also O
dependent O
on O

and O
require O
that O
we O
bring O
an O
equivalent O
team O

Westerlo B-LOC

It O
stimulates O
Wijnants B-PER
to O
pay O
more O
attention O
to O
these O
news O
than O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
Westerlo B-LOC
offered O
five O
youth O
players O
a O
serious O
professional O
contract O
. O

Brogno B-MISC

frustrations O
continued O
to O
increase O
when O
the O

We O

If O

he O

that O

His O

that O

He O
does O

see O
a O
Belgian B-MISC

That O

The O
demand O
for O

also O
from O
Anglo B-MISC

The O
fact O
is O
that O
real O

is O
no O

the O

it O

be O
even O
more O

it O
also O
occurs O

that O

Real O

That O

On O

it O

Moreover O
, O
as O
a O
bonus O
, O
the O
real O

specialists O
hope O
that O
inflation O
will O
continue O
to O
go O
badly O
in O
the O
long O
term O
. O

If O
young O
people O
become O
increasingly O
rare O
, O
they O
can O
make O
demands O
on O
the O
labour O
market O
and O
increase O
their O
price O
. O

The O
course O
of O
a O
winner O
can O
multiply O
. O

But O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it O
's O
possible O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Belgium B-LOC
, O
transaction O
costs O
are O
included O
in O
the O

That O

the O
famous O
story O

Thus O
, O
of O
course O
, O
a O
large O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
of O
the O

for O
the O
buyer O
is O
lost O

Theoretically O
it O
sounds O
very O
good O
