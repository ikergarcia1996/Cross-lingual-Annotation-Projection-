The O

its O
introduction O
in O
1999 O
has O
already O
been O
25 O
percent O
in O
relation O
to O
the O

. O

The O
higher O
interest O
rates O
make O

threaten O

undermine O

I O
think O
the O

must O
be O
able O
to O
accept O
the O
limitations O
in O
order O
not O
to O
lose O
the O
character O
, O
but O
also O
to O
be O
free O
enough O
to O
do O
what O

And O
cockroaches B-MISC

You O

But O
the O
advantage O

that O

that O
the O

started O
immediately O

After O
all O

it O
's O
about O
the O

Something O
else O

The O
CVP B-ORG
suggests O
it O
's O
as O
if O
we O
want O
to O
aim O
for O
a O
kind O
of O
unity O
harvest O
. O

Look O
at O
technical O

training O
. O

Look O
at O
the O
charter O

we O

like O
to O
have O
a O
one O

sometimes O
a O

between O

formal O

. O

And O
finally O
, O
there O
's O
the O
deregulation O
that O
's O
enshrined O
in O
the O
German B-MISC
constitution O
. O

Now O
we O
have O
to O
see O
how O
far O
we O
're O
going O
in O
the O
budget O

And O
you O
have O
to O
remember O
that O
the O
university O
world O
is O
a O
pretty O
small O
world O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
place O
where O
territorial O
integrity O
is O
quite O
important O
. O

But O
let O
's O
be O
clear O
that O

going O

Why O

And O
because O
the O

almost O

we O

This O
illustrates O
Frisch B-PER

rather O
somber O
view O

humanity O
: O
Unlike O
Brecht B-PER

whose O
epic O

clearly O
influenced O

the O

Yesterday O

So O
what O
went O
wrong O
? O

According O
to O
that O
press O

the O

was O
canceled O
for O
financial O

And O
next O

more O

Otherwise O

he B-LOC

We O

maybe O

He O

the O

The O
first O
BIN B-ORG
was O
launched O
in O
Poperinge B-LOC
six O
years O

at O
a O
time O

the O
Kappa B-ORG

a O
group O
of O
northern B-MISC
French I-MISC
people I-MISC
, O
were O
flooding O
primarily O
into O
sports O

more O
expensive O

But O
what O
can O
a O
BIN B-ORG
do O
if O
the O
police O
commissioner O
decides O
to O
put O
the O
report O
on O
his O
watch O

However O
, O
these O
were O
initiatives O
that O
were O
then O
heavily O
attacked O
from O
different O
angles O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
want O
better O
quality O
control O
of O
the O
projects O
and O
more O
support O
. O
" O

Various O
politicians O
thought O
that O
crime O

was O
an O
exclusive O
issue O
for O
the O

in O

from O

day O
work O
, O
we O
've O
noticed O
some O

The O

in O

will O
bring O

If O

the O

can O
travel O
at O
an O
average O

of O
six O
kilometers O
an O

faster O
, O
that O
's O
worth O
400 O

a O

Almost O

This O

Burn O

out O
is O
a O
word O
that O
does O
n't O
appear O
in O
their O
vocabulary O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

Symptomatic O
is O
that O
no O
more O
than O
six O
school O
dropouts O
, O
for O
all O
intents O

purposes O
, O
are O
on O

A O
beginner O

can O
build O
a O
lot O
of O
experience O
in O
this O
way O

because O
you O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
teach O

I O
'm O

convinced O
that O

we O
can O
bring O

But O
we O

General O

By O
the O
way O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
start O
with O
physical O
age O
, O
but O
we O
start O
with O
people O
who O
are O
mentally O
young O
, O
with O
a O
spirit O
and O
a O
curiosity O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
at O
some O
point O
find O
that O
on O
the O
level O
of O
musical O
baggage O
, O
their O
hard O
disk O
is O
full O
, O
and O
they O
want O
to O
carry O
that O
baggage O
with O
them O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
their O
lives O
. O

And O
anyone O
who O
looks O
out O
their O
necks O
has O
pros O
and O
cons O
. O

But O
it O
still O
cries O
every O
day O
, O
yes O
. O
" O

The O
last O
few O
years O
have O
been O
transitional O
years O
, O
but O
our O
current O
trajectory O
is O
particularly O
clear O
. O

It O
would O
be O
nonsensical O
to O
appoint O
new O

mimic O
the O
corypheans O
of O
10 O

afternoons O

we O
can O
sneak O
in O
people O
who O
are O
listening O
after O

50 B-MISC

Unlike O
before O

we O
package O
it O
much O

colorfully O

kindly O

The O

always O

Yet O

Symoens B-PER

Assertiveness O

: O
Role O

Students O
who O
are O
noisy O

should O

they O

The O
girls O
are O
just O
kept O
in O
the O
cold O
: O
they O
're O
taught O
subjects O
that O
do O
n't O
have O
much O

at O
all O
. O

There O

got O
to O
be O

in O

, O
for O
example O
. O

The O
reality O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
complex O
. O

Girls O
do O
better O
-- O
the O
statistics O
do O
n't O
lie O
-- O
but O
anyone O
who O
has O
the O
numbers O
in O
their O
heads O
and O
predicts O
a O
brighter O
future O
for O
girls O
is O
wrong O
. O

Because O
girls O
are O
still O
undervalued O
by O
their O
teachers O
, O
whether O
they O
're O
male O
or O
female O
. O

Girls O
choose O
to O
go O
to O
a O
lower O
level O
of O
education O
, O
where O
they O
do O
get O
better O
grades O
, O
but O
they O
're O
actually O
underperforming O
at O
that O
level O
. O

Also O
, O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
new O

a O

this O
problem O

And O
it O

the O

" O

With O

the O

Just O
like O
in O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
, O

have O
to O
be O

It O
even O

although O
that O

something O
that O

Symoens B-PER
: O
Teachers O

their O

into O
the O

. O

Very O
unconsciously O
, O
boys O
are O
undervalued O
, O
and O
girls O
are O
undervalued O
. O

That O
's O
why O
there O
's O
more O
boys O
dropping O
out O
and O
getting O
into O
this O
cascade O
, O
with O

as O

" O

Teachers O
are O
n't O
always O
aware O
of O
that O
, O
but O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
from O
the O
video O
that O
we O

Unconsciously O
or O
not O
, O
teachers O
are O
also O
trapped O
in O
a O
web O
of O
social O
stereotypes O

" O
Sometimes O
in O
society O
, O
it O
's O
appreciated O
that O
boys O
are O
taking O
the O
floor O
. O

Girls O
do O
better O
in O

than O

" O
For O

teachers O
should O
be O
able O
to O
use O

to O
analyze O
their O

behavior O

" O

According O
to O
Symoens B-PER

Sarens B-PER
, O
instead O
assertiveness O
is O
overrated O
in O
the O
German B-MISC

to O
the O

that O

there O

At O

, O
the O
Dutch B-MISC
ministers O

said O
that O
many O

still O
feel O
that O
drugs O
in O
their O
schools O
are O
not O
a O
topic O
that O
can O
be O
openly O
and O
freely O
discussed O
. O

It O
's O
only O
when O
a O
younger O
person O
's O
school O
performance O
is O
really O
compromised O
that O
it O
's O
important O
to O
have O
a O
few O
conversations O
with O
them O
. O

There O
are O
usually O
some O
enthusiastic O
or O
idealistic O
teachers O
or O
members O
of O
the O
staff O
who O
shrug O
it O
off O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
the O
VAD B-ORG
advises O
schools O
when O
there O
is O
a O
drug O
problem O
, O
" O
Try O
to O
understand O

, O
do O
n't O
act O
directly O
repressively O
, O
and O

" O

That O
problem O
is O
essentially O
the O
same O
with O

, O

The O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
that O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
positive O
effects O
could O
only O
occur O
after O
the O

already O
been O
purified O

Earlier O
, O
the O
WGO B-ORG
reported O
that O
the O
higher O
the O
tax O
on O
cigarettes O
, O
the O
more O
likely O
it O
was O
to O
affect O
smoking O
behavior O
. O

Despite O
the O
health O
warning O
, O
many O
smokers O
think O
that O
smoking O
light O
cigarettes O
is O
synonymous O
with O
smoking O
safely O
, O
and O
so O
they O
've O
switched O
to O
these O
cigarettes O
instead O
of O
quitting O
. O

Anno O
2000 O
: O
Every O
smoker O
knows O
that O
their O
cigarette O
is O
harmful O
to O
themselves O
and O
to O
their O
fellow O
smokers O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
said O
that O
this O
rise O
is O
primarily O
affecting O
younger O
smokers O
because O
they O
're O
more O
sensitive O
to O
the O
measures O
that O
are O
in O
their O
pockets O
. O

When O
smokers O
are O
no O
longer O
exposed O
to O
seductive O
tobacco O
images O
, O
the O
WHO B-ORG
estimates O
that O
overall O
tobacco O
consumption O
would O
decline O
by O
at O
least O
six O
percent O
. O

And O
on O
that O
consciousness O
, O
the O

are O
built O

Because O
of O
the O
ambiguous O
message O
that O
some O
packages O
carry O
, O
there O
's O
still O
some O
uncertainty O
as O
to O
whether O
this O
is O
going O
to O
have O
the O
right O

that O

even O
now O

as O
it O
pervades O

there O
are O
some O
observations O

In O
traditional O
education O
, O
everything O
is O
beautifully O
packaged O
in O

curriculum O
, O
but O
we O
also O
manage O
to O
deliver O
everything O
that O

" O

For O

if O

in O

the O
British B-MISC

called O

which O

the O

gradually O
gave O
birth O
to O
the O
image O
of O
a O
playful O

character O
, O
but O
also O
of O
a O
warhead O
who O
had O
a O
little O

practical O

Especially O
his O
quirky O
phrasing O
and O
his O
whimsical O

sophisticated O
way O
of O

is O
something O
that O
is O

The O
legacy O
of O
Tim B-PER
Buckley I-PER
, O
who O
, O
before O
he O
died O
of O
an O
overdose O
at O
the O
age O
of O
28 O
, O
left O
behind O
nine O
plates O
, O
would O
always O
be O
heavy O
on O
him O
. O

That O
's O
certainly O
a O
good O
reason O
to O
go O
see O
the O
movie O
. O

In O
an O
interview O
with O
an O
NRC B-ORG
trade I-ORG
paper I-ORG
, O
Fekovic B-PER
explained O
that O
Jeff B-PER
Buckley I-PER
, O
however O
, O
was O
mainly O
conditioned O
and O
kneaded O
by O
his O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
trying O
to O
make O
him O
a O
replacement O
for O
her O
running O
husband O
. O

Jeff B-PER
wanted O
to O
be O
different O
and O
better O
than O
his O
father O
, O
but O
the O
irony O
is O
that O
his O
career O
did O
n't O
really O
start O
until O
he O
had O
performed O
one O
of O
Tim B-MISC
's I-MISC
songs O
at O
a O
memorial O
service O
in O
New O
York O
City O
. O

Jasmina B-MISC
Fekovic I-MISC
's I-MISC
documentary O
also O
shows O
that O
Jeff B-PER
Buckley I-PER
dealt O
with O
the O
media O
in O
a O
more O
accountable O
way O
and O
dealt O
with O
himself O
in O
a O
much O
more O
personal O
way O
than O
is O
usually O
assumed O
. O

Jasmina B-PER
Fekovic I-PER
filmed O
both O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC

where O
Buckley B-PER

a O
long O
time O
, O
and O
in O
Memphis B-LOC
, O
where O
he O
spent O
his O
final O
days O
. O

According O
to O
the O
creator O
, O
however O
, O
the O
title O
refers O
primarily O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
her O
graduation O
project O
is O
both O
an O
introduction O
to O
and O
a O
farewell O
to O
the O

At O
the O
time O
of O
Luc B-PER

there O
was O
a O
much O
more O
open O
conversation O
about O
a O
lot O
of O
the O

" O

That O
's O
why O
I O

there O
was O
a O
clash O
with O
the O
Christian O
educational O

More O
cooperation O
between O

is O
absolutely O
necessary O

Not O
only O
were O

criticisms O

but O
your O

very O
negative O

But O
if O
there O
are O
34 O

in O
your O

, O
you O
've O
got O
a O
tough O
job O
. O
" O

The O
style O
needs O
to O
be O
changed O
urgently O
. O
" O

It O
's O
probably O
because O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
's O
become O
such O
a O
technical O
material O

And O
then O

" O
We O
urgently O
need O
to O
make O
a O
breakthrough O

But O
before O
we O
ever O
got O
together O
, O
the O
Christian O
trade O
unions O
had O
already O
signaled O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
pray O
. O

" O
But O
we O
ca O
n't O
really O
be O
concrete O
now O
, O
because O
in O
May O
we O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
there O
's O
no O
money O
now O
for O

" O
It O
turns O
out O
that O
everybody O

still O
attached O
to O
their O
political O
party O

to O
their O
seat O
, O
to O
their O
organization O

But O
if O
you O
go O
to O

and O
you O
hear O
the O

complaint O
every O
time O
, O
you O
know O
something O

going O
on O

What O
is O
the O
meaning O
of O
free O

and O
how O
are O
we O
going O
to O
fill O
it O
in O
the O

? O

I O
want O
to O
have O
that O
debate O
. O

Only O
a O
differentiated O
approach O
is O
a O
lot O
harder O
, O
because O
then O
you O
have O
to O
build O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
criteria O
. O

Only O
, O
if O
it O
goes O
wrong O
in O

, O
it O
will O
also O
go O
wrong O
in O

" O
And O
by O
the O
way O
, O
I O
ask O
myself O
questions O
when O
the O
trade O

say O
they O
represent O
the O
entire O
workforce O

On O
Wednesday O
, O
the O

informed O

not O
be O
possible O
if O
the O

did O
not O
blow O
up O
their O

That O
's O
going O
to O
be O
a O
tough O
discussion O
, O
but O
I O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
in O
a O
cool O
way O

How O
many O
hours O
does O
it O
take O
to O
perform O
? O

Is O
the O

're O
very O
excited O
about O

are O

The O

as O
an O

it O
can O
also O
be O
said O

This O
sporadic O

anyway O
remains O
a O
very O
temperamental O

that O

why O
it O
has O
to O
incorporate O

And O
finally O

let O

just O
say O
for O

good O

both O
