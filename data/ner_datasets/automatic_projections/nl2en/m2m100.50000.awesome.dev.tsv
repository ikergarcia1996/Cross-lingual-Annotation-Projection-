Every O

this O

That O

an O
important O

Generally O

Prime O

offered O
the O

a O
real O
state O
that O
would O
encompass O
virtually O
the O
entire O
West B-LOC

he O
came O
up O
with O

he O
offered O
Arafat B-PER

sovereignty O
over O
the O

find O
that O
this O

in O

The O

has O
already O
argued O
that O
in O

it O
is O
difficult O
to O
compensate O
for O
all O

That O

has O
found O
the O
general O
conditions O

of O
the O
NMBS B-ORG
contrary O

the O

The O

have O
instructed O
Robeyns B-PER

send O
a O

letter O
to O
the O
NMBS B-ORG
Ombudsman O
" O
at O
least O
once O
or O
twice O
" O
a O
week O
. O

That O
means O
waiting O
an O
hour O
in O
Bruges B-LOC
, O
so O
the O
journey O
will O
not O
take O
70 O
but O
130 O
minutes O

” O

During O
the O
peak O

it O
looks O
very O

Also O
, O
if O
a O

pays O
a O

the O

must O
pay O

if O
the O
first O

Consequently O
, O
two O

“ O

After O

The O
big O
culprit O
in O

is O
Dante B-PER
Brogno I-PER
, O
who O
offered O
his O

a O

that O

well O

at O
a O
time O
when O

The O
French B-MISC

“ O
That O

a O

says O
Wijnants B-PER

“ O
But O
if O
you O
ca O

find O

We O
did O
not O
ask O

Toni B-PER

if O
you O

that O
Standard B-ORG

that O

his O

” O

So O
there O
was O
suddenly O
Racing B-ORG

the O

Toni B-PER
Brogno I-PER
at O

earn O
24 O
