To O
which O
, O
the O
young O

, O
surpassed O
by O
his O
excellent O
ways O
and O
readiness O
to O
triumph O
, O
although O
other O
circumstances O
such O
as O
the O
sword O
prevented O
him O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
. O

Of O
all O
the O
developments O
on O
the O
wheel O
, O
the O
public O
followed O
with O
special O
attention O
those O
of O
Castaño B-PER
, O
for O
his O
dedication O
and O
boldness O
, O
for O
the O
concept O
of O
dancing O
he O
practices O
, O
curvy O
and O
increasingly O
towards O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
for O
that O
immeasurable O
passion O
that O
makes O
him O
permanently O
present O
in O
the O
field O
of O
dancing O
, O
where O
it O
seems O
impossible O
to O
walk O
. O

All O
in O
Castaño B-PER
is O
truth O
and O
emotion O
. O

That O
is O
why O
it O
is O
so O
interesting O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
will O
arrive O

The O

The O

had O
basically O
a O
lot O
of O

Very O
crossed O
and O
throwing O
the O
mule O
forward O
, O
Castaño B-PER
ran O
his O
hand O
very O
firmly O
to O
mark O
the O
long O
journey O
. O

Thus O
several O
times O
, O
take O
off O
the O
bride O
, O
templar O
and O
connect O
the O

, O
were O
the O
characteristics O
of O
the O

. O

When O
he O
left O
after O
a O

ending O
, O
losing O
his O
face O
to O
the O
animal O
, O
came O
a O
spectacular O
replay O
. O

More O
emotion O
in O
a O
final O
bernadinas O
. O

It O
was O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
sword O
was O
on O
the O
couch O
, O
because O
he O
had O
cut O
off O
an O
ear O
with O
all O
mercy O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
triumph O
was O
not O
expected O
in O
the O
following O
. O

Castaño B-PER
went O
out O
again O
with O
the O
cape O
. O

And O
the O
meal O
was O
very O
intense O
from O
beginning O
to O
end O
. O

This O
time O
it O
crossed O
its O
own O
border O
, O
rising O
even O
further O
beyond O
deception O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
place O
to O
spend O
time O
with O
my O
new O

. O

But O
, O
to O
the O
surprise O
of O
the O

ended O
up O
passing O

And O
Castaño B-PER
without O
changing O

The O
! O

¡ O
was O
confused O
with O
the O

. O

Faena O
not O
suitable O
for O

As O
an O
old O
magazine O
writer O
would O
say O
, O
the O
tile O
in O
the O
square O
was O
broken O
. O

Of O
course O
Castaño B-PER
is O
not O
just O
value O
. O

Because O
, O
to O
all O
this O
, O
did O
the O
dance O
of O
mule O
in O
advance O
, O
bring O
him O
fooled O
, O
passing O
him O
as O
close O
as O
he O
gets O
and O
taking O
him O
away O
. O

One O
behind O
the O
other O
and O
very O

What O

What O

with O
which O
he O
also O
made O
a O
good O
approach O
of O

, O
although O
he O
ended O
up O
screwing O
it O
with O
the O

. O

With O
the O
fourth O
, O
which O
remained O
cold O
on O
the O

, O
was O
not O
understood O
at O
all O
. O

Castella B-PER

once O
again O
confirmed O
what O
it O
already O
demonstrated O
in O
this O
same O
place O
in O
its O
debut O

it O
expects O

already O
been O
accepted O

ETA B-ORG
has O
rejected O
this O

the O

continue O

violent O

are O
not O

economic O

the O

that O
" O

it O
is O
necessary O

clarify O
the O

properly O
" O
, O
the O

the O
" O

" O
to O
promote O

legitimately O
develop O
relations O

statement O
criticizes O
the O

. O

This O
letter O
increases O
its O
criticism O
of O
the O

This O

Venezuelans O
, O
according O
to O

, O
understand O
that O

, O
and O
assume O
that O
Arias B-PER

more O
committed O
to O
building O
a O
solid O
economy O

In O
this O
scenario O
, O
the O
intention O

that O

for O

" O
the O

Boehm B-PER

underlined O
that O
the O
discrimination O
that O
he O
believes O
the O

that O
it O

that O

depend O
on O

behaviour O
of O

In O
the O

the O

be O
a O

of O

) O
over O
the O

expected O

. O

For O
Cárdenas B-PER
, O
the O
agreement O
is O
supported O
more O
than O
by O
controls O
on O
the O
need O
for O
coffee O
- O
producing O
nations O
to O
improve O
the O
external O
price O
, O
whose O
quotation O
undermines O
this O
activity O
because O
the O
current O
price O
does O
not O
even O
compensate O
for O

The O

The O

even O

below O
the O
current O

of O

, O
the O
Colombian O

said O
. O

According O
to O
the O
source O
, O
the O
decrease O
in O
the O

will O
mean O
an O
accumulation O
of O

in O
the O
producer O
countries O
of O
about O
18 O
nine O
million O

in O

. O

It O
is O
estimated O
by O
the O
Colombian O
coffee O

authorities O
that O
non O

producing O
consumer O
countries O
have O
inventories O
of O
between O
13 O

, O
which O
would O
increase O
to O
18 O

19 O
million O
if O
no O

made O
. O

Cárdenas B-PER
said O
that O
the O

expected O
to O
reduce O

in O
these O
countries O
to O
8 O
or O
9 O

For O
the O
spokesman O
of O
Colombian O

the O
fact O
that O
Brazil B-LOC

among O
the O
first O
to O
apply O

be O
made O

insofar O

they O
withdraw O

, O
will O
show O
the O

The O

that O

lawsuit O
fell O

In O

to O
that O

, O
he O
added O
, O
the O

is O
committed O
to O
paying O
about O

245,000 O

in O
contracts O

Johnson B-PER

where O
the O

conducted O
by O
half O
a O
million O
smokers O
in O
the O
state O
of O
Florida B-LOC
. O

According O
to O
the O
lawyer O
, O
it O
is O
" O
unrealistic O
" O
to O
think O
that O
tobacco O
companies O
can O
pay O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
in O
compensation O
to O
smokers O
and O
in O
the O
specific O

the O

that O

fell O

36 O

A O
judge O
ruled O
last O

that O
smoking O
caused O
cancer O
to O
three O
Florida B-LOC
smokers O
, O
and O
awarded O
them O
$ O
12.6 O
million O

compensation O
. O

The O
verdict O
left O
the O
door O
open O
for O
the O
remaining O
half O
- O
million O
smokers O
claiming O
to O
be O
heard O
in O
court O
and O
receive O
compensation O
that O
tobacco O
companies O
fear O
will O
amount O
to O
some O
$ O
300,000 O
million O
. O

The O
same O
judge O
ruled O
in O
1999 O
that O
tobacco O
companies O
were O
responsible O
for O
cigarette O
- O
related O
diseases O
by O
manufacturing O
a O
defective O
product O
that O
causes O
inflammation O
and O
lung O
cancer O
, O
among O
other O
diseases O
. O

According O
to O
analysts O
, O
the O
judge O
's O
ruling O
could O
lead O
the O
US O
tobacco O

to O
declare O
bankruptcy O

the O

Fearing O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
trial O
, O
Florida B-LOC
legislators O
recently O

passed O
a O
law O
that O
will O

, O

about O
$ O
11.300 O

had O
for O

. O

Part O

, O

was O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party O
: O

Peruvian O
Prime O
Minister O
Alberto B-PER
Bustamante I-PER
said O
today O
that O
it O
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
government B-ORG
to O
decide O
on O
the O
postponement O
of O
the O
date O
for O
the O
second O
round O
of O
elections O
, O
which O
is O
scheduled O
for O
28 O
May O
next O
. O

Bustamante B-PER
said O
it O
is O
a O
matter O
that O
depends O
on O
the O
National B-ORG
Elections I-ORG
Judge I-ORG
( O
JNE B-ORG
) O
or O
the O
Congress B-ORG
, O
which O
could O
pass O
a O

it O

, O
he O

" O
in O

" O
. O

The O
postponement O
of O
the O
second O
round O
to O
June O

was O
requested O
to O
the O
JNE B-ORG
by O
the O
opposition O
presidential O
candidate O
, O
Alejandro B-PER
Toledo I-PER
, O
last O
week O
, O
but O
his O
request O
, O
based O
on O
that O
there O
is O
no O
time O
to O
correct O
irregularities O
recorded O
in O
the O
process O
since O
the O
elections O
of O
April O
9 O
last O
, O
was O
rejected O
by O
the O
electoral O
body O
. O

Toledo B-PER
announced O
last O
Monday O
to O
the O
Electoral O
Judge B-ORG
that O
it O
will O
not O
participate O
in O
the O
second O
round O
if O
it O
takes O
place O
next O
Sunday O
. O

All O
the O
national O
and O
international O
election O
observation O
missions O
acting O
in O
the O
process O
, O
have O
raised O
in O
their O
reports O
the O
postponement O
of O
the O
elections O
for O
the O
same O
reasons O
and O
considering O
that O
the O
second O
round O
does O
not O
meet O
the O
minimum O
conditions O
for O
being O
considered O
clean O
, O
fair O
and O
democratic O
. O

Bustamante B-PER
pointed O
out O
today O
in O
statements O
to O
the O
press O
that O
the O
National B-ORG
Elections I-ORG
Judge I-ORG
had O
already O
spoken O
on O
the O
matter O
and O
rejected O
Toledo B-PER
's O
request O
for O
postponement O
. O

He O
noted O
, O
however O
, O
that O
it O
was O
" O
a O
possibility O
" O
for O
the O
JNE B-ORG
to O
change O
its O
opinion O
. O

The O
Prime O
Minister O
ruled O
out O
that O
a O
" O
political O
exit O
" O
could O
be O
given O
to O
the O
problem O
, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
analysts O
, O
has O
triggered O
a O
crisis O
in O
Peru B-LOC
. O

" O
A O
political O
exit O
must O
always O
be O
given O
within O
the O
context O
of O
the O
applicable O
regulations O
. O

In O
this O
case O
we O
have O
Article O
111 O
of O
the O
Constitution B-MISC
which O
clearly O
speaks O
of O
30 O
days O
after O
the O
delivery O
of O
the O
stamps O
and O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
when O
this O
Article O
111 O
is O
found O
within O
the O
chapter O
of O
the O
executive O
power B-MISC
can O
not O
be O
interpreted O
as O
wishfully O
intended O
to O
do O
so O
" O
, O
argued O
. O

According O
to O
the O
interpretation O
of O
Bustamante B-PER
, O
which O
has O
been O
the O
criterion O
applied O
by O
the O
JNE B-ORG
, O
the O
official O
result O
of O
the O
presidential O
vote O
held O
at O
the O
end O
of O
last O
month O
was O
the O
end O
of O
the O
electoral O
process O
in O
this O
respect O
. O

The O
electoral O
law O
stipulates O
that O
the O
second O
round O
of O
the O
country O
's O
presidency O
, O
when O
none O
of O
the O
candidates O
has O
obtained O
half O
plus O
one O
vote O
, O
must O
be O
held O
within O
30 O
days O
after O
the O
proclamation O
of O
the O
official O
results O
. O

The O
other O
interpretation O
of O
the O
law O
, O
which O
was O
the O
argument O
presented O
by O
Toledo B-PER
to O
the O
JNE B-ORG
to O
request O
postponement O
, O
considers O
that O
the O
process O
of O
general O
elections O
- O
presidential O
and O
legislative O
- O
is O
one O
and O
ends O
only O
when O
the O
total O
results O
are O
given O
, O
for O
the O
presidency O
and O
Congress B-ORG
, O
which O
, O
he O
said O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
occurred O
. O

Bustamante B-PER
reiterated O
that O
this O
argument O
was O
not O
valid O
and O
that O
the O
date O
from O
which O
the O
results O
of O
the O
presidential O
count O
were O
delivered O
should O
be O
counted O
. O

for O
a O

seemed O

to O

the O
last O

of O
the O

play O

off O

because O
the O
third O

vanished O
by O

Madrid B-ORG
will O
play O
the O
final O
against O

with O
the O
tranquility O
of O
knowing O
that O
, O
at O
least O
, O

already O
secured O
a O
place O
in O
the O
next O
Euroliga B-MISC
. O

However O
, O
it O
will O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
forget O
the O
fifth O
game O
of O
this O
semi O

chess O
. O

The O
classification O
was O
white O
at O
eleven O
minutes O
from O

The O
twelve O

that O
the O
Scariolo B-PER
team O
had O
stored O
thanks O
to O
Eric B-PER

promising O
a O
black O
future O
for O

( O

Suddenly O
, O
from O
the O
student O
bench O
jumped O
to O
the O
track O
César B-PER
Arranz I-PER
, O
who O
has O
barely O
crossed O
the O
track O
this O

, O
and O
the O
shock O
gave O
a O
return O
. O

The O
Pivot O
of'Estu'entered B-ORG
the O

below O
the O

and O
set O
foot O
for O
Madrid B-ORG
, O
which O
began O
to O
tie O
triples O
and O
lose O
margin O
in O
the O

. O

When O
he O
wanted O
to O
realize O
, O
the O
Student B-ORG
was O
again O
in O
the O
breach O
( O

. O

Fortunately O
for O
the O
Madriders O
, O
the O
college O
defence O
was O
wrong O
in O
a O
key O
game O
that O
allowed O
Alberto B-PER
Angulo I-PER
to O
throw O
from O
6.25 O
( O
69 O
- O
64 O
) O
. O

That O
breath O
saved O
Madrid B-ORG
from O
the O
plague O
and O
condemned O
the O
winners O
of O
the O
King O

Two O
free O
shots O
from O

and O
a O
triple O
base O
lifted O
the O
win O
to O
a O
marker O
that O
, O
shortly O
before O
, O
was O
unquestionable O
dominion O
of O
the O
locals O

the O

He O
missed O
the O
first O

, O
but O
scored O
the O
second O
. O

The O
agony O
was O
palpable O
everywhere O
and O
Juan B-PER
Aisa I-PER
started O
the O
race O
towards O
the O
road O
of O

He O
jumped O
three O
men O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
field O
, O
put O
on O
a O
side O
and O
, O
when O
no O
one O
expected O
him O
, O
took O
a O
pass O
that O
left O
only O
Thompson B-PER
under O
the O
ring O
. O

The O
American O
could O
even O
beat O
, O
but O
left O
a O
hurried O
band O
and O
the O
ball O
came O
out O

RESULTS O
After O
the O
apoteosis O
of O
Sunday O
in O
this O
same O
square O
and O
given O
the O
category O
of O
the O
card O
, O
everything O
indicated O
that O
the O
evening O
was O
going O
to O
pass O
also O
by O
good O
derroteros O
. O

But O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case O
for O
the O
peasants O
on O
foot O
. O

Neither O
" O
Antoñete B-PER
" O
nor O
Curro B-PER
found O
moments O
of O
inspiration O
except O
some O
passages O
through O
the O
genius O
that O
took O
the O
toys O
from O
Arjona B-PER
. O

Thus O
the O
only O
trophy O
was O
to O
stop O
the O
rejuvenator O
Pablo B-PER
Hermoso I-PER
de I-PER
Mendoza I-PER
who O
had O
moments O
of O
brilliant O
in O
his O
two O
teeth O
, O
although O
clawed O
more O
ceretro O
in O
his O
second O
, O
a O
manso O
and O
aquerenciado O
in O
tables O
, O
with O
which O
he O
exhibited O
climbing O
to O
" O
Cagancho B-MISC
" O
. O

This O
time O
he O
also O
killed O
the O
ear O
of O
the O
first O
one O
there O
. O

" O
Antoñete B-PER
" O
had O
a O
first O
good O
toro O
, O
to O
which O
he O
received O
with O
a O
ramillete O
of O
good O
Veronicas O
and O
then O
highlighted O
two O
series O
one O
on O
the O
right O
and O
another O
to O
the O
natural O
of O
great O
quality O
and O
plasticity O
. O

However O
, O
the O
possible O
trophy O
did O
not O
come O
because O
of O
his O
misuse O
of O
the O
sword O
. O

The O
fifth O
took O
more O
genius O
and O
caste O
and O
did O
not O
find O
matching O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
pup O
was O
injured O
when O
entering O
to O
kill O
and O
went O
through O
a O
cough O
to O
finish O
the O
stain O
. O

Also O
in O
the O
greeting O
to O
his O
first O
, O
Curro B-PER
Romero I-PER
highlighted O
for O
his O
release O
of O
arms O
and O
master O
's O
to O
interpret O
the O
dance O
to O
the O
violin O
. O

But O
it O
was O
all O
, O
because O
equally O
the O
genius O
of O
his O
opponent O
made O
him O
open O
without O
more O
. O

Something O
similar O
to O
his O
second O
, O
which O
received O
a O
severe O
punishment O
in O
the O
barrels O
. O

He O
tried O
it O
, O
although O
again O
without O
reaching O
to O
structure O
faena O
when O
he O
saw O
that O
it O
was O
not O
suitable O
for O
the O
hunting O
, O
decided O
to O
kill O
him O

positive O
aspects O

the O
recent O
creation O

the O
problems O

the O
negative O
aspects O

must O
continue O

little O

it O

that O

The O

that O
today O
happened O
the O
opposite O

and O
that O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
these O
sudden O
movements O
are O
due O
to O
the O
low O
volume O
of O
business O
, O
so O
a O
combination O
of O
operations O
not O
that O
would O
not O
be O
too O
important O
on O
a O
day O
with O
a O
strong O
volume O
, O
allow O
the O
market O
to O
vary O
direction O
. O

Although O
for O
some O
analysts O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
market O
shows O
very O
low O
levels O
of O
business O
should O
partly O
alleviate O
investors O
' O
fears O
( O
because O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
lows O
of O
recent O
days O
are O
not O
too O
representative O
) O
, O
others O
believe O
that O
anyway O
, O
with O
high O
or O
low O
volume O
of O
business O
, O
lows O
of O
today O
's O
magnitude O
are O
always O
a O
source O
of O
concern O
. O

According O
to O
experts O
, O
investors O
are O
still O
very O
concerned O
about O
the O
future O
of O
interest O
rates O
after O
the O
midpoint O
rise O
decreed O
last O

by O
the O
Federal B-ORG

. O

It O
is O
feared O
that O
new O
rate O
increases O
( O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
authorities O
) O
may O
affect O
the O
profits O
of O
companies O
, O
and O
in O

Experts O
agree O
that O

the O

that O

in O

" O

to O
the O
great O

of O

. O

A O
Roberto B-PER
Baggio I-PER
who O
, O
curiously O
, O
in O
which O
it O
may O
have O
been O
his O
last O
game O
as O
an O
entertainer O
, O
has O
saved O
the O
Milan B-ORG
Inter I-ORG
economically O
, O
has O
stopped O
a O
" O
revolution O
" O
planned O
within O
him O
of O
having O

and O
has O
also O
saved O
the O
head O
of O
the O
technician O
Marcello B-PER
Lippi I-PER
with O
whom O
throughout O
the O
season O
has O
maintained O
great O
controversy O
. O

But O
today O
Roberto B-PER
Baggio I-PER
has O
taken O
his O
particular O
revenge O
, O
demonstrating O
that O
in O
a O
football O
where O
the O
physical O
, O
genius O
, O
technique O
, O
when O
they O
decide O
to O
put O
it O
on O
the O
field O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
decisive O
. O

He O
did O
so O
with O
an O
unbalanced O
performance O
and O
with O
two O
goals O
worthy O
of O
his O
quality O
: O
the O
first O
( O
m.36 O
) O
, O
in O
bag O
of O
direct O
lateral O
missing O
, O
passing O
the O
ball O
in O
the O
upper O
right O
corner O
, O
considering O
that O
all O
, O
including O
the O
Buffon B-PER
goal O
, O
were O
waiting O
for O
the O
center O
; O
the O
second O
( O
m.83 O

, O
in O
excellent O
midfield O
volley O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
area O
with O
the O
left O
leg O
, O
his O
theoretically O
" O
bad O
" O
. O

The O
game O
had O
had O
a O
balanced O
start O
, O
played O
in O
a O
few O
central O
meters O
by O
the O
strong O
pressure O
exerted O
by O
both O
sides O
. O

From O
the O
minute O
twenty O
, O
the O
Inter B-ORG
had O
a O
greater O
presence O
, O
also O
benefited O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
Yugovic B-PER
who O
gave O
order O
and O
tranquility O
. O

However O
, O
the O
first O
great O
occasion O
was O
the O
Parma B-ORG
, O
with O
Dino B-PER
Baggio I-PER
sending O
a O
ball O
to O
the O
ball O
( O

The O

did O
not O
get O
it O
, O
but O
yes O
nine O
minutes O
later O
the O

, O
with O
the O
excellent O
and O

With O
a O
lost O
Parma B-ORG
, O
which O
finished O
without O
order O
or O
ideas O
, O
and O
an O
Inter B-ORG
that O
controlled O
, O
however O
, O
Mario B-PER
Stanic I-PER
( O
m.70 O
) O
came O
close O
to O
winning O
in O
punch O
of O
the O
head O
in O
corner O
sack O
. O

Now O
it O
was O
the O
Parma B-ORG
who O
went O
to O
dominate O
and O
arranged O
the O
great O
opportunity O
to O
advance O
in O
shooting O
Stanic B-PER
( O
m.76 O
) O
who O
was O
for O
a O
while O
. O

But O
a O
new O
genius O
of O
Roberto B-PER
Baggio I-PER
put O
forward O
the O
Inter B-ORG
and O
everything O
was O
already O

because O

not O
