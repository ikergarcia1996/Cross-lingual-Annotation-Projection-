" O
From O

we O
knew O
that O

not O

that O

" O
Almost O
all O

benefit O
after O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party O
: O

The O
Spanish B-ORG
team O
has O
made O
the O
first O
training O
this O
morning O
in O
the O

that O
began O
yesterday O
Monday O

Manga I-ORG
Club I-ORG
complex O
, O
located O

the O
final O

of O
the O
King O

Cup I-MISC
that O
will O
be O
played O
next O

The O
meeting O
of O
the O
Bangladesh O

was O
extended O
for O
two O
hours O
and O
in O
it O
the O
coach O
, O
Paco B-PER
Flores I-PER
, O
arranged O
an O
eminently O
physical O
work O
, O
although O
the O
players O
also O
played O
ball O
. O

The O
main O
novelty O
of O
the O
day O
was O
, O
precisely O
, O
the O
use O
of O
the O
sphere O
that O
will O
be O
used O
in O
the O
forthcoming O
Eurocup B-MISC
of O
Belgium B-LOC
and O
the O

The O

the O
final O
of O
the O
King O

After O
the O
training O
, O
Flores B-PER
himself O
spoke O
about O
the O
characteristics O
of O
the O
new O
ball O
and O
said O
that O
" O
it O
is O
completely O
different O
to O
what O
is O
used O
in O
the O
league B-MISC
. O

With O
it O
you O
actually O
win O
, O
but O
you O
lose O
in O
speed O
" O
. O

" O
In O
any O
case O
, O
my O
team O
, O
like O
Atlético B-ORG
, O
has O
a O
week O
to O
adapt O
to O
it O
and O
we O
have O
to O
get O
used O
to O
its O
use O
in O
that O
short O
period O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

Referring O
to O
the O
place O
of O
concentration O
, O
the O
Prince B-LOC
Felipe I-LOC
hotel I-LOC
and O
its O
surroundings O
, O
Flores B-PER
said O
that O
" O
it O
is O
a O
wonderful O
and O
ideal O
place O
to O
prepare O
a O
game O
of O
calibre O
that O
will O
have O
the O
one O
to O
be O
contested O
on O
Saturday O
" O
. O

The O
Spanish O
technician O
also O
referred O
to O
the O
fall O
of O
defence O
Toni B-PER
Soldevila I-PER
, O
injured O
last O
Friday O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
have O
to O
accept O
that O
we O
can O
not O
count O
on O
him O
and O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
want O
for O
him O
at O
this O
moment O
is O
to O
improve O
his O
injury O
in O
the O
shortest O
possible O
time O
. O

That O
is O
why O
he O
stayed O
in O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
because O
there O
we O
have O
sufficient O
means O
for O
his O
recovery O
: O
laser O
equipment O
, O
radar O
and O
ultrasound O
" O
. O

The O
team O
will O
return O
to O
work O
tomorrow O
morning O
in O
the O
football O
center O
of O
the O
La B-LOC
Manga I-LOC
Club I-LOC
complex O
, O
while O
the O
afternoons O
are O
directed O
to O
the O
recovery O
of O
the O
footballers O
, O
according O
to O
Carlos B-PER
Lorenzano I-PER
, O
physical O
trainer O
of O
the O
club O
. O

On O
the O
work O
scheduled O
for O
the O
next O
few O
days O
, O
Flores B-PER
said O
: O
" O
With O
him O
we O
will O
try O
to O
win O
at O
speed O
, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
virtues O
this O
team O
has O
. O

We O
are O
also O
going O
to O
study O
at O
Atlético B-ORG
de I-ORG
Madrid I-ORG
, O
who O
in O
his O
last O
visits O
to O
Oviedo B-LOC
and O
Palma B-LOC
de I-LOC
Mallorca I-LOC
has O
experienced O
a O
significant O
improvement O
in O
his O
game O
. O

Whenever O
a O
team O
changes O
coach O
, O
it O
tends O
to O
increase O
their O
performance O
and O
, O
respecting O
Antic B-PER
, O
I O
think O
Atlético B-ORG
is O
benefiting O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
Zambrano B-PER
. O
" O

Flores B-PER
thinks O
that O
the O
spanish O
team O
's O
concentration O
is O
favourable O
to O
avoid O
the O
" O
euphoria O
" O
that O
has O
been O
brought O
about O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
blanquiazul O
team O
in O
the O
final O
copera O
. O

" O
Being O
distant O
from O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
the O
feeling O
of O
euphoria O
is O
also O
distant O
. O

I O
try O
not O
to O
read O
the O
press O
and O
I O
prefer O
my O
players O
not O
to O
do O
so O
either O
to O
avoid O
being O
contagious O
with O
the O
sensations O
that O
are O
out O
there O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
I O
will O
try O
to O
put O
all O
the O
pressure O
on O
me O
and O
not O
on O
my O
players O
, O
because O
then O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
show O
the O
football O
they O
carry O
inside O
, O
" O
Flores B-PER
explained O
. O

He O
also O
acknowledged O
: O
" O
What O
I O
am O
most O
interested O
in O
is O
to O
motivate O
the O
eleven O
who O
leave O
the O
field O
to O
play O
against O
Atlético B-ORG
, O
because O
they O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
are O
going O
to O
give O
us O
food O
. O

I O
want O
everyone O
to O
understand O
the O
difficulty O
of O
being O
in O
line O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
want O
to O
be O
highly O
valued O
what O
it O
costs O
to O
be O
a O
holder O
and O
those O
who O
are O
to O
adhere O
to O
that O
condition O
not O
to O
abandon O
it O
" O
. O

The O
manager O
of O
Espanyol B-ORG
stated O
: O
" O
always O
opposed O
by O
my O
team O
and O
poor O
coach O
who O
does O
n't O
do O
it O
, O
because O
he O
will O
have O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
game O
lost O
" O
and O
stressed O
that O
" O
between O
my O
team O
and O
Atlético B-ORG
there O
are O
no O
differences O
in O
the O
physical O
aspect O
, O
although O
maybe O
I O
know O
there O
are O
in O
the O
psychological O

The O

investigating O
an O

had O
chosen O

The O
authorities O

the O
establishment O
alerted O
the O
Police B-ORG

which O
had O
to O
pursue O
the O
buyer O
because O

warning O
the O

of O
officers O
, O
who O
managed O
to O
stop O
him O
down O
a O
few O
streets O
when O
he O
threw O
a O
bag O
inside O
a O
glass O
container O
. O

The O
police B-ORG
intercepted O
three O
gold O
cards O
from O
United B-ORG
Overseas I-ORG

Public B-ORG
banks O

in O
which O

was O
a O

also O
holding O
the O

that O
the O

Days O
after O
his O
arrest O
, O
a O
fourth O

also O
counterfeited O

Following O
initial O
investigations O
, O
the O

that O
the O

" O

Some O

If O
I O
were O
an O

The O

It O
is O
feared O
that O
new O

may O

In O
yesterday O

this O
fear O
caused O
a O
very O
strong O

for O

the O
whole O
day O
, O
but O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
a O
low O

price O
shopping O

prevented O
a O
large O

downturn O
. O

In O
today O

, O
the O

moved O
between O

the O
certain O
optimism O
generated O
by O
yesterday O

. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
general O
characteristic O
of O
the O
market O
is O
the O
real O
" O
quiet O
" O
of O

, O
who O
do O

71 O

Furthermore O
, O
he O
criticized O
the O
repetition O
of O

, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
one O
at O
the O

, O
as O

the O
absence O
of O

He O
stressed O
that O
degrees O
are O
no O
more O
expensive O
in O

while O
he O
described O
as O
" O
incorrect O

" O
the O
assessment O
of O
the O
costs O
of O
each O

student O
, O
collected O
in O
the O
economic O
memory O
of O

According O
to O
Chamorro B-PER
, O
the O
university O
schools O
on O
the O
campus O
aspire O
to O
incorporate O
secondary O
cycles O
and O
the O
delay O
in O
achieving O
this O
goal O
generates O
great O
frustration O
between O

For O
his O
part O
, O
Floris B-PER
expressed O
the O
desire O
of O
the O
Oscense O
campus O
to O
" O
integrate O
" O
into O
the O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG

, O
although O
he O
considered O
that O
the O

of O

operate O
as O
" O
delegated O
academies O
of O
the O
Zaragoza B-LOC

" O
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
teachers O
in O
Huesca B-LOC
have O
an O
average O
age O
below O
that O
of O
the O
Zaragoza B-LOC

added O
that O
some O

live O
in O
Huesca B-LOC

while O
others O
have O

both O
in O
Huesca B-LOC

The O

he O
added O
, O
do O
not O
perceive O
the O
same O
services O
as O
in O
the O
Aragón O
capital O
, O
because O
the O
infrastructure O
is O
inadequate O

some O

the O

Roberto B-PER
Dueñas I-PER
, O
Pivot O
from O

continues O
without O
improving O
from O
the O

injury O
that O
significantly O
lost O
his O
participation O
in O
the O
semifinals O
of O
the O
ACB B-MISC
in O
which O
his O
team O
faced O
Tau B-ORG
, O
only O
three O
days O
from O
the O
first O
match O
of O
the O
final O
. O

Dueñas B-PER
' O
physical O
situation O
is O
the O
same O
at O
the O
moment O
as O
during O
the O
series O
against O
the O
team O
of O
Julio B-PER
Lamas I-PER
, O
as O
the O
solution O
to O
the O
problem O
only O
goes O
through O
a O
long O
period O
of O
rest O
that O
neither O
the O
club O

the O

can O
afford O
at O
the O
moment O

Despite O
the O
injury O
, O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
pill O
at O
the O
end O
is O
guaranteed O
and O
, O
even O
, O
it O
is O
not O
ruled O
out O
that O
you O
have O
a O
favorable O
evolution O

in O
the O
next O
three O

against O

In O
addition O
, O
Alston B-PER

has O
been O
more O
positive O
than O
that O

has O
improved O
since O
they O
finished O
the O

of O

However O
, O
neither O
will O
be O
able O
to O
offer O
their O
best O
performance O
in O

Health I-ORG
Committee I-ORG

Matilde B-MISC
Valentine I-MISC

has O
today O
asked O
the O

for O
detailed O
information O
on O
waiting O
lists O
in O
Insalud B-ORG
, O
both O

in O

Valentine B-PER
pointed O
out O
to O
Efe B-ORG
that O
in O
his O
request O
he O
included O
data O
by O
autonomous O

, O
as O
well O
as O
its O
breakdown O
by O

It O
also O
requests O
information O
on O
maximum O

because O
, O
he O
said O
, O
data O
on O
average O
delays O
do O
not O
serve O
to O
know O
exactly O
how O
long O
each O
person O
expects O
. O

The O
Socialist O
MEP O
explained O
that O
she O
had O
made O
this O
request O
in O
view O
of O
the O
statements O
made O
yesterday O
by O
the O
Minister O
for O
Health B-MISC
, O
Celia B-PER
Villalobos I-PER
, O
who O
said O
that O
the O
data O
relating O

were O
not O
an O
interesting O
issue O
. O

Valentine B-PER
has O
also O
put O
a O
question O
to O
the O
Executive B-ORG
for O
inclusion O
in O
the O
monitoring O

on O
Wednesday O
31 O
May O
on O
the O

the O
Government B-ORG
envisages O
to O
address O
the O
problem O
of O
waiting O

. O

For O
the O
Socialist O
spokeswoman O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
a O
working O
group O
has O
been O
set O
up O
to O
tackle O
this O
problem O
demonstrates O
that O
' O
the O
excellence O
in O
reducing O
waiting O
lists O
that O
the O
former O
Health B-MISC
Minister O
, O
José B-PER
Manuel I-PER
Romay I-PER
, O
spoke O
of O
was O
not O
true O
' O
. O

According O
to O
Valentine B-PER
, O
the O
parameters O
that O
Health B-MISC
uses O
to O
provide O
data O
on O
waiting O
lists O
, O
with O
concepts O
such O
as O
the O
average O
delay O
, O
should O
be O
changed O
, O
while O
arguing O
for O
a O
comprehensive O
analysis O
of O
the O
reasons O
for O
delays O
in O
each O
service O

Another O
of O
the O
proposals O
put O
forward O
by O
the O

was O
the O
opening O
of O

, O
Valentine B-PER

that O
the O

added O
that O

said O
today O
in O
a O
statement O
that O
the O
policy O
followed O
by O
the O

on O
waiting O

has O
so O
far O
been O
characterized O
by O
the O
" O
systematic O
makeup O
of O
them O
" O
and O
by O
the O
indiscriminate O
assessment O
of O

for O

people O
who O
are O
on O

without O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
severity O
of O
the O

For O
the O
FADSP B-ORG
, O
it O
is O
not O
so O
much O
a O
question O
of O
decommissioning O
waiting O
lists O
, O
but O
of O
making O
them O
rational O
, O

not O
excessive O

tailored O

Guillermo B-PER
Fortún I-PER
admitted O
today O
the O
possibility O
of O

in O

areas O
in O

of O
the O

. O

During O
a O
meeting O
with O
international O

, O
Fortún B-PER
referred O
to O
the O
one O
- O

deadline O
given O
by O

' O

in O
Chapare B-LOC
, O
where O
Bolivia B-LOC
grows O
the O
largest O
amount O
of O
cocaine O
, O
for O
the O
authorities O
to O
cancel O
the O
cocaine O
eradication O
programme O
. O

The O
Bolivian O
minister O
claimed O
that O
the O
plan O
to O
eliminate O
illegal O
coca O
plantations O
, O
initiated O
in O
1997 O
, O
would O
not O
be O
modified O
and O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
government B-ORG
expects O
that O
in O
December O

the O
slogan O
of O
" O
zero B-MISC

launched O
by O

Hugo B-PER
Banzer I-PER
. O

At O
an O
assembly O
last O
weekend O
, O
the O
farmers O
of O
Chapare B-LOC
demanded O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
destruction O
of O
coca O
that O
the O
government B-ORG
considers O
illegal O
, O
demanded O
more O
resources O
for O
alternative O
development O
plans O
and O
demanded O
an O
end O
to O
the O
human O
rights O
violations O
of O
that O
population O
. O

Minister O
Fortun B-PER
assured O
that O
the O
government B-ORG
is O
ready O
to O
dialogue O
with O
the O
farmers O
and O
announced O
the O
start O
of O

government B-ORG
and O
the O
Union O

of I-ORG
Bolivia I-ORG
, O
agreed O
when O
the O
state O
of O
play O
was O
ended O
last O
month O
. O

However O
, O
it O
acknowledged O
that O
the O
eradication O
of O
illegal O
coca O
cultivation O
can O
cause O
effects O
of O
unemployment O
and O
poverty O
at O
higher O
rates O
than O
Bolivia B-LOC
currently O
suffers O
and O
" O
if O
there O
are O
no O
alternatives O
in O
the O
coming O
years O
there O
could O
be O
problems O
" O
of O
social O
violence O
. O

According O
to O
him O
, O
the O
control O
of O
the O
coca O
leaf O
trade O
and O
the O
promulgation O
of O
a O
new O
Customs B-MISC
Act I-MISC
, O
which O
combats O
smuggling O
at O
the O

, O
are O
the O
causes O
of O
the O
greatest O
social O
unrest O
since O
the O
end O
of O
last O

. O

This O
situation O
" O
must O
recognize O
the O
countries O
( O
foreigners O
) O
to O
help O
Bolivia B-LOC
and O
find O
a O
way O
to O
suppress O
" O
the O
resources O
that O
stops O
entering O
the O
country O
by O
cocaine O

and O
that O
are O
calculated O
at O
around O
8 O
per O

of O
Gross O
Domestic B-MISC

until O
1995 O
, O
said O
the O
minister O
. O

Fortún B-PER
noted O
that O
Bolivia B-LOC
is O
paying O
a O
high O
price O
in O
the O
fight O
against O
drug O
trafficking O
, O
such O
as O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
use O
of O
prohibited O
drugs O
among O
its O
youth O
population O
, O
but O
clarified O
that O
it O
has O
not O
been O
the O
same O
as O
other O
countries O
where O
social O
violence O
has O
occurred O
in O
the O
guerrilla O
. O

According O
to O
government O
estimates O
, O
the O
Joint O
Task O
Force B-ORG
is O
lacking O
to O
eradicate O
5,100 O
hectares O
of O
illegal O
coca O
cultivation O
, O
in O
plantations O
that O

now O
located O
in O
remote O
locations O
. O

The O
Minister B-PER
of I-PER
Government I-PER
said O
that O
these O
crops O
are O
defended O
by O
the O
farmers O
' O
unions O
with O
" O
a O
political O
speech O
of O
protection O
against O
criminal O
acts O
and O
that O
he O
wants O
to O
lead O
us O
to O
confrontation O

with O
the O

that O

In O
his O
review O

Fortún B-PER
specified O
his O
optimism O
that O
Bolivia B-LOC
" O
will O
not O
suffer O
great O
problems O
" O
in O

Doctor O
Philippe B-PER

told O

that O
the O
cities O
in O

have O
been O
recorded O
are O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
Seville O
and O
Granada B-LOC
. O

In O
this O
respect O
he O
explained O
that O
in O
Spain B-LOC
there O
is O
a O
network O
of O
surveillance O
laboratories O
" O
that O
works O
well O
" O
so O
that O
more O
cases O
are O
detected O
than O
in O
other O
countries O
and O
pointed O
out O
that O
Spanish O
researchers O
were O
the O
first O
to O
alert O
to O
this O
problem O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Spain B-LOC
has O
a O
higher O
rate O
of O
AIDS O
patients O
than O
Europe O
and O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
those O
suffering O
from O
it O
are O
intravenous O
toxics O
. O

Leihmaniosis O
was O
until O
now O
a O
veterinary O
problem O
in O
the O
Mediterranean B-MISC
, O
as O
it O
was O
mainly O
suffered O
by O
dogs O
, O
infected O
by O
mosquitos O
. O

However O
, O
said O
Desjeux B-PER
, O
now O
there O
has O
been O
a O
change O
since O
when O
an O
intravenous O
drug O
addict O
contracts O
leishmaniosis O
, O
he O
himself O
becomes O
a O
source O
of O
infection O
through O
the O
shared O
use O
of O
jeringuillas O
. O

The O
most O
serious O
type O
of O
leishmaniosis O
is O
the O
so O
- O
called O
visceral O
( O
LV B-MISC
) O
, O
with O
a O
mortality O
of O
100 O
per O
cent O
if O
not O
treated O
, O
and O
between O
it O
and O
AIDS O
a O
mutual O
reinforcement O
circle O
is O
established O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
LV B-MISC
speeds O
up O
the O
manifestation O
of O
AIDS O
and O
reduces O
the O
life O
expectancy O
of O
people O
infected O
with O
the O
Human B-MISC
Immunodeficiency I-MISC
Virus I-MISC
( O
HIV B-MISC
) O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
HIV B-MISC
promotes O
the O
spread O
of O
this O
type O
of O
leishmaniosis O
. O

The O
two O
combined O
infections O
cause O
a O
double O
immunodeficiency O
because O
leishmaniasis O
and O
HIV B-MISC
destroy O
the O
same O
cells O
, O
so O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
its O
consequences O
increase O
exponentially O
. O

The O
co O
- O
infection O
of O
AIDS O
and O
leishmaniosis O
affects O
the O
whole O
world O
and O
, O
for O
example O
in O

, O
the O

He O
acknowledged O
that O

The O

the O

, O
which O
Andalusia B-LOC
assumed O

, O
is O
the O
most O

of O
the O
budget O

, O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
crisis O
in O
the O
Andalusian O
health O

. O

Although O

" O
this O

Leihmaniosis O
is O
a O
disease O
that O
can O
be O
suffered O
by O
a O
healthy O

without O

it O
, O
but O
in O
cases O
of O

, O
as O
happens O
with O

patients O
, O
this O
disease O
develops O
very O
quickly O
. O

The O
co O
- O
infection O
of O
leishmaniosis O
and O
AIDS O
" O
is O
an O
extremely O
serious O
new O
disease O
" O

" O
, O
according O

Co O

are O
considered O
" O
a O
real O

, O
especially O
in O

" O
and O

Spain B-LOC

Doctor O
Philippe B-PER
Desjeux I-PER
, O
WHO B-ORG
specialist O
, O
told O
EFE B-ORG
that O
the O
cities O
in O
Spain B-LOC
where O
more O
cases O
of O
double O

have O
been O
recorded O
are O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
Seville O
and O
Granada B-LOC
. O

He O
explained O
that O
in O
Spain B-LOC
there O
is O
a O
network O
of O
surveillance O
laboratories O
" O
that O
works O
well O
" O
so O
more O
cases O
are O
detected O
than O
in O
other O
countries O
and O
pointed O
out O
that O
Spanish O
researchers O
were O
the O
first O
to O
alert O
to O
this O
problem O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Spain B-LOC
has O
a O
higher O
rate O
of O
AIDS O
patients O
than O
Europe O
and O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
those O
suffering O
from O
it O
are O
intravenous O
toxics O
. O

Leihmaniosis O
was O
until O
now O
a O
veterinary O
problem O
in O
the O
Mediterranean B-LOC
, O
as O
it O
was O
mainly O
suffered O
by O
dogs O
, O
infected O
by O
mosquitos O
. O

However O
, O
said O
Desjeux B-PER
, O
a O
change O
has O
occurred O
since O
when O
an O
intravenous O
drug O
addict O
contracts O
leishmaniosis O
, O
he O
himself O
becomes O
a O
source O
of O
infection O
through O
the O
shared O
use O
of O
jeringuillas O
. O

The O
most O
serious O
type O
of O
leishmaniosis O
is O
the O
so O
- O
called O
visceral O
( O
LV B-MISC
) O
, O
with O
a O
mortality O
of O
100 O
per O
cent O
if O
not O
treated O
, O
and O
between O
it O
and O
AIDS O
a O
mutual O
reinforcement O
circle O
is O
established O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
LV B-MISC
speeds O
up O
the O
manifestation O
of O
AIDS O
and O
reduces O
the O
life O
expectancy O
of O
people O
infected O
with O
the O
Human B-MISC
Immunodeficiency I-MISC
Virus I-MISC
( O
HIV B-MISC
) O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
HIV B-MISC
promotes O
the O
spread O
of O
this O
type O
of O
leishmaniosis O
. O

The O
two O
combined O
infections O
cause O
a O
double O
immunodeficiency O
because O
leishmaniasis O
and O
HIV B-MISC
destroy O
the O
same O
cells O
, O
so O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
its O
consequences O
increase O
exponentially O
. O

The O
co O
- O
infection O
of O
AIDS O
and O
leishmaniosis O
affects O
the O
whole O
world O
and O
, O
for O
example O
in O
Latin O
America B-LOC
the O
largest O
number O
of O
cases O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
Brazil B-LOC
. O

As O
far O
as O
Africa B-LOC
is O
concerned O
, O
the O
number O
of O
reported O
cases O
gives O
a O
" O
very O
modest O
estimate O
" O
, O
which O
would O
be O
much O
higher O
if O
there O
were O
more O
vigilance O
on O
the O
continent O
. O

The O
WHO B-ORG
points O
out O
that O
the O
co O
- O
infection O
of O
leishmaniasis O
with O
HIV B-MISC
brings O
with O
it O
specific O
diagnostic O
problems O
, O
as O
in O

they O
give O
42.6 O

there O
has O
been O
a O
very O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O

that O
the O

, O
so O
if O
the O
oil O
companies O
did O
not O
take O
the O

then O
the O
state B-ORG
would O
not O
collect O

stressed O
that O
" O
the O

out O

regain O

that O

The O
next O
step O
, O
at O

ten O

Dalton B-PER

would O

which O
has O
enormous O

This O

that O
" O
if O
you O
start O

the O
first O

be O

, O
so O
he O
hoped O
that O

However O
, O
the O
predictions O
of O
those O
who O
already O

go O
further O

The O

after O
highlighting O
this O
possibility O
, O
stated O
that O
her O
company O

offers O
travel O
" O
of O
zero O
gravity O
" O
, O
currently O
" O
accessible O
to O
a O
few O
" O
due O
to O
their O
high O
prices O
, O
but O
that O
" O
will O
be O
extendable O
to O

within O
a O
few O
decades O
when O
, O
of O

, O

organizes O
flights O
where O
passengers O
experience O
the O
absence O
of O
gravity O
, O
at O
about O
80,000 O
feet O
, O
but O
the O
prices O
" O
are O
almost O
prohibitive O
" O
, O
since O
they O
cost O
two O
million O

for O
a O

of O
just O
a O
few O
hours O
" O
, O
said O
. O

According O
to O
Dalton B-PER
, O
the O
next O
step O
, O
which O
could O
be O
taken O
within O
three O
to O
five O
years O
, O
will O
be O
the O
sub O
- O
orbital O
journey O
- O
to O
about O
a O
hundred O
kilometers O
from O
the O
Earth B-MISC
- O
, O
the O
duration O
of O
which O
will O
be O
30 O
. O
90 O
minutes O
and O
will O
cost O
about O
98,000 O
dollars O
, O
more O
than O
ten O
million O
pesetas O
to O
the O
current O
exchange O
rate O

has O
already O
reserved O
140 O

for O
one O

these O

, O
in O
which O
four O
to O
twelve O
people O
will O
travel O
per O

, O
who O
will O
have O
to O
face O
a O
week O
of O
training O
before O
face O
the O
experience O
of O
getting O
into O
space O
. O

The O
next O
step O
, O
at O
least O
ten O
years O
from O
now O
, O
Dalton B-PER
said O
, O
would O
be O
the O
construction O
of O
space O
hotels O
, O
an O
initiative O
already O
underway O
by O
the O
National B-ORG
Space I-ORG
Development I-ORG
Agency I-ORG
of I-ORG
Japan I-ORG
( O
NASDA B-ORG
) O
, O
whose O
special O
investigator O
Patrick B-PER
Collins I-PER
lamented O
today O
the O
lack O
of O
investor O
initiative O
in O
this O
regard O
. O

Collins B-PER
stated O
that O
" O
around O
the O
world O
25 O
trillion O
pesetas O
of O
citizens O
' O
taxes O
are O
collected O
for O
space O
research O
, O
but O
at O
the O
moment O
no O
official O
funds O
are O
allocated O
to O
move O
this O
way O
forward O
, O
which O
has O
enormous O
prospects O
for O
the O
future O
" O
. O

This O
researcher O
stressed O
that O
" O
if O
you O
start O
working O
in O
this O
field O
already O
, O
the O
first O
space O
hotel O
would O
be O
a O
reality O
in O
ten O
years O
" O
, O
so O
he O
hoped O
that O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
decades O
a O
group O
of O
select O
tourists O
could O
spend O
two O
days O
of O
holiday O
in O
a O
space O
hotel O
for O
a O
price O
of O
three O
million O
pesetas O
. O

Taking O
a O
trip O
to O
the O
unknown O
, O
breaking O
the O
barriers O
of O
the O
earth O
's O
space O
, O
experiencing O
the O
absence O
of O
gravity O
or O
seeing O
a O
sunset O
every O
ninety O
minutes O
are O
" O
attractive O
too O
appealing O
" O
as O
to O
catch O
tourists O
, O
although O
at O
the O
moment O
can O
only O
be O
of O
high O
purchasing O
power O
, O
agreed O
in O
their O
exhibitions O
. O

However O
, O
the O
predictions O
of O
those O
who O
already O
work O
in O
the O
field O
of O
space O
tourism O
go O
further O
, O
since O
it O
is O
thought O
of O
the O
construction O
of O
sports O
fields O
in O
space O
, O
a O
challenge O
that O
, O
to O
the O
essence O
of O
their O
interventions O
, O
" O
is O
closer O
to O
what O
most O
people O
can O
imagine O

the O

the O

that O
" O
we O

The O

the O
Consell B-ORG

Menorca I-ORG
, O
Joana B-PER
Barceló I-PER
( O
PSOE B-ORG
) O
, O
considers O
that O
the O
formula O
to O
cover O
the O
ecotax O
in O
hotel O
establishments O
, O
for O
accommodation O
, O
" O
is O
not O
the O
ideal O
model O
" O
, O
and O
opined O
that O
it O
would O
be O
preferable O
to O
charge O
it O
at O

. O

Barceló B-PER
made O
these O
considerations O
after O
carrying O
out O
an O
initial O
analysis O
of O
the O
draft O
ecotasa O
project O
which O
received O
yesterday O
from O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
regional O
president O
, O
Francesc B-PER
Antich I-PER
. O

This O
project O
envisages O
the O
reduction O
of O
the O
green O
tax O
through O
hotels O
and O
other O
legalised O
tourist O
sites O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
one O

of O

, O
measures O
which O
are O
intended O
in O
principle O
to O
be O
applied O
from O
the O
next O
tourist O
season O
. O

Barceló B-PER
considers O
that O
this O
way O
of O
charging O
the O
ecotasa O
" O
does O
not O
constitute O
the O
ideal O
model O
" O
regarding O
the O
initial O
option O
consisting O
of O
a O
collection O
through O
air O
and O
boat O
tickets O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Government B-ORG
has O
ruled O
out O
due O
to O
various O
technical O
problems O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
response O
of O
Aena B-ORG
to O
this O
initiative O
. O

According O
to O
the O
president O
of O
the O
Consell B-ORG
menorquín O
" O
with O
the O
first O
system O
it O
was O
much O
easier O
to O
understand O
to O
the O
tourist O
who O
was O
paid O
to O
visit O
Menorca B-LOC
, O
for O
doing O
tourism O
on O
the O
island O
, O
instead O
now O
it O
is O
a O
model O
in O
which O
you O
pay O
according O
to O
your O
stay O
" O
. O

In O
line O
with O
what O
has O
been O
stated O
by O
the O
hotels O
in O
Menorca O
, O
Joana B-PER
Barceló I-PER
, O
explains O
that O
this O
model O
" O
will O
be O
difficult O
to O
apply O
in O
Menorca B-LOC
because O
of O
the O
number O
of O
seats O
that O
exist O
outside O
the O
legalized O
high O
. O

It O
is O
also O
the O
island O
where O
the O
tourist O
season O
is O
shorter O
. O

All O
this O
will O
motivate O
visitors O
who O
do O
not O
pay O
" O
. O

The O
President O
of O
the O
Consell B-ORG
de I-ORG
Menorca I-ORG
intends O
to O
meet O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
with O
the O
professional O
associations O
of O
the O

sector O
in O
Menorca O
to O
study O
the O
proposals O
that O
can O
improve O
the O
first O
draft O
of O
the O
text O
of O
the O
ecotasa O
delivered O
yesterday O
by O
the O
Government B-ORG
to O
the O
presidents O
of O
the O
three O
island O
councils O
. O

Joana B-PER
Barceló I-PER
also O
pointed O
out O
that O
so O
far O
she O
has O
only O
been O
able O
to O
make O
a O
quick O
first O
reading O
of O
the O
law O
and O
that O
she O
now O
needs O
to O
make O
a O
second O
more O
pause O
in O
order O
to O
see O
the O
transcripts O
of O
the O
text O
. O

This O
second O
analysis O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
take O
a O
" O
minorquinist O
" O
perspective O
to O
know O
what O
aspects O
affect O

argues O
that O

" O
in O

For O
Rodríguez B-PER
Cancho I-PER
, O
" O
these O
taxes O
can O
never O
exceed O
the O
IPC B-MISC

that O
is O
the O
fundamental O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
" O
if O
education O
, O
being O
transferred O
to O
competition O

economic O
responsibility O
, O
does O
not O
mean O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O

it O

For O
