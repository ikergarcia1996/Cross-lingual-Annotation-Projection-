La B-ORG
Manga I-ORG
Club I-ORG
complex O
, O
located O
in O
the O
Murcian O
town O
of O
Los B-LOC
Belones I-LOC
. O

That O
concentration O
is O

the O
final O
match O
of O
the O
Copa B-MISC
del I-MISC
Rey I-MISC
that O
will O
be O
played O
next O
Saturday O
against O
the O
Atlético B-ORG
de I-ORG
Madrid I-ORG
. O

The O
session O
of O
the O
blanquiazul O
team O
lasted O
for O
two O
hours O
and O
in O
it O
the O
coach O
, O
Paco B-PER
Flores I-PER
, O
provided O
an O
eminently O
physical O
job O
, O
although O
the O
players O
also O
played O
the O
ball O
. O

The O
main O
novelty O
of O
the O
day O
was O
, O
precisely O
, O
the O
use O
of O
the O
spherical O
that O
will O
be O
used O
in O
the O
upcoming O
Euro B-MISC
Cup I-MISC
in O
Belgium B-LOC

the O

After O
the O
training O
, O
Flores B-PER
himself O
spoke O
about O
the O
characteristics O
of O
the O
new O
ball O
and O
said O
that O
" O
it O
is O
totally O
different O
from O
what O
is O
used O
in O
the O
League B-MISC
. O

With O
it O
you O
win O
in O
effect O
, O
but O
you O
lose O
in O
speed O
. O
” O

" O
In O
any O
case O
, O
my O
team O
, O
like O
Atlético B-ORG
, O
has O
a O
week O
to O
adapt O
to O
it O
and O
we O
have O
to O
get O
used O
to O
its O
use O
in O
that O
short O
period O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

Referring O
to O
the O
place O
of O
concentration O
, O
the O
Prince B-LOC
Felipe I-LOC
hotel I-LOC
and O
its O
surroundings O
, O
Flores B-PER
pointed O
out O
that O
" O
it O
is O
a O
wonderful O
and O
suitable O
place O
to O
prepare O
a O
game O
of O
the O
caliber O
that O
will O
be O
played O
on O
Saturday O
" O
. O

Toni B-PER
Soldevila I-PER
, O
who O
was O
injured O
on O
Friday O
, O
said O
: O
" O
We O
must O
accept O
that O
we O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
count O
on O
him O
and O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
want O
at O
this O
time O
for O
him O
is O
to O
improve O
his O
injury O
in O
the O
shortest O
possible O
time O
. O

That O
’s O
why O
he O
has O
stayed O
in O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
because O
there O
we O
have O
enough O
means O
for O
his O
recovery O
: O
laser O
, O
radar O
and O
ultrasound O
. O
” O

The O
Spanish O
team O
will O
return O
to O
work O
tomorrow O
morning O
in O
the O
football O
center O
of O
the O
La B-LOC
Manga I-LOC
Club I-LOC
complex O
, O
while O
the O
afternoons O
are O
aimed O
at O
the O
recovery O
of O
the O
footballers O
, O
said O
Carlos B-PER
Lorenzano I-PER
, O
the O
club O
's O
physical O
preparer O
. O

On O
the O
work O
scheduled O
for O
the O
next O
few O
days O
, O
Flores B-PER
said O
: O
“ O
With O
him O
we O
will O
try O
to O
win O
in O
speed O
, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
virtues O
this O
team O
has O
. O

We O
will O
also O
study O
the O
Atlético B-ORG

Madrid I-ORG
, O
which O
in O
its O
last O
visits O
to O
Oviedo B-LOC
and O
Palma B-LOC
de I-LOC
Mallorca I-LOC
has O
experienced O
a O
remarkable O
improvement O
in O
its O
game O
. O

Whenever O
a O
team O
changes O
coach O
, O
this O
usually O
increases O
its O
performance O
and O
, O
respecting O
Antic B-PER
, O
I O
think O
that O
Atlético B-ORG
is O
benefiting O
from O
the O
arrival O
of O
Zambrano B-PER
. O
” O

Flores B-PER
thinks O
that O
the O
concentration O
of O
the O
Espanyol B-ORG
is O
favorable O
to O
flee O
the O
" O
euforia O
" O
that O
has O
resulted O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
blanquiazul O
team O
in O
the O
final O
coper O
. O

As O
far O
away O
from O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
the O
feeling O
of O
euphoria O
is O
also O
far O
away O
. O

I O
try O
not O
to O
read O
the O
press O
and O
I O
prefer O
that O
my O
players O
do O
n’t O
do O
it O
either O
to O
avoid O
being O
infected O
with O
the O
sensations O
that O
are O
outside O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
I O
will O
try O
to O
make O
all O
the O
pressure O
fall O
on O
me O
and O
not O
on O
my O
players O
, O
because O
so O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
show O
the O
football O
they O
carry O
inside O
, O
” O
Flores B-PER
explained O
. O

He O
also O
acknowledged O
: O
" O
What O
interests O
me O
most O
is O
to O
motivate O
the O
eleven O
to O
jump O
to O
the O
playing O
field O
before O
Atlético B-ORG
, O
because O
they O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
will O
give O
us O
food O
. O

I O
want O
everyone O
to O
know O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
be O
in O
alignment O
. O

In O
short O
, O
I O
want O
to O
value O
very O
much O
what O
it O
costs O
to O
be O
a O
titular O
and O
that O
those O
who O
are O
hold O
to O
that O
condition O
not O
to O
abandon O
it O
. O
” O

The O
coach O
of O
the O
Espanyol B-ORG
indicated O
: O
" O
I O
always O
bet O
on O
my O
team O
and O
poor O
of O
the O
coach O
who O
does O
not O
do O
so O
, O
because O
he O
will O
have O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
lost O
match O
" O
and O
nuanced O
that O
" O
between O
my O
team O
and O
the O
Atlético B-ORG
there O
are O
no O
differences O
in O

The O
officials O
of O
the O

alerted O
the O
police B-ORG

him O
a O
few O

further O
down O
when O
he O
threw O
a O
bag O
inside O
a O
glass O
container O
. O

The O

handed O
him O
three O
gold O
cards O
from O
the O
United B-ORG
Overseas I-ORG
, O
Commonwealth B-ORG

Public B-ORG
banks O
, O
in O

that O

Days O
after O
his O
arrest O
, O
a O
fourth O

After O
the O

It O
is O
feared O
that O

appear O
to O

In O
the O

yesterday O
this O
fear O
caused O
a O
very O
low O
for O
almost O
the O
whole O

but O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
a O
current O
of O
low O
- O
priced O

prevented O
a O
low O
of O
large O
proportions O
. O

At O
today O

, O
the O

moved O
between O
the O
pessimism O
about O
the O
future O
of O

and O
the O
certain O
optimism O
that O
generated O
yesterday O
’s O
last O
- O
minute O
rise O
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
the O
general O
characteristic O
of O
the O
market O
is O
the O
true O
“ O
apathy O
” O
of O

, O
who O
do O
not O

to O
solve O
the O
problem O
of O
waiting O
lists O
. O

For O
the O
Socialist O
spokeswoman O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
a O
working O
group O
has O
been O
constituted O
to O
end O
this O
problem O
demonstrates O
that O
" O
the O
excellences O
on O
the O
reduction O
of O
the O
waiting O

of O
which O
spoke O
the O
previous O
Minister O
of O
Health B-MISC
, O
José B-PER
Manuel I-PER
Romay I-PER
, O
were O
not O
true O
" O
. O

According O
to O
Valentín B-PER
, O
the O
parameters O
that O
Sanidad B-MISC
uses O
to O
offer O
the O
data O
on O
waiting O
lists O
, O
with O
concepts O
such O
as O
the O
average O
delay O
, O
should O
be O
changed O
, O
while O
advocating O
a O
comprehensive O
analysis O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
delay O
occurs O
in O
each O
service O
. O

Another O
of O
the O
proposals O
made O
by O
the O
socialist O
deputy O
was O
the O
opening O
of O
all O
the O

" O

said O
that O
the O
appointment O

Rubén B-PER
Moreno I-PER

He O
added O
that O
putting O

of O
this O

a O

linked O
to O
the O

of O
the O

, O
managed O
by O
a O
private O

and O
that O

, O
" O
we O
are O
concerned O

to O
make O

( O

stated O
today O
in O
a O
statement O
that O
the O
policy O
followed O
by O
the O
ministry O
on O
waiting O
lists O
has O
so O
far O
been O
characterized O
by O
the O
" O
systematic O
makeup O
of O
the O
same O
" O
and O
by O
the O
indiscriminate O
evaluation O
of O
waiting O

for O
all O
people O
who O
are O
on O
waiting O

without O
taking O
into O

the O
severity O

. O

For O
the O
FADSP B-ORG
, O
it O
is O
not O
so O
much O
about O
the O
disappearance O
of O
waiting O
lists O
, O
but O
that O
these O
are O
made O
rational O
, O
the O
delays O
are O
not O
excessive O
and O
adjust O
to O

that O

such O

itself O

that O

The O

said O
that O
those O

defended O
by O
the O
peasant O

with O
“ O

Dr. O
Philippe B-PER
Desjeux I-PER
, O
a O
WHO B-ORG
specialist O
, O
told O
EFE B-ORG
that O
the O
cities O
in O

where O
the O
most O
cases O
of O

have O
been O
recorded O
are O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
Seville O
and O
Granada B-LOC
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
he O
explained O
that O
in O
Spain B-LOC
there O
is O
a O
network O
of O
surveillance O
laboratories O
" O
which O
works O
well O
" O
so O
that O
more O
cases O
are O
detected O
than O
in O
other O
countries O
and O
pointed O
out O
that O
Spanish O
researchers O
were O
the O
first O
to O
alert O
to O
this O
problem O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Spain B-LOC
has O
a O
higher O
AIDS O
rate O
than O
Europe O
and O
a O
good O
part O
of O
those O
who O
suffer O
from O
it O
are O
intravenous O
drug O
addicts O
. O

Leishmaniosis O
was O
until O
now O
a O
veterinary O
problem O
in O
the O
Mediterranean B-MISC
, O
because O
it O
was O
mostly O
suffered O
by O
dogs O
, O
infected O
by O
mosquitoes O
. O

However O
, O
Desjeux B-PER
said O
, O
a O
change O
has O
now O
occurred O
because O
when O
an O
intravenous O
drug O
addict O
contracts O
leishmaniosis O
, O
he O
himself O
becomes O
a O
source O
of O
contagion O
through O
the O
shared O
use O
of O
syringes O
. O

The O
most O
serious O
type O
of O
leishmaniosis O
is O
the O
so O
- O
called O
visceral O
( O
LV B-MISC
) O
, O
with O
a O
mortality O
of O
one O
hundred O
percent O
if O
not O
treated O
, O
and O
between O
it O
and O
AIDS O
a O
circle O
of O
mutual O
reinforcement O
is O
established O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
LV B-MISC
makes O
the O
manifestation O
of O
AIDS O
faster O
and O
reduces O
the O
life O
expectancy O
of O
people O
infected O
with O
the O
Human B-MISC
Immunodeficiency I-MISC
Virus I-MISC
( O
HIV B-MISC
) O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
HIV B-MISC
favors O
the O
spread O
of O
this O
type O
of O
leishmaniosis O
. O

The O
two O
conjugated O
infections O
cause O
double O
immunodeficiency O
because O
leishmaniosis O
and O
HIV B-MISC
destroy O
the O
same O
cells O
, O
so O
that O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
its O
consequences O
increase O
exponentially O
. O

Co O
- O
infection O
with O
AIDS O

everyone O
and O
, O
for O

, O

the O

Leishmaniosis O
is O
a O
disease O
that O
can O
suffer O
a O
healthy O

without O
manifesting O
it O

but O
in O

this O

” O
according O

Co O

in O

Dr. O
Philippe B-PER
Desjeux I-PER
, O
a O
WHO B-ORG
specialist O
, O
told O

that O
the O
cities O
in O

where O
the O
most O
cases O
of O
double O
infection O
have O
been O
recorded O
are O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
Seville O
and O
Granada B-LOC
. O

He O
explained O
that O
in O
Spain B-LOC
there O
is O
a O
network O
of O
surveillance O
laboratories O
" O
which O
works O
well O
" O
so O
that O
more O
cases O
are O
detected O
than O
in O
other O
countries O
and O
pointed O
out O
that O
Spanish O
researchers O
were O
the O
first O
to O
alert O
to O
this O
problem O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Spain B-LOC
has O
a O
higher O
AIDS O
rate O
than O
Europe O
and O
a O
good O
part O
of O
those O
who O
suffer O
from O
it O
are O
intravenous O
drug O
addicts O
. O

Leishmaniosis O
was O
until O
now O
a O
veterinary O
problem O
in O
the O
Mediterranean B-LOC
, O
because O
it O
was O
mostly O
suffered O
by O
dogs O
, O
infected O
by O
mosquitoes O
. O

However O
, O
Desjeux B-PER
said O
, O
a O
change O
has O
occurred O
because O
when O
an O
intravenous O
drug O
addict O
contracts O
leishmaniosis O
, O
he O
himself O
becomes O
a O
source O
of O
contagion O
through O
the O
shared O
use O
of O
syringes O
. O

The O
most O
serious O
type O
of O
leishmaniosis O
is O
the O
so O
- O
called O
visceral O
( O
LV B-MISC
) O
, O
with O
a O
mortality O
of O
one O
hundred O
percent O
if O
not O
treated O
, O
and O
between O
it O
and O
AIDS O
a O
circle O
of O
mutual O
reinforcement O
is O
established O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
LV B-MISC
makes O
the O
manifestation O
of O
AIDS O
faster O
and O
reduces O
the O
life O
expectancy O
of O
people O
infected O
with O
the O
Human B-MISC
Immunodeficiency I-MISC
Virus I-MISC
( O
HIV B-MISC
) O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
HIV B-MISC
favors O
the O
spread O
of O
this O
type O
of O
leishmaniosis O
. O

The O
two O
conjugated O
infections O
cause O
double O
immunodeficiency O
because O
leishmaniosis O
and O
HIV B-MISC
destroy O
the O
same O
cells O
, O
so O
that O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
its O
consequences O
increase O
exponentially O
. O

Co O
- O
infection O
with O
AIDS O
and O
leishmaniosis O
affects O
everyone O
and O
, O
for O
example O
, O
in O
Latin O
America B-LOC
the O
highest O
number O
of O
cases O
has O
been O
in O
Brazil B-LOC
. O

As O
for O
Africa B-LOC
, O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
gives O
" O
a O
very O
modest O
estimate O
" O
, O
which O
would O
be O
quite O
higher O
if O
there O
were O
greater O
surveillance O
on O
the O
continent O
. O

The O
WHO B-ORG
notes O
that O
co O
- O
infection O
with O
leishmaniosis O
and O
HIV B-MISC
involves O
particular O
problems O
at O
the O
diagnostic O
level O
because O
in O
serological O
detections O
they O
give O
42.6 O
percent O
of O
negative O
results O
in O
individuals O
who O
suffer O
from O
it O
, O
as O
seropositive O

The O
next O
step O
, O
at O
a O
minimum O
of O
ten O
years O
, O
Dalton B-PER
pointed O
out O
, O
will O
be O
the O
construction O

, O
an O
initiative O
in O
which O
the O
National B-ORG

is O
already O

whose O
special O
researcher O
Patrick B-PER
Collins I-PER
lamented O
today O
the O
lack O
of O

initiative O
in O
this O
regard O
. O

Collins B-PER
stated O
that O
“ O
worldwide O
, O
25 O
trillion O
pesetas O
are O
collected O
from O
citizens O
’ O
taxes O
for O
space O
research O
, O
but O
currently O
no O
official O

are O
allocated O
to O
advance O
this O
path O
, O
which O
has O
enormous O
prospects O
for O
the O
future O
. O
” O

This O
researcher O
stressed O
that O
" O
if O
we O
begin O
to O
work O
already O
in O
this O
field O
, O
the O
first O
space O
hotel O
would O
be O
a O
reality O
in O
ten O
years O
" O
, O
so O
he O
said O
that O
within O
two O
decades O
a O
group O
of O
selected O
tourists O
will O
be O
able O
to O
spend O
two O
days O
of O
holidays O
in O
a O
space O
hotel O
for O
a O
price O
of O
three O
million O
pesetas O

Undertaking O
a O
journey O
toward O
the O
unknown O
, O
breaking O
the O
barriers O
of O
terrestrial O
space O
, O
experiencing O
the O
absence O
of O
gravity O
or O
seeing O
a O
sunset O
every O
ninety O

are O
" O
extremely O
striking O
attractions O
" O
as O
to O
capture O
tourists O
, O
although O
at O
the O
moment O
they O
can O
only O
be O
of O
high O
purchasing O
power O
, O
they O
coincided O
in O
their O
exhibitions O
. O

However O
, O
the O
forecasts O
of O
those O
who O
already O
work O
in O
the O
field O
of O
space O
tourism O
go O
beyond O
, O
as O
it O
is O
thought O
about O
the O
construction O
of O
sports O
fields O
in O
space O
, O
a O
challenge O
that O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
its O

, O
“ O

that O

the O

According O
to O

, O
the O
next O
step O
, O
which O

will O
be O
the O

more O
than O
sixteen O

in O

four O

who O

The O
next O
step O
, O
at O
a O
minimum O
of O
ten O
years O
, O
Dalton B-PER
pointed O
out O
, O
will O
be O
the O
construction O
of O

, O
an O
initiative O
in O
which O
the O
National B-ORG

( O

is O
already O
working O
, O
whose O
special O
researcher O
Patrick B-PER
Collins I-PER
lamented O
today O
the O
lack O
of O
investment O
initiative O
in O
this O
regard O
. O

Collins B-PER
stated O
that O
“ O
worldwide O
, O
25 O
trillion O
pesetas O
are O
collected O
from O
citizens O
’ O
taxes O
for O
space O
research O
, O
but O
currently O
no O
official O
funds O
are O
allocated O
to O
advance O
this O
path O
, O
which O
has O
enormous O
prospects O
for O
the O
future O
. O
” O

This O
researcher O
stressed O
that O
" O
if O
we O
begin O
to O
work O
already O
in O
this O
field O
, O
the O
first O
space O
hotel O
would O
be O
a O
reality O
in O
ten O
years O
" O
, O
so O
he O
said O
that O
within O
two O
decades O
a O
group O
of O
selected O
tourists O
will O
be O
able O
to O
spend O
two O
days O
of O
holidays O
in O
a O
space O
hotel O
for O
a O
price O
of O
three O
million O
pesetas O

Undertaking O
a O
journey O
toward O

, O
breaking O

, O
experiencing O
the O
absence O
of O

they O

only O
be O
of O
high O
purchasing O

they O

However O
, O
the O
forecasts O
of O
those O
who O
already O
work O
in O
the O

of O

go O
beyond O

it O
is O
thought O
about O

a O

considers O
that O
this O

“ O
with O

for O

explains O
that O
this O

" O
will O

the O

, O
it O
is O
the O

the O
