The O

recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party O
: O

A O
vice O
in O
which O
no O
one O
who O
is O
known O
as O
a O
geologist O
and O
aspires O
to O
be O
recognised O
as O
such O
must O
never O
enter O
is O
that O
of O
patriotism O
, O
understood O
as O
the O
excessive O
and O
inappropriate O
ardor O
of O
patriotism O
: O
the O
geologist O
is O
not O
apprehensive O
, O
but O
must O
flee O
as O
from O
the O
plague O
of O
communism O
. O

Years O
ago O
, O
in O
one O
of O
his O
travel O
books O
, O
the O
Nobel O
laureate O
of B-PER
literature I-PER
Camilo I-PER
José I-PER
Cela I-PER
stated O
that O
the O
patriot O
is O
who O
is O
proud O
of O
the O
place O
where O
he O
was O
born O
and O
defends O
it O
, O
attitude O
in O
which O
he O
is O
right O
, O
while O
the O
patriot O
- O
at O
the O
time O
, O
Cela B-PER
used O
the O
word O
' O
nationalist O
' O
- O
is O
the O
one O
who O
proclaims O
against O
the O
wind O
. O
sea O
that O
his O
homeland O
is O
in O
everything O
superior O
to O
the O
others O
, O
which O
- O
said O
Cela B-PER
- O
well O
might O
not O
be O
right O
. O

There O
is O
too O
much O
patriotism O
in O
this O
food O
. O

One O
has O
no O
problem O
in O
accepting O
that O
everyone O
defends O
the O
cuisine O
and O
products O
of O
their O
land O
... O
provided O
that O
this O
defence O
does O
not O
imply O
contempt O
because O
it O
is O
alien O
to O
the O
culinary O
customs O
of O
their O
solar O
homeland O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
it O
will O
have O
to O
pass O
from O
Cela B-PER
to O
Antonio B-PER
Machado I-PER
and O
remember O
that O
of O
" O
contempt O
what O
ignores O
... O

" O
The O
problem O
of O
gastronomy O
patriotism O
- O
and O
, O
let O
us O
not O
be O
fooled O
, O
of O
any O
other O
- O
is O
precisely O
this O
: O
ignorance O
. O

Of O
course O
that O
same O
ignorance O
can O
make O
many O
fall O
into O
the O
opposite O
flaw O
: O
the O

let O
us O
say O
, O
boarding O
which O
makes O
for O
these O
citizens O
everything O
abroad O
is O
better O
. O

Well O
... O
neither O
. O

A O
astronomer O
is O
something O
like O
a O
traveler O
, O
but O
a O
traveler O
, O
not O
a O
tourist O
; O
a O
traveler O
, O
say O
, O
in O
the O
19th O
century O

a O
person O
full O
of O
curiosity O
and O
freed O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
of O
prejudices O
, O
willing O
to O
accept O
the O
good O
things O
of O
others O
without O
thereby O
rejecting O
their O
own O
. O

But O
this O
universality O
of O
the O
gastronomer O
- O
the O
first O
to O
universalize O
gastronomy O
were O
the O
Romans O
- O
does O
not O
imply O
giving O
up O
on O
oneself O
. O

Much O
less O
the O
absurd O
mescolanzas O
, O
that O
kitchen O
today O
we O
call O
' O
of O

' O
, O
very O

not O
derive O

as O
in O
so O
many O
cases O

in O

We O
will O
always O
insist O
that O

to O
be O
faithful O
to O
its O
land O

also O
to O
its O
time O
. O

But O
it O
must O
, O
how O
not O
, O
be O
open O
to O
forensic O
incorporations O
. O

What O
would O
be O
of O
European O
cuisine O
, O
for O
example O
, O
without O
potatoes O
; O
or O
of O
Mediterranean O

, O
both O
products O
that O
arrived O
in O
the O
Old B-MISC
World I-MISC
less O
than O
five O
centuries O
ago O
... O

Imagine O
that O
among O
those O
Spaniards O
, O
who O
were O
the O
ones O
who O
brought O
those O
American O
gifts O
to O
Europe B-LOC

been O
imposed O

: O
potatoes O

would O
have O
remained O
in O

curiosities O
. O

There O
is O
, O
there O
can O
not O
be O

a O
universal O
cuisine O
; O
remember O
that O
horror O
known O
as O
' O
international O
cuisine O
' O
so O
common O
in O
hotel O
restaurants O
. O

But O
there O
can O
also O
be O
a O
kitchen O
locked O
in O
itself O
. O

You O
can O
not O
ask O
, O
in O
front O
of O
a O
new O
food O
, O
a O
new O
hairstyle O
, O
where O
does O
this O
come O
from O
? O
, O
without O
researching O
before O
the O
really O

: O
is O
it O
rich O

Well O
, O
if O
you O
are O
rich O
... O
go O
ahead O

come O
from O
where O
you O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
have O
to O
study O
how O
we O
adapt O
this O
new O
product O
to O
our O
most O
hardened O
culinary O
uses O
. O

Thus O
, O
our O
cuisine O
evolves O
, O
it O
enriches O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
wrapping O
itself O
, O
ends O
up O
weakening O
and O
extinguishing O

endogamia O
is O
not O
good O
for O
almost O
nothing O
. O

Have O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
open O
mind O

and O
the O
more O
senses O
still O

That O
, O
paraphrasing O

there O

more O
rich O

Do O

Although O

the O

incomplete O

because O

this O

, O
the O

The O

where O

also O

a O
great O

Damascus B-ORG

The O
withdrawal O
of O
Israel B-ORG
from O
the O
south O
was O
part O
of O
the O
strategy O
of O
Israeli O
Prime O
Minister O

to O
force O
Syria B-ORG
into O
negotiations O
on O
the O
Golan B-LOC

occupied O

Israel B-ORG

In O
theory O
, O
Syria B-ORG
is O
harmed O
by O
the O
unilateral O
Israeli O
withdrawal O
from O
the O
southern O
Lebanon O
, O
since O
it O
deprives O
Damascus B-ORG

a O
letter O
that O
it O
used O
, O
through O
Hezbollah B-ORG

to O
put O
pressure O
on O
Israel B-ORG

However O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
Damascus B-ORG
, O
which O
is O
inflexible O
on O
the O
question O
of O
the O
return O
of O
the O
Golan B-LOC
to O
the O
line O
of O
demarcation O
prior O
to O
June O
1967 O
, O
seems O
to O
have O
forced O
Israel B-ORG
to O
carry O
out O
its O
threat O
and O
has O
resulted O
in O
strengthened O
its O
control O
of O
Lebanon B-LOC
. O

If O
Israel B-ORG
occupied O
ten O
per O
cent O
of O
Lebanese O
territory O
, O
Syrian O
troops O
are O
deployed O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
and O
it O
is O
not O
ruled O
out O
that O
they O
can O
be O
assigned O
a O
mission O
in O
southern O
Lebanon B-LOC
, O
making O
their O
withdrawal O
complicated O
, O
despite O
the O
wishes O
of O
a O
majority O
of O
Lebanese O
. O

The O
major O
powers O
have O
assigned O
Syria B-ORG
the O
role O
of O
Lebanon O
's O
guardian O
and O
they O
know O
that O
if O
they O
do O
not O
reach O
an O
agreement O
with O
Israel B-ORG
, O
the O
Lebanese O
situation O
will O
remain O
insecure O
and O
unpredictable O
. O

The O
only O
hope O
for O
the O
Lebanese O
situation O
to O
stabilize O
is O
for O
a O
global O
peace O
in O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party O
: O

The O
Israeli O
Army B-ORG
has O
adapted O
its O
concept O
of O
security O
to O
the O
new O
reality O
created O
after O
the O
evacuation O
of O
southern O
Lebanon B-LOC

which O
consists O
in O
defending O
its O

within O
its O
own O
soil O
instead O
of O
fighting O
the O
Hezbollah B-ORG
integral O
group O
on O
Lebanese O
territory O
, O
its O
commander O
explained O
today O
. O

The O
Chief O
of O
the O
Israeli O
Army B-ORG
, O
General O
Shaul B-PER
Mofaz I-PER
, O
said O
this O
included O
the O
order O
to O
open O
fire O
, O
although O
he O
ruled O
that O
" O
the O
soldiers O
must O
be O
very O
careful O
not O
to O
make O
mistakes O
that O
lead O
to O
an O
escalation O

" O
. O

That O
means O
that O
Israeli O
soldiers O
will O
not O
shoot O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
see O
Hezbollah B-ORG
guerrillas O
- O
as O
they O
have O
done O
so O
far O
in O
the O
southern O
Lebanon O
- O
and O
they O
will O
not O
interfere O
with O
Syrian O
troops O
, O
whose O
country O
actually O
controls O
Lebanon B-LOC

Mofaz B-PER
said O
that O
" O
we O
must O
be O
very O
alert O
" O
and O
added O
that O
in O
the O
coming O
days O
representatives O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
and O
the O
Israeli O
Army B-ORG
will O
examine O
the O
exact O
lines O
of O
the O
international O
border O
with O
Lebanon B-LOC
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
will O
adjust O
their O
deployment O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
Israeli O
Army B-ORG
was O
still O
deploying O
today O
- O
the O
day O
after O
the O
withdrawal O
- O
in O
the O
north O
of O
their O
country O
, O
bordering O
southern O
Lebanon B-LOC

According O
to O
Mofaz B-PER
, O
" O
the O
Israeli O
army B-ORG
left O
Lebanon B-LOC
( O
at O
the O
dawn O
of O
yesterday O
Wednesday O
) O
appropriately O
and O
without O
casualties O
in O
its O

, O
although O
it O
was O
a O

" O
of O
the O
Lebanese O

Iranian O
Hezbollah B-ORG

group O
, O
which O
was O
done O
with O

of O
the O
abandoned O
area O
in O
the O
south O
of O
the O
neighbouring O
Arab O
country O
. O

The O
General O
pointed O
out O
that O
at O
least O
twelve O
guerrillas O
from O
the O
Chinese O
Hezbollah B-ORG
group O
died O
in O
the O
fighting O
, O
which O
was O
also O
done O
with O

by O
Israeli O

, O
an O

of O
Israel B-ORG

The O
Chief O
Commander O
of O
the O
Israeli O
Army B-ORG
stressed O
that O
it O
was O
important O
for O
his O
troops O
to O
leave O
in O
a O
rapid O
operation O
, O
in O
the O
dark O
and O
before O
it O
was O
cleared O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
justification O
for O
soldiers O
to O
put O
their O
lives O
at O
risk O
because O
of O
the O
remaining O
weapons O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

Finally O
, O
Mofaz B-PER
warned O
that O
" O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
anyone O
, O
including O
the O
Palestinians O
, O
to O
draw O
the O
wrong O
conclusions O
about O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
Israeli O

to O
respond O
" O
. O

In O
this O

, O
the O
well O

in O

: O
" O
How O

As O
for O
Lebanon B-LOC

Israel B-ORG
recognizes O
its O
sovereignty O
over O
all O
of O
its O
territory O
, O
but O
demands O
that O
Beirut B-ORG
guarantee O
a O

and O
, O
if O
this O
is O
not O
achieved O
, O
the O
Israeli O
Army B-ORG
is O
prepared O
for O
a O
series O
of O
responses O

This O
was O
noted O
in O

In O
other O
words O
, O
if O
you O
fire O

the O

today O
called O
on O

analyse O
the O

" O
and O
how O
it O
is O
taxing O
such O
an O
important O
product O
for O
the O
Spanish O

" O
. O

The O
Spanish O
authorities O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
are O
being O
very O
unsensitive O
" O
with O
the O
continual O
rise O
in O
the O
price O
of O

given O
that O
" O
they O
have O
not O
introduced O
the O

of O

" O
make O

Cuevas B-PER
made O
these O
statements O
to O
the O

following O
his O
speech O
at O
the O
CEOE O
General B-MISC
Assembly I-MISC
in O
Madrid B-LOC
today O
. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
employers O
' O
association O
described O
the O
government B-ORG
's O
attitude O
as O
" O
inexplicable O
" O
, O
since O
, O
he O
said O
, O
the O
oil O
companies O
are O
doing O
is O
" O
transferring O
the O
price O
increases O
to O
the O
final O
price O
" O
. O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
complex O
problem O
whose O
solution O
depends O
on O
the O
analysis O
of O
several O
factors O
. O

First O
, O
said O
Cuevas B-PER
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
analyse O
the O
conduct O
of O
oil O
tankers O
" O
if O
they O
engage O
in O
any O
defect O
or O
infringement O
of O
competition O
" O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he O
specified O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
study O
the O
rise O
in O
the O
prices O
of O
crude O
from O
the O
main O
producing O
countries O
, O
and O
, O
thirdly O
, O
" O
it O
is O
necessary O
" O
to O
analyse O
the O
role O
played O
by O
taxation O
applied O
by O
different O
governments O
to O
a O
product O
" O
so O
important O
for O
maintaining O
prices O
, O
the O
flexibility O
of O
the O
economy O
and O
the O
competitiveness O
of O
companies O
" O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
precisely O
Cuevas B-PER
, O
" O
taxation O
is O
not O
an O
absolute O
thing O
and O
must O
work O
according O
to O
each O
stage O
presented O
" O
. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
employers O
' O
association O
advocated O
" O
not O
to O
make O
judgments O
a O

" O
of O
the O
simultaneous O
rise O
that O
the O
different O
oil O
companies O
apply O
to O
petrol O
and O
urged O
the O
authorities O
to O
" O
open O
an O
investigation O
" O
if O
they O
consider O
" O
suspicious O
" O
the O
behaviour O
of O
these O
companies O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
considered O
this O
to O
be O
a O
" O
very O
serious O
and O
profound O
" O
problem O
, O
which O
has O
led O
to O
prices O
of O

and O
the O
currency O
with O
which O
it O
is O
to O
be O
paid O

treated O
about O
the O

derived O
, O
depending O
on O
the O

" O
, O
assures O
Bonet B-PER

The O

Bonet B-PER

" O

neither O

out O
that O

of O
this O

, O
which O
has O
the O
support O
of O

, O
thus O
aims O
to O
send O
a O
positive O

in O

, O
The O
document O
carries O
out O
a O
self O
- O
critical O
reading O
on O
the O
impact O
that O
Esquerra B-ORG
has O
had O
so O
far O
- O
it O
has O
not O
exceeded O
10 O
% O
of O
the O

in O
its O
best O
results O
- O
, O
and O
points O
to O
the O
need O
for O
openness O
to O
society O
in O
view O
of O
the O
horizon O
of O
2003 O
, O
an O
openness O
that O
Josep B-PER
Lluís I-PER
Carod I-PER
- O
Rovira O
himself O
proposed O
when O
closing O
the O
election O
campaign O
of O
the O
general O
elections O
and O
before O
the O
vacillation O
of O
the O

was O
known O
. O

Among O
other O
considerations O
, O
the O
statement O
points O
out O
that O
the O
ERC B-ORG
's O
independence O
" O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
an O
immediate O
objective O
" O
and O
furthermore O
" O
must O
be O
accompanied O
by O
other O
dimensions O
and O
must O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
proposal O
for O
a O
better O
life O
for O
all O
and O
not O
only O
as O
a O
satisfaction O
of O
historical O
and O
nostalgic O
rights O
" O
. O

For O
Bonet B-PER
, O
in O
ERC B-ORG
must O
not O
continue O
resistance O
attitudes O
and O
a O
new O
approach O
to O
Catalan O
society O
must O
be O
tested O
" O
because O
we O
can O
not O
refuge O
in O
the O

of O
the O
gods O

" O

. O

" O
We O
have O
to O
open O
up O
to O
sectors O
that O
have O
other O
priority O
interests O
. O

The O
only O
requirement O
is O
that O
they O
recognise O
Catalonia B-ORG
's O
freedom O
of O
self O
- O
determination O
" O
, O
it O
is O
stated O
in O
the O

which O
advises O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party O
: O

The O
PP B-ORG
and O
the O

EE I-ORG
will O
conclude O
the O
budget O
agreement O
for O
the O
Alava B-ORG

this O

after O
agreeing O
to O
grant O
an O
economic O
supplement O
to O
all O

who O
have O
recognised O
a O
benefit O
, O
not O
just O
those O
who O
receive O
a O
non O

. O

According O
to O
the O
Socialist O
spokesman O
in O
the O
General B-ORG
Boards I-ORG
, O
Juan B-PER
Carlos I-PER
Prieto I-PER
, O
and O
subsequently O
ratified O
the O
Alava B-LOC
MEP O
, O
Ramón B-PER
Rabanera I-PER
, O
both O
groups O
will O
approve O
the O
budget O
document O
this O

in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
start O
the O
parliamentary O
procedure O
and O
that O
the O
General B-ORG
Boards I-ORG
can O
ratify O
it O
before O
20 O
July O
. O

After O
several O
weeks O
of O
negotiations O
, O
both O
formations O
are O
about O
to O
conclude O
an O
agreement O
in O
which O
the O
" O
star O
" O
issue O
, O
according O
to O
Prieto B-PER
, O
has O
been O
the O
increase O
of O
non O
- O
contributory O
pensions O
. O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
they O
have O
agreed O
to O
grant O
from O
July O
" O
a O
minimum O
guarantee O
supplement O
for O
all O
citizens O
who O
have O
recognised O
a O
benefit O
" O
, O
not O
only O
for O
this O
type O
of O
pension O
. O

As O
explained O
, O
an O
allocation O
of O
100 O
million O
pesetas O
will O
be O
made O
available O
for O
this O
year O
so O
that O
" O
those O
citizens O
who O
have O
recognised O
a O
benefit O
, O
are O
called O
as O
they O
are O
called O
, O
have O
a O
supplement O
and O
can O
reach O
a O
minimum O
of O
685,000 O
pesetas O
per O
year O
" O
. O

Prieto B-PER
considered O
that O
" O
we O
are O
increasingly O
overtaking O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
other O
territories O
, O
and O
it O
is O
improved O
to O
quite O
a O
few O
collectives O
" O
, O
while O
the O
MEP O
said O
that O
he O
had O
accepted O
this O
measure O
" O
with O
satisfaction O
" O
. O

Another O
issue O
agreed O
between O
the O
two O
parties O
is O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O
social O
toll O
on O
the O
A-68 B-MISC
motorway O
from O
Altube B-LOC
to O
Areta B-LOC
for O
the O
citizens O
of O
Albuquerque O
. O

Although O
both O
Prieto B-PER
and O
Rabanera B-PER
assured O
that O
they O
are O
still O
in O
talks O
with O
the O
concessionaire O
, O
Autopista B-MISC
Vasco I-MISC
- O
Aragonesa O
, O
the O
Diputación B-ORG
will O
allow O
a O
thirty O
million O
, O
which O
could O
be O
extended O
, O
so O
that O
residents O
in O
the O
valley B-LOC
of I-LOC
Ayala I-LOC
have O
free O
of O
charge O
the O
motorway O
up O
to O
a O
maximum O
of O
20 O
trips O
per O
month O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
ferries O
, O
a O
soft O
fare O
is O
being O
negotiated O
for O
the O
same O
number O
of O
trips O
per O
month O
, O
for O
which O
a O
50 O
% O
reduction O
could O
be O
applied O
. O

Also O
, O
Juan B-PER
Carlos I-PER
Prieto I-PER
highlighted O
the O
increase O
introduced O
in O
the O
Department O
of O
Welfare B-MISC
, O
which O
" O
will O
increase O
by O
more O
than O
12 O
percent O
" O
on O
the O
budget O
of O
the O
previous O
year O
, O
will O
include O
an O

and O
25 O

more O
for O

Prieto B-PER
specified O
that O

" O

The O

about O

At O
10.00 O
a.m. O
a O

alerted O
the O
Mossos B-ORG
that O
from O

which O

A O
regional O
police O
officer O
has O
travelled O
to O
the O
location O
indicated O
by O
the O

after O
checking O
that O
these O

4 O

that O

some O

they O
have O
taken O
them O

After O
investigating O
the O
inside O

the O
packages O
, O
Mossos B-ORG
confirmed O
that O
it O
was O
90 O
kilos O
of O
hashish O
. O

This O
amount O
could O
be O
part O
of O
another O
4,160 O
kilos O
of O
hashish O
that O
workers O
at O
a O
bar O
on O
this O

spotted O
last O
May O

it O
was O

more O
than O
4 O
tonnes O
of O
hashish O
which O
the O
narcotics O
could O
not O
take O
from O
the O
beach O
because O
the O
car O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
transport O
them O
was O
stranded O
in O
the O

According O
to O
the O
investigators O
, O
possibly O
the O
departure O
had O
been O
made O
that O

night O
, O
but O
when O
the O
countermeasures O
of O
the O
car O
in O
the O
sand O
appeared O
, O
the O
drug O

preferred O
to O
flee O

Precisely O
today O

the O

confirmed O
the O

that O
the O
State O

The O
mobile O

Amena B-ORG
has O
decided O
to O
withdraw O
the O
complaint O
it O
filed O
against O
the O
competing O
company O
Airtel B-ORG
for O
an O
alleged O
scam O
, O
and O
which O
motivated O
the O
statement O
yesterday O
in O
the O
court O
, O
as O
charged O
, O
of O
four O
Andalusian O
directors O
of O
the O
second O
of O
them O
. O

Sources O
of O
the O
case O
told O
Efe B-ORG
that O
Amena B-ORG
had O
already O
informed O
the O
instructor O
judge O
of O
this O
fact O
, O
although O
the O
persons O
involved O
are O
not O
yet O
officially O
aware O
of O
this O
since O
the O
matter O
is O
under O
summary O
secrecy O

According O
to O
the O

, O
the O
former O

, O
who O

came O
to O
the O
Sicilian O

yesterday O
to O
appear O
in O
the O
proceedings O
on O

of O
Amena B-ORG
but O
the O
company O
's O
intention O
is O
to O
withdraw O
after O
the O
case O

not O
to O
persist O
in O
the O

In O
these O

the O

time O
to O

of O

. O

Apparently O
, O
Amena B-ORG
's O
decision O
was O
due O
to O
discussions O
between O
the O
two O
companies O

, O
which O
preferred O
to O
resolve O
their O

outside O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party O
: O

The O
medication O
Viagra B-MISC
, O
used O
against O
male O
impotence O
, O
is O
ineffective O
in O
solving O

, O
according O
to O
a O
study O
funded O
by O
the O
pharmaceutical O
company O
that O

The O

Three O
weeks O

, O
a O
team O
of O
researchers O
from O
Boston B-ORG

reported O
that O
Viagra B-MISC
helped O
alleviate O
sexual O
problems O
in O
some O
women O
. O

Viagra B-MISC
has O
proven O
its O
effectiveness O
in O
sexual O
impotence O
of O
some O
men O
because O
it O
increases O
the O
blood O
flow O
in O
the O
penis O
, O
which O
helps O
with O
erection O
. O

The O
Pfizer B-ORG

18 O

55 O
with O
difficulty O
in O
getting O

John B-PER
Bancroft I-PER
, O
director O
of O
the O
Kinsey B-ORG
Institute I-ORG
, O
said O
the O
results O
of O
this O
study O
" O
are O
not O
surprising O
" O
. O

Bancroft B-PER
pointed O
out O
that O
" O
blood O
flow O
is O
crucial O
to O
male O
sexual O
performance O
, O
but O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
relevant O
it O
is O
to O
women O
, O
" O
although O
he O
stressed O
that O
" O
Viagra B-MISC
could O
help O
a O
small O
number O
of O
women O
, O
but O
most O
need O
other O
things O
: O
more O
rest O
, O
a O
better O
relationship O
or O
feel O
better O
about O
themselves O
. O
" O

Now O
Pfizer B-ORG
has O
commissioned O
another O
study O
with O
postmenopausal O
women O
, O
the O
results O
of O
which O
will O
be O
available O
next O

, O
conducted O
an O
experiment O
in O
35 O
women O
, O
aged O
on O
average O
50 O
years O
, O
after O
which O
Viagra B-MISC
was O
found O
to O
benefit O
those O
who O
had O
sexual O
problems O
after O
a O
hysterectomy O
. O

Before O
Pfizer B-ORG
's O
study O
, O
Berman B-PER
said O
that O
" O
before O
we O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
( O
Viagra B-MISC
) O
does O
n't O
work O
, O
we O
have O
to O
limit O
our O
tests O
to O
women O
who O
can O
help O
, O
who O
have O
the O
right O
hormones O
and O
still O
have O
problems O
feeling O
sexual O
excitement O
. O
" O

In O
the O
Berman B-PER
study O
, O
all O
women O
who O
had O
to O
undergo O
uterus O
extinction O
complained O
of O
decreased O
sensations O
during O
sexual O
intercourse O
, O
but O
after O
taking O
Viagra B-MISC
only O
22 O
percent O
had O
the O
same O
complaints O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
study O
, O
35 O
indicated O
that O
they O
had O
lost O
their O
ability O
to O
achieve O
orgasm O
, O
but O
after O
taking O
the O
drug O
, O
only O
16 O
percent O
showed O
the O
same O
disability O
, O
Berman B-PER
said O
. O

The O
percentage O
of O
women O
who O
felt O
pain O
, O
discomfort O
or O
discomfort O
during O
sexual O
intercourse O
fell O
from O
68 O
to O
33 O
percent O
after O
administration O
of O
the O
drug O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
Berman B-PER
believes O
that O
women O
are O
perhaps O
too O
concerned O
about O
sex O
. O

" O
There O
is O
a O
school O
of O
thought O
according O
to O
which O
the O
norms O
by O
which O
we O
measure O
sexuality O
have O
been O
distorted O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
norms O
that O

use O

, O
according O
to O
the O

. O

The O
Olympic O
project O
in O

" O
realistic O
" O
because O
of O
the O
forty O
necessary O
facilities O
there O
are O
already O
thirty O
, O
three O
more O
are O
planned O
although O
the O

only O

that O

These O
data O

August O
. O

The O
mayor O
was O
convinced O
that O
the O
IOC B-ORG
will O
evaluate O
the O
concentration O
of O

because O
it O
reduces O

, O
as O

Monteseirín B-PER
also O
stressed O
that O

, O
athletes O

be O

not O

, O
which O
the O
COI B-ORG
criticized O

Thus O
, O
the O
first O
that O

be O
done O
will O
be O
the O

soil O
, O
where O
the O

to O
act O
in O
the O

Moreno B-PER
presented O
at O
a O
press O
conference O
the O
latest O
data O
of O
surgical O
waiting O
lists O
which O
, O
as O
of O
March O
31 O
, O
was O
comprised O
of O
151.421 O
patients O
, O
compared O
to O
the O
142.000 O
that O
had O
been O
in O
December O
1999 O
. O

According O
to O
Moreno B-PER
's O
data O
, O
the O
waiting O
list O
for O
more O
than O
six O
months O
was O
1,908 O
patients O
( O
513 O
in O
December O
1999 O
) O
and O
the O
average O
delay O
was O
61 O
days O
, O
while O
the O
average O
waiting O
was O
84 O
days O
. O

After O
insisting O
that O
the O
Government B-ORG
's O
intention O
is O
to O
continue O
to O
progressively O
reduce O
the O
waiting O
list O
, O
for O
which O
a O
working O
group O
has O
already O
been O
set O
up O
, O
Moreno B-PER
set O
the O
goal O
that O
the O
average O
delay O
should O
not O
exceed O
55 O
days O
and O
that O
no O
one O
should O
wait O
more O
than O
six O
months O
for O
surgery O
. O

For O
Moreno B-PER
, O
the O
main O
reasons O
that O
have O
influenced O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
waiting O
list O
( O
which O
has O
gone O
from O
142,000 O
that O
was O
in O
December O
to O
151.421 O
of O
March O
2000 O
) O
are O
the O
increase O
in O
surgical O
activity O
, O
which O
brings O
out O
greater O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
coincidence O
with O
other O
economic O
facts O
, O
such O
as O
holiday O
periods O
. O

" O
I O
can O
not O
say O
that O
I O
am O
satisfied O
with O
61 O
days O
of O
average O
delay O
, O
nor O
with O
any O
delay O
" O
, O
Moreno B-PER
pointed O
out O
, O
who O
nevertheless O
specified O
that O
hospitals O
need O
to O
have O
a O
certain O
period O
to O
be O
able O
to O
schedule O
surgical O
interventions O
. O

It O
also O
pointed O
out O
that O
much O
of O
the O
decline O
in O
waiting O
lists O
that O
has O
occurred O
in O
recent O
years O
is O
due O
to O
the O
efforts O
of O
hospitals O
with O
the O
increase O
in O
surgical O
activity O
that O
in O
the O
period O
January O
- O
April O
increased O
by O
5.7 O
percent O
, O
which O
represents O
11,400 O
more O
interventions O
than O
in O
the O
same O
period O
of O
1999 O
. O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
it O
pointed O
out O
that O
in O
the O
period O
January O
- O
April O
4.619 O
patients O
were O
treated O
in O
late O
activity O
, O
of O
which O
1.151 O
were O
operated O
on O
in O
April O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Insalud B-ORG
expressed O
his O
wish O
that O
patients O
on O
the O
waiting O
list O
who O
have O
been O
waiting O
for O
more O
than O
90 O
days O
should O
be O
able O
to O
choose O
the O
Insalud B-ORG
centre O
in O
which O
they O
wish O
to O
undergo O
surgery O
and O
that O
they O
should O
not O
be O
transferred O
directly O
, O
and O
without O
choice O
, O
to O
another O
hospital O
. O

the O

This O
is O
why O

Adega B-ORG
points O
out O
that O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
results O
of O
the O
forest O
inventory O
to O
learn O
about O
the O
" O
huge O
proliferation O

of O

, O
which O
Galician O
environmentalists O
have O
been O
denouncing O
for O
years O

recall O
that O
they O
presented O
in O
Parliament B-ORG
in O
88 O
a O
forest O
legislative O
initiative O
that O
was O
rejected O
. O

Regardless O
of O
whether O
it O
considers O
this O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
eucalyptus O
subsidy O
to O
be O
" O
a O
further O
step O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
" O
, O
Adega B-ORG
says O
it O
is O
" O
totally O
insufficient O
and O
clearly O
lacking O
in O
objectives O
" O
. O

This O
association O
says O
that O
the O
increase O
in O
eucalyptus O
plantations O
responds O
to O
more O
motivations O
than O
aid O
, O
such O
as O
the O
" O
huge O
pressure O
from O
cellulose O
plants O
" O
, O
or O
the O
" O
forced O
abandonment O
" O
and O
also O
subsidised O
" O
of O
farms O

which O
end O
up O
devoting O
the O
land O
to O
this O
species O

" O
Well O

the O
department B-ORG

points O
out O
Adega B-ORG

of O
the O
return O
of O

of O

, O
which O

a O
private O
Swiss O

Guirao B-PER
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
first O
one O
lies O
in O
linking O
the O
theme O
that O
was O
of O
interest O
to O
Picasso B-PER
in O
the O
1930s O
with O
his O
concern O
for O
Goya B-PER

work O
, O
while O
the O
second O

work O

first O
cover O
" O
very O
difficult O
to O
find O
on O
the O
market O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
" O
. O

So O
far O
the O
director O
of O
the O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
announced O
this O
initiative O
after O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
exhibition O
of O
Jiri B-PER
Georg I-PER
Dokoupil I-PER
in O
the O
Palace B-LOC
of I-LOC
Velázquez I-LOC
del O
Retiro B-LOC
when O
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
informants O
made O
a O
balance O
sheet O
of O
its O
management O
. O

He O
noted O
that O
in O
the O
nearly O
six O
years O
that O
he O
has O
remained O
in O
front O
of O
the O
center O
has O
had O
the O
luck O
to O
always O
have O
" O
the O
support O
of O
the O
ministry O
, O
the O
patronage O
and O
above O
all O
, O
a O
team O
of O
professionals O
that O
has O
been O
up O
to O
the O
standard O
of O
a O
museum O
in O
constant O
evolution O
" O
. O

This O
has O
enabled O
him O
to O
carry O
forward O
a O
project O
that O
began O
with O
his O
appointment O
by O
the O
Socialist O
Minister O
of O
Culture B-MISC
Carmen B-PER
Alborch I-PER
and O
did O
not O
stop O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
PP B-ORG
in O
power O
and O
the O
subsequent O
appointments O
of O
Esperanza B-PER
Aguirre I-PER
and O
Mariano B-PER
Rajoy I-PER
as O
Ministers O
of O
Education B-MISC
and I-MISC
Culture I-MISC
. O

His O
sympathy O
was O
especially O
with O
the O
former O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
for O
Culture B-MISC
, O
Miguel B-PER
Angel I-PER
Cortés I-PER
, O
who O
always O
supported O
the O
initiatives O
of O
the O
museum O
, O
although O
Guirao B-PER
felt O
that O
" O
more O
than O
personal O
relations O
, O
the O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
have O
projects O
" O
. O

So O
far O
the O
director O
of O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
insisted O
that O
he O
has O
never O
had O
pressure O
from O
the O
administration O
and O
has O
received O
support O
that O
has O
translated O
into O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
economic O
means O
. O

He O
recalled O
that O
for O
this O
year O
the O
ordinary O
budget O
of O
the O
museum O
increased O
from O
400 O
million O
. O
1.500 O
million O
and O
in O
recent O
years O
the O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
has O
had O
many O
economic O
resources O
, O
both O
by O
way O
of O
budget O
and O
by O
way O
of O
grants O
( O
tax O
payment O
) O
, O
to O
buy O
quality O
works O
. O

This O
allowed O
him O
to O
complete O
the O
gaps O
in O
the O
collection O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
works O
by O
Juan B-PER
Gris I-PER
, O
Miró B-PER
and O
Picasso B-PER
and O
to O
start O
the O
project O
of O
expansion O
of O
the O
facilities O
. O

Guirao B-PER
believed O
that O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
new O
team O
in O
the O
museum O
there O
will O
be O
continuity O
in O
the O
recovery O
of O
significant O
Spanish O
artists O
, O
although O
he O
considered O
that O
this O
is O
a O
approach O
that O
corresponds O
to O
his O
successor O
. O

The O
director O
of O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
, O
who O
considers O
himself O
lucky O
to O
have O
been O
able O
to O
develop O
his O
project O
and O
does O
not O
feel O
frustrated O
by O
his O
failure O
, O
explained O
that O
the O
key O
to O
his O
management O
has O
been O
" O
work O
and O
let O
his O
team O
work O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
one O
of O
the O
challenges O
now O
facing O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
is O
the O
increase O
in O
human O
resources O
, O
" O
very O
necessary O
because O
the O
museum O
works O
thanks O
to O
the O
work O
and O
generosity O
of O
the O
people O
" O
. O

As O
for O
the O
most O
complicated O
moments O
lived O
during O
his O
management O
, O
he O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
first O
was O
his O
arrival O
at O
the O
center O
, O
with O
the O
resignation O
of O
several O
members O
of O
the O
management O
and O
the O
other O

In O

today O
, O
the O
day O
after O

Pujol B-PER
stressed O
that O
to O
avoid O
" O
fathers O
" O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
follow O
the O
advice O
of O
the O
Moroccan O
writer O
Tahar B-PER
Ben I-PER
Jelloun I-PER
and O
invest O
in O
the O
poor O
countries O
to O
develop O
so O
that O
their O
inhabitants O
do O
not O
have O
to O
emigrate O
. O

" O
The O
best O
immigration O
law O
, O
the O
most O
anti O
- O
racist O
, O
would O
be O
for O
Spain B-ORG
and O
France B-ORG
to O
invest O
in O
the O
Maghreb B-LOC
and O
create O
jobs O
in O
Morocco B-LOC
so O
that O
no O
one O
is O
forced O
to O
emigrate O
" O
, O
said O
the O
Catalan O
president O
quoting O
the O
writer O
. O

According O
to O
Pujol B-PER
, O
" O
the O
hypocrisy O
of O
some O
so O
- O
called O
' O
progressive O
' O
parties O
that O
wave O
the O
flag O
of O
solidarity O
with O
immigrants O
while O
opposing O
investments O
in O
North O
Africa B-LOC
because O
they O
jeopardise O
local O
jobs O
" O
should O
be O
ended O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
he O
considered O
that O
" O
a O
vigorous O
policy O
of O
investment O
in O
the O
Maghreb B-LOC
could O
only O
encourage O
European O
economic O
expansion O
in O
the O
Mediterranean O
region O
" O
. O

As O
regards O
the O
benefits O
of O
immigration O
for O
low O
birth O
rates O
in O
Western O
European O
societies O
, O
he O
said O
that O
" O
they O
are O
indisputable O
" O
because O
they O
contribute O
to O
" O
increasing O
the O
active O
population O
and O
thus O
facilitating O
the O
maintenance O
of O
the O
collective O
well O
- O
being O
" O
. O

However O
, O
it O
warned O
that O
these O
positive O
effects O
" O
are O
lost O
in O
part O
due O
to O
the O
overflow O
of O
migration O
flows O
" O
. O

I O
also O
predict O
that O
' O
one O
of O
the O
most O
worrying O
problems O
is O
religious O
fundamentalism O
' O
which O
' O
has O
an O
impact O
on O
immigration O
itself O
but O
also O
on O
the O
international O
coexistence O
of O
the O
two O
shores O
of O
the O
Mediterranean B-MISC
' O
. O

To O
face O
it O
, O
according O
to O
Pujol B-PER
, O
" O
we O
must O
believe O
the O
experts O
on O
the O
Maghreb B-LOC
when O
they O
tell O
us O
that O
Islamic O
integrity O
will O
lose O
strength O
with O
economic O
prosperity O
" O
, O
since O
" O
it O
only O
grows O
with O
frustration O
and O
with O
the O
inability O
to O
obtain O
material O
goods O
" O
, O
so O
" O
economic O
well O
- O
being O
would O
be O
the O
best O
antidote O
to O
religious O
extremism O
" O
. O

He O
explained O
that O
the O
aim O
in O
the O
societies O
receiving O
immigrants O
is O
" O
social O
integration O
, O
coexistence O
and O
respect O
for O
cultural O
peculiarities O
" O
, O
which O
requires O
" O
cultural O
porosity O
" O
, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party O
: O

The O
patronage B-ORG
of O
the O
Museo B-ORG
Reina I-ORG
Sofía I-ORG
today O
gave O
the O
go O
- O
ahead O
to O
the O
appointment O
of O
Juan B-PER
Manuel I-PER
Bonet I-PER
as O
the O
new O
director O
of O
the O
centre O
in O
place O
of O
José B-PER
Guirao I-PER
, O
who O
resigns O
with O
the O
acquisition O
of O
two O
picassos O
valued O
at O
1.800 O
million O
pesetas O
. O

The O
patronage B-ORG
session O
was O
chaired O
by O
the O
Minister O
of O
Education O
, O
Culture B-MISC
and I-MISC
Sports I-MISC
, O
Pilar B-PER
del I-PER
Castillo I-PER
, O
who O
will O
take O
Bonet B-PER
's O
appointment O
to O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Ministers I-ORG
next O
2 O
June O
. O

The O
paintings O
of O
Picasso B-PER
, O
whose O
administrative O
processing O
is O
in O
progress O
, O
are O
the O
dead O
nature O
" O
Three B-MISC
cranios I-MISC
" O
, O
painted O
in O
the O
1930s O
and O
bought O
to O
Marina B-PER
Picasso I-PER
, O
granddaughter O
of O
the O
Malaganese O
artist O
, O
and O
a O
portrait O
of O
Fernande B-PER
, O
of O
1910 O
, O
which O
has O
sold O
a O
private O
Swiss O
collector O
. O

Guirao B-PER
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
first O
one O
lies O
in O
linking O
the O
theme O
that O
was O
of O
interest O
to O
Picasso B-PER
in O
the O
1930s O
with O
his O
concern O
for O
Goya B-PER
's O
work O
, O
while O
the O
second O
one O
is O
a O
work O
of O
the O
first O
cover O
" O
very O
difficult O
to O
find O
on O
the O
market O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
" O
. O

So O
far O
the O
director O
of O
the O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
announced O
this O
initiative O
after O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
exhibition O
of O
Jiri B-PER
Georg I-PER
Dokoupil I-PER
in O
the O
Palacio B-LOC
de I-LOC
Velázquez I-LOC
del O
Retiro B-LOC
when O
, O
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
informants O
, O
made O
a O
balance O
sheet O
of O
its O
management O
. O

He O
noted O
that O
in O
the O
nearly O
six O
years O
he O
has O
been O
at O
the O
front O
of O
the O
center O
has O
had O
the O
luck O
to O
always O
have O
" O
the O
support O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
, O
the O
patronage B-ORG
and O
above O
all O
, O
a O
team O
of O
professionals O
who O
has O
been O
up O
to O
the O
standard O
of O
a O
museum O
in O
constant O
evolution O
" O
. O

This O
has O
enabled O
him O
to O
carry O
forward O
a O
project O
that O
began O
with O
his O
appointment O
by O
the O
Socialist O
Minister O
of O
Culture B-MISC
Carmen B-PER
Alborch I-PER
and O
did O
not O
stop O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
PP B-ORG
in O
power O
and O
the O
subsequent O
appointments O
of O
Esperanza B-PER
Aguirre I-PER
and O
Mariano B-PER
Rajoy I-PER
as O
Ministers O
of O
Education B-MISC
and I-MISC
Culture I-MISC
. O

His O
sympathy O
was O
especially O
with O
the O
former O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
for O
Culture B-MISC
, O
Miguel B-PER
Angel I-PER
Cortés I-PER
, O
who O
always O
supported O
the O
initiatives O
of O
the O
museum O
, O
although O
Guirao B-PER
felt O
that O
" O
more O
than O
personal O
relations O
, O
the O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
have O
projects O
" O
. O

So O
far O
the O
director O
of O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
has O
insisted O
that O
he O
has O
never O
had O
pressure O
from O
the O
administration B-ORG
and O
has O
received O
support O
which O
has O
resulted O
in O
an O
increase O
in O
economic O
means O
. O

He O
recalled O
that O
for O
this O
year O
the O
ordinary O
budget O
of O
the O
museum O
increased O
from O
400 O
million O
. O
1.500 O
million O
and O
in O
recent O
years O
the O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
has O
had O
many O
economic O
resources O
, O
both O
by O
way O
of O
budget O
and O
by O
way O
of O
grants O
( O
tax O
payment O
) O
, O
to O
buy O
quality O
works O
. O

This O
allowed O
him O
to O
complete O
the O
gaps O
in O
the O
collection O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
works O
by O
Juan B-PER
Gris I-PER
, O
Miró B-PER
and O
Picasso B-PER
and O
to O
start O
the O
project O
of O
expansion O
of O
the O
facilities O
. O

Guirao B-PER
believed O
that O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
new O
team O
in O
the O
museum O
there O
will O
be O
continuity O
in O
the O
recovery O
of O
significant O
Spanish O
artists O
, O
although O
he O
considered O
that O
this O
is O
a O
approach O
that O
corresponds O
to O
his O
successor O
. O

The O
director O
of O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
, O
who O
considers O
himself O
lucky O
to O
have O
been O
able O
to O
develop O
his O
project O
and O
does O
not O
feel O
frustrated O
by O
his O
failure O
, O
explained O
that O
the O
key O
to O
his O
management O
has O
been O
" O
work O
and O
let O
his O
team O
work O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
one O
of O
the O
challenges O
now O
facing O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
is O
the O
increase O
in O
human O
resources O
, O
" O
very O
necessary O
because O
the O
museum O
works O
thanks O
to O
the O
work O
and O
generosity O
of O
the O
people O
" O
. O

As O
for O
the O
most O
complicated O
moments O
lived O
during O
his O
management O
, O
he O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
first O
was O
his O
arrival O
at O
the O
center O
, O
with O
the O
resignation O
of O
several O
members O
of O
the O
management O
and O
the O
other O
occurred O
with O
the O
controversy O
raised O
by O
the O
request O
for O
the O
loan O
of O
the O
Guernica B-MISC
, O
resolved O
" O
with O
a O
professional O
behaviour O

The O

Martínez B-PER
Díez I-PER
complained O
that O
Greek O
classical O

" O
If O

that O

, O
today O
, O
Tuesday O
, O
advised O
EU B-ORG
governments O
to O
speed O
up O
cuts O
in O
their O
public O
deficits O
and O
move O
ahead O
with O
the O
budgetary O

target O
by O
2002 O
. O

In O
presenting O
a O
report O
on O
public O
finances O
in O
the O
EU B-ORG
, O
Solbes B-PER
insisted O
that O
if O
governments O
achieve O
the O
balance O
by O
2002 O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
year O
later O
as O
the O
majority O
envisages O
, O
they O
will O
increase O
in O
several O
respects O
the O
margin O
needed O
to O
make O
tax O
cuts O
that O
stimulate O
growth O
and O
create O
jobs O
. O

This O
margin O
will O
also O
serve O
, O
to O
alleviate O
the O
burden O
they O
will O
have O
to O
bear O
budgets O
due O
to O
the O
ageing O
population O
, O
Solbes B-PER
said O
. O

" O
The O
more O
the O
deficit O
is O
reduced O
now O
, O
the O
greater O
the O
margin O
will O
be O
" O
to O
bear O
that O
burden O
, O
although O
for O
almost O
all O
states B-ORG
" O
will O
not O
be O
enough O
" O
and O
" O
will O
also O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
reform O
of O

" O
, O
he O
said O
. O

The O
European O
Commissioner O
underlined O
that O
the O
impact O
of O
economic O
growth O
over O
the O
past O
two O
years O
should O
be O
used O
to O
accelerate O
this O
deficit O
reduction O
, O
which O
has O
slowed O
down O
over O
the O
last O
two O
years O
. O

Solbes B-PER
explained O
that O
accelerating O
fiscal O
consolidation O
is O
even O
" O
more O
inexorable O
" O
at O
a O
time O
like O
the O
present O
one O
, O
characterized O
by O
" O
strong O
activity O
in O
the O
private O
sector O
" O
. O

If O
European O
governments O
do O
not O
reduce O
the O
budget O
deficit O
at O
the O
moment O
and O
through O
public O
spending O
or O
tax O
cuts O
stimulate O
demand O
even O
more O
, O
" O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
do O
is O
put O
more O
fire O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
increase O
inflation O
and O
cut O
the O
period O
of O
growth O
, O
" O
Solbes B-PER
explained O
. O

" O
This O
is O
exactly O
what O
we O
've O
done O
other O
times O
and O
exactly O
the O
opposite O
of O
what O
the O
Federal B-ORG

( O
American O
) O
did O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

Solbes B-PER
stressed O
that O
while O
the O
priority O
must O
be O
to O
end O
the O
public O
deficit O
, O
tax O
cuts O
or O
public O
spending O
restructurings O
can O
always O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
parallel O
. O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
tax O
cuts O
should O
be O
aimed O
at O
reducing O
non O
- O
wage O
labour O
costs O
, O
while O
public O
spending O
should O
" O
improve O
its O
quality O
" O
by O
focusing O
on O
more O
profitable O
investments O
and O
training O
of O
human O
capital O
. O

With O
a O
simple O
reduction O
in O
labour O
costs O
equivalent O
to O
1 O
% O
of O
gross B-MISC
domestic I-MISC
product I-MISC
( O
GDP B-MISC
) O
, O
the O
report O
points O
out O
that O
between O
750 O
000 O
and O
1.5 O
million O
jobs O
could O
be O
created O
in O
ten O

industrial O
production O

grow O
by O
0.8 O
percent O
at O
the O

to O
the O
previous O

which O
will O
accumulate O
an O
increase O
of O
4.2 O

Another O
positive O
data O
from O
this O
study O
, O
which O
has O
been O
made O
public O
today O
, O
is O
the O
3.8 O

In O
May O
, O
the O
average O
daily O
production O
is O
increasing O
by O
4.2 O
percent O
in O

terms O
, O
reflecting O
a O
working O

more O
than O
in O

According O
to O
Confindustria B-ORG

in O
May O
will O
be O
9.9 O
percent O
more O
than O
in O
that O
month O
of O
1999 O
. O

This O
is O
justified O
by O
the O
rise O
in O
domestic O
demand O
( O
+7.1 O
percent O
) O
and O
external O
demand O
( O
+13.2 O

the O

The O
industrial O

that O

are O

" O
, O
Tur B-PER

The O

an O

themselves O

in O

get O
a O
glimpse O
into O
the O
life O
of O

and O
held O
this O
evening O
in O
Navia B-LOC
a O
meeting O
with O

in O
order O

that O

García B-PER
Valledor I-PER
took O
advantage O
of O
the O
visit O
to O
announce O
in O
Navia B-LOC
that O
they O
would O
present O
two O
parliamentary O
initiatives O
, O
one O
of O
which O
aimed O
to O
ask O
the O
regional O
government B-ORG
a O
" O
strong O
commitment O
" O
of O
the O
one O
approved O
by O
the O
Asturian B-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
asking O
for O
a O
negotiation O
to O
redefine O
the O
road O
map O
and O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
part O
urge O
the O
government B-ORG
to O
put O
in O
place O
all O
jurisdictional O
actions O
that O
proceed O
if O
the O
case O
is O
reached O
. O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party B-ORG
take O
all O
necessary O
measures O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
right O
to O
adequate O
housing O
is O
guaranteed O
in O
the O
State B-ORG
party O
's O
domestic O
legislation O
. O

The O
initiative O
is O
based O
on O
the O
lack O
of O
dialogue O
and O
the O
central O
government B-ORG
's O
refusal O
to O
make O
any O
changes O
to O
the O
route O
, O
so O
it O
considers O
it O
important O
for O
the O
Principality B-ORG
to O
commit O
itself O
to O
maintaining O
its O
position O
on O
this O
issue O
, O
as O
already O
stated O
last O
October O
. O

The O
other O
proposal O
revolves O
around O
the O
agricultural O
field O
, O
being O
interested O
in O
this O
political O
training O
by O
knowing O
first O
- O
hand O
the O
Rural B-MISC
Development I-MISC
Plan I-MISC
, O
and O
accusing O
the O
Executive B-ORG
of O
Vicente B-PER
Alvarez I-PER
Areces I-PER
of O
not O
reporting O
on O
it O
. O

For O
IU B-ORG
, O
the O
plan B-MISC
" O
is O
absolutely O
unknown O
" O
and O
point O
out O
that O
in O
the O
Asturian O
government B-ORG
" O
has O
not O
given O
any O
information O
and O
it O
is O
not O
known O
where O
the O
approaches O
occur O
" O
. O

“ O
It O
gives O
the O
impression O
that O
agricultural O
policy O
has O
been O
contagious O
with O
the O
situation O
of O
paralysis O
and O
inactivity O
that O
accompanies O
the O
government B-ORG
of O
the O
community O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
information O
is O
widespread O
, O
” O
said O
Valledor B-PER
. O

He O
said O
, O
lastly O
, O
that O
this O
situation O
is O
" O
troubling O
" O
even O
more O
if O
one O
considers O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
Rural B-ORG

that O

In O

at O
the O

no O

about O

it O
will O
be O
very O
difficult O
for O

. O

Also O
, O
the O
low O
volume O
of O

that O

been O
recorded O
in O

increases O
the O

Ramon B-PER

the O
PP B-ORG
that O
the O
fact O
of O
using O
" O
the O

technique O
of O
a O

perhaps O
not O
the O
most O
appropriate O
" O

he O
added O
that O

his O

According O
to O
the O
writer O
, O
this O
is O
a O
theory O
that O
is O
deeply O
rooted O
in O
Spanish O
society O
, O
which O
does O
not O
realize O
that O
the O

project O
of O
the O
book O
, O
published O
by O
" O

" O
, O
began O
many O
years O

and O
was O
part O
of O
two O
volumes O
that O

to O
be O

in O
1972 O

the O
year O

The O
second O
volume O
, O
in O
which O
the O
songs O
were O
grouped O
by O
their O
thematic O
diversification O
, O
was O
suspended O
due O
to O
the O
difficulties O
put O
by O
the O
General B-ORG
Society I-ORG

, O
so O
that O
the O

Vázquez B-PER

had O
to O
wait O
almost O
thirty O
years O
to O
go O
out O

With O
this O

, O
Vázquez B-PER

concludes O
his O
work O
of O
inventing O
the O
roots O
of O
a O
sentimentality O
that O
is O
reflected O

shown O
in O

, O
said O
the O
author O
during O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
book O
. O

For O
Vázquez B-PER
Montalban I-PER
what O
was O
interesting O
was O
" O
the O
use O
made O
by O
the O
audience O
receiving O
the O
song O
, O
which O
could O
have O
in O
it O
the O
same O
repercussions O
as O
the O
poetry O
cultivates O
" O
, O
as O
happens O
with O
" O
Do O

which O
is O
a O
translation O
of O

of O
the O

of O

Cantor O
of O

, O
" O
but O
translated O
into O
the O
popular O
language O
" O
. O

In O
an O
era O
, O
which O
goes O
back O
to O
the O
1940s O
, O
in O
which O
there O
was O
no O
mass O
culture O
were O
the O
coplas O
, O
influenced O
by O
tradition O
, O
responsible O
for O
reflecting O
that O
sentimental O
memory O
. O

" O
It O
is O
a O
closed O
and O
finished O
time O
" O
, O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
author O
who O
remembered O
that O
subjects O
such O
as O
" O
My B-MISC
Jaca I-MISC
" O
were O
heard O
during O
the O
civil O
war O
on O
both O
sides O
, O
" O
a O
song O
that O
had O
been O
born O
twenty O
years O
before O
. O

Today O
the O
songs O
, O
except O
for O
exceptions O
, O
last O
two O
months O
" O
. O

The O
youngest O
and O
readers O
of O
the O
21st O
century O
will O
be O
able O
, O
through O
this O
songwriter O
, O
to O
remember O
a O
part O
of O
Spanish O
popular O
culture O
in O
the O
preformation O
phase O
of O
the O
market O
of O
the O
cultural O
industry O
. O

Although O
at O
present O
the O
copla O
is O
still O
interpreted O
" O
to O
the O
tonadillera O
is O
not O
supplied O
with O
songs O
that O
endure O
. O

They O
interpret O
inherited O
compositions O
in O
a O
repertoire O
made O
to O
their O
own O
taste O
. O

The O
copla O
is O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
has O
not O
come O
back O
because O
it O
has O
been O
closed O
down O
by O
the O
great O
cultural O
record O
industry O
that O
has O
not O
let O
it O
prosper O
" O
. O

If O
in O
previous O
years O
songs O
responded O
to O
a O
culture O
that O
was O
driven O
by O
politics O
, O
today O
the O
market O
is O
the O
one O
that O
drives O
that O
culture O
, O
" O
now O
we O
are O
in O
a O
regime O
of O
monoculture O
in O
the O
song O
" O

today O
, O

advised O

to O
speed O
up O

in O
their O
public O

and O
move O
ahead O
with O
the O

In O
presenting O
a O
report O
on O
public O
finances O
in O
the O
EU B-ORG
, O
Solbes B-PER
insisted O
that O
if O
governments O
achieve O
the O
balance O
by O
2002 O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
year O
later O
as O
the O
majority O
envisages O
, O
they O
will O
increase O
in O
several O
respects O
the O
margin O
needed O
to O
make O
tax O
cuts O
that O
stimulate O
growth O
and O
create O

. O

This O
margin O
will O
also O
serve O
, O
to O
alleviate O
the O
burden O
they O
will O
have O
to O
bear O
budgets O
due O
to O
the O
ageing O
population O
, O
Solbes B-PER
said O
. O

" O
The O
more O
the O
deficit O
is O
reduced O
now O
, O
the O
greater O
the O
margin O
will O
be O
" O
to O
bear O
that O
burden O
, O
although O
for O
almost O
all O
states O
" O

not O
be O

" O

also O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O

" O
, O
he O
said O

The O
European O
Commissioner O
underlined O
that O
the O
impact O
of O
economic O
growth O
over O
the O
past O
two O
years O
should O
be O
used O
to O
accelerate O
this O
deficit O
reduction O
, O
which O
has O
slowed O
down O
over O
the O
last O
two O
years O
. O

Solbes B-PER
explained O
that O
accelerating O
fiscal O
consolidation O
is O
even O
" O
more O
inexorable O
" O
at O
a O
time O
like O
the O
present O
one O
, O
characterized O
by O
" O
strong O
activity O
in O
the O
private O
sector O
" O
. O

If O
European O
governments O
do O
not O
reduce O
the O
budget O
deficit O
at O
the O
moment O
and O
through O
public O
spending O
or O
tax O
cuts O
stimulate O
demand O
even O
more O
, O
" O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
do O
is O
put O
more O
fire O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
increase O
inflation O
and O
cut O
the O
period O
of O
growth O
, O
" O
Solbes B-PER
explained O
. O

" O
This O
is O
exactly O
what O
we O

done O

exactly O
the O
opposite O
of O
what O
the O

did O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
" O
he O
added O

Solbes B-PER
stressed O
that O
while O
the O
priority O
must O
be O
to O
end O
the O
public O
deficit O
, O
tax O
cuts O
or O
public O
spending O
restructurings O
can O
always O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
parallel O
. O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
tax O
cuts O
should O
be O
aimed O
at O
reducing O
non O
- O
wage O
labour O
costs O
, O
while O
public O

should O
" O
improve O
its O
quality O
" O
by O
focusing O
on O
more O
profitable O

and O
training O
of O

With O
a O
simple O
reduction O
in O

costs O
equivalent O
to O
1 O
% O
of O

( O

, O
the O
report O
points O
out O
that O
between O

Mariano B-PER
Rajoy I-PER
appeared O

which O
he O
pointed O
out O
should O
apply O
in O
all O

" O
Logic O
, O
wisdom O

common O

says O
that O

that O

are O

said O
Rajoy B-PER

also O
considered O
the O
possibility O

acknowledged O
that O

him O
" O

He O
assured O
that O
he O
did O
not O
share O
the O
idea O
advanced O
by O
the O

PNV B-ORG
that O
it O
should O

After O

the O
government B-ORG

intention O
to O
seek O
consensus O
on O
these O
kinds O
of O
issues O
, O
Rajoy B-PER
asked O
for O
the O
support O
of O
all O
groups O
to O
agree O
on O
issues O
that O
- O
as O
he O
said O
- O
" O
do O
not O
give O
or O
withdraw O
votes O
, O
" O
but O
that O
a O
lack O
of O

" O
does O
not O
contribute O
to O
the O
credit O
of O

, O
" O
he O
said O
after O
recalling O
that O
the O

The O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
decided O
to O
open O
the O
case O
against O
the O
tax O
aid O
schemes O
established O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
Navarre B-LOC
on O
14 O
July O
1999 O
and O
, O
although O
the O
decision O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
immediate O
condemnation O
of O
those O
schemes O
, O
it O
can O
in O
theory O
lead O
to O
the O
obligation O
to O
refund O
the O
aid O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
Brussels B-ORG
made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
did O
not O
question O
the O
fiscal O
competences O
that O
both O
communities O
have O
thanks O
to O
the O
Statute B-MISC
of I-MISC
Guernica I-MISC
and O
the O
Statute B-MISC
of I-MISC
Navarra I-MISC
, O
but O
some O
measures O
of O
its O
regimes O
which O
it O
considered O
" O
discriminatory O
" O
and O
incompatible O
with O
European O
rules O
of O
free O
competition O
. O

The O
then O
Commissioner O
for O
Competition B-MISC
, O
Karel B-PER
van I-PER
Miert I-PER
, O
argued O
that O
aid O
to O
the O
Basque O
and O
Navy O
had O
the O
characteristics O
of O
" O
State B-ORG
aid O
" O
and O
" O
could O
be O
considered O
illegal O
" O
since O
" O
it O
is O
financed O
from O
public O
resources O
, O
favours O
certain O
companies O
, O
distorts O
competition O
and O
affects O

between O
Member O

" O
. O

Against O
this O
view O
of O
the O
Commission B-ORG
, O
President O
Navarro O
said O
today O
that O
tax O
aid O
from O
his O
community O
" O
in O
no O
case O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
state B-ORG
aid O
, O
since O
the O
four O
cases O
in O
which O
companies O
have O
opted O
for O
this O
type O
of O
tax O
aid O
have O
been O
able O
to O
deduct O
from O
corporate O
tax O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
million O
pesetas O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
shared O
that O
amount O
with O
the O
528 O
million O
pesetas O
that O
, O
he O
said O
, O
those O
same O
companies O
could O
have O
saved O
if O
they O
had O
opted O
for O
direct O
aid O
to O
investment O
and O
employment O
on O
fixed O
assets O
: O
" O
but O
as O
our O
tax O
aid O
on O
corporate O
tax O
exemptions O
are O
incompatible O
with O
direct O
aid O
, O
they O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
so O
and O
have O
clearly O
seen O
themselves O
disadvantaged O
" O

Sanz B-PER
added O
that O
, O
with O
the O
announcement O
of O
the O
repeal O
of O
the O

, O
he O
hoped O
that O
the O

take O
the O

his O
theory O

the O

characterized O

" O
the O

" O
who O
have O
come O
down O

some O
incorporation O

two O

because O
they O
come O
by O
playing O
several O
years O
in O
Second B-MISC

But O
what O
I O
have O
very O
clear O
is O
that O
at O
First B-MISC
we O
have O
to O
raise O
those O
who O
have O
lowered O
us O
more O
certain O
challenges O
, O
because O
there O
will O
be O
some O
that O
will O
have O
to O
go O
for O
the O
economy O
of O
the O
club O

Zambrano B-PER
offered O
his O
vision O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC

the O
recipe O
that O
must O
apply O
to O
Atlético B-ORG
to O
return O
in O
one O
year O
to O
the O
First B-MISC

" O
In O
Second B-MISC

first O
you O

then O
play O
football O
, O
while O
in O
First B-MISC

you O
have O
to O
play O
football O
and O
then O
fight O
. O

I O
think O
Atlético B-ORG
will O
not O
cost O
you O
to O
join O

it O

both O

The O
Committee O

The O
President O

of I-ORG
Business I-ORG
Organizations I-ORG
( O
CEOE B-ORG
) O
, O
José B-PER
María I-PER
Cuevas I-PER
, O
said O
today O
that O
Spain B-ORG
must O
be O
the O
first O
country O
to O
offer O
solutions O
" O
if O
we O
do O
not O

During O
his O
speech O
to O
the O
CEOE B-MISC
General I-MISC
Assembly I-MISC
held O
today O
in O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
the O
CEO O
President O
said O
that O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
imminent O
globalisation O
and O
internationalisation O
of O
the O
economy O
, O
the O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG
" O
has O
before O
it O
as O
many O
opportunities O
as O
dangers O
" O
. O

" O
The O
reference O
is O
the O
USA B-ORG
" O
, O
whose O
economic O
growth O
, O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
Cuevas B-PER
, O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Berlin B-MISC
Wall I-MISC
which O
caused O
the O
practice O
of O
disappearance O
of O
communism O
and O
the O
entry O
of O
many O
of O
these O
countries O
into O
the O
market O
economy O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
possibility O
that O
North O
America B-ORG
invested O
in O
the O
civilian O
sphere O
what O
was O
previously O
destined O
for O
the O
military O
. O

Outside O
this O
framework O
of O
global O
prosperity O
there O
are O
countries O
like O
Africans O
who O
are O
unable O
to O
join O
it O
and O
whose O
endemic O
ills O
are O
, O
according O
to O
Cuevas B-PER
, O
" O
tribalism O
, O
delay O
and O
continuing O
wars O
" O
. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
he O
recalled O
that O
more O
than O
six O
hundred O
companies O
have O
invested O
in O
Morocco B-LOC
in O
recent O
years O
and O
assured O
that O
" O
the O
economic O
development O
of O
our O
southern O
neighbours O
is O
the O
best O
way O
to O
avoid O
excessive O
immigration O
flows O
" O
. O

For O
the O
CEOE B-ORG
president O
, O
globalization O
is O
" O
the O
great O
hope O
of O
the O
underdeveloped O
world O
, O
" O
although O
he O
specified O
that O
true O
globalization O
" O
that O
is O
economic O
" O
will O
not O
exist O
without O
the O
liberalization O
of O
world O
trade O
, O
" O
a O
very O
distant O
goal O
, O
" O
despite O
the O
recent O
entry O
of O
China B-ORG
into O
the O
World B-ORG
Trade I-ORG
Organization I-ORG
( O
WTO B-ORG
) O
" O
is O
a O
very O
important O
step O
. O
" O

Therefore O
, O
Cuevas B-PER
strongly O
criticized O
the O
anti O
- O
capitalist O
movements O
given O
that O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
the O
peoples O
of O
Mysore O
will O
not O
move O
forward O
without O
entering O
the O
market O
economy O
, O
receive O
foreign O
investment O
, O
guarantee O
them O
with O
democratic O
political O
systems O
and O
develop O
their O
industrial O
capacities O
and O
their O
services O
sectors O
" O
. O

Faced O
with O
this O
problem O
, O
he O
said O
, O
the O
EU B-ORG
" O
does O
not O
play O
a O
clarifying O
role O
" O
since O
" O
it O
has O
limited O
its O
borders O
" O
to O
products O
from O
the O
third O
world O
and O
to O
the O
workforce O
of O
poor O
areas O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
his O
speech O
Cuevas B-PER
several O
times O
set O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
as O
an O
example O
both O
in O
terms O
of O
job O
creation O
rates O
" O
due O
to O
a O
policy O
of O
integration O
of O
foreign O
labour O
" O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
technological O
advances O
. O

For O
Spain B-ORG
, O
he O
insisted O
, O
" O
it O
is O
vital O
not O
to O
lose O
the O
capabilities O
granted O
by O
the O
scientific O
- O
technical O
revolution O
" O
, O
so O
he O
urged O
the O
public O
authorities O
to O
increase O
their O
investments O
and O
consider O
" O
essential O
" O
the O
new O

In O
order O
for O
Europe B-ORG
to O
increase O
its O
competitive O
advantages O
vis O
- O
à O
- O
vis O
the O
USA B-ORG
it O
is O
necessary O
, O
among O
other O
measures O
, O
to O
cut O
public O
spending O
, O
increase O
the O
quota O
of O
immigrants O
, O
not O
reduce O
working O
hours O
, O
reduce O
inflationary O
tensions O
and O
increase O
its O
investment O
in O
R&D. B-MISC

As O
a O
result O
of O
these O
measures O
, O
already O
in O
place O
in O
the O
USA B-LOC
, O
the O
dollar O
is O
a O
solid O
currency O
that O
" O
is O
gaining O
ground O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
euro O
" O
, O
said O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
it O
specified O
that O
the O
euro O
quotation O
" O
pays O
one O
day O
after O
other O
various O
national O
errors O
" O
such O
as O
the O
35 O
hours O
of O
France B-LOC
, O
the O
failure O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
Stability B-MISC
Pact I-MISC
in O
Italy B-LOC
and O
excessive O
wage O
growth O
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

In O
summary O
, O
stated O
, O
" O
there O
are O
many O
and O
very O
deep O
structural O
reforms O
" O
that O
Europe B-ORG
must O
face O
, O
despite O
which O
, O
in O
recent O
years O
Spain B-ORG
has O
been O
at O
the O
forefront O
of O
European O
growth O
and O
has O
reduced O
the O
income O
difference O
that O
separated O
it O
from O
the O
EU B-ORG
average O
and O
that O
has O
gone O
from O
78 O
to O
82 O
percent O
. O

Finally O
, O
Cuevas B-PER
outlined O
some O
of O
the O
CEOE B-ORG

objectives O
for O
the O

such O

" O
there O

" O
because O

The O

The O
confirmation O
of O
the O

which O
the O

sought O
to O

The O
coup O

reflects O
the O
discontent O
that O

since O
the O

of O

by O

Some O
sections O
of O
the O

blame O
the O

, O
for O
lack O
of O

last O
July O
in O

The O

the O

the O

The O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
decided O
to O
open O
the O
case O
against O
the O
tax O
aid O
schemes O
established O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
Navarre B-LOC
on O
14 O
July O
1999 O
and O
, O
although O
the O
decision O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
immediate O
condemnation O
of O
those O
schemes O
, O
it O
can O
in O
theory O
lead O
to O
the O
obligation O
to O
refund O
the O
aid O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
Brussels B-ORG
made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
did O
not O
question O
the O
fiscal O
competences O
that O
both O
communities O
have O
thanks O
to O
the O
Statute B-MISC
of I-MISC
Guernica I-MISC
and O
the O
Statute B-MISC
of I-MISC
Navarra I-MISC
, O
but O
some O
measures O
of O
its O
regimes O
which O
it O
considered O
" O
discriminatory O
" O
and O
incompatible O
with O
European O
rules O
of O
free O
competition O
. O

The O
then O
Commissioner O
for O
Competition B-MISC
, O
Karel B-PER
van I-PER
Miert I-PER
, O
argued O
that O
aid O
to O
the O
Basque O
and O
Navy O
had O
the O
characteristics O
of O
" O
State B-ORG
aid O
" O
and O
" O
could O
be O
considered O
illegal O
" O
since O
" O
it O
is O
financed O
from O
public O
resources O
, O
favours O
certain O
companies O
, O
distorts O
competition O
and O
affects O
exchanges O
between O
Member O

" O
. O

Against O
this O
view O
of O
the O
Commission B-ORG
, O
President O
Navarro O
said O
today O
that O
tax O
aid O
from O
his O
community O
" O
in O
no O
case O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
state B-ORG
aid O
, O
since O
the O
four O
cases O
in O
which O
companies O
have O
opted O
for O
this O
type O
of O
tax O
aid O
have O
been O
able O
to O
deduct O
from O
corporate O
tax O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
million O
pesetas O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
shared O
that O
amount O
with O
the O
528 O
million O
pesetas O
that O
, O
he O
said O
, O
those O
same O
companies O
could O
have O
saved O
if O
they O
had O
opted O
for O
direct O
aid O
to O
investment O
and O
employment O
on O
fixed O
assets O
: O
" O
but O
as O
our O
tax O
aid O
on O
corporate O
tax O
exemptions O
are O
incompatible O
with O
direct O
aid O
, O
they O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
so O
and O
have O
clearly O
seen O
themselves O
disadvantaged O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
added O
that O
, O
with O
the O
announcement O
of O
the O
repeal O
of O

, O
he O
hoped O
that O
the O

that O

analysing O
which O

the O
two O
is O
the O
most O
appropriate O
. O

The O
two O
solutions O
have O
a O
similar O
cost O
- O
some O
35 O
billion O
- O
and O
while O
the O
gas O
pipeline O
has O
a O
smaller O
environmental O
impact O
because O
it O
does O
not O
require O
the O
enabling O
of O
reservoirs O
, O
it O
has O
the O
disadvantage O
of O
materially O
limiting O
the O
amount O
of O
gas O
that O
can O
be O
driven O
to O
the O
islands O
through O
submarine O
tubes O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
transporting O
gas O
by O
boat O
to O
the O
archipelago O
means O
the O
installation O
of O
a O
transformer O
station O
, O
but O
has O
the O
positive O
aspect O
that O
, O
if O
in O
the O
future O
more O
of O
this O
element O

needed O
, O
it O
is O
enough O

I O

" O
. O

Salva B-PER
acknowledged O
that O
these O
triumphs O
had O
been O
possible O
, O
largely O
, O
by O
the O

by O

by O
its O
former O

Francisco B-PER
Moreno I-PER
, O
who O
said O
: O
" O

always O
relied O
on O
our O

although O
. O
that O
there O
have O
also O
been O
moments O
some O
sensitive O
moments O
" O
. O

Salva B-PER
's O
intention O
is O
to O
focus O
on O
continuing O
his O
studies O
to O
achieve O
the O
title O
of O
national O
coach O
, O
one O
of O
his O
major O
challenges O
in O

to O
deepen O
and O
expand O
his O
knowledge O
of O

. O

For O
his O
part O
, O
Francisco B-PER
Moreno I-PER
commented O
that O
, O
" O
I O
am O
not O
surprised O
by O
Salva B-PER
's O
decision O
since O
this O
was O
his O
last O

of O

and O
one O

only O
make O
a O

positive O
balance O
of O
the O

has O
been O

the O

. O

Finally O
commented O
, O
that O
" O
although O
this O
is O
a O
young O
coach O
with O

, O
he O
does O
n't O
think O
he O
misses O

be O

The O
judgement O
of O
Section B-MISC
Four I-MISC
, O
to O
which O
Efe B-ORG
has O
had O
access O
, O
says O
that O
the O
victim O
's O
version O
has O
more O
" O
internal O
consistency O
" O
and O
more O
" O
conviction O
power O
of O
the O
entire O
testimony O
" O
than O
that O
offered O
by O
the O
accused O
, O
defined O
as O
" O
incredible O
and O
full O
of O
inconsistencies O
" O
. O

The O
accused O
stated O
in O
the O
trial O
that O
the O
relations O
were O
agreed O
and O
attributed O
the O
complaint O
to O
the O
resentment O
of O
his O
ex O
- O
boyfriend O
because O
he O
had O
just O
communicated O
to O
him O
his O
unilateral O
decision O
to O
break O
up O
the O
relationship O
and O
return O
with O
his O
first O
wife O
, O
but O
the O
judgment O
considers O
that O
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
such O
" O
impugned O
breakup O
" O
is O
the O
statement O
of O
the O
accused O
. O

The O
conviction O
is O
also O
based O
on O
the O
numerous O
injuries O
suffered O
by O
the O
woman O
when O
she O
was O
beaten O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
which O
produced O
her O
" O
hematomas O
in O
both O
axils O
, O
contusion O
in O

left O
ear O
, O
contusion O
in O

areas O

left O
lip O
area O
, O
facial O
contusions O
and O
stiffness O
of O
the O
tenth O
rib O
" O
, O
for O
which O
the O
judges O
impose O
on O
the O
accused O
six O
weekends O
of O
arrest O
. O

It O
says O
the O
sentence O
that O
these O
" O
spectacular O
stigmas O
of O
violence O
" O
, O
although O
produced O
at O
a O
time O
prior O
to O
the O
sexual O
act O
, O
are O
further O
evidence O
of O
the O
victim O
's O
lack O
of O
consent O
, O
since O
" O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
the O
violence O
required O
in O
sexual O
assaults O
with O
vaginal O
penetration O
has O
no O
reason O
to O
fall O
precisely O
on O
the O
genital O
area O
" O
. O

The O
judges O
refer O
to O
the O
" O
inconsistencies O
" O
of O
the O
accused O
's O
version O
, O
since O
" O
if O
he O
had O
been O
for O
a O
year O
expressing O
his O
desire O
to O
return O
with O
his O
family O
, O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
explain O
why O
only O
a O
month O
before O
the O
facts O
began O
to O
live O
together O
" O
nor O
why O
" O
he O
was O
looking O
for O
her O
at O
the O
discotheque O
at O
high O
hours O
of O
the O
night O
" O
. O

" O
Unless O
the O
relations O
were O
assembled O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
most O
elementary O
sadomasochism O
" O
- O
adds O
the O
sentence O
- O
it O
is O
not O
understood O
that O
" O
a O
woman O
who O
has O
just O
been O
brutally O
assaulted O
immediately O
shows O
up O
willing O
to O
throw O
pelicans O
at O
the O
sea O
and O
throw O
herself O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
her O
aggressor O
to O
have O
sex O
with O
him O
not O
once O
, O
but O
twice O
in O
the O
version O
of O
this O
" O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
verdict O
devalues O
the O
dismissal O
requested O
by O
the O
prosecutor O
and O
the O
defence O
and O
imposes O
on O
F. B-PER

six O

the O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party O
: O

Within O
the O
silence O
and O
confusion O
with O
the O
opposition O
to O
Yugoslav O
President O
Slobodan B-PER
Milosevic I-PER
, O
the O
population O
has O
begun O
to O
play O
cards O
with O
a O
bargain O
in O
which O
their O
caricatured O
leaders O
paint O
hearts O
, O
beards O
and O
other O
fools O
. O

These O
cheap O
ones O
were O
sold O
four O
days O
ago O
for O
the O
equivalent O
of O
two O
dollars O
, O
but O
they O
are O
no O
longer O
easy O
to O
find O
and O
, O
the O
few O
that O
exist O
until O
a O
new O
reprint O

are O
worth O
quite O
more O
. O

The O
king O
of O
hearts O
of O
the O
bargain O
is O
Milosevic B-PER
, O
incombustible O
for O
a O
decade O
to O
three O
wars O
of O
secession O
lost O
and O
to O
78 O

with O
his O

somewhat O

The O
other O
axis O
of O
the O
bargain O
is O
the O
unpredictable O

populist O
and O
monastic O
opponent O
Vuk B-PER
Draskovic I-PER
, O
with O
cut O
beard O
, O
black O
dress O
and O
blue O
coat O
more O
delicious O
than O
the O
ones O
he O
wears O
in O

life O
. O

The O
third O
king O
paints O

and O
is O
the O
ultra O

nationalist O
conservative O
Vojislav B-PER
Seselj I-PER
, O
who O
appears O
hanging O
a O
stick O
in O
his O

in O

to O
his O
reputation O
as O
" O
Milosevic B-PER

always O
willing O

execute O
the O
wicked O
one O
he O
wants O

The O
fourth O
is O
the O
aloof O
opponent O
Zoran B-PER
Djindjic I-PER
, O
in O
a O
position O
to O
make O
a O
cake O
of O
European O
colors O
, O
breaking O
a O
egg O
that O
falls O
on O
the O

The O
queen O
of O

is O
Milosevic B-PER

wife O
, O
Mira B-PER
Markovic I-PER

a O

Another O

Danica B-PER
Draskovic I-PER

wife O

The O

almost O
100 O

that O

may O

the O
only O
diplomatic O
base O
that O

The O

to O
a O
man O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
allegedly O
had O
homosexual O
relations O
surprised O
his O
friends O
because O
the O
victim O
was O
known O
as O
" O
feminine O
" O
, O
as O
well O
as O
" O
good O
and O
shy O

twenty O
years O
, O
a O
period O
in O
which O
he O
had O
not O
known O
any O
homosexual O

so O
the O
possible O
involvement O
of O

Malaga O
and O
the O

Yesterday O
, O
the O
defendant O
assured O
that O
he O
barely O
remembered O
the O
facts O
because O
they O
happened O
while O
he O
was O
in O
a O
state O
of O

consciousness O
and O
that O
he O
was O

himself O
in O
the O

he O
kept O

The O
prosecutor O
explains O
that O
the O

had O
sex O
with O

on O
two O
different O
occasions O
before O
his O
murder O
in O
August O
, O
and O
in O
one O
of O
them O
he O
took O
the O
alleged O
perpetrator O
to O
his O
home O
, O
where O
the O
aggressor O
was O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
, O
" O
so O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party O
: O

The O
Basque B-ORG
Government I-ORG
has O
today O
expressed O
its O
disagreement O
with O
the O
adoption O
of O
several O
legislative O
proposals O
by O
the O
PSE B-ORG
- I-ORG
EE I-ORG
and O
the O
PP B-ORG
, O
which O
aim O
to O
amend O

At O
its O
meeting O
of O
the O
Governing B-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
the O
Regional O
Executive B-ORG
stated O
, O
firstly O
, O
" O
that O
any O
amendment O
of O
the O
LTH B-MISC
requires O
the O
necessary O
political O
consensus O
and O
, O
fundamentally O
, O
the O
necessary O
consultation O
of O
the O
forest O
bodies O
" O
. O

In O
its O
opinion O
, O
" O
a O
unilateral O
amendment O
of O
this O
rule O
governing O
relations O
between O
the O
Basque O
Government B-ORG
and O
the O
Chambers O
of O
Deputies B-ORG
without O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
Chambers O
of O

would O
imply O
institutional O
disregard O
" O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
considered O
that O
a O
potential O
alteration O
of O
the O
current O
competitive O
distribution O
of O
water O
" O
can O
not O
be O
addressed O
in O
isolation O
but O
through O
a O
sectoral O
law O
that O
regulates O
this O
matter O
globally O
" O
. O

And O
he O
recalled O
that O
the O
legislative O
calendar O
for O
this O
parliamentary O
term O
included O
the O
preliminary O
draft O
on O
the O
Basque B-MISC

" O
This O
legislative O
text O
must O
be O
consulted O
by O
the O

must O
include O
the O

and O
, O
eventually O
, O
the O
amendments O
that O
are O
relevant O
in O
this O
matter O
in O
the O
LTH B-MISC

noted O

spokesman O
for O
the O
Basque B-ORG

, O
Josu B-PER
Jon I-PER

. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
Government B-ORG
also O
showed O
dissatisfaction O
with O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
proposal O
for O
a O

tabled O
by O

in O
its O
opinion O
, O
" O
the O

Group O
intends O
to O
amend O
the O
fourth O
additional O
provision O
of O
the O
above O

so O
that O
the O

a O
revised O
text O
that O
includes O
the O
changes O
that O
have O
taken O
place O
since O
its O
adoption O
" O
. O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
the O
Executive B-ORG
's O
argument O
to O
counter O
this O
possibility O
is O
that O
the O
formula O
contained O
in O
the O

proposal O
for O
this O
purpose O
- O
the O
legislative O
delegation O
- O
" O

not O
the O

one O
" O
. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
the O
Government B-ORG
will O
in O
the O

frequently O

" O
I O

His O
work O
, O
breaking O

reflects O
a O

which O
also O
points O

such O

one O
of O

to O
prevent O

The O
other O
solution O

" O
The O
absence O

very O
remarkable O

The O

the O

more O
" O
internal O
consistency O

more O
" O
conviction O
power O
of O
the O
entire O
testimony O
" O
than O
that O
offered O
by O
the O
accused O
, O
defined O
as O
" O
incredible O
and O
full O
of O
inconsistencies O
" O
. O

The O
accused O
stated O
in O
the O
trial O
that O
the O
relations O
were O
agreed O
and O
attributed O
the O
complaint O
to O
the O
resentment O
of O
his O
ex O
- O
boyfriend O
because O
he O
had O
just O
communicated O
to O
him O
his O
unilateral O
decision O
to O
break O
up O
the O
relationship O
and O
return O
with O
his O
first O
wife O
, O
but O
the O
judgment O
considers O
that O
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
such O
" O
impugned O
breakup O
" O
is O
the O
statement O
of O
the O
accused O
. O

The O
conviction O
is O
also O
based O
on O
the O
numerous O
injuries O
suffered O
by O
the O
woman O
when O
she O
was O
beaten O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
which O
produced O
her O
" O
hematomas O
in O
both O

, O
contusion O
in O

left O
ear O
, O

contusions O
and O
stiffness O
of O

" O
, O
for O
which O
the O
judges O
impose O
on O
the O
accused O
six O
weekends O
of O
arrest O
. O

It O
says O
the O
sentence O
that O
these O
" O
spectacular O
stigmas O
of O
violence O
" O
, O
although O
produced O
at O
a O
time O
prior O
to O
the O
sexual O
act O
, O
are O
further O
evidence O
of O
the O
victim O
's O
lack O
of O
consent O
, O
since O
" O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
the O
violence O
required O
in O
sexual O
assaults O
with O
vaginal O
penetration O
has O
no O
reason O
to O
fall O
precisely O
on O

the O

not O

" O
incomparable O

the O

According O
to O
the O
award O
- O
winning O
doctors O
highlighted O
in O
a O
communication O
from O
the O
Government B-ORG
of I-ORG
Navarre I-ORG
, O
the O
woman O
who O
has O
been O
amputated O
a O
breast O
" O
normally O
depicts O
wearing O
as O
it O
did O
before O
, O
gives O
her O
shame O
to O
go O
to O
the O
pool O
or O
the O
beach O
, O
and O
can O
even O
be O
affected O
in O
her O
sexual O
life O
" O
. O

Thus O
, O
they O
added O
, O
breast O
reconstruction O
is O
not O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
aesthetics O
, O
but O
it O
is O
also O
part O
of O
the O
comprehensive O
treatment O
of O
breast O
cancer O
that O
helps O
women O
to O
reintegrate O
into O
their O
ordinary O
life O
with O
absolute O
normality O
. O

Breast O
reconstruction O
, O
according O
to O
each O
patient O
, O
can O
be O
performed O
immediately O
, O
in O
the O
same O
operation O
in O
which O
the O
mastectomy O
is O
performed O
, O
or O
differently O
, O
after O
having O
overcome O
all O
treatments O
complementary O
to O
the O
disease O
of O
the O
oncological O
patient O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
are O
various O
surgical O
techniques O
to O
restore O
the O
breast O
, O
which O
are O
applied O
according O
to O
the O
physical O
characteristics O
of O
the O
patient O
, O
the O
type O
of O
cancer O
he O
suffers O
or O
the O
subsequent O
treatment O
still O
awaiting O
him O
. O

These O
techniques O
, O
whose O
application O
extends O
the O
awarded O
work O
, O
are O
basically O
divided O
into O
autologous O
, O
those O
in O
which O
the O
breast O
is O
reconstructed O
with O
women O
's O
own O
tissues O
obtained O
from O
the O
back O
or O
abdomen O
, O
and O
those O
that O
use O
synthetic O
materials O
. O

The O
autologous O
techniques O
, O
according O
to O
the O
specialists O
, O
" O
have O
the O
advantage O
that O
they O
do O
not O
produce O
rejection O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
that O
the O
mother O
is O
the O
woman O
's O
own O
and O
over O
time O
it O
adapts O
to O
the O
changes O
that O
record O
its O
physical O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
the O
patient O
gets O
fat O
, O
the O
reconstructed O
breast O
also O
gets O
worse O
" O
. O

However O
, O
the O
negative O
part O
" O
is O
that O
it O
leaves O
visible O
scars O
wherever O
you O
have O
gone O
looking O
for O
tissues O
, O
although O
we O
have O
recently O
improved O
a O
lot O
to O
minimize O
these O
scars O
" O
. O

Breast O
reconstruction O
using O
silicone O
expanders O
and O
prosthetics O
is O
an O
alternative O
to O
autologous O
techniques O
that O
" O
leave O
no O
scars O
in O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
and O
aesthetically O
give O
a O
good O
result O
, O
although O
they O
can O
cause O
rejection O
by O
the O
patient O
, O
when O
treated O
with O
a O
strange O
body O

González B-PER
Ballesta I-PER
explained O
that O

clarifying O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O
" O
special O

would O
prescribe O

The O

The O
President O

pointed O
out O
that O
the O

of O

As O
the O
Assembly B-ORG

international O
bodies O
have O
repeatedly O
asked O
Russia B-ORG
to O
enter O
into O
negotiations O
with O
the O
Chechens O
, O
it O
would O
be O
" O
inconsistent O

counterproductive O
for O

that O
we O
would O
avoid O
such O
contacts O
" O
, O
he O
stressed O
. O

Last O

the O
Parliamentary B-ORG

the O

the O

The O
Galician O
economic O

he O
said O

had O
to O

travelled O

composed O
mainly O
of O

which O
, O
having O

the O
continuous O
filtering O
have O
been O
giving O
up O

Although O
these O
filters O
do O
not O
pose O
a O
serious O

, O
it O
is O
true O
that O
they O
are O
producing O
significant O

which O
obliges O

take O
urgent O
measures O
to O
solve O
the O

that O

Sanz B-PER
stated O
in O
Brussels B-LOC
, O
after O
a O
meeting O
with O
Monti B-PER
, O
that O
" O
the O
rule O
will O
be O
abolished O
because O
only O
four O
companies O
in O
five O

have O
welcomed O
it O
, O
in O
clear O

having O
given O
up O

The O
President O

explained O
that O

He O

that O

" O
we O
can O

it O
shortly O
" O

" O
We O
are O
currently O
in O

we O

proceed O

carry O

this O

" O
, O
he O
added O
. O

The O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
decided O
to O
open O
the O
case O
against O
the O
tax O
aid O
schemes O
established O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
Navarre B-LOC
on O
14 O
July O
1999 O
and O
, O
although O
the O
decision O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
immediate O
condemnation O
of O
those O
schemes O
, O
it O
can O
in O
theory O
lead O
to O
the O
obligation O
to O
refund O
the O
aid O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
Brussels B-LOC
made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
did O
not O
question O
the O
fiscal O
competences O
that O
both O
communities O
have O
thanks O
to O
the O
Statute B-MISC
of I-MISC
Guernica I-MISC
and O
the O
Statute B-MISC
of I-MISC
Navarra I-MISC
, O
but O
some O
measures O
of O
its O
regimes O
which O
it O
considered O
" O
discriminatory O
" O
and O
incompatible O
with O
European O
rules O
of O
free O
competition O
. O

The O
then O
Commissioner O
for O
Competition B-MISC
, O
Karel B-PER
van I-PER
Miert I-PER
, O
argued O
that O
aid O
to O
the O
Basque O
and O
Navy O
had O
the O
characteristics O
of O
" O
State B-ORG
aid O
" O
and O
" O
could O
be O
considered O
illegal O
" O
since O
" O
it O
is O
financed O
from O
public O
resources O
, O
favours O
certain O
companies O
, O
distorts O
competition O
and O
affects O
exchanges O
between O
Member O
States B-ORG
" O
. O

Against O
this O
view O
of O
the O
Commission B-ORG
, O
President O
Navarro O
said O
today O
that O
tax O
aid O
from O
his O
community O
" O
in O
no O
case O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
state B-ORG
aid O
, O
since O
the O
four O
cases O
in O
which O
companies O
have O
opted O
for O
this O
type O
of O
tax O
aid O
have O
been O
able O
to O
deduct O
from O
corporate O
tax O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
million O
pesetas O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
shared O
that O
amount O
with O
the O
528 O
million O
pesetas O
that O
, O
he O
said O
, O
those O
same O
companies O
could O
have O
saved O
if O
they O
had O
opted O
for O
direct O
aid O
to O
investment O
and O
employment O
on O
fixed O
assets O
: O
" O
but O
as O
our O
tax O
aid O
on O
corporate O
tax O
exemptions O
are O
incompatible O
with O
direct O
aid O
, O
they O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
so O
and O
have O
clearly O
seen O
themselves O
disadvantaged O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
added O
that O
, O
with O
the O
announcement O
of O
the O
repeal O
of O
the O
regulation O
, O
he O
hoped O
that O
the O
European B-ORG

" O
could O
take O
the O
decision O
not O
to O
impose O
any O

Sanz B-PER
said O
that O
" O
proceeding O
with O
the O
rescue O
and O
liberalisation O
of O

document O
this O

The O

The O
President O
made O
these O
statements O
in O
Brussels B-LOC
, O
where O
today O
he O
met O
with O
European O
Commissioner O
for O
Competition B-MISC
Mario B-PER
Monti I-PER
, O
who O
announced O
the O
next O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
formal O
regulation O
against O
which O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
opened O
a O
case O
last O
year O
. O

The O
President O
of O
Navarre O
added O
that O
the O
opposition O
" O
is O
trying O
to O
capture O
the O
wills O
of O
the O
electorate O
by O
saying O
: O
we O
want O
the O
motorway O
of O
Navarre B-LOC
to O
be O
free O
for O
all O
citizens O
without O
considering O
and O
without O
telling O
them O
the O
counterpart O
that O
this O
means O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
" O
saving O
the O
highway O
and O
making O
it O
free O
of O
charge O
logically O
means O
stopping O
providing O
another O
series O
of O
services O
in O
an O
important O
way O
" O
. O

He O
said O
that O
given O
that O
the O
cost O
of O
such O
a O
measure O
would O
be O
between O
EUR O
60 O
billion O
and O
EUR O
140 O
billion O
and O
given O
that O
the O
Naval O
budget O
is O
EUR O
376 O
billion O
, O
the O
rescue O
decision O
would O
mean O
" O
having O
to O
give O
up O
or O
close O
some O
services O
which O
are O
essential O
and O
which O
are O
in O
high O
demand O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
explained O
that O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
" O
jeopardising O
the O
economic O
viability O
of O
Navarre B-LOC
because O
I O
am O
aware O
that O
anyone O
who O
jeopardises O
it O
also O
jeopardises O
the O
political O
viability O
of O
Navarre B-LOC
as O
a O
differentiated O
community O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
he O
understood O
this O
position O
coming O
from O
" O
some O
initiative O
of O
some O
parliamentary O
group O
" O
that O
" O
does O
not O
believe O
in O
the O
political O
viability O
of O
Navarre B-LOC
as O
a O
differentiated O
community O
" O
" O
They O
call O
for O
the O
rescue O
of O
the O
motorway O
and O
its O
liberation O
parties O
such O
as O
Eusko B-ORG
Alkartasuna I-ORG
and O
do O
not O
call O
for O
it O
in O
their O
communities O
, O
where O
they O
have O
government B-ORG
responsibility O
, O
because O
there O
is O
the O
paradox O
that O
EA B-ORG
has O
government B-ORG
responsibilities O
in O
the O
autonomous O
Basque O
community O
and O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
any O
measures O
put O
forward O
by O
EA B-ORG
in O
the O
Basque O
community O
raising O
the O
rescue O
of O
a O
motorway O
and O
the O
freeing O
of O
tolls O
" O
, O
he O
added O
. O

He O
insisted O
that O
the O
rescue O
of O
the O
highway O
means O
" O
an O
important O
risk O
and O
so O
far O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
insults O
, O
no O
one O
puts O
numbers O
on O
the O
table O
to O
disprove O
what O
I O
and O
my O
government B-ORG
are O
saying O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
rejected O
any O
intention O
to O
resign O
or O
delay O
the O
elections O
and O
stated O
that O
this O
was O
" O
a O
media O
interpretation O
" O
. O

The O
president O
concluded O
by O
saying O
: O
" O
certain O
political O
parties O
are O
being O
blindfolded O
because O
they O
have O
a O
bad O
conscience O
" O
. O

" O
Basically O
, O
they O
think O
the O
same O
as O
I O
do O
but O
they O
act O
in O
a O
less O
responsible O
way O
than O
the O
party O
that O
supports O
the O
government B-ORG
because O
as O
they O
are O
in O
the O
opposition O
it O
's O
okay O
for O
them O
to O
say O
what O
they O
say O
with O
the O
sole O
intention O
of O
trying O
to O
do O
politics O
. O

I O
am O
acting O
responsibly O
and O
I O
say O
that O
this O
is O
putting O

and O
other O
public O

at O
the O
next O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
proposal O
, O
which O
will O
be O
presented O
in O

this O
week O
, O
is O
to O
remedy O
the O
current O
disorderly O
expansion O
of O
this O

According O
to O
the O
group O
, O
nowadays O
, O
the O
only O
criterion O
to O
be O
followed O
are O
the O
" O
strong O
offers O
of O

that O
these O

make O
to O

taken O
into O

the O
negative O

the O
harmful O
effects O
that O
the O
proximity O

can O
cause O
on O
the O
health O
of O

Among O
these O
harmful O
effects O
, O
this O
group O
cites O
the O
increase O

that O
can O
result O
in O

The O
proposed O
regulation O
should O
contain O
minimum O
criteria O
such O
as O
" O
the O
elaboration O
of O
a O

for O
the O

of O
the O

which O
determines O
the O

the O
requirement O
for O
landscape O
integration O
and O
the O
obligation O
for O

to O
use O

" O
. O

According O
to O
EU B-ORG
- I-ORG
EV I-ORG
, O
preventive O
measures O
for O
people O

health O
should O
also O
be O

the O
declaration O
of O
all O
listed O
architectural O
elements O
and O

as O
areas O
free O
of O

should O
be O
included O
. O

As O
this O
regulatory O
framework O
is O
being O
developed O
, O
the O
group O
will O
propose O
the O
temporary O
suspension O
of O
licensing O
for O
the O
installation O
of O
these O
antennae O
and O
the O
drafting O
of O
a O
framework O

to O
protect O

in O
the O
event O
that O

not O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
proposal O
, O
the O
coalition O
will O
present O
other O
motions O
, O
relating O
to O
the O
need O

of O

The O

A O
team O

that O

The O

stresses O
today O
that O
this O
debate O
" O
may O
seem O
surreal O
, O
a O
few O
months O
after O
the O
end O
of O

" O
the O

. O

For O
its O
part O
, O
the O
daily O
" O
France B-ORG

" O
recalls O
that O
the O
researchers O
who O
discovered O
the O
chromosome O
21 O
had O
already O
found O
fewer O
genes O
and O
that O
, O
extrapolating O
it O
to O
the O
total O
human O
genetic O
heritage O
, O
concluded O
that O
man O
had O
40,000 O
genes O
. O

The O
rotation O
explains O
that O
the O
results O
of O
the O
French O
scientists O
were O
obtained O
from O
the O
decoding O
of O
a O

, O
the O

from O

" O
. O

According O
to O
Weissenbach B-PER
, O
" O
90 O
percent O
of O
the O
human O
genetic O
heritage O
should O
be O
known O
by O
the O
end O
of O
this O
year O
and O
the O
controversy O
over O
the O
number O
of O
genes O
should O
calm O
down O
then O
" O
. O

" O
The O
difference O
( O
... O
) O
stems O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
once O
the O
DNA B-MISC
has O
been O
broken O
in O
pieces O
, O
it O
is O
not O
always O
possible O
to O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
the O
difference O
between O

the O
State O

The O
Socialist O

Maite B-PER
Arqué I-PER
, O
and O
Sant B-LOC

, O
Jesús B-PER
María I-PER
Canga I-PER
, O
today O
made O
a O
joint O
visit O
to O
the O
streets O
of O
both O
municipalities O
within O
the O
shared O
will O
to O
tackle O
the O
planning O
of O
solutions O
for O
these O
areas O
. O

The O
main O
administrative O
problem O
between O
the O
two O
municipalities O
is O
the O
complexity O
of O
the O
border O
line O
that O
separates O
them O
. O

It O
is O
a O
line O
that O
separates O
the O
two O
axes O
from O
some O
streets O
or O
even O
blocks O
of O
floors O
, O
some O
of O
which O
belong O
administratively O
to O
Badalona B-LOC
and O
some O
to O
Sant B-LOC

. O

The O
two O
mayors O
, O
accompanied O
by O
several O
councillors O
and O
technicians O
from O
both O
municipalities O
, O
expressed O
their O
interest O
in O
resolving O
this O
draw O
which O
they O
described O
as O
" O
arbitrary O
" O
. O

Maite B-PER
Arqué I-PER
said O
that O
" O
the O
review O
of O
the O
boundaries O
of O
the O
two O
cities O
will O
begin O
, O
with O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
joint O
technical O
committee O
which O
will O
study O
the O
best O
solution O
" O
. O

The O
mayor O
has O
acknowledged O
that O
" O
it O
will O
be O
a O
long O
dossier O
and O
that O
ultimately O
the O
government B-ORG
will O
have O
to O

it O
, O
but O
someday O
we O
must O
start O
to O

it O
" O

For O
his O

, O
Jesus B-PER
María I-PER
Canga I-PER
has O
claimed O

exists O
" O
, O
to O
reiterate O
the O
interest O
of O
his O
municipality O
in O
revising O
the O
name O
of O
the O
current O
Joan B-LOC
XXIII I-LOC
subway I-LOC
station I-LOC
on O
line O
four O
. O

This O
station O
is O
the O
closest O
to O
the O
town O
and O
the O
mayor O
has O
shown O
his O
interest O
because O
the O
name O
of O
this O
town O
is O
reflected O
in O
the O
final O
name O
of O
the O
station O
. O

This O
issue O
has O
remained O
unresolved O
for O
further O
discussion O
, O
since O
neighbours O
and O
municipalities O
must O
reach O
a O
consensus O
which O
, O
afterwards O
, O
the O
two O
municipal O
plenaries O
must O

and O

Baltazar B-PER
Porras I-PER

and O
which O

filtered O

out O

offers O
to O
the O
National B-ORG
Army I-ORG
" O
by O
calling O
into O
question O
its O
democratic O
vocation O
. O

The O
defence B-MISC
minister O
rejects O
the O
descriptions O
of O
" O
the O
pretorian O
arm O
of O
the O
government B-ORG
and O
blackmail O
" O
that O
Porras B-PER
attributed O
to O
the O
military O
institution O
. O

General O
Hurtado B-PER
recalls O
in O
his O
letter O
that O
in O
the O
castle O
ranks O
there O
are O
many O
members O
of O
the O
Catholic O
Church B-ORG
who O
perform O
the O
functions O
of O
military O
chaplains O
, O
so O
he O
suggested O
that O
it O
be O
to O
them O
who O
are O
asked O
whether O
they O
are O
soldiers O
of O
an O
emperor O
. O

Hurtado B-PER
also O
tilda O
of O
" O
disconsidered O
" O
talk O
of O
an O
alleged O
" O
fragile O
" O
armed B-ORG
force I-ORG
, O
because O
, O
he O
says O
, O
the O
men O
and O
women O
who O
exercise O
their O
leadership O
role O
within O
that O
armed O
institution O
allow O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
division O
. O

It O
also O
rejects O
the O
doubts O
expressed O
by O
Porras B-PER
about O
an O
alleged O
inability O
of O
the O
Armed B-ORG
Forces I-ORG
to O
ensure O
the O
transparency O
of O
the O
election O
process O
next O
Sunday O
, O
as O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O

will O
be O
able O
to O
vote O
. O

The O
President O
of O
the O
Episcopal B-MISC
Conference I-MISC
said O
today O
that O
" O
it O
makes O
no O
sense O
" O
to O
fight O
two O
institutions O
of O
such O
prestige O
as O
the O
Catholic O
Church B-ORG
and O
the O
Armed B-ORG
Forces I-ORG
, O
which O
he O
attributed O
to O
interests O
seeking O
to O
divert O
attention O
from O
the O
electoral O
process O
. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
Monsignor O
Roberto B-PER
Luckert I-PER
, O
Bishop O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Coro B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
west O
of O
the O
country O
, O
assured O
that O
the O
Church B-ORG
has O
always O
been O
respectful O
of O
the O
armed O
institution O
, O
and O
clarified O
that O
what O
the O
letter O
of O
the O
bishops O
intended O
was O
" O
to O
alert O
" O
Hurtado B-PER
about O
what O
can O
be O
a O
" O
mismanagement O
" O
of O
the O
Armed B-ORG
Forces I-ORG
. O

The O
Bishop O
stressed O
that O
the O
qualification O
of O
" O
pretorian O
guard O
" O
was O
only O
a O
warning O
that O
the O
Army B-ORG
would O
not O
become O
an O
elite O
body O
and O
personnel O
of O
the O
president O
. O

For O
Luckert B-PER
, O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
letter O
of O
the O
Catholic O
hierarchy O
was O
to O
give O
a O
" O
corner O
" O
in O
time O
to O
avoid O
a O
possible O
temptation O
to O
turn O
the O
military O
into O
a O
pretorian O
force O
and O
to O
divert O
them O
from O
their O
primary O
function O
, O
which O
is O
to O
be O
guarantors O
of O
democratic O
institutionality O
. O

The O

CCOO B-ORG
said O
today O

that O
the O

of O

, O
where O
about O

whose O

for O

, O
if O
nothing O

it O

for O
lack O

, O
as O
the O
majority O
of O

are O
workers O
of O
Renfe B-ORG

This O
fact O
has O
caused O
a O
major O
social O
alarm O
among O
the O
users O
, O
as O
the O
movement O
of O
this O
train O
allows O
them O
to O
continue O
to O
maintain O
their O

in O
Alcazar B-LOC
even O
though O
they O

the O

at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
Municipality B-ORG

that O
also O
move O

fear O

, O
according O
to O
the O
mayor O
of O
Alcázar B-LOC

Fernando B-PER
Sánchez I-PER
Bódalo I-PER
. O

For O
Sánchez B-PER
Bódalo I-PER
the O
measure O
of O
RENFE B-ORG
is O
a O
provocation O
to O
force O
the O
Board B-ORG
to O

while O
criticizing O
that O
action O

On O

called O
for O
a O
comprehensive O
solution O
to O
the O
problem O
of O

since O
it O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O
party O
: O

Palmas B-ORG
, O
Villarreal B-ORG
and O
Osasuna B-ORG
have O
shown O
their O
interest O
in O
the O
Argentine O
forward O
of O
Elche B-ORG
Mariano B-PER
Armentano I-PER
and O
have O
asked O
about O
the O
player O
's O
contractual O
situation O
for O
their O
possible O
signing O
, O
confirmed O
sources O
of O
the O
club O
Alicante O
. O

Armentano B-PER
has O
stated O
repeatedly O
that O
if O
he O
is O
not O
to O
play O
in O
the O
first O
division O
he O
stays O
in O
Elche B-ORG
, O
so O
there O
is O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
next O
campaign O
plays O
in O
any O
of O
the O
teams O
that O
have O
been O
interested O
in O
his O
services O
. O

The O
player O
's O
representative O
, O
Quique B-PER
Pina I-PER
, O
acknowledged O
that O
they O
have O
offers O
of O
clubs O
that O
next O
season O
can O
play O
in O
the O
first O
division O
, O
" O
but O
nothing O
has O
been O
specified O
, O
so O
you O
will O
have O
to O
wait O
to O
see O
how O
it O
all O
ends O
and O
then O
, O
if O
there O
is O
still O
interest O
, O
negotiate O
with O
the O
Elche B-ORG
, O
although O
the O
player O
is O
very O
pleased O
here O
, O
" O
commented O
. O

The O
cancellation O
clause O
of O
the O
contract O
of O
Mariano B-PER
Armentano I-PER
in O
the O
Elche B-ORG
amounts O
to O
fifty O
million O
pesetas O
, O
although O
it O
would O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
the O
possibility O
of O
negotiating O
down O
the O
exit O
of O
the O

of O
the O

ilicitano O

Diego B-PER
Quiles I-PER
, O
Elche B-ORG
’s O
deputy O
councillor O
, O
has O
expressed O
in O
recent O
days O
his O
willingness O
to O
negotiate O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
Argentine O
player O
to O
, O
with O
his O
transfer O
, O
reduce O
the O
deficit O
that O
has O
been O
generated O
in O
the O
last O

in O
the O

In O
this O

is O
undergoing O
a O
period O
of O
recovery O
from O
a O
serious O
injury O
- O
buttock O
rupture O
- O
, O
so O
his O
exit O
from O
Elche B-ORG
seems O
more O
complicated O
. O

This O
would O
not O
be O
the O
first O
time O
that O
Elche B-ORG
sells O
players O
to O
alleviate O
the O
deficit O
it O
has O
generated O
, O
since O
two O

that O

make O

the O

added O
that O
one O
of O

on O

" O

, O
" O
said O
Marcos B-PER

" O
you O

He O
argued O

that O
at O

the O

due O
to O
the O

these O

to O
" O
expose O
them O
in O
the O

to O

also O
the O

a O
fully O

democratic O

something O
that O
still O
does O
not O
shine O

since O
many O

can O
not O
live O
with O

" O
, O
declared O

Iturgaiz B-PER
stressed O
that O
" O
this O
denunciation O
must O
not O
only O
be O
written O

but O
also O
transmitted O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
engaged O
in O
the O

" O

" O
Because O
the O

in O
an O

, O
where O
the O
lack O

prevails O

lives O
under O

The O

added O
that O
" O
therefore O
the O
debate O
raised O
by O
the O
Basque O

is O
not O
who O
is O
better O
informed O
about O
what O
, O
but O
something O
more O
profound O
: O
how O
to O
survive O
in O
a O
society O
in O
which O
fundamental O
democratic O
rights O
are O
enshrined O
and O
for O
whose O
denunciation O
you O
run O
the O
risk O
not O

of O

also O
of O
physical O

The O
Committee O
recommends O
that O
the O
State O

: O

Abulense O
writer O
José B-PER
Jiménez I-PER
Lozano I-PER
warned O
today O
in O
Tordesillas B-LOC
( O
Valladolid B-LOC

of O
the O
danger O
posed O
by O
the O
excessive O
accumulation O

since O

in O
his O
opinion O
, O
" O
it O
becomes O
a O
riada O
of O
indifferent O
and O
contradictory O
information O
" O

Jiménez B-PER
Lozano I-PER
, O
who O
today O
concluded O
a O
day O
on O
literature O
and O
journalism O
organized O
by O
the O
Duques B-ORG
de I-ORG
Soria I-ORG
foundation I-ORG
, O
explained O
that O
just O
as O
in O
past O
centuries O
people O
did O
not O
know O
the O
reality O
because O
of O
the O
absence O
of O
information O
, O
nowadays O
there O
is O
a O
reverse O
phenomenon O
, O
because O
excessive O
information O
prevents O
the O
public O
from O
selecting O
the O
contents O
. O

He O
also O
added O
that O
the O
configuration O
of O
most O
of O
today O
's O
media O
deprives O
its O
audience O
of O
a O
critical O
sense O
, O
as O
they O
always O
send O
a O
message O
" O
dominant O
and O
imperialist O
" O
, O
so O
" O
it O
is O
not O
useful O
to O
express O
an O
opinion O
in O
an O
eccentric O
way O
, O
because O
that O
opinion O
will O
not O
be O
collected O
by O
the O
media O
" O
. O

Jiménez B-PER
Lozano I-PER
said O
that O
the O
media O
investigate O
first O
the O
audience O
to O
which O
they O
are O
directed O
, O
to O
transform O
the O
message O
according O
to O
their O
audience O
, O
which O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
large O
masses O
obliges O
to O
trivialize O
the O
content O
, O
so O
that O
" O
everything O
becomes O
light O
and O
superficial O
, O
so O
that O
you O
do O
not O
have O
to O
think O
much O
" O
. O

The O
writer O
and O
essayist O
severely O
criticized O
the O
presence O
of O
experts O
working O
for O
the O
media O
, O
of O
whom O
he O
said O
they O
represent O
a O
reality O
in O
which O
" O
the O
personal O
experience O
of O
the O
public O
is O
useless O
, O
with O
which O
it O
is O
deprived O
of O
the O
critical O
sense O
and O
reaches O
to O
idiotism O
" O
. O

Jiménez B-PER
Lozano I-PER
pointed O
out O
that O
with O
this O
way O
of O
thinking O
is O
suppressed O
the O
individual O
to O
go O
to O
the O
" O
adulation O
of O
the O
grass O
" O
, O
and O
added O
that O
they O
are O
present O
in O
the O
media O
" O
who O
speak O
more O
loudly O
, O
have O
greater O
ability O
or O
imagination O
to O
do O
it O
" O
, O
over O
the O
importance O
of O
what O
they O
have O
to O
say O
. O

For O
the O
writer O
Abulense O
, O
the O
relations O
between O
journalism O
and O
classical O
culture O
have O
always O
been O
ambiguous O
, O
because O
" O
the O
big O
issues O
need O
books O
and O
master O
mathematics O
, O
if O
not O
, O
come O
cheap O
pastiches O

For O
Perfecto B-PER

, O
the O
Portuguese O
surrealism O

not O

received O
the O
attention O
it O
deserves O
despite O
having O
given O
rise O
to O

has O
suffered O
numerous O

Cuadrado B-PER

1953 O

something O

Yes O
, O
it O
acknowledged O
that O
it O

it O

As O
for O
the O
accusation O
of O
lack O
of O
originality O
, O
he O
discarded O
this O
topic O
and O
assured O
that O
Portuguese B-LOC
did O
not O
imitate O
the O
surrealism O
that O
was O
done O
in O
Spain B-LOC
because O
it O
was O
not O
known O
at O
the O
time O
, O
while O
he O
considered O
as O
a O

this O

the O

it O

the O

that O

The O
PSOE B-ORG
deputy O
said O
that O
the O
PP B-ORG
wanted O
to O
infect O
the O
government B-ORG
with O
its O
nervousness O
so O
that O
it O
would O
hurry O
and O
then O
perhaps O
have O
an O
inadequate O
response O
to O
society O
. O

He O
expressed O
the O
support O
of O
the O
Socialist O
parliamentary O
group O
for O
the O
government B-ORG
of I-ORG
Aragon I-ORG
and O
urged O
the O
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
Education I-ORG
to O
continue O
to O
work O
with O
the O
participation O
of O
the O
educational O
community O
. O

For O
Jesus B-PER
Miguel I-PER
Franco I-PER
, O
the O
PP B-ORG
thought O
that O
education O
policy O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
" O
disaster O
" O
from O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
course O
and O
that O
it O
would O
not O
be O
possible O
to O
achieve O
some O
social O
peace O
in O
the O
Aragón B-LOC
Community I-LOC
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
academic O
course O
began O
normally O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
teachers O
and O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
resources O
allocated O
to O
the O
centres O
, O
which O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
began O
to O
concern O
the O
PP B-ORG
. O

It O
also O
highlighted O
the O
staff O
policy O
promoted O
by O
the O
Education B-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
the O
main O
instrument O
of O
education O
, O
in O
order O
to O
achieve O
full O
staffing O
and O
to O
promote O
the O
stability O
of O
teachers O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
university O
policy O
, O
he O
underlined O
the O
Government B-ORG
's O
proposal O
to O
boost O
the O
basic O
funding O
of O
the O
academic O
institution O
, O
following O
the O
difficulties O
of O
the O
various O
regional O
governments B-ORG
with O
the O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
Zaragoza I-ORG
. O

He O
also O
highlighted O
the O
draft O
Covenant B-MISC
for I-MISC
Education I-MISC
, O
drawn O
up O
by O
the O
Council B-ORG
, O
as O
the O
appropriate O
methodology O
for O
consolidating O
quality O
education O
and O
stabilising O
the O
educational O
community O
with O
the O
support O
of O

. O

He O
considered O
that O
another O
matter O
of O
concern O
to O
the O
PP B-ORG
is O
that O
" O
the O
coalition O
government B-ORG
does O
not O
show O
signs O
of O
overheating O

but O
that O
, O
in O

He O
acknowledged O
that O
" O
the O
only O
hurdle O
or O
difficulty O
" O
that O
the O
current O
Executive B-ORG
could O
overcome O
was O
the O
controversy O
over O
the O
access O
of O

to O
the O
regional O
administration B-ORG
, O
which O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
was O
" O
a O
poisoned O
legacy O
of O

In O

the O
support O
of O
the O
Strasbourg O

is O
expected O
. O

Fifteen B-MISC
have O
been O
applying O
since O
1998 O
a O
directive O
adopted O
two O
years O
before O
after O
an O
agreement O
between O
employers O
and O
European O
unions O
which O
provides O
for O
a O
minimum O
period O
of O
maternity O
leave O
of O
three O
months O
( O
12 O
weeks O
) O
, O
the O
modalities O
of O
which O
are O
regulated O
according O
to O
the O
collective O
agreement O
that O
applies O
to O
the O
worker O
. O

The O
European B-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
will O
call O
for O
a O
revision O
of O
this O
directive O
or O
the O
elaboration O
of O
another O
specific O
directive O
which O
increases O
the O
protection O
of O
pregnant O
workers O
, O
in O
order O
to O
extend O
maternity O
leave O
to O
20 O
weeks O
, O
of O
which O
eight O
will O
form O
a O
minimum O
period O
of O
rest O
after O
giving O
birth O
. O

The O
directive O
should O
provide O
, O
according O
to O
the O
parliamentary O
proposal O
, O
for O
a O
" O
more O
precise O
" O
definition O
of O
the O
benefits O
women O
can O
receive O
during O
maternity O
leave O
, O
including O
the O
maintenance O
of O
" O
at O
least O
80 O
per O
cent O
of O
the O
salary O
" O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
ban O
on O
the O
dismissal O
of O
the O
worker O
throughout O
the O
period O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
should O
consider O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
break O
that O
can O
cover O
the O
entire O
period O
of O
pregnancy O
if O
there O
are O
risks O
to O
the O
health O
of O
the O
mother O
or O
the O
baby O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
directive O
should O
regulate O
periods O
of O
rest O
during O
work O
to O
allow O
a O
mother O
to O
breastfeed O
the O
child O
and O
prohibit O
the O
possibility O
of O
the O
employee O
having O
to O
cover O
a O
night O
shift O
, O
especially O
16 O
weeks O
before O
or O
after O
childbirth O
. O

If O
the O
Strasbourg B-LOC
plenary O
supports O
this O
proposal O
, O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
could O
be O
obliged O
to O
use O
its O
power O
of O
legislative O
initiative O
to O
draw O
up O
a O
draft O
directive O
, O
which O
would O
be O
presented O
to O
EU B-ORG
labour O
ministers O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
the O
European B-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
is O
to O
bring O
European O
standards O
for O
the O
protection O
of O
pregnant O
workers O
into O
line O
with O
those O
which O
are O
more O
advanced O
in O
some O
EU O
countries O
and O
to O
fill O
the O
gaps O
which O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
the O
implementation O
of O
the O
1996 O
directive O
, O
according O
to O
the O
point O
made O
by O
the O
Portuguese O
MEP O
. O

The O
first O
attempt O
to O
harmonise O
maternity O
leave O
in O
the O
EU B-ORG
took O
place O
in O
1983 O
, O
but O
only O
an O

today O
that O
the O

something O
" O

" O
What O

Fischer B-PER

the O
EU B-ORG

, O
but O
for O
that O
it O
needs O

In O

all O

should O
increase O

something O

When O

Galaverna B-PER
asked O

" O
and O
of O

there O

the O

there O
is O
" O
disconformity O
" O

not O
precisely O

or O
exclusively O
, O
because O
of O
a O
question O

because O

" O
There O
are O
delays O
in O

if O

that O

that O

the O
most O
important O
, O
that O

the O

secondary O

I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
second O
that O
he O
scored O
this O

because O
I O
tricked O

not O

" O
Whenever O
it O
is O
thrown O
at O

it O
is O
done O

sometimes O
it O

other O

on O

acknowledged O
that O
the O

" O

I O
think O
it O
is O
extendable O

the O
best O
is O
that O

In O
this O

Eloy B-PER

that O
" O
the O

has O
been O
key O
to O
overcoming O

bad O
moments O
, O

they O

" O
when O
you O

" O
Now O
the O
goal O
is O
to O
consolidate O
the O

in O
the O
First B-MISC

and O
I O
think O
it O
's O
significant O
that O
in O

years O
the O
teams O
that O
have O
risen O
have O
responded O
to O
the O
category O
and O
in O
a O
way O
have O
been O
revelation O
, O
since O
they O
keep O
their O
blocks O
, O
they O
work O
a O

in O

and O
so O
it O

very O

them O

Mexican O
" O
anti O

represents O
the O

. O

" O
China B-ORG
and O
Mexico B-ORG
are O
negotiating O
but O
there O
is O
still O
no O

because O
Mexico B-ORG
maintains O
a O

anti O

on O
some O
Chinese B-LOC
products O
that O

According O
to O
the O
Chinese O

the O
products O
of O
his O
country O
on O
which O
Mexico B-ORG
intends O
to O
apply O
measures O
against O

are O
mainly O
those O
related O

the O

which O

percentage O
of O

Ping B-PER

noted O
that O
" O

the O

" O
. O

" O
I O
believe O
that O

be O
able O

sign O
the O

that O
this O

" O
the O

To O
join O

, O
Guatemala B-ORG

The O
products O

those O
that O

by O
any O
other O
country O

i.e. O

it O

" O
We O
have O
to O
look O
at O
the O
products O
in O
which O
Mexico B-ORG
has O
some O
comparative O
export O
advantage O
and O
in O
which O
we O
know O
that O
it O
is O
worth O
fighting O
, O
that O
China B-ORG
will O
not O
give O
it O
to O
another O
country O
and O
that O
is O
not O
a O

that O
shooting O
in O

The O
victim O
, O
30 O

, O
was O
found O
by O

last O
Friday O
in O
the O

in O

, O
after O
both O
had O
a O
strong O
discussion O
in O
the O
living O
room O
of O
the O

. O

After O
the O
dispute O
, O
the O
police O
forced O
the O
victim O
to O
pick O
up O
her O
things O
and O
left O
the O
house O
and O
she O
entered O
the O
bedroom O
and O
while O
making O
her O

saw O
the O

, O
with O
which O
, O
allegedly O
, O
the O
shooting O
, O
according O
to O
the O
investigators O
so O
far O
determined O
. O

The O
same O

pointed O
out O
that O
in O
the O
police O

regular O
weapon O
with O
which O
the O
shooting O
was O
carried O
out O
, O
no O
marks O
of O
either O
of O
the O
two O
were O
found O
and O
pointed O
out O
that O
it O
is O
easy O
for O
them O
not O
to O
be O
printed O
on O
the O
pistol O

jacket O
because O
it O
is O
rubber O

As O
regards O
the O
trajectory O
of O
the O
missile O
, O
they O
commented O
that O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
kill O
a O

forcing O
him O

- O
with O
the O

Furthermore O

they O
estimated O
that O
if O
the O
young O

boyfriend O
had O
tried O
to O
force O
her O
to O
shoot O
, O
signs O

admitted O

the O
need O

the O
reduction O

the O

, O
in O
the O

Von B-PER

when O

the O
Armed B-ORG

, O
for O
reasons O
of O

that O
of O

the O
former O

out O

it O

good O

decision O
so O
the O
committee O
opted O
to O
suggest O
that O
military O
service O
be O
maintained O

reducing O
the O

that O

According O
to O
the O
Court B-ORG
of O
First O

, O
the O

demonstrate O
that O
" O
the O

Thus O

" O
Most O

" O
China B-ORG

that O

The O

Thus O
, O
he O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
main O
problem O

Navratilova B-PER
assured O

future O
and O
that O
when O
she O
made O
the O
decision O
to O
play O

again O
she O
did O
it O
because O
she O
was O
afraid O
of O
all O
this O
. O

" O
I O
know O
I O
can O
still O
compete O
, O
and O
playing O

is O
easier O

taking O

I O
do O

want O
to O
beat O
any O

just O
have O

was O
four O

mid O

not O

with O
the O
Argentine O
Gabriela B-PER

- O
but O
in O
an O
hour O
. O
ten O
minutes O
solved O
their O

now O
they O

" O

it O

Advisor O
Guillermo B-PER
Fernández I-PER
Vara I-PER
announced O
today O
that O
the O
regional O
administration B-ORG
will O
propose O
a O
pact O
to O
health O
professionals O
in O
Extremadura B-LOC
" O
which O
will O
imply O
the O
need O
to O
approach O
the O

" O
. O

Fernández B-PER
Vara I-PER
participated O
today O
in O
Plasencia B-LOC
in O
a O
day O
organised O
by O
the O
health O
group O
of O
the O
PSOE B-ORG
Local I-ORG

, O
attended O
by O
half O
a O
hundred O
people O
, O
in O
order O
to O
discuss O
the O
health O
project O
for O
Extremadura B-LOC
prepared O
by O
this O
socialist O
group O
. O

The O
extreme O
counselor O
pointed O
out O
that O
health O
professionals O
are O
a O
key O
element O
in O
the O
creation O
of O
an O
extreme B-MISC
health I-MISC
model I-MISC
" O
and O
therefore O
- O
he O
said O
- O
we O
will O
make O
a O
pact O
with O
them O
, O
bearing O
in O
mind O
that O
a O
pact O
means O
negotiating O
objectives O
, O
especially O
because O
a O
hospital O
can O
not O
operate O
from O
eight O
. O
three O
as O
they O
are O
doing O
now O
" O
. O

" O
Because O
otherwise O
, O
he O
added O
, O
everyone O
should O
be O
at O
eight O
in O
perfect O
magazine O
status O
, O
and O
they O
are O
not O
, O
and O
of O
course O
I O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
with O
a O
list O
seeing O
what O
time O
people O
arrive O
because O
I O
think O
that O
model O
has O
failed O
outright O
" O
. O

He O
assured O
that O
the O
last O
purpose O
of O
this O
pact O
is O
that O
the O
professionals O
are O
responsible O
for O
specific O
objectives O
" O
and O
then O
it O
will O
be O
equal O
to O
us O
if O
they O
meet O
them O
in O
seven O
. O
in O
eight O
hours O
" O
and O
that O
the O
division O
between O
management O
and O
the O
clinic O
is O
broken O
" O
not O
as O
now O
it O
seems O
that O
management O
is O
the O
responsibility O
of O
some O
and O
the O
assistance O
of O
others O
" O
. O

Fernández B-PER
Vara I-PER
argued O
that O
in O
the O
Health B-MISC
Model I-MISC
of I-MISC
Extremadura I-MISC
competition O
must O
prevail O
and O
not O
competitiveness O
, O
" O
since O
- O
he O
said O
- O
public O
health O
must O
not O
compete O
with O
anyone O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
in O
order O
to O
be O
competitive O
and O
to O
ensure O
that O
people O
do O
not O
go O
to O
private O
healthcare O
" O
we O
need O
to O
give O
not O
only O
better O
treatment O
to O
diseases O
but O
better O
treatment O
to O
people O
" O
. O

The O
adviser O
stated O
that O
if O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
design O
a O
model O
among O
all O
the O
social O
actors O
" O
that O
at O
best O
is O
not O
the O
one O
that O
we O
would O
all O
individually O
want O
but O
that O
we O
understand O
as O
the O
least O
bad O
or O
the O
best O
, O
this O
will O
be O
a O
good O
starting O
point O
" O
. O

In O
this O
respect O
he O
pointed O
out O
that O
political O
leaders O
have O
an O
obligation O
to O
speak O
to O
people O
clearly O
" O
by O
making O
it O
clear O
that O
many O
things O
can O
be O
done O
but O
that O
not O
everything O
can O
be O
done O
, O
and O
not O
everything O
at O

in O
a O
match O
in O
which O
the O
host O
declared O
itself O
first O
in O
the O
group O
by O
winning O
in O
the O
three O
games O
it O
has O
played O
. O

The O
national O
team O
suffered O
a O
bad O
encounter O
, O
despite O
having O
made O
several O
changes O
during O
the O
game O
time O
and O
having O
put O
all O
their O
available O
players O
on O
the O
track O
. O

In O
the O
first O
set O
, O
Spain B-LOC
was O
very O
slow O
at O
the O
reception O
and O
was O
overtaken O
at O
all O
times O
by O
a O
Slovakia B-ORG
that O
demonstrated O
its O
quality O
on O
the O
track O
and O
gave O
a O
great O
blocking O
lesson O
to O
the O
Spanish O
players O
. O

In O
the O
match O
, O
the O
Slovak O
selection O
came O
to O
score O
five O
straight O
points O
of O
sack O
, O
through O
his O
player O
Kravaric B-PER
, O
which O
made O
it O
impossible O
to O
dream O
with O
a O
rebound O
by O
the O
Spanish O
team O
and O
was O
sublime O
in O
attack O
, O
thus O
merging O
the O
aspirations O
of O
the O
national O
team O
. O

The O
second O
set O
, O
which O
ended O
with O
a O
25 O
- O
23 O
on O
the O
marker O
, O
was O
more O
equal O
because O
Spain B-ORG
improved O
significantly O
in O
its O
reception O
. O

The O
exit O
from O
De B-PER
la I-PER
Fuente I-PER
to O
the O
track O
was O
an O
important O
point O
, O
as O
it O
returned O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
the O
lost O
concentration O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Spanish O
selection O
continued O
very O
irregularly O
and O
wasted O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
balloons O
that O
he O
pulled O
out O
of O
the O
net O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
another O
of O
the O
black O
points O
of O
the O
national O
combined O
was O
in O
the O
blockade O
, O
where O
he O
only O
managed O
to O
make O
two O
against O
the O
eleven O
of O
the O
Slovak O
selection O
. O

In O
the O
third O
set O
, O
which O
followed O
the O
same O
line O
of O
errors O
as O
the O
two O
previous O
ones O
, O
highlighted O
the O
presence O
on O
the O
track O
of O
Guillermo B-PER
Falazca I-PER
, O
who O
came O
in O
place O
of O

Rodríguez I-PER

who O
were O
the O
best O

the O
game O
. O

Despite O
the O
many O
changes O
made O
in O
the O
selection O
, O
the O
Slovak O
team O
was O
superior O
and O
thus O
placed O

Valencia I-ORG
arrested O
five O

part O
of O
an O
illegal O

According O

the O

It O

the O

Investigations O

For O
these O

had O
to O
pay O

the O

some O
230.000 O

which O
, O
in O
most O

were O
obtained O

For O
a O

One O
of O
the O

the O

The O
