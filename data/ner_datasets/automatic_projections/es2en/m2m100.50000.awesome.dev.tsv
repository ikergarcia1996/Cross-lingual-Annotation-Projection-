all O

the O
public O
followed O
with O

those O
of O
Castaño B-PER
, O
for O
his O
delivery O

cast O
, O
for O
the O
concept O
of O
toreo O
that O
practises O
, O
curvilineous O
and O
more O
and O
more O
inward O
, O
and O
for O
that O
exaggerated O
passion O
that O
makes O
him O
permanently O

of O
the O

, O
where O
it O

that O
it O

Everything O
in O

crossed O

Castaño B-PER
ran O
his O

So O
several O

were O
the O

It O
was O
a O
pity O
that O
the O

went O
to O

because O
it O
would O
have O
cut O
off O
an O

with O
all O

Of O

, O
the O
victory O
did O
not O
wait O
for O
the O
next O
. O

Castaño B-PER
ran O
out O
again O
with O
the O

And O
the O
mulet O
work O
was O
intense O
from O

he O
crossed O

placing O
himself O
even O
beyond O

Inverosimile O
the O

The O

that O

the O

its O

González B-PER

, O

The O
CNE B-ORG

he O
also O
mentioned O
the O

” O
the O

so O
that O
the O
scrutiny O

counting O

would O
be O
a O
disaster O

a O

would O
be O
unleashed O
that O

lead O
to O

two O

said O

the O

Egibar B-PER

that O

" O

For O
Otegi B-PER
, O
" O
if O
we O

that O
we O
all O
gather O
to O

that O
the O

Jorge B-PER

said O
today O
at O
a O
press O
conference O
that O
the O
volume O
of O
retention O
will O
depend O
on O
the O
behavior O
of O
the O
international O
price O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
your O
country O
, O
the O
retention O
will O
be O
a O
maximum O
of O
two O
million O
sacks O
a O

( O
four O
million O
for O
the O

years O
provided O
by O
the O
retention O
plan O
) O
over O
the O
ten O
million O
it O
expected O
to O
export O
. O

For O
Cárdenas B-PER
, O
the O
agreement O
relies O
more O
on O
controls O
on O
the O
need O
for O
coffee O
- O
producing O
nations O
to O
improve O
the O
external O
price O
, O
whose O
quotation O
puts O
this O
activity O
into O
question O
because O
the O
current O
price O
does O
not O
even O
compensate O
for O
production O
costs O
. O

The O
agreement O
includes O
members O
of O
the O
Association B-ORG
of I-ORG
Coffee I-ORG
Producing I-ORG
Countries I-ORG
( O
APPC B-ORG
) O
and O
other O
coffee O

, O
who O
, O
without O

partners O
, O
decided O
to O
join O
the O
agreement O
, O
in O
which O
85 O
percent O
of O
the O
world O
coffee O
production O
is O
represented O
. O

The O
33 O
signatories O
seek O
to O
recover O
the O
price O
by O
regulating O
and O
decreasing O
supply O
, O
even O
at O
levels O
below O
the O
current O
demand O
of O
the O
importing O
countries O
, O
the O
Colombian O
coffee O
maker O
said O
. O

According O
to O
the O
source O
, O
the O
drop O
in O
exportable O
supply O
at O
the O
top O
will O
mean O
an O
accumulation O
of O
inventories O
in O
the O
producing O
countries O
of O
about O
18 O
million O
sacks O
in O
the O
two O
years O
. O

It O
is O
estimated O
by O
the O
Colombian O
coffee O
authorities O
that O
non O
- O
producing O
consumer O
countries O
have O
inventories O
of O
between O
13 O
and O
14 O
million O
sacks O
, O
which O
if O
not O
retained O
would O
increase O
to O
18 O
or O
19 O
million O
. O

Cárdenas B-PER
said O
the O
plan O
is O
expected O
to O
reduce O
grain O
stocks O
in O
those O
countries O
to O
8 O
or O
9 O
million O
sacks O
. O

For O
the O
spokesman O
of O
Colombian O
growers O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
Brazil B-LOC
is O
among O
the O
first O
to O
apply O
the O
retention O
, O
which O
will O
be O
done O
by O
each O
country O
as O
far O
as O
their O
crops O
come O
out O
, O
will O
show O
the O
benefits O
of O
retention O
. O

The O
agreed O
mechanism O
establishes O
that O
from O
the O
average O
price O
of O
robust O
and O
Arabic O
coffee O
of O
$ O
0.69 O
the O
previous O
Friday O

will O
apply O
retention O
until O
the O
quotation O
rises O
to O
0.95 O
cents O
, O
level O
in O
which O
it O
will O
be O
suspended O
and O
if O
it O
comes O
to O
exceed O
the O
105 O
cents O
of O
the O

will O
be O
studied O
the O
possibility O
of O
releasing O
part O
of O
the O
retention O
to O
not O
affect O

. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
Colombian O
grain O
, O
with O
the O
mechanism O
the O
price O
can O
reach O
between O
$ O
1.35 O
and O
$ O
1.40 O
a O

. O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
the O

, O
of O

, O

Johnson B-PER
made O

during O

where O
the O

of O
half O
a O

in O
the O
state O
of O

is O
being O
carried O
out O
. O

According O
to O
the O
lawyer O
, O
it O
’s O
“ O
irreal O
” O
to O
think O
that O
tobacco O
companies O
can O
pay O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
in O
compensation O
to O
smokers O
and O
in O
the O
specific O
case O
of O
the O

fell O

by O
36 O

A O
jury O
on O
April O

determined O
that O
smoking O
caused O
cancer O
to O
three O
Florida B-LOC
smokers O
, O
and O
awarded O
them O
$ O
12.6 O
million O
in O
compensation O
. O

The O
verdict O
left O
the O
door O
open O
for O
the O
remaining O
half O
a O
million O
smokers O
to O
be O
heard O
in O
court O
and O
obtain O
compensation O
that O
the O
tobacco O
companies O
fear O
would O
amount O
to O
about O
$ O
300 O
billion O
. O

The O
same O
jury O
ruled O
in O
1999 O
that O
tobacco O
companies O
were O
responsible O
for O
the O
diseases O
linked O
to O
cigarettes O
, O
by O
manufacturing O
a O
faulty O
product O
that O
causes O
emphysema O
and O
lung O
cancer O
, O
among O
other O
diseases O
. O

According O
to O
analysts O
, O
the O
jury O
’s O
ruling O
could O
lead O
the O
U.S. O
tobacco O
industry O
to O
declare O
bankruptcy O
by O
facing O
the O
possibility O
of O
having O
to O
pay O
similar O
compensations O
. O

Fearing O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
trial O
, O
Florida B-LOC
lawmakers O
recently O
unanimously O
passed O
a O
law O
that O
will O
protect O
an O
agreement O
signed O
with O
the O
industry O
, O
for O
about O
$ O
11.3 O
billion O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
state O

medical O
costs O
for O
treating O
sick O

. O

Part O
of O
the O
funding O
, O
which O
has O
increased O
to O
$ O
13 O
billion O
, O
has O
been O
allocated O
to O
programs O
for O
children O

the O

. O

The O
law O
sets O
a O
limit O

100 O

on O
the O
bail O
that O

the O

what O

from O
the B-MISC
San I-MISC
Isidro I-MISC
Fair I-MISC
for O
an O
important O
performance O
today O
, O
commented O
to O
Efe B-ORG
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
feast O
that O
he O
felt O
“ O
a O
privileged O
for O

achieved O
the O
Puerta B-MISC

, O
the O
most O
quoted O
of O
the O
toreo O
” O
. O

The O
young O
tower O
explained O
to O
his O
once O
in O
the O
hotel O
how O
he O
had O
got O
the O
excitement O
when O
crossing O
the O
Puerta B-MISC
Grande I-MISC
, O
" O
so O
much O
that O
at O
the O
exit O
I O
did O
not O
see O
the O
van O
and O
I O
took O
a O
taxi O
. O

But O
I O
have O
tasted O
the O
exit O
on O
my O
shoulders O
, O
it O
was O
so O
beautiful O
as O
everyone O
touched O
me O
. O

In O
those O
moments O
I O
thought O
a O
lot O
that O
I O
had O
finally O
made O
the O
childhood O
dream O
that O
I O
always O
pursued O
a O
reality O
. O

It O
was O
an O
honor O
, O
” O
he O
exclaimed O
. O

By O
analyzing O
his O
performance O
as O
a O
whole O
, O
the O
Salmantine O
lamented O
his O
poor O
handling O
of O
the O
steels O
in O
his O
first O
. O

“ O
It O
’s O
a O
pity O
because O
my O
sword O
went O
very O
low O
and O
it O
was O
n’t O
my O
intention O
. O

People O
have O
behaved O
phenomenally O
and O
the O
sample O
has O
been O
the O
turn O
to O
the O
wheel O
so O
affectionate O
after O
losing O
the O
ear O
. O

That O
bull O
had O
quality O
for O
the O
left O
piton O
, O
although O
I O
had O
to O
tore O
it O
very O
well O
and O
I O
was O
determined O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

But O
the O
great O
one O
came O
in O
the O
sixth O
, O
to O
whom O
he O
cut O
off O
his O
two O
ears O
unanimously O
. O

“ O
He O
was O
an O
extraordinary O
calf O
, O
with O
a O
good O
class O
and O
we O
must O
congratulate O
the O
farmer O
, O
César B-PER
Rincón I-PER
. O

The O
animal O
asked O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
temple O
and O
I O
gave O
it O
and O
found O
myself O
very O
, O
very O
pleasant O
. O

It O
was O
impressive O
, O
” O
he O
added O
. O

Javier B-PER
Castaño I-PER
wanted O
to O
dedicate O
this O
triumph O
to O
himself O
, O
" O
for O
the O
amount O
of O

I O

been O
fighting O

this O

strong O
today O

I O

Even O
when O

would O
be O
willing O
to O
occupy O
the O
low O
of O
Sergio B-PER
Aguilar I-PER
in O
the O
next O

he O

with O
the O
serious O
gesture O
that O
characterizes O
him O

with O
rotundity O
and O
immediateness O
: O
" O
Of O

Víctor B-PER

Serna I-PER
, O
rather O
disgusted O
. O

The O
afternoon O
was O
complicated O
, O
because O
in O
my O
first O
I O
found O
myself O
well O
, O
centered O
on O
the O
right O
side O
, O
although O
with O
the O
defect O
that O
the O
animal O
pointed O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
muletazo O
. O

I O
switched O
to O
the O
left O
and O
at O
the O
second O
stroke O
I O
stumbled O
upon O
the O
deceit O
and O
the O
job O
came O
down O
. O

The O
other O
was O
a O
gentle O
man O
who O
remained O
untouched O
, O
brown O
and O
I O
think O
it O
was O
the O
black O
garbage O
of O
the O
lock O
. O

Without O
class O
and O
I O
did O
n’t O
even O
connect O
with O
him O
, O
” O
he O
pointed O
out O
. O

The O
most O
disappointed O
was O
the O
Frenchman O
Sebastián B-PER
Castella I-PER
, O
who O
barely O
had O
words O
to O
explain O
his O
performance O
. O

“ O
The O
game O

good O

I O
have O
little O

say O
about O
myself O

My O
first O
was O
good O

I O
did O

connect O

it O
on O

I O
got O
it O
in O
the O
second O
part O
of O

job O
when O
everything O
had O
already O
turned O
off O

that O
’s O
why O

no O

anything O

, O
last O

his O

based O
on O
the O

that O

no O

registered O

raised O
in O

the O

for O
the O

reasons O

for O
considering O
that O

not O
meet O
the O

conditions O
to O
be O
considered O
clean O
, O
just O

Bustamante B-PER

pronounced O
about O

He O
said O
it O
is O
" O
a O
possibility O
" O
that O
the O

change O
its O
opinion O
. O

The O
prime O

excluded O
that O
a O
" O

" O
could O
be O
given O
to O
the O
problem O
that O
, O
according O
to O

, O
has O
triggered O
a O
crisis O
in O
Peru B-LOC
. O

A O
political O
exit O
must O
always O
be O
given O
within O
the O
context O
of O
applicable O
legislation O
. O

In O
this O
case O
we O
have O
Article O
111 O
of O
the O
Constitution B-MISC
that O
clearly O
speaks O
of O
30 O
days O
after O
the O
delivery O
of O
the O
elections O
and O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
by O
finding O
this O
Article O
111 O
within O
the O

of O
the O

it O
can O

it O

so O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

According O
to O
Bustamante B-PER
’s O
interpretation O
, O
which O
has O
been O
the O
criterion O
applied O
by O
the O
JNE B-ORG
, O
the O
official O
result O
of O
the O
presidential O
vote O
that O
took O
place O
at O
the O
end O
of O
last O
month O
constituted O
the O
end O
of O
the O
electoral O
process O
in O
that O
regard O
. O

The O
electoral O
law O
stipulates O
that O
the O
second O
round O
for O
the O

of O
the O
country O
, O
when O
none O
of O
the O
candidates O
has O
obtained O
half O
plus O
one O
of O
the O
votes O
, O
must O
be O
held O
within O
30 O
days O
of O
the O
proclamation O
of O
the O
official O
results O
. O

The O
other O
interpretation O
of O
the O
law O
, O
which O
was O
the O
argument O
presented O
by O
Toledo B-PER
to O
the O
JNE B-ORG
to O
request O
the O
postponement O
, O
considers O
that O
the O
process O
of O
general O
elections O
– O
presidential O
and O
legislative O
– O
is O
one O
and O
ends O
only O
when O
the O
total O
results O
are O
given O
, O
for O
the O
presidency O
and O
Congress B-ORG
, O
which O
, O
he O
said O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
occurred O
. O

Bustamante B-PER
reiterated O
that O
this O
argument O
is O
not O
valid O
and O
that O
the O
deadline O
must O
be O
counted O
from O
the O
date O
on O
which O
the O

After O
the O
apotheosis O

Sunday O
in O
this O

given O
the O

the O

everything O
indicated O
that O
the O

would O
also O
take O

But O
it O
was O
not O
so O
for O
the O

. O

Neither O
" O
Antoñete B-PER
" O
nor O
Curro B-PER
found O
moments O
of O
inspiration O
except O
some O
passages O
by O
the O
genius O
that O
brought O
out O
the O
bulls O
of O
Arjona B-PER
. O

So O
the O
only O
trophy O
was O
to O
stop O
the O
rejoiner O
Pablo O
Beautiful O
of B-PER
Mendoza I-PER
who O
had O
moments O
of O
brightness O
in O
his O
two O
bulls O
, O
although O
he O
claved O
more O
ceretro O
in O
his O
second O
, O
a O
gentle O
and O
heated O
in O
tables O
, O
with O
which O
he O
exposed O
mounting O
" O
Cagancho B-MISC
" O
. O

This O
time O
he O
also O
killed O
the O
first O
of O
those O
ears O
. O

" O
Antoñete B-PER
" O
had O
a O
first O
good O
bull O
, O
which O
he O
received O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
good O
veronics O
and O
then O
highlighted O
two O
series O
one O
on O
the O
right O
and O
another O
on O
the O
natural O
of O
great O
quality O
and O
plasticity O
. O

However O
, O
the O
possible O
trophy O
did O
not O
arrive O
because O
of O
its O
misuse O
with O
the O
sword O
. O

The O
fifth O
brought O
out O
more O
genius O
and O
caste O
and O
found O
no O
coupling O
. O

He O
also O
injured O
his O
doll O
when O
he O
entered O
to O
kill O
and O
passed O
a O
calvary O
to O
end O
the O
stake O
. O

Also O
in O
the O
greeting O
to O
his O
first O
, O
Curro B-PER
Romero I-PER
highlighted O
for O
his O
release O
of O
arms O
and O
magisterium O
to O
interpret O
the O
toreo O
to O
the O
veronica O
. O

But O
it O
was O
all O
, O
because O
even O
the O
genius O
of O
his O
opponent O
made O
him O
shorten O
without O
more O
. O

Something O
similar O
to O
his O
second O
, O
who O
received O
a O
harsh O
punishment O
in O
varas O
. O

He O
attempted O
it O
, O
although O
again O
without O
coming O
to O
structuralize O
his O
work O
as O
he O
saw O
that O
it O
was O
not O
his O
suitable O

that O

that O

While O
for O
some O

the O
fact O
that O

should O
partially O
alleviate O

fears O

( O
since O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
drops O
of O
recent O

are O
not O
too O
representative O
) O
, O
others O
believe O
that O
anyway O
, O
with O
high O
or O
low O
volume O
of O
trades O
, O
low O
magnitude O
of O
today O
's O
are O
always O
a O
source O
of O
concern O
. O

According O
to O

, O

remain O
very O
concerned O
about O
the O
future O

rates O
following O
the O

It O

that O
new O

increases O
( O
which O
appear O
to O
be O
in O

) O
could O
affect O
