The O
Espanyol B-ORG
squad O
has O
made O
this O
morning O
the O
first O
training O
in O
the O
concentration O
that O
began O
yesterday O
Monday O
at O
the O
facilities O
of O
the O
complex O
La B-ORG
Manga I-ORG
Club I-ORG
, O
located O
in O
the O
Murcian O
town O
of O
Los B-LOC
Belones I-LOC
. O

This O
concentration O
is O
done O
to O
prepare O
for O
the O
final O
match O
of O
the O
Copa B-MISC
del I-MISC
Rey I-MISC
to O
be O
played O
next O
Saturday O
against O
Atletico B-ORG
Madrid I-ORG
. O

The O
session O
of O
the O
blue O
and O
white O
team O
lasted O
for O
two O
hours O
and O
in O
it O
the O
coach O
, O
Paco B-PER
Flores I-PER
, O
arranged O
an O
eminently O
physical O
work O
, O
although O
the O
players O
also O
played O
ball O
. O

The O
main O
novelty O
of O
the O
day O
was O
, O
precisely O
, O
the O
use O
of O
the O
ball O
that O
will O
be O
used O
in O
the O
next O
European B-MISC
Championship I-MISC
in O
Belgium B-LOC
and O
Holland B-LOC
. O

The O
same O
, O
made O
by O
Adidas B-MISC
and O
manufactured O
in O
Morocco B-LOC
, O
will O
be O
released O
for O
Spain B-LOC
in O
the O
final O
of O
the O
Copa B-MISC
del I-MISC
Rey I-MISC
. O

After O
the O
training O
, O
Flores B-PER
himself O
spoke O
about O
the O
characteristics O
of O
the O
new O
ball O
and O
said O
that O
" O
it O
is O
totally O
different O
from O
the O
one O
used O
in O
La O
Liga B-MISC
. O

With O
it O
you O
gain O
in O
effect O
, O
but O
you O
lose O
in O
speed O
" O
. O

" O
In O
any O
case O
, O
my O
team O
, O
like O
Atletico B-ORG
, O
has O
a O
week O
to O
adapt O
to O
it O
and O
we O
have O
to O
get O
used O
to O
its O
use O
in O
that O
short O
period O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

Referring O
to O
the O
place O
of O
concentration O
, O
the O
Principe B-LOC
Felipe I-LOC
hotel I-LOC
and O
its O
surroundings O
, O
Flores B-PER
said O
that O
" O
it O
is O
a O
wonderful O
and O
ideal O
place O
to O
prepare O
for O
a O
match O
of O
the O
caliber O
that O
will O
be O
played O
on O
Saturday O
" O
. O

The O
Espanyol O
coach O
also O
alluded O
to O
the O
absence O
of O
defender O
Toni B-PER
Soldevila I-PER
, O
injured O
last O
Friday O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
we O
must O
accept O
that O
we O
can O
not O
count O
on O
him O
and O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
want O
at O
this O
time O
for O
him O
is O
to O
get O
better O
from O
his O
injury O
in O
the O
shortest O
possible O
time O
. O

That O
is O
why O
he O
has O
stayed O
in O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
because O
there O
we O
have O
enough O
means O
for O
his O
recovery O
: O
laser O
devices O
, O
radar O
and O
ultrasound O
" O
. O

The O
espanyolista O
squad O
will O
return O
to O
work O
tomorrow O
morning O
at O
the O
soccer O
center O
of O
La B-LOC
Manga I-LOC
Club I-LOC
complex O
, O
while O
the O
afternoons O
are O
aimed O
at O
the O
recovery O
of O
the O
players O
, O
as O
noted O
Carlos B-PER
Lorenzano I-PER
, O
physical O
trainer O
of O
the O
club O
. O

On O
the O
work O
scheduled O
for O
the O
coming O
days O
, O
Flores B-PER
said O
: O
" O
with O
it O
we O
will O
try O
to O
gain O
in O
speed O
, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
virtues O
that O
this O
team O
has O
. O

We O
will O
also O
study O
Atlético B-ORG
de I-ORG
Madrid I-ORG
, O
who O
in O
their O
last O
visits O
to O
Oviedo B-LOC
and O
Palma B-LOC
de I-LOC
Mallorca I-LOC
have O
experienced O
a O
remarkable O
improvement O
in O
their O
game O
. O

Whenever O
a O
squad O
changes O
coach O
, O
it O
usually O
increases O
its O
performance O
and O
, O
respecting O
Antic B-PER
, O
I O
think O
that O
Atletico B-ORG
is O
benefiting O
from O
the O
arrival O
of O
Zambrano B-PER
" O
. O

Flores B-PER
thinks O
that O
Espanyol B-ORG
's O
concentration O
is O
favorable O
to O
flee O
from O
the O
" O
euphoria O
" O
that O
has O
meant O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
Blue O
and O
Whites O
in O
the O
cup O
final O
. O

" O
Being O
distant O
from O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
the O
feeling O
of O
euphoria O
is O
also O
distant O
. O

I O
try O
not O
to O
read O
the O
press O
and O
I O
prefer O
that O
my O
players O
do O
not O
do O
it O
either O
to O
prevent O
them O
from O
catching O
the O
feelings O
that O
are O
outside O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
I O
will O
try O
to O
put O
all O
the O
pressure O
on O
me O
and O
not O
on O
my O
players O
, O
so O
that O
they O
can O
show O
the O
soccer O
they O
have O
inside O
them O
" O
, O
explained O
Flores B-PER
. O

He O
also O
acknowledged O
: O
" O
What O
interests O
me O
most O
is O
to O
motivate O
the O
eleven O
who O
will O
take O
the O
field O
against O
Atlético B-ORG
, O
because O
they O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
will O
feed O
us O
. O

I O
want O
everyone O
to O
know O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
be O
in O
the O
lineup O
. O

In O
short O
, O
I O
want O
to O
value O
what O
it O
costs O
to O
be O
a O
starter O
and O
that O
those O
who O
are O
cling O
to O
that O
condition O
not O
to O
abandon O
it O
. O

The O
coach O
of O
Espanyol B-ORG
said O
: O
" O
I O
always O
bet O
on O
my O
team O
and O
woe O
betide O
the O
coach O
who O
does O
not O
, O
because O
he O
will O
have O
lost O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
game O
" O
and O
clarified O
that O
" O
between O
my O
team O
and O
Atletico B-ORG
there O
are O
no O
differences O
in O
the O
physical O
aspect O
, O
although O
perhaps O
there O
are O
in O
the O

It O
is O
feared O

which O
seems O
to O
be O
on O
the O
minds O
of O

could O

In O
yesterday O

, O
this O
fear O
caused O
a O
very O
strong O
decline O
during O
most O
of O
the O
day O
, O
but O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
a O
stream O
of O
purchases O
at O
low O

prevented O
a O
large O

decline O

In O
today O

, O
the O

moved O
between O
pessimism O
about O
the O
future O
of O

a O
certain O

generated O
by O
yesterday O

last O

. O

Despite O
this O
, O
the O
general O
characteristic O
of O
the O
market O
is O
the O
real O
" O
apathy O
" O
of O

aspire O

that O
a O
working O
group O
has O
been O
formed O
to O
end O
this O

shows O
that O
" O
the O

that O
the O
former O

José B-PER

, O
were O
not O

" O
. O

According O
to O
Valentin B-PER
, O
the O
parameters O
used O
by O
Health B-MISC
to O
provide O
data O
on O
waiting O
lists O
, O
with O
concepts O
such O
as O
the O
average O
delay O
, O
should O
be O
changed O
, O
while O
advocated O
a O
thorough O
analysis O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
there O
is O
delay O
in O
each O
service O
. O

Another O
of O
the O
proposals O
made O
by O
the O

the O
opening O

Finally O
, O
Valentin B-PER
said O
that O
the O

today O

that O
the O
policy O
followed O
by O
the O

has O
so O
far O
been O
characterized O
by O
the O
" O
systematic O

of O
the O

" O
and O
the O
indiscriminate O
assessment O
of O

for O
all O

on O

without O
taking O
into O

the O

For O
the O
FADSP B-ORG
, O
it O
is O
not O
so O
much O
a O
question O
of O

disappearing O
, O
but O
that O
they O
become O
rational O
, O

are O
not O
excessive O
and O

adjusted O

he O
acknowledged O
that O
the O
eradication O
of O
illegal O
coca O
crops O
may O
cause O
unemployment O
and O
poverty O
effects O
at O
rates O
higher O
than O
those O
currently O
endured O
by O

and O
" O
if O
alternatives O
are O
not O
given O
in O
the O
coming O
years O
there O
could O
be O
problems O
" O
of O
social O
violence O
. O

According O
to O
him O
, O
the O
control O
of O
the O
coca O
leaf O
trade O
and O
the O
enactment O
of O
a O
new O
Customs B-MISC
Law I-MISC
, O
which O
combats O

at O
the O

, O
are O
the O
causes O
of O
the O
greatest O
social O
unrest O
since O
the O
end O
of O
last O

. O

This O
situation O
should O
be O
recognized O
by O

countries O
to O
help O
Bolivia B-LOC
and O
find O
a O
way O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the O
resources O
that O
the O
country O
is O
losing O
due O
to O
cocaine O

which O
are O
estimated O
at O
around O
8 O
percent O
of O
the O

until O

, O
said O
the O

Fortun B-PER
noted O
that O
Bolivia B-LOC
is O
paying O
a O
high O
price O
in O
the O
fight O
against O
drug O
trafficking O
, O
as O
the O
increase O
in O
consumption O
of O

among O
its O
youth O
population O
, O
but O
clarified O
that O
it O
has O
not O
been O
the O
same O
as O
other O
countries O
where O
social O
violence O
has O
manifested O
itself O
in O
the O

According O
to O

estimates O
, O
the O

5,100 O

, O
in O

now O
located O
in O

The O

said O
that O
these O

are O
defended O
by O
peasant O

with O
" O

was O
optimistic O
that O

Dr. O
Philippe B-PER
Desjeux I-PER
, O
WHO B-ORG
specialist O
, O
told O
EFE B-ORG
that O
the O
cities O
in O
Spain B-LOC
where O
there O
have O
been O
more O
cases O
of O
double O
infection O
are O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
Seville O
and O
Granada B-LOC
. O

In O
this O
regard O
he O
explained O
that O
in O
Spain B-LOC
there O
is O
a O
network O
of O
surveillance O
laboratories O
" O
that O
works O
well O
" O
so O
more O
cases O
are O
detected O
than O
in O
other O
countries O
and O
noted O
that O
Spanish O
researchers O
were O
the O
first O
to O
alert O
of O
this O
problem O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Spain B-LOC
has O
a O
higher O
rate O
of O
AIDS O
patients O
than O
Europe O
and O
many O
of O
those O
who O
suffer O
from O
it O
are O
intravenous O
drug O
addicts O
. O

Leishmaniasis O
was O
until O
now O
a O
veterinary O
problem O
in O
the O
Mediterranean B-MISC
, O
as O
it O
was O
mainly O
suffered O
by O
dogs O
, O
infected O
by O
mosquitoes O
. O

However O
, O
said O
Desjeux B-PER
, O
now O
there O
has O
been O
a O
change O
because O
when O
an O
intravenous O
drug O
addict O
contracts O
leishmaniasis O
, O
he O
himself O
becomes O
a O
source O
of O
infection O
through O
the O
sharing O
of O
syringes O
. O

The O
most O
serious O
type O
of O
leishmaniasis O
is O
called O
visceral O
leishmaniasis O
( O
VL B-MISC
) O
, O
with O
a O
one O
hundred O
percent O
mortality O
rate O
if O
left O
untreated O
, O
and O
a O
mutually O
reinforcing O
circle O
is O
established O
between O
it O
and O
AIDS O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
VL B-MISC
makes O
the O
manifestation O
of O
AIDS O
faster O
and O
reduces O
the O
life O
expectancy O
of O
people O
infected O
by O
the O
Human B-MISC
Immunodeficiency I-MISC
Virus I-MISC
( O
HIV B-MISC
) O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
HIV B-MISC
favors O
the O
spread O
of O
this O
type O
of O
leishmaniasis O
. O

The O
two O
conjugate O
infections O
cause O
a O
double O
immunodeficiency O
because O
leishmaniasis O
and O
HIV B-MISC
destroy O
the O
same O
cells O
, O
so O
that O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
its O
consequences O
increase O
exponentially O
. O

The O
co O
- O
infection O
of O
AIDS O

leishmaniasis O
affects O
the O
whole O

and O
, O
for O
example O
in O

America B-LOC
the O

for O

the O

Leishmaniasis O
is O
a O

that O
a O

without O

but O
in O

this O

Dr. O
Philippe B-PER
Desjeux I-PER
, O
a O
WHO B-ORG
specialist O

told O

that O
the O
cities O
in O

most O

have O
been O
recorded O
are O
Barcelona B-LOC
, O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
Seville O
and O
Granada B-LOC
. O

He O
explained O
that O
in O
Spain B-LOC
there O
is O
a O
network O
of O
surveillance O
laboratories O
" O
that O
works O
well O
" O
so O
more O
cases O
are O
detected O
than O
in O
other O
countries O
and O
noted O
that O
Spanish O
researchers O
were O
the O
first O
to O
alert O
of O
this O
problem O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Spain B-LOC
has O
a O
higher O
rate O
of O
AIDS O
patients O
than O
Europe O
and O
many O
of O
those O
who O
suffer O
from O
it O
are O
intravenous O
drug O
addicts O
. O

Leishmaniasis O
was O
until O
now O
a O
veterinary O
problem O
in O
the O
Mediterranean B-LOC
, O
as O
it O
was O
mainly O
suffered O
by O
dogs O
, O
infected O
by O
mosquitoes O
. O

However O
, O
said O
Desjeux B-PER
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
change O
because O
when O
an O
intravenous O
drug O
addict O
contracts O
leishmaniasis O
, O
he O
himself O
becomes O
a O
source O
of O
infection O
through O
the O
sharing O
of O
syringes O
. O

The O
most O
serious O
type O
of O
leishmaniasis O
is O
called O
visceral O
leishmaniasis O
( O
VL B-MISC
) O
, O
with O
a O
one O
hundred O
percent O
mortality O
rate O
if O
not O
treated O
, O
and O
a O
circle O
of O
mutual O
reinforcement O
is O
established O
between O
it O
and O
AIDS O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
VL B-MISC
makes O
the O
manifestation O
of O
AIDS O
faster O
and O
reduces O
the O
life O
expectancy O
of O
people O
infected O
by O
the O
Human B-MISC
Immunodeficiency I-MISC
Virus I-MISC
( O
HIV B-MISC
) O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
HIV B-MISC
favors O
the O
spread O
of O
this O
type O
of O
leishmaniasis O
. O

The O
two O
conjugate O
infections O
cause O
a O
double O
immunodeficiency O
because O
leishmaniasis O
and O
HIV B-MISC
destroy O
the O
same O
cells O
, O
so O
that O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
disease O
and O
its O
consequences O
increase O
exponentially O
. O

The O
co O
- O
infection O
of O
AIDS O
and O
leishmaniasis O
affects O
the O
whole O
world O
and O
, O
for O
example O
in O
Latin O
America B-LOC
the O
highest O
number O
of O
cases O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
Brazil B-LOC
. O

As O
for O
Africa B-LOC
, O
the O
number O
of O
reported O
cases O
gives O
" O
a O
very O
modest O
estimate O
" O
, O
which O
would O
be O
considerably O
higher O
if O

were O
greater O

The O

particular O
problems O

that O

the O

This O

the O

rise O

the O

at O

while O
on O

the O

at O

, O
the O
speakers O
of O
the O

said O
that O
this O
type O
of O
travel O
" O
will O
become O
a O

Sarah B-PER
Dalton I-PER
, O
after O
underlining O
this O
possibility O
, O
said O
that O
her O
company O
already O
offers O
" O
zero O

" O
trips O
, O
currently O
" O
accessible O
to O
a O
few O
" O
because O
of O
their O
high O
prices O
, O
but O
that O
" O
will O
be O
extensible O
to O
society O
within O
a O
few O
decades O
when O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
costs O
are O
economized O
" O
. O

This O
company O
organizes O
flights O
where O
passengers O
experience O
the O
absence O
of O
gravity O
, O
at O
about O
80,000 O
feet O
, O
but O
the O
prices O
" O
are O
almost O
prohibitive O
, O
" O
since O
they O
have O
a O
cost O
of O
two O
million O

" O
for O
a O

of O
just O
a O

According O
to O
Dalton B-PER
, O
the O
next O
step O
, O
which O
could O
take O
place O
within O
three O

five O

, O
will O
be O
suborbital O

The O
next O
step O
, O
at O
least O
ten O
years O
away O
, O
said O
Dalton B-PER
, O
will O
be O
the O
construction O
of O

, O
an O
initiative O
that O
is O
already O
working O
the O
National B-ORG

of I-ORG
Japan I-ORG
( O
NASDA B-ORG
) O
, O
whose O
special O
investigator O
Patrick B-PER
Collins I-PER
today O
lamented O
the O
lack O
of O
investment O
initiative O
in O
this O
regard O
. O

Collins B-PER
said O
that O
" O
25 O
trillion O
pesetas O
are O
collected O
worldwide O
from O
the O
taxes O
of O
citizens O
for O
space O
research O
, O
but O
so O
far O
no O
official O
funds O
are O
allocated O
to O
advance O
in O
this O
way O
, O
which O
has O
enormous O
potential O
for O
the O
future O
" O
. O

This O
researcher O
stressed O
that O
" O
if O
work O
in O
this O
field O
were O
to O
begin O
now O
, O
the O
first O
space O
hotel O
would O
be O
a O
reality O
in O
ten O
years O
, O
" O
so O
he O
predicted O
that O
within O
two O
decades O
a O
group O
of O
select O
tourists O
could O
spend O
two O
days O
of O
vacation O
in O
a O
space O
hotel O
for O
a O
price O
of O
three O
million O
pesetas O
. O

Embarking O
on O
a O
journey O
into O
the O
unknown O
, O
breaking O
the O
barriers O
of O
space O
, O
experiencing O
the O
absence O
of O
gravity O
or O
seeing O
a O
sunset O
every O
ninety O
minutes O
are O
" O
attractive O
enough O
" O
to O
attract O
tourists O
, O
although O
for O
the O
moment O
they O
can O
only O
be O
of O
high O
purchasing O
power O
, O
agreed O
in O
their O
presentations O
. O

However O
, O
the O
forecasts O
of O
those O
already O
working O
in O
the O
field O
of O
space O
tourism O
go O
further O
, O
as O
they O
are O
thinking O
of O
building O
sports O
fields O
in O
space O
, O
a O
challenge O
that O
, O
according O
to O
their O
interventions O
, O
" O

imagine O

a O

after O
several O

today O
some O
reaped O

0.52 O

both O

" O
The O

" O
Alemán B-PER

He O
pointed O
out O

more O
endless O

nor O
do O

already O
offers O
" O
zero O

" O

currently O
" O

that O
" O

when O
, O
of O

This O

organizes O
flights O
where O
passengers O
experience O
the O
absence O
of O

, O
at O
about O
80,000 O

, O
but O
the O
prices O

According O
to O

, O
the O
next O

, O
will O
be O

The O
next O
step O
, O
at O
least O
ten O
years O
away O
, O
said O
Dalton B-PER
, O
will O
be O
the O
construction O
of O

, O
an O
initiative O
that O
is O
already O
working O
the O
National B-ORG

, O
whose O
special O
investigator O
Patrick B-PER
Collins I-PER
today O
lamented O
the O
lack O
of O

initiative O
in O
this O
regard O
. O

Collins B-PER
said O
that O
" O
25 O
trillion O
pesetas O
are O
collected O
worldwide O
from O
the O
taxes O
of O
citizens O
for O
space O
research O
, O
but O
so O
far O
no O
official O
funds O
are O
allocated O
to O
advance O
in O
this O
way O
, O
which O
has O
enormous O
potential O
for O
the O
future O
" O
. O

This O
researcher O
stressed O
that O
" O
if O
work O
in O
this O
field O
were O
to O
begin O
now O
, O
the O
first O
space O
hotel O
would O
be O
a O
reality O
in O
ten O
years O
, O
" O
so O
he O
predicted O
that O
within O
two O
decades O
a O
group O
of O
select O
tourists O
could O
spend O
two O
days O
of O
vacation O
in O
a O

for O
a O
price O
of O
three O

Embarking O
on O
a O

into O
the O
unknown O
, O
breaking O
the O

of O

, O
experiencing O
the O
absence O
of O
gravity O
or O
seeing O
a O
sunset O
every O
ninety O
minutes O
are O
" O
attractive O
enough O
" O
to O
attract O

, O
although O
for O
the O

they O
can O
only O
be O
of O
high O
purchasing O
power O
, O
agreed O

However O
, O
the O
forecasts O
of O
those O
already O
working O
in O
the O
field O
of O

go O
further O
, O
as O
they O
are O
thinking O
about O
the O
construction O
of O
sports O

, O
a O
challenge O
that O
, O
according O

that O

with O

said O
today O
he O
was O
in O

not O
to O
reduce O

After O

Rato B-PER
said O
the O
best O

to O
facilitate O
greater O

" O
I O

to O
increase O

" O
Rato B-PER

to O
resort O

" O
what O

have O
made O
several O

the O

" O
the O
