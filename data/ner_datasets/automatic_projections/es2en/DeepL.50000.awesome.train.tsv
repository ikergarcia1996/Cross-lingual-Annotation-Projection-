today O
stressed O
the O
need O
to O
take O
steps O
to O
protect O
the O

an O
Internet O
page O
that O
makes O
it O

with O
the O

The O
Attorney B-PER
General I-PER
's O
request O
comes O
after O
a O

of O
the O

of O
Victoria B-LOC
( O
Australia B-LOC

was O
forced O

dissolve O
a O
popular O

suspend O
the O

in O
the O

of O
the O
defense O
's O
argument O
that O
the O

who O
composed O
it O
could O
have O
obtained O
information O
about O
the O

through O
the O
CrimeNet B-MISC

This O

there O

out O

on O

the O

that O

as O
possible O

of O
prejudices O
, O
willing O
to O
accept O
the O
good O
things O
of O
others O
without O
denying O
their O
own O
. O

But O
this O
universality O
of O
the O
gastronome O
- O
the O
first O
to O
universalize O
gastronomy O
were O
the O
Romans O
- O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
renunciation O
of O
one O
's O
own O
. O

Much O
less O
the O
absurd O
mixtures O
, O
that O
cuisine O
that O
today O
we O
call O
' O
fusion O
' O
, O
very O
defensible O
. O
when O
it O
does O
not O
derive O
, O
as O
in O
so O
many O
cases O
, O
in O
' O
confusion O
' O
cuisine O
. O

We O
will O
always O
insist O
that O
a O
cuisine O
, O
to O
be O
truly O
great O
, O
must O
be O
faithful O
to O
its O
land O
, O
and O
also O
to O
its O
time O
. O

But O
it O
must O
, O
of O
course O
, O
be O
open O
to O
foreign O
incorporations O
. O

What O
would O
European O
cuisine O
be O
without O
potatoes O
, O
for O
example O
, O
or O
Mediterranean O
cuisine O
without O
tomatoes O
, O
both O
products O
that O
arrived O
in O
the O
Old B-MISC
World I-MISC
less O
than O
five O
centuries O
ago O
? O

Imagine O
that O
among O
those O
Spaniards O
, O
who O
were O
the O
ones O
who O
brought O
those O
American O
gifts O
to O
Europe B-LOC
, O
gastronomic O
patriotism O
would O
have O
prevailed O
: O
potatoes O
and O
tomatoes O
would O
have O
remained O
botanical O
curiosities O
. O

There O
is O
not O
, O
there O
can O
not O
be O
, O
a O
universal O
cuisine O
; O
remember O
that O
horror O
known O
as O
' O
international O
cuisine O
' O
so O
frequent O
in O
hotel O
restaurants O
. O

But O
neither O
can O
there O
be O
a O
cuisine O
closed O
in O
on O
itself O
. O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
ask O
oneself O
, O
when O
faced O
with O
a O
new O
food O
, O
a O
new O
spice O
, O
where O
does O
it O
come O
from O
? O
without O
first O
investigating O
what O
is O
really O
important O
: O
is O
it O
tasty O
? O

Well O
, O
if O
it O
tastes O
good O
... O
go O
ahead O
, O
wherever O
it O
comes O
from O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
study O
how O
we O
adapt O
this O
new O
product O
to O
our O
most O
deeply O
rooted O
culinary O
uses O
. O

Thus O
, O
our O
cuisine O
evolves O
, O
enriches O
itself O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
by O
closing O
in O
on O
itself O
, O
it O
ends O
up O
weakening O
and O
becoming O
extinct O
; O
inbreeding O
is O
not O
good O
for O
almost O
anything O
. O

So O
keep O
an O
open O
mind O
, O
and O
your O
senses O
even O
more O
so O
. O

That O
, O
to O
paraphrase O
Shakespeare B-PER
in O
' O
Hamlet B-MISC
' O
, O
there O
are O
richer O
things O
on O
earth B-MISC
than O
your O
wisdom O
, O
or O
your O
personal O
experience O
reaches O
. O

Do O
not O
become O
eunuchs O
of O
taste O
by O
mere O
jingoism O
: O
you O
will O
miss O
so O
many O
rich O

Although O
Beirut B-ORG
considers O
that O
the O
Israeli O

is O
incomplete O
, O
because O
it O
did O
not O
include O
the O

Israel B-ORG
and O
the O
UN B-ORG
claim O
that O
these O

Syrian O

but O
Damascus O
and O
Beirut B-LOC
claim O
that O
they O

, O
to O
that O

, O
the O

sent O
several O

The O
leader O
of O
Hezbollah B-ORG
, O
Sheikh O
Hasan B-PER
Nasrala I-PER
, O
for O
his O

announced O
that O

In O

threatened O

in O

of O

referring O

the O
" O

preponderant O

in O

where O

about O

a O

a O

Israel B-ORG
's O
withdrawal O
from O
the O
south O
was O
part O
of O
the O
strategy O
of O
Israeli O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
Ehud B-PER
Barak I-PER
, O
to O
force O
Syria B-ORG
in O
its O
negotiations O
on O
the O
Golan B-LOC
, O
occupied O
by O
Israel B-ORG
in O
1967 O
and O
annexed O
in O
1981 O
. O

In O
theory O
, O
Syria B-ORG
is O
harmed O
by O
the O
unilateral O
Israeli O
withdrawal O
from O
southern O
Lebanon O
, O
as O
it O
deprives O
Damascus O
of O
a O
card O
that O
it O
used O
, O
through O
Hezbollah B-ORG
, O
to O
put O
pressure O
on O
Israel B-ORG
. O

However O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
Damascus B-ORG
, O
which O
is O
adamant O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
return O
of O
the O
Golan B-LOC
to O
the O
pre O
- O
June O
1967 O
demarcation O
line O
, O
appears O
to O
have O
forced O
Israel B-ORG
to O
execute O
its O
threat O
and O
has O
been O
strengthened O
in O
its O
control O
of O
Lebanon B-LOC
. O

If O
Israel B-ORG
occupied O
ten O
percent O
of O
Lebanese O
territory O
, O
Syrian O
troops O
are O
deployed O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
and O
it O
is O
not O
ruled O
out O
that O
they O
could O
be O
assigned O
a O
mission O
in O
southern O
Lebanon B-LOC
, O
thus O
complicating O
their O
withdrawal O
, O
despite O
the O
desire O
of O
a O
majority O
of O
Lebanese O
. O

The O
major O
powers O
assigned O
to O
Syria B-ORG
the O
role O
of O
guardian O
of O
Lebanon B-LOC
and O
know O
that O
if O
it O
does O
not O
reach O
an O
agreement O
with O
Israel B-ORG
, O
the O
Lebanese O
situation O
will O
remain O
insecure O
and O
unpredictable O
. O

The O
only O
hope O
for O
the O

situation O
to O

is O
to O
achieve O
a O
comprehensive O

in O

The O
Government B-ORG
is O
studying O
the O
possibility O
that O
agricultural O
cooperatives O
distribute O
fuel O
, O
an O
initiative O
that O
could O
be O
implemented O
within O
the O
package O
of O
liberalization O
measures O
in O
different O
economic O
sectors O
, O
which O
will O
be O
announced O
in O
June O
, O
including O
energy O
. O

This O
was O
indicated O
today O
by O
the O
undersecretary O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Agriculture I-ORG
, O
Manuel B-PER
Lamela I-PER
, O
who O
clarified O
that O
this O
measure O
is O
not O
specified O
, O
" O
but O
could O
be O
assessed O
within O
the O
liberalization O
package O
. O

The O
distribution O
of O
fuels O
is O
an O
old O
claim O
of O
agricultural O
cooperatives O
, O
which O
on O
many O
occasions O
have O
demanded O
to O
supply O
their O
members O
not O
only O
agricultural O
diesel O
, O
but O
also O
other O
fuels O
, O
since O
1998 O
, O
a O
change O
in O
the O
regulations O
in O
this O
area O
prevented O
this O
practice O
. O

Lamela B-PER
made O
these O
statements O
hours O
after O
the O
main O
operators O
of O
gasoline O
and O
diesel O
in O
the O
country O
( O
Cepsa B-ORG
and O
Repsol B-ORG
) O
announced O
a O
new O
price O
increase O
. O

Also O
, O
Lamela B-PER
said O
that O
tomorrow O
, O
day O
24 O
, O
in O
the O
plenary O
session O
of O
the O
Congress B-ORG
of I-ORG
Deputies I-ORG
, O
the O
Minister O
of O
Agriculture B-MISC
, O
Miguel B-PER
Arias I-PER
Cañete I-PER
, O
could O
specify O
in O
a O
more O
concrete O
way O
the O
possible O
ways O
to O
alleviate O
the O
rise O
of O
fuels O
in O
the O
primary O
sector O
. O

He O
added O
that O
Agriculture B-MISC
maintains O
conversations O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
ministries O
involved O
- O
Economy B-MISC
, O
Treasury B-MISC
and O
Development B-MISC
- O
to O
look O
for O
solutions O
to O
alleviate O
this O
problem O
and O
thus O
he O
affirmed O
that O
" O
today O
there O
is O
the O
challenge O
of O
the O
real O
liberalization O
of O
the O
hydrocarbon O
sector O
" O
. O

On O
the O
possibility O
of O
lowering O
fuel O
taxes O
, O
he O
recalled O
that O
the O
taxation O
of O
diesel O
B O
or O
agricultural O
is O
" O
very O
low O
, O
so O
the O
margin O
of O
decrease O
is O
practically O
nonexistent O
" O
and O
bet O
on O
finding O
ways O
to O
alleviate O
the O
situation O
without O
distorting O
the O
economy O
. O

The O
agrarian O
and O
cooperative O
organizations O
insisted O
, O
in O
declarations O
to O
EFE B-ORG
, O
in O
the O
negative O
repercussion O
that O
supposes O
the O
increase O
of O
the O
price O
of O
the O
fuels O
for O
the O
sector O
, O
which O
has O
caused O
an O
increase O
of O
costs O
superior O
to O
50,000 O
million O
pesetas O
. O

the O

the O

to O
liberalize O
the O

it O

beneficial O
" O
for O
the O

CCAE B-ORG
urges O
the O

to O
abolish O
the O
regulation O
approved O
in O
1998 O
that O
prevented O
these O
entities O
from O
supplying O
fuel O
to O
their O
members O
, O
because O
it O
was O
" O
a O
limit O
to O
the O

which O
until O

could O
freely O

CEOE B-ORG
held O
today O
in O
Madrid B-LOC

The O
president O
of O
the O
employers O
described O
as O
" O
inexplicable O
" O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
Government B-ORG
, O
since O
, O
he O
said O
, O
the O
oil O

what O
they O
are O
doing O

" O
transferring O
the O

" O
. O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
complex O
problem O
whose O
solution O
involves O
the O
analysis O
of O
several O
factors O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
said O
Cuevas B-PER
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
analyze O
the O
conduct O
of O
the O
oil O
companies O
" O
in O
case O
they O
incur O
in O
some O
defect O
or O
infraction O
of O
the O
competition O
" O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he O
said O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
study O
the O
rise O
in O
crude O
oil O
prices O
in O
the O
main O
producing O
countries O
, O
and O
, O
thirdly O
, O
" O
it O
is O
necessary O
" O
to O
analyze O
the O
role O
played O
by O

product O
" O
so O
important O

of O
prices O
, O
the O
flexibility O
of O
the O

and O
the O
competitiveness O
of O
the O
companies O
" O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
said O
Cuevas B-PER
, O
" O
taxation O
is O
not O
something O
absolute O
and O
must O
work O
according O
to O
each O
stage O
" O
. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
employers O
advocated O
" O
not O
to O
make O
judgments O
a O

" O
of O
the O
simultaneous O

that O
the O

an O
allocation O
of O
100 O
million O
pesetas O
will O
be O
made O
available O
for O
this O
year O
so O
that O
" O
those O
citizens O
who O
have O
a O
recognized O
benefit O
, O
whatever O
it O
is O
called O
, O
will O
have O
a O
supplement O
and O
can O
reach O
a O
minimum O
of O
685,000 O
pesetas O
a O
year O
" O
. O

Prieto B-PER
considered O
that O
" O
we O
exceed O
by O
far O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
other O
territories O
, O
and O
quite O
a O
few O
groups O
are O
improved O
" O
, O
while O
the O
deputy O
general O
said O
to O
have O
accepted O
such O
a O
measure O
" O
with O
satisfaction O
" O
. O

Another O
of O
the O
issues O
agreed O
between O
the O
two O
parties O
is O
the O
implementation O
of O
a O
social O
toll O
on O
the O
A-68 B-MISC
highway O
from O
Altube B-LOC
to O
Areta B-LOC
for O
the O
citizens O
of O
Alava O
. O

Although O
both O
Prieto B-PER
and O
Rabanera B-PER
assured O
that O
they O
are O
still O
in O
talks O
with O
the O
concessionaire O
, O
Autopista B-MISC
Vasco I-MISC
- O
Aragonesa O
, O
the O
Provincial B-ORG
Council O
will O
enable O
an O
item O
of O
thirty O
million O
, O
which O
could O
be O
extended O
, O
so O
that O
residents O
in O
the O
valley B-LOC
of I-LOC
Ayala I-LOC
have O
free O
highway O
up O
to O
a O
maximum O
of O
20 O
trips O
per O
month O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
Alava O
, O
the O
implementation O
of O
a O
soft O
toll O
is O
being O
negotiated O
for O
the O
same O
number O
of O
trips O
per O
month O
, O
and O
on O
which O
a O
reduction O
of O
fifty O
percent O
could O
be O
applied O
. O

Likewise O
, O
Juan B-PER
Carlos I-PER
Prieto I-PER
highlighted O
the O
increase O
introduced O
in O
the O
Department O
of O
Social B-MISC
Welfare O
, O
which O
" O
will O
increase O
more O
than O
twelve O
percent O
" O
over O
the O
previous O
year O

budget O
, O
a O
400 O
million O
item O
will O
be O
included O
for O
the O
reform O
of O
the O
Mendizorroza B-LOC
soccer O

, O
and O
25 O
million O
more O
for O
the O

Prieto B-PER
specified O
that O
in O

" O
the O

represented O
with O
its O

As O
reported O
by O
the O

José B-PER
Benedicto I-PER
, O
if O
the O
complaint O
is O
successful O
, O
the O

will O
appear O

action O
for O

that O
the O
employer O
Pedro B-PER
Canals I-PER
Palou I-PER
, O
" O

been O
acting O
criminally O
since O
November O

For O
his O
part O
, O
in O
statements O
to O
Efe B-ORG

the O
employer O
denied O
the O
facts O
and O
said O
that O
the O
workers O
" O
some O
of O
whom O
I O
hired O
as O
officers O
and O
then O
turned O
out O
to O

breached O
the O

showed O
up O
for O

when O
they O

Pedro B-PER

who O

stressed O
that O
" O

which O

the O

after O

confirmed O
that O
they O
were O
90 O

This O

that O
some O

That O

it O

it O

more O
than O
4 O

that O

could O
not O
take O

the O

that O
was O
to O

them O
was O
stranded O

According O
to O
the O

possibly O
the O

when O
the O

the O

the O

Bancroft B-PER

that O
" O
blood O

is O
crucial O

that O
" O

help O
a O

, O
after O
which O
it O
was O
determined O
that O
Viagra B-MISC
benefited O
those O
who O
had O
sexual O
problems O
after O
a O
hysterectomy O
. O

Faced O
with O
the O
Pfizer B-ORG
study O
, O
Berman B-PER
said O
that O
" O
before O
we O
draw O
the O
conclusion O
that O
( O
Viagra B-MISC
) O
does O
not O
work O
, O
we O
need O
to O
limit O
our O

to O

can O
help O
, O
those O
who O
have O
adequate O
hormones O
and O
still O
have O
trouble O
feeling O
sexual O

" O
. O

In O
Berman B-PER
's O
study O
, O
all O
the O
women O
who O
had O
to O
have O
their O
uterus O
removed O
complained O
of O
decreased O
sensations O
during O
intercourse O
, O
but O
after O
taking O
Viagra B-MISC
, O
only O
22 O
percent O
had O
the O
same O
complaints O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
study O
, O
the O
35 O
indicated O
that O
they O
had O
lost O
their O
ability O
to O
reach O
orgasm O
, O
but O
after O
ingesting O
the O
drug O
, O
only O
16 O
percent O
showed O
the O
same O
inability O
, O
said O
Berman B-PER
. O

The O
percentage O
of O
women O
who O
felt O
pain O
, O
discomfort O
or O
discomfort O
during O

dropped O
from O
68 O
percent O
to O
33 O

after O

. O

Anyway O
, O
Berman B-PER
believes O
that O
perhaps O
women O
worry O
too O
much O
about O
sex O
. O

" O
There O
is O
a O

the O

that O

similar O
to O
that O
of O
Expo B-MISC
' I-MISC
92 I-MISC
, O
according O
to O
the O
mayor O
. O

The O
Seville B-LOC
Olympic O
project O
is O
" O
realistic O
" O
because O
of O
the O
forty O
facilities O
needed O
there O
are O
already O
thirty O
, O
three O
more O
are O
planned O
even O
if O
the O
city O
does O
not O
organize O
the O

and O
seven O

be O
the O
only O

These O
data O
are O
contained O
in O
the O
questionnaire O
of O

answer O
at O
the O

June O
for O
the O
first O
choice O
of O

in O
August O
. O

The O
mayor O
was O
convinced O
that O
the O
IOC B-ORG
will O
value O
the O
concentration O
of O
facilities O
because O
it O
lowers O
costs O
, O
as O
well O
as O
public O
transport O
infrastructure O
already O
existing O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Monteseirín B-PER
also O
stressed O
that O

the O
IOC B-ORG

on O
municipal O
land O
, O
where O
the O

doing O
the O
work O
will O
have O
the O
obligation O
to O

in O
the O

of O
the O
surrounding O
area O
to O
" O

it O
" O
, O
said O

assured O
that O
these O
urban O
development O
actions O
have O
social O
, O
urban O
and O
environmental O
objectives O
, O
and O
said O
that O
they O
will O
be O
made O
even O
if O

He O
said O
that O

" O
that O

a O
very O
positive O

The O

that O
the O
city O
will O
need O
or O
the O

only O
noted O
that O

that O

that O

. O

For O
Moreno B-PER
, O
the O
main O
reasons O
that O
have O
influenced O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
waiting O
list O
( O
which O
has O
gone O
from O
142,000 O
in O
December O
to O
151,421 O
in O
March O
2000 O
) O
are O
the O
increase O
in O
surgical O
activity O
, O
which O
brings O
with O
it O
greater O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
coincidence O
with O
other O
conjunctural O
events O
, O
such O
as O
vacation O
periods O
. O

" O
I O
can O
not O
say O
that O
I O
am O
satisfied O
with O
61 O
days O
of O
average O
delay O
, O
nor O
with O
any O
day O
of O
delay O
, O
" O
said O
Moreno B-PER
, O
who O
nevertheless O
pointed O
out O
that O
hospitals O
need O
to O
have O
a O
certain O
period O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
schedule O
surgical O
interventions O
. O

He O
also O
indicated O
that O
much O
of O
the O
decrease O
in O
waiting O
lists O
that O
has O
occurred O
in O
recent O
years O
is O
due O
to O
the O
efforts O
of O
hospitals O
with O
the O
increase O
in O
surgical O
activity O
in O
the O
period O
January O
- O
April O
grew O
by O
5.7 O
percent O
, O
representing O
11,400 O
more O
interventions O
than O
in O
the O
same O
period O
in O
1999 O
. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
he O
noted O
that O
in O
the O
period O
January O
- O
April O
were O
intervened O
4,619 O
patients O
in O
afternoon O
activity O
, O
of O
which O
1,151 O
were O
operated O
in O
April O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
president O
of O
Insalud B-ORG
expressed O
his O
desire O
that O
patients O
on O
the O
waiting O
list O
who O
have O
been O
waiting O
more O
than O
90 O
days O
can O
choose O
the O

in O
which O
they O
want O
to O
be O
operated O

that O
they O
are O

presided O
over O
by O
the O
PNV B-ORG

Since O
the O

it O

out O

some O

are O
true O
, O
the O
big O
responsible O
for O
all O
this O

the O
PNV B-ORG

reiterated O
that O
the O

" O
is O
responsible O
, O
among O

, O
because O
it O
has O
not O
let O

that O
they O
could O
learn O

Rabanera B-PER
said O
that O
" O
it O
does O
not O
surprise O
me O
at O
all O
that O
the O
PNV B-ORG

that O

Finally O

Adega B-ORG
points O
out O
that O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
results O
of O
the O
forest O
inventory O
to O
know O
the O
" O
enormous O
proliferation O
" O
of O
eucalyptus O
plantations O
, O
which O
Galician O
ecologists O
have O
been O
denouncing O
for O
years O
, O
and O
recall O
that O
they O
presented O
in O
Parliament B-ORG
in O
88 O
a O
forestry O
legislative O
initiative O
that O
was O
rejected O
. O

Regardless O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
considers O
" O
one O
more O
measure O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
" O
this O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
subsidy O
to O
the O
eucalyptus O
, O
Adega B-ORG
says O
it O
is O
" O
totally O
insufficient O
and O
clearly O
unfocused O
objectives O
" O
. O

This O
association O
says O
that O
the O
increase O
in O
eucalyptus O
plantations O
respond O
to O
more O
motivations O
than O
aid O
, O
such O
as O
the O
" O
enormous O
pressure O
from O
pulp O
mills O
" O
, O
or O
the O
" O
forced O
abandonment O
" O
and O
also O
subsidized O
" O
of O
farms O
, O
which O
end O
up O
dedicating O
the O
land O
to O
this O
species O
. O

" O
Well O
knows O
the O
Consellería B-ORG
, O
says O
Adega B-ORG
, O
the O
regression O
of O
our O
masses O
of O

vegetation O
against O
the O
proliferation O
of O
fast O
- O
growing O
species O
, O
mainly O
eucalyptus O

" O
. O

Therefore O
, O
says O
that O
the O
native O
hardwoods O
are O
those O
that O
require O

, O
both O
for O
plantations O
and O
for O

Guirao B-PER
said O
that O
the O
importance O

lies O

that O
it O

with O
his O
concern O
for O
the O

the O
second O
is O

" O
very O
difficult O
to O

on O

at O

" O
. O

The O
hitherto O

at O

when O
at O

request O

took O
stock O

He O
stressed O
that O
in O
the O
nearly O
six O
years O
he O
has O
been O
at O
the O
helm O
of O
the O
center O
has O
been O
fortunate O
to O
have O
always O
had O
" O
the O
support O

the O
ministry O

above O
all O
, O
a O
team O
of O
professionals O
who O
have O
been O
at O
the O
height O
of O
a O
museum O
in O
constant O
evolution O
" O
. O

This O
has O
allowed O
him O
to O
move O
forward O
a O
project O
that O
began O
with O
his O
appointment O
by O
the O
Socialist O
Minister O
of O
Culture B-MISC
Carmen B-PER
Alborch I-PER
and O
was O
not O
interrupted O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
PP B-ORG
to O
power O
and O
the O
successive O
appointments O
of O
Esperanza B-PER
Aguirre I-PER

Mariano B-PER
Rajoy I-PER
as O
ministers O
of O
Education B-MISC

His O
harmony O
was O
special O
with O
the O
former O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
for O
Culture B-MISC
, O
Miguel B-PER
Angel I-PER
Cortes I-PER
, O
who O
always O
supported O
the O
initiatives O
of O
the O
museum O
, O
although O
Guirao B-PER
felt O
that O
" O
more O
than O
personal O
relationships O
, O
the O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
have O
projects O
" O
. O

The O
hitherto O
director O
of O
the O
Reina B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
insisted O
that O
at O
no O
time O
has O
had O
pressure O
from O
the O
administration O
and O
has O
received O
support O
that O
resulted O
in O
an O
increase O
in O
economic O
means O
. O

He O
recalled O
that O
for O
this O
year O
the O
regular O
budget O
of O
the O
museum O
went O
from O
400 O
million O
. O
1,500 O
million O
and O
in O
recent O
years O
the O
Reina B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
has O
had O
many O
economic O
resources O
, O
both O
by O
way O
of O
budget O
and O
by O
way O
of O
donations O
( O
tax O
payments O
) O
, O
to O
buy O
quality O
works O
. O

This O
has O
allowed O
him O
to O
complete O
gaps O
in O
the O
collection O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
works O
by O
Juan B-PER
Gris I-PER
, O
Miró B-PER
and O
Picasso B-PER
and O
initiate O
the O
project O
to O
expand O
the O
facilities O
. O

Guirao B-PER
was O
confident O
that O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
new O
team O
to O
the O
museum O
there O
will O
be O
continuity O
in O
the O
recovery O
of O
significant O
Spanish O
artists O
, O
although O
he O
considered O
that O
this O
is O
an O
approach O
that O
corresponds O
to O
his O
successor O
. O

The O
director O

" O
The O

the O
most O
anti O

, O
would O
be O
for O
Spain B-ORG

" O
said O
the O
Catalan O

quoting O

writer O
. O

According O
to O
Pujol B-PER
, O
" O
we O
would O
have O
to O
put O
an O
end O

the O

so O

called O

parties O

wield O

opposing O

they O

" O
. O

Moreover O
, O
he O
considered O
that O
" O
a O
vigorous O

the O
Maghreb B-LOC

only O
favor O
European O
economic O
expansion O
in O

As O
for O
the O
benefits O
of O

for O
Western O
European O
societies O
with O
low O
birth O
rates O
, O
he O
said O
that O
" O
they O
are O
indisputable O
" O
because O
they O
contribute O
to O
" O
increase O
the O
working O
population O
and O
thus O
facilitate O
the O

" O
. O

However O
, O
he O
warned O
that O
these O
positive O

because O
of O
the O

He O
also O
warned O

" O
one O
of O

The O
Government B-ORG
is O
studying O
the O
possibility O
that O
agricultural O
cooperatives O
distribute O
fuel O
, O
an O
initiative O
that O
could O
be O
implemented O
within O
the O
package O
of O

measures O
in O
different O
economic O
sectors O
, O
which O
will O
be O
announced O
in O
June O
, O
including O
energy O
. O

This O
was O
indicated O
today O
by O
the O
undersecretary O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Agriculture I-ORG
, O
Manuel B-PER
Lamela I-PER
, O
who O
clarified O
that O
this O
measure O
is O
not O
specified O
, O
" O
but O
could O
be O
assessed O
within O
the O
liberalization O
package O
. O

The O
distribution O
of O
fuels O
is O
an O
old O
claim O
of O
agricultural O
cooperatives O
, O
which O
on O
many O
occasions O
have O
demanded O
to O
supply O
their O
members O
not O
only O
agricultural O
diesel O
, O
but O
also O
other O
fuels O
, O
since O
1998 O
, O
a O
change O
in O
the O
regulations O
in O
this O
area O
prevented O
this O
practice O
. O

Lamela B-PER
made O
these O
statements O
hours O
after O
the O
main O
operators O
of O
gasoline O
and O
diesel O
in O
the O
country O
, O
Cepsa B-ORG
and O
Repsol B-ORG
, O
announced O
a O
new O
price O

. O

Also O
, O
Lamela B-PER
said O
that O
tomorrow O
, O
day O

, O
in O

of O
the O
Congress B-ORG
of I-ORG

, O
the O
Minister O
of O
Agriculture B-MISC
, O
Miguel B-PER
Arias I-PER
Cañete I-PER
, O
could O
specify O
in O
a O
more O
concrete O
way O
the O
possible O
ways O
to O
alleviate O
the O
rise O
in O
fuel O
prices O
in O
the O
primary O
sector O
. O

He O
added O
that O
Agriculture B-MISC
maintains O
conversations O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
ministries O
involved O
, O
those O
of O
Economy B-MISC

Works I-MISC
, O
for O
the O
search O
of O
solutions O
to O
alleviate O
this O
problem O
and O
thus O
he O
affirmed O
that O
" O
today O
there O
is O
the O
challenge O
of O
the O
real O
liberalization O
of O
the O
hydrocarbon O
sector O
" O
. O

On O
the O
possibility O
of O
lowering O
fuel O
taxes O
, O
he O
recalled O
that O
the O
taxation O
of O
diesel O
B O
or O
agricultural O
is O
" O
very O
low O
, O
so O
the O
margin O
of O
decrease O
is O
practically O
nonexistent O
" O
and O
bet O
on O
finding O
ways O
to O
alleviate O
the O
situation O
without O
distorting O
the O
economy O
. O

The O
agrarian O
and O
cooperative O
organizations O
insisted O
, O
in O
declarations O
to O
Efe B-ORG
, O
in O
the O
negative O
repercussion O
that O
has O
supposed O
the O
increase O
of O
the O
price O
of O
the O
fuels O
for O
this O
economic O
sector O
, O
which O
has O
caused O
an O
increase O
of O
costs O
superior O

CCAE B-ORG
urges O
the O

to O
abolish O
the O

approved O
in O
1998 O
, O
which O
prevented O
these O
entities O
from O
supplying O

to O
their O
members O
, O
because O
it O
meant O
" O
a O
limit O

until O

The O
alleged O
aggression O
occurred O
on O
May O
25 O
, O
1999 O
, O
when O
the O
young O
woman O
- O
who O
had O
a O
knee O
injury O
- O
went O
to O
receive O
massages O
at O
the O
clinic O
of O
an O
employer O
's O
mutual O
insurance O
company O
for O
work O
accidents O
, O
but O
according O
to O
her O
complaint O
already O
in O
the O
five O
previous O
sessions O
the O
physiotherapist O
made O
libidinous O
touching O
. O

On O
those O
occasions O
, O
the O
complainant O
said O
at O
the O
trial O
, O
she O
expressed O
her O
discomfort O
to O
the O
physiotherapist O
and O
told O
him O
on O
several O
occasions O
: O
" O
Stop O
it O
, O
leave O
me O
alone O
" O
. O

However O
, O
during O
the O
trial O
the O
defendant O
denied O
the O
facts O
, O
argued O
that O
such O
massages O
are O
given O
with O
a O
bathing O
suit O
on O
and O
with O
the O
patient O
covering O
his O
genitals O
with O
his O
own O
hands O
and O
said O
that O
the O
massage O
booths O
of O
the O
clinic O
are O
formed O
by O
a O
dividing O
panels O
open O
at O
the O
top O
, O
with O
a O
sliding O
door O
that O
can O
open O
anyone O
, O
which O
do O
not O
allow O
privacy O
and O
you O
can O
hear O
what O
happens O
inside O
. O

The O
prosecutor O
asked O
for O
the O
defendant O
24 O
months O
in O
prison O
and O
the O
payment O
of O
compensation O
of O
half O
a O
million O
pesetas O
to O
the O
victim O
, O
a O
penalty O
that O
the O
private O
prosecution O
raised O
to O
three O
years O
in O
prison O
and O
5 O
million O
pesetas O
in O
compensation O
. O

In O
his O
report O
, O
the O
prosecutor O
acknowledged O
the O
difficulty O
of O
judging O
this O
type O
of O
crime O
that O
takes O
place O
without O
witnesses O
and O
in O
which O
" O
it O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
believing O
or O
not O
" O
each O
statement O
, O
but O
added O
that O
the O
version O
of O
the O
complainant O
seemed O
to O
him O
" O
coherent O
" O
. O

For O
his O
part O
, O
the O
defense O
lawyer O
said O
that O
the O
development O
of O
the O
trial O
" O
has O
not O
demonstrated O
either O
the O
objective O
fact O
of O
the O
touching O
or O
the O
concupiscent O
or O
libidinous O
will O
" O
of O
the O
defendant O
, O
and O
said O
that O
the O
testimonies O
of O
the O
young O

from O

, O
which O

Guirao B-PER
said O
that O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
first O
lies O
in O
that O
it O
links O
the O
theme O
that O
interested O
Picasso B-PER
in O
the O
30s O
with O
his O
concern O
for O
the O
work O
of O
Goya B-PER
, O
while O
the O
second O
is O
a O
work O
of O
early O
cubism O
" O
very O
difficult O
to O
find O
on O
the O
market O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
" O
. O

The O
hitherto O
director O
of O
the O
Reina B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
unveiled O
this O
initiative O
after O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
exhibition O
of O
Jiri B-PER
Georg I-PER
Dokoupil I-PER
at O
the O
Palacio B-LOC
de I-LOC
Velázquez I-LOC
del O
Retiro B-LOC
when O
, O
at O
the O
request O
of O
reporters O
, O
took O
stock O
of O
his O
management O
. O

He O
stressed O
that O
in O
the O
nearly O
six O
years O
he O
has O
been O
at O
the O
helm O
of O
the O
center O
has O
been O
fortunate O
to O
have O
always O
had O
" O
the O
support O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
, O
the O
Board B-ORG
of I-ORG
Trustees I-ORG
and O
above O
all O
, O
a O
team O
of O
professionals O
who O
have O
been O
at O
the O
height O
of O
a O
museum O
in O
constant O
evolution O
" O
. O

This O
has O
allowed O
him O
to O
move O
forward O
a O
project O
that O
began O
with O
his O
appointment O
by O
the O
Socialist O
Minister O
of O
Culture B-MISC
Carmen B-PER
Alborch I-PER
and O
was O
not O
interrupted O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
PP B-ORG
to O
power O
and O
the O
successive O
appointments O
of O
Esperanza B-PER
Aguirre I-PER
and O
Mariano B-PER
Rajoy I-PER
as O
Ministers O
of O
Education B-MISC
. I-MISC
Culture I-MISC
. O

His O
harmony O
was O
special O
with O
the O
former O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
for O
Culture B-MISC
, O
Miguel B-PER
Angel I-PER
Cortes I-PER
, O
who O
always O
supported O
the O
initiatives O
of O
the O
museum O
, O
although O
Guirao B-PER
felt O
that O
" O
more O
than O
personal O
relationships O
, O
the O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
have O
projects O
" O
. O

The O
hitherto O
director O
of O
the O
Reina B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
insisted O
that O
at O
no O
time O
has O
had O
pressure O
from O
the O
Administration B-ORG
and O
has O
received O
support O
that O
resulted O
in O
an O
increase O
in O
financial O
resources O
. O

He O
recalled O
that O
for O
this O
year O
the O
regular O
budget O
of O
the O
museum O
went O
from O
400 O
million O
. O
1,500 O
million O
and O
in O
recent O
years O
the O
Reina B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
has O
had O
many O
economic O
resources O
, O
both O
by O
way O
of O
budget O
and O
by O
way O
of O
endowments O
( O
tax O
payments O
) O
, O
to O
buy O
quality O
works O
. O

This O
has O
allowed O
him O
to O
complete O
gaps O
in O
the O
collection O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
works O
by O
Juan B-PER
Gris I-PER
, O
Miró B-PER
and O
Picasso B-PER
and O
initiate O
the O
project O
to O
expand O
the O
facilities O
. O

Guirao B-PER
was O
confident O
that O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
new O
team O
to O
the O
museum O
there O
will O
be O
continuity O
in O
the O
recovery O
of O
significant O
Spanish O
artists O
, O
although O
he O
considered O
that O
this O
is O
an O
approach O
that O
corresponds O
to O
his O
successor O
. O

The O
director O
of O
the O
Reina B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
, O
who O
considers O
himself O
fortunate O
to O
have O
been O
able O
to O
develop O
his O
project O
and O
does O
not O
feel O
frustrated O
by O
his O
dismissal O
, O
explained O
that O
the O
key O
to O
his O
management O
has O
been O
" O
work O
and O
let O
his O
team O
work O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
one O
of O
the O
challenges O
now O
facing O
the O
Reina B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
is O
the O
increase O
in O
human O
resources O
, O
" O
very O
necessary O
because O
the O
museum O
works O
thanks O
to O
the O
work O
and O
generosity O
of O
the O
people O
" O
. O

As O
for O
the O
most O
complicated O
moments O
experienced O
during O
his O
management O
, O
he O
said O
that O
the O
first O
was O
his O
arrival O
at O
the O
center O
, O
with O
the O
resignation O
of O
several O
members O
of O
the O
board O
and O
the O
other O
occurred O
with O
the O
controversy O
raised O
by O
the O
request O
for O
the O
loan O
of O
Guernica B-MISC
, O
resolved O
" O
with O
a O
professional O
behavior O

The O

Pedro B-PER
Solbes I-PER
, O
advised O
today O
, O
Tuesday O
, O
EU B-ORG
governments O
to O
accelerate O
the O
cut O
in O
their O
public O
deficit O
and O
bring O
forward O
to O
2002 O
the O
goal O
of O
balanced O
budget O
. O

At O
the O
presentation O
of O
a O
report O
on O
public O
finances O
in O
the O
EU B-ORG
, O
Solbes B-PER
insisted O
that O
if O
governments O
reach O
balance O
by O
2002 O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
year O
later O
as O
most O
expect O
, O
will O
increase O
by O
several O
points O
the O
margin O
needed O
to O
make O
tax O
cuts O
to O
stimulate O
growth O
and O
create O
jobs O
. O

This O
margin O
will O
also O
serve O
to O
alleviate O
the O
burden O
that O
budgets O
will O
have O
to O
bear O
due O
to O
the O
aging O
of O
the O
population O
, O
Solbes B-PER
said O
. O

" O
The O
more O
the O
deficit O
is O
reduced O
now O
, O
the O
more O
room O
there O
will O
be O
" O
to O
bear O
that O
burden O
, O
although O
for O
almost O
all O

" O
will O
not O
be O
enough O
" O

" O
we O
will O
also O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
reform O
of O
social O

models O
" O
, O
he O
said O
. O

The O
European O
Commissioner O
stressed O
that O
the O
upturn O
in O
economic O
growth O
in O
the O
last O
two O
years O
should O
serve O
to O
accelerate O
the O
reduction O
of O
the O
deficit O
, O
the O
pace O
of O
which O
has O
slowed O
in O
the O
last O
two O
years O
. O

Solbes B-PER
explained O
that O
accelerating O
fiscal O
consolidation O
is O
even O
" O
more O
unavoidable O
" O
at O
a O
time O
like O
the O
present O
, O
characterized O
by O
" O
strong O
activity O
in O
the O
private O
sector O
" O
. O

If O
European O
governments O
do O
not O
reduce O
the O
budget O
deficit O
at O
this O
time O
and O
through O
public O
spending O
or O
tax O
cuts O
further O
stimulate O
demand O
, O
" O
all O
they O
get O
is O
to O
add O
fuel O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
increase O
inflation O
and O
cut O
the O
growth O
period O
, O
" O
Solbes B-PER
explained O
. O

" O
This O
is O
exactly O
what O
we O
have O
done O
other O
times O
and O
exactly O
the O
opposite O
of O
what O

did O
" O
in O
the O
nineties O
, O
he O
added O

Solbes B-PER
stressed O
that O
while O
the O
priority O
should O
be O
to O
end O
the O
public O
deficit O
, O
tax O
cuts O
or O
restructuring O
of O
public O
spending O
can O
always O
be O
carried O
out O
in O

. O

cuts O
should O
, O
in O

opinion O

be O
aimed O
at O

The O
intention O
of O
the O

as O
explained O
by O

" O
Naturally O
, O
" O
continued O
Tur B-PER
, O
this O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
the O
Government B-MISC

to O
raise O

in O

that O

against O

Yesterday O
, O
the O

, O
where O
the O
attacker O
was O
a O
half O

to O

asking O

a O
negotiation O
to O
redefine O
the O

, O
on O

hand O
, O
to O
urge O
the O

to O
implement O
all O
the O
jurisdictional O
actions O
that O
may O
be O
appropriate O
if O
the O
case O
arises O
. O

Valledor B-PER
made O
reference O
to O
the O
case O
that O
the O
Principality B-ORG
will O
present O
an O
appeal O
of O
powers O
against O
the O
State B-ORG
Government I-ORG
if O
it O
does O
not O
open O
a O
path O
of O
negotiations O
. O

The O
initiative O
is O
based O
on O
the O
lack O
of O
dialogue O
and O
refusal O
of O
the O
central O
government B-ORG
to O
make O
variations O
on O
the O
route O
, O
so O
he O
considers O
that O
it O
is O
important O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
Principality B-ORG
to O
maintain O
its O
firm O
position O
already O
stated O
last O
October O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

The O
other O
proposal O
revolves O
around O
the O
agricultural O
field O
, O
as O
this O
political O
formation O
is O
interested O
in O
knowing O
first O
hand O
the O
Rural B-MISC
Development I-MISC
Plan I-MISC
, O
and O
accuse O
the O
Executive B-ORG
of O

Alvarez I-PER

of O
not O
informing O

it O
. O

For O
IU B-ORG
, O
the O

" O

absolutely O
unknown O
" O
and O
point O
out O
that O
in O

not O
given O

information O
and O

not O

" O
It O

the O

the O
fact O

the O

perhaps O
not O
the O

" O
The O

is O

The O
author O
assures O
that O
she O
has O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
when O
a O
critic O
says O
that O
" O
something O
is O
feminine O
, O
it O
means O
that O
it O
is O

always O
made O
and O
, O
what O
's O
more O
, O
when O

talks O
about O

it O

a O

with O

taste O

To O
support O
his O
theory O
, O
Freixas B-PER
provides O
an O
example O
of O
a O
literary O
review O
in O
which O
a O
commentator O
of O
a O

stated O
, O
referring O
to O
a O
winner O
of O

that O

' O
it O
is O
a O
book O
that O
addresses O
itself O
directly O
to O
the O
feminine O
heart O
, O
to O
that O
corny O
, O
tender O
heart O
that O
all O

carry O
inside O

" O
It O
means O
, O
emphasizes O
Freixas B-PER
, O
that O
when O
a O
person O
likes O
bad O
literature O
, O
is O
that O
she O
is O
a O

, O
that O
is O
, O
that O
the O
feminine O
is O

rate O
and O
the O
masculine O
first O
" O
. O

According O
to O
the O
writer O
, O
this O
is O
a O
theory O
that O
is O
deeply O
rooted O
in O
Spanish O
society O
, O
which O
does O
not O
realize O
that O
most O
of O
the O
students O
of O

the O

" O
the O
use O
that O

have O
the O

At O
a O
time O
, O
the O
one O
that O
goes O
until O
the O
40s O
, O
when O
there O
was O
no O
mass O
culture O
were O
the O

, O
influenced O
by O

, O
in O
charge O
of O
reflecting O
that O
sentimental O
memory O

" O
It O
is O
a O
closed O
and O
finished O
era O
" O
, O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
author O
who O
recalled O
that O
songs O
like O
" O
My B-MISC

" O
were O
heard O
during O
the O
civil O
war O
on O
both O
sides O

that O
had O
been O
born O
twenty O
years O
earlier O

Today O

songs O

with O
few O
exceptions O
, O
last O
two O
months O
" O

The O
youngest O
and O
the O
readers O
of O
the O
XXI O
century O
will O
be O
able O
, O
through O
this O
songbook O
, O
remember O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Spanish O
popular O
culture O
in O
the O
preformation O
phase O
of O
the O
cultural O
industry O
market O
. O

Although O
at O
present O
the O
copla O
is O
still O
interpreted O
" O
to O
the O
tonadillera O
is O
not O
supplied O
with O
songs O
that O
last O
. O

They O
interpret O
inherited O
compositions O
in O
a O
repertoire O
tailored O
to O
their O
needs O
. O

The O
copla O
is O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
has O
not O
rebounded O
because O
it O
has O
been O
closed O
by O
the O
great O
cultural O
industry O
of O
the O
record O
that O
has O
not O
let O
it O
prosper O
. O

If O
in O
previous O
years O
the O
songs O
responded O
to O
a O
culture O
that O
was O
directed O
by O
politics O
, O
at O
present O
the O
market O
is O
the O
one O
that O
directs O
that O
culture O
, O
" O
now O
we O
are O
to O
regime O
of O
monoculture O
in O

The O
European O

stressed O
that O
the O
upturn O
in O
economic O

in O
the O

serve O
to O
accelerate O
the O

the O
pace O

which O
has O
slowed O
in O
the O

Solbes B-PER
explained O
that O
accelerating O

is O
even O
" O

" O
at O

the O
present O
, O
characterized O
by O
" O
strong O
activity O
in O

" O
. O

If O
European O

do O
not O
reduce O
the O
budget O
deficit O
at O
this O
time O
and O
through O
public O
spending O
or O
tax O
cuts O
further O
stimulate O
demand O
, O
" O
all O
they O
get O
is O
to O

, O
increase O

cut O
the O

, O
" O
Solbes B-PER

" O
This O
is O
exactly O
what O
we O

be O
to O
end O
the O

, O
tax O

or O
restructuring O
of O
public O

can O
always O
be O
carried O
out O
in O

should O
, O
in O

opinion O

be O
aimed O
at O
reducing O
non O

" O

" O
the O
greatest O
possible O

also O
expressed O
his O
intention O
to O
negotiate O
the O

in O
the O
RTVE B-ORG

the O
Central B-ORG

before O

Mariano B-PER
Rajoy I-PER

he O

which O
he O
noted O
should O
apply O
in O
all O

. O

" O
Logic O
, O
wisdom O
and O
common O
sense O
says O
that O
we O
agree O
on O
some O

but O
that O

are O
the O

for O

, O
" O
said O
Rajoy B-PER

who O
also O
considered O
the O

acknowledged O
that O

finds O
it O
" O
very O
difficult O

to O
regulate O
these O

He O
assured O
that O
he O
does O
not O
share O
the O
idea O
put O
forward O
by O
the O
PNV B-ORG
spokesman O
that O
all O

should O
be O
those O
who O
must O
go O
through O

, O
although O

does O
not O

out O
" O
that O

the O

such O

Rajoy B-PER
asked O
for O
the O
support O
of O
all O

agree O
on O

that O
- O
he O
said O
- O
" O
neither O
give O
nor O
take O
away O
votes O
" O
, O
but O
that O
a O
lack O
of O

" O
does O
not O
contribute O
to O
the O
credit O
of O
the O
political O
forces O
, O
" O
he O
said O
after O
recalling O
that O
the O

not O
been O
renewed O
since O
1998 O
for O

who O
recalled O
the O

the O

Sanz B-PER
said O
in O
Brussels B-LOC
, O
after O
a O
meeting O
with O
Monti B-PER
, O
that O
" O
the O
rule O
will O
be O
abolished O
because O
only O
four O
companies O
in O
five O
years O
have O
benefited O
from O
it O
, O
at O
a O
clear O
disadvantage O
by O
having O
renounced O

" O
. O

The O
Navarrese O

explained O
that O
" O
firstly O
, O
the O
coordination O

of O
our O
regulations O
will O
be O
abolished O
and O
secondly O
the O
wrongly O
called O
tax O
vacations O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
this O
modification O
" O
we O
can O
do O
it O
briefly O
" O
. O

" O
We O
are O
currently O
in O
full O
negotiation O
process O
with O
the O
central O
government B-ORG
and O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
agree O
on O
the O
text O
of O
the O
modifications O
we O
will O
proceed O
to O
carry O
out O
this O
initiative O
" O
, O
he O
added O
. O

The O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
decided O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
file O
against O
the O
tax O
aid O
systems O
established O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
Navarre B-LOC
on O
July O
14 O
, O
1999 O
and O
, O
although O
the O
decision O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
immediate O
condemnation O
of O
the O
same O
, O
it O
can O
lead O
in O
theory O
to O
the O
obligation O
to O
repay O
the O
aid O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
Brussels B-ORG
made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
not O
questioning O
the O
fiscal O
competences O
that O
both O
communities O
have O
thanks O
to O
the O
Statute B-MISC
of I-MISC
Guernica I-MISC
and O
the O
Foral B-MISC
Statute I-MISC
of I-MISC
Navarre I-MISC
, O
but O
some O
measures O
of O
their O
regimes O
that O
it O
considered O
" O
discriminatory O
" O
and O
incompatible O
with O
the O
European O
rules O
of O
free O
competition O
. O

The O
then O
Commissioner O
for O
Competition B-MISC
, O
Karel B-PER
van I-PER
Miert I-PER
, O
argued O
that O
the O
Basque O
and O
Navarre O
aid O
has O
the O
characteristics O
of O
" O
State B-ORG
aid O
" O
and O
" O
may O
be O
considered O
illegal O
" O
because O
" O
it O
is O
financed O
with O
public O
resources O
, O
favors O
certain O
companies O
, O
distorts O
competition O
and O
affects O
trade O
between O
Member O
States B-ORG
" O
. O

Contrary O
to O
this O
opinion O
of O
the O
Commission B-ORG
, O
the O
President O
of O
Navarre O
said O
today O
that O
the O
tax O
aid O
of O
his O
community O
" O
in O
no O
case O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
State B-ORG
aid O
, O
since O
the O
four O
cases O
in O
which O
companies O
have O
opted O
for O
this O
type O
of O
tax O
aid O
have O
been O
able O
to O
deduct O
from O
corporate O
tax O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
million O
pesetas O
. O

Sanz B-PER
compared O
this O
amount O
with O
the O
528 O
million O
pesetas O
which O
, O
he O
said O
, O
these O
same O
companies O
could O
have O
saved O
if O
they O
had O
opted O
for O
direct O
aid O
for O
investment O
and O
employment O
on O
fixed O
assets O
: O
" O
but O
since O
our O
fiscal O
aid O
in O
the O
form O
of O
corporate O
tax O
exemptions O
is O
incompatible O
with O
direct O
aid O
, O
they O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
so O
and O
have O
been O
clearly O
disadvantaged O

Sanz B-PER
added O
that O

that O

With O
a O
view O

will O
play O

Second B-MISC

Zambrano B-PER
revealed O
his O
theory O
that O
the O

has O
to O
star O
" O
the O
same O
" O
who O
have O
relegated O
the O
team O
, O
along O

some O
incorporation O

the O
subsidiary O

" O
Atletico B-ORG

one O
of O
the O
best O
quarries O

There O
are O
two O
or O
three O
players O
from O

the O
leap O
, O
because O
they O
have O
been O
playing O
for O
several O
years O
in O
the O
second B-MISC
division O

But O
what O
I O
have O
very O
clear O
is O
that O
we O
have O
to O
climb O
to O
First O
we O
have O
to O
those O
who O
have O
lowered O
us O
plus O
certain O
tweaks O
, O
because O
there O
will O
be O
some O
who O
will O
have O
to O
go O
for O
the O
economy O
of O
the O
club O

he O

Zambrano B-PER
offered O
his O
vision O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC

the O
recipe O
that O

must O
apply O
to O
return O
in O
a O
year O
to O
Primera B-MISC

" O
In O
Segunda B-MISC

first O
you O

while O
in O
Primera B-MISC
, O
you O
have O
to O
play O
soccer O
and O
then O
fight O
. O

I O
think O
that O
Atletico B-ORG
will O
not O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
adapt O
because O
they O
have O
players O
to O
play O

said O

to O
be O

first O

" O

During O

speech O
to O
the O
General B-MISC
Assembly I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
CEOE I-MISC
held O
today O
in O
Madrid B-LOC
, O
the O
president O
of O
the O
employers O
said O
that O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
imminent O
globalization O
and O
internationalization O
of O
the O
economy O
, O
the O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG
" O
has O
ahead O
as O
many O
opportunities O
as O
dangers O
" O
. O

" O
The O
benchmark O
is O
the O
U.S. B-ORG
" O
, O
whose O
economic O
growth O
, O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
Cuevas B-PER
, O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Berlin B-MISC
Wall I-MISC
that O
generated O
the O
virtual O
disappearance O
of O
communism O
and O
the O
entry O
of O
many O
of O
these O
countries O
in O
the O
market O
economy O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
possibility O
of O
North O
America B-ORG
to O
invest O
in O
the O
civilian O
sphere O
what O
it O
previously O
destined O
to O
the O
military O
. O

Outside O
this O
framework O
of O
world O
prosperity O
, O
there O
are O
countries O
such O
as O
the O
African O
countries O
that O
do O
not O
have O
the O
capacity O
to O
join O
it O
and O
whose O
endemic O
evils O
are O
, O
according O
to O
Cuevas B-PER
, O
" O
tribalism O
, O
backwardness O
and O
incessant O
wars O
" O
. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
he O
recalled O
that O
more O
than O
six O
hundred O
companies O
have O
invested O
in O
Morocco B-LOC
in O
recent O
years O
and O
said O
that O
" O
the O
economic O
development O
of O
our O
southern O
neighbors O
is O
the O
best O
way O
to O
avoid O
excessive O
immigration O
flow O
" O
. O

For O
the O
president O
of O
the O
CEOE B-ORG
, O
globalization O
is O
" O
the O
great O
hope O
of O
the O
underdeveloped O
world O
" O
, O
although O
he O
pointed O
out O
that O
true O
globalization O
" O
which O
is O
economic O
" O
will O
not O
exist O
without O
the O
liberalization O
of O
world O
trade O
, O
" O
a O
very O
distant O
goal O
" O
although O
the O
recent O
entry O
of O
China B-ORG
into O
the O
World B-ORG
Trade I-ORG
Organization I-ORG
( O
WTO B-ORG
) O
" O
is O
a O
very O
important O
step O
" O
. O

Therefore O
, O
Cuevas B-PER
harshly O
criticized O
the O
anti O
- O
capitalist O
movements O
since O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
miserable O
peoples O
will O
not O
get O
ahead O
without O
entering O
the O
market O
economy O
, O
receive O
foreign O
investment O
, O
guarantee O
them O
with O
democratic O
political O
systems O
and O
develop O
their O
industrial O
capacities O
and O
their O
service O
sectors O
" O
. O

Faced O
with O
this O
problem O
, O
he O
said O
, O
the O
EU B-ORG
" O
does O
not O
play O
a O
clarifying O
role O
" O
because O
" O
it O
has O
limited O
its O
borders O
" O
to O
third O
world O
products O
and O
labor O
from O
poor O
areas O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
his O
speech O
, O
Cuevas B-PER
repeatedly O
cited O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
as O
an O
example O
both O
in O
terms O
of O
job O
creation O
rates O
" O
due O
to O
a O
policy O
of O
integration O
of O
foreign O
labor O
" O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
technological O
advances O
. O

For O
Spain B-ORG
, O
he O
asserted O
, O
" O
it O
is O
vital O
not O
to O
lose O
the O
capacities O
granted O
by O
the O
scientific O
- O
technical O
revolution O
" O
, O
for O
which O
he O
urged O
the O
public O
authorities O
to O
increase O
their O
investments O
and O
to O
consider O
" O
essential O
" O
the O
new O
communication O
networks O
. O

For O
Europe B-ORG
to O
increase O
its O
competitive O
advantages O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
USA B-ORG
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
that O
, O
among O
other O
measures O
, O
it O
cuts O
public O
spending O
, O
increases O
the O
quota O
of O
immigrants O
, O
does O
not O
reduce O
working O
hours O
, O
lowers O
inflationary O
tensions O
and O
increases O
its O
investment O
in O
R&D B-MISC
. O

As O
a O
consequence O
of O
these O
measures O
, O
already O
implemented O
in O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
, O
the O
dollar O
is O
a O
solid O
currency O
that O
" O
is O
gaining O
ground O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
euro O
" O
, O
he O
said O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
he O
said O
that O
the O
euro O
" O
pays O
one O
day O
after O
another O
various O
national O
mistakes O
" O
as O
the O
35 O
hours O
in O
France B-LOC
, O
the O
breach O
of O
the O
Stability B-MISC
Pact I-MISC
in O
Italy B-LOC
and O
excessive O
wage O
growth O
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

In O
short O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
there O
are O
many O
and O
very O
deep O
structural O
reforms O
" O
that O
Europe B-ORG
must O
face O
, O
despite O
which O
, O
in O
recent O
years O
Spain B-ORG
has O
been O
at O
the O
forefront O
of O
European O
growth O
and O
has O
reduced O
the O
income O
differential O
that O
separated O
it O
from O
the O
EU B-ORG
average O
and O
has O
gone O
from O
78 O
to O
82 O
percent O
. O

Finally O
, O
Cuevas B-PER
listed O
some O
of O
the O
objectives O
of O
the O
CEOE B-ORG
for O
the O
coming O
years O
as O
achieving O

" O
welcoming O

would O
benefit O
from O
a O
simple O
66 O

only O

The O
Pitiusan O

consider O
that O
the O

those O
of O

that O
only O
68 O

. O

As O
a O
justification O
for O
this O
fact O
, O
40 O
percent O
of O
the O
businessmen O
adduce O
lack O
of O
available O
time O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O

after O
a O
meeting O
with O
Monti B-PER
, O
that O
" O
the O

will O
be O
abolished O
because O
only O
four O

at O
a O

disadvantage O
by O

The O
Navarrese O

that O
" O

" O

The O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
decided O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
file O
against O
the O

systems O
established O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC

Navarre B-LOC
on O
July O
14 O
, O
1999 O
and O
, O
although O
the O
decision O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
immediate O
condemnation O
of O
the O
same O
, O
it O
can O
lead O
in O
theory O
to O
the O
obligation O
to O
repay O
the O

On O
that O
occasion O
Brussels B-ORG
made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
not O
questioning O
the O
fiscal O
competences O
that O
both O

have O
thanks O
to O
the O
Statute B-MISC
of I-MISC
Guernica I-MISC
and O
the O
Foral B-MISC
Statute I-MISC
of I-MISC
Navarre I-MISC
, O
but O
some O
measures O
of O
their O
regimes O
that O
it O
considered O
" O
discriminatory O
" O
and O
incompatible O
with O
the O
European O
rules O
of O
free O
competition O
. O

The O
then O
Commissioner O
for O
Competition B-MISC
, O
Karel B-PER
van I-PER
Miert I-PER
, O
argued O
that O
the O
Basque O
and O
Navarre O
aid O
has O
the O
characteristics O
of O
" O
State B-ORG
aid O
" O
and O
" O
may O
be O
considered O
illegal O
" O
because O
" O
it O
is O
financed O
with O
public O
resources O
, O
favors O
certain O
companies O
, O
distorts O
competition O
and O
affects O

" O
. O

Contrary O
to O
this O
opinion O
of O
the O
Commission B-ORG
, O
the O
President O

said O
today O
that O
the O
tax O
aid O
of O
his O
community O
" O
in O
no O
case O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
State B-ORG
aid O
, O
since O
the O
four O
cases O
in O
which O
companies O
have O
opted O
for O
this O
type O
of O
tax O
aid O
have O
been O
able O
to O
deduct O
from O
corporate O
tax O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
million O
pesetas O
. O

Sanz B-PER
compared O
this O
amount O
with O
the O
528 O
million O

which O
, O
he O
said O
, O
these O
same O
companies O
could O
have O
saved O
if O
they O
had O
opted O
for O
direct O
aid O
for O
investment O

assets O
: O
" O
but O
since O
our O
fiscal O
aid O
in O
the O
form O
of O
corporate O
tax O
exemptions O
is O
incompatible O
with O
direct O
aid O
, O
they O

not O

However O
, O
the O

been O

criticism O
from O

called O
Intercultural B-ORG
Council I-ORG
and O
the O
Confederation B-ORG
of I-ORG
German I-ORG
Trade O

( O
DGB B-ORG
) O
against O
statements O
by O

, O
who O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
said O
that O
Germany B-LOC
had O
exceeded O
the O
limits O
of O

of O

The O
Intercultural B-ORG

has O
urged O
the O

to O
retract O
his O
words O
and O
to O
formulate O
what O
are O
the O
objectives O
of O
the O
governmental O
Alliance B-ORG
against I-ORG
Racism I-ORG
, O
which O
it O
blames O
for O
not O
even O
having O
issued O
a O
clear O
statement O
of O
its O
intentions O
. O

Likewise O
, O
Amnesty B-ORG
International I-ORG

accuse O
the O

of O
not O
having O
invited O

to O
participate O
in O
it O

Schily B-PER
rejected O
these O

alternatives O
that O

explained O
today O
in O
the O
Parliament B-LOC

on O
the O
occasion O
of O
a O
question O
posed O
by O
the O
PP B-ORG
, O
that O
during O
these O
months O
the O
technicians O
of O
his O
department O
are O
analyzing O
which O
solution O
of O
the O
two O
is O
the O
most O
convenient O
. O

The O
two O
solutions O
have O
a O
similar O
cost O
- O
about O
35,000 O
million O
- O
, O
and O
while O
the O
pipeline O
has O
a O
lower O
environmental O
impact O
because O
it O
does O
not O
require O
the O
provision O
of O
deposits O
, O
has O
the O
disadvantage O
of O
the O
material O
limitation O
of O
the O
amount O
of O
gas O
that O
can O
be O
driven O
to O
the O
islands O
through O
the O
submarine O
tubes O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
transporting O
the O
gas O
by O
ship O
to O
the O
archipelago O
involves O
the O
installation O
of O
a O
transformer O
station O
, O
but O
has O
the O
positive O
aspect O
that O
, O
if O
in O
the O
future O
a O
greater O
quantity O
of O
this O
element O
is O
required O
, O
it O
is O
enough O
to O
increase O
the O
number O
of O
trips O
of O
ships O
from O
the O
Peninsula B-LOC
. O

The O
report O
that O
will O
opt O
for O
one O
of O
the O
two O
solutions O
will O
be O
completed O
in O
September O
, O
when O
it O
will O
be O
presented O
to O
the O
territorial O
policy O

From O
September O
will O
open O
a O
public O
exhibition O
period O
of O
two O
months O
to O
collect O
the O
relevant O
allegations O
and O
, O
according O
to O
the O
schedule O
handled O
by O
Ramon B-PER
, O
in O
November O
or O
December O
the O
Consell B-ORG
de I-ORG

will O
approve O
this O
Energy B-MISC

With O
this O

Master I-MISC
Plan I-MISC
is O
expected O
to O
meet O
the O
demand O
of O
the O

and O
has O
plans O
for O
energy O

and O
use O
of O

, O
as O
reported O
Ramon B-PER
, O
who O
added O
that O
of O
the O
12 O
sections O
of O
this O
project O
, O
6 O
are O
completed O
and O
the O
rest O
are O
in O
a O
very O
advanced O
stage O
. O

From O
the O
PP B-ORG
, O
the O
deputy O
Cristófol B-PER
Huguet I-PER
criticized O
that O
the O
Executive B-ORG
is O
currently O
considering O
one O
of O
the O
two O
solutions O
after O
the O
previous O
autonomous O
Government B-ORG
decided O
last O
year O
the O
installation O
of O
a O
gas O
station O
and O
brought O
by O
ship O
from O
the O
Peninsula B-LOC
. O

This O
" O
delay O
" O
is O
" O
a O
step O
backwards O
" O
that O
may O
lead O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
installation O
of O
this O
infrastructure O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
PP B-ORG
today O
requested O
that O
the O

appear O
in O
a O
parliamentary O
committee O
to O
account O

said O
that O
another O

, O

indicated O
that O
the O

due O
to O
the O

of O

, O
but O
justified O
this O
situation O
in O
the O
lower O

" O

stressed O
the O
particular O

Salva B-PER

that O
these O

that O
, O
" O
I O

her O
his O
unilateral O
decision O
to O
break O
the O
relationship O
and O
return O
to O
his O
first O
wife O
, O
but O
the O
sentence O
considers O
that O
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
such O
" O
imposed O
break O
" O
is O
the O
statement O
of O
the O
defendant O
. O

The O
sentence O
is O
also O
based O
on O
the O
numerous O
injuries O
suffered O
by O
the O
woman O
when O
she O
was O
beaten O
in O
the O
open O
field O
, O
which O
produced O
" O
bruises O
in O
both O

, O
bruising O

area O
, O
facial O
contusions O
and O
cracking O
of O
the O
tenth O
rib O
" O
, O
for O
which O
the O
judges O
impose O
the O
defendant O
six O
weekends O
of O
arrest O
. O

The O
sentence O
says O
that O
these O
" O
spectacular O
stigmata O
of O
violence O
" O
, O
although O
produced O
at O
a O
time O
prior O
to O
the O
sexual O
act O
, O
are O
further O
evidence O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
consent O
of O
the O
victim O
, O
since O
" O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
violence O
required O
in O
sexual O
assaults O
with O
vaginal O
penetration O
need O
not O
fall O
precisely O
on O
the O
genital O
area O
" O
. O

The O
judges O
refer O
to O
the O
" O
inconsistencies O
" O
in O
the O
version O
of O
the O
accused O
, O
since O
" O
if O
he O
had O
been O
a O
year O
expressing O
his O
desire O
to O
return O
to O
his O
family O
, O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
explain O
why O
only O
a O
month O
before O
the O
facts O
began O
to O
live O
together O
" O
nor O
why O
" O
he O
went O
to O
look O
for O
her O
at O
the O
disco O
late O
at O
night O
" O
. O

" O
Unless O
the O
relations O
were O
mounted O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
most O
elementary O
sadomasochism O
" O
- O
adds O
the O
sentence O
- O
it O
is O
not O
understood O
that O
" O
a O
woman O
who O
has O
just O
been O
brutally O
assaulted O
immediately O
manifests O
itself O
ready O
to O
throw O
pelillos O
to O
the O
sea O
and O
throw O
herself O
into O
the O
arms O
of O
her O
assailant O
to O
have O
sex O
with O
him O
not O
once O
, O
but O
twice O
in O
the O
version O
of O
this O
" O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
verdict O
rejects O
the O
acquittal O
requested O
by O
the O
prosecutor O

the O
defense O

imposes O

Two O
works O
that O
have O
been O
enough O
to O
consider O
Rulfo B-PER
one O
of O
the O
summits O
of O

in O
Spanish O
and O
which O
were O
followed O
by O
a O

a O
great O
enigma O
about O
what O
he O

he O
destroyed O

" O
He O
wanted O

and O
he O
succeeded O
with O
Pedro B-MISC

Little O
given O
to O

gathered O

more O
concerned O
about O
founding O
a O
family O

to O
find O
an O
autonomous O
refuge O
, O
Rulfo B-PER
had O
to O
face O
the O
misgivings O
of O
literary O
circles O
in O

country O

" O
When O
it O
was O
published O
it O
did O
not O
sell O
, O
he O
had O
to O
give O
it O
away O
, O
they O
did O
not O
understand O
it O
" O
The O
life O
of O
a O
writer O
is O
very O
difficult O
, O
I O
saw O
him O
suffer O
a O
lot O
in O
the O
face O
of O
so O
much O
attack O
. O

And O
now O
they O
want O
him O
to O
have O
written O
more O
, O
what O
for O
? O

" O
asks O
Clara B-PER
Aparicio I-PER
, O
who O
assures O
that O
her O
husband O
" O
was O
not O
treated O
fairly O
in O
Mexico B-LOC
" O
. O

" O
It O
seems O
unbelievable O
that O
among O
themselves O
( O
writers O
) O
want O
to O
be O
better O
than O
each O
other O
. O

Clara B-PER
Aparicio I-PER
believes O
that O
in O
the O
letters O
you O
can O
see O
how O
the O
work O
of O
Juan B-PER
Rulfo I-PER
was O
formed O
( O
" O
in O
each O
of O
them O
you O
see O
the O
writer O
" O
) O
, O
that O
even O
in O
them O
you O
can O
reveal O
the O
origin O
of O
some O
of O
the O
phrases O
that O
appear O
in O
his O
novel O
, O
and O
responds O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
a O
" O
god O
knows O
" O
when O
asked O
if O
she O
was O
the O
inspiration O
for O
any O
of O
his O
characters O
. O

Since O
he O
sent O
them O
, O
Rulfo B-PER
never O
knew O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
letters O
, O
which O
his O
then O
girlfriend O
kept O
, O
always O
after O
his O
mother O
read O
them O
. O

Only O
on O
occasion O
, O
at O
the O
writer O
's O
own O
funeral O
, O
or O
in O
a O
fragmentary O
manner O
in O
publications O
or O
exhibitions O
have O
come O
to O
light O
. O

After O
denying O
permission O
to O
publish O
them O
several O
times O
and O
fearing O
that O
they O
were O
appearing O
without O
him O
, O
Clara B-PER
Aparicio I-PER
decided O
to O
give O
the O
green O
light O
to O
this O
book O
, O
which O
has O
only O
been O
excluded O
a O
small O
letter O
in O
which O
he O
lamented O
an O
operation O
. O

Rulfo B-PER

passion O
for O

will O
also O
give O

Within O
the O
apathy O

disillusionment O
with O
the O
opposition O
to O
Yugoslav O
President O
Slobodan B-PER
Milosevic I-PER

the O
population O

begun O

play O
cards O

a O
deck O
of O
cards O
in O
which O
their O
caricatured O
leaders O
paint O
hearts O
, O
clubs O

other O
suits O

These O
decks O
were O
sold O
four O
days O

for O
the O
equivalent O
of O
two O

, O
the O
few O
that O

The O
king O

in O
the O
deck O
is O
Milosevic B-PER

incombustible O
for O
a O
decade O
to O
three O

black O

The O
third O
king O
is O
the O
conservative O
ultranationalist O
Vojislav B-PER
Seselj I-PER

who O
appears O
weighing O
a O
stake O
in O
his O
hands O

alluding O
to O
his O
reputation O
as O
" O
the O
bad O
guy O
of O
Milosevic B-PER

, O
always O
ready O
to O
execute O
the O
ugly O
that O
he O
wants O

fourth O
one O
is O

faded O
opponent O
Zoran B-PER

Yesterday O

the O

The O

the O
balance O

The O

one O
of O
the O
solutions O
proposed O
by O
those O
responsible O

overcome O
this O
situation O
would O
involve O
amending O
the O
law O
regulating O
the O
labor O
body O
to O
prevent O
vetoes O
that O
hinder O
its O
operation O
. O

The O
other O
solution O
pointed O
out O
goes O
through O
the O
adoption O
of O
the O
French O
system O
, O
which O
provides O
, O
rather O
than O
a O

delivery O

although O
in O

cases O

the O

The O
sentence O
of O
the O
Fourth B-ORG
Section I-ORG
, O
to O
which O
Efe B-ORG
has O
had O
access O
, O
says O
that O
the O
version O
of O
the O
victim O
has O
more O
" O
internal O
consistency O
" O
and O
more O
" O
convincing O
force O
of O
the O
testimony O
as O
a O
whole O
" O
than O
that O
offered O
by O
the O
defendant O
, O
defined O
as O
" O
implausible O
and O
full O
of O
inconsistencies O
" O
. O

The O
defendant O
argued O
at O
trial O
that O
the O
relations O
were O
consensual O
and O
attributed O
the O
complaint O
to O
the O
resentment O
of O
his O
ex O
- O
girlfriend O
because O
he O
had O
just O
communicated O
to O
her O
his O
unilateral O
decision O
to O
break O
the O
relationship O
and O
return O
to O
his O
first O
wife O
, O
but O
the O
sentence O
considers O
that O
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
such O
" O
imposed O
break O
" O
is O
the O
statement O
of O
the O
defendant O
. O

The O
sentence O
is O
also O
based O
on O
the O
numerous O
injuries O
suffered O
by O
the O
woman O
when O
she O
was O
beaten O
in O
the O
open O
field O
, O
which O
produced O
" O
bruises O
in O
both O
armpits O
, O
bruising O
in O
the O
left O
ear O
, O
bruising O
in O
the O
temporal O

, O
bruising O
in O
the O
right O
eyebrow O
, O
bruising O
in O

, O
facial O
contusions O
and O

the O
tenth O
rib O
" O
, O
for O
which O
the O
judges O
impose O
the O
defendant O
six O
weekends O
of O
arrest O
. O

The O
sentence O
says O
that O
these O
" O
spectacular O
stigmata O
of O
violence O
" O
, O
although O
produced O
at O
a O
time O
prior O
to O
the O
sexual O
act O
, O
are O
further O
evidence O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
consent O
of O
the O
victim O
, O
since O
" O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
violence O
required O

said O
today O
that O
the O
Gipuzkoa O

has O
no O
options O
to O
access O
the O
Spanish O

, O
since O
in O
his O
opinion O
" O
it O
is O
impossible O
" O
to O

Clemente B-PER

today O

when O
he O
said O
that O

it O

The O

commented O
that O
the O
recourse O
to O
make O

their O
termination O
clauses O
is O
not O
viable O
for O
the O
club O
Donostia O
, O
because O
the O
high O
price O
to O
be O
paid O
makes O
these O
players O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
" O
incomprable O
for O

" O
, O
so O
he O
advised O
to O
go O
to O
the O
international O
market O
where O
compensation O
is O
" O

" O
. O

The O
Real B-ORG

" O
a O

that O

to O

" O
the O
reason O
for O

that O

As O

by O

winning O

in O
a O
statement O
from O
the O
Government B-ORG

Navarra I-ORG
, O
the O
woman O
who O
has O
had O
a O
breast O
amputated O
" O
usually O
withdraws O
from O
dressing O
as O
she O
did O
before O
, O
is O
embarrassed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
pool O
or O
the O
beach O
, O
and O
may O
even O
be O
affected O
in O
their O
sex O
life O
" O
. O

Therefore O
, O
they O
added O
, O
breast O
reconstruction O
is O
not O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
aesthetic O
character O
, O
but O
it O
is O
one O
more O
part O
of O
the O
comprehensive O
treatment O
of O
breast O
cancer O
that O
helps O
women O
to O
return O
to O
their O
ordinary O
life O
with O
absolute O
normality O
. O

Breast O
reconstruction O
, O
depending O
on O
each O
patient O
, O
can O
be O
performed O
immediately O
, O
in O
the O
same O
operation O
in O
which O
the O
mastectomy O
is O
performed O
, O
or O
deferred O
, O
after O
having O
overcome O
all O
the O
complementary O
treatments O
to O
the O
disease O
of O
the O
oncological O
patient O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
are O
various O
surgical O
techniques O
to O
restore O
the O
breast O
, O
which O
are O
applied O
according O
to O
the O
physical O
characteristics O
of O
the O
patient O
, O
the O
type O
of O
cancer O
she O
has O
or O
the O
subsequent O
treatment O
that O
still O
awaits O
her O
. O

These O
techniques O
, O
whose O
application O
extends O
the O
award O
- O
winning O
work O
, O
are O
basically O
divided O
into O
autologous O
, O
those O
in O
which O
the O
breast O
is O
reconstructed O
with O
the O
woman O
's O
own O
tissues O
obtained O
from O
the O
back O
or O
abdomen O
, O
and O
those O
that O
use O
synthetic O
materials O
. O

The O
autologous O
techniques O
, O
according O
to O
the O
specialists O
, O
" O
have O
the O
advantage O
that O
they O
do O
not O
produce O
rejection O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
breast O
is O
the O
woman O
's O
own O
and O
with O
the O
passage O
of O
time O
it O
adapts O
to O
the O
changes O
in O
her O
physique O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
the O
patient O
puts O
on O
weight O
, O
the O
reconstructed O
breast O
also O
enlarges O
. O

However O
, O
the O
downside O
" O
is O
that O
it O
leaves O
visible O
sequelae O
where O
it O
has O
gone O
in O
search O
of O
tissue O
, O
although O
we O
have O
improved O
a O
lot O
lately O
to O
minimize O
these O
scars O
. O

Breast O
reconstruction O
using O
expanders O
and O
silicone O
prostheses O
is O
an O
alternative O
to O
autologous O
techniques O
that O
" O
does O
not O
leave O
any O
sequelae O
in O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
and O
aesthetically O
give O
a O
good O
result O
, O
although O
they O
can O
produce O
rejection O
by O
the O
patient O

recalled O

know O
the O

it O

González B-PER
Ballesta I-PER
explained O
that O
the O
PP B-ORG
refuses O
the O
initiative O
because O
in O

" O
there O
is O
no O
proven O
scientific O
evidence O
" O
that O
demonstrates O
a O
" O
decisive O
effectiveness O
" O
of O
this O

although O
he O
defended O
others O
such O
as O
the O
" O
narcosala O
" O
which O
opened O
today O
in O
Madrid B-LOC

where O
drug O

can O
administer O
the O
drug O
they O
themselves O

they O
will O
be O
accompanied O
by O
a O
medical O
team O

In O
her O
presentation O
of O
the O
proposal O
, O
Isabel B-PER
Salazar I-PER
began O
by O
clarifying O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O
" O
special O
selection O
" O
of O
patients O
to O
whom O
doctors O
would O
prescribe O
heroin O
and O
that O
there O
would O
be O
no O
question O
of O
creating O
centers O
for O
" O
indiscriminate O
distribution O
of O
heroin O
" O
, O
nor O
the O
aforementioned O
" O
narcosalas O
" O
. O

Salazar B-PER
insisted O
on O
the O
need O
to O
end O
the O
marginalization O
of O
drug O
addicts O
and O
ensure O
that O
they O
also O
enjoy O
the O
benefits O
of O

The O
BNG B-ORG
adhered O
to O
the O
initiative O
and O
his O
deputy O
Xosé B-PER
Francisco I-PER
Ferreiro I-PER
considered O
it O

that O
the O
reality O

two O
structural O

In O

Caixa B-ORG

said O
that O
the O
incorporation O
of O

assets O

the O

market O
is O
biased O
by O
the O
aging O
of O
the O
population O

which O
meant O
that O
in O
the O
last O
two O

there O
was O
a O
fall O

the O

favored O
the O
containment O

levels O
. O

The O
Galician O
economic O
structure O
, O
he O
said O
, O
had O
to O
face O
an O
intense O
transformation O

from O
the O
loss O
of O

, O
Professor O

Deusto I-ORG
, O
spoke O
about O
the O
legality O
and O
regime O
of O

in O

. O

According O
to O
Lledó B-PER
, O
" O
the O
athlete O
can O
leave O
the O
discipline O
of O
his O
club O
without O
waiting O
for O
the O
termination O

For O

" O

, O
being O
a O
voluntary O
goodbye O
" O
, O
which O
the O
lecturer O
clarified O
" O
is O
not O
a O
breach O
of O

" O
. O

For O
Cardenal B-PER
" O
judicial O
action O
allows O
us O
to O
deduce O
that O
the O
current O

not O
sustainable O
" O
. O

" O
This O
approach O
- O
he O
said O
- O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
historical O
origin O
of O
Royal B-MISC
Decree I-MISC
1006 I-MISC
of O
1985 O
, O
which O
is O
contrary O
to O
the O

followed O
today O
in O
the O
sports O
labor O
market O
" O
. O

The O
Bilbao O
lawyer O
Cardenal B-PER
maintained O
that O
" O
the O
clauses O
are O
only O
valid O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
, O
to O
athletes O
, O
it O
is O
convenient O
to O
pay O
them O
in O
each O
specific O
case O
" O
. O

Cardenal B-PER
pointed O
out O
that O
judges O
, O
in O
their O
verdicts O
, O
already O
at O
least O
ten O
cases O
in O
Spain B-LOC
, O
" O
feel O
inclined O
to O
lower O
the O
figures O
of O
the O
clauses O
in O
cases O
where O
athletes O
and O
clubs O
go O
to O
a O
legal O
dispute O
, O
always O
after O
a O
personalized O
assessment O
: O
specific O
player O
, O
specific O
club O
" O
. O

For O
Lledó B-PER
there O
are O
special O
situations O
, O
such O
as O
when O
a O
sportsman O
-mainly O
in O
football- O
, O
signed O
for O
high O
millionaire O
figures O
, O
is O
kept O
in O
substitution O
by O
the O
coach O
. O

Faced O
with O
this O
situation O
, O
" O
the O

a O

, O
cases O
of O

, O
whose O
repeated O
non O

" O
. O

Lledó B-PER
commented O
that O
" O
his O
desire O
to O
move O
can O
not O
be O
interpreted O
as O
a O
breach O
of O
contract O
" O
. O

He O
continued O
: O
" O
It O
seems O
appropriate O
to O
enter O
into O
negotiations O
to O
reach O
a O
club O

pact O
so O
that O
the O

, O
after O
a O
meeting O
with O
Monti B-PER
, O
that O
" O
the O

only O

The O

" O
We O

The O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
decided O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
file O
against O
the O
tax O
aid O
systems O
established O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
Navarre B-LOC
on O
July O
14 O
, O
1999 O
and O
, O
although O
the O
decision O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
immediate O
condemnation O
of O
the O
same O
, O
it O
can O
lead O
in O
theory O
to O
the O
obligation O

repay O
the O

. O

On O
that O
occasion O
Brussels B-LOC
made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
not O
questioning O
the O
fiscal O
competences O
that O
both O

have O
thanks O
to O
the O
Statute B-MISC
of I-MISC
Guernica I-MISC
and O
the O
Foral B-MISC
Statute I-MISC
of I-MISC
Navarre I-MISC
, O
but O
some O
measures O
of O
their O
regimes O
that O
it O
considered O
" O
discriminatory O
" O
and O
incompatible O
with O
the O
European O
rules O
of O
free O
competition O
. O

The O
then O
Commissioner O
for O

, O
Karel B-PER

, O
argued O
that O
the O
Basque O

Navarre O

has O
the O
characteristics O
of O
" O
State B-ORG
aid O
" O
and O
" O
may O
be O
considered O
illegal O
" O
because O
" O
it O
is O
financed O
with O
public O
resources O
, O
favors O
certain O
companies O
, O
distorts O
competition O
and O
affects O

Member O

" O
. O

Contrary O
to O
this O
opinion O
of O
the O
Commission B-ORG
, O
the O
President O
of O
Navarre O
said O
today O
that O
the O
tax O
aid O
of O
his O
community O
" O
in O
no O
case O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
State B-ORG
aid O
, O
since O
the O
four O
cases O
in O
which O
companies O
have O
opted O
for O
this O
type O
of O
tax O
aid O
have O
been O
able O
to O
deduct O
from O
corporate O
tax O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
million O
pesetas O
. O

Sanz B-PER
compared O
this O
amount O
with O
the O
528 O
million O
pesetas O
which O
, O
he O
said O
, O
these O
same O
companies O
could O
have O
saved O
if O
they O
had O
opted O
for O
direct O
aid O
for O
investment O
and O
employment O
on O
fixed O
assets O
: O
" O
but O
since O
our O
fiscal O
aid O
in O
the O
form O
of O
corporate O
tax O
exemptions O
is O
incompatible O
with O
direct O
aid O
, O
they O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
so O
and O
have O
been O
clearly O
disadvantaged O
" O

Sanz B-PER
added O
that O
, O
with O

Sanz B-PER
said O
that O
" O
to O
proceed O
with O

The O
president O
made O
these O
statements O
in O
Brussels B-LOC
, O
where O
today O
he O
met O
with O
the O
European O
Commissioner O
for O
Competition B-MISC
, O
Mario B-PER

, O
to O
whom O
he O
announced O
the O
forthcoming O

of O
the O

against O
which O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
opened O
a O
file O
last O

. O

The O
president O
of O
Navarre O
added O
that O
the O
opposition O
" O
tries O
to O
capture O
wills O
around O
the O
electorate O
saying O
: O
we O
want O
the O
highway O
of O
Navarre B-LOC
to O
be O
free O
for O
all O
the O
citizens O
without O
contemplating O
and O
without O
telling O
them O
the O
counterpart O
that O
this O
supposes O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
" O
rescuing O
the O
highway O
and O
making O
it O
free O
of O
charge O
logically O
means O
giving O
up O
a O
series O
of O
other O
important O
services O
" O
. O

He O
stated O
that O
given O
that O
the O
cost O
of O
this O
measure O
would O
be O
between O
60,000 O
and O
140,000 O
million O
and O
taking O
into O
account O
that O
the O
Navarre O
budget O
is O
376,000 O
million O
, O
the O
decision O
to O
rescue O
it O
would O
imply O
" O
having O
to O
cede O
or O
close O
some O
services O
which O
are O
essential O
and O
which O
are O
in O
great O
demand O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
explained O
that O
he O
does O
not O
want O
to O
be O
responsible O
" O
for O
putting O
at O
risk O
the O
economic O
viability O
of O
Navarre B-LOC
because O
I O
am O
aware O
that O
whoever O
puts O
it O
at O
risk O
also O
puts O
at O
risk O
the O
political O
viability O
of O
Navarre B-LOC
as O
a O
differentiated O
community O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
he O
understood O
this O
position O
coming O
from O
" O
some O
initiative O
of O
some O
parliamentary O
group O
" O
that O
" O
does O
not O
believe O
in O
the O
political O
viability O
of O
Navarre B-LOC
as O
a O
differentiated O
community O
" O
" O
They O
ask O
for O
the O
rescue O
of O
the O
highway O
and O
its O
release O
parties O
like O
Eusko B-ORG
Alkartasuna I-ORG
and O
do O
not O
ask O
for O
it O
in O
their O
communities O
, O
where O
they O
have O
responsibility O
of O
Government B-ORG
, O
because O
there O
is O
the O
paradox O
that O
EA B-ORG
has O
responsibilities O
of O
Government B-ORG
in O
the O
Basque O
autonomous O
community O
and O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
any O
measure O
raised O
by O
EA B-ORG
in O
the O
Basque O
community O
raising O
the O
rescue O
of O
a O
highway O
and O
the O
release O
of O
toll O
" O
, O
he O
added O
. O

He O
insisted O
that O
the O
rescue O
of O
the O
highway O
means O
a O
" O
major O
risk O
and O
to O
date O
, O
except O
for O
insults O
, O
no O
one O
puts O
numbers O
on O
the O
table O
to O
disprove O
what O
I O
and O
my O
government B-ORG
are O
saying O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
rejected O
any O
intention O
to O
resign O
or O
to O
bring O
forward O
the O
elections O
and O
stated O
that O
this O
has O
been O
" O
an O
interpretation O
of O

" O
. O

The O
president O
concluded O
by O
saying O
: O
" O
blind O
sticks O
are O
being O
given O
by O
certain O
political O
parties O
because O
they O
have O
a O
bad O
conscience O
" O
. O

" O
Deep O
down O
they O
think O
the O
same O
way O
I O
think O
but O
they O
act O
less O
responsibly O
than O
the O
party O
that O
supports O
the O
Government B-ORG
because O
as O
they O
are O
in O
the O
opposition O
they O
do O
not O
care O
what O
they O
say O
with O
the O
sole O
purpose O
of O
trying O
to O
make O
politics O
. O

I O
act O
responsibly O

that O
" O
it O

said O
that O
the O

the O

to O
transform O
the O

, O
which O
in O
the O

the O

The O
writer O
and O
essayist O
harshly O
criticized O
the O
presence O
of O
experts O
who O
work O
for O
the O
media O
, O
which O
he O
said O
represent O
a O
reality O
in O
which O
" O
the O
personal O
experience O
of O
the O
public O
is O
useless O
, O
which O
deprives O
the O
critical O

leads O

Jimenez B-PER
Lozano I-PER
pointed O
out O
that O
with O
this O
way O

the O

" O

" O
, O
adding O
that O

" O

greater O
skill O

so O
" O

above O
the O
importance O

. O

For O
the O
writer O
from O
Avila O
, O
the O
relationship O
between O
journalism O
and O
classical O
culture O
has O
always O
been O
equivocal O
, O
because O
" O
the O
big O
issues O
need O
books O
and O
masterly O
nuance O
, O
otherwise O
, O
they O
come O
out O
cheap O
pastiches O

the O

The O

today O
that O
this O

surreal O
, O
several O
months O
before O

completed O
" O
. O

For O
its O
part O
, O
the O
newspaper O
" O
France B-ORG

" O
recalls O
that O
the O
researchers O
who O
deciphered O

had O
already O
found O
fewer O
genes O
and O
that O
, O
when O
extrapolated O
to O
the O

of O
the O

heritage O
, O
they O
concluded O
that O

40,000 O

The O
newspaper O
explains O
that O
the O
results O
of O
the O
French O

were O
obtained O
from O
the O

" O

According O
to O
Weissenbach B-PER
, O
" O
before O
the O
end O
of O
this O
year O
should O
be O
known O
90 O
percent O
of O
the O
human O
genetic O
heritage O
and O
the O
controversy O
over O
the O
number O
of O
genes O
should O
calm O
down O
then O
" O
. O

" O
The O
difference O
( O
... O
) O
comes O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
once O
you O
have O
broken O
the O
DNA B-MISC
into O
pieces O
, O
you O
do O
not O
always O
know O
how O
to O
put O
together O

In O
his O

the O
difference O

The O

, O
according O
to O
Alemany B-PER

this O
circumstance O
was O
not O
due O

Pinochet B-PER
, O
who O
faces O
more O
than O
a O

a O

on O
the O

an O
incident O

prescription O

that O
he O
should O
appoint O
a O
lawyer O
, O
which O
he O
refused O
because O
, O
according O
to O
his O
defenders O
, O
it O
would O
mean O
recognizing O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
Buenos O

" O
Now O
we O
understand O
why O
nothing O

despite O
. O
that O

added O

now O

, O
in O

the O
process O
was O
able O
to O
continue O
and O
the O
verification O

gave O
rise O

the O
fact O
that O
today O

already O

that O
the O

mayor O
of O
the O
Santiago O

In O
her O
opinion O
, O
there O
will O
be O
no O

it O

that O
the O

is O
that O

" O

not O

not O

The O
Venezuelan O
Minister O
of O
Defense B-MISC
, O
General O
Ismael B-PER
Hurtado I-PER
, O
considered O
" O
offensive O
" O
that O
the O
Catholic O
Episcopate B-ORG
described O
the O
military O
institution O
as O
a O
" O
praetorian O
arm O
" O
of O
the O
Government B-ORG
of O
President O
Hugo B-PER
Chávez I-PER
. O

In O
a O
private O
letter O
sent O
by O
Hurtado B-PER
to O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Episcopal B-MISC
Conference I-MISC
, O
Baltazar B-PER
Porras I-PER
, O
and O
leaked O
today O
by O
the O
press O
, O
the O
Minister O
points O
out O
that O
the O
representative O
of O
the O
Bishops O
" O
underestimates O
and O
offends O
the O
National B-ORG
Armed I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
" O
by O
questioning O
their O
democratic O
vocation O
. O

The O
Minister O
of O
Defense B-MISC
rejects O
the O
adjectives O
of O
" O
praetorian O
arm O
of O
the O
Government B-ORG
and O
praetorianism O
" O
that O
Porras B-PER
attributed O
to O
the O
military O
institution O
. O

General O
Hurtado B-PER
recalls O
in O
his O
letter O
that O
in O
the O
military O
ranks O
there O
are O
many O
members O
of O
the O
Catholic O
Church B-ORG
who O
serve O
as O
military O
chaplains O
, O
so O
he O
suggested O
that O
they O
should O
be O
asked O
if O
they O
feel O
they O
are O
soldiers O
of O
an O
emperor O
. O

Hurtado B-PER
also O
calls O
it O
" O
inconsiderate O
" O
to O
speak O
of O
an O
alleged O
" O
fragility O
" O
of O
the O
Armed O
Forces B-ORG
, O
because O
, O
he O
says O
, O
the O
men O
and O
women O
who O
exercise O
their O
role O
as O
leaders O
within O
that O
armed O
institution O
allow O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
division O
. O

He O
likewise O
rejects O
the O
doubts O
expressed O
by O
Porras B-PER
to O
an O
alleged O
inability O
of O
the O
Armed B-ORG
Forces I-ORG
to O
guarantee O
the O
transparency O
of O
the O
electoral O
process O
next O
Sunday O
, O
since O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
military O
will O
be O
able O
to O
vote O
. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
Episcopal B-MISC
Conference I-MISC
affirmed O
today O
that O
" O
it O
does O
not O
make O
any O
sense O
" O
to O
put O
two O
institutions O
of O
such O
prestige O
as O
the O
Catholic O
Church B-ORG
and O
the O
Armed B-ORG
Forces I-ORG
to O
fight O
, O
which O
he O
attributed O
to O
interests O
that O
seek O
to O
divert O
the O
attention O
on O
the O
electoral O
process O
. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
Monsignor O
Roberto B-PER
Luckert I-PER
, O
bishop O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Coro B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
western O
part O
of O
the O
country O
, O
assured O
that O
the O
Church B-ORG
has O
always O
been O
respectful O
of O
the O
armed O
institution O
, O
and O
clarified O
that O
what O
the O
letter O
of O
the O
bishops O
intended O
was O
to O
" O
alert O
" O
Hurtado B-PER
on O
what O
could O
be O
a O
" O
mismanagement O
" O
of O
the O
Armed B-ORG
Forces I-ORG
. O

The O
bishop O
clarified O
that O
the O
qualification O
of O
" O
praetorian O
guard O
" O
was O
only O
a O
warning O
so O
that O
the O
Army B-ORG
does O
not O
become O
an O
elite O
and O
personal O
body O
of O
the O
president O
. O

For O
Luckert B-PER
, O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
letter O
of O
the O
Catholic O
hierarchy O
was O
to O
give O
a O
" O
slap O
in O
the O
face O
" O
in O
time O
to O
avoid O
a O
possible O
temptation O
to O
turn O
the O
military O
into O
a O
praetorian O
force O
and O
divert O
them O
from O
their O
primary O
function O
which O
is O
to O
be O
guarantors O
of O
the O
democratic O
institutionality O

the O
Venezuelan O

for O

since O

This O
fact O
has O
caused O
significant O
social O
alarm O
among O

, O
since O
the O
circulation O
of O
this O

allows O
them O

continue O

maintain O
their O

even O
if O

For O

at O
the O
request O
of O

For O
Sanchez B-PER
Bódalo I-PER
the O
measure O
of O

is O
a O
provocation O
to O
force O
the O

to O
the O
problem O
of O

that O

make O

when O

Rafel B-PER

referred O
to O
the O
difficult O
situation O
that O

go O
through O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
finding O
someone O
to O
publish O
their O
stories O
and O
added O
that O
one O
of O
the O

goes O
through O

over O

" O
even O

, O
" O
said O
Marcos B-PER

, O
" O
you O

The O
three O

agreed O
in O
the O
appreciation O
that O
it O

if O
it O
is O
adapted O
to O
the O
world O
of O

, O
or O
vice O

, O
" O
because O
in O
most O
cases O

not O

not O

. O

He O
defended O
that O
its O

Fito B-PER
added O
that O
at O

this O

above O

added O
that O
" O
that O
is O
why O

debate O
in O

is O
not O
about O

reports O

something O

how O
to O

organized O

, O
explained O
that O
just O
as O
in O
past O
centuries O
people O
did O
not O
know O
the O
reality O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
information O
, O
nowadays O
a O
reverse O
phenomenon O
occurs O
, O
because O
the O
excess O
of O

prevents O
the O
public O
to O
select O
the O
contents O
. O

He O
also O
added O
that O
the O
configuration O
of O
most O
of O
today O
's O
media O
deprives O
its O
public O
of O
a O
critical O
sense O
, O
as O
they O
always O
transmit O
a O
" O
dominating O
and O
imperialistic O
" O
message O
, O
so O
that O
" O
it O
is O
useless O
to O
give O
an O
eccentric O
opinion O
, O
since O
that O
opinion O
will O
not O
be O
picked O
up O
by O
the O

" O
. O

Jimenez B-PER
Lozano I-PER
said O
that O
the O
media O
first O
investigate O
the O
audience O
to O
which O
they O
are O
addressed O
, O
to O
transform O
the O
message O
according O
to O
their O
audience O
, O
which O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
great O
masses O
forces O
to O
trivialize O
the O
contents O
, O
so O
that O
" O
everything O
becomes O
light O
and O
superficial O
, O
so O
that O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
think O
much O
" O
. O

The O
writer O
and O
essayist O
harshly O
criticized O
the O
presence O
of O

who O
work O
for O
the O

, O
which O
he O
said O
represent O
a O
reality O
in O
which O
" O
the O
personal O
experience O
of O
the O
public O
is O
useless O
, O
which O
deprives O
the O
critical O
sense O
and O
leads O
to O
idiocy O
" O
. O

Jimenez B-PER
Lozano I-PER
pointed O
out O
that O
with O

way O

the O

. O

The O
course O
, O
which O
was O
inaugurated O
by O
the O
Minister O
of O

, O
began O
with O
a O
lecture O
by O
Perfecto B-PER
Cuadrado I-PER
, O
professor O
of O
Portuguese B-MISC
Philology I-MISC
and O
dean O
of O
the O
Faculty B-ORG
of I-ORG

. O
He O
defended O
the O
existence O
of O
a O

movement O
in O
the O
plastic O

literary O
arts O
that O
mainly O
occupied O
the O
years O

. O

For O
Perfecto B-PER
Cuadrado I-PER
, O
the O
Portuguese O
surrealism O
of O
these O
years O
has O
not O
yet O
received O
the O
deserved O
attention O
despite O
having O
given O
rise O
to O
works O
of O
extraordinary O
richness O
, O
and O
instead O
has O
suffered O
from O
numerous O
clichés O
, O
which O
he O
flatly O
denied O
, O
such O
as O
the O
accusations O
of O
not O
having O
been O
an O
organized O
movement O
, O
of O
being O
, O
instead O
, O
a O
late O
and O
peripheral O
movement O
and O
lacking O
originality O
. O

Cuadrado B-PER
insisted O
that O
Portuguese O
surrealism O
was O
an O
organized O
movement O
that O
during O
the O
years O
1947 O
. O
1953 O
was O
present O
and O
actively O
intervened O
in O
the O
Portuguese O
cultural O
reality O
, O
he O
admitted O
that O
it O
was O
a O
late O
movement O
although O
he O
did O
not O
consider O
this O
fact O
as O
something O
negative O
. O

He O
did O
recognize O
that O
it O
was O
peripheral O
, O
but O
he O
considered O
this O
to O
be O
positive O
because O
it O
is O
in O
the O
periphery O
that O
the O
newest O
trends O
often O
emerge O
. O

As O
for O
the O
accusation O
of O
lack O
of O
originality O
, O
he O
dismissed O
this O
cliché O
and O
assured O
that O
surrealism O
that O
was O
done O
in O
Spain B-LOC
was O
not O
imitated O
from O
Portugal I-LOC
because O
it O
was O
not O
known O
at O
that O
time O
, O
while O
he O
considered O
as O
a O
characteristic O
of O
this O
Portuguese O
movement O
the O
environment O
in O
which O
it O
unfolded O
, O
the O
environment O

the O
role O
of O
the O
most O
avant O

movements O
in O
the O
rapprochement O
between O
Spain B-ORG

that O
" O
it O
was O
fundamentally O
the O

it O
was O

The O

also O
emphasized O
the O
numerous O

Jesus B-PER
Miguel I-PER

assured O
the O

that O
the O

that O
" O

After O
pointing O
out O
that O

he O
criticized O

" O

a O

ahead O

The O
PSOE B-ORG
deputy O
indicated O
that O
the O
PP B-ORG
wants O
to O
spread O
its O
nervousness O
to O
the O

so O
that O
it O
rushes O
and O
then O
perhaps O
it O
will O
have O
an O

response O
to O

He O
showed O
the O
support O

urged O

For O
Jesús B-PER
Miguel I-PER
Franco I-PER
, O
the O
PP B-ORG
thought O
that O
the O
educational O
policy O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
" O
disaster O
" O
from O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
academic O
year O
and O
that O
it O
would O
not O
be O
possible O
to O
reach O
a O
certain O
social O
peace O
in O
the O
Aragonese B-LOC
Community I-LOC

He O
stressed O
that O
the O
academic O
year O
began O
normally O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
teachers O
and O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
resources O
allocated O
to O
the O
centers O
, O
which O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
began O
to O
worry O
the O
PP B-ORG
. O

He O
also O
highlighted O
the O
personnel O
policy O
promoted O
by O
the O
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
Education I-ORG
, O
the O
main O
instrument O
of O

, O
to O
achieve O
comfortable O
templates O
and O
promote O
teacher O
stability O
. O

In O
relation O
to O
the O
university O
policy O
, O
he O
underlined O
the O
Government B-ORG
's O
proposal O
to O
promote O
the O
basic O
financing O
of O
the O
academic O
institution O
, O
after O
the O
difficulties O
of O
the O
different O

Likewise O
, O
he O
highlighted O
the O
Education B-MISC

as O
the O

He O
considered O
that O
another O
matter O
of O
concern O
for O
the O

is O
that O
" O
the O

acknowledged O
that O
" O
the O
only O
difficulty O
" O
that O
the O
current O

able O
to O
overcome O
was O
the O

over O

of O
the O
plenary O
in O
Strasbourg B-LOC
. O

The O
Fifteen B-MISC
have O
been O
applying O
since O
1998 O
a O
directive O
adopted O
two O
years O
earlier O
following O
an O
agreement O
between O
European O
employers O
and O
trade O
unions O
that O
provides O
for O
a O
minimum O
period O
of O
maternity O
leave O
of O
three O
months O
( O
12 O
weeks O
) O
, O
the O
modalities O
of O
which O
are O
regulated O
according O
to O
the O
collective O
agreement O
that O
applies O
to O
the O
worker O
. O

The O
European B-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
will O
call O
for O
a O
revision O
of O
this O
directive O
or O
the O
drafting O
of O
a O
specific O
directive O
to O
increase O
the O
protection O
of O
pregnant O
workers O
, O
to O
extend O
maternity O
leave O
to O
20 O
weeks O
, O
of O
which O
eight O
weeks O
will O
form O
a O
minimum O
rest O
period O
after O
giving O
birth O
. O

The O
directive O
should O
provide O
, O
according O
to O
the O
parliamentary O
proposal O
, O
a O
" O
more O
precise O
" O
definition O
of O
the O
benefits O
that O
women O
can O
receive O
during O
maternity O
leave O
, O
including O
the O
maintenance O
of O
" O
at O
least O
80 O
percent O
of O
the O
salary O
" O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
ban O
on O
dismissal O
of O
the O
worker O
during O
the O
entire O
period O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
should O
provide O
for O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
leave O
that O
can O
cover O
the O
entire O
period O
of O
pregnancy O
if O
there O
are O
risks O
to O
the O
health O
of O
the O
mother O
or O
the O
baby O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
directive O
would O
have O
to O
regulate O
the O
break O
periods O
during O
work O
to O
allow O
the O
worker O
who O
has O
been O
a O
mother O
to O
breastfeed O
the O
child O
and O
prohibit O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
employee O
has O
to O
cover O
a O
night O
shift O
, O
especially O
16 O
weeks O
before O
or O
after O
childbirth O
. O

If O
the O
Strasbourg B-LOC
plenary O
supports O
this O
proposal O
, O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
could O
be O
forced O
to O
use O
its O
power O
of O
legislative O
initiative O
to O
draw O
up O
a O
draft O
directive O
, O
which O
would O
be O
submitted O
to O
EU B-ORG
labor O
ministers O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
the O
European B-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
is O
to O
align O
the O
European O
rules O
for O
the O
protection O
of O
pregnant O
working O
women O
with O
those O
more O
advanced O
in O
force O
in O
some O
EU O
countries O
and O
to O
fill O
the O
gaps O
that O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
the O
implementation O
of O
the O
1996 O
directive O
, O
according O
to O
the O
paper O
prepared O
by O
the O
Portuguese O
MEP O
. O

The O
first O
attempt O
to O
harmonize O
the O
periods O
of O
maternity O
leave O
in O
the O
EU B-ORG
was O
made O
in O

that O

In O

opinion O

all O

must O
increase O

until O

there O

something O

The O
danger O
of O
a O
coup O
attempt O
will O
persist O
in O
Paraguay B-LOC

Galaverna B-PER
accompanied O
the O
President O

Republic B-ORG
, O
Luis B-PER
González I-PER
Macchi I-PER
, O
last O
Thursday O
night O
when O
military O

civilians O
loyal O

occupied O
at O

two O
military O
units O

the O
central O

The O
president O
of O
Congress B-ORG
has O
become O
one O
of O
the O
main O
critics O
of O
the O
president O
, O
whom O
he O
has O
demanded O
greater O
forcefulness O
in O

" O
The O
Government B-ORG

acting O
in O

it O
pulls O

does O
not O
cut O
branches O

trunks O

much O
less O
deals O
with O

Oviedo B-PER
" O
, O
said O
Galaverna B-PER
to O
the O
Asuncion O
radio O
station O
" O
Radio B-ORG
Cardinal I-ORG
" O
while O
complaining O
that O
there O
are O
only O
arrest O
warrants O
against O
low O
- O
ranking O
military O
and O
not O
generals O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
who O
are O
the O
generals O
who O
have O
to O
fall O
, O
Galaverna B-PER
asked O
to O
be O
allowed O
an O
attitude O
of O
cowardice O
. O

" O
Because O
- O
he O
explained O
- O
I O
'm O
sick O
of O
talking O
to O
the O
people O
I O
have O
to O
talk O
to O
about O
this O
and O
they O
tell O
me O
yes O
, O
they O
order O
the O
corresponding O
decrees O
to O
be O
drawn O
up O
and O
then O
, O
by O
art O
of O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
, O
it O
is O
reviewed O
and O
they O
do O
not O
even O
tell O
me O
water O
goes O
" O
. O

Now O
, O
in O
a O
statement O
to O
foreign O
media O
, O
Oviedo B-PER
announced O
new O
coups O
, O
" O
and O
of O
course O
there O
may O
be O
another O
coup O
( O
. O
. O
. O
) O
, O
because O
the O
institutionality O
is O
not O
entrenched O
as O
it O
should O
, O
" O
said O
the O
senator O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Galaverna B-PER
revealed O
that O
within O
the O
Armed O
Forces B-ORG
there O
is O
" O
dissent O
" O
and O
not O
precisely O
, O
nor O
exclusively O
, O
because O
of O
a O
question O
of O
adherence O
to O
" O
Oviedoism O
" O
, O
but O
because O
of O
the O
general O
situation O
of O
the O
Republic B-ORG
. O

" O
There O
are O
arrears O
in O
payments O
to O
military O
and O
police O
, O
especially O
the O
military O
, O
and O
if O
one O
has O
armed O
people O
and O
claims O
their O
loyalty O
it O
seems O
logical O
to O
me O
that O
at O
least O
they O
should O
be O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
" O
, O
stressed O
Galaverna B-PER
. O

The O
head O
of O
Congress B-ORG
, O
who O
in O
certain O
circumstances O
also O
serves O
as O
vice O
president O
of O
the O
Republic B-ORG
, O
complained O
about O
the O
" O
lack O
of O
temperament O
" O
of O
the O
Executive B-ORG
, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
him O
, O
does O
not O
make O
sufficient O
effort O
to O
arrest O
Oviedo B-PER
. O

These O
criticisms O
have O
created O
a O
confrontation O
between O
the O
Legislative B-MISC

the O
Executive B-MISC
, O
whose O
legal O
and O
political O
advisor O
, O
Agustín B-PER

, O
today O
accused O
Galaverna B-PER
of O
trying O
to O
displace O
González B-PER
Macchi I-PER
from O
power O
. O

To O
that O
end O
, O
he O
encourages O
" O
the O
perverse O
intention O
of O
making O
the O
president O
appear O
as O
a O
timorous O
, O
a O
weak O
man O
who O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
lead O
the O
destiny O
of O
the O
country O
, O
" O
said O
the O
advisor O

González B-PER
Insfrán I-PER
denied O
that O
the O
" O
presidential O
environment O
" O
is O
acting O
in O

hindering O
the O

when O
he O
renounced O

On O

that O
he O

Paraguayan O
territory O
, O
protected O
by O
his O
followers O
in O

On O
this O
occasion O
Oviedo B-PER
assured O
that O
he O
did O
not O
participate O
in O
the O
uprising O
of O
last O
Thursday O
, O
but O
the O
authorities O
affirm O
that O
the O
indications O
point O
to O
him O
, O
starting O
with O
the O

" O
The O

opinion O
is O
that O

this O
that O

the O

The O
victim O
, O
aged O
30 O
, O
was O
found O
by O
her O
boyfriend O
last O
Friday O
in O
the O
house O

shared O
in O

Ramon I-LOC

in O
the O

, O
with O
a O

in O
the O

, O
after O
the O
two O
held O
a O
fierce O
argument O
in O
the O
living O
room O
of O
the O
house O
. O

After O
the O
dispute O
, O
the O
policeman O
urged O
the O
victim O
to O
collect O
her O
things O
and O
leave O
the O
house O
and O
she O
went O
into O
the O
bedroom O
and O
while O
she O
was O
packing O
her O
bags O
she O
saw O
the O
gun O
, O
with O
which O
, O
allegedly O
, O
the O
shot O
was O
fired O
, O
as O
determined O
so O
far O
by O
investigators O
. O

The O
same O
sources O
said O
that O
in O
the O
police O
officer O

service O
weapon O
, O
with O
which O
the O
shot O
was O
fired O
, O
no O
prints O
of O
either O
of O
the O
two O
have O
been O
found O
and O
noted O
that O
it O
is O
easy O
that O
these O
are O
not O
printed O
on O
the O
butt O
of O
the O
gun O
because O
it O
is O
rubber O
. O

Regarding O
the O
trajectory O
of O
the O
projectile O
, O
they O
commented O
that O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
kill O
a O
person O
by O
forcing O
him O
to O
be O
shot O
with O
the O
gun O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
skin O
. O

In O

, O
they O
estimated O
that O
if O
the O
girl O
's O
boyfriend O
had O
tried O
to O
force O
her O
to O
shoot O
herself O
, O
signs O
of O
injuries O
caused O
by O
her O
resistance O
would O
have O
been O
found O
on O
the O

at O

on O
her O

" O
there O

structural O

and O
that O
we O

not O
wait O
for O
the O

the O

for O
it O
to O
be O

out O
that O
it O
is O
in O
the O

the O

" O

reducing O

to O
reduce O
the O

the O

for O

out O

it O

so O
the O
commission O
chose O
to O
suggest O
that O

reducing O

an O

in O
the O

F. B-PER
R. I-PER
J. I-PER
has O
also O
been O
sentenced O
to O
compensate O
the O
injured O
parties O
in O
more O
than O
70 O
million O
pesetas O
, O
an O
amount O
that O
will O
be O
increased O
when O
the O
litigation O
that O
some O
of O

them O
credits O

the O

. O

The O
sentence O
, O
to O
which O
Efe B-ORG
had O
access O
, O
recounts O
up O
to O
twelve O
operations O
that O
the O
defendant O
signed O
with O
different O
people O
. O

In O
one O
of O
them O
, O
the O
defendant O
, O
according O
to O
the O
court O
, O
acquired O
a O
vehicle O
and O
a O
license O
and O
subsequently O
sold O
it O
to O
two O
different O
people O
, O
one O
of O
whom O
paid O
him O
more O
than O
eight O
million O
pesetas O
without O
receiving O
anything O
in O

. O

The O
acts O
of O
the O
accused O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Audiencia B-ORG
, O
evidence O
that O
" O
the O
fraudulent O
intent O
was O
present O
at O
the O
signing O
of O
the O
contracts O
, O
since O
he O
did O
not O
make O
any O
of O

benefits O
to O
which O
he O
was O
obliged O
or O
only O
did O
so O
in O
a O
minimal O
part O
" O
. O

Thus O
the O
resolution O
explains O
that O
, O
in O
certain O
cases O
, O
he O
gave O
small O
sums O
of O
money O
to O
acquire O
the O
licenses O
that O
he O
subsequently O
sold O
, O
and O
pocketed O
the O
price O
of O
the O
sale O
and O
did O
not O
pay O
the O
owner O
the O
agreed O
sum O
. O

" O
Most O
of O
the O
injured O
parties O
were O
people O
who O
either O
sold O
their O
vehicles O
and O
licenses O
because O
they O
could O
not O
meet O
the O
credits O
requested O
at O
the O
time O
to O
acquire O
them O
, O
or O
contracted O
loans O
for O
very O

facilitate O
the O
escape O
, O
in O
case O
of O
being O
caught O
. O

The O
stolen O
garments O
were O
placed O
in O
a O
bag O
, O
handmade O
with O
three O
layers O
, O
one O
of O
them O
covered O
with O
aluminum O
foil O
to O
avoid O
the O
magnetic O
security O
systems O
of O
the O
store O
. O

Once O
they O
stole O
and O
put O
the O
garments O
in O
the O
bag O
, O
the O
couple O
separated O
to O
leave O
through O
different O
doors O
and O
distract O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
guards O
in O
case O

with O
the O

of O
the O

, O
which O
was O
on O
the O

This O
mode O
of O
operation O
was O
detected O
in O
an O
establishment O
in O
Murcia B-LOC
where O
they O
seized O
a O
mink O
coat O
, O
valued O
at O
950,000 O
pesetas O
, O
which O
they O
took O
taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
garment O
did O
not O
have O
the O
security O
system O
because O
the O
woman O
had O
tried O
it O
on O
. O

The O
detainees O
put O
the O
coat O
in O
the O
bag O
, O
managed O
to O
distract O
the O
sales O
clerk O
and O
fled O
with O
the O
" O
merchandise O
" O
. O

After O
police O
investigations O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
the O
three O
individuals O
had O
acted O
in O
Alicante B-LOC
, O
where O
they O
tried O
to O
take O
nine O
polo O
shirts O
, O
valued O
at O
126,000 O
pesetas O
, O
but O
were O
surprised O
by O
a O
watchman O
whom O
they O
pushed O
and O
fled O
, O
abandoning O
the O
garments O
in O
his O
career O
. O

However O
, O
the O
trio O
tried O
again O
to O
act O
in O
Murcia B-LOC
but O
were O
arrested O
when O
one O
of O
them O
was O
carrying O
the O
described O
bag O
hidden O
in O
the O
crotch O
, O
and O
the O
girl O
, O
gardening O
scissors O
to O
break O
the O
magnetic O
tags O
as O
well O
as O
a O
cell O
phone O
each O
of O
them O
. O

The O
woman O
has O
been O
arrested O
eleven O
times O
for O
theft O
and O
other O
crimes O
against O
property O
, O
and O
his O

The O

out O
today O
that O
the O

it O

that O
the O
regional O
administration B-ORG
will O
propose O
a O
pact O
to O
the O
health O
professionals O
of O
Extremadura B-LOC
" O
which O
will O
implicitly O
carry O
the O
need O

Fernández B-PER
Vara I-PER
participated O
today O
in O
Plasencia B-LOC
in O
a O
conference O
organized O
by O
the O
health O
group O
of O
the O
Local B-ORG
Group I-ORG
of O
the O
PSOE B-ORG
, O
which O
was O
attended O
by O
fifty O
people O
, O
in O
order O
to O
discuss O
the O
health O
project O
for O
Extremadura B-LOC
developed O
by O
this O
socialist O
group O
. O

The O
Extremaduran O
counselor O
indicated O
that O
health O
professionals O
are O
a O
key O
piece O
in O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
Health B-MISC
Model I-MISC
of I-MISC
Extremadura I-MISC
" O
and O
therefore O
- O
he O
said O
- O
we O
are O
going O
to O
pact O
with O
them O
, O
being O
clear O
that O
pacting O
means O
negotiating O
objectives O
, O
especially O
because O
a O
Hospital O
can O
not O
work O
eight O
. O
three O
as O
they O
are O
doing O
now O
" O
. O

" O
Because O
otherwise O
, O
he O
added O
, O
everyone O
should O
be O
at O
eight O
o'clock O
in O
perfect O
condition O
, O
and O
they O
are O
not O
, O
and O
certainly O
I O
will O
not O
go O
behind O
with O
a O
list O
seeing O
what O
time O
people O
arrive O
because O
I O
think O
that O
model O
has O
failed O
miserably O
" O
. O

He O
assured O
that O
the O
ultimate O
aim O
of O
this O
pact O
is O
that O
the O
professionals O
take O
responsibility O
for O
specific O
objectives O
" O
and O
then O
we O
will O
not O
care O
if O
they O
meet O
them O
in O
seven O
or O
eight O
hours O
" O
and O
that O
the O
division O
between O
management O
and O
the O
clinic O
is O
broken O
" O
not O
like O
now O
that O
it O
seems O
that O
management O
is O
the O
responsibility O
of O
some O
and O
the O
assistance O
of O
others O
" O
. O

Fernandez B-PER
Vara I-PER
asserted O
that O
in O
the O
Health B-MISC
Model I-MISC
of I-MISC
Extremadura I-MISC
should O
prioritize O
competition O
and O
not O
competitiveness O
, O
" O
because O
- O
he O
said O
- O
public O
health O
should O
not O
compete O
with O
anyone O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
in O
order O
to O
be O
competitive O
and O
for O
people O
not O
to O
leave O
for O
private O
healthcare O
" O
we O
have O
to O
give O
not O
only O
a O
better O
treatment O
to O
diseases O
but O
also O
a O
better O
treatment O
to O
people O
" O
. O

The O
Minister O
said O
that O
if O
all O
the O
social O
agents O
are O
able O
to O
design O
a O
model O
" O
which O
may O
not O
be O
the O
one O
we O
would O
all O
like O
individually O
, O
but O
which O
we O
understand O
to O
be O
the O
least O
bad O
or O
the O
best O
, O
this O
will O
be O
a O
good O
starting O
point O
" O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
he O
indicated O
that O
the O
political O
leaders O
have O
the O
obligation O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
people O
with O
clarity O
" O
making O
clear O
that O
many O
things O
can O
be O
done O
but O
that O
neither O
everything O
can O
be O
done O
, O
nor O
everything O
at O
the O
same O
time O

Comment O
: O
The O
Spanish O
volleyball O
team O
complicated O
today O
its O
qualification O
for O
the O
2001 O
European B-MISC
Championship I-MISC
by O
losing O
3 O
- O
0 O
to O
Slovakia B-ORG
, O
in O
a O
match O
in O
which O
the O
host O
country O
came O
out O
on O
top O
of O
the O
group O
after O
winning O
all O
three O
matches O
it O
has O
played O
. O

The O
national O
team O
played O
a O
bad O
match O
, O
despite O
having O
carried O
out O
several O
changes O
during O
the O
game O
time O
and O
having O
put O
on O
the O
court O
all O
their O
available O
players O
. O

In O
the O
first O
set O
, O
Spain B-LOC
was O
very O
weak O
in O
the O
reception O
and O
was O
overcome O
at O
all O
times O
by O
a O
Slovakia B-ORG
that O
showed O
its O
quality O
on O
the O
court O
and O
gave O
a O
great O
lesson O
in O
blocking O
the O
Spanish O
players O
. O

In O
the O
match O
, O
the O
Slovakian O
team O
came O
to O
score O
five O
direct O
points O
of O
serve O
, O
through O
his O
player O
Kravaric B-PER
, O
which O
made O
it O
impossible O
to O
dream O
of O
a O
comeback O
by O
the O
Spanish O
team O
and O
was O
sublime O
in O
attack O
, O
thus O
undermining O
the O
aspirations O
of O
the O
national O
team O
. O

The O
second O
set O
, O
which O
ended O
with O
a O
25 O
- O
23 O
on O
the O
scoreboard O
, O
was O
more O
equal O
because O
Spain B-ORG
improved O
significantly O
in O
their O
reception O
. O

The O
departure O
of O
De B-PER
la I-PER
Fuente I-PER
to O
the O
court O
was O
an O
important O
point O
, O
as O
it O
returned O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
the O
lost O
concentration O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Spanish O
team O
remained O
very O
irregular O
and O
wasted O
a O
lot O
of O
balls O
that O
they O
threw O
out O
of O
the O
court O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
another O
of O
the O
black O
points O
of O
the O
national O
team O
was O
in O
the O
blocking O
, O
where O
only O
managed O
to O
make O
two O
against O
the O
eleven O
of O
the O
Slovak O
team O
. O

In O
the O
third O
set O
, O
which O
followed O
the O
same O
line O
of O
errors O
as O
the O
previous O
two O
, O
highlighted O
the O
presence O
on O
the O
court O
of O
Guillermo B-PER
Falazca I-PER
, O
who O
came O
out O
in O
place O
of O
Pascual B-PER
, O
and O
the O
good O
play O
of O
Moltó B-PER

Ernaesto B-PER
Rodriguez I-PER
, O
who O
were O
the O
best O
players O
of O
the O
Spanish O
team O
during O
the O
match O
. O

Despite O
the O
multiple O
changes O
carried O
out O
in O
the O
selection O
, O
the O
Slovak O
team O
was O
superior O
and O
thus O
placed O
in O
an O
enviable O
position O
in O
the O

to O
police O
sources O
, O
the O
woman O
arrested O
, O
of O
Latin O
American O
nationality O
, O
was O
allegedly O
dedicated O
to O
receive O
their O

and O
the O
other O
five O
men O
in O
the O
Alicante O
towns O
of O
Calpe B-LOC

Benissa B-LOC

Apparently O
, O
one O
of O
them O
was O
the O
intermediary O
who O
was O
responsible O
for O
locating O
employers O
who O
were O
interested O
in O
immigrants O
, O
while O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
men O
are O
construction O
businessmen O
who O
allegedly O
offered O
work O
to O
South O
Americans O
arriving O
in O
Spain B-LOC

The O
investigations O
, O
which O
began O
in O
mid O
- O
March O
, O
point O
out O
that O
the O
organization O
promised O
them O
a O
job O
in O
construction O
and O
, O
for O
this O
, O
provided O
them O
with O
airline O
tickets O
, O
a O
" O
fake O
" O
letter O
- O
invitation O
and O
some O
cell O
phone O
numbers O
of O
a O
compatriot O
with O
whom O
they O
would O
contact O
once O
they O
had O
arrived O
in O
Valencia B-LOC
. O

For O
these O
services O
, O
the O
immigrants O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
organization O
some O
230,000 O
pesetas O
which O
, O
in O
most O
cases O
, O
were O
obtained O
by O
applying O
for O
user O
loans O
. O

For O
a O
few O
days O
, O
these O
immigrants O
were O
housed O
in O
this O
capital O
and O
, O
later O
, O
they O
contacted O
another O
compatriot O
who O
mediated O
with O
the O
builders O
to O
find O
them O
the O
promised O
employment O
, O
while O
providing O
them O
with O
new O
accommodation O
. O

For O
these O
efforts O
, O
the O
dismantled O
network O
allegedly O
demanded O
an O
amount O
ranging O
from O
three O
hundred O
to O
five O

these O

not O

it O

One O
of O
the O
shortcomings O
in O
the O

between O

the O
EU B-ORG
is O
precisely O
the O
low O

of O

grown O
in O
areas O
previously O
dedicated O
to O

. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
the O

Elza B-PER

, O
who O
represented O
the O
Portuguese O

said O
that O
when O

the O
EU O
countries O
will O
favor O
the O
entry O
into O

Pais B-PER
assured O
that O
" O
it O
would O
not O
make O
sense O
for O
the O
EU B-ORG
to O
finance O
alternative O
crops O
to O

" O
and O
then O
prevent O
the O
entry O
of O
these O

that O
the O
situation O
of O
the O

is O
a O
social O
and O
market O
problem O
. O

The O
Bolivian B-ORG
representative O
defended O
the O
close O
collaboration O
of O
Latin O
American O
growers O

European O
businessmen O
. O

After O
pointing O
out O
that O
this O
is O
the O
best O
way O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O

, O
Medinacelli B-PER
explained O
that O
alternative O
crops O
to O

, O
such O
as O

, O
are O
raw O
materials O
of O
high O
consumption O
in O
Europe B-LOC

Pais B-PER
recalled O
that O
the O
EU B-ORG
has O
allocated O
35 O
million O
Euros O
to O
support O
the O
fight O
against O
drugs O
in O
Latin O
American O
and O
Caribbean O
countries O
for O
the O
period O
1997 O

2001 O
, O
a O
large O
part O
of O
these O
resources O
for O
the O

The O
EU B-ORG
ratified O
its O
support O
to O
the O

as O
well O
as O

He O
explained O
that O
the O
alarming O
phenomenon O
of O
the O
transformation O
of O

so O
the O

part O

the O

" O
Fortunately O
- O
according O
to O
Castellano B-PER
- O
everything O
has O
remained O
a O
scare O
, O
because O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
collapse O
, O
about O
eight O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
there O
were O
four O
novices O
in O
the O
room O
cleaning O
the O
moisture O
that O
had O
accumulated O
in O
the O
area O
. O

Possibly O
the O
humidity O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
collapse O
and O
the O
fall O
of O
three O
of O
these O
novices O
, O
" O
Castellano B-PER
explained O
to O

The O
three O
novices O
fell O
from O
a O
height O
of O
approximately O
three O
meters O
, O
being O
only O
slightly O
bruised O
in O
one O
leg O
one O
of O
them O
, O
which O
has O
already O
been O
treated O
by O
an O

who O
moved O

the O
three O
injuries O
were O
treated O
at O
the O
scene O
, O
without O
any O
of O
them O
needed O
to O
be O
transferred O
to O
a O
health O
center O
. O

The O
fourth O
novice O
, O
who O
remained O
on O
the O
top O
floor O
without O
falling O
, O
had O
to O
be O
rescued O
by O
firefighters O
from O
the O
room O
in O
which O
she O
was O
. O

" O
The O
truth O
is O
that O
this O
convent O
has O
been O
calling O
for O
a O
complete O
restoration O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
nothing O
has O
been O
done O

Any O
day O
we O
are O
going O
to O
fall O
the O
whole O

and O
we O
will O
regret O
it O
