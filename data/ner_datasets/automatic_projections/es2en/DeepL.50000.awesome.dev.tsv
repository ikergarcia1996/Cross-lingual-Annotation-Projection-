the O

followed O
with O

those O
of O
Castaño B-PER
, O
for O
his O
delivery O

, O
for O
the O
concept O
of O

he O
practices O

curvilinear O

for O
that O

, O
where O
it O
seems O
that O
it O
is O

Everything O
in O
Castaño B-PER

why O

The O

was O
fundamentally O
very O

Very O
crossed O

throwing O
the O

forward O
, O
Castaño B-PER
ran O
his O
hand O
very O
firmly O
to O

the O
long O

Thus O
several O
times O

pulling O
the O

, O
tempering O

linking O
the O

were O
the O

It O
was O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
sword O
went O
to O
the O
basement O
, O
because O
it O
would O
have O
cut O
an O
ear O
deservedly O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
triumph O
was O
not O
long O
in O
the O
next O
. O

Castaño B-PER
came O
out O
again O
with O
the O
cape O
. O

And O
the O
muleta O
was O
intense O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
. O

This O
time O
he O
surpassed O
his O
own O
frontier O
, O
placing O
himself O
even O
further O
from O
the O
engaño O
. O

The O
space O
through O
which O
the O
bull O
had O
to O
pass O
was O
unbelievable O
. O

But O
, O
to O
the O
astonishment O
of O

audience O
, O
it O
ended O
up O
passing O

And O
Castaño B-PER

Castaño B-PER

to O
all O
this O

did O

forward O

bringing O
him O
hooked O

passing O
him O
as O

taking O
him O
away O

that O

for O

" O
the O

Boehm B-PER
explained O
how O

that O

that O

After O
recalling O

the O

compared O
to O
its O

Egibar B-PER
pointed O
out O
, O
however O
, O
that O
" O

" O
we O
know O
that O
they O
have O
set O
two O
conditions O
for O

be O
set O
up O

that O
the O
current O

be O
accepted O

that O

be O
condemned O
" O
. O

For O
Otegi B-PER
, O
" O
if O
we O
are O
going O
to O
create O
a O

so O
that O
we O
all O
get O
together O
to O
say O
that O
the O

this O

According O
to O
the O

the O

Cardenas B-PER

to O

For O

' O

, O
the O
fact O
that O

be O

which O
will O

filed O
by O
half O
a O
million O

in O
the O
state O

is O
taking O
place O
. O

According O
to O
the O
lawyer O
, O
it O
is O
" O
unrealistic O
" O
to O
think O
that O
tobacco O
companies O
can O
pay O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
in O
compensation O
to O
smokers O
and O
in O
the O
specific O
case O
of O
the O
firm O
he O

he O
said O
that O

36 O

found O

three O
Florida B-LOC

, O
and O
awarded O
them O
$ O
12.6 O

The O
verdict O
left O
the O
door O
open O

the O
rest O
of O
the O
half O
million O
smokers O
plaintiffs O
to O
be O
heard O
in O
court O
and O
obtain O
compensation O
that O
the O
tobacco O
companies O
fear O
will O
amount O
to O
some O
300 O
billion O
dollars O
. O

The O
same O
jury O
ruled O
in O
1999 O
that O
the O
tobacco O
companies O
were O
responsible O
for O
cigarette O
- O
related O
diseases O
by O
manufacturing O
a O
defective O
product O
that O
causes O
emphysema O
and O
lung O
cancer O
, O
among O
other O
illnesses O
. O

According O
to O
analysts O
, O
the O
jury O
's O
ruling O
could O
lead O
the O
U.S. O
tobacco O
industry O
to O
declare O
bankruptcy O
when O
faced O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
having O
to O
pay O
similar O
compensations O
. O

Fearing O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
trial O
, O
Florida B-LOC
lawmakers O
recently O
unanimously O
approved O
a O
law O
that O
will O
protect O
a O
settlement O
with O
the O
industry O
for O
about O
$ O
11.3 O
billion O
in O
medical O
costs O
the O
state O
incurred O
in O
treating O
sick O
smokers O
. O

Part O
of O
the O
resources O
, O
which O
have O
been O
increased O
to O
13,000 O
million O
dollars O
, O
have O
been O
destined O
to O
programs O
for O
children O
and O
the O

. O

The O
law O
establishes O
a O
limit O
of O
100 O
million O
dollars O
to O
the O
bond O
that O
tobacco O
companies O
must O
pay O
before O

The O

a O
new O
increase O
in O

applied O

( O

for O
250 O

at O

The O
rate O
agreed O
for O
the O
placement O
of O
these O

was O
8.68 O
percent O
, O
as O

The O
authorities O

that O
the O

The O

so O
far O
in O
the O
Feria B-MISC
de I-MISC
San I-MISC
Isidro I-MISC
for O
an O
important O
performance O
today O
, O
told O
Efe B-ORG
at O

end O

that O
he O
felt O
" O
a O
privileged O
to O
have O
achieved O
the O
Puerta B-MISC
Grande I-MISC
, O
the O
most O
sought O
after O
in O
bullfighting O
. O

The O
young O
bullfighter O
explained O
to O
his O
family O
once O
at O
the O
hotel O
how O
he O
was O
overcome O
with O
emotion O
when O
he O
crossed O
the O
Puerta B-MISC
Grande I-MISC
, O
" O
so O
much O
so O
that O
when O
I O
left O
I O
did O
n't O
see O
the O
van O
and O
took O
a O
cab O
. O

But O
I O
have O
savored O
the O
exit O
on O
shoulders O
, O
it O
was O
very O
nice O
as O
everyone O
touched O
me O
. O

In O
those O
moments O
I O
thought O
a O
lot O
that O
I O
had O
finally O
realized O
my O
childhood O
dream O
that O
I O
always O
pursued O
. O

It O
has O
been O
an O
honor O
, O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
. O

Analyzing O
his O
performance O
as O
a O
whole O
, O
the O
Salamanca O
lamented O
his O
poor O
handling O
of O
the O
steels O
in O
his O
first O
. O

" O
A O
pity O
because O
the O
sword O
went O
very O
low O
and O
it O
was O
not O
my O
intention O
. O

The O
people O
have O
behaved O
phenomenally O
and O
the O
proof O
has O
been O
the O
return O
to O
the O
ring O
so O
affectionate O
after O
losing O
the O
ear O
. O

That O
steer O
had O
quality O
on O
the O
left O
side O
, O
although O
I O
had O
to O
fight O
it O
very O
well O
and O
I O
was O
determined O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

But O
the O
big O
came O
in O
the O
sixth O
, O
which O
he O
cut O
the O
two O
ears O
with O
total O
unanimity O
. O

" O
It O
was O
an O
extraordinary O
bull O
, O
with O
a O
good O
class O
and O
we O
must O
congratulate O
the O
breeder O
, O
Cesar B-PER
Rincon I-PER
. O

The O
animal O
asked O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
temper O
and O
I O
gave O
it O
to O
him O
and O
I O
was O
very O
, O
very O
comfortable O
. O

It O
was O
impressive O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

Javier B-PER
Castaño I-PER
wanted O
to O
dedicate O
this O
triumph O
to O
himself O
, O
" O
for O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
I O
have O
been O
fighting O
for O
this O
recognition O
so O
strong O
today O
in O
Madrid B-LOC

Really O
, O
I O
do O
not O
change O
me O
for O
anyone O

Even O
when O
asked O
if O
he O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
occupy O
the O
low O
of O
Sergio B-PER
Aguilar I-PER
in O
the O
next O
novillada O
, O
he O
replied O
with O
the O
serious O
gesture O
that O
characterizes O
him O
but O
with O
rotundity O
and O
immediacy O
: O
" O
Of O

I O
would O
return O

I O
would O

. O

Less O
happy O

the O

, O
Victor B-PER

Serna I-PER
, O
rather O
" O
disgusted O
. O

The O
afternoon O
was O
complicated O
, O
because O
in O
my O
first O
I O
found O
myself O
well O
, O
centered O
on O
the O
right O
side O
, O
although O
with O
the O
defect O
that O
the O
animal O
punteaba O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
muletazo O
. O

I O
switched O
to O
the O
left O
side O
and O
at O
the O
second O
muletazo O
I O
stumbled O
and O
the O
whole O
task O
fell O
apart O
. O

The O
other O
was O
a O
manso O
that O
was O
left O
without O
stinging O
, O
bronco O
and O
I O
think O
it O
was O
the O
black O
chickpea O
of O

. O

No O
class O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
along O
with O
him O
either O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

The O
most O
disappointed O
was O
the O
Frenchman O
Sebastian B-PER

barely O
had O

Bustamante B-PER
said O
it O
is O

depends O
on O

or O
Congress B-ORG
, O

The O

opposition O
presidential O
candidate O
, O
Alejandro B-PER
Toledo I-PER
, O
last O
week O
, O
but O
his O
request O
, O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
is O
no O
time O
left O
to O
correct O
the O
irregularities O
recorded O
in O
the O

since O
the O

, O
was O
rejected O
by O
the O

body O

Toledo B-PER
communicated O
last O

to O

that O
he O
will O
not O

next O
Sunday O
. O

All O
the O
national O

electoral O

missions O
acting O
in O

have O
proposed O
in O
their O
reports O
the O
postponement O
of O
the O

for O
the O
same O
reasons O
and O
for O
considering O
that O
the O
second O
round O
does O
not O
comply O
with O
the O
minimum O
conditions O
to O
be O
considered O
clean O
, O
fair O
and O
democratic O
. O

Bustamante B-PER
said O
today O
in O
statements O
to O
the O
press O
that O
the O
National B-ORG
Jury I-ORG
of I-ORG

has O
already O
ruled O
on O
the O
matter O
and O
rejected O
Toledo B-PER
's O
request O
for O
a O
postponement O
. O

He O
commented O
, O
however O
, O
that O
it O
is O
" O
a O
possibility O
" O
that O
the O
JNE B-ORG
may O
change O
its O
ruling O
. O

The O
prime O
minister O
ruled O
out O
that O
a O
" O
political O
solution O
" O
to O
the O
problem O
that O
, O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
analysts O
, O
has O
triggered O
a O
crisis O
in O
Peru B-LOC
. O

" O
A O
political O
way O
out O
must O
always O
be O
given O
within O
the O
context O
of O
the O
applicable O
regulations O
. O

In O
this O
case O
we O
have O
article O
111 O
of O
the O
Constitution B-MISC
that O
clearly O
speaks O
of O
30 O
days O
after O
the O
delivery O
of O
the O
elections O
and O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
since O
this O
article O
111 O
is O
within O
the O
chapter O
of O
the O
Executive B-MISC
Power I-MISC
it O
can O
not O
be O
interpreted O
as O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
do O
, O
" O
he O
argued O
. O

According O
to O
Bustamante B-PER
's O
interpretation O
, O
which O
has O
been O
the O
criterion O
applied O
by O
the O
JNE B-ORG
, O
the O
official O
result O
of O
the O
presidential O
vote O
that O
took O
place O
at O
the O
end O
of O
last O
month O
constituted O
the O
end O
of O
the O
electoral O
process O
in O
that O
aspect O
. O

The O
electoral O
law O
establishes O
that O
the O
second O
round O
for O
the O
presidency O
of O
the O
country O
, O
when O
none O
of O
the O
candidates O
has O
obtained O
half O
plus O
one O
of O
the O
votes O
, O
must O
be O
held O
within O
30 O
days O
after O
the O
proclamation O
of O
the O
official O
results O
. O

The O
other O
interpretation O
of O
the O
law O
, O
which O
was O
the O
argument O
presented O
by O
Toledo B-PER
to O
the O
JNE B-ORG
to O
request O
the O
postponement O
, O
considers O
that O
the O
general O
election O
process O
- O
presidential O
and O
legislative O
- O
is O
one O
and O
ends O
only O
when O
the O
total O
results O
are O
given O
, O
for O
the O
presidency O
and O
Congress B-ORG
, O
which O
, O
he O
said O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
occurred O
. O

Bustamante B-PER
reiterated O
that O
this O
argument O
is O
not O
valid O
and O
that O
the O
term O
should O
be O
counted O
from O
the O
date O
on O
which O
the O
results O
of O
the O
presidential O
count O
were O
delivered O
. O

the O

of O
the O
' O

off O

because O
the O

vanished O
by O

Madrid B-ORG
will O
play O
the O

against O

with O
the O
tranquility O
of O
knowing O
that O
, O
at O

, O

already O
secured O
a O
place O
in O
the O
next O
Euroleague B-MISC

However O
, O
it O
will O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
forget O
the O
fifth O

of O
this O
tachycardic O

was O

Suddenly O

from O

César B-PER
Arranz I-PER
, O
who O
has O
barely O
stepped O
on O
the O

this O

the O

took O
a O
turn O

entered O
the O

stopped O
the O

which O
began O
to O
fit O
three O

and O
lose O
margin O
on O
the O

. O

When O
he O
wanted O
to O
realize O
, O
Estudiantes B-ORG
was O
back O
in O
the O
gap O
( O
59 O
- O
59 O
m.35 O
) O
. O

Fortunately O
for O
the O
madridistas O
, O
the O
collegiate O
defense O
erred O
on O
a O
key O
play O
that O
allowed O
Alberto B-PER
Angulo I-PER
to O
shoot O
from O
6.25 O
( O
69 O
- O

) O
. O

That O

Madrid B-ORG
from O
the O
burning O
and O
condemned O
the O

of O

Two O

of O

With O
only O
five O

he O
threw O
himself O
on O
the O

and O
drew O
the O
foul O
. O

He O
missed O
the O
first O
shot O
, O
but O
made O
the O
second O
. O

The O
agony O
was O
palpable O
everywhere O
and O
Juan B-PER
Aisa I-PER
started O
the O
race O
to O
Madrid B-ORG
's O
basket O
. O

He O
dribbled O
past O
three O
men O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
court O
, O
went O
in O
from O
the O
wing O
and O
, O
when O
no O
one O
expected O
it O
, O
took O
a O
pass O
that O
left O
Thompson B-PER
alone O
under O
the O
hoop O
. O

The O
American O
could O
have O
even O
slammed O
it O
home O
, O
but O
he O
left O
a O
hasty O
layup O
and O
the O
ball O
went O
out O
of O
bounds O
. O

It O
was O
the O
finishing O

NO O
RESULTO O
After O
the O
apotheosis O
of O
Sunday O
in O
this O
same O
square O
and O
given O
the O
category O
of O
the O
poster O
, O
everything O
seemed O
to O
indicate O
that O
the O
afternoon O
was O
also O
going O
to O
run O
along O
good O
lines O
. O

But O
it O
was O
not O
so O
for O
the O
bullfighters O
on O
foot O
. O

Neither O
" O
Antoñete B-PER
" O
nor O
Curro B-PER
found O
moments O
of O
inspiration O
except O
for O
some O
passages O
by O
the O
genius O
that O
brought O
out O
the O
bulls O
of O
Arjona B-PER
. O

Thus O
the O
only O
trophy O
went O
to O
the O
rejoneador O
Pablo B-PER
Hermoso I-PER
de I-PER
Mendoza I-PER
who O
had O
moments O
of O
brilliance O
in O
his O
two O
bulls O
, O
although O
he O
nailed O
more O
ceretro O
in O
his O
second O
, O
a O
meek O
and O
aquerenciado O
in O
tables O
, O
with O
which O
exposed O

" O

This O
time O
also O
killed O
the O
first O
time O
hence O
the O
ear O
. O

" O
Antoñete B-PER
" O
had O
a O
good O
first O
bull O
, O
which O
he O
received O
with O
a O
bouquet O
of O
good O
veronicas O
and O
then O
highlighted O
two O
series O
, O
one O
by O
the O
right O
and O
another O
natural O
of O
great O
quality O
and O
plasticity O
. O

However O
, O
the O
possible O
trophy O
did O
not O
come O
because O
of O
his O
bad O
use O
of O
the O
sword O
. O

The O
fifth O
one O
brought O
out O
more O
genius O
and O
caste O
and O
he O
did O
not O
find O
the O
right O
coupling O
. O

He O
also O
injured O
his O
wrist O
when O
he O
entered O
to O
kill O
and O
went O
through O
an O
ordeal O
to O
finish O
the O
bull O
. O

Also O
in O
the O
greeting O
to O
his O
first O
, O
Curro B-PER
Romero I-PER
stood O
out O
for O
his O
looseness O
of O
arms O
and O
mastery O
to O
interpret O
the O
bullfighting O
to O
the O
veronica O
. O

But O
that O
was O
all O
, O
because O
the O
genius O
of O
his O
opponent O
made O
him O
abbreviate O
without O
further O
ado O
. O

Something O
similar O
in O
front O
of O
his O
second O
, O
which O
received O
a O
harsh O
punishment O
in O
varas O
. O

He O
tried O
, O
but O
again O
without O
structuring O
the O
task O
to O
see O
that O
his O
bull O
was O
not O
appropriate O
for O
the O

, O
he O

the O
negative O

that O

due O

the O

a O

not O
that O

not O

important O

allow O

to O
vary O

Although O
some O
analysts O
believe O
that O
the O
fact O
that O
the O

showing O
very O
low O

should O
alleviate O
some O
of O
the O
fears O
of O

( O
as O
it O
is O
believed O
that O
the O
lows O
of O
the O
last O

are O
not O
too O
representative O
) O
, O
others O
believe O
that O
in O
any O
case O
, O
the O
market O
will O
continue O
to O
move O
in O
the O
same O
direction O
. O
Others O
believe O
that O
in O
any O
case O
, O
with O
high O
or O
low O
trading O
volume O
, O
declines O
of O
today O

which O

who O
, O
curiously O
, O
in O
what O
may O
have O
been O
his O
last O
game O
as O
an O
Inter O
player O
, O
has O

has O
stopped O

But O
today O
Roberto B-PER

has O
taken O
his O
particular O
revenge O
, O
demonstrating O
that O
in O
a O

where O
physicality O

genius O
and O
technique O
predominate O
, O
when O
they O
decide O
to O
put O
him O
on O
the O
field O
, O
he O
is O
almost O
always O
decisive O
. O

He O
did O
it O
with O
an O
unbalancing O
performance O
and O
with O
two O
goals O
worthy O
of O
his O
quality O
: O
the O
first O
( O
36th O
minute O
) O
, O
from O
a O
direct O
free O

, O
placing O
the O

that O
everyone O

with O
an O
excellent O

with O
his O

, O

theoretically O

From O
the O

gave O
order O

However O
, O
the O

a O

Now O
it O
was O

the O

when O
Stanic B-PER
