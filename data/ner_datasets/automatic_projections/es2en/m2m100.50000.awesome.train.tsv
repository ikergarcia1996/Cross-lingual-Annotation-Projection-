today O
the O
need O
to O
take O
steps O
to O
protect O
the O

from O
a O

that O

impossible O
. O

The O

General I-PER
’s O
request O
comes O
after O

Supreme B-ORG

of O
the O

Victoria B-LOC
( O

was O
forced O

argument O
that O
the O

who O
composed O
it O
could O
have O
obtained O
information O
about O
the O
accused O
through O
the O
CrimeNet B-MISC

no O

that O

noted O
that O
in O

on O

it O

A O
viciousness O
in O
which O
no O

should O
ever O
incur O
whoever O
is O
a O

and O
aspires O
to O
be O
recognized O

such O
is O
that O
of O
patriotism O
, O
understood O
as O
the O
excessive O
and O
inopportune O
rumor O
of O
patriotism O
: O
the O
gastronomist O
is O
not O
apathetic O
, O
but O
must O
flee O
as O
from O
the O
plague O
of O
chovinism O

Years O

, O
in O
one O
of O
his O
travel O
books O
, O
the O
Nobel O
Literature O
laureate O
Camilo B-PER
José I-PER
Cela I-PER
claimed O
that O
the O
patriot O
is O
the O
one O
who O
is O
proud O
of O
the O
place O
where O
he O
was O
born O
and O
defends O
him O
, O
attitude O
in O
which O
he O
is O
right O
, O
while O
the O
patriot O
– O
at O
the O
time O
, O
Cela B-PER
used O
the O
word O
‘ O
nationalist O
’ O
– O
is O
the O
one O
who O
proclaims O
against O
the O
wind O
that O
his O
homeland O
is O
in O
all O
things O
superior O
to O
the O
others O
, O
something O
in O
which O
– O
Cela B-PER
said O
– O
he O
might O
well O
not O
be O
right O
. O

In O
this O
food O
there O
is O
too O
much O
patriotism O
. O

One O
has O
no O
inconvenience O
in O
accepting O
that O
each O
defends O
the O
cuisine O
and O
the O
products O
of O
his O
land O
... O
as O
long O
as O
that O
defense O
does O
not O
imply O
contempt O
because O
it O
is O
alien O
to O
the O
gastronomic O
customs O
of O
his O
solar O
homeland O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
pass O
from O
Cela B-PER
to O
Antonio B-PER
Machado I-PER
and O
remember O
that O
of O
" O
disdain O
as O
much O
as O
you O
ignore O
... O

“ O
The O
problem O
of O
gastronomic O
patriotism O
– O
and O
let O
us O
not O
deceive O
ourselves O
by O
any O
other O
– O
is O
precisely O
this O
: O
ignorance O
. O

Of O
course O
that O
same O
ignorance O
can O
cause O
many O
to O
fall O
into O
the O
opposite O
defect O
: O
the O
, O
say O
, O
papanatism O
that O
makes O
for O
these O
citizens O
everything O
foreign O
better O
. O

And O
... O
neither O
. O

A O
gastronomist O
is O
something O
like O
a O
traveler O
, O
but O
a O
traveler O
, O
not O
a O
tourist O
; O
a O
traveler O
, O
say O
, O
in O
the O
style O
of O
the O
nineteenth O
century O
, O
a O
person O
full O
of O
curiosity O
and O
liberated O
, O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
, O
from O
prejudices O
, O
willing O
to O
accept O
the O
good O
things O
of O
others O
without O
for O
that O
reason O
renegating O
of O
their O
own O
. O

But O
that O
universality O
of O
the O
gastronomist O
– O
the O
first O
to O
universalize O
gastronomy O
were O
the O
Romans O
– O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
renunciation O
to O
itself O
. O

Much O
less O
the O
absurd O
mixings O
, O
that O
kitchen O
that O
we O
today O
call O
‘ O
fusion O
’ O
, O
very O
defensive O
always O
. O
when O
it O
does O
not O
derive O
, O
as O
in O
so O
many O
cases O
, O
in O
the O

‘ O

We O
will O

But O
it O
must O
, O
how O
not O

be O
open O

What O
would O
it O
be O
of O
European O
cuisine O
, O
for O
example O
, O
without O
potatoes O
; O
or O
of O
Mediterranean O

without O

, O
products O
both O
that O
arrived O
in O
the O
Old B-MISC
World I-MISC
less O
than O
five O

... O

Imagine O
that O
among O
those O
Spaniards O
, O
who O
brought O
those O
American O
gifts O
to O
Europe B-LOC
, O
the O
gastronomic O
patriotry O
would O
have O
been O
imposed O
: O
potatoes O
and O
tomatoes O
would O
have O
remained O
in O
botanical O
curiosities O
. O

There O
is O
no O
, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
, O
universal O
cuisine O
; O
remember O
that O
horror O
known O
as O
‘ O
international O
cuisine O
’ O
so O
common O
in O
hotel O
restaurants O
. O

But O
there O
ca O
n’t O
be O
a O
kitchen O
that O
’s O
closed O
in O
itself O
. O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
ask O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
new O
food O
, O
a O
new O
species O
, O
where O
does O
this O
come O
from O
, O
without O
first O
investigating O
what O
is O
truly O
important O
: O
is O
it O
rich O
? O

If O
you O
are O
rich O
, O
come O
from O
where O
you O
come O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
must O
study O
how O
we O
adapt O
this O
new O
product O
to O
our O
more O
rooted O
culinary O
uses O
. O

So O
our O
kitchen O
evolves O
, O
enriches O
itself O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
closing O
in O
itself O
, O
ends O
up O
weakening O
and O
extinguishing O
; O
endogamy O
is O
not O
good O
for O
almost O
anything O
. O

So O
keep O
your O
mind O
open O
, O
and O
your O
senses O
even O
more O
. O

That O
, O
parafrasing O
Shakespeare B-PER
in O
Hamlet B-MISC
, O
there O
are O
more O
rich O
things O
on O
earth B-MISC
than O
your O
wisdom O
, O
or O
your O
personal O

reaches O
. O

Do O
not O
become O
eunuchs O

taste O
for O
mere O

: O
so O
many O
rich O

will O
be O

While O
Beirut B-ORG
considers O
the O

incomplete O
, O
because O
it O

Israel B-ORG

the O

assure O
these O

Syrian O

but O
Damascus O
and O
Beirut B-LOC
claim O
they O

, O
for O
that O
purpose O
, O
the O

sent O
several O

United B-ORG

to O
testify O
to O
their O

Hezbollah B-ORG
leader O
Sheikh O
Hasan B-PER

has O
announced O
that O
he O
will O
continue O
the O

In O

in O
the O

Apparently O
, O
Syria B-ORG
, O
which O

a O
preponderant O

in O

where O

some O
35,000 O

The O
Israeli B-ORG
withdrawal O
from O
the O
south O
was O
part O
of O
Israeli O
Prime O
Minister O
Ehud B-PER
Barak I-PER
’s O
strategy O
to O
force O
Syria B-ORG
into O
negotiations O
on O
the O
Golan B-LOC
, O
occupied O
by O
Israel B-ORG
in O
1967 O
and O
annexed O
in O
1981 O
. O

In O
theory O
, O
Syria B-ORG
is O
damaged O
by O
the O
unilateral O
Israeli O
withdrawal O
from O
southern O
Lebanon O
, O
as O
it O
deprives O
Damascus B-ORG
of O
a O
letter O
it O
used O
, O
through O
Hezbollah B-ORG
, O
to O
put O
pressure O
on O
Israel B-ORG
. O

However O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
Damascus B-ORG
, O
which O
shows O
itself O
inflexible O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
returning O
the O
Golan B-LOC
to O
the O
pre O
- O
June O
1967 O
demarcation O
line O
, O
seems O
to O
have O
forced O
Israel B-ORG
to O
execute O
its O
threat O
and O
has O
been O
strengthened O
in O
its O
control O
of O
Lebanon B-LOC
. O

If O
Israel B-ORG
occupied O
ten O
percent O
of O
Lebanon O
’s O
territory O
, O
the O
Syrian O
troops O
are O
deployed O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
country O
and O
it O
is O
not O
ruled O
out O
that O
they O
can O
be O
assigned O
a O
mission O
in O
southern O
Lebanon B-LOC
, O
so O
their O
withdrawal O
is O
complicated O
, O
despite O
the O
desire O
of O
a O
majority O
of O
Lebanese O
. O

The O
great O
powers O
have O
assigned O
Syria B-ORG
the O
role O
of O
guardian O
of O
Lebanon B-LOC
and O
know O
that O
if O
it O
fails O
to O
reach O
an O
agreement O
with O
Israel B-ORG
, O
the O
Lebanese O
situation O
will O
remain O
uncertain O
and O
unpredictable O
. O

The O
only O
hope O
that O
the O
Lebanese O
situation O
will O
stabilize O
is O
that O
global O
peace O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
will O
be O
achieved O
, O
so O
that O
this O
country O
, O
which O
has O
been O
the O
main O
victim O
, O
along O
with O
the O
Palestinians O
, O
of O

In O

explained O
that O
the O

the O
regulation O
that O

these O

, O
because O

a O

. O

Even O
, O
he O
added O
, O
in O

it O
is O
not O
even O
necessary O
for O
this O
function O
to O
be O
developed O
by O
a O
magistrate O
or O
a O

, O
but O
it O
is O
enough O
that O
it O

" O

not O

The O

studying O
the O
possibility O
that O

an O

that O

which O
will O

in O

among O

, O
Manuel B-PER
Lamela I-PER
, O
who O
nuanced O
that O

not O

, O
" O
but O
could O
be O
valued O
within O
the O
liberalization O

. O
" O

The O
distribution O
of O
fuel O
is O
an O
old O
claim O
of O
the O
agricultural O
cooperatives O
, O
which O
on O
many O
occasions O
have O
demanded O
to O
supply O
their O
associates O
not O
only O
agricultural O
gasoline O
, O
but O
also O
the O
rest O
of O
fuel O
, O
since O
1998 O
, O
a O
modification O
of O
the O
regulations O
in O
this O
matter O
prevented O
this O
practice O
. O

Lamela B-PER
made O
these O
statements O

He O
added O

" O
today O

On O
the O
possibility O
of O
lowering O
the O
taxes O
on O

he O
recalled O
that O
the O
taxation O
of O
gasoline O
B O
or O
agricultural O

“ O
very O
low O

so O
the O
margin O
of O

virtually O
nonexistent O

and O
pledged O
to O
look O
for O
formulas O
that O
palie O
the O
situation O
without O
distorting O
the O
economy O
. O

Agrarian O
and O

organizations O
insisted O

in O

on O
the O
negative O
impact O
that O
the O
rise O
in O
the O

The O

called O
the O

attitude O
“ O
inexplained O
” O
because O
, O
he O
said O
, O
the O

“ O
translating O

In O

opinion O

it O

a O

complex O

solution O
goes O
through O
the O
analysis O
of O
several O
factors O

First O
, O
Cuevas B-PER
said O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
analyze O
the O
conduct O
of O
the O

companies O
“ O
by O
whether O
they O
incur O
in O
some O
defect O
or O
infringement O
of O

” O
. O

On O
the O

hand O
, O
he O
said O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O

in O

prices O
in O

producing O
countries O
, O
and O
, O
in O
the O

" O
it O

necessary O
to O

role O
that O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
Cuevas B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
taxation O
is O
not O
something O
absolute O
and O
must O
function O
as O
each O
stage O

presented O
. O
” O

The O
president O
of O

advocated O
for O

" O
of O
the O

He O
also O
said O
that O
although O
the O

" O
they O
are O
a O
larger O
genre O
when O

they O
are O
short O
pieces O
but O
of O
the O
first O

" O
, O
while O
Joan B-PER

This O

each O
of O
whom O

three O

with O
their O

which O
helps O
to O
turn O
the O

a O

in O
a O
tribute O
to O
the O
itinerant O
actors O
of O
the O

according O

" O
a O
baroque O

Amorós B-PER
said O
that O
at O

has O
been O
obsessed O
with O
making O

an O

Among O
other O
considerations O

the O

that O
ERC B-ORG

“ O

“ O

not O
only O
as O
a O
satisfaction O

” O

For O
Bonet B-PER
, O
in O
ERC B-ORG
should O
not O
continue O
the O

we O
must O
try O

only O
requirement O
is O

” O
the O

states O

a O

A O
provision O

moved O
to O
the O
place O
indicated O
by O

after O
checking O
that O

4 O

they O

After O

, O
the O
Mossos B-ORG
confirmed O
that O
it O
was O
90 O

This O

that O

That O

two O

that O

that O
was O
on O

After O
bringing O
it O
to O

it O
was O
verified O
that O
it O
was O
more O
than O
4 O
tons O
of O
hashish O
that O
the O
drug O
dealers O
could O
not O
take O
from O
the O
beach O
because O
the O
car O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
transport O
them O
was O
stuck O
in O
the O

. O

According O
to O
the O

, O
possibly O
the O

had O
been O
made O
that O

night O
, O
but O
when O
the O
weather O

the O
car O
immobilized O
in O
the O

emerged O
, O
the O
drug O

preferred O
to O

. O

Precisely O
today O

the O
Civil B-ORG

has O
confirmed O
the O
detention O

a O
minimum O
of O
11 O

that O

its O

out O
that O
“ O

“ O

, O
after O
which O
it O
was O
determined O
that O
Viagra B-MISC
benefited O
those O
who O
had O
sexual O
problems O
after O
a O
hysterectomy O
. O

In O
response O
to O
Pfizer B-ORG

study O
, O
Berman B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
Before O
we O
conclude O
that O

n’t O
work O
, O
we O
have O
to O
limit O

those O

” O

In O
the O
Berman B-PER
study O
, O
all O

who O
had O
to O
undergo O
uterine O

complained O
of O
a O
decrease O
in O

during O

, O
but O
after O

, O
only O
22 O

the O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O

, O
the O

that O

lost O
their O
ability O
to O
reach O
orgasm O
, O
but O
after O
ingesting O
the O

, O
only O
16 O

The O

dropped O
from O

In O
any O

, O
Berman B-PER
thinks O
that O

" O

Moreno B-PER
offered O
in O
a O
press O
conference O
the O
latest O
data O
from O
surgical O
waiting O
lists O
that O
, O
as O
of O
March O
31 O
, O
were O
comprised O
of O
151,421 O
patients O
, O
compared O
to O
the O
142,000 O
there O
were O
in O
December O

. O

According O
to O
the O
data O
provided O
by O
Moreno B-PER
, O
the O
waiting O
list O
for O
more O
than O
six O
months O
was O
1,908 O
patients O
( O
513 O
in O
December O
1999 O
) O
, O
and O
the O
average O
delay O
was O
61 O
days O
, O
while O
the O
average O
wait O
was O
84 O
days O
. O

After O
insisting O
that O
the O
Government B-ORG
's O
will O
is O
to O
continue O
to O
progressively O
reduce O
the O
waiting O
list O
, O
for O
which O
a O
working O
group O
has O
already O
been O
constituted O
, O
Moreno B-PER
marked O
as O
an O
objective O
that O
the O
average O
delay O
is O
not O
greater O
than O
55 O
days O
and O
that O
no O
one O
is O
waiting O
for O
more O
than O
six O
months O
to O
be O
intervened O
surgically O
. O

For O
Moreno B-PER
, O
the O
main O
reasons O
that O
have O
influenced O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
waiting O
list O
( O
which O
has O
gone O
from O
142,000 O
that O
there O
were O
in O
December O
to O
151,421 O
in O
March O
2000 O
) O
are O
the O
increase O
in O
surgical O
activity O
, O
which O
brings O
more O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
coincidence O
with O
other O
conjunctual O
events O
, O
such O
as O
holidays O
. O

“ O
I O
ca O
n’t O
say O
that O
I O
’m O
satisfied O
with O
an O
average O
delay O
of O
61 O
days O
, O
nor O
with O
any O
day O
of O
delay O
, O
” O
Moreno B-PER
said O
, O
who O
noted O
that O
hospitals O
need O
to O
have O
a O
certain O
period O
to O
be O
able O
to O
schedule O
the O
surgical O
interventions O
. O

He O
also O
indicated O
that O
much O
of O
the O
decline O
in O
waiting O
lists O
that O
has O
occurred O
in O
recent O
years O
is O
due O
to O
the O
efforts O
of O
hospitals O
with O
the O
increase O
in O
surgical O
activity O
that O
in O
the O
January O
- O
April O
period O
grew O
by O
5.7 O
percent O
, O
which O
is O
11.400 O
interventions O
more O
than O
in O
the O
same O
period O
of O
1999 O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
he O
noted O
that O
in O
the O
period O
January O
- O
April O
were O
intervened O
4,619 O
patients O
in O
afternoon O
activity O
, O
of O
which O
1,151 O
were O
operated O
in O
April O
. O

Lastly O
, O
the O
president O
of O
Insalud B-ORG
expressed O
his O
desire O
that O
patients O
on O
the O
waiting O
list O
that O
have O
been O
waiting O
for O
more O
than O
90 O
days O
can O
choose O
the O
Insalud B-ORG
center O
in O
which O
they O
want O
to O
be O
operated O
and O
that O
they O
are O
not O
sent O
directly O
, O
and O
without O
possibility O
of O
choice O

that O
" O
today O
the O

it O

withdraw O

such O

Adega B-ORG
notes O
that O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
results O
of O
the O

to O
know O
the O
" O
enormous O
proliferation O
" O
of O
eucalyptus O
plantations O
, O
which O
Galician O
ecologists O
have O
denounced O
since O
years O

, O
and O
remember O
that O
they O
presented O
in O
the O
Parliament B-ORG
in O
the O
88 O
a O
forest O
legislative O
initiative O
that O
was O
rejected O
. O

Regardless O
that O
it O
considers O
“ O
a O
further O
measure O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
” O
this O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
eucalyptus O
subsidy O
, O
Adega B-ORG
says O
it O
is O
“ O
totally O
insufficient O
and O
clearly O
out O
of O
focus O
on O
objectives O
” O
. O

This O
association O
says O
that O
the O
increase O
in O
eucalyptus O
plantations O
responds O
to O
more O
motivations O
than O
aid O
, O
such O
as O
the O
“ O
enormous O
pressure O
of O
cellulose O
factories O
” O
, O
or O
the O
“ O
forced O
abandonment O
” O
and O
also O
subsidized O
“ O
of O
agricultural O
farms O
, O
which O
end O
up O
dedicating O
land O
to O
this O
species O
. O

“ O
The O
Department B-ORG
knows O
well O
, O
Adega B-ORG
notes O
, O
of O
the O
regression O
of O
our O
masses O
of O

against O

of O

of O
rapid O

mainly O

Therefore O
, O
he O
says O
that O
the O
native O

are O
those O
that O
require O
subsidies O
, O
both O
for O
plantations O
and O
for O

that O
it O
links O
the O
theme O
that O

his O

The O
until O

this O
initiative O
after O

of O

of O
Jiri B-PER
Georg I-PER
Dokoupil I-PER
in O
the O
Velázquez B-LOC

when O
at O
the O
request O
of O

made O
a O
balance O
of O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
in O
the O
almost O
six O
years O
he O
has O
remained O
at O
the O
head O
of O

has O
had O
the O
fortune O
to O
always O
have O
“ O
the O
support O
of O
the O
ministry O

the O

and O
above O
all O
, O
a O
team O
of O
professionals O
that O
has O
been O
at O
the O
height O
of O
a O
museum O
in O
constant O
evolution O
” O
. O

This O
has O
allowed O
him O
to O
advance O
a O
project O
that O
began O
with O
his O
appointment O
by O
the O
Socialist O
Minister O
of O
Culture B-MISC
Carmen B-PER
Alborch I-PER
and O
was O
not O
interrupted O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
PP B-ORG
to O
power O
and O
the O
successive O
appointments O
of O
Esperanza B-PER
Aguirre I-PER

Mariano B-PER
Rajoy I-PER
as O
ministers O
of O
Education B-MISC

His O
sintony O
was O
special O
with O
the O
previous O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
for O
Culture B-MISC
, O
Miguel B-PER
Angel I-PER
Cortés I-PER
, O
who O
always O
supported O
the O
initiatives O
of O
the O
museum O
, O
although O
Guirao B-PER
said O
that O
" O
more O
than O
personal O
relationships O
, O
the O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
have O
projects O
" O
. O

The O
until O
now O
director O
of O
the O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
insisted O
that O
at O
no O
time O
has O
had O
pressure O
from O
the O
administration O
and O
has O
received O
a O
support O
that O
has O
translated O
into O
an O
increase O
in O
economic O
means O
. O

He O
recalled O
that O
for O
this O
year O
the O
ordinary O
budget O
of O
the O
museum O
passed O
from O
400 O
million.1500 O
million O
and O
in O
recent O
years O
the O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
has O
had O
many O
economic O
resources O
, O
both O
by O
budgetary O
means O
and O
by O
means O
of O
taxes O
( O
payment O
in O
tax O
terms O
) O
, O
to O
buy O
quality O
works O
. O

This O
has O
allowed O
him O
to O
complete O
gaps O
in O
the O
collection O
with O
the O
incorporation O
of O
works O
by O
Juan B-PER
Gris I-PER
, O
Miró B-PER
and O
Picasso B-PER
and O
initiate O
the O
project O
to O
expand O
the O
facilities O
. O

Guirao B-PER
trusted O
that O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
new O
team O
to O
the O
museum O
there O
will O
be O
continuity O
in O
the O
recovery O
of O
significant O
Spanish O
artists O
, O
although O
he O
considered O
that O
that O
is O
a O
approach O
that O
corresponds O
to O
his O
successor O
. O

The O
director O
of O
Reina B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
, O
who O
considers O
himself O
lucky O
to O
have O
been O
able O
to O
develop O
his O
project O
and O
does O
not O
feel O
frustrated O
by O
its O
cessation O
, O
explained O
that O
the O
key O
to O
his O
management O
has O
been O
“ O
to O
work O
and O
let O
his O
team O
work O
. O
” O

He O
added O
that O
one O
of O
the O
challenges O
that O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
is O
facing O
now O
is O
the O
increase O
in O
human O
resources O
, O
“ O
very O
necessary O
because O
the O

works O
thanks O
to O
the O
work O
and O
generosity O
of O
the O

” O

As O
for O
the O
most O
complicated O
moments O
lived O
during O
his O

he O
noted O
that O
the O

” O
today O
, O
the O
day O
after O
a O

to O

, O
Pujol B-PER
stressed O
that O
to O
avoid O
“ O
pateras O
” O
one O
must O
follow O
the O
advice O
of O
Moroccan O
writer O
Tahar B-PER
Ben I-PER
Jelloun I-PER
and O
invest O
in O
poor O
countries O
so O
that O
they O
develop O
so O
that O
their O
inhabitants O
do O
not O
have O
to O
emigrate O
. O

“ O
The O

, O
the O
most O
anti O

, O
would O
be O
for O
Spain B-ORG
and O
France B-ORG
to O
invest O
in O
the O
Maghreb B-LOC
and O
create O
jobs O
in O
Morocco B-LOC
so O
that O
no O
one O
is O
forced O
to O
emigrate O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

According O
to O
Pujol B-PER
, O
“ O
there O
would O
be O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
hypocrisy O
of O
some O
so O
- O
called O
‘ O
progressive O
’ O
parties O
that O
grasp O
the O
flag O
of O
solidarity O
with O
immigrants O
while O
opposing O
investments O
in O
North O
Africa B-LOC
because O
they O
endanger O
local O
jobs O
. O
” O

In O
addition O
, O
he O
considered O
that O
“ O
a O
vigorous O
investment O
policy O
in O
the O
Maghreb B-LOC
could O
only O
favor O
European O
economic O
expansion O
in O
the O
Mediterranean O
region O
. O
” O

As O
for O
the O
benefits O
of O
immigration O
for O
Western O
European O
societies O
with O
low O
birth O
rates O
, O
he O
said O
they O
are O
" O
indisputable O
" O
because O
they O
contribute O
to O
" O
increasing O
the O
working O
population O
and O
thus O
facilitating O
the O
maintenance O
of O
collective O
well O
- O
being O
" O
. O

However O
, O
he O
warned O
that O
these O
positive O
effects O
“ O
are O
lost O
in O
part O
due O
to O
the O
flooding O
of O
the O
migratory O
stream O
. O
” O

He O
also O
cautioned O
that O
“ O
one O
of O
the O
most O
worrying O
problems O
is O
religious O
fundamentalism O
” O
which O
“ O
has O
an O
impact O
on O
immigration O
properly O
but O
also O
on O
the O
international O
coexistence O
of O
the O
two O
shores O
of O
the O
Mediterranean B-MISC
” O
. O

To O
deal O
with O
it O
, O
according O
to O
Pujol B-PER
, O
“ O
we O
must O
believe O
the O
experts O
on O
the O
Maghreb B-LOC
when O
they O
tell O
us O
that O
Islamic O
integrism O
will O
lose O
strength O
with O
economic O
prosperity O
” O
, O
since O
“ O
it O
only O
grows O
with O
frustration O
and O
with O
the O
inability O
to O
obtain O
material O
goods O
” O
, O
so O
“ O
economic O
well O
- O
being O
would O
be O
the O
best O
antidote O
against O
religious O
extremism O
” O
. O

He O
explained O
that O
the O
goal O
in O
the O
societies O
that O
receive O
immigrants O
is O
“ O
social O
integration O
, O
coexistence O
and O
respect O
for O
cultural O
particularities O
” O
, O
which O
demands O
“ O

” O
, O
as O
demonstrated O

The O

of O
professionals O
that O
has O
been O
at O
the O
height O
of O
a O
museum O
in O
constant O
evolution O
” O
. O

This O
has O
allowed O
him O
to O
advance O
a O
project O
that O
began O
with O
his O
appointment O
by O
the O
Socialist O
Minister O
of O
Culture B-MISC
Carmen B-PER
Alborch I-PER
and O
was O
not O
interrupted O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
PP B-ORG
to O
power O
and O
the O
successive O
appointments O
of O
Esperanza B-PER
Aguirre I-PER
and O
Mariano B-PER
Rajoy I-PER
as O
ministers O
of O
Education B-MISC
. O

His O
sintony O
was O
special O
with O
the O
previous O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
for O
Culture B-MISC
, O
Miguel B-PER
Angel I-PER
Cortés I-PER
, O
who O
always O
supported O
the O
initiatives O
of O
the O
museum O
, O
although O
Guirao B-PER
said O
that O
" O
more O
than O
personal O
relationships O
, O
the O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
have O
projects O
" O
. O

The O
until O
now O
director O
of O
the O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
insisted O
that O
at O
no O
time O
has O
had O
pressure O
from O
the O
Administration B-ORG
and O
has O
received O
a O
support O
that O
translated O
into O
an O
increase O
in O
economic O
means O
. O

He O
recalled O
that O
for O
this O
year O
the O
ordinary O
budget O
of O
the O
museum O
passed O
from O
400 O
million.1500 O
million O
and O
in O
recent O
years O
the O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
has O
had O
many O
economic O
resources O
, O
both O
by O
budgetary O
means O
and O
by O
means O
of O
taxes O
( O
payment O
in O
tax O
terms O
) O
, O
to O
buy O
quality O
works O
. O

This O
has O
allowed O
him O
to O
complete O
gaps O
in O
the O
collection O
with O
the O
incorporation O
of O
works O
by O
Juan B-PER
Gris I-PER
, O
Miró B-PER
and O
Picasso B-PER
and O
initiate O
the O
project O
to O
expand O
the O
facilities O
. O

Guirao B-PER
trusted O
that O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
new O
team O
to O
the O
museum O
there O
will O
be O
continuity O
in O
the O
recovery O
of O
significant O
Spanish O
artists O
, O
although O
he O
considered O
that O
this O
is O
a O
approach O
that O
corresponds O
to O
his O
successor O
. O

The O
director O
of O
Reina B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
, O
who O
considers O
himself O
lucky O
to O
have O
been O
able O
to O
develop O
his O
project O
and O
does O
not O
feel O
frustrated O
by O
its O
cessation O
, O
explained O
that O
the O
key O
to O
his O
management O
has O
been O
“ O
to O
work O
and O
let O
his O
team O
work O
. O
” O

He O
added O
that O
one O
of O
the O
challenges O
that O
Queen B-ORG
Sofia I-ORG
is O
facing O
now O
is O
the O
increase O
in O
human O
resources O
, O
“ O
very O
necessary O
because O
the O
museum O
works O
thanks O
to O
the O
work O
and O
generosity O
of O
the O
people O
. O
” O

As O
for O
the O
most O
complicated O
moments O
lived O
during O
his O
management O
, O
he O
noted O
that O
the O
first O
was O
his O
arrival O
at O
the O
center O
, O
with O
the O
resignation O
of O
several O
members O
of O
the O
patronage O
and O
the O
other O
occurred O
with O
the O
controversy O
raised O
by O

The O

Díez I-PER
complained O
that O

“ O

on O

accelerate O
the O
cutting O
of O
their O
public O

and O
advance O
the O
budget O
balance O

In O
the O
presentation O
of O
a O
report O
on O
public O
finances O
in O
the O
EU B-ORG
, O
Solbes B-PER
insisted O
that O
if O
governments O
reach O
the O
balance O
for O
2002 O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
year O
later O
as O
predicted O
by O
the O
majority O
, O
they O
will O
increase O
in O
several O
points O
the O
margin O
needed O
to O
make O
tax O
cuts O
that O
stimulate O
growth O
and O
generate O
jobs O
. O

This O
margin O
will O
serve O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
to O
ease O
the O
burden O
that O
budgets O
will O
have O
to O
bear O
due O
to O
the O
ageing O
population O
, O
Solbes B-PER
said O
. O

" O
The O
more O
the O
deficit O
is O
reduced O
now O
, O
the O
greater O
the O
margin O
there O
will O
be O
" O
to O
bear O
that O
burden O
, O
although O
for O
almost O
all O
states B-ORG
" O
it O

not O

also O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O

" O
, O
he O
said O
. O

The O
European O
Commissioner O
stressed O
that O
the O
boost O
in O
economic O
growth O
over O
the O
past O
two O
years O
should O
serve O
to O
accelerate O
that O
deficit O
reduction O
, O
which O
has O
slowed O
in O
the O
past O
two O
years O
. O

Solbes B-PER
explained O
that O
speeding O
up O
fiscal O
consolidation O
is O
still O
“ O
more O
unavoidable O
” O
at O
a O
time O
like O
the O
current O
, O
characterized O
by O
“ O
a O
strong O
activity O
in O
the O
private O
sector O
” O
. O

If O
European O
governments O
do O
not O
reduce O
the O
budget O
deficit O
at O
this O
time O
and O
through O
public O
spending O
or O
tax O
cuts O
further O
stimulate O
demand O
, O
“ O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
can O
do O
is O
throw O
more O
wood O
on O
fire O
, O
increase O
inflation O
and O
shorten O
the O
period O
of O
growth O
, O
” O
Solbes B-PER
explained O
. O

“ O
This O
is O
exactly O
what O
we O
have O
done O
other O
times O
and O
exactly O
the O
opposite O
of O
what O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve I-ORG
did O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
” O
he O
added O
. O

Solbes B-PER
stressed O
that O
while O
the O
priority O
should O
be O
to O
end O
the O
public O
deficit O
, O
they O
can O
always O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
parallel O
tax O
cuts O
or O
restructuring O
of O
public O
spending O
. O

Tax O
cuts O
should O
, O
in O
their O
opinion O
, O
be O
aimed O
at O
reducing O
non O
- O
wage O
labor O
costs O
, O
while O
public O
spending O
should O
“ O
improve O
its O
quality O
” O
by O
focusing O
on O
more O
profitable O

and O
human O

. O

With O
a O
simple O
cut O
in O
labor O

equivalent O
to O
1 O
percent O
of O

, O
the O
report O
notes O
that O
between O

open O

The O
intention O
of O
the O

as O
explained O
by O

is O
to O

" O
Naturally O
, O
" O
Tur B-PER
continued O
, O
this O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
the O

in O

that O

The O

that O
the O

poses O
" O
an O

themselves O

who O

and O
the O
economic O
interest O

his O

, O
according O
to O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O

asked O
for O
the O
free O
absolution O
of O
his O
sponsored O
and O
, O

The O
doctor O
, O
according O
to O
the O
defense O
sources O
, O
argued O
that O
the O
minor O
, O
who O
was O
15 O
years O
old O
when O
the O
events O
occurred O
, O
did O
not O
present O
injuries O
or O
signs O
of O
having O
suffered O
a O
sexual O
assault O
. O

In O
the O
trial O
, O
the O
forensics O
of O
the O
courts O
also O
testified O
as O
experts O
, O
who O
determined O
that O
the O
minor O
suffers O
from O
a O
mental O
retardation O
of O
60 O
percent O
and O
is O
suggestible O
and O
easily O
manipulable O
. O

The O
facts O
date O
back O
to O
the O
month O
of O
June O
1998 O
, O
when O
the O
accused O
was O
performing O
cottonwork O
at O
the O
victim O
’s O
family O
home O
. O

According O
to O
the O
prosecutor O
’s O
account O
of O
the O
facts O
, O
the O
man O
took O
the O
minor O
to O
a O
nearby O
home O
and O
there O
allegedly O
disguised O
the O
victim O
, O
made O
touches O
in O
the O
genital O
area O
and O
finally O
consumed O
the O
sexual O
act O

The O
public O
prosecution O
argues O
that O
the O
accused O
took O
advantage O
of O
the O
minor O
’s O
mental O
retardation O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O

suggestible O

" O

" O

“ O
The O

by O

that O

to O

under O

that O
, O
surely O
, O
read O
both O

that O

” O
says O
this O
writer O
, O
translator O
, O

and O
journalist O
on O

. O

The O
author O
assures O
that O
she O
has O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
when O
a O
critic O
says O
that O
“ O
something O
is O
feminine O
means O
it O
is O
bad O
. O
” O

This O
association O
is O
always O
made O
and O
, O
moreover O
, O
when O
a O
critic O
speaks O
of O
women O
, O
he O
means O
a O
person O
with O
a O
poor O
literary O
taste O
. O
” O

To O
support O
his O
theory O
, O
Freixas B-PER
provides O
an O
example O
of O
a O
literary O
criticism O
in O
which O
a O
commentator O
of O
a O
literary O
supplement O
claimed O
, O
referring O
to O
a O
Planet B-MISC
Award I-MISC
winner O
. O

“ O
It O
’s O
a O
book O
that O
goes O
directly O
to O
the O
female O
heart O
, O
to O
that O
curly O
, O
and O
tender O

that O
carries O
within O
the O
entire O

. O
” O

“ O
It O
means O
, O
says O
Freixas B-PER
, O
that O
when O
a O
person O
likes O
bad O
literature O
, O
it O
is O
that O
he O
is O
a O
woman O
, O
that O
is O

that O
the O
feminine O
is O
of O
the O
second O
category O
and O
the O
masculine O
is O
of O
the O
first O
. O
” O

According O
to O
the O
writer O
, O
this O
is O
a O
theory O
that O
is O
deeply O
rooted O
in O
Spanish O
society O
, O
which O
does O
not O
realize O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
literature O
students O
are O
women O
and O
that O
therefore O
high O
literature O
is O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
women O

denounces O
that O

“ O
are O
gaining O
quote O
but O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
no O

and O
that O
’s O
due O
to O
an O
ancient O
hostility O
that O
comes O
to O
our O
days O
towards O
the O

. O
” O

" O
This O
happens O
throughout O

to O
accelerate O
the O
cutting O
of O
their O
public O
deficit O
and O
advance O
the O
budget O
balance O

In O
the O
presentation O
of O
a O
report O
on O
public O
finances O
in O
the O
EU B-ORG
, O
Solbes B-PER
insisted O
that O
if O
governments O
reach O
the O
balance O
for O
2002 O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
year O
later O
as O
predicted O
by O
the O
majority O
, O
they O
will O
increase O
in O
several O
points O
the O
margin O
needed O
to O
make O
tax O
cuts O
that O
stimulate O
growth O
and O
generate O
jobs O
. O

This O
margin O
will O
serve O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
to O
ease O
the O
burden O
that O
budgets O
will O
have O
to O
bear O
due O
to O
the O
ageing O
population O
, O
Solbes B-PER
said O
. O

" O
The O
more O
the O
deficit O
is O
reduced O
now O
, O
the O
greater O
the O
margin O
there O
will O
be O
" O
to O
bear O
that O
burden O
, O
although O
for O
almost O
all O
states O
" O
it O
will O
not O
be O

" O
and O
" O
it O
will O
also O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
reform O
of O

" O
, O
he O
said O
. O

The O
European O
Commissioner O
stressed O
that O
the O
boost O
in O
economic O
growth O
over O
the O
past O
two O
years O
should O
serve O
to O
accelerate O
that O
deficit O
reduction O
, O
which O
has O
slowed O
in O
the O
past O
two O
years O
. O

Solbes B-PER
explained O
that O
speeding O
up O
fiscal O
consolidation O
is O
still O
“ O
more O
unavoidable O
” O
at O
a O
time O
like O
the O
current O
, O
characterized O
by O
“ O
a O
strong O
activity O
in O
the O
private O
sector O
” O
. O

If O
European O
governments O
do O
not O
reduce O
the O
budget O
deficit O
at O
this O
time O
and O
through O
public O
spending O
or O
tax O
cuts O
further O
stimulate O
demand O
, O
“ O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
can O
do O
is O
throw O
more O
wood O
on O
fire O
, O
increase O
inflation O
and O
shorten O
the O
period O
of O
growth O
, O
” O
Solbes B-PER
explained O
. O

“ O
This O
is O
exactly O
what O
we O
have O
done O
other O
times O
and O
exactly O
the O
opposite O
of O
what O
the O
Federal B-ORG

did O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
” O
he O
added O
. O

Solbes B-PER
stressed O
that O
while O
the O
priority O
should O
be O
to O
end O
the O
public O
deficit O
, O
they O
can O
always O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
parallel O
tax O
cuts O
or O
restructuring O
of O
public O
spending O
. O

Tax O
cuts O
should O
, O
in O
their O
opinion O
, O
be O
aimed O
at O
reducing O
non O
- O
wage O
labor O
costs O
, O
while O
public O
spending O
should O
“ O
improve O
its O
quality O
” O
by O
focusing O
on O
more O
profitable O

and O
human O

. O

With O
a O
simple O
cut O
in O

equivalent O
to O

the O

that O
between O

, O
after O
a O
meeting O
with O
Monti B-PER
, O
that O
" O
the O

because O
only O

" O

The O

explained O
that O

“ O
At O
this O

we O
are O

” O
he O
added O
. O

The O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
decided O
to O
open O
the O
case O
against O
the O
fiscal O
aid O
systems O
established O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
Navarra B-LOC
on O
14 O
July O
1999 O
and O
, O
although O
the O
decision O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
immediate O
condemnation O
of O
the O
same O
, O
it O
may O
in O
theory O
lead O
to O
the O
obligation O
to O
return O

. O

On O
that O
occasion O
Brussels B-ORG
made O
clear O
that O
it O
did O
not O
question O
the O
fiscal O
competences O
that O
both O

have O
thanks O
to O
the O
Guernica B-MISC
Statute I-MISC
and O
the O
Foral B-MISC
Statute I-MISC
of I-MISC

, O
but O
some O
measures O
of O
their O

that O
it O
considered O
" O
discriminatory O
" O
and O
incompatible O
with O
European O
standards O
of O

competition O
. O

The O
then O
Commissioner O
for O

, O
Karel B-PER

, O
argued O
that O

has O
characteristics O

" O
state B-ORG
aid O
" O
and O
" O
can O
be O
considered O
illegal O
" O
since O
" O
it O
is O
financed O
with O

, O
favors O
certain O

distorts O

In O
the O
face O
of O
this O
opinion O
of O
the O

the O

said O
today O
that O
the O

" O
in O
no O
case O
can O
be O
considered O
as O

, O
since O
the O
four O
cases O
in O
which O
companies O
have O
opted O
for O
that O
type O
of O
tax O
aid O
have O
been O
able O
to O
deduct O
from O
the O
corporate O
tax O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
million O
pesetas O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
compared O
that O
amount O
to O
the O
528 O
million O
pesetas O
that O
, O
he O
said O
, O
those O
same O
companies O
could O
have O
saved O
if O
they O
had O
opted O
for O
direct O
aid O
to O
investment O
and O
employment O
on O
fixed O
assets O
: O
" O
but O
as O
our O
tax O
aid O
in O
exemptions O
from O
corporate O
tax O
are O
incompatible O
with O
direct O
aid O
, O
they O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
so O
and O
have O
been O
clearly O
disadvantaged O

Sanz B-PER
added O

have O
very O
clearly O
is O
that O
in O
the O
First B-MISC
we O
have O
to O
go O
up O
those O
who O
have O
lowered O
us O
certain O

because O
there O
will O
be O
some O
who O
will O
have O

go O

Zambrano B-PER
offered O
his O
vision O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC

the O
recipe O
that O
Atlético B-ORG
should O
apply O
to O
return O
in O
a O
year O
to O
First B-MISC
Division O
. O

In O
Second B-MISC
you O
have O
to O
fight O
first O
and O
then O
play O
football O
, O
while O
in O
First B-MISC
you O
have O
to O
play O
football O
and O
then O
fight O
. O

I O
think O
Atlético B-ORG
wo O
n’t O
cost O
it O
because O
they O
have O
footballers O

play O
in O

During O

to O
the O

General I-MISC

held O
in O

today O
, O
the O

that O

of O
the O
imminent O

and O
internationalization O
of O
the O

, O
the O
European B-ORG

“ O

as O
many O

dangers O
” O
. O

“ O
The O
reference O
is O
the O
US B-ORG
, O
” O
whose O
economic O
growth O
, O
in O
Cuevas B-PER
’ O
opinion O
, O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Berlin B-MISC
Wall I-MISC
that O
generated O
the O
practical O
disappearance O
of O
communism O
and O
the O
entry O
of O
many O
of O
these O
countries O
into O
the O
market O
economy O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
possibility O
that O
North O
America B-ORG
invested O
in O
the O
civil O
sphere O
what O
was O
previously O
destined O
to O
the O
military O
. O

Outside O
this O
framework O
of O
global O
prosperity O
there O
are O
countries O
such O
as O
Africans O
who O
do O
not O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
add O
to O
it O
and O
whose O
endemic O
evils O
are O
, O
according O
to O
Cuevas B-PER
, O
“ O
tribalism O
, O
backwardness O
and O
unceasing O
wars O
. O
” O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
he O
recalled O
that O
more O
than O
six O
hundred O
companies O
have O
invested O
in O
Morocco B-LOC
in O
recent O
years O
and O
assured O
that O
“ O
the O
economic O
development O
of O
our O
southern O
neighbors O
is O
the O
best O
way O
to O
avoid O
the O
excessive O
immigration O
current O
” O
. O

For O
the O
CEOE B-ORG
president O
, O
globalization O
is O
" O
the O
great O
hope O
of O
the O
underdeveloped O
world O
" O
, O
although O
he O
noted O
that O
true O
globalization O
" O
which O
is O
economic O
" O
will O
not O
exist O
without O
the O
liberalization O
of O
world O
trade O
, O
" O
very O
distant O
goal O
" O
despite O
China B-ORG
's O
recent O
entry O
into O
the O
World B-ORG
Trade I-ORG
Organization I-ORG
( O
WTO B-ORG
) O
" O
is O
a O
very O
important O
step O
" O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Cuevas B-PER
criticized O
the O
anti O
- O
capitalist O
movements O
harshly O
since O
, O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
the O
miserable O
peoples O
will O
not O
come O
forward O
without O
entering O
the O
market O
economy O
, O
receiving O
foreign O
investments O
, O
guaranteeing O
them O
with O
democratic O
political O
systems O
and O
developing O
their O
industrial O
capacities O
and O
their O
services O
sectors O
. O
” O

In O
the O
face O
of O
this O
problem O
, O
he O
said O
, O
the O
EU B-ORG
" O
does O
not O
play O
a O
clarifier O
role O
" O
since O
it O
" O
has O
limited O
its O
borders O
" O
to O
the O
products O
of O
the O
third O
world O
and O
to O
the O
workforce O
of O
poor O
areas O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
his O
intervention O
Cuevas B-PER
put O
several O
times O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
as O
an O
example O
both O
in O
job O
creation O
rates O
" O
due O
to O
a O
foreign O
labour O
integration O
policy O
" O
and O
in O
technological O
advances O
. O

For O
Spain B-ORG
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
it O
is O
vital O
not O
to O
lose O
the O
capabilities O
that O
the O
scientific O
- O
technical O
revolution O
gives O
" O
, O
so O
he O
urged O
the O
public O
powers O
to O
increase O
their O
investments O
and O
consider O
" O
impossible O
" O
the O
new O
communication O

. O

In O
order O
for O
Europe B-ORG
to O
increase O
its O
competitive O
advantages O
over O
the O
US B-ORG
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
, O
among O
other O
measures O
, O
to O
cut O
public O
spending O
, O
increase O
the O
share O
of O
immigrants O
, O
not O
decrease O
working O
days O
, O
reduce O
inflationary O
tensions O
and O
increase O
its O
investment O
in O
R&D. B-MISC

As O
a O
result O
of O
these O
measures O
, O
already O
put O
in O
place O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
, O
the O
dollar O
is O
a O
solid O
currency O
that O
“ O
wins O
ground O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
euro O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
he O
precised O
that O
the O
euro O
’s O
quotation O
“ O
payes O
one O
day O
after O
the O
other O
various O
national O
errors O
” O
such O
as O
the O
35 O
hours O
of O

, O
the O
breach O
of O
the O
Stability B-MISC
Pact I-MISC
in O
Italy B-LOC
and O
excessive O
wage O
growth O
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

In O
summary O
, O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
there O
are O
many O
and O
very O
deep O
structural O
reforms O
” O
that O
Europe B-ORG
must O
face O
, O
despite O
which O
, O
in O
recent O
years O
, O
Spain B-ORG
has O
been O
at O
the O
forefront O
of O
European O
growth O
and O
has O
reduced O
the O
income O
difference O
that O
separated O
it O
from O
the O
EU B-ORG
average O
and O
that O
has O
gone O
from O
78 O
to O
82 O

. O

Lastly O
, O
Cuevas B-PER
listed O
some O
of O
the O
objectives O
of O
the O

The O

sought O
to O

The O
coup O

reflects O
the O
dissatisfaction O
that O

since O
the O

Some O
sectors O

last O

The O
assault O

day O
that O

The O

The O

decided O
to O
open O
the O

systems O
established O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC

Navarra B-LOC

, O
although O
the O
decision O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
immediate O
condemnation O

, O
it O

in O

On O

that O
it O

not O
question O
the O

that O
both O

thanks O
to O
the O
Guernica B-MISC
Statute I-MISC

the O
Foral B-MISC

, O
but O
some O

that O
it O
considered O

The O

" O

" O
can O
be O

In O

today O
that O

no O

since O
the O
four O
cases O
in O
which O
companies O
have O
opted O
for O
that O
type O

have O
been O

: O
" O

as O
our O

analyzing O
which O

the O
two O
is O
the O
most O
convenient O

Both O

have O
a O
similar O

– O
about O
$ O
35 O
billion O
– O
and O
while O
the O
pipeline O
has O
a O
lower O

because O
it O
does O

it O
has O

Meanwhile O
, O
transporting O
the O
gas O
by O

implies O
the O

but O
it O

that O
, O
if O
a O
greater O
amount O
of O
this O

needed O
in O

it O

according O

who O
added O
that O

12 O

From O
the O

criticized O

bring O
it O
by O

from O

This O
" O
delay O
" O
means O
" O
a O

that O
can O
lead O

an O
increase O

the O
cost O

, O
therefore O

the O

The O
judgment O
of O
the O
Fourth B-MISC
Section I-MISC
, O
to O
which O
Efe B-ORG
has O
had O
access O
, O
says O
that O
the O
victim O
's O
version O
has O
more O
" O
internal O
consistency O
" O
and O
more O
" O
convincing O
force O
of O
the O
whole O
testimony O
" O
than O
the O
one O
offered O
by O
the O
accused O
, O
defined O
as O
" O
invasive O
and O
full O
of O
incongruencies O
" O
. O

The O
accused O
argued O
in O
the O
trial O
that O
the O
relationships O
were O
consented O
and O
attributed O
the O
complaint O
to O
his O
ex O
- O
boyfriend O
’s O
resentment O
because O
he O
had O
just O
communicated O
his O
unilateral O
decision O
to O
break O
the O
relationship O
and O
return O
to O
his O
first O
wife O
, O
but O
the O
verdict O
considers O
that O
the O
only O
proof O
of O
such O
a O
“ O
imposed O
break O
” O
is O
the O
prosecutor O
’s O
statement O
. O

The O
sentence O
is O
also O
based O
on O
the O
numerous O
injuries O
that O
the O
woman O
suffered O
in O
being O
hit O
in O
the O
campsite O
, O
which O
produced O
" O
hematomas O
in O
both O
axils O
, O
contusion O
in O
the O
left O
ear O
, O
contusion O
in O
the O
temporary O
zone O
, O
hematoma O
in O

right O
ceiling O
, O
contusions O
in O
the O

zones O

left O
gluteal O
zone O
, O
facial O
contusions O
and O
fissure O
of O
the O
tenth O
rib O
" O
, O
for O
which O
the O
judges O
impose O
the O
prosecution O
six O
weekends O
of O
arrest O
. O

The O
judgment O
says O
that O
these O
" O
spectacular O
stigmas O
of O
violence O
" O
, O
although O
produced O
at O
a O
time O
prior O
to O
the O
sexual O
act O
, O
are O
a O
further O
proof O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
consent O
of O
the O
victim O
, O
since O
" O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
the O
violence O
required O
in O
sexual O
assaults O
with O
vaginal O
penetration O
does O
not O
have O
to O
fall O
precisely O
on O
the O
genital O
area O
. O
" O

The O
judges O
refer O
to O
the O
" O
incongruities O
" O
of O
the O
accused O
's O
version O
, O
since O
" O
if O
she O
had O
been O
a O
year O
manifesting O
her O
will O
to O
return O
with O
her O
family O
, O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
explain O
why O
only O
a O
month O
before O
the O
events O
began O
to O
live O
together O
" O
or O
why O
" O
she O
went O
to O
look O
for O
her O
to O
the O
club O
at O
high O
hours O
of O
the O
night O
" O
. O

“ O
Unless O
the O
relationships O
were O
mounted O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
most O
elemental O
sadomasochism O
” O
– O
adds O
the O
sentence O
– O
it O
is O
not O
understood O
that O
“ O
a O
woman O
who O
has O
just O
been O
brutally O
assaulted O
is O
immediately O
willing O
to O
throw O
fur O
in O
the O
sea O
and O
throw O
herself O
into O
the O
arms O
of O
her O
aggressor O
to O
have O
sex O
with O
him O
not O
once O
, O
but O
twice O
in O
the O
version O
of O
this O
one O

” O

Therefore O
, O
the O
verdict O
rejects O
the O
absolution O
requested O
by O
the O
prosecutor O

imposes O

With O

“ O

whether O

which O
was O

a O
great O

" O
I O
wanted O

he O
achieved O
it O
with O

he O
“ O

answers O

a O

a O
" O

Since O

Rulfo B-PER
never O

Within O

with O
the O
opposition O
to O
Yugoslav O
President O
Slobodan B-PER
Milosevic I-PER
, O
the O
population O
has O
begun O
to O
play O
cards O
with O
a O
barge O
in O
which O
their O
caricaturized O
leaders O
paint O
hearts O
, O
sticks O
and O
other O

. O

These O
barracks O
were O
sold O
four O

for O
the O
equivalent O
of O
two O

but O
they O
are O

the O
few O
that O
there O

The O
king O

Vojislav B-PER
Seselj I-PER

who O

weighing O
a O

Milosevic B-PER

Mira B-PER
Markovic I-PER

a O

that O
" O
a O
Serbian O

, O
to O
which O
Milosevic B-PER

Whatever O
it O
is O
, O
while O

for O

This O

two O

Serbian O

announce O
that O
they O
will O

The O

Borislav B-PER

is O
an O

in O
Moscow B-LOC

a O
direct O

In O
the O
EU B-ORG
there O
are O
two O
countries O

Italy B-ORG

Greece B-ORG

that O
publicly O
demonstrate O
in O

abolishing O
the O

But O
even O
Rome B-ORG
has O
been O
in O

The O
Popular B-ORG

has O
asked O
Basque O
Government B-MISC
Labour I-MISC
Minister O
Sabin B-PER
Intxaurraga I-PER
to O
solve O
the O
problems O
faced O
by O
the O
Basque O
Economic B-ORG

( O

in O
order O
to O
ensure O
its O
normal O
functioning O

Through O
an O
initiative O
presented O
in O
the O
Basque B-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
, O
the O
PP B-ORG
parliamentary O
Fernando B-PER
Maura I-PER
recalls O
that O
in O
a O
recent O
appearance O
in O
the O
Basque O

the O
CES B-ORG
officials O
recognized O
that O
there O

no O
normal O
functioning O
of O
the O

According O
to O
Maura B-PER
, O
the O
balance O
of O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
CES B-ORG
“ O
appears O
quite O
unfortunate O
because O
in O
most O
initiatives O
veto O
or O
absence O
of O
opinion O
has O
been O
produced O
” O
. O

The O
PP B-ORG
parliamentary O
puts O
out O
in O
his O
initiative O
that O
one O
of O
the O
solutions O
raised O
by O
the O
CES B-ORG
responsible O
to O
overcome O
this O
situation O
would O
mean O
the O
modification O
of O
the O
law O
that O
regulates O
the O
labor O
body O
to O
prevent O
vetoes O
that O
hinder O
its O
functioning O
. O

The O
other O
solution O
pointed O
out O
goes O
through O
the O
adoption O
of O
the O
French O
system O
, O
which O
provides O
, O
more O
than O
a O
consensus O
opinion O
, O
the O
delivery O
to O
the O
petitioning O
body O
of O
the O
documentation O
generated O
by O
the O
different O
groups O
of O
the O

, O
although O
in O
this O
case O
they O
would O
not O
resolve O
" O
the O
assumptions O
that O
the O
veto O
is O
produced O
with O
prior O
to O
the O
elaboration O
of O
those O

" O
, O
according O
to O

demanded O

to O
clarify O
the O
measures O
it O

studying O
to O
adopt O
in O
this O
matter O
, O
whether O
it O
will O
establish O
the O
obligation O
that O
the O

receive O
the O
documentation O
generated O

The O

The O

to O

that O

more O
" O
convincing O
force O

than O
the O
one O
offered O
by O

, O
defined O
as O
" O
invasive O

full O
of O
incongruencies O
" O
. O

The O
accused O
argued O
in O
the O
trial O
that O
the O
relationships O
were O
consented O
and O
attributed O
the O
complaint O
to O
his O
ex O
- O
boyfriend O
’s O
resentment O
because O
he O
had O
just O
communicated O
his O
unilateral O
decision O
to O
break O
the O
relationship O
and O
return O
to O
his O
first O
wife O
, O
but O
the O
verdict O
considers O
that O
the O
only O
proof O
of O
such O
a O
“ O
imposed O
break O
” O
is O
the O
prosecutor O
’s O
statement O
. O

The O
sentence O
is O
also O
based O
on O
the O
numerous O
injuries O
that O
the O

suffered O
in O
being O
hit O
in O
the O
campsite O
, O
which O
produced O

" O
, O
for O
which O
the O
judges O
impose O
the O
prosecution O
six O

The O
judgment O
says O
that O
these O
" O

of O
violence O
" O
, O
although O
produced O
at O
a O
time O
prior O
to O
the O
sexual O
act O
, O
are O
a O
further O
proof O
of O
the O
lack O

the O
victim O
, O

it O

evident O
that O

violence O
required O

because O
the O

those O

in O

, O
" O
unreasonable O
for O

so O
he O

to O

Breast O
reconstruction O
, O
according O
to O
each O
patient O
, O
can O
be O
carried O
out O
immediately O

after O

the O
disease O

oncological O
patient O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
are O
various O
surgical O
techniques O
to O
restore O
the O
breast O
, O
which O
are O
applied O
according O
to O
the O
physical O
characteristics O
of O
the O
patient O
, O
the O
type O
of O
cancer O
he O
suffers O
or O
the O
subsequent O
treatment O
that O
still O
awaits O
him O
. O

These O
techniques O
, O
on O
whose O
application O
the O
award O
- O
winning O
work O
extends O
, O
are O
basically O
divided O
into O
autologues O
, O
those O
in O
which O
the O
breast O
is O
reconstructed O
with O
tissues O
owned O
by O
the O
woman O
obtained O
from O
the O
back O
or O
abdomen O
, O
and O
those O
that O
use O
synthetic O
materials O
. O

Autologous O
techniques O
, O
according O
to O
the O
specialists O
, O
" O
have O
the O
advantage O
that O
they O
do O
not O
produce O
rejection O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
breast O
is O
owned O
by O
the O
woman O
and O
with O
the O
passage O
of O
time O
it O
smoothes O
to O
the O
changes O
that O
its O
physical O
record O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
the O
patient O
gets O
fat O
, O
the O
reconstructed O
breast O
is O
also O
enlarged O
. O
” O

However O
, O
the O
negative O
part O
" O
is O
that O
it O
leaves O
visible O
sequences O
there O
where O
we O
have O
gone O
in O

of O

we O
have O
improved O

The O
reconstruction O

of O

an O
alternative O

that O
“ O
do O
not O
leave O
any O
sequences O
in O

parts O

the O
body O

esthetically O
give O
a O

recalled O
that O

shown O
its O

knowing O
the O

González B-PER
Ballesta I-PER
explained O
that O

there O

that O

In O

Isabel B-PER
Salazar I-PER
began O
clarifying O
that O

be O
made O
of O

would O
prescribe O

that O
it O
would O
not O
be O
the O
case O

heroin O
” O
, O
nor O
the O
aforementioned O
“ O

Salazar B-PER
insisted O
on O
the O
need O
to O
end O

that O
they O
also O

The O

joined O

its O

Members O

by O
ZANU B-ORG
militants O
against O
the O

following O
the O

which O

some O
1,300 O

“ O

The O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
decided O
to O
open O
the O
case O
against O
the O
fiscal O
aid O
systems O
established O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
Navarra B-LOC
on O
14 O
July O
1999 O
and O
, O
although O
the O
decision O
does O
not O
imply O
the O
immediate O
condemnation O
of O
the O
same O
, O
it O
may O
in O
theory O
lead O
to O
the O
obligation O
to O
return O
the O
aid O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
Brussels B-LOC
made O
clear O
that O
it O
did O
not O
question O
the O
fiscal O
competences O
that O
both O
communities O
have O
thanks O
to O
the O
Guernica B-MISC
Statute I-MISC
and O
the O
Foral B-MISC
Statute I-MISC
of I-MISC
Navarra I-MISC
, O
but O
some O
measures O
of O
their O
regimes O
that O
it O
considered O
" O
discriminatory O
" O
and O
incompatible O
with O
European O
standards O
of O
free O
competition O
. O

The O
then O
Commissioner O
for O
Competition B-MISC
, O
Karel B-PER
van I-PER
Miert I-PER
, O
argued O
that O
Basque O
and O

has O
characteristics O
of O
" O
state B-ORG
aid O
" O
and O
" O
can O
be O
considered O
illegal O
" O
since O
" O
it O
is O
financed O
with O
public O
resources O
, O
favors O
certain O
companies O
, O
distorts O
competition O
and O
affects O
trade O
between O
Member O
States B-ORG
" O
. O

In O
the O
face O
of O
this O
opinion O
of O
the O
Commission B-ORG
, O
the O
president O
of O
Navarro O
said O
today O
that O
the O
tax O
aid O
of O
his O
community O
" O
in O
no O
case O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
state B-ORG
aid O
, O
since O
the O
four O
cases O
in O
which O
companies O
have O
opted O
for O
that O
type O
of O
tax O
aid O
have O
been O
able O
to O
deduct O
from O
the O
corporate O
tax O
a O
total O
of O
18 O
million O
pesetas O
" O
. O

Sanz B-PER
compared O
that O
amount O
to O
the O
528 O
million O
pesetas O
that O
, O
he O
said O
, O
those O
same O
companies O
could O
have O
saved O
if O
they O
had O
opted O
for O
direct O
aid O
to O
investment O
and O
employment O
on O
fixed O
assets O
: O
" O
but O
as O
our O
tax O
aid O
in O
exemptions O
from O
corporate O
tax O
are O
incompatible O
with O
direct O
aid O
, O
they O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
so O
and O
have O
been O
clearly O

Sanz B-PER
added O
that O

with O
the O

of O

of O

he O
trusts O
that O

the O

“ O
trues O

“ O
rescuing O

in O

the O

The O
French O
newspaper O
Le B-ORG

said O
today O
that O
this O
debate O
“ O
may O
seem O
surreal O
, O
several O
months O
after O
the O
human O
genome O
is O
deciphered O
. O
” O

For O
its O
part O
, O
the O
newspaper O
France B-ORG
Soir I-ORG
recalls O
that O
the O
researchers O
who O
deciphered O
the O
chromosome O
21 O
had O
already O
found O
fewer O
genes O
and O
that O
, O
by O
extrapolating O
it O
to O
the O
whole O
of O
human O
genetic O
heritage O
, O
they O
concluded O
that O
the O
man O
had O
40,000 O
genes O
. O

The O
results O
of O
the O
French O
scientists O
were O
obtained O
from O
the O
decoding O
of O
a O
fish O
, O
the O
" O
Tetraodon B-MISC
nigroviridis I-MISC

, O
400 O
million O
years O

the O
most O
complete O

of O

ever O
made O
, O
commented O
France B-ORG
Soir I-ORG
. O

According O
to O
Weissenbach B-PER
, O
“ O
before O
the O
end O
of O
this O
year O
90 O
percent O
of O
the O
human O
genetic O
heritage O
should O
be O
known O
and O
the O
controversy O
over O
the O
number O
of O
genes O
should O
then O
be O
calmed O
down O
. O
” O

The O
difference O
comes O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
once O
the O
DNA B-MISC
has O
been O
broken O
into O
pieces O
, O
it O
is O
not O
always O
known O
to O
gather O
the O
fragments O
of O
the O
same O

. O

Then O
you O
can O
count O
two O

this O

" O
Fortunately O
in O

it O
was O
possible O
to O
continue O
the O

the O

In O
his O

there O

it O
" O
offensive O
" O
for O
the O
Catholic O

to O
qualify O
the O
castrense O
institution O
as O
the O
" O

" O
of O
President O

In O

sent O
to O
the O

, O
Baltazar B-PER
Porras I-PER

and O
which O
today O

the O

notes O
that O
the O
representative O
of O

" O
underestimates O
and O
offends O
the O
National B-ORG

Forces I-ORG
" O
by O
questioning O
their O
democratic O

The O

Minister O
rejects O
the O

of O
“ O
Pretorian O
arm O
of O
the O
Government B-ORG
and O
Pretorianism O
” O
that O
Porras B-PER
attributed O
to O
the O
military O
institution O
. O

General O
Hurtado B-PER
recalls O
in O
his O
letter O
that O
in O
the O
castrenses O
there O
are O
many O
members O
of O
the O
Catholic O
Church B-ORG
who O
perform O
functions O
of O
military O
chaplains O

so O
he O
suggested O
that O
it O
be O
to O
them O
who O
are O
asked O
if O
they O
feel O
soldiers O
of O
an O
emperor O
. O

Hurtado B-PER
also O
titles O
" O
disrespectful O
" O
to O
speak O
of O
a O
supposed O
" O
fragility O
" O
of O
the O
Armed O

, O
because O
, O
he O
says O
, O
the O
men O

women O
who O
exercise O
their O
role O
of O
leaders O
within O
that O
armed O
institution O
allow O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
division O
. O

He O
also O
rejects O
the O
doubts O
expressed O
by O
Porras B-PER
about O
a O
supposed O
incapacity O
of O
the O
Armed O
Forces B-ORG
to O
guarantee O
the O
transparency O
of O
the O
election O

on O
Sunday O
, O
as O
for O

the O

be O
able O
to O

. O

The O
president O
of O
the O
Episcopal B-MISC
Conference I-MISC
said O
today O
that O
" O
it O
makes O
no O
sense O
" O
to O
fight O
two O
institutions O
of O
such O
prestige O
as O
the O
Catholic O
Church B-ORG
and O
the O
Armed B-ORG
Forces I-ORG
, O
which O
he O
attributed O
to O
interests O
that O
seek O
to O
divert O
attention O
on O
the O
electoral O
process O
. O

In O
this O
regard O
, O
Monsignor O
Roberto B-PER
Luckert I-PER
, O
bishop O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Coro B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
west O
of O
the O
country O
, O
assured O
that O
the O
Church B-ORG
has O
always O
been O
respectful O
of O
the O
armed O
institution O
, O
and O
clarified O
that O
what O
the O
letter O
of O
the O
bishops O
was O
intended O
to O
" O
warn O
" O
Hurtado B-PER
about O
what O
can O
be O
a O
" O
mismanagement O
" O
of O
the O
Armed B-ORG
Forces I-ORG
. O

The O
bishop O
nuanced O
that O
the O
qualification O
of O
" O
Pretorian O
guard O
" O
was O
only O
a O
warning O
for O
the O
Army B-ORG
not O
to O
become O
an O
elite O
and O
presidential O
personnel O
body O
. O

For O
Luckert B-PER
, O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
Catholic O
hierarchy O
's O
letter O
was O
to O
give O
a O
timely O
" O
scoron O
" O
to O
avoid O
a O
possible O
temptation O
to O
turn O
the O
military O
into O
a O
pretorian O
force O
and O
deviate O
them O
from O
their O
primary O
function O
that O
is O
to O
be O
guarantees O

On O

if O
it O

not O
to O
play O
in O
the O

it O
remains O
in O

there O

a O

play O

some O
of O

that O
they O
have O

from O

in O
the O

, O
" O
but O
nothing O
has O

so O
we O
will O
have O
to O
wait O

see O
how O
it O
all O
ends O
and O
then O
, O
if O
there O
is O
still O
interest O
, O
negotiate O
with O
the O
Elche B-ORG
, O
although O
the O

is O
very O
happy O

commented O

The O
clause O

of O
Mariano B-PER
Armentano I-PER
in O
the O
Elche B-ORG
rises O
to O
five O
hundred O
million O

, O
although O
the O
possibility O
of O
negotiating O
to O
the O
bottom O
the O
departure O
of O

would O
not O

out O

Diego B-PER
Quiles I-PER
, O
chief O
executive O
officer O
of O
the O
Elche B-ORG

has O
expressed O
in O
recent O
days O
his O
willingness O
to O
negotiate O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
Argentine O

with O
his O

, O
reduce O
the O

been O
generated O

In O
this O

situation O
is O
the O

Dani B-PER
Borreguero I-PER
, O
although O
he O
travels O
through O
a O
period O
of O
recovery O
from O
a O
serious O
injury O
- O
rupture O
of O

- O
so O
his O
exit O

more O
complex O
. O

This O
would O
not O
be O
the O
first O
time O
that O
the O
Elche B-ORG
sells O

to O
curb O
the O
deficit O
it O

also O

also O
transmitted O

, O
above O
all O

involved O

" O

" O
Because O

added O
that O
“ O

the O
debate O
that O

raised O

not O
who O

what O

something O
more O
profound O
: O
how O
to O
survive O
in O
a O

which O

, O
explained O
that O
just O
like O
in O
past O

not O

the O

due O
to O
the O
absence O

today O
there O
is O
an O

because O
the O

prevents O

He O
also O
added O
that O
the O
configuration O
of O
most O
of O
the O
current O

deprives O
its O

the O
critical O
sense O
, O
as O
they O

" O

" O
message O
, O
so O
it O
" O
does O
not O

opine O

" O

Jiménez B-PER

said O
that O
the O

investigate O
in O

the O
audience O
to O
which O
they O
are O
addressed O
, O
to O
transform O
the O
message O
according O
to O
their O
audience O
, O
which O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
large O

obliges O
to O
trivialize O
the O
contents O
, O
so O
that O
" O
everything O

, O
so O
that O
there O
is O
no O

. O

The O

harshly O
criticized O
the O

working O
for O
the O

, O
of O
whom O
he O
said O
they O
represent O
a O
reality O
in O
which O
“ O
the O
personal O
experience O
of O
the O
public O
serves O
nothing O
, O
with O
which O
it O
is O

it O
comes O
to O
the O
idiotic O
. O
” O

Jiménez B-PER
Lozano I-PER
noted O
that O
with O
this O
way O
of O
thinking O
is O
suppressed O
the O
individual O
to O
go O
to O
the O
“ O
adulation O
of O
the O

” O
, O
and O
added O
that O
they O
are O
present O
in O
the O

“ O
who O
speak O
louder O
, O
have O
greater O
skill O
or O
imagination O
to O

so O
” O
, O
above O
the O
importance O
of O
what O
they O
have O
to O

. O

For O
the O
writer O
Abulense O
, O
the O
relations O
between O
journalism O
and O
classical O
culture O
have O
always O
been O
misleading O
, O
because O
" O
the O

he O
did O
not O

That O

According O

the O

The O

98,000 O

an O

I O
think O
it O

that O

the O

" O
when O
you O

“ O
Now O
the O
goal O

to O
consolidate O
the O

the O
First B-MISC

and O
I O

responded O
to O

no O

it O

for O

Regarding O

The O

to O
which O
Efe B-ORG
had O
access O

reports O
up O
to O
twelve O
operations O
that O
the O
prosecuted O
person O
signed O

In O
one O
of O

the O

according O

acquired O
a O

sold O
it O

two O

one O

paid O
him O
more O

eight O
million O

The O
acts O
of O
the O
accused O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Audience B-ORG
, O
evidenced O
that O
" O
the O
defraudatory O

was O
present O

the O

not O

" O
Most O
of O
the O
injured O
were O
people O
who O
either O
sold O
their O

because O
they O

it O
notes O
that O

since O
they O
do O
not O

the O

This O
situation O
, O
according O

the O

is O
not O
a O

that O
all O

However O
, O
he O
recommended O
the O

to O
inform O
students O
of O
the O
need O
that O
, O
before O
they O
enroll O

a O

, O
they O
are O
informed O
whether O
it O
is O
validable O

for O
what O
qualification O
, O
and O
even O
that O
they O
can O
have O
a O
relationship O

so O
that O
they O
are O
valid O
as O
credits O
of O

. O

In O

he O
also O

that O

a O

The O
Stockholm B-ORG

a O

freeze O

following O
a O

This O

Eurobank B-ORG

soon O

notified O
by O

, O
but O
wanted O
to O
take O
the O
matter O
away O
, O
which O
they O
called O
" O
very O

" O

They O
also O
stated O
that O
the O

not O
prevent O

eventually O
received O

They O
recalled O
that O
the O

appeal O

that O

Switzerland B-ORG

elaborated O
by O

The O
extremeño O

indicated O
that O

constitute O
a O
key O
piece O
in O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
Health B-MISC
Model I-MISC
of I-MISC
Extremadura I-MISC
" O
and O
therefore O
- O
he O
said O
- O
we O
will O
pact O
with O
them O
, O
having O
clear O
that O
pact O
means O
negotiating O
goals O
, O
especially O
because O
a O
hospital O
can O
not O
work O
eight O
. O
three O
as O
they O
are O
doing O
now O
" O
. O

" O
Because O
otherwise O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
" O
everyone O
should O
be O
at O
eight O
in O
perfect O
magazine O
state O
, O
and O
they O
're O
not O
, O
and O
of O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
go O
behind O
with O
a O
list O
seeing O
at O
what O
time O
people O
arrive O
because O
I O
think O
that O
model O
has O
failed O
outright O
. O
" O

He O
assured O
that O
the O
final O
purposes O
of O
that O
pact O
are O
that O
professionals O
be O
held O
accountable O
for O
concrete O
goals O
" O
and O
then O
it O
will O
give O
us O
no O
difference O
if O
they O
meet O
them O
in O
seven O
. O
in O
eight O
hours O
" O
and O
that O
the O
division O
between O
management O
and O
clinic O
is O
broken O
" O
not O
as O
now O
that O
it O
seems O
that O
management O
is O
responsibility O
of O
some O
and O
assistance O
of O
others O
" O
. O

Fernández B-PER
Vara I-PER
asserted O
that O
in O
the O
Health B-MISC
Model I-MISC
of I-MISC
Extremadura I-MISC
should O
primarily O
the O
competition O
and O
not O
the O
competitiveness O
, O
" O
since O
- O
said O
- O
public O
health O
should O
not O
compete O
with O
anyone O
" O
. O

He O
added O
that O
in O
order O
to O
be O
competitive O
and O
that O
people O
do O
not O
go O
to O
private O
healthcare O
“ O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
give O
not O
only O
a O
better O
treatment O
to O
diseases O
but O
a O
better O
treatment O
to O
people O
” O
. O

The O
counselor O
stated O
that O
if O
among O
all O
social O
agents O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
design O
a O
model O
" O
which O
is O
probably O
not O
the O
one O
that O
we O
all O
individually O
want O
but O
the O
one O
that O
we O
understand O
as O
the O
least O
bad O
or O
the O
best O
, O
this O
will O
be O
a O
good O
starting O
point O
" O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
he O
pointed O
out O
that O
political O
leaders O
have O
the O
obligation O
to O
speak O
to O
people O
with O
clarity O
“ O
letting O
clear O
that O

many O
things O

that O

The O
national O

played O
a O
bad O
match O
, O
despite O
having O
carried O
out O
several O
changes O
during O
the O
game O
time O
and O
having O
put O
on O
the O
track O
all O
its O
available O
players O
. O

In O
the O
first O
set O
, O
Spain B-LOC
was O
very O
loose O
in O
the O
reception O
and O
was O
overtaken O
at O
all O
times O
by O
a O
Slovakia B-ORG
that O
demonstrated O
its O
quality O
on O
the O
track O
and O
that O
gave O
a O
great O
lesson O
in O
blocking O
the O
Spanish O
players O
. O

In O
the O
match O
, O
the O
Slovak O
national O
team O
came O
to O
score O
five O
direct O
draw O
points O
, O
through O
their O
player O
Kravaric B-PER
, O
which O
made O
it O
impossible O
to O
dream O
of O
a O
rebound O
by O
the O
Spanish O
team O
and O
was O
sublime O
in O
attack O
, O
thus O
mitigating O
the O
aspirations O
of O
the O
national O
team O
. O

The O
second O
set O
, O
which O
ended O
with O
a O
25 O
- O
23 O
in O
the O
scoring O
, O
was O
more O
equalized O
because O
Spain B-ORG
improved O
notably O
in O
its O
reception O

De B-PER

's O
departure O
to O
the O

was O
an O
important O
point O
, O
as O
it O
returned O
the O
lost O
concentration O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Spanish O
team O
remained O
very O
irregular O
and O
wasted O
a O
lot O
of O
balls O
that O
they O
threw O
out O
of O
the O
pitch O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
another O
of O
the O
black O
points O
of O
the O

combined O
was O
in O
the O
blockade O
, O
where O
he O
only O
managed O
to O
make O
two O
against O
the O
eleven O
of O
the O
Slovak O
national O
team O
. O

In O
the O
third O
set O
, O
which O
followed O
the O
same O
line O
of O
mistakes O
as O
the O
two O
previous O
ones O
, O
he O
highlighted O
the O
presence O
on O
the O
track O
of O
Guillermo B-PER
Falazca I-PER
, O
who O
came O
out O
instead O
of O

the O

part O

the O

The O

the O

that O

to O
find O
them O
the O

“ O

One O
of O
the O

precisely O
the O

it O

, O
much O
of O
these O

" O
Fortunately O

according O
to O
Castellano B-PER

everything O

remained O

a O
shock O

since O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
collapse O
, O
about O
eight O
in O

there O
were O
four O

in O
the O
room O
cleaning O
the O

Possibly O
the O

the O

the O

of O
three O
of O
