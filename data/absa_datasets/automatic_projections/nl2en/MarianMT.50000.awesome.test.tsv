We O
had O
a O
really O
good O
meal O
here. O

Although O
I O
read O
in O
advance O
that O
the O
chef O
determines O
what O
you O
eat, O
this O
is O
not O
correct O
or O
the O
restaurant O
has O
adapted O
this. O

There O
was O
a O
menu B-TARGET
either O
3 O
courses O
or O
4 O
courses O
each O
with O
3 O
to O
4 O
choices O
per O
corridor. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
more O
than O
enough, O
especially O
since O
the O
restaurant O
is O
known O
for O
its O
Wagyu O
cattle O
and O
Mangalica O
pigs, O
then O
these O
options O
are O
usually O
chosen. O

If O
one O
is O
not O
a O
meat O
lover, O
there O
is O
always O
a O
fish O
option. O

Summary: O
good O
service, B-TARGET
tasty O
(higher O
level) O
food B-TARGET
and O
nice O
location. B-TARGET

All O
this O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price! O

Ministry: B-TARGET
Running O
your O
business O
by O
inexperienced O
job O
students O
is O
never O
a O
good O
thing. O

Clearly O
undermanned, O
waiting O
far O
too O
long O
for O
water, O
bread, O
wine O
list... O

No O
knowledge O
of O
the O
wine O
list, O
let O
alone O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
per O
glass O
(extremely O
limited O
VAT). O

Food: B-TARGET
Weird O
combinations, O
appetizer B-TARGET
in O
advance O
does O
not O
stimulate O
appetite O
(too O
spicy O
and O
too O
complex). O

First O
course O
was O
not O
refined, O
fried B-TARGET
squid I-TARGET
that O
was O
dominated O
by O
too O
fat O
batter. O

Wildvang B-TARGET
gamba I-TARGET
was O
okay O
but O
tom.saus B-TARGET
was O
too O
dominant. O

Main O
dish O
was O
dorade B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
salt I-TARGET
crust, I-TARGET
very O
good, O
correct, O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
it. O

Lamsossobuco... B-TARGET
it O
was O
lamb O
bolt... O
be O
honest O
with O
you. O

Conclusion: O
I O
expected O
much O
more O
given O
the O
reputation. O

Price O
quality O
ratio O
seems O
ok O
but O
put O
experienced O
staff B-TARGET
in O
the O
room O
and O
improve O
your O
personal O
touch O
with O
the O
neighborhood. O

I O
don't O
think O
I'll O
be O
back O
soon. O

Cozy O
tables O
in O
a O
bistro B-TARGET
with O
pleasant O
atmosphere. O

The O
Royal B-TARGET
all I-TARGET
including I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
taken O
at O
a O
democratic O
price O
of O
42€. O

Amuse, O
appetizer, O
sorbet, O
main O
course O
and O
dessert O
plate O
from O
the O
chef. O

This O
with O
water O
and O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine O
per O
person. O

Highly O
recommended, O
where O
the O
steak B-TARGET
Rossini I-TARGET
was O
perfectly O
baked O
and O
very O
tender. O

I'll O
definitely O
come O
back O
here. O

Of O
course O
also O
a O
la O
carte O
possible. O

You O
can O
also O
have O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
terrace. O

Restaurant O
de O
Zuiderpeel O
is O
closed O
and O
has O
made O
a O
start O
as O
café O
brasserie. O

This O
means O
that O
they O
have O
lost O
a O
lot O
of O
quality O
without O
the O
new O
concept O
of O
cosiness, O
low-threshold, O
bistro O
kitchens. O

Small O
but O
cozy O
business B-TARGET
with O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

Limited O
card B-TARGET
but O
very O
tasty! O

We O
took O
an O
appetizer, O
main O
course O
and O
dessert O
and O
everything O
was O
perfect! O

The O
price O
was O
also O
not O
so O
bad O
(about O
60 O
euros O
per O
person-wine O
and O
coffee O
included) O

Unfortunately, O
they're O
only O
open O
every O
week. O

(Nevertheless O
best O
reservation) O

Control B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
very O
nice O
trendy O
retro B-TARGET
interior. I-TARGET

Teaser B-TARGET
(hot O
drink O
with O
maltesers) O
very O
tasty. O

Good O
price/quality O
+ O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

Suggest! O

Already O
for O
the O
second O
time O
a O
guest O
in O
this O
case. O

Once O
again O
we O
were O
made O
culinary O
and O
we O
could O
enjoy O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
presented O
as O
artwork. O

All O
this O
overflowed O
with O
a O
little O
dry O
humor O
and O
the O
original O
concept, B-TARGET
making O
this O
case B-TARGET
one O
of O
my O
favorites! O

Culinary O
top O
level O
for O
a O
fair O
price! O

My O
favorite! O

Pure O
pleasure O
from O
beginning O
to O
end... O

Fantastic O
taste O
bombs O
with O
surprising O
structures O
and O
combinations...Each O
dish B-TARGET
is O
a O
work O
of O
art. O

Pure O
class! O

I O
also O
love O
the O
touch O
of O
humor O
that O
you O
can O
discover O
anywhere. O

An O
experience O
you O
like O
to O
think O
back O
to O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
crave O
for O
the O
next O
reservation. O

Interior B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
this O
restaurant O
are O
fine. O

The O
controls B-TARGET
are O
correct O
but O
could O
be O
better. O

We O
did O
not O
find O
the O
typical O
Thai O
kindness O
and O
cordiality O
here. O

We O
ate O
the O
Discovery O
menu O
(via O
a O
Groupon O
receipt). O

Based O
on O
what O
we O
were O
given, O
we O
wouldn't O
like O
to O
pay O
the O
full O
price. O

Rather O
small O
portions B-TARGET
(which O
may O
still O
be O
acceptable O
given O
the O
receipt), O
food B-TARGET
was O
rather O
lukewarm O
instead O
of O
warm. O

It O
was O
certainly O
fresh O
but O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
rather O
faint. O

We O
got O
a O
Groupon O
ticket O
to O
this O
restaurant. O

Had O
signed O
on O
to O
a O
Discovery O
set O
menu. O

The O
food B-TARGET
in O
itself O
was O
very O
tasty O
but O
we O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
the O
action O
to O
- O
approximately- O
half O
of O
the O
price O
included O
only O
half O
of O
the O
normal O
portion. B-TARGET

It O
was O
so O
little O
that O
we O
went O
out O
very O
disappointed, O
even O
the O
promotional O
prize O
seemed O
a O
lot O
for O
what O
we O
got. O

I'm O
not O
a O
big O
eater O
but O
it O
was O
just O
ridiculously O
little, O
I O
think O
there O
was O
not O
a O
total O
of O
100g O
meat/chicken/scampi B-TARGET
to O
be O
found. O

And O
then O
a O
little O
soup O
bowl O
of O
rice, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
for O
both O
of O
us. O

(the O
photo O
on O
the O
site O
of O
the O
discoverymenu O
is O
correct, O
only O
it O
seems O
there O
as O
if O
you O
get O
that O
per O
person O
instead O
of O
per O
two). O

Ate O
here O
last O
Friday. O

It O
was O
very O
good O
again. O

It's O
gonna O
be O
okay. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
nice O

good O

But O
also O
(only O
if O
you O
have O
reserved) O
very O
good, O
tasty, O
extensive O
breakfast. B-TARGET

Price O
quality O
ratio O
very O
good. O

Very O
friendly O
attentive O
staff. B-TARGET

When O
the O
weather O
is O
good, O
sit O
outside. O

We'll O
be O
back. O

If O
you O

Delicious. O

It's O
always O
a O
party O
to O
eat O
here. O

For O
50 O
euros O
you O
can O
enjoy O
the O
fantastic O
Thai B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
the O
personal O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
cozy O
home O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

First O
an O
aperitif O
in O
the O
beautiful O
garden B-TARGET
and O
then O
we O
were O
surprised O
with O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

Especially O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
could O
charm O
us O
very O
much. O

Definitely O
recommended... O
with O
2 O
or O
in O
group. O

Make O
a O
reservation! O

fantastic O
tasty, O
wonderful O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
unique O
combinations, O
smooth O
but O
no O
stiff O
operation. B-TARGET

Only O
downside O
was O
the O
noisy O
frame. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
very O
noisy O
group O
next O
to O
us O
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
didn't O
provide O
enough O
dampening O
which O
sometimes O
made O
it O
difficult O
for O
me O
to O
understand O
each O
other. O

Furthermore, O
it's O
quite O
pricey, O
but O
you O
get O
absolutely O
value O
for O
money. O

Highly O
recommended! O

Yesterday O
we O
went O
to O
Ninove O
to O
test O
the O
three O
of O
us O
and O
we O
were O
all O
very O
satisfied. O

Was O
very O
tasty O
and O
very O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
we O
certainly O
still O
do O
this. O

Hopefully O
many O
other O
people O
will O
discover O
this O
place! O

In O
September O
they O
start O
with O
buffet O
form, O
we O
will O
definitely O
taste O
everything! O

Highly O
recommended! O

Going O
out O
for O
a O
nice O
Indian O
dinner O
like O
in O
London. O

Order O
a O
soup B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables: I-TARGET
just O
a O
bad O
minestrone O
with O
floating O
vegetable O
cubes O
in O
a O
blurry O
moisture. O

And O
then O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
again O
and O
in O
the O
meantime O
your O
drink O
is O
already O
gone O
and O
no O
one O
has O
seen O
it. O

And O
finally, O
the O
main O
course O
came. O

A O
real O
disappointment O
in O
terms O
of O
weight O
and O
taste. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
serve O
Indian O
do O
it O
the O
Indian O
way O
with O
many O
small O
dishes O
in O
jars O
and O
some O
naân O
and O
like O
spicy O
rice. O

An O
Indian O
menu O
can't O
consist O
of O
soup, O
appetizer, O
main O
course, O
dessert O
like O
Western O
cuisine. O

Try O
to O
stay O
original! O

I O
have O
to O
be O
honest, O
this O
is O
the O
least O
good O
animal B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
eaten. O

There O
is O
never O
any O
people, O
which, O
of O
course, O
is O
a O
sign. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
a O
receipt. O

We O
got O
enough, O
though, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
really O
very O
tasteful. O

Friendly O
service, B-TARGET
the O
operator B-TARGET
is O
always O
willing O
to O
make O
a O
chat O
even O
when O
it O
is O
busy. O

The O
controls B-TARGET
are O
very O
smooth. O

You O
never O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
for O
tasty O
fries. B-TARGET

Especially O
recommended, O
even O
if O
you O
want O
to O
sit O
quietly O
in O
the O
adjacent O
restaurant O
area. O

Good O
fry, B-TARGET
nowhere O
in O
Hasselt O
you O
can O
eat O
fries B-TARGET
at O
these O
prices. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
friendly, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
cozy. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
something O
can O
be O
done O
about O
the O
extraction O
system O
(if O
they O
already O
have O
one), O
if O
you O
are O
in O
there O
for O
5 O
minutes O
anyone O
can O
smell O
that O
you O
come O
from O
the O
Marmiet. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
better O
dishes B-TARGET
brought O
to O
democratic O
prices. O

Today O
we're O
going O
to O
try O
mussels. O

More O
later. O

The O
tapas B-TARGET
in O
advance O
were O
a O
direct O
hit. O

The O
chef O
serves O
the O
appropriate O
beers O
with O
each O
dish. O

We O
let O
the O
wine O
pass O
us O
by O
today. O

Extraordinary O
reception O
by O
a O
lovely O
hostess. B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
small O
but O
very O
cozy O
restaurant, B-TARGET
you O
absolutely O
have O
to O
reserve. O

The O
card B-TARGET
changes O
regularly O
and O
is O
small. O

I O
always O
find O
that O
an O
advantage O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
come O
on O
the O
table O
are O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
delightfully O
accompanied O
by O
the O
excellent O
wine O
advice O
of O
the O
hostess. B-TARGET

This O
is O
pure O
pampering. O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
very O
cozy, O
eat B-TARGET
really O
top O
level. O

with O
a O
receipt O
to O
la O
vache O
qui O
suisse. O

After O
many O
disappointments O
with O
vouchers O
we O
have O
eaten O
very O
well O
here, O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
original, O
e.g. O
the O
potatoes B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
peel I-TARGET
in O
a O
jutte O
bag, O
nice!!! O

we O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
here O
again O
for O
a O
cheese O
fondue O
-smoke O
also O
very O
tasty O

You'll O
get O
what O
you O
can O
expect. O

Nice O
fondue, B-TARGET
good O
service. B-TARGET

There's O
nothing O
to O
notice. O

Of O
course O
more O
fun O
in O
the O
winter O
months O
than O
in O
the O
summer, O
quite O
weeds O

Had O
been O
in O
the O
Orangerie O
a O
few O
years O
ago. O

Never O
again! O

Scampi B-TARGET
in O
a O
thick O
floral O
sauce O
no O
flavor. O

Steak B-TARGET
bearnaise: I-TARGET
sauce O
was O
too O
thick O
and O
too O
cold O
to O
pour O
over O
the O
meat. O

That's O
disgusting. O

Even O
from O
a O
pot, O
it's O
better. O

Frieds B-TARGET
had O
a O
weird O
aftertaste. O

Girlfriend O
had O
a O
stew B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cod I-TARGET
there O
you O
could O
put O
a O
fork O
in O
right. O

Staff B-TARGET
friendly, O
but O
had O
to O
decide O
quickly O
what O
we O
wanted O
although O
there O
was O
only O
one O
other O
couple O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Never O
again!!!. O

110 O
euros O
paid O
for O
what O
you O
wouldn't O
get O
in O
a O
fry O
yet. O

Very O
good O
location B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
nonchalant O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
slow. O

If O
the O
case O
is O
full O
then O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
- O
which O
translates O
into O
slow O
operation B-TARGET
and O
errors. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
nicoise I-TARGET
is O
really O
not O
a O
topper O
-just O
some O
canned O
tuna O
with O
lettuce, O
without O
much O
inspiration. O

Too O
bad, O
because O
for O
the O
price O
requested O
you O
really O
expect O
more. O
of O
this O
nice O
business. B-TARGET

And O
delicious O
food O
too! O

We O
followed O
the O
waiter's O
recommendation: O
the O
flat B-TARGET
oysters I-TARGET
are O
inside O
and O
they O
were O
indeed O
delicious. O

House O
of O
Elliott, O
Grade O
and O
others. O

The O
service O
by O
young O
waiters B-TARGET
could O
also O
be O
more O
professional. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
will O
be O
called O
'excited', O
it O
is O
cold, O
offers O
only O
a O
moderate O
'hotel O
atmosphere'. O

Except O
for O
the O
neatly O
stitched O
napkins, O
there O
was O
no O
dust O
on O
the O
tables. O

In O
a O
restaurant O
like O
le O
Grand O
Bleu O
this O
is O
a O
style O
characteristic, O
given O
the O
lived-in O
style: O
old O
tables, O
mix O
of O
types O
of O
chairs O
etc. O

Here O
it O
leaves O
a O
cold O
impression, O
in O
combination O
with O
moderate O
execution O
of O
the O
dishes... O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
I O
as O
a O
bourgonian O
with O
an O
eye O
for O
the O
fine O
cuisine O
still O
ignores O
me O
in O
the O
future. O

Much O
ado O
about O
nothing! O

We O
had O
reserved O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
upon O
arrival O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
lookout O
for O
a O
table. O

Table B-TARGET
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
kitchen O
windows, O
intimate O
dinner O
with O
two, O
stationed O
next O
to O
noisy O
Aalwestern O
group O
(not O
really O
ideal). O

Aperitif B-TARGET
Hugo, I-TARGET
very O
tasty, O
nicely O
presented. O

Early O
3 O
course O
menu O
+ O
glass O
white O
with O
starter O
and O
glass O
red O
with O
main O
course. O

We've O
never O
seen O
the B-TARGET
latter... I-TARGET

Little B-TARGET
bite I-TARGET
(to O
be O
shared) O
was O
very O
tasty, O
beef O
starter. O

First B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
(st O
jacob O
fruit) O
I O
didn't O
find O
convincing O
and O
cold O
enough O
to O
be O
cold O
starter O
and O
a O
little O
too O
lukewarm O
to O
be O
hot O
starter... O

Main B-TARGET
dish O
(duck) O
was O
ok O
of O
flavor O
(sauce B-TARGET
was O
good) O
but O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
not O
crispy O
baked O
and O
duck O
was O
tough. O

Dessert B-TARGET
was O
disappointing, O
METEEN O
came O
after O
main O
course O
and O
the O
chocolate O
that O
was O
included O
in O
the O
description O
was O
not O
to O
be O
found. O

Personally O
I O
was O
somewhat O
disappointed O
in O
the O
price/quality. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty, O
fast O
service, B-TARGET
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly!! O

Top O
restaurant;-) B-TARGET

The O
appearance O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
looks O
simple, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
absolutely O
not! O

Card B-TARGET
is O
special O
because O
of O
the O
large O
amount O
of O
pizzas. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly. O

I'm O
a O
big O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
fan O
anyway, O
so O
I've O
had O
ice O
cream O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
places, O
but O
this O
is O
really O
the O
best O
ice O
cream O
I've O
ever O
had! O

Mmmmmm... O

I'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
next O
visit! O

During O
my O
studies O
in O
Leuven, O
I O
saw O
Decadanza O
grow O
into O
a O
popular O
ice O
cream O
store. O

Now O
I O
live O
in O
Berlin O
and O
every O
time O
I O
get O
back O
to O
Belgium O
I O
hurry O
to O
Leuven O
for O
a O
full-bodied O
real O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
from O
Decadanza. O

Best O
I've O
had O
so O
far! O

Good O
price O
and O
quality. O

Control B-TARGET
for O
Belgian O
concepts O
very O
good. O

Wide O
choice O
on O
the O
map B-TARGET
with O
lots O
of O
variation. O

Eat O
in O
an O
almost O
empty O
restaurant O
(4 O
tables O
occupied). O

That's O
okay O
in O
itself, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
more O
involved O
with O
each O
other O
than O
with O
the O
guests. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
very O
long O
before O
there O
was O
cleared O
and O
recorded O
for O
dessert. O

The O
music B-TARGET
that O
absolutely O
doesn't O
fit O
in O
a O
restaurant O
was O
suddenly O
loudened O
during O
dinner. O

Pins O
with O
a O
nl O
debit O
card O
was O
not O
possible. O

Credit O
card O
was O
not O
accepted O
either. O

Delicious O
food O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price. O

The O
ham B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
mustard I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
a O
abundant O
piece O
of O
tender O
meat O
with O
a O
crispy O
salad. O

The O
homemade O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
as O
dessert O
was O
just O
added. O

We'll O
be O
back! O

We O
ate O
the O
barrel B-TARGET
handles I-TARGET
at O
30€, O
they O
were O
tasteless O
and O
very O
small O
(4 O
chunks). O

Also O
the O
wine, B-TARGET
14€ O
for O
a O
small O
1/2L, O
was O
nothing. O

Apparently, O
and O
hopefully, O
you'll O
be O
better O
served O
here O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
meat. O

Person O
X O

A O
concept O
in O
Leuven O
with O
the O
classic O
Italian B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
with O
some O
adjustments O
for O
the O
Belgian O
gourmets. O

Probably O
has O
been O
around O
for O
50 O
years O
and O
is O
still O
loyal O
to O
himself. O

I O
passed O
there O
every O
day O
and O
saw O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
there, O
so O
I O
thought O
I'd O
go O
in. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
ok, O
interior B-TARGET
pretty O
boring O
and O
old. O

Dinner B-TARGET
was O
a O
disappointment. O

For O
example, O
Vispanje B-TARGET
was O
cold O
and O
not O
fresh O
at O
all. O

For O
that O
price O
you O
can O
eat O
much O
better O
in O
Leuven O
if O
you O
know O
the O
good O
places. O

I O
can't O
say O
it O
was O
great, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
bad O
either. O

Both O
for O
service O
and O
food. O

I O
think O
it's O
a O
little O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
got. O

Very O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

Plates B-TARGET
not O
washed O
clean, O
look O
greasy. O

Stew B-TARGET
exactly O
from O
the O
fry. O

Fried B-TARGET
from O
the O
freezer O
bags.. O

Definitely O
not O
worth O
money! O

What O
a O
disappointment. O

Very O
tasty O
tabled. O

Price O
quality O
excellent. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Ham O
with O
mustard O
sauce. O

The O
water's O
coming O
back O
to O
me O
in O
the O
mouth. O

For O
me, O
restaurant B-TARGET
Zeno I-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
top O
addresses O
in O
Bruges. O

What O
you're O
getting O
there O
borders O
on O
the O
unbelievable! O

From O
the O
amuses O
to O
the O
delicacies O
with O
the O
coffee, O
everything O
is O
top! O

We O
already O
had O
dinner O
three O
times O
at O
Zeno B-TARGET
and O
each O
time O
it O
was O
a O
culinary O
direct O
hit. O

Even O
if O
you O
take O
the O
cheaper O
menu O
during O
the O
week, O
the O
same O
amuses O
and O
mignardises O
are O
served O
as O
with O
the O
big O
menu. O

The O
only O
downside O
for O
me O
is O
the O
cold O
interior, B-TARGET
but O
that O
won't O
stop O
me O
from O
going O
to O
Zeno. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
smooth O
and O
friendly O
operation B-TARGET
it O
is O
very O
pleasant. O

Zeno B-TARGET
is O
highly O
recommended O
and O
certainly O
worthy O
of O
a O
Michelin O
star. O

Last O
night O
delicious O
food O
at O
this O
restaurant! O

It's O
a O
bit O
from O
the O
center, O
so O
it's O
not O
full O
of O
tourists. O

It O
was O
full O
of O
bombs, O
but O
luckily O
we O
had O
reservations. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
to O
do O
a O
bite O
here, O
call O
ahead. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
nicely O
furnished. O

It O
looks O
like O
you're O
going O
back O
years O
in O
time. O

Nice O
background O
music, O
everywhere O
things O
on O
the O
wall O
and O
great O
chairs. O

We O
were O
helped O
by O
a O
nice O
and O
spontaneous O
woman! B-TARGET

Respect O
for O
her, B-TARGET
walking O
on O
your O
own O
eleven O
tables O
is O
quite O
a O
challenge. O

She O
didn't O
come O
across O
in O
a O
hurry O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
took O
her O
time O
for O
everyone. O

We O
had O
chosen O
mussels O
and O
a O
steak O
tartare. O

It O
tasted O
delicious O
and O
the O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
totally O
good! O

I O
can O
highly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
everyone. O

Excellent O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
chose O
the O
Flemish B-TARGET
casserole I-TARGET
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
great. O

A O
very O
generous O
serving B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
Belgian B-TARGET
fries! I-TARGET

The O
well-priced O
house B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
which O
was O
recommended, O
fits O
perfectly. O

Extremely O
friendly O
operation. B-TARGET

It O
is O
located O
a O
bit O
outside O
the O
center, O
but O
the O
walk O
is O
rewarded O
with O
a O
very O
good O
meal. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended, O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

X O
and O
Y O

Nice O
dinner. O

Very O
thoughtful O
and O
friendly O
operation. B-TARGET

Here O
I O
would O
eat O
a O
second O
time O
without O
thinking. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
also O
recommended. O

Bruges O
is O
a O
beautiful O
city. O

The O
ribs B-TARGET
were O
good! O

Staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
good O
service. O

Nacho's B-TARGET
in O
advance O
very O
tasty O
(and O
many, O
small O
portion B-TARGET
is O
easy O
to O
eat O
with O
3 O
people). O

Meat B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
tasty. O

Pre-reservation!! O

Here O
the O
perfection O
is O
pursued! O

Delicious O
pastries B-TARGET
and O
bread B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
raisins I-TARGET
is O
perfect!! O

Friendly O
service, B-TARGET
and O
top O
patissier!!!! B-TARGET

super O
tasty, O
super O
fresh, O
original O
patisserie B-TARGET
with O
super O
friendly O
operation, B-TARGET
that's O
all O
there O
is O
to O
it...and O
as O
for O
the O
price, O
you O
pay O
for O
quality O
and O
in O
that O
sense O
they O
are O
even O
cheap:-) O

Books B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
fantastic! O

Breakfast B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
very O
fresh, O
spacious O
enough, O
wide O
choice, O
very O
tasty O
coffee B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
milk. I-TARGET

So O
the O
food's B-TARGET
great. O

The O
controls B-TARGET
are O
very O
smooth! O

The O
guest B-TARGET
lady I-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
spontaneous! O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is O
also O
fun! O

One O
sits O
cozy O
among O
the O
books O
that O
are O
nicely O
arranged. O

The O
books O
can O
also O
be O
purchased. O

Fun O
too! O

for O
Bruges, O
this O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
really O
an O
added O
value! O

Congratulations O
to O
the O
operators. O

We're O
glad O
we O
discovered O
Books B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Brunch!!! I-TARGET

Books B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
of O
the O
best O
Bruges O
has O
to O
offer. O

I O
discovered O
this O
place O
when O
it O
recently O
opened, O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
this O
cozy O
and O
atmospheric O
establishment, B-TARGET
and O
I O
still O
am. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is O
of O
course O
something O
unique O
in O
Bruges O
and O
something O
you O
always O
turn O
out O
to O
look O
through O
the O
books O
regardless O
of O
the O
reason O
for O
your O
visit. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
fresh, O
and O
you O
taste O
it's O
not O
forced. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
Books O
& O
Brunch O
is O
so O
delicious, O
you O
come O
for O
lunch, O
a O
coffee O
or O
a O
tea. O

There O
is O
an O
optimal O
cosiness, O
calmness O
and O
everything O
is O
not O
forced O
and O
done O
at O
ease O
without O
looking O
lax. O

Madam B-TARGET
President, O
I O
should O
like O
to O
say O
a O
word O
about O
the O
kindness O
of O
the O
House. O

Delicious O
place B-TARGET
to O
come O
to O
lunch O
with O
your O
girlfriend, O
mom O
or O
comrade O
or O
to O
just O
come O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
tea B-TARGET
or I-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
and O
browse O
a O
book O
or O
enjoy O
the O
free O
Wi-Fi O
with O
the O
MacBook O
or O
iPhone. O

Books B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
gem O
among O
all O
the O
tourist O
restaurants O
and O
cafes O
that O
dominate O
Bruges. O

Nice O
place, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
nice O
home-made B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
tea. I-TARGET

Only O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
so O
limited O
in O
terms O
of O
food, O
otherwise O
we O
also O
had O
a O
bite O
to O
eat. O

As O
vegetarians, O
it O
is O
anything O
but O
obvious O
to O
find O
a O
good O
restaurant, O
which O
one O
does O
not O
assume O
is O
that'vegetarian' O
simply O
means O
that O
you O
let O
the O
meat O
out. O

For O
all O
people O
with O
the O
same O
problem, O
here's O
the O
solution. O

After O
some O
searching O
on O
the O
internet O
we O
finally O
reserved O
here O
for O
the O
Sunday O
evening, O
with O
2 O

Eventually O
it O
wasn't O
crowded O
that O
night, O
but O
when O
I O
read O
the O
other O
reviews O
like O
that, O
it O
is O
still O
safer O
to O
book! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
sincere, O
and O
that O
is O
a O
lot O
more O
pleasant O
than O
too O
chic O
and O
forced. O

During O
the O
whole O
evening O
we O
were O
expressly O
asked O
whether O
everything O
was O
as O
desired, O
without O
imposing O
too O
much O
on O
the O
ministry. B-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
also O
provides O
a O
relaxing O
evening. O

We O
chose O
the O
vegetarian B-TARGET
four-course I-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
definitely O
worth O
it! O

The O
amuse O
was O
a O
tapenade B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
olives I-TARGET
and O
was O
really O
surprisingly O
tasty! O

Also O
we O
had O
already O
got O
some O
bread O
with O
olive O
oil, O
that O
within O
5 O
minutes. O

Always O
fun O
if O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
wait O
long! O

The O
two O
appetizers B-TARGET
were O
also O
appreciated, O
but O
especially O
the O
appetizer B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
coeur I-TARGET
de I-TARGET
boeuf I-TARGET
stayed O
with O
me! O

This O
was O
served O
with O
melon O
and O
is O
a O
very O
original O
vegetarian O
variant O
on O
the O
classic O
Spanish O
ham O
with O
melon. O

For O
the O
main O
course, O
the O
vegan B-TARGET
lasagna, I-TARGET
it O
is O
true O
again O
that O
here O
we O
do O
not O
assume O
'we O
just O
leave O
the O
meat O
out'. O

This O
was O
really O
a O
full-bodied O
dish, B-TARGET
and O
finished O
with O
a O
pesto O
made O
of B-TARGET
basil, I-TARGET
which O
was O
delicious O
enough O
to O
eat O
on O
its O
own. O

If O
dessert O
then O
chosen O
the O
vegan B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
and O
although O
it O
is O
indeed O
something O
quite O
different O
from O
what O
you O
expect, O
we O
were O
kindly O
warned O
before, O
it O
is O
highly O
recommended! O

Really O
a O
pure O
chocolate B-TARGET
flavor, I-TARGET
which O
goes O
super O
in O
combination O
with O
the O
orange O
slices O
served O
with O
it. O

In O
short, O
if O
you O
come O
out O
here, O
you've O
really O
eaten O
for O
your O
money. O

The O
spacious O
portions, B-TARGET
the O
welcoming O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
chef B-TARGET
who O
has O
clearly O
mastered O
cooking O
without O
meat O
or O
fish O
are O
worth O
the O
price. O

At O
least O
we'll O
come O
back O
here, O
maybe O
sometime O
to O
test O
the O
nice O
terrace? B-TARGET

Never O
again!!!!!, O
my O
animals O
get O
better O
food!!!!, O
only O
the O
money O
counts O
stay O
away O
and O
go O
elsewhere O
where O
it O
is O
definitely O
much O
better O
no O
price/quality!!!! O

That O
something B-TARGET
like O
this O
may O
still O
be O
open O
in O
our O
beautiful O
city, O
I O
don't O
understand. O

As O
bridge O
geling O
a O
shame O
to O
drink O
there. O

Coke B-TARGET
40cl O
€5,80, O
for O
the O
bridge O
geling O
€3, O
happy...... O

Jupiler B-TARGET
25cl O
€4.00 O
White B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
€7.00 O
Coffee B-TARGET
€2.50 O
this O
can O
even O
more O
or O
less O
be O
tolerated. O

Hopefully O
they O
don't O
talk O
to O
people O
about O
eating O
anything O
there O
because O
this O
is O
forbidden O
in O
Bruges. O

We're O
gonna O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
this. O

a O
pleasant O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
a O
small O
or O
extensive O
meal!! O

Very O

Tell O
him O
I O
said O
it!!!! O

The O
soup B-TARGET
from O
the O
day O
menu O
was O
stiff O
from O
the O
salt. O

A O
splash O
of O
warm O
water O
was O
offered O
as O
a O
solution. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
nice, O
but O
a O
rose O
broccoli O
was O
all O
vegetables. B-TARGET

When O
I O
was O
cleaning O
up, O
sauce O
was O
spilled O
over O
my O
clothes. O

No O
decent O
excuses O
or O
small O
compensation. O

Go O
around O
with O
a O
big O
bow. O

Never O
been O
in O
such O
a O
dirty O
and O
disorderly O
mcdonald's B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
certainly O
an O
aphrodisiac. O

They O
should O
close O
this O
case. B-TARGET

We O
went O
there O
to O
satisfy O
our O
hunger O
quickly, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
5 O
hamburgers: O
15-20 O
minutes. O

For O
the O
rest, O
we O
noticed O
that O
the O
whole O
price B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
(such O
as O
euro O
deals) O
was O
not O
clearly O
displayed O
somewhere. O

a O
very O
greasy O
and O
dirty O
business, B-TARGET
advertising O
for O
1.3 O
kilos O
is O
only O
600 O
grams O
everything O
there O
is O
only O
normal O
a O
0 O

I've O
noticed O
several O
times O
that O
the O
black-haired B-TARGET
lesbian I-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
doesn't O
return O
change O
by O
accident. O

Also O
at O
the O
table O
behind O
I O
heard O
the O
people O
advertising O
that O
they O
had O
gotten O
ten O
euros O
short O
back. O

This O
isn't O
a O
coincidence O
anymore. O

Lots O
of O
nostalgia O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
buttermilk O
stompers O
are O
on O
the O
map. O

Menu B-TARGET
at O
an O
attractive O
price. O

Many O
stairs O
aren't O
so O
convenient O
for O
people O
with O
locomotor O
problems. O

Very O
friendly O
people. B-TARGET

Since O
we O
have O
a O
second O
cottage O
in O
Knokke O
I O
am O
eagerly O
looking O
for O
a O
nice O
lunch O
restaurant/brasserie. O

Card B-TARGET
looked O
good, O
tables B-TARGET
neatly O
covered. O

Food B-TARGET
too O
expensive O
for O
what O
came O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
chicken B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
lettuce B-TARGET
could O
be O
a O
better O
mix O
and O
I O
just O
didn't O
like O
the O
fries. B-TARGET

The O
settlement O
took O
a O
long O
time O
while O
it O
wasn't O
crowded O
in O
the O
business. O

So O
we're O
gonna O
keep O
looking O
for O
a O
lunch O
address. O

friendly O
welcome, B-TARGET
busy O
this O
Saturday O
night. O

Menu B-TARGET
at O
very O
acceptable O
price. O

Shrimp B-TARGET
skirts I-TARGET
made O
in O
the O
house. O

Half B-TARGET
lobster, I-TARGET
a O
minimum O
of O
serving. O

Fast O
(too?) O
operation. B-TARGET

We O
got O
what O
we O
expected, O
but O
we O
didn't O
get O
it O
anymore. O

The O
lunch B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
price-quality O
very O
good. O

Good O
choice B-TARGET
and O
large O
portions. B-TARGET

Shrimp B-TARGET
crockery I-TARGET
where O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
look O
for O
the O
shrimp. O

Friendly O
service, B-TARGET
and O
tasty O
olives B-TARGET
at O
the O
apero O
;) O

In O
short: O
really O
highly O
recommended O
and O
worth O
repeating. O

During O
the O
fireworks O
festival O
in O
Knokke O
it O
is O
always O
busy. O

The O
terrace O
of O
the O
Lodge O
is O
also O
well O
filled. O

When O
finding O
a O
place O
we O
are O
promptly O
desired O
success O
by O
our O
table O
neighbours. O

When O
we O
called O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
he O
came O
to O
take O
our O
order, O
but O
when O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
we O
were O
new O
clients, O
he O
canceled O
the O
recorded O
order O
and O
told O
us O
that O
he O
will O
first O
serve O
his O
existing O
clients O
before O
he O
serves O
us. O

When O
calling O
for O
a O
second O
waiter, B-TARGET
we O
had O
even O
less O
success O
because O
this O
one O
does O
not O
know O
the O
Dutch O
language O
and O
ran O
there O
for O
bacon O
and O
beans. O

After O
a O
fifteen O
minutes O
of O
patience O
having O
seen O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
of O
the O
evening, O
and O
the O
remarkably O
undermanned O
staff O
and O
already O
have O
4 O
tables O
to O
leave O
again, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
comes O
to O
clean O
up O
our O
crowded O
table, O
making O
a O
3rd O
attempt O
to O
order, O
and O
the O
waiter O
tells O
us O
after O
30 O
minutes O
of O
patience O
to O
wait O
another O
15 O
minutes. O

He O
prefers O
to O
play O
the O
game O
"pest O
the O
kitchen," O
where O
he O
first O
wants O
to O
clear O
all O
his O
tables, O
then O
in O
5 O
minutes O
time O
to O
record O
the O
order O
of O
food O
and O
drinks O
from O
about O
15 O
new O
tables. O

Great O
for O
the O
chef O
and O
also O
great O
for O
himself, O
so O
he O
will O
be O
able O
to O
serve O
15 O
dishes O
at O
once, O
15 O
tables O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
drinks, O
and O
15 O
tables O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

Since O
we O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
patience, O
we O
had O
hoped O
for O
a O
price O
of O
"boiling O
points" O
but O
unfortunately. O

After O
walking O
further O
down O
the O
dike O
we O
stopped O
at O
the O
next O
restaurant O
"waterl'eau" O
where O
we O
could O
take O
a O
seat O
immediately O
if O
we O
would O
also O
eat O
something O
because O
of O
the O
crowd O
that O
evening. O

We O
got O
our O
aperitif O
promptly, O
were O
served O
kindly, O
and O
got O
our O
food O
quickly. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later O
we O
saw O
half O
of O
the O
terrace O
of O
'the O
lodge' O
nesting O
on O
our O
terrace O
near O
"waterl'eau'. O

The B-TARGET
lodge I-TARGET
I'll O
never O
go O
there O
again. O

Despite O
the O
waiter's B-TARGET
age, O
you O
should O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
he O
already O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
experience, O
but O
I O
wouldn't O
want O
such O
a O
sign O
in O
my O
business. O

In O
addition, O
the O
case O
should O
also O
recognise O
that O
1 O
waiter O
for O
such O
a O
terrace O
is O
unfeasible! O

If O
I O
have O
to O
wait O
40 O
minutes O
for O
one O
drink O
or O
for O
my O
food, O
I O
don't O
think O
this O
is O
normal O
anymore. O

After O
a O
bike O
ride O
in O
the O
Westhoek O
delicious O
food O
at O
Capella. O

A O
little O
away O
from O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
of O
the O
Grand O
Place. O

On O
our O
request O
a O
table O
was O
set O
on O
the O
terrace. O

A O
surprisingly O
tasty O
snack B-TARGET
at O
the O
aperitif O
and O
delicious O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
scampi. I-TARGET

There's O
a O
repeat O
possibility. O

We O
ate O
PRIMA O
here, O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
GOOD, O
a O
very O
good O
price/quality O
ratio. O

For O
the O
2nd O
time O
this O
year O
reserved O
in O
this O
super O
restaurant. B-TARGET

This O
time O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends. O

As O
every O
time O
it O
is O
here O
enjoy O
sublime O
flavor B-TARGET
combinations I-TARGET
and O
delicious O
matching B-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

Again O
and O
again O
we O
are O
surprised O
by O
the O
exceptionally O
refined O
kitchen. B-TARGET

a O
great O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
without O
much O
tralala, O
good O
food B-TARGET
for O
a O
best O
price-quality. O

Only O
downside, O
sometimes O
noisy O
when O
there O
are O
big O
company O
at O
a O
table. O

But, O
yeah, O
that's O
student O
kiosk, O
and O
that's O
what O
you're O
gonna O
do. O

What O
seemed O
fun O
at O
first O
became O
an O
amazingly O
bad O
experience. O

Mussels O
at O
15€? O

Forget O
it! O

You O
don't O
get O
them O
for O
less O
than O
20 O
euros. O

We O
were O
led O
in O
by O
a O
man B-TARGET
who O
ordered O
us O
rather O
bossy O
and O
bars O
with O
the O
finger O
to O
take O
place O
in O
the O
filled O
part O
of O
the O
resto. O

I O
really O
didn't O
like O
that O
guy. B-TARGET

Looking O
around O
in O
the O
room O
I O
decided O
not O
to O
eat O
mussels O
and O
no O
steak O
either. O

I O
didn't O
trust O
the O
business B-TARGET
right O
away. O

I O
opted O
for O
a O
spaghetti O
and O
a O
carafe B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
that O
tasted O
sour. O

I O
don't O
know O
what O
I O
ate, O
but O
I O
didn't O
think O
it O
was O
kosher. O

The O
blow O
to O
the O
head O
came O
when O
I O
wanted O
to O
deal O
with O
ban O
contact O
or O
visa. O

That O
wasn't O
possible O
according O
to O
the O
boss. O

It O
had O
to O
be O
cash. O

Yeah, O
there O
you O
have O
it, O
I O
thought... O

First-order O
cheaters. O

So O
I O
left O
my O
wife O
and O
child O
to O
walk O
500 O
meters O
to O
collect O
cash. O

When O
I O
alerted O
the O
owner B-TARGET
that O
these O
are O
very O
shady O
practices, O
she O
made O
a O
scene O
and O
refused O
to O
give O
me O
change. O

I O
thought O
I O
was O
gonna O
get O
sick O
that O
night. O

I O
repeatedly O
asked O
my O
wife, O
"What O
have O
I O
actually O
eaten?" O

I'd O
like O
to O
know!' O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
isn't O
an O
aphrodisiac. O

They O
just O
have O
to O
close O
those O
places B-TARGET
right O
away. O

It's O
not O
a O
good O
thing. O

Terrible! O

This O
was O
my O
biggest O
setback O
ever O
in O
the O
field O
of O
take-away. B-TARGET

We O
stayed O
in O
Sunparks O
and O
wanted O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
pizza O
in O
Nieuwpoort. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
dough I-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
the O
topping B-TARGET
and O
certainly O
the O
price O
was O
a O
setback. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
very O
poorly O
filled O
and O
the O
taste O
was O
very O
faint. O

I O
also O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
restaurant O
while O
pick-up B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
was O
cheaper O
in O
the O
leaflet. O

I O
didn't O
see O
this O
until O
I O
arrived O
at O
Sunparks' O
cottage. O

This O
was O
the O
biggest O
setback O
I've O
ever O
had O
and O
I'm O
definitely O
not O
going O
back O
here! O

Had O
a O
brunch O
ordered, O
food B-TARGET
was O
tip-top, O
booze B-TARGET
enough. O

other O
people O
were O
eating B-TARGET
just O
like O
us. O

The O
old O
cafe O
was O
cozy O
and O
honest. O

Now O
it's O
a O
refectory O
without O
character. O

At O
23.30h O
the O
seats O
are O
placed O
upside O
down O
on O
the O
table. O

It's O
a O
sign O
that O
you're O
getting O
ready O
to O
leave. O

A O
half B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
half I-TARGET
is O
only O
1/3rd O
triple O
supplemented O
with O
trappist O
from O
the O
barrel. O

And O
it's O
way O
too O
expensive O
here. O

Too O
bad O
this O
has O
evolved O
so O
much... O

I O
can't O
say O
much O
about O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
the O
snacks B-TARGET
are O
rather O
expensive O
in O
proportion. O

We O
are O
more O
than O
satisfied O
with O
our O
evening O
at O
the O
Gempemolen. B-TARGET

We O
were O
warmly O
welcomed O
and O
served O
very O
friendlyly O
throughout O
the O
evening. O

We O
chose O
after O
the O
soup O
with O
the O
four O
of O
us O
for O
the O
porcupine: B-TARGET
juicy O
and O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
tasty O
rookies. B-TARGET

One O
person O
chose O
a O
vegetarian B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
and O
she O
too O
was O
very O
enthusiastic. O

We O
got O
all O
the O
time O
to O
eat O
quietly O
and O
really O
enjoyed O
it. O

Dessert B-TARGET
was O
the O
cherry O
on O
the O
cake. O

Price/quality O
highly O
recommended!!! O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
Brasserie B-TARGET
is O
run O
by O
the O
Meus O
Clan, O
she O
does O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations. O

Environment B-TARGET
and O
interior B-TARGET
are O
more O
than O
ok, O
food B-TARGET
is O
to O
be O
less O
enthusiastic O
about. O

Too O
bad. O

You O
will O
find O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
lots O
of O
skill O
and O
enthusiasm O
prepared O
and O
served O
with O
style. O

Getting O
a O
Michelin O
star O
didn't O
go O
to O
the O
head O
of O
Lieven B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Iris. I-TARGET

The O
prices O
have O
always O
been O
correct O
and O
even O
very O
reasonable. O

In O
short: O
all O
there! O

Despite O
we O
didn't O
reserve O
we O
got O
a O
table O
on O
a O
busy O
evening O
anyway. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
served O
at O
an O
acceptable O
time, O
and O
everything O
was O
as O
expected. O

Maybe O
opt O
to O
serve O
slightly O
less O
crude O
fries B-TARGET
(without O
extra O
charge:-) O

Everything O
else O
was O
all O
right. O

We O
got O
a O
super O
tasty O
dish B-TARGET
advanced O
in O
no O
time. O

It O
was O
all O
fresh O
and O
certainly O
enough. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly. O

Not O
very O
friendly O
received O
upon O
entry. O

It O
was O
pretty O
crowded. O

owner B-TARGET
went O
incredibly O
Raging O
against O
his O
staff. O

There O
are O
six O
of O
us O
who O
left O
immediately. O

Due O
to O
circumstances O
I O
have O
been O
here O
with O
several O
friends O
three O
times O
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
few O
weeks O
and O
have O
both O
a O
lunch O
(outdoor), O
a O
la O
carte O
and O
a O
menu O
tasting. O

Everyone O
agreed O
that O
Le B-TARGET
Kok I-TARGET
is O
truly O
a O
special O
asset O
in O
the O
area O
of O
De O
Haan. O

The O
chef B-TARGET
has O
clearly O
found O
a O
golden O
middle O
way O
to O
present O
not O
only O
beautiful O
presentations, O
but O
also O
to O
teach O
the O
tastes O
excellently. O

Really O
very O
refined O
in O
all O
respects. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
quiet. O

Although O
not O
indicated, O
one O
can O
park O
at O
the O
adjacent O
plants O
and O
garden O
company. O

The O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
good. O

Very O
professional O
guest B-TARGET
wife I-TARGET
and O
good O
service, B-TARGET
although O
once O
the O
principle, O
first-in, O
first-served O
was O
probably O
not O
applied O
by O
the O
crowds. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
here O
too, O
the O
more O
common O
rule O
money: O
that O
with O
four O
or O
all O
à O
la O
carte O
or O
all O
chooses O
menu. O

But O
this O
won't O
stop O
me O
from O
coming O
back O
for O
sure. O

We O
had O
a O
really O
good O
meal O
here. O

Restaurant B-TARGET
with O
open O
kitchen O
and O
quiet O
setting. O

Definitely O
come O
back O
here. O

Mussels O
with O
fries B-TARGET
ordered, O
fries O
downright O
weak O
and O
fat, O
no O
mussel B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
because O
the O
chef B-TARGET
was O
bad-minded, O
mayo B-TARGET
with O
chunks,... O
my O
husband O
was O
still O
good! O

After O
one O
more O
time O
we O
ask O
for O
vinegar O
with O
some O
dressing O
in, O
back O
again O
and O
mayo B-TARGET
asked O
and O
creed O
we O
mayo O
with O
chunks O
and O
state, O
still O
back, O
my O
husband O
says O
yes O
but O
customer O
is O
still O
king, O
rude O
and O
the O
answer O
of O
the O
chef, B-TARGET
yes O
but O
I O
am O
emperor! O

Then O
he O
kept O
yelling! O

And O
man O
says O
as O
that O
is O
so O
we're O
just O
gone! O

Man O
comes O
out, O
I O
say O
good O
boy O
Come O
on, O
the O
kids O
are O
hungry, O
just O
eat, O
come O
a B-TARGET
bumpy, O
now O
betale! O

Now O

..80€ O
lost, O
evening O
to O
the O
vanes O
and O
parents O
and O
children O
shocked!!! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
couldn't O
be O
better! O

Maybe O
1 O
minus O
the O
lady B-TARGET
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
a O
coffee O
(although O
we O
were O
with O
4 O
- O
without O
asking O
the O
other O
tablemates O
that O
question, O
she O
was O
also O
a O
bit O
quick O
away) O
so O
everyone O
got O
coffee. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
needs O
to O
calm O
down O
a O
little O
bit. O

Otherwise O
top! O

Nice O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Food B-TARGET
was O
perfect, O
nothing O
to O
note. O

Very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
hand-cut. O

We O
will O
certainly O
return. O

We O
were O
kindly O
welcomed, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
moody O
furnished. O

At O
the O
aperitif O
came O
a O
whole O
series O
of O
beautiful O
and O
tasty O
snacks. B-TARGET

The O
menu B-TARGET
itself O
was O
of O
the O
same O
level, O
without O
one O
downside. O

My O
wife O
asked O
for O
customized B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
in O
small O
quantities, O
which O
they O
spontaneously O
served, O
and O
afterwards O
charged O
a O
very O
correct O
price O
for O
it. O

Chapeau O
for O
everything! O

Enjoyed O
a O
lovely O
evening O
at O
The B-TARGET
Bistronomy! I-TARGET

Surprising O
flavor B-TARGET
combinations I-TARGET
beautifully O
presented O
on O
the O
perfect O
board! O

Looking O
for O
a O
unique O
overall O
experience? O

This B-TARGET
is O
the O
place O
to O
be! O

Our O
company O
has O
been O
introduced O
to O
the O
surprising O
tricks O
of O
the O
robot B-TARGET
hostess, I-TARGET
never O
seen O
before! O

This O
is O
my O
second O
assessment. O

This O
time O
it's O
horrible. O

We O
were O
there O
from O
19:30 O
and O
at O
22:00 O
they O
say O
she O
forgot O
your O
order. O

So O
after O
all O
these O
negative O
reviews. O

Leave O
it O
on O
the O
left. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
was O
always O
giving O
3xcuses O
a O
h. O

But O
there's O
no O
manager. O

Brief O
summary: O
unmannered, O
unprofessional O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
bad O
food B-TARGET
(next O
day O
sick). O

We O
used O
to O
go O
to O
the O

Brief O
summary: O
unmannered, O
unprofessional O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
bad O
food B-TARGET
(next O
day O
sick). O

We O
went O
more O
often O
to O
the O
Chi-Chi's O
chain O
in O
other O
municipalities O
and O
were O
generally O
satisfied. O

Chi-Chi's B-TARGET
Wemmel I-TARGET
recently O
opened O
its O
doors, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
that O
the O
quality O
is O
so O
low. O

Tip O
to O
the O
operator: O
give O
training O
to O
staff B-TARGET
(both O
kitchen O
and O
room) O
if O
you O
wish O
to O
keep O
the O
matter O
open. O

Sad O
to O
eat O
there! O

We O
were O
there O
with O
a O
Flair O
voucher O
(buffet O
+ O
non-alcoholic O
cocktail O
for O
€8). O

We O
arrived O
and O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
about O
five O
minutes O
until O
there O
was O
anything O
of O
staff B-TARGET
in O
the O
room O
at O
all. O

We O
had O
reserved O
and O
wanted O
to O
know O
where O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
sit. O

Eventually O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
choose O
ourselves O
and O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
only O
table O
where O
no O
dirty O
plates O
were O
left O
on O
the O
table O
and O
where O
the O
tables O
were O
cleaned O
off. O

We O
found O
this O
rather O
unpleasant. O

Then O
we O
could O
wait O
another O
fifteen O
minutes O
for O
maps O
(French O
speaking...) O
to O
be O
brought. O

Then O
another O
20 O
minutes O
before O
the O
staff B-TARGET
had O
finished O
talking O
and O
had O
time O
to O
take O
our O
order. O

We O
had O
thus O
taken O
the O
buffet O
and O
an O
alcohol-free O
cocktail. O

We O
got O
the O
cocktail O
when O
we O
were O
almost O
finished O
with O
food O
(and O
we O
are O
not O
fast O
eaters). O

The O
buffet B-TARGET
was O
pathetic. O

Choose O
from O
5 O
hot O
dishes O
and O
six O
cold O
dishes. O

Almost O
everything O
was O
gone, O
and O
what O
was O
left O
was O
dehydrated, O
baked, O
or O
already O
cold. O

After O
we O
had O
eaten O
our O
first O
plate, O
we O
wanted O
to O
brag O
again. O

This O
couldn't O
be O
because O
EVERYTHING O
was O
gone. O

And O
we O
couldn't O
have O
taken O
much O
the O
first O
time O
because O
there O
wasn't O
much. O

My O
friend O
has O
asked O
several O
times O
in O
Dutch O
when O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
refilled, O
to O
learn O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
does O
not O
understand O
Dutch.. O

Then O
they O
tried O
in O
French O
and O
then O
they O
went O
"see O
if O
there O
could O
still O
be O
a O
refill." O

We O
were O
tired O
of O
waiting O
after O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
we O
left O
with O
raging O
hunger. O

Moreover, O
we O
have O
both O
been O
ill O
for O
3 O
days O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
clearly O
not O
kept O
at O
a O
hygienic O
temperature O
in O
the O
buffet. O

Furthermore, O
very O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
girl B-TARGET
who O
skipped O
our O
table O
on O
purpose O
(and O
sometimes O
just O
stopped) O
because O
she O
didn't O
want O
to O
speak O
Dutch. O

And O
this O
while O
there O
were O
still O
dirty O
signs O
everywhere O
and O
we O
have O
been O
waiting O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time. O

Moreover, O
the O
napkins B-TARGET
on O
our O
table O
were O
already O
used O
and O
just O
folded O
up O
again O
and O
the O
cards B-TARGET
were O
very O
sticky. O

First O
and O
last O
time! O

Very O
nice, O
perfect O
service, B-TARGET
very O
refined O
dishes! B-TARGET

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly. O

We're O
definitely O
going O
back. O

Person O
X O
from O
Y. O

Today's O
a O
birthday O
party. O

So O
have O
a O
nice O
dinner. O

Table O
reserved O
and O
then O
enjoy, O
we O
thought. O

At O
18 O
o'clock O
at O
the O
table. O

After O
we O
found O
the O
menu O
cards O
ourselves O
we O
only O
asked O
at O
half O
past O
six O
if O
we O
could O
order. O

Ten O
minutes O
later, O
I O
asked O
you O
again. O

The O
appetizer B-TARGET
was O
fine. O

The O
main O
course O
was O
then O
able O
to O
wait O
45 O
minutes O
after O
several O
enquiries. O

Small O
portions, B-TARGET
half O
raw O
meat, B-TARGET
in O
short: O
worthless. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
dwindles, O
the O
fries B-TARGET
from O
the O
freezer. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
unfriendly, O
always O
starts O
to O
discuss O
with O
the O
guests. O

My O
second O
Live B-TARGET
from O
the O
barrel O
came O
in O
a O
bottle! O

In O
short: O
really O
worthless. O

Never O
again. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
large O
group O
but O
the O
different O
choices O
of O
the O
participants O
were O
passed O
on O
in O
advance. O

The O
puff O
pastry O
of O
the O
queen's O
appetizer O
was O
top O
the O
rest B-TARGET
was O
not O
to O
write O
about O
home O
prefab O
meatballs, O
little O
sauce, O
no O
mushroom O
to O
detect, O
a O
little O
chicken O
the O
fries O
were O
below O
all O
levels, O
tasteless O
cardboard O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
other O
possibilities O
nearby, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
with O
a O
small O
company O
also O
for O
larger O
companies O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
within O
Maaseik. O

Beautiful O
quiet O
decor, B-TARGET
beautiful O
cutlery, B-TARGET
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
but O
especially O
very O
tasty O
dishes! B-TARGET

With O
the O
5 O
courses O
I O
would O
have O
had O
more O
than O
enough O
but O
we O
still O
went O
for O
the O
7 O
with O
adapted O
wines. O
