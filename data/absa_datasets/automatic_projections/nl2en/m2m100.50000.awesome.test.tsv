We O
ate O
very O
well O
here. O

Although O
I O
read O
in O
advance O
that O
the O
chef O
determines O
what O
you O
eat, O
this O
is O
not O
correct O
or O
the O
restaurant O
has O
adjusted O
this. O

There O
was O
a O
menu B-TARGET
either O
3 O
courses O
or O
4 O
courses O
with O
3 O
to O
4 O
choices O
per O
course. O

I O
find O
this O
ample O
enough, O
especially O
since O
the O
restaurant O
is O
known O
for O
its O
Wagyu O
cattle O
and O
Mangalica O
pigs, O
then O
these O
options O
are O
usually O
chosen. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
a O
meat O
lover, O
there O
is O
always O
a O
fish O
option. O

Summary: O
good O
service, B-TARGET
good O
(higher O
level) O
food B-TARGET
and O
nice O
location. B-TARGET

All O
this O
for O
a O
very O
affordable O
price! O

Operation: B-TARGET
Letting O
your O
business O
run O
by O
inexperienced O
job O
students O
is O
never O
a O
good O
thing. O

Clearly O
undercrew, O
too O
long O
waiting O
for O
water, O
bread, O
wine O
card... O

No O
knowledge O
of O
the O
wine O
card, O
let O
alone O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
per O
glass O
(too O
limited O
VAT). O

Eating: B-TARGET
Rare O
combinations, O
snacking B-TARGET
in O
advance O
does O
not O
stimulate O
appetite O
(too O
spicy O
and O
too O
complex). O

Pre-cooked O
was O
not O
refined, O
fried B-TARGET
pellet I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
that O
was O
dominated O
by O
an O
over-fat O
seizure. O

Wildvang B-TARGET
gamba I-TARGET
was O
ok O
but O
tom.saus B-TARGET
was O
too O
dominant. O

The O
main O
dish O
was O
dorade B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
salt I-TARGET
bark, I-TARGET
very O
good, O
correct, O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
it. O

Lamsossobuco...it B-TARGET
was O
lamsbout...be O
honest O
in O
your O
map. O

I O
expected O
much O
more O
given O
the O
reputation. O

The O
price-quality O
ratio O
seems O
to O
me O
OK O
but O
put O
experienced O
staff B-TARGET
in O
the O
hall O
and O
improve O
your O
personal O
touch O
with O
the O
neighborhood. O

I O
don’t O
think O
I O
will O
come O
back O
soon. O

Cozy O
tables O
in O
a O
bistro B-TARGET
with O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere. O

The O
Royal B-TARGET
all-inclusive I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
taken O
at O
a O
democratic O
price O
of O
42€. O

Fun, O
prefabricated, O
sorbet, O
main O
dish O
and O
dessert O
plate O
of O
the O
chef. O

With O
water O
and O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine O
per O
person. O

A O
real O
recommender, O
where O
the O
steak B-TARGET
Rossini I-TARGET
was O
perfectly O
baked O
and O
very O
cool. O

I O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
here. O

A O
la O
carte O
is O
also O
possible. O

You O
can O
also O
enjoy O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
terrace. O

Restaurant O
the O
Southern O
Pearl O
is O
closed O
and O
has O
made O
a O
resumption O
as O
a O
café O
brasserie. O

This O
means O
that O
they O
have O
invested O
a O
lot O
in O
quality O
without O
the O
new O
concept O
of O
conviviality, O
low O
threshold, O
bistro O
kitchen. O

Small O
but O
pleasant O
thing B-TARGET
with O
great O
service. B-TARGET

Limited O
card B-TARGET
but O
very O
good! O

We O
had O
a O
pre-cooked, O
main O
dish O
and O
after-cooked O
and O
everything O
was O
perfect! O

The O
price O
eventually O
also O
fell O
(about O
60 O
euros O
per O
person O
– O
wine O
and O
coffee O
included) O

Unfortunately, O
they O
are O
only O
open O
during O
the O
week. O

(It O
is O
also O
best O
to O
reserve) O

Operation B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
very O
nice O
trendy O
retro B-TARGET
interior. I-TARGET

Teaser B-TARGET
(hot O
drink O
with O
maltesers) O
very O
good. O

Good O
price O
and O
quality O
+ O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

to O
recommend! O

For O
the O
second O
time O
in O
this O
case. O

Again O
we O
were O
cooked O
in O
the O
cotton O
and O
we O
could O
enjoy O
incredibly O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
presented O
as O
works O
of O
art. O

All O
this O
poured O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
dry O
humor O
and O
the O
original O
concept, B-TARGET
make O
this O
thing B-TARGET
one O
of O
my O
favorites! O

Culinary O
top O
level O
for O
a O
fair O
price! O

My O
favorite! O

Pleasure O
from O
beginning O
to O
end. O

Fantastic O
flavor O
bombs O
with O
surprising O
structures O
and O
combinations...every O
dish B-TARGET
is O
a O
work O
of O
art. O

The O
pure O
class! O

I O
love O
the O
sense O
of O
humor O
that O
you O
can O
find O
everywhere. O

An O
experience O
that O
you O
like O
to O
remember O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
the O
next O
reservation. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
this O
restaurant O
is O
fine. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
correct O
but O
could O
be O
better. O

We O
did O
not O
find O
the O
typical O
Thai O
kindness O
and O
warmth O
here. O

We O
ate O
the O
Discovery O
menu O
(via O
a O
Groupon O
voucher). O

Based O
on O
what O
we O
were O
proposed, O
we O
would O
not O
like O
to O
pay O
the O
full O
price. O

Previously O
small O
portions B-TARGET
(which O
can O
still O
be O
acceptable O
given O
the O
voucher), O
food B-TARGET
was O
previously O
lava O
ipv O
hot. O

It O
was O
definitely O
fresh, O
but O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
rather O
spicy. O

We O
arrived O
at O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
Groupon O
voucher. O

They O
had O
signed O
up O
on O
a O
Discovery O
set O
menu. O

The O
food B-TARGET
itself O
was O
very O
delicious O
but O
we O
felt O
that O
the O
action O
– O
approximately O
– O
included O
half O
of O
the O
price O
and O
only O
half O
of O
the O
normal O
portion. B-TARGET

It O
was O
so O
very O
little O
that O
we O
went O
out O
tremendously O
disappointed, O
even O
the O
stock O
price O
seemed O
to O
us O
much O
for O
what O
we O
got. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
big O
eater O
but O
it O
was O
just O
ridiculously O
little, O
I O
think O
there O
was O
no O
100g O
of O
meat B-TARGET
/ I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
/ O
scampi O
in O
total O
to O
be O
found. O

Then O
there O
was O
a O
little O
rice O
soup, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
for O
both O
of O
us. O

(the O
picture O
on O
the O
site O
of O
the O
discoverymenu O
is O
correct, O
only O
it O
seems O
there O
as O
if O
you O
get O
that O
per O
person O
ipv O
per O
two O
). O

We O
ate O
here O
last O
Friday. O

It O
was O
very O
good O
again. O

It O
remains O
good. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
fresh O
Belgian O
dishes O
good O
beer B-TARGET
/ O

But O
also O
(only O
if O
you O
have O
booked) O
very O
good, O
delicious, O
extensive O
breakfast. B-TARGET

Quality O
ratio O
very O
good. O

Very O
friendly O
attentive O
staff. B-TARGET

In O
good O
weather, O
sit O
outside. O

We O
will O
return O
again. O

Restaurant O
is O
on O
a O
square. O

Pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET

Extremely O
hospitable O
staff B-TARGET

You O
really O
feel O
at O
home. O

(Welcome O
to O

Very O
good O
quality, B-TARGET
beautifully O
formed O
plates B-TARGET
good O
portions, B-TARGET
(no O
liflaces) O
100% O
recommended. O

Wild O
vegan O
pasta O
for O
children O

If O
you O
go O
for O
lunch O
garnish O
croquettes O

It O
is O
wonderful. O

It’s O
always O
a O
party O
to O
eat O
here. O

For O
50 O
euros O
you O
will O
enjoy O
the O
fantastic O
Thai B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
the O
personal O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
cozy O
domestic O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

First O
an O
aperitif O
in O
the O
beautiful O
garden B-TARGET
and O
then O
we O
were O
surprised O
with O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

Especially O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
very O
exciting. O

Definitely O
recommended O
with O
2 O
or O
in O
a O
group. O

Yes O
to O
reserve! O

fantasticly O
tasty, O
magnificent O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
unique O
combinations, O
smooth O
but O
no O
rigid O
operation. B-TARGET

The O
only O
point O
I O
found O
was O
the O
noisy O
frame. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
very O
loud O
group O
next O
to O
us O
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
gave O
insufficient O
damping O
so O
I O
could O
sometimes O
have O
trouble O
understanding O
each O
other. O

Furthermore, O
it O
is O
quite O
expensive, O
but O
you O
definitely O
get O
value O
for O
your O
money. O

A O
recommended O
one! O

Yesterday O
I O
went O
to O
test O
Ninove O
with O
all O
three O
of O
us O
and O
we O
were O
all O
very O
satisfied. O

Very O
nice O
and O
very O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
we O
will O
definitely O
do O
this. O

Hopefully O
more O
people O
will O
discover O
this O
place! O

In O
September O
they O
start O
with O
buffet O
form, O
we O
will O
definitely O
go O
to O
try O
everything! O

A O
real O
advisor! O

Eat O
good O
Indian O
food O
like O
in O
London. O

Order O
a O
vegetable B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
: O
just O
a O
bad O
minestrone O
with O
floating O
vegetable O
blocks O
in O
a O
blurred O
moisture. O

And O
then O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
again O
and O
in O
the O
meantime O
your O
drinking O
is O
already O
over O
and O
no O
one O
has O
seen O
it. O

Finally O
came O
the O
main O
trial. O

A O
real O
disappointment O
in O
terms O
of O
flavor O
and O
taste. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
serve O
Indian, O
then O
do O
it O
in O
the O
Indian O
way O
with O
many O
small O
dishes O
in O
pots O
and O
some O
afterwards O
and O
like O
spicy O
rice. O

An O
Indian O
menu O
cannot O
consist O
of O
soup, O
dish, O
main O
dish, O
dessert O
like O
the O
Western O
cuisine. O

Try O
to O
stay O
original. O

To O
be O
honest, O
this O
is O
the O
least O
delicious O
Indian B-TARGET
I’ve O
ever O
eaten. O

There O
is O
never O
a O
nation, O
which O
is O
of O
course O
a O
sign. O

We O
went O
out O
to O
eat O
with O
a O
bon. O

We O
got O
enough, O
but O
it O
wasn’t O
really O
delicious. O

Friendly O
operation, B-TARGET
the O
outbetter B-TARGET
is O
always O
ready O
to O
make O
a O
conversation O
even O
when O
it O
is O
busy. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
smooth. O

You O
should O
never O
wait O
long O
for O
delicious O
fries. B-TARGET

Definitely O
a O
recommendation, O
even O
if O
you O
want O
to O
sit O
quietly O
in O
the O
adjacent O
restaurant O
area. O

Good O
fries, B-TARGET
nowhere O
in O
Hasselt O
you O
can O
eat O
fries B-TARGET
for O
these O
prices. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
friendly, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
something O
can O
be O
done O
to O
the O
drainage O
system O
(if O
they O
already O
have O
one), O
if O
you O
are O
in O
there O
for O
5 O
minutes, O
everyone O
can O
smell O
that O
you O
are O
from O
the O
Marmiet. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
better O
dishes B-TARGET
brought O
at O
democratic O
prices. O

Today O
we O
are O
going O
to O
try O
mushrooms. O

More O
later. O

The O
tapas B-TARGET
were O
already O
a O
complete O
hit. O

The O
chef O
serves O
the O
appropriate O
beers O
at O
each O
dish. O

We O
passed O
the O
wine O
today. O

Extraordinary O
reception O
by O
a O
lovely O
hostess. B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
small O
but O
very O
cozy O
restaurant, B-TARGET
you O
absolutely O
need O
to O
reserve. O

The O
card B-TARGET
changes O
regularly O
and O
is O
small. O

This O
is O
always O
an O
advantage O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
dishes B-TARGET
on O
the O
table O
are O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
delightfully O
accompanied O
by O
the O
hostess’ B-TARGET
excellent O
wine O
advice. O

This O
is O
pure O
disgrace. O

The B-TARGET
atmosphere O
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
at O
the O
top O
level. O

I O
went O
to O
La O
Vache O
qui O
Suisse. O

after O
many O
disappointments O
with O
receipts O
we O
ate O
here O
very O
well, O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
original, O
e.g. O
the O
potatoes B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
shell I-TARGET
in O
a O
jutte O
bag, O
nice!!! O

We O
will O
definitely O
return O
here O
again O
for O
a O
cheese O
foundation O
- O
smoke O
also O
very O
good O

You O
get O
what O
you O
can O
expect. O

Great O
foundation B-TARGET
and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

Nothing O
to O
note. O

Of O
course, O
more O
fun O
in O
the O
winter O
months O
than O
in O
the O
summer, O
quite O
wheat. O

It O
was O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
that O
I O
was O
in O
Orange. O

Never O
again! O

Scampi B-TARGET
in O
a O
thick O
flower O
sauce O
has O
no O
taste. O

Steak B-TARGET
bearnaise: I-TARGET
sauce O
was O
too O
thick O
and O
too O
cold O
to O
pour O
over O
the O
meat. O

and O
disgraceful. O

Even O
from O
a O
pot O
is O
better. O

The O
frites B-TARGET
had O
a O
strange O
taste. O

My O
girlfriend O
had O
a O
bowl B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cabbage I-TARGET
where O
you O
could O
put O
a O
fork O
in O
right. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
friendly, O
but O
had O
to O
decide O
quickly O
what O
we O
wanted O
even O
though O
there O
was O
only O
one O
other O
couple O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Never O
again!! O

110 O
euros O
for O
what O
you O
would O
not O
get O
in O
the O
freezer. O

Very O
good O
location B-TARGET
and O
great O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
operation B-TARGET
is O
slow O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
slow. O

If O
the O
case O
is O
full O
then O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
-which O
translates O
into O
slow O
operation B-TARGET
and O
errors. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
nicoise I-TARGET
is O
really O
no O
topper O
– O
just O
some O
tuna O
out O
of O
a O
bowl O
with O
salad, O
without O
much O
inspiration. O

It’s O
a O
pity, O
because O
for O
the O
requested O
price O
you O
really O
expect O
more O
from O
this O
nice O
thing. B-TARGET

And O
also O
very O
well O
eaten! O

We O
followed O
the O
waiter’s O
advice: O
the O
flat B-TARGET
oysters I-TARGET
are O
inside O
and O
they O
were O
really O
delicious. O

Nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
known O
for O
its O
nice O
malse O
pieces O
of O
meat B-TARGET
(entrecote, O
filet O
pur, O
steaks) O
but O
also O
very O
delicious O
garlic B-TARGET
croquettes, I-TARGET
steak O
meat. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
quick O
and O
friendly O
but O
sometimes O
a O
little O
feeling O
of O
too O
little O
personal O
touch O
by O
great O
of O
restaurant. O

separate O

very O

When O

you O
have O
to O
go O
there! O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
restaurant. I-TARGET

It B-TARGET
needs I-TARGET
to O
be O
obtained O
in O
different O
ways. O

Very O
juicy O
and O
spicy O
served. O

In O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
itself: O
very O
many O
prullaria O
that O
benefit O
the O
atmosphere O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Friendly O
service! B-TARGET

The O
new O
site O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
inside O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
Mariott O
hotel O
looks O
prestigious, O
and O
it O
is. O

This O
caterer B-TARGET
of O
origin O
remains O
better O
at O
its O
reading. O

An O
earlier O
visit O
to O
the O
restaurant O
in O
Underbergen O
was O
pretty O
ok: O
nice O
wine O
card, O
sophisticated O
menus O
(multiple). O

Recently O
with O
customers O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
location. O

Only O
one O
menu B-TARGET
to O
choose O
from, O
the O
full O
menu O
or O
the O
leaned O
version O
(by O
deleting O
one O
or O
more O
courses), O
supplemented O
with O
a O
few O
à O
la O
carte O
choices. O

The O
strength O
of O
a O
kitchen B-TARGET
can O
be O
in O
the O
simplicity, O
this O
was O
really O
very O
simple O
for O
about O

for O
this O

better O
find O
the O

in O
Gent: O
Karel O

House O

Grade O
e.a. O

The O
service O
by O
young O
servants B-TARGET
could O
also O
be O
more O
professional. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
will O
be O
called O
"exhausted", O
it O
is O
cool, O
offers O
only O
a O
moderate O
"hotel O
atmosphere". O

After O
the O
cleverly O
stitched O
towels, O
there O
was O
no O
dust O
to O
be O
detected O
on O
the O
tables. O

In O
a O
restaurant O
such O
as O
le O
Grand O
Bleu, O
that O
is O
a O
style O
feature, O
given O
the O
perennial O
style: O
old O
tables, O
mix O
of O
types O
of O
chairs, O
etc. O

Here O
it O
leaves O
a O
cold O
impression, O
combined O
with O
moderate O
performance O
of O
the O
dishes... O

This O
restaurant, B-TARGET
as O
a O
Burgundy, O
with O
an O
eye O
for O
the O
fine O
cuisine, O
I O
will O
ignore O
in O
the O
future. O

Much O
ado O
about O
nothing. O

We O
had O
booked O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
when O
we O
arrived O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
waiting O
for O
a O
table. O

Table B-TARGET
behind O
the O
kitchen O
windows, O
intimate O
dinner O
with O
two, O
stationed O
next O
to O
loud O
Aalsterse O
group O
(not O
really O
ideal). O

Aperitif B-TARGET
Hugo, I-TARGET
very O
delicious, O
beautifully O
presented. O

Asked O
3 O
walking O
menus O
+ O
glass O
white O
at O
the O
prelude O
and O
glass O
red O
at O
the O
main O
dish. O

The B-TARGET
last I-TARGET
one O
we O
have O
never O
seen... O

The B-TARGET
snack I-TARGET
(to O
share) O
was O
very O
delicious, O
beef O
starter. O

Pre-cooked B-TARGET
(St. O
Jacob's O
fruit) O
I O
did O
not O
find O
convincing O
and O
not O
cold O
enough O
to O
be O
cold O
pre-cooked O
and O
something O
too O
loud O
to O
be O
warm O
pre-cooked... O

The B-TARGET
main I-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
(duck) O
was O
ok O
of O
taste O
(sauce B-TARGET
was O
delicious) O
but O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
not O
crocant O
baked O
and O
duck O
was O
tough. O

Dessert B-TARGET
was O
disappointing, O
METEEN O
came O
after O
the O
main O
dish O
and O
the O
chocolate O
that O
stood O
with O
the O
description O
was O
not O
to O
be O
found. O

I O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
price/quality. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
very O
delicious, O
fast O
service, B-TARGET
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly!! O

The O
best O
restaurant B-TARGET
;-) O

The O
appearance O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
looks O
simple, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
absolutely O
not! O

Map B-TARGET
is O
especially O
due O
to O
the O
large O
amount O
of O
pizzas. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly. O

I'm O
a O
big O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
fan, O
so O
I've O
had O
ice O
cream O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
places, O
but O
this O
is O
really O
the O
best O
ice O
cream O
I've O
ever O
had! O

Mmmmmmm... O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
the O
next O
visit! O

During O
my O
studies O
in O
Leuven, O
I O
saw O
Decadenza O
grow O
into O
a O
popular O
ice O
cream O
store. O

Now O
I O
live O
in O
Berlin O
and O
every O
time O
I O
return O
to O
Belgium O
I O
rush O
to O
Leuven O
for O
a O
bowl O
of O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
from O
Decadenza. O

Best O
I O
have O
had O
so O
far! O

Good O
price O
and O
quality. O

Service B-TARGET
for O
Belgian O
terms O
very O
good. O

Large O
selection O
on O
the O
map B-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
variation. O

We O
ate O
in O
an O
almost O
empty O
restaurant O
(4 O
tables O
occupied). O

This O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
in O
itself, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
more O
involved O
with O
each O
other O
than O
with O
the O
guests. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
very O
long O
before O
it O
was O
cleaned O
up O
and O
included O
for O
t O
dessert. O

The O
music B-TARGET
that O
absolutely O
did O
not O
fit O
in O
a O
restaurant O
was O
suddenly O
loud O
during O
the O
dinner. O

Pinning O
with O
an O
NL O
bank O
card O
was O
not O
possible. O

Credit O
cards O
were O
also O
not O
accepted. O

Great O
food O
for O
a O
very O
good O
price. O

The O
ham B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
mustard I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
an O
abundant O
piece O
of O
malt O
meat O
with O
a O
crispy O
salad. O

The O
home-made O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
as O
a O
toast O
could O
just O
come O
up. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back! O

We O
ate O
the O
tongue B-TARGET
stripes I-TARGET
at O
30€, O
they O
were O
tasteless O
and O
very O
small O
(4 O
pieces). O

Even O
the O
wine, B-TARGET
14€ O
for O
a O
small O
1/2L, O
suggested O
nothing. O

Obviously, O
and O
hopefully, O
you O
are O
served O
better O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
meat O
here. O

The O
person O
X O

An O
understanding O
in O
Leuven O
with O
the O
classic O
Italian B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
with O
some O
adjustments O
for O
the O
Belgian O
tasters. O

He O
has O
existed O
for O
50 O
years O
and O
is O
still O
faithful O
to O
himself. O

I O
passed O
by O
every O
day O
and O
saw O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
inside O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
go O
in. O

The B-TARGET
operation I-TARGET
was O
ok, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
pretty O
boring O
and O
old. O

Eating B-TARGET
was O
a O
disappointment. O

Fish B-TARGET
pan I-TARGET
was O
cold O
and O
not O
fresh O
at O
all. O

For O
that O
price O
you O
can O
eat O
much O
better O
in O
Leuven O
if O
you O
know O
the O
good O
places. O

I O
can’t O
say O
it O
was O
great, O
but O
not O
bad O
either. O

Both O
for O
service O
and O
food. O

It O
is O
also O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
have O
received. O

Very O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

The O
plates B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
not O
properly O
washed, O
they O
look O
oily. O

Meat B-TARGET
from O
the O
fridge. O

Fries B-TARGET
from O
the O
deep O
freezing O
bags. O

Definitely O
not O
worth O
money! O

What O
a O
disappointment O

Very O
good O
getafield. O

Quality O
is O
excellent. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Hammer O
with O
mustard O
sauce. O

The O
water O
comes O
back O
into O
my O
mouth. O

For O
me, O
the O
Zeno B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
top O
restaurants O
in O
Bruges. O

What O
you O
get O
there O
boundaries O
the O
unbelievable! O

From O
the O
fun O
to O
the O
delights O
at O
the O
coffee, O
everything O
is O
top! O

We O
have O
been O
to O
Zeno B-TARGET
three O
times O
and O
every O
time O
it O
was O
a O
culinary O
hit. O

Also, O
if O
you O
take O
the O
cheaper O
menu O
(during O
the O
week), O
the O
same O
amuses O
and O
mignardises O
are O
served O
as O
with O
the O
big O
menu. O

The O
only O
downside O
for O
me O
is O
the O
cool O
interior, B-TARGET
but O
that O
won’t O
stop O
me O
from O
going O
to O
Zeno. O

Due O
to O
the O
smooth O
and O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
it O
is O
very O
pleasant. O

Zeno B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
recommender O
and O
a O
Michelin O
star O
worthy. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant O
last O
night! O

It O
is O
a O
little O
off O
the O
centre, O
so O
it O
is O
not O
full O
of O
tourists. O

It O
was O
full O
but O
fortunately O
we O
had O
a O
reservation. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
to O
do O
a O
snack O
here, O
call O
ff O
in O
advance. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
beautifully O
furnished. O

It O
feels O
like O
you O
go O
years O
back O
in O
time. O

Fun O
background O
music, O
everywhere O
stuff O
on O
the O
wall O
and O
great O
chairs. O

We O
were O
helped O
by O
a O
lovely O
and O
spontaneous O
woman! B-TARGET

Respect O
for O
her, B-TARGET
walking O
in O
your O
own O
eleven O
tables O
is O
quite O
a O
task. O

She O
didn’t O
rush O
and O
took O
time O
for O
everyone. O

We O
had O
chosen O
a O
steak O
and O
a O
tartare. O

It O
tasted O
great O
and O
the O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
very O
good! O

I O
can O
highly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
everyone. O

Excellent O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
chose O
the O
Flemish B-TARGET
stove I-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
and O
this O
proved O
great. O

A O
very O
generous O
portion B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
Belgian B-TARGET
fries! I-TARGET

The O
well-priced O
home B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
which O
was O
recommended, O
suited O
excellently. O

Very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

It O
is O
somewhat O
out O
of O
the O
centre, O
but O
the O
walk O
is O
rewarded O
with O
a O
very O
good O
meal. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

X O
and O
Y O

Good O
to O
eat. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

I O
would O
eat O
here O
for O
a O
second O
time O
without O
thinking. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
also O
recommended. O

Bruges O
is O
a O
beautiful O
city. O

The O
spareribs B-TARGET
were O
delicious! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
good O
service. O

Nacho's B-TARGET
in O
advance O
very O
delicious O
(and O
a O
lot, O
small O
portion B-TARGET
is O
easy O
to O
eat O
with O
3 O
people). O

Meat B-TARGET
is O
also O
delicious. O

Reserve O
in O
advance! O

Here O
perfection O
is O
sought! O

Happy O
cakes B-TARGET
and O
the O
bread B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
rozines I-TARGET
is O
perfect!! O

Friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
top O
pastry!!! B-TARGET

super O
delicious, O
super O
sexy, O
original O
patisserie B-TARGET
with O
super O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
nothing O
more O
to O
say O
about...and O
in O
terms O
of O
price, O
for O
quality O
you O
pay O
and O
in O
that O
sense O
they O
are O
even O
cheap O
:-) O

Books B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
great! O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
very O
fresh, O
spacious O
enough, O
wide O
choice, O
very O
delicious O
coffee B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
milk. I-TARGET

So O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
superb. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
smooth! O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
spontaneous. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is O
fun O
too! O

You O
sit O
between O
the O
books O
that O
are O
well O
arranged. O

Books O
can O
also O
be O
purchased. O

Also O
fun O
too! O

For O
Brisbane, O
this O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
added O
value! O

Congratulations O
to O
the O
exploiters. O

We O
are O
pleased O
to O
have O
discovered O
Books B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Brunch!!! I-TARGET

Books B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
things O
Bruges O
has O
to O
offer. O

I O
discovered O
this O
place O
when O
it O
recently O
opened, O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
this O
cozy O
and O
atmospheric O
establishment, B-TARGET
and O
am O
still. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is, O
of O
course, O
something O
unique O
in O
Bruges O
and O
something O
that O
you O
always O
turn O
out O
to O
look O
through O
the O
books, O
regardless O
of O
the O
reason O
for O
visiting. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
fresh O
and O
you O
taste O
that O
it O
is O
not O
forced. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
at O
Books O
& O
Brunch O
is O
so O
delicious, O
you O
come O
for O
lunch, O
coffee O
or O
tea. O

There O
reigns O
an O
optimal O
conviviality, O
calmness O
and O
everything O
is O
not O
forced O
and O
done O
comfortably O
without O
appearing O
lax. O

The B-TARGET
lady I-TARGET
who O
takes O
advantage O
of O
the O
case O
deserves O
a O
mention O
for O
kindness. O

Great O
place B-TARGET
to O
come O
for O
lunch O
with O
your O
girlfriend, O
mom O
or O
comrade O
or O
to O
just O
come O
for O
a O
delicious O
tea B-TARGET
or I-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
and O
by O
browsing O
a O
book O
or O
enjoying O
the O
free O
wifi O
with O
the O
MacBook O
or O
iPhone. O

Books B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
pearl O
among O
all O
the O
tourist O
restaurants O
and O
cafes O
that O
dominate O
Bruges. O

Very O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
very O
nice O
home-made B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
tea. I-TARGET

Only O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
so O
limited O
in O
terms O
of O
food, O
otherwise O
we O
would O
have O
eaten O
a O
snack O
too. O

As O
vegetarians, O
it’s O
all O
but O
obvious O
to O
find O
a O
good O
restaurant, O
where O
one O
doesn’t O
assume O
that O
‘vegetarian’ O
simply O
means O
that O
you O
just O
let O
the O
meat O
out O
of O
it. O

For O
all O
people O
with O
the O
same O
problem, O
here O
is O
the O
solution. O

After O
some O
search O
on O
the O
internet, O
we O
finally O
booked O
here O
for O
Sunday O
night, O
with O
2 O

Eventually O
it O
wasn’t O
busy O
that O
night, O
but O
if O
I O
read O
the O
other O
reviews O
like O
that, O
it’s O
still O
safer O
to O
book! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
sincere, O
and O
that O
is O
really O
a O
lot O
more O
pleasant O
than O
too O
chic O
and O
forced. O

Thro O
the O
evening O
we O
were O
also O
explicitly O
asked O
if O
everything O
was O
as O
desired, O
without O
forcing O
the O
service B-TARGET
too O
much. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
also O
provides O
a O
relaxing O
evening. O

We O
chose O
the O
vegetarian B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
definitely O
worth O
it! O

The O
fun O
was O
a O
tapenade B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
olives I-TARGET
and O
was O
really O
surprisingly O
delicious! O

We O
had O
also O
got O
some O
bread O
with O
olive O
oil, O
which O
within O
5 O
minutes. O

It’s O
always O
nice O
when O
you O
don’t O
have O
to O
wait O
long. O

The O
two O
dishes B-TARGET
also O
fell O
in O
the O
taste, O
but O
especially O
the O
heart O
de B-TARGET
boeuf I-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
has O
stayed O
in O
mind! O

This O
was O
served O
with O
melon O
and O
is O
a O
very O
original O
vegetarian O
variant O
on O
the O
classic O
Spanish O
ham O
with O
melon. O

For O
the O
main O
dish, O
the O
vegan B-TARGET
lasagne, I-TARGET
again, O
it O
does O
not O
assume O
that O
"we O
just O
leave O
the O
meat O
away". O

This O
was O
really O
a O
full-fledged O
dish, B-TARGET
and O
finished O
with O
a O
pesto B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
basil, I-TARGET
which O
was O
delicious O
enough O
to O
eat O
on O
its O
own. O

As O
dessert O
then O
chosen O
the O
vegan B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
and O
although O
this O
is O
indeed O
something O
very O
different O
from O
what O
you O
expect, O
we O
were O
kindly O
warned O
for O
it O
before, O
it O
is O
really O
a O
recommendation! O

A O
really O
pure O
chocolate B-TARGET
taste, I-TARGET
which O
goes O
super O
well O
in O
combination O
with O
the O
orange O
slices O
served. O

In O
short, O
if O
you O
come O
out O
here O
you O
have O
really O
eaten O
for O
your O
money. O

The O
large O
portions, B-TARGET
the O
hospitable O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
chef B-TARGET
who O
clearly O
mastered O
cooking O
without O
meat O
or O
fish O
are O
worth O
the O
price. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
here O
at O
least O
once, O
maybe O
to O
try O
out O
the O
beautiful O
terrace? B-TARGET

never O
again!!!!!!, O
my O
animals O
get O
better O
food!!!!, O
only O
the O
money O
counts O
stay O
away O
and O
go O
elsewhere O
where O
it O
is O
definitely O
much O
better O
no O
price/quality!!!! O

That O
something B-TARGET
like O
this O
can O
still O
be O
open O
in O
our O
beautiful O
city, O
I O
don’t O
understand. O

It O
is O
a O
shame O
to O
drink O
there. O

Cola B-TARGET
40cl O
€5,80, O
for O
the O
bridge O
€3, O
fortunately... O

Jupiler B-TARGET
25cl O
€4.00 O
White B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
€7.00 O
Coffee B-TARGET
€2.50 O
this O
can O
be O
more O
or O
less O
through O
the O
beugle. O

Hopefully O
they O
don’t O
talk O
to O
people O
to O
eat O
anything O
because O
this O
is O
forbidden O
in O
Bruges. O

We O
will O
monitor O
this. O

Definitely O
a O
recommendation!! O

Smooth O

Tell O
me O
I O
said O
it!! O

The O
soup B-TARGET
from O
the O
daily O
menu O
stood O
stiff O
of O
the O
salt. O

A O
cup O
of O
hot O
water O
was O
offered O
as O
a O
solution. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
a O
rose O
of O
broccoli O
was O
all O
vegetables. B-TARGET

During O
the O
cleaning, O
the O
sauce O
was O
scratched O
over O
my O
clothes. O

No O
decent O
excuses O
offered O
or O
small O
compensation. O

Go O
around O
it O
with O
a O
large O
bow. O

Never O
before O
in O
such O
a O
dirty O
and O
messy O
McDonald's B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
have O
been O
definitely O
a O
disrader. O

They O
should O
close O
this O
case. B-TARGET

We O
went O
there O
to O
quickly O
satisfy O
our O
hunger, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
5 O
hamburgers: O
15-20 O
minutes. O

For O
the O
rest, O
we O
noticed O
that O
not O
the O
entire O
price B-TARGET
line I-TARGET
(such O
as O
euro O
deals) O
was O
clear O
somewhere. O

a O
very O
oily O

dirty O

I O
have O
already O
noticed O
several O
times O
that O
the O
black-haired B-TARGET
lesbian I-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
"accidentally" O
returns O
exchange O
money O
too O
little. O

Also O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
table O
I O
heard O
people O
advertise O
that O
they O
had O
received O
a O
deficit O
of O
ten O
euros O
back. O

This O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
coincidence. O

A O
lot O
of O
nostalgia O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
where, O
among O
others, O
carnival O
stampers O
are O
on O
the O
map. O

Menu B-TARGET
at O
an O
attractive O
price. O

Many O
stairs O
are O
not O
as O
convenient O
for O
people O
with O
locomotive O
problems. O

Very O
friendly O
people. B-TARGET

Since O
we O
have O
a O
second O
house O
in O
Knokke O
I O
am O
looking O
for O
a O
nice O
lunch O
restaurant/brasserie. O

The B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
looked O
good, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
clean. O

It B-TARGET
was I-TARGET
too O
expensive O
for O
what O
was O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
chicken B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
could O
be O
a O
better O
mix O
and O
the O
fries B-TARGET
I O
just O
didn’t O
like. O

The O
settlement O
took O
very O
long O
while O
it O
was O
not O
busy O
in O
the O
case. O

Look O
for O
a O
lunch O
address. O

Welcome, B-TARGET
press O
on O
this O
Saturday O
night. O

Menu B-TARGET
at O
an O
acceptable O
price. O

Garneliers B-TARGET
made O
at O
home. O

Half B-TARGET
of O
a O
minimum O
portion. O

and O
fast O
service. B-TARGET

We O
got O
what O
we O
expected, O
but O
no O
more. O

The O
lunch B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
price-quality O
very O
good. O

Good O
choice B-TARGET
and O
large O
portions. B-TARGET

Garnaalkroket B-TARGET
where O
you O
don’t O
have O
to O
look O
for O
the O
garnals. O

Friendly O
service, B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
olives B-TARGET
at O
the O
apero O
;) O

Really O
recommended O
and O
worth O
repeating. O

The O
fireworks O
festival O
in O
Knokke O
is O
always O
busy. O

The O
terrace O
of O
the O
lodge O
is O
also O
well O
filled. O

When O
we O
find O
a O
place, O
we O
are O
promptly O
desired O
success O
by O
our O
table O
neighbors. O

When O
we O
called O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
he O
came O
to O
pick O
up O
our O
order, O
but O
when O
it O
turned O
out O
we O
were O
new O
clients, O
he O
canceled O
the O
recorded O
order O
and O
told O
us O
that O
he O
will O
first O
serve O
his O
existing O
clients O
before O
he O
will O
serve O
us. O

When O
calling O
a O
2nd O
waitress, B-TARGET
we O
had O
even O
less O
success O
because O
he O
does O
not O
know O
the O
Dutch O
language O
and O
ran O
there O
for O
speck O
and O
beans. O

After O
a O
quarter-hour O
of O
patience O
to O
see O
the O
crowd O
of O
the O
evening, O
and O
the O
strangely O
under-equipped O
staff O
and O
already O
a O
number O
of O
tables O
to O
see O
go O
back, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
comes O
to O
clean O
up O
our O
overcrowded O
table, O
in O
which O
we O
make O
a O
third O
attempt O
to O
order, O
and O
the O
waitress O
after O
having O
had O
30min O
patience O
urges O
us O
to O
want O
to O
wait O
another O
15 O
minutes. O

He O
prefers O
to O
play O
the O
"pest O
the O
kitchen" O
game, O
in O
which O
he O
first O
wants O
to O
clean O
up O
all O
his O
tables, O
then O
in O
5 O
minutes O
time O
to O
get O
the O
order O
of O
food O
and O
drink O
from O
a O
number O
of O
15 O
new O
tables. O

Tough O
for O
the O
chef O
and O
also O
tough O
for O
himself, O
he O
will O
be O
allowed O
to O
serve O
15 O
dishes O
at O
a O
time, O
15 O
tables O
with O
drinks O
at O
a O
time, O
and O
15 O
tables O
at O
a O
time. O

Since O
we O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
patience, O
we O
had O
hoped O
for O
a O
price O
of O
"boiling O
points" O
but O
unfortunately. O

After O
walking O
further O
down O
the O
dike O
we O
then O
stopped O
at O
the O
next O
restaurant O
"waterl'eau" O
where O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
sit O
immediately O
if O
we O
would O
also O
eat O
something O
given O
the O
crowd O
of O
people O
that O
evening. O

We O
quickly O
got O
our O
aperitif, O
were O
friendly O
served, O
and O
quickly O
got O
our O
food. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later O
we O
saw O
half O
the O
terrace O
of O
'the O
lodge' O
nesting O
on O
our O
terrace O
at O
'waterl'eau'. O

I O
will O
never O
go O
to O
the B-TARGET
lodge I-TARGET
again. O

Despite O
the O
age O
of O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
you O
should O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
he O
already O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
experience, O
however, O
I’t O
want O
to O
have O
such O
a O
board O
in O
my O
case. O

In O
addition, O
the O
case O
should O
also O
realize O
that O
1 O
waitress O
for O
such O
a O
terrace O
is O
unattainable! O

If O
I O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
40 O
minutes O
for O
one O
drink O
or O
for O
my O
meal, O
I O
don’t O
think O
this O
is O
still O
normal. O

After O
a O
bicycle O
ride O
in O
the O
west O
corner, O
a O
good O
meal O
at O
Capella. O

A O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
pressure O
of O
the O
Big O
Market. O

At O
our O
request, O
a O
table O
was O
placed O
on O
the O
terrace. O

A O
surprisingly O
delicious O
snack B-TARGET
with O
the O
aperitif O
and O
delicious O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
scampi. I-TARGET

Suitable O
for O
repetition. O

We O
ate O
here, O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
very O
good O
price/quality O
ratio. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
time O
this O
year O
in O
this O
super O
restaurant. B-TARGET

This O
time O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends. O

As O
always, O
it O
is O
here O
to O
enjoy O
sublime O
taste B-TARGET
combinations I-TARGET
and O
delicious O
matching B-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

We O
are O
always O
surprised O
by O
the O
exquisite O
cuisine. B-TARGET

A O
cool O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
without O
much O
tralala, O
good O
food B-TARGET
for O
the O
best O
price O
quality. O

Sometimes O
loud, O
sometimes O
loud O
when O
there O
are O
large O
companies O
at O
a O
table. O

Yes, O
it’s O
a O
student, O
and O
that’s O
what O
you O
do. O

What O
seemed O
fun O
at O
first O
became O
a O
disappointingly O
bad O
experience. O

Fee O
for O
15 O
euros? O

Forget O
about O
it! O

For O
less O
than O
$20 O
you O
won’t O
get O
it. O

We O
were O
guided O
in O
by O
a O
man B-TARGET
who O
ordered O
us O
to O
take O
place O
in O
the O
filled O
part O
of O
the O
rest. O

I O
really O
did O
not O
like O
that O
man. B-TARGET

Looking O
around O
the O
room, O
I O
decided O
not O
to O
eat O
mushrooms O
and O
no O
steaks O
either. O

I O
did O
not O
trust O
the O
case B-TARGET
immediately. O

I O
opted O
for O
a O
spaghetti O
and O
a O
karafi B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
that O
tasted O
sour. O

I O
don’t O
know O
what O
I O
ate, O
but O
I O
didn’t O
think O
it O
was O
cooker. O

The O
blow O
to O
the O
arrow O
came O
when O
I O
wanted O
to O
settle O
with O
bank O
contact O
or O
visa. O

This O
was O
not O
possible O
according O
to O
the O
manager. O

It O
had O
to O
be O
cash. O

Yes, O
there O
you O
have O
it, O
I O
thought... O

Fraudsters O
of O
the O
first O
order. O

So O
I O
left O
my O
wife O
and O
child O
to O
walk O
500 O
meters O
to O
collect O
money. O

When O
I O
alerted O
the O
owner B-TARGET
that O
these O
were O
very O
foolish O
practices, O
she O
made O
a O
scene O
and O
refused O
to O
give O
me O
exchange O
money. O

I O
thought O
I O
would O
get O
sick O
that O
night. O

I O
repeatedly O
asked O
my O
wife, O
“What O
have O
I O
eaten?” O

I O
would O
like O
to O
know!” O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
an O
outlet. O

Such O
places B-TARGET
should O
be O
closed O
immediately. O

Nothing O
is O
good. O

It O
is O
terrible! O

This O
was O
my O
biggest O
counterattack O
ever O
in O
terms O
of O
take-away. B-TARGET

We O
stayed O
in O
Sunparks O
and O
wanted O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
pizza O
in O
Nieuwpoort. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
the O
toping B-TARGET
and O
the O
price O
was O
a O
counterpart. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
very O
poorly O
filled O
and O
the O
taste O
was O
very O
faint. O

I O
also O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
prices O
at O
the O
restaurant O
while O
picking B-TARGET
up I-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
was O
cheaper O
in O
the O
folder. O

I O
only O
saw O
this O
when O
I O
arrived O
at O
the O
Sunparks O
house. O

This O
has O
been O
my O
biggest O
misfortune O
ever O
and O
I O
will O
definitely O
not O
go O
back O
here! O

I O
ordered O
a O
brunch, O
food B-TARGET
was O
tip-top, O
drink B-TARGET
enough. O

Others O
were O
eating B-TARGET
us I-TARGET
too. I-TARGET

The O
old O
cafe O
was O
pleasant O
and O
honest. O

Now O
it O
is O
a O
reader O
without O
character. O

At O
11:30 O
p.m. O
the O
seats O
are O
placed O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
table. O

This O
is O
a O
sign O
that O
you O
can O
leave O
slowly. O

One O
and B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
half I-TARGET
is O
only O
1/3th O
of O
the O
triple O
supplemented O
with O
trappist O
from O
the O
vessel. O

And O
it O
is O
too O
expensive O
here. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
this O
has O
evolved O
so... O

I O
can O
say O
little O
about O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
the O
strawberries B-TARGET
are O
quite O
expensive O
in O
proportion. O

We O
are O
more O
than O
satisfied O
with O
our O
evening O
in O
the O
Gempemolen. B-TARGET

We O
were O
warmly O
welcomed O
and O
very O
friendly O
served O
throughout O
the O
evening. O

We O
chose O
after O
the O
soup O
with O
its O
celebration O
for O
the O
pork B-TARGET
shaft: I-TARGET
juicy O
and O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
delicious O
vegetables. B-TARGET

One O
person O
chose O
a O
vegetarian B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
and O
she O
was O
also O
very O
excited. O

We O
had O
all O
the O
time O
to O
eat O
quietly O
and O
really O
it. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
the O
cherry O
on O
the O
cake. O

Price/quality O
is O
a O
great O
recommendation!!! O

Although O
this O
Brasserie B-TARGET
is O
exploited O
by O
the O
Meus O
Clan, O
it O
does O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations. O

Environment B-TARGET
and O
interior B-TARGET
are O
more O
than O
ok, O
food B-TARGET
is O
to O
be O
less O
excited O
about. O

Sadly O

Here O
you O
will O
find O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
lots O
of O
customers O
and O
enthusiasm O
prepared O
and O
served O
with O
style. O

Obtaining O
a O
Michelin O
star O
has O
not O
raised O
Lieven B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Iris I-TARGET
to O
the O
head. O

The O
prices O
are O
always O
correct O
and O
even O
very O
low. O

In O
short, O
everyone O
there! O

Even O
though O
we O
didn’t O
reserve, O
we O
got O
a O
table O
on O
a O
busy O
night. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
served O
at O
an O
acceptable O
time, O
and O
everything O
was O
as O
expected. O

Maybe O
choose O
to O
serve O
a O
little O
less O
lumpy O
fries B-TARGET
(without O
any O
extra O
price O
:-)) O

For O
the O
rest, O
everything O
was O
desired. O

We O
got O
a O
delicious O
dish B-TARGET
in O
no O
time. O

Everything O
was O
fresh O
and O
enough. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly. O

At O
the O
entrance O
it O
was O
not O
very O
friendly. O

It O
was O
pretty O
busy. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
turned O
incredibly O
against O
his O
staff. O

Six O
of O
them O
immediately O
left. O

By O
circumstances, O
I O
have O
been O
here O
with O
various O
friends O
three O
times O
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
few O
weeks O
and O
have O
been O
able O
to O
taste O
both O
a O
lunch O
(outdoors), O
a O
la O
carte O
and O
a O
menu. O

Everyone O
agreed O
that O
Le B-TARGET
Kok I-TARGET
is O
really O
a O
special O
property O
in O
the O
area O
of O
De O
Haan. O

The O
chef B-TARGET
has O
clearly O
found O
a O
golden O
middle O
way O
to O
not O
only O
decorate O
the O
beautiful O
presentations, O
but O
also O
to O
perfectly O
decorate O
the O
flavors. O

Really O
very O
sophisticated O
in O
all O
respects. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
quiet. O

Although O
not O
specified, O
one O
can O
park O
at O
the O
adjacent O
plants O
and O
garden O
business. O

The O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
good. O

Very O
professional O
guest B-TARGET
woman I-TARGET
and O
good O
service, B-TARGET
although O
once O
the O
principle, O
first-in, O
first-served O
was O
not O
applied O
probably O
by O
the O
crowd. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
even O
here, O
the O
more O
common O
rule O
money: O
that O
with O
four O
or O
all O
à O
la O
carte O
or O
all O
menu O
chooses. O

But O
that O
won’t O
stop O
me O
from O
coming O
back. O

We O
ate O
very O
well O
here. O

Restaurant B-TARGET
with O
open O
kitchen O
and O
quiet O
setting. O

Will O
definitely O
come O
back O
here. O

Mosseling O
with O
fries B-TARGET
ordered, O
fries O
simply O
sluggish O
and O
fat, O
no O
mossel B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
because O
the O
chef B-TARGET
was O
bad-minded, O
mayo B-TARGET
with O
pieces,... O
m O
iron O
man O
was O
still O
good! O

after O
another O
question O
we O
got O
vinegar O
with O
some O
dressing O
in, O
again O
back O
and O
mayo B-TARGET
asked O
and O
we O
got O
mayo O
with O
pieces O
and O
condition, O
still O
es O
back, O
my O
husband O
says O
jamaar O
customer O
is O
still O
king, O
disgraceful O
and O
the O
answer O
of O
the O
chef, B-TARGET
jamaar O
I O
am O
emperor! O

He O
continued O
to O
scream! O

And O
the O
man O
says O
as O
it O
is, O
we’re O
just O
gone! O

Man O
comes O
out, O
I O
say O
good O
come O
the O
children O
are O
hungry, O
just O
eat, O
come O
one B-TARGET
out O

now O

Pay O

They O
say O
we O
are O
still O
eating! O

He O
starts O
throwing O
the O
chair!!! O

Man O
paid O
and O
garcon B-TARGET
takes O
all O
the O
food O
away!!!! O

Then O
suddenly O
all O
the O
service, O
boss O
and O
boss O
by O

The B-TARGET
boss I-TARGET

baseball O

next O
to O
me!!!!!! O

..80€ O
lost, O
evening O
to O
the O
tricks O
and O
parents O
and O
children O
shocked!!! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
could O
not O
be O
better! O

Per O
1 O
minus O
point O
the O
lady B-TARGET
just O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
a O
coffee O
(although O
we O
were O
with O
4 O
without O
asking O
the O
other O
tablemates O
too O
that O
question, O
she O
was O
also O
a O
little O
quick O
away) O
so O
everyone O
got O
coffee. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
should O
be O
a O
little O
more O
calm. O

Other O
top! O

Very O
nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
perfect, O
nothing O
to O
notice. O

Very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

The O
frites B-TARGET
are O
hand O
cut. O

We O
will O
return. O

We O
were O
welcomed O
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
well O
furnished. O

At O
the O
aperitif O
came O
a O
whole O
series O
of O
beautiful O
and O
delicious O
snacks. B-TARGET

The O
menu B-TARGET
itself O
was O
of O
the O
same O
level, O
without O
a O
single O
minus. O

My O
wife O
asked O
custom B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
in O
small O
amounts, O
which O
they O
spontaneously O
served, O
and O
subsequently O
a O
very O
correct O
price O
for O
calculated. O

Chapeau O
for O
everything. O

Enjoy O
a O
wonderful O
evening O
at O
The B-TARGET
Bistronomy! I-TARGET

Amazing O
taste B-TARGET
combinations I-TARGET
beautifully O
presented O
on O
the O
perfect O
plate! O

Looking O
for O
a O
unique O
overall O
experience? O

This B-TARGET
is O
the O
place O
to O
be! O

Our O
company O
has O
been O
able O
to O
get O
acquainted O
with O
the O
surprising O
tricks O
of O
the O
robot B-TARGET
hostess, I-TARGET
never O
seen O
before! O

This O
is O
my O
2nd O
assessment. O

Terrible O
this O
time. O

We O
were O
there O
at O
7:30 O
p.m. O
and O
at O
10 O
p.m. O
they O
come O
and O
say O
they O
forgot O
your O
order. O

After O
all O
these O
negative O
reviews. O

Leave O
it O
to O
the O
left. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
was O
always O
giving O
the O
3xcuses O
a O
h. O

There O
is O
no O
manager. O

Short O
summary: O
unmanipulated, O
unprofessional O
operation B-TARGET

very O
poor O
eating B-TARGET

the O
next O
day). O

Short O
summary: O
unmanipulated, O
unprofessional O
operation B-TARGET
and O
very O
poor O
eating B-TARGET
(sick O
the O
next O
day). O

We O
went O
to O
the O
Chi-Chi’s O
chain O
more O
often O
in O
other O
communities O
and O
were O
generally O
satisfied. O

Chi-Chi’s B-TARGET
Wemmel I-TARGET
recently O
opened O
its O
doors, O
because O
the O
quality O
is O
so O
low. O

Tip O
to O
the O
buyer: O
Training O
staff B-TARGET
(both O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
hall) O
if O
you O
want O
to O
keep O
the O
case O
open. O

It O
is O
sad O
to O
eat O
there! O

We O
were O
there O
with O
a O
Flair O
bon O
(buffet O
+ O
alcohol-free O
cocktail O
for O
€8). O

We O
arrived O
and O
first O
had O
to O
wait O
about O
five O
minutes O
until O
there O
was O
anything O
of O
staff B-TARGET
going O
around O
in O
the O
hall. O

We O
had O
booked O
and O
wanted O
to O
know O
where O
we O
could O
sit. O

In O
the O
end, O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
choose O
ourselves O
and O
we O
just O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
only O
table O
where O
no O
dirty O
plates O
were O
on O
the O
table O
and O
where O
the O
tables O
were O
cut O
off. O

We O
found O
this O
quite O
unpleasant. O

Then O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
another O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
until O
(French) O
cards O
were O
brought. O

Then O
another O
20 O
minutes O
before O
the O
staff B-TARGET
had O
done O
with O
talking O
and O
had O
time O
to O
take O
our O
order. O

We O
had O
the O
buffet O
and O
a O
non-alcoholic O
cocktail. O

We O
got O
the O
cocktail O
when O
we O
were O
almost O
finished O
with O
food O
(and O
we O
are O
not O
really O
fast-eaters). O

The O
buffet B-TARGET
was O
sad. O

Choose O
from O
5 O
hot O
dishes O
and O
a O
host O
of O
cold O
dishes. O

Almost O
everything O
was O
gone, O
and O
what O
was O
left O
was O
dried, O
baked, O
or O
already O
cold. O

After O
we O
had O
empty O
our O
first O
plate, O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
out O
again. O

I O
couldn’t, O
because O
it O
was O
all O
over. O

And O
we O
could O
not O
have O
taken O
much O
the O
first O
time O
because O
there O
was O
not O
much O
already. O

My O
friend O
has O
asked O
several O
times O
in O
Dutch O
when O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
filled O
up, O
only O
to O
hear O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
does O
not O
understand O
Dutch. O

Then O
they O
tried O
in O
French O
and O
then O
they O
went O
"to O
see O
if O
it O
could O
be O
filled O
up." O

We O
waited O
for O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
we O
left O
hungry. O

In O
addition, O
we O
both O
have O
been O
sick O
for O
3 O
days O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
obviously O
not O
kept O
at O
a O
hygienic O
temperature O
in O
the O
buffet. O

They O
are O
also O
very O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
girl B-TARGET
who O
expressly O
crawled O
over O
our O
table O
(and O
sometimes O
just O
stood O
down) O
because O
she O
didn’t O
want O
to O
speak O
Dutch. O

And O
this O
while O
there O
were O
dirty O
plates O
everywhere O
and O
we O
had O
been O
waiting O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time. O

In O
addition, O
the O
wipes B-TARGET
on O
our O
table O
were O
already O
used O
and O
just O
folded O
up O
again O
and O
the O
cards B-TARGET
were O
very O
sticky. O

First O
and O
last O
time! O

Very O
nice, O
perfect O
service, B-TARGET
very O
sophisticated O
dishes! B-TARGET

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back. O

Person O
X O
from O
Y. O

A O
birthday O
party O
today. O

So O
enjoy O
eating O
together. O

Table O
reserved O
and O
then O
enjoy O
but, O
we O
thought. O

At O
the O
table O
at O
18:00. O

After O
we O
had O
found O
the O
menus O
ourselves, O
we O
asked O
at O
half O
seven O
if O
we O
could O
order. O

Ten O
minutes O
later O
I O
asked O
again. O

The O
preliminary B-TARGET
was O
OK. O

At O
the O
main O
court O
they O
could O
then O
wait O
three O
quarters O
of O
hours O
after O
repeated O
inquiries. O

Small O
portions, B-TARGET
half O
raw O
meat, B-TARGET
in O
short: O
worthless. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
leaves, O
the O
fries B-TARGET
out O
of O
the O
freezes. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
unfriendly, O
always O
begins O
to O
discuss O
with O
the O
guests. O

My O
second O
Lefe B-TARGET
came O
out O
of O
the O
container O
in O
a O
bottle! O

In O
other O
words, O
really O
worthless. O

Never O
again. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
large O
group O
but O
the O
different O
choices O
of O
the O
participants O
were O
passed O
on O
in O
advance. O

The O
leaflet O
of O
the O
queen's O
ham O
was O
top O
the O
rest B-TARGET
was O
not O
to O
write O
over O
home O
prefab O
hack O
balls, O
little O
sauce, O
no O
mushroom O
to O
spot, O
a O
little O
chicken O
the O
fries O
were O
below O
all O
level, O
tasteless O
cardboard O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
other O
options O
nearby, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
with O
a O
small O
company O
also O
for O
larger O
companies O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
within O
Maaseik. O

Beautiful O
quiet O
decoration, B-TARGET
beautiful O
food, O
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
but O
above O
all O
very O
delicious O
dishes! B-TARGET

With O
the O
5 O
courses O
I O
would O
have O
more O
than O
enough O
and O
had O
but O
we O
went O
for O
the O
7 O
with O
adapted O
wines. O
