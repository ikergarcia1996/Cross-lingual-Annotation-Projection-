Long O
wait. B-TARGET

Same O
dessert, B-TARGET
two O
days O
after O
each O
other. O

Unbearable B-TARGET
buffet I-TARGET
was O
great. O

It's O
not O
cheap. O

Via O
via, O
we O
had O
heard O
that O
we O
had O
to O
be O
here O
for O
Wagye O
beef. O

Our O
GPS O
wasn't O
the O
best O
guide O
to O
get O
to O
Altembrouck O
Castle. O

But O
once O
we O
got O
to O
the O
castle B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
it O
became O
a O
party. O

First O
of O
all, O
the O
operator, B-TARGET
who's O
extremely O
friendly, O
does O
not O
act O
compulsively, O
but O
really. O

I've O
been O
there O
many O
times, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
wonderful O
chemistry O
going O
on O
between O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

You O
have O
a O
choice O
between O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
menus. B-TARGET

Specialization O
is O
Wagye O
cattle. O

When O
you O
ask O
for O
explanations O
about O
this O
delicious O
beef, B-TARGET
the O
meat O
is O
actually O
presented O
to O
you O
on O
a O
plate. O

It's O
not O
that O
it's O
cheap, O
but O
it's O
extraordinarily O
delicious. O

If O
you're O
not O
a O
steak O
lover, O
there's O
a O
fisherman, B-TARGET
duck B-TARGET
and O
goat B-TARGET
at O
acceptable O
prices. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
is O
a O
good O
selection O
of O
delicious, O
high-quality O
wines. B-TARGET

It O
was O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
that O
we O
ate O
so O
well. O

On O
the O
border O
between O
the O
Netherlands O
and O
Belgium, O
we O
ate O
exceptionally O
well O
in O
an O
atmosphere B-TARGET
with O
a O
live O
band O
that O
found O
the O
right O
tone O
and O
gave O
us O
a O
delicious O
afternoon. O

This O
is O
the O
third O
time O
we've O
eaten O
here. O

It's O
a O
fantastic O
opportunity. B-TARGET

If O
it's O
nice O
outside O
on O
the O
courtyard O
or O
at O
the O
pond, O
eat O
or O
drink. O

On O
the O
Altembrouck O
estate, O
they're O
working O
with O
fresh, O
fair O
products. B-TARGET

So O
they O
have O
maize O
pigs O
and O
wagyu O
cattle. O

There's O
no O
menu B-TARGET
card. I-TARGET

On O
Sundays, O
there's O
a O
three-course B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
at O
27,50, O
which O
is O
really O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

The O
downside O
is, O
there's O
no O
menu B-TARGET
card, I-TARGET
not O
even O
a O
daily O
menu O
card. O

If O
the O
host O
has O
listed O
what O
to O
eat, O
before O
he O
or O
she O
finishes O
the O
dessert, O
you O
lose O
the O
main O
course. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
correct O
without O
being O
rigid. O

I'm O
just O
sorry O
about O
the O
last O
time O
they O
called O
both O
pork O
and O
beef O
their O
main O
dish, O
and O
our O
whole O
table O
was O
surprised O
that O
they O
didn't O
ask O
us O
what O
our O
preference O
was. O

Asked, O
unfortunately, O
the O
beef O
was O
already O
sold O
out. O

Furthermore, O
and O
very O
flexible, O
three O
people O
wanted O
to O
go O
[with O
a O
surcharge] O
for O
the O
breakfast O
buffet. O

And O
that's O
what O
happened. O

And O
yet, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
recommendation O
to O
put O
at O
least O
something O
like O
a O
snack O
menu O
on O
the O
website. O

Now O
you O
have O
to O
call O
back O
or O
email O
back, O
that's O
not O
very O
commercial. O

For O
the O
rest, O
nothing O
like O
praise. O

So O
delicious, O
imaginatively O
cooked O
food B-TARGET
in O
a O
very O
nice O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

I O
can O
only O
recommend O
this. O

If O
you O
come O
here O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
or O
a O
salad, O
it's O
great. O

Just O
do O
it O
once O
and O
you'll O
be O
surprised. O

Sadly, O
such O
a O
thing, B-TARGET
beautifully O
located, O
good O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
the O
kindness O
of O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
disgrace O
and O
unforgiving, O

We O
had O
a O
Swiss O
guest O
at O
home. O

He O
was O
delighted O
and O
surprised O
by O
the O
tour O
that O
he O
had O
been O
given O
in O
Halle. O

For O
instance, O
Cardijn O
spent O
his O
childhood O
in O
Halle, O
the O
beautiful O
St. O
Martin's O
Basilica. O

He O
knew O
the O
music O
of O
Servais, O
but O
he O
didn't O
know O
Servais O
was O
still O
singing O
here. O

The O
idea O
of O
ending O
this O
beautiful O
evening O
with O
a O
dinner O
at O
the O
Grand B-TARGET
Cafe I-TARGET
was O
a O
real O
deterrent O
to O
your O
well-being. O

I O
thought O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
had O
just O
been O
fired. O

It's O
so O
uncomfortable O
on O
the O
inside. O

Apparently O
he's O
still O
working O
on O
it. O
He O
certainly O
hasn't O
gotten O
much O
more O
sympathetic. O

It O
doesn't O
really O
eat B-TARGET
much O
either, O
or O
the O
operator B-TARGET
has O
a O
role O
to O
play O
here. O

As O
long O
as O
that O
waiter B-TARGET
is O
there, O
I'm O
not O
seen O
again. O

We O
had O
nine O
people O
come O
and O
have O
a O
bite O
to O
eat. O

What O
a O
horrific O
experience. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
totally O
rude, O
and O
he O
did O
everything O
he O
could O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
he O
didn't O
make O
any O
sense O
to O
serve O
us. O

When O
we O
said, O
yes, O
if O
it's O
too O
hard O
to O
serve, O
we O
couldn't O
finish O
our O
sentence, O
but O
we O
were O
screamed O
at O
the O
ear O
of O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
then O
turned O
around O
and O
left. O

The O
other O
clients, O
loudly, O
said O
it O
was O
outrageous O
and O
unbelievable O
to O
see O
a O
group O
of O
nine O
people O
marching O
out O
so O
clearly. O

Any O
other O
restaurant O
with O
any O
dignity O
would O
receive O
nine O
customers O
at O
nine O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
with O
their O
arms O
open. O

If O
this O
case B-TARGET
isn't O
going O
to O
make O
headway, O
it's O
not O
about O
the O
crisis. O

Owner, O
teach O
your O
staff B-TARGET
ways. O

We O
come O
here O
for O
dinner O
more O
often: O
decent O
brasseries B-TARGET
no O
more. O

Everything's O
fine, O
but O
you O
never O
get O
a O
real O
"wow" O
feeling. O

Clearly, O
it's O
a O
fixed O
client O
base, O
and O
it's O
satisfied O
with O
that. O

In O
short, O
you O
will O
never O
be O
disappointed, O
but O
you O
will O
never O
be O
in O
the O
clouds O
either. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
got O
free O
choice O
of O
tapa B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
from O
us, O
and O
she O
ate O
them O
quickly, O
and O
although O
everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
good O
quality, O
I O
was O
lacking O
in O
refinement. O

We O
said O
at O
the O
beginning O
we O
liked O
the O
combination O
of O
tapa O
and O
fish, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
mention O
of O
it O
at O
all: O
iberico, B-TARGET
chorizo, B-TARGET
mango, B-TARGET
Russian B-TARGET
eggs, I-TARGET
mushrooms, B-TARGET
tomatoes, I-TARGET
tomato O
sauce O
with B-TARGET
hazelnuts, I-TARGET
all O
delicious, O
but O
not O
authentic. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
most O
expensive O
bottle O
at O
a O
modest O
price O
of O
30 O
euros O
-- O

So O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
a O
fun O
time, O
and O
a O
simple O
but O
delicious O
tap√†s. B-TARGET

Management B-TARGET
friendly, O
but O
half-hearted. O

Southern O
sphere... B-TARGET

It's O
fun O
and O
delicious. O

Great O
concept B-TARGET
for O
a O
great O
evening O
in O
Spanish O
decor! O

Definitely O
coming O
back. O

Beautiful O
wines B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Authentic O
recipes B-TARGET
-- O
if O
we're O
a O
bunch O
of O
experts, O
we O
can O
verify O
that O
-- O
and O
everything's O
homemade. O

A O
recommendation O
for O
a O
night O
out! O

Nice O
concept, B-TARGET
very O
delicious O
wines B-TARGET
and O
tapas, B-TARGET
these O
alternate O
regularly, O
sometimes O
very O
good, O
sometimes O
just O
good. O

and O
they're O
always O
coming O
back O
to O
spend O
a O
pleasant O
evening O
with O
a O
snack O
and O
a O
drink, O
and O
sometimes O
the O
staff B-TARGET
could O
be O
quicker, O
but O
think O
of O
this O
as O
a O
fun O
and O
relaxing O
afternoon O
or O
a O
stress-free O
evening. O

Antwerp O
Underground O
is O
a O
great O
city O
for O
gastronomers. O

And O
also O
in O
the O
periphery, O
there O
are O
cute O
little O
things O
like O
Little B-TARGET
Constantia. I-TARGET

Although O
it's O
more O
geared O
towards O
a O
fashionable O
audience O
who O
likes O
to O
eat O
a O
steak, O
this O
timetabled O
restaurant O
offers O
culinary O
paradise O
on O
the O
tables O
for O
gourmets. O

And O
for O
those O
of O
you O
who O
enjoy O
South O
African O
wines O
with O
a O
fruity O
taste, O
try O
Provenance O
Rooi. O

Just O
the O
best O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
neighborhood! O

Being O
fit O
for O
food O
and O
drink O
in O
a O
cushy O
frame. O

It's O
different, O
but O
it's O
so O
good! O

Previous O
visits O
to O
KC B-TARGET
have O
always O
been O
a O
culinary O
highlight. O

Unfortunately, O
that O
can't O
be O
said O
of O
the O
last O
visit. O

Turns O
out O
the O
swing O
is O
what O
it O
looks O
like. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
is O
much O
too O
limited, O
the O
suggestions B-TARGET
are O
gone, O
the O
creativity O
on O
the O
board B-TARGET
is O
gone. O

A O
simple O
salad B-TARGET
as O
an O
appetizer O
doesn't O
immediately O
motivate O
me O
to O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant. O

Amuses B-TARGET
that O
used O
to O
be O
a O
nice O
entry O
are O
now O
limited O
to O
a O
pumpkin O
soup. O

But O
even O
with O
this O
limited O
card B-TARGET
-- O
four O
main O
dishes, O
four O
starters O
and O
two O
desserts O
-- O
there O
weren't O
two O
dishes O
available. O

But O
very O
annoyingly, O
this O
was O
not O
reported O
in O
advance O
when O
the O
menu O
card O
was O
being O
presented. O

Even O
in O
the O
main O
courtroom, O
this O
was O
not O
reported O
until O
the O
moment O
it O
had O
to O
be O
served! O

Here's O
the O
map. O
Just O
pick O
something O
else. O

No, O
these O
are O
three O
steps O
back O
from O
previous O
visits. O

If O
it's O
the O
owner's O
choice O
to O
go O
to O
a O
brewery, O
that's O
his O
choice, O
but O
like O
we're O
betting O
on O
two O
horses O
now, O
it O
just O
doesn't O
work. O

Very O
unfortunate. O

Positive O
though O
it O
remains O
is O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
and O
the O
wide O
variety O
of O
South B-TARGET
African I-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

for O
the O
second O
time. O

This O
time O
it's O
the O
Royal O
all O
in O
menu, O
this O
time O
it's O
the O
all O
in O
menu. O

Top-of-the-line O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
cava O
with O
a O
waiter's O
counter, O
starter, O
main O
course O
and O
dessert, O
or O
Irish O
coffee. O

water O
and O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine, O
including O
for O
32 O
dollars. O

Very O
friendly O
and O
fast O
operation. B-TARGET

A O
recommendation! O

In O
the O
previous O
establishment, O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
on O
the O
restaurant O
level. O

Now, O
it's O
not O
really O
worth O
grading O
at O
all. O

with O
a O
family O
of O
six, O
and O
I O
really O
struggled. O

Let's O
have O
a O
full-au-vent B-TARGET
loaf O
of O
bread O
for O
8.5 O
euros! O

Duration. O

Management B-TARGET
was O
not O
friendly. O

Sphere B-TARGET
was O
fine, O
but O
not O
so O
nice. O

The B-TARGET
Village, I-TARGET
a O
real O
recommendation. O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
great! O

Romantic O
or O
cozy, O
let's O
have O
some O
fun, O
aloof! O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work! O

I O
used O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
southern O
parish O
regularly, O
and O
now O
the O
concept O
has O
shifted O
to O
cafeterias, O
which O
means O
the O
map O
is O
completely O
adapted. O

But O
to O
be O
honest, O
it O
was, O
and O
still O
is, O
top O
food O
in O
the O
world. O

Beautiful O
dress O
on O
the O
thing, B-TARGET
super O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
and O
for O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
see O
it O
on O
the O
map. B-TARGET

What O
I O
personally O
like O
to O
do O
here O
is O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
bowl, I-TARGET
but O
also O
their O
village B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
addition O
of O
sauce, O
their O
mussels B-TARGET
and O
the O
legendary O
Pelt B-TARGET
stew I-TARGET
is O
super O
delicious. O

It's O
also O
the O
ease O
with O
which O
you O
can O
sit O
on O
the O
couch O
or O
sit O
on O
the O
chair O
and O
enjoy O
a O
delicious O
cocktail. B-TARGET
It's O
all O
there. O

Tanja, B-TARGET
you're O
doing O
great! O

We O
wanted O
to O
book O
four O
people O
to O
have O
a O
bite O
at O
the O
southern O
parlor O
before O
(telephone O
didn't O
work O
several O
times)!!!! O

Or O
they O
just O
didn't O
record. O

We O
went O
into O
action, O
and O
we O
left O
boldly O
hoping O
there O
was O
still O
room. O

And O
yes, O
there O
was O
definitely O
a O
place O
-- O
three O
hours O
with O
four O
people O
on O
the O
case O
-- O
but O
we O
were O
very O
well O
received, O
and O
the O
guard B-TARGET
was O
the O
only O
person O
in O
charge O
in O
the O
case. O

And O
the O
thing B-TARGET
is, O
it's O
beautiful, O
but O
it's O
cold, O
because O
there O
was O
no O
people O
to O
be O
entertained, O
and O
they O
just O
ate B-TARGET
SCHANDALIG!!! O

Sla B-TARGET
of O
the O
Dead, O
the O
quality O
was O
bad, O
and O
the O
dress B-TARGET
was O
exactly O
a O
month O
overdue. O

The O
homemade B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
cocktails I-TARGET
came O
from O
the O
macro! O

To O
force O
a O
female B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
member I-TARGET
to O
just O
smoke O
in O
the O
case B-TARGET
is O
all O
very O
unfortunate O
and O
unacceptable O
to O
us O
at O
Wker. O

but O
a O
recommendation O
if O
you're O
worried O
about O
your O
privacy!!! O

both O
the O
concept B-TARGET
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
organic. O

Bart O
the O
owner O
makes O
the O
room, O
and O
a O
chef O
makes O
the O
dishes. O

So O
it's O
a O
little O
card B-TARGET
with O
just O
super-green O
tiles. B-TARGET

The O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
and O
the O
price O
quality O
is O
very, O
very O
good. O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
cheerful O
reception, B-TARGET
the O
best O
steak B-TARGET
turkey I-TARGET
we've O
ever O
eaten O
(you've O
got O
to O
try O
the O
baked B-TARGET
ones, O
too), O
wine B-TARGET
tailored O
to O
your O
taste, O

In O
short, O
an O
absolute O
FAVORITE! O

Great O
restaurant B-TARGET
outside O
the O
real O
center O
of O
Antwerp. O

Nice, O
unobstructed O
ambiance, B-TARGET
few O
shelves B-TARGET
(reservation O
is O
necessary) O
and O
great O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, B-TARGET
and O
it's O
delicious O
to O
surprise O
you O
with O
their O
wine B-TARGET
choices. I-TARGET

It's O
not O
a O
low-cost O
thing, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
a O
high-quality O
thing. O

It's O
an O
absolute O
recommendation. O

In O
the O
afternoon, O
he O
stopped O
for O
coffee. O

And O
yes, O
in O
South O
Antwerp, O
hip O
is O
not O
always O
equal O
to O
quality. O

The O
coffees B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
hot O
chocolates, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
were O
too O
expensive O
and O
were O
served O
too O
cold. O

Now, O
soft O
coffee B-TARGET
is O
just O
not O
acceptable. O

Especially O
since O
the O
case O
was O
as O
good O
as O
empty, O
this O
is O
unacceptable. O

Doesn't O
give O
you O
a O
good O
impression O
that O
your O
towel O
is O
full O
of O
trash O
from O
the O
last O
couple O
of O
hours O
when O
there's O
about O
eight O
people O
in O
the O
business. O

They O
can't O
see O
me O
anymore. O

The O
portion O
of O
cake B-TARGET
was O
large O
enough, O
and O
there O
wasn't O
much O
to O
notice. O

Any O
address O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
delicious O
pasta B-TARGET
is O
served O
with O
a O
special O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
thick O
slices O
of O
bread. B-TARGET

And O
the O
coffee B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
and O
there's O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

It's O
nice O
to O
have O
lunch. O

It O
was O
delicious O
at O
caffe O
international. O

So O
after O
we O
checked O
out O
at O
the O
hotel, O
we O
headed O
for O
the O
lovely O
cafe. B-TARGET

Here O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
breakfast O
and O
a O
good O
cup O
of O
coffee. B-TARGET

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
just O
like O
visiting O
a O
friend O
at O
home. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
kind O
and O
correct. O

It's O
an O
absolute O
recommendation O
for O
a O
good O
breakfast, O
a O
good O
breakfast O
and/or O
a O
good O
coffee. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
√† I-TARGET
L'infintise I-TARGET
is O
a O
unique O
experience O
throughout O
Antwerp. O

For O
a O
decent O
price, O
the O
chef O
serves O
us O
his O
culinary B-TARGET
creations I-TARGET
where O
his O
personal O
style O
comes O
into O
play. O

Marc B-TARGET
is O
an O
artist O
who O
knows O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
tastes O
and O
appearances O
of O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

You O
can O
be O
astonished O
by O
one O
thing O
as O
you O
are O
by O
the O
other. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is O
very O
original. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
very O
creative, O
delicious, O
I O
have O
no O
words O
for O
it. O

Friendly O
service. B-TARGET

I'd O
love O
to O
come O
back O
here. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
wait B-TARGET
times I-TARGET
are O
so O
long. O

We've O
already O
booked O
for O
December. O

For O
me, O
the O
chef B-TARGET
deserves O
four O
stars. O

Nicely O
designed, O
lots O
of O
choice, B-TARGET
good O
price-quality O
ratio. O

We O
were O
in O
there O
at O
about O
21 O
o'clock, O
so O
there O
was O
very O
little O
people O
there. O

We O
came O
here O
yesterday O
with O
two O
of O
us O
with O
a O
Groupon, O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
and O
half O
a O
liter O
of O
water. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
was O
more O
friendly O
and O
heartfelt. O

The O
appetizer B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O
The O
headshake B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Different O
super-easy O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
rice O
separately. O

Lots O
of O
vegetables. B-TARGET

Certainly O
enough O
for O
two O
newspapers. O
A O
little O
bit, O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
chicken, B-TARGET
a O
little O
bit O
of O
shrimp. B-TARGET

And O
then O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
sausage B-TARGET
and O
not O
real O
chocolate O
cheese. O

But O
you O
have O
to O
consider O
price/quality. O

Management B-TARGET
super-friendly. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
scared O
when O
I O
read O
the O
other O
reactions, O
I O
can't O
tell O
them O
apart. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
more O
extensive, O
we're O
sure O
to O
come O
back! O

There O
would O
just O
be O
a O
new B-TARGET
owner, I-TARGET
so O
maybe O
that's O
the O
positive O
that O
he O
was O
looking O
for. O

We O
wish O
him O
every O
success. O

It's O
a O
nice O
little O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
they O
serve O
great O
sushi, B-TARGET
but O
there's O
a O
twist O
to O
that O
too. O

There's O
often O
a O
special O
sauce, O
but O
that's O
not O
what O
you O
get O
here. O

You O
get O
two O
hours O
to O
order O
your O
five O
rounds, O
but O
in O
those O
two O
hours, O
you O
only O
get O
three O
rounds O
because O
it's O
so O
damn O
long. O

It's O
about O
30 O
minutes O
from O
your O
order. O

And O
besides, O
there's O
all O
kinds O
of O
ugly O
flies O
flying O
around O
the O
bar, B-TARGET
so O
I O
wouldn't O
be O
sitting O
around O
there. O

The O
lady B-TARGET
was O
kind O
enough, O
and O
we O
even O
got O
to O
change O
tables O
under O
pressure. O

When O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
full, O
there's O
no O
problem O
having O
your O
tummy O
full O
here O
at O
a O
slow O
pace. O

But O
when O
it O
gets O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
pressing, O
the O
people B-TARGET
in O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
operators O
are O
running O
out O
of O
hands. O

Well, O
people B-TARGET
are O
trying O
to O
help O
you O
with O
the O
smile O
where O
they O
can. O

The O
tables B-TARGET
don't O
always O
look O
quite O
as O
clean, O
and O
there's O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
replacement O
here O
and O
there, O
like O
a O
crumbling O
speaker. O

But O
it O
sounds O
worse O
than O
it O
is. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
delicious. O

So O
many O
different O
choices, B-TARGET
and O
the O
flavors B-TARGET
are O
good. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
itself O
may O
seem O
a O
little O
strange O
at O
first, O
and O
many O
people O
think O
they O
won't O
have O
enough. O

But O
rest O
assured, O
your O
stomach O
is O
full O
when O
you O
leave O
the O
case. O

If O
you O
read O
that O
some O
people O
"don't O
dare O
order O
because O
they O
might O
have O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
if O
they O
don't O
get O
it," O
or O
that O
some O
people O
have O
"only O
water," O
then O
those O
"only O
with O
scarcity" O
people O
from O
me O
can O
stay O
away O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
so O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
can O
be O
lured. O

Food O
is O
perfect, O
we O
love O
it O
and O
we've O
enjoyed O
it O
and O
we'll O
come O
back O
any O
day. O

We O
had O
so O
much O
to O
eat, B-TARGET
perfect! O

Shusi's B-TARGET
are O
good, O
even O
if O
you O
have O
to O
decide O
for O
yourself O
whether O
it's O
wasabi O
or O
pepper. O

Hot B-TARGET
meals I-TARGET
made O
from O
magnetron, O
especially O
the O
muscles B-TARGET
and O
the O
ribs B-TARGET
were O
remarkable. O

If O
you're O
a O
frequent O
Shusi O
eater, O
you O
should O
skip O
this. O

I O
regretted O
the O
cost O
of O
having O
gone O
without O
a O
desert O
after O
three O
rounds. O

Driven O
by O
the O
lovely O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
street O
and O
the O
lovely O
cats B-TARGET
in O
the O
window, O
they O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
this O
case. O

I O
didn't O
have O
a O
menu O
card, O
I O
just O
chose O
between O
the O
delicacies O
in O
the O
cold O
air, O
and O
I O
took O
a O
tortellini B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pancetta I-TARGET
served O
by O
the O
dispenser, O
which O
is O
great! O

This O
is O
combined O
with O
nice O
music B-TARGET
in O
the O
background O
and O
a O
delicious O
white B-TARGET
glass O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price. O

Sure O
to O
try! O

The O
flavor O
nation O
is O
really O
something O
else. O

It's O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
for O
lunch, O
but O
also O
to O
get O
something B-TARGET
delicious I-TARGET
to O
eat O
at O
home O
or O
to O
drink O
a O
good O
glass O
of O
wine B-TARGET
with O
a O
selection O
of O
cheese. O

The O
owner O
does O
everything O
only O
because O
he O
has O
his O
hands O
full! O

That's O
why O
the O
prizes O
are O
also O
very O
democratic. O

Everything O
is O
still O
being O
prepared O
in O
an O
artisanal O
way. O

Also O
try O
one O
of O
the O
soft O
pies B-TARGET
or O
quiches, B-TARGET
they're O
for O
fingers O
down. O

In O
short, O
an O
absolute O
recommendation! O

The O
beautiful O
location, O
St. B-TARGET
George's I-TARGET
Gate, I-TARGET
led O
us O
to O
the O
courtyard. O

But O
the O
controls B-TARGET
down O
here O
were O
down. O

It O
was O
as O
if O
we O
were O
stoning O
the O
cook, B-TARGET
even O
though O
no O
one O
was O
around. O

He O
also O
had O
to O
explain O
to O
us O
that O
he O
couldn't O
get O
a O
certain O
dish O
because O
he O
was O
busy. O

We O
were O
being O
watched O
over. O

A O
glance, O
a O
smile, O
a O
"sweet" O
or O
a O
"thank O
you" O
were O
distant. O

Maybe O
underneath O
a O
saturated O
lemonade O
stand. O

And O
then O
there O
was O
the O
accounting, O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
hadn't O
asked O
for O
the O
price O
-- O
five O
euros O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine B-TARGET
we O
could O
still O
get O
-- O
was O
a O
piece O
of O
five-by-five-centimeter O
film, B-TARGET
often O
three-piece O
film. O

This O
amounted O
to O
something O
like O
eight O
euros O
per O
piece. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
flavor O
is O
concerned, O
which O
is O
why O
it's O
so O
tasty, O
my O
soup B-TARGET
was O
as O
flawed O
as O
the O
typical O
bakery O
soup. O

The O
focaccia B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
that's O
for O
a O
fortune. O

Well, O
I'm O
curious O
how O
long O
this O
up-and-coming O
case B-TARGET
will O
last. O

If O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
original O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
this O
is O
the O
right O
place O
to O
be. O

The O
open-air B-TARGET
shop I-TARGET
is O
beautifully O
designed, O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
at O
picking O
and O
choosing O
the O
meal. O

Every O
day, O
there's O
freshly O
prepared O
soups, B-TARGET
light O
meals, B-TARGET
quiches, O
and O
there's O
also O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
pies. B-TARGET

It O
can O
be O
eaten O
locally O
or O
it O
can O
be O
taken O
away. O

I O
chose O
the O
local O
beekeeper's O
honey-coated O
sausage O
soup O
with O
a O
cheese O
spread O
behind O
it. O

The O
soup B-TARGET
was O
really O
great, O
and O
the O
saucers, B-TARGET
which O
had O
been O
selected O
by O
the O
dispenser, O
were O
definitely O
fine. O

And O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
go O
out O
on O
terraces O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
highway, O
at O
the O
pedestrian O
tunnel. O

Good O
food, O
good O
drinks, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
honest O
kitchen, O
dog-headed B-TARGET
-- O
so O
go O
on O
Steve! O

Nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Facilities B-TARGET
are O
modern. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
casual O
in O
style, O
friendly. O

Sometimes O
it O
takes O
a O
while O
to O
get O
your O
attention O
if O
you O
want O
to O
order O
something. O

The O
tables B-TARGET
are, O
as O
in O
so O
many O
places O
in O
Antwerp, O
very O
small. O

But O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great. O

I've O
had O
lots O
of O
cheese B-TARGET
crusts I-TARGET
before. O

L-Dough B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
is O
also O
delicious. O

We O
have O
something O
to O
celebrate, O
and O
we O
decide O
to O
do O
this O
at O
Sombat. O

And O
finally, O
this O
restaurant O
ranks O
number O
one O
on O
TripAdvisor O
for O
Antwerp. O

Expectations O
are O
high, O
and O
that's O
not O
always O
without O
risk. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
where O
you O
can O
just O
walk O
in O
and O
make O
reservations O
in O
advance. O

With O
just O
12 O
covers, O
this O
is O
understandable. O

On O
arrival, O
the O
crowd O
of O
this O
beautiful O
mansion O
has O
no O
doubt O
that O
behind O
it O
lies O
a O
cosy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
are O
treated O
kindly O
and O
with O
that O
typical O
Eastern O
hospitality O
by O
Sombat. B-TARGET

The O
back O
garden B-TARGET
with O
the O
pond O
is O
beautiful, O
but O
unfortunately O
it's O
too O
cold O
outside, O
and O
we O
take O
the O
aperitif O
in O
the O
leather O
lounge. O

This O
is O
a O
delicious O
caviar, B-TARGET
and O
included O
in O
the O
set O
menu O
is O
50 O
bucks O
per O
person. O

Since O
then, O
we've O
been O
sampling O
the O
interior. O

It's O
beautiful, O
it's O
peaceful, O
and O
it O
radiates O
an O
authentic O
Thai O
setting. O

It's O
more O
like O
a O
living O
room O
than O
a O
restaurant. O

The O
whole B-TARGET
thing I-TARGET
feels O
like O
a O
big O
living O
room, O
it's O
a O
cosy O
place O
to O
sit. O

We're O
put O
at O
a O
table O
of O
four O
with O
an O
unusual O
but O
beautiful O
shape. O

Anyone O
can O
talk O
to O
anybody O
without O
any O
problem. O

So O
here O
we O
go. O

The O
two O
cups B-TARGET
before O
are O
fresh O
and O
very O
tasty. O

Mr. O
Sombat O
tells O
us O
that O
tonight's O
menu O
includes O
five O
passages. O

We O
start O
with O
"Chicken O
soup O
with O
cocomut, O
galanka, O
lemongrass, O
time, O
chili O
and O
coriandre." O

This O
is O
a O
fairly O
delicious O
soup, B-TARGET
and O
it's O
a O
delicious O
crust, O
and O
it's O
very O
subtle O
in O
taste. O

Then O
you O
have O
spicy O
seafood O
salad O
with O
vermicelli O
and O
herbes. O

This O
dish B-TARGET
is O
the O
better O
job. O

We O
follow O
with O
chicken O
and O
vegetable O
wraped O
in O
rice O
paper, O
sweet O
and O
sour O
sauce. O

Very, O
very O
prepared. O

The O
lunch O
parade O
ends O
with O
"deep O
fried O
shrimps O
with O
curry O
served O
with O
cucumber O
sauce." O

There's O
nothing O
to O
notice O
here O
either. O

The O
main O
course O
is O
"grilled O
scottish O
beef O
served O
with O
soya O
sauce O
and O
chilli O
powder, O
seafood O
saut√© O
with O
chilli O
and O
basilicum, O
saut√© O
or O
fish O
filet O
with O
coconut O
in O
banana O
leaves O
and O
fresh O
vegetables O
with O
sesame O
oil." O

Here's O
where O
it O
goes O
wrong. O

The O
amount B-TARGET
of O
food O
is O
overcrowded, O
and O
with O
food O
overload, O
I O
always O
have O
a O
problem. O

Also, O
the O
harmony O
in O
structure O
and O
taste O
expression O
between O
the O
many, O
many O
ingredients B-TARGET
is O
completely O
missing. O

Sorry, O
this O
dish B-TARGET
didn't O
work. O

We O
drink O
a O
white O
Pouilly O
Fuiss√© O
and O
a O
red O
Sancerre. O

And O
they're O
both O
excellent, O
and O
they're O
quite O
expensive. O

And O
then O
we O
finish O
up O
with O
an O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
composite I-TARGET
that's O
very O
delicious. O

The O
coffee O
is O
served O
promptly O
from O
the O
house, O
very O
enticing. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
punctual O
and O
polite, O
even O
on O
the O
shy O
side. O

This O
concept O
of O
Home B-TARGET
Cooking I-TARGET
is O
something O
different O
than O
a O
formal O
restaurant. O

The O
ingredients B-TARGET
are O
fresh, O
and O
they're O
all O
tastefully O
cooked. O

But O
the O
harmony B-TARGET
isn't O
always O
right, O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
too O
crowded. O

All O
the O
better O
Thai B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
but O
it's O
just O
not O
refined O
gastronomy. O

But O
what O
won't O
stop O
me O
from O
coming O
up O
with O
another O
one O
if O
I O
get O
a O
chance. O

After O
reading O
the O
many O
positive O
comments, O
I O
made O
a O
very O
careful O
reservation. O

Hospitality B-TARGET
at O
the O
top, O
environment B-TARGET
inside O
and O
outside O
to O
really O
relax O
and O
food B-TARGET
to O
really O
dream O
about. O

Our O
discovery O
of O
the O
year. O

Complete O
in O
all O
respects. O

You O
come O
in, O
you O
feel O
like O
you're O
in O
Thailand. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
stylish O
and O
cosy, O
as O
is O
the O
garden B-TARGET
where O
we O
served O
the O
aperitif. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
not O
too O
spicy. O

The O
host B-TARGET
and O
his O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
kind. O

Sombat B-TARGET
Thai I-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
recommendation, O
and O
we'll O
definitely O
go O
back O
to O
it. O

We O
enjoyed O
an O
excellent O
lunch B-TARGET
with O
a O
delicious O
dessert. B-TARGET

The O
adapted B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
very O
friendly, O
and O
we O
were O
lucky O
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
the O
backyard. B-TARGET

A O
real O
recommendation. O

Don't O
let O
the O
busy O
environment B-TARGET
scare O
you. O

We O
had O
chosen O
a O
four-course O
menu. O

Where O
I'm O
not O
allowed O
to O
eat O
mussels, O
this O
was O
easily O
replaced O
by O
a O
different O
dish. O

I O
finally O
asked O
him O
what O
kind O
of O
wine O
he O
proposed O
for O
the O
maybe O
$50 O
price O
tag. O

This O
was O
one O
of O
the O
cheapest O
things O
on O
the O
map. O

Either O
that O
one, O
or O
the O
other O
one, O
but O
I O
also O
have O
a O
$36 O
Barbera. O

So O
why O
wasn't O
it O
on O
the O
map? O

The O
amuses B-TARGET
and O
also O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
had O
a O
sophisticated O
taste. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
weren't O
very O
large. O

But O
when O
I O
was O
offered O
the O
Irish B-TARGET
beef, I-TARGET
my O
four O
loaves O
were O
full O
of O
holes O
in O
the O
beef O
that O
you O
couldn't O
cut O
with O
a O
knife. O

I O
was O
advertising O
to O
the O
boy. O

And O
a O
few O
minutes O
later, O
the O
chef B-TARGET
came O
in O
with O
four O
decent O
pieces O
of O
meat. B-TARGET

It O
couldn't O
be O
that O
he O
didn't O
see O
it O
with O
the O
dress O
on O
the O
board. O

And O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
exquisitely O
juicy. O

Again, O
an O
enjoyable O
experience. O

Masterpieces O
of O
taste, O
composition, O
combinations O
are O
depicted O
on O
your O
board. O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
enjoy O
it, O
it's O
pretty O
cool. O

Prominence B-TARGET
for O
excellent O
quality O
makes O
your O
menu O
great. O

A O
recommendation O
in O
an O
uncompromising, O
endless O
atmosphere B-TARGET
with O
style. O

The O
address B-TARGET
for O
that O
one O
particular O
occasion, O
to O
be O
enjoyed O
and O
used O
together. O

The O
location B-TARGET
on O
a O
busy O
stone O
road O
is O
a O
disadvantage, O
and O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
not O
a O
recommendation O
either. O

But O
the O
Indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is O
very O
delicious O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
incredibly O
friendly. O

Communication O
with O
the O
customer O
is O
important, O
and O
your O
satisfaction O
is O
really O
their O
concern. O

And O
that's O
why O
I O
always O
like O
to O
-- O

Chewing O
mosquitos, B-TARGET
chewing O
service, B-TARGET
that's O
real O
hospitality B-TARGET
in O
Hasselt. O

It's O
also O
a O
great O
sphere B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

In O
short, O
a O
beautiful O
framework O
for O
the O
San O
Miguel O
gang. O

There's B-TARGET
lots O
of O
baked I-TARGET
goods I-TARGET
and O
pasta. O

Price O
quality, O
very O
good! O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
also O
good O
and O
cheap. O

So O
it's O
also O
very O
convenient O
when O
you're O
shopping O
down O
the O
street. O

But O
bear O
in O
mind, O
it's O
very O
crowded O
around O
noon. O

Here O
you O
have O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
baked B-TARGET
goods I-TARGET
for O
a O
fair O
price. O

The O
pancakes B-TARGET
are O
definitely O
recommended. O

It's O
very O
busy O
here O
a O
lot. O

We'd O
been O
there O
before O
last O
year O
when O
we O
were O
in O
Hasselt. O

Now O
we've O
gone O
back O
to O
it. O

This O
is O
a O
really O
cool O
thing. B-TARGET

Super-friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
delicious O
breads O
and O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
really O
good, O
and O
certainly O
not O
expensive. O

Every O
time O
we O
get O
in O
trouble, O
we're O
sure O
to O
come O
back. O

Nowhere O
in O
Hasselt O
are O
pancakes B-TARGET
as O
delicious O
as O
here!!! O

The O
quick O
operation B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
should O
also O
be O
reported!! O

Just O
smiley O
faces O
at O
six O
sentences: O
-- O
all O
extremely O
delicious O
-- O
not O
too O
much O
trouble O
-- O
n O
at O
the O
end O
of O
which O
is O
still O
a O
reasonable O
expense. B-TARGET

What O
else O
do O
you O
want? O

Very O
good, O
everything O
too O
tiny, O
very O
tasty, O
it's O
a O
recommendation, O
all O
fresh O
ingredients. O

The O
dessert O
was O
very O
good, O
"Lady B-TARGET
White," I-TARGET
mmm. O

Super O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Delicious O
dishes, B-TARGET
very O
good O
wines. B-TARGET

Very O
nice. O

Very O
good O
location B-TARGET
right O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
city. O

Very O
good O
reception B-TARGET
and O
handling. B-TARGET

Best O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
city O
and O
far O
away O

On O
a O
Sunday O
night O
with O
friends, O
fondly O
funded! O

Original O
Swiss O
clothing, B-TARGET
with O
funny O
dolls O
and O
lots O
of O
wood. O

Final O
operation, B-TARGET
delicious O
fondue B-TARGET
(chocolate O
is O
delicious O
light!) O
and O
certainly O
unsolicited. O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
have O
a O
nice, O
easy O
evening. O

Swiss B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
eat O
delicious O
fondue, B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
fondue O
or O
raclette. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
is O
cosy. O

The O
management B-TARGET
was O
good, O
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
okay. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
too O
expensive. O

Few O
foods B-TARGET
compared O
to O
what O
you O
pay. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
came O
out O
of O
the O
fridge, O
and O
they O
didn't O
taste O
good. O

The O
sausage B-TARGET
was O
feathered O
and O
salty. O

23.90 O
euros, O
I O
personally O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
for O
four O
little O
tongue B-TARGET
rolls, I-TARGET
salt O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
puree. O

22.80 O
euros O
for O
a O
fish B-TARGET
broth I-TARGET
with O
two O
dried O
ribs O
of O
cod B-TARGET
and O
two O
dried O
ribs O
of O
salmon, B-TARGET
I O
also O
find O
quite O
expensive O
and O
simple. O

Simple O
modifications O
to O
the O
dishes O
would O
already O
make O
a O
huge O
difference. O

I O
like O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
fresh O
food. O

But O
this O
wasn't O
worth O
his O
money. O

It O
can O
be O
better. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
got O
there, O
the O
owner, B-TARGET
to O
our O
astonishment, O
attacked O
us O
in O
an O
unbelievable O
verbal O
way. O

We O
could O
hardly O
take O
our O
place. O

And O
then O
again, O
he O
talked O
us O
out O
loud O
and O
rude, O
so O
that O
we O
didn't O
even O
take O
the O
menu. O

We O
immediately O
left O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
never O
come O
back. O

Hopefully, O
not O
all O
customers O
are O
treated O
that O
way, O
or O
he O
can O
close O
the O
case O
within O
a O
month. O

Unfortunately, O
we O
can't O
judge O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Just O
back O
from O
a O
totally O
failed O
dinner B-TARGET
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Unfortunately, O
all O
of O
the O
previous O
negative O
comments O
are O
correct. O

A O
group O
of O
eight O
or O
four O
children O
coming O
in O
at O
12:30 O
and O
a O
main O
course, O
followed O
by O
a O
simple, O
light O
shrimp B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
at O
14:45 O
(all O
the O
smaller O
tables O
for O
the O
taken, O
including O
my O
colleagues O
from O
Aalst O
who O
were O
given O
absolute O
priority). O

Kids O
at O
2:30 O
p.m. O

Poor O
quality O
meat. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
actually O
a O
refined O
cafe, O
where O
you O
want O
to O
get O
as O
much O
money O
as O
you O
can O
with O
as O
little O
staff. O

There O
are O
star O
restaurants O
where O
it's O
cheaper O
to O
have O
tables, O
but O
you're O
treated O
with O
respect. O

Here, O
the O
kelner B-TARGET
thinks O
he's O
God O
the O
father. O

Not O
a O
recommendation, O
it's O
much O
cheaper O
to O
find O
it O
in O
Ghent. O

We O
had O
heard O
some O
good O
comments O
about O
this O
restaurant, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
dinner. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
looks O
nice, O
informal, O
with O
the O
wooden O
tables O
and O
chairs, O
the O
(for O
this O
restaurant O
very O
elaborate) O
menu B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
written O
on O
a O
chalkboard, O
and O
the O
many O
(soft) O
bottles O
of O
wine O
that O
are O
displayed. O

There's O
an O
impressive O
collection O
of O
Bourgogne's O
grand B-TARGET
crus I-TARGET
and O
Bordeaux O
wines. B-TARGET

So O
these O
are O
the O
empty O
bottles, O
not O
one O
of O
which O
is O
on O
the O
map. O

Maybe O
the O
chef O
wants O
to O
create O
a O
certain O
ambiance, B-TARGET
even O
though O
I O
can't O
imagine O
what O
this O
is O
supposed O
to O
be. O

For O
an O
aperitif, O
I O
ordered O
a O
g&t. O

Where O
you'd O
normally O
get O
a O
gin O
menu, O
or O
at O
least O
a O
verbal O
summary O
of O
what's O
available, O
the O
operator B-TARGET
would O
have O
to O
choose O
between O
"cruel" O
and O
"not O
cruel." O

When O
I O
asked O
if O
I O
could O
see O
a O
list, O
I O
was O
pretty O
much O
given O
the O
two O
alternatives O
over O
and O
over O
again. O

Now, O
not O
everybody O
has O
the O
language O
skills O
to O
describe O
a O
cessation O
of O
life O
in O
very O
extensive O
terms, O
so O
I O
ended O
up O
with O
something O
that O
I O
had O
chosen O
"nearly O
myself" O
out O
of O
the O
handful O
of O
guns B-TARGET
available O
in O
the O
chosen O
category. O

The O
aperture B-TARGET
was O
very O
well-prepared, O
and O
my O
wife's O
aperture O
wasn't O
too O
bad O
either. O

Amusement O
wasn't O
bad, O
as O
an O
addition O
to O
the O
five-ounce O
raw O
ham, B-TARGET
it O
was O
sour. O

Where O
we O
have O
the O
habit O
for O
our O
youngest O
daughter, O
11 O
years O
old, O
to O
order O
two O
hors O
d'oeuvres O
-- O
hors O
d'oeuvres O
and O
hors O
d'oeuvres O
are O
too O
much, O
so O
it's O
wasteful O
-- O
this O
was O
denied O
here O
without O
a O
bee O
or O
a O
bee. O

Even O
in O
the O
Parisian O
breweries O
that O
we O
regularly O
visit, O
this O
is O
never O
a O
problem, O
just O
to O
draw O
an O
analogy. O

From O
this O
point O
on, O
I O
knew O
that O
the O
night O
was O
not O
going O
to O
be O
what O
we O
imagined O
it O
to O
be. O

Now, O
this O
is O
probably O
a O
form O
of O
"policy," O
but O
it's O
not O
a O
form O
of O
management O
that's O
currently O
in O
place O
in O
most O
restaurants, O
certainly O
not O
in O
a O
facility O
like O
this. O

So, O
it's O
probably O
an O
OK O
restaurant B-TARGET
if O
you O
don't O
go O
with O
kids, O
and O
you O
don't O
really O
like O
the O
way O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
acting. O

Pretty O
cheap, O
which O
brings O
the O
total O
value O
down O
even O
further. O

Garcon B-TARGET
is O
arrogant O
and O
despotic, O
can't O
tolerate O
criticism, O
and O
a O
boss B-TARGET
who O
doesn't O
move O
when O
something O
goes O
wrong. O

Accounting O
for O
large O
portions O
of O
45‚Ç¨ O
Gambas O
while O
we O
had O
ordered O
small O
ones! O

Gamba's B-TARGET
were O
okay, O
but O
cheesecakes B-TARGET
were O
unbearable. O

Garcon, B-TARGET
take O
a O
course O
in O
elementary O
politeness O
and O
customer-friendliness, O
ipv. O
arrogance O
and O
insensitivity, O
but O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
because O
of O
a O
lack O
of O
education! O

For O
us, O
never O
again O
to O
this O
converted O
cafe O
into O
a O
so-called O
over-cost O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I've O
been O
here O
a O
couple O
of O
times, O
and O
I O
get O
the O
same O
impression: O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
it's O
not O
worth O
the O
price. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
wine, B-TARGET
they O
only O
have O
the O
more O
expensive O
bottles. O

And O
if O
you O
buy O
a O
cheaper O
bottle, O
they O
give O
you O
an O
unbelievably O
degrading O
look. O

They're O
certainly O
not O
sympathetic. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
food O
here, O
the O
kitchen's B-TARGET
kind O
of O
slow, O
but O
if O
you're O
not O
fried, O
it's O
kind O
of O
cosy. O

I O
go O
to O
the O
bakery O
every O
time O
I'm O
in O
Ghent. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
delicious O
and O
fresh. O

Their O
bread B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
served O
like O
a O
sandwich. O

The O
daytime B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
it's O
vegetarian, O
it's O
warm, O
and O
it's O
made O
from O
seasonal O
vegetables. O

Their O
spaghetti B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
right, O
crispy O
and O
served O
with O
cheese. O

Terras B-TARGET
is O
quite O
pleasant. O

Management B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
slow, O
but O
it's O
friendly. O

Yay! O

Coffee O
with O
pie. O

You O
can O
have O
seven O
or O
eight O
different O
kinds O
of O
pies B-TARGET
with O
your O
coffee. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

lots O
of O
choice, O
delicious O
and O
well-maintained, O
easy O
to O
find O
parking O
at O
the O
Friday B-TARGET
market. I-TARGET

the O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
there O
are O
no O
wheelchair O
patients O
inside, O
because O
it's O
on O
the O
first O
dive! O

Rugged O
business, B-TARGET
finally, O
with O
decent O
tables O
where O
everything O
fits. O

Teacher O
to O
real O
pottery O
people. O

I O
had O
a O
very O
enjoyable O
and O
very O
tasty O
dinner O
with O
friends O
at O
the O
Fondue B-TARGET
House. I-TARGET

Beautiful O
all-in-one B-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
with O
lots O
of O
choice O
and, O
on O
top O
of O
that, O
unlimited O
choice. O

Fish B-TARGET
and O
meat. B-TARGET

all O
with O
bread O
and O
potatoes O
and O
cheese. O

And O
it's O
a O
great O
homegrown B-TARGET
pig. I-TARGET

Excellent O
price-quality O
ratio. O

Very O
friendly O
operation. B-TARGET

And O
I'll O
come O
back O
to O
that. O

Too O
expensive O
for O
what O
it's O
worth. O

You'd O
rather O
go O
to O
Le O
gout O
avant O
tout O
for O
fondue. O

much O
nicer O
and O
better O
service/price. O

accidentally O
landed O
there, O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
no O
long O
wait O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
crowded O
occupation, O
just O
the O
servicing B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
glazing, O
exquisite O
bottles, B-TARGET
affordable. O

Come O
back O
for O
sure, O
keep O
up! O

A O
plus O
value O
for O
Ghent! O

Ribbons B-TARGET
are O
excellently O
crispy, O
hearty O
sauces. B-TARGET

One O
suggestion: O
Serve O
some O
aubergine O
bread. O
So, O
not O
just O
fries O
or O
patties, O
which O
is, O
of O
course, O
delicious. O

On O
Friday O
nights, O
we O
walk O
in O
at O
3:05 O
p.m. O

None O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
there O
to O
guide O
us O
to O
a O
table O
because O
of O
the O
overwhelming O
staff O
call. O

We O
pick O
a O
place O
for O
ourselves, O
and O
after O
five O
minutes, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
comes O
and O
kindly O
tells O
us O
that O
the O
kitchen O
is O
closed. O

Moreover, O
I O
had O
read O
on O
the O
website O
that O
this O
restaurant O
is O
open O
24 O
hours O
a O
day. O

We O
ate O
really, O
really O
good! O

There O
was O
a O
long O
pause O
between O
Amadeus, O
with O
the O
crowned O
heads, O
and O
this O
one. O

In O
the O
end, O
we O
chose O
this O
case B-TARGET
because O
it O
looked O
cosy O
and O
clean. O

We O
didn't O
regret O
this. O

First O
ordered O
for O
dinner O
with O
a O
drink. O

And O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
too O
long O
for O
this O
to O
happen, O
finally, O
managing B-TARGET
it. O

And O
then O
honeybees, O
and O
these O
have O
not O
waited O
very O
long. O

And O
the O
tasty O
ribs B-TARGET
were O
delicious, O
crocheted, O
and O
they O
didn't O
get O
burned. O

These O
were O
accompanied O
by O
vegetables, O
fries O
and O
soups. O

Everything O
was O
fine, O
and O
this O
was O
for O
a O
good O
price. O

We're O
certainly O
going O
to O
go O
back. O

It's O
not O
Amadeus, O
it's O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
fast, O
and O
the O
ribs B-TARGET
are O
really O
good O
and O
not O
as O
fat O
as O
in O
the O
previous O
case. O

We've O
been O
here O
several O
times O
already, O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
always O
the O
same, O
something O
that O
might O
fail O
somewhere O
else. O

A O
recommendation, O
by O
the O
way, O
for O
the O
chateaubriand B-TARGET
bouqueti√®re: I-TARGET
usually O
delicious O
meat O
and O
excess O
quantity, O
the O
vegetables O
swimming O
in O
the O
jar O
but O
melting O
in O
your O
mouth. O

Occasionally, O
it's O
a O
little O
bit O
less, O
and O
thankfully, O
it's O
usually O
top. O

I'm O
sorry O
that O
the O
wines B-TARGET
have O
been O
stored O
10 O
to O
15 O
percent O
more O
recently O
-- O
a O
2010 O
vintage O
of O
Ch√¢teauneuf B-TARGET
du I-TARGET
pape I-TARGET
is O
now O
90 O
euros. O

It's O
often O
crowded O
and O
rather O
noisy, O
ask O
for O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
michelins O
guide O
(max. O
three O
o'clock) O
or O
in O
the O
back O
room. O

The O
smoker-friendly B-TARGET
bar/lounge I-TARGET
is O
cosy, O
and O
every O
night O
it O
manages O
to O
persuade O
people O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
you. O

It's O
not O
a O
top B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
but O
it's O
a O
recommendation, O
especially O
for O
the O
hungry, O
old-fashioned O
bon-vivant. O

We O
keep O
coming O
back O
regularly O
with O
pleasure. O

My O
partner O
and O
I O
had O
reservations O
for O
Saturday, O
September O
13, O
2014 O
at O
7:30 O
p.m. O

We'd O
been O
here O
several O
times O
already, O
and O
we O
knew O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
steaks B-TARGET
was O
top-of-the-line. O

At O
the O
reservation, O
we O
had O
asked O
to O
be O
on O
the O
porch, O
but O
we O
weren't O
able O
to O
enjoy O
it. O

Fortunately, O
there O
was O
another O
table O
for O
two O
perons O
on O
the O
porch, O
so O
this O
was O
okay. O

So O
very O
quickly, O
we O
got O
a O
hold O
of O
it, O
and O
our O
order O
was O
registered O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
lady. B-TARGET

We O
also O
ordered O
a O
bottle O
of O
white O
homemade O
wine O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
water. O

After O
about O
a O
dozen O
minutes, O
the O
wine O
and O
the O
water O
came O
to O
the O
table. O

And O
not O
long O
afterwards, O
we O
had O
our O
very O
own O
appetizer. O

And O
then O
the O
time O
went O
very O
slowly. O

The O
table O
was O
emptyed, O
and O
waiting O
for O
our O
main O
dish O
-- O
pure O
fish, O
one O
baked O
blue, O
one O
marinated O
-- O
could O
begin. O

I O
thought O
we O
were O
still O
quite O
patient, O
because O
it O
wasn't O
until O
1:30 O
p.m. O
that O
we O
were O
asked O
if O
we O
were O
going O
to O
have O
dinner O
that O
night. O

And O
we O
said, O
"Well, O
if O
I'm O
honest, O
I O
really O
don't O
know." O

Meanwhile, O
our O
bottle O
of O
wine O
was O
empty, O
so O
we O
ordered O
a O
second O
bottle. O

Around O
us, O
we O
heard O
other O
people O
complaining O
too O
-- O
some O
already O
at O
2:30 O
p.m. O

When O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
steak O
at O
2:45 O
p.m., O
after O
2:15 O
p.m., O
our O
steak B-TARGET
was O
actually O
cold. O

But O
our O
friendly O
lady B-TARGET
immediately O
intervened O
and O
took O
the O
steak B-TARGET
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
where O
it O
was O
perfectly O
baked O
and O
served O
warm. O

We'd O
already O
seen O
the O
chef B-TARGET
welcoming O
customers O
all O
night O
long O
and O
giving O
talks, O
so O
we O
really O
wanted O
to O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on. O

We O
asked O
our O
staff O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
chef. O

She O
told O
us O
she O
had O
asked O
him, O
but O
apparently O
he O
didn't O
bother O
coming O
to O
us O
and O
getting O
any O
explanations. O

Apparently, O
you O
have O
to O
be O
at O
least O
BV O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
chef. B-TARGET

So O
the O
bottom O
line O
is, O
quality O
was O
great, O
but O
the B-TARGET
CEO I-TARGET
is O
not O
going O
to O
fail O
to O
talk O
to O
ordinary O
customers, O
he's O
going O
to O
let O
his O
staff O
solve O
the O
problems O
rather O
than O
he's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
figure O
things O
out O
for O
himself. O

Very O
sick. O

Happy-to-be! O

Certainly O
order O
the O
shrimp B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
six I-TARGET
different I-TARGET
sauces! I-TARGET

Unique O
framework. O

The O
most O
read O
Sunday B-TARGET
morning I-TARGET
I've O
ever O
experienced. O

It's O
a O
beautiful O
frame B-TARGET
with O
views O
of O
the O
grass O
leaf. O
(Laughter) O
Coeur O
d'Artichaut O
is O
no O
longer O
based O
in O
the O
Valleys, O
but O
on O
the O
Korenlei. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
young, O
spontaneous, O
friendly, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
first-class. O

It O
all O
starts O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
Prosecco, B-TARGET
and O
then O
the O
actual O
buffet O
starts: O
soup, O
cold O
dishes, O
which O
are O
dishes, O
a O
special O
chef's O
steak O
(this O
time O
it O
was O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
bun O
with O
trumpets O
de O
la O
mort), O
cheese O
sandwiches, O
sweets, O
dessert, O
one O
chocolate O
fountain. O

Meanwhile, O
at O
the O
table, O
white O
wine O
and O
red O
wine O
were O
served, O
and O
of O
course, O
coffee. O

Absolutely O
a O
recommendation. O

Is O
now O
in O
the O
jetty O
at O
Gent O

Less O
good O
hotel O
food O
than O
brunch B-TARGET

My O
wife O
was O
having O
a O
really O
bad O
night's O
sleep, O
and O
I O
felt O
weak O
in O
my O
stomach. O

35 O
euros O
per O
person O
for O
a O
non-food O
meal B-TARGET
-- O
limited O
choice O
for O
brunch. B-TARGET

One O
plus: O
friendly O
operation. B-TARGET

A O
tiny, O
authentic O
Italian B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
right O
next O
to O
the O
old O
market. O

There's O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
pizzas, B-TARGET
both O
vegetarian O
and O
meat O
and O
fish. O

Try O
the O
whiskey B-TARGET
pizza, I-TARGET
which O
is O
a O
great O
recommendation. O

Rare O
restaurants, B-TARGET
places O
on O
small, O
three-story O
buildings O
with O
enough O
space. O

Fast O
operation, B-TARGET
delicious O
pizzas B-TARGET
at O
normal O
prices. O

And O
what's O
remarkable O
is O
the O
number O
of O
different O
kinds O
of O
pizzas, B-TARGET
never O
seen O
anywhere O
else. O

The O
only O
thing O
in O
Leuven O
is O
it's O
really O
real, O
it's O
made-up O
sorbets, B-TARGET
it's O
got O
fruit O
in O
it, O
it's O
got O
no O
flavors, O
it's O
got O
no O
sugar, O
it's O
got O
giant O
bubbles, O
it's O
got O
super-friendly, O
super-enthusiastic O
staff. B-TARGET

There's O
massive O
ice B-TARGET
in O
the O
center O
of O
Leuven. O

ladies' O
square O
offers O
beautiful O
benches O
where O
you O
can O
enjoy O
this O
delicious O
ice. B-TARGET

the O
ice B-TARGET
bubbles I-TARGET
are O
distributed O
yellow! O

The O
servings B-TARGET
for O
a O
brasseries O
are O
pretty O
small. O

It's O
delicious, O
but O
there's O
very O
little O
bread, O
for O
example, O
in O
an O
omelet B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
bacon. I-TARGET

Two O
little O
fried B-TARGET
breads I-TARGET
and O
a O
mini O
dish B-TARGET
are O
actually O
quite O
disappointing. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

Because O
it's O
a O
nice O
cafe, O
I O
expected O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
beers, B-TARGET
but O
this O
wasn't O
the O
case. O

Most O
of O
all, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
haystacks. O

All O
in O
all, O
it's O
fun, O
it's O
cozy, O
but O
not O
top-of-the-line. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
good, O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
not O
very O
friendly. O

If O
you're O
a O
year O
old, O
you O
get O
a O
free O
champagne O
glass, O
but O
that's O
not O
until O
you've O
eaten O
the O
frozen O
one O
in O
advance, O
as O
it's O
called O
with O
an O
aperitif. O

We O
regularly O
eat O
in O
Parma, O
one O
of O
the O
classic O
Leuven O
restaurants. O

The O
kitchen O
is O
rather O
Belgian-French, O
but O
with O
excellent O
ingredients. B-TARGET

It's O
very O
user-friendly O
and O
fast. O

Especially O
fried B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
(cote O
√† O
l'os, O
chateaubriand, O
etc.) O
disregards O
our O
preference. O

the O
inside B-TARGET
isn't O
cool, O
but O
it's O
cool. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
also O
pretty O
classic, O
but O
delicious. O

an O
address O
to O
have O
a O
lunch O
in O
the O
afternoon. O

We've O
been O
out O
to O
dinner O
at O
the O
Timory O
restaurant O
several O
times. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
classically O
located, O
and O
it's O
a O
charming O
place O
to O
be. O

We've O
enjoyed O
the O
monthly O
suggestion, O
"Fish B-TARGET
pure I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
asparagus," I-TARGET
which O
is O
a O
classic O
vegetable-friendly O
dish. O

And O
what's O
more, O
we O
really O
appreciate O
the O
waiting O
service O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
in O
the O
room. O

It's O
a O
little O
address B-TARGET
in O
Leuven O
that O
we're O
going O
to O
go O
to O
again O
blindly. O

I O
haven't O
had O
a O
meal O
yet O
in O
Timor, O
but O
I've O
tried O
the O
ice O
cream O
cups O
a O
few O
times. O

My O
favorite O
is O
the O
Emanuelle O
with O
bananas O
and O
peanut O
butter B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

Also, O
the O
Na-Aper B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vanilla, I-TARGET
chocolate, I-TARGET
banana I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
avocado I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
smooth O
and O
friendly, O
and O
there's O
often O
a O
pleasant O
hustle O
and O
bustle. O

Prices O
are O
good. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
on O
the O
market, O
the O
big O
square, O
and O
we O
didn't O
want O
to O
eat O
here O
because O
we O
thought O
the O
quality O
wouldn't O
be O
very O
good, O
it's O
very O
touristic. O

So O
after O
a O
while O
of O
walking O
around O
the O
streets O
around O
the O
square, O
we O
found O
a O
cosy O
tent, B-TARGET
and O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
inside, O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
backyard. O

The O
prices O
are O
really, O
really O
high, O
for O
four O
thin O
slices O
of O
flammable O
sticky B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
knoflook, I-TARGET
you O
pay O
5.50, O
and O
to O
our O
great O
disappointment, O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
came O
out O
of O
the O
fridge O
at O
+/- O
13.50. O

It O
also O
leaves O
the O
controls B-TARGET
out, O
so O
there's O
no O
grin. O

Give O
your O
money O
somewhere O
else! O

As O
a O
traveler, O
you O
walk O
in O
the O
beautiful O
city O
of O
Bruges, O
and O
at O
some O
point O
you O
feel O
like O
having O
a O
good O
meal. O

You O
walk O
into O
a O
market O
where O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
places O
to O
eat O
with O
attractively O
priced O
menus. O

You're O
going O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
terrace, O
and O
you're O
going O
to O
buy O
something O
out O
of O
the O
menu O
card. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
the O
main O
course O
doesn't O
have O
a O
patty O
or O
a O
vegetable, O
which O
you O
can O
order O
as O
a O
supplement. O

LET'S O
NOTE: O
If O
the O
waiter O
asks O
you O
if O
you O
want O
your O
sandwich B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a O
kruidenbocker, O
this O
costs O
five O
and O
a O
half O
dollars O
for O
a O
bowl O
of O
three O
silly O
little O
pieces O
of O
sandwiches O
per O
person, O
so O
not O
even O
a O
bowl O
for O
more O
people. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
you O
have O
to O
order O
separately O
cost O
a O
dollar O
for O
a O
very O
small O
portion, O
and O
the O
three-dollar O
sausage B-TARGET
is O
way O
too O
watery. O

Cookies B-TARGET
are O
abnormally O
expensive, O
six O
dollars O
for O
a O
cola O
and O
nine O
dollars O
for O
a O
Belgian O
beer. O

And O
then O
when O
you're O
still O
at O
the O
dinner O
table, O
they O
even O
dare O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
leave O
your O
table O
because O
there's O
a O
group O
of O
10 O
people O
who O
need O
your O
table. O

If O
you O
talk O
to O
the O
waiter O
afterwards O
about O
the O
price, O
he's O
familiar O
with O
this, O
but O
it's O
location-specific, O
and O
yet O
he O
has O
no O
explanation O
for O
selling O
sticky B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
for O
five O
and O
a O
half O
dollars. O

Clearly, O
this O
entrepreneur B-TARGET
doesn't O
want O
to O
move O
customers O
to O
come O
back O
the O
next O
day, O
no, O
every O
single O
customer O
who O
turns O
their O
leg O
is O
a O
cashier, O
and O
tomorrow, O
hundreds O
of O
tourists O
walk O
into O
this O
hole. O

If O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
ruin O
your O
stay O
in O
Bruges, O
you O
definitely O
don't O
go O
to O
the O
market O
to O
eat, O
but O
find O
another O
nice-to-eat O
tent O
where O
they're O
familiar O
with O
the O
term O
customer O
engagement O
and O
where O
the O
price-quality O
ratio O
is O
normal. O

OTHER O
SECOND O
WARNING O
Bad O
wine B-TARGET
is O
sold O
as O
house O
wine O
for O
18.50‚Ç¨/1/2 O
liter, O
but O
people O
don't O
dare O
show O
the O
empty O
bottle O
because O
there's O
large-scale O
deception O
with O
brand O
and O
quality O
fries B-TARGET
but O
half-baked, O
cold O
sauce, B-TARGET
and O
on O
every O
dish O
the O
same O
staff B-TARGET
is O
embarrassed O
for O
the O
way O
they O
have O
to O
deceive O
the O
clientele. O

out O
in O
the O
sun O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Egg I-TARGET
Market, I-TARGET
a O
nice O
square O
next O
to O
the O
Market. O

When O
the O
waiter O
handed O
us O
the O
menu O
card, O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
see O
the O
menu O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O
-- O
three O
corridors, O
17.50 O
euros. O

This O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
about O
lunch, O
but O
we O
could O
definitely O
order O
this O
one O
-- O
it O
was O
about O
dinner O
at O
night O
-- O
and O
the O
servings B-TARGET
were O
only O
slightly O
smaller, O
according O
to O
the O
waiter. B-TARGET

So O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
the O
"adult" O
menu O
at O
29,50. O

Or O
did O
we O
have O
it O
sooner? O

No, O
we O
didn't O
have O
that, O
we O
were O
sitting O
in O
a O
nice, O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
people O
watching, O
beautiful O
weather. O

After O
a O
hard O
half O
an O
hour, O
my O
fish B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
came, O
and O
it O
was O
delicious, O
except O
it O
had O
to O
be O
a O
little O
warmer. O

And O
my O
partner's O
escargots B-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

And O
then O
the O
mussels, O
for O
me, O
in O
white O
wine, O
and O
for O
my O
husband O
with O
a O
mustache, O
it O
was O
delicious, O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
mussels B-TARGET
on O
the O
side. O

There's O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
fries. O

A O
couple O
of O
ice O
cubes O
next O
to O
lemon O
ice. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
kind. O

The O
bill O
was O
82.50 O
euros, O
including O
a O
Kirr O
(5.-) O
and O
a O
half-liter O
of O
white O
wine. O

Not O
cheap, O
but O
we O
didn't O
expect O
that O
either, O
and O
I O
thought O
Bruges O
was O
pretty O
cheap O
in O
general, O
not O
just O
Cafe B-TARGET
Belfort. I-TARGET

If O
we O
had O
read O
the O
reviews O
about O
this O
restaurant O
before, O
we O
wouldn't O
have O
been O
eating O
there, O
and O
that O
would O
have O
been O
a O
shame. O

Bar O
and O
bar O
bad O
tent. B-TARGET

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everybody! O

I'm O
sitting O
there O
right O
now, O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
just O
laughed O
at O
us O
because O
we O
had O
ordered O
"just O
two O
cups O
of O
tea." O

No O
fowl O
and O
we'll O
never O
be O
here O
again! O

Self-contained O
eggs! B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
-- O
three O
passages O
-- O
was O
brought O
in O
40 O
minutes, O
and O
the O
appetizer O
was O
still O
edible, O
but O
the O
water B-TARGET
soap I-TARGET
was O
more O
bone O
than O
chicken, O
and O
it O
looked O
terribly O
delicious, O
and O
the O
stew B-TARGET
was O
incredibly O
dry. O

Really O
no O
recommendation. O

Funny O
thing, O
another O
guy O
wrote O
about O
it, O
it's O
kind O
of O
like O
Fawlty O
Towers. O

So O
that's O
how O
we O
thought O
about O
it. O

We O
had O
taken O
a O
seven-dollar O
menu, O
pre-cooked O
it O
and O
tasted O
it. O

But O
then O
we O
got O
steak O
with O
fries. O

That O
looked O
like O
a O
childhood O
portrait, O
five O
loaves O
of O
meat O
and O
a O
few O
pies. O

A B-TARGET
beer O
at O
a O
dinner O
party O
where O
they O
asked O
for O
eight O
euros. O

She O
was O
trying O
to O
get O
her O
hands O
on O
everything O
she O
could O
during O
the O
meal. O

Thank O
you O
for O
not O
doing O
that. O

We'd O
better O
go O
to O
the O
fries. O

What O
a O
rare O
ballet. B-TARGET

Already O
walking O
past O
the O
enjoyable O
Egg O
Market O
sit O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
the O
restaurant O
"t O
Voutje." O

Looked O
nice O
on O
the O
outside. O

We'd O
already O
eaten O
a O
little O
bit O
elsewhere. O

Instead, O
chosen O
for O
a O
limited O
menu O
of O
17 O
euros. O

It O
wasn't O
bad, O
it O
tasted B-TARGET
pretty O
good. O

But O
apparently, O
the O
news O
broke, O
because O
halfway O
through O
our O
dinner, O
at O
9 O
p.m., O
they O
started O
sweeping O
the O
empty O
tables O
and O
moving O
them O
to O
the O
bedside O
table. O

Management B-TARGET
was O
chaotic; O
there O
was O
no O
laughing O
matter. O

In O
short, O
no O
recommendation. O

Next O
time, O
I'd O
really O
prefer O
a O
different O
restaurant, O
because O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
them O
in O
Bruges. O

Question O
of: O
Fold, O
thank O
you!!!!! O

In O
one O
of O
the O
Fawlty B-TARGET
Towers I-TARGET
events, I-TARGET
the O
woman O
Basyl O
in O
our O
company O
was O
stripped O
of O
her O
coat O
from O
the O
woman O
John O
Cleese, O
the O
exile. O

The O
poor O
whale B-TARGET
had O
accidentally O
served O
us O
the O
mosquitoes O
of O
our O
neighbors. O

I O
had O
ordered O
mosquitos O
too, O
so O
I O
was O
happy O
to O
start O
eating. O

All O
of O
a O
sudden, O
the O
mosquito O
shell O
was O
stung O
from O
under O
my O
nose O
by O
the O
woman O
named O
John B-TARGET
Cleese. I-TARGET

My O
comment O
that O
I O
had O
already O
eaten O
from O
the O
mosquitos O
was O
answered O
with O
a O
scathing O
grin O
that O
this O
meal O
would O
be O
thrown O
in O
the O
trashcan. O

and O
a O
few O
seconds O
later, O
she O
came O
to O
our O
neighbors O
with O
a O
stolen O
face O
and O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
money. O

It's O
ironic O
that O
in O
a O
comedy, O
the O
reality O
is O
to O
cry, O
so O
amateurish. O

Staying O
away O
from O
this O
ballet B-TARGET
is O
my O
only O
advice. O

I O
happened O
to O
be O
there O
for O
lunch. O

Personally, B-TARGET
not O
friendly. O

The O
map B-TARGET
says O
no O
non-alcoholic O
drinks. O

If O
you O
ask O
for O
it, O
they O
only O
serve O
water O
at O
half O
a O
barrel O
(you O
don't O
know O
the O
price O
yet). O

We O
took O
chicken O
with O
fries. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
of O
very O
poor O
quality. O

We B-TARGET
had O
no O
wheat O
to O
drink. O

What O
a O
friendly O
user O
interface. B-TARGET

Menu B-TARGET
taken O
with O
various O
little O
appetizers, O
amazingly O
delicious. O

And O
then O
fish B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
really O
good. O

Absolutely O
a O
recommendation. O

Our O
dinner O
at O
The B-TARGET
Olive I-TARGET
Tree I-TARGET
was O
a O
very O
pleasant O
surprise. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
purely O
Greek, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
extremely O
friendly O
and O
attentive. O

We O
can O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
both O
locals O
and O
tourists. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
evening. O

Very O
nice O
storytelling O
of O
the O
pattern B-TARGET
and O
charismatic O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
honest O
wines. B-TARGET

very O
friendly O

I've O
eaten O
some O
delicious O
grilled B-TARGET
squid I-TARGET
because O
it's O
very O
expensive O
and O
it's O
mainly O
tourist-oriented, O
but O
it's O
not O
a O
bad O
experience. O

Both O
the O
map B-TARGET
and O
the O
suggestions B-TARGET
bring O
you O
to O
a O
level O
that O
every O
expert O
dreams O
of. O

The O
better O

whiskeys I-TARGET
are O
not O
unknown O
here, O
and O
the O

are O
for O
both O

to O
eat O
and... O

White B-TARGET

at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
delicious O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
broth I-TARGET

milk. I-TARGET

Nice, O
friendly O
waiter. B-TARGET

Incredible O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
at O
an O
incredible O
price. O

The O
hostess O
is O
a O
great O
cook, B-TARGET
and O
Tom B-TARGET
is O
kind O
and O
friendly. O

One O
of O
the O
better O
addresses B-TARGET
in O
Bruges! O

Certainly O
a O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
chose O
the O
three-course O
day O
menu. O

And O
we've O
also O
had O
so O
many O
excuses B-TARGET
for O
doing O
this O
that O
it's O
been O
as O
easy O
as O
a O
four-way O
street. O

Everything's O
perfect O
for O
taste, O
fun O
and O
surprising O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
dish B-TARGET
was O
kind O
of O
creepy, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
great. O

I O
thought O
the O
architecture B-TARGET
was O
quite O
informal O
for O
the O
setting. O

No O
problem O
for O
me. O

Every O
dish O
was O
explained O
clearly O
what O
it O
was O
and O
where O
it O
came O
from. O

Not O
terrific, O
but O
definitely O
a O
recommendation. O

What O
a O
chef, O
what O
a O
delightful O
snack. B-TARGET

Friendly O
management B-TARGET

Beautiful O
wines. B-TARGET

This O
is O
a O
restaurant O
for O
special O
occasions. O

It's O
used O
from O
the O
very O
first O
bite O
to O
all O
the O
different O
flavors O
of O
the O
coffee. O

Everything O
is O
brought O
very O
originally, O
and O
the O
tastes B-TARGET
are O
great! O

Because O
it O
was O
my O
birthday, O
I O
got O
a O
special O
little O
sign O
with O
a O
happy O
ending B-TARGET
on O
it. O

Nice O
job! O

We O
ate O
delicious O
food O
here! O

lots O
of O
good O
wine B-TARGET
and O
very O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

Nice O
music, B-TARGET
in O
short, O
a O
very O
good O
choice. O

Book O
now, O
because O
it's O
very O
small. O

restaurant B-TARGET
has O
a O
limited O
menu, O
but O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
copied O
and O
delicious. O

the O
host, B-TARGET
who's O
also O
a O
Bruges O
guide, O
makes O
a O
difference. O

What O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
romantic O
dinner B-TARGET
with O
a O
groupon O
became O
a O
complete O
mess. O

We've O
never O
eaten O
so O
bad! O

Wait O
for O
an O
hour O
for O
a O
bruchetta, B-TARGET
which O
was O
a O
dry O
piece O
of O
bread O
with O
some O
baked O
mushrooms O
in O
it. O

The O
main O
course O
was O
pasta O
with O
that O
frozen B-TARGET
seafood I-TARGET
mix, I-TARGET
and O
no, O
come O
on, O
no O
flavor! O

It's O
really O
not O
a O
nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
only O
garnishings O
were O
some O
unwashed O
parsley B-TARGET
that O
kept O
the O
dish B-TARGET
completely O
pressed. O

The O
sand O
is O
still O
cracking O
between O
my O
teeth. O

They O
didn't O
have O
the O
tiramisu, O
so O
they O
ate O
a O
pancake. O

This O
one O
was O
(from O
a O
pot) O
measured O
on O
a O
plate O
of O
frozen O
red B-TARGET
fruits. I-TARGET

Don't O
give O
up O
your O
money O
for O
this! O

Find O
a O
good O
Italian O
to O
eat. O

We O
can't O
do O
worse O
than O
this. O

STILL O
UP! O

The O
frame B-TARGET
is O
very O
typical O
of O
Italy. O

Super O
management B-TARGET
and O
very, O
very O
delicious O
food! B-TARGET

Is O
the O
only O
remaining B-TARGET
Italian I-TARGET
that O
we're O
going O
to O
get O
-- O

a O
restaurant O
run O
by O
an O
Italian O
couple O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Bruges. O

If O
you're O
here O
for O
a O
quick O
snack, O
a O
pizza O
or O
a O
pasta, O
if O
you're O
here O
for O
an O
extensive O
lunch O
or O
dinner, O
there O
are O
better O
addresses. O

Friendly O
host B-TARGET
and O
no O
nonsense O
management. B-TARGET

The O
pizza B-TARGET
and O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
are O
delicious. O

The O
quality O
of O
ice O
cream O
is O
definitely O
fine. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
smells O
of O
cosy. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O
My O
son O
would O
have O
given O
me O
five O
stars O
if O
he O
could O
do O
this. O

Top, O
we're O
definitely O
going O
back! O

We O
ended O
up O
here O
after O
reading O
the O
opinions O
on O
Tripadvisor. O

Unfortunately, O
you O
can O
only O
get O
lunch O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
but O
forests O
try O
this O
restaurant O
out O
on O
their O
own, O
and O
so O
they O
went O
for O
lunch. O

It's O
a O
delicious O
salad B-TARGET
with O
beautiful, O
fresh O
salad O
varieties, O
not O
the O
kind O
you're O
often O
served, O
right O
out O
of O
your O
pocket. O

It's O
finished O
with O
delicious O
dressing, B-TARGET
baked O
bacon O
and O
good O
feta. B-TARGET

For O
starters, O
a O
piece O
of O
baked O
salmon O
with O
crisps O
and O
fresh O
vegetables. B-TARGET

And O
especially O
this O
last O
one, O
we O
can O
appreciate. O

This O
is O
a O
lot O
too O
few O
things, O
and O
you O
really O
appreciate O
your O
dish. O

Everything O
is O
very O
delicious, O
and O
as O
it's O
called O
a O
day O
lunch, O
served O
in O
an O
hour. O

We O
certainly O
shouldn't O
let O
the O
friendly O
user B-TARGET
interface I-TARGET
go O
unnoticed O
either. O

Well, O
something O
to O
go O
back O
to O
and O
try O
out O
one O
of O
their O
menus O
or O
an O
√† O
la O
carte O
menu. O

I O
happened O
to O
stumble O
across O
this O
place O
looking O
for O
a O
restaurant. O

We O
went O
in O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
good O
Tripadvisor O
reviews. O

I O
didn't O
regret O
it, O
the O
three-course B-TARGET
market I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
at O
35 O
dollars O
was O
delicious. O

We O
ate O
delicious O
food O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
35-dollar O
menu B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
flavors O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
came O
right O
up O
to O
them. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
this O
beautiful O
building O
is O
free O
and O
pleasant. O

We O
certainly O
can O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Bruges. O

Very O
smooth O
operation, B-TARGET
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
very O
nice O
ribbons B-TARGET
on O
the O
roof. O

Price/quality O
is O
fine. O

One O
downside: O
hard O
to O
find O
parking O
in O
the O
neighborhood. B-TARGET

Friendly O
reception B-TARGET
and O
very O
fast O
operation B-TARGET
at O
the O
back. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
shoelaces B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
-- O
not O
taken O
the O
ribs O
-- O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
enormous. O

Price/quality O
is O
right. O

In O
short, O
repeatability. O

it O
was O
a O
while O
ago, O
but O
yesterday O
there O
was O
an O
unexpected O
stop, O
and O
of O
course O
we O
can't O
resist O
these O
sweet O
temptations, O
and O
brownie B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
ginger I-TARGET
was O
super-jammie!!! O

a O
very O
delicious O
patisserie! B-TARGET

incredible O
lights. B-TARGET

But O
I O
think O
the O
bread B-TARGET
is O
way O
too O
expensive. O

it's O
nice O
to O
be O
able O
to O
look O
inside O
the O
studio. B-TARGET

breakfasts O
between O
the O
books, O
which O
you O
don't O
get O
very O
often. O

Here O
you're O
sitting O
between O
walls O
full O
of O
books O
in O
a O
cosy O
setting. O

Above O
them O
are O
tables O
so O
you O
can O
read O
a O
book O
comfortably O
while O
enjoying O
your O
drink. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
is O
served O
fresh O
and O
delicious. O

There's O
a O
choice B-TARGET
between O
different O
formulas. O

The O
controls B-TARGET
are O
smooth O
and O
friendly. O

This O
is O
where O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
have O
lunch, O
because O
our O
regular O
lunch O
counter O
was O
closed O
down O
for O
our O
annual O
holidays. O

I've O
read O
many O
positive O
things O
about O
it, O
but O
I'd O
like O
to O
share O
some O
of O
our O
experience O
-- O
just O
so O
the O
developers O
can O
work O
on O
this. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
have O
lunch O
during O
your O
lunch O
break, O
nobody O
expects O
you've O
eaten O
in O
10 O
minutes, O
or O
you'll O
get O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread. O

But O
in O
this O
case, O
they O
were O
spending O
a O
lot O
of O
their O
time. O

There O
were O
a O
couple O
of O
dozen O
tables, O
a O
total O
of O
about O
12 O
people. O

One O
of O
the O
four O
tables O
was O
already O
serving O
lunch O
when O
we O
got O
there, O
so O
that's O
eight O
more O
people O
to O
serve. O

In O
the O
kitchen, O
a O
woman O
was O
cooking, O
a O
man O
was O
serving O
the O
room. O

Although O
we O
got O
our O
drinks O
quickly, O
it O
took O
quite O
a O
while O
for O
the O
guy B-TARGET
to O
pick O
up O
our O
orders O
for O
food. O

Choice B-TARGET
is O
limited, O
banned O
beans, O
special O
crisps O
out O
of O
thick O
slices O
of O
bread, O
cheese/meat O
plate. O
Eventually, O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
both O
got O
a O
crisps. O

Well O
taken O
care O
of, O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
salt O
added. O

and O
cheese O
and O
ham O
and O
breadcrumbs O
with O
wheat O
and O
honey. O

We O
had O
25 O
minutes O
to O
wait O
here. O

I O
really O
don't O
understand O
this. O

Bread, O
bread O
in O
between, O
bread O
in O
the O
pan. O

It O
can't O
last O
that O
long. O

Other O
tables O
were O
operated O
just O
as O
slowly. O

I O
understand O
the O
woman O
in O
the O
kitchen O
has O
only O
two O
hands, O
but O
the O
man B-TARGET
was O
standing O
behind O
the O
bar O
in O
the O
meantime O
-- O
if O
I'm O
not O
mistaken O
-- O
playing O
with O
his O
cell O
phone. O

If O
you've O
got O
lunch O
rush O
hour, O
you O
can O
at O
least O
have O
a O
moment O
of O
applause O
so O
everyone's O
raped. O

And O
even O
after O
the O
meal, O
it O
took O
at O
least O
another O
10 O
minutes O
for O
the O
guy B-TARGET
to O
clear O
out O
our O
boards O
and O
ask O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
anything O
else. O

Our O
lunch O
break O
was O
nearly O
over, O
so O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
bill. O

This O
one O
came O
as O
slow O
as O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
crew, B-TARGET
so O
we're O
going O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
at O
the O
bar. O

Turns O
out, O
they O
found O
this O
kind O
of O
unbearable. O

It's O
incredible O
that O
they O
don't O
understand O
that O
many O
people O
have O
to O
go O
back O
to O
work O
after O
an O
hour's O
lunch O
break O
and O
that O
there's O
no O
play O
on O
this. O

Plus, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
well-kept. O

but O
with O
a O
toast, O
you O
can O
do O
very O
little O
wrong. O

Prices O
are O
really O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
for O
lunch B-TARGET
too. O
If O
I O
pay O
more O
than O
15 O
euros O
for O
lunch, O
most O
of O
the O
time O
I'll O
have O
a O
steak O
with O
fries, O
or O
a O
full-of-a-vent, O
or O
a O
prepared O
plate O
of O
pasta. O

For O
a O
toast O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
cola, O
this O
is O
seriously O
exaggerated. O

Conclusion: O
Go O
here O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time, O
or O
if O
you O
just O
want O
to O
have O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee O
or O
tea O
while O
reading O
a O
book. O

Unlike O
many O
fever O
cases, O
they O
won't O
chase O
you O
here O
because O
you're O
sitting O
too O
long. O

If O
you O
only O
have O
an O
hour O
to O
have O
lunch, O
you'd O
better O
go O
somewhere O
else. O

It O
was O
enjoyable, O
very O
friendly O
people, B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
certainly O
delicious, O
a O
quick, O
delicious O
snack. O

Someone O
who's O
crazy O
about O
self-made B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
is O
in O
the O
right O
place. O

Greetings, O
Sandy O
Beach. O

Super O
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
fresh, O
delicious, O
big O
portion. B-TARGET

Very O
helpful, O
friendly O
and O
courteous. O

Certainly O
I'll O
come O
back O
to O
that. O

A O
must-do O
on O
the O
bridge. O

It's O
a O
very O
enjoyable O
family B-TARGET
affair, I-TARGET
where O
they O
put O
"service B-TARGET
with O
a O
smile" O
high O
on O
the O
agenda. O

You O
really O
put O
the O
extractors B-TARGET
in O
the O
watts. O

You O
can O
go O
there O
for O
an O
extensive O
breakfast, B-TARGET
a O
light O
lunch O
or O
an O
afternoon O
tea. O

Toppers O
are O
the O
fresh O
chocolate B-TARGET
milk, I-TARGET
the O
Victorian B-TARGET
sponge I-TARGET
cake, I-TARGET
the O
cheesecake B-TARGET
and O
the O
scrambled B-TARGET
eggs. I-TARGET

All B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
them I-TARGET
home-made, O
of O
course! O

The O
seasonal O
map, B-TARGET
the O
great O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
make O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
very O
good. O

It's O
a O
great O
recommendation. O

On O
the O
advice O
of O
Carolien O
at O
B&B O
C√¥te O
Canal O
in O
Bruges, O
we O
ended O
up O
here. O

It O
was O
enjoying O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
food. B-TARGET

The O
brothers O
bring O
you O
a O
pure, O
refined, O
high-quality O
kitchen B-TARGET
in O
a O
fairytale O
setting. B-TARGET

We're O
certainly O
going O
to O
come O
back. O

Pomperlut B-TARGET
is O
an O
atmosphere-filled O
restaurant, O
beautifully O
furnished O
and O
cosy. O

Few O
choices, B-TARGET
but O
enough O
choices O
to O
get O
you O
a O
delicious O
meal. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
kind O
of O
cool, O
but O
it's O
correct. O

It's O
a O
great O
recommendation O
for O
the O
winter O
months O
when O
the O
big O
herd O
gives O
you O
a O
nice, O
snuggly O
warmth. O

It's O
an O
atmosphere, O
it's O
a O
cozy O
framework. B-TARGET

Great O
food, O
more O
than O
just O
food. O

Ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
or O
with O
good O
friends. O

We'll O
definitely O
go O
back, O
but O
maybe O
only O
with O
women, O
because O
Peter, B-TARGET
who O
was O
serving O
us, O
was O
an O
eye-opener. O

And O
that's O
great. O

And O
by O
chance, O
we O
ended O
up O
in O
this O
little O
house O
where O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
piece O
of O
Limousin B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
on O
the O
terrace. O

Very O
nice O
management, B-TARGET
adjustable O
wines B-TARGET
and O
that O
in O
a O
nice, O
quiet O
frame, B-TARGET
away O
from O
the O
stress O
of O
the O
Sand O
and O
its O
touristic O
fall. O

It O
was O
a O
relief O
for O
us O
to O
just O
get O
out O
of O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
of O
the O
marketplace O
in O
Bruges O
in O
all O
peace O
and O
quiet O
and O
enjoy O
a O
delicious O
meal B-TARGET
in O
the O
very O
atmosphere. O

All O
the O
menus B-TARGET
tell O
you O
about O
lactose-free O
and O
gluten-free O
recipes. O

The O
combination B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
varieties I-TARGET
was O
extraordinary. O

It's O
delicious. O

It's O
not O
always O
easy O
for O
a O
vegetarian O
to O
find O
a O
restaurant O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
well O
and O
in O
style. O

In O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
we O
can O
do O
it. O

It's O
delicious, O
it's O
honest, O
it's O
separate. O

If O
you O
live O
in O
Bruges, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
recommendation O
and O
one O
I O
would O
recommend O
to O
others. O

It's O
provided O
with O
very O
fresh O
food. B-TARGET

The O
chef B-TARGET
is O
very O
passionate O
about O
what O
he O
does. O

I've O
been O
here O
several O
times, O
and O
it's O
been O
fine. O

You O
get O
more O
than O
you O
deserve O
for O
your O
money! O

I've O
had O
several O
meals O
here O
and O
I've O
had O
very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
very O
delicious O
to O
eat, O
very O
well O
presented, O
lots O
of O
portions B-TARGET
as O
well. O

Very O
reasonably O
priced O
and O
lots O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
you O
wouldn't O
find O
anywhere O
else O
in O
the O
world O
right O
now. O

The O
Lasagne B-TARGET
is O
great. O

Keep O
going! O

My O
girlfriend O
and O
I O
ate O
delicious O
food O
here. O

Not O
the O
usual O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
something O
different. O

Beautiful, O
modern O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
a O
chef B-TARGET
who O
you'll O
notice O
is O
extremely O
passionate O
about O
food. O

The O
fresh O
lemonade B-TARGET
was O
kind O
of O
bitter, O
but O
the O
food O
-- O
in O
our O
case, O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
quiche I-TARGET
-- O
it O
tasted O
incredibly O
good. O

And O
then O
I O
haven't O
talked O
about O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
yet, O
which O
is O
my O
own O
version O
of O
a O
snicker, O
which O
I O
highly O
recommend. O

I O
found O
this O
restaurant O
through O
a O
tripadvisor. O

When O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
and O
saw O
the O
photos, O
I O
definitely O
wanted O
to O
eat O
there. O

When O
you O
walk O
into O
this O
little O
restaurant, B-TARGET
you're O
immersed O
in O
what O
I O
think O
should O
be O
the O
ideal O
world, O
according O
to O
these O
two O
lovely O
young O
people. O

And O
in O
an O
hour, O
you're O
going O
to O
relax, O
you're O
going O
to O
eat O
fantastic O
food, O
and O
you're O
going O
to O
see O
two O
people B-TARGET
who O
are O
100 O
percent O
behind O
this O
concept. O

I O
would O
say O
go O
on O
and O
on, O
and O
I'm O
sure O
you'll O
see O
us O
again. O

We O
ate O
delicious O
food, O
and O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
wine. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
nice, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
cosy O
and O
cozy. O

It's O
been O
a O
really O
great O
night. O
We'll O
be O
back! O

The O
Park B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
is O
certainly O
worthy O
of O
appreciation, O
but O
more O
like O
a O
concept O
overall: O
very O
friendly O
and O
personal O
reception, B-TARGET
beautiful, O
cosy O
and O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
warm O
ambiance, B-TARGET
good O
background O
music. O
(We O
were O
in O
the O
second O
half O
of O
the O
day O
at O
an O
intersection, O
I O
recommend.) O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
at O
the O
level O
of O
"good O
citizen O
cuisine," O
not O
expecting O
top-class O
gastronomy. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
filled O
with O
fresh O
ingredients. O

The O
operator B-TARGET
is O
kind O
and O
attentive O
-- O
lots O
of O
staff O
there O
-- O
but O
lacks O
some O
experience O
and O
fluidity, O
sometimes O
quite O
awkward. O

Maybe O
there's O
one O
point: O
the O
toilets B-TARGET
are O
nice O
and O
clean, O
but O
there's O
only O
one O
toilet O
for O
ladies O
and O
one O
toilet O
for O
men. O

But O
not O
much O
for O
a O
pretty O
big O
restaurant. O

good O
food, B-TARGET
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
really O
attentive, O
and O
they O
know O
what O
they're O
talking O
about, O
like O
the O
wine O
and O
what O
meals O
you're O
getting O
on O
your O
plate. O

Also, O
the O
personal O
attention O
of O
the O
chef B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
that O
you O
all O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
once O
in O
a O
while O
and O
make O
reservations O
online. O

We O
had O
dinner O
at O
Park B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
last O
weekend O
to O
celebrate O
my O
friend's O
birthday, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
very O
successful O
evening. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
perfect O
for O
the O
dishes, O
and O
we O
were O
very O
welcoming. O

In O
short, O
a O
recommendation O
for O
a O
weekend O
in O
Bruges. O

Unlimited O
service, B-TARGET
very O
high O
prices, O
51 O
euros O
for O
three O
coffees, O
three O
apple O
piees O
and O
two O
colas. O

And O
if O
you O
hit O
the O
fire O
hose O
with O
a O
big O
mouth, O
the O
customer O
didn't O
have O
to O
scream, O
they O
had O
to O
give O
a O
foo. O

we O
hope O
that O
something O
can O
be O
done O
about O
this, O
because O
this O
is O
an O
absolute O
depth O
point O
in O
such O
a O
beautiful O
city. O

People B-TARGET
don't O
look O
at O
you, O
throw O
your O
food O
at O
your O
table, O
and O
don't O
even O
bother O
to O
say O
anything O
to O
you. O

If O
you O
ask O
for O
bread, B-TARGET
you O
get O
a O
stack O
of O
hamburgers O
made O
out O
of O
plastic O
bags. O

And O
that's O
at O
the O
price B-TARGET
-- O
four O
euros, O
80 O
for O
a O
stick O
and O
six O
and O
a O
half O
euros O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
white O
truffles. O

Tourist O
accident O
number O
one. O

Walk O
through O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

On O
the O
advice O
of O
a O
hotel O
owner, O
we O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant. O

Great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
attractive O
map. B-TARGET

All O
the O
members O
of O
our O
family O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
great O
evening. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
extremely O
courteous. O

Now, O
one O
of O
the O
things O
that's O
interesting O
to O
me O
is O
the O
use O
of O
herbs, O
where O
the O
soup B-TARGET
that O
I O
liked O
was O
actually O
too O
peppery O
to O
override O
other O
flavors, O
the O
herbs B-TARGET
were O
actually O
quite O
peaceful. O

Given O
the O
price O
level, O
I O
think O
perfection O
is O
the O
norm, O
and O
that O
level O
hasn't O
been O
reached O
this O
evening. O

This O
little O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
a O
side O
street O
in O
Bruges O
is O
a O
real O
recommendation. O

From O
the O
moment O
I O
walked O
in, O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
at O
home, O
everything O
was O
right. O

We O
had O
chosen O
the O
suggestion O
menu O
with O
the O
adapted O
wines. O

Especially O
the O
baby B-TARGET
crocodile I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
water O
cane O
really O
surprised O
me. O

I O
can't O
help O
but O
join O
the O
other O
passionate O
reviewers. O

Tables O
with O
seven O
men O
for O
the O
occasion O
of O
a O
performance. O

Various O
aperitifs, O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
month O
with O
adjusted O
wines, O
dessert, O
coffee O
plus O
soup. O

A O
cheerleader! O

This O
little O
restaurant O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Bruges, O
in O
the O
Amandstraat, O
has O
been O
going O
on O
for O
27 O
years O
with O
the O
same O
chef O
and O
his O
lovely O
wife. O

And O
finally, O
again, O
a O
classic O
kitchen, B-TARGET
fresh O
and O
delicious O
without O
too O
much O
cinema. O

Prices O
were O
excellent, O
we O
had O
four O
of O
them, O
and O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
monthly O
menu. O

We've O
been O
here O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
with O
a O
group O
of O
17 O
people O
and O
we've O
been O
greeted O
with O
great O
hospitality. O

The O
operation B-TARGET
was O
very O
smooth. O

Even O
with O
such O
a O
large O
group, O
everybody O
could O
just O
pick O
and O
choose O
from O
the O
map. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
October, O
we O
could O
still O
have O
an O
aperitif O
outside O
on O
the O
roof O
terrace O
and O
then O
eat O
inside. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Lots O
of O
choice, B-TARGET
and O
everybody O
was O
happy O
about O
their O
haircut. B-TARGET

A O
big O
hug O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
in O
this O
case! O

Once O
upon O
a O
time, O

Or O
was O
there O
a O
time O
-- O

Most O
fairy O
tales O
generally O
start O
like O
this, O
and O
yes, O
"Once O
upon O
a O
time, O
the O
Mermaid O
was O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
be O
with O
a O
friendly O
atmosphere, O
good O
staff O
and O
delicious O
food," O

Unfortunately, O
over O
the O
last O
few O
years, O
we've O
seen O
this O
become O
increasingly O
outdated O
to O
the O
point O
where O
it's O
actually O
below O
all O
expectations: O
customer-unfriendliness, O
bad O
food, B-TARGET
no O
service... B-TARGET

Just O
the O
cashier's O
cheque O
counts, O
and O
you're O
not O
satisfied? O

And O
then O
there's O
the O
door O
-- O

Best O
advice? O

Just O
stay O
out O
of O
here, O
because O
there O
are O
many, O
many O
better O
and O
more O
sympathetic O
restaurants O
in O
Oostende O
that O
at O
least O
know O
what's O
good O
to O
eat O
and O
what's O
really O
good O
to O
serve. O

Yeah. O

We O
came O
several O
times, O
and O
the O
previous O
time O
it O
was O
very O
good. O

This O
time O
I O
took O
the O
fish B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
"small I-TARGET
bouillabaise," I-TARGET
which O
I O
thought O
was O
very O
disproportionate. O
The O
soup O
didn't O
taste O
fish, O
it O
had O
a O
big O
piece O
of O
salmon O
in O
it O
-- O
which O
I O
don't O
like, O
so O
it's O
not O
their O
fault O
-- O
it O
had O
the O
head O
of O
a O
long O
eagle O
in O
it O
-- O
which O
I O
like O
-- O
so O
unfortunately O
only O
the O
head. O

The O
ships O
were O
way O
too O
far O
away, O
and O
there O
were O
crabs O
in O
them. O

So O
the O
question O
was, O
well, O
it O
was O
nice: O
no O
more O
reason, O
so O
you'd O
think O
a O
little O
discount O
or O
a O
coffee, O
but O
none O
of O
that. O

We O
paid O
for O
the O
coffee O
ourselves, O
and O
after O
havingn't O
had O
a O
drink O
in O
six O
years, O
we O
didn't O
even O
have O
a O
good O
day O
outside. O

I'm O
afraid O
of O
fever, O
and O
then O
complain. O

And O
we O
say O
we're O
already O
recommending O
this O
to O
our O
friends. O

Thierry O
Laenens O

Meat O
and O
fish B-TARGET
of O
the O
highest O
quality, O
served O
very O
kindly O
and O
professionally. O

(Not O
by O
accident, O
because O
we've O
been O
there O
many O
times.) O

I O
don't O
notice O
anything O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
just O
too O
expensive. O

The O
Irish B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
does O
come O
to O
the O
boss' O
table, O
you O
pay O
10 O
euros O
for O
it, O
and O
it's O
just O
too O
expensive. O

When O
we O
left O
the O
case, O
we O
were O
almost O
compelled O
to O
write O
a O
good O
review O
here. O

And O
this O
one's O
just O
my O
honest O
opinion. O

Very O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
very O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
dog-friendly! O

We O
even O
brought O
our O
meat O
allowances O
home O
in O
a O
convenient, O
reusable, O
microwave-friendly O
container. O

Keep O
going!!!!! O

P.S. O
spectacular O
if O
you're O
an O
Irish O
coffee O
lover. O

We O
were O
six O
of O
us, O
and O
of O
course O
we O
expected O
more O
from O
this. O

Two O
of O
us O
had O
ordered O
the O
salmon O
from O
to, O
and O
at O
the O
$24 O
price O
for O
the O
fries, O
one O
had O
steak B-TARGET
-- O
not O
more O
than O
125 O
grams O
-- O
23 O
dollars O
for O
the O
fries, O
one O
had O
sat√©, O
19 O
dollars O
for O
the O
fries, O
one O
scampi O
in O
curry O
with O
bread O
-- O
the O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
was O
unobtrusive, O
and O
the O
steak B-TARGET
was O
almost O
inaccessible. O

and O
fortunately, O
they O
serve O
it O
on O
a O
plate O
with O
no O
seasoning, O
and O
it's O
in O
a O
separate O
bowl O
on O
the O
plate, O
otherwise O
we O
wouldn't O
have O
found O
the O
fish O
or O
the O
meat. O

One O
cup O
of O
cheese B-TARGET
for O
five O
grown-ups O
was O
way O
too O
small, O
and O
it O
came O
in O
half O
after O
our O
plates O
had O
been O
empty O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

and O
yet O
they O
were O
timely. O

After O
we'd O
learned O
the O
pattern B-TARGET
of O
our O
disagreement, O
he O
stood O
up O
to O
our O
arrogance O
and O
told O
us O
that O
these O
were O
the O
normal O
portions O
he O
was O
serving O
to O
his O
customers. O

we O
wonder O
if O
the O
children's O
portraits O
are O
the O
same O
size O
as O
ours. O

(Children O
eat O
their O
belly O
full, O
adults O
certainly O
don't.) O

Your O
weakness! O

We're O
going O
to O
eat O
with O
a O
groupon O
in O
this O
case. O

Already O
eaten O
badly, O
tastes O
can O
vary O
nl, O
but O
there O
are O
some O
that O
are O
sick O
that O
are O
really O
not O
normal O
anymore. O

Dishes: O
Light-baked B-TARGET
tuna I-TARGET
was O
baked. O

Scampi B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
look I-TARGET
wasn't O
exaggerated, O
they O
were O
swimming O
in O
the O
boat, O
incredible O
look. O

I'll O
taste O
it O
the O
day O
after, O
and O
it's O
all O
been O
there O
for O
hours. O

Main O
dishes O
Baked O
ribs O
with O
three O
sauces, O
ribs B-TARGET
had O
just O
been O
heated, O
the O
taste O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
strange, O
but O
I O
thought O
of O
a O
strange O
marinade. O

The O
sauces B-TARGET
-- O
home-made? O
-- O
had O
exactly O
different O
colors. O
To O
be O
clear, O
the O
same O
sauce O
had O
different O
colors O
once O
you O
poured O
it O
in. O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
fat O
on O
the O
ribs B-TARGET
as O
well. O

My O
friend's O
steak O
with O
sausages O
was O
ordered O
sickly, O
but O
well O
served, O
and O
after O
explaining O
this, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
said, O
oh, O
I O
said O
bc, O
but O
I O
didn't O
really O
know, O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
sick, O
the O
steak O
was O
not O
black, O

The O
fries B-TARGET
-- O
well, O
in O
order O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
same O
sphere O
as O
other O
comments, O
even O
these O
in O
the O
McDonald's O
are O
better. O

The O
bit B-TARGET
that O
was O
added O
up O
was O
okay. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
still O
the O
best, O
but O
apparently O
we O
were O
lucky. O

The O
same O
tiramisu B-TARGET
from O
the O
neighbors O
was O
harsh O
and O
just O
warm O
on O
the O
bottom, O
sounds O
like O
a O
microwave O
to O
me. O

Mine O
didn't O
have O
this, O
but O
I O
had O
pre-ordered O
the O
dessert O
for O
the O
neighbors O
after O
their O
main O
meal. O

My O
friend O
had O
an O
apple B-TARGET
pie, I-TARGET
which O
she O
thought O
was O
okay. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
-- O
let's O
say O
I've O
had O
a O
better O
one O
for O
much O
less O
than O
22 O
euros. O

Immediately O
after O
the O
dessert, O
we O
left O
without O
saying O
a O
word, O
given O
the O
other O
commentary O
that O
it O
was O
a O
good O
decision. O

After O
10 O
minutes, O
we're O
home, O
and O
my O
friend O
feels O
like O
she's O
coming O
straight O
to O
the O
toilet. O

I'm O
uncomfortable O
with O
myself O
all O
night, O
feeling O
like O
I O
have O
to O
break, O
but O
it's O
not O
coming. O

I O
wake O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
everything O
pops O
out. O

This O
case B-TARGET
should O
be O
closed, O
because O
obviously O
I'm O
not O
the O
only O
one O
who O
has O
had O
a O
bad O
experience O
with O
this. O

Now, O
the O
tide O
doesn't O
always O
have O
a O
good O
reputation, O
but O
things O
like O
this O
certainly O
don't O
do O
it O
well. O

Yesterday, O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
thought O
we'd O
go O
out O
for O
a O
nice O
meal O
in O
the O
good O
weather. O

He O
ordered O
a O
carbonara O
paste, O
I O
ordered O
a O
pancake O
with O
sugar. O

And O
when O
we O
finally O
got O
to O
the O
table O
after O
half O
an O
hour, O
we O
took O
one O
bite O
at O
a O
time O
to O
realize O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
fear. O

The O
carbonara B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
thick O
layer O
of O
cold O
cheese, O
roomy O
and O
cooked O
spaghetti, O
and O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
were O
made O
exactly O
in O
a O
pan O
that O
they O
hadn't O
been O
grazing O
for O
days. O

Terribly O
simple! O

The O
waiter O
went O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
with O
our O
plates, O
but O
we O
just O
got O
them O
back, O
and O
the O
chef B-TARGET
said O
these O
two O
dishes O
are O
normal O
and O
there's O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
them. O

Because O
my O
friend O
had O
barely O
taken O
two O
out O
of O
his O
pasta, O
he O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it, O
and O
then O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
was O
very O
frank O
and O
forced O
us O
to O
pay!!!!! O

We O
never O
come O
back O
here O
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
everybody. O

Even O
if O
it's O
free, O
it's O
not O
worth O
it, O
and O
it O
ruins O
your O
day O
and O
your O
mood. O

If O
I O
could, O
I'd O
put O
a O
sign O
at O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
tell O
all O
the O
visitors O
to O
check O
it O
out. O

Nice O
and O
cozy O
family O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Classy O
meals B-TARGET
and O
positive O
price/quality. O

and O
come O
out O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
fulfillment O
and O
happiness. O

Nice O
people B-TARGET
with O
a O
nice, O
friendly, O
caring O
personality. O

more O
than O
repeatability, O
recommend O
it. O

Nice O
and O
enjoyable O
service, B-TARGET
great O
meals. B-TARGET

I O
think O
it's O
probably O
the O
nicest O
and O
funniest O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Eastern O
Europe. O

I'm O
going O
to O
jump O
in O
here O
regularly, O
and O
not O
just O
for O
the O
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
but O
also O
for O
the O
hospitality. O

First O
of O
all, O
we're O
very O
welcomed O
by O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

And O
then O
the O
food B-TARGET
came, O
and O
that O
was O
perfect! O

The O
best O
salmon B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
of O
all O
time. O

The O
couscous B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
well-prepared. O

We'll O
definitely O
be O
back. O

Everything O
was O
great, O
everything O
was O
fine, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly, O
and O
so O
on O
and O
so O
forth. O
It O
was O
great O
for O
family O
occasions O
too, O
lots O
of O
money O
and O
lots O
of O
food. O

occasionally O
refurbished O
terraces, B-TARGET
but O
because O
it O
was O
fresh, O
we O
just O
went O
in O
to O
eat. O

Very O
outdated O
restaurant, B-TARGET
fabric O
curtains, O
benches O
and O
chairs O
seriously O
damaged, O
mosquitoes O
ordered O
by O
nature. O

I O
got O
three O
hairs. O

It's B-TARGET
rusted O
and O
badly O
damaged. O

It's O
got O
plate O
fries, B-TARGET
it's O
got O
sour, O
it's O
got O
running O
mayo. B-TARGET

My O
friend O
was O
full B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
this I-TARGET
guy, O
but O
he O
looked O
like O
he'd O
already O
eaten, O

They O
can't O
see O
me O
anymore. O
Too O
expensive O
for O
such O
a O
bad O
quality! O

I'm O
not O
often O
critical O
of O
my O
food. O

If O
it's O
good, O
it's O
good. O

But O
this O
was O
all O
well O
and O
good. O

The O
more O
unfriendly O
staff B-TARGET
eating B-TARGET
was O
very O
moderate. O

Price-quality O
ratio O
is O
clearly O
wrong O
here. O

No O
recommendation. O

Without O
your O
money. O

This O
is O
definitely O
not O
a O
recommendation, O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
shallow. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
well, O
this O
is O
definitely O
not O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
you O
should O
go O
to, O
there O
are O
many O
better O
ones O
in O
Eastern, O
unfortunately, O
because O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
on O
the O
market. O

And O
there's O
been O
several O
meals O
now O
that O
we've O
had O
groupon. O

I O
mean, O
you O
can't O
imagine O
a O
top O
restaurant, O
but O
we O
were O
welcoming, O
we O
had O
the O
right O
staff, B-TARGET
we O
had O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

there O
were O
going O
to O
be O
dinners O
on O
Sunday O
night O
November O
2nd O
with O
groupon O
beans, O
had O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
menus, B-TARGET
got O
a O
nice O
table B-TARGET
at O
the O
window O
with O
candlelight, O
good O
and O
fast O
service. B-TARGET

the O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
good, O
there's O
nothing O
to O
notice. O

from O
where O
are O
the O
bad O
reviews O
coming O
from? O

of O
course, O
there's O
a O
big O
terrace O
at O
the O
institution, O
and O
in O
the O
summer O
when O
it's O
nice O
and O
the O
weather's O
fine, O
it's O
sometimes O
overcrowded, O
but O
you O
know, O
when O
you're O
at O
sea O
and O
it's O
nice O
and O
the O
weather's O
fine, O
you're O
asked O
about O
problems, O
and O
they O
usually O
start O
on O
the O
highway, O
there's O
no O
parking, O
etc., O
etc. O

We O
were O
sitting O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
fall O
sun, O
and O
it's O
a O
wonderful O
place. O

Unfortunately, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
over O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
could O
make O
the O
order. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
card I-TARGET
is O
ambiguous O
(French O
and O
Dutch O
together). O

Quite O
a O
delicious O
soup B-TARGET
and O
shrimp B-TARGET
cocktails. I-TARGET

But O
the O
lady B-TARGET
in O
the O
front O
desk O
actually O
threw O
out O
two O
other O
guys O
for O
a O
disagreement O
on O
the O
bonnet. O

A O
short O
while O
later, O
my O
friend O
was O
also O
chased O
away O
because O
she O
was O
taking O
the O
wrong O
door O
to O
the O
bathroom. O

NO O
MORE! O

If O
I O
read O
the O
latest O
reviews, O
after O
my O
visit O
on O
Saturday O
night, O
October O
25th, O
I O
can O
only O
conclude O
that O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
basic O
"class" O
is O
a O
long O
way O
off. O

Indeed, O
waiting O
a O
long O
time, O
not O
drinking B-TARGET
refrigerated, O
uncooked, O
no, O
unrestricted O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
burned, O
and O
then O
when O
you're O
a O
customer O
and O
you O
make O
a O
careful O
remark, O
you O
have O
to O
"stop O
with O
the O
sword," O

It's O
my O
personal O
impression O
that O
this O
is O
a O
case B-TARGET
of O
tourists O
or O
customers O
coming O
here O
once O
and O
never O
coming O
here O
again. O

At O
least O
they O
don't O
see O
me O
here O
anymore! O

Madam, O
sir, O
I've O
always O
been O
very O
polite O
and O
correct, O
and O
I O
promised O
you, O
after O
the O
police O
check-in, O
which O
of O
course O
took O
me O
to O
the O
very O
short O
end, O
that O
I O
was O
not O
going O
to O
leave O
it O
here. O

You O
can O
think O
of O
this O
as O
step O
one. O

This O
is O
a O
promise. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
quick O
bite O
in O
Eastern, O
there O
are O
dozens O
of O
other O
addresses O
than O
McDonald's!!! B-TARGET

Go O
hungry O
for O
the O
cockroaches O
to O
get O
some O
whiskey O
or O
to O
get O
some O
bread O
in O
the O
local O
taverns O
or O
the O
Panos! O

Very O
dirty, O
barely O
square O
tables. O

The O
toilet B-TARGET
visit I-TARGET
-- O
well, O
kids O
can't O
wait O
-- O
it's O
a O
hell! O

Warm, O
dirty O
floors, O
smelly, O
long O
queues... B-TARGET

I O
don't O
speak O
about O
McDonald's O
in O
general, O
but O
I O
think O
it's O
a O
crime O
to O
go O
to O
the O
McDonald's B-TARGET
in O
Eastern! O

It's O
never O
really O
clean, O
and O
the O
floor B-TARGET
is O
always O
very O
sticky. O

You O
also O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
that's O
cold O
to O
eat B-TARGET
or O
that's O
broken O
to O
machines, B-TARGET
etc., O
etc., O
etc. O
flurry. O

But O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
very O
friendly. O

Experimentally O
ordered O
two-times O
coriander O
and O
half O
a O
liter O
of O
homemade O
meat. O

aperitif O
OK O
-- O
about O
seven O
o'clock O
afterwards, O
the O
aperitifs O
-- O
OK O
can O
happen. O

And O
then O
the O
horn B-TARGET
came O
-- O
dried O
out O
so O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
it O
from O
the O
grape. O

This O
really O
wasn't O
edible. O

When O
I O
made O
the O
comment, O
I O
was O
told O
the O
other O
side O
was O
less O
dry. O

And O
then O
immediately O
ask O
for O
the O
bill. O

Another O
positive O
point: O
the O
horn O
wasn't O
drawn O
out O
of O
honest O
shame? O

It's O
a O
memorable O
meal. B-TARGET

By O
the O
time O
you O
walk O
in, O
you're O
already O
surprised O
to O
find O
that O
there's O
tapestry O
all O
over O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

After O
a O
while, O
I O
got O
the O
menu B-TARGET
card, I-TARGET
which O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
billboard, O
literally O
and O
figuratively. O

Prices O
adjusted O
with O
a O
flip O
flop, O
and O
the O
card B-TARGET
stays O
in O
your O
hands. O

To O
put O
it O
mildly, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
map, I-TARGET
a O
horrific O
ringmap O
that O
was O
completely O
ripped O
apart O
and O
stuck O
in O
your O
hands. O

We O
haven't O
really O
looked O
into O
this. O

And O
in O
the O
end, O
it O
was O
chosen O
purely O
for O
the O
filet. O

It O
was O
clearly O
second-rate O
meat, B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
barely O
warm, O
and O
you O
can O
get O
saucers B-TARGET
in O
cans O
of O
the O
fridge. O

The O
guys B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
crew I-TARGET
are O
trying O
their O
best, O
but O
unfortunately O
they O
can't O
help O
but O
suspect O
it. O

If O
you're O
a O
fan O
of O
crawling O
insects O
and O
flying O
insects, O
you'll O
be O
attracted. O

Birds O
come O
for O

up O

Sebastian's O

It O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
wrangle O
between O
a O
restaurant O
a O
little O
bit O
further O
down O
the O
road O
where O
you O
could O
have O
white O
wine O
with O
cream O
and O
mustard O
for O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
than O
20 O
euros, O
or O
La O

where O
they O
offer O
natural O
meat O
for O
13 O

Now, O
seven O

is O
a O
big O
difference, O
so O
let's O
go O
for O

I O
don't O

The O

for O
a O
group O
of O
30 O
people O
in O
time. O

But O
when O
we O
got O
there, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
closed O
on O
holiday. O

Apparently, O
nobody O
thought O
of O
trying O
to O
whiten O
us O
out O
of O
this. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
there O
wasn't O
even O
a O
simple O
"allo O
allo" O
to O
get O
rid O
of. O

Pleasant O
is O
different. O

It's O
very O
limited O
in O
terms O
of O
beer B-TARGET
and O
other O
things. O

The O
prices O
are O
high, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
slow. O

Clearly, O
it O
can O
be O
better. O

do O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
something O
delicious O
and O
cheap? O

lunches O
and O
dinners O
and O
four O
or O
five O
starters O
and O
main O
course? O

then O
you're O
pretty O
much O
with O
Allo O
Allo. O

on O
the O
market O
too O
short, O
with O
a O
nice O
terrace. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
on O
a O
beautiful O
courtyard O
in O
Kortrijk. O

It's O
a O
beautiful O
frame. B-TARGET

We O
took O
the O
36-euro O
menu O
with O
chips, O
tuna O
sashimi, O
herring O
shell O
with O
forest O
mushrooms, O
and O
coffee O
with O
some O
mustard O
seeds. O

All O
very O
correct O
and O
delicious. O

Very O
nice O
for O
this O
prize. O

Good O
management. B-TARGET

The O
quality O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
served O
per O
glass O
could O
be O
better. O

"We're O
having O
dinner O
with O
two O
friends O
at O
night. O

We O
were O
welcomed O
and O
led O
directly O
to O
the O
table. O

Very O
nice O
interior. B-TARGET

On O
the O
chalkboard O
there O
were O
suggestions B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
at O
attractive O
prices. O

We O
chose O
the O
tartan B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
king I-TARGET
cobra, I-TARGET
which O
is O
very O
tasty O
and O
freshly O
prepared. O

The O
fish O
soup O
and O
the O
homemade B-TARGET
Garnall I-TARGET
Croquettes, I-TARGET
these O
are O
really O
authentically O
cooked. O

And O
then O
I'd O
like O
to O
make O
a O
whole O
sausage B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pepper I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
that's O
perfectly O
baked. O

And O
the O
fish-based O
risotto. O

Very O
good O
pickled O
risotto. B-TARGET

And O
to O
close O
the O
evening, O
I'd O
like O
you O
to O
have O
another O
Irish O
coffee. O

Certainly O
a O
recommendation O
for O
interior B-TARGET
design, I-TARGET
management B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

One O
more O
time. O

What O
a O
disappointment. O

It O
all O
looks O
beautiful O
and O
promising, O
but O
food B-TARGET
is O
a O
disaster. O

The O
narrative B-TARGET
is O
far O
from O
heartening, O
trying O
to O
guess O
the O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
month. I-TARGET

The O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
is O
full; O
the O
flower O
salad O
and O
the O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
is O
a O
mess. O

The O
tailor-made B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
are O
bad, O
the O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
is O
not O
cold, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
uncomfortable O
and O
inhumane. O

What O
a O
waste O
of O
money. O

Never O
again. O

Together O
with O
my O
daughter, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
St. B-TARGET
Christopher's I-TARGET
restaurant O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
evening; O
it O
was O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
for O
both O
of O
us. O

The O
processing O
with O
Banyuls O
at O
the O
dinner O
party O
was O
a O
reminder O
of O
many O
holidays, O

The O
long-distance B-TARGET
could O
also O
get O
our O
approval. O

That's O
a O
big O
job O
for O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

And O
the O
mango B-TARGET
tango I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
was O
the O
perfect O
end O
of O
the O
meal. O

Expert O
knowledge O
of O
the O
wines O
was O
very O
kindly O
shared O
with O
us, O
and O
my B-TARGET
wife's I-TARGET
hospitality O
is O
heartbreaking. O

We're O
definitely O
coming O
back! O

Not O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
on O
a O
summer O
Friday O
night. O

It O
was O
dinner O
in O
the O
garden O
of O
this O
beautiful O
mansion. B-TARGET

Even O
though O
it's O
very O
cozy, O
the O
garden B-TARGET
still O
needs O
some O
maintenance. O

Very O
few O
people, O
therefore O
very O
few O
staff. O

We O
had O
to O
be O
able O
to O
have O
three O
tables, O
and O
yet, O
the O
operation B-TARGET
wasn't O
very O
smooth. O

For O
starters, O
the O
half B-TARGET
shrimp, I-TARGET
it O
was O
great. O

Main O
course, O
steak, B-TARGET
very O
much O
the O
same O
thing. O

dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
nutrient. O

And O
finally, O
with O
everything O
on O
it O
and O
everything O
off O
it, O
it's O
pretty O
cheap. O

A O
lady O
and O
a O
gentleman O
were O
in O
charge. O

The O
lady B-TARGET
was O
doing O
fine, O
the O
gentleman B-TARGET
was O
rather O
embarrassed. O

Take O
a O
lunch O
menu, O
it O
was O
a O
Friday O
afternoon. O

Price/quality O
is O
pretty O
good. O

But O
it O
took O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
-- O

From O
12:15 O
a.m. O
to O
15:15 O
p.m., O
so O
three O
hours, O
I O
think O
is O
way O
out O
of O
proportion O
to O
a O
lunch O
menu. O

It's O
good O
that O
we've O
been O
there O
once, O
but O
it's O
still O
there. O

Gastronomically O
delicious O
food O
in O
a O
beautiful O
old O
mansion. B-TARGET

Beautifully O
decorated O
tables. B-TARGET

Management B-TARGET
at O
a O
level. O

Choice B-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
are O
very O
good O
in O
price O
quality. O

A O
real O
recommendation. O

We O
ate O
lunch O
for O
19 O
euros. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

The O
dress B-TARGET
that O
followed O
was O
very O
moderate: O
small O
and O
slightly O
too O
hard O
to O
bake, O
and O
for O
both O
of O
us, O
we O
had O
a O
very O
grueling O
portion O
of O
fries. B-TARGET

Questions O
were O
answered O
after O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
had O
passed O
us O
10 O
times O
without O
looking O
at O
us, O
so O
we O
finally O
got O
them O
when O
the O
rest O
of O
our O
table O
was O
empty. O

For O
dessert, O
we O
had O
Dame B-TARGET
Blanche, I-TARGET
a O
little O
blob O
of O
half-baked O
ice O
cream O
with O
wash O
chocolate O
sauce O
and O
a O
generous O
amount O
of O
cream B-TARGET
from O
the O
dispenser, O
served O
in O
a O
glass. O

A O
dessert B-TARGET
from O
a O
lunch O
doesn't O
have O
to O
be O
big, O
but O
serving O
it O
better O
and O
preferably O
not O
in O
a O
glass O
would O
help O
a O
lot. O

We O
come O
here O
very O
regularly, O
and O
we O
don't O
understand O
all O
the O
negative O
comments. O

But O
yeah, O
that's O
the O
time O
that O
we O
live, O
and O
people O
have O
zero O
patience, O
and O
they're O
quick O
to O
go, O
and O
they O
think O
a O
waiter's O
their O
slave, O
and O
they O
just O
have O
to O
jump O
when O
they O
cut O
their O
fingers. O

Targeted O
people, O
I O
call O
them. O

Would O
you O
like O
to O
see O
them O
do O
it O
for O
themselves? O

In O
New B-TARGET
Havana, I-TARGET
it's O
too O
crowded, O
you O
can O
eat O
too O
much, O
yes, O
prices O
are O
a O
bit O
higher, O
but O
hey, O
that's O
money O
for O
a O
whole O
bunch O
of O
crowded O
places. O

So O
if O
you O
don't O
have O
that, O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
be O
in O
Knokke. O

We're O
always O
served O
delicious O
food, O
and O
we O
enjoy O
a O
drink B-TARGET
or O
a O
good O
meal. B-TARGET

So O
we O
also O
don't O
understand O
the O
nonsense O
in O
P O
magazine. O

Let O
alone O
the O
nonsense O
of O
"Chief O
Bellings" O
ahum. O

Top O
chef O
caught O
doing O
doping. O

What O
a O
reference. O

People O
go O
and O
look O
for O
themselves. O

Now, O
one O
can O
never O
do O
good O
for O
everyone O
once. O

We've O
been O
able O
to O
recommend O
it O
to O
everybody O
since O
then. O

We O
go O
there O
every O
time O
we're O
at O
sea! O

But O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
really O
long O
time O
before O
they O
arrive. O

Pancakes B-TARGET
are O
delicious! O

But O
the O
choke B-TARGET
is O
not O
self-made! O

For O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
there, O
I O
think O
you O
can O
get O
a O
homemade O
one. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
okay! O

Good, O
but O
not O
great! O

It's O
raining O
in O
the O
courtyard! B-TARGET

This O
is O
the O
dirtiest, O
worst O
restaurant B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
been O
to, O
and O
we O
visit O
it O
a O
lot O
a O
year. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
took O
them O
from O
Adam's O
family. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
rotting. O

Close O
that O
trade. B-TARGET

And O
again O
this O
year, O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
fireworks O
festival, O
which O
has O
been O
a O
tradition O
for O
many O
years, O
we're O
going O
to O
have O
dinner O
at O
Wim's. O

We O
knew O
we O
had O
to O
book O
during O
the O
weekends, O
and O
our O
ocean-view O
table O
was O
lined O
up O
waiting O
for O
us. O

Those O
who O
weren't O
supposed O
to O
have O
reservations O
didn't O
come O
in. O

And O
again, O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
delights O
of O
the O
sea. O

this O
is, O
and O
has O
been, O
for O
years, O
one O
of O
the O
better O
addresses O
on O
the O
Knokke-Heist O
sea O
bridge. O

And O
if O
we O
come O
back O
next O
year O
or O
earlier, O
we'd O
love O
to O
come O
back. O

Very O
good O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
sea O
view. O

We O
were O
well O
received O
by O
the O
outsiders, B-TARGET
who O
are O
clearly O
better O
surrounded O
than O
before. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
of O
excellent O
quality. O

We O
took O
the O
grilled O
mutton O
with O
the O
sausages O
and O
the O
roasted O
salmon O
as O
starters. O

And O
then O
came O
the O
royalty O
portion O
of O
cod B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
young I-TARGET
spiders I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mousseline. I-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
can O
be O
done O
a O
little O
bit O
better, O
but O
that's O
a O
detail. O

It's O
a O
big O
family B-TARGET
business I-TARGET
off O
the O
coast. O

Just O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
pleasure. O

In O
the O
meantime, O
we've O
become O
steady O
customers. O

Everything's O
super O
fresh O
and O
subtle. O

Choice O
of O
different O
appetizers, B-TARGET
main I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
desserts I-TARGET
at O
the O
right O
price. O

Attractive O
and O
friendly O
management B-TARGET
in O
a O
nice O
setting. B-TARGET

In O
other O
words, O
a O
real O
recommendation! O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Have O
a O
menu O
with O
wine O
included, O
five O
starters O
and O
five O
main O
dishes. O

It's O
delicious, O
and O
this O
is O
for O
a O
normal O
price. O

two O
lunch B-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
with O
a O
wide O
selection O
of O
starters O
and O
main O
dishes O
at O
the O
right O
price. O

Moreover, O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
staff. B-TARGET

They've O
been O
here O
before, O
and O
they're O
always O
coming O
back O
with O
pleasure. O

to O
make O
reservations O
in O
advance. O

It's O
a O
windy, O
bloody O
September O
day. O

There's O
a O
bunch O
of O
punks O
doing O
the O
tricks. B-TARGET

As O
old-timers, O
our O
hearts O
beat O
when O
we O
see O
how O
much O
money O
is O
left O
on O
the O
streets O
and O
in O
the O
pockets O
of O
customers. O

Outgoing O
customers O
who O
have O
to O
wait O
to O
drop O
their O
order O
is O
rule O
one, O
leaving O
tables O
that O
don't O
get O
tidied O
up O
is O
rule O
two, O
and O
the O
biggest O
sin O
of O
the O
fever O
is O
walking O
around O
with O
empty O
hands O
is O
rule O
three. O

So O
it's O
a O
long O
wait O
before O
you O
can O
order, O
a O
long O
wait O
before O
you're O
served, O
and O
after O
you've O
had O
your O
drink, O
ordering O
a O
meal O
is O
almost O
an O
impossible O
task. O

But O
we O
succeeded! O

We O
had O
moderate O
feeding B-TARGET
on O
Knock's O
prices, O
which O
had O
gone O
up O
even O
further O
because O
of O
the O
casino O
nearby. O

And O
afterwards, O
I'll O
go O
to O
the O
toilet, B-TARGET
which O
is O
no O
recommendation. O

The O
rancid O
sewage O
heat O
hits O
you O
on O
the O
throat, O
and O
you're O
almost O
crushed. O

No, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
going O
to O
have O
a O
long O
life. O

We've O
known O
the O
Lodge O
for O
several O
years, O
and O
we've O
visited O
it O
a O
lot O
(Diest, O
Aarschot, O
Zolder O
and O
Knokke). O

This O
time, O
both O
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
were O
inadequate!!!! O

We O
had O
taken O
shrimp B-TARGET
shells I-TARGET
where O
you O
had O
to O
look O
for O
shrimp. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
that O
was O
served O
there O
wasn't O
even O
fresh O
anymore, O
and O
thrown O
over O
there, O
the O
frozen B-TARGET
parsley I-TARGET
was O
also O
of O
a O
moderate O
quality. O

The O
boat B-TARGET
that O
was O
serving O
our O
seafood O
was O
full O
of O
burnt O
pieces O
:-(. O

We O
sat O
outside O
on O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
which O
was O
fine O
-- O
no O
tablecloths, O
although O
we O
had O
reservations. O

By O
the O
time O
you O
went O
to O
the O
bathroom, O
you'd O
already O
noticed O
the O
smell, O
as O
if O
you O
hadn't O
smelled O
for O
days. O

Also O
in O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
packets O
of O
bread O
and O
butter O
were O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
service O
table. O
(It O
may O
have O
been O
busy, O
but O
picking O
up O
something O
like O
that O
doesn't O
take O
any O
time O
at O
all.) O

There O
were O
three O
room B-TARGET
attendants I-TARGET
there, O
and O
it O
was O
definitely O
not O
very O
crowded, O
and O
they O
had O
time O
to O
talk O
to O
each O
other, O
so O
one O
could O
easily O
clean O
up O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
the O
mess. O

What's O
more, O
one O
of O
the O
people B-TARGET
in O
the O
room O
couldn't O
speak O
a O
word O
of O
Dutch O
or O
French! O

This O
is O
NOT O
the O
service B-TARGET
we O
know O
from O
the O
other O
Lodge O
it O
was O
really O
understated!!!! O

Fireworks O
festival O
-- O
same O
restaurants, O
so O
get O
to O
where O
it's O
happening O
first. O

When O
we O
asked O
if O
there O
was O
a O
place, O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
wanted O
to O
help O
us, O
but O
this O
girl O
was O
dragged O
away O
by O
another O
waiter O
and O
left O
us O
standing. O

And O
then O
we O
sat O
down, O
and O
we O
were O
greeted O
by O
an O
unimpressed O
old O
man B-TARGET
with O
gray O
hair. O

After O
we O
finally O
ordered, O
we O
saw O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
screaming, O
looking O
for O
the O
right O
tables, O
the O
old O
gray O
man O
insulting O
everybody, O

We O
certainly O
saw O
16 O
tables O
walk O
away, O
because O
they O
weren't O
being O
served. O

After O
dinner, O
we O
asked O
the O
old O
man B-TARGET
for O
another O
cup O
of O
coffee, O
and O
his O
answer O
was, O
"Yes!!! O
I'm O
going O
to O
tidy O
up O
all O
the O
tables O
and O
then O
I'll O
come O
back." O

We're O
responding O
to O
this O
and O
saying O
extra O
loudly O
what O
we O
found O
in O
the O
service. O

And O
then O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
back O
and O
said, O
"I O
want O
to O
apologize O
with O
two O
free O
coffees O
(we'd O
ordered O
three), O
but O
if O
you O
don't O
like O
it, O
you've O
got O
to O
dress O
up O
for O
it." O
"SPECIAL O
EXCUUS!!!!" O

And O
at O
that O
moment, O
all O
the O
tables O
around O
us O
that O
weren't O
being O
served O
up O
were O
lifted O
and O
said, O
"He O
just O
has O
to O
find O
another O
job." O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
due O
to O
the O
inconvenience O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
(minutes O
of O
searching O
for O
the O
right O
table), O
the O
sauce O
was O
cold!!!! O

I'll O
never O
come O
back O
here, O
and O
I O
hope O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
-- O
old O
man O
with O
gray O
hair O
-- O
will O
be O
fired. O

because O
the O
way O
he O
was O
reacting O
to O
the O
customers O
was O
outrageous. O

certainly O
for O
that O
price. O

If O
there O
were O
other O
restaurants O
open, O
we O
would O
have O
gone O
right O
away. O

But O
yeah, O
you O
have O
to O
eat. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
list O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Ieper. O

But O
I O
can't O
imagine O
there O
aren't O
any O
better O
restaurants O
in O
Ieper. O

Now, O
don't O
get O
me O
wrong, O
it's O
not O
bad, O
but O
it's O
also O
not O
really O
great. O

There O
are O
five O
ladies B-TARGET
to O
serve, O
but O
when O
we O
walked O
in, O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
ask O
if O
there O
was O
another O
table O
open. O

Later O
that O
night, O
a O
maid B-TARGET
was O
finishing O
up O
her O
shift, O
and O
she O
just O
started O
picking O
up O
the O
food O
residues O
between O
her O
teeth. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
just O
fine, O
but O
not O
much O
more O
than O
that. O

We O
had O
delicious O
meals O
with O
the O
three O
of O
us O
at O
Capella. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly, O
correct, O
helpful O
and O
very O
pleasant. O

We O
all O
had O
a O
three-course B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
which O
was O
really O
delicious. O

I O
ordered O
a O
wine B-TARGET
arrangement I-TARGET
with O
it, O
which O
was O
delicious. O

And O
as O
a O
tip O
for O
dessert, O
you O
could O
also O
give O
them O
a O
dessert O
wine, O
where O
everything O
was O
fine. O

Price/quality O
can't O
get O
any O
better! O

We've O
eaten O
here O
several O
times O
now, O
or O
tried O
at O
least, O
with O
alternating O
success. O

After O
waiting O
several O
times O
for O
our O
meal O
(+45 O
minutes!!!), O
we O
ordered O
the O
last O
time O
empty O
and O
stove O
meat. O

Even O
this O
took O
half O
an O
hour. O

The O
name O
restaurant O
is O
not O
appropriate, O
they O
only O
serve O
vacuum O
meals, O
and O
so O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
inadequate. O

The O
garden O
could O
be O
nice O
if O
the O
grass O
was O
cleared, O
the O
terrace O
even O
more O
nice O
if O
the O
tables O
were O
cleaned, O
and O
it O
would O
make O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
in O
Tennessee O
richer O
if O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
friendly O
and O
the O
wait O
times O
were O
respectable. O

If O
this O
was O
how O
I O
handled O
clients O
in O
my O
work, O
my O
C4 O
would O
be O
there O
pretty O
soon. O

The O
garden B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
but O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
get O
your O
food, B-TARGET
and O
it's O
only O
of O
a O
moderate O
quality. O

If O
you O
just O
want O
to O
have O
a O
drink, O
it's O
a O
great O
recommendation O
because O
the O
garden O
is O
very O
cosy O
and O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
wait O
very O
long O
for O
the O
drink. O

It's O
really O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
garden B-TARGET
outside, O
and O
it's O
really O
nice O
to O
eat. B-TARGET

The O
operation B-TARGET
outside O
is O
pretty O
chaotic O
at O
times. O

Inside, O
it's O
a O
float. O

And O
for O
the O
third O
time O
this O
year, O
we've O
enjoyed O
it O
again: O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
still O
fresh, O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
stylish O
and O
enthusiastic O
all O
the O
time, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
impeccable, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
choice I-TARGET
is O
subtle. O

And O
we O
don't O
want O
to O
let O
that O
go O
-- O
let O
you O
be O
surprised O
by O
the O
paintings O
on O
your O
plate, O
almost O
too O
beautiful O
to O
eat, O
but O
do O
it O
anyway O
-- O
and O
enjoy O
the O
taste B-TARGET
sensations. I-TARGET

Our O
next O
reservation O
is O
already O
there, O

From O
the O
amuse B-TARGET
gueule I-TARGET
to O
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
it's O
just O
incredible O
to O
enjoy O
all O
those O
flavors. O

The O
reception O
and O
the O
handling B-TARGET
are O
friendly O
and O
well-maintained. O

Obviously O
pm080 O
is O
completely O
right, O
and O
yet O
she's O
completely O
forgotten. O

The O
chef, B-TARGET
Stijn, I-TARGET
also O
speaks O
Polish, O
which O
is O
sometimes O
a O
good O
thing O
about O
ps. O

It's O
a O
decent O
kitchen, B-TARGET
and O
it's O
perfectly O
suited O
for O
a O
(rough) O
self-contained O
environment, O
but O
it's O
not O
exactly O
the O
ideal O
setting O
for O
a O
romantic O
head-to-head O
meeting O
with O
your O
loved O
one; O
it's O
a O
bit O
of O
no-nonsense O
and O
it's O
pretty O
fun; O
it's O
also O
a O
spacious O
map B-TARGET
and O
it's O
definitely O
more O
than O
average O
delicious. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
a O
nice O
concept, O
it's O
a O
warm O
setting, B-TARGET
and O
it's O
not O
very O
touristic. O

But O
there's O
more O
customers O
coming O
into O
the O
restaurant O
than O
the O
restaurant O
can O
handle. O

There's O
no O
one O
in O
the O
room O
who's O
going O
to O
take O
the O
lead O
and/or O
keep O
the O
score. O

The O
fixed O
operators O
are O
supplemented O
by O
students B-TARGET
who O
mostly O
walk O
around O
with O
nothing O
or O
one O
thing O
in O
their O
hand. O

friendly O
reception B-TARGET
and O
aperitif O
at O
the O
bar O
(there O
was O
only O
a O
third O
of O
the O
guests O
present O
at O
the O
time) O

ice B-TARGET
cubes I-TARGET
and O
suits B-TARGET
are O
unhygienic O
to O
be O
taken O
with O
your O
bare O
hands. O

at O
the O
table, O
they O
don't O
offer O
a O
beverage O
card O
or O
a O
wine O
card. O

and O
then O
the O
second O
time O
you O
ask, O
the O
original O
wine B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
shows O
up. O

we O
can't O
make O
orders, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
says O
she O
doesn't O
have O
time, O
and O
she O
goes O
right O
back, O
but O
she O
forgets O
about O
this. O

After O
a O
while, O
we O
talk O
to O
another O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
has O
the O
time O
to O
remember O
the O
two O
words O
that O
are O
necessary O
to O
make O
our O
choices O
known. O

The O
snack O
was O
already O
fried, O
and O
the O
dessert O
was O
served O
at O
one O
point O
after O
that O
when O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
bottle O
of O
delicious O
Pouilly B-TARGET
Fuiss√© I-TARGET
to O
the O
table. O

Since O
we O
had O
taken O
the O
aperitif O
at O
the O
bar, O
we've O
been O
standing O
there O
dry O
all O
this O
time. O

the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
didn't O
have O
time O
to O
stand O
by O
and O
eat O
pastries O
at O
the O
table O
where O
a O
family O
member O
of O
hers O
was O
sitting O
as O
a O
customer. O

-- O
the O
slice B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
slightly O
fresh. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

-- O
the O
appetizer, O
the O
extra B-TARGET
soft-cooked I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
was O
standard-of-the-art O
at O
the O
supermarket. O

The O
fat O
near O
the O
butt O
of O
the O
salmon, B-TARGET
which O
gets O
turned O
hard O
when O
you O
smoke, O
wasn't O
cut O
away O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

the O
fondue B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
fries B-TARGET
were O
fresh, O
the O
saucers B-TARGET
were O
industrial. O

and O
then O
they O
ask O
if O
there O
should O
be O
some O
more O
pies, O
and O
then O
they O
quickly O
add O
a O
little O
rule. O

a O
little O
bit O
later, O
we're O
asked O
if O
there's O
any O
meat O
left; O
gracious, O
we O
say; O
half O
full. O

Seventeen O
minutes O
later, O
the O
cleaner O
comes O
to O
tidy O
up. O

"We're O
still O
waiting O
for O
meat," O
we O
said. O

And O
then O
someone O
else O
from O
the O
operator O
sends O
the O
communication O
to O
the O
kitchen O
a O
second O
time. O

A O
kitchen O
counterfeit O
or O
an O
inconsistent O
order O
17 O
minutes O
before O
you O
get O
to O
the O
front O
desk? O

And O
the O
chef O
is O
pointing O
at O
his O
cutter, O
and O
he's O
following O
the O
meat. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
are, O
of O
course, O
cool O
in O
the O
meantime, O
but O
we O
don't O
ask O
for O
the O
warm O
ones O
anymore, O
who O
knows O
when O
we'll O
get O
them. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
overcrowded O
compared O
to O
the O
room. O

The O
room B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
left O
to O
their O
fate: O
pumping O
or O
sucking. O

The O
stress O
of O
the O
people B-TARGET
in O
the O
room O
and O
the O
unnecessary, O
inefficient, O
back O
and O
forth O
walks O
are O
reflected O
in O
the O
customers O
and O
are O
shaping O
the O
atmosphere O
in O
the O
business. B-TARGET

It's O
hard O
to O
enjoy O
here. O

The O
acoustics B-TARGET
are O
a O
hot O
spot. O

From O
a O
small O
client O
base, O
you O
already O
have O
to O
raise O
your O
voice O
in O
order O
to O
have O
a O
clear O
conversation O
with O
your O
partner. O

Acoustic O
cladding, O
3D O
tiles, O
as O
a O
solution? O

If, O
during O
the O
service, O
covers O
are O
washed O
several O
times O
and O
then O
they're O
wrapped O
back O
in O
the O
right O
bags O
and O
then, O
in O
addition, O
all O
the O
waste O
is O
stacked O
up O
unsanitaryly, O
all O
of O
this O
creates O
unnecessary O
noise O
throughout O
the O
entire O
room. O

If O
I O
don't O
have O
an O
email O
address O
on O
the O
website, O
I O
can't O
send O
this O
feedback O
directly O
to O
the O
owner, O
but O
I'm O
going O
to O
post O
it O
here. O

When O
I O
walked O
into O
this O
restaurant, O
I O
was O
being O
talked O
to O
in O
French. O

When O
I O
asked O
them O
if O
they O
spoke O
Dutch, O
the O
answer O
was O
no. O

So O
my O
hunger O
was O
gone, O
and O
I O
went O
to O
the O
rear. O

I O
read O
the O
negative O
reviews O
on O
Tripadvisor O
when O
we O
were O
already O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
the O
Holiday O
restaurant, O
and O
I O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
worried O
about O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
to O
VOO. O

And O
in O
the O
end, O
I O
was O
very O
surprised, O
because O
we O
had O
a O
great O
team O
of O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
fine, O
I O
took O
the O
fish B-TARGET
meal I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
day, I-TARGET
and O
this O
was O
the O
right O
dish O
for O
the O
right O
price. O

No O
culinary O
high-rises, O
but O
for O
that O
you O
have O
other O
facilities O
in O
Newport. O

And O
I O
think O
the O
negative O
criticisms O
are O
very O
exaggerated. O

We O
both O
ate O
pizza B-TARGET
fruits I-TARGET
di I-TARGET
mare, I-TARGET
and O
this O
one O
was O
pretty O
good O
in O
price/quality. O

Quite O
a O
lot O
of O
cheese, B-TARGET
not O
the O
dried-up O
crust B-TARGET
that O
you O
often O
see, O
actually O
quite O
airy. O

However, O
there O
was O
a O
man O
at O
the O
front B-TARGET
desk I-TARGET
who O
couldn't O
speak O
a O
word O
of O
Dutch, O
which O
I O
find O
absolutely O
impossible O
for O
Newport. O

By O
the O
way, O
at O
our O
aperitif, O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
serving O
of O
olives, O
but O
that O
wasn't O
possible. O

For O
as O
many O
Italians O
as O
you O
can O
get, O
this O
is O
the O
standard O
on O
the O
table. O

So O
this O
is O
not O
-- O

But O
what O
we O
got O
was O
delicious. O

The O
Hof B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Heusden I-TARGET
in O
itself O
is O
quite O
a O
special O
place. O

It O
actually O
looks O
more O
like O
a O
caf√© O
when O
you O
walk O
in O
-- O
and O
it O
is, O
because O
you O
can O
just O
get O
a O
drink O
or O
eat O
out O
of O
it. O

But O
in O
the O
back O
is O
the O
restaurant. O

And O
at O
the O
restaurant O
there's O
a O
big O
terrace. O

So O
just O
walk O
through O
the O
cafe O
to O
the O
restaurant. O

And O
that's O
pretty O
neatly O
designed. O

Abdel B-TARGET
is O
top O
chef. O
He O
cooks O
really O
well, O
and O
we O
especially O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
he's O
a O
master O
at O
making O
wild. O

So O
in O
the O
wild O
season, O
everybody O
out O
there! O

In O
summer, O
there's O
a O
big O
terrace O
with O
a O
garden. O

We O
love O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
especially O
because O
of O
Abdel's B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
and O
kindness. O

And O
we O
like O
to O
go O
there, O
especially O
in O
the O
winter O
months. O

Monthly O
menu: O
The O
fine-grained B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
consisted O
of O
a O
three-by-four-inch O
sausage O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
parsley O
on O
it O
and O
something O
similar O
to O
an O
eggshell. O

The O
boat B-TARGET
that O
we O
got O
with O
the O
three O
loaves O
of O
bread, O
for O
two O
people, O
was O
dated O
December O
12th, O
13th O
-- O
almost O
a O
month O
after O
the O
date. O

The O
carpacio B-TARGET
was O
watery O
and O
uninspired. O

The O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

The O
wines B-TARGET
can O
only O
be O
ordered O
in O
a O
glass O
or O
a O
half O
a O
liter, O
except O
for O
homemade O
wine. O

It O
could O
be O
ordered O
in O
bottles. O

So O
I O
assume O
the O
better O
wines O
come O
from O
a O
barrel? O

The O
room O
was O
packed O
with O
people O
who O
came O
to O
eat O
the O
Grouponbon. O

Their O
menu, O
which O
cost O
about O
half O
of O
ours, O
looked O
a O
lot O
better O
anyway. O

The O
thing O
is, O
there's O
a O
lack O
of O
ambiance. B-TARGET
We're O
not O
feeling O
great O
after O
this O
meal O
at O
all. O

There O
are O
many O
restorations O
in O
Destelberg O
and O
Heusden O
that O
have O
a O
much O
better O
price-quality O
ratio. O

There's O
still O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
to O
do. O

We O
had O
chosen O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
Groupon O
voucher. O

But O
we O
were O
disappointed O
when O
we O
arrived. O

It O
was O
exactly O
a O
caf√© O
where O
you're O
going O
to O
have O
a O
drink, O
and O
it O
certainly O
wasn't O
set O
up O
romantically. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
it O
was O
beautifully O
presented O
on O
the O
plate. O

But O
the O
staff B-TARGET
couldn't O
help O
but O
smile. O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
about O
five O
times O
and O
I've O
never O
had O
a O
stutter. O

Otherwise, O
you O
won't O
come O
back. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
always O
welcoming, O
and O
the O
price/quality O
is O
excellent. O

This O
weekend, O
we O
had O
the O
wild O
seasonal B-TARGET
tasting I-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

The O
amusement B-TARGET
is O
already O
surprising O
and O
a O
precursor O
to O
a O
promising O
menu. O

The O
evergreen B-TARGET
Carpaccio, I-TARGET
the O
patriarch O
with O
the O
red B-TARGET
beet I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
forest O
mushrooms, O
are O
each O
one O
of O
these O
surprising O
combinations. O

Add O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
vanilla O
ice O
and O
forest O
berries O
to O
that, O
and O
the O
night O
can't O
go O
away. O

Five O
walks O
for O
45.00 O
euros O
is O
a O
fair O
price O
for O
an O
excellent O
menu. B-TARGET

Reservations O
with O
the O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
were O
always O
successful. O

I O
agree O
that O
a O
smulbox O
for O
the O
little O
ones O
might O
be O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
fast O
food O
snack, O
but O
they O
just O
like O
it. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
top O
one, O
but O
it's O
got O
young O
talent O
and O
it's O
got O
momentum. O

We O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
regularly O
because O
you'll O
find O
the O
best O
pizza B-TARGET
in O
the O
area. O

Mateo's B-TARGET
not O
voted O
for O
the O
best O
pizza O
maker O
in O
Eastern O
Flandre. O

Moreover, O
we O
love O
the O
family O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

There's O
an O
excellent O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
that's O
constantly O
being O
updated. O

Also, O
the O
regular O
menu B-TARGET
is O
constantly O
changing. O

Well, O
we're O
trying O
to O
avoid O
the O
weekend, O
because O
then O
it O
can O
get O
pretty O
crowded. O

So O
everybody's O
trying O
to O
make O
sense O
of O
the O
customers, O
but O
you O
can't O
do O
anything O
more O
than O
humanly O
possible. O

victims O
of O
their O
own O
success, O
one O
might O
say. O

So O
the O
message O
is O
to O
book O
and O
to O
inform. O

It's O
not O
heartwarming, O
it's O
friendly. O

It's O
just O
brute O
mechanics. B-TARGET

It O
was O
as O
if O
everything O
was O
against O
her O
will. O

I O
hope O
this O
was O
a O
moment O
of O
truth. O

In O
any O
case, O
we're O
never O
going O
to O
get O
back O
here. O

The O
food B-TARGET
wasn't O
bad, O
but O
that O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
the O
hostess' B-TARGET
insensitivity. O

Lots O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Destelberg O
that O
don't O
work O
their O
way. O

At O
first, O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
had O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
cluelessness O
about O
getting O
in O
here, O
where O
the O
interior B-TARGET
looked O
a O
little O
bit O
messy. O

But O
we O
overcame O
our O
fear O
and O
we O
got O
the O
surprise O
of O
our O
life! O

We O
were O
greeted O
with O
amazing O
hospitality, O
and O
felt O
at O
home O
in O
this O
friendly, O
family-run O
restaurant B-TARGET
right O
away. O

It's O
not O
all O
that O
silly. O
It's O
rather O
simple. O
You O
want O
to O
be O
in O
an O
Italian O
living O
room, O

And O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
and O
I've O
never O
really O
felt O
Italy O
as O
close O
as O
I O
did O
in O
the O
Etna. B-TARGET

The O
chef B-TARGET
has O
won O
awards O
for O
the O
best O
pizzaiolo O
in O
Flanders O
and O
is O
very O
proud O
of O
this. O

The O
photos O
and O
the O
testimonies O
are O
on O
the O
wall. O

So O
far, O
the O
best O
experience O
I've O
had O
with O
authentic O
Italian O
cuisine O
in O
our O
little O
Belgian O
country. O

And O
the O
price O
is O
also O
very O
reasonable. O

I'll O
be O
back O
here O
in O
a O
minute, O
you O
know! O

I O
ate O
super O
tasty O
pasta B-TARGET
and O
pizza. B-TARGET

The O
chef, O
Mateo, O
is O
an O
Italian. O

It's O
a O
warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
good O
to O
book O
in O
advance. O

price O
is O
average. O

Also O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
party I-TARGET
formula I-TARGET
is O
a O
shot O
in O
the O
arm! O

In O
summer, O
a O
big O
sun B-TARGET
terrace. I-TARGET

I'd O
asked O
a O
steak B-TARGET
sickly I-TARGET
enough, O
but O
this O
one O
was O
medium O
to O
good. O

If O
I O
made O
a O
comment O
about O
this, O
I O
just O
got O
the O
same O
meat O
back O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
I O
was O
wrong. O

For O
the O
rest, O
little O
creative O
kitchen. B-TARGET

No O
recommendation. O

March O
30th, O
beautiful O
day O
again, O
so O
a O
little O
terrace O
on O
the O
way: O
lots O
of O
customers, O
lots O
of O
staff B-TARGET
who O
weren't O
really O
interested O
in O
serving O
the O
people. O

And O
we've O
been O
there O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
who O
are O
sneaking O
by O
without O
taking O
any O
orders. O

In O
the O
end, O
we're O
hungry O
and O
thirsty O
and O
we O
just O
step O
back. O

I've O
had O
such O
an O
unfettered, O
uninterrupted O
operation B-TARGET
with O
nerds. O

It's O
just O
incomprehensible. O

We O
don't O
see O
them O
there O
anymore. O

"The O
youngest O
harvester" O
has O
primarily O
planted O
the O
beautiful O
garden B-TARGET
where O
it's O
well-loved O
for O
families O
with O
children O
and O
larger O
groups, O
didn't O
it O
mean O
that O
the O
current O
management O
has O
changed O
the O
concept O
dramatically? O

On O
Sunday O
afternoons, O
there's O
animation O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
dinner O
show, O
an O
arrangement O
that O
costs O
70 O
bucks, O
but O
then O
you O
get O
entertainment O
from O
pop O
stars O
like O
Frank O
Galan, O
Danny O
Fabri, O
Paul O
Severs O
and O
everyone O
quanti. O

It's O
only O
suitable O
for O
a O
limited O
niche O
audience. O

We O
thought O
we'd O
sit O
down O
and O
eat O
something O
in O
the O
garden B-TARGET
-- O
you O
don't O
pay O
70 O
euros, O
you O
can O
just O
order O
from O
the O
snacks O
-- O
but O
there, O
too, O
the O
decibels O
of O
royalty O
are O
sent O
to O
you O
-- O
poor O
neighbors. O

We O
ate O
fast O
and O
tasted O
sweet O
and O
made O
it O
go O
away. O

If O
you O
like O
flamenco O
and O
other O
beaters, O
go O
ahead, O
don't O
pay O
70 O
bucks O
and O
put O
yourself O
in O
the O
garden; O
if O
you O
don't O
like O
it, O
just O
stay O
away. O

the O
new O
building O
looks O
like O
a O
public O
swimming O
pool O
or O
a O
gymnasium. O

How O
do O
you O
get O
in O
your O
head O
to O
renew O
a O
matter O
with O
tradition O
and O
nostalgia O
in O
such O
a O
horrible O
way? O

cozyness O
is O
miles O
away. O

You O
can O
have O
a O
meal O
and O
a O
drink O
here, O
the O
prices O
are O
slightly O
higher O
than O
they O
normally O
would O
be, O
but O
you O
still O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for. O

There's O
also O
a O
playground O
for O
the O
kids, O
and O
in O
the O
summer O
it's O
definitely O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
time. O

No O
problem O
having O
another O
meal O
in O
this O
restaurant/caf√© O
around O
9:30. O

Management B-TARGET
was O
fast O
and O
it O
happened O
quickly. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
seats O
in O
this O
facility, O
and O
yet, O
even O
on O
a O
weekday, O
they O
manage O
to O
get O
almost O
all O
the O
seats O
occupied. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Great O
organization, B-TARGET
lots O
of O
variation, O
for O
anybody O
who O
wants O
to. O

Friendly O
management, B-TARGET
cozy O
interior, B-TARGET
all O
in O
a O
beautiful O
green O
location. B-TARGET

We'd O
love O
to O
come O
back O
again! O

Very O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
fantastic O
environment B-TARGET
in O
the O
forest, O
ideal O
for O
a O
bicycle O
stop O
where O
you O
can O
enjoy O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
also O
the O
effort O
to O
just O
go O
and O
have O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
cozy O
terrace O
next O
to O
the O
amphibians. O

Very O
nice, O
friendly O
reception, B-TARGET
super O
good O
management, B-TARGET
helpful O
and O
perfect O
explanation O
of O
the O
dishes! O

Price O
quality O
is O
a O
perfect O
recommendation. O

Beautiful O
choices, B-TARGET
very O
balanced, O
very O
well-trained O
and O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

delicious O
meals B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
wines, B-TARGET
very O
affordable. O

We've O
eaten O
there O
several O
times O
already. O

Again O
and O
again, O
rejected. O

Very O
kind O
lady. B-TARGET

It's O
delicious. O

It's O
a O
real O
taste O
festival. O

So O
far, O
we O
haven't O
found O
any O
other O
restaurant O
that O
can O
tap O
into O
this. O

Unfriendly O
people B-TARGET
-- O
knee-jerk O
-- O
worst O
food B-TARGET
ever O
-- O
don't O
go O
there!!!! O

And O
then O
the O
people O
in O
the O
fever O
complain, O

in O
the O
frame O
of O
a O
candy O
bar O
we O
served O
at O
"de O
mein," O
the O
asparagus B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
not O
bread, O
served O
with O
butter. O

and O
the O
roast B-TARGET
beetle I-TARGET
broke O
through O
and O
tasted O
-- O
all O
five O
blocks O
on O
the O
beetle's O
tail O
-- O
and O
ate O
like O
a O
cheese O
sandwich. O

the O
fish B-TARGET
ate O
nicely, O
but O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
asked O
for O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
boiled O
cheese, O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
said, O
"The O
cheese's O
gone. O

And O
on O
the O
third B-TARGET
step, I-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
cr√®me O
br√ªl√©e O
in O
the O
offer, O
even O
though O
this O
had O
been O
discarded O
in O
the O
voucher. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
decaffeinated O
coffee. O

you O
guess O
the O
answer O
is, O
"Isn't O
there?" O

the O
night O
after O
that O
was O
a O
night O
of O
hell. O

my O
wife O
gave O
up O
all O
night O
and O
died. O

So O
the O
final O
conclusion: O
still O
too O
much O
money O
paid, O
stuck O
in O
at O
18 O
o'clock O
and O
left O
at O
21.15 O
o'clock. O

Also, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
kind O
and O
helpful. O

after O
an O
unsolicited O
reservation, O
they O
never O
wanted O
to O
serve O
us, O
and O
this O
is O
after O
one O
and O
a O
half O
hours O
of O
waiting. O

Successful O
and O
successful O
in O
the O
future. O

It's O
pretty O
awful O
what O
they're O
serving. O

Never O
eaten O
so O
badly. O

steppegrass B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
soap I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
that's O
kind O
of O
shattered O
that O
illusion O
for O
a O
moment. O

It O
doesn't O
even O
count O
cheese. O

Just O
stop O
with O
this. O

In O
my O
experience, O
it O
was O
reserved O
outside O
for O
lunch, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
inside O
a O
separate O
room. O

It O
was O
extremely O
holy O
and O
noisy. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
but O
I'd O
rather O
have O
a O
more O
enjoyable O
atmosphere B-TARGET
on O
a O
nice O
spring O
day. O

We O
pre-arranged O
a O
menu O
for O
a O
group O
of O
10 O
people. O

Correct O
price O
for O
a O
three-course B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
-- O
fish O
or O
meat, O
each O
-- O
including O
drinks O
and O
aperitifs. O

Certainly O
good O
quality, O
to O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
the O
participants. O

Thank O
you! O

And O
we'd O
been O
advised O
by O
our O
acquaintances O
to O
come O
and O
sit O
down O
here O
as O
well. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
here O
for O
Valentine's O
Day. O

There O
was O
just O
this O
table O
of O
two O
left, O
and O
they O
ordered O
the O
Valentine's O
Day O
menu. O

And O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
really, O
really O
good, O
and O
we O
knew O
right O
away O
that O
we O
really O
needed O
to O
get O
here O
more. O

It's O
a O
real O
recommendation O
for O
having O
a O
good O
meal. O

And O
also, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal, O
there O
was O
a O
nice O
little O
present O
for O
Valentine's O
Day. O

Reserve O
a O
hopeless O
cause. O

Two O
reservations, O
two O
not O
on O
the O
list!!! O

Confirmation O
email O
from O
Social O
Deal O
shows, O
come O
on, O
give O
it O
up, O
and O
you're O
done! O

welcome! O

forget O
it. O

Waited O
half O
an O
hour O
for O
the O
first O
tapas. O

and O
it O
worked O
pretty O
well, O
but O
there's O
not O
a O
lot O
that O
can O
be O
said O
about O
serving O
crackers B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
raisins. I-TARGET

Wait O
another O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
for O
another O
tiny O
little O
portion. B-TARGET

tapas O
eat O
as O
much O
as O
you O
want? O

they O
decide O
how O
much O
you O
eat, O
if O
you're O
lucky O
you O
get O
four O
times O
three, O
if O
they O
don't O
make O
sense, O
you O
should O
do O
it O
with O
less. O

Servicemen B-TARGET
tried O
their O
best, O
but O
the O
baseman B-TARGET
can O
pretty O
much O
follow O
a O
course O
of O
rehearsal, O
bah O
bah. O

Can't O
"so-called" O
be O
good O
in O
Dutch. O
What O
a O
joke, O
he O
was O
complaining O
about O
the O
famous O
Social O
Dealers O
and O
the O
arrival O
of O
guests O
who O
brought O
this O
formula O
with O
them, O
in O
perfect O
Dutch. O

Within O
a O
year O
now, O
I'm O
curious O
to O
see O
what O
next O
year O
looks O
like. O

Don't O
think O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
go O
for O
a O
second O
time, O
which, O
after O
all, O
is O
the O
point. O

Possible, O
unfortunately, O
because O
it's O
not O
up O
to O
the O
chef. B-TARGET

We O
had O
family O
dinner O
at O
7: O
00 O
p.m., O
and O
at O
7: O
30 O
p.m., O
we O
got O
the O
drinking O
pass, O
and O
at O
7: O
40 O
p.m., O
we O
had O
to O
pass O
the O
order O
for O
the O
meal. O

None O
of O
the O
tapas O
that O
we O
ordered O
came O
to O
the O
table O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
and O
there O
were O
also O
some O
tapas O
that O
we O
passed O
on. O

Management B-TARGET
was O
very O
bad, O
and O
there O
was O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
clarity. O

Everything O
was O
too O
much O
for O
them. O

We O
could O
have O
unlimited O
tapas O
for O
two O
hours, O
but O
at O
20.55, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
said O
the O
kitchen O
was O
closed O
at O
21.00. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
so O
bad, O
we'd O
better O
go O
to O
the O
fries. O

So O
no O
recommendation!!!! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
the O
kiss B-TARGET
was O
horrible, O
there O
was O
no O
explanation, O
and O
with O
pain O
and O
difficulty, O
they O
could O
order O
it O
twice, O
and O
the O
waiter's B-TARGET
lady I-TARGET
was O
looking O
at O
her O
watch O
with O
reluctance, O
and O
if O
you O
were O
whispering O
or O
shouting O
or O
trying O
to O
get O
her O
attention O
in O
some O
way, O
she O
just O
seemed O
to O
ignore O
it. O

I'm O
sorry O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
to O
eat. O

Trying O
for O
months O
to O
book O
with O
the O
social O
deal O
voucher, O
couldn't O
make O
it O
through O
the O
social O
deal O
website, O
then O
tried O
on O
the O
phone, O
got O
very O
irritated O
that O
I O
had O
to O
book O
with O
a O
computer, O
tried O
again, O
couldn't O
make O
it, O
then O
complained O
in O
writing O
to O
the O
social O
deal O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
booking. O
What O
we O
saw O
there O
was O
very O
dirty, O
bad O
taste, B-TARGET
terrible O
management, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
on O
the O
map O
were O
suddenly O
served O
with O
other O
vegetables, O
and O
yet, O
staff B-TARGET
are O
sitting O
or O
standing O
there O
enough, O
but O
they're O
not O
coming O
from O
their O
place. O

Oh, O
my O
God! O

On O
Sundays, O
four O
adults O
get O
breakfast O
for O
the O
third O
time O
in O
a O
row. O

It's O
a O
great O
recommendation. O

We O
had O
the O
luxury B-TARGET
breakfast, I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
indeed O
luxury. O

Very O
delicious O
sandwiches B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
cups, I-TARGET
sufficient O
bread, B-TARGET
very O
delicious O
ham B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
delicious O
coffee, B-TARGET
tea B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
milk, O
definitely O
recommended. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
your O
breakfast O
is O
in O
a O
beautiful O
frame. B-TARGET

We'll O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
this O
case B-TARGET
in O
Damme. O

It's O
one O
of O
the O
few O
things O
where O
the O
customer O
is O
really O
king. O

We O
had O
a O
little O
house O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
that O
didn't O
have O
breakfast. O

by O
choosing O
the O
reviews O
here O
on O
the O
site O
for O
this O
case O
to O
go O
to O
breakfast. O

And O
what O
a O
treat. O

And O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
open O
the O
door, O
they O
jump O
in O
for O
delicious O
cookies. B-TARGET

We O
chose O
a O
deluxe B-TARGET
breakfast I-TARGET
for O
10 O
bucks, O
and O
what O
a O
party O
that O
was. O

Two O
sandwiches O
to O
choose O
from. O

Hard, O
soft, O
meerkats, O
you O
name O
it. O

And O
then O
there's O
a O
choice B-TARGET
of O
coffee O
cakes O
-- O
really O
coffee O
cakes, O
but O
also O
croissants, O
with O
or O
without O
chocolate O
-- O
or O
other O
delicious O
breads. B-TARGET

And O
then O
a O
glass O
of B-TARGET
orange I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
-- O
not O
bitter, O
but O
very O
good O
-- O
as O
much O
coffee O
as O
you O
want. O

A O
freshly-cooked O
egg, B-TARGET
standard O
perfectly O
softly-cooked, O
if O
requested O
a O
little O
harder. O

The O
evidence O
is O
made O
up O
of O
slices O
of O
ham O
and O
cheese. O

Jam O
and O
nutella O
and O
spicy. O

All O
in O
all, O
quite O
a O
lot. O

More O
than O
enough. O

It O
was O
so O
good O
that O
on O
day O
two O
we O
just O
got O
back O
here. O

Super-friendly O
woman B-TARGET
behind O
the O
counter O
that O
we've O
been O
having O
conversations O
with, O
open O
and O
honest. O

For O
the O
complete O
picture, O

A O
real O
recommendation. O

Nice O
business B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

It's O
fast-paced. O

The O
scammers B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
doable. I-TARGET
They're O
super. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
are O
even O
better O
than O
in O
most O
restaurants. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
definitely O
not O
a O
recommendation O
for O
having O
a O
nice O
dinner. O

When O
we O
walked O
in, O
we O
didn't O
feel O
good, O
and O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
actually O
inappropriate O
to O
leave O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
so O
we O
didn't O
order O
the O
appetizer. O

We O
were O
the O
only O
guests O
at O
that O
time. O

The O
control B-TARGET
was O
moderate, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
was O
sitting O
behind O
his O
PC O
all O
the O
time O
after O
the O
main O
course. O

The O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

After O
we'd O
chosen O
a O
proper B-TARGET
course, I-TARGET
which O
didn't O
work, O
we O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
pay O
the O
bill O
in O
cash. O

One O
day, O
we'll O
never O
be O
together O
again. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
owner B-TARGET
arrogant, O
he's O
actually O
insulting O
his O
customers. O

Both O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
hotel O
are O
to O
be O
dismissed O
as O
the O
pest. O

In O
the O
rooms, O
there's O
fish O
noise O
and O
kitchen O
noise. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
moderate O
and O
certainly O
not O
worth O
the O
price. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
here O
with O
another O
couple, O
and O
immediately O
chose O
the O
real O
Belgian O
for O
the O
menu. O

Tomato O
Shrimps-Slices-Dam O
Blanche: O
It O
didn't O
look O
bad. O

And O
it O
certainly O
wasn't O
bad O
to O
choose O
a O
cafeteria O
somewhere O
in O
the O
center O
of O
a O
city. O

But O
if O
your O
boss O
consciously O
chooses O
a O
restaurant, O
the O
whole B-TARGET
thing O
could O
be O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
refined O
and O
the O
tour B-TARGET
a O
little O
bit O
more O
cosy. O

A O
recurrence O
of O
earlier O
mistakes O
in O
Eastern O
Kentucky? O

The O
shrimp B-TARGET
were O
delicious, O
the O
tongue B-TARGET
was O
finely O
baked, O
but O
for O
that O
price, O
the O
presentation B-TARGET
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better. O

Now, O
everything O
seemed O
to O
be O
plotted, O
and O
maybe O
it O
was, O
too, O
and O
the O
chef, B-TARGET
we O
would O
see O
him O
regularly O
sitting O
behind O
his O
computer O
at O
a O
table O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
to O
the O
great O
delights O
of O
our O
partners, O
looking O
at O
it O
all O
the O
time. O

The O
waiter's B-TARGET
unpleasantness, O
both O
when O
she O
walked O
in O
and O
during O
the O
whole O
meal, O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
terrifying, O
and O
also O
the O
clicking O
of O
her O
shoes O
caused O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
from O
the O
clients O
in O
the O
room, O
so O
they O
couldn't O
really O
enjoy O
the O
food O
any O
more. O

When O
we O
calculated, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
we O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
pay O
cash, O
because O
their O
device O
was O
so-called O
piecemeal. O

So O
again O
and O
again, O
going O
to O
the O
ATM O
to O
end O
this O
less O
enjoyable O
evening. O

This O
is O
where O
we O
don't O
take O
our O
friends O
anymore. O

Yesterday, O
enjoying O
ALL O
in O
the B-TARGET
South. I-TARGET

the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
TOP, O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
SCHITTEREND, O
the O
adapted B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
are O
SUPER, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
VERY O
WARM O
and O
cozy, O
and O
the O
hostess, B-TARGET
incredibly O
CHARMANT, O
it O
was O
enjoying O
in O
the O
greatest O
sense O
of O
the O
word! O

The O
kid O
couldn't O
have O
made O
a O
better O
choice. O

We O
chose O
the O
menu O
and O
the O
adapted O
wines. O

Four O
corridors, B-TARGET
sufficiently O
large O
portions, O
and O
a O
streak O
for O
the O
palate. O

The O
selected O
wine B-TARGET
was O
SU-PER! O

The O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
staff B-TARGET
and O
also O
the O
explanation O
of O
the O
dishes O
made O
this O
evening O
unforgettable. O

We're O
definitely O
coming O
back! O

very O
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
perfect O
service B-TARGET
and O
an O
unconstrained O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
hostess B-TARGET
gives O
you O
a O
warm O
welcome: O
we'll O
definitely O
come O
back! O

It O
was O
delicious. O

I O
gave O
up O
fishing O
because O
I O
didn't O
eat O
fish. O

I O
got O
two O
beautifully O
adapted O
dishes. O

Well, O
a O
supplement O
was O
suggested O
for O
this, O
which O
was O
not O
discussed. O

That O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
downside. O

Sphere, B-TARGET
wine, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
top! O

We O
had O
a O
three-course O
menu. O

Everything O
was O
fine O
and O
well O
taken O
care O
of. O

Nice O
presentation. B-TARGET

Nice O
and O
nice O
interior. B-TARGET

The O
ownership B-TARGET
makes O
for O
a O
great O
reception O
and O
is O
very O
attentive. O

And O
we O
went O
out O
for O
a O
day O
at O
sea O
in O
this O
little O
restaurant. O

And O
it's O
a O
plus O
for O
the O
location, B-TARGET
because O
you're O
just O
outside O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
of O
the O
coast O
in O
the O
lovely O
center O
of O
De O
Haan. O

Parking O
is O
not O
a O
problem. O

We O
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
very O
quickly O
received O
by O
the O
owner, B-TARGET
who O
could O
immediately O
give O
us O
tips O
about O
the O
best O
places O
on O
the O
ground O
floor. O

The O
monthly B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
very O
nice. O

My O
tomato-based, B-TARGET
mozzarella-based, I-TARGET
basilicum-based I-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
was O
surprising, O
fresh O
and O
timely. O

It's O
a O
real O
taste O
bomb! O

The O
carpaccio B-TARGET
on O
the O
other O
side O
is O
fresh O
and O
crisp, O
but O
to O
my O
husband's O
taste, O
it's O
got O
way O
too O
much O
olive O
oil. O

And O
the O
bread B-TARGET
that O
came O
in O
was O
delicious. O

The O
main B-TARGET
course, I-TARGET
again, O
was O
very O
good O
and O
delicious. O

The O
cod B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
pasta O
and O
the O
black O
truffle O
is O
delicious! O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
kind O
of O
a O
fruit O
and O
vegetable-based O
soup O
and O
not O
our O
thing. O

But O
generally O
speaking, O
wonderfully O
wrapped O
in O
a O
very O
friendly O
and O
warm O
frame. B-TARGET

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
beautiful O
facility B-TARGET
and O
the O
casual, O
friendly O
welcome. B-TARGET

What O
we O
got O
on O
board O
was O
a O
very O
high O
level. O

It's O
not O
what O
you'd O
expect O
in O
a O
small O
cotton O
village. O

And O
you O
can O
see O
here O
very O
clearly O
that O
there O
are O
super-highly O
educated O
and O
yet O
incredibly O
sympathetic O
people B-TARGET
at O
work. O

We're O
certainly O
coming O
back O
here O
because O
we're O
curious O
about O
other O
dishes O
that O
bring O
them O
to O
the O
table. O

A O
recommendation! O

The O
chef B-TARGET
shows O
you O
the O
flavors O
on O
your O
plate, O
while O
Tine B-TARGET
serves O
you O
with O
a O
smile. O

It's O
a O
great O
experience. O
The O
choice O
between O
two O
menus O
is O
so O
difficult O
because O
everything O
is O
delicious. O

Almost O
the O
third O
time O
we've O
eaten O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

Every O
time O
top O
of O
a O
to O
z. O

The O
operation B-TARGET
is O
very O
smooth O
and O
pleasant. O

Tinne B-TARGET
always O
knows O
how O
to O
surprise. O

All O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
delicious O
at O
a O
very O
high O
level. O

Very O
beautiful O
creations O
by O
the O
chef B-TARGET
who's O
working O
with O
organic O
produce. B-TARGET

Just O
the O
most O
delicious O
restaurant. B-TARGET

is O
worth O
at O
least O
one O
star. O

Delicious O
food, B-TARGET
beautiful O
surroundings, B-TARGET
great O
service, B-TARGET
but O
one O
downside. O

It O
says O
lunch B-TARGET
is O
always O
37 O
euros, O
and O
they O
raised O
42 O
euros O
because O
it O
was O
a O
Sunday, O
July O
21. O

I O
didn't O
think O
that O
was O
fair. O

If O
you O
look O
outside O
again, O
it's O
actually O
always O
37 O
euros. O

where O
to O
start? O

no O
idea, O
maybe O
staff? O

untouched O
(but O
don't O
know O
the O
etiquette O
for O
a O
brasseries/caf√©/tavern. O

drinks B-TARGET
are O
served O
in O
half O
to O
almost O
dirty O
glasses O
-- O
lipstick O
and O
the O
like O
from O
previous O
guests O
-- O
food B-TARGET
is O
just O
to O
remain O
silent. O

it O
all B-TARGET
tastes O
like O
it's O
just O
a O
side O
dish O
and O
the O
finished O
dishes O
are O
heated O
up O
in O
a O
microwave. O

sauces, B-TARGET
think O
that O
the O
pots O
are O
still O
half O
open O
and O
dated. O

then O
it O
tastes O
like O
my O
own, O
totally O
fried O
Mayonnaise, O
which O
is O
even O
better O
to O
chew O
on. O

will O
remain O
silent O
about O
the O
whole O
thing B-TARGET
in O
general. O

as O
far O
as O
I'm O
concerned, O
rather O
than O
going O
to O
the O
pig O
farm, O
where O
it's O
cleaner O
and O
much O
better O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
and O
service. O

We O
were O
aggressively O
taken O
out O
of O
our O
80 O
dollars O
and O
eaten. O

After O
asking O
three O
times O
for O
a O
sauce O
and O
getting O
it O
always O
fried O
with O
this O
horrible O
sauce, B-TARGET
I O
went O
to O
the O
baker's O
story. O
(Laughter) O
Just O
stirred O
up O
the O
fries, O
chicken. O

He O
was O
getting O
meaner O
and O
meaner, O
and O
when O
I O
told O
him O
that O
the O
customer O
was O
still O
the O
king, O
he O
just O
got O
meaner O
and O
meaner. O

I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
wasn't O
averse O
to O
paying O
for O
such O
a O
service. B-TARGET

I O
went O
back O
to O
my O
wife, O
and O
I O
sat O
with O
the O
kids. O

And O
yet, O
as O
we O
were O
eating O
our O
hungry O
children, O
suddenly O
the O
waiter O
was O
standing O
next O
to O
us. O

BETALEN! O

NOW!!! O

We O
put O
him O
on O
a O
monthly O
treadmill O
to O
calm O
him O
down, O
which O
he O
failed O
to O
do O
several O
times. O

He O
took O
the O
food O
under O
our O
noses, O
threw O
it O
at O
us O
with O
a O
patio O
chair, O
and O
became O
angry O
and O
angry. O

At O
that O
moment, O
he O
was O
reminded O
of O
Dr. O
all O
the O
staff O
members O
and O
the O
pattern, B-TARGET
who O
had O
even O
brought O
out O
the O
baseball O
bat. O

So O
I O
couldn't O
help O
but O
pay. O

I O
later O
referred O
to O
the O
police, O
but O
they O
couldn't O
do O
anything O
outside O
of O
a O
listening O
ear. O

So O
with O
this, O
I O
hope O
that O
the O
people O
here O
stay O
away O
and O
avoid O
their O
bad O
food B-TARGET
and O
their O
rotten, O
aggressive O
services. B-TARGET

Let O
the O
Astoria B-TARGET
Palace I-TARGET
ruin O
your O
case! O

Dirty O
thieves! O

Chicken B-TARGET
was O
dry, O
fish B-TARGET
was O
not O
tasty O
-- O
it's O
a O
really O
dirty O
smell O
-- O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
tasted O
like O
soap, O
chips B-TARGET
were O
sleepy O
and O
very O
fat, O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
not O
spicy, O
glasses B-TARGET
were O
not O
clean. O

And O
after O
we O
complained O
about O
these O
findings, O
people O
infuriatedly O
threw O
everything O
away O
and O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
full O
price. O

Staff B-TARGET
in O
dirty O
clothes, O
it O
didn't O
really O
look O
good O
inside. O

In O
short, O
with O
a O
huge O
bow O
around O
this O
facility. B-TARGET

Served O
and O
waited O
10 O
minutes O
outside O
with O
another O
couple O
who O
had O
to O
be O
there, O
waited O
three O
hours O
for O
a O
third O
appetizer, O
when O
we O
made O
the O
remarks, O
we O
were O
asked O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
be O
counted O
by O
the O
baker, O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
smile O
on O
the O
baker's B-TARGET
face O
when O
we O
decided O
to O
be O
counted, O
the O
chef B-TARGET
came O
to O
say, O
we O
don't O
respect O
the O
kitchen, O
we're O
people O
who O
eat O
regularly, O
but O
I O
haven't O
experienced O
that O
yet, O
unfortunately, O
but O
that's O
not O
how O
a O
customer O
wants O
to O
be O
treated O
when O
they O
pay O
a O
penny B-TARGET
bill, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
too O
long, O
sorry. O

Yesterday, O
I O
went O
to O
dinner O
at O
Boury, B-TARGET
sorry, O
but O
I O
don't O
understand O
that O
this O
is O
a O
star-worthy O
restaurant, O
the O
manager B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
restaurant O
leaves O
everything O
to O
be O
desired, O
there's O
no O
laughing O
matter, O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
meant O
to O
be O
warm O
were O
cold, O
the O
bill O
was O
peppery O
and O
not O
eaten O
well, O
a O
snake O
and O
a O
snake O
at O
the O
counter, O
sorry O
to O
hear, O
but O
if O
you O
pay O
this O
price, O
you O
still O
think O
that O
some O
people O
are O
serving O
to O
reconsider O
their O
minds, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant, O
but O
for O
me O
it O
was O
a O
bistro, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
kind O
and O
apologize O
at O
the O
table O
for O
the O
behavior O
of O
their O
masters, O
I O
really O
can't O
recommend O
this. O

and O
from O
the O
moment O
we O
entered, O
we O
were O
welcome. O

at O
the O
aperone O
followed O
by O
different O
applause. O

and O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
and O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
were O
really O
pictures. O

and O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
the O
dessert O
served B-TARGET
next O
to O
the O
coffee O
made O
it O
the O
perfect O
finish. O

the O
unusual O
wines B-TARGET
were O
really O
discoveries. O

In O
short, O
you O
should O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

a O
big O
compliment O
to O
the O
whole O
Boury B-TARGET
team. I-TARGET

It's O
a O
nice, O
original O
brewery B-TARGET
where O
you're O
always O
welcome O
and O
you O
get O
delicious O
fresh O
products. B-TARGET

But O
one O
of O
the O
downsides, O
I O
think, O
is O
that O
the O
price O
-- O
if O
you're O
two O
people, O
you're O
soon O
over O
120 O
euros. O

If O
you O
ever O
want O
to O
eat O
well O
when O
you're O
in O
Veurne, O
you've O
got O
to O
jump O
inside O
Lowie. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
cosy, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
really O
friendly, O
and O
especially O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

It's O
an O
authentic O
kitchen, B-TARGET
and O

I O
had O
a O
client O
named O
Veurne. O

I O
remember O
the O
last O
super O
night, O
so O
I O
didn't O
take O
any O
risks O
and O
I O
went O
to O
this O
brasseries. O

Crochets O
of O
watermelon, O
and O
other O
great O
home B-TARGET
specialties, I-TARGET
and O
suggestion, O
and O
so O
on. O

And O
to O
close O
with O
some O
funny O
anecdotes, O
my O
client O
was O
in O
the O
clouds. O

This O
is, O
to O
me, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
in O
Belgium, O
original O
dishes B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
the O
tailor-made O
menus, O
also O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
subtle. O

here, O
eating O
is O
an O
experience. O

Suitable O
meals O
for O
things O
that O
people O
didn't O
want O
were O
absolutely O
no O
problem. O

Great O
food, O
great O
service, B-TARGET
great O
wine. B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
the O
top O
of O
the O
bill O
with O
the O
forest O
walk. O

A O
forest O
treat O
made O
out O
of O
chocolate O
on O
a O
plate O
of O
branches O
and O
peanuts O
with O
morning O
arrows O
sticking O
out O
of O
a O
pot. O

This O
is O
really O
enjoyable! O

Why O
not O
two O
stars? O

Parking B-TARGET
and O
surroundings B-TARGET
not O
inviting, O
but O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
surprise O
inside. B-TARGET

careful O
yet O
family-friendly O
operation, B-TARGET
striking O
variations B-TARGET
on O
the O
boards O
and O
all O
those O
little O
taste O
buds O
that O
give O
you O
culinary O
delight. O

the O
chef B-TARGET
is O
really O
excited O
about O
his O
challenge O
to O
create O
new O
flavors. O

Perfect O
balance O
between O
enjoyable O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
a O
unique O
meal. B-TARGET

The O
chef O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
could O
live O
on O
a O
culinary O
level. O

And O
he O
did O
it O
in O
a O
wonderful O
way. O

Each O
dish B-TARGET
was O
a O
streak O
for O
the O
tongue O
and O
the O
eye. O

The O
blended O
wines B-TARGET
completely O
transformed O
this O
unique O
experience. O

You O
feel O
like O
the O
chef B-TARGET
and O
his O
master O
are O
doing O
this O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
passion. O

Thankfully, O
we're O
looking O
back O
on O
a O
good O
evening. O

Chef O
Marc, O
master O
Bert, O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
wonderful O
experience O
in O
your O
restaurant. B-TARGET

A O
real O
enrichment O
for O
the O
region O
with O
a O
great O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
service! B-TARGET

I'd O
love O
to O
come O
back! O

Mvg O
Kristof O

Very O
high O
culinary O
level O
and O
super O
friendly O
and O
skilled O
management. B-TARGET

Delicious O
combinations, B-TARGET
pure O
flavors, B-TARGET
excellent O
wine B-TARGET
choices, I-TARGET
just O
to O
name O
a O
few. O

It's O
also O
great O
for O
quick O
lunch. O

heartfelt O
welcome O
from O
the O
case B-TARGET
manager. I-TARGET

Cozy, O
crispy O
restaurant, B-TARGET
both O
downstairs O
and O
on O
the O
top O
floor O
-- O
three O
different O
rooms O
and O
all O
three O
cozy. O

We O
chose O
the O
menu O
called O
"Parels B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
India," I-TARGET
which O
is O
a O
recommendation O
for O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
try O
out O
different O
dishes O
from O
India. O

You O
get O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
an O
explanation O
for O
each O
dish O
every O
time, O
and O
which O
sauces O
work O
best O
for O
which O
dish. O

We O
could O
taste O
salmon, B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
in O
different O
ways. O

Very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
wines B-TARGET
(we O
chose O
the O
tailored O
wines). O

Everything's O
ready, O
you O
wait O
in O
India! O

Certainly O
a O
recommendation O
and O
a O
repeatable O
one. O

I O
certainly O
recommend O
it. O

If O
you've O
never O
tried O
the O
exotic O
kitchen O
before! O

And O
for O
those O
of O
you O
who O
prefer O
Belgian, O
there O
is O
also O
a O
Belgian O
kitchen. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
there's O
no O
problem O
for O
people O
who O
are O
very O
hungry. O

You O
get O
orders O
for O
rap. O

I've O
been O
there O
five O
times, O
and O
over O
and O
over O
again, O
Biryani O
is O
amazed O
by O
delicious O
dishes: B-TARGET
varied, O
delicious, O
yet O
not O
spicy, O
and O
all O
at O
a O
fair O
price. O

And O
the O
lunch O
is O
also O
a O
recommendation: O
a O
streak O
for O
all O
senses. O

The O
controls B-TARGET
are O
smooth O
and O
always O
with O
one O
word O
of O
explanation. O

and O
when O
Vicky, B-TARGET
the O
hostess, O
has O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
time, O
she'll O
come O
with O
the O
charm O
of O
Indian O
hospitality O
and O
find O
out O
for O
herself O
if O
everything's O
okay O
and O
if O
you O
enjoyed O
it. O

It's O
a O
brand O
new O
restaurant, O
it's O
been O
in O
operation O
since O
2013. O

Between O
the O
train O
station O
and O
downtown O
Ronse. O

Very O
friendly O
welcome. B-TARGET

Delicious O
food. B-TARGET

The O
Indira B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Not O
large O
amounts, O
but O
rather O
refined O
with O
a O
few O
extras. O

There's O
also O
a O
garden O
terrace O
and O
a O
sidewalk O
terrace. O

Closed O
on O
Tuesday. O

it's O
perfect O
to O
stop O
for O
a O
bicycle O
ride, O
it's O
right O
by O
the O
water, O
it's O
beautiful, O
it's O
quiet, O
it's O
good O
food, B-TARGET
nothing O
special, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
necessary. O

Formidable! O

The O
only O
word O
that O
fits O
to O
the O
wedding O
party O
of O
daughter O
Nathalie O
and O
stepdaughter O
Stijn O
on O
August O
2, O
2014, O
in O
this O
unique O
location. B-TARGET

From O
the O
boat O
ride O
offered O
at O
the O
wedding O
ceremony, O
through O
the O
enjoyable O
and O
extremely O
spontaneous O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
to O
the O
super O
tasty O
meals B-TARGET
and O
the O
happy O
faces O
of O
family O
and O
friends O
to O
the O
fantastic O
wedding O
cake! O

And O
this O
one O
with O
a O
shining O
sun: O
a O
day O
you'll O
never O
forget, O
and O
a O
recommendation O
to O
all O
of O
you. O

We've O
been O
eating O
here O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
in O
two O
years O
now, O
and O
we O
find O
the O
food B-TARGET
delicious O
over O
and O
over O
again, O
but O
nothing O
special O
about O
it. O

What O
we O
also O
noticed O
is O
that O
the O
menu B-TARGET
hasn't O
really O
changed O
much O
these O
days, O
which O
I O
personally O
find O
rather O
unfortunate. O

The O
controls B-TARGET
are O
pretty O
good O
depending O
on O
who O
or O
what O
-- O
one O
is O
a O
little O
more O
friendly O
than O
the O
other. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
really O
nice O
when O
you're O
outside O
and O
inside O
it's O
cosy. O

We've O
had O
dinner O
with O
Gwen O
and O
Philippe O
several O
times O
in O
the O
Keyserhof, B-TARGET
and O
we've O
always O
gone O
outside O
with O
a O
smile. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
food B-TARGET
delicious, O
their O
staff B-TARGET
deserve O
a O
big O
hug. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
on O
the O
Merry O
Way, O
which O
just O
makes O
your O
visit O
more O
cozy O
and O
romantic. O

Go O
on, O
Keyserhof! B-TARGET

bad O
and O
unpleasant O
management, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
bad. O

Wait O
two O
hours O
for O
your O
sangria B-TARGET
water O
meal, O
then O
get O
half-heated. O

The O
calculation B-TARGET
was O
four O
and O
a O
half O
euros O
wrong O
for O
us. O

The O
worst O
restaurant B-TARGET
we've O
ever O
been O
to. O

Stay O
out O
of O
there. O

a O
lot O
of O
people O
have O
heard O
about O
this, O
but O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
counter-intuitive, O
the O
so-called O
"everything O
self-made" O
guy O
came O
up O
against O
it O
quite O
a O
bit, O
rather O
a O
better O
hatchback, O
and O
the O
operating B-TARGET
system I-TARGET
was O
pretty O
awful, O
long O
waits, O
bad O
stuff O
on O
the O
table, O
clearly O
can't O
handle O
the O
pressure, O
clearly O
can't O
handle O
the O
operating O
system, O
and O
let O
the O
customers O
know O
this O
very O
clearly O
too, O
big O
counter-intuitive O

So O
back O
to O
our O
fabled O
tapas B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
in O
Herentals. O

And O
to O
our O
astonishment, O
new O
outlets O
and O
not O
as O
cozy O
and O
dark O
as O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
used O
to O
be. O

The O
new O
ones O
are O
coming O
directly O
from O
Spain, O
so O
we O
were O
expecting O
extra O
delicious O
tapas, O
but O
unfortunately, O
the O
look-alike B-TARGET
gambas I-TARGET
were O
served O
ropeless, O
not O
as O
delicious O
as O
you O
might O
expect, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
also O
ropeless. O

And O
unfortunately, O
I O
said O
something O
about O
it, O
and O
I O
ordered O
two O
new O
porridges, B-TARGET
but O
they're O
called, O
and O
it O
was O
delicious. O

But O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
wasn't O
there O
anymore, O
apparently O
gone O
with O
the O
previous O
excavators. O

I'm O
afraid O
next O
time O
you O
go O
to O
the O
big O
market O
in O
Herentals, O
there's O
also O
a O
lovely O
tapas O
bar. O

Let's O
try O
that O
one. O

cozy O
and O
simple. O

sometimes O
you O
get O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
current B-TARGET
developers, I-TARGET
unlike O
the O
previous O
developers, O
don't O
really O
have O
the O
full O
goo. O

Everybody's O
friendly, O
but O
it's O
hard O
to O
make O
a O
laugh. O

So, O
they O
do O
their O
best. O

Tastefully O
eaten O
in O
the O
romantic O
garden B-TARGET
by O
the O
water O
with O
the O
fish. O

Gamba's B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Indian I-TARGET
style I-TARGET
is O
super O
delicious. O

The O
operator B-TARGET
is O
always O
friendly O
and O
quick. O

The O
food B-TARGET
takes O
a O
little O
while, O
but O
it's O
worth O
the O
effort O
to O
wait O
because O
it's O
delicious O
and O
it's O
fresh. O

lunch O
is O
faster O
than O
dinner. O

In O
short, O
the B-TARGET
wild I-TARGET
evening I-TARGET
is O
our O
favorite O
here O
in O
Herentals. O

And O
we'll O
see O
you O
soon! O

Greetings. O

The O
Dutch O

Nice O
and O
cozy O
terrace, B-TARGET
good O
food, B-TARGET
pasta, O
meat, O
fish, O
anything O
you O
want. O

and O
very O
delicious O
desserts. B-TARGET

It's O
nice O
to O
be O
indoors O
too, O
but O
outside B-TARGET
in O
the O
summer O
it's O
really O
cool. O

The O
Wild O
Boar O
has O
a O
delicious O
interior B-TARGET
and O
a O
beautiful O
garden B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a O
pond. O

And O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
here O
who, O
if O
it's O
nice O
weather, O
can O
enjoy O
eating. O

or O
just O
plain O
classic O
-- O
for O
a O
good, O
quick O
lunch, B-TARGET
you O
can O
always O
get O
here. O

The O
arrangement B-TARGET
of O
the O
tables O
seems O
a O
little O
strange O
to O
me, O
a O
little O
unusual. O

It's O
not O
good O
for O
organizing O
a O
fun O
meal. O

on O
a O
Sunday O
night O
-- O
and O
apparently O
the O
staff B-TARGET
find O
it O
normal O
that O
there's O
hardly O
anything O
else O
to O
enjoy. O

The O
tortillas B-TARGET
that O
are O
normally O
served O
as O
snacks O
get O
eaten O
-- O
on. O

No O
excuses, O
just O
-- O
they're O
on. O

Beer, B-TARGET
various O
dishes B-TARGET
-- O
on. O

And O
finally, O
if O
I O
say O
this O
is O
weird, O
I O
just O
get O
the O
answer: O
it's O
Sunday O
night, O
which O
is O
normal O
after O
a O
busy O
weekend. O

In O
chi O
chi's, O
I O
don't O
expect O
any O
high-class O
culinaire, O
but O
at O
least O
the O
operator B-TARGET
must O
be O
correct O
and O
polite. O

A O
while O
back, O
we O
were O
going O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
Backhuys O
in O
downtown O
Texas. O

At O
25 O
degrees, O
having O
a O
nice O
dinner O
on O
a O
beautiful O
terrace, B-TARGET
which O
can O
be O
a O
lot O
more O
fun. O

I O
ordered O
steak O
steak O
grapes O
and O
steak O
sauce. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
over O
an O
hour O
for O
our O
meal. O

The O
steppe B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

But O
the O
steak B-TARGET
was O
completely O
baked O
and O
it O
was O
like O
a O
shoe O
seat. O

My O
friend's O
chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
juicy. O

I'm O
sorry O
for O
the O
meat B-TARGET
and O
the O
wait, O
but O
I O
deserved O
a O
second O
chance O
because O
of O
the O
location. B-TARGET

A O
nice O
reception, B-TARGET
a O
nice O
location, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
well O
served O
and O
a O
decent O
portion! O

I O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
fun O
evening. O

We O
were O
still O
having O
naps O
with O
a O
drink. O
This O
wasn't O
a O
problem, O
we O
weren't O
expelled. O

Located O
in O
Schoot, O
right O
next O
to O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
Merode O
and O
Gerhagen O
Natural O
Park, O
a O
mile O
and O
a O
half O
walk O
from O
the O
Abbot O
of O
Averbode. O

If O
it's O
nice, O
you O
can O
eat O
really O
nice O
food O
outside O
on O
a O
big, O
quiet, O
beautiful O
terrace. B-TARGET

If O
the O
weather O
isn't O
good O
enough, O
you O
can O
stay O
in O
the O
bustling O
area, O
or O
you O
can O
go O
all O
the O
way O
down O
to O
the O
old O
corner. O

Good O
management, B-TARGET
and O
the O
owners B-TARGET
are O
super O
friendly. O

Spacious O
parking O
for O
bicycles O
and O
cars O
alike. O

You O
can O
have O
really O
delicious O
steak B-TARGET
fried I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
or O
chicken. B-TARGET

There's O
a O
big O
terrace B-TARGET
and O
a O
nice O
outdoor B-TARGET
playground I-TARGET
for O
the O
kids. O

It O
was O
greeted O
by O
friends. O

It O
was O
delicious, O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
incredibly O
friendly, O
a O
recommendation. O

If O
we're O
in O
the O
vicinity, O
we're O
sure O
to O
come O
back. O

Price/quality O
is O
top. O

Two O
happy O
people O
from O
Wommelgem O

We'd O
been O
staying O
at O
the O
Van O
Eyck O
Hotel, O
crossing O
the O
market, O
and O
we'd O
been O
in O
this O
really O
nice O
little O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
really O
nice. O

We're O
certainly O
going O
to O
come O
back. O

Nicole O
and O
Johan O
from O
West O
Flanders O

For O
gourmets O
and O
people O
who O
want O
something O
different O
than O
cheese O
fries. O

Let O
me O
surprise O
you. O

I O
was O
shocked O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
was O
only O
one O
menu B-TARGET
out O
there, O
but O
it O
was O
so O
delicious O
eating O
and O
drinking. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
different, O
this O
is O
something O
you O
can O
discuss. O

Two O
people B-TARGET
who O
know O
their O
job O
very O
well, O
they're O
very O
welcoming, O
and O
if O
the O
service O
allows, O
they'd O
love O
to O
have O
a O
chat O
with O
their O
guests. O

We're O
glad O
we O
found O
this O
nice O
address, B-TARGET
and O
we'll O
definitely O
go O
back! O

They O
just O
forgot O
us. O

Varkenshaas B-TARGET
were O
almost O
raw, O
and O
you O
had O
to O
look O
for O
the O
meat B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
sink. I-TARGET

Very O
unfriendly, O
as O
if O
they O
don't O
like O
it O
when O
you O
come O
to O
eat O
something. O

It's O
worthless. O

In O
the O
afternoon, O
we're O
going O
to O
eat O
at O
Den O
Cleynen O
Keyser. O

Personally B-TARGET
unfriendly, O
even O
twice O
asked O
for O
a O
card. O

Order O
came O
in O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half! O

One O
of O
them O
was O
curry-flavored B-TARGET
fetuccine, I-TARGET
which O
is O
really O
bad O
we've O
let O
go, O
two O
of O
them O
were O
grilled B-TARGET
scampi I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
a O
vegetable O
dish, O
which O
was O
served O
in O
a O
delicious O
lookroom B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
not O
in O
a O
vegetable O
dish, O
side-by-side O
liquor. B-TARGET

In O
addition O
to O
that, O
a O
steak O
with O
pepper O
sauce, B-TARGET
which O
was O
a O
reasonable O
steak B-TARGET
again, O
was O
delicious. O

Wine B-TARGET
from O
tap, O
also O
dirty, O
no O
other O
wine B-TARGET
to O
order! O

The O
maid, B-TARGET
I O
think O
my O
daughter, O
was O
asked O
three O
times O
for O
the O
free O
Wi-Fi O
access O
code, O
and O
she O
couldn't O
remember O
(!) O
So O
I O
didn't O
get O
this? O

Then O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
offer O
it! O

And O
then O
when O
we O
calculated O
-- O
100 O
euros O
-- O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
didn't O
ask O
us O
if O
it O
made O
us O
happy, O
which O
was O
obvious O
because O
the O
boards O
weren't O
empty. O

And O
then O
the O
owner B-TARGET
came O
in O
and O
asked O
if O
it O
had O
made O
any O
difference, O
and O
I've O
made O
it O
very O
clear O
that O
it O
didn't. O

And O
the O
gentleman B-TARGET
walked O
away, O
and O
then O
he O
stopped O
looking O
at O
me, O
and O
he O
stopped O
doing O
anything O
with O
my O
answer. O

My O
advice O
is, O
go O
eat O
somewhere O
else. O

It's O
worthless. O

Nice O
personal O
welcome B-TARGET

surprising O

the O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
Peter O
Goosens O
a O
real O

It's O
nice O
to O
guarantee O
that O
quality O
every O
day O
over O
and O
over O
again O
-- O
we're O
sure O
to O
enjoy O
it O
again! O

From O
champagne B-TARGET
to O
coffee, B-TARGET
everything's O
fine. O

Very O
friendly O
operation. B-TARGET

They're O
not O
cheap, O
but O
they're O
certainly O
worth O
the O
money. O

Very O
good O
wines. B-TARGET

we're O
here O
a O
few O
times O
a O
year, O
and O
they O
always O
manage O
