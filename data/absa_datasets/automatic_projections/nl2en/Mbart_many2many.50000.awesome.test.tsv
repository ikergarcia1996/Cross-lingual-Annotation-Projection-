We O
ate O
really O
good O
food O
here. O

Although O
I O
read O
in O
advance O
that O
the O
chef O
determines O
what O
you O
eat, O
this O
isn't O
right, O
or O
the O
restaurant O
has O
modified O
it. O

because O
there O
was O
a O
menu, B-TARGET
either O
three O
or O
four O
corridors, O
with O
three O
to O
four O
choices O
per O
corridor. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
far O
enough, O
certainly O
because O
the O
restaurant O
is O
famous O
for O
its O
Wagyu O
cattle O
and O
its O
Mangalica O
pigs, O
so O
they O
tend O
to O
choose O
these O
options. O

If O
you're O
not O
a O
meat O
lover, O
there's O
always O
a O
fish O
option. O

Summary: O
good O
service, B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
beautiful O
location. B-TARGET

All O
of O
this O
at O
a O
very O
attractive O
price. O

Managing: B-TARGET
running O
your O
business O
through O
unreliable O
job O
seekers O
is O
never O
a O
good O
business. O

Obviously O
understaffed, O
waiting O
way O
too O
long O
for O
water, O
bread, O
wine, O

No O
knowledge O
of O
the O
wine O
map, O
let O
alone O
the O
wines B-TARGET
per O
glass. O
Too O
limited, O
by O
the O
way. O

Eating: B-TARGET
Rare O
combinations, O
a O
bite B-TARGET
in O
advance O
doesn't O
stimulate O
appetite O
-- O
too O
spicy, O
too O
complex. O

not O
a O
refined, O
chilled B-TARGET
bluefin I-TARGET
that O
was O
dominated O
by O
an O
overweight O
octopus. O

Wild B-TARGET
boar I-TARGET
was O
okay, O
but O
the O
smoke O
was O
too O
much. O

The O
main O
judge O
was O
insane B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
saltwater, I-TARGET
very O
good, O
correct, O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
it. O

Lamsossobuco B-TARGET
-- O
it O
was O
a O
lamb's O
mouth O
-- O
be O
honest O
with O
your O
card. O

Conclusion: O
I O
had O
expected O
a O
lot O
more O
from O
the O
reputation. O

Price-quality O
ratio O
seems O
fine O
to O
me, O
but O
put O
experienced O
people B-TARGET
in O
the O
room O
and O
improve O
your O
personal O
touch O
with O
the O
neighborhood. O

I O
don't O
think O
I'll O
be O
back O
soon. O

Rarely O
tables O
at O
a O
bistro B-TARGET
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere. O

The O
Royal B-TARGET
all-inclusive I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
taken O
at O
a O
democratic O
cost O
of O
42 O
dollars. O

Amusement, O
appetizer, O
sorbet, O
main O
course, O
and O
the O
chef's O
plate O
for O
dessert. O

This O
is O
with O
water O
and O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
per O
person. O

A O
real O
recommendation, O
where O
the O
Rossini B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
was O
perfectly O
baked O
and O
very O
rare. O

I'm O
sure O
to O
come O
back O
to O
that. O

Obviously, O
also O
a O
la O
carte. O

You O
can O
also O
have O
a O
nice O
drink O
on O
the O
terrace. O

Restaurant O
the O
Southern O
Pearl O
is O
closed, O
and O
it's O
made O
a O
comeback O
as O
a O
cafe O
brewery. O

And O
what O
this O
means O
is O
that O
they've O
invested O
heavily O
in O
quality O
without O
the O
new O
concepts O
of O
intimacy, O
low O
friction, O
bistro. O

Small O
but O
enjoyable O
business B-TARGET
with O
great O
management. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
very O
limited O
card, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
very O
good. O

We O
took O
an O
appetizer, O
a O
main O
course, O
a O
side O
course, O
and O
everything O
was O
perfect. O

The O
price O
actually O
did O
come O
down. O
It O
was O
about O
60 O
euros O
per O
person O
for O
wine O
and O
coffee. O

Unfortunately, O
they're O
only O
open O
during O
the O
week. O

(Laughter) O
(Applause) O

Management B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
very O
nice O
trendy O
retro B-TARGET
interior. I-TARGET

Teaser, B-TARGET
very O
good. O

Good O
price/quality O
+ O
ambiance! B-TARGET

Remarkable! O

Just O
the O
second O
time O
I've O
been O
on O
this O
show. O

Again, O
we O
were O
put O
in O
the O
watts O
as O
culinary O
creatures, O
and O
we O
were O
able O
to O
enjoy O
incredibly O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
presented O
as O
artwork. O

All O
of O
this O
wrapped O
up O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
dry O
humor O
and O
the O
original O
concept, B-TARGET
makes O
this O
one O
of O
my O
favorites. O

Culinair O
top O
level O
for O
an O
honest O
price! O

My O
favorite! O

Pleasure O
from O
beginning O
to O
end. O

Fantastic O
taste O
buds O
with O
surprising O
structures O
and O
combinations O
-- O
every O
dish B-TARGET
is O
an O
artwork. O

Pure O
class! O

And O
I O
also O
really O
love O
the O
little O
bit O
of O
humor O
that O
you O
can O
find O
everywhere. O

an O
experience O
that O
you'd O
love O
to O
smile O
back O
at O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
the O
next O
reservation. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
and O
the O
ambiance B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
are O
great. O

The O
controls B-TARGET
are O
correct, O
but O
they O
could O
be O
better. O

We O
didn't O
find O
the O
typical O
Thai O
kindness O
and O
warmth. O

We O
ate O
the O
Discovery O
menu. O

Based O
on O
what O
we've O
been O
given, O
we O
wouldn't O
want O
to O
pay O
the O
full O
price. O

Earlier, O
smaller O
portions B-TARGET
-- O
which O
may O
still O
be O
acceptable O
from O
the O
standpoint O
of O
the O
bean O
-- O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
warmer O
than O
ice O
cream. O

It O
was O
certainly O
fresh, O
but O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
flawed. O

We O
ended O
up O
with O
a O
Groupon O
ticket O
to O
this O
restaurant. O

Had O
signed O
up O
for O
a O
Discovery O
set O
menu. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
in O
itself, O
but O
we O
felt O
like O
the O
action O
at O
the O
moment O
was O
holding O
half O
of O
the O
price O
up O
to O
half O
of O
the O
normal O
portion. B-TARGET

It O
was O
so O
low O
that O
we O
went O
out O
very O
disappointed, O
even O
though O
the O
action O
price O
still O
seemed O
a O
lot O
to O
us O
for O
what O
we O
were O
getting. O

I'm O
not O
a O
big O
eater, O
but O
it O
was O
just O
ridiculously O
small, O
and O
I O
don't O
think O
we O
could O
have O
found O
100 O
grams O
of O
meat/chicken/scampi B-TARGET
in O
total. O

And O
then O
there's B-TARGET
this O
little O
soup O
party, O
which O
also O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
for O
both O
of O
us. O

(The O
picture O
on O
the O
discovery O
menu O
site O
is O
correct, O
but O
it O
just O
looks O
like O
you're O
getting O
ice O
cream O
per O
person O
per O
two.) O

Eat O
here O
last O
Friday. O

It O
was O
very, O
very O
good O
again. O

It's O
going O
to O
be O
okay. O

Eating B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
fresh O
Belgian O
dishes O
good O
beer B-TARGET
/ O

but O
also O
very, O
very O
good, O
delicious, O
rich O
breakfast. B-TARGET

Price-quality O
ratio O
is O
very O
good. O

Very O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

It's O
nice O
to O
sit O
outside O
in O
the O
sun. O

We're O
going O
to O
come O
back. O

It's O
a O
restaurant O
on O
a O
square. O

A O
funny O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Fantastic O
welcoming O
staff. B-TARGET

You O
really O
feel O
at O
home O
there. O

(Welcome) O

Very O
good O
quality, B-TARGET
beautifully O
crafted O
boards, B-TARGET
good O
portions, O
(no O
sticks) O
100 O
percent O
recommendation. O

Wild O
Vegan O
pasta O
children's O
menu O

If O
you O
go O
to O
lunch, O
you're O
going O
to O
have O
shrimp O
cocktails. O

It's O
delicious. O

It's O
always O
a O
party O
to O
eat O
here. O

For O
50 O
euros, O
you O
can O
enjoy O
the O
fantastic O
Thai B-TARGET
kitchen, I-TARGET
the O
personalized O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
cosy O
home O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

First O
we O
had O
an O
aperitif O
in O
the O
beautiful O
garden, B-TARGET
and O
then O
we O
had O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

Especially O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
really O
good O
for O
us. O

Definitely O
a O
recommendation, O
with O
two O
or O
in O
a O
group. O

Book O
now! O

fantastically O
delicious, O
wonderful O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
unique O
combinations, O
and O
finally, O
no O
stubborn O
manipulation. B-TARGET

And O
one O
of O
the O
flaws O
I O
found O
was O
the O
messy O
framework. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
very O
noisy O
group O
sitting O
next O
to O
us, O
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
inadequately O
heated O
so O
that O
I O
sometimes O
had O
difficulty O
understanding O
each O
other. O

And O
besides, O
it's O
pretty O
cheap, O
but O
you're O
getting O
absolutely O
what O
you O
pay O
for. O

A O
recommendation! O

Yesterday, O
the O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
test O
at O
Ninove, O
and O
we O
were O
all O
very O
happy. O

was O
very O
nice O
and O
very O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
we're O
certainly O
still O
doing O
this. O

And O
hopefully O
many O
more O
people O
will O
discover O
this O
place. O

In O
September, O
they're O
going O
to O
start O
a O
buffet, O
and O
we're O
definitely O
going O
to O
try O
everything! O

A O
real O
recommendation. O

Go O
out O
and O
eat O
some O
delicious O
Indian O
food O
like O
we O
do O
in O
London. O

Order O
a O
vegetable B-TARGET
soup: I-TARGET
just O
a O
bad O
minestrone O
with O
floating O
vegetable O
blocks O
in O
the O
moist O
air. O

And O
then O
you O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait, O
and O
in O
the O
meantime, O
your O
drink O
is O
already O
up O
and O
nobody O
has O
seen O
it. O

And O
finally O
came O
the O
main O
course. O

a O
real O
disappointment O
in O
terms O
of O
taste O
and O
texture. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
serve O
Indian O
food, O
do O
it O
the O
Indian O
way, O
with O
lots O
of O
little O
dishes O
in O
little O
sausages O
and O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
spicy O
rice. O

An O
Indian O
menu O
can't O
consist O
of O
soup, O
dessert, O
main O
course, O
dessert O
like O
Western O
cuisine. O

Try O
to O
stay O
original! O

I O
have O
to O
be O
honest, O
this O
is O
the O
least O
good O
Indian B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
eaten. O

There's O
also O
never O
a O
people, O
which O
of O
course O
is O
a O
sign. O

We're O
going O
to O
eat O
there O
with O
a O
banana. O

We O
did O
get O
enough, O
we O
did O
get O
enough, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
really O
very O
tasty. O

Friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
delivery B-TARGET
guy I-TARGET
is O
always O
ready O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
even O
when O
it's O
busy. O

The O
controls B-TARGET
are O
very O
smooth. O

You O
never O
have O
to O
wait O
very O
long O
for O
delicious O
pies. B-TARGET

It's O
definitely O
a O
good O
recommendation, O
even O
if O
you O
want O
to O
sit O
still O
in O
the O
crowded O
restaurant O
area. O

Good O
ice O
cream, B-TARGET
nowhere O
in O
Hasselt O
can O
you O
get O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
for O
these O
prices. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quick O
and O
friendly, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
cosy. O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
there's O
something O
you O
can O
do O
to O
the O
drainage O
system O
-- O
if O
they O
already O
have O
one O
-- O
if O
you're O
in O
there O
for O
five O
minutes, O
everyone O
can O
smell O
you O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
Marmite. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
better O
dishes B-TARGET
brought O
to O
you O
at O
democratic O
prices. O

Today O
we're O
going O
to O
try O
mosquitos. O

More O
later. O

The O
tapas B-TARGET
that O
were O
there O
before O
were O
a O
kind O
of O
countermeasure. O

The O
chef O
serves O
the O
right O
beer O
for O
every O
dish. O

The O
wine O
we've O
left O
behind O
today. O

Extraordinary O
welcome O
from O
a O
lovely O
host. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
small O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
very O
cosy. O
You O
absolutely O
have O
to O
book. O

The O
map B-TARGET
changes O
regularly O
and O
is O
small. O

I O
always O
think O
that's O
an O
advantage O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
come O
to O
the O
table O
are O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
delicious, O
along O
with O
the O
excellent O
wine O
advice O
of O
the O
host. B-TARGET

This O
is O
pure O
baloney. O

It's B-TARGET
very O
cozy, O
it's B-TARGET
very O
high-quality O
food. O

with O
a O
bon O
to O
la O
vache O
qui O
suisse. O

After O
lots O
of O
booby O
traps, O
we O
ate O
really O
good O
food O
here, O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
original, O
e.g. O
the O
potatoes B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
jar I-TARGET
in O
a O
juicy O
bag, O
beautiful! O

we're O
going O
to O
go O
back O
to O
this, O
for O
example, O
for O
a O
cheese O
fondue O
-- O
smells O
very O
good, O
too. O

You O
get O
what O
you O
expect. O

Good O
food, B-TARGET
good O
service. B-TARGET

Nothing O
to O
notice. O

Obviously, O
more O
fun O
in O
the O
winter O
months O
than O
in O
the O
summer, O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
whirlwind. O

It O
was O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
that O
I O
was O
in O
Orangerie. O

Never O
again! O

Scampi B-TARGET
in O
a O
thick O
flowery O
sauce O
doesn't O
taste O
good. O

Steak B-TARGET
beef: I-TARGET
the O
sauce O
was O
too O
thick O
and O
too O
cold O
to O
pour O
over O
the O
meat. O

It's O
disappointing. O

Even O
from O
a O
pot, O
it's O
better. O

Fries B-TARGET
were O
a O
strange O
bee. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
had O
a O
straw B-TARGET
bale I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cod I-TARGET
where O
you O
could O
put O
a O
fork O
straight O
in. O

Personally, B-TARGET
it O
was O
nice, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
sort O
of O
quickly O
decide O
what O
we O
wanted, O
even O
though O
there O
was O
only O
one O
other O
couple O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Never O
again!!! O

You'd O
pay O
110 O
bucks O
for O
something O
you O
wouldn't O
get O
in O
a O
box. O

Better O
location, B-TARGET
better O
land. B-TARGET

The O
management B-TARGET
is O
nonchalant O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
slow. O

If O
the O
case O
is O
full, O
there's O
a O
problem O
-- O
which O
translates O
into O
slow O
operation B-TARGET
and O
errors. O

The O
nicoise B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
isn't O
really O
that O
great O
-- O
it's O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
tuna O
with O
bacon, O
not O
much O
inspiration. O

I'm O
sorry, O
because O
for O
the O
price O
you O
ask, O
you O
really O
expect O
more O
of O
this O
fun O
thing. B-TARGET

And O
it's O
also O
really O
delicious. O

We O
followed O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
chef: O
the O
flat B-TARGET
oysters I-TARGET
are O
inside, O
and O
they O
were O
delicious. O

It's O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that's O
famous O
for O
its O
beautifully O
crispy O
pork B-TARGET
(entrecote, O
fillet, O
steak), O
but O
also O
for O
its O
delicious O
shrimp B-TARGET
cocktails, I-TARGET
steak. O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
quick O
and O
friendly O
but O
sometimes O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
personal O
touch O
due O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

separate O
entrance B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
personal O
reporting B-TARGET
every O
single O
look O
in O
the O
ancient O
interior O
illuminated O
or O
an O
old O
pop, O
jewellery, O
handbag. O
Very O
detailed O
operation B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
quality B-TARGET
craftsmanship. I-TARGET

Very O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
nostalgia O
we O
ate O
shrimp O
menu O
Eliot O
never O
ate O
so O
delicious O
shrimp B-TARGET
very O
fresh O
and O
done O
in O
a O
delicious O
way O
the O
management B-TARGET
is O
top O
very O
social O
and O
these O
people O
know O
how O
to O
serve O
the O
customers O
really O
top O
does O
all O
this O

When O
you're O
in O
Ghent, O
you O
have O
to O
go! O

Great O
shrimp B-TARGET
restaurant. I-TARGET

It B-TARGET
can O
be O
obtained O
in O
many O
different O
ways. O

Very O
juicy O
and O
delicious. O

In O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
itself, O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
thrill O
to O
the O
atmosphere O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Friendly O
service! B-TARGET

The O
new O
site O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
inside O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
Mariott O
Hotel O
looks O
prestigious, O
and O
it O
is. O

This O
primary O
schoolteacher B-TARGET
stays O
better O
at O
reading. O

A O
previous O
visit O
to O
the O
restaurant O
in O
the O
Lowlands O
was O
pretty O
good: O
beautiful O
wine O
lists, O
sophisticated O
menus. O

Recently, O
I O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
with O
clients O
in O
the O
new O
location. O

Just O
one O
menu B-TARGET
item I-TARGET
to O
choose O
from, O
the O
full O
menu O
or O
the O
highlighted O
version O
(by O
dragging O
through O
one O
or O
more O
corridors), O
filled O
with O
a O
few O
à O
la O
carte O
options. O

The O
strength O
of O
a O
kitchen B-TARGET
can O
be O
found O
in O
simplicity, O
and O
this O
one O
was O
really, O
really O
simple O
for O
wines O
that O
cost O
about O
50 O
bucks, O
and O
for O
wines O
that O
cost O
about O
50 O
bucks, O
in O
Ghent, O
you O
can O
do O
better O
than O
this: O
Karel O
de O
Stoute, O
House O
of O
Elliott, O
Grade, O
etc. O

Moreover, O
younger O
waiters B-TARGET
could O
be O
more O
professionally O
manned. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
is O
what's O
going O
to O
be O
called O
a O
"built-out," O
it's O
furnished, O
it's O
just O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
hotel O
experience. O

After O
all, O
there O
was O
no O
dust O
to O
detect O
on O
the O
tables, O
because O
they O
were O
neatly O
folded. O

In O
a O
restaurant O
like O
le O
Grand O
Bleu, O
that's O
a O
hallmark O
of O
style, O
given O
the O
perennial O
style: O
old O
tables, O
mixed O
chairs, O
etc. O

Here, O
it's O
a O
cold O
impression, O
combined O
with O
the O
raw O
execution O
of O
the O
dishes, O

This O
restaurant, B-TARGET
as O
a O
bourgeois O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
fine O
kitchen, O
I'm O
going O
to O
let O
go O
of O
it O
in O
the O
future. O

Much O
ado O
about O
nothing! O

We O
had O
reservations O
for O
the O
morning, O
and O
when O
we O
got O
there, O
it O
was O
still O
looking O
out O
for O
a O
table. O

Table B-TARGET
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
kitchen O
sink, O
intimate O
two-course O
dinner, O
set O
next O
to O
loud O
Eastern O
folk O
(not O
really O
ideal). O

Aperitive B-TARGET
Hugo, I-TARGET
very O
delicious, O
beautifully O
presented. O

We O
used O
to O
have O
three O
hallways O
menus O
with O
white O
glass O
for O
starters O
and O
red O
glass O
for O
main O
courses. O

The B-TARGET
last I-TARGET
one O
we've O
never O
seen O
-- O

Happiness B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
beef O
stew. O

For B-TARGET
starters, I-TARGET
I O
didn't O
think O
it O
was O
convincing, O
and O
I O
didn't O
think O
it O
was O
cold O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
cold O
starter, O
and O
I O
didn't O
think O
it O
was O
too O
snug O
to O
be O
a O
warm O
starter. O

The B-TARGET
main I-TARGET
course I-TARGET
was O
good O
in O
taste O
-- O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
good O
-- O
but O
the O
potatoes B-TARGET
weren't O
baked O
toast, O
and O
the O
duck O
was O
delicious. O

Dessert B-TARGET
was O
disappointing. O
Eleven O
came O
after O
the O
main O
course, O
and O
the O
chocolates O
that O
were O
on O
the O
menu O
couldn't O
be O
found. O

Personally, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
disappointed O
in O
the O
price/quality. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
very O
delicious, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
quick, O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly!! O

Top O
restaurant B-TARGET
;-) O

The O
appearance O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
looks O
simple, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
absolutely O
not! O

Cards B-TARGET
are O
special O
because O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
pizza. O

Management B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly. O

I'm O
kind O
of O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
your O
ice B-TARGET
cream, O
so O
I've O
had O
ice O
cream O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
places, O
but O
this O
is O
really O
the O
best O
ice O
cream O
I've O
ever O
had! O

Mmmmmm. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
the O
next O
visit! O

When O
I O
was O
in O
Leuven, O
I O
saw O
Decadenza O
grow O
into O
a O
popular O
business. O

Now O
I O
live O
in O
Berlin, O
and O
every O
time O
I O
come O
back O
to O
Belgium, O
I'm O
almost O
like O
going O
to O
Leuven O
for O
a O
real O
iceberg B-TARGET
from O
Decadenza. O

Best O
I've O
ever O
had! O

Good O
price O
and O
good O
quality. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
in O
Belgian O
terms. O

Wide O
choice O
on O
the O
map B-TARGET
with O
lots O
of O
variation. O

eaten O
in O
a O
near-empty O
restaurant. O

That's O
not O
bad O
in O
itself, O
but O
the O
operators B-TARGET
were O
more O
concerned O
with O
each O
other O
than O
they O
were O
with O
the O
guests. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
very O
long O
before O
it O
was O
picked O
up O
and O
recorded O
for O
dessert. O

The O
music B-TARGET
that O
doesn't O
fit O
neatly O
into O
a O
restaurant, O
all O
of O
a O
sudden, O
during O
dinner, O
was O
played O
out O
loud. O

It O
wasn't O
possible O
to O
have O
coins O
with O
an O
nl O
bank O
pass. O

Credit O
cards O
were O
not O
accepted O
either. O

It O
was O
delicious O
to O
eat O
at O
a O
very O
affordable O
price. O

The O
ham B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
sausage O
is O
a O
juicy O
piece O
of O
ham O
with O
a O
delicious O
salad. O

The O
homemade O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse, I-TARGET
as O
a O
side O
treat, O
could O
still O
be O
used. O

We're O
definitely O
coming O
back! O

We O
ate O
the O
jars B-TARGET
at O
30 O
cents, O
they O
were O
tasteless O
and O
very O
tiny. O

And O
also, O
the O
wine, B-TARGET
14 O
euros O
for O
a O
small O
half-liter, O
didn't O
represent O
anything. O

Apparently, O
and O
hopefully, O
you're O
better O
served O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
meat O
here. O

Person O
X O

A O
concept O
in O
Leuven O
with O
the O
classic O
Italian B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
with O
some O
adaptations O
for O
the O
Belgian O
chefs. O

It's O
probably O
50 O
years O
old, O
and O
it's O
still O
faithful O
to O
itself. O

I O
was O
walking O
there O
every O
day, O
and O
I O
kept O
seeing O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
coming O
in, O
so O
I O
thought O
I'd O
go O
in. O

Management B-TARGET
was O
fine, O
interior B-TARGET
pretty O
boring O
and O
old. O

Eating B-TARGET
was O
a O
disappointment. O

For O
example, O
a O
fishnet B-TARGET
was O
cold O
and O
not O
fresh O
at O
all. O

And O
for O
that O
price, O
you're O
much O
better O
off O
going O
to O
eat O
in O
Leuven O
if O
you O
know O
the O
good O
places. O

I O
can't O
say O
it O
was O
great, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
bad O
either. O

both O
for O
the O
operation O
and O
for O
the O
food. O

I O
also O
think O
it's O
a O
little O
bit O
expensive O
for O
what O
we've O
gotten. O

Very O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

Boards B-TARGET
that O
are O
not O
washed O
properly, O
they O
look O
fat. O

Crustacean B-TARGET
meat, I-TARGET
just O
from O
the O
fridge. O

Fries B-TARGET
from O
the O
fridge. O

Money O
is O
definitely O
not O
worth O
it. O

What O
a O
disappointment. O

It's O
very O
tasty. O

Price O
quality O
excellent. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

A O
ham O
with O
peanut O
sauce. O

The O
water O
comes O
back O
into O
my O
mouth. O

To O
me, O
Zeno B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
top O
restaurants O
in O
Bruges. O

What O
you O
get O
there O
is O
just O
unbelievable. O

From O
the O
amuses O
to O
the O
delicacies O
of O
the O
coffee, O
everything O
is O
great! O

We've O
eaten O
at O
Zeno B-TARGET
three O
times O
already, O
and O
each O
time O
it O
was O
a O
culinary O
delight. O

Also, O
if O
you O
go O
to O
the O
cheaper O
menu, O
sometimes O
during O
the O
week, O
the O
amuses O
and O
the O
migraine O
dishes O
are O
served O
the O
same O
as O
if O
you O
went O
to O
the O
big O
menu. O

The O
only O
downside O
for O
me O
is O
the O
cool O
interior, B-TARGET
but O
that O
certainly O
won't O
stop O
me O
from O
going O
to O
Zeno. O

And O
because O
of O
the O
endless O
and O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
it's O
really O
enjoyable. O

Zeno B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
recommendation O
and O
certainly O
a O
Michelin O
star. O

I O
had O
delicious O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant O
last O
night. O

It's O
a O
bit O
out O
of O
the O
center, O
so O
it's O
not O
very O
crowded O
with O
tourists. O

It O
was O
full O
of O
bushes, O
but O
fortunately O
we O
had O
reservations. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
to O
take O
a O
bite O
here, O
call O
me O
in O
advance. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
nicely O
set O
up. O

It O
looks O
like O
you're O
going O
back O
in O
time O
a O
few O
years. O

Nice O
background O
music, O
lots O
of O
stuff O
on O
the O
wall O
and O
great O
chairs. O

We O
were O
helped O
by O
a O
nice, O
spontaneous O
woman. B-TARGET

Respecting O
her, B-TARGET
walking O
around O
11 O
tables O
on O
your O
own O
is O
quite O
a O
challenge. O

It O
didn't O
take O
long O
for O
her O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
way O
and O
take O
time O
for O
everyone. O

We O
had O
chosen O
mosquitos O
and O
a O
steak O
turtle. O

It O
tasted O
delicious, O
and O
the O
price-quality O
ratio O
is O
really O
good. O

I O
can O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
everybody O
with O
all O
my O
heart. O

Excellent O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
chose O
the O
German B-TARGET
screwdriver, I-TARGET
and O
this O
one O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
great. O

A O
very O
royal O
portion B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
Belgian B-TARGET
fries. I-TARGET

And O
the O
well-priced O
house B-TARGET
meat, I-TARGET
which O
was O
recommended, O
was O
a O
great O
match. O

Very O
friendly O
operation. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
bit O
out O
of O
the O
center, O
but O
the O
walk O
is O
rewarded O
with O
a O
very O
good O
meal. B-TARGET

A O
recommendation, O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

X O
and O
Y. O

It's O
good O
to O
eat. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

Here, O
without O
thinking O
about O
it, O
I O
would O
go O
and O
eat O
a O
second O
time. O

And O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
a O
great O
recommendation. O

Bruges O
is O
a O
beautiful O
city. O

The O
ribbons B-TARGET
were O
delicious! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
very O
helpful. O

Nachos B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
very O
delicious O
in O
advance. O
And O
lots O
of O
small O
portions B-TARGET
are O
easy O
to O
eat O
with O
three O
people. O

Meat B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
delicious. O

Book O
it O
in O
advance. O

This O
is O
where O
perfection O
is O
pursued. O

Sweet O
cookies B-TARGET
and O
the O
raisin B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
is O
perfect. O

Friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
and O
top O
patissier!!!! B-TARGET

super-lighter, O
super-strong, O
original O
patisseries B-TARGET
with O
super-friendly O
operators, B-TARGET
that's O
about O
it. O
And O
in O
terms O
of O
price, O
you O
pay O
for O
quality, O
and O
in O
that O
sense, O
they're O
even O
cheaper. O

Books B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
fantastic! O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
very O
fresh, O
well-balanced, O
lots O
of O
choice, O
very O
good O
coffee B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chocolate. I-TARGET

So O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
great. O

The O
controls B-TARGET
are O
really O
fast. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
was O
very O
kind O
and O
spontaneous. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is O
also O
fun. O

You're O
sitting O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
nicely O
arranged O
books. O

The O
books O
can O
also O
be O
purchased. O

also O
fun! O

for O
Brugge, O
this O
cosy O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
plus! O

and O
it's O
a O
great O
honor O
for O
the O
developers. O

we're O
glad O
we O
found O
Books B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Brunch! I-TARGET

Books B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
things O
Bruges O
has O
to O
offer. O

I O
discovered O
this O
place O
when O
it O
opened O
recently, O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
this O
cosy, O
bustling O
establishment, B-TARGET
and O
I O
still O
am. O

And O
the O
concept B-TARGET
is, O
of O
course, O
something O
unique O
in O
Bruges, O
and O
something O
that O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
reason O
for O
your O
visit, O
you O
always O
turn O
around O
and O
look O
through O
the O
books. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
fresh, O
and O
you O
can O
taste O
it O
if O
you O
don't O
force O
it. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
at O
Books O
& O
Brunch O
is O
so O
wonderful, O
you O
can O
come O
over O
for O
lunch O
or O
coffee O
or O
tea. O

There's O
optimal O
intimacy, O
calmness, O
and O
everything O
is O
not O
pushed O
and O
done O
with O
ease O
without O
appearing O
to O
be O
lax. O

The B-TARGET
lady I-TARGET
who O
handles O
the O
case O
deserves O
an O
acknowledgment O
of O
kindness. O

It's O
a O
delicious O
place B-TARGET
to O
come O
and O
have O
lunch O
with O
your O
girlfriend O
or O
your O
mom O
or O
your O
girlfriend O
or O
just O
come O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
cup O
of O
tea B-TARGET
or I-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
and O
read O
a O
book O
or O
enjoy O
free O
WiFi O
on O
your O
MacBook O
or O
your O
iPhone. O

Books B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
gem O
amongst O
all O
the O
tourist O
restaurants O
and O
cafes O
that O
dominate O
Bruges. O

Nice O
tent, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
delicious O
home-made B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
tea. I-TARGET

It's O
only O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
so O
restrictive O
in O
terms O
of O
food, O
otherwise O
we'd O
eat O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
it. O

If O
you're O
a O
vegetarian, O
it's O
pretty O
obvious O
to O
find O
a O
good O
restaurant, O
but O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
be O
told O
that O
"vegetarian" O
just O
means O
leave O
your O
meat O
out. O

For O
all O
the O
people O
who O
have O
the O
same O
problem, O
here's O
the O
solution. O

And O
after O
a O
while O
of O
searching O
on O
the O
Internet, O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
reservation O
here O
for O
Sunday O
night, O

In O
the O
end, O
it O
wasn't O
too O
busy O
that O
night, O
but O
if O
I O
read O
the O
other O
reviews O
like O
this, O
it's O
a O
lot O
safer O
to O
book. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
straightforward, O
and O
that's O
really O
a O
lot O
more O
pleasurable O
than O
being O
over-chequered O
and O
over-forced. O

All O
night O
long, O
we O
were O
also O
asked O
explicitly O
if O
everything O
was O
as O
we O
wanted, O
without O
having O
to O
worry O
too O
much O
about O
the O
operator. B-TARGET

Also, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
creates O
a O
relaxing O
evening. O

We O
chose O
the O
vegetarian B-TARGET
four-course I-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
definitely O
worth O
it. O

The O
amusement O
was O
olive B-TARGET
oil, O
and O
it O
was O
really, O
really O
delicious. O

And O
then O
we'd O
already O
had O
some O
olive O
oil O
bread, O
which O
was O
within O
five O
minutes. O

It's O
always O
fun O
when O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
wait O
very O
long. O

The O
two O
appetizers B-TARGET
were O
delicious O
too, O
but O
especially O
the O
hearty O
appetizer, B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
beef, I-TARGET
stayed O
with O
me. O

This O
one O
was O
served O
with O
beans, O
and O
it's O
a O
very O
original O
vegetarian O
version O
of O
the O
classic O
Spanish O
salad O
with O
beans. O

For O
the O
main O
course, O
the O
vegan B-TARGET
latte, I-TARGET
again, O
it's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
"we O
just O
throw O
the O
meat O
away." O

This O
was O
really O
a O
delicious O
dish, B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
finished O
with O
a O
pesto B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
basil, I-TARGET
which O
was O
delicious O
enough O
to O
eat O
on O
its O
own. O

As O
a O
dessert, O
I O
chose O
the O
vegan B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
mousse, I-TARGET
and O
although O
this O
is O
actually O
something O
very O
different O
than O
what O
you O
might O
expect, O
and O
we O
were O
very O
wary O
of O
that O
before, O
it's O
really O
a O
recommendation. O

It's O
really O
pure O
chocolate, B-TARGET
which O
goes O
great O
with O
the O
orange O
juice O
that's O
served. O

In O
short, O
if O
you O
come O
out O
here, O
you've O
really O
eaten O
for O
your O
money. O

The O
generous O
portions, B-TARGET
the O
hospitality, B-TARGET
and O
the O
chef B-TARGET
who's O
clearly O
below O
the O
table O
cooking O
without O
meat O
or O
fish, O
are O
priceless. O

We'll O
come O
back O
here O
anyway, O
maybe O
test O
the O
beautiful O
courtyard. B-TARGET

never O
again!!!!!, O
my O
animals O
get O
better O
food!!!!, O
only O
the O
money O
counts O
stay O
away O
and O
go O
somewhere O
where O
it's O
definitely O
much O
better O
not O
price/quality!!!! O

that O
something B-TARGET
like O
this O
can O
still O
be O
open O
in O
our O
beautiful O
city, O
I O
don't O
understand. O

As O
a O
bridge, O
it's O
a O
shame O
to O
drink O
there. O

40 O
cents O
of O
Coke, B-TARGET
5.80 O
cents O
for O
the O
bridge, O
three O
cents, O
happily. O

Juicer's B-TARGET
price: O
$25.50; O
White B-TARGET
wine: I-TARGET
$7.00; O
Coffee: B-TARGET
$2.50, O
and O
this O
can O
be O
more O
or O
less O
snuff-y. O

And O
hopefully O
they O
won't O
tell O
people O
to O
eat O
from O
it O
because O
it's O
forbidden O
in O
Bruges. O

We're O
going O
to O
be O
monitoring O
this. O

a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
fun O
or O
a O
bit O
of O
luxury. O

very O
delicious! O

on O
the O
map B-TARGET
to O
get O
different O
Italian O
dishes O
or O
different O
kinds O
of O
salads O
as O
well!! O

definitely O
a O
recommendation! O

Very O
nice O
staff, B-TARGET
lots O
and O
lots O
of O
delicious O
meat, B-TARGET
saucers, B-TARGET
fries B-TARGET
and O
vegetables B-TARGET
a O
volunteer. O

A O
real O
recommendation. O

Discovering. O

Even O
for O
culinary O
purposes, O
people O
like O
us O
are. O

And O
kids O
are O
welcome. O

That O
combination O
is O
what O
gives O
us O
a O
six-inch O
double O
helix. O

say O
I O
said O
it!!!! O

The O
soup B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
was O
solid O
from O
the O
salt. O

A O
bottle O
of O
hot O
water O
was O
offered O
as O
a O
solution. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
a O
bowl O
of O
broccoli O
was O
all O
the O
vegetables. B-TARGET

When O
I O
cleaned O
up, O
my O
clothes O
were O
lined O
with O
sausages. O

No O
fair O
excuses O
offered, O
no O
small O
compensation O
offered. O

Go O
around O
it O
with O
a O
big O
bow. O

Never O
before O
in O
a O
dirty, O
unorganized O
McDonald's B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
have O
I O
been O
a O
sucker. O

They O
should O
have O
closed O
this O
case. B-TARGET

We O
were O
going O
to O
fast-forward, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
really O
long O
for O
five O
hamburgers: O
15 O
to O
20 O
minutes. O

For O
the O
rest, O
what O
we O
noticed O
was O
that O
the O
whole O
pricing B-TARGET
chart, I-TARGET
like O
the O
Euro O
deals, O
wasn't O
quite O
clear. O

It's O
a O
very O
fat, O
dirty O
thing. B-TARGET
The O
ad O
for O
1.3 O
kilos O
is O
600 O
grams, O
everything's O
bad. O

I've O
noticed O
over O
and O
over O
again O
that O
the O
black-haired B-TARGET
lesbian I-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
is O
"accidentally" O
returning O
too O
little O
money. O

And O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
table, O
I O
also O
heard O
people O
complaining O
that O
they'd O
been O
deducted O
10 O
euros. O

This O
is O
no O
longer O
an O
accident. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
nostalgia O
in O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
there's O
lots O
of O
carrot O
stamps O
on O
the O
menu. O

Menu B-TARGET
at O
an O
attractive O
price. O

Many O
stairs O
are O
not O
very O
handy O
for O
people O
with O
locomotor O
problems. O

Very O
nice O
people. B-TARGET

Since O
we O
got O
a O
second O
house O
in O
Knokke, O
I've O
been O
looking O
really, O
really O
hard O
for O
a O
nice O
lunch O
restaurant/brewery. O

The B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
looked O
good, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
were O
neatly O
covered. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
too O
expensive O
for O
what O
was O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
chicken B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
bacon B-TARGET
could O
have O
been O
a O
better O
mix, O
and O
I O
just O
didn't O
like O
the O
fries. B-TARGET

It O
took O
a O
very O
long O
time O
to O
calculate O
when O
there O
was O
no O
press O
in O
the O
case. O

So O
go O
looking O
for O
a O
lunchbox. O

friendly O
remarks, B-TARGET
press O
this O
Saturday O
night. O

Menu B-TARGET
at O
a O
very O
affordable O
price. O

Garbage B-TARGET
crumbs I-TARGET
made O
at O
home. O

Half O
of O
it O
is B-TARGET
shriveled I-TARGET
up O
to O
a O
minimum. O

Rapid O
operation. B-TARGET

We O
got O
what O
we O
expected, O
but O
we O
didn't O
get O
it O
anymore. O

The O
lunch B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
in O
price O
quality. O

Good O
choice B-TARGET
and O
big O
portions. B-TARGET

Garlic B-TARGET
crockery I-TARGET
where O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
look O
for O
the O
garlic. O

Friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
olives B-TARGET
at O
the O
aperture. O

In O
short, O
it's O
really O
worth O
recommending O
and O
repeating. O

At O
the O
fireworks O
festival O
in O
Knokke, O
it's O
always O
busy. O

And O
the O
Lodge's O
courtyard O
is O
also O
well-filled. O

When O
we O
find O
a O
place, O
we're O
instantly O
recognized O
as O
being O
successful O
by O
our O
neighbors O
at O
the O
table. O

When O
we O
called O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
he'd O
come O
pick O
up O
our O
order, O
but O
when O
it O
turned O
out O
we O
were O
new O
clients, O
he O
canceled O
the O
recorded O
order O
and O
told O
us O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
serve O
his O
existing O
clients O
first, O
before O
he O
served O
us. O

When O
we O
called O
in O
a O
second O
waitress, B-TARGET
we O
were O
even O
less O
successful O
because O
she O
didn't O
know O
Dutch, O
and O
she O
walked O
in O
for O
bacon O
and O
beans. O

After O
being O
patient O
for O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
and O
seeing O
the O
pressure O
of O
the O
night, O
and O
seeing O
the O
mostly O
under-represented O
staff O
and O
all O
the O
four O
tables O
go O
away, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
comes O
to O
clean O
up O
our O
overcrowded O
table, O
and O
we O
do O
a O
third O
attempt O
to O
order, O
and O
the O
waiter, O
after O
being O
patient O
for O
30 O
minutes, O
begs O
us O
to O
wait O
another O
15 O
minutes. O

He'd O
rather O
play O
the O
kitchen O
bitch, O
where O
he O
first O
wants O
to O
chop O
down O
all O
his O
tables, O
and O
then O
in O
five O
minutes O
he's O
going O
to O
pick O
up O
all O
the O
orders O
for O
food O
and O
drink O
from O
15 O
new O
tables. O

And O
it's O
great O
for O
the O
chef, O
and O
it's O
great O
for O
himself, O
to O
be O
able O
to O
serve O
15 O
dishes O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
15 O
tables O
full O
of O
drinks O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
15 O
tables O
empty O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

And O
since O
we've O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
patience, O
we O
had O
hoped O
for O
a O
prize O
of O
"boiling O
points," O
but O
unfortunately O
we O
didn't. O

And O
as O
we O
walked O
down O
the O
bank, O
we O
stopped O
at O
the O
next O
restaurant, O
Waterl'eau, O
where O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
take O
a O
seat O
if O
we O
were O
going O
to O
have O
anything O
to O
eat, O
given O
the O
crowd O
that O
night. O

We O
were O
promptly O
served O
our O
aperitif, O
were O
kindly O
served, O
and O
were O
quickly O
served O
our O
food. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later, O
we O
saw O
half O
of O
the O
lodge O
grounds O
on O
our O
terrace O
nest O
at O
Waterl'eau. O

The B-TARGET
lodge I-TARGET
there, O
I'll O
never O
go O
again. O

Despite O
the O
age O
of O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
you O
should O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
he's O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
experience, O
but O
I O
wouldn't O
want O
to O
have O
a O
billboard O
like O
that O
in O
my O
case. O

What's O
more, O
it O
should O
also O
be O
recognized O
that O
a O
single O
waiter O
for O
a O
terrace O
like O
this O
is O
unfeasible. O

If O
I O
have O
to O
wait O
40 O
minutes O
for O
a O
drink O
or O
a O
meal, O
I O
don't O
think O
that's O
normal. O

After O
a O
bicycle O
ride O
in O
the O
Westhoek, O
having O
a O
nice O
meal O
at O
Capella. O

A O
little O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
crowdedness O
of O
the O
Great O
Market. O

At O
our O
request, O
a O
table O
was O
set O
up O
on O
the O
ground O
floor. O

A O
surprisingly O
delicious O
snack B-TARGET
with O
an O
aperitif O
and O
a O
delicious O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
scampi. I-TARGET

Repetitive. O

We've O
had O
prime O
food O
here, O
great O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
very O
good O
price-quality O
ratio. O

Reserved O
for O
the O
second O
time O
this O
year O
in O
this O
super O
restaurant. B-TARGET

This O
time O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends. O

And O
as O
usual, O
it's O
here O
to O
enjoy O
delicious O
combinations B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
flavors I-TARGET
and O
delicious B-TARGET
cocktails. I-TARGET

And O
again O
and O
again, O
we're O
surprised O
by O
the O
extraordinarily O
sophisticated O
kitchen. B-TARGET

a O
nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
lots O
of O
noise, O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
at O
the O
best O
price. O

It's O
just O
a O
little O
bit, O
and O
sometimes O
it's O
noisy O
when O
there's O
a O
big O
group O
at O
a O
table. O

but O
yeah, O
that's O
a O
student O
bag, O
and O
you O
take O
that O
with O
you. O

What O
seemed O
like O
fun O
at O
first O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
an O
amazingly O
bad O
experience. O

Mosquitos O
for O
15 O
euros? O

Forget O
it! O

You O
can't O
get O
them O
for O
under O
$20. O

We O
were O
guided O
in O
by O
a O
man B-TARGET
who O
was O
quite O
a O
bit O
bossy O
and O
barked O
at O
us O
with O
his O
finger O
to O
take O
us O
into O
the O
full O
part O
of O
the O
restoration. O

I O
really O
didn't O
like O
that O
guy. B-TARGET

Looking O
around O
the O
room, O
I O
decided O
not O
to O
eat O
mosquitos O
and O
not O
to O
eat O
steak. O

I O
didn't O
immediately O
believe O
the O
story. B-TARGET

I O
chose O
a O
spaghetti O
sauce O
and O
a O
grapefruit B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
that O
tasted O
like O
sugar. O

I O
don't O
know O
what O
I O
ate, O
but O
it O
didn't O
look O
good O
to O
me. O

The O
blow O
to O
the O
arrow O
came O
when O
I O
wanted O
to O
calculate O
with O
a O
stopwatch O
or O
a O
visa. O

The O
boss O
said O
that O
was O
not O
possible. O

It O
had O
to O
be O
cash. O

Yeah, O
there O
you O
go, O
I O
thought. O

First-class O
entrepreneurs. O

So O
I O
left O
my O
wife O
and O
child O
behind O
to O
walk O
500 O
meters O
to O
collect O
cash. O

And O
when O
I O
pointed O
out O
to O
the O
owner B-TARGET
that O
these O
are O
very O
dirty O
practices, O
she O
made O
a O
scene O
and O
refused O
to O
give O
me O
cash. O

I O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
to O
get O
sick O
that O
night. O

I O
repeatedly O
asked O
my O
wife, O
"What O
have O
I O
actually O
eaten? O

I'd O
love O
to O
know!" O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
a O
smokestack. O

They O
just O
have O
to O
close O
those O
places B-TARGET
immediately. O

Nothing O
good. O

Horrible! O

This O
was O
my O
biggest O
take-away B-TARGET
counterintuitive O
ever. O

We O
were O
staying O
in O
Sunparks, O
and O
we O
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
pizza O
in O
Newport. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
dough I-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
the O
bounty B-TARGET
and O
certainly O
the O
price O
was O
counterproductive. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
very O
badly O
filled, O
and O
the O
flavor O
was O
very O
poor. O

I O
also O
used O
to O
pay O
the O
restaurant O
bills O
when O
pick-up B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
was O
cheaper O
in O
the O
folder. O

I O
hadn't O
seen O
this O
before O
when O
I O
arrived O
at O
the O
Sunparks O
little O
house. O

This O
was, O
to O
me, O
the O
biggest O
contradiction O
ever, O
and O
I'm O
certainly O
not O
going O
to O
go O
back O
to O
this. O

had O
ordered O
a O
brunch, O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, B-TARGET
enough O
to O
drink, O

other O
people O
were O
eating O
exactly O
what O
we O
were O
eating. B-TARGET

The O
old O
cafeteria O
was O
cosy O
and O
honest. O

Now O
it's O
a O
characterless O
refinery. O

At O
3:30 O
p.m., O
the O
chairs O
at O
the O
bottom O
are O
put O
on O
top O
of O
the O
table. O

It's O
a O
sign O
that O
you O
can O
go O
away O
silently. O

A O
half-and-a-half B-TARGET
is O
just O
one-third O
of O
the O
pile O
filled O
with O
a O
trapezoid O
out O
of O
the O
barrel. O

And O
it's O
way O
too O
expensive O
here. O

Sadly, O
this O
has O
evolved O
so O
much, O

I O
can't O
tell O
you O
much O
about O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
the O
lentils B-TARGET
are O
relatively O
expensive. O

We're O
more O
than O
happy O
about O
our O
evening O
at O
the O
Gempemolen. B-TARGET

We O
were O
warmly O
welcomed O
and O
treated O
all O
night O
long. O

After O
the O
soup, O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
for O
the O
swine B-TARGET
soup, O
which O
was O
delicious O
and O
full O
of O
all O
kinds O
of O
delicious O
vegetables. B-TARGET

One O
person O
chose O
a O
vegetarian B-TARGET
bowl, I-TARGET
and O
she O
too O
was O
very O
enthusiastic. O

We O
had O
all O
the O
time O
to O
sit O
down O
and O
eat, O
and O
we O
really O
enjoyed O
it. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
the O
guy O
on O
the O
cake. O

Price/quality O
a O
big O
recommendation!!! O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
Brasserie B-TARGET
is O
being O
hollowed O
out O
by O
the O
Meus O
Clan, O
it's O
not O
keeping O
up O
with O
expectations. O

Environment B-TARGET
and O
interior B-TARGET
are O
more O
than O
fine, O
food B-TARGET
is O
less O
enthusiastic. O

Sorry. O

You'll O
find O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
lots O
of O
skill O
and O
enthusiasm O
cooked O
and O
served O
with O
style. O

Becoming O
a O
Michelin O
star O
hasn't O
rocketed O
Love B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Iris. I-TARGET

The O
prices O
are O
always O
right, O
and O
they've O
even O
remained O
very O
depressing. O

In O
short, O
everybody O
out O
there! O

Even O
though O
we O
didn't O
book, O
we O
got O
a O
table O
on O
a O
busy O
night. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
served O
at O
an O
acceptable O
time, O
and O
everything O
was O
according O
to O
expectations. O

Maybe O
decide O
to O
serve O
a O
little O
less O
louder O
fries. B-TARGET
(Laughter) O

For O
the O
rest, O
it O
was O
all O
about O
wishful O
thinking. O

We O
got O
a O
super-lighter O
scooter B-TARGET
launched O
in O
no O
time. O

It O
was O
all O
fresh O
and O
certainly O
sufficient. O

The O
operator B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly. O

When O
you O
come O
in, O
you O
don't O
get O
very O
welcoming. O

It O
was O
pretty O
crowded. O

owner B-TARGET
was O
incredibly O
anti-traffic O
on O
his O
staff. O

and O
we O
left O
with O
his O
wife O
immediately. O

Due O
to O
circumstances, O
I've O
been O
here O
three O
times O
with O
various O
friends O
in O
the O
last O
couple O
of O
weeks, O
and O
I've O
been O
able O
to O
taste O
both O
an O
outside O
lunch, O
a O
la O
carte O
and O
a O
menu. O

Everybody O
agreed O
that O
Le B-TARGET
Kok I-TARGET
is O
really O
a O
remarkable O
asset O
in O
the O
De O
Haan O
area. O

The O
chef B-TARGET
has O
clearly O
found O
a O
silver O
lining O
to O
not O
only O
deliver O
the O
beautiful O
presentations, O
but O
to O
teach O
the O
delicious O
dishes. O

Really O
very O
sophisticated O
in O
all O
sorts O
of O
ways. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
quiet. O

Although O
it's O
not O
listed, O
you O
can O
park O
at O
the O
adjacent O
plant O
and O
garden O
company. O

The O
price-quality O
ratio O
is O
good. O

Very O
professional O
host B-TARGET
woman I-TARGET
and O
good O
service, B-TARGET
although O
once O
the O
principle O
of O
first-in, O
first-served O
was O
not O
applied, O
probably O
it O
was O
pushed O
by O
the O
press. O

And O
unfortunately, O
here O
too, O
the O
more O
common O
rule O
is O
money, O
which O
is O
with O
four O
or O
all O
at O
a O
time, O
or O
all O
menu O
choices. O

But O
this O
won't O
stop O
me O
from O
coming O
back, O
for O
sure. O

And O
we O
ate O
really O
good O
food O
here. O

restaurant B-TARGET
with O
open O
kitchen O
and O
quiet O
frame. O

I'm O
sure O
you'll O
come O
back O
here. O

Chicken O
with O
fries B-TARGET
ordered, O
fries O
eaten O
all O
night O
long O
and O
fat, O
no O
cheese B-TARGET
because O
the O
chef B-TARGET
was O
mean, O
chicken O
with O
broccoli, O
my O
husband O
was O
still O
good! O

after O
another O
rage, O
we O
threw O
some O
dressing O
in, O
and O
then O
we O
came O
back, O
and O
we O
asked O
for O
mayo, B-TARGET
and O
we O
threw O
mayo O
with O
broccoli O
and O
condition, O
and O
then O
again, O
my O
husband O
says, O
jammy O
customer O
is O
still O
king, O
unchallenged, O
and O
the O
chef's B-TARGET
answer, O
jammy, O
I'm O
king! O

then O
he O
kept O
screaming! O

and O
the O
guy O
says, O
"If O
that's O
the O
way O
it O
is, O
we're O
just O
going O
away!" O

man O
comes O
out, O
I O
say O
good, O
come O
on, O
the O
kids O
are O
hungry, O
just O
eat, O
come O
on, O
one B-TARGET
outer O
hood, O
now O
eat! O

now, O
please! O

Eight O
euros! O

man, O
we're O
still O
at O
work! O

that O
starts O
throwing O
dust!!!!! O

man O
pays O
and O
garcon B-TARGET
takes O
all O
the O
food O
away!!!!! O

and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden, O
all O
the O
managers, O
bosses O
and O
chefs, O
they're O
all O
over O
us!!! O

boss B-TARGET
with O
a O
baseball O
tap O
next O
to O
me!!!!!!!!!! O

I O
lost O
80€, O
went O
to O
bed O
at O
night O
and O
was O
fed O
by O
my O
parents O
and O
kids. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
couldn't O
have O
been O
better! O

And O
maybe O
for O
a O
minute, O
the O
lady B-TARGET
just O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
a O
coffee O
-- O
although O
we O
were O
four O
of O
us O
-- O
and O
also O
asked O
the O
other O
people O
at O
the O
table, O
and O
she O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
away O
-- O
so O
everybody O
had O
a O
coffee. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
have O
to O
behave O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
quietly. O

Another O
top! O

It's O
a O
lovely, O
cosy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Food B-TARGET
was O
perfect, O
nothing O
to O
notice. O

Very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
handcuffed. O

We're O
definitely O
going O
back. O

We O
were O
greeted O
with O
hospitality, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
steeply O
located. O

And O
at O
the O
aperitif, O
there O
was O
a O
whole O
series O
of O
wonderful, O
delicious O
snacks. B-TARGET

The O
menu B-TARGET
itself O
was O
the O
same O
level, O
without O
a O
single O
minus. O

My O
wife O
asked O
for O
modified B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
in O
small O
quantities, O
which O
they O
served O
spontaneously, O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
they O
got O
a O
very O
correct O
price O
for O
the O
raisins. O

Chapeau O
for O
everything! O

Have O
a O
great O
night O
at O
The B-TARGET
Bistronomy. I-TARGET

Wonderful O
combinations B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
flavors I-TARGET
beautifully O
presented O
on O
the O
perfect O
board. O

Looking O
for O
a O
unique, O
total O
experience? O

This B-TARGET
is O
THE O
place O
to O
be! O

Our O
company O
was O
introduced O
to O
the O
robotic B-TARGET
hostess' I-TARGET
surprising O
tricks O
we've O
never O
seen O
before. O

This O
is O
my O
second O
assessment. O

This O
time O
it's O
horrific. O

We're O
sitting O
there O
from O
19:30, O
and O
at O
22 O
o'clock, O
they O
come O
in O
and O
they O
say O
she's O
forgotten O
your O
order. O

So O
after O
all O
these O
negative O
reviews, O

Leave O
it O
on O
the O
left. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
was O
always O
giving O
three-digit O
A's. O

But O
there's O
no O
manager. O

To O
summarize O
very O
briefly: O
unmanned, O
unprofessional O
operators B-TARGET
and O
very O
poor O
food B-TARGET
-- O
next O
day O
ill. O

We O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
look O
at O
the O
Chi-Chis O
-- O
read O
on. O

To O
summarize O
very O
briefly: O
unmanned, O
unprofessional O
operators B-TARGET
and O
very O
poor O
food B-TARGET
-- O
next O
day O
ill. O

We O
went O
more O
often O
to O
see O
the O
Chi-Chis O
in O
other O
towns, O
and O
we O
were O
generally O
satisfied. O

Chi-Chi's B-TARGET
Wemmel I-TARGET
recently O
opened O
his O
doors, O
perhaps O
because O
the O
quality O
is O
so O
low. O

Tip O
the O
retailer: O
train O
staff B-TARGET
(both O
in O
the O
kitchen O
and O
in O
the O
room) O
if O
you O
want O
to O
keep O
the O
deal O
open. O

It's O
so O
sad O
to O
eat O
there! O

We O
were O
there O
with O
a O
Flair O
Bottle. O

We O
got O
there, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
about O
five O
minutes O
before O
there O
was O
anybody O
else O
in O
the O
room. O

We O
had O
reservations, O
so O
we O
wanted O
to O
know O
where O
we O
could O
sit. O

In O
the O
end, O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
choose, O
and O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
only O
table O
that O
didn't O
have O
dirty O
tiles O
on O
it O
and O
where O
the O
tables O
were O
tiled. O

And O
we O
found O
this O
quite O
unpleasant. O

Then O
we O
could O
wait O
another O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
for O
the O
cards O
to O
be O
brought O
in. O

Then O
another O
20 O
minutes O
before O
the O
staff B-TARGET
had O
finished O
talking O
and O
had O
time O
to O
take O
our O
order. O

We'd O
gone O
to O
the O
buffet, O
and O
we'd O
had O
an O
alcohol-free O
cocktail. O

We O
got O
the O
cocktail O
when O
we O
were O
almost O
done O
with O
our O
meals O
-- O
and O
we're O
not O
fast O
food O
people, O
by O
the O
way. O

The O
buffet B-TARGET
was O
sick. O

Choose O
from O
five O
hot O
dishes O
and O
a O
sixteen O
cold O
dishes. O

Almost O
everything O
was O
on, O
and O
what O
was O
left O
was O
dried O
up, O
baked, O
or O
even O
cold. O

And O
after O
we O
had O
emptied O
our O
first O
board, O
we O
wanted O
to O
do O
it O
again. O

This O
couldn't O
be O
because O
everything O
was O
on. O

And O
we O
couldn't O
take O
much O
for O
the O
first O
time O
because O
there O
wasn't O
a O
lot. O

My O
friend O
went O
over O
and O
over O
again O
in O
Dutch O
to O
ask O
me O
when O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
filled O
in, O
only O
to O
be O
told O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
didn't O
speak O
Dutch. O

And O
then O
they O
tried O
it O
in O
French, O
and O
then O
they O
went, O
"Let's O
see O
if O
we O
can O
fill O
it O
in." O

We O
were O
waiting O
for O
over O
half O
an O
hour, O
exhausted, O
and O
we O
left O
in O
excruciating O
starvation. O

Furthermore, O
we've O
both O
been O
sick O
for O
three O
days O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
obviously O
isn't O
kept O
to O
a O
hygienic O
temperature O
in O
the O
buffet. O

Also O
very O
unhappy O
about O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
girl B-TARGET
who O
walked O
past O
our O
table O
-- O
and O
sometimes O
she O
wouldn't O
even O
touch O
it O
-- O
because O
she O
didn't O
want O
to O
speak O
Dutch. O

And O
this O
while O
there O
were O
dirty O
signs O
all O
over O
the O
place O
and O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time. O

Moreover, O
the O
napkins B-TARGET
on O
our O
table O
had O
already O
been O
used O
and O
just O
been O
folded O
back O
up, O
and O
the O
cards B-TARGET
were O
very O
sticky. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
and O
the O
last O
time. O

Very O
nice, O
perfect O
operation, B-TARGET
very O
sophisticated O
dishes! B-TARGET

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly. O

We're O
certainly O
going O
back. O

Person O
X O
out O
of O
Y. O

Today O
it's O
a O
birthday O
party. O

So O
we O
had O
a O
nice O
dinner O
together. O

and O
then O
enjoy O
it, O
we O
thought. O

18 O
o'clock O
at O
the O
table. O

After O
we O
had O
found O
the O
menus O
ourselves, O
at O
half O
past O
seven, O
we O
just O
asked O
if O
we O
could O
order O
them. O

Ten O
minutes O
later, O
another O
question O
was O
asked. O

The O
lunch B-TARGET
was O
fine. O

At O
the O
main O
course, O
they O
had O
another O
three-quarters O
of O
an O
hour O
to O
wait O
after O
repeated O
queries. O

Small O
portions, B-TARGET
half-meat, B-TARGET
in O
short, O
useless. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
melts, O
the O
fries B-TARGET
come O
out O
of O
the O
fridge. O

The O
operator B-TARGET
is O
unfriendly, O
always O
starts O
to O
discuss O
with O
the O
guests. O

My O
second O
liver B-TARGET
came O
out O
of O
the O
drawer O
in O
a O
bottle! O

In O
short, O
it's O
really O
worthless. O

Never O
again. O

we O
were O
with O
a O
broad O
group, O
but O
the O
different O
choices O
of O
the O
participants O
had O
been O
made O
in O
advance. O

the O
paper O
dough O
from O
the O
queen's O
lunch O
was O
top O
the O
rest B-TARGET
wasn't O
for O
writing O
home O
prefabricated O
ham O
balls, O
no O
sauce, O
no O
mushrooms O
to O
eat, O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
chicken O
the O
fries O
were O
below O
the O
curve, O
unctuous O
cardboard, O
there's O
plenty O
of O
other O
possibilities O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
especially O
if O
you're O
with O
a O
small O
group, O
and O
if O
you're O
with O
larger O
groups, O
there's O
got O
to O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
within O
Maaseik. O

Nice O
quiet O
setting, B-TARGET
beautiful O
buffet, B-TARGET
waiting I-TARGET
service, I-TARGET
but O
especially O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

With O
the O
five O
corridors, O
I'd O
have O
more O
than O
enough, O
and O
I'd O
have O
more O
than O
enough, O
but O
anyway, O
we O
went O
to O
the O
seventh O
one O
with O
adapted O
wines. O
