Long O
waiting B-TARGET
time. I-TARGET

Same O
dessert B-TARGET
for O
two O
days. O

Breakfast B-TARGET
was O
tip O
top. O

Not O
very O
cheap! O

Via O
via O
we O
had O
heard O
that O
we O
had O
to O
be O
here O
for O
Wagye O
runder O
meat. O

Our O
GPS O
was O
not O
the O
best O
guide O
to O
get O
to O
Castle O
Altembrouck. O

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
it O
was O
a O
party. O

First O
of O
all O
the O
service, B-TARGET
exceptionally O
friendly O
attention O
not O
forced O
but O
genuine. O

Rarely O
experienced, O
there O
was O
a O
delicious O
chemistry O
among O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

You O
can O
choose O
between O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
menus. B-TARGET

Specialization O
are O
the O
Wagye O
cattle. O

If O
you O
ask O
for O
an O
explanation O
about O
this O
delicious O
beef, B-TARGET
the O
meat O
will O
be O
presented O
to O
you O
in O
advance O
on O
a O
plate. O

It O
is O
not O
cheap, O
but O
exceptionally O
delicious. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
a O
steak O
lover O
there O
is O
a O
fish, O
duck B-TARGET
and O
lamb I-TARGET
alternative I-TARGET
at O
acceptable O
prices. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
is O
a O
good O
selection O
of O
delicious O
quality O
wines. B-TARGET

It’s O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
we O
ate O
so O
well. O

On O
the O
border O
between O
the O
Netherlands O
and O
Belgium O
we O
ate O
exceptionally O
delicious O
in O
an O
atmospheric O
environment B-TARGET
with O
a O
live O
band O
that O
found O
the O
right O
tone O
and O
provided O
us O
with O
a O
delicious O
afternoon. O

This O
is O
the O
third O
time O
we O
eat O
here. O

It O
is O
a O
fantastic O
opportunity. B-TARGET

In O
good O
weather O
outside O
in O
the O
courtyard O
or O
at O
the O
pond O
something O
to O
eat O
or O
drink. O

At O
the O
Altembrouck O
estate, O
people O
work O
with O
fresh, O
honest O
products. B-TARGET

For O
example, O
they O
have O
majalica O
(curly O
hair) O
pigs O
and O
wagyu O
cattle. O

There O
is O
no O
menu. B-TARGET

On O
Sundays O
there O
is O
a O
3-way B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
for O
27.50 O
which O
is O
real O
price O
quality. O

The O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
menu B-TARGET
even O
no O
daily. O

If O
the O
host O
has O
listed O
what O
is O
there O
to O
eat, O
before O
he O
or O
she O
has O
lost O
to O
the O
dessert O
what O
is O
the O
main O
dish. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
correct O
without O
being O
stiff. O

Only O
a O
pity O
the O
last O
time O
that O
both O
pork O
and O
beef O
were O
mentioned O
as O
the O
main O
dish O
and O
our O
entire O
table O
found O
it O
strange O
not O
to O
be O
asked O
what O
our O
preference O
was. O

It O
was O
that O
the O
cattle O
had O
already O
been O
sold O
out. O

Furthermore, O
and O
very O
flexible O
3 O
press O
would O
like O
to O
(with O
additional O
payment) O
go O
for O
the O
prelude O
of O
the O
Easter O
menu. O

It O
all O
went. O

Nevertheless, O
it O
would O
be O
advisable O
to O
put O
at O
least O
something O
like O
a O
Easter O
menu O
on O
the O
website. O

Now O
you O
have O
to O
call O
or O
email O
for O
it, O
which O
is O
not O
very O
commercial. O

Nothing O
but O
praise. O

So O
deliciously O
imaginatively O
served O
food B-TARGET
in O
a O
nice O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

I O
can O
only O
recommend O
this. O

Come O
here O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
or O
a O
salad... O
also O
fine. O

Just O
do O
it O
once O
and O
be O
surprised. O

Unfortunately, O
such O
a O
thing, B-TARGET
beautifully O
located, O
good O
cuisine, B-TARGET
but O
the O
kindness O
of O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
shame O
and O
unprofessional, O

We O
had O
a O
Swiss O
guest O
at O
home. O

He O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
tour O
he O
received O
in O
Halle. O

For O
all O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
Cardijn O
spent O
his O
youth O
in O
Halle, O
the O
beautiful O
St O
Martin O
Basilicas. O

He O
knew O
the O
music O
of O
Servais O
but O
did O
not O
know O
that O
it O
still O
smelled O
of O
Servais. O

The O
idea O
of O
concluding O
this O
beautiful O
evening O
with O
a O
dinner O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
"'t B-TARGET
Groot I-TARGET
Café I-TARGET
" O
was O
a O
real O
reminder O
of O
your O
welsh. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
fired. O

So O
unfriendly O
on O
the O
farm. O

Apparently O
he O
still O
works O
there. O
more O
sympathetic O
he O
has O
not O
become O
to O
it. O

The O
food B-TARGET
did O
not O
really O
play O
a O
role O
here O
or O
the O
service B-TARGET
played O
a O
role O
here. O

As O
long O
as O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
worked O
there, O
I O
did O
not O
see O
him O
again. O

We O
ate O
with O
nine O
people. O

What O
a O
terrible O
experience. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
ungrateful O
and O
did O
everything O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
he O
didn’t O
want O
to O
serve O
us. O

When O
we O
said, O
yes, O
if O
it O
is O
too O
difficult O
to O
serve O
us, O
we O
could O
not O
finish O
our O
sentence O
but O
were O
screamed O
by O
the O
ear O
of O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
then O
turned O
and O
went O
away. O

The O
other O
customers O
said O
out O
loud O
that O
it O
was O
scandalous O
and O
unbelievable O
that O
a O
group O
of O
9 O
people O
were O
so O
clearly O
out! O

Any O
other O
restaurant O
with O
some O
dignity O
would O
welcome O
9 O
customers O
at O
19.20am O
on O
Saturday O
night O
with O
open O
arms! O

If O
this O
issue B-TARGET
can’t O
keep O
the O
head O
above O
water, O
it’s O
not O
the O
crisis! O

Owners, O
teach O
your O
staff B-TARGET
ways. O

We O
come O
here O
to O
eat O
more O
often: O
good O
brasserie, B-TARGET
of O
course. O

Everything O
is O
okay, O
but O
you O
never O
get O
a O
real O
'wow' O
feeling. O

The O
case O
is O
clearly O
on O
the O
fixed O
(older) O
client’s O
part O
and O
is O
satisfied O
with O
this. O

In O
short, O
you O
will O
never O
be O
disappointed, O
but O
you O
will O
also O
never O
be O
in O
the O
clouds. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
gave O
us O
the O
free O
choice O
of O
tapas B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
she O
delivered O
quickly O
and O
although O
everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
good O
quality, O
I O
missed O
refinement. O

We O
told O
at O
the O
beginning O
to O
keep O
the O
combination O
of O
tapa O
and O
fish O
and O
this O
was O
not O
at O
all O
taken O
into O
consideration: O
iberico, B-TARGET
chorizo, B-TARGET
manchego, B-TARGET
Russian B-TARGET
egg, I-TARGET
mushrooms, B-TARGET
tomatoes...., B-TARGET
cracked B-TARGET
balls I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
all O
delicious, O
but O
not O
authentic... O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
most O
expensive O
bottle O
still O
at O
a O
modest O
price O
of O
30 O
euros. O

So O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
address B-TARGET
for O
cozy O
babble O
and O
simple O
but O
delicious O
tapàs B-TARGET

Friendly O
but O
hasty O
service. B-TARGET

The O
Southern O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Funny O
and O
delicious. O

Great O
idea B-TARGET
for O
a O
great O
evening O
in O
Spanish O
decor!! O

Will O
surely O
come O
back O

Great O
wines B-TARGET
and O
very O
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Authentic O
recipes B-TARGET
(as O
Spanish O
experts O
we O
can O
confirm O
that) O
and O
everything O
homemade O
(that O
you O
taste!). O

Recommended O
for O
a O
night O
out! O

Nice O
concept, B-TARGET
very O
delicious O
wines B-TARGET
and O
tapas, B-TARGET
these O
regularly O
exchange O
sometimes O
very O
good O
other O
just O
good. O

come O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
spend O
a O
pleasant O
evening O
with O
snacks O
and O
drinks, O
the O
service B-TARGET
could O
sometimes O
be O
faster, O
but O
consider O
this O
as O
a O
fun O
and O
relaxing O
afternoon O
or O
evening O
without O
stress O

Antwerp O
metropolis O
is O
a O
fantastic O
city O
for O
gastronomists. O

Also O
in O
the O
periphery O
there O
are O
jewelry O
such O
as O
Klein B-TARGET
Constantia. I-TARGET

Although O
rather O
aimed O
at O
a O
fashionable O
audience O
that O
loves O
to O
eat O
a O
steak, O
this O
restaurant O
with O
the O
regularity O
of O
the O
clock O
presents O
taste O
havens O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
gastronomists. O

And O
for O
lovers O
of O
South O
African O
wines O
with O
a O
fruitful O
taste, O
be O
sure O
to O
try O
Provence O
Rooi. O

The O
best O
restaurant B-TARGET
nearby! O

Passion O
for O
food O
and O
suitable O
drinks O
in O
a O
cozy O
setting. O

Different O
than O
other O
but O
oh O
so O
good!!! O

Previous O
visits O
to O
KC B-TARGET
have O
always O
been O
a O
culinary O
highlight. O

Unfortunately, O
this O
cannot O
be O
said O
of O
the O
last O
visit. O

The O
swing O
is O
apparently O
out. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
chart I-TARGET
is O
much O
too O
limited, O
suggestions B-TARGET
are O
gone, O
just O
like O
the O
creativity O
on O
the O
board. B-TARGET

A O
simple O
salad B-TARGET
as O
a O
side O
dish O
is O
not O
immediately O
my O
motivation O
to O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant. O

Amuses B-TARGET
that O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fun O
entrance O
are O
now O
limited O
to O
a O
pumpkin O
soup. O

But O
even O
with O
this O
limited O
card B-TARGET
(4 O
main O
dishes, O
4 O
prefabrications O
and O
2 O
desserts), O
there O
were O
still O
2 O
dishes O
not O
available! O

But O
very O
annoying, O
this O
was O
not O
in O
advance O
at O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
menu O
map. O

Even O
this O
was O
not O
to O
the O
main O
dish O
until O
the O
time O
it O
was O
to O
be O
served! O

Here O
is O
the O
card O
but O
choose O
something O
else. O

No, O
these O
are O
three O
steps O
backwards O
from O
previous O
visits. O

If O
it O
is O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
owner O
to O
go O
for O
a O
brasserie O
that O
is O
his O
choice, O
but O
as O
now O
bet O
on O
2 O
horses, O
that O
simply O
does O
not O
succeed. O

very O
sorry. O

The O
positive O
remains O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
is O
ok O
and O
the O
wide O
selection O
of O
South B-TARGET
African I-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

Eat O
for O
the O
second O
time. O

Last O
time O
all O
in O
the O
menu, O
this O
time O
all O
in O
the O
menu. O

Tip O
top O
in O
order O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
cava O
with O
waiting O
table, O
preparation, O
main O
dish O
and O
dessert O
or O
Irish O
coffee. O

Water O
and O
2 O
glasses O
of O

included O
for O
32€. O

Very O
friendly O
and O
smooth O
service. B-TARGET

A O
recommended O
one! O

In O
the O
previous O
establishment, O
the O
kitchen O
and O
service O
was O
at O
the O
restaurant O
level. O

Now O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
a O
brasserie O
assessment O
yet. O

With O
family O
(6 O
persons) O
go O
to O
eat O
and O
really O
got O
off. O

A O
delicious O
sandwich B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
atmosphere I-TARGET
was O
ok O

not O

Romance O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work! O

Previously O
at O
the O
Southern O
Pearl O
I O
went O
to O
eat O
regularly, O
now O
the O
concept O
has O
changed O
to O
eating O
coffee O
which O
also O
means O
that O
the O
card O
has O
been O
completely O
adapted. O

But O
to O
be O
honest, O
it O
was O
and O
remains O
top O
here O
to O
eat. O

Beautiful O
clothing O
of O
the O
case, B-TARGET
super O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
for O
everyone O
some O
wils O
on O
the O
map. B-TARGET

What O
I O
personally O
like O
to O
do O
here O
is O
the O
Tapas B-TARGET
dish, I-TARGET
but O
also O
their O
village B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
associated I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
their O
mushrooms B-TARGET
and O
the O
legendary O
Pelt B-TARGET
stove I-TARGET
is O
super O
delicious. O

Also O
the O
pleasure O
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
couch O
or O
hanging O
on O
the O
roof O
and O
enjoying O
a O
delicious O
Cocktail, B-TARGET
it’s O
all O
here. O

Tanja, B-TARGET
you O
are O
doing O
a O
good O
job!! O

We O
wanted O
to O
reserve O
with O
four O
people O
for O
a O
snack O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
former O
Southern O
Pearl O
(phone O
did O
not O
do O
it O
several O
times)!!!! O

Or O
they O
just O
didn’t O
pick O
up. O

We O
went O
over O
to O
action O
and O
yet O
only O
dared O
to O
leave O
hoping O
there O
was O
still O
room!! O

And O
yes O
there O
was O
definitely O
place O
(3 O
hours O
with O
four O
people O
sitting O
in O
the O
case) O
we O
were O
very O
well O
received O
the O
garcon B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
therefore O
the O
only O
responsible O
in O
the O
case! O

The O
thing B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
cool O
because O
there O
was O
no O
people O
to O
go O
away: O
the O
food B-TARGET
just O
scandalous!!!! O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
aldi O
was O
poor O
and O
the O
dressing B-TARGET
was O
already O
exactly O
a O
month O
on O
date! O

The O
homemade B-TARGET
garnal I-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
came O
from O
the O
macro!!!! O

If O
a O
female B-TARGET
employee I-TARGET
was O
just O
smoking O
in O
the O
case B-TARGET
this O
is O
all O
a O
pity O
and O
for O
our O
Workplace O
not O
susceptible O
to O
repetition. O

But O
I O
would O
recommend O
you O
if O
you O
were O
put O
on O
your O
privacy!!! O

Both O
the O
concept B-TARGET
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
are O
organic. O

Bart O
the O
owner O
does O
the O
hall O
and O
1 O
cook O
makes O
the O
dishes. O

Therefore, O
small O
card B-TARGET
with O
only O
super O
fresh O
plates. B-TARGET

The O
wine B-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
is O
fantastic O
and O
price O
quality O
is O
very O
correct. O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
the O
best O
steak B-TARGET
tartare I-TARGET
we’ve O
ever O
eaten O
(the O
baked B-TARGET
ones O
you O
should O
definitely O
try!), O
wine B-TARGET
adapted O
to O
your O
own O
taste,... O

It O
is O
an O
absolute O
recommendation!! O

Great O
restaurant B-TARGET
outside O
the O
real O
centre O
of O
Antwerp. O

Sublime, O
unforced O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
few O
couverts B-TARGET
(reservation O
is O
necessary) O
and O
fantastic O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
top O
(that O
steak B-TARGET
tartar!) I-TARGET
and O
it’s O
nice O
to O
get O
you O
surprised O
by O
their O
wine B-TARGET
selection. I-TARGET

Not O
cheap, O
but O
the O
price/quality O
is O
very O
good. O

An O
absolute O
recommendation! O

Stop O
in O
the O
afternoon O
for O
coffee. O

And O
yes, O
in O
Antwerp’s O
South, O
hip O
is O
not O
always O
equal O
in O
quality. O

The O
coffee B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
choco I-TARGET
were, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
much O
too O
expensive O
and O
served O
too O
cold. O

Lough O
coffee B-TARGET
is O
simply O
unacceptable. O

Especially O
because O
the O
case O
was O
almost O
empty, O
this O
is O
unacceptable. O

It O
also O
does O
not O
give O
a O
good O
impression O
that O
your O
toog O
is O
full O
of O
laundry O
for O
the O
last O
hours O
while O
there O
are O
about O
8 O
people O
in O
the O
case. O

They O
no O
longer O
see O
me O
here. O

The O
portion O
of O
the O
cake B-TARGET
was O
large O
enough O
and O
it O
was O
not O
noticeable. O

Any O
address O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
delicious O
pastrami, B-TARGET
is O
served O
with O
a O
special O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
on O
thick O
cut O
bread. B-TARGET

The O
coffee B-TARGET
is O
also O
good O
and O
there O
is O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Pleasant O
to O
lunch. O

Excellent O
food O
at O
Caffe O
Internazionale. O

After O
checking O
out O
at O
the O
hotel, O
we O
headed O
to O
the O
cozy O
cafe. B-TARGET

We O
had O
an O
extensive O
breakfast O
and O
a O
good O
cup O
of O
coffee. B-TARGET

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
like O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
as O
if O
you O
were O
at O
home O
with O
friends O
o O
visit. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
correct. O

An O
absolute O
recommendation O
for O
a O
delicious O
breakfast, O
breach O
and/or O
coffee! O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
à I-TARGET
L'infintise I-TARGET
is O
a O
unique O
experience O
throughout O
Antwerp. O

For O
an O
affordable O
price, O
the O
chef O
serves O
us O
his O
culinary B-TARGET
creations I-TARGET
where O
his O
personal O
style O
comes O
to O
his O
right. O

Marc B-TARGET
is O
an O
artist O
who O
knows O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
tastes O
and O
appearance O
of O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

You O
fall O
from O
one O
surprise O
to O
another. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is O
very O
original. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
very O
creative, O
delicious, O
I O
have O
no O
words O
for O
it. O

and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

I O
would O
like O
to O
come O
back O
here. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
times I-TARGET
are O
so O
long. O

We O
have O
already O
booked O
for O
December. O

For O
me, O
the O
boss B-TARGET
deserves O
4 O
stars. O

Nice O
furniture, O
plenty O
of O
choice, B-TARGET
good O
price/quality O
ratio. O

We O
arrived O
around O
9 O
p.m. O
so O
there O
were O
very O
few O
people O
there. O

We O
came O
here O
yesterday O
with O
2 O
with O
a O
Grouponbon, O
menu O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
and O
half O
a O
liter O
of O
water. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
warm. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
as O
well. O

Various O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
rice O
separately. O

A O
lot O
of O
vegetables. B-TARGET

Definitely O
enough O
for O
2 O
pers. O
a O
little O
bit: O
a O
little O
chicken B-TARGET
and O
scampi. B-TARGET

The O
snack B-TARGET
was O
somewhat O
tough O
and O
no O
fresh O
chocolate B-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

But O
you O
have O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
the O
price/quality. O

Service B-TARGET
very O
friendly. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
scared O
after O
reading O
other O
comments, O
I O
can O
only O
give O
them O
wrong. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
very O
extensive, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back! O

There O
would O
just O
be O
a O
new B-TARGET
owner, I-TARGET
hence O
the O
positive O
that O
he O
considers. O

We O
wish O
him O
a O
lot O
of O
success! O

It’s O
a O
nice O
little O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
they O
serve O
great O
sushi B-TARGET
but O
that’s O
also O
said. O

Often O
there O
is O
a O
special O
sauce, O
but O
you O
don’t O
get O
it O
here. O

You O
get O
2 O
hours O
to O
order O
your O
5 O
rounds O
but O
within O
those O
2 O
hours O
you O
get O
just O
3 O
rounds O
because O
it O
takes O
so O
terribly O
long. O

About O
30 O
minutes O
from O
ordering. O

In O
addition, O
all O
the O
dirty O
flying O
around O
the O
bar B-TARGET
so O
I’t O
sit O
there O
nearby. O

The O
lady B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
we O
could O
even O
change O
tables O
during O
the O
crowd. O

When O
the O
restaurant O
is O
not O
full, O
it O
is O
no O
problem O
to O
eat O
your O
stomach O
full O
here O
at O
a O
quiet O
pace. O

But O
when O
it O
gets O
a O
little O
busy, O
people B-TARGET
in O
both O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
office O
have O
too O
short O
hands. O

People B-TARGET
try O
to O
help O
you O
smile O
where O
they O
can. O

The O
tables B-TARGET
don’t O
always O
seem O
just O
as O
proper, O
and O
here O
and O
there O
there’s O
something O
to O
replace O
(such O
as O
a O
cracking O
speaker). O

But O
it O
sounds O
worse O
than O
it O
is. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
good. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
different O
choices, B-TARGET
and O
the O
taste B-TARGET
is O
good. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
itself O
may O
seem O
a O
little O
strange O
at O
first, O
and O
many O
think O
they O
won’t O
have O
enough. O

But O
be O
careful, O
your O
stomach O
is O
full O
when O
you O
leave O
the O
case. O

If O
you O
read O
that O
some O
“do O
not O
dare O
to O
order O
because O
they O
may O
have O
to O
impose O
1 O
euro O
if O
they O
don’t O
get O
it O
on,” O
or O
“only O
water” O
drunk, O
then O
those O
“only O
with O
discount” O
people O
are O
allowed O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
me O
for O
a O
lot O
so O
that O
the O
rest O
is O
served O
faster. O

Food O
is O
perfect, O
we O
love O
it O
and O
it O
and O
we O
will O
come O
back O
someday O
without O
a O
doubt! O

We O
ate B-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
food, O
perfect!! O

Shusi’s B-TARGET
are O
good, O
but O
you O
have O
to O
be O
able O
to O
decide O
whether O
it O
contains O
wasabi O
and/or O
pepper. O

Hot B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
come O
from O
the O
microwave O
especially O
the O
spices B-TARGET
and O
spareribs B-TARGET
were O
tasteless. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
frequent O
shusi O
eater, O
skip O
this O
matter. B-TARGET

Unfortunately O
the O
cost O
made O
without O
dessert O
went O
away O
after O
3 O
rounds. O

Attracted O
by O
the O
nice O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
street O
and O
the O
delicious O
cheeses B-TARGET
in O
the O
vitrine, O
decided O
to O
make O
a O
lunch O
in O
this O
case. O

No O
menu, O
but O
just O
choose O
between O
the O
delicacies O
in O
the O
cold O
eye, O
I O
took O
a O
tortellini B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pancetta I-TARGET
promoted O
by O
the O
baker, O
super O
delicious! O

This O
in O
combination O
with O
fine O
music B-TARGET
on O
the O
background O
and O
a O
delicious O
glass O
white B-TARGET
for O
a O
very O
correct O
price. O

Definitely O
to O
try! O

The O
taste O
is O
really O
something O
else! O

Nice O
address B-TARGET
for O
lunch O
but O
also O
for O
something B-TARGET
delicious I-TARGET
to O
eat O
at O
home O
or O
drink O
a O
delicious O
glass O
of O
wine B-TARGET
with O
a O
selection O
of O
cheese! O

The O
owner O
does O
everything O
alone O
so O
he O
has O
his O
hands O
full! O

Prices O
are O
also O
very O
democratic. O

Everything O
is O
crafted O
artisanally. O

Also O
try O
one O
of O
the O
happy O
cakes B-TARGET
or O
quiches, B-TARGET
they O
are O
to O
lick O
your O
fingers! O

In O
short, O
an O
absolute O
recommendation! O

The O
beautiful O
location O
(St B-TARGET
Jorispoort) I-TARGET
drew O
us O
to O
the O
terrace. O

But O
the O
service B-TARGET
hit O
everything O
here. O

It O
seemed O
as O
if O
we O
were O
disturbing O
the O
cook, B-TARGET
although O
there O
was O
nobody O
beside O
us. O

He O
had O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
a O
particular O
court O
could O
not O
be O
obtained O
because O
he O
was O
busy. O

They O
looked O
around O
us. O

A O
look, O
a O
smile, O
a O
“tasteful” O
or O
“thank O
you” O
were O
far O
to O
look O
for. O

Maybe O
somewhere O
under O
a O
sprinkled O
lemon. O

There O
was O
also O
the O
account... O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
had O
not O
asked O
for O
the O
price O
(5 O
euros O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine B-TARGET
we O
could O
still O
accept) O
was O
a O
piece O
of O
focaccia B-TARGET
of O
5x5 O
cm O
or O
3 O
happen. O

This O
amounted O
to O
as O
much O
as O
8 O
euros. O

As O
for O
the O
taste, O
with O
which O
it O
is O
so O
sweetened, O
my O
soup B-TARGET
was O
as O
faint O
as O
in O
the O
diameter O
brasserie O
kitchen. O

The O
focaccia B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
that O
may O
be O
for O
a O
fortune. O

I O
wonder O
how O
long O
this O
rise B-TARGET
will O
last... O

If O
you’re O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
original O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
you’re O
at O
the O
right O
place. O

The O
store B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
open I-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
is O
beautifully O
furnished O
and O
the O
builder B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
in O
choosing O
the O
meal. O

Every O
day O
there O
are O
fresh O
cooked O
soups, B-TARGET
light O
meal B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
quiches O
and O
there O
is O
also O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
cheeses. B-TARGET

You O
can O
eat O
on O
site O
or O
takeaway. O

I O
chose O
the O
butterfly O
salad O
soup O
with O
honey O
from O
a O
local O
beekeeper O
and O
behind O
it O
a O
cheese O
board. O

The O
soup B-TARGET
was O
really O
great O
and O
the O
cheese, B-TARGET
which O
the O
builder O
had O
selected, O
was O
also O
definitely O
fine. O

With O
friends O
some O
go O
terraces O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
high O
street, O
at O
the O
pedestrian O
tunnel. O

Good O
eating, O
good O
drinking, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
honest O
cooking, O
toffen O
boss O
--->live O
the O
Steve!! O

Lovely O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
facility I-TARGET
is O
modern. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
casual O
in O
style, O
and O
friendly. O

Sometimes O
it O
takes O
a O
while O
before O
you O
get O
the O
attention O
when O
you O
want O
to O
order O
something. O

The O
tables B-TARGET
are O
very O
small, O
as O
in O
so O
many O
places O
in O
Antwerp. O

However, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
fine. O

I O
had O
some O
delicious O
cheesecakes B-TARGET
in O
advance. O

Cheers B-TARGET
are O
also O
delicious. O

We O
have O
something O
to O
celebrate O
and O
we O
decide O
to O
do O
it O
on O
Saturday. O

Finally, O
this O
restaurant O
is O
number O
1 O
on O
TripAdvisor O
for O
Antwerp. O

Expectations O
are O
so O
high O
and O
that O
is O
not O
always O
without O
risk. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
where O
you O
enter, O
pre-reservation O
is O
mandatory. O

With O
just O
12 O
couverts, O
this O
is O
understandable. O

Upon O
arrival, O
the O
facade O
of O
this O
beautiful O
mansion O
does O
not O
suggest O
that O
behind O
it O
is O
a O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
are O
welcomed O
by O
Sombat B-TARGET
with O
that O
typical O
Eastern O
courtesy. O

The O
back O
garden B-TARGET
with O
pond O
is O
beautiful, O
unfortunately O
it O
is O
too O
cold O
outside O
and O
we O
take O
the O
aperitif O
in O
the O
leather O
salon. O

This O
is O
a O
delicious O
cava B-TARGET
and O
included O
in O
the O
set O
menu O
price O
à O
50,00€ O
per O
person. O

In O
the O
meantime, O
we O
are O
testing O
the O
interior. O

That O
is O
beautiful, O
soothing O
and O
radiates O
an O
authentic O
Thai O
setting. O

It O
has O
more O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
a O
living O
room O
than O
of O
a O
formal O
restaurant. O

The O
whole B-TARGET
offers O
a O
high O
living O
room O
feeling, O
it O
is O
comfortable O
sitting O
here. O

We O
are O
placed O
at O
a O
table O
of O
4 O
with O
an O
unusual O
but O
nice O
shape. O

Anyone O
can O
talk O
to O
anyone O
without O
any O
problems. O

There O
we O
go. O

The O
2 O
snacks B-TARGET
are O
fresh O
and O
very O
tasty. O

The O
host O
Sombat O
tells O
us O
that O
the O
menu O
tonight O
includes O
5 O
courses. O

We O
start O
with O
"Chicken O
soup O
with O
cocomut, O
galanka, O
lemongrass, O
time, O
chili O
and O
coriandre". O

This O
is O
a O
fairly O
spicy O
soup, B-TARGET
acceptablely O
spicy O
and O
subtle O
in O
taste. O

Spicy O
seafood O
salad O
with O
vermicelli O
and O
herbs. O

This O
court B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
job. O

“Chicken O
and O
vegetable O
wraped O
in O
rice O
paper, O
sweet O
and O
sour O
sauce.” O

Very O
well O
prepared. O

The O
parade O
ends O
with O
"deep O
fried O
shrimps O
with O
curry O
served O
with O
cucumber O
sauce". O

There O
is O
nothing O
to O
be O
noted O
here O
either. O

The O
main O
dish O
comes O
with O
"grilled O
Scottish O
beef O
served O
with O
soy O
sauce O
and O
chilli O
powder, O
seafood O
sauté O
with O
chilli O
and O
basilicum, O
sauthé O
of O
fish O
filet O
with O
coconut O
in O
banana O
leaves O
and O
fresh O
vegetables O
with O
sésame O
oil". O

Here O
is O
the O
error. O

The O
amount B-TARGET
of O
food O
is O
too O
broadly O
measured, O
and O
with O
food O
waste O
I O
always O
have O
a O
problem. O

Also O
the O
harmony O
in O
structure O
and O
taste O
expression O
between O
the O
(te) O
numerous O
ingredients B-TARGET
goes O
completely O
into O
the O
fog. O

It O
is O
a O
pity, O
but O
this O
trial B-TARGET
failed. O

We O
drink O
a O
white O
Pouilly O
Fuissé O
and O
a O
red O
Sancerre. O

Both O
are O
excellent O
and O
moderately O
priced. O

Finish O
with O
an O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
composition I-TARGET
that O
is O
delicious. O

At O
the O
coffee O
is O
promptly O
offered O
cognac O
from O
the O
house, O
very O
attentive. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
common O
and O
polite, O
though O
on O
the O
timid O
side. O

This O
'Home B-TARGET
Cooking' I-TARGET
concept I-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
different O
from O
a O
formal O
restaurant. O

The O
ingredients B-TARGET
used O
are O
fresh O
and O
all O
in O
themselves O
tastefully O
prepared. O

But O
the O
harmony B-TARGET
is O
not O
always O
right O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
too O
broadly O
measured. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
better O
Thai B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
but O
it’s O
just O
not O
sophisticated O
gastronomy. O

But O
that O
won’t O
stop O
me O
from O
coming O
here O
on O
another O
occasion. O

After O
reading O
the O
numerous O
positive O
comments O
made O
a O
last O
minute O
reservation. O

Hospitality B-TARGET
top, O
surroundings B-TARGET
inside O
and O
outside O
to O
get O
completely O
relaxed O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
to O
dream O
of O
on O
the O
way. O

The O
discovery O
of O
the O
year. O

Satisfied O
in O
all O
respects O

When O
you O
come O
in O
Thailand, O
you O
feel O
right. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
stylish O
and O
cozy, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
garden B-TARGET
where O
we O
the O
aperitif. O

The O
food B-TARGET
(4 O
courses O
menu O
for O
50€) O
was O
very O
delicious O
and O
not O
too O
"spicy". O

The O
host B-TARGET
and O
his O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
ordinary O
and O
friendly. O

Sombat B-TARGET
Thai I-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
recommendation O
and O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
again. O

We O
an O
excellent O
lunch B-TARGET
with O
a O
super O
delicious O
dessert. B-TARGET

The O
modified B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
very O
friendly O
and O
we O
were O
lucky O
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
the O
inner B-TARGET
garden. I-TARGET

A O
real O
advisor. O

Don’t O
let O
the O
busy O
environment B-TARGET
scare O
you O
off. O

We O
chose O
a O
four-way O
menu. O

Since O
I O
could O
not O
eat O
mushrooms, O
this O
was O
easily O
replaced O
by O
another O
dish. O

I O
asked O
the O
sommelier O
which O
wine O
he O
proposed O
for O
about O
50€. O

It O
was O
the O
cheapest O
on O
the O
map. O

Either O
that, O
or O
the O
other, O
but O
I O
also O
have O
a O
Barbera O
of O
36€. O

Why O
was O
it O
not O
on O
the O
map? O

The O
amuses B-TARGET
and O
also O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
had O
a O
refined O
taste. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
were O
not O
very O
large. O

But O
when O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
the O
Irish B-TARGET
beef, I-TARGET
my O
4 O
pieces O
(7x2 O
cm) O
were O
full O
of O
pests O
that O
one O
could O
not O
cut O
through O
with O
a O
knife. O

I O
advertised O
to O
the O
boy. O

And O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
the O
chef B-TARGET
came O
with O
four O
stitches O
of O
meat. B-TARGET

It O
could O
not O
have O
been O
that O
he O
hadn’t O

The O
address B-TARGET
for O
that O
one O
special O

enjoy O
together O
and O
get O
messed O
up. O

The O
location B-TARGET
on O
a O
busy O
stone O
road O
is O
a O
relief, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
also O
not O
recommended. O

But O
the O
Indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is O
very O
delicious O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
incredibly O
friendly. O

Communication O
with O
the O

is O
important O
and O
your O

is O
really O
their O

That’s O
why O
I O

The O

It O
is O
located O
on O
the O
shopping O
street O
so O
it O
is O
also O
very O
convenient O
when O
shopping. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
that O
it O
is O
very O
busy O
around O
noon. O

Here O
you O
have O
a O
large O
quantity O
of O

for O
a O

The O

are O
definitely O
recommended! O

It O
is O
often O
very O
busy O
here. O

We O
were O
there O
last O

when O
we O
were O
in O

Now O
we O
have O
turned O

Dits O

really O
a O

The O
delicious O

Whenever O

The O

The O

was O
too O
expensive. O

There O
is O
little O

compared O
to O
what O
you O
pay. O

The O

The O

was O
flatty O

23,90 O

I O
personally O

a O

I O
also O
find O
quite O
expensive O
and O
easy. O

Simple O
adjustments O
to O
the O
dishes O
would O
already O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
difference. O

I O
like O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
fresh O
food. O

This O
was O
not O
worthy O
of O
his O
money. O

It O
can O
be O
better. O

Upon O
our O
arrival O
we O
were O
approached O
by O
the O
owner, B-TARGET
to O
our O
surprise, O
in O
an O
incredible O
verbal O
way. O

We O
had O
difficulty O
taking O
our O
place. O

Then O
he O
once O
again O
approached O
us O
excessively O
and O
impolently O
so O
that O
we O
didn’t O
even O
go O
through O
the O
menu. O

We O
left O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
immediately O
to O
never O
come O
back. O

Hopefully O
not O
all O
customers O
are O
dealt O
with O
that O
way O
or O
he O
can O
close O
the O
case O
within O
a O
month. O

Unfortunately, O
we O
cannot O
judge O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Just O
returned O
from O
a O
completely O
unsuccessful O
dinner B-TARGET
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Unfortunately, O
all O
the O
negative O
comments O
are O
correct. O

Poor O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
actually O
a O
refined O
café, O
where O
you O
want O
to O
invest O
as O
much O
money O
as O
possible O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
staff. O

There O
are O
star O
restaurants O
where O
the O
tables O
are O
cheaper, O
but O
where O
you O
are O
treated O
with O
respect. O

Here O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
thinks O
he O
is O
God O
the O
Father. O

Definitely O
not O
recommended, O
there O
is O
better O
to O
find O
for O
much O
less O
money O
in O
Gent. O

We O
had O
heard O
some O
good O
reviews O
about O
this O
restaurant, O
so O
we O
looked O
forward O
to O
a O
pleasant O
evening. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
looks O
nice, O
informal O
with O
the O
wooden O
tables O
and O
chairs, O
the O
(for O
this O
restaurant O
very O
extensive) O
menu B-TARGET
chart I-TARGET
written O
on O
a O
crystal O
board O
and O
the O
many O
(empty) O
wine O
bottles O
displayed. O

There O
is O
an O
impressive O
collection O
of O
grand B-TARGET
crus I-TARGET
from O
Bourgogne O
and O
top B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
from O
Bordeaux. O

So O
these O
are O
the O
empty O
bottles, O
one O
of O
which O
is O
not O
on O
the O
card. O

Per O
the O
chef O
wants O
to O
create O
a O
certain O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
although O
I O
can’t O
imagine O
what O
this O
should O
be. O

As O
an O
aperitif, O
I O
ordered O
a O
G&T. O

Where O
one O
usually O
gets O
a O
gin O
menu O
or O
yet O
at O
least O
a O
verbal O
list O
of O
what O
is O
available O
was O
given O
in O
from O
the O
service B-TARGET
the O
choice O
between O
"spicy" O
or O
"not O
spicy". O

When O
asked O
if O
I O
could O
see O
a O
list, O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
repeat O
the O
two O
alternatives. O

Now O
well, O
not O
everyone O
has O
the O
language O
skills O
to O
describe O
a O
distillate O
in O
extensive O
terms, O
so O
I O
ended O
up O
getting O
something O
I O
had O
"almost O
myself" O
picked O
out O
of O
the O
handful O
(idd, O
no O
longer) O
of O
gins B-TARGET
available O
in O
the O
chosen O
category. O

The O
apero B-TARGET
was O
well O
prepared, O
even O
on O
that O
of O
my O
wife O
was O
not O
noticeable. O

A O
fun O
had O
mss O
not O
been O
bad O
(as O
addition O
to O
the O
5 O
flinters O
raw O
ham B-TARGET
), O
but O
soit. O

Where O
we O
have O
the O
habit O
of O
ordering O
for O
our O
youngest O
daughter O
(11j) O
two O
pre-rices O
(pre- O
and O
main O
dish O
is O
too O
much, O
so O
waste) O
this O
was O
refused O
here O
without O
boe O
or O
ba. O

Even O
in O
the O
Paris O
brasseries O
that O
we O
visit O
regularly, O
this O
is O
never O
a O
problem, O
this O
is O
just O
to O
sketch O
an O
analogy. O

From O
this O
point O
on, O
I O
knew O
that O
the O
evening O
would O
not O
be O
what O
we O
had O
imagined. O

Probably O
this O
is O
a O
form O
of O
"policy", O
but O
not O
a O
form O
of O
management O
that O
is O
still O
being O
discussed O
today O
in O
most O
restaurants, O
not O
in O
an O
establishment O
like O
this. O

So, O
probably O
an O
OK O
restaurant B-TARGET
if O
you O
don’t O
go O
there O
with O
kids, O
and O
you O
don’t O
mind O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
behaves O
quite O
overwhelmingly. O

It O
is O
expensive, O
which O
reduces O
the O
total O
value O
even O
more. O

Garcon B-TARGET
arrogant O
and O
degoutant, O
can O
not O
tolerate O
criticism, O
and O
a O
boss B-TARGET
(cook) O
who O
does O
not O
move O
when O
something O
goes O
wrong. O

We O
ordered O
a O
large O
portion O
of O
gamba O
from O
$45 O
while O
we O
had O
small!! O

Gamba's B-TARGET
were O
ok O
but O
fries B-TARGET
were O
not O
too O
fried O
(thick O
slapped O
and O
baked O
in O
ou O
fruit O
fat!!!) O

Garcon, B-TARGET
follow O
a O
course O
of O
elementary O
politeness O
and O
customer-friendliness O
ipv O
arrogance O
and O
impudence, O
but O
this O
will O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
education! O

For O
us O
never O
again O
to O
this O
converted O
café O
to O
so-called O
(too O
expensive) O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
have O
been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
and O
always O
have O
the O
same O
impression: O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
its O
price O
is O
not O
worth O
it. O

They O
only O
have O
the O
most O
expensive O
bottles. O

And O
when O
you O
order O
a O
cheaper O
bottle O
they O
give O
an O
unimaginably O
denigrating O
look. O

They O
are O
not O
sympathetic. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
eat O
something O
small O
here, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
slow O
but O
if O
you O
are O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
this O
is O
very O
cozy. O

I O
go O
to O
the O
brewery O
every O
time O
I’m O
in O
Gent. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
tasty O
and O
fresh. O

Their O
bread B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
served O
as O
a O
dish O
with O
butter. O

The O
day B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
vegetarian, O
is O
warm, O
and O
made O
from O
seasonal O
vegetables. O

Their O
spaghetti B-TARGET
bolo I-TARGET
was O
correct, O
well O
spicy O
and O
served O
with O
cheese. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
slow O
but O
friendly. O

You O
can O

really O

A O
lot O
of O
choice, O
delicious O
and O
wellined, O
easy O
to O
find O

at O
the O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
no O
wheelchair O
patients O
can O
enter O
because O
it O
is O
on O
the O
first O
floor! O

Finally O
there O
are O
good O

where O
everything O
fits! O

A O
suggestion: O
also O
serve O
bread O
(so O
not O
just O
fries O
or O
potatoes, O
which O
is O
of O
course O
also O
delicious) O

On O
Friday O
evening O
we O
will O
enter O
at O
23:05 O
p.m. O

No O
one O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
makes O
the O
effort O
to O
accompany O
us O
to O
a O
table, O
because O
of O
too O
busy O
staff O
talks! O

We O
choose O
a O
place O
for O
ourselves O
and O
after O
5 O
min. O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
comes O
and O
kindly O
tells O
us O
that O
the O
kitchen O
is O
already O
closed. O

However, O
I O
read O
on O
the O
website O
that O
this O
restaurant O
is O
open O
until O
24h. O

We O
ate O
really O
super O
well! O

Long O
doubted O
between O
Amadeus, O
crowned O
heads O
and O
this. O

In O
the O
end, O
we O
chose O
this O
case B-TARGET
because O
it O
looked O
cozy O
and O
proper. O

We O
did O
not O
regret O
this. O

Pre-ordered O
with O
a O
drink. O

We O
didn’t O
have O
to O
wait O
too O
long O
for O
this, O
smooth O
service. B-TARGET

Then O
ribbons O
with O
honey, O
these O
also O
did O
not O
wait O
long O
for O
themselves. O

The O
ribbons B-TARGET
à I-TARGET
volonté I-TARGET
were O
super O
delicious, O
crocant O
and O
not O
burned. O

These O
were O
accompanied O
by O
vegetables, O
fries O
and O
sauces. O

Everything O
was O
fine O
and O
this O
for O
a O
good O
price. O

We O
will O
surely O
go O
back. O

It’s O
not O
Amadeus O
but O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
there O
smooth O
and O
good O
and O
the O
ribs B-TARGET
are O
very O
delicious O
and O
not O
as O
fat O
as O
in O
the O
previously O
mentioned O
case. O

We O
have O
been O
here O
several O
times O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
always O
the O
same O
thing O
that O
elsewhere O
dares O
to O
counter. O

M.i. O
a O
recommendation, O
however O
for O
the O
chateaubriand B-TARGET
bouquetière I-TARGET
: O
usually O
delicious O
meat O
and O
exaggeration O
in O
quantity, O
the O
vegetables O
swim O
in O
the O
butter O
but O
melt O
in O
your O
mouth. O

Sometimes O
it’s O
a O
little O
less, O
fortunately O
usually O
top. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
wines B-TARGET
have O
recently O
been O
stored O
another O
10-15% O
(a O
modal O
2010 B-TARGET
châteauneuf I-TARGET
du I-TARGET
pape I-TARGET
now O
costs O
90 O
euros). O

It O
is O
often O
crowded O
and O
rather O
noisy, O
ask O
for O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
guide O
michelins O
(max. O

The O
bar/lounge B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
smokers-annex I-TARGET
is O
cozy O
and O
manages O
to O
persuade O
people O
to O
stick O
to O
it O
every O
night. O

Not O
a O
top B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
but O
still O
a O
recommendation, O
especially O
for O
the O
Orlando O
bon-vivant O
with O
greater O
hunger. O

We O
will O
return O
regularly O
with O
pleasure. O

My O
partner O
and O
I O
had O
booked O
on O
Saturday O
(13/9/2014) O
at O
7:30 O
p.m. O

We O
had O
been O
here O
several O
times O
and O
knew O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
steaks B-TARGET
is O
top. O

At O
the O
reservation O
we O
had O
asked O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
veranda, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
noted. O

Fortunately, O
there O
was O
a O
table O
for O
2 O
persons O
free O
in O
the O
veranda O
so O
this O
was O
OK. O

Very O
soon O
we O
got O
a O
snack O
(plaque O
"Gentse O
Kop") O
and O
our O
order O
was O
received O
by O
a O
friendly O
lady. B-TARGET

We O
also O
ordered O
a O
bottle O
of O
white O
wine O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
water. O

After O
a O
few O
minutes, O
the O
wine O
and O
water O
came O
on O
the O
table. O

Not O
long O
after, O
our O
first O
meal O
was O
served. O

And O
then O
time O
went O
very O
slowly. O

The O
table O
was O
cleared O
and O
waiting O
for O
our O
main O
dish O
(filet O
pure: O
one O
bleu O
baked, O
the O
other O
bleignant) O
could O
begin. O

I O
thought O
we O
were O
still O
quite O
patient O
because O
only O
after O
waiting O
at O
1:30 O
we O
asked O
if O
we O
would O
get O
our O
food O
the O
same O
evening. O

In O
response, O
we O
were O
told, O
“If O
I O
can O
be O
honest, O
I O
really O
don’t O
know.” O

In O
the O
meantime, O
our O
bottle O
of O
wine O
was O
already O
empty O
so O
we O
ordered O
a O
second O
bottle. O

Around O
us O
we O
heard O
other O
people O
complain O
(some O
were O
already O
waiting O
at O
2:30). O

When O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
steak O
at O
21:45 O
(waiting O
after O
2:15), O
the O
steak B-TARGET
(which O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
bleu O
baked) O
was O
actually O
cold. O

Our O
friendly O
lady, B-TARGET
however, O
immediately O
intervened O
and O
took O
the O
steak B-TARGET
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
after O
which O
it O
was O
perfectly O
baked O
and O
served O
warm. O

We O
had O
seen O
the O
chef B-TARGET
welcome O
customers O
all O
night O
and O
talk O
so O
we O
actually O
wanted O
to O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
(long O
waiting O
times). O

We O
asked O
our O
maid O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
boss. O

She O
told O
us O
that O
she O
had O
asked O
him, O
but O
apparently O
he O
did O
not O
bother O
to O
come O
to O
us O
and O
give O
any O
explanation. O

You O
have O
to O
be O
at O
least O
BV O
to O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
boss. B-TARGET

Conclusion: O
Quality O
was O
top O
but O
the O
business B-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
does O
not O
decrease O
himself O
to O
talk O
to O
ordinary O
customers, O
he O
prefers O
to O
let O
the O
problems O
be O
solved O
by O
his O
staff O
rather O
than O
put O
things O
in O
order O
on O
his O
own. O

very O
sad O

Tof-Gezellig O
is O
delicious! O

I O
ordered O
the B-TARGET
six I-TARGET
different I-TARGET
sausages. I-TARGET

A O
unique O
framework! O

The O
best O
Sunday B-TARGET
brunch I-TARGET
I’ve O
ever O
had. O

A O
magnificent O
frame B-TARGET
with O
views O
of O
the O

(in O
fact, O
Coeur O
d'Artichaut O
is O
no O
longer O
located O
in O
Underbergen, O
but O
on O
the O
Korenlei!). O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
young, O
spontaneous, O
friendly, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
first O
name. O

It O
all O
starts O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
excellent O
Prosecco, B-TARGET
and O
then O
begins O
the O
actual O
buffet: O
soup, O
cold O
dishes, O
hot O
dishes, O
a O
special O
cooking O
pot O
from O
the O
chef O
(this O
time O
it O
was O
the O
belly O
spoon O
with O
trompettes O
de O
la O
mort), O
cheese O
barley, O
sweet O
sandwiches, O
dessert, O
a O
chocolate O
fountain. O

White O
and O
red O
wine O
were O
served O
at O
the O
table, O
as O
well O
as O
coffee. O

Definitely O
a O
recommender! O

The O
only O
advantage: O
friendly O
service B-TARGET

A O
small O
authentic O
Italian B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
near O
the O
old O
market. O

There O
is O
a O
wide O
selection O
of O
pizzas, B-TARGET
both O
vegetarian, O
meat O
and O
fish. O

Try O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
‘whisky’, I-TARGET
a O
recommendation! O

Cozy O
restaurant, B-TARGET
places O
on O
small O
3 O
floors O
with O
enough O
space. O

Fast O
service, B-TARGET
delicious O
pizza B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
normal O
prices. O

Remarkable O
is O
the O
number O
of O
types O
of O
pizzas, B-TARGET
never O
seen O
elsewhere O

The O
only O
thing O
in O
Leuven O
with O
really O
real, O
with O
refined O
sorbets B-TARGET
which O
also O
contains O
effective O
fruit O
(and O
no O
flavours O
+ O
sugar), O
huge O
bulbs O
and O
super O
friendly O
enthusiastic O
service! B-TARGET

Great O
ice B-TARGET
in O
the O
centre O
of O
Leuven. O

Ladauzeplein O
offers O
you O
beautiful O
benches O
where O
you O
can O
enjoy O
this O
delicious O
ice B-TARGET
cream. I-TARGET

The O
ice B-TARGET
balls I-TARGET
are O
distributed! O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
quite O
small O
for O
a O
brasserie. O

It’s O
delicious, O
but O
there’s O
hardly O
any O
bread O
on O
an O
omelette B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
spice, I-TARGET
for O
example. O

2 O
small O
baked B-TARGET
sandwiches I-TARGET
and O
a O
mini O
omelette B-TARGET
are O
actually O
a O
disappointment. O

The O
courts B-TARGET
were O
good. O

Since O
it O
is O
a O
leffe O
cafe, O
I O
expected O
an O
extensive O
range O
of O
beers, B-TARGET
but O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case. O

Especially O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
hills. O

In O
short, O
fun, O
fun O
but O
not O
top. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
good O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
friendly. O

When O
you O
are O
a O
birthday O
you O
get O
a O
free O
glass O
of O
spumante, O
but O
this O
you O
get O
only O
after O
eating O
ipv O
in O
advance O
as O
it O
should O
with O
an O
aperitif. O

We O
regularly O
eat O
at O
the O
Parma, O
one O
of O
the O
classic O
Leuven O
restaurants. O

The O
cuisine O
is O
rather O
Belgian-French O
(all O
kinds O
of O
steak O
preparations) O
but O
with O
excellent O
ingredients B-TARGET
(super O
mals O
meat). B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
quick. O

Especially O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
(cote O
à O
l'os, O
chateaubriand,...) O
carries O
our O
preference O
away. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
hip, O
but O
really. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
also O
quite O
classic, O
but O
delicious. O

An O
address O
for O
lunch. O

We O
have O
been O
out O
to O
eat O
at O
a O
restaurant O
in O
Timory O
several O
times. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
classically O
furnished O
and O
that O
radiates O
a O
charm. O

We O
the O
monthly O
suggestion O
“filet B-TARGET
pure I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
asparagus”; I-TARGET
classic O
prepared O
with O
respect O
for O
the O
vegetable. O

We O
also O
appreciate O
the O
attentive O
service O
of O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

An O
address B-TARGET
in O
Leuven O
where O
we O
go O
blindly O
again. O

I O
haven’t O
eaten O
in O
Timory O
yet, O
but O
I’ve O
tried O
the O
ice O
cups O
a O
few O
times. O

My O
favorite O
is O
the O
Emanuelle O
with O
bananas, O
banana O
liqueur B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

Also O
the O
Na-aper B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vanilla, I-TARGET
chocomousse, I-TARGET
banana I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
avocado I-TARGET
is O
very O
delicious. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
smooth O
and O
friendly O
and O
there O
is O
often O
a O
pleasant O
crowd. O

Prices O
are O
good. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
on O
the O
Market O
(the O
big O
square), O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
here O
because O
we O
already O
assumed O
that O
the O
quality O
would O
not O
be O
the O
best, O
it O
is O
very O
tourist O
here. O

After O
some O
time O
walking O
through O
the O
streets O
around O
the O
square, O
we O
saw O
a O
cozy O
tent B-TARGET
and O
decided O
to O
go O
inside, O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
rear O
entrance. O

The O
prices O
are O
really O
very O
high, O
for O
4 O
thin O
slices O
of O
burned O
steak B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
garlic I-TARGET
you O
pay O
€5.50, O
and O
to O
our O
great O
disappointment O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
à O
+/- O
€13.50 O
came O
out O
of O
the O
freezer! O

The O
service B-TARGET
also O
leaves O
nothing O
to O
be O
desired, O
there O
can O
not O
be O
a O
smile O
from. O

Spend O
your O
money O
elsewhere. O

As O
a O
tourist, O
you O
walk O
in O
the O
beautiful O
city O
of O
Bruges O
and O
at O
some O
point O
you O
feel O
like O
good O
food. O

You O
walk O
on O
the O
market O
where O
many O
dining O
establishments O
invite O
you O
with O
attractive O
priced O
menus O

You O
sit O
on O
the O
terrace O
and O
order O
something O
from O
the O
menu O
card. O

The O
main O
dishes O
do O
not O
contain O
potatoes O
or O
vegetables, O
which O
can O
be O
ordered O
as O
a O
supplement. O

NOTE: O
If O
the O
waitress O
asks O
if O
you O
want O
to O
have O
steak B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
butter, I-TARGET
this O
costs O
€5.5- O
euro O
for O
a O
plate O
with O
3 O
sad O
pieces O
of O
steak O
bread O
per O
person O
so O
not O
even O
a O
basket O
for O
more O
people! O

The O
friet B-TARGET
you O
have O
to O
order O
separately O
costs O
€,- O
for O
a O
very O
small O
portion O
and O
the O
sausage B-TARGET
of O
€3,- O
is O
too O
watery. O

Drinks B-TARGET
are O
unusually O
expensive, O
€6,- O
for O
a O
cola O
and O
€9,50 O
for O
a O
Belgian O
beer! O

And O
then O
they O
dare O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
step O
down O
because O
a O
group O
of O
10 O
people O
need O
your O
table. O

If O
you O
talk O
to O
the O
waitress O
about O
the O
price O
then O
he O
is O
familiar O
with O
this O
but O
it O
lies O
at O
the O
location, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
without O
explanation O
sell O
plates O
of O
stitch B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
for O
€5.5 O

This O
entrepreneur B-TARGET
clearly O
does O
not O
want O
to O
move O
customers O
to O
come O
back O
the O
next O
day, O
no, O
every O
customer O
they O
can O
turn O
out O
a O
foot O
is O
there O
is O
cash O
again O
and O
tomorrow O
there O
are O
hundreds O
of O
tourists O
again O
in O
this O
trap! O

If O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
ruin O
your O
stay O
in O
Bruges O
then O
do O
not O
go O
to O
the O
market O
to O
eat O
but O
find O
another O
fun O
dining O
tent O
where O
they O
are O
familiar O
with O
the O
term O
customer O
engagement O
and O
where O
the O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
normal! O

Very O
bad O
experience O
bad O
wine B-TARGET
is O
sold O
as O
home O
wine O
for O
18.50€/1/2 O
liters O
one O
does O
not O
dare O
to O
show O
the O
empty O
bottle, O
however, O
because O
there O
is O
widespread O
fraud O
committed O
with O
brand O
and O
quality O
fries B-TARGET
but O
half O
baked, O
sauce B-TARGET
cold O
and O
on O
every O
dish O
the O
same O
staff B-TARGET
is O
ashamed O
for O
the O
way O
they O
have O
to O
cheat O
the O
clientEL. O

Outdoors O
in O
the O
sun O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Eiermarkt, I-TARGET
a O
nice O
square O
adjacent O
to O
the O
Market. O

When O
the O
waitress O
handed O
us O
the O
menu O
card, O
we O
asked O
him O
for O
the O
menu O
written O
on O
the O
plate O
outside O
-3 O
corridors O
17.50 O
euro- O

This O
turned O
out O
to O
involve O
lunch, O
but O
we O
could O
safely O
order O
it, O
(it O
was O
about O
six O
in O
the O
evening) O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
only O
slightly O
smaller O
according O
to O
the O
waitress. B-TARGET

We O
decided O
to O
take O
the O
“adult” O
menu O
of O
29.50. O

Or O
were O
we O
in O
a O
hurry? O

No, O
we O
did O
not O
have O
it, O
we O
sat O
cozy, O
nice O
location, B-TARGET
people O
watching, O
beautiful O
weather! O

After O
a O
thick O
half O
hour, O
my O
fish B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
came O
and O
it O
was O
excellent, O
if O
only O
it O
was O
a O
little O
warmer. O

My O
partner’s O
cakes B-TARGET
were O
also O
delicious. O

Then O
the O
mosquitoes, O
for O
me O
in O
white O
wine O
and O
for O
my O
husband O
with O
garlic, O
't O
Taste O
fine, O
mosquitoes B-TARGET
some O
on O
the O
small O
side. O

A O
scale O
of O
frites. O

A O
few O
cups O
of O
lemon. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
friendly. O

The O
bill O
was O
82.50 O
euros, O
including O
a O
Kirr O
(5.-) O
and O
a O
carafe O
of O
white O
wine O
of O
a O
half O
ltr O
(18.- O
euro). O

Not O
cheap, O
but O
that O
we O
did O
not O
expect, O
I O
found O
Bruges O
generally O
quite O
expensive, O
not O
just O
Cafe B-TARGET
Belfort. I-TARGET

If O
we O
had O
read O
the O
reviews O
of O
this O
restaurant O
in O
advance, O
we O
would O
not O
have O
eaten O
there O
and O
that O
would O
have O
been O
a O
pity! O

Bar O
and O
bar O
bad O
tent. B-TARGET

I O
would O
dissuade O
everyone! O

I O
sit O
there O
now O
and O
we O
were O
just O
laughed O
at O
by O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
because O
we O
had O
ordered O
"but O
2 O
teas". O

No O
fools O
and O
we O
will O
never O
come O
here O
again! O

The O
self-sufficient O
ones! B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
(3 O
courses) O
were O
brought O
in O
40 O
minutes, O
the O
pre-cooked B-TARGET
was O
still O
edible, O
but O
the O
water B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
more O
bone O
than O
chicken O
and O
looked O
terribly O
wretched, O
the O
stool B-TARGET
was O
incredibly O
dry. O

Really O
recommended... O

A O
laughing O
show, B-TARGET
another O
already O
wrote O
here O
that O
it’s O
Fawlty O
Towers. O

We O
thought O
so O
too. O

We O
had O
taken O
a O
menu O
for O
17 O
euros, O
before O
paté B-TARGET
which O
tasted O
good. O

But O
then O
we O
got O
stew O
meat O
with O
fries. O

It O
seemed O
like O
a O
child’s O
portion, O
5 O
blocks O
of O
meat O
and O
a O
few O
fries. O

A B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
at O
the O
dinner O
they O
asked O
for O
$8. O

She O
tried O
to O
smell O
everything O
during O
the O
meal. O

Glad O
we O
did O
not O
do O
that. O

We O
could O
have O
gone O
to O
the O
fridge. O

What O
a O
rare O
ballet. B-TARGET

Already O
running O
over O
the O
cosy O
Eiermarkt O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
restaurant O
't O
Voutje. O

It O
looked O
nice O
from O
the O
outside. O

We O
had O
eaten O
somewhere O
else. O

Therefore O
selected O
for O
a O
limited O
menu O
of O
€17,- O

It O
was O
not O
wrong, O
the O
taste B-TARGET
was O
good. O

But O
apparently O
the O
blunder O
fell, O
because O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
our O
meal O
we O
started O
cleaning O
up O
the O
empty O
tables O
at O
9 O
a.m. O
and O
moving O
to O
the O
“night O
mode”. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
awkward, O
there O
could O
not O
be O
a O
laugh. O

In O
other O
words, O
no O
recommendation. O

I O
would O
really O
choose O
another O
restaurant O
next O
time, O
which O
are O
really O
enough O
there O
in O
Bruges. O

A O
question O
from: O
Foutje, O
thank O
you!!!!! O

In O
a O
Fawlty B-TARGET
Towers I-TARGET
scene, I-TARGET
the O
female O
Basyl O
in O
our O
presence O
was O
wiped O
out O
the O
mantle O
of O
the O
female O
John O
Cleese, O
the O
exploiter. O

The O
poor O
witch B-TARGET
had O
accidentally O
served O
us O
the O
mosquitoes O
of O
our O
neighbors. O

I O
ordered O
mushrooms, O
so O
I O
started O
eating. O

Suddenly O
the O
bowl O
of O
mushrooms O
was O
pulled O
from O
under O
my O
nose O
by O
the O
female O
John B-TARGET
Cleese. I-TARGET

My O
comment O
that O
I O
had O
already O
eaten O
of O
the O
mosquitoes O
was O
answered O
with O
a O
chagrinful O
snare O
that O
this O
meal O
would O
be O
deposited O
in O
the O
trash. O

A O
few O
seconds O
later, O
she O
came O
with O
a O
steel O
face O
serving O
the O
same O
scale O
to O
our O
neighbors. O

Funny O
for O
in O
a O
comedy, O
the O
reality O
is O
to O
cry, O
so O
amateur. O

Staying O
away O
from O
this O
valentine B-TARGET
is O
my O
only O
advice. O

He O
happened O
to O
come O
for O
lunch. O

Staff B-TARGET
not O
friendly. O

The O
card B-TARGET
does O
not O
list O
non-alcoholic O
beverages. O

If O
you O
ask O
for O
it, O
they O
only O
serve O
water O
per O
0.5l O
(whose O
price O
you O
do O
not O
know O

We O
ate O
chicken O
with O
fries. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
of O
very O
poor O
quality. O

Wine B-TARGET
was O
not O
to O

What O
a O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Menu B-TARGET
taken O
with O
various O
small O
dishes, O
great O
taste. O

And O
then O
the O
fish, B-TARGET
really O
good. O

Definitely O
a O
recommender. O

Our O
dinner O
at O
The B-TARGET
Olive I-TARGET
Tree I-TARGET
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
pure O
Greek, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
and O
attentive. O

We O
can O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
both O
locals O
and O
tourists. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
beautiful O
evening. O

Very O
friendly O
welcome O

very O

I O
have O
eaten O
delicious O
grilled B-TARGET
ink I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
there, O
due O
to O
its O
location B-TARGET
quite O
expensive O
and O
especially O
tourist-oriented, O
but O
still O
not O
a O
bad O
experience! O

Both O
the O

bring O
you O

that O
every O

The O

the O

Incredibly O

The O

chef B-TARGET
and O
Tom B-TARGET
is O
attentive O
and O
friendly! O

One O
of O
the O
best O
places B-TARGET
in O
Bruges! O

Definitely O
a O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
chose O
the O
three-day O
menu. O

We O
also O
had O
so O
many O
fun, B-TARGET
that O
it O
had O
easily O
passed O
through O
as O
a O
four-way. O

Everything O
perfect O
for O
taste, O
fun O
and O
surprising O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
toast B-TARGET
was O
somewhat O
on O
the O
karite O
side, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
top. O

I O
found O
the O
service B-TARGET
quite O
informal O
for O
the O
setting. O

No O
problem O
for O
me. O

At O
each O
court, O
it O
was O
clearly O
explained O
what O
it O
was O
and O
where O
it O
came O
from. O

Not O
a O
starworthy, O
but O
definitely O
a O
recommendation! O

What O
a O
great O
cook, O
what O
a O
delicious O
amuses. B-TARGET

This O
is O
a O
restaurant O
for O
special O

You O
will O
be O
messed O
up O
from O
the O
first O
snack O

the O

Everything O

very O

Since O
it O
was O
my O

I O
got O
a O

Very O

here! O

Great O

Great O

Reserve O

it O

very O
small. O

Her O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
a O
limited O
card O
but O
all O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
copious O
and O
delicious. O

The O
hostess, B-TARGET
also O
Bruges O
guide, O
makes O
the O
difference. O

What O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
romantic O
dinner B-TARGET
with O
a O
Grouponbon O
became O
a O
real O
flop. O

We O
have O
never O
eaten O
so O
badly! O

1 O
hour O
waiting O
for O
a O
bruchetta, B-TARGET
which O
was O
a O
dried O
piece O
of O
bread O
with O
some O
flat O
baked O
mushrooms! O

The O
main O
dish O
was O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
frozen I-TARGET
seafood I-TARGET
mix I-TARGET
and O
zero O
comma O
zero O
taste! O

Really O
no O
restaurant B-TARGET
worthy!! O

The O
only O
garniture O
was O
some O
unwashed O
peterson B-TARGET
that O
helped O
the O
dish B-TARGET
completely O
to O
the O
buttons. O

The O
sand O
is O
still O
cracking O
between O
my O
teeth. O

They O
didn’t O
have O
the O
tiramisu, O
so O
they O
ate O
a O
panna O
cotta. O

This O
was O
(from O
a O
pot), O
on O
a O
plate O
sprinkled O
with O
frozen O
red B-TARGET
fruits!! I-TARGET

Don’t O
give O
your O

here!! O

Find O
a O

Worse O
than O
this O
can’t O

It O

It O
is O
very O

Super O

It’s O
the O

Italian B-TARGET
place O
we O

Restaurant O

an O

a O

for O
an O

The O

the O

are O

Quality O

OK O

This O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious...My O

would O
have O
given O
a O
5 O

this. O

Top, O
we O
will O
definitely O
go O
back! O

We O
arrived O
here O
after O
reading O
the O
opinions O
on O
TripAdvisor! O

Unfortunately, O
you O
can O
only O
get O
lunch O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
but O
forests O
try O
this O
restaurant O
by O
themselves O
and O
have O
thus O
gone O
for O
the O
day O
lunch. O

Very O
delicious O
salad B-TARGET
with O
beautiful O
fresh O
salads, O
not O
those O
you O
often O
get O
served, O
right O
out O
of O
the O
bag! O

Slat O
finished O
with O
delicious O
dressing, B-TARGET
baked O
spikes O
and O
good O
feta. B-TARGET

As O
the O
main O
dish O
a O
piece O
of O
baked O
salmon O
with O
crumbs O
and O
fresh O
vegetables! B-TARGET

Especially O
the O
latter O
can O
be O
appreciated. O

This O
comes O
in O
very O
few O
cases O
and O
really O
appreciates O
your O
judgment! O

Everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
served O
in O
an O
hour. O

The O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
should O
not O
be O
forgotten O
either. O

There O
is O
something O
to O
go O
back O
and O
try O
out O
one O
of O
their O
menus O
or O
à O
la O
carte. O

We O
happened O
to O
come O
here O
looking O
for O
a O
restaurant. O

Going O
in O
based O
on O
the O
good O
Tripadvisor O
reviews. O

No O
regrets, O
the O
$35 O
market B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

We O
ate O
great O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
of O
$35 O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
taste O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
came O
well O
to O
their O
right. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
this O
beautiful O
building O
is O
unforced O
and O
pleasant. O

We O
can O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Brisbane. O

Very O
smooth O
operation, B-TARGET
toffe O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
on O
top O
of O
that O
very O
nice O
ribbons. B-TARGET

Price/quality O
is O
in O
order. O

Disadvantage: O
Hard O
to O
find O
parking O
nearby. B-TARGET

Friendly O
reception B-TARGET
and O
very O
smooth O
after-service. B-TARGET

The O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
( O
not O
the O
ribs O
taken) O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
huge. O

The O
price/quality O
is O
correct. O

Able O
to O
Repeat O

it O
was O
just O
a O
while O
ago... O
but O
yesterday O
made O
an O
unexpected O
stop, O
and O
of O
course O
could O
not O
resist O
these O
sweet O
temptations.... O
brownie B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
ginger I-TARGET
was O
superjammie!!!!! O

Very O
good O
patisserie! B-TARGET

The O
incredible O
eclairs. B-TARGET

I O
think O
the O
bread B-TARGET
is O
too O
expensive. O

Glad O
to O
see O
you O
in O
the O
studio! B-TARGET

Breakfast O
between O
the O
books O
is O
not O
often O
the O
case. O

Here O
you O
sit O
between O
walls O
full O
of O
books O
in O
a O
cozy O
decor. O

On O
top O
of O
the O
seats, O
you O
can O
read O
a O
book O
while O
enjoying O
your O
drink. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
is O
clean, O
fresh O
and O
delicious. O

There O
is O
a O
choice B-TARGET
between O
different O
formulas. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
smooth O
and O
friendly. O

Here O
comes O
lunch O
with O
a O
girlfriend, O
because O
our O
regular O
lunch O
bar O
was O
closed O
due O
to O
annual O
leave. O

Had O
already O
read O
a O
lot O
of O
positive O
things O
about O
it, O
but O
wish O
to O
explain O
our O
experience O
- O
although O
it O
is O
only O
so O
that O
the O
users O
may O
work O
on O
this. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
go O
for O
lunch O
during O
your O
lunch O
break, O
no O
one O
expects O
you O
to O
have O
eaten O
in O
10 O
minutes, O
otherwise O
you O
will O
get O
a O
sandwich. O

But O
in O
this O
case, O
they O
took O
their O
time! O

There O
were O
a O
number O
of O
5 O
tables O
occupied, O
a O
total O
of O
about O
12 O
people. O

1 O
table O
of O
4 O
was O
already O
browsing O
when O
we O
arrived, O
so O
that O
makes O
8 O
more O
people O
to O
be O
served. O

In O
the O
kitchen, O
a O
woman O
was O
cooking, O
a O
man O
was O
serving O
the O
room. O

Although O
we O
quickly O
got O
our O
drinks, O
it O
took O
quite O
a O
while O
before O
the O
man B-TARGET
came O
to O
pick O
up O
our O
order O
of O
food. O

Choice B-TARGET
is O
limited, O
covered O
bagels, O
special O
croques O
of O
thick O
cut O
bread, O
cheese/meat O
plate. O
eventually O
both O
I O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
took O
a O
croque. O

Well O
taken O
care O
of, O
with O
a O
little O
slash. O

Croque O
cheese O
and O
ham O
and O
croque O
with O
brie O
+ O
honey. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
25 O
minutes. O

I O
really O
do O
not O
understand O
this. O

Bread, O
wrap O
between O
them O
and O
in O
the O
panini. O

It O
cannot O
last O
so O
long. O

Other O
tables O
were O
served O
slowly. O

I O
understand O
that O
the O
woman O
in O
the O
kitchen O
also O
has O
only O
two O
hands, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
the O
man B-TARGET
stood O
behind O
the O
bar O
– O
if O
I’m O
not O
mistaken O
– O
playing O
with O
his O
mobile O
phone. O

If O
you O
have O
lunch-rush O
hour, O
you O
can O
still O
jump O
at O
least O
a O
moment O
at O
zn O
so O
that O
everyone O
is O
raped. O

Even O
after O
the O
meal O
it O
took O
at O
least O
another O
10 O
minutes O
(and O
a O
eyebrow O
of O
us) O
before O
the O
man B-TARGET
came O
to O
clean O
out O
our O
plates O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
something O
else. O

Our O
lunch O
break O
was O
almost O
over O
so O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
bill. O

This O
came O
as O
slow O
as O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
so O
we O
went O
to O
pay O
at O
the O
bar. O

It O
seemed O
to O
them O
to O
be O
quite O
impolite. O

Unbelievable O
that O
they O
don’t O
understand O
that O
many O
people O
have O
to O
go O
back O
to O
work O
after O
an O
hour’s O
afternoon O
break O
and O
that O
there’s O
no O
play O
here!! O

Plus: O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
cared O
for. O

(But O
with O
a O
toast O
you O
can O
also O
do O
little O
wrong.) O

Prices O
are O
also O
really O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
for O
lunch, B-TARGET
if O
I O
pay O
more O
than O
15 O
euros O
for O
lunch O
I O
have O
at O
most O
bistroes O
already O
a O
steak O
+ O
friet, O
full-au-vent, O
or O
a O
well-maintained O
plate O
of O
pasta. O

For O
1 O
toast O
and O
1 O
cup O
of O
cola O
this O
is O
seriously O
exaggerated!! O

Conclusion: O
go O
here O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time, O
or O
if O
you O
just O
want O
to O
drink O
a O
coffee/tea O
while O
reading O
a O
book. O

Unlike O
many O
catering, O
they O
won’t O
drive O
you O
away O
here O
because O
you’ll O
sit O
down O
for O
too O
long. O

If O
you O
only O
have O
an O
hour O
to O
eat, O
you O
should O
go O
somewhere O
else. O

It O
was O
pleasantly O
staying, O
very O
friendly O
people B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
definitely O
proper, O
a O
quick O
decent O
snack. O

Anyone O
who O
is O
crazy O
about O
self-made B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
is O
at O
the O
right O
place. O

The O

Super O
good O

Certainly O
I O
will O
come O
back O

A O
must O
do O
in O
the O
bridge. O

Extremely O
cozy O
family B-TARGET
business, I-TARGET
where O
they O
carry O
"service B-TARGET
with O
a O
smile" O
high O
in O
the O
banner. O

They O
really O
put O
you O
in O

watts. O

You O
can O
go O
there O
for O
an O
extensive O
breakfast, B-TARGET
a O
light O
lunch O
or O
an O
afternoon O
tea. O

Topers O
are O
the O
fresh O
chocolate B-TARGET
milk, I-TARGET
the O
Victoria B-TARGET
spongy I-TARGET
cake, O
cheesecake, B-TARGET
and O
the O
scrambled B-TARGET
eggs I-TARGET
bagel. I-TARGET

All B-TARGET
home O
made, O
of O
course. O

The O
seasonal O
map, B-TARGET
great O
service B-TARGET
and O
pleasant O

make O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
very O
good! O

Really O
a O
recommendation! O

At O
the O
recommendation O
of O
Carolien O
of O
B&B O
Côte O
Canal O
in O
Bruges O
we O
arrived O
here. O

We O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET

the O
food. B-TARGET

The O

bring O
you O
a O
pure, O
sophisticated O
and O
high-quality O
kitchen B-TARGET
in O
a O
fairy-tale O
setting. B-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back. O

Pomperlut B-TARGET
is O
an O
atmospheric O
restaurant, O
beautifully O
furnished O
and O
cosy. O

Few O
options, O
but O
enough O
to O
serve O
a O
delicious O
menu. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
cool O
but O
correct. O

A O
recommended O
for O
the O
winter O
months O
when O
the O
large O
fireplace O
gives O
delicious O
crimping O
heat. O

A O
pleasant O
and O
pleasant O
framework. B-TARGET

Great O
food, O
more O
than O
usual. O

Ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
or O
with O
friends. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back, O
but O
maybe O
only O
with O
women, O
because O
Peter, B-TARGET
who O
was O
our O
servant, O
was O
a O
streling O
to O
the O
eye. O

Also O
very O
nice! O

By O
chance O
in O
this O
"chalet" O
ended O
where O
we O
on O
the O
indoor O
terrace O
a O
delicious O
piece O
of O
"Limousin" B-TARGET
meat. I-TARGET

Super O
toffe O
service, B-TARGET
custom O
wines B-TARGET
and O
that O
in O
a O
beautiful O
and O
quiet O
setting, B-TARGET
away O
from O
the O
crowd O
at O
't O
Sand O
and O
its O
tourist O
traps. O

It O
was O
a O
breath O
for O
us O
to O
take O
a O
moment O
out O
of O
the O
crowd O
of O
the O
market O
in O
Bruges O
in O
all O
peace O
and O
very O
atmospheric O
to O
enjoy O
a O
delicious O
meal. B-TARGET

Already O
in O
the O
menu B-TARGET
you O
will O
be O
informed O
about O
lactose O
and O
gluten-free O
recipes. O

The O
combination B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
was O
special. O

It O
is O
wonderful. O

It O
is O
not O
always O
easy O
for O
vegetarians O
to O
find O
a O
restaurant O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
well O
and O
stylishly. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
can O
do O
it. O

Wonderful, O
honest O
and O
separate. O

If O
living O
in O
Bruges, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
recommend O
and O
one O
that O
I O
would O
recommend O
to O
others. O

There O
is O
careful O
and O
very O
fresh O
food. B-TARGET

The O
chef B-TARGET
shows O
a O
great O
drive O
and O
passion O
for O
his O
profession. O

I O
have O
been O
here O
several O
times O
and O
it O
was O
always O
fine. O

You O
get O
more O
than O
worth O
your O
money! O

Have O
eaten O
here O
several O
times O
and O
every O
time O
smooth O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
to O
eat, O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
large O
portions B-TARGET
too. O

Very O
reasonable O
price O
and O
lots O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
you O
will O
not O
find O
anywhere O
else O
right O
away. O

The O
lasagne B-TARGET
is O
great. O

Continue O
this O
way! O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
had O
a O
good O
meal O
here. O

Not O
the O
usual O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
something O
else. O

Beautiful, O
modern O
interior B-TARGET
and O
a O
chef B-TARGET
you O
notice O
that O
he O
is O
extremely O
passionate O
about O
eating! O

The O
fresh O
limonade B-TARGET
we O
found O
some O
bitter O
taste O
but O
the O
food, O
in O
our O
case O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
quiche I-TARGET
tasted O
incredibly O
good. O

And O
then O
I O
haven’t O
talked O
about O
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
a O
private O
version O
of O
a O
snicker O
an O
absolute O
recommendation. O

I O
found O
this O
restaurant O
via O
TripAdvisor. O

When O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
and O
saw O
the O
pictures, O
I O
definitely O
wanted O
to O
eat. O

When O
you O
enter O
this O
little O
restaurant, B-TARGET
you’ll O
be O
immersed O
in O
what O
I O
think O
the O
ideal O
world O
should O
be O
according O
to O
these O
two O
cute O
young O
people. O

In O
an O
hour O
you O
get O
to O
rest, O
eat O
fantasticly O
good O
and O
see O
two O
people B-TARGET
who O
are O
100% O
behind O
this O
concept. O

I O
would O
say O
keep O
doing O
this O
and O
we O
will O
definitely O
see O
you O
again. O

We O
ate O
well O
and O
the O
delicious O
wine. B-TARGET

Operation B-TARGET
was O
nice, O
ambiance B-TARGET
atmospheric O
and O
cosy. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
evening, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back! O

The O
Park B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
is O
worth O
considering, O
but O
rather O
as O
a O
total O
concept: O
very O
friendly O
and O
personal O
reception, B-TARGET
beautiful, O
cozy O
and O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
warm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
background O
music O
(we O
sat O
in O
the O
second O
part O
on O
an O
intermediate O
floor, O
to O
recommend) O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
"good O
burger O
kitchen", O
do O
not O
expect O
top O
gastronomy. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
delicious O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
made O
with O
fresh O
ingredients. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
(a O
lot O
of O
staff O
present) O
but O
lacks O
some O
experience O
and O
smoothness, O
sometimes O
quite O
inconvenient. O

There O
may O
be O
1 O
point O
of O
attention: O
the O
sanitary B-TARGET
is O
very O
clean O
and O
spacious, O
but O
there O
is O
only O
1 O
toilet O
for O
ladies O
and O
1 O
for O
men. O

Not O
much O
for O
a O
large O
restaurant. O

Eat B-TARGET
well O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
attentive O
and O
knows O
what O
they O
are O
talking O
about O
like O
the O
wine O
and O
what O
snacks O
you O
get O
on O
your O
plate O

Also O
the O
personal O
attention O
of O
the O
chef B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice O
I O
would O
recommend O
everyone O
to O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
once O
but O
book O
via O
the O
internet O

We O
ate O
at O
Park B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
last O
weekend O
to O
celebrate O
my O
friend’s O
birthday O
and O
it O
was O
a O
very O
successful O
evening. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
was O
to O
smell O
out, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
fits O
perfectly O
with O
the O
dishes, O
and O
we O
were O
very O
kindly O
received. O

Recommended O
for O
a O
weekend O
in O
Bruges! O

Unspoiled O
service, B-TARGET
very O
high O
prices, O
51 O
euros O
for O
3 O
coffee, O
3 O
"apple O
pastries" O
and O
2 O
cola. O

And O
if O
you O
hit O
the O
arrow O
a O
big O
mouth...the O
customer O
should O
not O
cheer O
but O
had O
to O
give O
a O
fooi. O

We O
hope O
that O
something O
can O
be O
done O
about O
this, O
because O
this O
is O
an O
absolute O
low O
point O
in O
such O
a O
beautiful O
city. O

Staff B-TARGET
don’t O
look O
at O
you, O
chew O
your O
food O
on O
your O
table O
and O
don’t O
even O
bother O
to O
say O
anything O
to O
you. O

If O
you O
ask O
for O
bread B-TARGET
you O
get O
a O
pile O
of O
butter O
hammer O
from O
a O
plastic O
bag. O

And O
that O
at O
the O
prices B-TARGET
: O
4 O
Euro O
80 O
for O
a O
slice O
and O
six O
and O
a O
half O
Euro O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
white O
house O
wine. O

Number O
one O
tourist. O

Avoid O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

On O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
hotel, O
we O
visited O
this O
restaurant. O

Great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
an O
attractive O
map. B-TARGET

All O
members O
of O
our O
company O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
successful O
evening. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive. O

A O
point O
of O
attention O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
is O
the O
use O
of O
herbs; O
where O
the O
soup B-TARGET
to O
my O
taste O
had O
a O
too O
pronounced O
pepper O
flavor O
which O
overshadowed O
other O
flavors, O
the O
hemp B-TARGET
nuts I-TARGET
were O
rather O
"laf" O
spicy. O

Given O
the O
price O
level, O
I O
find O
perfection O
the O
norm O
and O
that O
level O
has O
just O
not O
been O
reached O
tonight. O

This O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
Bruges O
side O
street O
is O
a O
real O
recommendation. O

From O
the O
moment O
I O
got O
in, O
I O
felt O
at O
home, O
everything O
broke. O

We O
had O
chosen O
the O
suggestion O
menu O
with O
adapted O
wines. O

Especially O
the O
baby B-TARGET
cancer I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
water I-TARGET
sludge I-TARGET
surprised O
me O
very O
pleasantly. O

I O
can O
only O
agree O
with O
the O
other O
loving O
reviews. O

Table O
with O
7 O
men O
on O
occasion O
of O
retirement O
exhibition. O

Various O
aperitives, O
the O
monthly O
menu O
with O
custom O
wines, O
dessert, O
coffee+pousse-café. O

It O
is O
meevaller! O

This O
small O
restaurant O
located O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Bruges O
in O
the O
Amandstraatje O
has O
been O
around O
for O
27 O
years O
with O
the O
same O
chef O
and O
his O
lovely O
wife. O

Finally, O
again O
a O
classic O
cuisine, B-TARGET
fresh O
and O
delicious O
without O
much O
old O
cinema! O

Price O
quality O
excellent, O
we O
were O
with O
4 O
and O
the O
monthly O
menu. O

We O
were O
here O
on O
Saturday O
night O
with O
a O
group O
of O
17 O
people O
and O
were O
received O
super O
friendly! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
smooth. O

Even O
with O
such O
a O
large O
group, O
everyone O
could O
simply O
choose O
the O
card. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
October O
we O
were O
still O
able O
to O
aperitive O
outside O
on O
the O
terrace O
above O
and O
then O
eat O
inside. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

A O
lot O
of O
choice B-TARGET
and O
everyone O
was O
satisfied O
with O
his/her O
judgment. B-TARGET

A O
big O
tribute O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
this O
case! O

Someday... O

Or O
there O
was O
once... O

Most O
fairy O
tales O
generally O
start O
so O
and O
so: O
‘Ooit’ O
was O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
be O
with O
a O
sympathetic O
patron, O
good O
service O
and O
good O
food... O

Unfortunately, O
we’ve O
seen O
this O
more O
and O
more O
over O
the O
last O
few O
years, O
and O
it’s O
gone O
to O
a O
level O
below O
any O
level: O
customer-unfriendly O
pattern, B-TARGET
poor O
food B-TARGET
and O
no O
service... B-TARGET

Only O
the O
kching O
of O
the O
box O
counts O
and O
you O
are O
not O
satisfied? O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
door... O

The O
best O
advice? O

Just O
stay O
away O
from O
here, O
because O
there O
are O
much O
better O
and O
more O
sympathetic O
catering O
in O
Oostende O
where O
they O
at O
least O
still O
know O
what O
good O
food O
and O
real O
customer-friendly O
service O
is! O

Oh O
well... O

We O
have O
been O
here O
several O
times, O
last O
times O
it O
was O
always O
very O
good. O

This O
time O
I O
took O
the O
fish B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
'little I-TARGET
bouillabaise' I-TARGET
this O
was O
in O
my O
opinion O
very O
underweight, O
The O
soup O
didn't O
taste O
like O
fish, O
there O
was O
a O
large O
piece O
of O
salmon O
in O
it O
(which O
I O
don't O
like: O
so O
not O
their O
fault) O
there O
was O
the O
head O
of O
a O
langoust O
in O
it O
(I O
like O
it) O
so O
sadly O
only O
the O
head. O

The O
shells O
were O
too O
far O
away O
and O
there O
were O
crabs O
inside. O

So O
when O
asked O
it O
was O
nice: O
no+the O
reason, O
so O
you O
would O
think O
a O
small O
discount O
or O
a O
coffee, O
but O
nothing O
of O
this. O

The O
coffee O
we O
paid O
for O
ourselves O
and O
after O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
6 O
years O
no O
drinking O
money O
left O
even O
a O
good O
day O
out. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
and O
then O
complain. O

And O
say O
that O
we O
already O
recommended O
this O
matter B-TARGET
to O
friends. O

Thierry O
Loenens O

Meat O
and O
fish B-TARGET
of O
the O
best O
quality, O
friendlyly O
served O
in O
a O
professional O
way. O

(Not O
by O
chance, O
we O
have O
been O
there O
many O
times!) O

I O
have O
nothing O
to O
note O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
just O
too O
expensive. O

The O
Irish B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
comes O
to O
the O
chef’s B-TARGET
table, O
you O
pay O
10 O
euros O
for O
it O
and O
this O
is O
also O
just O
too O
expensive. O

When O
we O
left O
the O
case O
we O
were O
almost O
obliged O
to O
write O
a O
good O
review O
here. O

This O
is O
just O
my O
honest O
opinion. O

Super O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
dog-friendly! O

We O
even O
brought O
our O
excess O
meat O
home O
in O
a O
convenient O
reusable O
microwave-friendly O
pot. O

Keep O
going O
like O
that!! O

P.s. O
show O
assured O
if O
you O
are O
an O
Irish O
coffee O
lover. O

We O
were O
six O
people O
and O
we O
expected O
more. O

2 O
of O
us O
had O
ordered O
the O
salmon O
from O
to O
and O
at O
the O
24€ O
with O
fries O
1 O
had O
the O
steak B-TARGET
(not O
yet O
125 O
gr) O
23€ O
with O
fries O
1 O
had O
sat O
19€ O
with O
fries O
1 O
scampi O
in O
curry O
with O
bread O
the O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
was O
not O
to O
be O
seen O
and O
the O
steak B-TARGET
almost O
not O
to O
be O
found. O

Luckily, O
they O
served O
it O
on O
a O
plate O
without O
garment O
that O
stood O
separately O
in O
a O
bowl O
on O
the O
plate, O
otherwise O
we O
would O
not O
have O
found O
the O
piece O
of O
fish O
or O
meat. O

1 O
dish O
of O
fries B-TARGET
for O
5 O
adults O
was O
considerably O
underweight O
and O
re-ordered O
fries O
came O
after O
our O
plates O
had O
been O
empty O
for O
a O
while. O

However, O
they O
had O
been O
repaired O
in O
time. O

After O
we O
informed O
the O
pattern B-TARGET
of O
our O
dissatisfaction, O
he O
arrogantly O
stood O
by O
us O
and O
pointed O
out O
that O
these O
are O
the O
normal O
portions O
he O
presents O
to O
his O
customers. O

We O
wonder O
if O
the O
children’s O
portions O
are O
of O
the O
same O
size O
as O
ours. O

(Children O
don’t O
eat O
their O
stomachs O
full, O
adults) O

You O
are O
warned! O

With O
a O
groupon O
going O
to O
eat O
in O
this O
case. O

Already O
poorly O
eaten, O
tastes O
can O
vary, O
but O
being O
sick O
of O
that O
is O
really O
no O
longer O
normal O
to O
call. O

Pre-cooked: O
“Light B-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
tuna” I-TARGET
was O
baked. O

'Scampi B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
look' I-TARGET
wasn't O
exaggerated, O
they O
swam O
in O
the O
butter, O
incredibly O
much O
look. O

I O
taste O
it O
the O
day O
after, O
and O
everything O
has O
come O
back O
for O
hours. O

Bake O
ribbons O
with O
3 O
sauces, O
ribbons B-TARGET
had O
just O
once O
been O
heated, O
the O
taste O
was O
a O
bit O
strange, O
but O
I O
thought O
of O
a O
strange O
marinade. O

The O
sauces B-TARGET
(home O
made?) O
had O
exactly O
multiple O
colors O
(for O
clarity, O
the O
same O
sauce O
had O
different O
colors O
after O
mixing O
them). O

There O
was O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
fat O
on O
the O
ribbons. B-TARGET

My O
girlfriend’s O
bearness O
sauce O
steak O
was O
ordered O
saignant, O
but O
bien O
cuit O
delivered, O
after O
making O
this O
clear O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
answered, O
oh O
I O
said O
bc O
but O
I O
didn’t O
actually O
know, O
will O
be O
saignant, O
the O
steak O
was O
just O
not O
black... O

The O
fries... B-TARGET
but O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
same O
atmosphere O
as O
other O
comments, O
even O
these O
in O
the O
MacDonalds O
are O
better. O

The O
piece B-TARGET
that O
was O
given O
was O
OK. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
the O
best, O
but O
we O
were O
lucky. O

The O
same O
tiramisu B-TARGET
at O
the O
neighbors O
was O
hard O
and O
only O
warm O
at O
the O
bottom, O
sounds O
like O
a O
microwave O
to O
me. O

The O
mine O
didn’t O
have O
this, O
but O
I O
had O
ordered O
the O
dessert O
in O
advance, O
the O
neighbors O
after O
their O
main O
dish. O

My O
girlfriend O
had O
an O
apple B-TARGET
cake, I-TARGET
which O
she O
liked. O

The O
wine... B-TARGET
let O
us O
say O
that O
I O
have O
already O
drank O
it O
better O
for O
much O
less O
than O
22 O
euros. O

Immediately O
after O
the O
dessert O
we O
left O
without O
words, O
considering O
other O
comments O
a O
good O
decision. O

After O
10 O
minutes O
we O
are O
home, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
feels O
it O
already O
coming, O
straight O
to O
the O
toilet. O

I O
myself O
all O
night O
and O
night O
uncomfortable, O
feeling O
like O
I O
have O
to O
vomit O
but O
it O
doesn’t O
come. O

I O
wake O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
get O
everything O
out. O

This O
case B-TARGET
should O
be O
closed, O
because O
I’m O
clearly O
not O
the O
only O
one O
who O
has O
had O
a O
bad O
experience O
here. O

The O
seafront O
does O
not O
always O
have O
a O
good O
reputation, O
but O
things O
like O
this O
do O
not O
do O
well O
to O
it. O

Yesterday, O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
out O
for O
a O
good O
meal O
with O
the O
good O
weather. O

He O
ordered O
a O
pasta O
carbonara, O
I O
ordered O
a O
pancakes O
with O
sugar. O

When O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
food O
at O
the O
table O
after O
half O
an O
hour, O
we O
took O
each O
1 O
bite O
of O
our O
dish B-TARGET
to O
realize O
that O
it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
rubbed! O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
carbonara I-TARGET
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
hard O
layer O
of O
cold O
cheese, O
cream O
and O
soaked O
spaghetti, O
and O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
were O
exactly O
made O
in O
a O
pan O
they O
hadn’t O
washed O
for O
days. O

Horribly O
simply! O

The O
waitress O
(a O
job O
student) O
went O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
with O
our O
dishes O
but O
we O
just O
got O
them O
back, O
and O
the O
chef B-TARGET
said O
these O
two O
dishes O
were O
normal O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
it. O

Because O
my O
friend O
had O
barely O
taken O
2 O
passes O
of O
his O
pasta, O
he O
refused O
to O
pay O
it, O
after O
which O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
did O
very O
frankly O
and O
forced O
us O
to O
pay!!!!!!! O

We O
will O
never O
come O
back O
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone. O

Even O
for O
free O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
and O
it O
ruins O
your O
day O
and O
mood. O

If O
I O
could O
I O
would O
place O
it O
on O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
itself O
a O
label O
to O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
visitors!!!!!!! O

Nice O
and O
comfortable O
family O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Class O
meals B-TARGET
and O
positive O
in O
price/quality. O

Come O
out O
with O
a O
satisfied O
and O
happy O
feeling. O

Great O
people B-TARGET
with O
a O
nice, O
friendly O
and O
cared O
for O
appearance. O

more O
than O
susceptible O
to O
repetition, O
recommend. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
class O
meals. B-TARGET

For O
me, O
the O
coolest O
and O
most O
enjoyable O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Ostende. O

I O
will O
go O
here O
regularly O
and O
then O
not O
only O
for O
the O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
but O
also O
for O
the O
hospitality. O

We O
were O
very O
welcomed O
by O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

Then O
the O
food B-TARGET
came O
and O
it O
was O
perfect! O

The O
best O
chicken B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
lamb I-TARGET
of O
all O
time. O

The O
couscous B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
well O
prepared. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back. O

Everything O
tip O
top O
in O
order... O
food B-TARGET
super O
delicious... O
whole O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
so O
much O
more... O
very O
nice O
for O
family O
occasions... O
little O
money O
and O
a O
lot O
to O
eat... O

Comfortable O
renovated O
terrace, B-TARGET
but O
because O
it O
was O
fresh O
was O
still O
just O
going O
to O
eat O
inside. O

Very O
outdated O
restaurant, B-TARGET
dusty O
curtains, O
benches O
and O
chairs O
seriously O
damaged, O
moss O
nature O
ordered. O

Three O
hairs O
(from O
the O
cook) O
came O
against. O

Rusted B-TARGET
and O
well O
damaged. O

Flat O
fries B-TARGET
added, O
sour O
and O
running O
mayo. B-TARGET

The O
girlfriend O
was O
full B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
guy, O
but O
he O
looked O
like O
he O
had O
eaten O
before. O

I O
don’t O
see O
them O
there O
anymore, O
too O
expensive O
for O
such O
a O
poor O
quality! O

I’m O
not O
often O
critical O
of O
my O
food. O

If O
it O
is O
good, O
it O
is O
good. O

But O
this O
was O
all O
but O
good. O

Very O
unfriendly O
staff B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
moderate. O

The O
price-quality O
ratio O
is O
not O
correct O
here. O

No O
to O
recommend. O

Without O
your O
money. O

This O
is O
definitely O
not O
recommended, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
faint. O

If O
you O
like O
to O
eat O
well O
this O
is O
definitely O
not O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
should O
take, O
there O
are O
many O
better O
in O
Oostende, O
sorry O
because O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
beautiful... O
on O
the O
market O

Have O
you O
eaten O
groupon O
several O
times? O

Don’t O
imagine O
a O
top-performing O
restaurant, O
but... O
we O
were O
welcomed O
kindly, O
received O
a O
proper O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

There O
were O
going O
to O
eat O
on O
Sunday O
evening O
2 O
November O
with O
bon O
of O
groupon, O
had O
a O
wide O
selection O
of O
menus, B-TARGET
got O
a O
nice O
table B-TARGET
at O
the O
window O
with O
candlestick, O
good O
and O
fast O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
really O
good, O
nothing O
to O
notice. O

Where O
do O
these O
bad O
reviews O
come O
from??? O

Of O
course O
there O
is O
a O
large O
terrace O
at O
the O
institution O
and O
in O
the O
summer O
with O
good O
weather O
it O
is O
there O
then O
sometimes O
overcrowded, O
but O
that O
one O
knows O
when O
we O
come O
to O
the O
sea O
with O
good O
weather O
that O
one O
then O
asks O
for O
problems, O
which O
then O
start O
generally O
already O
on O
the O
highway, O
no O
parking O
spaces, O
etc O
etc O
etc O
etc O
etc O

We O
sat O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
full O
in O
the O
autumn O
sun, O
wonderful O
place! O

Unfortunately, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
could O
order. O

Menu B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
unclear O
(French O
and O
Dutch O
mixed). O

Really O
delicious O
soup B-TARGET
and O
croquettes. B-TARGET

But O
the O
lady B-TARGET
from O
the O
service O
blamed O
two O
other O
guests O
for O
a O
disagreement O
on O
the O
receipt. O

A O
little O
later, O
my O
girlfriend O
was O
also O
chased O
away O
because O
she O
took O
the O
wrong O
door O
to O
the O
toilet. O

Never O
again! O

If O
I O
read O
the O
most O
recent O
reviews O
I O
can, O
after O
my O
visit O
on O
Saturday O
evening O
25/10 O
only O
beam O
that O
a O
little O
elementary O
"class" O
is O
far O
away O
to O
look O
for. O

Indeed, O
long O
wait, O
drink B-TARGET
not O
cooled, O
rude, O
no, O
rude O
service, B-TARGET
burned O
food B-TARGET
and O
then O
if O
you, O
as O
a O
customer, O
carefully O
make O
a O
comment, O
you O
should O
(dixit) O
"stop O
with O
sewers"... O

It O
is O
my O
personal O
impression O
that O
this O
case B-TARGET
is O
about O
(day) O
tourists O
or O
customers O
who O
come O
here O
once O
and O
never O
again. O

They O
will O
never O
see O
me O
here O
again! O

Mrs. O
Mr. O
I O
have O
always O
remained O
polite O
and O
correct, O
and O
I O
promised O
you, O
after O
the O
police O
visit, O
which O
I O
naturally O
pulled O
to O
the O
shortest O
end, O
that O
I O
would O
not O
leave O
here. O

You O
can O
consider O
this O
as O
step O
one. O

This O
is O
a O
promise. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
quick O
snack O
in O
Oostende O
there O
are O
dozens O
of O
other O
addresses O
than O
the O
McDonalds!!!! B-TARGET

If O
necessary, O
go O
to O
the O
cages O
to O
get O
some O
fish O
hair O
or O
get O
a O
sandwich O
in O
the O
local O
slaughterhouses O
or O
the O
Panos! O

Very O
dirty, O
hardly O
any O
tables O
cleaned. O

The O
toilet B-TARGET
visit I-TARGET
(well, O
children O
can’t O
wait) O
is O
a O
hell! O

Warm, O
dirty O
floors, O
stinking, O
long O
row B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
waiting... I-TARGET

I’m O
not O
talking O
about O
McDonalds O
in O
general, O
but O
I O
think O
it’s O
a O
crime O
to O
go O
to O
the O
McDo B-TARGET
in O
Oostende!!!! O

It O
is O
never O
really O
clean O
and O
the O
floor B-TARGET
is O
always O
very O
sticky. O

You O
also O
have O
a O
lot O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
cold O
there O
or O
that O
there O
are O
machines B-TARGET
broken O
vb O
mc O
flurry. O

But O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly. O

Aperitif O
ordered O
-2 O
times O
rogge O
and O
half O
a O
liter O
of O
home O
wine. O

Aperitif O
OK O
- O
about O
7' O
afterwards O
the O
aperitif O
chips O
come...OK O
can O
happen. O

Then O
came O
the O
rogge: B-TARGET
so O
dehydrated O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
it O
from O
the O
grain. O

This O
was O
really O
not O
edible. O

When O
I O
made O
the O
comment, O
I O
was O
answered O
that O
the O
other O
side O
was O
less O
dry. O

I O
immediately O
requested O
the O
account. O

The O
only O
positive O
point: O
the O
rogge O
was O
not O
charged O
out O
of O
honest O
shame?? O

A O
meal B-TARGET
that O
is O
written O
in O
memory O
:( O

Upon O
entering O
already O
surprised O
that O
there O
is O
a O
fixed O
carpet O
in O
the O
whole O
restaurant. B-TARGET

After O
a O
while, O
I O
got O
the O
menu B-TARGET
card... I-TARGET
this O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
stickbook O
literally O
and O
figuratively. O

Prices O
adjusted O
with O
a O
sticker O
and O
the O
card B-TARGET
remains O
sticky O
to O
your O
hands. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
wine B-TARGET
card, I-TARGET
a O
gor O
ringmap O
that O
was O
completely O
shattered O
and O
kept O
sticking O
to O
your O
hands. O

We O
wisely O
did O
not O
look O
further. O

In O
the O
end, O
it O
was O
chosen O
purely O
for O
the O
filet. O

Was O
clearly O
2nd O
grade O
meat B-TARGET
and O
was O
barely O
hot, O
sauces B-TARGET
can O
be O
obtained O
in O
pots O
of O
the O
fry. O

The O
boys B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
service I-TARGET
try O
their O
best, O
but O
unfortunately O
they O
can’t O
save O
the O
suspicious O
calf. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
favorite O
of O
crawling O
and O
flying O
insects, O
then O
you O
will O
be O
attracted. O

Flies O
come O
with O
food, O
cracked O
back O
at O
the O
windows O
and O
Sebastian O
the O
spider O
in O
his O
enormous O
web O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
back O
window... O
all O
to O
admire O
inside. O

There O
was O
a O
moment O
of O
doubt O
between O
a O
restaurant O
a O
little O
further O
away O
where O
you O
could O
eat O
mustard O
in O
white O
wine O
sauce O
with O
cream O
and O
garlic O
for O
just O
over O
20 O
euros O
or O
La O
Sirene, O
where O
they O
offered O
mustard O
nature O
for O
13 O
euros. O

7 O
euros O
is O
a O
very O
big O
difference, O
so O
I O
chose O
La O
Sirene. O

I O
do O
not O
regret O
it. O

The O
meals B-TARGET
were O
delicious O
and O
for O
13 O
euros O
you O
can O
get O
them O
almost O
nowhere. O

Fries B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mayonnaise I-TARGET
were O
included O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
friendly. O

Time O
reserved O
for O
a O
group O
of O
30 O
people. O

But O
when O
we O
arrived O
there, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
closed, O
with O
vacation. O

Apparently O
no O
one O
thought O
of O
telling O
us O
about O
this. O

Apparently, O
there O
could O
not O
even O
be O
a O
simple O
"allo O
allo" O
out O
of O
it. O

Pleasure O
is O
different. O

The O
supply O
of O
beer B-TARGET
and O
others O
is O
very O
limited. O

The O
prices O
on O
the O
high O
side O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
slow. O

It O
can O
clearly O
be O
better. O

Want O

evening O
and O

It O
is O

to O

Allo O

In O
the O

with O
a O
nice O
terrace. B-TARGET

A O
beautiful O
place B-TARGET
on O
a O
beautiful O
Courtryks O
square. O

A O
beautiful O

We O
took O
the O
menu O
at O
36 O
euros O
with O
apples, O
sashimi O
of O
tuna, O
barley O
calf O
with O
forest O
champignons O
and O
coffee O
with O
a O
few O
mignardises. O

Everything O
very O
correct O
and O
delicious. O

Very O
good O
for O
this O
price. O

and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
quality O
of O
the O
served O
wines B-TARGET
per O
glass O
could O
be O
better. O

Go O
to O
dinner O
with O
two O
friends. O

We O
were O
well O
received O
and O
accompanied O
directly O
to O
the O
table. O

Very O
pleasant O
interior. B-TARGET

On O
the O
cricket O
board O
there O
were O
wine B-TARGET
suggestions I-TARGET
at O
attractive O
prices. O

We O
chose O
the O
tartar B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
kingkrab, I-TARGET
very O
delicious O
and O
freshly O
prepared. O

The O
fish O
soup O
and O
the O
homemade B-TARGET
Garnaalkrokette I-TARGET
these O
are O
truly O
authentically O
prepared. O

Then O
a O

perfectly O
baked. O

Risotto O
with O
fish. O

Very O
good O
risotto. B-TARGET

Finish O
the O
evening O
with O
an O
Irish O
coffee. O

Definitely O
recommend O
both O
interior, B-TARGET
service, B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

until O
again. O

What O
a O
disappointment. O

It O
all O
looks O
beautiful O
and O
promising O
but O
eating B-TARGET
is O
a O
disaster. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
far O
from O
warm, O
to O
discourage O
the O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
month. I-TARGET

The O
prelude B-TARGET
is O
full; O
flower O
sauce O
and O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
a O
mess. O

The O
custom B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
are O
poor, O
the O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
is O
not O
cooled, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
senseless O
and O
impersonal. O

What O
a O
waste O
of O
money. O

Never O
again. O

Together O
with O
my O
daughter O
I O
went O
to O
enjoy O
a O
evening O
at O
the O
restaurant O
St B-TARGET
Christophe I-TARGET
; O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
for O
both! O

The O
processing O
with O
Banyuls O
at O
the O
pre-trial O
was O
already O
a O
reminder O
of O
many O
holidays... O

Even O
the O
longest B-TARGET
could O
get O
our O
approval. O

A O
great O
bravo O
for O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

And O
the O
mango B-TARGET
tango I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
was O
a O
perfect O
ending O
of O
the O
dinner! O

Expert O
knowledge O
about O
the O
wines O
were O
given O
to O
us O
very O
kindly O
and O
the O
hospitality O
of O
the O
lady B-TARGET
is O
heartwarming! O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back! O

Few O
people O
on O
a O
summer O
Friday O
night. O

It O
was O
dining O
in O
the O
garden O
of O
this O
beautiful O
mansion. B-TARGET

Despite O
being O
very O
comfortable, O
the O
garden B-TARGET
needs O
some O
maintenance. O

Few O
people, O
and O
therefore O
very O
little O
staff. O

Must O
be O
able O
with O
three O
tables O
and O
yet O
the O
service B-TARGET
did O
not O
go O
really O
smoothly. O

The O
first O
half, O
the O
half, B-TARGET
was O
fine. O

The O
steak, B-TARGET
the O
steak, O
is O
very O
good. O

Dessert B-TARGET
was O
nothing. O

In O
the O
end, O
with O
everything O
on O
and O
on, O
yet O
expensive. O

A O
lady O
and O
a O
gentleman O
took O
care O
of O
the O
service. O

The O
lady B-TARGET
did O
well, O
the O
gentleman B-TARGET
was O
quite O
forced. O

I O
had O
lunch, O
it O
was O
Friday O
afternoon. O

Price/quality O
is O
very O
good. O

But O
it O
took O
quite O
a O
long O
time... O

From O
12h15 O
to O
15h15, O
i.e. O
three O
hours, O
is O
in O
my O
opinion O
out O
of O
proportion O
for O
a O
lunch O
menu. O

I’m O
glad O
we’ve O
been O
there O
once, O
but O
that’s O
still O
the O
case. O

Gastronomically O
well O
served O
in O
a O
beautiful O
old O
mansion. B-TARGET

Beautifully O
covered O
tables. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
at O
the O
level. O

The B-TARGET
price O
quality O
is O
very O
good. O

A O
real O
advisor. O

We O
ate O
lunch O
for O
19 O
euros. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

The O
platy B-TARGET
that O
followed O
was O
only O
very O
moderate: O
small O
and O
slightly O
too O
hard O
baked O
and O
for O
both O
of O
us O
we O
got O
one O
very O
chunky O
portion O
of O
fries. B-TARGET

There O
were O
questions O
but O
after O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
had O
already O
passed O
by O
10 O
times O
without O
looking O
up O
so O
we O
eventually O
got O
them O
when O
the O
rest O
of O
our O
plate O
was O
already O
empty. O

As O
a O
dessert O
we O
had O
a O
Dame B-TARGET
Blanche: I-TARGET
a O
bowl O
of O
half-melted O
ice O
with O
wax O
chocolate O
sauce O
and O
a O
large O
portion O
of O
cream B-TARGET
fraiche I-TARGET
from O
the O
spray, O
served O
in O
a O
glass. O

A O
dessert B-TARGET
from O
a O
lunch O
doesn’t O
have O
to O
be O
big O
but O
better O
served O
and O
preferably O
not O
in O
a O
glass O
would O
already O
help O
a O
lot. O

We O
come O
here O
very O
regularly O
and O
do O
not O
understand O
all O
the O
negative O
comments! O

But O
yes, O
that’s O
the O
time O
we O
live O
in, O
people O
have O
0 O
patience O
and O
are O
quickly O
shameless... O
thinking O
that O
a O
waitress O
is O
their O
little O
slave O
who O
just O
has O
to O
jump O
if O
they O
cut O
with O
their O
fingers! O

I O
call O
this O
bad O
people. O

Would O
like O
to O
see O
them O
do O
it O
themselves. O

At O
New B-TARGET
Havana I-TARGET
to O
knokke, O
you O
can O
eat O
good, O
yes O
prices O
are O
a O
little O
higher O
but O
euh... O
that O
money O
for O
so O
much O
Knokke. O

So O
if O
you O
don’t O
have O
that, O
you O
shouldn’t O
be O
in O
Knokke. O

We O
are O
always O
well O
served, O
and O
enjoy O
a O
drink B-TARGET
or O
good O
food. B-TARGET

I O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
point O
of O
the O

Let O
go O
of O
the O
nonsense O
of O
“chief O
Bellings” O
ahum... O

Top O
chef O
caught O
on O
doping. O

What O
a O
reference. O

People O
go O
and O
look O
for O
yourself. O

You O
can O
never O
do O
good O
for O
everyone. O

We O
can O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone. O

We O
go O
there O
every O
time O
we O
are O
at O
sea. O

Sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
before O
they O
arrive. O

Pancakes B-TARGET
are O
delicious! O

Chocolate B-TARGET
is O
not O
made O
by O
yourself. O

For O
the O
price O
you O
pay, O
I O
think O
you O
can O
get O
a O
home O
made! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
OK! O
(you O
can O
see O
with O
whom!) O

Good O
but O
not O
wonderful! O

It O
rains O
in O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

This O
is O
the O
dirtyest, O
worst O
restaurant B-TARGET
ever O
visited O
and O
we O
visit O
it O
a O
lot O
every O
year. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
taken O
from O
the O
Adam O
family. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
ruined. O

Also O
this O
year O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
fireworks O
festival, O
after O
years O
of O
tradition, O
go O
dining O
at O
Wim's O
again. O

We O
knew O
we O
had O
to O
book O
during O
the O
weekend, O
and O
our O
table O
overlooking O
the O
sea O
('t O
is O
to O
say O
on O
the O
3 O
rows O
of O
beach O
cabins) O
stood O
covered O
waiting O
for O
us. O

Those O
who O
did O
not O
reserve O
should O
not O
come O
in. O

We O
the O
delights O
that O
the O
sea O
had O
to O
offer. O

This O
has O
been O
and O
remains O
for O
years O
one O
of O
the O
best O
addresses O
on O
Knokke-Heist’s O
seaside. O

If O
we O
are O
back O
next O
year O
or O
earlier, O
we O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
come O
back. O

Excellent O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
sea O
views. O

We O
were O
welcomed O
by O
the O
host B-TARGET
who O
is O
clearly O
better O
surrounded O
than O
before. O

The O
selection B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
of O
excellent O
quality. O

We O
took O
the O
grilled O
mosquitoes O
with O
butter O
and O
smoked O
salmon O
as O
a O
preparation. O

Then O
came O
a O
generous O
portion O
of O
cabbage B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
young I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mousseline. I-TARGET

The O
postgrades B-TARGET
can O

that O
is O
a O

As O
old O
listeners, O
our O
hearts O
are O
very O
upset O
when O
we O
see O
how O
much O
money O
lies O
here O
on O
the O
street/in O
the O
pockets O
of O
customers. O

Running O
customers O
who O
have O
to O
wait O
with O
placing O
their O
order O
is O
rule O
1, O
leaving O
tables O
that O
are O
but O
not O
cleared O
rule O
2 O
and O
the O
biggest O
sin O
in O
the O
hospitality O
industry O
going O
back O
and O
forth O
with O
empty O
hands O
rule O
3. O

As O
a O
result, O
long O
waiting O
for O
you O
to O
order, O
long O
waiting O
for O
you O
to O
be O
served O
and O
after O
your O
drink O
to O
order O
a O
meal O
is O
almost O
an O
impossible O
task. O

But O
we O
succeeded! O

We O
were O
given O
moderate O
feed B-TARGET
at O
Knokke O
prices, O
which O
because O
the O
casino O
is O
next O
to O
it O
had O
gone O
over O
again. O

After O
going O
to O
the O
toilet, B-TARGET
it O
is O
not O
recommended. O

The O
rancid O
exhaust O
air O
strikes O
you O
on O
the O
throat O
and O
almost O
makes O
you O
sneeze. O

No, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
will O
not O
have O
a O
long O
life. O

We O
have O
known O
the O
Lodge O
for O
several O
years O
and O
therefore O
often O
visit O
(Diest, O
Aarschot, O
Zolder O
and O
Knokke). O

This O
time O
it O
was O
both O
food, B-TARGET
service B-TARGET
and O
restaurant B-TARGET
understated!!!! O

We O
had O
picked O
up O
garnals B-TARGET
where O
you O
had O
to O
look O
for O
the O
garnals. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
served O
with O
it O
was O
not O
fresh O
anymore O
and O
thrown O
on O
it, O
roasted B-TARGET
peterson I-TARGET
was O
also O
of O
a O
moderate O
level! O

The O
butter B-TARGET
served O
at O
our O
sea O
tune O
was O
full O
of O
burned O
pieces O
:-(. O

We O
sat O
outside O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
which O
was O
ok O
(although O
no O
tablespoons O
although O
we O
had O
booked). O

When O
you O
went O
to O
the O
toilet, O
the O
smell O
was O
already O
in O
you, O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
there O
had O
been O
no O
cushion O
for O
days! O

Also O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
the O
packs O
of O
butter O
and O
bread O
were O
on O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
service O
table. O
(it O
may O
have O
been O
busy O
but O
picking O
up O
something O
like O
this O
absolutely O
does O
not O
take O
time). O

There O
were O
3 O
room B-TARGET
servants I-TARGET
present O
and O
it O
was O
not O
busy, O
they O
had O
time O
to O
talk O
to O
each O
other O
so O
one O
could O
easily O
have O
cleaned O
up O
a O
little O
"dirt"! O

In O
addition, O
one O
of O
the O
room B-TARGET
servants I-TARGET
did O
not O
speak O
a O
word O
of O
Dutch O
or O
French!? O

This O
is O
NOT O
the O
service B-TARGET
we O
know O
from O
the O
other O
Lodge O
it O
was O
really O
understated!!!! O

Fireworks O
Festival O
– O
few O
restaurants, O
so O
first O
take O
where O
there O
is O
place. O

When O
we O
asked O
if O
there O
was O
room, O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
wanted O
to O
help O
us, O
but O
this O
was O
brutally O
pulled O
away O
by O
another O
waiter O
and O
left O
us O
standing. O

We O
then O
sat O
down O
and O
were O
helped O
by O
an O
untouched O
(old O
man B-TARGET
with O
grey O
hair) O
(= O
I O
will O
come O
back O
when O
I O
have O
time). O

After O
finally O
ordering, O
we O
saw O
waiters O
hanging O
(looking O
for O
the O
right O
tables), O
the O
old O
grey O
man O
was O
insulting O
everyone,..... O

We O
definitely O
saw O
16 O
tables O
run O
away O
because O
they O
were O
not O
served. O

After O
dinner O
we O
asked O
the O
old O
man B-TARGET
for O
another O
coffee O
and O
his O
answer O
was, O
“No!!!, O
I’m O
going O
to O
clean O
up O
all O
the O
tables O
(many) O
first O
and O
only O
then O
I’ll O
come O
back. O

We O
answered O
this O
back O
and O
said O
the O
extra O
loud O
what O
we O
thought O
of O
the O
service. O

Then O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
returned: O
“I O
want O
to O
offer O
my O
apology O
with O
2 O
free O
coffee O
(we O
had O
ordered O
3), O
but O
if O
you O
don’t O
like O
it, O
you O
just O
have O
to O
put O
on O
a O
shirt O
yourself” O
SPECIAL O
EXCUS!!!! O

At O
that O
moment, O
all O
the O
tables O
around O
us, O
which O
were O
not O
served, O
left O
and O
said O
he O
just O
had O
to O
look O
for O
another O
job. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
but O
due O
to O
the O
obscenity O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
(minutes O
of O
searching O
for O
the O
right O
table), O
the O
sauce O
was O
cold!!!! O

I O
will O
never O
return O
here O
again O
and O
I O
hope O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
(old O
man O
with O
grey O
hair) O
will O
be O
fired. O

The O
way O
he O
reacted O
to O
the O
customers O
was O
outrageous. O

Certainly O
for O
that O
price. O

If O
there O
were O
other O
restaurants O
free, O
we O
would O
have O
left O
immediately. O

But O
yes, O
you O
have O
to O
eat... O

This O
restaurant O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
list O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Ieper. O

I O
can’t O
imagine O
that O
there O
are O
no O
better O
restaurants O
in O
Ieper. O

Understand O
me O
well, O
it’s O
not O
bad, O
but O
not O
really O
great O
either. O

There O
are O
5 O
ladies B-TARGET
to O
serve, O
but O
when O
we O
came O
in O
there O
was O
nobody O
to O
ask O
if O
there O
was O
another O
table O
free. O

Later O
in O
the O
evening, O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
had O
finished O
her O
work, O
so O
she O
just O
started O
to O
squeeze O
out O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food O
between O
her O
teeth. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
nothing O
more O
than O
that. O

We O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal O
at O
Capella. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly, O
correct, O
helpful O
and O
very O
pleasant. O

We O
all O
had O
a O
3-course B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
which O
was O
really O
delicious. O

I O
ordered O
a O
wine, B-TARGET
which O
was O
delicious. O

As O
a O
tip, O
a O
dessert O
wine O
could O
also O
be O
given O
to O
the O
dessert, O
where O
everything O
was O
fine O
for O
each O
other. O

Pricing O
and O
quality O
can O
hardly O
be O
better. O

We O
have O
been O
here O
several O
times, O
or O
at O
least O
tried, O
with O
varying O
success. O

After O
several O
times O
waiting O
for O
our O
meal O
(+45min!!!), O
we O
last O
ordered O
video O
and O
stove O
meat. O

Even O
this O
took O
half O
an O
hour. O

The O
name O
restaurant O
is O
not O
worthy, O
serve O
only O
vacuum O
meals O
and O
service B-TARGET
is O
therefore O
understated. O

The O
garden O
could O
be O
nice O
if O
the O
grass O
was O
once O
mowed, O
the O
terrace O
even O
more O
pleasant O
if O
the O
tables O
were O
clean O
and O
it O
would O
make O
Tienen O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
richer O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
waiting O
times O
respectable. O

If O
I O
were O
to O
deal O
with O
my O
customers O
in O
this O
way, O
my O
C4 O
would O
be O
there O
soon! O

The O
garden B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
but O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
for O
you O
to O
have O
food B-TARGET
and O
it O
is O
only O
moderate O
in O
quality. O

If O
you O
just O
want O
to O
drink O
something O
it O
is O
recommended O
because O
the O
garden O
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
for O
the O
drink O
you O
should O
not O
wait O
long O

The O
garden B-TARGET
is O
great O
outside, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
too. O

The O
service B-TARGET
outside O
happens O
quite O
chaotic O
with O
its O
moments. O

Inside O
it O
goes O
smoother. O

For O
the O
third O
time O
this O
year, O
we O
have O
it O
again: O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
still O
enchanted, O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
stylish O
and O
enthusiastically O
widespread, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
flawless, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
of O
the O
sommelier O
is O
sublime. O

More O
we O
do O
not O
want O
to O
explain O
- O
let O
you O
be O
surprised O
by O
the O
paintings O
on O
your O
plate, O
almost O
too O
nice O
to O
eat O
but O
do O
it O
anyway O
- O
and O
enjoy O
the O
taste B-TARGET
sensations! I-TARGET

Our O
next O
reservation O
is O
already... O

From O
the O
amuse B-TARGET
gueule I-TARGET
to O
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
it’s O
incredible O
to O
enjoy O
all O
those O
flavors. O

The O
reception O
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
friendly O
and O
cared O
for. O

Of O
course, O
pm080 O
is O
absolutely O
right, O
but O
she O
still O
forgot O
about O
it. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
Stejn I-TARGET
also O
speaks O
Polish, O
which O
sometimes O
comes O
well O
from O
ps. O

Fair O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
best O
suited O
for O
in O
(space) O
company O
but O
now O
not O
directly O
the O
ideal O
opportunity O
for O
a O
romantic O
tête O
à O
tête O
with O
your O
loved O
one; O
a O
little O
no-nonsense O
and O
pretty O
fun, O
in O
addition O
a O
spacious O
card B-TARGET
and O
more O
than O
average O
delicious O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
a O
nice O
concept, O
a O
warm O
decor B-TARGET
and O
is O
not O
a O
tourist O
location. O

However, O
more O
customers O
are O
admitted O
to O
the O
restaurant O
than O
the O
service B-TARGET
can O
handle. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
who O
takes O
over O
the O
hall O
and/or O
keeps O
the O
overview. O

The O
regular O
service O
is O
complemented O
by O
students B-TARGET
(s) I-TARGET
who O
mainly O
walk O
a O
lot O
back O
and O
forth O
with O
nothing O
or O
one O
thing O
in O
the O
hand. O

-Friendly O
reception B-TARGET
and O
aperitif O
at O
the O
bar O
(at O
that O
time O
only O
1/3 O
of O
the O
guests O
were O
present) O

- O
ice B-TARGET
blocks I-TARGET
and O
garments B-TARGET
are O
taken O
unhygienically O
with O
bare O
hands. O

There O
is O
no O
drink O
card O
or O
wine O
card O
on O
the O
table. O

After O
a O
second O
question, O
the O
original O
wine B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
arrives. O

-Wine O
ordering O
is O
difficult, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
says O
she O
has O
no O
time O
and O
so O
immediately O
comes O
back, O
but O
she O
forgets O
this. O

After O
a O
while, O
we O
talk O
to O
another O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
has O
the O
time O
to O
remember O
the O
two O
words O
needed O
to O
express O
our O
choice. O

The O
snack O
had O
already O
been O
cleaned O
up O
and O
it O
was O
pre-cooked O
on O
one O
snack O
after O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
bottle O
of O
delicious O
Pouilly B-TARGET
Fuissé I-TARGET
on O
the O
table. O

Since O
we O
had O
taken O
the O
aperitif O
at O
the O
bar, O
we O
stood O
"dry" O
all O
that O
time. O

The O
maid B-TARGET
who O
didn’t O
have O
time O
stood O
between O
fries O
at O
the O
table O
where O
a O
member O
of O
her O
family O
was O
sitting O
as O
a O
customer. O

The O
snack B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
sour O
fresh. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

The O
pre-cooked, B-TARGET
extra I-TARGET
soft I-TARGET
smoked I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
was O
standard O
wholesale O
quality. O

The O
fat O
seed O
near O
the O
tail O
of O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
that O
hardens O
when O
smoking O
was O
not O
cut O
off O
by O
the O
kitchen. O

The O
fondue B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
fries B-TARGET
fresh, O
the O
sauces B-TARGET
industrial. O

It O
is O
asked O
if O
there O
should O
be O
some O
more O
fries, O
which O
soon O
follows O
another O
bowl. O

A O
little O
later, O
they O
ask O
if O
there O
is O
any O
more O
meat; O
“Please,” O
we O
answer; O
“a O
half O
plate O
is O
enough.” O

17 O
minutes O
later, O
the O
servant O
comes O
to O
clean O
up. O

“We O
are O
still O
waiting O
for O
meat,” O
we O
replied. O

Then, O
through O
someone O
else O
from O
the O
operation, O
the O
communication O
goes O
to O
the O
kitchen O
a O
second O
time. O

Nonchalance O
of O
the O
kitchen O
or O
an O
unclear O
order O
17 O
minutes O
earlier O
from O
the O
operation O
to O
the O
kitchen? O

The O
chef O
shoots O
himself O
at O
his O
cutting O
machine O
and O
the O
meat O
follows. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
are, O
of O
course, O
cold O
in O
the O
meantime, O
but O
we O
don’t O
ask O
for O
hot O
anymore, O
who O
knows O
when O
we O
get O
them. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
overcrowded O
compared O
to O
the O
room. O

The O
hall B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
left O
to O
their O
fate: O
pumping O
or O
sucking. O

The O
stress O
of O
the O
hall B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
and O
the O
unnecessary O
(inefficient) O
pressure O
going O
back O
and O
forth O
radiates O
on O
the O
customers O
and O
determines O
the O
atmosphere O
in O
the O
case. B-TARGET

Enjoying O
here O
is O
difficult. O

The O
acoustic B-TARGET
is O
a O
sensitive O
point. O

Starting O
with O
a O
small O
customer O
group, O
you O
need O
to O
raise O
your O
voice O
to O
be O
able O
to O
have O
a O
clear O
conversation O
with O
your O
partner. O

An O
acoustic O
ceiling, O
3D O
tiles... O
as O
a O
solution? O

If O
coverings O
are O
washed O
out O
several O
times O
during O
the O
service O
and O
then O
thrown O
back O
into O
the O
appropriate O
boxes O
and, O
in O
addition, O
all O
the O
laundry O
is O
stacked O
smoothly O
onto O
each O
other, O
this O
all O
creates O
unnecessary O
noise O
throughout O
the O
entire O
hall. O

In O
the O
absence O
of O
an O
e-mail O
address O
on O
the O
website, O
I O
cannot O
pass O
this O
feedback O
directly O
to O
the O
owner, O
but O
I O
must O
post O
it O
here... O

When O
I O
entered O
the O
restaurant, O
they O
spoke O
to O
me O
in O
French. O

When O
I O
asked O
if O
they O
spoke O
Dutch, O
the O
answer O
was O
no. O

So O
my O
hunger O
was O
over O
and O
I O
turned O
to O
the O
right. O

I O
read O
the O
negative O
reviews O
on O
Tripadvisor O
when O
we O
were O
already O
sitting O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
Holiday O
restaurant O
and O
was O
a O
little O
scared O
VOO O
what O
would O
come... O

In O
the O
end, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised, O
we O
had O
a O
nice O
service O
of O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
ok, O
I O
took O
the O
fish B-TARGET
suggestion I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
day I-TARGET
and O
this O
was O
a O
correct O
dish O
for O
a O
correct O
price. O

No O
culinary O
highlights O
but O
for O
that O
you O
have O
other O
establishments O
in O
Nieuwpoort. O

I O
think O
the O
negative O
criticisms O
are O
exaggerated. O

We O
both O
ate O
pizza B-TARGET
frutti I-TARGET
di I-TARGET
mare I-TARGET
and O
this O
was O
best O
in O
terms O
of O
price/quality. O

A O
lot O
of O
cheese, B-TARGET
not O
a O
dried O
crust B-TARGET
as O
you O
often O
encounter, O
actually O
quite O
airy. O

At O
the O
service, B-TARGET
however, O
there O
was O
someone O
who O
could O
not O
speak O
a O
word O
Dutch, O
which O
I O
think O
for O
Nieuwpoort O
can O
absolutely O
not. O

We O
asked O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
olives O
at O
our O
aperitif, O
but O
that O
was O
not O
possible. O

With O
almost O
every O
Italian O
you O
get O
this O
standard O
on O
the O
table! O

So O
not O
here... O

What O
we O
got O
was O
delicious. O

The O
Court B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Heusden I-TARGET
is O
in O
itself O
a O
special O
location. O

It O
really O
looks O
like O
a O
cafe O
at O
the O
entrance O
– O
and O
that’s O
also O
because O
you O
can O
just O
drink O
or O
eat O
there. O

Behind O
it O
is O
the O
restaurant. O

And O
at O
the O
restaurant O
is O
a O
large O
terrace. O

Walk O
through O
the O
cafe O
to O
the O
restaurant. O

And O
that O
is O
very O
pleasantly O
arranged! O

Abdel B-TARGET
is O
top: O
he O
is O
very O
good O
at O
cooking O
and O
we O
especially O
think O
he O
is O
a O
master O
in O
preparing O
wild. O

So O
in O
the O
wild O
season: O
everyone O
there! O

In O
the O
summer O
there O
is O
a O
large O
terrace O
with O
a O
garden. O

We O
love O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
especially O
because O
of O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
kindness O
of O
Abdel. B-TARGET

We O
especially O
love O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
winter O
months. O

Monthly O
menu: O
The O
“fine B-TARGET
tasting I-TARGET
table” I-TARGET
consisted O
of O
a O
1 O
square O
centimeter O
toast O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
pasta O
on O
and O
something O
that O
resembled O
onion O
candy. O

The O
butter B-TARGET
we O
received O
with O
the O
3 O
pieces O
of O
bread O
(for O
2 O
people) O
had O
the O
expiration O
date O
12/12/13 O
(almost O
a O
month O
on O
date) O

The O
carpacio B-TARGET
(tataki O
on O
the O
menu) O
was O
waterproof O
and O
uninspired. O

The O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

The O
wines B-TARGET
can O
only O
be O
ordered O
per O
glass O
or O
half O
a O
liter??? O

It O
could O
be O
ordered O
by O
bottle. O

So O
I O
assume O
that O
the O
“better O
wines” O
come O
out O
of O
a O
vase? O

The O
room O
was O
full O
of O
people O
who O
came O
to O
eat O
with O
the O
Grouponbon. O

Their O
menu, O
which O
cost O
about O
half O
of O
ours, O
looked O
much O
better. O

The O
situation O
lacks O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
we O
have O
absolutely O
no O
good O
feeling O
after O
this O
meal. O

There O
are O
many O
rests O
in O
Destelbergen O
and O
Heusden O
with O
a O
much O
better O
price-quality O
ratio. O

There O
is O
still O
a O
lot O
of O
work... O

We O
had O
chosen O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
Groupon O
voucher. O

We O
were O
disappointed O
when O
we O
arrived. O

It O
was O
just O
a O
cafe O
where O
you O
were O
going O
to O
drink O
something O
and O
it O
was O
not O
romantically O
furnished O
there. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
well O
presented O
on O
the O
board. O

Of O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
however, O
there O
was O
no O
smile. O

I O
have O
visited O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
5 O
times O
and O
never O
had O
a O
disappointment. O

(Otherwise O
you O
will O
not O
come O
back) O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
always O
welcoming O
and O
the O
price/quality O
is O
excellent. O

This O
weekend O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
embedded O
in O
the O
wild O
season. O

The O
amuse B-TARGET
is O
already O
surprising O
and O
a O
forerunner O
of O
a O
promising O
menu. O

Carpaccio B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
evergreen, I-TARGET
patrijs B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
beet I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
forest I-TARGET
champignons I-TARGET
are O
surprising O
combinations. O

Add O
a O
closer O
with O
vanilla O
ice O
and O
strawberries O
and O
the O
evening O
can O
not O
be O
broken. O

5 O
courses O
for O
45.00 O
euros O
is O
a O
fair O
price O
for O
a O
forward O
menu. B-TARGET

Booking O
with O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
was O
always O
successful. O

Agree O
that O
a O
smulbox O
for O
the O
little O
ones O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
of O
fast O
food, O
but O
they O
just O
like O
it. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
the O
top O
but O
young O
talent O
deserves O
and O
backbone. O

We O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
regularly O
because O
you O
will O
find O
the O
best O
pizza B-TARGET
in O
the O
area. O

Mateo B-TARGET
was O
voted O
the O
best O
pizza O
baker O
in O
Eastern O
Flanders. O

We O
also O
love O
the O
comfortable O
family O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

There O
is O
an O
excellent O
wine B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
that O
is O
regularly O
renewed. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
also O
changes O
regularly. O

However, O
we O
try O
to O
avoid O
the O
weekend O
because O
it O
can O
be O
quite O
busy. O

Everyone O
is O
struggling O
to O
please O
the O
customers, O
but O
one O
cannot O
do O
more O
than O
is O
humanly O
possible. O

Victims O
of O
their O
own O
success. O

Reserve O
and O
inform O
is O
the O
message. O

Nothing O
warm, O
very O
kind! O

Just O
impolite O
service. B-TARGET

As O
if O
everything O
was O
against O
her. O

I O
hope O
this O
was O
a O
moment O
recording O
(bad O
day) O

In O
any O
case, O
we O
will O
never O
return O
here. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
bad, O
but O
that O
couldn’t O
make O
up O
the O
hostess’s B-TARGET
ruthlessness. O

There O
are O
plenty O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Destelbergen O
where O
they O
don’t O
work O
against O
their O
will. O

At O
first, O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
had O
some O
“threshold O
fear” O
of O
entering O
here, O
as O
the O
interior B-TARGET
looked O
somewhat O
messy. O

But O
we O
overcame O
our O
fear O
and O
got O
the O
surprise O
of O
our O
lives! O

We O
were O
very O
welcomed O
and O
felt O
at O
home O
in O
this O
lovely O
family O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Not O
at O
all O
chic O
or O
so, O
rather O
simple, O
you O
waver O
in O
an O
Italian O
home O
room... O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
I O
have O
never O
felt O
Italy O
so O
close O
as O
in O
the O
Etna. B-TARGET

The O
chef B-TARGET
has O
won O
awards O
for O
"Best O
Pizzaiolo O
of O
Flanders" O
and O
is O
very O
proud O
of O
it. O

The O
pictures O
and O
testimonials O
hang O
on O
the O
wall. O

My O
best O
experience O
so O
far O
with O
the O
authentic O
Italian O
cuisine O
in O
our O
Belgian O
country. O

The O
price O
is O
also O
very O
reasonable. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
here, O
sure O
to O
know!!! O

Super O
delicious O
pasta B-TARGET
and O
pizza! B-TARGET

The O
chef, O
Mateo O
is O
an O
Italian. O

Welcome, O
well O
to O
book O
in O
advance. O

The O
price O
is O
average. O

Also O
the O
formula B-TARGET
'pizza I-TARGET
party' I-TARGET
is O
a O
shot O
in O
the O
rose!! O

In O
the O
summer O
large O
sun B-TARGET
terrace. I-TARGET

I O
had O
asked O
for O
a O
steak, B-TARGET
but O
this O
was O
medium O
to O
bien O
cuit. O

When O
I O
made O
a O
comment O
about O
this, O
I O
just O
got O
the O
same O
meat O
back O
with O
the O
notification O
that O
I O
was O
wrong. O

There O
is O
very O
little O
creative O
kitchen. B-TARGET

No O
to O
recommend. O

Sunday O
30 O
March, O
beautiful O
weather O
so O
terrace O
on O
the O
way: O
Really O
many O
customers O
and O
enough O
staff B-TARGET
who, O
however, O
were O
not O
interested O
in O
serving O
the O
people. O

We O
spent O
a O
thick O
half-hour O
there O
trying O
to O
attract O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
who O
walked O
past O
without O
taking O
any O
orders. O

In O
the O
end, O
we O
were O
hungry O
and O
thirsty O
and O
went O
back. O

I O
have O
never O
experienced O
such O
an O
unscrupulous O
and O
uninterested O
service B-TARGET
anywhere O
before. O

Just O
incomprehensible. O

They O
never O
see O
us O
there O
again. O

"The O
youngest O
telg O
"has O
as O
its O
main O
asset O
the O
beautiful O
garden B-TARGET
where O
it O
is O
good O
for O
families O
with O
children O
and O
larger O
groups, O
had O
it O
not O
been O
that O
the O
current O
management O
has O
drastically O
changed O
the O
concept. O

On O
Sunday O
afternoon O
there O
is O
"animation" O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
"dinner O
show", O
an O
arrangement O
that O
costs O
$70,-, O
but O
then O
you O
will O
get O
entertainment O
from O
the O
beating O
gods O
à O
la O
Frank O
Galan, O
Danny O
Fabri, O
Paul O
Severs O
and O
tutti O
quanti. O

Suitable O
for O
a O
limited O
niche O
audience. O

We O
thought O
calmly O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
something O
in O
the O
garden B-TARGET
(then O
you O
pay O
the O
€70,- O
not O
and O
you O
can O
only O
order O
from O
the O
snacks O
card) O
but O
also O
there O
the O
decibels O
are O
generously O
sent O
to O
you O
(poor O
neighbors!). O

We O
ate O
fast O
and O
without O
taste O
and O
made O
us O
go O
away O
again. O

You O
love O
Flemish O
and O
other O
beaters: O
go O
for O
it, O
don't O
pay O
$70,- O
and O
put O
yourself O
in O
the O
garden; O
you O
don't O
like O
it, O
just O
stay O
away. O

The O
new O
building O
looks O
like O
a O
public O
swimming O
pool O
or O
gym. O

How O
does O
it O
come O
to O
mind O
to O
renew O
a O
cause O
of O
tradition O
and O
nostalgia O
in O
such O
a O
terrible O
way! O

Happiness O
is O
miles O
away! O

You O
can O
quietly O
eat O
and O
drink O
here, O
the O
prices O
are O
slightly O
higher O
than O
normal O
but O
you O
get O
value O
for O
your O
money. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
playground O
for O
the O
children O
and O
in O
the O
summer O
it O
is O
also O
pleasant O
to O
stay O
here. O

There O
is O
no O
problem O
getting O
a O
meal O
at O
this O
restaurant/café O
around O
21:30. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
smooth O
and O
happened O
quickly. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
seating O
in O
this O
establishment, O
yet O
one O
manages O
to O
get O
almost O
all O
the O
seats O
occupied O
even O
on O
a O
day O
of O
the O
week. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
excellent! O

Great O
organization, B-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
variation, O
for O
everyone. O

Friendly O
operation, B-TARGET
cozy O
interior B-TARGET
and O
all O
that O
in O
a O
beautiful O
green O
location. B-TARGET

We O
would O
love O
to O
come O
back O
again! O

Very O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
fantastic O
area B-TARGET
in O
the O
woods, O
ideal O
as O
a O
cycling O
stop O
where O
there O
is O
good O
food, B-TARGET
but O
also O
the O
trouble O
to O
just O
go O
for O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
cosy O
terrace O
next O
to O
the O
gempemolen O

Very O
nice, O
friendly O
reception, B-TARGET
super O
good O

helpful O

perfect O

Beautiful O

very O
balanced, O
very O
well-trained O
and O
friendly O

Excellent O
meals B-TARGET
and O
excellent O

but O
expensive. O

We O
have O
eaten O
there O
several O
times. O

Enjoy O
it O
again O
and O
again!! O

Super O
friendly O
hostess. B-TARGET

Fantastic O
food! B-TARGET

A O
real O
taste O
festival! O

So O
far, O
we O
have O
not O
found O
any O
other O
restaurant O
that O
can O
tip O
on O
this! O

Unfriendly O
people B-TARGET
– O
crazy O
crazy O
– O
worst O
food B-TARGET
ever O
– O
don’t O
go O
there!!!! O

And O
then O
the O
people O
in O
the O
hospital O
complain... O

as O
part O
of O
a O
flairbon O
we O
reserved O
at O
"de O
mein" O
the O
soup B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
asperges I-TARGET
was O
delicious O
but O
no O
bread, O
butter O
served. O

The O
beef B-TARGET
brochure I-TARGET
was O
rainy O
and O
tough O
(all O
5 O
blocks O
on O
the O
spies) O
and O
ate O
like O
a O
chewing O
gum. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
(salm) O
ate O
good, O
but O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
asked O
for O
a O
little O
butter O
sauce O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
replied, O
"Sauce O
is O
over. O

At O
the O
third B-TARGET
time, I-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
cream O
brullée O
in O
the O
offer O
while O
this O
was O
indicated O
in O
the O
voucher. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
coffee. O

You O
guess O
the O
answer: O
“Isn’t O
there?” O

The O
night O
that O
followed O
was O
hell. O

My O
wife O
surrendered O
the O
whole O
night O
and O
diarrhea. O

So O
the O
final O
conclusion: O
still O
paid O
too O
much O
and O
arrived O
at O
18 O
a.m. O
and O
left O
at O
21.15. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
also O
not O
too O
friendly O
and O
very O
attentive. O

After O
noted O
reservation O
(according O
to O
vivabox) O
they O
never O
wanted O
to O
serve O
us, O
and O
this O
after O
one O
and O
a O
half O
hours O
of O
waiting. O

Congratulations O
and O
success O
in O
the O
future. O

It O
is O
a O
shame O
what O
they O
serve. O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
so O
badly. O

I O
got O
steppe B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
that O
tss O
grilled O
for O
a O
while. O

It O
is O
not O
even O
eligible O
for O
freeze. O

Just O
stop O
with O
this. O

In O
my O
experience, O
it O
was O
reserved O
for O
lunch O
outside O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
inside O
in O
a O
separate O
room. O

It O
was O
loud O
and O
noisy. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
but O
I O
would O
prefer O
a O
more O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
on O
a O
beautiful O
spring O
day. O

A O
menu O
is O
arranged O
for O
a O
group O
of O
10 O
people. O

Correct O
price O
for O
a O
3-course B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
(every O
fish O
or O
meat), O
including O
drinks O
and O
aperitifs. O

Quality O
in O
order, O
to O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
the O
participants. O

thank O
you! O

Through O
acquaintances, O
we O
were O
advised O
to O
go O
to O
the O
tables. O

We O
went O
here O
for O
dinner O
on O
Valentine’s O
Day. O

There O
was O
just O
a O
table O
of O
2 O
free O
and O
ordered O
the O
Valentine O
menu. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
really O
good O
and O
we O
knew O
we O
should O
come O
here O
more O
often. O

Really O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
out O
to O
eat. O

In O
addition, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
there O
was O
a O
nice O
Valentine O
gift. O

Reserve O
a O
hopeless O
case. O

2x O
reserved, O
2x O
not O
on O
the O
list!!!! O

Social O
Deal O
confirmation O
email O
showed, O
come, O
give O
but, O
and O
put O
you! O

Welcome O
to! O

Forget O
it... O

A O
half O
hour O
wait O
for O
the O
first O
tapas. O

It O
was O
reasonable, O
but O
to O
serranoham B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
can O
not O
counter O
much. O

Wait O
another O
1/2 O
hour O
for O
another O
miniature O
portion. B-TARGET

Tapas O
eat O
as O
much O
as O
you O
want. O

They O
decide O
how O
much O
you O
eat, O
if O
you’re O
lucky O
you O
get O
4x3 O
servings, O
if O
they O
don’t O
want O
it, O
you’ll O
have O
to O
do O
it O
with O
less! O

The O
maid B-TARGET
did O
her O
best, O
but O
the O
basin B-TARGET
(?) O
should O
follow O
a O
course O
of O
welcome, O
bah O
bah. O

Can'so-called' O
not O
well O
Dutch, O
What O
a O
laugh, O
was O
complaining O
to O
acquaintances O
about O
Social O
Deal O
and O
the O
influx O
of O
guests O
who O
brought O
this O
formula O
with O
it, O
in O
perfect O
Dutch... O

It’s O
been O
a O
year O
now O
and O
I’m O
curious O
how O
it O
will O
look O
next O
year. O

Don’t O
think O
that O
many O
people O
go O
for O
a O
second O
time, O
which O
is O
ultimately O
the O
intention. O

This O
is O
a O
missed O
opportunity, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
cook. B-TARGET

With O
the O
whole O
family O
going O
to O
eat O
at O
19:00, O
at O
19.30 O
we O
got O
the O
drink O
card, O
at O
19.40 O
we O
had O
to O
pass O
the O
order O
for O
the O
meal O
only. O

None O
of O
the O
tapas O
we O
ordered O
came O
on O
the O
table O
at O
the O
same O
time O
and O
there O
were O
also O
a O
few O
tapas O
that O
we O
had O
passed. O

Operation B-TARGET
very O
bad, O
while O
there O
was O
not O
much O
clandition. O

Everything O
was O
too O
much O
for O
them. O

We O
could O
have O
eaten O
2 O
hours O
unlimited O
tapas O
but O
at O
20.55 O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
said O
the O
kitchen O
was O
closed O
at O
21.00. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
bad, O
we O
could O
have O
even O
better O
go O
to O
a O
fridge!! O

There O
is O
no O
recommendation!! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
but O
the O
discomfort B-TARGET
terrible, O
no O
explanation O
and O
with O
pain O
and O
difficulty O
can O
order O
2x O
(which O
the O
lady B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
service I-TARGET
also O
looked O
impatiently O
at O
her O
watch) O
if O
you O
swung O
/ O
cried O
out O
or O
somehow O
wanted O
to O
draw O
her O
attention O
she O
seemed O
to O
ignore O
this. O

It O
was O
a O
pity O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good! O

First O
attempted O
months O
to O
book O
with O
the O
voucher O
of O
social O
deal, O
via O
website O
social O
deal O
not O
possible, O
then O
tried O
by O
phone, O
was O
very O
ruthlessly O
blown O
down O
that O
I O
only O
had O
to O
book O
with O
computer, O
tried O
again, O
no O
possibility, O
after O
written O
complaint O
at O
social O
deal O
then O
finally O
hit O
a O
reservation.... O
what O
we O
saw O
there... O
very O
dirty, O
bad O
tastes, B-TARGET
terrible O
service, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
on O
the O
map O
were O
suddenly O
served O
with O
other O
vegetables, O
and O
yet... O
staff B-TARGET
"sitting O
or O
standing" O
there O
enough, O
but O
they O
do O
not O
come O
from O
their O
place.... O

No O
more...! O

On O
Sunday, O
four O
adults O
will O
eat O
breakfast O
for O
the O
third O
time. O

Really O
a O
recommendation. O

We O
ate O
the O
luxury B-TARGET
breakfast I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
really O
luxury. O

Very O
delicious O
sandwiches B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
cakes, I-TARGET
plenty O
of O
bread, B-TARGET
very O
delicious O
cheese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese O
and O
delicious O
coffee, B-TARGET
the O
tea B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
milk I-TARGET
are O
definitely O
recommended. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
you O
have O
breakfast O
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting. B-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
return O
to O
this O
case B-TARGET
in O
Damme. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
things O
where O
the O
customer O
is O
the O
king. O

We O
had O
a O
house O
nearby O
without O
breakfast. O

By O
the O
reviews O
here O
on O
the O
site O
for O
this O
matter O
chosen O
to O
go O
for O
breakfast. O

And O
what O
a O
disgrace. O

As O
soon O
as O
your O
door O
opens, O
the O
delicious O
pastries B-TARGET
will O
jump O
in. O

We O
chose O
a O
luxurious B-TARGET
breakfast I-TARGET
for O
$10,-pp O
and O
what O
a O
party O
it O
was. O

Two O
sandwiches O
to O
choose O
from. O

Hard, O
soft, O
multi-green... O
just O
name O
it. O

And O
also O
a O
choice B-TARGET
from O
a O
"coffee O
bread"..or O
a O
real O
coffee O
bread O
but O
also O
croissants O
(with O
or O
without O
chocolate) O
or O
other O
delicious O
sandwiches. B-TARGET

Also O
a O
glass O
of B-TARGET
orange I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
(not O
fresh O
but O
still O
very O
delicious) O
coffee B-TARGET
as O
much O
as O
you O
want. O

A O
fresh O
cooked O
egg, B-TARGET
standard O
perfectly O
softly O
cooked, O
on O
request O
slightly O
harder. O

The O
package O
consists O
of O
slices O
of O
ham O
and O
cheese. O

Nutella O
and O
Speculoos. O

All O
in O
all... O
enough. O

More O
than O
enough. O

It O
was O
so O
nice O
that O
we O
just O
got O
back O
here O
the O
second O
day. O

Super O
friendly O
woman B-TARGET
behind O
the O
bench O
with O
whom O
we O
have O
had O
whole O
conversations, O
open O
and O
honest! O

For O
the O
complete O
picture... O

A O
real O
advisor. O

Good O
thing B-TARGET
and O
good O
food B-TARGET

They O
are O
served O
quickly. O

The O
scampies B-TARGET
doable I-TARGET
are O
great. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
garnal I-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
are O
even O
better O
than O
in O
most O
restaurants O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
definitely O
not O
recommended O
for O
a O
fun O
dinner O
out. O

Since O
we O
didn’t O
feel O
good O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
we O
actually O
found O
it O
inappropriate O
to O
leave O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
we O
didn’t O
order O
pre-dish. O

We O
were O
the O
only O
guests O
at O
the O
time. O

The O
operation B-TARGET
was O
moderate, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
was O
sitting O
behind O
his O
PC O
all O
the O
time O
after O
preparing O
the O
main O
dish. O

The O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

After O
choosing O
a O
post-trial, B-TARGET
which O
collapsed, O
we O
eventually O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
bill O
in O
cash. O

Once O
but O
never O
again! O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
owner B-TARGET
arrogant, O
but O
he O
also O
blames O
his O
customers! O

Both O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
hotel O
are O
to O
be O
avoided O
like O
the O
plague! O

In O
the O
rooms O
there O
is O
fish O
smell O
and O
kitchen O
noise. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
moderate O
and O
not O
worth O
its O
price. O

We O
went O
here O
to O
eat O
with O
another O
couple O
and O
immediately O
chose O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
real O
Belgian. O

Tomato O
garlic-slip O
tongues-Dame O
Blanche: O
it O
didn’t O
look O
bad. O

And O
it O
was O
not O
bad O
if O
you O
opted O
for O
a O
café-restaurant O
somewhere O
in O
the O
center O
of O
a O
city. O

But O
if O
your O
boss O
deliberately O
chooses O
a O
restaurant O
then O
the O
whole B-TARGET
should O
be O
a O
little O
more O
sophisticated O
and O
the O
entourage B-TARGET
a O
little O
more O
cozy. O

Repeat O
the O
mistakes O
of O
the O
past? O

The O
garlics B-TARGET
were O
delicious, O
the O
tongue B-TARGET
was O
well O
baked O
but O
for O
that O
price O
the O
presentation B-TARGET
could O
be O
a O
lot O
better. O

Now O
it O
all O
seemed O
to O
be O
sad O
and O
maybe O
it O
was, O
the O
chef B-TARGET
(patron) O
we O
regularly O
saw O
sitting O
behind O
his O
computer O
at O
a O
table O
in O
the O
restaurant O
to O
great O
annoyances O
from O
our O
partners O
who O
were O
constantly O
watching. O

The O
unfriendliness O
of O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
both O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
during O
our O
whole O
meal O
was O
quite O
annoying O
and O
also O
the O
clicking O
of O
her O
shoes O
enormously O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
customers O
present O
so O
that O
there O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
relaxed O
enjoying O
the O
food. O

When O
we O
checked O
out O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
we O
could O
only O
pay O
in O
cash, O
because O
their O
device O
was O
supposedly O
broken. O

So O
again O
and O
again O
to O
a O
ATM O
to O
close O
this O
less O
pleasant O
evening. O

We O
no O
longer O
dare O
to O
take O
friends O
with O
us. O

I O
everything O
on O
the B-TARGET
south I-TARGET
side. I-TARGET

the O
courts B-TARGET
are O
TOP, O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
EXCELLENT, O
the O
custom B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
SUPER, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
very O
warm O
and O
cozy O
and O
the O
hostess, B-TARGET
incredibly O
CHARMANT, O
it O
was O
enjoying O
in O
the O
greatest O
sense O
of O
the O
word! O

A O
better O
choice O
could O
not O
have O
been O
made. O

We O
chose O
the O
menu O
and O
the O
custom O
wines. O

Four O
courses, B-TARGET
large O
enough O
portions O
and O
a O
streling O
for O
the O
flavours. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
SU-PER! O

The O
friendly O
and O
smooth O
service B-TARGET
and O
also O
the O
explanation O
at O
the O
dishes O
made O
this O
evening O
unforgettable! O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back! O

very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
perfect O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
relentless O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
hostess B-TARGET
gives O
you O
a O
warm O
welcome: O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back!! O

Very O
well O
eaten. O

I O
said O
in O
advance O
that O
I O
did O
not O
eat O
fish. O

I O
got O
two O
well-adjusted O
dishes. O

There O
was O
a O
supplement O
that O
was O
not O
discussed. O

That O
was O
a O
minus... O

Atmosphere, B-TARGET
wine B-TARGET
and O
dishes B-TARGET
top! O

We O
ate O
a O
3-course O
menu. O

Everything O
was O
fine O
and O
cared O
for. O

A O
beautiful O
presentation. B-TARGET

Pleasant O
and O
beautiful O
interior. B-TARGET

The O
owner B-TARGET
provides O
a O
nice O
reception O
and O
is O
very O
attentive. O

We O
spent O
a O
day O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

A O
plus O
for O
the O
location, B-TARGET
because O
you O
are O
just O
outside O
the O
crowd O
of O
the O
coast O
in O
the O
cozy O
center O
of O
De O
Haan. O

Parking O
is O
no O
problem. O

We O
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
welcomed O
by O
the O
owner B-TARGET
who O
could O
immediately O
give O
tips O
around O
the O
best O
places O
on O
the O
terrace. O

The O
monthly B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
great. O

My O
dish B-TARGET
based I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
tomato, I-TARGET
mozarella I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
basil I-TARGET
was O
surprising, O
fresh O
and O
contemporary. O

A O
real O
taste O
bomb. O

The O
carpaccio B-TARGET
on O
the O
other O
side O
fresh O
and O
flinterdun, O
but O
to O
my O
husband’s O
taste O
provided O
a O
little O
too O
much O
olive O
oil. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
top! O

The O
main B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
were O
once O
again O
very O
delicious O
and O
tasty. O

The O
cabbage B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
black I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
delicious! O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
sort O
of O
soup O
based O
on O
fruits O
and O
vegetables O
and O
less O
our O
thing. O

But O
in O
general, O
lovely O
getafeld O
in O
a O
very O
friendly O
and O
warm O
frame! B-TARGET

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
beautiful O
decor B-TARGET
and O
loose O
friendly O
reception. B-TARGET

What O
we O
got O
on O
the O
board O
was O
of O
a O
very O
high O
level. O

Not O
what O
you O
expect O
in O
a O
small O
polder O
village. O

You O
clearly O
notice O
that O
there O
are O
super-high-educated O
but O
simple O
sympathetic O
people B-TARGET
working O
here. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
here O
because O
we O
are O
curious O
about O
other O
dishes O
they O
make O
on O
the O
table. O

A O
recommended O
one! O

The O
chef B-TARGET
enchantes O
the O
flavors O
on O
your O
plate, O
while O
Tine B-TARGET
serves O
you O
with O
a O
smile. O

The O
choice O
between O
2 O
menus O
is O
so O
difficult O
because O
everything O
is O
delicious. O

This O
is O
the O
third O
time O
we O
have O
eaten O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Every O
time O
from O
A O
to O
Z. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
smooth O
and O
pleasant. O

Tinne B-TARGET
always O
surprises. O

All O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
at O
a O
very O
high O
level. O

Very O
nice O
creations O
from O
the O
chef B-TARGET
who O
works O
with O
fresh O
products. B-TARGET

Just O
the O
best O
restaurant. B-TARGET

It O
is O
worth O
at O
least O
one O
star. O

Excellent O
food, B-TARGET
great O
environment, B-TARGET
excellent O
service B-TARGET
but O
one O
minus. O

Lunch B-TARGET
is O
always O
listed O
at O
$37 O
and O
they O
counted O
$42 O
with O
the O
reason O
that O
it O
was O
a O
Sunday O
(July O
21). O

I O
did O
not O
find O
it O
fair. O

Looking O
out O
again O
and O
there O
is O
always O
$37. O

Where O
to O
start? O

No O
idea, O
maybe O
the O
staff. O

You O
don’t O
know O
the O
label O
that O
belongs O
to O
a O
brasserie/café/taverne. O

Drinks B-TARGET
are O
served O
in O
even O
half O
to O
almost O
dirty O
glasses O
(lipstick O
and O
so O
on O
more O
from O
previous O
guests) O
eating B-TARGET
is O
to O
mention. O

It O
all B-TARGET
tastes O
as O
if O
it’s O
just O
finished O
meals O
that O
are O
heated O
in O
a O
microwave. O

Sauces, B-TARGET
think O
its O
pots O
are O
still O
half O
open O
and O
about O
date. O

Then O
vb O
tastes O
my O
own O
made O
mayonnaise O
that O
is O
completely O
scrubbed O
is O
even O
better O
to O
fry. O

We O
will O
remain O
silent O
on O
the O
whole O
matter B-TARGET
in O
general. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned, O
never O
again, O
rather O
than O
go O
to O
the O
pig O
stall O
on O
a O
farm, O
there O
it O
is O
more O
proper O
and O
much O
better O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
and O
service. O

We O
were O
robbed O
of O
80 O
euros O
and O
our O
food. O

After O
3x O
sauce O
questions O
and O
getting O
always O
regrettable O
sauce B-TARGET
proposed, O
I O
went O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
outbater O
story O
(still O
silent O
of O
fried, O
chicken). O

He O
became O
more O
and O
more O
unfriendly, O
and O
when O
I O
answered O
that O
the O
customer O
was O
still O
the O
king, O
he O
was O
just O
getting O
worse. O

I O
told O
him O
I O
wasn’t O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
such O
a O
service. B-TARGET

I O
went O
back O
to O
my O
wife O
and O
children. O

Yet O
Mr. O
continuing O
to O
eat O
our O
hungry O
children O
suddenly O
stood O
the O
waiter O
beside O
us. O

to O
pay! O

and O
now!! O

We O
asked O
him O
to O
calm O
down, O
but O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
several O
times. O

He O
took O
the O
food O
from O
under O
our O
nose, O
threw O
with O
a O
terrace O
chair O
and O
became O
desert O
and O
desert. O

At O
that O
time O
he O
was O
assisted O
by O
all O
staff O
members O
and O
the O
patron, B-TARGET
who O
had O
even O
released O
the O
baseball O
knot O
with O
him. O

So O
I O
couldn’t O
help O
but O
go O
to O
pay. O

I O
then O
called O
the O
police, O
but O
they O
could O
do O
nothing O
outside O
of O
listening. O

So O
at O
this O
I O
hope O
that O
people O
stay O
away O
here O
and O
keep O
saving O
from O
their O
poor O
food B-TARGET
and O
rocky O
aggressive O
services. B-TARGET

Astoria B-TARGET
palace I-TARGET
can O
destroy O
your O
affair!!!! O

Dirty O
thieves! O

Chicken B-TARGET
was O
dry, O
fish B-TARGET
was O
not O
delicious O
(it O
really O
made O
a O
dirty O
breath) O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
tasted O
like O
soap, O
fries B-TARGET
were O
sluggish O
and O
very O
fat, O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
not O
cooked, O
glasses B-TARGET
were O
not O
clean. O

After O
we O
had O
complained O
about O
the O
findings O
mentioned, O
they O
outraged O
everything O
and O
simply O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
full O
mep. O

Operating B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
with O
dirty O

inside O
it O
didn't O
really O
look O

In O
short, O
with O

around O
this O

Reserved O

10 O

with O
another O

who O
should O
be O
there, O
3 O
hours O
waiting O
for O
a O
third O
pre-cooked, O
when O
we O
made O
the O
comment O
we O
were O
asked O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
settle O
by O
the O
exploater, O
difficult O
to O
get O
a O
smile O
on O
the O
exploater B-TARGET
face O
when O
we O
decided O
to O
settle O
came O
the O
chef B-TARGET
deadly O
say O
that O
we O
do O
not O
show O
respect O
for O
the O
kitchen, O
we O
are O
people O
who O
are O
going O
to O
eat O
regularly O
but O
this O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
experienced, O
sorry O
but O
so O
a O
customer O
does O
not O
want O
to O
be O
treated O
if O
he O
paid O
a O
pepperdure O
bill, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
but O
too O
long O
to O
wait O
sorry O

Yesterday O
going O
to O
eat O
at O
Boury, B-TARGET
sorry O
but O
don't O
understand O
that O
this O
a O
star O
earned, O
the O
businesswoman's B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
leaves O
everything O
to O
be O
desired O
over, O
a O
laugh O
can't O
go O
off O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
served O
warm O
to O
have O
been O
cold, O
a O
pepperdough O
account B-TARGET
and O
not O
well O
eaten O
a O
snake O
and O
a O
dirty O
when O
settling O
sorry O
but O
if O
you O
paid O
this O
price, O
I O
think O
anyway O
that O
some O
people O
should O
review O
their O
opinion O
this O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
but O
for O
me O
a O
bistro, O
staff B-TARGET
was O
kind O
and O
apologize O
at O
the O
table O
for O
the O
behavior O
of O
their O
bosses, O
this O
I O
can O
really O
not O
recommend O

When O
we O
got O
in, O
we O
felt O
welcome. O

At O
the O
apero O
followed O
various O
snacks. O

The O
pre-trial B-TARGET
and O
main B-TARGET
trial I-TARGET
were O
real O
pictures. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
mignardises B-TARGET
with O
the O
coffee O
provided O
the O
perfect O
closing. O

The O
unusual O
wines B-TARGET
were O
truly O
discoveries. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
must O
be O
visited! O

Congratulations O
to O
the O
entire O
Boury B-TARGET
team! I-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
nice, O
original O
brasserie B-TARGET
where O
you O
are O
always O
welcome O
and O
get O
delicious O
fresh O
products; B-TARGET

A O
disadvantage, O
however, O
I O
find O
the O
price, O
with O
2 O
people O
you O
are O
soon O
above O
120 O
euros. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
well O
when O
you O
are O
in O
Veurne O
then O
you O
should O
definitely O
jump O
in O
at O
Lowie. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
comfortable, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
smooth O
and O
especially O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

Fair O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
if O
you O
like O
to O
eat O
steak B-TARGET
tartar I-TARGET
then O
it O
should O
definitely O
taste O
there O
with O
the O
self-cut O
and O
baked O
fries O

I O
had O
a O
client O
to O
spoil O
in O
Veurne. O

I O
remember O
the O
last O
super O
night, O
so O
I O
took O
no O
risk O
and O
went O
to O
visit O
this O
brasserie. O

Croquettes O
of O
sweatshirt, O
and O
other O
fine O
home B-TARGET
specialties, I-TARGET
and O
suggestion, O
etc. O

And O
ending O
with O
some O
funny O
annecdote, O
my O
client O
was O
in O
the O
clouds! O

This O
is O
for O
me O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
in O
Belgium, O
original O
dishes B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
the O
custom O
dishes, O
also O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
sublime O

Eating O
here O
is O
an O
experience. O

Custom O
meals O
for O
things O
one O
did O
not O
like O
were O
absolutely O
no O
problem. O

Great O
food, O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
sublime O
wine. B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
the O
top O
of O
the O
bill O
with O
the O
forest O
walk. O

A O
forest O
scene O
made O
of O
chocolate O
on O
a O
plate O
of O
branches O
and O
mos O
with O
octopus O
that O
rose O
from O
a O
pot. O

This O
is O
really O
enjoying! O

Why O
not O
2 O
stars? O

Parking B-TARGET
and O
surroundings B-TARGET
not O
inviting O
but O
what O
a O
surprise O
inside B-TARGET

Careful O
and O
yet O
family-friendly O
service, B-TARGET
eye-catching O
variations B-TARGET
in O
plates O
and O
always O
those O
small O
flavours O
that O
provide O
culinary O
pleasure O

Congratulations O
to O
the O
chef B-TARGET
for O
his O
courage O
to O
bring O
new O
flavors. O

Perfect O
balance O
between O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
unique O
meal. B-TARGET

The O
chef O
asked O
if O
he O
could O
live O
out O
on O
culinary O
level. O

He O
did O
this O
in O
a O
wonderful O
way. O

Every O
judgment B-TARGET
was O
a O
strangle O
for O
the O
tongue O
and O
the O
eye. O

The O
matching O
wines B-TARGET
made O
the O
unique O
experience O
complete. O

You O
feel O
that O
the O
boss B-TARGET
and O
his O
master O
do O
this O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
passion. O

We O
look O
back O
on O
a O
nice O
evening. O

Chef O
Marc, O
Maître O

I O
really O
the O

A O

Ideal O
for O
a O

A O
warm O

from O
the O

Cozy, O
cozy O
restaurant, B-TARGET
both O
on O
the O
bottom O
and O
on O
the O
upper O
floor O
(3 O
rooms O
differently O
furnished O
and O
all O
three O
cozy). O

We O
chose O
the O
menu B-TARGET
"Pearls I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
India", I-TARGET
a O
recommendation O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
get O
acquainted O
with O
different O
dishes O
from O
India. O

You O
will O
always O
get O
a O
little O
explanation O
with O
each O
dish O
and O
which O
sauces O
are O
best O
suited O
to O
which O
dish. O

We O
could O
taste O
lamb, B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
scampi I-TARGET
prepared O
in O
different O
ways. O

Very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
wines B-TARGET
(we O
chose O
the O
custom O
wines). O

Everything O
is O
fresh, O
you’ll O
be O
in O
India! O

Definitely O
recommended O
and O
suitable O
for O
repetition. O

Definitely O
a O
Recommender O

If O
you O
have O
never O
tried O
the O
exotic O
cuisine O
before! O

And O
for O
those O
who O
prefer O
the O
Belgian, O
there O
is O
also O
a O
Belgian O
cuisine. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
for O
those O
who O
are O
hungry O
there O
is O
no O
problem. O

You O
are O
ordered O
rap. O

Already O
been O
5 O
times O
and O
repeatedly O
surprised O
Biryani O
with O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
: O
varied, O
spicy O
and O
yet O
not O
too O
spicy O
and O
all O
at O
a O
fair O
price. O

Lunch O
is O
also O
recommended: O
a O
thrill O
for O
all O
senses. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
easy O
and O
always O
with O
a O
word O
of O
explanation. O

And O
when O
Vicky, B-TARGET
the O
hostess, O
even O
has O
some O
time, O
she O
comes O
with O
the O
charm O
of O
Indian O
hospitality O
to O
judge O
herself O
if O
everything O
is O
OK O
and O
if O
you O
it! O

A O
new O
restaurant, O
which O
has O
been O
in O
existence O
since O
2013. O

Between O
the O
station O
and O
the O
centre O
of O
Ronse. O

Very O
friendly O
reception. B-TARGET

and O
refined O
food. B-TARGET

The O
Indira B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Not O
large O
amounts, O
but O
refined O
so O
with O
several O
extra. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
garden O
terrace O
and O
a O
terrace O
on O
the O
street. O

Closed O
on O
Tuesday. O

Perfect O
to O
stop O
during O
a O
bike O
ride O
here O
located O
on O
the O
water, O
beautiful O
views O
and O
quietly O
good O
food, B-TARGET
nothing O
special O
but O
was O
not O
necessary O

and O
formidable! O

The O
only O
word O
that O
fits O
the O
wedding O
party O
of O
daughter O
Nathalie O
with O
son-in-law O
Stijn O
on O
August O
2, O
2014 O
in O
this O
unique O
location. B-TARGET

From O
the O
boat O
trip, O
offered O
to O
the O
couple, O
through O
the O
cozy O
and O
extremely O
spontaneous O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
to O
the O
super O
delicious O
meals B-TARGET
and O
the O
happy O
faces O
of O
family O
and O
friends O
to O
the O
fantastic O
wedding O
card! O

And O
this O
with O
a O
shining O
sunshine: O
a O
day O
to O
never O
forget... O
and O
a O
recommendation O
for O
everyone! O

We O
have O
been O
here O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
for O
2 O
years O
and O
find O
the O
food B-TARGET
again O
and O
again, O
but O
nothing O
special. O

What O
we’ve O
noticed O
is O
that O
the O
menu B-TARGET
has O
virtually O
not O
changed O
at O
this O
time, O
which O
I O
personally O
regret. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
okay O
depending O
on O
who/when/... O
one O
is O
already O
a O
little O
more O
friendly O
than O
the O
other. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
really O
pleasant O
when O
you O
sit O
outside O
and O
inside O
it O
is O
pleasant. O

Already O
several O
times O
went O
to O
eat O
with O
Gwen O
and O
Philippe O
in O
the O
Keyserhof, B-TARGET
and O
always O
went O
out O
with O
a O
smile O
again. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
food B-TARGET
delicious, O
but O
their O
staff B-TARGET
also O
deserve O
a O
thick O
plum! O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
on O
the O
Moervaart, O
which O
only O
makes O
your O
visit O
more O
cozy/romantic. O

Keep O
going O
to O
Keyserhof! B-TARGET

Bad O
and O
unfriendly O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
was O
really O
bad. O

Wait O
for O
2 O
hours O
for O
your O
meal O
with O
a O
water O
sangria, B-TARGET
then O
get O
half-warm O
food. B-TARGET

The O
bill B-TARGET
was O
4.5 O
euros O
wrong O
in O
our O
disadvantage! O

The O
worst O
restaurant B-TARGET
we’ve O
ever O
been O
to. O

Stay O
away O
there O

a O
lot O
heard O
of O
this O
but O
what O
a O
counterpart, O
the O
so-called O
everything O
self O
made O
fell O
fairly O
against, O
rather O
a O
better O
stone O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
simply O
terrible, O
long O
wait, O
wrong O
things O
on O
the O
table, O
can O
clearly O
not O
cope O
with O
the O
pressure O
and O
operation O
and O
let O
this O
very O
clearly O
notice O
to O
the O
customers O
too, O
great O
counterpart O

Back O
to O
our O
favo O
tapas B-TARGET
barret I-TARGET
in O
Herentals. O

To O
our O
surprise O
new O
users O
and O
not O
as O
cozy O
dark O
as O
before O
in O
the O
tapasbar. B-TARGET

The O
new O
users O
come O
directly O
from O
Spain O
so O
we O
were O
full O
of O
expectation O
for O
extra O
delicious O
tapas O
but O
unfortunately O
the O
gambas B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
look I-TARGET
were O
laugh O
served O
and O
not O
deliciously O
spicy O
as O
t O
should O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
also O
laugh. O

Sorry O
but O
I O
said O
something O
and O
ordered O
two O
new O
portions B-TARGET
but O
then O
hot O
and O
that O
was O
good. O

But O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
no O
longer O
there, O
apparently O
left O
with O
the O
previous O
users. O

Unfortunately O
next O
time O
we O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
large O
market O
in O
Herentals O
there O
is O
also O
a O
cosy O
tapas O
bar. O

Let O
them O
try. O

Pleasant O
and O
simple. O

Sometimes O
you O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
current B-TARGET
operators, I-TARGET
unlike O
the O
previous O
operators, O
do O
not O
work O
there O
with O
full O
"gust". O

Everyone O
is O
friendly, O
but O
a O
smile O
is O
hard. O

So, O
they O
are O
doing O
their O
best. O

Delicious O
dining O
in O
the O
romantic O
garden B-TARGET
near O
the O
water O
with O
the O
fish. O

Gamba’s B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Indian I-TARGET
style I-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
always O
friendly O
and O
quick. O

The O
food B-TARGET
takes O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
but O
is O
worth O
the O
wait O
because O
t O
is O
delicious O
and O
delicious O
fresh. O

Lunch O
is O
faster O
than O
dinner. O

In O
short, O
the B-TARGET
wild I-TARGET
vespers I-TARGET
is O
our O
favorite O
here O
in O
Herentals. O

Soon O
again! O

can O
enjoy O
it O
while O
eating. O

Or O
just O
classic O
– O
for O
a O
good O
quick O
lunch B-TARGET
you O
can O
always O
go O
here. O

The O
arrangement B-TARGET
of O
the O
tables O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
little O
strange, O
uncomfortable. O

Not O
suitable O
for O
preparing O
a O
meal. O

Sunday O
evening... O
and O
apparently O
the O
staff B-TARGET
finds O
it O
normal O
that O
there O
is O
hardly O
anything O
left O
to O
stock. O

The O
tortillas B-TARGET
that O
are O
usually O
served O
as O
a O
snack O
in O
advance. O

No O
excuses, O
just O
“they’re O
over.” O

Beer B-TARGET
and O
various O
dishes. B-TARGET

After O
all, O
if O
I O
react O
that O
this O
is O
strange, O
I O
just O
get O
the O
answer: O
it’s O
Sunday O
night, O
which O
is O
normal O
after O
a O
busy O
weekend. O

At O
chi O
chi, O
I O
do O
not O
expect O
culinary O
highs, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
should O
at O
least O
be O
correct O
and O
polite. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
we O
went O
to O
eat O
in O
't O
Backhuys O
in O
Tessenderlo. O

At O
25° O
comfortable O
dining O
on O
a O
gorgeous O
terrace, B-TARGET
which O
could O
be O
more O
fun. O

I O
ordered O
a O
steppe O
grass O
with O
steak O
and O
steak O
sauce. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
for O
our O
food. O

The O
steppe B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

But O
the O
steak B-TARGET
was O
completely O
baked O
and O
just O
like O
a O
shoe O
sool. O

My O
girlfriend’s O
chicken B-TARGET
filet I-TARGET
was O
well O
baked O
and O
deliciously O
juicy. O

Sorry O
for O
the O
meat B-TARGET
and O
the O
long O
wait, O
but O
deserved O
a O
second O
chance O
because O
of O
the O
cozy O
location B-TARGET

A O
nice O
reception, B-TARGET
a O
nice O
location, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
and O
a O
decent O
portion! O

A O
recommendation O
for O
a O
pleasant O
evening! O

We O
were O
still O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
drink O
this O
was O
not O
a O
problem, O
we O
were O
not O
excluded! O

Located O

In O

you O
can O
stay O
in O
the O
remote O
or O
completely O
inside O

Good O

mosquito O
fries. O

Let O
me O
surprise O
you! O

What O
shocked O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
only O
1 O
menu B-TARGET
was O
proposed, O
but O
o O
so O
deliciously O
eaten O
and O
drunk. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
else, O
it O
can O
be O
discussed. O

2 O
People B-TARGET
who O
know O
their O
profession O
very O
well, O
are O
very O
hospitable O
and O
if O
the O
service O
allows, O
like O
to O
make O
a O
talk O
with O
their O
guests. O

We O
are O
delighted O
to O
have O
discovered O
this O
lovely O
place B-TARGET
and O
will O
definitely O
come O
back! O

They O
had O
simply O
forgotten O
us. O

Porkhaas B-TARGET
almost O
raw O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
stove I-TARGET
you O
had O
to O
look O
for. O

Very O
unfriendly O
as O
if O
they O
don’t O
like O
you O
coming O
to O
eat. O

Worthlessly O

Dinner O
at O
the O
Cleynen O
Keyser. O

Staff B-TARGET
unfriendly, O
asked O
for O
a O
card O
twice. O

Order O
arrived O
after O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half. O

1x O
fetuccine B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
curry, I-TARGET
really O
bad O
we O
left O
out, O
2x O
grilled B-TARGET
scampi I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
butter, I-TARGET
this O
was O
served O
in O
a O
cowardly O
tasteless O
lookroom B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
not O
in O
butter, O
ready O
liflafe. B-TARGET

In O
addition, O
a O
steak O
with O
pepper O
sauce, O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
fairly O
steak B-TARGET
again O
faint. O

Wine B-TARGET
from O
tap, O
also O
dirty, O
no O
other O
wine B-TARGET
to O
order! O

The O
waitress, B-TARGET
I O
think O
daughter, O
asked O
three O
times O
for O
the O
free O
access O
code O
of O
the O
wifi O
network, O
which O
she O
couldn’t O
remember O
(!) O
so O
I O
didn’t O
get O
this? O

You O
should O
not O
offer O
it! O

Then O
at O
the O
settlement O
(Euro O
100,--) O
was O
not O
asked O
by O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
if O
it O
had O
liked O
us, O
which O
was O
clear O
because O
the O
plates O
were O
not O
empty. O

Then O
came O
the O
owner B-TARGET
who O
asked O
if O
it O
had O
tasted, O
I O
clearly O
indicated O
that O
it O
wasn’t O
good. O

The B-TARGET
gentleman I-TARGET
ran O
away O
and O
then O
stopped O
looking O
at O
me, O
and O
did O
nothing O
else O
with O
my O
answer. O

My O
advice O
is O
to O
eat O
somewhere O
else. O

is O
worthless. O
