We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
meal O
here. O

Although O
I O
read O
beforehand O
that O
the O
cook O
determines O
what O
you O
eat, O
this O
is O
not O
correct O
or O
has O
the O
restaurant O
adjusted O
this. O

There O
was O
in O
fact O
a O
menu B-TARGET
either O
3 O
courses O
or O
4 O
courses O
with O
3 O
to O
4 O
choices O
per O
course O
each. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
more O
than O
sufficient, O
especially O
since O
the O
restaurant O
is O
known O
for O
its O
Wagyu O
cattle O
and O
Mangalica O
pigs, O
then O
these O
options O
are O
usually O
chosen. O

If O
one O
is O
not O
a O
meat O
lover, O
there O
is O
also O
a O
fish O
option O
each O
time. O

Summary: O
good O
service B-TARGET
, O
good O
(higher O
level) O
food B-TARGET
and O
nice O
location B-TARGET
. O

All O
this O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price! O

Service: B-TARGET
Your O
case O
run O
by O
inexperienced O
students O
is O
never O
a O
good O
thing. O

Clearly O
understaffed O
, O
waiting O
way O
too O
long O
for O
water O
, O
bread O
, O
wine O
list O
.... O

No O
knowledge O
of O
the O
wine O
list, O
let O
alone O
the O
wines B-TARGET
by O
the O
glass O
(far O
too O
limited O
btw). O

Food B-TARGET
: O
Weird O
combinations, O
appetizer B-TARGET
beforehand O
does O
not O
stimulate O
the O
appetite O
(too O
spicy O
and O
complex). O

Appetizer O
was O
not O
refined, O
deep B-TARGET
fried I-TARGET
squid I-TARGET
overpowered O
by O
too O
greasy O
batter. O

Wild B-TARGET
caught I-TARGET
gamba I-TARGET
was O
ok O
but O
tom.sauce B-TARGET
with O
it O
was O
too O
overpowering. O

Main O
course O
was O
dorade B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
salt I-TARGET
crust I-TARGET
, O
very O
good, O
correct, O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
it. O

Lamb B-TARGET
sugo I-TARGET
...it O
was O
leg O
of O
lamb...be O
honest O
in O
your O
menu. O

Conclusion: O
i O
expected O
much O
more O
considering O
the O
reputation. O

Price O
to O
quality O
ratio O
seems O
ok O
but O
put O
experienced O
staff B-TARGET
in O
the O
room O
and O
improve O
your O
personal O
touch O
with O
the O
neighborhood O
with O
this. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
will O
be O
coming O
back O
any O
time O
soon. O

Cozy O
dining O
in O
a O
bistro B-TARGET
with O
pleasant O
atmosphere. O

Took O
the O
Royal B-TARGET
all I-TARGET
inclusive O
menu O
at O
a O
democratic O
price O
of O
42€. O

Amuse, O
starter, O
sorbet, O
main O
course O
and O
dessert O
plate O
from O
the O
chef. O

This O
with O
water O
and O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine O
per O
person. O

Highly O
recommended, O
where O
the O
steak B-TARGET
Rossini I-TARGET
was O
perfectly O
cooked O
and O
very O
tender. O

Here O
I O
will O
definitely O
come O
back. O

Of O
course O
a O
la O
carte O
is O
also O
possible. O

You O
can O
also O
enjoy O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
terrace. O

Restaurant O
de O
zuiderparel O
is O
closed O
and O
has O
made O
a O
new O
start O
as O
cafe O
brasserie. O

This O
means O
that O
they O
have O
lost O
a O
lot O
of O
quality O
without O
the O
new O
concept O
of O
conviviality, O
approachability, O
bistro O
kitchen. O

Small O
but O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
great O
service. B-TARGET

Limited O
menu B-TARGET
but O
extremely O
tasty! O

We O
took O
a O
starter, O
main O
course O
and O
dessert O
and O
everything O
was O
perfect! O

The O
price O
was O
ultimately O
not O
so O
bad O
(about O
60 O
euros O
per O
person-wine O
and O
coffee O
included) O

Unfortunately O
they O
are O
only O
open O
during O
the O
week. O

(It O
is O
best O
to O
make O
reservations) O

Service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
very O
nice O
trendy O
retro B-TARGET
interior I-TARGET
. O

Teaser B-TARGET
(hot O
drink O
with O

very O

Good O
price O
/ O
quality O
+ O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

Recommended! O

Already O
for O
the O
2nd O
time O
as O
a O
guest O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

Again O
we O
were O
culinary O
pampered O
and O
we O
could O
enjoy O
incredibly O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
presented O
as O
works O
of O
art. O

All O
this O
topped O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
dry O
humor O
and O
the O
original O
concept, B-TARGET
make O
this O
place B-TARGET
one O
of O
my O
favorites! O

Culinary O
excellence O
for O
a O
fair O
price! O

My O
favorite! O

Pure O
pleasure O
from O
start O
to O
finish.... O

Fantastic O
flavor O
bombs O
with O
surprising O
structures O
and O
combinations...each O
dish B-TARGET
is O
a O
work O
of O
art. O

Pure O
class! O

I O
also O
really O
like O
the O
touch O
of O
humor O
that O
you O
can O
discover O
everywhere. O

An O
experience O
you O
love O
to O
think O
back O
on O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
yearn O
for O
the O
next O
reservation. O

Interior B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
this O
restaurant O
are O
fine. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
correct O
but O
could O
be O
better. O

We O
did O
not O
find O
the O
typical O
Thai O
friendliness O
and O
cordiality O
here. O

We O
ate O
the O
Discovery O
menu O
(via O
a O
Groupon O
voucher). O

Based O
on O
what O
we O
were O
served, O
we O
would O
not O
like O
to O
pay O
the O
full O
price. O

Rather O
small O
portions B-TARGET
(which O
may O
be O
acceptable O
given O
the O
voucher), O
food B-TARGET
was O
lukewarm O
instead O
of O
hot. O

It O
was O
certainly O
fresh O
but O
most O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
rather O
bland. O

We O
arrived O
at O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
Groupon O
voucher. O

We O
had O
subscribed O
to O
a O
Discovery O
set O
menu. O

The O
food B-TARGET
itself O
was O
very O
good O
but O
we O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
the O
promotion O
to O
half O
the O
price O
was O
only O
half O
the O
normal O
portion. B-TARGET

It O
was O
so O
little O
that O
we O
left O
extremely O
disappointed, O
even O
the O
action O
price O
seemed O
a O
lot O
for O
what O
we O
got. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
big O
eater O
but O
it O
was O
just O
laughably O
small, O
I O
think O
there O
was O
less O
than O
100g O
of O
meat/chicken/scampi B-TARGET
in O
total. O

And O
then O
a O
small O
soup O
bowl O
of O
rice O
to O
go B-TARGET
with O
it, O
which O
also O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
for O
both O
of O
us. O

(The O
picture O
on O
the O
discovery O
menu O
site O
is O
correct, O
only O
it O
looks O
like O
you O
get O
it O
per O
person O
instead O
of O
per O
two). O

We O
ate O
here O
last O
Friday. O

It O
was O
very O
tasty O
again. O

It O
remains O
good. O

Food B-TARGET
is O

But O
also O
(only O
if O
you O
have O
reserved) O
very O
good, O
tasty, O
extensive O
breakfast B-TARGET
. O

Price O

very O
good. O

Very O
friendly O
attentive O

With O
nice O

sit O
outside. O

We O
come O
back O
again. O

You O
really O

at O

Very O
good O

If O
you O
go O
for O
lunch O
shrimp O

Delicious. O

It O
is O
always O
a O
treat O
to O
eat O
here. O

For O
50 O
euros O
you O
can O
enjoy O
the O
fantastic O
thai B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
, O
the O
personal O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
cozy O
home O
atmosphere B-TARGET
. O

First O
an O
aperitif O
in O
the O
beautiful O
garden B-TARGET
and O
then O
we O
let O
ourselves O
be O
surprised O
with O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

Especially O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
could O
charm O
us. O

Definitely O
a O
must O
... O
with O
2 O
or O
in O
group. O

Do O
make O
reservations! O

Fantastic, O
beautiful O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
unique O
combinations, O
smooth, O
but O
not O
rigid O
service. B-TARGET

Only O
downside O
I O
found O
the O
noisy O
environment. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
very O
noisy O
group O
next O
to O
us O
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
gave O
insufficient O
muffling O
so O
that O
we O
could O
understand O
each O
other O
sometimes O
with O
difficulty. O

Furthermore, O
it O
is O
quite O
pricey, O
but O
you O
get O
absolutely O
value O
for O
money. O

Highly O
recommended! O

Yesterday O
we O
went O
to O
Ninove O
for O
a O
test O
with O
the O
three O
of O
us O
and O
we O
were O
all O
very O
satisfied. O

Was O
very O
tasty O
and O
very O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
we O
will O
definitely O
do O
this O
again. O

Hopefully O
many O
other O
people O
will O
discover O
this O
place! O

In O
September O
they O
start O
with O
a O
buffet, O
we O
will O
certainly O
taste O
everything! O

Highly O
recommended! O

Going O
out O
for O
a O
nice O
Indian O
meal O
like O
in O
London. O

Ordered O
a O
soup B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables: I-TARGET
exactly O
a O
bad O
minestrone O
with O
floating O
vegetable O
cubes O
in O
a O
blurry O
liquid. O

And O
then O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
again O
and O
meanwhile O
your O
drink O
is O
already O
finished O
and O
nobody O
noticed. O

And O
finally O
the O
main O
course O
came. O

A O
real O
disappointment O
in O
terms O
of O
seasoning O
and O
taste. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
serve O
Indian O
do O
it O
the O
Indian O
way O
with O
many O
small O
dishes O
in O
pots O
and O
some O
naân O
there O
and O
like O
spicy O
rice. O

An O
Indian O
menu O
can O
not O
consist O
of O
soup, O
starter, O
main O
course, O
..., O
dessert O
like O
Western O
cuisine. O

Try O
to O
remain O
original! O

I O
have O
to O
be O
honest O
that O
this O
is O
the O
least O
good O
indie B-TARGET
I O
have O
ever O
gone O
to O
eat. O

There O
is O
also O
never O
no O
people, O
which O
of O
course O
is O
already O
a O
sign. O

We O
went O
there O
to O
eat O
with O
a O
voucher. O

We O
got O
enough, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
really O
very O
tasty. O

Friendly O
service, B-TARGET
the O
manager B-TARGET
is O
always O
willing O
to O
chat O
even O
if O
it O
is O
busy. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
fast. O

You O
never O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
for O
tasty O
fries B-TARGET
. O

Definitely O
a O
must, O
even O
if O
you O
want O
to O
sit O
quietly O
in O
the O
adjacent O
restaurant O
area. O

Good O
fries B-TARGET
, O
nowhere O
in O
Hasselt O
you O
can O
eat O
fries B-TARGET
for O
these O
prices. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
friendly, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
cozy. O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
something O
could O
be O
done O
about O
the O
exhaust O
system O
(if O
they O
have O
one O
at O
all), O
if O
you O
are O
in O
there O
for O
5 O
minutes O
everyone O
can O
smell O
that O
you O
are O
from O
the O
Marmite. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
better O
dishes B-TARGET
brought O
at O
democratic O
prices. O

Today O
we O
are O
going O
to O
try O
mussels. O

More O
later. O

The O
tapas B-TARGET
beforehand O
were O
already O
a O
hit. O

The O
chef O
serves O
the O
appropriate O
beers O
with O
each O
dish. O

The O
wine O
we O
have O
passed O
today. O

Extraordinary O
reception O
by O
a O
sweet O
hostess. B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
small O
but O
very O
cozy O
restaurant, B-TARGET
you O
must O
absolutely O
book. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
changes O
regularly O
and O
is O
small. O

I O
find O
that O
always O
an O
advantage O
for O
a O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
on O
the O
table O
are O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
delicious O
accompanied O
by O
the O
excellent O
wine O
advice O
from O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
. O

This O
is O
pure O
indulgence. O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
very O
cozy, O
food B-TARGET
really O
top O
level. O

with O
a O
voucher O
to O
la O
vache O
qui O
suisse O
been. O

after O
many O
disappointments O
with O
vouchers, O
we O
have O
eaten O
very O
well, O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
original, O
eg O
potatoes B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
peel I-TARGET
in O
a O
jute O
bag, O
beautiful! O

We O
will O
definitely O
return O
here O
for O
example O
for O
a O
cheese O
fondue O
- O
also O
very O
tasty O
smoke O

You O
get O
what O
you O
should O
expect. O

Tasty O
fondue, B-TARGET
good O
service. B-TARGET

Nothing O
to O
complain O
about. O

Of O
course O
more O
fun O
in O
the O
winter O
months O
than O
in O
the O
summer, O
quite O
naturally O

It O
had O
been O
several O
years O
since O
I O
had O
been O
in O
the O
Orangerie. O

Never O
again! O

Scampi B-TARGET
in O
a O
thick O
floury O
sauce O
no O
taste. O

Steak B-TARGET
bearnaise I-TARGET
: O
sauce O
was O
too O
thick O
and O
cold O
to O
pour O
over O
meat. O

Disgusting. O

Even O
out O
of O
a O
jar O
it O
is O
better. O

French O
fries B-TARGET
had O
a O
weird O
aftertaste. O

Friend O
had O
a O
cod B-TARGET
stew I-TARGET
you O
could O
put O
a O
fork O
in O
straight. O

Staff B-TARGET
though O
friendly, O
but O
had O
to O
decide O
what O
we O
wanted O
a O
bit O
fast O
even O
though O
there O
was O
only O
one O
other O
couple O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Never O
again!!! O

110 O
euros O
paid O
for O
what O
you O
would O
not O
get O
in O
a O
friterie. O

Very O
good O
location B-TARGET
and O
great O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
nonchalant O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
slow. O

If O
the O
case O
is O
full O
then O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
-what O
translates O
into O
slow O
service B-TARGET
and O
mistakes. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
Nicoise I-TARGET
is O
not O
really O
a O
hit O
- O
just O
some O
canned O
tuna O
with O
lettuce, O
without O
much O
inspiration. O

Too O
bad, O
because O
for O
the O
price O
you O
really O
expect O
more O
of O
this O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

And O
very O
good O
food O
too! O

We O
followed O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
waiter: O
the O
flat B-TARGET
oysters I-TARGET
are O
in O
and O
they O
were O
indeed O
delicious. O

Nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
known O
for O
its O
beautiful O
tender O
pieces O
of O
meat B-TARGET
(entrecote, O
filet O
pur, O
steaks) O
but O
also O
very O
nice O
shrimp B-TARGET
croquettes, I-TARGET
stew. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
but O
sometimes O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
lack O
of O
personal O
touch O
due O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

Separate O
entrance B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
personal O
welcome. B-TARGET
Every O
glance O
in O
the O
antique O
interior O
highlights O
an O
old O
doll, O
a O
jewel, O
a O
handbag, O
etc. O
Service B-TARGET

This O
caterer B-TARGET
of O

better O
stick O
to O
its O
last. O

A O
previous O
visit O
to O
the O
restaurant O
in O
Onderbergen O
was O
quite O
ok: O
nice O
wine O
list, O
refined O
menus O
(plural). O

Recently O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
at O
the O
new O
location O
with O
customers. O

Only O
one O
menu B-TARGET
to O
choose O
from, O
the O
full O
menu O
or O
the O
slimmed O
down O
version O
(by O
deleting O
one O
or O
more O
courses), O
supplemented O
with O
some O
à O
la O
carte O
choices. O

The O
strength O
of O
a O
kitchen B-TARGET
can O
lie O
in O
its O
simplicity, O
this O
was O
really O
very O
simple O
for O
about O
55 O
euros O
excluding O
wines, O
for O
this O
you O
can O
better O
dis O
in O
Ghent: O
Karel O
de O
Stoute, O
House O
of O
Elliott, O
Grade O
and O
others. O

The O
service O
by O
young O
waiters B-TARGET
could O
also O
be O
more O
professional. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
will O
be O
called O
'purified', O
it O
is O
cold, O
offers O
only O
a O
moderate O
'hotel O
atmosphere'. O

Except O
for O
the O
neatly O
starched O
napkins, O
there O
was O
no O
dust O
to O
be O
found O
on O
the O
tables. O

In O
a O
restaurant O
like O
le O
Grand O
Bleu O
that O
is O
a O
style O
feature, O
given O
the O
lived-in O
style: O
old O
tables, O
mix O
of O
types O
of O
chairs, O
etc. O

Here O
it O
leaves O
a O
cold O
impression, O
combined O
with O
mediocre O
execution O
of O
the O
dishes.... O

As O
a O
burgundian O
with O
an O
eye O
for O
fine O
cuisine, O
I O
will O
let O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
pass O
me O
by O
in O
the O
future. O

Much O
ado O
about O
nothing! O

We O
had O
made O
reservations O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
upon O
arrival O
we O
had O
to O
look O
out O
for O
a O
table. O

Table B-TARGET
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
kitchen O
windows, O
intimate O
dinner O
for O
two, O
stationed O
next O
to O
noisy O
group O
from O
Aalst O
(not O
really O
ideal). O

Hugo B-TARGET
aperitif, I-TARGET
very O
tasty, O
beautifully O
presented. O

Asked O
3 O
course O
menu O
+ O
glass O
of O
white O
with O
starter O
and O
glass O
of O
red O
with O
main O
course. O

The B-TARGET
latter I-TARGET
we O
never O
saw... O

Appetizer B-TARGET
(to O
share) O
was O
very O
tasty, O
beef O
tartare. O

Appetizer B-TARGET
(scallop) O
I O
found O
unconvincing O
and O
not O
cold O
enough O
to O
be O
cold O
appetizer O
and O
a O
bit O
too O
lukewarm O
to O
be O
warm O
appetizer.... O

Main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
(duck) O
was O
ok O
in O
taste O
( O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
nice) O
but O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
not O
crispy O
fried O
and O
duck O
was O
tough. O

Dessert B-TARGET
was O
disappointing, O
came O
METHODS O
after O
main O
course O
and O
the O
chocolate O
that O
was O
in O
the O
description O
was O
not O
found. O

Personally, O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
disappointed O
with O
the O
price/quality. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty, O
fast O
service B-TARGET
, O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
!!! O

Top O
restaurant B-TARGET
;-) O

The O
appearance O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
looks O
simple, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
absolutely O
not! O

Card B-TARGET
is O
special O
because O
of O
the O
large O
amount O
of O
pizzas. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly. O

I O
am O
a O
big O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
fan, O
so O
I O
have O
had O
ice O
cream O
in O
many O
places, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
best O
ice O
cream O
I O
have O
ever O
had! O

Mmmmmm.... O

I O
am O
already O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
next O
visit! O

During O
my O
studies O
in O
Leuven, O
I O
saw O
Decadenza O
grow O
into O
a O
popular O
ice O
cream O
store. O

Now O
I O
live O
in O
Berlin O
and O
every O
time O
I'm O
back O
in O
Belgium O
I O
hurry O
to O
Leuven O
for O
a O
scoop O
of O
real O
Decadenza O
ice B-TARGET
cream. I-TARGET

Best O
I've O
had O
so O
far! O

Good O
price O
and O
quality. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
for O
Belgian O
standards. O

Wide O
choice O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
with O
lots O
of O
variation. O

Eaten O
in O
an O
almost O
empty O
restaurant O
(4 O
tables O
occupied). O

That O
in O
itself O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
more O
concerned O
with O
each O
other O
than O
with O
the O
guests. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
very O
long O
time O
for O
the O
dessert O
to O
be O
cleared O
and O
taken O
away. O

The O
music, B-TARGET
which O
absolutely O
does O
not O
fit O
in O
a O
restaurant, O
was O
suddenly O
turned O
up O
loud O
during O
dinner. O

Pinning O
with O
a O
nl O
bank O
card O
was O
not O
possible. O

Also O
credit O
card O
was O
not O
accepted. O

Delicious O
food O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price. O

The O
ham B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
mustard I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
a O
plentiful O
piece O
of O
tender O
meat O
with O
a O
crisp O
salad. O

The O
homemade O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
for O
dessert O
was O
just O
enough O
to O
go O
with O
it. O

We O
will O
definitely O
be O
back! O

We O
ate O
the O
sole B-TARGET
strips I-TARGET
at O
30€, O
they O
were O
tasteless O
and O
very O
small O
(4 O
chunks). O

Also O
the O
wine, B-TARGET
14€ O
for O
a O
small O
1/2L, O
was O
nothing. O

Apparently, O
and O
hopefully, O
you O
are O
better O
served O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
meat O
here. O

Person O
X O

A O
household O
name O
in O
Leuven O
with O
the O
classic O
Italian B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
with O
some O
adaptations O
for O
the O
Belgian O
gourmets. O

Has O
been O
around O
for O
maybe O
50 O
years O
and O
is O
still O
true O
to O
itself. O

I O
passed O
by O
every O
day O
and O
always O
saw O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
inside O
so O
I O
thought O
I'd O
go O
in. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
ok, O
interior B-TARGET
quite O
boring O
and O
old. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
a O
disappointment. O

Fish B-TARGET
pan I-TARGET
for O
example O
was O
cold O
and O
not O
fresh O
at O
all. O

For O
that O
price O
you O
can O
eat O
much O
better O
in O
Leuven O
if O
you O
know O
the O
good O
places. O

I O
can't O
say O
it O
was O
great O
but O
also O
not O
bad. O

Both O
for O
service O
and O
food. O

I O
also O
find O
it O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
got. O

Very O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

Plates B-TARGET
not O
washed O
clean, O
look O
greasy. O

Stew B-TARGET
exactly O
from O
the O
fryer. O

Fries B-TARGET
from O
the O
freezer O
bags.... O

Definitely O
not O
worth O
the O
money! O

What O
a O
disappointment! O

Very O
nice O
dinner. O

Price O
quality O
excellent. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Ham O
with O
mustard O
sauce. O

The O
water O
comes O
back O
into O
my O
mouth. O

For O
me, O
restaurant B-TARGET
Zeno I-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
top O
addresses O
in O
Bruges. O

What O
you O
get O
served O
there O
borders O
on O
the O
unbelievable! O

From O
the O
amuses O
to O
the O
delicacies O
with O
coffee, O
everything O
is O
top! O

We O
have O
already O
eaten O
at O
Zeno's B-TARGET
three O
times O
and O
each O
time O
it O
was O
a O
culinary O
hit. O

Even O
if O
you O
take O
the O
cheaper O
menu O
(during O
the O
week), O
the O
same O
amuses O
and O
mignardises O
are O
served O
as O
with O
the O
big O
menu. O

The O
only O
downside O
for O
me O
is O
the O
chilly O
interior B-TARGET
, O
but O
that O
will O
certainly O
not O
stop O
me O
from O
going O
to O
Zeno O
again. O

The O
smooth O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

Zeno B-TARGET
is O
highly O
recommended O
and O
certainly O
worthy O
of O
a O
Michelin O
star. O

Last O
night O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal O
at O
this O
restaurant! O

It O
is O
located O
a O
bit O
out O
of O
the O
center, O
so O
it O
is O
not O
full O
of O
tourists. O

It O
was O
packed, O
but O
luckily O
we O
had O
reservations. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
to O
have O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
here, O
call O
in O
advance. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
nicely O
decorated. O

It O
seems O
like O
you O
go O
back O
in O
time. O

Nice O
background O
music, O
everywhere O
things O
on O
the O
wall O
and O
great O
seats. O

We O
were O
helped O
by O
a O
nice O
and O
spontaneous O
woman! B-TARGET

Respect O
for O
her, B-TARGET
walking O
alone O
eleven O
tables O
is O
quite O
a O
task. O

Not O
for O
a O
moment O
did O
she O
seem O
rushed O
and O
she O
took O
her O
time O
for O
everyone. O

We O
had O
chosen O
mussels O
and O
a O
steak O
tartare. O

It O
tasted O
delicious O
and O
the O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
absolutely O
right! O

I O
can O
heartily O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
everyone. O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

We O
chose O
the O
Flemish B-TARGET
stew I-TARGET
and O
it O
turned O
out O
great. O

A O
very O
generous O
portion B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
Belgian B-TARGET
fries I-TARGET
! O

The O
well-priced O
house B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
which O
was O
recommended, O
matched O
excellently. O

Extremely O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

It O
is O
located O
slightly O
outside O
the O
center, O
but O
the O
walk O
is O
rewarded O
with O
a O
very O
good O
meal. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

X O
and O
Y O

Good O
food. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
. O

This O
is O
where O
I O
would O
eat O
a O
second O
time O
without O
a O
second O
thought O
. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
also O
highly O
recommended. O

Bruges O
is O
a O
beautiful O
city. O

The O
spareribs B-TARGET
were O
delicious! O

Staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
good O
service. O

Nachos B-TARGET
beforehand O
very O
tasty O
(and O
a O
lot, O
small O
portion B-TARGET
is O
easy O
to O
eat O
with O
3 O
people). O

Meat B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
tasty. O

Reserve O
in O
advance O
!!! O

Here O
perfection O
is O
pursued! O

Blessed O
pastries B-TARGET
and O
the O
bread B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
raisins I-TARGET
is O
perfect O
!!! O

Friendly O
service, B-TARGET
and O
top O
pastry B-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
!!!! O

Super O
delicious, O
super O
fresh, O
original O
patisserie B-TARGET
with O
a O
super O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
more O
to O
say O
about O
it...and O
as O
for O
the O
price, O
you O
pay O
for O
quality O
and O
in O
that O
sense O
they O
are O
even O
cheap O
:-) O

Books B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
fantastic! O

Breakfast B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
very O
fresh, O
ample, O
wide O
choice, O
very O
good O
coffee B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
milk I-TARGET
. O

So O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
super. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
smooth! O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
spontaneous! O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is O
also O
nice! O

One O
sits O
comfortably O
between O
the O
books O
that O
are O
nicely O
arranged. O

The O
books O
can O
also O
be O
purchased. O

Also O
nice! O

For O
Bruges, O
this O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
really O
an O
asset! O

Congratulations O
to O
the O
owners. O

We O
are O
happy O
to O
have O
discovered O
Books B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Brunch!!! I-TARGET

Books B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
of O
the O
best O
that O
Bruges O
has O
to O
offer. O

I O
discovered O
this O
place O
when O
it O
opened O
recently, O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
this O
cozy O
and O
atmospheric O
establishment B-TARGET
, O
and O
still O
am. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is O
obviously O
something O
unique O
in O
Bruges O
and O
something O
that O
no O
matter O
what O
your O
reason O
for O
visiting, O
you O
always O
turn O
off O
to O
look O
through O
the O
books. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
fresh O
and O
you O
taste O
that O
it O
is O
not O
forced. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
at O
Books O
& O
Brunch O
is O
so O
wonderful, O
do O
you O
come O
for O
lunch, O
a O
coffee O
or O
a O
tea. O

There O
is O
an O
optimal O
coziness, O
calmness O
and O
everything O
is O
not O
forced O
and O
done O
at O
ease O
without O
seeming O
lax. O

The B-TARGET
lady I-TARGET
who O
runs O
the O
place O
deserves O
a O
mention O
for O
her O
friendliness. O

Lovely O
place B-TARGET
to O
come O
and O
have O
lunch O
with O
your O
friend, O
mom O
or O
comrade O
or O
just O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
tea B-TARGET
or I-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
and O
browse O
through O
a O
book O
or O
enjoy O
the O
free O
wifi O
with O
the O
MacBook O
or O
iPhone. O

Books B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Brunch I-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
gem O
between O
all O
the O
touristy O
restaurants O
and O
cafes O
that O
dominate O
Bruges. O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
, O
very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
, O
delicious O
home-made B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
. O

Just O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
so O
limited O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
, O
otherwise O
we O
would O
have O
had O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
there O
too. O

As O
vegetarians, O
it O
is O
far O
from O
obvious O
to O
find O
a O
good O
restaurant, O
where O
people O
do O
not O
assume O
that O
'vegetarian' O
just O
means O
that O
you O
leave O
the O
meat O
out. O

For O
all O
the O
people O
with O
the O
same O
problem, O
here O
is O
the O
solution. O

After O
some O
searching O
on O
the O
internet, O
we O
finally O
made O
a O
reservation O
here O
for O
the O
Sunday O
night, O
with O
2 O

In O
the O
end, O
it O
was O
not O
busy O
that O
night, O
but O
when O
I O
read O
the O
other O
reviews, O
it O
is O
still O
safer O
to O
make O
a O
reservation! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
sincere, O
and O
that O
is O
really O
a O
lot O
more O
pleasant O
than O
too O
chic O
and O
forced. O

We O
were O
also O
explicitly O
asked O
throughout O
the O
evening O
if O
everything O
was O
to O
our O
liking, O
without O
the O
service B-TARGET
being O
too O
forced. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
also O
makes O
for O
a O
relaxing O
evening. O

We O
chose O
the O
vegetarian B-TARGET
four-course I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
, O
and O
it O
was O
definitely O
worth O
it! O

The O
amuse O
was O
a O
tapenade B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
olives I-TARGET
and O
was O
really O
surprisingly O
delicious! O

We O
were O
also O
given O
some O
bread O
with O
olive O
oil O
within O
5 O
minutes. O

Always O
nice O
when O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
wait O
long! O

The O
two O
appetizers B-TARGET
were O
also O
to O
my O
liking, O
but O
especially O
the O
appetizer B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
coeur I-TARGET
de I-TARGET
boeuf I-TARGET
has O
stayed O
with O
me! O

This O
was O
served O
with O
melon O
and O
is O
a O
very O
original O
vegetarian O
version O
of O
the O
classic O
Spanish O
ham O
with O
melon. O

For O
the O
main O
course, O
the O
vegan B-TARGET
lasagna I-TARGET
, O
it O
is O
again O
true O
that O
there O
is O
no O
assumption O
here O
of O
'we O
just O
leave O
out O
the O
meat'. O

This O
was O
truly O
a O
full O
dish B-TARGET
, O
and O
finished O
with O
a O
basil B-TARGET
pesto I-TARGET
, O
which O
was O
tasty O
enough O
to O
eat O
on O
its O
own. O

For O
dessert O
then O
we O
chose O
the O
vegan B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
and O
although O
it O
is O
indeed O
something O
very O
different O
from O
what O
you O
expect O
, O
we O
were O
kindly O
warned O
about O
this O
beforehand, O
it O
is O
really O
a O
must! O

Really O
a O
dark O
chocolate B-TARGET
taste I-TARGET
, O
which O
goes O
super O
in O
combination O
with O
the O
orange O
slices O
served O
with O
it. O

In O
short, O
when O
you O
come O
out O
here O
you O
have O
really O
eaten O
for O
your O
money. O

The O
generous O
portions B-TARGET
, O
the O
hospitable O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
chef B-TARGET
who O
has O
clearly O
mastered O
cooking O
without O
meat O
or O
fish O
are O
well O
worth O
the O
price. O

We O
will O
definitely O
be O
back O
here, O
maybe O
to O
test O
the O
beautiful O
terrace? B-TARGET

never O
again!!!!!!, O
my O
animals O
get O
better O
food!!!!, O
only O
the O
money O
counts O
stay O
away O
from O
there O
and O
go O
elsewhere O
where O
it O
is O
certainly O
much O
better O
no O
price/quality!!! O
!! O

that O
something B-TARGET
like O
this O

acceptable. O

Hopefully O
they O
don't O
talk O

into O

there O
because O
this O
is O
prohibited O
in O

We O
will O
keep O

this. O

I O

it!!!! O

The O
soup B-TARGET
of O
the O
day O
was O
stiff O
with O
salt. O

A O
dash O
of O
warm O
water O
was O
offered O
as O
a O
solution. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
tasty, O
but O
a O
floret O

all O

When O

all O

No O

Go O
around O
it O

Never O
been O
in O
such O
a O
dirty O
and O
disordered O
mcdonalds B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
definitely O
a O
turn O
off. O

They O
should O
close O
this O
case B-TARGET

We O
went O
there O
to O
quickly O
satisfy O
our O
hunger, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
5 O
hamburgers: O
15-20 O
minutes. O

For O
the O
rest, O
we O
noticed O
that O
not O
the O
whole O
price B-TARGET
tag I-TARGET
(like O
eurodeals) O
was O
clearly O
displayed O
somewhere. O

a O
very O
greasy O

dirty O
business, B-TARGET

only O
600 O

everything O
there O
is O
bad O
normal O
a O

already O
several O
times O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
black-haired B-TARGET
lesbian I-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
gives O
change O
"accidentally" O
too O
little O
back. O

Also O
at O
the O
table O
behind O
I O
heard O
people O
complaining O
that O
they O
had O
received O
ten O
euros O
short. O

This O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
coincidence. O

A O
lot O
of O
nostalgia O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
where, O
among O
other O
things, O
buttermilk O
stews O
are O
on O
the O
menu. O

Menu B-TARGET
at O
an O
attractive O
price. O

Many O
stairs O
not O
so O
useful O
for O
people O
with O
locomotor O
problems. O

Very O
friendly O
people. B-TARGET

Since O
we O
have O
a O
second O
house O
in O
Knokke O
I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
nice O
lunch O
restaurant/brasserie. O

Map B-TARGET
looked O
good, O
tables B-TARGET
neatly O
covered. O

Food B-TARGET
too O
expensive O
for O
what O
was O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
chicken B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
could O
be O
a O
better O
mix O
and O
the O
fries B-TARGET
I O
just O
didn't O
like. O

The O
checkout O
took O
a O
very O
long O
time O
while O
it O
was O
not O
busy O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Further O
search O
for O
a O
lunch O
address O
so. O

Friendly O
welcome, B-TARGET
busy O
on O
this O
Saturday O
night. O

Menu B-TARGET
at O
very O
acceptable O
price. O

Shrimp B-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
made O
in-house. O

Half B-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
a O
bit O
minimal O
of O
portion. O

Fast O
(too?) O
service. B-TARGET

We O
got O
what O
we O
expected O
but O
also O
no O
more. O

The O
lunch B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
price-quality O
very O
good. O

Good O
choice B-TARGET
and O
large O
portions. B-TARGET

Shrimp B-TARGET
croquette I-TARGET
where O
you O
do O
not O
have O
to O
look O
for O
the O
shrimp O
. O

Friendly O
service, B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
olives B-TARGET
with O
the O
apero O
;) O

In O
short: O
highly O
recommended O
and O
worth O
repeating. O

During O
the O
fireworks O
festival O
in O
Knokke O
it O
is O
always O
busy. O

Also O
the O
terrace O
of O
the O
Lodge O
is O
well O
filled. O

When O
we O
found O
a O
place O
we O
were O
promptly O
wished O
good O
luck O
by O
our O
table O
neighbors. O

When O
we O
called O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
he O
comes O
to O
take O
our O
order, O
but O
when O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
we O
were O
new O
clients, O
he O
cancelled O
the O
recorded O
order O
and O
told O
us O
that O
he O
will O
serve O
his O
existing O
clients O
first, O
before O
serving O
us. O

When O
calling O
a O
2nd O
waiter, B-TARGET
we O
had O
even O
less O
success O
because O
this O
does O
not O
know O
the O
Dutch O
language O
and O
walked O
there O
for O
bacon O
and O
beans. O

After O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
of O
patience O
given O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
of O
the O
evening, O
and O
the O
noticeably O
understaffed O
staff O
and O
already O
4 O
tables O
to O
see O
have O
left, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
comes O
to O
clear O
our O
crowded O
table, O
where O
we O
make O
a O
3rd O
attempt O
to O
order, O
and O
the O
waiter O
reminds O
us O
after O
30min O
patience O
to O
want O
to O
wait O
another O
15 O
minutes. O

He O
prefers O
to O
play O
the O
game O
of O
"bullying O
the O
kitchen", O
where O
he O
first O
wants O
to O
clear O
all O
his O
tables, O
and O
then O
in O
5 O
minutes O
go O
take O
the O
order O
of O
food O
and O
drinks O
from O
about O
15 O
new O
tables. O

Great O
for O
the O
cook O
and O
great O
for O
himself, O
he O
can O
serve O
15 O
dishes O
at O
a O
time, O
provide O
drinks O
at O
15 O
tables O
and O
clear O
15 O
tables O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

Since O
we O
have O
been O
very O
patient, O
we O
had O
hoped O
for O
a O
price O
of O
"boiling O
points" O
but O
alas. O

After O
walking O
further O
down O
the O
dike, O
we O
stopped O
at O
the O
next O
restaurant O
"waterl'eau" O
where O
we O
could O
immediately O
take O
a O
seat O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
eat O
something O
given O
the O
crowd O
that O
night. O

We O
promptly O
got O
our O
aperitif, O
were O
served O
friendly, O
and O
quickly O
got O
our O
food. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later O
we O
saw O
half O
of O
the O
terrace O
of O
"the O
lodge" O
nesting O
on O
our O
terrace O
at O
"waterl'eau". O

The B-TARGET
lodge I-TARGET
there O
I O
will O
never O
go O
again. O

Despite O
the O
age O
of O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
you O
would O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
he O
already O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
experience, O
however, O
I O
would O
not O
want O
such O
a O
sign O
in O
my O
business. O

In O
addition, O
the O
case O
should O
also O
recognize O
that O
1 O
waiter O
for O
such O
a O
terrace O
is O
unfeasible! O

If O
I O
have O
to O
wait O
40 O
minutes O
for O
1 O
drink O
or O
for O
my O
food, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
this O
is O
normal O
anymore. O

After O
a O
bike O
ride O
in O
the O
Westhoek O
we O
had O
a O
nice O
dinner O
at O
Capella. O

A O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
of O
the O
Grote O
Markt. O

At O
our O
request, O
a O
table O
was O
set O
on O
the O
terrace. O

A O
surprisingly O
tasty O
snack B-TARGET
with O
the O
aperitif O
and O
delicious O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
scampi. I-TARGET

To O
be O
repeated. O

We O
have O
eaten O
here O
PRIMA, O
great O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
a O
very O
good O
price O
/ O
quality O
ratio. O

For O
the O
2nd O
time O
this O
year O
we O
made O
a O
reservation O
at O
this O
super O
restaurant. B-TARGET

This O
time O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends. O

Like O
every O
time O
it O
is O
enjoying O
sublime O
flavor B-TARGET
combinations I-TARGET
and O
delicious O
matching B-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

Each O
time O
we O
are O
surprised O
by O
the O
exceptionally O
refined O
cuisine. B-TARGET

A O
nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
without O
much O
tralala, O
good O
food B-TARGET
for O
a O
best O
price-quality. O

Only O
downside, O
sometimes O
noisy O
when O
there O
are O
large O
groups O
at O
a O
table. O

But O
yes, O
that O
is O
student-ish, O
and O
you O
take O
that O
with O
you. O

What O
seemed O
like O
fun O
at O
first, O
became O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
bad O
experience. O

Mussels O
at O
15€? O

Forget O
it! O

You O
can't O
get O
them O
for O
less O
than O
20€. O

We O
were O
ushered O
in O
by O
a O
man B-TARGET
who O
rather O
bossily O
and O
grimly O
commanded O
us O
to O
take O
our O
seats O
in O
the O
filled O
section O
of O
the O
resto. O

I O
really O
didn't O
like O
that O
man. B-TARGET

Looking O
around O
the O
room, O
I O
decided O
not O
to O
eat O
mussels O
or O
steak. O

I O
did O
not O
trust O
the O
place B-TARGET
right O
away. O

I O
opted O
for O
spaghetti O
and O
a O
carafe B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
that O
tasted O
sour. O

I O
don't O
know O
what O
I O
ate O
but O
it O
didn't O
seem O
kosher O
to O
me. O

The O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
came O
when O
I O
wanted O
to O
pay O
with O
bancontact O
or O
visa. O

That O
was O
not O
possible O
according O
to O
the O
boss. O

It O
had O
to O
be O
cash. O

Yes, O
there O
you O
have O
it, O
I O
thought.... O

Cheaters O
of O
the O
first O
order. O

So O
I O
left O
my O
wife O
and O
child O
to O
walk O
500 O
meters O
to O
collect O
cash. O

When O
I O
pointed O
out O
to O
the O
owner B-TARGET
that O
this O
is O
very O
shady O
business, O
she O
made O
a O
scene O
and O
refused O
to O
give O
me O
change. O

I O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
to O
be O
sick O
that O
night. O

I O
repeatedly O
asked O
my O
wife O
'what O
did O
I O
actually O
eat? O

I'd O
like O
to O
know!' O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
a O
turn-off. O

They O
should O
just O
close O
places B-TARGET
like O
this O
immediately. O

Nothing O
good O
about O
it. O

Terrible! O

This O
was O
my O
biggest O
disappointment O
ever O
in O
terms O
of O
take-away B-TARGET
. O

We O
were O
staying O
in O
Sunparks O
and O
wanted O
to O
take O
out O
a O
pizza O
in O
Nieuwpoort. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
dough I-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
the O
topping B-TARGET
and O
certainly O
the O
price O
was O
a O
letdown. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
very O
poorly O
filled O
and O
the O
taste O
was O
very O
bland. O

Also, O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
restaurant O
while O
takeaway B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
was O
cheaper O
in O
the O
brochure. O

I O
had O
only O
seen O
this O
when O
I O
arrived O
at O
the O
house O
of O
Sunparks. O

This O
was O
for O
me O
the O
biggest O
disappointment O
ever O
and O
here O
I O
definitely O
do O
not O
go O
back! O

had O
ordered O
a O
brunch, O
food B-TARGET
was O
tiptop, O
plenty B-TARGET
of O
drink. O

other O
people O
sat O
exactly O
at O
our O
food B-TARGET

The O
old O
cafe O
was O
cozy O
and O
honest. O

Now O
it O
is O
a O
refectory O
without O
character. O

At O
23.30h O
the O
chairs O
are O
put O
on O
the O
table O
upside O
down. O

A O
sign O
that O
you O
can O
gradually O
leave. O

A O
half B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
half I-TARGET
is O
only O
1/3rd O
triple O
supplemented O
with O
trappist O
from O
the O
barrel. O

And O
it O
is O
far O
too O
expensive. O

Too O
bad O
this O
has O
evolved O
so O
much.... O

I O
can't O
say O
much O
about O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
are O
quite O
expensive O
in O
comparison. O

We O
are O
more O
than O
satisfied O
with O
our O
evening O
in O
the O
Gempemolen B-TARGET
. O

We O
were O
warmly O
welcomed O
and O
very O
kindly O
served O
throughout O
the O
evening. O

After O
the O
soup O
the O
four O
of O
us O
chose O
the O
boar B-TARGET
tenderloin: I-TARGET
juicy O
and O
with O
lots O
of O
nice O
vegetables. B-TARGET

One O
person O
chose O
a O
vegetarian B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
and O
she O
was O
also O
very O
enthusiastic. O

We O
got O
all O
the O
time O
to O
eat O
quietly O
and O
really O
enjoyed O
it. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake. O

Price/quality O
highly O
recommended! O

Although O
this O
Brasserie B-TARGET
is O
operated O
by O
the O
Meus O
Clan O
it O
does O
not O
meet O
our O
expectations. O

Environment B-TARGET
and O
interior B-TARGET
are O
more O
than O
ok, O
food B-TARGET
is O
less O
enthusiastic O
about. O

Pity O

You O
will O
find O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
prepared O
with O
great O
skill O
and O
enthusiasm O
and O
served O
with O
style. O

Obtaining O
a O
Michelin O
star O
has O
not O
gone O
to O
Lieven B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Iris' I-TARGET
heads. O

The O
prices O
are O
always O
correct O
and O
even O
very O
reasonable. O

In O
short: O
all O
go O
there! O

Despite O
not O
making O
a O
reservation O
we O
got O
a O
table O
on O
a O
busy O
evening. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
served O
at O
an O
acceptable O
time, O
and O
everything O
was O
as O
expected. O

Perhaps O
opt O
to O
serve O
slightly O
less O
bulky O
fries B-TARGET
(no O
extra O
charge O
:-)) O

Other O
than O
that, O
everything O
was O
to O
our O
liking. O

We O
were O
served O
a O
super O
delicious O
dish B-TARGET
in O
no O
time. O

It O
was O
all O
fresh O
and O
certainly O
sufficient. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly. O

Upon O
entering O
not O
very O
friendly O
received. O

It O
was O
quite O
busy. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
was O
incredibly O
angry O
with O
his O
staff. O

We O
are O
with O
his O
six O
then O
immediately O
left. O

Due O
to O
circumstances O
I O
have O
been O
here O
with O
several O
friends O
three O
times O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
few O
weeks O
and O
have O
been O
able O
to O
taste O
both O
a O
lunch O
(outside), O
a O
la O
carte O
and O
a O
menu. O

Everyone O
agreed O
that O
Le B-TARGET
Kok I-TARGET
is O
truly O
a O
special O
asset O
in O
the O
De O
Haan O
area. O

The O
chef B-TARGET
has O
clearly O
found O
a O
golden O
mean O
to O
not O
only O
serve O
the O
beautiful O
presentations, O
but O
also O
to O
excellently O
teach O
the O
flavors. O

Truly O
very O
refined O
in O
all O
respects. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
quiet. O

Although O
not O
indicated, O
one O
can O
park O
at O
the O
adjacent O
plant O
and O
garden O
company. O

The O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
good. O

Very O
professional O
hostess B-TARGET
and O
good O
service B-TARGET
, O
although O
once O
the O
principle, O
first-in, O
first-served O
was O
not O
applied O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
crowds. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
also O
here, O
the O
more O
common O
rule O
applies: O
that O
with O
four O
or O
all O
choose O
à O
la O
carte O
or O
all O
menu. O

But O
this O
will O
not O
stop O
me O
from O
coming O
back O
for O
sure. O

Here O
we O
ate O
very O
well. O

Restaurant B-TARGET
with O
open O
kitchen O
and O
quiet O
setting. O

Come O
back O
here O
for O
sure. O

Mussels O
with O
fries B-TARGET
ordered, O
fries O
downright O
limp O
and O
fat, O
no O
mussel B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
because O
the O
chef B-TARGET
was O
in O
a O
bad O
mood, O
mayo B-TARGET
with O
chunks,.... O
My O
husband O
was O
still O
good! O

After O
another O
time O
we O
asked O
for O
vinegar O
with O
some O
dressing O
in O
it, O
again O
and O
we O
asked O
for O
mayo B-TARGET
and O
got O
mayo O
with O
chunks O
and O
condition, O
again, O
my O
husband O
says O
but O
customer O
is O
still O
king, O
rude O
and O
the O
answer O
of O
the O
chef, B-TARGET
but O
I O
am O
emperor! O

Then O
he O
kept O
shouting! O

and O
my O
husband O
says O
if O
that's O
how O
it O
is, O
we O
just O
leave! O

man O
comes O
outside, O
I O
say O
good, O
come, O
the O
children O
are O
hungry, O
just O
eat, O
one B-TARGET
comes O
in, O
now O

Pay O

Man O

still O
eating! O

who O
starts O
throwing O
chairs!!!!!!! O

man O
pays O
and O
garcon B-TARGET
takes O
away O
all O
food!!!!! O

then O
suddenly O
all O
the O
waiters, O
boss O
and O
chef O
pass O
by O
us!!!!! O

boss B-TARGET
with O
baseball O
bat O
past O
me!!!!!!!!!! O

..80€ O
lost, O
evening O
to O
hell O
and O
parents O
and O
children O
shocked!!! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
super, O
could O
not O
have O
been O
better! O

Maybe O
1 O
minus O
point O
the O
lady B-TARGET
asked O
only O
to O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
a O
coffee O
(although O
we O
were O
4 O
without O
asking O
the O
other O
table O
companions O
that O
question, O
she O
was O
also O
a O
bit O
fast O
away) O
so O
everyone O
got O
coffee. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
needs O
to O
behave O
a O
bit O
calmer. O

Otherwise O
top! O

Nice O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Food B-TARGET
was O
perfect, O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about. O

Very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
hand O
cut O
. O

We O
will O
definitely O
return. O

We O
were O
warmly O
welcomed, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
tastefully O
decorated. O

With O
the O
aperitif O
came O
a O
whole O
series O
of O
beautiful O
and O
delicious O
appetizers B-TARGET
. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
itself O
was O
of O
the O
same O
level, O
without O
one O
minus O
point. O

My O
wife O
requested O
custom B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
in O
small O
quantities, O
which O
they O
served O
spontaneously, O
and O
charged O
a O
very O
correct O
price O
afterwards. O

Chapeau O
for O
everything! O

Enjoyed O
a O
wonderful O
evening O
at O
The B-TARGET
Bistronomy I-TARGET
! O

Surprising O
flavor B-TARGET
combinations I-TARGET
beautifully O
presented O
on O
the O
perfect O
plate! O

Looking O
for O
a O
unique O
total O
experience? O

This B-TARGET
is O
THE O
place O
to O
be! O

Our O
party O
got O
to O
experience O
the O
surprising O
tricks O
of O
the O
robot B-TARGET
hostess I-TARGET
, O
never O
seen O
before O
! O

This O
is O
my O
2nd O
review. O

This O
time O
horrible. O

We O
sat O
there O
from O
19.30 O
and O
at O
22h O
they O
come O
and O
say O
she O
forgot O
your O
order. O

So O
after O
all O
these O
negative O
reviews. O

Please O
disregard O
it. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
was O
always O
giving O
3xcuses O
a O
h. O

But O
there O
is O
no O
manager O

Short O
summary: O
ill-mannered, O
unprofessional O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
bad O
food B-TARGET
(sick O
next O
day). O

Brief O
summary: O
ill-mannered, O
unprofessional O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
bad O
food B-TARGET
(sick O
next O
day). O

We O
went O
to O
the O
Chi-Chi's O
chain O
more O
often O
in O
other O
communities O
and O
were O
generally O
satisfied. O

Chi-Chi's B-TARGET
Wemmel I-TARGET
recently O
opened O
its O
doors, O
maybe O
that's O
why O
the O
quality O
is O
so O
low. O

Tip O
to O
the O
manager: O
give O
training O
to O
staff B-TARGET
(both O
kitchen O
and O
hall) O
if O
you O
want O
to O
keep O
the O
restaurant O
open. O

Sad O
to O
eat O
there! O

We O
were O
there O
with O
a O
Flair O
voucher O
(buffet O
+ O
non-alcoholic O
cocktail O
for O
€8). O

We O
arrived O
and O
first O
had O
to O
wait O
about O
5 O
minutes O
before O
there O
was O
any O
staff B-TARGET
in O
the O
room O
at O
all. O

We O
had O
made O
reservations O
and O
so O
wanted O
to O
know O
where O
we O
could O
sit. O

Eventually O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
choose O
and O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
only O
table O
where O
there O
were O
no O
dirty O
plates O
on O
the O
table O
and O
where O
the O
tables O
had O
been O
cleaned. O

This O
we O
found O
already O
quite O
unpleasant. O

Then O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
another O
15 O
minutes O
until O
(French O
language...) O
cards O
were O
brought. O

Then O
another O
20 O
minutes O
before O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
done O
talking O
and O
had O
time O
to O
take O
our O
order. O

We O
had O
thus O
taken O
the O
buffet O
and O
a O
non-alcoholic O
cocktail. O

We O
got O
the O
cocktail O
when O
we O
were O
almost O
done O
eating O
(and O
we O
are O
not O
fast O
eaters). O

The O
buffet B-TARGET
was O
pathetic. O

Choice O
of O
5 O
hot O
dishes O
and O
about O
six O
cold O
dishes. O

Almost O
everything O
was O
gone, O
and O
what O
was O
left O
was O
dried O
out, O
burned O
on, O
or O
already O
cold. O

After O
we O
had O
eaten O
our O
first O
plate, O
we O
were O
anxious O
to O
go O
back O
and O
scoop O
up O
more. O

This O
was O
not O
possible O
because O
we O
were O
out O
of O
EVERYTHING. O

And O
we O
could O
not O
take O
much O
the O
first O
time O
because O
there O
was O
already O
not O
much. O

My O
friend O
asked O
several O
times O
in O
Dutch O
when O
it O
would O
be O
refilled, O
only O
to O
be O
told O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
did O
not O
understand O
Dutch. O

Then O
we O
tried O
in O
French O
and O
they O
went O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
restock O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
tired O
of O
waiting O
after O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
we O
left O
ravenously O
hungry. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
we O
were O
both O
sick O
for O
3 O
more O
days O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
obviously O
not O
kept O
at O
a O
hygienic O
temperature O
in O
the O
buffet. O

Further O
also O
very O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O
staff B-TARGET
. O

There O
was O
a O
girl B-TARGET
who O
deliberately O
skipped O
our O
table O
(and O
sometimes O
just O
stood O
there O
not O
talking) O
because O
she O
did O
not O
want O
to O
speak O
Dutch. O

And O
this O
while O
there O
were O
still O
dirty O
plates O
everywhere O
and O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time. O

Moreover, O
the O
napkins B-TARGET
on O
our O
table O
were O
already O
used O
and O
just O
folded O
again O
and O
the O
cards B-TARGET
were O
very O
sticky. O

First O
and O
last O
time O
we O
went! O

Very O
nice, O
perfunctory O
service B-TARGET
, O
very O
refined O
dishes B-TARGET
! O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back. O

Person O
X O
from O
Y. O

Today O
we O
had O
a O
birthday O
party. O

So O
nice O
to O
eat O
out O
together. O

We O
reserved O
a O
table O
and O
thought O
we O
would O
enjoy O
it. O

At O
18 O
o'clock O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table. O

After O
we O
had O
found O
the O
menus O
ourselves, O
we O
asked O
at O
6:30 O
if O
we O
could O
order. O

Ten O
minutes O
later O
we O
asked O
again. O

The O
starter B-TARGET
was O
ok. O

On O
the O
main O
course O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
three O
quarters O
of O
an O
hour O
after O
repeatedly O
asking. O

Small O
portions, B-TARGET
half O
raw O
meat, B-TARGET
in O
short: O
worthless. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
wilted, O
the O
fries B-TARGET
from O
the O
freezer. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
unfriendly, O
always O
starts O
discussing O
with O
the O
guests. O

My O
second O
Leefe B-TARGET
from O
the O
barrel O
came O
in O
a O
bottle! O

In O
short: O
really O
worthless. O

Never O
again. O

we O
were O
with O
a O
large O
group O
but O
the O
different O
choices O
of O
the O
participants O
were O
passed O
on O
in O
advance. O

The O
puff O
pastry O
of O
the O
queen O
appetizer O
was O
top O
the O
rest B-TARGET
was O
not O
to O
write O
home O
about O
prefab O
meatballs, O
little O
sauce, O
no O
mushroom O
to O
detect, O
a O
little O
chicken O
The O
fries O
were O
below O
standard, O
tasteless O
cardboard O
There O
are O
plenty O
of O
other O
options O
nearby, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
with O
a O
small O
group O
also O
for O
larger O
groups O
there O
must O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
in O
Maaseik. O

Beautiful O
quiet O
decor, B-TARGET
beautiful O
cutlery, B-TARGET
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
but O
above O
all O
very O
tasty O
dishes! B-TARGET

With O
the O
5 O
courses O
I O
would O
have O
had O
more O
than O
enough O
but O
we O
went O
for O
the O
7 O
with O
adapted O
wines. O
