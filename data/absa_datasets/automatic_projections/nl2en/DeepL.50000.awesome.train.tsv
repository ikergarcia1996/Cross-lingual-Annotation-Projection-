Breakfast B-TARGET
buffet I-TARGET
was O
tip O
top O
in O
order O
. O

Not O
cheap! O

Via O
via O
we O
had O
heard O
that O
we O
had O
to O
be O
here O
for O
Wagye O
beef. O

Our O
GPS O
was O
not O
the O
best O
guide O
to O
get O
to O
Altembrouck O
Castle. O

But O
once O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
castle B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
it O
was O
a O
feast. O

First O
of O
all O
the O
service, B-TARGET
exceptionally O
friendly O
attentive O
not O
forced O
but O
real. O

Rarely O
experienced, O
between O
the O
staff B-TARGET
there O
was O
a O
wonderful O
teasing O
chemistry. O

You O
have O
the O
choice O
between O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
menus. B-TARGET

Specialization O
are O
the O
Wagye O
cattle. O

If O
you O
ask O
for O
an O
explanation O
about O
this O
delicious O
beef, B-TARGET
the O
meat O
is O
presented O
to O
you O
on O
a O
plate O
beforehand. O

It O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
it O
is O
exceptionally O
tasty. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
a O
steak O
lover O
there O
is O
a O
fish O
alternative B-TARGET
, O
duck B-TARGET
and O
lamb B-TARGET
at O
acceptable O
prices. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
a O
good O
selection O
of O
tasty O
quality O
wines B-TARGET
. O

It O
had O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
we O
ate O
so O
well. O

On O
the O
border O
between O
the O
Netherlands O
and O
Belgium O
we O
had O
exceptionally O
good O
food O
in O
an O
atmospheric O
setting B-TARGET
with O
a O
live O
band O
that O
found O
the O
right O
tone O
and O
gave O
us O
a O
wonderful O
afternoon. O

This O
is O
the O
3rd O
time O
we O
have O
eaten O
here. O

It O
is O
a O
fantastic O
place B-TARGET
. O

When O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
eat O
or O
drink O
outside O
in O
the O
courtyard O
or O
by O
the O
pond. O

On O
the O
Altembrouck O
estate O
they O
work O
with O
fresh O
honest O
products B-TARGET
. O

They O
have O
majalica O
(curly O
hair) O
pigs O
and O
wagyu O
cattle. O

There O
is O
no O
menu. B-TARGET

On O
Sunday O
there O
is O
a O
3 B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
for O
27.50 O
which O
is O
really O
price O
quality. O

Disadvantage O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
menu B-TARGET
even O
daily. O

If O
the O
host O
has O
listed O
what O
there O
is O
to O
eat O
you O
are O
before O
he O
or O
she O
is O
at O
the O
dessert O
lost O
what O
the O
main O
course O
is. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
correct O
without O
being O
stiff. O

The O
only O
pity O
is O
that O
last O
time O
they O
mentioned O
both O
pork O
and O
beef O
as O
main O
courses O
and O
our O
whole O
table O
thought O
it O
was O
strange O
that O
they O
didn't O
ask O
us O
what O
our O
preference O
was. O

Inquiry O
learned O
that O
the O
beef O
was O
unfortunately O
already O
sold O
out. O

Furthermore, O
and O
very O
flexible O
3 O
pers O
wanted O
to O
go O
(with O
extra O
payment) O
for O
the O
starter O
of O
the O
Easter O
menu. O

That O
all O
went. O

Still, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
must O
to O
at O
least O
put O
something O
like O
an O
Easter O
menu O
on O
the O
website. O

Now O
you O
have O
to O
call O
or O
mail O
for O
it, O
which O
is O
not O
very O
commercial. O

For O
the O
rest O
nothing O
but O
praise. O

So O
delicious O
imaginatively O
served O
food B-TARGET
in O
a O
fine O
ambiance. B-TARGET

I O
can O
only O
recommend O
this O
place. O

Do O
you O
come O
here O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
or O
a O
salad O
.... O
also O
fine. O

Just O
do O
it O
once O
and O
be O
surprised. O

Too O
bad, O
such O
a O
case, O
beautifully O
situated, O
good O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
the O
friendliness O
of O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
shame O
and O
unprofessional, O

We O
had O
a O
Swiss O
guest O
at O
our O
house. O

He O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
with O
the O
tour O
he O
received O
in O
Halle. O

Especially O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
Cardin O
spent O
his O
childhood O
in O
Halle, O
the O
beautiful O
St. O
Martin's O
Basilica. O

He O
knew O
the O
music O
of O
Servais O
but O
did O
not O
know O
that O
Servais O
still O
stank O
here. O

The O
idea O
of O
ending O
this O
beautiful O
evening O
with O
a O
dinner O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
"t B-TARGET
Groot I-TARGET
Caf√©" I-TARGET
was O
a O
real O
disappointment. O

I O
thought O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
had O
just O
been O
fired. O

So O
unfriendly O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
abusive. O

Apparently O
he O
still O
works O
there. O
He's O
certainly O
not O
more O
sympathetic. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
also O
not O
really O
or O
did O
the O
service B-TARGET
here O
a O
role. O

As O
long O
as O
that O
waiter B-TARGET
continues O
to O
work O
there O
I O
am O
not O
seen O
again. O

We O
came O
with O
9 O
people O
for O
a O
bite O
to O
eat. O

What O
a O
horrible O
experience. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
downright O
rude O
and O
went O
out O
of O
his O
way O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
that O
he O
didn't O
feel O
like O
serving O
us. O

When O
we O
said, O
yes, O
if O
it O
is O
too O
difficult O
to O
serve O
us, O
we O
could O
not O
finish O
our O
sentence O
but O
were O
yelled O
at O
by O
the O
ear O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
then O
turned O
and O
left. O

The O
other O
customers O
said O
out O
loud O
that O
it O
was O
outrageous O
and O
unbelievable O
that O
they O
chased O
a O
group O
of O
9 O
people O
out O
so O
clearly! O

Any O
other O
restaurant O
with O
any O
dignity O
would O
welcome O
9 O
customers O
at O
7:20pm O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
with O
open O
arms! O

If O
this O
business B-TARGET
cannot O
keep O
its O
head O
above O
water, O
it O
is O
not O
because O
of O
the O
crisis! O

Owner, O
teach O
your O
staff B-TARGET
manners. O

We O
come O
here O
often O
to O
eat: O
decent O
brasserie B-TARGET
without O
more. O

Everything O
is O
ok O
but O
you O
never O
get O
a O
real O
'wow-feeling'. O

The O
establishment O
clearly O
runs O
on O
regular O
(older) O
customers O
and O
is O
satisfied O
with O
this. O

In O
short: O
you O
will O
never O
be O
disappointed O
but O
you O
will O
also O
never O
be O
in O
the O
'clouds'. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
gave O
us O
a O
free O
choice O
of O
tapas B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
she O
delivered O
quickly O
and O
although O
everything O
was O
tasty O
and O
of O
good O
quality, O
I O
missed O
refinement. O

We O
said O
at O
the O
beginning O
to O
love O
the O
combination O
tapa O
and O
fish O
and O
this O
was O
not O
addressed O
at O
all: O
iberico B-TARGET
, O
chorizo B-TARGET
, O
manchego B-TARGET
, O
Russian B-TARGET
egg I-TARGET
, O
mushrooms B-TARGET
, O
tomatoes B-TARGET
...., O
meatballs B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
, O
all O
tasty, O
however O
not O
authentic... O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
good, O
most O
expensive O
bottle O
still O
at O
fashionable O
price O
of O
30 O
eur..... O

So O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
address B-TARGET
for O
a O
pleasant O
chat O
and O
simple O
but O
tasty O
tapas. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
friendly O
but O
in O
a O
hurry.... O

Southern O
atmosphere B-TARGET
... O

Cosy O
and O
tasty. O

Great O
concept B-TARGET
for O
a O
great O
evening O
in O
Spanish O
decor!!! O

Definitely O
come O
back O

Wonderful O
wines B-TARGET
and O
very O
cozy O
ambiente B-TARGET
. O

Authentic O
recipes B-TARGET
(as O
Spanish O
experts O
we O
can O
confirm O
that) O
and O
everything O
homemade O
(you O
can O
taste O
that!). O

Highly O
recommended O
for O
an O
evening O
out! O

Nice O
concept, B-TARGET
very O
nice O
wines B-TARGET
and O
tapas, B-TARGET
these O
change O
regularly O
sometimes O
very O
good O
others O
just O
good. O

Always O
come O
back O
to O
spend O
a O
cozy O
evening O
with O
snack O
and O
drink, O
the O
service B-TARGET
could O
sometimes O
be O
faster, O
but O
look O
at O
this O
as O
a O
fun O
and O
relaxing O
afternoon O
or O
evening O
without O
stress O

Antwerp O
metropolis O
is O
a O
fantastic O
city O
for O
gastronomes. O

Also O
in O
the O
periphery O
there O
are O
gems O
like O
Klein B-TARGET
Constantia I-TARGET
. O

Although O
aimed O
rather O
at O
a O
modal O
audience O
that O
likes O
to O
eat O
a O
steak, O
this O
restaurant O
presents O
with O
regularity O
taste O
paradises O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
gastronomes. O

And O
for O
amateurs O
of O
South O
African O
wines O
with O
fruity O
flavors, O
be O
sure O
to O
try O
Provenance O
Rooi. O

Simply O
the O
best O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
area! O

Passion O
for O
food O
and O
matching O
drinks O
in O
a O
cozy O
setting. O

Different O
but O
oh O
so O
delicious!!!! O

Past O
visits O
to O
KC B-TARGET
were O
always O
a O
culinary O
highlight. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
same O
can O
no O
longer O
be O
said O
of O
the O
last O
visit. O

The O
swung O
is O
apparently O
out O
of O
it. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
far O
too O
limited, O
suggestions B-TARGET
have O
disappeared, O
as O
has O
the O
creativity O
on O
the O
plate B-TARGET
. O

A O
simple O
salad B-TARGET
as O
a O
side O
dish O
is O
not O
immediately O
my O
motivation O
to O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant. O

Amuses B-TARGET
that O
used O
to O
be O
a O
nice O
entree O
are O
now O
limited O
to O
a O
pumpkin O
soup. O

But O
even O
with O
this O
limited O
menu B-TARGET
(4 O
main O
courses, O
4 O
starters O
and O
2 O
desserts) O
there O
were O
still O
2 O
dishes O
not O
available! O

But O
very O
annoying, O
this O
was O
not O
mentioned O
in O
advance O
when O
the O
menu O
was O
presented. O

Even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
main O
course, O
this O
was O
only O
reported O
at O
the O
time O
it O
was O
to O
be O
served! O

Here O
is O
the O
menu O
choose O
but O
something O
else. O

No, O
this O
is O
3 O
steps O
backwards O
compared O
to O
previous O
visits. O

If O
it O
is O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
owner O
to O
go O
for O
a O
brasserie O
that O
is O
his O
choice, O
but O
as O
now O
betting O
on O
2 O
horses, O
it O
simply O
does O
not O
work. O

A O
great O
pity. O

On O
the O
positive O
side, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
is O
ok O
and O
the O
wide O
choice O
of O
South B-TARGET
African I-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
. O

We O
went O
for O
the O
second O
time O
to O
eat. O

Last O
time O
the O
Royal O
all O
in O
menu, O
this O
time O
the O
all O
in O
menu. O

Tip O
top O
order O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
cava O
with O
waiting O
plate, O
starter, O
main O
course O
and O
dessert O
or O
irish O
coffee. O

Water O
and O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine O
included O
for O
32‚Ç¨. O

Very O
friendly O
and O
smooth O
service. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended! O

In O
the O
previous O
establishment O
the O
kitchen O
and O
service O
was O
at O
restaurant O
level. O

Now O
it O
is O
not O
even O
worthy O
of O
a O
brasserie O
rating. O

With O
family O
(6 O
people) O
we O
went O
for O
dinner O
and O
it O
was O
really O
disappointing. O

Tasty O
sandwich B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vol-au-vent I-TARGET
At O
8.5 O
‚Ç¨! O

Expensive. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
not O
friendly. O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
ok O
but O
not O
so O
pleasant O

The B-TARGET
Village, I-TARGET
a O
real O
winner! O

Cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
TOP! O

Romance O
or O
coziness, O
just O
enjoy,...alaise!!! O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work! O

I O
used O
to O
eat O
regularly O
at O
the O
zuiderparel, O
now O
the O
concept O
has O
changed O
to O
eatery O
which O
also O
means O
that O
the O
menu O
has O
changed O
completely. O

But O
must O
be O
honest, O
it O
was O
and O
remains O
top O
to O
eat O
here. O

Beautiful O
decoration O
of O
the O
case, B-TARGET
super O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
something O
for O
everyone O
on O
the O
card. B-TARGET

What O
I O
personally O
like O
here O
is O
the O
Tapas B-TARGET
platter I-TARGET
, O
but O
also O
their O
village B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
accompanying I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
, O
their O
mussels B-TARGET
and O
the O
legendary O
Pelt B-TARGET
stew I-TARGET
is O
super O
tasty. O

Also O
the O
coziness O
of O
sitting O
in O
the O
sofa O
or O
hanging O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
enjoying O
a O
nice O
Cocktail, B-TARGET
it's O
all O
here. O

Tanja B-TARGET
, O
you O
are O
doing O
well!!!!! O

We O
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
reservation O
with O
four O
people O
for O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
at O
formerly O
the O
zuiderparel O
(phone O
didn't O
work O
several O
times)!!!! O

Or O
they O
just O
didn't O
answer. O

We O
took O
action O
and O
left O
anyway, O
hoping O
there O
was O
still O
room! O

And O
yes O
there O
was O
certainly O
room O
(3 O
hours O
with O
four O
people O
in O
the O
case) O
we O
were O
very O
well O
received O
the O
guard B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
duty I-TARGET
was O
also O
the O
only O
liable O
in O
the O
case! O

The O
case B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
but O
cool O
because O
there O
was O
no O
people O
to O
stay: O
the O
food B-TARGET
just O
SHANDAL!!!! O

Lettuce B-TARGET
from O
the O
aldi O
the O
quality O
was O
poor O
and O
the O
dressing B-TARGET
was O
already O
exactly O
month O
past O
its O
date! O

The O
home-made B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
were O
from O
the O
makro!!!! O

A O
female B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
member I-TARGET
was O
just O
smoking O
in O
the O
case B-TARGET
this O
is O
all O
a O
pity O
and O
for O
us O
Wker O
not O
repeatable. O

but O
a O
must O
if O
you O
like O
your O
privacy!!!! O

Both O
the O
concept B-TARGET
and O
the O
Interior B-TARGET
is O
original. O

Bart O
the O
owner O
does O
the O
venue O
and O
1 O
cook O
makes O
the O
dishes. O

Therefore O
small O
menu B-TARGET
with O
only O
super O
fresh O
plates. B-TARGET

The O
wine B-TARGET
choice I-TARGET
is O
fantastic O
and O
price O
quality O
is O
very O
correct. O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
friendly O
reception, B-TARGET
the O
best O
steak B-TARGET
tartare I-TARGET
we O
have O
ever O
eaten O
(the O
baked B-TARGET
you O
should O
definitely O
try!), O
wine B-TARGET
adapted O
to O
your O
taste, O
... O

In O
short, O
an O
absolute O
must! O

Great O
restaurant B-TARGET
outside O
the O
real O
center O
of O
Antwerp. O

Sublime, O
relaxed O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
few O
seats B-TARGET
(reservations O
required) O
and O
a O
fantastic O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
top O
(that O
steak B-TARGET
tartare!) I-TARGET
And O
it O
is O
wonderful O
to O
be O
surprised O
by O
their O
wine B-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
. O

Not O
a O
cheap O
place B-TARGET
, O
but O
price/quality O
very O
correct O
. O

An O
absolute O
must! O

In O
the O
afternoon O
we O
stopped O
for O
coffee. O

And O
yes O
in O
the O
Antwerp O
South, O
hip O
is O
not O
always O
equal O
to O
quality. O

The O
coffees B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
were O
in O
my O
opinion O
way O
too O
expensive O
and O
served O
too O
cold. O

Lukewarm O
coffee B-TARGET
is O
just O
not O
acceptable. O

Especially O
because O
the O
case O
was O
virtually O
empty, O
this O
is O
not O
acceptable. O

Also O
does O
not O
give O
a O
good O
impression O
that O
your O
counter O
is O
full O
of O
dishes O
of O
the O
past O
hours O
while O
there O
are O
about O
8 O
people O
in O
the O
case. O

I O
will O
not O
be O
seen O
here O
again. O

Portion O
of O
cake B-TARGET
was O
large O
enough O
and O
there O
was O
little O
to O
complain O
about. O

The O
only O
place O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
good O
pastrami, B-TARGET
which O
is O
served O
with O
a O
special O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
on O
thick O
slices O

The O
coffee B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
there O
is O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Nice O
for O
lunch. O

Delicious O
food O
at O
caffe O
internazionale. O

After O
checking O
out O
of O
the O
hotel O
we O
went O
to O
the O
cozy O
cafe. B-TARGET

Here O
we O
had O
an O
extensive O
breakfast O
and O
enjoyed O
a O
good O
cup O
of O
coffee. B-TARGET

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
like O
visiting O
friends O
at O
home. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
correct. O

Highly O
recommended O
for O
delicious O
breakfast, O
bruch O
and/or O
coffee! O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
√† I-TARGET
L'infintise I-TARGET
is O
a O
unique O
experience O
in O
all O
of O
Antwerp. O

For O
a O
reasonable O
price O
the O
chef O
serves O
us O
his O
culinary B-TARGET
creations I-TARGET
where O
his O
personal O
style O
comes O
into O
its O
own. O

Marc B-TARGET
is O
an O
artist O
who O
knows O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
flavors O
and O
appearance O
of O
good O
food B-TARGET
. O

You O
fall O
from O
one O
surprise O
into O
another. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is O
very O
original. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
very O
creative, O
delicious, O
I O
have O
no O
words O
for O
it. O

Friendly O
service B-TARGET
. O

I O
would O
love O
to O
come O
back O
here. O

Too O
bad O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
times I-TARGET
are O
so O
long. O

We O
have O
already O
made O
reservations O
for O
December. O

For O
me O
the O
chef B-TARGET
deserves O
4 O
stars. O

Nice O
decoration, O
enough O
choice, B-TARGET
good O
value O
for O
money. O

We O
fell O
in O
around O
21h O
so O
there O
was O
little O
people O
present. O

We O
came O
here O
yesterday O
with O
2 O
with O
a O
Grouponbon, O
menu O
with O
bottle O
of O
wine O
and O
half O
a O
liter O
of O
water. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
warm. O

The O
appetizer B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice, O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
also. O

Several O
very O
tasty O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
separate O
rice. O

Lots O
of O
vegetables. B-TARGET

Certainly O
enough O
for O
2 O
people. O
only O
minus: O
a O
bit O
little O
chicken B-TARGET
and O
scampi. B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
tough O
and O
no O
fresh O
chocolate B-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

But O
you O
have O
to O
keep O
price O
/ O
quality O
in O
mind O
... O

Service B-TARGET
SUPER O
friendly. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
scared O
after O
reading O
other O
comments, O
I O
can O
only O
prove O
them O
wrong. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
extensive, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back! O

There O
would O
just O
be O
a O
new B-TARGET
owner, I-TARGET
hence O
perhaps O
the O
positive O
that O
he O
strives. O

We O
wish O
him O
lots O
of O
success! O

It's O
a O
nice O
little O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
they O
serve O
good O
sushi B-TARGET
but O
that's O
about O
it. O

Often O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
special O
sauce O
but O
you O
don't O
get O
that O
here. O

You O
get O
2 O
hours O
to O
order O
your O
5 O
rounds O
but O
within O
those O
2 O
hours O
you O
only O
just O
get O
3 O
rounds O
because O
it O
takes O
so O
long. O

About O
30 O
minutes O
from O
ordering. O

In O
addition, O
all O
around O
the O
bar B-TARGET
there O
are O
dirty O
flies O
so O
I O
would O
not O
sit O
near O
there. O

The O
lady B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
though O
and O
we O
were O
even O
allowed O
to O
change O
tables O
during O
the O
crowds. O

When O
the O
restaurant O
is O
not O
full, O
then O
it O
is O
no O
problem O
to O
eat O
your O
fill O
at O
a O
relaxed O
pace. O

But O
when O
it O
gets O
a O
bit O
busier, O
the O
people B-TARGET
in O
both O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
service O
are O
short O
of O
hands. O

However, O
the O
people B-TARGET
try O
to O
help O
you O
with O
a O
smile O
where O
they O
can. O

The O
tables B-TARGET
don't O
always O
look O
clean, O
and O
here O
and O
there O
something O
needs O
replacing O
(like O
a O
creaking O
speaker). O

But O
it O
sounds O
worse O
than O
it O
is. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
good. O

So O
many O
different O
choices B-TARGET
, O
and O
the O
flavors B-TARGET
are O
right O
on. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
in O
itself O
may O
seem O
a O
little O
strange O
at O
first, O
and O
many O
think O
they O
won't O
have O
enough. O

But O
rest O
assured, O
your O
belly O
is O
full O
when O
you O
leave O
the O
place. O

When O
you O
read O
that O
some O
people O
"don't O
dare O
to O
order O
because O
they O
might O
have O
to O
impose O
1 O
euro O
if O
they O
don't O
get O
it", O
or O
"only O
drank O
water", O
those O
"only-with-discount" O
people O
can O
stay O
away O
from O
me O
for O
a O
large O
part, O
so O
that O
the O
rest O
will O
be O
served O
more O
quickly. O

Food O
is O
perfect, O
we O
love O
and O
enjoyed O
it O
and O
we O
will O
be O
back O
one O
day O
without O
a O
doubt! O

We O
got O
to O
eat B-TARGET
sooo O
much O
, O
perfect!!!! O

Shusi's B-TARGET
are O
good O
though O
one O
should O
be O
able O
to O
decide O
if O
it O
has O
wasabi O
and/or O
pepper O
on O
it. O

Hot B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
from O
microwave O
especially O
the O
skewers B-TARGET
and O
spare B-TARGET
ribs I-TARGET
were O
unappetizing. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
frequent O
shusi O
eater O
skip O
this O
place. B-TARGET

Pity O
of O
the O
expense O
incurred O
left O
without O
desert O
after O
3 O
rounds. O

Attracted O
by O
the O
nice O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
the O
street O
side O
and O
the O
delicious O
cheeses B-TARGET
in O
the O
showcase, O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch O
at O
this O
establishment. O

No O
menu, O
but O
just O
choose O
between O
the O
delicacies O
in O
the O
refrigerated O
counter, O
I O
took O
a O
tortellini B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pancetta I-TARGET
recommended O
by O
the O
manager, O
super O
tasty! O

This O
combined O
with O
nice O
music B-TARGET
in O
the O
background O
and O
a O
delicious O
glass O
of O
white B-TARGET
for O
a O
very O
correct O
price. O

Definitely O
to O
be O
tried! O

The O
taste O
nation O
is O
really O
something O
else! O

Nice O
address B-TARGET
for O
a O
lunch O
but O
also O
to O
get O
something B-TARGET
nice I-TARGET
to O
eat O
at O
home O
or O
a O
nice O
glass O
of O
wine B-TARGET
with O
an O
assortment O
of O
cheese O
to O
go O
with O
it! O

The O
owner O
does O
everything O
alone O
so O
he O
has O
his O
hands O
full! O

Therefore, O
the O
prices O
are O
also O
very O
democratic! O

Everything O
is O
still O
prepared O
in O
the O
traditional O
way! O

Also O
try O
one O
of O
the O
delicious O
pies B-TARGET
or O
quiches, B-TARGET
they O
are O
finger O
licking! O

In O
short, O
an O
absolute O
must! O

The O
beautiful O
location O
(Sint B-TARGET
Jorispoort) I-TARGET
drew O
us O
to O
the O
terrace. O

But O
the O
service B-TARGET
here O
hit O
everything. O

It O
seemed O
as O
if O
we O
disturbed O
the O
cook, B-TARGET
although O
there O
was O
no O
one O
next O
to O
us. O

He O
then O
had O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
not O
available O
because O
he O
was O
busy. O

People O
were O
looking O
over O
us. O

A O
glance, O
a O
smile, O
a O
"appetizing" O
or O
"thank O
you" O
were O
far O
from O
the O
norm. O

Maybe O
somewhere O
under O
a O
soured O
lemon.... O

In O
addition, O
there O
was O
the O
bill.... O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
had O
not O
asked O
the O
price O
of O
(5 O
euros O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine B-TARGET
we O
could O
accept) O
was O
a O
piece O
of O
focaccia B-TARGET
of O
5x5 O
cm O
or O
3 O
bites. O

This O
came O
down O
to O
a O
whopping O
8 O
euros O
per O
piece. O

As O
for O
the O
taste, O
which O
is O
so O
much O
vaunted, O
my O
soup B-TARGET
was O
as O
bland O
as O
in O
the O
average O
brasserie O
kitchen. O

The O
focaccia B-TARGET
was O
tasty, O
but O
that O
should O
be O
for O
a O
fortune. O

I O
wonder O
how O
long O
this O
wayward O
business B-TARGET
will O
last... O

If O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
original O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
lunch O
at O
lunchtime, O
you've O
come O
to O
the O
right O
place. O

The O
store B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
open I-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
is O
nicely O
decorated O
and O
the O
proprietor B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
in O
choosing O
the O
meal. O

Every O
day O
there O
are O
daily O
freshly O
prepared O
soups B-TARGET
, O
light O
meal B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
, O
quiches O
and O
there O
is O
also O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
cheeses B-TARGET
. O

Food O
can O
be O
eaten O
on O
site O
or O
takeaway. O

I O
chose O
the O
celeriac O
sage O
soup O
with O
honey O
from O
a O
local O
beekeeper O
and O
behind O
it O
a O
cheese O
board. O

The O
soup B-TARGET
was O
really O
super O
and O
the O
cheeses B-TARGET
, O
which O
the O
proprietor O
had O
selected, O
were O
also O
definitely O
in O
order. O

With O
friends O
we O
went O
for O
a O
terrace O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
high O
street, O
at O
the O
pedestrian O
tunnel. O

Good O
food, O
good O
drinks, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
honest O
cuisine, B-TARGET
great O
boss B-TARGET
---> O
Long O
live O
Steve! O

Nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
interior I-TARGET
is O
modern. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
casual O
in O
style, O
and O
friendly. O

Sometimes O
it O
takes O
a O
while O
before O
you O
have O
their O
attention O
if O
you O
want O
to O
order O
something O
extra. O

The O
tables B-TARGET
are O
like O
in O
many O
places O
in O
Antwerp O
very O
small. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
fine O
though. O

Tasty O
cheese B-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
beforehand. O

LMain B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
stew I-TARGET
also O
delicious. O

We O
have O
something O
to O
celebrate O
and O
decide O
to O
do O
this O
at O
Sombat. O

After O
all, O
this O
restaurant O
is O
number O
1 O
on O
TripAdvisor O
for O
Antwerp. O

The O
expectations O
are O
thus O
high O
and O
that O
is O
not O
always O
without O
risk. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
where O
you O
just O
walk O
in, O
advance O
reservations O
are O
required. O

With O
only O
12 O
seats, O
this O
is O
understandable. O

Upon O
arrival, O
the O
facade O
of O
this O
beautiful O
mansion O
in O
nothing O
suggests O
that O
behind O
it O
a O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
hidden. O

We O
are O
kindly O
and O
with O
typical O
oriental O
politeness O
received O
by O
Sombat. B-TARGET

The O
garden B-TARGET
with O
pond O
behind O
is O
beautiful, O
unfortunately O
it O
is O
too O
cold O
outside O
and O
we O
take O
the O
aperitif O
in O
the O
leather O
lounge. O

This O
is O
a O
delicious O
cava B-TARGET
and O
included O
in O
the O
set-menu O
price O
at O
‚Ç¨50.00 O
per O
person. O

Meanwhile, O
we O
sample O
the O
interior. O

This O
is O
beautiful, O
soothing O
and O
exudes O
an O
authentic O
Thai O
setting. O

It O
has O
more O
of O
a O
living O
room O
atmosphere O
than O
a O
formal O
restaurant. O

The O
whole B-TARGET
thing I-TARGET
offers O
a O
high O
living O
room O
feel, O
it's O
cozy O
sitting O
here. O

We O
are O
seated O
at O
a O
table O
of O
4 O
with O
an O
unusual O
but O
nice O
shape. O

Each O
can O
talk O
to O
anyone O
without O
any O
problems. O

Here O
we O
go. O

The O
2 O
appetizers B-TARGET
beforehand O
are O
fresh O
and O
very O
tasty O
in O
taste. O

The O
host O
Sombat O
tells O
us O
that O
the O
menu O
tonight O
includes O
5 O
courses. O

We O
start O
with O
"Chicken O
soup O
with O
cocomut, O
galanka, O
lemongrass, O
time, O
chili O
and O
coriandre". O

This O
is O
quite O
a O
spicy O
soup B-TARGET
, O
acceptably O
spicy O
and O
subtle O
in O
flavor. O

Then O
comes O
"spicy O
seafood O
salad O
with O
vermicelli O
and O
herbes". O

This O
dish B-TARGET
is O
the O
better O
work. O

We O
continue O
with O
"chicken O
and O
vegetable O
wrapped O
in O
rice O
paper, O
sweet O
and O
sour O
sauce". O

Well O
prepared. O

The O
parade O
of O
starters O
ends O
with O
"deep O
fried O
shrimps O
with O
curry O
served O
with O
cucumber O
sauce". O

Again, O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about. O

The O
main O
course O
comes O
with O
"grilled O
scottish O
beef O
served O
with O
soya O
sauce O
and O
chilli O
powder, O
seafood O
saut√© O
with O
chilli O
and O
basil, O
sauth√© O
of O
fish O
filet O
with O
coconut O
in O
banana O
leaves O
and O
fresh O
vegetables O
with O
s√©same O
oil". O

This O
is O
where O
it O
goes O
wrong. O

The O
amount B-TARGET
of O
food O
is O
too O
generous, O
and O
I O
always O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
wasted O
food. O

Also, O
the O
harmony O
in O
terms O
of O
texture O
and O
flavor O
expression O
between O
the O
(too) O
numerous O
ingredients B-TARGET
goes O
completely O
awry. O

Too O
bad, O
but O
this O
dish B-TARGET
is O
not O
successful. O

We O
drink O
a O
white O
Pouilly O
Fuiss√© O
and O
a O
red O
Sancerre O
with O
it. O

Both O
are O
excellent O
and O
moderately O
priced. O

We O
finish O
with O
an O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
composition I-TARGET
which O
is O
very O
tasty. O

Prompt O
cognac O
of O
the O
house O
is O
offered O
with O
the O
coffee, O
very O
thoughtful. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
courteous O
and O
polite, O
albeit O
on O
the O
timid O
side. O

This O
' O
Home B-TARGET
Cooking' I-TARGET
concept I-TARGET
is O
a O
something O
different O
from O
a O
formal O
restaurant. O

The O
ingredients B-TARGET
used O
are O
fresh O
and O
in O
themselves O
all O
tastefully O
prepared. O

But O
the O
harmony B-TARGET
is O
not O
always O
right O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
too O
generous. O

All O
in O
all, O
the O
better O
Thai B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
, O
but O
it O
is O
just O
not O
sophisticated O
gastronomy. O

However, O
this O
will O
not O
stop O
me O
from O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
on O
occasion. O

After O
reading O
the O
numerous O
positive O
comments, O
I O
made O
a O
last O
minute O
reservation. O

Top O
hospitality, B-TARGET
relaxing O
indoor O
and O
outdoor O
surroundings B-TARGET
and O
food B-TARGET
to O
dream O
about. O

Our O
discovery O
of O
the O
year. O

Satisfied O
in O
all O
respects O

Upon O
entering O
you O
immediately O
feel O
like O
you O
are O
in O
Thailand. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
stylish O
and O
cozy, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
garden B-TARGET
where O
we O
had O
our O
aperitif. O

The O
food B-TARGET
(4 O
course O
menu O
for O
50‚Ç¨) O
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
not O
too O
"spicy". O

The O
host B-TARGET
and O
his O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
obliging O
and O
friendly. O

Sombat B-TARGET
Thai I-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
highly O
recommended O
and O
we O
will O
definitely O
go O
back. O

We O
enjoyed O
an O
excellent O
lunch B-TARGET
with O
a O
super O
delicious O
dessert B-TARGET
. O

The O
custom B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
very O
friendly O
and O
we O
were O
lucky O
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
the O
courtyard. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended. O

Don't O
let O
the O
busy O
surroundings B-TARGET
put O
you O
off. O

We O
had O
chosen O
a O
4-course O
menu. O

Since O
I O
am O
not O
allowed O
to O
eat O
mussels O
this O
was O
easily O
replaced O
with O
another O
dish. O

I O
asked O
the O
sommelier O
what O
wine O
he O
suggested O
from O
around O
50‚Ç¨. O

This O
was O
with O
the O
cheapest O
one O
on O
the O
menu O
though. O

Either O
that O
or O
the O
other, O
but O
I O
also O
have O
a O
Barbera O
of O
36‚Ç¨. O

So O
why O
wasn't O
that O
one O
on O
the O
menu? O

The O
amuses B-TARGET
and O
also O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
had O
a O
refined O
taste. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
were O
not O
very O
big O
though. O

But O
when O
I O
was O
served O
the O
Irish B-TARGET
beef, I-TARGET
my O
4 O
pieces O
(7x O
2 O
cm) O
were O
full O
of O
sinews O
which O
one O
could O
not O
cut O
with O
a O
knife. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
waiter. O

And O
a O
few O
minutes O
later, O
the O
chef B-TARGET
came O
with O
4 O
beautiful O
pieces O
of O
meat. B-TARGET

It O
was O
impossible O
that O
he O
had O
not O
seen O
it O
when O
he O
put O
it O
on O
the O
plate. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
also O
excellent O
in O
flavor O
combination. O

Again O
a O
pleasant O
experience. O

Masterpieces O
of O
taste, O
composition, O
combinations O
are O
conjured O
up O
on O
your O
plate. O

Gourmets O
and O
epicureans O
are O
sure O
to O
find O
this O
top O
notch! O

Wines B-TARGET
of O
excellent O
quality O
complete O
your O
menu. O

Highly O
recommended O
in O
a O
relaxed O
atmosphere B-TARGET
but O
with O
style. O

The O
address B-TARGET
for O
that O
one O
special O
occasion, O
enjoy O
together O
and O
be O
spoiled. O

The O
location B-TARGET
on O
a O
busy O
road O
is O
a O
drawback, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
not O
recommended. O

But O
the O
Indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
incredibly O
friendly. O

Communication O
with O
the O
customer O
is O
important O
and O
your O
satisfaction O
is O
really O
their O
concern. O

That O
is O
why O
I O
always O
like O
to... O

Good O
mussels, B-TARGET
good O
service, B-TARGET
that's O
real O
Hasselt O
hospitality! B-TARGET

Also O
a O
great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
music! I-TARGET

In O
short, O
a O
beautiful O
setting O
for O
the O
gang O
of O
San O
Miguel! O

Delicious O
sandwiches B-TARGET
and O
pastas. B-TARGET

Price O
quality O
is O
very O
good! O

Also O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
cheap. O

It O
is O
located O
on O
the O
shopping O
street O
so O
also O
very O
convenient O
while O
shopping. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
that O
around O
noon O
it O
is O
very O
busy. O

Here O
you O
have O
a O
wide O
choice O
of O
pastries B-TARGET
for O
a O
fair O
price. O

The O
pancakes B-TARGET
are O
definitely O
recommended! O

It O
is O
often O
very O
busy. O

We O
were O
already O
there O
last O
year O
when O
we O
were O
in O
Hasselt. O

Now O
we O
have O
returned. O

This O
is O
really O
a O
cool O
thing. B-TARGET

Super O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
the O
delicious O
pancakes O
and O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
really O
good, O
and O
certainly O
not O
expensive. O

Every O
time O
we O
are O
in O

we O
come O
back O
for O
sure!!! O

Nowhere O
in O
Hasselt O
are O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
as O
good O
as O
here!!!! O

Fast O

also O
be O

Swiss B-TARGET
eatery I-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
eat O
delicious O
fondue, B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
fondue O
or O
raclette! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
service B-TARGET
friendly O
and O
the O
surroundings B-TARGET
cozy! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
in O
order. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
overpriced. O

Little O
food B-TARGET
compared O
to O
what O
you O
pay. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
came O
from O
the O
freezer O
and O
had O
little O
taste. O

The O
fish O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
bland O
and O
salty. O

23.90 O
euros O
I O
personally O
think O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
for O
4 O
small O
sole B-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
, O
salty O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
mashed O
potatoes. O

22.80 O
euros O
for O
a O
fish B-TARGET
brochette I-TARGET
with O
2 O
dry O
chunks O
of O
cod B-TARGET
and O
2 O
dry O
chunks O
of O
salmon B-TARGET
I O
also O
find O
rather O
expensive O
and O
simple. O

Simple O
adjustments O
to O
the O
dishes O
would O
already O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
difference. O

I O
like O
to O
spend O
money O
on O
fresh O
food. O

But O
this O
was O
not O
worth O
its O
money. O

It O
could O
be O
better. O

Upon O
our O
arrival O
we O
were O
addressed O
by O
the O
owner B-TARGET
, O
to O
our O
surprise, O
in O
an O
incredibly O
verbal O
manner. O

We O
struggled O
to O
take O
our O
seats. O

Then O
he O
addressed O
us O
again O
excessively O
and O
rudely O
so O
that O
we O
did O
not O
even O
go O
through O
the O
menu. O

We O
left O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
immediately O
never O
to O
return. O

Hopefully O
the O
customers O
will O
not O
all O
be O
treated O
that O
way O
or O
he O
may O
close O
the O
place O
within O
the O
month. O

Too O
bad O
we O
can't O
pass O
judgment O
on O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Just O
returned O
from O
a O
totally O
unsuccessful O
dinner B-TARGET
at O
this O
restaurant. O

All O
previous, O
negative O
comments O
are O
unfortunately O
correct! O

Children O

14h30! O

Bad O
quality O
meat B-TARGET
(pricked O
pseudo O
filetpur O
=>... O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
actually O
a O
glorified O
cafe, O
where O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
staff O
as O
much O
money O
as O
possible O
is O
earned. O

There O
are O
starred O
restaurants O
where O
the O
dining O
is O
cheaper, O
but O
where O
you O
are O
treated O
with O
respect. O

Here O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
thinks O
he O
is O
God O
the O
father. O

Definitely O
not O
recommended, O
there O
is O
better O
for O
much O
less O
money O
to O
find O
in O
Ghent. O

We O
had O
heard O
some O
good O
comments O
about O
this O
restaurant, O
so O
we O
were O
looking O
forward O
to O
a O
pleasant O
evening O
out. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
looks O
nice, O
informal O
with O
the O
wooden O
tables O
and O
chairs, O
the O
(for O
this O
restaurant O
very O
extensive) O
menu B-TARGET
written O
on O
a O
chalkboard O
and O
the O
many O
(empty) O
wine O
bottles O
on O
display. O

There O
is O
an O
impressive O
collection O
of O
grand B-TARGET
crus I-TARGET
from O
Burgundy O
and O
top B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
from O
Bordeaux. O

So O
these O
are O
the O
empty O
bottles, O
not O
one O
of O
which O
is O
on O
the O
menu. O

Perhaps O
the O
chef O
wants O
to O
create O
a O
certain O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
although O
I O
can't O
imagine O
what O
this O
should O
be. O

As O
an O
aperitif, O
I O
ordered O
a O
g&t. O

Where O
as O
a O
rule O
one O
gets O
a O
gin O
menu O
or O
at O
least O
a O
verbal O
listing O
of O
what O
is O
available O
I O
was O
given O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
the O
choice O
between O
"spicy" O
or O
"not O
spicy". O

When O
I O
asked O
to O
see O
a O
list, O
I O
was O
rather O
gruffly O
repeated O
the O
two O
alternatives. O

Anyway, O
not O
everyone O
has O
the O
language O
skills O
to O
describe O
a O
distillate O
in O
elaborate O
terms, O
so O
I O
ended O
up O
getting O
something O
I O
had O
"almost O
chosen O
myself" O
from O
the O
handful O
(idd, O
no O
more) O
of O
available O
gins B-TARGET
in O
the O
chosen O
category. O

The O
apero B-TARGET
was O
well O
prepared, O
including O
my O
wife's, O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about. O

An O
amuse O
might O
not O
have O
been O
bad O
(in O
addition O
to O
the O
5 O
slivers O
of O
raw O
ham), B-TARGET
but O
soit. O

Where O
we O
have O
the O
habit O
of O
ordering O
two O
starters O
for O
our O
youngest O
daughter O
(11j) O
(starter O
and O
main O
course O
is O
too O
much, O
so O
wasteful), O
this O
was O
refused O
without O
a O
word. O

Even O
in O
the O
Parisian O
brasseries O
that O
we O
regularly O
visit, O
this O
is O
never O
a O
problem, O
just O
to O
draw O
an O
analogy. O

From O
this O
point O
on, O
I O
knew O
the O
evening O
was O
not O
going O
to O
be O
what O
we O
had O
imagined. O

Presumably O
this O
is O
a O
form O
of O
"policy", O
but O
not O
a O
form O
of O
management O
that O
is O
still O
the O
case O
in O
most O
restaurants O
today, O
certainly O
not O
in O
an O
establishment O
like O
this. O

So, O
probably O
an O
OK O
restaurant B-TARGET
if O
you O
do O
not O
go O
there O
with O
children, O
and O
you O
do O
not O
mind O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
behaves O
rather O
conceited. O

Pricey O
though, O
which O
brings O
the O
overall O
value O
down O
even O
more. O

Garcon B-TARGET
arrogant O
and O
disgusting, O
can't O
take O
criticism, O
and O
a O
boss B-TARGET
(cook) O
who O
doesn't O
move O
when O
something O
goes O
wrong. O

Received O
bill O
for O
large O
portion O
of O
prawns O
of O
‚Ç¨45 O
while O
we O
had O
ordered O
small!!! O

Prawns B-TARGET
were O
ok O
but O
French O
fries B-TARGET
were O
inedible O
(thick O
limp O
and O
fried O
in O
ou O
fruture O
fat!!!) O

Garcon B-TARGET
, O
take O
a O
course O
in O
basic O
politeness O
and O
customer O
friendliness O
instead O
of O
arrogance O
and O
rudeness, O
but O
this O
will O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
education! O

For O
us O
never O
again O
to O
this O
converted O
cafe O
to O
so-called O
(far O
too O
expensive) O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Have O
been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
and O
always O
the O
same O
impression: O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
price. O

In O
terms O
of O
wine, B-TARGET
they O
only O
have O
the O
more O
expensive O
bottles. O

And O
if O
you O
order O
a O
cheaper O
bottle O
they O
give O
an O
incredibly O
derogatory O
look. O

Sympathetic O
they O
certainly O
are O
not. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
eat O
something O
small O
here, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
slow O
though O
but O
if O
you're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
this O
is O
cozy. O

I O
go O
to O
the O
brooderie O
every O
time O
I O
am O
in O
Ghent. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
flavorful O
and O
fresh. O

Their O
bread B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
served O
as O
a O
side O
dish O
with O
butter. O

The O
soup B-TARGET
of O
the O
day O
, O
vegetarian, O
is O
warm, O
and O
made O
from O
seasonal O
vegetables. O

Their O
spaghetti B-TARGET
bolo I-TARGET
was O
correct, O
well O
seasoned O
and O
served O
with O
cheese. O

Terrace B-TARGET
is O
quite O
pleasant. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
slow, O
but O
friendly. O

Njam! O

Coffee O
with O
pastries. O

You O
can O
choose O
as O
many O
as O
seven O
or O
eight O
different O
kinds O
of O

to O
go O
with O
your O
coffee. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
was O
already O
very O
tasty. O

and O

cared O
for, O
easy O
to O
find O
parking O
at O
the O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
no O
wheelchair O
users O
can O
enter O
as O
it O
is O
on O
the O
first O
floor! O

Ribs B-TARGET
excellently O

hearty O
sauces B-TARGET
. O

A O
suggestion: O
please O
also O
serve O
bread O
(not O
just O
fries O
or O
French O
fries, O
which O
are O
obviously O
also O
delicious) O

On O
Friday O
evening, O
we O
get O
in O
at O
23h05. O

No O
one O
from O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
makes O
the O
effort O
to O
guide O
us O
to O
a O
table, O
because O
of O
too O
busy O
staff O
conversation! O

We O
choose O
a O
seat O
ourselves O
and O
after O
5 O
minutes O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
comes O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
the O
kitchen O
is O
already O
closed. O

Yet O
I O
had O
read O
on O
the O
website O
that O
this O
restaurant O
is O
open O
until O
24h. O

We O
have O
really O
eaten O
very O
well! O

Long O
doubted O
between O
Amadeus, O
crowned O
heads O
and O
this. O

Eventually O
we O
chose O
this O
case B-TARGET
because O
it O
looked O
cozy O
and O
clean. O

We O
have O
not O
regretted O
it. O

First O
we O
ordered O
an O
appetizer O
with O
a O
drink. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
too O
long, O
smooth O
service. B-TARGET

Then O
ribs O
with O
honey, O
these O
did O
not O
take O
long O
either. O

The O
ribs B-TARGET
√† I-TARGET
volont√© I-TARGET
were O
super O
tasty, O
crispy O
and O
not O
burnt. O

These O
were O
accompanied O
by O
greens, O
fries O
and O
sauces. O

Everything O
was O
fine O
and O
for O
a O
good O
price. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O

Is O
not O
Amadeus O
but O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
good O
and O
the O
ribs B-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty O
and O
not O
as O
greasy O
as O
in O
previously O
mentioned O
case. O

We O
have O
been O
here O
several O
times O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
always O
the O
same O
something O
that O
somewhere O
else O
might O
be O
disappointing. O

M.i. O
a O
must, O
still O
for O
the O
chateaubriand B-TARGET
bouqueti√®re: I-TARGET
Usually O
delicious O
meat O
and O
excess O
in O
quantity, O
the O
vegetables O
swim O
in O
the O
butter O
but O
melt O
in O
your O
mouth. O

Very O
occasionally O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
less, O
fortunately O
usually O
top. O

Too O
bad O
that O
the O
wines B-TARGET
have O
recently O
been O
marked O
down O
another O
10-15% O
(a O
modal O
2010 B-TARGET
ch√¢teauneuf I-TARGET
du I-TARGET
pape I-TARGET
now O
costs O
90 O
euros). O

The O
place O
is O
often O
crowded O
and O
rather O
noisy, O
ask O
for O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
guide O
michelins O
(max O
3 O
p.) O
or O
in O
the O
back O
room. O

The O
bar/lounge B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
smoking I-TARGET
annex I-TARGET
is O
cozy O
and O
succeeds O
every O
night O
in O
convincing O
people O
to O
stay. O

No O
top-restaurant B-TARGET
but O
still O
a O
must, O
especially O
for O
the O
traditional O
bon-vivant O
with O
a O
bigger O
appetite. O

We O
continue O
to O
return O
regularly O
with O
pleasure. O

My O
partner O
and O
I O
made O
a O
reservation O
on O
Saturday O
(13/9/2014) O
at O
19h30. O

We O
had O
been O
here O
several O
times O
before O
and O
knew O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
steaks B-TARGET
is O
top O
notch. O

When O
making O
the O
reservation O
we O
had O
asked O
to O
be O
seated O
in O
the O
veranda, O
however O
this O
was O
not O
noted. O

Fortunately O
there O
was O
still O
a O
table O
for O
2 O
people O
available O
in O
the O
veranda O
so O
this O
was O
ok. O

Very O
quickly O
we O
received O
a O
snack O
(slice O
of O
"Gentse O
Kop") O
and O
our O
order O
was O
taken O
by O
a O
friendly O
lady. B-TARGET

We O
also O
ordered O
a O
bottle O
of O
white O
house O
wine O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
water. O

After O
about O
ten O
minutes O
the O
wine O
and O
water O
arrived O
on O
the O
table. O

Not O
much O
later O
our O
appetizer O
was O
also O
served. O

And O
then O
time O
went O
very O
slowly. O

The O
table O
was O
cleared O
and O
the O
wait O
for O
our O
main O
course O
(filet O
pure: O
one O
bleu O
fried, O
the O
other O
saignant) O
could O
begin. O

I O
thought O
we O
were O
still O
pretty O
patient O
because O
only O
after O
1h30 O
of O
waiting O
we O
asked O
if O
we O
would O
get O
our O
food O
the O
same O
evening. O

The O
answer O
was: O
"if O
I O
may O
be O
honest, O
I O
really O
don't O
know". O

Meanwhile, O
our O
bottle O
of O
wine O
was O
already O
empty O
so O
we O
ordered O
a O
second O
bottle. O

Around O
us O
we O
heard O
other O
people O
complaining O
too O
(some O
were O
already O
waiting O
2h30). O

When O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
steak O
at O
21h45 O
(after O
2h15 O
of O
waiting), O
the O
steak B-TARGET
(which O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
fried O
bleu) O
was O
actually O
cold. O

However, O
our O
friendly O
lady B-TARGET
immediately O
intervened O
and O
took O
the O
steak B-TARGET
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
after O
which O
it O
was O
perfectly O
cooked O
and O
served O
hot. O

We O
had O
already O
seen O
the O
chef B-TARGET
welcoming O
customers O
and O
chatting O
all O
evening O
so O
we O
actually O
wanted O
to O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
(long O
wait O
times). O

We O
asked O
our O
waitress O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
chef. O

She O
told O
us O
she O
had O
asked O
him O
but O
apparently O
he O
didn't O
bother O
to O
come O
up O
to O
us O
and O
provide O
any O
explanation. O

Apparently O
you O
have O
to O
be O
at O
least O
BV O
to O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
chef. B-TARGET

Conclusion: O
quality O
was O
top O
but O
manager B-TARGET
does O
not O
lower O
himself O
to O
talk O
to O
ordinary O
customers, O
he O
prefers O
to O
let O
his O
staff O
solve O
the O
problems O
instead O
of O
putting O
his O
own O
house O
in O
order. O

Very O
pathetic O

Tof-Gezellig-Lekker! O

Definitely O
the O
lobster B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
six I-TARGET
different I-TARGET
sauces I-TARGET
once O
order! O

Unique O
setting! O

The O
most O
exquisite O
Sunday B-TARGET
brunch I-TARGET
I O
have O
experienced. O

A O
beautiful O
setting B-TARGET
overlooking O
the O
graslei O
(indeed, O
Coeur O
d'Artichaut O
is O
no O
longer O
located O
in O
Onderbergen, O
but O
on O
the O
Korenlei!). O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
young, O
spontaneous, O
friendly, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
distinguished. O

Everything O
starts O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
exquisite O
Prosecco, B-TARGET
and O
then O
the O
actual O
buffet O
begins: O
soup, O
cold O
starters, O
true O
appetizers, O
a O
special O
chef's O
stew O
(this O
time O
it O
was O
pork O
belly O
with O
trompettes O
de O
la O
mort), O
cheese O
platter, O
sweet O
rolls, O
dessert, O
a O
chocolate O
fountain. O

At O
the O
table, O
meanwhile, O
white O
and O
red O
wine O
was O
poured, O
and O
of O
course O
coffee. O

Absolutely O
recommended! O

Is O
now O

A O
tiny O
authentic O

There O
is O
a O
wide O

of O
pizzas B-TARGET

both O
vegetarian, O
meat O
and O
fish. O

Try O
the O

highly O

Remarkable O
is O
the O
number O
of O
types O
of O
pizzas, B-TARGET
never O
seen O
elsewhere O

The O
only O
place O
in O
Leuven O
with O
really O
real, O
freshly O
made O
sorbets B-TARGET
with O
actual O
fruit O
in O
it O
(and O
no O

Delicious O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
in O
the O
center O
of O
Leuven. O

ladeuzeplein O
offers O
nice O
benches O
where O
you O
can O
enjoy O
this O
delicious O
ice B-TARGET
cream. I-TARGET

The O
scoops B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
are O
generously O
distributed! O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
quite O
small O
for O
a O
brasserie. O

It's O
delicious, O
but O
there O
is O
for O
example O
hardly O
any O
bread O
with O
an O
omelet B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
bacon I-TARGET
. O

2 O
Small O
baked B-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
and O
a O
mini O
omelette B-TARGET
are O
actually O
a O
disappointment. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
tasty O
though. O

As O
it O
is O
a O
leffe O
cafe O
I O
expected O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
beers B-TARGET
, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case. O

There O
was O
mainly O
a O
lot O
of O
hoegaarden. O

In O
summary, O
nice, O
cozy O
but O
not O
top O
notch. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
good O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
friendly. O

If O
it's O
your O
birthday O
you O
get O
a O
free O
glass O
of O
spumante, O
but O
you O
only O
get O
this O
AFTER O
the O
food O
instead O
of O
before O
as O
it O
should O
be O
with O
an O
aperitif. O

We O
regularly O
eat O
at O
the O
Parma, O
one O
of O
the O
classic O
restaurants O
in O
Leuven. O

The O
kitchen O
is O
more O
Belgian-French O
(all O
kinds O
of O
steak O
preparations) O
but O
with O
excellent O
ingredients B-TARGET
(super O
tender O
meat). B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
fast. O

Especially O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
(cote O
√† O
l'os, O
chateaubriand,...) O
carries O
away O
our O
preference. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
trendy, O
but O
solid. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
also O
quite O
classic, O
but O
tasty. O

An O
address O
for O
an O
afternoon O
snack. O

We O
have O
eaten O
out O
several O
times O
at O
Timory O
restaurant. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
classically O
decorated O
and O
that O
exudes O
a O
charm. O

We O
enjoyed O
the O
suggestion O
of O
the O
month O
"filet B-TARGET
pure I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
asparagus"; I-TARGET
classically O
prepared O
with O
respect O
for O
the O
vegetables. O

Moreover, O
we O
particularly O
appreciate O
the O
attentive O
service O
of O
the O
room B-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

An O
address B-TARGET
in O
Leuven O
to O
which O
we O
will O
blindly O
return. O

I O
have O
not O
yet O
eaten O
a O
meal O
at O
the O
Timory, O
but O
I O
have O
tasted O
the O
ice O
cream O
cups O
several O
times. O

My O
favorite O
is O
the O
Emanuelle O
with O
banana, O
banana O
liqueur B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

The O
Na-aper B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vanilla, I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
mousse, I-TARGET
banana I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
advokaat I-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
tasty. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
prompt O
and O
friendly O
and O
there O
is O
often O
a O
pleasant O
crowd. O

Prices O
are O
good. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
at O
the O
Market O
(the O
big O
square), O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
here O
because O
we O
already O
assumed O
that O
the O
quality O
would O
not O
be O
too O
good, O
it O
is O
very O
touristy O
here. O

After O
walking O
for O
a O
while O
through O
the O
streets O
around O
the O
square O
we O
saw O
a O
cozy O
little B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
and O
decided O
to O
go O
inside, O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
back O
entrance. O

The O
prices O
are O
really O
high, O
for O
4 O
thin O
slices O
of O
burned O
baguette B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
garlic I-TARGET
you O
pay O
‚Ç¨ O
5.50, O
and O
to O
our O
great O
disappointment, O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
at O
+ O
/ O
- O
‚Ç¨ O
13.50 O
came O
from O
the O
freezer! O

The O
service B-TARGET
also O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
there O
is O
no O
smile. O

Spend O
your O
money O
elsewhere! O

As O
a O
tourist O
you O
walk O
in O
the O
beautiful O
city O
of O
Bruges O
and O
at O
one O
point O
you O
feel O
like O
good O
food. O

You O
walk O
on O
the O
market O
where O
many O
eateries O
invite O
you O
with O
attractively O
priced O
menus O

You O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
terrace O
and O
order O
something O
from O
the O
menu. O

With O
the O
main O
courses O
appears O
standard O
no O
fries O
or O
vegetables O
to O
sit O
what O
you O
can O
order O
as O
a O
supplement. O

NOTE: O
If O
the O
waiter O
asks O
you O
if O
you O
want O
baguette B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
herb I-TARGET
butter, I-TARGET
this O
costs O
‚Ç¨ O
5.5 O
euros O
for O
a O
plate O
with O
3 O
pathetic O
pieces O
of O
baguette O
per O
person O
so O
not O
even O
a O
basket O
for O
more O
people! O

The O
fries B-TARGET
you O
have O
to O
order O
separately O
cost O
‚Ç¨, O
- O
for O
a O
very O
small O
portion O
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
of O
‚Ç¨3, O
- O
is O
much O
too O
watery. O

Drinks B-TARGET
are O
abnormally O
expensive, O
‚Ç¨6 O
for O
a O
coke O
and O
‚Ç¨9.50 O
for O
a O
Belgian O
beer! O

And O
then O
they O
have O
the O
nerve O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
give O
up O
your O
table O
because O
a O
group O
of O
10 O
people O
need O
your O
table. O

If O
you O
talk O
to O
the O
waiter O
afterwards O
about O
the O
price O
then O
he O
is O
familiar O
with O
this O
but O
it O
is O
due O
to O
the O
location, O
but O
meanwhile O
without O
explanation O
plates B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
baguette I-TARGET
are O
sold O
for O
‚Ç¨ O
5.5 O

This O
entrepreneur B-TARGET
clearly O
has O
no O
desire O
to O
persuade O
customers O
to O
come O
back O
the O
next O
day, O
no O
every O
customer O
they O
can O
get O
a O
leg O
up O
on O
is O
another O
box O
office O
and O
tomorrow O
hundreds O
of O
tourists O
will O
walk O
into O
this O
trap O
again! O

If O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
ruin O
your O
stay O
in O
Bruges, O
do O
not O
eat O
at O
the O
market O
but O
find O
another O
nice O
place O
where O
they O
are O
familiar O
with O
the O
term O
customer O
loyalty O
and O
where O
the O
price-quality O
ratio O
is O
normal! O

VERY O
bad O
wine B-TARGET
is O
sold O
as O
house O
wine O
for O
18.50 O
‚Ç¨ O
/ O
1/2 O
liter O
they O
dare O
not O
show O
the O
empty O
bottle O
because O
there O
is O
large O
scale O
deception O
committed O
with O
brand O
and O
quality O
fries B-TARGET
but O
half O
baked, O
sauce B-TARGET
cold O
and O
the O
same O
on O
each O
dish O
staff B-TARGET
is O
ashamed O
of O
the O
way O
they O
have O
to O
deceive O

VERY O
NOT O
RECOMMENDED O

.. O
outside O
in O
the O
sun O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Eiermarkt I-TARGET
, O
a O
nice O
little O
square O
adjacent O
to O
the O
Market. O

When O
the O
waiter O
handed O
us O
the O
menu, O
we O
asked O
him O
about O
the O
menu O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O
-3 O
courses O
17.50 O
euros-. O

This O
appeared O
to O
refer O
to O
lunch, O
but O
we O
could O
feel O
free O
to O
order O
it O
(it O
was O
past O
six O
in O
the O
evening), O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
just O
a O
bit O
smaller O
according O
to O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
. O

We O
decided O
to O
take O
the O
'adult' O
menu O
of O
29.50 O
anyway. O

If O
we O
were O
in O
a O
hurry? O

No O
we O
weren't, O
we O
were O
sitting O
comfortably, O
nice O
location, B-TARGET
people O
watching, O
beautiful O
weather! O

After O
half O
an O
hour O
my O
fish B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
arrived O
and O
it O
was O
excellent, O
it O
could O
only O
be O
a O
bit O
warmer. O

My O
partner's O
escargots B-TARGET
were O
also O
delicious. O

Then O
the O
mussels, O
for O
me O
in O
white O
wine O
and O
for O
my O
husband O
with O
garlic, O
it O
tasted O
fine, O
mussels B-TARGET
a O
bit O
on O
the O
small O
side. O

Plate O
of O
fries O
to O
go O
with O
it. O

Couple O
of O
scoops O
of O
lemon O
ice O
after. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
friendly. O

The O
bill O
was O
82.50 O
euros, O
including O
a O
Kirr O
(5.-) O
and O
a O
carafe O
of O
white O
wine O
of O
half O
a O
litre O
(18.-). O

Not O
cheap, O
but O
we O
didn't O
expect O
that O
either, O
I O
found O
Bruges O
in O
general O
quite O
pricey, O
not O
only O
Cafe B-TARGET
Belfort I-TARGET
. O

Had O
we O
read O
the O
reviews O
about O
this O
restaurant O
in O
advance O
we O
would O
not O
have O
eaten O
there O
and O
that O
would O
have O
been O
a O
shame! O

Bar O
and O
bar O
bad O
place B-TARGET
. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone! O

I O
am O
sitting O
there O
right O
now O
and O
we O
just O
got O
laughed O
at O
by O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
because O
we O
ordered O
"only O
2 O
teas". O

No O
tip O
and O
we O
will O
never O
come O
here O
again O
! O

Self-righteous O
jerks B-TARGET
! O

The O
food B-TARGET
(3 O
courses) O
were O
brought O
on O
40 O
minutes, O
appetizer B-TARGET
was O
still O
edible, O
but O
the O
water B-TARGET
mess I-TARGET
was O
more O
bone O
than O
chicken O
and O
looked O
horribly O
disgusting, O
the O
stew B-TARGET
was O
incredibly O
dry. O

Really O
not O
recommended... O

Laughable O
display, B-TARGET
someone O
already O
wrote O
about O
this O
that O
it O
is O
just O
like O
Fawlty O
Towers. O

So O
we O
thought O
about O
it O
too. O

We O
had O
taken O
a O
menu O
of O
17 O
euros, O
pat√© B-TARGET
in O
advance O
which O
tasted O
good. O

But O
then O
we O
got O
stew O
with O
fries. O

That O
looked O
like O
a O
child's O
portion, O
5 O
cubes O
of O
meat O
and O
a O
few O
fries. O

Beer B-TARGET
with O
the O
food O
where O
they O
asked O
8 O
euros O
for. O

They O
tried O
to O
sell O
us O
all O
kinds O
of O
things O
during O
the O
meal. O

Glad O
we O
did O
not O
do O
that. O

We O
had O
better O
go O
to O
the O
French O
fry O
shop. O

What O
a O
rare O
ballentent B-TARGET
. O

Walking O
through O
the O
cozy O
Eiermarkt O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
restaurant O
't O
Voutje. O

Looked O
nice O
from O
the O
outside. O

We O
had O
already O
eaten O
a O
little O
elsewhere. O

Therefore O
we O
opted O
for O
a O
limited O
menu O
of O
‚Ç¨ O
17, O
-. O

Was O
not O
bad, O
taste B-TARGET
was O
reasonable O
to O
good. O

But O
apparently O
the O
clientele O
was O
disappointing, O
because O
halfway O
through O
our O
meal O
at O
21.00 O
hours O
the O
empty O
tables O
began O
to O
be O
cleared O
and O
moved O
to O
the O
'night O
mode'. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
grumpy, O
there O
was O
no O
smile O
on. O

In O
short, O
not O
recommended. O

I O
would O
really O
choose O
a O
different O
restaurant O
next O
time, O
there O
are O
really O
enough O
in O
Bruges. O

A O
question O
of: O
Mistake, O
thanks!!!!! O

In O
a O
Fawlty B-TARGET
Towers I-TARGET
scene, I-TARGET
the O
female O
Basyl O
in O
our O
presence O
got O
the O
mantle O
wiped O
off O
by O
the O
female O
John O
Cleese, O
the O
proprietress. O

The O
poor O
wench B-TARGET
had O
accidentally O
served O
us O
our O
neighbors' O
mussels. O

I O
had O
also O
ordered O
mussels, O
so O
I O
had O
started O
eating O
nicely. O

Suddenly O
the O
bowl O
of O
mussels O
was O
snatched O
from O
under O
my O
nose O
by O
the O
female O
John B-TARGET
Cleese. I-TARGET

My O
comment O
that O
I O
had O
already O
eaten O
the O
mussels O
was O
met O
with O
a O
sullen O
sneer O
that O
this O
meal O
would O
be O
deposited O
in O
the O
trash. O

A O
few O
seconds O
later, O
with O
a O
face O
of O
steel, O
she O
came O
deadpan O
to O
serve O
the O
same O
dish O
to O
our O
neighbors. O

Hilarious O
for O
a O
comedy, O
the O
reality O
is O
to O
cry, O
so O
amateurish. O

My O
only O
advice O
is O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
ball B-TARGET
pit. I-TARGET

Accidentally O
ended O
up O
there O
for O
lunch. O

Staff B-TARGET
not O
friendly. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
does O
not O
mention O
non-alcoholic O
drinks. O

If O
you O
ask O
for O
it, O
they O
only O
serve O
water O
per O
0.5l O
(of O
which O
you O
still O
don't O
know O
the O
price). O

We O
took O
chicken O
with O
fries. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
of O
very O
poor O
quality. O

Wine B-TARGET
was O
not O
drinkable. O

What O
a O

Took B-TARGET
menu O
with O
several O
small O
appetizers, O
great O
tasting. O

Then O
fish B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
, O
also O
really O
good. O

Absolutely O
recommended. O

Our O
dinner O
at O
The B-TARGET
Olive I-TARGET

was O
a O
very O
pleasant O
surprise. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
pure O

the O
service B-TARGET
incredibly O
friendly O
and O
attentive. O

We O
can O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
locals O
and O
tourists O
alike. O

Thank O
you O

the O

Very O

manager, B-TARGET
I O
have O
eaten O
delicious O
grilled B-TARGET
squid, I-TARGET
because O
of O
its O
location B-TARGET
rather O
expensive O
and O
mainly O
focused O
on O
tourists, O
but O
still O
not O
a O
bad O
experience! O

Both O
the O

Definitely O
a O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
chose O
the O
three O
course O
daily O
menu. O

We O
also O
got O
so O
many O
amuses, B-TARGET
that O
it O
easily O
could O
have O
been O
a O
four O
course O
menu. O

Everything O
tasted O
perfectly, O
nice O
and O
surprising O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
scanty O
side, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
top. O

The O
service B-TARGET
I O
found O
quite O
informal O
for O
the O
setting. O

No O
problem O
for O
me. O

Each O
dish O
was O
clearly O
explained O
what O
it O
was O
and O
where O
it O
came O
from. O

Not O
quite O
star O
worthy, O

definitely O
recommended! O

This O
is O
a O
restaurant O
for O
special O
occasions. O

You O
are O
spoiled O
from O
the O
first O

to O
the O
various O

Everything O
is O
brought O
very O
original O
and O
the O

Since O
it O
was O
my O

I O
got O
a O
special O

a O

Nicely O

We O

Nice O

in O
short, O
a O
very O
good O

Make O
a O
reservation O
because O
it O
is O
very O
small! O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
a O
limited O
menu O
but O
all O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
copious O
and O
delicious. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
, O
also O
Bruges O
guide, O
makes O
the O
difference. O

What O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
romantic O
dinner B-TARGET
with O
a O
Grouponbon, O
became O
a O
total O
flop. O

We O
have O
never O
eaten O
so O
bad! O

1 O
hour O
waiting O
for O
a O
bruchetta, B-TARGET
which O
was O
a O
dry O
piece O
of O
bread O
with O
some O
flat O
baked O
mushrooms! O

Main O
course O
was O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
frozen I-TARGET
seafood I-TARGET
mix I-TARGET
and O
zero O
comma O
zero O
taste! O

Really O
not O
worthy O
of O
a O
restaurant!!!! B-TARGET

The O
only O
garnish O
was O
some O
unwashed O
parsley B-TARGET
which O
completely O
ruined O
the O
dish. B-TARGET

The O
sand O
is O
still O
crackling O
between O
my O
teeth. O

They O
didn't O
have O
the O
tiramisu, O
so O
just O
ate O
a O
panna O
cotta. O

This O
one O
was O
(from O
a O

tossed O
on O
a O

The O

This O

The O

delicious.....my O

would O
have O
given O
a O
5 O

Top, O
we O
will O
definitely O
go O
back! O

We O
ended O
up O
here O
after O
reading O
the O
reviews O
on O
Tripadvisor! O

Unfortunately O
you O
can O
only O
get O
lunch O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
but O
wanted O
to O
try O
this O
restaurant O
per O
se O
so O
we O
went O
for O
the O
day O
lunch. O

Very O
nice O
salad B-TARGET
with O
nice O
fresh O
salads, O
not O
the O
ones O
you O
often O
get O
served O
straight O
out O
of O
the O
bag! O

Salad O
finished O
with O
a O
nice O
dressing, B-TARGET
fried O
bacon O
and O
good O
feta. B-TARGET

The O
main O
course O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
baked O
salmon O
with O
potatoes O
and O
fresh O
vegetables! B-TARGET

Especially O
the O
latter O
we O
can O
appreciate. O

This O
is O
very O
rare O
and O
really O
enhances O
your O
dish! O

All O
very O
tasty, O
and O
as O
befits O
a O
day O
lunch, O
served O
in O
one O
hour. O

The O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
we O
can O
not O
fail O
to O
mention. O

Something O
to O
go O
back O
and O
try O
one O
of O
their O
menus O
or O
√† O
la O
carte. O

Came O
here O
by O
chance O
in O
search O
of O
a O
restaurant. O

Went O
in O
based O
on O
the O
good O
Tripadvisor O
reviews. O

No O

the O
three B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
Market I-TARGET
Menu I-TARGET
of O
‚Ç¨35 O
was O
delicious. O

We O
have O
eaten O
deliciously O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
of O
‚Ç¨35,- O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
flavors O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
came O
out O
well. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
this O
beautiful O
building O
is O
casual O
and O
pleasant. O

We O
can O
certainly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Bruges. O

Very O
smooth O
service, B-TARGET
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
very O
tasty O
ribs. B-TARGET

Price/quality O
is O
very O
good. O

Only O
downside: O
difficult O
to O
find O
parking O
nearby. B-TARGET

Friendly O
reception B-TARGET
and O
very O
smooth O
service B-TARGET
afterwards. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
(did O
not O
take O
the O
ribs) O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
huge. O

Price/quality O
is O
correct. O

In O
short, O
worth O
repeating. O

it's O
been O
a O
while... O
but O
yesterday O
I O
made O
an O
unexpected O
stop, O
and O
of O
course O
I O
could O
not O
resist O
these O
sweet O
temptations.... O
brownie B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
ginger I-TARGET
was O
superjammie!!!!! O

very O
good O
patisserie B-TARGET
! O

incredible O
eclairs B-TARGET
... O

But O
the O
bread B-TARGET
I O
find O
way O
too O
expensive! O

nice O
that O
you O
can O
look O
inside O
the O
atelier B-TARGET
! O

Breakfast O
between O
the O
books, O
you O
don't O
see O
that O
often. O

Here O
you O
sit O
between O
walls O
full O
of O
books O
in O
a O
cozy O
setting. O

There O
are O
seats O
upstairs O
so O
you O
can O
read O
a O
book O
while O
enjoying O
a O
drink. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
is O
fresh O
and O
tasty. O

You O
can O
choose B-TARGET
between O
different O
formulas. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
friendly. O

I O
came O
here O
for O
lunch O
with O
my O
girlfriend, O
because O
our O
regular O
lunch O
spot O
was O
closed O
due O
to O
annual O
leave. O

Had O
read O
many O
positive O
things O
about O
it, O
but O
wanted O
to O
explain O
our O
experience O
- O
even O
if O
only O
so O
the O
owners O
can O
work O
on O
it. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
have O
lunch O
during O
your O
lunch O
break, O
nobody O
expects O
you O
to O
have O
eaten O
in O
10 O
minutes, O
otherwise O
you O
get O
a O
sandwich. O

But O
in O
this O
case, O
they O
really O
took O
their O
time! O

There O
were O
a O
number O
of O
5 O
tables O
occupied, O
total O
of O
approximately O
12 O
people. O

1 O
table O
of O
4 O
was O
already O
having O
brunch O
when O
we O
arrived, O
so O
that O
still O
makes O
8 O
people O
to O
be O
served. O

A O
woman O
was O
in O
the O
kitchen O
making O
food, O
a O
man O
was O
serving O
the O
room. O

Although O
we O
got O
our O
drinks O
smoothly, O
it O
did O
take O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
man B-TARGET
to O
come O
and O
take O
our O
order O
of O
food. O

Choice B-TARGET
is O
limited, O
bagels, O
special O
croques O
of O
thick O
slices O
of O
bread, O
cheese O
/ O
meat O
plate,... O
In O
the O
end O
both O
me O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
took O
a O
croque. O

Well O
taken O
care O
of, O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
lettuce O
on O
the O
side. O

Croque O
cheese O
and O
ham O
and O
croque O
with O
brie+honey. O

Had O
to O
wait O
25 O
minutes O
for O
this. O

This O
I O
really O
do O
not O
understand. O

Bread, O
fillings O
in O
between O
and O
in O
the O
panini. O

Can't O
take O
that O
long. O

Other O
tables O
were O
served O
equally O
slow. O

I O
understand O
that O
the O
woman O
in O
the O
kitchen O
has O
only O
two O
hands, O
but O
the O
man B-TARGET
was O
behind O
the O
bar O
- O
if O
I'm O
not O
mistaken O
- O
playing O
with O
his O
cell O
phone. O

If O
you O
have O
lunch O
rush-hour O
you O
can O
at O
least O
help O
out O
so O
everyone O
is O
served O
quickly. O

Also O
after O
dinner O
it O
took O
at O
least O
10 O
minutes O
(and O
a O
gesture O
from O
us) O
before O
the O
man B-TARGET
came O
to O
clear O
our O
plates O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
anything. O

Our O
hour O
of O
lunch O
time O
was O
almost O
up O
so O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
bill. O

This O
came O
as O
slowly O
as O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
so O
we O
went O
to O
pay O
at O
the O
bar. O

Apparently O
they O
found O
this O
rather O
rude. O

Unbelievable O
that O
they O
do O
not O
understand O
that O
many O
people O
have O
to O
be O
back O
at O
work O
after O
an O
hour O
lunch O
break O
and O
that O
there O
is O
no O
slack O
in O
this!!! O

Plus O
point: O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
well O
taken O
care O
of. O

(But O
you O
can't O
do O
much O
wrong O
with O
a O
toastie O
either). O

Prices O
are O
also O
really O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
for O
lunch, B-TARGET
if O
I O
pay O
over O
15 O
euros O
for O
lunch O
I O
have O
most O
bistros O
for O
it O
all O
a O
steak O
+ O
fries, O
vol-au-vent, O
or O
a O
well-cared-for O
plate O
of O
pasta. O

For O
1 O
toastie O
and O
1 O
glass O
of O
coke, O
this O
is O
seriously O
excessive!!! O

Conclusion: O
go O
here O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time, O
or O
if O
you O
just O
want O
to O
have O
a O
coffee/tea O
while O
reading O
a O
book. O

Unlike O
many O
catering O
establishments, O
they O
won't O
chase O
you O
away O
here O
for O
staying O
too O
long. O

Again, O
if O
you O
only O
have O
an O
hour O
for O
lunch O
you O
better O
go O
somewhere O
else.... O

It O
was O
a O
pleasant O
stay, O
very O
friendly O
people B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
definitely O
satisfactory, O
a O
quick O
decent O
bite. O

Someone O
who O
loves O
self-made B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
is O
at O
the O
right O
place. O

enjoyed O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
food. B-TARGET

The O
brothers O
bring O
you O
a O
pure, O
refined O
and O
quality O
cuisine B-TARGET
in O
a O
fairytale O
setting B-TARGET
. O

We O
will O
certainly O
come O
back. O

Pomperlut B-TARGET
is O
a O
charming O
restaurant, O
nicely O
decorated O
and O
cosy. O

Not O
much O
choice B-TARGET
but O
enough O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
menu B-TARGET
served. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
cool O
but O
still O
correct. O

Highly O
recommended O
for O
the O
winter O
months O
when O
the O
large O
fireplace O
provides O
nice O
crackling O
heat. O

An O
atmospheric, O
cozy O
setting B-TARGET
. O

Super O
delicious O
food, O
more O
than O
usual. O

Ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
or O
with O
good O
friends. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back, O
but O
maybe O
only O
with O
women, O
because O
Peter, B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
was O
a O
treat O
for O
the O
eye. O

Also O
nice! O

We O
ended O
up O
in O
this O
'little O
house' O
by O
chance, O
where O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
delicious O
piece O
of O
'Limousin' B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
on O
the O
inner O
terrace. O

Super O
nice O
service, B-TARGET
custom O
wines B-TARGET
and O
all O
that O
in O
a O
nice O
and O
quiet O
setting, B-TARGET
away O
from O
the O
crowds O
at O
't O
Zand O
and O
its O
tourist O
traps. O

It O
was O
a O
relief O
for O
us O
to O
get O
away O
from O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
of O
the O
marketplace O
in O
Bruges O
and O
enjoy O
a O
delicious O
meal B-TARGET
in O
a O
very O
quiet O
and O
attractive O
setting. O

Already O
in O
the O
menu B-TARGET
you O
are O
informed O
about O
lactose O
and O
gluten-free O
recipes. O

The O
combination B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
types I-TARGET
was O
special. O

Delicious. O

It O
is O
not O
always O
easy O
for O
vegetarians O
to O
find O
a O
restaurant O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
well O
and O
stylish. O

In O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
it O
works. O

Delicious, O
honest O
and O
distinctive. O

As O
a O
Bruges O
resident, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
highly O
recommended O
and O
one O
that O
I O
would O
recommend O
to O
others. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
and O
very O
fresh. O

The O
chef B-TARGET
shows O
great O
drive O
and O
passion O
for O
his O
craft. O

I O
have O
been O
here O
several O
times O
and O
it O
was O
always O
fine. O

You O
get O
more O
than O
worth O
for O
your O
money! O

Have O
eaten O
here O
several O
times O
and O
each O
time O
smooth O
service B-TARGET
, O
very O
nice O
to O
eat, O
nicely O
presented O
and O
generous O
portions B-TARGET
too. O

Very O
reasonable O
price O
and O
many O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
you O
will O
not O
find O
elsewhere. O

The O
lasagna B-TARGET
is O
super. O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work! O

My O
girlfriend O
and O
I O
had O
a O
great O
meal O
here. O

Not O
the O
ordinary O
everyday O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
something O
different. O

Beautiful, O
modern O
interior B-TARGET
and O
a O
cook B-TARGET
who O
is O
very O
passionate O
about O
food! O

We O
found O
the O
fresh O
lemonade B-TARGET
a O
bit O
bitter O
but O
the O
food, O
in O
our O
case O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
quiche I-TARGET
tasted O
incredibly O
good. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
our O
own O
version O
of O
a O
snicker O
which O
is O
highly O
recommended. O

I O
found O
this O
little O
restaurant O
through O
tripadvisor. O

When O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
and O
saw O
the O
pictures O
I O
definitely O
wanted O
to O
eat O
there. O

When O
you O
step O
inside O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
are O
immersed O
in O
what O
I O
think O
must O
be O
the O
ideal O
world O
according O
to O
these O
two O
nice O
young O
people. O

In O
one O
hour O
you O
relax, O
eat O
fantastic O
food O
and O
see O
two O
people B-TARGET
who O
stand O
behind O
this O
concept O
for O
100%. O

I O
would O
say O
keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
and O
see O
us O
back O
for O
sure. O

We O
have O
eaten O
deliciously O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
fine O
wine. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
was O
great, O
atmosphere B-TARGET
cozy O
and O
pleasant. O

Really O
a O
great O
evening, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back! O

The O
Park B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
is O
definitely O
worth O
a O
visit, O
but O
rather O
to O
assess O
as O
a O
total O
concept: O
very O
friendly O
and O
personal O
welcome, B-TARGET
beautiful, O
cozy O
and O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
warm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
background O
music O
(we O
were O
in O
the O
second O
part O
on O
a O
mezzanine, O
recommended) O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
at O
the O
level O
of O
"good O
civilian O
cuisine" O
, O
do O
not O
expect O
top O
gastronomy. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
generous O
they O
work O
with O
fresh O
ingredients. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
(many O
staff O
present) O
but O
lacks O
some O
experience O
and O
fluency, O
sometimes O
rather O
clumsy. O

There O
is O
perhaps O
1 O
point O
of O
attention: O
the O
bathroom B-TARGET
is O
very O
clean O
and O
spacious, O
but O
there O
is O
only O
1 O
toilet O
for O
women O
and O
1 O
for O
men. O

Yet O
what O
little O
for O
a O
fairly O
large O
restaurant. O

Good O
food B-TARGET
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
attentive O
and O
knows O
what O
they O
are O
talking O
about O
such O
as O
the O
wine O
and O
what O
food O
you O
get O
on O
your O
plate O

The O
personal O
attention O
from O
the O
chef B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice O
I O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
once O
to O
visit O
reservations O
via O
the O
Internet O

We O
had O
dinner O
at O
Park B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
last O
weekend O
to O
celebrate O
my O
boyfriend's O
birthday O
and O
it O
was O
a O
very O
successful O
evening. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
matched O
the O
dishes O
perfectly, O
and O
we O
were O
very O
friendly O
received. O

In O
short: O
a O
must O
for O
a O
weekend O
in O
Bruges! O

Rude O
service B-TARGET
, O
very O
high O
prices, O
51 O
euros O
for O
3 O
coffees, O
3 O
"apple O
cakes" O
and O
2 O
cokes. O

And O
to O
top O
it O
all O
off, O
a O
big O
mouth.....the O
customer O
should O
not O
whine O
but O
had O
to O
give O
a O
tip. O

We O
hope O
that O
something O
can O
be O
done O
about O
this, O
because O
this O
is O
an O
absolute O
low O
point O
in O
such O
a O
beautiful O
city. O

Staff B-TARGET
don't O
look O
at O
you, O
throw O
your O
food O
on O
your O
table O
and O
don't O
even O
bother O
to O
say O
anything O
to O
you. O

If O
you O
ask O
for O
bread B-TARGET
you O
get O
a O
pile O
of O
sandwiches O
from O
a O
plastic O
bag. O

And O
that O
at O
the O
prices; B-TARGET
4 O
Euro O
80 O
for O
a O
beer O
and O
six O
and O
half O
Euro O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
white O
house O
wine. O

Number O
1 O
tourist O
trap. O

Avoid O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

On O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
hotelier O
we O
visited O
this O
restaurant. O

Great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
an O
attractive O
menu. B-TARGET

All O
members O
of O
our O
party O
found O
it O
a O
successful O
evening. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive. O

A O
point O
of O
attention O
for O
me O
is O
the O
use O
of O
spices; O
where O
the O
soup B-TARGET
to O
my O
taste O
had O
a O
too O
pronounced O
pepper O
flavor O
which O
overshadowed O
other O
flavors, O
the O
deer B-TARGET
nuts I-TARGET
were O
rather O
'cowardly' O
seasoned. O

Given O
the O
price O
point, O
I O
think O
perfection O
is O
the O
norm O
and O
that O
level O
was O
just O
not O
achieved O
this O
evening. O

This O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
Bruges O
side O
street O
comes O
highly O
recommended. O

From O
the O
moment O
we O
entered O
I O
felt O
at O
home O
here, O
everything O
was O
right. O

We O
had O
chosen O
the O
suggestion O
menu O
with O
appropriate O
wines. O

Especially O
the O
baby B-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
waterzooi I-TARGET
surprised O
me O
very O
pleasantly. O

I O
can O
only O
concur O
with O
the O
other O
rave O
reviews. O

Dining O
with O
7 O
people O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
retirement. O

Several O
aperitifs, O
the O
monthly O
menu O
with O
custom O
wines, O
dessert, O
coffee+pousse-caf√©. O

A O
windfall! O

This O
restaurant O
located O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Bruges O
in O
the O
Amandstraatje O
has O
existed O
for O
27 O
years O
with O
the O
same O
chef O
and O
his O
lovely O
wife. O

Finally O
a O
classic O
cuisine, B-TARGET
fresh O
and O
tasty O
without O
too O
much O
cinema! O

Price O
quality O
excellent, O
we O
were O
4 O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
monthly O
menu. O

We O
were O
here O
Saturday O
night O
with O
a O
group O
of O
17 O
people O
and O
were O
received O
very O
friendly! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
smooth. O

Even O
with O
such O
a O
large O
group, O
everyone O
was O
just O
allowed O
to O
choose O
from O
the O
menu. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
October O
we O
were O
still O
able O
to O
have O
our O
aperitif O
outside O
on O
the O
terrace O
upstairs O
and O
then O
eat O
inside. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Lots O
of O
choice B-TARGET
and O
everyone O
was O
satisfied O
with O
his/her O
dish. B-TARGET

A O
big O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant! O

Once O
upon O
a O
time... O

Or O
once O
upon O
a O
time... O

Most O
fairy O
tales O
generally O
begin O
like O
this O
and O
yes: O
'Once O
upon O
a O
time O
't O
Zeezotje O
was O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
be O
with O
a O
sympathetic O
patron, O
good O
service O
and O
good O
food O
... O

Unfortunately, O
the O
last O
few O
years O
we O
have O
seen O
this O
increasingly O
fade O
to O
a O
level O
far O
below O
all O
standards: O
customer-unfriendly O
patron, B-TARGET
bad O
food B-TARGET
and O
no O
service B-TARGET
... O

Only O
the O
'kching' O
of O
the O
cash O
register O
counts O
and O
are O
you O
not O
satisfied? O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
door O
... O

Best O
advice? O

Just O
stay O
away, O
because O
there O
are O
much O
better O
and O
more O
sympathetic O
restaurants O
in O
Ostend O
where O
they O
at O
least O
know O
what O
good O
food O
and O
real O
customer O
friendly O
service O
is! O

Well O
... O

We O
came O
several O
times, O
last O
time O
it O
was O
always O
very O
good. O

This O
time O
I O
took O
the O
fish B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
'small I-TARGET
bouillabaise' I-TARGET
which O
in O
my O
opinion O
was O
very O
substandard, O
the O
soup O
did O
not O
taste O
of O
fish, O
there O
was O
a O
large O
piece O
of O
salmon O
in O
it O
(which O
I O
do O
not O
like: O
so O
not O
their O
fault) O
there O
was O
the O
head O
of O
a O
langoust O
in O
it O
(which O
I O
do O
like) O
so O
unfortunately O
only O
the O
head. O

The O
shells O
were O
way O
too O
far O
and O
there O
were O
crabs O
in O
it. O

So O
when O
asked O
was O
it O
tasty: O
no+the O
reason, O
so O
you O
would O
think O
a O
small O
discount O
or O
a O
coffee, O
however O
nothing O
of O
this. O

The O
coffee O
we O
paid O
for O
ourselves O
and O
after O
the O
first O
time O
in O
6 O
years O
no O
drink O
money O
not O
even O
a O
good O
day O
when O
leaving. O

Too O
bad O
hospitality O
and O
then O
complaining. O

And O
say O
that O
we O
already O
recommended O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
friends. O

Thierry O
Laenens O

Meat O
and O
fish B-TARGET
of O
the O
best O
quality, O
kindly O
served O
in O
a O
professional O
manner. O

(Not O
by O
chance O
because O
we O
have O
been O
there O
several O
times!) O

I O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
just O
too O
expensive. O

The O
irish B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
is O
indeed O
made O
at O
the O
table O
by O
the O
boss, O
you O
pay O
10 O
euros O
for O
it O
and O
this O
is O
also O
just O
too O
expensive. O

When O
we O
left O
the O
restaurant O
we O
were O
almost O
obliged O
to O
write O
a O
good O
review. O

Here's O
my O
honest O
opinion. O

Super O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
dog O
friendly! O

We O
even O
got O
our O
meat O
surplus O
to O
take O
home O
in O
a O
handy O
reusable O
microwave O
friendly O
jar. O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work!!!!! O

P.s O
spectacle O
assured O
if O
you O
are O
an O
irish O
coffee O
lover. O

There O
were O
six O
of O
us O
and O
obviously O
expected O
more O
from O
this. O

2 O
of O
us O
had O
ordered O
the O
salmon O
of O
about O
24‚Ç¨ O
with O
fries O
1 O
had O
the O
steak B-TARGET
(less O
than O
125 O
gr) O
23‚Ç¨ O
with O
fries O
1 O
had O
satay O
19‚Ç¨ O
with O
fries O
1 O
scampi O
in O
curry O
with O
bread O
the O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
was O
horrible O
and O
the O
steak B-TARGET
almost O
impossible O
to O
find. O

Luckily O
they O
serve O
it O
on O
a O
plate O
without O
garnish O
which O
was O
separately O
in O
a O
bowl O
on O
the O
plate, O
otherwise O
we O
would O
not O
have O
found O
the O
piece O
of O
fish O
or O
meat. O

1 O
plate O
of O
fries B-TARGET
for O
5 O
adults O
was O
well O
below O
par O
and O
additional O
fries O
came O
after O
our O
plates O
had O
been O
empty O
for O
quite O
some O
time. O

However, O
we O
had O
ordered O
them O
on O
time. O

After O
we O
informed O
the O
patron B-TARGET
of O
our O
dissatisfaction, O
he O
spoke O
to O
us O
arrogantly O
and O
pointed O
out O
that O
these O
are O
the O
normal O
portions O
he O
serves O
his O
customers. O

We O
wonder O
if O
the O
children's O
portions O
are O
the O
same O
size O
as O
ours. O

(Children O
then O
have O
their O
bellies O
full O
eaten O
adults O
certainly O
not) O

You O
be O
warned! O

With O
a O
groupon O
to O
eat O
in O
this O
case. O

Already O
eaten O
badly, O
tastes O
may O
nl O
differ, O
but O
there O
are O
sick O
of O
that O
is O
really O
not O
normal O
to O
call. O

Starters: O
'Lightly B-TARGET
fried I-TARGET
tuna' I-TARGET
was O
well O
done. O

Scampi B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
garlic' I-TARGET
was O
not O
exaggerated, O
they O
were O
swimming O
in O
butter, O
unbelievable O
amount O
of O
garlic. O

I O
taste O
it O
the O
day O
after, O
and O
everything O
has O
come O
out O
hours O
back. O

Main O
courses O
Baked O
ribs O
with O
3 O
sauces, O
rib B-TARGET
had O
been O
reheated O
exactly O
once, O
the O
taste O
was O
a O
bit O
strange, O
but O
I O
thought O
of O
a O
strange O
marinade. O

The O
sauces B-TARGET
(homemade?) O
had O
exactly O
multiple O
colors O
(to O
be O
clear, O
the O
same O
sauce O
had O
different O
colors O
after O
stirring O
in O
it). O

Also, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
fat O
hanging O
off O
the O
ribs B-TARGET
. O

My O
friend's O
steak O
with O
bearnaise O
sauce O
was O
ordered O
saignant O
but O
delivered O
bien O
cuit, O
after O
making O
this O
clear O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
replied O
, O
oh O
I O
said O
bc O
but O
I O
actually O
didn't O
know, O
will O
be O
saignant, O
the O
steak O
was O
just O
not O
black O
... O

The O
fries B-TARGET
... O
well O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
same O
mood O
as O
other O
comments, O
even O
these O
in O
the O
MacDonalds O
are O
better. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
that O
came O
with O
it O
was O
ok. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
still O
the O
best, O
but O
we O
were O
lucky O
apparently. O

The O
same O
tiramisu B-TARGET
at O
the O
neighbors O
was O
rock O
hard O
and O
only O
warm O
on O
the O
bottom, O
sounds O
like O
microwaving O
to O
me. O

Mine O
did O
not O
have O
this, O
but O
I O
had O
ordered O
the O
dessert O
in O
advance, O
the O
neighbors O
after O
their O
main O
course. O

My O
friend O
had O
apple B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
, O
which O
she O
thought O
was O
ok. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
... O
let's O
just O
say O
I've O
had O
better O
ones O
for O
much O
less O
than O
22 O
euros. O

Immediately O
after O
dessert O
we O
left O
without O
words, O
given O
other O
comments O
a O
good O
decision. O

After O
10 O
minutes O
we O
are O
home, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
already O
feels O
it O
coming, O
straight O
to O
the O
toilet. O

Myself O
the O
whole O
evening O
and O
night O
uncomfortable, O
feeling O
like O
I O
have O
to O
vomit O
but O
it O
doesn't O
come. O

In O
the O
morning O
I O
get O
up O
and O
everything O
is O
out O
again. O

This O
place B-TARGET
should O
be O
closed, O
as O
I O
am O
clearly O
not O
the O
only O
one O
who O
has O
had O
a O
bad O
experience O
here. O

The O
seafront O
already O
doesn't O
always O
have O
a O
good O
reputation, O
well O
cases O
like O
this O
certainly O
don't O
do O
it O
any O
favors. O

Yesterday O
me O
and O
my O
friend O
thought O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
dinner O
with O
the O
good O
weather. O

He O
ordered O
a O
pasta O
carbonara, O
I O
a O
pancake O
with O
sugar. O

When O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
food O
at O
the O
table O
after O
half O
an O
hour, O
we O
each O
took O
1 O
bite O
of O
our O
dish B-TARGET
only O
to O
realize O
that O
it O
was O
inedible! O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
carbonara I-TARGET
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
hard O
layer O
of O
cold O
cheese, O
cream O
and O
soggy O
spaghetti, O
and O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
were O
made O
in O
a O
pan O
that O
they O
had O
not O
washed O
for O
days. O

Just O
awful! O

The O
waiter O
(a O
job O
student) O
went O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
with O
our O
plates O
but O
we O
just O
got O
them O
back, O
and O
the O
chef B-TARGET
said O
that O
both O
these O
dishes O
were O
normal O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
them. O

Since O
my O
friend O
had O
barely O
taken O
2 O
bites O
of O
his O
pasta, O
he O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it, O
then O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
acted O
very O
frank O
and O
forced O
us O
to O
pay!!!!!!! O

We O
will O
never O
come O
back O
here O
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone. O

Even O
free O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
and O
ruins O
your O
day O
and O
mood. O

If O
I O
could O
I O
would O
put O
up O
a O
sign O
at O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
itself O
advising O
against O
it O
to O
all O
visitors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

Fine O
and O
cozy O
family O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

Classy O
meals B-TARGET
and O
positive O
value O
for O
money. O

Coming O
out O
with O
a O
satisfied O
and O
happy O
feeling. O

Great O
people B-TARGET
with O
a O
nice, O
friendly O
and O
caring O
atmosphere. O

More O
than O
worth O
repeating, O
recommended. O

Fine O
and O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
classy O
meals. B-TARGET

For O
me O
certainly O
the O
best O
and O
nicest O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Ostend. O

I O
will O
regularly O
jump O
in O
here O
and O
not O
only O
for O
the O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
but O
also O
for O
the O
hospitality. O

First, O
we O
were O
very O
nicely O
received O
by O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

Then O
came O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
that O
was O
perfect! O

Best O
lamb B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
in O
ages. O

The O
couscous B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
well O
prepared. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back. O

Everything O
tip O
top O
in O
order O
... O
food B-TARGET
super O
good... O
very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
so O
much O
more O
... O
very O
nice O
also O
for O
family O
occasions O
... O
little O
money O
and O
a O
lot O
to O
eat O
... O

Cozy O
renovated O
terrace B-TARGET
, O
but O
because O
it O
was O
chilly O
we O
went O
inside O
to O
eat O
anyway. O

Very O
outdated O
restaurant, B-TARGET
dusty O
curtains, O
benches O
and O
chairs O
seriously O
damaged, O
mussels O
nature O
ordered. O

3 O
hairs O
(of O
the O
cook) O
against O
it. O

Keteltje B-TARGET
rusted O
and O
well O
damaged. O

Flat O
fries B-TARGET
added O
, O
sour O
and O
runny O
mayo B-TARGET
. O

Friend O
had O
vol B-TARGET
au I-TARGET
vent I-TARGET
, O
but O
that O
looked O
like O
it O
was O
already O
eaten O
.... O

They O
don't O
see O
me O
there O
anymore, O
way O
too O
expensive O
for O
such O
poor O
quality! O

I O
am O
not O
often O
critical O
of O
my O
food. O

If O
it O
is O
good O
it O
is O
good. O

But O
this O
was O
anything O
but O
good. O

Very O
unfriendly O
staff B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
poor. O

Price-quality O
ratio O
is O
clearly O
not O
right O
here. O

Not O
recommended. O

Without O
your O
money. O

This O
is O
definitely O
not O
recommended, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
bland O

If O
you O
like O
to O
eat O
well O
this O
is O
certainly O
not O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
you O
should O
take, O
there O
are O
many O
better O
in O
Ostend, O
too O
bad O
because O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
... O
on O
the O
market O

Have O
been O
there O
several O
times O
with O
groupon O
to O
eat. O

Imagine O
no O
top O
restaurant, O
but O
... O
We O
were O
kindly O
received, O
received O
a O
proper O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
food B-TARGET
. O

have O
gone O
to O
eat O
there O
on O
Sunday O
evening, O
November O
02 O
with O
voucher O
of O
groupon, O
had O
a O
wide O
choice O
of O
menus, B-TARGET
got O
a O
nice O
table B-TARGET
at O
the O
window O
with O
candlelight, O
good O
and O
fast O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
good, O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about. O

where O
then O
these O
bad O
reviews???? O

Of O
course O
there O
is O
a O
large O
terrace O
at O
the O
institution O
and O
in O
the O
summer O
with O
nice O
weather O
it O
is O
sometimes O
overcrowded, O
but O
we O
know O
that O
when O
we O
come O
to O
the O
sea O
with O
nice O
weather O
that O
one O
asks O
for O
problems, O
which O
generally O
begin O
on O
the O
highway, O
no O
parking, O
etc O
etc O
etc O

We O
sat O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
full O
autumn O
sun, O
lovely O
place! O

Unfortunately O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
more O
than O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
could O
order. O

Menu B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
unclear O
(French O
and O
Dutch O
mixed). O

Reasonably O
tasty O
soup B-TARGET
and O
shrimp B-TARGET
croquettes. I-TARGET

But O
the O
lady B-TARGET
from O
the O
service O
called O
two O
other O
guests O
out O
for O
a O
disagreement O
on O
the O
receipt. O

A O
little O
later O
my O
friend O
was O
also O
chased O
away O
because O
she O
took O
the O
wrong O
door O
to O
the O
toilet. O

NEVER O
AGAIN! O

Reading O
the O
most O
recent O
reviews, O
after O
my O
visit O
on O
Saturday O
night O
25/10, O
I O
can O
only O
agree O
that O
a O
bit O
of O
basic O
"class" O
is O
way O
out O
there. O

Indeed, O
long O
waits, O
drinks B-TARGET
not O
chilled, O
rude, O
no, O
rude O
service B-TARGET
, O
burnt O
food B-TARGET
and O
then O
if O
you O
as O
a O
customer O
make O
a O
careful O
comment, O
you O
have O
to O
(dixit) O
"stop O
whining"... O

It O
is O
my O
personal O
impression O
that O
this O
place B-TARGET
runs O
on O
(day-) O
tourists O
or O
customers O
who O
come O
here O
once O
and O
then O
never O
again. O

In O
any O
case, O
they O
will O
NEVER O
see O
me O
here O
again! O

Madam, O
sir, O
I O
have O
always O
remained O
polite O
and O
correct, O
and O
I O
promised O
you, O
after O
the O
police O
visit O
where O
I O
of O
course O
drew O
the O
short O
straw, O
that O
I O
was O
not O
going O
to O
stop O
there. O

You O
can O
consider O
this O
as O
step O
one. O

This O
is O
a O
promise. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
quick O
bite O
in O
Ostend O
there O
are O
dozens O
of O
other O
addresses O
than O
McDonalds B-TARGET
!!!! O

If O
necessary, O
go O
to O
the O
quays O
to O
get O
some O
fish O
snacks O
or O
a O
sandwich O
at O
the O
local O
butcher O
shops O
or O
the O
Panos! O

Very O
dirty, O
hardly O
any O
tables O
cleared. O

Going O
to O
the O
toilet B-TARGET
(well, O
kids O
can't O
wait) O
is O
hell! O

Hot, O
dirty O
floors, O
smelly, O
long O
queue B-TARGET
... O

I'm O
not O
speaking O
out O
about O
McDonalds O
in O
general, O
but O
I O
think O
it's O
a O
crime O
if O
you O
go O
to O
the O
McDo B-TARGET
in O
Ostend!!!! O

It's O
never O
really O
clean O
and O
the O
floor B-TARGET
is O
always O
very O
sticky. O

Also O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
often O
cold O
or O
the O
machines B-TARGET
are O
broken, O
for O
example O
the O
mc O
flurry. O

But O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly. O

Aperitif O
ordered O
-2 O
times O
rye O
and O
half O
liter O
of O
house O
wine. O

Aperitif O
OK O
-about O
7' O
later O
came O
the O
appetizers O
... O
OK O
can O
happen. O

Afterwards O
came O
the O
rye B-TARGET
: O
so O
dried O
out O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
it O
off O
the O
bone. O

-This O
was O
really O
not O
edible. O

When O
I O
made O
the O
comment O
I O
was O
answered O
that O
the O
other O
side O
was O
less O
dry. O

So O
immediately O
asked O
for O
the O
bill. O

Only O
positive O
point: O
the O
rye O
was O
not O
charged O
out O
of O
honest O
embarrassment? O

A O
dinner B-TARGET
that O
will O
be O
remembered O
:( O

When O
entering O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
I O
was O
already O
surprised O
to O
see O
that O
there O
was O
carpet O
all O
over O
the O
place. O

After O
a O
while O
we O
received O
the O
menu B-TARGET
...... O
This O
was O
no O
more O
than O
a O
scrapbook, O
literally O
and O
figuratively. O

Prices O
adjusted O
with O
a O
sticker O
and O
the O
card B-TARGET
sticks O
to O
your O
hands. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
a O
horrible O
ring O
binder O
that O
was O
totally O
crumpled O
and O
stuck O
to O
your O
hands. O

Here O
we O
wisely O
did O
not O
look O
further. O

In O
the O
end O
we O
opted O
for O
the O
filet O
pure. O

Was O
clearly O
2nd O
grade O
meat B-TARGET
and O
was O
barely O
warm, O
sauces B-TARGET
are O
available O
in O
jars O
from O
the O
fryer. O

The O
guys B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
service I-TARGET
try O
their O
best, O
but O
unfortunately O
they O
can O
not O
save O
the O
suspected O
calf. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
favorite O
of O
crawling O
and O
flying O
insects O
you O
will O
come O
around. O

Flies O
come O
to O
eat O
with O
you, O
squashed O
backs O
against O
the O
windows O
and O
Sebastian O
the O
spider O
in O
his O
huge O
web O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
back O
window.... O
well O
all O
inside O
to O
be O
admired. O

Positive O
distress O
for O
dog O
lovers, O
doggies O
are O
allowed O
in O

Suspicion-Antwerp.city O

We O
had O
to O
decide O
between O
a O
restaurant O
a O
bit O
further O
down O
the O
road O
where O
you O
could O
eat O
mussels O
in O
white O
wine O
sauce O
with O
cream O
and O
garlic O
for O
just O
over O
20 O
euros O
or O
La O
Sirene, O
where O
they O
offered O
mussels O
au O
naturel O
for O
13 O
euros. O

7 O
euros O
is O
a O
very O
big O
difference, O
so O
I O
chose O
La O
Sirene. O

I O
have O
no O
regrets. O

The O
mussels B-TARGET
were O
delicious O
and O
for O
13 O
euros O
you O
get O
them O
almost O
nowhere. O

French O
fries B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mayonnaise I-TARGET
were O
included O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
friendly. O

We O
made O
a O
reservation O
in O
time O
for O
a O
group O
of O
30 O
people. O

But O
when O
we O
arrived O
there O
on O
the O
spot, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
closed, O
on O
vacation. O

Apparently O
no O
one O
had O
thought O
to O
notify O
us O
of O
this. O

Apparently O
there O
was O
not O
even O
a O
simple O
"allo O
allo" O
of O
it. O

Pleasant O
is O
different O
... O

The O
offer O
of O
beers B-TARGET
and O
other O
is O
very O
limited O

The O
prices O
are O
high O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
slow. O

It O
could O
clearly O
be O
better. O

Do O
you O
want O
good O
and O
cheap O
food? O

Daily O
specials O
at O
noon O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
a O
choice O
of O
4 O
or O
5 O
starters O
and O
main O
courses? O

Then O
you're O
best O
at O
Allo O
Allo. O

On O
the O
market O
square O
in O
Kortrijk, O
with O
a O
nice O
terrace. B-TARGET

A O
nice O
place B-TARGET
on O
a O
beautiful O
square O
in O
Kortrijk. O

Beautiful O
setting. B-TARGET

We O
took O
the O
menu O
at O
36 O
euros O
with O
appetizers, O
sashimi O
of O
tuna, O
venison O
with O
forest O
mushrooms O
and O
coffee O
with O
some O
mignardises. O

Everything O
very O
correct O
and O
tasty. O

Very O
nice O
for O
this O
price. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
. O

Quality O
of O
wines B-TARGET
served O
by O
the O
glass O
could O
be O
better. O

Evening O
meal O
with O
2 O
friends. O

We O
were O
well O
received O
and O
immediately O
escorted O
to O
the O
table. O

Very O
pleasant O
interior. B-TARGET

On O
the O
chalkboard O
there O
were O
wine B-TARGET
suggestions I-TARGET
at O
an O
attractive O
price. O

We O
chose O
the O
tartare B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
king I-TARGET
crab, I-TARGET
very O
nice O
and O
freshly O
prepared. O

The O
fish O
soup O
and O
the O
homemade B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
are O
really O
authentic O
preparation. O

Then O
a O
filet B-TARGET
pur I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pepper I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
perfectly O
cooked. O

And O
the O
risotto O
with O
fish. O

Very O
well O
cooked O
risotto. B-TARGET

To O
end O
the O
evening O
an O
Irish O
coffee. O

Definitely O
a O
must O
both O
interior, B-TARGET
service, B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

See O
you O
again O
. O

What O
a O
disappointment. O

It O
all O
looks O
nice O
and O
promising O
but O
food B-TARGET
is O
a O
disaster. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
far O
from O
cordial, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
month I-TARGET
inadvisable. O

The O
starter B-TARGET
is O
full; O
flower O
sauce O
and O
the O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
a O
mess. O

The O
custom B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
with O
the O
menu O
are O
poor, O
the O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
not O
chilled, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
unfeeling O
and O
impersonal. O

What O
a O
waste O
of O
money. O

Never O
again. O

Together O
with O
my O
daughter, O
I O
went O
to O
enjoy O
an O
evening O
at O
St B-TARGET
Christophe I-TARGET
restaurant O
; O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
for O
both! O

The O
processing O
of O
Banyuls O
with O
the O
appetizer O
was O
already O
a O
memory O
of O
many O
vacations O
... O

The O
crayfish B-TARGET
also O
met O
with O
our O
approval. O

A O
big O
bravo O
for O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

And O
the O
mango B-TARGET
tango I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
was O
a O
perfect O
ending O
to O
the O
dinner! O

Expert O
information O
about O
the O
wines O
was O
very O
kindly O
given O
to O
us O
and O
the O
hospitality O
of O
the O
lady B-TARGET
is O
heartwarming! O

We O
will O
definitely O
be O
back! O

Few O
people O
on O
a O
summer O
Friday O
evening. O

It O
was O
dining O
in O
the O
garden O
of O
this O
beautiful O
mansion B-TARGET
. O

Although O
very O
cozy, O
the O
garden B-TARGET
needs O
some O
maintenance. O

Few O
people, O
so O
few O
staff. O

Must O
be O
possible O
with O
three O
tables O
and O
yet O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
not O
really O
smooth. O

Starter, O
half B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
lobster, I-TARGET
was O
fine. O

Main O
course, O
the O
steak, B-TARGET
very O
good. O

Dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
nobody. O

In O
the O
end, O
with O
all O
the O
trimmings, O
still O
pricey. O

A O
lady O
and O
a O
gentleman O
took O
care O
of O
the O
service. O

The O
lady B-TARGET
did O
a O
fine O
job, O
the O
gentleman B-TARGET
rather O
forced. O

Took O
a O
lunch O
menu, O
it O
was O
Friday O
afternoon. O

Price/quality O
pretty O
good. O

But O
it O
took O
quite O
a O
long O
time... O

From O
12:15 O
to O
15:15, O
so O
three O
hours, O
is O
disproportionate O
for O
a O
lunch O
menu O
in O
my O
opinion. O

Good O
that O
we O
went O
there O
once, O
but O
that's O
about O
it. O

Gastronomically O
delicious O
food O
in O
beautiful O
old O
mansion B-TARGET
. O

Beautifully O
laid O
tables. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
at O
a O
high O
level. O

Choice B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
price-quality O
very O
good. O

Highly O
recommended. O

We O
ate O
lunch O
for O
19 O
EUR. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

The O
plaice B-TARGET
that O
followed O
was O
very O
poor: O
small O
and O
fried O
a O
bit O
too O
hard O
and O
for O
both O
of O
us O
we O
got O
a O
very O
poor O
portion O
of O
fries. B-TARGET

Asking O
for O
more O
was O
only O
possible O
after O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
had O
passed O
by O
10 O
times O
without O
looking O
up O
so O
we O
finally O
got O
them O
when O
the O
rest O
of O
our O
plate O
was O
already O
empty. O

For O
dessert O
we O
had O
a O
Dame B-TARGET
Blanche: I-TARGET
a O
scoop O
of O
half-melted O
ice O
cream O
with O
chocolate O
sauce O
and O
a O
generous O
portion O
of O
cr√®me B-TARGET
fraiche I-TARGET
from O
a O
spray O
can, O
served O
in O
a O
glass. O

A O
dessert B-TARGET
of O
a O
lunch O
doesn't O
have O
to O
be O
big, O
but O
a O
nicer O
serving O
and O
preferably O
not O
in O
a O
glass O
would O
help O
a O
lot. O

We O
come O
here O
very O
regularly O
and O
do O
not O
understand O
all O
the O
negative O
comments! O

But O
yes O
that O
is O
the O
time O
we O
live O
in, O
people O
have O
0 O
patience O
and O
are O
easily O
rude.... O
Think O
a O
waiter O
is O
their O
slave O
who O
just O
has O
to O
jump O
when O
they O
snap O
their O
fingers! O

Pathetic O
people O
I O
call O
this. O

Would O
like O
to O
see O
them O
do O
it O
themselves O
one O
day. O

At O
New B-TARGET
Havana I-TARGET
in O
Knokke, O
you O
can O
eat O
well, O
yes O
prices O
are O
a O
bit O
higher O
but O
euh O
.... O
That O
goes O
for O
pretty O
much O
all O
of O
Knokke. O

So O
if O
you O
do O
not O
have O
that O
for O
you O
should O
not O
be O
in O
Knokke. O

We O
are O
always O
well O
served, O
and O
enjoy O
a O
drink B-TARGET
or O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Also O
the O
nonsense O
in O
the O
P O
magazine O
we O
do O
not O
understand. O

Let O
alone O
the O
nonsense O
of O
"chef O
Bellings" O
ahem O
.... O

Top O
chef O
caught O
on O
doping. O

What O
a O
reference. O

People O
go O
and O
see O
for O
yourself. O

One O
can O
never O
do O
good O
for O
everyone. O

We O
can O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
since. O

We O
go O
there O
every O
time O
we O
are O
at O
sea! O

But O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
before O
they O
come! O

Pancakes B-TARGET
are O
delicious! O

But O
the O
chocolate B-TARGET
milk I-TARGET
is O
not O
homemade! O

For O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
there, O
I O
think O
you O
should O
get O
a O
homemade O
one! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
okay! O
(can O
be O
seen O
with O
who!) O

Good O
but O
not O
brilliant! O

It O
rains O
inside O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
! O

This O
is O
the O
dirtiest, O
worst O
restaurant B-TARGET
ever O
visited O
and O
we O
visit O
many O
a O
year. O

They O
took O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
out O
of O
the O
adams O
family. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
spoiled. O

Close O
that O

Also O
this O
year O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
fireworks O
festival O
we O
went O
to O
Wim's O
for O
dinner. O

We O
knew O
that O
we O
had O
to O
make O
reservations O
during O
the O
weekend, O
and O
our O
table O
with O
sea O
view O
('t O
is O
to O
say O
on O
the O
3 O
rows O
of O
beach O
cabins) O
was O
waiting O
for O
us O
covered. O

Those O
who O
didn't O
have O
to O
make O
a O
reservation O
didn't O
get O
in. O

And O
we O
enjoyed O
again O
the O
delights O
that O
the O
sea O
had O
to O
offer. O

This O
is O
and O
remains O
for O
years O
one O
of O
the O
better O
addresses O
on O
the O
seafront O
in O
Knokke-Heist. O

And O
if O
we O
are O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
again O
next O
year O
or O
earlier O
we O
like O
to O
come O
back. O

Very O
good O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
sea O
view. O

We O
were O
well O
received O
by O
the O
proprietress B-TARGET
who O
is O
clearly O
better O
surrounded O
than O
before. O

The O
choice B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
of O
excellent O
quality. O

We O
took O
the O
grilled O
mussels O
with O
herb O
butter O
and O
the O
smoked O
salmon O
as O
starters. O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
a O
generous O
portion O
of O
cod B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
young I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mousseline I-TARGET
. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
could O
be O
finished O
a O
little O
better, O
but O
that's O
a O
detail. O

Great O
family B-TARGET
affair I-TARGET
on O
the O
coast. O

Always O
delicious. O

We O
have O
become O
regular O
customers. O

Everything O
is O
super O
fresh O
and O
superbly O
prepared. O

Choice O
of O
several O
starters, B-TARGET
main I-TARGET
courses O
and O
desserts O
for O
a O
fair O
price. O

Attentive O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
nice O
setting. B-TARGET

In O
other O
words, O
a O
real O
winner! O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Have O
taken O
menu O
with O
wine O
included, O
choice O
of O
5 O
starters O
and O
5 O
main O
courses. O

Very O
tasty O
and O
this O
for O
a O
normal O
price! O

2 O
lunch B-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
with O
wide O
choice O
of O
starters O
and O
main O
courses O
at O
correct O
price O
. O

Moreover, O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

Came O
here O
before O
and O
always O
come O
back O
with O
pleasure. O

Advance O
booking O
recommended. O

A O
windless O
and O
very O
hot O
day O
in O
September. O

A O
couple O
of O
poor O
people O
do O
the O
service. B-TARGET

As O
former O
restaurateurs, O
our O
hearts O
ache O
when O
we O
see O
how O
much O
money O
is O
left O
on O
the O
street/in O
the O
pockets O
of O
customers. O

Running O
away O
customers O
who O
have O
to O
wait O
to O
give O
their O
order O
is O
rule O
1, O
deserted O
tables O
that O
are O
not O
cleared O
is O
rule O
2 O
and O
the O
biggest O
sin O
in O
the O
hospitality O
industry O
is O
walking O
back O
and O
forth O
empty O
handed O
is O
rule O
3. O

This O
makes O
it O
a O
long O
wait O
before O
you O
can O
order, O
a O
long O
wait O
until O
you O
are O
served O
and O
ordering O
a O
meal O
after O
your O
drink O
is O
almost O
an O
impossible O
task. O

But O
we O
managed! O

We O
got O
moderate O
food B-TARGET
at O
Knokke O
prices, O
which O
were O
even O
higher O
because O
the O
casino O
is O
next O
door. O

Afterwards O
to O
the O
toilet B-TARGET
, O
which O
is O
not O
recommended. O

The O
rancid O
sewer O
smell O
hits O
you O
on O
the O
throat O
and O
almost O
makes O
you O
puke. O

No, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
will O
not O
last O
long. O

We O
have O
known O
the O
Lodge O
for O
several O
years O
and O
often O
visit O
them O
(Diest, O
Aarschot, O
Zolder O
and O
Knokke). O

This O
time, O
both O
the O
food, B-TARGET
service B-TARGET
and O
restaurant B-TARGET
were O
substandard!!!! O

We O
had O
shrimp B-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
where O
you O
had O
to O
look O
for O
the O
shrimp. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
that O
was O
served O
with O
them O
was O
also O
not O
fresh O
anymore O
and O
thrown O
on O
top, O
fried B-TARGET
parsley I-TARGET
was O
also O
of O
mediocre O
level! O

The O
butter B-TARGET
served O
with O
our O
sole O
was O
full O
of O
burnt O
bits O
:-(. O

We O
sat O
outside O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
which O
was O
ok O
(no O
table O
cloths O
though O
we O
had O
made O
reservations). O

When O
going O
to O
the O
toilet, O
the O
smell O
came O
against O
you, O
seemed O
like O
days O
since O
there O
was O
not O
cleaned! O

Also O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
the O
packages O
of O
butter O
and O
bread O
were O
on O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
service O
table. O
(It O
could O
be O
that O
it O
was O
busy O
but O
picking O
it O
up O
takes O
no O
time O
at O
all). O

There O
were O
3 O
valets B-TARGET
present O
and O
it O
was O
certainly O
not O
busy, O
they O
had O
time O
to O
talk O
to O
each O
other O
so O
one O
could O
easily O
have O
cleaned O
up O
a O
little O
"mess"! O

In O
addition, O
one O
of O
the O
valet B-TARGET
did O
not O
speak O
a O
word O
of O
Dutch O
or O
French!? O

This O
is O
NOT O
the O
service B-TARGET
we O
know O
from O
the O
other O
Lodge O
it O
was O
really O
substandard!!!! O

Fireworks O
festival O
-few O
restaurants, O
so O
first O
take O
where O
there O
is O
room. O

When O
we O
asked O
if O
there O
was O
room, O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
wanted O
to O
help O
us, O
but O
was O
brutally O
pulled O
away O
by O
another O
waiter O
and O
left O
us O
standing. O

We O
then O
sat O
down O
ourselves O
and O
were O
"helped" O
by O
a O
rude O
(old O
man B-TARGET
with O
gray O
hair) O
(= O
I'll O
come O
back O
when O
I O
have O
time). O

After O
finally O
ordering, O
we O
saw O
waiters B-TARGET
fumbling O
(looking O
for O
the O
right O
tables), O
the O
old O
gray-haired O
man O
was O
insulting O
everyone,..... O

We O
saw O
at O
least O
16 O
tables O
walk O
away O
because O
they O
were O
not O
served. O

After O
dinner O
we O
asked O
for O
another O
coffee O
from O
the O
old O
man B-TARGET
and O
his O
answer O
was, O
'no!!!, O
I'm O
going O
to O
clear O
all O
the O
tables O
(a O
lot) O
first O
and O
only O
then O
I'll O
come O
back. O

We O
replied O
back O
to O
this O
and O
said O
it O
extra O
loud O
what O
we O
thought O
of O
the O
service. O

Then O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
back: O
'I O
want O
to O
apologize O
with O
2 O
free O
coffees O
(we O
had O
ordered O
3), O
but O
if O
you O
do O
not O
like O
it O
you O
should O
put O
an O
apron O
on O
yourself O
"SPECIAL O
EXCUSE!!!! O

At O
that O
moment O
all O
the O
tables O
around O
us, O
who O
were O
not O
served, O
got O
up O
and O
said O
he O
had O
to O
find O
another O
job. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
due O
to O
the O
clumsiness O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
(searching O
for O
minutes O
to O
find O
the O
right O
table), O
the O
sauce O
was O
cold!!!! O

I O
will O
never O
come O
back O
here O
and O
I O
hope O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
(old O
man O
with O
grey O
hair) O
will O
be O
fired. O

Because O
how O
he O
reacted O
to O
the O
customers O
was O
outrageous! O

Especially O
for O
that O
price. O

If O
there O
were O
other O
restaurants O
free, O
we O
would O
have O
left O
immediately. O

But O
yes, O
you O
have O
to O
eat.... O

This O
restaurant O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
list O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Ypres. O

However, O
I O
cannot O
imagine O
that O
there O
are O
no O
better O
restaurants O
in O
Ypres. O

Don't O
get O
me O
wrong, O
it's O
not O
bad, O
but O
not O
really O
great O
either. O

There O
are O
5 O
ladies B-TARGET
to O
serve, O
but O
when O
we O
came O
in O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
ask O
if O
there O
was O
a O
table O
free. O

Later O
in O
the O
evening O
one O
waitress B-TARGET
had O
finished O
her O
work O
so O
she O
started O
picking O
out O
the O
remains O
of O
food O
between O
her O
teeth. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
not O
more O
than O
that. O

The O
3 O
of O
us O
had O
a O
wonderful O
meal O
at O
Capella. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly, O
correct, O
helpful O
and O
very O
pleasant. O

All O
three O
of O
us O
had O
a O
3 B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
which O
was O
really O
delicious. O

I O
had O
ordered O
a O
wine B-TARGET
package I-TARGET
with O
it, O
which O
was O
also O
delicious. O

As O
a O
tip, O
the O
dessert O
could O
also O
be O
served O
with O
a O
dessert O
wine, O
but O
everything O
was O
fine. O

Price/quality O
could O
hardly O
be O
better! O

We O
have O
been O
here O
several O
times O
now O
for O
dinner, O
or O
at O
least O
tried, O
with O
varying O
success. O

After O
several O
times O
waiting O
a O
long O
time O
for O
our O
food O
(+45min!!!), O
the O
last O
time O
we O
ordered O
videe O
and O
stew. O

Even O
this O
took O
half O
an O
hour. O

Not O
worthy O
of O
the O
name O
restaurant, O
serve O
only O
vacuum O
meals O
and O
service B-TARGET
is O
thus O
substandard. O

The O
garden O
could O
be O
nice O
if O
the O
grass O
was O
cut, O
the O
terrace O
even O
nicer O
if O
the O
tables O
were O
clean O
and O
Tienen O
would O
have O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
waiting O
times O
respectable. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
customers O
like O
this O
at O
work, O
my O
C4 O
would O
be O
gone O
soon! O

The O
garden B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
but O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
eat B-TARGET
and O
the O
quality O
is O
poor. O

If O
you O
just O
want O
to O
drink O
something O
it O
is O
a O
must O
because O
the O
garden O
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
the O
drink O
you O
do O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
long O

Very O
nice O
is O
the O
garden B-TARGET
outside, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
also O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
outside O
is O
rather O
chaotic O
with O
its O
moments. O

Inside O
it O
goes O
more O
smoothly. O

For O
the O
third O
time O
this O
year O
we O
have O
again O
deliciously O
enjoyed: O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
still O
conjuring, O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
stylish O
and O
enthusiastic O
all O
around, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
impeccable, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
of O
the O
sommelier O
is O
sublime. O

More O
we O
do O
not O
want O
to O
reveal O
- O
be O
surprised O
by O
the O
paintings O
on O
your O
plate, O
almost O
too O
beautiful O
to O
eat O
but O
do O
it O
anyway O
- O
and O
enjoy O
the O
taste B-TARGET
sensations! I-TARGET

Our O
next O
reservation O
has O
already O
been O
made... O

From O
the O
amuse B-TARGET
bouche I-TARGET
to O
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
all O
the O
flavours O
are O
unbelievable. O

The O
reception O
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
friendly O
and O
well O
cared O
for. O

Of O
course O
pm080 O
is O
completely O
right, O
yet O
she O
forgot O
something. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
Stijn I-TARGET
also O
speaks O
Polish, O
which O
sometimes O
comes O
in O
handy. O

Honest O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
quite O
suitable O
for O
(large) O
company O
but O
not O
immediately O
the O
ideal O
occasion O
for O
a O
romantic O
t√™te O
√† O
t√™te O
with O
your O
beloved; O
a O
bit O
no-nonsense O
and O
quite O
fun, O
moreover O
a O
wide O
menu B-TARGET
and O
certainly O
more O
than O
average O
tasty O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
a O
nice O
concept, O
a O
warm O
interior B-TARGET
and O
is O
not O
touristy. O

However, O
more O
customers O
are O
admitted O
into O
the O
restaurant O
than O
the O
service B-TARGET
can O
handle. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
room O
and O
/ O
or O
to O
keep O
an O
overview. O

The O
regular O
service O
is O
supplemented O
by O
student(s) B-TARGET
who O
mainly O
walk O
back O
and O
forth O
with O
nothing O
or O
one O
something O
in O
their O
hands. O

-friendly O
reception B-TARGET
and O
aperitif O
at O
the O
bar O
(when O
only O
1/3 O
of O
the O
guests O
were O
present) O

- O
Ice B-TARGET
cubes I-TARGET
and O
garnishes B-TARGET
are O
taken O
with O
the O
bare O
hand O
in O
an O
unhygienic O
way. O

-at O
the O
table, O
no O
drink O
menu O
or O
wine O
list O
is O
offered. O

-After O
asking O
a O
second O
time, O
the O
-original- O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
comes. O

-The O
waitress B-TARGET
says O
she O
has O
no O
time O
and O
will O
be O
back O
soon, O
but O
she O
forgets O
this. O

After O
a O
while O
we O
speak O
to O
another O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
does O
have O
the O
time O
to O
remember O
the O
two O
words O
necessary O
to O
express O
our O
choice. O

The O
appetizer O
had O
already O
been O
cleared O
and O
all O
but O
one O
bite O
of O
the O
entree O
was O
finished O
when O
we O
finally O
received O
a O
bottle O
of O
delicious O
Pouilly B-TARGET
Fuiss√© I-TARGET
on O
the O
table. O

Since O
we O
had O
taken O
the O
aperitif O
at O
the O
bar, O
we O
were O
"dry" O
all O
that O
time. O

-the O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
had O
no O
time O
stood O
in O
between O
eating O
fries O
at O
the O
table O
where O
a O
relative O
of O
hers O
was O
sitting O
as O
a O
customer. O

-the O
snack B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
sourly O
fresh. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
tasty. O

-the O
appetizer, O
extra B-TARGET
soft I-TARGET
smoked I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
, O
was O
standard O
wholesale O
quality. O

The O
fatty O
seam O
near O
the O
tail O
of O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
that O
hardens O
when O
smoked O
had O
not O
been O
cut O
away O
by O
the O
kitchen. O

-the O
fondue B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
fries B-TARGET
fresh, O
the O
sauces B-TARGET
industrial. O

-there O
is O
asked O
if O
there O
should O
be O
some O
more O
fries, O
to O
which O
another O
bowl O
quickly O
follows. O

-A O
little O
later O
we O
are O
asked O
if O
there O
is O
any O
meat O
left; O
we O
are O
happy O
to O
answer; O
half O
a O
plate O
will O
do. O

-17 O
minutes O
later O
the O
waitress O
comes O
to O
clear O
away. O

'We O
are O
still O
waiting O
for O
meat' O
we O
replied. O

After O
which O
the O
communication O
goes O
to O
the O
kitchen O
for O
a O
second O
time O
through O
someone O
else O
of O
the O
service. O

Nonchalance O
from O
the O
kitchen O
or O
an O
unclear O
order O
17 O
minutes O
earlier O
from O
the O
service O
to O
the O
kitchen? O

The O
chef O
hurries O
to O
his O
slicer O
and O
the O
meat O
follows. O

The O
fries, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
are O
cold O
by O
now, O
but O
we O
don't O
ask O
for O
any O
more O
hot O
ones, O
who O
knows O
when O
we'll O
get O
them. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
overstaffed O
compared O
to O
the O
hall. O

The O
hall B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
left O
to O
their O
own O
devices: O
pump O
or O
sink. O

The O
stress O
of O
the O
room B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
and O
the O
unnecessary O
(inefficient) O
running O
back O
and O
forth O
radiates O
to O
the O
customers O
and O
determines O
the O
atmosphere O
in O
the O
case. B-TARGET

Enjoyment O
is O
difficult O
here. O

The O
acoustics B-TARGET
is O
a O
tricky O
point. O

From O
a O
small O
clientele O
you O
already O
have O
to O
raise O
your O
voice O
to O
have O
a O
clear O
conversation O
with O
your O
partner. O

An O
acoustic O
stretch O
ceiling, O
3D O
tiles, O
... O
as O
a O
solution? O

If O
during O
the O
service, O
the O
dishes O
are O
washed O
repeatedly O
and O
then O
thrown O
back O
into O
the O
correct O
compartments, O
and O
if O
all O
the O
dishes O
are O
also O
piled O
up O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
without O
any O
care, O
this O
makes O
unnecessary O
noise O
throughout O
the O
room. O

Due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
email O
address O
on O
the O
website, O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
provide O
this O
feedback O
directly O
to O
the O
owner, O
but O
must O
post O
it O
here.... O

Upon O
entering O
this O
restaurant, O
I O
was O
addressed O
in O
French. O

When O
I O
asked O
if O
they O
spoke O
Dutch, O
the O
answer O
was O
"non". O

So O
my O
hunger O
was O
over O
and O
I O
turned O
back. O

I O
read O
the O
negative O
reviews O
on O
Tripadvisor O
when O
we O
were O
already O
sitting O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
restaurant O
Holiday O
and O
was O
a O
bit O
afraid O
VOO O
what O
was O
to O
come.... O

In O
the O
end O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised, O
we O
had O
a O
fine O
service O
from O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
ok, O
I O
took O
the O
fish B-TARGET
suggestion I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
day I-TARGET
and O
this O
was O
a O
correct O
dish O
for O
a O
correct O
price. O

No O
culinary O
highlights O
but O
for O
that O
you O
have O
other O
establishments O
in O
Nieuwpoort. O

I O
think O
the O
negative O
reviews O
are O
very O
exaggerated! O

We O
both O
had O
pizza B-TARGET
frutti I-TARGET
di I-TARGET
mare I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
quite O
ok O
in O
terms O
of O
price/quality. O

Lots O
of O
cheese, B-TARGET
no O
dried O
out O
crust B-TARGET
as O
you O
often O
see, O
actually O
quite O
airy. O

However, O
there O
was O
someone O
serving B-TARGET
who O
couldn't O
speak O
a O
word O
of O
Dutch, O
which O
I O
find O
absolutely O
inappropriate O
for O
Nieuwpoort. O

By O
the O
way, O
with O
our O
aperitif O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
olives O
but O
that O
was O
not O
possible. O

In O
almost O
every O
Italian O
you O
get O
this O
on O
the O
table! O

Not O
here O
... O

But O
what O
we O
got O
was O
delicious. O

The O
Hof B-TARGET
van I-TARGET
Heusden I-TARGET
is O
in O
itself O
what O
a O
special O
location. O

Indeed, O
when O
entering O
it O
looks O
more O
like O
a O
cafe O
-and O
it O
is, O
because O
you O
can O
just O
drink O
or O
eat O
something. O

But O
at O
the O
back O
is O
the O
restaurant. O

And O
the O
restaurant O
has O
a O
large O
terrace. O

So O
just O
walk O
through O
the O
caf√© O
to O
the O
restaurant. O

And O
it O
is O
quite O
cozy! O

Abdel B-TARGET
is O
top: O
he O
cooks O
very O
well O
and O
we O
especially O
think O
he O
is O
a O
master O
in O
preparing O
game. O

So O
in O
the O
game O
season: O
all O
go O
there! O

In O
the O
summer O
there O
is O
a O
large O
terrace O
with O
a O
garden. O

We O
like O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
mainly O
because O
of O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
friendliness O
of O
Abdel B-TARGET
. O

And O
we O
love O
to O
visit O
especially O
in O
the O
winter O
months! O

Monthly O
menu: O
The O
' O
gourmet B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
' O
consisted O
of O
a O
toast O
of O
1 O
square O
centimeter O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
pate O
on O
it O
and O
something O
similar O
to O
onion O
confit. O

The O
butter B-TARGET
we O
received O
with O
the O
3 O
pieces O
of O
bread O
(for O
2 O
people) O
had O
the O
expiration O
date O
12/12/13 O
(almost O
a O
month O
past O
the O
date) O

The O
carpacio B-TARGET
(tataki O
on O
the O
menu) O
was O
watery O
and O
uninspiring. O

The O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
(pork O
cheeks) O
was O
tasty. O

The O
wines B-TARGET
can O
only O
be O
ordered O
by O
the O
glass O
or O
half O
liter??? O
except O
for O
the O
house O
wine. O

That O
could O
be O
ordered O
by O
the O
bottle. O

So O
I O
assume O
the O
"better O
wines" O
come O
from O
a O
barrel? O

The O
room O
was O
full O
of O
people O
who O
came O
to O
eat O
with O
the O
Groupon O
coupon. O

Their O
menu O
which O
cost O
about O
half O
of O
ours O
looked O
much O
better O
in O
any O
case. O

The O
case O
lacks O
atmosphere B-TARGET
, O
we O
have O
absolutely O
no O
good O
feeling O
after O
this O
dinner. O

There O
are O
many O
restos O
in O
Destelbergen O
and O
Heusden O
with O
a O
much O
better O
price-quality O
ratio. O

Here O
is O
still O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
to O
do.... O

We O
had O
chosen O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
Groupon O
voucher. O

But O
we O
were O
disappointed O
upon O
arrival. O

It O
was O
exactly O
a O
cafe O
where O
you O
go O
for O
a O
drink O
and O
it O
was O
certainly O
not O
romantically O
decorated. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
nicely O
presented O
on O
the O
plate. O

But O
the O
staff B-TARGET
couldn't O
help O
but O
smile. O

Already O
5 O
times O
I O
visited O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
never O
had O
a O
disappointment. O

(Otherwise O
you O
do O
not O
come O
back) O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
always O
welcoming O
and O
price O
/ O
quality O
is O
excellent. O

This O
weekend O
I O
enjoyed O
the O
degustation B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
inspired O
by O
the O
game O
season. O

The O
amuse B-TARGET
is O
already O
surprising O
and O
a O
harbinger O
of O
a O
promising O
menu. O

Carpaccio B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wild O
boar, O
partridge B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
beet I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
wild I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
are O
all O
surprising O
combinations. O

Finish O
with O
vanilla O
ice O
cream O
and O
blueberries O
and O
the O
evening O
is O
guaranteed. O

5 O
courses O
for O
45.00 O
euro O
is O
a O
fair O
price O
for O
an O
excellent O
menu. B-TARGET

Reservations O
with O
the O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
were O
always O
successful. O

Agree O
that O
a O
gourmet O
box O
for O
the O
little O
ones O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
fast O
food-like O
but O
they O
just O
like O
it. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
top O
but O
young O
talent O
deserves O
and O
backing. O

We O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
regularly O
because O
you O
can O
find O
the O
best O
pizza B-TARGET
in O
the O
area. O

It's O
not O
for O
nothing O
that O
Mateo B-TARGET
was O
voted O
the O
best O
pizza O
chef O
in O
East O
Flanders. O

Moreover, O
we O
love O
the O
cozy O
family O
atmosphere B-TARGET
. O

There O
is O
an O
excellent O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
which O
is O
regularly O
updated. O

The O
regular O
menu B-TARGET
also O
changes O
regularly. O

We O
do O
try O
to O
avoid O
weekends O
because O
it O
can O
get O
pretty O
busy. O

Everyone O
does O
their O
best O
to O
please O
the O
customers, O
but O
one O
can O
not O
do O
more O
than O
humanly O
possible. O

Victim O
of O
their O
own O
success O
one O
could O
say. O

Reservation O
and O
information O
is O
the O
message. O

Nothing O
warm, O
friendly! O

Just O
rude O
service. B-TARGET

As O
if O
everything O
was O
against O
her O
will. O

I O
hope O
this O
was O
a O
snapshot O
(bad O
day) O

In O
any O
case, O
we O
will O
NEVER O
come O
back O
here. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
bad, O
but O
that O
could O
not O
make O
up O
for O
the O
rudeness O
of O
the O
hostess. B-TARGET

Plenty O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Destelbergen O
where O
they O
don't O
work O
against O
their O
will. O

Initially, O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
had O
some O
"threshold O
fear" O
to O
enter O
here, O
as O
the O
interior B-TARGET
looked O
a O
bit O
messy. O

But O
we O
overcame O
our O
fears O
and O
got O
the O
surprise O
of O
our O
lives! O

We O
were O
warmly O
welcomed O
and O
immediately O
felt O
at O
home O
in O
this O
friendly, O
family O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Not O
fancy O
at O
all, O
rather O
simple, O
you O
imagine O
yourself O
in O
an O
Italian O
living O
room O
... O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
never O
have O
I O
felt O
Italy O
so O
close O
as O
in O
Etna B-TARGET
. O

The O
chef B-TARGET
has O
won O
awards O
for O
"best O
pizzaiolo O
in O
Flanders'' O
and O
is O
very O
proud O
of O
this. O

The O
pictures O
and O
certificates O
are O
hanging O
on O
the O
wall. O

So O
far O
my O
best O
experience O
with O
authentic O
Italian O
cuisine O
in O
our O
little O
Belgium. O

The O
price O
is O
also O
very O
reasonable. O

I O
will O
definitely O
be O
back, O
definitely!!!! O

Great O
pasta B-TARGET
and O
pizza! B-TARGET

The O
chef, O
Mateo, O
is O
Italian. O

Warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
good O
to O
make O
reservations O
in O
advance. O

The O
price O
is O
average. O

Also O
the O
formula B-TARGET
'pizza I-TARGET
party I-TARGET
' O
is O
a O
hit!!! O

In O
the O
summer O
large O
sun B-TARGET
terrace I-TARGET
. O

I O
had O
asked O
for O
a O
steak B-TARGET
saignant I-TARGET
but O
this O
was O
medium O
to O
bien O
cuit. O

When O
I O
commented O
on O
this O
I O
just O
got O
the O
same O
meat O
back O
saying O
I O
was O
wrong O
. O

For O
the O
rest O
little O
creative O
cuisine B-TARGET
. O

Not O
recommended. O

Sunday, O
March O
30, O
beautiful O
weather O
so O
terrace O
on O
the O
way: O
Quite O
a O
few O
customers O
and O
enough O
staff B-TARGET
who O
were O
not O
interested O
in O
serving O
the O
people. O

We O
have O
there O
a O
thick O
half O
hour O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
, O
who O
strolled O
by O
without O
enioge O
order O
to O
take. O

Finally, O
hungry O
and O
thirsty, O
we O
got O
back O
on O
the O
bus. O

Such O
a O
rude, O
and O
uninterested O
service B-TARGET
I O
have O
never O
experienced. O

Simply O
incomprehensible. O

They O
will O
NEVER O
see O
us O
there O
again. O

" O
The O
latest O
addition O
"has O
the O
main O
advantage O
of O
a O
beautiful O
garden B-TARGET
where O
families O
with O
children O
and O
larger O
groups O
can O
enjoy O
themselves, O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
current O
management O
has O
drastically O
changed O
the O
concept. O

On O
Sunday O
afternoon O
there O
is O
"animation" O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
"dinner O
show", O
a O
package O
that O
costs O
‚Ç¨ O
70, O
- O
but O
then O
you O
get O
entertainment O
from O
schlager O
gods O
√† O
la O
Frank O
Galan, O
Danny O
Fabri, O
Paul O
Severs O
and O
tutti O
quanti. O

Only O
suitable O
for O
a O
limited O
niche O
audience. O

We O
thought O
we O
would O
eat O
something O
quietly O
in O
the O
garden B-TARGET
(then O
you O
don't O
pay O
the O
‚Ç¨70 O
and O
you O
can O
only O
order O
from O
the O
snacks O
menu) O
but O
even O
there O
the O
decibels O
are O
generously O
sent O
in O
your O
direction O
(poor O
neighbors!). O

We O
ate O
quickly O
and O
without O
taste O
and O
made O
to O
leave O
again. O

Do O
you O
like O
Flemish O
and O
other O
schlagers: O
go O
for O
it, O
don't O
pay O
‚Ç¨70 O
and O
put O
yourself O
in O
the O
garden; O
don't O
like O
it, O
just O
stay O
away. O

The O
new O
building O
looks O
like O
a O
public O
swimming O
pool O
or O
gymnasium. O

How O
does O
one O
get O
it O
into O
his O
head O
to O
renew O
a O
business O
with O
tradition O
and O
nostalgia O
in O
such O
a O
terrible O
way! O

cosiness O
is O
here O
miles O
away! O

You O
can O
quietly O
eat O
and O
drink, O
prices O
are O
slightly O
higher O
than O
usual O
but O
you O
get O
value O
for O
money. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
playground O
for O
children O
and O
in O
the O
summer O
it O
is O
certainly O
cozy O
to O
stay O
here. O

No O
problem O
to O
get O
a O
meal O
in O
this O
restaurant O
/ O
cafe O
around O
21h30. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
smooth O
and O
happened O
quickly. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
room O
to O
sit O
in O
this O
establishment, O
yet O
they O
manage O
to O
get O
almost O
all O
the O
seats O
occupied O
even O
on O
a O
weekday. O

Breakfast B-TARGET
was O
again O
excellent! O

Excellent O
organization, B-TARGET
lots O
of O
variety, O
something O
for O
everyone. O

Friendly O
service, B-TARGET
cozy O
interior B-TARGET
and O
all O
that O
in O
a O
beautiful O
green O
location. B-TARGET

We O
will O
be O
back O
again! O

Very O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
fantastic O
setting B-TARGET
in O
the O
woods, O
ideal O
as O
a O
bicycle O
stop O
where O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
also O
worth O
just O
going O
for O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
terrace O
next O
to O
the O
gempemolen O

Very O
tasty, O
friendly O
reception, B-TARGET
super O
good O
service, B-TARGET
helpful O
and O
perfect O
explanation O
of O
the O
dishes! O

Price O
quality O
is O
perfect! O

Nice O
choices B-TARGET
, O
very O
balanced O
, O
very O
well O
trained O
and O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
. O

Nice O
meals B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
wines B-TARGET
, O
pricey O
though. O

We O
have O
gone O
there O
several O
times O
for O
dinner. O

Every O
time O
DENISE!!! O

Super O
friendly O
hostess B-TARGET
! O

Fantastically O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
! O

A O
real O
taste O
festival! O

So O
far O
no O
other O
restaurant O
that O
can O
match O
this! O

Unfriendly O
people B-TARGET
-crazy O
-worst O
food B-TARGET
ever O
-don't O
go O
there!!!! O

And O
then O
people O
in O
the O
hospitality O
industry O
complain.... O

In O
the O
context O
of O
a O
flairbon O
we O
have O
reserved O
at O
"the O
mein" O
the O
soup B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
asparagus I-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
no O
bread, O
butter O
served. O

the O
beef B-TARGET
brochette I-TARGET
was O
marbled O
and O
tough O
(all O
5 O
cubes O
on O
the O
skewer) O
and O
ate O
like O
chewing O
gum. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
(salmon) O
was O
tasty, O
but O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
asked O
for O
some O
butter O
sauce O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
answered: O
"we O
are O
out O
of O
sauce. O

For O
the O
third B-TARGET
course, I-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
cr√®me O
brull√©e O
on O
offer O
while O
this O
was O
specified O
in O
the O
voucher. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
decaffeinated O
coffee O

you O
guessed O
the O
answer, O
"Isn't O
there". O

The O
night O
that O
followed O
was O
hell. O

My O
wife O
vomited O
all O
night O
and O
had O
diarrhea. O

So O
final O
conclusion: O
still O
paid O
too O
much O
and O
came O
in O
at O
18h O
sharp O
and O
went O
out O
at O
21.15h. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
also O
not O
overly O
friendly O
and O
quite O
surly.... O

after O
not O
enjoying O
the O
reservation O
(according O
to O
vivabox) O
they O
never O
wanted O
to O
serve O
us, O
and O
this O
after O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
of O
waiting. O

Congratulations O
and O
good O
luck O
in O
the O
future.... O

Downright O
outrageous O
what O
they O
serve. O

Never O
eaten O
so O
bad O
before. O

Got O
steppe B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
soupy I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
that O
had O
been O
sticking O
tss O
grill O
for O
a O
while. O

Does O
not O
even O
qualify O
for O
frying. O

Just O
stop O
this. O

In O
my O
experience O
there O
was O
a O
reservation O
for O
lunch O
outside O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
inside O
in O
a O
separate O
room. O

It O
was O
extremely O
noisy O
and O
loud. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
fine O
but O
I O
would O
still O
prefer O
a O
more O
pleasant O
ambiance B-TARGET
on O
a O
beautiful O
spring O
day.............. O

We O
agreed O
on O
a O
menu O
in O
advance O
for O
a O
group O
of O
10 O
people. O

Correct O
price O
for O
a O
3-course B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
(each O
time O
fish O
or O
meat), O
including O
drinks O
and O
aperitif. O

Quality O
certainly O
in O
order, O
to O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
the O
participants. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O

Through O
acquaintances O
we O
had O
received O
the O
advice O
to O
dine O
here O
once. O

We O
had O
dinner O
here O
the O
evening O
before O
Valentine's O
Day. O

There O
was O
just O
a O
table O
of O
2 O
free O
and O
ordered O
the O
Valentine's O
menu. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
really O
good O
and O
we O
knew O
immediately O
that O
we O
should O
come O
here O
more O
often. O

Really O
a O
must O
for O
a O
nice O
dinner. O

Moreover, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
there O
was O
a O
nice O
gift O
for O
Valentine's O
Day. O

Reservations O
a O
hopeless O
case. O

Booked O
2x, O
2x O
not O
on O
list!!!! O

Confirmation O
email O
from O
Social O
Deal O
shown, O
come, O
give, O
and O
put! O

welcome! O

forget O
it... O

Waited O
1/2 O
hour O
for O
first O
tapas. O

Wasn't O
too O
bad, O
but O
serrano B-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
baguette I-TARGET
can't O
be O
too O
bad. O

Another O
1/2 O
hour O
wait O
for O
yet O
another O
miniscule O
portion B-TARGET
. O

eat O
tapas O
as O
much...as O
you O
want? O

they O
decide O
how O
much O
you O
eat, O
if O
you O
are O
lucky O
you O
get O
4x3 O
portions, O
if O
they O
don't O
feel O
like O
it, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
make O
do O
with O
less! O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
did O
her O
best, O
but O
the O
boss B-TARGET
(?) O
should O
take O
a O
course O
in O
reception, O
bah O
bah. O

Can O
'allegedly' O
not O
speak O
Dutch O
very O
well, O
what O
a O
joke, O
was O
complaining O
to O
acquaintances O
about O
Social O
Deal O
and O
the O
influx O
of O
guests O
that O
this O
formula O
brought O
with O
it, O
in O
perfect O
Dutch O
... O

Exists O
for O
1 O
year O
now, O
wonder O
what O
it O
will O
be O
like O
next O
year. O

Do O
not O
think O
that O
many O
people O
go O
for O
a O
2nd O
time, O
which O
is O
ultimately O
the O
intention. O

Missed O
opportunity, O
a O
pity, O
because O
the O
cook B-TARGET
is O
not O
to O
blame. O

We O
went O
with O
the O
whole O
family O
to O
dinner O
at O
19.00, O
at O
19.30 O
we O
received O
the O
drinks O
card, O
at O
19.40 O
we O
had O
to O
pass O
on O
the O
order O
for O
the O
food. O

None O
of O
the O
tapas O
we O
ordered O
were O
on O
the O
table O
at O
the O
same O
time O
and O
there O
were O
also O
some O
tapas O
missing O
which O
we O
had O
passed O
on. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
very O
poor, O
while O
there O
was O
not O
much O
clientele. O

Everything O
was O
too O
much O
for O
them. O

We O
could O
eat O
unlimited O
tapas O
for O
2 O
hours O
but O
at O
20.55 O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
said O
that O
the O
kitchen O
was O
closed O
at O
21.00. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
very O
bad, O
we O
would O
have O
been O
better O
off O
going O
to O
a O
chip O
shop!!! O

Not O
recommended O
so!!!! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
horrible, O
no O
explanation O
and O
with O
difficulty O
we O
could O
order O
2x O
(where O
the O
lady B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
service I-TARGET
also O
looked O
impatiently O
at O
her O
watch) O
when O
you O
waved O
/ O
called O
in O
one O
way O
or O
another O
to O
attract O
her O
attention O
she O
just O
seemed O
to O
ignore O
it. O

Too O
bad O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
to O
go! O

First O
I O
tried O
for O
months O
to O
reserve O
with O
the O
voucher O
of O
social O
deal, O
through O
the O
website O
social O
deal O
not O
possible, O
then O
I O
tried O
by O
phone, O
I O
got O
a O
very O
rude O
barking O
that O
I O
had O
to O
reserve O
by O
computer, O
tried O
again, O
no O
possibility, O
after O
complaining O
in O
writing O
to O
social O
deal O
I O
finally O
got O
a O
reservation.... O
what O
did O
we O
see O
there... O
very O
dirty, O
bad O
flavors B-TARGET
, O
terrible O
service B-TARGET
, O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
on O
the O
menu O
were O
suddenly O
served O
with O
different O
vegetables, O
and O
yet.... O
staff B-TARGET
"sits O
or O
stands" O
plenty, O
but O
they O
don't O
move O
from O
their O
seats.... O

NO O
MORE....!!!! O

Sunday O
we O
went O
for O
breakfast O
with O
4 O
adults, O
already O
for O
the O
third O
time. O

Highly O
recommended. O

We O
took O
the O
luxury B-TARGET
breakfast I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
indeed O
luxurious. O

Very O
nice O
bread B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
pastries, I-TARGET
enough O
bread, B-TARGET
very O
tasty O
ham B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
good O
coffee, B-TARGET
the O
tea B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
milk I-TARGET
are O
definitely O
recommended. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
you O
breakfast O
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting B-TARGET
. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
this O
business B-TARGET
in O
Damme. O

One O
of O
the O
few O
businesses O
where O
the O
customer O
is O
still O
really O
king. O

We O
had O
a O
cottage O
in O
the O
area O
without O
breakfast. O

Because O
of O
the O
reviews O
here O
on O
the O
site O
we O
chose O
this O
place O
for O
breakfast. O

And O
what O
a O
treat. O

As O
soon O
as O
you O
open O
the O
door O
the O
delicious O
pastries B-TARGET
jump O
out O
at O
you. O

We O
chose O
a O
luxury B-TARGET
breakfast I-TARGET
for O
‚Ç¨10,-pp O
and O
what O
a O
treat O
that O
was. O

Two O
sandwiches O
of O
your O
choice. O

Hard, O
soft, O
multigrain O
... O
you O
name O
it. O

And O
a O
choice B-TARGET
of O
a O
"coffee O
roll"...or O
a O
real O
coffee O
roll O
but O
also O
croissants O
(with O
or O
without O
chocolate) O
or O
other O
delicious O
bread. B-TARGET

Furthermore, O
a O
glass O
of B-TARGET
orange I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
(not O
fresh O
but O
still O
very O
tasty) O
coffee B-TARGET
as O
much O
as O
you O
want. O

A O
freshly O
boiled O
egg, B-TARGET
standard O
perfectly O
soft, O
on O
request O
slightly O
harder. O

The O
filling O
consists O
of O
slices O
of O
ham O
and O
cheese. O

Jam O
and O
nutella O
and O
speculoos. O

All O
in O
all....enough. O

More O
than O
enough. O

It O
was O
so O
good O
that O
we O
just O
came O
back O
here O
the O
2nd O
day. O

Super O
friendly O
woman B-TARGET
behind O
the O
counter O
that O
we O
had O
whole O
conversations O
with, O
open O
and O
honest! O

For O
the O
complete O
picture...... O

Highly O
recommended. O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
and O
good O
food B-TARGET

One O
is O
quickly O
served O

The O
scampies B-TARGET
doable I-TARGET
are O
super O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
are O
even O
better O
than O
in O
most O
restaurants. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
absolutely O
not O
recommended O
for O
a O
nice O
evening O
out O
to O
eat. O

Since O
we O
did O
not O
have O
a O
good O
feeling O
when O
we O
entered O
the O
restaurant O
and O
actually O
thought O
it O
inappropriate O
to O
leave O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
we O
did O
not O
order O
an O
appetizer. O

We O
were O
the O
only O
guests O
at O
that O
time. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
mediocre, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
sat O
all O
the O
time O
behind O
his O
computer O
after O
preparing O
the O
main O
course. O

The O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
was O
tasty. O

After O
having O
chosen O
a O
dessert, B-TARGET
which O
was O
disappointing, O
we O
finally O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
bill O
in O
cash. O

Once O
but O
never O
again! O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
owner B-TARGET
arrogant, O
but O
he O
also O
calls O
his O
customers O
names! O

Both O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
hotel O
are O
to O
be O
avoided O
like O
the O
plague! O

In O
the O
rooms O
there O
is O
fish O
smell O
and O
kitchen O
noise. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
mediocre O
and O
definitely O
not O
worth O
its O
price. O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
here O
with O
another O
couple O
and O
immediately O
chose O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
real O
Belgian. O

Tomato O
shrimp-slime O
dumplings-Dame O
Blanche: O
didn't O
look O
bad. O

And O
it O
certainly O
wasn't O
bad O
if O
you O
opt O
for O
a O
cafe-restaurant O
somewhere O
in O
the O
center O
of O
a O
city. O

But O
if O
your O
boss O
consciously O
chooses O
a O
restaurant O
then O
the O
whole B-TARGET
could O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
refined O
and O
the O
entourage B-TARGET
a O
bit O
cozier. O

A O
repeat O
of O
past O
mistakes O
in O
Oostkerke? O

The O
shrimp B-TARGET
were O
good, O
the O
sole B-TARGET
was O
well O
cooked O
but O
for O
that O
price O
the O
presentation B-TARGET
could O
be O
a O
lot O
better. O

Now O
everything O
seemed O
to O
be O
swirled O
and O
maybe O
it O
was, O
the O
cook B-TARGET
(patron) O
we O
saw O
regularly O
sitting O
at O
his O
computer O
at O
a O
table O
in O
the O
restaurant O
to O
the O
annoyance O
of O
our O
partners O
who O
were O
constantly O
looking O
at O
it. O

The O
unfriendliness O
of O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
both O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
during O
our O
entire O
meal O
was O
downright O
annoying O
and O
also O
the O
clicking O
of O
her O
shoes O
drew O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
customers O
present O
so O
that O
they O
could O
no O
longer O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
the O
food. O

When O
we O
checked O
out O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
we O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
pay O
with O
cash O
because O
their O
machine O
was O
supposedly O
broken. O

So O
we O
had O
to O
go O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
an O
ATM O
to O
end O
this O
less O
than O
pleasant O
evening. O

We O
do O
not O
dare O
to O
bring O
friends O
here O
anymore. O

Yesterday O
we O
enjoyed O
ALL O
of O
it O
in O
the B-TARGET
South I-TARGET
Side. I-TARGET

the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
TOP, O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
SHITTEREND, O
the O
custom B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
SUPER, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
VERY O
WARM O
and O
cozy O
and O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
, O
incredibly O
CHARMANT, O
it O
was O
enjoyment O
in O
the O
greatest O
sense O
of O
the O
word! O

The O
birthday O
boy O
could O
not O
have O
made O
a O
better O
choice. O

We O
chose O
the O
menu O
and O
custom O
wines. O

Four O
courses B-TARGET
, O
sufficiently O
large O
portions O
and O
a O
caress O
for O
the O
taste O
buds. O

The O
selected O
wine B-TARGET
was O
SU-PER! O

The O
friendly O
and O
smooth O
service B-TARGET
and O
also O
the O
explanation O
of O
the O
dishes O
made O
this O
evening O
unforgettable! O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back! O

Very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
perfect O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
relaxed O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
hostess B-TARGET
gives O
you O
a O
warm O
welcome: O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back!!! O

Very O
good O
food. O

I O
indicated O
in O
advance O
that O
I O
did O
not O
eat O
fish. O

I O
got O
2 O
beautifully O
adapted O
dishes. O

However, O
here O
was O
a O
supplement O
charged, O
which O
was O
not O
discussed. O

That O
was O
a O
minus O
point.... O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
, O
wine B-TARGET
, O
dishes B-TARGET
top! O

We O
ate O
a O
3 O
course O
menu. O

Everything O
was O
fine O
and O
cared O
for. O

Beautiful O
presentation B-TARGET
. O

Cozy O
and O
beautiful O
interior B-TARGET
. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
provides O
a O
nice O
welcome O
and O
is O
very O
attentive O
. O

We O
went O
during O
a O
day O
at O
sea O
along O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

A O
plus O
for O
the O
location, B-TARGET
because O
you O
are O
just O
outside O
the O
bustle O
of O
the O
coast O
in O
the O
center O
of O
De O
Haan. O

Parking O
is O
no O
problem. O

We O
were O
very O
thoughtfully O
and O
promptly O
received O
by O
the O
owner B-TARGET
who O
could O
immediately O
give O
tips O
about O
the O
best O
places O
on O
the O
terrace. O

The O
monthly B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
very O
nice. O

My O
starter B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
basi I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tomato, I-TARGET
mozzarella I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
basil I-TARGET
was O
surprising, O
fresh O
and O
contemporary. O

A O
real O
taste O
bomb! O

The O
carpaccio B-TARGET
on O
the O
other O
side O
fresh O
and O
wafer-thin, O
but O
to O
my O
husband's O
taste O
provided O
with O
a O
little O
too O
much O
olive O
oil. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
that O
came O
with O
it O
was O
top O
notch! O

The O
main B-TARGET
courses I-TARGET
were O
again O
very O
fine O
and O
flavorful. O

The O
cod B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
black I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
delicious! O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
kind O
of O
soup O
based O
on O
fruits O
and O
vegetables O
and O
less O
our O
thing. O

But O
overall, O
delicious O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
friendly O
and O
warm O
setting B-TARGET
! O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
beautiful O
decor B-TARGET
and O
loose O
friendly O
reception B-TARGET
. O

What O
we O
got O
on O
the O
plate O
was O
of O
a O
very O
high O
standard. O

Not O
what O
you O
expect O
in O
a O
small O
polder O
village. O

You O
clearly O
notice O
that O
here O
super O
highly O
trained O
but O
still O
simple O
sympathetic O
people B-TARGET
are O
at O
work. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
here O
because O
we O
are O
curious O
about O
other O
dishes O
that O
they O
conjure O
up. O

Highly O
recommended! O

The O
chef B-TARGET
conjures O
up O
the O
flavors O
on O
your O
plate, O
while O
Tine B-TARGET
serves O
you O
with O
a O
smile. O

A O
super O
experience, O
The O
choice O
between O
2 O
menus O
is O
so O
difficult O
because O
everything O
is O
delicious. O

Already O
third O
time O
we O
ate O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

Every O
time O
top O
from O
a O
to O
z. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
smooth O
and O
pleasant. O

Tinne B-TARGET
always O
knows O
how O
to O
surprise O
us; O

All O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty O
at O
a O
very O
high O
level. O

Very O
nice O
creations O
of O
the O
chef B-TARGET
who O
works O
with O
fresh O
products. B-TARGET

Simply O
the O
best O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Worth O
at O
least O
one O
star. O

Delicious O
food, B-TARGET
beautiful O
surroundings, B-TARGET
great O
service B-TARGET
yet O
one O
flaw. O

It O
says O
lunch B-TARGET
always O
at O
‚Ç¨ O
37 O
and O
they O
charged O
‚Ç¨ O
42 O
because O
it O
was O
a O
Sunday O
(July O
21). O

I O
did O
not O
think O
that O
was O
fair. O

Outside O
again O
checked O
and O
there O
is O
indeed O
always O
‚Ç¨ O
37. O

Where O
to O
start? O

no O
idea, O
maybe O
staff? O

rude O
(maw O
know O
not O
the O
etiquette O
that O
belongs O
to O
a O
brasserie O
/ O
cafe O
/ O
tavern. O

drinks B-TARGET
are O
served O
in O
half O
to O
almost O
dirty O
glasses O
(lipstick O
and O
the O
like O
from O
previous O
guests) O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
to O
mention. O

all B-TARGET
tastes O
like O
it's O
just O
ready O
meals O
heated O
up O
in O
a O
microwave. O

Sauces, B-TARGET
I O
think O
the O
jars O
are O
still O
half O
open O
and O
out O
of O
date. O

Then O
my O
homemade O
mayonnaise, O
which O
is O
completely O
rotten, O
tastes O
even O
better. O

will O
not O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
whole O
thing B-TARGET
in O
general. O

for O
me O
never O
again, O
then O
even O
better O
to O
the O
pigsty O
on O
a O
farm, O
there O
it O
is O
cleaner O
and O
much O
better O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
and O
service. O

We O
were O
here O
on O
n O
aggressive O
way O
deprived O
of O
80 O
‚Ç¨ O
and O
our O
food. O

After O
3 O
times O
asking O
for O
sauce O
and O
always O
being O
served O
terrible O
sauce, B-TARGET
I O
went O
to O
tell O
the O
manager O
(not O
to O
mention O
fritte, O
chicken). O

He O
became O
increasingly O
unfriendly, O
when O
I O
replied O
that O
the O
customer O
was O
still O
king, O
he O
only O
got O
angrier. O

I O
told O
him O
that O
with O
such O
service B-TARGET
I O
was O
not O
inclined O
to O
pay. O

I O
went O
back O
to O
wife O
and O
children O
zitte. O

Yet O
mr O
continuing O
to O
eat O
for O
our O
hungry O
kids O
was O
suddenly O
the O
waiter O
along O
us. O

PAY! O

NOW!!!! O

We O
urged O
him O
to O
calm O
down, O
but O
after O
several O
times O
this O
did O
not O
work. O

He O
took O
the O
food O
from O
under O
our O
noses, O
threw O
a O
terrace O
chair O
and O
became O
fiercer O
and O
fiercer. O

At O
that O
moment O
he O
was O
joined O
by O
all O
the O
staff O
members O
and O
the O
patron, B-TARGET
the O
latter O
had O
even O
brought O
the O
baseball O
bat. O

So O
I O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
pay. O

Afterwards O
I O
called O
the O
police O
but O
they O
couldn't O
do O
anything O
except O
listen O
to O
me. O

So O
I O
hope O
that O
people O
stay O
away O
from O
here O
and O
be O
spared O
from O
their O
bad O
food B-TARGET
and O
rock-hard O
aggressive O
services. B-TARGET

Astoria B-TARGET
palace I-TARGET
may O
your O
business O
go O
bust!!!! O

Dirty O
thieves!!! O

Chicken B-TARGET
was O
dry, O
fish B-TARGET
was O
not O
tasty O
(had O
a O
really O
foul O
smell O
to O
it) O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
tasted O
like O
soap O
suds, O
fries B-TARGET
were O
limp O
and O
very O
greasy, O
potatoes B-TARGET
not O
cooked, O
glasses B-TARGET
not O
clean. O

After O
we O
complained O
about O
the O
above O
mentioned O
findings, O
they O
indignantly O
waved O
everything O
away O
and O
just O
had O
to O
pay O
full O
price. O

Staff B-TARGET
with O
dirty O
clothes, O
inside O
it O
didn't O
look O
very O
"clean". O

In O
short, O
with O
a O
big O
bow O
around O
this O
establishment! B-TARGET

Booked O
and O
waited O
outside O
for O
10 O
min O
with O
another O
couple O
who O
had O
to O
be O
there, O
3 O
hours O
waiting O
for O
a O
third O
appetizer, O
when O
we O
made O
the O
comment O
we O
were O
asked O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
manager, O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
smile O
on O
the O
manager's B-TARGET
face O
when O
we O
decided O
to O
pay O
the O
cook B-TARGET
simply O
said O
that O
we O
show O
no O
respect O
to O
the O
kitchen, O
we O
are O
people O
who O
regularly O
eat O
but O
I O
have O
not O
experienced O
this, O
sorry O
but O
a O
customer O
does O
not O
want O
to O
be O
treated O
like O
this O
when O
he O
pays O
an O
expensive O
bill, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
had O
to O
wait O
too O
long O
sorry O

Yesterday O
we O
had O
dinner O
at O
Boury's, B-TARGET
sorry O
but O
I O
don't O
understand O
why O
this O
place O
deserves O
a O
star, O
the O
service B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
manageress I-TARGET
leaves O
everything O
to O
be O
desired, O
she O
can't O
even O
smile O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
supposed O
to O
be O
warm O
were O
cold, O
an O
expensive O
bill B-TARGET
and O
not O
a O
good O
meal, O
a O
snarl O
and O
a O
growl O
at O
the O
checkout, O
sorry O
but O
if O
you O
pay O
this O
price, O
I O
think O
some O
people O
should O
reconsider, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
but O
a O
bistro O
for O
me, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
apologized O
at O
the O
table O
for O
the O
behavior O
of O
their O
superiors, O
I O
really O
can't O
recommend O
this O
place O

from O
the O
moment O
we O
entered O
we O
felt O
welcome. O

The O
apero O
was O
followed O
by O
several O
appetizers. O

the O
starter B-TARGET
and O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
were O
really O
beautiful. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
mignardises B-TARGET
with O
the O
coffee O
were O
the O
perfect O
end. O

the O
unusual O
wines B-TARGET
were O
real O
discoveries. O

In O
short: O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
must-see! O

a O
big O
congratulations O
to O
the O
whole O
Boury B-TARGET
team! I-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
nice, O
original O
brasserie B-TARGET
where O
you O
are O
always O
welcome O
and O
get O
delicious O
fresh O
products; B-TARGET

A O
minus O
I O
think O
is O
the O
price, O
with O
2 O
people O
you're O
quickly O
over O
120 O
euros. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
well O
when O
you're O
in O
Veurne, O
then O
you O
should O
definitely O
visit O
Lowie. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
cozy, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
fast O
and O
especially O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

Honest O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
if O
you O
like O
steak B-TARGET
tartare I-TARGET
then O
you O
should O
definitely O
try O
it O
with O
the O
home-cut O
and O
fried O
fries. O

I O
had O
a O
customer O
to O
spoil O
in O
Veurne. O

I O
remembered O
the O
previous O
super O
evening, O
so O
I O
took O
no O
risk O
and O
went O
to O
visit O
this O
brasserie. O

Croquettes O
of O
sweetbreads, O
and O
other O
fine O
house B-TARGET
specialties, I-TARGET
and O
suggestion, O
etc. O

And O
closing O
with O
some O
funny O
annecdotes, O
my O
client O
was O
over O
the O
moon! O

This O
is O
for O
me O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
in O
Belgium, O
original O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
custom O
plates, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
sublime O

Eating O
here O
is O
an O
experience. O

Adapted O
meals O
for O
things O
you O
do O
not O
like O
were O
absolutely O
no O
problem. O

Super O
nice O
food, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
sublime O
wine. B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
the O
top O
of O
the O
bill O
with O
the O
forest O
walk. O

A O
forest O
scene O
made O
of O
chocolate O
on O
a O
plate O
of O
branches O
and O
moss O
with O
morning O
dew O
rising O
from O
a O
jar. O

This O
is O
truly O
enjoyable! O

Why O
not O
yet O
2 O
stars? O

Parking B-TARGET
and O
surroundings B-TARGET
not O
inviting O
but O
what O

Careful O

service, B-TARGET
eye-catching O

for O
daring O
to O
create O
new O
flavors. O

Perfect O
balance O
between O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
unique O
meal B-TARGET
. O

The O
chef O
asked O
if O
he O
could O
indulge O
himself O
on O
the O
culinary O
level. O

He O
did O
this O
in O
a O
magnificent O
way. O

Each O
dish B-TARGET
was O
a O
delight O
for O
the O
tongue O
and O
the O
eye. O

The O
matching O
wines B-TARGET
made O
the O
unique O
experience O
complete. O

You O
feel O
that O
the O
chef B-TARGET
and O
his O
ma√Ætre O
do O
this O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
passion. O

Grateful O
we O
look O
back O
on O
a O
wonderful O

India', I-TARGET
a O
must O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
get O

You O
get O
a O
little O

what O
sauces O
go O
best O
with O
each O
dish. O

We O
could O
taste O
lamb, B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
scampi I-TARGET
prepared O
in O
different O
ways. O

Very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O

(we O
chose O
the O
custom O
wines). O

Everything O
is O
freshly O
prepared, O

yourself O
to O
be O

India! O

Definitely O
recommended O
and O
worth O
repeating. O

Definitely O

not O
too O
spicy O
and O
all O
at O
a O
fair O
price. O

Also O
the O
lunch O
is O
a O
must: O
a O
caress O
for O
all O
the O
senses. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
smooth O
and O
always O
with O
a O
word O
of O
explanation. O

And O
when O
Vicky, B-TARGET
the O
hostess O
even O
has O
a O

she O
comes O
with O
the O
charm O
of O
Indian O
hospitality O
to O
check O

Refined O

The O
menu B-TARGET
Indira I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

No O
large O
quantities, O
but O
refined O
so O
with O
several O
extras. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
garden O
terrace O
and O
a O
terrace O
on O
the O

Closed O

perfect O
to O
stop O
here O
during O
a O
bike O
ride O
located O
on O
the O
waterfront, O
beautiful O
view O
and O
quiet O
good O
food B-TARGET
, O
nothing O
special O
but O
was O
not O
necessary O

Formidable! O

The O
only O
word O
that O
fits O
the O
wedding O
party O
of O
daughter O
Nathalie O
with O
son-in-law O
Stijn O
on O
August O
2, O
2014 O
in O
this O
unique O
location B-TARGET
. O

From O
the O
boat O
trip, O
offered O
to O
the O
wedding O
couple, O
through O
the O
cozy O
and O
extremely O
spontaneous O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
to O
the O
super O
delicious O
meals B-TARGET
and O
the O
happy O
faces O
of O
family O
and O
friends O
to O
the O
fantastic O
wedding O
cake! O

And O
all O
this O
under O
a O
bright O
sunshine: O
a O
day O
never O
to O
forget... O
and O
a O
must O
for O
everyone! O

We O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
few O
times O
in O
the O
past O
2 O
years O
and O
each O
time O
we O
find O
the O
food B-TARGET
tasty O
but O
nothing O
special. O

What O
we O
also O
noticed O
is O
that O
the O
menu B-TARGET
has O
hardly O
changed O
in O
this O
time, O
which O
I O
personally O
find O
regrettable. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
okay O
depending O
on O
who/when/.... O
Some O
are O
friendlier O
than O
others. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
really O
nice O
if O
you O
sit O
outside O
and O
inside O
it O
is O
cozy. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Gwen O
and O
Philippe's B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
a O
few O
times O
now O
and O
always O
left O
with O
a O
smile. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
food B-TARGET
delicious, O
but O
also O
their O
staff B-TARGET
deserves O
a O
big O
compliment! O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
situated O
at O
the O
Moervaart, O
which O
makes O
your O
visit O
even O
more O
cosy/romantic. O

Continue O
Keyserhof! B-TARGET

Poor O
and O
unfriendly O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
was O
downright O
bad. O

2 O
hours O
waiting O
for O
your O
food O
with O
a O
water O
sangria, B-TARGET
then O
half O
warm O
food B-TARGET
obtained. O

The O
settlement B-TARGET
was O
4.5 O
euros O
wrong O
to O
our O
disadvantage! O

Worst O
restaurant B-TARGET
(cafe) O
where O
we O
have O
ever O
been. O

Stay O
away O
from O
there O

heard O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
but O
what O
a O
disappointment, O
the O
so O
called O
everything O
self O
made O
was O
quite O
disappointing, O
rather O
a O
better O
snack O
bar O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
simply O
awful, O
long O
waits, O
wrong O
things O
on O
the O
table, O
can O
not O
handle O
the O
pressure O
and O
service O
clearly O
and O
let O
this O
very O
clearly O
show O
to O
the O
customers O
also, O
big O
disappointment O

Again O
we O
went O
to O
our O
favourite O
tapas B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
in O
Herentals. O

To O
our O
surprise O
new O
owners O
and O
not O
as O
cozy O
dark O
as O
before O
in O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
bar. I-TARGET

The O
new O
owners O
come O
directly O
from O
Spain O
so O
we O
were O
full O
of O
expectations O
for O
extra O
delicious O
tapas O
but O
unfortunately O
the O
prawns B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
garlic I-TARGET
were O
served O
lukewarm O
and O
not O
nice O
and O
spicy O
as O
it O
should O
be O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
also O
lukewarm. O

What O
a O
pity O
but O
I O
said O
something O
and O
ordered O
2 O
new O
portions B-TARGET
but O
then O
hot O
and O
that O
was O
tasty. O

But O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
no O
longer O
there, O
apparently O
left O
with O
the O
previous O
owners. O

Too O
bad O
next O
time O
but O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
big O
market O
in O
Herentals O
there O
is O
also O
a O
cozy O
tapas O
bar. O

Let's O
try O
that O
one. O

cozy O
and O
simple. O

Sometimes O
you O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
current B-TARGET
owners, I-TARGET
unlike O
the O
previous O
owners, O
not O
with O
full O
"goesting" O
work. O

Everyone O
is O
friendly, O
but O
a O
smile O
is O
difficult. O

Soit, O
they O
do O
their O
best. O

Delicious O
food O
in O
the O
romantic O
garden B-TARGET
by O
the O
water O
with O
the O
fish. O

Prawns B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
Indian O
way O
is O
super O
delicious.... O

Service B-TARGET
is O
always O
friendly O
and O
fast. O

The O
food B-TARGET
takes O
a O
little O
long O
but O
worth O
the O
wait O
because O
t O
is O
delicious O
and O
nice O
and O
fresh. O

Lunch O
is O
faster O
than O
dinner. O

In O
short O
the B-TARGET
wild I-TARGET
vespers I-TARGET
is O
our O
favorite O
here O
in O
Herentals. O

See O
you O
soon O
again! O

Greetings O

The O
Dutchmen O

Nice O
and O
cozy O
terrace, B-TARGET
good O
food, B-TARGET
salads, O
pastas, O
meat, O
fish, O
something O
for O
everyone. O

And O
very O
tasty O
desserts. B-TARGET

Also O
inside B-TARGET
it O
is O
cozy, O
but O
outside B-TARGET
in O
the O
summer O
is O
really O
super. O

The O
Wild O
Vespers O
has O
a O
tasteful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
a O
beautiful O
garden B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pond I-TARGET
. O

Here, O
when O
the O
weather O
is O
nice, O
many O
people O
can O
enjoy O
while O
eating. O

or O
just O
classic O
-for O
a O
good O
quick O
lunch B-TARGET
you O
can O
always O
come O
here. O

The O
arrangement B-TARGET
of O
the O
tables O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
little O
strange, O
unsociable. O

Not O
suitable O
for O
hosting O
a O
pleasant O
meal. O

Sunday O
evening... O
and O
apparently O
the O
staff B-TARGET
find O
it O
normal O
that O
there O
is O
hardly O
anything O
in O
stock O
then. O

The O
tortillas B-TARGET
that O
are O
normally O
served O
as O
appetizers O
beforehand O
-out O
of O
stock. O

No O
excuses, O
just O
-'they're O
out'. O

Beer B-TARGET
, O
various O
dishes B-TARGET
-on. O

Finally, O
when O
I O
respond O
that O
this O
is O
rather O
strange, O
I O
just O
get O
the O
answer: O
it's O
Sunday O
night, O
that's O
normal O
after O
a O
busy O
weekend. O

At O
chi O
chi's O
I O
don't O
expect O
culinary O
delights, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
should O
at O
least O
be O
correct O
and O
polite. O

A O
while O
ago O
I O
went O
to O
eat O
at O
't O
Backhuys O
in O
Tessenderlo. O

At O
25¬∞ O
C O
it O
was O
nice O
to O
eat O
on O
a O
beautiful O
terrace, B-TARGET
what O
could O
be O
nicer. O

I O
ordered O
a O
steppes O
steak O
and O
the O
steppes O
sauce. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
for O
our O
food. O

The O
steppe B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
and O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

But O
the O
steak B-TARGET
was O
completely O
cooked O
through O
and O
like O
a O
shoe O
sole. O

My O
friend's O
chicken B-TARGET
breast I-TARGET
was O
well O
cooked O
and O
nice O
and O
juicy O
though. O

Too O
bad O
about O
the O
meat B-TARGET
and O
the O
long O
wait, O
but O
deserves O
a O
second O
chance O
because O
of O
the O
cozy O
location. B-TARGET

A O
nice O
reception B-TARGET
, O
a O
nice O
location B-TARGET
, O
The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
well O
done O
and O
a O
decent O
portion! O

Highly O
recommended O
for O
a O
pleasant O
evening! O

We O
were O
still O
talking O
with O
a O
drink O
this O
was O
no O
problem, O
we O
were O
not O
put O
outside! O

in O

completely O

2 O

We O
stayed O
in O

we O
were O
in O
a O
super O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O

was O
excellent O
and O
the O

super O
sweet. O

We O

For O
connoisseurs O
and O
people O
who O
want O
something O
else O
than O
mussels O
and O
fries. O

Let O
us O
surprise O
you! O

A O
bit O
startled O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
was O
only O
one O
menu, B-TARGET
but O
oh O
so O
delicious O
food O
and O
drink. O

If O
you O
would O
like O
something O
different, O
this O
is O
negotiable. O

2 O
People B-TARGET
who O
know O
their O
trade O
extremely O
well, O
are O
very O
hospitable O
and O
if O
the O
service O
allows, O
like O
to O
have O
a O
chat O
with O
their O
guests. O

We O
are O
happy O
to O
have O
discovered O
this O
nice O
address B-TARGET
and O
will O
definitely O
go O
back! O

They O
had O
simply O
forgotten O
about O
us. O

Pork B-TARGET
tenderloin I-TARGET
almost O
raw O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
stew I-TARGET
you O
had O
to O
look O
for. O

Very O
unfriendly O
as O
if O
they O
don't O
like O
you O
coming O
to O
eat O
something. O

Worthless O

This O
afternoon O
we O
had O
dinner O
at O
Den O
Cleynen O
Keyser. O

Staff B-TARGET
unfriendly, O
even O
2 O
times O
asked O
for O
card. O

Order O
came O
after O
one O
and O
a O
half O
hours! O

1x O
fetuccine B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
curry, I-TARGET
really O
bad O
we O
have O
left, O
2x O
grilled B-TARGET
scampi I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
garlic I-TARGET
butter, I-TARGET
this O
was O
served O
in O
a O
tasteless O
sauce B-TARGET
not O
in O
garlic O
butter, O
ready-made O
lifelafje. B-TARGET

Next O
to O
it O
a O
steak O
with O
pepper O
cream O
sauce, O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
reasonable O
steak B-TARGET
again O
bland. O

Wine B-TARGET
from O
tap, O
also O
disgusting, O
no O
other O
wine B-TARGET
to O
order! O

The O
waitress, B-TARGET
I O
think O
daughter, O
three O
times O
asked O
for O
the O
free O
access O
code O
of O
the O
wifi O
network, O
she O
could O
not O
remember O
(!) O
So O
I O
did O
not O
get O
it? O

Then O
you O
should O
not O
offer O
it! O

Then O
at O
the O
checkout O
(Euro O
100,--) O
was O
not O
asked O
by O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
, O
if O
it O
had O
tasted O
us, O
that O
was O
obvious O
because O
the O
plates O
were O
not O
empty. O

Then O
came O
the O
owner B-TARGET
who O
asked O
if O
it O
had O
tasted, O
I O
clearly O
indicated O
that O
it O
was O
not O
good. O

Mister B-TARGET
walked O
away O
to O
then O
not O
look O
at O
me O
anymore, O
and O
not O
do O
anything O
else O
with O
my O
answer. O

My O
advice, O
go O
eat O
somewhere O
else. O

Worthless... O
