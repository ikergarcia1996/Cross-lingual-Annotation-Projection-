Long O
waiting B-TARGET
period. I-TARGET

Same O
dessert, B-TARGET
two O
days O
after O
each O
other. O

Breakfast B-TARGET
buffet I-TARGET
was O
tip O
top O
okay. O

Not O
cheap! O

We'd O
been O
told O
we O
had O
to O
be O
here O
for O
Wagye O
beef. O

Our O
GPS O
wasn't O
the O
best O
travel O
leader O
to O
get O
to O
Altembrouck O
Castle. O

But O
once O
it O
arrived O
at O
the O
castle B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
it O
became O
a O
party. O

First O
of O
all O
the O
operation, B-TARGET
exceptionally O
friendly O
thoughtful O
not O
forced O
but O
real. O

Rarely O
experienced, O
among O
the O
staff B-TARGET
there O
was O
a O
wonderful O
teasing O
chemistry. O

You O
have O
the O
choice O
between O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
menus. B-TARGET

Specialization O
is O
the O
Wagye O
cattle. O

If O
you O
ask O
about O
this O
delicious O
beef B-TARGET
the O
meat O
is O
introduced O
to O
you O
in O
advance O
on O
a O
plate. O

It's O
not O
cheap, O
but O
it's O
exceptionally O
good. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
a O
steak O
lover O
there O
is O
a O
fish O
alternative, B-TARGET
duck B-TARGET
and O
lamb B-TARGET
at O
acceptable O
prices. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
a O
good O
selection O
of O
tasty O
quality O
wines. B-TARGET

It's O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
we've O
eaten O
so O
well. O

On O
the O
border O
between O
the O
Netherlands O
and O
Belgium O
we O
have O
eaten O
exceptionally O
well O
in O
an O
atmospheric O
environment B-TARGET
with O
a O
live O
band O
that O
found O
the O
right O
tone O
and O
gave O
us O
a O
delicious O
afternoon. O

This O
is O
the O
third O
time O
we've O
eaten O
here. O

It's O
a O
fantastic O
opportunity. B-TARGET

In O
good O
weather O
outside O
in O
the O
courtyard O
or O
at O
the O
pond O
something O
to O
eat O
or O
drink. O

On O
the O
Altembrouck O
estate O
they O
work O
with O
fresh O
honest O
products. B-TARGET

They O
have O
majalica O
(curly O
hair) O
pigs O
and O
wagyu O
cattle. O

There O
is O
no O
menu. B-TARGET

On O
Sunday O
there O
is O
a O
3 B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
for O
27.50 O
which O
is O
real O
price O
quality. O

Disadvantage O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
menu B-TARGET
even O
daily. O

If O
the O
host O
has O
mentioned O
what O
there O
is O
to O
eat, O
you O
will O
be O
lost O
before O
he O
or O
she O
at O
dessert O
what O
the O
main O
course O
is. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
correct O
without O
being O
stiff. O

Too O
bad O
only O
from O
the O
last O
time O
both O
pigs O
and O
beef O
were O
mentioned O
as O
main O
course O
and O
our O
whole O
table O
found O
it O
strange O
that O
we O
were O
not O
asked O
what O
we O
preferred. O

Questioning O
learned O
that O
the O
cattle O
was O
unfortunately O
already O
sold O
out. O

Furthermore, O
and O
very O
flexible O
3 O
pers O
wanted O
to O
(with O
additional O
payment) O
go O
for O
the O
appetizer O
of O
the O
Easter O
menu. O

That O
all O
went. O

Still, O
it O
would O
be O
highly O
recommended O
to O
at O
least O
put O
something O
like O
an O
Easter O
menu O
on O
the O
website. O

Now O
you O
have O
to O
call O
or O
email O
after O
it, O
that's O
not O
very O
commercial. O

There's O
nothing O
left O
for O
praise. O

So O
wonderfully O
imaginatively O
served O
food B-TARGET
in O
a O
fine O
ambiance. B-TARGET

I O
can O
only O
recommend O
this. O

You O
come O
here O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
or O
a O
salad... O
fine, O
too. O

Just O
do O
it O
one O
time O
and O
be O
surprised. O

Too O
bad, O
such O
a O
business, B-TARGET
beautifully O
located, O
good O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
the O
friendliness O
of O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
shame O
and O
unprofessional, O

We O
had O
a O
Swiss O
guest O
at O
our O
house. O

He O
was O
pleased O
to O
be O
surprised O
by O
the O
tour O
he O
received O
in O
Halle. O

All O
in O
all, O
Cardijn O
spent O
his O
youth O
in O
Halle, O
the O
beautiful O
Saint O
Martin's O
Basilicas. O

He O
knew O
the O
music O
of O
Servais O
but O
did O
not O
know O
that O
it O
still O
smelled O
from O
Servais O
here. O

The O
idea O
to O
end O
this O
beautiful O
evening O
with O
a O
dinner O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
" O
't B-TARGET
Groot I-TARGET
Café" I-TARGET
was O
a O
real O
turnoff O
of O
your O
wealth. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
just O
fired, O
I O
thought. O

So O
unfriendly O
towards O
the O
peasantry. O

Apparently O
he O
still O
works O
there.Sympathetic O
he O
certainly O
didn't O
get O
on O
it. O

The O
food B-TARGET
didn't O
really O
participate O
much O
either O
or O
the O
service B-TARGET
played O
a O
role O
here. O

As O
long O
as O
that O
waiter B-TARGET
stays O
working O
there, O
he O
won't O
see O
me. O

We O
came O
with O
9 O
people O
for O
a O
bite O
to O
eat. O

What O
a O
terrible O
experience. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
downright O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
in O
his O
power O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
he O
didn't O
want O
to O
serve O
us. O

When O
we O
said: O
yes, O
if O
it O
is O
too O
difficult O
to O
serve O
us, O
we O
could O
not O
finish O
our O
sentence O
but O
were O
shouted O
by O
the O
ear O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
then O
turned O
around O
and O
left. O

The O
other O
customers O
said O
out O
loud O
that O
it O
was O
outrageous O
and O
incredible O
that O
a O
group O
of O
9 O
people O
were O
so O
clearly O
chased O
out! O

Any O
other O
restaurant O
with O
any O
dignity O
would O
receive O
9 O
customers O
at O
19.20 O
on O
Saturday O
night O
with O
open O
arms! O

If O
this O
case B-TARGET
can't O
survive, O
it's O
not O
the O
crisis! O

Owner, O
teach O
your O
staff B-TARGET
manners. O

We O
come O
here O
more O
often: O
decent O
brasserie B-TARGET
without O
question. O

Everything's O
okay, O
but O
you O
never O
get O
a O
real O
"wow" O
feeling. O

Case O
clearly O
runs O
on O
(parent) O
clientele O
and O
is O
satisfied O
with O
this. O

In O
short: O
you O
will O
never O
be O
disappointed O
but O
you O
will O
never O
be O
in O
the O
'clouds'. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
received O
from O
us O
the O
free O
choice O
of O
paper B-TARGET
courts, I-TARGET
she O
delivered O
quickly O
and O
although O
everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
good O
quality, O
I O
missed O
sophistication. O

We O
told O
at O
the O
beginning O
to O
keep O
the O
combination O
of O
tapa O
and O
fish O
and O
this O
was O
not O
discussed O
at O
all: O
iberico, B-TARGET
chorizo, B-TARGET
manchego, B-TARGET
Russian B-TARGET
egg, I-TARGET
mushrooms, B-TARGET
tomatoes...., B-TARGET
meatballs B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
all O
delicious, O
but O
not O
authentic... O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
most O
expensive O
bottle O
at O
the O
most O
fashionable O
price O
of O
30 O
eur..... O

So O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
address B-TARGET
for O
cozy O
chat O
and O
simple O
yet O
tasty O
tapàs B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
friendly O
but O
in O
a O
hurry... O

Southern O
atmosphere... B-TARGET

Cozy O
and O
tasty. O

Great O
concept B-TARGET
for O
a O
great O
evening O
in O
Spanish O
decor!! O

Be O
sure O
to O
come O
back. O

Beautiful O
wines B-TARGET
and O
very O
cozy O
ambiente. B-TARGET

Authentic O
recipes B-TARGET
(as O
a O
bunch O
of O
connoisseurs O
we O
can O
confirm) O
and O
everything O
homemade O
(that's O
what O
you O
taste!). O

Recommended O
for O
a O
night O
out! O

Nice O
concept, B-TARGET
very O
tasty O
wines B-TARGET
and O
tapas, B-TARGET
these O
change O
regularly O
sometimes O
very O
good O
others O
just O
right. O

always O
come O
back O
to O
spend O
a O
cozy O
evening O
with O
snack O
and O
drink, O
the O
service B-TARGET
might O
be O
faster O
sometimes, O
but O
consider O
this O
as O
a O
fun O
and O
relaxing O
afternoon O
or O
evening O
without O
stress O

Antwerp O
metropolis O
is O
a O
fantastic O
city O
for O
gastronomes. O

Also O
in O
the O
periphery O
there O
are O
gems O
such O
as O
Klein B-TARGET
Constantia. I-TARGET

Although O
rather O
focused O
on O
a O
fashionable O
audience O
who O
likes O
to O
eat O
a O
steak, O
this O
restaurant O
presents O
with O
the O
regularity O
of O
the O
clock O
taste O
paradise O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
gastronomes. O

And O
for O
amateurs O
of O
South O
African O
wines O
with O
a O
fruity O
taste, O
try O
Provenance O
Rooi. O

Just O
the O
best O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
neighborhood! O

Passion O
for O
food O
and O
matching O
drinks O
in O
a O
cozy O
setting. O

Different O
but O
oh O
so O
tasty!!!! O

Previous O
visits O
to O
KC B-TARGET
were O
always O
a O
culinary O
highlight. O

Unfortunately, O
that O
from O
the O
last O
visit O
can O
no O
longer O
be O
said. O

Apparently O
the O
swung's O
out. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
far O
too O
limited, O
suggestions B-TARGET
are O
gone, O
just O
like O
the O
creativity O
on O
the O
board. B-TARGET

A O
simple O
salad B-TARGET
as O
a O
side O
dish O
is O
not O
my O
immediate O
motivation O
to O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant. O

Amuses B-TARGET
that O
used O
to O
be O
a O
nice O
entrance O
are O
now O
limited O
to O
a O
pumpkin O
soup. O

But O
even O
with O
this O
limited O
card B-TARGET
(4 O
main O
dishes, O
4 O
appetizers O
and O
2 O
desserts) O
there O
were O
still O
2 O
dishes O
not O
available! O

But O
very O
annoying, O
this O
was O
not O
reported O
in O
advance O
at O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
menu. O

Even O
this O
was O
reported O
to O
the O
main O
course O
only O
when O
it O
had O
to O
be O
served! O

Here's O
the O
card. O
Choose O
something O
else. O

No, O
these O
are O
3 O
steps O
backwards O
from O
previous O
visits. O

If O
it's O
the O
owner's O
choice O
to O
go O
for O
a O
brasserie, O
that's O
his O
choice, O
but O
as O
we're O
betting O
on O
2 O
horses O
now, O
it O
just O
doesn't O
work. O

Too O
bad. O

On O
the O
positive O
side, O
however, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
is O
ok O
and O
the O
wide O
choice O
of O
South B-TARGET
African I-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

We're O
gonna O
have O
dinner O
for O
the O
second O
time. O

Previously O
on O
Royal O
All O
in O
menu, O
this O
time O
the O
all O
in O
menu. O

Tip O
top O
okay O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
cava O
with O
waiting O
plate, O
appetizer, O
main O
dish O
and O
dessert O
or O
irish O
coffee. O

Water O
and O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine O
included O
for O
32€. O

Very O
friendly O
and O
smooth O
operation. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended! O

In O
the O
previous O
establishment O
was O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
service O
at O
restaurant O
level. O

Now O
it's O
not O
worth O
a O
brasserie O
review. O

Dinner O
with O
family O
(6 O
persons) O
was O
really O
disappointing. O

Delicious O
sandwich B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
full-au-vent I-TARGET
To O
8.5€! O

Expensive. O

Service B-TARGET
wasn't O
friendly. O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
ok O
but O
not O
so O
pleasant O

The B-TARGET
Village, I-TARGET
highly O
recommended! O

Cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
TOP! O

Romance O
or O
cosiness, O
enjoy O
yourself,...alaise!! O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work! O

I O
used O
to O
eat O
regularly O
at O
the O
southern O
pearl, O
now O
the O
concept O
has O
changed O
to O
a O
diner O
which O
also O
means O
that O
the O
map O
has O
been O
completely O
adapted. O

But O
to O
be O
honest, O
it O
was O
and O
stays O
here O
top O
to O
eat. O

Beautiful O
decoration O
of O
the O
business, B-TARGET
super O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
something O
for O
everyone O
on O
the O
map. B-TARGET

What O
I O
like O
to O
do O
here O
is O
the O
Tapas B-TARGET
dish, I-TARGET
but O
also O
their O
village B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
matching I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
their O
mussels B-TARGET
and O
the O
legendary O
Pelt B-TARGET
stew I-TARGET
is O
super O
tasty. O

Also O
the O
cosiness O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
sofa O
or O
hang O
by O
the O
bar O
and O
enjoy O
a O
nice O
Cocktail, B-TARGET
it's O
all O
here. O

Tanja, B-TARGET
you're O
doing O
well!!!!! O

We O
wanted O
to O
book O
with O
four O
people O
for O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
former O
southern O
pearl O
(phone O
didn't O
work O
several O
times)!!!!! O

Or O
they O
just O
didn't O
pick O
up. O

We O
went O
to O
action O
and O
still O
left O
boldly O
in O
hope O
that O
there O
was O
still O
room!! O

And O
yes O
there O
was O
certainly O
room O
(3 O
hours O
with O
four O
people O
in O
the O
case) O
we O
were O
very O
well O
received O
the O
garcon B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
therefore O
the O
only O
liable O
in O
the O
case! O

The O
case B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
cool O
because O
there O
was O
no O
people O
to O
stay: O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
just O
CHILD!!!! O

Saving B-TARGET
the O
aldi O
quality O
was O
bad O
and O
the O
dressing B-TARGET
was O
already O
exactly O
month O
by O
date! O

The O
home-cooked B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
came O
from O
the O
makro!!!! O

Was O
a O
female B-TARGET
employee I-TARGET
just O
smoking O
in O
the O
case? B-TARGET
This O
is O
all O
a O
pity O
and O
we O
Wker O
cannot O
repeat O
it. O

but O
highly O
recommended O
should O
you O
like O
your O
privacy!!!! O

Both O
the O
concept B-TARGET
and O
the O
Interior B-TARGET
is O
original. O

Bart O
the O
owner O
does O
the O
hall O
and O
1 O
chef O
makes O
the O
dishes. O

Therefore O
small O
card B-TARGET
with O
only O
super O
fresh O
plates. B-TARGET

The O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
is O
fantastic O
and O
price O
quality O
is O
very O
correct. O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
friendly O
reception, B-TARGET
the O
best O
steak B-TARGET
tartare I-TARGET
we've O
ever O
eaten O
(the O
baked B-TARGET
one O
should O
try O
too!), O
wine B-TARGET
adapted O
to O
your O
own O
taste,... O

In O
short, O
an O
absolute O
ATTENDANT!! O

Great O
restaurant B-TARGET
outside O
the O
real O
center O
of O
Antwerp. O

Sublime, O
casual O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
little O
couverts B-TARGET
(reservation O
is O
necessary) O
and O
fantastic O
operation. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
top O
(that O
steak B-TARGET
tartar!) I-TARGET
and O
it O
is O
wonderful O
to O
be O
surprised O
by O
their O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine. I-TARGET

Not O
a O
cheap O
business, B-TARGET
but O
price/quality O
very O
correct. O

Highly O
recommended! O

Stopped O
for O
coffee O
in O
the O
afternoon. O

And O
yes, O
on O
the O
Antwerp O
South, O
hip O
is O
not O
always O
equal O
to O
quality. O

The O
coffees B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
were O
in O
my O
opinion O
far O
too O
expensive O
and O
were O
served O
too O
cold. O

Lazy O
coffee B-TARGET
is O
just O
not O
acceptable. O

This O
is O
not O
acceptable, O
especially O
because O
the O
matter O
was O
virtually O
empty. O

Doesn't O
give O
a O
good O
impression O
that O
your O
counter O
is O
full O
of O
dishes O
from O
the O
last O
few O
hours O
while O
there O
are O
about O
8 O
people O
present O
in O
the O
store. O

They O
won't O
see O
me O
here O
anymore. O

Portie O
cake B-TARGET
was O
large O
enough O
and O
it O
was O
not O
easy O
to O
notice. O

Only O
address O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
delicious O
pastrami B-TARGET
is O
served O
with O
a O
special O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
on O
thick O
slices O
of O
bread. B-TARGET

The O
coffee B-TARGET
is O
also O
delicious O
and O
there O
is O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Nice O
to O
have O
lunch. O

Delicious O
food O
at O
caffe O
internazionale. O

After O
checking O
out O
at O
the O
hotel O
we O
went O
to O
the O
cozy O
cafe. B-TARGET

Here O
we O
had O
extensive O
breakfast O
and O
enjoyed O
a O
good O
cup O
of O
coffee. B-TARGET

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
just O
like O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
as O
if O
you O
were O
at O
friends' O
house O
oh O
visit. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
correct. O

Highly O
recommended O
for O
delicious O
breakfast, O
brunch O
and/or O
coffee! O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
à I-TARGET
L'infintise I-TARGET
is O
a O
unique O
experience O
throughout O
Antwerp. O

For O
a O
reasonable O
price, O
the O
chef O
serves O
us O
his O
culinary B-TARGET
creations I-TARGET
where O
his O
personal O
style O
comes O
into O
his O
own. O

Marc B-TARGET
is O
an O
artist O
who O
knows O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
tastes O
and O
appearance O
of O
good O
food. B-TARGET

You O
fall O
from O
one O
surprise O
to O
another. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
is O
very O
original. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
very O
creative, O
good, O
I O
have O
no O
words O
for O
it. O

Friendly O
service. B-TARGET

I'd O
love O
to O
come O
back O
here. O

Too O
bad O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
times I-TARGET
are O
so O
long. O

We've O
already O
reserved O
for O
December. O

For O
me, O
the O
chef B-TARGET
deserves O
four O
stars. O

Nicely O
furnished, O
enough O
choice, B-TARGET
good O
value O
for O
money. O

We O
fell O
in O
around O
9:00 O
p.m., O
so O
there O
wasn't O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
around. O

We O
came O
here O
yesterday O
with O
2 O
with O
a O
Grouponbon, O
menu O
with O
bottle O
of O
wine O
and O
half O
liter O
of O
water. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
cordial. O

The O
appetizer B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
so O
was O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish. I-TARGET

Several O
super O
tasty O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
rice O
separately. O

Lots O
of O
vegetables. B-TARGET

Definitely O
enough O
for O
2 O
pers. O
single O
mint: O
little O
chicken B-TARGET
and O
scampis. B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
tough O
and O
not O
fresh O
chocolate B-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

But O
you O
have O
to O
keep O
price/quality O
in O
mind... O

Control B-TARGET
SUPER O
friendly. O

I O
was O
a O
little O
scared O
after O
reading O
other O
reactions, O
I O
can O
only O
blame O
them. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
very O
extensive, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back! O

There O
would O
just O
be O
a O
new B-TARGET
owner, I-TARGET
hence O
perhaps O
the O
positive O
thing O
he O
is O
doing. O

We O
wish O
him O
every O
success! O

It's O
a O
little O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
they O
serve O
fine O
sushi B-TARGET
but O
that's O
what O
it's O
said. O

Often O
there's O
a O
special O
sauce, O
but O
you O
don't O
get O
it O
here. O

You O
get O
2 O
hours O
to O
order O
your O
5 O
rounds O
but O
within O
those O
2 O
hours O
you O
only O
get O
3 O
rounds O
because O
it O
takes O
so O
long. O

About O
30 O
minutes O
from O
order. O

In O
addition, O
there O
are O
all O
dirty O
flies O
flying O
around O
the O
bar B-TARGET
so O
I O
wouldn't O
go O
around O
there. O

The O
lady B-TARGET
was O
kind O
and O
we O
were O
even O
allowed O
to O
change O
tables O
during O
the O
crowds. O

When O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
full, O
it's O
no O
problem O
to O
eat O
your O
belly O
full O
here O
at O
a O
slow O
pace. O

But O
when O
things O
get O
a O
little O
more O
crowded, O
the O
people B-TARGET
in O
both O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
service O
are O
too O
short. O

But O
people B-TARGET
are O
trying O
to O
help O
you O
with O
the O
smile O
where O
they O
can. O

The O
tables B-TARGET
do O
not O
always O
seem O
clean, O
and O
here O
and O
there O
there O
is O
something O
to O
replace O
(like O
a O
crackling O
speaker). O

But O
it O
sounds O
worse O
than O
it O
is. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
good. O

So O
many O
different O
choices, B-TARGET
and O
the O
flavors B-TARGET
are O
good. O

The O
concept B-TARGET
in O
itself O
may O
seem O
a O
bit O
strange O
at O
first, O
and O
many O
think O
they O
will O
not O
have O
enough. O

But O
don't O
worry, O
your O
stomach's O
full O
when O
you O
leave O
the O
case. O

If O
you O
read O
that O
some O
people O
"do O
not O
dare O
to O
order O
because O
they O
may O
have O
to O
impose O
1 O
euro O
if O
they O
don't O
get O
it O
up" O
or O
have O
drunk O
"only O
water," O
then O
those O
"one-off" O
people O
of O
mine O
may O
stay O
away O
for O
a O
big O
part, O
so O
that O
the O
rest O
will O
be O
served O
more O
quickly. O

Food O
is O
perfect, O
we O
loved O
it O
and O
enjoyed O
it O
and O
we O
will O
come O
back O
one O
day O
without O
a O
doubt! O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
eat B-TARGET
so O
much, O
perfect!!!! O

Shusi's B-TARGET
are O
good O
although O
one O
should O
be O
able O
to O
decide O
for O
oneself O
whether O
there O
is O
wasabi O
and/or O
pepper O
on O
it. O

Hot B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
come O
from O
microwave O
especially O
the O
spies B-TARGET
and O
ribs B-TARGET
were O
distasteful. O

If O
you're O
a O
frequent O
shusi O
eater, O
skip O
this O
case. B-TARGET

Too O
bad O
of O
the O
expenses O
made O
without O
desert O
gone O
away O
after O
3 O
rounds. O

Attracted O
by O
the O
nice O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
the O
street O
side O
and O
the O
delicious O
cheeses B-TARGET
in O
the O
display O
case, O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
this O
case. O

No O
menu, O
but O
just O
choose O
between O
the O
delicacies O
in O
the O
cool O
tooth, O
I O
took O
a O
tortellini B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pancetta I-TARGET
adored O
by O
the O
operator, O
super O
tasty! O

This O
combined O
with O
fine O
music B-TARGET
in O
the O
background O
and O
a O
delicious O
glass O
of O
white B-TARGET
for O
a O
very O
correct O
price. O

Definitely O
try! O

The O
taste O
nation O
is O
really O
something O
else! O

Nice O
address B-TARGET
for O
lunch O
but O
also O
for O
something B-TARGET
tasty I-TARGET
to O
get O
to O
eat O
at O
home O
or O
drink O
a O
nice O
glass O
of O
wine B-TARGET
with O
n O
assortment O
of O
cheese! O

The O
owner O
does O
everything O
alone O
so O
he O
has O
his O
hands O
full! O

That O
is O
why O
prices O
are O
very O
democratic! O

Everything O
is O
prepared O
in O
an O
artisan O
way! O

Try O
one O
of O
the O
delicious O
cakes B-TARGET
or O
quiches, B-TARGET
they O
are O
to O
lick O
the O
fingers O
off! O

In O
short, O
highly O
recommended! O

The O
beautiful O
location O
(Sint B-TARGET
Jorispoort) I-TARGET
drew O
us O
to O
the O
terrace. O

But O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
beat O
everything O
here. O

It O
seemed O
like O
we O
were O
disturbing O
the O
chef, B-TARGET
although O
there O
was O
no O
one O
next O
to O
us. O

He O
therefore O
had O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
a O
particular O
court O
could O
not O
be O
obtained O
because O
he O
was O
busy. O

We O
were O
looked O
over. O

A O
look, O
a O
smile, O
a O
"tasteful" O
or O
"thank O
you" O
were O
far O
away. O

Maybe O
somewhere O
under O
a O
sour O
lemon... O

Besides, O
there O
was O
the O
bill... O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
hadn't O
asked O
for O
(5 O
euros O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine B-TARGET
we O
could O
still O
accept) O
was O
a O
5x5 O
cm O
or O
3 O
bite O
focalccia. B-TARGET

This O
was O
a O
total O
of O
8 O
euros O
each. O

As O
for O
the O
flavor, O
which O
is O
so O
tweaked, O
my O
soup B-TARGET
was O
as O
faint O
as O
in O
the O
typical O
brasserie O
kitchen. O

The O
focalccia B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
it's O
worth O
a O
fortune. O

Bon, O
wondering O
how O
long O
this O
case B-TARGET
is O
gonna O
last... O

If O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
original O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
you've O
come O
to O
the O
right O
place. O

The O
shop B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
open I-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
is O
nicely O
furnished O
and O
the O
operator B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
in O
choosing O
the O
meal. O

Every O
day O
there O
are O
freshly O
prepared O
soups, B-TARGET
light O
meal B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
quiches O
and O
there O
is O
also O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
cheeses. B-TARGET

You O
can O
eat O
on O
the O
spot O
or O
takeaway. O

I O
chose O
the O
celery-salie O
soup O
with O
honey O
from O
a O
local O
beekeeper O
and O
behind O
it O
a O
cheese O
board. O

The O
soup B-TARGET
was O
really O
great O
and O
the O
cheeses, B-TARGET
which O
the O
operator O
had O
selected, O
were O
also O
definitely O
fine. O

With O
friends O
go O
terraces O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
high O
street, O
at O
the O
pedestrian O
tunnel. O

Good O
food, O
good O
drinking, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
honest O
kitchen, B-TARGET
boss B-TARGET
--->live O
de O
Steve!! O

Nice O
little O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Decoration B-TARGET
is O
modern. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
casual O
in O
style, O
and O
friendly. O

Sometimes O
it O
takes O
you O
a O
while O
to O
get O
the O
attention O
if O
you O
want O
to O
order O
something. O

The O
tables B-TARGET
are O
as O
small O
as O
in O
so O
many O
places O
in O
Antwerp. O

The O
food, B-TARGET
however, O
was O
fine. O

Had O
some O
nice O
cheese B-TARGET
pots I-TARGET
in O
advance. O

LMain B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
stew I-TARGET
also O
delicious. O

We O
have O
something O
to O
celebrate O
and O
decide O
to O
do O
this O
at O
Sombat. O

Finally, O
this O
restaurant O
is O
number O
one O
at O
TripAdvisor O
for O
Antwerp. O

The O
expectations O
are O
thus O
high, O
and O
this O
is O
not O
always O
without O
risk. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
where O
you O
just O
walk O
in, O
pre-booking O
is O
required. O

With O
barely O
12 O
cupboards O
this O
is O
understandable. O

Upon O
arrival, O
the O
façade O
of O
this O
beautiful O
mansion O
makes O
no O
sense O
that O
behind O
it O
there O
is O
a O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
are O
friendly O
and O
with O
that O
typical O
Oriental O
courtesy O
received O
by O
Sombat. B-TARGET

The O
back O
garden B-TARGET
with O
pond O
is O
beautiful, O
unfortunately O
it O
is O
too O
cold O
outside O
and O
we O
take O
the O
aperitif O
in O
the O
leather O
salon. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
cava B-TARGET
and O
included O
in O
the O
set-menu O
price O
at O
50,00€ O
per O
person. O

In O
the O
meantime, O
we're O
sampling O
the O
interior. O

That O
is O
beautiful, O
soothing O
and O
exudes O
an O
authentic O
Thai O
setting. O

It O
has O
more O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
a O
living O
room O
than O
of O
a O
formal O
restaurant. O

The O
whole B-TARGET
offers O
a O
high O
living O
room O
feeling, O
it O
is O
cozy O
sitting O
here. O

We O
are O
placed O
at O
a O
table O
of O
4 O
with O
an O
unusual O
but O
nice O
shape. O

Anyone O
can O
talk O
to O
anyone O
without O
any O
problems. O

Here O
we O
go. O

The O
2 O
snacks B-TARGET
in O
advance O
are O
fresh O
and O
very O
tasty O
in O
taste. O

The O
host O
Sombat O
tells O
us O
that O
tonight's O
menu O
includes O
5 O
courses. O

We O
start O
with O
"Chicken O
soup O
with O
coconut, O
galanka, O
lemongrass, O
time, O
chili O
and O
coriandre." O

This O
is O
a O
rather O
spicy O
soup, B-TARGET
acceptable O
seasoned O
and O
subtle O
in O
taste. O

Then O
there O
will O
be O
"spicy O
seafood O
salad O
with O
vermicelli O
and O
repeat." O

This O
dish B-TARGET
is O
the O
better O
job. O

We O
continue O
with O
"chicken O
and O
vegetable O
wrapped O
in O
rice O
paper, O
sweet O
and O
sour O
sauce." O

Very O
well O
prepared. O

The O
parade O
of O
appetizers O
ends O
with O
deep-fried O
shrimps O
with O
curry O
served O
with O
cucumber O
sauce. O

There O
is O
nothing O
to O
note O
here O
either. O

The O
main O
course O
comes O
with O
"grilled O
scottish O
beef O
served O
with O
soy O
sauce O
and O
chilli O
powder, O
seafood O
sauce O
with O
chilli O
and O
basil, O
sauthé O
of O
fish O
filet O
with O
coconut O
in O
banana O
leaves O
and O
fresh O
vegetables O
with O
sésame O
oil." O

This O
is O
where O
things O
go O
wrong. O

The O
amount B-TARGET
of O
food O
is O
too O
large, O
and O
with O
waste O
of O
food O
I O
always O
have O
a O
problem. O

The O
harmony O
in O
structure O
and O
taste O
expression O
between O
the O
(too) O
numerous O
ingredients B-TARGET
is O
also O
completely O
out O
of O
control. O

Too O
bad, O
but O
this O
court B-TARGET
didn't O
succeed. O

We'll O
have O
a O
white O
Pouilly O
Fuissé O
and O
a O
red O
Sancere. O

They O
are O
both O
excellent O
and O
priced O
with O
moderation. O

We O
finish O
with O
an O
ice B-TARGET
composition I-TARGET
that O
is O
very O
tasty. O

At O
the O
coffee O
is O
offered O
promptly O
cognac O
of O
the O
house, O
very O
attentive. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
thoughtful O
and O
polite, O
albeit O
timid. O

This O
'Home B-TARGET
Cooking' I-TARGET
concept I-TARGET
is O
something O
other O
than O
a O
formal O
restaurant. O

The O
ingredients B-TARGET
used O
are O
fresh O
and O
in O
themselves O
tastefully O
prepared. O

But O
the O
harmony B-TARGET
isn't O
always O
right O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
too O
large. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
better O
Thai B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
like O
no O
refined O
gastronomy. O

What, O
however, O
will O
not O
stop O
me O
from O
coming O
here O
on O
occasion? O

After O
reading O
the O
numerous O
positive O
comments O
made O
a O
last O
minute O
reservation. O

Hospitality B-TARGET
top, O
environment B-TARGET
inside O
and O
outside O
to O
unwind O
completely O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
to O
dream O
away O
from. O

Our O
discovery O
of O
the O
year. O

Satisfied O
in O
all O
respects O

When O
you O
come O
in, O
you O
feel O
right O
in O
Thailand. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
stylish O
and O
cozy, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
garden B-TARGET
where O
we O
used O
the O
aperitif. O

The O
food B-TARGET
(4 O
courses O
menu O
for O
50€) O
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
not O
too O
"spicy." O

The O
host B-TARGET
and O
his O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
considerate O
and O
friendly. O

Sombat B-TARGET
Thai I-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
highly O
recommended O
and O
we O
are O
definitely O
going O
back. O

We O
enjoyed O
an O
excellent O
lunch B-TARGET
with O
a O
super O
tasty O
dessert. B-TARGET

The O
custom B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
very O
friendly O
and O
we O
were O
lucky O
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
the O
courtyard. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended. O

Don't O
let O
the O
crowded O
environment B-TARGET
scare O
you O
off. O

We O
had O
chosen O
a O
4-course O
menu. O

Since O
I O
am O
not O
allowed O
to O
eat O
mussels O
this O
was O
easily O
replaced O
by O
another O
dish. O

I O
asked O
the O
sommelier O
what O
wine O
he O
proposed O
from O
around O
50€. O

This O
was O
at O
the O
cheapest O
one O
on O
the O
map. O

Either O
that O
one, O
or O
the O
other O
one, O
but O
I O
also O
have O
a O
Barbera O
of O
36€. O

Then O
why O
wasn't O
it O
on O
the O
map? O

The O
amuses B-TARGET
and O
also O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
had O
a O
refined O
taste. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
weren't O
very O
large. O

But O
when O
I O
got O
the O
Irish B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
presented O
my O
4 O
pieces O
(7x2 O
cm) O
were O
full O
of O
tendons O
where O
one O
could O
not O
cut O
oneself O
with O
a O
knife. O

I O
was O
advertising O
at O
the O
garçon. O

And O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
the O
chef B-TARGET
came O
up O
with O
4 O
delicious O
pieces O
of O
meat. B-TARGET

It O
couldn't O
have O
been O
that O
he O
hadn't O
seen O
that O
with O
the O
dressing O

The O

also O
excellent O

Again O
a O
pleasant O

Nice O

love O
this! O

High O

but O
with O
style. O

The O
address B-TARGET
for O
that O
one O
special O
occasion, O
together O
enjoy O
and O
be O
spoiled. O

The O
location B-TARGET
on O
a O
busy O
stone O
road O
is O
a O
turnoff, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
also O
not O
recommended. O

But O
the O
Indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is O
very O
tasty O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
incredibly O
friendly. O

Communication O
with O
the O
customer O
is O
important O
and O
your O
satisfaction O
is O
really O
their O
concern. O

That's O
why O
I O
always O
like O
to... O

Good O

Price O

Also O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
cheap. O

It O
is O
located O
on O
the O
shopping O
street O
so O
also O
very O
convenient O
while O
shopping. O

Just O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
it's O
very O
crowded O
around O
noon. O

Here O
you O
have O
a O
spacious O
paste O
of O

for O
a O
fair O

The O
pancakes B-TARGET
are O
definitely O
recommended! O

There's O
a O
lot O

We O
had O
already O
been O

last O

Now O
we've O

This O

the O

Swiss B-TARGET
diner I-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
eat O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
top, O
the O

friendly O
and O
the O

cozy! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
fine. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
too O
expensive. O

Little O
food B-TARGET
compared O
to O
what O
you O
pay. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
came O
from O
the O
freezer O
and O
had O
little O
taste. O

The O
fish O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
fluffy O
and O
salty. O

23.90 O
euros O
I O
personally O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
for O
4 O
small O
tongue B-TARGET
rolls, I-TARGET
salty O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
mashed O
potatoes. O

22.80 O
euros O
for O
a O
fish B-TARGET
brochette I-TARGET
with O
2 O
dry O
pieces O
of O
cod B-TARGET
and O
2 O
dry O
pieces O
of O
salmon B-TARGET
I O
also O
find O
quite O
expensive O
and O
simple. O

Simple O
adjustments O
to O
the O
dishes O
would O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
difference. O

I O
like O
spending O
money O
on O
fresh O
food. O

But O
this O
wasn't O
worthy O
of O
his O
money. O

I O
can O
do O
better O
than O
that. O

On O
our O
arrival O
we O
were O
handled O
by O
the O
owner, B-TARGET
to O
our O
surprise, O
in O
an O
incredibly O
verbal O
way. O

We O
could O
hardly O
take O
our O
place. O

Then O
he O
has O
once O
again O
spoken O
to O
us O
excessively O
and O
rudely O
so O
that O
we O
have O
not O
even O
gone O
over O
the O
menu. O

We O
left O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
immediately O
to O
never O
come O
back. O

Hopefully O
not O
all O
customers O
will O
be O
dealt O
with O
that O
way O
or O
he O
can O
close O
the O
case O
within O
the O
month. O

Unfortunately, O
we O
can't O
judge O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Just O
back O
from O
a O
totally O
screwed-up O
dinner B-TARGET
at O
this O
restaurant. O

All O
previous O
negative O
comments O
are O
unfortunately O
correct! O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
actually O
a O
furnished O
café, O
where O
people O
want O
to O
drive O
in O
both O
possible O
money O
with O
a O
minimum O
of O
staff. O

There O
are O
star O
restaurants O
where O
it O
is O
cheaper O
to O
table, O
but O
where O
you O
will O
be O
treated O
with O
respect. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
thinks O
he's O
God O
the O
Father. O

Certainly O
not O
recommended, O
there O
is O
better O
for O
much O
less O
money O
to O
be O
found O
in O
Ghent. O

We O
had O
heard O
some O
good O
comments O
about O
this O
restaurant, O
so O
we O
were O
looking O
forward O
to O
a O
pleasant O
evening O
out. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
looks O
nice, O
informal O
with O
the O
wooden O
tables O
and O
chairs, O
the O
(for O
this O
restaurant O
very O
extensive) O
menu B-TARGET
written O
on O
a O
chalkboard O
and O
the O
many O
(empty) O
wine O
bottles O
displayed. O

There O
is O
an O
impressive O
collection O
of O
grand B-TARGET
crus I-TARGET
from O
Burgundy O
and O
top B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
from O
Bordeaux. O

So O
these O
are O
the O
empty O
bottles, O
one O
of O
which O
isn't O
on O
the O
map. O

Maybe O
the O
chef O
wants O
to O
create O
a O
certain O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
although O
I O
can't O
imagine O
what O
this O
must O
be. O

As O
an O
aperitif, O
I O
ordered O
a O
g&t. O

Where O
one O
usually O
gets O
a O
gin O
menu O
or O
at O
least O
an O
oral O
list O
of O
what O
is O
available O
in O
the O
ministry B-TARGET
was O
given O
the O
choice O
between O
"spiced" O
or O
"not O
spicy." O

When O
I O
asked O
if O
I O
could O
see O
a O
list, O
I O
got O
rather O
grumpy O
the O
two O
alternatives O
repeated. O

Now O
well, O
not O
everyone O
has O
the O
language O
skills O
to O
describe O
a O
distillate O
in O
extensive O
terms, O
so O
I O
finally O
got O
something O
I O
had O
chosen O
"almost O
myself" O
from O
the O
handful O
(idd, O
no O
longer) O
of O
available O
gins B-TARGET
in O
the O
chosen O
category. O

The O
apero B-TARGET
was O
well O
prepared, O
even O
on O
my O
wife's O
was O
not O
noticeable. O

An O
amuse O
wouldn't O
have O
been O
bad O
(as O
an O
addition O
to O
the O
5 O
flinters O
raw O
ham), B-TARGET
but O
soit. O

Where O
we O
have O
the O
habit O
of O
ordering O
two O
appetizers O
for O
our O
youngest O
daughter O
(11j) O
(front O
and O
main O
course O
is O
too O
much, O
so O
wasteful) O
this O
was O
refused O
here O
without O
boo O
or O
ba. O

Even O
in O
the O
Parisian O
brasseries O
we O
visit O
regularly, O
this O
is O
never O
a O
problem, O
just O
to O
sketch O
an O
analogy. O

From O
this O
point O
on, O
I O
knew O
that O
the O
night O
would O
not O
be O
what O
we O
had O
imagined O
of O
it. O

Presumably O
this O
is O
a O
form O
of O
"policy," O
but O
not O
a O
form O
of O
management O
that O
is O
still O
present O
in O
most O
restaurants O
today, O
quite O
apart O
from O
an O
establishment O
like O
this. O

So, O
probably O
an O
O.R. O
restaurant B-TARGET
if O
you O
don't O
go O
there O
with O
kids, O
and O
you O
don't O
mind O
the O
service B-TARGET
being O
rather O
cocky. O

Pricey O
though, O
which O
brings O
down O
the O
total O
value O
even O
more. O

Garcon B-TARGET
arrogant O
and O
degout, O
can't O
stand O
criticism, O
and O
a O
boss B-TARGET
(cook) O
who O
doesn't O
move O
when O
something O
goes O
wrong. O

Charged O
for O
large O
portion O
of O
gambas O
of O
€45 O
while O
we O
had O
ordered O
small!! O

Gamba's B-TARGET
were O
okay O
but O
fries B-TARGET
couldn't O
be O
eaten O
(greatly O
weak O
and O
baked O
in O
your O
frutty O
fat!!!) O

Garcon, B-TARGET
take O
a O
course O
of O
basic O
courtesy O
and O
customer O
friendliness O
instead O
of O
arrogance O
and O
rudeness, O
but O
this O
will O
be O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
education! O

For O
us O
never O
again O
to O
this O
converted O
café O
to O
so O
to O
say O
(too O
expensive) O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Been O
here O
a O
few O
times O
to O
eat O
and O
always O
the O
same O
impression: O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
not O
worth O
its O
price. O

In O
terms O
of O
wine, B-TARGET
they O
only O
have O
the O
more O
expensive O
bottles. O

And O
when O
you O
order O
a O
cheaper O
bottle, O
they O
give O
an O
unbelievably O
derogatory O
look. O

They're O
certainly O
not O
sympathetic. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
eat O
something O
small O
here, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
slow O
but O
if O
you O
are O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
this O
is O
nice. O

I O
go O
to O
the O
bakery O
every O
time O
I'm O
in O
Ghent. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
tasteful O
and O
fresh. O

Their O
bread B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
served O
as O
a O
dish O
with O
butter. O

The O
daily B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
vegetarian, O
is O
warm, O
and O
made O
of O
season O
vegetables. O

Their O
spaghetti B-TARGET
bolo I-TARGET
was O
correct, O
well O
spiced O
and O
served O
with O
cheese. O

Terrace B-TARGET
is O
quite O
pleasant. O

Control B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
slow, O
but O
friendly. O

Njam! O

Coffee O
and O
pastries. O

You O
can O
choose O
seven O
or O
eight O
different O
types O
of O
cake B-TARGET
with O
your O
coffee. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

a O
lot O
of O
choice, O
tasty O
and O
cared O
for, O
easy O
parking O
to O
find O
at O
the O
Friday B-TARGET
market. I-TARGET

The O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
wheelchair O
patients O
can't O
enter O
because O
it's O
on O
the O
first O
floor! O

Spacious O
business B-TARGET
with O
finally O
solid O
tables O
that O
fit O
everything! O

Recommended O
for O
real O
potters;) O

To O

Too O

it's O
worth. O

Go O
to O
Le O

tout O
for O

Much O
more O
cozy O
and O
better O
service/price. O

By O
chance O
ended O
up O
there, O
nice O
interior, B-TARGET
no O
long O
waiting O
time O
despite O
busy O
occupation, O
just O
crockery B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
glasses, I-TARGET
excellent O
dishes, B-TARGET
affordable. O

Be O
sure O
to O
come O
back, O
keep O
it O
that O
way! O

An O
added O
value O
for O
Ghent! O

Ribs B-TARGET
excellently O
seasoned, O
savoury O
sauces. B-TARGET

A O
suggestion: O
also O
serve O
bread O
please O
(so O
not O
only O
fries O
or O
fries, O
which O
is O
also O
good O
of O
course) O

On O
Friday O
night O
we O
board O
at O
11:05 O
p.m. O

None O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
bothers O
to O
escort O
us O
to O
a O
table O
because O
of O
overcrowded O
staff O
conversations! O

We O
choose O
a O
place O
ourselves O
and O
after O
5 O
min. O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
comes O
kindly O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
the O
kitchen O
is O
already O
closed. O

At O
least O
I O
had O
read O
on O
the O
website O
that O
this O
restaurant O
is O
open O
until O
24h. O

We've O
really O
had O
super O
delicious O
food! O

Long O
doubt O
between O
Amadeus, O
crowned O
heads O
and O
this O
one. O

Eventually, O
we O
chose O
this O
case B-TARGET
because O
it O
looked O
cozy O
and O
clean. O

We O
didn't O
regret O
this. O

First O
order O
the O
appetizer O
with O
a O
drink. O

We O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
too O
long O
for O
this, O
easy O
operation. B-TARGET

Then O
ribs O
with O
honey, O
these O
haven't O
been O
waiting O
for O
long. O

The O
ribs B-TARGET
à I-TARGET
volonté I-TARGET
were O
super O
tasty, O
crispy O
and O
not O
burnt. O

These O
were O
accompanied O
by O
rookies, O
fries O
and O
sauces. O

Everything O
was O
fine O
and O
this O
for O
a O
good O
price. O

We're O
definitely O
going O
back. O

It's O
not O
Amadeus, O
but O
it's O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
smooth O
and O
good O
and O
the O
ribs B-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty O
and O
not O
as O
fat O
as O
in O
previously O
mentioned O
case. O

We O
have O
been O
here O
several O
times O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
always O
the O
same O
thing O
that O
dares O
to O
disappoint O
somewhere O
else. O

M.i. O
highly O
recommended, O
yet O
for O
the O
chateaubriand B-TARGET
bouquetière: I-TARGET
usually O
delicious O
meat O
and O
excess O
in O
quantity, O
the O
vegetables O
swim O
in O
the O
butter O
but O
melt O
in O
your O
mouth. O

Sometimes O
it's O
a O
little O
less, O
fortunately O
mostly O
top. O

Too O
bad O
the O
wines B-TARGET
have O
recently O
been O
stored O
another O
10-15% O
(a O
modal O
2010 B-TARGET
châteauneuf I-TARGET
du I-TARGET
pape I-TARGET
now O
costs O
90 O
euros). O

It O
is O
often O
crowded O
and O
rather O
noisy, O
ask O
for O
a O
place O
at O
the O
guide O
michelins O
(max. O
3 O
p.) O
or O
in O
the O
back O
hall. O

The O
bar/lounge B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
smoker-annex I-TARGET
is O
cozy O
and O
succeeds O
in O
convincing O
people O
every O
night O
to O
stay O
stuck. O

Not O
a O
top-restaurant B-TARGET
but O
recommended, O
especially O
for O
the O
primeval O
bon-vivant O
with O
greater O
hunger. O

We O
keep O
going O
back O
there O
regularly O
with O
pleasure. O

My O
partner O
and O
I O
had O
booked O
Saturday O
(13/9/2014) O
at O
7:30 O
p.m. O

We O
had O
already O
been O
here O
several O
times O
and O
knew O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
steaks B-TARGET
is O
top. O

At O
the O
reservation O
we O
asked O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
porch, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
noted. O

Fortunately O
there O
was O
another O
table O
for O
2 O
persons O
free O
in O
the O
porch O
so O
this O
was O
ok. O

Very O
soon O
we O
got O
a O
bite O
(paste O
"Gentse O
Kop") O
and O
our O
order O
was O
taken O
by O
a O
friendly O
lady. B-TARGET

We O
also O
ordered O
a O
bottle O
of O
white O
house O
wine O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
water. O

After O
about O
ten O
minutes O
the O
wine O
and O
the O
water O
came O
on O
the O
table. O

Not O
much O
later, O
our O
appetizer O
was O
served. O

And O
then O
time O
went O
very O
slowly. O

The O
table O
was O
cleared O
and O
waiting O
for O
our O
main O
dish O
(filet O
pure: O
one O
bleu O
baked, O
the O
other O
seignant) O
could O
begin. O

I O
thought O
we O
were O
still O
quite O
patient O
because O
only O
after O
1h30 O
wait O
we O
asked O
if O
our O
food O
would O
get O
the O
same O
evening. O

In O
answer O
we O
got: O
"If O
I O
may O
be O
honest, O
I O
really O
don't O
know." O

Meanwhile O
our O
bottle O
of O
wine O
was O
already O
empty O
so O
we O
ordered O
a O
second O
bottle. O

Around O
us O
we O
also O
heard O
other O
people O
complaining O
(some O
were O
already O
2h30 O
waiting). O

When O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
steak O
at O
21h45 O
(after O
2h15 O
wait) O
the O
steak B-TARGET
(which O
had O
to O
be O
bleu O
baked) O
was O
actually O
cold. O

Our O
friendly O
lady, B-TARGET
however, O
immediately O
intervened O
and O
took O
the O
steak B-TARGET
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
after O
which O
it O
was O
served O
perfectly O
baked O
and O
warm. O

We O
had O
already O
seen O
the O
chef B-TARGET
welcome O
customers O
all O
evening O
and O
talk O
so O
we O
wanted O
to O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
(long O
waiting O
times). O

We O
asked O
our O
waitress O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
chief. O

She O
told O
us O
that O
she O
had O
asked O
him O
but O
apparently O
he O
did O
not O
bother O
to O
come O
to O
us O
and O
give O
some O
explanation. O

Apparently, O
you O
have O
to O
be O
at O
least O
B.V. O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
chief. B-TARGET

Conclusion: O
quality O
was O
top O
but O
manager B-TARGET
does O
not O
reduce O
himself O
to O
talk O
to O
ordinary O
customers, O
he O
prefers O
the O
problems O
solved O
by O
his O
staff O
rather O
than O
putting O
his O
own O
house O
in O
order. O

Very O
pathetic. O

Cool-cool-Nice! O

Especially O
order O
the O
lobster B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
six I-TARGET
different I-TARGET
sauces! I-TARGET

Unique O
framework!! O

The O
most O
exquisite O
Sunday B-TARGET
brunch I-TARGET
I've O
ever O
experienced. O

A O
beautiful O
setting B-TARGET
overlooking O
the O
lawn O
(indeed, O
Coeur O
d'Artichaut O
is O
no O
longer O
located O
in O
Underbergen, O
but O
on O
the O
Korenlei!). O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
young, O
spontaneous, O
friendly, O
and O
first O
name O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

Everything O
starts O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
exquisite O
Prosecco, B-TARGET
and O
then O
the O
actual O
buffet O
begins: O
soup, O
cold O
starters, O
with O
starters, O
a O
special O
stew O
from O
the O
chef O
(this O
time O
was O
the O
belly O
bacon O
with O
trumpets O
de O
la O
mort), O
cheese O
dish, O
sweet O
sandwiches, O
dessert, O
a O
chocolate O
fountain. O

In O
the O
meantime, O
white O
and O
red O
wine O
was O
served O
at O
the O
table, O
and O
of O
course O
coffee. O

Absolutely O
recommended! O

operation B-TARGET

A O
tiny O
authentic O
Italian B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
near O
the O
old O
market. O

There O
is O
a O
wide O
choice O
of O
pizzas, B-TARGET
both O
vegetarian, O
meat O
and O
fish. O

Try O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
whiskey, I-TARGET
highly O
recommended! O

Cozy O
restaurant, B-TARGET
pitches O
on O
small O
3 O
floors O
with O
sufficient O
space. O

Quick O
operation, B-TARGET
tasty O
pizza's B-TARGET
normal O
prices. O

Remarkable O
is O
the O
number O
of O
types O
of O
pizzas, B-TARGET
never O
seen O
elsewhere O

The O
only O
thing O
in O
Leuven O
with O
really O
real, O
with O
freshly O
made O
sorbets B-TARGET
that O
also O
contain O
effective O
fruit O
(and O
no O
flavors+sugar), O
huge O
bulbs O
and O
super O
friendly O
enthusiastic O
operation! B-TARGET

Delicious O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
in O
downtown O
Leuven. O

ladeuzeplein O
offers O
your O
beautiful O
sofas O
where O
you O
can O
enjoy O
this O
delicious O
ice B-TARGET
cream. I-TARGET

The O
bubbles B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
are O
being O
generously O
distributed! O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
quite O
small O
for O
a O
brasserie. O

It O
is O
nice, O
but O
there O
is O
hardly O
any O
bread O
at O
an O
omelette B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
bacon. I-TARGET

2 O
Small O
baked B-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
and O
a O
mini O
omelet B-TARGET
are O
actually O
a O
disappointment. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
good. O

Since O
it O
is O
a O
leffe O
cafe O
I O
expected O
an O
extensive O
range O
of O
beers, B-TARGET
but O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case. O

Mostly, O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
gardens. O

Summarized, O
fun, O
cozy O
but O
not O
a O
top. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
good O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
friendly. O

When O
your O
birthday O
is O
your O
birthday, O
you O
get O
a O
free O
glass O
of O
spumante, O
but O
you O
only O
get O
this O
after O
dinner O
rather O
than O
before O
as O
it O
should O
be O
with O
an O
aperitif. O

We O
regularly O
eat O
in O
the O
Parma, O
one O
of O
the O
classic O
Leuven O
restaurants. O

The O
kitchen O
is O
rather O
Belgian-French O
(all O
kinds O
of O
steak O
preparations) O
but O
with O
excellent O
ingredients B-TARGET
(super O
tender O
meat). B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
fast. O

Especially O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
(cote O
à O
l'os, O
chateaubriand,...) O
is O
our O
preference. O

The O
intérior B-TARGET
is O
not O
hip, O
but O
solid. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
also O
quite O
classic, O
but O
tasty. O

An O
address O
for O
lunch O
for O
a O
bite O
to O
eat. O

We've O
been O
out O
to O
dinner O
several O
times O
in O
restaurant O
Timory. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
classically O
decorated O
and O
radiates O
a O
charm. O

We O
enjoyed O
the O
monthly O
suggestion O
" O
fillet B-TARGET
pure I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
asparagus I-TARGET
"; O
classically O
prepared O
with O
respect O
for O
the O
vegetables. O

In O
addition, O
we O
appreciate O
the O
attentive O
service O
of O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

An O
address B-TARGET
in O
Leuven O
where O
we O
go O
blindly O
again. O

I O
haven't O
eaten O
a O
meal O
in O
the O
Timorese, O
but O
I've O
tasted O
the O
polar O
cups O
a O
few O
times. O

My O
favorite O
is O
the O
Emanuelle B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
bananas, I-TARGET
job I-TARGET
liqueur I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

Also O
the O
Na-aper B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vanilla, I-TARGET
chocomousse, I-TARGET
banana I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
lawyer I-TARGET
is O
very O
tasty. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
smooth O
and O
friendly O
and O
there O
is O
often O
a O
cozy O
hustle O
and O
bustle. O

Prices O
are O
good. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
on O
the O
Markt O
(the O
large O
square), O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
here O
because O
we O
already O
assumed O
that O
the O
quality O
would O
not O
be O
too O
good, O
it O
is O
very O
touristy O
here. O

After O
some O
time O
walking O
through O
the O
streets O
around O
the O
square O
we O
saw O
a O
nice O
tent B-TARGET
and O
decided O
to O
go O
inside, O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
back O
entrance. O

The O
prices O
are O
really O
very O
high, O
for O
4 O
thin O
slices O
of O
burnt O
baguette B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
garlic I-TARGET
you O
pay O
€5,50, O
and O
to O
our O
great O
disappointment O
came O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
à O
+/- O
€13,50 O
from O
the O
freezer! O

Also O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
too O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
smile O
off. O

Spend O
your O
money O
somewhere O
else! O

As O
a O
tourist O
you O
walk O
in O
the O
beautiful O
city O
of O
Bruges O
and O
at O
some O
point O
you O
feel O
like O
having O
a O
good O
meal. O

You O
walk O
on O
the O
market O
where O
many O
eateries O
invite O
you O
with O
attractively O
priced O
menus O

You O
sit O
on O
the O
terrace O
and O
order O
something O
from O
the O
menu O
card. O

The O
main O
dishes O
are O
not O
standard O
fries O
or O
vegetables O
that O
you O
can O
order O
as O
a O
supplement. O

NOTE: O
If O
the O
waiter O
asks O
you O
if O
you O
want O
baguette B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
herbal I-TARGET
butter, I-TARGET
this O
costs O
€5.5- O
for O
a O
plate O
with O
3 O
pathetic O
pieces O
of O
baguette O
per O
person O
so O
not O
even O
a O
basket O
for O
more O
people! O

The O
fries B-TARGET
that O
you O
have O
to O
order O
separately O
cost O
€,- O
for O
a O
very O
small O
portion O
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
of O
€3,- O
is O
far O
too O
watery. O

Drinks B-TARGET
are O
abnormally O
expensive, O
€6,- O
for O
a O
Coke O
and O
€9,50 O
for O
a O
Belgian O
beer! O

And O
then O
they O
dare O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
give O
up O
your O
table O
because O
there O
is O
a O
group O
of O
10 O
people O
who O
need O
your O
table. O

If O
you O
talk O
to O
the O
waiter O
afterwards O
about O
the O
price O
then O
he O
is O
familiar O
with O
this O
but O
it O
is O
up O
to O
the O
location, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
without O
explanation O
sell O
plates B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
baguette I-TARGET
for O
€5,5 O

This O
entrepreneur B-TARGET
clearly O
doesn't O
want O
to O
move O
customers O
to O
come O
back O
the O
next O
day, O
no O
every O
customer O
that O
they O
can O
pull O
a O
leg O
is O
there O
again O
cash O
register O
and O
tomorrow O
hundreds O
of O
tourists O
are O
walking O
into O
this O
trap O
again! O

If O
you O
don't O
want O
your O
stay O
in O
Bruges O
to O
be O
ruined, O
don't O
eat O
on O
the O
market, O
but O
find O
another O
nice O
place O
to O
eat O
where O
they O
are O
familiar O
with O
the O
term O
customer O
loyalty O
and O
where O
the O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
normal! O

EXCELLENT O
EXPERIENCE O
Bad O
wine B-TARGET
is O
sold O
as O
house O
wine O
for O
18.50€/1/2 O
liters O
However, O
one O
dares O
not O
show O
the O
empty O
bottle O
because O
on O
a O
large O
scale O
cheating O
is O
done O
with O
brand O
and O
quality O
fries B-TARGET
only O
half-baked, O
sauce B-TARGET
cold O
and O
on O
each O
dish O
the O
same O
staff B-TARGET
is O
ashamed O
of O
the O
way O
they O
should O
cheat O
on O
the O
clienteel O
SHOULD O
NOT O
TALK O
TO O
ANOTHER O

.. O
outside O
in O
the O
sun O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Eiermarkt, I-TARGET
a O
nice O
square O
adjacent O
to O
the O
Market. O

When O
the O
waiter O
handed O
us O
the O
menu, O
we O
asked O
him O
about O
the O
menu O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O
-3 O
halls O
17.50 O
euros- O

This O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
related O
to O
lunch, O
but O
we O
could O
safely O
order O
it, O
(it O
was O
about O
six O
in O
the O
evening) O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
only O
slightly O
smaller O
according O
to O
the O
waiter. B-TARGET

We O
decided O
to O
take O
the O
'adult' O
menu O
of O
29.50. O

Were O
we O
in O
a O
hurry?... O

No O
we O
didn't, O
we O
sat O
cozy, O
nice O
location, B-TARGET
people O
watching, O
beautiful O
weather! O

After O
half O
an O
hour O
my O
fish B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
came O
and O
it O
was O
excellent, O
just O
might O
be O
a O
bit O
warmer. O

My O
partner's O
escargots B-TARGET
were O
also O
delicious. O

Then O
the O
mussels, O
for O
me O
in O
white O
wine O
and O
for O
my O
husband O
with O
garlic, O
it O
tasted O
fine, O
mussels B-TARGET
a O
little O
on O
the O
small O
side. O

Okay, O
let's O
get O
some O
fries O
in O
there. O

Couple O
of O
shots O
of O
lemon O
ice O
cream. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
friendly. O

The O
bill O
was O
82.50 O
euros, O
incl. O
a O
Kirr O
(5.-) O
and O
a O
carafe O
of O
white O
wine O
of O
half O
a O
ltr O
(18.- O
euros). O

Not O
cheap, O
but O
we O
didn't O
expect O
that O
either, O
I O
generally O
thought O
Bruges O
was O
quite O
pricey, O
not O
only O
Cafe B-TARGET
Belfort. I-TARGET

Had O
we O
read O
the O
reviews O
about O
this O
restaurant O
in O
advance O
then O
we O
wouldn't O
have O
gone O
there O
to O
eat O
and O
that O
would O
have O
been O
a O
shame! O

Bar O
and O
bar O
bad O
tent. B-TARGET

I O
wouldn't O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone! O

I'm O
sitting O
there O
now O
and O
we O
were O
just O
laughed O
at O
by O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
because O
we O
ordered O
"only O
2 O
teas." O

No O
tips O
and O
we'll O
never O
come O
here O
again! O

Self-righteous O
bastards! B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
(3 O
courses) O
were O
brought O
at O
40 O
minutes, O
starter B-TARGET
was O
still O
edible, O
but O
the O
water B-TARGET
crap I-TARGET
was O
more O
blunt O
than O
chicken O
and O
looked O
terribly O
distasteful, O
the O
stew B-TARGET
was O
incredibly O
dry. O

Really O
not O
recommended... O

Laughing O
display, B-TARGET
another O
one O
already O
wrote O
about O
it O
being O
like O
Fawlty O
Towers. O

That's O
what O
we O
thought. O

We O
had O
taken O
a O
menu O
of O
17 O
euros, O
in O
advance O
pâté B-TARGET
which O
tasted O
good. O

But O
then O
we O
got O
stew O
and O
fries. O

That O
looked O
like O
a O
child's O
portion, O
five O
pieces O
of O
meat O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
fries. O

Beer B-TARGET
at O
dinner O
they O
asked O
for O
8 O
euros O
for. O

She O
tried O
to O
put O
on O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
during O
the O
meal. O

Glad O
we O
didn't. O

We O
should've O
gone O
to O
the O
fry O
house. O

What O
a O
rare O
ball B-TARGET
tent. I-TARGET

Already O
walking O
along O
the O
cozy O
Eiermarkt O
sit O
on O
terrace O
of O
restaurant O
't O
Voutje. O

Looked O
nice O
from O
the O
outside. O

We'd O
already O
eaten O
a O
little O
something O
elsewhere. O

Therefore O
selected O
for O
limited O
menu O
of O
€17,- O

Wasn't O
wrong, O
taste B-TARGET
was O
reasonable O
to O
good. O

But O
apparently O
the O
business O
was O
disappointing, O
because O
halfway O
through O
our O
meal O
they O
started O
cleaning O
up O
the O
empty O
tables O
at O
9 O
p.m. O
and O
moving O
to O
the O
'nightstand'. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
grumpy, O
couldn't O
get O
a O
smile O
off. O

In O
short, O
not O
recommended. O

Next O
time O
I'd O
really O
choose O
another O
restaurant, O
they're O
really O
enough O
in O
Bruges. O

A O
matter O
of: O
Foutje, O
thank O
you!!!! O

In O
a O
Fawlty B-TARGET
Towers I-TARGET
scene, I-TARGET
the O
female O
Basyl O
in O
front O
of O
us O
was O
wiped O
out O
the O
cloak O
of O
the O
female O
John O
Cleese, O
the O
owner. O

The O
poor O
girl B-TARGET
had O
accidentally O
served O
us O
our O
neighbors' O
mussels. O

I O
also O
ordered O
mussels, O
so O
I O
had O
started O
eating. O

Suddenly O
the O
bowl O
of O
mussels O
was O
ripped O
from O
under O
my O
nose O
by O
the O
female O
John B-TARGET
Cleese. I-TARGET

My O
remark O
that O
I O
had O
already O
eaten O
the O
mussels O
was O
answered O
with O
a O
grumpy O
sneer O
that O
this O
meal O
would O
be O
put O
in O
the O
garbage O
can. O

A O
few O
seconds O
later, O
she O
came O
to O
our O
neighbors O
with O
a O
steel O
face O
serving O
the O
same O
bowl. O

Hilarious O
for O
a O
comedy, O
reality O
is O
to O
cry, O
so O
amateuric. O

Staying O
away O
from O
this O
ball B-TARGET
joint I-TARGET
is O
my O
only O
advice. O

Coincidentally O
landed O
for O
lunch. O

Staff B-TARGET
not O
friendly. O

The O
map B-TARGET
does O
not O
indicate O
non-alcoholic O
beverages. O

If O
you O
ask, O
they O
only O
serve O
water O
per O
0.5l O
(you O
don't O
know O
the O
price O
yet). O

We O
took O
chicken O
and O
fries. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
of O
very O
poor O
quality. O

There B-TARGET
was O
no O

What O

Menu B-TARGET
taken O
with O
various O
small O
appetizers, O
great O
tasty. O

Then O
fish B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
also O
really O
good. O

Absolutely O
recommended. O

Our O
dinner O
at O
The B-TARGET
Olive I-TARGET
Tree I-TARGET
was O
a O
very O
pleasant O
surprise. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
pure O
Greek, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
incredibly O
friendly O
and O
thoughtful. O

We O
can O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
both O
locals O
and O
tourists. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
lovely O

Very O

I O
have O

because O
of O
its O
location B-TARGET
rather O
expensive O
and O
mainly O
aimed O
at O

yet O
not O
a O
bad O

Both O

We O
chose O
the O

We O
also O
got O
so O
many O
amuses, B-TARGET
that O
it O
could O
easily O
have O
gone O
through O
as O
four O
courses. O

Everything O
perfect O
to O
taste, O
fun O
and O
surprising O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
fleety O
side, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
great. O

I O
found O
the O
service B-TARGET
rather O
informal O
for O
the O
setting. O

No O
problem O
as O
far O
as O
I'm O
concerned. O

Each O
court O
clearly O
explained O
what O
it O
was O
and O
where O
it O
came O
from. O

Not O

This O

You O
will O
be O

Everything O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET

all O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
copious O
and O
tasty. O

the O
hostess, B-TARGET
also O
Bruges O
guide, O
makes O
the O
difference. O

What O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
romantic O
dinner B-TARGET
with O
a O
Grouponbon, O
became O
a O
complete O
flop. O

We've O
never O
eaten O
so O
badly! O

1 O
hour O
waiting O
for O
a O
bruchetta, B-TARGET
which O
was O
a O
dry O
piece O
of O
bread O
with O
some O
baked O
mushrooms! O

Main O
dish O
was O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
frozen I-TARGET
sea I-TARGET
fruit I-TARGET
mix I-TARGET
and O
zero O
comma O
zero O
flavor! O

Really O
no O
restaurant B-TARGET
worthy!!!! O

The O
only O
garnish O
was O
some O
unwashed O
parsley B-TARGET
that O
completely O
ruined O
the O
dish. B-TARGET

The O
sand O
still O
cracks O
between O
my O
teeth. O

They O
didn't O
have O
the O
tiramisu, O
so O
they O
ate O
a O
panna O
cotta. O

This O
was O
(from O
a O
jar), O
thrown O
on O
a O
plate O
with O
frozen O
red B-TARGET

Don't O

my O

if O
he O

Great, O
we're O
definitely O
going O

We O
ended O
up O
here O
after O
reading O
the O
opinions O
on O
Tripadvisor! O

Unfortunately O
you O
can O
only O
get O
lunch O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
but O
wanted O
to O
try O
this O
restaurant O
by O
sé O
and O
so O
went O
for O
lunch. O

Very O
tasty O
salad B-TARGET
with O
beautiful O
fresh O
salads, O
not O
those O
that O
are O
often O
served, O
straight O
out O

Taste O
finished O
with O
tasty O
dressing, B-TARGET
bacon O
bacon O

good O

As O
main O
course O
a O
piece O

fried O
salmon O
with O

fresh O

We O
can O
especially O
appreciate O
the O
latter. O

This O
occurs O
in O
too O
few O
cases O
and O
really O
appreciates O
your O
dish! O

Everything O
very O
tasty, O
and O
as O
it O
should O
be O
a O
day O
lunch, O
served O
in O
an O

We O
must O
certainly O
not O
forget O
to O
mention O
the O

Something O
to O
go O
back O
and O
try O
one O

Came O
by O
here O
looking O
for O

Goed O

basis O

reviews. O

No O

the O
three B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
Market I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
€35,- O
was O
delicious. O

We O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
of O
€35 O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
flavors O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
came O
to O
their O
senses. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
this O
beautiful O
building O
is O
casual O
and O
pleasant. O

We O
can O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Bruges. O

Very O
smooth O
operation, B-TARGET
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
also O
very O
tasty O
ribs. B-TARGET

Price/quality O
in O
good O
order. O

Only O
downside: O
difficult O
parking O
nearby B-TARGET

Friendly O
reception B-TARGET
and O
very O
smooth O
operation B-TARGET
afterwards. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
(but O
not O
the O
ribs O
taken) O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
huge. O

Price/quality O
is O
correct. O

In O
short, O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
repetition. O

It O
was O
a O
while O
ago... O
but O
yesterday O
an O
unexpected O
stop O
made, O
and O
of O
course O
cannot O
resist O
these O
sweet O
temptations.... O
brownie B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
ginger I-TARGET
was O
superjammy!!!!! O

Very O
tasty O
patisserie! B-TARGET

Unbelievable O
eclairs.. B-TARGET

But O
I O
think O
the O
bread B-TARGET
is O
too O
expensive! O

Nice O
of O
you O
to O
look O
inside O
the O
studio! B-TARGET

Breakfast O
between O
the O
books, O
you O
don't O
come O
across O
that O
often. O

Here O
you O
are O
surrounded O
by O
walls O
full O
of O
books O
in O
a O
cozy O
setting. O

Placed O
above O
his O
seats O
so O
you O
can O
easily O
read O
a O
book O
while O
enjoying O
your O
drink. O

Breakfast B-TARGET
is O
served, O
fresh O
and O
tasty. O

There O
is O
a O
choice B-TARGET
between O
different O
formulas. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
smooth O
and O
friendly. O

Here O
come O
lunch O
with O
girlfriend, O
because O
our O
regular O
lunch O
spot O
was O
closed O
for O
annual O
leave. O

Had O
read O
many O
positive O
things O
about O
it, O
but O
wish O
to O
explain O
our O
experience O
- O
if O
only O
so O
that O
the O
operators O
may O
be O
able O
to O
work O
on O
it. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
have O
lunch O
during O
your O
lunch O
break, O
nobody O
expects O
you O
to O
have O
eaten O
at O
10 O
minutes, O
otherwise O
you'll O
get O
a O
sandwich. O

But O
in O
this O
case O
they O
took O
their O
time! O

There O
were O
a O
number O
of O
5 O
tables O
occupied, O
total O
of O
about O
12 O
people. O

1 O
table O
of O
4 O
was O
already O
brunching O
when O
we O
arrived, O
so O
that O
makes O
8 O
people O
who O
need O
to O
be O
served. O

In O
the O
kitchen O
there O
was O
a O
woman O
making O
food, O
a O
man O
serving O
the O
hall. O

Although O
we O
quickly O
got O
our O
drinks, O
it O
took O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
man B-TARGET
to O
pick O
up O
our O
food O
order. O

Choice B-TARGET
is O
limited, O
covered O
bagels, O
special O
croques O
of O
thick O
slices O
of O
bread, O
cheese/meat O
plate,. O
Eventually O
both O
me O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
took O
a O
croque. O

Well O
cared O
for, O
with O
a O
little O
lettuce O
in O
it. O

Croque O
cheese O
and O
ham O
and O
croque O
with O
brie+honey. O

Served O
25 O
minutes O
waiting O
for O
this. O

I O
really O
don't O
get O
this. O

Bread, O
siege O
in O
between O
and O
in O
the O
panini. O

Can't O
take O
that O
long. O

Other O
tables O
were O
served O
just O
as O
slowly. O

I O
understand O
that O
the O
woman O
in O
the O
kitchen O
has O
only O
two O
hands, O
but O
the O
man B-TARGET
stood O
behind O
the O
bar O
- O
if O
I'm O
not O
mistaken O
- O
playing O
with O
his O
cell O
phone. O

If O
you O
have O
lunch-rush-hour O
you O
can O
at O
least O
jump O
in O
so O
everyone O
is O
served O
quickly. O

Even O
after O
dinner O
it O
took O
at O
least O
10 O
minutes O
(and O
a O
beck O
and O
call O
from O
us) O
before O
the O
man B-TARGET
came O
to O
clear O
our O
plates O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
anything O
more. O

Our O
afternoon O
break O
was O
almost O
over, O
so O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
bill. O

This O
came O
as O
slow O
as O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
so O
we're O
going O
to O
pay O
at O
the O
bar. O

Apparently, O
they O
thought O
this O
was O
rather O
rude. O

I O
can't O
believe O
they O
don't O
understand O
that O
many O
people O
have O
to O
be O
back O
at O
work O
after O
an O
hour O
of O
lunch O
and O
that O
there's O
no O
play!! O

Plus: O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
cared O
for. O

(but O
with O
a O
toasty O
you O
can O
do O
little O
wrong.) O

Prices O
are O
also O
really O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
for O
lunch, B-TARGET
if O
I O
pay O
over O
15 O
euros O
for O
lunch O
I O
already O
have O
a O
steak O
+ O
fries, O
full-au-vent, O
or O
a O
well-kept O
plate O
of O
pasta O
on O
most O
bistros. O

For O
1 O
toastie O
and O
1 O
glass O
of O
Coke O
this O
is O
seriously O
exaggerated!! O

Conclusion: O
go O
here O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time, O
or O
if O
you O
just O
want O
to O
drink O
a O
coffee/tea O
while O
reading O
a O
book. O

Unlike O
many O
restaurants, O
they O
won't O
scare O
you O
out O
of O
here O
because O
you're O
gonna O
sit O
around O
too O
long. O

If O
you O
only O
have O
an O
hour O
for O
lunch, O
you'd O
better O
go O
somewhere O
else... O

It O
was O
pleasant O
to O
linger, O
very O
friendly O
people B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
certainly O
appropriate, O
a O
fast O
decent O
bite. O

Someone O
who O
loves O
self-made B-TARGET
iced I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
is O
at O
the O
right O
address. O

The O

At O
the O
advice O
of O
Carolien O

B&B O
Côte O
Canal O
in O

we O
ended O
up O
here. O

It O

food. B-TARGET

The O

Pomperlut B-TARGET
is O
an O
attractive O
restaurant, O
nicely O
decorated O
and O
cosy. O

Little O
choice B-TARGET
but O
still O
enough O
to O
let O
you O
serve O
a O
nice O
menu. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
cool O
but O
still O
correct. O

Highly O
recommended O
for O
the O
winter O
months O
when O
the O
large O
fireplace O
gives O
nice O
crackling O
heat. O

An O
atmospheric, O
cozy O
setting. B-TARGET

Super O
good O
food, O
more O
than O
usual. O

Ideal O
for O
romantic O
evenings O
or O
good O
friends. O

We're O
definitely O
going O
back, O
but O
maybe O
only O
with O
women, O
because O
Peter, B-TARGET
who O
was O
our O
servant O
was O
a O
caress O
to O
the O
eye. O

Fine O
too! O

By O
chance O
we O
ended O
up O
in O
this O
'cottage' O
where O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
nice O
piece O
of O
'Limousin' B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
on O
the O
inside O
terrace. O

Super O
cool O
service, B-TARGET
custom O
wines B-TARGET
and O
that O
in O
a O
nice O
and O
quiet O
setting, B-TARGET
away O
from O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
at O
the O
Sand O
and O
its O
tourist O
traps. O

It O
was O
a O
relief O
for O
us O
to O
take O
a O
moment O
from O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
of O
the O
market O
in O
Bruges O
in O
peace O
and O
very O

to O
enjoy O

you O
will O
be O
informed O
about O
lactose- O
and O
gluten-free O
recipes. O

The O
combination B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
varieties I-TARGET
was O
special. O

Delicious. O

It O
is O
not O
always O
easy O
for O
vegetarians O
to O
find O
a O
restaurant O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
well O
and O
stylishly. O

I O
can O
do O
it O
in O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Delicious, O
honest O
and O
separate. O

If O
living O
in O
Bruges, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
highly O
recommended O
and O
one O
I O
would O
recommend O
to O
others. O

It O
is O
cared O
for O
and O
very O
fresh O
food. B-TARGET

The O
chef B-TARGET
shows O
a O
great O
passion O
and O
passion O
for O
his O
profession. O

I've O
been O
here O
several O
times, O
and O
it's O
been O
fine. O

You O
get O
more O
than O
worth O
for O
your O
money! O

Have O
eaten O
here O
several O
times O
and O
each O
time O
smooth O
operation, B-TARGET
very O
nice O
to O
eat, O
nicely O
presented O
and O
spacious O
portions B-TARGET
as O
well. O

Very O
reasonable O
in O
price O
and O
many O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
you O
won't O
find O
anywhere O
else O
right O
away. O

The O
Lasagna B-TARGET
is O
awesome. O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work! O

My O
girlfriend O
and O
I O
had O
a O
nice O
meal O
here. O

It's O
not O
the O
usual O
restaurant, B-TARGET
it's O
something O
else. O

Beautiful, O
modern O
interior B-TARGET
and O
a O
cook B-TARGET
where O
you O
will O
notice O
that O
he O
is O
very O
passionate O
about O
eating! O

The O
fresh O
lemonade B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
bitter O
but O
the O
food, O
in O
our O
case O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
quiche I-TARGET
tasted O
incredibly O
good. O

And O
then O
I O
haven't O
mentioned O
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
an O
own O
version O
of O
a O
snicker O
highly O
recommended. O

I O
found O
this O
little O
restaurant O
through O
tripadvisor. O

When O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
and O
saw O
the O
pictures O
I O
definitely O
wanted O
to O
eat O
there. O

When O
you O
step O
inside O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
will O
be O
immersed O
in O
what O
I O
think O
should O
be O
the O
ideal O
world O
according O
to O
these O
two O
nice O
young O
people. O

In O
an O
hour O
you O
will O
unwind, O
you O
will O
eat O
fantastic O
and O
you O
will O
see O
two O
people B-TARGET
who O
are O
100% O
behind O
this O
concept. O

I'd O
say O
keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
and O
we'll O
definitely O
see O
you O
again. O

We O
have O
delicious O
food O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
tasty O
wine. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
was O
neat, O
ambiance B-TARGET
atmospheric O
and O
cozy. O

Really O
had O
a O
great O
night, O
we'll O
definitely O
be O
back! O

The O
Park B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
is O
definitely O
worth O
it, O
but O
can O
be O
judged O
as O
a O
total O
concept: O
very O
friendly O
and O
personal O
reception, B-TARGET
nice, O
cozy O
and O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
warm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
background O
music O
(we O
were O
in O
the O
second O
part O
on O
a O
mezzanine, O
recommended) O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
"good O
civilian O
kitchen," O
don't O
expect O
top O
gastronomy. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
spacious O
are O
worked O
with O
fresh O
ingredients. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
(many O
staff O
present) O
but O
lacks O
some O
experience O
and O
smoothness, O
sometimes O
rather O
clumsy. O

There O
is O
perhaps O
1 O
point O
of O
interest: O
the O
plumbing B-TARGET
is O
very O
neat O
and O
spacious, O
but O
there O
is O
only O
1 O
toilet O
for O
ladies O
and O
1 O
for O
men. O

Still O
little O
for O
a O
rather O
large O
restaurant. O

Good O
food B-TARGET
The O
service B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
thoughtful O
and O
knows O
what O
they're O
talking O
about O
like O
the O
wine O
and O
what O
to O
eat O
on O
your O
plate O

Also O
the O
personal O
attention O
of O
the O
chef B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice O
I O
would O
recommend O
everyone O
to O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
once O
to O
book O
over O
the O
internet O

We O
ate O
last O
weekend O
at O
Park B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
my O
friend's O
birthday O
and O
it O
was O
a O
very O
successful O
evening. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
was O
to O
enjoy, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
fits O
perfectly O
with O
the O
dishes, O
and O
we O
are O
very O
kindly O
received. O

In O
short: O
a O
must O
for O
a O
weekend O
in O
Bruges! O

Rude O
operation, B-TARGET
very O
high O
prices, O
51 O
euros O
for O
3 O
coffee, O
3 O
"apple O
pastries" O
and O
2 O
cola. O

And O
if O
hit O
on O
the O
flare O
a O
big O
mouth... O
the O
customer O
shouldn't O
bitch O
but O
had O
to O
tip. O

We O
hope O
that O
something O
can O
be O
done O
about O
this, O
because O
this O
is O
an O
absolute O
low O
in O
such O
a O
beautiful O
city. O

Staff B-TARGET
don't O
look O
at O
you, O
haggle O
your O
food O
on O
your O
table, O
and O
don't O
even O
bother O
to O
say O
anything O
to O
you. O

If O
you O
ask O
for O
bread, B-TARGET
you O
get O
a O
stack O
of O
sandwiches O
out O
of O
a O
plastic O
bag. O

And O
that O
at O
the O
prices B-TARGET
; O
4 O
Euro O
80 O
for O
a O
beer O
and O
six O
and O
half O
Euro O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
white O
house O
wine. O

Number O
one O
Tourist O
Fall. O

Avoid O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

On O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
hotelier O
we O
have O
visited O
this O
restaurant. O

Excellent O
ambiance B-TARGET
and O
an O
attractive O
card. B-TARGET

All O
the O
members O
of O
our O
company O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
successful O
evening. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
very O
thoughtful. O

A O
point O
of O
interest O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
is O
the O
use O
of O
herbs; O
where O
the O
soup B-TARGET
to O
my O
taste O
had O
an O
overly O
pronounced O
peppery O
taste O
which O
overshadowed O
other O
tastes, O
the O
deer B-TARGET
nuts I-TARGET
were O
rather O
'coaf' O
seasoned. O

Given O
the O
price O
level, O
I O
think O
perfection O
is O
the O
norm O
and O
that O
level O
was O
just O
not O
reached O
this O
evening. O

This O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
Bruges O
side O
street O
is O
highly O
recommended. O

From O
the O
moment O
I O
came O
in, O
I O
felt O
at O
home O
here, O
everything O
was O
right. O

We O
had O
chosen O
the O
suggestion O
menu O
with O
custom O
wines. O

Especially O
the O
baby B-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
water I-TARGET
mess I-TARGET
surprised O
me O
very O
pleasantly. O

I O
can O
only O
agree O
with O
the O
other O
praises. O

Tables O
of O
7 O
men O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
retirement. O

Various O
aperitifs, O
the O
monthly O
menu O
with O
custom O
wines, O
dessert, O
coffee+pousse-café. O

A O
fluke! O

This O
restaurant O
located O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Bruges O
in O
the O
Amandstraatje O
already O
exists O
for O
27 O
years O
with O
the O
same O
chef O
and O
his O
lovely O
wife. O

Finally O
a O
classic O
kitchen B-TARGET
again, O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
without O
too O
much O
cinema! O

Price O
quality O
excellent, O
we O
were O
with O
4 O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
month O
menu. O

We O
have O
been O
here O
Saturday O
night O
with O
a O
group O
of O
17 O
people O
and O
were O
very O
friendly! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
smooth. O

Even O
with O
such O
a O
large O
group, O
everyone O
could O
just O
choose O
from O
the O
map. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
October O
we O
still O
have O
outside O
on O
the O
terrace O
above O
can O
aperitifs O
and O
then O
inside O
eat. O

Dinner B-TARGET
was O
good. O

Lots O
of O
choice B-TARGET
and O
everyone O
was O
satisfied O
with O
his/her O
dish. B-TARGET

A O
big O
plume O
for O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
this O
case! O

One O
day... O

Or O
there O
was O
once... O

Most O
fairy O
tales O
generally O
start O
out O
like O
this O
and O
yes: O
'Once O
upon O
a O
time O
'the O
Zeezot O
was O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
be O
with O
a O
sympathetic O
patron, O
a O
good O
service O
and O
good O
food... O

Unfortunately, O
over O
the O
last O
few O
years, O
we O
have O
seen O
this O
fade O
into O
a O
level O
far O
below O
all O
levels: O
customer-unfriendly O
patron, B-TARGET
bad O
food B-TARGET
and O
no O
service... B-TARGET

Only O
the O
'kching' O
of O
the O
cash O
register O
counts O
and O
you're O
not O
satisfied? O

Then O
there's O
the O
door... O

Best O
advice? O

Just O
stay O
away O
from O
here, O
because O
there O
are O
very O
much O
better O
and O
more O
sympathetic O
restaurants O
in O
Ostend O
where O
they O
at O
least O
know O
what O
good O
food O
and O
real O
customer-friendly O
service O
is! O

Well... O

We O
came O
several O
times, O
last O
time O
it O
was O
always O
very O
good. O

This O
time O
I O
took O
the O
fish B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
'little I-TARGET
bouillabaise' I-TARGET
this O
was O
in O
my O
opinion O
very O
undersized, O
The O
soup O
did O
not O
taste O
like O
fish, O
there O
was O
a O
big O
piece O
of O
salmon O
in O
it O
(which O
I O
do O
not O
like: O
so O
not O
their O
fault) O
there O
was O
the O
head O
of O
a O
langoust O
(I O
do O
like O
it) O
so O
unfortunately O
only O
the O
head. O

The O
shells O
were O
way O
too O
far O
and O
there O
were O
crabs O
in O
them. O

So O
with O
the O
question O
it O
was O
nice: O
no+the O
reason, O
so O
you O
might O
think O
a O
small O
discount O
or O
a O
coffee, O
however O
none O
of O
this. O

We O
paid O
the O
coffee O
ourselves O
and O
after O
having O
left O
no O
drinking O
money O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
6 O
years, O
not O
even O
a O
good O
day O
outside. O

Too O
bad O
catering O
and O
then O
complain. O

And O
say O
we've O
already O
recommended O
this O
case B-TARGET
to O
friends. O

Thierry O
Laenens O

Meat O
and O
fish B-TARGET
of O
the O
best O
quality, O
friendly O
served O
in O
a O
professional O
way. O

(Not O
by O
chance O
because O
we O
have O
been O
there O
several O
times!) O

I O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
but O
it's O
just O
too O
expensive. O

The O
Irish B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
indeed O
comes O
to O
the O
boss' B-TARGET
table, O
you O
pay O
10 O
euros O
for O
it O
and O
this O
is O
just O
too O
expensive. O

When O
we O
left O
the O
case O
we O
were O
almost O
obliged O
to O
write O
a O
good O
review O
here. O

With O
this O
one, O
it's O
just O
my O
honest O
opinion. O

Super O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
dog O
friendly! O

We O
even O
got O
our O
meat O
surplus O
home O
in O
a O
handy O
reusable O
microwave-friendly O
jar. O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work!!!! O

P.s O
spectacle O
assured O
if O
you O
are O
an O
Irish O
coffee O
lover. O

There O
were O
six O
of O
us O
and O
we O
expected O
more O
of O
this, O
of O
course. O

2 O
of O
us O
had O
ordered O
the O
salmon O
from O
around O
and O
at O
the O
24€ O
with O
fries O
1 O
had O
the O
steak B-TARGET
(not O
yet O
125 O
gr) O
23€ O
with O
fries O
1 O
had O
sat O
19€ O
with O
fries O
1 O
scampi O
in O
curry O
with O
bread O
the O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
was O
not O
to O
be O
seen O
and O
the O
steak B-TARGET
almost O
not O
to O
be O
found. O

Fortunately, O
they O
serve O
it O
on O
a O
plate O
without O
garnish O
that O
was O
placed O
separately O
in O
a O
bowl O
on O
the O
plate, O
otherwise O
we O
would O
not O
have O
found O
the O
piece O
of O
fish O
or O
meat. O

1 O
dish O
of O
fries B-TARGET
for O
5 O
adults O
was O
well O
undersized O
and O
ordered O
fries O
came O
after O
our O
plates O
had O
been O
empty O
for O
quite O
some O
time. O

However, O
they O
were O
ordered O
in O
good O
time. O

After O
we O
had O
informed O
the O
pattern B-TARGET
of O
our O
displeasure, O
he O
spoke O
arrogantly O
to O
us O
and O
pointed O
out O
to O
us O
that O
these O
are O
the O
normal O
portions O
he O
presents O
to O
his O
customers. O

We O
wonder O
if O
the O
child's O
portion O
is O
the O
same O
size O
as O
ours. O

(children O
will O
certainly O
not O
have O
eaten O
their O
belly O
full O
of O
adults) O

You O
were O
warned! O

Dinner O
with O
a O
groupon O
on O
this O
case. O

Already O
badly O
eaten, O
tastes O
can O
differ, O
but O
being O
sick O
of O
it O
is O
really O
not O
normal O
anymore. O

Appetizers: O
"Lightly B-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
tuna" I-TARGET
was O
baked. O

"Scampi B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
look" I-TARGET
was O
not O
excessive, O
they O
swam O
in O
the O
butter, O
incredibly O
much O
look. O

I O
still O
taste O
it O
the O
day O
after, O
and O
everything's O
been O
coming O
out O
hours. O

Main O
dishes O
Fried O
ribs O
with O
3 O
sauces, O
rib B-TARGET
had O
been O
warmed O
up O
exactly O
once, O
the O
taste O
was O
a O
bit O
strange, O
but O
I O
thought O
of O
a O
strange O
marinade. O

The O
sauces B-TARGET
(made O
at O
home?) O
had O
exactly O
multiple O
colors O
(for O
the O
sake O
of O
clarity, O
the O
same O
sauce O
had O
different O
colors O
after O
stirring O
in O
it). O

There O
was O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
fat O
attached O
to O
the O
ribs. B-TARGET

The O
steak O
with O
bearnaise O
sauce O
of O
my O
girlfriend O
was O
ordered O
seignantly, O
but O
been O
cuit O
delivered, O
after O
this O
clear O
answer O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
oh O
I O
said O
bc O
but O
I O
didn't O
really O
know, O
must O
be O
signant, O
the O
steak O
was O
just O
not O
black... O

The O
fries... B-TARGET
do O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
same O
atmosphere O
as O
other O
comments, O
even O
these O
in O
the O
MacDonalds O
are O
better. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
that O
was O
given O
was O
okay. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
still O
the O
best, O
but O
apparently O
we O
were O
lucky. O

The O
same O
tiramisu B-TARGET
near O
the O
neighbors O
was O
hard O
and O
only O
warm O
at O
the O
bottom, O
sounds O
like O
microwave O
to O
me. O

Mine O
didn't O
have O
this, O
but O
I O
ordered O
the O
dessert O
in O
advance, O
the O
neighbors O
after O
their O
main O
course. O

My O
girlfriend O
had O
apple B-TARGET
pie, I-TARGET
which O
she O
thought O
was O
okay. O

The O
wine... B-TARGET
let's O
just O
say O
I've O
already O
drank O
better O
for O
much O
less O
than O
22 O
euros. O

Immediately O
after O
dessert O
we O
left O
without O
words, O
given O
other O
comments O
a O
good O
decision. O

After O
10 O
minutes, O
we're O
home, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
already O
feels O
it O
coming, O
straight O
to O
the O
bathroom. O

I've O
been O
uncomfortable O
all O
night O
and O
night, O
feeling O
like O
I'm O
going O
to O
vomit, O
but O
it's O
not O
coming. O

I O
get O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
everything O
goes O
back O
out. O

This O
case B-TARGET
should O
be O
closed, O
because O
I O
am O
clearly O
not O
the O
only O
one O
who O
has O
had O
a O
bad O
experience O
here. O

The O
sea O
dike O
doesn't O
always O
have O
a O
good O
reputation, O
but O
business O
like O
this O
certainly O
doesn't O
do O
a O
good O
thing O
about O
it. O

Yesterday, O
me O
and O
my O
friend O
thought O
we'd O
have O
a O
nice O
dinner O
with O
the O
good O
weather. O

He O
ordered O
a O
pasta O
carbonara, O
I O
ordered O
a O
sugar O
pancake. O

When O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
food O
at O
the O
table O
after O
half O
an O
hour, O
we O
each O
took O
one O
bite O
of O
our O
dish B-TARGET
and O
then O
realized O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
eat! O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
carbonara I-TARGET
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
hard O
layer O
of O
cold O
cheese, O
cream O
and O
soaked O
spaghetti, O
and O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
were O
made O
exactly O
in O
a O
pan O
they O
hadn't O
washed O
in O
days. O

It's O
horrible! O

The O
waiter O
(a O
job O
student) O
went O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
with O
our O
plates O
but O
we O
just O
got O
them O
back, O
and O
the O
chef B-TARGET
said O
that O
both O
these O
dishes O
were O
normal O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
them. O

Because O
my O
friend O
had O
barely O
taken O
two O
bites O
of O
his O
pasta, O
he O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it, O
after O
which O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
did O
very O
frank O
and O
forced O
us O
to O
pay!!!!!!! O

We'll O
never O
come O
back O
here O
and O
advise O
against O
anyone. O

Even O
for O
free, O
it's O
not O
worth O
it O
and O
it's O
ruining O
your O
day O
and O
mood. O

If O
I O
could O
I O
would O
place O
it O
at O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
itself O
a O
sign O
to O
advise O
against O
all O
visitors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

Nice O
and O
cozy O
family O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Class O
meals B-TARGET
and O
positive O
in O
price/quality. O

Coming O
out O
with O
a O
satisfied O
and O
happy O
feeling. O

Great O
people B-TARGET
with O
a O
nice, O
friendly O
and O
cared O
for O
look. O

more O
than O
repeatable, O
recommended. O

Nice O
and O
cozy O
service, B-TARGET
class O
meals. B-TARGET

For O
me O
it's O
definitely O
the O
coolest O
and O
nicest O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Ostend. O

I O
will O
jump O
in O
here O
regularly O
and O
then O
not O
only O
for O
the O
good O
food B-TARGET
but O
also O
for O
the O
hospitality. O

First O
of O
all, O
we O
were O
very O
nicely O
received O
by O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

Then O
the O
food B-TARGET
came O
and O
that O
was O
perfect! O

Best O
lamb B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
in O
a O
while. O

The O
couscous B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
well O
prepared. O

We'll O
definitely O
be O
back. O

All O
tip O
top O
in O
order... O
eat B-TARGET
super O
tasty... O
very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
so O
much O
more... O
very O
nice O
also O
for O
family O
occasions... O
little O
money O
and O
lots O
to O
eat... O

Cozy O
renovated O
terrace, B-TARGET
but O
because O
it O
was O
fresh O
still O
went O
inside O
to O
eat. O

Very O
outdated O
restaurant, B-TARGET
dusty O
curtains, O
sofas O
and O
chairs O
seriously O
damaged, O
mussels O
naturally O
ordered. O

3 O
hairs O
(from O
the O
cook). O

Bucket B-TARGET
rusted O
and O
well-damaged. O

Flat O
fries B-TARGET
added, O
sour O
and O
running O
mayo. B-TARGET

Girlfriend O
was O
full O
of O
au B-TARGET
guy, I-TARGET
but O
she O
looked O
like O
he'd O
been O
eaten O
before... O

They O
don't O
see O
me O
there O
anymore, O
far O
too O
expensive O
for O
such O
a O
bad O
quality! O

I'm O
not O
often O
critical O
of O
my O
food. O

If O
it's O
okay, O
it's O
okay. O

But O
this O
was O
anything O
but O
good. O

Very O
unfriendly O
staff B-TARGET
eating B-TARGET
was O
very O
moderate. O

Price O
quality O
ratio O
clearly O
doesn't O
add O
up O
here. O

Not O
recommended. O

Without O
your O
money. O

This O
is O
definitely O
not O
recommended, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
faint O

If O
you O
like O
to O
eat O
well O
this O
is O
certainly O
not O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
should O
take, O
there O
are O
much O
better O
in O
Ostend, O
unfortunately O
because O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
beautiful... O
on O
the O
market O

There O
have O
also O
been O
several O
dinners O
with O
groupon. O

Don't O
imagine O
a O
top O
restaurant, O
but... O
we O
were O
kindly O
welcomed, O
got O
proper O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

There O
were O
dinner O
on O
Sunday O
evening O
November O
02 O
with O
voucher O
from O
groupon, O
had O
a O
wide O
choice O
of O
menus, B-TARGET
got O
a O
nice O
table B-TARGET
at O
the O
window O
with O
candlelight, O
good O
and O
fast O
operation. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
good, O
nothing O
to O
notice. O

from O
where O
then O
those O
bad O
reviews???? O

Of O
course O
there O
is O
a O
large O
terrace O
at O
the O
institution O
and O
in O
summer O
with O
nice O
weather O
it O
is O
sometimes O
overcrowded O
there, O
but O
that O
is O
known O
when O
we O
come O
to O
the O
sea O
with O
nice O
weather O
that O
one O
asks O
behind O
problems, O
which O
in O
general O
already O
start O
on O
the O
car O
strade, O
no O
parking O
spaces, O
etc O
etc O
etc O
etc O

We O
sat O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
full O
in O
the O
autumn O
sun, O
lovely O
spot! O

Unfortunately, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
over O
20 O
minutes O
until O
we O
could O
order. O

Menu B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
unclear O
(French O
and O
Dutch O
mixed O
up). O

Pretty O
good O
soup B-TARGET
and O
shrimp B-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
though. O

But O
the O
lady B-TARGET
from O
the O
ministry O
called O
out O
two O
other O
guests O
to O
a O
disagreement O
on O
the O
receipt. O

A O
little O
later, O
my O
girlfriend O
was O
chased O
away O
because O
she O
took O
the O
wrong O
door O
to O
the O
bathroom. O

Never O
again! O

When O
I O
read O
the O
most O
recent O
reviews O
I O
can O
only O
confirm, O
after O
my O
visit O
on O
Saturday O
night O
25/10, O
that O
a O
bit O
of O
elementary O
"class" O
is O
far O
away. O

Indeed, O
long O
wait, O
drink B-TARGET
not O
chilled, O
rude, O
no, O
rude O
service, B-TARGET
burnt O
food B-TARGET
and O
then O
as O
a O
customer O
carefully O
make O
a O
comment, O
you O
have O
to O
(dixit) O
"stop O
with O
your O
whining"... O

It O
is O
my O
personal O
impression O
that O
this O
business B-TARGET
runs O
on O
(day) O
tourists O
or O
customers O
who O
come O
here O
once O
and O
never O
again. O

They're O
never O
gonna O
see O
me O
here O
anymore! O

Ma'am, O
sir, O
I've O
always O
been O
polite O
and O
correct, O
and O
I O
promised O
you, O
after O
the O
police O
visit O
where O
I, O
of O
course, O
drew O
the O
shortest O
conclusion, O
that O
I O
wouldn't O
leave O
it O
at O
that. O

You O
can O
consider O
this O
step O
one. O

This O
is O
a O
promise. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
quick O
bite O
in O
Ostend O
there O
are O
dozens O
of O
other O
addresses O
than O
the O
McDonalds!!! B-TARGET

If O
necessary O
go O
to O
the O
quays O
to O
get O
some O
fish O
snacks O
or O
get O
a O
sandwich O
in O
the O
local O
butchers O
or O
the O
Panos! O

Very O
dirty, O
barely O
clearing O
tables. O

The O
toilet B-TARGET
visit I-TARGET
(well, O
children O
can't O
wait) O
is O
hell! O

Hot, O
dirty O
floors, O
stink, O
long O
queue... B-TARGET

I O
do O
not O
speak O
out O
about O
McDonalds O
in O
general, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
crime O
if O
you O
go O
to O
the O
McDo B-TARGET
in O
Ostend!!! O

It O
is O
never O
really O
clean O
and O
the O
floor B-TARGET
is O
always O
very O
sticky. O

You O
also O
have O
a O
lot O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
cold O
there O
or O
that O
machines B-TARGET
are O
broken O
vb O
mc O
furry. O

But O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly. O

Aperitif O
ordered O
-2 O
times O
rye O
and O
half O
liter O
of O
house O
wine. O

Aperitif O
OK O
-about O
7' O
afterwards O
come O
the O
appetizers...OK O
can O
happen. O

Afterwards O
came O
the O
rye: B-TARGET
so O
dehydrated O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
it O
off O
the O
bone. O

- O
This O
wasn't O
edible. O

When O
I O
made O
the O
comment, O
I O
was O
answered O
that O
the O
other O
side O
was O
less O
dry. O

So O
I O
immediately O
requested O
the O
bill. O

Any O
positive O
point: O
the O
rye O
was O
not O
charged O
out O
of O
honest O
shame??? O

A O
dinner B-TARGET
that O
is O
engraved O
in O
memory:( O

Upon O
entering O
already O
surprised O
that O
there O
is O
fixed O
carpet O
throughout O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

After O
a O
while, O
I O
got O
the O
menu... B-TARGET
this O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
scrapbook O
literally O
and O
figuratively. O

Prices O
adjusted O
with O
a O
stick O
and O
the O
card B-TARGET
sticks O
to O
your O
hands. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
a O
filthy O
ring O
map O
that O
was O
completely O
crumpled O
and O
stuck O
to O
your O
hands. O

We O
have O
wisely O
not O
looked O
into O
this. O

In O
the O
end, O
purely O
chosen O
for O
the O
filet. O

Was O
clearly O
2nd O
grade O
meat B-TARGET
and O
was O
hardly O
warm, O
sauces B-TARGET
are O
available O
in O
jars O
of O
the O
fryer. O

The O
boys B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
ministry I-TARGET
try O
to O
do O
their O
best, O
but O
unfortunately O
they O
cannot O
save O
the O
suspected O
calf. O

If O
you're O
favorite O
of O
crawling O
and O
flying O
insects, O
you'll O
get O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
it. O

Flys O
come O
to O
eat, O
squashed O
backs O
against O
the O
windows O
and O
Sebastian O
the O
spider O
in O
his O
huge O
web O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
rear O
window... O
definitely O
all O
inside O
to O
admire. O

Positive O

lovers, O
dogs O
can O
join O

It O
was O
a O
bit O
of O
doubt O
between O
a O
restaurant O
a O
little O
further O
away O
where O
you O
could O
eat O
mussels O
in O
white O
wine O
sauce O
with O
cream O
and O
garlic O
for O
just O
over O
20 O
euros O
or O
La O
Sirene, O
where O
they O
offered O
mussels O
nature O
for O
13 O
euros. O

7 O
euros O
is O
a O
very O
big O
difference, O
so O
La O
Sirene O
has O
only O
been O
chosen. O

I O
don't O
regret O
it. O

The O
mussels B-TARGET
were O
delicious O
and O
for O
13 O
euros O
you O
get O
them O
almost O
nowhere. O

Fried B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mayonnaise I-TARGET
was O
included O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
friendly. O

Timely O
reserved O
for O
a O
group O
of O
30 O
people. O

But O
when O
we O
arrived O
there, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
closed, O
on O
holiday. O

Apparently, O
no O
one O
thought O
to O
tell O
us O
about O
this. O

Apparently O
not O
even O
a O
simple O
"allo O
allo" O
could O
get O
rid O
of O
it. O

Pleasant O
is O
different... O

The O
treatment O
of O
beers B-TARGET
and O
others O
is O
very O
limited O

The O
prices O
on O
the O
high O
side O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
slow. O

Clearly, O
we O
can O
do O
better. O

Do O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
nice O
and O
cheap? O

day O
dishes O
in O
the O
afternoon O
and O
in O
the O

and O
choice O

You'll O

on O
the O

in O

with O
a O
nice O
terrace. B-TARGET

A O
nice O
place B-TARGET
on O
a O
beautiful O
Kortrijks O
square. O

Nice O
frame. B-TARGET

We O
took O
the O
menu O
to O
36 O

with O
snacks, O
tuna O
sashimi, O
deer O
calf O
with O
forest O
mushrooms O
and O
coffee O
with O
some O

All O
very O
correct O
and O
delicious. O

Very O
nice O
for O
this O
price. O

Good O
service. B-TARGET

Quality O
of O
the O
wine B-TARGET
served O
per O
glass O
could O
be O
better. O

Dinner O
night O
with O
two O
friends. O

We O
were O
well O
received O
and O
escorted O
directly O
to O
the O
table. O

Very O
pleasant O
interior. B-TARGET

On O
the O
chalkboard O
there O
were O
suggestions B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
at O
attractive O
price. O

We O
have O
chosen O
the O
tartar B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
king I-TARGET
crab, I-TARGET
very O
tasty O
and O
freshly O
prepared. O

The O
fish O
soup O
and O
homemade B-TARGET
Garnaalkroquets I-TARGET
are O
truly O
authentically O
prepared. O

Then O
a O
fillet B-TARGET

with I-TARGET

perfectly O
baked. O

And O
the O
risotto O
with O
fish. O

Very O
good O
cooked O
risotto. B-TARGET

To O
finish O
the O
evening O
another O
irish O
coffee. O

Definitely O
recommended O
both O
interior, B-TARGET
service, B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

I'll O
see O
you O
around. O

What O
a O
disappointment. O

It O
all O
looks O
beautiful O
and O
promising O
but O
eating B-TARGET
is O
a O
disaster. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
far O
from O
cordial, O
to O
advise O
against O
the O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
month. I-TARGET

The O
appetizer B-TARGET
is O
full; O
flower O
sauce O
and O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
a O
mess. O

The O
custom B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
at O
the O
menu O
are O
bad, O
the O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
is O
not O
chilled, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
numb O
and O
impersonal. O

What O
a O
waste O
of O
money. O

Never O
again. O

Together O
with O
my O
daughter O
I O
went O
for O
a O
night O
in O
restaurant O
St B-TARGET
Christophe; I-TARGET
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
for O
both! O

The O
processing O
with O
Banyuls O
at O
the O
appetizer O
was O
already O
a O
reminder O
of O
many O
holidays... O

The O
crawfish B-TARGET
could O
also O
get O
our O
approval. O

A O
big O
bravo O
for O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

And O
the O
mango B-TARGET
tango I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
was O
a O
perfect O
ending O
to O
dinner! O

Expert O
facts O
about O
the O
wines O
were O
very O
kindly O
given O
to O
us O
and O
the O
hospitality O
of O
the O
lady B-TARGET
is O
heartwarming! O

We'll O
be O
back! O

Not O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
on O
a O
summer O
Friday O
night. O

It O
was O
dinner O
in O
the O
garden O
of O
this O
beautiful O
mansion. B-TARGET

Although O
very O
cozy, O
the O
garden B-TARGET
needs O
some O
maintenance. O

Not O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
so O
there's O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
staff. O

Must O
be O
possible O
with O
three O
tables O
and O
yet O
the O
controls B-TARGET
didn't O
really O
run O
smoothly. O

First O
course, O
half B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
lobster, I-TARGET
was O
fine. O

Main O
course, O
the O
steak, B-TARGET
very O
solid. O

Dessert B-TARGET
was O
nothing. O

Eventually O
with O
everything O
on O
and O
off, O
yet O
pricey. O

A O
lady O
and O
a O
gentleman O
took O
care O
of O
the O
service. O

The O
lady B-TARGET
was O
fine, O
the O
gentleman B-TARGET
was O
rather O
forced. O

Taken O
a O
lunch O
menu, O
it O
was O
Friday O
afternoon. O

Price/quality O
quite O
fine. O

But O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time... O

From O
12:15 O
p.m. O
to O
3:15 O
p.m., O
so O
three O
hours, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
is O
out O
of O
proportion O
to O
a O
lunch O
menu. O

It's O
a O
good O
thing O
we O
went O
there O
once, O
but O
that's O
all O
we O
need. O

Gastronomically O
delicious O
eaten O
in O
beautiful O
old O
mansion. B-TARGET

Nice O
set O
tables. B-TARGET

Control B-TARGET
at O
level. O

Choice B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
price-quality O
very O
good. O

Highly O
recommended. O

We O
had O
lunch O
for O
19 O
euros. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
was O
good. O

The O
paddle B-TARGET
that O
followed O
was O
only O
very O
moderate: O
small O
and O
a O
little O
too O
hard O
baked O
and O
for O
both O
of O
us O
we O
got O
one O
very O
small O
portion O
of O
fries. B-TARGET

Asking O
was O
possible O
but O
after O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
had O
already O
passed O
10 O
times O
without O
looking O
up O
so O
we O
finally O
got O
them O
if O
the O
rest O
of O
our O
plate O
was O
already O
empty. O

As O
dessert O
we O
had O
a O
Dame B-TARGET
Blanche: I-TARGET
a O
ball O
of O
half O
melted O
ice O
cream O
with O
wax O
chocolate O
sauce O
and O
a O
large O
portion O
of O
cream B-TARGET
fraiche I-TARGET
from O
the O
spray O
can, O
served O
in O
a O
glass. O

A O
dessert B-TARGET
of O
a O
lunch O
doesn't O
have O
to O
be O
big O
but O
serve O
nicer O
and O
preferably O
not O
in O
a O
glass O
would O
help O
a O
lot. O

We O
come O
here O
very O
regularly O
and O
do O
not O
understand O
all O
the O
negative O
comments! O

But O
yes O
that's O
the O
time O
we O
live O
in, O
people O
have O
0 O
patience O
and O
are O
quickly O
rude... O
thinking O
that O
a O
waiter O
is O
their O
slave O
that O
should O
jump O
if O
they O
snap O
their O
fingers! O

Pathetic O
people O
I O
call O
this. O

Wouldn't O
mind O
seeing O
them O
do O
it O
themselves. O

At O
New B-TARGET
Havana I-TARGET
too O
knokke, O
one O
can O
eat O
well, O
yes O
prices O
are O
a O
bit O
higher O
but O
uh... O
that O
money O
for O
so O
much O
Knokke. O

So O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
be O
in O
Knokke O
for O
that. O

We O
are O
always O
well O
served, O
and O
enjoy O
a O
drink B-TARGET
or O
good O
food. B-TARGET

So O
we O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
nonsense O
in O
the O
P O
magazine O
either. O

Let O
alone O
the O
nonsense O
of O
"Chief O
Bellings" O
ahum... O

Top O
chef O
on O
doping O
busted. O

What O
a O
reference. O

People O
go O
and O
look O
in O
front O
of O
you. O

One O
can O
never O
do O
good O
for O
everyone. O

We O
can O
recommend O
it O
all O
since O
certainly. O

We O
go O
there O
every O
time O
we O
get O
to O
the O
sea! O

But O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
before O
they O
come! O

Pancakes B-TARGET
are O
good! O

But O
the O
chocolate B-TARGET
milk I-TARGET
is O
not O
homemade! O

For O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
there, O
I O
think O
you O
can O
get O
a O
homemade O
one! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
okay! O
(you O
can O
see O
who!) O

Good O
but O
not O
gorgeous! O

It's O
raining O
inside O
the O
terrace! B-TARGET

This O
is O
the O
dirtiest, O
worst O
restaurant B-TARGET
ever O
visited O
and O
we O
visit O
many O
a O
year. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
took O
them O
out O
of O
the O
adams O
family. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
spoiled. O

Close O
that O
trade B-TARGET

Carla O
& O
Roland O

Also O
this O
year O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
fireworks O
festival O
to O
go O
back O
to O
years O
of O
tradition O
at O
Wim's O
dinner. O

We O
knew O
we O
had O
to O
make O
reservations O
during O
the O
weekend, O
and O
our O
table O
with O
sea O
view O
('t O
is O
to O
say O
on O
the O
3 O
rows O
of O
beach O
cabins) O
was O
waiting O
for O
us. O

Whoever O
didn't O
have O
to O
make O
a O
reservation O
didn't O
come O
in. O

And O
we O
enjoyed O
again O
the O
glories O
that O
the O
sea O
had O
to O
offer. O

This O
is O
and O
remains O
for O
years O
one O
of O
the O
better O
addresses O
on O
the O
sea O
dike O
of O
Knokke-Heist. O

And O
if O
we're O
around O
next O
year O
or O
sooner, O
we'd O
love O
to O
come O
back. O

Very O
good O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
sea O
view. O

We O
were O
well O
received O
by O
the O
owner B-TARGET
who O
is O
clearly O
better O
surrounded O
than O
before. O

The O
selection B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
of O
excellent O
quality. O

We O
took O
the O
grilled O
mussels O
with O
herbal O
butter O
and O
smoked O
salmon O
as O
an O
appetizer. O

Then O
came O
a O
generous O
portion O
of O
cod B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
young I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mousseline. I-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
can O
be O
better O
finished, O
but O
that's O
a O
detail. O

Big O
family B-TARGET
business I-TARGET
on O
the O
coast. O

It's O
just O
as O
good. O

In O
the O
meantime, O
we O
have O
become O
regular O
customers. O

Everything O
super O
fresh O
and O
sublimely O
prepared. O

Choose O
from O
different O
starters, B-TARGET
main I-TARGET
courses I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
desserts I-TARGET
for O
a O
correct O
price. O

Attentive O
and O
friendly O
operation B-TARGET
in O
fun O
setting. B-TARGET

In O
other O
words, O
highly O
recommended! O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Have O
taken O
menu O
with O
wine O
including, O
choice O
of O
5 O
appetizers O
and O
5 O
main O
dishes. O

Very O
tasty O
and O
this O
for O
a O
normal O
price! O

2 O
lunch B-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
with O
wide O
choice O
for O
starters O
and O
main O
courses O
at O
a O
correct O
price. O

In O
addition, O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
operation. B-TARGET

Came O
here O
earlier O
and O
always O
come O
back O
with O
pleasure. O

Pre-booking O
is O
recommended. O

It's O
a O
quiet O
and O
bloody O
day O
in O
September. O

A O
bunch O
of O
douchebags O
do O
the O
controls. B-TARGET

As O
ex-horeca O
people, O
our O
hearts O
hurt O
when O
we O
see O
how O
much O
money O
stays O
on O
the O
streets O
/ O
stays O
in O
the O
pockets O
of O
customers. O

Running O
customers O
who O
have O
to O
wait O
to O
give O
up O
their O
order O
is O
rule O
1, O
abandoned O
tables O
that O
are O
but O
uncleared O
rule O
2 O
and O
the O
biggest O
sin O
in O
the O
catering O
industry O
walk O
back O
and O
forth O
empty-handed O
rule O
3. O

As O
a O
result, O
it O
is O
a O
long O
wait O
before O
you O
can O
order, O
long O
wait O
until O
you O
are O
served O
and O
after O
ordering O
a O
meal O
is O
almost O
impossible. O

But O
we O
did O
it! O

We O
got O
moderate O
food B-TARGET
at O
Knokke O
prices, O
which O
because O
the O
casino O
is O
next O
to O
it O
had O
gone O
further O
over O
the O
head. O

Afterwards O
we O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom, B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
recommended. O

The O
rancid O
sewer O
air O
hits O
your O
throat O
and O
almost O
makes O
you O
vomit. O

No, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
won't O
have O
a O
long O
life. O

We O
have O
known O
the O
Lodge O
for O
several O
years O
and O
often O
visit O
(Diest, O
Aarschot, O
Zolder O
and O
Knokke). O

This O
time O
was O
both O
food, B-TARGET
service B-TARGET
and O
restaurant B-TARGET
substandard!!!! O

We O
took O
shrimp B-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
where O
you O
were O
supposed O
to O
look O
for O
the O
shrimp. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
that O
was O
served O
there O
was O
also O
not O
fresh O
anymore O
and O
thrown O
on O
it, O
fried B-TARGET
parsley I-TARGET
was O
also O
of O
moderate O
level! O

The O
butter B-TARGET
that O
was O
served O
at O
our O
sea O
sole O
was O
full O
of O
burnt O
pieces:-(. O

We O
sat O
outside O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
which O
was O
ok O
(though O
no O
table O
wipes O
although O
we O
had O
reserved). O

When O
you O
went O
to O
the O
bathroom, O
the O
smell O
already O
came O
to O
you, O
as O
if O
there O
had O
been O
no O
cleaning O
for O
days! O

Also O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
were O
the O
packets O
of O
butter O
and O
bread O
on O
the O
ground O
of O
the O
service O
table. O
(may O
have O
been O
that O
it O
was O
busy O
but O
picking O
up O
something O
like O
this O
takes O
absolutely O
no O
time). O

There O
were O
3 O
waitress B-TARGET
present O
and O
it O
was O
certainly O
not O
busy, O
they O
had O
time O
to O
talk O
to O
each O
other O
so O
one O
could O
easily O
have O
cleared O
a O
little O
"debris"! O

Moreover, O
one O
of O
the O
clerks B-TARGET
didn't O
speak O
a O
word O
of O
Dutch O
or O
French!? O

This O
is O
NOT O
the O
service B-TARGET
we O
know O
from O
the O
other O
Lodge O
it O
was O
really O
undersized!!!! O

Fireworks O
festival O
- O
few O
restaurants, O
so O
first O
take O
where O
there O
is O
place. O

When O
we O
asked O
if O
there O
was O
room, O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
wanted O
to O
help O
us, O
but O
this O
one O
was O
brutally O
pulled O
away O
by O
another O
waiter O
and O
left O
us O
standing. O

We O
then O
sat O
down O
and O
were O
"helped" O
by O
an O
rude O
(old O
man B-TARGET
with O
gray O
hair) O
(= O
I O
will O
come O
back O
when O
I O
have O
time). O

After O
finally O
ordering, O
we O
saw O
waiters B-TARGET
clunging O
(searching O
for O
the O
right O
tables), O
the O
old O
gray O
man O
was O
insulting O
everyone,....... O

We've O
seen O
at O
least O
16 O
tables O
run O
away O
because O
they O
weren't O
served. O

After O
dinner O
we O
asked O
the O
old O
man B-TARGET
a O
coffee O
and O
his O
answer O
was: O
'no!!!, O
I O
go O
first O
to O
clear O
all O
the O
tables O
(a O
lot) O
and O
then O
I O
come O
back. O

We O
replied O
to O
this O
and O
said O
it O
extra O
loudly O
what O
we O
thought O
of O
the O
service. O

Then O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
back: O
'I O
want O
to O
apologize O
with O
2 O
free O
coffees O
(we O
had O
ordered O
3), O
but O
if O
you O
don't O
like O
it O
you O
should O
put O
on O
an O
apron O
yourself O
'SPECIAL O
EXCUUS!!!! O

At O
that O
time O
all O
the O
tables O
around O
us, O
which O
were O
not O
served, O
left O
and O
told O
him O
to O
find O
another O
job. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
nice O
but O
due O
to O
the O
clumsiness O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
(look O
for O
minutes O
for O
the O
right O
table), O
the O
sauce O
was O
cold!!!! O

Here O
I O
never O
come O
back O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
(old O
man O
with O
gray O
hair) O
will O
be O
fired. O

Because O
how O
he O
reacted O
to O
the O
customers O
was O
outrageous! O

Especially O
at O
that O
price. O

If O
there O
were O
other O
restaurants O
available, O
we O
would O
have O
left O
right O
away. O

But, O
yes, O
you O
must O
eat... O

This O
restaurant O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
list O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Ypres. O

However, O
I O
cannot O
imagine O
that O
there O
are O
no O
better O
restaurants O
in O
Ypres. O

Don't O
get O
me O
wrong, O
it's O
not O
bad, O
but O
it's O
not O
great O
either. O

There O
are O
5 O
ladies B-TARGET
to O
serve, O
but O
when O
we O
came O
in O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
ask O
if O
there O
was O
another O
table O
available. O

Later O
in O
the O
evening, O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
finished O
her O
work O
and O
started O
picking O
out O
the O
food O
residue O
between O
her O
teeth. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
just O
good, O
but O
no O
more O
than O
that. O

There O
were O
three O
of O
us O
who O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal O
at O
Capella's. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly, O
correct, O
helpful O
and O
very O
pleasant. O

We O
all O
had O
a O
3 B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
which O
was O
really O
delicious. O

I O
ordered O
a O
wine B-TARGET
package, I-TARGET
which O
was O
also O
good. O

As O
a O
tip, O
a O
dessert O
wine O
could O
also O
be O
served O
at O
dessert, O
where O
everything O
was O
fine O
for O
each O
other. O

Price/quality O
can O
hardly O
be O
better! O

We O
have O
already O
started O
eating O
several O
times O
here, O
or O
at O
least O
tried, O
with O
varying O
success. O

After O
waiting O
several O
times O
for O
our O
food O
(+45min!!!), O
we O
ordered O
the O
last O
time O
videe O
and O
stew. O

Even O
this O
took O
half O
an O
hour. O

The O
name O
restaurant O
is O
not O
worthy, O
serving O
only O
vacuum O
meals O
and O
service B-TARGET
is O
therefore O
substandard. O

The O
garden O
could O
be O
nice O
if O
the O
grass O
was O
mowed O
once, O
the O
terrace O
even O
more O
fun O
if O
the O
tables O
were O
clean O
and O
it O
would O
make O
Tienen O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
richer O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
waiting O
times O
respectable. O

If O
I O
were O
to O
deal O
with O
customers O
like O
that O
at O
work, O
my O
C4 O
would O
be O
there O
soon! O

The O
garden B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
but O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
for O
you O
to O
eat B-TARGET
and O
it O
is O
only O
moderate O
in O
quality. O

If O
you O
just O
want O
a O
drink O
it's O
recommended O
because O
the O
garden O
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
you O
shouldn't O
wait O
long O
for O
the O
drink O

Very O
nice O
is O
the O
garden B-TARGET
outside, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
also O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
outside O
is O
very O
chaotic O
with O
its O
moments. O

Inside, O
it's O
smoother. O

For O
the O
third O
time O
this O
year O
we O
have O
already O
enjoyed: O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
still O
magical, O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
stylish O
and O
enthusiastic O
everywhere O
present, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
flawless, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
choice I-TARGET
of O
the O
sommelier O
is O
sublime. O

More O
we O
don't O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
- O
let O
yourself O
be O
surprised O
by O
the O
paintings O
on O
your O
plate, O
almost O
too O
nice O
to O
eat O
but O
do O
it O
anyway O
- O
and O
enjoy O
the O
taste B-TARGET
sensations! I-TARGET

Our O
next O
reservation O
is O
already O
in O
place... O

From O
the O
amuse B-TARGET
gueule I-TARGET
to O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
the O
incredible O
enjoyment O
of O
all O
those O
flavors. O

The O
reception O
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
friendly O
and O
cared O
for. O

Of O
course O
pm080 O
is O
absolutely O
right, O
yet O
she O
has O
forgotten O
something. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
Stijn I-TARGET
also O
speaks O
Polish, O
which O
sometimes O
comes O
well O
from O
ps. O

Fair O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
best O
suited O
for O
(clear) O
self-being O
but O
not O
directly O
the O
ideal O
opportunity O
for O
a O
romantic O
tête O
à O
tête O
with O
your O
loved O
one; O
a O
little O
no-nonsense O
and O
quite O
fun, O
besides O
a O
spacious O
map B-TARGET
and O
certainly O
more O
than O
average O
tasty O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
a O
nice O
concept, O
a O
warm O
decor B-TARGET
and O
is O
not O
touristy O
located. O

However, O
more O
customers O
are O
allowed O
in O
the O
restaurant O
than O
the O
service B-TARGET
can O
handle. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
who O
takes O
the O
lead O
over O
the O
room O
and/or O
keeps O
the O
overview. O

The O
regular O
service O
is O
supplemented O
by O
student B-TARGET
(s) I-TARGET
who O
mainly O
walk O
back O
and O
forth O
with O
nothing O
or O
one O
thing O
in O
their O
hand. O

-friendly O
reception B-TARGET
and O
aperitif O
at O
the O
bar O
(then O
only O
1/3 O
of O
the O
guests O
were O
present) O

- O
ice B-TARGET
cubes I-TARGET
and O
garnitures B-TARGET
are O
taken O
unhygienic O
with O
the O
bare O
hand. O

-no O
list O
or O
wine O
list O
is O
offered O
at O
the O
table. O

-after O
a O
second O
question O
comes O
the O
-original- O
wine B-TARGET
list. I-TARGET

-Ordering O
wine O
is O
difficult, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
says O
she O
doesn't O
have O
time O
and O
she'll O
be O
back O
soon, O
but O
she O
forgets O
this. O

After O
a O
while O
we O
address O
another O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
does O
have O
time O
to O
remember O
the O
two O
words O
needed O
to O
make O
our O
choice. O

The O
snack O
was O
already O
cleared O
and O
the O
appetizer O
was O
except O
for O
one O
bite O
when O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
bottle O
of O
tasty O
Pouilly B-TARGET
Fuissé I-TARGET
on O
the O
table. O

Since O
we O
had O
taken O
the O
aperitif O
at O
the O
bar O
we O
were O
'dry' O
all O
this O
time. O

- O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
had O
no O
time O
to O
eat O
fries O
at O
the O
table O
where O
a O
relative O
of O
hers O
sat O
as O
a O
customer. O

- O
The O
appetizer B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
sour. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
good. O

-the O
starter, O
extra B-TARGET
soft I-TARGET
smoked I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
was O
standard O
quality O
wholesale. O

The O
fat O
seam O
near O
the O
tail O
of O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
that O
becomes O
hard O
when O
smoking O
was O
not O
cut O
away O
by O
the O
kitchen. O

- O
the O
fondue B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
fries B-TARGET
fresh, O
the O
sauces B-TARGET
industrial. O

-We O
are O
asked O
if O
there O
should O
be O
some O
fries, O
which O
will O
soon O
be O
followed O
by O
a O
bowl. O

-A O
little O
later O
we O
are O
asked O
whether O
there O
may O
be O
some O
meat; O
'we O
would O
like O
to O
answer; O
'half O
a O
plate O
suffices' O

- O
17 O
minutes O
later, O
the O
waitress O
arrives O
to O
clean O
up. O

"We're O
still O
waiting O
for O
meat," O
we O
replied. O

After O
which O
a O
communication O
via O
someone O
else O
from O
the O
ministry O
a O
second O
time O
goes O
to O
the O
kitchen. O

Nonchalance O
of O
the O
kitchen O
or O
an O
unclear O
order O
17 O
minutes O
earlier O
from O
the O
service O
to O
the O
kitchen? O

The O
chief O
shoots O
himself O
at O
his O
cutting O
machine O
and O
the O
meat O
follows. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
of O
course O
cold O
by O
now, O
but O
we O
don't O
ask O
for O
any O
warm O
ones O
anymore, O
who O
knows O
when O
we'll O
get O
them. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
overmanned O
compared O
to O
the O
hall. O

The O
room B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
left O
to O
their O
fate: O
pumping O
or O
drowning. O

The O
stress O
of O
the O
room B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
and O
the O
unnecessary O
(inefficient) O
busy O
running O
back O
and O
forth O
radiates O
on O
the O
customers O
and O
determines O
the O
atmosphere O
in O
the O
business. B-TARGET

Enjoying O
is O
hard O
here. O

The O
acoustics B-TARGET
are O
a O
tricky O
point. O

From O
a O
small O
customer O
occupation O
you O
already O
have O
to O
raise O
your O
voice O
in O
order O
to O
have O
a O
clear O
conversation O
with O
your O
partner. O

An O
acoustic O
ceiling, O
3D O
tiles, O
as O
a O
solution? O

If O
there O
are O
several O
washes O
during O
the O
service O
and O
they O
are O
then O
thrown O
back O
into O
the O
right O
compartments O
and O
all O
dishes O
are O
stacked O
softly O
together O
then O
this O
all O
makes O
unnecessary O
noise O
throughout O
the O
entire O
room. O

In O
the O
absence O
of O
an O
e-mail O
address O
on O
the O
website, O
I O
cannot O
pass O
on O
this O
feedback O
directly O
to O
the O
owner, O
but O
should O
post O
them O
here... O

When O
entering O
this O
restaurant, O
I O
was O
addressed O
in O
French. O

When O
I O
asked O
if O
they O
spoke O
Dutch, O
the O
answer O
was O
'non'. O

So O
my O
hunger O
was O
over O
and O
I O
turned O
around. O

I O
read O
the O
negative O
reviews O
on O
Tripadvisor O
when O
we O
were O
already O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
restaurant O
Holiday O
and O
was O
a O
bit O
afraid O
of O
what O
would O
come... O

Eventually O
I O
was O
gladly O
surprised, O
we O
have O
had O
a O
nice O
service O
of O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
ok, O
I O
took O
the O
fish B-TARGET
suggestion I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
day I-TARGET
and O
this O
was O
a O
correct O
dish O
for O
a O
correct O
price. O

No O
culinary O
delights O
but O
for O
that O
you O
have O
other O
establishments O
in O
Nieuwpoort. O

I O
therefore O
find O
the O
negative O
criticisms O
very O
exaggerated! O

We O
both O
ate O
pizza B-TARGET
frutti I-TARGET
di I-TARGET
mare I-TARGET
and O
this O
one O
was O
best O
ok O
in O
terms O
of O
price/quality. O

Lots O
of O
cheese, B-TARGET
no O
dried O
crust B-TARGET
as O
you O
often O
find, O
actually O
quite O
airy. O

At O
the O
ministry, B-TARGET
however, O
there O
was O
someone O
who O
couldn't O
hear O
a O
word O
of O
Dutch, O
I O
don't O
think O
Nieuwpoort O
can O
do O
that O
at O
all. O

We O
asked O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
olives O
at O
our O
aperitif, O
but O
that O
was O
not O
possible. O

With O
almost O
every O
Italian O
you O
get O
this O
standard O
on O
the O
table! O

So O
not O
here... O

But O
what O
we O
got O
was O
good. O

The O
Court B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Heusden I-TARGET
is O
in O
itself O
what O
a O
special O
location. O

It O
does O
indeed O
seem O
more O
like O
a O
café O
when O
entering O
-and O
so O
is O
it O
because O
you O
can O
just O
drink O
or O
eat O
something O
there. O

But O
in O
the O
back O
is O
the O
restaurant. O

And O
at O
the O
restaurant O
is O
a O
large O
terrace. O

So O
walk O
through O
the O
café O
to O
the O
restaurant. O

And O
that's O
nicely O
decorated! O

Abdel B-TARGET
is O
great: O
he O
cooks O
very O
nicely O
and O
we O
especially O
think O
that O
he O
is O
a O
master O
in O
preparing O
game. O

So O
in O
the O
wild O
season: O
all O
there! O

In O
summer O
there O
is O
a O
large O
terrace-with O
a O
garden. O

We O
love O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
especially O
because O
of O
Abdel's B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
and O
kindness. O

And O
we O
especially O
like O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
winter O
months! O

Month O
menu: O
The O
'gourmet B-TARGET
sign' I-TARGET
consisted O
of O
a O
toast O
of O
1 O
square O
centimetre O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
pate O
on O
it O
and O
something O
similar O
to O
onion O
canopy. O

The O
butter B-TARGET
we O
got O
with O
the O
3 O
pieces O
of O
bread O
(for O
2 O
people) O
had O
the O
expiration O
date O
12/12/13 O
(almost O
one O
month O
by O
date) O

The O
carpacio B-TARGET
(tataki O
on O
the O
menu) O
was O
watery O
and O
inspirationless. O

The O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
(pig O
cheeks) O
was O
good. O

The O
wines B-TARGET
can O
only O
be O
ordered O
per O
glass O
or O
per O
half O
liter??? O
except O
the O
house O
wine.. O

It O
could O
be O
ordered O
by O
bottle. O

So O
I'm O
assuming O
the O
"better O
wines" O
come O
from O
a O
barrel? O

The O
room O
was O
full O
of O
people O
who O
came O
to O
eat O
with O
the O
Grouponbon. O

Their O
menu, O
which O
cost O
about O
half O
of O
ours, O
certainly O
looked O
much O
better. O

The O
case O
lacks O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
we O
have O
absolutely O
no O
good O
feeling O
after O
this O
dinner. O

There O
are O
many O
restos O
in O
Destelbergen O
and O
Heusden O
with O
a O
much O
better O
price-quality O
ratio. O

There's O
still O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
to O
be O
done. O

We O
picked O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
Groupon O
ticket. O

But O
we O
were O
disappointed O
upon O
arrival. O

It O
was O
exactly O
a O
café O
where O
you O
go O
for O
a O
drink O
and O
it O
was O
definitely O
not O
romantic. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
nice O
and O
nicely O
presented O
on O
the O
plate. O

But O
there O
couldn't O
be O
a O
smile O
off O
the O
staff B-TARGET
either. O

Five O
times O
I O
have O
visited O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
never O
had O
a O
disappointment. O

(or O
else O
you O
won't O
come O
back) O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
always O
welcoming O
and O
price/quality O
is O
excellent. O

This O
weekend O
enjoyed O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
grafted O
on O
the O
wild O
season. O

The O
amuse B-TARGET
is O
already O
surprising O
and O
a O
harbinger O
of O
a O
promising O
menu. O

Carpaccio B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
boar, I-TARGET
partridge B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
beet I-TARGET
& O
forest O
mushrooms O
are O
all O
surprising O
combinations. O

Take O
a O
close O
with O
vanilla O
ice O
cream O
and O
blueberries O
and O
the O
evening O
can O
no O
longer O
be O
broken. O

5 O
courses O
for O
45.00 O
euros O
is O
a O
fair O
price O
for O
an O
excellent O
menu. B-TARGET

Reservations O
with O
the O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
were O
always O
successful. O

Agreed O
that O
a O
juicy O
box O
for O
the O
little O
ones O
might O
be O
a O
bit O
fast-foody O
but O
they O
just O
like O
it. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
top O
but O
young O
talent O
deserves O
and O
backup. O

We O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
regularly O
because O
you O
will O
find O
the O
best O
pizza B-TARGET
in O
the O
region. O

Mateo B-TARGET
was O
chosen O
best O
pizza O
baker O
of O
East O
Flanders O
for O
a O
reason. O

In O
addition, O
we O
love O
the O
cozy O
family O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

There O
is O
an O
excellent O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
that O
is O
regularly O
renewed. O

The O
regular O
menu B-TARGET
also O
has O
regular O
variety. O

However, O
we O
try O
to O
avoid O
the O
weekend O
because O
then O
it O
can O
be O
quite O
busy. O

Everyone O
is O
showing O
off O
to O
please O
the O
customers, O
but O
they O
can't O
do O
more O
than O
humanly O
possible. O

Victim O
of O
one's O
own O
success O
could O
be O
said. O

Reservation O
and O
information O
is O
therefore O
the O
message. O

Nothing O
cordial, O
friendly! O

Just O
rude O
ministry. B-TARGET

Like O
everything O
was O
against O
her O
will. O

I O
hope O
this O
was O
a O
snapshot O
(bad O
day) O

At O
least O
we'll O
never O
come O
back O
here. O

The O
food B-TARGET
wasn't O
bad, O
but O
it O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
the O
hostess' B-TARGET
rudeness. O

Plenty O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Destelbergen O
where O
they O
don't O
work O
against O
their O
will. O

At O
first O
my O
friend O
and O
I O
had O
some O
"threshold O
fear" O
to O
come O
in O
here, O
as O
the O
interior B-TARGET
looked O
a O
bit O
messy. O

But O
we O
overcome O
our O
fear O
and O
got O
the O
surprise O
of O
our O
lives! O

We O
were O
warmly O
welcomed O
and O
immediately O
felt O
at O
home O
in O
this O
friendly, O
family O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Not O
at O
all O
fancy O
or O
anything, O
rather O
simple, O
you O
think O
you're O
in O
an O
Italian O
living O
room... O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
never O
did O
I O
feel O
Italy O
as O
close O
as O
in O
the O
Etna. B-TARGET

The O
chef B-TARGET
has O
won O
prizes O
for O
"best O
pizzaiolo O
of O
Flanders' O
and O
is O
very O
proud O
of O
this. O

The O
pictures O
and O
certificates O
are O
on O
the O
wall. O

So O
far O
my O
best O
experience O
with O
authentic O
Italian O
cuisine O
in O
our O
Belgian O
country. O

The O
price O
is O
also O
very O
reasonable. O

I'll O
come O
back O
here O
again, O
for O
sure!!!! O

Super O
tasty O
pastas B-TARGET
and O
pizzas B-TARGET
eaten! O

The O
cook, O
Mateo O
is O
an O
Italian. O

Happy O
reception, B-TARGET
good O
to O
book O
in O
advance. O

price O
is O
average. O

Also O
the O
formula B-TARGET
'pizza I-TARGET
party' I-TARGET
is O
a O
bull's-eye!! O

In O
summer O
large O
sun B-TARGET
terrace. I-TARGET

I O
asked O
for O
a O
steak B-TARGET
signant, I-TARGET
but O
this O
one O
was O
medium O
to O
bien O
cuit. O

If O
I O
made O
a O
comment O
on O
this, O
I O
would O
just O
get O
the O
same O
meat O
back O
saying O
that O
I O
was O
wrong. O

For O
the O
rest, O
little O
creative O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Not O
recommended. O

Sunday O
30 O
March, O
beautiful O
weather O
so O
terrace O
on O
the O
way: O
Quite O
a O
lot O
of O
customers O
and O
enough O
staff B-TARGET
who O
were O
not O
interested O
in O
serving O
the O
people. O

We O
have O
spent O
half O
an O
hour O
there O
trying O
to O
attract O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
who O
wandered O
by O
without O
taking O
an O
important O
order. O

In O
the O
end, O
we O
left O
hungry O
and O
thirsty. O

Such O
a O
rude O
and O
uninterested O
service B-TARGET
I O
have O
experienced O
even O
more O
nervous. O

Just O
incomprehensible. O

They'll O
never O
see O
us O
there O
again. O

"The O
youngest O
"has O
as O
its O
main O
asset O
the O
beautiful O
garden B-TARGET
where O
it O
is O
good O
for O
families O
with O
children O
and O
larger O
groups, O
were O
it O
not O
that O
the O
current O
management O
changed O
the O
concept O
drastically. O

On O
Sunday O
afternoon O
there O
is O
"animation" O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
"dinner O
show," O
an O
arrangement O
that O
costs O
€70,- O
but O
then O
you O
get O
entertainment O
from O
schlagergods O
à O
la O
Frank O
Galan, O
Danny O
Fabri, O
Paul O
Severs O
and O
tutti O
quantumi. O

Only O
suitable O
for O
a O
limited O
niche O
audience. O

We O
thought O
to O
eat O
something O
in O
the O
garden B-TARGET
(then O
you O
pay O
the O
€70,- O
not O
and O
you O
can O
only O
order O
from O
the O
snacks O
card) O
but O
also O
there O
the O
decibels O
are O
generously O
steered O
in O
your O
direction O
(poor O
neighbors!). O

We O
have O
eaten O
quickly O
and O
without O
taste O
and O
have O
made O
that O
we O
were O
gone O
again. O

Do O
you O
like O
Flemish O
and O
other O
schlagers: O
go O
for O
it, O
don't O
pay O
€70,- O
and O
put O
yourself O
in O
the O
garden; O
don't O
like O
it, O
just O
stay O
away. O

The O
new O
building O
looks O
like O
a O
public O
pool O
or O
gymnasium. O

How O
is O
it O
possible O
to O
renew O
a O
matter O
of O
tradition O
and O
nostalgia O
in O
such O
a O
terrible O
way! O

Cosiness O
is O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go O
here! O

You O
can O
quietly O
eat O
and O
drink O
something O
here, O
the O
prices O
are O
slightly O
higher O
than O
normal O
but O
you O
will O
get O
value O
for O
money. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
playground O
for O
the O
children O
and O
in O
the O
summer O
it O
is O
also O
very O
nice O
to O
stay O
here. O

No O
problem O
getting O
a O
meal O
at O
this O
restaurant/café O
around O
9:30 O
pm. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
smooth O
and O
happened O
quickly. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
room O
to O
sit O
in O
this O
establishment, O
yet O
one O
manages O
to O
get O
almost O
all O
places O
occupied O
even O
on O
a O
weekday. O

Breakfast B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
again! O

Excellent O
organization, B-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
variation, O
something O
for O
everyone. O

Friendly O
service, B-TARGET
cozy O
interior B-TARGET
and O
all O
that O
in O
a O
beautiful O
green O
location. B-TARGET

We'd O
love O
to O
come O
back! O

Very O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
fantastic O
setting B-TARGET
in O
the O
woods, O
ideal O
as O
a O
bike O
stop O
where O
the O
good O

is, O

also O
the O
effort O
to O
just O
have O
a O

on O
the O

next O
to O

Super O
friendly O
hostess! B-TARGET

Fantastic O
food! B-TARGET

A O
real O
flavor O
festival! O

So O
far O
no O
other O
restaurant O
has O
been O
found O
that O
can O
match O
this! O

Unfriendly O
people B-TARGET
-blast O
crazy O
-worst O
food B-TARGET
ever O
-don't O
go O
there!!!! O

And O
then O
the O
people O
in O
the O
hospitality O
industry O
complain... O

in O
the O
context O
of O
a O
flairbon O
we O
have O
reserved O
at O
"de O
mein" O
the O
soup B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
asparagus I-TARGET
was O
tasty O
but O
no O
bread, O
butter O
served. O

the O
beef B-TARGET
brochette I-TARGET
was O
rained O
and O
tough O
(all O
5 O
cubes O
on O
the O
spear) O
and O
ate O
like O
a O
chewing O
gum. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
(salm) O
ate O
nicely, O
but O
table O
next O
to O
us O
asked O
a O
little O
butter O
sauce O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
replied: O
"Sauce O
is O
up. O

At O
the O
third B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
crème O
rollée O
in O
the O
offer O
while O
this O
was O
given O
in O
the O
voucher. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
decaf O
coffee O

You O
guessed O
the O
answer: O
"Isn't O
there?" O

The O
night O
that O
followed O
it O
was O
hell. O

My O
wife O
throws O
up O
all O
night O
and O
diarrhea. O

So O
final O
conclusion: O
still O
overpaid O
and O
entered O
at O
6:00 O
p.m. O
sharp O
and O
left O
at O
9:15 O
p.m. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
also O
not O
overly O
friendly O
and O
free O
steering... O

After O
unfamiliar O
reservation O
(according O
to O
vivabox) O
they O
never O
wanted O
to O
serve O
us, O
and O
wait O
after O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half. O

Congratulations O
and O
success O
in O
the O
future.. O

Quite O
outrageous O
what O
they O
serve. O

It's O
the O
worst O
food O
I've O
ever O
had. O

Got O
steppe B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
that O
stabbed O
tss O
grill O
for O
a O
while. O

Doesn't O
even O
qualify O
for O
fry. O

Just O
stop O
this. O

In O
my O
opinion O
there O
was O
reserved O
for O
lunch O
outside O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
inside O
a O
separate O
room. O

It O
was O
very O
loud O
and O
noisy. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
fine O
but O
I O
would O
prefer O
a O
more O
enjoyable O
atmosphere B-TARGET
on O
a O
beautiful O
spring O
day........... O

Pre-arranged O
menu O
for O
a O
group O
of O
10 O
people. O

Correct O
price O
for O
a O
3-course B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
(each O
fish O
or O
meat), O
including O
drinks O
and O
aperitif. O

Quality O
certainly O
in O
order, O
to O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
the O
participants. O

Thanks! O

Through O
acquaintances O
we O
had O
been O
advised O
to O
sit O
down O
here. O

We O
went O
here O
to O
eat O
the O
night O
before O
Valentine's O
Day. O

There O
was O
just O
a O
table O
of O
2 O
free O
and O
ordered O
the O
Valentine's O
Day O
menu. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
really O
delicious O
and O
immediately O
knew O
that O
we O
should O
actually O
come O
here O
more O
often. O

Really O
recommended O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
dinner. O

In O
addition, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
there O
was O
a O
nice O
gift O
for O
the O
attention O
of O
valentine. O

Reserve O
a O
hopeless O
cause. O

2x O
reserved, O
2x O
not O
on O
the O
list!!!! O

Confirmation O
email O
from O
Social O
Deal O
shown, O
come, O
give, O
and O
sit O
down! O

Welcome! O

Forget O
it... O

1/2 O
hours O
waiting O
for O
first O
tapas. O

Wasn't O
too O
bad, O
but O
serrano B-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
baguette I-TARGET
can't O
be O
too O
bad. O

Another O
1/2 O
hour O
waiting O
for O
another O
miniscule O
portion. B-TARGET

Tapas O
eat O
as O
much... O
as O
you O
like?? O

They O
decide O
how O
much O
you O
eat, O
if O
you're O
lucky O
you O
get O
4x3 O
portions, O
if O
they O
don't O
feel O
like O
it, O
you'll O
have O
to O
do O
it O
with O
less! O

Server B-TARGET
did O
her O
best, O
but O
the O
boss O
(?) O
is O
allowed O
to O
take O
a O
course O
reception, O
bah O
bah. O

Can't'so-called' O
good O
Dutch, O
What O
a O
laugh, O
was O
complaining O
against O
acquaintances O
about O
Social O
Deal O
and O
the O
influx O
of O
guests O
who O
brought O
this O
formula, O
in O
perfect O
Dutch... O

One O
year O
now, O
I O
wonder O
what O
it O
looks O
like O
next O
year. O

Don't O
think O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
are O
going O
for O
a O
second O
time, O
which O
is O
the O
ultimate O
goal. O

Missed O
opportunity, O
too O
bad, O
because O
the O
cook B-TARGET
doesn't O
have O
it. O

Dinner O
with O
the O
whole O
family O
at O
19:00, O
at O
19:30 O
we O
got O
the O
drink O
card, O
at O
19:40 O
we O
had O
to O
pass O
the O
order O
for O
the O
food. O

None O
of O
the O
tapas O
we O
ordered O
came O
on O
the O
table O
at O
the O
same O
time O
and O
there O
were O
also O
some O
tapas O
that O
we O
had O
passed O
on. O

Control B-TARGET
very O
bad, O
while O
there O
wasn't O
much O
business. O

Everything O
was O
too O
much O
for O
them. O

We O
could O
have O
2 O
hours O
of O
unlimited O
tapas O
but O
at O
20.55 O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
said O
the O
kitchen O
was O
closed O
at O
9 O
p.m. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
very O
bad, O
we O
could O
have O
gone O
even O
better O
to O
a O
fry!! O

So O
not O
recommended!!!! O

The O
food B-TARGET
a O
bit O
tasty O
but O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
horrible, O
no O
explanation O
and O
with O
pain O
and O
difficulty O
can O
order O
2x O
(where O
the O
lady B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
ministry I-TARGET
also O
looked O
impatiently O
on O
her O
watch) O
if O
you O
waved/called O
on O
or O
somehow O
wanted O
to O
attract O
the O
attention O
of O
her O
she O
just O
seemed O
to O
ignore O
this. O

Too O
bad O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
to O
do! O

First O
months O
tried O
to O
book O
with O
the O
voucher O
of O
social O
deal, O
not O
possible O
via O
social O
deal O
website, O
then O
tried O
by O
phone, O
was O
very O
rudely O
barked O
off O
that O
I O
had O
to O
book O
with O
computer, O
tried O
again, O
no O
possibility, O
after O
written O
complaint O
with O
social O
deal O
then O
finally O
got O
to O
a O
reservation... O
what O
did O
we O
see O
there... O
very O
dirty, O
bad O
tastes, B-TARGET
terrible O
service, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
on O
card O
were O
suddenly O
served O
with O
other O
vegetables, O
and O
yet... O
staff B-TARGET
"sit O
or O
stand" O
there O
enough, O
but O
they O
didn't O
come O
from O
their O
place... O

NO O
MORE...!!!! O

Sunday O
with O
4 O
adults O
have O
breakfast, O
already O
for O
the O
third O
time. O

Highly O
recommended. O

We O
took O
the O
luxurious B-TARGET
breakfast I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
indeed O
luxurious. O

Very O
tasty O
sandwiches B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
cakes, I-TARGET
plenty O
of O
bread, B-TARGET
very O
tasty O
ham B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
tasty O
coffee, B-TARGET
the O
tea B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
milk I-TARGET
are O
definitely O
recommended. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
your O
breakfast O
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting. B-TARGET

We're O
definitely O
coming O
back O
to O
this O
case B-TARGET
in O
Damme. O

One O
of O
the O
few O
things O
where O
the O
client O
is O
still O
king. O

We O
had O
a O
cottage O
nearby O
without O
breakfast. O

By O
the O
reviews O
here O
on O
the O
site O
chosen O
for O
this O
case O
to O
have O
breakfast. O

And O
what O
a O
treat. O

As O
soon O
as O
your O
door O
opens, O
the O
delicious O
pastries B-TARGET
jump O
in O
front O
of O
you. O

We O
chose O
a O
luxurious B-TARGET
breakfast I-TARGET
for O
€10,-pp O
and O
what O
a O
party O
that O
was. O

Two O
sandwiches O
of O
your O
choice. O

Hard, O
soft, O
multigrain... O
name O
it. O

Also O
a O
choice B-TARGET
from O
a O
"coffee O
sandwich" O
i.e. O
a O
real O
coffee O
sandwich O
but O
also O
croissants O
(with O
or O
without O
chocolate) O
or O
other O
delicious O
sandwiches. B-TARGET

Furthermore O
a O
glass O
of B-TARGET
orange I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
(not O
fresh O
but O
still O
very O
tasty) O
coffee B-TARGET
as O
much O
as O
you O
like. O

A O
freshly O
cooked O
egg, B-TARGET
perfectly O
cooked O
as O
standard, O
slightly O
harder O
on O
request. O

The O
siege O
consists O
of O
slices O
of O
ham O
and O
cheese. O

Jam O
and O
nutella O
and O
speculos. O

All O
in O
all... O
Enough. O

More O
than O
enough. O

It O
was O
so O
good O
that O
we O
just O
came O
back O
here O
the O
2nd O
day. O

Super O
friendly O
woman B-TARGET
behind O
the O
desk O
we've O
had O
whole O
conversations O
with, O
open O
and O
honest! O

For O
the O
whole O
picture.... O

Highly O
recommended. O

Beautiful O
place B-TARGET
and O
good O
food B-TARGET

There's O
a O
quick O
service O
there. O

The O
scampies B-TARGET
doable I-TARGET
there O
are O
super O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
croquettes I-TARGET
are O
even O
better O
than O
in O
most O
restaurants O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
absolutely O
not O
recommended O
for O
a O
cozy O
evening O
out O
to O
eat. O

Since O
we O
didn't O
feel O
good O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
actually O
inappropriate O
to O
leave O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
we O
didn't O
order O
an O
appetizer. O

We O
were O
the O
only O
guests O
at O
the O
time. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
moderate, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
sat O
behind O
his O
computer O
the O
whole O
time O
after O
preparing O
the O
main O
course. O

The O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
was O
tasty. O

After O
choosing O
a O
dessert, B-TARGET
which O
was O
disappointing, O
we O
finally O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
bill O
in O
cash. O

Once O
but O
never O
again! O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
owner B-TARGET
arrogant, O
but O
he O
also O
insults O
his O
customers! O

Both O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
hotel O
can O
be O
avoided O
as O
well O
as O
the O
plague! O

In O
the O
rooms O
there O
is O
fish O
smell O
and O
kitchen O
noise. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
moderate O
and O
certainly O
not O
worth O
its O
price. O

We O
went O
here O
to O
eat O
with O
another O
couple O
and O
immediately O
chose O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
real O
Belgian. O

Tomato O
shrimp-sludges-Dame O
Blanche: O
didn't O
look O
bad. O

And O
it O
was O
certainly O
not O
bad O
when O
you O
opt O
for O
a O
café-restaurant O
somewhere O
in O
the O
center O
of O
a O
city. O

But O
if O
your O
boss O
consciously O
chooses O
a O
restaurant O
then O
the O
whole B-TARGET
could O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
refined O
and O
the O
entourage B-TARGET
a O
bit O
more O
cozy. O

A O
repeat O
of O
past O
mistakes O
in O
Oostkerke? O

The O
shrimp B-TARGET
were O
delicious, O
the O
tongue O
was O
well O
baked O
but O
for O
that O
price O
the O
presentation B-TARGET
could O
be O
a O
lot O
better. O

Now O
everything O
looked O
like O
it O
was O
and O
maybe O
it O
was, O
the O
cook B-TARGET
(patron) O
we O
saw O
regularly O
sitting O
behind O
his O
computer O
at O
a O
table O
in O
the O
restaurant O
to O
great O
annoyances O
of O
our O
partners O
who O
were O
constantly O
looking O
at O
it. O

The O
unkindness O
of O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
both O
when O
entering O
and O
during O
our O
entire O
meal O
was O
downright O
annoying O
and O
also O
the O
clasping O
of O
her O
shoes O
attracted O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
present O
customers O
so O
that O
the O
food O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
enjoyed O
relaxed. O

When O
we O
settled O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
we O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
pay O
with O
cash, O
because O
their O
plane O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
broken. O

So O
we O
go O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
a O
bank O
machine O
to O
close O
this O
less O
cozy O
evening. O

We O
don't O
dare O
bring O
friends O
here O
anymore. O

yesterday O
enjoyed O
EVERYTHING O
in O
the B-TARGET
South I-TARGET
Side. I-TARGET

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
TOP, O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
SCHITTERING, O
the O
custom B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
SUPER, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
VERY O
WARM O
and O
cozy O
and O
the O
hostess, B-TARGET
incredibly O
CHARMANT, O
it O
was O
enjoying O
in O
the O
greatest O
sense O
of O
the O
word! O

A O
better O
choice O
couldn't O
have O
been O
made O
by O
the O
birthday O
boy. O

We O
chose O
the O
menu O
and O
the O
custom O
wines. O

Four O
courses, B-TARGET
enough O
large O
portions O
and O
a O
caress O
for O
the O
taste O
buds. O

The O
selected O
wine B-TARGET
was O
SU-PER! O

The O
friendly O
and O
smooth O
service B-TARGET
and O
also O
the O
explanation O
for O
the O
dishes O
made O
this O
evening O
unforgettable! O

We'll O
be O
back! O

very O
nice O
food, B-TARGET
perfect O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
casual O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
hostess B-TARGET
gives O
you O
a O
warm O
welcome: O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back!! O

Very O
good O
food. O

I O
told O
you O
in O
advance O
that O
I O
didn't O
eat O
fish. O

I O
got O
two O
nicely O
adapted O
dishes. O

However, O
a O
supplement O
was O
charged O
for O
this, O
which O
was O
not O
discussed. O

That O
was O
a O
downside... O

Atmosphere, B-TARGET
wine, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
top! O

We O
ate O
a O
3-course O
menu. O

Everything O
was O
nice O
and O
cared O
for. O

Nice O
presentation. B-TARGET

Cozy O
and O
beautiful O
interior. B-TARGET

The O
owner B-TARGET
provides O
a O
nice O
reception O
and O
is O
very O
thoughtful. O

We O
went O
for O
a O
day O
at O
the O
sea O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

A O
plus O
for O
the O
location, B-TARGET
because O
you O
are O
just O
outside O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
of O
the O
coast O
in O
the O
cozy O
center O
of O
De O
Haan. O

Parking O
is O
not O
a O
problem. O

We O
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
well O
received O
by O
the O
owner B-TARGET
who O
could O
immediately O
give O
tips O
around O
the O
best O
places O
on O
the O
terrace. O

The O
month B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
very O
nice. O

My O
appetizer B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
basi I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
tomato, I-TARGET
mozarella I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
basil I-TARGET
was O
surprising, O
fresh O
and O
contemporary. O

A O
real O
flavor O
bomb! O

The O
carpaccio B-TARGET
on O
the O
other O
side O
fresh O
and O
thin, O
but O
to O
the O
taste O
of O
my O
husband O
provided O
with O
slightly O
too O
much O
olive O
oil. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
that O
came O
with O
it O
was O
great! O

The O
main B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
were O
again O
very O
nice O
and O
tasteful. O

The O
cod B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
black I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
delicious! O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
kind O
of O
soup O
based O
on O
fruit O
and O
vegetables O
and O
less O
our O
thing. O

But O
overall, O
delicious O
tabled O
in O
a O
very O
friendly O
and O
warm O
setting! B-TARGET

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
beautiful O
decor B-TARGET
and O
loose O
friendly O
reception. B-TARGET

What O
we O
got O
on O
the O
board O
was O
of O
a O
very O
high O
level. O

Not O
what O
you O
expect O
in O
a O
small O
polder O
village. O

You O
can O
clearly O
see O
here O
that O
super-educated O
yet O
simple O
sympathic O
people B-TARGET
are O
at O
work. O

We'll O
definitely O
come O
back O
here O
because O
we're O
curious O
about O
other O
dishes O
they O
put O
on O
the O
table. O

Highly O
recommended! O

The O
chef B-TARGET
puts O
the O
flavors O
on O
your O
plate O
while O
Tine B-TARGET
serves O
you O
with O
the O
smile. O

A O
super O
experience, O
The O
choice O
between O
2 O
menus O
is O
so O
difficult O
because O
everything O
is O
delicious. O

Third O
time O
we've O
had O
dinner O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

Every O
time O
top O
from O
a O
to O
z. O

The O
operation B-TARGET
is O
very O
smooth O
and O
pleasant. O

Tinne B-TARGET
always O
knows O
how O
to O
surprise; O

All O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
delicious O
at O
very O
high O
level. O

Very O
nice O
creations O
of O
the O
chef B-TARGET
who O
works O
with O
fresh O
products. B-TARGET

Just O
the O
best O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Worth O
at O
least O
one O
star. O

Delicious O
food, B-TARGET
beautiful O
surroundings, B-TARGET
fine O
operation B-TARGET
one O
minus. O

There O
is O
always O
mentioned O
lunch B-TARGET
at O
€37 O
and O
they O
charged O
€42 O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
it O
was O
a O
Sunday O
(21 O
July). O

I O
didn't O
think O
that O
was O
fair. O

Outside O
again O
checked O
and O
there O
is O
indeed O
always O
€37. O

Where O
to O
start? O

I O
don't O
know, O
maybe O
staff? O

rude O
(maw O
don't O
know O
the O
etiquette O
that O
belongs O
for O
a O
brasserie/cafe/taverne. O

drinks B-TARGET
are O
served O
in O
still O
half O
to O
almost O
dirty O
glasses O
(lipstick O
and O
similar O
from O
previous O
guests) O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
to O
mention. O

tastes O
like O
it's O
just O
ready-made O
meals O
warmed O
up O
in O
a O
microwave. O

Sauces, B-TARGET
think O
its O
pots O
are O
still O
half O
open O
and O
over O
date. O

Then O
vb O
tastes O
my O
own O
made O
mayonnaise O
that O
is O
completely O
crazy O
even O
better O
to O
eat. O

Will O
not O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
whole O
thing B-TARGET
in O
general. O

As O
far O
as O
I'm O
concerned O
never O
again, O
rather O
go O
to O
the O
pigsty O
on O
a O
farm, O
there O
it O
is O
cleaner O
and O
much O
better O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
and O
service. O

We O
were O
here O
in O
an O
aggressive O
way O
deprived O
of O
80€ O
and O
our O
food. O

After O
3x O
gravy O
questions O
and O
getting O
dished O
horrible O
sauce B-TARGET
I O
went O
to O
the O
operator O
to O
get O
a O
story O
(still O
kept O
quiet O
from O
fritte, O
chicken). O

He O
kept O
getting O
unfriendly, O
and O
when O
I O
answered O
him O
that O
client O
was O
still O
king, O
he O
just O
got O
angrier. O

I O
told O
him O
that O
with O
such O
a O
service B-TARGET
I O
was O
not O
inclined O
to O
pay. O

I O
went O
back O
to O
wife O
and O
kids O
sat O
down. O

Yet O
Mr. O
Further O
Eating O
Fri O
our O
hungry O
children O
suddenly O
stood O
the O
waiter O
beside O
us. O

PAYMENT!! O

NOW!!!! O

We O
urged O
him O
to O
calm O
down, O
this O
did O
not O
succeed O
after O
several O
times. O

He O
took O
the O
food O
from O
under O
our O
noses, O
threw O
it O
with O
a O
terrace O
chair O
and O
became O
ferocious O
and O
ferocious. O

At O
that O
time O
he O
was O
joined O
by O
all O
staff O
members O
and O
the O
patron, B-TARGET
who O
had O
even O
released O
the O
baseball O
bat. O

So O
I O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
pay... O

I O
brought O
in O
the O
police O
afterwards, O
but O
they O
couldn't O
do O
anything O
outside O
of O
a O
listening O
ear. O

So O
on O
this O
one O
I O
hope O
people O
stay O
out O
of O
here O
and O
save O
from O
their O
bad O
food B-TARGET
and O
bad O
aggressive O
services.. B-TARGET

Astoria B-TARGET
palace I-TARGET
may O
destroy O
your O
business!!!! O

Fucking O
thieves!! O

Chicken B-TARGET
was O
dry, O
fish B-TARGET
was O
not O
good O
(sat O
really O
a O
dirty O
smell) O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
tasted O
like O
soapy O
soup, O
fries B-TARGET
were O
weak O
and O
very O
fat, O
potatoes B-TARGET
not O
cooked, O
glasses B-TARGET
not O
clean. O

After O
we O
complained O
about O
the O
above O
findings, O
people O
were O
indignantly O
waved O
away O
everything O
and O
simply O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
full O
price. O

Serving B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
with O
dirty O
clothes, O
inside O
it O
didn't O
really O
look O
"clean." O

In O
short, O
with O
a O
groovy O
bow O
around O
this O
establishment!! B-TARGET

Reserved O
and O
waiting O
10 O
minutes O
outside O
together O
with O
another O
couple O
who O
had O
to O
be O
there, O
3 O
hours O
waiting O
for O
a O
third O
appetizer, O
when O
we O
made O
the O
comment O
we O
were O
asked O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
pay O
off O
by O
the O
boss, O
difficult O
to O
get O
a O
smile O
on O
the O
boss' B-TARGET
face O
when O
we O
decided O
to O
pay O
off O
the O
chef B-TARGET
came O
by O
simply O
saying O
that O
we O
don't O
respect O
the O
kitchen, O
we're O
people O
who O
are O
going O
to O
eat O
regularly O
but O
I O
haven't O
seen O
this O
yet, O
regrettably O
but O
a O
customer O
doesn't O
want O
to O
be O
treated O
like O
this O
when O
he O
pays O
a O
very O
expensive O
bill, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
tasty O
but O
have O
to O
wait O
too O
long O
sorry O

Yesterday O
dinner O
at O
Boury, B-TARGET
sorry O
but O
don't O
understand O
that O
this O
deserves O
a O
star, O
the O
ministry B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
businesswoman I-TARGET
leaves O
everything O
to O
be O
desired, O
a O
smile O
can't O
come O
off O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
supposed O
to O
be O
warm O
were O
cold, O
a O
very O
expensive O
bill B-TARGET
and O
not O
well O
eaten O
a O
snak O
and O
a O
snook O
at O
the O
checkout O
sorry O
but O
if O
you O
pay O
this O
price, O
think O
that O
some O
people O
should O
reconsider O
their O
opinion O
this O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
but O
for O
me O
a O
bistro, O
staff B-TARGET
was O
kind O
and O
apologize O
for O
the O
behavior O
of O
their O
superiors, O
I O
really O
can't O
recommend O
this O

From O
the O
moment O
we O
entered, O
we O
felt O
welcome. O

The O
apero O
followed O
several O
snacks. O

The O
appetizer B-TARGET
and O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
were O
really O
pictures. O

the O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
mignardises B-TARGET
at O
the O
coffee O
provided O
the O
perfect O
closing. O

The O
unusual O
wines B-TARGET
were O
truly O
discoveries. O

In O
short: O
you O
have O
to O
visit O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Congratulations O
to O
the O
whole O
Boury B-TARGET
team! I-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
nice, O
original O
brasserie B-TARGET
where O
you O
are O
always O
welcome O
and O
get O
tasty O
fresh O
products; B-TARGET

A O
downside, O
however, O
is O
the O
price, O
with O
2 O
people O
you O
will O
soon O
be O
over O
120 O
euros. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
well O
when O
you're O
in O
Veurne, O
you O
should O
definitely O
jump O
in O
at O
Lowie's. O

Interior B-TARGET
is O
cozy, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
smooth O
and O
especially O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

Fair O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
if O
you O
like O
to O
eat O
steak B-TARGET
tartar I-TARGET
then O
it O
must O
taste O
there O
with O
the O
home-cut O
and O
fried O
fries O

I O
had O
a O
client O
to O
spoil O
in O
Veurne. O

I O
remember O
the O
last O
super O
night, O
so O
I O
didn't O
take O
any O
chances O
and O
went O
to O
visit O
this O
brasserie. O

Croquettes O
of O
sweater, O
and O
other O
fine O
house B-TARGET
specialties, I-TARGET
and O
suggestion, O
etc. O

And O
closing O
with O
some O
funny O
annecdotes, O
my O
client O
was O
in O
the O
clouds! O

This O
is O
for O
me O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
in O
Belgium, O
original O
dishes B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
custom O
dishes, O
also O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
sublime O

Eating O
here O
is O
an O
experience. O

Custom O
meals O
for O
things O
that O
one O
does O
not O
like O
were O
absolutely O
no O
problem. O

Super O
delicious O
food, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
sublime O
wine. B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
the O
top O
of O
the O
bill O
with O
the O
forest O
walk. O

A O
forest O
scene O
made O
out O
of O
chocolate O
on O
a O
plate O
of O
branches O
and O
moss O
with O
morning O
snow O
rising O
out O
of O
a O
jar. O

This O
is O
real O
enjoyment! O

Why O
aren't O
there O
two O
stars O
yet? O

Parking B-TARGET
and O
surroundings B-TARGET
not O
inviting O
but O
what O
a O
surprise O
inside B-TARGET

-Customized O
and O
yet O
family O
service, B-TARGET
growing O
variations B-TARGET
in O
plates O
and O
always O
those O
little O

bombs O
that O
provide O
culinary O
pleasure O

-congratulations O
to O
the O
chef B-TARGET
for O
his O
courage O
to O
conjure O
up O
new O
flavors O

Perfect O
balance O
between O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
unique O
meal. B-TARGET

The O
chef O
asked O
if O
he O
could O
enjoy O
himself O
on O
a O
culinary O
level. O

He O
did O
this O
in O
a O
wonderful O
way. O

Each O
dish B-TARGET
was O
a O
caress O
for O
the O
tongue O
and O
the O
eye. O

The O
matching O
wines B-TARGET
made O
the O
unique O
experience O
complete. O

You O
feel O
that O
the O
chef B-TARGET
and O
his O
maître O
do O
this O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
passion. O

Grateful O
we O
look O
back O
on O
a O
good O
night. O

Chief O
Marc, O
Maître O
Bert, O

enjoyed O

restaurant, B-TARGET
both O
downstairs O
and O
upstairs O
(3 O
rooms O
differently O
furnished O
and O
all O
three O
cozy). O

We O
chose O
the O
menu B-TARGET
'Pearls I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
India', I-TARGET
a O
must O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
meet O
different O
dishes O
from O
India. O

You O
will O
always O
get O
a O
little O
explanation O
with O
each O
dish O
and O
which O
sauces O
are O
best O
suited O
to O
which O
dish. O

We O
could O
taste O
lamb, B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
scampis I-TARGET
prepared O
in O
different O
ways. O

Very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
tasty O
wines B-TARGET
(we O
chose O
the O
adapted O
wines). O

Everything O
is O
freshly O
prepared, O
you O
think O
you're O
in O
India O
for O
a O
while! O

Definitely O
recommended O
and O
likely O
to O
be O
repeated. O

Definitely O
recommended O

If O
you've O
never O
tried O
the O
exotic O

before! O

And O
for O
the O
people O
who O
prefer O
to O

very O

people O
who O
are O
very O
hungry O
there O
is O
no O

not O
too O
spicy O
and O

recommended: O
a O
touch O
for O
all O
senses. O

The O
operation B-TARGET
is O
smooth O
and O
always O
with O
a O
word O
explanation. O

And O
when O
Vicky, B-TARGET
the O
hostess O
has O
even O
a O
moment's O
time O
she O
comes O
up O
with O
the O
charm O
of O
Indian O
hospitality O
herself O
to O
see O
if O
everything O
is O
okay O
and O
if O
you O
enjoyed O
it! O

Pretty O
new O
restaurant, O
exists O
since O
2013. O

Between O
the O
station O
and O
the O
center O
of O
Ronse. O

Very O
friendly O
reception. B-TARGET

Refined O
food. B-TARGET

The O
Indira B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Not O
large O
quantities, O
but O
refined O
with O
multiple O
extras. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
garden O
terrace O
and O
a O
street O
terrace. O

Closed O
on O
Tuesday. O

perfect O
to O
stop O
on O
a O
bike O
ride O
here O
located O
on O
the O
water, O
nice O
view O
and O
quiet O
good O
food, B-TARGET
nothing O
special O
but O
was O
not O
necessary O

Formidable! O

The O
only O
word O
that O
fits O
the O
wedding O
party O
of O
daughter O
Nathalie O
with O
son-in-law O
Stijn O
on O
2 O
August O
2014 O
in O
this O
unique O
location. B-TARGET

From O
the O
boat O
trip, O
offered O
to O
the O
couple, O
through O
the O
cozy O
and O
extremely O
spontaneous O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
to O
the O
super O
tasty O
meals B-TARGET
and O
the O
happy O
faces O
of O
family O
and O
friends O
to O
the O
fantastic O
wedding O
cake! O

And O
this O
in O
a O
shining O
sun: O
A O
day O
to O
never O
forget... O
and O
a O
must O
for O
all! O

We O
have O
already O
started O
eating O
a O
few O
times O
in O
2 O
years O
and O
always O
find O
the O
food B-TARGET
delicious O
but O
nothing O
special. O

What O
we O
also O
noticed O
is O
that O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at O
this O
time O
actually O
doesn't O
change O
what O
I O
personally O
regret. O

The O
operation B-TARGET
is O
quite O
okay O
depending O
on O
who/when/... O
one O
is O
already O
a O
bit O
more O
friendly O
than O
the O
other. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
really O
nice O
when O
you O
are O
outside O
and O
inside O
it O
is O
cozy. O

Several O
times O
already O
dinner O
at O
Gwen O
and O
Philippe O
in O
the O
Keyserhof, B-TARGET
and O
always O
went O
out O
again O
with O
a O
smile. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
food B-TARGET
delicious, O
but O
also O
their O
staff B-TARGET
deserves O
a O
big O
plume! O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
on O
the O
Moervaart, O
which O
only O
makes O
your O
visit O
more O
pleasant/romantic. O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
Keyserhof!! B-TARGET

bad O
and O
unfriendly O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
was O
downright O
bad. O

2 O
hours O
waiting O
for O
your O
dinner O
with O
a O
water O
sangria, B-TARGET
then O
get O
half O
hot O
food. B-TARGET

The O
reckoning B-TARGET
was O
4.5 O
euros O
wrong O
to O
our O
disadvantage! O

Worst O
restaurant B-TARGET
(cafe) O
we've O
ever O
been O
to. O

Stay O
away O
from O
there. O

Many O
heard O
of O
this O
but O
what O
a O
setback, O
the O
so-called O
all O
self-made O
was O
quite O
disappointing, O
rather O
a O
better O
bite O
tent O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
downright O
terrible, O
long O
wait, O
wrong O
things O
on O
the O
table, O
clearly O
unable O
to O
handle O
the O
pressure O
and O
operation O
and O
show O
this O
very O
clearly O
to O
the O
customers O
too, O
great O
disappointment O

Back O
to O
our O
favorite O
tapas B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
in O
Herentals. O

To O
our O
surprise O
new O
operators O
and O
not O
as O
cozy O
dark O
as O
before O
in O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
bar. I-TARGET

The O
new O
operators O
come O
straight O
from O
Spain O
so O
we O
were O
expecting O
extra O
tasty O
tapas O
but O
unfortunately O
the O
gamba's B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
look I-TARGET
were O
served O
lukewarm O
and O
not O
very O
spicy O
as O
it O
should O
be O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
also O
lukewarm. O

What O
a O
pity O
but O
I O
said O
some O
of O
it O
and O
ordered O
2 O
new O
portions B-TARGET
but O
then O
hot O
and O
that O
was O
nice. O

But O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
no O
longer O
there, O
apparently O
left O
with O
the O
previous O
operators. O

Too O
bad O
next O
time O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
big O
market O
in O
Herentals O
there O
is O
also O
a O
nice O
tapas O
bar. O

Try O
them O
out. O

cozy O
and O
simple. O

Sometimes O
you O
get O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
current B-TARGET
operators, I-TARGET
unlike O
the O
previous O
operators, O
do O
not O
work O
with O
full O
"desire." O

Everyone's O
friendly, O
but O
a O
smile O
is O
hard. O

Shit, O
they're O
doing O
their O
best. O

Delicious O
food O
in O
the O
romantic O
garden B-TARGET
by O
the O
water O
with O
the O
fish. O

Gamba's B-TARGET
Indian I-TARGET
way I-TARGET
is O
super O
tasty.. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
always O
friendly O
and O
fast. O

The O
food B-TARGET
takes O
a O
bit O
long O
but O
worth O
the O
wait O
because O
it O
is O
delicious O
and O
tasty O
fresh. O

Lunch O
is O
faster O
than O
dinner. O

In O
short, O
the B-TARGET
wild I-TARGET
vespers I-TARGET
is O
our O
favorite O
here O
in O
Herentals. O

See O
you O
soon! O

good O
food, B-TARGET
salads, O

something O
for O
everyone. O

and O
very O
tasty O
desertions. B-TARGET

Inside B-TARGET
it O
is O
nice, O
but O
outside B-TARGET
in O
the O
summer O
it O
is O
really O
great. O

The O
Wild O
Vespers O
has O
a O
tasteful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
a O
beautiful O
garden B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pond. I-TARGET

Many O
people, O
when O
the O
weather O
is O
nice, O
can O
enjoy O
it O
during O
dinner. O

or O
just O
classic O
- O
for O
a O
good O
fast O
lunch B-TARGET
you O
can O
always O
come O
here. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
up I-TARGET
of O
the O
tables O
seems O
a O
little O
weird, O
uncomfortable. O

Not O
suitable O
for O
a O
cozy O
meal. O

Sunday O
night... O
and O
apparently O
the O
staff B-TARGET
think O
it's O
normal O
that O
there's O
hardly O
anything O
left O
in O
stock. O

The O
tortillas B-TARGET
that O
are O
usually O
served O
as O
snacks O
in O
advance O
-on. O

No O
excuses, O
just O
- O
'they're O
out'. O

Beer, B-TARGET
different O
dishes B-TARGET
-op. O

When O
I O
finally O
respond O
that O
this O
is O
strange, O
I O
just O
get O
the O
answer: O
it's O
Sunday O
night, O
that's O
normal O
after O
a O
busy O
weekend. O

With O
chi O
chis O
I O
don't O
expect O
culinary O
delights, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
may O
at O
least O
be O
correct O
and O
polite. O

Dinner O
at O
the O
Backhuys O
in O
tessenderlo O
a O
while O
ago. O

At O
25° O
cozy O
food O
on O
a O
beautiful O
terrace, B-TARGET
what O
could O
be O
more O
fun. O

I O
ordered O
a O
steppe O
grass O
with O
steak O
and O
the O
steppe O
sauce. O

We've O
had O
to O
wait O
over O
an O
hour O
for O
our O
food. O

The O
steppe B-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

But O
the O
steak B-TARGET
was O
completely O
baked O
and O
like O
a O
shoe O
sole. O

My O
friend's O
chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
was O
well-baked O
and O
juicy. O

Too O
bad O
about O
the O
meat B-TARGET
and O
the O
long O
wait, O
but O
deserves O
a O
second O
chance O
because O
of O
the O
cozy O
location B-TARGET

A O
nice O
reception, B-TARGET
a O
nice O
location, B-TARGET
The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
well O
cared O
for O
and O
a O
decent O
serving! O

Highly O
recommended O
for O
a O
pleasant O
evening! O

We O
were O
still O
chatting O
with O
a O
drink O
this O
wasn't O
a O
problem, O
we O
weren't O
kicked O
out! O

If O

you O
can O
stay O
in O

or O
go O
all O

people O
who O
want O
something O
other O
than O
mussels O
fries. O

Be O
surprised! O

A O
little O
shocked O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
only O
one O
menu B-TARGET
was O
proposed, O
but O
oh O
so O
delicious O
eaten O
and O
drunk. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
else, O
this O
is O
negotiable. O

2 O
People B-TARGET
who O
know O
their O
profession O
very O
well, O
are O
very O
hospitable O
and O
if O
the O
service O
allows O
it O
please O
make O
a O
chat O
with O
their O
guests. O

We O
are O
happy O
to O
have O
discovered O
this O
nice O
address B-TARGET
and O
are O
sure O
to O
go O
back! O

They O
just O
forgot O
about O
us. O

Pork B-TARGET
tenderloin I-TARGET
almost O
raw O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
stew I-TARGET
you O
had O
to O
look O
for. O

Very O
unfriendly O
as O
if O
they O
don't O
like O
you O
coming O
to O
dinner. O

Worthless. O

Dinner O
at O
Den O
Cleynen O
Keyser O
this O
afternoon. O

Staff B-TARGET
unfriendly, O
even O
asked O
twice O
for O
card. O

Order O
came O
after O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half! O

1x O
fetuccine B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
curry, I-TARGET
really O
bad O
we O
have O
left, O
2x O
grilled B-TARGET
scampi I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
herbal I-TARGET
butter, I-TARGET
this O
was O
served O
in O
a O
cowardly O
tasteless O
lookroom B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
not O
in O
herbal O
butter, O
ready-to-use O
liflaf. B-TARGET

In O
addition O
a O
steak O
with O
pepper O
cream O
sauce, O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
reasonable O
steak B-TARGET
again O
faint. O

Wine B-TARGET
from O
tap, O
also O
dirty, O
no O
other O
wine B-TARGET
to O
order! O

The O
waitress, B-TARGET
I O
think O
daughter, O
asked O
three O
times O
for O
the O
free O
access O
code O
of O
the O
Wi-Fi O
network, O
she O
couldn't O
remember O
(!) O
so O
didn't O
I O
get O
it? O

Then O
you O
shouldn't O
offer O
it! O

Then O
at O
the O
checkout O
(Euro O
100,--) O
was O
not O
asked O
by O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
if O
it O
had O
tasted O
us, O
that O
was O
clear O
because O
the O
signs O
were O
not O
empty. O

Next O
came O
the O
owner B-TARGET
who O
asked O
if O
it O
had O
tasted, O
I O
clearly O
indicated O
that O
it O
was O
not O
good. O

Sir B-TARGET
ran O
away O
and O
then O
stopped O
looking O
at O
me, O
and O
nothing O
else O
to O
do O
with O
my O
answer. O

My O
advice, O
go O
somewhere O
else O
to O
eat. O

Worthless... O
