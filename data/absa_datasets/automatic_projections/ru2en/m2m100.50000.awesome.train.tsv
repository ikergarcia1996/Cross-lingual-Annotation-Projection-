Good O
hour O
of O
the O
day. O

My O
name O
is O
Government! O

My O
young O
man O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
his O
friends O
celebrated O
their O
birthday O
literally O
on O
the O
other O
day O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
met O
us O
and O
took O
us O
to O
the O
table O
which O
served O
us O
very O
well. O

It O
was O
in O
a O
cozy O
corner B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
main O
hall, O
the O
dim B-TARGET
light I-TARGET
is O
the O
main O
part O
of O
this O
restaurant O
there O
is O
no O
daylight O
it O
was O
a O
big O
plus O
for O
our O
birthday! O

We O
just O
arrived O
at O
four O
o’clock O
in O
the O
day, O
so O
the O
evening O
was O
pleasantly O
long. O

At O
our O
not O
big O
banquet O
we O
ordered O
a O
couple O
of O
pleasant O
dishes, B-TARGET
I O
ordered O
the O
snacks B-TARGET
very O
delicious O
was O
and O
quite O
inexpensive O
about O
300 O
rubles O
washed, O
my O
young O
man O
ordered O
meat B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
mangal, I-TARGET
which O
they O
have O
full, O
he O
will O
not O
please O
usually, O
and O
then O
liked O
his O
friends O
also O
ordered O
portions O
of O
different O
meat B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
mangal I-TARGET
also O
very O
liked! O

Closer O
to O
the O
evening O
we O
were O
warned O
that O
there O
would O
be O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
we O
were O
so O
pleased O
with O
this O
unexpected O
surprise O
we O
just O
had O
the O
time O
for O
dancing, O
and O
then O
accompanied O
by O
such O
a O
beautiful O
voice B-TARGET
of O
the O
soloist......!!! O

Overall, O
we O
stayed O
crazy O
pleased O
with O
the O
evening O
in O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
so O
we O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone.) O

I O
was O
in O
the O
diet O
last O
week O
with O
a O
friend. O

They O
came O
by O
chance, O
both O
of O
them O
have O
not O
been O
to O
Chinese O
restaurants, O
decided O
to O
try O
what O
it O
is. O

They O
didn’t O
know O
what O
to O
order, O
relying O
on O
the O
waitress’s O
taste. O

Absolutely O
not O
disappointed! O

My O
friend O
brought O
me O
a O
pork, O
and O
I O
brought O
me O
a O
pork O
in O
Beijing. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
unusual. O

It O
would O
be O
interesting O
to O
come O
in O
and O
try O
something O
else. O

Regarding O
the O
interior B-TARGET
: O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
quiet, O
no O
noisy O
companies O
(there O
was O
no, O
at O
least O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
visit), O
very O
pleasant O
and O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
all O
in O
the O
best O
traditions. O

Very O
pleased O
with O
this O
facility. B-TARGET

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
several O
times, O
I O
can O
only O
say O
the O
best O
about O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Amazing O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
very O
delicious O
soups, B-TARGET
excellent O
desserts. B-TARGET

Last O
time O
I O
was O
with O
friends, O
everyone O
was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
several O
rooms B-TARGET
for O
different O
tastes O
and O
company. O

Generally O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
for O
lunch O
and O
dinner O
with O
friends. O

Yesterday O
we O
celebrated O
our O
birthday O
at O
a O
restaurant, O
going O
there O
for O
two O
days O
to O
explore. O

We O
both O
liked O
everything O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
invite O
guests O
there, O
one O
of O
whom O
was O
a O
great O
expert O
and O
critic O
in O
terms O
of O
food. O

Immediately O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
she O
did O
not O
have O
to O
criticize, O
because O
she O
remained, O
like O
all O
the O
other O
guests, O
very O
pleased! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
in O
light O
French O
style O
with O
pleasant O
lighting B-TARGET
on O
the O
tables, O
service B-TARGET
without O
imposing O
unnecessary O
dishes O
and O
drinks O
(servant O
Anna), O
everything O
happened O
clearly O
and O
quickly. O

Well, O
about O
the O
quality B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
performance I-TARGET
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
there O
is O
nothing O
to O
say! O

They O
took O
all O
the O
different O
salads B-TARGET
and O
hot, B-TARGET
and O
everyone O
was O
very O
pleased O
(fish, B-TARGET
meat, B-TARGET
and O
poultry). B-TARGET

Everything O
is O
beautifully O
decorated O
and O
prepared O
right O
before O
serving O
on O
the O
table. O

I O
think O
that O
this O
previously O
unknown O
to O
us O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
city O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Veritas", I-TARGET
will O
become O
our O
family O
meeting O
place! O

Now O
when O
asked O
by O
friends O
"to O
which O
restaurant O
to O
go O
with O
guests O
from O
Moscow O
or O
celebrate O
a O
birthday?" O
we O
will O
advise O
"Veritas". B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
for O
the O
warm O
and O
warm O
reception. B-TARGET

Further O
success O
to O
you! O

Visited O
this O
restaurant O
25,08,12. O

After O
the O
visit, O
there O
is O
no O
desire O
to O
come O
again. O

There O
are O
many O
shortcomings O
in O
both O
the O
work O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

I O
ordered O
pizza O
from O
the O
children’s O
menu. O

To O
the O
greatest O
surprise, O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
(again O
- O
from O
the O
children's O
menu!) O
was O
so O
spicy O
that O
adults O
could O
not O
eat O
it, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
child. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
generally O
commented O
on O
this O
so O
that O
the O
children’s O
menu O
is O
for O
adults O
who O
want O
to O
order O
small O
portions, O
not O
for O
children. O
:)) O

Asked O
to O
bring O
ordinary O
apple O
juice, O
not O
fresh, O
brought O
fresh, O
had O
to O
return. O

Asked O
to O
bring O
"fresh O
juice O
in O
a O
large O
glass O
+ O
carbonated O
water" O
juice O
brought O
in O
a O
small O
glass O
about O
water O
forgotten. O

I O
asked O
the O
waitress O
to O
help O
me O
choose O
from O
two O
dishes. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
said O
"we O
have O
everything O
delicious" O
and O
could O
not O
help O
with O
the O
choice. O

For O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
rating O
3, O
because O
of O
the O
whole O
order O
only O
liked O
pancotta. B-TARGET

Caesar’s B-TARGET
salad O
was O
a O
very O
spicy O
pizza B-TARGET
from O
the O
children’s O
menu. O

For O
service B-TARGET
3, O
because O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
confused O
orders, O
could O
not O
help O
with O
the O
choice O
(or O
did O
not O
want O
when O
the O
customer O
asks O
to O
help O
determine, O
he O
does O
not O
want O
to O
hear O
"all O
delicious, O
take O
all"). O

And O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
children’s O
menu O
is O
not O
for O
children, O
in O
general, O
“killed.” O

Among O
the O
pluses O
I O
want O
to O
note O
the O
babysitter B-TARGET
in O
the O
child's O
room, O
a O
very O
cute O
girl, B-TARGET
the O
child O
very O
liked. O

I O
didn't O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
as O
a O
child, O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
everything O
was O
once, O
but O
now O
it's O
quite O
nice O
and O
cozy O
institution B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
kitchen. B-TARGET

The O
first O
time O
we O
visited O
Cheburek O
a O
month O
ago O
- O
we O
celebrated O
the O
previous O
wedding O
with O
friends. O

The O
administration B-TARGET
gently O
provided O
us O
with O
a O
new O
banquet O
hall, O
where O
we O
closed, O
turned O
on O
our O
music, O
smoked O
calyan, O
had O
fun, O
and O
no O
one O
bothered O
us. O

Everyone O
liked O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
great O
too. O

I O
was O
most O
pleased O
that O
the O
administration B-TARGET
went O
to O
meet O
us O
and O
made O
a O
good O
discount O
on O
the O
banquet O
:) O

A O
week O
later, O
my O
girlfriend O
returned O
to O
Cheburek B-TARGET
with O
her O
relatives, O
where O
they O
celebrated O
her O
father’s O
anniversary. O

We O
also O
come O
back O
here O
again O
and O
again. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
annoys O
me O
is O
the O
rise O
in O
prices. O

Over O
the O
past O
month, O
prices O
have O
changed O
twice. O

They O
grow O
a O
little O
bit, O
but O
still O
the O
cost O
of O
dinner B-TARGET
and O
for O
two O
with O
each O
visit O
we O
got O
higher O
and O
higher O
:) O

Without O
it, O
of O
course, O
there O
is O
nowhere. O

From O
the O
kitchen, O
I O
can O
recommend: O
Chebureques B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
Sulluguni I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
greens I-TARGET
(magic!), O
Satsivi B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
strawberries, I-TARGET
Chanachi B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
of O
course, O
hinkali, B-TARGET
well, O
and O
probably O
lamb B-TARGET
legs I-TARGET
(I O
do O
not O
remember O
the O
exact O
name O
of O
the O
dish). O

All O
this O
will O
not O
leave O
anyone O
indifferent, O
very O
delicious O
and O
"authentic"!)) O

I O
visited O
this O
place O
five O
times. O

There O
was O
only O
a O
good O
kitchen B-TARGET
to O
come O
back. O

Carpaccio O
is O
served O
with O
all O
sorts O
of O
balsams O
and O
oil. O

Good O
choice O
of O
wine. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pleasant: O
there O
is O
a O
closet, B-TARGET
sofas, B-TARGET
dim O
light, O
non-obsessive O
music B-TARGET
(even O
once O
stumbled O
there O
on O
a O
saxophonist), O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere... B-TARGET

But! O

Service B-TARGET
is O
disgusting! O

It O
will O
forever O
remain O
in O
the O
memory O
of O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
who O
referred O
to O
us O
exclusively O
on O
"you", O
held, O
and O
when O
he O
was O
made O
a O
comment, O
he O
told O
us O
that O
he O
had O
a O
quarrel O
with O
his O
girlfriend O
and O
he O
had O
a O
disgusting O
mood! O

The O
other O
time O
we O
were O
no O
less O
lucky. O

My O
husband O
ordered O
a O
steak O
and O
we O
often O
waited O
for O
him O
to O
arrive O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour! O

When O
our O
waiter B-TARGET
still O
instructed O
to O
appear O
(we O
sat O
almost O
at O
the O
entrance), O
we O
refused O
the O
steak, O
but O
he O
magically O
still O
found O
himself O
on O
the O
table O
in O
5 O
minutes O
and O
had O
to O
explain O
to O
the O
waiter O
for O
a O
long O
time O
that O
no O
one O
would O
eat O
him! O

The O
summary O
is O
as O
follows: O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
generally O
excellent, O
prices O
are O
not O
bitten, O
but O
you O
should O
seriously O
think O
about O
replacing O
staff... B-TARGET

On O
Saturday O
evening, O
we O
went O
to O
the O
company O
at O
the O
Dolce O
Italy O
café O
and O
drank O
coffee O
with O
cakes. O

It O
was O
nine O
o’clock, O
and O
the O
café, O
as O
it O
turned O
out, O
closed O
exactly O
at O
nine O
o’clock. O

We O
were O
kindly O
offered O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
and O
the O
cakes O
promised O
to O
bring O
there. O

This O
is O
how O
we O
met O
the O
Italian O
restaurant. O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
a O
full O
hall. O

For O
us, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
find O
only O
a O
table O
for O
smokers, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
bother O
much, O
as O
ventilation B-TARGET
does. O

What O
we O
ordered O
we O
liked. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quiet, O
made O
with O
taste, O
but O
without O
special O
excuses. O

I O
think O
it’s O
more O
suitable O
for O
a O
company O
than O
to O
come O
together. O

As O
for O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
forgot O
about O
us O
at O
first, O
had O
to O
shrink O
to O
make O
an O
order. O

But O
everything O
else O
is O
polite O
and O
warning. O

Caesar O
needed O
a O
sauce O
without O
anchois O
for O
the O
salad. O

At O
first, O
the O
chef B-TARGET
said O
that O
they O
could O
only O
offer O
mayonnaise, B-TARGET
that O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
prepared O
in O
the O
morning O
was O
the O
same O
for O
everyone. O

A O
minute O
later O
he O
ran O
back O
and O
promised O
to O
do O
everything O
in O
the O
best O
way. O

Let’s O
go O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
again. O

Try O
more O
Italian O
dishes. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
an O
Italian O
restaurant. O

Will O
it O
be O
Italy? O
:) O

I O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago. O

The O
table O
was O
not O
ordered. O

You O
can’t O
say O
anything O
negative O
about O
the O
service B-TARGET
– O
they O
approach O
quickly, O
everyone O
gets O
scared, O
they O
approach O
and O
ask O
if O
they O
like O
everything. O

is O
pleasant. O

Interior B-TARGET
for O
the O
lover, O
but O
cute O
and O
comfortable. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
good. O

It O
is O
delicious, O
not O
so O
expensive. O

The O
drawing B-TARGET
is O
original, O
but... O

I O
personally O
did O
not O
like O
it, O
although O
the O
idea O
is O
not O
bad. O

The O
girls O
obviously O
like. O

I O
personally O
expected O
a O
bit O
more O
fearful O
meat B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
in O
such O
a O
mangal O
restaurant. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
there O
is O
one O
shale B-TARGET
from O
each O
type O
of O
meat, O
in O
principle O
enough, O
but O
I O
want O
to O
see O
something O
unusual. O

The O
first O
visit O
to O
Dacia O
was O
as O
part O
of O
the O
search O
for O
a O
restaurant O
for O
a O
wedding O
banquet. O

Right O
from O
the O
threshold O
a O
pleasant O
attitude. B-TARGET

A O
very O
nice O
and O
polite O
man B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
closet. O

Smile O
and O
mood O
improves. O

Called O
us O
the O
administrator, B-TARGET
the O
most O
pleasant O
girl, B-TARGET
told O
everything, O
showed, O
no O
questions O
arose, O
even O
looked O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
eye O
in O
the O
small O
hall O
(at O
this O
time O
there O
was O
a O
banquet). O

I O
left O
the O
coordinates, O
the O
same O
evening O
the O
menu O
was O
received O
to O
the O
mail. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
all O
greet O
and O
smile, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
stunning. O

We O
decided O
to O
go O
back O
for O
lunch. O

Another O
pleasant O
meeting B-TARGET
in O
the O
closet. O

A O
pleasant O
compliment O
in O
the O
cold O
weather, O
while O
waiting O
for O
the O
order O
drank O
a O
hot O
tea, B-TARGET
amazing! O

The O
girl B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
(in O
the O
cheque O
was O
written O
Louise) O
polite, O
service B-TARGET
unobtrusive, O
quality. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
good! O

The O
meat B-TARGET
from O
his O
cottage O
is O
amazing, O
delicious! O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
large. O

They O
remained O
very O
satisfied! O

Doubts O
about O
choosing O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
the O
wedding O
did O
not O
arise, O
I O
hope O
that O
on O
the O
most O
important O
day O
of O
our O
lives O
we O
will O
also O
remain O
happy, O
this O
week O
we O
are O
going O
to O
order O
:). O

I O
recommend O
everyone O
to O
visit O
this O
wonderful O
place! B-TARGET

Today O
I O
was O
with O
a O
young O
man O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

I O
can O
say O
one O
thing O
- O
we O
found O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
everyone O
really O
should O
go O
and O
enjoy O
spending O
time O
in O
a O
quiet, O
cozy O
environment. B-TARGET

True, O
very O
cute, O
romantic O
candles B-TARGET
in O
the O
water O
on O
each O
table, O
comfortable O
chairs, B-TARGET
dim B-TARGET
light, I-TARGET
music, B-TARGET
smell B-TARGET
even. O

Japanese B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
- O
on O
5+..from O
the O
packed B-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
get O
rid O
of) O

European B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
not O
behind..)all O
in O
the O
highest O
range. O
for O
fairly O
low O
prices O
very O
delicious.and O
service..pleasant B-TARGET
girls, B-TARGET
very O
quickly O
brought O
the O
order, O
all O
great. O

Cocktails B-TARGET
and O
alcohol B-TARGET
can O
be O
seen O
as O
not O
diluted O
and O
also O
on O
5+. O
in O
general, O
the O
conclusion O
is O
one O
- O
we O
will O
come O
there O
again O
and O
again! O

We O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
for O
the O
first O
time O
on O
the O
Day O
of O
all O
lovers, O
we O
really O
liked O
the O
video O
of O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
we O
decided O
to O
go. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
at O
a O
high O
level, O
at O
the O
entrance, O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
met O
us O
and O
offered O
to O
choose O
the O
table O
we O
liked O
and O
warned O
us O
that O
the O
hotter O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
longer O
because O
there O
was O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
but O
we O
were O
not O
upset O
because O
we O
were O
warned O
in O
advance, O
and O
this O
is O
not O
very O
important. O

The B-TARGET
quality I-TARGET
of O
the O
kitchen O
was O
without O
remarks, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
quite O
attentive O
in O
our O
view, O
but O
it O
was O
little O
visible O
that O
some O
vanity O
was O
present. O

Overall, O
we O
were O
impressed O
by O
the O
evening. O

thanks O

Yesterday, O
it O
was O
on O
Monday, O
February O
14, O
I O
went O
to O
this O
place, O
previously O
unknown O
to O
me. O

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
comfortable. O

There O
are, O
of O
course, O
as O
in O
any O
other O
cafe O
tables, O
which O
you O
will O
not O
call O
cozy, O
but O
you O
will O
not O
please O
everyone O
and O
overall O
I O
liked O
the O
situation. B-TARGET

Immediately O
you O
can O
see O
that O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
approached O
as O
carefully O
as O
possible, O
which O
is O
pleasant. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
and O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
very O
polite. O

The O
cafe O
feels O
from O
the O
staff B-TARGET
that O
people O
want O
to O
work O
and O
they O
like O
it, O
and O
that’s O
the O
most O
important O
thing!) O

There O
was O
no O
delay O
in O
serving O
meals O
or O
drinks. O

The O
only O
surprise O
was O
when O
I O
was O
brought O
a O
spoonful O
for O
dessert O
instead O
of O
a O
dessert O
fork, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
cause O
any O
problems. O

Try O
this O
dessert. B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
we O
liked O
it. O

Sushi B-TARGET
paned I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
or O
somehow O
caused O
a O
lot O
of O
admiration, O
because O
it O
was O
really O
delicious. O

On O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
you O
can O
say O
that O
it O
is O
a O
cafe B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
love O
the O
ratio O
of O
price O
and O
quality. O

There O
is O
everything O
necessary. O

Overall, O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
leaves O
very O
pleasant O
memories. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
everyone O
to O
go O
and O
try O
the O
local O
Japanese B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

On O
the O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
on O
the O
sofas B-TARGET
is O
very O
convenient O
to O
accommodate O
company. O

I O
recently O
celebrated O
my O
birthday O
in O
San O
Francisco. O

It O
was O
crazy O
liked. O

Guests O
are O
delighted. O

Beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
good O
service, B-TARGET
fast, O
non-obsessive. O

I O
liked O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

There O
are O
also O
oriental O
dishes, B-TARGET
and O
European, O
and O
Japanese. O

Since O
in O
our O
company O
everyone O
had O
different O
tastes O
it O
was O
very O
pleased, O
everyone O
found O
a O
suitable O
dish B-TARGET
for O
themselves. O

Large O
portions, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
delicious. O

I O
liked O
Calvin B-TARGET
very O
much. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
great O
selection O
of O
cocktails, B-TARGET
some O
of O
which O
are O
not O
bad. O

I O
especially O
liked O
the O
orgasm B-TARGET
and O
the O
strawberry B-TARGET
margarita. I-TARGET

Overall, O
everyone O
is O
pleased, O
I O
recommend O
it! O

They O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
a O
Chinese O
restaurant O
near O
the O
house, O
the O
closest O
was O
Jean-Jean. O

At O
first O
glance, O
Chinese O
attributes O
were O
visible O
from O
the O
street. O

Inside O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
of O
the O
dance O
floor, O
a O
European O
pop O
was O
walking, O
we O
were O
asked O
to O
go O
to O
the O
second O
floor. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
"Chinese B-TARGET
interior" I-TARGET
- O
sofas B-TARGET
like O
in O
bistro, O
tables B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
table O
by O
the O
type O
of O
a-la O
dining O
room, O
European O
lights O
/ O
lights, O
in O
general O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
Chinese O
absolutely O
no! O

The O
facility B-TARGET
is O
uncomfortable. O

Well, O
since O
going O
elsewhere O
was O
no O
longer O
the O
strength, O
decided O
to O
order O
all O
such O
food. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
was O
not O
pleased O
- O
printed O
sheets, O
the O
composition B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
weight O
were O
not O
understood, O
there O
was O
no O
talk O
about O
the O
pictures. O

Well O
okay O
- O
with O
Chinese O
cuisine O
familiar O
- O
ordered O
beef, B-TARGET
pork, B-TARGET
rice, B-TARGET
a O
couple O
of O
snacks, B-TARGET
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
large, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
brought O
everything O
hot. O

Of O
course, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
serving B-TARGET
of O
the O
table O
could O
be O
better. O

Regarding O
the O
service O
- O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
did O
not O
say O
hello, O
did O
not O
have O
time O
to O
sit O
down O
- O
came O
for O
the O
order, O
indeed O
the O
dishes O
were O
delivered O
quickly, O
but O
the O
bill O
had O
to O
wait... O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
besides O
us, O
only O
2 O
tables O
were O
still O
occupied. O

In O
general, O
it O
was O
delicious O
to O
eat, O
but O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
go O
a O
second O
time O
- O
I O
still O
like O
to O
have O
a O
Chinese O
entourage O
in O
such O
places. O

Recently O
from O
friends O
learned O
about O
the O
restaurant O
"Mamaliga". O

On O
Sunday O
evening, O
I O
decided O
to O
visit. O

We O
enter O
a O
restaurant, O
where O
we O
are O
met O
by O
a O
kind, O
beautiful O
girl. B-TARGET

It O
leads O
to O
the O
table, O
indicates O
where O
you O
can O
leave O
the O
top O
clothes O
( O

There O
is O
no O
wardrobe O
in O
the O
establishment, O
but O
there O
are O
floor O
hangers).A O
few O
minutes O
later O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
came O
to O
us O
from O
the O
menu. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
interior! B-TARGET

Very O
unusual O
and O
interesting O
design B-TARGET
decision. I-TARGET

All O
the O
details O
are O
thought O
out O
to O
the O
smallest O
and O
together O
create O
a O
wonderful O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
warmth O
and O
comfort. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
looks O
good O
and O
easy O
to O
read, O
and O
there O
is O
also O
a O
special O
offer. O

Prices O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
in O
order. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
know O
the O
menu, O
work O
coherently, O
are O
attentive O
to O
the O
guests. O

Smile, O
which O
is O
always O
nice. O
in O
a O
word, O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
10 O
points O
is O
not O
worthwhile O
despite O
the O
large O
number O
of O
guests. O

They O
prepare O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
but O
not O
critically O
(maybe O
because O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
guests O
in O
the O
institution) O

They O
cook O
very O
delicious, O
especially O
shishlies B-TARGET
and O
Napoleon. B-TARGET
(thanks O
to O
the O
great O
chefs) O

A O
beautiful O
Caucasian B-TARGET
market. I-TARGET

Before O
leaving, O
I O
bought O
fruits O
(very O
delicious). O

Thanks O
to O
the O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
we O
stayed O
very O
pleased O
and O
had O
a O
great O
evening! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
will O
visit O
your O
house B-TARGET
often!!! O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants. B-TARGET

I O
have O
visited O
it O
since O
I O
lived O
there O
before. O

At O
the O
opening, O
they O
gave O
a O
20% O
discount O
card O
as O
a O
gift, O
and O
this O
became O
a O
motivation O
for O
frequent O
visits. O

Everything O
is O
always O
very O
delicious: O
borst B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
smoked I-TARGET
foods, I-TARGET
rolls B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill, O
salty O
Philadelphia. B-TARGET

My O
young O
man O
was O
skeptical O
of O
my O
feedback O
until O
I O
brought O
him O
there. O

They O
ate O
the O
ribay, B-TARGET
and O
then O
concluded O
that O
it O
was O
better O
than O
in O
some O
steak O
houses. O

My O
favorite O
caesar O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
was O
also O
good. O

Portions B-TARGET
large, O
beautiful O
plates, B-TARGET
good O
service. B-TARGET

On O
service B-TARGET
separately: O
there O
are O
waiters B-TARGET
who O
work O
from O
the O
very O
opening O
– O
this O
is O
also O
a O
good O
indicator O
of O
quality. O

The B-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
from O
the O
opening. O

Even O
business B-TARGET
lunch I-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

I O
can’t O
say O
anything O
about O
dessert. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
quiet, O
in O
beige-brown O
tones, O
but O
not O
cheap, O
you O
won't O
say O
that O
this O
is O
some O
kind O
of O
cafe O
at O
the O
"fuck O
on O
the O
knives." O

There O
has O
never O
been O
a O
disappointment O
in O
all O
this O
time! O

This O
is O
not O
the O
advertisement O
of O
this O
institution B-TARGET
or O
any O
other O
piar, O
because O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
this O
institution. O

I O
have O
long O
wanted O
to O
say O
thank O
you! O

I O
want O
you O
to O
be O
located O
closer O
to O
the O
center O
or O
in O
the O
center, O
because O
I O
live O
in O
the O
center. O

Please O
stay O
on O
the O
same O
level! O

A O
random O
recall. O

Coincidentally, O
because O
it O
was O
the O
only O
time. O

We O
arrived O
in O
a O
large O
company O
on O
the O
evening O
of O
February O
5. O

They O
meet, O
accompany O
with O
all O
the O
composition. O

Smile O
and O
try O
everything O
in O
the O
menu. O

You O
have O
already O
eaten O
one O
dessert, O
well, O
take O
another. O

Kind O
to O
the O
limit. O

They O
tell O
about O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
dishes, O
they O
advise, O
in O
one O
word: O
pleasant O
in O
communication. O

They O
bring, O
take, O
serve, O
you O
don’t O
rub, O
and O
it’s O
almost O
when O
the O
hall O
is O
full. O

Of O
the O
minor O
disadvantages, O
it O
is O
worth O
noting, O
the O
meals O
were O
waiting O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
but O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
serving O
us O
smoothed O
all O
the O
corners. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
evening O
was O
successful, O
thank O
you O
Polente. B-TARGET

I O
recently O
visited O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
friend. O

Interesting O
menu, B-TARGET
especially O
pleased O
with O
the O
price-quality O
ratio. O

I O
liked O
the O
soup B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
bread, I-TARGET
I O
have O
never O
tried O
it O
anywhere, O
very O
unusual O
and O
delicious. O

Pleasant O
interior, B-TARGET
smiling O
staff, B-TARGET
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

There O
is O
also O
a O
children’s B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
in O
one O
of O
the O
rooms. O

So O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
not O
only O
for O
those O
who O
just O
want O
to O
eat O
delicious O
and O
inexpensive O
food, O
but O
also O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
go O
out O
to O
rest O
with O
the O
whole O
family))). O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
were O
in O
this O
restaurant O
yesterday, O
celebrating O
six O
months O
of O
marriage. O

Many O
heard O
good O
reviews, O
about O
the O
high O
quality O
of O
service, O
the O
perfect O
kitchen. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
a O
party. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
many O
restaurants O
in O
St. O
Petersburg O
and O
other O
countries. O

To O
the O
service B-TARGET
really O
no O
complaints O
everything O
was O
great O
(of O
course O
a O
long O
wait, O
but O
decent O
food O
can O
be O
waited), O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
this O
kind O
I O
like, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
terrible O
(we O
may O
not O
be O
lucky). O

Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
the O
whole O
plate O
is O
salad B-TARGET
leaves, I-TARGET
a O
little O
bacon B-TARGET
around O
the O
circle O
and O
all O
this O
in O
sauce, B-TARGET
on O
top O
of O
cheese B-TARGET
(Caesar O
is O
prepared O
with O
chicken). O

Then O
there O
were O
scratches B-TARGET
like O
nothing, O
but O
given O
with O
vinegar, B-TARGET
the O
purple B-TARGET
was O
salted O
with O
it. O

The O
last O
dish O
was O
a O
calf O
and O
to O
it O
a O
potato O
cottage, O
the O
calf B-TARGET
also O
gave O
vinegar O
in O
a O
potato B-TARGET
cottage I-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
hair O
of O
an O
animal O
or O
a O
person. O

The O
waitress O
was O
given O
this O
hair. O

We O
got O
a O
10% O
discount, B-TARGET
probably O
because O
of O
the O
hair. O

In O
general, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
very O
hungry, O
I O
ate O
a O
spoonful O
of O
every O
meal. B-TARGET

The O
husband O
ordered O
a O
snack B-TARGET
and O
beef, B-TARGET
and O
the O
same O
gave O
everything O
with O
vinegar. O

remained O
dissatisfied. O

Unfortunately, O
I O
could O
not O
try O
the O
famous O
oysters, B-TARGET
they O
were O
finished. O

Fresh-pressed B-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
and O
bread B-TARGET
were O
delicious O
(such O
bread B-TARGET
I O
had O
never O
eaten) O

They O
went, O
looked, O
and O
ate. O

We O
will O
not O
go O
again. O

I O
have O
not O
been O
in O
such O
a O
horrible O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time. O

Service B-TARGET
simply O
does O
not O
climb O
into O
any O
framework, O
officers B-TARGET
simply O
do O
not O
pay O
any O
attention O
to O
you, O
and O
if O
you O
still O
manage O
to O
catch O
someone, O
then O
you O
are O
looked O
at O
with O
such O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
face. O

On O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
meal B-TARGET
itself, O
no O
dish B-TARGET
caused O
admiration. O

Due O
to O
the O
circumstances, O
I O
have O
been O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
not O
once, O
but O
somehow O
every O
time O
I O
am O
convinced O
of O
my O
first O
impression. O

One O
day, O
when O
ordering O
soup B-TARGET
from O
the O
menu, O
the O
waitress O
said O
that O
you O
should O
order O
another, O
as O
this O
sketch O
(!!!). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
dark, O
not O
everyone O
will O
like O
it O
too. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
going O
to O
this O
place. B-TARGET

In O
the O
same O
street O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
quality O
establishments. O

Hi O
to O
you!! O

We O
visited O
Twins B-TARGET
yesterday O
with O
a O
friend, O
overall O
it O
was O
very O
much O
liked!! O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
(seemingly O
Eugene) O
was O
just O
wonderful: O
he O
met, O
sat O
down, O
immediately O
submitted O
the O
menu, O
asked O
if O
to O
bring O
drinks, O
then O
liked O
the O
food O
and O
generally O
all O
night O
appeared O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
was O
necessary!! O

I O
can’t O
say O
anything O
bad O
about O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
it’s O
the O
most O
ordinary! O

We O
ordered O
2 O
America O
Maca, O
a O
chicken O
salad O
and O
a O
strawberry O
tea O
in O
the O
tea O
bar. O

America B-TARGET
- O
the O
taste O
is O
good, O
but O
little O
fish, B-TARGET
chicken B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
- O
good, O
tea B-TARGET
- O
did O
not O
like! O

The O
evening O
was O
pleased, O
next O
time O
you O
can O
go O
in O
front O
of O
the O
club O
to O
try O
cocktails!!)) O

I O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
several O
times O
with O
my O
friends. O

Not O
even O
very O
bad! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
cute, O
only O
in O
moderation. O

I O
liked O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

The O
last O
time O
it O
was O
on O
January O
21st, O
it O
was O
great! O

There O
was O
a O
small O
company O
of O
five O
people. O

I O
liked O
the O
music, B-TARGET
good O
music! B-TARGET

There O
are O
no O
complaints O
about O
service, B-TARGET
well O
received, O
spent O
at O
the O
table O
(booked O
in O
advance O
in O
the O
VIP O
zone, O
the O
cost O
is O
400 O
rubles). O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
did O
not O
wait O
long, O
very O
polite O
and O
careful! O

Really O
decent O
place! B-TARGET

I've O
only O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
once, O
but O
I'm O
happy O
to O
go O
again. O

I O
had O
dinner O
with O
my O
sister O
on O
the O
2nd O
floor. O

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
all O
brought O
away O
quickly O
and O
polite. O

Very O
liked O
the O
choice O
in O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time O
could O
not O
decide O
what O
to O
order O
due O
to O
the O
great O
variety B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

Everything O
was O
delicious, O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dinner O
came O
the O
musicians. O

I O
liked O
their O
music B-TARGET
very O
much. O

Beautiful O
but O
not O
obsessive. O
overall, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
great. O

I O
would O
love O
to O
go O
again O
not O
once! O

Frost O
and O
sunshine O
is O
a O
wonderful O
day. O

Lunch O
at O
a O
Finnish O
restaurant. O

We O
went O
to O
the O
sea! O

Well O
about O
100 O
p O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
the O
bad O
road B-TARGET
we O
know...it’s O
tolerable. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleased, O
there O
were O
many O
places: B-TARGET
no O
one O
bothered, O
a O
large O
aquarium B-TARGET
with O
beautiful O
fish O
smiled, O
people O
were O
almost O
absent, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
friendly. O

The O
windows B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
floor O
- O
the O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
bay O
is O
just O
magical!! O

Prices O
correspond O
to O
this O
facility. B-TARGET

Coffee, B-TARGET
tea B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mint I-TARGET
are O
delicious. O

They O
ate O
Caesar B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tuna I-TARGET
(very O
delicious O
tuna), B-TARGET
soup-pure B-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
(after O
which, O
apparently, O
a O
berry B-TARGET
sorbet I-TARGET
was O
served O
as O
a O
compliment) O
and O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood I-TARGET
- O
all O
very O
delicious. O

I O
ordered O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
and O
was O
very O
pleased!!! O

I O
haven’t O
eaten O
this O
delicious O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time! O

They O
serve O
quickly. O

I O
did O
not O
notice O
minuses. O

When O
they O
brought O
the O
bill, O
they O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised: O
it O
turns O
out, O
the O
weekend O
bill O
is O
50% O
cheaper O
from O
13 O
to O
17 O
p.m., O
and O
we O
had O
already O
thought O
that O
the O
waiters O
were O
wrong O
in O
our O
favor)) O

I O
liked O
the B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
and O
it O
is O
free. O

In O
general, O
both O
romantic O
and O
fun O
company O
to O
sit O
there O
is O
quite O
pleasant. O

We O
wait O
for O
the O
summer O
to O
come O
to O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

I’ve O
been O
to O
the O
pub B-TARGET
a O
couple O
of O
times O
and O
I O
really O
liked O
it. O

Great O
beer B-TARGET
and O
cheese B-TARGET
bars. I-TARGET

and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

I O
was O
with O
my O
husband O
in O
a O
restaurant O
twice. O

He O
celebrated O
his O
birthday. O

His O
husband O
is O
Spanish, O
and O
he O
just O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

It O
is O
valued O
at O
five O
points. O

For O
me, O
the O
disadvantage O
was O
that O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
themselves O
were O
too O
specific. O

With O
the O
addition O
of O
berries B-TARGET
or O
fruit B-TARGET
and O
too O
many O
spices B-TARGET
in O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
so O
it O
was O
unfortunately O
difficult O
for O
me O
to O
eat O
it O
personally. O

Eaten O
by O
husband. O

and O
sorry. O

For O
meat, O
i O
mean O
steak, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
separately. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
never O
eaten O
such O
a O
delicious O
steak. B-TARGET

Soft, O
soft O
and O
cut O
like O
oil. O

European O
level O
of O
preparation. B-TARGET

At O
the O
same O
time, O
my O
husband O
prefers O
half B-TARGET
raw I-TARGET
meat, I-TARGET
as O
he O
was O
served, O
and O
I O
am O
well O
done. O

When O
they O
came O
for O
the O
second O
time, O
the O
husband O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
this, O
did O
they O
change O
the O
cook? B-TARGET

But O
when O
I O
noticed O
that O
the O
steak B-TARGET
was O
also O
made O
great, O
I O
was O
pleased. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
tartar B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
raw I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
raw I-TARGET
eggs. I-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
wary, O
the O
environment B-TARGET
is O
beautiful. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
of O
high O
level. O

We O
have O
been O
regular O
visitors O
to O
this O
site B-TARGET
for O
over O
a O
year. O

The O
main O
thing O
I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
is O
the O
constant O
high O
quality B-TARGET
of O
the O
kitchen. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places B-TARGET
where O
you O
want O
to O
try O
it O
all O
at O
once. O

We O
definitely O
recommend O
trying O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls. B-TARGET

They O
are O
flavoured, O
cooked O
quickly, O
always O
fresh O
and O
very O
delicious! O

An O
amazing O
feature O
for O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
chain I-TARGET
is O
that O
in O
other O
restaurants O
(Komendantskiy, O
Petrogradskiy) O
the O
level O
of O
service B-TARGET
and O
cuisine B-TARGET
remains O
at O
the O
same O
level. O

This O
is O
especially O
clear O
if O
you O
are O
a O
regular O
visitor O
to O
Palok O
or O
Eurasia O
=)) O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
note O
from O
the O
negative O
is O
that O
in O
the O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
it O
is O
cold O
when O
the O
entrance O
door O
opens, O
but O
this O
is O
a O
little O
bit. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time O
- O
be O
sure O
to O
try O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
clearance O
- O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city. O

It O
is O
not O
hot B-TARGET
once O
in O
a O
while. O

Sometimes O
they O
bring O
cold. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
sometimes O
bring O
everything O
at O
once: O
and O
sushi O
and O
soup O
and O
dessert. O

Hopefully O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
will O
be O
as O
high, O
still O
a O
favorite O
restaurant! B-TARGET

After O
a O
walk O
decided O
to O
go O
and O
eat O
with O
a O
friend, O
this O
restaurant O
was O
the O
last O
time O
a O
long O
time O
4 O
years O
ago, O
I O
remember O
that O
the O
most O
delicious O
pizza B-TARGET
on O
a O
thin O
paste O
I O
ate O
in O
Da O
Albertone, O
but O
since O
then O
I O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
visit O
this O
Italian O
place, O
very O
happy O
that O
they O
still O
exist, O
and O
developed. O

Overall, O
the O
impressions O
were O
quite O
pleasant. O

At O
the O
entrance, O
we O
were O
immediately O
met O
by O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
and O
the O
wardrobe B-TARGET
worker, I-TARGET
courteously O
distributed. O

The O
room O
is O
in O
Japanese O
style. O

I O
ordered O
Carbonara O
pasta O
and O
Philadelphia O
roll. O

And O
for O
dessert O
decided O
to O
take O
Tiramisu, O
of O
course. O

The B-TARGET
Carbonara. I-TARGET

Beautiful, O
smelling, O
smelling O
– O
this O
pasta B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
tried!!! O

Philadelphia B-TARGET
I O
only O
managed O
to O
try, O
made O
on O
great, O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
salmon-philadelphia-a B-TARGET
little I-TARGET
rice, I-TARGET
I O
will O
boldly O
take O
the O
next O
time O
Tiramisu B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
just O
melted O
in O
my O
mouth))) O

A O
classic O
cubicle. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
pleased O
- O
a O
warm, O
cozy O
and O
quiet O
place. B-TARGET

The O
background O
music B-TARGET
did O
not O
hinder O
the O
conversation. O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
in O
a O
woman's B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
that O
it O
is O
not O
cleaned O
very O
often. O

Uranium B-TARGET
is O
completely O
filled. O

Here O
I O
am O
writing O
a O
review O
about O
the O
Dacia O
restaurant))) O

Celebrate O
the O
birthday! O

A O
separate O
VIP O
room O
was O
ordered O
for O
14 O
people. O

Everyone O
had O
enough O
space, O
the O
table B-TARGET
was O
well O
served, O
it O
was O
comfortable O
and O
comfortable. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
I O
personally, O
very O
impressed, O
my O
guests O
were O
also O
pleased. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
not O
bad, O
but O
I O
expected O
more. O

In O
the O
hot, O
many O
ordered O
pork B-TARGET
and O
calf B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
but O
unfortunately, O
both O
were O
dried O
and O
honestly O
not O
delicious((( O

And O
here O
is O
the O
fish B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
bacon O
- O
pleased))) O

About O
salads B-TARGET
to O
write O
really O
nothing, O
not O
very O
much. O

Cold B-TARGET
snacks I-TARGET
are O
quite O
edible. O

There O
was O
a O
cake, B-TARGET
ordered O
separately O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
" O
cheesecake", O
unfortunately O
it O
was O
not O
very O
good O
too))) O

And O
for O
1800 O
rubles. O
I O
think O
it O
could O
be O
made O
and O
more O
delicious, O
and O
more O
gentle, O
and O
more O
beautiful O
( O

Here O
is... O

The O
musical B-TARGET
accompaniment I-TARGET
is O
a O
separate O
story. O

Well, O
we O
didn’t O
want O
their O
hardware B-TARGET
to O
work O
as O
we O
wanted, O
and O
we O
couldn’t O
listen O
to O
our O
discs O
either. O

In O
short, O
this O
evening O
was O
very O
dark!! O

I O
wanted O
to O
dance, O
but... O

They O
served O
well, O
the O
girls B-TARGET
were O
very O
cute. O

Overall, O
there O
is O
no O
bad O
impression. O

Although O
a O
lot O
would O
need O
to O
be O
adjusted, O
and O
the O
kitchen O
and O
equipment O
to O
buy O
new. O

I’ve O
been O
to O
Dacia B-TARGET
twice O
and O
I O
think O
I’ll O
come O
again O
if O
possible!!! O

The O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
interior, O
and O
again O
the O
interior!!! O
the O
overall O
color B-TARGET
solution I-TARGET
and O
every O
detail O
- O
just O
delightful!!! O
especially O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
popular O
now O
minimalism, O
Dacha B-TARGET
- O
the O
most O
home-friendly O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very O
beautiful O
place. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
ideal O
for O
meeting O
friends O
for O
tea O
with O
cakes B-TARGET
- O
they O
are, O
by O
the O
way, O
also O
great)), O
and O
for O
a O
romantic O
date, O
when O
you O
want O
to O
get O
pleasure O
from O
the O
environment B-TARGET
and O
from O
communicating O
with O
your O
loved O
one, O
and O
for O
a O
small O
family O
celebration O
is O
also O
great!!! O

In O
terms O
of O
service B-TARGET
- O
since O
it O
was O
2 O
times, O
I O
can O
say O
1-1..)) O
apparently O
how O
lucky. O

However, O
this O
did O
not O
ruin O
the O
overall O
impression. O

Always O
perfectly O
clean, O
good O
appliances B-TARGET
and O
dishes, B-TARGET
pleasant O
tables, B-TARGET
clean O
windows, B-TARGET
all O
at O
the O
level. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
also O
pleased O
- O
great O
combinations, O
good O
portions, B-TARGET
and O
everything O
is O
very O
delicious. O
I'm O
a O
sweetheart, O
so O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
an O
additional O
plus!) O

For O
me O
also O
the O
advantages O
of O
steel O
- O
a O
separate O
wardrobe, B-TARGET
convenient O
zoning, B-TARGET
and O
of O
course, O
live O
chinches, B-TARGET
which O
can O
be O
fed O
with O
pink O
blades)))) O
thank O
you! O

Visited O
this O
restaurant O
in O
early O
September O
in O
the O
company O
of O
a O
lovely O
satellite. O

The O
overall O
impression O
was O
exceptionally O
positive: O
- O
it O
all O
started O
with O
booking O
a O
table O
by O
phone, O
a O
polite O
table O
manager B-TARGET
booked O
taking O
into O
account O
all O
my O
wishes; O

When O
we O
arrived, O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
friendly O
girl, B-TARGET
conducted O
to O
our O
table O
and O
delivered O
the O
menu;. O

The O
table O
was O
at O
the O
window, O
with O
a O
soft O
couch B-TARGET
: O
very O
cozy O
and O
comfortable; O

We O
made O
the O
order, O
everything O
was O
prepared O
very O
quickly: O
in O
20 O
minutes O
everything O
was O
already O
on O
the O
table; O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
but O
separately O
I O
want O
to O
point O
out O
the O
beautiful O
serving B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

After O
the O
hot, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
recommended O
a O
delicious O
dessert, B-TARGET
which O
we O
could O
not O
refuse. O

As O
a O
result, O
in O
this O
institution B-TARGET
we O
spent O
about O
2 O
hours O
of O
time, O
had O
a O
great O
dinner O
and O
talked, O
the O
stay B-TARGET
was O
cozy O
and O
romantic! O

The O
average O
cheque O
per O
person O
was O
up O
to O
1000 O
rubles. O

After O
dinner, O
we O
immediately O
decided O
that O
we O
would O
visit O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
again O
soon. O

Alexey, O
t. O
hchh255 O

Very O
interesting O
place) B-TARGET

So O
to O
say O
everything O
in O
one) O
and O
a O
bar O
and O
restaurant O
and O
a O
disco O
and O
karaoke, O
celebrating O
celebrations, O
watching O
football O
matches..all O
you O
can O
think O
of O
is O
the O
Moon O
Night) O

It O
is O
quite O
strange O
how O
such O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
was O
near O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
city. O

I O
came O
here O
at O
11 O
p.m., O
there O
is O
a O
closet, B-TARGET
but O
for O
some O
reason O
no O
one O
met O
me, O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
few O
minutes) O

Then O
came O
a O
lovely O
girl, B-TARGET
greeted, O
smiled O
and O
apologized O
for O
waiting. O

There O
are O
several O
rooms. O

I O
was O
offered O
"live O
music" O
- O
the O
bish O
karaoke O
in O
the O
performance O
of O
guests O
and O
"disco" O
- O
al-la O
music O
in O
the O
club O
3-4 O
years O
ago) O

I O
chose O
a O
hall O
for O
discos O
- O
noisy O
music B-TARGET
- O
if O
you O
can O
do O
more O
quietly, O
I O
liked O
the O
comfortable O
sofas B-TARGET
and O
table B-TARGET
serving. I-TARGET

The O
only O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
little O
cold O
because O
it O
blows O
from O
the O
doors O
and O
windows. O

At O
11 O
p.m. O
there O
were O
two O
tables. O

Nice, O
you O
will O
say O
nothing. O

The O
kitchen. O

I O
ordered O
a O
pork. O

They O
brought O
on B-TARGET
coals I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
potatoes..mm.. I-TARGET
really, O
very O
delicious...and O
wine, B-TARGET
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
girl B-TARGET
could O
not O
explain O
what O
wine, O
limited O
only O
to O
"well O
it O
is O
good"..yes, O
white B-TARGET
semi-sweet I-TARGET
very O
impressive)) O

Cheap, O
democratic O
prices O
(250 O
shale B-TARGET
+ O
150 O
wine) B-TARGET
for O
such O
quality O
pleased..I O
will O
come O
here O
once O
more..and O
not O
even O
one) O

I O
went O
there O
yesterday. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
unusual, O
attractive. O

And O
it O
was O
very O
cold O
in O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
itself, O
although O
they O
had O
condys, O
they O
turned O
them O
on O
to O
heat, O
only O
when O
we O
insisted, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
save, O
the O
hands O
simply O
frozen! O

From O
the O
kitchen O
ordered O
pizza, B-TARGET
so..... O
nothing O
special, O
you O
can O
eat, O
there O
was O
no O
doping, B-TARGET
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
add O
=( O

I O
wanted O
to O
order O
another O
dessert, O
so O
they O
didn’t O
get O
any O
fruit B-TARGET
either. O

I O
ordered O
tea B-TARGET
and O
it O
tasted O
the O
cheapest. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
always O
missing O
somewhere, O
although O
the O
people O
were O
not O
there O
at O
all. O

Another O
thing O
I O
didn’t O
like O
is O
that O
the O
cook O
goes O
right O
through O
all O
the O
cafes, O
there O
and O
there. O

I O
don’t O
like O
this O
place, B-TARGET
I O
won’t O
go O
there O
again. O

I O
was O
there O
the O
last O
time O
a O
month O
ago O
at O
4 O
p.m. O

The O
tables O
were O
almost O
all O
busy, O
ordered O
soup, B-TARGET
if O
not O
long O
and O
it O
was O
delicious, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
there O
was O
not O
when O
I O
did O
not O
complain, O
always O
bring O
a O
compliment O
from O
the O
chef, O
and O
as O
for O
spaghetti, B-TARGET
you O
can O
order O
half O
a O
portion O
if O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to! O

The O
restaurant O
itself O
is O
not O
very O
large, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
pleasant, O
as O
it O
is O
all O
comfortable O
there! O

But O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
minus, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
on O
the O
street O
of O
the O
insurrection O
and O
unfortunately, O
there O
is O
no O
place O
to O
park O
and O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
find O
a O
place O
at O
least O
nearby, O
and O
that O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
that O
in O
the O
evening! O

I O
visited O
this O
house O
on O
Sunday O
with O
a O
friend. O

We O
chose O
this O
restaurant O
because O
we O
live O
nearby. O

At O
first O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
- O
as O
if O
they O
were O
not O
very O
impressed, O
but O
decided O
to O
check O
for O
yourself... O

We O
really B-TARGET
it!! I-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
all O
in O
beautiful O
shapes, O
very O
friendly. O

I O
ordered O
and O
prepared O
to O
wait. O

We O
got O
the O
beer O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
and O
then O
we O
got O
the O
salad. O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
this O
speed B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
service.) I-TARGET

Salad B-TARGET
with O
your O
fingers!! O

I O
took O
with O
smoked B-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
– O
SUPER!!! O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
very O
kind. O

A O
friend O
ordered O
fish O
roulette, O
and O
brought O
roulette B-TARGET
and O
a O
mountain O
salad!!! B-TARGET

Then O
served O
sorbet, B-TARGET
also O
delicious))) O

In O
the O
hot O
ordered O
milk O
calf O
with O
a O
garner. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
just O
melted O
in O
the O
mouth. O

Unfortunately, O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
room O
in O
the O
stomach O
for O
dessert O
((( O

So O
I O
can O
say O
nothing O
here. O

I O
haven’t O
had O
such O
a O
pleasure O
in O
going O
to O
a O
restaurant! B-TARGET

I O
liked O
everything O
- O
the O
environment, B-TARGET
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
at O
the O
height! O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
will O
definitely O
be O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
😉 O

Although O
there O
is O
one O
minus... O

There O
is O
no O
non-smoking B-TARGET
zone I-TARGET
( O

But O
the O
smoke O
did O
not O
smell O
(we O
were O
from O
16 O
to O
18). O

thank O
you! O

I O
recently O
moved O
to O
Pushkin. O

There O
was O
absolutely O
no O
time O
to O
even O
walk O
around O
the O
park, O
I’m O
not O
talking O
about O
any O
restaurants. O

Recently O
I O
was O
lucky O
and O
I O
had O
time O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Yekaterinsky O
Park. O

The O
weather O
was O
terrible, O
I O
decided O
to O
hide O
in O
a O
cozy O
cafe. O

I O
approached O
the O
first O
person O
going O
to O
the O
meeting O
and O
asked O
where O
there O
is O
a O
good O
place O
to O
drink O
coffee. O

The O
man O
answered O
without O
hesitation O
that O
there O
is O
a O
wonderful O
White-Rabbit B-TARGET
cafe I-TARGET
on O
Moscow O
Street. O

Arriving O
there, O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
very O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
I O
pay O
tribute O
to O
the O
owners O
and O
the O
designer! B-TARGET

That O
day O
I O
drank O
American B-TARGET
(per O
the O
most O
delicious) O
and O
ate O
Philadelphia, B-TARGET
I O
was O
satisfied, O
the O
foods B-TARGET
were O
fresh, O
the O
coffee B-TARGET
smelled! O

A O
week O
later O
I O
went O
out O
with O
a O
friend, O
ordered O
2 O
steaks O
(striplains) O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
red O
wine. O

Such O
steaks B-TARGET
are O
rarely O
found O
in O
the O
SPB, O
very O
delicious! O

Everything O
very O
liked! O

By O
the O
way, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
they O
are O
not O
visible, O
but O
the O
plates O
disappear O
immediately! O

I O
think O
to O
go O
for O
the O
evening O
of O
Italian O
wine O
Novello. O

Thank O
you O
for O
such O
a O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
in O
Pushkin! O

and O
luck! O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place, B-TARGET
my O
husband O
and O
I O
are O
delighted! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
the O
most O
delicious O
( O
portions B-TARGET
are O
actually O
less O
than O
in O
other O
Italian O
restaurants) O
but O
we O
stayed O
very O
happy, O
even O
hugged, O
my O
husband O
especially O
noted O
carpacho, B-TARGET
and O
I O
dessert B-TARGET
"three I-TARGET
chocolates" I-TARGET
full O
enthusiasm!!! O

But O
especially O
wanted O
to O
stop O
at O
the O
service, B-TARGET
thanks O
to O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Maxim, O
we O
were O
very O
pleased! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
institution O
was O
also O
pleased, O
played O
pleasant O
Italian B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
in O
general O
the O
highest O
rating O
of O
the B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
wait O
for O
us O
again, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come)))) O

I O
visited O
this O
institution O
today. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
normal, O
I O
would O
even O
say O
that O
everything O
was O
deliciously O
cooked. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
but... O

While O
the O
restaurant O
was O
almost O
empty O
order, O
I O
waited O
for O
more O
than O
forty O
minutes O
plus O
everything, O
about O
one O
dessert O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
completely O
forgot O
and O
carried O
it O
for O
another O
20 O
minutes. O

And O
what O
was O
most O
surprised O
and O
not O
liked, O
that O
in O
the O
menu O
in O
the O
dessert O
was O
written O
some O
ingredients, O
and O
the O
real O
dish B-TARGET
part O
of O
the O
ingredients O
I O
never O
found! O

So O
if O
anyone O
gathers O
there O
for O
lunch O
or O
dinner, O
then O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
order O
you O
can O
wait O
very O
long! O

We O
came O
there O
with O
my O
husband O
for O
lunch, O
full O
of O
places, O
served O
quickly. O

Very O
nice O
waitress, B-TARGET
the O
interior B-TARGET
liked, O
small O
establishment, B-TARGET
but O
still O
cute. O

The O
order O
waited O
for O
15 O
minutes, O
brought O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
sushi, B-TARGET
very O
delicious. O

They O
have O
an O
action O
now O
until O
17 O
hours O
with O
a O
50% O
discount O
on O
them... O
here O
we O
ordered... O

The O
husband O
quickly O
sketched, O
and O
I O
ordered O
another O
portion O
of O
rolls, B-TARGET
but, O
unfortunately, O
not O
so O
delicious... O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
the O
intricate O
name, O
but O
were O
with O
green O
onions O
and O
black O
pepper... O
untasteful, O
dry... O
and O
so O
quite O
great. O

Of O
all O
the O
establishments O
of O
the O
Japanese B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
- O
this O
is O
the O
best, O
we O
will O
come O
there O
again O
until O
November O
20... O
by O
action!!!! O

The O
toilet B-TARGET
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
availability O
of O
a O
couch O
))))))) O

Don’t O
judge O
a O
man O
by O
his O
clothes O
– O
May O
9 O

A O
dark, O
but O
warm O
Peter's O
evening. O

In O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
decided O
to O
walk O
around O
the O
center, O
to O
eat O
decided O
in O
Tefsi, O
since O
they O
were O
nearby O
and O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
good. O

We O
were O
met O
at O
the O
entrance O
surprised, O
as O
we O
looked O
like O
teenagers), O
but O
as O
they O
say O
in O
our O
company O
"we O
can O
afford")). O

I O
will O
not O
talk O
about O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
as O
probably O
in O
the O
previous O
reviews O
everything O
has O
already O
been O
written, O
I O
can O
say O
one O
thing-liked, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
also O
delighted O
us O
- O
hatchapuri B-TARGET
great, O
hinkali B-TARGET
large, O
but O
the O
meat B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
dried, O
baked B-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
excellent, O
lilium B-TARGET
not O
bad, O
but O
not O
enough O
sauce, B-TARGET
and O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
did O
not O
offer O
to O
order O
it. O

Here O
and O
all O
the O
good O
ends, O
because O
the O
service B-TARGET
in O
this O
institution O
at O
zero, O
the O
dishes O
were O
not O
brought O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
in O
the O
end O
I O
ate, O
when O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
their O
dishes O
were O
already O
eaten, O
dirty O
plates O
from O
the O
table O
were O
not O
cleaned, O
but O
most O
importantly, O
when O
they O
brought O
the O
delivery O
check O
was O
not, O
immediately O
all O
the O
good O
impressions O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
evaporated, O
of O
course O
nobody O
came O
to O
us O
anymore, O
and O
when O
we O
left O
nobody O
said O
goodbye O
to O
us. O

The O
tea O
workers O
did O
not O
leave, O
because O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
this O
institution B-TARGET
has O
already O
earned O
themselves O
for O
"tea". O

On O
July O
31, O
we O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
at O
the O
restaurant O
in O
Andante. O

We O
approached O
the O
choice O
of O
a O
restaurant O
thoroughly, O
there O
were O
many O
different O
offers, O
but O
nothing O
better O
than O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
found. O

Everything O
begins O
from O
the O
first O
call O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
communication O
with O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
and O
ends O
with O
our O
collection O
after O
the O
banquet. O

Always O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
at O
any O
time, O
in O
personal O
communication O
and O
by O
phone. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
several O
menu B-TARGET
options, O
on O
any O
wallet, O
in O
each O
of O
the O
menus, O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
everything, O
hot B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cold I-TARGET
snacks, I-TARGET
hot B-TARGET
drinks. B-TARGET

My O
guests, O
as O
well O
as O
us O
young O
people, O
were O
delighted!!!) O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
superb, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
delightful, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
the O
best, O
the O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
restaurant O
is O
great! O

I O
recommend O
to O
everyone! O

Thanks O
to O
the O
administration! B-TARGET

Today O
was O
the O
first O
time! O

Everything O
very O
liked. O

And O
a O
place O
on O
the O
sofas O
was O
found, O
and O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly, O
but O
non-obsessive, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
is O
also O
relaxing, O
well O
under O
her O
you O
can O
have O
a O
conversation. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
prompt, O
wait O
1-2 O
minutes O
for O
a O
beer, O
a O
little O
longer, O
a O
good O
beer!!! B-TARGET

The O
location O
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
I O
am O
delighted O
that O
there O
is O
such O
a O
beautiful O
facility B-TARGET
near O
the O
house!!! O

Yesterday O
we O
celebrated O
my O
mother’s O
birthday O
with O
a O
company O
of O
six O
people. O

We O
booked O
a O
table O
the O
day O
before, O
then O
agreed O
to O
prepare O
snacks O
for O
our O
arrival. O

We O
arrived O
a O
little O
earlier, O
but O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
:) O

We O
liked O
the O
snacks B-TARGET
so O
much O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
taste O
everything O
we O
could O
and O
ordered O
them O
in O
some O
wild O
quantities, O
so, O
unfortunately, O
there O
was O
no O
room O
for O
hot O
(I O
generally O
went O
for O
beef, O
but O
it O
didn’t O
work, O
so O
we’ll O
come O
again))). O

For O
dessert O
ordered O
sorbe, O
its O
serving B-TARGET
- O
a O
whole O
ritual! O

And O
the O
taste O
was O
great, O
we O
had O
peanuts B-TARGET
and O
mango. B-TARGET

Overall, O
we O
are O
very O
pleased, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
and O
this O
time O
leave O
a O
place O
for O
meat O
=) O

Quiet O
and O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
pleasant O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
attentive O
but O
non-obsessive O
service, B-TARGET
excellent O
food B-TARGET
- O
all O
on O
a O
solid O
10! O

Marina O
and O
Katya, O
thank O
you O
for O
a O
great O
evening, O
we O
hope O
to O
visit O
you O
again O
:-) O

I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
this O
birthday O
with O
my O
family, O
wife O
and O
brother. O

In O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ordered O
a O
table, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
convenient-despite O
the O
working O
day, O
the O
veranda O
was O
fully O
occupied. O

At O
the O
entrance O
a O
smiling O
girl B-TARGET
hostess I-TARGET
met O
and O
conducted O
to O
the O
table O
pleasantly. O

It O
was O
served O
by O
the O
young O
man O
Anton. O

When O
choosing O
dishes O
there O
was O
a O
little O
panic, O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
everything))) O

I O
chose O
sacivi B-TARGET
(cold O
tried O
for O
the O
first O
time O
– O
amazingly, O
very O
delicate O
taste), O
hatchapuri B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
megreel I-TARGET
(heavier O
than O
cheese O
pizza)))), O
snack O
on O
mangal, O
well O
the O
guys O
took O
all O
sorts O
of O
snacks O
and O
salads, O
I O
just O
don’t O
remember O
what O
exactly. O

For O
dessert, O
the O
wife O
took O
the O
classic O
Napoleon, B-TARGET
tried O
it O
and O
condemned O
it-like O
in O
childhood, O
taste))) O

I O
decided O
to O
try O
the O
lamb O
testicles-not O
impressed O
because O
they O
were O
frozen, O
taste O
completely O
different O
than O
it O
should O
be. O

In O
other O
words, O
the O
cooks B-TARGET
are O
good. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Anton O
worked O
clearly, O
without O
significant O
delays O
and O
in O
no O
hurry. O

It O
is O
very O
pleasant O
when O
a O
good O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
not O
deceived O
by O
poor O
service. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
homey O
and O
very O
cozy, O
the O
toilet B-TARGET
in O
general O
is O
great, O
and O
the O
fairy O
tales O
playing O
there O
relax)))) O

As O
a O
result, O
we O
because O
of O
the O
abundance O
of O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
barely O
got O
up O
from O
behind O
the O
table, O
were O
satisfied, O
full O
and O
a O
little O
drunk))) O

Thank O
you O
huge. O

I O
recently O
visited O
a O
restaurant O
for O
the O
first O
time! O

At O
the O
arrival O
met O
a O
cute O
girl B-TARGET
offered O
tables O
to O
choose O
from! O

I O
decided O
to O
drink O
wine O
and O
asked O
the O
waitress O
what O
wine O
to O
advise O
me, O
obviously O
the O
menu O
in O
this O
restaurant O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
do O
not O
teach, O
nothing O
about O
wine O
she O
could O
not O
explain O
to O
me! O

I O
chose O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
myself, O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
salad O
of O
rucola O
with O
baked O
potatoes O
and O
sparrows! O

I O
was O
surprised O
when O
a O
compliment O
from O
the O
chef O
was O
brought O
before O
the O
salad, O
although O
my O
enthusiasm O
was O
not O
long, O
the O
salad O
was O
taken O
to O
me O
for O
40 O
minutes O
if O
not O
more, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
was O
for O
4, O
after O
which O
I O
waited O
for O
another O
30 O
minutes, O
the O
dessert O
wasn’t O
even O
ordered! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
but O
on O
the O
2nd O
floor O
it O
is O
very O
dull! O

This O
is O
a O
great O
pub!! B-TARGET

I O
decided O
to O
make O
a O
surprise O
to O
my O
husband O
and O
he O
succeeded. O

Excellent O
interior! B-TARGET

Very O
delicious O
beer B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
selection, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
also O
great, O
all O
the O
meals B-TARGET
ordered O
were O
very O
delicious, O
and O
the O
main O
reason O
I O
chose O
this O
pub, O
because O
that O
day O
was O
playing O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised, O
a O
great O
concert B-TARGET
resulted! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
great, O
we O
will O
definitely O
visit O
it O
again!!! O

For O
me, O
the O
answer O
to O
the O
question O
"Is O
it O
worth O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant?" B-TARGET
is O
unambiguous. O

Yes, O
of O
course O
it O
is O
worth O
it! O

There O
are O
many O
reasons O
for O
this: O
One O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
is O
a O
good O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Attentive O
staff, B-TARGET
adequate O
prices, O
cozy O
and O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
city O
centre. O

I O
like O
the O
place O
where O
there O
is O
a O
restaurant. B-TARGET
(Over O
the O
Little O
Drama O
Theatre.) O

The B-TARGET
audience I-TARGET
that O
comes O
here O
likes O
me O
too. O

Good O
energy O
in O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
is O
created O
by O
attentive O
and O
professional O
people. B-TARGET

It’s O
a O
pity O
that O
many O
people O
don’t O
know O
about O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Here O
you O
feel O
very O
good O
at O
any O
time O
and O
in O
any O
hall, B-TARGET
be O
it O
a O
big O
party O
(such O
as O
a O
banquet)) O
or O
if O
you O
accidentally O
come O
in O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee. O

You O
are O
always O
happy O
here, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
home O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

Such O
nice O
and O
cozy O
places B-TARGET
in O
Peter O
are O
not O
so O
many. O

I O
think O
the O
guest O
who O
visits O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
will O
be O
its O
regular O
guest. O

I O
wish O
the O
Rubinstein B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
prosperity O
and O
success! O

With O
respect O
Irina O

I O
went O
to O
this O
establishment. O

There O
were O
no O
negative O
impressions. O

It O
seemed O
strange O
a O
small O
selection O
of O
pizzas, B-TARGET
given O
the O
Italian O
restaurant O
claimed O
in O
the O
name. O

The O
taste O
of O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

Overall, O
it O
wasn’t O
disgusting, O
but O
we O
ate O
better. O

So O
much O
better O
with O
sushi. B-TARGET

The O
prices, O
of O
course, O
are O
not O
small, O
corresponding O
to O
the O
name O
"RESTORAN". B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
has O
a O
place O
to O
grow, O
but O
also O
at O
the O
average O
level. O

The O
girls B-TARGET
walk O
with O
faces O
as O
if O
the O
visitors O
owe O
them O
something. O

Beginning O
with O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
and O
ending O
with O
the O
administrators. B-TARGET

If O
administrators B-TARGET
do O
not O
confuse O
themselves O
with O
a O
smile O
to O
customers, O
then O
what O
to O
expect O
from O
the O
younger B-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

Only O
the O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
rejoiced, O
smiled O
all O
the O
time O
and O
although O
he O
did O
not O
serve O
our O
table, O
but O
did O
not O
count O
for O
work O
and O
killed O
the O
dishes O
passing O
by O
us. O

Very O
long, O
no, O
very O
long O
cooked O
/ O
brought O
sushi, O
from O
the O
moment O
the O
order O
has O
passed, O
probably O
minutes O
40-50... O

Even O
more O
unpleasant O
seemed O
the O
fact O
that O
at O
15.50 O
we O
did O
not O
accept O
the O
order O
for O
lunch, O
although O
in O
the O
menu O
it O
was O
stated O
until O
16.00... O

In O
general, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
quiet O
place, O
drink O
a O
glass O
and O
talk O
to O
friends, O
then O
Rosario B-TARGET
is O
perfectly O
suitable. O

If O
your O
goal O
is O
to O
eat O
delicious O
and O
inexpensive O
pizza, B-TARGET
then O
this O
establishment O
is O
better O
not O
to O
visit. O

We O
celebrated O
the O
birthday, O
all O
liked O
it, O
managed O
to O
find O
a O
place B-TARGET
that O
would O
combine O
a O
cozy O
interior B-TARGET
(first B-TARGET
room), I-TARGET
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
pleasant O
staff B-TARGET
and O
very O
democratic O
prices O
(at O
the O
expense O
of O
a O
33% O
discount O
in O
honor O
of O
the O
birthday), O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
very O
strange O
moments. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
closes O
at O
half O
12, O
so O
at O
some O
point O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
politely O
told O
us O
this, O
we O
were O
not O
upset, O
we O
went O
on O
to O
dance, O
but O
still..in O
the O
city O
where O
any O
institution O
works O
until O
the O
last O
customer O
is O
a O
bit O
strange. O

They O
took O
white O
Sicilian O
wine, B-TARGET
liked O
it, O
asked O
for O
the O
same, O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
there, O
took O
another, O
and O
it O
was O
also O
in O
one O
copy, O
took O
a O
third. O

As O
already O
noted, O
the O
prices O
are O
so O
democratic O
that O
when O
I O
was O
brought O
the O
bill O
I O
was O
very O
surprised O
because O
of O
the O
company O
of O
7 O
people O
(all O
ordered O
hot O
+ O
4 O
bottles O
of O
wine, O
salads) O

The O
account O
was O
slightly O
less O
than O
6tr., O
but O
when O
I O
was O
brought O
this O
same O
account O
on O
it O
with O
a O
pencil O
was O
written O
10% O
service O
and O
added O
about O
700 O
r. O

And O
already O
the O
final O
amount O
was O
recorded O
with O
a O
pencil, O
I O
gave O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
a O
bank O
card O
for O
which O
she O
asked O
me O
to O
pay O
with O
the O
card O
and O
the O
service O
in O
cash. O

We O
of O
course O
paid O
without O
problems O
(the O
check O
for O
cash, O
of O
course, O
did O
not O
bring!), O
but O
this O
is O
an O
outspoken O
extortion O
of O
the O
teasers, O
and O
we O
would O
have O
left O
them O
all O
the O
way!! O

Good O
day! O

I O
want O
to O
share O
my O
impressions O
about O
my O
daughter O
Alexandra’s O
wedding, O
which O
was O
held O
in O
your O
restaurant O
on O
August O
11, O
2012. O

If O
I O
say O
I O
liked O
it O
all, O
I O
may O
not O
believe O
it. O

But O
it O
is O
actually O
exactly O
so. O

And O
wonderful O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
beautiful O
serving B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tables, I-TARGET
and O
amazing O
kitchen, B-TARGET
and O
even O
with O
exquisite O
design! B-TARGET

And O
most O
importantly, O
these O
are O
the O
people B-TARGET
who O
work O
here O
and O
with O
whom O
we O
communicated O
on O
the O
organization O
of O
the O
wedding O
banquet. O

First O
of O
all, O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Alexander. O

Very O
polite, O
kind, O
knowing O
his O
job. O

All O
our O
wishes O
were O
taken O
into O
account. O

I O
also O
want O
to O
mention O
the O
girl B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
who O
worked O
on O
serving B-TARGET
our O
banquet O
(unfortunately O
I O
don’t O
know O
her O
name). O

The O
smart! O

Unnoticeably O
cleaned O
up O
excess O
dishes, O
new O
dishes, O
drinks O
appeared. O

All O
this O
was O
accompanied O
by O
her O
friendly O
smile. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
your O
work O
and O
such O
a O
warm O
attitude B-TARGET
to O
us, O
your O
customers. O

All O
our O
guests O
join O
my O
words O
and O
also O
express O
their O
gratitude O
for O
this O
evening. O

And O
our O
newlyweds O
are O
just O
delighted O
with O
the O
celebration O
that O
we O
all O
organized O
for O
them. O

Thank O
you O
huge! O

Success O
in O
your O
pleasant O
work! O

And O
more O
thankful O
visitors! O

With O
respect, O
Tatiana O

By O
the O
nature O
of O
my O
activity, O
I O
often O
go O
to O
the O
Moscow O
district O
and O
several O
times O
went O
to O
lunch O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

During O
the O
day O
there O
is O
a O
small O
crowd O
and O
attracts O
a O
20% O
discount B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
all I-TARGET
meals I-TARGET
up O
to O
16 O
hours. O

The B-TARGET
wardrobe I-TARGET
really O
did O
not O
work, O
but O
we O
were O
not O
stressed, O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
places O
to O
put O
clothes. O

We O
always O
choose O
the O
second B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
it O
feels O
more O
comfortable O
there. O

Interior B-TARGET
in O
Eastern O
style, O
dim O
lighting, B-TARGET
silent O
background O
music, B-TARGET
not O
interfering O
with O
conversation. O

I O
can O
say O
about O
all O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
and O
the O
range B-TARGET
there O
is O
quite O
large, O
but O
what O
we O
choose O
- O
I O
like. O

As O
the O
restaurant O
is O
Eastern, O
we O
choose O
the O
meals O
of O
the O
Eastern O
cuisine. O

All O
the O
shishels, B-TARGET
and O
we O
ordered O
them O
from O
beef B-TARGET
and O
beef B-TARGET
and O
pork, B-TARGET
were O
excellent. O

I O
like O
the O
dish B-TARGET
Sage I-TARGET
- O
meat, O
beef, O
calf O
to O
choose O
from, O
with O
mushrooms O
and O
vegetables O
served O
in O
a O
large O
metal O
plate O
on O
coal. O

Very O
delicious O
tea O
on O
the O
east B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
garlic, I-TARGET
it O
is O
true, O
quite O
expensive. O

The O
service B-TARGET
all O
three O
times O
we O
were O
there O
was O
also O
perfect. O

Gentle, O
friendly O
waiters, B-TARGET
always O
ready O
to O
suggest O
and O
advise. O

On O
my O
recommendation O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
visited O
several O
couples O
of O
my O
friends O
and O
were O
also O
pleased. O

Very O
good O
price O
and O
quality O
ratio. O

Good O
day! O

My O
young O
man O
and O
I O
love O
to O
discover O
new O
places, O
various O
restaurants, O
especially O
Italian. O

There O
were O
many O
already. O

I O
found O
a O
restaurant O
by O
rating, O
came, O
all O
the O
guests O
sat O
on O
the O
terrace O
(summer O
still), O
and O
we O
sat O
inside O
(near O
the O
air O
conditioner). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy. O

They O
sat O
right O
in O
front O
of O
the O
kitchen O
(where O
pizza O
is O
made) O
near O
the O
window. O

There O
are O
reviews O
that O
smells O
of O
the O
kitchen..but O
I O
didn't O
especially O
notice..yes O
and O
the O
light O
smell O
of O
pizza O
I O
think O
only O
will O
add O
appetite) O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
a O
good O
pizza B-TARGET
- O
took O
it, O
and O
they O
were O
very O
pleased!! O

In O
all O
Italian O
restaurants, O
I O
take O
tiramisa, O
a O
pan O
and O
go O
to O
the O
toilet. O

Thus, O
I O
give O
an O
assessment O
to O
the O
institution. O

Bread O
should O
be O
fresh, O
tyrama O
to O
melt O
in O
the O
mouth, O
and O
the O
toilets O
should O
not O
save! O

I O
liked O
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
it O
was O
magical. O

Sitting O
gently O
in O
the O
window, B-TARGET
I O
saw O
the O
Savior O
on O
Blood. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
is O
very O
polite. O

The O
drinks O
brought O
quickly...and O
the O
food O
didn’t O
have O
to O
wait O
at O
all! O
in O
general, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
catering. B-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
again! O

Friends O
advised O
the O
"City", O
so O
I O
decided, O
passing O
by, O
to O
have O
lunch O
there. O

The O
house B-TARGET
is O
bright, O
stylish. O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
the O
tables B-TARGET
(right O
of O
the O
entrance) O
are O
placed O
very O
close O
to O
each O
other, O
and O
if O
the O
table O
next O
to O
me O
was O
busy, O
I O
would O
not O
be O
so O
comfortable O
anymore. O

I O
was O
immediately O
noticed O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
led O
to O
the O
table. O

No O
complaints O
to O
service: B-TARGET
served O
quickly O
and O
with O
a O
smile! O

I O
ordered O
borscht, O
pasta, O
homemade O
profitroli O
with O
hot O
chocolate O
and O
tea. O

I O
regretted O
ordering O
my O
favourite O
borsch! B-TARGET
here O
it O
is O
not O
delicious: O
broth B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cabbage... I-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cabbage! B-TARGET
tried O
to O
add O
more O
cream O
))) O
but O
it O
didn’t O
help... O
unfortunately. O

Carbonara B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
was O
worthy!! O

And O
from O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
I O
am O
just O
delighted!!! O
dared O
it O
in O
a O
few O
minutes O
))) O
and O
this O
after O
the O
borsch O
with O
pasta!!! O

Overall O
impressions O
are O
positive, O
even O
despite O
the O
borst B-TARGET
))) O

15% O
discount O
at O
lunch B-TARGET
time. I-TARGET

Judging O
by O
the O
reviews O
"City" O
in O
the O
day O
and O
evening O
- O
two O
different O
establishments. O

I O
plan O
to O
go O
out O
one O
evening O
with O
my O
husband. O

Today O
was O
a O
company O
of O
4 O
people, O
was O
far O
from O
the O
first O
time, O
but O
only O
today O
I O
was O
going O
to O
leave O
a O
review. O

In O
order: O
Kitchen B-TARGET
- O
Soup-Harcho, B-TARGET
shrimp B-TARGET
(tested O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
presented) O
5+ O
rating, O
shrimp, B-TARGET
very O
good O
wine B-TARGET
(in O
my O
taste), O
well O
and O
of O
course O
tea B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheddar I-TARGET
:), O
this O
is O
why O
you O
are O
here O
and O
you O
need O
to O
go, O
agree O
that O
in O
such O
a O
place O
any O
Greek O
salad O
to O
take O
is O
completely O
useless, O
it O
should O
not O
be O
good O
here O
:) O

Interior B-TARGET
- O
In O
general, O
it O
is O
quite O
thematic, O
excluding O
the O
already O
mentioned O
column B-TARGET
in O
the O
hall O
and O
there O
may O
be O
a O
lack O
of O
light B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
main O
hall, O
I, O
like O
many O
who O
wrote O
here, O
like O
the O
bright B-TARGET
hall I-TARGET
more, O
it O
is O
much O
more O
cozy, O
the O
only O
thing O
is O
worth O
paying O
attention O
to O
the O
cleanliness B-TARGET
of O
the O
benches, O
not O
always O
perfect. O

Friendly, O
polite O
young B-TARGET
people, I-TARGET
not O
too O
often, O
but O
not O
rarely O
fit, O
work O
not O
heartlessly, O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
generally O
look O
organic, O
no O
complaints. O

In O
general, O
a O
pleasant O
place B-TARGET
for O
people O
to O
sit, O
both O
business O
and O
private, O
lovers O
of O
"points O
and O
dogs" O
are O
definitely O
not O
here, O
the O
institution O
does O
not O
reach O
the O
level O
to O
attract O
such O
characters, O
but O
thank O
God. O

With O
all O
written, O
the O
price O
is O
very O
adequate, O
at O
least O
for O
the O
part O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
that O
interests O
us. O

Thanks O
for O
attention. O

A O
great O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Comfortable O
environment B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
beautiful O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
bay. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
polite O
staff, B-TARGET
all O
wishes O
fulfilled. O

Delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
portions B-TARGET
were O
normal, O
cooked O
and O
brought O
pretty O
quickly. O

Overall, O
there O
were O
very O
good O
and O
pleasant O
impressions O
from O
the O
visit, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
again O
and O
not O
once. O

thank O
you! O

Hope O
of O
S. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
I O
have O
been O
there O
a O
few O
times. O

They O
cook O
very O
delicious, O
and O
very O
large O
portions. B-TARGET

I O
ate O
a O
salad, B-TARGET
if O
enough O
for O
soup, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
great! O

Especially O
good O
waitress B-TARGET
Alena, O
nice, O
kind, O
friendly O
and O
always O
help O
with O
the O
choice! O

Great O
cooks B-TARGET
cooking O
for O
the O
ur. O

I O
especially O
liked O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
shishel I-TARGET
and O
the O
salad B-TARGET
"Rozana" I-TARGET
I O
advise O
everyone O
to O
try. O

In O
fact, O
at O
12 O
a.m. O
only O
the O
kitchen O
closes, O
and O
the O
bar B-TARGET
works O
until O
the O
last O
customer! O

I O
advise O
everyone O
to O
go O
there. O

We O
met O
with O
friends O
to O
talk, O
drink O
beer. O

The O
table O
was O
ordered O
in O
advance, O
we O
were O
met, O
held, O
brought O
the O
menu O
all O
quickly. O

The O
house B-TARGET
is O
small, O
very O
room, O
which O
is O
pleasant. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
ordinary, O
as O
in O
other O
pubs, O
delighted O
with O
shelves B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
books I-TARGET
and O
soft O
sofas. B-TARGET
:) O

The O
beer B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
there O
is O
something O
to O
choose O
from. O

We O
ordered: O
boiled B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
- O
shrimp, O
like O
shrimp, O
but O
some O
too O
small O
(240 O
rub.), O
salad B-TARGET
"Salmon" I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
not O
bad, O
but O
freshwater, O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
clearly O
lacking, O
ring O
of O
calmar B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
clay O
- O
under O
beer O
is O
normal, O
beef B-TARGET
chips I-TARGET
- O
delicious, O
Ragu B-TARGET
- O
delicious, O
but O
more O
like O
a O
bouillon O
with O
meat, O
royal B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
- O
a O
very O
delicious O
dish O
(599 O
rubles), O
unfortunately O
not O
all O
the O
prices O
I O
remember. O

There O
was O
one O
waitress B-TARGET
in O
the O
whole O
hall O
(on O
Friday O
evening O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
occupied), O
but O
it O
did O
well, O
drinks O
and O
dishes O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
long, O
there O
was O
a O
little O
kindness, O
and O
in O
general O
it O
was O
good. O

Our O
account O
for O
5 O
people O
was O
about O
4 O
000 O
rubles. O

In O
summary, O
we O
can O
say O
that O
we O
had O
a O
good O
time, O
lovely O
institution. B-TARGET

The O
Atlantic B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
has O
remained O
for O
many O
years O
one O
of O
the O
most O
pleasant O
and O
cozy O
places. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
just O
beautiful, O
in O
summer O
it O
is O
very O
pleasant O
to O
be O
on O
the O
veranda. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
great! O

Dessert B-TARGET
is O
a O
delicious O
topic O
:) O

Blancanje B-TARGET
and O
Decoaz B-TARGET
are O
my O
favorites, O
I O
highly O
recommend! O

Sushi, B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
love, O
just O
super O
delicious, O
the O
most O
delicious O
in O
the O
city, O
well O
and O
beyond, O
in O
my O
opinion! O
:) O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
always O
polite, O
and O
when O
we O
celebrated O
there O
was O
not O
one O
of O
our O
holidays O
(at O
different O
times O
from O
10 O
to O
50 O
guests) O
everything O
was O
at O
the O
highest O
level, O
and O
the O
organization, B-TARGET
and O
discussion B-TARGET
of O
the O
menu, O
and O
serving B-TARGET
of O
the O
dishes. O

Reviews O
are O
like O
in O
an O
eternal O
story O
about O
whether O
the O
glass O
is O
half-full O
or O
empty O
– O
it O
all O
depends O
on O
what O
a O
person O
wants O
to O
find O
and O
see O
in O
one O
place O
or O
another. O

Either O
you O
look O
for O
dust O
on O
the O
shelves O
and O
notice O
other O
little O
things, O
or O
you O
enjoy O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
and O
everything O
around O
you. O

If O
you O
decide O
to O
spend O
a O
wonderful O
day O
or O
evening O
in O
a O
pleasant O
company O
in O
a O
cozy O
place O
with O
good O
food, B-TARGET
then O
the O
Atlantic B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
will O
help O
you. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
and O
thank O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
the O
quality O
work O
over O
the O
years! O

Good O
night! O

Dinner O
in O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
I O
personally O
very O
liked, O
something O
reminded O
me O
of O
the O
restaurant O
"Russian O
Kitch". O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
magical. O

I O
totally O
agree O
with O
NAVEX O
that O
baked B-TARGET
garlic I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
is O
something O
wonderful. O

As O
we O
were O
told O
like O
this O
in O
the O
city O
no O
longer O
serve O
anywhere, O
this O
is O
the O
firm’s B-TARGET
chef’s I-TARGET
dish. I-TARGET

Also O
tried O
soup-purée B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
(wonderful) O
and O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
(very O
delicious). O

Separately, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
the O
service B-TARGET
- O
at O
the O
top O
level. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Maria. O

I O
recommend O
everyone O
to O
go O
and O
evaluate O
themselves. O

Very O
spacious O
and O
light, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
in O
my O
favorite O
style O
:) O

There O
are O
many O
places, B-TARGET
and O
the O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window O
is O
good. O

They O
were O
in O
the O
afternoon O
(the O
husband's O
office O
in O
BC O
Avenue), O
went O
to O
drink O
coffee, O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat, O
so O
decided O
to O
evaluate O
the O
kitchen O
in O
a O
different O
time. O

I O
only O
ate O
pumpkin B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
(liked O
it, O
and O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
were O
served O
to O
him O
very O
delicious), O
my O
husband O
drank O
coffee. O

I O
hope O
to O
try O
the O
beer B-TARGET
next O
time, O
they O
say O
it’s O
not O
bad. O

There O
are O
no O
complaints O
to O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
we O
were O
in O
the O
daytime, O
there O
was O
little O
people O
in O
the O
hall, O
so O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
it O
is O
with O
the O
service O
in O
the O
evening. O

We O
were O
served O
quickly O
:) O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
again! O

Recently O
decided O
to O
visit O
this O
institution B-TARGET
with O
family O
and O
friends O
and O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
restaurant O
there O
were O
no O
free O
seats, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
confused, O
but O
this O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
speed O
and O
attention O
of O
the O
service. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
here O
was O
not O
indifferent O
to O
the O
mood O
and O
impression O
of O
the O
visitors. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
pleased, O
the O
classic O
Italian B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
were O
surprisingly O
delicious O
and O
extremely O
authentic. O

Everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
generous. O

After O
reading O
the O
reviews O
here, O
I O
concluded O
that O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
working O
on O
mistakes, O
and O
the O
carpaccio B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
we O
received O
was O
decorated O
much O
better O
than O
in O
the O
review O
from O
March O
last O
year. O

We O
picked O
up O
the O
children’s B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
and O
next O
time O
we’ll O
probably O
take O
the O
kids O
too. O

It O
was O
a O
complete O
absence O
of O
tobacco O
smoke. O

In O
general O
for O
us O
this O
visit O
was O
a O
pleasant O
discovery O
that O
near O
the O
house O
there O
is O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
enjoy O
a O
delicious O
meal O
in O
a O
warm O
atmosphere B-TARGET
with O
the O
whole O
family. O

At O
least, O
now O
I O
know O
where O
near O
home O
you O
can O
get O
a O
great O
pizza, B-TARGET
not O
worse O
than O
in O
northern O
Italy O
exactly) O

There O
were O
two O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O

Beautiful O
interior B-TARGET
- O
sat O
by O
the O
window O
behind O
a O
table O
with O
sofas. O

Much O
more O
comfortable O
than O
on O
the O
first O
floor. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
were O
small, O
but O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
delicious))) O

The O
service B-TARGET
did O
not O
like O
- O
cooking O
(or O
bringing??) O
order O
very O
long, O
given O
that O
both O
times O
the O
restaurant O
was O
half O
empty... O

If O
it O
wasn’t, O
I O
could O
call O
Mojo B-TARGET
a O
nice O
place O
to O
spend O
the O
evening O
with O
friends. O

13 O
January O
2014. O

Celebrated O
a O
birthday! O

We O
were O
5 O
people O
and O
it O
was O
Monday! O

In O
the O
room O
there O
was O
a O
table O
3 O
with O
us, O
the O
service B-TARGET
- O
very O
much O
liked! O

Our O
waitress B-TARGET
throughout O
the O
evening O
approached O
very O
often, O
to O
find O
out O
if O
everything O
was O
well O
and O
if O
we O
did O
not O
want O
something! O

Kalanchoe B-TARGET
is O
super! O

We O
ordered O
snacks, B-TARGET
wings, I-TARGET
cheese B-TARGET
balls, I-TARGET
fruits B-TARGET
- O
all O
very O
much O
liked!!! O

Wear O
not O
long! O

We O
are O
pleased!! O

thank O
you! O

We O
will O
come O
back O
to O
you!! O

Maybe O
the O
staff O
or O
the O
management O
of O
restaurants O
are O
still O
reading O
reviews O
and O
being O
corrected... O
On O
this O
site O
lately O
I O
often O
read O
reviews, O
but O
when O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
April, O
I O
did O
not O
read O
anything O
about O
it. O

So O
I O
liked O
it O
all. O

We O
were O
with O
my O
husband O
on O
Monday O
around O
eight O
in O
the O
evening, O
a O
girl B-TARGET
met, O
spent O
at O
the O
table O
and O
brought O
the O
menu. O

Literally O
after O
5 O
minutes O
came O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
made O
the O
order, O
he O
brought O
spices O
and O
disassembled O
the O
utensils, O
drinks O
quickly O
appeared O
on O
the O
table. O

In O
the O
advertisement O
I O
saw O
that O
they O
have O
a O
children's B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
the O
waitress O
showed O
where O
it O
is, O
of O
course, O
small, O
but O
3-4 O
children O
there O
will O
find O
something O
to O
do, O
there O
is O
a O
TV, B-TARGET
a O
computer, B-TARGET
a O
board B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
puddles I-TARGET
and O
a O
table B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
drawing, I-TARGET
my O
son O
would O
like O
there. O

So O
the O
salads O
brought O
in O
20 O
minutes, O
I O
ordered O
with O
tuna, B-TARGET
very O
liked, O
husband O
Caesar B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
- O
without O
much O
enthusiasm, O
but O
without O
complaints. O

Hot, O
my O
- O
a O
steak B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
of O
good O
roasting, B-TARGET
very O
liked, O
my O
husband O
ordered O
a O
steak B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
marble I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
with O
something O
there, O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
dry, O
but O
spicy O
with O
sauce O
quite O
tolerable. O

The O
latte B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
was O
good. O

All O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
appetizing, O
the O
size O
of O
the O
portions B-TARGET
was O
decent. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
ashes O
were O
changed O
quickly, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
tactically O
helped O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
dessert. O

The O
account O
is O
3300. O

If O
necessary, O
we O
will O
go O
for O
a O
dessert O
with O
the O
child. O

I O
visited O
this O
pub O
for O
the O
first O
time O
recently O
and O
I O
can O
say O
that O
this O
is O
a O
very O
good O
place! B-TARGET

Very O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
- O
purely O
Pabovsky, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
unobtrusive O
and O
comfortable. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
necessary O
for O
fun O
and O
friendly O
communication. O

As O
for O
the O
service, B-TARGET
it O
is O
quite O
acceptable O
for O
Saturday O
evening. O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
offered O
one O
of O
the O
few O
free O
tables, O
then O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
the O
waitress O
brought O
the O
menu. O

Enjoyed O
a O
wide O
selection O
of O
beer, B-TARGET
other O
alcohol, B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
snacks B-TARGET
and O
various O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
every O
taste. O

I O
was O
surprised O
by O
such O
a O
large O
menu B-TARGET
in O
the O
pub! O

Although, O
it O
may O
even O
be O
too O
much...Our O
order O
we O
waited O
for O
20 O
minutes. O

Of O
the O
shortcomings O
can O
be O
noted O
the O
forgetfulness O
of O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
- O
a O
friend O
waited O
for O
their O
cigarettes O
only O
after O
the O
third O
request. O

But O
this O
can O
be O
compensated O
with O
very O
polite O
service. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
beer, B-TARGET
the O
most O
delicious. O

Cocktails B-TARGET
are O
at O
a O
very O
good O
level O
too. O

There O
are O
no O
complaints O
about O
granks B-TARGET
and O
steaks, B-TARGET
there O
are O
many O
spices B-TARGET
in O
Caesar. I-TARGET

But O
the O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
completely O
disappointed O
- O
it's O
not O
the O
Pabovsky O
dish O
anyway! O

At O
the O
end, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
bill, O
and O
then O
we O
waited O
15 O
minutes O
for O
the O
delivery. O

Overall, O
they O
sat O
well! O

I O
think O
we O
will O
come O
in O
more O
often. O

Prices, O
by O
the O
way, O
are O
also O
normal O
- O
average O
for O
such O
establishments, B-TARGET
not O
overpriced O
as O
many. O

I O
love O
Italian O
cuisine. O

I O
went O
with O
my O
friends O
several O
times, O
but O
they O
all O
failed. O

The O
food O
is O
cold O
and O
not O
delivered O
on O
time. O

First O
one O
girlfriend, O
then O
another, O
and O
I O
have O
another O
15 O
minutes O
later. O

In O
the O
end, O
the O
friends O
had O
to O
eat O
everything O
cold. O

I O
was O
then O
generally O
brought O
fresh O
pasta, B-TARGET
poured O
in O
oil O
and O
roasted O
with O
rubbed O
cheese. O

It O
doesn’t O
look O
like O
pasta!! B-TARGET

This O
is O
done O
by O
professionals!!! O

Although, O
before O
this O
occasion, O
the O
dishes O
were O
delicious, O
but O
again O
they O
did O
not O
endure O
on O
time O
or O
all O
at O
once O
(and O
salads, O
and O
hot, O
and O
pizza). O

We O
made O
a O
comment O
to B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
waitress, I-TARGET
and O
she O
looks O
at O
us, O
knocks O
in O
the O
eyes O
and O
asks, O
“What’s O
wrong?” O

You O
ask O
to O
warm O
up O
- O
made O
such O
an O
unhappy O
face O
that O
it O
is O
better O
to O
eat O
cold O
you O
will. O

The O
dishes O
are O
confused. O

They O
ordered O
one, O
brought O
another, O
and O
did O
not O
apologize. O

How O
many O
times O
have O
I O
been O
out, O
every O
time O
I O
have O
gone O
out O
with O
a O
damaged O
mood!!! O

In O
general, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
terrible, O
I O
will O
never O
go O
there O
again!!! O

In O
our O
area O
there O
are O
some O
places O
where O
you O
can O
relax O
well, O
have O
a O
good O
meal O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
time! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
twice. O

The O
first O
time O
one, O
went O
for O
lunch, O
immediately O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
sat O
on O
a O
convenient O
couch, B-TARGET
served O
quickly O
and O
without O
a O
complaint, O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
bill, O
for O
the O
institution B-TARGET
located O
in O
Nevsk O
very O
inexpensive. O

The O
second O
time O
I O
came O
with O
a O
girl, O
pre-ordered O
a O
table O
where O
I O
was O
sitting O
the O
first O
time, O
the B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
at O
a O
good O
level, O
a O
very O
good O
carpenter, B-TARGET
carpenter B-TARGET
was O
great. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time, O
the O
girl O
liked O
it. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
not O
the O
last O
time. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
appetite O
by O
chance. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
a O
daily O
day O
(Tuesday, O
September O
14) O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
they O
still O
decided O
to O
stay.we O
met O
the O
manager O
- O
a O
dark-haired O
slim O
girl, O
was O
at O
the O
table O
and O
gave O
the O
menu. O

Five O
minutes O
later, O
the O
waitress O
arrived, O
accepted O
the O
order O
and O
left. O

Looking O
around O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full, O
but O
we O
were O
mistaken, O
the O
waiting O
was O
not O
long O
- O
quite O
acceptable O
for O
any O
institution, O
after O
a O
pleasant O
conversation O
we O
did O
not O
notice O
how O
the O
time O
passed... O

Business B-TARGET
lunch, I-TARGET
surprisingly, O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
delicious O
and O
satisfying O
- O
quite O
in O
line O
with O
its O
price. O

In O
general, O
a O
very O
good O
place, B-TARGET
a O
variety O
of O
delicious O
menus, B-TARGET
reasonable O
prices O
and O
high O
quality O
of O
service! B-TARGET
we O
really O
liked O
everything. O
thanks O
to O
this O
institution! B-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
on O
the O
weekend. O

A O
wedding O
for O
30 O
people O
was O
celebrated O
in O
the O
"Dragon" O
restaurant O
on O
July O
1, O
2010. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
was O
chosen O
by O
chance, O
more O
by O
location, O
but O
did O
not O
regret O
it. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
was O
small, O
but O
there O
was O
enough O
space O
for O
our O
celebration, O
the O
veranda O
was O
also O
at O
our O
disposal. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
light O
and O
you O
feel O
comfortable O
in O
it. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good: O
delicious O
meat B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
snacks B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
finest O
fat O
conquered O
men, O
amazing O
salads. B-TARGET

Guests O
liked O
the B-TARGET
wine. I-TARGET

The O
first B-TARGET
meals I-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
are O
excellent O
(soup B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
smoked I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
caviar I-TARGET
tried O
on O
the O
next O
visit). O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
collective I-TARGET
deserves O
a O
separate O
mention. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
wary. O

Administrator B-TARGET
Svetlana O
helped O
us O
with O
the O
preparation O
of O
the O
banquet O
menu O
and O
took O
care O
of O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
of O
the O
hall, O
treated O
us O
with O
great O
attention. O

In O
general, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Dragó" O
leaves O
the O
most O
positive O
impression O
after O
the O
tour O
and O
after O
a O
family O
dinner. O

After O
ambiguous O
impressions O
about O
the O
Harbin O
restaurant O
in O
Primorsky, O
they O
decided O
to O
check O
their O
impressions O
about O
the O
first O
visit O
to O
the O
restaurant O
at O
the O
Academic. O

In O
the O
evening, O
around O
18:00 O
we O
went O
to O
the O
Harbin O
restaurant O
at O
the O
Academic. O

There O
were O
rooms O
for O
smokers O
and O
non-smokers. O

We O
chose O
a O
non-smoking B-TARGET
hall, I-TARGET
which, O
unlike O
Harbin O
in O
Primorsky, O
is O
located O
completely O
separately O
from O
smoking O
visitors. O

The B-TARGET
chairs I-TARGET
in O
the O
non-smoking O
room O
are O
European, O
very O
convenient, O
unlike O
the O
other O
room, B-TARGET
where O
they O
are O
made O
in O
Chinese O
style, O
but O
sitting O
on O
them O
is O
not O
convenient. O

The O
order O
was O
received O
quickly, O
and, O
what O
was O
our O
surprise, O
already O
in O
5 O
minutes O
brought O
the O
first O
dish. O

Within O
15 O
minutes, O
the O
entire O
order O
was O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
are O
very O
delicious, O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cooking, I-TARGET
to O
our O
taste, O
much O
better O
than O
in O
Harbin O
on O
Primorsky O
(to O
compare O
ordered O
several O
dishes, O
such O
as O
in O
another O
restaurant). O

Special O
talk O
about O
tea. O

The O
choice O
here O
is O
much O
better O
and O
richer. O

There O
could O
be O
more O
offers. O

It O
is O
pleasant O
that O
the O
tea B-TARGET
is O
not O
packaged O
unlike O
the O
restaurant O
in O
Primorsk. O

In O
the O
menu O
is O
good O
French B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
dry I-TARGET
wine. I-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
service, B-TARGET
fast O
and O
high-quality, O
timely O
cleaned O
the O
dishes O
released, O
and O
other O
little O
things, O
was O
pleasant. O

Without O
alcohol, O
the O
bill O
for O
two O
was O
1300 O
rubles. O

Recommend O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
visit. O

I O
want O
to O
share O
my O
impression O
of O
visiting O
the O
restaurant O
"Krapiva". O

The O
silver O
wedding O
was O
celebrated O
on O
27.08.2010. O

At O
the O
first O
meeting O
with O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
I O
liked O
it. O

Good O
interior, B-TARGET
nice, O
educated O
administrator B-TARGET
Svetlana. O

It O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
selecting O
the O
menu. O

When O
serving O
the O
banquet, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
looked O
closely O
at O
the O
table O
so O
that O
there O
were O
no O
empty O
plates, O
while O
not O
very O
obsessive. O

The O
guests O
were O
also O
very O
pleased. O

A O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
helped O
with O
the O
music O
at O
the O
bar O
stand, O
unfortunately O
I O
do O
not O
know O
all O
the O
names. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
domestic. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much, O
we O
will O
visit O
this O
lovely O
place B-TARGET
again O
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
our O
friends. O

Visiting O
the O
“Krapiva” B-TARGET
will O
remain O
for O
a O
lifetime!!! O

Very O
strange, O
ordering O
a O
table O
in O
the O
cafe, O
come, O
and O
there... O
no O
one. O

None O
of O
the O
visitors. O

As O
if O
it O
was O
not O
in O
the O
cafe, O
but O
guests, O
and O
only O
you O
were O
waiting O
there. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
house O
- O
yes, O
the O
atmosphere... O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
still O
created O
by O
visitors, O
there O
was O
little O
noise, O
voices, O
faces... O

Overall, O
the O
coffee B-TARGET
left O
a O
very O
good O
impression. O

Small, O
cozy, O
cakes O
from O
their O
own B-TARGET
delicious I-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
color O
the O
waiting O
for O
dishes. O

There O
is O
no O
beer, B-TARGET
but O
it O
seems O
like O
it O
should O
be O
in O
this O
format. O

The O
mind O
is O
looking O
for O
shortcomings O
and O
shortcomings, O
and O
they O
are O
there. O

But O
the O
impression O
is O
formed O
on O
the O
emotions O
- O
they O
remained O
from O
the O
visit O
only O
positive! O

I O
went O
in O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
child. O

Background O
music O
– O
Radio O
Hermitage. O

The O
weather O
was O
hot, O
sitting O
in O
the O
second O
room, O
it O
was O
cooler. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
disappointing, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
cause O
any O
special O
enthusiasm. O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
decent. O

The O
girl O
was O
a O
waitress O
and O
a O
cashier O
in O
one O
person, O
most O
of O
the O
time O
was O
in O
the O
first O
room, O
and O
not O
always O
controlled O
when O
to O
remove O
plates O
or O
react O
to O
new O
wishes. O

Give O
a O
neighbor’s O
card O
with O
a O
discount O
of O
15%, O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

We O
come O
again. O

Hi O
to! O

Visited O
your O
institution O
yesterday O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
passing O
by O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
enter, O
before O
this O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
had O
dinner O
with O
the O
family O
in O
Nevsk, O
were O
not O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
service. O

I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
visiting O
your O
institution B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
marathon O
changed O
my O
attitude O
for O
the O
better. O

We O
came O
to O
you O
in O
the O
evening, O
tired, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
all O
the O
halls B-TARGET
were O
crowded O
and O
on O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
it O
was O
still O
cool O
to O
sit O
with O
the O
child, O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
met O
us O
and O
offered O
several O
tables O
where O
we O
could O
sit, O
a O
girl B-TARGET
already O
led O
us O
to O
the O
table O
(unfortunately O
I O
did O
not O
remember O
the O
name) O
judging O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
administrator, B-TARGET
she O
also O
provided O
the O
menu, O
which O
most O
surprised O
us O
poured O
absolutely O
free O
water O
on O
the O
glasses, O
it O
was O
very O
pleasant. O

At O
Nevsky O
Prospectus, O
during O
my O
2 O
visits, O
I O
didn’t O
even O
know O
that O
you O
had O
such O
a O
plan. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
non-obsessive, O
feel O
like O
at O
home. O

We O
usually O
like O
to O
eat O
somewhere O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
even O
a O
little O
surprised O
that O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
helps O
in O
the O
choice, O
usually O
where O
the O
shadows O
are O
flashing O
in O
the O
hall O
near O
the O
box O
office, O
which O
is O
bragging O
the O
waiters. O

A O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
brought O
us O
an O
order, O
literally O
in O
20 O
minutes O
hotter.and O
also O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
began. O

In O
the O
evening O
we O
went O
to O
Hurricane. O

A O
special O
thanks O
to O
the O
girl B-TARGET
for O
the O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the B-TARGET
young I-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
such O
employees B-TARGET
and O
want O
to O
see O
in O
the O
institutions O
of O
St. O
Petersburg. O

I O
hope O
to O
visit O
you O
again O
several O
times. O

I O
once O
saw O
that O
a O
new O
restaurant O
opened O
in O
the O
place O
of O
a O
not-known O
store. O

The O
view O
from O
the O
window O
of O
Nevsky O
made O
me O
look O
in O
there. O

And O
the O
interior B-TARGET
did O
not O
disappoint O
me, O
but, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
was O
very O
pleased. O

Very O
nice O
and O
cozy O
place. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

Our O
waitress B-TARGET
had O
a O
lot O
to O
explain O
to O
us, O
as O
I O
wasn’t O
familiar O
with O
such O
Asian O
cuisine. O

But O
he O
suggested O
a O
lot, O
described, O
helped O
choose. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
this O
choice. O

I O
took O
coconut O
soup O
with O
seafood. O

It O
was O
sharp, O
but, O
as O
I O
understood, O
it O
was O
the O
peculiarity O
of O
the O
kitchen. O

But O
I O
like O
the O
spicy O
and O
I O
was O
delighted O
with O
the O
food. B-TARGET

A O
friend O
ordered O
a O
salad O
with O
oranges, O
rucola O
and O
salmon, O
and O
for O
dessert O
we O
took O
mango O
mousse O
and O
lemon O
dessert. O

We O
liked O
everything O
very O
much. O

It O
was O
crazy O
delicious!! O

I O
recommend O
everyone O
to O
visit O
this O
place!!! B-TARGET

On O
April O
27, O
I O
walked O
with O
my O
wife O
to O
Pushkin O
and O
accidentally O
went O
out O
to O
eat. O

We O
ordered O
pork, O
vegetables O
on O
the O
grill, O
potatoes O
"Aidacho" O
on O
home O
morse O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
French O
white O
dry O
wine. O

What O
I O
liked. O

Very O
delicious, O
large O
shale B-TARGET
on O
a O
shampoo O
with O
an O
original O
support. O

When O
it O
is O
introduced, O
it O
burns. O

The O
vegetables B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill O
and O
Idaho B-TARGET
are O
also O
very O
good. O

In O
a O
word, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
great. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
did O
not O
impress O
me. O

Due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
walls B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
glass I-TARGET
packages I-TARGET
feel O
like O
you O
are O
in O
a O
greenhouse. O

But O
there O
is O
something O
in O
that O
too. O

I O
liked O
the O
service, B-TARGET
but O
there O
was O
one O
thing O
but: O
When O
ordered, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
offered O
to O
take O
a O
morse O
of O
500 O
ml, O
and O
brought O
high O
thin O
glasses O
of O
200 O
ml. O

I O
did O
not O
immediately O
pay O
attention. O

When O
she O
told O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
about O
it, O
she O
was O
very O
upset. O

I O
think O
– O
I O
don’t O
pay O
attention O
to O
this, O
in O
the O
account O
would O
be O
the O
amount O
for O
two O
to O
500 O
million, O
not O
for O
two O
to O
200 O
million. O

But O
these O
are O
only O
my O
guesses. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
girl O
and O
a O
young O
man. O

Quickly, O
polite O
and O
carefully. O

I O
didn’t O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
long O
time O
to O
order. O

Remove O
used O
clothes O
quickly. O

All O
kindly O
and O
with O
a O
smile. O

The O
bill O
came O
for O
2050 O
rubles. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
not O
a O
bad O
establishment. B-TARGET

I O
recommend. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
with O
a O
friend O
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
the O
parents, O
they O
were O
recently O
very O
liked! O

And O
us O
too! O

Very O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
we O
sat O
in O
the O
first O
hall, O
curtains B-TARGET
were O
just O
super, O
and O
there O
were O
a O
couple O
of O
paintings B-TARGET
that O
I O
would O
very O
much O
like O
to O
have O
at O
home) O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
good, O
they O
are O
cooked O
quickly O
enough, O
I O
took O
a O
soda B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
rice, I-TARGET
it O
was O
very O
delicious O
and O
amazing O
coffee B-TARGET
Borgia, I-TARGET
I O
haven't O
tried O
it O
before!! O

A O
friend O
took O
one O
of O
the O
eastern B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
unfortunately O
I O
cannot O
reproduce O
the O
exact O
name, O
but O
I O
was O
also O
satisfied! O

America B-TARGET
has O
not O
disappointed O
her O
either. O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
were O
on O
Friday O
evening O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
somewhat O
hindered, O
the O
girl O
and O
the O
young O
man O
who O
were O
there O
were O
more O
engaged O
in O
their O
business! O

More O
complaints O
to O
this O
place O
in O
principle O
did O
not O
arise.) O

General O
conclusion: O
cozy O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
center, B-TARGET
with O
reasonable O
prices O
and O
very O
comfortable O
environment B-TARGET

A O
very O
friendly O
and O
warm O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
created O
for O
us O
at O
the O
restaurant O
Prospect. O

We O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
a O
meeting O
of O
friends O
here. O

In O
the O
St. O
Petersburg O
style, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
isined, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
everything O
is O
very O
delicious, O
the B-TARGET
table I-TARGET
and O
individual O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
magnificent. O

The O
prices O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

Everyone O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
evening. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
restaurant O
staff. B-TARGET

Being O
with O
a O
friend, O
big O
fans O
of O
Italian O
cuisine, O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
visit O
this O
place. O

It O
was O
a O
waking O
day, O
a O
tortured O
girl B-TARGET
met O
us O
at O
the O
entrance, O
saying O
that O
there O
were O
no O
places... O
looking O
around O
and O
indeed O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
occupied. O

We O
decided O
not O
to O
give O
up O
and O
offered O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
to O
be O
released. O

She O
immediately O
said O
that O
there O
were O
tables O
below, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
light O
there O
yet... O
During O
this O
conversation, O
the O
light O
below O
was O
turned O
on O
and O
we O
were O
led O
down. O

We O
sat O
at O
a O
table O
for O
two, O
there O
was O
a O
noisy O
company O
next O
to O
it, O
and O
overall O
it O
was O
very O
noisy. O

Menu...a B-TARGET
few O
laminous O
leaves: O
a O
lot O
of O
pasta, B-TARGET
pizza, B-TARGET
and O
a O
few O
salads B-TARGET
and O
snacks. B-TARGET

A O
person O
who O
is O
not O
familiar O
with O
Italian O
cuisine O
will O
find O
it O
very O
difficult O
to O
understand. O

Very O
small O
choice O
of O
wine. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
came O
quickly O
and O
accepted O
the O
order. O

Drinks O
were O
also O
served O
quickly. O

Cappuccino B-TARGET
coffee, O
in O
a O
large O
cup, O
is O
very O
good, O
champagne B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
didn’t O
like O
it. O

Compared O
to O
other O
Italian O
restaurants O
where O
we O
ate O
(groups, O
itali O
groups) O
is O
not O
at O
all O
comparable. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
price O
corresponds O
to O
the O
quality. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant, O
but O
a O
cafe. O

The O
impression O
is O
generally O
quite O
pleasant. O

Good O
morning O
to O
everyone! O

In O
the O
restaurant O
Miso O
in O
Moscow O
we O
go O
with O
colleagues O
to O
lunch O
almost O
every O
day, O
usually O
the O
company O
of O
5-6 O
people, O
before O
this O
incident O
we O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
beautiful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
but O
in O
our O
next O
lunch B-TARGET
was O
added O
human O
hair!!!!!! O

Black O
and O
dense, O
beautifully O
wrapped O
on O
a O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
that O
got O
into O
my O
mouth. O

The O
good O
mood O
went O
away O
with O
the O
appetite. O

Of O
course O
I O
was O
offered O
to O
replace O
the O
dish, B-TARGET
but O
the O
desire O
to O
eat O
was O
no O
more! O

I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
I O
or O
my O
colleagues O
will O
soon O
have O
the O
desire O
to O
visit O
this O
institution. B-TARGET

Last O
time O
I O
was O
at O
this O
restaurant O
a O
few O
years O
ago. O

Then O
I O
liked O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
large O
portions B-TARGET
+ O
humane O
prices. O

We O
sat O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
outstanding, O
but O
not O
obsessive. O

The O
impression O
remains O
positive. O

Recently O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
with O
a O
small O
company O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
here O
and O
refresh O
memories. O

As O
before, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
prices O
are O
decent. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
large O
and O
can O
be O
selected O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

Sitting O
on O
the O
first O
floor. O

Interesting O
interior B-TARGET
- O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
it O
before. O

Guests O
and O
I O
generally O
liked O
it. O

Rested O
with O
friends, O
walked, O
celebrated O
a O
friend's O
birthday, O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
Tres O
Amigos, O
we O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
very O
cozy O
and O
breathing O
with O
the O
home O
atmosphere! O

Since O
we O
all O
do O
not O
smoke, O
we O
were O
guided O
by O
friendly O
and O
smiling O
waiters B-TARGET
to O
the O
non-smoking O
hall, O
the O
hall B-TARGET
was O
spacious O
and O
bright, O
quite O
cozy! O

I O
would O
like O
to O
note O
the O
work O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
: O
all O
very O
kind O
and O
smiling O
guys, O
Olya O
our O
waitress B-TARGET
leading O
us O
to O
the O
table, O
immediately O
offered O
us O
drinks, O
offered O
her O
help O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
dishes, O
all O
told O
in O
detail O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
struggle O
for O
a O
long O
time O
reading O
the O
menu! O

Drinks O
were O
brought O
immediately, O
food O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
long, O
everything O
was O
very O
fast O
and O
prompt, O
although O
there O
were O
not O
many O
guests O
in O
the O
restaurant O
at O
the O
time! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
great!!! O

We O
felt O
at O
home O
all O
night!! O

This O
restaurant O
all O
and O
the O
flaming O
dances B-TARGET
(which O
were O
in O
the O
evening) O
and O
the O
service, B-TARGET
and O
the O
food, B-TARGET
and O
very O
delicious O
cocktails!! B-TARGET

So O
we O
opened O
up O
for O
ourselves O
a O
new O
institution B-TARGET
that O
we O
will O
now O
go O
all O
the O
time, O
where O
everyone O
smiles O
to O
you O
and O
where O
you O
are O
happy O
to O
see))))) O

Three B-TARGET
Amigos I-TARGET
are O
the O
best!! O

So O
keep))))))))))))))))))) O

This O
institution B-TARGET
was O
visited O
for O
the O
first O
time O
by O
chance, O
after O
which O
they O
became O
quite O
frequent O
guests, O
it O
is O
pleasant O
to O
see O
already O
familiar O
faces O
among O
staff, B-TARGET
because O
unfortunately, O
one O
time O
it O
changed O
very O
often. O

Monday O
came O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised: O
songs B-TARGET
FREE!)) O

You O
will O
find O
any O
composition. O

As O
for O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
they O
are O
cooked O
quite O
quickly O
and O
deliciously, O
of O
all O
I O
would O
like O
to O
note O
steaks B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
salmon! I-TARGET

The O
only O
moment O
- O
came O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
on O
Thursday O
did O
not O
work O
the O
Japanese O
cuisine O
(and O
rolls O
we O
also O
love O
very O
much!). O

Special O
thanks O
for O
the O
service B-TARGET
lovely O
Tatiana, O
very O
often O
we O
get O
on O
her, O
and O
we O
always O
get O
friendly O
and O
quality O
service, B-TARGET
will O
always O
advise O
and O
respond O
to O
the O
joke, O
you O
can O
see O
that O
the O
girl B-TARGET
with O
a O
sense O
of O
humor). O

Thanks O
to O
you! O

Hi O
to. O

I O
write O
about O
restaurants O
reviews O
not O
often O
and O
only O
bad, O
a O
good O
impression O
I O
note O
with O
tea O
and O
thanks O
directly O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

So O
here. O

We O
went O
there O
with O
a O
company O
of O
7 O
people, O
two O
of O
whom O
were O
children. O

It O
was O
occupied O
somewhere O
20% O
of O
the O
tables, O
but O
on O
the O
request O
to O
bring O
another O
menu, O
they O
replied O
that O
there O
were O
no O
free O
tables(((( O
someone O
clearly O
read O
two O
at O
once?) O

We O
took O
advantage O
of O
their O
offer O
for O
pasta B-TARGET
and O
sushi. B-TARGET

The O
pasta B-TARGET
represented O
swollen O
pasta B-TARGET
with O
an O
incomprehensible O
sauce, B-TARGET
and O
sushi... O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
they O
were O
cooked O
for O
exactly O
1 O
hour O
and O
20 O
minutes O
(this O
is O
how O
I O
already O
wrote O
at O
a O
actually O
empty O
restaurant). O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
explained O
the O
delay O
to O
the O
large O
volume O
of O
orders, O
and O
after O
comments O
in O
general O
stopped O
approaching O
us. O

Several O
times O
asked O
hot B-TARGET
towels I-TARGET
were O
never O
brought. O

I O
also O
did O
not O
receive O
a O
complaint O
book O
(per O
there O
are O
no O
free O
papers O
in O
it). O

Everything O
could O
be O
good: O
the O
location, B-TARGET
the O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
the O
organization B-TARGET
of O
the O
work O
is O
awful, O
it’s O
just O
unclear O
who O
is O
doing O
it. O

And O
do O
not O
organize O
any O
promotions O
if O
you O
have O
one O
cook B-TARGET
and O
he O
is O
not O
able O
to O
serve O
up O
to O
4 O
tables O
at O
once! O

And O
the O
girl B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
seeing O
that O
we O
have O
children, O
could O
warn O
that O
the O
average O
waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
for I-TARGET
food O
is O
1-1,5 O
hours!!!!!!! O

I O
think O
that O
will O
hit O
the O
fate O
of O
its O
predecessors. O

My O
friends O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
pub O
No. O
1 O
on O
Friday O
night. O

I O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
him, O
but O
never O
was, O
and O
then O
the O
case O
turned... O
We O
took O
the O
table, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
came O
literally O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes. O

As O
for O
the O
menu, O
there O
is O
a O
large O
beer B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
in O
the O
pub. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
I O
did O
not O
find O
it O
quite O
appropriate O
to O
have O
a O
sushi B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
in O
the O
pub. O

Tired O
of O
institutions O
that O
mix O
all O
the O
formats O
in O
a O
row. O

If O
it O
was O
a O
pub, B-TARGET
then O
let O
it O
remain O
a O
pub... O
But O
at O
my O
own O
risk O
and O
risk, O
I O
didn’t O
resist O
the O
temptation O
and O
ordered O
my O
favorite O
sushi, O
although O
many O
times O
I O
got O
rid O
of O
it... O
If O
you O
don’t O
care O
especially, O
then O
the O
sushi, B-TARGET
in O
general, O
was O
ordinary, O
but... O
like O
a O
little O
bit O
underdrawn O
to O
the O
level O
so O
that O
you O
could O
really O
enjoy O
them. O

The O
friends O
also O
ordered O
a O
pasta B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
foam I-TARGET
and O
steak B-TARGET
- O
they O
liked O
both O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
brought O
and O
the O
size O
of O
the O
portions. B-TARGET

Everyone O
liked O
beer B-TARGET
too, O
and O
the O
choice O
was O
quite O
large O
- O
as O
it O
should O
be O
in O
the O
pub. O

We O
were O
served O
quite O
quickly, O
there O
are O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
interior B-TARGET
either. O

Conclusion: O
to O
come O
to O
the O
pub B-TARGET
is O
worth O
it, O
but O
especially O
selected O
to O
the O
Japanese O
cuisine O
to O
order O
sushi O
is O
better O
in O
specially O
dedicated O
places. O

I O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
girl. O

Very O
liked O
it. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
great, O
all O
of O
wood O
and O
very O
beautiful! O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
attentive O
and O
non-obsessive. O

Playing O
pleasant O
music! B-TARGET

As O
for O
the O
kitchen: O
I O
was O
delighted O
with O
the O
warm B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
beef, I-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
the O
beef B-TARGET
steak! I-TARGET

I O
can't O
even O
mention O
cream B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
salmon! I-TARGET

The O
guys O
are O
just O
nice O
- O
very O
delicious! O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
“worthy.” O

In O
general, O
we O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
such O
a O
wonderful O
place, B-TARGET
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
again, O
and O
not O
once! O

He O
was O
in O
the O
hospital O
with O
his O
girlfriend O
on O
Friday. O

Not O
very O
bad. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
still O
has O
a O
lot O
to O
work O
on, O
of O
course, O
but O
nevertheless, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
nice, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
delicious. O

They O
ordered O
salads O
and O
hot O
(sticks O
from O
salmon O
and O
a O
dish O
called O
"saturated O
havrony" O
from O
pork). O

brought O
quickly. O

Strong O
alcohol, B-TARGET
other O
than O
beer, O
they O
do O
not O
yet O
have, O
apparently O
with O
the O
license O
problem, O
but O
the O
honeymoon B-TARGET
proved O
very O
even O
pleasant. O

I O
would O
like, O
of O
course, O
more O
variation O
in O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
but O
since O
they O
have O
recently O
opened, O
I O
think O
over O
time O
everything O
will O
be O
fine O
with O
them. O

To O
meet O
with O
friends, O
this O
institution O
was O
chosen O
mainly O
due O
to O
reviews. O

Well, O
first, O
I O
want O
to O
point O
out O
one O
small O
disappointment O
that O
captured O
me O
immediately: O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

I O
really O
expected O
to O
see O
something O
more. O

I O
will O
not O
be O
bored O
to O
write O
what O
is O
wrong. O

It O
just O
remained O
the O
feeling O
that O
such O
an O
interesting O
idea O
gangster B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
could O
not O
fully O
realize. O

Black O
and O
white O
posters, O
brick O
walls. O

Second: O
The O
meeting B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
guests I-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
was O
absent, O
we O
stood O
waiting...looking O
around, O
a O
couple O
of O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
doing O
their O
business... O

Without O
waiting O
for O
at O
least O
some O
attention O
to O
our O
address, O
we O
approached O
the O
nearest O
waitress B-TARGET
and O
asked O
to O
sit O
us O
at O
the O
table O
ordered O
earlier. O

have O
passed. O

They O
sat. O

Further O
was O
better. O

The O
order O
was O
received O
quickly, O
the O
food O
was O
brought O
too O
quickly, O
cleaned O
empty O
plates, O
glasses O
in O
time. O

The O
food B-TARGET
itself O
corresponds O
to O
the O
selected O
style O
of O
the O
institution. B-TARGET

In O
fact, O
nothing O
special O
is O
offered. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
smiling, O
friendly. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired O
for O
cheese O
lovers, O
but O
it's O
just O
very O
little O
:) O

Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
- O
a O
plate O
of O
cabbage, O
and O
three O
thin O
(0,3 O
cm) O
piece O
of O
chicken, B-TARGET
cakes, O
sauce. O

There O
were O
no O
more O
complaints O
from O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

In O
the O
end, O
I O
want O
to O
conclude: O
the O
price-quality O
ratio O
isined. O

Great O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
big O
company. O

Restaurant B-TARGET
is O
interesting. O

We O
have O
been O
there O
quite O
often O
and O
never O
left O
disappointed. O

The O
interior O
is O
divided O
into O
3 O
floors O
on O
each. O

I O
do O
not O
like O
the O
first. O

For O
some O
reason O
does O
not O
leave O
the O
feeling O
of O
a O
dining B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
(although O
in O
fact O
it O
is O
not) O

The O
chairs B-TARGET
are O
not O
comfortable. O

Lots O
of O
tables B-TARGET
in O
the O
center. O

No O
feeling O
of O
comfort. O

The O
third, O
as O
I O
understand, O
mostly O
for O
banquets... O
also O
nothing O
special. O

The O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
is O
very O
comfortable. O

The O
sofas... O

Shut O
down O
the O
light, B-TARGET
and O
all O
that. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
quite O
varied. O

I O
like O
Caesar B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
(very O
fresh, O
crisp O
and O
most O
importantly O
with O
very O
little B-TARGET
salted I-TARGET
fish) I-TARGET

Beef O
in O
Dionysus. O

Bring O
directly O
on O
a O
bowl O
baked O
under O
cheese B-TARGET
and O
tomatoes. B-TARGET

Very O
delicious. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
great!! O

Frozen B-TARGET
Parfums I-TARGET
is O
awesome! O

Service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Sometimes, O
of O
course, O
something O
is O
“cuts”... O
but O
in O
this O
case O
they O
bring O
some O
compliment. B-TARGET
(so O
was O
twice) O

Prices O
are O
slightly O
above O
average. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
best O
suited O
for O
both O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
and O
a O
birthday O
celebration. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
there O
again. O

I O
read O
reviews O
about O
this O
restaurant O
and O
still O
decided O
to O
visit O
it. O

I O
expected O
a O
quiet O
horror, O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
the O
contrary, O
now O
I O
will O
not O
trust O
the O
reviews, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
check O
myself. O

I O
went O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
Thursday O
afternoon O
and O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch. O

We O
were O
met O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
who O
took O
us O
to O
the O
non-smoking O
hall, O
the O
people O
were, O
let's O
say, O
not O
a O
little, O
after O
reading O
the O
reviews O
expected O
that O
I O
would O
sit O
in O
the O
empty O
hall, O
but O
no, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
tables O
at O
the O
passage, O
we O
sat O
there. O

I O
ordered O
a O
salad, B-TARGET
a O
large O
portion, O
strangely O
it O
was O
brought O
in O
large O
quantities, O
ordered O
a O
hot O
beef O
steak, B-TARGET
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
soft O
and O
juicy, O
and O
of O
course O
my O
favorite O
is O
dessert, O
ordered O
tiramisu, B-TARGET
and O
made O
it O
right, O
very O
delicious O
dessert. B-TARGET

I O
will O
always O
have O
them O
now. O

I O
liked O
the O
service, B-TARGET
all O
brought O
quickly O
enough, O
the O
used O
plates O
were O
not O
delayed O
on O
the O
table, O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
served O
all O
promptly, O
I O
specifically O
monitored O
them O
))), O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
compare O
reviews O
with O
reality, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
reviews O
were O
wrong, O
although O
I O
may O
be O
just O
lucky, O
and O
yet O
I O
will O
go O
there O
again. O

And O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
I O
liked O
it, O
quiet O
unforced, O
everything O
clean O
and O
clean, O
without O
pathos. O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
2009, O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
in O
this O
restaurant O
twice. O

What O
there O
are O
no O
complaints O
about O
is O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
the O
interior B-TARGET
and O
the O
beer. B-TARGET

Very O
cozy O
(do O
not O
forget O
- O
this O
is O
a O
beer O
restaurant O
with O
the O
inherent O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
such O
an O
establishment). O

There O
is O
a O
rich O
menu B-TARGET
to O
choose O
from. O

Food B-TARGET
for O
every O
taste. O

Excellent O
dark B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
(lighter O
I O
did O
not O
try, O
more O
respected O
dark). O

Somewhere O
came O
in O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
commentary O
about O
the O
rude O
and O
rude O
waitresses O
- O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case. O

Both O
were O
very O
polite O
and O
were O
very O
pleased. O

Maybe O
a O
little O
longer O
than O
we O
would O
like, O
but O
first, O
it O
all O
depends O
not O
only O
on O
the O
waitresses, O
but O
also O
on O
the O
chefs, O
and O
secondly, O
the O
long O
wait O
was O
compensated O
by O
politeness O
and O
attention. O

It’s O
just O
about O
the O
chefs. O

Both O
times O
they O
ordered O
almost O
the O
same O
thing, O
but O
if O
the O
first O
time O
everything O
was O
crazyly O
delicious, O
then O
in O
the O
second O
time O
there O
was O
the O
impression O
that O
students O
are O
cooking. O

Probably O
another O
change. O

I O
can’t O
say O
that O
the O
second O
time O
was O
unhealthy. O

is O
normal. O

But O
not O
more. O

The O
first O
time O
in O
the O
face. O

The O
appearance O
of O
the O
dish. O

Per O
this O
second O
change O
hurt O
that O
day? O
:) O

In O
May, O
I O
and O
my O
friends O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Peter O
and O
we O
will O
definitely O
go O
to O
Hussynya. B-TARGET

Hopefully O
there O
will O
be O
a O
“first” O
change. O

I O
read O
the O
latest O
reviews O
and O
was O
very O
surprised. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
I’ve O
been O
a O
regular O
visitor O
to O
Tokyo B-TARGET
for O
several O
years, O
and O
I O
believe O
that O
in O
our O
area O
it’s O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places B-TARGET
to O
go. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
special O
complaints O
about O
them. O

Very O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
(and O
most O
importantly O
fresh O
fish!), B-TARGET
and O
quite O
inexpensive, O
there O
is O
a O
possibility O
to O
diversify O
the O
Japanese B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
European B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

Perfect O
staff B-TARGET
and O
pleasant O
interior. B-TARGET

The O
only O
downside O
- O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
order, O
and O
you O
can O
not O
find O
a O
free O
table, O
but O
we O
have O
recently O
always O
ordered O
a O
table O
by O
phone, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
tab. O

Tokyo, B-TARGET
we O
are O
with O
you! O
p.s. O
there O
is O
always O
crowded, O
I O
think O
it's O
an O
indicator O
that O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
enjoying O
good. O
so O
many O
people O
can't O
be O
mistaken O

A O
warm O
and O
comfortable O
home! O

Friendly O
and O
responsive O
staff, B-TARGET
very O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

Food, B-TARGET
it O
is O
worth O
saying O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
surprise O
a O
person O
who O
is O
accustomed O
and O
knows O
Georgian O
cuisine. O

I O
can O
say O
one O
thing, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised! O

Thanks O
to O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
he O
manages O
to O
create O
the O
feeling O
that O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
special O
place B-TARGET
where O
everyone O
feels O
like O
a O
long-awaited O
guest!))))))))))) O

I O
love O
this O
place B-TARGET
very O
much, O
I O
go O
there O
every O
week O
and O
I O
think O
I O
will O
visit O
it O
as O
often, O
because O
for O
me O
it O
is O
perfect O
in O
all O
respects. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
calm O
and O
comfortable, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
exactly O
what O
you O
need, O
especially O
does O
not O
attract O
attention, O
but O
in O
general O
is O
pleasant O
and O
hateful, O
very O
relaxing, O
and O
music B-TARGET
contributes O
to O
this. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
very O
cute, O
maybe O
because O
all O
the O
familiar O
faces, O
I O
don't O
know, O
so O
there O
is O
an O
unobjective O
assessment O
possible) O
but O
this O
impression O
was O
in O
the O
first O
visit. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
something. O

Everything O
I O
have O
tried O
in O
this O
place O
is O
wonderful! O

Absolutely O
everything! O

Pasta B-TARGET
- O
especially, O
just O
a O
miracle, O
I O
think O
everyone O
should O
try O
it. O

From O
the O
desserts O
it O
is O
worth O
trying O
a O
warm O
chocolate B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vanilla I-TARGET
ice O
cream O
- O
very... O

Who O
has O
not O
been O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
I O
think O
it O
is O
worth O
visiting, O
and O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
a O
panoramic B-TARGET
view, I-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
delicious O
cuisine, B-TARGET
and O
just O
to O
dive O
into O
the O
relaxing O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
7th O
sky. O

I O
celebrated O
my O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant O
this O
weekend. O

The O
table O
ordered O
in O
advance, O
asked O
to O
plant O
more O
comfortable-not O
disappointed, O
placed O
exactly O
where O
they O
wanted. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
playing O
calm O
music. B-TARGET

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
very O
liked, O
especially O
meat B-TARGET
(beef B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cabbage) I-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
(pear B-TARGET
Napoleon). I-TARGET

All O
the O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased, O
thank O
you O
very O
much!!! O

With O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
lucky, O
met O
a O
cute O
girl B-TARGET
who O
told O
in O
detail O
and O
answered O
all O
questions O
with O
a O
smile. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come! O

I O
went O
to O
this O
place O
after O
work O
for O
dinner. O

A O
friend B-TARGET
asked O
if O
a O
table O
was O
booked. O

I O
did O
not O
book O
a O
table O
in O
advance, O
so O
I O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
and O
offered O
to O
sit O
down O
the O
stairs. O

Therefore, O
I O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
there O
should O
be O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance O
in O
a O
more O
convenient O
place. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
friendly, O
constantly O
looking O
at O
the O
visitors, O
so O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
long, O
which O
is O
very O
pleasant. O

The O
menu O
is O
quite O
interesting, O
more O
oriented O
to O
the O
east, O
but O
the O
main O
thing O
in O
terms O
of O
prices O
is O
very O
democratic. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
tried O
a O
fried B-TARGET
eight-foot, I-TARGET
of O
course O
compared O
to O
nothing, O
but O
I O
liked O
it))) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
nice, O
little O
lighting, O
but O
candles B-TARGET
are O
put O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
walls O
create O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
wine O
cellar. O

I O
think O
if O
the O
task O
is O
to O
find O
a O
cozy, O
inexpensive O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
Moscow O
metro O
area, O
then O
this O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
best O
options. O

I O
think O
I O
will O
definitely O
go O
there O
again! O

We O
were O
on O
Friday O
(19.03.10), O
ordered O
a O
table O
for O
parental O
holiday O
on O
Sunday, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
and O
tried O
a O
little O
kitchen O
ourselves. O

They O
took O
azerbajdzhan O
shishlik O
(from O
lamb), O
Imerichen O
hachipuri, O
bayram O
salad O
and O
vegetables O
on O
the O
grill. O

Hachipuri B-TARGET
pumped O
a O
little, O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
little O
cheese, B-TARGET
although O
probably O
for O
an O
amateur. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
is O
juicy O
and O
delicious, O
lamb B-TARGET
and O
vegetables B-TARGET
are O
very O
worthy. O

The O
service B-TARGET
makes O
a O
pleasant O
impression. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
is O
not O
obsessive O
but O
polite...a O
very O
good O
combination. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
unfortunately O
not O
appreciated O
at O
the O
level, O
but O
not O
more, O
although O
it O
may O
be O
for O
a O
pleasant O
lunch B-TARGET
more O
and O
not O
need. O

The O
parents O
were O
very O
pleased. O

I O
especially O
want O
to O
express O
my O
thanks O
to O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
who O
worked O
these O
days O
(unfortunately O
I O
did O
not O
remember O
the O
name O
of O
the O
girl). O

I O
really O
wanted O
the O
parents O
to O
like O
it, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
above O
all O
praise. O

We O
were O
on O
March O
8, O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

I O
used O
to O
go O
to O
the O
pub O
before O
I O
was O
disappointed O
:( O

Everything O
is O
wasted! O

The O
waiters O
work O
terribly, O
you O
can't O
find O
out, O
everything O
needs O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time, O
what O
was O
brought O
from O
food O
- O
like O
in O
the O
dining O
room, O
something O
cooled, O
something O
unpleasant. O

In O
general, O
there O
is O
no O
more O
foot O
there. O
March O
8 O
was O
with O
friends O
and O
they O
offered O
to O
go O
to O
"billhook" O
in O
Kupčino. O

I O
would O
say O
again O
that O
I O
was O
surprised O
(in O
a O
good O
sense). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
similar O
to O
the O
first O
pub, O
quite O
cozy: O
sofas, B-TARGET
fireplace. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
he O
served O
so O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
afterwards))) O

With O
jokes, O
with O
a O
good O
mood, O
fast, O
delicious O
and O
quality. O

We O
all O
liked O
it O
and O
will O
be O
our O
regular O
guests!!! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
such O
a O
great O
establishment! B-TARGET

What O
I O
can O
say O
is: O
"BAD, O
VERY O
BAD O
RESTAURANT!!!!" O
I O
read O
the O
reviews, O
I O
probably O
live O
on O
another O
planet, O
ALL O
written O
lies!!! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
what O
leaves O
desires O
the O
best...!!!!! O
I O
haven’t O
seen O
this O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

Okay, O
the O
first O
hall B-TARGET
is O
passing, O
but O
there O
are O
tables, O
I O
hope O
they O
are O
always O
empty...like O
a O
store O
where O
there O
are O
refrigerators O
with O
ice O
cream! O

The O
other O
two O
rooms B-TARGET
are O
normal, O
of O
course O
to O
good) O
they O
polzti O
and O
polzti..., O
but O
here O
is O
the O
food!!!!! B-TARGET

I O
ordered O
baked B-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
(in O
sweet O
sauce)...I O
have O
something O
to O
compare O
with..... O
I O
tried O
it O
and O
was O
very O
upset(((( O
such O
g... O
I O
haven’t O
eaten O
yet, O
they O
were O
fresh O
(although O
in O
sauce), O
and O
sauce!!!! B-TARGET
such O
a O
feeling O
that O
everyone O
was O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen!!!!!! O

I O
did O
not O
eat O
it, O
I O
drank O
juice, O
I O
was O
afraid O
to O
order. O

The O
size O
of O
the O
dishes O
is O
not O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
in O
Chinese O
cuisine, O
taste, O
Taste!!! O

A O
person O
should O
enjoy O
eating O
and O
not O
think O
all O
night O
what O
the O
sauce O
is O
made O
of!!! O

I O
really O
want O
to O
think O
that O
people O
wrote O
the O
truth, O
and O
I O
just O
did O
not O
lead, O
but O
unfortunately... O
I O
will O
not O
go O
there O
anymore!!!! O

God, O
write O
the O
truth! O

P O
is O

S. O
only O
one O
review O
matched O
the O
truth, O
but O
she O
was O
more O
lucky O
than O
me))))) O

Yesterday O
with O
friends, O
decided O
to O
visit O
such O
a O
praised O
institution, B-TARGET
but O
already O
from O
the O
entrance, O
I O
began O
to O
be O
disappointed. O

Once O
we O
entered, O
no O
one O
was O
obliged O
to O
meet O
us, O
on O
the O
first O
floor, O
there O
was O
someone's O
birthday, O
apparently O
children's O
(although O
I O
don't O
think O
that O
Manila, O
the O
institution O
where O
it O
is O
worth O
organizing O
children's O
holidays). O

Then O
we O
went O
up O
to O
the O
second O
floor, O
again O
no O
one O
met O
us, O
and O
the O
restaurant O
hall O
was O
empty, O
only O
what O
company O
allowed O
us O
to O
go O
through O
(who O
it O
was, O
no O
idea, O
or O
the O
administration, O
which O
has O
already O
begun O
to O
celebrate O
March O
8th, O
whether O
very O
angry O
guests). O

After O
10 O
minutes, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
approached, O
accepted O
the O
order, O
ordered O
cocktails, O
pasta O
and O
a O
Greek O
salad O
with O
chicken. O

The O
order O
was O
waiting O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
considering O
that O
the O
pasta, O
salad O
is O
cooked O
for O
a O
maximum O
of O
half O
an O
hour, O
we O
waited O
for O
an O
hour. O

When O
I O
asked O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
so O
much O
to O
wait O
for O
our O
order, O
which O
was O
the O
answer: O
"Well, O
I O
don't O
know O
maybe O
minutes O
in O
10, O
we O
have O
a O
banquet O
down O
and O
the O
cook O
doesn't O
have O
time..." O

Regarding O
food, O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
nothing, O
medium, O
a O
little O
salted, O
the O
Caesar B-TARGET
was O
not O
very, O
the O
airy O
and O
cold O
pieces O
of O
chicken B-TARGET
filet I-TARGET
did O
not O
inspire O
me. O

Then O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
bill, O
it O
could O
not O
be O
brought O
for O
as O
long O
as O
the O
order. O

Not O
at O
all O
enthusiastic. O

I O
was O
at O
this O
restaurant O
yesterday. O

I O
went O
there O
not O
purposefully, O
so O
I O
knew O
nothing O
specific O
about O
this O
place) O

Start O
with O
the O
entrance! O

There O
is O
a O
closet B-TARGET
and O
a O
nice O
wardrobe, B-TARGET
then O
the O
view O
to O
the O
hall-good O
furniture B-TARGET
and O
a O
pleasant O
interior, B-TARGET
sadly O
there O
is O
no O
non-smoking B-TARGET
zone! I-TARGET

We O
met O
normally O
(there O
was O
no O
smile O
on O
the O
administrator's B-TARGET
face O
at O
the O
same O
time), O
led O
to O
the O
table. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
does O
not O
orientate O
in O
the O
menu, O
does O
not O
see O
the O
tables, O
everything O
rolls O
out O
of O
his O
hands, O
dirty O
plates O
stood O
on O
the O
table O
for O
10 O
minutes O
and O
this O
is O
when O
the O
hall O
is O
incomplete!!!? O

and O
yes) O

Kitchen: O
Japanese B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
large O
portions, B-TARGET
serving B-TARGET
is O
regular. O

Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
is O
also O
delicious. O

I O
heard O
that O
a O
discount O
for O
regular O
guests O
by O
name, O
no O
card, O
do O
not O
do O
- O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
this O
is O
good?! O

We O
had O
all O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
already O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
a O
kind O
look! O

A O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
sit O
in O
a O
big O
company O
and O
relax. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
I O
went O
there O
with O
friends. O

We O
took O
the O
table, O
and O
in O
5 O
minutes O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
accepted O
our O
order. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
is O
very O
large, O
so O
there O
is O
something O
to O
do. O

A O
great O
selection O
of O
desserts. B-TARGET

I O
took O
a O
tiramisu, B-TARGET
just O
mad! O

Such O
I O
tried O
only O
in O
Italy, O
surprisingly O
the O
cake B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
gentle O
and O
airy, O
just O
lick O
your O
fingers! O

But O
the O
second O
meal O
we O
waited O
for O
30 O
minutes O
- O
it O
was, O
of O
course, O
not O
good O
to O
eat, O
but O
it O
was O
worth O
it! O

A O
friend O
ordered O
a O
steak B-TARGET
ribay, I-TARGET
according O
to O
him, O
it O
was O
just O
amazing, O
but O
a O
friend O
ordered O
a O
pork B-TARGET
roll, I-TARGET
it O
was O
dry. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
their O
prices O
are O
acceptable, O
not O
to O
say O
that O
they O
are O
very O
expensive. O

The O
service, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
I O
would O
like O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
to O
work O
faster, O
but O
since O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
we O
tried O
to O
get O
into O
their O
position. O

Overall, O
a O
good O
pub, B-TARGET
impregnated O
with O
football O
themes. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
sit O
with O
a O
noisy O
company. O

I O
went O
to O
Chaplin O
Hall O
to O
share O
my O
impressions. O

The O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
good, O
to O
say O
that O
this O
restaurant O
would O
not O
be O
quite O
correct, O
it O
is O
even O
more O
a O
concert O
hall O
with O
the O
possibility O
to O
order O
food O
and O
drinks. O

The O
hall B-TARGET
is O
very O
spacious O
and O
atmospheric, O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
free O
space. B-TARGET

Comfortable O
tables B-TARGET
for O
a O
small O
company O
of O
friends. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
quite O
varied, O
there O
is O
a O
separate O
menu O
of O
Japanese O
cuisine, O
well, O
it O
is O
for O
the O
amateur. O

I O
prefer O
traditional O
cuisine. O

There O
are O
mixed O
dishes, O
for O
example, O
so O
beloved O
by O
the O
Russian O
man, O
sage O
under O
a O
coat...with O
a O
crab. O

I O
didn’t O
try O
it, O
only O
the O
name O
was O
stuck. O

I O
tried O
the O
coat B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
- O
good, O
and O
looks O
beautiful O
on O
the O
plate. O

This O
plate O
is O
much O
larger O
than O
the O
coat O
itself. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
accepted) O

The O
salad B-TARGET
is O
also O
good, O
the O
portion B-TARGET
is O
worthy. O

Coffee B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
– O
also O
without O
complaints, O
everything O
is O
delicious. O

A O
pleasant O
evening O
in O
good O
company O
in O
a O
good O
place. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
it! O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
came O
to O
Heaven O
about O
19:00 O
on O
February O
9. O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
met O
an O
unpleasant O
young B-TARGET
man. I-TARGET

Honestly, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
surprised... O

It’s O
not O
the O
first O
time O
I’ve O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
and O
I’ve O
always O
met O
such O
beautiful O
girls. O

Okay, O
let’s O
go O
on. O

There O
were O
not O
many O
people O
at O
the O
restaurant O
at O
that O
time O
of O
day. O

We O
had O
a O
huge O
choice O
of O
places. O

We O
were O
offered O
to O
sit O
on O
soft O
and O
comfortable O
sofas. B-TARGET

Of O
course O
not O
by O
the O
window, O
but O
the O
view B-TARGET
was O
always O
beautiful. O

In O
about O
5 O
minutes, O
a O
friendly O
waitress B-TARGET
approached O
us O
and O
accepted O
our O
order. O

Approximately O
15 O
minutes O
later O
we O
already O
a O
warm B-TARGET
Mexican I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and O
karpacho B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
rhinoceros. I-TARGET

The O
cold B-TARGET
snacks I-TARGET
and O
salad B-TARGET
were O
great! O

The B-TARGET
heat I-TARGET
was O
pleasant O
too. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
always O
attentive O
and O
kind. O

It O
always O
appeared O
at O
the O
time O
it O
needed. O

It O
wasn’t O
boring, O
it O
didn’t O
leave O
us O
alone. O

All O
was O
wonderful! O

We O
liked O
very O
much. O

We O
will O
come O
again O
and O
many O
more O
times. O
=) O

When O
this O
restaurant O
opened O
right O
next O
to O
the O
house, O
I O
was O
very O
pleased, O
because O
Patio O
in O
Nevsky, O
and O
the O
Planet O
of O
Sushi O
always O
rejoiced. O

When O
it O
came O
to O
the O
time O
to O
choose O
a O
place O
to O
celebrate O
the O
birthday, O
I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
think O
long. O

We O
met O
well, O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
cozy O
table B-TARGET
in O
the O
corner. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
brought O
the O
menu O
and... O
disappeared, O
20 O
minutes O
passed, O
the O
friends O
were O
ready O
to O
go O
to O
the O
kitchen O
for O
food. O

Finally, O
our O
order O
was O
accepted, O
instead O
of O
fresh O
juice O
brought O
the O
usual O
from O
a O
box, O
martini O
with O
ice, O
but O
without O
pins O
(looking O
at O
the O
previous O
comment, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
it O
is O
probably O
so O
accepted O
here). O

There O
were O
always O
different O
waiters B-TARGET
at O
the O
table, O
maybe O
3 O
or O
4....who O
would O
pay O
the O
tea????????? O

There O
was O
a O
cry O
and O
a O
strange O
thunder O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

When O
they O
brought O
the O
account O
it O
wasn’t O
written O
about O
the O
included O
teas, O
but O
the O
delivery O
was O
never O
brought O
to O
us O
(this O
is O
also O
here O
apparently O
the O
norm), O
and O
it O
was O
not O
small, O
obviously O
not O
10% O
of O
the O
order O
((( O

A O
great O
restaurant, B-TARGET
a O
good O
and O
most O
importantly O
a O
pretty O
profitable O
place B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
decent, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

I O
visited O
this O
place O
on O
my O
father’s O
anniversary. O

The O
choice O
fell O
on O
him, O
so O
we O
live O
nearby, O
and O
guests O
came O
from O
another O
city, O
so O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
somewhere O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
city. O

Let’s O
start O
with O
the O
interior. O

For O
this O
area, O
rather O
locations O
where O
there O
are O
no O
decent O
places O
in O
principle. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
pleasant. O

And O
we O
were O
met O
and O
led O
to O
the O
table, O
and O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was, O
just O
a O
miracle, O
friendly, O
attentive, O
but O
most O
importantly O
all O
in O
moderation, O
she O
was O
not O
too O
much, O
but O
the O
work O
she O
did O
at O
all O
100, O
and O
even O
200%. O

Go O
to O
the O
kitchen. O

You O
ordered O
a O
lot, O
you O
know O
the O
anniversary. O

Oh, O
horror, O
there O
was O
a O
shock. O

Yes, O
the O
first O
perception O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
the O
design, O
some O
finds O
of O
the O
cook. O

But O
for O
the O
taste!!!!!!!!!!!! O

There O
is O
nothing O
that O
was O
disgusting, O
but O
no O
judo O
was O
good O
enough. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
dried, O
the O
fish B-TARGET
is O
not O
salted, O
which O
you O
will O
not O
say O
about O
alcoholic B-TARGET
beverages. I-TARGET

The B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
map I-TARGET
is O
beautiful. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
pleased. O

In O
general, O
if O
you O
go O
there O
purposefully-better O
is O
not O
worth O
it, O
but O
if O
you O
just O
passed O
by O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
in, O
for O
curiosity, O
then O
you O
can. O

But O
I O
am O
afraid O
the O
comments O
after O
will O
not O
be O
the O
best. O

My O
friend O
highly O
recommended O
this O
place. B-TARGET

And O
since O
it O
is O
well O
located O
- O
in O
one O
of O
the O
favorite O
areas B-TARGET
of O
the O
city O
- O
I O
reached O
it O
quickly. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
liked O
it O
very O
much: O
there O
was O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
attentive, O
the O
order O
brought O
quickly. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
struck O
me: O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
interesting O
desserts, B-TARGET
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
alcoholic B-TARGET
cocktails... I-TARGET
indeed, O
prices O
are O
far O
from O
low, O
especially O
on O
hot B-TARGET
and O
salads. B-TARGET

A O
little O
above O
the O
average, O
I O
think. O

But O
in O
subsequent O
times O
I O
was O
disappointed: O
there O
are O
almost O
no O
free B-TARGET
places, I-TARGET
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
have O
no O
time, O
there O
are O
almost O
no O
desserts. B-TARGET

No O
matter O
what, O
I O
like O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
this O
place. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
impressive. O

By O
the O
way, O
the O
last O
time O
I O
ate O
pasta B-TARGET
4 I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
taste O
and O
size O
of O
the O
portion) O

I O
have O
never O
taken O
this O
institution O
seriously, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
often O
go O
there. O

But... O
if O
I O
went O
there O
before O
to O
drink, O
well))), O
or O
eat O
fast, O
then, O
not O
so O
long O
ago, O
I O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
full-fledged O
dinner O
there. O

I O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
impressions O
remained O
only O
positive, O
not O
without O
curiosities, O
but... O
nevertheless, O
remained O
satisfied. O

Meeted O
mentally, O
there O
are O
no O
complaints O
here O
and O
there O
was O
never, O
before O
the O
table O
was O
not O
held, O
there O
is O
no O
minus O
(left O
the O
right O
to O
choose O
for O
me))) O
). O

It O
was O
in O
the O
evening, O
so O
lighted O
the O
candles, B-TARGET
lighted O
the O
lights O
and..... O
ladies O
and O
gentlemen, O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
it O
became O
so O
cozy O
that O
I O
would O
never O
have O
thought O
that O
this O
institution B-TARGET
in O
the O
daylight O
looks O
like O
a O
cafe. O

In O
short, O
the O
dim B-TARGET
light, I-TARGET
calm O
music, B-TARGET
sweet O
and O
caring O
staff B-TARGET
- O
did O
their O
job O
- O
made O
you O
relax))) O

I’m O
not O
going O
to O
say O
much O
about O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
– O
it’s O
all O
worth O
it. O

"Capreze", B-TARGET
medallions, B-TARGET
"Caesar", B-TARGET
the B-TARGET
brand I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
- O
did O
not O
produce O
special O
enthusiasm, O
but O
also O
complaints, O
and O
this O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(I O
repeat) O
made O
an O
indelible O
impression. O

I O
recommend, O
especially O
those O
who O
were O
there O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
come O
in O
the O
evening, O
believe O
me, O
you O
will O
get O
to O
an O
entirely O
different O
institution. B-TARGET

Special O
thanks O
to O
Irina, O
for O
her O
attentive O
and O
polite O
service. B-TARGET

I O
decided O
one O
thing O
for O
myself, O
I O
will O
come O
back O
many O
times. O

thank O
you! O

I O
went O
to O
three O
different O
Roma O
restaurants. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
good. O

Dishes O
are O
cooked O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
or O
they O
are O
carried O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
although O
the O
people O
were O
all O
twice O
a O
little O
- O
it O
would O
seem... O

Once O
there O
was O
a O
feeling O
that O
we O
were O
forgotten. O

But O
the O
worst O
thing O
is O
that O
there O
is O
always O
something O
out O
of O
the O
menu O
- O
and, O
as O
a O
result, O
exactly O
what O
you O
want O
to O
try! O

The O
choice O
of O
desserts B-TARGET
is O
small. O

The O
cake B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone. O

But O
pizza B-TARGET
is O
not O
a O
fountain O
- O
the O
usual O
one, O
nothing O
special. O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
that O
is O
taken O
for O
it. O

Last O
Saturday O
I O
visited O
this O
place O
with O
my O
friends. O

It O
all O
started O
with O
not O
very O
pleasant O
moments, O
because O
when O
we O
came O
there, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
there O
were O
no O
free O
tables O
and O
only O
after O
probably O
20 O
minutes O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
all O
found O
us O
a O
suitable O
table. O

In O
general, O
the O
institution B-TARGET
liked, O
and O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
and O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

Of O
the O
pros: O
fairly O
fast O
service B-TARGET
despite O
the O
huge O
number O
of O
people, O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(played O
DJs) O
for O
Saturday O
evening, O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
alcoholic B-TARGET
beverages I-TARGET
(although O
we O
did O
not O
eat, O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
alcohol O
was O
drunk))). O

Disadvantages: O
It O
seemed O
that O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
playing O
too O
loud; O
the O
lack O
of O
lighting B-TARGET
over I-TARGET
the O
table O
(although O
over O
some O
others O
there O
was O
still O
light), O
which O
caused O
me O
to O
light O
the O
menu O
with O
the O
phone O
and O
probably O
the O
main O
disadvantage O
for O
me O
is O
that O
in O
such O
a O
large O
institution B-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
place O
for O
the O
wardrobe, B-TARGET
as O
a O
result O
of O
which O
our O
jackets O
were O
constantly O
falling O
on O
the O
floor O
from O
the O
couch. O

We O
asked O
for O
a O
deposit B-TARGET
of O
5 O
thousand O
for O
our O
table, O
but O
for O
a O
large O
company O
this O
is O
not O
so O
much, O
we, O
for O
example, O
left O
there O
8 O
thousand. O

But O
despite O
all O
the O
disadvantages, O
remained O
quite O
satisfied O
with O
this O
establishment, B-TARGET
I O
think O
we O
will O
visit O
again. O

Well, O
and O
a O
nice O
little O
thing O
at O
the O
end, O
we O
asked O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
for O
a O
discount O
card O
and O
he O
gave O
us O
it. O

So O
there O
will O
be O
no O
reason O
to O
come O
in O
and O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
discount.) O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
twice. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleased, O
the O
drawers O
change O
after O
each O
visitor, O
everything O
is O
very O
clean. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
prepared, O
can O
tell O
you O
what O
to O
prepare, O
how O
to O
serve. O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
large O
enough. O

Everything O
is O
delicious! O

The O
only O
minus O
- O
on O
holidays O
and O
weekends O
they O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
visitors, O
although O
this O
suggests O
that O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
good. O

They O
cook O
for O
a O
long O
time! O

Snacks O
and O
salads O
come O
quickly, O
and O
hot O
ones O
have O
to O
wait. O

We O
were O
given O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
– O
ice O
cream O
for O
the O
child. O

They O
make O
ice B-TARGET
cream O
themselves. O

Very O
delicious! O

Hi O
to O
you. O

I O
was O
in O
this O
BAR O
28.10.09, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
special O
to O
stand O
out, O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
quite O
expensive O
and O
then O
the O
beer O
"Beresta B-TARGET
light" I-TARGET
220r O
I O
did O
not O
like O
very O
much, O
but O
the O
snacks B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
beer O
I O
really O
liked O
and O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
their O
large O
selection O
with O
the O
predominance O
of O
meat, O
which O
for O
me O
personally O
is O
very O
important. O

This O
bar O
is O
suitable O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
watch O
football, O
drink O
beer, O
beer O
because O
for O
drinking O
other O
drinks O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
place O
because O
alcohol O
here O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
in O
some O
restaurants O
where O
you O
will O
find O
better O
quality O
of O
service, O
live O
music, O
and O
a O
larger O
set O
of O
dishes O
that O
are O
suitable O
for O
drinking O
strong O
alcoholic O
beverages, O
very O
suitable O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
just O
chat O
in O
a O
quiet O
environment. O

I O
was O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
my O
friends O
last O
night O
and O
I O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

We O
met, O
offered O
to O
choose O
a O
table, O
the O
people O
were O
few, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
pleasant. O

Immediately O
came O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
with O
dark O
hair, O
unfortunately O
I O
did O
not O
remember O
the O
name, O
the O
service B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
excellent, O
you O
will O
not O
say O
anything O
here! O

On O
my O
request O
to O
help O
choose O
a O
dish, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
gladly O
offered O
us O
a O
couple O
of O
salads O
and O
hot, O
cooked O
everything O
very O
quickly O
and O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
deliciously O
tasty. O

Very O
happy O
to O
come O
here, O
although O
it O
is O
far O
away, O
but O
I O
have O
never O
regretted, O
I O
will O
recommend O
this O
institution B-TARGET
to O
all O
my O
friends. O

Good O
time O
to O
you!! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
a O
large O
roll B-TARGET
that O
can O
not O
even O
fit O
in O
your O
mouth, O
then O
you O
are O
here. O

There O
are O
wonderful O
rolls B-TARGET
here, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
other O
European B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

Such O
rolls B-TARGET
as O
in O
this O
cafe O
I O
did O
not O
meet O
anywhere O
else, O
I O
go O
here O
specifically O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
city, O
but O
this O
justifies, O
in O
general, O
the O
institution B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
without O
ordering O
a O
table O
of O
places O
was O
not O
to O
be O
found O
and O
this O
even O
on O
weekdays, O
now O
there O
are O
almost O
always O
places, O
and O
in O
the O
summer O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
also O
helps. O

In O
terms O
of O
prices, O
I O
can O
say O
so O
if O
you O
eat O
and O
rolls O
and O
some O
dish, O
dessert, O
cold O
drinks, O
then O
you O
get O
1450-1750p O
per O
person, O
but O
not O
everyone O
can O
eat O
so O
you O
can O
turn O
to O
a O
great O
appetite, O
and O
so O
750p O
can O
be O
enough. O

I O
have O
been O
visiting O
this O
place B-TARGET
for O
two O
years, O
the O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
has O
not O
changed O
and O
the O
consistency O
is O
a O
sign O
of O
professionalism. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
several O
times O
and O
I O
have O
the O
following O
impressions: O
1) O

the O
food. O

Quite O
uniform O
food B-TARGET
as O
in O
many O
other O
Chinese O
restaurants O
(that O
fish, B-TARGET
that O
meat B-TARGET
- O
all O
for O
the O
same O
taste, O
all O
with O
the O
same O
sauce), B-TARGET
all O
of O
course O
edible, O
but O
not O
to O
say O
that O
very O
delicious. O

Of O
the O
desserts O
I O
really O
liked O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
garganzola I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
(but O
this O
is, O
of O
course, O
not O
their O
preparation) O

of O
service. O

It O
all O
depends O
on O
the B-TARGET
waitress, I-TARGET
there O
are O
friendly, O
and O
there O
are O
not O
very. O

The O
situation. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
poor, O
some O
linoleum B-TARGET
on O
the O
floor. O

The O
music B-TARGET
is O
too O
loud O
and O
obsessive. O

It O
plays O
Russian B-TARGET
radio I-TARGET
– O
and O
it’s O
terrible! O

Of O
the O
pros, O
we O
can O
only O
note O
that O
there O
are O
always O
few O
people O
in O
this O
institution, B-TARGET
there O
are O
always O
a O
lot O
of O
free O
places. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
the O
first O
impression O
was O
great, O
but O
the O
truth O
that O
I O
did O
not O
like O
it O
was O
that O
we O
ordered O
a O
table O
at O
the O
window O
in O
advance, O
but O
we O
were O
put O
in O
the O
most O
terrible O
place! O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
nice, O
not O
obsessive, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
great! O

As O
for O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
honestly, O
I O
didn’t O
like O
it. O

The O
meat O
was O
waiting O
for O
30 O
minutes, O
if O
not O
more. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
too, O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
not O
delicious. O

I O
was O
with O
my O
four O
friends O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

What O
can O
I O
say: O
1. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
I O
liked, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant, O
sociable O
and O
friendly, O
on O
our O
request O
without O
problems O
photographed O
us, O
food O
brought O
quickly, O
excess O
dishes O
also O
did O
not O
stay O
on O
the O
table. O

In O
the O
closet O
the O
uncle B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
polite O
and O
everyone O
else O
who O
saw O
from O
the O
staff B-TARGET
made O
a O
pleasant O
impression. O

It O
was O
Sunday O
at O
15:30, O
there O
was O
no O
one, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
surprised, O
then O
there O
were O
more O
people O
of O
course. O

The O
hall B-TARGET
is O
large, O
the O
furniture B-TARGET
is O
decent, O
a O
large O
TV B-TARGET
on O
the O
wall O
is O
convenient O
to O
watch O
from O
any O
table O
probably. O

At O
first, O
they O
wanted O
to O
order O
Czech B-TARGET
alcoholic I-TARGET
beverages, I-TARGET
but O
they O
did O
not, O
unfortunately, O
a O
little O
upset, O
but O
not O
very O
much. O

I O
ordered O
a O
whiskey, O
I O
liked O
it. O

We O
also O
ordered O
meat O
varieties, O
and O
cabbage O
roasted O
with O
meat. O

There O
are O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of O
the O
food. O

Not O
great, O
but O
at O
a O
level. O

Overall, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
made O
a O
good O
impression. O

About O
a O
month O
ago O
we O
visited O
this O
institution, O
because O
many O
recommended O
it O
as O
a O
wonderful O
place. B-TARGET

Yes, O
really, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
pleasant. O

Like O
most O
of O
the O
acquaintances O
who O
visited O
this O
place, B-TARGET
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
very O
disposed O
to O
friendly, O
warm O
communication. O

Staff B-TARGET
friendly O
and O
responsive. O

Food B-TARGET
at O
the O
level O
and O
what O
pleased O
– O
large O
portions)) B-TARGET

If O
you O
talk O
about O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
this O
restaurant, O
it O
is O
very O
crowded O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
there O
in O
the O
evening, O
then O
be O
sure O
to O
book O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

Visited O
on O
October O
15. O

Wedding O
for O
two. O

remained O
in O
full O
enthusiasm. O

The O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
really O
good. O

Especially O
great O
for O
the O
bedroom O
area. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
impressive, O
very O
kindly, O
beautiful, O
stylish. O

The B-TARGET
tables, I-TARGET
which O
was O
liked, O
are O
arranged O
remotely O
from O
each O
other, O
visitors O
do O
not O
interfere O
with O
each O
other, O
they O
are O
not O
seen O
or O
heard, O
a O
certain O
isolated O
comfort O
is O
created. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
great! O

There O
were O
two O
waiters, O
our O
table O
was O
served O
by O
a O
young O
man O
named O
( O

Sorry, O
but O
I O
forgot O
my O
name O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
:) O

But O
served O
in O
the O
highest O
class: O
warning, O
correct, O
non-obsessive. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
at O
the O
height: O
salads B-TARGET
are O
unusual, O
delicious, O
portions B-TARGET
are O
very O
decent O
in O
size. O

Warm B-TARGET
is O
worn. O

Medallions B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
calf I-TARGET
are O
stunning, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
melts O
in O
the O
mouth, O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
very O
delicious. O

The O
duck B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
orange O
sauce O
also O
went O
to O
fame. O

Dessert, B-TARGET
biscuits B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
fruits, I-TARGET
also O
proved O
good, O
although O
at O
the O
very O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
- O
tired O
of O
eating O
:) O

The O
result O
is: O
2 O
glasses O
of O
cognac O
50 O

3 O
glasses O
of O
red O
dry O
wine O

you. O

Recommended O
to O
all. O

A O
few O
days O
ago, O
I O
visited O
a O
terrace O
where O
I O
hadn’t O
been O
for O
a O
few O
months. O

I O
missed O
it!) O

We O
arrived O
in O
a O
small O
company O
at O
9 O
p.m. O

The O
people O
at O
this O
time O
gathered O
extremely O
glamorous, O
everything O
around O
was O
full O
of O
brands O
and O
jewelry. O

I O
like O
stylish O
glamour O
(I O
don’t O
know O
if O
this O
expression O
is O
used) O
rather O
than... O
pink. O

It O
was O
me O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
at O
the O
next O
table O
were O
two O
ladies O
sitting O
from O
legs O
to O
heads O
in O
pink. O

Very O
funny O
and O
fun.) O

At O
11 O
a.m. O
(we O
sat O
a O
long O
time) O
three O
young O
people O
sat O
down O
to O
meet O
us. O

We O
didn’t O
get O
to O
know O
them, O
but O
fortunately O
they O
didn’t O
ruin O
our O
mood. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
good: O
attentive, O
without O
judgmental O
views, O
and O
waiting O
for O
hours O
she O
did O
not O
have O
to. O

The O
service B-TARGET
in O
the O
terrace O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
happen O
once O
in O
a O
while. O

Lucky O
this O
time. O

The O
kitchen, B-TARGET
as O
always. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
interesting O
and O
diverse. O

Salads B-TARGET
and O
pasta B-TARGET
are O
awesome. O

Alcohol B-TARGET
is O
really O
delicious.) O

Prices O
are O
acceptable. O

Overall, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
does O
not O
disappoint O
and O
continues O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
favorite O
places. O

Today O
I O
visited O
this O
institution O
with O
a O
friend! O
very O
much O
everything O
liked, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
delighted O
at O
the O
entrance, O
the O
kind O
and O
smiling O
administrator B-TARGET
Catherine O
met O
us O
and O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
very O
good O
table, B-TARGET
from O
which O
a O
great O
view B-TARGET
opened. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
waitress. B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
the O
foundation, B-TARGET
served O
us O
very O
quickly O
and O
what O
pleased O
it O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
meal. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
know O
their O
job O
very O
well. O

The O
good O
guys. O

Now O
"The B-TARGET
Artist's I-TARGET
House" I-TARGET
will O
be O
a O
frequently O
visited O
place O
in O
our O
city. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
good O
mood O
for O
the O
whole O
day!! O

I O
want O
to O
leave O
my O
feedback O
about O
this O
wonderful O
cafe. B-TARGET

I O
celebrated O
my O
mom’s O
anniversary O
and O
it O
was O
wonderful! O

There O
was O
no O
disappointment, O
everyone O
liked O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Large O
portions, B-TARGET
interesting O
salads B-TARGET
and O
hot, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
very O
savory O
and O
delicious O
for O
a O
relatively O
small O
price! O

Very O
pleasant O
unobtrusive O
service! B-TARGET

Special O
thanks O
to O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Sergei! O

Only O
good O
memories O
remain. O

What O
a O
delicious O
cake! B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
wonderful O
cafe! B-TARGET

Perfect O
for O
small O
banquets. O

Comfortable O
and O
home! O

It O
was O
celebrated O
in O
the O
caravan O
- O
the O
birthday O
of O
the O
husband. O

Initially, O
the O
party O
was O
planned O
elsewhere, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
free O
tables, O
and O
therefore O
the O
will O
of O
fate O
was O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
room O
is O
not O
large, O
but O
very O
cozy. O

We O
booked O
a O
table O
behind O
the O
window O
so O
that O
no O
one O
would O
bother. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
the O
work O
of O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
in O
the O
matter O
of O
service. B-TARGET

Everything O
was O
done O
quickly, O
qualitatively O
and O
most O
importantly O
unnoticed!!!! O
really O
once O
the O
wine O
still O
poured. O

Food: O
Decided O
in O
addition O
to O
standard O
dishes O
(shurvy, O
chopsticks....) O
to O
order O
a O
large O
plate O
of O
Casan O
Cabob. O

It O
is O
prepared O
for O
1.5 O
hours, O
but O
it O
is O
very O
delicious. O

In O
general, O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
of O
the O
cat. O
we O
ordered O
were O
prepared O
from O
fresh O
high-quality O
products.so B-TARGET
summarizing O
I O
will O
say O
that O
there O
really O
can O
be O
tasty O
to O
eat, O
but O
when O
paid O
for O
the O
bill, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
just O
did O
not O
bring O
back O
the O
delivery!!!!!!! O

Apparently O
he O
calculated O
that O
1000 O
rubles O
we O
decided O
to O
leave O
him O
for O
tea! O

And O
even O
when O
they O
tried O
to O
suspect O
him O
to O
bring O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dishes O
with O
him, O
he O
simply O
turned O
around O
and O
went O
to O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
room. O

I O
was O
afraid O
to O
start O
taking O
the O
money O
:) O

I O
think O
not O
very O
beautiful. O

I O
usually O
go O
there O
after O
dinner O
with O
my O
husband. O

I O
like O
the O
calm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
quiet O
background O
music B-TARGET
does O
not O
interfere O
with O
the O
conversation, O
there O
is O
always O
a O
free O
table. B-TARGET

I O
don’t O
really O
understand O
people O
who O
think O
about O
it. O

I O
am O
much O
quieter O
and O
more O
comfortable O
in O
the O
institution, B-TARGET
where O
there O
is O
no O
crowd, O
no O
noise O
and O
noise. O

I O
also O
love O
the O
Japanese O
cuisine O
in O
St. O
Petersburg. O

Very O
acceptable, O
at O
more O
than O
acceptable O
prices. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
is O
not O
worried. O

Of O
course, O
I O
would O
like O
a O
little O
more O
range O
of O
roles, B-TARGET
but O
those O
that O
are O
there O
are O
very O
liked. O

The O
soup B-TARGET
is O
always O
great! O

Very O
good O
fresh B-TARGET
juice. I-TARGET

There O
is O
a O
small O
European O
menu. O

Not O
bad O
either. O

Draniques B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
bacon I-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty O
and O
the O
portion O
is O
really O
"male". O

We O
are O
lucky O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Once O
they O
got O
to O
an O
inexperienced O
waitress, B-TARGET
who O
remained O
dissatisfied, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
see O
her O
again. O

Usually O
everything O
is O
done O
quickly, O
not O
ignored, O
warned O
if O
something O
from O
the O
menu O
will O
have O
to O
wait. O

The O
first O
time O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
half O
an O
hour, O
we O
got O
a O
discount O
card. O

Discount O
is O
always O
provided, O
even O
if O
the O
cards O
are O
not O
with O
you O
(found O
by O
name). O

In O
general, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
satisfied, O
non-obsessive, O
but O
attentive. O

It’s O
the O
only O
place B-TARGET
in O
St. O
Petersburg O
where O
I’m O
quietly O
eating O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls, B-TARGET
regardless O
of O
pregnancy. O

I O
am O
scared O
in O
other O
places O
😉 O

No, O
the O
avatar O
is O
not O
a O
photo O
of O
the O
bartender)) O
so O
asked O
for O
more O
details. O

I O
will O
try) O
from O
the O
street O
it O
is O
almost O
not O
visible, O
and O
the B-TARGET
sign I-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
willing O
to O
enter... O
so O
it O
would O
not O
have O
come, O
honestly. O

But O
friends O
called. O
and O
I O
didn't O
regret O
it! O
inside O
very O
nice!space O
is O
little, O
I O
don't O
even O
know, O
plus O
this O
or O
minus.literally O
5-6 O
tables, B-TARGET
well O
and O
bar B-TARGET
stand) I-TARGET
very O
cozy) O
most O
cool- O
table B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
hall, O
in O
the O
corner, O
with O
a O
couch B-TARGET
and O
pillows) B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
interior. B-TARGET
in O
light O
tones, O
paintings B-TARGET
hanging, O
curtains B-TARGET
made O
of O
pearls, O
or O
something O
else) O

The O
menu. O

The B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
card I-TARGET
is O
good. O
there O
is O
something O
to O
choose O
from. O
the O
price O
of O
calyan B-TARGET
seemed O
overpriced O
to O
me. O

The O
choice O
of O
food B-TARGET
is O
small. O
ordered O
a O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fruits I-TARGET
and O
salads B-TARGET
(honestly, O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
the O
name). O
all O
like O
the O
picture-beautiful). O
but O
again, O
here O
is O
the O
minus O
of O
a O
small O
room. B-TARGET

I O
go O
wait O
for O
15 O
minutes, O
not O
less. O
and O
since O
the O
bartender O
is O
one O
and O
drinks O
also O
bring O
as O
everyone O
is O
prepared.. O

In O
this O
restaurant O
we O
celebrated O
the O
10th O
anniversary O
of O
our O
wedding. O

We O
and O
our O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
quiet O
and O
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

I O
especially O
liked O
how O
delicious O
the O
tiramisu B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
was O
prepared. O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
such O
a O
delicious O
dessert B-TARGET
in O
any O
restaurant. O

We O
left O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
and O
rested. O

My O
husband’s O
birthday O
is O
coming O
and O
we’ll O
celebrate O
it O
here. O

A O
week O
ago O
we O
went O
to O
see O
the O
new O
building. O

The O
table O
was O
ordered O
but O
could O
not O
be O
ordered, O
there O
were O
free O
tables. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
2 O
rooms O
and O
a O
karaoke O
room O
(it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
see O
it, O
it O
is O
not O
open O
every O
day). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
in O
our O
room O
we O
liked O
- O
cozy, O
beautiful O
furniture. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
menu O
is O
not O
very O
large, O
the O
prices O
are O
average. O

The O
lack O
of O
some O
ordered O
salads O
explained O
to O
us O
with O
a O
great O
demand O
:-) O

Somewhat O
surprised O
by O
the O
huge O
number O
of O
service B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
per O
square O
meter O
and O
visitor, O
our O
table O
was O
served O
by O
two, O
although O
we O
were O
at O
the O
table O
only O
5 O
people. O

Staff B-TARGET
constantly O
walks O
through O
the O
halls, O
there O
are O
several O
"meeting" O
at O
the O
entrance. O

The O
government O
is O
not O
feeling O
the O
crisis O
yet. O

There O
were O
no O
claims O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
salads, B-TARGET
but O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
not O
impressed, O
we O
felt O
that O
they O
were O
not O
prepared O
in O
a O
restaurant. O

Per O
you O
will O
need O
to O
go O
in O
again O
to O
see O
the O
dynamics O
of O
development... O

The O
first O
time O
we O
went O
to O
the B-TARGET
beach I-TARGET
and O
stayed O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
evening!!! O
there O
was O
no O
negative O
moment, O
which O
rarely O
happens! O
=) O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
huge, O
but O
very O
cozy O
and O
really O
a O
lot O
of O
space! O

The O
tables B-TARGET
don’t O
stand O
up, O
I O
think, O
even O
with O
a O
large O
crowd, O
visitors O
don’t O
feel O
like O
seals O
in O
a O
barrel O
(we O
were O
on O
Tuesday, O
it O
was O
quite O
spacious). O

I O
liked O
the O
local O
beer.) B-TARGET

I O
tried O
almost O
everything! O

Malinovo B-TARGET
"Aptekarskoe" I-TARGET
is O
very O
original! O

Service B-TARGET
is O
great! O
all O
on O
time, O
drinks O
- O
almost O
instantaneously! O
cute O
girl B-TARGET
Anna O
told O
us O
everything O
and O
gave O
detailed O
advice O
on O
the O
menu, O
clearly O
and O
quickly. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
talk O
to O
her, O
thank O
you! O

Salads B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
pork B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
feta I-TARGET
cheese, I-TARGET
fistakes I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mushroom I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
- O
it's O
just O
an O
excitement!!! O

Pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood I-TARGET
in O
pergament O
- O
very O
original, O
chic O
tomato B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
delicate O
taste, O
thyme O
branches O
- O
very O
spicy! O

I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
original O
dishes B-TARGET
in O
the O
menu, O
and O
it O
is O
definitely O
worth O
going O
to O
the O
coastline B-TARGET
for O
fresh O
culinary O
impressions! O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
there O
again O
and O
will O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
our O
friends! O

Yes, O
it’s O
something, O
I O
can’t O
even O
say O
how, O
but O
I’ll O
try. O

I O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant, B-TARGET
a O
fairy O
tale! O
a O
fairy O
tale! O

We O
met O
with O
a O
smile. O

Very O
pleasant. O

They O
showed O
me O
a O
free O
table O
for O
two, O
and O
I O
was. O

All O
right, O
I O
like O
to O
walk O
alone. O

A O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
brought O
me O
a O
menu. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
good, O
modest. O

I O
sit O
down O
and O
think O
what O
to O
choose O
on O
such O
an O
empty O
stomach. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
I O
wanted: O
a O
salad O
of O
beef O
cuttings O
(290p), O
a O
meat O
soup O
(210p), O
a O
lamb’s O
curry O
(680p). O

When O
ordering O
still O
wanted O
to O
take O
the O
juice, O
the O
girl O
advised O
natural O
morse, O
I O
agreed. O

What O
a O
wonderful O
salad! B-TARGET

I O
have O
not O
tried O
such. O

The O
soup B-TARGET
is O
even O
better. O

very O
unusual. O

I’ll O
be O
a O
cow, B-TARGET
I’ll O
be O
again. O

Until O
I O
break, O
one O
portion O
will O
probably O
be O
enough. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
great O
cook. B-TARGET

Keep O
it O
so! O

It O
was O
delicious! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
all O
with O
taste. O

Color, B-TARGET
range, B-TARGET
chairs B-TARGET
- O
all O
beautiful O
and O
comfortable. O

Like O
in O
the O
kingdom. O

It O
is O
best O
to O
come O
here O
for O
dinner O
with O
a O
loved O
one. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
good. O

There O
are O
some O
shortcomings, O
but O
I O
think O
they O
will O
resolve O
themselves. O

8 O
but O
I O
give O
9. O

Because O
you O
can O
see O
that O
people O
are O
looking O
for O
the O
best. O

I O
will O
definitely O
come O
again. O

Three O
days O
ago O
we O
celebrated O
our O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Today O
I O
decided O
to O
read O
reviews O
about O
this O
institution, B-TARGET
because O
the O
evening O
was O
just O
ruined. O

It O
makes O
the O
impression O
that O
we O
were O
somewhere O
else. O

Yes, O
not O
a O
bad O
interior, B-TARGET
not O
a O
bad O
kitchen... B-TARGET
but O
everything O
else O
is O
just O
horror. O

At O
first, O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
such O
disgusting O
service B-TARGET
anywhere. O

There O
was O
only O
one O
waitress B-TARGET
at O
the O
restaurant, O
which O
is O
strange. O

If O
she O
just O
didn’t O
cope O
with O
the O
abundance O
of O
orders, O
then O
it’s O
sorry, O
but O
she O
didn’t O
really O
try. O

For O
example, O
we O
were O
given O
wine O
for O
20 O
minutes, O
we O
went O
out O
on O
the O
street O
to O
smoke, O
where O
there O
are O
chairs O
and O
tables O
for O
this, O
we O
asked O
her O
to O
bring O
a O
ashes... O
she O
promised, O
but O
until O
the O
end O
of O
our O
feast O
she O
did O
not. O

For O
a O
snack, O
we O
ordered O
olives, O
among O
other O
things, O
so O
they O
brought O
us O
almost O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
about O
one O
order O
she O
generally O
forgot, O
for O
which O
she O
simply O
apologized. O

A O
separate O
story O
is O
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

A O
good O
singer, O
with O
a O
good O
voice... O
but O
for O
such O
a O
small O
room, B-TARGET
it’s O
just O
a O
quiet O
horror. O

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
talk O
not O
only O
with O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
table, O
but O
also O
the O
neighbors O
on O
the O
right-left O
had O
to O
question. O

I O
agree, O
the O
taste O
and O
color O
of O
comrades O
are O
not, O
but O
I O
will O
no O
longer O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
my O
feet O
and O
all O
my O
friends O
will O
definitely O
warn. O

Great O
place B-TARGET
with O
great O
kitchen. B-TARGET

I O
read O
a O
lot O
of O
reviews, O
honestly, O
more O
than O
half O
of O
them O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
lie. O

Someone O
wrote O
about O
salads O
from O
the O
refrigerator O
and O
not O
a O
delicious O
lavish. O

Everything O
is O
not O
true. O

The O
salads B-TARGET
are O
fresh, O
the O
ingredients O
are O
clearly O
not O
from O
the O
tape O
and O
the O
refrigerator. O

Lava B-TARGET
was O
fresh, O
eaten O
immediately, O
not O
even O
a O
salad O
had O
time O
to O
bring. O

Someone O
said O
that O
meat O
is O
cooked O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

Yes, O
not O
in O
10 O
minutes O
bring, O
but O
immediately O
say, O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
40 O
minutes. O

Shashlik B-TARGET
is O
fresh, O
melting, O
no O
fat O
and O
bones. O

The O
equipment B-TARGET
is O
not O
alone. O

Of O
the O
disadvantages O
(for O
me O
this O
is O
not O
a O
minus), O
there O
is O
no O
separate O
room B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
smokers, I-TARGET
well, O
and O
maybe O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
annoying O
(although O
I O
think O
it’s O
right). O

The O
glasses O
are O
always O
full O
and O
you O
don’t O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
get O
to O
you O
(in O
many O
institutions O
it’s O
the O
way). O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
quite O
normal, O
not O
huge, O
but O
not O
small. O

The O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
the O
prices. O

Cheap O
and O
very O
delicious. O

How O
much O
we O
ate O
and O
drank O
for O
six O
people, O
in O
other O
establishments O
would O
simply O
be O
two O
or O
three O
times O
more O
expensive. O

They O
left O
satisfied O
and O
satisfied. O

Here, O
according O
to O
reviews, O
this O
place O
was O
visited, O
people O
ranked, O
at O
least O
deputies. O

So O
if O
you O
have O
money, O
you O
can O
go O
to O
other O
restaurants O
and O
not O
write O
nonsense O
about O
salads O
from O
the O
refrigerator. O

Next O
to O
the O
Book O
House, O
with O
windows O
on O
the O
shore, O
there O
is O
a O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
delicious O
name O
"Apetit". O

Several O
rooms B-TARGET
are O
conveniently O
located, O
although O
a O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
located O
right O
at O
the O
entrance. O

The O
most O
comfortable O
couch B-TARGET
in O
the O
area B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
smokers. I-TARGET

Fashion O
is O
broadcast O
on O
large O
screens. O
a O
pleasant, O
quiet O
interior B-TARGET
for O
friendly O
meetings. O

Until O
those O
weekends O
I O
liked O
it... O
“Everything O
mixed O
up O
in O
the O
house...” O
(c) O

Service B-TARGET
is O
bad. O

We O
met, O
sat O
down, O
gave O
the O
menu O
- O
normal. O

Apparently O
the O
girl B-TARGET
worked O
if O
not O
the O
first O
day, O
then O
the O
second. O

Maybe O
it O
will O
be O
better, O
learning O
is O
always O
useful. O

But O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
given O
a O
pasta O
for O
1.5 O
hours O
is O
barbaric. O

I O
almost O
died O
of O
hunger. O

The O
soup B-TARGET
was O
well O
eaten. O

What O
about O
the O
kitchen: O
has O
the O
cook B-TARGET
changed? O

My O
order: O
Misso;I O
wanted O
soup O
with O
Norwegian O
salmon, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
there O
was O
no O
salmon B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant, O
which O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
told O
us O
minutes O
after O
twenty O
(another O
stone O
in O
her O
garden); O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushrooms, I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
paste I-TARGET
(mainly O
I O
had O
to O
eat O
just O
tomato B-TARGET
paste). O

I O
have O
a O
favorite O
appetite. B-TARGET
( O

The O
first O
time O
I O
had O
an O
appetite O
was O
a O
year O
ago. O

I O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
meeting, O
the O
service O
and O
the O
kitchen O
(+ O
pleased O
with O
the O
democratic O
order O
of O
prices). O

And O
here, O
based O
on O
my O
positive O
impressions O
and O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
our O
location, O
decided O
to O
sit O
there O
with O
friends. O

We O
were O
four O
people. O

They O
came, O
met O
us, O
hosted O
us, O
placed O
us, O
brought O
a O
menu O
and... O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
disappeared O
for O
20 O
minutes O
(although O
there O
were O
not O
many O
visitors O
in O
the O
restaurant). O

Called, O
came, O
ordered O
pasta, O
fresh O
juice, O
drinks. O

Within O
15 O
minutes O
they O
brought O
drinks. O

Another O
15 O
minutes O
later O
the O
first O
portion O
of O
the O
paste O
appeared... O
the O
second O
and O
third O
were O
served O
another O
15 O
minutes O
later, O
and O
the O
last O
portion O
was O
brought O
when O
the O
others O
had O
finished. O

Then O
there O
was O
an O
order O
for O
Caesar O
salad O
and O
American... O

I O
waited O
a O
long O
time... O
patience O
at O
the O
limit... O
the O
outcome O
was O
not O
left O
(per O
this O
is O
not O
quite O
right, O
the O
person O
still O
worked, O
but... O
thank O
you O
deserved O
only O
on O
words) O

The O
beer, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
is O
delicious.. O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not. O
ordered O
a O
plate O
for O
beer, O
so O
that O
the O
beer O
was O
with O
something O
to O
drink O
and O
meat. O

The O
plate O
to O
the O
beer O
was O
brought O
when O
they O
had O
already O
taken O
2 O
cups O
of O
beer. O

If O
the O
establishment O
still O
calls O
itself O
a O
restaurant, O
then O
be O
kind O
to O
bring O
at O
least O
hot O
food O
to O
everyone O
at O
the O
same O
time! O

A O
company O
of O
4 O
people, O
each O
received O
their O
portion O
after O
a O
long O
time, O
although O
some O
dishes O
were O
the O
same. O

The O
meat O
was O
very O
long O
awaited, O
and O
they O
brought O
the O
garner O
first, O
and O
40 O
minutes O
later O
the O
meat. O

And O
when O
asked O
why O
so, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
said: O
Well O
I O
brought O
you O
a O
dressing, O
and O
you O
ate O
it... O
here O
is O
your O
meat)))))))))) O

Good O
day. O

It O
was O
celebrated O
in O
this O
restaurant O
on O
March O
7, O
there O
was O
a O
banquet O
for O
20 O
people. O

Since O
they O
opened O
recently, O
there O
are O
no O
reviews, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
scary O
to O
go O
to O
a O
new O
place, O
but O
since O
we O
live O
nearby, O
we O
decided O
to O
take O
a O
risk, O
and O
we O
did O
not O
regret!!! O

All O
paid O
in O
advance, O
we O
helped O
to O
make O
the O
menu O
individually O
for O
our O
requests O
and O
budget. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
arrived, O
everything O
was O
ready, O
the O
tables O
were O
covered, O
the O
food O
was O
brought. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
simple, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
large, O
everyone O
is O
very O
pleased! O

Pleasantly O
surprised O
the O
program B-TARGET
- O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
(the O
girl O
sang O
very O
beautifully), O
and O
the O
Georgian B-TARGET
dance I-TARGET
team, I-TARGET
amazing!!! O

The O
hall B-TARGET
was O
very O
large, O
bright, O
besides O
us O
there O
were O
2 O
other O
banquets, O
but O
because O
of O
the O
large O
space O
nobody O
bothered O
anyone. O

A O
huge O
plus, O
that O
alcohol O
can O
be O
brought O
with O
you, O
there O
is O
no O
traffic B-TARGET
jams. I-TARGET

In O
general, O
everyone O
was O
very O
pleased, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
wonderful O
holiday, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
to O
you O
again!!! O

I O
accidentally O
went O
to O
this O
place O
with O
my O
friends. O

made O
an O
order. O

We O
were O
sitting O
on O
the O
street, O
a O
banquet O
was O
held O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
at O
this O
time. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
pledge. O

Fifteen O
minutes O
later, O
neither O
the O
waiter O
nor O
the B-TARGET
waiter. I-TARGET

They O
went O
by O
themselves, O
picked O
up O
the O
clothes. O

The O
tea O
was O
delivered O
10 O
minutes O
after O
ordering. O

Then, O
20 O
minutes O
later, O
they O
brought O
1 O
salad. O

Another O
20 O
minutes O
passed O
brought O
1 O
hot O
(order O
was O
made O
for O
6 O
people). O

And O
so O
all O
night O
(one O
of O
my O
friends O
ate, O
and O
someone O
was O
just O
waiting) O
- O
in O
general, O
I O
got O
my O
dish O
1 O
hour O
and O
40 O
minutes O
after O
ordering O
(greens O
cooked O
on O
coals O
could O
be O
cooked O
faster) O
and O
after O
3 O
trips O
of O
my O
husband O
to O
the O
waitress. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
stated O
in O
the O
menu O
clearly O
do O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
actual O
size O
- O
such O
a O
portion O
and O
the O
child O
will O
not O
be O
fed! O

I O
do O
not O
advise O
anyone! O

Celebrate O
a O
friend’s O
wedding. O

We O
arrived O
in O
the O
evening, O
it O
was O
raining O
and O
that O
was O
the O
only O
disadvantage O
of O
the O
evening. O

What O
immediately O
pleasantly O
surprised O
the O
waitresses!!!-all B-TARGET
as O
a O
selection O
smiles O
completely O
sincere O
and O
benevolent, O
and O
not O
in O
order O
to O
get O
a O
cupcake O
(also O
what O
a O
cupcake O
is O
a O
banquet), O
meet, O
accompany, O
and O
during O
the O
whole O
holiday O
unobtrusively O
"like O
invisible" O
changed O
dishes, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
when O
it O
was O
necessary O
- O
they O
immediately O
appeared) O

Thank O
you O
very O
much, O
I O
haven't O
seen O
such O
a O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
long O
time! O

I O
couldn’t O
see O
the O
menu, O
so O
I O
don’t O
know O
the O
names, O
the O
prices O
too. O

I O
very O
much O
liked O
the O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
leaves, I-TARGET
the O
roulette B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
(the O
filling B-TARGET
included O
nuts, B-TARGET
the O
rest O
I O
didn't O
understand))), O
the O
cold B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
roulette I-TARGET
and, O
the O
strawberry, O
chewed O
with O
rice B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
- O
really O
a O
beautiful O
and O
delicious O
dish. B-TARGET

The O
pork B-TARGET
was O
not O
roasted. O

Separately O
I O
want O
to O
note O
the O
interior B-TARGET
- O
especially O
on O
the O
outside O
- O
cladding, O
pavilions, O
"happy" O
figures...in O
general, O
the O
photos O
were O
colourful) O

I O
already O
recommended O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
all O
my O
friends. O

Not O
only O
the O
young O
people O
liked O
it, O
but O
the O
older O
people O
too. O

I O
will O
note O
that O
it O
was O
chosen O
by O
the O
parents O
of O
our O
bridegroom, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
the O
review O
of O
Natalia O
A. O
- O
the O
review O
of O
the O
mother O
of O
our O
friend, O
so O
don't O
be O
so O
skeptical, O
people O
have O
long O
chosen O
this O
institution O
and O
wrote O
a O
sincere O
review, O
though O
little-worded, O
but O
honestly O
and O
without O
pathos))) O

Yesterday O
I O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
really O
very O
nice, O
everyone O
tells, O
shows, O
smiles, O
opens O
the O
doors. O

We O
were O
not O
offered O
to O
go O
up O
to O
the O
second O
floor, O
there O
they O
smoked. O

As O
I O
understand, O
all O
the O
best O
places O
are O
always O
for O
smokers, O
unfortunately. O

On O
the O
first O
floor O
is O
an O
open O
kitchen, O
everything O
is O
paved O
with O
tiles O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
tables O
- O
not O
very O
cozy, O
but O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
really O
interesting, O
at O
least O
something O
original O
for O
such O
a O
format. O

From O
the O
food O
on O
a O
hint O
from O
the O
previous O
review O
took O
a O
saverma B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
(270 O
p) O
- O
no O
enthusiasm, O
too O
much O
test B-TARGET
and O
somehow O
fresh, O
the O
fried B-TARGET
potato I-TARGET
liked O
her O
more O
than O
the O
saverma O
itself. O

I O
also O
tried O
the O
shrimp B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
(360 O
p), O
she O
liked O
it. O

The B-TARGET
portion I-TARGET
could O
be O
larger, O
of O
course, O
but O
this O
is O
ideal. O

A O
little O
strange O
crisp O
something O
adorned O
the O
dish O
from O
above, O
there O
was O
no O
taste, O
and O
I O
never O
understood O
what O
it O
was O
and O
why O
it O
was O
placed.) O

I O
drank O
milk O
ulun O
(180 O
p) O
about O
it O
nothing O
to O
say, O
except O
that O
it O
was O
prepared O
for O
20-25 O
minutes O
approximately, O
like O
a O
mineral. O

Food O
was O
brought, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
drinks, O
I O
had O
to O
gently O
remind O
and O
everything O
appeared. O

To O
go O
for O
lunch O
and O
escape O
- O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
center, O
if O
served O
faster) O

We O
held O
a O
celebration O
in O
March O
2014 O
at O
the O
restaurant O
"On O
the O
hill". O

We O
always O
communicated O
with O
the O
manager B-TARGET
Ekaterina, O
who O
answered O
all O
our O
questions, O
in O
many O
ways O
went O
to O
us O
for O
a O
meeting, O
and O
everything O
that O
was O
agreed O
was O
done. O

Thanks O
to O
her O
huge! O

Very O
pleased O
with O
service. B-TARGET

Two O
times O
visiting O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
food O
that O
was O
very O
delicious. O

At O
the O
banquet, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
very O
ordinary O
- O
everything O
was O
done O
well, O
but O
nothing O
memorable, O
in O
our O
view O
and O
in O
the O
view O
of O
many O
of O
the O
guests. O

Hot, B-TARGET
namely O
pork B-TARGET
and O
salmon, B-TARGET
are O
made O
very O
well, O
everything O
is O
soft O
and O
juicy. O

The O
next O
day O
after O
the O
celebration, O
we O
remembered O
that O
there O
were O
no O
fruits O
on O
the O
tables, O
although O
they O
were O
included O
in O
the O
contract O
and, O
accordingly, O
paid. O

So, O
dear O
visitors, O
make O
sure O
that O
everything O
ordered O
is O
brought O
to O
you. O

Children O
during O
the O
banquet O
can O
be O
fed O
on O
a O
special O
children's O
menu, O
however, O
on O
that O
day O
the O
cook B-TARGET
thought O
(according O
to O
the O
waitress) O
that O
to O
bring O
the O
ordered O
children's O
food O
only O
to O
the O
main O
dish O
of O
all O
guests O
(and O
this O
is O
about O
two O
hours O
after O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
event). O

The O
fact O
that O
children O
sit O
hungry O
and O
look O
at O
the O
sides O
for O
several O
hours O
- O
is O
it O
normal O
for O
them? O

After O
contacting O
the O
manager, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
immediately O
prepared O
and O
delivered. O

Please O
clarify O
this O
with O
the O
waitress. O

Decided O
to O
go O
somewhere O
to O
rest O
with O
the O
girls, O
I O
found O
a O
cozy O
grand B-TARGET
café I-TARGET
21 I-TARGET
Versta I-TARGET
on O
the O
Internet. O

Called O
to O
order O
a O
table, O
replied O
a O
nice O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
Evgeny, O
booked O
us O
a O
table O
taking O
into O
account O
all O
our O
wishes, O
for O
which O
he O
a O
separate O
huge O
thank O
you!!!!!! O

Arriving O
at O
the O
cafe O
at O
the O
appointed O
time, O
a O
nice O
young B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
met O
us O
and O
led O
us O
to O
the O
table. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
wonderful O
girl B-TARGET
who O
courteously O
and O
patiently O
answered O
all O
our O
questions. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
huge, O
thank O
you O
very O
much!!! O

Service B-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

We O
liked O
absolutely O
everything: O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
reigning O
in O
the O
cafe, O
not O
a O
minute O
did O
not O
regret O
coming O
here. O

I O
will O
recommend O
it O
to O
my O
friends O
and O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
again. O

The O
kids!!!! O

So O
keep O
it!! O

P O
is O

S O
is O

Thanks O
for O
the O
song B-TARGET
😉 O

The O
impression O
of O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
left O
not O
the O
best!! O

A O
new O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
city O
centre! O

First, O
no O
one O
welcomes O
the O
guests O
and O
does O
not O
accompany O
them O
to O
the O
table, O
let O
alone O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
room O
for O
smokers O
or O
non-smokers O
was O
not O
offered O
at O
all!! O

My O
friend O
ordered O
a O
business O
lunch, O
and O
I O
never O
saw O
the O
menu, O
because O
they O
just O
didn’t O
bring O
it!!! O

The O
order O
was O
terribly O
accepted, O
following O
the O
departing O
waitress B-TARGET
we O
agreed O
our O
order!!! O

I O
ordered O
tea, O
but O
I O
even O
brought O
it O
without O
jasmine!!))) O

The O
bread O
was O
not O
offered, O
in O
principle O
nothing O
was O
offered!!! O

With O
this O
service, B-TARGET
there O
will O
probably O
not O
be O
regular O
guests O
at O
the O
establishment!! O

Further... O
worse... O
the O
account O
we O
took O
out, O
when O
we O
were O
still O
eating, O
and O
not O
even O
asked O
for O
it, O
apparently O
in O
this O
establishment O
do O
not O
like O
when O
guests O
are O
delayed, O
there O
was O
the O
impression O
that O
we O
are O
definitely O
time!!!=))) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
cute, O
there O
are O
sofas, B-TARGET
really O
not O
very O
soft!! O

Previous O
reviews O
in O
one O
way O
or O
another O
fully O
describe O
this O
institution, O
but O
separately O
I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out: O
1. O

It O
was O
us, O
last O
Friday, O
frankly O
not O
lucky: O
there O
were O
4 O
girls B-TARGET
working, O
two O
of O
them O
clearly O
"swimming" O
- O
the O
wine O
brought O
after O
almost O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting, O
after O
a O
few O
kind O
reminders, O
not O
cooled O
and O
quite O
different O
than O
it O
was O
ordered O
("not O
found") O
- O
the O
food O
was O
waiting O
very O
long, O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
despite O
anything, O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
delicious, O
although O
the O
portions B-TARGET
could O
be O
even O
more O
(especially O
the O
garment). B-TARGET

They O
went O
on O
coupons, O
as O
a O
result O
for O
two O
people O
with O
2 O
bottles O
of O
table O
wine O
- O
only O
3000 O
rubles. O

The O
housewife B-TARGET
really O
sings O
great. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
birthday O
with O
a O
company O
of O
8 O
people. O

Overall O
I O
liked O
it. O

By O
menu: B-TARGET
Price O
above O
average O
A O
small O
selection O
of O
salads B-TARGET
From O
the O
company's O
dishes O
tried: O
salsa, O
pockets O
with O
fungi O
and O
fish, O
fried O
camembert, O
pork O
shishel, O
pork O
with O
mozzarella O
and O
mushrooms, O
acrylic. O

Everyone O
liked O
the O
portions. B-TARGET

A O
few O
slow O
waitresses. B-TARGET

The O
dishes O
were O
carried O
long O
and O
unevenly O
(half O
of O
the O
people O
were O
already O
sitting O
with O
empty O
plates, O
and O
the O
other O
did O
not O
even O
get O
snacks). O

Especially O
for O
a O
long O
time O
with O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
(and O
they O
proved O
to O
be O
very O
delicious). O

It O
had O
to O
be O
counted O
on O
the O
bench, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
never O
brought O
the O
bill. O

In O
principle, O
the O
celebration O
succeeded O
and O
the O
shortcomings O
did O
not O
ruin O
the O
overall O
impression. O

I O
had O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend O
recently. O

I O
watched O
the O
car O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
finally O
decided. O

We O
were O
met O
by O
tired O
but O
friendly O
girls O
and O
immediately O
led O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window O
is O
above O
all O
praise. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
remembered. O

Here O
at O
all. O

I O
just O
remember O
that O
dining O
utensils, O
glasses O
and O
spices O
are O
along O
the O
wall O
on O
a O
low O
staircase. O

Children O
are O
running O
by. O

And O
to O
these O
instruments O
stretch O
like O
to O
favorite O
toys. O

Nothing O
terrible, O
even O
funny, O
but O
her O
devices, O
for O
the O
case, O
wiped O
out O
with O
a O
towel. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
seemed O
a O
little O
boring, O
but O
we O
quickly O
made O
a O
choice. O

My O
friend O
ate O
a O
tomato O
soup O
and O
a O
marble O
beef O
steak O
with O
fresh O
tomatoes, O
and O
I O
did O
the O
same O
grilling O
vegetable O
steak. O

What O
can O
I O
say... O

The O
meat B-TARGET
was O
roasted O
slightly O
stronger O
than O
I O
ordered, O
but, O
nevertheless, O
tasty O
and O
delicate. O

For O
dessert O
tried O
chocolate O
cakes O
with O
hot O
chocolate O
inside O
and O
ice O
cream. O

That O
was O
really O
incredibly O
tasty. O

I O
recommend O
trying O
them O
to O
everyone! O

Service B-TARGET
was O
not O
impressive. O

Here O
is O
honest. O

Cinderella O
was O
very O
rarely O
changed, O
dirty O
dishes O
were O
not O
noticed O
for O
10 O
minutes, O
and O
this O
is O
because O
they O
ran O
past O
the O
table O
not O
once O
or O
two. O

But O
during O
the O
direct O
conversation, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
kind O
and O
friendly, O
which O
smoothed O
the O
negative O
impression. O

All O
in O
all, O
it O
was O
very O
cute. O

Did O
I O
like O
it? O

Rather O
yes O
than O
not. O

Will O
I O
go O
back O
there? O

Probably O
not O
what. O

Today O
we O
celebrated O
our O
birthday O
with O
a O
small O
company O
of O
six O
people. O

We O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
VIP O
room. O

I O
liked O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
of O
the O
table, O
a B-TARGET
candlestick I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
burning I-TARGET
candles I-TARGET
created O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
family O
celebration. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
great: O
the O
plates O
were O
cleaned O
immediately, O
new O
dishes O
were O
brought O
quickly, O
so O
nothing O
had O
to O
be O
expected. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
also O
pleasantly O
surprised, O
especially O
the O
size O
of O
portions. B-TARGET

Everything O
was O
fresh O
and O
delicious. O

The O
only O
“but” O
is O
the O
absence O
of O
live O
music, O
with O
it O
our O
evening O
would O
be O
even O
more O
pleasant. O

For O
relatively O
little O
money, O
we O
had O
a O
good O
rest O
and O
a O
good O
meal. O

Next O
time O
I O
won’t O
think O
about O
where O
to O
go O
to O
celebrate. O

I O
recently O
visited O
this O
restaurant, O
I O
agree O
with O
many O
that O
the O
main B-TARGET
hall I-TARGET
is O
tight, O
but O
I O
liked O
that O
there O
is O
a O
children's B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
when O
a O
babysitter O
was O
sitting O
with O
the O
child O
while O
we O
ate O
dinner, O
plus O
that O
there O
is O
a O
free O
children's B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
for O
children. O

Yes, O
the O
music B-TARGET
played O
loud, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
I O
liked O
that O
it O
was O
national O
and O
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

Served O
a O
very O
nice O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
constantly O
smiling O
and O
advising O
us O
good O
food. B-TARGET

The O
cuisine O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
Greek O
(I O
visit O
Greece O
almost O
every O
summer). O

Delicious O
salad B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
selection O
of O
salads, B-TARGET
a O
fairly O
large O
selection O
of O
alcohol. B-TARGET

Plus O
the O
price O
is O
not O
high O
for O
the O
city O
center. O

I O
think O
we’ll O
go O
back O
with O
family O
again. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
today. O

I O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
see O
for O
myself. O

The O
impressions O
remained O
very O
good. O

We O
were O
welcomed, O
showed O
the O
halls, O
and O
eventually O
we O
chose O
a O
table O
on O
the O
veranda. O

The O
people O
were O
few, O
the O
environment B-TARGET
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
available O
for O
long O
sittings. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
simple, O
but O
in O
Georgian O
style, O
pleasant O
music B-TARGET
plays. O

I O
don’t O
want O
to O
leave O
quickly... O

We O
were O
very O
lucky O
with O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
very O
kindly O
and O
quickly. O

Seeing O
some O
of O
our O
difficulties, O
he O
told O
us O
very O
detailed O
about O
the O
dishes, O
gave O
his O
recommendations O
regarding O
the O
choice O
of O
dishes. O

The O
order O
was O
executed O
very O
quickly, O
waiting O
no O
more O
than O
15 O
minutes. O

What O
can O
be O
said O
about O
the O
kitchen... O
hot B-TARGET
very I-TARGET
pleased, I-TARGET
especially O
deliciously O
cooked O
meat B-TARGET
- O
gentle O
juicy, O
deliciously O
cooked O
vegetables. B-TARGET

The O
salmon B-TARGET
shale I-TARGET
in O
the O
portion O
was O
obviously O
small, O
and O
there O
was O
virtually O
no O
vegetable. O

Not O
especially O
engaged. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
was O
cooked O
with O
too O
spicy O
sauce. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
expensive, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
do O
beer O
and O
pretty O
delicious O
homemade B-TARGET
morse. I-TARGET

The O
choice O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
is O
quite O
wide, O
so O
I O
think O
we O
will O
try O
something O
else O
next O
time. O

Yesterday O
I O
visited O
you O
for O
the O
first O
time O
at O
Command O
2 O

Very O
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
attention O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
above O
all O
praise! O
(special O
thanks O
to O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Evgeny, O
serving O
our O
table). O

For O
a O
long O
time O
we O
have O
been O
always O
at O
another O
Italian O
restaurant, O
now O
our O
hearts O
(and O
stomachs))) O
belong O
to O
Capone!!! B-TARGET

It O
was O
a O
bit O
risky O
for O
us O
to O
come O
to O
you O
yesterday O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
as O
a O
dinner O
was O
planned O
in O
honor O
of O
my O
DR. O

But O
we O
stayed O
in O
full O
enthusiasm, O
and O
already O
this O
morning, O
calling O
friends O
all O
strongly O
recommended O
to O
come O
to O
you!!! O

For O
a O
long O
time, O
I O
have O
treated O
my O
birthday O
more O
than O
calmly, O
limiting O
myself O
to O
a O
quiet O
family O
dinner. O

But O
yesterday... O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
many O
years O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
holiday O
returned, O
like O
from O
childhood! O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
it!! O

I O
want O
to O
emphasize O
the O
quality O
of O
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

They O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised! O

And O
of O
course O
our O
compliments O
to O
the O
cook!!! B-TARGET

And O
the O
taste O
and O
design O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
deserve O
the O
highest O
appreciation!!! O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
to O
you O
on O
all O
occasions, O
and O
without O
those, O
and O
of O
course O
we O
will O
recommend O
your O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
all O
our O
friends! O

Thank O
you O
again O
for O
a O
wonderful O
evening!! O

Yesterday O
we O
went O
to O
the O
wedding O
to O
a O
friend, O
celebrated O
in O
the O
restaurant O
"Valley". O

The O
evening O
was O
really O
great!! O

The O
tables B-TARGET
were O
very O
beautiful O
and O
decorated. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
interior... B-TARGET

Very O
comfortable O
and O
beautiful, O
and O
not O
ordinary. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
great O
and O
we O
had O
a O
great O
fun!! O

And O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters O
liked, O
because O
they O
were O
not O
obsessive O
and O
not O
noticeable, O
but O
despite O
this, O
the O
glasses O
were O
always O
full, O
the O
dishes O
were O
cleaned O
in O
time. O

Good O
guys O
guys O
:) O

I O
really O
liked O
it O
and O
would O
love O
to O
spend O
the O
evening O
there. O

The O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
great!! O

Not O
even O
lazy O
to O
go O
to O
the O
site O
and O
leave O
your O
feedback. O
)) O

I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
in O
this O
institution O
my O
DR O
in O
the O
company O
of O
friends. O

I O
have O
visited O
it O
a O
few O
times O
before O
and O
have O
had O
good O
impressions. O

Friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
good O
selection O
of O
beer, B-TARGET
quick O
order B-TARGET
execution. I-TARGET

It O
was O
also O
pleased O
to O
have O
their O
beer B-TARGET
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
good O
taste. O

The O
table O
was O
ordered O
in O
advance O
on O
Monday. O

However, O
on O
Friday, O
when O
I O
came O
directly O
to O
mark O
and O
decided O
to O
order O
their O
beer, O
I O
was O
told O
that O
there O
was O
only O
one O
sort O
left, O
and O
not O
a O
local O
beer. B-TARGET

I O
was O
upset, O
but O
not O
to O
cancel O
everything, O
the O
more O
invited O
began O
to O
approach O
a O
little O
bit... O

Within O
half O
an O
hour O
we O
got O
our O
beer. O

The O
next O
time O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
managed O
to O
summon O
when O
the O
glasses O
had O
been O
empty O
for O
10 O
minutes. O

I O
ordered O
more O
beer O
so O
I O
couldn’t O
wait. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
brought O
a O
glass O
and O
said O
there O
was O
no O
more O
beer!!! B-TARGET

I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
this O
building B-TARGET
anymore. O

Thank O
God O
there O
are O
other O
places O
in O
our O
city O
where O
the O
beer O
doesn’t O
end O
in O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
service O
staff O
doesn’t O
forget O
about O
your O
table O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

So O
the O
evening O
managed O
to O
save, O
and O
a O
heavy O
unpleasant O
precipitation O
remained O
from O
the O
Globe. B-TARGET

I O
have O
been O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
once. O

We O
came O
in O
the O
evening O
to O
listen O
to O
live O
music, O
relax O
and O
talk. O

Order O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

Everyone O
remained O
satisfied. O

On O
the O
first O
floor O
a O
cafe, O
and O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
3 O
rooms. O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
estimate O
everything O
at O
once, O
but O
what O
was O
ordered O
matched O
its O
taste O
and O
my O
taste O
(ordered O
Philadelphia B-TARGET
rolls, O
Greek B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and O
beer). B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
varied O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
good. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

There O
are O
tables B-TARGET
for O
every O
taste O
and O
with O
sofas O
and O
at O
the O
window O
and O
opposite O
the O
stage. O

Very O
good O
music, B-TARGET
the O
Egeiro O
Project O
performed O
that O
evening O
(thanks O
separately). O

P O
is O

S O
is O

A O
pleasant O
place B-TARGET
for O
evening O
rest. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
again. O
/> O

We O
had O
a O
wonderful O
evening O
in O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

Crazy O
likes O
the O
interior B-TARGET
with O
its O
refined O
simplicity O
- O
cozy O
and O
warm. O

It O
is O
very O
pleasant O
the O
friendly O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

A O
special O
thanks O
for O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
our O
waitress B-TARGET
(unfortunately, O
I O
don't O
know O
the O
name) O
- O
I O
knew O
the O
menu O
well, O
unobtrusively O
helped O
to O
decide O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
dishes. O

Everything O
I O
ordered O
was O
eaten O
with O
great O
pleasure. O

Pampelon B-TARGET
salad O
was O
very O
liked O
- O
spinach B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
blue I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
under O
a O
fantastic O
gasoline B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
"something O
with O
something"! O

Crazy O
delicious O
were O
cream B-TARGET
soups I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
lentils I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
foxes. I-TARGET

Until O
the O
dessert O
I O
did O
not O
do O
- O
so O
filled O
with O
salad B-TARGET
and O
soup B-TARGET
that O
I O
could O
not O
even O
try O
a O
piece. O

But O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
that O
the O
friends O
ordered O
looked O
very O
appetizing, O
and O
by O
their O
enthusiastic O
outcry, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
their O
expectations O
were O
met. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
time O
in O
a O
cozy, O
disposable, O
friendly O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
have O
a O
delicious O
meal, O
then O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
exactly O
what O
you O
need O
;) O

We O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
friends. O

The O
impression O
is O
not O
the O
best. O

First, O
the O
menu O
waited O
for O
15 O
minutes O
(although O
the O
people O
were O
not O
very O
many), O
then O
another O
15 O
minutes O
to O
make O
an O
order, O
prices O
are O
slightly O
higher O
than O
the O
city O
average, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
quality O
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
portions O
are O
small, O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
in O
general O
rubber, O
for O
all O
the O
time O
the O
ashes O
have O
not O
been O
changed. O

A O
place O
for O
evening O
rest. O

The B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
large O
enough, O
there O
is O
a O
non-smoking B-TARGET
area I-TARGET
and O
a O
children's B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
(and O
it O
is O
located O
behind O
the O
glass O
next O
to O
the O
non-smoking O
area, O
very O
convenient O
to O
observe O
children). O

Around O
the O
window O
there O
are O
tables O
for O
two O
with O
fun O
woven B-TARGET
hamacks I-TARGET
instead O
of O
chairs. O

There O
is O
a O
small O
dance B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
next O
to O
the O
fountain O
(play O
a O
good O
house B-TARGET
there, O
by O
the O
way), O
a O
lot O
of O
plasma B-TARGET
panels, I-TARGET
expanded O
sofas, B-TARGET
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
people O
have O
tried O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
used O
everywhere O
is O
inexpensive, O
but O
the O
space B-TARGET
itself O
looks O
cozy O
and O
festive. O

The B-TARGET
wardrobe I-TARGET
is O
also O
present. O

The B-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
did O
not O
make O
a O
special O
impression, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small, O
but O
for O
the O
bar O
will O
come O
down, O
although O
the O
prices O
seemed O
somewhat O
overpriced. O

I O
was O
upset O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
midias B-TARGET
and O
some O
overdried O
cakes, B-TARGET
which O
were O
cooked O
for O
quite O
a O
long O
time. O

My O
friend O
ordered O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
said O
it O
was O
delicious. O

A O
small O
selection O
of O
beer B-TARGET
(but O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
great), O
in O
general O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
choice O
of O
alcohol B-TARGET
for O
the O
bar O
was O
small. O

Cocktails B-TARGET
are O
very O
beautiful, O
and O
the O
photo O
is O
in O
the O
menu, O
you O
immediately O
see O
what O
you O
order, O
very O
convenient. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
pleased, O
because O
in O
a O
rather O
crowded O
room, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
did O
not O
wait, O
occasionally O
appeared O
to O
bar O
the O
dishes O
and O
ask O
if O
you O
need O
something. O

Overall, O
I O
liked O
it, O
put O
a O
slice. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
you O
for O
the O
unexpectedly O
pleasant O
impression O
made O
on O
me O
by O
the O
staff B-TARGET
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
your O
restaurant! B-TARGET

We O
arrived O
by O
company O
14.02, O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
on O
the O
phone O
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
polite, O
when O
we O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
we O
were O
immediately O
met O
and O
taken O
to O
the O
desired O
table O
on O
the O
terrace O
with O
views O
of O
the O
shore, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
- O
a O
young O
man, O
she O
did O
not O
force O
herself O
to O
wait O
long O
and O
was O
perfectly O
oriented O
in O
the O
menu, O
helped O
us O
choose O
the O
desired O
dishes. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant, O
there O
was O
a O
jazz O
evening, O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
pleasant! O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
again, O
it O
will O
be O
nice O
if O
we O
get O
a O
regular O
guest O
card! O
:-) O

I O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
on O
the O
weekend O
by O
chance. O

I O
was O
consulted O
by O
my O
sister, O
who O
is O
there O
often. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
quite O
cozy, O
nice O
home O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

There O
were O
few O
people, O
so O
we O
got O
a O
table O
at O
the O
window O
with O
a O
view O
on O
the O
Great O
Prospect. O

Not O
very O
bad. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
but O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
not O
large. O

We O
were O
four O
and O
we O
all O
ordered O
pasta. O

Everyone O
was O
well O
prepared. O

The O
salads B-TARGET
were O
really O
delicious. O

I O
took O
a O
paste O
with O
mushrooms. O

M O
is O
M. O

is O
delicious. O

One O
disadvantage O
that O
served O
us O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time. O

At O
our O
comment, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
said O
they O
had O
some O
problems O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

We O
didn’t O
start O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
the O
problems O
were, O
but O
the O
mood O
was O
broken. O

Prices O
are O
average. O

Yes, O
and O
in O
the O
restaurant O
the O
teas O
from O
the O
sum O
leave O
for O
themselves. O

It O
is O
not O
bad. O

You O
can O
also O
buy O
olive O
oil O
at O
home. O

very O
delicious. O

I O
wish O
you O
a O
pleasant O
time. O

So O
I O
will O
start O
from O
the O
end. O

I O
liked O
everything!! O

Probably, O
I O
am O
a O
conservative, O
because O
I O
love O
institutions O
like O
this O
plan: O
a O
good O
interior, B-TARGET
noisy O
music, B-TARGET
a O
calm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
polite O
and O
polite O
staff. B-TARGET

I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
not O
far O
from O
home. O

I O
have O
long O
chosen O
a O
place. O

To O
walk, O
place O
the O
child O
in O
the O
child's O
room, O
well, O
and O
according O
to O
the O
reviews, O
it O
would O
be O
more O
or O
less. O

The O
choice O
fell O
on O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
hall O
was O
half O
empty, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
herself O
offered O
a O
place O
in O
the O
corner O
for O
us O
(I, O
husband O
and O
son O
6 O
years O
old). O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
I O
ordered O
liked O
everyone O
without O
exception. O

The O
wife O
liked O
cooked O
vegetables, B-TARGET
salads B-TARGET
"Caesar" I-TARGET
too O
for O
fame, O
salmon B-TARGET
- O
no O
questions, O
etc. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
watched O
the O
table O
and O
in O
time O
changed O
the O
ashes O
and O
added O
wine, O
i.e. O

Service B-TARGET
as O
it O
should O
be O
- O
in O
the O
classic O
style. O

I O
sat O
down, O
thinking... O

I O
don’t O
know O
what O
shortcomings O
to O
find. O

Everything O
is O
great. O

I O
was O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
not O
the O
last O
time! O

They O
celebrated O
the O
son’s O
wedding O
in O
the O
banquet O
hall O
in O
July O
2013. O

The O
hall B-TARGET
is O
wonderful. O

But... O

We O
selected O
the O
average O
in O
the O
price O
category O
menu. B-TARGET

When O
I O
arrived, O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
a O
small O
snack. B-TARGET

I O
thought O
there O
should O
be O
more. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
hit O
with O
dried O
cheese. B-TARGET

The O
fruits B-TARGET
were O
at O
the O
last O
breath. O

When O
I O
tried O
the O
salad, B-TARGET
I O
was O
terrified. O

The O
quality O
is O
drawn O
to O
the O
competition, O
not O
to O
the O
banquet O
hall. O

Before O
ordering O
a O
banquet, O
I O
ordered O
something O
at O
the O
café O
on O
the O
first O
floor. O

The O
food B-TARGET
liked. O

But O
it O
feels O
like O
someone O
else O
is O
preparing O
for O
the O
banquet. O

I O
didn’t O
like O
the O
heat B-TARGET
either. O

The O
cake O
was O
ours. O

The O
wedding, O
of O
course, O
was O
fun, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
did O
not O
decorate O
her. O

When O
the O
young O
people O
left, O
the O
guests O
broke O
up, O
and O
I O
asked O
to O
pack O
what O
was O
left O
for O
us. O

The O
administrator O
said O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
packed O
and O
collected, O
including O
alcohol O
and O
juices. O

To O
my O
surprise, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
told O
me O
that O
I O
could O
collect O
everything O
from O
the O
tables O
myself, O
they O
would O
give O
me O
containers O
for O
a O
separate O
fee. O

After O
thirty O
minutes O
of O
arguments, O
I O
managed O
to O
force O
them O
to O
put O
something O
together. O

The O
remaining O
alcohol, O
water O
and O
juices O
were O
collected O
by O
themselves. O

My O
second O
son O
is O
married O
this O
year. O

When O
he O
said O
that O
this O
room O
was O
already O
busy O
for O
the O
right O
date, O
I O
was O
delighted. O

My O
young O
man O
once O
ordered O
a O
table O
for O
March O
8. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
too. O

But O
the O
service... B-TARGET
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
aiming O
to O
start O
celebrating O
the O
8th O
of O
March O
sooner O
(we O
arrived O
there O
around O
21.30, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance O
said O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
open O
until O
23.00, O
although O
YES, O
when O
the O
table O
was O
booked, O
NO O
ONE O
ADVARED O
us O
that O
the O
restaurant O
will O
work O
until O
23.00) O

The O
order O
was O
brought O
pretty O
quickly, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
started O
to O
eat, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
hamsky O
asked O
us O
to O
move O
to O
another O
table. O

I O
naturally O
refused. O

The O
mood O
was O
not O
ruined O
(it O
was O
just O
unpleasant), O
but O
we O
did O
not O
leave O
the O
teas. B-TARGET

Your O
restaurant, O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone. O

Good O
day! O

I O
was O
with O
my O
friends O
at O
this O
cafe O
yesterday. O

very O
much O
liked! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
delicious O
meals!! B-TARGET

I O
ordered O
biscuits, B-TARGET
no O
words O
as O
delicious))) O

They O
prepare O
very O
quickly O
and O
most O
importantly O
quality, O
it O
immediately O
feels O
like O
there O
are O
masters O
of O
their O
business! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
good O
service, B-TARGET
the O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
hospitable O
waiters! B-TARGET

We O
hope O
to O
visit O
this O
wonderful, O
cozy O
place B-TARGET
with O
great O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
again. O

At O
first, O
I O
didn’t O
want O
to O
go O
in O
too O
bright O
and O
bright! O

At O
the O
entrance O
you O
get O
into O
a O
small O
cafe. O

At O
first O
I O
thought O
this O
was O
a O
cafe, O
but O
when O
I O
got O
up O
the O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
I O
was O
shocked O
by O
the O
number O
of O
people!! O

Really O
a O
lot O
of O
people!! O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
long O
time O
– O
provided O
that O
she O
was O
called O
by O
herself, O
and O
not O
once!! O

We O
ordered O
tobacco O
chicken, O
Greek O
salad O
and O
beer! O

I O
have O
a O
principle O
– O
in O
any O
new O
place O
for O
me O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
order O
a O
Greek O
salad: O
liked O
– O
you O
can O
have O
this O
place O
in O
mind, O
or O
vice O
versa. O

The O
beer O
was O
brought O
quickly..when O
the O
pile O
noticed O
that O
the O
glass O
below O
was O
dirty, O
like O
from O
kefir. O
thought:"well, O
it O
started!!" O
but O
then O
looked O
up O
and O
realized O
that O
it O
was O
such O
a O
glass O
with O
an O
indicator..how O
to O
say O
it..degrees, O
that O
is O
below O
0))))) O

The O
salad O
came O
quickly O
and O
I O
liked O
it!! O

I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
worse. O

Fresh O
vegetables O
chicken O
have O
been O
waiting O
for O
a O
long O
time...probably O
for O
half O
an O
hour. O

But O
it O
was O
worth O
it. O
well O
prepared, O
spice B-TARGET
in O
measure. O

Chicken B-TARGET
as O
needed. O

The O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
attached, O
but O
I O
didn’t O
like O
it...per O
because O
of O
the O
bread O
because O
I O
put O
it O
in O
the O
sauce. O

In O
general, O
the O
impressions O
remained O
nice O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
very O
nice O
and O
simple O
girl, B-TARGET
which O
of O
course O
can O
not O
be O
said O
about O
the O
administrators..but B-TARGET
yes O
God O
with O
them!! O

The O
DR O
decided O
to O
sign O
there. O

It O
was O
1 O
February. O

I O
am O
the O
second O
time, O
my O
friend O
is O
the O
first. O

We O
arrived O
late, O
at O
seven. O

The O
people O
were O
very O
few. O

I O
was O
delighted O
to O
find O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

At O
the O
entrance O
the O
girls B-TARGET
asked O
about O
our O
preferences O
and O
conducted O
to O
the O
second O
floor. O

Speaking O
in O
detail O
about O
all O
the O
charms O
of O
this O
establishment. O

I O
suggested O
choosing O
a O
table. O

Soft O
couches B-TARGET
with O
pillows. B-TARGET

Really O
pleasant O
silent O
music B-TARGET
and O
light O
semi-darkness. B-TARGET

We O
were O
served O
by O
two O
waiters. O

The O
second O
was O
pleasant O
and O
polite, O
and O
as O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
remember O
knew O
the O
components O
of O
all O
dishes. O

He O
also O
helped O
the O
companion O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
wine, B-TARGET
and O
me O
with O
a O
cocktail B-TARGET
drink, I-TARGET
and O
they O
are O
here O
for O
any O
taste O
and O
color, O
as O
they O
say. O

The O
medallions B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
were O
wonderful. O

Recently, O
I O
have O
completely O
moved O
away O
from O
fish O
and O
am O
glad O
when O
they O
serve O
well-cooked O
meat. B-TARGET

The O
order O
arrived O
quickly. O

Two O
people O
were O
constantly O
served B-TARGET
in O
the O
room, O
so O
they O
were O
on O
the O
call O
within O
a O
minute. O

We O
spent O
two O
hours O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
had O
a O
smile O
and O
a O
suggestion O
to O
come O
again, O
but O
this O
is O
a O
service! O

Overall, O
a O
great O
impression O
of O
this O
building. B-TARGET

Hopefully O
we O
will O
bring O
you O
a O
bigger O
company! O

In O
April, O
she O
celebrated O
her O
DR O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Everyone O
else O
was O
very O
pleased. O

We O
were O
lucky O
- O
at O
this O
time O
there O
were O
few O
visitors O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
so O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
( O
I O
think O
we O
were O
served O
by O
an O
administrator) B-TARGET
was O
provided O
only O
to O
us. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
service B-TARGET
- O
professional, O
non-obsessive, O
friendly. O

They O
helped O
with O
the O
choice, O
covered O
a O
table O
with O
cold O
snacks. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious! O

Shashilik B-TARGET
is O
above O
all O
praise. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy. O

The O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
perfect! O

The O
first O
months O
after O
the O
opening O
could O
simply O
not O
be O
pleased O
with O
such O
a O
classy O
place. B-TARGET

And O
it O
is O
fun O
to O
sit O
with O
friends O
and O
two O
with O
a O
young O
man. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
high. O

I O
was O
there O
three O
times O
a O
week. O

Now O
everything O
is O
ruined. O

People O
have O
always O
been O
terrible. O

Service B-TARGET
fell O
sharply. O

The O
last O
time O
we O
didn’t O
even O
clean O
the O
table O
after O
the O
previous O
visitors. O

Very O
often O
it O
is O
not O
what O
is O
in O
the O
menu B-TARGET
(although O
it O
was O
not O
before) O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
has O
deteriorated O
in O
my O
opinion. O

The O
prices O
remained O
at O
the O
previous O
level. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
no O
longer O
pleasant. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
institution O
on O
10 O
September O
2008, O
I O
went O
with O
my O
husband O
after O
work O
- O
found O
it O
hard, O
the O
name O
is O
good, O
but O
it O
is O
written O
so O
artistically O
that O
it O
just O
cannot O
be O
disassembled.) O

The O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
small O
cozy O
- O
but O
it O
is O
more O
a O
café O
than O
a O
restaurant. O

Two O
floors B-TARGET
- O
on O
the O
second O
much O
more O
cozy O
)) O
we O
were O
immediately O
met, O
divided, O
held O
and O
placed O
)) O

A O
huge O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
wardrobe-server-barman B-TARGET
in O
one O
person, O
a O
nice O
and O
friendly O
African B-TARGET
American.) I-TARGET

I O
tried O
various O
rolls, B-TARGET
cooked O
them O
very O
quickly O
for O
5-10 O
minutes, O
especially O
delicious O
baked O
and O
Philadelphia B-TARGET
would O
be O
good, O
but O
I O
didn't O
understand O
why O
the O
rolls B-TARGET
were O
where O
5, O
where O
6, O
and O
where O
7 O
))) O

The O
price O
in O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
a O
restaurant, O
although O
it O
may O
be O
because O
the O
rolls B-TARGET
are O
quite O
large. O

Overall O
I O
liked O
– O
a O
very O
large O
selection O
of O
sushi, B-TARGET
rolls, B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
soups B-TARGET
and O
other O
hot B-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

But O
I O
will O
not O
go O
here O
anymore, O
because O
there O
are O
places O
where O
sushi O
is O
cooked O
better O
and O
more O
thoroughly. O

I O
just O
came O
from O
this O
establishment. O

I O
want O
to O
tell O
others O
to O
keep O
in O
mind... O

The B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
cozy, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting O
and O
qualitatively O
made, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good. O

We O
came, O
at O
first O
everything O
was O
fine, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
brought O
the O
menu O
immediately, O
after O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
came O
to O
take O
the O
order, O
after O
5 O
minutes O
brought O
a O
beer, O
after O
another O
5 O
snacks, O
all O
the O
pleasant O
ended. O

Then O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
seemed O
to O
have O
disappeared, O
it O
was O
not O
to O
call O
to O
order O
something, O
it O
was O
very O
long O
to O
wait, O
in O
the O
end O
we O
calculated O
incorrectly, O
we O
paid O
2 O
points O
more O
than O
we O
ordered. O

And O
this O
waitress B-TARGET
instead, O
in O
order O
to O
politely O
figure O
it O
out, O
acted O
humbly, O
eventually O
brought O
a O
new O
bill, O
with O
the O
words, O
I O
don’t O
know... O
I O
don’t O
remember O
what O
you O
ordered, O
but O
be O
yours... O
in O
short, O
boosted O
the O
mood... O
so O
I’ll O
come O
to O
this O
institution B-TARGET
not O
soon O
again O

Honestly O
speaking, O
several O
times O
passing O
over O
Gorohova O
recently O
paid O
attention O
to O
a O
new O
restaurant, O
judging O
by O
the O
name O
of O
Georgian O
cuisine. O

Every O
time O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
in, O
but O
it O
didn’t O
work O
out. O

And O
finally, O
specifically O
scheduled O
a O
weekend O
visit O
to O
Saperawi. O

Interior: B-TARGET
Even O
from O
the O
street, O
the O
restaurant O
attracts O
with O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
dim B-TARGET
light. I-TARGET

Inside, O
the O
impression O
becomes O
even O
better. O

Brick O
walls, O
fine O
furniture, B-TARGET
modern O
interior... B-TARGET

All O
as O
I O
love. O

A O
dozen O
for O
my O
taste. O

Service: B-TARGET
welcomed, O
hanged O
clothes O
in O
the O
closet, O
spent O
at O
the O
table. O

It O
is O
OK... O

They O
served O
quickly O
and O
high O
quality, O
recommending O
a O
certain O
dish. O

I O
asked O
if O
I O
liked O
it. O

Generally O
pleasant O
and O
unobtrusive. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
trying O
and O
hopefully O
will O
continue O
to O
do O
so. O

Kitchen: O
Hachapuri B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
adjar I-TARGET
- O
a O
lot O
of O
cheese, B-TARGET
soft O
pasta... B-TARGET
great. O

Salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
- O
a O
large O
portion, B-TARGET
unusual O
filling, B-TARGET
quite O
liked. O

Salad O
from O
the O
chef B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
- O
nothing O
unusual, O
but O
delicious. O

Tiramisu B-TARGET
is O
above O
all O
praise. O

Very O
gentle O
cream, B-TARGET
good O
infusion. B-TARGET

In O
terms O
of O
price O
and O
quality, O
very O
much. O

It O
is O
good O
that O
open O
no O
matter O
what, O
restaurants B-TARGET
with O
quality O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

Yes, O
of O
course, O
because O
there O
are O
so O
many O
more O
left O
on O
the O
menu O
not O
tried. O

My O
friends O
have O
not O
fooled O
me. O

As O
it O
was O
said, O
“The O
most O
delicious O
sushi B-TARGET
in O
the O
city!” O

Place O
and O
interior: O
The O
restaurant O
is O
located O
in O
the O
bedroom B-TARGET
area, I-TARGET
I O
would O
not O
go O
to O
it, O
but O
it O
was O
on O
the O
way. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
clean, O
calm, O
comfortable. O

Kitchen: B-TARGET
beautiful O
sushi, B-TARGET
fresh O
fish, B-TARGET
properly O
cooked O
rice, B-TARGET
as O
baked, O
and O
classic B-TARGET
sushi I-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
are O
wonderful O
as O
good. O

All O
portions B-TARGET
of O
impressive O
size O
:) O

It O
is O
delicious. O

And O
also O
give O
a O
delicious O
snack B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cherries, I-TARGET
which O
is O
not O
bad O
either. O

Service: B-TARGET
fast, O
in O
the O
case, O
without O
mistakes. O

Prices O
are O
average, O
sushi O
from O
55 O
rubles, O
rolls B-TARGET
up O
to O
600, O
drinks B-TARGET
are O
not O
expensive. O

The O
overall O
impression O
is O
pleasant. O

If O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O
the O
area O
of O
Lenin O
Avenue, O
the O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
for O
lovers O
of O
Japanese O
cuisine. O

I O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
as O
a O
restaurant O
for O
lunch O
and O
dinner. O

The O
audience O
is O
different, O
and O
family O
couples O
and O
guys O
who O
came O
to O
lunch O
"in O
the O
area", O
girlfriends O
and O
mothers O
with O
children. O

Not O
sure O
about O
romantic O
dates. O

But O
come O
in O
and O
eat O
simply, O
without O
a O
reason-yes. O
I O
liked. O
-1 O
point O
for O
coffee, B-TARGET
it O
is O
not O
delicious. O

The O
overall O
impression O
is O
pleasant. O

Thanks O
for O
a O
delicious O
lunch! O

Hi O
to O
all! O

We O
from O
Moscow, O
visited O
for O
the O
weekend O
Peter O
and O
your O
wonderful O
restaurant! B-TARGET

I O
liked O
everything: O
and O
the O
unusually O
made O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
the O
good O
service B-TARGET
of O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
with O
the O
recommendation O
of O
dishes, O
the O
beautiful O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window, O
and O
most O
importantly O
the O
very O
good O
kitchen!!! B-TARGET

The O
price O
is O
completely O
in O
line O
with O
the O
quality, O
everything O
is O
very O
delicious, O
which O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
rare O
for O
Peter, O
where O
there O
are O
few O
really O
good O
restaurants. O

Next O
time O
we’ll O
be O
in O
Peter, O
we’ll O
be O
with O
you, O
thank O
you! O

On O
Friday O
the O
8th O
with O
friends O
passed O
by O
the O
restaurant O
and O
saw O
a O
large O
sign O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
see O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
Olympics. O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
simple O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
(thanks O
to O
the O
huge O
chef), O
the O
huge O
selection O
of O
snacks B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
beer. I-TARGET

Particularly O
liked O
" O
Halapena B-TARGET
peppers I-TARGET
" O
(it O
seemed O
to O
be O
called O
this O
dish), O
moderate O
prices, O
large O
portions. B-TARGET

There O
are O
a O
few O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
so O
delicious O
and O
so O
not O
expensive!!!! O

Pleasantly O
surprised O
the B-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

The O
girl B-TARGET
who O
served O
us, O
with O
a O
rare O
name O
Antonina, O
is O
well O
acquainted O
with O
the O
restaurant O
food O
and O
skillfully O
recommended O
us O
various O
snacks. O

What O
a O
beer! B-TARGET

There O
are O
about O
10 O
varieties O
for O
every O
taste. O

The O
bartender B-TARGET
was O
just O
a O
friend. O

On O
any O
question O
about O
beer, O
he O
skillfully O
picked O
up O
beer B-TARGET
for O
each O
of O
us. O

Everything O
was O
great O
at O
this O
beer B-TARGET
bar!!! I-TARGET

All O
of O
us O
are O
on O
the O
road!!!!! B-TARGET

Until O
recently, O
I O
regularly O
visited O
this O
institution O
with O
my O
colleagues. O

But O
lately, O
both O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
have O
deteriorated: O
the O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
so O
salt O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
eat O
them, O
the O
cake O
to O
the O
first O
dish O
was O
served O
after O
the O
first O
was O
eaten. O

I O
ordered O
a O
bullet O
today. O

Dish O
from O
the O
ordinary O
menu, O
without O
searches. O

After O
20 O
minutes O
of O
waiting, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
asked O
Love O
if O
the O
soup O
would O
be O
served O
soon. O

Answer O
in O
3-5 O
minutes. O

Another O
10 O
passed. O

They O
refused O
the O
soup O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
book O
of O
reviews. O

The O
book O
was O
brought O
quite O
quickly, O
and O
after O
5 O
minutes O
- O
soup, O
which O
was O
no O
longer O
desire O
to O
eat. O

Asked O
to O
approach O
us O
or O
the O
manager B-TARGET
or O
another O
administrator. B-TARGET

Five O
minutes O
later, O
a O
girl B-TARGET
came, O
who O
did O
not O
appear O
and O
asked O
about O
our O
claims. O

Our O
comment O
that O
we O
were O
forced O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
soup O
for O
about O
half O
an O
hour O
was O
followed O
not O
by O
an O
apology, O
but O
by O
the O
phrase O
that O
there O
were O
many O
customers. O

For O
a O
restaurant O
of O
this O
level, O
it O
is O
not O
permissible O
for O
the O
loosiness O
and O
inefficiency O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
to O
affect O
the O
overall O
impression O
of O
the O
institution. B-TARGET

Of O
all O
the O
restaurants O
of O
Chinese O
cuisine O
I O
visited, O
Tan B-TARGET
Zhen I-TARGET
on O
peanut O
is O
the O
most O
favorite. O

It’s O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
well, O
deliciously O
and O
simply. O

Here O
you O
will O
not O
have O
an O
expensive, O
luxurious O
interior O
and O
an O
exquisite O
menu. O

But O
you O
will O
get O
a O
great O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
fast, O
quality O
service. B-TARGET

From O
year O
to O
year, O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
not O
getting O
worse, O
which O
can O
not O
but O
rejoice. O

Despite O
the O
furious O
popularity, O
the O
owners O
keep O
the O
brand O
and O
do O
not O
allow O
themselves O
to O
save O
on O
the O
quality O
of O
food. B-TARGET

Moreover, O
even O
when O
the O
hall O
is O
full O
(which O
happens O
in O
99.9% O
of O
cases), O
you O
won’t O
wait O
for O
the O
menu O
or O
wait O
for O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
for O
more O
than O
2 O
minutes. O

A O
simple O
example: O
February O
14th, O
in O
full O
swing, O
from O
the O
moment O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
table O
to O
the O
moment O
we O
got O
our O
first O
dish, O
15 O
minutes O
passed. O

It O
was O
delicious. O

Not O
even O
so. O

It O
tastes. O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
you O
need O
to O
reserve O
a O
table. O

I O
have O
long O
thought O
about O
where O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O

The O
choice O
stopped O
at O
the O
Escalibur O
restaurant. O

And O
I O
was O
not O
wrong. O

I O
ordered O
a O
table, O
discussed O
all O
the O
nuances O
of O
the O
event. O

I O
visited O
this O
place B-TARGET
on O
May O
31 O
with O
my O
friends. O

Everyone O
was O
delighted! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
medieval O
castle, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
exceeded O
all O
expectations. O

Prices O
are O
acceptable, O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
original, O
tastefully O
decorated, O
and, O
most O
importantly, O
everything O
is O
very O
delicious, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
good. O

It O
was O
immediately O
apparent O
that O
all O
products B-TARGET
were O
fresh. O

In O
every O
dish B-TARGET
you O
notice O
the O
indifferent O
attitude O
of O
its O
author. O

Very O
pleased O
staff: B-TARGET
administrators B-TARGET
Elena, O
Marina, O
waitress B-TARGET
Nikolai. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
note O
the O
friendly, O
polite, O
attentive O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
non-obsessive O
service! B-TARGET

All O
my O
wishes O
regarding O
the O
organization O
and O
conduct O
of O
my O
holiday O
were O
taken O
into O
account, O
that O
is, O
I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
run O
and O
remind. O

We O
left O
full O
and O
satisfied O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
pleasant O
impressions! O

I O
will O
also O
note O
as O
a O
person O
interested O
in O
photography, O
that O
the O
photos O
on O
the O
background O
of O
this O
wonderful O
medieval O
interior B-TARGET
are O
just O
fantastic! O

Color, B-TARGET
light, B-TARGET
wall B-TARGET
design I-TARGET
- O
everything O
is O
very O
well O
combined. O

It O
still O
feels O
like O
we’re O
in O
a O
different O
time, O
in O
a O
different O
dimension. O

I O
advise O
everyone! O

The O
first O
time O
I O
visited O
this O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
friends O
two O
months O
ago. O

It O
impresses B-TARGET
everything! I-TARGET

Delicious O
beer B-TARGET
(especially O
barley O
:) O
and O
judgment B-TARGET
to O
it O
in O
the O
form O
of O
snacks O
:), O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
friendly O
staff! B-TARGET

A O
miniature O
girl B-TARGET
(in O
my O
opinion, O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
administrator) I-TARGET
is O
a O
high O
professional O
in O
her O
business: O
non-obsessive O
service, B-TARGET
friendly O
approach B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
visitors, I-TARGET
attentive O
attitude B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
customers. I-TARGET

Such O
a O
pleasant O
impression O
of O
the O
level O
of O
European O
service O
is O
rarely O
obtained O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Neva. O

Although O
such O
establishments O
are O
full O
in O
the O
city, O
and O
to O
visit O
not O
once O
you O
want O
only O
worthy O
places... O

Thank O
you O
very O
much!! O

I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
anniversary O
by O
inviting O
groups O
of O
friends O
in O
small O
companies. O

I O
took O
advantage O
of O
the O
promotion O
on O
myfant.ru O
Very O
pleased O
that O
I O
chose O
"Eastern B-TARGET
Express". I-TARGET

The O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
sit O
and O
chat O
in O
a O
cozy O
environment B-TARGET
for O
people O
not O
very O
young. O

All O
three O
times O
were O
sitting O
in O
the O
smoking O
room O
- O
very O
cute O
and O
comfortable O
couchets. B-TARGET

Good O
ventilation B-TARGET
and O
fewer O
people. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
were O
very O
pleasant O
to O
me O
and O
my O
guests. O

Thank O
you O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

I O
would O
love O
to O
go O
without O
action. O

Of O
the O
dishes O
she O
took, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
"Caucasian" I-TARGET
liked O
the O
most O
- O
gentle O
with O
the O
original O
grapefruit B-TARGET
acid. O

Salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
low-salted I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
was O
also O
good O
from O
a O
hot O
take O
Dorad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables. I-TARGET

Originally O
served O
vegetable B-TARGET
garnish. I-TARGET

Forel B-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
petry I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
a O
delicious, O
light O
and O
beautifully O
decorated O
dish. B-TARGET

I O
wanted O
to O
try O
Chevrolet. O

I O
took O
four O
portions O
(two O
large O
chebures) O

Tar O
tar O
sauce O
for O
them. O

Light O
thin O
paste, B-TARGET
juicy O
meat B-TARGET
is O
great. O

Morse O
- O
from B-TARGET
natural I-TARGET
strawberries, I-TARGET
like O
home. O

For O
dessert O
- O
took O
a O
cherry B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
(a O
lot O
of O
cherries B-TARGET
with O
a O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
ball), O
a O
hot O
apple B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
(also O
liked), O
a O
strawberry B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
- O
in O
my O
opinion, O
a O
pancotta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
strawberry I-TARGET
puree, I-TARGET
(sweet O
and O
tasty) O

Overall, O
we O
had O
a O
great O
time O
and O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal O
in O
this O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

There O
were O
not O
many O
people O
there O
on O
Saturday. O

Pleasant O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
(a O
little O
loud O
truth O
seemed). O

Ordered O
another O
day O
duck B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Beijing I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
(important!), O
in O
the O
evening O
the O
food. B-TARGET

The O
overall O
impression O
is O
a O
great O
place, B-TARGET
there O
are, O
of O
course, O
a O
few O
disadvantages: O
the O
tea O
was O
brought O
at O
the O
very O
beginning O
(the O
girl B-TARGET
was O
asked O
to O
stop O
performing O
the O
tea O
ceremony, O
but O
apparently O
she O
doesn't O
speak O
Russian O
at O
all O
:))), O
the O
portions B-TARGET
of O
the O
cognac O
are O
not O
as O
huge O
as O
it O
usually O
happens O
in O
Chinese O
restaurants O
(especially O
rice O
- O
such O
no O
more O
ever O
met:))), O
and O
the O
soup B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
pot O
has O
never O
been O
brought. O

And O
in O
the O
rest, O
everything O
is O
great: O
and O
the O
girl B-TARGET
administrator I-TARGET
(helped O
us O
to O
make O
a O
choice O
of O
dishes), O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
not O
smoked, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
fast, O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
attentive, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

In O
general, O
a O
decent O
Chinese B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
the O
food O
is O
of O
course O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
we O
say O
in O
"Harbin", O
but O
the O
restaurant O
is O
worth O
it. O

You O
can O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
visit O
next O
time. O

thank O
you. O

They O
first O
arrived O
in O
Araguaia O
in O
February. O

The O
company O
was O
large, O
the O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance. O

Everything O
really O
liked O
- O
and O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
and O
the O
service, B-TARGET
and O
the O
setting. B-TARGET
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
immediately O
became O
a O
favorite, O
so O
from O
time O
to O
time O
we O
look O
there. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
with O
a O
girlfriend O
on O
April O
16. O

I O
ordered O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

Despite O
the O
working O
day, O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
occupied, O
so O
the O
reservation O
proved O
very O
appropriate. O

Cooking O
in O
Araguaia O
is O
very O
delicious, O
waiting O
for O
food B-TARGET
does O
not O
take O
long. O

We O
ordered O
greens B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables, I-TARGET
so O
there O
brought O
this O
good O
whole O
basket.)) O

Somebody O
likes O
beef, O
somebody O
likes O
pork. O

Very O
delicious O
cheesecakes! B-TARGET

Desserts B-TARGET
are O
small, O
but O
also O
very O
delicious. O

We O
tried O
a O
light O
dessert O
and O
baked O
pears. O
it O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
there O
are O
no O
Georgian B-TARGET
wines... I-TARGET
but O
they O
are O
nowhere. O

The B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
silent, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
has O
to O
communicate. O

So O
if O
you O
need O
a O
quiet, O
pleasant O
place O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
deliciously O
and O
inexpensively, O
Aragvi B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
option! O

I O
read O
negative O
reviews O
about O
this O
restaurant, O
but O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
so O
found O
them O
exaggerated. O

I O
will O
tell O
you, O
now O
from O
my O
own O
experience, O
the O
service B-TARGET
as O
such O
is O
simply O
absent. O

The O
order O
was O
not O
accepted O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
three O
tables O
were O
occupied O
in O
the O
huge O
hall O
(!) O

Then O
we O
wait O
for O
drinks. O

One O
juice O
was O
brought, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
orange B-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
(!), O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
clarified O
which O
to O
replace O
and O
left. O

Wait O
for O
10-15 O
minutes O
to O
drink. O

Only O
after O
we O
approached O
the O
bar O
and O
reminded O
us O
of O
the O
juice O
brought. O

They O
brought O
food O
later. O

There O
were O
no O
towels O
or O
spices O
on O
the O
table, O
they O
just O
didn’t O
bring O
them. O

They O
made O
signs O
again. O

Food B-TARGET
did O
not O
like. O

Difference O
in O
price O
and O
quality. O

Everything O
is O
delicious, O
but O
not O
very O
delicious. O

I O
just O
liked O
coffee. B-TARGET

There O
were O
no O
cakes B-TARGET
in O
the O
menu. O

They O
left O
disappointed, O
lost O
1.5-2 O
hours, O
but O
did O
not O
get O
pleasure. O

I O
have O
long O
wanted O
to O
visit O
this O
restaurant, O
because O
I O
love O
Chinese O
cuisine, O
and O
my O
husband O
prefers O
Japanese. O

Apparently O
the O
ideal O
option. O

We O
gathered O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
arrived O
at O
night. O

Everybody O
was O
tired O
at O
11 O
p.m. O

The B-TARGET
waitress, I-TARGET
as O
if O
under O
light O
drugs O
listened O
not O
carefully O
and O
did O
not O
record O
anything, O
as O
a O
result, O
after O
25 O
minutes O
of O
waiting O
brought O
the O
wrong O
dish O
that O
was O
ordered. O

They O
refused. O

Time O
was O
later O
a O
lot O
to O
eat O
we O
couldn’t O
but O
saying O
3 O
dishes O
of O
Chinese B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
and O
2 O
Japanese O
we O
didn’t O
find O
one O
really O
delicious. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
pretentious O
and O
not O
delicious. O

In O
addition, O
the O
account O
has O
already O
included O
tea O
fees, O
and O
this O
is O
10%, O
for O
such O
a O
service B-TARGET
I O
did O
not O
give O
2 O
x. O

Only O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
positive. O

Not O
very O
comfortable O
furniture. B-TARGET

We O
will O
no O
longer O
go O
to O
this O
building. B-TARGET

We O
liked O
absolutely O
everything!! O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Excellent O
banquet B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
good O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
very O
democratic O
prices. O

Delicious O
snack, B-TARGET
good O
range B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

Celebrate O
the O
New O
Year O
with O
friends O
and O
family. O

It O
was O
very O
fun! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
positive O
home O
because O
of O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
welcoming O
staff. B-TARGET

Interesting O
entertainment O
program B-TARGET
and O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much!! O

We O
have O
celebrated O
the O
new O
year O
and O
we O
will O
come O
here O
more O
often. O

It O
was O
January O
18, O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
boring, O
but O
I O
was O
wrong. O

Everything O
was O
like O
the O
New O
Year O
at O
the O
top O
level O
and O
the O
musicians B-TARGET
did O
not O
miss. O

Good O
calcium B-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices. O

I O
put O
5 O
out O
of O
5 O
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
for O
a O
vacation O
with O
friends O
and O
family. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went, O
I O
wanted O
to O
drink O
coffee. O

Immediately O
was O
fascinated O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
staff: I-TARGET
they O
meet O
as O
if O
they O
were O
waiting O
for O
you O
and O
are O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
visit. O

The B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
cakes B-TARGET
excellent. O

Then O
several O
times O
we O
went O
in O
with O
friends, O
sat O
down O
and O
drank O
a O
beer. O

The O
choice O
of O
beer B-TARGET
is O
small, O
but O
it O
is O
normal O
yet O
it O
is O
more O
confectionery... O

Although O
everyone O
has O
found O
a O
drink B-TARGET
to O
taste, O
there O
is O
also O
Timmermans B-TARGET
and O
Nevsky. B-TARGET

Very O
liked O
snacks: B-TARGET
and O
fried B-TARGET
wings, I-TARGET
and O
especially O
calmar. B-TARGET

They O
are O
also O
served O
with O
rings O
of O
onions. O

Truth O
without O
sauce, B-TARGET
in O
the O
menu O
we O
did O
not O
find O
sauce O
either, O
but O
a O
friendly O
servant B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
on O
our O
question O
about O
the O
sauce, O
offered O
2 O
types O
and O
immediately O
brought. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
it O
is O
a O
pity O
only O
that O
the O
sofas O
and O
plasma O
panel O
are O
only O
in O
the O
non-smoking O
room. O

Service B-TARGET
on O
10, O
all O
on O
time, O
sweet O
and O
with O
a O
smile. O

It O
is O
great O
that O
there O
is O
such O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
in O
our O
area. O

He O
brought O
a O
friend O
to O
this O
restaurant O
- O
he O
had O
a O
meeting O
there. O

It O
was O
late O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
there O
was O
not O
much O
people. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
noticed O
was O
the O
polite O
staff. B-TARGET

With O
a O
smile, O
they O
opened O
the O
door, O
offered O
to O
leave O
the O
coat, O
quickly O
brought O
the O
menu O
and O
also O
quickly O
approached O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
order O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
chose O
the O
desired O
for O
myself O
(and O
how O
did O
they O
just O
understand?). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
made O
in O
pleasant O
light O
tones, O
there O
are O
convenient O
(interesting) O
tables B-TARGET
near O
the O
walls, O
but O
the O
places B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
center O
of O
the O
restaurant O
are O
a O
little O
disappointing, O
because O
they O
are O
very O
uncomfortable. O

The O
order O
was O
delivered O
very O
quickly O
and O
everything O
was O
prepared O
quality O
and O
delicious. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are I-TARGET
medium, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
well O
decorated. O

There O
are O
only O
good O
impressions O
of O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
La I-TARGET
Fabrik I-TARGET
for O
a O
nice O
evening!) O

I O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
on O
March O
10. O

The O
impressions O
are O
the O
most O
wonderful. O

I O
read O
previous O
reviews O
here. O

I O
don’t O
know, O
but O
I O
think O
it’s O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
competitors! O
:) O

I O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
in O
Pauliner, O
and O
there O
is O
always O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
cuisine. B-TARGET

There O
is O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
beer B-TARGET
at O
all, O
it O
is O
above O
all O
praise! O

Yes, O
even O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
tables...we O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
his O
order... O

This O
time O
it O
was O
ordered O
the O
same O
day. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
polite, O
no O
one O
has O
cheated O
or O
counted O
us. O

Maria O
served O
our O
table, O
I O
want O
to O
thank O
her O
again! O

Very O
kind O
girl! B-TARGET

We’ve O
never O
had O
more O
than O
two O
squirrels O
on O
the O
table O
in O
the O
ashes, O
with O
such O
a O
frequency O
she O
changed O
them. O

She O
was O
very O
friendly, O
approached O
us O
gently, O
clarified O
if O
there O
was O
anything O
else O
needed. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
it O
didn’t O
look O
obsessive. O

The O
hotter O
brought O
in O
15 O
minutes O
after O
the O
order, O
we O
did O
not O
even O
expect O
such O
promptness! O

Overall, O
the O
impressions O
remained O
the O
most O
positive! O
(it O
is, O
however, O
as O
always!) O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
here O
again! O

The O
restaurant O
for O
me O
is O
first O
the O
kitchen, O
then O
the O
service O
and O
only O
then O
the O
interior O
and O
location. O

Yesterday O
visited O
it O
again O
and O
understood: O
if O
you O
want O
a O
losing O
option O
you O
have O
to O
go O
here. O

There O
are O
many O
establishments O
opening O
and O
closing O
in O
the O
city. O

What O
surprises O
me O
about O
this O
is O
that O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
(quality) O
has O
not O
changed O
for O
8!!! O
years. O

It O
is O
expensive. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are I-TARGET
large O
and O
very O
filled. O

The B-TARGET
quality I-TARGET
of O
meat O
is O
excellent. O

They O
prepare O
quickly O
but O
quality. O

5 O
for O
food. B-TARGET

The O
interior? O

Overall O
I O
like O
him. O

Quite O
stylish, O
tons O
very O
well O
picked O
up. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
still O
hang O
the O
large B-TARGET
windows I-TARGET
out O
on O
Nekrasov, O
some O
sort O
of O
semi-transparent O
foil. O

The B-TARGET
large I-TARGET
windows I-TARGET
look O
a O
little O
naked. O

I O
would O
give O
four O
services. B-TARGET

Everything O
is O
fine, O
fast, O
but O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
not O
professionals. O

It O
does O
not O
stress O
me O
personally. O

Surprisingly, O
after O
every O
visitor, O
the O
snow-white O
scarf O
on O
the O
table O
changes, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
absolutely O
clean. O

I O
was O
pleased O
to O
see O
it. O

Generally O
I O
recommend. O

And O
you O
can O
eat, O
and O
talk O
(music B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
noisy) O
and O
bring O
the O
lady O
and O
celebrate O
her O
birthday. O

I O
will O
walk O
and O
walk. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
my O
husband O
on O
Friday O
( O
17.01.14.) O
at O
23:00. O

The O
first O
person O
who O
met O
us O
was O
the O
car B-TARGET
driver, I-TARGET
helped O
us O
park O
and O
even O
opened O
the O
doors O
and O
polently O
greeted O
us. O

I O
like O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
I O
like O
this O
design. B-TARGET

Everything O
is O
simple O
and O
tasteful, O
a O
lot O
of O
interesting O
little O
things. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
nice O
girl. B-TARGET

Unfortunately, O
I O
did O
not O
remember O
her O
name. O

She O
was O
attentive O
and O
non-obsessive O
and O
helped O
me O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
pasta, O
telling O
in O
detail O
the O
composition O
and O
way O
of O
cooking O
the O
dish. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
large O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
magazine, O
there O
is O
everything O
you O
want...bags, O
sushi, O
vodka, O
pastas, O
etc. O

The O
design B-TARGET
of O
the O
menu O
is O
interesting, O
the O
designers O
are O
good! O

I O
ate O
cream O
soup O
from O
white O
mushrooms O
(approximately O
350 O
p.) O
and O
penne O
with O
strawberries O
( O
450 O
p.). O

The O
soup B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
just O
divine. O

Lots O
of O
sauce, B-TARGET
soft O
duck B-TARGET
meat. I-TARGET

I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
pasta.) B-TARGET

My O
husband O
ate O
a O
salad O
with O
beef O
and O
carpaccio O
(I O
don’t O
remember O
the O
price). O

We O
liked O
everything O
very O
much. O

From O
the O
visit O
we O
received O
positive O
emotions...tasted O
and O
eaten O
delicious! O

We O
will O
come O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
cooks B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
for O
the O
good O
emotions! O

Per O
it O
was O
"work O
on O
mistakes", O
and O
maybe O
- O
we O
were O
just O
lucky O
;) O
February O
23 O
with O
a O
friend O
visited O
this O
restaurant. O

A O
little O
bit O
of O
cheating,, O
but O
generally O
no O
special O
complaints. O

Very O
polite O
waitresses, B-TARGET
welcoming O
all O
the O
guests O
right O
at O
the O
entrance. O

We O
ordered O
the O
table O
in O
advance, O
so O
there O
were O
no O
problems O
with O
the O
seats. O

Pleasant, O
disposable O
interiors, B-TARGET
comfortable O
sofas. B-TARGET

Per O
too O
soft-dropping, O
but O
for O
a O
relaxed O
evening O
in O
a O
pleasant O
company O
- O
just O
that. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
who O
served O
our O
table O
(I O
don't O
know O
their O
name, O
unfortunately) O
- O
attentive O
and O
warning, O
gladly O
answered O
all O
our O
questions. O

Dirty O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
did O
not O
delay, O
the O
appliances O
did O
not O
have O
to O
be O
reminded, O
the O
ashes O
changed O
over O
the O
years. O

Amazingly O
delicious O
branded O
rolls, B-TARGET
unexpectedly O
(for O
a O
Japanese O
restaurant) O
large O
portions B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
hot. I-TARGET

To O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
- O
no O
claims; O
maybe O
hotter O
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
faster O
- O
but O
we O
did O
not O
rush O
and O
in O
the O
smooth O
course O
of O
the O
evening O
a O
small O
delay O
in O
principle O
fit. O

Overall O
- O
the O
impressions O
are O
only O
positive, O
I O
think O
we O
will O
come O
again O
- O
especially O
since O
we O
live O
nearby. O

Good O
day! O

I O
am O
writing O
about O
my O
impressions O
of O
visiting O
this O
restaurant. O

I O
saw O
the O
advertisement O
of O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
courtyard O
and O
decided O
to O
try... O
and O
did O
not O
regret!!!( O

We O
went O
up O
to O
the O
4th O
floor O
of O
the O
sports O
club. O

At O
the O
entrance, O
a O
woman O
met O
a O
waitress. O

I O
was O
sitting O
at O
the O
table O
by O
the O
window O
(looking B-TARGET
wonderful), O
they O
submitted O
the O
menu. O

There O
are O
not O
many O
foods B-TARGET
in O
the O
menu, O
but O
there O
is O
something O
to O
choose O
from. O

We O
ordered: O
vegetable O
smoothies, O
cereal O
smoothies, O
tea O
cup O
(a O
type O
of O
multifit), O
salad O
with O
homemade O
cheese, O
rucola O
with O
shrimp, O
salmon O
roulette O
with O
green O
spinach O
and O
tuna O
with O
vegetables O
grill. O

We O
got O
the O
drinks O
quickly, O
immediately O
after O
the O
salad O
and O
hot. O

Everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
beautiful! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
amazing: O
furniture, B-TARGET
utensils, B-TARGET
dishes, B-TARGET
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window, O
candles, B-TARGET
service! B-TARGET

My O
wife O
and O
I O
really O
liked O
it! O

We O
will O
come O
back O
to O
you O
and O
advise O
our O
friends!!! O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
wonderful! O

Very O
nice O
and O
polite O
staff, B-TARGET
already O
at O
the O
entrance, O
there O
is O
a O
feeling O
that O
they O
have O
been O
waiting O
for O
the O
guests O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

Large O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
cooking O
well O
and O
quickly. O

Large O
portions B-TARGET
– O
what O
is O
left O
packed O
with O
you. O

I O
liked O
the O
sound O
of O
quiet O
and O
relaxing O
music. B-TARGET

Fantastic O
interior, B-TARGET
as O
if O
you’re O
in O
a O
fairy O
tale. O

The O
evening O
was O
remembered O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

thank O
you! O

A O
great O
place! B-TARGET

My O
wife O
and O
I O
had O
a O
wedding O
anniversary O
and O
we O
always O
go O
to O
a O
new O
restaurant O
on O
this O
day. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Peter, O
but O
this O
time O
our O
choice O
fell O
on O
Legran. O

We’ve O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
things O
about O
him. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
it O
was O
a O
wonderful O
evening, O
respect O
the B-TARGET
chef!! I-TARGET

Everything O
was O
incredibly O
delicious O
and O
original! O

The O
interior, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
impresses O
immediately, O
already O
on O
the O
street O
all O
very O
nice O
nice O
tree B-TARGET
tree I-TARGET
and O
tui, B-TARGET
New O
Year's O
mood O
lamps, B-TARGET
inside O
cozy O
and O
chic, O
soft O
sofas, B-TARGET
candles, B-TARGET
white B-TARGET
piano. I-TARGET

For O
our O
occasion, O
it O
was O
just O
a O
100% O
appearance, O
even O
that O
evening O
there O
was O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
the O
pianist B-TARGET
played O
a O
white O
piano. O

Just O
a O
beauty! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
can O
say O
I O
was O
also O
pleased, O
at O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
smiling O
hostess B-TARGET
immediately O
a O
positive O
impression O
and O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
it O
remained! O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
were O
also O
very O
attentive O
and O
polite, O
I O
can't O
remember O
the O
moment O
when O
we O
didn't O
like O
something! O

In O
general, O
a O
great O
restaurant, B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
and O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
come O
back O
there O
myself. O

thank O
you! O

Overall, O
I O
and O
my O
friends O
really O
like O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
service B-TARGET
there O
is O
not O
bad, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
administrators B-TARGET
are O
always O
trying O
to O
help. O

I O
can't O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
guard O
- O
we O
did O
not O
notice O
them, O
so O
that O
they O
beat O
someone, O
there O
was O
no O
time O
with O
us O
(we O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
almost O
every O
week). O

It O
is O
very O
pleasant O
that O
in O
the O
evening, O
somewhere O
from O
9 O
a.m., O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
plays, O
you O
can O
dance O
and O
have O
a O
great O
time. O

The O
audience O
is O
decent, O
prices O
are O
moderate, O
its O
own O
brewery B-TARGET
produces O
excellent O
wheat B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
barley I-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
snacks B-TARGET
are O
also O
very O
good, O
a O
delicious O
cheese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
plate, I-TARGET
excellent O
milk B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
alcoholic I-TARGET
cocktails. I-TARGET

Overall, O
a O
very O
good, O
decent O
establishment, B-TARGET
really O
saddening O
is O
that O
tables O
for O
Thursday, O
Friday O
and O
weekend O
need O
to O
be O
booked O
somewhere O
in O
3 O
weeks. O

I O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
you O
will O
not O
regret O
it. O

Hi O
to. O

She O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
liked O
when O
entering O
the O
restaurant..we O
were O
conducted, O
they O
immediately O
learned O
that O
I O
ordered O
a O
table. O

The O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
is O
just O
a O
paradise. O

Very O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
so O
gentle O
and O
cozy. O

Even O
10 O
more O
for O
that!! O

Furthermore, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
varied, O
for O
every O
taste, O
but O
with O
detailed O
consideration, O
I O
ended O
up O
on O
fish, O
because O
I O
personally O
did O
not O
care O
about O
anything O
(pizza O
can O
be O
eaten O
in O
other O
more O
specialized O
places, O
pasta... O
well, O
I O
will O
do O
it O
at O
home, O
soup..not O
for O
the O
holiday). O

Prices O
for O
wine B-TARGET
are O
just O
crazy..although, O
maybe O
for O
such O
a O
restaurant O
it O
is O
normal, O
but O
in O
relation O
to O
food O
I O
seemed O
expensive! O

In O
general, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
close O
to O
Italian, O
but O
here O
is O
something O
super O
fairy O
I O
did O
not O
see, O
so O
only O
8. O

As O
for O
the O
service... B-TARGET
here O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
there O
are O
no O
claims, O
the O
plates O
were O
cleaned O
in O
time, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
interest O
in O
us O
especially O
in O
the O
girls. B-TARGET

The O
people O
were O
not O
so O
many O
(a O
large O
company O
was O
sitting O
at O
the O
neighboring O
table), O
so O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
be O
more O
vigorous O
and O
more O
lively. O

We O
sat O
in O
seven, O
left O
five O
thousand, O
but O
some O
satisfaction O
from O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
reception B-TARGET
did O
not O
get, O
although O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
beautifully O
served O
and O
decorated. O

Service B-TARGET
only O
6. O

Yesterday O
we O
were O
at O
the O
restaurant O
"Heaven", O
which O
I O
can O
say, O
I O
will O
break O
down O
by O
points. O

In O
the O
restaurant O
very O
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
in O
particular O
- O
sushi, B-TARGET
rolls, B-TARGET
pork B-TARGET
shishel, I-TARGET
warm B-TARGET
Mexican I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
(recommend)!!! O
2. O

Slightly O
not O
comfortable, O
from O
a O
large B-TARGET
space I-TARGET
and O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
(in O
winter), O
but O
in O
summer O
- O
this O
is O
a O
super O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window!!! O

Service, B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion, O
is O
very O
good, O
starting O
from O
meeting B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
guest I-TARGET
to O
wires. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
polite O
(especially O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
Anastasia), O
friendly O
and O
knows O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
dishes O
well, O
which O
is O
not O
very O
important. O

Overall O
a O
very O
pleasant O
impression!! O

I O
recommend O
to O
everyone!! O

We O
were O
on O
Saturday, O
November O
24, O
knowing O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
in O
advance O
ordered O
a O
table O
for O
10 O
people O
(meeting O
of O
classmates. O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
there O
were O
tables O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
people. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
chosen O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
space O
and O
the O
opportunity O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
large O
company, O
and O
still O
a O
familiar O
place. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
but O
it O
may O
be O
normal O
for O
such O
envy. O

Terribly O
smoked, O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
they O
have O
on O
the O
account O
of O
air B-TARGET
conditioners, I-TARGET
it O
is O
to O
consider O
that O
the O
restaurant O
has O
a O
children's O
room O
and O
a O
children's O
menu. O

There O
should O
be O
a O
separate O
area O
for O
smokers. O

I O
very O
much O
liked O
the O
Dor-Bryu B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
(tomates, O
cucumbers, O
pepper, O
fresh O
raw O
champignons, O
Dor-Bryu O
cheese, O
butter), O
a O
branded B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beer O
sausages, O
which O
when O
served O
burn, O
if O
honest, O
I O
thought O
the O
branded O
dish O
should O
be O
more O
ambassador. O

The B-TARGET
heat I-TARGET
was O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
grill O
was O
not O
the O
same. O

The O
music B-TARGET
is O
loud O
so O
the B-TARGET
officers I-TARGET
don't O
call O
and O
don't O
hear O
sometimes O
dishes O
to O
order, O
you O
sit O
waiting O
for O
50 O
minutes, O
and O
it O
turns O
out O
it's O
not O
ordered O
waiting O
for O
another O
50 O
minutes O
(this O
is O
how O
I O
write O
the O
cooking O
time O
for O
40-50 O
minutes). O

The O
maid B-TARGET
told O
me O
all O
the O
time O
that O
she O
couldn’t O
cook O
it O
faster O
and O
looked O
very O
tormented. O

Generally O
not O
bad. O

You O
can O
drink O
beer B-TARGET
with O
sausages B-TARGET
in O
the O
evening. O

But O
with O
children O
it O
is O
better O
to O
come O
to O
15.00 O
people O
less O
and O
children's O
holidays O
until O
this O
time. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good!! O

In O
this O
restaurant O
my O
future O
husband O
made O
me O
an O
offer O
(by O
the O
way, O
the O
wedding O
in O
a O
week O
and O
we O
will O
celebrate O
it O
only O
there). O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
10. O

I O
didn’t O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
menu, O
as O
is O
usually O
the O
case O
in O
some O
restaurants. O

We O
sat O
down, O
ordered O
Georgian O
dishes, O
champagne, O
in O
5 O
minutes O
we O
brought O
the O
most O
delicious O
champagne B-TARGET
I’ve O
ever O
drank O
in O
my O
life. O

The O
order O
also O
didn’t O
have O
to O
wait O
very O
long, O
20 O
minutes, O
okay. O

We O
ate, O
ate, O
and O
could O
not O
enjoy O
the O
food, B-TARGET
it O
was O
so O
delicious, O
unusual, O
because O
I O
was O
in O
a O
Georgian O
restaurant O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

It’s O
so O
quiet, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
so O
quiet O
and O
eastern.) O

I O
don’t O
really O
remember O
if O
she O
was O
alive. O

We O
were O
there O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
I O
know O
that O
there O
was O
a O
program. O

I O
really O
liked O
it!! O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
restaurant O
for O
any O
important O
event, O
you O
can O
safely O
go O
to O
"Tbilisi"!!! B-TARGET

If O
you O
don’t O
like O
it, O
you O
can O
beat O
me. O
:) O

Visited O
Yalta O
restaurant O
11.05.12, O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
Birthday, O

ordered O
a O
table O
for O
8 O
people O
a O
day O
before O
the O
celebration, O

When O
ordering, O
we O
showed O
a O
restaurant, O
offered O
several O
options O
for O
accommodation O
of O
our O
guests, O

we O
chose O
2 O
separate O
tables O
surrounded O
by O
sofas O
and O
chairs, O
next O
to O
a O
panoramic O
window, O

No O
advance O
payment O
for O
the O
order O
was O
left O
(which O
favorably O
distinguished O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
from O
the O
others, O
considering O
that O
our O
event O
was O
scheduled O
for O
Friday O
evening). O

The O
restaurant O
is O
favorably O
distinguished O
by O
a O
calm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
pleasant, O
not O
loud O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
which O
leaves O
a O
chance O
for O
a O
pleasant O
conversation. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
not O
obsessive, O
I O
would O
say O
unnoticeable, O
very O
nice O
waiters, B-TARGET
immediately O
brought O
a O
vase O
for O
flowers, O
accepted O
the O
order, O
all O
very O
polite, O
with O
good O
knowledge B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
menu O
and O
kindness. O

The B-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
delighted O
with O
a O
variety, O
good, O
informative O
menu, B-TARGET
according O
to O
which O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
choose O
a O
dish O
for O
any O
taste, O
as O
presented O
Japanese, O
Russian, O
Georgian O
cuisine. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
large, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good, O
the O
taste O
is O
excellent. O

The O
check O
was O
slightly O
higher O
than O
in O
other O
restaurants O
of O
this O
class, O
but O
our O
positive O
emotions O
were O
worth O
it. O

Very O
nice O
time, O
very O
happy O
that O
you O
chose O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
satisfied O
with O
the O
level O
of O
service B-TARGET
and O
kitchen. B-TARGET

We O
arrived O
on O
Saturday O
at O
5 O
p.m. O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
December. O

Of O
course O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

The O
order O
was O
waiting O
for O
an O
hour, O
that O
is, O
even O
the O
salads O
brought O
us O
only O
after O
an O
hour, O
why O
somehow O
together O
with O
hot. O

At O
the O
next O
table, O
the O
order O
was O
confused O
and O
after O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting, O
people O
got O
not O
what O
they O
wanted. O

Pasta B-TARGET
and O
risotto B-TARGET
were O
not O
bad. O

In O
principle, O
nothing O
outstanding, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
expect O
anything, O
just O
went O
for O
lunch. O

I O
didn’t O
like O
the O
long O
wait O
and O
the O
alienation O
of O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
just O
went O
out O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
bench...while O
we O
wanted O
to O
pay. O

I O
sat O
for O
10 O
minutes, O
chatted O
with O
someone O
and O
finally O
came O
to O
us, O
but O
with O
such O
a O
kind O
of O
guy O
I O
didn’t O
wait O
for O
anything... O
politeness O
and O
desire O
to O
serve O
guests O
I O
didn’t O
notice O
him. O

Comfortable, O
tight, O
we O
were O
not O
lucky O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Soup B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

I’ll O
go O
for O
tea O
and O
dessert O
if O
I O
go O
by. O

before O
often O
went O
to O
this O
institution, O
first, O
is O
in O
a O
convenient O
place O
for O
me, O
second O
there O
is O
a O
card O
with O
a O
discount O
of O
10%. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good, O
I O
can O
say O
nothing, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
lately O
(since O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
summer) O
leave O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
constantly O
forget O
something, O
with O
a O
small O
number O
of O
visitors, O
the O
order O
has O
to O
wait O
sometimes O
up O
to O
40-50 O
minutes!!! O

We O
do O
not O
take O
hot. O

Brewing B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
was O
not O
what O
was O
brought O
without O
foam, O
without O
bubbles. O

This O
is O
why O
we O
now O
choose O
other O
sushi O
bars. O

Hopefully O
Vassili B-TARGET
will O
change O
again O
for O
the O
better. O

and O
luck. O

Anna O

My O
colleagues O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
noisy O
company. O

Our O
choice O
stopped O
at O
the O
new O
pub O
"John O
Donn". O

Overall, O
the O
best O
impressions O
remain. O

When O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
pub, O
all O
staff B-TARGET
friendly O
greetings, O
further O
a O
cute O
girl B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
offered O
us O
a O
couple O
of O
tables O
to O
choose O
from. O

Almost O
immediately O
we O
were O
given O
the O
menu, O
informing O
that O
this O
establishment O
had O
a O
very O
interesting O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
as O
we O
were O
not O
familiar O
with O
the O
range O
of O
English O
beer, O
we O
were O
provided O
with O
comments O
to O
the O
positions O
of O
interest O
and O
even O
brought O
a O
small O
amount O
to O
try, O
which O
is O
undoubtedly O
pleasant! O

We O
tried O
almost O
all O
the O
beers, O
everyone O
found O
beer B-TARGET
to O
their O
taste. O

The B-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
was O
delighted, O
a O
large O
beer B-TARGET
plate, I-TARGET
really O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
big O
and O
delicious! O

Various O
snacks B-TARGET
are O
not O
banal O
as O
in O
most O
establishments. O

From O
the O
hot O
dishes O
I O
can O
recommend O
Fish B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Chips, I-TARGET
Strike B-TARGET
New I-TARGET
York. I-TARGET

But O
the O
minus O
is O
also O
present, O
a O
colleague O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
wanted O
a O
dessert O
and O
stopped O
her O
choice O
on O
sorbets, B-TARGET
but O
learning O
that O
for O
150 O
rubles O
she O
got O
50 O
grams, O
that O
is, O
one O
ball O
was O
slightly O
upset. O

Yet O
it O
is O
expensive. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
nice O
classic O
for O
the O
pub, O
football O
matches O
are O
broadcast O
on O
TV. O

In O
general, O
a O
good O
mental O
condition. B-TARGET

We O
will O
undoubtedly O
come O
back O
many O
times! O

This O
restaurant O
celebrated O
a O
birthday O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
on O
Saturday O
evening. O

I O
want O
to O
express O
my O
great O
thanks O
first O
of O
all O
to O
the O
management B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
the O
service O
staff B-TARGET
and, O
of O
course, O
those O
employees B-TARGET
who O
prepare O
such O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
to O
the O
visitors O
of O
the O
institution. O

I O
liked O
absolutely O
everything. O

Of O
course, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
impressive: O
cozy O
and O
beautiful. O

The O
table B-TARGET
was O
great. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
the O
Bahram O
waitress, B-TARGET
thank O
him. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
of O
this O
level O
the O
prices O
are O
not O
high. O

I O
was O
with O
my O
husband, O
wanted O
to O
celebrate O
the O
date O
of O
dating, O
but! O

For O
a O
long O
time O
(minutes O
15-20) O
we O
waited O
in O
the O
closet O
until O
we O
were O
invited O
inside, O
although O
it O
was O
already O
late O
enough O
and O
when O
we O
entered O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
hall O
was O
half O
empty. O

Okay... O

Not O
nervous... O

Well O
done, O
the O
celebration O
is... O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting. O

I O
ordered O
meals, O
I O
don't O
remember O
the O
names O
(I'm O
something O
from O
chicken, O
my O
husband O
wanted O
to O
try O
horse O
meat). O

Hot B-TARGET
cooked O
for O
10 O
minutes... O
fast O
– O
I O
don’t O
argue, O
but O
how O
can O
you O
cook O
a O
horse O
in O
10 O
minutes? O

There O
was O
a O
complete O
feeling O
of O
both O
appearance O
and O
taste O
that O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
stood O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
and O
were O
just O
heated O
in O
the O
microwave. O

No O
salt, B-TARGET
no O
spices, B-TARGET
absolutely O
fresh O
food B-TARGET
(although O
I O
don’t O
argue O
someone O
loves O
it O
anyway, O
but O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
could O
warn O
and O
put O
more O
spices O
on O
the O
table)! O

Served O
just O
nothing. O

They O
couldn’t O
eat. O

Mood O
is O
imported. O

The O
most O
edible O
was O
a O
salad B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
greens I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
vegetables, I-TARGET
agree, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
spoil. O

Prices O
are O
generally O
average, O
but O
in O
such O
a O
kitchen B-TARGET
are O
completely O
unjustified. O

We O
won’t O
go O
there O
for O
a O
fee O
anymore. O

A O
normal O
institution, B-TARGET
but O
in O
my O
opinion, O
not O
“great.” O

First, O
it O
is O
very O
noisy: O
the O
hall B-TARGET
is O
small O
and O
when O
everyone O
speaks O
at O
once O
(and O
there O
were O
many O
visitors), O
there O
is O
such O
a O
noise O
that O
you O
can’t O
hear O
what O
your O
companions O
are O
talking O
about, O
sitting O
opposite O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
themselves O
are O
located O
quite O
close O
to O
each O
other. O

Second, O
it O
is O
quite O
expensive. O

Third, O
service: B-TARGET
it O
was O
very O
unpleasant O
to O
hang O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
hall O
in O
the O
upper O
clothes O
(all O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
ran O
around O
the O
hall, O
no O
one O
met O
and O
showed O
where O
the O
closet O
- O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
closet O
between O
the O
toilets:)), O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
brought O
meals O
first, O
and O
then O
the O
appliances, O
the O
account O
was O
carried O
for O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
when O
they O
left, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
closet O
gave O
out O
not O
all O
the O
jackets O
and O
left... O
the O
little O
things, O
but O
they O
make O
an O
impression. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
and O
location B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good, O
no O
complaints, O
tried O
ravioli B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
truffles I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
ricotta I-TARGET
(380 O
p.) O
and O
cream B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
pumpkin I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
parmesan I-TARGET
(380 O
p.) O
(so O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
I O
chose O
the O
cheapest O
dishes O
from O
the O
menu:)). O

Red O
wine O
- O
260 O
rubles O
/ O
glass. O

A O
check O
for O
4 O
girls O
with O
wine O
was O
about O
6000. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
Katie, O
our O
leader B-TARGET
;) O

We O
celebrated O
the O
19.04 O
wedding O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
there O
were O
few O
guests, O
only O
45 O
people, O
walking O
in O
the O
lower O
hall. O

I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
itself O
- O
very O
beautiful, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
pleases O
the O
eye, O
secondly, O
fed O
for O
slaughter)) O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
everything, O
and O
everything O
was O
delicious! O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
we O
took O
what O
was O
left O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
ate O
home. O

From O
the O
menu O
we O
selected, O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
salad B-TARGET
"Laguna", I-TARGET
strawberries B-TARGET
and O
roulette B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushrooms. I-TARGET

Meat O
and O
fish O
were O
50 O
to O
50. O

I O
chose O
a O
fish-stick B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
furry, I-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
juicy O
and O
tasty. O

Third, O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

We O
chose O
the O
tamada O
offered O
by O
the O
restaurant O
- O
Dimu. O

A O
very O
fun O
and O
positive O
person, B-TARGET
a O
professional O
in O
his O
business. O

Thank O
you O
separately! O

The O
director B-TARGET
is O
a O
soulful O
person, O
takes O
into O
account O
all O
wishes O
and O
advises O
what O
and O
how O
best O
to O
do. O

In O
the O
end, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
we O
liked O
it! O
we O
rested O
well, O
nothing O
ruined O
the O
mood, O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
mistakes O
except O
for O
the O
little O
things, O
without O
which, O
as O
we O
understand, O
we O
can't O
do. O

We O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

thank O
you! O

A O
very O
decent O
facility. B-TARGET

Very O
pleased O
with O
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

We O
were O
at O
the O
concert O
of O
the O
group O
“Tonight”. O

It O
is O
amazing. O

They B-TARGET
know O
how O
to O
burn O
for O
100! O

The O
public B-TARGET
from O
small O
to O
small O
broke O
all O
night O
but O
for O
the O
eo O
already O
a O
big O
thank O
you O
personally O
to O
them, O
although O
the O
administration B-TARGET
of O
the O
bar O
also O
has O
something O
to O
thank O
- O
the O
concert O
was O
absolutely O
free! O

There O
is O
also O
a O
very O
picky O
bartender B-TARGET
- O
looks O
like O
a O
cook O
from O
cartoons! O

I O
do O
not O
complain O
about O
the O
service B-TARGET
either, O
although O
ideal O
for O
now O
to O
call O
difficult. O

At O
the O
concert O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
could O
not O
wait, O
apparently O
there O
was O
a O
big O
turmoil O
around. O

Of O
course, O
I O
can’t O
help O
but O
mention O
beer! B-TARGET
for O
it O
I O
would O
separate O
the O
scale O
and O
put O
11...out O
of O
10! O
that’s O
more O
than O
great! O

And O
the O
prices O
for O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
of O
such O
a O
level O
can O
not O
but O
rejoice O
- O
real O
beer B-TARGET
from O
100 O
rubles. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
a O
huge O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
administration! B-TARGET

Keep O
it O
so O
:) O

At O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
restaurant O
you O
are O
met O
by O
an O
unusual O
interior, B-TARGET
a O
guard O
and O
a O
friendly O
administrator. B-TARGET

Go O
to O
one O
of O
the O
four O
halls, O
and O
then O
as O
usual: O
sit O
down, O
wait O
for O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
(he O
comes O
fast O
enough), O
order O
food O
and O
wait O
15-20 O
minutes. O

The O
situation B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
quite O
interesting. O

If O
you O
take O
into O
account O
the O
kitchen, O
then O
how O
will O
it O
be: O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
themselves O
are O
delicious, O
but O
it O
all O
depends, O
probably O
on O
the O
chef O
or O
his O
mood, O
on O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products O
themselves O
or O
something O
else, O
I O
don’t O
know..., O
in O
general, O
having O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
several O
times O
and O
ordering O
the O
same O
hot O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed, O
because O
the O
first O
time O
I O
was O
brought O
a O
gorgeous O
meat B-TARGET
dish, I-TARGET
but O
the O
second O
time O
I, O
gently O
speaking, O
very O
much O
regretted O
ordering O
it: O
the O
meat B-TARGET
is O
hard, O
does O
not O
chew, O
the O
knife O
cuts O
badly, O
and O
hardly O
even O
warm... O
darkness. O

Not O
even O
a O
very O
bad O
establishment. B-TARGET

Who O
was O
not O
advised O
to O
try. O

We O
went O
last O
week O
to O
Nelson O
pub O
with O
friends O
to O
drink O
a O
beer, O
we O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
greeting O
of O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
so O
kind O
people O
we O
have O
never O
seen O
before! O

We O
were O
served O
by O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Evgenia, O
we O
know O
her O
from O
another O
restaurant, O
a O
very O
good O
and O
nice O
girl, B-TARGET
will O
always O
tell O
and O
advise, O
what O
you O
can O
eat, O
and O
what O
you O
can O
drink. O

We O
drank O
beer B-TARGET
at O
this O
establishment O
and O
we O
really O
liked O
it, O
the O
beer B-TARGET
was O
fresh. O

We O
ordered O
the O
pastas, B-TARGET
so O
they O
were O
delicious, O
that O
we O
were O
ready O
to O
order O
the O
second O
portion, O
but O
could O
not, O
because O
in O
the O
Nelson O
pub O
large O
and O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
building. O

I O
liked O
everything. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
100%, O
and O
I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
ask O
the O
staff B-TARGET
so O
that O
the O
guys O
always O
remain O
so O
kind O
and O
joyful. O

I O
advise O
everyone O
to O
visit O
Nelson B-TARGET
pub I-TARGET
and O
get O
there O
only O
good O
emotions!!! O

Good O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
good O
service. B-TARGET

I O
was O
in O
it O
twice. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
pleased. O

Cozy O
interior B-TARGET
in O
Italian O
style, O
polite O
and O
attentive O
girls B-TARGET
waitresses, I-TARGET
pleasant O
music B-TARGET
without O
booms. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
although O
some O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
cooked O
not O
according O
to O
the O
rules. O

Most O
importantly, O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

Both O
times O
when O
we O
were O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
only O
2-3 O
tables O
were O
occupied O
in O
parallel O
with O
us. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
perfect O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner. O

Dinner O
for O
two O
costs O
around O
2000r. O

As O
I O
promised, O
I O
leave O
my O
review O
about O
You! O
:) O
On O
July O
13, O
2014, O
my O
brother's O
wedding O
was O
in O
this O
restaurant! O

Everything O
very O
much O
liked: O
beautifully O
decorated O
hall, B-TARGET
cozy O
interior, B-TARGET
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
))) O

Service B-TARGET
at O
a O
very O
high O
level!! O

Nothing O
like O
this O
had O
ever O
happened O
before... O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
were O
very O
attentive, O
it O
was O
always O
clean O
on O
the O
table O
and O
didn’t O
even O
have O
to O
pour O
anything O
and O
put O
it O
on! O

I O
especially O
want O
to O
mention O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Elena, O
unfortunately O
I O
don't O
know O
the O
name, O
who O
served O
the O
table O
of O
the O
bridegroom O
and O
bride!)))) O

And O
I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
say O
that O
I O
did O
not O
leave O
any O
reviews O
anywhere O
before O
and O
thought O
that O
the O
positive O
is O
mostly O
written O
by O
the O
employees O
of O
the O
institution O
themselves, O
but O
it O
is O
just O
hard O
not O
to O
write O
when O
such O
good O
and O
kind O
people O
are O
trying O
for O
your O
holiday))))))) O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O
😉 O
😉 O
😉 O
😉 O
😉 O

marked O
his O
birthday. O

Like O
3 O
years O
ago, O
there O
is O
nothing O
new O
in O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
only O
pizza O
and O
pasta. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
add O
new O
dishes O
to O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at O
least O
once O
a O
year O
so O
that O
people O
are O
interested O
in O
trying O
something O
new. O

Alongside O
us, O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
ordered O
and O
something O
was O
celebrated O
everywhere. O

Snacking O
with O
the O
same O
pizzas, B-TARGET
pastas B-TARGET
and O
exactly O
the O
same O
salads B-TARGET
(their O
8 O
pieces O
and O
they’re O
all O
made O
of O
vegetables B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
Mozarella) I-TARGET
– O
I O
personally O
was O
ashamed O
before O
my O
friends O
that O
I O
brought O
them O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
because O
the O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
is O
really O
small. O

If O
you O
consider O
this O
institution O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
going O
out O
to O
eat O
- O
a O
good O
place, B-TARGET
true O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
not O
expensive. O

In O
general, O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
owner B-TARGET
is O
talented, O
he O
has O
made O
both O
a O
cafe O
and O
a O
restaurant O
together, O
and O
since O
the O
very O
opening, O
crowds O
have O
rolled O
here O
to O
the O
people. O

I O
want O
my O
feedback O
to O
reach O
the O
administration, O
and O
they O
began O
to O
diversify O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
meat O
dishes, O
garments, O
interesting O
salads O
and O
soups. O

Good O
day! O

I O
went O
with O
a O
girl O
at O
22.12 O
and O
she O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

In O
general, O
she O
loves O
Chinese O
cuisine O
more O
and O
constantly O
drags O
me O
to O
all O
kinds O
of O
Chinese O
restaurants, O
but O
I O
don’t O
much O
share O
her O
enthusiasm O
for O
Chinese O
delicacies. O

Some O
dishes, O
generally O
better O
not O
know O
how O
and O
from O
what O
they O
are O
cooked)) O

Well, O
then O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
the O
boss O
invited O
her O
to O
Dacha. O

We O
had O
a O
nice O
time O
- O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
a O
beautifully O
decorated O
hall. B-TARGET

As O
soon O
as O
we O
arrived, O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
approached O
us. O

I O
do O
not O
like O
when O
you O
sit O
and O
wait O
for O
a O
long O
time O
when O
you O
are O
paid O
attention, O
here O
everything O
is O
very O
quick, O
polite. O

The O
order O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
long. O

Overall, O
the O
evening O
was O
great, O
next O
time O
I O
will O
definitely O
bring O
my O
girlfriend O
to O
you. O

The O
wedding O
was O
celebrated O
at O
the O
Kirokny O
Dvor O
restaurant. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
all O
the O
staff O
of O
this O
institution. O

There O
were O
47 O
guests O
with O
us, O
the O
hall B-TARGET
was O
free O
and O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
space B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
the O
dances, O
which O
I O
was O
very O
concerned O
about. O

The O
administrators B-TARGET
helped O
us O
with O
the O
design O
of O
the O
hall O
and O
the O
search O
for O
guides O
(for O
which O
we O
also O
thank O
you O
very O
much). O

The O
menu O
was O
selected O
for O
1800, O
alcohol O
was O
allowed O
to O
bring O
our O
own. O

Everything O
was O
very O
delicious, O
a O
wide O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
large O
portions, B-TARGET
and O
the O
main O
thing, O
the O
guests O
were O
satisfied O
and O
satisfied. O

All O
went O
on O
5+. O

I O
will O
definitely O
recommend O
you O
to O
everyone O
I O
know. O

Thank O
you O
again! O

Anna O
and O
Ivan O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
great, O
everything O
was O
delicious. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
10 O
beautiful, O
cozy. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
6. O

I O
ordered O
a O
table O
the O
day O
before O
the O
visit. O

I O
wanted O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
birthday O
evening. O

I’ve O
been O
to O
Mango B-TARGET
twice, O
so O
I O
chose O
it. O

She O
specified O
that O
the O
table O
should O
be O
on O
the O
wall O
with O
a O
couch. O

And O
when O
they O
arrived, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
hall O
knew O
nothing O
about O
this O
armor. O

There O
is O
no O
manager B-TARGET
in O
place. O

The B-TARGET
walls O
with O
sofas O
are O
all O
occupied. O

and O
disappointment. O

Here O
are O
you O
and O
dr. O

We O
were O
offered O
to O
sit O
at O
any O
table O
and O
resettle O
when O
necessary O
is O
released. O

They O
did O
so. O

Overall, O
the O
evening O
was O
not O
bad! O

Everything O
I O
ordered O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
was O
delicious. O

brought O
everything O
on O
time. O

We O
made O
a O
discount O
as O
a O
name O
and O
a O
compliment O
- O
a O
bowl O
with O
lemonade O
of O
our O
own O
preparation. O

Also O
delicious O
too. O

We O
did O
everything O
we O
could O
to O
make O
us O
happy. O

A B-TARGET
clever I-TARGET
waitress. I-TARGET

Therefore, O
the O
service B-TARGET
rating O
is O
not O
the O
lowest.) O

I O
don’t O
know O
who’s O
to O
blame, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
hall O
don’t O
know O
anything O
about O
armor. O

But O
if O
the O
manager B-TARGET
goes O
somewhere, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
he O
must O
surely O
leave O
information O
about O
the O
ordered O
tables O
to O
someone! O

Yesterday O
we O
were O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
really O
at O
the O
Academic! O

I O
want O
to O
write O
thank O
you! O

We O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance O
and O
wanted O
a O
specific O
one. O

No O
problems O
arose, O
we O
arrived O
10 O
minutes O
before O
the O
scheduled O
time, O
the O
table O
was O
ready. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
administrator I-TARGET
- O
very O
polite, O
smiling, O
spent, O
immediately O
brought O
the O
menu. O

It O
wasn’t O
long O
before O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
arrived. O

Unfortunately, O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
my O
name! O

I O
am O
so O
grateful O
to O
him! O

Non-obsessive, O
always O
in O
the O
field O
of O
sight, O
guesses O
desires, O
with O
humor. O

Food O
was O
brought O
very O
quickly, O
to O
any O
question O
on O
the O
menu, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
answers O
without O
thinking, O
very O
professionally O
worked O
out. O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
visitors O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
but O
you O
can O
hardly O
hear O
people O
at O
the O
neighboring O
tables. O

The O
planning B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
well O
thought O
out, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
silent. O

We O
were O
entirely O
excited. O

Three O
hours O
passed O
in O
one O
breath. O

I O
recommend O
everyone O
to O
go, O
but O
it O
is O
better O
to O
book O
a O
table, O
especially O
in O
the O
evening! O

Prices O
are O
quite O
reasonable: O
for O
a O
big O
pizza B-TARGET
and O
6 O
cocktails B-TARGET
we O
paid O
2200 O

I O
was O
on O
my O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

I O
liked O
everything O
very O
much. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Dmitry O
- O
very O
polite O
and O
friendly! O

I O
ordered O
caesar O
salad, B-TARGET
pasta B-TARGET
and O
pizza B-TARGET
- O
it O
all O
liked! O

Even O
Dmitry O
advised O
us O
very O
delicious O
white B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
and O
learning O
that O
I O
have O
a O
holiday O
- O
as O
a O
gift O
we O
got O
a O
fruit O
plate! O

I O
want O
to O
point O
out O
the O
interior B-TARGET
- O
stylish, O
warm O
and O
cozy. O

Come O
in O
again! O

I O
recommend. O

Good O
day! O

I O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
on O
November O
22. O

I O
went O
with O
my O
parents. O

remained O
very O
satisfied. O

Pros: O
- O
Very O
pleasant O
interior, B-TARGET
silent, O
soft O
light, B-TARGET
quiet O
music B-TARGET
(does O
not O
hinder O
communication). O

A O
large O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
quite O
varied. O

We O
were O
served O
very O
quickly. O

Immediately O
served O
drinks, O
a O
few O
later O
brought O
salads O
and, O
we O
did O
not O
have O
time O
to O
eat, O
as O
they O
started O
serving O
hot. O

And O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
served O
immediately O
and O
it O
was O
already O
heavily O
cooled, O
which O
was O
especially O
liked. O

Very O
pleased O
with O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Everything O
was O
delicious! O

We O
ordered O
quite O
a O
variety O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
absolutely O
liked O
everything! O

Special O
thanks O
to O
the O
cook! O

Eat O
from O
the O
heart O
and O
for O
pleasure))) O
- O
Well, O
of O
course, O
I O
was O
very O
surprised O
and O
delighted O
with O
the O
account)) O

We O
were O
6 O
people, O
we O
ordered O
salads, O
two O
kinds O
of O
dishes O
with O
strawberries, O
tofu, O
duck, O
fish, O
two O
kinds O
of O
meat, O
snacks O
and O
alcohol O
(moderate) O
and O
cost O
three O
with O
pennies. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
were O
huge. O

We O
have O
moved.) O

I O
didn’t O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
people O
smoked O
in O
the O
room. B-TARGET

As O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
common, O
then O
in O
the O
end O
all O
the O
clothes O
were O
worn O
out O
( O

I O
didn’t O
like O
the O
toilets B-TARGET
very O
much. O

Looks O
clean, O
but O
how O
it’s O
not O
proper. O

Overall, O
the O
impression O
is O
very O
good. O

Of O
course, O
we O
will O
come O
back. O

I O
was O
in O
this O
institution O
before O
and O
always O
noticed O
that O
the O
staff O
here O
is O
a O
bit O
slow, O
but O
in O
principle, O
there O
were O
no O
special O
claims, O
everyone O
was O
friendly O
to O
this O
day. O

Here O
we O
go O
after O
the O
theater, O
my O
mom O
and O
I O
happy O
and O
happy, O
and O
for O
my O
trouble O
I O
decide O
to O
take O
her O
in O
a O
long B-TARGET
tail. I-TARGET

When O
we O
entered O
we O
were O
very O
kindly O
welcomed O
and O
offered O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
first O
floor, O
not O
thinking O
for O
a O
long O
time O
sitting O
almost O
at O
the O
entrance O
next O
to O
the O
bar. O

I O
will O
note O
that O
the O
people O
were O
not O
too O
many, O
that O
surprised O
me, O
but O
I O
think O
everyone O
is O
sitting O
on O
top, O
so O
everything O
will O
be O
fast O
enough... O

After O
we O
sat O
down O
10 O
minutes O
and O
we O
transferred O
the O
menu, O
which O
mom O
was O
very O
pleased, O
very O
quickly O
chose O
what O
to O
eat O
and O
began O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
waitress, O
at O
the O
entrance O
stood O
a O
girl B-TARGET
hostess, I-TARGET
who O
was O
very O
nice O
talking O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
her O
girlfriend, O
all O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
ran O
past O
us, O
on O
timid O
words, O
girl O
/ O
young O
man O
can O
you? O

We O
were O
answered O
with O
a O
sincere O
ignorance, O
after O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting O
we O
just O
got O
up O
and O
left, O
the O
mood O
was O
ruined, O
and O
so O
I O
wanted O
to O
please O
my O
mom!!!! O

The O
evaluations O
of O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
interior O
put O
from O
past O
experience, O
I O
hope O
nothing O
has O
changed. O

But O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

So O
40 O
minutes O
of O
time O
wasted, O
and O
no O
result. O

I’ve O
never O
written O
reviews, O
but O
I O
just O
have O
to! O

We O
were O
looking O
with O
friends O
for O
a O
good O
place O
in O
the O
north, O
so O
that O
it O
was O
cozy, O
not O
very O
noisy O
as O
in O
popular O
cafes O
and O
bars, O
but O
not O
a O
restaurant O
- O
generally O
a O
decent O
pub O
for O
good O
drinks O
and O
snacks. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
exactly O
what O
we O
need! O

And O
even O
better. O

However, O
the O
very O
fact O
that O
we O
managed O
to O
sit O
in O
this O
institution B-TARGET
I O
consider O
lucky O
- O
saw O
a O
free O
table O
almost O
in O
the O
corner O
- O
just O
lucky O
that O
it O
was O
free. O

Therefore, O
before O
we O
go O
here, O
we O
will O
reserve. O

I O
haven’t O
tried O
beer, O
so O
I O
won’t O
say O
anything. O

I O
tried O
the O
cocktails B-TARGET
- O
wonderful, O
it O
feels O
like O
they O
are O
made O
from O
good O
drinks, B-TARGET
as O
appropriate. O

A O
special O
thanks O
to O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
- O
she O
just O
guessed O
our O
wishes, O
and O
advised O
what O
we O
wanted. O

Service B-TARGET
of O
10 O
points. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

It O
is O
also O
worth O
noting O
the O
beautiful, O
cozy O
and O
stylish O
interior B-TARGET
and O
impeccably O
selected O
musical B-TARGET
background I-TARGET
(for O
those O
who O
matter). O

I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
home O
and O
all O
my O
own. O

Thank O
you O
Radio B-TARGET
for O
a O
great O
evening! O

Today O
we O
visited O
the O
whole O
family O
at O
the O
Marcelis O
restaurant. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time, O
remained O
satisfied, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
exceeded O
our O
expectations, O
not O
everywhere O
meet O
as O
if O
we O
came O
to O
visit O
friends)))) O

We O
came O
to O
eat O
around O
16 O
o’clock, O
the O
people O
had O
a O
full O
hall, O
the O
table O
was O
not O
ordered, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
sit O
very O
close O
to O
the O
door, O
but O
since O
we O
had O
small O
children, O
we O
were O
worried O
that O
the O
children O
would O
go O
out. O

The B-TARGET
administrator I-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
entered O
the O
position, O
and O
immediately O
resolved O
the O
issue O
(in O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
we O
were O
located O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
hall O
on O
soft O
sofas) B-TARGET
and O
immediately O
accepted O
the O
order. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
generally O
very O
pleasant O
and O
homey, O
dirty O
plates O
disappeared O
from O
the O
table O
unnoticed, O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
nice O
and O
smiling O
guys. O

In O
the O
kitchen: O
very O
liked O
the O
coat B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
spinach, I-TARGET
such O
a O
gentle O
coat B-TARGET
we O
did O
not O
meet O
anywhere, O
impressed O
with O
a O
salad B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
)) O
mostly O
all O
pleased, O
left O
satisfied O
and O
full. O

And O
also, O
we O
did O
not O
order O
desserts, O
because O
our O
dinner O
was O
quite O
full, O
but O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
were O
served O
with O
snacks O
in O
small O
drinks, O
(in O
my O
opinion, O
pancotta). B-TARGET

Now O
we O
are O
frequent O
guests O
in O
this O
institution, B-TARGET
all O
family O
holidays O
will O
be O
celebrated O
in O
Marcellis. B-TARGET

Keep O
it, O
guys, O
thank O
you O
very O
much. O

P O

S: O
I O
can’t O
help O
but O
note O
the O
treacherous O
attitude B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
children O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
my O
kids O
there O
so O
liked O
it, O
barely O
brought O
home)))) O

at O
the O

We O

a O

flower O

The O

is O
just O
a O

About O

very O

Special O

to O

Everything O

Everything O

We O
also O
received O
a O

The O

invited O
his, O
as O
they O
agreed O
with O
him O
before O

Sometimes O
I O
go O
to O
this O
place O
to O
drink O
a O
beer O
with O
friends O
or O
two O
with O
a O
girlfriend. O

On O
Fridays O
and O
weekends O
people O
are O
always O
a O
lot, O
there O
are O
simply O
no O
places, O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
table B-TARGET
small O
by O
the O
window, O
not O
quite O
convenient, O
but O
if O
there O
is O
no O
choice. O

Therefore, O
if O
we O
are O
going O
to O
go O
together, O
I O
order O
this O
table O
at O
the O
window, O
because O
to O
order O
a O
regular O
table O
deposit O
for O
3000 O
rubles, O
it O
is O
expensive, O
usually O
the O
bill O
comes O
out O
of O
us O
1 O
thousand O
per O
person O
with O
beer O
and O
food. O

Beer B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
as O
a O
rule, O
I O
take O
winstein B-TARGET
light I-TARGET
- O
already O
a O
classic, O
sometimes O
I O
try O
something O
new. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
generally O
delicious, O
no O
complaints, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
adequate. O

Servicing O
when, O
sometimes O
rumbling, O
depends O
on O
the O
waitress, O
in O
my O
opinion O
the O
waitress O
should O
always O
be O
kind O
and O
kind-hearted-of O
this O
and O
depends O
my O
assessment. O

In O
general, O
a O
good O
place, B-TARGET
conveniently O
located O
in O
the O
center B-TARGET
of O
the O
city O
right O
next O
to O
the O
subway, O
I O
recommend. O

I O
like O
it O
so O
much!! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
fashionable, O
modern, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
wonderful, O
the O
girls B-TARGET
are O
beautiful, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
amazing, O
everything O
you O
don’t O
order O
is O
more O
delicious! O

go O
wrong! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
always O
very O
good O
and O
decent, O
all O
friendly, O
smiling! O

The O
only O
thing O
was O
here O
one O
nuance, O
went O
with O
a O
girlfriend O
on O
Saturday O
to O
eat, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
host I-TARGET
continuously O
positive, O
it O
was O
evening, O
almost O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
occupied O
or O
reserved, O
but O
she O
still O
found O
us O
a O
very O
good O
place. O

Sitting O
down, O
brought O
the B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
waiter, I-TARGET
left, O
waited O
for O
20 O
minutes O
until O
coming O
to O
us O
again, O
ordered, O
ordered O
brought O
literally O
in O
15 O
minutes, O
it O
was O
pleased, O
with O
full O
loading O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
prepared O
everything O
quickly, O
eat O
wanted O
very O
much)) O

I O
didn’t O
take O
empty O
plates O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
I O
didn’t O
notice O
an O
empty O
cup O
of O
coffee O
at O
all, O
I O
took O
the O
plates, O
but O
left O
all O
the O
dirty O
utensils, O
then O
I O
generally O
approached O
the O
table, O
took O
the O
sugar O
bar O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
neighboring O
table, O
there O
the O
men O
sat O
and O
drank O
tea, O
and O
no O
more O
so O
that O
my O
friend O
drank O
coffee O
and O
she O
needed O
sugar! O

It O
was O
strange, O
somewhere O
in O
the O
clouds.) O

But O
we O
are O
not O
frightened, O
we O
went O
and O
we O
will O
go O
to O
the O
Chatter!!! B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Everything O
was O
just O
great! O

Everyone O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
the B-TARGET
interior. I-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
administration B-TARGET
and O
staff O
of O
the B-TARGET
restaurant! I-TARGET

We O
always O
fulfilled O
our O
wishes O
and O
did O
everything O
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

The O
banquet O
menu O
was O
for O
4 O
t.p. O
- O
very O
much O
food O
per O
person O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
(in O
any O
case, O
hot B-TARGET
snacks I-TARGET
and O
second B-TARGET
dishes) I-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

On O
October O
18, O
he O
celebrated O
his O
birthday O
in O
Paberty. O

I O
ordered O
a O
banquet O
for O
15 O
people. O

We O
chose O
this O
restaurant, O
primarily O
because O
of O
its O
brewery, B-TARGET
and, O
as O
it O
turned O
out, O
a O
friend O
had O
a O
discount O
card O
of O
this O
institution O
:) O

The O
beer B-TARGET
here O
really O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
overwhelming, O
just O
above O
all O
praise! O

The O
first O
time O
I O
tried O
fresh B-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
now, O
probably, O
I O
will O
never O
be O
able O
to O
drink O
the O
usual O
bottle, O
and O
bottle O
- O
so O
much O
more O
:) O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
also O
delighted O
me. O

I O
ordered O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
- O
and O
snacks, B-TARGET
and O
hot... B-TARGET
I O
can O
not O
even O
highlight O
anything O
especially. O

Our O
table O
was O
served O
by O
several O
waiters B-TARGET
at O
once, O
so O
all O
the O
dishes O
and O
drinks O
were O
delivered O
very O
quickly, O
dirty O
dishes O
and O
ashes O
also O
disappeared O
from O
the O
table O
lightning O
and O
replaced O
with O
clean. O

Gentlemen, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
pity O
to O
leave O
for O
such O
service. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
entertainment I-TARGET
program I-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
also O
liked, O
not O
only O
drank O
- O
ate, O
but O
also O
danced, O
in O
short, O
it O
was O
fun O
:) O

I O
will O
summarize: O
the O
dust O
passed O
on O
Ura, O
I O
and O
my O
friends O
were O
crazyly O
pleased, O
for O
this O
huge O
thanks O
to O
all O

Service B-TARGET

a O
decent O
level. O

Somelye B-TARGET
was O
a O
nice O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
unobtrusively O
helped O
in O
the O
choice, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
polite, O
with O
his O
duties O
dealt O
out O
perfectly!) O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
delicious)the O
advertised O
saverma B-TARGET
was O
above O
all O
praise) O
I O
just O
recently O
wanted O
to O
eat O
it, O
but O
it O
was O
very O
frightening O
to O
buy O
in O
the O
bars O
near O
the O
subway, O
so O
I O
was O
happy O
with O
my O
choice)))the O
boys O
ate O
a O
vegetable O
salad O
with O
crabs O
and O
shrimp, O
beef O
steak O
with O
purple O
- O
the O
salad B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
the O
steak B-TARGET
is O
even O
better) O

And O
finally O
dessert, B-TARGET
almond B-TARGET
roulette... I-TARGET
I O
don’t O
know O
how O
to O
express O
it O
in O
words, O
but O
I’m O
writing O
and O
I’m O
already O
licking!!!! O

Unreal O
delicious O
roulette, B-TARGET
melting O
in O
the O
mouth, O
the O
highest O
pleasure!!! O

Please O
try O
it! O
😉 O
I O
want O
more! O
😉 O

I O
know O
this O
place O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
probably O
two O
years. O

This O
is O
still O
the O
best O
place B-TARGET
for O
me. O

Whenever O
I O
talk O
about O
meat, B-TARGET
I O
will O
definitely O
mention O
Abajur. B-TARGET

Meat B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
and O
I O
don’t O
even O
think O
of O
another O
establishment O
if O
I O
want O
to O
eat O
meat. O

But O
even O
with O
a O
great O
kitchen, B-TARGET
I’t O
have O
returned O
there O
if O
the O
waiter’s B-TARGET
conversation O
with O
the O
visitor O
wasn’t O
so O
emotional. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
know O
their O
business O
clearly, O
will O
tell O
about O
all O
the O
dishes, O
will O
give O
advice O
on O
what O
to O
choose, O
do O
not O
get O
dumb O
if O
you O
ask O
about O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
dish. O

And O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
for O
me, O
just O
nice O
people, B-TARGET
thank O
you O
guys. O

And O
it’s O
from O
the O
human O
attitude O
of O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
I’m O
glad O
to O
just O
go O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee O
in O
my O
free O
time. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
pleased O
with O
everything, O
I O
really O
like O
everything, O
not O
in O
vain O
I O
still O
consider O
this O
place B-TARGET
the O
best O
for O
myself. O

Remove O
the O
duck B-TARGET
from O
the O
menu. O

You O
must O
try O
it, O
it’s O
unhumanly O
delicious! O
(would O
be O
glad O
to O
see O
the O
cook O
and O
thank O
you) O

Take O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee, B-TARGET
of O
course. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
the O
lighting B-TARGET
is O
soft, O
the O
places B-TARGET
are O
convenient, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
well O
selected) O

What O
else O
can O
you O
add, O
I O
love O
the O
abajur.) B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
Empire B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
for O
a O
wonderful O
dinner! O

Everything O
was O
at O
the O
height: O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
interesting, O
and O
in O
life O
looks O
even O
better O
than O
in O
the O
photo O
(many O
sculptures, B-TARGET
interesting O
lamps, B-TARGET
large O
soft O
sofas), B-TARGET
polite O
and O
fast O
waiters, B-TARGET
calm O
music B-TARGET
(after O
20:00 O
live B-TARGET
performance I-TARGET
- O
it O
was O
interesting O
to O
listen O
to), O
and O
of O
course O
- O
very O
delicious O
food! B-TARGET

I O
would O
especially O
like O
to O
note O
steaks B-TARGET
(they O
are O
above O
all O
praise) O
and O
dessert B-TARGET
(we O
tried O
Almond B-TARGET
- O
prepared O
in O
the O
restaurant O
itself, O
indescribably O
delicious)! O

As O
a O
result, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
advise O
"Empire" B-TARGET
not O
only O
as O
a O
restaurant O
for O
celebrating O
weddings, O
birthdays O
(beautiful O
large O
halls, B-TARGET
comfortable O
dance B-TARGET
floor, I-TARGET
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
you O
will O
definitely O
like), O
but O
also O
as O
a O
place O
with O
a O
cozy O
romantic O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
great O
Friday O
night! O

We O
will O
definitely O
visit O
you O
again! O

A O
very O
good O
coffee!! B-TARGET

He O
celebrated O
his O
birthday O
with O
his O
friends. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful O
- O
delicious O
and O
abundant O
food, B-TARGET
great O
dishes, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
polite O
administrator B-TARGET
Alexander. O

A O
small O
cozy O
cafe. B-TARGET

Very O
low O
prices O
(and O
this O
given O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
place O
is O
on O
Nevsky O
Prospect). O

I’m O
not O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
I’m O
always O
very O
happy. O

Very O
delicious O
hatchapuri B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese, I-TARGET
delicious O
salmon B-TARGET
(a O
piece B-TARGET
is O
very O
large O
and O
saturated). O

A O
lot O
of O
other O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

My O
friends O
decided O
to O
come O
here O
again. O

If O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
disadvantages: O
Minus, O
one: O
Not O
very O
beautiful O
entourage B-TARGET
below. O

At O
least O
I O
do O
not O
like O
it O
very O
much. O

Probably O
for O
the O
amateur. O

Everything O
is O
great O
on O
the O
top B-TARGET
floor!! I-TARGET

You O
can O
sing O
karaoke B-TARGET
here. O

There O
is O
a O
very O
delicious O
calcium. B-TARGET

In O
general, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
all O
those O
who O
want O
to O
enjoy O
a O
delicious, O
healthy O
and O
not O
very O
expensive O
holiday O
or O
just O
sit O
together O
in O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Very O
very O
pleased!! O

It O
was O
the O
second O
time O
I O
celebrated O
my O
birthday O
in O
Palermo. O

No O
prior O
reservation O
of O
the O
table O
(thought O
that O
a O
free O
table O
would O
be). O

We O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
there O
were O
free O
tables, O
but O
there O
were O
few. O

We O
met O
gladly, O
a O
large O
bouquet O
was O
placed O
in O
a O
large O
vase. O

Helped O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
table. O

They O
offered O
bread O
to O
choose O
from O
(in O
the O
evening O
the O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
repeatedly O
approached O
and O
offered O
bread O
"as O
you O
wish") O
and O
three O
types O
of O
oils. O

The O
evening O
at O
the O
Palkin O
restaurant O
was O
held O
in O
a O
refined O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
created O
by O
polite O
and O
attentive O
staff. B-TARGET

We O
served O
carefully O
and O
unnoticed, O
although O
there O
were O
many O
guests, O
both O
our O
and O
foreigners. O

The O
meals O
were O
served O
to O
our O
guests O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

Compliments B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
chef, I-TARGET
salads, B-TARGET
snacks, B-TARGET
hot B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
original O
and O
great. O

And O
what O
a O
show B-TARGET
we O
were O
shown O
by O
two O
young O
people, O
busy O
preparing O
the O
ordered O
dessert, O
right O
in O
the O
hall O
in O
front O
of O
our O
table. O

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
restaurant O
staff B-TARGET
for O
a O
wonderful O
evening. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
wedding O
was O
wonderful, O
the O
mood O
was O
broken O
here! O

All O
in O
order, O
the O
banquet O
menu O
2000 O
per O
person, O
the O
matter O
was O
not O
in O
the O
price, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
see O
a O
rich O
table, O
the O
administrator O
assured O
that O
this O
was O
quite O
enough, O
although O
we O
had O
a O
menu O
for O
18 O
people, O
and O
two O
could O
not O
come O
and O
the O
order O
amount O
was O
more O
than O
2000 O
per O
person O
and O
still O
food B-TARGET
was O
little! O

Funny O
looking O
6 O
small O
pieces O
of O
red B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
on O
a O
healthy O
dish, O
etc. O

I O
understand O
the O
beautiful O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
of O
the O
table, O
but O
don’t O
mistake O
guests O
with O
6 O
roulettes B-TARGET
on O
a O
huge O
plate! O

I'm O
already O
silent O
that O
they O
take O
10% O
for O
service, B-TARGET
and O
we O
only O
had O
1 O
waitress, B-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
alcohol O
on O
the O
table O
and O
he O
alone O
obviously O
didn't O
have O
time O
to O
pour O
everyone, O
in O
the O
end, O
the O
guests O
sat O
with O
empty O
glasses! O

He O
alone O
did O
not O
have O
time O
to O
serve O
everyone O
at O
the O
same O
time O
hot O
and O
dessert, O
as O
a O
result, O
the O
tea O
had O
already O
cooled, O
by O
the O
time O
the O
dessert O
was O
sunny! O

Recently O
they O
were O
at O
a O
wedding O
with O
friends, O
they O
had O
2000 O
per O
person O
without O
any O
service O
(tea O
on O
request), O
the O
table O
broke O
from O
food O
and O
much O
remains! O

It O
may O
be O
good O
for O
dinner O
here, O
but O
the O
banquet O
is O
definitely O
not O
worth O
doing O
here! O

Do O
not O
ruin O
the O
party! O

Good O
night! O

We O
were O
with O
friends O
on O
the O
wedding O
anniversary O
(10 O
years) O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Specially O
registered O
to O
leave O
a O
review O
about O
the O
banquet, O
because O
I O
really O
liked O
it O
here! O

The O
hall B-TARGET
is O
very O
bright, O
cozy, O
there O
is O
a O
hotel O
area O
where O
you O
could O
sit O
and O
relax O
from O
dancing. O

Danced B-TARGET
all I-TARGET
night! I-TARGET

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
from O
friends, O
they O
were O
advised O
by O
the O
host B-TARGET
and O
the O
musician, B-TARGET
it O
was O
great! O

Very O
fun, O
good O
music, B-TARGET
competitions B-TARGET
for O
young O
people O
and O
for O
adults! O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
especially O
liked O
beef B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
and O
seafood B-TARGET
salad! I-TARGET

My O
wife O
is O
also O
delighted. O

She O
ate O
fish O
with O
some O
white O
sauce O
and O
baked O
potatoes. O

The O
table B-TARGET
was O
covered O
really O
beautifully. O

Large O
plates, B-TARGET
richly O
decorated, O
although O
the O
guys O
who O
ordered O
the O
banquet O
said O
the O
prices O
were O
moderate. O

Now O
I O
am O
preparing O
my O
anniversary O
here O
too, O
and O
my O
daughter O
is O
thinking O
about O
the O
wedding. O

Very O
good O
guys, O
thank O
you O
very O
much! O

I O
want O
to O
express O
a O
huge O
thanks O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
Bravo-Laudes I-TARGET
and O
a O
special O
thanks O
to O
its O
owner B-TARGET
Michael!!! O

Our O
wedding O
was O
held O
on O
24.08.13, O
the O
restaurant O
was O
advised O
by O
friends. O

When O
we O
first O
came O
there, O
we O
immediately O
felt O
that O
this O
was O
the O
place B-TARGET
where O
our O
wedding O
was O
supposed O
to O
take O
place. O

Michael O
told O
us O
everything O
in O
detail, O
helped O
to O
decide O
everything. O

We O
celebrated O
in O
the O
big B-TARGET
hall, I-TARGET
it O
was O
decorated O
simply O
elegantly O
with O
fountains B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
balls, I-TARGET
hearts O
hanging O
from O
the O
ceiling, O
everything O
was O
in B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
tones, I-TARGET
and O
about O
our O
place O
I O
am O
already O
silent, O
lighting, B-TARGET
elegant O
flowers B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
table, O
in O
general O
all O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
was O
elegant, O
every O
chair B-TARGET
was O
decorated. O

We O
ordered O
the O
cake O
and O
we O
brought O
it O
all. O

The O
guests O
were O
ordered O
a O
cupcake. O

As O
for O
the O
menu, O
we O
ordered O
2150 O
per O
person, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
so O
huge O
that O
we O
ate O
three O
more O
days. O

Our O
guests O
still O
remember O
that O
such O
delicious O
food O
they O
have O
not O
eaten O
once O
in O
their O
lives, O
and O
even O
after O
two O
days O
of O
salads B-TARGET
remained O
fresh!!!!! O

They O
have O
no O
words O
to O
say!! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
great!! O

Everyone O
did O
not O
noticeably, O
it O
gave O
the O
impression O
that O
they O
were O
not O
at O
all. O

In O
general, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
great, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
celebrate O
your O
wedding, O
I O
recommend O
Bravo-Laudes!!!!! B-TARGET

You O
will O
not O
regret!! O

Nice O
Italian O
restaurant B-TARGET
without O
complaints. O

Of O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
only O
that O
long O
awaited O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
from O
the O
menu. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
simple O
both O
inside O
and O
outside. O

From O
the O
dishes O
ordered O
tomato O
soup, O
risotto O
with O
white O
mushrooms, O
pasta O
with O
shrimp O
and O
Caesar. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
were O
large O
enough; O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
but O
Caesar B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
chicken O
was O
very O
upset, O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
unpleasant O
with O
the O
smell O
of O
fish. O

A O
good O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
delicious O
meal O
of O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
at O
a O
moderate O
price. O

We O
were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
in O
April. O

Good O
impressions O
remain. O

It O
started O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
came O
there O
on O
Saturday, O
the O
hall O
was O
full, O
there O
were O
no O
places. O

I O
was O
upset. O

Standing O
in O
front O
of O
the O
bar O
with O
a O
friend, O
waiting O
for O
a O
common O
friend O
to O
decide O
where O
to O
go O
and O
where O
to O
go. O

We O
waited O
10 O
minutes O
and O
only O
he O
came, O
as O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
came O
out O
to O
us O
and O
polently O
offered O
a O
booked O
table, O
explaining O
that O
we O
can O
sit O
there O
until O
the O
“masters” O
appear O
(to O
our O
joy, O
they O
never O
announced). O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
polite O
and O
orders O
are O
delivered O
quickly. O

Prices O
are O
very O
reasonable, O
especially O
for O
beer. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
tasty. O

It O
was O
pleasant, O
standing O
in O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
piano, B-TARGET
you O
could O
come O
and O
play O
it=) O

In O
general, O
we O
remained O
very O
satisfied. O

We O
celebrated O
a O
friend’s O
birthday O
here. O

Very O
pleased! O

The O
magnificent O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
bay O
from O
the O
window, O
the O
blue-white O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
hall O
create O
a O
feeling O
of O

and O
cleanliness. O

Excellent O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
cozy O
and O

(including O
in O
the O

On O
September O
6, O
2013, O
we O
were O
at O
dinner O
at O
the O
Puri O
restaurant. O

Selected O
by O
location O
and O
focused O
on O
the O
feedback O
of O
visitors. O

I O
ordered O
a O
table O
by O
phone. O

We O
met O
a O
beautiful O
girl B-TARGET
administrator, I-TARGET
guided O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
just O
wonderful. O

Interesting O
interior, B-TARGET
all O
colorful O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very O
home O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

We O
were O
served O
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

Andrei O
was O
a O
very O
good O
waitress, B-TARGET
for O
which O
I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
him. O

He O
gave O
us O
enough O
time O
and O
was O
not O
obsessive. O

We O
recommended O
a O
great O
tea, B-TARGET
which O
we O
were O
delighted O
with. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
very O
diverse. O

I O
ordered O
quickly. O

Everything O
is O
delicious. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
friends O
and O
acquaintances. O

There O
was O
a O
desire O
to O
visit O
other O
institutions O
of O
the O
Ginza O
network. O

I O
haven’t O
been O
here O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
although O
I’m O
very O
close. O

I O
think O
there O
have O
been O
changes O
for O
the O
better. O

At O
the O
entrance O
are O
polite O
welcomes, O
offer O
a O
room O
for O
smokers O
and O
non-smokers. O

Just O
sit O
at O
the O
table O
chosen O
by O
me, O
the O
menu O
right O
on O
the O
table, O
just O
choose. O

I O
picked O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
here. O

A O
cup O
of O
green O
tea O
with O
jasmine O
did O
not O
wait. O

They O
quickly O
cooked. O

I O
ordered O
rice O
and O
a O
roll O
of O
rainbow. O

I O
ate O
the O
first O
dish O
and O
immediately O
brought O
the O
second. O

It O
is O
wonderful. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
from O
the O
novelty O
that O
my O
table O
served O
not O
one O
waitress O
as O
often O
happens, O
but O
a O
group, O
at O
the O
moment O
less O
busy. O

From O
this, O
the O
speed O
of O
serving B-TARGET
meals I-TARGET
and O
my O
mood O
clearly O
improved. O

The O
calculation O
was O
also O
quick. O

Say O
goodbye O
at O
the O
exit. O

The O
desire O
to O
come O
here O
appeared. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
in O
the O
mass O
of O
their O
men, O
as O
they O
say O
this O
is O
a O
sushi O
chip, O
allowing O
to O
increase O
the O
speed O
of O
service. O

It O
works, O
it O
really O
works. O

What O
else O
the O
institution O
needs O
to O
work O
on O
is O
over O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
it O
is O
not O
yet O
at O
the O
level O
of O
service. B-TARGET

I O
can’t O
help O
but O
tell O
you O
how O
the O
banquet O
went O
on O
my O
wedding. O

So O
when O
we O
arrived O
the O
snacks B-TARGET
were O
ready, O
everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
as O
it O
should O
be. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
did O
everything O
clearly. O

The O
glasses O
were O
full O
and O
the O
plates O
were O
empty. O

We O
ordered O
the O
menu. O

After O
the O
order O
passed O
about O
half O
an O
hour, O
or O
maybe O
more, O
when O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
approached O
me O
and O
said O
that O
there O
is O
no O
light O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
and O
you O
need O
to O
make O
another O
order O
for O
hot O
(on O
coal). O

After O
the O
wedding O
and O
walking O
around O
the O
city, O
as O
you O
understand, O
guests O
are O
always O
hungry. O

Yes, O
snacks O
somehow O
mitigated O
the O
desire O
to O
eat, O
but O
not O
enough O
to O
wait O
another O
hour. O

There O
was O
nothing O
to O
do, O
everyone O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table O
again O
and O
began O
to O
choose O
other O
dishes, O
after O
20 O
minutes O
another O
order O
was O
made. O

And O
after O
30 O
minutes O
it O
became O
quite O
funny O
when O
the O
administrator O
approached O
me O
and O
said O
that O
there O
would O
be O
no O
hot O
on O
coal. O

The O
original O
order O
will O
be O
executed. O

Nothing O
could O
ruin O
my O
mood O
that O
day. O

After O
15 O
minutes, O
our O
order O
appeared O
on O
the O
table. O

Then O
it O
was O
no O
matter, O
the O
main O
thing O
to O
feed O
the O
guests, O
well, O
yourself) O

The O
cake. O

the O
ordered O
in O
advance O
(Napoleon) B-TARGET
did O
not O
meet O
my O
expectations, O
well, O
the O
taste O
and O
color O
of O
the O
comrade O
is O
not. O

As O
for O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
it O
is O
very O
suitable O
for O
celebrations, O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
work O
with O
a O
photographer O
in O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
VIP O
room. O

I O
recommend, O
but O
apparently O
all O
the O
kitchen O
should O
be O
ordered O
in O
advance. O

Good O
day! O

It O
was O
celebrated O
yesterday O
in O
this O
institution, O
Dr. O
Anniversary. O

My O
family O
and O
I O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
time O
spent O
at O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
delicious, O
quite O
a O
good O
choice O
of O
dishes, B-TARGET
the O
price O
is O
more O
than O
consistent O
with O
the O
quality. O

Very O
pleasant O
and O
unobtrusive O
service. B-TARGET

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
they O
brought O
a O
compliment O
from O
the O
restaurant O
as O
a O
large O
meal O
with O
fruits. O

I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
note O
that O
despite O
the O
fairly O
large O
crowd O
of O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
you O
do O
not O
feel O
discomfort, O
in O
the O
feelings O
resembles O
a O
real O
Italian O
restaurant. O

Good O
day! O

We O
were O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
two O
weeks O
ago O
at O
the O
restaurant O
"Olivia", O
just O
now O
decided O
to O
write O
a O
review. O

So O
the O
memories O
were O
a O
little O
dull, O
but O
I O
still O
wanted O
to O
share O
the O
impressions!)) O

We O
came O
there O
on O
Friday O
evening O
and O
strangely O
enough, O
the O
people O
were O
very O
few, O
which O
in O
principle O
pleased O
us, O
as O
we O
could O
choose O
any O
table O
we O
liked O
without O
any O
problems. O

At O
the O
entrance O
met O
a O
friendly O
waitress, B-TARGET
immediately O
conducted O
to O
the O
table, O
even O
had O
time O
to O
exchange O
a O
couple O
of O
jokes O
with O
him) O

Lovely O
interior, B-TARGET
very O
even O
has O
for O
pleasant O
conversations O
and O
a O
good O
time! O

Now O
about O
the O
most O
pleasant, O
about O
food. B-TARGET

It O
was O
delicious, O
very O
homemade O
and O
you O
know, O
you O
can O
even O
say O
cooked O
with O
love)) O

We O
ordered O
calves O
of O
calf O
with O
puré, O
hatchapuri O
and O
two O
glasses O
of O
white O
wine. O

Kottletki B-TARGET
sweetest, O
pure O
delicious, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
warm, O
hatchapuri B-TARGET
surpassed O
all O
expectations, O
eaten O
in O
two O
minutes))) O

In O
general, O
we O
stayed O
very O
happy, O
I O
think O
I O
will O
definitely O
come O
there O
to O
try O
the O
salad B-TARGET
"Olivier" I-TARGET
)) O

Everyone O
was O
not O
going O
to O
write O
a O
review O
about O
this O
beautiful O
and O
wonderful O
restaurant. B-TARGET

She O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
in O
the O
most O
beautiful O
hall. B-TARGET

Very O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
all O
the O
guests O
noted O
it. O

The O
table O
just O
broke O
from O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
very O
delicious O
and O
decently O
decorated, O
although O
the O
menu B-TARGET
cost O
me O
in O
reasonable O
money, O
alcohol O
was O
my O
own. O

Yes, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
highlight O
the O
organization O
of O
my O
celebration O
and O
the O
work B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters. O

There O
was O
no O
need O
to O
call O
anyone O
specifically O
/ O
wait, O
they O
themselves O
noticed O
what O
was O
lacking, O
what O
to O
bring, O
who O
to O
pour))) O

You O
guys B-TARGET
are O
great! O

With O
us O
was O
the O
manager O
of O
another O
restaurant O
and O
she O
was O
very O
good O
about O
the O
work O
and O
employees B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

I O
was O
also O
very O
surprised O
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
everyone O
offered O
me O
to O
pack O
in O
bags. O

Keep O
it O
so! O

Thank O
you O
for O
a O
wonderful O
celebration. O

A O
special O
thanks O
to O
the O
manager B-TARGET
Julia, O
she O
helped O
me O
make O
the O
menu O
so O
that O
my O
guests O
were O
satisfied. O

It O
feels O
professional O
😉 O

03.09.2014 O
celebrated O
in O
the O
restaurant O
"Favourite" O
birthday O
of O
the O
beloved. O

The O
dinner O
was O
on O
the O
third O
floor. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
interesting. O

The O
service B-TARGET
staff, I-TARGET
of O
course, O
ruined O
the O
entire O
holiday O
evening O
personally O
for O
us O
and O
our O
friends. O

First, O
during O
the O
service, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
Anastasia O
dropped O
the O
dirty O
utensils O
on O
the O
guest. O

Secondly, O
she O
constantly O
took O
the O
dishes O
in O
which O
there O
was O
still O
food, O
and O
left O
the O
empty O
dishes O
on O
the O
table. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
ordering O
water O
brought O
her O
in O
20 O
minutes, O
while O
saying O
that O
she O
had O
been O
eating O
all O
that O
time, O
she O
had O
no O
time. O

The O
men O
ordered O
a O
bottle O
of O
tequila, O
lemon O
and O
salt. O

Everything O
was O
brought O
separately, O
with O
a O
time O
difference O
of O
10 O
minutes. O

What O
surprised O
me O
very O
much. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

There O
are O
restaurants O
in O
St. O
Petersburg O
that O
are O
much O
better O
and O
affordable O
in O
terms O
of O
price O
and O
quality O
of O
service. O

I O
am O
a O
regular O
visitor O
to O
this O
cafe. O

It O
has O
recently O
been O
repaired O
and O
now O
it O
is O
bright O
and O
cozy. O

We O
love O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
we O
often O
go O
there O
with O
friends O
and O
celebrate O
holidays O
there. O

Service B-TARGET
at O
a O
high O
level, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
working O
very O
well O
and O
always O
attentive O
to O
the O
guests. O

I O
recommend O
this O
cafe B-TARGET
both O
for O
those O
who O
just O
want O
to O
drink O
coffee O
in O
a O
quiet O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
and O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
or O
some O
other O
holiday. O

It O
was O
this O
Saturday. O

They O
went O
with O
a O
great O
mood, O
left O
with O
an O
impression O
on O
the O
three. O

The O
best O
room B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
made O
for O
smokers. O

In O
other O
words, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
look O
at O
the O
Neva O
and O
the O
Hermitage, O
breathe O
smoke. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
pleased O
either. O

Or O
the O
same O
as O
in O
Hocuharcho, O
Mamalagh, O
etc., O
or O
something O
of O
the O
middle O
level O
at O
a O
high O
price. O

They O
took: O
- O
Cheburek B-TARGET
- O
the O
child O
ate, O
remained O
satisfied O
- O
carpacho B-TARGET
sibasa I-TARGET
- O
so O
for O
themselves, O
little O
- O
taste O
strange O
- O
steak B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tuna I-TARGET
- O
also O
so O
for O
themselves, O
regretted O
that O
took. O
- O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
crab I-TARGET
- O
so O
for O
themselves, O
- O
sheep B-TARGET
sheep O
- O
normally O
- O
baked O
cheese O
- O
brought O
a O
little O
warm O
- O
chocolate B-TARGET
box I-TARGET
- O
the O
child O
liked O
- O
coconut B-TARGET
shots I-TARGET
- O
delicious O
Service B-TARGET
too O
obsessive, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
approached O
every O
2 O
minutes, O
while O
the O
table O
was O
not O
watched. O

Probably O
inexperienced O
and O
trying O
too O
hard. O

I O
don’t O
think O
we O
will O
be O
gathered O
here O
anymore. O

I O
will O
write O
the O
conclusion O
immediately: O
friendly, O
delicious O
and O
pleasant. O

On O
Saturday O
evening O
there O
were O
enough O
free O
seats O
to O
choose O
the O
one O
you O
liked. O

There O
are O
also O
comfortable O
couches B-TARGET
and O
a O
round O
table O
for O
a O
large O
company. O

The B-TARGET
bartender I-TARGET
of O
this O
establishment)) O

The O
order O
was O
received O
quickly, O
and O
I O
brought O
it O
too. O

Lemonade, O
then O
salad, O
then O
steak, O
then O
coffee. O

I O
didn’t O
have O
to O
sit O
on O
an O
empty O
plate. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
no O
comments. O

The O
steak B-TARGET
was O
exactly O
a O
steak, O
not O
a O
piece O
of O
fried O
meat. O

Good O
equipment, B-TARGET
new O
dishes, B-TARGET
a O
positive O
interior. B-TARGET

I O
want O
to O
sit O
there O
longer. O

The O
check O
was O
for O
860 O
rubles. O
imho O
it O
is O
even O
cheap! O

Coffee O
was O
a O
gift. O

I O
have O
not O
been O
out O
of O
the O
house B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
I O
am O
so O
pleased. O

I O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
for O
the O
dessert, O
I O
highly O
recommend O
you! O

I O
came O
to O
this O
restaurant O
by O
chance. O

It O
makes O
a O
pretty O
good O
impression, O
but... O

Service B-TARGET
is O
disgusting. O

For O
10 O
minutes O
we O
waited O
for O
someone O
to O
come O
and O
bring O
a O
menu. O

Then O
another O
15 O
minutes O
tried O
to O
order, O
everyone O
was O
not O
up O
to O
us. O

When O
ordered, O
they O
asked O
how O
long O
those O
or O
other O
dishes O
would O
be O
prepared, O
and O
in O
the O
end, O
because O
the O
time O
was O
not O
enough, O
they O
ordered O
Caesar O
and O
Mors O
for O
me, O
and O
pasta, O
pins O
and O
Mors O
for O
my O
husband. O

After O
30 O
minutes, O
they O
brought O
me O
a O
salad, O
another O
minute O
after O
10 O
- O
blenders. O

When O
I O
asked O
about O
the O
morse O
and O
the O
bread, O
10 O
minutes O
later, O
I O
only O
got O
the O
morse. O

Time O
pushed O
up O
was O
no O
longer O
to O
the O
paste, O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
bill, O
which O
was O
brought O
immediately. O

We O
still O
waited O
10 O
minutes O
for O
the O
pasta O
to O
be O
brought, O
but O
apparently O
it O
was O
not O
the O
fate O
to O
eat O
it. O

They O
paid O
for O
everything O
(and O
the O
pasta O
too) O
and O
left. O

From O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
had O
time O
to O
try, O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
so O
there O
are O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
something. O

Go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
only O
when O
you O
have O
3-4 O
hours O
in O
stock, O
otherwise O
you O
will O
not O
have O
time O
anywhere. O

We O
only O
had O
1.5 O
hours, O
but O
all O
that O
we O
ordered O
was O
not O
eaten O
unfortunately. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Overall O
I O
liked O
it! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
fresh O
and O
delicious, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
friendly, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
very O
interesting, O
especially O
everyone O
was O
struck O
by O
the O
toilet B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
aquariums! I-TARGET

Very O
good O
location B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
centre O
of O
the O
city, O
with O
beautiful O
views B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window! O

But O
for O
our O
children's O
holiday O
we O
did O
not O
have O
a O
chair, O
although O
the O
day O
before O
we O
talked O
about O
it O
and O
told O
us O
that O
we O
would O
not O
have O
any O
problems! O

As O
a O
result, O
one O
was O
put O
with O
grief O
in O
half, O
and O
the O
other O
sat O
the O
whole O
banquet O
on O
the O
fingers O
(and O
then O
apparently O
they O
did O
not O
stand O
and O
left O
with O
the O
child O
early O
without O
waiting O
for O
hot O
(their O
hot O
ones, O
by O
the O
way, O
did O
not O
be O
wrapped O
with O
us) O
and O
some O
guests O
did O
not O
like O
that O
the O
food O
was O
placed O
in O
plates.. O
since O
many O
did O
not O
eat O
all... O

These O
were O
the O
only O
shortcomings O
of O
our O
celebration. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
banquet! O

At O
the O
end, O
we O
all O
wrapped O
up O
with O
us O
and O
gave O
us O
drinks, O
no O
alcohol O
remains. O

Recently O
came O
by O
company, O
have O
not O
been O
in O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
would O
rather O
not O
come!!!! O

It O
was O
a O
Friday, O
people O
in O
the O
room B-TARGET
under O
a O
curtain, O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
only O
free O
table, O
so O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
so O
close O
that O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
get O
out O
of O
it O
(but O
this O
is O
not O
the O
most O
terrible... O

For O
a O
very O
long O
time, O
they O
carry O
an O
order O
or O
generally O
forget O
about O
you, O
all O
the O
time O
come O
and O
ask O
(well O
if O
you O
have O
a O
bad O
memory O
- O
take O
a O
paper O
and O
write O
it O
down). O

We O
took O
hot, O
salads, O
beer O
and O
snacks O
for O
beer, O
which O
never O
waited, O
although O
after O
an O
hour O
1 O
time O
even O
reminded O
us O
what O
we O
should O
not O
do O
in O
principle. O

But O
they O
have O
not O
forgotten O
about O
it!! O

Salads O
were O
better O
before. O

Food O
brings O
traits O
like, O
first, O
without O
devices, O
all O
the O
time O
you O
need O
to O
remind, O
in O
the O
second, O
in O
time O
terrible, O
1 O
of O
us O
has O
already O
eaten O
for O
an O
hour, O
and O
the O
second O
has O
not O
even O
started O
cooking O
apparently. O

You O
can’t O
wait O
for O
the B-TARGET
waiter, I-TARGET
you O
haven’t O
yet O
eaten, O
the O
plate O
is O
taken O
away. O

There O
is O
a O
gallery O
in O
the O
room, B-TARGET
music B-TARGET
is O
not O
heard O
at O
all. O

We O
used O
to O
go O
to O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
with O
pleasure, O
what O
happened O
- O
I O
don't O
understand. O

No O
more O
feet!! O

The O
price O
of O
the O
beer O
restaurant O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
the O
cheap O
train O
station((((( O

We O
want O
to O
express O
you O
a O
huge O
thank O
you!!!!July O
17 O
celebrated O
your O
wedding O
in O
the O
new O
hall O
on O
the O
Gallery!!! O

Everyone O
is O
very O
pleased!! O

Great, O
beautiful O
hall, B-TARGET
polite O
waiters, B-TARGET
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
no O
conflicts O
and O
objections O
from O
the O
staff!!! B-TARGET

We O
decided O
to O
book O
your O
restaurant O
very O
quickly. O

There O
are O
plenty O
of O
places, B-TARGET
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
good, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
decorate O
the O
room B-TARGET
at O
all! O

When O
in O
other O
restaurants O
you O
need O
to O
spend O
a O
bunch O
of O
money O
to O
close O
the O
terrible O
walls O
and O
make O
the O
likeness O
of O
a O
holiday!) O

It O
was O
great O
that O
you O
had O
your O
own O
candy, B-TARGET
the O
prices O
were O
the O
same, O
and O
the O
cake B-TARGET
was O
the O
most O
delicious!!! O

And O
you O
do O
not O
need O
to O
order O
somewhere, O
worry O
about O
delivery, O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
cake O
will O
break O
down O
on O
the O
road! O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
kind! O
approached, O
asked O
if O
everything O
was O
good, O
what O
was O
better O
to O
bring, O
there O
were O
no O
empty O
bottles O
and O
dirty O
towels O
on O
the O
table! O

Everything O
was O
just O
great!! O

After O
the O
celebration O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
food O
and O
alcohol. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
gathered O
everything O
and O
gave O
us, O
up O
to O
our O
begun O
bottles O
of O
wine! O

In O
traditional O
restaurants O
you O
will O
rarely O
encounter O
it. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
Valentine!! O

Very O
helpful O
with O
the O
menu O
and O
wedding O
cake! O

And O
in O
general, O
will O
tell O
you O
what O
and O
how O
to O
do O
it O
best, O
will O
take O
into O
account O
all O
preferences! O

I O
didn’t O
worry O
about O
anything O
either O
before O
the O
wedding O
or O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
wedding. O

More O
thankful O
customers!! O

This O
is O
the O
place B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
a O
wedding!! O

Ura O
Ura O
Ura! O

With O
the O
best O
wishes, O
Andrei O

Ekaterina O
Malashok!!! O

I O
have O
known O
this O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time, O
almost O
2 O
years O
- O
I O
have O
always O
been O
here O
on O
holidays, O
if O
I O
was O
near O
the O
CPCIO. O

In O
recent O
times, O
a O
lot O
has O
changed O
here O
- O
before O
it O
was O
just O
a O
quiet O
restaurant O
of O
good O
French O
cuisine, O
now O
they O
have O
become O
more O
active. O

We O
tried O
to O
celebrate O
our O
daughter’s O
birthday. O

For O
us, O
of O
course, O
it O
is O
expensive, O
but O
I O
always O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
this O
place O
and O
the O
delicious O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Here O
for O
the O
children O
there O
is O
their O
own O
menu, B-TARGET
room B-TARGET
and O
the O
opportunity O
to O
arrange O
a O
good O
fun O
program. B-TARGET

The O
animators B-TARGET
were O
great O
and O
arranged O
a O
real O
celebration O
for O
the O
children. O

It O
went O
very O
well. O

Another O
of O
my O
personal O
advantages O
is O
a O
great O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

It O
was O
time O
for O
me O
to O
say O
thank O
you O
very O
much. O

Price O
above O
average. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
twice. O

The O
first O
time O
worked O
a O
good O
waitress B-TARGET
- O
everything O
friendly O
and O
fast. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
does O
not O
reach O
the O
Italian O
– O
except O
the O
size O
of O
the O
portion. O

But O
quite O
edible. O

The O
second O
visit O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
very O
disappointing. O

They O
decided O
to O
check O
whether O
good O
business O
lunches O
were O
as O
they O
were O
said. O

Disappointment O
number O
times O
- O
you O
can O
only O
order O
a O
business O
lunch O
while O
sitting O
inside O
the O
room. O

The O
chairs O
on O
the O
street O
for O
some O
reason O
(???) O
are O
not O
intended O
for O
this. O

Oh O
well O
ok. O

relocated O
) O

In O
the O
room B-TARGET
it O
is O
hot O
in O
the O
summer. O

very O
very. O

Since O
we O
did O
not O
find O
the O
Brioni O
and O
Lanjin, O
they O
first O
began O
to O
serve O
those O
who O
brought O
these O
delights O
on O
themselves. O

Well, O
order O
one O
business O
lunch O
if O
you O
can’t O
come O
together O
(???) O

That O
is, O
when O
the O
other O
just O
has O
no O
appetite O
or O
a O
portion O
for O
one O
is O
very O
large? O

And O
all O
this O
was O
accompanied O
by O
the O
superb O
expression O
of O
the O
waitress’ B-TARGET
face. O

The O
Conclusion. O

We O
previously O
recommended O
friends O
to O
visit O
this O
restaurant O
and O
wanted O
to O
become O
everyday O
ones. O

And O
now O
we O
will O
answer O
our O
friends O
and O
we O
will O
not O
go O
ourselves. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
an O
Italian O
name. O

Anyone O
who O
has O
been O
to O
Italy O
will O
understand. O

There O
are O
much O
more O
decent O
establishments O
in O
Peter O
with O
Italian O
cuisine O
and O
better O
service. O

Those O
guys O
still O
have O
to O
go O
through. O

Everything O
is O
decided O
by O
people O
on O
the O
ground. O

And O
if O
the O
manager O
of O
this O
restaurant O
reads O
my O
review, O
let O
it O
take O
note. O

by O
Avs. O

We O
celebrated O
the O
wedding O
in O
Belcanto O
on O
Malohytinsky O
05.07.2013. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
just O
amazing! O

To O
say O
what O
we O
liked O
is O
not O
to O
say O
anything! O
:) O

Royal B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
flowers I-TARGET
near O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
exquisite O
interior B-TARGET
inside O
the O
restaurant. O

Great O
service, B-TARGET
lots O
of O
food B-TARGET
on O
the O
table. O

They O
took O
the O
menu O
for O
1900, O
although O
everyone O
ate O
actively, O
but, O
no O
matter O
what, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
left O
(everything O
was O
packed O
with O
them). O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
polite O
and O
unobtrusive, O
excellent O
service! B-TARGET

They O
were O
afraid O
that O
there O
would O
be O
little O
space O
(there O
were O
46 O
people), O
but O
as O
a O
result O
there O
was O
no O
tightness, O
and O
there O
was O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
space B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
dancing.) I-TARGET

In O
general, O
there O
was O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
do, O
and O
all O
the O
guests O
were O
delighted O
with O
the O
evening O
spent O
there. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much!! O

I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
good O
service. O

There O
were O
4 O
times O
of O
them O
only O
1 O
time O
normally O
served: O
1 O
time O
did O
not O
give O
the O
menu, O
very O
long O
carried O
the O
drinks; O
2 O
times O
did O
not O
bring O
the O
salad, O
but O
included O
in O
the O
account; O
3 O
times O
in O
general O
epic O
file O
- O
ham O
and O
careless O
attitude B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters... O

There O
is O
no O
menu O
on O
the O
table O
while O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
approaches O
and O
asks, O
"What O
did O
you O
choose?" O

After O
that, O
we O
were O
given O
a O
lunch O
menu O
(the O
usual O
menu O
is O
visible O
only O
one O
for O
the O
entire O
restaurant). O

After O
that, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
went O
away O
and O
did O
not O
approach O
the O
table O
anymore, O
waiting O
10 O
minutes, O
they O
called O
another. O

I O
received O
my O
order O
in O
3 O
minutes. O

Instead O
of O
the O
ordered O
soup O
brought O
another, O
after O
2 O
minutes. O

Drinks O
brought O
only O
after O
dessert O
(after O
request O
to O
bring O
drinks!!!!). O

Terrible O
in O
one O
word. O

Yes, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
great, O
ketalonian B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
is O
a O
miracle. O

But O
where O
do O
those O
waiters B-TARGET
get??? O

Honestly, O
an O
unpleasant O
impression, O
I O
thought O
everything O
changed, O
no=( O

I O
would O
like O
to O
share O
with O
all O
the O
users O
of O
the O
site O
a O
review O
about O
Duplex O
restaurant. O

This O
restaurant O
we O
chose O
to O
celebrate O
the O
wedding O
holiday O
dinner O
in O
the O
circle O
of O
friends O
and O
relatives. O

Before O
visiting O
this O
restaurant, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
evaluate O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes O
and O
look O
at O
the O
interior. O

Since O
the O
celebration O
was O
planned O
for O
25 O
people, O
space B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
our I-TARGET
guests I-TARGET
was O
quite O
enough O
for O
dancing O
in O
particular. O

Manager B-TARGET
Alexey, O
who O
accepted O
our O
order O
and O
signed O
the O
contract, O
held O
the O
whole O
event O
himself, O
which O
very O
pleased O
us. O

In O
the O
menu O
we O
chose O
a O
variety O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
they O
were O
all O
very O
delicious. O

The O
table B-TARGET
was O
rich O
and O
bright. O

It O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
decorate O
the O
hall O
separately, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
available O
for O
a O
solemn O
event. O

Everyone O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
friendly O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
Alex, O
for O
our O
celebration! O

If O
I O
had O
to O
choose O
a O
restaurant O
a O
second O
time, O
I O
would O
have O
chosen O
Duplex B-TARGET
without O
hesitation! O

I O
like O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

In O
a O
quiet O
place, B-TARGET
there O
is, O
where O
to O
park O
the O
car, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy!) O

We O
go O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
to O
talk O
and O
eat O
a O
business O
lunch, O
and O
with O
my O
husband O
to O
eat O
good O
meat B-TARGET
and O
drink O
wine!) B-TARGET

Business B-TARGET
lunch I-TARGET
compared O
to O
other O
restaurants O
is O
not O
the O
cheapest, O
but O
the O
quality O
corresponds O
to O
the O
price!!! O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
not O
small O
and O
you O
eat O
very O
well! O

The O
menu B-TARGET
can O
also O
be O
selected O
as O
desired. O

We O
very O
much O
love O
to O
drink O
tea O
and O
is O
very O
pleased O
that O
the O
tea O
is O
always O
brought O
with O
a O
compliment O
from O
the O
restaurant O
- O
2 O
pancakes O
with O
cream O
(when O
not O
on O
a O
diet O
- O
you O
can), O
and O
before O
there O
were O
2 O
options O
of O
fruit O
pure... O

The O
apple B-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
- O
very O
delicious! O

I O
recently O
tried O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
handcuffs I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
- O
delicious O
and O
original O
filling!) B-TARGET

About O
the O
service O
I O
can O
say O
separately, O
I O
like O
that O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
not O
minors, O
but O
very O
nice O
and O
adult O
men!) B-TARGET

My O
favorite O
is O
Peter. O

He O
always O
worries O
that O
we O
eat O
well O
and O
everything O
on O
our O
table O
was O
fine! O

I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
him O
for O
that!) O

But O
the O
other O
waiters B-TARGET
- O
young O
men, O
always O
watch O
for O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
the O
table, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
not O
his... O

So O
we O
are O
all O
satisfied O
and O
we O
go O
here O
quite O
often. O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
wonderful O
and O
varied O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
good O
attitude B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
customers!!! I-TARGET

Walked O
in O
the O
center O
with O
my O
sister, O
washed O
from O
the O
heat O
in O
these O
beautiful O
rare O
warm O
days. O

I O
had O
a O
good O
appetite O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
for O
lunch. O

I O
wanted O
to O
visit O
the O
kitchen O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
far O
away. O

Already O
on O
the O
threshold, O
feeling O
the O
light O
coolness O
of O
the O
air B-TARGET
conditioner I-TARGET
and O
hearing O
pleasant O
music, B-TARGET
they O
realized O
that O
they O
made O
the O
right O
choice! O

Girls B-TARGET
administrators I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
pleasant, O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
elegant O
interior, B-TARGET
comfortable O
tables, B-TARGET
clean O
and O
tasteful. O

The O
menu. O

A O
variety O
of O
dishes, B-TARGET
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
competent, O
will O
name O
the O
ingredients, O
will O
advise O
something O
according O
to O
your O
food O
preferences. O

Dinner O
was O
delicious, O
fast, O
and O
most O
importantly O
very O
delicious! O

Amazing O
desserts, B-TARGET
as O
a O
true O
sweetheart, O
I O
give O
the O
highest O
appreciation. O

In O
fact, O
you O
can O
praise O
a O
lot, O
but O
probably O
everyone O
should O
evaluate O
for O
themselves. O

I O
can O
safely O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
those O
who O
would O
like O
you O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
enjoy O
good O
and O
quality O
cooked O
meals! B-TARGET

You O
can O
always O
find O
disadvantages O
anywhere O
we O
go, O
it O
all O
depends O
on O
our O
mood. O

Although O
in O
some O
places O
in O
our O
city O
they O
find O
themselves, O
these O
shortcomings... O

Objectively, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place. B-TARGET

On O
the O
other O
day, O
on O
a O
business O
trip, O
colleagues O
came O
to O
work O
and O
we, O
all O
four, O
went O
to O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Kamenoostrovsky. O

We O
ate O
a O
lot O
and O
loved O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

I O
personally O
ordered O
salmon O
cakes O
with O
pure O
and O
Canadian O
roll. O

In O
general, O
this O
is O
not O
my O
first O
visit O
to O
this O
institution, O
and O
the O
cakes B-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
here O
I O
have O
already O
tried, O
but O
this O
time, O
they O
were O
cooked O
differently, O
more O
delicious O
and O
juicy O
than O
I O
thought. O

The O
roll B-TARGET
in O
general O
was O
remarkable, O
comparison O
with O
it O
would O
not O
stand O
the O
dishes O
from O
the O
traditional O
St. O
Petersburg O
network O
of O
Japanese O
cuisine)) O

Although, O
I O
do O
not O
know, O
of O
course, O
whether O
this O
comparison O
is O
correct, O
in O
other O
places O
of O
sushi O
somehow O
not O
often O
had. O

After O
asking O
the O
waitress O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
chef O
has O
changed O
and O
the O
menu O
is O
now O
changing. O

The O
disorder O
brought O
information O
that O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
cuttlets I-TARGET
want O
to O
remove O
from O
the O
change O
(. O

My O
friends O
liked O
the O
food B-TARGET
too. O

Especially O
the O
soup B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
two I-TARGET
fish, I-TARGET
a O
steak B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
befstrogans B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
purple. I-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
has O
also O
changed, O
but O
not O
much O
changed O
to O
its O
style, O
service B-TARGET
as O
before O
remained O
at O
a O
fairly O
good O
level, O
in O
general O
we O
remained O
satisfied, O
thank O
you! O

I O
know O
that O
the O
reviews O
are O
often O
viewed O
by O
the O
administrators O
of O
the O
listed O
restaurants, O
a O
very O
big O
request O
to O
You, O
please O
do O
not O
remove O
the O
catches O
from O
the O
menu!!! O

thank O
you! O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
interesting. O

Just O
go O
is O
worth. O

But... O

Service B-TARGET
is O
a O
nightmare. O

The O
last O
Soviet O
dining O
room O
served O
better. O

We O
came O
not O
very O
hungry, O
ordered O
a O
couple O
of O
meals O
and O
tea. O

On O
what O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
told O
us O
that O
the O
order O
should O
be O
for O
1500r. O
and O
if O
not, O
then O
he O
will O
not O
even O
open O
the O
table. O

Then O
he O
said O
that O
they O
generally O
have O
customers O
leaving O
25,000, O
and O
generally... O

Honestly, O
a O
very O
unpleasant O
feeling. O

We, O
of O
course, O
ordered O
cocktails O
again, O
but O
frankly, O
with O
all O
the O
coolness O
of O
the O
entourage, B-TARGET
I O
don’t O
want O
to O
go O
there O
anymore. O

It O
is O
not O
about O
money, O
but O
in O
relation. B-TARGET

Well, O
if O
it's O
so O
hard O
- O
then O
you O
would O
be O
warned O
about O
the O
deposit, O
anyway, O
because O
by O
phone O
to O
book... O

A O
few O
words O
about O
the O
kitchen. O

Food, B-TARGET
quite O
delicious, O
but O
very O
small O
portions O
(as O
in O
general O
we O
have O
in O
restaurants O
in O
Russia O
for O
some O
reason). O

A O
very O
pleasant O
place. B-TARGET

Good O
value O
for O
dishes. B-TARGET

Interior B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
tight O
- O
9 O
points. O

Comfortable O
location, B-TARGET
there O
is O
parking. B-TARGET

I O
can’t O
say O
that O
I O
liked O
all O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
but O
some O
are O
very O
good. O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
of O
this O
place O
is O
the O
crowd O
of O
people O
on O
weekends O
and O
how O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
chefs B-TARGET
deal O
with O
this O
flow. O

I O
hope O
that O
they O
will O
solve O
this O
problem O
- O
long O
service, B-TARGET
but O
overall, O
we O
really O
like O
this O
place B-TARGET
and O
we O
all O
recommend O
it, O
especially O
on O
weekdays!!!!) O

We O
had O
friends O
from O
Vilnius. O

A O
few O
days O
of O
cultural O
program O
in O
our O
beautiful O
St. O
Petersburg. O

One O
day O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch O
at O
the O
Adjabsandal O
restaurant. O

We O
are O
4 O
adults O
and O
3 O
children O
(4.6 O
and O
9 O
years O
old). O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
really O
liked O
it O
all!! O

When O
we O
entered O
the O
restaurant O
there O
was O
no O
one O
in O
the O
room, O
then O
two O
other O
visitors O
came. O

Nice O
interior B-TARGET
(all O
like O
in O
the O
photo), O
probably O
even O
more O
comfortable O
in O
reality. O

Sitting O
at O
a O
large O
table. O

They O
ordered: O
Harcho, O
Lagman, O
Hinkali, O
Chihirtma, O
Duschbar, O
Dolma, O
Hachapuri O
in O
the O
Mendel O
language O
(1 O
piece) O
all O
got O
a O
piece. O

All O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
prepared O
at O
home. O

Great O
respect O
for O
the O
cook. O

The O
chinchali B-TARGET
dish O
consists O
of O
4 O
pieces, O
good O
sizes, O
after O
a O
salad O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
hatchapuri O
I O
barely O
ate. O

The O
husband O
also O
ordered O
hinkali B-TARGET
(after O
Chihirta) O
and O
said O
that O
one O
serving O
could O
be O
taken O
for O
two. O

A O
friend O
ordered O
beer, O
harcho O
and O
lagman, B-TARGET
as O
a O
result, O
a O
part O
of O
lagman O
he O
did O
not O
eat, O
although O
to O
eat O
he O
really O
loves:). O

So O
the O
portions B-TARGET
of O
all O
dishes O
are O
normal O
and O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
really O
everything O
cooked O
at O
home. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
also O
at O
a O
high O
level, O
not O
everything O
obsessive, O
but O
with O
a O
lot. O

I O
recommend O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
want O
to O
wish O
the O
management B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
good O
luck O
in O
the O
business O
and O
most O
importantly O
keep O
this O
bar O
of O
quality O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
great O
service. B-TARGET

I O
rarely O
write O
negative O
reviews, O
but O
in O
this O
case O
I O
just O
consider O
it O
a O
matter O
of O
principle. O

I O
went O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
Sunday O
evening. O

Let’s O
say, O
I O
haven’t O
had O
such O
a O
disgusting O
impression O
of O
visiting O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
/ I-TARGET
pub I-TARGET
in O
a O
long O
time. O

We O
were O
met O
and O
served O
by O
a O
friendly O
waitress. B-TARGET

Half O
of O
the O
menus B-TARGET
were O
not O
available. O

When O
asked O
why, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
answered O
with O
the O
challenge O
that O
it O
was O
all O
yesterday, O
and O
today O
it O
was O
over. O

I O
ordered O
cheesecakes. O

We O
waited O
for O
them, O
we O
waited, O
the O
officer B-TARGET
came O
and O
that O
she O
had O
dropped O
them O
on O
the O
floor, O
and O
that O
these O
were O
the O
last O
sticks O
and O
there O
will O
be O
no O
sticks O
at O
all. O

I O
wanted O
to O
get O
up O
and O
go, O
but O
since O
this O
is O
the O
only O
place O
to O
drink O
beer O
in O
the O
vicinity, O
I O
had O
to O
stay. O

My O
friend O
ordered O
a O
caesarean B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
(no O
chicken B-TARGET
was O
found), O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
completely O
disgusting O
in O
appearance O
and O
taste. O

Then O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
not O
too O
polite O
to O
ask O
if O
we O
knew O
they O
were O
working O
on O
Sunday O
until O
11am. O

We O
answered, O
“We O
already O
know.” O

Such O
things O
in O
general. O

I O
do O
not O
advise O
going O
there, O
in O
more O
crowded O
days O
they O
are O
more O
adequate O
staff O
and O
dishes O
are O
all O
available, O
but O
something O
tells O
me O
that O
they O
were O
cooked. O

I O
recently O
celebrated O
my O
40th O
birthday, O
it O
was O
just O
unforgettable. O

Very O
delicious O
pizza B-TARGET
and O
snack B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
a O
large O
selection O
of O
hot B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
for O
every O
taste, O
all O
guests O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
cooking O
and O
very O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
a O
large O
tiramisu B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
for O
dessert, O
made O
by O
ourselves O
- O
it O
was O
very O
delicious, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
room O
in O
the O
stomach, O
so O
it O
was O
given O
to O
the O
guests O
in O
the O
house. O

Quiet O
and O
pleasant O
music. B-TARGET

Very O
attentive O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
administrators. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
celebration O
and O
a O
very O
emotional O
atmosphere O
:) O

I O
did O
not O
like O
the O
service! B-TARGET

They O
were O
yesterday O
evening, O
ordered, O
brought O
quite O
quickly, O
but O
then O
they O
seemed O
to O
have O
forgotten O
about O
us, O
we O
drank O
drinks O
and O
wanted O
to O
repeat O
them, O
but O
no O
one O
approached O
us O
for O
half O
an O
hour, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
ran O
past, O
but O
they O
didn't O
even O
look O
at O
us, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
tried O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
ourselves. O

There O
were O
very O
few O
tables O
in O
the O
room. O

In O
the O
end, O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bar O
and O
call O
someone. O

Then O
we O
waited O
for O
drinks O
for O
about O
40 O
minutes, O
and O
when O
asked O
where O
our O
drinks O
were, O
we O
were O
given: O
"What, O
you O
haven't O
brought O
them O
yet???". O

It O
is O
also O
surprising O
that O
the O
guests O
in O
the O
"Plyushkin" O
are O
not O
saying O
goodbye. O

A O
sharp O
contrast O
of O
poor O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
delicious O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
cozy O
interior....!!!! B-TARGET

This O
institution O
is O
a O
fairly O
common O
opinion, O
I O
decided O
to O
check O
it O
myself, O
because O
I O
live O
nearby. O

I O
went O
for O
lunch O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
met O
quite O
welcomed, O
asked O
in O
the O
first O
I O
was O
in O
the O
institution O
or O
already O
was, O
it O
suggests O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
cares O
about O
their O
guests O
and O
remembers O
all O
the O
regular) O

I O
was O
helped O
with O
choosing O
a O
table O
and O
told O
about O
all O
the O
promotions O
and O
offers. O

50% O
discount O
on O
the O
Japanese B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
attentive, O
the O
food B-TARGET
liked, O
the B-TARGET
range I-TARGET
of O
the O
bar O
is O
large O
but O
I O
only O
drank O
tea, O
as O
I O
came O
to O
lunch O
and O
I O
can O
say O
nothing O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
drinks. O

When O
calculating O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
colorfully O
told O
about O
the O
program O
on O
the O
weekends, O
about O
parties O
and O
artists, O
just O
couldn't O
refuse O
him O
and O
promised O
to O
come! O

Overall, O
my O
impression O
is O
quite O
positive O
about O
this O
institution B-TARGET
and O
I O
plan O
to O
visit O
it O
often O
now. O

I O
wanted O
to O
write O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
time O
for O
it, O
only O
now O
I O
write... O

For O
several O
years O
we O
have O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
'Hutor O
Watergray'. O

I O
always O
liked O
everything, O
and O
the O
kitchen, O
and O
the O
service, O
the O
atmosphere O
and O
the O
mood O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

I O
have O
always O
felt O
the O
Ukrainian O
colour! O

However, O
our O
last O
visit O
overturned O
all O
the O
positive O
impressions. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
came O
in O
the O
evening, O
no O
one O
met O
us, O
we O
stood O
at O
the O
entrance O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
sat O
by O
ourselves, O
confused, O
and O
after O
10 O
minutes O
(!), O
someone O
approached O
us O
in O
swollen O
down O
jeans, O
gave O
us O
a O
menu O
and O
said, O
"Wait O
for O
the O
waitress," O
as O
he O
himself O
could O
not O
help O
us O
with O
the O
selection O
of O
drinks. O

I O
would O
very O
much O
like O
to O
ask O
the O
managers, O
do O
they O
consider O
this O
acceptable, O
provided O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
of O
a O
high O
level?!! O

The O
horror O
of O
that O
evening O
continued. O

Then O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
approached O
us, O
who O
seemed O
to O
me O
not O
even O
opening O
the O
menu, O
unlike O
me, O
who O
studied O
it O
in O
20 O
minutes O
of O
waiting! O

I O
ordered O
and O
ate O
half. O

We O
decided O
to O
take O
our O
favorite O
cakes O
with O
us, O
knowing O
that O
they O
are O
handmade, O
and O
at O
least O
somehow O
to O
raise O
the O
mood. O

Again O
a O
surprise! O

They O
are O
no O
longer O
on O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

When O
asked, O
“Why?” O
the O
waitress O
said O
that O
no O
one O
could O
do O
them. O

Unfortunately, O
we O
have O
never O
understood O
what O
is O
going O
on O
with O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
it O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
proper O
level O
is O
no O
longer O
and O
will O
have O
to O
look O
for O
a O
new O
favorite O
restaurant. O

by O
Julia. O

I O
went O
to O
a O
cafe O
with O
a O
friend O
for O
lunch. O

They O
are O
satisfied O
with O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
environment B-TARGET
and O
the O
prices. O

I O
ordered O
a O
pizza O
- O
very O
delicious, O
really O
good O
pizza. B-TARGET

Mint O
tea O
in O
the O
tea O
bar, O
ice O
cream O
and O
dessert, O
a O
glass O
of O
red O
wine. O

I O
paid O
about O
1000 O
rubles. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
is O
polite, O
quick, O
answers O
questions, O
no O
complaints. O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
small, O
if O
several O
plates, O
then O
they O
are O
placed O
with O
difficulty, O
and O
overall O
inside O
is O
tight, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
located O
close, O
so O
you O
can O
hear O
what O
they O
are O
talking O
about O
behind O
the O
neighbouring O
table. O

Going O
for O
lunch O
is O
a O
good O
choice, O
something O
to O
discuss O
and O
sit O
quietly O
is O
not O
the O
most O
suitable O
place. B-TARGET

I O
will O
not O
go O
to O
pizza B-TARGET
again. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
specific, O
already O
very O
Italian, O
the O
girlfriend O
did O
not O
like O
it, O
so O
maybe O
not O
everyone O
will O
seem O
nice. O

But O
it’s O
not O
as O
important O
as O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
normal O
service B-TARGET
:) O

Not O
so O
long O
ago O
I O
was O
in O
Jean-Jacques O
with O
a O
friend, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
share O
my O
impressions. O

Usually O
they O
went O
to O
Nevsky O
166, O
and O
this O
time O
they O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Marathon O
for O
a O
comparison. O

It O
was O
Friday O
night O
and O
the O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance. O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
not O
met, O
but O
walking O
a O
little O
further, O
closer O
to O
the O
bar O
stand, O
we O
saw O
the O
administrator, O
who O
apparently O
took O
our O
reservation, O
led O
us O
to O
the O
table O
and O
offered O
drinks. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
young O
man. O

The O
order O
accepted O
almost O
immediately, O
even O
managed O
to O
enter O
into O
a O
dialogue O
with O
him, O
advised O
the O
fish O
and O
the O
vineyard. O

Regarding O
the O
service, O
what O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
we O
did O
not O
feel O
the O
invulnerability O
of O
the B-TARGET
waitress, I-TARGET
but O
the O
attention O
was O
not O
exhausted. O

By O
gestures O
or O
views, O
he O
understood O
that O
we O
needed O
his O
help O
and O
reacted O
immediately. O

The O
kitchen. O

The O
kitchen! O

I’ve O
always O
liked O
how O
they O
cook O
here. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
juicy, O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill O
and O
the O
bread B-TARGET
basket I-TARGET
- O
just O
admiration!! O

We O
always O
order O
one O
basket, B-TARGET
and O
then O
several O
more O
times! O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
refuse O
it! O

As O
for O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
fine, O
but O
only O
one O
minus O
for O
me. O

Too O
close, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
located O
close O
to O
each O
other, O
you O
will O
not O
want O
to O
hear O
neighbor O
conversations O
and O
not O
only. O

In O
summary, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
we O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
visit! O

Wait O
for O
us O
again! O

On O
August O
12, O
2014, O
we O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
at O
our O
favourite O
restaurant. O

The O
choice O
was O
made O
by O
several O
qualities O
of O
this O
place: B-TARGET
a O
great O
menu B-TARGET
(large O
selection), O
delicious O
baking!!!, B-TARGET
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
good O
location B-TARGET
(metro O
nearby), O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
presence O
of O
natural O
lighting O
makes O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
even O
more O
comfortable, O
the O
price O
matches O
the O
quality!!! O

We O
would O
like O
to O
say O
a O
big O
thank O
you O
to O
all O
the O
staff!! B-TARGET

Separately, O
we O
thank O
the O
wonderful O
banquet O
manager B-TARGET
Anna, O
who O
professionally O
helped: O
everything O
detailed O

27.04.2013 O
Visited O
your O
restaurant O
Eurasia,with O
the O
family O
in O
g. O

The O
Lomonosov! O

It O
all O
liked! O

Service B-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level, O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
menus B-TARGET
and O
drinks) B-TARGET
pleasant O
interior, B-TARGET
quiet, O
quiet! O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Marina, O
was O
polite, O
friendly O
very O
quickly O
accepted O
the O
order) O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
quickly O
cooked, O
incredibly O
everything O
was O
delicious. O

The B-TARGET
men I-TARGET
worked O
in O
the O
team, O
the O
manager B-TARGET
helped O
the O
waiters O
all O
the O
time. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much) O

Good O
luck O
and O
prosperity O
to O
you!! O

All O
good O
day! O

There O
were O
9 O
people O
at O
this O
restaurant O
yesterday. O

I O
could O
say, O
I O
sat O
cleanly O
in O
Russian O
in O
an O
Italian O
restaurant O
:) O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
comfortable, O
there O
are O
sofas. B-TARGET

There O
was O
good O
music, B-TARGET
which O
was O
pleasant O
too. O

I O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
orders, O
my O
choice O
fell O
on O
a O
paste O
with O
a O
smoked O
chest. O

I O
very O
liked. O

The O
vegetable B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
also O
tasted O
good. O

Meat B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
plates I-TARGET
are O
quite O
common, O
but O
there O
is O
nothing O
negative O
to O
say O
about O
them. O

The O
guys O
ordered O
mostly O
steaks B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
and O
by O
their O
happy O
faces O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
understand O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
definitely O
delicious O
and O
pleasant. O

I O
just O
missed O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
chef, I-TARGET
but O
that’s O
the O
way. O

They O
drank O
morse, O
wine, O
vodka, O
beer. O

There O
are O
no O
surprises, O
except O
that O
the O
range B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
can O
be O
made O
and O
more, O
not O
like O
in O
pubs, O
but O
3-4 O
options. O

The O
imposition O
of O
Heineken O
is O
not O
welcome. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
pleasant, O
it O
has O
to O
rest. O

According O
to O
the O
contingent, O
you O
can O
understand O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
for O
those O
over O
30, O
for O
family O
couples, O
just O
for O
lovers. O

But O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
will O
not O
disappear. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
at O
the O
height, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
because O
of O
the O
ambitions O
we O
indicated O
on O
the O
volume O
of O
the O
order O
and O
as O
a O
consequence O
the O
future O
tea. O

But O
the O
girl B-TARGET
was O
very O
kind, O
attentive O
and O
just O
beautiful O
:) O

My O
name O
is O
Natasha O
:) O

It’s O
a O
pity O
that O
I O
didn’t O
break O
the O
phone. O

All O
in O
all, O
I O
recommend. O

I O
read O
the O
reviews O
on O
this O
site O
and O
decided O
to O
visit O
the O
institution. O

Everything O
was O
“at O
the O
level.” O

I O
liked O
the O
beautiful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
polite, O
fairly O
fast O
service. B-TARGET

But O
most O
importantly, O
everything O
was O
delicious. O

I O
have O
not O
been O
in O
a O
facility O
for O
a O
long O
time O
that O
I O
had O
almost O
no O
complaints O
about. O

We O
sat O
down O
with O
friends O
just O
wonderfully O
and O
all O
left O
in O
a O
good O
mood. O

I O
will O
definitely O
go O
there O
again. O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
or O
coffee O
shop. B-TARGET

Very O
cozy O
environment, B-TARGET
good O
staff, B-TARGET
pleasant O
interior. B-TARGET

Something O
resembles O
the O
cafeteria O
from O
the O
series O
"Friends", O
not O
by O
design, O
but O
rather O
by O
comfort, O
where O
you O
want O
to O
come O
in O
company O
or O
alone O
to O
sit O
in O
peace O
and O
read O
a O
book. O

Among O
the O
disadvantages O
is O
a O
noisy O
elevator B-TARGET
that O
drives O
food O
from O
the O
kitchen, O
which O
is O
on O
the O
first O
floor, O
although O
the O
idea O
is O
interesting. O

Well, O
for O
someone O
a O
minus, O
and O
for O
me O
a O
plus, O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
institution O
against O
alcohol B-TARGET
and O
in O
his O
establishments O
it O
is O
not O
sold O
in O
principle. O

But O
if O
you O
order O
a O
banquet, O
you O
can O
come O
with O
your O
own, O
but O
provided O
that O
there O
are O
checks. O

It O
seems O
that O
it O
has O
recently O
opened, O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
only O
get O
better O
over O
time. O

Anniversary O
is O
the O
occasion O
when O
you O
want O
to O
gather O
only O
your O
not O
large O
company O
in O
a O
cozy O
institution. O

I O
searched O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
because O
by O
nature O
a O
pretty O
delightful O
person O
and O
found O
this O
wonderful O
cafe. B-TARGET

There O
is O
everything O
here: O
interior, B-TARGET
delicious O
unusual O
dishes, B-TARGET
water O
on O
the O
table, O
which O
is O
especially O
pleasant O
and O
attentive, O
hospitable O
staff, B-TARGET
which O
is O
rare O
for O
our O
city. O

To O
say O
that O
everyone O
is O
happy O
with O
my O
choice O
is O
nothing O
to O
say. O

Now O
this O
is O
our O
favorite O
place. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
little B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
party. I-TARGET

I O
have O
never O
written O
reviews O
before, O
but O
the O
emotions O
are O
overwhelming. O

We O
had O
to O
specially O
register. O
on O
April O
13, O
we O
had O
a O
banquet O
in O
"Old O
Plovdiv". O

I O
can't O
help O
but O
write O
a O
review, O
as O
I O
am O
still O
impressed O
by O
visiting O
this O
place. B-TARGET

There O
were O
people O
of O
different O
ages O
at O
the O
banquet O
and O
there O
was O
no O
one O
who O
would O
not O
like O
anything. O

Wonderful O
everything: O
and O
the O
room B-TARGET
(sitting O
in O
the O
central B-TARGET
hall I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
second O
floor) O
and O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
and O
the O
appearance B-TARGET
of O
the O
table. O

But O
the O
most O
delighted O
employees B-TARGET
- O
the O
administrator, B-TARGET
who O
helped O
to O
compile O
the O
order, O
as O
well O
as O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Maria, O
whose O
work B-TARGET
is O
above O
all O
praise. O

Friendly, O
smiling, O
brought O
everything O
and O
took O
it O
on O
time, O
asked O
if O
everything O
liked, O
advised O
before O
orders. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
many O
restaurants O
before, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
at O
the O
top O
level. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
collective! B-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
visit O
you O
again O
and O
will O
recommend O
your O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
our O
friends. O

Hi O
to! O

I O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
regularly O
with O
my O
friends. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
weekend O
in O
some O
company O
fun, O
fun, O
delicious, O
then O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
for O
this! O

Wonderful O
Margarita, B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
great O
music!!! B-TARGET

I O
live O
in O
a O
different O
area, O
but O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
come O
here, O
forgive O
me O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Mexican O
restaurants, O
the O
Mexican B-TARGET
food, I-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
evening! O

It O
is O
also O
pleasant O
that O
the O
kitchen O
on O
the O
weekend O
works O
long O
unlike O
many O
other O
establishments! O

The O
place B-TARGET
has O
never O
failed, O
I O
recommend! O

In O
one O
of O
the O
recent, O
not O
at O
all O
spring O
cold O
nights O
wanted O
warmth O
and O
comfort. O

Invite O
a O
girl O
to O
AMARENA O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner! O

I’ve O
never O
been O
to O
a O
restaurant O
before, O
but O
I’ve O
often O
passed O
by. O

I O
have O
long O
wanted O
to O
visit. O

The O
evening O
started O
to O
be O
pleased O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
arrived O
quickly, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
quite O
conveniently O
located. O

We O
were O
welcomed O
and O
brought O
to O
the O
table, O
delivered O
the O
menu. O

All O
right, O
with O
a O
sincere O
smile O
(seems O
to O
be O
the O
administrator). B-TARGET

Soon O
an O
even O
less O
friendly O
waitress B-TARGET
appeared O
and O
asked O
if O
we O
were O
ready O
to O
make O
an O
order. O

While O
waiting O
for O
food, O
we O
looked. O

Apartment O
with O
very O
pleasant O
interior, B-TARGET
in O
warm O
tones. O

The O
light O
furniture. O

It O
was O
very O
comfortable O
and O
comfortable! O

For O
themselves O
noted O
that O
the O
hall B-TARGET
is O
perfect O
for O
celebrating O
some O
large-scale O
events. O

I O
liked O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
too! O
(thank O
you O
for O
this!) O

Salmon B-TARGET
just O
melted O
in O
the O
mouth, O
Caesar’s B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
is O
out O
of O
all O
praise! O

My O
companion O
did O
not O
refuse O
a O
dessert. O

I O
didn’t O
remember O
the O
name, O
but O
it O
looked O
like O
“something” O
colorful, O
very O
beautiful. O

Overall, O
we O
had O
a O
great O
evening! O
the O
girl O
liked O
it O
all O
too!!! O

R O
is O

S. O
We O
will O
come O
again. O

Recently O
opened O
for O
myself O
this O
café B-TARGET
"On I-TARGET
Pairs", I-TARGET
nowhere O
else O
did O
I O
meet O
the O
kitchen, O
where O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
cooked O
for O
a O
couple. O

I O
monitor O
my O
health O
and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
that O
dishes B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
a O
couple O
can O
not O
only O
be O
useful, O
but O
also O
very O
delicious. O

At O
each O
new O
visit O
I O
try O
to O
try O
new O
dishes O
from O
the O
menu, O
especially O
I O
liked: O
Caesar B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken, I-TARGET
salmon B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
shrimp B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
and O
tyramisu B-TARGET
from O
the O
chef. O

The O
last O
time O
I O
was O
with O
a O
friend, O
he O
ordered O
a O
calcium. O

Overall, O
the O
guys O
of O
Kalyan B-TARGET
did O
well, O
but O
did O
it O
very O
long. O

Probably O
because O
of O
the O
large O
number O
of O
visitors. O

The B-TARGET
setting I-TARGET
of O
the O
cafe O
is O
quite O
convenient O
to O
rest-soft B-TARGET
furniture, I-TARGET
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
separated O
by O
curtains, O
but O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
cool O
when O
the O
entrance O
door O
opens O
and O
closes O
if O
you O
sit O
near O
the O
entrance. O

Despite O
all O
this, O
it O
is O
now O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
establishments, B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
my O
acquaintances. O

Celebrated O
50 O
years. O

Two O
days O
in O
a O
row. O

Very O
liked O
it. O

The O
situation B-TARGET
has O
a O
spiritual O
feast O
with O
toasts, O
speeches O
and O
conversations O
(the O
room B-TARGET
is O
small, O
cozy O
and O
not O
noisy). O

It O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
reserve O
the O
entire O
room O
due O
to O
the O
small O
number O
of O
visitors. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
surprises O
and O
pleases O
the O
eye, O
gives O
the O
opportunity O
to O
enjoy O
the O
painting B-TARGET
of O
St. O
Petersburg O
artists. O

Kitchen: O
the O
banquet B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
1800 O
rubles O
was O
well O
arranged O
with O
its O
variety, O
taste O
and O
quantity. O

Plus O
pleased O
the O
opportunity O
to O
bring O
their O
own O
alcohol O
and O
sweets, O
although, O
as O
it O
turned O
out O
later, O
the O
chef O
bakes O
very O
delicious O
cakes, B-TARGET
which O
we O
unfortunately O
did O
not O
know O
in O
advance. O

Warned O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
hot B-TARGET
(red O
fish O
or O
beef), O
but O
the O
large O
portions B-TARGET
and O
refined O
taste O
pleasantly O
impressed. O

A O
company O
of O
14-20 O
people O
was O
served O
by O
two O
waiters. O

Service B-TARGET
at O
a O
high O
level O
(silent, O
imperceptible, O
delicate). O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
excess O
food, O
alcohol O
and O
juice O
were O
packed O
and O
given. O

There O
is O
room B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
dancing I-TARGET
if O
desired. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
kindly O
allowed O
to O
put O
any O
music. O

We O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
have O
not O
lost O
it. O

N O
Begin O
from O
a O
distance)) O
year O
1,5-2 O
ago O
I O
went O
to O
the O
"distance" O
and O
remained O
with O
ambiguous O
impressions O
(whether O
you O
liked O
it O
or O
not). O

The O
kitchen O
is O
nothing, O
some O
strange O
staff O
in O
an O
incomprehensible O
form, O
service O
is O
nothing. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
got O
stuck O
was O
the O
design B-TARGET
of O
the O
cafe, O
very O
beautiful. O

Literally O
the O
day O
I O
decided O
to O
take O
a O
risk O
and O
go O
to O
rest. O

Coffee O
could O
only O
be O
recognized O
by O
the O
design O
left, O
everything O
else O
changed. O

I O
ordered O
a O
salad, B-TARGET
so O
I O
even O
regretted O
eating O
it, O
it O
was O
so O
beautifully O
decorated)) O
I O
no O
longer O
say O
that O
it O
was O
very O
delicious). O

I O
liked O
the O
unobtrusive O
and O
quality O
service. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
comfortable O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
I O
didn't O
even O
want O
to O
leave O
you, O
everything O
was O
so O
warm O
and O
pleasant!) O

A O
pleasant O
institution. B-TARGET

There O
is O
really O
a O
lot O
of O
space, O
both O
in O
the O
halls B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
halls B-TARGET
and O
the O
closet. B-TARGET

It O
was O
three O
o’clock O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
there O
was O
hardly O
anyone. O

All O
around O
is O
quiet O
and O
calm. O

The O
administrator B-TARGET
led O
to O
the O
table, O
immediately O
approached O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
offered O
the O
menu. O

I O
ordered O
mushroom O
soup O
and O
vegetables O
with O
fish, O
and O
finally O
coffee. O

Everything O
liked O
the O
taste, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
good O
- O
eaten, O
well, O
and O
you O
can O
note O
the O
design B-TARGET
of O
the O
dishes. O

Prices O
are O
average. O

It O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
get O
to O
the O
performance O
sometime O
in O
the O
evening O
- O
not O
in O
vain O
there O
is O
a O
pretty O
big O
scene O
here! O

Last O
Sunday, O
March O
24, O
the O
birthday O
of O
my O
son O
was O
celebrated O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
chose O
a O
place, O
because O
the O
children's O
holiday O
is O
not O
easy O
for O
you: O
parents O
want O
to O
talk, O
eat O
deliciously, O
drink O
finally O
- O
we O
have O
our O
holiday, O
and O
the O
children, O
of O
course, O
want O
to O
bustle, O
play, O
in O
addition, O
everything O
is O
still O
of O
different O
ages, O
who O
is O
interested. O

But O
don't O
get O
wrong, O
a O
wonderful O
children's B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
a O
wonderful O
babysitter, B-TARGET
all O
the O
children O
at O
work, O
something O
is O
glued, O
something O
is O
mastered, O
they O
are O
not O
visible O
or O
heard! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
whole O
party O
was O
organized. O

We O
came O
several O
times, O
watched, O
the O
table O
was O
chosen, O
so O
they O
immediately O
said O
how O
and O
what O
is O
better O
to O
do, O
where O
to O
sit, O
at O
what O
time O
is O
better O
to O
start O
the O
holiday, O
what O
snacks O
to O
put O
on O
the O
table. O

And O
when O
we O
came O
on O
a O
holiday O
day, O
even O
balls O
decorated O
our O
table! O

It O
is O
free!) O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
large, O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
no O
one O
interferes. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
kids O
liked O
the O
pizza, B-TARGET
friends O
praised O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood, I-TARGET
my O
husband O
liked O
pork B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushrooms, I-TARGET
and O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
lasagna B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
delicious O
and O
filling. O

It O
wasn’t O
cheap, O
but O
it O
was O
worth O
it. O

The O
head O
did O
not O
hurt O
about O
anything, O
the O
children O
were O
happy, O
the O
friends O
liked O
it O
too. O

The O

succeeded! O

I O
am O
glad O
there O
is O
such O
a O
place B-TARGET
in O
our O
area O
now. O

remained O
very O
satisfied. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
the O
chef O
for O
the O
delicious O
salad B-TARGET
and O
hot B-TARGET
food. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are I-TARGET
large, O
but O
most O
importantly, O
they O
are O
delicious. O

I O
tried O
local B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
and O
I O
liked O
it. O

Easy O
and O
soft. O

It O
is O
very O
pleasant O
that O
the O
prices O
are O
not O
high, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
5 O
points. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
cute O
girls. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
fun O
and O
there O
are O
many O
guests. O

They O
have O
parked. O

All O

are O
occupied. O

Did O
not O
expect O
that. O

We O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
on O
March O
8 O
in O
three O
coupons. O

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
large, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
pleased, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
attentive. O

Very O
liked O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Shahid, O
answered O
all O
questions O
about O
the O
dishes, O
the O
order O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
long. O

The O
food B-TARGET
liked, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
large, O
beautifully O
decorated, O
everything O
was O
delicious. O

All O
the O
tables O
were O
busy, O
but O
nobody O
hindered O
speaking O
quietly, O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
not O
playing O
loudly. O

Very O
delicious O
desserts: B-TARGET
tiramisu, B-TARGET
blueberry B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
and O
black B-TARGET
forest. I-TARGET

At O
the O
price O
of O
coupons O
it O
was O
quite O
acceptable. O

With O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine, O
salads, O
hot O
and O
desserts O
was O
less O
than O
1000 O
rubles O
per O
person. O

My O
review O
Service: O
We O
ordered O
a O
table O
and O
ate O
in O
advance, O
in O
about O
three O
hours. O

We O
arrived O
on O
time, O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table O
and... O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
waiting O
for O
half O
an O
hour, O
she O
ran, O
put O
a O
bottle O
of O
vodka O
and O
remained O
silent. O

I O
don't O
drink O
alcohol O
and O
I O
had O
to O
order O
tea O
and O
my O
daughter O
limonade O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bar O
stand O
and O
look O
for O
someone O
to O
accept O
the O
order. O

We O
started O
to O
bring O
the O
crumbs, O
given O
what O
we O
ordered O
in O
advance. O

After O
the O
dessert O
I O
waited O
another O
15 O
minutes. O

Wardrobe: B-TARGET
I O
went O
out O
of O
the O
oak O
room O
three O
times, O
and O
two O
of O
them O
watched O
the O
people O
waiting O
for O
them O
to O
find O
their O
clothes. O

One O
lady O
even O
went O
there O
to O
find O
her O
food O
jacket: O
I O
went O
to O
another O
restaurant O
before, O
their O
menus O
are O
similar O
in O
principle, O
the O
interior O
too. O

In O
the O
"China O
House" O
I O
ate O
hard, O
it O
wasn't O
delicious. O

I O
am O
a O
fan O
of O
Chinese O
food. O

I O
the O
dessert, O
it O
was O
at O
the O
level, O
but O
if O
I O
ate O
the O
same O
in O
another O
restaurant O
for O
120 O
rubles, O
then O
here O
it O
is O
400, O
the O
difference O
is O
noticeable. O

In O
general, O
some O
nerves O
and O
negativity O
from O
this O
place, B-TARGET
we O
did O
not O
eat, O
but O
waited O
and O
remembered O
what O
was O
ordered O
there. O

Service B-TARGET
on O
the O
minus, O
from O
the B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
no O
smiles, O
no O
service. B-TARGET

I O
am O
no O
longer O
walking O
there. O

I’ve O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
four O
times O
since O
December O
last O
year. O

Excellent O
wine, B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
with O
beautiful O
serving, B-TARGET
calm O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
great O
service. B-TARGET

As O
for O
the O
ratings O
(from O
1 O
to O
10): O
- O
7 O
bet O
for O
the O
kitchen O
because O
I O
would O
like O
more O
variety O
in O
the O
menu O
on O
the O
main B-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET
- O
5 O
for O
the O
interior B-TARGET
- O
not O
very O
comfortable O
on O
these O
chairs, B-TARGET
the O
bag O
nowhere O
to O
put, O
optimal O
seats B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the O
window O
(relatively O
comfortable) O
- O
10 O
for O
the O
service B-TARGET
- O
always O
attentive O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
discreet O
staff, B-TARGET
which O
should O
correspond O
to O
the O
restaurant O
service. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
Saturday O
night. O

I O
want O
to O
express O
my O
great O
thanks O
first O
of O
all O
to O
the O
management B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
the O
serving B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
and, O
of O
course, O
those O
chefs B-TARGET
who O
prepare O
such O
delicious B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
to O
the O
visitors O
of O
the O
institution. O

I O
liked O
absolutely O
everything. O

Of O
course, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
impressive: O
cozy O
and O
beautiful. O

The O
table B-TARGET
was O
great. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
for O
a O
restaurant O
of O
this O
level O
the O
prices O
are O
not O
high. O

I O
want O
to O
dive O
again O
into O
the O
unforgettable O
atmosphere B-TARGET
that O
is O
inherent O
in O
this O
establishment. O

Last O
week, O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
celebrated O
our O
2nd O
anniversary. O

We O
chose O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
Makarenu B-TARGET
and O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
choice! O

The O
menu O
is B-TARGET
great, O
so O
much O
that O
I O
decided O
to O
come O
in O
more O
often O
to O
try O
different O
dishes. B-TARGET

Cocktails B-TARGET
are O
very O
delicious O
and O
unusual, O
there O
is O
something O
to O
choose O
from. O

They O
ordered O
salads O
from O
the O
tongue O
and O
seafood O
and O
paella O
with O
chicken O
and O
rabbit. O

Everything O
is O
delicious O
and O
delicious, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
large, O
hugged! O

Excellent O
calyan, B-TARGET
fully, O
beautiful O
young O
man O
calyancher, B-TARGET
friendly, O
helped O
to O
decide O
with O
the O
choice O
and O
did O
not O
miss! O

Beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
were O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
by O
the O
window. O

The O
music B-TARGET
liked, O
does O
not O
pressure O
the O
volume O
as O
in O
many O
institutions, O
but O
creates O
a O
cozy O
romantic O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
everyone O
smiles, O
constantly O
approaches O
cleaned O
from O
the O
table, O
offered O
to O
make O
a B-TARGET
storage I-TARGET
discount, I-TARGET
which O
is O
very O
even O
good! O

Thank O
you O
for O
a O
beautiful O
evening! O

We O
are O
your O
regular O
customers! O

came O
to O
friends O
in O
Peter O
from O
Moscow O
for O
the O
New O
Year O
2013, O
who O
led O
us O
to O
this O
institution. B-TARGET

Everything O
very O
much O
liked: O
kitchen, B-TARGET
interior, B-TARGET
food, B-TARGET
and O
a O
check B-TARGET
for O
six O
people O
with O

:) O

Very O
cozy O
place, B-TARGET
only O
here O
the O
area O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
small, O
there O
is O
a O
small O
minus, O
it O
may O
be, O
there O
will O
be O
no O
free O
seats! O

The O
day O
of O
March O
8th O
has O
passed, O
and O
the O
results O
can O
be O
summed O
up. O

I O
decided O
to O
write O
a O
review O
about O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
celebrated O
a O
beautiful O
fun O
holiday, O
read O
the O
reviews O
of O
edik077 O
and O
Rules77777and O
realized O
that O
either O
we O
were O
in O
different O
restaurants, O
or O
the O
guys O
had O
something O
wrong. O

Now O
about O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance O
and O
did O
as O
suggested O
by O
the O
administrator, B-TARGET
i.e. O
made O
a O
pre-order, O
when O
they O
came O
to O
see O
a O
fully O
filled O
restaurant O
they O
realized O
that O
the O
advice O
was O
really O
right, O
there O
was O
a O
70-80 O
person O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
there O
is O
a O
really O
hot O
dish O
you O
can O
wait O
very O
long. O

The O
menu O
is O
quite O
varied O
and O
very O
delicious, O
I O
and O
my O
friends O
liked O
everything O
they O
brought O
us, O
and O
brought O
us O
a O
lot. O

The O
service O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city, O
but O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
did O
everything O
they O
needed. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
all O
the O
way, O
not O
very O
long, O
of O
course, O
but O
still. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
good, O
comfortable O
sofas. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
music B-TARGET
program I-TARGET
and O
a O
fun O
host. B-TARGET

Overall, O
I O
was O
pleased O
with O
my O
choice, O
and O
as O
we O
spent O
the O
evening, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
good, O
cozy O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
good. O

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
management B-TARGET
and O
staff. B-TARGET

We O
visited O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant B-TARGET
late O
in O
the O
evening, O
closer O
to O
midnight, O
when O
there O
was O
no O
real O
food O
anywhere. O

Despite O
the O
bad O
weather, O
we O
tried O
to O
show O
our O
visiting O
relatives O
all O
the O
beauty O
of O
our O
city, O
including O
white O
nights. O

"Apartment B-TARGET
No. I-TARGET
55" I-TARGET
was O
chosen O
due O
to O
the O
location B-TARGET
and O
schedule O
of O
work, O
well O
and O
reviews O
are O
good. O

They O
often O
passed O
by, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
reason O
to O
come O
in. O

We O
were O
fed O
and O
drunk O
in O
this O
cold O
night O
wonderfully O
delicious. O

I O
don't O
want O
to O
use O
the O
words O
service, O
service, O
because O
we O
were O
not O
"served", O
but O
welcomed, O
very O
domestically. O

We O
helped O
with O
the O
order, O
advised O
good O
and O
inexpensive O
wine. B-TARGET

True, O
the O
order O
was O
not O
brought O
quickly, O
although O
in O
addition O
to O
us, O
only O
2 O
tables O
were O
occupied O
in O
the O
restaurant O
and O
people O
had O
been O
sitting O
there O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
drinking O
tea. O

Cook O
the O
salad O
for O
20 O
minutes, O
then O
wait O
for O
hot. O

We O
spent O
time O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

Guests O
liked O
the O
fireworks B-TARGET
and O
fireworks. B-TARGET

I O
took O
a O
barbecue B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill O
– O
it’s O
a O
pleasure! O

The O
salads B-TARGET
were O
tasty O
and O
pretty O
delicious, O
but O
somehow O
they O
didn’t O
remember. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
not O
enormous, O
but O
not O
small, O
we O
ate O
and O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
take O
a O
dessert O
yet, O
although O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
advised O
and O
praised O
their O
desserts. O

So, O
we O
have O
a O
reason O
to O
come O
into O
the O
apartment B-TARGET
again! O

I O
want O
to O
say O
a O
big O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
“night B-TARGET
staff” I-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
who O
made O
our O
late O
dinner O
so O
pleasant! O

On O
my O
girlfriend’s O
birthday, O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant. O

I O
chose O
"Mizuki" B-TARGET
based O
on O
reviews O
from O
this O
site, O
and O
didn't O
go O
wrong O
- O
a O
very O
cozy O
place, B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
(ordered O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
rice B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken), I-TARGET
music B-TARGET
unobtrusive O
and O
quiet. O

Service B-TARGET
- O
good, O
- O
the O
waitresses, B-TARGET
noticing O
that O
you O
look O
at O
them, O
- O
do O
not O
pretend O
that O
they O
did O
not O
notice, O
but O
fit O
:) O

Waiting O
for O
the O
order O
was O
not O
more O
than O
you O
expect O
from O
the O
restaurant O
- O
the O
plates O
appeared O
exactly O
at O
the O
moment O
when O
I O
first O
thought O
it O
was O
time O
to O
bring O
it.) O

Overall, O
we O
had O
a O
great O
evening, O
now O
I O
will O
take O
friends O
there. O

I O
was O
with O
my O
husband O
on O
the O
weekend. O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
problem O
with O
the O
table O
- O
ordered O
in O
advance. O

But O
the O
order O
was O
brought O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
- O
but O
on O
the O
street O
with O
beer O
you O
are O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
:) O

I O
liked O
the O
barbecue B-TARGET
and O
the O
beer B-TARGET
too. O

A O
small O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wines, I-TARGET
no O
classic O
beer B-TARGET
varieties. O

These O
are O
minus. O

Overall, O
the O
impression O
is O
good. O

From O
the O
service, B-TARGET
from O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
from O
the O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

People O
around O
are O
smiling, O
everyone O
is O
fun, O
music B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

We O
will O
return O
again! O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
big O
windows O
"Asahi" O
removed O
the O
deaf O
curtains O
(more O
than O
a O
year O
ago), O
this O
place O
ceased O
to O
sound O
expensive, O
tasteless O
and O
pathos. O

Two O
floors, O
very O
quiet O
but O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
itself O
unexpectedly O
disposes O
to O
spend O
time O
there O
to O
talk, O
and O
"at O
the O
same O
time" O
and O
eat. O

Since O
the O
house O
to O
go O
nearby, O
loved O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
family O
conversations: O
here O
you O
can O
hear O
the O
interlocutor, O
even O
when O
the O
hall O
is O
full O
of O
visitors. O

Service B-TARGET
at O
the O
level. O

And O
they O
meet, O
and O
accompany O
(without O
terrible O
screams O
in O
Japanese:)), O
and O
the O
order O
will O
be O
repeated, O
and O
the O
order O
of O
the O
dishes O
will O
be O
observed, O
and O
the O
ashes O
will O
be O
changed O
without O
additional O
request. O

In O
the O
menu, O
in O
addition O
to O
Japanese O
cuisine, O
there O
is O
one O
section O
with O
the O
"author" O
European, O
although O
these O
dishes O
are O
cooked O
much O
longer O
than O
Japanese. O

Sushi B-TARGET
in O
Asahi O
is O
the O
same, O
but O
they O
can O
not O
be O
ordered O
- O
there O
are O
excellent O
rolls, B-TARGET
in O
any O
of O
your O
wishes O
will O
add O
Philadelphia B-TARGET
cheese, I-TARGET
in O
addition, O
there O
are O
rolls B-TARGET
without I-TARGET
rice; I-TARGET
not O
bad O
sushi, B-TARGET
wonderful O
light O
salads B-TARGET
(with O
salmon, O
crab, O
tuna), O
portions B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
salads I-TARGET
large, O
from O
hot O
- O
hearty O
salmon B-TARGET
teriaki. I-TARGET

Of O
all O
the O
Japanese O
establishments O
in O
the O
Moscow-Elektrosil O
district, O
this O
is O
the O
most O
delicious O
crab B-TARGET
soup. I-TARGET

Up O
to O
18 O
hours, O
two O
sushis B-TARGET
for O
the O
price O
of O
one, O
plus O
free O
delivery O
of O
food O
home. O

In O
general, O
a O
decent O
place B-TARGET
can O
be O
recommended O
both O
for O
negotiations O
and O
for O
a O
romantic O
meeting. O

I O
am O
here O
at O
least O
once O
a O
week. O

Birthday O
is O
celebrated O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
November O
(15 O
November, O
Friday). O

We O
were O
five O
people. O

The O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance O
as O
well O
(cold O
snacks, O
hot O
snacks O
and O
drinks). O

We O
arrived, O
everything O
was O
ready. O

I’ve O
been O
choosing O
a O
restaurant O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

I O
really O
wanted O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
at O
a O
good O
Georgian O
restaurant. O

I O
looked O
at O
many O
options, O
read O
enough O
reviews O
on O
the O
Internet O
and O
stopped O
at O
the O
restaurant O
"KET". O

And O
it O
was O
great! O

Very O
nice, O
small O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
calm, O
warm O
colors. O

very O
cute. O

A O
few O
chairs. O

Very O
polite O
and O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
young O
man O
(unfortunately, O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
the O
name). O

It O
was O
at O
the O
highest O
level!! O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
amazing! O

I O
and O
my O
guests O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

There O
was O
also O
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

We O
danced O
a O
lot. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
we O
were O
the O
most O
active O
and O
loud O
in O
this O
regard)))) O

But O
we O
really O
wanted O
to O
dance, O
because O
the O
singer O
performed O
very O
good O
songs! B-TARGET

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
sit) O

In O
general, O
I O
am O
very O
pleased O
that O
I O
celebrated O
my O
birthday O
at O
the O
KET B-TARGET
restaurant. I-TARGET

The O
impressions O
of O
me O
and O
my O
guests O
were O
wonderful!!! O

I O
recommend O
visiting O
the O
restaurant.) B-TARGET

I O
will O
gladly O
come O
again! O

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
entire O

It O
was O
all O
very O
and O
very O
wonderful!! O

We O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
Friday. O

There O
were O
only O
a O
few O
guests O
and O
we O
ordered O
a O
table. O

Have O
a O
great O
time. O

Good O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Very O
pleased O
with O
a O
gift B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
for O
the O
young. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O

I O
advise O
everyone O
to O
go O
there, O
the O
prices O
are O
acceptable. O

And O
in O
the O
evening O
on O
Friday O
and O
Saturday O
a O
dance O
show O
and O
live O
music. O

I O
live O
near O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
often O
come O
here O
with O
family O
or O
friends, O
because O
here O
you O
can O
always O
have O
a O
delicious O
meal O
and O
a O
pleasant O
evening. O

Very O
varied O
menu, B-TARGET
so O
far O
have O
not O
tried O
it O
all. O

It O
is O
very O
pleasant O
that O
there O
is O
Japanese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Italian I-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

Suitable O
for O
everyone) O

Pasta B-TARGET
and O
sushi B-TARGET
are O
always O
great. O

I O
like O
the O
food B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill. O

No O
complaints O
about O
food. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
itself O
is O
quiet O
and O
pleasant. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
attentive, O
but O
disrespectful. O

I O
would O
love O
to O
visit O
this O
restaurant.) B-TARGET

Booked O
a O
table O
last O
weekend O
(30.08.14), O
by O
a O
small O
company. O

I O
wanted O
new O
impressions, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
we O
got O
them O
full!! O

We O
were O
served O
by O
the O
chef O
of O
the O
restaurant O
(he O
has O
a O
red O
bandage, O
the O
rest O
- O
yellow). O

A O
nice O
man, B-TARGET
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
did O
not O
understand O
Russian O
- O
we O
found O
a O
common O
language). O

Very O
virtuous, O
and O
most O
importantly O
delicious, O
he O
prepared O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
us. O

They O
watched O
with O
great O
interest O
the O
professional O
of O
their O
business. O

Honestly O
speaking, O
cooked O
cheesecake O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
similar O
to O
those O
in O
Thai O
restaurants, O
although O
the O
meat B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
unsuccessful. O

When O
booking O
a O
table O
the O
administrator O
warned O
us O
that O
in O
addition O
to O
beer, O
alcoholic O
products O
are O
not O
sold, O
but O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
bring O
with O
you, O
a O
little O
extra. O

A O
pleasant, O
non-stressing O
appearance B-TARGET
of O
the O
room, O
cozy O
and O
non-obsessive. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Oksana O
– O
she O
almost O
didn’t O
leave O
us. O

Visitors B-TARGET
to O
the O
VIP-room O
were O
very O
upset O
(shame O
on O
our O
own): O
There O
is O
a O
small O
aquarium O
in O
the O
hall, O
in O
which O
a O
fairly O
large O
fish O
is O
swimming, O
so O
one O
man, O
apparently O
a O
little O
drunk- O
from O
this O
fish O
could O
not O
be O
left O
behind, O
well O
her O
god, O
as O
if O
he O
came O
to O
the O
zoo! O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
prosperity O
to O
you! O

We O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
come O
to O
you O
again! O

I O
was O
in O
a O
restaurant O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
with O
a O
girlfriend. O

The O
situation B-TARGET
is O
decent, O
I O
personally O
like O
it, O
but O
the O
television B-TARGET
of O
the O
90s O
standing O
in O
the O
hall O
surprised O
me, O
and O
the O
picture O
is O
supplemented O
by O
an O
unworking O
fountain B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
center O
of O
the O
hall. O

The O
background B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
was O
radio. O

The O
order O
was O
received O
quickly O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
ended. O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
minutes O
to O
bring O
a O
salad. O

What O
is O
cooked O
badly O
can O
not O
be O
said, O
edible. O

Rice O
was O
also O
waiting O
with O
tea O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
minutes, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
Chinese O
restaurant, O
as O
in O
the O
east, O
we O
all O
know O
the O
dishes, O
everything O
is O
always O
decorated O
and O
looks O
very O
appetizing, O
so O
here, O
we O
brought O
the O
rice B-TARGET
on O
the O
plate O
in O
such O
a O
form O
that O
I O
even O
ate O
it. O

It O
was O
as O
if O
the O
rice B-TARGET
raised O
from O
the O
floor O
was, O
huge O
pieces. O

Then O
they O
paid O
the O
bill O
and O
left. O

We O
worked, O
there O
was O
one, O
there O
was O
another O
waitress, B-TARGET
and O
each O
thought O
we O
had O
already O
served O
and O
brought O
our O
orders. O

I O
would O
understand O
this O
if O
there O
was O
an O
anshlag, O
so O
with O
us O
in O
the O
whole O
restaurant O
3-5 O
tables O
were O
occupied. O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
Prague O
with O
a O
young O
man. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
change. O

It O
became O
very O
comfortable O
and O
comfortable. O

The O
wooden O
tables B-TARGET
and O
chairs B-TARGET
perfectly O
fit O
into O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
this O
institution. O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
also O
liked. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
friendly. O

As O
for O
the O
kitchen... O

We O
picked O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
but O
they O
were O
not O
available. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
this O
was O
caused O
by O
a O
change O
in O
the O
menu, O
because O
the O
chef O
changed, O
and O
that O
the O
new O
menu O
was O
in O
print, O
and O
therefore O
some O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
absent. O

Recommended O
to O
order O
a O
new O
salad B-TARGET
"From I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Boss" I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
breast I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
oranges I-TARGET
- O
liked, O
very O
delicious. O

They O
also O
tried O
their O
branded O
roll, B-TARGET
which O
(as O
written O
in O
the O
menu) O
is O
prepared O
according O
to O
the O
Czech O
recipe O
– O
very O
delicious!!! O

Unfortunately, O
I O
have O
never O
been O
to O
Prague, O
but O
I O
wanted O
to O
compare O
it O
to O
the O
real O
one. O

and O
beer. O

It O
was O
very O
convenient O
that O
you O
can O
order O
a O
three-litre O
tower O
at O
once, O
you O
can O
pour O
yourself O
a O
beer O
in O
a O
glass, O
drink O
Pilzner B-TARGET
- O
the O
taste O
is O
pretty O
good, O
but O
for O
me O
it O
is O
bitter, O
probably O
this O
sort. O

I O
tried O
another O
beer, B-TARGET
chose O
cherry, B-TARGET
I O
really O
liked O
its O
unusual O
taste, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
girls. O

In O
general, O
the O
evening O
was O
satisfied, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
try O
the O
dishes O
already O
from O
the O
new O
menu. O

A O
small O
and O
comfortable O
restaurant. B-TARGET

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
met O
an O
elegant O
man B-TARGET
who O
took O
up O
the O
upper O
clothes O
and O
led O
us O
into O
the O
hall. O

Later, O
looking O
at O
the O
pictures O
on O
the O
walls, O
they O
saw O
all O
of O
this O
man, O
and O
realized O
that O
it O
was O
the O
owner O
himself. O

Meeting O
guests O
host B-TARGET
is O
a O
lot O
of O
meanings, O
such O
as O
I O
have O
never O
met O
in O
Peter. O

Inside O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
quite O
cozy, O
but O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
small, O
four O
at O
one O
table O
is O
already O
tight, O
especially O
when O
you O
pick O
up O
meals. O

The O
menu O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
quite O
sophisticated, O
but O
does O
not O
shine O
with O
10 O
salads, O
10 O
second O
dishes, O
etc. O

You O
can O
say O
that O
it O
is O
even O
modest. O

But O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
there O
are O
exquisite O
and O
very O
delicious. O

There O
I O
tried O
marble O
beef O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
saw O
it O
in O
many O
restaurants, O
but O
here O
I O
still O
decided O
to O
try. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
was O
sweet, O
melting O
in O
the O
mouth! O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are I-TARGET
small, O
but O
not O
small, O
just O
that O
would O
eat O
everything O
I O
ordered. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
very O
comfortable, O
you O
feel O
at O
home. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

But O
I O
will O
say O
immediately O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
not O
cheap, O
approximately O
2000 O
rubles O
per O
person. O

Although, O
if O
you O
do O
not O
look O
at O
the O
price, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
can O
be O
safely O
recommended O
for O
a O
visit. O

I’ll O
put O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
my O
white O
list, O
and O
I’ll O
always O
have O
it O
on O
my O
list. O

It O
is O
beautiful. O

It O
tastes. O

Service B-TARGET
at O
the O
level. O

This O
“level” O
is O
focused O
on O
the O
client, O
not O
the O
client.) O

We O
arrived O
at O
23, O
on O
a O
working O
day, O
both O
of O
us O
to O
eat. O

The O
restaurant O
seemed O
empty, O
only O
looking O
at O
it O
could O
see O
visitors. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
clearly O
more O
than O
the O
guests. O

We O
went O
up O
to O
the O
second O
floor, O
a O
girl O
met O
us, O
offered O
a O
couple O
of O
small O
tables. O

We O
wanted O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
large O
table O
with O
sofas. O

I O
really O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the O
couch.) O

The O
girl B-TARGET
categorically O
said, O
“No, O
big O
tables O
are O
for O
big O
companies, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
is O
reserved.” O

Funny, O
one O
is O
busy, O
one O
is O
reserved, O
and O
a O
few O
are O
empty, O
but O
we O
can’t O
sit O
where O
we O
like O
because O
we’re O
just O
two. O

Well, O
suddenly, O
in O
this O
restaurant O
anshlag O
unexpectedly O
happens O
at O
midnight, O
it's O
okay O
not O
to O
take O
up O
so O
much O
space. O

No O
one O
appeared O
before O
the O
closure. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
really O
good. O

The O
music B-TARGET
too. O

Good O
day! O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
reading O
about O
this O
restaurant O
and O
I O
was O
so O
impressed O
by O
this O
place. B-TARGET

Excellent O
kitchen, B-TARGET
cozy O
interior, B-TARGET
friendly O
waiters, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
leave O
there O
with O
a O
bad O
mood O
and O
hungry, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
very O
large!)) O

Especially O
pleased O
with O
the O
price...quality O
food B-TARGET
for O
little O
money. O

We O
went O
with O
a O
young O
man, O
ordered O
an O
omelette B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Bavarian I-TARGET
260r., O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
cookies I-TARGET
260r., O
a O
beer B-TARGET
0.5l. O
220r. O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
250r., O
all O
together O
cost O
us O
only O
990r. O

Overall, O
the O
impression O
is O
great, O
we O
will O
come O
in O
again!!!)) O

We O
were O
with O
friends O
in O
the O
pub B-TARGET
Metropolis, I-TARGET
everything O
really O
liked. O

At O
the O
entrance O
opens O
the O
door O
Swiss, B-TARGET
then O
stand O
with O
the O
hostess, O
all O
very O
polite, O
spacious O
wardrobe, B-TARGET
beautiful O
staircase. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
on O
a O
very O
decent O
level, O
it O
feels O
like O
the O
institution B-TARGET
holds O
its O
mark. O

The O
pub O
has O
large O
wooden O
tables, B-TARGET
comfortable O
chairs, B-TARGET
there O
are O
televisions, B-TARGET
some O
concert O
was O
played O
that O
day. O

The O
obsessive O
and O
helpful O
waitress, B-TARGET
not O
even O
recorded O
our O
order, O
remembered O
everything, O
apparently O
knows O
his O
business O
:) O

I O
will O
immediately O
say O
about O
the O
prices, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
rush, O
so O
for O
a O
good O
dinner O
with O
beer, O
one O
person O
needs O
to O
have O
at O
least O
1500 O
rubles O
with O
him. O

But O
if O
you O
really O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
nice O
evening O
in O
a O
decent O
place, B-TARGET
it’s O
worth O
it. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
not O
small, O
and O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
dishes O
were O
cooked O
not O
very O
long, O
we O
did O
not O
have O
time O
to O
get O
tired O
of O
waiting. O

In O
general, O
the O
impressions O
from O
the O
pub O
are O
positive, O
thank O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
complex O
for O
trying O
to O
make O
customers O
happy!!! O

Thanks O
for O
the O
beauty B-TARGET
and O
the O
interior! B-TARGET

We O
went O
with O
a O
young O
man O
some O
Saturday O
evening, O
fearing O
there O
would O
be O
no O
seats O
- O
because O
we O
didn't O
book O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

Our O
fears O
were O
futile, O
the O
places O
were... O

And, O
more O
precisely, O
we O
entered O
an O
absolutely O
empty O
room O
- O
cute, O
semi-dark, O
with O
a O
pleasant O
decor, B-TARGET
but O
suspiciously O
deserted. O

After O
choosing O
the O
table B-TARGET
we O
liked, O
we O
sat O
down O
and O
immediately O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
appeared, O
who O
brought O
the O
menu O
and O
answered O
my O
questions O
about O
importing O
oysters. O

Immediately O
I O
will O
note O
the O
service B-TARGET
- O
nothing O
to O
do, O
everything O
is O
clear O
and O
non-obsessive; O
the O
only O
thing, O
the O
hotter O
for O
a O
long O
time O
did O
not O
carry, O
but O
this O
is O
already O
a O
little O
bit. O

So O
we O
got O
the O
oysters. O

I O
am O
fresh, O
my O
companion O
is O
baked. O

I O
can’t O
say O
it’s O
the O
best O
oysters B-TARGET
in O
my O
life, O
but O
overall, O
it’s O
not O
bad. O

As O
a O
hot B-TARGET
meal, O
the O
filet O
of O
Norwegian B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
is O
a O
wonderful O
dish. O

My O
companion, O
deciding O
not O
to O
experiment O
anymore, O
seemed O
to O
have O
taken O
a O
paste) O

Later O
I O
wanted O
more O
tea O
with O
desserts, O
but O
- O
unfortunately! O
- O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
not O
at O
all... O

Except O
for O
strawberries O
and O
ice O
cream. O

All O
very O
worthy. O

I O
won’t O
say O
I’ll O
visit O
this O
establishment O
often, O
but O
I’ll O
probably O
go O
there O
again O
someday. O

I O
was O
with O
a O
friend O
in O
this O
restaurant O
yesterday. O

We O
are O
not O
going O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

And O
the O
first O
thing O
that O
strikes O
when O
entering O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
wonderful O
very O
unusual O
interior, B-TARGET
nothing O
like O
this O
in O
the O
restaurants O
of O
our O
city O
I O
have O
not O
met. O

The O
next O
thing O
you O
pay O
attention O
to O
when O
you O
get O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
the O
very O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
always O
smiling O
and O
ready O
to O
help O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
dishes. O

The O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
about O
food. O

I O
have O
tried O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

And O
always O
like O
it O
very O
much. O

For O
example, O
yesterday O
I O
ordered O
cream B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
raviola B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushrooms. I-TARGET

The O
portions O
are O
very O
large, O
everything O
is O
delicious. O

At O
the O
Roll O
& O
Roll B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
I O
always O
confidently O
order O
new O
dishes, B-TARGET
because O
I O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
in O
my O
choice. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
offers O
a O
large O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
alcohol I-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices: B-TARGET
many O
varieties O
of O
breweries B-TARGET
and O
an O
extensive O
wine B-TARGET
map. I-TARGET

You O
can O
also O
try O
delicious O
cocktails B-TARGET
made O
by O
the O
bartender. O

The O
Roll O
& O
Roll B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
has O
become O
a O
favorite O
not O
only O
in O
this O
area, O
but O
throughout O
the O
city. O

I O
love O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
have O
been O
there O
twice O
and O
I O
think O
I O
will O
come O
again. O

Very O
delicious O
cuisine, B-TARGET
only O
the O
portions O
are O
so O
large O
that O
after O
eating O
the O
salad, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
eat O
the O
main O
dish...)) O

However, O
I O
think O
men O
will O
like O
the O
size O
of O
portions! B-TARGET

and O
good O
wine. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
- O
indeed, O
I O
liked O
the O
first B-TARGET
hall I-TARGET
more O
- O
it O
is O
more O
of O
a O
restaurant O
type, O
and O
many O
like O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
second, O
reminiscent O
of O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
a O
Greek O
tavern. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
decent O
- O
pleasant O
waitresses, B-TARGET
all O
without O
delays, O
all O
with O
a O
smile. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
pleasant. O

The O
family O
celebration O
was O
celebrated O
in O
Amadeus O
on O
May O
30. O

Finally O
found O
the O
right O
time O
to O
leave O
your O
feedback O
and O
thank O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Very O
beautiful O
and O
cozy O
fireplace, B-TARGET
beautiful O
decor B-TARGET
and O
interior! B-TARGET

It O
was O
the O
fireplace B-TARGET
we O
chose O
for O
our O
celebration. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
join O
all O
the O
positive O
feedback O
to O
the O
entire O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
work O
with O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Sergei, O
I O
want O
to O
express O
a O
special O
gratitude O
for O
his O
efforts O
and O
efforts O
in O
organizing O
and O
directly O
conducting O
the O
celebration. O

All O
our O
wishes O
and O
comments O
were O
taken O
into O
account O
by O
Sergei O
up O
to O
the O
smallest. O

Very O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
staff B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
waiters, I-TARGET
everything O
was O
during O
and, O
by O
the O
way, O
from O
serving B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
to O
elementary O
cleanliness O
at O
the O
tables. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
communicate O
with O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
- O
polite, O
smiling O
and O
friendly. O

I O
liked O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
- O
very O
beautiful O
serving B-TARGET
and O
serving B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
and O
the O
taste B-TARGET
of O
the O
dishes O
left O
the O
most O
positive O
impressions, O
it O
was O
delicious O
and O
relatively O
not O
expensive. O

Overall, O
we O
stayed O
very O
and O
very O
happy, O
THANK O
YOU O
A O
LOT!!! O

P O

S O

Well, O
I O
just O
can't O
keep O
silent O
about O
another O
pleasant O
moment O
- O
on O
the O
day O
of O
celebration O
in O
the O
restaurant O
was O
left O
a O
package O
with O
a O
gift, O
and O
which O
in O
the O
end O
hasn't O
lost O
anywhere! O

The O
next O
day O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Sergei O
contacted O
us O
and O
delighted O
us O
with O
good O
news! O

We O
came O
to O
this O
establishment O
on O
June O
4, O
2014 O
to O
eat O
shish... O

I O
ordered O
beef O
and O
pork. O

We O
sat O
waiting O
for O
the O
order O
for O
30 O
minutes, O
then O
a O
man B-TARGET
came O
to O
us O
"on O
the O
cottage" O
and O
said O
that O
he O
was O
very O
sorry O
and O
that O
the O
shashnik O
would O
soon O
be O
brought...in O
10 O
minutes O
we O
brought O
cold O
meat B-TARGET
(and O
we O
took O
2 O
different O
meals)... O

When O
we O
said O
that O
the O
shaley B-TARGET
was O
cold O
before O
us O
again O
apologized O
the O
same O
man B-TARGET
and O
offered O
to O
warm O
him O
up... O
to O
the O
taste B-TARGET
he O
was O
just O
out O
(my O
husband O
just O
did O
not O
eat O
half, O
although O
he O
usually O
eats O
everything O
that O
is O
not O
crocheted)... O

This O
is O
the O
only O
restaurant B-TARGET
we O
have O
not O
left O
for O
tea O
in O
the O
last O
5 O
years! O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
any O
food O
from O
this O
place. B-TARGET

We O
got O
the O
bill O
in O
a O
minute. O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
this O
cafe O
for O
a O
long O
time O
(the O
more O
we O
live O
nearby). O

The O
impressions B-TARGET
remained O
only O
good, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
helps O
to O
relax, O
very O
cozy. O

They O
cook O
deliciously O
and O
quickly, O
in O
my O
opinion. O

Served O
us O
a O
nice, O
fun O
girl, B-TARGET
managed O
to O
bring O
food, O
and O
cocktails O
to O
interfere, O
and O
even O
a O
discount B-TARGET
made O
us. O

That’s O
where O
I’m O
going O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O
