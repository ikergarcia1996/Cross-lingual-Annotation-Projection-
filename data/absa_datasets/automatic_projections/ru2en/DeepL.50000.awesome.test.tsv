Very O
nice, O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
modest O
prices O
for O
huge O
portions B-TARGET
of O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

We O
celebrated O
our O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
bring O
our O
own O
cake O
with O
candles. O

The O
salads B-TARGET
with O
fresh O
greens, B-TARGET
tender O
meat B-TARGET
and O
chicken, B-TARGET
and O
dessert, B-TARGET
in O
particular O
the O
Semifreddo B-TARGET
almond I-TARGET
- O
this O
is O
something O
incredibly O
delicious. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
smiling. O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
didn't O
like O
was O
that O
it O
took O
too O
long O
to O
start O
serving B-TARGET
(probably O
because O
of O
the O
great O
number O
of O
people) O
and O
no O
one O
took O
the O
dishes O
away O
from O
the O
neighbouring O
tables O
when O
people O
left. O

But O
these O
are O
trifles. O

The O
overall O
impression O
is O
great. O

Recommended! O

Excellent O
restaurant, B-TARGET
was O
here O
more O
than O
once O
and O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O

All O
the O
guests, O
me O
and O
I O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
food. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
on O
the O
level, O
everything O
was O
fresh, O
tasty O
and O
authentic). O

The O
drinks B-TARGET
we'd O
like O
to O
mention O
particularly: O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
wonderful O
and O
the O
cocktails B-TARGET
were O
absolutely O
marvellous. O

We O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
musicians B-TARGET
- O
they O
played O
sincerely O
so O
we O
did O
not O
miss O
an O
opportunity O
to O
dance. O

The O
bill O
for O
all O
this O
splendor O
was O
quite O
small O
- O
especially O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
had O
been O
sitting O
for O
6 O
hours O
and O
did O
not O
deny O
ourselves O
anything. O

Of O
small O
faults O
- O
the O
cigars B-TARGET
were O
outdated O
- O
too O
dried O
out, O
they O
forgot O
to O
serve O
a O
few O
snacks O
"in O
the O
table" O
(however, O
this O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
for O
the O
best O
- O
we O
would O
not O
have O
been O
able O
to O
eat O
them), O
the O
administrator, B-TARGET
taking O
orders O
for O
a O
banquet, O
should O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
friendly O
and O
interested O
in O
the O
process O
- O
for O
example, O
to O
help O
in O
the O
selection O
of O
dishes, O
to O
advise O
something, O
not O
just O
to O
record O
with O
a O
bored O
face. O

In O
general O
the O
party O
was O
a O
success, O
everything O
was O
at O
a O
high O
level. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
to O
you O
again! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful! O

For O
me O
this O
is O
just O
a O
perfect O
interior B-TARGET
of O
a O
small O
restaurant. O

Very O
cozy, O
somehow O
warm O
and O
at O
home, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very, O
very O
beautiful O
and O
tasteful! O

You O
don't O
want O
to O
leave! O

The O
prices O
are O
very O
good O
for O
a O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Now O
about O
the O
minuses. O

First O
of O
all O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
strange. O

Perhaps O
we O
just O
had O
an O
unpleasant O
waiter, B-TARGET
but O
his O
manner O
of O
speaking O
and O
appearance O
was O
off-putting. O

In O
addition, O
I O
was O
just O
amazed O
that O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
either O
do O
not O
speak O
English, O
or O
speak, O
but O
carefully O
conceal O
it. O

For O
some O
reason O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
only O
spoke O
to O
me, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
translate O
it O
to O
my O
foreign O
companion, O
after O
which O
he O
asked O
me O
with O
surprise O
- O
don't O
they O
speak O
English? O

For O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
city O
center O
I O
think O
this O
is O
unacceptable. O

But O
that's O
not O
all O
- O
instead O
of O
one O
soup O
they O
brought O
me O
another O
similar O
one O
without O
any O
warning. O

I O
noticed O
it O
not O
at O
once O
and O
besides O
that O
evening O
I O
had O
absolutely O
no O
desire O
to O
have O
a O
conflict, O
so O
I O
did O
not O
call O
the O
waiter O
and O
try O
to O
understand. O

As O
for O
the O
food O
I O
can O
say O
that O
I O
didn't O
like O
special O
Claret B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
I O
don't O
have O
any O
complaints O
about O
wine B-TARGET
and O
desserts, B-TARGET
I O
didn't O
buy O
meat B-TARGET
but O
my O
friend O
liked O
it. O

In O
general O
the O
impression O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
but O
it O
could O
be O
better O
if O
not O
for O
the O
strange O
service. B-TARGET

Brought O
us O
here O
a O
great O
desire O
to O
eat O
meat, O
drink O
high-quality O
beer O
and O
watch O
the O
match O
Zenit-Twente. O

Now O
in O
order. O

Went O
in-hospitable O
welcome.) B-TARGET

Pleased. O

Pretty O
blonde B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
Elena O
showed O
us O
around O
and O
offered O
us O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
only O
free O
table. O

Not O
exactly O
comfortable, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
matter. O

Because O
as O
soon O
as O
there O
was O
an O
opportunity O
to O
sit O
comfortably, O
we O
were O
immediately O
offered O
to O
sit O
down)). O

Handed O
the O
menu O
and O
gave O
us O
time O
to O
think. O

Until O
the O
girl O
came O
in, O
we O
did O
not O
think O
of O
anything( O

Thanks O
for O
the O
steak B-TARGET
"Tower" I-TARGET
first O
of O
all O
to O
the O
chef, O
very O
well O
cooked, O
in O
the O
second O
place O
to O
the O
lady B-TARGET
for O
the O
advice. O

Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
also O
pleased O
us O
very O
much, O
the O
croutons B-TARGET
were O
excellent O
(such O
croutons B-TARGET
frankly O
I O
have O
not O
eaten O
anywhere O
else). O

The O
beer B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty, O
we O
tried O
different O
kinds, O
and O
for O
three O
Velvet O
my O
friend O
got O
a O
brand-name O
towel))). O

Nice O
little O
things, O
but O
very O
satisfying. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quiet O
and O
not O
obliging O
to O
anything. O

Soft O
sofas, B-TARGET
comfortable O
which O
is O
very O
important O
now(!). O

Goes O
well O
with O
the O
size O
of O
the O
tables. O

Overall O
rating O
of O
9 O
out O
of O
10. O

Why O
9? O

Because O
the O
problems O
with O
ventilation. B-TARGET

Very O
smoky. O

But O
we O
really O
liked O
it. O

All O
were O
satisfied. O

(We O
will O
definitely O
be O
back O
again.) O

I O
wish O
you O
prosperity O
and O
success). O

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
staff.) B-TARGET

Yesterday O
I O
had O
a O
wonderful O
breakfast O
in O
a O
lovely O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
presented, O
it O
feels O
like O
home O
made. O

I O
couldn't O
agree O
more. O

I O
have O
rarely O
had O
oatmeal B-TARGET
prepared O
almost O
as O
well O
as O
I O
do O
at O
home. O

The B-TARGET
portion I-TARGET
was O
very O
decent! O

I O
also O
ordered O
a O
"Napoleon" O
to O
try. O

It B-TARGET
was O
tasty, O
a O
big O
portion, B-TARGET
but O
still O
not O
as O
good O
as O
my O
grandma O
used O
to O
make O
it... O
but O
still O
tasty. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
but O
didn't O
enthuse O
me. O

I O
think O
for O
such O
a O
place O
it's O
ok, O
you O
don't O
need O
much O
more. O

Though O
the O
sofas B-TARGET
could O
be O
more O
cozy O
and O
"homely" O
with O
cushions. O

And O
in O
some O
way O
embarrassed O
the O
glass O
door O
to O
the O
toilet, B-TARGET
given O
that O
there O
is O
a O
table O
in O
front O
of O
it O
and O
can O
sit O
visitors, O
somehow O
not O
comfortable. O

I O
expected O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
more O
"apartment", O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
more O
"cafe". O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
is O
quiet, O
it's O
hard O
to O
say O
more, O
as O
I O
was O
practically O
alone. O

I O
think O
that O
I O
will O
visit O
this O
place O
again O
for O
lunch O
and O
dinner. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place, B-TARGET
very O
good O
food, O
huge O
portions, B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
one O
hot B-TARGET
meal O
for O
four O
(!) O
and O
we O
didn't O
manage O
to O
finish O
it. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
special, O
it O
is O
clean O
and O
quiet, O
and O
the O
music O
is O
in O
the O
next O
room, O
but O
we O
wanted O
no O
music. O

Polite O
and O
helpful O
waitress, B-TARGET
you O
can O
bring O
your O
own O
alcohol, O
but O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
some O
more O
of O
it O
from O
them. O

All O
very O
much O
we O
liked O
it, O
we O
will O
come O
again)) O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
not O
cheap! O

A O
big O
minus O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
do O
not O
sell O
alcohol B-TARGET
individually, O
but O
only O
in O
cocktails! B-TARGET

At O
least O
that's O
what O
the O
bartender O
told O
me. O

Wine B-TARGET
only O
in O
small O
individual O
bottles, O
no O
beer B-TARGET
at O
all!!! O

We O
ordered O
several O
salads O
and O
they O
took O
us O
over O
an O
hour O
to O
prepare O
them, O
even O
though O
there O
was O
only O
one O
company O
at O
the O
bar O
except O
us. O

I O
don't O
understand O
what O
the O
cook O
was O
doing O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

The O
bartender B-TARGET
during O
all O
this O
time O
said O
that O
our O
salads O
are O
almost O
ready. O

In O
general, O
despite O
the O
pleasant O
interior B-TARGET
we O
don't O
want O
to O
come O
here O
anymore O
for O
some O
reason O
:( O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
great! O

So O
rare O
combination O
of O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
decent O
service. B-TARGET

And O
the O
price O
tag O
is O
very O
reasonable. O

I O
visited O
it O
with O
my O
friend. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
decent, O
met O
at O
the O
entrance, O
walked O
around O
the O
facility, O
showed O
us O
everything, O
patiently O
waited O
until O
we O
finally O
decide O
where O
to O
sit, O
though O
we O
chose O
a O
long O
time). O

Fortunately, O
had O
a O
bed). O

Filled O
with O
pillows, O
spread O
out O
in O
a O
couch, B-TARGET
in O
general, O
the O
grace. O

Food O
was O
brought O
fairly O
quickly: O
drinks O
almost O
immediately, O
salad O
in O
15 O
minutes, O
hot O
meal O
in O
10 O
minutes O
after O
salads. O

Food B-TARGET
liked, O
especially O
dessert B-TARGET
- O
napoleon, B-TARGET
very O
tasty). O

In O
general, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
previous O
review, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
there. O

By O
the O
way O
I O
ordered O
Cosmopolitan B-TARGET
- O
a O
normal O
cocktail B-TARGET
and O
plenty O
of O
alcohol. O

The O
name O
of O
the O
restaurant O
says O
that O
you O
must O
try O
this O
very O
dish B-TARGET
and O
you O
will O
be O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
variety O
of O
variations. O

We O
chose O
Chebureks B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
with O
sour B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
it O
was O
delicious! O

Very O
rich, O
delicate O
dish, B-TARGET
a O
little O
spicy, O
not O
greasy, O
I O
recommend O
it! O

Also O
was O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
trout, I-TARGET
which O
I O
would O
have O
given O
a O
7 O
out O
of O
10, O
for O
my O
taste O
was O
an O
unfortunate O
combination O
of O
ingredients, O
the O
vegetables O
gave O
too O
much O
juice, O
and O
the O
design B-TARGET
of O
the O
dish O
with O
grated O
egg O
looked O
somehow O
not O
respectable. O

The B-TARGET
pork I-TARGET
shish I-TARGET
kebab I-TARGET
was O
almost O
tasty, O
if O
it O
were O
not O
for O
the O
over-salted B-TARGET
piece I-TARGET
(one O
out O
of O
5). O

It's O
a O
pity O
we O
don't O
eat O
lamb, O
as O
it O
is O
the O
meat O
which O
dominates O
the O
menu. O

Service B-TARGET
and O
speed B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
delivery I-TARGET
we O
were O
really O
impressed, O
chebureks O
were O
brought O
in O
4 O
minutes, O
drinks O
even O
faster, O
kebab O
was O
served O
just O
in O
time, O
the O
only O
thing O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
was O
the O
change O
(in O
many O
places O
they O
wait O
from O
10 O
minutes O
and O
longer O
lately...) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
we O
relaxed O
on O
the O
benches B-TARGET
in O
front O
of O
each O
other, O
as O
if O
in O
a O
secluded O
gazebo, O
it O
was O
comfortable O
and O
no O
one O
disturbed O
us. O

When O
we O
were O
leaving O
we O
looked O
in O
all O
the O
halls O
and O
we O
liked O
the O
fireplace, B-TARGET
in O
front O
of O
which O
it O
was O
nice O
to O
spend O
a O
romantic O
evening. O

The O
light O
hall B-TARGET
was O
also O
nice O
but O
we O
thought O
that O
there O
were O
too O
many O
tables. O

Review: O
This O
place B-TARGET
is O
of O
high O
quality, O
cosy O
and O
tasty, O
and O
we'll O
keep O
coming O
back O
for O
more. O

In O
this O
shop O
we O
took O
a O
table O
and O
ordered O
a O
table B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance, O
we O
wanted O
to O
sit O
at O
another O
table O
but O
we O
were O
told O
to O
let O
somebody O
else O
sit. O

And O
we O
went O
on O
these O
very O
cold O
days. O

And O
it O
was O
cold, O
we O
were O
sitting O
in O
jackets. O

We O
were O
sitting O
in O
our O
jackets. O
People O
who O
came O
sometimes O
didn't O
look O
after O
the O
doors O
and O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
them O
to O
close O
them. O

We O
had O
to O
ask O
to O
shut O
the O
doors. O
A O
girl B-TARGET
from O
the O
staff O
felt O
sorry O
for O
us. O

We O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
rolls. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting. O

In O
other O
halls B-TARGET
more O
cozy. O
So O
in O
the O
cold O
in O
the O
hall, B-TARGET
which O
is O
at O
the O
entrance O
Better O
not O
book O
a O
table))). O

Visited O
the O
institution O
on O
February O
23. O

Welcoming, O
walked O
to O
the O
checkroom O
and O
at O
the O
table. O

On O
the O
second O
floor, O
most O
tables O
were O
occupied O
or O
standing O
reserve, O
but O
there O
was O
room O
for O
the O
three O
of O
us. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
convenient O
- O
there O
were O
separate O
grill, O
Japanese O
and O
Italian O
menus. O

As O
a O
result, O
we O
were O
sitting O
like O
monkeys O
in O
a O
shop O
with O
postcards)). O

For O
all O
the O
men O
on O
February O
23 O
a O
present-a O
shot O
of O
vodka-like O
it O
is O
not O
appropriate.... O

Mostly O
we O
ordered O
sushi. O

Drinks O
waited O
not O
very O
long O
10 O
minutes, O
but O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
orders O
all O
is O
difficult... O

At O
first O
they O
brought O
a O
salad O
for O
the O
girl, O
and O
we O
sat O
and O
licked O
our O
lips. O

Then O
soup O
for O
a O
friend, O
and O
then O
all O
the O
sushi O
(after O
30 O
minutes) O
Sushi B-TARGET
tasty, O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
- O
quite O
mediocre. O

The O
kim B-TARGET
chi I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
portion B-TARGET
is O
large. O

Impressions O
- O
cozy, O
delicious, O
large O
selection O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
to O
suit O
every O
taste O
(steaks, O
grilled O
fish, O
risotto, O
sushi, O
pizza, O
pasta, O
ear O
...). O

I O
apologize O
for O
not O
going O
into O
details O
of O
each O
course, O
because O
the O
experience O
was O
quite O
general O
and O
we O
didn't O
order O
anything O
special. O

From O
the O
table O
we O
have O
cleaned O
not O
often, O
and O
different O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
nevertheless O
all O
were O
courteous O
and O
smiling. O

We O
stayed O
with O
a O
friend O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2010 O
and O
it O
was O
a O
nice O
cafe B-TARGET
and O
we O
sat O
on O
the O
terrace. O

The O
service O
at O
first O
was O
upset: O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
put O
us O
at O
a O
table O
and O
left. O
There O
was O
no O
menu O
on O
the O
table, O
we O
expected O
that O
they O
would O
bring O
it O
to O
us, O
we O
waited O
for O
about O
10 O
minutes, O
but O
no O
one O
was O
there. O
After O
that O
he O
managed O
to O
catch O
another O
boy O
and O
ask O
him O
to O
bring O
it, O
he O
was O
shocked O
that O
we O
did O
not O
even O
have O
a O
menu O
still, O
took O
our O
order, O
brought O
food O
and O
cocktails O
quickly, O
served O
well O
and O
carefully, O
than O
corrected O
the O
initial O
negative O
impression. O

The O
food O
is O
ordinary O
in O
my O
opinion, O
nothing O
special, O
but O
the O
prices O
are O
clearly O
overpriced. O

The B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
loaf I-TARGET
is O
really O
delicious, O
"homemade" O
:) O
I O
would O
come O
again O
for O
the O
desserts. B-TARGET

And O
just O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
sit O
and O
talk. O

Another O
thing O
I'd O
like O
to O
mention O
- O
concerning O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
- O
it's O
a O
bit O
crowded. O

It's O
not O
very O
nice O
to O
sit O
almost O
right O
up O
to O
the O
other O
tables O
and O
have O
to O
listen O
to O
other O
people's O
conversations. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
men O
who O
sit O
and O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
look O
from O
top O
to O
bottom, O
as O
if O
for O
them O
and O
came O
to O
exhibit. O

I O
get O
the O
impression O
that O
both O
men O
and O
ladies O
go O
there O
just O
to O
look O
for O
an O
easy O
acquaintance. O

Other O
than O
that, O
it's O
very O
nice.) O

We O
stopped O
by O
for O
dinner O
in O
the O
evening. O

We O
were O
offered O
a O
vip-cabinet O
(see O
the O
photo O
gallery O
of O
the O
restaurant). O

We O
liked O
it O
very O
much: O
interior, B-TARGET
service, B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
invite O
our O
friends O
to O
celebrate O
the O
birthday O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Administrator B-TARGET
Victoria O
immediately O
made O
a O
menu, O
took O
into O
account O
all O
our O
wishes, O
gave O
advice O
on O
the O
banquet. O

The O
meeting O
of O
friends O
(there O
were O
eight O
of O
us) O
was O
great O
- O
we O
were O
all O
very O
happy. O

And O
a O
beautiful O
private O
room B-TARGET
(see O
gallery O
photo), O
and O
attentive, O
but O
unobtrusive O
staff B-TARGET
and O
the O
original O
cuisine B-TARGET
(we O
took O
eight O
different O
hot B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
and O
everyone O
claimed O
that O
he O
had O
the O
most O
delicious) O
- O
everything O
was O
just O
"super". O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
a O
wonderful O
evening, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
again. O

P.S.By O
the O
way: O
great O
website B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
menu! B-TARGET

Our O
wedding O
banquet O
was O
held O
on O
July O
10. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
say O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
and O
especially O
to O
the O
receptionist B-TARGET
Elena O
for O
the O
wonderful O
service. B-TARGET

We O
chose O
our O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time, O
we O
didn't O
regret O
our O
choice. O

From O
the O
pluses O
I O
would O
mention O
a O
wonderful O
location B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
(it O
is O
especially O
important O
if O
our O
guests O
come O
from O
other O
cities). O

I O
liked O
the O
food B-TARGET
itself O
and O
the O
chef B-TARGET
was O
a O
miracle! O
We O
chose O
the O
menu O
for O
1500 O
per O
person, O
ordered O
a O
dish O
from O
the O
chef O
and O
a O
salad, O
but O
even O
without O
our O
additions O
the O
treat B-TARGET
would O
have O
been O
enough. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
very O
appropriate O
atmosphere B-TARGET
for O
wedding O
events, O
so O
cozy O
and O
festive! O

We O
had O
32 O
guests O
and O
everyone O
had O
a O
very O
good O
experience. O

Thank O
you! O

Alfia O
and O
Ivan. O

We O
often O
visit O
Tan O
Zhen O
on O
Bolshoi O
Prospekt O
V.O. O

The O
impressions O
are O
only O
positive. O
( O
The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
modest, O
noisy, O
but) O

At O
the O
weekend O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
get O
in, O
so O
you O
better O
book O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

A O
few O
times O
we O
came O
in O
at O
the O
weekend O
without O
an O
order, O
but O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
was O
always O
able O
to O
find O
a O
free O
table O
in O
my O
opinion)))). O

I O
really O
like O
the O
service: B-TARGET
fast, O
huge O
portions B-TARGET
and O
waiters B-TARGET
who O
are O
always O
helpful. O

We O
ordered O
a O
banquet O
hall. O

We O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
individual O
approach O
to O
our O
guests. O

It O
would O
be O
better O
to O
visit O
in O
company: O
we O
usually O
order O
two O
salads O
and O
two O
hot O
dishes O
for O
four O
people. O

My O
favourite O
dishes O
are O
salad B-TARGET
Troika, I-TARGET
squid B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and O
tongue. B-TARGET

I O
think O
you O
should O
go O
here O
just O
because O
of O
the B-TARGET
specialty: I-TARGET
eggplant B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
soy I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

And O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
very O
tasty: O
fruit B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
caramel! I-TARGET

In O
general, O
a O
soulful O
place B-TARGET
... O

Wanted O
to O
have O
dinner O
with O
a O
girl, O
but O
we O
were O
out O
of O
luck O
- O
it O
was O
the O
day O
they O
had O
a O
power O
outage. O

The O
girl O
who O
served O
us O
said O
that O
the O
kitchen O
can't O
offer O
us O
any O
hot O
dishes O
(as O
well O
as O
some O
cold O
ones). O

We O
couldn't O
order O
anything O
hot, O
so O
I O
won't O
rate O
the O
kitchen, O
but O
the O
food O
we O
ordered O
left O
neither O
positive O
nor O
negative O
impressions. O

We O
ordered O
a O
Caesar O
salad, O
cheese O
plate, O
a O
girl O
took O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
"Bardo" O
and O
I O
took O
lemonade O
as O
I O
was O
driving. O

It O
looked O
very O
comical O
as O
the O
waiter O
poured O
lemonade O
from O
a O
bottle O
into O
a O
wine O
glass O
for O
me O
:) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
I O
liked O
it. O

It O
was O
very O
romantic O
sitting O
on O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
and O
looking O
at O
the O
canal... O

Probably O
because O
you O
can O
only O
see O
the O
canal, O
but O
as O
already O
written O
before O
me, O
you O
can O
have O
fun O
watching O
the O
students O
of O
the O
evening O
Finec. O

It O
is O
winter O
and O
it O
was O
quite O
cold O
on O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
so O
the O
girl O
was O
very O
cold. O

Each O
chair O
has O
a O
plaid O
on O
it, O
but O
even O
they O
didn't O
save O
the O
day. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
our O
order O
was O
not O
a O
large O
order O
it O
was O
served O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
if O
not O
to O
say O
VERY O
long. O

I O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
during O
this O
time O
they O
have O
grown O
new O
grapes O
and O
made O
wine O
from O
them. O

I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
mention O
a O
peculiarity O
of O
the O
menu O
which O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
peaches. O

I O
hope O
to O
come O
here O
again O
when O
it's O
warm O
and O
the O
place O
is O
light. O

Had O
a O
visit O
to O
this O
cafe O
today. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
special, O
but O
cozy. O

Soft O
and O
peaceful O
music B-TARGET
is O
playing. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
good. O

Had O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
(I O
think O
the O
name O
was O
Linda) O
- O
delicious, O
but O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
was O
over-salted. O

And O
of O
course, O
having O
read O
reviews O
about O
napoleon, O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
it! O

Very O
tasty, O
the O
cream B-TARGET
is O
not O
greasy, O
tender. O

And O
most O
importantly, O
it's O
not O
very O
sweet, O
as O
it O
happens. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
desserts B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
(for O
those O
who O
like O
sweets, B-TARGET
you'll O
have O
plenty O
to O
choose O
from)), O
and O
you O
should O
try O
something O
else. O

All O
in O
all, O
it's O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
and O
as O
long O
as O
you O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
it's O
a O
cafe, O
it's O
a O
really O
good O
place. O

Yesterday O
we O
went O
to O
Tokyo, O
on O
our O
way O
from O
Mirage, O
we O
went O
to O
Eurasia O
first... O
But O
it's O
a O
good O
thing O
we O
didn't O
have O
any O
seats O
there! O

I O
remembered O
from O
the O
resto-club O
that O
Tokyo O
was O
next O
door, O
so O
we O
went O
there! O

I O
liked O
the O
large O
room B-TARGET
with O
lots O
of O
comfortable O
sofas O
and O
a O
good O
conversation O
zone, O
without O
the O
noise O
and O
loud O
music. O

It O
seemed O
that O
the B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
still O
wandering O
around O
the O
place, O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
menu O
for O
about O
5 O
minutes. O

It O
was O
just O
enough O
time O
to O
have O
a O
look O
around.) O

Nice O
enough O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Were O
unexpectedly O
pleased O
with O
the O
action O
2 O
for O
the O
price O
of O
1! O

But O
most O
importantly O
(compared O
with O
Eurasia O
(free O
hours)) O
everything O
was O
very O
tasty O
there! O

I O
ordered O
spicy O
seafood B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
big O
portions, B-TARGET
quite O
spicy, O
loved O
it! O

Mussels B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
spicy I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
, O
very O
good, O
reminded O
me O
of O
mussels O
from O
2 O
sticks. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
order O
of O
chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mashed I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
- O
very O
nice O
fillet, B-TARGET
very O
tender O
and O
with O
big O
portions B-TARGET
(to O
be O
honest O
I O
was O
surprised, O
I O
thought O
that O
since O
the O
action O
was O
so O
large, O
everything O
was O
smaller). O

Sushi O
will O
not O
describe, O
because O
different O
and O
to O
the O
lover! O

I O
liked O
the O
shrimp, B-TARGET
filadelfia I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
vegetables. I-TARGET

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
keep O
it O
up!!!! O

I O
would O
love O
to O
go O
back! O

Open O
such O
a O
place O
in O
Ozerki O
or O
somewhere O
in O
the O
North O
nearby)))) O

Terrible O
service B-TARGET
!!! O

Until O
today O
I O
had O
a O
good O
impression O
of O
this O
bar, O
but O
the O
waiter O
we O
tried O
to O
book O
a O
table O
with O
treated O
me O
just O
disgustingly. O

When O
asked O
if O
they O
have O
non-smoking O
seats, O
he O
insolently O
stated O
(while O
wiggling O
at O
the O
same O
time) O
that O
if O
we O
want O
non-smoking O
seats, O
then O
you O
should O
go O
to O
a O
cafe O
nearby, O
not O
to O
us! O

And O
left, O
even O
though O
we O
weren't O
done O
talking O
to O
him!!!! O

I'll O
never O
go O
there O
again! O

It's O
a O
horrible O
place! B-TARGET

I O
read O
all O
the O
reviews O
below O
and O
still O
decided O
to O
go O
and O
eat O
there O
with O
my O
girlfriend. O

As O
expected, O
called, O
ordered O
a O
table. O
Asked O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
cozy. O

We O
came. O

We O
had O
the O
best O
table O
in O
my O
opinion. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
cool. O

We O
sat O
down. O

We O
sat O
down... O
Five O
more O
minutes... O

Not O
even O
a O
menu. O

Got O
the O
waiter. O

The O
menu O
was O
brought. O
but O
no O
ashtray. B-TARGET

In O
10-15 O
minutes, O
came O
to O
take O
orders O
(already O
another O
waiter). B-TARGET

Accepted, O
in O
about O
15-20 O
minutes O
brought O
the O
order. O

И... O

Gone... O

There O
was O
no O
full O
house, O
but O
we O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
they O
didn't O
remember O
us. O
They O
brought O
us O
an O
ashtray B-TARGET
(which O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for) O
for O
the O
entire O
evening. O

They O
didn't O
change O
it O
once!!!!!!! O

During O
the O
entire O
evening O
we O
were O
playing O
a O
game O
"Catch O
me O
if O
you O
can" O
with O
the B-TARGET
waiter. I-TARGET

And O
when O
we O
managed O
to O
call O
another O
waiter, B-TARGET
she O
refused O
to O
accept O
the O
order, O
as O
we O
are O
not O
her O
table. O
(The O
truth O
called O
our O
waiter O
after O
three O
minutes). O

Asked O
for O
the O
bill. O
paid. O
and O
do O
not O
bring O
change. O

I O
certainly O
understand O
that O
the O
tip O
and O
everything, O
but O
their O
size O
I O
want O
to O
determine O
myself O
(change O
was O
300 O
rubles). O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
to O
bring O
change. O

Bottom O
line. O

Interior B-TARGET
10 O
points. O

Cuisine B-TARGET
7 O
points. O

Service B-TARGET
1 O
(or O
even O
zero.) O

Because O
of O
this O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
will O
go O
back O
there O
again. O
Our O
bill O
for O
two O
was O
3700 O
rubles. O
- O
The O
alternative O
is O
a O
foam O
bar. O

Recommendation: O
Teach O
the O
staff B-TARGET
to O
work O
at O
least O
normally! O

Last O
Sunday O
we O
went O
to O
Metropol O
quietly O
to O
celebrate O
our O
wedding O
anniversary. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
surprise. O

As O
a O
rule O
before O
visiting O
restaurants O
for O
the O
first O
time O
I O
try O
to O
get O
acquainted O
with O
them O
through O
sites, O
look O
through O
menus, O
well, O
to O
understand O
where O
we O
are O
going O
and O
what O
to O
expect, O
both O
from O
the O
cuisine, O
and O
from O
the O
pricing. O

So O
just O
the O
first O
impression O
of O
the O
restaurant O
surprised O
me: O
in O
spite O
of O
rather O
democratic O
prices O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
well O
done O
and O
makes O
an O
impression O
of O
luxury, O
probably O
even O
expensive... O

In O
general O
I O
did O
not O
expect. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
polite, O
starting O
from O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
downstairs O
and O
ending O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
waiters. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

The O
presentation B-TARGET
is O
interesting O
and O
clever O
- O
the O
food O
WANTED O
to O
be O
eaten). O

The O
taste O
does O
not O
lag O
behind, O
for O
example O
really O
liked O
the O
smoked B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shuffles, I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
caviar I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
"chantilly. I-TARGET
The O
fish B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
(I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
they O
salt O
it O
or O
not), O
the O
combination O
of O
ingredients B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

The O
beer B-TARGET
is O
good, O
I O
would O
not O
say O
that O
it O
is O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city, O
but O
on O
a O
level O
(my O
personal O
subjective O
opinion) O
with O
the O
most O
tasty O
beer O
that O
I O
have O
tasted O
in O
Petersburg... O

Even O
left O
a O
little O
review O
in O
the O
magic O
book. O

In O
the O
near O
future O
we O
will O
go O
there O
again O
for O
a O
more O
thorough O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
menu) O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Without O
much O
fanfare. O

Cozy, O
more O
or O
less B-TARGET
quiet, I-TARGET
has I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
relaxing I-TARGET
atmosphere. O

Just O
like O
at O
the O
cottage. O

On O
the O
menu: O
the O
most O
excellent O
steak B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
oil. I-TARGET

Salads B-TARGET
are O
almost O
all O
good. O

Good O
dessert B-TARGET
with O
blueberries. O

Were O
at O
the O
opening, O
noticed O
this O
place. O

We O
went O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
when O
it O
was O
really O
small. O

Could O
do O
with O
a O
10 O
in O
that O
kind O
of O
atmosphere. O

But O
when O
we O
came O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
the O
band O
Ivanushki O
were O
playing, O
it O
got O
worse. O

The O
hall O
was O
full, O
but O
there O
were O
couple O
of O
empty O
tables O
and O
waiters B-TARGET
couldn't O
cope O
with O
it O
and O
took O
their O
time. O

There O
was O
a O
problem O
with O
cocktails: B-TARGET
a O
strawberry B-TARGET
margarita I-TARGET
was O
not O
strawberry O
at O
all O
but O
with O
syrup. O

For O
some O
reason O
they O
added O
to O
the O
bill O
something O
that O
we O
didn't O
order. O

But O
it O
didn't O
spoil O
our O
mood, O
because O
everything O
was O
saved O
by O
Ivanushki. O

In O
summary: O
we O
liked O
it. O

I O
will O
definitely O
be O
coming O
back O
to O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
like O
visiting O
friends, O
thanks O
to O
a O
warm O
attitude, O
and O
perhaps O
even O
the O
chef. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday! O

I O
chose O
Roll&Roll. O

Was O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

Great O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
nice O
and O
cosy O
sofas B-TARGET
and O
good O
lighting B-TARGET
(not O
too O
much O
bother). O

I O
booked O
the O
table O
on O
Saturday O
morning O
for O
tonight. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
advised O
me O
to O
make O
a O
pre-order, O
told O
me O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
recommended O
dishes. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
cooked O
deliciously. O

Hot O
stuff O
was O
brought B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
time. I-TARGET

In O
general, O
the O
guys O
liked O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
Andrey, O
thank O
him O
very O
much, O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
look O
for O
him. O

For O
the O
money, O
I O
was O
even O
pleasantly O
surprised O
- O
not O
too O
expensive. O

Think O
about O
it O
for O
6 O
people O
for O
7500 O
rubles. O

Great O
place. B-TARGET

Great O
food. B-TARGET

My O
husband O
works O
nearby. O
We O
decided O
to O
come O
here O
to O
celebrate O
our O
personal O
holiday. O

Nice O
interior B-TARGET
-very O
bright O
at O
heart O
and O
cozy. O

Well O
done O
10! O
Great O
service B-TARGET
sweetest O
waitress B-TARGET
(I O
think O
Elfira) O
beautiful O
girl. O
Attentive. O
Even O
at O
my O
request, O
scissors O
(I O
had O
to O
cut O
a O
piece O
of O
plaster) O
immediately O
brought O
clean O
tablecloths, B-TARGET
change B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tableware, I-TARGET
very O
nice O
serving B-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

A O
pity O
there O
was O
no O
mutton B-TARGET
shashlik I-TARGET
- O
but O
they O
have O
just O
opened, O
I O
think O
the O
menu O
will O
grow! O
And O
I O
tried O
a O
piece O
of O
pork O
with O
my O
husband O
- O
tender, O
juicy, O
haven't O
eaten O
anything O
like O
that O
for O
ages O
and O
not O
overdried, O
as O
usual)))) O
Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
- O
the O
most O
delicious O
version O
in O
my O
whole O
life O
(and O
I O
have O
never O
tasted O
Caesar!) O
And O
very O
tasty O
kvass. B-TARGET
Everything O
that O
we O
ordered O
we O
liked, O
and O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
are O
extremely O
picky O
eaters. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
wish O
this O
restaurant O
to O
develop O
and O
not O
deteriorate. O

On O
leaving O
we O
received O
a O
card. O

Just O
cards O
don't O
do O
that-that O
means O
wait O
for O
more O
and O
more! O

Celebrated O
our O
wedding O
in O
this O
restaurant O
05.08.2010. O

Very O
nice, O
cozy O
and O
calm O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Really O
family O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Attentive O
staff, B-TARGET
super O
service! B-TARGET

Consider O
all O
the O
wishes!!! O

Cooking O
is O
great! O

Very O
tasty O
food, B-TARGET
all O
of O
the O
quality, O
excellent O
meat B-TARGET
!!! O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
left O
a O
great O
impression O
!!!! O

We O
were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
April O
26. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
very O
cozy. O

I O
liked O
the O
people B-TARGET
there. O

There O
were O
foreigners O
and O
students O
sitting O
there. O

Different O
people O
and O
everyone O
had O
a O
good O
welcome. B-TARGET

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
tasted O
and O
sounded O
good O
and O
looked O
good. O

When O
we O
tried O
it O
we O
saw O
for O
ourselves. O

We O
had O
khachapuri, O
suluguni O
cheese, O
pork, O
and O
seafood O
salad. O

Everything O
is O
tasty. O

I O
liked O
more O
the O
khachapuri B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese. I-TARGET

Either O
because O
I O
was O
hungry, O
or O
because O
it O
was O
really O
delicious..... O

We O
drank O
Georgian O
wine. O

It O
was O
also O
quite O
good. O

The O
average O
bill O
was O
quite O
decent, O
but O
only O
because O
of O
the O
wine. O

I O
think O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
decent O
and O
inexpensive. O

There O
is O
background O
music O
playing. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
polite O
and O
friendly. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
romantic. O

Cooking O
is O
good. O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviews: O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
together. O

For O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
a O
hotel O
I O
think O
it O
is O
too O
dark O
and O
somewhat O
gloomy O
inside, O
but O
outdoors O
it O
is O
nice O
with O
wooden B-TARGET
tables I-TARGET
and O
chairs B-TARGET
under I-TARGET
umbrellas I-TARGET
and O
fresh B-TARGET
air I-TARGET
- O
that's O
where O
we O
are O
staying. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
didn't O
understand O
what O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
do, O
I O
didn't O
see O
a O
smile, O
a O
sparkle O
in O
her O
eyes O
or O
any O
advice O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
dishes. O

It O
was O
as O
if O
they O
were O
not O
happy O
that O
we O
are O
here. O

All O
right, O
I O
asked O
about O
the O
kebab: O
"Will O
it O
take O
long O
to O
make?" O
He O
answers, O
"No, O
not O
many O
people, O
not O
long." O
I O
order. O

Well, O
not O
to O
lie O
shashlik O
me O
exactly O
an O
hour, O
if O
not O
more. O

Heard O
from O
friends O
that O
the O
shashlik O
there O
is O
delicious. O

I O
did O
not O
like O
it O
at O
all, O
dry O
meat, B-TARGET
though O
the O
red B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
shashlyk O
tasty. O

Cold B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
"Lapin I-TARGET
Kulta" I-TARGET
was O
also O
nice. O

As O
for O
the O
rest O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
not O
to O
our O
liking, O
something O
was O
missing O
in O
it, O
and O
the O
pike-perch B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
tempura I-TARGET
was O
not O
what O
we O
liked. O

We O
asked O
for O
cold O
wine, O
they O
said O
yes, O
but O
they O
brought O
it O
almost O
from O
under O
the O
heater. O

Ice B-TARGET
cream O
was O
nice O
and O
green B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lemon. I-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
is O
very O
unobtrusive. O

They O
go O
into O
the O
restaurant O
and O
after O
some O
time O
come O
out O
to O
see O
if O
anyone O
needs O
anything. O

We O
wanted O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
bill O
and O
already O
thought O
that O
they O
seem O
to O
have O
curled O
up O
already))). O

But O
we O
had O
a O
good O
time, O
because O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
the O
company! O

We O
were O
at O
your O
restaurant O
with O
a O
large O
group, O
celebrating O
our O
birthday. O

I O
liked O
your O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice! O

I O
can O
say O
that O
everything O
was O
on O
the O
level, O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
!!! O

Very O
nice O
music, B-TARGET
I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
music O
that O
suits O
everyone O
and O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
makes O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
longer, O
especially O
if O
you O
have O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
our O
waiter B-TARGET
Vusal. O

Next O
birthday O
party O
will O
definitely O
be O
at O
your O
place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

THANKS O
A O
LOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
am O
writing O
a O
review O
about O
this O
restaurant O
as O
it O
is O
impossible O
not O
to O
write O
it. O

Celebrated O
our O
wedding O
on O
August O
17 O
for O
45 O
people. O

We O
and O
our O
guests O
were O
delighted O
with O
everything. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
varied, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
top-notch! O

By O
the O
way O
there O
was O
so O
much O
food B-TARGET
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
we O
got O
the O
rest O
to O
go O
with O
us. O

And O
we O
liked O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
even O
more, O
they O
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
polite! O

Special O
thanks O
to O
waiter B-TARGET
Vladimir O
for O
his O
patience O
and O
care O
while O
serving O
our O
elderly O
relatives. O

They O
still O
remember O
you O
with O
kind O
words))) O
!!!! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
holiday! O

I O
will O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
I O
know! O

I O
really O
like O
this O
place. B-TARGET

As O
many O
years O
ago, O
service B-TARGET
at O
a O
high O
level. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
so O
smiling O
and O
attentive, O
always O
check O
if O
you O
liked O
everything, O
whether O
you O
need O
anything O
else, O
and O
if O
you O
ask, O
recommend O
something. O

They O
serve O
quickly O
and O
unobtrusively. O

The O
interior, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
is O
up O
to O
a O
connoisseur's O
taste, O
but O
I O
like O
cosier O
places. O

But O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
good O
and O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
such O
a O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
tasty O
food B-TARGET
I'm O
ready O
to O
come O
back O
again O
and O
again. O

Last O
time O
I O
had O
the O
salad O
with O
mozzarella O
and O
jamon. O

Very O
tasty O
salad. B-TARGET

And O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

Cheese O
toasted O
in O
sesame O
seeds, O
and O
tender O
chicken B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
perfectly O
complements O
the O
sweetish O
orange B-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

I O
highly O
recommend O
it. O

A O
friend O
ordered O
veal B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
a O
bone O
and O
was O
also O
very O
pleased. O

I O
recommend O
Las O
Torres O
restaurant, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
really O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
and O
have O
a O
good O
time. O

The O
only O
place B-TARGET
close O
to O
home, O
which O
is O
open O
until O
6 O
am O
and O
where O
you O
do O
not O
need O
to O
go O
by O
car. O

There O
is O
a O
separate O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
. O

A O
lot O
of O
tables B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
couches I-TARGET
. O

Always O
meet O
and O
greet O
and O
walk O
you O
to O
your O
table. O

Advise O
when O
choosing O
a O
dish. O

Constantly O
different O
promotions O
on O
weekdays, O
for O
example O
until O
6 O
pm, O
2 O
dishes O
for O
the O
price O
of O
1. O

Now O
there O
is O
also O
an O
Italian O
menu, O
but O
to O
try O
it O
yet O
dared O
not. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
they O
can O
bring O
both O
soup O
and O
rolls O
at O
once O
and O
if O
the O
rolls O
are O
hot, O
they O
have O
time O
to O
get O
cold. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
good O
in O
9 O
out O
of O
10 O
cases. O

The O
delivery B-TARGET
is O
also O
good, O
not O
once O
was O
not O
such O
that O
something O
was O
not O
given O
or O
not O
that. O

Always O
arrive O
at O
the O
agreed O
upon O
time. O

In O
general, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
places B-TARGET
in O
our O
neighborhood. O

Very O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

Sitting O
there O
with O
a O
young O
man, O
took O
a O
pizza O
for O
two. O

I O
do O
not O
remember O
what O
it O
was O
called, O
but O
I O
remember O
that O
it O
was O
mushroom. O

Pretty O
tasty O
and O
the O
dough, B-TARGET
as O
rightly O
suggested O
the B-TARGET
waitress, I-TARGET
not O
thin, O
not O
thick, O
but O
just O
right! O
The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
tasty, O
very O
well O
felt O
the O
white O
mushrooms, O
but O
it O
seemed O
a O
little O
bland, O
so O
9. O

The O
design B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
pretty O
bright O
room O
for O
non-smokers O
and O
a O
darker O
room O
for O
smokers. O

We O
sat O
in O
the O
non-smoking O
room O
by O
the O
window, O
very O
cozy O
and O
the O
light O
colors O
of O
the O
room B-TARGET
enhance O
the O
mood. O

I've O
seen O
bad O
reviews O
about O
the O
staff.... O

In O
turn, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
I O
want O
to O
praise. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
was O
a O
very O
nice O
lady O
and O
friendly O
person. O
The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
quick O
to O
come O
up O
and O
offer O
advice O
on O
the O
menu. O

I O
liked O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
very O
much. O

And O
for O
those O
who O
haven't O
tried O
the O
wonderful O
drink O
Limoncello, B-TARGET
I O
advise O
you O
to O
try O
it! O

I O
was O
delighted, O
but O
I O
tried O
a O
creamy B-TARGET
limoncello. I-TARGET

In O
a O
restaurant O
it O
costs O
140 O
rubles O
per O
50gr, O
which O
is O
quite O
an O
acceptable O
price O
for O
this O
drink! B-TARGET

Thank O
you! O

I O
have O
been O
thinking O
for O
a O
long O
time O
about O
where O
to O
go O
to O
celebrate O
my O
husband's O
parents O
anniversary. O

Wanted O
seafood, O
interesting O
new O
interior. O

Of O
all O
the O
(not O
very O
large) O
list O
of O
new O
institutions O
of O
this O
kind O
was O
chosen O
restaurant O
"Massmidia". O
I O
love O
seafood. O
but O
unfortunately O
we O
do O
not O
have O
many O
places O
where O
they O
can O
offer O
such O
a O
variety O
of O
Mussels. O

And O
basically O
all O
of O
them O
have O
been O
explored O
up O
and O
down. O

My O
husband's O
parents O
are O
great O
lovers O
of O
seafood. O

So O
the O
main O
thing O
for O
us O
was O
to O
make O
them O
happy. O

And O
we O
(and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
staff) O
succeeded). O

Great O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
pleasant O
staff B-TARGET
created O
a O
great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
for O
our O
little O
family O
party. O

Were O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
at O
this O

June O
10 O

an O

and O
the O
unusual O
smoked O
duck O
and O
celery... O

Very O

Everything O

We O
will O
come O

times... O

We O
came O
here O
the O
other O
day O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
with O
a O
small O
group. O

I O
liked O
it O
VERY O
much, O
the O

the O
white O

advised O
what O
sauces O
should O
be O
served O
with O
what, O
offered O
tea O
and O
said O
that O
the O

big O
(and O
they O
were, O
we O
didn't O
even O
manage O
to O
eat O
everything). O

I O
saw O
that O
the O
restaurant O
owner O
himself O
walked O
around O
the O
restaurant, O
probably O
to O
see O
if O
the O
guests O
are O
happy. O

There O
were O
a O
few O
other O
companies O
in O
addition O
to O
us. O

The O
rice B-TARGET
was O
well O
done, O
eggplant B-TARGET
too, O
everything O
was O
seasoned O
moderately, O
nothing O
too O
spicy O
or O
salty. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
flatbread I-TARGET
was O
as O
hot O
as O
out O
of O
the O
oven! O

No O
one O
was O
standing O
over O
our O
heads, O
as O
they O
say, O
and O
they O
didn't O
snatch O
our O
plates O
out O
of O
our O
hands.) O

We O
sat O
long O
enough, O
nobody O
hurried O
us. O

Wanted O
to O
try O
a O
dessert O
"Indian O
cheesecake" O
but O
it O
has O
not O
got O
down, O
I O
will O
leave O
for O
the O
next O
time O
(I O
do O
not O
doubt O
that O
the O
next O
time O
is O
not O
far O
off). O

The O
experience O
is O
very O
pleasant! O

Driving O
to O
work, O
I O
look O
out O
the O
window: O
stores, O
crossroads, O
the O
park... O
I O
see O
a O
sign O
"...we're O
open!" O
or O
something O
like O
that. O

I O
looked O
closely, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Sticks" I-TARGET
Japanese O
and O
Italian O
cuisine, O
well, O
I O
think, O
go O
in O
... O
it O
would O
be O
better O
not O
to O
go O
in. O

First, O
no O
one O
met, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
"navigate O
the O
area". O

The O
restaurant O
was O
empty, O
there O
were O
no O
guests. O

I O
chose O
a O
table O
near O
the O
window, O
sat O
down, O
and O
waited O
for O
the O
menu. O

They O
noticed O
me O
pretty O
quickly, O
and O
with O
a O
big O
smile O
on O
their O
face... O
No... O
they O
didn't O
serve O
me O
the O
menu, O
but O
asked O
me O
to O
sit O
down, O
as O
the O
table O
was O
for O
large O
company O
(at O
1 O
p.m. O
on O
a O
weekday!), O
but O
okay. O

Secondly, O
they O
didn't O
help O
me O
with O
the O
choice, O
so O
I O
ordered O
it O
myself. O

And O
I O
ordered O
pasta O
with O
salmon, O
Greek O
salad O
and O
cocktail. O

Thirdly, O
both O
dishes O
were O
served O
at O
the O
same O
time O
without O
asking O
me! O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
not O
tasty O
and O
too O
salty, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
was O
not O
good O
(too O
much O
oil). B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
was O
weird O
and O
cheesy, O
the O
furniture B-TARGET
was O
not O
comfortable, O
and O
you O
should O
ask O
for O
ashtrays. B-TARGET

In O
my O
opinion O
"stick" O
needs O
to O
be O
renamed O
to O
a O
cafe O
as O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
far O
away O
and O
not O
even O
visible. O
Or O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
service, I-TARGET
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
halls O
and O
of O
course O
the O
quality O
of O
cooking O
and O
serving O
ITALIAN B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

I O
join O
the O
positive O
reviews. O

Of O
course O
it O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
in O
the O
full O
sense O
of O
the O
word O
but O
it O
is O
an O
excellent O
cafe B-TARGET
with O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
reasonable O
prices. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
large, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
we O
had O
a O
salad, O
the O
first O
course, O
the O
second O
course O
and O
the O
compote O
- O
we O
could O
hardly O
crawl O
out O
of O
the O
table. O

There O
was O
a O
good O
choice O
of O
main B-TARGET
courses O
and O
soups B-TARGET
and O
we O
also O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
pastries. B-TARGET

An O
interior B-TARGET
quite O
corresponds O
to O
a O
status, O
a O
unique O
minus- O
really, O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
which O
of O
halls B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
nonsmokers, I-TARGET
whether O
everywhere O
smoke, O
whether O
the B-TARGET
extractor I-TARGET
fan O
bad O
works. O

In O
general, O
we O
used O
to O
go O
there O
once O
a O
week O
for O
lunch O
when O
we O
were O
in O
those O
parts O
of O
the O
country O
for O
work. O

And O
we O
noticed O
that O
we O
were O
looking O
forward O
to O
that O
very O
day! O

The O
restaurant O
is O
not O
a O
large O
one, O
I O
understood O
from O
the O
atmosphere O
that O
regular O
customers O
go O
there))). O

The B-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
made O
wonderful O
desserts B-TARGET
Tiramisu I-TARGET
)))))). O

I O
advise!!! O
all O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
served O
on O
large O
and O
heavy O
plates B-TARGET
not O
the O
usual O
shape)))))) O

This O
restaurant O
was O
a O
top O
ten O
Japanese O
restaurant, O
but O
I've O
had O
better O
sushi. O

They O
certainly O
are O
big O
and O
juicy, O
but O
the O
same O
as O
everywhere O
else, O
and O
there O
is O
almost O
no O
choice( O

The O
menu O
has O
no O
pictures, O
and O
everyone O
is O
so O
accustomed O
to O
choose O
dishes O
by O
them))))) O

It's O
so O
quiet O
and O
cozy. O

Well, O
this O
place O
is O
more O
of O
a O
theme O
cafe O
and O
not O
a O
restaurant. O

The O
Salchik B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
big, O
but O
when O
people O
are O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
quite O
normal. O

There O
is O
no O
separate O
zones B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
smokers I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
non-smokers. I-TARGET

In O
general, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
inexpensive O
but O
interesting. O

I O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
menu B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Hohlak, I-TARGET
themed B-TARGET
clothes I-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
/ O
music. B-TARGET

A O
girl O
from O
our O
modest O
company O
got O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
glass O
of O
wine B-TARGET
(enjoyed O
it O
very O
much, O
we O
ordered O
some O
more). O

Service B-TARGET
in O
general O
is O
fast O
and O
of O
high O
quality. O

We O
didn't O
order O
a O
lot O
but O
from O
what O
we O
ordered O
everything O
was O
good, O
fresh, O
high O
quality. O

Plus O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
quite O
understandable O
(I O
would O
say O
a O
little O
bit O
homemade, O
without O
all O
those O
fancy O
gourmet O
stuff). O

Prices O
in O
this O
institution O
affordable: O
a O
pot O
of O
sausage O
200 O
p., O
80 O
p./800r. O
Gorilka O
Nemirov, O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
(I O
do O
not O
remember O
which O
one) O
-150 O
p., O
cigarettes O
and O
a O
lighter O
Kent O
100 O
p., O
beer B-TARGET
(some O
on O
tap O
Kholya, O
however O
tasty) O
150 O
p. O
(bottled O
at O
130), O
the O
total O
bill O
with O
alcohol O
for O
three O
came O
out O
1470 O
p. O
+ O
tea. O

Regretfully, O
I O
come O
to O
this O
area O
very O
rarely, O
so O
the O
next O
time O
will O
not O
get O
to O
visit O
soon, O
but O
periodically O
I O
think O
to O
visit O
this O
place. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
on O
April O
29 O
in O
Amulet. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
pleased O
us O
and O
our O
guests O
very O
much. O

Everything O
was O
great, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
we O
took O
1500 O
per O
person, O
there O
was O
enough O
food O
for O
everyone, O
all O
the O
rest O
was O
packed. O

We O
liked O
a O
hot O
snack O
- O
chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
tempura, I-TARGET
and O
of O
the O
main O
course O
we O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
veal B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushroom I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
- O
very O
tender O
and O
tasty! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
wonderful, O
nice O
girls B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
helped O
us O
after O
the O
party O
not O
only O
to O
pack O
the O
food O
but O
also O
all O
the O
flowers O
that O
we O
were O
given! O

The O
new O
room B-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful O
- O
light, O
lots O
of O
room, O
and O
the O
chandeliers B-TARGET
are O
gorgeous! O

We O
thank O
the O
manager B-TARGET
Liliana O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
restaurant. O
It O
was O
a O
great O
place! O
We O
will O
recommend O
it O
to O
our O
friends O
next O
time! O

Khmelkovs O

I O
had O
lunch O
at O
Amici O
several O
times. O

And O
every O
time O
I O
left O
satisfied). O

Hard O
to O
call O
it O
a O
restaurant, O
but O
the O
category O
of O
cafe, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
the O
institution O
excels O
- O
rather O
a O
cozy O
little O
corner O
of O
the O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine! I-TARGET

Warm O
light O
colors, B-TARGET
cozy O
sofas, B-TARGET
noble O
old O
chairs B-TARGET
create O
a O
cozy, O
nice O
layout, B-TARGET
nice O
utensils B-TARGET
- O
I O
liked O
it O
all. O

Decent O
service. B-TARGET

But O
of O
course O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
a O
major O
plus. O

I've O
been O
for O
a O
business O
lunch O
a O
few O
times O
- O
salad, O
soup, O
main O
course, O
a O
drink, O
and O
there O
were O
a O
few O
variants O
for O
every O
item. B-TARGET

I O
would O
especially O
like O
to O
mention O
the O
help O
of O
waiter B-TARGET
in O
choosing O
for O
me O
and O
replacing O
some O
dishes O
with O
vegetarian O
ones O
(I O
don't O
eat O
meat). O

I O
tried O
pasta B-TARGET
which O
you O
can O
taste O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
places O
but O
here O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
ever O
tasted! O

In O
my O
neighbourhood, O
it's O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
to O
eat! O

I O
spent O
my O
birthday O
on O
27.11 O
at O
the O
restaurant O
Saltan O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
in O
the O
hall O
with O
aquariums O
and O
live O
music. O

I O
and O
all O
my O
guests, O
and O
they O
were O
11 O
people, O
unanimously O
liked O
the O
institution. B-TARGET

Thanks O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
waiters B-TARGET
and O
manager B-TARGET
clever O
girls O
do O
their O
job O
to O
the O
best O
of O
their O
ability. O

Very O
tasty O
food, B-TARGET
warm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
great O
music, B-TARGET
show B-TARGET
program. I-TARGET

Belly B-TARGET
dancing I-TARGET
in O
a O
very O
good O
performance. O

Our O
company O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
again O
and O
again O
to O
celebrate O
holidays O
or O
just O
have O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
will O
recommend O
it B-TARGET
to O
our O
friends. O

Regards, O
Natalia. O

I O
want O
to O
share O
my O
impressions O
about O
this O
newly O
opened O
restaurant O
on O
my O
favorite O
restaurant O
street O
Rubinshteina. O

Visited O
it O
twice O
in O
the O
afternoon O
for O
business O
lunch. O

So, O
the O
first O
visit O
- O
at O
the O
entrance O
I O
was O
courteously O
met O
and O
quickly O
served O
and O
the O
only O
two O
questions O
about O
the O
food O
were O
about O
the O
overly O
salty O
spinach B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
and O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
bread B-TARGET
plate. I-TARGET

And O
the O
second O
time, O
when O
during O
a O
business O
lunch O
I O
had O
a O
business O
meeting, O
I O
was O
unexpectedly O
disappointed. O

And O
here O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
as O
expected. O

I O
ordered O
a O
glass O
of O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
as O
an O
aperitif, O
got O
it O
warm O
and O
uncooled O
and O
my O
glass O
was O
taken O
away O
into O
the O
refrigerator O
... O
Someone O
was O
drinking, O
and O
I O
was O
waiting O
for O
my O
glass, O
asked O
for O
a O
business O
lunch O
plate, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
said O
that O
we O
will O
give O
brusketas O
as O
a O
bonus O
when O
ordering O
wine O
and O
we O
started O
to O
wait O
... O
but O
by O
that O
time O
the O
ordered O
borscht B-TARGET
had O
already O
cooled, O
which O
incidentally O
was O
tasteless. O

But O
the O
hot B-TARGET
meal O
and O
dessert B-TARGET
/ O
we O
ordered O
panacotta B-TARGET
/ O
were O
delicious, O
and O
the O
bruschettas B-TARGET
were O
good O
too. O

And O
all O
was O
polite O
and O
attentive. O

So O
not O
all O
unequivocally O
bad, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
for O
such O
a O
restaurant. B-TARGET

But O
God O
is O
a O
threesome, O
I O
will O
visit O
again O
and O
maybe O
there O
will O
be O
something O
to O
praise. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
birthday O
on O
April O
5 O
at O
Peter O
restaurant. O

From O
the O
first O
minute O
we O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
staff B-TARGET
- O
very O
friendly O
waiters, B-TARGET
bartenders B-TARGET
and O
especially O
we O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Helena! O

We O
were O
immediately O
offered O
tea O
or O
coffee O
(at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
institution) B-TARGET
that O
not O
all O
restaurants B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
city O
offer! O

Guests O
at O
the O
event O
was O
about O
30 O
people, O
Elena O
has O
very O
affordably O
explained O
us O
that O
is O
included O
in O
the O
banquet O
menu, O
which O
is O
worth O
to O
put O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
what O
you O
can O
refuse. O

Also O
helped O
calculate O
how O
much O
and O
what O
kind O
of O
alcohol O
we O
need O
to O
buy O
at O
our O
event! O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
banquet O
from O
the O
first O
second O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
felt O
the O
mood O
of O
a O
holiday, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
smiled O
and O
congratulated! O
It O
was O
very O
nice! O
The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
unparalleled, O
all O
guests O
were O
stuffed O
"to O
the O
brim" B-TARGET
all O
was O
very O
tasty! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
feast O
of O
the O
soul O
and O
the O
stomach!) O

I O
advise O
everyone O
who O
has O
not O
been O
there, O
MUST O
visit, O
and O
those O
who O
have O
been, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
worth O
doing O
it O
again!) O

I O
have O
become O
a O
regular O
visitor O
myself.... O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
get O
to O
the O
center, O
I O
always O
come O
in O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee... O

I O
recommend O
it!!! O

Had O
a O
birthday O
party O
with O
my O
friends. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
we've O
been O
here. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
really O
great! O

Stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
polite O
fast O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
food. B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
really O
wonderful! O

Everything O
is O
delicious, O
well O
prepared O
and O
well O
served. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
comfortable. O

Would O
like O
to O
say O
thank O
you O
and O
would O
recommend O
to O
anyone! O

Many O
thanks O
to O
you O
girls. O

I O
visited O
Malevich O
with O
my O
friends. O

Rumors O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
and O
bad, O
we O
decided O
to O
check O
it O
out. O

Immediately O
strikes O
the O
eye, O
the O
entrance, B-TARGET
all O
is O
beautiful, O
it O
already O
rejoice. O

Inside, O
the O
design, B-TARGET
"worn O
to O
bits," O
waiters B-TARGET
in O
the O
hall O
at O
all O
was O
not, O
the O
bartender O
was O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
reading O
a O
book, O
apparently O
customers O
come O
here O
only O
on O
weekends. O

The O
ashtray B-TARGET
was O
almost O
full O
for O
some O
reason. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
clearly, O
could O
not O
explain O
what O
is O
on O
the O
menu, O
therefore O
we O
ordered O
the O
usual O
things O
that O
we O
already O
know. O

In O
general, O
the O
service O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

In O
general, O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

The O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
but O
judging O
by O
the O
prices O
it O
should O
be O
better. O

Cocktails O
a O
lot, O
but O
expensive O
enough O
for O
a O
new O
place, O
"Daiquiri O
290r", O
usually O
new O
institutions O
tend O
to O
keep O
not O
high O
prices O
for O
a O
while, O
and O
here O
at O
once O
and O
expensive. O

In O
general O
to O
sum O
up, O
service B-TARGET
on O
3-, O
kitchen B-TARGET
on O
4, O
even O
rather O
4-, O
design B-TARGET
on O
4, O
all O
beautiful, O
but O
banal, O
lacking O
some O
zest. O

Maybe O
it B-TARGET
will O
get O
better O
or O
worse, O
still O
not O
clear. O

I O
saw O
this O
restaurant O
on O
Restoklab O
by O
chance O
and O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch O
with O
a O
friend. O

The O
choice O
is O
very O
good, O
with O
a O
fairly O
low O
price O
(like O
330 O
rubles O
including O
drinks). O

So O
I O
chose O
a O
salad O
with O
red O
fish O
and O
vegetables O
with O
mayonnaise O
(the O
fish B-TARGET
in O
the O
salad O
was O
very O
tasty, O
the O
portion B-TARGET
was O
not O
big), O
mushroom O
cream O
soup O
with O
croutons O
(the O
soup B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
only O
negative O
thing O
was O
that O
I O
would O
serve O
the O
croutons B-TARGET
separately, O
I O
don't O
like O
it O
when O
they O
become O
soft O
and O
I O
would O
add O
less O
salt) B-TARGET
Baked O
pork O
with O
mushrooms O
and O
potatoes O
(the O
pork B-TARGET
was O
juicy, O
country-style O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
dry, O
I O
would O
have O
added O
some O
sauce O
to O
this O
dish.) O

A O
friend O
agreed O
with O
me O
on O
everything O
except O
the O
hot O
dish. O

She O
chose O
grilled O
chicken O
breasts O
and O
string O
beans O
in O
tomato O
sauce O
(the O
breasts B-TARGET
were O
dry O
and O
the O
side B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
satisfying). O

Service B-TARGET
is O
fine, O
unobtrusive. O

There O
is O
a O
pleasant O
man B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance, O
polite O
and O
courteous. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
average, O
in O
principle, O
for O
lunch O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
place, B-TARGET
but O
no O
more. O

I O
can O
write O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
forever, O
I O
want O
to O
visit O
it O
again O
and O
again, O
and O
it O
doesn't O
matter O
when, O
with O
whom O
and O
on O
what O
occasion. O

WinterSummer O
is O
like O
a O
magnet O
for O
me. O

In O
the O
daytime O
it O
is O
a O
pleasant O
lunch, B-TARGET
in O
the O
evening O
- O
delicious O
dinners, O
flowing O
smoothly O
into O
a O
night O
party, O
karaoke O
and O
dancing. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
but O
it's O
time O
to O
make O
repairs, O
I O
think O
most O
visitors O
would O
be O
for O
this O
idea, O
although O
the O
old O
interior, B-TARGET
a O
little O
shabby O
furniture B-TARGET
does O
not O
prevent O
come O
here O
again O
and O
again, O
because O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
the O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

Cuisine B-TARGET
in O
ZimaLeto O
is O
very O
good: O
good O
and O
tasty O
grill B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
(especially O
fish), B-TARGET
a O
standard O
selection O
of O
salads, B-TARGET
large O
selection O
of O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
(the O
most O
delicious O
Geisha B-TARGET
and O
baked O
Kyoto), B-TARGET
decent O
cocktail B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
but O
the O
long, B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
and O
strawberry B-TARGET
margaritas I-TARGET
do O
not O
recommend O
anyone, O
disgusting! O

But O
not O
everything O
has O
to O
be O
perfect! O

I O
smoke O
hookah B-TARGET
only O
here, O
I O
think O
it's O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city. O

The O
only O
minus O
of O
this O
place O
is O
service: B-TARGET
girls B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
hostesses I-TARGET
with O
an O
absent O
look, O
imagine O
themselves O
as O
hostesses O
of O
an O
institution, O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
there O
is O
not O
much O
to O
do. O

On O
weekends, O
especially O
late O
at O
night, O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
order, O
you O
won't O
get O
the O
bill, O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
some O
of O
the O
change O
you O
can O
stay O
there O
till O
morning. O

I O
still O
thank O
my O
friend O
for O
discovering O
this O
place B-TARGET
a O
year O
ago. O

Since O
then, O
every O
trip O
to O
The O
Wave B-TARGET
has O
put O
me O
in O
a O
great O
mood. O

Before O
I O
get O
to O
the O
most O
important O
thing, O
the O
cuisine, O
let O
me O
say O
a O
few O
words O
about O
the O
interior, O
service O
and O
in O
general O
about O
the O
restaurant. O

There O
is O
always O
a O
pleasant O
and O
welcoming O
atmosphere: B-TARGET
friendly O
hostesses, B-TARGET
helpful O
waiters B-TARGET
(but O
sometimes O
not O
so O
much), O
soft O
leather O
sofas B-TARGET
and O
paintings O
of O
contemporary O
artists O
for O
sale. O

The O
Wave B-TARGET
is O
a O
place O
where, O
on O
a O
weekday, O
it's O
very O
easy O
to O
hide O
from O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
of O
the O
city. O

But O
all O
this O
would O
be O
unimportant O
if O
not O
for O
the O
amazing O
food B-TARGET
. O

The O
Caesars B-TARGET
are O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had, O
and O
the O
Greek B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
really O
surprised O
me, O
I O
did O
not O
think O
that O
such O
a O
"familiar" O
dish O
could O
be O
made O
so O
delicious. O

The O
fettuccini B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
porcini I-TARGET
melt O
in O
the O
mouth, O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crabs I-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
I O
would O
add O
a O
little O
more O
sauce O
to O
make O
the O
taste O
softer. O

Sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls...that's B-TARGET
a O
separate O
topic, O
to O
me O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city, O
no O
Ginza O
can O
compare. O

And O
tasty O
absolutely O
all O
of O
them, O
my O
favorites O
are O
Kyoto B-TARGET
roll, I-TARGET
spicy B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
roll. I-TARGET

As O
for O
desserts O
I O
take O
them O
more O
than O
calmly O
but O
Napoleon B-TARGET
cake O
and O
cheesecake B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
Philadelphia, I-TARGET
fruit B-TARGET
tartar I-TARGET
changed O
my O
attitude O
towards O
desserts O
in O
a O
positive O
way. O

We O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
our O
wedding O
anniversary O
with O
my O
wife O
at O
Shabu-Shabu. O

When O
we O
arrived, O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
visitors, O
and O
we O
were O
seated O
in O
a O
small O
room. O

It O
was O
quiet O
and O
peaceful O
until O
a O
company O
of O
4 O
came O
in. O

It O
seemed O
like O
they O
sat O
down O
at O
our O
table, O
so O
little O
space O
there. O

This O
room O
should O
have O
had O
two O
tables O
instead O
of O
four. O

We O
really O
liked O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
in O
this O
place. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
made O
with O
the O
freshest O
ingredients. B-TARGET

The O
eel B-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
impressed O
us O
the O
most. O
We O
will O
try O
other O
dishes O
next O
time. O

And O
we O
also O
ordered O
our O
Shabu-Shabu O
(Japanese O
fondue). O

The O
most O
delicious O
ingredient B-TARGET
- O
marble B-TARGET
meat, I-TARGET
just O
finger-licking. O

The O
broth B-TARGET
was O
just O
a O
little O
too O
salty. O

I O
still O
have O
very O
good O
impressions O
and O
we O
will O
visit O
again. O

After O
visiting O
the O
cinema O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch O
with O
my O
husband O
and O
friends O
at O
the O
restaurant O
"Lounge". O

We O
ordered O
Gazpacho O
and O
Solyanka O
with O
my O
husband. O
Our O
main O
course O
was O
Chicken O
Tabak O
with O
grilled O
vegetables O
and O
Sudak O
baked O
with O
cheese O
sauce. O

The O
Gazpacho B-TARGET
was O
too O
spicy, O
although O
I O
asked O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
to O
make O
this O
dish O
not O
spicy. O

The B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
was O
tasty, O
but O
as O
for O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
vegetables, I-TARGET
they O
were O
not O
grilled O
at O
all, O
but O
roasted B-TARGET
eggplant, I-TARGET
zucchini I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
bell I-TARGET
peppers I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
oil, O
and O
were O
awfully O
tasteless. O

My O
husband O
did O
not O
like O
it O
either, O
the O
dish B-TARGET
seemed O
rather O
greasy. O

My O
friends O
ordered O
lamb O
shashlik B-TARGET
but O
it O
didn't O
look O
like O
shashlik O
(cooked O
on O
the O
grill). O

Also O
ordered O
a O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
on O
tap O
and O
regretted O
it, O
after O
that O
even O
a O
headache O
(except O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
drunk O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
no O
alcohol O
was O
consumed O
that O
day). O

We O
ordered O
a O
bread O
basket O
for O
4 O
people O
with O
different O
kinds O
of O
bread, O
almost O
all O
bread B-TARGET
was O
warm, O
soft O
and O
tasty, O
but O
the O
pieces O
of O
white B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
had O
a O
strong O
musty B-TARGET
taste I-TARGET
((. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
nice, O
pretty O
cozy, O
service B-TARGET
is O
average. O

The O
food B-TARGET
at O
this O
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
tasty O
as O
we O
didn't O
like O
it O
at O
all. O

The O
food B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
not O
very O
tasty! O

I O
went O
to O
your O
place O
three O
times O
(all O
three O
of O
them O
on O
Pionerskaya O
street), O
and O
all O
three O
times O
I O
stood O
at O
the O
door O
for O
about O
ten O
minutes O
waiting O
for O
them O
to O
notice O
me O
and O
another O
ten O
minutes O
waiting O
for O
them O
to O
bring O
me O
the O
menu... O

And O
how O
long O
I O
waited O
to O
get O
my O
order O
taken... O
I O
am O
silent!!! O

And O
I O
would O
have O
understood O
it, O
if O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
in O
addition O
to O
me O
sat O
only O
3 O
tables... O

ALL O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
with O
faces O
like O
they O
just O
want O
to O
destroy O
me... O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice, O
very O
comfortable O
and O
cozy O
sofas, B-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
your O
wonderful O
offer, O
which O
to O
my O
pleasant O
surprise, O
applies O
to O
the O
entire O
menu, O
not O
just O
on O
the O
sushi/rolls!!! O

If O
you O
work O
with O
the O
staff O
you O
will O
have O
a O
great O
place...!!! O

Looking O
forward O
to O
the O
changes O
to O
come O
to O
you O
again! O

Our O
family O
loves O
coming O
to O
this O
cafe. B-TARGET

We O
are O
thrilled O
with O
the O
food, B-TARGET
kids B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
high B-TARGET
chairs I-TARGET
for O
kids. O

All O
very O
tasty O
and O
interesting. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
comfortable O
and O
relaxing. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
service. B-TARGET

But O
we O
always O
book O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
serve O
professionally, O
but O
without O
being O
overly O
cheerful. O

You O
have O
an O
impression O
that O
they O
don't O
serve O
you O
but O
take O
care O
of O
you. O

They O
will O
tell O
you O
about O
any O
dish O
and O
advise O
you O
the O
best O
way O
to O
serve O
it. O

Any O
surplus O
from O
the O
table O
is O
removed O
not O
only O
by O
your O
waiter, B-TARGET
but O
also O
by O
any O
other O
waiter. O

And O
if O
you O
are O
having O
tea O
with O
cake O
in O
company, O
then O
several O
waiters B-TARGET
will O
try O
to O
bring O
everything O
at O
once. O

It's O
very O
convenient O
and O
nice O
to O
drink O
tea O
all O
together, O
not O
waiting O
until O
someone O
else O
brings O
the O
dessert. O

And O
no O
one O
will O
look O
at O
you O
waiting O
for O
you O
to O
leave O
soon O
after O
you've O
eaten O
everything. O

All O
for O
the O
full O
pleasure O
and O
enjoyment. O

We O
visit O
the O
cafe O
once O
a O
week O
with O
the O
whole O
family O
just O
to O
enjoy O
the O
delicious O
and O
varied O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

I O
will O
not O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
anyone, O
as O
we O
are O
too O
crowded! O

On O
Saturday O
night O
there O
are O
almost O
no O
seats O
in O
the O
non-smoking O
area. O

In O
September O
we O
had O
a O
wedding O
in O
"Dubrovskoe"... O

Whenever O
we O
met O
the O
host O
he O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
overjoyed O
and O
assured O
us O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
fine! O

Everything O
had O
been O
arranged O
in O
advance, O
but O
we O
decided O
an O
hour O
before O
the O
banquet O
to O
send O
two O
guests O
to O
the O
cafe O
to O
supervise O
the O
preparations, O
and O
we O
warned O
the O
host O
about O
that! O

When O
our O
friends O
arrived, O
the B-TARGET
host I-TARGET
expressed O
surprise..... O

The O
cafe O
was O
not O
closed O
for O
the O
time O
of O
preparations, O
the O
last O
guest O
left O
5 O
minutes O
before O
our O
arrival.... O

The O
staff, B-TARGET
to O
put O
it O
mildly, O
not O
enough O
and O
the O
owner O
offered O
our O
friends O
themselves O
to O
wash O
the O
fruit, O
set O
the O
table O
etc.. O

It O
was O
about O
halfway O
through O
the O
banquet O
that O
the O
host O
said O
he O
was O
feeling O
unwell O
and O
was O
going O
home O
(I O
should O
add O
that O
he O
was O
actively O
involved O
in O
the O
service)... O

We O
were O
left O
with O
1 O
(!) O
waiter B-TARGET
who, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
small O
number O
of O
guests, O
was O
not O
able O
to O
cope... O

We B-TARGET
literally I-TARGET
had I-TARGET
to O
clear O
the O
dishes O
ourselves. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
half O
an O
hour O
for O
the O
cake... O

We O
were O
asked O
several O
times O
to O
bring O
it O
out, O
and O
then O
we O
waited O
for O
cups, O
tea, O
etc. O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
looked O
like O
just O
a O
boy O
from O
the O
street, O
who O
does O
not O
understand O
what O
we O
want O
from O
him O
... O

In O
general, O
everything O
was O
deliciously O
prepared O
and O
served O
well O
too, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
attitude O
have O
shocked O
and O
spoilt O
the O
overall O
impression O
of O
the O
holiday... O

We O
visited O
this O
place O
in O
the O
daytime. O

It O
was O
not O
lunch O
or O
dinner, O
but O
there O
were O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
really O
nice, O
but O
the O
view B-TARGET
is O
forgiving, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
in O
the O
Vyborg O
side O
of O
our O
native O
city. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
at O
a O
good O
level. O

Good O
quality O
and O
fast O
service, B-TARGET
although O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
forgot O
to O
bring O
one O
dish. O

The O
guests O
liked O
everything O
they O
ordered, O
including O
salads B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crabs, I-TARGET
pasta B-TARGET
(fettuccini), I-TARGET
risotto, B-TARGET
and O
seabass B-TARGET
fish. O

Desserts O
chose O
all O
from O
the O
menu, O
except O
for O
the O
pie O
of O
the O
day. O

Tried O
each O
other. O

Enjoyed O
it O
very O
much. O

Restaurant B-TARGET
"Povari" I-TARGET
slowly O
but O
surely O
begins O
to O
turn O
from O
a O
decent O
place O
into O
an O
ordinary O
diner. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
used O
to O
come O
to O
Povary's O
several O
times O
a O
week O
for O
lunch O
and O
were O
their O
regulars. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
last O
1.5 O
- O
2 O
months O
after O
visiting O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
there O
are O
only O
unpleasant O
impressions: O
waiters B-TARGET
- O
not O
at O
all O
"at O
the O
level", O
administrators B-TARGET
- O
to O
match O
them... O

Today O
after O
a O
few O
"screw-ups" O
the B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
politely O
asked O
to O
invite O
the O
administrator. O

After O
20 O
minutes O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
came O
and O
said: O
"I'm O
sorry, O
but O
the O
receptionist B-TARGET
is O
so O
busy O
right O
now O
that O
she O
can't O
come O
to O
you. O

You O
can O
come O
back O
after O
4pm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" O
How O
about O
that???????? O

There O
are O
just O
no O
words! O

In O
general, O
anyone O
who O
knows O
a O
lot O
about O
decent O
restaurants, O
DO O
NOT O
RECOMMEND O
TO O
"POVARI". B-TARGET

We O
were O
there O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
fine, O
and O
I O
loved O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

The O
menu O
is O
Italian, O
the O
music O
is O
French... O
The O
food B-TARGET
was O
ok. O

Some O
of O
the O
fish B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
are O
not O
very O
fresh, O
so O
they O
overcook O
it O
until O
it's O
rubbery. O

Some O
of O
the O
fish B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
is O
not O
there, O
they O
explain O
that O
it O
was O
Friday O
and O
they O
ate O
it O
all O
-..... O

Although O
we O
were O
on O
Saturday O
night O
and O
were O
the O
only O
customers. O

And B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
rest I-TARGET
of O
the O
menu O
was O
ok. O

Really O
enjoyed O
the O
desserts. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
was O
good. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
very O
nice. O

I O
would O
go O
again... O

I O
wish O
there O
were O
more O
people... O

One O
of O
my O
favourite O
places! B-TARGET

Spent O
most O
of O
the O
summer O
there! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
hang O
out O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
beer B-TARGET
with O
croutons O
or O
calamari O
rings, O
you're O
welcome O
to O
come! O

The O
interior O
is O
very O
cozy, O
we O
sat O
everywhere O
we O
could, O
one O
downside O
in O
the O
summer O
is O
that O
they O
sometimes O
get O
stiff O
and O
forget O
about O
the O
people O
"upstairs". O

And O
inside O
I O
like O
to O
sit O
both O
at O
the O
table O
and O
at O
the O
counter. O

Bartenders O
and O
waiters B-TARGET
work O
momentarily, O
after O
ordering O
a O
maximum O
of O
a O
minute O
passes O
and O
the O
beer O
in O
front O
of O
you O
with O
appetizers O
in O
different O
ways, O
well O
here's O
what O
I O
can O
say O
that O
has O
always O
been O
delicious. O

I O
advise O
to O
take O
an O
assortment O
of B-TARGET
appetizers I-TARGET
to O
beer O
(there O
are O
cheese O
sticks O
and O
calamari O
rings, O
potatoes O
and O
sausage) O
in O
sufficient O
quantity. O

From O
the O
beer O
I O
personally O
like O
cherry B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
almonds, I-TARGET
and O
in O
principle O
I O
tried O
all O
kinds O
of O
sweet B-TARGET
beers I-TARGET
there, O
because O
I O
like O
it, O
in O
the O
summer O
there O
were O
about O
5-6 O
varieties. O

This O
weekend O
they O
said O
they O
only O
have O
cherry. O

The O
guys O
there O
are O
having O
a O
blast O
too O
and O
they O
say O
the O
beers B-TARGET
are O
great, O
especially O
the O
Guinness. B-TARGET

We O
like O
it O
there O
and O
we O
like O
our O
friends O
there. O

Sometimes O
you O
can O
ask O
for O
louder O
music O
when O
some O
famous O
hit O
is O
playing. O
:) O

In O
general, O
we O
feel O
like O
we O
are O
at O
home O
there! O

Good O
day! O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
we O
celebrated O
my O
husband's O
birthday O
on O
September O
09, O
2010. O

Before O
that O
day O
we O
visited O
Pizza O
Hut O
at O
Moskovsky O
prospect O
224 O
last O
time O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
were O
satisfied, O
so O
we O
came O
again O
because O
of O
old O
memory, O
but O
...... O
We O
were O
waiting O
for O
15 O
min. O
until O
the O
waiter O
came. O
Hooray, O
the O
waiter O
came, O
we O
ordered O
croutons, O
beer, O
caesar O
salad O
and O
pizza. O

The O
croutons O
were O
served O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
dropped O
them O
on O
the O
floor O
before O
reaching O
our O
table..... O
. O
Then O
the O
wait O
for O
the O
croutons O
again O
and O
they O
brought O
them O
with O
warm O
beer, B-TARGET
then O
brought O
Caesar O
salad, O
I O
think O
we O
all O
know O
how O
he O
looks O
like, O
it O
turns O
out O
not. O

The O
Caesar O
salad O
consisted O
of O
the O
following O
components: O
the O
bottom O
was O
a O
large O
4 O
pieces O
(exactly O
pieces) O
cut O
from O
the O
baguette, O
lettuce O
on O
top, O
then O
some O
tomato O
and O
4 O
exactly O
large O
strips O
of O
chicken, O
Parmesan B-TARGET
was O
not O
at O
all, O
cool? O

Then O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
came O
- O
it O
must O
have O
been O
made O
of O
rubber. O

The O
cost O
of O
all O
this O
"pleasure" O
is O
not O
cheap, O
service..... O
Yes, O
I O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
there O
was O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
but O
the O
musician B-TARGET
blatantly O
falsified. O

It O
is O
getting O
frightening O
that O
there O
are O
less O
and O
less O
decent O
restaurants O
in O
St. O
Petersburg. O

We O
will O
never O
come O
back O
to O
this O
place. B-TARGET

I O
came O
to O
the O
cafe O
by O
chance O
when O
we O
went O
round O
other O
places O
but O
I O
couldn't O
find O
any O
good O
ones! O

The O
cafe O
interior B-TARGET
liked O
it O
very O
much O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
stay O
so O
to O
speak O
"without O
looking O
at O
the O
menu". O

We O
came O
the O
next O
day O
with O
friends O
who O
were O
also O
delighted! O

The O
pluses O
of O
the O
cafe O
I O
would O
like O
to O
attribute O
the O
following: O
1) O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
2) O
reasonable O
prices O
3) O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET

It O
had O
a O
small B-TARGET
table O
in O
the O
yard, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
stressful O
for O
me O
personally! O

I O
had O
a O
meeting O
with O
a O
friend O
in O
the O
pub. O

It O
was O
on O
Thursday O
in O
the O
afternoon. O

At O
first O
there O
were O
not O
many O
people O
in O
the O
pub, O
but O
as O
the O
time O
was O
getting O
closer O
to O
the O
evening, O
the O
bar O
got O
more O
and O
more O
crowded. O

There O
was O
no O
smokiness O
in O
the O
room, O
good O
and O
well-thought-out O
ventilation B-TARGET
system. O

Nice O
and O
cozy O
enough O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
pub O
style. O

Very O
good O
menu, B-TARGET
but O
all O
quite O
hearty O
and O
tasty. O

And O
large O
portions, B-TARGET
which O
can O
not O
fail O
to O
please O
men. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
has O
been O
here O
more O
often O
than O
me, O
she O
says O
that O
she O
has O
tried O
almost O
everything O
and O
likes O
it. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
quick O
to O
serve O
us O
and O
to O
my O
jokey O
comment O
about O
something O
light O
and O
low-calorie O
she O
reacted O
very O
quickly O
and O
offered O
us O
a O
few O
options, O
though O
I O
wasn't O
going O
to O
keep O
a O
strict O
diet O
or O
any O
food O
restrictions. O

And O
in O
general O
she O
answered O
all O
my O
questions O
immediately O
and O
exhaustively, O
which O
was O
very O
nice. O

Maybe O
not O
always O
responsive O
to O
our O
requests, O
but O
she O
did O
her O
job O
well. O

A O
small O
flaw O
- O
on O
this O
day O
was O
a O
very O
small O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beer. I-TARGET

But O
since O
I O
was O
driving, O
I O
did O
not O
care, O
and O
my O
friend O
was O
helped O
to O
make O
the O
right O
choice O
and O
she O
was O
satisfied. O

Bottom O
line: O
I O
liked O
the O
pub. B-TARGET

If O
there O
will O
be O
any O
meetings O
in O
the O
area O
or O
just O
want O
to O
eat, O
I O
will O
definitely O
go O
there O
again. O

Happy O
to O
leave O
a O
new O
review O
on O
Puri! B-TARGET

Since O
my O
first O
visit O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
restaurant O
many O
times. O
At O
first O
it O
was O
due O
to O
purely O
objective O
circumstances O
- O
convenient O
location O
to O
the O
house, O
but O
with O
each O
time O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
left O
better O
and O
better O
impressions. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive, O
even O
with O
an O
absolute O
load O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
is O
always O
in O
sight, O
always O
able O
to O
tell O
what O
a O
particular O
dish O
is, O
all O
brought O
out O
/ O
cleaned O
in O
time. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
a O
special O
thanks O
to O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
- O
I O
think O
his O
name O
was O
Ilya O
- O
well O
done! O

Food B-TARGET
was O
satisfactory O
each O
time O
- O
salads B-TARGET
are O
always O
fresh O
vegetables, O
insanely O
delicious O
khachapuri, B-TARGET
very O
good O
lagman. B-TARGET

Decent O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
- O
no O
"so-so" O
wines. B-TARGET

They O
have O
been O
bringing O
Ayran O
as O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time O
- O
those O
who O
like O
this O
drink O
will O
appreciate O
it. O

In O
general, O
well O
done O
- O
long O
ago O
and O
5 O
+ O
corrected O
the O
deficiencies O
of O
the O
opening O
period. O

And O
now O
I O
can O
definitely O
say O
that O
this O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
the O
SW O
edge O
of O
our O
city. O

I O
will O
continue O
to O
come O
to O
you O
for O
lunches O
and O
dinners. O

By O
the O
way, O
the O
parking B-TARGET
has O
gotten O
better. O

Been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
recently O
with O
my O
wife, O
liked O
the O
service, B-TARGET
but O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
could O
be O
a O
little O
faster. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
was O
pleasant O
without O
any O
frills, O
in O
a O
strict O
style. O

We O
ordered O
kebabs, O
Caesar O
salad O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
amazing O
and O
everything O
was O
fast, O
and O
most O
importantly O
delicious. O

I O
often O
go O
to O
restaurants O
and O
order O
mostly O
shashlik O
(if O
any) O
and O
Caesar O
salad, O
and O
I O
have O
what O
to O
compare O
it O
with. O
I O
will O
say O
that O
the O
salad B-TARGET
is O
worth O
the O
money, O
and O
shashliks O
too, O
but O
the O
bar B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
bit O
expensive. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
they O
were O
carrying O
the O
bill O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
waiters B-TARGET
probably O
thought O
that O
we O
will O
sit O
and O
order O
something O
else, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
bother O
us O
much O
as O
we O
wanted O
romance O
near O
the O
Gulf O
of O
Finland. O

Honestly, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
romantic O
and, O
most O
importantly, O
delicious O
meal, O
this O
is O
the O
place. B-TARGET

Telling O
the O
truth O
now O
is O
not O
the O
season O
and O
on O
the O
street O
we O
were O
not O
to O
sit O
(cold) O
and O
it O
is O
a O
pity. O

I O
hope O
next O
summer, O
we O
will O
definitely O
go O
there O
and O
sit O
with O
his O
wife O
in O
a O
romantic O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

I O
wish O
success O
and O
prosperity O
to O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
used O
to O
go O
to O
EVRAZIA O
GOLD O
on O
Malaya O
Posadskaya O
quite O
often. O

Of O
course O
not O
for O
birthday O
parties:) O

But O
once O
I O
was O
a O
guest O
at O
a O
wedding O
(I O
almost O
never O
ate O
there, O
so O
I O
will O
talk O
about O
my O
visits O
just O
to O
"eat"). O

What O
is O
the O
attraction O
of O
GOLD? O

It O
so O
happens O
that O
during O
my O
frequent O
visits O
I O
have O
a O
good O
relationship O
with O
the O
waiters O
and O
so O
there O
have O
been O
no O
problems O
with O
the O
service... B-TARGET

Of O
food O
I O
practically O
always O
eat O
and O
drink O
the O
same O
thing: O
miso O
soup O
(well O
it's O
difficult O
to O
spoil O
it, O
it's O
almost O
the O
same O
everywhere), O
philadelphia O
- O
unlike O
other O
restaurants O
in O
the O
chain, O
roll O
is O
big O
and O
very O
tasty, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
judge, O
all O
products O
are O
fresh O
(here O
and O
there O
dried O
rice O
comes O
across O
in O
the O
drying O
boxes, O
but O
here O
it's O
ok:))))) O
My O
2 O
favorite O
dishes O
are O
Baked O
mussels O
(I O
don't O
order O
them O
that O
often O
at O
other O
places, O
but O
I O
haven't O
seen O
them O
as O
big O
and O
delicious O
as O
at O
Golda) O
and O
Minari O
(sweet O
roll O
with O
banana O
and O
chocolate, O
also O
very O
tasty). O

I O
always O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone. O

I O
don't O
know O
about O
now, O
but O
about O
2 O
months O
ago O
when O
ordering O
MOHITO O
they O
asked O
if O
it O
was O
a O
big O
one O
or O
a O
small O
one. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
Large O
is O
practically O
a O
bucket O
:))) O

A O
very O
tasty O
proper O
mojito B-TARGET
. O

I O
can't O
speak O
for O
the O
whole O
kitchen. O

But O
according O
to O
my O
subjective O
impressions O
- O
my O
4 O
favorite O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
Mojito B-TARGET
at O
Gold O
are O
the O
best O
in O
town! O

Were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
a O
day O
off. O

We O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
and O
the O
overall O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Behind O
such O
a O
stylish, O
interesting O
interior B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
varied O
menu B-TARGET
you O
can O
find O
hospitality B-TARGET
and O
respect, O
not O
a O
bit O
of O
pathos O
and O
unreasonable O
prices, O
and O
the O
quality O
matches O
the O
service. B-TARGET

On O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
day O
off O
we O
had O
a O
free O
choice O
of O
several O
tables, O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
was O
just O
wonderful, O
unobtrusive O
and O
very O
harmoniously O
chosen O
repertoire. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
made O
us O
choose O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
not O
because O
there O
wasn't O
anything O
to O
choose O
from, O
but O
because O
we O
wanted O
to O
try O
many O
things. O

We O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
food B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
- O
rabbit B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
walnut I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
salmon O
ravioli B-TARGET
and O
eggplants B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomatoes I-TARGET
- O
everything O
was O
very O
tasty. O

It's O
a O
pity O
we O
didn't O
get O
to O
the O
desserts, O
we O
were O
full:) O

It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
be O
here, O
and O
we O
hope O
to O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
in O
the O
place:) O

P.s. O
Baked B-TARGET
eggplants I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomatoes I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
- O
just O
magical!:) O

Thank O
you! O

We O
wish O
you O
to O
remain O
as O
original O
and O
original!:) O

Hi O
all! O

This O
week O
I O
visited O
Cafe O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
the O
seductive O
name O
of O
appetite) O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
immediately O
met O
by O
a O
smiling O
girl, B-TARGET
asked O
where O
we O
wanted O
to O
sit O
and O
gave O
us O
the O
menu. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
accommodating, O
comfortable O
sofas B-TARGET
and O
soft O
music.) B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
came O
straight O
away O
and O
advised O
us O
to O
try O
Sakura O
dessert O
and O
strawberry O
tea). O

I O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
and O
everything O
arrived O
really O
fast, O
which O
was O
great O
when O
ordering O
strudel) O

One O
of O
the O
best O
value O
for O
money O
places, B-TARGET
we'll O
definitely O
visit O
more O
to O
try O
dishes O
with O
original O
names) O

Breakfast O
at O
our O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
worth O
the O
price O
and O
quality O
as O
we O
had O
a O
very O
good O
review O
on O
various O
internet O
sites. O

Two O
of O
us O
had O
dinner O
with O
my O
husband. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
conducive O
to O
having O
a O
meal. O

I O
have O
a O
rather O
positive O
rather O
than O
negative O
attitude O
to O
Ikea B-TARGET
furniture))). I-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
fast O
and O
attentive. O

However, O
as O
someone O
here O
already O
wrote, O
for O
some O
reason O
all O
the O
time O
come O
up O
different O
... O
A O
strange O
approach. O

As O
for O
the O
food O
at O
first O
I O
wanted O
to O
order O
pasta, O
but O
as O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
you O
can't O
order O
half B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
portion, I-TARGET
and O
the O
whole O
portion B-TARGET
is O
500 O
g, O
which O
is O
just O
not O
realistic O
for O
me)))) O

Not O
everybody O
can O
eat O
a O
bunch B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
and O
think O
about O
fragile O
female O
customers! O

I O
had O
to O
take O
the O
soup. O

I O
chose O
the O
broccoli O
cream O
soup, O
which O
I O
really O
love. O

But O
I've O
never O
had O
worse O
soup B-TARGET
than O
this. O

I O
did O
not O
think O
that O
it O
( O
the O
soup) B-TARGET
can O
be O
so O
spoiled: O
it O
smelled O
like O
burning O
grease B-TARGET
(I O
basically O
love O
lard, O
but O
in O
my O
opinion O
lard O
has O
no O
place O
in O
the O
cream O
soup O
of O
broccoli) O
and O
not O
only O
smelled O
(((. O

I O
had O
to O
eat O
bread O
and O
butter O
and O
steal O
from O
my O
husband's O
lasagna, B-TARGET
which O
he O
ordered, O
which, O
by O
the O
way, O
was O
pretty O
decent. O

My O
husband O
was O
quite O
satisfied, O
I O
left O
not O
hungry O
either O
(the O
bread B-TARGET
was O
very O
good)))))). O

Maybe O
I O
was O
just O
unlucky, O
but O
I O
concluded O
that O
I O
will O
not O
go O
there O
again. O

I O
go O
to O
this O
place O
since O
when O
it O
was O
called O
"Sushi O
House". O

With O
the O
change O
of O
the O
name O
a O
little O
bit O
changed O
the O
menu, O
no O
other O
changes O
I O
noticed. O

Very O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
very O
quiet O
(provided O
that O
only O
one O
room), O
the O
tables O
are O
at O
a O
distance O
from O
each O
other, O
so O
if O
the O
two O
sides O
of O
you O
sit O
people O
anyway O
you O
can O
talk O
and O
eat O
quietly O
without O
listening O
to O
other O
people's O
conversations. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
nothing O
particularly O
impressive O
except O
(again!) O
Toilet. O
=) O

Food O
is O
cooked O
quickly, O
brought O
quickly O
too. O

Never O
was O
that O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
hot O
food O
for O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour. O

The O
girls B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice, O
friendly, O
will O
always O
help O
and O
advise O
you. O

From O
specific O
dishes O
I O
can O
mention O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
and O
seafood B-TARGET
salad. I-TARGET

Very O
tasty! O

I O
had O
a O
few O
birthday O
parties O
there O
with O
my O
family. O

They O
always O
bring O
us O
a O
vase O
for O
flowers O
when O
they O
see O
that O
a O
visitor O
has O
brought O
flowers. O

It's O
nice. O

Every O
time O
we O
came O
out O
stuffed O
and O
very O
happy. O

My O
favorite O
sushi B-TARGET
in O
town. O

Were O
there O
and O
will O
not O
go O
again! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
horrible! O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
rubbish, O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
listed O
on O
the O
menu. O

And O
as O
for O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
complete O
discrepancy O
to O
the O
name. O

We O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
friend's O
birthday. O

It O
began O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
were O
approached O
by O
a O
boorish O
waiter, B-TARGET
a O
trainee O
who O
does O
not O
know O
basic O
things, O
what O
the O
dish O
consists O
of... O

Then O
in O
the O
half O
empty O
restaurant O
we O
waited O
for O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
for O
our O
order. O

What O
we O
ate O
caused O
no O
pleasure, O
drinks B-TARGET
only O
more, O
than O
less, O
but O
also O
it O
did O
not O
stimulate O
to O
leave O
even O
10 O
p. O
for O
tea O
... O

We O
were O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
food! O

We O
won't O
go O
there O
again O
and O
won't O
recommend O
it O
to O
our O
friends. O

I O
had O
a O
double O
opinion O
about O
this O
place. B-TARGET

On O
the O
one O
hand, O
there O
was O
an O
interesting O
interior B-TARGET
and O
decent O
food B-TARGET
(we O
ordered O
pasta B-TARGET
and O
wine), B-TARGET
but O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
(sorry, O
I O
didn't O
remember O
his O
name) O
bored O
us O
to O
death. O

And O
the O
situation O
was O
as O
follows. O

We O
came O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
after O
lunch, O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
people O
in O
the O
room, O
so O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
came O
to O
us. O

He O
took O
our O
order O
and O
disappeared! O

We O
were O
waiting O
for O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
for O
20 O
minutes, O
and O
then O
another O
25 O
minutes O
for O
pasta... O

The O
bartender B-TARGET
looked O
at O
us O
strangely O
when O
we O
came O
to O
ask O
about O
the O
hot O
item. O

But O
it O
never O
happens, O
we O
thought, O
and O
no O
mistake, O
because O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
appeared O
and O
apologized. O

And O
then O
there O
was O
a O
show! O

He O
suddenly O
started O
coming O
up O
every O
5 O
minutes O
(while O
we O
were O
eating) O
and O
talk O
about O
the O
show O
program O
that O
will O
take O
place O
in O
the O
evening. O

After O
saying O
"We O
will O
definitely O
be O
there" O
he O
left O
and O
appeared O
again O
with O
a O
new O
portion O
of O
information. O

After O
the O
third O
approach, O
I O
could O
not O
stand O
it O
and O
asked O
"You O
have O
no O
one O
to O
talk O
to? O
And O
what O
about O
the O
bartender?" O
we O
got O
a O
completely O
sincere O
"she O
has O
a O
PMS O
today! O

Good O
thing O
we O
had O
already O
eaten O
by O
the O
time O
of O
this O
masterpiece O
answer. O

We O
asked O
for O
the O
check. O

We O
bowed O
and O
decided O
to O
change O
this O
gentleman O
no O
longer O
come:). O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
there O
periodically. O

Very O
much!!! O
like O
hot, O
crispy O
crust O
buns. B-TARGET

In O
the O
portion O
there O
are O
3 O
pieces: O
rye, O
wheat O
and O
mixed. O

They O
sometimes O
bring O
butter O
to O
them O
)))) O

By O
the O
time O
they O
bring O
snacks, O
buns B-TARGET
disappear O
from O
the O
table: O
we O
can O
not O
just O
look O
at O
them, O
they O
are O
very O
tasty. O

I've O
read O
review O
about O
khachapuri B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
I O
want O
to O
try O
it, O
I O
have O
no O
doubts O
that O
it O
will O
be O
delicious! O

I O
can O
never O
resist O
ordering O
baked B-TARGET
mussels I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
served O
on O
a O
big O
plate O
with O
a O
hill O
of O
sea O
salt. O

And O
you O
can't O
refuse O
from O
lamb B-TARGET
kebab I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
a O
bone! O

Shish B-TARGET
kebab I-TARGET
is O
extraordinary, O
as O
is O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
to O
it. O

And O
what's O
very O
nice O
- O
they O
bring O
a O
plate B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
water I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
lemon I-TARGET
to O
wash O
your O
hands O
with O
it: O
I O
like O
to O
eat O
kebab O
with O
my O
hands. O

My O
husband O
usually O
orders O
fish, B-TARGET
from O
which O
he O
is O
always O
delighted! O

This O
place O
is O
delicious!!! O

We O
recommend O
it. O

The O
interior O
will O
not O
please: O
there O
is O
an O
impression O
that O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
90's O
of O
the O
last O
century... O
But O
it O
does O
not O
prevent O
to O
spend O
good O
time O
in O
this O
place. O

The O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
windows O
will O
add O
positive O
emotions. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
does O
not O
cause O
criticism, O
but O
the O
change O
is O
not O
always O
want))) O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Wonderful O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
insanely O
delicious O
food! B-TARGET

But O
there O
is O
a O
BUT, O
a O
year O
ago O
at O
this O
restaurant O
worked O
a O
completely O
different O
staff B-TARGET
(other O
waiters, O
receptionist). O

The O
staff O
that O
was O
there O
before, O
I O
liked O
it O
much O
more! O

Waiters O
knew O
the O
menu O
from O
A O
to O
Z, O
could O
advise O
and O
tell O
you O
about O
each O
detailed O
dish, O
take O
orders O
without O
writing O
it O
down, O
remembered O
everything! O

They O
were O
insanely O
attentive, O
good-natured O
and O
friendly! O

After O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
replaced, O
I O
have O
not O
once O
confused O
dishes O
that O
I O
ordered O
and O
brought O
something O
completely O
different, O
and O
even O
forgot O
something O
at O
all. O

My O
child O
spilled O
a O
cocktail. O
We O
couldn't O
reach O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
for O
5 O
minutes O
so O
we O
wiped O
the O
cocktail O
with O
whatever O
we O
could. O

And O
I O
don't O
even O
want O
to O
say O
that O
they O
don't O
know O
anything O
about O
their O
food! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
just O
as O
delicious... O

I O
used O
to O
have O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
and O
I O
used O
to O
go O
there O
once O
a O
week O
for O
sure! O

But O
now O
I O
don't O
have O
such O
a O
great O
desire. O

If O
I O
knew O
where O
they O
moved O
the O
old O
team, O
I'd O
probably O
go O
there O
now... O

It's O
a O
great O
place. B-TARGET

I O
walked O
around O
Krestovsky O
with O
my O
girlfriend, O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
and O
have O
a O
coffee. O

My O
girlfriend O
really O
liked O
the O
tiramisu B-TARGET
(it O
was O
her O
favorite O
dessert, B-TARGET
and O
she O
said O
that O
it O
was O
really O
well O
made). O

I O
ordered O
a B-TARGET
fruit I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
which O
was O
pretty O
tasty O
even O
though O
I O
prefer O
the O
calorie-laden O
food O
:). O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
ok, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
know O
their O
job. O

I O
don't O
really O
know O
what O
to O
make O
of O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
but O
it O
seems O
that O
it O
was O
decorated O
in O
a O
French O
style. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
restaurant! B-TARGET

I O
was O
looking O
for O
an O
oriental O
and O
not O
very O
expensive O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
found O
it! O

Celebrated O
our O
wedding O
on O
May O
21, O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

Nice O
receptionist B-TARGET
Olga O
immediately O
offered O
a O
VIP-room, B-TARGET
the O
best O
part: O
there O
is O
no O
extra O
charge. O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised, O
the O
tables O
were O
not O
empty, O
all O
the O
salads B-TARGET
were O
delicious, O
we O
want O
to O
give O
special O
attention O
to O
the O
steak, B-TARGET
oh O
it's O
something! O

All O
my O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased, O
by O
the O
way O
about O
a O
steak B-TARGET
everyone O
who O
ate O
it O
remembers O
:) O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
bring O
our O
own O
alcohol, O
but O
we O
bought O
some O
with O
us O
as O
well. O

I O
liked O
it O
very, O
very O
much! O

The O
toilets B-TARGET
are O
cool, O
with O
mirrors O
and O
water O
running O
down O
the O
wall O
in O
the O
men's O
room O
(my O
husband O
said O
so). O

And O
the O
hookah B-TARGET
is O
really O
the O
best O
in O
town! O

Everyone O
here!!!! O

And O
this O
is O
not O
advertising, O
it's O
really O
very O
cozy O
and O
delicious O
and O
just O
a O
pleasure O
to O
be O
here, O
new O
interior B-TARGET
solutions. O

I O
recently O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
"MASSMIDIA" O
with O
my O
husband, O
and O
not O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

Honestly, O
after O
visiting, O
for O
some O
time O
I O
was O
in O
shock. O

Horror. O

Massmedia, B-TARGET
what O
happened O
to O
you? O

What O
happened O
to O
the O
friendly O
staff O
and O
the O
almost O
perfect O
service? O

At O
first O
it O
seemed O
like O
nothing, O
met O
and O
sat O
down, O
and O
then O
it O
all O
started, O
my O
husband O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
dish O
before O
me, O
everything O
could O
be O
nothing, O
if O
not O
for O
the O
answer O
of O
the O
waiter: B-TARGET
"Well, O
excuse O
me, O
as O
cooked" O
...... O
. O
(service B-TARGET
in O
general O
leaves O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired.) O

And O
at O
the O
end O
of O
dinner O
and O
completely O
forgot O
about O
us. O

It O
seems O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
more O
interested O
in O
talking O
to O
the O
bartender O
and O
manager O
than O
guests O
at O
their O
restaurant. O

Massmedia O
teach O
your O
staff, B-TARGET
because O
it's O
the O
key O
to O
success. O

As O
a O
result, O
the O
evening O
was O
ruined. O

If O
you O
should O
go O
there, O
then O
only O
to O
your O
favorite O
mussels, B-TARGET
and O
then O
run O
away O
from O
there O
before O
the O
insolent O
staff B-TARGET
absolutely O
discouraged O
even O
to O
run O
into O
them O
!!!!. O

Honestly, O
we O
will O
not O
come O
again, O
and O
do O
not O
advise O
others. O

And O
what O
was O
the O
beginning? O

Who O
loves O
tasty O
food, B-TARGET
come O
to O
Diana, B-TARGET
you O
will O
not O
regret O
it. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
ten O
of O
us O
and O
our O
colleagues O
celebrated O
a O
birthday O
there O
and O
we O
all O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

Since O
there O
are O
many O
birthdays O
during O
the O
year O
we O
visited O
almost O
all O
similar O
places O
around O
Sennaya O
street O
and O
we O
can O
compare O
them. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
in O
Diana O
is O
comparable O
to O
the O
First O
Liquor O
Bar O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
considerably O
lower. O

We O
asked O
for O
cocktails O
although O
they O
are O
not O
on O
the O
menu. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
also O
at O
a O
high O
level! O

Of O
minor O
drawbacks O
- O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
cook O
the O
hot O
dishes O
(this O
must O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
and O
ordered O
immediately) O
and O
the O
Mojito B-TARGET
was O
unusual O
- O
with O
a O
caramel O
and O
too O
sweet O
taste. O

Had O
a O
visit O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
some O
guests, O
celebrating O
a O
birthday. O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
poor O
and O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
get O
the O
drinks O
and O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
to O
repeat O
it O
several O
times. O

We O
ordered O
salads O
and O
main O
courses O
in O
advance O
having O
made O
an O
advance O
payment O
and O
the O
manager O
promised O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
ready O
when O
we O
arrived. O

When O
we O
arrived O
it O
was O
as O
if O
we O
had O
not O
been O
expected. O

The O
ship O
departed O
from O
the O
pier, O
and O
the O
table O
was O
not O
set. O

The O
second O
was O
served O
when O
the O
ship O
came O
back. O

We O
barely O
had O
time O
to O
finish O
the O
ordered O
dishes. O

Now O
about O
the O
cuisine O
- O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small, O
meat B-TARGET
is O
tough, O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
for O
such O
a O
meal. B-TARGET

I O
didn't O
feel O
comfortable O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guests O
and O
the O
wonderful O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window O
and O
the O
pleasant O
interior B-TARGET
smoothed O
out O
the O
bad O
service. O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
several O
times. O

I O
can O
not O
say O
that O
I'm O
a O
foodie, O
but O
I O
liked O
the O
food. B-TARGET

The O
fact O
that O
I O
do O
not O
eat O
sushi O
and O
rolls, O
but O
I O
eat O
meat, O
and O
soup O
would O
take O
except O
for O
a O
business O
lunch. O

In O
short, O
a O
must O
go O
here O
for O
those O
who O
prefer O
the O
second B-TARGET
course O
and O
salads, B-TARGET
on O
them O
the O
situation O
is O
excellent. O

Stewed B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
- O
a O
huge O
choice, O
and O
salads O
with O
vegetables, O
chicken, O
meat, O
etc. O

I.e. O
everything O
as O
I O
like. O

As O
for O
the O
interior B-TARGET
- O
yes, O
it's O
standard, O
but O
I'm O
not O
Tema O
Lebedev, O
and O
that's O
why O
megadesign O
finds O
don't O
interest O
me, O
I O
came O
here O
to O
eat, O
not O
to O
look O
at O
the O
design. O

The O
same O
goes O
for O
the O
waitresses' O
appearance. O

There O
are O
not O
many O
people O
here O
and O
that's O
great. O

Smoking B-TARGET
rooms I-TARGET
are O
separated O
and O
that's O
why O
it O
was O
not O
a O
problem. O

As O
far O
as O
service B-TARGET
is O
concerned O
- O
I O
agree O
100% O
with O
the O
opinion O
that O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
shift. O

There O
were O
those O
who O
were O
served O
at O
9, O
and O
there O
were O
those O
who O
were O
served O
at O
1 O
(these O
were O
immediately O
dealt O
with). O

As O
for O
desserts O
- O
usually O
took O
ice B-TARGET
cream, I-TARGET
it's O
certainly O
delicious, O
but O
close O
to O
home O
just O
the O
same O
weight O
sold, O
ie, O
nothing O
special. O

Restaurant O
on O
Energetikov O
Street. O

Came O
in O
with O
a O
young O
man, O
not O
a O
single O
waiter B-TARGET
looked O
at O
us! O

We O
took O
a O
seat O
at O
a O
table O
of O
our O
own O
choice. O

Waiting O
for O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
for O
ten O
minutes. O

Didn't O
wait. O

We O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
menu O
ourselves. O

Another O
15-minute O
wait... O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
over. O

It O
got O
worse. O

During O
the O
time O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
our O
order O
two O
couples O
were O
served. O

Honestly O
we O
wanted O
to O
leave, O
but O
probably O
wanted O
to O
eat O
more, O
so O
we O
stayed. O

No O
pleasure O
from O
the O
visit. O

Only O
the O
bill O
was O
brought O
quickly. O

You O
can O
only O
go O
there O
for O
the O
cheap O
specials, O
but O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
card, O
though O
I O
expect O
positive O
emotions O
from O
visiting O
such O
places B-TARGET
at O
any O
price. O

The O
pub B-TARGET
is O
great O
for O
watching O
soccer! O

A O
lot O
of O
screens, B-TARGET
conveniently O
located. O

Nice O
music. B-TARGET

This O
place O
made O
me O
think O
of O
a O
restaurant O
:) O

A O
good O
selection O
of O
delicious O
beer. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
noteworthy. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
high O
quality O
and O
tasty. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
especially, O
excuse O
me, O
in O
the O
ladies B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
really O
liked O
it O
(great O
hearing O
sports O
broadcasts, O
noted O
not O
only O
me O
:D) O

But O
the O
professionalism O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
worth O
working O
on. O

I O
ordered O
salads O
and O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
a O
long O
time O
but O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
forgot O
about O
them. O

I O
had O
to O
disturb O
the O
young O
lady B-TARGET
serving O
the O
next O
table. O

I O
wish O
Finnegans O
to O
prosper. O

I'll O
tell O
you O
a O
wonderful O
story O
about O
how O
the O
customers O
are O
valued O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Troika". I-TARGET

My O
friend O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
her O
birthday O
there. O
It O
just O
so O
happened O
that O
the O
day O
of O
celebration O
coincided O
with O
the O
eve O
of O
Easter. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
empty! O
(The O
reservation O
was O
for O
7 O
p.m.) O

But O
it O
was O
open O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
birthday O
:) O

I O
have O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
service, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
perfect! O

As O
a O
person O
who O
does O
not O
eat O
meat O
and O
poultry, O
it O
was O
difficult O
for O
me O
to O
make O
an O
order. O

That O
day O
the O
hot O
fish O
dishes O
did O
not O
attract O
my O
attention. O

I O
ordered O
a O
hot O
vegetable O
appetizer. O

Frankly O
speaking, O
I O
didn't O
like O
it O
too O
much O
in O
appearance O
(it O
is O
only O
because O
of O
the O
way O
of O
cooking, O
vegetables O
lose O
their O
brightness O
after O
heat O
treatment), O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
that O
it O
was O
amazingly O
delicious, O
considering O
that O
by O
the O
time O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
served O
I O
was O
no O
longer O
hungry. O

It O
was O
the O
second O
time O
in O
my O
life O
when O
I O
ate O
with O
such O
an O
appetite. O

The O
hostess O
of O
the O
occasion O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
attention O
from O
the O
restaurant O
and O
dessert O
from O
the O
place). O

I O
can O
not O
get O
past O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
artists. B-TARGET

Beautiful, O
professional O
(unfortunate O
that O
such O
shows O
are O
not O
to O
my O
taste, O
mostly O
with O
great O
interest O
to O
look O
at O
the O
decorations O
and O
costumes). O

Already O
decided O
to O
visit O
this O
place B-TARGET
periodically. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Troika" I-TARGET
for O
the O
excellent O
experience! O

From O
the O
whole O
family, O
I O
express O
my O
gratitude O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
for O
organizing O
my O
mother's O
birthday O
party! O

From O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
our O
communication O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
we O
could O
trust O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
organize O
such O
an O
important O
event O
for O
us. O

They O
offered O
us O
different O
menu B-TARGET
options, I-TARGET
options O
for O
seating O
guests. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
event O
the O
guests O
and O
the O
birthday O
girl O
were O
friendly O
and O
it O
was O
obvious O
that O
they O
were O
waiting O
for O
us. O

According O
to O
guest O
reviews, O
and O
in O
our O
opinion O
- O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
delightful O
(for O
which O
we O
thank O
the B-TARGET
chef)! I-TARGET

Beautiful O
dishes, B-TARGET
decoration, B-TARGET
serving, B-TARGET
and O
of O
course, O
the O
taste B-TARGET
- O
everything O
is O
at O
a O
high O
level. O

The O
work B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
was O
unnoticeable, O
dishes O
and O
dishes O
were O
changing O
as O
if O
by O
themselves. O

We O
can't O
help O
mentioning O
the O
work B-TARGET
of O
the O
manager O
Alexander. O

Thanks O
to O
him, O
our O
holiday O
was O
just O
a O
feast, O
and O
not O
a O
care O
about O
guests O
and O
food. O

You'd O
want O
to O
come O
back O
to O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
like O
this O
again. O

I O
will O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
to O
my O
friends O
and O
relatives, O
though O
some O
of O
them O
have O
seen O
it O
themselves! O

Thank O
you! O

What O
a O
great O
place! B-TARGET
On O
08.04.2010 O
we O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
on O
the O
second O
floor, O
from O
the O
very O
first O
meeting O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Anna O
has O
pleased O
us, O
we O
looked O
at O
a O
few O
other O
places O
and O
without O
delay O
decided O
to O
stop O
our O
choice O
on O
this O
cafe-relax. O

My O
wife O
chose O
for O
1550 O
(more O
expensive) O
and O
not O
a O
few O
regrets, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
food, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
very O
delicious O
and O
beautifully O
laid O
out, O
arranged, O
no O
one O
went O
hungry! O

There O
were O
no O
hungry O
people B-TARGET
at O
the O
hotel. O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
was O
attentive, O
cleared O
the O
table O
in O
good O
time, O
and O
were O
always O
ready O
to O
serve O
the O
hot O
appetizer O
and O
main O
course. O

Leftover O
liquor O
and O
food O
were O
put O
away O
and O
we O
all O
took O
something O
that O
day O
(relatives O
helped) O
something O
the O
next O
day. O

Very O
happy O
with O
this O
place! B-TARGET

Beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
nice O
music B-TARGET
and O
helpful O
staff. B-TARGET

My O
husband O
and O
I O
would O
love O
to O
go O
there O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner)) O

Thank O
you O
Anna O
for O
organizing O
such O
a O
wonderful O
holiday. O

We O
had O
a O
family O
dinner O
on O
April O
17, O
2010 O
in O
the O
afternoon. O

We O
chose O
this O
restaurant O
(rather O
a O
cafe). O

And O
we O
did O
not O
regret O
it. O

As O
we O
did O
not O
have O
any O
special O
requirements O
for O
the O
interior, O
except O
for O
an O
excellent O
view O
of B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
bay, I-TARGET
we O
got O
what O
we O
wanted. O

Unobtrusive O
music B-TARGET
and O
pretty O
decent O
waiters B-TARGET
(though, O
the O
tables O
were O
not O
laid O
out O
and O
the O
wine O
was O
not O
poured). O

But O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
really O
nice. O

Thank O
you O
to O
the B-TARGET
chef! I-TARGET

We O
ordered O
various O
salads O
and O
hot O
dishes O
for O
four O
people. O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
large, O
everything O
is O
deliciously O
prepared O
and O
served O
on O
time. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
having O
a O
delicious O
lunch O
after O
a O
walk. O

The O
prices O
are O
very O
affordable. O

I O
visited O
your O
restaurant O
on O
April O
17. O

From O
the O
street O
noticed O
your O
wonderful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
decided O
to O
have O
dinner O
there. O

First O
of O
all O
I O
liked O
it, O
is O
how O
I O
was O
greeted O
by O
your O
manager, B-TARGET
Ilya, O
all O
as O
I O
like, O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
humor. O

After O
I O
was O
seated O
at O
the O
table O
and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
that O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
kindly O
took O
my O
overcoat O
and O
hung O
it O
up O
in O
the O
checkroom O
... O
(I've O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
thing). O

As O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time O
I O
visited O
you, O
I O
am O
very O
grateful O
to O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
Valentin O
for O
the O
competent O
explanation O
of O
all O
my O
questions O
about O
the O
menu. O

And O
again, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
your O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
positive. O

Valentin O
radiated O
positivity O
and O
lifted O
my O
spirits O
very O
much O
after O
my O
workday O
... O
(Positive O
waiters B-TARGET
especially O
in O
the O
evening O
time O
is O
now O
a O
rarity). O

Having O
ordered O
a O
dish, O
it O
was O
very O
unexpected O
to O
get O
a O
compliment O
from O
the O
chef B-TARGET
- I-TARGET
venison I-TARGET
pate... O

That O
brightened O
up O
my O
waiting O
for O
the O
food O
I O
ordered. O

Fifteen O
minutes O
later O
I O
was O
already O
enjoying O
your O
masterpieces. O

Your O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
on O
par, O
as O
they O
say... O

I O
left O
satisfied O
and O
satiated) O

I O
hope O
your O
staff B-TARGET
is O
always O
as O
positive O
and O
friendly. O

I O
hope O
your O
restaurant O
promotes O
this O
and O
my O
review O
will O
not O
go O
unnoticed... O

Thank O
you! O

P.S. O
I O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
you O
again... O

Only O
with O
friends. O

I O
liked O
your O
cuisine B-TARGET
very O
much.) O

Thank O
you O
again! O

We O
visited O
Diana O
on O
04.02.2011. O
On O
the O
04/02/2011 O
we O
visited O
Diana O
(we O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
for O
family O
celebrations). O

Strangely O
enough O
there O
were O
no O
other O
visitors O
except O
us, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
Friday O
evening. O

Our O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
kind O
to O
us O
and O
we O
felt O
at O
home O
right O
away. O

We O
liked O
the O
interior: B-TARGET
solemn O
and O
refined, O
but O
not O
pompous. O

There O
are O
photos O
of O
famous O
guests O
on O
the O
walls O
near O
the O
bar. O

The O
hall O
is O
small, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
in O
the O
noble O
red O
and O
blue O
colors, O
which O
creates O
a O
sense O
of O
privacy O
and O
coziness. O

Decorative B-TARGET
windows I-TARGET
with O
a O
night O
landscape O
look O
especially O
splendid! O

The O
menu O
is B-TARGET
well-considered O
and O
varied, O
wonderful O
desserts B-TARGET
and O
banquets, I-TARGET
you O
can O
order O
a O
cake B-TARGET
of O
any O
complexity. O

We O
were O
particularly O
delighted O
with O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list. I-TARGET

The O
wine B-TARGET
recommended O
to O
us O
by O
the O
hospitable O
host B-TARGET
was O
beyond O
praise! O

In O
general O
all O
that O
we O
were O
offered O
for O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty. O

Of O
the O
minuses O
- O
was O
upsetting O
the O
women's O
toilet B-TARGET
(did O
not O
work O
the O
lock O
on O
the O
door), O
and O
in O
general O
the O
hall B-TARGET
look O
a O
little O
rusty O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
interior. O

On O
the O
whole O
we O
kept O
the O
warmest O
memories O
from O
visiting O
Diana, B-TARGET
we O
will O
by O
all O
means O
go O
back O
there O
ourselves O
and O
we O
can O
safely O
recommend O
this O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
both O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
and O
for O
a O
banquet O
for O
30-35 O
persons. O

Spoiled O
evening...(( O

I`ve O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
with O
my O
husband O
and O
also O
Valentine`s O
Day O
(February O
14). O

Booked O
a O
table O
a O
week O
in O
advance. O

Arrived O
on O
time, O
we O
were O
not O
reminded O
of O
us, O
we O
had O
a O
long O
search O
in O
some O
records, O
but O
hurrah! O
Found O
the O
note O
about O
the O
reserve O
table. O

We O
were O
seated. O

Music B-TARGET
from O
speakers O
was O
deafening O
at O
first, O
but O
then O
we O
got O
used O
to O
it. O

True, O
we O
could O
not O
talk O
quietly O
and O
did O
not O
succeed. O
(Couples O
at O
nearby O
tables O
were O
talking O
just O
as O
loudly O
about O
personal O
things, O
trying O
to O
overhear O
the O
speakers). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
on O
three, O
well, O
actually O
not O
for O
that O
we O
came. O

And O
what O
for? O
- O
Right, O
for O
meat! O

We O
ordered O
ribeye O
(590 O
rubles) O
and O
rack O
(about O
600 O
rubles), O
a O
couple O
of O
beers O
to O
brighten O
up O
the O
wait. O

Cuisine O
is O
not O
evaluated O
- O
because O
we O
could O
not O
try O
- O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
(!) O
steaks O
have O
not O
been O
brought O
to O
us... O

They O
didn't O
bring O
the O
food O
either O
for O
the O
other O
guests O
who O
were O
sitting O
next O
to O
us O
and O
had O
ordered O
at O
the O
same O
time... O

During O
the O
entire O
time O
we O
were O
waiting O
they O
came O
to O
us O
only O
twice, O
and O
that O
time O
at O
our O
insistent O
request. O

When O
we O
got O
completely O
bored O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
bill. O

The O
administrator B-TARGET
came O
over O
and O
started O
babbling O
about O
how O
many O
people O
were O
there O
(she O
was O
creeping), O
and O
that O
the O
cook B-TARGET
didn't O
have O
time. O

In O
general O
- O
we O
left O
hungry O
and O
upset. O

We O
will O
not O
go O
again. O

I O
really O
hope O
that O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
will O
be O
more O
lucky. O

Great O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
discovered O
it O
completely O
by O
accident O

to O
GRUPON. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
booked O
a O
table O
for O
my O
birthday O
three O

is O
just O
great O
and O
seems O
like O
an O
idea O
for O
a O
restaurant, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
space O
is O
rather O
small O
("non-smoking O
room O
overlooking O
the O
kitchen" O
and O
"smoking", O
and O
in O
the O
"smoking" B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
completely O
lacking O
extractor B-TARGET
hood, I-TARGET
I O
even O
imagined O
that O
would O
be O
if O
there O
are O
several O
companies O
gathered O
and O
so O
tightly O
smoke, O
have O
to O
open O
the O
window O
from O
which, O
incidentally, O
very O
much O
blowing O
- O
to O
the O
comfort O
immediately! O

As O
for O
the O
kitchen: B-TARGET
I O
went O
in O
hoping O
for O
good O
reviews O
on O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
was O
not O
mistaken! O

"Cream B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
porcini I-TARGET
mushrooms" I-TARGET
- O
delicious, O
I O
recommend O
it, O
all O
three O
of O
us O
liked O
it O
:) O

"Pizza B-TARGET
Pro I-TARGET
Dough" I-TARGET
- O
as O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time, O
we O
decided O
to O
understand O
at O
once O
"yes" O
or O
"no", O
having O
ordered O
a B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
of O
the O
biggest O
size O
and, O
again, O
we O
were O
not O
mistaken O
- O
the O
dough B-TARGET
is O
thin, O
crispy O
- O
score, O
the O
filling B-TARGET
was O
well O
chosen, O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
things, O
I O
can't O
remember O
the O
contents, O
I O
remember O
only O
the O
taste O
- O
excellent! O

As O
for O
the O
interior B-TARGET
: O
On O
the O
whole, O
quite O
cozy, O
just O
to O
play O
with O
the O
light O
would O
be O
something O
else, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
fix O
a O
window O
in O
the O
"smoking" B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
through O
which O
very O
much O
blew, O
about O
the O
lack O
of O
extractor B-TARGET
- O
wrote O
above. O

As O
for O
service: B-TARGET
Young, O
inexperienced O
:), O
but O
very O
friendly, O
I O
am O
satisfied O
with O
such O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite, O
and O
more O
is O
not O
required. O

Were O
there O
three O
of O
us O
at O
the O
end O
of O
January. O

The O
administrator, B-TARGET
cashier, I-TARGET
checkroom I-TARGET
attendant I-TARGET
(one O
person) O
was O
smiling. O

There O
were O
two O
girls B-TARGET
in O
black O
suits O
waiting O
around O
the O
fireplace O
all O
night O
and O
didn't O
help O
the O
waiters. B-TARGET

Just O
two O
statues O
with O
bored O
looks O
on O
their O
faces. O

Who O
were O
they? O

What O
was O
their O
function? O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
forgot O
to O
order, O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
she O
came O
back O
20 O
minutes O
later O
and O
asked O
again. O

Then O
we O
didn't O
see O
her O
at O
all O
for O
half O
an O
hour. O

At O
the O
end O
we O
ordered O
dessert. O

In O
15 O
minutes O
we O
found O
out O
that O
panacotta O
will O
be O
ready O
in O
about O
40 O
minutes. O

And O
there O
was O
only O
one O
tiramisu B-TARGET
left O
(Saturday O
afternoon O
around O
five). O

After O
coffee O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
bill. O

We O
waited O
a O
very O
long O
time, O
as O
the O
girl B-TARGET
(see O
above) O
was O
undressing O
and O
dressing O
the O
guests. O

Brought O
the O
bill, O
and O
another O
15 O
minutes O
were O
waiting O
for O
the O
change. O

We O
spent O
three O
hours O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
of O
which O
2 O
hours O
and O
a O
little O
more O
waiting. O

Didn't O
like O
it O
at O
all. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
tiny O
for O
not O
tiny O
prices. O

We O
went O
out O
and O
my O
husband O
said: O
"All O
the O
snow O
queens O
work O
here. O

Maybe O
they O
were O
tired, O
or O
maybe O
they're O
all O
having O
some O
kind O
of O
trouble. O

I O
don't O
know. O

But O
the O
desire O
to O
go O
there O
no O
more. O

P.S. O
The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice O
beige O
shades. O

But O
the O
sofas B-TARGET
were O
all O
dirty O
(non-smoking O
room)! O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much! O

Welcomed O
friendly O
and O
walked O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
menu O
and O
the O
dish O
were O
brought O
pretty O
quickly. O

Because O
of O
the O
high O
ceilings, O
there O
is O
no O
cigarette B-TARGET
smoke I-TARGET
smell O
- O
100 O
points O
just O
for O
that! O

The O
music B-TARGET
is O
great O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
(especially O
the O
Indian B-TARGET
food). I-TARGET

The O
steak B-TARGET
is O
perfect, O
although O
the O
sauce, B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion, O
should O
be O
different. O

The O
only O
minus O
was O
that O
it O
was O
cool O
in O
the O
checkroom B-TARGET
and O
the O
clothes O
were O
pretty O
cold. O

Impressions O
are O
great!!! O

Especially O
the O
bill O
seemed O
democratic O
- O
pleasantly O
surprised O
:) O

I O
recommend O
it!!! O

I've O
been O
to O
Daiquiri B-TARGET
many O
times O
already O
and O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
that O
it O
is O
the O
best O
bar B-TARGET
in O
the O
city! O

Firstly, O
we O
can O
not O
miss O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
bar O
and O
very O
friendly O
and O
welcoming O
staff! B-TARGET

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
success O
factors O
for O
any O
bar! O

The O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
great O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
really O
good! O

A O
great O
place O
to O
have O
a O
good O
time O
with O
your O
friends O
and O
enjoy O
tasty O
cocktails! B-TARGET

But O
it's O
better O
to O
book O
a O
place O
beforehand!) O

I O
was O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
February O
10 O
with O
coupons O
and O
a O
group O
of O
5 O
people O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O

It O
was O
very O
cool. O

To O
be O
honest O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
why O
there O
are O
bad O
reviews, O
maybe O
I O
was O
just O
lucky. O

I O
am O
a O
moderately O
picky O
person, O
but O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about, O
I O
will O
talk O
about O
the O
pluses: O

1) O
the O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
city O
center, O
near O
the O
subway O
- O
you O
can O
not O
think O
of O
a O
better O
place. O

2) O
The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
comfortable, O
the O
music B-TARGET
does O
not O
yell O
(although O
sat O
next O
to O
the O
speaker), O
playlist B-TARGET
pleases O
the O
ear O
( O
lounge O
if O
I O
am O
not O
mistaken). O

3) O
Service B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

Our O
waiter B-TARGET
(Ilya) O
was O
fun, O
friendly O
and O
very O
..... O
Sorry, O
could O
not O
pick O
up O
the O
words O
in O
Russian), O
professionally O
helped O
you O
select O
the O
menu, O
such O
a O
tip O
is O
a O
pleasure O
to O
leave. O

The O
room O
is O
very O
quiet O
and B-TARGET
well O
ventilated O
but O
the O
food O
is O
tasty. O

5) O
Prices O
do O
not O
bite, O
given O
that O
this O
is O
the O
center B-TARGET
of O
the O
city O
and O
compared O
to O
other O
sushi B-TARGET
bars O
=) O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
will O
gladly O
come O
again. O

On O
Saturday O
night, O
we O
went O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O

I O
got O
tired O
of O
Wasabi, O
so O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
something O
new. O

I O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
not O
all: O
spicy O
shrimp O
soup B-TARGET
was O
amazing, O
but O
the O
pork O
noodle B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
not O
so O
good O
- O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
tasteless, O
and O
the O
tiramisu B-TARGET
was O
tasty O
- O
very O
rare O
to O
get O
it O
cooked O
well. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
unobtrusive O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
don't O
have O
to O
wait. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
to O
your O
liking. O

I O
liked O
the O
place B-TARGET
but O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
playing O
too O
loud O
and O
I O
couldn't O
hear O
what O
they O
were O
saying.) O

Went O
to, O
go O
to, O
and O
will O
go O
to! O

I've O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
jazz O
club O
where O
we O
can O
not O
only O
hang O
out O
at O
the O
bar O
but O
have O
a O
nice O
meal O
and O
chat O
at O
the O
tables. O

We O
found O
it. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
table O
and O
not O
at O
the O
bar, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
book O
in O
advance. O

In O
the O
evening O
there O
is O
always O
an O
excellent O
program B-TARGET
of O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
and O
jazz. B-TARGET

Most O
of O
the O
guests O
come O
out O
to O
dance, O
many O
of O
them O
are O
professional O
dancers O
and O
it's O
always O
nice O
to O
watch O
them. O

People O
who O
like O
to O
drink O
heavily O
also O
drop O
by, O
but O
with O
them, O
of O
course, O
it's O
not O
very O
fun O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
each O
other. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
always O
good O
and O
everything O
is O
brought O
quickly. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
always O
tasty. O

We O
ordered O
ratatouille, O
fish O
and O
meat. O

Good O
wines B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
choice. O

Very O
nicely O
decorated B-TARGET
in O
a O
cosy O
and O
atmospheric O
environment. O

Perfect O
place O
for O
jazz O
and O
live O
music O
lovers! O

A O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
stay! O

Super O
interior, B-TARGET
very O
comfortable O
booths B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
soft I-TARGET
cushions. I-TARGET

Used O
to O
go O
there O
often O
for O
dinner O
after O
work. O

There O
is O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
food, B-TARGET
except O
that O
the O
fruit B-TARGET
and O
vegetables B-TARGET
might O
be O
of O
better O
quality O
since O
it O
is O
an O
oriental O
restaurant. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
always O
top O
notch. O

Good O
and O
lovely O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
a O
relaxing O
stay. O

Was O
invited O
to O
Amaren's O
for O
a O
friend's O
birthday O
party. O

I O
should O
say O
right O
away O
that O
I O
won't O
name O
any O
dishes, O
as O
the O
salads O
and O
meat O
and O
cheese O
plates O
were O
already O
ordered, O
and O
I O
didn't O
order O
hot O
dishes, O
but O
I O
managed O
to O
snip O
a O
piece O
of O
steak B-TARGET
from O
my O
beloved's O
plate O
....mmmm O
... O
I O
liked O
it, O
it O
was O
delicious. O

Salads B-TARGET
and O
appetizers B-TARGET
pleased O
me O
too: O
everything O
was O
beautifully O
decorated O
and O
tasted O
great. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
have O
corrected O
was O
the O
salted B-TARGET
cucumbers, I-TARGET
as O
they O
were O
tasteless. O

Our O
company O
was O
placed O
behind O
curtains O
so O
the O
presence O
of O
many O
campers O
did O
not O
interfere O
with O
us. O

It O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
we O
were O
served O
by O
an O
unknown O
person O
as O
dirty B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
disappeared O
so O
quickly O
from O
the O
table O
and O
drinks O
were O
refilled. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
comfortable O
and O
we O
were O
pleased O
to O
have O
a O
separate O
room B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
karaoke. I-TARGET

We O
sang O
till O
4 O
am. O

Thank O
you, O
everything O
was O
fine. O

I O
had O
a O
small O
company O
for O
my O
birthday. O

Bathroom O
was O
very O
well, O
but O
not O
very O
nice. O

On O
the O
plus O
side O
was O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

Bright O
aged O
furniture, B-TARGET
jars B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
compote, I-TARGET
cereals, I-TARGET
interesting. O

I O
liked O
the O
homemade O
drinks. B-TARGET

Hot B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
- O
tasty, O
but O
small O
portions. B-TARGET

Dessert B-TARGET
Chocolate I-TARGET
Box I-TARGET
and O
carrot B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
Philly O
cheese O
- O
very, O
very O
nice. O

The O
main O
room B-TARGET
was O
not O
too O
smoky. O

The O
non-smoking O
room O
was O
occupied O
for O
a O
wedding, O
had O
to O
reserve O
a O
table O
in O
the O
smoking O
room. O

Of O
the O
minuses: O
no O
checkroom. B-TARGET

It O
is O
not O
nice O
when O
during O
the O
meal O
someone O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
standing O
and O
waiting O
in O
their O
outer O
clothing O
for O
their O
friends O
on O
the O
table. O

The B-TARGET
hangers I-TARGET
are O
overloaded O
with O
clothes O
and O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
them. O

There O
are O
plenty O
of O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
catch O
your O
own. O

Perhaps O
we O
were O
at O
rush O
hour. O

Drinks O
(not O
cocktails) O
waited O
30 O
minutes O
from O
order O
time. O

The O
girls-administrators B-TARGET
do O
not O
have O
badges O
and O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
distinguish O
them O
from O
the O
guests. O

In O
the O
menu B-TARGET
there O
is O
no O
indication O
of O
portion O
weight. O

You O
have O
to O
ask O
the B-TARGET
waitress, I-TARGET
she O
rolls O
her O
eyes O
and O
strains O
to O
remember O
what O
the O
dish O
looks O
like. O

I O
didn't O
like O
churkhela, B-TARGET
it O
was O
frozen O
and O
tasteless. O

Yesterday O
we O
decided O
to O
discover O
another O
Italian O
restaurant. O

Familiar O
people O
advised O
Super O
Mario. O

That's O
where O
we O
went. O

We O
were O
not O
disappointed, O
but O
we O
were O
not O
particularly O
pleased O
either. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
not O
very O
good: O
rather O
boring O
interior, B-TARGET
lack O
of O
space O
and O
only O
one O
table O
was O
occupied O
- O
and O
it O
was O
on O
a O
weekend O
evening O
... O

But O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
coffee O
anyway. O

I O
ordered O
a O
latte B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
baileys I-TARGET
- O
it O
was O
very O
fast O
and O
delicious! O

My O
husband O
got O
a O
green B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
- O
very O
good O
too. O

We O
relieved O
ourselves O
and O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch: O
I O
ordered O
cream B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
of O
mushrooms, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
tasteless, O
but O
at O
least O
the O
portion B-TARGET
was O
big. O

My O
husband O
had O
literally O
3 O
tablespoons B-TARGET
of O
chicken O
broth O
- O
very O
little. O

The B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
basket I-TARGET
was O
boring O
and O
not O
really O
tasty. O

My O
husband's O
lasagna B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
good... O

But O
I O
was O
happy O
with O
tiramisu B-TARGET
- O
delicious, O
but O
served O
ugly O
in O
a O
cup... O

In O
general, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
good. O

The O
drinks B-TARGET
are O
really O
good. O

A O
huge O
plus O
is O
the O
restroom. B-TARGET

Very O
clean, O
neat, O
all O
kinds O
of O
towels O
and O
spacious O
- O
and O
in O
fact O
a O
good O
toilet B-TARGET
- O
this O
is O
also O
very O
important O
for O
a O
restaurant, O
I O
think. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
polite... O

I'd O
give O
them O
a O
4 O
on O
a O
scale O
of O
5. O

It O
bothered O
us O
that O
they O
cleaned O
the O
floor O
in O
the O
hall O
at O
the O
entrance O
- O
and O
we O
watched O
it...not O
so O
much. O

The O
bill O
was O
ok, O
not O
too O
expensive, O
but O
not O
cheap. O

The O
bill O
was O
okay, O
not O
too O
expensive, O
but O
not O
cheap. O

I O
don't O
think O
we O
will O
go O
back O
there. O

Hi O
Hi, O
I O
was O
in O
a O
restaurant O
recently, O
we O
live O
nearby. O

We O
had O
dinner O
there O
and O
we O
were O
really O
pleased O
with O
the O
food, O
it O
was O
ok. O

It B-TARGET
is O
spacious, O
yet O
very O
comfortable. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
took O
our O
order O
and O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long. O

We O
had O
a O
different O
company, O
so O
we O
ordered O
different O
dishes O
to O
taste. O

Our O
salads, B-TARGET
soup B-TARGET
and O
lamb B-TARGET
sausages I-TARGET
were O
very O
tasty, O
just O
a O
song. O

The O
knuckle B-TARGET
went O
off O
without O
a O
hitch! O

With O
beer! O

The O
beer B-TARGET
was O
excellent, O
maybe O
not O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
but O
nobody O
had O
any O
complaints O
to O
its O
taste, O
everything O
was O
fresh. O

All O
the O
guys O
were O
satisfied O
and O
full. O

Even O
our O
child, O
who O
was O
ordered O
dessert, B-TARGET
also O
said O
that O
it O
was O
delicious, O
so O
you O
can O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
company O
can O
drink O
beer O
with O
the O
family O
and O
just O
have O
dinner. O

I O
recommend O
it))) O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
wanted O
to O
write O
a O
review O
of O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
as O
it O
was O
a O
really O
nice O
impression O
... O

Very O
cozy O
interior O
and O
a O
picturesque O
place, O
though O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Savings O
Bank O
next O
to O
spoil O
a O
picture O
... O
but O
it O
already O
other O
question. O

As O
far O
as O
cuisine O
goes, O
I O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
dishes O
which O
I O
tried O
out: O
baked O
dorado O
and O
pasta O
with O
spinach. O

I O
liked O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
very O
much, O
it O
was O
80% O
of O
the O
success O
of O
the O
dish. O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
impressed O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
less, O
probably O
because O
I O
was O
not O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
was O
not O
as O
tender O
as O
I O
had O
hoped. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
really O
not O
that O
big, O
but O
everything O
is O
very O
accurate O
and O
in O
the O
right O
quantity. O
Perfect O
to O
feel O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
dish, O
but O
not O
to O
get O
bored. O

The O
black B-TARGET
caesar I-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
decent, O
made O
with O
taste. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleased: O
when O
they O
cleaned O
my O
fish O
- O
I O
was O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
- O
this O
is O
already O
a O
level. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
they O
added O
sugar O
to O
the O
pineapple B-TARGET
fraiche I-TARGET
for O
300 O
rubles. O
If O
so, O
it's O
more O
of O
a O
minus, O
because O
it O
kills O
all O
the O
natural O
flavor... O

And O
in O
general O
I O
liked O
it O
most O
of O
all O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
clearly O
ready O
to O
improve O
all O
the O
time O
and O
respect O
their O
customer. O

It O
bribes O
the O
most. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
come O
back O
and O
try O
a O
couple O
of O
desserts O
and O
spinach O
soup...for O
starters=) O

I O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone, O
it's O
a O
restaurant O
that O
I O
wouldn't O
be O
ashamed O
to O
recommend. O

I O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
place O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
to O
this O
sports O
bar O
just O
to O
have O
a O
rest O
somewhere O
in O
the O
afternoon O
between O
business O
and O
to O
watch O
something. O

I O
got O
myself O
the O
usual O
Caesar O
salad O
and O
ice O
cream O
with O
Latte O
coffee. O

It O
is O
nice O
when O
the O
bar O
can O
make O
coffee B-TARGET
good O
without O
burning O
it O
out O
and O
everything O
else O
was O
done O
well O
and O
skillfully, O
the O
orders O
were O
brought O
to O
me O
very O
quickly, O
considering O
that O
during O
the O
day O
there O
were O
quite O
a O
few O
people O
there. O

There O
was O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
relaxation O
and O
detachment O
from O
everything. O

The O
right O
interior, B-TARGET
as O
in O
a O
normal O
men's O
pub O
with O
reasonable O
prices O
and O
pretty O
waitresses. B-TARGET

The O
only O
minus O
for O
me O
is O
that O
the O
pub O
is O
quite O
far O
from O
the O
house, O
but O
still O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
more O
pluses O
and O
now O
I O
know O
where O
to O
watch O
soccer O
and O
where O
I O
will O
come O
in O
the O
evening). O

I O
have O
wanted O
to O
visit O
this O
place O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

On O
09.05.2014 O
I O
booked O
a O
table O
by O
phone O
2 O
hours O
before O
my O
visit. O

However, O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
empty O
tables. O

I O
will O
be O
very O
brief O
in O
my O
remarks. O

Food: B-TARGET
Delicious, O
super O
- O
10 O
points. O

Staff B-TARGET
: O
polite O
and O
friendly. O

Interior: B-TARGET
simple, O
neat O
and O
without O
any O
frills. O

Check O
amount: O
3500-3700 O
(+ O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine). O

There O
is O
a O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
which O
is O
undoubtedly O
important. O

The O
most O
unpleasant O
thing O
happened O
during O
the O
dinner O
itself! O

It O
was O
like O
in O
a O
bad O
movie! O

My O
companion O
was O
brought O
ordered O
dish, O
he O
peppered O
it O
well, O
with O
all O
his O
heart O
(as O
he O
likes O
it O
at O
home), O
took O
a O
knife O
and O
fork, O
and O
then O
comes O
running O
waitress B-TARGET
with O
the O
words O
"you O
still O
have O
time? O

Turns O
out O
the O
couple O
at O
the O
next O
table O
had O
ordered O
the O
same O
dish O
and O
it O
was O
meant O
for O
them. O

And O
you O
won't O
believe O
it! O

After O
the O
food O
was O
"taken O
away" O
from O
us, O
this O
dish O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
couple O
at O
the O
next O
table! O

No O
words! O

The O
mood O
of O
the O
evening's O
dinner O
was O
ruined. O

I O
understand, O
everyone O
is O
human, O
they O
can O
make O
mistakes. O

But! O

Both O
we O
and O
the O
couple O
in O
this O
situation O
looked O
idiotic. O

After O
all, O
we O
could O
have O
apologized O
to O
that O
couple O
and O
asked O
them O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
longer O
for O
the O
dish O
to O
be O
ready. O

I O
think O
that O
was O
the O
only O
way O
out. O

Would O
I O
go O
to O
that O
place O
again? O

Probably, O
yes, O
but O
only O
for O
lunch. O
