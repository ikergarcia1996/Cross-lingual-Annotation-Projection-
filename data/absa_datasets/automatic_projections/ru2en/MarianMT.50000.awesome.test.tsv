A O
very O
nice, O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
modest O
prices O
for O
huge O
meals B-TARGET
of O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

We O
celebrated O
our O
birthday, O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
bring O
our O
candle O
cake. O

Fresh O
green B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
meat B-TARGET
and O
chicken B-TARGET
are O
tender, O
and O
dessert, B-TARGET
in O
particular O
Semifreddo B-TARGET
almonds, I-TARGET
is O
something O
fabulous. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
smiling. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
didn't O
like O
was O
waiting O
a O
long O
time O
to O
start O
the O
service B-TARGET
(probably O
because O
of O
the O
large O
numbers O
of O
people) O
and O
no O
one O
was O
cleaning O
the O
dishes O
from O
the O
nearby O
tables O
when O
the O
people O
left. O

But O
it's O
nothing. O

The O
general O
impression O
is O
beautiful. O

We O
advise! O

It's O
a O
great O
restaurant, B-TARGET
I've O
been O
here O
a O
lot O
and O
I've O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O

And O
I O
and O
all O
the O
guests O
were O
very O
happy. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
level, O
all O
fresh, O
tasty O
and O
authentic) O

I'd O
especially O
like O
to O
celebrate O
the O
liquor-- B-TARGET
the O
wine B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
incredible. O

The O
musicians B-TARGET
were O
happy O
to O
play O
the O
mind, O
so O
we O
didn't O
miss O
the O
chance O
to O
dance. O

The O
bill O
for O
all O
this O
glamour O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
small, O
especially O
since O
we O
were O
sitting O
for O
six O
hours O
and O
we O
weren't O
denying O
ourselves O
anything. O

Of O
the O
small O
shortcomings O
- O
the O
cigars B-TARGET
were O
too O
old O
- O
too O
dry, O
forgot O
to O
put O
a O
few O
snacks O
on O
the O
table O
(otherwise, O
it O
was O
for O
the O
best O
- O
we O
wouldn't O
have O
done O
it O
anymore), O
the O
receptionist B-TARGET
should O
be O
a O
little O
more O
welcoming O
and O
more O
interested O
in O
the O
process O
- O
for O
example, O
helping O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
food, O
advice, O
not O
just O
writing O
with O
a O
bored O
face. O

Overall, O
the O
party O
was O
a O
success, O
and O
everything O
was O
on O
its O
level. O

We'll O
come O
to O
you O
again! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful! O

For O
me, O
it's O
just O
the O
perfect O
interior B-TARGET
of O
a O
small O
restaurant. O

It's O
very O
cozy, O
it's O
kind O
of O
warm O
and O
homey, O
and O
it's O
also O
very, O
very O
nice O
and O
tasteful. O

I O
don't O
want O
to O
leave. O

Prices O
are O
very O
affordable O
for O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Now O
it's O
about O
negatives. O

First O
of O
all, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
weird. O

We O
may O
have O
just O
caught O
an O
unfriendly O
waiter, B-TARGET
but O
he O
also O
had O
a O
repulsive O
way O
of O
speaking. O

Besides, O
I O
was O
just O
surprised O
that O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
didn't O
speak O
English, O
or O
they O
did, O
but O
they O
kept O
it O
a O
secret. O

For O
some O
reason, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
talking O
only O
to O
me, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
translate O
this O
to O
a O
foreign O
satellite, O
and O
then O
he O
was O
surprised O
to O
ask O
me O
-- O
they O
don't O
speak O
English? O

For O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
downtown, O
I O
don't O
think O
that's O
acceptable. O

But O
that's O
not O
all-- O
instead O
of O
one O
soup, O
they O
brought O
me O
another O
one O
without O
warning. O

I O
didn't O
notice O
it O
right O
away, O
and O
I O
didn't O
feel O
like O
fighting O
at O
all O
that O
night, O
so O
I O
didn't O
call O
the O
waiter O
and O
figure O
it O
out. O

The O
kitchen, O
I O
can O
tell O
you, O
I O
didn't O
like O
Claret's B-TARGET
special I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
at O
all, O
there's O
no O
claim O
to O
guilt B-TARGET
and O
dessert, B-TARGET
I O
didn't O
take O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
but O
my O
friend O
liked O
it. O

In O
general, O
the O
impressions O
from O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
are O
very O
good, O
but O
it O
could O
have O
been O
better O
if O
it O
hadn't O
been O
for O
a O
strange O
service. B-TARGET

It O
brought O
us O
here O
a O
huge O
desire O
to O
eat O
meat, O
drink O
quality O
beer O
and O
watch O
the O
Zenith-Twente O
match. O

Let's O
get O
this O
straight. O

We're O
having O
a O
happy O
meeting. B-TARGET
) O

It's O
good O
to O
see O
you. O

Elena's O
pretty O
blonde B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
walked O
us O
out O
and O
offered O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
only O
free O
table. O

Not O
quite O
comfortable, O
but O
it O
doesn't O
matter. O

'Cause O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
sit O
comfortably, O
we O
were O
asked O
to O
move O
in) O

She O
gave O
us O
the O
menu O
and O
gave O
us O
time O
to O
think. O

Before O
the O
girl O
came, O
we O
didn't O
think O
of O
anything O
like O
that. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
Tower B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
first O
to O
the O
chef, O
very O
tasty O
cook, O
second O
to O
the O
girl B-TARGET
for O
the O
advice. O

Cesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
also O
made O
us O
very O
happy, O
and O
the O
cakes B-TARGET
were O
gorgeous. O

The O
beer B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
tasted O
different O
things, O
and O
for O
three O
Velvets, O
my O
friend O
got O
another O
towel O
brand-fashioned.)) O

Nice O
little O
things, O
but O
very O
happy. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
calm O
and O
non-binding. O

Soft O
couchs, B-TARGET
comfortable, O
which O
is O
very O
important O
right O
now! O

It's O
a O
good O
match O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
tables. O

Overall O
assessment O
9 O
out O
of O
10. O

Why O
9? O

Because O
there's O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
ventilation. B-TARGET

Very O
stoned. O

That's O
how O
we O
really O
liked O
it. O

Everyone O
was O
satisfied. O

We'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure.) O

Your O
prosperity O
and O
success) O

Thanks O
to O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
having O
breakfast O
at O
this O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
yesterday. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
have O
already O
written O
about O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
that O
it's O
homemade. O

I O
couldn't O
agree O
more. O

I O
rarely O
ate O
oatmeal B-TARGET
cooked O
almost O
the O
same O
way O
I O
cook O
it O
at O
home. O

The O
line B-TARGET
was O
very O
decent! O

She O
also O
ordered O
herself O
a O
Napoleon O
sample. O

The O
cake B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
it O
was O
big, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
cooked O
anywhere O
since O
my O
grandmother O
was O
cooking... O
but O
it's O
still O
good. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
but O
I O
wasn't O
excited. O

I O
don't O
think O
there's O
anything O
more O
to O
an O
institution O
like O
this. O

Although O
sofas B-TARGET
could O
be O
made O
nice, O
more O
homemade, O
with O
pillows. O

And O
in O
some O
ways O
the O
glass O
door O
to O
the O
bathroom B-TARGET
was O
confused, O
given O
that O
there's O
a O
table O
in O
front O
of O
her O
and O
that O
there O
may O
be O
visitors O
sitting O
there, O
it's O
kind O
of O
uncomfortable. O

I O
expected O
it O
to O
be O
more O
apartment, O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
more O
cafeteria. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quiet, O
it's O
hard O
to O
say O
more, O
because O
I O
was O
practically O
alone. O

I O
think O
I'm O
gonna O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place O
for O
lunch O
and O
dinner. O

Great O
place, B-TARGET
very O
good O
cooking, O
huge O
meals, B-TARGET
we O
had O
one O
hot B-TARGET
order O
for O
four O
and O
we O
couldn't O
finish. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
nothing O
special, O
clean O
and O
quiet, O
music O
in O
the O
next O
room, O
but O
we O
specifically O
wanted O
no O
music. O

A O
polite O
and O
helpful O
waitress, B-TARGET
you O
can O
bring O
the O
alcohol O
with O
you, O
but O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
something O
else O
from O
them. O

It's O
all O
very O
nice, O
we'll O
come O
back.) O

The O
place B-TARGET
isn't O
cheap! O

The O
big O
mine O
is O
that O
they O
don't O
sell O
alcohol B-TARGET
separately, O
only O
in O
cocktails! B-TARGET

At O
least O
that's O
what O
the O
bartender O
told O
me. O

Wine B-TARGET
only O
in O
small O
individual O
bottles, O
no O
beer B-TARGET
at O
all!!! O

Some O
salads O
have O
been O
ordered, O
so O
we've O
had O
them O
cooked O
for O
over O
an O
hour!!!!! O
even O
though O
there O
was O
only O
one O
company O
in O
the O
bar O
other O
than O
us. O

I O
don't O
know O
what O
the O
cook O
was O
doing O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

The O
bartender's B-TARGET
been O
telling O
us O
all O
along O
that O
our O
salads O
are O
almost O
ready. O

Anyway, O
no O
matter O
how O
nice O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is, O
I O
don't O
feel O
like O
coming O
here O
anymore. O

Nice O
place! B-TARGET

It's O
so O
rare O
to O
mix O
a O
comfortable O
environment, B-TARGET
a O
good O
kitchen, B-TARGET
and O
a O
decent O
service. B-TARGET

And O
the O
price O
tag O
is O
very O
democratic. O

We O
went O
together O
with O
a O
friend. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
decent, O
we O
met O
at O
the O
entrance, O
we O
drove O
all O
over O
the O
place, O
we O
all O
showed O
up, O
we O
waited O
patiently O
until O
we O
finally O
decided O
where O
to O
sit, O
even O
though O
we O
chose O
for O
a O
long O
time) O

Luckily O
she O
was O
free O
to O
steal) O

Put O
their O
pillows O
on, O
fall O
apart O
in O
a O
crab, B-TARGET
all O
grace. O

The O
food O
arrived O
fast O
enough: O
the O
drinks O
were O
almost O
immediately, O
salad O
in O
15 O
minutes, O
hot O
in O
10 O
minutes O
after O
the O
salads. O

The O
food B-TARGET
enjoyed O
it, O
especially O
dessert B-TARGET
- O
napoleon, B-TARGET
very O
tasty. O

Anyway, O
despite O
my O
previous O
review, O
I'm O
going O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
there. O

By O
the O
way, O
I've O
ordered O
a O
Cosmopolitan, B-TARGET
a O
normal O
cocktail B-TARGET
and O
enough O
alcohol. O

The O
name O
of O
the O
restaurant O
requires O
a O
taste O
of O
this O
very O
dish, B-TARGET
the O
variety O
of O
which O
is O
pleasantly O
surprising. O

We O
chose O
Cheburecs B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
potatoes, I-TARGET
and O
with O
creamed B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
it O
was O
delicious! O

It's O
a O
very O
rich, O
delicate O
dish, B-TARGET
a O
little O
spicy, O
not O
fat O
at O
all, O
I O
recommend! O

There O
was O
also O
a O
trout O
salad B-TARGET
that O
I'd O
bet O
7 O
out O
of O
10 O
on O
my O
taste O
of O
a O
failed O
combination O
of O
ingredients, O
vegetables O
were O
given O
an O
excessive O
amount O
of O
juice, O
and O
it O
didn't O
look O
solid. O

The O
pork O
chash B-TARGET
was O
almost O
tasty O
if O
it O
hadn't O
been O
for O
a O
salted B-TARGET
piece I-TARGET
(one O
out O
of O
5). O

It's O
a O
shame O
we O
don't O
eat O
lamb, O
the O
food O
from O
this O
meat O
is O
the O
most O
on O
the O
menu. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
speed B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
delivery I-TARGET
were O
just O
amazing, O
the O
cheerleaders O
brought O
in O
four O
minutes O
later, O
the O
drinks O
even O
faster, O
the O
barbecue O
was O
served O
at O
the O
right O
time, O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
was O
the O
surrender O
(in O
many O
places, O
it's O
been O
calculated O
for O
10 O
minutes O
and O
longer...) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
was O
nice, O
we O
were O
resting O
on O
benches B-TARGET
across O
from O
each O
other, O
like O
in O
a O
private O
gazebo, O
and O
we O
weren't O
disturbed. O

When O
we O
left, O
looked O
in O
all O
the O
halls, O
we O
liked O
the O
fireplace, B-TARGET
where O
we O
could O
have O
a O
nice O
romantic O
evening. O

The O
light O
room B-TARGET
is O
good, O
too, O
except O
we O
thought O
there O
were O
too O
many O
tables. O

Summary: O
A O
quality, O
cozy O
and O
delicious O
place, B-TARGET
we're O
gonna O
walk O
around. O

We O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Appetite, O
we O
weren't O
there O
before, O
we O
made O
a O
reservation, O
and O
when O
we O
came, O
we O
were O
a O
little O
disappointed, O
because O
the O
table B-TARGET
was O
right O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door, O
we O
wanted O
to O
sit O
down O
after O
the O
other O
one, O
but O
we O
were O
nicely O
told O
that O
someone O
else O
would O
sit O
down O
while O
the O
waiter O
left O
us O
quickly O
at O
the O
other O
table O
across O
the O
street, O
because O
we O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
warmer. O

Fuck O
us O
on O
those O
coldest O
days. O

And O
it O
was O
cold, O
sitting O
in O
jackets. O

The O
people O
who O
came, O
sometimes O
they O
didn't O
watch O
the O
doors, O
they O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
doors O
to O
be O
closed. O

The O
staff O
girl B-TARGET
then O
felt O
sorry O
for O
us, O
asked O
if O
we O
were O
cold, O
but O
it O
was O
obvious. O

We O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
rolls. B-TARGET

The O
interior's B-TARGET
interesting. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
halls B-TARGET
are O
more O
cozy, O
so O
it's O
cold O
in O
this O
room, B-TARGET
which O
at O
the O
entrance O
is O
better O
not O
to O
order O
a O
table.)) O

Visited O
the O
establishment O
on O
February O
23rd. O

Nice O
to O
meet O
you, O
to O
the O
wardrobe O
and O
to O
the O
table. O

On O
the O
second O
floor, O
most O
of O
the O
tables O
were O
occupied O
or O
there O
was O
a O
reserve, O
but O
there O
was O
room O
for O
the O
three O
of O
us. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
conveniently O
made-selected O
grill O
folders, O
Japanese O
menus, O
and O
Italian. O

As O
a O
result, O
they O
were O
sitting O
with O
them O
like O
monkeys O
in O
a O
postcard O
shop)) O

All O
the O
men O
on O
the O
23rd O
of O
February O
are O
having O
a O
vodka O
present. O

Most O
of O
the O
sushi O
was O
ordered. O

Drinks O
weren't O
expected O
for O
very O
long, O
10 O
minutes, O
but O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
orders, O
it's O
complicated... O

First O
they O
brought O
the O
girl's O
salad, O
and O
we O
sat O
around O
and O
licked. O

Then O
the O
soup O
is O
for O
a O
friend, O
and O
then O
all O
the O
sushis B-TARGET
(minus O
30) O
are O
delicious, O
salmon O
salad B-TARGET
is O
mediocre O
enough. O

The O
kim-chi B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
and O
it's B-TARGET
big. O

The O
impressions O
are O
cozy, O
tasty, O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-TARGET
for O
all O
tastes. O

I'm O
sorry O
that O
I O
don't O
deal O
with O
every O
dish O
in O
detail, O
because O
the O
impressions O
are O
common, O
and O
we O
didn't O
order O
anything O
special. O

We O
weren't O
often O
removed O
from O
the O
table, O
and O
different O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
everyone O
was O
kind O
enough O
to O
smile. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
friend O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2010, O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
pretty, O
sitting O
on O
a O
terrace. O

The O
service O
got O
upset O
at O
first: O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
put O
us O
at O
a O
table O
and O
left. O
The O
menu O
on O
the O
table O
wasn't O
there, O
we O
expected O
to O
be O
brought O
in, O
about O
10 O
minutes O
waiting, O
but O
nobody O
was O
there. O
Then O
he O
managed O
to O
catch O
another O
boy O
and O
ask O
him O
to O
bring O
him, O
he O
was O
shocked O
that O
we O
didn't O
even O
have O
a O
menu O
yet, O
he O
took O
an O
order, O
food O
and O
cocktails O
quickly, O
served O
well O
and O
carefully, O
rather O
than O
fixed O
the O
initial O
negative O
impression. O

Kitchen O
is O
common O
in O
my O
opinion, O
nothing O
special, O
but O
prices O
are O
clearly O
high. O

Charlotte's B-TARGET
really O
tasty, O
homemade O
:) O
for O
desserts, B-TARGET
I'd O
come O
again. O

Well, O
it's O
just O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
little O
chat. O

What O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
is, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
tight. O

It's O
not O
nice O
to O
sit O
close O
to O
other O
tables O
and O
have O
to O
listen O
to O
other O
people's O
conversations. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
men O
who O
sit O
around, O
and O
they O
don't O
hesitate O
to O
look O
down, O
like O
they're O
coming O
out O
on O
purpose. O

It O
seemed O
that O
both O
men O
and O
women O
went O
there O
to O
look O
for O
acquaintances O
for O
easy O
time. O

Other O
than O
that, O
it's O
pretty O
cute. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
tonight. O

We've O
been O
offered O
a O
vip-cabinet. O

We O
loved O
everything, O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

I O
loved O
it O
so O
much O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
invite O
our O
friends O
to O
celebrate O
our O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
administrator B-TARGET
of O
Victoria O
immediately O
drew O
up O
a O
menu, O
took O
all O
our O
wishes O
into O
account, O
gave O
advice O
on O
the O
reception. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
meeting O
of O
friends, O
eight O
of O
us, O
and O
everyone O
was O
very O
happy. O

And O
a O
beautiful O
separate O
room B-TARGET
(see O
photo O
gallery) O
and O
a O
thoughtful O
but O
non-addictive O
staff, B-TARGET
and O
an O
original O
kitchen B-TARGET
(we O
took O
eight O
different O
hot B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
each O
said O
it O
had O
the O
best O
taste) O
was O
just O
super. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
a O
lovely O
evening, O
we'll O
come O
again. O

P.S. O
By O
the O
way, O
there's O
a O
great O
restaurant B-TARGET
website, I-TARGET
a O
menu!!! B-TARGET
photo... O

Our O
wedding O
party O
was O
held O
on O
July O
10th. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
express O
our O
great O
gratitude O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
and, O
separately, O
to O
Administrator B-TARGET
Elena O
for O
her O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
was O
chosen O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
never O
regretted O
its O
choice. O

On O
the O
plus O
side, O
I'll O
call O
it O
a O
great O
restaurant O
location B-TARGET
(if O
there O
are O
visitors O
from O
other O
cities, O
it's O
especially O
important). O

We O
liked O
the O
food B-TARGET
itself, O
the O
cook B-TARGET
was O
a O
miracle! O
We O
picked O
a O
menu O
for O
1,500 O
per O
person, O
ordered O
a O
meal O
from O
the O
chef O
and O
another O
salad, O
but O
without O
our O
supplements, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
enough. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
a O
very O
suitable O
atmosphere B-TARGET
for O
weddings, O
so O
comfortable O
and O
solemn! O

We O
had O
32 O
guests, O
all O
very O
good O
impressions. O

Thank O
you! O

Alfie O
and O
Ivan. O

He O
is O
often O
visited O
by O
Tan O
Wife O
on O
the O
Great O
V.O. O

The O
impressions O
are O
only O
positive. O
(The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
rather O
modest, O
noisy, O
but) O

It's O
hard O
enough O
to O
get O
on O
this O
weekend, O
so O
it's O
better O
to O
book O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

Several O
times O
on O
weekends O
without O
an O
order, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
is O
always O
able O
to O
find O
a O
free O
table.)) O

I O
really O
like O
the O
service: B-TARGET
fast, O
huge, O
helpful O
waiters. B-TARGET

They O
ordered O
a O
feast O
hall. O

Pleasure O
to O
have O
a O
personal O
approach O
to O
clients. O

It's O
better O
to O
go O
to O
the O
company: O
we O
usually O
order O
two O
salads O
and O
two O
hot O
ones O
for O
four. O

Favorite O
dishes: O
Troy's B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
squid B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
tongue. B-TARGET

I O
think O
the O
only O
reason O
we O
should O
visit O
this O
place O
is O
because O
of O
a O
special B-TARGET
dish: I-TARGET
eggplants B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
soy I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

And O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
delicious: O
the O
fruit B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
hot O
caramel!!! O

Anyway, O
a O
mental O
institution... B-TARGET

I O
wanted O
to O
have O
dinner O
with O
a O
girl, O
but O
we O
weren't O
lucky-- O
that's O
the O
day O
they O
cut O
the O
power. O

The O
girl O
who O
serves O
us O
said O
that O
the O
kitchen O
can't O
offer O
us O
a O
hot O
meal O
(and O
also O
a O
few O
cold O
ones). O

We O
haven't O
been O
able O
to O
order O
anything O
hot, O
so O
I'm O
not O
gonna O
bet O
the O
kitchen, O
but O
what O
we O
ordered O
left O
no O
positive O
or O
negative O
impressions. O

We O
ordered O
a O
caesar O
salad, O
a O
cheese O
plate, O
a O
girl O
took O
a O
glass O
of O
Bardot O
wine, O
I O
took O
a O
lemonade O
because O
I O
was O
driving. O

It O
looked O
very O
comic O
like O
the O
waiter O
who O
brought O
the O
order O
gave O
me O
a O
wine O
glass O
of O
bottled O
lemonade O
:) O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
nice, O
I O
like O
it. O

It's O
very O
romantic O
to O
sit O
on O
a O
veranda B-TARGET
and O
look O
at O
a O
channel... O

Probably O
because O
the O
canals O
can O
only O
see O
nothing, O
but O
as O
they've O
written O
before O
me, O
you O
can O
have O
fun O
looking O
at O
the O
students O
of O
the O
evening O
finale. O

The O
winter O
and O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
were O
pretty O
cold O
right O
now, O
so O
the O
girl O
is O
very O
cold. O

There's O
a O
patch O
on O
every O
chair, O
but O
they O
didn't O
even O
save O
it. O

Even O
though O
our O
order O
wasn't O
big O
enough O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
if O
you O
don't O
say O
too O
long. O

It's O
like O
they've O
grown O
a O
new O
grape O
and O
already O
made O
the O
wine O
they O
offered. O

I'd O
also O
like O
to O
highlight O
the O
speciality O
of O
the O
menu O
- O
a O
lot O
of O
peaches. O

I O
hope O
to O
see O
it O
again O
when O
it's O
warm O
on O
the O
street O
and O
when O
there's O
light O
in O
the O
place. O

We O
visited O
this O
cafe O
today. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
no O
big O
deal, O
but O
it's O
cozy. O

There's O
quiet O
quiet O
music B-TARGET
playing. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good. O

I O
ate O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
(I O
think O
it O
was O
Linda)-- O
it O
tasted O
good, O
but O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
was O
salty. O

And O
of O
course, O
when O
I O
read O
the O
reports O
about O
Napoleon, O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
it! O

It's O
delicious, O
it's O
not O
fat, O
it's O
tender. O

And O
most O
importantly, O
it's O
not O
very O
sweet, O
as O
it O
happens. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
desserts B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu. O

In O
general, O
it's O
a O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
and O
considering O
it's O
a O
cafe, O
it's O
a O
really O
good O
place. O

Yesterday, O
they O
came O
to O
Tokyo, O
they O
came O
from O
Mirage, O
they O
went O
to O
Eurasia O
first... O
but O
it's O
a O
good O
thing O
there O
wasn't O
room! O

Remembering O
from O
the O
restocklab O
that O
Tokyo O
is O
next, O
let's O
go O
there! O

I O
liked O
the O
big O
hall, B-TARGET
where O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
comfortable O
seats O
on O
the O
couch B-TARGET
that O
we O
could O
really O
talk O
about, O
no O
noise, O
no O
loud O
music. O

It O
appeared O
that O
the O
officers B-TARGET
were O
still O
poking O
around O
the O
establishment, O
and O
for O
five O
minutes O
they O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
menu. O

That's O
enough O
to O
look O
back. O

It's O
a O
pretty O
good O
environment. B-TARGET

Surprisingly, O
the O
action O
2 O
at O
price O
1!!! O

But O
most O
important O
of O
all, O
it O
was O
delicious!!! O

Ordered O
spicy O
seafood B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
large O
portions, B-TARGET
sharp O
enough, O
liked O
it! O

The O
medias B-TARGET
under I-TARGET
the O
spice O
sauce, O
very O
good, O
reminiscent O
of O
two O
wands. O

Chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mashed I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful, O
soft O
and O
sufficient. O

I'm O
not O
gonna O
describe O
Sushi O
because O
he's O
different O
and O
he's O
an O
amateur. O

They O
liked O
the O
shrimp, O
the O
Philadelphia, B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
vegetables. O

The O
kitchen's B-TARGET
great, O
keep O
it O
up!!!!! O

There's O
a O
great O
desire O
to O
come O
back! O

Open O
one O
in O
the O
Lakes O
or O
somewhere O
in O
the O
North O
next O
door.)) O

Terrible O
service!!!! B-TARGET

So O
far, O
I've O
had O
a O
good O
impression O
of O
this O
bar, O
but O
the O
waiter O
we O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
a O
reservation O
with, O
he's O
been O
talking O
to O
me O
awful. O

Asked O
if O
they O
had O
non-smoking O
places, O
he O
said O
that O
if O
we O
needed O
non-smoking O
places, O
you O
would O
be O
in O
the O
cafe O
next O
to O
us, O
not O
us! O

And O
he O
withdrew, O
even O
though O
he O
and O
I O
had O
not O
yet O
finished O
our O
association!!! O

I'm O
never O
going O
there O
again! O

It's O
a O
terrible O
place!! B-TARGET

I O
read O
all O
the O
reviews O
downstairs O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
out O
there O
and O
eat O
with O
the O
girl. O

As O
it O
should O
be, O
I O
called, O
booked O
a O
table, O
asked O
for O
a O
cozy O
one O
on O
the O
first O
floor. O

Here O
we O
are. O

We've O
got O
the O
best O
table O
I've O
ever O
seen. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
great. O

Sit O
down. O

Sit... O
five O
more O
minutes... O

There's O
not O
even O
a O
menu. O

Got O
the O
waiter. O

They O
brought O
the O
menu. O
There's O
no O
ashtray. B-TARGET

In O
10 O
to O
15 O
minutes, O
they O
came O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
order O
(a O
different O
waiter). B-TARGET

Copy O
that, O
15 O
to O
20 O
minutes O
later. O

And... O

Missing... O

There O
wasn't O
an O
anchlag O
in O
the O
establishment, O
but O
there's O
a O
feeling O
that O
we O
didn't O
get O
any O
memory. O
The O
ashtray B-TARGET
(which O
we O
had O
to O
ask) O
was O
brought O
to O
us O
all O
night!!!!!!! O

Never O
changed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

All O
night O
long, O
they O
were O
playing O
the O
waiter's B-TARGET
game O
of O
Catch O
Me O
If O
You O
Can. O

And O
when O
she O
was O
able O
to O
call O
another O
waiter, B-TARGET
she O
turned O
down O
the O
order O
because O
we O
weren't O
her O
table. O

They O
asked O
for O
the O
bill, O
paid O
for O
it, O
and O
they O
don't O
pay O
back. O

I O
know O
that O
tips O
and O
all, O
but O
I O
want O
to O
determine O
their O
size O
myself. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
bring O
the O
change. O

Outcome. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
10 O
points. O

Kitchen's B-TARGET
seven O
points. O

Service B-TARGET
1 O
(or O
zero) O

Because O
of O
that, O
I'm O
not O
sure O
I'm O
going O
back O
there O
again. O
Our O
account O
for O
two O
of O
us O
was O
3,700 O
rubles. O

Recommendation: O
Teach O
the O
staff B-TARGET
to O
work O
normally O
at O
least! O

Last O
Sunday, O
they O
stopped O
by O
Metropol O
to O
celebrate O
the O
anniversary O
of O
the O
wedding O
quietly O
and O
quietly. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
surprise. O

Usually, O
before O
going O
to O
restaurants O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
I O
try O
to O
get O
to O
know O
them O
through O
websites, O
look O
at O
menus, O
so O
that O
I O
can O
understand O
where O
we're O
going O
and O
what O
to O
expect O
from O
both O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
price O
policy. O

So O
I O
was O
surprised O
at O
the O
first O
impression O
from O
the O
restaurant O
-- O
despite O
the O
rather O
democratic O
prices, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
perfect, O
it O
seemed O
expensive, O
perhaps O
even O
luxury... O

Well, O
I O
didn't O
expect O
it. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
thoughtful O
and O
polite, O
ranging O
from O
the O
hostess O
girl B-TARGET
downstairs O
to O
a O
few O
waiters. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

An B-TARGET
interesting, O
literate O
meal O
to O
eat) O

Tastes O
don't O
lag O
behind, O
e.g. O
digged B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
gofres, I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
caviar I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chanti I-TARGET
cream, O
fish B-TARGET
good O
(I O
don't O
know O
if O
they're O
salty O
or O
not), O
the O
combination O
of O
ingredients B-TARGET
is O
great. O

Beer's B-TARGET
good, O
I O
wouldn't O
say O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city, O
but O
at O
the O
level O
(my O
personal O
subjective O
opinion) O
with O
the O
best O
beer O
I've O
ever O
had O
in O
Peter... O

They O
even O
left O
a O
little O
review O
in O
the O
magic O
book. O

We'll O
go O
there O
again O
soon O
to O
get O
to O
know O
the O
menu O
more O
thoroughly) O

It's B-TARGET
a O
really O
good O
place. O

No O
big O
deal. O

It's O
cozy, O
it's O
quieter, B-TARGET
it's I-TARGET
got O
to O
rest. O

It's O
just O
like O
at O
the O
house. O

On O
the O
menu, O
the O
best O
truffle B-TARGET
butter I-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
ever. O

Salatikas B-TARGET
are O
almost O
nothing. O

Nice O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
blueberry. O

We O
were O
at O
the O
opening, O
and O
we O
saw O
this O
place. O

A O
couple O
of O
times, O
when O
there O
were O
very O
few O
people. O

You O
can O
put O
10 O
in O
this O
environment. O

And O
when O
Ivanushka's O
band O
came O
in O
tonight, O
that's O
where O
it O
got O
worse. O

The O
hall O
was O
full, O
but O
a O
couple O
of O
tables O
were O
empty, O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
couldn't O
handle O
it, O
served O
it O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

The O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
bad, O
the O
margarita B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
strawberry, I-TARGET
not O
strawberry, O
but O
syrup. O

For O
some O
reason, O
they O
included O
something O
we O
didn't O
order. O

But O
in O
principle, O
it O
didn't O
ruin O
our O
mood, O
because O
everyone O
saved O
Ivanushka. O

Outcome: O
We O
liked O
it. O

I'm O
sure O
I'll O
come O
back O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
myself. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
looks O
like O
you're O
coming O
to O
your O
friends' O
house O
because O
of O
your O
warm O
attitude, O
and O
maybe O
the O
chef. O

Looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday! O

The O
choice O
fell O
on O
Roll&Roll. O

It's O
the O
first O
time O
we've O
been O
here. O

Nice O
situation, B-TARGET
soft, O
cozy O
couches, B-TARGET
good O
lighting B-TARGET
(not O
bothering) O

The O
table O
was O
ordered O
Saturday O
morning O
for O
the O
evening. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
advised O
you O
to O
pre-order, O
told O
me O
the O
menu, O
advised O
the O
food. O

It's O
nice. O

The B-TARGET
blues I-TARGET
were O
cooked O
deliciously. O

It O
was B-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
time. I-TARGET

Anyway, O
the O
guys O
loved O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
great. O

Andrei O
served O
us, O
thank O
you O
very O
much, O
didn't O
have O
to O
look O
for O
him O
and O
look O
for O
him. O

I O
was O
kind O
of O
surprised O
by O
the O
money, O
not O
so O
expensive. O

You'll O
have O
to O
judge O
six O
people O
at O
7,500p. O

Nice O
place. B-TARGET

Nice O
kitchen. B-TARGET

My O
husband O
works O
next O
door. O
I O
thought O
I'd O
come O
by O
to O
celebrate O
my O
own O
little O
party. O

A O
nice O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
light O
in O
the O
shower O
and O
cozy. O

Well O
done, O
10! O
The O
service B-TARGET
is O
the O
nicest O
waitress B-TARGET
(in O
my O
opinion, O
Elphira) O
is O
a O
beautiful O
girl, O
considerate, O
even O
at O
my O
request, O
the O
scissors O
were O
brought O
right O
away, O
clean O
tablecloths, B-TARGET
a O
change B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
instruments, I-TARGET
a O
very O
beautiful O
collection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

It's O
a O
shame O
there's O
no O
ovine B-TARGET
barbecue-- I-TARGET
but O
it's O
only O
open, O
I O
think O
the O
menu O
is O
going O
to O
grow! O
And O
out O
of O
pork, B-TARGET
I O
tried O
a O
piece O
of O
pork-- O
tenderly, O
juicely, O
for O
a O
hundred O
years, O
I O
haven't O
eaten O
anything O
like O
that O
and O
not O
dried O
up O
as O
usual))) O
the O
Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
is O
the O
most O
delicious O
option O
I've O
ever O
had O
in O
my O
life O
(where O
I've O
never O
tried O
Caesar!) O
and O
the O
very O
tasty O
swath B-TARGET
of O
all O
the O
things O
we've O
ordered, O
and O
the O
husband O
and O
I O
are O
both O
very O
picky O
in O
food. O

I'd O
like O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
this O
restaurant O
doesn't O
degenerate. O

When O
we O
left, O
we O
got O
a O
map. O

Just O
so O
the O
cards O
don't O
get O
picked O
up-- O
wait O
for O
more O
and O
more! O

We O
celebrated O
a O
wedding O
party O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
05.08.2010. O

It's O
a O
very O
nice, O
comfortable O
and O
calm O
environment. B-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
really O
family. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
paying O
attention, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
super!!!!! O

All O
wishes O
are O
taken O
into O
account!!!! O

They're O
cooking O
great! O

It's O
really O
good, O
it's O
all O
good, O
it's O
good O
to O
cook O
meat!!! B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
left O
a O
great O
impression!!!!!!! O

They O
were O
at O
the O
restaurant O
on O
April O
26. O

The O
situation B-TARGET
is O
very O
comfortable. O

I O
liked O
the O
audience B-TARGET
there. O

And O
foreigners O
and O
students O
were O
sitting. O

Different O
people.. O
and O
everyone O
was O
given O
a O
good O
reception. B-TARGET

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
sounds O
and O
looks. O

When O
we O
tried O
to O
make O
sure. O

Ely O
hachapuri. O
Cheese O
slugs, O
pork O
and O
seafood O
salad. O

It's O
all O
good. O

I O
liked O
hachapuri O
better O
with B-TARGET
cheese. I-TARGET

Is O
it O
that O
you O
were O
hungry O
or O
that O
it O
really O
tastes O
good... O

They O
drank O
Georgian O
wine. O

It's O
pretty O
good, O
too. O

The O
average O
score O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
decent, O
but O
only O
because O
of O
wine. O

I O
think O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
decent O
and O
cheap. O

The O
background O
music O
is O
playing. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
polite O
and O
friendly. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
romantic. O

They O
cook O
well. O

I O
agree O
with O
previous O
reviews: O
Tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
to O
each O
other. O

For O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
a O
hotel, O
I O
think O
he's O
too O
dark O
and O
dark O
from O
the O
inside, O
well O
on O
the O
street, O
wooden B-TARGET
tables I-TARGET
and O
chairs B-TARGET
under I-TARGET
umbrellas, I-TARGET
fresh B-TARGET
air I-TARGET
-- O
that's O
where O
we O
set O
up. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
clearly O
don't O
understand O
their O
purpose, O
no O
smiles, O
no O
sparks O
in O
their O
eyes, O
no O
advice O
on O
their O
choice O
of O
food. O

It O
felt O
like O
they O
weren't O
happy O
we O
were O
here O
at O
all. O

All O
right, O
I'm O
gonna O
ask O
you O
about O
the O
barbecue, O
"How O
long O
is O
it O
gonna O
be?" O
says, O
"No, O
people O
don't, O
not O
much, O
not O
long." O
Order. O

I O
shouldn't O
have O
lied O
to O
you O
about O
an O
hour, O
if O
not O
more. O

My O
friends O
have O
heard O
that O
the O
barbecue O
is O
delicious. O

I O
didn't O
like O
it O
at O
all, O
dry O
meat, B-TARGET
but O
red B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

The O
cold B-TARGET
"Lapin I-TARGET
Kulta" I-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
was O
also O
a O
joy. O

Other O
than O
that, O
he O
didn't O
like O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
some O
"cheese," O
he O
was O
missing O
something, O
and O
the O
ship B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
platter O
wasn't O
what O
he O
wanted. O

The O
wine O
is O
cold, O
they O
say O
it's O
almost O
coming O
from O
under O
the O
heater. O

Ice B-TARGET
cream O
and O
green B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lemon... I-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
isn't O
very O
obsessive. O

They O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant O
and O
then O
they O
go O
out O
and O
see O
if O
anyone O
needs O
anything. O

We O
were O
gonna O
ask O
for O
the O
bill, O
and O
we O
thought O
they O
might O
be O
back O
there O
by O
now. O
)) O

But O
we O
did O
have O
a O
good O
time, O
'cause O
the O
most O
important O
company! O

We O
were O
a O
big O
company O
at O
your O
restaurant, O
celebrating O
your O
birthday!!!!!!! O

I O
really O
liked O
your O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice! O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
everything O
was O
on O
the O
level, O
delicious O
dishes!!!! B-TARGET

Very O
good O
music, B-TARGET
I O
think O
it's O
the O
kind O
of O
music O
that O
fits O
everyone, O
and O
a O
comfortable O
environment B-TARGET
helps O
to O
stay O
a O
little O
longer, O
especially O
if O
there's O
still O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

I'll O
mark O
the O
service B-TARGET
at O
a O
good O
level, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
our O
waiter B-TARGET
Wusal!!!!! O

Next O
birthday O
is O
for O
you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

O

First, O
I O
write O
a O
review O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
because O
it's O
impossible O
to O
write. O

The O
wedding O
was O
celebrated O
on O
August O
17 O
by O
45 O
people. O

We O
and O
our O
guests O
were O
thrilled O
about O
everything. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
varied, O
a O
service B-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level! O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
food, B-TARGET
by O
the O
way, O
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
we O
had O
the O
rest O
wrapped O
up O
with O
us. O

But O
even O
more O
than O
that, O
we O
enjoyed O
serving B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
waiters, I-TARGET
they O
were O
very O
thoughtful O
and O
polite! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
waiter B-TARGET
Vladimir O
for O
his O
patience O
and O
care O
in O
serving O
our O
elderly O
relatives. O

They O
still O
remember O
you O
in O
good O
words!!!! O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
party! O

I'll O
be O
sure O
to O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
I O
know! O

I O
really O
like O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Like O
many O
years O
ago, O
a O
high-level O
service. B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
so O
smiley O
and O
considerate, O
they'll O
always O
know O
if O
they O
like O
it, O
if O
you O
need O
anything O
else, O
and O
if O
you O
ask O
me, O
I'll O
recommend O
something. O

I'm O
quick O
and O
non-intrusive. O

The O
interior, B-TARGET
of O
course O
for O
an O
amateur, O
doesn't O
really O
taste O
like O
me, O
I O
like O
more O
comfortable O
places. O

But O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
really O
good, O
and O
for O
this O
wonderful O
service B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
I'm O
ready O
to O
come O
back O
again O
and O
again. O

Last O
time O
I O
took O
a O
salad O
with O
mozzarella O
and O
hamon. O

It's O
a O
delicious O
salad. B-TARGET

And O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
is O
gonna O
lick O
your O
fingers. O

Cheese O
is O
roasted O
in O
sesame, O
and O
tender O
chicken B-TARGET
meat O
is O
an O
excellent O
complement O
to O
sweet O
orange B-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

I O
highly O
recommend O
it. O

A O
friend O
ordered O
veal B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
a O
bone O
and O
stayed O
very O
happy O
too. O

I O
recommend O
Las O
Torres' O
restaurant, B-TARGET
a O
really O
beautiful O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
have O
a O
really O
good O
dinner O
and O
have O
a O
good O
time. O

The O
only O
place B-TARGET
close O
to O
the O
house O
that O
works O
until O
6:00 O
a.m. O
and O
doesn't O
have O
to O
drive. O

There's O
a O
separate O
room B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
non-smokers. I-TARGET

Lots O
of O
tables B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
couchs. I-TARGET

They O
always O
meet O
you, O
they O
walk O
you O
to O
the O
table. O

They O
advise O
you O
when O
you O
pick O
a O
meal. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
stock, O
like O
up O
to O
6:00 O
a.m., O
two O
meals O
at O
1. O

There's O
also O
an O
Italian O
menu O
right O
now, O
but O
they O
haven't O
risked O
it O
yet. O

The O
only O
minus O
can O
bring O
both O
soup O
and O
rolls, O
if O
the O
rolls O
are O
hot, O
they O
can O
cool O
off. O

9 O
times O
out O
of O
10 O
is O
good. O

The O
delivery B-TARGET
wasn't O
bad O
either, O
it O
never O
happened O
that O
something O
wasn't O
reported O
or O
wrong. O

They O
always O
bring O
you O
in O
at O
the O
scheduled O
time. O

In O
general, O
in O
our O
neighborhood, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
decent O
places. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

Sitting O
there O
with O
a O
young O
man, O
taking O
a O
pizza O
for O
two. O

I O
don't O
remember O
the O
name, O
but O
I O
remember O
the O
mushroom. O

I'm O
happy O
with O
the O
tasty O
and O
dough, B-TARGET
as O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
said O
correctly, O
not O
the O
thin, O
not O
the O
fat, O
but O
the O
right O
time! O
The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
tasty, O
very O
well O
felt O
the O
white O
mushrooms, O
but O
it O
seemed O
a O
little O
fresh, O
so O
9. O

The O
design B-TARGET
is O
very O
well, O
fairly O
bright O
for O
nonsmokers O
and O
darker O
for O
smokers. O

We O
sat O
in O
a O
non-smoking O
window, O
very O
cozy, O
and O
the O
light O
tone B-TARGET
of O
the O
hall O
cheers O
up O
the O
mood. O

I've O
seen O
bad O
staff O
reviews... O

On O
the O
contrary, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
commend O
you. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
was O
a O
very O
nice O
girl, O
a O
nice O
face, O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
came O
up O
fast, O
told O
me O
on O
the O
menu. O

Anyway, O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
restaurant! B-TARGET

And O
for O
those O
who O
have O
not O
tasted O
the O
lovely O
drink O
of O
Limoncello, B-TARGET
I O
advise O
you O
to O
try! O

I O
was O
thrilled, O
I O
really O
tried O
cream B-TARGET
lemonchelo. I-TARGET

It's O
worth O
140 O
rubles O
in O
50 O
years O
in O
a O
restaurant, O
which O
is O
an O
acceptable O
price O
for O
this O
drink! B-TARGET

Thank O
you! O

Long O
thought O
of O
where O
to O
go O
to O
celebrate O
the O
anniversary O
of O
the O
husband's O
parents. O

I O
wanted O
seafood, O
an O
interesting O
new O
interior. O

Of O
all O
the O
(not O
very O
large) O
lists O
of O
new O
establishments O
of O
this O
kind, O
a O
restaurant O
called O
"Massmidia" O
has O
been O
chosen, O
and O
I O
love O
seafood, O
but O
unfortunately, O
we O
don't O
have O
many O
places O
to O
offer O
such O
diversity O
to O
Midian. O

And O
mostly, O
they've O
all O
been O
flattened O
up O
and O
down. O

My O
husband's O
parents O
are O
very O
fond O
of O
Morefood. O

So O
the O
main O
thing O
was O
for O
us O
to O
keep O
them O
happy. O

And O
we O
(and O
the O
staff O
of O
the O
restaurant) B-TARGET
succeeded) O

A O
great O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
nice O
staff B-TARGET
have O
created O
a O
great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
for O
our O
little O
family O
holiday. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
friend O
at O
this O
beautiful O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
June O
10th, O
my O
birthday! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful!! O

That's O
great!!!!! O

Amazing O
ceilings B-TARGET
in O
the O
unsmoking O
room... O
comfortable O
sofas B-TARGET
in O
the O
light O
room... O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Magnificent O
crab B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
duck I-TARGET
salads... I-TARGET

An O
interesting O
combination O
of O
crab B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
pears... I-TARGET

And O
an O
unusual O
dig-up O
duck O
and O
celery... O

A O
very O
tasty O
hot B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
- O
Dorado B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables!!! I-TARGET

I O
advise O
all O
those O
who O
love O
fish!!!!!! B-TARGET

And O
in O
the O
conclusion O
of O
our O
dessert O
meal... O

fresh O
strawberry O
soup!!!! O

REALLY!!!!!!! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
beautiful. O

We O
were O
met O
by O
a O
girl O
with O
big O
eyes O
and O
a O
beautiful O
dress. O

Very O
nice O
and O
kind O
to O
us, O
sat O
us O
down O
at O
the O
couch O
table, O
brought O
us O
water, O
helped O
us O
choose O
wine... O

Everything O
is O
very O
non-intrusive O
and O
professional! O

In O
general, O
the O
most O
pleasant... O

It O
was O
great!! O

Let's O
go O
back O
to O
this O
amazing O
place B-TARGET
more O
than O
once... O

They O
celebrated O
their O
birthday O
with O
a O
small O
company O
the O
other O
day. O

LIKE O
everything, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
non-addictive, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
in O
white, O
who O
served O
us, O
very O
thoughtfully, O
counseled O
with O
what O
sauce, O
offered O
tea, O
warned O
us O
that O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
big O
(so O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
we O
didn't O
even O
make O
it O
work). O

I've O
seen O
the O
owner O
walk O
through O
the O
restaurant, O
see O
if O
the O
guests O
are O
happy. O

There O
were O
a O
few O
other O
companies O
besides O
us. O

The O
rice B-TARGET
was O
well O
made, O
the O
eggplants B-TARGET
too, O
everything O
fixed, O
nothing O
beyond O
spicy O
or O
salty. O

Cheese B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
is O
hot O
like O
a O
stove! O

There's O
no O
one O
above O
us, O
what's O
called, O
not O
standing, O
not O
getting O
the O
plates O
out O
of O
our O
hands) O

We've O
been O
sitting O
around O
for O
quite O
a O
while, O
no O
one's O
rushing O
us O
anywhere. O

I O
wanted O
to O
try O
the O
Indian O
Cheesecake O
dessert, O
but O
it O
didn't O
fit, O
so O
I'll O
leave O
it O
for O
the O
next O
time. O

The O
impressions O
are O
very O
nice! O

I O
was O
on O
my O
way O
to O
work, O
looking O
out O
the O
window, O
shops, O
intersections, O
park... O
I O
see O
a O
sign... O
we O
opened O
up O
or O
something. O

I O
kept O
my O
eye O
on O
it, O
it O
turned O
out O
the O
Palky B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
was O
open O
in O
Japanese O
and O
Italian, O
so O
I O
guess O
I'd O
rather O
not O
come O
by. O

First O
of O
all, O
no O
one's O
met, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
be O
on O
the O
ground O
myself. O

The O
restaurant O
room O
was O
empty, O
there O
were O
no O
guests. O

Picked O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window, O
sat O
down, O
waiting O
for O
the O
menu. O

They O
noticed O
me O
pretty O
quickly, O
and O
with O
a O
smile O
all O
over O
my O
mouth... O
no... O
they O
didn't O
send O
me O
a O
menu, O
they O
asked O
me O
to O
move, O
because O
this O
table O
was O
for O
big O
companies O
(at O
one O
o'clock O
on O
the O
day), O
well, O
come O
on. O

Second O
of O
all, O
I O
didn't O
make O
the O
choice, O
ordered O
it O
myself. O

And O
I O
ordered O
the O
salmon O
paste, O
the O
Greek O
salad, O
and O
the O
cocktail. O

Third, O
both O
served O
at O
the O
same O
time O
without O
asking O
me! O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
wasn't O
tasty O
and O
salty, O
lettuce B-TARGET
wasn't O
good O
enough. O

Music B-TARGET
is O
incomprehensible O
and O
sedentary, O
uncomfortable O
furniture, B-TARGET
and O
ashtrays B-TARGET
need O
to O
be O
asked. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
the O
punters O
need O
to O
be O
renamed O
the O
cafeteria, O
because O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
far O
away O
and O
can't O
even O
be O
seen, O
either O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of O
the O
service, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
halls O
and, O
of O
course, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
cooking O
and O
serving O
of O
the O
ITALYAN B-TARGET
kitchen. I-TARGET

I'm O
joining O
the O
positive O
reviews. O

It's O
not O
a O
restaurant O
in O
the O
full O
sense O
of O
the O
word, O
but O
it's O
a O
great O
cafe B-TARGET
with O
delicious O
kitchens B-TARGET
and O
moderate O
prices. O

The O
numbers B-TARGET
are O
big, O
the O
first O
time O
they're O
supposed O
to O
be O
salad, O
the O
first, O
the O
second O
and O
the O
compote O
barely O
crawled O
out O
of O
the O
table. O

Big O
choice O
of O
second B-TARGET
course, O
tasty O
soup, B-TARGET
baked, B-TARGET
too. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
consistent O
with O
the O
status, O
the O
only O
minus-- O
really, O
it's O
not O
clear O
which O
one O
of O
the O
non-smoker B-TARGET
rooms, I-TARGET
whether O
there's O
smoke O
everywhere, O
or O
whether O
the B-TARGET
extraction I-TARGET
doesn't O
work O
well. O

Anyway, O
we O
went O
there O
for O
lunch O
once O
a O
week O
when O
we O
went O
to O
work O
in O
those O
parts. O

And O
we've O
noticed O
that O
we're O
looking O
forward O
to O
this O
very O
day! O

The O
restaurant O
wasn't O
big, O
the O
environment O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
there O
were O
regular O
customers) O

The B-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
made O
wonderful O
desserts B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
Tiramisa I-TARGET
) O
) O
) O
) O
) O
))) O

I O
suggest!! O
all O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
served O
on O
large O
and O
heavy O
plates B-TARGET
of O
non-conventional O
shape. O
) O
) O
) O
) O
)) O

This O
restaurant O
was O
the O
first O
in O
dozens O
of O
top O
Japanese, O
but O
I O
ate O
more O
sushi. O

They're O
big O
and O
juicy, O
but O
they're O
just O
like O
everything O
else O
and O
everywhere, O
and O
there's O
almost O
no O
choice. O

The O
menu O
has O
no O
pictures, O
and O
everyone's O
so O
used O
to O
picking O
food O
from O
them. O
) O
) O
) O
) O
) O

It's O
so O
quiet O
and O
cozy. O

Well, O
this O
place O
is O
more O
of O
a O
thematic O
cafe O
than O
a O
restaurant. O

It's B-TARGET
not O
very O
big, O
but O
when O
people O
aren't O
very O
good O
at O
it. O

There O
are O
no O
separate O
areas B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
smokers I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
nonsmokers. I-TARGET

In O
general, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
inexpensive O
but O
interesting. O

It's O
been O
a O
pleasure O
to O
have O
a O
menu B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
forelock, O
the O
theme B-TARGET
clothes I-TARGET
of O
the O
employees/music. B-TARGET

A O
girl O
from O
our O
humble O
company O
got O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
glass O
of O
wine. B-TARGET

Services B-TARGET
are O
generally O
fast O
and O
of O
good O
quality. O

In O
principle, O
we O
didn't O
order O
much, O
but O
from O
what O
we O
ordered, O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
fresh, O
quality. O

Plus, O
it's O
quite O
understandable. O
(I'd O
say O
a O
little O
bit O
on O
the O
house, O
without O
any O
pejon O
delicacies.) O

The O
price O
in O
this O
institution O
is O
democratic: O
a O
pot O
of O
salts O
of O
200 O
p.p., O
a O
burner O
of O
Nemirov-80 O
p. O
8000r., O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
(I O
don't O
remember) O
of O
150 O
p.p., O
a O
lighter O
of O
Kent-100 O
p.p., O
a O
beer B-TARGET
(some O
spilled O
fucking, O
tasty, O
but) O
150 O
p. O
(a O
bottle O
of O
130), O
a O
total O
alcohol O
bill O
of O
1,470 O
p.+chai. O

It's O
a O
shame O
I O
don't O
get O
to O
be O
in O
this O
neighborhood O
very O
often, O
so O
next O
time O
it's O
not O
gonna O
be O
too O
soon, O
and O
I O
think O
I've O
been O
to O
this O
place O
so O
out O
of O
line. O

On O
April O
29, O
they O
celebrated O
a O
wedding O
in O
Amulet. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
made O
us O
and O
our O
guests O
very O
happy. O

Everything O
was O
really O
great, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
menu O
was O
1,500 O
per O
person, O
everyone O
had O
enough, O
everything O
we O
had O
left O
was O
packed. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
hot O
appetizer-- O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
tempura, O
and O
the O
hot O
main O
dish O
makes O
me O
want O
to O
celebrate O
veal B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushroom I-TARGET
sauce-- I-TARGET
very O
gentle O
and O
tasty! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
great, O
the O
waitresses' B-TARGET
girls I-TARGET
were O
good O
after O
the O
party, O
helping O
to O
pack O
not O
only O
food O
but O
all O
the O
flowers O
they O
gave O
us! O

The O
new O
hall B-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful O
- O
light, O
plenty O
of O
room, O
chandeliers B-TARGET
are O
awesome! O

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
of O
Liliana O
and O
the O
entire O
restaurant B-TARGET
team. I-TARGET
Great O
place! O
Next O
time O
we O
know O
where O
we're O
going O
and O
which O
restaurant B-TARGET
we're O
gonna O
recommend O
to O
friends. O

Sergei O
and O
Vera O
Hmelkova O

I O
had O
lunch O
at O
Amici O
a O
few O
times. O

And O
every O
time O
she O
left, O
she O
was O
happy!) O

It's O
hard O
to O
call O
a O
restaurant, O
but O
I O
think O
it's O
more O
of O
a O
cafe O
than O
a O
place, O
more O
like O
a O
cozy, O
small O
corner O
of O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine!!! I-TARGET

Warm O
light O
tones, B-TARGET
cozy O
couchs, B-TARGET
noble O
old O
chairs B-TARGET
make O
comforts, O
good O
strings, B-TARGET
instruments, B-TARGET
everything's O
fine. O

Decent O
service. B-TARGET

But O
of O
course, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
the O
main O
plus. O

I've O
been O
to O
a O
few O
business O
lunches, O
salad, O
soup, O
hot O
drinks, O
and O
there O
are O
a O
few O
options O
for O
each O
position. B-TARGET

I O
would O
particularly O
like O
to O
note O
the B-TARGET
waiter's I-TARGET
help O
in O
choosing O
for O
me O
and O
replacing O
some O
vegetarian O
foods O
(I O
don't O
eat O
meat). O

I've O
tried O
pasta, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
now, O
but O
it's O
one O
of O
the O
best O
ones O
I've O
ever O
tried! O

In O
the O
nearest O
neighbourhood, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
for O
me!!! O

27.11 O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
at O
the O
Saltan O
restaurant O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
of O
the O
hall O
where O
aquariums O
and O
live O
music O
are. O

I O
and O
all O
my O
guests, O
and O
there O
were O
11 O
of O
them, O
enjoyed O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
unanimously. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
the O
smart-ass O
administrator B-TARGET
are O
doing O
their O
job O
at O
100. O

It's O
really O
good O
food, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
it's O
great O
music, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
show B-TARGET
program. I-TARGET

The O
abdomen B-TARGET
dance I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Our O
company O
has O
remained O
pleased O
with O
the O
reception, B-TARGET
and O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
to O
celebrate O
more O
than O
once O
and O
just O
have O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We'll O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
someone O
we O
know. O

With O
respect, O
Natalia. O

I'd O
like O
to O
share O
my O
impressions O
of O
visiting O
this O
newly O
opened O
restaurant O
on O
my O
favorite O
restaurant O
street, O
Rubinstein. O

Visited O
him O
twice O
a O
day O
for O
business O
lunch. O

So, O
the O
first O
visit, O
at O
the O
entrance, O
was O
politely O
met, O
planted, O
quickly O
served, O
and O
there O
were O
only O
two O
questions O
about O
the O
food: O
it O
was O
salted O
spinach B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
and O
there O
was O
no O
bread, O
and O
so O
the O
salad B-TARGET
and O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
cutter I-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

And O
the O
second O
time O
I O
had O
a O
business O
meeting O
during O
a O
business O
lunch, O
I O
had O
an O
unexpected O
disappointment. O

And O
it O
wasn't O
exactly O
what O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be. O

After O
ordering O
an O
aperitive O
glass O
of O
white B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
she O
got O
it O
warm O
and O
uncooled, O
and O
my O
glass O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
fridge... O
someone O
drank, O
and O
I O
waited O
for O
my O
glass, O
and O
I O
asked O
for O
a O
bread O
plate O
for O
a O
business O
lunch, O
and O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
said O
that O
we O
would O
get O
a O
bruskets O
as O
a O
bonus O
for O
a O
wine O
order O
and O
we O
would O
wait... O
but O
by O
then O
the O
booked O
borsk, B-TARGET
which, O
by O
the O
way, O
was O
untasteful. O

But O
here's O
the O
hot B-TARGET
and O
dessert. B-TARGET
We O
ordered O
the O
panakota. B-TARGET
We O
were O
good, O
and O
the O
bruskets B-TARGET
were O
good, O
too. O

And O
everything O
was O
polite O
and O
careful. O

So O
it's O
not O
exactly O
bad, O
but O
it's O
not O
good O
enough O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
like O
this. O

But O
God O
loves O
the O
trinity, O
I'll O
come O
back O
again, O
maybe O
give O
you O
some O
credit. O

It O
was O
Peter's O
birthday O
at O
the O
restaurant O
on O
April O
5. O

From O
the O
very O
first O
moment, O
we O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
very O
kind O
waiters, B-TARGET
bartenders, B-TARGET
and O
I O
would O
like O
to O
pay O
special O
tribute O
to O
Administrator B-TARGET
Elena! O

We O
were O
offered O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
or O
coffee O
(at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
establishment), B-TARGET
which O
is O
not O
all O
the O
restaurants B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
city O
offer! O

The O
guests O
at O
the O
event O
were O
about O
30 O
people, O
and O
Elena O
explained O
to O
us O
very O
easily O
what's O
on O
the O
feast O
menu, O
what's O
worth O
putting O
on O
the O
table O
and O
what's O
left O
out. O

It O
also O
helped O
us O
to O
calculate O
the O
amount O
and O
amount O
of O
alcohol O
we O
need O
to O
buy O
at O
our O
event! O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
feast, O
from O
the O
first O
second O
at O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
mood O
of O
the O
party O
was O
felt O
by O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
smiling O
and O
congratulating! O
It O
was O
very O
nice! O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
celebration O
of O
the O
soul O
and O
stomach!!!!!! O

I O
advise O
everyone O
who O
wasn't O
there O
to O
come O
in, O
and O
whoever O
was, O
I O
think O
we O
should O
do O
it O
again! O

I've O
become O
a O
regular O
myself... O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
get O
to O
the O
center, O
I O
always O
come O
in O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee... O

In O
general, O
I O
advise O
you O
all!! O

I've O
been O
celebrating O
my O
birthday O
with O
my O
friends. O

We O
were O
here O
in O
the O
first O
place. O

It's O
been O
a O
great O
night. O

An O
interior-style, B-TARGET
polite O
fast O
waiters, B-TARGET
and O
a O
terrific O
kitchen. B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
really O
above O
praise! O

It's O
delicious, O
it's O
well O
cooked, O
it's O
well O
served. O

It's O
very O
cozy O
and O
comfortable. O

I'd O
like O
to O
thank O
you O
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone! O

p.s. O
Thank O
you O
very O
much, O
girls. O

We O
went O
to O
Malevich O
with O
our O
friends. O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
and O
bad O
rumors, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
check O
it O
out O
ourselves. O

He O
throws O
himself O
into O
the O
galaxy, O
the O
entrance, B-TARGET
everything's O
beautiful, O
it's O
a O
pleasure. O

Inside, O
design, B-TARGET
"stained O
to O
a O
hole," O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
weren't O
in O
the O
room O
at O
all, O
the O
bartender O
was O
sitting O
behind O
the O
counter O
reading O
a O
book, O
apparently O
clients O
come O
here O
only O
on O
weekends. O

Sit O
down, O
the O
ashtray B-TARGET
was, O
for O
some O
reason, O
almost O
full. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
clearly O
couldn't O
explain O
what O
was O
on O
the O
menu, O
so O
they O
ordered O
everything O
they O
already O
knew. O

Twenty-five O
minutes O
of O
cooking, O
for O
an O
empty O
place, O
I O
think O
it's O
a O
long O
time. O

In O
general, O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

The O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
but O
prices O
should O
be O
better. O

The O
cocktails O
are O
a O
lot, O
but O
they're O
expensive O
enough O
for O
a O
new O
place, O
Daikiri O
290r, O
usually O
new O
places, O
usually O
don't O
hold O
high O
prices O
for O
a O
while, O
but O
it's O
expensive. O

So O
let's O
just O
sum O
up, O
service B-TARGET
three, O
kitchen B-TARGET
four, O
more O
like O
four, O
design B-TARGET
four, O
all O
beautiful, O
but O
cliché, O
missing O
some O
kind O
of O
raisins. O

The O
middle O
place, B-TARGET
it O
might O
get O
better, O
it O
might O
get O
worse O
until O
it's O
clear. O

I O
accidentally O
saw O
this O
restaurant O
on O
Restoklab, O
decided O
to O
come O
over O
for O
lunch O
with O
a O
friend, O
decided O
to O
try O
the O
local O
lunch. O

The O
choice O
is O
very O
good O
at O
a O
relatively O
low O
price O
(such O
as O
330 O
rubles O
for O
drinks). O

So O
my O
choice O
fell O
on O
a O
salad O
with O
red O
fish O
and O
vegetables, O
filled O
with O
mayonnaise O
(the O
fish B-TARGET
in O
the O
salad O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
tasty, O
a O
small O
portion), B-TARGET
a O
champagne O
soup O
made O
of O
champagne O
with O
crackers O
(the O
soup B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
only O
minus-- O
I'd O
serve O
it B-TARGET
separately, O
I O
wouldn't O
like O
it O
when O
it O
became O
soft O
and O
salted O
less), O
baked O
pork O
with O
mushrooms O
and O
potatoes O
(the O
pork B-TARGET
pork O
juice, O
the O
seed O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
dry, O
to O
this O
dish O
I'd O
add O
some O
sauce, O
I'd O
like O
to O
eat B-TARGET
it O
- O
on O
a B-TARGET
pan). I-TARGET

My O
friend O
was O
in O
solidarity O
with O
me O
in O
everything O
but O
a O
hot O
meal. O

Her O
choice O
fell O
on O
grilled O
chicken O
breasts O
+ O
pepper O
beans O
in O
tomato O
sauce O
(the O
breasts B-TARGET
were O
dry O
and O
the O
garrison B-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
liked). O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
non-addictive. O

There's O
a O
nice O
man B-TARGET
standing O
at O
the O
entrance: O
polite, O
nice. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
normal, O
in O
principle, O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
for O
dinners, O
but O
no O
more. O

I O
can O
write O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
forever, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
come O
over O
and O
over O
again, O
no O
matter O
who, O
when O
or O
what. O

Winter O
Leto, O
it's O
like O
a O
magnet O
to O
me. O

The O
afternoons O
are O
nice O
dinners, O
the O
evenings O
are O
delicious O
dinners, B-TARGET
smooth-flowing O
nights, O
karaoke O
and O
dancing. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
really O
likes O
it, O
but O
it's O
a O
long O
time O
to O
renovate, O
and O
I O
think O
most O
of O
the O
visitors O
would O
be O
in O
favour O
of O
this O
idea, O
even O
though O
the O
old O
interior, B-TARGET
a O
little O
scrambled O
furniture, B-TARGET
isn't O
preventing O
us O
from O
coming O
here O
again O
and O
again, O
because O
the O
main O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

Zima O
Leto's O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
good: O
a O
good O
and O
delicious O
grill B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
(especially O
fish), B-TARGET
a O
standard O
choice O
of O
salads, B-TARGET
a O
large O
choice O
of O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
(the O
most O
tasty O
Geisha B-TARGET
and O
kyoto B-TARGET
baked), O
a O
decent O
cock B-TARGET
card, I-TARGET
but O
a O
long O
one, O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
and O
strawberry B-TARGET
margaritas I-TARGET
do O
not O
advise O
anyone, O
disgusting! O

But O
it O
doesn't O
have O
to O
be O
perfect!! O

I O
only O
smoke O
kalyan B-TARGET
here, O
I O
think O
he's O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
town O
here. O

The O
only O
downside O
of O
this O
place O
is O
service: B-TARGET
girls B-TARGET
with O
missing O
eyes, O
pretend O
to O
be O
the O
owners O
of O
the O
place, O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
a O
lot, O
and O
it's O
not O
good O
enough. O

You O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
this O
weekend, O
especially O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night, O
and O
if O
you're O
gonna O
take O
a O
part O
of O
it, O
you're O
gonna O
have O
to O
wait O
till O
morning. O

I O
still O
thank O
my O
friend O
for O
opening O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
me O
a O
year O
ago. O

Since O
then, O
every O
trip O
to O
Wave B-TARGET
has O
made O
me O
feel O
good. O

Before O
I O
move O
on O
to O
the O
most O
important O
kitchen, O
I'll O
say O
a O
few O
words O
about O
the O
interior, O
the O
service, O
and O
the O
restaurant O
in O
general. O

There O
is O
always O
a O
pleasant O
and O
friendly O
atmosphere: B-TARGET
friendly O
girls B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
hostess, I-TARGET
helpful O
waiters B-TARGET
(but O
sometimes O
not O
very O
much), O
soft O
leather O
couchs, B-TARGET
paintings O
of O
contemporary O
artists O
on O
the O
market. O

The O
wave B-TARGET
is O
a O
place O
where, O
on O
a O
dayday, O
it's O
very O
easy O
to O
hide O
from O
urban O
noise O
and O
fuss. O

But O
it O
wouldn't O
matter O
if O
it O
wasn't O
for O
a O
great O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Cesari B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
ever O
tasted, O
the O
Greek B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
really O
surprised O
me, O
didn't O
think O
what O
a O
"eaten" O
dish O
was O
for O
me O
could O
be O
so O
delicious. O

Fetuccini B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
just O
melt O
in O
their O
mouth, O
crab B-TARGET
paste I-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
I'd O
add O
a O
little O
more O
sauce O
to O
make O
it O
taste O
softer. O

Sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls... B-TARGET
it's O
a O
separate O
subject, O
to O
me, O
so O
the O
best O
in O
town, O
no O
Ginsa O
can O
compare. O

And O
they're O
delicious, O
all O
of O
them, O
all O
of O
them, O
all O
of O
them, O
all O
of O
them, O
the O
kyoto B-TARGET
roll, O
the O
hot B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
roll. I-TARGET

As O
far O
as O
desserts O
are O
concerned, O
I'm O
more O
than O
comfortable O
with O
them, O
but O
Napoleon's B-TARGET
cake O
and O
Philadelphia B-TARGET
cheesecake, I-TARGET
fruit B-TARGET
tartar I-TARGET
has O
changed O
my O
attitude O
towards O
desserts. O

We O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
with O
our O
wife O
the O
anniversary O
of O
our O
wedding O
in O
Shaba-Shaba. O

When O
we O
arrived, O
there O
were O
hardly O
any O
visitors, O
and O
we O
sat O
in O
a O
small O
room. O

It O
was O
quiet O
and O
quiet O
until O
the O
company O
of O
four O
arrived. O

They O
seemed O
to O
sit O
at O
our O
table, O
so O
little O
room. O

This O
room O
shouldn't O
have O
had O
four O
tables, O
it O
should O
have O
had O
two. O

We O
really O
liked O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
in O
this O
place. O

All O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
made O
of O
freshest O
food. B-TARGET

The O
eel B-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
were O
the O
most O
impressive, O
and O
next O
time O
we O
try O
others. O

And O
we O
also O
ordered O
Shaba-Shabu's O
specialty. O

The O
most O
delicious O
ingredient B-TARGET
is O
marble B-TARGET
meat, I-TARGET
you're O
just O
gonna O
lick O
your O
fingers. O

The O
broth B-TARGET
was O
just O
a O
little O
salty. O

The O
impressions O
are O
the O
nicest, O
we'll O
come O
in O
again. O

After O
attending O
the O
theater, O
they O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
dinner O
at O
the O
living O
room O
restaurant O
with O
their O
husband O
and O
friends. O

The O
husband O
was O
ordered O
by O
Gazpacho O
and O
Soljanka, O
a O
hot O
dish O
of O
tobacco O
with O
grilled O
vegetables O
and O
Soodak O
baked O
with O
cheese O
sauce. O

Gazpacho B-TARGET
was O
too O
sharp, O
even O
though O
I O
asked O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
to O
make O
this O
dish O
not O
sharp. O

The O
tobacco O
chicken O
was O
delicious, O
but O
as O
for O
the O
grill B-TARGET
vegetables, I-TARGET
it O
wasn't O
grilled, O
it O
was O
fried O
in O
large O
quantities O
of O
eggplant O
oil, B-TARGET
zucchini I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Bulgarian I-TARGET
peppers, I-TARGET
it O
was O
very O
untasteful. O

My O
husband O
didn't O
like O
it O
either, O
the O
dish B-TARGET
seemed O
fat O
enough. O

Friends O
ordered O
a O
barbecue O
barbecue, B-TARGET
but O
it O
didn't O
look O
like O
a O
barbecue. O

They O
also O
ordered O
white B-TARGET
spilled I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
and O
regretted O
it, O
and O
after O
that, O
their O
head O
was O
sore O
(other O
than O
a O
drink O
of O
wine O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
no O
alcohol O
was O
consumed O
on O
that O
day). O

They O
ordered O
a O
bread O
basket O
for O
four O
people O
with O
different O
kinds O
of O
bread, O
almost O
all O
the O
bread B-TARGET
was O
warm, O
soft O
and O
tasty, O
but O
the O
slices O
of O
white B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
were O
very O
tasty O
of O
mold. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant's O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
cozy O
enough, O
the O
maintenance's B-TARGET
medium. O

We're O
not O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
anymore, O
because O
we O
didn't O
like O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
as O
a O
whole. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
write O
is O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
disgusting! O

I've O
been O
to O
you O
three O
times, O
all O
three O
times, O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
for O
ten O
minutes, O
waiting O
for O
me O
to O
be O
noticed, O
ten O
more O
while O
the O
menu O
comes O
in... O

And O
how O
long O
I've O
been O
waiting O
for O
an O
order O
to O
be O
accepted... O
I'm O
not O
talking O
at O
all!!! O

Which O
I O
would O
understand O
if O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
besides O
me, O
there O
was O
only O
table O
3... O

All O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
with O
faces, O
like O
they're O
just O
trying O
to O
destroy O
me... O

With O
the O
horror O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
not O
even O
the O
bad, O
very O
comfortable O
and O
cozy O
sofas, B-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
your O
wonderful O
act, O
which, O
to O
my O
pleasant O
surprise, O
acts O
on O
the O
entire O
menu, O
not O
just O
on O
the O
sushi/rolls!!! O

If O
you O
work O
with O
the O
staff, O
you'll O
have O
a O
great O
place...!!! O

I'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
seeing O
you O
again! O

Our O
family O
really O
likes O
to O
be O
in O
this O
cafe. B-TARGET

The O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
children's B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
the O
children's B-TARGET
chairs. I-TARGET

Everything O
is O
delicious O
and O
interesting. O

It's B-TARGET
a O
comfortable O
and O
relaxing O
environment. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
service. B-TARGET

We're O
always O
making O
reservations O
in O
advance. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
serve O
professionally, O
but O
not O
unduly. O

You O
don't O
seem O
to O
be O
served, O
you O
seem O
to O
be O
cared O
for. O

It's O
a O
great O
pleasure O
to O
be O
told O
about O
any O
dish O
and O
to O
give O
the O
best O
advice. O

It's O
not O
just O
your O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
gets O
off O
the O
table, O
it's O
anyone O
else's. O

And O
if O
you O
drink O
tea O
with O
cake, O
you'll O
all O
be O
able O
to O
bring O
in O
a O
few O
waiters B-TARGET
at O
the O
same O
time. O

It's O
very O
convenient O
and O
pleasant O
to O
drink O
tea O
together, O
not O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
others O
to O
get O
dessert. O

And O
no O
one's O
gonna O
look O
at O
you O
waiting O
for O
you O
to O
leave O
soon O
after O
you O
all O
ate. O

All O
for O
full O
pleasure O
and O
pleasure. O

We O
visit O
the O
cafe O
once O
a O
week O
for O
the O
family O
only O
to O
enjoy O
a O
delicious O
and O
varied O
food B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

I'm O
not O
gonna O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
anyone O
because O
it's O
too O
tight! O

Saturday O
night, O
there's O
practically O
no O
room O
in O
the O
non-smoker O
zone. O

In O
September, O
the O
Dubrov O
wedding O
was O
celebrated... O

Whenever O
we O
met O
with O
the O
master, O
he O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
happy O
and O
assured O
us O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
wonderful! O

Everything O
was O
set O
in O
advance, O
but O
we O
decided O
to O
send O
two O
guests O
to O
the O
cafeteria O
an O
hour O
before O
the O
party O
began O
to O
supervise O
the O
preparations O
that O
the O
owner O
had O
warned O
us O
of! O

When O
our O
friends O
arrived, O
the O
host B-TARGET
expressed O
surprise... O

The O
cafe O
wasn't O
closed O
for O
the O
time O
of O
the O
preparations, O
the O
last O
visitor O
left O
five O
minutes O
before O
we O
arrived... O

The O
staff, B-TARGET
to O
put O
it O
mildly, O
was O
lacking O
and O
the O
master O
asked O
our O
friends O
to O
wash O
the O
fruit O
themselves, O
set O
the O
tables, O
etc. O

Around O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
party, O
the O
host O
reported O
that O
he O
was O
not O
feeling O
well O
and O
would O
go O
home O
(it O
must O
be O
added O
that O
he O
was O
actively O
involved O
in O
the O
service).. O

There's O
one O
waiter B-TARGET
left O
with O
us O
who, O
despite O
a O
small O
number O
of O
guests, O
has O
been O
completely O
out O
of O
control... O

We B-TARGET
literally I-TARGET
cleaned I-TARGET
the O
dishes O
ourselves. O

The O
cake O
must O
have O
been O
waiting O
for O
half O
an O
hour... O

Several O
times O
they O
asked O
him O
to O
take O
it O
out, O
and O
then O
they O
waited O
a O
long O
time O
for O
cups, O
tea, O
etc. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
looked O
like O
a O
street O
boy O
who O
doesn't O
even O
know O
what O
we O
want O
him O
to... O

All O
in O
all, O
the O
cooking O
was O
delicious, O
the O
service O
was O
good O
too, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
attitude O
shook O
and O
somewhat O
ruined O
the O
general O
impression O
of O
the O
holiday... O

Visited O
the O
establishment O
during O
the O
day. O

I O
guess O
it O
wasn't O
lunch O
or O
dinner, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

Let's O
just O
say O
that O
the O
interior B-TARGET
isn't O
anything, O
but O
the O
view B-TARGET
forgives O
everything, O
even O
if O
it's O
the O
side O
of O
our O
home O
town. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
on O
a O
good O
level. O

Quick, O
quality O
service, B-TARGET
though O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
forgot O
to O
bring O
one. O

The O
satellites O
loved O
everything O
they O
ordered, O
and O
crab B-TARGET
and O
pasta B-TARGET
salad O
and O
risotto, B-TARGET
Sibas B-TARGET
fish. O

The O
desserts O
picked O
everything O
out O
of O
the O
menu, O
except O
the O
pie O
of O
the O
day. O

We O
tried O
each O
other. O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

The O
cookie B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
slowly O
but O
surely O
starting O
to O
turn O
from O
a O
decent O
place O
to O
a O
normal O
diner. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Cookies O
for O
lunch O
several O
times O
a O
week O
and O
were O
their O
regular O
clients. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
last O
1.5 O
to O
2 O
months O
after O
going O
to O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
there O
are O
only O
unpleasant O
experiences: O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
"not O
at O
the O
level," O
the O
administrators, B-TARGET
they're O
gonna O
be... O

Today, O
after O
a O
few O
joints, O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
politely O
asked O
me O
to O
invite O
the O
administrator. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
came O
in O
20 O
minutes O
later O
and O
said, O
"I'm O
sorry, O
but O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
is O
so O
busy O
that O
she O
can't O
come O
to O
you. O

You O
can O
come O
after O
1600!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O
What O
do O
you O
think??????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????????? O

There's O
just O
no O
words! O

Anyway, O
no O
one O
who O
knows O
anything O
about O
decent O
restaurants O
is O
going O
to O
the O
board. O
Don't O
recommend B-TARGET
it! O

It O
was O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago. O

The O
place's B-TARGET
fine, O
the O
interior's B-TARGET
fine. O

A O
menu O
of O
Italian, O
French O
music... O
food B-TARGET
like O
nothing. O

The O
truth O
of O
the O
fish B-TARGET
is O
probably O
not O
the O
first O
time O
they're O
getting O
fresh, O
which O
is O
why O
they're O
overcooking O
it O
to O
rubber. O

Some O
fish B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
are O
missing, O
explained O
by O
Friday, O
eaten O
all... O

Although O
we O
were O
Saturday O
night, O
and O
we O
were O
the O
only O
customers. O

And O
the O
rest, O
of O
the O
chosen B-TARGET
one, I-TARGET
was I-TARGET
normal. I-TARGET

I O
really O
liked O
the O
desserts. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
good. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
nice. O

I'd O
go O
again... O

Just O
more O
people... O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places! B-TARGET

We O
spent O
almost O
all O
summer O
there! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
chat O
and O
have O
a O
tasty O
beer B-TARGET
with O
toast O
or O
squid O
rings O
here! O

The O
interior's O
very O
cozy, O
we've O
sat O
wherever O
we O
can, O
there's O
one O
less O
thing O
on O
the O
street O
in O
the O
summer O
that O
they O
sometimes O
close O
up O
and O
forget O
about O
people O
upstairs. O

And O
inside, O
I O
like O
sitting O
at O
both O
the O
table O
and O
the O
counter. O

The O
bartenders O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
work O
immediately, O
and O
after O
the O
order, O
there's O
a O
minute O
and O
a O
beer O
in O
front O
of O
you O
with O
different O
snacks, O
and O
here's O
what O
I O
can O
tell O
you, O
it's O
always O
been O
delicious. O

I O
suggest O
you O
take O
assortments B-TARGET
out I-TARGET
of O
snacks O
(with O
cheese O
sticks O
and O
squid O
rings, O
potatoes O
and O
sausage) O
in O
sufficient O
quantities. O

Personally, O
I O
like O
the O
cherry B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
almonds, I-TARGET
and O
in O
principle, O
I've O
tasted O
all O
kinds O
of O
sweet B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
there, O
because O
I O
love O
it, O
there O
were O
about O
five O
to O
six O
varieties O
in O
the O
summer. O

They O
said O
there O
was O
only O
cherry O
this O
weekend. O

The O
guys O
are O
out O
there, O
too, O
saying O
that O
beer B-TARGET
is O
super O
special O
to O
Guinness. B-TARGET

Anyway, O
we O
like O
it O
there, O
and O
we O
put O
our O
friends O
up O
there. O

Sometimes O
you O
can O
ask O
the O
music O
to O
be O
louder O
if O
you're O
playing O
some O
famous O
hit. O

It O
makes O
us O
feel O
like O
we're O
at O
home! O

Good O
afternoon! O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
we O
celebrated O
September O
9th, O
2010 O
your O
husband's O
birthday. O

Until O
that O
day, O
Pizza O
Hut O
in O
Moscow's O
224 O
was O
last O
visited O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
was O
pleased, O
so O
they O
came O
back O
from O
the O
old O
memory, O
but... O
wait O
15 O
minutes O
for O
the O
waiter O
to O
go, O
hooray, O
waiter O
came O
up, O
we O
ordered O
a O
toast, O
a O
beer, O
a O
caesar O
salad O
and O
a O
pizza. O

The O
grannies O
were O
carrying O
around O
20 O
minutes, O
not O
getting O
to O
our O
table, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
dropped O
them O
on O
the O
floor... O
then O
they O
were O
waiting O
for O
the O
toast O
again, O
and O
then O
they O
were O
brought O
in O
with O
a O
warm O
beer, B-TARGET
and O
then O
they O
brought O
Caesar's O
salad, O
and O
I O
think O
we O
all O
know O
what O
he O
looks O
like, O
turns O
out O
not. O

The O
caesar O
salad O
consisted O
of O
the O
following O
components: O
there O
were O
four O
large O
pieces O
(namely O
pieces) O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
baget O
on O
top O
of O
the O
lettuce O
leaves, O
then O
a O
little O
tomato O
and O
four O
large O
stripes O
of O
chicken, O
no O
parmesan B-TARGET
at O
all, O
cool? O

Then O
they O
brought O
pizza B-TARGET
- O
it O
must O
have O
been O
made O
of O
rubber. O

It's O
not O
cheap, O
the O
service... O
yeah, O
forgot O
to O
drink O
that O
there O
was O
still O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
but O
the O
musician B-TARGET
was O
out O
of O
line. O

It's O
getting O
scary O
that O
less O
and O
less O
of O
a O
decent O
restaurant O
stays O
at O
Peter's. O

We're O
never O
going O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
again. O

This O
cafe O
just O
happened O
to O
come O
in O
without O
finding O
the O
right O
place! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
cafe O
really O
liked O
it, O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
stay O
that O
way O
without O
looking O
at O
the O
menu. O

The O
next O
day O
they O
came O
with O
their O
friends, O
and O
they O
were O
also O
thrilled! O

To O
the O
credit O
of O
the O
cafe, O
we O
would O
like O
to O
refer O
to O
the O
following: O
(1) O
a O
tasty O
kitchen B-TARGET
(2) O
available O
prices O
(3) O
a O
comfortable O
environment B-TARGET

To O
the O
negatives: O
location B-TARGET
(in O
the O
yard), O
but O
it O
doesn't O
bother O
me O
very O
much! O

We O
met O
in O
this O
pub O
with O
a O
friend. O

It O
was O
Thursday O
afternoon. O

There O
weren't O
many O
visitors O
at O
first, O
but O
the O
closer O
it O
was O
to O
the O
evening, O
the O
more O
the O
bar O
filled. O

There O
was O
no O
smoking O
in O
the O
room, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
good O
and O
well O
thought-out O
ventilation B-TARGET
system. O

Nice, O
comfortable O
pub-style O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
really O
nice O
menu, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
pretty O
full, O
it's O
delicious. O

And O
large O
portions, B-TARGET
which O
men O
don't O
like. O

My O
friend's O
been O
here O
a O
lot O
more O
often O
than O
me, O
says O
she's O
tried O
almost O
everything, O
and O
she O
likes O
it. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
quickly, O
to O
my O
hilarious O
comment O
about O
something O
light O
and O
low O
calorie, O
reacted O
very O
quickly O
and O
offered O
several O
options, O
although O
I O
wasn't O
going O
to O
follow O
a O
strict O
diet O
or O
any O
restrictions O
on O
food O
at O
all. O

In O
general, O
all O
the O
questions O
were O
answered O
immediately O
and O
exhaustively, O
which O
is O
a O
pleasure. O

Maybe O
she O
didn't O
always O
respond O
lightningly O
to O
our O
requests, O
but O
the O
job O
was O
good. O

There O
was O
a O
slight O
defect-- O
there O
was O
a O
very O
small O
range B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
on O
that O
day. O

But O
since O
I O
was O
driving, O
I O
didn't O
care, O
and O
my O
friend O
was O
helped O
to O
make O
the O
right O
choice O
and O
she O
was O
happy. O

Outcome: O
The O
pub B-TARGET
liked O
it. O

If O
there O
are O
any O
meetings O
in O
this O
neighborhood O
or O
if O
you O
just O
want O
to O
eat, O
I'm O
gonna O
go O
over O
there O
again. O

It's O
a O
pleasure O
to O
leave O
a O
new O
review O
of O
Puri! B-TARGET

It O
has O
been O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
since O
the O
first O
visit O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
initially O
due O
to O
purely O
objective O
circumstances, O
the O
convenience O
of O
the O
house, O
but O
each O
time O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
left O
a O
better O
and O
better O
impression. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
careful, O
even O
when O
the O
restaurant O
is O
completely O
loaded, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
is O
always O
in O
the O
area O
of O
visibility; O
he O
can O
always O
tell O
you O
what O
a O
dish O
is; O
everything O
is O
delivered/cleaned O
on O
time. O

I'd O
like O
to O
say O
thank O
you O
to O
the B-TARGET
young I-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
I O
think O
the O
name O
is O
Ilya, O
well O
done! O

The B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
was O
satisfied O
every O
time O
- O
salads B-TARGET
are O
always O
from O
fresh O
vegetables, O
insanely O
tasty O
hachapuri, B-TARGET
a O
very O
decent O
lagman. B-TARGET

There's O
no O
good O
wine B-TARGET
map. I-TARGET

For O
a O
long O
time O
now, O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
in O
the O
form O
of O
Iran, O
who O
loves O
this O
drink, O
will O
appreciate O
it. O

Anyway, O
well O
done, O
a O
long O
time O
ago, O
and O
by O
5+, O
they O
fixed O
the O
gaps O
in O
the O
opening O
period. O

And O
right O
now, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
the O
U-V O
edge O
of O
our O
city. O

I'll O
keep O
coming O
over O
for O
dinner O
and O
dinner. O

By O
the O
way, O
it's O
getting O
better O
with O
the O
parking B-TARGET
lot. O

I O
was O
recently O
with O
Wife O
at O
this O
restaurant, O
and O
I O
liked O
the O
service, B-TARGET
but O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
could O
have O
been O
faster. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
likes O
everything O
in O
a O
strict O
fashion. O

They O
ordered O
some O
barbecues, O
caesar O
salad, O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

I'm O
gonna O
say O
the O
kitchen's B-TARGET
amazing, O
and O
it's O
quick, O
and O
it's O
delicious. O

I O
just O
go O
to O
restaurants O
a O
lot O
and O
order O
mostly O
caesar O
salads O
and O
caesar O
salads, O
and O
I O
have O
something O
to O
compare, O
and O
I'll O
tell O
you O
that O
salad B-TARGET
costs O
my O
money, O
and O
sausage, O
too, O
but O
the O
bar's B-TARGET
a O
little O
expensive. O

The O
truth O
went O
on O
long O
enough, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
probably O
thought O
we'd O
sit O
down O
and O
order O
something O
else, O
but O
it O
didn't O
bother O
us O
much O
because O
we O
wanted O
romance O
near O
the O
Gulf O
of O
Finland. O

I'll O
be O
honest O
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
romantic O
and O
the O
food O
is O
delicious, O
it's O
the O
right O
place. B-TARGET

The O
truth O
is, O
it's O
not O
the O
season O
and O
we O
weren't O
sitting O
on O
the O
street O
(cold) O
but O
we O
were O
sorry. O

I O
hope O
next O
summer O
we'll O
be O
there O
and O
we'll O
sit O
together O
with O
our O
wife O
in O
a O
romantic O
setting. B-TARGET

I O
wish O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
success O
and O
prosperity. O

They O
used O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Eurasia O
Gold O
on O
Little O
Posada. O

Of O
course O
not O
on O
the O
DF:) O

But O
once O
I O
was O
at O
a O
wedding O
(there O
was O
hardly O
any O
food, O
so O
I'm O
just O
gonna O
talk O
about O
my O
visits O
just O
"to O
eat". O

What's O
GOLD O
attracted? O

It O
so O
happens O
that O
during O
the O
frequent O
visit, O
a O
good O
relationship O
has O
been O
established O
with O
the O
waiters, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
problem O
with O
the O
maintenance... B-TARGET

From O
the O
food, O
I O
almost O
always O
eat O
and O
drink O
the O
same O
thing: O
Miso-sup O
(it's O
hard O
to O
spoil, O
it's O
practically O
the O
same), O
Philadelphia O
-- O
unlike O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
network's O
restaurants, O
the O
roll O
is O
big O
and O
very O
tasty, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell, O
all O
the O
products O
are O
fresh O
(where O
the O
dry O
rice O
comes O
from, O
but O
here O
with O
this O
okay) O
-- O
two O
of O
my O
favorites O
-- O
baked O
meadies O
-- O
not O
as O
often O
as O
I O
order O
them O
in O
other O
places, O
but O
as O
big O
and O
delicious O
as O
Gold, O
I O
haven't O
seen O
anywhere) O
and O
Minari O
(sweet O
roll O
with O
banana O
and O
chocolate, O
also O
delicious). O

I O
always O
advise O
everyone. O

I O
don't O
know O
how O
it O
is O
now, O
but O
two O
months O
ago, O
when O
I O
ordered O
it, O
I O
was O
asked O
whether O
it O
was O
big O
or O
small. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
Big O
is O
practically O
a O
bucket:)) O

It's O
a O
very O
good O
mojito. B-TARGET

I O
can't O
talk O
all O
over O
the O
kitchen. O

But O
my O
subjective O
impression O
is O
that O
my O
four O
favorite O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
Mojitos B-TARGET
in O
Gold O
are O
the O
best O
in O
town! O

We O
were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
the O
day O
off. O

We O
enjoyed O
both O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
the O
maintenance B-TARGET
and O
the O
general O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Behind O
such O
a O
stylish, O
most O
interesting O
interior B-TARGET
and O
very O
diverse O
menu B-TARGET
is O
hospitality B-TARGET
and O
respect, O
no O
paphos O
and O
unreasonable O
prices, O
and O
quality O
is O
consistent O
with O
delivery. B-TARGET

On O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
weekend, O
we O
were O
free O
to O
choose O
from O
several O
tables, O
living B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
was O
wonderful, O
unaddictive O
and O
very O
harmoniously O
chosen O
repertoire. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
menu O
really O
made O
a O
long O
choice, O
and O
not O
because O
there's O
nothing O
to O
choose O
from, O
but O
it's O
a O
lot O
I O
wanted O
to O
try. O

The O
food B-TARGET
that O
was O
ordered O
was O
nice B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
served I-TARGET
and O
tasted, O
it O
was O
a O
rabbit B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
peanut I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
ravioli B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
and O
eggplants B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomatoes. I-TARGET
It's O
delicious. O

Too O
bad O
we O
didn't O
get O
to O
desserts. O

It's O
been O
a O
pleasure O
to O
be O
here, O
hoping O
we'll O
spend O
more O
time O
in O
this O
place:) O

The O
eggplants B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
are O
just O
magical! O

Thank O
you! O

We O
wish O
you O
the O
same O
identity O
and O
original!:) O

Hey, O
everybody! O

Visited O
this O
week O
with O
a O
friend O
of O
the O
Cafe O
and O
the O
seductive O
name O
of O
appetite) O

At O
the O
entrance, O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
smiley O
girl, B-TARGET
who O
asked O
us O
where O
we'd O
like O
to O
sit O
down O
and O
give O
us O
a O
menu. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
well-placed, O
comfortable O
couchs, B-TARGET
calm O
music B-TARGET
) O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
approached O
almost O
immediately, O
advised O
me O
to O
try O
Sakur O
desserts O
and O
strawberry O
tea!) O

You O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long, O
you O
brought O
everything O
fast, O
which O
is O
very O
happy O
when O
you O
order O
a O
prudel. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
points B-TARGET
in O
the O
price/quality O
ratio, O
we'll O
have O
to O
come O
in O
again O
to O
try O
the O
dishes O
with O
the O
original O
names) O

Let's O
go O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
for O
dinner O
with O
good O
feedback O
on O
various O
sites. O

We O
had O
dinner O
together O
with O
our O
husband. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
well O
equipped O
to O
eat. O

I O
consider O
Ikea B-TARGET
furniture I-TARGET
more O
positively O
than O
negatively)) O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
pretty O
quick O
and O
considerate. O

It's O
true, O
as O
someone's O
written O
here O
before, O
for O
some O
reason O
there's O
been O
a O
different... O
weird O
approach. O

Now, O
as O
far O
as O
the O
kitchen's O
concerned, O
I O
wanted O
to O
order O
paste O
first, O
but O
it O
turns O
out O
you O
can't O
have O
half B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
serving I-TARGET
and O
a O
whole O
serving B-TARGET
of O
500 O
gras, O
which O
is O
just O
impossible O
for O
me O
to O
eat.)) O

It's O
not O
all O
about O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
that O
a O
pack B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
macaroni I-TARGET
can O
be O
snuggled, O
and O
it's O
worth O
thinking O
about O
the O
fragile O
girls O
who O
are O
clients! O

I O
had O
to O
get O
some O
soup. O

I O
picked O
out O
a O
broccoli O
cream O
soup O
that O
I O
love O
very O
much. O

But O
more O
so B-TARGET
than O
anything O
I've O
ever O
eaten. O

I O
didn't O
think O
it O
could O
be O
spoiled O
like O
this: O
it O
smelled O
like O
burnt O
vultures B-TARGET
(I O
love O
the O
salou, O
but O
I O
don't O
think O
salu O
is O
the O
place O
in O
a O
broccoli O
cream O
soup) O
or O
just O
the O
smell(() O

I O
had O
to O
eat O
bread O
and O
butter O
and O
steal O
from O
my O
husband's O
lasagna, B-TARGET
which, O
by O
the O
way, O
was O
pretty O
decent. O

My O
husband O
was O
quite O
pleased, O
and O
I O
left O
not O
hungry O
(the O
bread B-TARGET
was O
delicious)) O

Maybe O
I'm O
just O
unlucky, O
but O
I've O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
I'm O
not O
going O
there O
anymore. O

I've O
been O
going O
to O
this O
place O
ever O
since O
it O
was O
called O
Dry O
House. O

With O
the O
change O
of O
name, O
the O
menu O
changed O
a O
little O
bit, O
and O
I O
didn't O
notice O
any O
more O
changes. O

It's O
a O
very O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
very O
quiet O
(provided O
only O
one O
room) O
tables O
are O
apart, O
so O
if O
people O
are O
sitting O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
you, O
you O
can O
still O
talk O
and O
eat O
quietly O
without O
listening O
to O
other O
people's O
conversations. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
nothing O
particularly O
impressive O
except O
the O
toilet. O

The O
food O
is O
cooked O
fast, O
it's O
brought O
in O
fast, O
too. O

There's O
been O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
waiting O
for O
a O
hot O
one. O

The O
girls B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice, O
nice, O
always O
help O
me O
out. O

I O
can O
mark O
salmon B-TARGET
cream O
and O
seafood B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
from O
specific O
dishes. O

It's O
delicious! O

Several O
times O
she O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
there O
in O
a O
narrow O
family O
circle. O

The O
flower O
varnish O
is O
always O
brought O
by O
themselves O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
see O
the O
visitor O
coming O
with O
the O
flowers. O

Nice. O

Every O
time O
they O
came O
out, O
they O
were O
hungry O
and O
very O
happy. O

My O
favorite O
sushi B-TARGET
in O
town. O

We O
were O
there O
and O
we O
won't O
go O
again! O

Terrible O
service! B-TARGET

The O
kitchen's B-TARGET
not O
good, O
it's O
not O
worth O
what O
it O
says O
on O
the O
menu. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
concerned, O
it's O
completely O
out O
of O
line O
with O
the O
name. O

We O
came O
there O
to O
celebrate O
our O
friend's O
birthday. O

It O
started O
with O
a O
humming O
waiter O
coming O
up O
to O
us, O
an O
intern O
who O
doesn't O
know O
the O
basics O
of O
what O
the O
dish O
is O
made O
of... O

Then O
in O
a O
half-empty O
restaurant, O
we O
waited O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
for O
our O
order. O

What O
we O
ate O
didn't O
bring O
any O
pleasure, O
only O
more O
than O
less O
drinks, B-TARGET
but O
it O
didn't O
even O
make O
it O
possible O
to O
leave O
10p O
for O
tea... O

We O
weren't O
happy! O

We're O
not O
going O
there O
again O
and O
we're O
not O
gonna O
recommend O
it O
to O
our O
friends! O

This O
place B-TARGET
left O
a O
double O
view. O

On O
the O
one O
hand, O
an O
interesting O
interior, B-TARGET
a O
decent O
kitchen B-TARGET
(ordered O
pasta B-TARGET
and O
wine), B-TARGET
but O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
(laughed, O
didn't O
remember O
the O
name) O
bored O
us O
in O
order. O

That's O
what O
happened. O

We O
came O
this O
afternoon, O
after O
lunch, O
there O
weren't O
many O
people O
in O
the O
room, O
so O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
right O
up O
to O
us. O

Got O
the O
order O
and O
disappeared! O

Waiting O
for O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
for O
20 O
minutes, O
then O
another O
paste O
for O
25... O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
the O
bartender B-TARGET
looked O
at O
us O
very O
strangely O
when O
we O
came O
to O
find O
out O
about O
the O
hot O
stuff. O

But O
whoever O
it O
is, O
we O
thought O
we O
were O
right, O
because O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
showed O
up O
and O
apologized. O

And O
then O
there O
was O
a O
show! O

He O
suddenly O
came O
up O
every O
five O
minutes O
(as O
long O
as O
we O
ate) O
and O
talked O
about O
a O
show O
program O
to O
be O
held O
tonight. O

After O
"We'll O
definitely O
come," O
he O
left O
and O
showed O
up O
again O
with O
a O
new O
supply O
of O
information. O

After O
the O
third O
approach, O
I O
couldn't O
take O
it, O
and O
I O
asked, O
"Is O
there O
anyone O
I O
can O
talk O
to? O
How's O
the O
bartender?" O
We O
got O
a O
perfectly O
sincere O
"She's O
got O
a O
poms O
today!" O

It's O
a O
good O
thing O
we O
ate O
by O
the O
time O
we O
got O
this O
masterpiece. O

They O
asked O
for O
the O
bill. O

They O
bowed O
down O
and O
decided O
not O
to O
come O
to O
this O
gentleman's O
place:) O

We're O
out O
there O
from O
time O
to O
time O
with O
our O
husband. O

I O
love O
hot, O
crispy O
buns. B-TARGET

There's O
three O
of O
them: O
rye, O
wheat O
and O
mixed. O

They O
are O
sometimes O
served O
with O
butter O
) O
))) O

By O
the O
time O
the O
snacks O
are O
brought, O
the O
buns B-TARGET
off O
the O
table O
are O
gone: O
we O
can't O
just O
look O
at O
them, O
they're O
delicious. O

I've O
read O
a O
review O
of O
the O
hachapuri B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese, I-TARGET
and O
I O
want O
to O
try O
it, O
I'm O
sure O
it's O
gonna O
be O
great! O

I O
can't O
help O
ordering O
baked B-TARGET
mussels I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
that O
are O
on O
a O
large O
plate O
of O
sea O
salt. O

And O
I'll O
never O
give O
up O
a O
mutton B-TARGET
barbecue I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
a O
bone!!! O

Shashilyk B-TARGET
is O
extraordinary, O
as O
is O
his O
sauce. B-TARGET

And O
what's O
nice O
is O
they O
bring O
a O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
water I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
lemon I-TARGET
to O
the O
barbecue O
to O
rinse O
my O
hands: O
I O
like O
to O
eat O
with O
my O
hands. O

My O
husband O
usually O
orders O
fish, B-TARGET
which O
always O
makes O
me O
happy!!!! O

It's O
delicious!! O

We O
recommend O
it. O

The O
interior O
isn't O
going O
to O
be O
very O
happy, O
because O
it O
seems O
like O
an O
idea O
from O
the O
1990s... O
but O
it O
doesn't O
stop O
us O
from O
having O
a O
good O
time O
in O
this O
place. O

A O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
windows O
will O
add O
positive O
emotions. O

There O
are O
no O
complaints O
from O
staff B-TARGET
serving, O
but O
the O
surrender O
is O
not O
always O
wanted O
))) O

I O
love O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
so O
much! O

Beautiful O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
insanely O
tasty O
dishes! B-TARGET

But O
one O
year O
ago, O
there O
was O
a O
completely O
different O
staff B-TARGET
in O
this O
restaurant O
(other O
waiters, O
chief). O

The O
collection O
that O
used O
to O
be, O
I O
liked O
it O
much O
better! O

The O
waiters O
knew O
the O
menu O
from O
and O
to, O
they O
could O
advise O
and O
tell O
each O
dish O
the O
details, O
they O
took O
the O
order O
without O
recording O
it, O
they O
could O
remember O
everything! O

They O
were O
insanely O
considerate, O
kind, O
and O
kind! O

After O
the O
staff B-TARGET
changed, O
I've O
been O
confused O
on O
a O
number O
of O
occasions O
with O
the O
dishes O
I've O
been O
ordering, O
bringing O
something O
completely O
different, O
forgetting O
something O
at O
all. O

The O
baby O
once O
spilled O
a O
cocktail, O
so O
we O
couldn't O
reach O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
for O
five O
minutes O
and O
wipe O
it O
ourselves! O

And O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
don't O
know O
much O
about O
their O
dishes O
isn't O
what O
I'm O
talking O
about! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
as O
good O
as O
it O
was. O

I O
used O
to O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it, O
and O
I O
went O
to O
it O
once O
a O
week O
for O
sure! O

But O
there's O
no O
such O
thing O
now. O

If O
I'd O
known O
the O
place O
where O
the O
old O
team O
was O
transferred, O
I'd O
have O
visited O
him O
most O
of O
the O
time... O

Nice O
place. B-TARGET

I O
went O
out O
with O
my O
girl O
in O
Crestovsky, O
thought O
I'd O
stop O
by O
for O
coffee. O

The O
girl O
really O
liked O
the O
tyramis B-TARGET
(it's O
her O
favorite O
dessert, B-TARGET
says O
it's O
cooked O
great). O

I O
ordered O
myself O
a B-TARGET
fruit I-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
which O
is O
pretty O
good, O
although O
I O
prefer O
calorie O
food O
:) O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
know O
their O
jobs. O

It's O
hard O
to O
say O
about O
the O
interior B-TARGET
because O
I O
don't O
know O
anything O
about O
it, O
but O
it's O
kind O
of O
done O
in O
French O
style. O

Nice O
restaurant! B-TARGET

I O
was O
looking O
for O
an O
eastern O
and O
not O
very O
expensive O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
I O
found O
it! O

The O
wedding O
was O
celebrated O
on O
May O
21, O
and O
there O
weren't O
many O
people. O

Nice O
administrator B-TARGET
Olga, O
immediately O
offered O
the O
VIP B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
which O
is O
the O
nicest O
thing, O
there's O
no O
separate O
charge O
for O
it. O

The O
tables O
weren't O
empty, O
salads B-TARGET
are O
all O
delicious, O
special O
attention O
to O
steak, B-TARGET
that's O
something! O

All O
my O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased, O
and O
by O
the O
way, O
the O
steak B-TARGET
remembers O
everyone O
who O
ate O
it O
:) O

The O
liquor O
was O
allowed, O
but O
we O
also O
bought O
some. O

It's O
really, O
really O
good! O

The O
toilets B-TARGET
are O
funny, O
in O
mirrors, O
and O
the O
water O
runs O
on O
the O
wall. O

And O
the O
kalyan B-TARGET
is O
really O
the O
best O
in O
town! O

Everybody!!!!!!!!! O

And O
it's O
not O
advertising, O
it's O
really O
nice O
and O
delicious O
and O
it's O
just O
nice O
to O
be O
in, O
new O
interior B-TARGET
solutions. O

It O
wasn't O
the O
first O
time O
I've O
visited O
a O
restaurant O
in O
MASSMIDIA O
with O
my O
husband. O

Honestly, O
after O
the O
visit, O
I O
was O
in O
shock O
for O
a O
while. O

Terrible. O

Massmedia, B-TARGET
what O
happened O
to O
you? O

Where'd O
that O
friendly O
staff O
go, O
and O
that O
almost O
perfect O
service? O

At O
first, O
like O
nothing, O
they O
met O
and O
planted O
it, O
and O
that's O
when O
it O
all O
started, O
my O
husband O
got O
a O
meal O
first, O
and O
it O
could O
be O
nothing, O
if O
it O
wasn't O
for O
the O
waiter's B-TARGET
answer: O
"Sorry, O
how O
was O
it O
made?" O

At O
the O
end O
of O
dinner, O
we O
were O
completely O
forgotten. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
seem O
to O
be O
more O
interested O
in O
communicating O
with O
the O
bartender O
and O
the O
administrator O
than O
with O
the O
guests O
of O
their O
restaurant. O

Massmedia O
teaches O
your O
staff B-TARGET
because O
it's O
the O
key O
to O
success. O

As O
a O
result, O
the O
evening O
is O
ruined. O

If O
you're O
gonna O
go O
in O
there, O
it's O
only O
for O
your O
favorite O
mussels, B-TARGET
and O
then O
you're O
gonna O
get O
out O
of O
there O
fast, O
until O
the O
arrogant O
staff B-TARGET
backslide, O
even O
if O
they're O
gonna O
run!!!! O

Honestly, O
we O
won't O
come O
again, O
and O
we O
don't O
advise O
others. O

What O
was O
the O
beginning? O

Anyone O
who O
likes O
tasty O
cooked O
food, B-TARGET
come O
to O
Diana, B-TARGET
you O
won't O
regret O
it. O

The O
other O
day, O
my O
colleagues O
and O
I O
celebrated O
another O
birthday O
there, O
and O
we O
all O
enjoyed O
it O
very O
much. O

Since O
we O
have O
many O
birthdays O
in O
the O
year, O
we O
have O
visited O
almost O
all O
such O
facilities O
near O
Senna O
and O
can O
easily O
compare O
them. O

Diana's O
kitchen B-TARGET
doesn't O
give O
up O
on O
the O
first O
drink, O
but O
the O
prices O
are O
much O
lower. O

At O
our O
request, O
they O
made O
cocktails, O
even O
though O
they O
were O
not O
on O
the O
menu. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
high O
too! O

Of O
the O
small O
ones, O
they've O
been O
cooking O
hot O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
and O
Mojito's B-TARGET
not O
used O
to O
caramel O
and O
too O
sweet. O

We O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
our O
guests, O
celebrating O
our O
birthday. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
bad, O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
carry O
drinks, O
and O
it O
had O
to O
be O
repeated O
several O
times O
by O
the O
waiter. B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
salads O
and O
second O
dishes O
in O
advance, O
prepaid, O
and O
the O
manager O
promised O
we'd O
be O
ready O
by O
the O
time O
we O
got O
here. O

It's O
like O
we O
weren't O
expected. O

The O
heat O
train's O
gone O
off O
the O
dock, O
and O
the O
table O
isn't O
set. O

The O
other O
one O
was O
served O
when O
the O
boat O
was O
coming O
back. O

Anyway, O
we O
barely O
had O
time O
to O
finish O
the O
food O
we O
ordered. O

Now O
the O
kitchen O
is O
small, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
is O
hard, O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
for O
this O
kind O
of O
food. B-TARGET

I O
didn't O
feel O
comfortable O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guests, O
the O
poor O
service B-TARGET
smoothed O
the O
beautiful O
view B-TARGET
out I-TARGET
of O
the O
window O
and O
the O
pleasant O
interior. B-TARGET

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
a O
few O
times. O

I O
can't O
say O
I'm O
a O
gourmet, O
but O
I O
liked O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

The O
thing O
is, O
I O
don't O
eat O
sushi O
and O
rolls, O
but O
I O
eat O
meat, O
and O
the O
soup O
would O
only O
take O
lunch O
for O
business. O

In O
short, O
you O
have O
to O
come O
here O
to O
those O
who O
prefer O
second B-TARGET
salads O
and O
salads, B-TARGET
and O
they're O
doing O
great. O

Thin B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
is O
a O
huge O
choice, O
and O
salads O
with O
vegetables, O
chicken, O
meat, O
etc. O

I O
mean, O
everything O
I O
love. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
environment B-TARGET
is O
concerned, O
yes, O
it's O
standard, O
but O
I'm O
not O
the O
theme O
of O
the O
Lebeds, O
which O
is O
why O
I'm O
not O
interested O
in O
mega-seyner O
finds, O
I'm O
here O
to O
eat, O
not O
to O
look O
at O
design. O

The O
same O
applies O
to O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
waitresses. O

People O
aren't O
enough O
and O
that's O
great. O

The O
smoking B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
separate, O
so O
it O
didn't O
bother. O

In O
maintenance, B-TARGET
100% O
joins O
the O
view O
that O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
shift. O

There O
were O
those O
who O
served O
on O
9 O
and O
there O
were O
on O
1 O
(these O
were O
dealt O
with O
immediately). O

The O
desserts-- O
they O
used O
to O
take O
ice O
cream, B-TARGET
which O
is O
delicious, O
but O
we O
have O
exactly O
the O
same O
weight O
selling O
around O
the O
house, O
which O
is O
nothing O
special. O

It's O
an O
energy O
restaurant. O

Come O
in O
with O
a O
young O
man, O
no O
waiter B-TARGET
looked O
at O
us! O

Sit O
down O
at O
the O
table O
you O
chose. O

Ten O
minutes O
wait O
for O
the O
waiter. B-TARGET

I O
couldn't O
wait... O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
menu O
myself. O

Another O
15 O
minutes O
of O
waiting... O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came. O

It's O
worse. O

In O
the O
time O
that O
we O
were O
expecting O
an O
order, O
two O
couples O
were O
served. O

To O
be O
honest, O
I O
already O
wanted O
to O
leave, O
but O
apparently O
I O
wanted O
to O
eat O
more, O
so O
I O
stayed. O

No O
pleasure O
at O
all. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
got O
here O
quickly O
was O
the O
bill... O

If O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
card, O
you're O
still O
looking O
for O
a O
positive O
emotion O
from O
going O
to O
a O
place B-TARGET
like O
this O
for O
any O
money. O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
watch O
football O
in O
this O
pub! O

Lots O
of O
screens, B-TARGET
conveniently O
arranged. O

Nice O
musical B-TARGET
escort. I-TARGET

This O
place O
has O
caused O
me O
to O
associate O
with O
the O
restaurant O
:) O

Good O
choice O
of O
good O
beer. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
deserves O
attention. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good, O
it's O
good. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
especially O
the O
pardon, O
and O
the O
ladies' B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
really O
liked O
it. O

But O
it's O
worth O
working O
on O
the O
professionalism O
of O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

There O
was O
an O
occasion O
when O
they O
ordered O
salads, O
waited O
a O
long O
time, O
in O
the O
general O
waitress, B-TARGET
forgot O
about O
them, O
had O
to O
disturb O
a O
young O
man O
serving O
a O
nearby O
table, O
the O
situation O
was O
fixed, O
another O
waitress B-TARGET
came, O
had O
already O
fulfilled O
her O
duties O
without O
being O
told. O

There O
was O
a O
feeling O
that O
there O
weren't O
enough O
waiters B-TARGET
for O
an O
entire O
room. O

I O
wish O
Finnegans O
prosperity, O
a O
good O
place. B-TARGET

I'm O
gonna O
tell O
you O
a O
wonderful O
story O
about O
how O
the O
Triple B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
values O
customers. O

My O
friend O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
her O
birthday O
at O
this O
place, O
so O
it O
happened O
that O
the O
celebration O
would O
coincide O
with O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
Easter O
holiday. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
empty! O

But, O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
his O
birthday O
:) O

I O
don't O
have O
a O
claim O
to O
service, B-TARGET
it's O
perfect! O

As O
a O
man O
who O
doesn't O
eat O
meat O
and O
a O
bird, O
it's O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
order. O

On O
that O
day, O
the O
hot O
food O
from O
the O
fish O
didn't O
attract O
my O
attention. O

She O
ordered O
a O
hot O
vegetable O
snack. O

I'll O
be O
honest, O
I O
didn't O
seem O
to O
like O
it O
very O
much O
(only O
because O
of O
the O
way O
the O
vegetables O
are O
cooked, O
because O
they're O
getting O
brilliant) O
the O
main O
thing O
is, O
it O
was O
amazingly O
good, O
given O
that O
I O
wasn't O
hungry O
by O
the O
time O
the O
meal B-TARGET
was O
served. O

It O
was O
the O
second O
time O
in O
my O
life O
I O
ate O
with O
that O
appetite. O

The O
party O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
dessert O
from O
the O
place) O

I O
can't O
get O
past O
the O
performance O
of O
artists. B-TARGET

Beautiful, O
professional. O

We've O
already O
decided O
to O
visit O
this O
place B-TARGET
from O
time O
to O
time. O

Thank O
you O
to O
Triple's B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
for O
the O
great O
impressions! O

I O
thank O
the O
entire O
family O
for O
organizing O
my O
mother's O
anniversary! O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
our O
conversation, O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
we O
can O
trust O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
hold O
an O
event O
of O
such O
importance O
to O
us. O

They O
offered O
different O
menus, B-TARGET
different O
seating O
options. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
event, O
the O
guests O
and O
the O
birthday O
lady O
were O
friendly, O
and O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
we O
were O
very O
much O
welcome O
here. O

According O
to O
the O
guests, O
and O
in O
our O
opinion, O
the O
restaurant's O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
adorable! O

Beautiful O
dishes, B-TARGET
design, B-TARGET
delivery, B-TARGET
and O
of O
course, O
the O
taste B-TARGET
is O
all O
high. O

The O
waiters' B-TARGET
work I-TARGET
wasn't O
visible, O
the O
dishes O
and O
the O
dishes O
changed O
as O
if O
they O
were O
themselves. O

You O
can't O
ignore O
the O
work B-TARGET
of O
Alexander's O
manager. O

Thanks O
to O
him, O
our O
holiday O
has O
become O
a O
celebration, O
not O
a O
concern O
for O
guests O
and O
food. O

I O
want O
to O
go O
back O
to O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
like O
this. O

I O
will O
certainly O
advise O
my O
friends O
and O
relatives, O
even O
though O
some O
of O
them O
have O
seen O
it! O

Thank O
you! O

On O
the O
second O
floor, O
on O
the O
first O
day O
of O
the O
meeting, O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
of O
Anna O
took O
a O
look O
at O
a O
few O
more O
places O
and O
decided O
to O
stop O
her O
choice O
on O
this O
relax O
cafe O
without O
delay. O

The O
men O
chose O
for O
1550 O
(there O
is O
more), O
and O
no O
regrets, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
food, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
beautifully O
distributed, O
arranged, O
no O
one O
left O
hungry! O

All O
our O
wishes/demands O
were O
met O
by O
the O
Administration. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
careful O
to O
clean O
the O
table, O
and O
they O
were O
always O
ready, O
and O
they O
agreed O
with O
us O
on O
a O
hot O
snack O
and O
a O
basic O
hot O
meal. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
liquor O
and O
food O
were O
folded O
and O
we O
all O
took O
something O
the O
same O
day O
(parents O
helped) O
the O
next O
day. O

I'm O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
place! B-TARGET

Beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
nice O
music, B-TARGET
responsive O
staff. B-TARGET

My O
husband O
and O
I O
would O
love O
to O
go O
to O
dinner O
there O
in O
a O
romantic O
setting) O

Thank O
you, O
Anna, O
for O
organizing O
such O
a O
wonderful O
holiday. O

On O
April O
17, O
2010, O
it O
was O
a O
family O
dinner. O

This O
restaurant O
was O
chosen O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
cafe. O

We O
didn't O
regret O
it. O

Because O
we O
didn't O
have O
any O
special O
interior O
requirements, O
except O
for O
the O
perfect O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
bay, I-TARGET
we O
got O
what O
we O
wanted. O

Non-intrusive O
music, B-TARGET
pretty O
decent O
waiters B-TARGET
(truths O
don't O
fold O
and O
do O
not O
pour O
wine). O

But O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
really O
liked O
it. O

Thank O
you, O
chef! B-TARGET

Four O
people O
ordered O
different O
salads O
and O
hotter O
ones. O

It's B-TARGET
big, O
it's O
delicious, O
it's O
served O
in O
time. O

I'm O
gonna O
recommend O
to O
everyone O
who O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
lunch O
after O
a O
walk. O

Prices O
are O
very O
democratic. O

On O
April O
17th, O
he O
visited O
your O
restaurant... O

I O
also O
noticed O
from O
the O
street O
your O
wonderful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
decided O
to O
have O
dinner O
at O
your O
place... O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
liked O
was O
the O
way O
your O
manager B-TARGET
Ilya O
met O
me, O
everything O
I O
love, O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
humor. O

After O
that, O
they O
put O
me O
at O
a O
table O
and O
I O
was O
nicely O
surprised O
that O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
kindly O
took O
my O
top O
clothes O
and O
hung O
me O
in O
the O
closet... O

Since O
it O
was O
your O
first O
time, O
I'm O
very O
grateful O
to O
waiter B-TARGET
Valentine O
for O
being O
able O
to O
explain O
all O
my O
questions O
about O
the O
menu. O

Again, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
your O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
positive. O

Valentine O
was O
irritating, O
and O
he O
really O
cheered O
me O
up O
after O
my O
day O
at O
work... O

After O
ordering O
a O
meal, O
it O
was O
very O
unexpected O
to O
receive O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
Pasket O
of O
deer... O

Who O
decorated O
my O
waiting O
for O
me O
to O
order O
a O
meal... O

Fifteen O
minutes O
later, O
I O
enjoyed O
your O
masterpieces. O

The O
kitchen, B-TARGET
as O
they O
say O
at O
the O
level... O

Gone O
from O
you O
full O
and O
happy) O

I O
hope O
your O
staff B-TARGET
is O
always O
as O
positive O
and O
kind... O

Guys, O
I O
hope O
the O
restaurant's O
running O
somehow, O
and O
my O
review O
won't O
go O
undetected... O

Thank O
you! O

P.S. O
I'll O
be O
sure O
to O
come O
back O
to O
you O
again... O

Just O
with O
my O
friends. O

Your O
kitchen B-TARGET
really O
liked O
it, O
valued O
it O
because O
I'm O
a O
cook O
myself...) O

Thanks O
again! O

We O
stopped O
by O
Diana O
on O
04.02.2011 O
to O
find O
a O
place O
for O
a O
family O
celebration. O

Strangely O
enough, O
there O
were O
no O
visitors O
but O
us, O
despite O
Friday O
night. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
met O
very O
nicely O
and O
nicely, O
and O
we O
felt O
at O
home O
from O
the O
doorstep. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
was O
very O
fond O
- O
solemn, O
elegant, O
but O
not O
pompous. O

There's O
pictures O
of O
famous O
restaurant O
guests O
on O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
bar. O

It's O
a O
small O
room, O
an O
interior B-TARGET
in O
noble O
red O
and O
blue O
tones, O
which O
creates O
a O
sense O
of O
serenity O
and O
comfort. O

The O
decorative B-TARGET
windows I-TARGET
with O
the O
scenery O
look O
particularly O
good! O

A B-TARGET
menu O
of O
thoughtful O
and O
varied, O
wonderful O
desserts, B-TARGET
there O
are O
excellent O
offers O
of O
feast O
dinners, O
and O
they're O
gonna O
order O
a O
cake B-TARGET
of O
any O
complexity. O

Especially O
the O
wine B-TARGET
card. I-TARGET

The O
wine B-TARGET
that O
the O
good O
host B-TARGET
of O
the O
house O
recommended O
to O
us O
was O
above O
praise! O

Actually, O
everything O
we O
were O
offered O
for O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

From O
the O
negative, O
it O
upset O
the O
women's O
toilet B-TARGET
(the O
door O
lock O
was O
not O
working), O
and O
the O
view O
of O
the O
lounge B-TARGET
is O
somewhat O
simple O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
interior. O

In O
general, O
Diana's B-TARGET
visit O
left O
the O
most O
warm O
memories, O
and O
we'll O
certainly O
go O
back O
there O
ourselves, O
and O
we O
can O
safely O
recommend O
this O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
both O
romantic O
dinner O
and O
a O
feast O
for O
30-35 O
people. O

A O
spoiled O
evening... O

We O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
the O
birthday O
with O
our O
husband O
and O
the O
day O
of O
the O
lovers O
(14 O
February). O

We O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
a O
week. O

They O
came O
in O
on O
time, O
they O
didn't O
remember O
us, O
they O
went O
through O
some O
records O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
yeah, O
found O
a O
note O
about O
the O
table O
reserve. O

Sit O
down. O

The O
music B-TARGET
from O
the O
dynamite O
just O
stunned O
at O
first, O
then O
nothing O
- O
used O
to O
it. O

The O
truth O
has O
not O
been O
able O
to O
talk O
calmly. O

An O
interior B-TARGET
for O
a O
threesome, O
that's O
not O
exactly O
what O
they're O
here O
for. O

- O
That's O
right, O
for O
the O
meat! O

They O
ordered O
ribai O
(590p) O
and O
karae O
(C. O
600p), O
along O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
beers O
to O
paint O
the O
wait. O

I O
don't O
appreciate O
the O
kitchen O
- O
since O
I O
couldn't O
try O
- O
in O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
(!) O
we O
never O
got O
any O
steaks... O

Didn't O
bring O
food O
to O
the O
other O
guests O
sitting O
next O
to O
us, O
who O
made O
the O
order O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

Throughout O
the O
waiting O
period, O
we O
have O
been O
approached O
only O
twice, O
even O
if O
we O
insist. O

When O
I O
got O
really O
bored O
asking O
for O
the O
bill. O

The O
administrator B-TARGET
came O
over, O
started O
pawning O
about O
how O
many O
people O
were O
crawling, O
about O
the O
chef B-TARGET
not O
getting O
there. O

Anyway, O
the O
hungry O
and O
the O
upset O
left. O

We're O
not O
going O
again. O

I O
really O
hope O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
get O
lucky. O

It's O
a O
great O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
opened O
it O
for O
myself O
by O
accident, O
thanks O
to O
the O
WGAPON. O

First O
time O
I O
booked O
a O
table O
for O
birthday O
three O
years O
ago. O

It's O
a O
favorite O
place B-TARGET
now. O

We O
always O
go O
out O
with O
a O
friend O
when O
we're O
on O
the O
stock. O

It's O
been O
a O
while O
since O
8 O
to O
10. O
Good O
cooking, O
good O
service. B-TARGET

Real O
guilt. B-TARGET

Interesting O
interior. B-TARGET

Beautiful O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window. O

I O
suggest O
you O
visit O
those O
who O
weren't. O

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
maintenance B-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

Hold O
the O
stamp! O

You're O
wonderful!!!!! O

Let's O
go O
again O
this O
Saturday. O

Today, O
the O
three-person O
company O
was O
in O
this O
place, O
and O
by O
the O
way, O
it O
wasn't O
exactly O
a O
cafe O
or O
a O
restaurant, O
and O
on O
the O
one O
hand, O
the O
idea O
of O
"the B-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
window" I-TARGET
is O
just O
a O
great O
idea, O
and O
it's O
like O
a O
restaurant O
idea, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
there's O
not O
much O
space O
("non-smoker O
room O
with O
a O
view O
to O
the O
kitchen" O
and O
"smoker" O
and O
"smoker" B-TARGET
room, O
and O
there's O
no O
extract B-TARGET
in O
the O
smoke O
room, O
and O
I've O
even O
imagined O
what O
it O
would O
be O
like O
if O
there O
were O
a O
bunch O
of O
companies O
there O
and O
they O
smoked O
so O
hard, O
there'd O
have O
to O
open O
a O
window O
from O
which, O
by O
the O
way, O
it O
blows O
very O
much O
- O
to O
eat! O

I O
went O
to O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
hoping O
for O
some O
good O
reviews O
in O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
and O
I O
wasn't O
wrong! O

"Cream B-TARGET
Soup I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
White I-TARGET
Mushrooms" I-TARGET
- O
tasty, O
I O
recommend, O
enjoyed O
all O
three O
of O
them O
:) O

"Pizza B-TARGET
Pro I-TARGET
Testo" I-TARGET
- O
because O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
they O
decided O
to O
immediately O
understand O
"yes" O
or O
"no" O
by O
ordering O
the O
largest-sized O
branded B-TARGET
pizza, I-TARGET
and O
again, O
they O
didn't O
wrong O
- O
the O
dough B-TARGET
is O
thin, O
the O
crunchy-- O
set-up, O
the O
filling B-TARGET
is O
good, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff, O
I O
don't O
remember O
the O
composition, O
but O
the O
taste O
is O
great! O

In O
general, O
it's O
cozy O
enough, O
just O
to O
play O
the O
lights O
some O
more, O
and O
also O
to O
fix O
the O
window O
in O
the O
smoking B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
through O
which O
the O
blow O
was O
very O
high, O
the O
lack O
of O
extraction B-TARGET
was O
written O
higher. O

: O
Young, O
not O
experienced O
:) O
but O
very O
kind, O
I'm O
comfortable O
with O
this O
service, B-TARGET
and O
I O
don't O
need O
it. O

The O
three O
of O
us O
were O
there O
at O
the O
end O
of O
January. O

The O
boss-in-law B-TARGET
(in O
one O
person) O
even O
smiled. O

Two O
girls B-TARGET
in O
black O
suits O
spent O
the O
entire O
evening O
in O
the O
fireplace, O
not O
in O
charge, O
not O
helping O
the O
waiters. B-TARGET

Just O
two O
statues O
with O
a O
boring O
face. O

Who O
are O
they? O

What O
are O
their O
functions? O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
forgot O
the O
order, O
came O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
later O
and O
asked O
around. O

After O
half O
an O
hour, O
she O
wasn't O
seen O
at O
all. O

They O
ordered O
dessert O
at O
the O
end. O

In O
15 O
minutes, O
they O
found O
out O
that O
the O
panaque O
would O
be O
ready O
in O
40 O
minutes. O

There O
is O
only O
one O
tyramis B-TARGET
left. O

After O
the O
coffee, O
they O
asked O
for O
the O
bill. O

They O
waited O
a O
long O
time O
because O
the O
girl B-TARGET
(see O
above) O
was O
a O
guest O
dresser. O

I O
brought O
the O
bill, O
and O
another O
15 O
minutes O
were O
waiting O
for O
the O
change. O

He O
spent O
three O
hours O
in O
a O
restaurant, O
two O
hours O
of O
waiting. O

I O
didn't O
like O
it O
at O
all. O

The O
kitchen's B-TARGET
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
meals B-TARGET
are O
tiny O
for O
not O
a O
small O
price. O

When O
we O
got O
out, O
the O
husband O
said, O
"There O
are O
snow O
queens O
working O
here." O

Or O
maybe O
they O
were O
tired, O
or O
maybe O
they O
all O
have O
what O
grief? O

I O
don't O
know. O

But O
there's O
no O
desire O
to O
go O
there O
anymore. O

P.S. O
An O
interior B-TARGET
of O
pleasant O
beige O
shades. O

But O
the O
couchs B-TARGET
were O
all O
dirty! O

I O
love O
it! O

We O
met O
nicely, O
and O
we O
went O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
menu O
and O
the O
dish O
were O
delivered O
quite O
quickly. O

Because O
of O
the O
high O
ceilings, O
there's O
no O
smell O
of O
cigarette B-TARGET
smoke I-TARGET
- O
100 O
points O
just O
for O
that! O

Great O
music, B-TARGET
good O
food B-TARGET
(especially O
Indian B-TARGET
cuisine). I-TARGET

The O
steak B-TARGET
is O
impeccable, O
although O
the O
sauce, B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion, O
should O
be O
different. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
from O
the O
negative O
is O
that O
the O
wardrobe B-TARGET
was O
cool O
and O
the O
clothes O
were O
pretty O
cold. O

Impressive!!!! O

The O
score O
seemed O
particularly O
democratic O
- O
it O
was O
nice O
to O
be O
surprised O
:) O

I O
recommend O
it!!!!!! O

I've O
been O
to O
Dykiri B-TARGET
many O
times, O
and O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
it's O
the O
best O
bar B-TARGET
in O
the O
city! O

First O
of O
all, O
you O
can't O
ignore O
the O
comfortable O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
bar O
and O
the O
very O
friendly O
and O
friendly O
staff! B-TARGET

It's O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
success O
factors O
for O
any O
institution! O

The O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
wonderful O
and, O
most O
nicely, O
at O
absolutely O
acceptable O
prices! O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
have O
a O
good O
time O
with O
your O
friends O
and O
enjoy O
some O
delicious O
cocktails! B-TARGET

It's O
better O
to O
book O
a O
place O
in O
advance!) O

He O
was O
at O
a O
restaurant O
on O
February O
10 O
on O
coupons, O
company O
five, O
and O
a O
reason O
to O
celebrate O
his O
birthday. O

It O
was O
really O
great. O

To O
be O
honest, O
I O
don't O
know O
why O
there O
are O
bad O
reviews O
here, O
but O
maybe O
I'm O
just O
lucky. O

I'm O
a O
very O
picky O
man, O
but O
I'm O
not O
gonna O
complain O
about O
anything, O
I'm O
gonna O
talk O
about O
the O
plus: O

1. O
The O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
city O
centre, O
near O
the O
subway-- O
you O
can't O
think O
of O
a O
better O
place. O

(2) O
The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
comfortable, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
not O
screaming O
(although O
it O
was O
sitting O
next O
to O
the O
column), O
the O
playlist B-TARGET
rejoices O
in O
the O
ear O
(lounge, O
if O
I O
am O
not O
mistaken) O

(3) O
The O
service B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

Our O
waiter, B-TARGET
Ilya, O
was O
funny, O
kind, O
and O
very... O
helpful O
and O
proactive, O
and O
he O
was O
professional O
in O
choosing O
a O
menu O
that O
would O
leave O
such O
a O
tip O
a O
pleasure. O

(4) O
Delicious! O
The O
Italian B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Japanese I-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
were O
also O
ordered, O
and O
everyone O
liked O
it. O

(5) O
Prices O
do O
not O
bite, O
given O
that O
this O
is O
the O
center B-TARGET
of O
the O
city O
and O
compare O
with O
other O
sushi B-TARGET
bars O
=) O

I'm O
gonna O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
my O
friends, O
and O
I'm O
happy O
to O
come O
again. O

We O
went O
on O
Saturday O
night O
to O
celebrate O
our O
birthday. O

Vasabi O
got O
bored, O
wanted O
something O
new, O
let's O
go O
to O
this O
place O
because O
it's O
relatively O
close O
to O
home. O

I O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
not O
all O
of O
it: O
the O
prawn O
soup B-TARGET
is O
great, O
but O
the O
pork B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
noodle O
sauce O
wasn't O
very-- O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
tasteless, O
the O
tyramis B-TARGET
is O
delicious-- O
rare O
where O
it's O
cooked O
well. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
non-addictive O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
wait, O
friendly O
and O
responsive. O

An O
amateur's O
interior. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
place, B-TARGET
but O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
very O
loud. O
I O
couldn't O
quite O
hear O
what O
they O
were O
saying, O
it's O
minus, O
but O
I O
hope O
when O
I O
come O
in O
the O
next O
time O
it's O
quieter. O

We O
walked, O
we O
walk O
and O
we O
walk! O

It's O
been O
a O
long O
time O
looking O
for O
a O
jazz O
club O
where O
you O
can O
not O
only O
sit O
behind O
a O
bar, O
but O
also O
have O
a O
nice O
meal O
at O
tables O
and O
chat. O

Found O
it. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
table O
instead O
of O
at O
a O
bar, O
you'd O
better O
book O
it O
in O
advance. O

Tonight's O
always O
a O
great O
show, B-TARGET
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
jazz. B-TARGET

A O
lot O
of O
people O
go O
out O
dancing, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
dance O
professionally, O
and O
it's O
always O
nice O
to O
look O
at O
them. O

It's O
not O
much O
fun O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
people O
who O
walk O
around O
and O
like O
to O
drink, O
of O
course. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
always O
good, O
everyone O
comes O
fast. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
always O
good. O

They O
ordered O
Rattatui, O
fish, O
and O
meat. O

Good O
wine, B-TARGET
lots O
of O
choices. O

Very O
nice O
design, B-TARGET
cozy O
and O
atmospheric. O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
for O
jazz O
fans O
and O
live O
music! O

Nice O
place! B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
super, O
very O
comfortable O
booths B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
soft I-TARGET
pillows. I-TARGET

We O
used O
to O
go O
there O
for O
dinner O
a O
lot O
after O
work. O

It's O
almost O
once O
tasted O
good O
for O
the O
food, B-TARGET
except O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
and O
fruits B-TARGET
could O
be O
the O
best O
quality O
since O
it's O
an O
eastern O
restaurant. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
always O
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

It's O
a O
beautiful O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
a O
good O
vacation. O

He O
was O
invited O
to O
Amaren-u, O
and O
a O
friend O
celebrated O
his O
birthday. O

I'll O
tell O
you O
right O
away, O
I'm O
not O
gonna O
name O
a O
single O
dish, O
'cause O
salads O
and O
raw O
meat O
plates O
have O
already O
been O
ordered, O
and O
the O
hot O
one O
I O
didn't O
order, O
but O
I O
managed O
to O
scoop O
out O
a O
piece O
of O
steak B-TARGET
from O
my O
lover's O
plate..... O
mmm... O
likes O
it, O
tastes O
good. O

Salatas B-TARGET
and O
appetizers B-TARGET
were O
also O
pleasant, O
and O
it O
was O
beautifully O
arranged O
and O
tasted O
great. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
could O
fix O
was O
the B-TARGET
pickles, I-TARGET
'cause O
they O
were O
tasteless. O

Our O
company O
was O
placed O
behind O
the O
curtains, O
so O
having O
a O
lot O
of O
vacationers O
didn't O
bother O
us O
at O
all. O

I O
thought O
I O
was O
serving O
us O
as O
a O
stranger, O
so O
quickly O
the O
dirty B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
disappeared O
from O
the O
table, O
and O
the O
drinks O
drank. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
cozy, O
and O
it's O
been O
a O
pleasure O
to O
have O
a O
separate O
room B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
karaoke. I-TARGET

We O
sang O
until O
4:00 O
in O
the O
morning. O

Thank O
you, O
it O
was O
vanderful. O

She O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
with O
a O
small O
company. O

In O
general, O
it's O
okay, O
but O
it's O
okay. O

On O
the O
plus O
side, O
we O
should O
celebrate O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

Bright O
old O
furniture, B-TARGET
cans B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
compotes, I-TARGET
crumbs, I-TARGET
interesting. O

I O
liked O
the O
homemade O
drinks. B-TARGET

Hot B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
but O
they're O
small. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
box I-TARGET
and O
the O
carrot B-TARGET
torso I-TARGET
with O
Philadelphia's O
cheese O
are O
really, O
really. O

There's O
not O
much O
smoke O
in O
the O
main O
room. B-TARGET

The O
non-smokers' O
room O
was O
busy O
at O
the O
wedding, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
book O
a O
table O
in O
the O
smoking O
room. O

Less: O
no O
wardrobe. B-TARGET

It's O
not O
nice O
to O
have O
someone O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
restaurant O
waiting O
in O
the O
top O
of O
their O
friends' O
clothes O
on O
the O
table. O

The B-TARGET
hangers I-TARGET
are O
overloaded O
with O
clothes O
and O
you O
can't O
sit O
next O
to O
them. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
very O
hard O
to O
catch O
yours. O

Maybe O
we O
were O
at O
the O
peak O
hour. O

Drinks O
(not O
cocktails) O
waited O
30 O
minutes O
to O
order. O

The O
female B-TARGET
administrators I-TARGET
don't O
have O
a O
badge O
and O
it's O
hard O
to O
tell O
them O
from O
the O
guests. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
doesn't O
say O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
servings. O

You O
have O
to O
ask O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
she O
rolls O
her O
eyes O
and O
remembers O
what O
the O
dish O
looks O
like. O

Churchela B-TARGET
didn't O
like O
it, O
it O
was O
frozen O
and O
tasteless. O

Yesterday O
we O
decided O
to O
open O
another O
Italian O
restaurant O
for O
ourselves. O

Someone O
I O
know O
advised O
Super O
Mario. O

That's O
where O
they O
went. O

They O
weren't O
disappointed, O
but O
they O
weren't O
very O
happy O
either. O

The O
first O
impression O
wasn't O
very O
much: O
a O
rather O
boring O
interior, B-TARGET
a O
little O
space, O
and O
only O
one O
table O
was O
busy O
-- O
and O
that's O
a O
day O
off O
tonight... O

But O
we O
decided O
to O
get O
some O
coffee. O

I've O
ordered O
a O
latte B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a O
ballis-- O
it's O
fast, O
it's O
delicious! O

My O
husband O
got O
some O
green B-TARGET
tea, I-TARGET
too. O

We O
softened O
and O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch, O
so O
I O
ordered O
mushroom B-TARGET
cream, O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
tasteless, O
but O
at O
least O
it's B-TARGET
big. O

My O
husband O
had O
chicken B-TARGET
broth I-TARGET
on O
literally O
three O
canteen O
spoons O
- O
very O
few. O

The B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
basket I-TARGET
is O
boring O
and O
not O
very O
tasty. O

My O
husband's O
lasagna B-TARGET
isn't O
so O
good. O

But O
I'm O
happy O
with O
the O
tyramis. B-TARGET
It's O
delicious, O
but O
it's O
not O
pretty O
in O
a O
cup. O

In O
general, O
the O
food B-TARGET
isn't O
good. O

The O
drinks B-TARGET
are O
really O
good. O

It's O
a O
huge O
plus O
toilet. B-TARGET

Very O
clean, O
neat, O
towels O
of O
all O
kinds O
and O
spacious O
- O
and O
a O
good O
toilet B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
important O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
I O
think. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
polite... O

They O
can O
put O
a O
four O
on O
a O
scale O
five. O

It O
was O
embarrassing O
to O
wash O
the O
floors O
in O
the O
hallway, O
and O
we O
saw O
it... O
it O
wasn't O
very O
good. O

The O
bill's O
fine, O
not O
very O
expensive, O
but O
it's O
not O
cheap. O

Anyway, O
one O
time O
you O
looked... O
there's O
better O
places, O
all O
the O
more O
so O
for O
that O
money. O

So O
whether O
or O
not O
we're O
gonna O
go O
back O
there. O

Hello, O
everyone, O
we've O
been O
to O
a O
restaurant O
recently, O
living O
nearby. O

They O
came O
in O
for O
dinner, O
they O
were O
happy, O
they O
were O
all O
very O
decent. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
spacious, O
but O
it's O
very O
cozy. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
accepted O
the O
order, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
too O
long O
to O
wait. O

We O
don't O
have O
the O
same O
company, O
so O
the O
dishes O
are O
different. O

Everything O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
delicious, O
salads, B-TARGET
soup, B-TARGET
lamb B-TARGET
sausage I-TARGET
is O
just O
a O
song. O

Pulka's B-TARGET
going O
to O
hooray! O

With O
a O
beer! O

Beer's B-TARGET
great, O
maybe O
it's O
not O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
but O
no O
one's O
got O
any O
taste O
in O
it, O
it's O
all O
fresh. O

All O
the O
guys O
were O
happy O
and O
full. O

Even O
our O
kid O
who O
was O
ordered O
dessert B-TARGET
also O
said O
it O
was O
delicious, O
so O
you O
can O
have O
a O
beer O
company O
and O
a O
family O
just O
to O
have O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
) O
) O
) O

For O
the O
first O
time, O
I O
wanted O
to O
write O
a O
review O
to O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
because O
I O
had O
a O
really O
nice O
impression... O

It's O
a O
very O
comfortable O
interior O
and O
a O
beautiful O
location, O
even O
though O
the O
building O
of O
the O
bank O
is O
next O
door O
to O
ruining O
the O
painting... O
but O
that's O
another O
question. O

From O
the O
kitchen, O
I've O
tasted O
two O
dishes. O
I'll O
dodge O
cookies O
and O
pasta O
with O
spinach. O

Dorada B-TARGET
was O
worthy, O
very O
fond O
of O
the O
sauce, B-TARGET
which O
is O
80% O
of O
the O
success O
of O
the O
meal. O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
less O
impressed, O
perhaps O
because O
it O
wasn't O
on O
the O
hungry O
stomach, O
and O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
wasn't O
perfectly O
gentle O
as O
it O
dreamed. O

It's B-TARGET
really O
not O
that O
big, O
but O
it's O
very O
neat O
and O
in O
the O
right O
amount. O
It's O
perfect O
to O
feel O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
dish, O
but O
not O
to O
be O
satisfied. O

The O
black B-TARGET
Caesar I-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
decent, O
made O
with O
taste. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
happy: O
when O
I O
was O
cleaned O
up O
by O
the O
fish O
- O
I O
was O
very O
pleased O
to O
be O
surprised O
- O
it's O
already O
level. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
the O
pineapples B-TARGET
for O
300 O
r O
have O
added O
sugar, O
if O
that's O
true, O
it's O
more O
like O
minus O
because O
it O
kills O
all O
natural O
taste... O

In O
general, O
staff B-TARGET
members I-TARGET
were O
clearly O
prepared O
for O
continuous O
improvement O
and O
respected O
their O
client. O

That's O
what O
bribes O
me O
the O
most. O

I O
want O
to O
go O
back O
and O
try O
a O
couple O
of O
desserts O
and O
some O
sponge O
soup... O
for O
starters. O

I O
recommend O
a O
place O
for O
everyone, O
a O
restaurant O
that O
isn't O
ashamed O
to O
recommend. O

I've O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
place, O
and O
I O
thought O
I'd O
come O
to O
this O
sports O
bar O
to O
just O
take O
a O
day O
off O
and O
see O
something. O

I O
got O
Caesar's O
salad O
and O
Latte's O
coffee O
ice O
cream, O
as O
usual. O

It's O
a O
good O
thing O
when O
the O
bar O
can O
cook O
coffee B-TARGET
and O
it's O
tasty O
without O
burning O
it. O
Yeah, O
and O
everything O
else O
was O
done O
well O
and O
well, O
I O
got O
orders O
very O
quickly, O
considering O
that O
there O
were O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
there O
during O
the O
day. O

There O
was O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
rest O
and O
isolation. O

The O
right O
interior, B-TARGET
like O
a O
normal O
men's O
pub O
with O
adequate O
prices O
and O
beautiful O
waitresses. B-TARGET

The O
only O
minus O
for O
me O
is O
that O
the O
pub O
is O
pretty O
far O
away O
from O
home, O
but O
the O
benefits O
are O
much O
bigger, O
and O
now O
I O
know O
where O
to O
watch O
football O
and O
where O
I'll O
be O
at O
tonight) O

I've O
been O
wanting O
to O
visit O
this O
place O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

09.05.2014 O
booked O
a O
table O
on O
the O
phone O
two O
hours O
before O
the O
visit. O

However, O
there O
were O
many O
tables O
available. O

I'll O
be O
brief O
in O
my O
remarks. O

Kitchen: B-TARGET
tasty, O
all O
super O
10 O
points. O

Staff: B-TARGET
polite, O
friendly. O

The O
interior: B-TARGET
simple, O
neat, O
non-excessive. O

Amount O
of O
cheque: O
3,500-3700 O
(+ O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine). O

There's O
a O
room B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
non-smokers, I-TARGET
which O
is O
definitely O
important. O

The O
most O
unpleasant O
thing O
happened O
during O
the O
dinner O
itself! O

It O
was O
like O
a O
bad O
movie! O

My O
companion O
was O
brought O
a O
special O
dish, O
he O
was O
good O
at O
it, O
he O
beat O
it O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
his O
heart O
(as O
he O
loves O
it O
at O
home), O
he O
took O
a O
knife O
and O
a O
fork, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
running O
around O
saying, O
"You O
haven't O
made O
it O
yet?" O

Turns O
out O
the O
couple O
at O
the O
next O
table O
ordered O
the O
same O
dish O
and O
it O
was O
meant O
for O
them. O

And O
you O
won't O
believe O
it! O

After O
the O
food O
was O
taken O
from O
us, O
the O
dish O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
next O
table! O

There's O
no O
word! O

The O
mood O
for O
dinner O
tonight O
was O
ruffled. O

I O
know O
all O
people O
can O
be O
wrong. O

But! O

Both O
of O
us O
and O
that O
couple O
in O
this O
situation O
looked O
like O
idiots. O

'Cause O
you O
could O
apologize O
to O
that O
couple O
and O
ask O
them O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
while O
longer O
for O
the O
dish O
to O
be O
ready. O

I O
think O
that O
was O
the O
only O
way O
out. O

Will O
I O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again? O

Maybe, O
but O
only O
for O
lunch. O
