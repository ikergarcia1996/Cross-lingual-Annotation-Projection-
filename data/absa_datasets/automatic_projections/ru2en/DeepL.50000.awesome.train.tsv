Good O
afternoon. O

My O
name O
is O
Vlada! O

I O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
his O
friends O
celebrated O
a O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant O
the O
other O
day. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
the O
maitre B-TARGET
d' O
met O
us O
and O
walked O
us O
to O
a O
table O
that O
was O
perfect O
for O
us. O

It O
was O
in O
a O
cozy O
corner B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
main O
room, O
the B-TARGET
dim I-TARGET
light I-TARGET
is O
a O
major O
part O
of O
this O
restaurant O
there O
is O
no O
daylight O
which O
was O
a O
big O
plus O
for O
our O
birthday O
party! O

We O
just O
came O
in O
the O
afternoon O
at O
about O
four O
o'clock, O
so O
the O
evening O
was O
pleasantly O
prolonged...... O

For O
our O
small O
banquet O
we O
ordered O
a O
couple O
of O
nice O
dishes, B-TARGET
I O
ordered O
snails B-TARGET
which O
were O
very O
tasty O
and O
very O
inexpensive O
for O
about O
300 O
rubles, O
my O
boyfriend O
ordered O
meat B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill, O
which O
they O
have O
a O
lot, O
he O
usually O
does O
not O
like O
it, O
and O
here O
he O
liked O
it O
his O
friends O
also O
ordered O
a O
portion O
of O
different O
meat B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill O
and O
they O
liked O
it O
very O
much! O

Closer O
to O
the O
evening O
we O
were O
warned O
that O
there O
would O
be O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
we O
were O
so O
happy O
about O
this O
unexpected O
surprise, O
we O
just O
had O
time O
for O
dancing O
and O
here O
is O
accompanied O
by O
such O
a O
beautiful O
voice B-TARGET
of O
the O
soloist O
......! O

We O
were O
really O
happy O
with O
the O
evening O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone!) O

We O
were O
at O
Ditaia O
last O
week O
with O
a O
friend. O

We O
came O
by O
chance, O
we O
both O
hadn't O
been O
to O
Chinese O
restaurants O
before, O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
taste O
of O
what O
it O
is. O

Didn't O
know O
what O
to O
order, O
we O
just O
listened O
to O
our O
waitress' O
opinion. O

We O
were O
not O
disappointed O
at O
all! O

My O
friend O
was O
served O
pike-perch O
and O
I O
was O
served O
Peking O
pork. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
unusual. O

It O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
go O
and O
try O
something O
else.) O

As O
for O
the O
interior: B-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
quiet, O
no O
noisy O
companies O
(at O
least O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
visit), O
very O
nice O
and O
welcoming O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
all O
in O
the O
best O
traditions. O

Stayed O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
restaurant O
several O
times O
and O
can O
only O
say O
good O
things O
about O
the O
food. B-TARGET

Pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
delicious O
soups B-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
really O
good. O

During O
my O
last O
visit O
I O
was O
there O
with O
my O
friends O
and O
everyone O
was O
happy O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
there O
are O
several O
rooms B-TARGET
for O
different O
tastes O
and O
company. O

In O
general, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
for O
lunch O
and O
get-togethers O
with O
friends. O

Yesterday O
we O
had O
a O
birthday O
party O
at O
the O
restaurant O
and O
we O
went O
there O
two O
days O
beforehand O
to O
check O
it O
out. O

The O
two O
of O
us O
liked O
it O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
invite O
our O
guests O
there, O
one O
of O
whom O
was O
a O
big O
food O
connoisseur. O

I O
want O
to O
say O
right O
away O
that O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
criticize O
her O
because O
she O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
it, O
just O
like O
all O
the O
other O
guests! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
in O
a O
light O
French O
style O
with O
nice O
lighting B-TARGET
on O
the O
tables, O
service B-TARGET
without O
imposing O
extra O
food O
and O
drinks O
(waitress O
Anna), O
everything O
was O
accurate O
and O
fast. O

And O
about O
the O
quality B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
performance I-TARGET
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
there O
is O
nothing O
to O
talk O
about! O

Took O
all O
the O
different O
salads B-TARGET
and O
hot, B-TARGET
and O
all O
were O
very O
pleased O
(and O
fish, B-TARGET
and O
meat B-TARGET
and O
poultry). B-TARGET

All O
beautifully O
decorated O
and O
cooked O
right O
before O
serving. O

I O
think O
that O
this O
hitherto O
unknown O
to O
us O
in O
the O
city O
center O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Veritas". I-TARGET
Will O
become O
our O
family O
meeting O
place! O

Now O
if O
our O
acquaintances O
ask O
us O
"What O
restaurant O
to O
go O
with O
our O
guests O
from O
Moscow O
or O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday? O

Thanks O
a O
lot O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
for O
a O
hearty O
and O
high O
quality O
reception. B-TARGET

We O
wish O
you O
much O
success O
in O
the O
future! O

We O
came O
to O
this O
restaurant O
on O
25.08.12. O

After O
having O
visited O
it O
again O
there O
is O
no O
desire O
to O
come O
back. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
mistakes O
in O
waiters B-TARGET
work O
as O
well O
as O
in O
dishes. B-TARGET
1. O

There O
was O
a O
child. O
We O
ordered O
pizza O
from O
the O
children's O
menu. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
(once O
again O
- O
from O
children's O
menu!) O
was O
so O
spicy O
that O
even O
adults O
were O
not O
able O
to O
eat O
it, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
child. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
generally O
commented O
that O
the O
children's O
menu O
is O
for O
adults O
who O
want O
to O
order O
small O
portions, O
not O
for O
children. O
:)) O
2. O

Asked O
to O
bring O
the O
usual O
apple O
juice, O
not O
freshly O
squeezed, O
brought O
freshly O
squeezed, O
had O
to O
return. O
3. O

3. O
We O
were O
asked O
to O
bring O
"fresh O
juice O
in O
a O
large O
glass O
+ O
sparkling O
water" O
Juice O
brought O
a O
small O
glass O
of O
water, O
but O
we O
forgot O
about O
the O
water. O
4. O

4. O
Asked O
the O
waiter O
to O
help O
us O
choose O
from O
2 O
dishes. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
said O
"we O
have O
everything O
delicious" O
and O
could O
not O
help O
with O
the O
choice. O

I O
rated O
3 O
for O
the O
food, B-TARGET
as O
we O
liked O
only O
panacotta B-TARGET
from O
the O
whole O
order. O

Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
not O
so O
good O
+ O
very O
spicy O
pizza B-TARGET
from O
the O
children's O
menu. O

For O
service B-TARGET
- O
3, O
because O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
mixing O
up O
the O
orders O
and O
could O
not O
help O
with O
the O
choice O
(or O
did O
not O
want O
to, O
when O
a O
client O
asks O
for O
help O
to O
decide, O
he O
does O
not O
want O
to O
hear O
"all O
delicious, O
take O
it O
all"). O

And O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
children's O
menu O
is O
not O
for O
children, O
"killed". O

From O
the O
pluses O
I O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
the O
babysitter B-TARGET
in O
the O
nursery, O
a O
very O
nice O
girl, B-TARGET
the O
child O
really O
liked O
it. O

I O
didn't O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
when O
I O
was O
a O
kid, O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
it O
was O
then O
but O
now O
it's O
a O
nice O
and O
cozy O
place B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
cuisine. B-TARGET

For O
the O
first O
time O
we O
visited O
"Cheburek" O
a O
month O
ago: O
we O
were O
celebrating O
with O
friends O
a O
wedding O
that O
had O
taken O
place O
before. O

Administration B-TARGET
kindly O
gave O
us O
a O
new O
banquet O
hall O
where O
we O
closed O
and O
played O
our O
music, O
smoked O
hookah, O
had O
fun O
and O
nobody O
bothered O
us. O

All O
my O
friends O
liked O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
(the B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
were O
wonderful). O

What O
made O
me O
happy O
most O
of O
all O
was O
that O
the O
administration B-TARGET
agreed O
to O
meet O
us O
halfway O
and O
gave O
us O
a O
good O
discount O
for O
the O
banquet O
:) O

In O
a O
week O
my O
friend O
went O
back O
to O
"Cheburek" B-TARGET
with O
her O
family O
where O
they O
celebrated O
my O
father's O
anniversary. O

We O
also O
come O
back O
here O
again O
and O
again. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
frustrating O
is O
the O
price O
increase. O

In O
the O
last O
month, O
the O
prices O
have O
already O
changed O
twice. O

They O
are O
growing O
a O
little, O
but O
still O
the O
cost O
of O
dinner B-TARGET
for O
two O
we O
had O
for O
each O
visit O
was O
higher O
and O
higher O
:) O

But O
without O
it, O
of O
course, O
nowhere. O

From O
the O
cuisine O
I O
can O
recommend: O
chebureks B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
suluguni I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
greens I-TARGET
(magic!), O
satsivi B-TARGET
with O
eggplant, O
chanakhi B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
khinkali, B-TARGET
and, O
probably, O
lamb B-TARGET
shanks I-TARGET
(I O
do O
not O
remember O
the O
exact O
name O
of O
the O
dish). O

It O
will O
not O
leave O
anybody O
indifferent, O
very O
delicious O
and O
"authentic"). O

I O
visited O
this O
place O
about O
five O
times. O

I O
came O
back O
there O
only O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good. O

Carpaccio O
is O
served O
with O
all O
sorts O
of O
balsamic O
and O
butter. O

Good O
choice O
of O
wines. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice: O
there O
is O
a O
checkroom, B-TARGET
sofas, B-TARGET
dim O
light, O
unobtrusive O
music B-TARGET
(even O
once O
came O
across O
a O
saxophonist), O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
... O

BUT! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
disgusting! O

Will O
always O
remember O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
addressed O
us O
using O
the O
word O
"you" O
and O
was O
flippant, O
and O
when O
we O
were O
reprimanded O
he O
told O
us O
that O
he O
had O
had O
a O
fight O
with O
his O
girlfriend O
and O
was O
in O
a O
bad O
mood! O

Another O
time O
we O
were O
"lucky" O
just O
as O
much. O

My O
husband O
ordered O
steak O
and O
we O
honestly O
waited O
over O
an O
hour O
for O
it O
to O
arrive! O

When O
our O
waitress B-TARGET
actually O
deigned O
to O
come O
(we O
were O
sitting O
almost O
at O
the O
entrance) O
we O
refused O
the O
steak, O
but O
it O
still O
magically O
appeared O
on O
the O
table O
in O
5 O
minutes O
and O
we O
had O
to O
explain O
to O
the O
waitress O
that O
no O
one O
would O
eat O
it... O

In O
short O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
great O
and O
the O
prices O
don't O
bite, O
but O
you O
should O
seriously O
think O
about O
the O
staff B-TARGET
replacement... O

On O
Saturday O
night O
we O
were O
in O
the O
Dolce O
Italy O
Cafe O
with O
a O
group, O
drinking O
coffee O
and O
pastries. O

It O
was O
only O
fifteen O
to O
nine, O
and O
the O
cafe, O
as O
it O
turned O
out, O
closes O
at O
9 O
pm O
sharp. O

We O
were O
kindly O
offered O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
and O
the O
pastries O
were O
promised O
to O
bring O
us O
there. O

And O
so O
we O
got O
acquainted O
with O
the O
restaurant O
Italy. O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
and O
a O
full O
house. O

The O
restaurant O
only O
managed O
to O
find O
a O
table O
for O
smokers, O
but O
it O
didn't O
bother O
us O
much O
as O
the B-TARGET
ventilation I-TARGET
is O
fine. O

We O
liked O
the O
food O
we O
ordered. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quiet, O
tastefully O
done, O
but O
without O
any O
frills. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
this O
was O
more O
suitable O
for O
a O
company O
than O
for O
a O
couple. O

As O
for O
service, B-TARGET
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
forgot O
about O
us O
at O
the O
beginning O
and O
had O
to O
stop O
to O
order. O

But O
other O
than O
that, O
everything O
was O
polite O
and O
courteous. O

We O
needed O
sauce O
without O
anchovies O
to O
our O
Caesar O
salad. O

At O
first O
the O
cook B-TARGET
said O
that O
they O
can O
only O
offer O
mayonnaise, B-TARGET
and O
that O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
the O
same O
for O
everyone O
in O
the O
morning. O

Ten O
minutes O
later O
he O
came O
running O
again O
and O
promised O
to O
make O
everything O
in O
the O
best O
way. O

Anyway, O
we O
will O
go O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
again. O

We O
will O
definitely O
try O
more O
Italian O
dishes. O

For O
a O
long O
time, O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
have O
wanted O
to O
find O
a O
good O
Italian O
restaurant. O

What O
if O
Italy O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
just O
that? O
:) O

Stopped O
by O
for O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago. O

Did O
not O
book O
a O
table. O

Nothing O
negative O
can O
be O
said O
about O
the O
service B-TARGET
- O
quick O
response, O
everyone O
smiles, O
comes O
up O
to O
ask O
if O
you O
like O
everything. O

Pleasant. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
to O
your O
liking, O
but O
nice O
and O
comfortable. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good. O

Tasty, O
not O
too O
expensive. O

The O
serving B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
pilaf I-TARGET
is O
original, O
but... O

I O
personally O
did O
not O
like O
it, O
although O
the O
idea O
is O
certainly O
not O
bad. O

The O
girls O
clearly O
like O
it. O

I O
personally O
expected O
a O
little O
more O
meat B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
at O
such O
a O
restaurant O
on O
the O
grill. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
there O
is O
one O
shashlik B-TARGET
of O
each O
kind O
of O
meat, O
in O
principle O
enough, O
but O
I O
want O
to O
see O
something O
unusual. O

My O
first O
visit O
to O
Dacha O
was O
in O
search O
of O
a O
restaurant O
for O
a O
wedding O
banquet. O

Right O
from O
the O
very O
threshold O
we O
were O
welcomed. B-TARGET

Very O
polite O
and O
pleasant O
man B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
checkroom. O

A O
smile, O
the O
mood O
improves! O

He O
called O
our O
manager, B-TARGET
pleasant O
girl, B-TARGET
told O
us O
everything, O
showed O
us O
everything, O
no O
questions, O
even O
looked O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
our O
eyes O
in O
the O
small O
room O
(at O
this O
time O
there O
started O
the O
banquet). O

We O
left O
our O
coordinates O
and O
we O
received O
the O
menu O
the O
same O
evening. O

Waitresses B-TARGET
greeted O
us O
and O
smiled O
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
amazing. O

Decided O
to O
come O
back O
for O
dinner. O

Again O
a O
cordial O
greeting B-TARGET
in O
the O
checkroom. O

Comes O
as O
a O
pleasant O
compliment O
in O
the O
cold O
weather, O
we O
had O
a O
hot O
tea B-TARGET
while O
waiting O
for O
our O
order, O
amazing! O

A B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
(the O
check O
was O
written O
Louise) O
polite, O
unobtrusive, O
quality O
service. B-TARGET

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
very O
good! O

The O
meat B-TARGET
from O
their O
smokehouse O
is O
amazing, O
yummy! O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
large. O

We O
were O
very O
pleased! O

No O
doubts O
about O
the O
choice O
of O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
our O
wedding, O
I O
hope O
that O
on O
the O
most O
important O
day O
of O
our O
life O
we O
will O
be O
satisfied O
too, O
this O
week O
we O
are O
going O
to O
book O
it O
:). O

I O
recommend O
everyone O
to O
go O
to O
this O
wonderful O
place! B-TARGET

I O
went O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time O
today O
with O
my O
boyfriend. O

I O
can O
say O
one O
thing O
- O
found O
a O
place B-TARGET
worth O
going O
and O
spend O
time O
in O
a O
quiet O
and O
comfortable O
environment. B-TARGET

Really O
lovely, O
romantic O
candles B-TARGET
in O
the O

Japanese B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
- O
on O
5 O
+ O
... O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
come O
away O
from O
the O
purchased B-TARGET
rolls) I-TARGET

European B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
not O
far O
behind...) O
all O
the O
top O
shelf. O
For O
fairly O
low O
prices O
are O
very O
tasty.And O
service... B-TARGET
nice O
girl, B-TARGET
very O
quickly O
brought O
your O
order, O
all O
great. O

In O
general, O
the O
conclusion O
is O
one O
- O
and O
still O
there O
will O
come O
and O
not O
once! O

We O
had O
our O
first O
visit O
to O
this O
restaurant O
on O
St. O
Valentine's O
Day, O
we O
really O
liked O
the O
video O
clip O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
we O
decided O
to O
go. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
at O
a O
high O
level, O
at O
the O
entrance O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
met O
us O
and O
offered O
to O
choose O
our O
table O
and O
warned O
us O
that O
the O
hot O
meal O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
longer O
as O
the O
restaurant O
was O
not O
a O
few O
people, O
but O
we O
were O
not O
confused, O
as O
we O
have O
been O
warned, O
and O
this O
is O
not O
unimportant. O

The B-TARGET
quality I-TARGET
of O
food O
had O
no O
remarks, O
and O
service B-TARGET
was O
fairly O
attentive O
in O
our O
opinion, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
obvious O
that O
some O
fuss O
was O
present. O

Overall, O
we O
were O
very O
impressed O
with O
the O
food. O

Thank O
you O

Yesterday, O
Monday, O
February O
14, O
went O
to O
the O
place O
which O
was O
previously O
unknown O
to O
me. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
cozy. O

There O
is, O
of O
course, O
as O
in O
every O
cafe O
and O
tables O
that O
can O
not O
be O
called O
cozy, O
but O
you O
can O
not O
please O
everyone O
and O
in O
general O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

You O
can O
see O
at O
once O
that O
they O
took O
as O
much O
care O
as O
possible O
to O
the O
interior B-TARGET
and O
it O
pleases O
me. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
and O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
polite. O

The O
cafe O
staff B-TARGET
made O
it O
clear O
that O
people O
want O
to O
work O
and O
like O
that, O
and O
that's O
the O
most O
important O
thing!) O

There O
were O
no O
delays O
in O
serving O
food/drinks. O

The O
only O
surprise O
was O
when O
for O
dessert O
they O
brought O
me O
a O
spoon O
instead O
of O
a O
dessert O
fork, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
cause O
a O
problem. O

But O
you O
would O
have O
tasted O
this O
dessert B-TARGET
m.m.m. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
we O
loved O
it) O

The O
sushi B-TARGET
breaded I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
breadcrumbs I-TARGET
or O
whatever O
caused O
a O
lot O
of O
admiration, O
as O
it O
was O
really O
delicious. O

In O
terms O
of O
cuisine B-TARGET
we O
can O
say O
that O
this O
is O
a O
cafe B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
like O
value O
for O
money. O

There O
is O
everything O
you O
need. O

In O
general, O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
leaves O
very O
pleasant O
memories. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
go O
and O
try O
the O
local O
Japanese B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

On O
the O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
on O
couches B-TARGET
is O
very O
comfortable O
to O
sit O
a O
company. O

Recently O
we O
had O
a O
birthday O
party O
at O
Sanam. O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

The O
guests O
loved O
it. O

Lovely O
interior, B-TARGET
good O
service, B-TARGET
fast O
and O
unobtrusive. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
really O
good. O

There O
are O
oriental, O
European O
and O
Japanese O
dishes. B-TARGET

Since O
we O
all O
had O
different O
tastes O
it O
was O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
dish B-TARGET
to O
suit O
everybody. O

There O
were O
big O
portions B-TARGET
and O
everything O
was O
very O
delicious. O

Really O
enjoyed O
the O
hookah. B-TARGET

There O
was O
also O
a O
big O
choice O
of O
cocktails B-TARGET
and O
some O
of O
them O
were O
really O
good. O

I O
particularly O
liked O
the O
orgasm B-TARGET
and O
the O
strawberry B-TARGET
margarita. I-TARGET

Overall O
we O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
room O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
interested. O

We O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
a O
Chinese O
restaurant O
not O
far O
from O
our O
house, O
the O
closest O
one O
was O
Zhen-Zhen. O

At O
first O
sight O
from O
the O
street O
we O
could O
see O
Chinese O
attributes. O

On O
the O
first O
floor O
there O
was O
a O
dancing O
area O
and O
European O
pop O
music O
and O
we O
were O
asked O
to O
go O
to O
the O
second O
floor. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
"Chinese B-TARGET
interior" I-TARGET
- O
sofas B-TARGET
as O
in O
a O
bistro, O
tablecloths B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
tables I-TARGET
on O
the O
type O
a O
la O
dining O
room, O
European O
lamps O
/ O
chandeliers, O
in O
general O
in O
terms O
of O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
Chinese O
absolutely O
none! O

In O
general, O
in O
terms O
of O
interior, B-TARGET
there O
is O
absolutely O
no O
Chinese O
whatsoever. O

Well, O
as O
we O
had O
no O
strength O
to O
go O
somewhere O
else, O
we O
decided O
to O
order O
some O
food. O

We B-TARGET
were O
not O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
menu O
- O
only O
printed O
cards, O
the O
composition B-TARGET
and O
weight O
of O
the O
dishes O
were O
not O
particularly O
clear, O
pictures O
were O
out O
of O
the O
question. O

Well O
well O
- O
we O
are O
acquainted O
with O
the O
Chinese O
cuisine O
- O
we O
ordered O
beef, B-TARGET
pork, B-TARGET
rice, B-TARGET
a O
couple O
of O
snacks, B-TARGET
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
large, O
the O
food B-TARGET
- O
delicious, O
they O
brought O
everything O
hot. O

Of O
course O
the O
tableware B-TARGET
and O
presentation B-TARGET
could O
have O
been O
better. O

As O
to O
service O
- O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
didn't O
say O
hello, O
we O
didn't O
have O
time O
to O
sit O
down O
- O
she O
came O
for O
the O
order, O
though O
the O
dishes O
were O
brought O
out O
quickly, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
bill.... O
though O
only O
2 O
tables O
were O
occupied O
except O
us. O

I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
for O
a O
second O
time O
- O
I O
like O
the O
Chinese O
atmosphere O
in O
such O
places. O

Recently O
I O
found O
out O
about O
the O
restaurant O
"Mamalyga" O
from O
my O
friends. O

On O
Sunday O
evening O
I O
decided O
to O
visit O
it. O

Entered O
the O
restaurant, O
where O
we O
are O
greeted O
by O
a O
friendly, O
beautiful O
girl. B-TARGET

She O
takes O
us O
to O
the O
table, O
indicates O
where O
you O
can O
leave O
your O
clothes. O

(There O
is O
no O
checkroom, O
but O
there O
are O
floor O
hangers). O
In O
a O
few O
minutes O
we O
were O
approached O
by O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
with O
a O
menu. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice! O

It O
was O
an O
unusual O
and O
interesting O
design. B-TARGET

All O
the O
details O
are O
thought O
out O
in O
detail O
and O
together O
create O
a O
wonderful O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
warmth O
and O
comfort. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
looked O
good O
and O
was O
easy O
to O
read. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
special O
offer. O

The O
prices O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
know O
the O
menu, O
work O
harmoniously O
and O
are O
attentive O
to O
the O
guests. O

Smile, O
which O
is O
always O
nice. O
In O
a O
word O
service B-TARGET
10 O
points O
to O
pick O
on O
nothing O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
large O
number O
of O
guests. O

Cooked O
long, O
but O
not O
critical. O
(Maybe O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
institution O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
guests). O

Cooked O
very O
tasty, O
especially O
kebabs B-TARGET
and O
napoleon B-TARGET
(thanks O
a O
lot O
chefs). O

And O
yet O
a O
great O
Caucasian B-TARGET
bazaar. I-TARGET

I O
bought O
some O
fruit O
before O
I O
left O
(very O
tasty). O

Thanks O
to O
the O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
we O
were O
very O
satisfied O
and O
had O
a O
great O
evening! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
will O
visit O
your O
place B-TARGET
often O
now O
!!!!. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants. B-TARGET

Since O
the O
opening O
I've O
been O
visiting O
it, O
because O
I O
used O
to O
live O
close O
by. O

When O
opening O
a O
discount O
card O
gave O
me O
20% O
as O
a O
gift, O
and O
it O
became O
a O
motivation O
to O
visit O
often. O

Always O
tasty: O
borscht B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
smoked I-TARGET
meat, I-TARGET
rolls B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill, O
delicious O
Philly. B-TARGET

My O
boyfriend O
was O
skeptical O
about O
my O
reviews O
until O
I O
took O
him O
there. O

Had O
the O
ribeye B-TARGET
, O
after O
which O
we O
concluded O
that O
it O
was O
better O
than O
some O
steakhouses. O

The O
beloved O
Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
was O
also O
good. O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
large, O
beautiful O
plates B-TARGET
and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

On O
the O
service B-TARGET
separately: O
there O
are O
waiters B-TARGET
who O
work O
since O
the O
opening-it's O
also O
a O
good O
indicator O
of O
quality. O

The B-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
also O
from O
the O
opening. O

Even O
a O
business B-TARGET
lunch I-TARGET
is O
good. O

I O
can't O
say O
anything O
about O
desserts O
- O
I O
haven't O
tried O
them. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
quiet, O
in O
beige O
and O
brown O
colors, O
but O
not O
cheap, O
so O
you O
can't O
say O
that O
this O
is O
a O
cafe O
in O
the O
"middle O
of O
nowhere". O

And O
in O
this O
place B-TARGET
has O
never O
been O
a O
disappointment O
all O
the O
time, O
I'm O
not O
lying! O

This O
is O
not O
an O
advertisement O
of O
the O
institution B-TARGET
and O
not O
some O
kind O
of O
PR, O
as O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
this O
institution. O

Just O
wanted O
to O
say O
THANK O
YOU! O

I O
would O
like O
you O
to O
be O
located O
closer O
to O
the O
center O
or O
in O
the O
very O
center, O
as O
I O
live O
in O
the O
center O
already. O

Wish: O
stay O
on O
the O
same O
level! O

Random O
review. O

Random O
because O
it O
was O
the O
only O
time. O

Went O
in O
not O
a O
large O
group O
on O
February O
5, O
in O
the O
evening. O

Meet O
and O
greet O
with O
the O
entire O
cast. O

Smile, O
offer O
to O
try O
everything O
on O
the O
menu. O

You've O
already O
had O
one O
dessert, O
so O
what, O
have O
another. O

They O
are O
extremely O
friendly. O

They O
tell O
you O
what's O
on O
the O
menu O
and O
give O
advice. O

They O
bring O
and O
deliver O
food O
and O
serve O
it O
well, O
even O
when O
the O
place O
is O
almost O
fully O
crowded. O

Of O
the O
minor O
drawbacks O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
we O
were O
waiting O
a O
long O
time O
for O
food, O
but O
our O
waitress B-TARGET
smoothed O
all O
the O
angles. O

As O
a O
result, O
the O
evening O
was O
a O
success O
thanks O
to O
Polenta. B-TARGET

I've O
been O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
recently O
on O
friends' O
recommendations. O

I O
found O
the O
menu B-TARGET
interesting O
and O
was O
particularly O
pleased O
with O
the O
price-quality O
ratio. O

I O
liked O
the O
soup B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
bread, I-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
unusual O
and O
tasty. O

Nice O
interior, B-TARGET
smiling O
staff B-TARGET
and O
a O
cosy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

In O
addition, O
one O
of O
the O
rooms O
has O
a O
children's B-TARGET
corner! I-TARGET

So O
it's O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
not O
only O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
have O
tasty O
and O
inexpensive O
meal O
but O
also O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
have O
a O
rest O
with O
whole O
family))). O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
yesterday, O
celebrating O
half O
a O
year O
of O
married O
life. O

Heard O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
reviews O
about O
the O
high O
quality O
of O
service O
and O
perfect O
cuisine. O

So O
I O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
as O
on O
a O
holiday. O

Were O
in O
many O
restaurants O
in O
St O
Petersburg O
and O
other O
countries. O

I O
do O
not O
have O
any O
complaints O
about O
service, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
excellent O
(of O
course O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
but O
I O
can O
wait O
for O
good O
food) O
and O
I O
like O
this O
kind O
of O
interior B-TARGET
design I-TARGET
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
terrible O
(it O
can O
be O
just O
our O
bad O
luck). O

Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
the O
whole O
plate O
is O
lettuce, B-TARGET
a O
little O
bacon B-TARGET
in O
a O
circle O
and O
it's O
all O
in O
a O
sauce, B-TARGET
on O
top O
of O
cheese B-TARGET
(Caesar O
is O
made O
with O
chicken). O

Then O
there O
were O
scallops B-TARGET
like O
nothing, O
but O
it O
gave O
away O
the O
vinegar, B-TARGET
the O
mashed O
potatoes B-TARGET
with O
it O
was O
over-salted. O

The O
last O
course O
was O
veal O
and O
potato O
cutlet O
to O
it, O
the O
veal B-TARGET
also O
gave O
back O
vinegar O
in O
the O
potato B-TARGET
cutlet I-TARGET
was O
a O
hair O
or O
animal O
or O
human. O

The O
waiter O
was O
given O
that O
hair. O

We O
got O
the O
bill O
with O
a O
10% O
discount, B-TARGET
probably O
because O
of O
the O
hair. O

In O
general, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
very O
hungry, O
I O
ate O
a O
spoonful O
of O
each O
dish. B-TARGET

My O
husband O
ordered O
snails B-TARGET
and O
beef, B-TARGET
and O
the O
same O
thing O
reeked O
of O
vinegar. O

We O
were O
not O
satisfied. O

Unfortunately O
we O
did O
not O
get O
to O
try O
the O
famous O
oysters, B-TARGET
they O
ran O
out. O

Freshly B-TARGET
squeezed I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
and O
bread B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
(I O
have O
never O
had O
such O
bread). B-TARGET

Anyway, O
we O
went, O
we O
looked, O
we O
ate... O

We O
will O
not O
go O
again. O

I O
have O
not O
been O
in O
such O
a O
horrible O
place B-TARGET
in O
a O
long O
time. O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
is O
just O
out O
of O
the O
question, O
the B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
just O
don't O
pay O
any O
attention O
to O
you, O
and O
if O
they O
do O
manage O
to O
catch O
somebody, O
they O
look O
at O
you O
with O
that O
expression O
on O
their O
face... O
"ah, O
you O
also O
have O
to O
bring O
something...". O

As O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
itself O
- O
not O
a O
single O
dish B-TARGET
caused O
admiration. O

By O
virtue O
of O
circumstances, O
I O
was O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
more O
than O
once, O
but O
somehow O
each O
time O
I O
am O
convinced O
of O
my O
first O
impression. O

Once O
when O
ordering O
soup B-TARGET
from O
the O
menu O
the O
waitress O
said O
that O
we O
should O
order O
a O
different O
one O
as O
it O
was O
sour O
(!!!). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
dark, O
not O
everyone O
will O
also O
be O
to O
his O
liking. O

In O
general, O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
going O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

There O
are O
quite O
a O
few O
better O
quality O
establishments O
on O
the O
same O
street. O

Hello!!! O

Visited O
Twin's B-TARGET
yesterday O
with O
a O
friend, O
overall O
really O
liked O
it!!! O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
(I O
think O
Eugene) O
was O
wonderful: O
he O
met O
us, O
sat O
us O
down, O
gave O
us O
the O
menu O
right O
away, O
asked O
if O
we O
could O
bring O
some O
drinks O
and O
if O
we O
liked O
the O
food, O
and O
in O
general O
he O
showed O
up O
the O
whole O
evening O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
needed O
it! O

I O
can't O
say O
anything O
bad O
about O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
it O
was O
the O
usual! O

We O
ordered O
2 O
america O
maki, O
chukka O
salad O
and O
strawberry O
tea O
in O
a O
teapot. O

America B-TARGET
- O
tasted O
good O
but O
not O
much O
fish, B-TARGET
chukka B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
- O
good, O
tea B-TARGET
- O
did O
not O
like O
it!!! O

The O
evening O
was O
satisfactory, O
you O
can O
go O
next O
time O
before O
the O
club O
to O
try O
the O
cocktails!!!) O

Several O
times O
we O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
with O
friends! O

In O
general, O
very O
good! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
everything O
in O
moderation! O

Liked O
the O
food! B-TARGET

Last O
time O
we O
visited O
was O
on O
January O
21. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
group O
of O
5 O
people. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
music B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
and O
the O
good O
music. B-TARGET

No O
claims O
about O
service, B-TARGET
good O
welcoming O
and O
waiting O
for O
a O
table O
(booked O
VIP O
zone, O
price O
400 O
rubles). O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
didn't O
make O
us O
wait O
long, O
very O
polite O
and O
nice! O

It's O
a O
really O
nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
be! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
only O
once O
but O
would O
love O
to O
go O
there O
again. O

I O
had O
dinner O
with O
my O
sister O
on O
the O
2nd O
floor. O

Great O
service, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
brought O
quickly O
and O
polite. O

I O
liked O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
decide O
what O
to O
order O
because O
of O
the O
large O
variety B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
things I-TARGET
to O
eat. O

It O
was O
really O
good O
and O
we O
didn't O
have O
any O
bad O
comments O
about O
the O
food. B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
musical O
guests O
coming O
over O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
our O
evening. O

We O
liked O
their O
music. B-TARGET

Beautiful, O
but O
unobtrusive. O

I O
would O
love O
to O
go O
again O
and O
again! O

Frost O
and O
sunshine, O
it's O
a O
beautiful O
day! O

I O
wanted O
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
a O
view O
on O
Finnish. O

Went O
to O
More! O

We O
know O
about O
the O
100 O
p O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
the O
bad O
road...it's B-TARGET
bearable. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
space: B-TARGET
no O
one O
bothers O
anyone, O
a O
large O
aquarium B-TARGET
with O
beautiful O
fish O
smiled, O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
people, O
and O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
were O
friendly. O

Floor-to-ceiling O
windows B-TARGET
- O
the O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
bay O
is O
just O
magical!!! O

Prices O
are O
in O
line O
with O
this O
place. B-TARGET

Coffee B-TARGET
and O
tea B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mint I-TARGET
- O
delicious. O

We O
had O
tuna B-TARGET
Caesar I-TARGET
(very O
tasty O
tuna), B-TARGET
mashed B-TARGET
potato I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
(followed O
by O
a O
berry B-TARGET
sorbet I-TARGET
as O
a O
must-have O
compliment) O
and O
seafood B-TARGET
pasta, I-TARGET
all O
very O
tasty. O

I O
ordered O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
for O
dessert I-TARGET
and O
I O
was O
very O
happy O
with O
it! O

I've O
never O
had O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
this I-TARGET
good I-TARGET
in O
a O
long O
time! O

They O
serve O
quickly. O

I O
didn't O
see O
any O
minuses. O

When O
they O
brought O
the O
bill, O
we O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised: O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
on O
weekends O
the O
bill O
is O
50% O
cheaper O
from O
1 O
to O
5 O
pm, O
and O
we O
thought O
the O
waiters O
made O
a O
mistake O
in O
our O
favor))) O

Bread B-TARGET
basket I-TARGET
was O
nice, O
and O
by O
the O
way, O
it's O
free. O

All O
in O
all, O
and O
for O
two O
romantic O
and O
fun O
company O
to O
sit O
there O
is O
quite O
nice. O

Looking O
forward O
to O
the O
summer O
to O
come O
to O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
. O

I O
was O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
in O
the O
pub, B-TARGET
really O
enjoyed O
it. O

Good O
beer B-TARGET
and O
cheese B-TARGET
sticks. I-TARGET

Good O
service B-TARGET
. O

Went O
twice O
with O
my O
husband O
in O
the O
restaurant O
as O
well. O

We O
celebrated O
his O
birthday. O

My O
husband O
is O
Spanish O
and O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Evaluates O
it O
on O
five O
points. O

For O
me O
the O
downside O
was O
that O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
themselves O
are O
too O
specific. O

With O
the O
addition O
of O
berries B-TARGET
or O
fruit B-TARGET
and O
too O
much O
spice B-TARGET
in O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
so O
it O
was O
unfortunately, O
personally, O
I O
had O
trouble O
finishing O
it. O

My O
husband O
finished O
it. O

And O
that's O
a O
pity. O

Because O
about O
the O
meat, O
that O
is O
steak, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
separately. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
not O
tried O
anywhere O
else O
such O
a O
well O
done O
steak. B-TARGET

Juicy, O
soft O
and O
cuts O
like O
butter. O

The O
level O
of O
cooking B-TARGET
is O
European. O

That O
said, O
my O
husband O
prefers O
his O
meat B-TARGET
semi-raw, I-TARGET
as O
he O
was O
served O
it, O
and O
I O
liked O
it O
well O
done. O

When O
we O
came O
the O
second O
time O
my O
husband O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
this, O
whether O
the O
cooks B-TARGET
have O
changed. O

But O
when O
he O
was O
convinced O
that O
the O
steak B-TARGET
was O
made O
just O
as O
good, O
he O
was O
satisfied. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
dish B-TARGET
tartare I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
raw I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
raw I-TARGET
egg. I-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
attentive, O
the O
ambiance B-TARGET
is O
beautiful. O

In O
general O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
of O
a O
high O
level. O

We O
have O
been O
regulars O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
more O
than O
a O
year. O

The O
main O
thing O
I O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
is O
the O
consistently O
high O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places B-TARGET
where O
you O
want O
to O
try O
everything O
at O
once. O

Must O
try O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls. B-TARGET

They O
are O
great, O
they O
are O
made O
quickly, O
always O
fresh O
and O
very O
tasty! O

An O
amazing O
peculiarity O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
chain I-TARGET
is O
that O
in O
other O
restaurants O
(Komendantsky, O
Petrogradskaya) O
the O
level O
of O
service B-TARGET
and O
cuisine B-TARGET
remains O
at O
the O
same O
level. O

This O
is O
especially O
evident O
if O
you O
are O
a O
regular O
visitor O
of O
Sticks O
or O
Eurasia.) O

The O
only O
negative O
thing O
I'd O
like O
to O
mention O
is O
that O
the O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
sometimes O
gets O
cold O
when O
the O
front O
door O
opens, O
but O
that's O
nothing O
serious. O

If O
you O
go O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time O
- O
be O
sure O
to O
try O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
batter I-TARGET
- O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city. O

But O
you O
can't O
get O
hot B-TARGET
one O
thing O
at O
a O
time. O

Sometimes O
they O
even O
bring O
it O
cold. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
sometimes O
they O
bring O
everything O
at O
once: O
both O
sushi O
and O
soup O
and O
dessert. O

I O
hope O
the O
quality O
of O
service B-TARGET
and O
cuisine B-TARGET
will O
be O
as O
high, O
all O
the O
same O
favorite O
restaurant! B-TARGET

After O
a O
walk O
with O
a O
friend O
decided O
to O
go O
for O
a O
snack, O
in O
this O
restaurant O
was O
the O
last O
time O
about O
4 O
years O
ago, O
I O
remember O
that O
the O
most O
delicious O
pizza B-TARGET
on O
a O
thin O
dough O
I O
had O
just O
in O
Da O
Albertone, O
but O
since O
then O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
visit O
this O
Italian O
place, O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
that O
they O
still O
exist, O
and O
developed. O

In O
general, O
the O
overall O
impression O
is O
quite O
pleasant. O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
immediately O
greeted O
by O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
and O
checkroom B-TARGET
attendant I-TARGET
and O
politely O
undressed O
and O
escorted O
us. O

Hall O
chose O
the O
one O
that O
is O
in O
the O
Japanese O
style. O

We O
ordered O
pasta O
carbonara O
and O
roll O
Philadelphia. O

And O
for O
dessert O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
tiramisu, O
of O
course. O

Carbonara. B-TARGET

Beautiful, O
flavorful, O
smoky O
- O
this O
pasta B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
I O
have O
tried O
so O
far!!! O

I O
only O
managed O
to O
try O
the O
Philly, B-TARGET
it O
was O
made O
perfectly, O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
salmon-Philadelphia-a O
little O
bit B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
rice, I-TARGET
I'll O
take O
it O
next O
time O
Dessert B-TARGET
Tiramisu I-TARGET
just O
melted O
in O
your O
mouth))) O

A O
classic O
tender O
cube. O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
nice O
- O
a O
warm, O
cozy O
and O
calm O
place. B-TARGET

The O
background O
music B-TARGET
did O
not O
disturb O
the O
conversation. O

The O
only O
downside O
- O
in O
the O
ladies B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
the O
feeling O
that O
it O
is O
not O
very O
often O
cleaned. O

The O
urn B-TARGET
is O
completely O
full. O

I O
am O
writing O
a O
review O
about O
Dacha O
restaurant.) O

Had O
a O
birthday O
party! O

There O
was O
a O
separate O
VIP O
room O
for O
14 O
people. O

There O
was O
enough O
room O
for O
everybody, O
the O
table B-TARGET
was O
perfectly O
served O
and O
it O
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
comfortable. O

I O
personally O
really O
like O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
guests O
were O
happy O
with O
it O
too. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
bad, O
but O
I O
expected O
more. O

For O
lunch O
many O
people O
ordered O
pork B-TARGET
shish I-TARGET
kebab I-TARGET
and O
veal B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sage, I-TARGET
but O
alas, O
both O
were O
pretty O
dry O
and O
not O
really O
tasty O
(((. O

But O
the O
fish B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
bacon I-TARGET
- O
pleased)))) O

There O
was O
nothing O
to O
write O
about O
salads, B-TARGET
not O
really... O

A O
cold B-TARGET
snack I-TARGET
- O
very O
edible. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
cake B-TARGET
with O
"cheesecake" O
in O
it, O
which O
I O
ordered O
but O
unfortunately O
was O
not O
very O
good)))) O

And O
for O
1800 O
rubles, O
I O
think O
we O
could O
have O
made O
it O
tastier O
and O
nicer O
and O
more O
beautiful. O

Here... O

And O
the O
soundtrack B-TARGET
is O
a O
separate O
story! O

Their O
equipment B-TARGET
did O
not O
want O
to O
work O
the O
way O
we O
wanted O
it O
to, O
and O
our O
CDs O
were O
not O
playable O
either. O

In O
short, O
the O
evening O
was O
marred O
by O
that! O

I O
wanted O
to O
dance, O
but O
alas... O

The O
service O
was O
good O
and O
the O
girls B-TARGET
were O
very O
nice. O

The O
food O
was O
nice O
and O
the O
girls O
were O
nice. O

Though O
we O
should O
make O
some O
improvements O
to O
the O
kitchen O
and O
buy O
newer O
equipment. O

I O
came O
to O
Dacha B-TARGET
twice O
and O
I O
will O
come O
again O
if O
there O
is O
any O
chance! O

The O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
interior O
and O
the O
interior O
again! O
The O
color B-TARGET
scheme I-TARGET
and O
every O
detail O
is O
amazing! O
Especially O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
now O
popular O
minimalism O
Dacha B-TARGET
is O
the O
most O
comfortable O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very O
beautiful O
place. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
perfect O
for O
a O
meeting O
with O
friends O
for O
tea O
and O
cakes B-TARGET
(by O
the O
way O
they O
are O
also O
excellent)), O
and O
for O
a O
romantic O
date O
when O
you O
want O
to O
enjoy O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
from O
communicating O
with O
your O
loved O
one, O
and O
for O
a O
small O
family O
celebration O
also O
would O
be O
perfect!!! O

It O
can O
be O
said O
that O
I O
have O
been O
there O
2 O
times O
and O
it O
depends O
on O
how O
lucky O
I O
am. O

I O
did O
not O
think O
that O
it O
would O
spoil O
the O
overall O
impression. O

I O
did O
not O
think O
that O
this O
would O
spoil O
the O
general O
impression. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great O
too O
- O
great O
combinations, O
good O
portions, B-TARGET
and O
everything O
was O
very O
tasty.) O

For O
me O
the O
pluses O
are O
a O
separate O
checkroom, B-TARGET
convenient O
zoning, B-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
the O
live O
chinchillas B-TARGET
that O
you O
can O
feed O
with O
rose O
petals)))) O
thank O
you! O

Visited O
the O
restaurant O
in O
early O
September O
in O
the O
company O
of O
an O
attractive O
companion. O

Overall O
impression O
was O
extremely O
positive: O
- O
Everything O
started O
by O
booking O
a O
table O
on O
the O
phone, O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
reserved O
a O
table O
with O
all O
my O
wishes. O

When O
we O
arrived, O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
friendly O
girl, B-TARGET
walked O
to O
our O
table O
and O
handed O
the O
menu. O

The O
table O
was O
by O
the O
window, O
with O
a O
soft O
sofa: B-TARGET
very O
cozy O
and O
comfortable. O

We O
made O
an O
order, O
everything O
was O
prepared O
very O
quickly: O
20 O
minutes O
later, O
everything O
was O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
mention O
the O
beautiful O
way O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were I-TARGET
served. I-TARGET

After O
the O
hot O
meal O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
recommended O
a O
delicious O
dessert B-TARGET
that O
we O
couldn't O
refuse. O

As O
a O
result O
we O
spent O
about O
2 O
hours O
in O
this O
place, B-TARGET
we O
had O
a O
wonderful O
dinner O
and O
socialized, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
cozy O
and O
romantic! O

The O
average O
bill O
per O
person O
came O
out O
to O
1000 O
rubles. O

We O
decided O
at O
once O
after O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
that O
we'll O
visit O
this O
place B-TARGET
again O
soon. O

Very O
interesting O
place) B-TARGET

Everything O
in O
one)A O
bar, O
a O
restaurant, O
a O
disco, O
karaoke, O
celebrations, O
watching O
soccer O
matches...Everything O
you O
can O
think O
of O
is O
Lunar O
Night) O

It's O
quite O
strange O
how O
such O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
was O
close O
to O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
city O
oh. O

I O
came O
here O
at O
11 O
pm, O
there O
was O
a O
checkroom, B-TARGET
but O
for O
some O
reason O
no O
one O
met O
me, O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes.) O

After O
that, O
a O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
came O
up, O
said O
hello, O
smiled, O
and O
apologized O
for O
the O
wait.) O

There O
are O
several O
rooms. O

I O
was O
offered O
a O
"live O
music"-that O
is, O
karaoke O
performed O
by O
guests O
and O
"disco"-music O
a O
la O
club O
3-4 O
years O
ago). O

I O
chose O
the O
hall O
for O
disco O
- O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
not O
loud, O
if O
something O
can O
make O
it O
quieter... O
I O
liked O
very O
much O
comfortable O
sofas B-TARGET
and O
table B-TARGET
setting. I-TARGET

The O
only O
minus O
was O
that O
it O
was O
a O
little O
chilly O
as O
the O
door O
and O
windows O
were O
blowing O
out. O

At O
11 O
pm, O
two O
tables O
were O
taken... O

Cozy, O
nothing O
to O
say! O

The O
kitchen... O

I O
ordered O
a O
pork O
shish O
kebab... O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
girl B-TARGET
could O
not O
really O
explain O
what O
kind O
of O
wine I-TARGET
she O
limited O
herself O
to O
only O
"well, O
it's O
good" O
... O
Yes, O
the O
white B-TARGET
semi-sweet I-TARGET
wine O
was O
very O
impressive))). O

Inexpensive, O
reasonable O
prices O
(250 O
for O
the O
barbecue B-TARGET
and O
150 O
for O
the O
wine) B-TARGET
for O
such O
a O
quality O
are O
happy... O
I O
will O
come O
here O
again... O
and O
not O
even O
once). O

Went O
there O
yesterday. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
unusual O
and O
appealing. O

And O
in O
the O
actual O
cafe B-TARGET
was O
very O
cold, O
although O
they O
have O
condos, O
they O
turned O
them O
on O
to O
the O
heat, O
only O
when O
we O
have O
persistently O
asked, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
save, O
my O
hands O
just O
froze! O

From O
the O
kitchen O
we O
ordered O
a O
pizza, B-TARGET
so..... O
Nothing O
special, O
you O
can O
eat, O
there O
was O
no O
dope, B-TARGET
nothing O
to O
add O
=( O

I O
wanted O
to O
order O
dessert O
too, O
but O
they O
had O
no O
fruit B-TARGET
either(((( O

Ordered O
tea, B-TARGET
it O
tasted O
like O
the O
cheapest O
tea. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
always O
somewhere O
to O
disappear, O
although O
the O
people O
were O
not O
at O
all. O

What O
else O
did O
not O
please O
us, O
is O
that O
the O
cooks O
go O
straight O
through O
the O
cafe, O
back O
and O
forth. O

In O
general O
- O
I O
was O
not O
happy O
with O
the O
place B-TARGET
and O
I O
will O
not O
go O
there O
again. O

I O
was O
there O
the O
last O
time O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
at O
4 O
o'clock! O

In O
general O
- O
I O
did O
not O
like O
it, O
I O
will O
go O
there O
again. O
Last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
about O
a O
month O
or O
so O
ago O
at O
4 O
o'clock. O
Tables O
were O
almost O
all O
occupied, O
soup B-TARGET
was O
not O
long O
and O
it O
was O
delicious, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
has O
never O
complained, O
they O
always O
bring O
a O
compliment O
from O
the O
chef, O
and O
as O
for O
spaghetti, B-TARGET
you O
can O
order O
half O
a O
portion O
if O
you O
do O
not O
really O
want O
to O
eat! O

As O
for O
spaghetti, O
you O
can O
order O
half O
a O
portion O
if O
you O
don't O
really O
want O
to O
eat. O
The O
restaurant O
is O
not O
very O
large, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
nice, O
everything O
is O
comfortable O
there! O

But O
there's O
a O
huge O
minus, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
on O
Uprising O
Street O
and O
unfortunately O
there O
is O
no O
place O
to O
park O
and O
it's O
very O
difficult O
to O
find O
a O
place O
even O
if O
it's O
nearby. O

On O
Sunday O
we O
went O
there O
with O
my O
girlfriend. O

We O
chose O
this O
restaurant O
because O
we O
lived O
close O
by. O

At O
first O
we O
didn't O
really O
impressed O
by O
the O
reviews, O
but O
we O
decided O
to O
check O
it O
out O
for O
ourselves. O

WE B-TARGET
REALLY I-TARGET
LIKED I-TARGET
IT! I-TARGET
! O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
were O
all O
in O
beautiful O
uniforms O
and O
very O
friendly. O

We O
ordered O
and O
waited. O

We O
got O
our O
beer O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes, O
and O
then O
the O
salads O
came. O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
at O
such O
a O
speed B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
service)))) I-TARGET

The O
salads B-TARGET
were O
amazing! O

I O
took O
the O
salad O
with O
smoked B-TARGET
eel I-TARGET
- O
GREAT! O

The O
portions B-TARGET
were O
very O
good. O

I O
ordered O
fish O
rolls O
and O
she O
brought O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
a O
mountain O
of O
salad! B-TARGET

Then O
we O
were O
served O
sorbet, B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
tasty O
too))))) O

We O
ordered O
dairy O
veal O
with O
side O
dish O
for O
lunch. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
just O
melted O
in O
your O
mouth... O

For O
dessert, O
unfortunately, O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
room O
in O
my O
stomach O
(((. O

That's O
why O
I O
can't O
say O
anything O
here. O

I O
haven't O
had O
such O
a O
pleasure O
to O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time! O

I O
liked O
everything O
- O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
service B-TARGET
and O
cuisine B-TARGET
at O
a O
high O
level! O

Definitely O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
will O
become O
one O
of O
my O
favorites)))). O

There O
is O
one O
minus O
though... O

There O
is O
no O
no O
smoking B-TARGET
area I-TARGET
(((. O

But O
it O
didn't O
smell O
like O
smoke O
(we O
were O
from O
16 O
to O
18h)! O

Thank O
you! O

I O
recently O
moved O
to O
Pushkin. O

I O
had O
no O
time O
to O
walk O
around O
the O
park, O
not O
to O
mention O
any O
restaurants. O

Recently O
I O
was O
lucky O
to O
get O
the O
time O
to O
go O
to O
the O
park O
in O
Catherine. O

The O
weather O
was O
terrible O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
hide O
in O
some O
cozy O
cafe. O

I O
went O
up O
to O
the O
first O
person O
I O
met O
and O
asked O
where O
I O
could O
find O
a O
good O
place O
for O
a O
coffee. O

Without O
doubting O
he O
answered O
that O
there O
was O
a O
wonderful O
cafe B-TARGET
"White I-TARGET
Rabbit" I-TARGET
on O
Moskovskaya O
street. O

Once O
I O
got O
there O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
very O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
I O
give O
due O
credit O
to O
the O
owners O
and O
the O
designer! B-TARGET

That O
day O
I O
had O
an O
Americano B-TARGET
(probably O
the O
most O
delicious) O
and O
philadelphia, B-TARGET
I O
was O
happy O
with O
it, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
fresh O
and O
the O
coffee B-TARGET
was O
fragrant! O

A O
week O
later, O
I O
went O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
ordered O
two O
steaks O
(striploin) O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
red O
wine. O

Such O
steaks B-TARGET
are O
rare O
to O
find O
in O
St. O
Petersburg, O
very O
tasty! O

All O
very O
pleased! O

By O
the O
way O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
you O
can't O
see O
them, O
but O
the O
plates O
disappear O
at O
once! O

I O
think O
to O
go O
to O
an O
Italian O
wine O
evening O
Novello. O

Thanks O
for O
such O
a O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
in O
Pushkin! O

Good O
luck! O

Wonderful O
place, B-TARGET
my O
husband O
and O
I O
just O
loved O
it! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
really O
delicious O
(portions B-TARGET
really O
less O
than O
in O
other O
Italian O
restaurants), O
but O
we O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
it, O
even O
stuffed O
ourselves, O
my O
husband O
praised O
the O
carpaccio B-TARGET
and O
I O
enjoyed O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
"three I-TARGET
chocolates". I-TARGET

We O
would O
especially O
like O
to O
mention O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
special O
thanks O
to O
our O
waiter B-TARGET
Maxim, O
it O
was O
very O
pleasant! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
here O
also O
pleased O
us, O
played O
a O
nice O
Italian B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
in O
general O
the O
highest O
rating O
for O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
please O
wait O
for O
us O
again, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come)))) O

Went O
to O
this O
place O
today. O

Cuisine B-TARGET
was O
ok, O
I O
would O
even O
say O
that O
everything O
was O
delicious. O

But O
there O
was O
one O
BUT... O

While O
the O
restaurant O
was O
almost O
empty O
order, O
I O
waited O
for O
over O
forty O
minutes O
plus O
one O
dessert O
waitress B-TARGET
completely O
forgot O
and O
brought O
it O
another O
20 O
minutes. O

And O
most O
of O
all O
I O
was O
surprised O
and O
did O
not O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
menu O
was O
written O
in O
the O
dessert O
ingredients, O
and O
the O
actual O
dish B-TARGET
of O
inegredient O
I O
have O
not O
found! O

So O
if O
you O
are O
going O
there O
for O
lunch O
or O
dinner, O
then O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
you O
can O
wait O
a O
very O
long O
time! O

But O
I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
husband O
at O
lunch, O
there O
were O
plenty O
of O
seats O
and O
they O
served O
quickly. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice O
and O
we O
liked O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

We O
couldn't O
wait O
for O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
then O
we O
brought O
our O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
sushi, B-TARGET
which O
were O
very O
tasty. O

They O
have O
a O
special O
offer O
on O
rolls O
and O
sushi O
until O
5 O
pm, O
50% O
off... O
so O
we O
ordered O
some... O

My O
husband O
quickly O
went O
sour, O
and O
I O
ordered O
another O
portion O
of O
rolls, B-TARGET
but, O
alas, O
not O
such O
delicious O
... O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
the O
intricate O
name, O
but O
were O
with O
green O
onions O
and O
black O
pepper O
... O
unpalatable, O
dry O
... O
but O
it's O
fine. O

Of O
all O
the O
Japanese B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
places I-TARGET
this O
is O
the O
best, O
we O
will O
go O
there O
again O
before O
November O
20...for O
a O
special O
offer!!!! O

The O
toilet B-TARGET
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
sofa O
))))))) O

Do O
not O
judge O
a O
man O
by O
his O
clothes... O
May O
9... O

Overcast O
but O
warm O
St. O
Petersburg O
evening... O

In O
the O
company O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
we O
decided O
to O
walk O
in O
the O
city O
center, O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
snack O
in O
Tefsi, O
because O
they O
were O
next O
door O
and O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
things. O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
met O
in O
astonishment, O
because O
we O
looked O
like O
teenagers), O
but O
as O
they O
say O
in O
our O
company O
"we O
can O
afford O
it"))). O

I O
will O
not O
speak O
about O
an O
interior B-TARGET
as O
probably O
all O
is O
written O
in O
the O
previous O
responses, O
I O
can O
tell O
one O
- O
liked, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
too O
pleased O
us O
- O
excellent O
khachapuri, B-TARGET
large O
khinkali, B-TARGET
but O
meat B-TARGET
a O
little O
bit O
dry, O
baked O
eggplants B-TARGET
excellent, I-TARGET
lulja I-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
lack O
of O
sauce, B-TARGET
and O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
did O
not O
offer O
to O
order O
it O
in O
addition. O

And O
that's O
the O
end O
of O
all O
good O
things, O
because O
the O
service B-TARGET
in O
this O
restaurant O
is O
zero, O
the O
dishes O
were O
not O
brought O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
I O
ate O
when O
all O
their O
other O
dishes O
had O
been O
eaten, O
dirty O
plates O
on O
the O
table O
were O
not O
removed, O
but O
most O
importantly, O
when O
they O
brought O
the O
change O
- O
there O
was O
no O
receipt, O
immediately O
all O
good O
impressions O
of O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
evaporated, O
of O
course O
nobody O
came O
up O
to O
us O
and O
when O
we O
were O
leaving O
nobody O
said O
goodbye O
to O
us. O

We O
didn't O
leave O
a O
tip O
as O
I O
think O
that O
staff B-TARGET
of O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
has O
already O
earned O
their O
"tea". O

We O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
on O
July O
31 O
at O
the O
restaurant O
Andante. O

We O
came O
to O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
restaurant O
thoroughly, O
there O
were O
many O
different O
suggestions, O
but O
we O
couldn't O
find O
anything O
better O
than O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Everything O
was O
perfect O
- O
from O
the O
first O
call O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
talking O
to O
the O
manager B-TARGET
to O
our O
gathering O
after O
the O
banquet. O

Always O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
at O
all O
times, O
in O
person O
and O
on O
the O
phone. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
several O
menu B-TARGET
options, O
for O
every O
budget, O
each O
of O
the O
menu, O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
everything, O
snacks, B-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cold, I-TARGET
hot B-TARGET
drinks. B-TARGET

My O
guests, O
and O
in O
fact O
we O
are O
young O
people O
were O
completely O
delighted!!!) O

Cuisine B-TARGET
super, O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
amazing, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
the O
best, O
great O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
restaurant! O

I O
recommend O
to O
all! O

Thanks O
to O
the O
administration! B-TARGET

We O
were O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time O
today! O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

There O
was O
a O
place O
on O
the O
sofas, O
and O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly, O
but O
unobtrusive, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
also O
relaxes O
you O
and O
you O
can O
talk O
to O
her. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
prompt, O
wait O
1-2 O
minutes O
for O
beer, O
toast O
slightly O
longer, O
beer B-TARGET
is O
great!!! O
I O
love O
it!!! O

The O
atmosphere O
is O
very O
cozy. O
I O
am O
glad O
that O
there O
is O
such O
a O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
close O
to O
home! O

Yesterday O
we O
celebrated O
my O
mom's O
birthday O
with O
6 O
people. O

We O
booked O
the O
table O
the O
day O
before O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
we O
agreed O
that O
before O
we O
came O
the O
snacks O
would O
be O
ready. O

We O
came O
a O
little O
bit O
earlier, O
but O
they O
were O
waiting O
for O
us O
:-) O

We O
liked O
the O
snacks B-TARGET
so O
much O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
everything O
we O
could O
and O
ordered O
them O
in O
some O
wild O
quantities, O
so O
unfortunately O
there O
was O
no O
room O
for O
hot O
food O
(I O
was O
going O
for O
beef, O
but O
it O
didn't O
work, O
so O
we'll O
come O
again)))). O

For O
dessert O
we O
ordered O
sorbet, O
its O
serving B-TARGET
was O
a O
whole O
ritual! O

And O
the O
taste O
is O
great, O
we O
had O
strawberry B-TARGET
and O
mango. B-TARGET

In O
general O
we O
were O
very O
satisfied, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
again O
and O
save O
room O
for O
meat O
this O
time O
=) O

Calm O
and O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
attentive O
but O
discreet O
service B-TARGET
and O
great O
food B-TARGET
- O
all O
at O
least O
a O
10! O

Marina O
and O
Katya, O
thank O
you O
for O
a O
wonderful O
evening, O
we O
hope O
to O
visit O
you O
again O
:-) O

I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
with O
my O
family, O
my O
wife O
and O
my O
brother. O

I O
booked O
a O
table O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
in O
advance O
which O
was O
very O
convenient: O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
a O
weekday, O
the O
veranda O
was O
completely O
occupied. O

At O
the O
entrance O
a O
smiling O
girl B-TARGET
hostess I-TARGET
welcomed O
us O
and O
showed O
us O
to O
our O
table-pleasant. O

A O
young O
man, O
Anton, O
was O
waiting O
for O
us. O

There O
was O
a O
slight O
panic O
while O
choosing O
a O
dish, O
because O
we O
wanted O
to O
try O
everything)))) O

We O
chose O
satsivi B-TARGET
(taste O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time O
he O
tried O
cold O
one O
- O
it O
was O
wonderful, O
very O
delicate O
taste), O
Mingrelian-style B-TARGET
khachapuri I-TARGET
(it O
was O
better O
than O
cheese O
pizza))))), O
barbecue O
dishes O
and O
some O
other O
snacks O
and O
salads, O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
which O
ones. O

For O
dessert O
my O
wife O
took O
a O
classic O
Napoleon, B-TARGET
tasted O
it O
and O
whispered- O
just O
like O
in O
my O
childhood, O
it O
was O
yummy))) O

I O
decided O
to O
try O
mutton O
balls O
- O
I O
wasn't O
impressed, O
because O
they O
were O
frozen, O
taste O
absolutely O
different O
from O
what O
it O
should O
be. O

Otherwise O
the O
cooks B-TARGET
were O
good. O

Waiter B-TARGET
Anton O
worked O
well, O
without O
any O
major O
delays O
and O
without O
rushing O
anywhere. O

It's O
very O
nice O
when O
good O
food B-TARGET
isn't O
let O
down O
by O
bad O
service. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
homely O
and O
very O
cozy, O
the O
toilet B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
and O
playing O
there O
tales O
are O
relaxing)))). O

In O
the O
end O
we O
could O
hardly O
get O
up O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
because O
of O
the O
large O
amount O
of O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
happy, O
full O
and O
a O
little O
tipsy))). O

Thank O
you O
very O
much. O

I`ve O
been O
to O
the O
Wave O
Restaurant O
recently O
for O
the O
first O
time! O

A O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
met O
me O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
offered O
tables O
to O
choose O
from! O

I O
decided O
to O
drink O
wine O
and O
asked O
the O
waitress O
what O
wine O
to O
recommend O
me, O
apparently O
the O
menu O
at O
this O
restaurant O
waiters B-TARGET
do O
not O
learn O
anything O
about O
wine, O
she O
could O
not O
explain O
me! O

I O
chose O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
myself, O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
salad O
of O
arugula O
with O
baked O
potatoes O
and O
scallops O
with O
asparagus! O

Surprised O
when O
they O
brought O
a O
compliment O
from O
the O
chef O
before O
the O
salad, O
though O
my O
delight O
was O
not O
long, O
the O
salad O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
40 O
minutes O
if O
not O
more, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
was O
on O
4, O
then O
I O
waited O
for O
scallops O
for O
another O
30 O
minutes, O
dessert O
was O
not O
even O
ordered! O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
but O
nothing O
more O
than O
that O
and O
the O
2nd O
floor O
is O
very O
stuffy! O

Great O
pub B-TARGET
!!!!!! O

I O
decided O
to O
surprise O
my O
husband O
and O
it O
was O
a O
success! O

Great O
interior B-TARGET
! O

Very O
tasty O
beer B-TARGET
and O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
it, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
also O
excellent, O
all O
orders B-TARGET
were O
very O
tasty, O
and O
the O
main O
reason O
why O
I O
chose O
this O
pub, O
because O
on O
that O
day O
there O
was O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised, O
a O
great O
concert B-TARGET
! O

Great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
place, O
we O
will O
definitely O
visit O
it O
again! O

For O
me O
the O
answer O
to O
the O
question O
"Is O
it O
worth O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant? B-TARGET
-Unambiguous. O

Yes, O
of O
course O
you O
should! O

There O
are O
many O
reasons O
for O
this: O
One O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
- O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Then-attentive O
staff, B-TARGET
reasonable O
prices, O
cozy O
and O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
the O
city O
center. O

I O
like O
the O
location O
of O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET
(Opposite O
the O
Little O
Drama O
Theater.) O

I O
like O
the O
people B-TARGET
who O
come O
here, O
too. O

Good O
energy O
in O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
created O
by O
attentive O
and O
professional O
people. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
pity O
that O
many O
people O
don't O
know O
it. O

You O
feel O
good O
here O
at O
any O
time, O
in O
any O
room, B-TARGET
whether O
it's O
a O
big O
feast O
(like O
a O
banquet)) O
or O
just O
to O
have O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee. O

You're O
always O
welcome O
here, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
very O
homely. O

There O
are O
not O
so O
many O
good O
and O
comfortable O
places B-TARGET
like O
that O
in O
St. O
Petersburg. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
guest O
who O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
will O
become O
a O
regular O
customer. O

I O
wish O
"Rubinstein" B-TARGET
prosperity O
and O
success! O

Respectfully O
Irina O

Went O
to O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
didn't O
have O
particularly O
negative O
experiences. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
selection O
of O
pizzas B-TARGET
which O
seemed O
quite O
strange O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
name O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

And O
in O
terms O
of O
taste O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

In O
general O
it O
is O
not O
disgusting, O
but O
we O
ate O
better. O

The O
sushi B-TARGET
is O
much O
better. O

The O
prices, O
of O
course, O
are O
not O
small O
and O
correspond O
to O
the O
name O
"RESTAURANT". B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
but O
also O
at O
an O
average O
level. O

Girls B-TARGET
go O
around O
with O
faces, O
as O
if O
the O
visitors O
owe O
them O
something. O

And O
from O
waitresses B-TARGET
to O
administrators. B-TARGET

If O
so O
the O
receptionists B-TARGET
do O
not O
baffle O
themselves O
with O
a O
smile O
addressed O
to O
customers, O
so O
what O
to O
expect O
from O
the O
younger B-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

Only O
pleased O
the O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
smiled O
all O
the O
time O
and O
although O
he O
did O
not O
serve O
our O
table, O
but O
did O
not O
count O
for O
work O
and O
cleaned O
up O
as O
we O
passed. O

It O
took O
them O
very O
long, O
no, O
VERY O
VERY O
long O
time O
to O
cook/bear O
the O
sushi, O
probably O
40-50 O
minutes O
after O
we O
ordered O
it... O

No-shows O
that O
at O
15.50 O
we O
didn't O
get O
our O
lunch O
order O
though O
it O
was O
stated O
in O
the O
menu O
till O
16.00... O

Anyway, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
quiet O
place O
and O
have O
a O
glass O
and O
chat O
with O
friends O
then O
Rosario B-TARGET
is O
fine. O

If O
your O
goal O
is O
to O
eat O
delicious O
and O
inexpensive O
pizza, B-TARGET
then O
this O
institution O
is O
better O
not O
to O
visit. O

Celebrated O
his O
birthday, O
I O
liked O
everything, O
I O
found O
a O
place B-TARGET
that O
would O
have O
combined O
a O
cozy O
interior B-TARGET
(first B-TARGET
hall), I-TARGET
a O
tasty O
meal, B-TARGET
nice O
staff B-TARGET
andooooo O
very O
affordable O
prices O
(on O
account O
of O
the O
discount O
of O
33% O
in O
honor O
of O
the O
day O
of O
birth), O
but O
still O
there O
were O
a O
few O
very O
strange O
moments. O

1. O
The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
closes O
at O
12:30 O
pm, O
so O
at O
some O
point O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
politely O
informed O
us O
about O
it. O
We O
were O
not O
upset, O
we O
went O
on O
dancing, O
but O
still O
... O
In O
a O
city O
where O
any O
institution O
works O
until O
the O
last O
client O
is O
a O
little O
strange. O

We O
rented O
white O
wine O
Sicilian. O
We O
liked O
it O
and O
asked O
for O
another O
one. O
We O
rented O
another O
one O
and O
there O
was O
only O
one O
bottle O
of O
it O
so O
we O
rented O
the O
third O
one: O
....3. O

Bill.As O
already O
noted O
the O
prices O
are O
so O
democratic O
that O
when O
they O
brought O
me O
the O
bill O
I O
was O
surprised O
because O
for O
a O
company O
of O
7 O
people O
(all O
ordered O
a O
hot O
meal O
+ O
4 O
bottles O
of O
wine, O
salads) O

Bill O
just O
under O
6tr., O
But O
when O
I O
was O
brought O
to O
this O
very O
bill O
on O
it O
in O
pencil O
was O
written O
10% O
service O
and O
added O
about O
700 O
p. O

And O
the O
final O
amount O
has O
already O
been O
dopisnaniya O
pencil, O
I O
gave O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
a O
bank O
card O
for O
what O
she O
asked O
me O
to O
bill O
which O
is O
on O
the O
receipt O
to O
pay O
by O
card, O
and O
service O
in O
cash. O

We O
certainly O
had O
no O
problem O
paying O
(check O
for O
cash O
of O
course O
did O
not O
bring!), O
But O
it O
turns O
out O
out O
blatant O
extortion O
of O
tips, O
and O
we O
would O
have O
left O
them O
anyway! O

Good O
afternoon! O

I O
want O
to O
share O
my O
impressions O
about O
my O
daughter O
Alexandra's O
wedding O
which O
was O
held O
in O
your O
restaurant O
on O
August O
11, O
2012. O

You O
know, O
if O
I O
say O
that O
I O
liked O
everything, O
I O
might O
not O
believe O
me. O

But O
it's O
really O
so. O

And O
the O
wonderful O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
beautiful O
table B-TARGET
setting, I-TARGET
and O
amazing O
food, B-TARGET
and O
even O
with O
the O
exquisite O
design! B-TARGET

And O
most O
importantly O
- O
these O
are O
the O
people B-TARGET
who O
work O
here O
and O
with O
whom O
we O
talked O
about O
organizing O
the O
wedding O
banquet. O

First O
of O
all O
it's O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Alexander. O

Very O
polite, O
friendly O
and O
knowledgeable. O

All O
our O
wishes O
were O
taken O
into O
account. O

We O
would O
also O
like O
to O
mention O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
worked O
on O
our O
banquet O
(unfortunately, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
her O
name). O

Good O
girl! O

Unobtrusively O
the O
extra O
dishes O
were O
taken O
away, O
new O
dishes O
and O
drinks O
were O
served. O

And O
all O
this O
was O
accompanied O
by O
her O
friendly O
smile. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
your O
work O
and O
such O
a O
warm O
attitude B-TARGET
to O
us, O
your O
customers. O

All O
of O
our O
guests O
join O
me O
in O
thanking O
you O
for O
this O
evening O
as O
well. O

And O
our O
newlyweds O
just O
loved O
the O
holiday O
we O
all O
put O
together O
for O
them. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O

Success O
to O
you O
in O
your O
pleasant O
work! O

And O
more O
grateful O
visitors! O

Regards, O
Tatiana. O

Due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
my O
work O
I O
often O
visit O
Moskovskiy O
district, O
and O
several O
times O
I've O
dined O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

At O
daytime O
it O
is O
not O
crowded, O
and O
I O
was O
attracted O
by O
20% O
discount B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
all I-TARGET
meals I-TARGET
until O
16 O
o'clock. O

The B-TARGET
checkroom I-TARGET
didn't O
work, O
but O
it O
didn't O
bother O
us O
as O
there O
were O
plenty O
of O
places O
to O
put O
the O
clothes. O

We O
always O
choose O
the O
second B-TARGET
hall I-TARGET
as O
it O
seems O
more O
cosy O
to O
us. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
oriental, O
soft O
lighting B-TARGET
and O
soft O
background O
music B-TARGET
which O
doesn't O
bother O
the O
conversation. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
options, B-TARGET
but O
I O
like O
the O
food O
that O
we O
choose. O

As O
the O
restaurant O
is O
oriental O
we O
choose O
dishes O
of O
Oriental O
cuisine. O

All O
kebabs, B-TARGET
and O
we O
ordered O
them O
from O
veal, B-TARGET
beef B-TARGET
and O
pork, B-TARGET
were O
excellent. O

Very O
much O
like O
the O
dish B-TARGET
saj I-TARGET
- O
meat, O
beef, O
veal O
with O
mushrooms O
and O
vegetables O
to O
choose O
from, O
served O
in O
a O
large O
metal O
plate O
on O
the O
coals. O

Very O
tasty O
oriental O
tea B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
fig I-TARGET
jam, I-TARGET
though O
it O
is O
rather O
expensive. O

Service B-TARGET
all O
the O
three O
times O
we O
were O
there O
was O
perfect. O

Polite O
and O
friendly O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
always O
ready O
to O
offer O
advice O
and O
recommendations. O

A O
couple O
of O
friends O
of O
mine O
have O
visited O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
my O
recommendation O
and O
were O
also O
very O
satisfied. O

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

Good O
day! O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
like O
to O
discover O
new O
places...different O
restaurants...especially O
Italian O
ones. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
many. O

I O
found O
a O
restaurant O
with O
a O
rating. O
All O
guests O
were O
sitting O
on O
the O
terrace O
(it O
was O
summer), O
while O
we O
were O
sitting O
inside O
(close O
to O
the O
air O
conditioner)). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy. O

Sitting O
right O
in O
front O
of O
the O
kitchen O
(where O
pizza O
is O
made) O
near O
the O
window. O

There O
are O
reviews O
that O
smells O
like O
kitchen O
... O
but O
I O
did O
not O
really O
notice O
... O
and O
a O
light O
aroma O
of O
pizza O
I O
think O
just O
add O
appetite) O

Read O
the O
reviews O
that O
good O
pizza B-TARGET
- O
took O
it, O
and O
were O
very O
pleased!!! O

In O
all O
Italian O
restaurants O
I O
take O
a O
tiramisu, O
a O
bread O
kozin O
and O
...go O
to O
the O
bathroom. O

This O
is O
how O
I O
rate O
the O
establishment. O

The O
bread O
should O
be O
fresh, O
the O
tiramisu O
should O
melt O
in O
your O
mouth, O
and O
the O
toilets O
should O
not O
be O
spared!!! O

Loved O
everything, O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
magical! O

Had O
a O
nice O
time, O
saw O
the O
Savior O
on O
the O
Blood O
through O
the O
window...romantic) B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
polite. O

Drinks O
were O
quick O
... O
and O
the O
food O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
at O
all! O
Thanks O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

Definitely O
will O
come O
again! O

My O
friends O
advised O
"Gorod", O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch O
there O
when O
I O
was O
passing O
by. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
bright O
and O
stylish. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
the O
tables B-TARGET
(to O
the O
right O
of O
the O
entrance) O
are O
set O
very O
close O
to O
each O
other, O
and O
if O
the O
table O
next O
to O
me O
was O
taken, O
I O
wouldn't O
feel O
so O
comfortable. O

I O
was O
immediately O
noticed O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
shown O
to O
my O
table. O

No O
complaints O
about O
the O
service: B-TARGET
they O
served O
quickly O
and O
with O
a O
smile! O

I O
ordered O
borscht, O
pasta, O
homemade O
profiteroles O
with O
hot O
chocolate, O
and O
tea. O

I O
regretted O
ordering O
my O
favorite O
borscht B-TARGET
! O
Here O
it O
is O
not O
tasty: O
broth B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cabbage I-TARGET
... O
With O
a O
lot O
of O
cabbage B-TARGET
! O
I O
tried O
to O
add O
more O
sour O
cream O
))) O
but O
it O
did O
not O
help O
... O
unfortunately. O

Pasta B-TARGET
- I-TARGET
carbonara I-TARGET
was O
decent O
!!! O

And O
from O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
I O
just O
loved O
it!!! O
I've O
eaten O
it O
in O
a O
few O
minutes))) O
and O
this O
after O
borscht O
with O
pasta!!! O

Overall O
impressions O
are O
positive, O
even O
in O
spite O
of O
borscht B-TARGET
)))) O

I O
liked O
the O
15% O
discount O
at O
lunch B-TARGET
time. I-TARGET

Judging O
by O
the O
reviews, O
"City" O
in O
the O
afternoon O
and O
evening O
- O
two O
different O
places. O

I O
plan O
to O
go O
sometime O
in O
the O
evening O
with O
my O
husband. O

Today O
were O
a O
company O
of O
4 O
people, O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time, O
but O
only O
today O
is O
going O
to O
leave O
a O
review. O

In O
order: O
Kitchen B-TARGET
- O
Kharcho B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
shashlik B-TARGET
(tried O
almost O
all O
of O
them) O
5 O
+ O
evaluation, O
lepeshkas, B-TARGET
pretty O
good O
wine B-TARGET
(for O
my O
taste), O
and O
of O
course O
tea B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
thyme I-TARGET
:), O
that's O
what O
you O
need O
and O
worth O
going O
here, O
you O
should O
agree O
that O
in O
such O
a O
place O
to O
take O
a O
salad O
or O
Greek O
salad O
is O
absolutely O
useless, O
it O
should O
not O
be O
good O
here O
:) O

Interior B-TARGET
- O
In O
general, O
quite O
thematically, O
except O
for O
the O
already O
mentioned O
by O
someone O
column B-TARGET
in O
the O
hall O
and O
may O
be O
the O
lack O
of O
light B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
main O
hall. O
I, O
like O
many O
who O
have O
written O
here O
like O
the O
light B-TARGET
hall, I-TARGET
it O
is O
much O
more O
cozy, O
the O
only O
thing O
worth O
paying O
attention O
to O
the O
cleanliness B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tablecloths, I-TARGET
not O
always O
ideal. O

Service B-TARGET
- O
Nice, O
polite O
young B-TARGET
men, I-TARGET
not O
too O
often, O
but O
not O
infrequently O
fit, O
not O
soulless, O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
in O
general O
looks O
organically, O
no O
complaints. O

In O
general O
a O
pleasant O
place B-TARGET
for O
get-togethers, O
both O
business O
and O
private, O
fans O
of O
"ponts O
and O
dogs" O
just O
not O
here, O
the O
institution O
still O
does O
not O
reach O
that O
level O
to O
attract O
these O
characters, O
but O
also O
thank O
God. O

With O
all O
that O
said, O
the O
price O
is O
very O
adequate, O
at O
least O
for O
the O
part O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
that O
interests O
us. O

Thank O
you O
for O
listening. O

Lovely O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
a O
nice O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
bay. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
polite O
staff B-TARGET
and O
all O
requests O
were O
taken O
care O
of. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
good, O
and O
we O
made O
and O
brought O
them O
quickly. O

Overall, O
we O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
enjoyable O
stay O
and O
will O
definitely O
visit O
more O
than O
once. O

Thank O
you! O

This B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
is O
very O
nice. O

The O
food O
is O
very O
tasty O
and O
has O
a O
huge O
portions. B-TARGET

I O
could O
eat O
a O
salad, B-TARGET
barely O
had O
enough O
left O
for O
soup. O
The O
service B-TARGET
was O
amazing! O

There O
is O
a O
very O
good O
waitress B-TARGET
Alyona, O
nice, O
kind, O
friendly O
and O
always O
help O
me O
with O
my O
choice! O

The O
cooks B-TARGET
are O
great, O
really O
good. O

I O
especially O
liked O
the B-TARGET
chicken O
shish O
kebab O
and O
salad B-TARGET
"Rosana", I-TARGET
I O
advise O
everybody O
to O
try O
it. O

In O
fact O
at O
12 O
o'clock O
only O
the O
kitchen O
is O
closed, O
and O
the O
bar B-TARGET
works O
till O
the O
last O
client! O

Everyone O
is O
advised O
to O
go O
there. O

We O
met O
our O
friends O
to O
talk O
and O
drink O
beer. O

We O
ordered O
a O
table O
in O
advance, O
we O
were O
welcomed, O
accompanied, O
brought O
the O
menu O
promptly. O

The O
venue B-TARGET
is O
small O
and O
very O
intimate, O
which O
is O
nice. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
usual, O
as O
in O
other O
pubs, O
we O
were O
pleased O
with B-TARGET
racks I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
books I-TARGET
and O
soft O
couches.) B-TARGET

The O
beer B-TARGET
is O
tasty O
and O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
choose O
from. O

We O
ordered O
boiled B-TARGET
shrimps I-TARGET
- O
shrimps, O
like O
shrimps, O
but O
too O
small O
(240 O
rubles), O
salad B-TARGET
"Salmon" I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
not O
bad, O
but O
pretty O
bland, O
not O
enough O
sauce; B-TARGET
squid O
rings B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
tempura I-TARGET
was O
ok O
for O
beer, O
beef B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
chips I-TARGET
- O
tasty, O
ragout B-TARGET
- O
nice, O
but O
looked O
more O
like O
meat O
broth, O
royal B-TARGET
shrimps I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
- O
very O
tasty O
dish O
(599 O
rubles), O
unfortunately, O
not O
all O
prices. O

There O
was O
only O
one O
waitress B-TARGET
for O
the O
restaurant O
(Friday O
evening O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
busy), O
but O
she O
managed, O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
for O
the O
drinks O
and O
dishes, O
lacked O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
friendliness, O
but O
on O
the O
whole O
not O
bad. O

Our O
bill O
for O
5 O
people O
amounted O
to O
about O
4 O
000 O
rubles. O

To O
sum O
it O
up, O
we O
had O
a O
great O
time O
and O
it O
was O
a O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

Our O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Atlantis" I-TARGET
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
pleasant O
and O
comfortable O
places O
in O
our O
restaurant O
for O
many O
years. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
in O
the O
summer O
time O
it's O
very O
nice O
to O
be O
on O
the O
veranda. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
great! O

Desserts B-TARGET
are O
a O
delicious O
topic O
in O
their O
own O
right:) O

Blancmange B-TARGET
and O
Decoise B-TARGET
are O
my O
favorites, O
highly O
recommended! O

Sushi, B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
like O
it, O
is O
super O
tasty, O
probably O
the O
most O
delicious O
in O
the O
city, O
and O
outside O
of O
it, O
in O
my O
opinion!) O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
always O
polite, O
and O
when O
we O
celebrated O
our O
holidays O
there O
more O
than O
once O
(at O
different O
times O
from O
10 O
to O
50 O
guests) O
everything O
was O
at O
the O
highest O
level, O
and O
the O
organization, B-TARGET
and O
discussion B-TARGET
of O
the O
menu, O
and O
serving B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

Feedback O
is O
like O
the O
eternal O
story O
that O
the O
glass O
is O
half O
full O
or O
half O
empty O
- O
it O
all O
depends O
on O
what O
a O
person O
wants O
to O
find O
and O
see O
in O
a O
particular O
place. O

Either O
you O
look O
for O
dust O
on O
the O
shelves O
and O
other O
small O
things, O
or O
enjoy O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
and O
everything O
that O
surrounds O
you. O

If O
you O
decide O
to O
spend O
a O
beautiful O
day O
or O
evening O
in O
a O
pleasant O
company O
in O
a O
comfortable O
place O
with O
good O
food, B-TARGET
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
Atlantis I-TARGET
will O
help O
you O
with O
this. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
and O
thank O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
the O
quality O
work O
over O
the O
years! O

Good O
evening! O

I O
had O
dinner O
at O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant B-TARGET
tonight. O

I O
personally O
really O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
somewhat O
reminiscent O
of O
the O
restaurant O
"Russian O
Kitch". O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
simply O
magical. O

I O
completely O
agree O
with O
NAVEX O
that O
the O
soup B-TARGET
made I-TARGET
of O
roasted O
garlic O
is O
something O
wonderful. O

As O
they O
told O
us O
they O
don't O
serve O
this O
anywhere O
else O
in O
town, O
it's O
their O
chef's B-TARGET
specialty. I-TARGET

We O
also O
tried O
the O
cream O
soup B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
porcini O
mushrooms O
(wonderful) O
and O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimps I-TARGET
(very O
tasty). O

Separately O
I O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
the O
service B-TARGET
- O
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
say O
a O
special O
thanks O
to O
waiter B-TARGET
Maria. O

I O
recommend O
everyone O
to O
go O
and O
see O
for O
themselves. O

Very O
spacious O
and O
light, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
in O
my O
favorite O
style:) O

Lots O
of O
space, B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window. O

We O
came O
for O
a O
coffee O
at O
noon O
(my O
husband O
has O
an O
office O
in O
the O
Business O
Center O
Avenue), O
we O
did O
not O
feel O
like O
eating, O
that O
is O
why O
we O
will O
appreciate O
the O
cuisine O
another O
time. O

I O
only O
ate O
pumpkin B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
(I O
liked O
it O
and O
the O
bread O
was O
very O
good) O
and O
my O
husband O
drank O
coffee. O

I O
hope O
to O
try O
the O
beer B-TARGET
next O
time, O
they O
say O
it's O
not O
bad. O

No O
complaints O
to O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
however O
we O
were O
in O
the O
daytime, O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
the O
room, O
so O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
it O
is O
in O
the O
evening. O

We O
were O
served O
fast:) O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
again! O

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
go O
there O
with O
friends O
and O
family O
and O
we O
were O
very O
surprised. O

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
restaurant O
there O
were O
no O
empty O
seats O
and O
staff B-TARGET
were O
bustling, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
speed O
and O
attention O
to O
service. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
here O
cared O
about O
the O
mood O
and O
impression O
of O
the O
visitors. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
pleased, O
the O
classic O
Italian B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
were O
surprisingly O
delicious O
and O
extremely O
authentic. O

Everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
quite O
generous. O

After O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
working O
on O
the O
mistakes O
and O
the O
beef B-TARGET
carpaccio I-TARGET
served O
to O
us O
was O
decorated O
better O
than O
in O
the O
review O
of O
last O
March. O

Noted O
the O
children's B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
and O
next O
time O
we O
will O
probably O
take O
the O
kids O
too. O

Positive O
for O
me O
was O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
tobacco O
smoke. O

In O
general O
for O
us O
this O
visit O
was O
a O
pleasant O
discovery O
that O
not O
far O
from O
home O
there O
is O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
eat O
in O
a O
warm O
atmosphere B-TARGET
with O
the O
whole O
family. O

At O
least O
now O
I O
know O
where O
you O
can O
get O
a O
great O
pizza B-TARGET
close O
to O
home, O
not O
worse O
than O
in O
northern O
Italy O
exactly O
) O

On O
the O
2nd O
floor O
was O
two O
times. O

Beautiful O
interior B-TARGET
- O
we O
sat O
by O
the O
window O
at O
a O
table O
with O
couches. O

Much O
more O
comfortable O
than O
on O
the O
1st O
floor. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
not O
large, O
but O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty))) O

Service B-TARGET
was O
not O
good O
- O
it O
took O
a O
VERY O
long O
time O
to O
prepare O
(or O
bring??) O
an O
order, O
considering O
that O
both O
times O
the O
restaurant O
was O
half O
empty... O

If O
it O
wasn't O
for O
that, O
I O
could O
have O
called O
Mojo B-TARGET
a O
nice O
place O
to O
sit O
with O
friends O
in O
the O
evening. O

January O
13, O
2014. O

Celebrated O
a O
birthday O
party! O

There O
were O
5 O
of O
us O
and O
it O
was O
a O
Monday! O

There O
were O
3 O
tables O
sitting O
in O
the O
room O
with O
us, O
the O
service-very B-TARGET
nice! O

Our O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
by O
the O
house O
very O
often O
during O
the O
evening O
to O
check O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
and O
if O
we O
wanted O
anything! O

Hookah B-TARGET
- O
super! O

We O
ordered O
appetizers B-TARGET
- I-TARGET
wings, I-TARGET
cheese B-TARGET
balls I-TARGET
and O
fruit B-TARGET
- O
we O
liked O
them O
all! O

It O
didn't O
take O
long! O

We O
were O
very O
happy! O

Thank O
you! O

We O
will O
come O
back O
to O
you! O

Maybe O
the O
staff O
or O
restaurant O
managers O
do O
read O
reviews O
and O
correct O
themselves... O
I O
have O
been O
reading O
reviews O
on O
this O
site O
lately, O
but O
when O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
April, O
I O
hadn't O
read O
anything O
about O
it. O

I O
really O
liked O
it. O

When O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
were O
there O
around O
8 O
pm O
on O
Monday O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
girl B-TARGET
and O
she O
took O
me O
to O
the O
table O
and O
brought O
me O
the O
menu. O

In O
5 O
minutes O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
over O
and O
we O
ordered, O
then O
he O
brought O
spices O
and O
put O
out O
the O
tableware O
and O
the O
drinks O
quickly O
appeared O
on O
the O
table. O

In O
advertising, O
I O
saw O
that O
they O
have O
a O
children's B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
the O
waiter O
showed O
where O
it O
is, O
of O
course O
a O
little O
small, O
but O
3-4 O
children O
will O
find O
something O
to O
do O
there, O
there O
was O
a O
TV, B-TARGET
computer, B-TARGET
blackboard B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crayons I-TARGET
and O
a O
table B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
drawing, I-TARGET
my O
son O
would O
have O
liked O
it. O

So O
the O
salads O
came O
in O
20 O
minutes, O
I O
ordered O
the O
tuna, B-TARGET
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
my O
husband O
Caesar B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
- O
without O
much O
enthusiasm, O
but O
also O
without O
criticism. O

Hot, O
mine O
was O
steak O
with O
a O
sauce B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
porcini I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
and O
he O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O
My O
husband O
ordered O
a O
marble B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
with O
something O
there, O
it O
was O
pretty O
dry, O
but O
with O
dressing O
it O
was O
pretty O
good. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
latte B-TARGET
were O
good. O

All O
food B-TARGET
looked O
appetizing O
and O
the O
portion B-TARGET
sizes O
were O
decent. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
ashtray O
was O
changed O
quickly, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
guy O
tactfully O
helped O
with O
dessert O
choices. O

The O
bill O
was O
3300. O

On O
occasion, O
will O
stop O
by O
for O
dessert O
with O
the O
child. O

I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
pub O
for O
the O
first O
time O
recently O
and O
I O
can O
say O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
place. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
very O
much O
- O
purely O
pub-like, O
but O
unobtrusive O
and O
comfortable. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
great O
- O
lots O
of O
fun O
and O
friendly O
conversation. O

As O
for O
service, B-TARGET
it's O
quite O
acceptable O
for O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
offered O
one O
of O
the O
few O
free O
tables O
and O
after O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
the O
waiter O
brought O
the O
menu. O

We O
were O
pleased O
to O
have O
a O
wide O
selection O
of O
beers B-TARGET
and O
other O
alcoholic B-TARGET
drinks, O
as O
well O
as O
snacks B-TARGET
and O
various O
dishes B-TARGET
to O
suit O
every O
taste. O

I O
was O
surprised O
to O
find O
such O
a O
wide O
menu B-TARGET
in O
the O
pub! O

We O
couldn't O
wait O
for O
our O
order O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
minutes. O

The O
main O
drawback O
was O
that O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
forgetfulness: O
our O
friend O
waited O
for O
his O
cigarettes O
only O
after O
the O
third O
request. O

But O
it O
can O
be O
compensated O
by O
very O
polite O
service. B-TARGET

Of O
what O
we O
ordered O
we O
liked O
the O
beer B-TARGET
- O
very O
tasty! O

The O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
not O
bad O
either. O

No O
complaints O
about O
croutons B-TARGET
and O
steak, B-TARGET
but O
caesar B-TARGET
has I-TARGET
too O
much O
spice. O

But O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
a O
disappointment O
- O
it's O
not O
a O
pub O
dish O
after O
all! O

At O
the O
end O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
bill O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
15 O
minutes O
more O
for O
our O
change. O

But O
on O
the O
whole O
we O
had O
a O
good O
time! O

I O
think O
we O
will O
visit O
more O
often. O

By O
the O
way, O
the O
prices O
are O
also O
quite O
normal O
- O
average O
for O
such O
places B-TARGET
and O
not O
overpriced O
like O
in O
many O
other O
places. O

I O
love O
Italian O
food. O

Several O
times O
we O
went O
with O
friends, O
but O
all O
failed. O

Dishes O
are O
brought O
in O
cold, O
not O
brought O
out O
in O
time. O

First O
one O
friend, O
then O
another, O
and O
me O
in O
another O
15 O
minutes. O

As O
a O
result O
my O
friends O
had O
to O
eat O
everything O
cold. O

That O
time O
they O
brought O
me O
unleavened O
pasta B-TARGET
sprinkled O
with O
butter O
and O
grated O
cheese. O

This O
does O
not O
look O
like O
pasta! B-TARGET

And O
this O
is O
prepared O
by O
professionals!?? O

Although, O
before O
this O
incident, O
the O
dishes O
were O
delicious, O
but O
again, O
brought O
out O
not O
on O
time O
or O
all O
at O
once O
(and O
salads, O
and O
hot, O
and O
pizza). O

We O
made O
a O
remark O
to B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
waiter, I-TARGET
and O
she O
looked O
at O
us, O
slammed O
her O
eyes O
and O
asked: O
"What's O
wrong?". O

You O
ask O
to O
heat O
it O
up O
- O
she O
made O
such O
a O
disgruntled O
face O
that O
you'd O
better O
eat O
cold... O

And O
the O
dishes O
were O
mixed O
up. O

We O
ordered O
one O
thing O
and O
they O
brought O
us O
another O
and O
didn't O
even O
apologize. O

How O
many O
times O
we O
went O
- O
we O
left O
with O
ruined O
mood O
every O
time! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
terrible, O
I O
will O
never O
go O
there O
again! O

There O
are O
nicer O
places O
to O
have O
a O
good O
rest, O
eat O
well O
and O
have O
a O
good O
time! O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
twice. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
made O
me O
sit O
in O
a O
comfortable O
sofa B-TARGET
and O
was O
served O
quickly O
without O
criticism. O
I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
sum O
of O
the O
bill, O
it O
was O
very O
inexpensive O
for O
a O
place B-TARGET
on O
Nevsky O
Prospekt. O

The O
second O
time O
I O
came O
with O
a O
girl O
and O
I O
booked O
the O
table O
where O
I O
was O
sitting O
before, O
the B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
at O
a O
good O
level, O
very O
good O
hookah B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
and O
the O
hookah B-TARGET
was O
great. O

I O
had O
a O
really O
good O
time O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
really O
liked O
it. O

I O
think O
it O
wasn't O
my O
last O
time. O

Came O
to O
the O
"appetite" O
by O
chance. O

It O
was O
a O
weekday O
(Tuesday, O
September O
14) O
and O
it O
was O
crowded, O
but O
we O
decided O
to O
stay. O
The O
manager O
met O
us, O
a O
dark-haired O
thin O
girl, O
showed O
us O
to O
the O
table O
and O
gave O
us O
the O
menu... O

After O
5 O
minutes O
the O
waitress O
came, O
took O
the O
order O
and O
left... O

Looking O
around O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full, O
but O
we O
were O
wrong, O
the O
wait O
was O
not O
long, O
quite O
acceptable O
for O
any O
institution, O
with O
a O
pleasant O
conversation O
we O
did O
not O
notice O
how O
time O
passed O
... O

Surprisingly O
our O
lunch B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
satisfying O
and O
fully O
in O
keeping O
with O
its O
price. O

In O
general, O
a O
very O
good O
place, B-TARGET
varied, O
tasty O
menu, B-TARGET
reasonable O
prices O
and O
high O
quality O
service! B-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
at O
the O
weekend. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
of O
30 O
people O
in O
Drago O
restaurant O
on O
July O
1, O
2010. O

We O
have O
chosen O
it B-TARGET
by O
chance, O
because O
of O
more O
of O
a O
location, O
but O
we O
didn't O
regret O
it. O

It B-TARGET
is O
a O
small O
restaurant, O
but O
there O
was O
enough O
space O
for O
our O
celebration, O
we O
had O
a O
veranda O
at O
our O
disposal. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
bright O
and O
you O
feel O
comfortable O
there. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
good: O
delicious O
meat B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
appetizers B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tender I-TARGET
bacon I-TARGET
which O
conquered O
the O
men, O
delicious O
salads. B-TARGET

The O
guests O
liked O
the O
homemade B-TARGET
wine. I-TARGET

The O
first B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
at O
the O
restaurant O
is O
excellent O
(we O
tried O
the O
soup B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
smoked I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
caviar I-TARGET
on O
our O
next O
visit). O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
worthy O
of O
special O
mention. O

Waitresses B-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
helpful. O

The B-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
Svetlana O
helped O
us O
with O
our O
banquet O
menu O
and O
took O
care O
of O
decorating B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
room. I-TARGET

In O
general O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Drago" O
leaves O
a O
very O
positive O
impression O
both O
after O
the O
event O
and O
after O
a O
family O
dinner. O

After O
a O
mixed O
impression O
of O
the O
restaurant O
Harbin O
on O
Primorskaya, O
we O
decided O
to O
check O
our O
impressions O
of O
the O
first O
visit O
to O
the O
restaurant O
on O
Akademicheskaya. O

In O
the O
evening O
around O
18 O
o'clock O
we O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
Harbin O
on O
Akademicheskaya. O

There O
were O
rooms O
for O
smokers O
and O
non-smokers. O

We O
chose O
the O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
which O
is O
completely O
separate O
from O
the O
smoking O
customers O
unlike O
Harbin O
on O
Primorskaya. O

Chairs B-TARGET
in O
the O
non-smoking O
room O
are O
European, O
very O
comfortable, O
unlike O
the O
other O
hall B-TARGET
where O
they O
are O
in O
the O
Chinese O
style, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
comfortable O
to O
sit O
on O
them. O

The O
order O
was O
taken O
quickly, O
and, O
what O
was O
our O
surprise, O
in O
5 O
minutes O
we O
got O
the O
first O
dish. O

Within O
15 O
minutes O
the O
entire O
order O
was O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
food B-TARGET
at O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
good, O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cooking, I-TARGET
to O
our O
taste, O
much O
better O
than O
in O
Harbin O
on O
Seaside O
(for O
comparison O
we O
ordered O
a O
few O
dishes O
the O
same O
as O
in O
another O
restaurant). O

Special O
mention O
should O
be O
made O
of O
tea. O

The O
choice O
here O
is O
much O
better O
and O
richer. O

Although O
the O
offerings O
could O
have O
been O
bigger. O

What O
is O
pleasant O
is O
that O
the O
tea B-TARGET
is O
not O
bagged O
unlike O
the O
restaurant O
at O
Primorskaya O
Street. O

On O
the O
menu O
is O
a O
good O
French B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
dry I-TARGET
wine. I-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
quality O
of O
dishes O
which O
were O
left O
on O
time O
as O
well O
as O
other O
small O
details, O
which O
was O
very O
pleasant. O

Without O
alcohol O
the O
bill O
for O
two O
people O
amounted O
to O
1300 O
roubles. O

We O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
visit. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
share O
my O
impressions O
about O
our O
restaurant O
"Nettle. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
silver O
wedding O
on O
27.08.2010. O

At O
the O
first O
meeting O
with O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
(when O
ordering), O
we O
liked O
everything. O

Nice O
interior, B-TARGET
pleasant, O
well-mannered O
administrator B-TARGET
Svetlana. O

It O
was O
very O
helpful O
when O
choosing O
the O
menu. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
were O
attentive O
and O
unobtrusive O
while O
serving O
the O
banquet O
so O
that O
there O
were O
no O
empty O
plates. O

The O
guests O
were O
very O
happy O
too. O

Behind O
the O
bar O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
helped O
with O
the O
music, O
unfortunately, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
all O
the O
names. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
very O
homely. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much, O
we O
will O
visit O
this O
nice O
place B-TARGET
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
our O
friends. O

Visit O
"Nettles" B-TARGET
will O
stay O
for O
a O
lifetime! O

Very O
strange, O
having O
ordered O
a O
table O
in O
the O
cafe O
to O
come O
and O
there O
... O
nobody. O

I O
mean O
none O
of O
the O
visitors. O

As O
if O
you O
didn't O
come O
to O
the O
cafe, O
but O
guests, O
and O
you O
were O
the O
only O
one O
waiting O
there. O

Homey O
interior B-TARGET
- O
yes, O
the O
atmosphere... O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
created O
by O
the O
visitors, O
there O
was O
a O
little O
extra O
noise, O
voices, O
faces... O

In O
general, O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
left O
a O
very O
pleasant O
impression. O

Small, O
cozy, O
croutons O
made O
of O
their O
own B-TARGET
delicious I-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
brighten O
up O
the O
wait O
for O
food. O

There O
is O
no O
beer, B-TARGET
but O
it O
seems O
that O
this O
is O
how O
it O
should O
be O
in O
this O
format. O

The O
mind O
searches O
for O
minuses O
and O
clues, O
and O
there O
they O
are... O

But O
the O
impression O
is O
formed O
on O
the O
emotions O
- O
the O
emotions O
of O
the O
visit O
were O
only O
positive! O

Went O
in O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
child. O

Music O
in O
the O
background O
- O
the O
Hermitage O
radio. O

Weather O
was O
hot O
and O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
second O
hall, O
it O
was O
cooler O
there. O

The O
food B-TARGET
did O
not O
disappoint O
but O
did O
not O
arouse O
much O
enthusiasm O
either. O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
decent. O

The O
girl O
who O
was O
a O
waiter O
and O
cashier O
in O
one O
person O
was O
in O
the O
first O
hall O
most O
of O
the O
time O
and O
did O
not O
always O
control O
when O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
remove O
the O
plates O
or O
respond O
to O
new O
requests. O

We O
received O
a O
neighbor's O
card O
with O
a O
15% O
discount O
and O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

We O
will O
come O
again. O

Hello! O

Visited O
your O
place O
yesterday O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
passing O
by O
it O
I O
had O
no O
chance O
to O
stop O
by, O
we O
had O
dinner O
with O
the O
family O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
before O
at O
Nevsky, O
and O
we O
were O
not O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
service. O

I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
visiting O
your O
place B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
Marat I-TARGET
has O
changed O
my O
attitude O
in O
the O
best O
way. O

Came O
to O
you O
in O
the O
evening, O
tired, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
all O
the O
rooms B-TARGET
are O
packed O
and O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
it O
is O
still O
cool O
to O
sit O
with O
a O
child. O
A O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
met O
us O
and O
offered O
several O
tables O
where O
you O
can O
sit O
down, O
a O
girl B-TARGET
has O
accompanied O
us O
to O
the O
table O
(name O
unfortunately O
I O
do O
not O
remember) O
judging O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
administrator, B-TARGET
she O
also O
served O
the O
menu, O
which O
most O
of O
all O
surprised O
us O
absolutely O
free O
water O
in O
glasses, O
it O
was O
very O
pleasant. O

In O
my O
two O
visits O
to O
Nevsky O
Prospekt, O
I O
did O
not O
even O
know O
that O
you O
had O
such O
a O
provision. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
unobtrusive O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
at O
home. O

Usually O
we O
like O
to O
eat O
somewhere O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
I O
was O
even O
a O
little O
bit O
surprised O
that O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
helped O
us O
in O
our O
choice, O
usually O
it O
was O
shadows O
flashing O
by O
the O
cash O
desk, O
muttering O
something O
to O
the O
waiters. O

Brought O
us O
an O
order O
a O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
just O
20 O
minutes O
later, O
hot. O

In O
general, O
the O
evening O
was O
on O
fire. O

Many O
thanks O
to O
a O
girl B-TARGET
for O
the O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
to O
the O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
we O
would O
like O
to O
see O
such O
staff B-TARGET
in O
St O
Petersburg O
establishments. O

I O
think O
we O
will O
visit O
you O
again O
and O
again. O

I O
somehow O
saw O
that O
a O
new O
restaurant O
was O
opened O
on O
the O
place O
of O
a O
known O
store. O

The O
view O
through O
the O
window O
from O
Nevsky O
Prospekt O
made O
me O
look O
in. O

And O
the O
interior B-TARGET
did O
not O
disappoint O
me, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
I O
was O
very O
happy. O

Very O
nice O
and O
cosy O
place. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
very O
nice. O

Our O
waiter B-TARGET
had O
to O
explain O
many O
things O
to O
us O
as O
I O
was O
not O
familiar O
with O
Asian O
food. O

But O
he O
offered O
a O
lot, O
described O
and O
helped O
us O
choose. O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
choice. O

I O
got O
the O
coconut O
seafood O
soup. O

It O
was O
spicy, O
but O
I O
figured O
that O
was O
a O
feature O
of O
the O
cuisine. O

But O
I O
like O
spicy O
food O
and O
was O
delighted O
with O
the O
dish. B-TARGET

A O
friend O
ordered O
the O
salad O
with O
oranges, O
arugula O
and O
salmon, O
and O
for O
dessert O
we O
had O
mango O
mousse O
and O
lemon O
dessert. O

We O
liked O
everything O
very O
much. O

It O
was O
insanely O
delicious!!!! O

I O
advise O
everyone O
to O
definitely O
visit O
this O
place B-TARGET
!!!! O

On O
April O
27th O
I O
was O
walking O
with O
my O
wife O
in O
Pushkin O
and O
just O
happened O
to O
come O
in O
for O
a O
bite O
to O
eat. O

We O
ordered O
pork O
shish O
kebabs, O
grilled O
vegetables, O
Idaho O
potatoes O
with O
homemade O
morsels O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
French O
white O
dry O
wine. O

What O
we O
liked. O

Very O
tasty, O
large O
kebab B-TARGET
on O
a O
skewer O
with O
an O
original O
base. O

When O
it O
is O
brought O
in, O
it O
burns. O

Grilled B-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and O
"Idaho" B-TARGET
are O
also O
very O
good. O

In O
short, O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
"Ristoranchik" O
did O
not O
impress O
me O
too O
much. O

Due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
walls B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
glass I-TARGET
one O
feels O
like O
you're O
in O
a O
greenhouse. O

But O
there O
is O
something O
to O
this O
as O
well. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
there O
was O
a O
problem: O
When O
ordering O
the O
menu O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
suggested O
having O
a O
500 O
mlt O
morsel O
but O
the O
waitress O
brought O
a O
200 O
mlt O
glass O
which O
was O
very O
thin O
and O
tall. O

I O
did O
not O
pay O
attention O
at O
first. O

And O
at O
the O
end O
when O
I O
told O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
about O
it O
she O
was O
very O
confused. O

I O
thought O
that O
if O
I O
hadn't O
taken O
that O
into O
consideration, O
I O
would O
have O
paid O
for O
two O
500mlt O
glasses O
and O
not O
two O
200mlt O
ones. O

But O
that O
was O
just O
my O
guess. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day, O
the O
food O
was O
served O
by O
a O
girl O
and O
a O
young O
guy. O

It O
was O
fast, O
polite O
and O
tidy. O

We O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
for O
our O
order. O

Used O
dishes O
were O
quickly O
taken O
away. O

Everything O
was O
friendly O
and O
smiling. O

We O
got O
the O
bill O
for O
2050 O
rubles. O

In O
my O
opinion O
it O
was O
a O
very O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
go. O

I O
recommend O
it. O

Went O
to O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
with O
a O
friend O
on O
the O
recommendation O
of O
parents, O
they O
were O
recently O
they O
liked O
it O
very O
much! O

We O
liked O
it O
too! O

I O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
very O
much O
and O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
first O
room, O
the O
curtains B-TARGET
were O
great O
and O
there O
were O
a O
couple O
of O
pictures B-TARGET
that O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
at O
home). O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
also O
quite O
good, O
they O
cooked O
quite O
fast, O
I O
had O
pike-perch B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
rice, I-TARGET
it O
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
great O
coffee B-TARGET
Borgia, I-TARGET
I O
had O
never O
tasted O
it O
before! O

I O
tried O
one O
of O
the O
oriental B-TARGET
salads I-TARGET
and O
I O
can't O
reproduce O
the O
name O
of O
it, O
but O
she O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
too! O

The O
Americano B-TARGET
did O
not O
disappoint O
her O
either! O

The O
only O
thing O
was O
that O
we O
were O
there O
on O
Friday O
night O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
slow, O
the O
girl O
and O
the O
young O
man O
who O
were O
there O
were O
minding O
their O
own O
business! O

(No O
further O
criticisms O
to O
this O
place O
in O
principle O
did O
not O
arise) O

In O
general, O
the O
conclusion: O
a O
cozy O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
center, B-TARGET
with O
reasonable O
prices O
and O
a O
very O
comfortable O
atmosphere.) B-TARGET

Very O
sincere O
and O
warm O
atmosphere B-TARGET
created O
for O
us O
in O
the O
restaurant O
Prospect. O

We O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
the O
meeting O
of O
friends O
here. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
decorated O
in O
the O
style O
of O
St. O
Petersburg. O
The O
food B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
very O
tasty, O
wonderful O
table B-TARGET
decoration I-TARGET
and O
individual O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
prices O
are O
pleasantly O
surprising. O

Everyone O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
wonderful O
evening. O

Many O
thanks O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
couldn't O
help O
but O
to O
visit O
this O
place, O
as O
we O
are O
both O
big O
fans O
of O
Italian O
cuisine. O

It O
was O
a O
weekday, O
at O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
lady B-TARGET
who O
said O
that O
there O
were O
no O
seats. O
After O
looking O
around O
and O
the O
truth O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
taken. O

We O
decided O
not O
to O
give O
up O
and O
offered O
to O
wait O
if O
any O
table O
will O
be O
free). O

She O
immediately O
said O
that O
there O
were O
tables O
downstairs, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
light... O
During O
this O
conversation O
the O
lights O
downstairs O
were O
turned O
on O
and O
we O
were O
escorted O
downstairs... O

We O
were O
taken O
to O
a O
table O
for O
two O
with O
a O
noisy O
group O
of O
people O
sitting O
next O
to O
us O
and O
it O
was O
very O
noisy O
in O
general. O

There B-TARGET
were O
a O
couple O
of O
blank O
pages O
with O
lots O
of O
pastas B-TARGET
and O
pizzas B-TARGET
and O
not O
much O
in O
the O
way O
of O
salads B-TARGET
and O
appetizers. B-TARGET

A O
person O
who O
doesn't O
know O
Italian O
food O
will O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
understanding O
it. O

Very O
small O
selection O
of O
wine B-TARGET
. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
quick O
to O
take O
our O
order. O

Drinks O
were O
also O
quickly O
served. O

A O
cappuccino B-TARGET
coffee, O
in O
a O
large O
mug, O
is O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
champagne B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad. O

The O
food B-TARGET
... O
We O
didn't O
like O
it. O

In O
comparison O
to O
other O
Italian O
restaurants O
where O
we O
eat O
(cork O
group, O
italy O
group) O
in O
general O
not O
comparable. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
the O
price O
corresponds O
to O
the O
quality. O

This O
is O
a O
cafe, O
not O
a O
restaurant. O

Overall, O
the O
overall O
impression O
is O
pretty O
good. O

Good O
day O
to O
all! O

I O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
MISO O
at O
Moskovskiy O
with O
my O
colleagues O
for O
lunch O
almost O
every O
day, O
usually O
a O
company O
of O
5-6 O
people. O
Before O
this O
incident O
we O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
nice O
interior B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere. B-TARGET
But O
in O
our O
next O
lunch B-TARGET
was O
added O
a O
human O
hair O
-!!!!!! O

Black O
and O
dense, O
perfectly O
wrapped O
around O
a B-TARGET
piece I-TARGET
of O
meat, O
which O
got O
in O
my O
mouth. O

The O
good O
mood O
was O
gone O
with O
the O
appetite. O

Of O
course O
I O
was O
offered O
a O
substitute O
meal, B-TARGET
but O
I O
had O
no O
desire O
to O
eat O
any O
more! O

I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
I, O
or O
my O
colleagues O
will O
want O
to O
visit O
this O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
near O
future. O

The O
last O
time O
I O
was O
in O
this O
restaurant O
was O
a O
few O
years O
ago. O

I O
liked O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
big O
portions B-TARGET
and O
reasonable O
prices. O

It O
was O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O

The O
seating O
area B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
outstanding, O
but O
not O
intrusive O
either. O

The O
impression O
is O
very O
positive. O

I've O
recently O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
birthday O
party O
with O
a O
small O
group O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
here O
and O
refresh O
my O
memories. O

As O
before, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
tasty O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
decent. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
huge O
and O
you O
can O
choose O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

We O
were O
sitting O
on O
the O
first O
floor. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting O
- O
I O
haven't O
seen O
anything O
like O
it O
before. O

The O
guests O
and O
I O
liked O
it O
on O
the O
whole. O

It O
was O
my O
friend's O
birthday, O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
"Tres O
Amigos" O
and O
we O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
interior B-TARGET
and O
the O
environment, B-TARGET
very O
cosy O
and O
homely O
atmosphere. O

Since O
we're O
all O
non-smokers, O
we O
were O
escorted O
into O
the O
non-smoking O
room O
by O
friendly O
and O
smiling O
waiters, B-TARGET
the O
room B-TARGET
was O
spacious O
and O
bright, O
very O
comfortable! O

I O
want O
to O
mention O
the O
work O
of O
the O
staff: B-TARGET
all O
very O
friendly O
and O
smiling O
guys, O
Olga O
our O
waiter B-TARGET
accompanied O
us O
to O
the O
table, O
immediately O
offered O
us O
drinks, O
offered O
her O
help O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
dishes, O
she O
told O
us O
everything O
in O
detail, O
so O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
suffer O
a O
lot O
reading O
the O
menu! O

They O
brought O
us O
drinks O
right O
away, O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
for O
our O
food, O
everything O
was O
very O
fast O
and O
efficient, O
even O
though O
there O
were O
many O
guests O
in O
the O
restaurant O
at O
that O
time! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
delicious, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
large!!!!! O

We O
felt O
like O
at O
home O
the O
whole O
evening!!!! O

At O
this O
restaurant O
we O
liked O
everything O
from O
the O
fiery O
dancing B-TARGET
(which O
was O
in O
the O
evening) O
and O
service, B-TARGET
and O
food, B-TARGET
and O
very O
tasty O
cocktails! B-TARGET

So O
we O
discovered O
a O
new O
place B-TARGET
that O
we O
will O
now O
go O
to O
all O
the O
time, O
where O
everyone O
smiles O
at O
you O
and O
where O
you O
are O
welcome))))) O

Tres B-TARGET
Amigos I-TARGET
you O
are O
the O
best!!!! O

Way O
to O
go))))))))))))))))))))) O

Have O
been O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
for O
the O
first O
time O
by O
chance O
and O
since O
then O
we O
have O
been O
visiting O
quite O
often, O
it's O
nice O
to O
see O
familiar O
faces O
among O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
as O
unfortunately O
they O
were O
changed O
very O
often. O

On O
Monday O
we O
came O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
and O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised: O
the O
songs B-TARGET
are O
FREE!)) O

They O
will O
find O
any O
song O
for O
you. O

As O
for O
the O
food, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
fast O
and O
delicious, O
and O
I O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
beef B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
steaks. I-TARGET

The O
only O
thing O
- O
we O
came O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
on O
Thursday O
the O
Japanese O
cuisine O
was O
not O
working O
(and O
we O
also O
really O
like O
rolls!). O

A O
special O
thank O
you O
for O
service B-TARGET
to O
the O
lovely O
Tatiana, O
very O
often O
we O
get O
to O
her, O
and O
always O
get O
friendly O
and O
good O
service, B-TARGET
always O
give O
advice O
and O
reply O
to O
jokes, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
she B-TARGET
has O
a O
sense O
of O
humor). O

Thank O
you! O

Hello. O

I O
write O
reviews O
about O
restaurants O
not O
often O
and O
only O
bad, O
good O
impression O
mark O
tips O
and O
gratitude O
directly O
to O
the O
restaurant. O

So O
here O
it O
is. O

We O
went O
there O
with O
a O
group O
of O
7 O
people, O
two O
of O
which O
were O
children. O

It O
was O
occupied O
by O
20% O
of O
the O
tables, O
but O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
another O
menu, O
we O
were O
told O
that O
there O
was O
no O
free O
space O
(((( O
someone O
probably O
read O
two O
menus O
at O
a O
time?) O

We O
took O
advantage O
of O
their O
offer O
for O
pasta B-TARGET
and O
sushi. B-TARGET

The O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
swollen O
pasta B-TARGET
with O
an O
incomprehensible O
sauce, B-TARGET
and O
the O
sushi O
.... O
The O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
it O
took O
them O
exactly O
1 O
hour O
and O
20 O
minutes O
to O
cook O
(as O
I O
have O
already O
written O
in O
the O
nearly O
empty O
restaurant). O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
explained O
the O
delay O
by O
the O
large O
volume O
of O
orders, O
and O
after O
receiving O
the O
comments O
she O
did O
not O
approach O
us O
at O
all. O

Several O
times O
asked O
for O
hot B-TARGET
towels, I-TARGET
have O
not O
been O
brought. O

The O
book O
of O
complaints O
was O
also O
not O
given O
to O
me O
(apparently O
there O
are O
no O
sheets O
available). O

All O
could O
be O
good: O
the O
location, B-TARGET
interior, B-TARGET
cuisine, B-TARGET
but O
the O
organization B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
work I-TARGET
is O
terrible, O
it O
is O
just O
not O
clear O
who O
does O
it. O

And O
do O
not O
organize O
any O
action O
if O
you O
have O
one O
chef B-TARGET
and O
he O
can O
not O
serve O
even O
4 O
tables O
at O
once! O

And O
the O
girl B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
seeing O
that O
we O
have O
children O
with O
us, O
could O
have O
warned O
that O
the O
average O
wait B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
food O
1-1.5 O
hours!!!!!!! O

I O
think O
that O
such O
an O
institution B-TARGET
will O
suffer O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
its O
predecessors. O

With O
my O
girlfriends O
on O
Friday O
night O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Pub O
#1. O

Heard O
a O
lot O
about O
it, O
but O
have O
never O
been, O
and O
then O
the O
opportunity O
came O
... O
We O
took O
a O
table, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
came O
just O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes. O

As O
for O
the O
menu, O
the O
pub O
has O
a O
fairly O
large O
beer B-TARGET
list. I-TARGET

That O
said, O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
sushi B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
in O
the O
pub O
didn't O
seem O
quite O
appropriate O
to O
me. O

I'm O
tired O
of O
places O
which O
mix O
all O
the O
formats O
in O
a O
row. O

If O
really O
a O
pub B-TARGET
then O
let O
it O
stay O
a O
pub... O
But O
at O
my O
own O
risk, O
I O
couldn't O
resist O
temptation O
and O
ordered O
my O
favourite O
sushi, O
though O
I O
have O
warned O
myself O
many O
times... O
If O
especially O
not O
to O
pick O
up, O
then O
sushi, B-TARGET
in O
general, O
were O
usual, O
but... O
just O
a O
little O
understretched O
to O
the O
level O
to O
be O
really O
enjoyed. O

Our O
friends O
ordered O
foam B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
and O
steak B-TARGET
and O
they O
liked O
both O
the O
taste O
and O
the O
portion O
size O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
they O
brought. O

The O
beer B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
tasty O
and O
there O
was O
a O
good O
choice, O
as O
it O
should O
be O
in O
a O
pub. O

The O
service O
was O
quick O
enough O
and O
we O
had O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
interior B-TARGET
either. O

Conclusion: O
It's O
worth O
coming O
to O
the O
Pub, B-TARGET
but O
if O
you O
particularly O
picky O
about O
Japanese O
food O
you O
should O
order O
sushi O
in O
specially O
built O
places. O

I O
went O
there O
today O
with O
my O
girlfriend. O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
great, O
all O
made O
of O
wood O
and O
very O
nice! O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
attentive O
and O
unobtrusive. O

Nice O
music B-TARGET
playing! O

As O
for O
the O
food: O
I O
liked O
the B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
beef, I-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
beef B-TARGET
steak! I-TARGET

Also O
can O
not O
miss O
the O
cream B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
salmon! I-TARGET

The O
guys O
are O
very O
good O
- O
very O
tasty! O

And O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
"decent". O

Well, O
we O
were O
really O
surprised O
by O
this O
place B-TARGET
and O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
again O
and O
not O
just O
once! O

I O
stayed O
there O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
on O
Friday. O

It O
was O
very O
good. O

There O
is O
still O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
work O
on, O
of O
course, O
but O
still, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
lovely O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
great O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
good. O

Ordered O
salads O
and O
a O
main O
course O
(salmon O
steak O
and O
a O
dish O
called O
"hearty O
mutton" O
of O
pork). O

Arrived O
quickly. O

Hard O
alcohol, B-TARGET
except O
for O
beer, O
they O
don't O
have, O
apparently, O
problems O
with O
the O
license, O
but O
mead B-TARGET
was O
very O
enjoyable. O

Of O
course O
I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
more O
variety O
in O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
but O
since O
they O
have O
just O
opened O
recently, O
I O
think O
over O
time, O
everything O
will O
be O
fine. O

This O
place O
was O
chosen O
for O
a O
meeting O
with O
friends O
mainly O
because O
of O
the O
reviews. O

Well O
firstly, O
I O
want O
to O
mention O
a O
small O
disappointment O
that O
grabbed O
me O
at O
once: O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

I O
really O
expected O
to O
see O
something O
more. O

I O
will O
not O
be O
tedious O
to O
describe O
what O
and O
how O
not O
so. O

I O
just O
had O
a O
feeling O
that O
such O
an O
interesting O
idea O
of O
a O
gangster B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
was O
not O
fully O
realized. O

Black O
and O
white O
posters, O
brick O
walls... O

Secondly: O
There O
was O
no O
guest B-TARGET
reception I-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
and O
we O
stood O
waiting...looked O
around O
while O
a O
couple O
of O
waiters B-TARGET
did O
their O
business... O

Waiting O
for O
any O
attention O
to O
us, O
went O
to O
the O
nearest O
girl-waiter, B-TARGET
and O
asked O
to O
put O
us O
at O
a O
table, O
ordered O
earlier. O

We O
were O
taken. O

We O
were O
seated. O

Things O
were O
better O
from O
there. O

Orders O
were O
taken O
quickly, O
the O
food O
is O
also O
brought O
quickly O
enough O
to O
remove O
the O
empty O
plates O
and O
glasses O
on O
time. O

The O
food B-TARGET
itself O
- O
the O
names O
match O
the O
style O
of O
the O
place. B-TARGET

Although O
in O
reality O
we O
don't O
offer O
anything O
special. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
smiling O
and O
friendly. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired-for O
fans O
of O
cheese O
there O
is O
just O
VERY O
little:) O

A O
plate O
of O
cabbage O
and O
three O
thin O
slices O
of O
chicken B-TARGET
(0,3 O
cm), O
dried O
croutons, O
sauce. O

Of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
nothing O
else O
caused O
complaints. O

As O
a O
result, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
conclude: O
the O
price-quality O
ratio O
is O
good. O

It O
is O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
big O
company. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
interesting. O

We O
visit O
it O
often O
enough O
and O
haven't O
been O
disappointed O
once. O

The O
interior O
is O
divided O
into O
three O
floors O
and O
each O
floor O
is O
different. O

I O
don't O
like O
the O
first O
floor. O

For O
some O
reason O
does O
not O
leave O
the O
feeling O
of O
a O
dining B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
(although O
in O
fact O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case). O

The O
chairs B-TARGET
are O
not O
comfortable. O

Lots O
of O
tables B-TARGET
in O
the O
middle. O

No O
sense O
of O
coziness. O

The O
third, O
as O
I O
understand O
it, O
is O
mainly O
for O
banquets... O
Nothing O
special O
either. O

But O
the O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy. O

Sofas... O

Dim O
lights... B-TARGET
and O
all O
that. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
quite O
varied. O

I O
like O
caesar B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
(very O
fresh, O
crispy O
and O
most O
importantly O
with O
very O
little B-TARGET
salted I-TARGET
fish). I-TARGET

Dijon-style O
beef. O

They O
bring O
it O
right O
in O
the O
pan O
baked O
with O
cheese B-TARGET
and O
tomatoes. B-TARGET

Very O
tasty. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
very O
good!!! O

The O
frozen B-TARGET
parfait I-TARGET
is O
a O
delight! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Sometimes O
they O
will O
screw O
up...but O
then O
they O
give O
you O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
of O
sorts. O

The O
prices O
are O
just O
above O
average. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
perfect O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
and O
birthday O
party O
for O
example. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
there O
again. O

I've O
read O
many O
reviews O
about O
this O
restaurant O
and O
decided O
to O
visit O
it. O

I O
expected O
a O
quiet O
horror, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
the O
opposite. O
Now O
I O
will O
not O
trust O
the O
reviews. O

I O
walked O
in O
on O
Thursday O
afternoon O
with O
a O
friend. O

We O
were O
met O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
took O
us O
to O
the O
lounge O
for O
non-smokers, O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O
After O
reading O
the O
reviews, O
I O
expected O
that O
I O
would O
sit O
in O
an O
empty O
room, O
but O
no, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
aisle, O
and O
there O
we O
sat. O

I O
ordered O
a O
salad, B-TARGET
a O
large O
portion, O
surprisingly O
enough O
it O
came O
in O
large O
quantities, O
of O
hot O
food O
I O
ordered O
steak B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
veal, I-TARGET
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
soft O
and O
juicy, O
and O
of O
course O
my O
favorite O
was O
the O
dessert, O
I O
ordered O
tiramisu, B-TARGET
and O
I O
did O
the O
right O
thing, O
a O
very O
tasty O
dessert. B-TARGET

I O
will O
always O
order O
tiramisu O
there. O

I O
found O
out O
that O
they O
were O
mistaken, O
but O
maybe O
I O
was O
just O
lucky O
and O
I O
will O
go O
there O
again. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
relaxed O
and O
informal, O
everything O
is O
neat O
and O
tidy, O
no O
pathos. O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
2009 O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
twice. O

No O
complaints O
about O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
interior B-TARGET
and O
beer. B-TARGET

Very O
cozy O
(do O
not O
forget O
- O
it's O
a O
beer O
restaurant O
with O
an O
atmosphere B-TARGET
inherent O
in O
such O
an O
institution). O

A O
rich O
menu B-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
to O
choose O
from. O

Dishes B-TARGET
to O
suit O
all O
tastes. O

Great O
dark B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
(I O
haven't O
tried O
light O
beer, O
I O
prefer O
dark O
beer). O

Somewhere O
came O
across O
a O
comment O
about O
slow O
and O
rude O
waitresses O
- O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case. O

Both O
times O
we O
were O
treated O
extremely O
politely O
and O
we O
were O
satisfied. O

Maybe O
a O
little O
longer O
than O
we O
would O
have O
liked, O
but O
firstly, O
it O
depends O
not O
only O
on O
waitresses, O
but O
also O
on O
cooks, O
and O
secondly, O
a O
long O
wait O
was O
compensated O
by O
politeness O
and O
attentiveness. O

There O
is O
only O
a O
question O
for O
the O
cooks. O

We O
ordered O
practically O
the O
same O
items O
both O
times O
but O
if O
at O
the O
first O
time O
everything O
was O
insanely O
delicious O
then O
at O
the O
second O
time O
we O
had O
an O
impression O
that O
students O
were O
cooking. O

Apparently O
we O
were O
on O
another O
shift. O

I O
can't O
say O
that O
the O
second O
time O
was O
inedible. O

It O
was O
okay. O

But O
no O
more. O

But O
the O
contrast O
with O
the O
first O
time O
is O
apparent. O

Even O
in O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
dishes. O

Maybe O
that O
second O
shift O
was O
offended O
that O
day O
by O
someone? O
:) O

In O
May O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
will O
go O
to O
St. O
Petersburg O
again O
and O
we O
will O
definitely O
go O
to O
"Gusynya". B-TARGET

Let's O
hope O
we O
get O
the O
"first" O
shift. O

I O
read O
the O
latest O
reviews, O
and O
was O
very O
surprised. O

The O
fact O
that O
I O
am O
a O
regular O
visitor O
to O
Tokyo B-TARGET
for O
several O
years, O
and O
I O
think O
that O
in O
our O
area O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places B-TARGET
to O
go. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
complaints O
about O
it O
yet. O

Very O
tasty O
food B-TARGET
(and O
most O
importantly-fresh O
fish!), B-TARGET
And O
quite O
inexpensive, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
diversify O
the O
Japanese B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
with O
European B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

Absolutely O
adequate O
staff, B-TARGET
pleasant O
interior. B-TARGET

The O
only O
flaw O
- O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
to O
make O
an O
order, O
and O
you O
can O
not O
find O
a O
free O
table, O
but O
we O
have O
always O
ordered O
a O
table O
over O
the O
phone, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
problems. O

Tokio, B-TARGET
we O
are O
with O
you! O
p.s. O
it O
is O
always O
crowded, O
I O
think O
it's O
an O
indication O
that O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad. O
so O
many O
people O
can O
not O
make O
a O
mistake O

Cozy O
and O
warm O
homely O
atmosphere B-TARGET
! O

Nice O
and O
helpful O
staff B-TARGET
, O
very O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
. O

The O
food B-TARGET
- O
needless O
to O
say, O
it's O
hard O
to O
surprise O
someone O
who O
is O
used O
to O
and O
knows O
Georgian O
food. O

One O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised! O

Thanks O
to O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
they O
manage O
to O
create O
a O
feeling O
that O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
special O
place B-TARGET
where O
everyone O
feels O
welcome! O
))))))))))) O

I O
love O
this O
place, B-TARGET
go O
there O
every O
week O
and O
I O
think O
I O
will O
go O
there O
again O
as O
it's O
perfect O
for O
me O
in O
every O
way. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
calm O
and O
comfortable, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
exactly O
as O
it O
should O
be, O
especially O
not O
attracting O
attention, O
but O
on O
the O
whole O
it O
is O
pleasant O
and O
unobtrusive, O
very O
relaxing, O
and O
the O
music B-TARGET
contributes O
to O
it. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
nice. O
Maybe O
because O
they O
all O
look O
familiar, O
I O
don't O
know, O
so O
that O
might O
be O
biased) O
but O
that O
was O
the O
impression O
I O
got O
the O
first O
time O
I O
was O
there. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
... O
is O
something O
else. O

All O
that O
I O
have O
tried O
in O
this O
place-great! O

Absolutely O
everything! O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
in O
particular O
is O
wonderful, O
I O
think O
everyone O
should O
try O
it. O

The O
food O
is O
massive O
and O
the O
dining B-TARGET
experience I-TARGET
is O
really O
good. O

Who O
hasn't O
been O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
yet, O
I O
think O
it's O
worth O
visiting O
for O
the O
panoramic B-TARGET
view, I-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
just O
to O
enjoy O
the O
relaxing O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
7th O
heaven. O

This O
weekend O
I O
celebrated O
my O
birthday O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

I O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
more O
comfortable O
seating. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
very O
soft. O

I O
liked O
the O
food O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
(beef B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
ruccola) I-TARGET
and O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
(pear B-TARGET
polo) I-TARGET
in O
particular. O

All O
the O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased, O
thank O
you O
very O
much! O

We O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
who O
answered O
all O
our O
questions O
with O
a O
smile. O

Definitely O
will O
come O
again! O

I O
came O
in O
after O
work O
to O
have O
dinner. O

Welcoming O
girls B-TARGET
met O
me O
and O
asked O
whether O
the O
table O
was O
booked. O

Table O
I O
have O
not O
reserved O
in O
advance, O
so O
accompanied O
me O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
and O
offered O
a O
seat O
near O
the O
stairs. O

Therefore, O
I O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
book O
a O
table O
in O
a O
more O
comfortable O
location. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
always O
looking O
after O
the O
customers, O
so O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long, O
which O
is O
very O
nice. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
is O
interesting O
and O
oriental O
but O
most O
importantly O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
affordable. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
I O
tasted O
fried B-TARGET
octopus I-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
there O
is O
nothing O
to O
compare O
it O
with, O
but O
I O
liked O
it)))). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
rather O
nice, O
there O
is O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
light, O
but O
there O
are O
candles B-TARGET
on O
the O
table. O

The O
walls O
create O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
wine O
cellar. O

I O
think O
if O
the O
goal O
is O
to O
find O
a O
cozy O
inexpensive O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
Moscow O
metro O
area, O
it's O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
best O
options. O

I O
think O
I O
will O
definitely O
go O
there O
again! O

Were O
there O
on O
Friday O
(19.03.10), O
ordered O
a O
table O
for O
parents' O
party O
on O
Sunday, O
so O
we O
tried O
some O
food O
there O
too. O

We O
had O
shashlik O
afghan, O
khachipuri O
from O
Imeriten, O
salad O
Bayram O
and O
grilled O
vegetables. O

Khachipuri B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
disappointing, O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
not O
enough O
cheese, B-TARGET
though O
probably O
to O
a O
connoisseur. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
is O
succulent O
and O
tasty, O
the O
lamb B-TARGET
and O
vegetables B-TARGET
are O
very O
worthy. O

Service B-TARGET
will O
leave O
a O
pleasant O
impression. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
is O
unobtrusive O
but O
courteous...a O
very O
good O
combination. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
unfortunately O
not O
appreciated...at O
a O
high O
level, O
but O
no O
more, O
though O
it O
may O
not O
be O
necessary O
for O
a O
nice O
lunch. B-TARGET

Parents O
were O
very O
satisfied. O

We O
would O
especially O
like O
to O
thank O
the B-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
who O
was O
working O
those O
days O
(sorry O
I O
didn't O
remember O
the O
girl's O
name). O

I O
really O
wanted O
my O
parents O
to O
like O
it O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

We O
were O
there O
on O
March O
8, O
and O
we O
were O
really O
surprised O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
food! B-TARGET

We O
used O
to O
go O
to O
a O
pub O
on O
Stachek O
until O
we O
were O
totally O
disappointed. O

Everything O
was O
ruined! O

The O
waiters O
work O
terrible, O
you O
cannot O
call O
them, O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
food O
- O
like O
in O
a O
canteen, O
something O
was O
cold, O
something O
unpalatable. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
there O
again. O
On O
March, O
8th O
were O
at O
friends' O
and O
they O
suggested O
we O
go O
to O
"bill-hook" O
in O
Kupchino. O

On O
March O
8, O
friends O
suggested O
we O
go O
to O
"bill-hook" O
in O
Kupchino. O
Once O
again O
I O
will O
say O
that O
we O
were O
surprised O
(in O
a O
good O
way). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
similar O
to O
the O
first O
pub, O
quite O
cozy: O
sofas, B-TARGET
a O
fireplace. B-TARGET

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
young B-TARGET
guy I-TARGET
and O
I O
must O
say O
that O
he O
was O
serving O
us O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
we O
didn't O
want O
to O
leave)))) O

With O
jokes, O
with O
a O
good O
attitude, O
quickly, O
tasty O
and O
of O
good O
quality. O

We O
all O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
we O
will O
be O
our O
regular O
guests! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
such O
a O
great O
place! B-TARGET

What O
can O
I O
say: O
"BAD, O
VERY O
BAD O
RESTAURANT!!!!". O
I O
read O
the O
reviews, O
I O
must O
be O
living O
on O
another O
planet, O
EVERYTHING O
written O
is O
a O
lie!!!! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
that O
it O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired......!!!!! O
I O
haven't O
seen O
anything O
like O
this O
in O
a O
long O
time. O

Okay, O
the O
first O
hall B-TARGET
is O
passable, O
but O
there O
are O
tables O
there, O
I O
hope O
they O
are O
always O
empty... O
It O
looks O
like O
a O
store O
with O
refrigerators O
with O
ice O
cream! O

The O
other O
two O
halls B-TARGET
are O
fine. O
Of O
course O
they O
are O
as O
good O
as O
they O
look... O
But O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
like O
that O
!!!!!. O

I O
ordered O
fried B-TARGET
eggplants I-TARGET
( O
in O
a O
sweet O
sauce) O
...I O
have O
something O
to O
compare O
it O
with..... O
I O
tasted O
it O
and O
was O
very O
disappointed(((( O
this O
is O
the O
worst... O
I've O
never O
eaten, O
they O
were O
bland O
(although O
in O
sauce), O
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
!!!! O
felt O
like O
everyone O
from O
the O
kitchen O
had O
blown O
their O
nose O
in O
it!!!!!! O

The O
size O
of O
the O
dish O
is O
not O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
for O
me. O

The O
size O
of O
dishes O
is O
not O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
in O
Chinese O
cuisine, O
the O
taste, O
the O
Taste!!!! O

A O
person O
should O
enjoy O
the O
meal, O
not O
think O
all O
night O
long O
what O
the O
sauce O
is O
made O
of!!! O

I'd O
like O
to O
think O
that O
people O
wrote O
the O
truth, O
and O
all O
I O
did O
was O
not O
believe O
it, O
but O
alas. O
I O
won't O
go O
there O
anymore!!!! O

Gentlemen! O
write O
the O
truth! O

P. O

S. O
only O
one O
review O
matched O
the O
truth, O
but O
she O
was O
luckier O
than O
me))))) O

Yesterday O
with O
friends, O
we O
decided O
all O
the O
same O
to O
visit, O
so O
vaunted O
institution, B-TARGET
but O
from O
the O
entrance, O
I O
began O
to O
be O
disappointed. O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
came O
in, O
no O
one O
was O
obliged O
to O
meet O
us O
on O
the O
first O
floor, O
there O
was O
someone's O
birthday, O
judging O
by O
all O
appearances, O
children's O
(although O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
Manilow, O
a O
place O
where O
you O
should O
arrange O
a O
children's O
party). O

Then O
we O
went O
up O
to O
the O
second O
floor, O
again O
no O
one O
met O
us O
and O
in O
general O
the O
restaurant O
was O
empty, O
only O
some O
company O
that O
allowed O
us O
to O
pass O
(who O
was O
it, O
no O
idea, O
or O
the O
administration, O
who O
had O
already O
begun O
to O
celebrate O
March O
8, O
or O
a O
very O
insolent O
guests). O

In O
about O
10 O
minutes O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
and O
took O
our O
order. O
We O
ordered O
cocktails, O
pasta, O
Greek O
salad O
with O
chicken. O

The O
order O
was O
a O
long O
wait, O
taking O
into O
account O
that O
pasta O
and O
salad O
are O
cooked O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
at O
the O
most, O
we O
waited O
for O
an O
hour. O

When O
I O
asked O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
how O
long O
to O
wait O
for O
our O
order, O
the O
answer O
was: O
"Well, O
I O
don't O
know, O
maybe O
10 O
minutes, O
we O
have O
a O
banquet O
downstairs O
and O
the O
chefs O
don't O
have O
time.......", O
to O
which O
I O
said O
that O
you O
are O
not O
justified, O
or O
should O
have O
warned. O

As O
for O
the O
food, O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
ok, O
pretty O
medium, O
a O
little O
salted, O
the O
caesar B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
good, O
weathered O
and O
cold O
pieces O
of O
chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
didn't O
inspire O
me O
much. O

Then O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
bill, O
it O
took O
as O
long O
to O
get O
it O
as O
the O
order. O

In O
general, O
not O
happy. O

Was O
at O
this O
restaurant O
yesterday! O

I O
didn't O
go O
there O
purposely, O
so O
I O
didn't O
know O
anything O
specific O
about O
this O
place.) O

I O
did O
not O
know O
anything O
specific O
about O
this O
place. O

There O
is O
a O
checkroom B-TARGET
and O
a O
nice O
checkroom B-TARGET
attendant, I-TARGET
then O
opens O
the O
view O
into O
the O
hall-good O
furniture B-TARGET
and O
a O
nice O
interior, B-TARGET
sad O
that O
there O
is O
no O
smoking B-TARGET
area! I-TARGET

Welcomed O
well O
(no O
smile O
on O
the O
face O
of O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
was O
not), O
showed O
the O
table. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
is O
not O
guided O
in O
the O
menu, O
he O
does O
not O
see O
the O
tables, O
from O
the O
hands O
of O
all O
the O
fallen, O
dirty O
dishes O
were O
on O
the O
table O
for O
10 O
minutes O
and O
it's O
in O
an O
incomplete O
room! O

The O
food: O
Japanese O
cuisine: O
we O
ate O
Japanese O
dishes.) O

Cuisine: O
Japanese, B-TARGET
tasty O
food B-TARGET
and O
large O
portions B-TARGET
and O
usual O
serving. B-TARGET

And O
Caesar B-TARGET
salad-also I-TARGET
tasty! O

The O
lack O
of O
cards O
do O
not O
make O
discount O
for O
regular O
guests O
- O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
it's O
good! O

Provided O
all O
staff, B-TARGET
with O
a O
smile O
and O
a O
friendly O
face! O

It's O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
a O
good O
time O
with O
a O
large O
group. O

We O
went O
there O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
with O
some O
friends. O

We O
took O
a O
table O
and O
after O
5 O
minutes O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
took O
our O
order. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
very O
large, O
so O
there O
is O
something O
to O
treat O
yourself. O

There O
was O
a O
nice O
selection O
of O
desserts! B-TARGET

I O
got O
myself O
a O
tiramisu, B-TARGET
it O
was O
delicious! O

I O
had O
tasted O
this O
kind O
of O
cake O
only O
in O
Italy, O
surprisingly O
the O
cake B-TARGET
was O
soft O
and O
fluffy, O
just O
finger-licking! O

And O
the O
second O
course O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
about O
30 O
minutes O
- O
this O
is O
not O
good, O
of O
course, O
but O
it O
was O
worth O
it! O

A O
friend O
ordered O
steak B-TARGET
ribeye, I-TARGET
in O
his O
words, O
it O
was O
just O
amazing, O
but O
a O
friend O
ordered O
a O
pork B-TARGET
knuckle, I-TARGET
she O
was O
a O
bit O
dry. O

It's O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
the O
prices O
are O
reasonable, O
not O
expensive. O

The O
service, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
leaves O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired, O
I O
wish O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
would O
work O
quicker, O
but O
as O
it O
was O
crowded O
we O
tried O
to O
walk O
in O
their O
shoes. O

All O
in O
all O
a O
good O
pub B-TARGET
imbued O
with O
soccer O
themes. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
hang O
out O
in O
a O
noisy O
group. O

Well, O
visited O
Chaplin O
Hall, O
I O
will O
share O
my O
impressions. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
good, O
it O
would O
not O
be O
quite O
correct O
to O
say O
it O
was O
a O
restaurant, O
it O
is O
rather O
a O
concert O
hall O
with O
a O
possibility O
to O
order O
food O
and O
drinks. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
very O
spacious O
and O
atmospheric O
and O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
space. B-TARGET

There O
are O
comfortable O
tables B-TARGET
for O
a O
small O
company O
of O
friends. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
quite O
diverse, O
there O
is O
a O
separate O
menu O
with O
Japanese O
cuisine, O
but O
it O
is O
up O
to O
a O
taste. O

For O
me, O
for O
example, O
I O
prefer O
the O
traditional O
cuisine. O

There O
are O
mixed O
dishes, O
for O
example, O
herring O
under O
a O
fur O
coat... O
with O
crab. O

I O
haven't O
tried O
it, O
but O
the O
name O
caught O
my O
fancy. O

I O
tasted O
baked B-TARGET
halibut O
- O
it O
was O
good O
and O
looked O
wonderful O
on O
the O
plate. O

Though, O
this O
plate O
is O
much O
bigger O
than O
halibut O
itself. O

Apparently, O
this O
is O
the O
custom). O

Mushroom O
salad B-TARGET
is O
also O
good, O
we O
had O
a O
decent O
portion. B-TARGET

Coffee B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
- O
also O
no O
complaints, O
all O
delicious. O

All O
in O
all O
a O
pleasant O
evening O
in O
good O
company O
in O
a O
good O
place. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
it! O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
went O
to O
"Nebo" O
at O
about O
19:00 O
on O
February O
9. O

We O
were O
met O
at O
the O
entrance O
by O
an O
unpleasant O
young B-TARGET
receptionist. I-TARGET

To O
be O
honest O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
surprised. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
we O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
and O
all O
the O
time O
we O
were O
met O
by O
such O
beautiful O
girls. O

Well, O
okay, O
let's O
move O
on. O

At O
this O
time O
of O
day O
there O
were O
not O
many O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

And O
there O
was O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
seats O
in O
front O
of O
us. O

We O
were O
offered O
soft O
and O
comfortable O
sofas. B-TARGET

Of O
course O
not O
by O
the O
window, O
but O
still O
the O
view B-TARGET
was O
beautiful O
as O
always. O

Just O
five O
minutes O
later O
a O
friendly O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
up O
to O
us O
and O
took O
our O
order. O

In O
about O
15 O
minutes O
we O
were O
already O
enjoying O
a O
warm B-TARGET
Mexican I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and O
carpaccio B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
duck I-TARGET
breast. I-TARGET

The O
cold B-TARGET
appetizer I-TARGET
and O
salad B-TARGET
were O
great! O

The B-TARGET
main I-TARGET
course O
was O
very O
satisfying O
as O
well. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
always O
attentive O
and O
helpful. O

He O
always O
showed O
up O
when O
we O
needed O
him O
to. O

He O
did O
not O
bore O
us O
or O
leave O
us O
on O
our O
own. O

Everything O
was O
perfect. O

We O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

We O
will O
come O
again O
and O
again O
many O
times.) O

When O
this O
restaurant O
opened O
right O
next O
to O
my O
house, O
I O
was O
very O
happy, O
because O
Patio O
on O
Nevsky O
and O
Planet O
Sushi O
have O
always O
been O
a O
joy. O

When O
it O
was O
time O
to O
choose O
a O
place O
for O
celebration O
of O
my O
birthday O
I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
think O
much. O

We O
came.....were O
welcomed O
well O
and O
seated O
at O
a O
cozy O
table B-TARGET
in O
the O
corner.... O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
brought O
the O
menu O
and....... O
disappeared, O
20 O
minutes O
passed, O
my O
friends O
were O
ready O
to O
go O
to O
the O
kitchen O
themselves O
for O
food.... O

Finally O
they O
took O
our O
order, O
instead O
of O
freshly O
squeezed O
juice O
they O
brought O
us O
an O
ordinary O
juice O
from O
the O
box, O
martini O
with O
ice, O
but O
without O
the O
tongs O
(looking O
at O
a O
previous O
comment O
I O
can O
say O
that O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
custom O
here) O
........ O

Different O
waiters B-TARGET
came O
to O
the O
table O
all O
the O
time, O
maybe O
3 O
or O
4??????????????? O

There O
was O
screaming O
and O
weird O
crackling O
in O
the O
kitchen... O

When O
they O
brought O
the O
bill O
DOES O
NOT O
INCLUDE O
TIPS, O
but O
we O
were O
not O
given O
change O
(this O
is O
also O
the O
norm O
here O
apparently), O
and O
it O
was O
not O
small, O
certainly O
not O
10% O
of O
the O
order(((. O

A O
large O
restaurant, B-TARGET
a O
good O
and O
most O
importantly O
quite O
profitable O
place B-TARGET
and O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
very O
decent, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired.... O

I O
visited O
this O
place O
because O
of O
my O
dad's O
anniversary. O

We O
chose O
this O
place O
because O
we O
live O
nearby, O
and O
the O
guests O
arrived O
from O
other O
cities, O
so O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
somewhere O
in O
the O
city O
center. O

So, O
let's O
start O
with O
the O
interior. O

For O
this O
area, O
or O
rather O
the O
location, O
where O
there O
are O
no O
decent O
places O
to O
stay. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
pleasant. O

And O
we O
were O
met O
and O
taken O
to O
the O
table, O
and O
what O
was O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
just O
a O
miracle, O
friendly, O
attentive, O
but O
most O
importantly O
all O
in O
moderation, O
it O
was O
not O
too O
much, O
but O
she O
did O
her O
job O
at O
100%, O
if O
not O
200%. O

Let's O
move O
on O
to O
the O
kitchen. O

Ordered O
a O
lot, O
you O
know O
the O
anniversary. O

But, O
oh, O
the O
horror, O
there O
was O
a O
shock. O

Yes, O
the O
first O
perception O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
is O
great, O
decor, O
some O
kind O
of O
finds O
of O
cooks. O

But, O
on O
the O
taste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

No, O
not O
that O
it O
was O
disgusting, O
but O
none O
of O
the O
judo O
was O
not O
good O
enough. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
dry, O
the O
fish B-TARGET
is O
not O
salted, O
which O
can O
not O
be O
said O
about O
alcohol. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

The O
quality O
of O
wines B-TARGET
also O
pleased. O

In O
general, O
if O
you O
go O
there O
purposely O
- O
it O
is O
better O
not O
to O
go, O
but O
if O
you O
just O
passed O
by O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
in, O
for O
curiosity's O
sake, O
you O
can. O

But O
I'm O
afraid O
the O
comments O
afterwards O
will O
not O
be O
the O
best. O

A O
friend O
highly O
recommended O
this O
place. B-TARGET

And O
as O
it O
is O
well O
located O
- O
in O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
areas B-TARGET
of O
the O
city O
- O
I O
got O
to O
him O
quickly. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
liked O
it: O
there O
were O
not O
too O
many O
people, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
attentive, O
her O
order O
was O
brought O
quickly. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
impressed O
me: O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
interesting O
desserts, B-TARGET
a O
huge O
choice O
of O
alcoholic B-TARGET
cocktails I-TARGET
... O
However, O
the O
prices O
are O
far O
from O
low, O
especially O
for O
main O
course B-TARGET
and O
salads. B-TARGET

Slightly O
above O
average O
it O
is O
called, O
probably. O

But O
I O
was O
disappointed O
during O
the O
following O
times: O
there O
are O
almost O
no O
free B-TARGET
seats, I-TARGET
waiters B-TARGET
don't O
have O
time O
for O
anything, O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
almost O
never O
available... O

But O
anyway, O
I O
like O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
place. O

And O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
amazing O
after O
all. O

By O
the O
way, O
last O
time O
I O
ate O
pasta B-TARGET
4 I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
taste O
and O
portion O
size) O

I've O
never O
taken O
this O
place O
seriously, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
go O
there O
often... O

BUT... O
I O
used O
to O
go O
there O
for O
a O
drink O
or O
a O
quick O
snack, O
but O
not O
so O
long O
ago O
I O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
full O
meal O
there. O

I O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
impressions O
were O
only O
positive, O
not O
without O
curiosities, O
but.... O
nevertheless, O
I O
was O
satisfied. O

Welcomed O
warmly, O
no O
criticism O
here O
and O
never O
was, O
to O
the O
table O
did O
not O
carry O
out, O
not O
a O
minus O
(left O
the O
right O
to O
choose O
for O
me))). O
). O

It O
was O
in O
the O
evening, O
so O
lit O
candles, B-TARGET
dimmed O
the O
light O
and..... O
Ladies O
and O
gentlemen, O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
it O
became O
so O
cozy O
that O
I O
would O
never O
have O
thought O
that O
this O
institution B-TARGET
in O
the O
daylight O
looks O
like O
a O
cafe. O

In O
short, O
the O
dim B-TARGET
light, I-TARGET
soft O
music, B-TARGET
nice O
and O
caring O
staff B-TARGET
- O
did O
their O
job O
- O
made O
you O
relax)))). O

I O
will O
not O
say O
much O
about O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
- O
everything O
is O
worthy. O

"Caprese B-TARGET
Caprese, I-TARGET
medallions, B-TARGET
Caesar. B-TARGET
Caprese, O
medallions, O
Caesar, O
rolls B-TARGET
- O
did O
not O
make O
special O
delight, O
but O
also O
criticism, O
and O
this O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(I O
repeat) O
made O
an O
indelible O
impression. O

I O
recommend O
especially O
to O
those O
who O
were O
there O
in O
the O
daytime, O
come O
in O
the O
evening, O
believe O
me, O
you O
will O
get O
into O
an O
absolutely O
different O
institution. B-TARGET

Thanks O
especially O
to O
Irina O
for O
her O
attentive O
and O
polite O
service. B-TARGET

I've O
decided O
for O
myself O
that O
I O
will O
be O
back O
again O
and O
again. O

Thank O
you! O

I've O
been O
to O
three O
different O
restaurants O
Mama O
Roma. O

Cuisine B-TARGET
pleases, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
good. O

Dishes O
either O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
be O
cooked, O
or O
they O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
be O
served, O
although O
there O
weren't O
many O
people O
there O
twice. O

Once O
we O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
they O
had O
forgotten O
about O
us. O

But O
worse O
than O
that O
something O
from O
the O
menu O
was O
out O
of O
stock O
all O
the O
time O
- O
and, O
as O
if O
to O
spite O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
really O
wanted O
to O
try O
it! O

The O
choice O
of O
desserts B-TARGET
is O
very O
small. O

Pasta B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone. O

But O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
is O
not O
so O
good O
- O
ordinary, O
nothing O
special. O

Not O
worth O
the O
money O
they O
charge O
for O
it. O

Last O
Saturday O
we O
visited O
this O
place O
with O
friends. O

It O
all O
started O
with O
not O
very O
pleasant O
moments, O
because O
when O
we O
got O
there, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
there O
were O
no O
free O
tables, O
and O
only O
after O
probably O
20 O
minutes O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
found O
us O
a O
suitable O
table. O

Overall O
we O
liked O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
menu. B-TARGET

From O
the O
pluses: O
quick O
service B-TARGET
despite O
the O
huge O
number O
of O
people, O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(DJs O
playing) O
for O
a O
Saturday O
night, O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
alcoholic B-TARGET
beverages I-TARGET
(although O
we O
never O
ate O
but O
plenty O
of O
alcohol O
was O
drunk)))). O

Cons: O
It O
seemed O
that O
too O
loud O
music B-TARGET
played, O
lack O
of O
lighting B-TARGET
over I-TARGET
the O
table O
(although O
over O
several O
others O
the O
light O
was) O
which O
led O
to O
highlight O
the O
menu O
with O
the O
phone O
and O
probably O
the O
main O
minus O
for O
me O
is O
that O
in O
such O
a O
large O
place B-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
place O
for O
a O
closet B-TARGET
which O
led O
to O
our O
jackets O
constantly O
falling O
to O
the O
floor O
from O
the O
couch. O

For O
our O
table O
they O
asked O
for O
a O
deposit B-TARGET
of O
5 O
ths, O
but O
for O
a O
large O
company O
that's O
not O
too O
much, O
for O
example, O
we O
left O
8 O
ths O
there. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
minuses O
we O
were O
quite O
satisfied O
with O
this O
place B-TARGET
and O
I O
think O
that O
we O
will O
visit O
this O
place O
many O
times O
again. O

Well O
and O
a O
nice O
little O
thing O
at O
the O
end, O
we O
asked O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
a O
discount O
card O
and O
he O
gave O
it O
to O
us. O

So O
that O
will O
be O
another O
reason O
to O
come O
in O
and O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
discount). O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
two O
times. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
they O
change O
tablecloths O
after O
each O
visitor, O
everything O
is O
very O
clean. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
well O
prepared O
and O
can O
tell O
you O
what O
to O
cook O
and O
how O
to O
serve O
it. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
quite O
large. O

Everything O
is O
delicious! O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
on O
holidays O
and O
weekends O
they O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
visitors, O
although O
that O
says O
that O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
good... O

And O
that's O
why O
they O
cook O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time! O

The O
appetizers O
and O
salads O
are O
brought O
quickly, O
but O
the O
hot O
meal O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
for. O

They O
brought O
us O
an O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
for O
the O
kid O
as O
a O
compliment O
for O
the O
wait. O

By O
the O
way, O
they O
make O
ice B-TARGET
cream O
themselves! O

Very O
tasty! O

Hi. O

I O
was O
in O
this O
BAR O
28.10.09, O
I O
can O
tell O
that O
service B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
especial O
does O
not O
stand O
out, O
beer B-TARGET
is O
expensive O
enough O
and O
then O
beer O
"Beresta B-TARGET
light" I-TARGET
220r O
I O
did O
not O
really O
like, O
but O
here O
snacks B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
I O
really O
liked O
and O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
their O
large O
selection O
with O
the O
predominance O
of O
meat, O
which O
for O
me O
personally O
is O
very O
important. O

This O
bar O
is O
suitable O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
watch O
soccer, O
drink O
beer O
because O
for O
drinking O
other O
drinks O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
place, O
because O
alcohol O
here O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
in O
some O
restaurants O
where O
you O
will O
find O
better O
service, O
live O
music, O
and O
a O
larger O
selection O
of O
dishes O
that O
fit O
to O
drinking O
alcoholic O
beverages, O
very O
suitable O
for O
those O
who O
just O
want O
to O
socialize O
in O
a O
relaxed O
atmosphere. O

I O
was O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
recently O
with O
friends O
in O
the O
afternoon O
and O
everything O
was O
great. O

They O
were O
welcomed O
and O
offered O
to O
choose O
a O
table, O
not O
very O
crowded O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
nice. O

Waitress B-TARGET
came O
right O
away, O
dark O
hair, O
can't O
remember O
her O
name O
unfortunately. O
Great O
service B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant, O
can't O
say O
a O
word O
about O
it! O

On O
my O
request O
to O
help O
me O
choose O
a O
dish, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
was O
happy O
to O
offer O
us O
a O
couple O
of O
salads O
and O
hot O
dishes, O
cooked O
all O
very O
quickly O
and O
all O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

Very O
glad O
that O
I O
came O
here, O
even O
though O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
far O
to O
the O
place, O
but O
I O
didn't O
regret O
it O
once, O
I O
will O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
all O
my O
friends. O

Good O
time O
to O
you!!! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
a O
big O
roll B-TARGET
that O
won't O
even O
fit O
in O
your O
mouth, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place O
for O
you. O

They O
have O
great O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
selection O
of O
other O
european B-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

In O
general, O
the O
institution B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad O
about O
a O
year O
ago, O
without O
having O
ordered O
a O
table O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
find O
places O
even O
on O
weekdays, O
now O
there O
are O
almost O
always O
places, O
and O
in O
summer O
even O
helps O
the O
veranda. B-TARGET

At O
the O
prices O
I O
can O
say O
that O
if O
you O
eat O
and O
rolls O
and O
any O
other O
dish, O
dessert, O
cold O
drinks O
will O
be O
1450-1750r O
per O
person, O
but O
so O
much O
food B-TARGET
not O
everyone O
can O
eat O
so O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
big O
appetite, O
and O
so O
can O
750 O
p O
enough O
to O
eat. O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
two O
years O
now. O
The O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
hasn't O
changed O
and O
regularity O
is O
a O
sign O
of O
professionalism. O

I O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
several O
times O
and O
my O
impressions O
are O
as O
follows: O
1) O

The O
food. O

It O
is O
rather O
monotonous O
food B-TARGET
as O
in O
many O
other O
Chinese O
restaurants O
(the O
fish, B-TARGET
the O
meat B-TARGET
- O
all O
for O
the O
same O
taste, O
all O
with O
the O
same O
sauce), B-TARGET
all O
edible, O
but O
not O
very O
tasty. O

Of O
the O
desserts O
I O
liked O
the O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
garbanzilla I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
(but O
of O
course O
not O
of O
their O
making) O
2) O

Service. O

It O
all O
depends O
on O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
there O
are O
friendly O
and O
not O
so O
friendly. O
3) O

Ambience. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
poor, O
on O
the O
floor O
there O
is O
linoleum. B-TARGET

Music B-TARGET
is O
too O
loud O
and O
obtrusive. O

Playing O
Russian B-TARGET
radio I-TARGET
- O
and O
it's O
awful! O

I O
walked O
into O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
first O
impression O
I O
got O
was O
that O
it O
was O
very O
busy, O
not O
very O
crowded, O
and O
there O
were O
always O
lots O
of O
empty O
seats. O

Entered O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
the O
first O
impression O
is O
excellent, O
but O
the O
truth O
that O
at O
once O
didn't O
like O
it O
is O
that O
in O
advance O
we O
ordered O
a O
table O
at O
a O
window, O
but O
we O
were O
seated O
in O
the O
most O
awful O
place! O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
nice, O
not O
intrusive, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
great! O

As O
for O
the O
food, B-TARGET
honestly, O
I O
did O
not O
like O
it((. O

The O
meat O
waited O
for O
about O
30 O
minutes, O
if O
not O
more.... O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
great, O
so O
is O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
good. O

I O
had O
a O
friend O
and O
four O
of O
us O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

What O
can O
I O
say: O
1. O

1. O
I O
liked O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant, O
sociable O
and O
friendly, O
at O
our O
request O
she O
took O
our O
picture O
without O
a O
problem, O
the O
food O
was O
fast, O
extra O
plates O
didn't O
linger O
on O
the O
table O
either. O

The O
checkroom O
mister B-TARGET
too O
very O
polite O
and O
all O
others O
who O
have O
seen O
the O
staff B-TARGET
have O
made O
a O
good O
impression. O
2. O

2. O
We O
were O
at O
15-30 O
on O
Sunday O
and O
there O
were O
no O
people O
there. O

Rooms B-TARGET
are O
big O
and O
well O
furnished. B-TARGET
Large O
TV B-TARGET
on O
the O
wall O
makes O
it O
easy O
to O
watch O
from O
any O
table. O
3. O

At O
first O
we O
wanted O
to O
order O
Czech B-TARGET
alcohol, I-TARGET
but O
we O
didn't O
have O
any, O
so O
we O
got O
upset O
a O
little, O
but O
not O
really. O

We O
ordered O
whisky O
- O
it O
was O
ok, O
we O
liked O
it. O

We O
also O
ordered O
our O
meat, O
and O
cabbage O
stew O
with O
meat. O

No O
complaints O
about O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

Nothing O
super O
cool, O
but O
on O
a O
high O
level. O

Overall, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice. O

Went O
here O
a O
month O
ago O
because O
many O
people O
recommended O
it O
as O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
stay. O

Yes, O
indeed, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
pleasant. O

Like O
most O
friends O
who O
visited O
the O
place, B-TARGET
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
very O
conducive O
to O
a O
friendly, O
warm O
communication. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
on O
par O
and O
what O
was O
nice O
- O
portions B-TARGET
are O
big)). O

If O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
minuses O
of O
this O
restaurant, O
very O
crowded O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
there O
in O
the O
evening, O
be O
sure O
to O
book O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

We O
went O
on O
October O
15. O

We O
had O
a O
wedding O
for O
two. O

We O
were O
really O
impressed. O

Really, O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
one. O

Especially O
surprising O
for O
a O
bedroom O
community. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
impressive O
- O
very O
neat, O
beautiful O
and O
classy. O

Tables B-TARGET
were O
placed O
far O
away O
from O
each O
other O
and O
visitors O
don't O
disturb O
each O
other, O
you O
can O
neither O
see O
nor O
hear O
them. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
great! O

There O
were O
two O
waiters O
and O
our O
table O
was O
served O
by O
a O
young O
guy O
by O
the O
name O
of O
( O

Artem, O
Marat?) O
sorry, O
I O
forget O
the O
name O
because O
of O
the O
age:) O

The O
service O
was O
of O
the O
highest O
class: O
courteous, O
polite, O
and O
unobtrusive. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
excellent: O
salads B-TARGET
were O
unusual, O
tasty, O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
quite O
decent O
in O
size. O

The B-TARGET
hot O
food O
is O
amazing. O

Veal O
medallions B-TARGET
are O
fantastic, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
melts O
in O
the O
mouth, O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Duck B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
orange I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
also O
a O
success. O

Dessert, B-TARGET
bese B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
fruit, I-TARGET
too, O
was O
pretty O
good, O
though O
at O
the O
very O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
- O
we O
got O
tired O
of O
eating:) O

The O
result: O
2 O
glasses O
of O
cognac O
50 O
gr. O
3 O
glasses O
of O
red O
wine, O
100g. O

Whiskey O
2 O
salads O
2 O
hot O
dishes O
1 O
dessert O
2 O
espressos O
Result O
together O
with O
the O
tip: O
5000= O
Great O
impressions! O

Thank O
you. O

Would O
recommend O
to O
anyone. O

The O
other O
day, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Terrace, O
which O
I O
hadn't O
been O
to O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
months. O

I O
missed O
it). O

Went O
in O
with O
a O
small O
group O
of O
women O
at O
about O
9:00. O

The O
crowd O
was O
really O
glamorous O
and O
the O
whole O
place O
was O
decked O
out O
with O
jewelry O
and O
brands. O

I O
like O
stylish O
glamour O
(I O
don't O
know O
if O
that's O
a O
good O
word), O
not... O
pink. O

I O
mean, O
there O
were O
two O
ladies O
sitting O
at O
the O
next O
table, O
head O
to O
toe O
in O
pink. O

Very O
funny, O
very O
funny). O

At O
about O
11 O
o'clock O
(we O
were O
sitting O
for O
quite O
a O
long O
time) O
three O
young O
people O
came O
over O
to O
get O
acquainted. O

We O
did O
not O
get O
acquainted, O
but O
luckily O
they O
didn't O
spoil O
our O
mood. O

Our B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
nice, O
attentive O
and O
didn't O
look O
at O
us O
in O
a O
judgemental O
way, O
so O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
hours. O

Service B-TARGET
in O
Terrace O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
you O
can't O
have O
it O
every O
time. O

This O
time O
we O
were O
lucky. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
on O
the O
level O
as O
always. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
interesting O
and O
varied. O

Salads B-TARGET
and O
pasta B-TARGET
are O
great. O

The O
alcohol B-TARGET
is O
really O
tasty). O

The O
prices O
are O
affordable. O

In O
general, O
Terraza B-TARGET
is O
not O
a O
disappointment O
and O
continues O
to O
be O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
places. O

Today O
I O
visited O
this O
place O
with O
a O
friend! O
I O
liked O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
pleased O
at O
the O
entrance, O
friendly O
and O
smiling O
administrator B-TARGET
Catherine O
met O
us O
and O
took O
us O
to O
a O
very O
nice O
table, B-TARGET
which O
opened O
a O
great O
view. B-TARGET

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
girl-waiter. B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
fondue B-TARGET
and O
were O
served O
very O
quickly O
without O
affecting O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dish. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
know O
their O
job O
very O
well. O

Well O
done. O

Now O
the O
"Artist's B-TARGET
Attic" I-TARGET
will O
be O
a O
frequently O
visited O
place O
in O
our O
city. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
good O
mood O
for O
the O
whole O
day!!!! O

I O
want O
to O
leave O
my O
feedback O
about O
this O
wonderful O
cafe. B-TARGET

We O
celebrated O
my O
mother's O
birthday, O
everything O
was O
just O
great! O

No O
one O
was O
left O
unsatisfied, O
we O
all O
really O
liked O
the O
food! B-TARGET

Large O
portions, B-TARGET
interesting O
salads B-TARGET
and O
hot B-TARGET
dishes, O
everything O
was O
very O
hearty O
and O
tasty O
for O
a O
relatively O
low O
price! O

Very O
nice O
unobtrusive O
service! B-TARGET

A O
special O
thanks O
to O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Sergey! O

I O
have O
only O
good O
memories! O

And O
what O
a O
great O
cake B-TARGET
we O
had! O

I O
recommend O
everyone O
to O
visit O
this O
wonderful O
cafe! B-TARGET

Perfect O
for O
small O
banquets! O

Cozy O
and O
at O
home! O

We O
celebrated O
my O
husband's O
birthday O
in O
Karavan-Saray. O

At O
first O
we O
planned O
our O
celebration O
elsewhere, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
empty O
tables O
there O
and O
therefore O
by O
the O
will O
of O
fate O
we O
chose O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
room O
is O
not O
large, O
but O
very O
cosy. O

We O
booked O
a O
table O
behind O
a O
screen O
by O
the O
window O
so O
that O
nobody O
interfered. O

We O
can't O
say O
a O
word O
about O
the O
waiter's B-TARGET
service. O

He O
did O
everything O
fast, O
high O
quality O
and O
most O
importantly O
unnoticeable. O

Food: O
We O
decided O
to O
order O
a O
large O
plate O
of O
kazan O
kabob O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
standard O
dishes O
(shurvy O
and O
flatbread O
....). O

It O
takes O
1.5 O
hours O
to O
cook, O
but O
is O
very O
delicious! O

In O
general O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
were O
made O
of O
fresh O
quality O
products B-TARGET
.so O
in O
summary O
I O
will O
say O
that O
you O
can O
really O
eat O
there O
tasty, O
but O
when O
you O
pay O
the O
bill, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
just O
did O
not O
bring O
back O
the O
change!!!!!!! O

Apparently O
he O
thought O
that O
we O
should O
leave O
him O
1000 O
rubles O
of O
change O
for O
a O
tip! O

And O
even O
when O
we O
tried O
to O
call O
him O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food, O
he O
just O
turned O
away O
and O
went O
to O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
hall. O

Apparently O
he O
was O
afraid O
that O
we O
would O
take O
the O
money O
:)) O

In O
my O
opinion O
is O
not O
very O
nice. O

In O
general, O
often O
go O
there O
for O
dinner O
after O
work O
with O
my O
husband. O

Very O
much O
like O
the O
quiet O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
quiet O
background O
music B-TARGET
does O
not O
disturb O
the O
conversation, O
always O
have O
a O
free O
table. B-TARGET

I O
do O
not O
really O
understand O
people O
who O
complain O
about O
it. O

I O
am O
much O
quieter O
and O
more O
comfortable O
to O
eat O
in O
a O
place O
where O
people O
do O
not O
crowd, O
there O
is O
no O
noise O
and O
rush. O

I O
like O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
too O
if O
you O
take O
Japanese O
food O
in O
St. O
Petersburg. O

Very O
acceptable O
and O
for O
more O
than O
reasonable O
prices. O

I O
do O
not O
have O
any O
fears O
about O
the O
fish. B-TARGET

Of O
course O
I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
a O
bigger O
assortment O
of O
rolls, B-TARGET
but O
I O
like O
them O
very O
much. O

The O
soups B-TARGET
are O
always O
super! O

And O
very O
good O
freshly B-TARGET
squeezed I-TARGET
juices. I-TARGET

There O
is O
a O
small O
European O
menu O
now. O

It's O
not O
bad O
either. O

Bacon O
dumplings B-TARGET
are O
very O
good O
and O
the O
portion O
is O
really O
"manly". O

We O
are O
lucky O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Once O
we O
were O
displeased O
with O
inexperienced O
waitress, B-TARGET
but O
never O
saw O
her O
again. O

Usually O
they O
do O
everything O
quickly, O
do O
not O
leave O
without O
attention O
and O
warn O
us O
if O
something O
on O
the O
menu O
will O
have O
to O
wait. O

The O
first O
time O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
half O
an O
hour, O
for O
which O
we O
received O
a O
discount O
card. O

Discounts O
are O
always O
given O
even O
if O
you O
don't O
have O
your O
card O
with O
you O
(they O
are O
found O
by O
name). O

In O
general O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
satisfactory O
- O
unobtrusive O
but O
attentive. O

It O
is O
the O
only O
place B-TARGET
in O
St O
Petersburg O
where O
I O
can O
eat O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls, B-TARGET
in O
spite O
of O
my O
pregnancy. O

In O
other O
places O
I O
am O
wary)))) O

No, O
the O
avatar O
is O
not O
a O
photo O
of O
the O
bartender)) O
so, O
asked O
for O
more O
details... O

I'll O
try) O
from O
the O
street O
it O
is O
almost O
not O
visible, O
and O
the B-TARGET
sign I-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
dispose O
to O
go O
inside O
... O
So O
would O
not O
have O
gone O
in, O
honestly. O

But O
friends O
called. O
And O
I O
was O
not O
sorry! O
Inside, O
very O
cool! O
There O
are O
not O
enough O
seats, O
even O
I O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
it's O
a O
plus O
or O
minus.Literally O
5-6 O
tables, B-TARGET
and O
a B-TARGET

a O
very O
cozy) O
most O
classy-table B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O

in O
a O
corner, O
with O
a O
couch B-TARGET
and O

Menu. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
good. O
There O
is O
a O
good O
selection O
of O
bar O
food. B-TARGET

The O
menu O
is O
good. O
The O
bar B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
has O
a O
lot O
to O
choose O
from. O
The O

seem O
high O
to O
me. O

15 O

no O

the O

the O

great) O
in O

Sitting O
behind O
the B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
and O
having O
a O
heart-to-heart O
talk O
with O
the O
friendly O
bartender B-TARGET
was O
great!) O

We O
celebrated O
our O
tenth O
wedding O
anniversary O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
and O
our O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
quiet, O
comfortable O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

I O
especially O
liked O
how O
delicious O
tiramisu B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
was O
prepared. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
such O
a O
tasty O
dessert B-TARGET
in O
any O
restaurant. O

We O
left O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
and O
rested. O

My O
husband O
will O
have O
his O
birthday O
soon O
and O
we O
will O
celebrate O
it O
here. O

A O
week O
ago O
we O
came O
to O
look O
at O
the O
new O
place. O

We O
ordered O
a O
table O
but O
we O
didn't O
need O
to O
order O
it, O
there O
were O
free O
tables. O

There O
are O
two O
halls O
in O
the O
restaurant O
and O
a O
room O
for O
karaoke O
(we O
didn't O
manage O
to O
see O
it, O
it O
works O
not O
every O
day). O

We O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
room O
- O
it O
was O
cosy O
and O
beautifully O
furnished. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
big, O
prices O
are O
typical O
for O
an O
average O
city. O

We O
were O
explained O
the O
absence O
of O
ordered O
salads O
because O
of O
great O
demand O
:-) O

Several O
surprised O
a O
huge O
number O
of O
staff B-TARGET
in O
the O
recalculation O
per O
square O
meter. O
Our O
table O
was O
served O
by O
two, O
although O
we O
were O
at O
the O
table O
only O
5 O
people. O

By O
halls O
constantly O
walks O
personnel B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance O
are O
a O
few O
"meet". O

Apparently O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
restaurant O
doesn't O
feel O
the O
crisis O
yet... O

As O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
salads B-TARGET
we O
didn't O
have O
any O
complaints O
but O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
not O
impressive O
as O
it O
seemed O
to O
us O
that O
they O
were O
not O
prepared O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Probably O
we O
will O
have O
to O
come O
again O
to O
see O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
development... O

First O
time O
we O
stopped O
by O
Quay B-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
VERY O
happy O
with O
the O
evening O
we O
had!!! O
there O
was O
not O
a O
single O
negative O
moment, O
which O
is O
rare! O
=) O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
huge!!! O
But O
it O
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
there O
is O
really O
lots O
of O
room! O

Tables B-TARGET
aren't O
packed, O
I O
think O
even O
with O
a O
large O
number O
of O
people, O
visitors O
don't O
feel O
like O
herrings O
in O
a O
barrel O
(we O
were O
on O
Tuesday, O
it O
was O
quite O
spacious). O

Loved O
the O
local O
beer B-TARGET
right O
away))) O

Tried O
almost O
everything! O

Raspberry B-TARGET
"Aptekarskoe" I-TARGET
- O
very O
original! O

Service B-TARGET
was O
great! O
Everything O
on O
time, O
drinks O
- O
almost O
instantly! O
Nice O
girl B-TARGET
Anna O
told O
us O
everything O
and O
gave O
good O
advice O
on O
the O
menu, O
clearly O
and O
quickly. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
talking O
to O
her, O
thank O
you! O

The O
salads B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
the O
pork B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
feta I-TARGET
cheese, I-TARGET
pistachios I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mushroom I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
a O
delight!!! O

Pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood I-TARGET
in O
parchment O
- O
very O
original, O
gorgeous O
tomato B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
subtle O
flavor, O
sprigs O
of O
thyme B-TARGET
- O
very O
spicy! O

I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
original O
dishes B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
and O
you O
should O
definitely O
go O
to O
Quay B-TARGET
for O
a O
fresh O
culinary O
experience! O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
there O
again O
and O
will O
definitely O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
our O
friends! O

Yes, O
it's O
something, O
I O
can't O
even O
tell O
you O
how, O
but O
I'll O
try. O

I O
went O
into O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
, O
fairy O
tale O
! O
fairy O
tale O
! O

They O
greeted O
me O
with O
a O
smile. O

Very O
nice. O

They O
showed O
me O
a O
free O
table O
for O
two, O
and O
I O
was O
there. O

It's O
okay, O
I O
like O
to O
go O
alone. O

Nice O
girl B-TARGET
brought O
the O
menu. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
good, O
modest. O

I O
was O
sitting O
and O
wondering O
what O
to O
choose O
on O
such O
an O
empty O
stomach. O

Well, O
here O
it O
is: O
beef O
salad O
(290R), O
meat O
soup O
(210R), O
rack O
of O
lamb O
(680R). O

I O
wanted O
to O
have O
some O
juice O
but O
the O
girl O
advised O
me O
to O
have O
a O
natural O
morsel O
and O
I O
agreed. O

M-m, O
what O
a O
great O
salad! B-TARGET

Such O
a O
salad O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
tasted. O

And O
the O
soup B-TARGET
is O
even O
better. O

Very O
unusual. O

I'll B-TARGET
have O
the O
rack O
of O
lamb, O
I'll O
have O
it O
again. O

Until O
I'm O
bursting, O
I O
think O
one O
portion O
will O
be O
enough. O

Yes, O
thank O
you O
very O
much, O
chef. O

Way O
to O
go! O

It O
was O
delicious! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
everything O
was O
tasteful. O

The O
color, B-TARGET
the O
range, B-TARGET
the O
chairs B-TARGET
- O
everything O
is O
beautiful O
and O
comfortable. O

As O
in O
the O
kingdom. O

You'd O
better O
come O
here O
with O
someone O
you O
love O
to O
have O
dinner. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
good. O

There O
are O
a O
few O
downsides, O
but O
I O
think O
they O
will O
get O
over O
themselves. O

At O
8, O
but O
I'll O
give O
it O
a O
9. O

Because O
you O
can O
see O
that O
people O
are O
striving O
for O
the O
best. O

I O
will O
definitely O
come O
again. O

We O
had O
a O
birthday O
party O
at O
this O
"restaurant" O
three O
days O
ago. O

Today O
I O
decided O
to O
read O
reviews O
of O
this O
place, B-TARGET
because O
the O
evening O
was O
just O
ruined. O

I O
got O
the O
impression O
that O
we O
were O
somewhere O
else. O

Yes, O
nice O
interior, B-TARGET
good O
food... B-TARGET
But O
the O
rest O
was O
just O
awful. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
the O
food O
is O
not O
bad... O
But O
the O
rest O
was O
just O
awful. O

For O
all O
the O
restaurant O
worked O
one O
waitress, B-TARGET
which O
in O
itself O
is O
strange. O

If O
it O
simply O
could O
not O
cope O
with O
an O
abundance O
of O
orders, O
still O
somehow O
excusable, O
but O
she O
not O
very O
much O
and O
tried. O

For O
example, O
the O
wine O
we O
were O
brought O
20 O
minutes, O
we O
went O
out O
to O
smoke O
outside, O
where O
there O
are O
chairs O
and O
a O
table O
for O
that, O
we O
asked O
her O
to O
bring O
an O
ashtray O
... O
She O
promised O
to O
bring O
us O
an O
ashtray, O
but O
she O
didn't O
do O
it O
until O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal. O

As O
an O
appetizer O
we O
ordered O
olives O
among O
other O
things O
and O
they O
were O
brought O
to O
us O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening. O
She O
forgot O
about O
one O
of O
the O
requests O
and O
apologized. O

A O
separate O
story O
- O
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
good O
singer O
with O
a O
good O
voice... O
But O
for O
such O
a O
small O
room B-TARGET
- O
it's O
just O
silent O
horror. O

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
talk O
not O
only O
to O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
table, O
but O
the O
neighbors O
on O
the O
right O
and O
left O
had O
to O
interrupt. O

I O
agree, O
there O
is O
no O
difference O
to O
taste O
and O
color, O
but O
I O
will O
not O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
again O
and O
I O
will O
warn O
all O
my O
friends. O

Excellent O
place B-TARGET
with O
great O
food. B-TARGET

I O
have O
read O
so O
many O
reviews, O
to O
be O
honest O
more O
than O
half O
of O
them O
were O
lies. O

Somebody O
wrote O
about O
salads O
from O
the O
fridge O
and O
not O
tasty O
pita O
bread. O

All O
not O
true. O

Salads B-TARGET
are O
fresh, O
ingredients O
are O
clearly O
not O
from O
the O
ribbon O
and O
refrigerator. O

The O
pita B-TARGET
was O
fresh O
and O
we O
ate O
it O
right O
away O
before O
we O
even O
had O
time O
to O
serve O
the O
salad. O

Somebody O
said O
that O
the O
meat O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
to O
be O
cooked. O

Yes, O
they O
didn't O
bring O
it O
in O
10 O
minutes O
but O
they O
say O
at O
once O
you O
should O
wait O
for O
40 O
minutes. O

The O
shashlik B-TARGET
is O
fresh, O
melts, O
no O
fat O
and O
no O
bones. O

They O
don't O
give O
you O
the O
same O
tools. B-TARGET

From O
minuses O
(for O
me O
it O
is O
not O
a O
minus), O
there O
is O
no O
separately O
a O
hall B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
smokers, I-TARGET
well O
and O
probably O
a O
little O
bit O
intrusive O
personnel B-TARGET
(though O
for O
me O
it O
is O
just O
right). O

Glasses O
are O
always O
full O
and O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
few O
minutes O
when O
they O
approach O
you O
(in O
many O
establishments O
this O
is O
the O
case). O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
ok, O
not O
huge O
but O
not O
small O
either. O

And O
most O
importantly O
- O
the O
prices. O

Cheap O
and O
very O
tasty. O

How O
much O
we O
ate O
and O
drank O
for O
six O
people, O
in O
other O
places O
would O
have O
been O
simply O
two O
or O
three O
times O
more O
expensive. O

We O
left O
satisfied O
and O
full. O

According O
to O
the O
reviews, O
this O
place O
was O
visited O
by O
people O
of O
at O
least O
deputy O
rank. O

So O
if O
you O
have O
money, O
you O
can O
go O
to O
other O
restaurants, O
and O
not O
to O
write O
nonsense O
about O
salads O
from O
the O
fridge. O

Near O
the O
House O
of O
Books, O
with O
windows O
on O
the O
embankment O
is O
a O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
tasty O
name O
"Appetite". O

Several O
rooms B-TARGET
are O
conveniently O
located, O
though O
the O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
located O
right O
at O
the O
entrance. O

The O
coziest O
sofas B-TARGET
are O
in O
the O
smoking B-TARGET
area. I-TARGET

Fashion O
is O
broadcast O
on O
large O
screens. O
nice, O
relaxed O
interior B-TARGET
for O
friendly O
gatherings. O

Until O
this O
weekend O
I O
liked O
it... O
"Everything O
is O
mixed O
up O
in O
the O
house..." O

Service B-TARGET
- O
bad. O

They O
met O
me, O
sat O
me O
down, O
gave O
me O
a O
menu O
- O
fine. O

Apparently O
the O
girl B-TARGET
was O
working O
if O
not O
the O
first O
day, O
then O
the O
second O
day O
for O
sure. O

Maybe O
she O
will O
learn O
- O
it O
will O
be O
better, O
it O
is O
always O
good O
to O
learn. O

But O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
had O
been O
served O
pasta O
for O
1.5 O
hours-it O
was O
barbaric. O

I O
almost O
died O
of O
hunger. O

Well O
I O
had O
time O
to O
eat O
soup. B-TARGET

Regarding O
the O
kitchen: O
Has O
the O
chef B-TARGET
changed? O
I O
didn't O
get O
it... O

My O
order O
was O
miso; O
I O
wanted O
soup O
with O
Norwegian O
salmon, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
in O
the O
restaurant O
there O
was O
no O
salmon, B-TARGET
as O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
told O
us O
after O
twenty O
minutes O
(another O
stone O
in O
her O
garden); O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushrooms, I-TARGET
cream, I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
paste I-TARGET
(I O
mostly O
had O
to O
eat O
tomato B-TARGET
paste). O

Disappointed O
me O
previously O
loved O
"Appetite" B-TARGET
=((. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
to O
Aptetit O
was O
a O
year O
ago. O

I O
was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
meeting, O
service O
and O
cuisine O
(I O
was O
happy O
with O
the O
democratic O
prices). O

So, O
relying O
on O
my O
positive O
impressions O
and O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
our O
location, O
I O
decided O
to O
sit O
there O
with O
my O
friends. O

There O
were O
four O
of O
us. O

We O
came O
in, O
were O
greeted, O
escorted, O
seated, O
brought O
the O
menu O
and.... O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
gone...for O
20 O
minutes O
(even O
though O
there O
weren't O
many O
customers O
in O
the O
restaurant). O

Called, O
came O
over, O
ordered O
pasta, O
freshly O
squeezed O
juice, O
drinks. O

In O
about O
15 O
minutes O
they O
brought O
the O
drinks. O

In O
another O
15 O
minutes O
the O
first O
portion O
of O
pasta O
came... O
The O
second O
and O
third O
were O
served O
in O
15 O
minutes O
more, O
and O
the O
last O
portion O
was O
brought O
when O
the O
rest O
of O
them O
were O
done O
already.... O

Next O
was O
an O
order O
for O
Caesar O
salad O
and O
an O
Americano... O

We O
were O
waiting O
for O
a O
long O
time... O
Patience O
at O
the O
limit... O
Bottom O
line O
- O
did O
not O
leave O
a O
tip O
(probably O
not O
quite O
right, O
the O
person O
worked, O
but... O
... O
I O
thanked O
him O
in O
words O
only). O

The O
beer B-TARGET
was O
delicious... O
But O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
not. O
We O
ordered O
a O
beer O
plate O
to O
go O
with O
beer O
and O
meat. O

The O
plate O
for O
beer O
came O
when O
they O
took O
two O
mugs O
of O
beer. O

If O
the O
institution O
calls O
itself O
a O
restaurant, O
then O
be O
kind O
at O
least O
bring O
the O
hot O
meal O
to O
all O
at O
the O
same O
time! O

A O
company O
of O
4 O
people, O
everyone O
received O
his O
portion O
after O
a O
long O
time, O
although O
some O
dishes O
were O
the O
same... O

Meat O
waited O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
they O
brought O
the O
side O
dish O
first O
and O
the O
meat O
40 O
minutes O
later. O

And O
when O
I O
asked O
why O
this O
was O
so, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
said: O
Well, O
I O
brought O
you O
a O
side O
dish O
and O
you O
ate O
it... O
here O
is O
your O
meat)))))))))) O

Good O
afternoon. O

Celebrated O
in O
this O
restaurant O
on O
March O
7, O
was O
a O
banquet O
for O
20 O
people. O

It O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
afraid O
to O
go O
to O
a O
new O
place, O
but O
since O
we O
live O
nearby, O
we O
decided O
to O
take O
the O
risk O
and O
we O
didn't O
regret O
it. O

We O
paid O
for O
everything O
in O
advance O
and O
we O
were O
helped O
to O
prepare O
the O
menu O
individually O
according O
to O
our O
needs O
and O
budget. O

Everything O
was O
ready O
by O
the O
time O
we O
came, O
the O
tables O
were O
laid O
and O
the O
food O
was O
brought O
out. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
portions B-TARGET
were O
big O
and O
we O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
it! O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
program, I-TARGET
including O
a O
beautiful O
girl O
who O
sang O
and O
a O
Georgian B-TARGET
dance I-TARGET
troupe. I-TARGET

The O
hall B-TARGET
was O
very O
large O
and O
light, O
except O
for O
us O
there O
were O
two O
more O
banquets, O
but O
due O
to O
the O
large O
space O
no O
one O
bothered. O

A O
huge O
plus O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
bring O
alcohol O
with O
itself. O

In O
general O
all O
remained O
very O
very O
happy, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
a O
wonderful O
holiday, O
we O
will O
necessarily O
come O
to O
you O
again!!!!!! O

Just O
happened O
to O
walk O
in O
with O
some O
friends. O

Made O
a O
reservation. O

We O
were O
sitting O
outside O
and O
there O
was O
a O
party O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O

Asked O
for O
a O
blanket. O

Passed O
15 O
minutes O
- O
no O
plaid, O
no O
waiter. B-TARGET

We O
went O
ourselves O
and O
took O
the O
plaid. O

Tea O
was O
brought O
about O
10 O
minutes O
after O
ordering. O

Then, O
20 O
minutes O
later, O
they O
brought O
one O
salad. O

It O
took O
another O
20 O
minutes O
to O
bring O
one O
hot O
meal O
(the O
order O
was O
made O
for O
6 O
people). O

And O
that O
was O
it O
for O
the O
whole O
evening O
(some O
of O
my O
friends O
were O
eating O
and O
some O
were O
just O
waiting) O
- O
in O
general, O
I O
got O
my O
meal O
1 O
hour O
40 O
minutes O
after O
the O
order O
(the O
vegetables O
cooked O
on O
coals O
could O
have O
been O
cooked O
faster) O
and O
after O
3 O
walks O
of O
my O
husband O
to O
the O
waiter. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
declared O
on O
the O
menu O
obviously O
do O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
actual O
size O
- O
you O
can O
not O
even O
feed O
a O
child O
with O
such O
a O
portion! O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
that O
to O
anybody! O

We O
celebrated O
the O
wedding O
of O
a O
friend. O

We O
came O
in O
the O
evening, O
it O
was O
raining O
and O
that O
was O
the O
only O
drawback O
of O
the O
evening). O

That O
immediately O
pleasantly O
surprised O
the O
waitresses!!!-All B-TARGET
as O
a O
selection O
of O
smiling O
completely O
sincere O
and O
friendly, O
not O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
receiving O
tips O
(besides O
what O
tips-the O
same O
banquet), O
meet, O
see O
you O
off, O
and O
throughout O
the O
holiday O
unobtrusively O
"as O
invisible" O
change O
dishes, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
when O
it O
was O
necessary, O
they O
immediately O
appeared). O

Thanks O
a O
lot, O
I O
haven't O
seen O
such O
service B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time! O

Menu O
could O
not O
look O
at, O
so O
I O
do O
not O
know O
the O
names, O
prices, O
too. O

I O
liked O
the O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimps I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
leaves, I-TARGET
eggplant O
rolls B-TARGET
(the O
filling B-TARGET
included O
walnuts, B-TARGET
but O
I O
didn't O
understand O
the O
rest))), O
cold B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
and O
smelt O
stuffed O
with O
rice B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
- O
a O
really O
nice O
and O
tasty O
dish. B-TARGET

The O
pork B-TARGET
was O
uncooked O
for O
some O
reason. O

I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
mention O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
especially O
outside O
- O
the O
swings, O
the O
arbours, O
the O
"funny" O
figures... O
In O
general O
the O
photos O
are O
very O
colourful). O

Already O
recommended O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
all O
friends. O

Not O
only O
the O
young O
people O
liked O
it, O
but O
also O
the O
older O
people. O

I O
have O
to O
mention O
that O
it O
was O
chosen O
by O
the O
parents O
of O
our O
groom, O
I O
think O
that O
review O
by O
Natalya O
A. O
is O
a O
review O
of O
our O
friend's O
mother, O
so O
do O
not O
be O
so O
skeptical, O
people O
have O
long O
chosen O
this O
place O
and O
wrote O
a O
frank O
review, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
not O
wordy, O
but O
honest O
and O
without O
pathos))) O

Yesterday O
I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
to O
have O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
in O
the O
evening. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
much O
luck O
with O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
I O
went O
to O
the O
hotel. O

We O
weren't O
offered O
to O
go O
up O
to O
the O
second O
floor, O
because O
they O
smoke O
there. O

As O
I O
understood, O
all O
the O
best O
places O
are O
always O
for O
smokers, O
unfortunately. O

On O
the O
first O
floor O
is O
an O
open O
kitchen, O
tiled O
and O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
tables O
- O
not O
very O
cozy, O
but O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting, O
at O
least O
something O
original O
for O
such O
a O
format. O

From O
meal O
on O
a O
tip O
from O
the O
previous O
review O
I O
have O
taken O
chicken O
kebab B-TARGET
(270 O
rubles) O
- O
without O
enthusiasm, O
too O
much O
dough B-TARGET
and O
somehow O
it O
was O
bland, O
French O
fries B-TARGET
to O
it O
liked O
it O
better O
than O
the O
shawarma. O

I O
also O
tried O
noodles B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimps I-TARGET
(360 O
rubles) O
and O
liked O
it. O

The O
portion B-TARGET
could O
be O
bigger, O
of O
course, O
but O
this O
is O
ideal) O

There O
was O
something O
strange O
and O
crispy O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
dish, O
I O
couldn't O
taste O
it, O
so O
I O
didn't O
understand O
what O
it O
was O
and O
why O
it O
was O
there). O

I O
drank O
milky O
oolong O
(180 O
rubles) O
about O
it O
there O
is O
nothing O
to O
say O
except O
that O
it O
was O
cooked O
about O
20-25 O
minutes, O
like O
mineral O
water. O

The O
food O
was O
brought O
and O
the O
drinks O
were O
not, O
had O
to O
politely O
remind O
and O
all O
appeared. O

For O
a O
quick O
snack O
and O
run O
away, O
it's O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
middle O
of O
nowhere O
if O
they're O
quicker). O

We O
had O
a O
celebration O
in O
March O
2014 O
at O
the O
Na O
Gorka O
restaurant. O

Communicated O
always O
with O
the O
manager B-TARGET
Ekaterina, O
who O
answered O
all O
our O
questions, O
in O
many O
ways O
went O
to O
our O
meeting, O
and O
everything O
that O
was O
agreed O
- O
was O
done. O

Thanks O
a O
lot O
to O
her! O

We O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Of O
the O
minuses: O
We O
had O
two O
meals O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
which O
were O
very O
tasty. O

At O
the O
banquet O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
simple O
and O
well O
made O
but O
not O
very O
memorable O
in O
our O
opinion O
and O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
many O
of O
our O
guests. O

The B-TARGET
main I-TARGET
course, I-TARGET
pork B-TARGET
shish I-TARGET
kebab I-TARGET
and O
salmon, B-TARGET
was O
very O
well O
done O
and O
everything O
was O
soft O
and O
juicy. O

The O
day O
after O
the O
party, O
we O
remembered O
that O
there O
was O
no O
fruit O
on O
the O
tables, O
although O
it O
was O
included O
in O
the O
contract O
and, O
accordingly, O
paid O
for. O

So, O
dear O
visitors, O
please O
make O
sure O
that O
everything O
you O
ordered O
was O
brought O
to O
you. O

During O
the O
banquet O
children O
can O
be O
fed O
from O
a O
special O
children's O
menu, O
but O
on O
that O
day O
the O
cooks B-TARGET
thought O
(according O
to O
the O
waiter) O
that O
the O
food O
ordered O
for O
children O
should O
be O
brought O
only O
to O
the O
main O
course O
of O
all O
the O
guests O
(and O
that's O
about O
two O
hours O
after O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
event). O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
kids O
are O
sitting O
hungry O
and O
looking O
around O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
- O
is O
that O
normal O
for O
them? O

After O
contacting O
the O
manager, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
cooked O
and O
served O
immediately. O

So, O
check O
with O
the O
waiters. O

I O
decided O
with O
the O
girls O
to O
go O
somewhere O
to O
relax. O
I O
found O
a O
cozy O
grand-café B-TARGET
21 I-TARGET
Versta I-TARGET
on O
the O
Internet. O

I O
called O
to O
order O
a O
table, O
a O
pleasant O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
Eugene O
answered, O
booked O
us O
a O
table, O
taking O
into O
account O
all O
our O
wishes, O
for O
which O
he O
says O
a O
huge O
THANK O
YOU O
!!!!!! O

Arrived O
at O
the O
cafe O
at O
the O
appointed O
time O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
pleasant O
young B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
and O
showed O
us O
to O
the O
table. O

Served O
us O
wonderful O
girl, B-TARGET
politely O
and O
patiently O
answered O
all O
our O
questions. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
great O
- O
a O
huge O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
cooks. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
top O
notch. O

I O
liked O
everything O
about O
this O
place: O
interior, B-TARGET
food, B-TARGET
personnel, B-TARGET
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
and O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

I O
will O
recommend O
it O
to O
my O
friends O
and O
definitely O
will O
come O
back O
here O
again. O

WELL O
DONE!!!!!!!! O

KEEP O
IT O
UP!!!!! O

P. O

S. O

A O
special O
THANK O
YOU O
for O

song B-TARGET

Impressions O
of O
the O
institution B-TARGET
has O
left O
not O
the O
best! O

What O
a O
pity..... O
new O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
city! O

Firstly, O
no O
one O
meets O
the O
guests O
and O
accompanies O
them O
to O
the O
table, O
not O
to O
mention O
that O
the O
room O
for O
smokers O
or O
non-smokers O
was O
not O
offered O
at O
all! O

A O
friend O
ordered O
a O
business O
lunch O
and O
I O
never O
saw O
the O
menu, O
because O
they O
just O
did O
not O
bring O
it!!! O

The O
order O
was O
received O
horribly, O
after O
the O
leaving O
waiter B-TARGET
we O
were O
finishing O
our O
order!!! O

I O
ordered O
tea, O
but O
even O
that O
was O
brought O
without O
jasmine!))) O

Bread O
was O
not O
offered, O
in O
fact O
nothing O
was O
offered!!! O

With O
this O
kind O
of O
service B-TARGET
this O
place O
is O
unlikely O
to O
have O
regular O
guests! O

Worse O
than O
that O
... O
the O
bill O
came O
out O
when O
we O
were O
eating, O
and O
we O
even O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
it, O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
institution O
does O
not O
like O
it O
when O
guests O
are O
late, O
so O
we O
had O
the O
impression O
that O
we O
had O
to O
go!) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
there O
are O
sofas, B-TARGET
though O
not O
very O
soft! O

Previous O
reviews O
in O
one O
way O
or O
another O
fully O
describe O
this O
institution, O
but O
separately O
it O
would O
be O
desirable O
to O
note: O
1. O

The O
wine O
was O
brought O
after O
almost O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting, O
after O
several O
polite O
reminders, O
not O
chilled O
and O
quite O
different O
from O
what O
was O
ordered O
("not O
found") O
- O
the O
food O
was O
waiting O
very O
long, O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
no O
matter O
what, O
were O
delicious, O
though O
the O
portions B-TARGET
could O
be O
larger O
(especially O
the O
garnish). B-TARGET
2. O

2. O
We O
went O
with O
coupons, O
in O
the O
end, O
for O
two O
people O
with O
2 O
bottles O
of O
table O
wine O
- O
only O
3000 O
rubles. O
3. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
sings O
really O
well. O

We O
celebrated O
a O
birthday O
with O
a O
group O
of O
eight O
people. O

In O
general O
and O
on O
the O
whole O
I O
liked O
it. O

As O
to O
the O
menu: B-TARGET
Price O
- O
above O
an O
average O
A O
small O
choice O
of O
salads B-TARGET
From O
the O
dishes O
of O
the O
companies O
tried: O
pickles, O
pockets O
with O
mushrooms O
and O
fish, O
fried O
camembert, O
shish O
kebab O
of O
pork, O
pork O
with O
mozzarella O
and O
mushrooms, O
eel. O

We O
liked O
everything O
- O
portions B-TARGET
are O
big. O

As O
far O
as O
service O
is O
concerned: O
Waitresses B-TARGET
are O
a O
bit O
slow. O

The O
dishes O
were O
served O
long O
and O
unevenly O
(half O
of O
the O
people O
were O
sitting O
with O
empty O
plates O
and O
the O
other O
half O
hadn't O
even O
received O
appetizers O
yet). O

The O
buns B-TARGET
took O
especially O
long O
to O
arrive O
(and O
they O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
delicious). O

We O
had O
to O
pay O
at O
the O
counter, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
never O
brought O
the O
bill. O

In O
principle O
the O
festival O
was O
a O
success O
and O
the O
shortcomings O
do O
not O
spoil O
the O
overall O
impression. O

We O
had O
a O
dinner O
at O
your O
place O
recently. O

We O
looked O
for O
a O
long O
time O
by O
car O
and O
decided O
at O
last. O

Met O
us O
tired O
but O
friendly O
girls O
and O
immediately O
accompanied O
us O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
views B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window O
- O
above O
all O
praise. O

Interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
memorable. O

In O
general. O

I O
remember O
only O
that O
the O
cutlery, O
glasses O
and O
spices O
are O
along O
the O
wall O
on O
a O
low O
step. O

And O
that O
children O
run O
by. O

They O
reach O
for O
these O
cutlery O
as O
for O
their O
favorite O
toys. O

It's O
okay, O
it's O
even O
funny, O
but O
I O
wiped O
my O
instruments O
with O
a O
napkin, O
just O
in O
case. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
seemed O
a O
little O
boring, O
but O
we O
quickly O
made O
up O
our O
minds. O

My O
friend O
had O
tomato O
soup O
and O
marble O
beef O
steak O
with O
fresh O
tomatoes O
and O
I O
had O
the O
same O
steak O
with O
grilled O
vegetables. O

What O
can O
I O
say... O

The O
meat B-TARGET
was O
cooked O
a O
little O
stronger O
than O
what O
I O
ordered O
but O
still O
tasty O
and O
tender. O

For O
dessert O
we O
had O
chocolate O
cupcakes O
with O
hot O
chocolate O
inside O
and O
ice O
cream. O

Here's O
what O
was O
really O
incredibly O
delicious. O

I O
recommend O
that O
everyone O
try O
them! O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
not O
impressed. O

Honestly. O

Ashtray O
was O
very O
rarely O
changed, O
dirty O
dishes O
were O
not O
noticed O
for O
about O
10 O
minutes, O
and O
this O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
ran O
past O
the O
table O
more O
than O
once O
or O
twice. O

But O
during O
the O
direct O
communication O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
nice O
and O
friendly, O
which O
smoothed O
the O
negative O
impression. O

All O
in O
all O
it O
was O
very O
nice. O

Did O
I O
like O
it? O

More O
like O
yes O
than O
no. O

Would O
I O
go O
back? O

More O
likely O
no O
than O
yes. O

Today O
we O
had O
a O
birthday O
party O
with O
a O
small O
group O
of O
six O
people. O

We O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
VIP O
hall. O

I O
liked O
the O
table B-TARGET
decorations I-TARGET
and O
the O
candlesticks B-TARGET
have O
created O
a O
cosy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
family O
celebrations. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
excellent: O
plates O
were O
taken O
away O
immediately O
and O
new O
dishes O
were O
brought O
quickly O
so O
that O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
wait O
for O
anything. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
also O
pleasantly O
surprising, O
especially O
the O
portion B-TARGET
size. O

Everything O
was O
fresh O
and O
very O
tasty. O

The O
only O
"but" O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
live O
music, O
with O
it O
our O
evening O
would O
have O
been O
even O
more O
pleasant. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
meal O
and O
rest O
for O
relatively O
small O
money. O

I O
won't O
think O
where O
to O
go O
next O
time O
to O
celebrate O
any O
festivities. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
recently O
and O
I O
agree O
with O
many O
that O
the O
main B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
rather O
small, O
but O
I O
liked O
that O
there O
was O
a O
small O
children's B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
where O
a O
babysitter O
was O
sitting O
while O
we O
were O
having O
dinner, O
plus O
there O
was O
a O
free O
children's B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
for O
children. O

Yes O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
playing O
louder O
but O
we O
liked O
that O
it O
was O
national O
and O
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

I O
was O
served O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
who O
always O
smiled O
and O
gave O
us O
good O
food B-TARGET
recommendations. I-TARGET

The O
food O
was O
really O
like O
the O
Greek O
version O
(I O
go O
to O
Greece O
almost O
every O
summer). O

Tasty O
kebab B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
choice O
of O
salads, B-TARGET
quite O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
alcohol. B-TARGET

Plus O
the O
price O
is O
not O
high O
enough O
for O
the O
center O
of O
the O
city. O

So O
I O
think O
more O
than O
once O
a O
family O
will O
go. O

Today O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
flattering O
things O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
it. O

The O
impressions O
are O
very O
good. O

We O
were O
welcomed O
and O
were O
shown O
the O
rooms O
and O
as O
a O
result O
we O
chose O
a O
table O
on O
the O
veranda. O

There O
were O
not O
many O
people O
there, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
very O
comfortable O
and O
predisposing O
to O
long O
bouts O
of O
sitting. O

There O
is O
a O
simple O
interior B-TARGET
but O
in O
a O
Georgian O
style O
and O
there O
is O
pleasant O
music. B-TARGET

There O
is O
no O
desire O
to O
leave O
quickly. O

We O
were O
very O
lucky O
to O
have O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
was O
very O
kind O
and O
responsive O
in O
serving O
us. O

He O
explained O
to O
us O
the O
details O
of O
the O
dishes O
and O
gave O
recommendations O
as O
for O
the O
choice O
of O
dishes. O

Our O
order O
was O
fulfilled O
very O
quickly, O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
more O
than O
15 O
minutes. O

What O
can O
we O
say O
about O
the O
cuisine O
... O
We O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
hot B-TARGET
dishes, O
especially O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
- O
tender O
and O
juicy. B-TARGET

There O
was O
not O
enough O
salmon B-TARGET
kebab I-TARGET
in O
the O
portion, O
and O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
vegetables. O

You O
won't O
be O
especially O
stuffed. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
was O
dressed O
with O
too O
spicy O
sauce. B-TARGET

Wine B-TARGET
was O
very O
expensive O
so O
we O
had O
to O
make O
do O
with O
beer O
and O
rather O
tasty O
homemade B-TARGET
morsel. I-TARGET

There O
is O
a O
very O
wide O
choice O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
so O
I O
think O
that O
next O
time O
we O
will O
try O
something O
else. O

Yesterday O
we O
visited O
your O
place O
on O
Komendantskom O
2 O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
and O
attention O
of O
staff B-TARGET
is O
beyond O
praise! O
(Special O
thanks O
to O
our O
waiter B-TARGET
Eugene.) O

For O
a O
long O
time O
we O
were O
regulars O
in O
another O
Italian O
restaurant, O
now O
our O
hearts O
(and O
stomachs)) O
belong O
to O
Capone B-TARGET
!!! O

It O
was O
a O
little O
risky O
for O
us O
to O
come O
to O
you O
for O
the O
first O
time O
yesterday, O
as O
we O
had O
dinner O
planned O
for O
my O
D.R. O

But O
we O
were O
absolutely O
delighted, O
and O
already O
this O
morning, O
calling O
with O
friends O
all O
strongly O
recommended O
to O
come O
to O
you!!! O

For O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
I O
treat O
my O
birthday O
more O
than O
calmly, O
limiting O
myself O
to O
a O
quiet O
family O
dinner. O

But O
yesterday O
... O
For O
the O
first O
time O
in O
many O
years O
came O
back O
in O
the O
holiday O
spirit, O
as O
from O
childhood! O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
that! O

We O
would O
also O
like O
to O
note O
the O
quality O
of O
live B-TARGET
music! I-TARGET

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised! O

And O
of O
course O
our O
compliments O
to O
the O
chef! B-TARGET

And O
the O
taste O
and O
design O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
worthy O
of O
the O
highest O
estimate!!! O

Definitely O
we O
will O
visit O
you O
for O
all O
occasions, O
and O
without O
them, O
and O
of O
course O
will O
recommend O
your O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
all O
our O
friends! O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
again O
for O
a O
wonderful O
evening! O

Yesterday O
we O
went O
to O
a O
friend's O
wedding O
and O
celebrated O
at O
the O
Valley O
Restaurant. O

The O
evening O
was O
super O
at O
all!!! O

The O
tables B-TARGET
were O
very O
beautifully O
decorated. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
... O

Very O
cozy O
and O
beautiful, O
and O
not O
usual. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
great, O
we O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
fun! O

And O
we O
liked O
the O
waiters' B-TARGET
service, I-TARGET
because O
they O
were O
not O
intrusive O
and O
not O
noticeable, O
but O
in O
spite O
of O
that O
the O
glasses O
were O
always O
full, O
and O
the O
dishes O
were O
cleaned O
up O
in O
time. O

Well O
done O
guys. O
:) O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O
I O
would O
love O
to O
go O
there O
again. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
great! O

I O
even O
went O
on O
the O
website O
and O
left O
my O
feedback. O
)) O

I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
with O
my O
friends O
here. O

Before O
that, O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
came O
and O
visited O
a O
few O
pleasant O
impressions. O

Welcoming O
staff, B-TARGET
good O
choice O
of O
beer, B-TARGET
fast O
execution B-TARGET
of O
the O
order. O

Also O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
beer B-TARGET
at O
the O
reasonable O
price O
and O
not O
bad O
taste O
pleased. O

I O
ordered O
the O
table O
in O
advance, O
on O
Monday. O

However, O
on O
Friday, O
when O
I O
came O
directly O
to O
celebrate O
and O
decided O
to O
order O
their O
beer, O
I O
was O
told O
that O
there O
was O
only O
one O
kind, O
and O
not O
a O
local O
beer. B-TARGET

I O
was O
upset, O
but O
not O
to O
cancel O
all O
the O
same, O
the O
more O
guests O
began O
to O
come O
up O
little O
by O
little.... O

Only O
in O
half O
an O
hour O
we O
were O
served O
the O
ordered O
beer. O

The O
next O
time O
I O
managed O
to O
call O
the B-TARGET
waitress, I-TARGET
when O
the O
glasses O
were O
already O
10 O
minutes O
empty... O

We O
decided O
to O
order O
a O
few O
more O
beers O
so O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
any O
longer. O

After O
a O
few O
minutes O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
brought O
1 O
glass O
and O
said O
there O
was O
no O
more O
beer!!!! B-TARGET

We O
didn't O
want O
to O
stay O
at O
this O
place B-TARGET
anymore. O

Thank O
god O
we O
have O
other O
places O
in O
town O
where O
the O
beer O
doesn't O
run O
out O
after O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
wait O
staff O
doesn't O
forget O
about O
your O
table O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

So O
the O
evening O
was O
saved, O
but O
the O
Globe B-TARGET
was O
left O
with O
a O
heavy O
unpleasant O
residue... O

I O
have O
been O
here O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
once O
so O
far. O

We O
came O
in O
the O
evening O
to O
listen O
to O
live O
music, O
relax O
and O
socialize. O

We O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

We O
were O
happy O
with O
everything. O

There O
is O
a O
cafe O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
and O
3 O
halls O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O

I O
can't O
really O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
food O
... O
I O
can't O
really O
evaluate O
it O
all O
at O
once O
but O
the O
food O
corresponded O
to O
my O
tastes O
and O
preferences O
(we O
ordered O
rolls B-TARGET
Philly, I-TARGET
Greek B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and O
beer). B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
varied O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
reasonable. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

There O
are O
tables B-TARGET
for O
every O
taste O
with O
sofas O
and O
a O
window O
in O
front O
of O
the O
stage. O

I O
had O
very O
good O
music B-TARGET
and O
the O
Egeiro O
Project O
was O
there O
that O
night, O
many O
thanks O
to O
them. O

P. O

S. O

A O
very O
cosy O
place B-TARGET
for O
an O
evening O
out. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
again. O
/> O

Absolutely O
wonderful O
spent O
the O
evening O
in O
the O
"Kitchen"! B-TARGET

Madly O
like O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
its O
exquisite O
simplicity O
- O
cozy O
and O
warm. O

Very O
pleased O
with O
the O
friendly O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Special O
thanks O
for O
the O
service B-TARGET
to O
our O
waitress B-TARGET
(sorry, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
the O
name) O
- O
she O
knew O
the O
menu O
perfectly, O
unobtrusively O
helped O
us O
to O
choose O
dishes. O

We O
ate O
everything O
we O
ordered O
with O
great O
pleasure! O

I O
liked O
a O
salad B-TARGET
"Pampelonne" I-TARGET
very O
much O
- O
spinach B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
blue I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
dressing B-TARGET
was O
"something O
with O
something"! O

I O
also O
found O
the O
cream B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
lentil I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chanterelle I-TARGET
soups I-TARGET
insanely O
delicious. O

I O
couldn't O
get O
down O
to O
dessert O
- O
I O
was O
so O
stuffed O
with O
salad B-TARGET
and O
soup B-TARGET
that O
I O
couldn't O
even O
try O
a O
bite. O

But O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
that O
my O
friends O
ordered O
looked O
very O
appetizing, O
and O
from O
their O
rapturous O
exclamations, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
their O
expectations O
were O
met.) O

So O
if O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
time O
in O
a O
cozy O
and O
friendly O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
have O
a O
delicious O
meal O
at O
the O
same O
time O
then O
Kuhnya B-TARGET
is O
the O
right O
place O
for O
you O
;) O

Had O
a O
friends O
recommendation O
to O
visit O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
impression O
was O
not O
the O
best. O

Was O
not O
a O
good O
impression. O
15 O
minutes O
waiting O
for O
the O
menu O
(though O
the O
crowds O
were O
not O
very O
large) O
and O
then O
another O
15 O
minutes O
to O
place O
an O
order, O
prices O
just O
above O
the O
average O
in O
the O
city O
but O
the O
quality O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
portions O
of O
salads B-TARGET
are O
small O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
is O
generally O
rubbery, O
during O
the O
entire O
time O
there O
was O
no O
ashtray O
was O
changed O
once. O

A O
place O
to O
spend O
the O
evening. O

The B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
quite O
large, O
there O
is O
a O
non-smoking B-TARGET
area I-TARGET
and O
children's B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
(and O
it O
is O
behind O
the O
glass O
next O
to O
the O
non-smoking O
area, O
very O
convenient O
to O
watch O
the O
kids). O

There O
are O
tables O
for O
two O
with O
funny B-TARGET
wicker I-TARGET
hammocks I-TARGET
instead O
of O
chairs O
near O
the O
window. O

There's O
a O
small O
dance B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
next O
to O
the O
fotan O
(they O
play O
a O
good O
house B-TARGET
there O
by O
the O
way), O
lots O
of O
plasma B-TARGET
screens, I-TARGET
embroidered O
sofas B-TARGET
and O
you O
can O
see O
that O
people O
have O
tried O
with O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
finish I-TARGET
is O
used O
all O
inexpensive, O
but O
the O
space B-TARGET
itself O
looks O
comfortable O
and O
festive. O

There O
is O
a O
checkroom B-TARGET
too. O

The B-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
was O
not O
particularly O
impressive, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small O
but O
ok O
for O
a O
bar, O
although O
the O
prices O
seemed O
a O
bit O
steep. O

We O
were O
disappointed O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
mussels B-TARGET
and O
some O
dried O
dried O
pastries B-TARGET
which O
took O
rather O
a O
long O
time O
to O
cook. O

A O
friend O
ordered O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
said O
it O
was O
tasty. O

A O
small O
selection O
of O
beers B-TARGET
(but O
excellent O
beer), B-TARGET
in O
general O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
choice O
of O
alcohol B-TARGET
for O
the O
bar O
is O
not O
much. O

Cocktails B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice O
and O
the O
photos O
are O
on O
the O
menu, O
you O
can O
immediately O
see O
what O
you're O
ordering, O
very O
convenient. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
nice O
because O
even O
though O
the O
place O
was O
pretty O
crowded O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
didn't O
make O
us O
wait O
and O
periodically O
showed O
up O
to O
get O
the O
dishes O
and O
ask O
if O
we O
needed O
anything. O

Overall, O
I O
liked O
it O
and O
ticked O
it O
off. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
you O
for O
the O
unexpectedly O
pleasant O
atmosphere O
and O
staff B-TARGET
at O
your O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
came O
in O
a O
company O
on O
14.02, O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
on O
the O
phone O
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
polite, O
when O
we O
went O
into O
the O
restaurant O
we O
were O
immediately O
met O
and O
taken O
to O
the O
desired O
table O
on O
the O
terrace O
overlooking O
the O
pier, O
waitress B-TARGET
- O
good O
for O
her, O
she O
did O
not O
take O
long O
to O
wait O
and O
was O
well-versed O
in O
the O
menu, O
helped O
us O
choose O
the O
desired O
dishes. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
there O
was O
jazz O
night, O
music B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice O
too! O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
again, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
a O
permanent O
guest O
card!) O

We O
came O
to O
the O
restaurant O
on O
our O
day O
off O
by O
chance. O

It O
was O
advised O
by O
my O
sister O
who O
often O
comes O
there. O

It's B-TARGET
quite O
cosy O
and O
has O
a O
nice O
homely O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

There O
weren't O
many O
people, O
so O
we O
got O
a O
table O
at O
the O
window O
overlooking O
the O
Grand O
Avenue. O

It's O
not O
bad. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
tasty O
but O
the O
portions B-TARGET
weren't O
very O
big. O

There O
were O
four O
of O
us O
and O
we O
all O
ordered O
pasta. O

Everyone O
had O
a O
pretty O
decent O
meal. O

The O
salads B-TARGET
in O
general O
were O
delicious. O

I O
had O
the O
mushroom O
pasta. O

Mmmm. O

Delicious. O

The O
only O
drawback O
was O
that O
it O
took O
a O
very O
long O
time O
to O
be O
served. O

In O
response O
to O
our O
comments, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
said O
that O
they O
had O
some O
problems O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

We O
didn't O
want O
to O
find O
out O
what O
the O
problem O
was, O
but O
the O
mood O
was O
spoiled. O

The O
prices O
are O
average. O

Yes, O
and O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
they O
leave O
a O
tip O
of O
the O
amount O
to O
themselves. O

And O
so O
not O
bad. O

You O
can O
also O
buy O
olive O
oil O
at O
home. O

Very O
tasty. O

Have O
a O
great O
time. O

So, O
I O
will O
start O
with O
the O
end. O

LOVED O
EVERYTHING!!! O

I O
guess O
I'm O
a O
conservative, O
because O
I O
like O
this O
kind O
of O
place: O
a O
good O
interior, B-TARGET
soft O
music, B-TARGET
quiet O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
polite O
and O
courteous O
staff. B-TARGET

I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
near O
my O
home. O

I've O
been O
choosing O
a O
place O
for O
a O
long O
time.... O

A O
walk O
to O
the O
place, O
to O
accommodate O
the O
child O
in O
the O
nursery, O
and O
the O
reviews O
was O
more O
or O
less. O

The O
choice O
fell O
on O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
room O
was O
half O
empty, O
she B-TARGET
herself O
offered O
a O
place O
in O
the O
corner O
for O
us O
(me, O
my O
wife O
and O
my O
son O
of O
6). O

The O
food B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
was O
satisfactory O
to O
all O
without O
exception. O

My O
wife O
loved O
the O
vegetables, B-TARGET
the O
salad B-TARGET
"Caesar" I-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
- O
no O
questions O
asked, O
etc. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
kept O
an O
eye O
on O
the O
table O
and O
changed O
the O
ashtray O
and O
added O
wine O
on O
time. O

Service B-TARGET
as O
it O
should O
be O
- O
classic O
style. O

Here O
I O
sat O
and O
thought.... O

Well O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
minuses O
to O
find! O

Everything O
is O
great. O

We O
were O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
definitely O
not O
the O
last! O

Celebrated O
in O
the O
banquet O
hall O
son's O
wedding O
in O
July O
2013. O

The O
hall B-TARGET
is O
great. O

But... O

We O
chose O
an O
average O
menu B-TARGET
in O
the O
price O
range. O

When O
we O
got O
there, O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
small O
number O
of O
appetizers. B-TARGET

I O
thought O
there O
should O
be O
more. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
was O
astonished O
by O
the O
dried O
cheese. B-TARGET

The O
fruit B-TARGET
was O
on O
its O
last O
legs. O

When O
I O
tried O
the O
salads B-TARGET
- O
I O
was O
horrified. O

The O
quality O
was O
of O
a O
diner, O
not O
a O
banquet O
hall. O

Before O
ordering O
a O
banquet O
I O
ordered O
some O
food O
in O
the O
cafe O
on O
the O
first O
floor. O

I O
liked O
the O
food. B-TARGET

But O
I O
had O
the O
impression O
that O
for O
the O
banquet O
someone O
else O
was O
cooking. O

I O
didn't O
like O
the O
hot B-TARGET
dishes O
either. O

We O
had O
our O
own O
cake. O

The O
wedding, O
of O
course, O
was O
fun, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
did O
not O
decorate O
it. O

When O
the O
young O
people O
left O
and O
the O
guests O
left, O
I O
asked O
them O
to O
pack O
the O
rest O
for O
us. O

The O
receptionist O
at O
checkout O
said O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
packed O
and O
collected, O
including O
alcohol O
and O
juices. O

To O
my O
surprise, O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
told O
me O
that O
I O
can O
collect O
everything O
from O
the O
tables O
myself, O
they O
will O
give O
me O
the O
containers O
for O
a O
fee. O

After O
THIRTY O
minutes O
of O
bickering, O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
them O
to O
put O
some O
things O
together. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
alcohol, O
water, O
and O
juices O
were O
collected O
by O
ourselves. O

My O
second O
son O
is O
getting O
married O
this O
year. O

When O
he O
said O
that O
the O
hall O
was O
already O
taken O
on O
the O
right O
date O
- O
I O
was O
glad. O

My O
boyfriend O
once O
booked O
a O
table O
for O
March O
8. O

He O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
too. O

But O
the O
service B-TARGET
.... O
Whether O
the O
service O
staff O
wanted O
to O
begin O
to O
celebrate O
March O
8 O
quickly O
(we O
got O
there O
about O
21.30, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance O
said O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
open O
until O
23.00, O
although O
in O
advance, O
when O
booking O
a O
table, O
NO O
ONE O
WARNED O
THAT O
the O
restaurant O
will O
work O
until O
23.00). O

The O
order O
was O
brought O
fairly O
quickly, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
began O
to O
eat, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
rudely O
asked O
us O
to O
move O
to O
another O
table. O

I, O
of O
course, O
refused. O

The O
mood O
was O
not O
spoiled O
(just O
was O
unpleasant), O
but O
we O
have O
not O
left O
a O
tip. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant O
is O
yours O
and O
I O
will O
not O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone. O

Good O
day! O

We O
went O
to O
the O
cafe O
yesterday O
with O
friends! O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much! O

Thanks O
a O
lot O
to O
the O
cooks, B-TARGET
very O
tasty O
dishes B-TARGET
!!!!!. O

I O
ordered O
Beefsteaks, B-TARGET
it O
was O
so O
delicious!) O

They O
are O
fast O
and O
qualitative, O
you O
can O
feel O
at O
once O
that O
the O
masters O
work O
there! O

Thanks O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
good O
service, B-TARGET
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
waiters! B-TARGET

We O
hope O
to O
visit O
this O
wonderful, O
comfortable O
place B-TARGET
with O
excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
many O
more O
times. O

I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
come O
in O
at O
first-it O
was O
too O
bright O
and O
flashy! O

At O
the O
entrance O
you O
enter O
into O
a O
small O
cafe-room. O

At O
first O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
cafe, O
but O
going O
up O
to O
the O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
I O
was O
shocked O
by O
the O
amount O
of O
people! O

Just O
an O
unreal O
amount O
of O
people! O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
long O
time O
on O
the O
condition O
that O
you O
call O
her O
yourself, O
and O
not O
just O
once! O

We O
ordered O
chicken O
tobacco, O
Greek O
salad O
and O
beer! O

I O
have O
a O
principle O
- O
in O
any O
new O
place O
for O
me O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
order O
a O
Greek O
salad: O
liked O
it, O
you O
can O
have O
this O
place O
in O
mind, O
or O
vice O
versa. O

Beer O
was O
brought O
quickly.While O
drinking O
noticed O
that O
the O
glass O
at O
the O
bottom O
dirty, O
as O
from O
kefir.I O
thought: O
"well, O
here O
we O
go!!!" O
but O
then O
I O
looked O
closely O
and O
realized O
that O
this O
is O
such O
a O
glass O
with O
an O
indicator O
... O
how O
to O
say O
it O
... O
degree, O
which O
is O
below O
0 O
))))) O

The O
salad O
was O
brought O
quickly-very O
pleased! O

Thought O
it O
would O
be O
worse. O

Vegetables O
fresh O
chicken O
waited O
long...Probably O
half O
an O
hour. O

But O
it O
was O
worth O
it..well O
cooked, O
seasoning B-TARGET
in O
moderation. O

Garlic B-TARGET
is O
just O
right. O

The O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
included, O
but O
I O
didn't O
like O
it...maybe O
because O
of O
the O
bread O
since O
I O
dipped O
it O
in O
the O
sauce... O

In O
general, O
the O
impressions O
are O
very O
nice O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
simple O
girl, B-TARGET
which O
of O
course O
can O
not O
be O
said O
about O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
... O
but O
God O
with O
them! O

She O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
her O
birthday O
there. O

Were O
on O
February O
1. O

It O
was O
my O
second O
time O
and O
my O
friend's O
first. O

We O
came O
not O
late, O
at O
seven O
o'clock. O

There O
were O
very O
few O
people O
there. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
please O
the O
restaurant O
tastes O
of O
my O
girlfriend. O

At O
the O
entrance O
the O
girls B-TARGET
asked O
about O
our O
preferences O
and O
took O
us O
to O
the O
second O
floor. O

Beforehand O
we O
were O
told O
about O
all O
the O
niceties O
of O
the O
place. O

We O
were O
offered O
to O
choose O
a O
table. O

Soft O
sofas B-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
pillows. B-TARGET

Quite O
pleasant O
soft O
music B-TARGET
and O
a O
light O
twilight. B-TARGET

For O
some O
reason O
we O
were O
served O
by O
two O
waiters. O

The O
second O
waiter O
was O
pleasant O
and O
courteous, O
and O
as O
it O
turned O
out O
he O
knew O
the O
components O
of O
all O
the O
dishes. O

He O
also O
helped O
my O
companion O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
wine, B-TARGET
and O
me O
with O
a O
cocktail B-TARGET
drink, I-TARGET
and O
there O
are O
of O
all O
kinds, O
as O
they O
say. O

The O
beef B-TARGET
medallions I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
were O
wonderful. O

I've O
moved O
away O
from O
fish O
lately O
and O
I'm O
glad O
when O
they O
serve O
well-cooked O
meat. B-TARGET

The O
order O
was O
brought O
fairly O
quickly. O

There O
were O
two O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant O
all O
the O
time, O
so O
that O
it O
took O
them O
just O
a O
minute O
to O
answer O
the O
phone. O

We O
spent O
over O
two O
hours O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
greeted O
with O
smiles O
and O
an O
offer O
to O
come O
again, O
but O
it O
was O
on O
duty! O

Overall O
a O
great O
dining B-TARGET
experience. O

I O
hope O
that O
we O
will O
have O
a O
bigger O
company! O

In O
April O
I O
celebrated O
my O
birthday O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

Everyone O
was O
very O
pleased. O

We O
were O
lucky O
- O
at O
this O
time O
there O
were O
not O
many O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
so O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
(although O
I O
think O
the O
receptionist B-TARGET
served O
us) O
was O
only O
for O
us. O

I O
liked O
the O
service B-TARGET
- O
professional, O
unobtrusive O
and O
friendly. O

They O
helped O
us O
with O
the O
choice O
and O
set O
the O
table O
with O
cold O
appetizers. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
tasty! O

Shashlik B-TARGET
was O
really O
excellent. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cosy. O

The O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
perfect! O

In O
the O
first O
months O
after O
its O
opening O
we O
couldn't O
get O
excited O
about O
such O
a O
great O
place. B-TARGET

It O
was O
a O
great O
place O
to O
meet O
friends O
and O
just O
as O
a O
couple O
with O
a O
friend. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
was O
at O
a O
high O
level. O

Used O
to O
go O
there O
about O
three O
times O
a O
week. O

Now O
it O
all O
seems O
to O
have O
gone O
wrong. O

There O
are O
always O
an O
awful O
lot O
of O
people O
there. O

Service B-TARGET
has O
dropped O
dramatically. O

The O
last O
time O
we O
didn't O
even O
get O
a O
table O
wiped O
after O
previous O
visitors. O

Very O
often O
there O
is O
no O
what O
is O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
(although O
this O
was O
not O
before) O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
deteriorated O
in O
my O
opinion. O

But O
the O
prices O
remained O
at O
the O
same O
level. O

In O
general, O
not O
happy O
this O
place. B-TARGET

I O
was O
in O
this O
place O
on O
10.09.2008. O
My O
husband O
and O
I O
came O
there O
after O
work O
and O
found O
it O
hardly, O
the O
name O
was O
good O
but O
it O
was O
written O
so O
artistically O
that O
I O
couldn't O
understand O
it.) O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
very O
nice O
and O
small O
comfortable O
- O
but O
it's O
more O
like O
a O
cafe O
than O
a O
restaurant. O

Two O
floors B-TARGET
- O
the O
second O
is O
much O
cozier)) O
we O
were O
immediately O
met, O
undressed, O
carried O
out O
and O
posted)) O

Many O
thanks O
to O
the O
checkroom B-TARGET
attendant-waiter-barman I-TARGET
in O
one O
person, O
nice O
and O
friendly O
African-American.) B-TARGET

The O
food O
was O
cooked O
fast O
food O
in O
5-10 O
minutes O
and O
especially O
delicious O
baked O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
Philadelphia B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
why O
there O
were O
5 O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
6 O
and O
7))) O

The O
price O
tag O
is O
quite O
restaurant-like O
in O
my O
opinion, O
but O
maybe O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
rolls B-TARGET
are O
quite O
large. O

In O
general O
I O
liked O
it O
- O
a O
very O
large O
selection O
of O
sushi, B-TARGET
rolls, B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
soups B-TARGET
and O
other O
hot B-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

But O
I O
will O
not O
go O
here O
again, O
because O
there O
are O
places O
where O
sushi O
is O
prepared O
better O
and O
more O
thorough. O

I O
just O
came O
from O
this O
place. O

I O
want O
to O
tell, O
so O
that O
others O
will O
have O
to O
take O
note.... O

The B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
is O
cozy, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting O
and O
well O
made O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good. O

We O
came, O
at O
first O
everything O
was O
good, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
brought O
the O
menu O
at O
once, O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
came O
to O
take O
the O
order, O
in O
5 O
minutes O
brought O
beer, O
in O
5 O
minutes O
brought O
another O
snacks O
and O
that O
was O
the O
end O
of O
all O
pleasant O
things. O

Then O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
seemed O
to O
have O
disappeared. O
It O
was O
impossible O
to O
reach O
her O
to O
order O
something O
more O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
very O
long. O

And O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
instead O
of O
politely O
sorted O
out, O
acted O
rude, O
as O
a O
result, O
brought O
a O
new O
bill, O
with O
the O
words, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
... O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
what O
you O
ordered, O
but O
have O
it O
your O
way O
... O
in O
short, O
spoiled O
the O
mood O
.... O
so O
I O
will O
come O
to O
this O
institution B-TARGET
is O
not O
soon O
again O

To O
be O
honest, O
passing O
by O
recently O
on O
Gorokhovaya O
more O
than O
once O
I O
noticed O
a O
new O
restaurant, O
judging O
by O
the O
name O
of O
Georgian O
cuisine. O

Every O
time O
I O
was O
going O
to O
go O
in, O
but O
somehow O
did O
not O
succeed.... O

And O
finally O
I O
planned O
my O
visit O
to O
Saperavi O
on O
purpose O
for O
the O
weekend. O

Interior: B-TARGET
Even O
from O
the O
street O
restaurant O
attracts O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
dim B-TARGET
light. I-TARGET

Once O
inside, O
the O
impression O
is O
even O
better. O

Brick O
walls, O
solid O
furniture, B-TARGET
modern O
interior. B-TARGET

All O
as O
I O
like. O

Ten O
for O
my O
taste. O

Service: B-TARGET
welcomed O
friendly, O
hung O
my O
clothes O
in O
the O
closet O
and O
accompanied O
me O
to O
the O
table. O

All O
good.... O

Served O
quickly O
and O
efficiently, O
recommending O
this O
or O
that O
dish. O

Asked O
if O
they O
liked O
it. O

Overall, O
pleasant O
and O
unobtrusive. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
are O
very O
helpful O
and O
I O
hope O
they O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
so. O

Cuisine: O
Khachapuri B-TARGET
- O
a O
lot O
of O
cheese, B-TARGET
soft O
dough... B-TARGET
Excellent. O

Salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
- O
large O
portion B-TARGET
and O
unusual O
dressing. B-TARGET

Salad B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Chef I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
- O
nothing O
too O
fancy, O
but O
tasty. O

Tiramisu B-TARGET
was O
really O
wonderful. O

Very O
soft O
cream B-TARGET
and O
good O
spread. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

It's O
good O
that O
restaurants B-TARGET
with O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
service B-TARGET
are O
opening, O
no O
matter O
what. O

Will O
I O
go O
back? O
- O
Yes, O
definitely, O
there's O
still O
so O
much O
on O
the O
menu O
that O
hasn't O
been O
tried O
out O
yet). O

I O
was O
not O
deceived O
by O
my O
friends! O

As O
the O
saying O
goes: O
"The O
tastiest O
sushi B-TARGET
in O
town!" O
and O
so O
it O
turned O
out. O

Location O
and O
interior: O
The O
restaurant O
is O
located O
in O
a O
residential B-TARGET
area, I-TARGET
I O
would O
not O
have O
gone O
there O
on O
my O
own, O
but O
there O
was O
on O
the O
way. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
neat, O
quiet O
and O
comfortable. O

Cuisine: B-TARGET
Sushi B-TARGET
and O
fresh O
fish, B-TARGET
properly O
cooked O
rice, B-TARGET
both O
baked O
and O
classic B-TARGET
sushi I-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
wonderfully O
good. O

All O
portions B-TARGET
of O
an O
impressive O
size:) O

Well, O
very O
tasty. O

And O
give O
a O
tasty O
dumpling B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cherries, I-TARGET
which O
is O
also O
not O
bad. O

Service: B-TARGET
Quick, O
to O
the O
point, O
no O
mistakes. O

Prices O
are O
average, O
sushi O
from O
55 O
rubles, O
rolls B-TARGET
up O
to O
600, O
drinks B-TARGET
are O
not O
expensive. O

The O
overall O
impression O
is O
pleasant. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
of O
Leninsky O
Prospekt, O
an O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
for O
fans O
of O
Japanese O
cuisine. O

I O
recommend O
it O
as O
a O
restaurant O
for O
lunch O
and O
dinner. O

The O
audience O
is O
different, O
couples O
and O
guys O
who O
came O
to O
have O
lunch O
"in O
the O
neighborhood", O
girls-girlfriends O
and O
mothers O
with O
children. O

For O
romantic O
dates, O
I'm O
not O
sure. O

But O
to O
come O
in O
and O
have O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
just O
for O
no O
reason-yes, O
I O
liked O
it. O
-1 O
point O
for O
the O
coffee, B-TARGET
it's O
not O
tasty. O

The O
overall O
impression O
is O
pleasant. O

Thank O
you O
for O
a O
delicious O
lunch! O

Hello O
everyone! O

We O
are O
from O
Moscow, O
we O
visited O
Peter O
and O
your O
wonderful O
restaurant B-TARGET
at O
the O
weekend! O

I O
liked O
everything: O
an O
unusual O
interior B-TARGET
and O
good O
waitress B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
with O
a O
recommendation O
of O
dishes, O
beautiful O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window, O
and O
most O
importantly, O
very O
good O
cuisine! B-TARGET

The O
price O
corresponds O
to O
the O
quality, O
and O
everything O
is O
very O
delicious, O
which O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
rare O
in O
St. O
Petersburg, O
where O
there O
are O
few O
really O
good O
restaurants. O
"BELLINI" B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
them! O

Next O
time O
we O
are O
in O
St. O
Petersburg O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
to O
your O
place, O
thank O
you! O

On O
Friday O
the O
8th O
with O
my O
friends O
we O
walked O
by O
the O
restaurant O
and O
saw O
a O
big O
sign O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
Olympic O
Games. O

We O
were O
impressed O
by O
the O
simplicity O
of O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
(thank O
you O
very O
much O
chef), O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
snacks B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
beer. I-TARGET

Especially O
liked O
the O
"peppers B-TARGET
galapena" I-TARGET
(I O
think O
that O
was O
the O
name O
of O
this O
incomparable O
dish), O
reasonable O
prices, O
large O
portions. B-TARGET

Few O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
so O
good O
and O
so O
inexpensive!!!! O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

The O
girl B-TARGET
who O
served O
us, O
with O
a O
rare O
name O
Antonina, O
well O
versed O
in O
the O
food O
at O
the O
restaurant O
and O
skillfully O
recommended O
us O
different O
appetizers. O

And O
what O
a O
beer B-TARGET
!!! O

There O
are O
about O
10 O
varieties O
for O
every O
taste. O

The O
bartender B-TARGET
became O
just O
a O
friend O
to O
us. O

To O
any O
question O
about O
beer, O
he O
skillfully O
chose O
a O
beer B-TARGET
for O
each O
of O
us O
to O
taste. O

Everything O
was O
great O
about O
this O
beer B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
!!!! O

Everyone O
Grossenstrasse B-TARGET
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

Until O
recently, O
regularly O
visited O
this O
establishment O
with O
my O
colleagues. O

But O
lately O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
worsened: O
then O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
so O
salty O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
eat O
it, O
or O
a O
patty O
to O
the O
first O
course O
was O
served O
after O
the O
first O
course O
was O
eaten. O

And O
today O
we O
ordered O
kulesh. O

A O
dish O
from O
an O
ordinary O
menu, O
without O
any O
frills. O

After O
20 O
minutes O
of O
waiting, O
we O
asked O
waitress B-TARGET
Lyubov O
whether O
the O
soup O
would O
be O
served O
soon. O

The O
answer O
was O
in O
3-5 O
minutes. O

Another O
10 O
minutes O
passed. O

We O
declined O
the O
soup O
and O
asked O
for O
the O
book O
of O
reviews. O

The O
book O
was O
brought O
fairly O
quickly, O
and O
another O
5 O
minutes O
later O
- O
the O
soup, O
which O
eating O
no O
longer O
felt O
like O
it. O

Asked O
to O
come O
to O
us O
or O
the O
manager B-TARGET
or O
another O
administrator. B-TARGET

Five O
minutes O
later O
came O
the O
girl B-TARGET
who O
did O
not O
introduce O
herself O
and O
asked O
about O
our O
claims. O

To O
our O
remark O
that O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
about O
half O
an O
hour O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
soup, O
there O
was O
no O
apology, O
but O
a O
phrase O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
customers. O

For O
a O
restaurant O
of O
such O
level O
it O
is O
unacceptable O
that O
the O
slovenliness O
and O
inactivity O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
would O
affect O
the O
general O
impression O
of O
the O
place. B-TARGET

Of O
all O
the O
Chinese O
restaurants O
I O
have O
visited, O
Tan B-TARGET
Zhen I-TARGET
on O
Pea O
is O
my O
favourite. O

This O
is O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
a O
good, O
tasty O
and O
simple O
meal. O

Here O
you O
will O
not O
have O
an O
expensive, O
luxurious O
interior O
and O
an O
exquisite O
menu. O

But O
you O
will O
get O
excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
fast, O
high-quality O
service. B-TARGET

From O
year O
to O
year, O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
not O
getting O
worse, O
which O
can O
not O
help O
but O
make O
you O
happy. O

Despite O
the O
insane O
popularity, O
the O
owners O
hold O
the O
brand O
and O
do O
not O
allow O
themselves O
to O
save O
on O
food B-TARGET
quality. O

Moreover, O
even O
when O
the O
room O
is O
full O
(and O
it O
happens O
in O
99.9% O
of O
cases), O
you O
will O
not O
wait O
for O
the O
menu O
or O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
longer O
than O
2 O
minutes. O

A O
simple O
example: O
On O
February O
14, O
in O
a O
full O
house, O
it O
took O
15 O
minutes O
from O
the O
time O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table O
to O
the O
time O
the O
first O
course O
was O
brought O
out O
to O
us. O

And O
it O
was O
delicious. O

Not O
even O
that. O

YUMMY. O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
that O
you O
have O
to O
make O
a O
reservation. O

I O
thought O
for O
a O
long O
time O
about O
where O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O

I O
chose O
the O
restaurant O
"Escalibur". O

And O
I O
was O
not O
mistaken. O

I O
booked O
a O
table, O
talked O
about O
all O
the O
nuances O
of O
the O
event. O

And O
on O
May O
31 O
we O
visited O
this O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
with O
my O
friends! O

Everyone O
was O
delighted! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
medieval O
castle, O
the O
decor B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
exceeded O
all O
expectations. O

The O
prices O
were O
reasonable, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
tastefully O
decorated O
in O
an O
original O
way, O
and O
most O
importantly O
everything O
was O
very O
delicious, O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
good. O

You O
could O
see O
at O
once O
that O
everything O
was B-TARGET
fresh! O

You O
can O
see O
that O
each O
dish B-TARGET
has O
its O
author's O
caring O
attitude. O

We O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
receptionists B-TARGET
Elena O
and O
Marina, O
and O
waiter B-TARGET
Nicholay. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
friendly, O
polite, O
attentive O
and O
discreet O
service. B-TARGET

All O
of O
my O
requests O
for O
the O
organization O
and O
execution O
of O
my O
holiday O
were O
taken O
into O
account, O
that O
is, O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
run O
and O
remind O
them. O

We O
left O
satisfied O
and O
satiated O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
pleasant O
impressions! O

I O
should O
also O
note O
as O
someone O
who O
is O
fond O
of O
photography, O
that O
the O
photos O
on O
the O
background O
of O
this O
wonderful O
medieval O
interior B-TARGET
is O
fantastic! O

The O
color, B-TARGET
the O
light, B-TARGET
the O
design B-TARGET
of O
the O
walls O
- O
everything O
goes O
together O
very O
well. O

It O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
we O
were O
in O
another O
time, O
in O
another O
dimension. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone! O

Had O
our O
first O
visit O
to O
this O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
two O
months O
ago. O

Impressed B-TARGET
by I-TARGET
everything. I-TARGET

Great O
beer B-TARGET
(especially O
barley O
beer O
:) O
and O
suzhuk B-TARGET
as O
an O
appetizer O
:), O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
friendly O
staff! B-TARGET

Miniature O
girl B-TARGET
(in O
my O
opinion, O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant) O
is O
a O
high O
professional: O
discreet O
service, B-TARGET
friendly O
approach B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
visitors, I-TARGET
attentive O
to B-TARGET
customers. I-TARGET

I O
seldom O
get O
such O
a O
good O
impression O
of O
European O
service O
in O
the O
city O
on O
the O
Neva. O

Although O
there O
are O
many O
such O
institutions O
in O
the O
city, O
and O
want O
to O
visit O
more O
than O
once O
would O
only O
worthy O
places O
... O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O

I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
anniversary O
by O
inviting O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
in O
small O
groups. O

I O
took O
advantage O
of O
the O
action O
on O
myfant.ru O
Very O
pleased O
that O
I O
chose O
"Oriental B-TARGET
Express". I-TARGET

An O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
sit O
and O
chat O
in O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
for O
people O
who O
are O
not O
very O
young. O

All O
three O
times O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
smoking O
area O
- O
very O
nice O
and O
comfortable O
sofas. B-TARGET

Good O
ventilation B-TARGET
and O
less O
crowded. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
were O
great O
for O
me O
and O
my O
guests. O

Many O
thanks O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
at O
the O
restaurant. O

Would O
love O
to O
go O
again O
without O
any O
specials. O

Of O
the O
dishes O
that O
I O
took, O
I O
liked O
most O
of O
all O
the O
salad B-TARGET
"Caucasian" I-TARGET
- O
tender O
with O
an O
original O
sourness O
of O
grapefruit. B-TARGET

Salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lightly I-TARGET
salted I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
was O
also O
good. O

Delicious O
- O
originally O
served O
with O
a O
vegetable B-TARGET
side I-TARGET
dish. I-TARGET

Trout B-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and O
parsley O
sauce O
- O
delicious, O
light O
and O
nicely O
decorated. O

I O
wanted O
to O
try O
the O
chebureks. O

We O
took O
one O
portion O
(two O
large O
chebureks) O
for O
four O
people. O

Tar-tar O
sauce O
to O
go O
with O
it. O

Light O
thin O
dough, B-TARGET
juicy O
meat B-TARGET
- O
fine. O

Mors O
- O
made O
of B-TARGET
natural I-TARGET
cranberry, I-TARGET
like O
homemade. O

For O
dessert O
- O
we O
had O
cherry B-TARGET
strudel I-TARGET
(a O
lot O
of O
cherries B-TARGET
and O
an O
ice O
cream O
scoop), O
hot O
apple B-TARGET
pie O
(also O
liked), O
strawberry B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
- O
in O
my O
opinion O
panakota B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
strawberry I-TARGET
puree, I-TARGET
(tender O
and O
tasty). O

In O
general, O
we O
had O
a O
great O
time O
and O
tasty O
food O
at O
this O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
were O
there O
on O
Saturday O
and O
surprisingly O
there O
weren't O
too O
many O
people O
there. O

Nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
(a O
little O
bit O
loud O
it O
seemed O
really). O

Ordered O
Peking B-TARGET
duck I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
in O
the O
afternoon O
(important!) O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
food B-TARGET
in O
the O
evening. O

Overall O
impression O
- O
great O
place, B-TARGET
there O
are O
of O
course O
a O
few O
drawbacks: O
tea O
for O
what O
they O
brought O
in O
the O
beginning O
(asked O
the O
girl B-TARGET
to O
stop O
doing O
the O
ceremony O
tea, O
but O
apparently O
she O
does O
not O
speak O
Russian O
:))), O
portions B-TARGET
are O
certainly O
not O
as O
large O
as O
usual O
in O
Chinese O
restaurants O
(especially O
rice O
- O
have O
not O
seen O
anywhere O
else:))), O
and O
soup B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
duck I-TARGET
and O
have O
not O
brought. O

But O
otherwise, O
everything O
was O
fine: O
and O
the O
girl B-TARGET
administrator I-TARGET
(helped O
us O
to O
make O
a O
choice O
of O
dishes), O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
in O
the O
hall B-TARGET
is O
not O
smoky, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
even O
very O
fast, O
attentive O
waitresses, B-TARGET
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

In O
general O
a O
decent O
Chinese B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
the O
food O
of O
course O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
in O
"Harbin" O
but O
worth O
it. O

Would O
recommend O
our O
chef O
for O
next O
time. O

Thank O
you. O

We O
came O
to O
Aragvi O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
February. O

We O
had O
a O
large O
company, O
and O
we O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

I O
liked O
everything O
about O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
and O
the O
atmosphere. B-TARGET
It O
was O
my O
favorite O
restaurant B-TARGET
at O
once, O
and O
we O
visit O
it O
from O
time O
to O
time. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
on O
April O
16. O

We O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance O
just O
in O
case. O

Despite O
being O
a O
weekday O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
occupied, O
so O
the O
reservation O
was O
very O
appropriate. O

The O
food B-TARGET
at O
Aragvi O
is O
very O
tasty O
and O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
wait O
long. O

We O
ordered O
some O
greens B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
vegetables, I-TARGET
and O
they O
brought O
us O
a O
whole O
basket O
of O
them.) O

Shashlik B-TARGET
to O
some O
people O
like O
veal, O
some O
like O
pork. O

Very O
tasty O
chebureks! B-TARGET

There O
are O
not O
many O
desserts, B-TARGET
but O
very O
tasty O
too. O

I O
tried O
a O
light O
dessert O
and O
baked O
pears. O
We O
did O
not O
have O
any O
Georgian B-TARGET
wines, I-TARGET
but O
they O
are O
not O
available O
anywhere. O

Music B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
not O
loud, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
conducive O
to O
communication. O

So O
if O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
quiet O
and O
nice O
place O
to O
eat O
inexpensive O
and O
tasty O
place, O
Aragvi B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
option! O

I've O
read O
negative O
reviews O
about O
this O
restaurant, O
but O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
and O
I O
thought O
that O
they O
were O
exaggerated. O

I O
will O
tell O
you O
from O
my O
own O
experience, O
the O
service B-TARGET
as O
such O
there O
is O
simply O
absent. O

It O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
receive O
an O
order, O
in O
a O
huge O
hall O
were O
taken O
three O
tables O
(!). O

Then O
we O
wait O
for O
the O
drinks. O

An O
orange O
juice O
was O
brought, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
orange B-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
(!). O
The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
specified O
what O
kind O
of O
juice O
to O
replace O
it O
with O
and O
left. O

We O
are O
waiting O
for O
10-15 O
minutes O
drink O
are O
not O
brought. O

Only O
after O
we O
went O
to O
the O
bar, O
and O
recalled O
the O
juice O
brought. O

Later O
brought O
food. O

There O
are O
no O
napkins O
or O
spices O
on O
the O
table, O
they O
just O
did O
not O
bring O
them. O

Signs O
were O
made O
again. O

Did O
not O
like O
the O
food. B-TARGET

Inconsistency O
in O
price O
and O
quality. O

Everything O
is O
pretty, O
but O
not O
very O
tasty. O

Only O
the O
coffee B-TARGET
was O
good. O

There O
were O
no O
pastries B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu. O

We O
left O
disappointed, O
we O
lost O
1.5-2 O
hours, O
but O
we O
didn't O
have O
any O
fun. O

I O
really O
like O
Chinese O
food O
and O
my O
husband O
prefers O
Japanese. O

It O
seemed O
to O
be O
an O
ideal O
choice. O

It O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
get O
ready O
and O
we O
arrived O
by O
the O
night. O

Of O
course O
we O
were O
all O
tired O
at O
11 O
pm. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
not O
attentive O
and O
didn't O
take O
notes O
as O
if O
she O
was O
drugged. O
As O
a O
result O
after O
25 O
minutes O
of O
waiting O
the O
wrong O
dish O
was O
brought. O

We O
refused. O

Time O
was O
late O
and O
we O
couldn't O
eat O
much O
but O
after O
3 O
dishes O
of O
Chinese B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
and O
2 O
of O
Japanese O
we O
couldn't O
find O
any O
really O
tasty O
dish. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
pretentious O
and O
not O
tasty. O

In O
addition, O
the O
bill O
already O
included O
a O
tip O
and O
it O
was O
10%, O
for O
such O
service B-TARGET
I O
did O
not O
give O
and O
2 O
x. O

The O
only O
good O
thing O
about O
it O
was O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

But O
the O
furniture B-TARGET
is O
very O
uncomfortable. O

Overall, O
we O
will O
not O
go O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
again. O

We O
liked O
absolutely O
everything!!! O

It O
was O
a O
very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Great O
banquet B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
affordable O
prices. O

Really O
tasty O
"kebab" B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
assortment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

We O
celebrated O
New O
Year O
with O
friends O
and O
family. O

It O
was O
really O
fun! O

There O
was O
a O
positive O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
because O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
homely O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
friendly. O

Interesting O
entertainment B-TARGET
and O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O

We O
celebrated O
the O
New O
Year O
and O
will O
check O
it O
out O
again O
later O
this O
year. O

We O
came O
on O
the O
18th O
January O
and O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
boring O
but O
we O
were O
wrong. O

Everything O
was O
good O
as O
it O
was O
on O
New O
Year O
and O
the O
musicians B-TARGET
did O
not O
let O
us O
get O
bored. O

A O
good O
hookah B-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices. O

I O
give O
this O
place O
5 O
out O
of O
5 O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
friends O
and O
family. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
came O
by O
chance, O
I O
wanted O
to O
drink O
coffee. O

I O
was O
immediately O
spellbound O
by O
the B-TARGET
staff, I-TARGET
who O
welcomed O
me O
as O
if O
they O
were O
expecting O
me O
and O
welcomed O
me O
back. O

The B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
cakes B-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

Then O
we O
went O
there O
several O
times O
with O
our O
friends O
to O
have O
a O
drink O
and O
a O
beer. O

The O
choice O
of O
beer B-TARGET
is O
not O
large, O
but O
it O
is O
normal O
after O
all O
it O
is O
more O
a O
bakery... O

Although O
all O
found O
a O
drink B-TARGET
to O
their O
liking, O
there O
are O
Timmermans B-TARGET
and O
Nevskoye. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
appetizers: B-TARGET
fried B-TARGET
wings I-TARGET
and O
calamari B-TARGET
especially. O

They're O
served O
with O
onion O
rings O
too. O

No O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
found O
on O
the O
menu O
but O
the O
friendly O
girl/waitress B-TARGET
when O
we O
asked O
about O
it O
suggested O
two O
different O
sauces O
and O
she O
brought O
them O
right O
away. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad O
but O
it O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
there O
are O
sofas O
and O
a O
plasma O
screen O
in O
the O
non-smoking O
room O
only. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
good O
at O
10, O
on O
time, O
nice O
and O
smiling. O

It's O
great O
that O
there O
is O
such O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
in O
our O
neighbourhood. O

I O
brought O
a O
friend O
to O
the O
restaurant O
- O
he O
had O
an O
appointment O
there. O

It O
was O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
not O
very O
crowded. O

The O
first O
thing O
that O
struck O
the O
eye O
- O
polite O
staff. B-TARGET

With O
a O
smile O
they O
opened O
the O
door, O
offered O
to O
leave O
my O
coat, O
quickly O
brought O
the O
menu O
and O
came O
to O
ask O
for O
an O
order O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
chose O
the O
desired O
one O
(and O
how O
did O
they O
understand O
that?). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
made O
in O
pleasant O
light O
colors, O
there O
are O
comfortable O
(interesting) O
tables B-TARGET
near O
the O
walls, O
but O
the O
seats B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
center O
of O
the O
restaurant O
are O
a O
little O
disappointing O
because O
they O
are O
very O
uncomfortable. O

The O
order O
was O
brought O
very O
quickly O
and O
everything O
was O
cooked O
very O
well O
and O
tasty. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
medium, O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
well O
presented. O

So O
we O
have O
only O
good O
impressions O
of O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
La B-TARGET
Fabrik I-TARGET
for O
a O
pleasant O
evening!) O

We O
visited O
on O
March O
10. O

I O
have O
very O
nice O
impression O
of O
it. O

I O
have O
read O
the O
previous O
reviews. O

I O
don't O
know, O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
it's O
because O
of O
the O
competitors! O
:)) O

I O
myself O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
in O
the O
Pauliner, O
and O
there O
is O
always O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

About O
beer B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
to O
say, O
it O
is O
above O
all O
praise! O

Yes, O
about O
the O
tables... O
we've O
never O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
ordering O
it... O

This O
time O
we O
ordered O
on O
the O
same O
day. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
polite O
and O
didn't O
make O
us O
feel O
bad. O

Our O
table O
was O
served O
by O
a O
girl B-TARGET
called O
Maria. O

Very O
friendly O
girl! B-TARGET

At O
our O
table O
never O
had O
more O
than O
two O
cinders O
in O
an O
ashtray, O
with O
such O
a O
frequency O
she O
changed O
them. O

She O
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
always O
came O
up O
to O
us O
to O
check O
if O
we O
needed O
anything O
else. O

And O
at O
the O
same O
time O
it O
did O
not O
seem O
somehow O
intrusive. O

Hot O
meal O
was O
brought O
in O
15 O
minutes O
after O
ordering, O
we O
didn't O
even O
expect O
such O
an O
efficiency! O

In O
general, O
the O
impressions O
are O
very O
positive! O
(However, O
as O
always!) O

Definitely O
will O
come O
here O
again O
and O
again! O

For O
me O
the O
restaurant O
is O
food O
first O
of O
all, O
then O
service O
and O
only O
after O
that O
the O
interior O
and O
location. O

I O
went O
there O
again O
yesterday O
and O
understood: O
if O
you O
want O
a O
no-frills O
option O
you O
have O
to O
go O
here. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
establishments O
opening O
and O
closing O
in O
the O
city. O

What O
surprises O
me O
is O
that O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
(quality) O
has O
not O
changed O
for O
8 O
years. O

It's O
worth O
it. O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
large O
and O
very O
filling. O

The O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

Cook O
quickly O
but O
QUALITY! O

In O
general, O
5 O
for O
food. B-TARGET

Interior? O

On O
the O
whole, O
I O
like O
it. O

Quite O
stylish, O
the O
tones O
are O
very O
well O
chosen. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
curtain O
the O
large B-TARGET
windows I-TARGET
overlooking O
the O
Nekrasov O
Street O
with O
translucent O
tulle. O

The O
large O
window O
openings B-TARGET
look O
a O
bit O
bare. O

I O
would O
give O
the O
service B-TARGET
a O
4. O

All O
is O
fine O
and O
fast O
but O
it's O
obvious O
that O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
aren't O
pros. O

I O
personally O
don't O
mind O
it. O

The O
service O
was O
surprising O
that O
after O
EVERY O
visitor O
the O
white O
tablecloth O
on O
the O
table O
changes, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
absolutely O
clean. O

I O
was O
pleased O
to O
see O
that. O

In O
general, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

And O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
talk O
(music B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
soft) O
and O
bring O
the O
lady O
and O
a O
birthday O
party. O

I O
went O
and O
will O
go. O

Zalizhim O
with O
my O
husband O
to O
have O
dinner O
on O
Friday O
(17.01.14) O
at O
23:00. O

First O
welcomed O
us O
valet, B-TARGET
helped O
to O
park O
and O
even O
opened O
the O
door O
and O
greeted O
us O
politely. O

I O
like O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
I O
like O
the O
design. B-TARGET

It's O
simple O
and O
tasteful, O
with O
lots O
of O
interesting O
little O
details. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
nice O
girl. B-TARGET

We O
didn't O
remember O
her O
name. O

The O
main O
thing O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
room O
is O
clean O
and O
the O
dining O
area O
is O
well O
ventilated. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
large O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
magazine, O
there O
is O
everything.... O
cooked, O
sushi, O
wok, O
pasta, O
etc. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
design I-TARGET
is O
interesting, O
the O
designers O
are O
great! O

I O
had O
cream O
of O
porcini O
mushroom O
soup O
(about O
350 O
p.) O
and O
penne O
with O
duck O
( O
450 O
p.). O

The O
soup B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
just O
divine. O

A O
lot O
of O
sauce, B-TARGET
soft O
duck B-TARGET
meat. I-TARGET

I O
was O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
pasta))) B-TARGET

My O
husband O
had O
beef O
salad O
and O
carpaccio O
(I O
don't O
remember O
the O
price). O

We O
liked O
everything O
very O
much. O

We O
had O
positive O
emotions O
from O
the O
visit...chatted O
and O
had O
a O
great O
meal! O

We O
will O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
again. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
cooks B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
for O
the O
good O
vibe! O

Perhaps O
there O
was O
a O
"work O
on O
mistakes", O
but O
maybe O
we O
were O
just O
lucky O
;) O
On O
February O
23 O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
I O
visited O
this O
restaurant. O

Maybe O
we O
can O
pick O
on O
it O
a O
bit, O
but O
on O
the O
whole O
we O
did O
not O
have O
any O
particular O
criticism. O

Very O
polite O
waitresses B-TARGET
welcoming O
all O
guests O
at O
the O
entrance. O

We O
had O
ordered O
a O
table O
in O
advance, O
so O
there O
were O
no O
problems O
with O
seats. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
cozy O
and O
the O
sofas B-TARGET
are O
comfortable. O

Perhaps O
too O
soft O
and O
sinking, O
but O
for O
a O
relaxing O
evening O
in O
a O
good O
company O
- O
just O
right. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
who O
served O
our O
table O
(I O
do O
not O
know O
the O
name, O
unfortunately) O
- O
attentive O
and O
courteous, O
happy O
to O
answer O
all O
our O
questions. O

Dirty O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
did O
not O
linger, O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
remind O
them O
of O
the O
utensils, O
and O
the O
ashtray O
was O
replaced O
in O
years. O

Stunningly O
delicious O
specialty O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
unexpectedly O
(for O
a O
Japanese O
restaurant) O
large O
portions B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
food. O

No O
complaints O
about O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
hot O
dishes O
could O
have O
been O
a O
bit O
faster O
but O
we O
were O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
and O
to O
the O
smooth O
flow O
of O
the O
evening O
a O
slight O
delay O
mostly O
fit O
in. O

In O
general O
- O
the O
impressions O
are O
only O
positive, O
I O
think O
we O
will O
come O
again O
- O
especially O
since O
we O
do O
not O
live O
far O
away. O

Good O
afternoon! O

I O
am O
writing O
about O
our O
impressions O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
saw O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
advertisement O
in O
the O
food O
court O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
and O
we O
didn't O
regret O
it! O

We O
went O
upstairs O
to O
the O
4th O
floor O
of O
the O
Sporting O
Club). O

At O
the O
entrance O
was O
greeted O
by O
a O
girl O
(waiter) O

She O
took O
us O
to O
a O
table O
near O
the O
window O
(a O
beautiful O
view), B-TARGET
served O
a O
menu. O

There O
are O
not O
many O
options B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
but O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
choose O
from! O

A O
vegetable O
smoothie, O
smooth O
smooth O
smoothie O
cereals, O
tea O
tea O
(like O
multifit), O
salad O
with O
cottage O
cheese, O
arugula O
with O
shrimps, O
roll O
of O
salmon O
with O
green O
asparagus O
and O
grilled O
tuna O
with O
vegetables. O

Drinks O
were O
served O
quickly, O
followed O
by O
salads O
and O
hot O
dishes. O

Everything O
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
beautiful! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
amazing: O
furniture, B-TARGET
dishes, B-TARGET
dishes, B-TARGET
views B-TARGET
out I-TARGET
the O
window, O
candles, B-TARGET
service! B-TARGET

In O
general, O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
liked O
it O
VERY O
much! O

We O
will O
come O
again O
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
our O
friends! O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
wonderful! O

Very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
staff B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance, O
you O
have O
the O
feeling O
that O
you've O
been O
waiting O
to O
visit! O

There O
is O
a O
big O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
they O
cooked O
them O
fast O
and O
really O
good. O

Portions B-TARGET
of O
food O
are O
big O
and O
you O
can O
take O
away O
what O
you O
have O
left. O

I O
liked O
that O
we O
have O
very O
calm O
and O
soft O
music B-TARGET
in O
a O
very O
relaxing O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
amazing O
and O
felt O
like O
you O
were O
in O
a O
fairy O
tale. O

The O
evening O
was O
memorable O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

Thank O
you! O

Great O
place! B-TARGET

My O
wife O
and O
I O
had O
our O
wedding O
anniversary O
and O
we O
always O
go O
to O
a O
new O
restaurant O
on O
that O
day. O

There O
are O
quite O
a O
few O
restaurants O
in O
St. O
Petersburg, O
but O
this O
time O
our O
choice O
fell O
on O
Legran. O

We O
had O
heard O
too O
many O
good O
things O
about O
it. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
it O
was O
a O
wonderful O
evening, O
respect O
to O
the B-TARGET
chef! I-TARGET

Everything O
was O
incredibly O
delicious O
and O
original! O

The O
interior, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
immediately O
struck O
by O
the O
pretty O
little O
Christmas O
tree B-TARGET
and O
thuja B-TARGET
outside, O
Christmas O
lights, B-TARGET
cozy O
and O
chic O
inside, O
soft O
couches, B-TARGET
candles, B-TARGET
a O
white B-TARGET
grand I-TARGET
piano. I-TARGET

In O
our O
case O
it O
was O
just O
100% O
a O
hit, O
and O
the O
evening O
was O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
the O
pianist B-TARGET
played O
a O
white O
grand O
piano. O

It O
was O
beautiful! O

I O
can O
say O
I O
was O
very O
impressed O
by O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
welcomed O
by O
a O
smiling O
hostess B-TARGET
and O
the O
overall O
impression O
was O
positive O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
attentive O
and O
polite, O
I O
can O
not O
remember O
a O
time O
when O
we O
did O
not O
like O
something! O

Great O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
general O
and O
would O
recommend O
to O
all O
and O
would O
gladly O
go O
back O
there O
again. O

Thank O
you! O

I O
and O
my O
friends O
really O
like O
it, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
receptionists B-TARGET
are O
always O
trying O
to O
help. O

I O
can't O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
security O
guards O
- O
we O
have O
never O
once O
had O
them O
beat O
anyone O
up O
before O
(we O
are O
in O
the O
restaurant O
almost O
every O
week). O

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
that O
in O
the O
evenings, O
somewhere O
from O
9 O
o'clock, O
there O
is O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
and O
you O
can O
dance O
and O
have O
a O
great O
time. O

The O
staff O
are O
decent, O
prices O
are O
reasonable, O
the O
brewery B-TARGET
itself O
makes O
excellent O
wheat B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
barley I-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
snacks B-TARGET
are O
also O
very O
good, O
tasty O
cheese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
platter, I-TARGET
excellent O
milk B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
alcoholic I-TARGET
cocktails. I-TARGET

Overall, O
a O
very O
good, O
decent O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat, O
although O
it's O
disappointing O
that O
the O
tables O
for O
Thursday, O
Friday O
and O
the O
weekend O
need O
to O
be O
booked O
out O
about O
3 O
weeks O
in O
advance. O

But O
anyway O
I O
recommend O
to O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
you O
won't O
regret O
it! O

Hi. O

Had O
my O
birthday O
party O
here. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
liked O
about O
it O
was O
that O
they O
walked O
us O
in O
and O
told O
us O
that O
I O
had O
a O
reservation. O

The O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
is O
just O
a O
paradise O
=) O

Very O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
so O
gentle O
and O
cozy. O

For O
this O
10 O
even O
with O
a O
plus!!! O

Next O
thing O
is... O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
options, O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
was O
varied O
for O
every O
taste, O
but O
after O
a O
closer O
look O
at O
the O
fish, O
because O
I O
personally O
did O
not O
like O
anything O
else O
(you O
can O
eat O
pizza O
in O
other O
more O
specialized O
places, O
pasta... O
well, O
I O
would O
do O
it O
at O
home, O
soup... O
not O
for O
a O
party). O

Prices O
for O
wine B-TARGET
are O
insane...although, O
maybe O
for O
such O
a O
restaurant O
this O
is O
normal, O
but O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
food, O
it O
seemed O
expensive O
to O
me! O

In O
general O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
close O
to O
Italian, O
but O
something O
super O
spectacular O
I O
did O
not O
see, O
so O
only O
8. O

As O
for O
service...I B-TARGET
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
there O
are O
no O
complaints, O
plates O
were O
cleaned O
in O
time, O
but O
the O
girls B-TARGET
were O
not O
interested O
in O
us. O

There O
were O
not O
many O
people O
around O
(there O
was O
a O
large O
company O
at O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us), O
so O
it O
could O
have O
been O
quicker O
and O
livelier. O

We, O
seven O
of O
us, O
left O
five O
thousand, O
but O
we O
didn't O
get O
any O
satisfaction O
from O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
reception, B-TARGET
although O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
beautifully O
served O
and O
decorated. O

For O
service B-TARGET
only O
6. O

Yesterday O
we O
were O
in O
the O
restaurant O
"Sky" O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
what O
I O
can O
say. O
1. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
in O
particular O
- O
sushi, B-TARGET
rolls, B-TARGET
pork B-TARGET
shish I-TARGET
kebab, I-TARGET
warm B-TARGET
Mexican I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
(I O
recommend O
it)!!! O
2. O

Slightly O
not O
comfortable, O
from O
the O
large B-TARGET
space I-TARGET
and O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
(in O
winter), O
but O
in O
summer O
- O
the O
super O
views B-TARGET
out I-TARGET
the O
window!!! O
3. O

Service B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
very O
good, O
from O
welcoming B-TARGET
guests I-TARGET
to O
seeing B-TARGET
them I-TARGET
off. I-TARGET

3. O
In O
my O
opinion O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
starting O
from O
the O
meeting O
with O
the O
guest B-TARGET
until O
the O
departure. O

Very O
nice O
overall O
experience! O

Can O
I O
recommend O
to O
anyone? O

We O
stayed O
on O
Saturday O
November O
24 O
knowing O
that O
we O
would O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
we O
booked O
a O
table O
for O
10 O
people O
in O
advance O
(classmates O
meeting). O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
we O
could O
find O
a O
table O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
people. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
chosen O
for O
the O
following O
reasons: O
to O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
and O
to O
be O
able O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
large O
company, O
and O
still O
be O
a O
familiar O
place. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
but O
maybe O
for O
such O
environs O
this O
is O
normal. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
but O
can O
be O
an O
improvement O
on O
this O
kind O
of O
inn. O

They O
should O
at O
least O
make O
a O
separate O
zone O
for O
smokers. O

I O
liked O
the O
salad B-TARGET
Dor-bru I-TARGET
(tomatoes, O
cucumbers, O
peppers, O
fresh O
raw O
mushrooms, O
cheese O
Dor-bru, O
butter), O
specialty B-TARGET
sausages I-TARGET
for I-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
which O
when O
served O
on O
fire, O
to O
be O
honest, O
I O
thought O
that O
the O
specialty O
should O
be O
sturdier. O

The B-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
grill O
was O
not O
like O
that. O

Music B-TARGET
is O
playing O
loudly O
so O
waitresses B-TARGET
do O
not O
call O
and O
do O
not O
hear O
the O
dish O
to O
order, O
sometimes O
you O
wait O
50 O
minutes, O
but O
it O
turns O
out O
it O
has O
not O
been O
ordered O
you O
wait O
another O
50 O
minutes O
(It O
says O
in O
the O
menu O
cooking O
time O
of O
40-50 O
minutes). O

The O
girl B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
all O
the O
time O
said O
that O
she O
does O
not O
cook O
faster O
and O
very O
tortured O
look. O

In O
general, O
not O
bad. O

You O
can O
go O
for O
a O
beer B-TARGET
with O
sausages B-TARGET
in O
the O
evening. O

But O
with O
children O
it O
is O
better O
to O
come O
before O
15.00 O
it O
is O
less O
crowded O
and O
children's O
parties O
before O
that O
time. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice! O

I O
had O
a O
very O
exciting O
and O
important O
event O
associated O
with O
it...my O
future O
husband O
proposed O
to O
me O
at O
this O
restaurant O
(by O
the O
way, O
the O
wedding O
is O
in O
a O
week O
and O
we O
will O
celebrate O
it O
only O
there). O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
10. O

We O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
menu O
as O
we O
usually O
do O
in O
some O
restaurants. O

We O
sat O
down, O
ordered O
Georgian O
food O
and O
champagne O
and O
in O
about O
5 O
minutes O
we O
had O
the O
most O
delicious O
champagne B-TARGET
that O
I O
have O
ever O
had. O
.... O

We O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
for O
our O
order, O
about O
20 O
minutes. O

We O
ate O
and O
ate O
and O
couldn't O
enjoy O
the O
food, B-TARGET
it O
was O
so O
delicious O
and O
unusual, O
because O
it O
was O
my O
first O
time O
in O
a O
Georgian O
restaurant. O

It O
is O
calm O
there, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
so O
calm O
and O
oriental O
...))). O

To O
tell O
the O
truth, O
I O
don't O
remember O
if O
it O
was O
live O
or O
not, O
I O
guess O
not. O

We O
were O
there O
during O
the O
day O
and O
I O
know O
for O
sure O
there O
was O
a O
program O
in O
the O
evening. O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much!!!! O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
restaurant O
for O
some O
important O
event, O
you O
can O
safely O
go O
to O
"TBILISO" B-TARGET
!!! O

If O
you O
don't O
like O
it, O
you O
can O
beat O
me O
up...:-)))) O

Visited O
the O
restaurant O
Yalta O
11.05.12, O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
Birthday, O

We O
ordered O
a O
table O
for O
8 O
people O
a O
day O
before O
the O
celebration, O

When O
ordering O
they O
showed O
us O
the O
restaurant O
and O
offered O
several O
options O
for O
the O
placement O
of O
our O
guests, O

We O
chose O
a O
separate O
two O
tables O
surrounded O
by O
sofas O
and O
chairs, O
next O
to O
the O
panoramic O
window, O

Prepayment O
for O
an O
order O
did O
not O
leave, O
(which O
advantageously O
distinguished O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
from O
others, O
given O
that O
our O
event O
was O
scheduled O
for O
Friday O
night). O

Beneficially O
the O
restaurant O
has O
a O
relaxed O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
pleasant, O
not O
loud O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
which O
leaves O
a O
chance O
for O
a O
pleasant O
conversation. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
not O
intrusive, O
I O
would O
say O
inconspicuous, O
very O
nice O
waiters, B-TARGET
immediately O
brought O
a O
vase O
for O
flowers, O
took O
orders, O
all O
very O
polite, O
with O
good O
knowledge B-TARGET
of O
the O
menu O
and O
friendliness. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
with O
variety O
and O
a O
good O
informative O
menu B-TARGET
which O
made O
it O
easy O
to O
choose O
a O
dish O
to O
any O
taste O
as O
Japanese, O
Russian O
and O
Georgian O
dishes O
were O
presented. O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
big, O
utensils B-TARGET
are O
good, O
and O
the O
taste O
is O
excellent. O

The O
check O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
higher O
than O
in O
other O
restaurants O
of O
this O
class, O
but O
our O
positive O
emotions O
were O
worth O
it. O

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
time O
and O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

We O
had O
our O
lunch O
at O
5pm O
on O
a O
Saturday O
in O
early O
December. O

Of O
course O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
there. O

Of O
course O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
there. O
We O
waited O
for O
an O
hour O
for O
our O
order, O
so O
even O
the O
salads O
were O
served O
only O
an O
hour O
later O
and O
together O
with O
something O
hot O
for O
some O
reason. O

At O
the O
next O
table O
they O
mixed O
up O
the O
order O
and O
after O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting O
people O
got O
not O
what O
they O
wanted. O

Pasta B-TARGET
and O
risotto B-TARGET
were O
not O
bad. O

We O
didn't O
expect O
anything O
special O
but O
we O
had O
just O
come O
for O
lunch. O

We O
didn't O
like O
the O
long O
wait O
and O
the O
estrangement O
of O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
who O
went O
outside O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
bench... O
while O
we O
wanted O
to O
pay. O

Stayed O
for O
10 O
minutes, O
chatted O
with O
someone O
and O
finally O
came O
to O
us, O
but O
with O
the O
kind O
of O
type O
of O
what? O
Do O
not O
wait O
or O
... O
politeness O
and O
a O
desire O
to O
serve O
guests O
I O
have O
not O
noticed. O

Breakfast O
is O
not O
very O
hot, O
but O
we O
were O
not O
lucky O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
soups B-TARGET
are O
delicious. O

I O
will O
visit O
again O
for O
tea O
and O
dessert O
if O
I O
walk O
by. O

I O
used O
to O
go O
there O
often. O
First O
of O
all, O
it O
is O
in O
a O
comfortable O
place O
for O
me, O
and O
secondly, O
I O
have O
a O
card O
with O
a O
10% O
discount. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
good, O
I O
can't O
say O
anything, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
maintenance B-TARGET
in O
recent O
time O
(since O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
summer) O
leave O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

Waitresses B-TARGET
constantly O
forget O
something, O
with O
a O
small O
number O
of O
visitors O
the O
order O
must O
wait O
sometimes O
up O
to O
40-50 O
minutes!!! O

Given O
that O
we O
do O
not O
take O
hot O
food. O

Beer B-TARGET
on O
draft O
brought O
not O
that O
without O
foam, O
no O
bubbles..... O

So O
now O
we O
choose O
other O
sushi O
bars... O

Hopefully O
wasabi B-TARGET
will O
change O
again O
for O
the O
better. O

Good O
luck. O

Anna O

With O
colleagues O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
noisy O
company. O

Our O
choice O
was O
the O
new O
pub O
"John O
Donne". O

Overall O
we O
got O
the O
best O
impressions. O

When O
you O
come O
into O
the O
pub, O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
greeted O
in O
a O
friendly O
manner O
and O
then O
a O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
offered O
us O
a O
couple O
of O
tables O
to O
choose O
from. O

Almost O
immediately O
we O
were O
served O
a O
menu O
and O
were O
told O
that O
this O
place O
has O
a O
very O
interesting O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
since O
we O
were O
not O
familiar O
with O
the O
range O
of O
English O
beer, O
we O
were O
given O
comments O
on O
the O
items O
of O
interest O
and O
even O
brought O
a O
small O
amount O
to O
try, O
which O
is O
certainly O
nice! O

We O
tried O
almost O
the O
whole O
beer O
lineup O
and O
we O
all O
found O
beers B-TARGET
to O
our O
liking. O

We O
were O
happy O
with O
the O
cuisine, B-TARGET
we O
had O
a O
big O
beer B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
which O
was O
really O
tasty! O

Variety O
of O
appetizers B-TARGET
is O
not O
banal O
as O
in O
most O
places. O

As O
for O
the O
hot O
dishes O
I O
can O
recommend O
Fish B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Chips I-TARGET
and O
Streak B-TARGET
New I-TARGET
York. I-TARGET

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
my O
colleague O
wanted O
a O
dessert O
and O
ordered O
sorbet B-TARGET
but O
after O
getting O
150 O
rubles O
for O
50 O
gr, O
that O
is O
one O
ball, O
she O
got O
upset O
a O
little O
bit. O

After O
all, O
it's O
a O
bit O
expensive. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
nice O
and O
classic O
for O
a O
pub, O
soccer O
matches O
are O
broadcast O
on O
TV. O

Overall O
a O
nice, O
homely O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
again O
and O
again! O

Had O
a O
birthday O
party O
in O
this O
restaurant O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
on O
Saturday O
night. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
in O
advance O
to O
the O
management B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
service B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
cooks O
tasty O
meals B-TARGET
for O
visitors O
to O
the O
place. O

I O
enjoyed O
it O
absolutely. O

Of O
course O
impressed O
by O
the O
interior: B-TARGET
it's O
cozy O
and O
beautiful. O

The O
table B-TARGET
was O
gorgeous. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
waiter B-TARGET
Bahram, O
thanks O
to O
him. O

Please O
note O
that O
the O
prices O
were O
not O
expensive O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
of O
such O
a O
high O
level. O

I O
was O
there O
with O
my O
husband O
to O
celebrate O
our O
anniversary. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
long O
waiting O
time O
(15-20 O
min) O
while O
we O
were O
invited O
in, O
though O
it O
was O
rather O
late O
and O
when O
we O
entered O
the O
hall O
it O
was O
half O
empty. O

Well... O

Don't O
be O
nervous... O

They're O
so O
friendly, O
it's O
a O
holiday O
after O
all... O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting. O

We O
ordered O
some O
dishes O
and O
I O
can't O
remember O
their O
names O
(I O
ordered O
something O
from O
chicken, O
and O
my O
husband O
wanted O
to O
try O
horse O
meat). O

The O
hot B-TARGET
meal O
took O
about O
10 O
minutes... O
Fast O
- O
I O
don't O
argue, O
but O
HOW O
can O
you O
cook O
horse O
meat O
in O
10 O
minutes? O

There O
was O
a O
complete O
feeling O
both O
from O
the O
look O
and O
from O
the O
taste O
that O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
had O
been O
standing O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
and O
were O
just O
heated O
in O
the O
microwave. O

No O
salt, B-TARGET
no O
spices, B-TARGET
absolutely O
bland O
food B-TARGET
(though O
I O
don't O
argue, O
some O
people O
like O
it O
that O
way, O
but O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
could O
have O
warned O
and O
put O
on O
the O
table O
more O
spices)! O

There O
was O
nothing O
to O
serve. O

We O
could O
not O
finish O
our O
meal. O

The O
mood O
was O
imported. O

Our O
salads O
made O
of B-TARGET
greens I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
were O
the O
most O
edible, O
don't O
you O
agree, O
it O
is O
really O
hard O
to O
ruin O
it. O

The O
prices O
are O
average O
in O
general, O
but O
with O
such O
a O
cuisine B-TARGET
absolutely O
unreasonable. O

We O
wouldn't O
go O
there O
again O
even O
for O
extra O
charge. O

It's O
a O
normal O
place, B-TARGET
but O
not O
"great" O
in O
my O
opinion. O

Firstly, O
it's O
very O
noisy: O
the O
hall B-TARGET
is O
small O
and O
when O
everyone O
is O
talking O
all O
at O
once O
(and O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
visitors) O
there O
is O
such O
a O
buzz O
that O
you O
can't O
hear O
what O
your O
seatmates O
are O
saying O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
rather O
close O
to O
each O
other. O

Secondly, O
quite O
expensive. O

Thirdly, O
the O
service: B-TARGET
it O
was O
very O
unpleasant O
to O
tramp O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
hall O
in O
your O
clothes O
(all O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
running O
around O
the O
hall, O
no O
one O
met O
and O
showed O
where O
the O
dressing O
room O
- O
it O
was O
a O
closet O
between O
the O
toilets:)), O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
brought O
first O
dishes O
and O
then O
the O
dishes, O
the O
bill O
was O
carried O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
when O
they O
left, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
checkroom O
gave O
not O
all O
jackets O
and O
went O
away... O
Little O
things, O
but O
they O
make O
an O
impression. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
and O
the O
location B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
were O
great. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
not O
bad, O
no O
complaints, O
I O
tasted O
ravioli B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
truffles I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
ricotta I-TARGET
(380 O
rubles) O
and O
pumpkin B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
parmesan I-TARGET
(380 O
rubles) O
(it O
so O
happened O
that O
I O
chose O
the O
most O
inexpensive O
dishes O
on O
the O
menu:)). O

Red O
"homemade" O
wine O
- O
260 O
rubles O
per O
glass. O

Check O
for O
4 O
girls O
with O
wine O
came O
out O
about O
6000 O
rubles. O

Hello! O
On O
December O
23, O
2013. O

We O
had O
a O
corporate O
party O
at O
Le B-TARGET
Glamour I-TARGET
restaurant O
(crystal O
hall) O
and O
we O
liked O
it O
very O
much! O

Great O
food, B-TARGET
top-notch O
service, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
inside O
is O
like O
in O
a O
picture, O
I O
haven't O
seen O
such O
a O
beauty O
for O
a O
long O
time=) O

Very O
nice O
and O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Greeting O
waiters, B-TARGET
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
beautiful O
interior. B-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
many O
times! O

Special O
thanks O
to O
our O
hostess B-TARGET
Kate O
;) O

We O
had O
our O
wedding O
19.04 O
at O
this O
restaurant, O
there O
weren't O
many O
guests, O
only O
45 O
people, O
we O
spent O
our O
time O
in O
the O
lower O
hall. O

I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
- O
very O
beautiful, O
interior B-TARGET
pleasing O
to O
the O
eye, O
and O
- O
secondly, O
we O
were O
fed O
to O
death)) O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
we O
took O
what O
was O
left O
over O
from O
the O
meal B-TARGET
and O
finished O
it O
at O
home. O

Of O
the O
menu O
we O
chose, O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
salad B-TARGET
"Laguna" I-TARGET
and O
the O
eggplant O
rolls. O
Eggplant O
and O
rolls B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushrooms. I-TARGET

Our O
main O
course O
was O
50/50 O
meat O
and O
fish. O

I O
chose O
the O
fish B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
trout, I-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
juicy O
and O
delicious. O

Thirdly, O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly. O

We O
chose O
Dima O
as O
a O
master O
of O
ceremonies. O

He O
was O
a O
very O
cheerful O
and O
positive O
person B-TARGET
and O
a O
professional O
in O
his O
work. O

Thanks O
to O
him O
in O
particular! O

The O
director B-TARGET
- O
the O
sincere O
man, O
all O
wishes O
are O
considered O
and O
advises O
what O
and O
how O
to O
make O
better. O

In O
the O
end O
I O
can O
say O
that O
we O
liked O
it! O
We O
had O
a O
good O
rest, O
nothing O
spoiled O
the O
mood, O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
mistakes, O
except O
for O
the O
little O
things, O
without O
which O
we O
understand, O
can O
not O
do. O

We O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
our O
choice O
of O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Thank O
you! O

And O
in O
my O
opinion, O
a O
very O
decent O
place. B-TARGET

I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

We O
went O
to O
the O
concert O
of O
the O
band O
"Tonight". O

It O
was O
amazing. O

As O
it O
turned O
out, O
the B-TARGET
guys I-TARGET
know O
how O
to O
rock O
on O
all O
100! O

The B-TARGET
audience, I-TARGET
from O
small O
to O
large, O
were O
partying O
all O
night O
long. O
But O
thanks O
to O
them O
personally, O
although O
the O
management B-TARGET
of O
the O
bar O
are O
also O
to O
thank O
for O
it O
- O
the O
concert O
was O
free! O

Also O
there's O
a O
very O
piquant O
bartender B-TARGET
- O
who O
looks O
like O
a O
chef O
from O
cartoons! O

I O
have O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
service B-TARGET
too, O
although O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
call O
it O
ideal O
yet. O

I O
couldn't O
wait O
for O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
at O
the O
concert, O
probably O
because O
of O
the O
great O
commotion O
around O
the O
place. O

Of O
course, O
I O
can't O
help O
mentioning O
the O
beer, B-TARGET
which O
I O
would O
have O
given O
a O
separate O
scale O
of O
11...out O
of O
10, O
which O
is O
more O
than O
excellent. O

And O
the O
prices O
for O
an O
institution B-TARGET
of O
such O
level O
can't O
help O
pleasing O
- O
genuine O
beer B-TARGET
from O
100 O
rubles. O

In O
general, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
a O
HUGE O
THANK O
YOU O
to O
the O
administration! B-TARGET

Keep O
it O
up:) O

At O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
restaurant O
you O
are O
welcomed O
by O
an O
unusual O
interior, B-TARGET
security O
guard O
and O
friendly O
administrator. B-TARGET

You O
go O
to O
one O
of O
the O
four O
rooms O
and O
then O
as O
usually: O
you O
have O
a O
seat, O
wait O
for O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
(thank O
God O
he O
comes O
quickly O
enough), O
order O
food O
and O
wait O
for O
15-20 O
minutes. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
quite O
interesting. O

If O
we O
take O
into O
consideration O
the O
cuisine, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
tasty O
in O
general, O
but O
it O
all O
depends, O
probably, O
on O
the O
chef O
or O
his O
mood, O
the O
kachestva O
of O
the O
products O
themselves O
or O
something O
else, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
... O
In O
general O
having O
been O
in O
the O
given O
restaurant O
some O
times O
and O
ordering O
the O
same O
hot O
meal O
I O
was O
very O
much O
disappointed, O
therefore O
the O
first O
time O
to O
me O
have O
brought O
a O
smart O
meat B-TARGET
dish, I-TARGET
but O
the O
second O
time O
I, O
to O
put O
it O
mildly, O
very O
much O
regret O
having O
ordered O
it: O
meat B-TARGET
rigid, O
not O
chewed, O
the O
knife O
cuts O
badly, O
and O
even O
hardly O
warm O
... O
horrible. O

But O
in O
general O
not O
a O
bad O
place. B-TARGET

Who O
hasn't O
been O
there O
yet, O
I O
recommend O
you O
give O
it O
a O
try. O

Went O
to O
Nelson O
Pub O
last O
week O
with O
my O
friends O
for O
a O
beer O
and O
we O
were O
astonished O
by O
the O
welcoming O
staff, B-TARGET
we O
have O
never O
seen O
such O
friendly O
people! O

We O
were O
served O
by O
waitress B-TARGET
Eugenia, O
we O
know O
her O
from O
another O
restaurant, O
very O
nice O
and O
kind O
girl, B-TARGET
always O
advises O
what O
to O
eat O
and O
what O
to O
drink. O

We O
had O
a O
beer B-TARGET
there O
and O
we O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
it O
was O
fresh. O

Pasta B-TARGET
was O
so O
good O
that O
we O
were O
ready O
to O
order O
a O
second O
helping, O
but O
couldn't O
because O
Nelson O
Pub O
has O
a O
great O
and O
tasty O
meal. B-TARGET

We O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
very O
much. O

In O
general O
we O
liked O
everything. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
tasty, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
100%, O
and O
I O
would O
ask O
the O
staff B-TARGET
to O
always O
be O
so O
nice O
and O
cheerful. O

I O
advise O
everybody O
to O
visit O
Nelson B-TARGET
Pub I-TARGET
and O
get O
only O
good O
emotions! O

Good O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
good O
service. B-TARGET

Were O
there O
twice. O

Went O
there O
twice O
and O
was O
very O
well O
received O
by O
both O
of O
us. O

Good O
interior B-TARGET
in O
an O
Italian O
style, O
polite O
and O
attentive O
waiters, B-TARGET
nice O
music B-TARGET
without O
the O
booms. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
though O
some O
dishes B-TARGET
weren't O
cooked O
according O
to O
the O
rules. O

And O
most O
importantly O
- O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

When O
we O
were O
in O
the O
restaurant O
both O
times O
there O
were O
only O
2 O
or O
3 O
tables O
set O
up O
in O
parallel O
with O
us. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
good O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner. O

For O
the O
price: O
dinner O
for O
two O
people O
costs O
about O
2000 O
rubles. O

As O
promised O
I O
will O
leave O
my O
review O
about O
you!:) O
July O
13, O
2014 O
was O
my O
brother's O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant! O

Everything O
was O
very O
nice: O
beautifully O
decorated O
hall, B-TARGET
cozy O
interior, B-TARGET
friendly O
staff)))) B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
at O
a O
very O
high O
level! O

I O
haven't O
seen O
it O
anywhere O
before. O
The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
were O
very O
attentive, O
the O
table O
was O
always O
clean O
and O
you O
did O
not O
even O
have O
to O
pour O
yourself O
anything! O

I O
would O
especially O
like O
to O
mention O
our O
waiter B-TARGET
Jelena, O
who O
was O
waiting O
on O
the O
bride O
and O
groom's O
table O
- O
I O
don't O
know O
her O
last O
name O
unfortunately! O
)))) O

And O
I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
say O
that O
I O
have O
never O
left O
reviews O
before O
and O
I O
thought O
that O
most O
of O
the O
positive O
reviews O
are O
written O
by O
the O
staff O
of O
the O
place, O
but O
it's O
just O
difficult O
not O
to O
write O
when O
such O
nice O
and O
friendly O
people O
are O
trying O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
your O
holiday!) O

Thank O
you O
so O
much!!! O
)))))))))))))) O

Celebrated O
my O
birthday. O

Just O
like O
3 O
years O
ago, O
nothing O
new O
on O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
just O
pizzas O
and O
pastas. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
new O
dishes O
should O
be O
added O
to O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at O
least O
once O
a O
year O
to O
keep O
people O
interested O
in O
trying O
something O
new. O

All O
the O
tables O
next O
to O
us O
were O
booked O
and O
there O
were O
celebrating O
something O
everywhere. O

Eat O
only O
pizza, B-TARGET
pasta B-TARGET
and O
salads B-TARGET
exactly O
the O
same O
(there O
are O
8 O
pieces O
and O
they O
are O
all O
made O
of O
vegetables B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mozzarella) I-TARGET
- O
I O
personally O
was O
embarrassed O
in O
front O
of O
my O
friends O
that O
I O
brought O
them O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
because O
really O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

If O
we O
look O
at O
this O
place O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
coming O
to O
eat O
- O
a O
good O
place, B-TARGET
a O
real O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
and O
not O
expensive. O

In O
general, O
the O
institution B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
owner B-TARGET
is O
talented, O
made O
both O
cafe O
and O
restaurant O
together O
and O
since O
the O
opening O
crowds O
gathered O
here. O

I O
wish O
that O
my O
feedback O
will O
reach O
the O
administration O
and O
they O
will O
start O
to O
diversify O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
meat O
dishes, O
side O
dishes, O
interesting O
salads O
and O
soups. O

Good O
day! O

I O
went O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
on O
December O
22. O

In O
general O
she O
likes O
more O
Chinese O
food O
and O
constantly O
drags O
me O
to O
all O
sorts O
of O
Chinese O
restaurants, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
really O
share O
her O
enthusiasm O
about O
Chinese O
delicacies. O

Some O
dishes, O
it O
is O
better O
not O
to O
know O
how O
and O
what O
to O
cook))) O

Well, O
here O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
the O
chief O
invited O
her O
to O
the O
cottage. O

Very O
nice O
time O
spent O
- O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
beautifully O
decorated O
room. B-TARGET

Immediately O
after O
we O
went O
in, O
we O
were O
approached O
by O
a O
waiter. B-TARGET

I O
don't O
like O
it O
when O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
and O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
to O
be O
noticed, O
but O
here O
everything O
was O
just O
the O
opposite O
- O
very O
fast O
and O
polite. O

We O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
for O
our O
order. O

I O
will O
definitely O
bring O
my O
girlfriend O
to O
you O
next O
time. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
in O
the O
restaurant O
"Kirochny O
Dvor". O

I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
a O
huge O
thank O
you O
to O
all O
the O
staff O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
had O
47 O
guests O
with O
us, O
the O
room B-TARGET
was O
free O
and O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
room B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
dance. I-TARGET

Administrators B-TARGET
helped O
us O
with O
decorating O
the O
hall O
and O
finding O
hosts O
(for O
which O
also O
many O
thanks). O

The O
menu O
was O
chosen O
for O
1800, O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
bring O
our O
own O
alcohol. O

Everything O
was O
very O
delicious, O
a O
wide O
range B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
large O
portions, B-TARGET
and O
most O
importantly O
the O
guests O
were O
satiated O
and O
happy. O

In O
general, O
everything O
went O
on O
5+. O

We O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
you O
to O
anyone O
we O
know. O

Thanks O
again! O

Anna O
and O
Ivan. O

Cuisine B-TARGET
- O
10 O
excellent, O
everything O
was O
delicious. O

Interior B-TARGET

wonderful, O
cozy. O

Service B-TARGET
- O
6. O

We O
booked O
a O
table O
the O
day O
before O
our O
visit. O

I O
wanted O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
birthday O
party. O

I've O
been O
to O
Mango B-TARGET
twice, O
that's O
why O
I O
chose O
this O
place. O

I O
specially O
stipulated O
that O
the O
table O
should O
be O
by O
the O
wall O
with O
a O
sofa. O

And O
when O
we O
came O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
didn't O
know O
anything O
about O
this O
reservation. O

The B-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
wasn't O
there. O

Tables B-TARGET
near O
the O
walls O
with O
sofas O
are O
all O
taken. O

Disappointing. O

So O
much O
for O
DR. O

We O
were O
offered O
to O
sit O
at O
any O
table O
and O
move O
when O
free. O

So O
we O
did. O

On O
the O
whole, O
the O
evening O
was O
not O
bad! O

Everything O
we O
ordered O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
was O
delicious! O

Everything O
was O
on O
time. O

We O
were O
given O
a O
discount O
as O
a O
birthday O
guest O
and O
a O
present O
- O
a O
jug O
of O
our O
own O
lemonade. O

Also O
delicious. O

In O
general O
they O
did O
everything O
to O
make O
us O
happy. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
were O
very O
good. O

That's O
why O
we O
didn't O
have O
the O
lowest O
price O
for O
the O
service.) B-TARGET

I O
do O
not O
know O
who O
is O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
hall O
staff B-TARGET
do O
not O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
reservation. O

But O
if O
the O
manager B-TARGET
goes O
somewhere, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
he O
should O
definitely O
leave O
information O
about O
the O
booked O
tables O
to O
someone! O

Good O
morning! O
Yesterday O
we O
were O
in O
a O
restaurant, O
though O
on O
Akademicheskaya! O

Really O
wanted O
to O
say O
thanks! O

I O
advise O
everybody! O
We O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance, O
and O
we O
wanted O
a O
specific O
one. O

There O
were O
no O
problems O
at O
all. O
We O
came O
in O
10 O
minutes O
before O
the O
appointed O
time O
and O
the O
table O
was O
ready. O

The B-TARGET
administrator I-TARGET
was O
very O
polite O
and O
smiling O
and O
showed O
us O
the O
menu. O

In O
less O
than O
a O
minute, O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
came. O

Unfortunately, O
I O
can't O
remember O
his O
name. O

But O
thank O
you O
very O
much! O

He O
is O
unobtrusive, O
always O
in O
sight, O
guesses O
your O
needs, O
has O
a O
sense O
of O
humour. O

The O
food O
was O
brought O
very O
quickly, O
to O
any O
question O
about O
the O
menu, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
replied O
without O
hesitation, O
very O
professional. O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
but O
you O
can O
barely O
hear O
the O
people O
at O
the O
neighbouring O
tables. O

The O
layout B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
well O
thought O
out O
and O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice O
and O
muffled. O

We O
were O
completely O
delighted. O

Three O
hours O
flew O
by O
in O
the O
same O
breath. O

You O
can O
go O
there, O
but O
you'd O
better O
make O
a O
reservation, O
especially O
for O
the O
evening. O

The O
prices O
are O
reasonable: O
we O
paid O
2200 O
for O
a O
large O
pizza B-TARGET
and O
6 O
cocktails. B-TARGET

Went O
to O
my O
birthday O
party O
at O
this O
restaurant! O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

Thanks O
a O
lot O
to O
waiter B-TARGET
Dmitry O
- O
very O
polite O
and O
cheerful! O

We O
ordered O
a O
Caesar B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
pasta, B-TARGET
and O
pizza, B-TARGET
and O
we O
loved O
it! O

We O
ordered O
a O
very O
tasty O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
and O
after O
we O
found O
out O
that O
it O
was O
my O
party, O
we O
got O
a O
fruit O
plate O
as O
a O
gift! O

I O
want O
to O
note O
the O
interior B-TARGET
- O
stylish, O
warm O
and O
cozy. O

We O
will O
visit O
more O
than O
once! O

I O
recommend O
it. O

Good O
day! O

We O
went O
there O
recently O
(November O
22). O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
parents. O

We O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
it. O

Pros: O
- O
Quite O
a O
pleasant O
interior, B-TARGET
soft O
lights, B-TARGET
soft O
music B-TARGET
(does O
not O
disturb O
the O
conversation). O

- O
Large O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
quite O
diverse. O

- O
We O
were O
served O
very O
quickly. O

Immediately O
we O
were O
served O
drinks, O
a O
little O
later O
brought O
salads O
and, O
before O
we O
had O
finished O
eating, O
as O
they O
began O
to O
serve O
hot O
food. O

And O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
served O
right O
away O
and O
was O
very O
chilled O
which O
was O
especially O
nice. O

- O
Very O
pleased O
with O
the O
food. B-TARGET

It O
was O
very O
tasty! O

We O
ordered O
quite O
a O
variety O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
liked O
absolutely O
everything! O

A B-TARGET
big O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
cooks! O

We O
ate O
a O
lot O
and O
enjoyed O
it))). O
- O
And O
of O
course, O
we O
were O
very O
surprised O
and O
happy O
with O
the O
food))). O

There O
were O
6 O
of O
us O
and O
we O
ordered O
salads, O
two O
kinds O
of O
dishes O
with O
eggplants, O
tofu, O
duck, O
fish, O
two O
kinds O
of O
meat, O
trifle O
and O
plus O
alcohol O
(in O
moderation) O
and O
it O
cost O
three O
and O
a O
penny. O

And O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
huge. O

We O
ate O
too O
much)) O

Cons: O
- O
Very O
much O
disliked O
that O
in O
the O
hall B-TARGET
smoking. O

And O
since O
the O
hall B-TARGET
is O
common, O
all O
my O
clothes O
stank O
as O
a O
result((. O

- O
Not O
really O
liked O
the O
restrooms. B-TARGET

Clean, O
but O
not O
neat. O

In O
general, O
the O
impression O
is O
very O
good. O

Of O
course O
we O
will O
come O
back O
again. O

Was O
in O
this O
place O
before O
and O
always O
noticed O
that O
the O
staff O
here O
a O
bit O
slow, O
but O
in O
general, O
no O
complaints, O
all O
were O
friendly O
to O
the O
present O
day.... O

I O
and O
my O
mom O
after O
the O
theater O
happy O
and O
contented, O
and O
for O
my O
own O
misfortune O
I O
decided O
to O
take O
her O
to O
the O
long B-TARGET
tail. I-TARGET

When O
we O
went O
in O
we O
were O
very O
nicely O
met O
and O
offered O
to O
take O
a O
seat O
on O
the O
first O
floor, O
not O
thinking O
long O
we O
sat O
down O
near O
the O
entrance O
next O
to O
the O
bar. O

I O
should O
point O
out O
that O
there O
were O
not O
too O
many O
people, O
which O
surprised O
me O
since O
it O
was O
Saturday, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
everyone O
is O
sitting O
upstairs, O
so O
it O
will O
be O
fast... O

After O
we O
sat O
down O
it O
took O
10 O
minutes O
and O
the O
menu O
was O
transferred O
to O
us O
which O
made O
my O
mom O
very O
happy. O
We O
quickly O
chose O
what O
to O
eat O
and O
waited O
for O
the O
waiter, O
at O
the O
entrance O
was O
a O
hostess B-TARGET
who O
was O
talking O
very O
nicely O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
her O
girlfriend, O
all O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
running O
past O
us, O
to O
our O
timid O
words, O
girl/young O
man, O
can O
I O
see O
you? O

We O
were O
answered O
by O
blatant O
ignoring, O
after O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting, O
we O
just O
got O
up O
and O
left, O
my O
mood O
was O
ruined, O
and O
so O
I O
wanted O
to O
please O
my O
mother O
!!!!. O

I O
assessed O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
place O
from O
past O
experience, O
I O
hope O
nothing O
has O
changed. O

But O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

So O
40 O
minutes O
of O
time O
wasted O
and O
no O
result. O

Never O
wrote O
reviews, O
but O
here O
- O
just O
have O
to! O

I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
eat O
with O
friends O
in O
the O
north, O
which O
would O
be O
cozy, O
not O
too O
noisy O
like O
in O
popular O
bars O
and O
cafes, O
but O
not O
a O
restaurant, O
in O
general O
a O
decent O
pub O
for O
a O
good O
drink O
and O
snacks. O

And O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
just O
that! O

And O
even O
better. O

To O
tell O
the O
truth, O
I O
consider O
the O
very O
fact O
that O
we O
managed O
to O
sit O
in O
this O
place B-TARGET
as O
luck O
- O
we O
saw O
a O
free O
table O
almost O
in O
the O
corner O
- O
just O
luck O
that O
it O
was O
free. O

So O
now O
we O
will O
make O
a O
reservation O
before O
we O
go O
here. O

Have O
not O
tried O
beer O
- O
so O
will O
not O
say O
anything. O

Have O
tried O
the O
cocktails B-TARGET
- O
great, O
feels O
like O
it O
was O
made O
from O
good O
drinks, B-TARGET
as O
it O
should O
be. O

A O
special O
thanks O
to O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
- O
she O
guessed O
our O
wishes O
and O
advised O
what O
we O
wanted. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
10 O
points. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

We O
should O
also O
mention O
a O
beautiful, O
cosy O
and O
stylish O
interior B-TARGET
and O
impeccably O
chosen O
background O
music B-TARGET
(for O
those O
who O
care). O

I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
at O
home, O
and O
everyone O
was O
with O
me. O

Thank O
you, O
"radio" B-TARGET
for O
a O
great O
evening! O

Today O
we O
went O
to O
Marcellis O
restaurant O
with O
our O
family. O

We O
were O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
we O
were O
satisfied, O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
exceeded O
our O
expectations, O
not O
everywhere O
meets O
as O
if O
we O
were O
visiting O
friends)))) O

We O
came O
to O
have O
a O
meal O
at O
about O
16 O
o'clock, O
we O
had O
a O
full O
house, O
we O
didn't O
order O
a O
table O
so O
we O
had O
to O
sit O
very O
close O
to O
the O
door O
but O
as O
we O
have O
small O
children O
we O
were O
worried O
that O
the O
children O
would O
wind O
up O
in O
the O
wind. O

The B-TARGET
receptionist I-TARGET
came O
into O
the O
situation, O
and O
immediately O
solved O
the O
problem O
(in O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
we O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
on O
couches O
and O
sofas) B-TARGET
and O
immediately O
took O
the O
order. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
in O
general O
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
homely, O
dirty O
dishes O
disappeared O
from O
the O
table O
unnoticed, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
pleasant O
and O
smiling O
guys. O

I O
liked O
halibut B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
and O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
tender O
halibut B-TARGET
or O
a O
salad B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
roasted I-TARGET
vegetables)) I-TARGET
in O
general O
we O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
everything, O
we O
left O
satisfied O
and O
full. O

And O
also, O
we O
did O
not O
order O
desserts, O
because O
our O
dinner O
was O
rather O
rich, O
but O
we O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
were O
treated O
with O
desserts O
in O
little O
glasses O
(panakota B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion). O

Now O
we O
are O
frequent O
guests O
at O
this O
place B-TARGET
and O
we O
will O
celebrate O
all O
family O
holidays O
in O
Marcellis. B-TARGET

Keep O
it O
up O
guys, O
thank O
you O
very O
much. O

anything O

We O
ordered O

The O

that O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful O
and O
comfortable O
and O
we O
liked O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

A O
special O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
chef O
of O
the O
restaurant O
for O
the O
beautiful O
and O
wonderful O
table. B-TARGET

Everything O
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
nicely O
decorated. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
friendly O
and O
smiling. O

Everything O
was O
on O
time O
and O
not O
intrusive. O

And O
we O
were O
given O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
tasty O
cake. B-TARGET

We O
invited O
our O
own O
host, O
as O
we O
agreed O
with O
him O
before O
choosing O
the O
restaurant. O

All O
the O
guests O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
evening O
spent. O

We O
all O
loved O
it, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
wonderful O
holiday. O

We O
will O
recommend O
you O
to O
all O
our O
friends O
and O
acquaintances. O

We O
wish O
you O
success O
and O
prosperity. O

Regards O
Maria O
and O
Konstantin. O

Sometimes O
I O
go O
there O
for O
a O
beer O
with O
my O
friends O
and O
my O
girlfriend. O

On O
Fridays O
and O
weekends, O
the O
place O
is O
always O
crowded O
and O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
small O
table B-TARGET
near O
a O
window, O
not O
very O
comfortable, O
but O
if O
you O
don't O
have O
a O
choice, O
it's O
okay. O

So O
if O
we're O
going O
out O
together, O
I O
reserve O
this O
table O
by O
the O
window O
because O
it's O
too O
expensive O
to O
order O
a O
regular O
table O
for O
3000 O
rubles. O
Usually O
our O
bill O
comes O
out O
to O
1 O
thousand O
rubles O
per O
person O
with O
beer O
and O
food. O

The O
beer B-TARGET
is O
tasty, O
as O
a O
rule O
I O
take O
Weinstein B-TARGET
pale I-TARGET
beer O
- O
already O
a O
classic, O
sometimes O
I O
try O
something O
new. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
tasty O
in O
general, O
no O
complaints, O
portions B-TARGET
are O
adequate. O

Service O
is O
sometimes O
poor, O
depends O
on O
the O
waitress, O
in O
my O
opinion O
waiter O
should O
always O
be O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
- O
and O
my O
rating O
depends O
on O
it. O

I O
think O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
should O
always O
be O
friendly O
and O
kind- O
this O
makes O
my O
appraisal O
more O
important. O

I O
like O
it O
so O
much O
there!!!!!!!!! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
trendy, O
modern, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
girls B-TARGET
are O
beautiful, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
amazing, O
whatever O
you O
order O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
delicious! O

the O

point O
your O
finger O
at O
the O
first O
dish O
and O
you O
can O
not O
go O
wrong! O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
always O
very O
good O
and O
decent, O
everyone O
was O
friendly O
and O
smiling! O

I O
only O
had O
one O
thing O
to O
say: O
we O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
on O
Saturday O
to O
have O
a O
bite O
to O
eat. O
The O
hostess B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice, O
it O
was O
late O
at O
night O
and O
almost O
all O
tables O
were O
taken O
or O
reserved, O
but O
she O
found O
us O
a O
very O
good O
place O
anyway. O

We O
were O
seated, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
brought O
the O
menu O
and O
left. O
We O
waited O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
until O
he O
came O
to O
us O
again O
and O
we O
ordered O
our O
order O
and O
it O
was O
in O
15 O
minutes, O
we O
were O
happy O
that O
the O
restaurant O
was O
fully O
loaded O
and O
everything O
was O
cooked O
fast O
and O
we O
really O
wanted O
to O
eat)) O

Empty O
plates O
for O
a O
long O
time O
did O
not O
take O
away, O
an O
empty O
cup O
of O
coffee O
in O
general O
did O
not O
notice, O
took O
away O
the O
plates, O
but O
left O
all O
the O
dirty O
utensils, O
then O
generally O
came O
to O
the O
table, O
took O
away O
the O
sugar O
bowl O
and O
put O
on O
the O
next O
table, O
the O
men O
were O
sitting O
there O
drinking O
tea, O
but O
nothing O
so O
that O
my O
friend O
drank O
coffee O
and O
she O
needed O
sugar! O

Well, O
in O
general, O
some O
strange, O
somewhere O
in O
the O
clouds O
flying)))) O

But O
we O
are O
not O
afraid O
of O
it, O
we O
went O
and O
will O
go O
to O
the O
marquee!!! B-TARGET

We O
had O
our O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Everything O
was O
just O
great! O

We O
were O
happy O
with O
the O
food, B-TARGET
decor B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

Thanks O
a O
lot O
to O
the O
administration B-TARGET
and O
restaurant B-TARGET
staff! I-TARGET

Always O
went O
to O
meet O
our O
wishes O
and O
everything O
was O
done O
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

The O
banquet O
menu O
was O
for O
4,000 O
rubles. O
- O
We O
ate O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
per O
person O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
(at O
least O
the O
hot B-TARGET
appetizers I-TARGET
and O
main B-TARGET
courses) O
was O
very O
good. O

I O
had O
a O
birthday O
party O
at O
the O
Paberty O
on O
the O
18th O
of O
October. O

I O
ordered O
a O
banquet O
for O
15 O
people. O

We O
chose O
the O
restaurant O
primarily O
because O
of O
its O
brewery B-TARGET
and, O
as O
it O
turned O
out, O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
had O
a O
discount O
card O
for O
this O
place O
:) O

The O
beer B-TARGET
really O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
amazing, O
just O
above O
all O
praises! O

First O
time O
I O
tasted O
freshly B-TARGET
brewed I-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
and O
now O
I O
guess O
I'll O
never O
be O
able O
to O
drink O
regular O
draft, O
and O
bottled O
beer O
all O
the O
more O
so O
:)) O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
really O
pleased O
us O
too! O

I O
ordered O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
- O
appetizers B-TARGET
and O
hot B-TARGET
dishes... O
I O
can't O
even O
single O
out O
something O
in O
particular. O
Everything O
turned O
out O
very O
tasty. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
several O
waiters B-TARGET
at O
a O
time O
so O
that O
the O
food O
and O
drinks O
were O
taken O
out O
very O
quickly, O
dirty O
dishes O
and O
ashtrays O
disappeared O
from O
the O
table O
quickly O
and O
were O
replaced O
by O
clean O
ones. O

Well O
done O
guys, O
for O
such O
service B-TARGET
it O
is O
worth O
leaving O
tips. O

We O
liked O
the O
entertainment B-TARGET
program I-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
too, O
we O
managed O
to O
dance O
as O
well, O
in O
short, O
it O
was O
fun O
:) O

To O
sum O
it O
up: O
the O
birthday O
party O
was O
on O
the O
Hooray, O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
very O
pleased, O
thanks O
a O
lot O
to O
the O
whole O
staff B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Paberti! I-TARGET

We O
went O
on O
Friday O
with O
my O
friends O
to O
"Moscow", O
they O
are O
our O
frequent O
guests O
there. O

Nice O
interior, B-TARGET
typical O
of O
Ginza, O
soft O
couches B-TARGET
and O
big O
tables, O
warm O
colors B-TARGET
and O
pretty O
girls.) B-TARGET

So O
everything O
has O
a O
pleasant O
pastime! O

Service B-TARGET
at O
a O
decent O
level! O

Sommelier B-TARGET
nice O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
unobtrusive O
helped O
in O
the O
choice, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
polite, O
she O
did O
her O
job O
perfectly!) O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
extremely O
delicious) O
the O
advertised O
shawarma B-TARGET
was O
just O
above O
all O
praise) O
I O
really O
wanted O
to O
eat O
it O
lately, O
but O
I O
was O
afraid O
to O
buy O
it O
in O
stalls O
near O
the O
subway, O
so O
I O
was O
satisfied O
with O
my O
choice))) O
The O
guys O
had O
a O
vegetable O
salad O
with O
crab O
and O
shrimp, O
beef O
steak O
with O
mashed O
potatoes O
- O
the O
salad B-TARGET
was O
great, O
the O
steak B-TARGET
was O
even O
better) O

And O
finally O
for O
dessert, B-TARGET
almond I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
.... O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
to O
put O
it O
into O
words, O
but O
I'm O
writing O
and O
licking O
my O
eyes!!!! O

It O
is O
unbelievably O
delicious, O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth, O
supreme O
delight!!! O

Taste O
MUST!!!! O
bottom O
line O
- O
I O
want O
more O
and O
more! O
)))) O

I've O
known O
this O
place O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
maybe O
two O
years. O

And O
so O
far O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
for O
me. O

Always O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
meat, B-TARGET
I O
always O
mention O
Abajur. B-TARGET

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
and O
in O
my O
head O
does O
not O
even O
think O
of O
another O
place O
if O
I O
want O
to O
eat O
meat. O

But O
even O
with O
the O
great O
food, B-TARGET
I O
would O
not O
go O
back O
if O
the O
interaction O
between O
waiter B-TARGET
and O
customer O
was O
not O
so O
cordial. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
know O
exactly O
what O
they O
are O
doing, O
they O
will O
tell O
you O
about O
all O
the O
dishes, O
give O
advice O
on O
what O
to O
choose, O
don't O
get O
stupid O
if O
you O
ask O
them O
about O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
dish. O

In O
fact, O
the O
main O
thing O
for O
me O
is O
that O
they're O
just O
nice O
people, B-TARGET
thank O
you O
guys. O

And O
just O
because O
of O
the O
human O
attitude O
of O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
I'm O
glad O
to O
just O
come O
in O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee O
in O
my O
free O
time. O

Cuisine B-TARGET
is O
pleased O
with O
everything, O
I O
really O
like O
everything, O
not O
for O
nothing O
I O
still O
consider O
this O
place B-TARGET
the O
best O
for O
me. O

But O
I O
will O
single O
out O
the O
duck B-TARGET
from O
the O
menu! O

You O
have O
to O
try O
it, O
it's O
inhumanly O
delicious! O
(I O
would O
be O
happy O
to O
see O
the O
chef O
and O
thank O
him). O

And O
of O
course O
take O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee! B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
lighting B-TARGET
is O
soft, O
the O
seats B-TARGET
are O
comfortable, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
good) O

What O
else O
can O
I O
add, O
I O
love O
Abazhur)) B-TARGET

Many O
thanks O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Imperia" I-TARGET
for O
a O
wonderful O
dinner! O

Everything O
was O
up O
to O
the O
mark: O
interesting O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
and O
in O
real O
life O
looks O
even O
better O
than O
on O
the O
photo O
(a O
lot O
of O
sculptures, B-TARGET
interesting O
lamps, B-TARGET
large O
soft O
couches), B-TARGET
polite O
and O
fast O
waiters, B-TARGET
soft O
music B-TARGET
(after O
20:00 O
live B-TARGET
performance I-TARGET
- O
it O
was O
interesting O
to O
listen O
to), O
and O
of O
course O
- O
very O
delicious O
food! B-TARGET

I O
would O
especially O
like O
to O
note O
the O
steaks B-TARGET
(they O
are O
above O
all O
praise) O
and O
dessert B-TARGET
(we O
tried O
Almond B-TARGET
- O
cooked O
in O
the O
restaurant O
itself, O
indescribably O
delicious)! O

As O
a O
result, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
recommend O
"Empire" B-TARGET
not O
only O
as O
a O
restaurant O
for O
weddings, O
birthdays O
(beautiful O
large O
halls, B-TARGET
comfortable O
dance B-TARGET
floor, I-TARGET
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
you O
will O
love), O
but O
also O
as O
a O
place O
with O
a O
cozy O
romantic O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
great O
Friday O
night! O

Be O
sure O
to O
visit O
you O
again! O

Great O
cafe B-TARGET
!!!! O

Celebrated O
my O
birthday O
there O
with O
friends. O

Everything O
was O
excellent O
- O
delicious O
and O
plentiful O
food, B-TARGET
great O
food, B-TARGET
great O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
polite O
receptionist B-TARGET
Alexandra. O

A O
small O
cozy O
cafe. B-TARGET

Very O
low O
prices O
(and O
this O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
place O
is O
on O
Nevsky O
Prospect). O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
I O
visited O
this O
place O
and O
I O
am O
always O
very O
satisfied. O

Very O
tasty O
khachapuri B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
tasty O
salmon B-TARGET
(a B-TARGET
piece I-TARGET
of O
very O
large O
and O
hearty). O

And O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

All O
my O
friends O
decided O
to O
come O
here O
again O
and O
again. O

On O
the O
minus O
side: O
There O
is O
probably O
only O
one O
minus: O
The O
decor B-TARGET
downstairs O
is O
not O
very O
nice. O

At O
least, O
I O
do O
not O
like O
it O
very O
much. O

But O
I O
guess O
this O
is O
for O
a O
fan. O

On O
the O
top B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
everything O
is O
super!!!! O

But O
downstairs O
you O
can O
sing O
karaoke! B-TARGET

There O
is O
a O
very O
tasty O
hookah. B-TARGET

In O
general, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
all O
those O
who O
want O
to O
have O
a O
tasty, O
hearty O
and O
not O
very O
expensive O
to O
celebrate O
any O
holiday O
or O
just O
sit O
together O
in O
a O
comfortable O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Very-very O
happy!!!! O

For O
the O
second O
time O
we O
celebrated O
a O
birthday O
in O
Palkin. O

Without O
booking O
a O
table O
in O
advance O
(we O
thought O
that O
there O
will O
definitely O
be O
a O
free O
table). O

Went O
up O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
there O
were O
free O
tables, O
but O
they O
were O
few. O

They O
were O
welcoming O
and O
we O
were O
given O
a O
big O
bouquet O
in O
a O
big O
vase. O

We O
were O
helped O
to O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
table. O

Bread O
offered O
a O
choice O
(later O
in O
the O
evening O
repeatedly O
approached O
the O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
and O
offered O
bread, O
"as O
you O
wish") O
and O
three O
kinds O
of O
butter. O

The O
evening O
at O
the O
restaurant O
Palkin O
passed O
in O
an O
elegant O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
created O
by O
polite O
and O
attentive O
staff. B-TARGET

The O
service O
was O
neat O
and O
unobtrusive, O
although O
there O
were O
many O
guests, O
both O
Russian O
and O
foreign. O

Meals O
at O
our O
table O
were O
served O
to O
the O
guests O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

Compliments B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
chef, O
salads, B-TARGET
appetizers, B-TARGET
and O
hot B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
were O
original O
and O
excellent. O

And O
what O
a O
show B-TARGET
we O
were O
shown O
by O
two O
young O
men O
who O
were O
busy O
preparing O
the O
ordered O
dessert, O
right O
in O
the O
hall O
in O
front O
of O
our O
table. O

Many O
thanks O
to O
the O
restaurant O
staff B-TARGET
for O
a O
wonderful O
evening. O

Had O
our O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant! O

The O
wedding O
was O
wonderful, O
the O
mood O
was O
ruined O
here! O

First O
things O
first, O
the O
banquet O
menu O
was O
2000 O
per O
person, O
it O
was O
not O
about O
the O
price, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
see O
a O
rich O
table, O
the O
receptionist O
assured O
us O
that O
it O
was O
enough, O
although O
we O
had O
a O
menu O
for O
18 O
people O
and O
two O
people O
could O
not O
come O
and O
the O
order O
was O
more O
than O
2000 O
per O
person O
and O
still O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
food! B-TARGET

It O
was O
ridiculous O
to O
look O
at O
6 O
little O
pieces O
of O
red B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
on O
a O
healthy O
dish, O
etc. O

I O
understand O
the O
beautiful O
tableware B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
decorations, I-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
make O
the O
guests O
laugh O
with O
6 O
rolls B-TARGET
on O
a O
huge O
plate! O

I'm O
saying O
nothing O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
take O
10% O
for O
service, B-TARGET
and O
we O
had O
only O
one O
waiter, B-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
alcohol O
on O
the O
table O
and O
he O
obviously O
didn't O
have O
time O
to O
serve O
it O
all, O
so O
the O
guests O
were O
sitting O
with O
empty O
glasses! O

He O
alone O
did O
not O
have O
time O
to O
serve O
hot O
food O
and O
dessert, O
as O
a O
result, O
the O
tea O
was O
already O
cold O
by O
the O
time O
dessert O
came! O

Recently O
we O
were O
at O
a O
wedding O
of O
friends. O
They O
had O
2000 O
per O
person O
without O
any O
service O
(tip O
optional) O
and O
the O
table O
was O
full O
of O
food O
and O
there O
was O
plenty O
left O
over! O

Maybe O
you O
can O
have O
a O
nice O
dinner O
here, O
but O
a O
banquet O
is O
definitely O
not O
worth O
it! O

Do O
not O
spoil O
your O
holiday! O

Good O
evening! O

Were O
at O
a O
friends O
wedding O
anniversary O
(10 O
years) O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

I O
registered O
specifically O
to O
leave O
a O
review O
about O
the O
banquet, O
because O
I O
liked O
it O
here O
very O
much! O

The O
hall B-TARGET
is O
very O
bright, O
cozy, O
there O
was O
a O
hotel O
area O
where O
we O
could O
sit O
and O
relax O
from O
the O
dancing. O

We O
danced O
the O
whole B-TARGET
night! I-TARGET

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
from O
my O
friends, O
they O
were O
advised O
both O
the O
host B-TARGET
and O
the O
musician, B-TARGET
it O
was O
great! O

Very O
cheerful, O
good O
music, B-TARGET
competitions B-TARGET
for O
both O
young O
people O
and O
adults! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
I O
especially O
liked O
the O
beef B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
and O
seafood B-TARGET
salad! I-TARGET

My O
wife O
loved O
it O
too. O

She O
had O
fish O
with O
some O
kind O
of O
white O
sauce O
and O
baked O
potatoes. O

In O
general O
the O
table B-TARGET
was O
set O
really O
posh. O

Big O
plates, B-TARGET
richly O
decorated, O
though O
the O
guys O
who O
ordered O
a O
banquet, O
said O
that O
the O
prices O
are O
moderate. O

Now O
I O
am O
preparing O
to O
celebrate O
my O
anniversary O
here O
also O
and O
my O
daughter O
is O
thinking O
about O
a O
wedding. O

Very O
good! O
Thank O
you O
very O
much! O

I O
want O
to O
say O
a O
huge O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
Bravo-Laudes I-TARGET
and O
a O
special O
thanks O
to O
the O
owner B-TARGET
Michael!!!!! O

Our O
wedding O
was O
on O
24.08.13, O
the O
restaurant O
was O
recommended O
to O
us O
by O
our O
friends. O

When O
we O
went O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time O
we O
immediately O
felt O
that O
this O
is O
the O
right O
place B-TARGET
for O
our O
wedding. O

Michael O
told O
us O
everything O
in O
detail O
and O
helped O
us O
to O
decide O
everything. O

We O
celebrated O
in O
the O
great B-TARGET
hall, I-TARGET
it O
was O
decorated O
just O
chic O
fountains B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
balloons, I-TARGET
the O
hearts O
dangled O
from O
the O
ceiling, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
in B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
tones, I-TARGET
and O
about O
our O
place O
I O
will O
say O
nothing O
about, O
lighting, B-TARGET
beautiful O
flowers B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
table, O
in O
general O
all O
decoration B-TARGET
was O
elegant, O
each O
chair B-TARGET
was O
decorated. O

Loaf O
and O
cake O
we O
ordered O
there, O
everything O
was O
brought O
to O
us. O

A O
buffet O
was O
ordered O
for O
the O
guests. O

As O
for O
the O
menu, O
we O
ordered O
2150 O
per O
person, O
there O
was O
such O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
food B-TARGET
that O
we O
still O
ate O
for O
three O
days. O

Our O
guests O
still O
remember O
that O
they O
have O
never O
eaten O
so O
delicious O
in O
their O
lives, O
and O
even O
after O
two O
days O
the O
salads B-TARGET
were O
fresh!!!!! O

And O
how O
they O
are O
decorated O
is O
beyond O
words!!!! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
great!!!!! O

They O
didn't O
notice O
anything, O
it O
was O
like O
they O
weren't O
there O
at O
all. O

In O
general, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
awesome, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
celebrate O
your O
wedding, O
I O
advise O
Bravo-Laudes B-TARGET
!!!!! O

You O
will O
not O
regret O
it!!! O

A O
nice O
Italian O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
no O
pretensions. O

From O
the O
minuses O
of O
service B-TARGET
is O
only O
that O
long O
waited O
for O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
with O
the O
menu. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
simple O
both O
inside O
and O
outside. O

We O
ordered O
tomato O
soup, O
risotto O
with O
porcini O
mushrooms, O
pasta O
with O
prawns O
and O
Caesar. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
large O
enough; O
everything O
was O
good, O
but O
the O
Caesar B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
was O
very O
disappointing, O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
unpalatable O
with O
a O
fishy O
smell. O

Good O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
tasty O
meal O
of O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
at O
a O
reasonable O
price. O

Went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
in O
April. O

Left O
a O
good O
impression. O

Started O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
went O
there O
on O
a O
Saturday, O
the O
room O
was O
full, O
there O
were O
no O
seats. O

We O
got O
upset. O

We O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
the O
bar O
with O
my O
girlfriend, O
waited O
for O
a O
mutual O
friend O
to O
decide O
where O
to O
go-where O
to O
go. O

We O
were O
waiting O
for O
about O
10 O
minutes O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
arrived O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
came O
out O
and O
politely O
offered O
us O
a O
reserved O
table, O
explaining O
that O
we O
can O
stay O
there O
until O
the O
"owners" O
(to O
our O
joy, O
they O
never O
showed O
up). O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
satisfactory, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
polite O
and O
brought O
the O
orders O
rather O
quickly. O

Prices O
are O
very O
reasonable, O
especially O
for O
beer. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
satisfying. O

We O
were O
pleased O
to O
hear O
there O
was O
a O
piano B-TARGET
standing O
in O
the O
corner O
and O
we O
could O
come O
over O
and O
play=) O

In O
general O
we O
were O
very O
pleased. O

We O
celebrated O
the O
anniversary O
of O
our O
girlfriend. O

Very O
pleased O
with O
it! O

Gorgeous O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
bay O
from O
the O
window, O
the O
blue O
and O
white O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
room O
creates O
a O
feeling O
of O
comfort O
and O
cleanliness. O

Lovely O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
cozy O
and O
warm O
(including O
in O
the O
shower!), O
excellent O
service B-TARGET
As O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
- O
delicious. O

Very O
good! O

The O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
reasonable. O

Live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
made O
me O
happy, O
we O
really O
liked O
the B-TARGET
singer I-TARGET
girl. I-TARGET

We O
danced O
and O
listened O
to O
music O
a O
lot. O

Had O
a O
great O
time, O
we O
will O
definitely O
go O
out O
and O
have O
fun. O

Thank O
you. O

We O
had O
dinner O
at O
Puri O
restaurant O
on O
06.09.2013. O

We O
chose O
it O
by O
location O
and O
based O
on O
people's O
reviews. O

Made O
a O
reservation O
by O
phone. O

Beautiful O
lady B-TARGET
receptionist I-TARGET
met O
us O
and O
took O
us O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
great. O

Interesting O
interior, B-TARGET
all O
colorful O
and O
very O
homely O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

We O
were O
really O
impressed O
by O
the O
service. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
Andrew O
was O
very O
good. O

He O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
with O
us, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
intrusive. O

He O
recommended O
an O
excellent O
tea, B-TARGET
which O
we O
were O
really O
happy O
about. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
very O
varied. O

They O
were O
quick O
to O
serve. O

Everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
tasty. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
friends O
and O
relatives. O

I O
have O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
visit O
other O
places O
in O
Ginza. O

Haven't O
been O
here O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
though O
it's O
close O
to O
me. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
there O
have O
clearly O
been O
changes O
for O
the O
better. O

At O
the O
entrance, O
there O
is O
a O
polite O
greeting O
and O
an O
offer O
of O
smoking O
and O
non-smoking O
rooms. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table O
of O
my O
choice, O
the O
menu O
was O
on O
the O
table, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
choose. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
just O
there. O

A O
pot O
of O
green O
tea O
with O
jasmine O
wasn't O
long O
in O
coming. O

They O
quickly O
got O
down O
to O
business. O

I O
ordered O
more O
rice O
with O
eel O
and O
a O
rainbow O
roll. O

Finished O
the O
first O
course, O
immediately O
brought O
the O
second. O

Great. O

As O
a O
novelty, O
my O
table O
was O
served O
not O
by O
one O
waiter, O
as O
it O
often O
is, O
but O
by O
a O
group O
of O
people O
who O
are O
less O
busy O
at O
the O
moment. O

This O
clearly O
increased O
the O
speed O
of O
food B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
and O
my O
mood. O

The O
checkout O
was O
also O
quick. O

Goodbye O
at O
the O
exit, O
they O
said. O

The O
desire O
to O
come O
here O
again O
appeared. O

Most O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
men, O
as O
they O
say O
this O
is O
a O
sushi O
chip O
to O
increase O
the O
speed O
of O
service. O

It O
works, O
really O
works. O

What O
else O
needs O
to O
work O
on O
is O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
it's O
not O
on O
the O
level O
of O
service B-TARGET
yet. O

I O
can O
not O
help O
but O
tell O
you O
how O
passed O
the O
banquet O
for O
my O
wedding. O

So, O
when O
we O
arrived O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
were O
ready, O
everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
as O
it O
should O
be. O

The B-TARGET
waitress, I-TARGET
everything O
was O
clear. O

The O
glasses O
were O
full, O
empty O
plates O
were O
removed O
on O
time. O

We O
ordered O
the O
second O
course O
from O
the O
menu. O

After O
ordering O
it O
took O
about O
half O
an O
hour, O
maybe O
more, O
when O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
came O
up O
to O
me O
and O
said O
there O
was O
no O
light O
in O
the O
kitchen O
and O
we O
had O
to O
make O
another O
order O
for O
a O
hot O
meal O
(on O
coals). O

After O
a O
wedding O
and O
a O
walk O
around O
town, O
as O
you O
can O
imagine, O
guests O
are O
always O
hungry. O

Yes, O
appetizers, O
somehow O
mitigated O
the O
desire O
to O
eat, O
but O
not O
so O
much O
as O
to O
wait O
another O
hour. O

There O
was O
nothing O
to O
do, O
everybody O
sat O
at O
the O
table O
again O
and O
began O
to O
choose O
other O
dishes. O
In O
20 O
minutes O
we O
ordered O
one O
more O
dish. O

And O
after O
30 O
minutes O
was O
quite O
funny, O
when O
the O
administrator O
came O
to O
me O
and O
said O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O
hot O
meal O
on O
coals. O

There O
will O
be O
the O
original O
order. O

There O
was O
nothing O
to O
spoil O
my O
mood O
that O
day. O

After O
15 O
minutes, O
our O
order O
was O
on O
the O
tables. O

Then O
I O
didn't O
care, O
the O
main O
thing O
was O
to O
feed O
our O
guests, O
and O
myself). O

Cake. O

Cake O
- O
ordered O
in O
advance O
(Napoleon) B-TARGET
did O
not O
meet O
my O
expectations, O
well, O
to O
taste O
and O
color O
is O
no O
friend. O

As O
for O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
it O
is O
very O
suitable O
for O
celebrations, O
managed O
to O
work O
with O
a O
photographer O
in O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
hall O
VIP. O

I O
recommend O
it O
but O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
cuisine O
needs O
to O
be O
ordered O
in O
advance O
and O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
try O
it! O

Good O
day! O

Yesterday O
in O
this O
place O
we O
had O
a O
birthday, O
anniversary. O

My O
family O
and O
I O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
time O
we O
spent O
there. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
tasty, O
has O
a O
good O
range O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
the O
price O
more O
than O
matches O
the O
quality. O

Very O
nice O
and O
discreet O
service. B-TARGET

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
we O
received O
a O
gift O
from O
the O
restaurant O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
large O
dish O
with O
fruit. O

I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
mention O
that O
despite O
the O
rather O
large O
number O
of O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant O
you O
do O
not O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
has O
the O
feeling O
of O
an O
authentic O
Italian O
restaurant. O

Good O
day! O

Were O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
two O
weeks O
ago O
in O
the O
restaurant O
"Olivier", O
but O
just O
now O
decided O
to O
write O
a O
review. O

So O
memories O
are O
a O
little O
blunted, O
but O
still O
want O
to O
share O
impressions!) O

We O
went O
there O
on O
Friday O
night O
and O
strangely O
enough O
there O
were O
not O
many O
people, O
which O
made O
us O
happy, O
because O
we O
had O
no O
problem O
to O
choose O
any O
table O
we O
liked. O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
friendly O
waiter B-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
immediately O
taken O
to O
a O
table O
and O
even O
exchanged O
a O
couple O
of O
jokes O
with O
him) O

Nice O
interior, B-TARGET
very O
much O
disposed O
to O
a O
pleasant O
conversation O
and O
a O
good O
time! O

Now O
for O
the O
best O
part, O
the O
food B-TARGET
...) O

It O
was O
delicious, O
very O
homemade O
and O
you O
know, O
you O
can O
even O
say O
cooked O
with O
love))) O

We O
ordered O
veal O
cutlets O
with O
mashed O
potatoes, O
khachapuri O
and O
two O
glasses O
of O
white O
wine. O

The O
cutlets B-TARGET
are O
very O
tender, O
mashed B-TARGET
potatoes O
was O
tasty O
but O
was O
a O
little O
warm, O
khachapuri B-TARGET
exceeded O
all O
expectations, O
were O
eaten O
in O
two O
minutes)))) O

In O
general O
we O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
it, O
I O
think O
that O
I O
will O
definitely O
go O
there O
again O
to O
try O
salad B-TARGET

I O
could O
not O
find O
the O
time O
to O
write O
a O
review O
about O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Very O
beautiful O

it. O

The O
table O
was O
bursting O
with O
dishes, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
decently O
decorated, O

the O
menu B-TARGET
cost O
a O
reasonable O
amount O

money, O

I O
had O
my O

Yes, O
I O
would O
especially O
like O
to O
mention O
the O
organization O
of O
my O

the O
work B-TARGET

the O

There O
was O
no O

You O

We O
had O
the O

spoke O
very O
highly O

is O
very O
interesting. O

The O
service B-TARGET
staff, I-TARGET
of O
course, O
ruined O
the O
whole O
holiday O
evening O
for O
us O
and O
our O
friends O
personally. O

Firstly, O
during O
service O
time O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
Anastasia O
dropped O
dirty O
dishes O
on O
the O
guest. O

Secondly, O
she O
constantly O
took O
away O
the O
dishes O
which O
still O
had O
food, O
and O
left O
the O
empty O
dishes O
on O
the O
table. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
she O
ordered O
water O
and O
brought O
it O
in O
20 O
minutes, O
saying O
that O
she O
had O
been O
eating O
all O
this O
time, O
she O
had O
no O
time. O

The O
men O
ordered O
themselves O
a O
bottle O
of O
Tequila, O
lemon O
and O
salt. O

All O
were O
brought O
separately, O
with O
a O
time O
difference O
of O
10 O
minutes. O

Which O
was O
very O
surprising. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
going O
to O
that O
restaurant. B-TARGET

There O
are O
much O
better O
restaurants O
in O
St. O
Petersburg. O

I'm O
a O
regular O
customer O
in O
the O
cafe. O

It O
was O
recently O
renovated O
and O
now O
it's O
nice O
and O
bright. O

I O
like O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
much. O
I O
often O
go O
there O
with O
my O
friends O
and O
celebrate O
parties O
(e.g. O
birthday O
parties). O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
always O
attentive O
to O
guests. O

I O
recommend O
this O
cafe B-TARGET
both O
for O
those O
who O
just O
want O
to O
drink O
coffee O
in O
a O
quiet O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
or O
any O
other O
celebration. O

We O
were O
there O
this O
Saturday. O

We O
were O
in O
a O
great O
mood O
but O
the O
atmosphere O
was O
about O
three-ish O
when O
we O
left. O

The O
best O
room B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant, O
made O
smoking. O

In O
other O
words O
you O
want O
to O
look O
at O
the O
Neva O
and O
the O
Hermitage, O
breathe O
the O
smoke. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
nice O
either. O

Either O
the O
same O
as O
in O
KhochuKharcho, O
Mamalygah, O
etc., O
or O
something O
of O
average O
level O
at O
a O
high O
price. O

We O
took: O
- O
cheburek B-TARGET
- O
the O
kid O
ate O
it, O
he O
was O
satisfied. O
- O
sea O
bass O
carpaccio B-TARGET
- O
so-so, O
not O
enough O
- O
the O
taste O
was O
strange O
- O
tuna B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
- O
so-so O
too, O
I O
regretted O
that O
I O
took O
it. O
- O
Lamb O
shish B-TARGET
kebab I-TARGET
- O
ok O
- O
grilled O
cheese O
- O
slightly O
warm O
- O
chocolate B-TARGET
casket I-TARGET
- O
the O
child O
liked O
it O
- O
coconut B-TARGET
shots I-TARGET
- O
tasty O
Service B-TARGET
was O
too O
obtrusive, O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
every O
2 O
minutes, O
and O
the O
table O
was O
not O
particularly O
watched. O

The O
staff O
were O
too O
helpful O
and O
didn't O
seem O
to O
be O
very O
attentive. O

I O
don't O
think O
we O
will O
use O
this O
place O
again. O

Conclusion O
I O
will O
write O
at O
once: O
friendly, O
tasty O
and O
cheerful. O

On O
Saturday O
night O
there O
were O
plenty O
of O
free O
seats O
to O
choose O
what O
you O
liked. O

There O
were O
comfortable O
sofas B-TARGET
and O
a O
round O
table O
for O
a O
big O
company. O

Waiter-bartender B-TARGET
is O
a O
highlight O
of O
the O
place)). O

The O
order O
was O
taken O
quickly, O
they O
brought O
it O
too. O

Lemonade, O
then O
salad, O
then O
steak, O
then O
coffee. O

Everything O
was O
on O
time, O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
sit O
over O
an O
empty O
plate. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
tasty, O
no O
remarks. O

The O
steak B-TARGET
was O
a O
steak, O
not O
a O
piece O
of O
fried O
meat. O

Good O
utensils, B-TARGET
new O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
a O
positive O
interior. B-TARGET

I O
want O
to O
spend O
more O
time O
there. O

The O
check O
was O
860 O
rubles. O
imho O
this O
is O
even O
cheap! O

Coffee O
was O
free! O

It's O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
so O
happy. O

I O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
for O
dessert, O
you O
should O
come O
here O
too, O
I O
highly O
recommend O
it! O

Today O
we O
happened O
to O
visit O
this O
restaurant. O

In O
general, O
makes O
quite O
a O
decent O
impression, O
but... O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
is O
disgusting. O

We O
spent O
10 O
minutes O
waiting O
for O
someone O
to O
come O
to O
us O
and O
bring O
us O
the O
menu. O

Then O
we O
spent O
15 O
minutes O
waiting O
for O
someone O
to O
come O
up O
and O
bring O
us O
the O
menu. O

When O
ordering O
we O
asked O
how O
long O
it O
would O
take O
to O
cook O
these O
or O
those O
dishes O
and O
at O
the O
end, O
since O
the O
time O
was O
short, O
we O
ordered O
caesar O
and O
morses O
for O
me O
and O
pasta, O
pancakes O
and O
morses O
for O
my O
husband. O

After O
30 O
minutes O
they O
brought O
me O
a O
salad O
and O
after O
another O
10 O
minutes O
they O
brought O
pancakes. O

When O
I O
asked O
about O
morsels O
and O
bread O
- O
another O
10 O
minutes O
passed O
and O
we O
received O
only O
morsels. O

Time O
was O
running O
out, O
there O
was O
no O
time O
for O
pasta, O
so O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
bill, O
which O
they O
brought O
immediately. O

We O
waited O
another O
10 O
minutes, O
when O
they O
will O
bring O
the O
pasta, O
but O
apparently O
it O
was O
not O
destined O
to O
eat O
it. O

We O
paid O
for O
everything O
(and O
pasta O
too) O
and O
left. O

From O
what O
we O
had O
time O
to O
try, O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
so O
that O
there O
are O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
something O
else. O

Go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
only O
if O
you O
have O
3-4 O
hours O
to O
spare, O
otherwise O
you O
won't O
get O
anywhere. O

We O
had O
only O
1.5 O
hours, O
but O
we O
couldn't O
eat O
everything O
we O
ordered O
unfortunately. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
in O
this O
restaurant! O

We O
didn't O
have O
anything O
to O
eat! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
fresh O
and O
delicious, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
friendly, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
very O
interesting, O
and O
we O
were O
especially O
impressed O
by O
the O
toilet B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
aquariums! I-TARGET

Very O
good O
location B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
city O
center, O
with O
beautiful O
views B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window! O

But O
at O
our O
party O
for O
the O
children O
we O
did O
not O
put O
the O
chairs, O
although O
the O
day O
before O
we O
talked O
about O
it O
and O
we O
were O
told O
that O
there O
were O
no O
problems O
put! O

In O
the O
end, O
one O
set O
with O
difficulty, O
and O
the O
second O
sat O
through O
the O
banquet O
on O
the O
arms O
(and O
then O
apparently O
they O
could O
not O
cope O
and O
left O
with O
a O
child O
before O
the O
hot O
meal O
(their O
hot O
meal O
for O
us O
by O
the O
way O
they O
did O
not O
bring) O
and O
some O
guests O
did O
not O
like O
that O
the O
food O
was O
put O
on O
the O
plates O
... O
since O
many O
people O
did O
not O
eat O
all O
... O

But O
these O
were O
the O
only O
faults O
of O
our O
celebration. O

In O
general, O
all O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
banquet! O

At O
the O
end O
we O
had O
everything O
wrapped O
up O
and O
gave O
us O
b/a O
drinks, O
no O
alcohol O
left... O

We O
came O
recently O
as O
a O
group, O
we O
hadn't O
been O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
it O
would O
be O
better O
if O
we O
hadn't O
come!!!!. O

It O
was O
Friday, O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
the O
hall, B-TARGET
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
only O
free O
table O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
were O
so O
close O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
out O
of O
there. O
(( O
But O
that O
wasn't O
the O
worst O
thing...)...... O

Very O
long O
bring O
your O
order O
or O
completely O
forget O
about O
you, O
all O
the O
time O
they O
come O
and O
ask O
again O
(well, O
if O
you O
have O
bad O
memory O
- O
take O
a O
paper O
and O
write O
down). O

We O
took O
a O
hot O
meal, O
salads, O
beer, O
and O
an O
appetizer O
for O
beer, O
which O
never O
waited, O
although O
after O
an O
hour O
once, O
even O
reminded, O
which O
we O
should O
not O
do O
in O
principle. O

But O
they O
didn't O
forget O
to O
include O
them O
in O
the O
bill!!!! O

The O
salads O
used O
to O
be O
tastier. O

The O
food O
is O
brought O
as O
hell, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
without O
any O
devices, O
all O
the O
time O
you O
have O
to O
remind, O
in O
the O
second, O
by O
time O
is O
terrible, O
1 O
of O
us O
has O
eaten O
an O
hour O
ago, O
and O
the O
second O
has O
not O
even O
apparently O
started O
to O
cook. O

You O
can't O
wait O
for O
the B-TARGET
waiter, I-TARGET
or O
before O
you O
finish O
eating O
your O
plate, O
they O
take O
it O
away. O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
in O
the O
hall B-TARGET
and O
you O
couldn't O
hear O
the O
music. B-TARGET

We O
used O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
with O
great O
pleasure, O
but O
now O
it O
is O
unclear. O

Never O
go O
there O
again!!!! O

Prices O

to O

very O
much!!!!17 O
July O
17 O

All, O
well O

polite O
waiters, B-TARGET
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
no O
conflicts O
and O
objections O

We O
decided O
to O
book O
your O
restaurant O
very O
fast! O

Plenty O
of O
room, B-TARGET
good O
menu, B-TARGET
and O
no O
need O
to O
decorate O
the O
hall B-TARGET
at O
all! O

When O
in O
other O
restaurants O
you O
have O
to O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
to O
close O
the O
horrible O
walls O
and O
make O
semblance O
of O
a O
holiday!) O

It's O
great O
that O
you O
have O
your O
own O
cake B-TARGET
shop, I-TARGET
the O
prices O
are O
the O
same, O
and O
the O
cake B-TARGET
was O
the O
tastiest!!! O

You O
don't O
have O
to O
order O
somewhere O
else, O
worry O
about O
delivery, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
cake O
would O
fall O
apart O
on O
the O
way! O

We O
never O
had O
to O
order O
anything, O
and O
the O
cake O
fell O
apart O
on O
the O
way! O
The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
friendly! O

Everything O
was O
just O
great! O

There O
was O
plenty O
of O
food O
and O
alcohol O
left O
over O
after O
the O
party! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
picked O
up O
everything O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
us, O
right O
down O
to O
our O
started O
bottles O
of O
wine! O

In O
normal O
restaurants O
with O
such O
you O
will O
seldom O
come O
across! O

Special O
thanks O
to O
Valentina!!! O

Very O
helpful O
with O
the O
menu O
and O
the O
wedding O
cake! O

In O
general, O
tell O
us O
what O
to O
do O
and O
how O
to O
do O
it O
better, O
take O
into O
account O
all O
preferences! O

We O
didn't O
worry O
about O
anything O
before O
or O
on O
the O
wedding O
day! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O
!!!! O

This O
is O
truly O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
weddings!!! O

Hooray-hooray-hooray!!! O

With O
best O
wishes, O
Andrew O
and O
Catherine O
Malashok!!! O

I've O
known O
this O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time, O
almost O
2 O
years O
- O
I've O
always O
been O
coming O
here O
on O
holidays, O
if O
I O
was O
near O
the O
park. O

A O
lot O
has O
changed O
lately O
- O
before O
it O
was O
just O
a O
quiet O
restaurant O
with O
good O
French O
cuisine, O
now O
they O
have O
become O
more O
active. O

We O
tried O
to O
celebrate O
the O
birthday O
of O
our O
daughter. O

Certainly O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
us, O
but O
I've O
always O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
and O
the O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

There O
is O
a O
menu B-TARGET
for O
children, O
room B-TARGET
and O
opportunity O
to O
have O
a O
good O
fun O
program. B-TARGET

The O
entertainers B-TARGET
were O
great O
and O
made O
the O
kids O
a O
real O
holiday. O

It O
was O
very O
nice. O

Another O
of O
my O
personal O
benefits O
was O
the O
lovely O
wine B-TARGET
selection. I-TARGET

I O
should O
have O
thanked O
them O
long O
ago. O

The O
price O
tag O
is O
better O
than O
average. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
twice. O

The O
first O
time O
was O
with O
a O
nice O
waiter B-TARGET
- O
everything O
was O
friendly O
and O
fast. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
Italian O
- O
if O
only O
by O
portion O
size. O

But O
it O
is O
edible. O

The O
second O
visit O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
very O
disappointing. O

We O
decided O
to O
check O
whether O
the O
business O
lunches O
were O
as O
good O
as O
it O
was O
said. O

Disappointment O
number O
one O
- O
you O
can O
order O
the O
business O
lunch O
only O
when O
sitting O
inside O
the O
room. O

Tables O
outside O
for O
some O
reason O
(???) O
are O
not O
designed O
for O
this. O

Well O
ok. O

Moved). O

It's O
hot O
indoors O
in O
the O
summer. O

Very. O

Since O
we O
were O
not O
on O
borini O
and O
lanzhin, O
then O
began O
to O
serve O
first O
those O
who O
have O
brought O
these O
delights O
to O
them.) O

Well, O
and O
you O
can't O
order O
one O
business O
lunch O
if O
you O
came O
alone O
(???). O

That O
is, O
when O
the O
other O
simply O
have O
no O
appetite O
or O
a O
portion O
for O
one O
very O
large? O

And O
all O
this O
was O
accompanied O
by O
an O
arrogant O
expression O
on O
the O
face O
of O
the O
waitress. B-TARGET

Conclusion. O

We O
used O
to O
recommend O
friends O
to O
visit O
this O
restaurant O
and O
wanted O
to O
become O
regulars O
ourselves. O

But O
now O
we O
can O
dissuade O
our O
friends O
from O
going O
there O
and O
not O
go O
ourselves. O

An O
ordinary O
soviet O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
an O
Italian O
name. O

Anyone O
who O
has O
ever O
been O
to O
Italy O
will O
understand. O

There O
are O
much O
better O
Italian O
restaurants O
with O
better O
service O
in O
St. O
Petersburg. O

And O
these O
guys O
still O
need O
to O
improve O
their O
game. O

Everything O
is O
decided O
by O
the O
people O
on O
the O
ground. O

And O
if O
the O
manager O
of O
the O
restaurant O
reads O
my O
review O
- O
let O
him O
take O
it O
into O
account.) O

A O
wish. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
in O
Belkanto O
on O
Malookhtinsky O
on O
05.07.2013. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
amazing! O

To O
say O
that O
we O
liked O
it O
- O
not O
to O
say O
anything!) O

We O
took O
the O
menu O
for O
1900, O
even O
though O
we O
ate O
a O
lot, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O

over O

packed O
it O

waiters, B-TARGET
great O
service! B-TARGET

We O
were O
afraid O
that O
there O
would O
be O
not O
enough O
space O
(there O
were O
46 O
people), O
but O
we O
were O
not O
overcrowded O
and O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
room B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
dancing.) I-TARGET

Nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
and O
all O
the O
guests O
enjoyed O
the O
time O
spent O
there. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much! O

I O
am O
amazed O
at O
what O
people O
have O
said O
about O
the O
good O
service. O

There O
were O
4 O
times O
of O
them O
only O
1 O
time O
they O
were O
served O
well: O
1 O
time O
they O
didn't O
give O
us O
the O
menu O
and O
it O
took O
them O
a O
long O
time O
to O
bring O
us O
drinks; O
2 O
times O
they O
didn't O
bring O
us O
the O
salad O
but O
they O
included O
it O
in O
the O
bill; O
3 O
times O
it O
was O
an O
epic O
fiasco O
- O
rude O
and O
careless O
attitude B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters... O

The O
menu O
is O
not O
on O
the O
table O
and O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
comes O
up O
and O
asks: O
"What O
did O
you O
choose?" O
Of O
what? O

After O
that, O
we O
were O
given O
a O
lunch O
menu O
(the O
regular O
menu O
is O
probably O
the O
only O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant). O

After O
that, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
left O
and O
never O
came O
to O
the O
table O
again. O
She O
waited O
for O
10 O
minutes O
and O
then O
called O
the O
other O
one. O

She O
took O
the O
order O
three O
minutes O
later. O

She O
brought O
another O
soup O
instead O
of O
the O
ordered O
one. O
After O
two O
minutes, O
she O
changed O
it. O

Drinks O
were O
served O
only O
after O
dessert O
(after O
my O
request O
to O
bring O
drinks!!!!). O

In O
a O
word, O
it O
was O
horrible! O

Yes O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
ketalon B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
is O
a O
miracle. O

But O
where O
do O
they O
get O
such O
waiters B-TARGET
??? O

Honestly, O
unpleasant O
impression, O
I O
thought O
everything O
had O
changed, O
but O
no=(. O

I O
want O
to O
share O
my O
review O
of O
the O
restaurant O
Duplex O
with O
all O
the O
users O
of O
this O
site. O

We O
chose O
this O
restaurant O
to O
celebrate O
the O
wedding O
feast O
with O
friends O
and O
relatives. O

We O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
beforehand, O
and O
we O
were O
able O
to O
assess O
the O
quality O
of O
food O
and O
see O
the O
interior. O

As O
the O
celebration O
was O
planned O
for O
25 O
people, O
there O
was O
enough O
space B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
our I-TARGET
guests, I-TARGET
and O
for O
dancing O
as O
well. O

The O
manager, B-TARGET
Alexey, O
who O
took O
our O
order O
and O
signed O
the O
contract, O
organized O
the O
entire O
event O
himself, O
and O
made O
us O
very O
happy. O

On O
the O
menu O
we O
chose O
a O
variety O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
they O
were O
all O
very O
delicious. O

The O
table B-TARGET
was O
rich O
and O
bright. O

We O
didn't O
have O
to O
decorate O
the O
hall, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
comfortable O
for O
a O
festive O
event. O

All O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
food, B-TARGET
service B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Thanks O
a O
lot O
to O
Alexey O
for O
our O
celebration! O

If O
I O
had O
to O
choose O
a O
restaurant O
second O
time, O
I O
did O
not O
hesitate O
and O
chose O
Duplex! B-TARGET

I O
really O
like O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

In O
a O
quiet O
place, B-TARGET
there O
is O
where O
to O
park O
the O
car, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy!) O

I O
go O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
to O
chat O
and O
eat O
a O
business O
lunch, O
and O
with O
my O
husband O
to O
eat O
good O
meat B-TARGET
and O
drink O
wine!) B-TARGET

Business B-TARGET
lunch I-TARGET
in O
comparison O
with O
other O
restaurants O
is O
not O
the O
cheapest, O
but O
the O
quality O
corresponds O
to O
the O
price O
completely! O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
not O
small O
and O
you O
can O
eat O
very O
well! O

Menu B-TARGET
options O
can O
also O
be O
chosen O
at O
will) O

We O
like O
to O
drink O
tea O
and O
we O
are O
glad O
that O
they O
always O
bring O
a O
compliment O
- O
2 O
cream O
buns O
(when O
you O
are O
not O
on O
a O
diet, O
you O
can), O
and O
before O
that O
there O
were O
2 O
versions O
of O
fruit O
puree... O

In O
the O
Lent, O
baked B-TARGET
apples I-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty! O

I O
tasted O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
ruccola I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimps: I-TARGET
tasty O
and O
original O
dressing!) B-TARGET

About O
service O
I O
can O
say O
separately, O
I O
like O
that O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
not O
minors O
but O
very O
nice O
and O
mature O
men!) B-TARGET

My O
favorite O
is O
Peter! O

He O
always O
takes O
care O
that O
we O
have O
a O
good O
meal O
and O
everything O
on O
the O
table O
was O
good! O

For O
this, O
his O
special O
thanks!) O

But O
other O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
good O
as O
well, O
they O
always O
make O
sure O
the O
table O
is O
clean, O
even O
if O
it's O
not O
his... O

So O
we O
are O
very O
happy O
with O
everything O
and O
come O
here O
often. O

Thank O
you O
for O
lovely O
and O
varied O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
customer B-TARGET
service. I-TARGET

Walked O
downtown O
with O
my O
sister, O
washed O
up O
from O
the O
heat O
on O
these O
beautiful O
rare O
warm O
days... O

Having O
worked O
up O
an O
appetite, O
we O
decided O
to O
stop O
by O
the O
restaurant O
for O
lunch. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
was O
going O
to O
visit O
a O
restaurant O
"Kuhnya", O
and O
it O
was O
not O
far O
from O
here. O

Already O
on O
the O
doorstep O
we O
felt O
the O
coolness O
of O
air B-TARGET
conditioning I-TARGET
and O
heard O
pleasant O
music, B-TARGET
we O
realized O
that O
we O
had O
made O
the O
right O
choice! O

The O
receptionist B-TARGET
girls I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
nice, O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
unobtrusive O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
comfortable O
tables B-TARGET
and O
clean O
and O
tasteful. O

Menu. O

Variety O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
competent O
waiters B-TARGET
will O
name O
ingredients O
and O
advise O
according O
to O
your O
eating O
habits. O

Had O
a O
wonderful O
lunch, O
quick, O
filling O
and O
most O
importantly O
- O
very O
tasty! O

As O
a O
real O
connoisseur O
of O
sweetness O
I O
was O
given O
the O
highest O
mark O
for O
it. O

You O
can O
really O
talk O
a O
lot O
about O
it, O
but O
maybe O
you O
should O
try O
it O
for O
yourself. O

I O
can O
safely O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
those O
who O
would O
like O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
enjoy O
good, O
well O
prepared O
meals. B-TARGET

It's O
always O
possible O
to O
find O
disadvantages O
no O
matter O
where O
you O
are, O
it O
all O
depends O
on O
our O
mood. O

Although O
in O
some O
places O
in O
our O
city O
they O
find O
themselves, O
these O
minuses O
... O

Here O
objectively O
- O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
. O

Work O
colleagues O
came O
the O
other O
day O
on O
a O
business O
trip O
and O
the O
four O
of O
us O
came O
to O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
Kamennoostrovsky. O

We O
ate O
quite O
a O
lot, O
really O
liked O
the O
food. B-TARGET

I O
personally O
ordered O
a O
salmon O
cutlets O
with O
mashed O
potatoes O
and O
a O
Canadian O
roll. O

In O
general, O
it O
was O
not O
my O
first O
visit O
to O
this O
place, O
and O
I O
have O
tried O
the O
meatballs B-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
there O
before, O
but O
this O
time O
they O
were O
cooked O
differently, O
tastier O
and O
juicier, O
as O
it O
seemed O
to O
me. O

The O
roll B-TARGET
was O
wonderful, O
the O
dishes O
from O
traditional O
chain O
establishments O
of O
Japanese O
cuisine O
in O
St. O
Petersburg O
could O
not O
stand O
the O
comparison)). O

Although, O
of O
course, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
this O
comparison O
is O
correct, O
in O
other O
places O
I O
have O
not O
eaten O
sushi O
so O
often. O

After O
a O
question O
to O
the O
waiter O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
chef O
had O
changed O
and O
the O
menu O
was O
changed. O

I O
was O
upset O
to O
hear O
that O
they O
would O
take O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
patties I-TARGET
out O
of O
the O
menu(. O

My O
colleagues O
also O
liked O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
very O
much. O

In O
particular O
the O
soup B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
two I-TARGET
fish, I-TARGET
salmon B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
and O
beef B-TARGET
stroganoff I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mashed O
potatoes. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
has O
changed O
too, O
but O
not O
really O
changed O
its O
style, O
service, B-TARGET
as O
before O
remained O
at O
a O
fairly O
good O
level, O
in O
general, O
we O
were O
pleased, O
thank O
you! O

I O
know O
that O
reviews O
often O
look O
administrators O
posted O
restaurants, O
a O
very O
big O
request O
to O
you, O
please O
do O
not O
remove O
cutlets O
from O
the O
menu!!! O

Thank O
you!!! O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
interesting. O

It's O
just O
worth O
going O
to. O

But... O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
just O
a O
nightmare. O

The O
service O
is O
better O
in O
the O
last O
Soviet O
canteen. O

We O
came O
not O
very O
hungry, O
ordered O
a O
couple O
of O
dishes O
and O
tea. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
told O
us O
that O
the O
order O
should O
be O
1500 O
rubles. O
and O
if O
not, O
he O
won't O
even O
open O
the O
table. O

If O
there O
wasn't, O
then O
he O
wouldn't O
even O
open O
the O
table. O
The O
waiter O
said O
that O
there O
were O
25,000 O
rubles O
apiece O
of O
money O
left O
over O
and O
that O
in O
general... O

Frankly O
speaking, O
it O
was O
a O
very O
unpleasant O
experience. O

Of O
course O
we O
ordered O
cocktails O
but O
to O
be O
honest, O
with O
all O
the O
coolness O
of O
the O
entourage B-TARGET
we O
didn't O
want O
to O
go O
there O
again. O

And O
it's O
not O
the O
money, O
but O
the O
attitude. B-TARGET

If O
everything O
is O
so O
tough O
they O
would O
warn O
about O
the O
deposit. O

And O
a O
few O
words O
about O
the O
cuisine. O

Food, B-TARGET
rather O
tasty, O
but O
very O
small O
portions O
(as O
in O
general O
at O
us O
in O
restaurants O
in O
Russia O
for O
some O
reason). O

Very O
pleasant O
cozy O
place. B-TARGET

A O
good O
price O
list O
for O
dishes. B-TARGET

Interior B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
- O
9 O
points. O

Good O
location, B-TARGET
parking B-TARGET
available. O

I O
can't O
say O
I O
liked O
everything, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
very O
good O
ones. O

The O
only O
downside O
to O
this O
place O
is O
the O
amount O
of O
people O
on O
weekends O
and O
how O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
chefs B-TARGET
deal O
with O
it. O

Hopefully O
they O
will O
solve O
this O
problem O
of O
long O
wait B-TARGET
times O
but O
overall O
we O
really O
like O
this O
place B-TARGET
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
especially O
on O
weekdays!!!!) O

We O
had O
some O
friends O
visit O
us O
from O
Vilnius. O

A O
few O
days O
of O
the O
cultural O
program O
in O
our O
beautiful O
St. O
Petersburg. O

And O
so O
one O
day O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch O
at O
Adjabsandal O
restaurant. O

There O
were O
4 O
of O
us O
adults O
and O
3 O
children O
(4, O
6 O
and O
9 O
years O
old). O

This O
was O
our O
first O
time O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
loved O
it O
VERY O
much! O

There O
was O
no O
one O
at O
the O
restaurant O
when O
we O
entered, O
later O
2 O
more O
guests O
came. O

Nice O
interior B-TARGET
(everything O
as O
on O
the O
photo), O
probably O
even O
cozier O
in O
real O
life. O

We O
came O
to O
our O
guests O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
big O
table. O

We O
ordered: O
Kharcho, O
lagman, O
khinkali, O
chhirtma, O
dushbara, O
dolma, O
khachapuri O
Mingrelian-style O
(1 O
piece) O
- O
we O
all O
received O
a O
piece. O

All O
meals B-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty, O
cooked O
in O
a O
homemade O
way. O

You B-TARGET
should I-TARGET
give I-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
respect O
to O
the O
cook. O

The O
dish O
consists O
of O
4 O
khinkali B-TARGET
of O
good O
size, O
and O
after O
the O
salad O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
khachapuri O
I O
could O
hardly O
eat O
it. O

My O
husband O
also O
ordered O
khinkali B-TARGET
(after O
chihirtma) O
and O
said O
he O
could O
have O
had O
one O
portion O
for O
two. O

My O
friend O
ordered O
beer, O
kharcho O
and O
lagman B-TARGET
(as O
a O
result O
he O
did O
not O
finish O
part O
of O
the O
lagman, O
although O
he O
really O
likes O
to O
eat). O

So, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
of O
dishes O
are O
ok O
and O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
that O
everything O
is O
cooked O
really O
well. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
good, O
not O
very O
intrusive, O
but O
very O
good. O

I O
can O
recommend O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
wish O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
management I-TARGET
good O
luck O
in O
business O
and O
keep O
this O
level O
of O
quality O
food B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

I O
rarely O
write O
negative O
feedback, O
but O
in O
this O
case, O
I O
just O
think O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
principle. O

Came O
in O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
Sunday O
night. O

Let's O
just O
say O
I O
haven't O
had O
such O
a O
disgusting O
experience O
of O
visiting O
a O
restaurant/pub B-TARGET
in O
a O
long O
time. O

We O
were O
met O
and O
served O
by O
a O
very O
rude O
waitress. B-TARGET

Half O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
menu O
was O
not O
available. O

When O
asked O
why O
so O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
responded O
with O
a O
challenge, O
that O
yesterday O
we O
had O
everything, O
and O
today O
we O
ran O
out. O

I O
ordered O
cheese O
sticks. O

We O
waited O
for O
them, O
waited, O
wait, O
waitress B-TARGET
came O
and O
said O
that O
she O
dropped O
them O
on O
the O
floor, O
and O
that O
they O
were O
the O
last O
sticks O
and O
in O
general O
the O
sticks O
will O
not. O

I O
wanted O
to O
get O
up O
and O
leave, O
but O
since O
it's O
the O
only O
place O
where O
you O
can O
drink O
beer O
in O
the O
area, O
I O
had O
to O
stay. O

My O
friend O
ordered O
the O
shrimp B-TARGET
caesar I-TARGET
(there O
was O
no O
chicken), B-TARGET
which O
tasted O
and O
looked O
completely O
disgusting. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
polite O
and O
asked O
if O
we O
knew O
that O
they O
were O
open O
on O
Sunday O
until O
11 O
pm. O

To O
which O
we O
replied O
"now O
we O
know. O

So O
that's O
it. O

Go O
there O
and O
I O
advise O
against O
it, O
of O
course O
maybe O
on O
more O
crowded O
days O
they O
have O
more O
adequate O
staff O
and O
all O
the O
dishes O
are O
available, O
but O
something O
tells O
me O
that O
unlikely. O

Recently O
celebrated O
a O
birthday O
party O
for O
40 O
people, O
it O
was O
just O
unforgettable. O

There O
was O
a O
delicious O
pizza B-TARGET
and O
salads B-TARGET
as I-TARGET
an O
appetizer, O
a O
large O
choice O
of O
main B-TARGET
courses O
to O
suit O
all O
tastes, O
all O
guests O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
cooking O
and O
very O
tasty O
dishes. B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
a O
big O
tiramisu B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
for O
dessert O
which O
we O
made O
ourselves O
- O
it O
was O
very O
tasty O
but O
we O
didn't O
have O
any O
more O
room O
in O
our O
stomach O
so O
we O
gave O
it O
to O
our O
guests O
back O
home. O

Quiet, O
pleasant O
music. B-TARGET

Very O
attentive O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
administrators. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
holiday O
and O
a O
very O
cordial O
atmosphere:)) O

I O
did O
not O
like O
the O
service B-TARGET
! O

Yesterday O
evening O
we O
ordered O
food O
and O
they O
brought O
it O
quickly O
but O
then O
they O
seemed O
to O
have O
forgotten O
about O
us. O
We O
finished O
our O
drinks O
and O
wanted O
to O
repeat O
them O
but O
no O
one O
came O
up O
to O
us O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
running O
around O
but O
they O
didn`t O
even O
look O
at O
us O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
tried O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
ourselves. O

By O
the O
way, O
there O
were O
very O
few O
tables O
in O
the O
hall..... O

Eventually O
I O
had O
to O
go O
over O
to O
the O
bar O
and O
call O
for O
someone. O

Then O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
drinks O
for O
about O
40 O
minutes, O
and O
when O
asked O
where O
our O
drinks, O
we O
were O
told: O
"Why, O
you O
have O
not O
brought O
them O
yet????". O

Surprised O
also O
that O
the O
guests O
in O
"Plyushkin" O
are O
not O
waved O
goodbye. O

The O
sharp O
contrast O
of O
poor O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
tasty O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
cozy O
interior B-TARGET
....!!!! O

There O
is O
a O
rather O
popular O
opinion O
about O
this O
place, O
I O
decided O
to O
check O
it O
out O
myself, O
as O
I O
live O
not O
far O
from O
it. O

I O
came O
in O
the O
afternoon O
to O
have O
lunch, O
was O
welcomed O
warmly O
enough, O
asked O
if O
I O
was O
the O
first O
time O
in O
the O
institution O
or O
already O
been O
here, O
it O
says O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
cares O
about O
their O
guests O
and O
remembers O
all O
the O
regulars). O

They O
helped O
me O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
table O
and O
told O
about O
all O
the O
promotions O
and O
offers. O

Particularly O
pleased O
50% O
discount O
on O
Japanese B-TARGET
menu.) I-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
fast O
and O
attentive, O
I O
liked O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
there O
was O
a O
big O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
food O
but O
I O
had O
tea O
only O
as O
I O
came O
for O
a O
lunch O
and O
I O
can't O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
drinks. O

I O
can't O
really O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
drinks. O
When O
I O
paid O
the O
bill O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
told O
me O
a O
lot O
about O
the O
programme O
for O
the O
weekend, O
the O
parties O
and O
the O
artists, O
I O
just O
couldn't O
refuse O
him O
and O
said O
I'd O
definitely O
come! O

In O
general, O
my O
impression O
of O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
quite O
positive O
and O
I O
plan O
to O
visit O
it O
often O
now. O

I O
wanted O
to O
write O
for O
a O
long O
time O
but O
didn't O
have O
time, O
I'm O
writing O
it O
now... O

We O
have O
been O
coming O
to O
'Khutor O
Vodograi' O
restaurant O
for O
several O
years. O

I O
always O
liked O
everything, O
food, O
service, O
atmosphere O
and O
mood O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

You O
could O
always O
feel O
Ukrainian O
coloring! O

However, O
our O
last O
visit O
made O
all O
the O
positive O
impressions O
disappear. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
came O
in O
the O
evening, O
no O
one O
met O
us, O
we O
stood O
at O
the O
entrance O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
sat O
down O
by O
ourselves, O
at O
a O
loss, O
and O
after O
10 O
minutes O
(!), O
someone O
in O
skinny O
jeans O
came O
up O
to O
us, O
gave O
us O
the O
menu O
and O
said: O
"- O
Wait O
for O
the O
waiter," O
as O
he O
himself O
could O
not O
help O
us O
in O
selecting O
drinks. O

I O
would O
very O
much O
like O
to O
ask O
the O
executives O
if O
they O
think O
this O
is O
acceptable, O
provided O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
of O
a O
high O
level!!! O

The O
horror O
of O
the O
evening O
continued! O

Then O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
to O
us O
and O
as O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
he O
did O
not O
even O
open O
the O
menu, O
unlike O
me O
who O
had O
studied O
it O
during O
20 O
minutes O
of O
waiting! O

We O
ordered O
and O
ate. O

We O
decided O
to O
take O
our O
favorite O
pastries, O
knowing O
that O
they O
were O
handmade, O
and O
somehow O
cheer O
ourselves O
up. O

And O
again O
a O
surprise! O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
they O
are O
no O
longer O
on O
the O
menu! B-TARGET

When O
asked O
"why?" O
the O
waiter O
said O
there O
was O
no O
one O
else O
who O
could O
make O
them. O

Unfortunately O
we O
still O
don't O
understand O
what's O
going O
on O
with O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET
It's O
a O
pity O
we O
didn't O
have O
the O
appropriate O
level, O
and O
we O
will O
have O
to O
look O
for O
a O
new O
favorite O
restaurant. O

Julia. O

I O
visited O
the O
cafe O
with O
my O
friend O
at O
lunch O
time. O

We O
are O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
prices. O

Ordered O
a O
pizza O
- O
very O
tasty, O
really O
great O
pizza. B-TARGET

A O
mint O
tea O
in O
a O
teapot, O
ice O
cream O
for O
dessert O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
red O
wine. O

Paid O
for O
about O
1000 O
roubles. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
is O
polite, O
quick, O
answers O
questions O
and O
makes O
no O
complaints. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
small O
and O
it O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
to O
put O
a O
few O
plates O
on O
them, O
and O
overall O
it's O
crowded O
inside. O
The O
tables B-TARGET
are O
close O
to O
each O
other, O
so O
that O
you O
can O
hear O
quite O
well O
what O
they O
say O
at O
the O
other O
table. O

To O
go O
to O
lunch O
is O
a O
good O
choice, O
to O
discuss O
something O
and O
sit O
quietly O
is O
not O
the O
best O
place. B-TARGET

I O
will O
come O
again O
and O
again O
because O
of O
the O
pizza! B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
specific, O
very O
Italian, O
my O
friend O
did O
not O
like O
it, O
so O
maybe O
not O
everyone O
will O
find O
it O
nice. O

But O
that's O
not O
as O
important O
as O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
decent O
service B-TARGET
:) O

I O
went O
to O
Jean-Jacques O
with O
a O
friend O
not O
so O
long O
ago, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
share O
my O
impressions. O

Usually O
we O
go O
to O
Nevsky O
166, O
but O
this O
time O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Marata O
Street O
for O
comparison. O

It O
was O
Friday O
evening, O
we O
had O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
not O
met, O
but O
walking O
a O
little O
further, O
closer O
to O
the O
bar, O
we O
saw O
the O
administrator O
who O
probably O
took O
our O
reservations O
and O
we O
were O
escorted O
to O
the O
table O
and O
offered O
drinks. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
young O
man. O

He O
even O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
conversation O
with O
him O
and O
advised O
us O
to O
have O
a O
fish O
and O
wine. O

As O
far O
as O
service O
is O
concerned O
we O
didn't O
feel O
that O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
pushy, O
but O
he O
wasn't O
neglected O
either. O

He O
made O
gestures O
or O
glances O
at O
us O
and O
knew O
that O
we O
needed O
his O
help O
and O
responded O
instantly. O

The O
kitchen... O

The O
kitchen! O

I O
have O
always O
loved O
the O
cooking O
here. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
juicy, O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and O
the O
bread B-TARGET
basket I-TARGET
was O
a O
delight!!! O

We O
always O
order O
one O
basket B-TARGET
and O
then O
order O
several O
more O
of O
each! O

Impossible O
to O
refuse O
it! O

As O
for O
the O
interior B-TARGET
everything O
is O
fine, O
but O
only O
one O
minus O
for O
me. O

Too O
crowded, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
located O
close O
to O
each O
other, O
you O
can O
hear O
the O
neighboring O
conversations O
and O
not O
only. O

To O
sum O
up, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
we O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
our O
visit! O

We O
look O
forward O
to O
seeing O
you O
again! O

Hello! O
On O
12.08.2014 O
we O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
in O
the O
restaurant O
"Favorit". O

We O
chose O
this O
place B-TARGET
because O
of O
its O
several O
qualities: O
excellent O
menu B-TARGET
(large O
selection), O
delicious O
pastries!!!, B-TARGET
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
good O
location B-TARGET
(subway O
close), O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
presence O
of O
natural O
light O
makes O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
even O
more O
comfortable, O
the O
price O
corresponds O
to O
the O
quality!!! O

We O
would O
like O
to O
say O
a O
HUGE O
thank O
you O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
!!!!!! O

We O
would O
like O
to O
express O
our O
special O
gratitude O
to O
our O
GREAT O
Banquet O
Manager B-TARGET
Anna O
who O
helped O
us O
very O
much: O
she O
told O
us O
about O
the O
cuisine O
and O
the O
restaurant, O
helped O
us O
to O
choose O
dishes, O
drinks, O
pastries O
and O
decorating O
the O
hall, O
she O
brought O
all O
the O
necessary O
information O
to O
us O
and O
organized O
our O
party O
in O
a O
superb O
way! O

We O
will O
be O
visiting O

and O
again!!! O

Thank O

27.04.2013 O
visited O
your O
restaurant O
Eurasia O
with O
my O
family O
in O
Lomonosov! O

Lomonosov! O

I O
liked O
everything! O

Service B-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level, O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
menus B-TARGET
and O
drinks), B-TARGET
a O
pleasant O
interior, B-TARGET
quiet, O
calm! O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Marina O
was O
polite O
and O
friendly, O
she O
took O
my O
order O
very O
quickly. O

The B-TARGET
guys I-TARGET
work O
as O
a O
team, O
all O
the O
time O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
helped O
the O
waiters. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much!) O

Good O
luck O
and O
prosperity O
to O
you! O

Good O
day O
to O
you O
all! O

Yesterday O
we O
had O
a O
rest O
with O
a O
group O
of O
9 O
people O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

What O
can O
I O
say, O
we O
had O
a O
purely O
Russian O
dinner O
at O
the O
Italian O
restaurant:) O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
comfortable O
enough, O
there O
are O
sofas. B-TARGET

There O
was O
nice O
music, B-TARGET
which O
was O
also O
nice. O

We O
ordered O
a O
lot O
of O
pasta O
dishes O
and O
my O
favorite O
was O
pasta O
with O
smoked O
breast. O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

The O
vegetable B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
also O
to O
my O
liking. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
was O
ok, O
but O
I O
can't O
say O
anything O
negative O
about O
it. O

The O
guys O
mostly O
ordered O
salmon B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
steaks, I-TARGET
and O
we O
could O
tell O
by O
the O
look O
on O
their O
happy O
faces O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
definitely O
tasty O
and O
satisfying. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
was O
missing O
was O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
chef. I-TARGET

We O
drank O
morsels, O
wine, O
vodka O
and O
beer. O

No O
surprises O
here, O
except O
that O
the O
assortment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beers I-TARGET
could O
be O
bigger, O
not O
as O
in O
pubs, O
but O
3-4 O
variants O
is O
good O
enough. O

I O
don't O
like O
imposing O
of O
Heineken. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
pleasant O
and O
relaxing. O

By O
the O
contingent O
you O
can O
understand O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
for O
those O
who O
are O
over O
30, O
for O
couples, O
just O
for O
lovers. O

But O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
won't O
be O
left O
out O
either. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
at O
an O
altitude, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
due O
to O
our O
stated O
ambitions O
for O
the O
volume O
of O
the O
order O
and O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
future O
tea, O
I O
do O
not O
know. O

But O
the O
girl B-TARGET
was O
very O
kind, O
attentive O
and O
just O
beautiful O
:) O

I O
think O
her O
name O
was O
Natasha.) O

I O
wish O
I O
had O
a O
phone O
number. O

In O
general, O
I O
advise O
her. O

I O
read O
the O
reviews O
on O
this O
site O
and O
decided O
to O
visit O
the O
place. O

In O
fact, O
everything O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
"on O
the O
level". O

I O
liked O
the O
beautiful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
polite, O
fairly O
fast O
service. B-TARGET

But O
most O
importantly O
- O
it O
was O
VERY O
tasty. O

I O
haven't O
been O
in O
a O
place O
I O
had O
almost O
no O
complaints O
about O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
with O
our O
friends O
and O
everyone O
was O
in O
a O
good O
mood. O

I O
will O
definitely O
go O
there O
again. O

Really O
lovely O
restaurant, B-TARGET
or O
rather O
a O
cafe. B-TARGET

Very O
cosy O
environment, B-TARGET
good O
staff B-TARGET
and O
nice O
interior. B-TARGET

Reminds O
of O
a O
kafeteria O
from O
a O
TV O
series O
"Friends", O
not O
by O
design O
but O
more O
cosiness, O
where O
it O
would O
be O
desirable O
to O
come O
in O
company O
or O
alone O
to O
sit O
quietly O
and O
read O
a O
book. O

Of O
the O
minuses O
- O
a O
noisy O
elevator B-TARGET
that O
takes O
food O
from O
the O
kitchen, O
which O
is O
on O
the O
first O
floor, O
although O
the O
idea O
is O
interesting. O

Well O
and O
for O
someone O
a O
minus, O
but O
for O
me O
a O
plus, O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
institution O
is O
against O
alcohol B-TARGET
and O
in O
his O
institutions O
it O
is O
not O
sold O
on O
principle. O

But O
if O
you O
order O
a O
banquet, O
you O
can O
come O
with O
your O
own, O
but O
on O
condition O
that O
you O
have O
receipts. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
it O
has O
been O
recently O
opened O
and O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
get O
better O
with O
time. O

An O
anniversary O
is O
the O
occasion O
when O
you O
want O
to O
get O
together O
only O
your O
own O
not O
large O
company O
in O
a O
cozy O
institution. O

I O
searched O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
as O
quite O
picky O
by O
nature O
and O
found O
this O
great O
cafe. B-TARGET

I O
found O
it O
all: O
interior, B-TARGET
tasty O
unusual O
dishes, B-TARGET
water O
on O
the O
table, O
which O
is O
especially O
nice O
and O
attentive, O
hospitable O
staff, B-TARGET
which O
is O
a O
rarity O
in O
our O
city. O

To O
say O
that O
everyone O
was O
happy O
with O
my O
choice O
is O
to O
say O
nothing. O

It's O
now O
our O
favourite. O

Thank O
you O
Mon B-TARGET
Petit I-TARGET
Cafe I-TARGET
for O
the O
feast. O

I O
had O
never O
written O
a O
review O
before, O
but O
I O
was O
overwhelmed O
with O
emotion. O

I O
had O
to O
register O
on O
purpose. O
On O
April O
13th O
we O
had O
a O
banquet O
in O
"Old O
Plovdiv". O

I O
can O
not O
avoid O
writing O
a O
review, O
because O
I O
am O
still O
impressed O
by O
my O
visit O
to O
this O
place. B-TARGET

There O
were O
people O
of O
different O
ages O
at O
the O
banquet O
and O
there O
wasn't O
a O
single O
person O
who O
didn't O
like O
anything. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful: O
the O
room B-TARGET
(we O
were O
sitting O
in O
the O
central B-TARGET
hall I-TARGET
on O
the O
second O
floor) O
and O
the O
food, B-TARGET
and O
the O
appearance B-TARGET
of O
the O
table. O

But O
most O
of O
all O
we O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
staff B-TARGET
- O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
who O
helped O
us O
to O
make O
an O
order, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
Maria, O
whose O
work B-TARGET
is O
above O
all O
praise. O

Greeting, O
smiling, O
everything O
was O
on O
time, O
asking O
if O
you O
like O
everything, O
advising O
on O
pre-orders. O

I O
have O
been O
in O
many O
restaurants, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
in O
this O
one O
- O
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
visit O
you O
again, O
and O
will O
recommend O
your O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
our O
friends. O

Hello! O

Regularly O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
friends! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
weekend O
in O
a O
company O
spiritually, O
fun, O
delicious, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
for O
it! O

Beautiful O
Margarita B-TARGET
, O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
great O
music B-TARGET
!!! O

I O
live O
in O
another O
area O
but O
gladly O
come O
here, O
may O
other O
Mexican O
restaurants O
forgive O
me, O
for O
the O
Mexican B-TARGET
food, I-TARGET
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
to O
have O
a O
great O
evening! O

Also O
nice O
that O
the O
kitchen O
is O
open O
long O
weekends O
unlike O
many O
other O
places! O

Overall, O
the O
place B-TARGET
has O
never O
let O
me O
down, O
I O
recommend O
it! O

On O
a O
recent, O
quite O
un-spring-like O
cold O
evenings O
I O
wanted O
warmth O
and O
comfort. O

I O
invited O
my O
girlfriend O
to O
AMARENA O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner! O

I O
had O
never O
been O
to O
the O
restaurant O
before, O
but O
I O
often O
passed O
by O
it. O

I O
had O
wanted O
to O
visit O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

The O
evening O
began O
to O
enjoy O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
got O
there O
quickly, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
quite O
conveniently O
located. O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
greeted O
and O
led O
to O
the O
table O
and O
handed O
the O
menu. O

Everything O
as O
it O
should O
be, O
with O
a O
sincere O
smile O
(I O
think O
it O
was O
the O
administrator). B-TARGET

Soon O
there O
was O
an O
equally O
friendly O
waiter B-TARGET
and O
asked O
if O
we O
were O
ready O
to O
order. O

While O
waiting O
for O
our O
food, O
we O
looked O
around. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
is O
very O
nicely O
decorated O
in O
warm O
colors. O

Bright O
furniture. O

It O
was O
very O
comfortable O
and O
cozy! O

For O
ourselves O
we O
thought O
that O
it O
would O
be O
perfect O
for O
celebrating O
large-scale O
events. O

We O
liked O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
much O
too!!!(special O
thanks O
to O
the O
cook O
for O
that!!!) O

The O
salmon O
melted O
in O
the O
mouth, O
Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
is O
beyond O
praise! O

My O
companion O
did O
not O
deny O
herself O
a O
dessert. O

I O
don't O
remember O
the O
name O
of O
it, O
but O
it O
looked O
very O
colorful O
and O
served B-TARGET
very O
nicely. O

All O
in O
all, O
had O
a O
very O
good O
evening! O
the O
girl O
liked O
it O
all O
too!!! O

Р. O

S. O
will O
come O
again O
and O
again) O

I O
had O
recently O
discovered O
this O
cafe B-TARGET
"On I-TARGET
Pairs". I-TARGET
Nowhere O
else O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
where O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
steamed. O

I O
follow O
my O
health, O
and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
that O
the O
steamed B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
can O
not O
only O
be O
healthy, O
but O
also O
very O
delicious. O

I O
try O
to O
try O
new O
dishes O
from O
the O
menu O
during O
every O
visit, O
especially O
I O
liked O
the O
chicken O
caesar, B-TARGET
salmon B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
sea O
buckthorn O
tea B-TARGET
and O
tiramisu B-TARGET
by O
the O
chef. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
with O
a O
friend, O
he O
ordered O
hookah. O

Overall, O
the O
guys O
are O
great O
hookah B-TARGET
made O
good, O
but O
it O
took O
them O
very O
long. O

Maybe O
the O
reason O
was O
the O
large O
number O
of O
visitors. O

The B-TARGET
atmosphere I-TARGET
of O
the O
cafe O
is O
favorable O
to O
rest-comfortable O
upholstered B-TARGET
furniture, I-TARGET
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
separated O
by O
curtains, O
but O
inside O
it O
is O
cool O
when O
you O
open O
and O
close O
the O
front O
door O
if O
you O
sit O
near O
the O
entrance. O

Despite O
all O
this, O
now O
it O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
places, B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
my O
friends. O

Celebrating O
its O
50 O
th O
anniversary. O

Two O
days O
in O
a O
row. O

Very O
much. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
favorable O
to O
a O
hearty O
feast O
with O
toasts, O
speeches O
and O
discussions O
(the O
room B-TARGET
is O
small, O
cozy O
and O
quiet). O

There O
was O
no O
need O
to O
reserve O
the O
entire O
room O
due O
to O
the O
small O
number O
of O
people O
visiting. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
surprises O
and O
pleases O
the O
eye, O
gives O
the O
opportunity O
to O
enjoy O
the O
paintings B-TARGET
of O
St. O
Petersburg O
artists. O

Cuisine: O
The B-TARGET
banquet I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
1800 O
rubles O
was O
satisfying O
with O
its O
variety, O
taste O
and O
quantity. O

Plus O
we O
were O
happy O
that O
we O
could O
bring O
our O
own O
alcohol O
and O
sweets O
though O
as O
we O
found O
out O
later O
the O
chef O
bakes O
really O
good O
cakes B-TARGET
which O
we O
unfortunately O
did O
not O
know O
about. O

We O
were O
worried O
about O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
wide O
choice O
of O
hot B-TARGET
dishes O
(red O
fish O
or O
beef), O
but O
the O
large O
portions B-TARGET
and O
delicacy O
of O
taste O
impressed O
us O
nicely. O

Two O
waiters O
served O
a O
company O
of O
14-20 O
people. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
at O
a O
high O
level O
(quiet, O
discreet, O
delicate). O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
the O
excess O
food, O
alcohol O
and O
juice O
were O
packed O
and O
given O
away. O

There O
is O
room B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
dancing I-TARGET
if O
desired O
. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
kindly O
allow O
any O
music O
to O
be O
put O
on. O

Looked O
for O
a O
long O
time O
for O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
and O
didn't O
miss O
it. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
small O
wooden O
floor O
and O
a O
dining O
room O
(there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
tables, O
cafes, O
bars, O
and O
other O
aromas O
to O
choose O
from). O

The O
cuisine O
is O
useless, O
some O
weird O
personnel O
in O
incomprehensible O
shape O
and O
service O
is O
also O
about O
nothing. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
really O
caught O
my O
eye O
was O
the O
design B-TARGET
of O
the O
cafe. O

Just O
the O
other O
day O
I O
decided O
to O
take O
a O
risk O
and O
came O
to O
have O
a O
rest. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
I O
decided O
to O
take O
a O
chance O
and O
go O
to O
rest. O

I O
even O
felt O
sorry O
for O
eating O
it. O
It O
was O
so O
beautifully O
decorated), O
not O
to O
mention O
that O
it O
was O
very O
tasty.) O

I O
liked O
unobtrusive O
and O
high O
quality O
service. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
we O
didn't O
even O
want O
to O
leave, O
everything O
was O
so O
warm O
and O
welcoming). O

It O
was O
a O
pleasant O
place B-TARGET
to O
stay. O

Really O
a O
lot O
of O
space, O
both O
in O
the O
halls B-TARGET
themselves, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
halls B-TARGET
and O
the O
checkroom. B-TARGET

Came O
in O
at O
three O
o'clock O
on O
a O
weekday O
- O
almost O
no O
one O
was O
there. O

Around O
all O
the O
quiet O
and O
peaceful. O

Administrator B-TARGET
showed O
the O
table, O
waiter B-TARGET
immediately O
came O
up O
and O
offered O
a O
menu. O

I O
ordered O
mushroom O
soup O
and O
vegetables O
and O
fish, O
and O
coffee O
in O
conclusion. O

I O
liked O
the O
taste O
of O
it O
all, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
good O
and O
I O
was O
stuffed. B-TARGET

The O
prices O
are O
average. O

I'll O
try O
to O
visit O
the O
performance O
some O
night O
- O
there's O
a O
big O
stage O
here O
for O
a O
reason! O

We O
celebrated O
my O
son's O
birthday O
in O
the O
restaurant O
last O
Sunday, O
March O
24. O

We O
had O
a O
long O
choice O
of O
place, O
because O
it's O
not O
an O
easy O
party O
for O
children: O
parents O
want O
to O
communicate, O
have O
a O
good O
meal O
and O
drink O
- O
we O
have O
our O
own O
party, O
and O
children O
want O
to O
play, O
play, O
and O
besides O
everyone O
is O
of O
different O
age. O

But O
it O
was O
not O
a O
mistake, O
we O
had O
a O
wonderful O
nursery, B-TARGET
great O
babysitter, B-TARGET
all O
the O
kids O
are O
doing O
something, O
they O
are O
modeling O
and O
making O
something, O
and O
we O
can't O
see O
or O
hear O
them! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
great, O
they O
did O
all O
the O
holiday O
planning. O

We O
came O
several O
times, O
looked O
around, O
chose O
a O
table, O
so O
they O
told O
us O
right O
away O
how O
and O
what O
to O
do, O
where O
to O
sit, O
what O
time O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
start O
the O
party, O
what O
snacks O
to O
put O
on O
the O
table. O

And O
when O
we O
came O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
feast, O
they O
even O
decorated O
our O
table O
with O
balloons! O
( O

No O
charge!) O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
large, O
with O
lots O
of O
people, O
but O
no O
one O
bothers O
anyone. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
tasty, O
the O
children O
loved O
the O
pizza, B-TARGET
my O
friends O
praised O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood, I-TARGET
my O
husband O
loved O
the O
pork B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
and O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
lasagna B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
it O
was O
delicious O
and O
nutritious. O

Though O
it O
was O
not O
cheap, O
but O
worth O
it. O

My O
head O
doesn't O
hurt, O
the O
kids O
are O
happy, O
and O
my O
friends O
liked O
it O
too. O

The O
holiday O
was O
a O
success! O

It's O
good O
that O
there O
is O
such O
a O
place B-TARGET
in O
our O
area. O

We O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
food. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
the O
chef O
for O
the O
excellent O
salads B-TARGET
and O
main B-TARGET
course. I-TARGET

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
large O
and O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
that O
they O
are O
yummy! O

We O
tried O
local B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
and O
enjoyed O
it. O

It's O
smooth O
and O
light. O

It's O
nice O
that O
the O
prices O
are O
not O
too O
high O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
on O
the O
level O
of O
5 O
points. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
pretty O
girls. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
guests O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

It's O
hard O
to O
park. O

All O
the O
tables O
were O
taken. O

We O
didn't O
expect O
that. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
original. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time, O
thanks O
for O
the O
welcome! O

Olyok O

I O
am O
surprised O
at O
the O
negative O
reviews O
of O
the O
institution, B-TARGET
because O
I O
personally O
was O
completely O

EVERYTHING: O

pluses O

special O
offer O
on O
alcohol B-TARGET
(you O

he O
answered O
all O
our O
questions O
about O
the O
food O
and O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
for O
our O
order. O

We O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
big O
and O
nicely O
decorated O
and O
everything O
is O
delicious. O

The O
food O
was O
well O
organised O
and O
the O
dining O
area B-TARGET
was O
good. O

Very O
tasty O
desserts: B-TARGET
tiramisu, B-TARGET
blueberry B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
and O
black B-TARGET
forest. I-TARGET

The O
prices O
with O
coupons O
were O
quite O
reasonable. O

With O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine, O
salads, O
hot O
food O
and O
desserts O
came O
out O
less O
than O
1000 O
rubles O
per O
person. O

My O
review O
Service: O
We O
booked O
the O
table O
and O
the O
food O
in O
advance, O
about O
three O
hours O
in O
advance. O

We O
arrived O
on O
time, O
sat O
at O
the O
table O
and O
..... O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
waiting O
for O
half O
an O
hour, O
she O
came O
running, O
put O
a O
bottle O
of O
vodka O
and O
left. O

I O
do O
not O
drink O
alcohol O
and O
that O
would O
order O
tea O
and O
lemonade O
for O
my O
daughter, O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bar O
and O
look O
for O
someone O
to O
take O
your O
order. O

They O
started O
to O
bring O
us O
crumbs O
of O
order, O
considering O
that O
we O
ordered O
in O
advance. O

I O
waited O
for O
dessert O
for O
another O
15 O
minutes O
after O
the O
meal. O

Checkroom: B-TARGET
I O
went O
out O
of O
the O
Oak O
Room O
three O
times O
and O
two O
of O
them O
I O
watched O
people O
leaving O
while O
they O
waited O
for O
clothes O
to O
be O
found. O

One O
lady O
even O
went O
in O
there O
to O
find O
her O
jacket O
Food: O
I O
went O
to O
another O
restaurant O
before, O
their O
menu O
is O
basically O
similar, O
interior O
too. O

At O
the O
Tea O
House O
I O
ate O
with O
difficulty, O
it O
didn't O
taste O
good. O

And O
I O
am O
a O
fan O
of O
Chinese O
food. O

I O
was O
really O
pleased O
with O
the O
dessert, O
it O
was O
really O
good, O
BUT O
if O
I O
had O
the O
same O
dessert O
at O
another O
restaurant O
for O
120 O
rubles, O
then O
here O
it O
was O
400, O
so, O
the O
difference O
was O
really O
noticeable. O

In O
general, O
it O
was O
just O
nerves O
and O
negativity O
from O
this O
place. B-TARGET
We O
didn't O
eat, O
but O
waited O
and O
remembered O
what O
was O
ordered O
there. O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
very O
poor, O
there O
was O
no O
smile O
from O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
no O
service. B-TARGET

I O
don't O
go O
there O
anymore. O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
four O
times O
since O
December O
last O
year. O

Lovely O
wine, B-TARGET
nice O
food B-TARGET
with O
nice O
presentation, B-TARGET
peaceful O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
great O
service. B-TARGET

Regarding O
ratings O
(1 O

10): O
- O
7 O
for O
food O
as O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
more O
variety O
in O
main B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
menu. O
- O
5 O
for O
interior B-TARGET
- O
not O
very O
cozy O
on O
these O
chairs, B-TARGET
bag O
anywhere O
not O
to O
put, O
the O
optimal O
place B-TARGET
near I-TARGET
the O
window O
(relatively O
comfortable) O
- O
10 O
for O
service B-TARGET
- O
always O
attentive O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
discreet O
staff, B-TARGET
which O
should O
be O
consistent O
with O
restaurant O
service. O

Had O
a O
birthday O
party O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
management B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
serving B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
to O
those O
chefs B-TARGET
who O
prepare O
such O
delicious B-TARGET
meals B-TARGET
for O
visitors O
to O
the O
place. O

I O
enjoyed O
it O
absolutely. O

Of O
course O
we O
were O
impressed O
by O
the O
interior: B-TARGET
it's O
nice O
and O
cozy. O

The O
table B-TARGET
was O
gorgeous. O

For O
a O
restaurant O
of O
such O
a O
high O
level O
the O
prices O
were O
not O
very O
high. O

I O
want O
to O
plunge O
back O
into O
the O
unforgettable O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

Just O
the O
other O
day O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
celebrated O
our O
little O
anniversary O
- O
2 O
years. O

We O
chose O
Makarena B-TARGET
for O
romantic O
evening O
and O
we O
are O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
choice! O

The O
menu O
was B-TARGET
excellent, O
we O
had O
so O
much O
stuff O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
come O
here O
more O
often O
to O
try O
different O
dishes. B-TARGET

Cocktails B-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty O
and O
not O
typical, O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
choose O
from. O

Had O
the O
salads O
of O
tongue O
and O
seafood O
and O
paella O
with O
chicken O
and O
rabbit. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
large O
and O
tasty O
and O
you O
can O
eat O
a O
lot! O

Great O
hookah, B-TARGET
we O
really O
enjoyed O
it, O
nice O
young O
guy O
hookah B-TARGET
guy, I-TARGET
friendly, O
helped O
us O
to O
choose O
the O
right O
one O
and O
didn't O
miss O
a O
thing! O

Nice O
interior, B-TARGET
we O
were O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
near O
the O
window. O

I O
liked O
the O
music, B-TARGET
it O
wasn't O
too O
loud O
as O
in O
many O
places, O
but O
creates O
a O
cosy O
and O
romantic O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Staff B-TARGET
are O
friendly, O
all O
smiling O
and O
always O
come O
up O
to O
clean O
the O
table, O
offered O
to O
make O
a B-TARGET
savings I-TARGET
discount, I-TARGET
which O
is O
very O
good! O

Thanks O
for O
the O
wonderful O
evening! O

Now O
we O
are O
your O
regular O
customers! O

I O
visited O
my O
friends O
in O
Moscow O
for O
New O
Year O
2013 O
and O
they O
took O
us O
to O
this O
place. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much: O
the O
food, B-TARGET
interior, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
check B-TARGET
for O
six O
people O
with O
alcohol O
pleased:) O

Very O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
but O
the O
area O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
small, O
which O
is O
a O
small O
minus, O
it O
may O
be O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O
empty O
seats! O

March O
8 O
Day O
has O
passed, O
it's O
time O
to O
sum O
up. O

I O
decided O
to O
write O
a O
review O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
which O
celebrated O
a O
wonderful O
spring O
holiday. O
After O
reading O
reviews O
edik077 O
and O
Rules77777 O
and O
realized O
that O
either O
we O
were O
in O
different O
restaurants O
or O
the O
guys O
something O
did O
not O
go O
well. O

But O
now O
about O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance O
and O
did O
as O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
has O
suggested O
i.e. O
have O
made O
the O
reservation, O
when O
having O
come O
have O
seen O
completely O
filled O
restaurant O
have O
understood O
that O
the O
advice O
to O
us O
has O
given O
really O
correct, O
in O
a O
restaurant O
there O
were O
people O
70-80, O
here O
really O
hot O
dish O
you O
can O
wait O
rather O
long. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
varied O
and O
very O
tasty, O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
liked O
everything O
that O
we O
were O
given, O
and O
we O
were O
given O
quite O
a O
few. O

The O
service O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
in O
town O
but O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
did O
what O
they O
needed. O

I O
must O
say O
that O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
all O
the O
same, O
not O
very O
long O
of O
course O
but O
still. O

Nice O
interior B-TARGET
and O
comfortable O
sofas. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
very O
good O
music B-TARGET
program I-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
funny O
host. B-TARGET

I O
was O
impressed O
with O
my O
choice O
and O
the O
way O
we O
spent O
the O
evening, O
nice O
restaurant, B-TARGET
cozy O
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Managements B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
THANK O
YOU. O

We O
visited O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant B-TARGET
late O
at O
night, O
close O
to O
midnight O
when O
no O
one O
else O
was O
really O
eating. O

Despite O
the O
bad O
weather, O
we O
tried O
to O
show O
the O
visiting O
relatives O
(newlyweds) O
all O
the O
beauty O
of O
our O
city, O
including O
the O
white O
nights. O

"Apartment B-TARGET
№ I-TARGET
55" I-TARGET
was O
chosen O
because O
of O
the O
location B-TARGET
and O
schedule, O
and O
well, O
the O
reviews O
are O
good. O

We O
often O
passed O
by O
and O
had O
an O
opportunity O
to O
stop O
by. O

We O
were O
given O
excellent O
food O
and O
drink O
on O
this O
cold O
night. O

I O
don't O
want O
to O
use O
the O
word O
service, O
because O
we O
were O
not O
"served" O
but O
warmly O
welcomed O
and O
very O
homely. O

They O
helped O
us O
with O
the O
order O
and O
recommended O
a O
good O
and O
inexpensive O
wine. B-TARGET

However, O
the O
order O
was O
not O
brought O
quickly, O
although O
there O
were O
only O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
restaurant O
busy O
except O
for O
us O
and O
there O
were O
people O
already O
sitting O
there O
for O
a O
long O
time O
drinking O
tea. O

The O
salads O
took O
about O
20 O
minutes O
and O
then O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
hot O
meal. O

We O
passed O
the O
time O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

The O
guests O
really O
liked O
the O
bieroger B-TARGET
cutlets I-TARGET
and O
veal B-TARGET
stew. I-TARGET

I O
took O
grilled O
baked B-TARGET
pork I-TARGET
chop I-TARGET
- O
it O
was O
a O
delight! O

The O
salads B-TARGET
were O
hearty O
and O
quite O
tasty, O
but O
unforgettable. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
were O
not O
huge O
but O
not O
small O
either. O
We O
were O
stuffed O
and O
didn't O
dare O
to O
have O
dessert O
yet, O
though O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
advised O
us O
very O
much O
and O
praised O
their O
desserts. O

So, O
we O
have O
a O
reason O
to O
come O
to O
the O
apartment B-TARGET
again! O

I O
want O
to O
say O
a O
big O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
"night B-TARGET
staff" I-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
who O
made O
our O
late O
dinner O
so O
enjoyable! O

For O
my O
girlfriend's O
birthday, O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant. O

I O
chose O
"Mizuki" B-TARGET
based O
on O
the O
reviews O
on O
this O
site O
and O
made O
no O
mistake O
- O
a O
very O
cosy O
place, B-TARGET
great O
food B-TARGET
(we O
ordered O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
chicken B-TARGET
rice), O
soft O
and O
quiet O
music. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
- O
good O
- O
waitresses, B-TARGET
when O
you O
notice O
that O
you O
look O
at O
them, O
- O
do O
not O
pretend O
not O
to O
notice, O
and O
fit:) O

We O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
orders O
any O
longer O
than O
you O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
restaurant O
- O
the O
plates O
came O
exactly O
at O
the O
moment O
when O
it O
first O
occurred O
to O
me O
that O
it's O
time O
to O
bring O
them)) O

In O
general, O
we O
had O
a O
wonderful O
evening O
and O
I O
will O
take O
my O
friends O
there O
now. O

We O
went O
with O
my O
husband O
at O
the O
weekend. O

It O
was O
very O
crowded, O
but O
we O
didn't O
have O
any O
problems O
with O
the O
table O
- O
we O
booked O
in O
advance. O

But O
it O
took O
them O
a O
long O
time O
to O
bring O
the O
order O
- O
but O
on O
the O
street O
with O
beer O
you O
can't O
hurry O
anywhere O
:) O

We O
liked O
the O
grill B-TARGET
and O
the O
beer B-TARGET
too. O

Few O
choices B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
no O
classics. O

These O
are O
the O
cons. O

But O
overall, O
the O
impression O
is O
good. O

From O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

People O
around O
are O
smiling, O
everybody's O
having O
a O
good O
time O
and O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

We O
will O
be O
back! O

As O
soon O
as O
they O
took O
the O
blinds O
off O
the O
big O
windows O
of O
Asahi O
(more O
than O
a O
year O
ago) O
the O
place O
didn't O
have O
the O
reputation O
of O
being O
expensive, O
tasteless O
and O
posh O
anymore. O

Two O
floors, O
very O
calm O
but O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
itself O
suddenly O
disposes O
to O
spend O
time O
there O
talking O
and O
eating O
"at O
the O
same O
time". O

As O
it O
is O
not O
far O
from O
our O
house O
we O
like O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
family O
conversations: O
here O
you O
can O
hear O
the O
other O
party O
even O
when O
the O
room O
is O
full. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
on O
the O
level. O

There O
is O
a O
reception O
and O
an O
escort O
(without O
frightening O
shouts O
in O
Japanese:)), O
and O
the O
order O
is O
repeated, O
and O
the O
sequence O
of O
dishes O
is O
respected, O
and O
the O
ashtray O
is O
changed O
without O
additional O
requests. O

On O
the O
menu, O
in O
addition O
to O
Japanese O
cuisine O
there O
is O
a O
"author" O
European O
cuisine, O
although O
these O
dishes O
take O
much O
longer O
to O
prepare O
than O
Japanese O
ones. O

Sushi B-TARGET
in O
Asahi O
is O
so-so, O
but O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
order O
them O
- O
there O
are O
excellent O
rolls, B-TARGET
where O
if O
you O
wish O
they O
will O
add O
cheese B-TARGET
Philadelphia, I-TARGET
besides, O
there O
are O
rolls B-TARGET
without I-TARGET
rice, I-TARGET
not O
bad O
sashimi, B-TARGET
wonderful O
light O
salads B-TARGET
(with O
salmon, O
crab, O
tuna), O
portions B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
salads I-TARGET
are O
big, O
from O
the O
hot O
- O
hearty O
salmon B-TARGET
teriyaki. I-TARGET

Of O
all O
the O
Japanese O
establishments O
in O
the O
Moskovskaya-Electrosila O
area, O
the O
crab B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
here O
is O
the O
most O
delicious. O

Until O
18 O
hours, O
two O
sushi B-TARGET
for O
the O
price O
of O
one, O
plus O
free O
food O
delivered O
home. O

In O
general, O
a O
decent O
place, B-TARGET
can O
be O
recommended O
as O
a O
meeting O
place O
for O
negotiations, O
and O
for O
a O
romantic O
meeting. O

Come O
here O
at O
least O
once O
a O
week. O

Hi, O
I O
had O
a O
birthday O
party O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
November O
(Friday, O
November O
15). O

There O
were O
five O
of O
us. O

We O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance O
as O
well O
as O
(cold O
appetizers, O
hot O
appetizers O
and O
drinks). O

We O
came, O
everything O
was O
ready. O

I O
chose O
a O
restaurant O
long O
enough. O

I O
really O
wanted O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
in O
a O
nice O
Georgian O
restaurant. O

I O
looked O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
options, O
read O
lots O
of O
online O
reviews O
and O
stopped O
at O
the O
restaurant O
"KAT". O

And O
it O
was O
great! O

It's O
a O
very O
cozy, O
small O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
- O
calm, O
warm O
colors. O

Very O
nice. O

There O
are O
not O
many O
tables. O

Very O
polite, O
nice O
staff. B-TARGET

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
young O
man O
(can't O
remember O
his O
name, O
unfortunately). O

Everything O
was O
of O
the O
highest O
level! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
amazing! O

I O
and O
my O
guests O
really O
liked O
it. O

There O
was O
live B-TARGET
music.) I-TARGET

We O
danced O
a O
lot. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
we O
were O
the O
most O
active O
and O
the O
noisiest O
in O
this O
plan O
)))). O

But O
we O
really O
wanted O
to O
dance O
because O
the O
singer O
was O
singing O
very O
nice O
songs! B-TARGET

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
sit O
still) O

In O
general, O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
that O
my O
birthday O
party O
at O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"CET". I-TARGET

The O
impressions O
of O
me O
and O
my O
guests O
were O
wonderful! O

I O
recommend O

P. O

S. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
whole O
team B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
!!! O

Everything O
was O
very, O
very O
wonderful!!!! O

We O
had O
a O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
Friday. O

Since O
there O
weren't O
many O
guests, O
we O
just O
booked O
a O
table. O

Had O
a O
great O
time. O

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
nice O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

We O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
present B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
for O
the O
newlyweds. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O

I O
advise O
everyone O
to O
go O
there, O
the O
prices O
are O
reasonable. O

There O
was O
a O
dancing O
show O
and O
live O
music O
on O
Friday O
and O
Saturday O
nights. O

I O
live O
not O
far O
from O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
often O
come O
here O
with O
family O
or O
friends, O
because O
you O
can O
always O
have O
a O
good O
meal O
and O
spend O
a O
pleasant O
evening. O

We O
have O
a O
very O
varied O
menu B-TARGET
and O
haven't O
tried O
everything O
yet. O

Very O
nice O
that O
there O
is O
Japanese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Italian I-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

Suitable O
for O
everybody) O

Pasta B-TARGET
and O
sushi B-TARGET
are O
always O
great! O

I O
like O
very O
much O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill. O

In O
general, O
the O
food B-TARGET
we I-TARGET
have I-TARGET
no O
complaints. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
itself O
is O
calm O
and O
pleasant. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
attentive O
but O
unobtrusive. O

I O
would O
love O
to O
go O
there O
with O
great O
pleasure.) O

We O
booked O
it O
last O
weekend O
(30.08.14) O
in O
small O
company. O

We O
wanted O
a O
new O
experience, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
we O
got O
it! O

We O
were O
served O
by O
the O
chef O
of O
the O
restaurant O
(he O
had O
a O
red O
armband, O
the O
rest O
- O
yellow). O

He O
was O
a O
nice O
man, B-TARGET
and O
even O
though O
he O
did O
not O
understand O
Russian, O
we O
hit O
it O
off). O

Very O
skillfully, O
and O
most O
importantly O
delicious, O
he O
cooked O
delicacies B-TARGET
for O
us. O

We O
watched O
with O
great O
interest O
this O
professional O
of O
his O
craft. O

Honestly, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
cooked O
taste O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
dishes O
at O
restaurants O
in O
Thailand, O
although O
the O
meat B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
a O
bit O
of O
a O
failure. O

When O
booking O
a O
table, O
the O
receptionist O
warned O
us O
that O
except O
for O
beer, O
they O
do O
not O
sell O
alcoholic O
beverages, O
but O
you O
can O
bring O
your O
own, O
for O
a O
little O
extra O
charge. O

Nice, O
relaxing O
appearance B-TARGET
of O
the O
room, O
cozy O
and O
unobtrusive. O

Special O
thanks O
to O
our O
waitress B-TARGET
Oxana O
- O
she O
practically O
never O
left O
us. O

Visitors B-TARGET
from O
the O
VIP-hall O
were O
very O
upset O
(it's O
a O
shame O
for O
ours): O
There O
is O
a O
small O
aquarium O
in O
which O
quite O
a O
big O
fish O
is O
floating, O
so O
one O
man, O
apparently O
a O
little O
bit O
drunk, O
could O
not O
keep O
back O
from O
this O
fish, O
well, O
as O
if O
he O
came O
to O
the O
zoo! O

In O
general O
- O
we O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
prosperity O
to O
you! O

We O
would O
love O
to O
come O
back! O

I O
was O
at O
this O
restaurant O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
with O
my O
girlfriend. O

The B-TARGET
décor I-TARGET
is O
neat O
and O
to O
my O
personal O
taste, O
but O
the O
TV B-TARGET
from O
the O
90's O
in O
the O
room O
surprised O
me O
and O
the O
inoperative O
fountain B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
center O
of O
the O
room O
adds O
to O
it. O

And O
the O
background B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
was O
the O
radio. O

They O
took O
the O
order O
quickly O
... O
and O
that O
was O
it, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
over. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
tea O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
minutes O
and O
then O
we O
brought O
the O
salad. O

I O
can't O
say O
that O
it O
was O
cooked O
badly, O
but O
it O
was O
edible. O

Rice O
also O
waited O
together O
with O
tea O
more O
than O
20 O
minutes, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
Chinese O
restaurant, O
as O
in O
the O
East, O
we O
all O
know O
well, O
always O
decorated O
and O
looks O
very O
appetizing, O
and O
so O
we O
brought O
rice B-TARGET
on O
a O
plate O
in O
such O
a O
form O
that O
I O
did O
not O
even O
eat O
it. O

As O
if O
the O
rice B-TARGET
was O
lifted O
from O
the O
floor, O
huge O
lumps. O

In O
general, O
after O
that O
we O
paid O
the O
bill O
and O
left... O

After O
that O
we O
paid O
the O
bill O
and O
left. O
One O
or O
another O
waitress B-TARGET
worked O
and O
each O
one O
thought O
that O
we O
were O
served O
and O
brought O
an O
order. O

I O
would O
have O
understood O
it O
if O
there O
was O
a O
full O
house. O
In O
fact O
3-5 O
tables O
were O
taken O
together O
with O
us. O

Went O
to O
"Prague" O
recently O
with O
my O
boyfriend. O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
change O
of O
interior. B-TARGET

It O
became O
very O
cozy O
and O
comfortable. O

Wooden O
tables B-TARGET
and O
chairs B-TARGET
blended O
perfectly O
with O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
place. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
nice O
too. O

Waitresses B-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
friendly. O

As O
for O
the O
cuisine.... O

We O
chose O
a O
dish B-TARGET
but O
it O
was O
out O
of O
stock. O

It O
was O
explained O
to O
us O
that O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
change O
of O
the O
menu, O
because O
the O
chef O
had O
changed, O
and O
that O
they O
had O
a O
new O
menu O
in O
print, O
so O
there O
were O
some O
missing O
items. B-TARGET

We O
were O
advised O
to O
order O
the O
new O
salad B-TARGET
"From I-TARGET
Chef" I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
breast I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
oranges I-TARGET
- O
we O
liked O
it, O
very O
tasty. O

Also O
tried O
their O
special O
steak, B-TARGET
which O
(as O
they O
say O
on O
the O
menu) O
was O
cooked O
according O
to O
Czech O
recipe O
- O
VERY O
GOOD! O

Were O
you O
able O
to O
walk O
into O
a O
restaurant O
and O
have O
a O
table O
or O
take O
a O
table O
with O
you? O

Beer. O

Very O
convenient O
was O
that O
you O
can O
order O
a O
3 O
litre O
tower, O
you O
can O
pour O
your O
own O
beer O
in O
a O
glass, O
we O
drank O
Pilsner B-TARGET
- O
the O
taste O
is O
pretty O
good, O
but O
for O
me O
a O
bitter, O
probably O
a O
kind O
of O
bitter. O

I O
tried O
other O
beers B-TARGET
and O
chose O
cherry, B-TARGET
I O
liked O
its O
unusual O
taste, O
I O
advise O
all O
the O
girls. O

In O
general, O
we O
were O
pleased O
with O
the O
evening, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
try O
some O
dishes O
from O
the O
new O
menu. O

A O
small O
and O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
were O
met O
by O
an O
elegant O
man B-TARGET
who O
took O
our O
clothes O
and O
showed O
us O
into O
the O
hall. O

Later, O
looking O
at O
photographs O
on O
the O
walls O
we O
saw O
the O
man O
in O
all O
the O
pictures O
and O
we O
realized O
that O
it O
was O
the O
owner. O

Welcoming O
the O
guests O
the O
owner B-TARGET
- O
this O
means O
a O
lot, O
I O
have O
not O
met O
in O
St. O
Petersburg. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
rather O
cozy O
inside O
but O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
small O
and O
it O
is O
rather O
cramped O
for O
four O
people O
sitting O
at O
a O
table, O
especially O
when O
you O
are O
cooking. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
rather O
sophisticated O
but O
it O
does O
not O
boast O
10 O
salads, O
10 O
main O
courses O
etc. O

You O
could O
say O
that O
it O
is O
even O
modest. O

But O
in O
the O
same O
time O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
there O
is O
excellent O
and O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
exquisite O
and O
very O
tasty. O

There, O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
I O
tasted O
marble O
beef. O
I've O
seen O
it O
in O
many O
restaurants, O
but O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
here. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
was O
very O
tender O
and O
melted O
in O
the O
mouth! O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
not O
large, O
but O
not O
too O
small O
either, O
just O
enough O
to O
eat O
up O
everything O
you O
ordered. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
very O
cosy O
and O
makes O
you O
feel O
at O
home. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
good. O

I O
should O
say O
straight O
away O
that O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
cheap, O
the O
approximate O
bill O
is O
2000 O
roubles O
per O
person. O

If O
you O
don't O
look O
at O
the O
price O
then O
it's O
recommended O
to O
visit O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
will O
include O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
my O
white O
list, O
and O
will O
always O
have O
it O
on O
the O
list. O

It O
is O
beautiful. O

Tasty. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
"level". O

That O
is O
the O
"level" O
it O
is O
focused O
on, O
not O
the O
client)). O

We O
arrived O
at O
23, O
on O
a O
weekday, O
for O
a O
meal O
for O
two. O

The O
restaurant O
seemed O
to O
be O
empty O
and O
we O
could O
see O
other O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant O
just O
looking O
closer. O

There O
were O
more O
staff B-TARGET
than O
guests. O

We O
went O
upstairs O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
and O
were O
greeted O
by O
a O
girl O
who O
offered O
us O
a O
couple O
of O
small O
tables. O

We O
wanted O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
big O
table O
with O
couches. O

Well, O
really O
wanted O
a O
sofa)). O

The O
girl B-TARGET
categorically O
said: O
"No, O
the O
large O
tables O
are O
for O
large O
companies, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
is O
reserved." O

Funny, O
one O
is O
occupied, O
one O
is O
reserved O
and O
a O
few O
more O
are O
empty, O
but O
we O
can't O
sit O
where O
we O
like, O
since O
there O
are O
only O
two O
of O
us. O

Well O
suddenly, O
there's O
a O
full O
house O
at O
this O
restaurant O
unexpectedly O
at O
midnight, O
okay O
let's O
not O
take O
up O
so O
much O
space O
with O
ourselves. O

Of O
course, O
no O
one O
else O
showed O
up O
before O
closing O
time. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
good. O

The O
music B-TARGET
too. O

Good O
day! O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
am O
writing O
a O
review O
of O
a O
restaurant, O
I O
was O
so O
impressed O
with O
the O
place. B-TARGET

Wonderful O
food, B-TARGET
cozy O
interior, B-TARGET
friendly O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
friendly O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

It's O
impossible O
to O
go O
there O
with O
a O
bad O
mood O
and O
hungry, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
very O
large!) O

I O
was O
very O
impressed O
by O
the O
food, O
especially O
the O
price... O
great O
food B-TARGET
for O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
money. O

We O
went O
with O
a O
young O
man O
and O
ordered O
a O
Bavarian B-TARGET
omelet I-TARGET
260r, O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
warm I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
liver O
260r, O
0,5l. O
Beer B-TARGET
0,5 O
l. O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
for O
250 O
rubles, O
the O
price O
was O
only O
990 O
rubles O
all O
together. O

The O
overall O
experience O
was O
wonderful, O
we O
will O
visit O
more!!! O
))))) O

I O
had O
a O
drink O
with O
my O
friends O
at O
the O
Metropole. B-TARGET

I O
had O
a O
drink O
at O
the O
pub O
and O
I O
was O
really O
looking O
forward O
to O
it. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
at O
a O
very O
high O
level, O
it O
feels O
that O
the O
institution B-TARGET
keeps O
its O
brand. O

Good O
looking O
place, B-TARGET
lots O
of O
food, O
lots O
of O
drinks, B-TARGET
tea O
and O
coffee B-TARGET
making O
facilities. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
helpful, O
he O
didn't O
even O
write O
down O
our O
order, O
he O
remembered O
everything, O
so O
I O
guess O
he O
knows O
his O
stuff O
:) O

I O
should O
say O
right O
away O
about O
the O
prices, O
it's O
not O
a O
diner, O
so O
for O
a O
good O
dinner O
and O
beer O
one O
person O
should O
have O
at O
least O
1500 O
rubles. O

But O
if O
you O
really O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
nice O
evening O
in O
a O
decent O
place, B-TARGET
it's O
worth O
it. O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
not O
small O
and O
beer B-TARGET
is O
tasty, O
dishes O
were O
cooked O
not O
very O
long, O
we O
didn't O
get O
tired O
while O
waiting. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
pub O
was O
very O
pub-ready O
and O
the O
food O
was O
cooked O
not O
too O
long, O
we O
didn't O
have O
time O
to O
get O
tired O
before O
we O
left O
the O
pub. O

A O
special O
thanks O
for O
the O
beauty, B-TARGET
the O
interiors! B-TARGET

I O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
came O
in O
one O
Saturday O
night, O
and O
we O
were O
afraid O
that O
there O
wouldn't O
be O
any O
seats O
as O
we O
hadn't O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

Our O
fears O
proved O
to O
be O
unfounded, O
there O
were O
seats. O

To O
be O
more O
exact O
we O
entered O
a O
completely O
empty O
room, O
nice, O
half-dark, O
with O
a O
nice O
decor, B-TARGET
but O
suspiciously O
deserted. O

Having O
chosen O
the O
table B-TARGET
we O
liked O
we O
sat O
down O
and O
immediately O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
appeared O
who O
brought O
the O
menu O
and O
answered O
my O
questions O
about O
the O
arrival O
of O
oysters. O

I O
want O
to O
mention O
straight O
away O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
everything O
was O
clear O
and O
unobtrusive; O
the O
only O
problem O
was O
that O
they O
didn't O
serve O
hot O
meal O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
but O
that's O
not O
a O
big O
deal. O

So O
we O
took O
oysters. O

I O
got O
fresh O
oysters O
and O
my O
companion O
got O
baked O
oysters. O

I O
can't O
say O
that O
these O
are O
the O
best O
oysters B-TARGET
I O
have O
ever O
had, O
but O
on O
the O
whole, O
quite O
good. O

I O
had O
fillet O
of O
Norwegian B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
as O
a O
hot I-TARGET
dish O
- O
a O
wonderful O
dish. O

My O
companion, O
having O
decided O
not O
to O
experiment O
any O
more, O
got, O
I O
think, O
pasta) O

Later O
I O
wanted O
more O
tea O
and O
desserts, O
but O
- O
alas! O
- O
there O
were O
no O
desserts B-TARGET
at O
all... O

Except O
for O
strawberry O
soup O
and O
ice O
cream. O

All O
in O
all, O
very O
decent. O

I O
can't O
say O
that O
I O
will O
visit O
this O
place O
often, O
but O
I O
will O
probably O
go O
there O
again O
one O
day. O

I O
was O
at O
this O
restaurant O
yesterday O
with O
my O
friend. O

It's O
not O
the O
first O
time O
we've O
been O
there. O

And O
the O
first O
thing O
that O
amazes O
me O
when O
you O
enter O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
beautiful O
and O
very O
unusual O
interior, B-TARGET
I O
haven't O
seen O
anything O
like O
it O
in O
any O
restaurant O
in O
our O
city. O

The O
next O
thing O
you O
notice O
once O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
very O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
always O
smiling O
and O
ready O
to O
help O
in O
the O
choice O
of O
dishes. O

Now O
about O
the O
main O
thing O
- O
the O
food. O

I've O
had O
time O
to O
try O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
on O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

And O
I O
always O
like O
it O
very O
much. O

For O
example, O
yesterday O
I O
ordered O
cream B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
ravioli B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushrooms. I-TARGET

The O
portions O
are O
very O
big O
and O
everything O
is O
delicious. O

In O
Roll O
& O
Roll B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
I O
always O
order O
new O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
confidence, O
because O
I O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
with O
my O
choice. O

There's O
a O
large O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
alcohol I-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices, B-TARGET
many O
beers B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
tap, I-TARGET
and O
an O
extensive O
wine B-TARGET
list. I-TARGET

And O
you O
can O
also O
try O
very O
tasty O
cocktails B-TARGET
made O
by O
the O
bartender. O

Roll B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Roll I-TARGET
has O
become O
not O
only O
a O
favorite O
in O
the O
area O
but O
probably O
in O
the O
whole O
town. O

I O
really O
like O
it O
and O
I've O
been O
there O
twice O
and O
I O
guess O
I'll O
be O
there O
again. O

Very O
tasty O
food, B-TARGET
but O
the O
portions O
are O
so O
big O
that O
after O
eating O
a O
salad O
it's O
hard O
to O
eat O
the O
main O
course...) O

However, O
I O
think O
that O
men O
will O
like O
the O
portions B-TARGET
very O
much! O

Good O
wine. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice O
- O
in O
truth O
I O
liked O
the O
first B-TARGET
hall I-TARGET
better O
- O
it O
was O
more O
of O
a O
restaurant O
type, O
and O
many O
people O
like O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
second O
hall, O
reminding O
by O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
a O
Greek O
tavern. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
decent O
- O
nice O
waitresses, B-TARGET
all O
without O
delay, O
all O
with O
a O
smile. O

In O
general O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
welcoming. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
family O
celebration O
on O
30th O
May O
in O
Amadeus. O

Finally O
found O
the O
right O
time O
to O
leave O
my O
feedback O
and O
thank O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
and O
cozy O
fireplace B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
beautiful O
decor B-TARGET
and O
interior! B-TARGET

We O
chose O
the B-TARGET
Fireside I-TARGET
Hall I-TARGET
for O
our O
special O
event. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
join O
all O
the O
positive O
feedback O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
very O
pleased O
to O
work O
with O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Sergey, O
and O
want O
to O
express O
special O
gratitude O
to O
his O
efforts O
and O
efforts O
in O
the O
organization O
and O
execution O
of O
the O
event. O

All O
our O
requests O
and O
comments O
were O
taken O
into O
account, O
down O
to O
the O
smallest O
detail. O

Very O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
team B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
waiters, I-TARGET
everything O
was O
on O
time O
and O
by O
the O
way, O
from O
serving B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
to O
basic O
cleanliness O
on O
the O
tables. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
talk O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
- O
polite, O
smiling O
and O
friendly. O

I O
liked O
the O
food B-TARGET
- O
a O
very O
beautiful O
arrangement B-TARGET
and O
serving B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
and O
the O
taste B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
left O
a O
very O
positive O
impression, O
it O
was O
delicious O
and O
relatively O
inexpensive. O

We O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
food, O
thank O
you O
very O
much. O

P. O

S. O

Well O
just O
can't O
keep O
silent O
about O
another O
nice O
moment O
- O
on O
the O
day O
of O
celebration O
at O
the O
restaurant O
a O
package O
with O
a O
gift O
was O
left, O
which O
ended O
up O
nowhere O
and O
was O
not O
lost O
at O
all! O

The O
very O
next O
day O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Sergei O
contacted O
us O
and O
pleased O
us O
with O
good O
news! O

We O
came O
to O
this O
place O
on O
June O
4, O
2014 O
to O
eat O
kebab... O

We O
ordered O
beef O
and O
pork. O

Sat O
waiting O
for O
the O
order O
for O
about O
30 O
minutes, O
then O
the O
man B-TARGET
"on O
the O
poker" O
came O
up O
to O
us O
and O
said O
he O
was O
very O
sorry O
and O
that O
the O
kebab O
would O
be O
brought O
soon...In O
about O
10 O
minutes O
we O
were O
brought O
cold O
meat B-TARGET
(and O
that O
we O
took O
2 O
different O
ones)... O

When O
we O
said O
the O
kebab B-TARGET
was O
cold O
the O
same O
man B-TARGET
apologized O
to O
us O
again O
and O
offered O
to O
heat O
it O
up... O
It O
tasted B-TARGET
like O
crap O
(my O
husband O
didn't O
eat O
half O
of O
it, O
though O
he O
usually O
eats O
everything O
that O
isn't O
nailed O
down)... O

This O
is O
the O
only O
place B-TARGET
we O
haven't O
left O
money O
for O
tea O
in O
the O
last O
5 O
years! O

I O
would O
never O
recommend O
food O
from O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
anyone. O

Though O
they O
brought O
the O
bill O
in O
a O
minute. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
this O
cafe O
(by O
the O
way O
we O
live O
very O
close O
to O
it). O

It B-TARGET
seemed O
to O
be O
very O
well, O
because O
the O
interior B-TARGET
helps O
you O
relax. O

It O
was O
very O
cosy, O
very O
cosy. O
The O
food O
is O
cooked O
really O
fast O
and O
tasty O
in O
my O
opinion. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
pleasant, O
cheerful O
girl B-TARGET
who O
helped O
us O
bring O
food O
and O
mix O
cocktails O
and O
even O
made O
us O
a O
discount. B-TARGET

In O
this O
cafe B-TARGET
I O
will O
come O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O
