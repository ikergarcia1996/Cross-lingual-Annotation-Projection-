Very O
cute, O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
modest O
prices O
for O
huge O
portions B-TARGET
of O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

We O
celebrated O
our O
birthday, O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
bring O
our O
cake O
with O
candles. O

Salads B-TARGET
with O
fresh O
greens, B-TARGET
meat B-TARGET
and O
chicken B-TARGET
are O
delicate, O
and O
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
semi-fried O
almond, B-TARGET
is O
something O
fabulously O
delicious. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
smiling. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
didn't O
like O
a O
little O
- O
long O
waiting O
for O
the O
start O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
(apparently O
because O
of O
the O
large O
number O
of O
people) O
and O
from O
the O
neighboring O
tables O
nobody O
killed O
the O
dishes O
when O
people O
left. O

But O
these O
are O
small O
things. O

The O
overall O
impression O
is O
beautiful. O

We O
advise! O

Great O
restaurant, B-TARGET
have O
been O
here O
several O
times O
and O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O

Both O
I O
and O
my O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
at O
the O
level, O
all O
fresh, O
tasty O
and O
authentic) O

Especially O
I O
want O
to O
note O
the O
alcoholic B-TARGET
beverages I-TARGET
- O
the O
wine B-TARGET
is O
just O
great, O
the O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
impeccable. O

The O
musicians B-TARGET
were O
delighted O
- O
played O
spiritually, O
so O
we O
did O
not O
miss O
the O
opportunity O
to O
dance. O

The O
account O
for O
all O
this O
magnificence O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
quite O
small O
- O
especially O
considering O
that O
we O
sat O
for O
6 O
hours O
and O
didn't O
refuse O
anything. O

Of O
the O
small O
shortcomings O
- O
cigars B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
old-fashioned O
- O
too O
dry, O
forgot O
to O
serve O
a O
few O
snacks O
"to O
the O
table" O
(although, O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
best O
- O
we't O
have O
them O
already), O
the O
administrator, B-TARGET
receiving O
orders O
for O
the O
banquet, O
should O
be O
a O
little O
more O
friendly O
and O
more O
interested O
in O
the O
process O
- O
for O
example, O
to O
help O
in O
the O
selection O
of O
dishes, O
to O
advise O
something, O
and O
not O
just O
to O
write O
with O
a O
boring O
person. O

Overall, O
the O
party O
was O
successful, O
everything O
was O
at O
the O
level. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
to O
you O
again! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful! O

For O
me, O
this O
is O
just O
the O
ideal O
interior B-TARGET
of O
a O
small O
restaurant. O

Very O
cozy, O
somehow O
warm O
and O
homey, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very, O
very O
beautiful O
and O
tasteful! O

I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
there. O

Prices O
are O
very O
affordable O
for O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Now O
about O
the O
minus. O

First, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
strange. O

Per O
we O
were O
just O
caught O
by O
an O
unfriendly O
waitress, B-TARGET
but O
his O
appearance O
and O
manner O
of O
speaking O
was O
repulsive. O

In O
addition, O
I O
was O
just O
surprised O
that O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
either O
don’t O
speak O
English, O
or O
speak, O
but O
carefully O
hide O
it. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
for O
some O
reason O
only O
communicated O
with O
me, O
and O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
translate O
this O
to O
a O
foreign O
satellite, O
after O
which O
he O
surprised O
me O
- O
do O
they O
not O
speak O
English? O

For O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
city O
centre, O
I O
find O
this O
unacceptable. O

But O
that's O
not O
all O
- O
instead O
of O
one O
soup O
I O
brought O
another O
similar O
without O
any O
warning. O

I O
didn’t O
notice O
it O
immediately O
and O
I O
had O
absolutely O
no O
desire O
to O
conflict O
that O
night, O
so O
I O
didn’t O
call O
the O
waitress O
and O
get O
it O
done. O

About O
the O
kitchen O
I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
firm O
salad B-TARGET
Claret I-TARGET
I O
did O
not O
like O
at O
all, O
there O
are O
no O
complaints O
about O
wine B-TARGET
and O
desserts, B-TARGET
meat B-TARGET
I O
did O
not O
take, O
but O
my O
friend O
liked O
it. O

Overall, O
the O
experience O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
but O
it O
could O
have O
been O
better O
if O
it O
wasn’t O
a O
strange O
service. B-TARGET

We O
were O
brought O
here O
with O
a O
huge O
desire O
to O
eat O
meat, O
drink O
quality O
beer O
and O
watch O
the O
Zenit-Twente O
match. O

Now O
in O
order. O

We O
have O
a O
meeting.) B-TARGET

is O
pleased. O

A O
cute O
blonde B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
Elena O
guided O
us O
and O
offered O
us O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
only O
free O
table. O

Not O
comfortable, O
but O
it O
doesn’t O
matter. O

Because O
as O
soon O
as O
there O
was O
an O
opportunity O
to O
sit O
with O
comfort, O
we O
were O
immediately O
offered O
to O
move.) O

He O
gave O
us O
the O
menu O
and O
gave O
us O
time O
to O
think. O

Until O
the O
girl O
came, O
we O
didn’t O
think O
of O
anything O
like O
that. O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
steak B-TARGET
"Tower" I-TARGET
firstly O
the O
cook, B-TARGET
very O
deliciously O
cooked, O
secondly O
the O
girl B-TARGET
for O
advice. O

Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
pleased O
with O
us, O
the O
grains B-TARGET
were O
great O
(I O
honestly O
don't O
eat O
such O
grains B-TARGET
anywhere). O

The O
beer B-TARGET
was O
very O
delicious, O
we O
tried O
different O
things, O
and O
for O
three O
Velvet O
my O
friend O
gave O
another O
firm O
towel.))) O

Nice O
little O
things, O
but O
very O
happy. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quiet O
without O
obligation. O

Soft O
sofas, B-TARGET
comfortable O
which O
is O
very O
important O
now!) O

It O
fits O
well O
with O
the O
size O
of O
the O
tables. O

Total O
rating O
9 O
out O
of O
10. O

Why O
9? O

Problems O
with O
ventilation. B-TARGET

Very O
smoked. O

We O
even O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

Everyone O
remains O
satisfied. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back.) O

prosperity O
and O
success) O

Thanks O
to O
staff) B-TARGET

I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
having O
breakfast O
at O
this O
lovely O
restaurant. B-TARGET

About O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
here O
many O
have O
already O
written O
that O
it O
is O
like O
home. O

I O
cannot O
disagree O
with O
this. O

I O
rarely O
ever O
eat O
oatmeal B-TARGET
cooked O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
I O
cook O
it O
at O
home. O

The B-TARGET
portion I-TARGET
was O
very O
decent! O

I O
also O
ordered O
to O
try O
Napoleon. O

The O
cake B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
portion B-TARGET
is O
large, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
cooked O
anywhere O
as O
my O
grandmother O
cooked, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
delicious. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
but O
it O
did O
not O
excite O
me. O

I O
think O
for O
such O
an O
establishment O
very O
much O
nothing, O
much O
more O
and O
not O
needed. O

Although O
sofas B-TARGET
could O
be O
made O
more O
cozy, O
more O
"home", O
with O
pillows. O

And O
somehow O
confused O
the O
glass O
door O
to O
the O
toilet, B-TARGET
considering O
that O
there O
is O
a O
table O
in O
front O
of O
it O
and O
visitors O
can O
sit, O
somehow O
uncomfortable. O

I O
expected O
everything O
to O
be O
more O
"apartmental" O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
more O
"caffeine". O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
quiet, O
more O
difficult O
to O
say, O
because O
I O
was O
almost O
alone. O

I O
think O
I’ll O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place O
for O
lunch O
and O
dinner. O

Great O
place, B-TARGET
very O
delicious O
cooked, O
huge O
portions, B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
one O
hot B-TARGET
for O
four O
(!) O
and O
then O
could O
not O
eat. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
was O
nothing O
special, O
clean O
and O
quiet, O
music O
in O
the O
neighboring O
hall, O
but O
we O
specifically O
wanted O
it O
without O
music. O

A O
polite O
and O
helpful O
waitress, B-TARGET
alcohol O
can O
be O
brought O
with O
you, O
only O
to O
buy O
something O
else O
from O
alcohol O
from O
them. O

I O
liked O
it, O
we O
will O
come O
again.) O

The O
house B-TARGET
is O
not O
cheap! O

The O
big O
minus O
is O
that O
they O
do O
not O
sell O
alcohol B-TARGET
separately, O
but O
only O
in O
cocktails! B-TARGET

At O
least O
that’s O
what O
the O
bartender O
told O
me. O

Wine B-TARGET
only O
in O
small O
individual O
bottles, O
no O
beer B-TARGET
at O
all!!! O

We O
ordered O
a O
few O
salads, O
so O
we O
cooked O
them O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour!!! O
although O
there O
was O
only O
one O
company O
in O
the O
bar O
besides O
us. O

I O
don’t O
know O
what O
the O
cook O
was O
doing O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

The O
bartender B-TARGET
told O
us O
all O
the O
time O
that O
our O
salads O
were O
almost O
ready. O

In O
general, O
despite O
the O
pleasant O
interior, B-TARGET
I O
don’t O
want O
to O
come O
here O
for O
any O
more O
reasons O
:( O

A O
great O
place! B-TARGET

So O
rarely O
combines O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
decent O
service. B-TARGET

The O
price O
is O
very O
democratic. O

We O
visited O
together O
with O
a O
friend. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
quite O
decent, O
we O
met O
at O
the O
entrance, O
guided O
throughout O
the O
institution, O
everyone O
showed, O
patiently O
waited O
until O
we O
finally O
decided O
where O
to O
sit, O
although O
we O
chose O
a O
long O
time) O

Luckily O
I O
got O
free. O

Clothed O
with O
pillows, O
collapsed O
in O
a O
tie, B-TARGET
wrapped O
in O
grace. O

Food O
was O
brought O
fast O
enough: O
drinks O
almost O
immediately, O
salad O
minutes O
after O
15, O
hot O
minutes O
after O
10 O
after O
salads. O

I O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
– O
Napoleon, B-TARGET
very O
delicious). O

In O
general, O
despite O
the O
previous O
comment, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
there. O

By O
the O
way, O
I O
ordered O
Cosmopolitan B-TARGET
- O
a O
normal O
cocktail B-TARGET
and O
alcohol O
there O
is O
enough. O

The O
name O
of O
the O
restaurant O
obliges O
you O
to O
try O
this O
dish, B-TARGET
the O
variety O
of O
variations O
of O
which O
is O
pleasantly O
surprising. O

We O
chose O
Chebureques B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
potatoes, I-TARGET
smoothed O
them O
with O
cream B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
it O
was O
delicious! O

Very O
nutritious O
gentle O
dish, B-TARGET
a O
little O
spicy, O
not O
fat O
at O
all, O
I O
recommend! O

There O
was O
also O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
peel, I-TARGET
which O
I O
would O
have O
given O
7 O
out O
of O
10, O
to O
my O
taste O
an O
unsuccessful O
combination O
of O
ingredients, O
the O
vegetables O
gave O
an O
excessive O
amount O
of O
juice, O
and O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
of O
the O
dish O
with O
a O
rubbed O
egg O
looked O
somehow O
not O
solid. O

The O
pork B-TARGET
slice I-TARGET
was O
almost O
delicious O
if O
the O
salted B-TARGET
piece I-TARGET
(one O
in O
five) O
had O
not O
been O
caught. O

It’s O
a O
pity O
that O
we O
don’t O
eat O
lamb, O
the O
dishes O
from O
this O
meat O
prevail O
in O
the O
menu. O

Service B-TARGET
and O
delivery B-TARGET
speed I-TARGET
just O
stunned O
us, O
Chebureques O
brought O
4 O
minutes O
later, O
drinks O
even O
faster, O
the O
steak O
was O
served O
just O
at O
the O
right O
time, O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
- O
delivery O
(in O
recent O
times O
in O
many O
places O
count O
from O
10 O
minutes O
and O
longer...) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
was O
pleasant, O
we O
rested O
on O
the O
benches B-TARGET
opposite O
each O
other, O
as O
if O
in O
a O
secluded O
pavilion, O
it O
was O
cozy O
and O
no O
one O
disturbed O
us. O

When O
we O
left, O
we O
looked O
into O
all O
the O
halls, O
we O
liked O
the O
fireplace, B-TARGET
near O
which O
you O
can O
spend O
a O
pleasant O
romantic O
evening. O

The O
lighting O
hall B-TARGET
was O
good O
too, O
but O
we O
felt O
that O
there O
were O
too O
many O
tables. O

Summary: O
a O
quality, O
cozy O
and O
delicious O
place, B-TARGET
we O
will O
go. O

We O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Appetit, O
before O
they O
were O
not O
there, O
ordered O
a O
table. O
when O
we O
came, O
they O
were O
a O
little O
disappointed, O
because O
the O
table B-TARGET
was O
straight O
at O
the O
entrance, O
we O
wanted O
to O
sit O
behind O
the O
other, O
but O
we O
were O
kindly O
told O
that O
let O
someone O
else O
sit O
while O
the O
waitress O
left O
we O
quickly O
at O
the O
other O
table O
in O
front O
of O
the O
seats, O
because O
there O
we O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
warmer. O

We O
went O
through O
these O
coldest O
days. O

It O
was O
cold O
and O
we O
wore O
jackets. O

People O
who O
came, O
sometimes O
did O
not O
watch O
the O
door, O
had O
to O
ask O
that O
the O
door O
be O
closed. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
from O
the O
staff O
then O
regretted O
us, O
asked O
if O
it O
wasn’t O
cold O
for O
us, O
but O
everything O
was O
obvious. O

I O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
rolls. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting. O

In O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
halls B-TARGET
is O
more O
comfortable. O
so O
in O
the O
cold O
in O
this O
room, B-TARGET
which O
at O
the O
entrance O
is O
better O
not O
to O
order O
a O
table.))) O

Visited O
the O
building O
on O
February O
23. O

They O
were O
welcomed, O
led O
to O
the O
wardrobe O
and O
the O
table. O

On O
the O
second O
floor O
most O
of O
the O
tables O
were O
occupied O
or O
there O
was O
a O
reserve, O
but O
there O
was O
room O
for O
us O
three. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
is O
not O
very O
convenient O
made O
- O
separate O
folders O
of O
grill, O
Japanese O
menu O
and O
Italian. O

In O
the O
end, O
they O
were O
sitting O
with O
them O
like O
monkeys O
in O
a O
postcard O
shop))) O

For O
all O
men O
on O
February O
23th, O
a O
gift-bottle O
of O
vodka-as O
it O
is O
insolent. O

Sushi O
was O
mostly O
ordered. O

Drinks O
were O
not O
waiting O
very O
long, O
10 O
minutes, O
but O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
orders O
everything O
is O
difficult... O

First O
we O
brought O
a O
salad O
for O
the O
girl, O
and O
we O
sat O
down O
and O
licked. O

Then O
soup O
for O
a O
friend, O
and O
then O
all O
sushi O
(minutes O
after O
30) O
Sushi B-TARGET
tasty, O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
-medium O
enough. O

Kimchi B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
portion B-TARGET
is O
large. O

Impressions O
- O
cozy, O
delicious, O
a O
large O
selection O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
every O
taste( O
steaks, O
fish O
grill, O
risotto, O
sushi, O
pizza, O
pasta, O
ear...) O

I O
apologize O
for O
not O
understanding O
each O
dish O
in O
detail, O
because O
the O
impressions O
remained O
general, O
and O
we O
did O
not O
order O
anything O
special. O

From O
the O
table O
we O
cleaned O
not O
often, O
and O
various O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
nevertheless O
everyone O
was O
pretty O
kind O
and O
smiling. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
girlfriend O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2010, O
a O
nice O
cafe, B-TARGET
sat O
on O
the O
terrace. O

The O
service O
at O
first O
was O
upset: O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
put O
us O
to O
the O
table O
and O
left. O
the O
menu O
on O
the O
table O
did O
not O
appear, O
we O
expected O
it O
to O
be O
brought O
to O
us O
now, O
we O
waited O
about O
10 O
minutes! O
but O
there O
was O
no O
one. O
after O
this O
we O
managed O
to O
catch O
another O
boy O
and O
ask O
him O
to O
bring, O
he O
was O
in O
shock O
that O
we O
even O
had O
no O
menu O
so O
far, O
accepted O
the O
order, O
food O
and O
cocktails O
brought O
quickly, O
served O
well O
and O
carefully, O
than O
corrected O
the O
initial O
negative O
impression. O

The O
kitchen O
is O
ordinary O
in O
my O
opinion, O
nothing O
special, O
but O
the O
prices O
are O
clearly O
overpriced. O

Charlotte B-TARGET
is O
really O
delicious, O
"home" O
:) O
for O
desserts B-TARGET
I O
would O
come O
back O
again. O

It O
is O
nice O
to O
sit O
and O
talk. O

What O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
about O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
tight. O

It O
is O
not O
very O
pleasant O
to O
sit O
close O
to O
other O
tables O
and O
be O
forced O
to O
listen O
to O
other O
people's O
conversations. O

A O
lot O
of O
men O
who O
sit O
and O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
look O
from O
top O
to O
bottom, O
as O
if O
for O
them O
specifically O
and O
came O
to O
exhibit. O

It O
seemed O
that O
both O
men O
and O
ladies O
go O
there O
to O
look O
for O
dating O
for O
easy O
time. O

Everything O
else O
is O
very O
cute O
:) O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
tonight. O

We O
were O
offered O
a O
VIP O
cabinet O
(see O
photo O
gallery O
of O
the O
restaurant). O

We O
liked O
everything: O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
invite O
our O
friends O
to O
celebrate O
their O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
administrator B-TARGET
Victoria O
immediately O
compiled O
the O
menu, O
took O
into O
account O
all O
our O
wishes, O
gave O
advice O
on O
holding O
the O
banquet. O

The O
meeting O
of O
friends O
(we O
were O
eight O
people) O
went O
great O
- O
everyone O
was O
very O
pleased. O

And O
the O
beautiful O
separate O
hall B-TARGET
(see O
photo O
gallery), O
and O
the O
attentive O
but O
non-obsessive O
staff, B-TARGET
and O
the O
original O
kitchen B-TARGET
(we O
took O
8 O
different O
hot B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
each O
claimed O
to O
have O
the O
most O
delicious) O
- O
everything O
was O
just O
"super". O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
a O
wonderful O
evening, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
again. O

P.S. O
By O
the O
way: O
great O
restaurant B-TARGET
website, I-TARGET
menu!!! B-TARGET

The O
wedding O
banquet O
was O
held O
on O
July O
10. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
express O
our O
great O
thanks O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
and O
separately O
to B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
administrator I-TARGET
Elena O
for O
the O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
has O
been O
chosen O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
has O
never O
regretted O
its O
choice. O

Of O
the O
pros, O
I O
will O
name O
the O
wonderful O
location B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
(if O
there O
are O
guests O
from O
other O
cities, O
this O
is O
especially O
important). O

I O
liked O
the O
food B-TARGET
itself, O
the O
cook B-TARGET
is O
a O
miracle! O
we O
chose O
a O
menu O
for O
1500 O
per O
person, O
ordered O
a O
dish O
from O
the O
chef O
and O
another O
salad, O
but O
without O
our O
food B-TARGET
supplements O
it O
would O
be O
enough. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
suitable O
for O
wedding O
events, O
so O
cozy O
and O
solemn! O

We O
had O
32 O
guests, O
all O
of O
whom O
had O
very O
good O
impressions. O

thank O
you! O

Alfie O
and O
Ivan. O

We O
frequently O
visit O
Tan O
Zhen O
on O
the O
Great O
Avenue O
of O
V.O. O

Impressions O
are O
only O
positive. O
(The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
modest, O
noisy, O
but) O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
get O
there O
on O
the O
weekend, O
so O
it O
is O
better O
to O
order O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

Several O
times O
came O
in O
the O
weekend O
without O
order, O
but O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
always O
able O
to O
find O
a O
free O
table))) O

I O
really O
like O
the O
service: B-TARGET
fast, O
large O
portions, B-TARGET
helpful O
waitresses. B-TARGET

I O
ordered O
a O
banquet O
room. O

Individualized O
approach O
to O
customers. O

Visit O
better O
company: O
for O
four O
we O
usually O
order O
2 O
salads O
and O
2 O
hot O
ones. O

Favorite O
dishes: O
Troika B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
calmar B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
tongue. B-TARGET

I O
think O
it O
is O
worth O
visiting O
this O
institution O
only O
because O
of O
the O
company B-TARGET
dish: I-TARGET
strawberries B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
soy I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

And O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
very O
delicious: O
fruits B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
caramel!!! I-TARGET

In O
other O
words, O
the O
mental O
institution... B-TARGET

I O
wanted O
to O
eat O
dinner O
with O
a O
girl, O
but O
we O
were O
not O
lucky O
- O
it O
was O
that O
day O
that O
they O
turned O
off O
the O
electricity. O

The O
girl O
serving O
us O
said O
that O
the O
kitchen O
could O
not O
offer O
us O
hot O
meals O
(as O
well O
as O
a O
few O
cold O
ones). O

Nothing O
hot O
we O
were O
able O
to O
order, O
according O
to O
this O
assessment O
the O
kitchen O
will O
not O
put, O
but O
what O
we O
ordered O
left O
no O
positive O
or O
negative O
impressions. O

We O
ordered O
a O
caesarean O
salad, O
a O
cheese O
plate, O
the O
girl O
took O
a O
glass O
of O
Bardo O
wine, O
and O
I O
took O
a O
lemonade O
as O
I O
was O
driving. O

Very O
funny O
looked O
like O
the O
waitress O
brought O
the O
order O
poured O
me O
into O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
lemonade O
from O
a O
bottle O
:) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
I O
liked O
it. O

It’s O
very O
romantic O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
and O
watch O
the O
channel. O

Probably, O
because O
the O
channel O
can O
only O
see O
nothing, O
but O
as O
I O
wrote O
before, O
you O
can O
have O
fun O
contemplating O
the O
students O
of O
the O
evening O
department O
of O
the O
finek. O

Now O
winter O
and O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
was O
quite O
cold O
so O
the O
girl O
was O
very O
frozen. O

There O
is O
a O
chair O
on O
every O
chair, O
but O
they O
didn’t O
even O
save. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
our O
order O
was O
not O
large O
it O
was O
served O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
if O
not O
to O
say O
very O
long. O

It O
feels O
like O
they O
have O
grown O
a O
new O
grape O
during O
this O
time O
and O
have O
already O
made O
the O
proposed O
wine O
from O
it. O

Another O
feature O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
peaches. O

I O
hope O
to O
see O
here O
again O
when O
it O
will O
be O
warm O
in O
the O
street O
and O
when O
there O
will O
be O
light O
in O
the O
establishment. O

I O
visited O
this O
cafe O
today. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
special, O
but O
comfortable. O

There O
is O
quiet, O
calm O
music. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
is O
good. O

I O
ate O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
(in O
my O
opinion, O
it O
was O
called O
Linda) O
- O
delicious, O
but O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
was O
salted. O

And O
of O
course, O
after O
reading O
reviews O
about O
Napoleon, O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
it! O

Very O
delicious, O
cream B-TARGET
lean, O
gentle. O

Most O
importantly, O
it’s O
not O
as O
sweet O
as O
it O
is. O

In O
the O
menu O
a O
lot O
of O
desserts B-TARGET
(sweet B-TARGET
lovers O
will O
have O
something O
to O
choose O
from), O
you O
will O
have O
to O
try O
something O
else. O

Overall, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
and O
considering O
that O
it O
is O
a O
cafe, O
it O
is O
very O
even O
good. O

Yesterday O
we O
went O
to O
Tokyo, O
went O
from O
Mirage, O
first O
went O
to O
Eurasia... O
but O
good O
that O
there O
were O
no O
places! O

Remembering O
from O
the O
restaurant O
club O
that O
next O
is O
Tokyo, O
go O
there! O

I O
liked O
the O
large O
hall, B-TARGET
where O
there O
were O
many O
convenient O
seats O
on O
the O
couches, B-TARGET
behind O
which O
we O
were O
able O
to O
talk O
greatly, O
without O
noise O
and O
loud O
music. O

It O
appeared O
that O
the O
officers B-TARGET
themselves O
still O
wandered O
around O
the O
institution, O
5 O
minutes O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
menu. O

This O
is O
enough O
to O
look O
around.) O

Enough O
good O
environment. B-TARGET

We O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
price O
of O
2 O
for O
the O
price O
of O
1!!! O

But O
most O
importantly O
(compared O
to O
Eurasia) O
everything O
was O
very O
delicious!!! O

I O
ordered O
spicy O
soup B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood, I-TARGET
large O
portions, B-TARGET
spicy O
enough, O
liked O
it! O

Midi B-TARGET
under I-TARGET
the O
sauce, O
very O
good, O
resembled O
the O
midi O
from O
2 O
sticks. O

Chicken B-TARGET
filet I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
purple I-TARGET
- O
very O
beautifully O
decorated, O
filet B-TARGET
gentle O
and O
sufficient O
portions. B-TARGET
(if O
honestly O
surprised, O
I O
thought, O
since O
such O
an O
action O
is O
much O
less) O

I O
will O
not O
describe O
sushi, O
because O
it O
is O
different O
for O
the O
lover! O

I O
liked O
shrimp, B-TARGET
Philadelphia I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
vegetables. I-TARGET

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
great, O
so O
keep O
it!! O

There O
is O
a O
great O
desire O
to O
come O
back! O

Open O
one O
in O
the O
Lakes O
or O
somewhere O
nearby O
in O
the O
North))) O

A O
terrible O
service!! B-TARGET

Until O
now, O
I O
had O
a O
good O
impression O
of O
the O
bar, O
but O
the O
waitress O
we O
tried O
to O
order O
the O
table O
from O
was O
talking O
to O
me O
just O
disgustingly. O

When O
asked O
if O
they O
had O
non-smoking O
spaces, O
he O
bluntly O
stated O
that O
if O
we O
need O
non-smoking O
spaces, O
then O
you O
are O
in O
the O
cafe O
nearby, O
not O
to O
us! O

And O
he O
went O
away, O
although O
we O
have O
not O
finished O
contact O
with O
him O
yet!!! O

I O
will O
never O
go O
there O
again! O

A O
terrible O
place!! B-TARGET

I O
read O
all O
the O
reviews O
below O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
out O
and O
eat O
there O
with O
a O
girl. O

As O
it O
is O
supposed, O
called, O
ordered O
a O
table. O
asked O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
cozy. O

have O
arrived. O

I O
have O
reserved O
the O
best O
table O
for O
me. O

Interior B-TARGET
is O
cool. O

The O
Village. O

Sitting O
for O
another O
5 O
minutes. O

There O
is O
no O
menu. O

I O
caught O
the O
waitress. O

The O
menu O
was O
brought, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
ashes. B-TARGET

10-15 O
minutes O
later O
came O
to O
accept O
the O
order O
(already O
another O
waitress). B-TARGET

Accepted, O
15-20 O
minutes O
later O
brought O
the O
order. O

and... O

disappeared... O

There O
was O
no O
anshlag O
in O
the O
institution, O
but O
the O
feeling O
of O
not O
being O
remembered O
did O
not O
leave O
us. O
the B-TARGET
ash I-TARGET
(which O
we O
still O
had O
to O
ask) O
was O
brought O
to O
us O
for O
the O
whole O
evening!!! O

I O
have O
never O
changed!! O

Thro O
the O
evening, O
we O
played O
the O
game O
"Catch O
Me O
If O
You O
Can". O

In O
addition, O
when O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
suspect O
another O
waitress, B-TARGET
she O
refused O
to O
accept O
the O
order, O
as O
we O
were O
not O
her O
table. O
(truth O
called O
our O
waitress O
minutes O
after O
3). O

Asked O
for O
bills, O
paid, O
and O
don’t O
pay. O

I O
understand, O
of O
course, O
that O
the O
cups O
and O
all O
that, O
but O
their O
size O
I O
want O
to O
determine O
myself O
(the O
delivery O
was O
300 O
rubles). O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
surrender. O

The O
result. O

Interior B-TARGET
of O
10 O
points. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
7. O

Service B-TARGET
1 O
(or O
even O
zero) O

Because O
of O
this, O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
I O
will O
return O
there O
again. O
our O
account O
for O
two O
amounted O
to O
3700 O
rubles. O
- O
an O
alternative O
to O
the O
foam O
bar. O

Recommendation: O
Teach O
staff B-TARGET
to O
work O
at O
least O
normally! O

Last O
Sunday O
we O
looked O
into O
Metropolis O
unnoticed O
and O
quietly O
to O
celebrate O
the O
wedding O
anniversary. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
a O
surprise. O

As O
a O
rule, O
before O
visiting O
restaurants O
for O
the O
first O
time O
I O
try O
to O
get O
acquainted O
with O
them O
through O
websites, O
look O
at O
the O
menu, O
well O
what O
to O
understand O
where O
we O
are O
going O
and O
what O
to O
expect, O
both O
from O
the O
kitchen O
and O
from O
the O
pricing O
policy. O

So O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
first O
impression O
of O
the O
restaurant O
- O
despite O
the O
fairly O
democratic O
prices, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
perfectly O
made, O
there O
is O
an O
impression O
of O
expensive, O
maybe O
even O
luxury... O

I O
did O
not O
expect. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
polite, O
ranging O
from O
the O
girl B-TARGET
hostess I-TARGET
below O
to O
several O
waiters. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Interesting, O
literate O
(the O
dish O
is O
meant O
to O
eat) O

Taste O
qualities O
do O
not O
lag O
behind, O
for O
example, O
very O
liked O
chopped B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
gofras, I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
caviar I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
"chanty", I-TARGET
the O
fish B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
(I O
don't O
know O
whether O
the O
salt O
itself O
or O
not), O
the O
combination O
of O
ingredients B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

Beer B-TARGET
is O
good, O
I’t O
say O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city, O
but O
at O
the O
level O
(my O
personal O
subjective O
opinion) O
with O
the O
most O
delicious O
beer O
I’ve O
tried O
in O
Peterburg... O

I O
even O
left O
a O
little O
comment O
in O
a O
magical O
book. O

We O
will O
go O
there O
again O
soon O
for O
a O
more O
thorough O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
menu.) O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Without O
a O
special O
patch. O

Comfortable, B-TARGET
less I-TARGET
quiet, I-TARGET
has I-TARGET
to I-TARGET
rest. I-TARGET

Just O
like O
in O
Dacia. O

On O
the O
menu: O
the O
best O
steak B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
oil. I-TARGET

Salad B-TARGET
is O
almost O
nothing. O

Great O
dessert B-TARGET
with O
black. O

We O
were O
at O
the O
opening, O
we O
noticed O
this O
place. O

They O
came O
a O
few O
times O
when O
there O
was O
very O
little O
people. O

In O
this O
situation, O
10 O
can O
be O
placed. O

But O
when O
we O
came O
in O
the O
evening, O
and O
even O
the O
group O
of O
Ivanushka O
was O
speaking, O
here O
it O
got O
worse. O

The O
hall O
was O
full, O
but O
a O
couple O
of O
tables O
were O
empty, O
while O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
couldn’t O
cope, O
serving O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

With O
cocktails B-TARGET
trouble, O
margarita B-TARGET
strawberries, I-TARGET
not O
strawberries O
at O
all, O
but O
from O
syrup. O

For O
some O
reason, O
we O
included O
in O
the O
account O
what O
we O
did O
not O
order. O

But O
in O
principle, O
it O
didn’t O
spoil O
our O
mood, O
because O
everyone O
saved O
Ivanushka. O

The O
result: O
we O
liked O
it. O

I O
will O
definitely O
return O
to O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
like O
coming O
to O
friends, O
thanks O
to O
the O
warm O
attitude, O
and O
probably O
the O
chef. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday! O

The O
choice O
fell O
on O
Roll O
& O
Roll. O

They O
were O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

Excellent O
setting, B-TARGET
soft, O
cozy O
sofas, B-TARGET
good O
lighting B-TARGET
(does O
not O
stress) O

I O
ordered O
the O
table O
on O
Saturday O
morning. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
advised O
to O
pre-order, O
told O
the O
menu, O
advised O
the O
dishes. O

Serving B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
cooked O
deliciously. O

The B-TARGET
heat I-TARGET
arrived I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
time. I-TARGET

In O
general, O
the O
guys O
liked O
it. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
Andrew, O
he O
was O
very O
grateful, O
did O
not O
have O
to O
look O
for O
him O
and O
look. O

In O
terms O
of O
money, O
I O
was O
even O
pleasantly O
surprised O
- O
not O
so O
expensive. O

For O
6 O
people O
7500r. O

A O
great O
place. B-TARGET

Excellent O

My O

personal O
celebration. O

Pleasant O
interior B-TARGET
- O
very O
light O
on O

cozy. O

Servicing B-TARGET

Elphira) O
beautiful O
girl. O

had O
to O
cut O
off O
a O

of O
patch) O
immediately O
brought, O
clean O
pads, B-TARGET
changing B-TARGET
utensils, I-TARGET
very O
nice O
serving B-TARGET
of I-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
there O
is O
no O
shrimp B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
lambs I-TARGET
-but O
they O
just O
opened, O
I O
think O
the O
menu O
will O
grow! O
and O
from O
pork B-TARGET
I O
tried O
a O
piece O
from O
my O
husband O
- O
gently, O
juicy, O
for O
a O
hundred O
years O
I O
did O
not O
eat O
anything O
like O
this O
and O
not O
overdried O
as O
usual)))) O
Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
-the O
most O
delicious O
option O
for O
my O
whole O
life O
(and O
where O
I O
only O
Caesar O
did O
not O
try!) O
and O
very O
delicious O
quas.. B-TARGET
everything O
we O
ordered O
we O
liked, O
and O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
are O
both O
extremely O
delightful O
in O
food. O

I O
want O
this O
restaurant O
to O
grow O
and O
not O
break O
down. O

When O
we O
left, O
we O
got O
a O
map. O

Just O
don’t O
pick O
up O
the O
cards, O
so O
wait O
again O
and O
again! O

The O
wedding O
ceremony O
was O
held O
in O
this O
restaurant O
on O
05.08.2010. O

Very O
pleasant, O
comfortable O
and O
quiet O
environment. B-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
really O
family. O

Staff B-TARGET
very O
attentive, O
service B-TARGET
super!!! O

All O
the O
wishes O
are O
met!! O

They O
cook O
great! O

Very O
delicious O
meals, B-TARGET
all O
quality, O
perfectly O
cooked O
meat!!! B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
left O
a O
great O
impression!!! O

We O
were O
at O
the O
restaurant O
on O
April O
26. O

The O
situation B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

I O
liked O
the O
public B-TARGET
there. O

Foreigners O
and O
students O
were O
there. O

Different O
people O
and O
everyone O
was O
well O
received. B-TARGET

From O
the O
menu B-TARGET
everything O
tastes O
and O
sounds O
and O
looks. O

When O
they O
tried, O
they O
convinced O
themselves. O

Eat O
hachapuri. O
cheese O
suluguni, O
pork O
and O
salad O
from O
seafood. O

Everything O
is O
delicious. O

I O
liked O
cheese B-TARGET
more. O

Whether O
it’s O
because O
I O
was O
hungry O
or O
because O
it O
really O
tastes O
good. O

Drinking O
Georgian O
wine. O

Also O
not O
bad. O

The O
average O
account O
was O
very O
decent, O
but O
only O
because O
of O
the O
guilt. O

I O
find O
it O
a O
decent O
and O
inexpensive O
place. B-TARGET

Playing O
background O
music. O

Staff B-TARGET
polite O
and O
welcoming. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
romantic. O

They O
cook O
well. O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviews: O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
to O
each O
other. O

For O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the O
hotel, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
too O
dark O
and O
dull O
somewhere O
from O
the O
inside, O
the O
street O
is O
good, O
wooden B-TARGET
tables I-TARGET
and O
chairs B-TARGET
under I-TARGET
umbrellas, I-TARGET
fresh B-TARGET
air I-TARGET
- O
there O
we O
settled. O

The O
girls O
of O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
obviously O
do O
not O
understand O
their O
purpose, O
neither O
smiles, O
nor O
spots O
in O
the O
gaze, O
nor O
advice O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
dishes O
I O
have O
not O
seen. O

There O
was O
such O
a O
feeling O
that O
they O
were O
not O
happy O
that O
we O
came. O

Well, O
okay, O
I O
ask O
about O
the O
shale: O
"How O
long O
will O
it O
be O
done?" O
Answers O
"Yes, O
no, O
people O
are O
not O
many, O
not O
long" O
I O
order. O

Well, O
what O
if O
I O
didn’t O
lie O
to O
the O
shashik, O
it O
took O
me O
exactly O
an O
hour, O
if O
not O
more. O

I O
heard O
from O
my O
friends O
that O
the O
chicken O
is O
delicious. O

I O
absolutely O
didn’t O
like O
the O
dry O
meat, B-TARGET
but O
the O
red B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

The O
cold B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
“Lapin I-TARGET
Kulta” I-TARGET
was O
also O
delighted. O

In O
the O
rest, O
I O
did O
not O
like O
the O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood, I-TARGET
some O
" O
raw", O
something O
is O
missing O
in O
it, O
the O
pot B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
clear O
is O
also O
not O
what O
I O
wanted. O

We O
ask O
for O
cold O
wine, O
they O
say O
yes, O
bring O
almost O
not O
from O
under O
the O
heater. O

I O
liked O
ice B-TARGET
cream O
and O
green B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lemon. I-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
obsessive. O

They O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant O
and O
after O
a O
while O
go O
out O
to O
see O
if O
anyone O
needs O
anything. O

We O
wanted O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bill O
and O
already O
thought O
they O
seemed O
to O
be O
there.))) O

But O
in O
general O
we O
sat O
well, O
because O
the O
most O
important O
company!! O

We O
were O
a O
big O
company O
at O
your O
restaurant, O
celebrating O
your O
birthday!!!! O

I O
really O
liked O
your O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
great! O

I O
can O
say O
that O
everything O
was O
on O
the O
level, O
delicious O
food!!! B-TARGET

Very O
good O
music, B-TARGET
I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
musical O
option O
that O
suits O
everyone, O
and O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
helps O
to O
stay O
longer, O
especially O
if O
there O
is O
still O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

I O
will O
note O
the O
service B-TARGET
at O
a O
good O
level, O
a O
huge O
thank O
you O
to O
our O
waitress B-TARGET
Wusala!!!! O

The O
next O
birthday O
must O
be O
for O
you!!!!!!! O

I O
love O
you!!!!!!!!!!! O

In O
the O
first O
I O
write O
a O
review O
about O
the O
restaurant, O
because O
it O
is O
impossible O
not O
to O
write. O

The O
wedding O
was O
celebrated O
on O
August O
17 O
for O
45 O
people. O

We O
and O
our O
guests O
were O
delighted. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
varied, O
service B-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level!! O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
food, B-TARGET
so O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
we O
had O
everything O
left O
with O
us. O

But O
even O
more O
we O
liked O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters, O
they O
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
polite! O

Special O
thanks O
to O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Vladimir, O
for O
his O
patience O
and O
care, O
serving O
our O
elderly O
relatives. O

They O
still O
remember O
you O
with O
good O
words.) O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
celebration! O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
my O
acquaintances! O

I O
really O
like O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Like O
many O
years O
ago, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
at O
a O
high O
level. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
so O
smiling O
and O
attentive, O
always O
clarify O
if O
everything O
liked, O
if O
you O
need O
something O
else O
and O
if O
you O
ask O
- O
I O
will O
recommend O
something. O

We O
serve O
quickly O
and O
unobtrusively. O

The O
interior, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
on O
the O
amateur, O
to O
my O
taste O
not O
very, O
I O
like O
more O
cozy O
places. O

But O
here O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
really O
good O
and O
for O
such O
wonderful O
service B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
I O
am O
ready O
to O
come O
back O
again O
and O
again. O

The O
last O
time O
I O
took O
a O
salad O
with O
Mozzarella O
and O
chamomile. O

Very O
delicious O
salad. B-TARGET

A O
chicken B-TARGET
file I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
just O
lick O
your O
fingers. O

The O
cheese O
is O
roasted O
in O
luncheon, O
and O
the O
delicate O
chicken B-TARGET
meat O
perfectly O
complements O
the O
sweet O
orange B-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

I O
highly O
recommend. O

A O
friend O
ordered O
a O
calf B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
bone O
and O
was O
also O
very O
pleased. O

I O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
Las O
Torres, O
really O
a O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
have O
a O
very O
delicious O
dinner O
and O
have O
a O
pleasant O
time. O

The O
only O
place B-TARGET
near O
the O
house O
that O
works O
until O
6 O
in O
the O
morning, O
and O
where O
you O
do O
not O
need O
to O
go O
by O
car. O

There O
is O
a O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room. I-TARGET

Lots O
of O
tables B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sofas. I-TARGET

They O
always O
meet O
and O
go O
to O
the O
table. O

Advice O
when O
choosing O
a O
meal. O

Constantly O
different O
promotions, O
on O
weekdays, O
for O
example, O
up O
to O
18 O
hours, O
2 O
meals O
at O
the O
price O
of O
1. O

There O
is O
also O
an O
Italian O
menu, O
but O
you O
haven’t O
tried O
it O
yet. O

The O
only O
minus O
can O
bring O
the O
soup O
and O
rolls O
at O
once, O
if O
the O
rolls O
are O
hot, O
then O
they O
have O
time O
to O
cool. O

Service B-TARGET
in O
9 O
out O
of O
10 O
cases O
is O
good. O

Delivery B-TARGET
is O
also O
not O
bad, O
there O
was O
never O
such O
a O
thing O
that O
something O
was O
not O
or O
not. O

It O
is O
always O
delivered O
at O
the O
agreed O
time. O

In O
our O
area, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
decent O
places. B-TARGET

Very O
pleasant O
place. B-TARGET

They O
sat O
there O
with O
a O
young O
man O
and O
took O
a O
pizza O
for O
two. O

I O
don't O
remember O
what O
it O
was O
called, O
but O
I O
remember O
that O
it O
was O
a O
mushroom. O

Enjoyable O
delicious O
and O
pasta, B-TARGET
as O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
correctly O
suggested, O
not O
thin, O
not O
thick, O
but O
right! O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
delicious, O
very O
well O
felt O
white O
mushrooms, O
but O
seemed O
a O
little O
fresh, O
so O
9. O

The O
design B-TARGET
is O
very O
wellined, O
a O
fairly O
light O
room O
for O
non-smokers O
and O
a O
darker O
room O
for O
smokers. O

We O
sat O
in O
a O
non-smoking O
window, O
very O
cozy O
and O
light O
tones B-TARGET
of O
the O
room O
raise O
the O
mood. O

I O
have O
seen O
bad O
feedback O
about O
the O
staff. O

On O
the O
contrary, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
praise. O

The O
administrator B-TARGET
was O
a O
very O
nice O
girl, O
a O
friendly O
face, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
approached O
quickly, O
suggested O
the O
menu. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
restaurant! B-TARGET

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
have O
not O
tried O
the O
delicious O
Lemonchello B-TARGET
drink, O
I O
recommend O
trying O
it! O

I O
was O
delighted, O
really O
tried O
the O
cream B-TARGET
limoncello. I-TARGET

In O
the O
restaurant O
it O
costs O
140 O
rubles O
for O
50g, O
which O
is O
quite O
an O
acceptable O
price O
for O
this O
drink! B-TARGET

thank O
you! O

Long O
thought O
where O
to O
go O
to O
celebrate O
the O
anniversary O
of O
my O
husband’s O
parents. O

I O
wanted O
seafood, O
a O
new O
interesting O
interior. O

Of O
all O
(not O
very O
large) O
list O
of O
new O
establishments O
of O
this O
kind O
was O
chosen O
restaurant O
"Massmidia". O
I O
love O
seafood. O
but O
unfortunately O
we O
do O
not O
have O
so O
many O
places O
where O
they O
can O
offer O
such O
a O
variety O
of O
Midi. O

And O
mostly O
they O
were O
all O
gone O
along O
and O
over. O

My O
parents O
are O
great O
lovers O
of O
seafood. O

The O
most O
important O
thing O
for O
us O
is O
that O
they O
are O
satisfied. O

And O
we O
(and O
the O
staff O
of O
the O
restaurant) B-TARGET
did O
it. O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
created O
a O
great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
for O
our O
small O
family O
holiday. O

I O
was O
with O
a O
friend O
at O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
my O
birthday O
on O
June O
10th! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful!! O

It O
is O
super!! O

Amazing O
ceilings B-TARGET
in O
the O
non-smoking O
room...comfortable O
sofas B-TARGET
in O
the O
light O
hall. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
delicious. O

Amazing O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crab I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
catch. I-TARGET

Interesting O
combination O
of O
crab B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
pears. I-TARGET

And O
an O
unusual O
cuddled O
duck O
and O
celery. O

Very O
delicious O
hot B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
- O
dorado B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables!!! I-TARGET

I O
recommend O
all O
fish B-TARGET
lovers!! O

At O
the O
end O
of O
our O
dessert... O

Soup O
of O
fresh O
strawberries!! O

Very O
very O
much!! O

Service B-TARGET
was O
great. O

We O
met O
a O
girl O
with O
huge O
eyes O
and O
a O
beautiful O
dress. O

very O
kindly O
and O
kindly O
communicated O
with O
us, O
sat O
us O
at O
the O
table O
with O
couches, O
brought O
water, O
helped O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
wine... O

Everything O
is O
very O
unobtrusive O
and O
professional! O

Impressions O
are O
the O
most O
pleasant... O

Everything O
was O
great!! O

We O
will O
go O
back O
to O
this O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
many O
times. O

I O
celebrated O
my O
birthday O
with O
a O
small O
company. O

EVERYTHING O
liked O
it, O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
non-obsessive, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
in O
white O
who O
served O
us, O
very O
attentive, O
advised O
with O
what O
sauces, O
offered O
tea, O
warned O
that O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
large O
(so O
it O
turned O
out, O
we O
eventually O
didn't O
even O
eat O
everything). O

I O
saw O
that O
the O
owner O
was O
going O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
I O
looked, O
apparently, O
if O
the O
guests O
were O
satisfied. O

Besides O
us, O
there O
were O
several O
other O
companies. O

The O
rice B-TARGET
was O
well O
made, O
the O
strawberries B-TARGET
too, O
all O
spicy O
in O
moderation, O
nothing O
more O
than O
spicy O
or O
salty. O

The B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
is O
hot O
like O
the O
oven. O

No O
one O
was O
standing O
over O
our O
soul, O
what O
is O
called, O
the O
plate O
was O
not O
taken O
out O
of O
our O
hands. O

We O
sat O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
no O
one O
hurried O
us O
anywhere. O

I O
wanted O
to O
try O
the O
dessert O
"Indian O
cheesecake" O
but O
it O
didn't O
come O
in, O
I'll O
leave O
it O
for O
the O
next O
time O
(no O
doubt O
the O
next O
time O
is O
not O
beyond O
the O
mountains). O

Impressions O
are O
very O
pleasant! O

Once O
I O
went O
to O
work, O
I O
looked O
out O
the O
window: O
shops, O
crossroads, O
park... O
I O
saw O
a O
sign O
"...we O
opened O
up!" O
or O
something O
like O
that. O

Looking O
around, O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
open O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Palki" I-TARGET
of O
Japanese O
and O
Italian O
cuisine, O
well, O
I O
think O
I O
will O
go... O
better O
not O
to O
go. O

First, O
no O
one O
met, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
area. O

The O
room O
was O
empty, O
there O
were O
no O
guests. O

I O
picked O
a O
table O
at O
the O
window, O
sat O
down, O
waiting O
for O
the O
menu. O

Quite O
quickly O
I O
was O
noticed, O
and O
with O
a O
smile O
in O
the O
whole O
mouth... O
no... O
they O
did O
not O
submit O
the O
menu, O
but O
asked O
to O
sit O
down, O
as O
this O
table O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
for O
large O
companies O
(it O
is O
an O
hour O
or O
a O
day O
in O
the O
day!), O
Well, O
okay. O

Secondly, O
with O
the O
choice O
did O
not O
help, O
I O
ordered O
myself. O

And O
I O
ordered O
a O
paste O
with O
salmon, O
a O
"Greek" O
salad O
and O
a O
cocktail. O

Both O
meals O
were O
served O
at O
the O
same O
time O
without O
asking O
me. O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
not O
delicious O
and O
salted, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
is O
so O
much O
(too O
much O
oil). B-TARGET

Music B-TARGET
is O
incomprehensible O
and O
blatant, O
not O
comfortable O
furniture, B-TARGET
and O
the O
ashes B-TARGET
must O
be O
asked. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
the O
"bars" O
need O
to O
be O
renamed O
in O
a O
cafe, O
as O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
far O
away O
and O
not O
even O
visible. O
or O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
service, I-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
halls O
and, O
of O
course, O
the O
quality O
of O
cooking O
and O
serving O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

I O
agree O
with O
the O
positive O
feedback. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
in O
the O
full O
sense O
of O
the O
word, O
but O
a O
great O
cafe B-TARGET
with O
delicious O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
moderate O
prices. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are I-TARGET
large, O
the O
first O
time O
taken O
as O
it O
should O
be: O
salad, O
the O
first. O
the O
second O
and O
compot O
barely O
rolled O
out O
of O
the O
table. O

A O
great O
selection O
of O
second B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
delicious O
soups, B-TARGET
baking B-TARGET
also O
liked. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
quite O
consistent O
with O
the O
status, O
the O
only O
minus O
- O
indeed, O
it O
is O
unclear O
which O
of O
the O
rooms B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
non-smokers, I-TARGET
whether O
they O
smoke O
everywhere, O
or O
whether O
the O
outlet B-TARGET
works O
poorly. O

In O
general, O
we O
went O
there O
for O
lunch O
once O
a O
week O
when O
we O
were O
at O
work O
in O
those O
areas. O

And O
we O
realized O
that O
we O
are O
already O
looking O
forward O
to O
this O
day! O

The O
restaurant O
is O
not O
large, O
by O
the O
environment O
I O
realized O
that O
there O
are O
regular O
customers.) O

The B-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
made O
wonderful O
desserts B-TARGET
Tiramisu I-TARGET
)))))) O

All O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
served O
on O
large O
and O
heavy O
plates B-TARGET
not O
in O
the O
usual O
form)))))) O

This O
restaurant O
was O
the O
first O
among O
the O
dozen O
best O
Japanese, O
but O
sushi O
I O
ate O
and O
was O
more O
delicious. O

They O
are, O
of O
course, O
large O
and O
juicy, O
but O
the O
same O
in O
everything O
else O
and O
everywhere, O
and O
there O
is O
almost O
no O
choice O
( O

menu O
without O
pictures, O
and O
everyone O
is O
so O
used O
to O
choosing O
dishes O
according O
to O
them))))) O

So O
quiet O
and O
comfortable. O

This O
is O
a O
theme O
cafe O
rather O
than O
a O
restaurant. O

Salk B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
large, O
but O
when O
people O
are O
not O
very O
normal. O

There O
are O
no O
separate O
areas B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
smokers I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
non-smokers. I-TARGET

Overall, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
inexpensive O
but O
interesting. O

Enjoyed O
the O
menu B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Khokhlyacki, I-TARGET
thematic B-TARGET
clothes I-TARGET
of O
staff O
/ O
music. B-TARGET

A O
girl O
from O
our O
modest O
company O
received O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
glass O
of O
wine B-TARGET
(very O
liked, O
ordered O
again). O

Service B-TARGET
is O
generally O
fast O
and O
high O
quality. O

In O
principle, O
we O
did O
not O
order O
much, O
but O
from O
what O
was O
ordered O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
fresh, O
quality. O

Plus O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
quite O
understandable O
(I O
would O
say O
a O
little O
at O
home, O
without O
any O
pyjong O
delicacies). O

The O
price O
in O
this O
institution O
is O
democratic: O
a O
pot O
of O
salt O
200 O
r., O
Nemirov O
80 O

r., O
a O

don't O
remember O
what)-150 O

Cigarettes O

delicious O

Unfortunately, O
I O
am O
very O
rarely O
in O
this O
area, O
so O
the O
next O
time O
I O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
go O
soon, O
and O
so O
occasionally O
I O
think O
I O
visited O
this O
place. O

On O
April O
29 O
we O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
in O
Amulet. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
delighted O
us O
and O
our O
guests. O

Everything O
was O
very O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
menu O
took O
1500 O
per O
person, O
everyone O
was O
enough, O
everything O
that O
was O
left O
we O
packed. O

I O
really O
liked O
a O
hot O
snack O
- O
a O
chicken B-TARGET
filet I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
a O
tempur, O
from O
the O
hot O
main O
dish O
I O
want O
to O
mark O
a O
calf B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
fungal I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
- O
very O
gentle O
and O
delicious! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
wonderful, O
the O
girls B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
good O
after O
the O
holiday O
helped O
pack O
not O
only O
the O
food O
but O
also O
all O
the O
flowers O
that O
we O
gave! O

The O
new O
hall B-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful O
- O
bright, O
lots O
of O
space, O
the B-TARGET
lights I-TARGET
are O
great! O

We O
thank O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Liliane O
and O
the O
whole O
team B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O
wonderful O
place! O
next O
time O
we O
know O
where O
to O
go O
and O
which O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
to O
friends. O

Sergey O
and O
Vera O
Khmelkovy O

I O
had O
lunch O
at O
Friends O
several O
times. O

I O
was O
pleased O
every O
time!) O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
name O
the O
restaurant, O
but O
the O
category O
of O
the O
cafe, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
the O
institution O
is O
superior O
- O
rather O
- O
a O
cozy, O
small O
corner O
of O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine!!! I-TARGET

Warm O
light O
tones, B-TARGET
cozy O
sofas, B-TARGET
nobly O
aged O
chairs B-TARGET
create O
comfort, O
good O
serving, B-TARGET
appliances B-TARGET
- O
all O
liked. O

A O
decent O
service. B-TARGET

Of O
course, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
the O
main O
plus. O

Several O
times O
was O
at O
a O
business O
lunch, O
salad, O
soup, O
hot, O
drink, O
and O
there O
are O
several O
options O
for O
each O
position. B-TARGET

I O
would O
like O
to O
note O
the O
help O
of O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
in O
choosing O
for O
me O
and O
replacing O
some O
dishes O
with O
vegetarian O
(I O
don’t O
eat O
meat). O

I O
tried O
the O
paste, B-TARGET
it O
is O
now O
a O
lot O
where O
it O
is O
cooked, O
but O
there O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
have O
tried! O
juicy, O
fragrance, O
delicious O
and O
filling. O

In O
the O
nearest O
micro O
district O
- O
for O
me O
one O
of O
the O
best O
establishments!!! O

On O
November O
27, O
she O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
at O
the O
Saltan O
restaurant O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
in O
the O
hall O
where O
aquariums O
and O
live O
music. O

I O
and O
all O
my O
guests, O
and O
they O
were O
11 O
people, O
unanimously O
liked O
the O
establishment. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
cleverly O
do O
their O
job O
on O
all O
100. O

Very O
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
great O
music, B-TARGET
show B-TARGET
program. I-TARGET

The O
belly B-TARGET
dance I-TARGET
in O
very O
good O
performance. O

Our O
company O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
to O
celebrate O
the O
holidays O
more O
than O
once O
and O
just O
have O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
would O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
my O
friends. O

With O
respect O
Natalia. O

I O
want O
to O
share O
my O
impressions O
of O
visiting O
this O
recently O
opened O
restaurant O
on O
my O
favorite O
Rubinstein O
street O
restaurant. O

I O
visited O
him O
twice O
a O
day O
for O
business O
lunch. O

So, O
the O
first O
visit O
- O
at O
the O
entrance O
polite O
welcomed, O
planted, O
quickly O
served O
and O
there O
were O
only O
two O
questions O
about O
the O
food: O
it O
was O
salted O
soup B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
and O
the O
absence O
of O
a O
plate O
of O
bread, B-TARGET
and O
so O
the O
salad B-TARGET
and O
chicken B-TARGET
puddle I-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

But O
the O
second O
time O
I O
had O
a O
business O
meeting O
at O
a O
business O
lunch, O
I O
was O
unexpectedly O
disappointed. O

And O
here O
it O
was O
almost O
not O
as O
expected. O

After O
ordering O
as O
an O
aperitif O
a O
glass O
of O
white B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
I O
got O
it O
warm O
and O
uncooled O
and O
my O
glass O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
refrigerator...somebody O
drank, O
and O
I O
waited O
for O
my O
glass, O
asking O
for O
a O
business O
lunch, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
said O
that O
we O
would O
be O
given O
a O
bonus O
when O
ordering O
wine O
and O
we O
began O
to O
wait...but O
by O
that O
time O
the O
ordered O
borst B-TARGET
had O
already O
cooled, O
which, O
by O
the O
way, O
was O
unpleasant. O

but O
here O
is O
hot B-TARGET
and O
dessert B-TARGET
/ O
we O
ordered O
pancakes B-TARGET
/ O
were O
delicious, O
and O
the O
brusquets B-TARGET
were O
also O
delicious. O

Everything O
was O
polite O
and O
careful. O

Not O
everything O
is O
bad, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
for O
a O
restaurant. B-TARGET

But O
God O
loves O
the O
three, O
I O
will O
come O
again, O
maybe O
there O
is O
something O
to O
praise O
for. O

Peter’s O
birthday O
was O
celebrated O
on O
April O
5. O

From O
the O
first O
minute O
we O
were O
delighted O
by O
the O
staff! B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
waiters, B-TARGET
bartenders B-TARGET
and O
especially O
would O
like O
to O
note O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Elena! O

We O
were O
immediately O
offered O
to O
drink O
tea O
or O
coffee O
(at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
establishment) B-TARGET
that O
not O
all O
restaurants B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
city O
offer! O

There O
were O
about O
30 O
guests O
at O
the O
event, O
Elena O
explained O
to O
us O
very O
easily O
what O
is O
included O
in O
the O
banquet O
menu, O
what O
is O
worth O
putting O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
what O
can O
be O
refused. O

It O
also O
helped O
to O
calculate O
how O
much O
and O
what O
alcohol O
we O
need O
to O
buy O
for O
our O
event! O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
banquet O
from O
the O
first O
second O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
felt O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
holiday O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
smiled O
and O
congratulated! O
it O
was O
very O
pleasant!=) O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
unbeatable, O
all O
the O
guests O
ate O
"until O
the O
fall" O
everything O
was O
very O
delicious! O
excellent O
samga B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill O
and O
hatchapuri! B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
celebration O
of O
the O
soul O
and O
stomach!!!=) O

I O
recommend O
to O
everyone O
who O
has O
not O
been O
there, O
must O
come, O
and O
who O
has O
been, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
worth O
repeating!=) O

I O
became O
a O
regular O
visitor... O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
get O
into O
the O
center, O
I O
always O
come O
in, O
at O
least O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee... O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone!! O

Celebrate O
a O
birthday O
with O
friends. O

We O
were O
here O
in O
the O
first. O

The O
feelings O
of O
the O
evening O
are O
just O
wonderful! O

A O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
polite O
fast O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
stunning O
cuisine. B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
above O
all O
praise. O

All O
delicious, O
well O
prepared, O
well O
served. O

Very O
comfortable O
and O
comfortable. O

I O
want O
to O
thank O
you O
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone! O

R.S. O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
girls. O

I O
visited O
with O
my O
friends O
in O
Malibu. O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
rumors, O
good O
and O
bad, O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
check O
it O
all O
myself. O

Immediately O
throws O
into O
the O
galaxy, O
the O
entrance, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
beautiful, O
it O
is O
already O
pleasant. O

Inside, O
the O
design, B-TARGET
"stitched O
to O
the O
holes", O
there O
were O
no O
waiters B-TARGET
in O
the O
hall O
at O
all, O
the O
bartender O
was O
sitting O
behind O
the O
bench O
and O
reading O
a O
book, O
apparently O
customers O
come O
here O
exclusively O
on O
weekends. O

Sitting O
at O
the O
table, O
the O
ashes B-TARGET
was O
almost O
full. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
clearly O
could O
not O
explain O
what O
was O
in O
the O
menu, O
so O
we O
ordered O
everything O
usual, O
which O
we O
already O
know. O

25 O
minutes O
of O
cooking, O
for O
an O
empty O
establishment, O
it O
is O
a O
long O
time. O

In O
general, O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

The O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
but O
judging O
by O
the O
price O
should O
be O
better. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
cocktails, O
but O
they O
are O
quite O
expensive O
for O
a O
new O
place, O
"Daikiri O
290r", O
usually O
new O
establishments, O
usually O
not O
hold O
high O
prices O
for O
a O
while, O
and O
here O
it O
is O
immediately O
expensive. O

In O
general, O
I O
will O
summarize, O
the O
service B-TARGET
for O
3-, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
for O
4, O
even O
rather O
4-, O
the O
design B-TARGET
for O
4, O
all O
beautiful, O
but O
banal, O
lacks O
some O
excellence. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
medium, O
maybe O
it O
will O
be O
better O
or O
worse, O
until O
it O
is O
clear. O

I O
accidentally O
saw O
this O
restaurant O
at O
Restaurant O
Club, O
decided O
to O
go O
out O
for O
lunch O
with O
a O
friend, O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
local O
business O
lunch. O

The O
choice O
is O
very O
even O
not O
bad, O
at O
a O
fairly O
low O
price O
(such O
as O
330 O
rubles, O
including O
drinks). O

So O
my O
choice O
fell O
on O
a O
salad O
with O
red O
fish O
and O
vegetables, O
spicy O
with O
mayonnaise O
(the O
fish B-TARGET
in O
the O
salad O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
delicious, O
the O
portion B-TARGET
is O
small), O
cream O
soup O
from O
champignons O
with O
grannies O
(the O
soup B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
only O
minus O
- O
I O
would O
serve O
grannies B-TARGET
separately, O
I O
don't O
like O
when O
they O
become O
soft O
and O
the O
salt B-TARGET
would O
be O
less), O
baked O
pork O
with O
mushrooms O
and O
potatoes O
( O
pork B-TARGET
juicy, O
potatoes B-TARGET
in O
the O
countryside O
were O
dry, O
to O
this O
dish O
I O
would O
add O
some O
sauce, O
liked O
the O
serving B-TARGET
- O
on O
a B-TARGET
bowl I-TARGET
). O

My O
friend O
was O
solidary O
with O
me O
in O
everything O
except O
the O
hot O
meal. O

Her O
choice O
fell O
on O
chicken O
breasts-grill O
+ O
peanut O
beans O
in O
tomato O
sauce O
(the O
breasts B-TARGET
were O
dry, O
and O
the O
garment B-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
liked). O

Service B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
non-obsessive. O

At O
the O
entrance O
is O
a O
nice O
man: B-TARGET
polite, O
courteous. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
usual, O
in O
principle, O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
for O
lunch, O
but O
no O
more. O

I O
can O
write O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
endlessly, O
I O
want O
to O
come O
to O
it O
again O
and O
again, O
and O
no O
matter O
with O
whom, O
when O
and O
for O
what O
reason. O

Winter O
is O
like O
a O
magnet. O

In O
the O
daytime O
- O
it O
is O
a O
pleasant O
lunch, B-TARGET
in O
the O
evening O
- O
delicious O
dinners, O
flowing O
smoothly O
into O
nighttime O
sessions, O
karaoke O
and O
dances. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
much O
like, O
only O
it O
would O
be O
time O
to O
do O
repairs, O
I O
think O
most O
visitors O
would O
be O
in O
favor O
of O
this O
idea, O
although O
the O
old O
interior, B-TARGET
a O
little O
shredded O
furniture B-TARGET
do O
not O
prevent O
coming O
here O
again O
and O
again, O
because O
the O
main O
atmosphere!! B-TARGET

Summer B-TARGET
is O
very O
good: O
a O
good O
and O
delicious O
grill B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
(especially O
fish), B-TARGET
a O
standard O
selection O
of O
salads, B-TARGET
a O
large O
selection O
of O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
(the O
most O
delicious O
Geisha B-TARGET
and O
baked O
Kyoto), B-TARGET
a O
worthy O
cocktail B-TARGET
card, I-TARGET
only O
here O
long, O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
and O
strawberry B-TARGET
margarita I-TARGET
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
to O
anyone, O
disgusting! O

But O
it O
doesn’t O
have O
to O
be O
perfect!! O

I O
only O
smoke O
Kalyan B-TARGET
here, O
I O
think O
it’s O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city. O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
of O
this O
establishment O
is O
the O
service: B-TARGET
girls B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
hostess O
with O
a O
missing O
look, O
imagine O
themselves O
hostesses O
of O
the O
establishment, O
there O
are O
many O
waiters, B-TARGET
and O
there O
is O
little O
trouble. O

On O
the O
weekend, O
especially O
closer O
to O
the O
night, O
orders O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time, O
the O
bill O
will O
not O
wait, O
and O
if O
you O
still O
want O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
delivery, O
you O
can O
sit O
until O
the O
morning. O

I O
still O
thank O
my O
friend O
for O
opening O
this O
place B-TARGET
for O
me O
a O
year O
ago. O

Since O
then, O
every O
trip O
to O
the O
Wave B-TARGET
has O
provided O
me O
with O
a O
great O
mood. O

Before O
we O
go O
to O
the O
main O
thing, O
the O
kitchen, O
I O
will O
say O
a O
few O
words O
about O
the O
interior, O
the O
service O
and O
the O
restaurant O
in O
general. O

There O
is O
always O
a O
pleasant O
and O
benevolent O
atmosphere: B-TARGET
friendly O
girls B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the O
hostess, O
helpful O
waitresses B-TARGET
(but O
sometimes O
not O
very), O
soft O
leather O
sofas, B-TARGET
paintings O
of O
contemporary O
artists O
on O
sale. O

The O
wave B-TARGET
is O
a O
place O
where O
in O
the O
day-to-day, O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
hide O
from O
the O
city's O
noise O
and O
turmoil. O

But O
it’t O
matter O
if O
there O
wasn’t O
a O
great O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Caesari B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
to O
try, O
the O
Greek B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
surprised O
me O
very O
much, O
I O
didn't O
think O
that O
such O
a O
"sweet" O
meal O
can O
be O
cooked O
so O
delicious. O

Fetuchi B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
just O
melt O
in O
the O
mouth, O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crabs I-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
sauce O
I O
would O
add O
a O
little O
more O
to O
make O
the O
taste O
softer. O

Sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls...this B-TARGET
is O
a O
separate O
topic, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
so O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city, O
no O
Ginza O
can O
compare. O

Moreover, O
absolutely O
all O
tasty, O
the O
most O
favorite: O
Kyoto B-TARGET
roll, I-TARGET
a O
roll B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sharp I-TARGET
salmon. I-TARGET

As O
for O
desserts, O
I O
feel O
more O
than O
calm O
about O
them, O
but O
the O
Napoleon B-TARGET
cake O
and O
the O
Philadelphia B-TARGET
cheesecake, I-TARGET
the O
fruit B-TARGET
tar-tar I-TARGET
in O
a O
positive O
way O
changed O
my O
attitude O
to O
desserts. O

We O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
with O
my O
wife O
the O
anniversary O
of O
our O
wedding O
in O
Shabu-Shabu. O

When O
we O
arrived, O
there O
were O
hardly O
any O
visitors O
and O
we O
sat O
in O
a O
small O
room. O

It O
was O
quiet O
and O
quiet O
until O
the O
company O
of O
four O
people O
arrived. O

They O
seemed O
to O
be O
sitting O
at O
our O
table, O
so O
little O
space O
there. O

There O
were O
not O
four O
tables O
in O
this O
room, O
but O
two. O

We O
liked O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
at O
this O
place. O

All O
meals B-TARGET
are O
made O
from O
fresh O
foods. B-TARGET

Rolls B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
acne I-TARGET
impressed O
the O
most, O
next O
time O
we O
will O
try O
others. O

And O
we O
also O
ordered O
the O
company O
dish O
Shabu-Shabu O
(Japanese O
foundation) O

The O
most O
delicious O
ingredient B-TARGET
is O
marble B-TARGET
meat, I-TARGET
just O
lick O
your O
fingers. O

The O
bouillon B-TARGET
was O
just O
a O
bit O
salted. O

The O
impressions O
remained O
the O
most O
pleasant, O
we O
will O
come O
in O
again. O

After O
visiting O
the O
cinema O
decided O
with O
my O
husband O
and O
friends O
to O
go O
for O
lunch O
at O
the O
restaurant O
"Gostina". O

With O
my O
husband O
we O
ordered O
Gaspacho O
and O
Solyanka, O
from O
hot O
dishes O
- O
Chicken O
tobacco O
with O
vegetables O
grill O
and O
Sudaka, O
baked O
with O
sauce O
under O
cheese. O

Gaspacho B-TARGET
was O
too O
spicy, O
although O
I O
asked O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
to O
make O
the O
dish O
not O
spicy. O

The O
chicken B-TARGET
of O
tobacco O
was O
delicious, O
but O
as O
for O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
of O
the O
grill, O
it O
was O
no O
grill, O
but O
baked O
in O
large O
amounts O
of O
oil, B-TARGET
strawberries, I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Bulgarian I-TARGET
pepper, I-TARGET
terribly O
unfavourable. O

My O
husband O
didn't O
like O
the O
dish O
either, O
the O
dish B-TARGET
seemed O
to O
be O
quite O
fat. O

Friends O
ordered O
a O
shale B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
lamb, I-TARGET
but O
the O
shale O
(the O
beef O
cooked O
on O
the O
grill) O
didn't O
look O
like O
it O
at O
all. O

They O
also O
ordered O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
and O
regretted O
it, O
after O
which O
the O
head O
fell O
ill O
(except O
for O
drinking O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
no O
alcohol O
was O
consumed O
on O
that O
day). O

We O
ordered O
a O
basket O
of O
bread O
on O
four O
with O
different O
types O
of O
bread, O
almost O
all O
the O
bread B-TARGET
was O
warm, O
soft O
and O
tasty, O
but O
the O
pieces O
of O
white B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
were O
strongly O
tasting B-TARGET
mold. I-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
nice, O
quite O
cozy, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
average. O

We O
would O
not O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
anymore, O
as O
we O
did O
not O
like O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
in O
general. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
write O
is O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
just O
disgusting! O

I O
went O
to O
you O
three O
times O
(all O
three O
at O
the O
Pioneer), O
all O
three O
times O
I O
stood O
at O
the O
door O
for O
ten O
minutes O
waiting O
for O
me O
to O
be O
noticed, O
another O
ten O
times O
until O
they O
brought O
the O
menu... O

Well O
about O
how O
long O
I O
waited O
for O
my O
order O
to O
be O
accepted... O
I’m O
still O
silent!!! O

I O
would O
have O
understood O
this O
perfectly O
if O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
besides O
me O
there O
were O
only O
three O
people O
sitting. O

All O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
with O
faces O
as O
if O
they O
just O
want O
to O
destroy O
me. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
the O
horror O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
are O
very O
not O
bad, O
very O
comfortable O
and O
cozy O
sofas, B-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
your O
wonderful O
action, O
which O
to O
my O
pleasant O
surprise O
works O
on O
all O
menus, O
and O
not O
only O
on O
sushi O
/ O
rolls!!! O

If O
you O
work O
with O
the O
staff, O
you O
will O
have O
a O
wonderful O
place...!!! O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
changing O
to O
come O
to O
you O
again! O

My O
family O
loves O
to O
be O
in O
this O
cafe. B-TARGET

Enjoy O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
availability O
of O
children's B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
children's B-TARGET
chairs. I-TARGET

Everything O
is O
delicious O
and O
interesting. O

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
available O
for O
relaxation. O

I O
like O
the O
service. B-TARGET

We O
always O
book O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
served O
professionally, O
but O
without O
excessive O
diligence. O

It O
makes O
the O
impression O
that O
you O
are O
not O
served, O
but O
cared O
for. O

About O
any O
dish O
with O
great O
pleasure O
everyone O
will O
tell O
and O
advise O
the O
best. O

Excess O
cleaning O
from O
the O
table O
is O
not O
only O
specifically O
your O
waitress, B-TARGET
but O
also O
any O
other. O

And O
if O
you O
drink O
the O
company O
tea O
with O
cake, O
then O
you O
will O
try O
to O
bring O
all O
several O
waiters B-TARGET
at O
the O
same O
time. O

It’s O
very O
convenient O
and O
pleasant O
to O
drink O
tea O
together, O
instead O
of O
waiting O
for O
others O
to O
bring O
a O
dessert. O

And O
no O
one O
will O
look O
at O
you O
expecting O
a O
quick O
recovery O
after O
you’ve O
all O
eaten. O

All O
for O
pleasure O
and O
pleasure. O

We O
visit O
the O
cafe O
once O
a O
week O
with O
the O
whole O
family O
exclusively O
to O
enjoy O
delicious O
and O
varied O
food B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
anyone, O
because O
I O
myself O
closely! O

On O
Saturday O
night O
there O
are O
almost O
no O
places O
in O
the O
non-smoking O
area. O

In O
September, O
they O
celebrated O
a O
wedding O
in O
Dubrovnik. O

Every O
time O
we O
met O
with O
the O
host, O
he O
was O
very O
kind, O
welcoming O
and O
assured O
us O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
wonderful! O

Everything O
was O
agreed O
in O
advance, O
but O
we O
decided O
an O
hour O
before O
the O
banquet O
began O
to O
send O
two O
guests O
to O
the O
cafe O
to O
check O
the O
preparations, O
about O
which O
the O
host O
was O
warned! O

When O
our O
friends O
arrived, O
the B-TARGET
owner I-TARGET
expressed O
a O
surprise. O

The O
cafe O
was O
not O
closed O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
preparations, O
the O
last O
visitor O
left O
5 O
minutes O
before O
our O
arrival. O

Staff, B-TARGET
gently O
speaking, O
was O
lacking O
and O
the O
owner O
offered O
our O
friends O
to O
wash O
the O
fruits O
themselves, O
cover O
the O
tables, O
etc. O

Approximately O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
banquet, O
the O
host O
that O
he O
is O
feeling O
bad O
and O
will O
go O
home O
(he O
is O
actively O
involved O
in O
the O
service). O

With O
us O
there O
was O
1 O
(!) O
waitress, B-TARGET
who, O
despite O
a O
small O
number O
of O
guests, O
did O
not O
manage O
at O
all. O

We B-TARGET
literally I-TARGET
cleaned I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
ourselves. O

The O
cake O
has O
been O
waiting O
for O
about O
half O
an O
hour. O

several O
times O
asked O
to O
take O
it O
out, O
then O
very O
long O
waiting O
for O
cups, O
tea, O
etc. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
looked O
like O
just O
a O
street O
boy O
who O
doesn’t O
understand O
what O
we O
want O
from O
him. O

In O
general, O
prepared O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
served O
also O
well, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
attitude O
shocked O
and O
somewhat O
ruined O
the O
overall O
impression O
of O
the O
holiday. O

We O
visited O
the O
building O
during O
the O
daytime. O

It O
was O
neither O
lunch O
nor O
dinner, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
we O
can O
say O
directly O
no, O
but O
the O
view B-TARGET
forgives O
everything, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
the O
Vyborg O
side O
of O
the O
hometown. O

Service B-TARGET
at O
a O
good O
level. O

Fast, O
high O
quality O
service, B-TARGET
although O
one O
dish O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
forgot O
to O
bring. O

Travellers O
liked O
everything O
they O
ordered O
and O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crabs I-TARGET
and O
pasta B-TARGET
(fetucini) I-TARGET
and O
risotto, B-TARGET
fish B-TARGET
sibas. I-TARGET

All O
desserts O
were O
selected O
from O
the O
menu, O
except O
for O
the O
day O
cake. O

We O
tried O
each O
other. O

Liked O
very O
much. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
"Coffee" I-TARGET
slowly O
but O
surely O
begins O
to O
transform O
from O
a O
decent O
place O
into O
a O
regular O
runner-up. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
came O
to O
cook O
a O
few O
times O
a O
week O
for O
lunch O
and O
were O
their O
regular O
clients. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
last O
1.5 O
- O
2 O
months O
after O
visiting O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
remain O
only O
unpleasant O
impressions: O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
- O
quite O
"not O
at O
the O
level", O
the O
administrators B-TARGET
- O
they O
can O
become O
an O
unpleasant O
person. O

Today, O
after O
a O
few O
"cossacks", O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
polently O
asked O
to O
invite O
the O
administrator. O

After O
20 O
minutes, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
came O
and O
said, O
"Sorry, O
but O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
is O
so O
busy O
now O
that O
he O
can't O
get O
to O
you. O

You O
can O
come O
after O
16-00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" O
How O
do O
you O
think O
it???????? O

Just O
no O
words! O

In O
general, O
to O
anyone O
who O
knows O
a O
lot O
in O
decent O
restaurants, O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
going O
to O
"POVARI"! B-TARGET

It O
was O
a O
few O
days O
ago. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
fine, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
liked O
it. O

The O
menu O
is O
Italian, O
the O
music O
is O
French, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
nothing. O

True O
fish, B-TARGET
apparently, O
is O
not O
the O
first O
freshness, O
because O
of O
which O
they O
roast O
it O
to O
rubber. O

Some O
types B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
from O
the O
menu O
are O
not, O
explained O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
a O
Friday, O
all O
eaten. O

We O
were O
there O
on O
Saturday O
night O
and O
were O
the O
only O
guests. O

The O
rest, O
of O
the O
chosen, B-TARGET
was I-TARGET
normal. I-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
dessert. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
nice. O

I O
would O
go O
again... O

Only O
more O
people O
would... O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places!! B-TARGET

We O
spent O
almost O
the O
whole O
summer O
there!! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
talk O
and O
drink O
a O
delicious O
beer B-TARGET
with O
rings O
or O
rings O
of O
calmar, O
you O
are O
here! O

The O
interior O
is O
very O
cozy, O
we O
sit O
wherever O
possible, O
in O
the O
summer O
on O
the O
street O
there O
is O
one O
minus, O
that O
they O
sometimes O
sew O
and O
forget O
about O
the O
people O
"on O
top". O

And O
inside O
I O
like O
to O
sit O
both O
at O
the O
table O
and O
at O
the O
stand. O

Barmen O
and O
waiters B-TARGET
work O
instantly, O
after O
ordering O
a O
maximum O
of O
a O
minute O
and O
beer O
before O
you O
with O
snacks O
in O
different O
ways, O
well, O
this O
is O
what O
I O
can O
note O
that O
it O
has O
always O
been O
delicious. O

I O
advise O
you O
to O
take O
a O
variety O
of B-TARGET
snacks I-TARGET
(there O
are O
cheese O
sticks O
and O
calmar O
rings, O
potatoes O
and O
sausages) O
for O
beer O
in O
sufficient O
quantities. O

From O
beer O
I O
personally O
like O
there O
cherry B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
almonds, I-TARGET
well, O
in O
principle O
I O
tried O
all O
kinds O
of O
sweet B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
there, O
because O
I O
love O
it, O
in O
the O
summer O
there O
were O
about O
5-6 O
varieties. O

This O
weekend, O
they O
said O
there O
was O
only O
cherry. O

The O
guys O
there O
also O
break O
away, O
saying O
that O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
super O
especially O
Guinness. B-TARGET

We O
like O
it O
and O
bring O
friends O
there. O

Sometimes O
you O
can O
ask O
and O
make O
the O
music O
louder O
if O
it O
plays O
a O
famous O
hit. O
:) O

We O
feel O
like O
at O
home O
there! O

I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
we O
celebrated O
my O
husband’s O
birthday O
on O
September O
9, O
2010. O

Until O
this O
day, O
the O
pizza O
hut O
at O
Moscow O
Pr. O
224 O
visited O
the O
last O
time O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
was O
pleased, O
so O
in O
the O
old O
memory O
and O
came O
again, O
but..... O
waited O
15 O
minutes O
until O
the O
waitress O
went, O
hurra, O
the O
waitress O
came, O
we O
ordered O
grins, O
beer, O
caesar O
salad O
and O
pizza. O

The O
grains O
carried O
about O
20 O
minutes, O
not O
getting O
a O
little O
to O
our O
table, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
dropped O
them O
on O
the O
floor... O
then O
the O
grains O
were O
waiting O
again O
and O
here O
they O
were O
brought O
with O
a O
warm O
beer, B-TARGET
then O
they O
brought O
Caesar’s O
salad, O
I O
think O
we O
all O
know O
how O
it O
looks, O
it O
turns O
out O
not. O

Caesar O
salad O
consisted O
of O
the O
following O
components: O
at O
the O
bottom O
were O
large O
4 O
pieces O
(namely O
a O
piece) O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
baget, O
on O
top O
salad O
leaves, O
then O
a O
little O
tomato O
and O
exactly O
4 O
large O
stripes O
of O
chicken, O
there O
was O
no O
parmesan B-TARGET
at O
all, O
cool? O

Then O
they O
brought O
a O
pizza B-TARGET
– O
it O
was O
probably O
made O
of O
rubber. O

It O
is O
worth O
all O
this O
"pleasure" O
is O
not O
cheap, O
service... O
yes, O
I O
forgot O
to O
drink O
that O
there O
was O
still O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
though O
the O
musician B-TARGET
frankly O
falsified. O

It O
becomes O
scary O
that O
there O
are O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
decent O
restaurants O
in O
Peter. O

We O
will O
never O
come O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
again. O

In O
this O
cafe O
entered O
completely O
accidentally, O
bypassing O
the O
nearest O
establishment O
without O
finding O
a O
suitable O
one! O

The O
cafe O
interior B-TARGET
was O
very O
liked O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
stay O
so O
to O
say O
"not O
looking O
at O
the O
menu." O

The O
next O
day O
we O
came O
with O
friends, O
they O
were O
also O
delighted! O

The O
advantages O
of O
the O
cafe O
would O
like O
to O
include O
the O
following: O
1) O
delicious O
cuisine B-TARGET
2) O
affordable O
prices O
3) O
cozy O
environment B-TARGET

To O
the O
disadvantages: O
location B-TARGET
(located O
in O
the O
yard), O
but O
personally O
it O
does O
not O
stress O
me O
much! O

I O
met O
in O
this O
pub O
with O
a O
friend. O

It O
was O
Thursday O
afternoon. O

Visitors O
were O
few O
at O
first, O
but O
the O
closer O
the O
time O
to O
the O
evening, O
the O
more O
the O
bar O
was O
filled. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
there O
was O
no O
smoke O
in O
the O
hall, O
see O
a O
good O
and O
thoughtful O
ventilation B-TARGET
system. O

A O
pleasant, O
quite O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
style O
of O
the O
pub. O

Very O
good O
menu, B-TARGET
but O
everything O
is O
very O
tasty, O
delicious. O

And O
large O
portions B-TARGET
that O
can O
not O
dislike O
men. O

My O
friend O
has O
been O
here O
much O
more O
often O
than O
me, O
says O
she O
has O
tried O
almost O
everything, O
and O
she O
likes O
it. O

The O
girl-ofoiciant B-TARGET
rushed O
to O
serve O
us, O
to O
my O
joke O
comment O
about O
something O
easy O
and O
low-calorie O
responded O
very O
quickly O
and O
offered O
several O
options O
of O
dishes, O
although O
I O
was O
not O
going O
to O
follow O
a O
strict O
diet O
or O
any O
restrictions O
in O
food. O

I O
answered O
all O
the O
questions O
immediately O
and O
thoroughly, O
which O
is O
very O
pleasant. O

She O
may O
not O
always O
responded O
immediately O
to O
our O
requests, O
but O
she O
did O
the O
job O
well. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
that O
day. O

But O
since O
I O
was O
driving, O
I O
didn’t O
care, O
and O
my O
friend O
helped O
make O
the O
right O
choice O
and O
she O
was O
happy. O

I O
liked O
the O
pub. B-TARGET

If O
there O
are O
any O
meetings O
in O
this O
area O
or O
just O
want O
to O
eat, O
I O
will O
definitely O
go O
there O
again. O

I O
am O
delighted O
to O
leave O
a O
new O
comment O
about O
Cigar! B-TARGET

Since O
the O
first O
visit O
it O
has O
been O
quite O
a O
long O
time, O
during O
which O
repeatedly O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
- O
at O
first O
it O
was O
caused O
by O
purely O
objective O
circumstances O
- O
convenient O
location O
to O
the O
house, O
but O
each O
time O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
left O
the O
best O
and O
the O
best O
impression. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive, O
even O
with O
the O
absolute O
load O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
is O
always O
in O
the O
zone O
of O
visibility; O
can O
always O
tell O
you O
what O
a O
certain O
dish O
is; O
everything O
is O
taken O
/ O
cleaned O
in O
time. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
the O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
- O
my O
name O
is O
Ilya O
- O
very O
good! O

The O
food B-TARGET
remained O
satisfied O
every O
time O
- O
salads B-TARGET
always O
from O
fresh O
vegetables, O
crazyly O
delicious O
hatchapuri, B-TARGET
a O
very O
decent O
lagman. B-TARGET

A O
worthy O
wine B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
- O
there O
is O
no O
"so-your O
wine". B-TARGET

For O
a O
long O
time O
bring O
compliment B-TARGET
in O
the O
form O
of O
Irana O
- O
who O
loves O
this O
drink, O
will O
appreciate. O

In O
general, O
the O
good O
guys O
- O
long O
and O
5+ O
corrected O
the O
shortcomings O
of O
the O
opening O
period. O

And O
right O
now O
I O
can O
say O
that O
this O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
southern O
outskirts O
of O
our O
city. O

I O
will O
continue O
to O
come O
to O
you O
for O
lunch O
and O
dinner. O

Parking B-TARGET
was O
even O
better. O

I O
was O
recently O
with O
my O
wife O
at O
this O
restaurant, O
the O
service B-TARGET
liked, O
but O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
could O
have O
been O
faster. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
liked O
without O
excess O
everything O
in O
a O
strict O
style. O

I O
ordered O
a O
caesar O
salad O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

I O
will O
say O
that O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
just O
amazing O
everything O
brought O
quickly, O
and O
most O
importantly O
delicious. O

I O
just O
often O
go O
to O
restaurants O
and O
order O
mostly O
shishes O
(if O
any) O
and O
caesarean O
salad, O
and O
I O
have O
something O
to O
compare, O
I O
will O
say O
that O
the O
salad B-TARGET
is O
worth O
its O
money, O
and O
shishes O
too, O
but O
the O
bar B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
expensive. O

The O
truth O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
probably O
thought O
we O
would O
sit O
down O
and O
order O
something O
else, O
but O
it O
didn’t O
stress O
us O
very O
much, O
as O
we O
wanted O
romance O
near O
the O
Gulf O
of O
Finland. O

To O
be O
honest, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
romantically O
and O
most O
importantly O
deliciously, O
this O
is O
the O
place. B-TARGET

Truth O
now O
is O
not O
the O
season O
and O
we O
were O
not O
sitting O
on O
the O
street O
(cold) O
but O
it O
is O
a O
pity. O

Hopefully O
next O
summer O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
there O
and O
sit O
together O
with O
my O
wife O
in O
a O
romantic O
setting. B-TARGET

I O
wish O
success O
and O
prosperity O
to O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Previously, O
they O
frequently O
went O
to O
EURASIA O
GOLD O
on O
the O
Small O
Posadskaya. O

Certainly O
not O
the O
doctor O
:) O

But O
once O
I O
was O
in O
guests O
at O
the O
wedding O
(there O
I O
almost O
didn’t O
eat, O
so O
I’m O
going O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
my O
visits O
just O
“to O
eat”). O

What O
attracts O
hunger? O

So O
it O
happened O
that O
during O
frequent O
visits, O
good O
relationships O
developed O
with O
the O
waiters O
and O
therefore O
there O
were O
no O
problems O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

From O
the O
food O
I O
almost O
always O
eat O
and O
drink O
the O
same O
thing: O
miso O
soup O
(well O
it’s O
hard O
to O
spoil, O
it’s O
almost O
the O
same O
thing), O
Philadelphia O
– O
unlike O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
restaurants O
of O
the O
network, O
the O
roll O
is O
big O
and O
very O
tasty, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
judge, O
all O
the O
foods O
are O
fresh O
(which-where O
in O
the O
dryers O
gets O
dried O
rice, O
but O
here O
with O
this O
ok:)))) O
2 O
of O
my O
favorite O
dishes O
– O
baked O
midias O
(not O
so O
often O
I O
order O
them O
elsewhere, O
but O
such O
huge O
and O
tasty O
as O
in O
Golda, O
I O
haven’t O
seen O
anywhere) O
and O
Minari O
(sweet O
roll O
with O
banana O
and O
chocolate, O
also O
very O
tasty). O

I O
always O
advise O
everyone. O

I O
don't O
know O
how O
now, O
but O
2 O
months O
ago O
when O
ordering O
MOHITO O
asked O
- O
big O
or O
small. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
Big O
is O
virtually O
cool O
:) O

Very O
delicious O
mochito. B-TARGET

I O
can’t O
talk O
about O
the O
whole O
kitchen. O

But O
in O
my O
subjective O
impressions, O
my O
4 O
favorite O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
the O
Mohito B-TARGET
in O
Golda O
are O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city! O

We O
were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
the O
weekend. O

We O
liked O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
overall O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Behind O
such O
a O
stylish, O
interesting O
interior B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
diverse O
menu B-TARGET
hides O
hospitality B-TARGET
and O
respect, O
there O
is O
no O
drop O
of O
pathos O
and O
unreasonable O
prices, O
and O
the O
quality O
corresponds O
to O
the O
supply. B-TARGET

In O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
weekend O
we O
freely O
chose O
from O
several O
tables, O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
was O
just O
wonderful, O
non-obsessive O
and O
extremely O
harmoniously O
selected O
repertoire. B-TARGET

The O
menu O
really O
made O
a O
long O
time O
to O
choose, O
and O
not O
because O
there O
is O
nothing O
to O
choose O
from, O
but O
rather O
a O
lot O
I O
wanted O
to O
try. O

The O
ordered O
dishes B-TARGET
delighted O
and O
serving B-TARGET
and O
taste, O
it O
was O
a O
rabbit B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
nuts I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
ravioli B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
strawberries B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomatoes I-TARGET
- O
all O
very O
delicious. O

Unfortunately O
I O
didn’t O
get O
to O
the O
dessert O
:) O

It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
visit O
here O
and O
we O
hope O
to O
spend O
time O
here O
again O
:) O

P.s. O
strawberries B-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomatoes I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
- O
just O
magical! O
:) O

Thanks O
to O
you! O

We O
wish O
you O
to O
remain O
as O
unique O
and O
original! O
:) O

Hello O
to O
all! O

This O
week O
visited O
with O
a O
friend O
Coffee O
and O
seductive O
name O
appetite) O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
immediately O
met O
a O
smiling O
girl, B-TARGET
asked O
where O
we O
would O
like O
to O
sit O
and O
gave O
the O
menu. O

Interiors B-TARGET
very O
located, O
comfortable O
sofas, B-TARGET
quiet O
music B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
approached O
almost O
immediately, O
advised O
to O
try O
from O
desserts O
Sakura O
and O
strawberry O
tea!) O

I O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long, O
brought O
everything O
quickly, O
which O
is O
very O
pleasant O
when O
ordering O
the O
sturdel) O

One O
of O
the O
best O
places B-TARGET
for O
the O
ratio O
of O
price O
and O
quality, O
we O
are O
sure O
to O
go O
further O
to O
try O
dishes O
with O
original O
names) O

We O
went O
to O
this O
institution B-TARGET
for O
dinner O
based O
on O
good O
reviews O
on O
various O
websites. O

Dinner O
with O
my O
husband. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
well O
equipped O
for O
food. O

I O
feel O
more O
positive O
than O
negative O
about O
Ikea’s B-TARGET
furniture))) I-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
quite O
hasty O
and O
attentive. O

True, O
as O
someone O
has O
already O
written O
here, O
for O
some O
reason O
different O
approaches O
were O
all O
the O
time...Strange O
approach. O

Now, O
as O
for O
the O
kitchen: O
first O
I O
wanted O
to O
order O
a O
paste, O
but O
as O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
half B-TARGET
of O
the O
portion O
can O
not O
be O
taken, O
and O
the O
whole O
portion B-TARGET
is O
up O
to O
500 O
grams, O
which O
is O
just O
unrealistic O
for O
me O
to O
eat))) O

Not O
yet O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
can O
calmly O
pack O
a O
pack B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
pasta, I-TARGET
it O
is O
worth O
thinking O
about O
fragile O
girls O
customers! O

I O
had O
to O
take O
soup. O

I O
chose O
a O
cream O
broccoli O
soup, O
which O
I O
really O
love. O

A O
soup B-TARGET
I’ve O
never O
eaten O
before. O

I O
didn't O
think O
that O
it O
(soup) B-TARGET
can O
be O
ruined: O
it O
smelled O
like O
burning O
squashes B-TARGET
(I O
principally O
love O
fat, O
but O
in O
my O
understanding O
the O
salad O
is O
not O
a O
place O
in O
the O
broccoli O
cream O
soup) O
and O
not O
just O
smelled O
( O

He O
had O
to O
eat O
bread O
with O
oil O
and O
steal O
from O
his O
husband, O
ordered O
by O
him O
a O
lasagna, B-TARGET
which, O
by O
the O
way, O
was O
quite O
decent. O

My O
husband O
stayed O
quite O
satisfied, O
I O
didn’t O
go O
hungry O
either O
(the O
bread B-TARGET
was O
very O
delicious))))) O

Maybe O
I O
was O
just O
not O
lucky, O
but O
I O
concluded O
for O
myself O
that O
I O
would O
not O
go O
there O
again. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
establishment O
since O
it O
was O
called O
the O
“Sushi O
House”. O

With O
the O
change O
of O
the O
name O
a O
little O
changed O
the O
menu, O
no O
more O
changes O
noticed. O

Very O
pleasant O
place, B-TARGET
very O
quiet O
(provided O
that O
only O
one O
hall), O
tables O
at O
a O
distance O
from O
each O
other, O
so O
that O
if O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
you O
people O
are O
sitting O
still O
you O
can O
talk O
and O
eat O
quietly O
without O
listening O
to O
other O
people's O
conversations. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
nothing O
impressive O
except O
(again!) O
the O
toilet. O
=) O

The O
food O
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
brought O
quickly O
as O
well. O

No O
one O
has O
been O
waiting O
for O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour. O

The O
girls B-TARGET
are O
very O
cute, O
friendly, O
will O
always O
help. O

From O
specific O
dishes O
I O
can O
note O
cream B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood. I-TARGET

Very O
delicious! O

He O
celebrated O
his O
birthday O
several O
times O
in O
a O
narrow O
family O
circle. O

A O
vase O
for O
flowers O
is O
always O
brought O
by O
themselves O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
see O
that O
a O
visitor O
comes O
with O
flowers. O

is O
pleasant. O

Every O
time O
they O
came O
out, O
they O
were O
excited O
and O
very O
pleased. O

My O
favorite O
sushi B-TARGET
in O
the O
city. O

We O
were O
there O
and O
will O
not O
go O
again! O

A O
terrible O
service! B-TARGET

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
not O
worth O
as O
much O
as O
it O
is O
written O
in O
the O
menu. O

As O
for O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
this O
is O
completely O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
name. O

We O
came O
there O
to O
celebrate O
a O
friend’s O
birthday. O

It O
started O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
a O
hammered O
waitress B-TARGET
approached O
us O
- O
a O
trainee O
who O
doesn't O
know O
the O
elementary O
things, O
what O
the O
dish O
is O
made O
of. O

Then O
in O
the O
half-empty O
restaurant O
we O
waited O
for O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
for O
our O
order. O

The O
fact O
that O
we O
ate O
no O
pleasure O
caused, O
drinks B-TARGET
only O
more O
than O
less, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
prompt O
to O
leave O
even O
10 O
p. O
on O
tea... O

We O
remained O
very O
dissatisfied! O

We O
will O
not O
go O
there O
anymore O
and O
will O
not O
recommend O
it O
to O
friends. O

This O
place B-TARGET
left O
a O
double O
opinion. O

On O
the O
one O
hand, O
interesting O
interior, B-TARGET
decent O
kitchen B-TARGET
(ordered O
pasta B-TARGET
and O
wine), B-TARGET
but O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
(unfortunately, O
did O
not O
remember O
the O
name) O
we O
ordered O
tired. O

The O
case O
was O
so. O

We O
arrived O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
after O
lunch, O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
people O
in O
the O
room, O
so O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
immediately O
approached O
us. O

Accepted O
the O
order O
and O
disappeared. O

Waited O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine O
for O
20 O
minutes, O
then O
another O
paste O
for O
25 O
minutes. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
the O
bartender B-TARGET
looked O
at O
us O
very O
strangely O
when O
we O
approached O
to O
find O
out O
about O
the O
hot. O

But O
with O
whom O
it O
does O
not O
happen, O
we O
thought O
and O
did O
not O
mistake, O
because O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
appeared O
and O
apologized. O

Then O
there O
was O
the O
show! O

He O
suddenly O
came O
up O
every O
5 O
minutes O
(while O
we O
were O
eating) O
and O
talked O
about O
the O
show O
that O
would O
take O
place O
in O
the O
evening. O

After O
the O
words O
"We O
will O
definitely O
come" O
he O
left O
and O
appeared O
again O
with O
a O
new O
portion O
of O
information. O

After O
the O
third O
approach, O
I O
couldn’t O
stand O
and O
asked, O
“You O
don’t O
have O
anyone O
to O
talk O
to? O
but O
what O
about O
the O
bartender?” O
we O
got O
absolutely O
sincere, O
“she O
has O
PMS O
today!” O

It O
is O
good O
that O
we O
have O
already O
eaten O
at O
the O
time O
of O
this O
masterpiece O
response. O

Asked O
for O
an O
account. O

I O
cried O
out O
and O
decided O
not O
to O
change O
this O
gentleman O
anymore O
:) O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
are O
there O
regularly. O

Very!!! O
like O
hot, O
with O
a O
crunchy O
shell O
of O
pancakes. B-TARGET

In O
the O
portion O
of O
them O
3 O
pieces: O
rugged, O
wheat O
and O
mixed. O

They O
sometimes O
bring O
butter O
to O
them.) O

By O
the O
time O
they O
bring O
snacks, O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
from O
the O
table O
are O
already O
gone: O
we O
can’t O
just O
look O
at O
them, O
they’re O
really O
delicious. O

I O
read O
a O
review O
about O
hatchapuri B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese, I-TARGET
and O
I O
already O
want O
to O
try O
it, O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
it O
will O
be O
uncomfortable! O

I O
can O
never O
refrain O
from O
ordering O
baked B-TARGET
midias I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
butter I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
which O
are O
served O
on O
a O
large O
plate O
of O
bitter O
sea O
salt. O

And O
I’ll O
never O
give O
up O
a O
shale B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
lamb I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
a O
bone!!! O

The B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
unusual, O
as O
is O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
to O
it. O

And O
what O
is O
very O
pleasant O
- O
a O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
water I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
lemon I-TARGET
for O
washing O
hands O
is O
brought O
to O
the O
shale: O
I O
love O
to O
eat O
shale O
with O
my O
hands. O

My O
husband O
usually O
orders O
fish, B-TARGET
which O
is O
always O
delighted!!! O

It O
is O
delicious O
here! O

We O
recommend. O

The O
interior O
will O
not O
be O
pleasant: O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
90s O
of O
the O
last O
century... O
but O
this O
does O
not O
prevent O
a O
good O
time O
in O
this O
institution. O

The O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
windows O
will O
add O
positive O
emotions. O

The O
service O
staff B-TARGET
does O
not O
cause O
complaints, O
but O
they O
do O
not O
always O
want O
to O
deliver.))) O

I O
love O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
food! B-TARGET

But O
there O
is O
one O
YEAR O
ago O
in O
this O
restaurant O
worked O
a O
completely O
different O
staff B-TARGET
(other O
waiters, O
administrator). O

The O
group O
that O
was O
before, O
I O
liked O
much O
more! O

The O
waiters O
knew O
the O
menu O
from O
and O
before, O
could O
advise O
and O
tell O
about O
each O
dish O
detailed O
information, O
accepted O
the O
order, O
did O
not O
record O
it, O
forgot O
absolutely O
everything! O

They O
were O
crazy O
attentive, O
kind O
and O
welcoming! O

After O
the O
staff B-TARGET
changed, O
I O
was O
often O
confused O
with O
the O
dishes O
that O
I O
ordered O
and O
brought O
something O
completely O
different, O
something O
I O
completely O
forgot. O

The O
child O
once O
poured O
out O
a O
cocktail, O
so O
we O
could O
not O
call O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
for O
5 O
minutes O
and O
wiped O
out O
as O
much O
as O
we O
could! O

And O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
know O
little O
about O
their O
dishes, O
I’m O
not O
even O
talking O
about! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
just O
as O
delicious... O

I O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
before, O
and O
I O
visited O
it O
once O
a O
week O
exactly! O

There O
is O
no O
such O
great O
desire O
now. O

If O
I O
knew O
the O
place O
where O
the O
former O
group O
was O
transferred, O
I O
would O
most O
likely O
visit O
it. O

A O
great O
establishment. B-TARGET

Walked O
with O
his O
girlfriend O
on O
Krestovsky, O
decided O
to O
sit O
in O
for O
a O
coffee O
drink. O

The O
girl O
really O
liked O
tiramisu B-TARGET
(this O
is O
her O
favorite O
dessert, B-TARGET
she O
said O
it O
was O
cooked O
great). O

I O
ordered O
myself O
a O
fruit B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
pretty O
delicious, O
although O
I O
prefer O
high-calorie O
food O
:). O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
the B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
know O
their O
job. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
because O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
this, O
but O
it O
seems O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
in O
the O
French O
style. O

A O
very O
good O
restaurant! B-TARGET

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
non-expensive O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
found O
it. O

The O
wedding O
was O
celebrated O
on O
May O
21st, O
and O
there O
was O
not O
much O
people. O

Lovely O
administrator B-TARGET
Olga, O
immediately O
offered O
the O
VIP B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
which O
is O
the O
most O
pleasant, O
for O
him O
there O
is O
no O
separate O
fee. O

We O
came O
and O
pleasantly O
surprised, O
the O
tables O
were O
not O
empty, O
the O
salads B-TARGET
were O
all O
delicious, O
I O
want O
to O
pay O
special O
attention O
to O
the O
steak, B-TARGET
about O
it O
something! O

All O
my O
guests O
were O
very O
happy, O
by O
the O
way, O
everyone O
remembers O
the O
steak B-TARGET
who O
ate O
it O
:) O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
bring O
alcohol O
with O
us, O
but O
we O
also O
bought O
a O
little O
there. O

Everything O
very O
much O
liked! O

Toilets B-TARGET
are O
fun, O
in O
mirrors, O
and O
in O
a O
man's O
wall O
water O
runs O
(husband O
said) O

Kalyan B-TARGET
is O
really O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city! O

Everyone O
here!! O

And O
this O
is O
not O
advertising, O
really O
here O
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
delicious O
and O
just O
nice O
to O
be, O
new O
interior B-TARGET
solutions. O

I O
recently O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
"MASSMEDIA" O
with O
my O
husband, O
and O
not O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

Honestly, O
after O
visiting, O
I O
was O
in O
shock O
for O
a O
while. O

and O
horror. O

Masami, B-TARGET
what O
happened O
to O
you? O

Where O
did O
that O
friendly O
staff O
go, O
and O
that O
almost O
perfect O
service??? O

At O
first, O
it O
seemed O
like O
nothing, O
met O
and O
planted, O
and O
then O
it O
all O
began, O
my O
husband O
brought O
a O
dish O
first O
of O
me, O
everything O
can O
be O
and O
nothing, O
if O
it O
wasn't O
the O
waiter's B-TARGET
answer: O
"Well, O
sorry, O
how O
they O
prepared."... O
(in O
general, O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
to O
be O
desired). O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dinner, O
we O
were O
completely O
forgotten. O

It O
seems O
that O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
more O
interested O
in O
communicating O
with O
the O
bartender O
and O
the O
manager O
than O
with O
the O
guests O
of O
their O
restaurant. O

Masmidia O
teach O
your O
staff, B-TARGET
because O
this O
is O
the O
key O
to O
success. O

As O
a O
result, O
the O
evening O
was O
ruined. O

If O
it O
is O
worth O
to O
go O
there, O
then O
exclusively O
on O
your O
favorite O
middies, B-TARGET
and O
then O
quickly O
run O
away O
from O
there O
until O
the O
naughty O
staff B-TARGET
did O
not O
repel O
the O
desire O
at O
least O
to O
run O
on O
them!!!! O

Honestly, O
we O
will O
not O
come O
again, O
and O
we O
do O
not O
advise O
others. O

What O
was O
the O
beginning? O

Those O
who O
love O
delicious O
cooked O
food, B-TARGET
come O
to O
Diana, B-TARGET
you O
will O
not O
regret. O

The O
next O
day, O
my O
colleagues O
and O
I O
celebrated O
our O
birthday O
and O
we O
all O
liked O
this O
place. B-TARGET

Since O
there O
are O
many O
birthdays O
in O
the O
year, O
we O
have O
visited O
almost O
all O
such O
establishments O
near O
Senna O
and O
can O
quite O
compare O
them. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
in O
Diana O
is O
not O
inferior O
to O
the O
first O
drink, O
while O
the O
prices O
are O
significantly O
lower. O

On O
our O
request, O
we O
made O
cocktails, O
although O
they O
are O
not O
in O
the O
menu. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
also O
at O
a O
high O
level. O

Of O
the O
small O
disadvantages O
- O
long O
cooked O
hot O
(this O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
and O
ordered O
immediately) O
and O
Mohito B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
unusual O
- O
with O
a O
caramel O
and O
too O
sweet O
taste O

We O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
and O
celebrated O
our O
birthday. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
poor, O
very O
long O
carried O
drinks, O
had O
to O
repeat O
several O
times O
to O
the O
waitress. B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
salads O
and O
second O
meals O
in O
advance, O
made O
a O
prepayment O
and O
the O
manager O
promised O
that O
by O
our O
arrival O
everything O
would O
be O
ready. O

They O
came, O
as O
if O
they O
were O
not O
waiting O
for O
us. O

The O
heat O
truck O
departed O
from O
the O
shore, O
and O
the O
table O
was O
not O
covered. O

The O
second O
was O
given O
when O
the O
heater O
was O
returning. O

I O
barely O
had O
time O
to O
eat O
the O
ordered O
meals. O

Now O
about O
the O
kitchen O
– O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small, O
meat B-TARGET
hard, O
and O
prices O
are O
high O
for O
such O
food. B-TARGET

I O
was O
uncomfortable O
before O
the O
guests, O
poor O
service B-TARGET
smoothed O
a O
wonderful O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window O
and O
a O
pleasant O
interior. B-TARGET

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
several O
times. O

I O
can’t O
say O
I’m O
a O
gourmet, O
but O
I O
liked O
the O
cuisine. B-TARGET

The O
fact O
is O
that O
I O
don’t O
eat O
sushi O
and O
rolls, O
but O
I O
eat O
meat, O
and O
I’d O
start O
taking O
soup O
except O
for O
a O
business O
lunch. O

In O
short, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
go O
here O
for O
those O
who O
prefer O
the O
second B-TARGET
and O
salads, B-TARGET
for O
them O
things O
are O
fine. O

Dried B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
is O
a O
huge O
choice, O
and O
salads O
with O
vegetables, O
chicken, O
meat, O
etc. O

All O
as O
I O
love. O

Regarding O
the O
situation B-TARGET
- O
yes, O
it O
is O
standard, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
the O
Theme O
of O
Lebedev, O
and O
therefore O
the O
mega-design O
finds O
do O
not O
interest O
me, O
I O
came O
here O
to O
eat, O
not O
to O
look O
at O
the O
design. O

The O
same O
applies O
to O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
waitress. O

People O
are O
few O
and O
that’s O
great. O

The O
room B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
smokers I-TARGET
separately, O
so O
it O
was O
not O
stressful. O

In O
terms O
of O
service B-TARGET
- O
I O
agree O
100% O
with O
the O
opinion O
that O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
change. O

There O
were O
those O
who O
served O
on O
9 O
and O
there O
were O
also O
on O
1 O
(with O
these O
immediately O
settled). O

On O
desserts O
- O
usually O
taken O
ice B-TARGET
cream, I-TARGET
it O
is O
of O
course O
delicious, O
but O
we O
next O
to O
the O
house O
exactly O
the O
same O
weight O
is O
sold, O
i.e. O
nothing O
special. O

The O
energy O
restaurant. O

We O
went O
in O
with O
a O
young O
man, O
no O
waitress B-TARGET
looked O
at O
us! O

Sitting O
at O
a O
selected O
table. O

10 O
minutes O
to O
wait O
for O
the B-TARGET
waiter. I-TARGET

Did O
not O
wait... O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
menu. O

15 O
minutes O
later, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
arrived. O

Further O
is O
worse. O

During O
the O
time O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
the O
order, O
we O
managed O
to O
serve O
two O
pairs. O

If O
I O
honestly O
wanted O
to O
leave, O
but O
apparently O
wanted O
more, O
stayed. O

No O
pleasure O
in O
visiting. O

I O
quickly O
received O
the O
account. O

There O
if O
you O
only O
go O
for O
cheap O
shares, O
but O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
card, O
you O
still O
expect O
positive O
emotions O
from O
visiting O
such O
institutions B-TARGET
for O
any O
money. O

It’s O
great O
to O
watch O
football O
at O
this O
club! O

Many O
screens B-TARGET
are O
conveniently O
located. O

Lovely O
musical B-TARGET
accompaniment. I-TARGET

This O
place O
caused O
my O
association O
with O
the O
restaurant O
:) O

Great O
choice O
of O
delicious O
beer. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
deserves O
attention. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
high O
quality, O
delicious. O

Interiors B-TARGET
cute, O
especially, O
sorry, O
in O
the O
women's B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
very O
liked O
(excellent O
hearing O
of O
sports. O
broadcasts, O
not O
only O
noted O
by O
me O
:D) O

It O
is O
worth O
working O
on O
the O
professionalism O
of O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
case, O
they O
ordered O
salads, O
waited O
a O
long O
time, O
in O
general, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
forgot O
about O
them, O
had O
to O
disturb O
the O
young O
man O
serving O
the O
neighboring O
table, O
the O
situation O
was O
corrected, O
another O
waiter B-TARGET
came, O
already O
without O
complaints O
fulfilled O
his O
duties. O

There O
was O
a O
feeling O
that O
there O
were O
few O
waiters B-TARGET
in O
the O
whole O
room. O

I O
wish O
Finnegans O
prosperity, O
a O
good O
place. B-TARGET

I O
will O
tell O
a O
wonderful O
story O
about O
how O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Troika" I-TARGET
valued O
customers. O

My O
friend O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
her O
birthday O
in O
this O
place. O
so O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
day O
of O
celebration O
coincided O
with O
the O
eve O
of O
Easter. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
empty! O
(the O
table O
was O
ordered O
at O
7 O
pm) O

Open O
on O
my O
birthday O
:) O

I O
have O
no O
complaints O
about O
the O
service, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
perfect! O

For O
me, O
as O
a O
person O
who O
does O
not O
eat O
meat O
and O
poultry, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
order. O

The O
hot O
meals O
of O
fish O
did O
not O
attract O
my O
attention O
that O
day. O

I O
ordered O
a O
hot O
vegetable O
snack. O

To O
be O
honest, O
the O
appearance O
I O
did O
not O
like O
too O
much O
(it O
is O
only O
because O
of O
the O
method O
of O
cooking, O
vegetables O
after O
heat O
treatment O
lose O
their O
brightness), O
the O
main O
thing, O
it O
was O
amazingly O
delicious, O
considering O
that O
at O
the O
time O
of O
serving O
the O
dish B-TARGET
I O
was O
no O
longer O
hungry. O

This O
was O
the O
second O
time O
in O
my O
life O
that O
I O
ate O
with O
such O
an O
appetite. O

The O
culprit O
of O
the O
celebration O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
dessert O
from O
the O
institution. O

I O
can’t O
ignore O
the O
artists. B-TARGET

Beautiful, O
professional O
(unfortunately O
not O
in O
my O
taste O
such O
shows, O
mostly O
with O
great O
interest O
looked O
at O
decorations O
and O
costumes). O

I O
have O
decided O
to O
visit O
this O
place B-TARGET
regularly. O

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Troika" I-TARGET
for O
the O
great O
impressions! O

I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
the O
whole O
family O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
team I-TARGET
for O
organizing O
the O
work O
on O
my O
mother’s O
anniversary! O

From O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
our O
communication O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
we O
can O
entrust O
the O
employees B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
conduct O
such O
an O
important O
event O
for O
us. O

We O
offered O
various O
options B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
menus, I-TARGET
options O
for O
landing O
guests. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
event O
friendly O
welcomed O
guests O
and O
the O
name, O
it O
was O
visible O
that O
we O
are O
very O
much O
awaited O
here. O

According O
to O
the O
reviews O
of O
the O
guests, O
and O
in O
our O
opinion O
- O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
delicious O
(for O
which O
thank O
you O
to O
the B-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
)! O

Beautiful O
dishes, B-TARGET
decoration, B-TARGET
serving, B-TARGET
and O
of O
course, O
taste B-TARGET
- O
all O
at O
a O
high O
level. O

The O
work B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters O
was O
imperceptible, O
the O
dishes O
and O
dishes O
changed O
as O
if O
by O
themselves. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
work B-TARGET
of O
the O
manager O
Alexander. O

Thanks O
to O
him, O
our O
holiday O
has O
become O
a O
celebration, O
not O
a O
concern O
for O
guests O
and O
food. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
go O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
again. O

I O
will O
definitely O
advise O
friends O
and O
relatives, O
although O
some O
of O
them O
have O
seen O
them O
all! O

thank O
you! O

Excellent O
place! B-TARGET
08.04.2010 O
celebrated O
the O
wedding O
on O
the O
second O
floor, O
from O
the O
very O
first O
meeting O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Anna O
placed O
to O
herself, O
viewed O
a O
few O
more O
places O
and O
without O
delay O
decided O
to O
stop O
their O
choice O
at O
this O
relaxation O
café. O

I O
was O
chosen O
for O
1550 O
(it O
is O
more O
expensive) O
and O
I O
did O
not O
regret O
it, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
food, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
very O
delicious O
and O
beautifully O
disassembled, O
arranged, O
no O
one O
left O
hungry! O

All O
our O
requests O
and O
requests O
were O
met O
by O
the O
administration. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
was O
attentive O
during O
the O
cleaning O
of O
the O
table O
and O
was O
always O
ready, O
agreed O
with O
us O
the O
time O
of O
serving O
the O
hot O
snack O
and O
the O
main O
hot O
meal. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
alcohol O

were O
put O
together O
and O
we O
all O
took O
something O
on O
the O
same O
day O
(relatives O
helped) O
something O
for O
the O
next O
day. O

Very O
pleased O
with O
this O

Beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
pleasant O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
would O
love O
to O
come O
there O
for O
dinner O
in O
a O
romantic O
setting.) O

Thank O
you O
Anna O
for O
organizing O
such O
a O
wonderful O
celebration. O

On O
April O
17, O
2010, O
there O
was O
a O
family O
lunch. O

I O
chose O
this O
restaurant O
(or O
a O
cafe). O

And O
did O
not O
regret. O

Since O
we O
did O
not O
have O
any O
special O
requirements O
for O
the O
interior, O
except O
for O
an O
excellent O
view O
of B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
bay, I-TARGET
we O
got O
what O
we O
wanted. O

Non-obsessive O
music, B-TARGET
fairly O
decent O
waiters B-TARGET
(, O
the O
appliances O
do O
not O
disassemble O
and O
the O
wine O
does O
not O
pour). O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
very O
liked. O

Thanks O
to O
the B-TARGET
Chef! I-TARGET

For O
four O
people O
we O
ordered O
various O
salads O
and O
hot O
foods. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
large, O
everything O
is O
deliciously O
cooked, O
served O
on O
time. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
who O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
delicious O
lunch O
after O
a O
walk. O

Prices O
are O
very O
democratic. O

We O
visited O
your O
restaurant O
on O
April O
17. O

Even O
from O
the O
street O
noticed O
your O
wonderful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
decided O
to O
have O
dinner O
with O
you. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
liked O
was O
how O
your O
manager B-TARGET
Ilya O
met O
me, O
all O
as O
I O
love, O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
humor. O

After O
I O
was O
placed O
at O
the O
table, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
that O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
gently O
took O
my O
top O
clothes O
and O
hung O
them O
in O
my O
closet. O

Since O
you've O
been O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
I'm O
very O
grateful O
to O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
Valentine O
for O
the O
competent O
explanation O
of O
all O
my O
questions O
about O
the O
menu. O

And O
again O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
your O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
positive. O

Valentine O
radiated O
positive O
and O
greatly O
raised O
my O
mood O
after O
my O
working O
day O
(positives O
of O
waiters B-TARGET
especially O
in O
the O
evening O
time O
is O
now O
a O
great O
rarity). O

Having O
ordered O
the O
dishes, O
it O
was O
very O
unexpected O
to O
get O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
- O
a O
pastet O
from O
rye... O

Who O
sparked O
my O
waiting O
for O
the O
meals O
I O
ordered... O

Within O
fifteen O
minutes O
I O
had O
already O
your O
masterpieces. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
on O
the O
level... O

I O
left O
you O
full O
and O
satisfied. O

I O
hope O
your O
staff B-TARGET
is O
always O
as O
positive O
and O
kind. O

Good O
guys, O
I O
hope O
the O
management O
of O
the O
restaurant O
encourages O
this O
and O
my O
feedback O
will O
not O
go O
unnoticed... O

thank O
you! O

P.S. O
I O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
you. O

Only O
with O
friends. O

I O
really O
liked O
your O
kitchen, B-TARGET
I O
appreciated O
it O
because O
I O
am O
a O
cook. O

Thank O
you O
again! O

We O
visited O
Diana O
on O
04.02.2011 O
(seeking O
a O
place O
for O
a O
family O
celebration). O

Strangely O
enough, O
there O
were O
no O
visitors O
besides O
us, O
despite O
Friday O
night. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
welcoming, O
we O
felt O
at O
home O
from O
the O
doorstep. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
was O
very O
liked O
- O
solemn, O
refined, O
but O
does O
not O
pressure O
the O
pomp. O

On O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
bar O
are O
photos O
with O
the O
famous O
guests O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
hall O
is O
small, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
in O
noble O
red O
and O
blue O
tones, O
which O
creates O
a O
feeling O
of O
chamberiness O
and O
comfort. O

Particularly O
beautiful O
look O
decorative B-TARGET
windows I-TARGET
with O
night O
landscape! O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
thought-out O
and O
varied, O
wonderful O
desserts, B-TARGET
there O
are O
great O
offers O
of O
solemn O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
banquets, O
on O
order O
will O
make O
a O
cake B-TARGET
of O
any O
complexity. O

I O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
wine B-TARGET
card. I-TARGET

The O
wine, B-TARGET
which O
was O
recommended O
by O
the O
friendly O
owner B-TARGET
of O
the O
establishment, O
was O
above O
all O
praise! O

Everything O
we O
ate O
for O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Of O
the O
disadvantages O
- O
disappointed O
women's O
toilet B-TARGET
(the O
door O
lock O
did O
not O
work), O
and O
in O
general O
the O
appearance O
of O
the B-TARGET
hall I-TARGET
is O
somewhat O
simple O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
interior. O

In O
general, O
the O
warmest O
memories O
of O
visiting O
Diana B-TARGET
remained, O
we O
will O
definitely O
return O
there O
ourselves O
and O
can O
safely O
recommend O
this O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
both O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
and O
a O
banquet O
for O
30-35 O
people. O

The O
Destroyed O
Night O
( O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
the O
birthday O
and O
also O
the O
day O
of O
lovers O
(February O
14). O

I O
booked O
a O
table O
for O
a O
week. O

We O
arrived O
on O
time, O
did O
not O
remember O
us, O
long O
rushed O
in O
some O
records, O
hurra! O
found O
a O
note O
about O
the O
reserve O
table. O

The O
Village. O

The O
music B-TARGET
from O
the O
speakers O
at O
first O
just O
stunned, O
then O
nothing O
- O
used O
to O
it. O

The O
truth O
to O
talk O
calmly O
was O
not O
possible. O
(at O
the O
neighboring O
tables O
the O
couple O
also O
spoke O
loudly O
about O
the O
personal, O
trying O
to O
scream O
the O
dynamics). O

Interiors B-TARGET
on O
the O
third, O
well, O
didn’t O
actually O
come O
for O
that. O

Well, O
for O
the O
meat! O

We O
ordered O
a O
ribay O
(590 O
p) O
and O
a O
caré O
(about O
600 O
p), O
along O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
beers, O
in O
order O
to O
brighten O
the O
wait. O

I O
do O
not O
evaluate O
the O
kitchen O
- O
because O
we O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
try O
- O
for O
one O
and O
a O
half O
(!) O
hours O
of O
steaks O
we O
have O
never O
brought... O

We O
did O
not O
bring O
food O
and O
other O
guests O
sitting O
next O
to O
us O
who O
made O
the O
order O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

During O
all O
the O
time, O
the O
waiting O
approached O
us O
only O
twice O
- O
and O
then O
on O
insistent O
demand. O

When O
I O
got O
bored, O
I O
asked O
for O
an O
account. O

The O
administrator B-TARGET
approached, O
began O
to O
lump O
something O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
people O
are O
a O
lot O
(crossed), O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
cook B-TARGET
does O
not O
have O
time. O

They O
left O
hungry O
and O
upset. O

Do O
not O
go O
anymore. O

I O
hope O
the O
others O
are O
more O
lucky. O

A O
wonderful O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
opened O
up O
completely O
by O
chance, O
thanks O
to O
the O
group. O

I O
first O
ordered O
a O
table O
for O
my O
birthday O
three O
years O
ago. O

Now O
it O
is O
my O
favorite O
place. B-TARGET

I O
always O
go O
out O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
action. O

Eight O
to O
ten O
times, O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
real O
guilt. B-TARGET

An O
interesting O
interior. B-TARGET

Beautiful O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window. O

I O
recommend O
visiting O
those O
who O
have O
not O
been. O

Thanks O

service B-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

Hold O
the O
mark! O

You O
are O
wonderful!! O

Let’s O
go O
again O
this O
Saturday. O

Today, O
the O
company O
of O
three O
people O
were O
in O
this O
institution, O
by O
the O
way, O

is O
just O
great O
and O
like O
the O
idea O
clearly O
for O
the O
restaurant, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
space O
is O
quite O
small O
("non-smoking O
room O
with O
a O
view O
to O
the O
kitchen" O
and O
"smoking", O
and O
the O
"smoking" B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
completely O
absent, O
I O
even O
imagined O
that O
if O
there O
are O
several O
companies O
and O
smoke O
so O
tight, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
open O
the O
window O
from O
which O
to O
go, O
very O
blowing O
- O
to O
comfort O
right O
away! O

I O
went, O
hoping O
for O
good O
reviews O
about O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET

didn’t O
go O
wrong! O

the O
brand B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
of O
the O
largest O

again, O
did O

the O

of O
everything, O
the O
composition O
I O
will O
not O
mention, O
I O
remember O
only O
the O
taste O
- O
great! O

In O
general, O
it O
is O
quite O
cozy, O
simple, O
to O
beat O
the O

would O
somehow, O
and O
also O
to O
repair O

a O
very O

about O

Service B-TARGET
: O
Young, O
not O
experienced O
:), O
but O
very O
kindly, O
such O
a O
service B-TARGET
pleases O
me O
quite, O
more O
and O
not O
required. O

They O
were O
there O
at O
the O
end O
of O
January. O

The O
administrator-cassor-garderobber B-TARGET
(in O
one O
person) O
still O
even O
smiled. O

Two O
girls B-TARGET
in O
black O
costumes O
spent O
the O
whole O
evening O
in O
the O
area O
of O
the O
fireplace, O
without O
guiding O
or O
helping O
the O
waiters. B-TARGET

Just O
two O
statues O
with O
a O
boring O
face O
expression. O

Who O
are O
they? O

What O
are O
their O
functions? O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
forgot O
to O
order, O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
later O
came O
and O
asked. O

After O
half O
an O
hour, O
I O
didn’t O
see O
her O
at O
all. O

At O
the O
end, O
we O
ordered O
a O
dessert. O

After O
15 O
minutes, O
they O
learned O
that O
the O
pancotta O
would O
be O
ready O
in O
40 O
minutes. O

And O
Tiramisu B-TARGET
has O
only O
one O
left O
(Saturday O
about O
five). O

After O
the O
coffee, O
they O
asked O
for O
a O
bill. O

We O
waited O
very O
long, O
as O
the O
girl B-TARGET
(see O
above) O
dressed O
and O
dressed O
the O
guests. O

I O
brought O
the O
bill O
and O
waited O
for O
another O
15 O
minutes O
to O
deliver. O

We O
spent O
three O
hours O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
of O
which O
2 O
hours O
with O
a O
little O
waiting. O

Not O
liked O
at O
all. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small O
for O
not O
small O
prices. O

When O
we O
got O
out, O
my O
husband O
said, O
“The O
Snow O
Queen O
works O
here.” O

Per O
they O
were O
tired, O
or O
they O
were O
all O
in O
trouble? O

I O
do O
not O
know. O

There O
is O
no O
desire O
to O
come O
there O
anymore. O

P.S. O
Interior B-TARGET
of O
pleasant O
beige O
shades. O

But O
the O
sofas B-TARGET
were O
all O
dirty O
(no O
smoking O
room)! O

very O
much O
liked! O

We O
were O
welcomed O
and O
brought O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
menu O
and O
dish O
were O
quite O
smooth. O

Because O
of O
the O
high O
ceilings O
there O
is O
no O
smell O
of O
cigarette B-TARGET
smoke I-TARGET
- O
100 O
points O
just O
for O
this! O

Excellent O
music, B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
(especially O
Indian B-TARGET
cuisine). I-TARGET

The O
steak B-TARGET
is O
impeccable, O
although O
the O
sauce, B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion, O
should O
be O
different. O

Of O
the O
disadvantages O
I O
can O
only O
note O
that O
the O
closet B-TARGET
was O
cool O
and O
the O
clothes O
were O
quite O
cold. O

The O
impression O
is O
great!! O

Particularly O
democratic O
seemed O
the O
account O
- O
pleasantly O
surprised O
:) O

I O
recommend O
it!! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Daikiri B-TARGET
many O
times O
and O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
that O
this O
is O
the O
best O
bar B-TARGET
in O
the O
city! O

First, O
we O
can O
not O
forget O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
bar O
and O
the O
very O
friendly O
and O
welcoming O
staff! B-TARGET

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
success O
factors O
for O
any O
institution! O

The O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
just O
wonderful O
and, O
which O
is O
especially O
pleasant, O
at O
absolutely O
reasonable O
prices! O

A O
great O
place O
to O
have O
a O
good O
time O
with O
your O
friends O
and O
enjoy O
delicious O
cocktails! B-TARGET

It O
is O
best O
to O
reserve O
a O
place O
in O
advance!) O

I O
was O
in O
the O
restaurant O
on O
February O
10 O
on O
coupons, O
company O
of O
5 O
people, O
occasion O
- O
to O
celebrate O
the O
birthday. O

It O
was O
great. O

If O
I O
honestly O
don’t O
understand O
why O
there O
are O
bad O
reviews O
here, O
maybe O
I’m O
just O
lucky. O

I O
am O
a O
person O
in O
moderation, O
but O
I O
have O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about, O
I O
will O
talk O
about O
the O
plus: O

1) O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
city, O
near O
the O
subway O
- O
better O
not O
to O
imagine O

2) O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
comfortable, O
the O
music B-TARGET
does O
not O
fade O
(although O
sitting O
next O
to O
the O
column), O
the O
playlist B-TARGET
pleases O
the O
ear O
(lounge O
if O
I O
am O
not O
mistaken) O

3) O
The O
service B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

Our O
waitress B-TARGET
(Ilia) O
was O
fun, O
friendly O
and O
very... O
helpful O
and O
proactive O
(sorry O
I O
didn't O
pick O
up O
words O
in O
Russian), O
professionally O
helped O
with O
the O
selection O
of O
the O
menu, O
such O
a O
tea O
to O
leave O
one O
pleasure. O

We O
also O
ordered O
Italian B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Japanese I-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
everyone O
liked O
it. O

5) O
prices O
do O
not O
bite, O
considering O
that O
this O
is O
the O
city B-TARGET
center I-TARGET
and O
compared O
with O
other O
sushi B-TARGET
bars O
=) O

I O
will O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
my O
friends, O
I O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
come O
again. O

On O
Saturday O
evening O
we O
celebrated O
our O
birthday. O

Wasabi O
was O
tired, O
wanted O
something O
new, O
went O
to O
this O
institution O
because O
it O
is O
relatively O
close O
to O
home. O

I O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
not O
all: O
the O
spicy O
soup B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
is O
peeled, O
but O
the O
pork B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
sauce O
with O
the O
shrimp O
is O
not O
very O
- O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
tasteless, O
tiramisu B-TARGET
tasty O
- O
rarely O
where O
it O
is O
well O
cooked. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
non-obsessive O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
do O
not O
have O
to O
wait, O
friendly O
and O
responsive. O

Interior B-TARGET
for O
the O
amateur. O

I O
liked O
the O
place, B-TARGET
but O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
very O
loud, O
I O
didn't O
hear O
what O
they O
said, O
it's O
a O
minus, O
but O
I O
hope O
when O
I O
come O
next O
time O
it O
will O
be O
quieter) O

We O
walk, O
we O
walk O
and O
we O
will O
walk! O

Long O
sought O
for O
a O
jazz O
club, O
in O
which O
you O
can O
not O
only O
sit O
at O
the O
bar O
stand, O
but O
also O
deliciously O
eat O
at O
the O
tables O
and O
talk. O

I O
found. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
desire O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
table O
rather O
than O
at O
the O
bar, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
book O
in O
advance. O

In O
the O
evening O
there O
is O
always O
a O
great O
program, B-TARGET
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
jazz. B-TARGET

They O
often O
go O
out O
to O
dance, O
many O
professionally O
dance, O
it O
is O
always O
nice O
to O
watch O
them. O

Enjoying O
and O
lovers O
drink O
strongly, O
with O
such, O
of O
course, O
not O
very O
fun O
to O
sit O
next O
to. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
always O
good, O
everything O
comes O
quickly. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
always O
delicious. O

I O
ordered O
roast, O
fish O
and O
meat. O

Good O
wine B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
choice. O

Very O
pleasant O
design, B-TARGET
comfortable O
and O
atmospheric. O

Great O
place O
for O
jazz O
and O
live O
music O
lovers! O

A O
great O
place! B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
super, O
very O
comfortable O
cabins B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
soft I-TARGET
pillows. I-TARGET

I O
used O
to O
go O
there O
often O
for O
dinner O
after O
work. O

To O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
of O
claims O
almost O
never O
was O
all O
delicious, O
except O
that O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
and O
fruits B-TARGET
could O
be O
of O
the O
best O
quality O
since O
it O
is O
an O
oriental O
restaurant. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
always O
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

A O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
good O
rest. O

Invited O
to O
Amaren, O
a O
friend O
celebrated O
his O
birthday. O

I O
will O
immediately O
say O
that O
I O
will O
not O
name O
a O
single O
dish, O
because O
salads O
and O
meat O
and O
cheese O
plates O
have O
already O
been O
ordered, O
and O
the O
hot O
I O
did O
not O
order, O
but O
I O
managed O
to O
pull O
a O
piece O
of O
steak B-TARGET
from O
the O
dish....mm...liked, O
delicious. O

The O
salads B-TARGET
and O
snacks B-TARGET
were O
also O
pleasantly O
delighted: O
everything O
was O
beautifully O
decorated O
and O
taste O
great. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
fix O
was O
the O
salty B-TARGET
cucumbers, I-TARGET
because O
they O
were O
totally O
tasteless. O

Our O
company O
was O
placed O
behind O
the O
slopes, O
so O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
lot O
of O
vacationers O
did O
not O
hinder O
us. O

It O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
we O
were O
served O
by O
an O
unknown O
man, O
so O
quickly O
the O
dirty B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
disappeared O
from O
the O
table O
and O
drinks O
were O
poured. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
cozy, O
very O
pleased O
to O
have O
a O
separate O
room B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
karaoke. I-TARGET

Singing O
until O
four O
in O
the O
morning. O

Thank O
you, O
it O
was O
Vanderbilt. O

He O
celebrated O
his O
birthday O
with O
a O
small O
company. O

Generally, O
it O
is O
okay, O
but O
without O
enthusiasm. O

Interiors B-TARGET
are O
worth O
noting. O

Light O
old O
furniture, B-TARGET
banks B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
compotes, I-TARGET
crops, I-TARGET
interesting. O

I O
like O
home O
drinks. B-TARGET

Hot B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
but O
small O
portions. B-TARGET

Dessert B-TARGET
Chocolate I-TARGET
box I-TARGET
and O
carrot B-TARGET
torso I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
Philadelphia I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
is O
very, O
very. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
smoked. O

The O
non-smoking O
room O
was O
occupied O
for O
the O
wedding, O
I O
had O
to O
book O
a O
table O
in O
the O
smoking O
room. O

Disadvantages: O
There O
is O
no O
closet. B-TARGET

It O
is O
not O
pleasant O
when O
during O
a O
meal O
someone O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
restaurant O
stands O
and O
waits O
in O
the O
top O
clothes O
of O
their O
friends O
at O
the O
table. O

The B-TARGET
hangers I-TARGET
are O
overloaded O
with O
clothes O
and O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
them. O

There O
are O
many O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
catch O
one. O

Maybe O
we O
were O
in O
the O
peak O
hour. O

Drinks O
(not O
cocktails) O
awaited O
30 O
minutes O
from O
the O
time O
of O
the O
order. O

The O
girls-administrators B-TARGET
do O
not O
have O
badges O
and O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
distinguish O
them O
from O
the O
guests. O

The O
weight O
of O
the O
portions O
is O
not O
indicated O
in O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

I O
have O
to O
ask O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
she O
closes O
her O
eyes O
and O
stressfully O
remembers O
what O
the O
dish O
looks O
like. O

Churchhel B-TARGET
didn’t O
like O
it, O
it O
was O
frozen O
and O
tasteless. O

I O
decided O
to O
open O
another O
Italian O
restaurant. O

I O
recommend O
Super O
Mario. O

They O
went O
there. O

They O
were O
not O
disappointed, O
but O
they O
were O
not O
satisfied. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
not O
very: O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
rather O
boring, O
there O
were O
few O
places O
and O
only O
one O
table O
was O
occupied O
- O
and O
it O
was O
on O
a O
weekend O
night... O

But O
I O
decided O
to O
drink O
coffee. O

I O
ordered O
a O
latte B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
basil I-TARGET
- O
served O
quickly, O
very O
delicious!! O

My O
husband O
took O
green B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
good O
too. O

We O
softened O
and O
decided O
to O
eat: O
ordered O
cream B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
mushroom, I-TARGET
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
tasteless, O
but O
though O
the O
portion B-TARGET
is O
large. O

My O
husband’s O
chicken B-TARGET
broth I-TARGET
was O
literally O
3 O
tablespoons O
– O
very O
little. O

The B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
basket I-TARGET
is O
boring O
and O
not O
delicious. O

Lazarus B-TARGET
is O
like O
her O
husband. O

but O
I O
liked O
tiramisu B-TARGET
- O
delicious, O
but O
served O
badly O
in O
a O
glass. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
much. O

Drinks B-TARGET
are O
really O
delicious. O

A O
huge O
toilet. B-TARGET

very O
clean, O
carefully, O
the O
towels O
are O
all O
kinds O
and O
spacious O
- O
but O
a O
good O
toilet B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
important O
for O
the O
restaurant, O
I O
think. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
polite. O

You O
can O
put O
them O
four O
on O
the O
fifth O
scale. O

It O
was O
embarrassing O
that O
they O
washed O
the O
floors O
in O
the O
room O
at O
the O
entrance O
- O
and O
we O
watched O
it... O
as O
if O
not O
very O
much. O

The O
account O
is O
normal, O
not O
very O
expensive, O
but O
also O
inexpensive. O

In O
general, O
once O
looked O
at O
it...there O
are O
better O
places, O
for O
this O
money O
even O
more. O

So O
we O
will O
go O
back O
there. O

Hello O
everyone, O
we O
were O
recently O
at O
a O
restaurant, O
we O
live O
nearby. O

We O
went O
for O
dinner, O
we O
were O
happy, O
everything O
was O
fine. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
spacious O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very O
cozy. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
accepted O
the O
order O
and O
didn’t O
wait O
long. O

Our O
company O
is O
different, O
so O
the O
meals O
were O
ordered O
differently, O
whoever. O

Everything O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
delicious, O
salads, B-TARGET
soup, B-TARGET
lamb B-TARGET
sausages I-TARGET
– O
just O
a O
song. O

The O
puppy B-TARGET
went O
to O
Hurricane! O

With O
a O
beer! O

Beer B-TARGET
is O
great, O
maybe O
they O
cook O
it O
and O
not O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
but O
to O
the O
taste O
qualities O
of O
claims O
no O
one O
had, O
everything O
fresh. O

All O
the O
guys O
were O
satisfied O
and O
satisfied. O

Even O
our O
child, O
who O
ordered O
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
also O
said O
that O
it O
was O
delicious, O
so O
that O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
can O
drink O
a O
company O
of O
beer O
and O
the O
family O
just O
have O
dinner. O

I O
recommend O
it))) O

The O
first O
time O
I O
wanted O
to O
write O
a O
review O
of O
the B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
because O
it O
left O
a O
really O
pleasant O
impression... O

very O
cozy O
interior O
and O
scenic O
location, O
although O
the O
building O
of O
the O
sberbank O
nearby O
spoils O
the O
picture... O
but O
this O
is O
another O
matter. O

from O
the O
kitchen O
- O
tried O
two O
dishes: O
a O
baked O
cake O
and O
a O
paste O
with O
spinach. O

Doraed B-TARGET
worthy, O
very O
liked O
sauce, B-TARGET
which O
makes O
up O
80% O
of O
the O
success O
of O
the O
dish. O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
impressed O
a O
little O
less, O
because O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
was O
not O
perfectly O
delicate O
as O
dreamed. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
not O
really O
so O
big, O
but O
all O
very O
carefully O
and O
in O
the O
right O
amount. O
perfect O
to O
feel O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
dish, O
but O
not O
to O
get O
saturated. O

Black B-TARGET
Caesar I-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
decent, O
made O
with O
taste. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleased: O
when O
I O
was O
cleaned O
the O
fish O
- O
I O
was O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
- O
it O
is O
already O
the O
level. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
in O
ananas B-TARGET
fresh I-TARGET
for O
300 O
r O
added O
sugar, O
if O
this O
is O
so O
- O
it O
is O
rather O
a O
minus, O
because O
it O
kills O
all O
the O
natural O
taste... O

And O
most O
of O
all, O
I O
liked O
the O
fact O
that O
the B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
clearly O
ready O
for O
constant O
improvement O
and O
respect O
their O
client. O

It O
buys O
the O
most. O

I O
want O
to O
go O
back O
and O
try O
a O
couple O
of O
desserts O
and O
soup-puree O
with O
spinach...for O
the O
start=) O

This O
is O
a O
restaurant O
that O
I O
am O
not O
ashamed O
to O
recommend. O

I O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
institution O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
to O
this O
sports O
bar O
to O
just O
somewhere O
to O
rest O
in O
the O
afternoon O
between O
business O
and O
look O
at O
something. O

As O
usual, O
I O
took O
Caesar’s O
salad O
and O
ice O
cream O
with O
latte O
coffee. O

Well O
when O
in O
the O
bar O
can O
cook O
coffee B-TARGET
deliciously O
without O
burning O
it O
and O
everything O
else O
was O
done O
well O
and O
skillfully, O
orders O
brought O
me O
very O
quickly, O
considering O
that O
there O
were O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
there O
during O
the O
day. O

There O
was O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
relaxation O
and O
relaxation O
from O
everything. O

The O
right O
interior, B-TARGET
like O
in O
a O
normal O
male O
pub O
with O
adequate O
prices O
and O
beautiful O
waitresses. B-TARGET

The O
only O
disadvantage O
for O
me O
is O
that O
the O
pub O
is O
quite O
far O
from O
home, O
but O
still O
the O
pluses O
are O
much O
more O
and O
now O
I O
know O
where O
to O
watch O
football O
and O
where O
to O
go O
in O
the O
evening) O

I O
have O
long O
wanted O
to O
visit O
this O
place. O

09.05.2014 O
table O
ordered O
by O
phone O
2 O
hours O
before O
the O
visit. O

There O
were O
plenty O
of O
free O
tables. O

I O
will O
be O
brief O
in O
my O
remarks. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
all O
super O
- O
10 O
points. O

The O
staff: B-TARGET
polite O
and O
welcoming. O

Interior: B-TARGET
everything O
simple, O
carefully, O
without O
excesses. O

The O
amount O
of O
the O
cheque: O
3500-3700 O
(+two O
glasses O
of O
wine). O

There O
is O
a O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
which O
is O
undoubtedly O
important. O

The O
most O
unpleasant O
thing O
happened O
during O
dinner. O

It O
was O
like O
a O
bad O
movie! O

My O
companion O
brought O
the O
ordered O
dish, O
he O
was O
a O
nice O
bit O
of O
it, O
from O
all O
the O
soul, O
whispered O
(as O
he O
likes O
it O
at O
home), O
took O
a O
knife O
and O
a O
fork, O
and O
here O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
runs O
with O
the O
words O
"you O
haven't O
had O
time O
yet?" O

It O
turns O
out O
a O
couple O
at O
the O
neighboring O
table O
ordered O
the O
same O
dish O
and O
it O
was O
intended O
for O
them. O

You O
will O
not O
believe! O

After O
we O
took O
away O
the O
food, O
this O
dish O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
couple O
at O
the O
neighboring O
table! O

No O
words! O

The O
mood O
of O
the O
evening O
dinner O
was O
shaken. O

I O
understand O
that O
all O
people O
can O
be O
mistaken. O

But! O

Both O
we O
and O
the O
couple O
in O
this O
situation O
looked O
stupid. O

After O
all, O
you O
could O
apologize O
to O
the O
couple O
and O
ask O
them O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
longer O
until O
the O
dish O
was O
ready. O

I O
think O
that O
was O
the O
only O
possible O
way O
out. O

Should O
I O
go O
to O
this O
establishment? O

Maybe, O
but O
only O
for O
lunch. O
