Good O
hour. O

My O
name O
is O
Vlada! O

I O
was O
with O
my O
young O
man O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
his O
friends O
celebrating O
my O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant O
just O
the O
other O
day. O

The O
good O
service B-TARGET
met O
us O
at O
the O
maitre B-TARGET
d'awn I-TARGET
and O
drove O
us O
to O
the O
table, O
which O
was O
great O
for O
us. O

He O
was O
in O
a O
cozy O
corner B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
main O
hall, O
muffled B-TARGET
light I-TARGET
is O
the O
main O
part O
of O
this O
restaurant O
there's O
no O
daylight O
lighting. O
That O
was O
a O
big O
positive O
for O
our O
birthday! O

It's O
just O
that O
we O
came O
in O
at O
four O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
so O
it O
was O
a O
nice O
evening... O

We O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
nice O
meals B-TARGET
on O
our O
not O
big O
candy, O
so O
I O
ordered O
some O
snails, B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
really O
good, O
and O
I O
didn't O
think O
it O
was O
a O
very O
expensive O
300 O
rubles, O
so O
my O
young O
man O
ordered O
some O
meat B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
mangal, O
which O
they're O
full O
of, O
which O
he's O
not O
usually O
comfortable O
with, O
and O
then O
his O
friends O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
meat B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
mangal, O
too! O

Towards O
the O
evening, O
we O
were O
warned O
that O
there O
would O
be O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
so O
happy O
with O
this O
unexpected O
surprise, O
we O
had O
just O
the O
time O
to O
dance, O
and O
there O
was O
such O
a O
beautiful O
voice B-TARGET
of O
a O
soloist...!!! O

Anyway, O
we're O
insanely O
pleased O
to O
have O
spent O
the O
evening O
at O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
so O
we're O
all O
advised) O

We O
were O
in O
Dita's O
last O
week O
with O
a O
friend. O

They O
came O
by O
by O
accident, O
both O
of O
them O
didn't O
go O
to O
Chinese O
restaurants, O
decided O
to O
try O
what O
it O
was. O

What O
you O
didn't O
know O
to O
order O
was O
a O
waitress's O
taste. O

They O
weren't O
disappointed O
at O
all! O

My O
friend's O
got O
a O
boat, O
I O
got O
a O
pork O
pork O
in O
Peking. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
unusual. O

It'll O
be O
interesting O
to O
come O
in O
and O
try O
something O
else. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
interior: B-TARGET
there B-TARGET
is O
no O
quiet, O
no O
noisy O
company O
(not O
at O
least O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
visit), O
a O
very O
pleasant O
and O
comfortable O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
all O
in O
better O
traditions. O

We're O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
establishment. B-TARGET

I've O
been O
to O
this O
place O
a O
few O
times, O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
about O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
the O
best. O

Amazing O
salmon B-TARGET
pasta, I-TARGET
delicious O
soup, B-TARGET
great O
desserts. B-TARGET

Last O
time O
I O
was O
with O
my O
friends, O
everyone O
was O
happy O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
food. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
isn't O
bad, O
a O
few O
rooms B-TARGET
of O
different O
tastes O
and O
company. O

Anyway, O
it's O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
lunch O
and O
hang O
out O
with O
friends. O

Yesterday, O
they O
celebrated O
their O
birthday O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
going O
there O
in O
two O
days O
for O
exploration. O

We O
both O
enjoyed O
it, O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
invite O
guests O
there, O
one O
of O
whom O
was O
a O
great O
expert O
and O
critic O
on O
the O
food O
side. O

I O
just O
want O
to O
say O
that O
she O
didn't O
have O
to O
criticize O
because O
she O
stayed, O
like O
all O
the O
other O
guests, O
very O
happy! O

The O
French-style O
interior B-TARGET
with O
pleasant O
lighting B-TARGET
on O
the O
tables, O
the O
service B-TARGET
without O
the O
imposition O
of O
extra O
food O
and O
drinks O
(the O
waitress O
Anna), O
everything O
happened O
clearly O
and O
quickly. O

And O
there's O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
the O
quality B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
performance I-TARGET
of O
the O
dishes! B-TARGET

They O
took O
all O
the O
different O
salads B-TARGET
and O
the O
hot B-TARGET
ones, I-TARGET
and O
everyone O
was O
very O
happy. O

It's O
beautifully O
decorated O
and O
cooked O
right O
before O
you O
serve O
it O
on O
the O
table. O

I O
think O
this O
little O
restaurant B-TARGET
we O
don't O
know O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
town, O
Veritas, O
is O
gonna O
be O
our O
family O
meeting O
place! O

Now, O
on O
a O
question O
from O
people O
we O
know, O
which O
restaurant O
to O
go O
to O
with O
guests O
from O
Moscow O
or O
celebrate O
their O
birthday? O
We're O
gonna O
recommend O
Veritas. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
for O
their O
warm O
and O
quality O
reception. B-TARGET

Let's O
see O
if O
you O
can O
make O
any O
further O
progress. O

We O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
on O
25.08.12. O

After O
the O
visit, O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
come O
again. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
flaws O
in O
both O
waiters' B-TARGET
work O
and O
meals. B-TARGET
1. O

Been O
with O
the O
baby, O
ordered O
pizza O
from O
the O
baby's O
menu. O

To O
the O
great O
surprise O
of O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
(one O
more O
time O
from O
the O
baby O
menu! O
) O
was O
so O
sharp O
that O
adults O
could O
not O
eat O
it, O
let O
alone O
the O
baby. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
commented O
in O
general O
that O
the O
baby O
menu O
is O
for O
adults O
who O
want O
to O
order O
small O
meals, O
not O
for O
children. O
:) O
) O
2. O

They O
asked O
me O
to O
bring O
some O
regular O
apple O
juice, O
not O
fresh-pressed, O
fresh-squeezed, O
I O
had O
to O
return O
it. O

They O
asked O
me O
to O
bring O
a O
"cooked O
juice O
in O
a O
big O
glass O
+ O
sodaed O
water" O
juice O
in O
a O
small O
glass O
of O
water O
forgot. O
4. O

Asked O
the O
waiter O
to O
help O
me O
pick O
out O
two O
courses. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
said O
"we're O
good" O
and O
couldn't O
help O
the O
choice. O

For O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
score O
is O
three, O
because O
of O
the O
whole O
order, O
only O
the O
panacotes B-TARGET
liked O
it. O

Caesar's B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
wasn't O
so O
good, O
plus O
a O
very O
spicy O
pizza B-TARGET
from O
the O
baby O
menu. O

For O
service B-TARGET
3, O
because O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
confused O
the O
orders, O
couldn't O
help O
with O
the O
choice O
(or O
didn't O
want O
the O
client O
asking O
for O
help O
to O
decide, O
he O
didn't O
want O
to O
hear O
"everything O
good, O
take O
everything"). O

And O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
children's O
menu O
wasn't O
for O
the O
kids, O
"killed" O
at O
all. O

On O
the O
plus O
side, O
I'd O
like O
to O
celebrate O
the O
babysitter B-TARGET
in O
the O
children's O
room, O
a O
very O
nice O
girl, B-TARGET
the O
kid O
really O
liked O
it. O

I O
didn't O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
when O
I O
was O
a O
kid, O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
it O
used O
to O
be, O
but O
right O
now O
it's O
a O
pretty, O
cozy O
place B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
kitchen. B-TARGET

The O
first O
visit O
to O
Cheburek O
a O
month O
ago O
was O
to O
celebrate O
a O
previous O
wedding O
with O
friends. O

The O
administration B-TARGET
kindly O
provided O
us O
with O
a O
new O
feast O
hall, O
where O
we O
closed O
down, O
turned O
on O
our O
music, O
smoked O
kale, O
had O
fun, O
and O
no O
one O
prevented O
us. O

All O
the O
friends O
liked O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
service, B-TARGET
too O
(the B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
great). O

I O
was O
most O
pleased O
that O
the O
administration B-TARGET
met O
us O
and O
made O
a O
good O
discount O
on O
the O
party O
:) O

A O
week O
later, O
my O
friend O
went O
back O
to O
Cheburek B-TARGET
with O
her O
family, O
where O
they O
celebrated O
their O
father's O
anniversary. O

We're O
also O
coming O
back O
here O
over O
and O
over O
again. O

The O
only O
thing O
that's O
upsetting O
is O
the O
price O
increase. O

Prices O
have O
changed O
twice O
in O
the O
last O
month. O

They're O
growing O
a O
little O
bit, O
but O
still O
the O
cost O
of O
dinner, B-TARGET
and O
for O
two O
of O
us O
with O
each O
visit, O
we're O
getting O
higher O
and O
higher. O

But O
without O
that, O
of O
course, O
there's O
no O
place. O

I O
can O
recommend O
from O
the O
kitchen: O
chebureca B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
solugun I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
green I-TARGET
(magic!), O
eggplant B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
of O
course, O
hinkals, B-TARGET
and O
probably O
lamb's B-TARGET
feet I-TARGET
(I O
don't O
remember O
the O
exact O
name O
of O
the O
dish). O

All O
of O
this O
will O
leave O
no O
one O
indifferent, O
very O
tasty O
and O
authentic!) O

I O
went O
to O
this O
place O
five O
times. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
made O
me O
go O
back O
there O
was O
a O
good O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Carpacho O
is O
served O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
balsams O
and O
butter. O

Nice O
choice O
of O
wine. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice: O
there's O
a O
wardrobe, B-TARGET
sofas, B-TARGET
muffled O
light, O
non-intrusive O
music B-TARGET
(even O
once O
came O
across O
a O
saxophonist), O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere... B-TARGET

But! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
disgusting! O

A O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
spoke O
to O
us O
exclusively O
on O
"you" O
will O
always O
be O
remembered, O
and O
when O
a O
comment O
was O
made, O
he O
told O
us O
that O
he O
had O
an O
argument O
with O
his O
girlfriend O
and O
that O
he O
was O
in O
a O
disgusting O
mood! O

Next O
time, O
we're O
as O
lucky O
as O
we O
are. O

My O
husband O
ordered O
a O
steak O
and O
we've O
been O
waiting O
for O
him O
for O
over O
an O
hour! O

When O
our O
waitress B-TARGET
finally O
agreed O
to O
show O
up O
(we O
were O
almost O
at O
the O
entrance), O
we O
refused O
the O
steak, O
but O
he O
magically O
ended O
up O
on O
the O
table O
in O
five O
minutes O
and O
had O
to O
explain O
to O
the O
waitress O
for O
a O
long O
time O
that O
no O
one O
would O
eat O
it O
anymore!.... O

The O
summary O
is O
as O
follows: O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
generally O
excellent, O
the O
prices O
do O
not O
bite, O
but O
the O
replacement O
of O
staff B-TARGET
should O
be O
seriously O
considered... O

Saturday O
night, O
they O
came O
by O
the O
company O
at O
the O
Dolce O
Itali O
cafe O
for O
coffee O
and O
cakes. O

There O
were O
only O
fifteen O
and O
nine, O
and O
the O
cafe O
turns O
out O
to O
close O
at O
exactly O
nine O
o'clock. O

We O
were O
kindly O
offered O
a O
restaurant, O
and O
the O
cakes O
promised O
to O
be O
there. O

That's O
how O
we O
met O
the O
Italian O
restaurant. O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
a O
room O
full O
of O
them. O

Only O
a O
smoking O
table O
could O
be O
found O
for O
us, O
but O
it O
didn't O
bother O
us O
much, O
because O
the O
ventilation B-TARGET
is O
working. O

We O
liked O
what O
we O
ordered. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
calm, O
made O
with O
taste, O
but O
not O
very O
fine. O

I O
think O
it's O
better O
for O
the O
company O
than O
for O
the O
two O
of O
us O
to O
come. O

As O
for O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
at O
the O
beginning O
forgot O
about O
us, O
had O
to O
squeal O
to O
make O
an O
order. O

But O
otherwise, O
it's O
polite O
and O
warning. O

Caesar's O
salad O
needed O
sauce O
without O
anchovies. O

First, O
the O
cook B-TARGET
said O
they O
could O
only O
offer O
mayonnaise, B-TARGET
that O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
the O
same O
for O
everyone O
in O
the O
morning. O

About O
ten O
minutes O
later, O
he O
ran O
back O
and O
promised O
to O
do O
it O
better. O

Anyway, O
let's O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place. B-TARGET

I'll O
make O
sure O
we O
try O
more O
Italian O
food. O

We've O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
Italian O
restaurant O
with O
our O
wife O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

What O
if O
italy O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
them? O

We O
stopped O
by O
for O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago. O

The O
table O
wasn't O
ordered. O

There's O
nothing O
negative O
about O
the O
service-- B-TARGET
it's O
fast, O
everybody's O
out, O
they're O
asking O
if O
they O
like O
everything. O

Nice. O

An O
amateur O
interior, B-TARGET
but O
nice O
and O
convenient. O

The O
food's B-TARGET
good. O

It's O
good, O
it's O
not O
that O
expensive. O

The O
swimmer's B-TARGET
original, O
but... O

I O
didn't O
like O
it O
personally, O
though O
it O
wasn't O
a O
bad O
idea. O

Girls O
clearly O
like O
it. O

I O
personally O
expected O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
meat B-TARGET
in O
a O
restaurant O
like O
this O
on O
a O
mangal. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
there's O
one O
barbecue B-TARGET
out O
of O
every O
kind O
of O
meat, O
basically O
enough, O
but O
I O
want O
to O
see O
something O
unusual. O

The O
first O
visit O
to O
Dacha O
was O
as O
part O
of O
the O
search O
for O
a O
restaurant O
for O
a O
wedding O
feast. O

Right O
from O
the O
doorstep, O
a O
friendly O
attitude. B-TARGET

A O
very O
polite O
and O
pleasant O
man B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
wardrobe. O

Smile, O
the O
mood O
is O
improving! O

Called O
us O
the O
administrator, B-TARGET
the O
nicest O
girl, B-TARGET
told O
us O
everything, O
showed O
us O
no O
questions, O
even O
looked O
the O
edge O
of O
their O
eyes O
into O
a O
small O
room O
(at O
which O
time O
the O
feast O
began). O

The O
coordinates O
were O
left, O
and O
the O
same O
evening O
the O
menu O
was O
received O
from O
the O
post O
office. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
girls I-TARGET
all O
say O
hello O
and O
smile, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
amazing. O

We O
decided O
to O
come O
back O
for O
lunch. O

A O
welcome O
reunion B-TARGET
at O
the O
wardrobe. O

Pleasant O
compliment O
in O
the O
cold O
weather, O
waiting O
for O
the O
order O
to O
get O
some O
hot O
tea, B-TARGET
amazing! O

The O
waitress's B-TARGET
girl O
(in O
the O
check O
Louisa O
wrote) O
is O
polite, O
non-addictive, O
quality. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
good! O

Your O
coptile O
meat B-TARGET
is O
amazing, O
delicious! O

They're B-TARGET
big. O

They're O
very O
happy! O

Doubts O
about O
choosing O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
wedding O
have O
not O
arisen, O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
on O
the O
most O
important O
day O
of O
our O
lives O
we O
too O
will O
be O
satisfied, O
this O
week O
we O
go O
to O
order O
:). O

I O
suggest O
you O
all O
go O
to O
this O
wonderful O
place! B-TARGET

It's O
the O
first O
time O
we've O
been O
with O
a O
young O
man O
today. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
one O
thing-- O
find O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
everyone O
really O
needs O
to O
go O
and O
have O
a O
good O
time O
in O
a O
quiet, O
cozy O
environment. B-TARGET

It's O
really O
nice, O
romantic O
candles B-TARGET
in O
the O
water O
on O
every O
table, O
comfortable O
chairs, B-TARGET
muffled B-TARGET
light, I-TARGET
music, B-TARGET
aroma B-TARGET
even... O
all O
right. O

Japanese B-TARGET
cuisine-- I-TARGET
5 O
plus-- O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
rip O
off O
the O
flats) B-TARGET

European B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
doesn't O
lag O
behind...) O
everybody O
at O
the O
top O
for O
a O
pretty O
low O
price O
is O
delicious. O
And O
the O
service.. B-TARGET
nice O
girls, B-TARGET
very O
quickly O
ordered, O
everything's O
great. O

Cocatels B-TARGET
and O
alcohol B-TARGET
show O
that O
they're O
not O
diluted, O
and O
they're O
also O
5+. O
In O
general, O
there's O
one O
more O
thing, O
and O
there's O
more O
to O
it O
than O
once. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
on O
the O
Day O
of O
all O
the O
lovers O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
video O
of O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
we O
decided O
to O
go. O

The O
high-level O
interior, B-TARGET
at O
our O
entrance, O
was O
met O
by O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
and O
offered O
to O
choose O
the O
table O
we O
liked O
and O
warned O
us O
that O
the O
hottest O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
longer O
because O
the O
restaurant O
wasn't O
a O
small O
crowd, O
but O
it O
didn't O
embarrass O
us O
because O
we O
were O
warned O
in O
advance, O
and O
that's O
not O
very O
important. O

The B-TARGET
quality I-TARGET
of O
the O
kitchen O
was O
without O
comment, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
rather O
careful O
in O
our O
view, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
obvious O
that O
some O
fuss O
was O
present. O

In O
general, O
we O
remained O
under O
a O
good O
impression O
of O
our O
evening. O

Thank O
you. O

Yesterday, O
Monday, O
February O
14, O
went O
to O
this O
place, O
which O
I O
didn't O
know O
before. O

It's B-TARGET
a O
nice, O
cozy O
environment. O

Of O
course, O
like O
any O
other O
cafe, O
there O
are O
tables O
that O
aren't O
cozy, O
but O
you're O
not O
gonna O
please O
everyone, O
and O
I O
like O
the O
situation. B-TARGET

It O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
as O
thorough O
as O
possible, O
and O
it O
is O
encouraging. O

The O
administrator B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
polite. O

At O
the O
cafe, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
feel O
that O
people O
want O
to O
work O
and O
that O
they O
like O
it, O
and O
that's O
the O
most O
important O
thing!) O

There O
were O
no O
delays O
in O
the O
delivery O
of O
dishes/drinks. O

The O
only O
surprise O
was O
when O
they O
brought O
me O
a O
spoon O
instead O
of O
a O
dessert O
fork O
for O
dessert, O
but O
it O
didn't O
cause O
any O
trouble. O

But O
you'd O
like O
to O
try O
this O
dessert. B-TARGET
Mm-hmm. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
we O
liked O
it. O

Sushi, B-TARGET
punked I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
dryers I-TARGET
or O
something, O
it O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
admiration, O
because O
it O
was O
really O
tasty. O

In O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
cafe B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
like O
price O
and O
quality. O

There's O
everything O
you O
need. O

In O
general, O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
leaves O
very O
pleasant O
memories. O

Everyone O
is O
very O
encouraged O
to O
go O
and O
try O
the O
local O
Japanese B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

On O
the O
second B-TARGET
floor, I-TARGET
it's O
very O
convenient O
for O
the O
company O
to O
be O
on O
the O
couch. B-TARGET

Recently, O
it O
was O
a O
birthday O
party O
in O
Sana'am. O

I O
loved O
it O
so O
much. O

The O
guests O
love O
it. O

Beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
good O
maintenance, B-TARGET
quick, O
non-intrusive. O

I O
liked O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

There's O
both O
Eastern O
and O
European O
and O
Japanese. O

Since O
the O
tastes O
of O
our O
company O
are O
very O
different, O
everyone O
has O
found O
a O
suitable O
dish B-TARGET
for O
themselves. O

Big O
meals, B-TARGET
it's O
delicious. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
squid. B-TARGET

There's O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
choice O
of O
cocktails, B-TARGET
some O
very O
good O
ones. O

They O
especially O
liked O
orgasm B-TARGET
and O
strawberry B-TARGET
margarita. I-TARGET

In O
general, O
everyone O
was O
satisfied, O
I O
suggest! O

They O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
a O
Chinese O
restaurant O
near O
the O
house, O
and O
the O
closest O
one O
was O
Wife-Jean. O

At O
first O
glance, O
Chinese O
attributes O
were O
visible O
from O
the O
street. O

Inside O
the O
first O
floor, O
the O
dance O
floor, O
the O
European O
pops, O
we O
were O
asked O
to O
go O
to O
the O
second O
floor. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
be O
surprised O
by O
the O
Chinese B-TARGET
interior, I-TARGET
the O
bistro B-TARGET
sofas, I-TARGET
the O
tablecloths B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
a-la O
cafeteria O
table, O
the O
European O
lights/lights, O
in O
general, O
there's O
absolutely O
no O
Chinese O
interior! B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
uncomfortable. O

Well, O
since O
we O
couldn't O
go O
anywhere O
else, O
we O
decided O
to O
order O
some O
food. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
wasn't O
happy O
with O
the O
printed O
sheets, O
the O
composition B-TARGET
of O
the O
dishes O
and O
the O
weight, O
and O
the O
pictures O
weren't O
even O
spoken O
of. O

Okay, O
well, O
the O
Chinese O
kitchens O
are O
familiar-- O
they O
ordered O
beef, B-TARGET
pork, B-TARGET
rice, B-TARGET
a O
couple O
of O
snacks, B-TARGET
they're O
big, O
they're O
tasty, O
they're O
hotter. O

Of O
course, O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
tableware B-TARGET
could O
be O
better. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
didn't O
say O
hi O
about O
the O
service, O
didn't O
have O
time O
to O
sit O
down, O
came O
to O
order, O
the O
food O
was O
delivered O
quickly, O
but O
the O
bill O
had O
to O
wait... O
with O
only O
two O
tables O
to O
be O
occupied O
besides O
us. O

It O
was O
good O
to O
eat O
in O
general, O
but O
the O
second O
time O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
go, O
I O
love O
to O
have O
a O
Chinese O
anthurag O
in O
places O
like O
this. O

I O
just O
heard O
from O
someone O
I O
know O
about O
a O
restaurant O
called O
"Mamalyga." O

On O
Sunday O
evening, O
she O
decided O
to O
visit. O

We're O
going O
to O
a O
restaurant O
where O
we're O
met O
by O
a O
benevolent, O
beautiful O
girl. B-TARGET

She's O
walking O
to O
the O
table, O
indicating O
where O
you O
can O
keep O
the O
top O
clothes. O

There's O
no O
Garderob O
at O
the O
establishment, O
but O
there's O
some O
floor O
hangers. O
In O
a O
few O
minutes, O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
to O
us O
with O
a O
menu. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
interior! B-TARGET

A O
very O
unusual O
and O
interesting O
design B-TARGET
solution. I-TARGET

All O
the O
details O
are O
thought O
of O
in O
detail O
and O
together O
create O
a O
wonderful O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
warmth O
and O
comfort. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
good O
looking O
and O
easy O
to O
read, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
special O
sentence. O

Nicely O
surprised O
by O
the O
prices. O

The O
service's B-TARGET
fine. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
of O
the O
menu O
know, O
work O
well, O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
guests. O

They're O
smiling, O
which O
is O
always O
nice. O
In O
a O
word, O
serving B-TARGET
the O
10 O
balls O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
guests. O

They O
cook O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
but O
not O
critical. O

They're O
cooking O
really O
good, O
especially O
barbecues B-TARGET
and O
napoleon. B-TARGET
(Thanks O
to O
the O
big O
cooks) O

It's O
also O
a O
great O
Caucasian B-TARGET
bazaar. I-TARGET

I O
didn't O
stop O
until O
after O
I O
left, O
and O
I O
bought O
fruit O
(very O
tasty). O

Thanks O
to O
the O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
pleasant O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
we O
were O
very O
happy O
and O
had O
a O
wonderful O
evening! O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
lovely O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Now O
I'm O
gonna O
go O
to O
your O
place B-TARGET
a O
lot!!!! O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants. B-TARGET

Ever O
since O
the O
opening, O
I've O
been O
visiting O
him O
since O
I O
used O
to O
live O
near O
him. O

At O
the O
opening, O
20 O
percent O
of O
the O
discount O
card O
was O
given O
as O
a O
gift, O
and O
this O
was O
a O
motivation O
for O
frequent O
visits. O

Everything's O
always O
very O
good: O
smoke B-TARGET
borste, I-TARGET
grill B-TARGET
rolls, I-TARGET
great O
Philadelphia. B-TARGET

My O
young O
man O
was O
skeptical O
of O
my O
reviews O
until O
I O
took O
him O
there. O

They O
ate O
the O
Ribai, B-TARGET
and O
they O
concluded O
that O
it O
was O
better O
than O
in O
some O
steakhouses. O

Cesar's O
favorite O
shrimp B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
good, O
too. O

The O
lines B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
big, O
beautiful O
plates, B-TARGET
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
separate: O
there O
are O
waiters B-TARGET
who O
have O
been O
working O
since O
the O
opening-- O
that's O
also O
a O
good O
quality O
indicator. O

The O
chef's B-TARGET
been O
at O
the O
opening, O
too. O

Even O
business B-TARGET
lunch I-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

I O
can't O
say O
anything O
about O
desserts. O
I O
can't. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
pretty O
quiet, O
in O
beige O
brown O
tones, O
but O
not O
cheap, O
you're O
not O
gonna O
say O
it's O
some O
fucking O
coffee O
shop. O

And O
there's O
never O
been O
a O
disappointment O
in O
this O
place B-TARGET
all O
the O
time, O
not O
a O
lie! O

It's O
not O
an O
ad O
for O
this O
place B-TARGET
or O
any O
PR, O
because O
it O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
this O
place. O

I O
just O
wanted O
to O
say O
thank O
you! O

I O
want O
you O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
center O
or O
the O
center, O
because O
I'm O
already O
living O
in O
the O
center. O

Wish: O
Stay O
at O
the O
same O
level! O

Random O
review. O

Random O
because O
it O
was O
the O
only O
time. O

It O
wasn't O
a O
big O
company O
on O
February O
5, O
tonight. O

They'll O
meet O
you, O
they'll O
take O
you O
all O
the O
way. O

They O
smile, O
they O
offer O
to O
try O
everything O
on O
the O
menu. O

You've O
already O
eaten O
one O
dessert, O
so O
take O
another O
one. O

Good-willed O
to O
the O
limit. O

They O
tell O
you O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
dish, O
they O
advise O
you, O
in O
one O
word: O
nice O
communication. O

They O
bring O
in, O
bring O
in, O
service, O
don't O
stick, O
and O
it's O
almost O
full O
room. O

It's O
worth O
noting O
that O
we've O
been O
waiting O
a O
long O
time, O
but O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
serves O
us O
has O
smoothed O
all O
the O
corners. O

Well, O
that O
was O
a O
good O
night, O
thank O
you, O
Polente. B-TARGET

He O
recently O
visited O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
the O
advice O
of O
his O
friends. O

Interesting O
menu, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
price-quality O
ratio. O

I O
liked O
the O
soup B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
bread, O
I O
didn't O
try O
it O
anywhere, O
it's O
really O
weird O
and O
tasty. O

Nice O
interior, B-TARGET
smiling O
staff, B-TARGET
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Besides, O
there's O
a O
kid's B-TARGET
corner I-TARGET
in O
one O
of O
the O
halls! O

So O
it's O
a O
beautiful O
place B-TARGET
not O
only O
for O
those O
who O
just O
want O
to O
eat O
good O
and O
cheap, O
but O
also O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
whole O
family.) O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
yesterday, O
celebrating O
six O
months O
of O
married O
life. O

Heard O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
feedback O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service, O
the O
perfect O
kitchen. O

Actually, O
he O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
like O
a O
party. O

There O
have O
been O
many O
restaurants O
in O
St. O
Petersburg O
and O
elsewhere. O

The O
service B-TARGET
really O
wasn't O
bad O
news, O
but O
the O
food O
was O
really O
good. O
I O
like O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
terrible. O

Cesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
all O
over O
the O
plate O
is O
salad B-TARGET
leaves, I-TARGET
a O
little O
bacon B-TARGET
round O
and O
all O
in O
the O
sauce, B-TARGET
cheese B-TARGET
on O
top O
(cesar O
cooks O
with O
chicken). O

Then O
there O
were O
scallops B-TARGET
like O
nothing, O
but O
they O
gave O
away O
vinegar, B-TARGET
and O
the O
mashed O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
salted O
with O
it. O

The O
last O
meal O
was O
veal O
and O
it O
had O
potato O
cutlets, O
and O
veal B-TARGET
also O
gave O
vinegar O
in O
a O
potato B-TARGET
cutlet I-TARGET
to O
be O
hair O
or O
animal O
or O
human. O

The O
waiter O
was O
given O
this O
hair. O

We O
got O
the O
bill O
at O
10% O
off, B-TARGET
probably O
because O
of O
the O
hair. O

Anyway, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
very O
hungry, O
she O
ate O
a O
spoon O
of O
every O
meal. B-TARGET

My O
husband O
ordered O
snails B-TARGET
and O
beef, B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
all O
vinegar. O

They O
weren't O
happy. O

Unfortunately, O
you O
couldn't O
taste O
the O
famous O
oysters, B-TARGET
they're O
over. O

Freshly B-TARGET
squeezed I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
and O
bread B-TARGET
were O
delicious O
(such O
bread B-TARGET
has O
never O
been O
eaten) O

Anyway, O
they O
went, O
they O
looked, O
they O
ate... O

We're O
not O
going O
again. O

I O
haven't O
been O
in O
such O
a O
terrible O
place B-TARGET
in O
a O
long O
time. O

The O
service B-TARGET
just O
doesn't O
fit O
in, O
the O
officers B-TARGET
just O
don't O
pay O
any O
attention O
to O
you, O
and O
if O
they O
can O
catch O
anyone, O
they're O
looking O
at O
you O
with O
that O
look O
on O
your O
face. O
"Oh, O
you're O
gonna O
have O
to O
bring O
something." O

For O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
itself, O
no O
meal B-TARGET
was O
admiring. O

Due O
to O
the O
circumstances, O
I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
more O
than O
once, O
but O
I've O
been O
making O
sure O
every O
time O
I've O
had O
my O
first O
impression. O

One O
day, O
when O
ordering O
soup B-TARGET
from O
the O
waitress's O
menu, O
the O
waitress O
said O
that O
she O
should O
order O
another O
one O
because O
of O
this O
squid O
(!!!!). O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
very O
dark, O
not O
everyone's O
gonna O
like O
it O
either. O

Anyway, O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place. B-TARGET

There O
are O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
better-quality O
facilities O
on O
the O
same O
street. O

Hello!!! O

We O
went O
to O
Twins B-TARGET
with O
a O
friend O
yesterday, O
and O
everything O
was O
very O
good!! O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
(appears O
to O
be O
Eugene) O
was O
wonderful: O
he O
met, O
planted, O
immediately O
delivered O
the O
menu, O
asked O
if O
he O
could O
bring O
the O
drinks, O
then O
whether O
the O
food O
liked O
it, O
and O
he O
showed O
up O
all O
night O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
needed O
it!! O

I O
can't O
tell O
you O
what's O
wrong O
with O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
normal! O

We O
ordered O
two O
Maquis O
America, O
a O
chuck O
of O
salad O
and O
strawberry O
tea O
in O
a O
teapot. O

America B-TARGET
tastes O
good, O
but O
not O
enough O
fish, B-TARGET
chuckle B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
- O
good, O
tea B-TARGET
- O
didn't O
like O
it! O

We're O
happy O
tonight, O
so O
we O
can O
go O
in O
front O
of O
the O
club O
for O
some O
cocktails O
next O
time!) O

We O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
with O
our O
friends O
a O
few O
times! O

That's O
pretty O
good. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
nice, O
just O
fine! O

I O
love O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

The O
last O
time O
was O
January O
21st, O
they O
had O
a O
great O
time! O

There O
was O
a O
small O
company O
of O
five O
people. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
music B-TARGET
group, I-TARGET
the O
good O
music! B-TARGET

No O
claims O
servicing, B-TARGET
well O
met, O
had O
a O
table O
(booked O
in O
advance O
in O
the O
VIP O
zone, O
worth O
400 O
rubles). O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
didn't O
keep O
themselves O
waiting O
long, O
very O
polite O
and O
courteous! O

Pretty O
good O
place! B-TARGET

I've O
only O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
once, O
but O
I'd O
love O
to O
go O
again. O

Dinner O
with O
my O
sister O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O

Nice O
service, B-TARGET
everyone's O
been O
getting O
away O
with O
it O
quickly O
and O
politely. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
menu B-TARGET
choice, O
and O
for O
a O
long O
time O
I O
couldn't O
decide O
what O
to O
order O
because O
of O
the O
great O
variety B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

It O
was O
delicious, O
there's O
no O
comment O
in O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
our O
dinner, O
musicians O
arrived. O

I O
really O
liked O
their O
music. B-TARGET

It's O
beautiful, O
but O
it's O
not O
obsessive, O
so O
it's O
a O
great O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I'd O
love O
to O
go O
again O
more O
than O
once! O

Frost O
and O
sunshine O
are O
a O
wonderful O
day! O

I O
wanted O
to O
have O
lunch O
at O
a O
restaurant O
with O
a O
view O
of O
Finnish. O

Let's O
go O
to O
the O
sea! O

Well, O
we O
know O
about O
the O
100 O
r O
on O
the O
way O
in O
and O
the O
bad O
road... B-TARGET
it's O
tolerated. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
really O
liked O
it, O
there O
were O
lots O
of O
places: B-TARGET
nobody O
bothers, O
the O
big O
fish O
aquarium B-TARGET
smiled, O
the O
people O
almost O
didn't, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
nice. O

The O
windows B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
floor-- O
the O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
bay O
is O
magical!! O

Prices O
are O
the O
responsibility O
of O
this O
institution. B-TARGET

Coffee, B-TARGET
mint O
tea, B-TARGET
it's O
delicious. O

Cesars B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tuna I-TARGET
(very O
tasty O
tuna), B-TARGET
potato B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
(after O
which O
apparently O
was O
complimented O
with O
berries B-TARGET
sorbet) I-TARGET
and O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood I-TARGET
are O
delicious. O

I O
ordered O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
for O
dessert, I-TARGET
and O
I O
was O
very O
happy!!! O

I O
haven't O
eaten O
such O
good O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
in O
a O
while! O

They O
serve O
fast. O

I O
didn't O
notice O
the O
minutes. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
in, O
it O
was O
very O
nice O
to O
be O
surprised: O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
50 O
percent O
off O
is O
cheaper O
from O
13:00 O
to O
17:00 O
p.m., O
and O
we O
thought O
the O
waiters O
were O
wrong O
for O
us) O

The B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
basket I-TARGET
liked O
it, O
and O
by O
the O
way, O
it's O
free. O

Anyway, O
it's O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
romantic O
and O
a O
fun O
company O
there. O

We're O
waiting O
for O
the O
summer O
to O
come O
to O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

I've O
been O
in O
the O
pub B-TARGET
a O
couple O
of O
times, O
I O
really O
liked O
it. O

Tasty O
beer, B-TARGET
cheesesticks. B-TARGET

Good O
service. B-TARGET

Twice O
with O
my O
husband O
and O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

It O
was O
his O
birthday O
party. O

The O
husband's O
Spanish, O
and O
he's O
in O
love O
with O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
five-point O
score. O

For O
me, O
the O
minus O
was O
that O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
themselves O
were O
too O
specific. O

With O
the O
addition O
of O
berries B-TARGET
or O
fruit B-TARGET
and O
too O
many O
spices B-TARGET
in O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
it O
was O
unfortunately O
difficult O
for O
me O
personally O
to O
finish. O

My O
husband O
ate O
it. O

That's O
too O
bad. O

Because O
the O
meat, O
I O
mean O
the O
steak, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
it O
separately. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
never O
tried O
such O
a O
great O
steak B-TARGET
anywhere. O

Juicy, O
soft O
and O
cut O
like O
butter. O

European O
level O
of O
preparation. B-TARGET

Even O
though O
my O
husband O
prefers O
the O
meat B-TARGET
to O
the O
raw O
meat, O
as O
he O
was O
given O
it, O
and O
I'm O
good O
at O
it. O

When O
the O
husband O
came O
in O
for O
the O
second O
time, O
he O
was O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
it, O
weren't O
the O
cooks B-TARGET
changed? O

But O
when O
I O
found O
out O
the O
steak B-TARGET
was O
made O
as O
well, O
I O
was O
happy. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
tartar B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
raw O
fish O
and O
the O
raw O
egg. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
warning, O
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
beautiful. O

Well, O
it's O
a O
high-level O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
have O
been O
regular O
visitors O
to O
this O
institution B-TARGET
for O
over O
a O
year. O

The O
most O
important O
thing O
to O
note O
is O
the O
ever-high O
quality B-TARGET
of O
the O
kitchen. O

It's O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places B-TARGET
I O
want O
to O
try O
it O
all O
at O
once. O

Make O
sure O
to O
try O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls. B-TARGET

She's O
awesome, O
she O
cooks O
them O
fast, O
always O
fresh O
and O
very O
tasty! O

The O
amazing O
feature O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
network I-TARGET
is O
that O
in O
other O
restaurants O
(Comendant, O
Petrograd) O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
kitchen B-TARGET
levels O
remain O
at O
the O
same O
level. O

Especially O
if O
you O
are O
a O
regular O
visitor O
to O
Palok O
or O
Eurasia O
=)) O

The O
only O
thing O
I'd O
like O
to O
point O
out O
in O
the O
negative O
is O
that O
it's O
cold O
in O
the O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
when O
the O
front O
door O
opens, O
but O
it's O
nothing. O

If O
you're O
going O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
you're O
gonna O
have O
to O
try O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
carpentry, O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city. O

You O
don't O
have O
to O
do O
that O
one O
hot B-TARGET
time. O

Sometimes O
it's O
cold. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
sometimes O
it O
comes O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
sushi O
and O
soup O
and O
dessert. O

I O
hope O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
will O
be O
just O
as O
high O
as O
the O
favourite O
restaurant. B-TARGET

After O
a O
walk, O
they O
decided O
to O
go O
and O
eat O
with O
a O
friend, O
the O
last O
time O
in O
this O
restaurant O
was O
a O
long O
time O
ago, O
four O
years O
ago, O
I O
remember O
that O
the O
most O
delicious O
pizza B-TARGET
on O
a O
thin O
test O
I O
ate O
at O
Da O
Albertone, O
but O
since O
then O
I O
haven't O
been O
able O
to O
visit O
this O
Italian O
place, O
I'm O
really O
glad O
they O
still O
exist, O
and O
I've O
developed. O

Overall, O
the O
impressions O
are O
quite O
pleasant. O

At O
the O
entrance, O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
and O
a O
wardrobe B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
politely O
separated. O

The O
hall O
was O
picked O
by O
the O
Japanese-style O
one. O

Ordered O
pasta O
carbonar O
and O
roll O
of O
Philadelphia. O

And O
they O
decided O
to O
take O
Tiramisa O
for O
dessert, O
of O
course. O

Carbonara. B-TARGET

Beautiful, O
scented, O
smoking O
- O
this O
paste B-TARGET
so O
far O
is O
the O
best O
I've O
ever O
tasted!!!! O

Philadelphia B-TARGET
was O
only O
able O
to O
try, O
made O
a O
great, O
good O
piece O
of O
salmon-philatephia B-TARGET
rice, I-TARGET
bravely O
take O
Dessert B-TARGET
Tiramis I-TARGET
just O
melted O
in O
her O
mouth) O

It's O
a O
classic O
delicate O
cube. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
a O
warm, O
cozy O
and O
peaceful O
place. B-TARGET

The O
background O
music B-TARGET
didn't O
interfere O
with O
the O
conversation. O

The O
only O
less O
sense O
in O
the O
ladies' B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
that O
it O
doesn't O
clean O
very O
often. O

The O
urn B-TARGET
is O
full. O

So O
I'm O
writing O
a O
review O
of O
Dach's O
restaurant.)) O

It's O
a O
birthday O
party! O

A O
separate O
VIP O
room O
was O
ordered O
for O
14 O
people. O

Everyone O
had O
room, O
the O
table B-TARGET
was O
well O
served, O
and O
it O
was O
cozy O
and O
comfortable. O

The O
restaurant's O
interior, B-TARGET
I'm O
personally, O
I'm O
very O
impressed O
with O
my O
guests, O
too. O

As O
for O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
it's O
not O
bad, O
but O
I O
expected O
more. O

On O
the O
hot O
side, O
many O
ordered O
pork B-TARGET
and O
veal B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sage, I-TARGET
but O
both O
were O
dry O
and O
untasteful. O

And O
here's O
the O
fish B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
bacon. O

There's O
nothing O
to O
write O
about O
salads, B-TARGET
not O
really... O

Cold B-TARGET
snacks I-TARGET
are O
quite O
edible. O

There O
was O
a O
cake B-TARGET
that O
was O
separately O
ordered O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
cheesecake, O
and O
to O
my O
great O
regret, O
it O
wasn't O
much O
either.)) O

And O
for O
1,800 O
rubles, O
I O
think O
we O
could O
make O
it O
both O
better O
and O
sweeter O
and O
prettier. O

Here... O

And O
musical B-TARGET
escorts I-TARGET
are O
a O
separate O
story! O

Well, O
I O
didn't O
want O
their O
equipment B-TARGET
to O
work O
the O
way O
we O
wanted, O
and O
we O
couldn't O
listen O
to O
our O
CDs O
either. O

Anyway, O
it O
was O
a O
very O
dark O
evening!!! O

I O
wanted O
to O
dance, O
but O
alas... O

Well O
served, O
the O
girls B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice. O

Overall, O
there's O
not O
a O
bad O
impression O
left. O

Although O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
need O
to O
be O
adjusted, O
and O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
equipment O
are O
getting O
newer. O

I've O
been O
to O
Dacha B-TARGET
twice, O
and O
I O
think O
I'll O
come O
again O
if O
I O
can!!! O

The O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
interior, O
and O
the O
interior O
again!!!! O
a O
common O
color B-TARGET
decision I-TARGET
and O
every O
detail O
is O
adorable!!!!! O
especially O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
popular O
minimalism O
now, O
Dacha B-TARGET
is O
the O
most O
homely O
and O
beautiful O
place. O

I O
think O
it's O
perfect O
to O
meet O
my O
friends O
for O
tea O
with O
the O
cakes B-TARGET
- O
they're O
also O
great O
- O
and O
for O
a O
romantic O
date O
when O
you O
want O
to O
enjoy O
the O
environment B-TARGET
and O
socializing O
with O
the O
person O
you O
love, O
and O
for O
a O
little O
family O
celebration, O
it's O
also O
wonderful!!!! O

The O
service-- B-TARGET
since O
it's O
been O
two O
times, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
1-1................................... O

It O
didn't O
ruin O
the O
general O
impression, O
though. O

Always O
spotlessly O
clean, O
good O
instruments B-TARGET
and O
dishes, B-TARGET
nice O
tables, B-TARGET
clean O
windows, B-TARGET
all O
at O
the O
level. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
also O
enjoyed,-- O
great O
combinations, O
good O
meals, B-TARGET
and O
it's O
delicious. O
I'm O
a O
sweetie, O
so O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
an O
extra O
plus!) O

For O
me, O
also, O
the O
benefits O
of O
steel O
- O
a O
separate O
wardrobe, B-TARGET
a O
convenient O
zoning, B-TARGET
and O
certainly O
live O
petals B-TARGET
that O
can O
be O
fed O
with O
pink O
petals O
-)) O
thank O
you! O

He O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
September O
at O
the O
company O
of O
a O
lovely O
companion. O

The O
general O
impression O
was O
very O
positive: O
- O
Started O
with O
the O
reservation O
of O
a O
table O
over O
the O
telephone, O
the O
polite O
administrator B-TARGET
booked O
the O
table O
according O
to O
all O
my O
wishes;. O

When O
we O
arrived, O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
friendly O
girl, B-TARGET
who O
walked O
to O
our O
table O
and O
handed O
us O
the O
menu;. O

The O
table O
was O
at O
the O
window, O
with O
a O
soft O
couch: B-TARGET
very O
cozy O
and O
comfortable;. O

The O
order O
was O
made, O
all O
cooked O
very O
quickly: O
after O
20 O
minutes, O
everything O
was O
already O
on O
the O
table;. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
but O
separately O
I'd O
like O
to O
celebrate O
a O
beautiful O
meal; B-TARGET
;. O

After O
a O
hot O
one, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
recommended O
a O
tasty O
dessert B-TARGET
we O
couldn't O
give O
up. O

As O
a O
result, O
we O
spent O
about O
two O
hours O
in O
this O
place, B-TARGET
having O
a O
lovely O
dinner O
and O
socializing, O
cozy O
and O
romantic O
dressing! O

The O
average O
check O
per O
person O
was O
up O
to O
1,000 O
rubles. O

After O
dinner, O
we O
immediately O
decided O
that O
we'd O
be O
visiting O
this O
place B-TARGET
again O
soon. O

Alexei, O
xxx255 O

It's O
a O
very O
interesting O
place. B-TARGET

So O
let's O
just O
say O
it's O
a O
bar O
and O
a O
restaurant O
and O
a O
disco O
and O
karaoke, O
a O
celebration, O
watching O
football O
matches... O
all O
you O
can O
think O
of O
is O
Moon O
Night. O

It's O
kind O
of O
weird O
how O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
like O
this O
ended O
up O
near O
the O
outskirts O
of O
O.O. O

I O
came O
here O
at O
11:00 O
p.m., O
there's O
a O
wardrobe, B-TARGET
but O
for O
some O
reason O
no O
one's O
met O
me, O
it O
took O
me O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
wait. O

Then, O
a O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
came O
over, O
said O
hello, O
smiled, O
and O
apologized O
for O
waiting. O

There O
are O
several O
rooms. O

I O
was O
offered O
"living O
music" O
by O
karaoke O
in O
the O
performance O
of O
guests O
and O
"discotheque" O
music O
at O
a-la O
club O
three O
or O
four O
years O
ago. O

I O
picked O
a O
disco O
room-- O
it's B-TARGET
not O
loud-- O
if O
there's O
anything O
that O
can O
turn O
it O
down-- O
really O
liked O
the O
comfortable O
sofas B-TARGET
and O
the B-TARGET
table-- I-TARGET

The O
only O
minus, O
it's O
a O
little O
chilly O
'cause O
it O
blows O
from O
the O
door O
and O
windows. O

At O
11:00 O
p.m., O
there O
were O
two O
tables O
occupied. O

Cozy, O
you O
can't O
say O
anything! O

Kitchen... O

I O
ordered O
a O
pork O
barbecue. O

They O
brought O
it O
to O
the O
coals B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
potatoes...... I-TARGET
really, O
very O
tasty...and O
wine, B-TARGET
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
girl B-TARGET
couldn't O
really O
explain O
what O
kind O
of O
wine, O
only O
"well, O
it's O
good."..yes, O
the O
white B-TARGET
half-sweet I-TARGET
was O
very O
impressed) O

Low-cost, O
democratic O
prices O
(250 O
kebabs B-TARGET
+ O
150 O
wines) B-TARGET
for O
this O
quality O
have O
made O
me O
happy... O
to O
come O
here O
again... O
and O
not O
even O
once. O

I O
went O
there O
yesterday. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
unusual. O
It's O
attractive. O

And O
it O
was O
very O
cold O
in O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
itself, O
even O
though O
they O
had O
candy, O
they O
only O
turned O
it O
on O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
it, O
but O
it O
didn't O
save O
it, O
the O
hands O
were O
iced! O

The O
kitchen O
ordered O
pizza, B-TARGET
so... O
nothing O
special, O
you O
could O
eat, O
there O
was O
no O
doping, B-TARGET
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
add. O

I O
wanted O
to O
order O
some O
more O
dessert, O
so O
they O
didn't O
have O
any O
fruit B-TARGET
either. O

They O
ordered O
tea, B-TARGET
tasted O
like O
the O
cheapest. O

The B-TARGET
waiter's I-TARGET
been O
missing O
out O
all O
the O
time, O
even O
though O
the O
people O
weren't O
there. O

Another O
thing O
I O
didn't O
like O
is O
that O
the O
cooks O
go O
right O
through O
all O
the O
cafes, O
back O
and O
forth. O

Anyway, O
I'm O
not O
excited O
about O
this O
place, B-TARGET
I'm O
not O
going O
there O
anymore. O

I O
was O
there O
for O
the O
last O
time O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
at O
about O
four O
o'clock! O

The O
tables O
were O
almost O
all O
busy, O
ordered O
the O
soup, B-TARGET
didn't O
take O
long, O
and O
it O
was O
delicious, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
there O
wasn't O
when O
it O
wasn't O
complaining, O
always O
comes O
with O
a O
compliment O
from O
the O
chef, O
and O
as O
far O
as O
spaghetti B-TARGET
is O
concerned, O
you O
can O
order O
half O
a O
serving O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
eat! O

The O
restaurant O
itself O
isn't O
very O
big, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
nice, O
it's O
kind O
of O
cozy! O

But O
there's O
a O
huge O
minus, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
on O
the O
street O
of O
the O
rebellion, O
and O
unfortunately, O
there's O
no O
place O
to O
park, O
and O
it's O
very O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
place O
near O
at O
least, O
and O
that's O
what O
the O
evening O
is! O

On O
Sunday, O
a O
friend O
visited O
the O
establishment. O

They O
chose O
this O
restaurant O
because O
they O
live O
nearby... O

First O
I O
read O
the O
reviews O
-- O
they O
weren't O
very O
impressed, O
but O
I O
thought O
I'd O
check O
it O
out O
myself... O

We've B-TARGET
had I-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
fun! O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
all O
in O
beautiful O
shapes, O
very O
nice. O

Ordered O
and O
prepared O
to O
wait... O

They O
brought O
us O
beer O
in O
just O
a O
few O
minutes, O
and O
then O
they O
brought O
us O
salads. O

We O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
at O
this O
speed B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
service. I-TARGET
)) O

Salats B-TARGET
will O
lick O
your O
fingers!!! O

I O
took O
the O
smoked B-TARGET
eel I-TARGET
- O
SOPER!!!! O

They're B-TARGET
very O
nice. O

A O
friend O
ordered O
fish O
roulettes O
and O
brought O
roulettes B-TARGET
and O
salad!!! B-TARGET

Then O
they O
served O
the O
sorbet, B-TARGET
tasty O
too O
)) O

The O
hot O
one O
ordered O
a O
milk O
veal O
with O
a O
garnish... O

Meat B-TARGET
just O
melted O
in O
your O
mouth... O

Unfortunately, O
there O
wasn't O
enough O
room O
for O
dessert O
in O
the O
stomach. O

That's O
why O
I O
can't O
say O
anything O
here. O

I O
haven't O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
going O
to O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
long O
time! O

I O
liked O
the O
whole O
situation, O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
at O
the O
top! O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
gonna O
be O
one O
of O
my O
favorites))) O

Although O
there's O
one O
minus... O

No O
area B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
non-smokers. I-TARGET

But O
it O
didn't O
smell O
like O
smoke O
(we O
were O
from O
16:00 O
to O
18:00) O

Thank O
you! O

I O
just O
moved O
to O
Pushkin. O

There O
was O
absolutely O
no O
time O
to O
walk O
through O
the O
park, O
I'm O
not O
talking O
about O
any O
restaurants. O

I O
was O
lucky O
recently, O
and O
I O
took O
the O
time O
to O
go O
to O
Catherine O
Park. O

The O
weather O
was O
awful, O
decided O
to O
hide O
in O
some O
cozy O
cafe. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
first O
person O
to O
go O
to O
the O
meeting O
and O
wondered O
where O
there O
was O
a O
good O
place O
to O
have O
coffee. O

The O
man, O
no O
doubt, O
replied O
that O
there O
was O
a O
wonderful O
White-Rabbit B-TARGET
cafe I-TARGET
on O
the O
street O
of O
Moscow. O

When O
I O
got O
there, O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
very O
comfortable O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
and, O
of O
course, O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
I O
pay O
tribute O
to O
the O
masters O
and O
designer! B-TARGET

That O
day O
I O
drank O
Americano, B-TARGET
and O
I O
ate O
Philadelphia, B-TARGET
and O
I O
was O
happy, O
fresh O
food, B-TARGET
fragrant O
coffee! B-TARGET

A O
week O
later, O
she O
went O
out O
with O
a O
friend, O
ordered O
two O
steaks O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
red O
wine. O

You O
don't O
find O
steaks B-TARGET
like O
that O
in O
the O
shagb, O
they're O
delicious! O

It's O
really O
good! O

By O
the O
way, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
you O
can't O
see O
it, O
but O
the O
plates O
disappear O
immediately! O

I O
think O
I'm O
gonna O
go O
to O
Novello's O
Italian O
wine O
tonight. O

Thank O
you O
for O
this O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
in O
Pushkin! O

Good O
luck! O

It's O
a O
great O
place. B-TARGET
My O
husband O
and O
I O
love O
it. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
great, O
the O
kitchen's B-TARGET
delicious, O
but O
we're O
very O
happy, O
even O
ate, O
and O
my O
husband O
has O
marked O
the O
carpacho, B-TARGET
and O
I'm O
a O
three-chocolate B-TARGET
dessert! O

I O
especially O
wanted O
to O
stop O
at O
the O
service, B-TARGET
thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
waiter B-TARGET
Maxim, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
pleasure! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
institution O
has O
also O
been O
pleased, O
the O
good O
Italian B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
played, O
in O
the O
general O
highest O
rating O
of O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
wait O
for O
us, O
we'll O
be O
there.)) O

I O
went O
to O
this O
place O
today. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
normal, O
I'd O
say O
it O
was O
delicious. O

But O
there's O
one O
thing... O

While O
the O
restaurant O
was O
almost O
empty, O
I O
waited O
over O
40 O
minutes, O
plus O
one O
of O
the O
waitress's B-TARGET
desserts O
completely O
forgot O
and O
carried O
it O
for O
another O
20 O
minutes. O

And O
what O
was O
most O
surprising O
and O
displeased O
was O
that O
there O
were O
only O
ingridients O
on O
the O
dessert O
menu, O
and O
the O
real O
dish B-TARGET
was O
part O
of O
the O
ingridients O
I O
never O
found! O

So O
if O
anyone's O
out O
there O
for O
lunch O
or O
dinner, O
you're O
gonna O
have O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
you O
can O
wait O
a O
very O
long O
time O
to O
order! O

And O
we O
went O
there O
with O
our O
husband O
at O
lunch, O
full O
of O
places, O
served O
quickly. O

A O
very O
nice O
waitress, B-TARGET
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
a O
small O
place, B-TARGET
but O
still O
nice. O

The O
order O
was O
waiting O
for O
15 O
minutes, O
bringing O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
sushi, B-TARGET
very O
tasty. O

They're O
up O
to O
5:00 O
p.m. O
on O
a O
50% O
discount O
on O
them... O
so O
we O
ordered... O

My O
husband O
was O
quick, O
and O
I O
ordered O
more O
rolls, B-TARGET
but, O
unfortunately, O
it's O
not O
so O
good O
anymore... O
I O
don't O
remember O
the O
elaborate O
name, O
but O
it O
was O
green O
onions O
and O
black O
peppers... O
tasty, O
dry... O
and O
so O
good. O

Of O
all O
Japan's B-TARGET
kitchens, I-TARGET
it's O
the O
best, O
we'll O
be O
there O
again O
before O
November O
20th... O
on O
stock!!!!! O

The O
toilet B-TARGET
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
sofa O

) O

) O

) O

Don't O
judge O
a O
man O
by O
his O
clothes... O
May O
9th... O

Pasturous O
but O
warm O
Peter's O
evening... O

At O
the O
company, O
the O
friends O
decided O
to O
go O
downtown O
for O
a O
bite O
at O
Tefsi O
because O
they O
were O
there O
and O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
things. O

We O
were O
surprised O
to O
see O
us O
at O
the O
entrance, O
as O
we O
looked O
like O
teenagers, O
but O
as O
we O
say O
at O
the O
company O
"we O
can O
afford"). O

I'm O
not O
gonna O
talk O
about O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
'cause O
it's O
probably O
all O
written O
in O
earlier O
reviews, O
so O
I O
might O
say O
one O
thing O
I O
like, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
also O
made O
us O
happy-- O
the O
hachapuri B-TARGET
are O
great, O
the O
hinkals B-TARGET
are O
big, O
but O
the O
meat's B-TARGET
a O
little O
dry, O
the O
eggplants B-TARGET
are O
baked, O
the B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
there's O
not O
enough O
sauce, B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
hasn't O
offered O
to O
order O
it O
any O
more. O

And O
that's O
the O
end O
of O
all O
the O
good O
things, O
because O
the O
service B-TARGET
in O
this O
place O
is O
zero, O
the O
dishes O
weren't O
delivered O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
so O
I O
ate O
when O
all O
my O
other O
dishes O
were O
already O
eaten, O
the O
dishes O
weren't O
cleaned O
off O
the O
table, O
but O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is, O
when O
the O
change O
check O
came, O
all O
the O
good O
impressions O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
disappeared, O
naturally O
no O
one O
else O
came O
to O
us, O
and O
when O
we O
left, O
no O
one O
said O
goodbye O
to O
us. O

I O
didn't O
leave O
the O
tips, O
because O
I O
think O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
this O
place B-TARGET
has O
already O
earned O
their O
money O
on O
tea. O

On O
July O
31, O
we O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
at O
Andante's O
restaurant. O

The O
choice O
of O
the O
restaurant O
came O
up O
well, O
there O
were O
many O
different O
offers, O
but O
nothing O
better O
than O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Everything's O
fine O
from O
the O
first O
call O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
communication O
with O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
to O
our O
gathering O
after O
the O
party. O

Always O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
at O
any O
time, O
in O
personal O
contact O
and O
on O
the O
phone. O

There O
are O
several O
menu B-TARGET
options O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
on O
any O
wallet, O
on O
each O
menu, O
a O
lot O
of O
choices, O
hot B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cold I-TARGET
snacks, I-TARGET
hot B-TARGET
drinks. B-TARGET

My O

It O

the O
first O
time O
today! O

It O
was O
very O
nice. O

And O
there O
was O
room O
on O
the O
couch, O
and O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
nice, O
but O
non-addictive, O
nice, O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
relaxes, O
and O
you O
can O
have O
a O
conversation O
under O
her. O

Operation O
service, B-TARGET
wait O
1-2 O
minutes O
for O
beer, O
toast O
a O
little O
longer, O
beer's B-TARGET
great!!!! O
I O
love O
it!!! O

The O
atmosphere O
is O
very O
cozy, O
and O
it's O
also O
good O
to O
see O
that O
there's O
such O
a O
beautiful O
place B-TARGET
near O
the O
house!!! O

Yesterday, O
my O
mother's O
birthday O
was O
celebrated O
by O
a O
company O
of O
six. O

The O
table O
was O
booked O
the O
day O
before, O
and O
we O
agreed O
that O
by O
the O
time O
we O
arrived, O
the O
snacks O
would O
be O
ready. O

They O
came O
a O
little O
early, O
but O
they O
were O
waiting O
for O
us. O

We O
liked O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
so O
much O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
tase O
everything O
we O
could O
and O
order O
them O
in O
some O
wild O
quantities, O
so O
unfortunately O
there O
was O
no O
room O
for O
the O
hot O
stuff O
(I O
went O
after O
the O
beef, O
but O
it O
didn't O
work, O
so O
we'll O
come O
back). O

They O
ordered O
a O
sorba O
for O
dessert, O
and O
it's O
a O
ritual. O

And O
it O
tastes O
great, O
we O
had O
strawberries B-TARGET
and O
mangoes. B-TARGET

All O
in O
all, O
we're O
very O
happy, O
and O
we're O
gonna O
come O
over O
again, O
and O
this O
time O
we're O
gonna O
leave O
a O
place O
for O
meat O
=) O

A O
calm O
and O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
a O
careful O
but O
non-addictive O
service, B-TARGET
excellent O
food B-TARGET
- O
all O
on O
hard O
10! O

Marina O
and O
Katya, O
thank O
you O
for O
a O
great O
evening, O
and O
we O
hope O
to O
see O
you O
again O
:-) O

We O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
this O
birthday O
with O
my O
family, O
my O
wife O
and O
my O
brother. O

In O
a O
couple O
of O
days, O
he O
booked O
a O
table, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
good O
thing, O
despite O
the O
day O
before, O
the O
veranda O
was O
full-time. O

At O
the O
entrance, O
the O
smiley O
hostess B-TARGET
met O
and O
walked O
to O
the O
table O
nicely. O

The O
young O
man O
Anton O
served. O

In O
the O
course, O
there O
was O
a O
little O
panic O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
everything.)) O

They O
chose O
sacivi B-TARGET
(cold O
tasted O
for O
the O
first O
time-- O
amazing, O
very O
thin O
taste), O
hachapuri B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
megrel I-TARGET
(more O
than O
cheese O
pizza))), O
dishes O
on O
mangal, O
and O
the O
boys O
took O
all O
kinds O
of O
snacks O
and O
salads, O
I O
just O
don't O
remember O
which O
ones. O

For O
dessert, O
my O
wife O
took O
a O
classic O
Napoleon, B-TARGET
tried O
it O
and O
sentenced O
it O
as O
a O
child, O
tasty).) O

I O
decided O
to O
try O
the O
lamb O
testicles-- O
not O
impressed O
because O
they O
were O
frozen, O
taste O
completely O
different, O
shouldn't O
they O
be. O

And O
everything O
else, O
the O
chef's B-TARGET
great. O

Waiter B-TARGET
Anton O
worked O
clearly, O
without O
significant O
delay, O
and O
without O
rushing O
anywhere. O

It's O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
good O
kitchen B-TARGET
without O
bad O
service. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
homemade O
and O
very O
cozy, O
the O
toilet B-TARGET
is O
great O
at O
all, O
and O
the O
fairy O
tales O
playing O
there O
are O
relaxing.)) O

As O
a O
result, O
because O
of O
the O
abundance O
of O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
we O
could O
barely O
get O
up O
from O
behind O
the O
table, O
we O
could O
be O
satisfied, O
we O
could O
get O
a O
little O
bit O
drunk.)) O

Thank O
you O
so O
much. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I've O
been O
to O
a O
Wave O
restaurant. O

A O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
came O
and O
offered O
tables O
to O
choose! O

I O
decided O
to O
drink O
wine O
and O
asked O
the O
waitress O
what O
kind O
of O
wine O
you'd O
advise O
me, O
obviously O
the B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
don't O
teach O
me O
anything O
about O
wine O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
she O
couldn't O
explain O
it O
to O
me! O

I O
picked O
out O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
myself, O
I O
thought O
I'd O
try O
a O
handmade O
salad O
with O
baked O
potatoes O
and O
asparagus O
scissors! O

I O
was O
surprised O
to O
hear O
a O
compliment O
from O
the O
chef O
in O
front O
of O
the O
salad, O
although O
my O
enthusiasm O
wasn't O
long, O
my O
salad O
was O
carrying O
me O
40 O
minutes O
or O
more, O
salad B-TARGET
was O
four, O
and O
then O
I O
waited O
for O
the O
scallops O
for O
another O
30 O
minutes, O
and O
I O
didn't O
even O
order O
dessert! O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
but O
nothing O
more O
than O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
is O
very O
hot! O

Nice O
pub!!!!!!!!!!!!!! B-TARGET

I O
thought O
I'd O
surprise O
my O
husband, O
and O
he O
did O
it! O

Nice O
interior! B-TARGET

A O
very O
tasty O
beer B-TARGET
and O
a O
lot O
of O
his O
choice, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
also O
great, O
all O
the O
meals B-TARGET
ordered O
were O
delicious, O
and O
the O
main O
reason O
why O
I O
picked O
this O
pub O
was O
because O
that O
day O
there O
was O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
nicely O
surprised, O
it O
was O
a O
great O
concert! B-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
is O
great, O
and O
we're O
going O
to O
visit O
it O
again!!! O

For O
me, O
the O
answer O
to O
the O
question, O
"Is O
it O
worth O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant?" B-TARGET
is O
one O
thing. O

Yes, O
of O
course O
it O
is! O

Many O
reasons O
for O
this: O
One O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
is O
a O
good O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Then O
there's O
the O
attention O
staff, B-TARGET
adequate O
prices, O
nice O
and O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
downtown. O

I O
like O
the O
place O
where O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is. O

The O
public B-TARGET
that O
comes, O
I O
like O
it, O
too. O

Good O
energy O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
created O
by O
thoughtful O
and O
professional O
people. B-TARGET

Too O
bad O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
don't O
know O
this O
great O
restaurant. B-TARGET

You O
feel O
very O
good O
here O
at O
any O
time O
and O
in O
any O
room, B-TARGET
be O
a O
big O
party O
(e.g. O
a O
feast) O
or O
if O
you O
accidentally O
come O
in O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee. O

You're O
always O
welcome O
here, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
at O
home O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

There O
aren't O
many O
good O
and O
cozy O
places B-TARGET
in O
Peter. O

I O
think O
the O
guest O
who O
will O
visit O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
will O
be O
his O
regular O
guest. O

I O
wish O
Rubinstein B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
of O
prosperity O
and O
success! O

With O
respect O
to O
Irina, O

We O
went O
to O
this O
place. O

Actually, O
they O
didn't O
get O
much O
negative O
impressions. O

A O
small O
choice O
of O
pizza B-TARGET
appeared O
odd, O
given O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Italian O
restaurant. O

And O
the O
taste O
of O
pizza B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

In O
general, O
it's O
not O
disgusting, O
but O
we O
ate O
better. O

Much O
better O
is O
the O
case O
with O
sushi. B-TARGET

Of O
course, O
prices O
aren't O
small, O
they O
match O
the O
name O
"RESTORAN." B-TARGET

Staff B-TARGET
have O
a O
lot O
of O
growth, O
but O
they're O
also O
on O
average. O

Girls B-TARGET
go O
face-to-face O
like O
visitors O
owe O
them O
something. O

From O
waitresses B-TARGET
to O
administrators. B-TARGET

If O
administrators B-TARGET
aren't O
perplexing O
themselves O
with O
a O
smile O
at O
clients, O
then O
what O
to O
expect O
from O
junior B-TARGET
staff? I-TARGET

Only O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
was O
happy, O
smiling O
all O
the O
time, O
and O
even O
though O
he O
wasn't O
serving O
our O
table, O
he O
didn't O
count O
the O
work O
and O
clean O
the O
dishes O
by O
passing O
us. O

It's O
been O
a O
long O
time, O
no, O
a O
long O
time O
to O
cook O
and O
carry O
sushi, O
since O
the O
order, O
it's O
probably O
been O
40-50 O
minutes... O

The O
fact O
that O
we O
didn't O
have O
a O
lunch O
order O
at O
3.50 O
p.m., O
even O
though O
it's O
on O
the O
menu O
until O
4:00 O
p.m.... O

Anyway, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
quiet, O
quiet O
place, O
have O
a O
drink O
and O
have O
a O
chat O
with O
your O
friends, O
Rosario B-TARGET
would O
be O
fine. O

If O
your O
aim O
is O
to O
eat O
a O
tasty O
and O
cheap O
pizza, B-TARGET
it's O
better O
not O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place. O

We O
had O
a O
birthday O
party, O
we O
enjoyed O
it, O
we O
managed O
to O
find O
a O
place B-TARGET
that O
would O
combine O
a O
cozy O
interior B-TARGET
(the O
first B-TARGET
room), I-TARGET
a O
delicious O
meal, B-TARGET
a O
pleasant O
staff, B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
democratic O
price O
(the O
33% O
discount O
for O
the O
birthday), O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
very O
strange O
moments. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
closes O
at O
half O
past O
12, O
so O
at O
some O
point O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
politely O
told O
us O
it O
wasn't O
very O
upsetting O
to O
us, O
we O
went O
to O
dance, O
but O
still... O
in O
a O
city O
where O
every O
place O
works O
up O
to O
the O
last O
client, O
it's O
a O
little O
weird O
2. O

They O
took O
the O
white O
Sicilian O
wine, B-TARGET
they O
liked O
it, O
they O
asked O
for O
the O
same O
wine, O
he O
was O
gone, O
they O
took O
another O
one, O
and O
it O
was O
in O
the O
same O
copy, O
and O
they O
took O
the O
third... O
3. O

The O
bill. O
As O
I've O
already O
pointed O
out, O
the O
prices O
are O
so O
democratic O
that O
when O
the O
bill O
came O
to O
me, O
I O
was O
very O
surprised O
at O
the O
company O
of O
7 O
people, O
(all O
ordered O
hot O
plus O
4 O
bottles O
of O
wine, O
salads) O

The O
bill O
was O
just O
under O
6 O
p.m., O
but O
when O
they O
brought O
me O
this O
very O
account O
with O
a O
pencil, O
it O
wrote O
10 O
per O
cent O
of O
the O
service O
and O
added O
about O
700 O
p. O

And O
the O
sum O
already O
was O
finished O
with O
a O
pencil, O
so O
I O
gave O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
a O
bank O
card O
that O
she O
asked O
me O
to O
pay O
for O
on O
the O
check O
with O
a O
card O
and O
a O
cash O
service. O

Of O
course O
we O
have O
no O
problem O
paying O
for O
the O
cash, O
but O
it's O
a O
direct O
tip O
extortion, O
and O
we'd O
have O
left O
them O
behind! O

Good O
afternoon! O

I O
want O
to O
share O
my O
impressions O
about O
my O
daughter O
Alexandra's O
wedding, O
which O
was O
held O
in O
your O
restaurant O
on O
August O
11, O
2012. O

You O
know, O
if O
I O
told O
you O
I O
liked O
everything, O
I O
might O
not O
believe O
it. O

But O
that's O
actually O
the O
way O
it O
is. O

And O
a O
wonderful O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
a O
beautiful O
table B-TARGET
set, I-TARGET
and O
an O
amazing O
kitchen, B-TARGET
and O
a O
fine O
design! B-TARGET

And O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
the O
people B-TARGET
who O
work O
here O
and O
we've O
been O
talking O
to O
about O
organizing O
a O
wedding O
party. O

This O
is O
first O
of O
all O
Alexander's O
administrator. B-TARGET

Very O
polite, O
kind, O
well-versed. O

All O
our O
wishes O
were O
taken O
into O
account O
by O
him. O

I'd O
also O
like O
to O
mention O
the O
girl B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
who O
was O
working O
on O
our O
party. O
(Unfortunately, O
I O
don't O
know O
her O
name.) O

Clever! O

Indistinctly, O
the O
dishes O
were O
cleaned, O
and O
new O
dishes O
and O
drinks O
appeared. O

And O
all O
of O
this O
was O
accompanied O
by O
her O
friendly O
smile. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
your O
work O
and O
so O
warm B-TARGET
to O
us, O
to O
your O
clients. O

All O
our O
guests O
associate O
themselves O
with O
my O
words O
and O
also O
express O
their O
gratitude O
to O
you O
for O
this O
evening. O

And O
our O
newlyweds O
are O
just O
excited O
about O
the O
party O
we've O
all O
had O
together O
for O
them. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much! O

Success O
in O
your O
pleasant O
work! O

And O
more O
grateful O
visitors O
to O
you! O

With O
respect, O
Tatiana. O

I O
often O
visit O
the O
Moscow O
area O
in O
the O
form O
of O
my O
activities O
and O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
for O
lunch O
several O
times. O

In O
the O
afternoon, O
it's O
crowded O
and O
attracts O
a O
20 O
percent O
discount B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
all I-TARGET
the O
dishes O
until O
16:00. O

Garderob B-TARGET
really O
didn't O
work, O
but O
it O
didn't O
bother O
us, O
there's O
plenty O
of O
places O
to O
put O
our O
clothes. O

Always O
picking O
the O
second B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
we O
feel O
comfortable O
there. O

East-style O
interior, B-TARGET
muffled O
lighting, B-TARGET
small O
background O
music, B-TARGET
no O
interference O
with O
conversation. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
about O
all O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
and O
the O
range B-TARGET
is O
big O
enough, O
but O
what O
we O
choose-- O
I O
like. O

Since O
the O
restaurant's O
east, O
we're O
picking O
out O
the O
food O
from O
the O
east. O

All O
the O
barbecues, B-TARGET
and O
we O
ordered O
them O
from O
veal B-TARGET
and O
beef B-TARGET
and O
pork, B-TARGET
were O
excellent. O

A O
lot O
likes O
the O
paste B-TARGET
- O
meat, O
beef, O
veal O
for O
choice, O
mushrooms, O
and O
vegetables O
- O
in O
a O
large O
metal O
plate O
on O
coals. O

Very O
tasty O
East O
tea B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
fig I-TARGET
jam, I-TARGET
it's O
really O
expensive O
enough. O

The O
service B-TARGET
all O
three O
times O
we O
were O
there O
was O
also O
impeccable. O

Courtesy, O
friendly O
waiters, B-TARGET
always O
ready O
to O
give O
you O
a O
tip O
and O
a O
tip. O

On O
my O
recommendation, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
visited O
by O
several O
of O
my O
friends O
and O
was O
also O
satisfied. O

A O
very O
good O
price/quality O
ratio. O

Good O
afternoon! O

A O
young O
man O
and O
I O
like O
to O
open O
new O
places... O
different O
restaurants... O
especially O
Italian. O

We've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
them. O

Found O
a O
restaurant, O
came O
in, O
all O
the O
guests O
sat O
on O
the O
terrace O
(summer O
after O
all), O
and O
we O
sat O
inside O
(near O
the O
conditioner). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy. O

Sitting O
right O
in O
front O
of O
the O
kitchen O
(where O
pizza O
is O
cooked) O
near O
the O
window. O

There's O
feedback O
that O
smells O
like O
kitchens... O
but O
I O
didn't O
really O
notice... O
and O
a O
slight O
smell O
of O
pizza O
I O
think O
only O
an O
appetite O
will O
add. O

I've O
heard O
reports O
that O
good O
pizza B-TARGET
is O
what O
they O
took, O
and O
they're O
very O
happy! O

In O
all O
Italian O
restaurants, O
I O
take O
a O
tyramis, O
a O
breadball, O
and... O
I O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom. O

That's O
how O
I O
rate O
the O
establishment. O

The O
bread O
should O
be O
fresh, O
the O
tyrama O
should O
be O
melted O
in O
the O
mouth, O
and O
the O
toilets O
should O
not O
be O
saved!! O

It's O
lovely, O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
magical! O

We O
had O
a O
nice O
time, O
saw O
Spare O
on O
the O
blood... O
romance. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
is O
very O
polite. O

The O
drinks O
came O
quickly... O
and O
the O
food O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
at O
all! O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
treat. B-TARGET

We'll O
make O
sure O
to O
come O
again! O

My O
friends O
recommended O
"City," O
so O
I O
decided, O
by O
the O
way, O
to O
have O
lunch O
there. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
light, O
stylish. O

The O
only O
minus O
is O
that O
the O
tables B-TARGET
(right O
of O
the O
entrance) O
are O
very O
close O
to O
each O
other, O
and O
if O
the O
table O
next O
to O
me O
was O
busy, O
I O
wouldn't O
be O
so O
comfortable O
anymore. O

I O
was O
immediately O
spotted O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
escorted O
to O
a O
table. O

They O
served O
with O
a O
quick O
smile O
and O
a O
smile! O

I O
ordered O
borscht, O
pasta, O
homemade O
chocolate O
and O
tea. O

I'm O
sorry O
for O
ordering O
my O
favorite O
borch! B-TARGET
It's O
not O
good O
here: O
cabbage B-TARGET
broth... I-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cabbage! B-TARGET
I O
tried O
to O
add O
more O
soda. O
) O
) O
) O
but O
it O
didn't O
help... O
unfortunately. O

Pasta B-TARGET
- I-TARGET
carbonara I-TARGET
was O
worthy!!! O

And O
from O
dessert, B-TARGET
I O
love O
it!! O

The O
general O
impressions O
are O
positive, O
even O
though O
the O
borscht B-TARGET
is O
)) O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
15% O
discount O
at O
lunchtime. B-TARGET

According O
to O
"City" O
reports, O
there O
are O
two O
different O
places O
in O
the O
afternoon O
and O
evening. O

I'm O
planning O
on O
stopping O
by O
sometime O
tonight O
with O
my O
husband. O

It O
wasn't O
the O
first O
time O
they O
were O
a O
company O
of O
four O
today, O
but O
it's O
only O
today O
that O
I'm O
gonna O
leave O
a O
review. O

In O
order: O
Kitchen B-TARGET
- O
Soup B-TARGET
Harcho, I-TARGET
barbecue B-TARGET
(trying O
almost O
all O
of O
them) O
5+ O
grade, O
puffs, B-TARGET
very O
good O
wine B-TARGET
(in O
my O
taste), O
and O
of O
course O
tea B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crab I-TARGET
:), O
that's O
why O
you O
should O
and O
should O
go, O
agree O
that O
in O
a O
place O
like O
this, O
some O
Greek O
salad O
is O
completely O
useless, O
and O
it O
shouldn't O
be O
good O
here O
:) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
- O
In O
general, O
it's O
quite O
topical, O
except O
for O
the O
column B-TARGET
already O
mentioned O
by O
someone O
in O
the O
room O
and O
maybe O
there's O
a O
lack O
of O
light B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
main O
room, O
I, O
like O
many O
people O
who O
have O
written O
here O
more O
like O
the O
light B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
it's O
much O
more O
cozy, O
the O
only O
thing O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
is O
the O
purity B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tablecloths, I-TARGET
not O
always O
perfect. O

Service B-TARGET
- O
Nice, O
polite O
young B-TARGET
people, I-TARGET
not O
too O
often, O
but O
not O
rarely O
suited, O
not O
heartless, O
smiled, O
and O
looked O
organic O
at O
all, O
no O
criticism. O

It's O
actually O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
sit, O
both O
business O
and O
private, O
for O
pontoons O
and O
dogs, O
not O
here, O
but O
it's O
still O
not O
up O
to O
the O
level O
of O
attracting O
these O
characters, O
but O
thank O
God. O

With O
everything O
written, O
the O
price O
is O
very O
adequate, O
at O
least O
that O
part O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
that O
we're O
interested O
in. O

Thank O
you O
for O
your O
attention. O

Beautiful O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Cozy O
environment B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
beautiful O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
bay. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
polite, O
all O
the O
wishes O
were O
met. O

Delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
meals B-TARGET
were O
normal, O
cooked O
and O
delivered O
quite O
quickly. O

In O
general, O
there O
are O
very O
good O
and O
pleasant O
impressions O
of O
the O
visit, O
and O
we O
will O
come O
again O
and O
again. O

Thank O
you! O

Hope O
C. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
very O
nice. O
It's O
been O
there O
many O
times! O

It's O
really O
good, O
and O
it's O
really O
big. O

I've O
had O
enough O
salad, B-TARGET
but O
I've O
had O
enough O
soup. O

Alena's O
particularly O
good O
waitress, B-TARGET
sweet, O
kind, O
kind O
and O
always O
helpful O
in O
her O
choices! O

The O
cooks B-TARGET
are O
great O
at O
hurrah. O

I O
especially O
liked O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
barbecue I-TARGET
and O
the O
Rosana B-TARGET
salad. I-TARGET
I O
suggest O
you O
all O
try O
it. O

In O
fact, O
at O
12 O
only O
the O
kitchen O
closes, O
and O
the O
bar B-TARGET
works O
until O
the O
last O
customer! O

I O
suggest O
you O
all O
go O
there. O

We O
met O
our O
friends O
for O
a O
beer. O

The O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance, O
we O
were O
met, O
we O
were O
escorted, O
the O
menu O
was O
brought O
in O
quickly. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
small, O
very O
private, O
which O
is O
nice. O

The O
interior, B-TARGET
like O
in O
other O
pubs, O
was O
happy O
with B-TARGET
books I-TARGET
and O
soft O
couchs. B-TARGET
:) O

The O
beer B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
there's O
a O
lot O
to O
choose O
from. O

The O
order O
was: O
weld B-TARGET
shrimps I-TARGET
are O
shrimps O
like O
shrimp, O
but O
some O
are O
too O
small O
(240 O
rubies), O
salmon B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
not O
bad, O
but O
fresh O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
clearly O
missing, O
squid B-TARGET
rings I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
platter O
are O
normal, O
beef B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
chips I-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
Ragu B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
but O
more O
like O
meat O
broth, O
royal B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
a O
very O
tasty O
dish O
(599 O
rubs.) O
I'm O
sorry O
to O
remember O
the O
price. O

There O
was O
one O
waitress B-TARGET
for O
the O
whole O
room O
(on O
Friday O
night O
all O
the O
tables O
are O
busy), O
but O
there O
wasn't O
much O
time O
for O
drinks O
and O
meals, O
there O
wasn't O
much O
niceness, O
and O
it O
wasn't O
bad. O

Our O
account O
for O
five O
people O
was O
about O
4,000 O
rubles. O

To O
sum O
up, O
you've O
had O
a O
good O
time, O
nice O
establishment. B-TARGET

The O
Atlantis B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
has O
remained O
one O
of O
the O
most O
pleasant O
and O
cozy O
places O
for O
many O
years. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
it's O
nice O
to O
be O
on O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
in O
the O
summer. O

The O
food's B-TARGET
gorgeous! O

Desserts B-TARGET
are O
a O
distinctly O
tasty O
topic:) O

Blanmange B-TARGET
and O
Dekuaz B-TARGET
are O
my O
favourites, O
I O
highly O
recommend! O

Sushi, B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
love, O
it's O
just O
super O
tasty, O
probably O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city, O
and O
beyond, O
in O
my O
opinion! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
always O
polite, O
and O
when O
we O
celebrated O
more O
than O
one O
holiday O
(at O
different O
times O
between O
10 O
and O
50 O
guests) O
everything O
was O
at O
the O
highest O
level, O
and O
the O
organization, B-TARGET
and O
the O
discussion B-TARGET
of O
the O
menu, O
and O
the O
serving B-TARGET
of O
the O
meal. O

Responsives O
are O
like O
in O
eternal O
history O
that O
a O
glass O
is O
half O
full O
or O
empty O
- O
all O
depends O
on O
what O
a O
person O
wants O
to O
find O
and O
see O
in O
a O
particular O
place. O

Either O
you O
look O
for O
dust O
on O
the O
shelves O
and O
notice O
other O
small O
things, O
or O
you O
enjoy O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
and O
everything O
around O
you. O

If O
you've O
decided O
to O
spend O
a O
wonderful O
day O
or O
evening O
at O
a O
pleasant O
company O
in O
a O
cozy O
place O
with O
good O
food, B-TARGET
Atlantis's B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
will O
help O
you. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
and O
thank O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
its O
quality O
work O
over O
the O
years! O

Good O
evening! O

I O
had O
dinner O
at O
this O
great O
restaurant B-TARGET
tonight. O

I O
personally O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
something O
like O
the O
Russian O
Kitch O
restaurant. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
magical. O

I O
totally O
agree O
with O
NAVEX O
that O
the O
soup B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
cooked O
garlic O
is O
something O
wonderful. O

As O
we've O
been O
told, O
they O
don't O
serve O
this O
in O
town O
anywhere O
else, O
it's O
their O
chef's B-TARGET
specialty. I-TARGET

They O
also O
tasted O
white B-TARGET
mushroom I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
(beautiful) O
and O
shrimp B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
(very O
tasty). O

I'd O
like O
to O
make O
a O
special O
mention O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

Special O
thanks O
to O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
Maria. O

I O
recommend O
we O
all O
go O
and O
evaluate O
ourselves. O

Very O
spacious O
and O
light, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
my O
favorite O
style:) O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
big, O
and O
the O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window O
is O
good. O

We O
were O
in O
the O
afternoon O
(the O
husband's O
office O
at O
BC O
Avenue), O
came O
in O
for O
coffee, O
didn't O
want O
to O
eat, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
appreciate O
the O
kitchen O
some O
other O
time. O

I O
only O
ate O
pumpkin B-TARGET
soup. I-TARGET

I O
hope O
next O
time O
I O
try O
beer, B-TARGET
they O
say O
it's O
good. O

There's O
no O
problem O
with O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
we've O
been O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
there's O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
the O
room, O
so O
I O
don't O
know O
what's O
going O
on O
in O
the O
evening O
hours O
with O
the O
service. O

We O
were O
quickly O
served:) O

We'll O
make O
sure O
to O
come O
again! O

Recently, O
they O
decided O
to O
visit O
the O
institution B-TARGET
with O
their O
family O
and O
friends, O
and O
they O
were O
very O
pleased O
to O
be O
surprised. O

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
there O
was O
no O
room O
available, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
fussed, O
but O
it O
didn't O
affect O
the O
speed O
and O
attention O
of O
the O
service. O

It O
felt O
like O
the O
staff B-TARGET
here O
cared O
about O
the O
mood O
and O
the O
impression O
of O
the O
visitors. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
happy, O
and O
classical O
Italian B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
were O
surprisingly O
tasty O
and O
highly O
authentic. O

Everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
generous O
enough. O

After O
reading O
the O
reviews O
here, O
he O
concluded O
that O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
was O
working O
on O
mistakes, O
and O
that O
the O
carpachio B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
that O
was O
given O
to O
us O
was O
much O
better O
than O
in O
the O
March O
report O
last O
year. O

The O
children's B-TARGET
room's I-TARGET
been O
marked, O
and O
we'll O
probably O
take O
the O
kids O
next O
time. O

I've O
had O
a O
positive O
effect O
on O
the O
complete O
absence O
of O
tobacco O
smoke. O

In O
general, O
this O
visit O
was O
a O
pleasant O
discovery O
that O
near O
the O
house O
there O
is O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
deliciously O
in O
a O
warm O
environment B-TARGET
for O
the O
family O
as O
a O
whole. O

At O
least O
now O
I O
know O
where O
you O
can O
get O
a O
nice O
pizza B-TARGET
near O
home, O
no O
worse O
than O
in O
northern O
Italy. O

There O
were O
two O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O

Beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
sitting O
by O
the O
window O
at O
the O
couch O
table. O

Much O
more O
comfortable O
than O
on O
the O
first O
floor. O

The O
pores B-TARGET
are O
small, O
but O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
good.)) O

The O
service B-TARGET
didn't O
like O
being O
cooked O
(or O
brought O
in?) O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
given O
that O
both O
times O
the O
restaurant O
was O
half O
empty... O

If O
it O
wasn't O
for O
that, O
you O
could O
call O
Mojo B-TARGET
a O
nice O
place O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
with O
your O
friends. O

13 O
January O
2014 O

It's O
our O
birthday O
party! O

We O
were O
five O
people, O
and O
it O
was O
Monday! O

There O
was O
table O
three O
in O
the O
room O
with O
us, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice. O

Our O
waiter B-TARGET
used O
to O
come O
up O
all O
night O
very O
often, O
see O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
and O
if O
we O
wanted O
something! O

Kalyan B-TARGET
is O
super! O

They O
ordered O
snacks, B-TARGET
cheese B-TARGET
balls, I-TARGET
fruit B-TARGET
- O
everything O
was O
very O
good!!!! O

It O
won't O
be O
long! O

We O
were O
satisfied!!! O

Thank O
you! O

Come O
to O
you O
again!!! O

Maybe O
the O
staff O
or O
the O
manager O
of O
the O
restaurant O
still O
reads O
the O
reviews O
and O
corrects... O
on O
this O
site O
lately, O
I've O
read O
the O
reviews O
a O
lot, O
but O
when O
they O
decide O
to O
stop O
by O
April, O
I O
haven't O
read O
anything O
about O
it. O

So O
I O
liked O
it. O

They O
were O
with O
their O
husband O
on O
Monday O
around O
8 O
p.m., O
met O
a O
girl, B-TARGET
walked O
to O
the O
table, O
and O
brought O
a O
menu. O

Just O
five O
minutes O
later, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
in, O
ordered, O
brought O
the O
spice O
and O
laid O
down O
the O
appliances, O
and O
the O
drinks O
quickly O
appeared O
on O
the O
table. O

In O
the O
ad, O
she O
saw O
that O
they O
had O
a O
children's B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
the O
waiter O
showed O
me O
where O
she O
wasn't O
much, O
but O
three O
or O
four O
kids O
would O
find O
something O
to O
do, O
have O
a O
TV, B-TARGET
a O
computer, B-TARGET
a O
chalkboard B-TARGET
and O
a O
drawing B-TARGET
table, I-TARGET
and O
my O
son O
would O
love O
it O
there. O

So, O
the O
salads O
came O
in O
20 O
minutes O
later, O
I O
ordered O
the O
tuna, B-TARGET
I O
really O
liked O
it, O
the O
Caesar's B-TARGET
husband I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
shrimp, O
not O
too O
excited, O
but O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
it. O

It's O
hot, O
mine's O
a O
white B-TARGET
mushroom I-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a O
good O
roast, B-TARGET
and O
I O
really O
liked O
it, O
and O
my O
husband O
ordered O
a O
marble B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
with O
something, O
and O
it's O
dry, O
but O
with O
the O
sauce, O
it's O
pretty O
cheesy. O

Dessert B-TARGET
and O
latte B-TARGET
were O
good. O

All O
the O
food B-TARGET
looked O
delicious, O
the O
size O
of O
the O
serving B-TARGET
is O
decent. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
ashtray O
was O
changed O
fast, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
guy O
tactfully O
helped O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
dessert. O

It's O
a O
3300 O
bill. O

If O
you O
do, O
we'll O
drop O
by O
for O
dessert O
with O
the O
baby. O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
pub O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
and O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
this O
is O
a O
pretty O
good O
place! B-TARGET

I O
really O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
which O
is O
pubian, O
but O
it's O
not O
obsessive O
and O
comfortable. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
good O
for O
fun O
and O
friendship. O

As O
far O
as O
service B-TARGET
is O
concerned, O
Saturday O
evening O
is O
acceptable. O

At O
the O
entrance, O
we O
were O
offered O
one O
of O
the O
few O
tables O
available, O
then O
the O
waiter O
brought O
the O
menu O
in O
a O
few O
minutes. O

He O
enjoyed O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
beers, B-TARGET
including I-TARGET
alcohol, I-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
appetizers B-TARGET
and O
various O
foods B-TARGET
for O
all O
tastes. O

I O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
such O
an O
extensive O
menu B-TARGET
in O
the O
pub! O

Although O
maybe O
it's O
too O
much... O
we've O
been O
waiting O
20 O
minutes O
for O
our O
order. O

Among O
the O
shortcomings, O
the O
waitress' B-TARGET
forgetfulness O
- O
a O
friend O
waited O
for O
his O
cigarettes O
only O
after O
a O
third O
request. O

But O
it O
can O
be O
compensated O
for O
by O
a O
very O
polite O
service. B-TARGET

From O
what O
I O
ordered, O
I O
liked O
the O
beer, B-TARGET
the O
most O
delicious O
beer! O

The O
cocktails B-TARGET
aren't O
bad, O
either. O

There's O
no O
claim O
for O
tortillas B-TARGET
and O
steaks, B-TARGET
and O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
groceries B-TARGET
in O
the O
Caesar. O

But O
the O
sushi B-TARGET
isn't O
a O
pub O
thing. O
It's O
not O
a O
pub O
dish. O

At O
the O
end, O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
bill, O
and O
then O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
15 O
minutes O
for O
the O
change. O

But O
we O
did O
have O
a O
good O
time! O

I O
think O
we'll O
come O
in O
more O
often. O

Prices, O
by O
the O
way, O
are O
also O
normal O
– O
average O
for O
these O
kinds O
of O
institutions, B-TARGET
not O
overestimated O
as O
many. O

I O
love O
Italian O
food. O

We O
went O
out O
with O
friends O
a O
few O
times, O
but O
they're O
all O
bad. O

It's O
cold, O
it's O
bad O
timing. O

First O
one O
girlfriend, O
then O
another, O
and O
I'm O
still O
15 O
minutes O
away. O

As O
a O
result, O
my O
friends O
had O
to O
eat O
everything O
cold. O

That O
time O
I O
got O
some O
fresh O
pasta, B-TARGET
buttered O
and O
stuffed O
cheese. O

It's O
not O
like O
pasta!!! B-TARGET

And O
this O
is O
prepared O
by O
professionals!???????????? O

Although, O
before O
this O
occasion, O
the O
dishes O
were O
tasty, O
but O
again O
they O
were O
taken O
out O
at O
the O
wrong O
time O
or O
at O
the O
same O
time O
(both O
salads O
and O
hot O
and O
pizza). O

They O
made O
a O
comment O
to O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
and O
she O
looks O
at O
us, O
slams O
her O
eyes O
and O
says, O
"What's O
wrong?" O

If O
you O
ask O
me O
to O
warm O
up, O
I've O
made O
you O
such O
a O
disgruntled O
face O
that O
you'd O
rather O
eat O
cold... O

And O
the O
dishes O
were O
mixed O
up. O

They O
ordered O
one, O
they O
brought O
another, O
and O
they O
didn't O
even O
apologize. O

How O
many O
times O
we've O
gone O
- O
each O
time O
we've O
gone O
with O
a O
bad O
mood!!!! O

Anyway, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
awful, O
I O
will O
never O
go O
there O
again!!! O

There's O
a O
nicer O
place O
in O
our O
neighborhood O
where O
you O
can O
rest, O
have O
a O
good O
meal, O
and O
have O
a O
good O
time! O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
twice. O

For O
the O
first O
time, O
one O
came O
in O
for O
lunch, O
immediately O
enjoyed O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
put O
away O
for O
a O
comfortable O
couch, B-TARGET
served O
quickly O
and O
without O
reproach, O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
bill, O
for O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
of O
a O
very O
inexpensive O
one O
in O
Nevsky. O

The O
second O
time O
he O
came O
with O
a O
girl, O
he O
pre-ordered O
a O
table O
where O
he O
sat O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
the B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
at O
a O
good O
level, O
a O
very O
good O
squid, B-TARGET
and O
the O
squid B-TARGET
was O
great. O

Have O
a O
nice O
time, O
the O
girl O
really O
liked O
it. O

I O
guess O
it O
wasn't O
the O
last O
time. O

They O
came O
into O
the O
appetit O
by O
accident. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
was O
a O
day O
off O
on O
Tuesday, O
September O
14, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
they O
decided O
to O
stay. O
We O
were O
met O
by O
a O
dark-haired O
manager, O
a O
thin-haired O
girl, O
who O
walked O
to O
the O
table O
and O
gave O
us O
a O
menu... O

Five O
minutes O
later, O
the O
waitress O
came O
in, O
took O
the O
order, O
and O
left... O

Looking O
around, O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
gonna O
take O
a O
long O
time-- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full, O
but O
we O
made O
a O
mistake, O
the O
wait O
was O
short-term-- O
acceptable O
to O
any O
institution, O
for O
a O
pleasant O
conversation, O
we O
didn't O
notice O
how O
long O
it O
was... O

Business B-TARGET
lunch, I-TARGET
surprisingly, O
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
well-satisfied-- O
well O
suited O
to O
its O
price. O

In O
general, O
a O
very O
good O
place, B-TARGET
a O
variety O
of O
tasty O
menus, B-TARGET
acceptable O
prices, O
and O
a O
high O
quality O
of O
service! B-TARGET
We O
really O
enjoyed O
everything. O
Thank O
you O
to O
this O
place! B-TARGET

I'm O
sure O
we'll O
come O
this O
weekend. O

There O
was O
a O
30-person O
wedding O
at O
Drago's O
restaurant O
on O
July O
1, O
2010. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
was O
picked O
by O
accident, O
more O
by O
location, O
but O
they O
didn't O
regret O
it. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
was O
small, O
but O
there O
was O
enough O
room O
for O
us O
to O
celebrate, O
and O
the O
veranda O
was O
at O
our O
disposal. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
light, O
and O
you O
feel O
comfortable O
in O
it. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good: O
tasty O
meats, B-TARGET
snacks B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tender I-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
amazing O
salads. B-TARGET

The O
guests O
liked O
the O
homemade B-TARGET
wine. I-TARGET

The O
first B-TARGET
meal I-TARGET
at O
the O
restaurant O
was O
excellent O
(the O
soup O
with O
the O
smoked B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
caviar I-TARGET
was O
tried O
at O
the O
next O
visit). O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
collection I-TARGET
deserves O
separate O
mention. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
warning. O

Svetlana's O
administrator B-TARGET
helped O
us O
with O
the O
dinner O
menu, O
and O
she O
took O
care O
of O
the O
hall B-TARGET
decorations, I-TARGET
and O
she O
took O
great O
care O
of O
us. O

Anyway, O
Drago's O
restaurant B-TARGET
leaves O
a O
very O
positive O
impression O
after O
the O
supper O
and O
after O
the O
family O
dinner. O

After O
a O
mixed O
impression O
of O
Harbin's O
restaurant O
on O
the O
Seaside, O
they O
decided O
to O
check O
their O
impressions O
of O
their O
first O
visit O
to O
the O
restaurant O
at O
the O
Academy. O

Tonight, O
around O
6 O
p.m., O
they O
came O
to O
Harbin's O
restaurant O
at O
the O
Academy. O

Places O
were O
in O
the O
smoking O
and O
non-smoker O
halls. O

The O
non-smoker B-TARGET
hall, I-TARGET
which O
is O
different O
from O
Harbin's O
at O
the O
Seaside, O
is O
completely O
separate O
from O
the O
smoking O
visitors. O

The B-TARGET
chairs I-TARGET
in O
the O
non-smoking O
room O
are O
European, O
very O
comfortable, O
unlike O
another O
room B-TARGET
where O
they're O
Chinese-style, O
but O
it's O
not O
convenient O
to O
sit O
on O
them. O

The O
order O
was O
received O
quickly, O
and O
what O
a O
surprise O
it O
was O
for O
us O
to O
have O
brought O
the O
first O
dish O
five O
minutes O
later. O

For O
15 O
minutes, O
the O
entire O
order O
was O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
food B-TARGET
at O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
tasty, O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of O
the O
cooking O
is O
much O
better O
for O
us O
than O
it O
was O
for O
Harbin O
at O
the O
Seaside O
(for O
comparison, O
several O
meals O
were O
ordered, O
just O
like O
in O
another O
restaurant). O

Special O
talk O
about O
tea. O

The O
choice O
here O
is O
much O
better O
and O
richer. O

Although O
there O
may O
have O
been O
more. O

It's O
nice O
that O
the O
tea B-TARGET
isn't O
packed O
as O
much O
as O
the O
seaside O
restaurant. O

There's O
good O
French B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
dry I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
on O
the O
menu. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
dishes O
cleaned O
up O
quickly O
and O
qualitatively, O
and O
the O
other O
little O
things O
were O
pleasant. O

Without O
alcohol, O
the O
bill O
for O
two O
was O
1,300 O
rubles. O

We O
recommend O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
visit. O

I'd O
like O
to O
share O
my O
impressions O
of O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
Krapiva O
restaurant. O

They O
celebrated O
the O
silver O
wedding O
on O
27 O
August O
2010. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
saw O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
I O
liked O
it. O

Good O
interior, B-TARGET
nice, O
well-educated O
administrator B-TARGET
Svetlana. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
choosing O
the O
menu. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
kept O
their O
eyes O
on O
the O
table O
while O
serving O
the O
party, O
so O
there O
wouldn't O
be O
empty O
plates, O
and O
it O
wouldn't O
be O
too O
obsessive. O

The O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased, O
too. O

At O
the O
bar, O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
helped O
with O
music, O
unfortunately O
I O
don't O
know O
all O
the O
names. O

I'd O
very O
much O
like O
you O
to O
visit O
a O
restaurant, B-TARGET
a O
home-made O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
so O
much, O
we'll O
go O
to O
this O
nice O
place B-TARGET
more O
than O
once O
and O
recommend O
it O
to O
our O
friends. O

A O
visit O
to O
the B-TARGET
Braves I-TARGET
will O
last O
forever!!! O

It's O
weird O
to O
have O
a O
table O
at O
the O
cafe, O
to O
come, O
and O
there's... O
no O
one. O

I O
mean, O
no O
visitors. O

It's O
like O
I O
didn't O
come O
to O
the O
cafe, O
but O
the O
guests, O
and O
you O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
waiting O
for O
you. O

Home O
interior, B-TARGET
yes, O
the O
atmosphere... O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
still O
being O
created O
by O
visitors, O
missing O
a O
bit O
of O
noise, O
voices, O
faces... O

In O
general, O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
gave O
a O
very O
pleasant O
impression. O

Little, O
cozy, O
souvenirs O
out O
of O
their O
own B-TARGET
tasty I-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
are O
ploughing O
off O
waiting O
for O
a O
meal. O

There's O
no O
beer, B-TARGET
but O
it O
looks O
like O
it's O
supposed O
to O
be O
in O
this O
format. O

The O
mind O
is O
looking O
for O
negatives O
and O
clues, O
and O
they O
are... O

But O
the O
impression O
is O
on O
the O
emotions O
- O
they're O
only O
positive O
from O
the O
visit! O

We O
went O
in O
with O
our O
wife O
and O
the O
baby. O

The O
background O
music O
is O
Radio O
Ermitage. O

The O
weather O
was O
hot, O
sat O
down O
in O
the O
second O
room, O
and O
it O
was O
cooler. O

The O
food B-TARGET
wasn't O
disappointing, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
exciting O
either. O

The B-TARGET
rates I-TARGET
are O
decent. O

The O
waiter O
girl O
and O
the O
cashier O
in O
one O
person, O
most O
of O
the O
time, O
was O
in O
the O
first O
room, O
and O
did O
not O
always O
control O
when O
to O
remove O
the O
plates O
or O
respond O
to O
new O
desires. O

They O
gave O
us O
a O
15 O
percent O
discount O
card O
for O
the O
neighbor, O
and O
they O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

Come O
again. O

Hello! O

We O
visited O
your O
establishment O
yesterday O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
and O
it O
wasn't O
possible O
to O
walk O
by, O
until O
a O
couple O
of O
dinners O
with O
your O
family O
in O
Nesco, O
and O
we O
weren't O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
service. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
know O
that O
visiting O
your O
establishment B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
marathon I-TARGET
has O
changed O
my O
attitude O
to O
the O
best. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
all O
the O
halls B-TARGET
were O
full O
tonight, O
and O
on O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
it O
was O
still O
cool O
to O
sit O
with O
the O
baby, O
and O
we O
were O
met O
by O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
who O
offered O
us O
a O
few O
tables O
where O
we O
could O
sit, O
and O
that O
the O
girl B-TARGET
had O
already O
led O
us O
to O
the O
table O
(unfortunately O
unremembered) O
by O
the O
look O
of O
the O
administrator, B-TARGET
and O
she O
had O
served O
the O
menu, O
which O
was O
most O
surprising O
to O
us O
by O
pouring O
absolutely O
free O
water O
on O
the O
glasses, O
it O
was O
very O
pleasant. O

I O
didn't O
even O
know O
you O
had O
that O
in O
the O
Neves O
prospectus, O
for O
two O
of O
my O
visits. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
non-addictive. O
It O
makes O
you O
feel O
at O
home. O

We O
usually O
like O
to O
eat O
somewhere O
in O
the O
evenings, O
and O
even O
a O
little O
bit O
surprised O
that O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
is O
helping O
with O
the O
choices, O
usually O
where O
you O
don't O
turn O
the O
shadows O
in O
the O
hall O
by O
the O
cashier's O
office, O
something O
to O
mumbling O
the O
waiters. O

Brought O
us O
an O
order O
from O
a O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
literally O
20 O
minutes O
later, O
and O
the O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
started. O

Well, O
I O
went O
to O
dinner O
tonight. O

Special O
thanks O
to O
the O
girl B-TARGET
for O
the O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
to O
the O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
who's O
the O
type O
of O
employee B-TARGET
who O
wants O
to O
be O
in O
a O
peteric O
institution. O

I O
think O
we'll O
visit O
you O
again. O

I O
once O
saw O
a O
new O
restaurant O
open O
on O
the O
spot. O

The O
view O
from O
the O
Nevsky O
window O
made O
me O
look O
in O
there. O

And O
the O
interior B-TARGET
didn't O
disappoint O
me, O
but, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
it O
was O
very O
happy. O

It's O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
cozy O
place. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
very O
nice. O

Our O
waiter B-TARGET
had O
to O
explain O
a O
lot O
to O
us, O
because O
I O
didn't O
know O
Asian O
food O
like O
that. O

But O
he O
offered O
a O
lot, O
described O
a O
lot, O
helped O
to O
choose. O

My O
friend O
and O
I O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
that O
choice. O

I O
got O
coconut O
soup O
with O
seafood. O

It O
was O
sharp, O
but O
I O
understand O
it's O
a O
specialty O
of O
the O
kitchen. O

But O
I O
love O
the O
spicy O
one, O
and O
I O
was O
excited O
about O
the O
meal. B-TARGET

A O
friend O
ordered O
a O
salad O
with O
oranges, O
hand O
and O
salmon, O
and O
for O
dessert O
we O
took O
mang O
mousse O
and O
lemon O
dessert. O

We O
loved O
everything. O

It O
was O
delicious!!!!!!! O

I O
advise O
everyone O
to O
visit O
this O
institution!!!!! B-TARGET

On O
April O
27, O
they O
went O
out O
with O
their O
wife O
on O
Pushkin O
and O
came O
by O
for O
a O
bite O
to O
eat. O

They O
ordered O
pork O
barbecues, O
grilled O
vegetables, O
Idaho O
potatoes O
for O
home-made O
Morse O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
French O
white O
dry O
wine. O

Which O
I O
liked. O

It's O
really O
good, O
it's O
a O
big O
shampoo B-TARGET
with O
an O
original O
setup. O

When O
it O
comes O
in, O
it O
burns. O

The O
vegetables B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill O
and O
Idaho B-TARGET
are O
very O
good, O
too. O

In O
short, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
great. O

The O
restaurant's O
interior B-TARGET
didn't O
make O
a O
big O
impression O
on O
me. O

At O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
glass-pack B-TARGET
walls I-TARGET
feeling O
like O
you're O
in O
the O
greenhouse. O

But O
there's O
something O
about O
that, O
too. O

I O
liked O
the O
service, B-TARGET
but O
there O
was O
one O
thing, O
but O
when O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
ordered O
the O
waitress, O
she O
offered O
to O
take O
a O
500-mlt O
Morse, O
and O
brought O
the O
tall, O
thin O
200-mlt O
glasses. O

I O
wasn't O
paying O
attention O
at O
all. O

And O
at O
the O
end, O
when O
she O
told O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
about O
it, O
she O
was O
very O
embarrassed. O

I O
don't O
think-- O
I O
don't O
care O
about O
that, O
there'd O
be O
a O
sum O
of O
two O
times O
500 O
ml O
in O
the O
account, O
not O
two O
times O
200 O
ml. O

It's O
just O
my O
guess, O
though. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
young O
woman O
and O
a O
young O
man. O

Quick, O
polite, O
careful. O

I O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
an O
order. O

Cleaning O
the O
dishes O
that O
were O
used O
quickly. O

All O
kind O
and O
smiley. O

The O
bill O
was O
brought O
to O
2050 O
rubles. O

I O
don't O
think O
it's O
a O
bad O
place. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

They O
came O
into O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
with O
a O
friend O
on O
the O
parents' O
recommendation, O
and O
they O
were O
very O
fond O
of O
them O
recently! O

So O
are O
we!! O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
we O
sat O
in O
the O
first O
room, O
the O
curtains B-TARGET
were O
great, O
and O
there O
were O
a O
couple O
of O
paintings B-TARGET
that O
I O
really O
wanted O
to O
have O
at O
home. O

The O
food's B-TARGET
pretty O
good, O
too, O
cooked O
fast O
enough, O
took O
a O
boat O
full O
of O
vegetables B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
rice, I-TARGET
it O
was O
delicious, O
and O
Borgia's B-TARGET
incredible I-TARGET
coffee, I-TARGET
never O
tasted O
it O
before! O

My O
friend O
took O
one O
of O
the O
east B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
and O
unfortunately O
I O
couldn't O
reproduce O
the O
exact O
name, O
but O
I O
was O
happy O
too! O

Americano B-TARGET
didn't O
disappoint O
her O
either! O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
had O
on O
Friday O
night O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
slow, O
the O
girl O
and O
the O
young O
man O
who O
were O
there O
were O
more O
busy O
doing O
their O
business! O

There's O
no O
more O
talk O
about O
this O
place, O
in O
principle) O

Overall O
conclusion:.......................................................................... B-TARGET

A O
very O
emotional O
and O
warm O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
created O
for O
us O
at O
the O
Prospect O
restaurant. O

We've O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
our O
friends' O
meeting O
here. O

In O
the O
Peterburg O
style, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
everything O
is O
delicious, O
the O
fine O
layout B-TARGET
of O
the O
table O
and O
the O
individual O
dishes. B-TARGET

Prices O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

Everyone O
was O
happy O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
great O
evening. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

Being O
with O
a O
friend, O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
Italian O
food, O
could O
not O
help O
but O
visit O
the O
place. O

It O
was O
a O
weekday O
when O
a O
tortured O
girl B-TARGET
met O
us O
at O
the O
entrance, O
saying O
that O
there O
were O
no O
places... O
looking O
back, O
and O
really O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
busy. O

We O
decided O
not O
to O
give O
up, O
and O
we O
offered O
to O
wait O
if O
any O
table O
came O
out. O

She O
immediately O
said O
there O
were O
tables O
downstairs, O
but O
there's O
no O
light... O
during O
this O
conversation, O
the O
lights O
were O
turned O
on O
downstairs O
and O
we O
were O
led O
down... O

Sit O
down O
at O
the O
table O
for O
two, O
there O
was O
a O
noisy O
company O
sitting O
next O
to O
him, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
noisy O
in O
general. O

A B-TARGET
menu O
of... O
a O
few O
laminated O
leaves: O
a O
lot O
of O
paste, B-TARGET
pizza, B-TARGET
and O
few O
salads B-TARGET
and O
snacks. B-TARGET

A O
man O
who O
doesn't O
know O
about O
Italian O
food O
will O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
understand. O

A O
very O
small O
choice O
of O
wine. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
came O
up O
pretty O
fast, O
took O
the O
order. O

The O
drinks O
were O
served O
quickly, O
too. O

The B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
cappuccino, I-TARGET
in O
a O
big O
mug, O
very O
good, O
champagne B-TARGET
isn't O
bad. O

The O
kitchen... B-TARGET
we O
didn't O
like O
it. O

I O
won't O
go O
into O
detail O
compared O
to O
other O
Italian O
restaurants O
where O
we O
ate. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
price O
corresponds O
to O
the O
quality. O

It's O
not O
a O
restaurant, O
it's O
a O
cafe. O

The O
impression O
is O
generally O
quite O
pleasant. O

Good O
afternoon, O
everyone! O

We O
go O
to O
an O
ISS O
restaurant O
in O
Moscow O
to O
have O
lunch O
with O
colleagues O
almost O
every O
day, O
usually O
a O
company O
of O
5-6 O
people, O
before O
this O
incident O
we O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
the O
maintenance, B-TARGET
the O
beautiful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
but O
our O
lunch B-TARGET
was O
filled O
with O
human O
hair!!!!!!!! O

Black O
and O
dense, O
perfectly O
wrapped O
on O
a O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
that O
hit O
me O
in O
the O
mouth. O

A O
good O
mood O
went O
away O
with O
an O
appetite. O

Of O
course O
I O
was O
offered O
a O
change O
of O
course, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
desire O
to O
eat O
anymore! O

I O
don't O
think O
I'm O
going O
to O
have O
a O
desire, O
or O
my O
colleagues, O
to O
attend O
this O
institution B-TARGET
anytime O
soon. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
in O
this O
restaurant O
was O
a O
few O
years O
ago. O

That's O
when O
I O
liked O
the O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
big O
meals B-TARGET
plus O
the O
humane O
prices. O

Sitting O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O

The O
hall B-TARGET
is O
cute, O
the O
service B-TARGET
isn't O
extraordinary, O
but O
it's O
not O
obsessive. O

The O
impression O
was O
positive. O

I O
recently O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
with O
a O
small O
company O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
here O
and O
freshen O
up O
my O
memories. O

As O
before, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
prices O
are O
decent. O

It's B-TARGET
a O
big O
menu. O
It's O
a O
long O
choice. O

Sitting O
on O
the O
first O
floor. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
interesting. O
I've O
never O
seen O
anything O
like O
it O
before. O

The O
guests, O
and O
I O
liked O
it O
as O
a O
whole. O

Resting O
with O
our O
friends, O
walking O
around, O
celebrating O
our O
friend's O
birthday, O
deciding O
to O
go O
to O
Tres O
Amigos' O
restaurant O
was O
a O
great O
pleasure O
to O
us O
right O
away. O

Since O
we O
don't O
all O
smoke, O
we O
were O
led O
by O
friendly O
and O
smiling O
waiters B-TARGET
to O
a O
non-smoker O
room, O
the O
room B-TARGET
was O
spacious O
and O
bright, O
cozy O
enough! O

I'd O
like O
to O
celebrate O
the O
work O
of O
the O
staff: B-TARGET
all O
the O
very O
friendly O
and O
smiling O
guys, O
Olya O
our O
waiter B-TARGET
took O
us O
to O
the O
table, O
offered O
us O
drinks, O
offered O
her O
help O
with O
the O
food, O
told O
us O
in O
detail O
that O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
to O
read O
the O
menu! O

We O
got O
drinks O
right O
away, O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long, O
everything O
was O
fast O
and O
fast, O
even O
though O
there O
weren't O
many O
guests O
at O
the O
restaurant O
at O
the O
time! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
meals B-TARGET
were O
big!!!!!!! O

We O
felt O
at O
home O
all O
night!!!!! O

This O
restaurant O
enjoyed O
all O
the O
incendiary O
dances B-TARGET
(which O
were O
evening) O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
very O
tasty O
cocktails! B-TARGET

So O
we've O
opened O
up O
a O
new O
establishment B-TARGET
that O
we're O
going O
to O
go O
to O
all O
the O
time O
now, O
where O
everyone O
smiles O
at O
you O
and O
where O
you're O
happy O
to O
see.))) O

Tres B-TARGET
Amigos, I-TARGET
you O
are O
the O
best!!!!! O

This O
institution B-TARGET
was O
visited O
for O
the O
first O
time O
by O
accident, O
after O
which O
it O
became O
quite O
frequent, O
and O
it O
was O
nice O
to O
see O
familiar O
faces O
among O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
since O
unfortunately O
it O
changed O
very O
often O
at O
one O
time. O

Monday O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
they O
had O
come, O
and O
they O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
hear O
the O
songs B-TARGET
of O
PLEASE!) O

Anything O
will O
be O
found O
for O
you. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
kitchen's B-TARGET
concerned, O
it's O
pretty O
quick O
and O
tasty, O
and O
I'd O
like O
to O
mention O
beef B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
steaks! I-TARGET

The O
only O
thing O
that O
happened O
was O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
on O
Thursday, O
the O
Japanese O
kitchen O
wasn't O
working. O

Separately O
thank O
you O
for O
serving B-TARGET
sweet O
Tatyane, O
very O
often O
getting O
into O
it, O
and O
always O
getting O
nice O
and O
quality O
service, B-TARGET
always O
advise O
and O
answer O
a O
joke, O
you O
see O
a O
girl B-TARGET
with O
a O
sense O
of O
humor. O

Thank O
you! O

Hello. O

I O
don't O
write O
a O
lot O
about O
restaurants, O
and O
it's O
not O
just O
bad, O
it's O
a O
good O
impression, O
it's O
a O
tip, O
and O
it's O
a O
thank O
you O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

Here O
we O
go. O

We O
went O
there O
with O
a O
company O
of O
seven O
people, O
two O
of O
whom O
were O
children. O

Some O
20% O
of O
the O
tables O
were O
occupied, O
but O
the O
request O
for O
another O
menu O
was O
answered O
that O
there O
was O
no O
one O
available. O

We O
took O
advantage O
of O
their O
offer O
for O
pasta B-TARGET
and O
sushi. B-TARGET

The O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
like O
a O
swelling O
pasta B-TARGET
with O
an O
incomprehensible O
sauce, B-TARGET
and O
the O
sushi O
was O
delicious, O
but O
it O
was O
prepared O
for O
exactly O
1 O
hour O
and O
20 O
minutes O
(as O
I've O
already O
written O
at O
a O
virtually O
empty O
restaurant). O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
explained O
the O
delay O
by O
a O
very O
large O
volume O
of O
orders, O
and O
after O
comments O
she O
stopped O
coming O
to O
us O
at O
all. O

The O
hot B-TARGET
towels I-TARGET
asked O
several O
times O
were O
never O
brought. O

I O
wasn't O
given O
a O
book O
of O
complaint O
either O
(probably O
it O
doesn't O
contain O
free O
sheets). O

Everything O
could O
be O
good: O
location, B-TARGET
interior, B-TARGET
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
the O
organization B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
work I-TARGET
is O
terrible, O
it's O
just O
not O
clear O
who's O
doing O
it. O

And O
don't O
organize O
any O
stock O
if O
you O
have O
one O
chef B-TARGET
and O
he O
can't O
service O
four O
tables O
at O
once! O

And O
the O
waitress's B-TARGET
girlfriend, I-TARGET
seeing O
that O
the O
kids O
are O
with O
us, O
could O
have O
warned O
us O
that O
the O
average O
waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
for O
food O
is O
1 O
- O
1.5 O
hours!!!!!!!!!! O

I O
think O
such O
an O
institution B-TARGET
will O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
predecessors. O

We O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Pab O
No. O
1 O
Friday O
night O
with O
our O
friends. O

I've O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
him, O
but O
I've O
never O
heard O
of O
him, O
and O
there's O
a O
case O
that O
came O
up... O
we O
got O
a O
table, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
up O
in O
just O
a O
few O
minutes. O

As O
for O
the O
menu, O
there's O
a O
pretty O
big O
beer B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
in O
the O
pub. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
I O
didn't O
think O
it O
was O
appropriate O
to O
have O
a O
sushi B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
in O
the O
pub. O

I'm O
sick O
of O
the O
institutions O
that O
mix O
all O
the O
formats O
in O
a O
row. O

If O
he O
was O
a O
pub, B-TARGET
he'd O
still O
be O
a O
pub... O
but O
at O
his O
own O
peril, O
I O
couldn't O
resist O
the O
temptation O
and O
ordered O
my O
favorite O
sushi, O
even O
though O
I'd O
decided O
many O
times... O
if O
I O
didn't O
get O
too O
much O
fun, O
the O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
basically O
normal, O
but... O
somehow O
I O
was O
a O
little O
short O
on O
it O
so O
I O
could O
really O
enjoy O
it. O

The O
friends O
ordered O
their O
pasta B-TARGET
foam I-TARGET
and O
steak B-TARGET
- O
they O
liked O
both O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
size O
of O
the O
servings. B-TARGET

As O
much O
as O
everyone O
liked O
the O
beer, B-TARGET
and O
the O
choice O
is O
big O
enough, O
as O
it O
should O
be O
in O
Pub. O

We O
were O
served O
fast O
enough, O
and O
there's O
no O
problem O
with O
the O
interior B-TARGET
either. O

The O
conclusion O
is O
to O
come O
to O
Pab, B-TARGET
but O
especially O
picky O
to O
the O
Japanese O
kitchen, O
to O
order O
sushi O
better O
in O
specially O
designated O
places. O

The O
restaurant O
with O
the O
girl O
was O
visited O
today. O

I O
really O
liked O
it. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
great, O
all O
from O
the O
tree, O
and O
it's O
beautiful! O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
careful O
and O
non-addictive! O

Nice O
music! B-TARGET

As O
far O
as O
the O
kitchen's O
concerned, O
I'm O
excited O
about O
the O
warm B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
the B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
steak! I-TARGET

I O
can't O
help O
noticing O
salmon B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
soup! I-TARGET

You O
guys O
are O
really O
good. O
It's O
really O
good. O

And O
"worthy" O
portions. B-TARGET

Anyway, O
it O
was O
nice O
to O
be O
surprised O
at O
such O
a O
wonderful O
place, B-TARGET
and O
we'll O
come O
again, O
and O
more O
than O
once! O

I O
was O
in O
a O
place O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
on O
Friday. O

Very O
good. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
still O
has O
a O
lot O
to O
work O
on, O
of O
course, O
but O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

They O
ordered O
salads O
and O
hot O
pork O
steaks. O

They O
brought O
it O
in O
fast. O

They O
don't O
have O
hard O
alcohol, B-TARGET
but O
they O
don't O
have O
beer O
yet, O
apparently, O
with O
a O
license O
problem, O
but O
the O
honey B-TARGET
tree I-TARGET
was O
very O
nice. O

I'd O
like O
to O
have O
a O
little O
more O
variety O
on O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
but O
since O
they've O
just O
opened O
up, O
I O
think O
they're O
gonna O
get O
better O
eventually. O

The O
institution O
was O
selected O
to O
meet O
with O
friends O
mainly O
because O
of O
the O
reviews. O

Well, O
first O
of O
all, O
I'd O
like O
to O
point O
out O
one O
little O
disappointment O
that O
came O
to O
me O
right O
away: O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

I O
really O
expected O
to O
see O
something O
more. O

I'm O
not O
gonna O
be O
boring O
to O
write O
what's O
wrong O
or O
what's O
wrong. O

It's O
just O
that O
there's O
a O
feeling O
that O
such O
an O
interesting O
idea O
of O
gangster B-TARGET
bar-a I-TARGET
hasn't O
been O
fully O
realized. O

Black O
and O
white O
posters, O
brick O
walls... O

Second O
of O
all, O
meeting B-TARGET
guests I-TARGET
at O
the O
restaurant-- O
absent, O
waiting... O
looking, O
a O
couple O
of O
waiters B-TARGET
doing O
their O
jobs... O

Without O
waiting O
for O
any O
attention O
to O
be O
paid O
to O
us, O
they O
approached O
the O
nearest O
waitress B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
and O
asked O
us O
to O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
table O
they O
had O
ordered O
earlier. O

We O
did. O

Sit O
down. O

It O
was O
better. O

The O
order O
was O
received O
quickly, O
the O
food O
was O
delivered O
quickly O
enough, O
the O
empty O
plates O
were O
removed, O
and O
the O
glasses O
were O
in O
time. O

The O
food B-TARGET
itself O
corresponds O
to O
the O
style O
chosen O
by O
the O
institution. B-TARGET

It's O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal, O
though. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
smiling, O
friendly. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired-- O
for O
cheese O
enthusiasts, O
it's O
just O
too O
little:) O

Cesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
is O
a O
plate O
of O
cabbage, O
and O
three O
thin O
slices O
of O
chicken, B-TARGET
souharics, O
sauce. O

There's O
nothing O
more O
to O
talk O
about. O

In O
the O
end, O
I'd O
like O
to O
conclude O
that O
the O
price-quality O
ratio O
is O
good. O

It's O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
big O
company. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
interesting. O

We've O
been O
there O
quite O
often O
and O
we've O
never O
been O
disappointed. O

The O
interior O
is O
divided O
into O
three O
floors O
on O
each O
of O
its O
own. O

I O
don't O
like O
the O
first O
one. O

For O
some O
reason, O
it O
doesn't O
feel O
like O
the O
dining B-TARGET
room. I-TARGET

Chairs B-TARGET
aren't O
comfortable. O

Lots O
of O
tables B-TARGET
downtown. O

It O
doesn't O
feel O
good. O

The O
third, O
as O
I O
understand O
it, O
is O
mostly O
for O
feasts... O
nothing O
special O
either. O

The O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy. O

The O
sofas... O

The O
muffled O
light... B-TARGET
and O
all O
that. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
quite O
diverse. O

I O
really O
like O
salmon B-TARGET
caesar. I-TARGET
(Very O
fresh, O
crisp, O
and O
most O
important O
with O
very O
little B-TARGET
salty I-TARGET
fish) I-TARGET

Beef O
is O
diJon. O

It's O
brought O
right O
on O
the O
pan, O
baked O
under O
cheese B-TARGET
and O
tomatoes. B-TARGET

It's O
delicious. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
very O
good!!! O

Frozen B-TARGET
parfe I-TARGET
is O
so O
excited! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Of O
course, O
there's O
something O
that's O
gonna O
go O
wrong... O
but O
in O
this O
case, O
there's O
some O
kind O
of O
compliment. B-TARGET

Prices O
are O
slightly O
higher O
than O
average. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
just O
as O
good O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
as O
it O
is O
for O
a O
birthday O
party. O

We'll O
definitely O
go O
back O
there O
again. O

I've O
been O
reading O
reports O
about O
this O
restaurant, O
and O
I've O
decided O
to O
visit O
it. O

I O
was O
expecting O
a O
quiet O
horror, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
the O
other O
way O
around, O
and O
now O
I'm O
not O
gonna O
trust O
feedback, O
I'm O
gonna O
check O
it O
out. O

I O
came O
in O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
Thursday O
afternoon, O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch. O

We O
were O
met O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
who O
walked O
into O
a O
non-smoker O
room, O
and O
it O
wasn't O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
to O
say, O
after O
reading O
the O
reviews, O
that O
I O
was O
expecting O
to O
sit O
in O
an O
empty O
room, O
but O
no, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
tables O
available O
by O
the O
aisle, O
and O
we O
sat O
down. O

I O
ordered O
a O
salad, B-TARGET
a O
bigger O
meal, O
but O
strangely O
it O
was O
brought O
in O
in O
large O
quantities, O
from O
a O
hot O
veal B-TARGET
steak, I-TARGET
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
soft O
and O
juicy, O
and, O
of O
course, O
my O
favorite O
is O
dessert, O
ordered O
a O
tiramisa, B-TARGET
and O
right O
did O
a O
very O
tasty O
dessert. B-TARGET

From O
now O
on, O
they'll O
always O
have O
it. O

I O
liked O
the O
service, B-TARGET
everyone O
brought O
it O
quickly O
enough, O
the O
plates O
used O
on O
the O
table O
weren't O
delayed, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
served O
everyone O
fast, O
I O
was O
following O
them O
on O
purpose.) O
) O
) O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
compare O
the O
reviews O
to O
reality O
).......................................................................................................... O

And O
as O
for O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
I O
liked O
the O
calm, O
relaxed, O
clean O
and O
neat, O
without O
the O
paphos. O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
2009, O
they O
were O
with O
their O
wife O
at O
the O
restaurant O
twice. O

What O
there's O
no O
problem O
with O
is O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
the O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
the O
beer. B-TARGET

It's O
very O
cozy. O
(Don't O
forget, O
it's O
a O
beer O
restaurant O
with O
an O
atmosphere B-TARGET
like O
this.) O

It's O
a O
rich O
menu, B-TARGET
there's O
a O
lot O
to O
choose O
from. O

It's B-TARGET
all O
over O
the O
place. O

Nice O
dark B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
(no O
light, O
no O
more O
respect O
for O
dark O
beer). O

Somewhere O
there's O
a O
comment O
about O
rough O
and O
rough O
waitresses-- O
that's O
not O
true. O

Both O
were O
very O
politely O
served O
and O
satisfied. O

Maybe O
a O
little O
longer O
than O
I'd O
like O
to, O
but O
first O
of O
all, O
it O
depends O
not O
only O
on O
waitresses, O
but O
also O
on O
cooks, O
and O
secondly, O
long O
waiting O
has O
been O
compensated O
by O
courtesy O
and O
care. O

It's O
just O
a O
question O
for O
the O
chefs. O

Both O
orders O
were O
almost O
the O
same, O
but O
if O
the O
first O
time O
it O
was O
insanely O
tasty, O
the O
second O
gave O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
students O
were O
preparing. O

Guess O
we O
got O
another O
shift. O

I O
can't O
say O
the O
second O
time O
was O
unfoodable. O

It's O
okay. O

But O
no O
more. O

But O
the O
contrast O
with O
the O
first O
time O
on O
your O
face. O

Even O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
dish. O

Maybe O
this O
second O
shift O
hurt O
that O
day O
who O
:) O

We'll O
go O
back O
to O
Peter O
in O
May O
with O
our O
friends, O
and O
we'll O
definitely O
go O
to O
Goose. B-TARGET

Let's O
hope O
we O
get O
the O
first O
shift. O

I O
read O
the O
latest O
reviews, O
and O
I O
was O
very O
surprised. O

The O
thing O
is, O
I've O
been O
a O
regular O
visitor O
to O
Tokyo B-TARGET
for O
years, O
and O
I O
think O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places B-TARGET
to O
go O
in O
our O
neighborhood. O

I O
haven't O
had O
much O
trouble O
with O
them O
yet. O

A O
very O
tasty O
meal B-TARGET
(and O
the O
main O
fresh O
fish!), B-TARGET
which O
is O
cheap, O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
diversify O
the O
Japanese B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
European B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

Absolutely O
adequate O
staff, B-TARGET
nice O
interior. B-TARGET

The O
only O
minus-- O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
to O
order, O
and O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
find O
a O
free O
table, O
but O
we've O
always O
booked O
a O
table O
on O
the O
phone O
lately, O
and O
there O
were O
no O
linings. O
I'd O
like O
to O
say O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Tokyo, B-TARGET
we're O
with O
you! O
p.s. O
There's O
always O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
out O
there, O
I O
think O
it's O
a O
sign O
that O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad. O
So O
many O
people O
can't O
be O
wrong. O

Nice O
and O
warm O
home O
environment! B-TARGET

Nice O
and O
responsive O
staff, B-TARGET
very O
careful O
service. B-TARGET

Food, B-TARGET
should O
we O
say O
it's O
hard O
to O
surprise O
a O
man O
who's O
used O
to O
and O
knows O
Georgian O
cuisine? O

I O
can O
say O
one O
thing, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised! O

Thanks O
to O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
he's O
getting O
the O
feeling O
that O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
special O
place B-TARGET
where O
everyone O
feels O
like O
they're O
welcome! O
(c)) O
(c)) O
(c)) O
(c)) O

I O
love O
this O
place B-TARGET
very O
much, O
I'm O
there O
every O
week, O
and O
I O
think O
I'm O
gonna O
visit O
as O
often O
as O
I O
do, O
because O
it's O
perfect O
for O
me O
in O
every O
way. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
calm O
and O
comfortable, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
exactly O
the O
kind O
of O
one O
you O
need, O
it O
doesn't O
attract O
much O
attention, O
but, O
in O
general, O
it's O
nice O
and O
hateful, O
it's O
very O
relaxing, O
and O
music B-TARGET
helps. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice, O
maybe O
because O
all O
the O
people O
I O
know O
are, O
I O
don't O
know, O
so O
it's O
possible O
there's O
a O
partial O
assessment, O
but O
that O
was O
the O
impression O
of O
the O
first O
visit. O

Kitchen... B-TARGET
it's O
something. O

Everything O
I've O
tried O
in O
this O
place O
is O
great! O

Everything! O

The O
pasta, B-TARGET
especially, O
is O
a O
miracle, O
I O
think O
we O
should O
try O
everyone. O

With O
desserts, O
you O
should O
try O
a O
warm O
chocolate B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vanilla I-TARGET
ice O
cream O
-- O
very... O

Who O
hasn't O
been O
to O
this O
place, B-TARGET
I O
think O
it's O
worth O
a O
visit, O
and O
for O
the O
panoramic B-TARGET
view, I-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
good O
food, B-TARGET
and O
just O
to O
dive O
into O
the O
relaxing O
environment B-TARGET
of O
the O
7th O
sky. O

This O
weekend, O
she O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
table O
ordered O
it O
in O
advance, O
asked O
me O
to O
put O
it O
in O
a O
nicer O
place, O
didn't O
disappoint O
it, O
put O
it O
where O
they O
wanted O
it O
to O
be. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
playing O
calm O
music. B-TARGET

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
enjoyed O
it O
very O
much, O
especially O
meat B-TARGET
(beef B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
hand) I-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
(pearl B-TARGET
napoleon). I-TARGET

All O
the O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased, O
thank O
you O
very O
much!!! O

Lucky O
for O
the O
service, B-TARGET
there O
was O
a O
lovely O
girl B-TARGET
who O
explained O
and O
answered O
all O
the O
questions O
with O
a O
smile. O

We'll O
come O
again! O

I O
went O
to O
this O
place O
after O
work O
for O
dinner. O

The O
friendly O
girls B-TARGET
met, O
asked O
if O
there O
was O
a O
reservation. O

I O
didn't O
book O
the O
table O
in O
advance, O
so O
I O
went O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
and O
offered O
to O
sit O
by O
the O
stairs. O

Therefore, O
he O
concluded O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
make O
a O
reservation O
in O
a O
more O
convenient O
place O
in O
advance. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
nice, O
always O
watching O
visitors, O
so O
they O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long, O
which O
is O
nice. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
is O
quite O
interesting, O
it's O
more O
eastern-oriented, O
but O
most O
of O
all, O
it's O
very O
democratic O
at O
prices. O

First O
time O
I O
tried O
fried B-TARGET
octopus, I-TARGET
of O
course O
I O
had O
nothing O
to O
compare O
with, O
but O
I O
liked O
it) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
cute, O
there's O
not O
much O
lighting, O
but O
the O
candles B-TARGET
are O
put O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
walls O
give O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
wine O
cellar. O

I O
think O
if O
we're O
gonna O
find O
a O
cozy, O
low-cost O
place B-TARGET
on O
the O
subway O
in O
Moscow, O
that's O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
best O
options. O

I O
think O
I'm O
gonna O
go O
over O
there O
again! O

On O
Friday O
(19 O
March O
2010), O
they O
booked O
a O
table O
for O
their O
parents' O
holiday O
on O
Sunday, O
and O
they O
tried O
a O
little O
kitchen O
on O
their O
own. O

They O
took O
a O
shabby O
from O
Azeirbajanski O
(from O
Ovine), O
Hachipuri O
Imerite, O
Bayram O
salad, O
and O
grill O
vegetables. O

Hachipuri B-TARGET
got O
a O
little O
pumped O
up, O
seemed O
like O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
cheese, B-TARGET
though O
probably O
for O
an O
amateur. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
is O
juicy O
and O
delicious, O
the O
lamb B-TARGET
and O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
are O
very O
decent. O

The O
service B-TARGET
gives O
a O
nice O
impression. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
isn't O
obsessive, O
but O
nice... O
a O
very O
good O
combination. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
didn't O
appreciate... O
at O
the O
level, O
but O
no O
more, O
although O
it O
might O
not O
be O
necessary O
for O
a O
nice O
dinner B-TARGET
anymore. O

My O
parents O
were O
very O
happy. O

I O
am O
particularly O
grateful O
to O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
who O
worked O
these O
days O
(unfortunately, O
the O
girl's O
name O
was O
not O
remembered). O

I O
really O
wanted O
my O
parents O
to O
like O
it, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
above O
praise. O

It O
was O
March O
8, O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

We O
used O
to O
go O
to O
the O
pub O
on O
Stuckek O
until O
we O
were O
really O
disappointed. O

Everything's O
ruined! O

The O
waiters O
work O
awful, O
you O
don't O
know, O
everything's O
gonna O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time, O
what O
they O
brought O
out O
of O
food-- O
like O
in O
a O
dining O
room, O
something O
cold, O
something O
bad. O

On O
March O
8, O
they O
offered O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Bill O
Hook O
in O
Kupcino. O

Once O
again, O
I O
was O
surprised O
(in O
a O
good O
way). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
looks O
like O
the O
first O
pub, O
pretty O
cozy: O
couchs, B-TARGET
fireplace. B-TARGET

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
and O
we O
have O
to O
say O
that O
we O
served O
him O
so O
we O
didn't O
want O
to O
leave O
afterwards.)) O

With O
jokes, O
with O
a O
good O
mood, O
quick, O
good O
and O
good. O

In O
fact, O
we O
all O
loved O
it, O
we'll O
be O
regular O
guests!!!! O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
this O
great O
place! B-TARGET

What O
I O
can O
say O
is, O
"OH, O
OOOOOOOOOOO, O
OOOOOOOOO O
OOOO, O
OOOOOO O
OOO O
O O
O O
O O
O O
O O
O O
O O
O O
O O
O O
O!!" O
I O
read O
the O
reviews, O
I O
think O
I O
live O
on O
another O
planet, O
all O
the O
lies O
written!!!! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
isn't O
something O
I've O
never O
seen O
before. O

Okay, O
first O
hall, B-TARGET
but O
there O
are O
tables, O
I O
hope O
they're O
always O
empty... O
like O
a O
store O
with O
ice O
cream O
fridges! O

The O
other O
two O
rooms B-TARGET
are O
normal, O
of O
course O
to O
the O
good O
ones, O
they're O
crawling O
and O
crawling... O
but O
there's O
food!!!!! B-TARGET

I've O
ordered O
eggplants B-TARGET
fried I-TARGET
(in O
sweet O
sauce) O
and O
I've O
got O
a O
lot O
to O
compare O
with... O
I've O
tried O
and O
I'm O
very O
upset. O

I O
didn't O
do O
it, O
I O
drank O
juice, O
I O
was O
afraid O
to O
order. O

The O
size O
of O
the O
dish O
is O
not O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
in O
Chinese O
cuisine, O
taste, O
VCUS!!!! O

Man O
should O
enjoy O
eating, O
not O
think O
all O
night O
about O
what O
sauce O
is O
made O
of!!!! O

I O
really O
want O
to O
think O
that O
people O
were O
writing O
the O
truth, O
and O
I O
just O
didn't O
get O
it, O
but O
I'm O
sorry... O
I'm O
not O
going O
there O
anymore!!!! O

Gentlemen, O
write O
the O
truth! O

P. O

S. O
Only O
one O
review O
was O
true, O
but O
she O
was O
luckier O
than O
me.)) O

Yesterday O
with O
my O
friends, O
I O
decided O
to O
visit O
a O
place B-TARGET
that O
was O
so O
glamorous, O
but O
from O
the O
entrance, O
I O
started O
to O
be O
disappointed. O

As O
soon O
as O
they O
came O
in, O
no O
one O
promised O
to O
meet O
us, O
on O
the O
ground O
floor, O
it O
was O
someone's O
birthday, O
apparently, O
child's O
(although O
I O
don't O
think O
Manilov O
is O
the O
place O
to O
have O
children's O
holidays). O

Then O
we O
went O
up O
to O
the O
second O
floor, O
again O
no O
one O
met O
us, O
and O
the O
restaurant O
hall O
was O
empty, O
only O
some O
company O
that O
allowed O
us O
to O
go. O

After O
10 O
minutes, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
in, O
took O
the O
order, O
ordered O
cocktails, O
pasta, O
and O
a O
Greek O
chicken O
salad. O

The O
order's O
been O
waiting O
a O
long O
time, O
considering O
that O
pasta, O
salad O
at O
most O
half O
an O
hour, O
we've O
been O
waiting O
an O
hour. O

When O
I O
asked O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
there's O
so O
much O
to O
expect O
our O
order, O
and O
the O
answer O
was, O
"Well, O
I O
don't O
know, O
maybe O
in O
10 O
minutes, O
we O
have O
a O
feast O
downstairs O
and O
the O
cooks O
don't O
make O
it... O
" O
which O
I O
said O
wasn't O
justified, O
or O
I O
should O
have O
warned O
you. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
food, O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
nothing, O
average, O
a O
little O
salty, O
the O
Caesar B-TARGET
wasn't O
very, O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
cold O
pieces O
of O
chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
didn't O
inspire O
me O
very O
much. O

Then O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
bill, O
and O
it O
couldn't O
be O
delivered O
for O
as O
long O
as O
it O
was O
ordered. O

I O
don't O
really O
like O
it. O

I O
was O
at O
this O
restaurant O
yesterday! O

I O
didn't O
go O
there O
purposefully, O
so O
I O
didn't O
know O
anything O
about O
this O
place. O

Let's O
start O
at O
the O
entrance! O

There's O
a O
wardrobe B-TARGET
and O
a O
nice O
wardrobeman, B-TARGET
and O
then O
there's O
a O
view O
of O
good O
furniture B-TARGET
and O
a O
nice O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
it's O
sad O
that O
there's O
no O
smoking-free B-TARGET
zone! I-TARGET

They O
met O
normally O
(no O
smile O
on O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
&apos; O
s O
face, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
smile O
on O
the O
manager O
&apos; O
s O
face) O
and O
were O
escorted O
to O
the O
table. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
doesn't O
go O
to O
the O
menu, O
doesn't O
see O
the O
tables, O
everything's O
falling O
out O
of O
hand, O
the O
dirty O
plates O
were O
standing O
on O
the O
table O
for O
10 O
minutes, O
and O
it's O
in O
an O
incomplete O
room!!!!! O

Yeah. O

Kitchen: O
they O
ate O
Japanese B-TARGET
kitchens, I-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
small O
meals, B-TARGET
regular O
serving. B-TARGET

Cesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
is O
also O
delicious! O

I O
heard O
that O
a O
discount O
on O
regular O
guests O
by O
name, O
without O
a O
card, O
they O
don't-- O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
that's O
good! O

We've O
been O
giving O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
a O
smile O
and O
a O
friendly O
look! O

It's O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
sit O
with O
a O
big O
company O
and O
have O
a O
great O
rest. O

A O
couple O
of O
days O
ago, O
they O
went O
in O
there O
with O
their O
friends. O

We O
took O
the O
table, O
and O
five O
minutes O
later, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
took O
the O
order. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
very O
big, O
so O
there's O
something O
to O
spoil O
yourself O
with. O

A O
big O
choice O
of O
desserts! B-TARGET

I O
got O
myself O
a O
tyramisa, B-TARGET
it's O
awesome! O

I've O
only O
tried O
this O
in O
Italy, O
and O
surprisingly O
the O
cake B-TARGET
turns O
out O
to O
be O
soft O
and O
airy, O
and O
you're O
just O
gonna O
lick O
your O
fingers! O

But O
the O
second O
course O
we O
waited O
for O
for O
30 O
minutes O
wasn't O
good, O
but O
it O
was O
worth O
it! O

A O
friend O
ordered O
a O
steak B-TARGET
ribai, I-TARGET
he O
said O
he O
was O
amazing, O
but O
a O
friend O
ordered O
a O
pork B-TARGET
wheel, I-TARGET
she O
was O
dry. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
their O
prices O
are O
acceptable, O
not O
to O
say O
very O
expensive. O

Of O
course, O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
I O
wish O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
could O
work O
faster, O
but O
since O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
we O
tried O
to O
fit O
in. O

All O
in O
all, O
a O
good O
pub B-TARGET
soaked O
in O
football. O

I O
think O
it's O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
noisy O
company O
to O
hang O
out. O

Well, O
I've O
been O
to O
Chaplin O
Hall, O
and O
I'll O
give O
you O
some O
impressions. O

It's B-TARGET
a O
good O
place O
to O
say O
that O
this O
restaurant O
wouldn't O
be O
quite O
right, O
it's O
more O
like O
a O
concert O
hall O
with O
an O
opportunity O
to O
order O
food O
and O
drinks. O

The O
hall B-TARGET
is O
very O
spacious O
and O
atmospheric, O
and O
there's O
plenty O
of O
space B-TARGET
available. O

Nice O
tables B-TARGET
for O
a O
small O
company O
of O
friends O
you O
know. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
quite O
diverse, O
there's O
a O
separate O
menu O
of O
Japanese O
cuisine, O
that's O
for O
an O
amateur. O

I O
prefer O
traditional O
cuisine, O
for O
example. O

There O
are O
mixed O
dishes, O
like O
a O
Russian O
man's O
favorite O
herring O
under O
a O
coat... O
with O
a O
crab. O

I O
didn't O
try O
it, O
it O
just O
caught O
the O
name. O

I O
tried O
a B-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
halibut, I-TARGET
which O
is O
good, O
and O
it O
looks O
beautiful O
on O
a O
plate. O

I O
mean, O
this O
plate O
is O
a O
lot O
bigger O
than O
the O
halibut O
itself. O

I O
guess O
that's O
the O
way O
it's O
supposed O
to O
be. O

Mushroom O
salad's B-TARGET
good, O
too, O
and O
it's O
decent. O

Coffee B-TARGET
dessert, I-TARGET
no O
complaints, O
it's O
delicious. O

It's O
a O
nice O
evening O
with O
a O
good O
company O
in O
a O
good O
place. B-TARGET

I O
loved O
it! O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
arrived O
in O
the O
sky O
at O
about O
7:00 O
p.m. O
on O
February O
9. O

At O
the O
entrance, O
we O
were O
met O
by O
an O
unpleasant O
young B-TARGET
administrative I-TARGET
man. I-TARGET

To O
be O
honest, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
surprised... O

It's O
not O
the O
first O
time O
we've O
come O
to O
this O
restaurant, O
and O
all O
these O
beautiful O
girls O
meet, O
and O
here. O

Come O
on, O
let's O
move O
on. O

There O
weren't O
many O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant O
at O
that O
time O
of O
day. O

And O
we O
had O
a O
huge O
choice O
of O
seats O
ahead O
of O
us. O

We O
were O
offered O
to O
sit O
on O
soft O
and O
comfortable O
couches. B-TARGET

Of O
course O
not O
by O
the O
window, O
but O
the O
view B-TARGET
was O
as O
beautiful O
as O
ever. O

Just O
five O
minutes O
later, O
a O
nice O
waiter B-TARGET
approached O
us O
and O
accepted O
our O
order. O

About O
15 O
minutes O
later, O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
warm B-TARGET
Mexican I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and O
a O
carpaccio B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
duck O
breast. O

Cold B-TARGET
snacks I-TARGET
and O
salad B-TARGET
were O
great! O

The O
hot B-TARGET
one I-TARGET
was O
very O
happy, O
too. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
always O
considerate O
and O
kind. O

I O
always O
showed O
up O
at O
the O
right O
moment. O

I O
wasn't O
bored, O
and O
I O
didn't O
leave O
us O
all O
alone. O

Everything O
was O
fine! O

We O
really O
liked O
it. O

We'll O
come O
again O
and O
again O
many O
times. O

When O
this O
restaurant O
opened O
right O
next O
to O
the O
house, O
I O
was O
very O
happy, O
because O
Patio O
was O
in O
Nevsk, O
and O
so O
was O
Planet O
Sushi. O

When O
it O
was O
time O
to O
choose O
the O
place O
to O
celebrate O
the O
birthday, O
you O
didn't O
have O
to O
think O
for O
long. O

We O
came... O
we O
met O
well, O
we O
sat O
at O
a O
nice O
table B-TARGET
in O
the O
corner... O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
brought O
the O
menu O
and... O
went O
missing, O
20 O
minutes O
later, O
the O
friends O
were O
ready O
to O
go O
to O
the O
kitchen O
themselves O
for O
food... O

Our O
order O
was O
finally O
accepted, O
instead O
of O
the O
freshly O
made O
juice, O
it O
was O
brought O
from O
a O
box, O
a O
martini O
with O
ice, O
but O
no O
pints O
(seeing O
the O
previous O
comment, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
it's O
probably O
the O
way O
it O
is)..... O

Different O
waiters B-TARGET
came O
to O
the O
table O
all O
the O
time, O
maybe O
3 O
or O
4... O
who O
would O
pay O
the O
tip???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? O

There O
was O
a O
scream O
and O
a O
weird O
crack O
in O
the O
kitchen... O

When O
the O
bill O
was O
brought O
in, O
it O
wasn't O
about O
the O
chauffeurs, O
but O
it O
never O
came O
back O
to O
us O
(it's O
probably O
the O
norm, O
too) O
and O
it O
wasn't O
a O
small O
one, O
it O
wasn't O
10% O
of O
the O
order. O

A O
big O
restaurant, B-TARGET
a O
good O
and O
important O
place B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
decent O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired... O

We O
went O
to O
this O
place O
on O
my O
dad's O
anniversary. O

The O
choice O
fell O
on O
him, O
so O
they O
lived O
nearby, O
and O
the O
guests O
came O
from O
another O
town, O
so O
they O
didn't O
want O
to O
go O
anywhere O
in O
the O
city's O
cathedral. O

So O
let's O
start O
with O
the O
interior. O

For O
this O
area, O
it's O
a O
location O
where O
there's O
no O
decent O
place O
in O
principle. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
nice. O

And O
they O
met O
us O
and O
they O
led O
us O
to O
the O
table, O
and O
what O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
she O
was, O
just O
a O
miracle, O
nice, O
thoughtful, O
but O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
was O
that O
she O
wasn't O
too O
much, O
but O
she O
was O
doing O
her O
job O
at O
100 O
percent, O
maybe O
200 O
percent. O

Let's O
go O
to O
the O
kitchen. O

You O
ordered O
a O
lot, O
you O
understand O
the O
anniversary. O

But, O
oh, O
awful, O
there O
was O
a O
shock. O

Yeah, O
the O
first O
view O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
great, O
design, O
some O
cook's O
find. O

But O
it O
tastes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

No, O
it's O
not O
that O
it O
was O
disgusting, O
but O
none O
of O
it O
was O
good O
enough. O

The O
meat's B-TARGET
dry, O
the O
fish's B-TARGET
not O
salty, O
which O
you O
can't O
tell O
me O
about O
the O
drinks. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
card I-TARGET
is O
beautiful. O

The O
quality O
of O
wine B-TARGET
was O
also O
good. O

Anyway, O
if O
you're O
going O
there O
purposefully, O
you're O
better O
off, O
and O
if O
you're O
just O
passing O
by O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
in O
just O
to O
be O
curious, O
you O
can. O

But O
I'm O
afraid O
the O
comments O
after O
that O
aren't O
gonna O
be O
the O
best. O

A O
friend O
very O
much O
recommended O
this O
place. B-TARGET

And O
since O
it's O
well-placed O
in O
one O
of O
the O
favorite O
parts B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
town, I-TARGET
I O
got O
to O
it O
quickly. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
liked O
it, O
the O
people O
weren't O
very O
much, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
careful, O
the O
order O
came O
quickly. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
struck O
me: O
a O
lot O
of O
interesting O
desserts, B-TARGET
a O
huge O
choice O
of O
alcoholic B-TARGET
cocktails... I-TARGET
true, O
prices O
are O
far O
from O
low, O
especially O
on O
hot B-TARGET
and O
salads. B-TARGET

It's O
probably O
called O
a O
little O
higher O
than O
average. O

But O
in O
the O
next O
few O
times, O
I O
was O
disappointed, O
there's B-TARGET
almost O
no O
space O
available, O
waiters B-TARGET
don't O
make O
it, O
desserts B-TARGET
don't O
make O
it... O

But, O
anyway, O
I O
like O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
this O
place. O

And O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
amazing. O

By O
the O
way, O
last O
time O
I O
ate O
pasta B-TARGET
four I-TARGET
cheeses I-TARGET
and O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
taste O
and O
size O
of O
the O
meal) O

I've O
never O
taken O
this O
place O
seriously, O
even O
though O
I've O
been O
there O
a O
lot... O

But... O
if O
I O
used O
to O
go O
in O
there O
for O
a O
drink, O
you O
know), O
or O
have O
a O
quick O
snack, O
it O
wasn't O
long O
ago O
that O
I O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
full O
dinner O
there. O

I'll O
tell O
you, O
the O
impressions O
are O
positive, O
not O
without O
the O
chickens, O
but... O
nevertheless, O
they're O
satisfied. O

We O
met O
mentally, O
there O
was O
no O
complaint, O
and O
there O
was O
never, O
there O
wasn't O
a O
table, O
there O
was O
a O
minus.) O
) O

It O
was O
tonight, O
so O
the O
candles B-TARGET
were O
lit, O
the O
lights O
were O
cut O
down, O
and... O
gentlemen O
and O
ladies, O
I'll O
tell O
you O
what's O
so O
cozy O
that O
I O
never O
thought O
this O
place B-TARGET
in O
daylight O
looked O
like O
a O
cafe. O

Anyway, O
the O
muffled B-TARGET
light, I-TARGET
the O
quiet O
music, B-TARGET
the O
nice O
and O
caring O
staff B-TARGET
-- O
they O
did O
their O
thing O
-- O
they O
made O
them O
relax.) O

I'm O
not O
gonna O
talk O
much O
about O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
it's O
all O
right. O

"Caprese", B-TARGET
medallions, B-TARGET
"Cesar", B-TARGET
"Cesar", I-TARGET
"Certain B-TARGET
roll", I-TARGET
did O
not O
make O
much O
excitement, O
but O
neither O
did O
they, O
which O
is O
no O
longer O
bad, O
but O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(I O
repeat) O
made O
an O
incredible O
impression. O

I O
recommend, O
especially O
those O
who O
were O
there O
during O
the O
day, O
come O
by O
tonight, O
believe O
me, O
you're O
going O
to O
go O
to O
a O
completely O
different O
establishment. B-TARGET

Special O
thanks O
to O
Irina O
for O
her O
thoughtful O
and O
polite O
service. B-TARGET

I've O
decided O
one O
thing O
for O
myself, O
I'll O
come O
back O
again O
and O
again. O

Thank O
you! O

She O
was O
in O
three O
different O
restaurants O
at O
Mama O
Roma. O

The O
kitchen's B-TARGET
happy, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
isn't O
very O
good. O

Whether O
they're O
prepared O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
whether O
they're O
carried O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
even O
though O
the O
people O
weren't O
doing O
it O
twice-- O
it O
seems O
like... O

One O
time, O
it O
felt O
like O
we'd O
been O
forgotten. O

But O
worse, O
there's O
always O
nothing O
on O
the O
menu, O
and, O
like, O
it's O
just O
what O
I O
want O
to O
try! O

The O
choice O
of O
desserts B-TARGET
turns O
out O
to O
be O
small O
at O
all. O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
I O
recommend. O

But O
pizza B-TARGET
isn't O
a O
fountain. O
It's O
just O
a O
regular O
pizza. O
It's O
nothing. O

It's O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
it O
takes. O

Last O
Saturday, O
they O
visited O
this O
place O
with O
friends. O

It O
didn't O
start O
with O
very O
nice O
moments, O
because O
when O
we O
got O
there, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
there O
were O
no O
tables O
available, O
and O
it O
wasn't O
until O
about O
20 O
minutes O
later O
that O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
found O
us O
the O
right O
table. O

In O
general, O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
enjoyed O
both O
the O
environment B-TARGET
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
and O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

On O
the O
plus O
side, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
enough O
despite O
the O
huge O
number O
of O
people, O
the O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(the O
DJs O
played) O
for O
Saturday O
night, O
the O
choice O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
alcoholic B-TARGET
drinks I-TARGET
(although O
we O
never O
ate, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
to O
drink). O

Minus: O
It O
seemed O
like O
music B-TARGET
was O
playing O
too O
loud; O
there O
was O
no O
lighting B-TARGET
above I-TARGET
the O
table O
(although O
there O
was O
still O
light O
over O
some O
other O
light), O
which O
made O
it O
necessary O
to O
light O
the O
menu O
with O
a O
telephone, O
and O
probably O
the O
main O
minus O
for O
me O
is O
that O
there O
was O
no O
room O
for O
a O
wardrobe B-TARGET
in O
such O
a O
big O
place, I-TARGET
so O
our O
jackets O
were O
constantly O
falling O
on O
the O
floor O
from O
the O
couch. O

We've O
been O
asked O
to O
deposit B-TARGET
$5,000 O
at O
our O
table, O
but O
for O
a O
big O
company, O
it's O
not O
that O
much, O
for O
example, O
we've O
left O
8,000. O

But O
despite O
all O
the O
downsides, O
we've O
been O
quite O
satisfied O
with O
this O
place, B-TARGET
and O
I O
think O
we'll O
visit O
again. O

Well, O
that's O
a O
nice O
little O
thing O
at O
the O
end, O
asking O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
for O
a O
discount O
card, O
and O
he O
gave O
it O
to O
us. O

So O
there's O
gonna O
be O
an O
extra O
reason O
to O
come O
in O
and O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
discount) O

We've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
twice. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleased, O
the O
tablecloths O
are O
changed O
after O
every O
visitor, O
all O
very O
clean. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
trained, O
they O
can O
tell O
you O
what O
they're O
doing, O
what O
they're O
doing. O

The O
rates B-TARGET
are O
big O
enough. O

It's O
delicious! O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
on O
holidays O
and O
weekends, O
they O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
visitors, O
though O
it O
shows O
that O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
good... O

And O
that's O
why O
they O
cook O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time! O

The O
snacks O
and O
salads O
come O
quickly, O
and O
the O
hot O
ones O
have O
to O
wait. O

They O
brought O
us O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
for O
waiting, O
ice O
cream O
for O
the O
baby. O

By O
the O
way, O
they O
make O
the O
ice B-TARGET
cream O
themselves! O

It's O
delicious! O

Hello. O

I O
was O
in O
this O
BARE O
28.10.09, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
isn't O
special, O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
expensive O
enough, O
and O
then O
the O
beer O
"Beresta B-TARGET
Light" I-TARGET
220r O
didn't O
really O
like O
it, O
but O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
snacks B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
the O
beer, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
point O
out O
that O
they O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
choice O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
meat, O
which O
is O
very O
important O
to O
me O
personally. O

This O
bar O
fits O
those O
who O
want O
to O
watch O
football, O
drink O
beer O
precisely O
because O
to O
drink O
other O
drinks, O
I O
wouldn't O
recommend O
this O
place O
because O
alcohol O
is O
more O
expensive O
here O
than O
some O
restaurants O
where O
you'll O
find O
better O
quality O
service, O
live O
music, O
and O
a O
larger O
set O
of O
meals O
that O
fit O
in O
to O
drink O
strong O
drinks O
is O
very O
appropriate O
for O
those O
who O
just O
want O
to O
talk O
in O
a O
quiet O
environment. O

I O
was O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
my O
friends O
the O
other O
day, O
and O
I O
really O
liked O
it. O

We O
met, O
we O
offered O
to O
pick O
a O
table, O
people O
were O
a O
little O
bit, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
nice. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
came O
right O
up O
with O
dark O
hair, O
unfortunately O
the O
name O
didn't O
ring, O
the O
restaurant O
service B-TARGET
was O
great, O
there's O
nothing O
to O
say! O

When O
I O
asked O
you O
to O
help O
me O
pick O
out O
a O
dish, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
was O
happy O
to O
offer O
us O
a O
couple O
of O
salads O
and O
a O
hot O
one, O
cooked O
everything O
very O
quickly, O
and O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

I'm O
really O
glad O
I O
came O
here, O
though O
it's O
a O
little O
far O
away, O
but O
I've O
never O
regretted O
it, O
and O
I'm O
gonna O
advise O
all O
my O
friends O
about O
this O
place. B-TARGET

Good O
time O
to O
you!!!! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
a O
big O
roll B-TARGET
that O
can't O
even O
fit O
in O
your O
mouth, O
you're O
here. O

There's O
a O
lovely O
roll, B-TARGET
and O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
European B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

I O
haven't O
seen O
a O
roll B-TARGET
like O
that O
in O
this O
cafe O
anywhere O
else, O
I O
drive O
here O
from O
the O
other O
side O
of O
town O
on O
purpose, O
but O
that O
makes O
sense, O
the O
whole O
place B-TARGET
isn't O
bad O
about O
a O
year O
or O
so O
ago O
without O
a O
table, O
and O
it's O
even O
on O
Sundays, O
now O
there's O
almost O
always O
room, O
and O
in O
the O
summer O
there's O
also O
veranda's B-TARGET
help. O

At O
prices, O
I O
can O
say O
that O
if O
you O
eat O
and O
rolls O
and O
some O
other O
dish, O
dessert, O
cold O
drinks, O
you O
make O
1450-1750r O
per O
person, O
but O
so O
much O
food B-TARGET
not O
everyone O
can O
eat, O
so O
you O
can O
inject O
yourself O
into O
a O
big O
appetite, O
so O
maybe O
750 O
p. O
is O
enough. O

I've O
been O
visiting O
this O
place B-TARGET
for O
two O
years O
now, O
the O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
services B-TARGET
hasn't O
changed, O
and O
it's O
a O
sign O
of O
professionalism. O

There O
were O
several O
times O
at O
this O
restaurant O
and O
the O
impressions O
are: O
(1) O

Food. O

The O
same O
food B-TARGET
as O
many O
other O
Chinese O
restaurants O
(that O
fish, B-TARGET
that O
meat B-TARGET
is O
all O
the O
same, O
all O
the O
same O
sauce), B-TARGET
is O
all O
edible, O
but O
not O
very O
tasty. O

From O
the O
desserts, O
I O
really O
liked O
the B-TARGET
gorganzall I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
ice O
cream O
(but O
it's O
certainly O
not O
their O
cooking). O
2) O

Service. O

It O
depends O
on O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
there's O
the O
nice O
ones, O
there's O
the O
bad O
ones. O

The O
situation. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
pretty O
poor, O
there's O
some O
linolium B-TARGET
on O
the O
floor. O

The O
music B-TARGET
is O
too O
loud O
and O
obsessive. O

Russian B-TARGET
radio I-TARGET
is O
playing, O
and O
it's O
awful! O

On O
the O
plus O
side, O
there's O
always O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
this O
place, B-TARGET
there's O
always O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
available. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
first O
impressions O
great, O
but O
the O
truth O
is O
I O
didn't O
like O
it O
right O
away O
is O
that O
we O
had O
a O
table O
booked O
by O
the O
window, O
but O
we O
were O
put O
in O
the O
worst O
place! O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
nice, O
not O
obsessive, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
great! O

As O
for O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
honestly, O
I O
didn't O
like O
it. O

The O
meat O
was O
waiting O
for O
minutes O
30, O
if O
not O
more... O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
low, O
the O
staff's B-TARGET
too, O
but O
the O
kitchen's B-TARGET
not O
good. O

I O
was O
with O
four O
of O
my O
friends O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

What O
can O
I O
say: O
1. O

I O
liked O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice, O
social O
and O
kind, O
at O
our O
request, O
photographed O
us O
without O
problem, O
brought O
food O
fast, O
extra O
plates O
didn't O
stay O
on O
the O
table O
either. O

In O
the O
wardrobe, O
the O
uncle B-TARGET
is O
also O
very O
polite, O
and O
everyone O
else O
has O
seen O
the O
staff B-TARGET
make O
a O
pleasant O
impression. O
2. O

It O
was O
Sunday O
at O
3:30 O
p.m., O
nobody O
was O
there, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
surprised, O
and O
then O
there O
were O
people O
coming. O

The O
big O
room, B-TARGET
the O
furniture B-TARGET
is O
decent, O
the O
big O
TV B-TARGET
on O
the O
wall O
is O
convenient O
to O
watch O
from O
any O
table, O
maybe O
3. O

They O
wanted O
to O
order O
Czech B-TARGET
drinks I-TARGET
at O
first, O
but O
they O
weren't, O
unfortunately, O
a O
little O
upset, O
but O
not O
much. O

They O
ordered O
whiskey. O
It's O
okay. O
It's O
okay. O
It's O
okay. O

They O
also O
ordered O
meat O
assortments, O
and O
cabbage O
and O
meat. O

There's O
no O
claim O
for O
quality. B-TARGET

It's O
no O
big O
deal, O
but O
it's O
no O
big O
deal. O

In O
general, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
gave O
a O
pleasant O
impression. O

About O
a O
month O
ago, O
many O
people O
recommended O
it O
as O
a O
wonderful O
place. B-TARGET

Yeah, O
really, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
really O
nice, O
nice. O

Like O
most O
of O
the O
acquaintances O
who O
visited O
the O
site, B-TARGET
the O
interior B-TARGET
enjoyed O
it, O
and O
it O
has O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
friendly, O
warm O
communication. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
responsive. O

Food's B-TARGET
on O
the O
level, O
and O
that's O
what O
made-- O
big O
meals) B-TARGET

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
minuses O
of O
this O
restaurant, O
it's O
very O
public, O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
there O
tonight, O
make O
sure O
you O
order O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

Visited O
October O
15th. O

We O
celebrated O
the O
wedding O
for O
two. O

We're O
in O
total O
delight. O

Indeed, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
good O
one. O

It's O
particularly O
surprising O
for O
a O
sleeping O
area. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
impressive, O
very O
kind, O
beautiful, O
stylish. O

The O
tables, B-TARGET
which O
are O
particularly O
liked, O
set O
apart, O
don't O
bother, O
can't O
be O
seen, O
can't O
hear, O
create O
some O
kind O
of O
secluded O
comfort. O

It's O
a O
great O
service! B-TARGET

There O
were O
two O
waiters, O
our O
table O
was O
served O
by O
a O
young O
man O
by O
his O
name. O

Artem, O
Marat?) O
Excuse O
me, O
have O
you O
forgotten O
the O
name O
of O
time:) O

But O
he O
served O
in O
the O
highest O
class: O
warning, O
correct, O
non-addictive. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
at O
a O
height: O
salads B-TARGET
are O
unusual, O
tasty, O
and O
meals B-TARGET
are O
very O
decent O
in O
size. O

It's O
hot. B-TARGET
It's O
awesome. O

The O
veal O
medallions B-TARGET
are O
amazing, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
melts O
in O
the O
mouth, O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

The O
duck B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
orange O
sauce O
was O
also O
very O
good. O

Dessert, B-TARGET
cream B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
fruit I-TARGET
biscuits, I-TARGET
too, O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
good, O
although O
at O
the O
very O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
- O
tired O
of O
eating:) O

The O
result O
is: O
2 O
glasses O
of O

Thank O
you. O

Everybody's O
recommended. O

I O
visited O
Terrace O
the O
other O
day, O
which O
hasn't O
been O
in O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
months. O

I O
miss O
you!) O

A O
small O
women's O
company O
came O
in O
at O
nine O
o'clock. O

At O
that O
time, O
the O
people O
gathered O
very O
glamorous, O
all O
around O
them O
with O
brands O
and O
jewels. O

I O
like O
the O
stylish O
glamour O
(I O
don't O
know O
if O
that O
expression O
is O
used) O
rather O
than... O
pink. O

I O
mean, O
there O
were O
two O
ladies O
sitting O
in O
pink O
at O
the O
next O
table. O

They're O
very O
funny, O
they're O
having O
fun.) O

At O
11:00 O
a.m., O
three O
young O
people O
came O
to O
meet O
us. O

We O
didn't O
get O
to O
know O
each O
other, O
but O
luckily O
they O
didn't O
ruin O
our O
mood. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
got O
a O
good O
one: O
careful, O
unappreciative, O
and O
she O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
hours. O

The O
services B-TARGET
in O
Terrace O
aren't O
bad, O
but O
once O
they O
don't O
have O
to. O

Lucky O
this O
time. O

Kitchen, B-TARGET
as O
always, O
at O
the O
level. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
interesting O
and O
varied. O

Salats B-TARGET
and O
pasta B-TARGET
are O
amazing. O

Alcohol B-TARGET
is O
really O
good.) O

Prices O
are O
acceptable. O

In O
general, O
Terrasa B-TARGET
is O
not O
disappointed O
and O
continues O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
favorite O
places. O

Today, O
a O
friend O
visited O
the O
establishment. O
It O
was O
very O
nice, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
happy O
at O
the O
entrance, O
the O
friendly O
and O
smiling O
administrator B-TARGET
of O
Catherine O
met O
us O
and O
put O
us O
at O
a O
very O
nice O
table, B-TARGET
where O
a O
great O
view B-TARGET
was O
opened. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
waitress. B-TARGET

They O
ordered O
the O
foundation, B-TARGET
served O
us O
very O
quickly, O
and O
it O
didn't O
have O
any O
effect O
on O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
meal. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
and O
all O
the O
maintenance B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
very O
good O
at O
what O
they're O
doing. O

Good O
job. O

From O
now O
on, O
"Cherd B-TARGET
of O
the O
Artist" O
will O
be O
a O
frequent O
place O
in O
our O
city. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
good O
mood O
for O
the O
day!!!! O

I O
want O
to O
leave O
my O
review O
of O
this O
wonderful O
cafe. B-TARGET

We O
celebrated O
Mom's O
anniversary, O
everything O
was O
great! O

There's O
no O
disgruntled O
ones O
left, O
everyone O
really O
liked O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

Big O
meals, B-TARGET
interesting O
salads B-TARGET
and O
hot B-TARGET
ones, I-TARGET
everything O
was O
very O
good O
and O
delicious O
for O
a O
relatively O
small O
price! O

A O
very O
pleasant O
non-addictive O
service! B-TARGET

Special O
thanks O
to O
Administrator B-TARGET
Sergei! O

There's O
only O
good O
memories O
left! O

And O
what O
a O
lovely O
cake B-TARGET
it O
was! O

I O
recommend O
you O
all O
go O
to O
this O
wonderful O
cafe! B-TARGET

It's O
perfect O
for O
a O
small O
party! O

It's O
cozy O
and O
homey! O

They O
celebrated O
their O
husband's O
birthday O
in O
Karawan O
- O
Sarai. O

At O
first, O
the O
party O
was O
planned O
elsewhere, O
but O
the O
tables O
weren't O
available, O
so O
the O
will O
of O
the O
court O
ended O
up O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
it's O
not O
big, O
but O
it's O
very O
cozy. O

We've O
booked O
a O
table O
behind O
the O
window O
screen O
so O
no O
one O
gets O
in O
the O
way. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
note O
separately O
the O
waiter's B-TARGET
work O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
maintenance. B-TARGET

Everything O
was O
done O
quickly, O
qualitatively, O
and O
the O
main O
thing O
was O
invisible!!!!!! O
I O
spilled O
the O
wine O
once O
after O
all. O

They O
decided O
to O
order O
a O
large O
plate O
of O
cabobas, O
in O
addition O
to O
standard O
dishes. O

It's O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half, O
but O
it's O
delicious! O

In O
fact, O
all O
the O
cat O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
were O
made O
of O
fresh O
quality O
products. B-TARGET
So O
to O
sum O
up, O
I'm O
going O
to O
say O
that O
it's O
really O
good O
to O
eat O
there, O
but O
when O
you O
pay O
the O
bill, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
just O
didn't O
bring O
the O
change O
back!!!!!!!!! O

Guess O
he O
figured O
1,000 O
rubles O
of O
surrender O
we O
decided O
to O
keep O
him O
for O
tea! O

And O
even O
when O
they O
tried O
to O
get O
him O
to O
pack O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dishes O
with O
us, O
the O
lunk O
just O
turned O
around O
and O
went O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
room. O

I O
guess O
I O
was O
afraid O
we'd O
start O
taking O
the O
money O
:) O

I O
don't O
think O
it's O
pretty. O

We O
usually O
go O
there O
for O
dinner O
after O
working O
with O
our O
husband. O

I O
really O
like O
the O
calm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
quiet O
background O
music B-TARGET
doesn't O
stop O
the O
conversation, O
there's O
always O
a O
free O
table. B-TARGET

I O
don't O
really O
understand O
people O
who O
complain O
about O
it. O

I'm O
much O
more O
comfortable O
and O
comfortable O
eating O
in O
a O
place O
where O
people O
don't O
crowd, O
there's O
no O
noise, O
there's O
no O
running. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
likes O
it O
very O
much, O
too, O
if O
you O
take O
Japanese O
food O
in O
Petersburg. O

Very O
acceptable, O
at O
more O
than O
acceptable O
prices. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
aren't O
afraid. O

Sure, O
I'd O
like O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
rolls, B-TARGET
but O
the O
ones O
you O
have O
really O
like. O

Soups B-TARGET
are O
great O
all O
the O
time! O

And O
very O
good O
fresh-pressed B-TARGET
juices. I-TARGET

There O
is O
now O
a O
small O
European O
menu. O

It's O
not O
bad O
either. O

The B-TARGET
bacon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
bacon I-TARGET
dragons I-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
and O
they're O
really O
male. O

With O
service, B-TARGET
we're O
lucky. O

Once, O
they O
hit O
an O
untrained O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
wasn't O
happy O
but O
never O
saw O
her O
again. O

They O
usually O
do O
things O
fast, O
pay O
attention, O
warn O
if O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
something O
on O
the O
menu. O

For O
the O
first O
time, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
a O
discount O
card. O

The O
discounts O
are O
always O
granted O
even O
if O
the O
cards O
are O
not O
with O
them O
(they O
are O
found O
by O
name). O

In O
general, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
satisfied, O
unobtrusive, O
but O
careful. O

It's O
the O
only O
place B-TARGET
in O
Petersburg O
where O
I O
eat O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
in O
peace, O
despite O
the O
pregnancy. O

In O
the O
remaining O
places, O
I'm O
afraid)) O

No, O
the O
avatar O
doesn't O
have O
a O
picture O
of O
the O
bartender. O

I O
can't O
see O
him O
from O
the O
street, O
and O
the B-TARGET
sign I-TARGET
doesn't O
really O
know O
how O
to O
go O
inside... O
so O
I O
wouldn't O
come O
in, O
honestly. O

But O
my O
friends O
did, O
and O
I O
didn't O
regret O
it! O
There's O
not O
much O
space, O
I O
don't O
know, O
plus O
it O
or O
minus O
five O
or O
six O
tables, B-TARGET
well, O
the O
bar B-TARGET
bar O
is O
very O
cozy) O
the O
coolest O
table B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
room, O
in O
the O
corner, O
with O
the O
couch B-TARGET
and O
the O
pillows B-TARGET
) O

I O
liked O
the O
interior. B-TARGET
Light O
tones, O
paintings, B-TARGET
bead B-TARGET
curtains, I-TARGET
or O
whatever. O

A O
menu. O

The B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
card I-TARGET
is O
good. O
There's O
a O
lot O
to O
choose O
from. O

The O
choice O
of O
food B-TARGET
is O
small. O
I've O
ordered O
a O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fruit I-TARGET
and O
salad. B-TARGET
(I O
honestly O
don't O
remember O
the O
name.) O

I'm O
going O
to O
wait O
at O
least O
15 O
minutes, O
and O
since O
the O
bartender O
is O
one O
and O
the O
drinks O
are O
brought O
to O
everyone O
as O
they're O
cooked... O
and O
here's O
the O
plus O
bar. O

Service! B-TARGET
More O
like O
the O
barman's B-TARGET
attitude O
to O
the O
visitors. O
He'll O
meet O
everyone. O
He'll O
do O
great. O

It's O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
sit O
with O
your O
friends O
tonight, O
and O
it's O
all O
right O
to O
come, O
one O
or O
two, O
too! O
Sit O
down O
at O
the B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
and O
have O
a O
warm O
conversation O
with O
a O
nice O
bartender. B-TARGET

At O
this O
restaurant, O
we O
celebrated O
the O
tenth O
anniversary O
of O
the O
wedding. O

Our O
guests O
and O
I O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
calm, O
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

I O
especially O
enjoyed O
how O
tasty O
dessert B-TARGET
tiramisu I-TARGET
was O
made. O

I O
haven't O
eaten O
this O
delicious O
dessert B-TARGET
in O
a O
restaurant. O

We O
left O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
and O
rested. O

My O
husband's O
birthday O
is O
coming O
up O
and O
we're O
gonna O
celebrate O
it O
here. O

A O
week O
ago, O
they O
came O
to O
see O
the O
new O
place. O

The O
table O
was O
booked, O
but O
we O
could've O
never O
ordered O
it, O
and O
the O
tables O
were O
empty. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
two O
rooms O
and O
a O
karaoke O
room O
(she O
can't O
see, O
doesn't O
work O
every O
day). O

We O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
in O
our O
room-- O
cozy, O
beautiful O
furniture. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
isn't O
very O
big, O
the O
prices O
are O
midlife. O

The O
absence O
of O
some O
ordered O
salads O
was O
explained O
to O
us O
by O
the O
high O
demand:-) O

A O
bit O
surprised O
by O
the O
huge O
number O
of O
service B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
in O
square O
metres O
and O
the O
visitor, O
our O
desk O
was O
served O
by O
two, O
even O
though O
there O
were O
only O
five O
of O
us O
at O
the O
table. O

There's O
staff B-TARGET
in O
the O
halls O
all O
the O
time, O
there's O
a O
few O
"meeters" O
outside O
the O
door. O

Apparently O
the O
administration O
isn't O
feeling O
the O
crisis O
yet... O

There O
were O
no O
claims O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
salads, B-TARGET
but O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
weren't O
impressed, O
so O
we O
didn't O
think O
they O
were O
preparing O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

I O
guess O
I'll O
have O
to O
come O
in O
again O
to O
see O
the O
dynamics O
of O
development... O

For O
the O
first O
time, O
they O
looked O
into O
the O
waterfront B-TARGET
and O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
evening!!!! O
there O
was O
not O
a O
single O
negative O
moment O
that O
rarely O
happened!) O

It's O
a O
big O
restaurant!... B-TARGET
but O
it's O
a O
very O
cozy O
and O
really O
multiply O
place! O

I O
don't O
think O
even O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
who O
don't O
feel O
like O
herrings O
in O
a O
barrel O
(we O
were O
on O
Tuesday, O
it O
was O
quite O
spacious). O

The O
local O
beer B-TARGET
liked O
it O
right O
away.)) O

We've O
tried O
most O
of O
them! O

Raspberry B-TARGET
"Pharmacist" I-TARGET
is O
very O
original! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
great! O
In O
time, O
the O
drinks O
are O
almost O
instant! O

It O
was O
really O
nice O
talking O
to O
her, O
thank O
you! O

The O
salads B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
the O
pork B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Feta I-TARGET
cheese, I-TARGET
the O
pistons O
and O
the O
mushroom O
sauce O
are O
a O
delight!!! O

Seafood B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
in O
parchment O
- O
very O
original, O
gorgeous O
tomato B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
thin O
taste, O
timian B-TARGET
twigs O
- O
very O
spicy! O

I O
mean, O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
original O
food B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu, O
and O
it's O
definitely O
worth O
going O
to O
the O
waterfront B-TARGET
to O
get O
fresh O
cooking O
impressions! O

We'll O
definitely O
go O
there O
again, O
and O
we'll O
certainly O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
our O
friends! O

Yeah, O
it's O
something O
I O
can't O
even O
tell O
you O
how, O
but O
I'll O
try. O

I'm O
going O
to O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
fairy O
tale, O
fairy O
tale! O

We O
met O
with O
a O
smile. O

Nice O
to O
meet O
you. O

They O
showed O
me O
a O
table O
for O
two, O
and O
I O
was. O

It's O
okay, O
I O
like O
to O
walk O
alone. O

A O
nice O
girl B-TARGET
brought O
a O
menu. O

A B-TARGET
good, O
modest O
menu. O

I'm O
sitting O
here, O
I O
think O
I'm O
gonna O
choose O
on O
such O
a O
hungry O
stomach. O

Here's O
what O
I O
wanted: O
beef O
cutter O
salad O
(290r), O
meat O
soup O
(210p), O
ovine O
cara O
(680p). O

On O
the O
order, O
I O
was O
gonna O
take O
the O
juice, O
the O
girl O
advised O
the O
natural O
morse, O
I O
said O
yes. O

Mmm, O
what O
a O
great O
salad! B-TARGET

I've O
never O
tried O
one O
like O
this O
before. O

And O
the O
soup B-TARGET
is O
even O
better. O

Very O
unusual. O

I'm B-TARGET
gonna O
be O
the O
mutton, O
I'm O
gonna O
be O
the O
lamb O
one O
more O
time. O

Until O
I O
burst, O
I O
guess O
I'll O
have O
enough. O

Yeah, O
thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
cook. B-TARGET

Way O
to O
go! O

It O
was O
delicious! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
it's O
tasteful. O

The O
color, B-TARGET
the O
gamma, B-TARGET
and O
the O
chairs B-TARGET
are O
all O
beautiful O
and O
convenient. O

It's O
like O
a O
kingdom. O

It's O
better O
to O
come O
here O
with O
a O
loved O
one O
for O
dinner. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good. O

There's O
a O
few O
downsides, O
but O
I O
think O
they're O
gonna O
get O
away O
with O
it. O

Eight, O
but O
I'm O
gonna O
be O
nine. O

Because O
you O
can O
see O
that O
people O
are O
looking O
for O
the O
best. O

I'll O
make O
sure O
to O
come O
again. O

Three O
days O
ago, O
it O
was O
a O
birthday O
party O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Tonight O
I O
decided O
to O
read O
the O
reviews O
of O
this O
institution B-TARGET
because O
the O
evening O
was O
just O
ruined. O

It O
seems O
like O
we O
were O
somewhere O
else. O

Yeah, O
not O
a O
bad O
interior, B-TARGET
not O
a O
bad O
kitchen... B-TARGET
but O
everything O
else O
is O
awful. O

First O
of O
all, O
I O
haven't O
seen O
such O
a O
disgusting O
service B-TARGET
anywhere. O

There O
was O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
working O
for O
the O
whole O
restaurant, O
which O
is O
weird. O

If O
she O
hadn't O
been O
able O
to O
handle O
a O
lot O
of O
orders, O
it's O
kind O
of O
apologizing, O
but O
she O
wasn't O
trying O
too O
hard. O

For O
example, O
we O
had O
20 O
minutes O
of O
wine, O
we O
went O
out O
to O
smoke, O
where O
there O
were O
chairs O
and O
a O
table, O
and O
they O
asked O
her O
to O
bring O
an O
ashtray... O
she O
promised, O
but O
she O
didn't O
do O
it O
until O
the O
end O
of O
our O
dinner. O

We O
ordered O
olives O
for O
a O
snack, O
among O
other O
things, O
so O
they O
brought O
them O
to O
us O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
and O
she O
forgot O
about O
one O
order O
at O
all, O
which O
she O
just O
apologized O
for. O

A O
separate O
story O
is O
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

A O
good O
singer O
with O
a O
good O
voice... O
but O
for O
such O
a O
small O
room, B-TARGET
it's O
just O
a O
quiet O
horror. O

Not O
only O
was O
it O
impossible O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
table, O
but O
the O
neighbors O
on O
the O
right O
left O
had O
to O
ask O
again. O

I O
agree, O
there's O
no O
comrade's O
taste O
or O
colour, O
but O
I'm O
not O
gonna O
be O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
anymore O
and O
I'm O
gonna O
give O
all O
my O
friends O
a O
heads-up. O

It's O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
with O
a O
great O
kitchen. B-TARGET

I O
read O
a O
lot O
of O
reviews, O
and O
to O
be O
honest, O
more O
than O
half O
of O
them O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
lies. O

Someone O
wrote O
about O
the O
fridge O
salads O
and O
not O
a O
tasty O
lava. O

It's O
not O
true. O

The O
salads B-TARGET
are O
fresh, O
the O
ingredients O
are O
clearly O
not O
from O
the O
ribbon O
and O
the O
refrigerator. O

Lavash B-TARGET
is O
fresh, O
we O
ate O
it O
right O
away. O
We O
haven't O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
get O
a O
salad O
yet. O

Someone O
said O
meat's O
been O
cooked O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

Yeah, O
it's O
not O
in O
ten O
minutes, O
but O
they O
say O
we O
have O
to O
wait O
40 O
minutes. O

It's B-TARGET
fresh, O
it's O
melting, O
no O
fat O
and O
no O
bones. O

The O
machines B-TARGET
aren't O
the O
only O
ones. O

Of O
the O
negatives O
(it's O
not O
minus O
for O
me), O
there's O
no O
separate O
smoking B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
and O
maybe O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
pissed O
off O
(although O
I O
think O
it's O
perfect O
for O
me). O

The O
glasses O
are O
always O
full O
and O
don't O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
few O
minutes O
to O
get O
to O
you. O

Poisons B-TARGET
are O
perfectly O
normal, O
not O
huge, O
but O
not O
small. O

And O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
prices. O

It's O
cheap O
and O
delicious. O

How O
much O
we O
ate O
and O
drank O
for O
six O
people O
would O
simply O
be O
two O
or O
three O
times O
more O
expensive O
in O
other O
institutions. O

Satisfied O
and O
full O
have O
gone O
away. O

It's O
been O
reported O
that O
this O
place O
was O
visited O
by O
people O
of O
the O
highest O
rank, O
at O
least O
by O
deputies. O

So O
if O
there's O
money, O
you O
can O
go O
to O
other O
restaurants, O
not O
write O
crap O
about O
fridge O
salads. O

Near O
the O
Book O
House, O
there O
was O
a O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
windows O
on O
the O
waterfront O
with O
a O
tasty O
name O
for O
appetit. O

Several O
rooms B-TARGET
are O
conveniently O
located, O
but O
the O
non-smoker B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
located O
right O
at O
the O
entrance. O

The O
couchiest B-TARGET
in O
the O
smoking B-TARGET
zone. I-TARGET

There's O
a O
Fashion O
on O
the O
big O
screen, O
a O
nice, O
quiet O
interior B-TARGET
for O
friendly O
encounters. O

Before O
this O
weekend, O
I O
liked O
him... O
"All O
mixed O
up O
in O
the O
house..." O
(c) O

Service B-TARGET
is O
bad. O

You O
met O
him, O
you O
sat O
him O
down, O
you O
gave O
him O
the O
menu-- O
it's O
okay. O

Apparently, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
was O
working, O
if O
not O
the O
first O
day, O
but O
the O
second O
day O
is O
for O
sure. O

Maybe O
he'll O
learn-- O
he'll O
do O
better, O
he'll O
always O
do O
good. O

But O
what O
my O
pasta O
was O
carrying O
to O
me O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
is O
barbarism. O

I O
almost O
starved O
to O
death. O

Nice O
soup B-TARGET
I O
had O
to O
eat. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
kitchen's O
concerned, O
did O
the O
cook B-TARGET
change? O

My O
order O
is: O
Miso; O
she O
wanted O
soup O
with O
Norwegian O
salmon, O
but O
it O
turns O
out O
there's O
no O
salmon B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant, O
which O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
told O
us O
in O
20 O
minutes O
(one O
more O
stone O
in O
her O
garden); O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushrooms, I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
paste I-TARGET
(mostly O
tomato B-TARGET
paste). I-TARGET

I O
was O
upset O
by O
my O
earlier O
favorite O
Appetite. B-TARGET

First O
time O
was O
in O
Appetite O
a O
year O
ago. O

She O
was O
pleased O
with O
both O
the O
meeting, O
the O
service, O
and O
the O
kitchen O
(+ O
happy O
with O
the O
democratic O
order O
of O
prices). O

So, O
based O
on O
her O
positive O
impressions O
and O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
our O
location, O
she O
decided O
to O
sit O
there O
with O
her O
friends. O

There O
were O
four O
of O
us. O

We O
came O
in, O
we O
were O
met, O
we O
were O
led, O
we O
were O
put O
away, O
they O
brought O
in O
a O
menu O
and... O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
is O
missing... O
20 O
minutes. O

They O
called, O
came O
over, O
ordered O
pasta, O
fresh O
juice, O
drinks. O

In O
15 O
minutes, O
they O
brought O
drinks... O

Another O
15 O
minutes O
later, O
the O
first O
portion O
of O
the O
paste O
appeared... O
the O
second O
and O
third O
were O
served O
in O
15 O
minutes, O
and O
the O
last O
one O
was O
delivered O
when O
the O
others O
were O
finished... O

Then O
there O
was O
the O
order O
for O
Caesar's O
salad O
and O
the O
American... O

Waited O
for O
a O
long O
time... O
patience O
at O
the O
limit... O
the O
result O
was O
no O
tips O
left. O
(It O
may O
not O
be O
right, O
man O
did O
work, O
but... O
gratitude O
only O
deserved O
to O
be O
spoken) O

The O
beer, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
is O
delicious, O
but O
the O
service, B-TARGET
no, O
ordered O
a O
plate O
of O
beer O
so O
that O
the O
beer O
would O
have O
something O
to O
drink O
and O
meat. O

They O
brought O
a O
plate O
for O
a O
beer O
when O
they O
already O
got O
two O
beers. O

If O
the O
establishment O
still O
calls O
itself O
a O
restaurant, O
at O
least O
bring O
it O
hot O
at O
the O
same O
time! O

A O
company O
of O
four, O
everyone O
got O
their O
share O
after O
a O
long O
time, O
although O
some O
of O
the O
dishes O
were O
the O
same. O

The O
meat O
had O
been O
waiting O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
bringing O
in O
the O
garrison O
and O
40 O
minutes O
later. O

And O
to O
the O
question O
of O
why, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
said, O
"Well, O
I O
brought O
you O
a O
garrison, O
and O
you O
ate O
it... O
here's O
meat) O
()) O
()) O
(c)) O
(c)) O

Good O
afternoon. O

It O
was O
celebrated O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
March O
7th, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
dinner O
party O
for O
20 O
people. O

Since O
they O
opened O
recently, O
there O
were O
no O
calls, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
scary O
to O
go O
to O
a O
new O
place, O
but O
since O
they O
lived O
next O
door, O
they O
decided O
to O
take O
the O
risk, O
and O
they O
didn't O
regret O
it!!!! O

We O
paid O
in O
advance, O
we O
helped O
put O
the O
menu O
together O
individually O
for O
our O
requests O
and O
budget. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
arrived, O
everything O
had O
been O
ready, O
the O
tables O
had O
been O
covered, O
the O
food O
had O
been O
served. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
awesome, O
the O
meals B-TARGET
are O
big, O
everyone's O
very O
happy!!! O

It O
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
to O
the O
program B-TARGET
- O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
(girl O
sings O
very O
beautifully), O
and O
the O
Georgian B-TARGET
dance I-TARGET
group I-TARGET
- O
amazing!!!! O

The O
hall B-TARGET
was O
very O
big, O
light, O
except O
for O
us O
there O
were O
two O
more O
canteens, O
but O
no O
one O
got O
in O
the O
way O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
big O
space. O

There's O
no O
cork B-TARGET
collection. I-TARGET

So O
everyone O
was O
very O
happy, O
thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
wonderful O
holiday, O
we'll O
have O
to O
come O
to O
you O
again!!!!!!! O

You O
came O
into O
this O
place O
by O
accident O
with O
your O
friends. O

Ordered. O

We O
were O
sitting O
on O
the O
street, O
and O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
there O
was O
a O
feast. O

They O
asked O
for O
a O
blanket. O

It's O
been O
15 O
minutes, O
no O
plaque, O
no O
waiter. B-TARGET

They O
went O
by O
themselves, O
took O
the O
patches. O

Tea O
came O
in O
ten O
minutes O
after O
the O
order. O

Then, O
20 O
minutes O
later, O
they O
brought O
in O
one O
salad. O

It's O
been O
20 O
minutes O
since O
they O
brought O
in O
a O
hot O
one O
(the O
order O
was O
made O
for O
six O
people). O

And O
that's O
how O
all O
night O
-- O
which O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
ate O
and O
someone O
was O
just O
waiting O
-- O
so O
I O
got O
my O
meal O
1 O
hour O
40 O
minutes O
after O
the O
order O
-- O
the O
vegetables O
could O
have O
been O
cooked O
fast, O
and O
after O
my O
husband's O
three O
trips O
to O
the O
waiter. O

The O
lines B-TARGET
stated O
on O
the O
menu O
clearly O
do O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
actual O
size O
of O
the O
meal O
and O
the O
baby O
will O
not O
be O
fed! O

I O
don't O
advise O
anyone! O

We O
celebrated O
a O
friend's O
wedding. O

We O
arrived O
tonight, O
it O
rained, O
and O
that's O
the O
only O
flaw O
in O
the O
evening. O

Which O
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise, O
waitresses!!!!! B-TARGET
all O
the O
smiles O
on O
the O
chin O
are O
very O
sincere O
and O
kind, O
not O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
getting O
tips O
(as O
well O
as O
tips-it's O
a O
feast), O
they O
meet, O
they O
conduct, O
and O
throughout O
the O
holiday, O
untruthfully O
"like O
invisibles" O
changed O
dishes, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
they O
had O
to O
come O
right O
away) O

Anyway, O
thank O
you O
very O
much. O
I O
haven't O
seen O
this O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
while. O

They O
couldn't O
see O
the O
menu, O
so O
I O
don't O
know O
the O
names, O
the O
prices, O
either. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
shrimp B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
leaves I-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
the O
eggplant O
roulettes B-TARGET
(the O
filler B-TARGET
included O
walnuts, B-TARGET
the O
rest O
was O
not O
understood)), O
the O
cold B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
and, O
curly, O
the O
rice- B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
vegetables--a I-TARGET
truly O
beautiful O
and O
tasty O
dish. B-TARGET

The O
pork B-TARGET
was O
somehow O
unfried. O

I O
want O
to O
celebrate O
the O
interior-- B-TARGET
especially O
outside-- O
swings, O
gazebos, O
"fun" O
figures-- O
all O
the O
pictures O
came O
out O
of O
paint) O

I've O
already O
recommended O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
all O
my O
friends. O

Not O
only O
did O
young O
people O
enjoy O
it, O
but O
older O
people O
also O
liked O
it. O

Note O
that O
he O
was O
chosen O
by O
our O
fiancé's O
parents, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
Natalia O
A.'s O
review O
of O
our O
friend's O
mother, O
so O
don't O
be O
so O
skeptical, O
people O
have O
been O
choosing O
this O
place O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
have O
written O
a O
frank O
review, O
even O
though O
it's O
a O
brief O
one, O
but O
honestly O
and O
without O
a O
paphos)) O

We O
stopped O
by O
last O
night O
with O
a O
friend O
for O
a O
bite O
to O
eat. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
really O
nice, O
everybody O
tells, O
shows, O
smiles, O
doors O
open. O

We O
weren't O
offered O
to O
go O
upstairs, O
they O
smoke. O

As O
I O
understand O
it, O
all O
the O
best O
places O
are O
always O
for O
smokers, O
unfortunately. O

There's O
an O
open O
kitchen O
on O
the O
ground O
floor, O
all O
set O
up O
with O
a O
tile O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
tables-- O
not O
very O
cozy, O
but O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
really O
interesting, O
at O
least O
something O
original O
for O
this O
format. O

From O
the O
food O
on O
the O
tip O
of O
the O
previous O
review, O
she O
took O
a O
shaver B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a O
chicken O
(270p), O
unhappily, O
too O
much O
test, B-TARGET
and O
somehow O
freshly, O
the O
fries B-TARGET
liked O
her O
more O
than O
the O
shamerma O
itself. O

She O
also O
tasted O
shrimp B-TARGET
noodles I-TARGET
(360p), O
and O
she O
liked O
it. O

There O
could O
be O
more O
money, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
but O
that's O
ideal. O

A O
little O
weird O
crunchy O
something O
adorned O
the O
dish O
on O
top, O
it O
didn't O
taste, O
and O
I O
didn't O
realize O
what O
it O
was O
and O
why O
it O
was O
put O
on.) O

I O
drank O
a O
milk O
ulun O
(180 O
p) O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
him O
except O
he O
was O
preparing O
for O
about O
20 O
to O
25 O
minutes, O
like O
a O
mineral. O

The O
food O
was O
brought, O
and O
the O
drinks O
were O
gone, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
politely O
remind O
you, O
and O
it O
all O
came O
out. O

To O
come O
in O
for O
a O
bite O
and O
run, O
it's O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
middle O
if O
they O
serve O
fast) O

We O
had O
a O
celebration O
in O
March O
2014 O
at O
the O
Mountain O
Restaurant. O

Always O
talking O
to O
Catherine's O
manager, B-TARGET
who O
answered O
all O
our O
questions, O
went O
a O
lot O
to O
the O
meeting, O
and O
everything O
that O
was O
agreed O
was O
done. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
satisfied. O

Twice O
visiting O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
food O
that O
was O
delicious. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
quite O
common O
at O
the O
feast, O
and O
everything O
was O
done O
well, O
but O
nothing O
that O
we O
think O
is O
remembered, O
and O
many O
of O
the O
guests O
look O
at O
it. O

The O
hot B-TARGET
one, I-TARGET
which O
is O
pork B-TARGET
bark I-TARGET
and O
salmon, B-TARGET
is O
done O
very O
well, O
all O
soft O
and O
juicey. O

The O
day O
after O
the O
celebration, O
we O
remembered O
that O
there O
were O
no O
fruit O
on O
the O
tables, O
although O
they O
were O
included O
in O
the O
contract O
and O
thus O
paid O
for. O

So, O
distinguished O
visitors, O
make O
sure O
that O
everything O
you've O
been O
ordered O
is O
brought O
to O
you. O

Children O
can O
be O
fed O
on O
a O
special O
children O
&apos; O
s O
menu O
during O
the O
feast, O
but O
on O
that O
day O
the O
cook B-TARGET
thought, O
according O
to O
the O
waiter, O
that O
the O
food O
ordered O
by O
the O
children O
only O
needed O
to O
be O
delivered O
to O
the O
main O
dish O
of O
all O
the O
guests O
(about O
two O
hours O
after O
the O
event O
began). O

Is O
it O
okay O
for O
children O
to O
sit O
hungry O
and O
look O
around O
for O
hours?! O

After O
you O
went O
to O
the O
manager, B-TARGET
they O
got O
everything O
ready O
and O
served. O

So, O
check O
it O
out O
with O
the O
waiters O
right O
away. O

I O
thought O
I'd O
take O
the O
girls O
out O
for O
a O
break, O
and O
I O
found O
a O
comfortable O
Grand B-TARGET
Cafe I-TARGET
21 I-TARGET
Versta I-TARGET
on O
the O
Internet. O

Called O
for O
a O
table, O
answered O
by O
a O
nice O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
Evgenius, O
booked O
us O
a O
table, O
given O
all O
our O
wishes, O
for O
which O
he O
has O
a O
huge O
special O
thank-you!!!!!!!!!! O

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
cafe O
at O
the O
scheduled O
time, O
a O
nice O
young B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
met O
us O
and O
accompanied O
us O
to O
the O
table. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
wonderful O
girl B-TARGET
who O
politely O
and O
patiently O
answered O
all O
our O
questions. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
the O
meals B-TARGET
are O
huge, O
thank O
you O
very O
much!!!!!!!!!! O

Service B-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

I O
liked O
everything: O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
living B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
cafe, O
and O
for O
a O
moment, O
they O
didn't O
regret O
coming O
here. O

I'm O
gonna O
recommend O
it O
to O
my O
friends O
and O
I'm O
gonna O
come O
back O
here O
again. O

YOUNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

Hang O
on!!!!!!!!!! O

The O
impression O
of O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
didn't O
leave O
the O
best!! O

It's O
a O
shame... O
a O
new O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
middle O
of O
town! O

First O
of O
all, O
no O
one O
meets O
or O
walks O
to O
the O
table, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
fact O
that O
no O
smoking O
room O
has O
been O
offered O
at O
all! O

My O
friend O
ordered O
a O
business O
lunch, O
and O
I O
never O
saw O
the O
menu O
because O
it O
wasn't O
brought!!! O

The O
order O
was O
taken O
awfully, O
after O
the O
outgoing O
waiter, B-TARGET
we O
made O
our O
order!!!! O

I O
ordered O
tea, O
but O
even O
it O
was O
brought O
without O
jasmine!) O

The O
bread O
was O
not O
offered, O
but O
nothing O
was O
offered O
at O
all!!!! O

With O
this O
kind O
of O
service, B-TARGET
the O
institution O
is O
unlikely O
to O
have O
regular O
guests!! O

Now... O
worse... O
the O
bill O
was O
passed O
when O
we O
were O
still O
eating, O
and O
we O
didn't O
even O
ask O
for O
it, O
but O
they O
don't O
like O
it O
in O
this O
place O
when O
the O
guests O
are O
late, O
so O
it O
seems O
like O
we're O
definitely O
on O
our O
way!!!!! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
sweet, O
there O
are O
sofas, B-TARGET
really O
not O
very O
soft! O

Previous O
reviews O
describe O
the O
institution O
to O
varying O
degrees, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
note O
separately: O
1. O

It O
was O
us, O
last O
Friday, O
that O
was O
unlucky: O
four O
girls B-TARGET
were O
working, O
two O
of O
whom O
were O
clearly O
"swimming" O
- O
the O
wine O
was O
brought O
after O
almost O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting, O
after O
a O
few O
nice O
reminders, O
not O
chilled O
and O
quite O
different, O
if O
the O
food O
had O
been O
ordered O
(not O
found), O
the O
food O
had O
been O
waiting O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time, O
the O
food B-TARGET
had, O
however, O
been O
tasty, O
even O
though O
the O
meals B-TARGET
could O
have O
been O
more O
(especially O
the O
garrison) B-TARGET
2. O

There O
were O
coupons, O
two O
people O
with O
two O
bottles O
of O
cafeteria O
wine, O
just O
3,000 O
rubles. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
a O
really O
great O
singer. O

It O
was O
a O
birthday O
party, O
a O
company O
of O
eight. O

Well, O
I O
liked O
it. O

On O
the O
menu: B-TARGET
A O
pricer O
above O
the O
average, O
a O
small O
choice O
of O
salads O
from O
companies O
has O
been O
tried: O
salts, O
mushrooms O
and O
fish, O
fried O
camber, O
pork O
bark, O
mozzarella O
pork O
and O
mushrooms, O
eel. O

I O
liked O
it-- O
big O
shots. B-TARGET

Service: O
Several O
slow O
waitresses. B-TARGET

The O
blobs O
were O
long O
and O
uneven O
(half O
of O
the O
people O
were O
sitting O
with O
empty O
plates O
and O
the O
other O
one O
had O
not O
even O
received O
an O
appetizer). O

It O
took O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
with O
the O
buns B-TARGET
(and O
they O
were O
very O
tasty). O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
didn't O
bring O
the O
bill. O

In O
principle, O
the O
celebration O
was O
successful O
and O
the O
shortcomings O
did O
not O
ruin O
the O
general O
impression. O

You O
had O
dinner O
with O
your O
friend O
recently. O

They've O
been O
watching O
the O
driveway O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
and O
finally O
they've O
made O
up O
their O
minds. O

We O
were O
met O
by O
tired O
but O
friendly O
girls, O
and O
they O
walked O
us O
to O
the O
table O
right O
away. O

The O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window O
is O
above O
praise. O

I O
don't O
remember O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

That's O
what O
I'm O
talking O
about. O

I O
just O
remember O
the O
cutlery, O
glasses, O
and O
spice O
are O
along O
the O
wall O
on O
a O
low O
step. O

And O
that O
children O
run O
by. O

And O
these O
instruments O
are O
drawn O
to O
their O
favorite O
toys. O

It's O
okay, O
it's O
funny, O
but O
I O
wiped O
my O
instruments O
with O
a O
napkin O
just O
in O
case. O

The B-TARGET
menu O
seemed O
a O
little O
boring, O
but O
we O
made O
a O
quick O
choice. O

A O
friend O
ate O
tomato O
soup O
and O
a O
marble O
beef O
steak O
with O
fresh O
tomatoes, O
and O
I'm O
the O
same O
grilled O
steak. O

What O
can O
I O
say... O

The O
meat B-TARGET
was O
roasted O
a O
little O
more O
than O
it O
was O
ordered, O
but O
still O
tasty O
and O
tender. O

For O
dessert, O
they O
tasted O
chocolate O
cupcakes O
with O
hot O
chocolate O
inside O
and O
ice O
cream. O

That's O
what O
was O
really O
incredibly O
good. O

They're O
recommended O
to O
be O
tried O
by O
everyone! O

The O
service B-TARGET
wasn't O
impressive. O

Honestly. O

The O
ashtray O
was O
changed O
very O
rarely, O
the O
dirty O
dishes O
were O
not O
noticed O
for O
10 O
minutes, O
and O
that O
was O
because O
they O
ran O
past O
the O
table O
not O
once O
or O
twice. O

But O
during O
direct O
communication, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
sweet O
and O
friendly, O
which O
made O
a O
negative O
impression. O

Well, O
it O
was O
really O
nice. O

Did O
I O
like O
it? O

More O
like O
yes O
than O
no. O

Will O
I O
go O
back O
there? O

More O
likely O
not O
than O
yes. O

Today's O
birthday O
was O
celebrated O
by O
a O
small O
company O
of O
six. O

We O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
VIP O
Hall. O

I O
liked O
the O
layout B-TARGET
of O
the O
table, O
and O
the B-TARGET
candlelight I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
candlelights O
on O
fire O
created O
a O
comfortable O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
family O
celebration. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
beautiful: O
the O
dishes O
were O
cleaned O
at O
once, O
the O
new O
dishes O
were O
brought O
quickly, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O
wait. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
also O
pleasantly O
surprised, O
especially O
the O
size O
of O
the O
servings. B-TARGET

Everything O
was O
fresh O
and O
delicious. O

The O
only O
"but" O
is O
the O
absence O
of O
live O
music, O
which O
would O
make O
our O
evening O
even O
more O
pleasant. O

And O
for O
a O
relatively O
small O
amount O
of O
money, O
they O
had O
a O
great O
time O
off O
and O
ate. O

Next O
time, O
I O
won't O
think O
about O
where O
to O
go O
to O
celebrate. O

I've O
recently O
visited O
this O
restaurant, O
and O
I O
agree O
with O
many O
that O
the O
main B-TARGET
hall I-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
tight, O
but O
I O
like O
that O
there's O
a O
children's B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
when O
the O
baby O
was O
babysitting O
while O
we O
had O
dinner, O
plus O
there's O
a O
free O
children's B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
for O
the O
kids. O

Yeah, O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
loud, O
but O
I O
liked O
that O
it O
was O
national O
and O
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

He O
was O
served O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
who O
was O
constantly O
smiling O
and O
advising O
us O
on O
good O
food. B-TARGET

The O
kitchen O
really O
looks O
like O
Greek. O

Delicious O
barbecue B-TARGET
and O
a O
beautiful O
choice O
of O
salads, B-TARGET
quite O
a O
choice O
of O
alcohol. B-TARGET

Plus O
the O
price O
isn't O
high O
for O
the O
city O
center. O

So O
I O
think O
we'll O
do O
it O
again O
and O
again. O

We O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
our O
husband O
today. O

We O
heard O
a O
lot O
of O
flattery, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
make O
sure. O

The O
impressions O
remain O
very O
good. O

We O
were O
welcomed, O
the O
halls O
were O
shown, O
and O
we O
finally O
picked O
a O
table O
on O
the O
veranda. O

There O
wasn't O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
a O
very O
comfortable O
environment, B-TARGET
and O
a O
long O
time O
to O
sit O
down. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
fairly O
simple, O
but O
in O
Georgian O
style, O
the O
music B-TARGET
plays O
nicely. O

Anyway, O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
go O
fast... O

Very O
lucky O
to O
have O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
was O
very O
kind O
and O
quick O
to O
serve O
us. O

Seeing O
some O
of O
our O
difficulties, O
he O
gave O
us O
a O
very O
detailed O
account O
of O
the O
dishes, O
and O
gave O
us O
his O
advice O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
food. O

The O
order O
was O
made O
very O
quickly, O
not O
for O
more O
than O
15 O
minutes. O

What O
you O
can O
say O
about O
the O
kitchen... O
the O
hot B-TARGET
one O
was O
very O
happy, O
especially O
the O
tasty O
meat-- B-TARGET
the O
soft O
juicy, O
deliciously O
cooked O
vegetables. B-TARGET

The O
salmon B-TARGET
pebble I-TARGET
was O
clearly O
small O
and O
practically O
no O
vegetables O
were O
available. O

You're O
not O
much O
of O
a O
eater. O

The O
salad B-TARGET
was O
filled O
with O
too O
sharp O
sauce. B-TARGET

The O
wine B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
expensive, O
so O
it O
had O
to O
be O
done O
with O
beer O
and O
a O
pretty O
tasty O
home B-TARGET
mooring. I-TARGET

The O
choice O
of O
food B-TARGET
is O
wide O
enough, O
so O
I O
think O
next O
time O
we'll O
try O
something O
else. O

Yesterday O
was O
your O
first O
visit O
to O
Commandant O
2. O

It's O
a O
very O
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
attention O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
above O
praise! O

For O
a O
long O
time O
we O
were O
the O
regulars O
of O
another O
Italian O
restaurant, O
now O
our O
hearts O
(and O
stomachs) O
belong O
to O
Capone!! B-TARGET

It O
was O
a O
little O
risky O
for O
us O
to O
come O
to O
you O
yesterday O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
dinner O
was O
planned O
for O
my O
D.R. O

But O
we O
were O
very O
excited, O
and O
this O
morning, O
speaking O
to O
our O
friends, O
urged O
everyone O
to O
come O
to O
you!!!! O

For O
a O
long O
time, O
I've O
been O
more O
than O
calm O
about O
my O
birthday, O
confined O
to O
a O
quiet O
family O
dinner. O

But O
yesterday... O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
many O
years, O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
holiday O
came O
back O
as O
a O
childhood! O

Why O
thank O
you O
so O
much!!! O

I O
want O
to O
celebrate O
the O
quality O
of O
living B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

It O
was O
nice O
to O
be O
surprised! O

And O
of O
course O
our O
compliments O
to O
the O
cook!! B-TARGET

And O
the O
taste O
and O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
highly O
appreciated!!! O

We'll O
have O
to O
come O
to O
you O
on O
all O
the O
grounds O
and O
without O
them, O
and O
of O
course O
we'll O
recommend O
your O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
all O
our O
friends! O

Again, O
thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
a O
great O
evening!!! O

We O
went O
to O
a O
friend's O
wedding O
yesterday, O
celebrated O
at O
the O
Valley O
restaurant. O

Evening O
was O
great! O

It's O
beautiful O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
have O
been O
arranged. O

And O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
and O
the O
interior... B-TARGET

It's O
very O
cozy O
and O
beautiful, O
and O
it's O
not O
normal. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
great, O
it O
was O
fun! O

And O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
liked O
it, O
so O
they O
weren't O
obsessive O
or O
visible, O
but O
even O
though O
the O
glasses O
were O
always O
full, O
the O
dishes O
were O
cleaned O
up O
in O
time. O

Good O
job, O
guys. O

Anyway, O
I O
really O
liked O
it O
there, O
and O
I'd O
love O
to O
go O
out O
there O
tonight. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
great!! O

She O
didn't O
even O
bother O
to O
go O
to O
the O
site O
and O
leave O
her O
feedback. O

I've O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
D.R. O
at O
this O
place O
with O
my O
friends' O
company. O

Before O
that, O
he O
came O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
times, O
and O
there O
were O
some O
pleasant O
impressions O
left O
of O
the O
visits. O

Greetings, O
good O
choice O
of O
beer, B-TARGET
quick O
execution B-TARGET
of O
the O
order. O

The O
availability O
of O
your O
beer B-TARGET
at O
an O
acceptable O
price O
and O
good O
taste O
has O
also O
been O
encouraging. O

The O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance, O
Monday. O

However, O
on O
Friday, O
when O
I O
came O
to O
celebrate O
and O
decided O
to O
order O
their O
beer, O
I O
was O
told O
that O
there O
was O
only O
one O
beer O
available, O
not O
a O
local O
beer. B-TARGET

I'm O
upset, O
but O
I'm O
not O
gonna O
cancel O
everything, O
especially O
since O
the O
guests O
are O
getting O
a O
little O
closer... O

It O
wasn't O
until O
half O
an O
hour O
before O
we O
got O
the O
beer O
we O
needed. O

Next O
time O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
able O
to O
call O
when O
the O
glasses O
were O
empty O
for O
10 O
minutes... O

We O
decided O
to O
order O
a O
little O
more O
beer O
so O
we O
wouldn't O
wait O
any O
longer. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
brought O
one O
glass O
and O
said O
there O
was O
no O
more O
beer!!! B-TARGET

I O
didn't O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
this O
place B-TARGET
anymore. O

Thank O
God O
we O
have O
other O
places O
in O
town O
where O
beer O
doesn't O
run O
out O
in O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
maintenance O
staff O
don't O
forget O
about O
your O
table O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

So O
the O
evening O
was O
saved, O
and O
the O
globe B-TARGET
was O
left O
with O
a O
very O
unpleasant O
siege... O

I've O
been O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
for O
once. O

We O
came O
tonight O
to O
listen O
to O
live O
music, O
to O
rest O
and O
talk. O

They O
booked O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

We're O
all O
happy. O

There's O
a O
cafeteria O
on O
the O
first O
floor, O
and O
there's O
three O
rooms O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O

I O
can't O
say O
for O
sure O
about O
the O
food... O
it's O
impossible O
once O
to O
evaluate O
everything, O
but O
what O
was O
ordered O
was O
in O
line O
with O
my O
taste O
and O
my O
taste. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
varied, O
the O
prices O
are O
adequate. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

There O
are O
tables B-TARGET
for O
all O
tastes O
and O
sofas O
and O
by O
the O
window O
and O
across O
the O
stage. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
good O
music, B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
the O
Egeiro O
Project O
that O
night. O

P. O

S. O

It's O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
night's O
rest. O

We'll O
have O
to O
come O
again. O

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
evening O
in O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

Crazy O
likes O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
your O
fine O
simplicity-- O
cozy O
and O
warm. O

The O
friendly O
atmosphere B-TARGET
that O
prevails O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
encouraging. O

A O
special O
thank O
you O
for O
serving B-TARGET
our O
waitress B-TARGET
(unfortunately, O
I O
don't O
know O
her O
name) O
- O
well, O
she O
knew O
the O
menu, O
she O
wasn't O
obsessive O
about O
her O
choice O
of O
food. O

Everything O
you've O
ordered O
has O
been O
eaten O
with O
great O
pleasure! O

Salad B-TARGET
Pampellon I-TARGET
liked O
it O
very O
much-- O
a O
spinach B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
blue I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
under O
a O
fantastic O
gas O
station B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
"something O
with O
something"! O

The O
soup B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
lentils I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
foxes I-TARGET
was O
also O
insanely O
tasty. O

I O
didn't O
get O
to O
the O
dessert-- O
so O
full O
of O
salad B-TARGET
and O
soup, B-TARGET
I O
couldn't O
even O
try O
a O
piece. O

But O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
that O
the O
friends O
ordered O
looked O
delicious, O
and O
according O
to O
their O
enthralled O
cries, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
their O
expectations O
had O
been O
fulfilled;). O

So O
if O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
time O
in O
a O
cozy, O
friendly, O
friendly O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
have O
a O
good O
meal, O
then O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
exactly O
what O
it O
needs;) O

Visited O
a O
restaurant O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
friends. O

Impressive O
isn't O
the O
best. O

First, O
the O
menu O
was O
waiting O
for O
15 O
minutes O
(although O
the O
people O
weren't O
much), O
then O
15 O
minutes O
to O
order, O
just O
above O
the O
average O
price O
in O
the O
city, O
but O
the O
quality O
left O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
the O
salads B-TARGET
were O
small O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
even O
rubber, O
and O
the O
ashtray O
was O
never O
changed O
in O
all O
the O
time. O

A O
place O
for O
tonight's O
rest. O

The O
space B-TARGET
is O
large O
enough, O
there O
is O
a O
non-smoking B-TARGET
area I-TARGET
and O
a O
children O
&apos; O
s B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
(and O
it O
is O
located O
behind O
the O
glass O
near O
the O
nonsmoker O
zone, O
very O
convenient O
to O
watch O
the O
children). O

There O
are O
tables O
around O
the O
window O
for O
two O
with O
funny O
wicked B-TARGET
hammocks I-TARGET
instead O
of O
chairs. O

There's O
a O
little O
dance B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
next O
to O
the O
photan O
(there's O
a O
nice O
house B-TARGET
playing O
there, O
by O
the O
way), O
a O
lot O
of O
plasma B-TARGET
panels, I-TARGET
twirled O
sofas, B-TARGET
it's O
obvious O
that O
people O
have O
done O
their O
best O
with O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

The O
trim B-TARGET
is O
cheap O
everywhere, O
but O
the O
space B-TARGET
itself O
looks O
cozy O
and O
festive. O

Garderob B-TARGET
is O
also O
present. O

The B-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
wasn't O
very O
impressive, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
enough O
for O
the O
bar, O
even O
though O
the O
prices O
seemed O
a O
little O
overpriced. O

The O
absence O
of O
mussels B-TARGET
and O
some O
dried-up O
dryers, B-TARGET
who O
had O
been O
cooking O
for O
quite O
some O
time, O
was O
disappointing. O

My O
friend O
ordered O
sushi, B-TARGET
said O
it O
was O
delicious. O

A O
small O
choice O
of O
beer B-TARGET
(but O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
excellent), O
at O
all, O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
small O
choice O
of O
alcohol B-TARGET
for O
the O
bar. O

The O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
very O
beautiful, O
and O
the O
photos O
are O
on O
the O
menu, O
and O
you O
can O
see O
what O
you're O
ordering, O
and O
they're O
very O
convenient. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
happy O
because, O
in O
a O
pretty O
full O
room, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
wouldn't O
wait, O
he O
would O
paradically O
bark O
the O
dishes O
and O
ask O
if O
there O
was O
anything O
to O
do. O

I O
liked O
it, O
I O
ticked O
it. O

I'd O
like O
to O
thank O
you O
for O
the O
unexpected O
pleasant O
impression O
that O
your O
restaurant B-TARGET
staff O
and O
atmosphere I-TARGET
have O
made O
on O
me! O

We O
arrived O
at O
the O
14.02 O
company, O
booking O
a O
table O
in O
advance, O
and O
the O
girl B-TARGET
on O
the O
phone O
was O
very O
kind O
and O
polite, O
when O
we O
walked O
into O
the O
restaurant O
and O
met O
us O
right O
away O
and O
spent O
at O
the O
desired O
table O
on O
the O
terrace O
with O
a O
view O
to O
the O
marina, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
a O
young O
man, O
she O
didn't O
keep O
herself O
waiting, O
and O
she O
was O
very O
good O
at O
the O
menu, O
and O
she O
helped O
us O
pick O
out O
the O
food O
we O
wanted. O

It's O
a O
very O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
it's O
been O
a O
jazz O
night, O
and O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
very O
happy O
too! O

Make O
sure O
we O
come O
again, O
it'll O
be O
nice O
if O
we O
get O
a O
permanent O
guest O
card! O

Went O
into O
the O
restaurant O
on O
the O
day O
off O
by O
accident. O

The O
sister O
who O
happens O
to O
be O
there O
often O
advised. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
pretty O
cozy, O
nice O
home O
environment. B-TARGET

There O
weren't O
many O
people, O
so O
we O
got O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window O
with O
a O
view O
of O
the O
Grand O
Prospect. O

That's O
not O
bad. O

The O
food's B-TARGET
good, O
but O
it's O
not O
big. O

There O
were O
four O
of O
us O
and O
we O
all O
ordered O
pasta. O

Everyone O
was O
pretty O
well O
cooked. O

The O
salads B-TARGET
were O
delicious O
at O
all. O

I O
took O
pasta O
and O
mushrooms. O

Mm-hmm. O

It's O
good. O

One O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
we've O
been O
served O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time. O

On O
our O
point, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
said O
they O
had O
some O
problems O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

We O
didn't O
find O
out O
what O
the O
problem O
was, O
but O
the O
mood O
was O
broken. O

The O
prices O
are O
medium. O

Yeah, O
and O
the O
restaurant O
keeps O
tips O
on O
their O
own. O

It's O
not O
bad. O

You O
can O
also O
buy O
olive O
oil O
at O
home. O

It's O
really O
good. O

Have O
a O
nice O
time. O

Okay, O
I'll O
start O
at O
the O
end. O

Everything O
was O
fine!!!!! O

I O
guess O
I'm O
a O
conservator O
because O
I O
love O
a O
place O
like O
this: O
good O
interior, B-TARGET
soft O
music, B-TARGET
quiet O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
polite O
and O
courteous O
staff. B-TARGET

I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
near O
home. O

It O
took O
me O
a O
long O
time O
to O
pick O
a O
place... O

To O
walk, O
to O
put O
a O
child O
in O
a O
children's O
room, O
and O
to O
get O
more O
or O
less O
feedback. O

This O
is O
the O
restaurant O
that O
made O
the O
choice. O

The O
hall O
was O
half O
empty, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
herself O
offered O
a O
place O
in O
the O
corner O
for O
us O
(I, O
my O
wife, O
and O
my O
son, O
six O
years O
old). O

The O
blues B-TARGET
that O
they O
ordered, O
they O
all O
liked O
it. O

The O
couple O
liked O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
they O
cooked, O
Caesar's B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
salmon, B-TARGET
no O
questions, O
etc. O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
followed O
the O
table O
and O
changed O
the O
ashtray O
in O
time O
and O
added O
wine, O
i.e. O

The O
service B-TARGET
it's O
supposed O
to O
be O
is O
classic. O

I've O
been O
waiting, O
I've O
been O
thinking... O

I O
don't O
know O
what O
kind O
of O
downsides O
to O
find! O

It's O
great. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
and O
certainly O
not O
the O
last! O

They O
celebrated O
their O
son O
&apos; O
s O
wedding O
in O
the O
banquet O
hall O
in O
July O
2013. O

The O
hall B-TARGET
is O
great. O

But... O

We've O
chosen O
the O
average O
in O
the O
price O
category O
of O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

When O
they O
came, O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
a O
little O
stew. B-TARGET

I O
thought O
there O
should O
be O
more. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
hit O
with O
dried O
cheese. B-TARGET

The O
fruit B-TARGET
was O
on O
its O
last O
breath. O

When O
I O
tasted O
the O
salads, B-TARGET
I O
was O
terrified. O

By O
quality, O
they're O
drawn O
to O
a O
diner, O
not O
a O
feast O
hall. O

Before O
I O
ordered O
the O
party, O
I O
ordered O
something O
at O
the O
coffee O
shop O
on O
the O
first O
floor. O

I B-TARGET
liked O
the O
food. O

But O
it's O
like O
someone O
else O
is O
preparing O
for O
the O
party. O

The O
hot B-TARGET
one I-TARGET
didn't O
like O
it O
either. O

We O
had O
our O
own O
cake. O

The O
wedding, O
of O
course, O
was O
fun, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
didn't O
adorn O
it. O

When O
the O
young O
men O
left, O
the O
guests O
separated, O
and O
I O
asked O
them O
to O
pack O
up O
the O
rest. O

The O
receptionist O
said O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
packed O
and O
collected, O
including O
alcohol O
and O
juices. O

To O
my O
surprise, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
told O
me O
I O
could O
get O
it O
from O
the O
tables O
myself, O
they'd O
give O
me O
containers O
for O
a O
fee. O

After O
three O
minutes O
of O
argument, O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
them O
to O
fold O
up O
something. O

The O
remaining O
alcohol, O
water O
and O
juice O
were O
collected O
by O
themselves. O

A O
second O
son O
is O
getting O
married O
this O
year. O

When O
he O
said O
this O
room O
was O
already O
occupied O
on O
the O
right O
date, O
I O
was O
happy. O

My O
young O
man O
once O
booked O
a O
table O
for O
March O
8. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
so O
did O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Here's O
the O
service... B-TARGET
whether O
or O
not O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
trying O
to O
start O
celebrating O
the O
8th O
of O
March O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O
(We O
arrived O
there O
around O
9:30, O
a O
girl B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance O
said O
that O
the O
restaurant O
was O
open O
until O
11:00, O
even O
though, O
when O
the O
reservation O
was O
made, O
we O
had O
no O
warning O
that O
the O
restoran O
would O
be O
working O
until O
11:00.) O

The O
order O
came O
in O
pretty O
quick, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
started O
eating, O
the O
Hamsky O
girl B-TARGET
asked O
us O
to O
sit O
down O
for O
another O
table. O

I, O
of O
course, O
refused. O

The O
mood O
wasn't O
ruined O
(it O
was O
just O
unpleasant), O
but O
we O
didn't O
leave O
a O
tip. B-TARGET

Your O
restaurant, O
I'm O
not O
gonna O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone. O

Good O
afternoon! O

We O
were O
with O
friends O
yesterday O
in O
this O
cafe! O

I O
love O
it! O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
to O
the O
cooks, B-TARGET
very O
tasty O
dishes!!!!!!! B-TARGET

Ordered O
bivtexes, B-TARGET
no O
words O
as O
tasty O
))) O

It's O
very O
quick O
and O
it's O
very O
high-quality, O
it's O
like O
they've O
got O
masters O
working O
there! O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
good O
service, B-TARGET
the O
pleasant O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
and O
the O
hospitality O
of O
the O
waiters! B-TARGET

We O
hope O
to O
visit O
once O
again O
this O
wonderful, O
cozy O
place B-TARGET
with O
excellent O
kitchens B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

At O
first, O
I O
didn't O
want O
to O
come O
in-- O
it's O
too O
bright O
and O
it's O
too O
bright! O

When O
you O
enter, O
you O
get O
into O
a O
small O
cafe. O

At O
first, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
cafe, O
but O
climbing O
the O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
was O
shocked O
by O
the O
number O
of O
people!! O

It's O
just O
that O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
out O
there!! O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
had O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time-- O
provided O
they O
called O
her O
themselves, O
and O
not O
once!! O

They O
ordered O
chicken O
tobacco, O
Greek O
salad O
and O
beer! O

I O
have O
a O
principle-- O
any O
new O
place O
for O
me O
first O
thing O
I O
order O
a O
Greek O
salad-- O
you O
like O
it-- O
you O
could O
have O
it O
in O
mind, O
or O
the O
other O
way O
around-- O

The O
beer O
was O
brought O
quickly... O
when O
the O
saw-saw O
that O
the O
glass O
was O
dirty O
downstairs O
like O
a O
kefir. O
I O
thought, O
"Well, O
here O
it O
is!" O
but O
then O
I O
looked O
back O
and O
realized O
it O
was O
a O
glass O
with O
an O
indicator... O
how O
to O
say... O
a O
degree O
below O
0).)) O

The O
salad O
was O
brought O
in O
quickly, O
very O
much!! O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
gonna O
get O
worse. O

The O
vegetables O
of O
the O
fresh O
chickens O
have O
been O
waiting O
for O
a O
long O
time... O
probably O
half O
an O
hour. O

But O
it O
was O
worth O
it... O
well-prepared, O
properly O
prepared. O

Garlic's B-TARGET
good. O

The O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
attached, O
but O
I O
didn't O
like O
it... O
maybe O
because O
of O
the O
bread, O
because O
I O
drank O
it O
into O
the O
sauce... O

In O
fact, O
there O
was O
a O
pleasant O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
with O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
simple O
girl, B-TARGET
which O
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
case O
of O
administrators... B-TARGET
but O
God O
is O
with O
them! O

His O
D.D. O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
there. O

It O
was O
February O
1st. O

It's O
my O
second O
time, O
my O
friend. O

It's O
not O
too O
late, O
seven O
o'clock. O

The O
people O
were O
very O
few. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
enjoy O
the O
restaurant O
tastes O
of O
a O
companion. O

At O
the O
entrance, O
the O
girls B-TARGET
asked O
about O
our O
preferences O
and O
walked O
us O
to O
the O
second O
floor. O

Pretty O
detailed O
about O
all O
the O
facilities' O
charms. O

They O
offered O
to O
pick O
a O
table. O

Soft O
couchs B-TARGET
with O
pillow O
swelling. B-TARGET

Pretty O
nice O
little O
music B-TARGET
and O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
darkness. B-TARGET

For O
some O
reason, O
we O
were O
served O
by O
two O
waiters. O

The O
second O
was O
nice O
and O
kind, O
and O
as O
it O
turned O
out, O
he O
knew O
the O
ingredients O
of O
all O
the O
dishes. O

He O
helped O
a O
companion O
with O
a O
choice O
of O
wine, B-TARGET
and O
he O
helped O
me O
with O
a O
cocktail B-TARGET
drink, I-TARGET
and O
it's O
all O
taste O
and O
color O
here, O
as O
you O
can O
say. O

Bovine B-TARGET
medallions I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
were O
beautiful. O

Lately, O
I've O
gone O
completely O
away O
from O
the O
fish, O
and O
I'm O
happy O
to O
be O
served O
well O
cooked O
meat. B-TARGET

The O
order O
came O
fast O
enough. O

There O
were O
two O
people O
in O
the O
room O
at O
all O
times, O
so O
the O
calls O
came O
in O
for O
a O
minute. O

Spent O
more O
than O
two O
hours O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

Smile O
and O
offer O
to O
come O
again, O
but O
it's O
on O
duty! O

Overall, O
it's O
a O
great O
impression O
from O
this O
place. B-TARGET

I O
hope O
we O
get O
out O
of O
here O
with O
a O
bigger O
company! O

In O
April, O
she O
celebrated O
her O
MD O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

Everyone O
was O
very O
happy. O

We O
were O
lucky O
- O
there O
weren't O
many O
visitors O
in O
the O
restaurant O
at O
the O
time, O
so O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
(although O
I O
think O
we O
were O
served O
by O
the O
administrator) B-TARGET
was O
only O
given O
to O
us. O

I O
liked O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
much O
- O
professional, O
non-addictive, O
friendly. O

Help O
with O
the O
choice, O
set O
up O
a O
table O
with O
cold O
snacks. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious! O

Shablyk B-TARGET
is O
above O
all O
praise. O

The O
situation, B-TARGET
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy. O

The O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
perfect! O

The O
first O
months O
after O
the O
opening, O
they O
just O
couldn't O
be O
happy O
about O
a O
place B-TARGET
like O
this. O

And O
it's O
fun O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
your O
friends O
and O
the O
young O
man. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
meal B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

I've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
a O
week. O

Now O
it's O
all O
gone O
wrong. O

It's O
been O
awful O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
all O
the O
time. O

The O
service B-TARGET
fell O
sharply. O

Last O
time, O
we O
didn't O
even O
wipe O
the O
table O
after O
the O
previous O
visitors. O

Very O
often, O
there O
is O
nothing O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
(although O
it O
has O
never O
been) O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
has O
deteriorated O
in O
my O
opinion. O

But O
the O
prices O
are O
still O
at O
the O
same O
level. O

Anyway, O
this O
place B-TARGET
isn't O
happy O
anymore. O

It O
was O
at O
this O
place O
on O
10.09.08. O
They O
stopped O
by O
with O
their O
husband O
after O
work. O
They O
found O
a O
good O
name, O
but O
it O
was O
so O
artistic O
that O
they O
just O
couldn't O
get O
it O
out.) O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
little O
cozy, O
but O
it's O
more O
a O
cafe O
than O
a O
restaurant. O

Two O
floors B-TARGET
- O
on O
the O
second O
much O
more O
cozy O
) O
we O
were O
met, O
stripped, O
led O
and O
placed O
) O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
to O
the O
closet B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
bartender I-TARGET
in O
one O
person, O
handsome O
and O
friendly O
African-American B-TARGET
) O

Tried O
the O
different O
rolls, B-TARGET
cooked O
them O
very O
quickly O
for O
5-10 O
minutes, O
especially O
the O
delicious O
baked O
and O
philadelphia B-TARGET
beda O
is O
good, O
but O
I O
didn't O
understand O
why O
the O
rolls B-TARGET
were O
where O
5, O
where, O
6, O
and O
where O
7 O
)) O

The O
price O
tag O
in O
this O
place, B-TARGET
I O
think, O
is O
a O
restaurant, O
although O
maybe O
it's O
because O
the O
rolls B-TARGET
are O
pretty O
big. O

In O
general, O
I O
enjoyed O
a O
very O
large O
choice O
of O
sushi, B-TARGET
rolls, B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
soup B-TARGET
and O
other O
hot B-TARGET
meals. I-TARGET

But O
I'm O
not O
coming O
here O
anymore, O
because O
there O
are O
places O
where O
sushi O
is O
better O
prepared O
and O
more O
thorough. O

I O
just O
got O
from O
this O
place. O

I'd O
like O
to O
tell O
the O
others O
to O
keep O
a O
note... O

The B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
is O
cozy, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting O
and O
quality, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
brought O
the O
menu O
right O
away, O
came O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
order O
a O
few O
minutes O
later, O
brought O
the O
beer O
five O
minutes O
later, O
and O
then O
five O
more O
snacks, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
end O
of O
the O
good O
stuff. O

Then O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
like, O
went O
missing, O
didn't O
reach O
anything O
to O
order, O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
very O
long O
time, O
thought O
wrong, O
billed O
two O
more O
points O
than O
we O
ordered. O

And O
this O
waitress, B-TARGET
instead O
of O
being O
polite O
about O
it, O
was O
in O
Hamsky, O
ended O
up O
with O
a O
new O
account, O
with O
words, O
I O
don't O
know... O
I O
don't O
remember O
what O
you O
ordered, O
but O
if O
you'd O
be... O
short, O
messed O
up O
the O
mood... O
so O
I O
won't O
be O
coming O
back O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
any O
time O
soon. O

To O
be O
honest, O
several O
recent O
trips O
to O
Gorokhova O
have O
drawn O
attention O
to O
a O
new O
restaurant, O
according O
to O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Georgian O
kitchen. O

I O
was O
gonna O
come O
by O
every O
time, O
but O
somehow O
I O
couldn't... O

Finally, O
I O
specifically O
planned O
a O
weekend O
visit O
to O
Saperavi. O

Home: B-TARGET
From O
the O
street, O
the O
restaurant O
attracts O
a O
comfortable O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
a O
muffled B-TARGET
light. I-TARGET

It's O
getting O
even O
better O
when O
you O
get O
inside. O

Brick O
walls, O
good O
furniture, B-TARGET
modern O
interior... B-TARGET

Everything O
I O
love. O

It O
tastes O
like O
a O
dozen. O

Service B-TARGET
: O
We O
met O
nicely, O
hung O
clothes O
in O
the O
closet, O
drove O
them O
to O
the O
table. O

It's O
okay... O

Serviced O
quickly O
and O
qualitatively O
by O
recommending O
a O
course. O

They O
asked O
if O
they O
liked O
it. O

It's O
kind O
of O
nice O
and O
non-intrusive. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
trying, O
and O
I O
hope O
this O
continues. O

Kitchen: O
Hachapuri B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Ajar, I-TARGET
lots O
of O
cheese, B-TARGET
soft O
dough... B-TARGET
great. O

Salad B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
is O
a O
big O
meal, B-TARGET
an O
unusual O
gas O
station, B-TARGET
and O
I O
love O
it. O

Chicken O
salad B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
chef O
is O
nothing, O
unusual, O
but O
delicious. O

Tiramis B-TARGET
is O
above O
praise. O

Very O
gentle O
cream, B-TARGET
good O
impregnation. B-TARGET

In O
terms O
of O
price O
and O
quality, O
it's O
very O
good. O

It's O
a O
good O
thing O
you O
open O
restaurants B-TARGET
with O
quality O
kitchens B-TARGET
and O
good O
service, B-TARGET
no O
matter O
what. O

- O
Yes, O
of O
course, O
because O
so O
much O
of O
the O
menu O
is O
still O
untested) O

I O
wasn't O
fooled O
by O
my O
friends! O

As O
it O
was O
said, O
"The O
most O
delicious O
sushi B-TARGET
in O
the O
city," O
that's O
what O
happened. O

Place O
and O
interior: O
The O
restaurant O
is O
in O
the O
bedroom B-TARGET
area, I-TARGET
I O
wouldn't O
have O
gone O
to O
it O
myself, O
but O
it O
was O
on O
the O
way. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
neat, O
calm, O
comfortable. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
: O
Beautiful O
sushi, B-TARGET
fresh O
fish, B-TARGET
well O
cooked O
rice, B-TARGET
both O
baked O
and O
classic B-TARGET
sushi, I-TARGET
and O
roll B-TARGET
wonders O
are O
good. O

All O
portions B-TARGET
of O
an O
impressive O
size:) O

It's O
really O
good. O

And O
they O
also O
give O
you O
tasty O
cherries, B-TARGET
which O
isn't O
bad O
either. O

Service: B-TARGET
Fast, O
business, O
no O
mistakes. O

Prices O
are O
medium, O
land O
between O
55 O
rubles, O
rolls B-TARGET
up O
to O
600, O
drinks B-TARGET
aren't O
expensive. O

The O
general O
impression O
is O
nice. O

If O
you're O
in O
the O
area O
of O
the O
Lenin O
prospectus, O
it's O
the O
perfect O
place B-TARGET
for O
Japanese O
cuisine O
fans. O

I O
recommend O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
as O
a O
restaurant O
for O
dinner, O
dinner. O

The O
public O
is O
different, O
and O
the O
couples O
and O
the O
guys O
who O
came O
in O
for O
lunch O
on O
the O
block, O
the O
girlfriends O
and O
the O
moms O
with O
the O
kids. O

I'm O
not O
sure O
for O
romantic O
dates. O

I O
liked O
it. O
- O
1 O
for O
coffee, B-TARGET
it's O
not O
tasty. O

The O
general O
impression O
is O
nice. O

Thank O
you O
for O
your O
delicious O
lunch! O

Hey, O
everybody! O

We're O
from O
Moscow, O
visiting O
Peter O
and O
your O
wonderful O
restaurant B-TARGET
this O
weekend! O

I O
liked O
everything: O
and O
an O
unusual O
interior, B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
waitress B-TARGET
with O
a O
recommendation, O
a O
beautiful O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window, O
and O
the O
most O
important O
very O
good O
kitchen!!! B-TARGET

The O
price O
is O
completely O
consistent O
with O
the O
quality, O
and O
it's O
delicious, O
which O
I O
think O
is O
rare O
for O
Peter, O
where O
there O
are O
few O
really O
good O
restaurants. O
"BELLINI" B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
them! O

Next O
time O
we're O
in O
Peter, O
we'll O
be O
at O
your O
place, O
thank O
you! O

On O
Friday, O
8th O
and O
friends O
passed O
by O
the O
restaurant O
and O
saw O
a O
big O
sign O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
and O
see O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
Olympics. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
be O
surprised O
by O
the O
prostate O
of O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
(thanks O
to O
the O
great O
chef), O
the O
large O
choice O
of O
snacks B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
the O
beer. O

They O
especially O
liked O
"halapen B-TARGET
peppers," I-TARGET
which O
seems O
to O
be O
called O
an O
incredible O
dish, O
moderate O
prices, O
large O
portions. B-TARGET

A O
few O
restaurants O
in O
a O
town O
where O
it's O
so O
delicious O
it's O
not O
expensive O
to O
eat!!!!! O

Nicely O
surprised O
the O
maintenance B-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

The O
girl B-TARGET
who O
served O
us, O
with O
the O
rare O
name O
Antonina, O
is O
well O
versed O
in O
restaurant O
food O
and O
has O
been O
able O
to O
recommend O
appetizers O
to O
us. O

What O
a O
beer!! B-TARGET

They're O
about O
10 O
varieties O
for O
any O
taste. O

The O
bartender B-TARGET
just O
became O
our O
friend. O

Any O
question O
about O
beer, O
he's O
been O
able O
to O
pick O
up O
beer B-TARGET
for O
each O
and O
every O
one O
of O
us. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful O
in O
this O
beer B-TARGET
bar!!!!! I-TARGET

Everyone, O
Grossenstrasse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! B-TARGET

Until O
recently, O
regular O
visits O
were O
made O
to O
the O
facility O
with O
colleagues. O

But O
lately, O
both O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
have O
deteriorated: O
the O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
so O
salty O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
eat O
it, O
the O
cake O
for O
the O
first O
meal O
was O
served O
after O
the O
first O
one O
was O
eaten. O

And O
today O
they O
ordered O
a O
cocktail. O

It's O
from O
the O
private O
menu, O
no O
brilliance. O

20 O
minutes O
later, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
asked O
Love O
if O
the O
soup O
would O
be O
served O
soon. O

The O
answer O
is O
in O
three O
to O
five O
minutes. O

It's O
been O
10 O
more. O

They O
gave O
up O
soup O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
review O
book. O

The O
book O
was O
brought O
quite O
quickly, O
and O
five O
minutes O
later O
it O
was O
soup, O
which O
no O
longer O
wanted O
to O
eat. O

Asked O
to O
come O
to O
us O
or O
the O
manager B-TARGET
or O
other O
administrator. B-TARGET

Five O
minutes O
later, O
a O
girl B-TARGET
came O
and O
asked O
about O
our O
claims. O

Our O
comment O
that O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
about O
half O
an O
hour O
for O
a O
soup O
was O
followed O
not O
by O
an O
apology, O
but O
by O
the O
phrase O
that O
there O
were O
many O
customers. O

For O
a O
restaurant O
of O
this O
level, O
it O
is O
not O
permissible O
for O
staff B-TARGET
to O
be O
puffed O
up O
and O
non-implemented O
to O
affect O
the O
overall O
impression O
of O
the O
establishment. B-TARGET

Of O
all O
the O
restaurants O
I O
visited O
in O
Chinese O
kitchens, O
Tan B-TARGET
Wife I-TARGET
on O
peas O
is O
my O
favorite. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
for O
good, O
good O
and O
just O
to O
eat. O

You're O
not O
gonna O
have O
an O
expensive, O
luxurious O
interior O
and O
an O
elaborate O
menu. O

But O
you're O
gonna O
get O
a O
great O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
a O
quick, O
quality O
service. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
doesn't O
get O
worse O
year O
after O
year, O
which O
I O
can't O
help O
but O
rejoice O
at. O

Despite O
their O
rabid O
popularity, O
owners O
keep O
a O
stamp O
and O
do O
not O
allow O
themselves O
to O
save O
on O
the O
quality O
of O
food. B-TARGET

Moreover, O
even O
when O
the O
room O
is O
full O
(which O
is O
99.9% O
of O
the O
time), O
you O
will O
not O
wait O
for O
a O
menu O
or O
waiter B-TARGET
for O
more O
than O
two O
minutes. O

A O
simple O
example: O
February O
14th, O
in O
a O
full O
anchlague, O
from O
the O
moment O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table O
to O
the O
moment O
we O
were O
brought O
out O
of O
the O
first O
course, O
it O
was O
15 O
minutes O
ago. O

And O
it O
was O
delicious. O

Not O
even O
like O
that. O

WOMAN. O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
you O
have O
to O
make O
a O
reservation. O

I O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
thinking O
about O
where O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O

The O
choice O
was O
at O
the O
Ascalibur O
restaurant. O

And O
I O
wasn't O
wrong. O

She O
booked O
a O
table, O
talked O
about O
all O
the O
nuances O
of O
the O
event. O

And O
on O
May O
31st, O
we O
went O
to O
this O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
with O
our O
friends! O

Everyone O
loved O
it! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
medieval O
castle, O
the O
environment, B-TARGET
the O
service B-TARGET
exceeded O
all O
expectations. O

The O
prices O
are O
acceptable, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
original, O
they're O
tasty, O
and O
most O
importantly, O
they're O
delicious, O
they're B-TARGET
good. O

I O
could O
see O
all O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
fresh! O

In O
every O
dish, B-TARGET
you O
notice O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
his O
author. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleased: O
the O
administrators B-TARGET
of O
Elena, O
Marina, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
of O
Nikolai. O

I'd O
like O
to O
celebrate O
the O
kind, O
polite, O
careful, O
but O
non-intrusive O
service! B-TARGET

All O
my O
wishes O
for O
the O
organization O
and O
celebration O
of O
my O
holiday O
have O
been O
taken O
into O
account, O
which O
means O
I O
didn't O
have O
to O
run O
and O
remind O
you. O

We're O
gone O
full O
and O
happy O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
pleasant O
impressions! O

I'll O
also O
note O
as O
a O
person O
who's O
attracted O
to O
the O
picture O
that O
the O
pictures O
in O
the O
background O
of O
this O
wonderful O
medieval O
interior B-TARGET
are O
fantastic! O

The O
color, B-TARGET
the O
light, B-TARGET
the O
design B-TARGET
of O
the O
walls-- O
everything's O
very O
combined. O

There's O
still O
a O
feeling O
that O
we've O
been O
to O
another O
time, O
another O
dimension. O

I O
suggest O
you O
all! O

The O
first O
time O
we O
visited O
this O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
friends O
was O
two O
months O
ago. O

Impressive B-TARGET
everything! I-TARGET

Tasty O
beer B-TARGET
(especially O
juicy O
:) O
and O
a O
bitch B-TARGET
to O
it O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
snack O
:), O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
friendly O
staff! B-TARGET

The O
miniaturous O
girl B-TARGET
(I O
think O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
administrator) I-TARGET
is O
a O
high-ranking O
professional O
in O
her O
business: O
non-addictive O
service, B-TARGET
friendly O
approach B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
visitors, I-TARGET
care-giving O
to B-TARGET
clients. I-TARGET

This O
is O
a O
pleasant O
impression O
of O
the O
level O
of O
European O
service O
you O
rarely O
get O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Neve. O

Although O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
places O
like O
this O
in O
the O
city, O
it's O
not O
the O
only O
place O
you O
want O
to O
visit... O

Thank O
you O
very O
much!!!! O

I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
anniversary O
by O
inviting O
groups O
of O
friends O
from O
small O
companies. O

She O
took O
the O
action O
on O
myfant.ru O
very O
pleased O
that O
she O
chose O
the B-TARGET
East I-TARGET
Express. I-TARGET

It's O
the O
perfect O
place B-TARGET
to O
sit O
and O
hang O
out O
in O
a O
comfortable O
environment B-TARGET
for O
people O
who O
aren't O
very O
young. O

All O
three O
times O
in O
the O
smoking O
room-- O
very O
nice O
and O
comfortable O
couch-room. B-TARGET

Good O
ventilation B-TARGET
and O
less O
people. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
and O
maintenance-- B-TARGET
everything O
was O
very O
good O
for O
me O
and O
my O
guests. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

I'd O
love O
to O
come O
without O
the O
stock. O

From O
the O
dishes O
I O
took, O
the O
best O
thing O
I O
liked O
was O
the O
Caucasian B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
the O
soft O
one O
with O
the O
original O
grapefruit B-TARGET
sour. I-TARGET

Lettuce O
salad, B-TARGET
too, O
was O
good O
from O
the O
hot O
ones O
taking O
Dorada B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
vegetables. O

Delicious O
- O
original O
served O
with O
vegetable B-TARGET
garnish. I-TARGET

A O
trout B-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
parsley I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
a O
tasty, O
light O
and O
beautifully O
crafted O
dish. B-TARGET

I O
wanted O
to O
try O
the O
cheburetches. O

Got O
one O
shot O
(two O
large O
chebureks) O
for O
four. O

Tartar O
sauce O
to O
them. O

Light O
thin O
dough, B-TARGET
juicy O
meat B-TARGET
is O
fine. O

Morse B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
a O
natural O
cranberry, O
like O
home O
cranberry. O

For O
dessert, O
they O
took O
cherry B-TARGET
strudel I-TARGET
(a O
lot O
of O
cherry B-TARGET
with O
an O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
ball), O
hot O
apple B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
(also O
liked), O
strawberry B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
- O
I O
think O
a O
panacote B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
strawberry I-TARGET
mashed O
potatoes, O
(cheese O
and O
tasty) O

So O
we O
had O
a O
great O
time O
and O
had O
a O
good O
meal O
at O
this O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

There O
weren't O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
there O
on O
Saturday. O

It's O
a O
nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
live B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

They O
ordered O
a O
peckinese B-TARGET
duck I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
in O
the O
afternoon, O
and O
they O
enjoyed O
the O
meal B-TARGET
tonight. O

The O
overall O
impression O
is O
a O
great O
place, B-TARGET
of O
course O
there O
are O
a O
few O
shortcomings: O
tea O
was O
brought O
at O
the O
beginning O
(the O
girl B-TARGET
was O
asked O
to O
stop O
from O
performing O
the O
teasing O
ceremony, O
but O
apparently O
she O
doesn't O
speak O
Russian O
at O
all O
:) O
), O
slices B-TARGET
aren't O
as O
huge O
as O
they O
usually O
are O
in O
Chinese O
restaurants O
(especially O
rice O
- O
nowhere O
else. O
)) O
and O
the O
soup B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
duck O
has O
never O
been O
brought. O

Other O
than O
that, O
everything's O
fine: O
the O
girl B-TARGET
administrator I-TARGET
(helped O
us O
make O
the O
choice O
of O
food), O
the O
comfortable O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
not O
smoked, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
fast, O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
thoughtful, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

In O
general, O
a O
decent O
Chinese B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
food O
is O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
we O
say O
at O
Harbin, O
but O
the O
restaurant O
is O
worth O
it. O

He O
could O
be O
recommended O
for O
a O
visit O
next O
time. O

Thank O
you. O

The O
first O
time O
was O
in O
Aragvi O
in O
February. O

The O
company O
was O
big, O
the O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance. O

It's O
all O
very O
nice O
- O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
maintenance, B-TARGET
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
- O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
become O
a O
favourite O
place, O
so O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
we O
go O
over O
there. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
with O
a O
friend O
was O
April O
16th. O

Just O
in O
case O
a O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance. O

Despite O
the O
day O
off, O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
busy, O
so O
the O
reservation O
was O
very O
appropriate. O

It's O
delicious O
to O
cook O
in O
Aragvi, O
but O
it O
doesn't O
take O
long O
to O
wait O
for O
food. B-TARGET

They O
ordered O
greens B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables, I-TARGET
so O
they O
brought O
this O
good O
stuff O
to O
a O
basket.) O

Someone O
likes O
veal, O
some O
pork. O

It's O
really O
good, O
huh? O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
a O
little O
bit, O
but O
they're O
very O
tasty, O
too. O

We O
tried O
light O
dessert O
and O
baked O
pear, O
and O
it's O
too O
bad O
there's O
no O
Georgian B-TARGET
wine... I-TARGET
but O
they're O
nowhere. O

The B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant O
is O
small, O
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
is O
open O
to O
communication. O

So O
if O
you O
need O
a O
quiet, O
pleasant O
place O
to O
eat, O
aragvi B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
option! O
Come, O
you O
won't O
regret O
it! O

I O
read O
negative O
reviews O
about O
this O
restaurant, O
but O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
so O
I O
found O
them O
exaggerated. O

I'll O
tell O
you O
now, O
on O
my O
own O
experience, O
there's O
just O
no O
service B-TARGET
as O
such. O

The O
order O
was O
long O
overdue, O
and O
three O
tables O
were O
occupied O
in O
the O
huge O
room O
(!) O

Next O
up, O
we're O
waiting O
for O
drinks. O

One O
of O
the O
juices O
was O
brought, O
but O
the O
orange B-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
was O
not O
(!), O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
specified O
which O
to O
replace O
and O
left. O

We O
wait O
10 O
or O
15 O
minutes O
to O
drink. O

It O
wasn't O
until O
we O
got O
to O
the O
bar O
and O
brought O
the O
juice O
back. O

Later O
they O
brought O
food. O

There's O
no O
napkins O
on O
the O
table, O
no O
spice, O
they O
just O
didn't O
come O
in. O

They O
made O
signs O
again. O

The O
food B-TARGET
didn't O
like O
it. O

Inconformance O
of O
price O
and O
quality. O

It's O
pretty, O
but O
it's O
not O
very O
good. O

All O
I O
liked O
was O
coffee. B-TARGET

There O
were O
no O
cakes B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu. O

They O
left O
disappointed, O
lost O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half, O
but O
they O
didn't O
enjoy O
it. O

I've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
because O
I O
love O
Chinese O
food O
very O
much, O
and O
my O
husband O
prefers O
Japanese. O

I O
think O
it's O
perfect. O

They've O
been O
here O
for O
a O
long O
time. O
They're O
here O
by O
nightfall. O

Of O
course, O
everyone's O
tired O
at O
11:00 O
P.M. O

The B-TARGET
waitress, I-TARGET
as O
if O
under O
light O
drugs O
she O
hadn't O
listened O
carefully O
or O
recorded O
anything, O
brought O
the O
wrong O
dish O
after O
25 O
minutes O
of O
waiting. O

Negative. O

Time O
was O
late O
and O
we O
couldn't O
eat O
much, O
but O
we O
didn't O
find O
one O
really O
good O
thing O
when O
we O
said O
three O
dishes B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Chinese I-TARGET
and O
two O
in O
Japanese. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
claimable O
and O
not O
tasty. O

Besides, O
the O
account O
already O
includes O
tips, O
which O
is O
10%, O
and O
I O
didn't O
give O
2x O
for O
that O
service. B-TARGET

On O
the O
positive O
side, O
only O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

But O
very O
uncomfortable O
furniture. B-TARGET

Anyway, O
we're O
not O
going O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
anymore. O

We O
loved O
everything!!! O

It's O
a O
very O
nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

A O
beautiful O
feast B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
a O
good O
kitchen, B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
democratic O
price. O

Delicious O
barbecue, B-TARGET
good O
range B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

It's O
been O
celebrated O
with O
friends O
and O
family O
New O
Year's O
Eve. O

It O
was O
really O
fun! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
positive O
at O
home O
because O
it's O
comfortable O
and O
friendly. O

Interesting O
entertainment B-TARGET
program I-TARGET
and O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much!!!! O

We're O
celebrating O
your O
new O
year O
now O
we're O
gonna O
come O
by O
more O
often. O

It O
was O
January O
18th, O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
boring, O
but O
it O
was O
wrong. O

It O
was O
like O
the O
new O
year O
at O
the O
highest O
level, O
and O
the O
musicians B-TARGET
wouldn't O
miss O
it. O

Nice O
squid B-TARGET
at O
affordable O
prices. O

I'll O
bet O
five O
out O
of O
five, O
and O
I'll O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
for O
a O
break O
with O
friends O
and O
family. O

First O
time O
I O
came O
by O
by O
by O
accident, O
I O
wanted O
a O
coffee... O

It O
was O
immediately O
charmed O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
to O
meet O
you O
as O
if O
you O
were O
the O
one O
who O
was O
waiting O
and O
very O
happy O
to O
be O
here. O

The B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
cakes B-TARGET
are O
great. O

Then O
we O
came O
in O
a O
few O
times O
with O
friends, O
sit O
down, O
have O
a O
beer. O

The O
choice O
of O
beer B-TARGET
is O
small, O
but O
it's O
okay O
after O
all, O
it's O
more O
of O
a O
candy O
shop... O

Although O
everyone O
has O
found O
a O
tasteful O
drink, B-TARGET
there O
are O
Timmermans B-TARGET
and O
Neves. B-TARGET

I O
love O
the O
snacks, B-TARGET
the O
fried B-TARGET
wings, I-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
squid. B-TARGET

They're O
served O
with O
rings O
of O
onions. O

The O
truth O
is, O
without O
the O
sauce, B-TARGET
we O
didn't O
find O
the O
sauce O
on O
the O
menu O
either, O
but O
a O
nice O
waitress B-TARGET
on O
our O
question O
about O
the O
sauce, O
offered O
two O
kinds O
and O
immediately O
brought O
it. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
isn't O
bad, O
it's O
pathetic O
just O
that O
the O
couches O
and O
the O
plasma O
panel O
are O
only O
in O
the O
non-smoker O
room. O

10:00, O
it's O
on O
time, O
it's O
nice O
and O
it's O
smiley. O

It's O
great O
to O
have O
such O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
in O
our O
neighborhood. O

He O
brought O
a O
friend O
to O
the O
restaurant. O
He O
had O
an O
appointment O
there. O

It O
was O
tonight, O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
saw O
was O
a O
polite O
staff. B-TARGET

With O
a O
smile, O
they O
opened O
the O
door, O
offered O
to O
leave O
the O
coat, O
quickly O
brought O
the O
menu, O
and O
also O
quickly O
came O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
order O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
had O
chosen O
what O
I O
wanted O
(and O
how O
did O
they O
understand?). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
in O
nice O
light O
tones, O
and O
there O
are O
comfortable O
(interesting) O
tables B-TARGET
near O
the O
walls, O
but O
the O
places B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
center O
of O
the O
restaurant O
are O
a O
little O
disappointing O
because O
they're O
very O
uncomfortable. O

The O
order O
was O
delivered O
very O
quickly O
and O
the O
cooking O
was O
good O
and O
delicious. O

The O
lines B-TARGET
are O
medium, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
well-formed. O

So O
there's O
only O
good O
impressions O
left O
of O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
to O
La B-TARGET
Fabrik's I-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
for O
a O
pleasant O
evening!) O

We O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
on O
March O
10th. O

The O
impressions O
remain O
the O
most O
wonderful. O

I've O
been O
reading O
earlier O
reviews. O

I O
don't O
know, O
but O
I O
think O
it's O
a O
competition. O

It's O
not O
the O
first O
time O
I've O
been O
on O
the O
webboard O
myself, O
and O
it's O
always O
a O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
kitchen. B-TARGET

There's O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
beer, B-TARGET
it's O
above O
praise! O

Yeah, O
also O
about O
the O
tables... O
we've O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
his O
order... O

This O
time O
was O
ordered O
at O
all O
on O
the O
same O
day. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
polite, O
no O
one's O
been O
makin' O
us O
or O
counting O
us. O

Our O
table O
was O
served O
by O
Maria, O
once O
again O
I O
want O
to O
thank O
her O
very O
much! O

That's O
a O
very O
nice O
girl! B-TARGET

We've O
never O
had O
more O
than O
two O
eagles O
in O
an O
ashtray O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
at O
that O
frequency, O
she O
changed O
them. O

She O
was O
very O
kind, O
and O
she O
came O
to O
us O
to O
see O
if O
there O
was O
anything O
else O
she O
needed. O

And O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
it O
didn't O
seem O
so O
obsessive. O

15 O
minutes O
after O
the O
order, O
we O
didn't O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
that O
fast! O

Anyway, O
the O
impressions O
are O
the O
most O
positive! O

We'll O
have O
to O
come O
here O
again! O

The O
restaurant O
is O
for O
me O
first O
of O
all O
the O
kitchen, O
then O
the O
maintenance, O
and O
then O
the O
interior O
and O
the O
location. O

I O
went O
to O
it O
again O
yesterday, O
and O
I O
realized O
if O
you O
want O
a O
free-riding O
option, O
you O
have O
to O
come O
here. O

There O
are O
many O
places O
open O
and O
closed O
in O
the O
city. O

What O
surprises O
me O
about O
this O
is O
that O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
(quality) O
hasn't O
changed O
since O
8 O
years!!!!!!!! O

It's O
expensive. O

They're B-TARGET
big O
and O
they're O
very O
full. O

The B-TARGET
quality I-TARGET
of O
the O
meat O
is O
excellent. O

They're O
cooking O
fast, O
but O
they're O
good! O

So O
it's O
five O
foods. B-TARGET

The O
interior? O

In O
general, O
I O
like O
him. O

It's O
pretty O
stylish, O
it's O
very O
good-looking. O

The O
only O
thing O
is, O
I'd O
still O
hang O
the O
big B-TARGET
windows I-TARGET
that O
go O
out O
on O
Nekrasov, O
some O
kind O
of O
semi-translucent O
seal. O

Big O
window O
openings B-TARGET
look O
a O
little O
holo. O

I'd O
bet O
a O
four. O

It's O
okay, O
quick, O
but O
you O
can O
see O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
aren't O
pros. O

It O
doesn't O
bother O
me O
personally. O

It O
struck O
me O
that O
every O
visitor O
changes O
a O
white O
tablecloth O
even O
if O
it's O
completely O
clean. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
see O
you. O

Anyway, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

And O
you O
can O
eat, O
and O
you O
can O
talk, O
and O
you O
can O
bring O
the O
lady O
to O
celebrate O
her O
birthday. O

I've O
walked O
and O
I'll O
walk. O

We O
stopped O
by O
for O
dinner O
at O
11 O
p.m. O
on O
Friday, O
17.01.14. O

The O
parker B-TARGET
met O
us O
first, O
helped O
us O
park O
and O
even O
opened O
the O
doors O
and O
politely O
welcomed O
us. O

I O
like O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
I O
like O
the O
design. B-TARGET

It's O
simple O
and O
tasteful, O
a O
lot O
of O
interesting O
little O
things. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
nice O
girl. B-TARGET

Unfortunately, O
they O
didn't O
remember O
her O
name. O

She O
was O
careful O
and O
unaddictive O
and O
helped O
me O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
pasta O
by O
giving O
details O
of O
the O
composition O
and O
the O
way O
in O
which O
the O
meal O
was O
prepared. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant O
menu O
is O
big O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
magazine, O
there's O
anything... O
cookies, O
sushi, O
wax, O
pasta, O
etc. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
design I-TARGET
is O
interesting, O
designers O
are O
good! O

I O
ate O
white O
mushroom O
soup O
(approximately O
350 O
p.m.) O
and O
duck O
foam O
(450 O
p.m.). O

The O
soup B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
divine. O

Lots O
of O
sauce, B-TARGET
soft O
duck B-TARGET
meat. I-TARGET

I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
pasta.)) B-TARGET

My O
husband O
ate O
beef O
salad O
and O
carpaccho. O

We O
loved O
everything. O

We O
got O
positive O
emotions O
from O
the O
visit... O
talked O
and O
had O
a O
good O
meal! O

We'll O
come O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Thank O
the O
cooks B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
for O
their O
good O
emotions! O

Perhaps O
a O
"work O
on O
mistakes" O
was O
done, O
or O
perhaps O
we O
were O
just O
lucky;) O
on O
23 O
February, O
a O
friend O
visited O
the O
restaurant. O

It's O
probably O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
pickle, O
but O
there's O
not O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
said O
for O
it. O

Very O
polite O
waitresses B-TARGET
meeting O
all O
the O
guests O
at O
the O
entrance. O

We O
ordered O
the O
table O
in O
advance, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
problem O
with O
the O
places. O

Pleasant, O
having O
an O
interior, B-TARGET
comfortable O
sofas. B-TARGET

Maybe O
too O
soft-drowning, O
but O
for O
a O
relaxing O
evening O
at O
a O
pleasant O
company, O
that's O
what O
it O
is. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
who O
served O
our O
table O
(I O
don't O
know O
what O
our O
name O
is, O
unfortunately) O
- O
paying O
attention O
and O
warning O
- O
was O
happy O
to O
answer O
all O
our O
questions. O

The O
dirty O
dishes O
weren't O
kept O
on O
the O
table, O
the O
instruments O
were O
never O
reminded, O
the O
ashtray O
changed O
in O
the O
years. O

Amazingly O
good O
brand O
rolls, B-TARGET
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
(for O
a O
Japanese O
restaurant) O
big O
hot B-TARGET
ones. I-TARGET

In O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
there O
were O
no O
claims; O
perhaps O
the O
hottest O
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
faster O
-- O
but O
we O
didn't O
hurry, O
and O
a O
little O
delay O
in O
the O
smoothest O
part O
of O
the O
evening, O
in O
principle. O

In O
general, O
the O
impressions O
are O
positive, O
and O
I O
think O
we'll O
come O
even O
more, O
especially O
since O
we're O
living O
nearby. O

Good O
afternoon! O

I'm O
writing O
about O
our O
impressions O
of O
visiting O
this O
restaurant. O

You O
saw O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
ad O
in O
the O
restaurant O
yard O
and O
you O
decided O
to O
try... O
and O
you O
didn't O
regret O
it! O

Up O
to O
the O
4th O
floor O
of O
the O
Sports O
Club. O

The O
girl O
(the O
waiter) O
met O
at O
the O
entrance. O

I O
was O
at O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window, O
and O
they O
gave O
me O
the O
menu. O

There's O
not O
much O
blue B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
but O
there's O
something O
to O
choose O
from! O

Ordered: O
vegetable O
smoothies, O
cereal O
smoothies, O
tea O
kettles O
(such O
as O
multiphytes), O
salad O
with O
home O
cheese, O
shrimp O
hands, O
salmon O
with O
green O
asparagus, O
and O
tuna O
with O
grilled O
vegetables. O

We O
got O
a O
quick O
drink, O
right O
after O
the O
salad O
and O
the O
hot O
one. O

Everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
beautiful! O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
amazing: O
furniture, B-TARGET
appliances, B-TARGET
dishes, O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window, O
candles, B-TARGET
maintenance! B-TARGET

Well, O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
everything! O

Let O
us O
come O
to O
you O
again O
and O
advise O
our O
friends!!! O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
great! O

A O
very O
nice O
and O
polite O
staff, B-TARGET
already O
meeting O
at O
the O
entrance, O
feels O
like O
they've O
been O
waiting O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

It's O
a O
lot O
of B-TARGET
food, I-TARGET
it's O
good O
and O
fast. O

The O
drugs B-TARGET
are O
big, O
the O
ones O
that O
are O
packed O
with O
them. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
sound O
of O
quiet O
and O
quiet O
music, B-TARGET
a O
very O
relaxing O
environment. B-TARGET

Terrific O
interior, B-TARGET
like O
you're O
in O
a O
fairy O
tale. O

I O
remember O
the O
night O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

Thank O
you! O

Nice O
place! B-TARGET

My O
wife O
and O
I O
had O
our O
wedding O
anniversary, O
and O
we O
always O
go O
to O
a O
new O
restaurant O
on O
that O
day. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Peter, O
but O
this O
time O
our O
choice O
fell O
to O
Legran. O

We've O
heard O
too O
much O
good O
about O
him. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
it O
was O
a O
wonderful O
evening, O
the O
chef's B-TARGET
honor! O

Everything O
was O
incredibly O
delicious O
and O
original! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is, O
of O
course, O
astounding O
at O
once, O
everyone O
on O
the O
street O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
tree B-TARGET
and O
tycoon, B-TARGET
lanterns B-TARGET
of O
the O
New O
Year's O
mood, O
cozy O
and O
fancy O
inside, O
soft O
couchs, B-TARGET
candles, B-TARGET
white B-TARGET
piano. I-TARGET

For O
our O
case, O
it's O
just O
100% O
hit, O
there O
was O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
that O
night, O
a O
pianist B-TARGET
playing O
the O
white O
piano. O

It's O
beautiful! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
can O
tell O
me O
how O
happy O
I O
am, O
and O
the O
smiling O
hostess B-TARGET
met O
us O
at O
the O
entrance, O
and O
that's O
how O
it O
was O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening! O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
thoughtful O
and O
polite, O
too, O
and O
I O
can't O
remember O
a O
time O
when O
we O
don't O
like O
something! O

In O
general, O
a O
great O
restaurant, B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
to O
everyone, O
and O
I'd O
love O
to O
go O
back O
there O
myself. O

Thank O
you! O

In O
general, O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
like O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
very O
much, O
the O
service B-TARGET
there O
is O
good, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
the O
administrators B-TARGET
always O
try O
to O
help. O

I O
can't O
tell O
you O
anything O
about O
security-- O
we O
haven't O
noticed O
them O
since O
they O
beat O
someone O
up, O
we've O
never O
been O
there O
(we've O
been O
to O
a O
restaurant O
almost O
every O
week). O

It's O
a O
good O
thing O
that O
at O
night, O
around O
9:00, O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
plays, O
you O
can O
dance O
and O
have O
a O
good O
time. O

The O
public O
is O
decent, O
the O
prices O
are O
moderate, O
their O
own O
brewery B-TARGET
produces O
fine O
wheat B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
pitch I-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
snacks B-TARGET
are O
also O
very O
good, O
tasty O
cheese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
plate, I-TARGET
and O
excellent O
milk B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
alcohol I-TARGET
cocktails. I-TARGET

In O
general, O
a O
very O
good, O
decent O
establishment, B-TARGET
the O
truth O
is, O
Thursday, O
Friday O
and O
weekend O
tables O
have O
to O
be O
booked O
in O
about O
three O
weeks. O

But O
anyway, O
I O
recommend O
you O
visit O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
you O
won't O
regret O
it! O

Hey. O

I've O
been O
celebrating O
my O
birthday O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
first O
thing O
we O
liked O
when O
we O
went O
into O
the O
restaurant... O
was O
that O
we O
heard O
I O
booked O
a O
table. O

The O
second B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
is O
just O
some O
kind O
of O
paradise. O

A O
very O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
so O
tender O
and O
cozy. O

For O
that, O
10 O
with O
a O
plus!!! O

Next O
thing O
I O
know... O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
diverse, O
all O
tastes, O
but O
when O
I O
look O
at O
it O
in O
detail, O
I O
end O
up O
with O
fish, O
because O
I O
don't O
like O
anything O
else. O
(Pizza O
can O
be O
eaten O
in O
other, O
more O
specialized O
places, O
pasta... O
that's O
what O
I'm O
gonna O
do O
at O
home, O
soup... O
not O
for O
a O
holiday.) O

The O
price O
of O
wine B-TARGET
is O
just O
rabid... O
though O
it O
may O
be O
normal O
for O
a O
restaurant O
like O
this, O
but O
in O
terms O
of O
food, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
expensive! O

In O
general, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
closer O
to O
Italian, O
but O
there's O
something O
super O
faeric O
I O
haven't O
seen, O
so O
it's O
only O
eight. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
concerned, O
I'm O
saying O
that O
there's O
no O
further O
claim O
from O
the O
person O
reading, O
the O
plates O
were O
cleaned O
on O
time, O
but O
the O
girls B-TARGET
weren't O
interested O
in O
us O
either. O

There O
wasn't O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

We O
sat O
in O
seven, O
left O
five O
thousand, O
but O
we O
didn't O
get O
any O
service O
satisfaction B-TARGET
and O
reception, B-TARGET
although O
it O
was O
delicious, O
beautifully O
served O
and O
decorated. O

There's O
only O
six O
to O
service. B-TARGET

Yesterday, O
we O
were O
at O
the O
sky O
restaurant, O
which O
I O
can O
tell O
you, O
I'm O
gonna O
go O
over O
items O
1. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
particularly O
sushi, B-TARGET
rolls, B-TARGET
pork B-TARGET
sash, I-TARGET
warm B-TARGET
Mexican I-TARGET
salad!!!! I-TARGET

It's O
a O
little O
uncomfortable, O
from O
the O
big B-TARGET
space I-TARGET
and O
a O
little O
chilly O
in O
the O
winter, O
but O
in O
the O
summer O
it's O
super-views B-TARGET
out I-TARGET
of O
the O
window!! O

Service, B-TARGET
I O
think O
it's O
very O
good, O
from O
guest B-TARGET
to O
wire. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
polite O
(especially O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
Anastasia), O
friendly O
and O
well O
aware O
of O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
meal, O
which O
is O
not O
insignificant. O

In O
general, O
it's O
a O
very O
nice O
impression!!! O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone!! O

On O
Saturday, O
24 O
November, O
when O
people O
would O
be O
busy, O
they O
had O
a O
table O
set O
in O
advance O
for O
10 O
people. O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
tables O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
people O
could O
be O
found. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
chosen O
for O
the O
reasons O
that O
there O
was O
room O
and O
opportunity O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
large O
company, O
and O
still O
a O
familiar O
place. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
but O
maybe O
it's O
okay O
for O
that O
kind O
of O
enviousness. O

Terriblely O
stoned, O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
they O
feel O
about O
air O
conditioners, B-TARGET
which O
means O
there's O
a O
children's O
room O
and O
a O
children's O
menu O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
should O
at O
least O
make O
a O
separate O
area O
for O
those O
who O
smoke. O

I O
really O
liked O
Dor-brew's B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
(tomatoes, O
cucumbers, O
peppers, O
fresh O
raw O
champignons, O
Dor-brew O
cheese, O
butter), O
the B-TARGET
branded I-TARGET
sausage I-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
for I-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
which, O
when O
served, O
torched, O
honestly O
thought O
that O
the O
specialty O
should O
be O
more O
axiistic. O

It O
was O
hot, O
but O
it O
didn't O
look O
like O
it. O

The O
music B-TARGET
plays O
loudly, O
so O
the B-TARGET
chicks I-TARGET
don't O
speak, O
and O
sometimes O
they O
don't O
hear O
the O
food O
for O
the O
order, O
you O
wait O
for O
50 O
minutes, O
and O
it O
turns O
out O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
another O
50 O
minutes O
(that's O
what O
the O
40-50-mine O
time O
says). O

The O
waitress's B-TARGET
girlfriend O
was O
always O
saying O
that O
she O
can't O
cook O
it O
faster O
than O
she O
can. O

Pretty O
good O
on O
the O
whole. O

We O
could O
come O
in O
for O
a O
beer B-TARGET
and O
sausages B-TARGET
tonight. O

It's O
better O
to O
have O
children O
by O
3:00 O
p.m., O
fewer O
people O
and O
children's O
holidays O
until O
then. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good!!!! O

I O
have O
a O
very O
trembling O
and O
important O
event O
with O
him... O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
my O
future O
husband O
proposed O
to O
me O
(by O
the O
way, O
the O
wedding O
is O
in O
a O
week O
and O
we'll O
only O
celebrate O
it O
there). O

Kitchen's B-TARGET
great, O
service's B-TARGET
10. O

I O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
menu O
like O
it O
usually O
does O
in O
some O
restaurants. O

We O
sat O
down, O
ordered O
Georgian O
dishes, O
champagne, O
five O
minutes O
later O
we O
got O
the O
most O
delicious O
champagne B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
had O
in O
my O
life. O

The O
order O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
too O
long, O
20 O
minutes, O
okay. O

We O
ate, O
we O
ate, O
and O
we O
couldn't O
enjoy O
the O
food, B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
so O
delicious, O
so O
unusual, O
because O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time O
I O
was O
in O
a O
Georgian O
restaurant. O

It's O
quiet, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
so O
quiet O
and O
east...)) O

I O
really O
don't O
remember O
her O
being O
alive, O
I O
don't O
think. O

We O
were O
there O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
and O
I O
know O
that O
there O
was O
a O
program O
coming O
up O
tonight. O

I O
loved O
it!!!!!!! O

If O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
restaurant O
for O
an O
important O
event, O
you O
can O
go O
to O
TBILISO!!! B-TARGET

If O
you O
don't O
like O
me, O
you O
can O
beat O
me O
up... O
(-)) O

Visited O
Yalta O
restaurant O
11.05.12 O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
birthday, O

had O
a O
table O
set O
up O
for O
eight O
people O
the O
day O
before O
the O
party, O

When O
we O
were O
ordered, O
we O
were O
shown O
a O
restaurant, O
offered O
a O
few O
options O
to O
accommodate O
our O
guests, O

We've O
chosen O
a O
separate O
two O
tables O
surrounded O
by O
couchs O
and O
chairs O
with O
a O
panoramic O
window, O

There O
was O
no O
advance O
payment O
for O
the O
order, O
which O
made O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
look O
good, O
considering O
that O
our O
event O
was O
scheduled O
for O
Friday O
night. O

The O
restaurant O
benefits O
from O
a O
calm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
pleasant, O
not O
loud, O
living B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
which O
leaves O
a O
chance O
for O
a O
pleasant O
conversation. O

The O
service B-TARGET
isn't O
obsessive, O
I'd O
say O
undetectable, O
very O
pleasant O
waiters B-TARGET
brought O
a O
vase O
for O
flowers, O
took O
an O
order, O
everything O
very O
polite, O
with O
a O
good O
knowledge B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
menu O
and O
good-will. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
variety, O
the O
good, O
the O
informative O
menu, B-TARGET
on O
which O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
choose O
a O
dish O
for O
all O
tastes, O
because O
it O
represented O
a O
Japanese, O
Russian, O
Georgian O
kitchen. O

It's B-TARGET
big, O
it's B-TARGET
nice, O
it O
tastes O
great. O

The O
check O
is O
a O
little O
higher O
than O
in O
other O
restaurants, O
this O
class, O
but O
our O
positive O
emotions O
were O
worth O
it. O

Have O
a O
really O
nice O
time, O
very O
happy O
to O
have O
chosen O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
happy O
to O
remain O
at O
the O
service B-TARGET
level O
and O
in O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

They O
stopped O
by O
on O
Saturday O
at O
5 O
p.m. O
in O
early O
December. O

Of O
course O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

The O
order O
was O
waiting O
for O
an O
hour, O
so O
even O
the O
salads O
weren't O
brought O
to O
us O
until O
an O
hour O
later, O
for O
some O
reason O
with O
the O
hot O
one. O

There O
was O
a O
mix-up O
at O
the O
next O
table, O
and O
after O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting, O
people O
didn't O
get O
what O
they O
wanted. O

Pasta, B-TARGET
risotto... B-TARGET
weren't O
bad. O

In O
principle, O
nothing O
outstanding, O
but O
we O
didn't O
expect O
anything, O
just O
came O
by O
for O
lunch. O

I O
didn't O
like O
the O
long O
wait O
and O
some O
sort O
of O
isolation O
of O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
just O
went O
outside O
to O
sit O
on O
a O
bench... O
while O
we O
wanted O
to O
pay O
off. O

I O
spent O
10 O
minutes O
talking O
to O
someone, O
and O
I O
finally O
came O
to O
us, O
but O
with O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
like O
that, O
don't O
wait O
to O
see O
if... O
the O
courtesy O
and O
the O
desire O
to O
serve O
the O
guests O
I O
didn't O
notice. O

Cozy, O
cozy, O
unlucky O
service. B-TARGET

The O
soup B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

I'll O
look O
in O
there O
for O
more O
tea O
and O
dessert O
if O
I O
walk O
by. O

I O
used O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
a O
lot, O
first O
of O
all, O
in O
a O
convenient O
place O
for O
me, O
second O
of O
all, O
there's O
a O
10% O
discount O
card. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good, O
I O
can't O
say O
anything, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
lately O
(from O
the O
beginning O
of O
summer) O
leave O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

Waitresses B-TARGET
are O
always O
forgetting O
something, O
with O
a O
small O
number O
of O
visitors, O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
40-50 O
minutes O
sometimes!!! O

Even O
though O
we O
don't O
take O
the O
hottest. O

Beer B-TARGET
spilled O
wasn't O
the O
same O
as O
no O
foam, O
no O
bubbles... O

That's O
why O
we're O
choosing O
other O
sushi O
bars... O

I O
hope O
the O
Wasabi B-TARGET
will O
change O
for O
the O
better O
again. O

Good O
luck. O

Anne. O

They O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
sit O
with O
a O
noisy O
company. O

Our O
choice O
was O
a O
new O
John O
Donne O
pub. O

Overall, O
the O
best O
impressions O
remain. O

During O
the O
pub, O
all O
employees B-TARGET
are O
friendly, O
followed O
by O
a O
lovely O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
offered O
us O
a O
couple O
of O
tables O
to O
choose. O

Almost O
immediately O
we O
were O
given O
a O
menu, O
informing O
us O
that O
the O
institution O
had O
a O
very O
interesting O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
since O
we O
were O
not O
familiar O
with O
the O
range O
of O
English O
beer, O
we O
were O
given O
comments O
on O
the O
positions O
of O
interest, O
and O
even O
brought O
a O
small O
amount O
to O
the O
sample, O
which O
is O
certainly O
a O
pleasure! O

We O
tried O
most O
of O
the O
beer O
row, O
everyone O
found O
beer B-TARGET
to O
taste. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
happy, O
a O
big O
beer B-TARGET
plate, I-TARGET
it O
was O
really O
big O
and O
delicious! O

Different O
appetizers B-TARGET
aren't O
common O
at O
all, O
like O
most O
places. O

From O
the O
hot O
meal, O
I O
can O
advise O
Fish B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Chips, I-TARGET
Strake B-TARGET
New I-TARGET
York. I-TARGET

But O
the O
minus O
is O
also O
present, O
and O
a O
colleague O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
wanted O
dessert O
and O
stopped O
her O
choice O
on O
the O
sorbet, B-TARGET
but O
when O
she O
found O
out O
that O
150 O
rubles O
gave O
her O
50 O
grs, O
one O
balloon O
was O
a O
little O
upset. O

It's O
expensive, O
though. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
nice O
for O
the O
pub, O
and O
football O
matches O
are O
broadcast O
on O
TV. O

All O
in O
all, O
a O
good, O
emotional O
environment. B-TARGET

We'll O
definitely O
come O
back O
again! O

There O
was O
a O
birthday O
party O
in O
this O
restaurant O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
Saturday O
night. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
express O
my O
great O
gratitude, O
first O
of O
all, O
to O
the O
management B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
which O
serves B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
and, O
of O
course, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
are O
preparing O
these O
delicious O
meals B-TARGET
for O
the O
visitors. O

I O
liked O
everything. O

Of O
course, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
impressive: O
cozy O
and O
beautiful. O

The O
table B-TARGET
was O
great. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
waiter B-TARGET
Bahram, O
thank O
him. O

I'd O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
at O
this O
level, O
the O
prices O
aren't O
high. O

We O
were O
with O
our O
husband, O
we O
wanted O
to O
celebrate O
our O
date, O
but! O

It O
took O
us O
15-20 O
minutes O
to O
wait O
in O
the O
wardrobe O
until O
we O
were O
invited O
inside, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
too O
late O
and O
when O
we O
came O
in, O
the O
room O
was O
half O
empty. O

Okay... O

Don't O
get O
nervous. O

It's O
kind O
of O
a O
holiday, O
though. O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
interesting. O

We O
order O
food, O
I O
don't O
remember O
the O
names O
(I'm O
a O
chicken, O
my O
husband O
wanted O
to O
try O
the O
horse). O

It's O
been O
hot B-TARGET
for O
10 O
minutes... O
fast, O
I O
don't O
argue, O
but O
in O
10 O
minutes, O
how O
can O
you O
make O
a O
horse? O

There O
was O
a O
feeling, O
both O
from O
the O
view O
and O
from O
the O
taste, O
that O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
had O
been O
standing O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
and O
had O
just O
been O
warmed O
up O
in O
the O
microwave. O

No O
salt, B-TARGET
no O
spice, B-TARGET
absolutely O
fresh O
food B-TARGET
(although O
I'm O
sure O
someone O
likes O
it, O
but O
waiters B-TARGET
could O
warn O
and O
put O
more O
spice O
on O
the O
table)! O

There's O
no O
way O
they're O
supported. O

They O
couldn't O
finish O
it. O

The O
mood O
was O
imported. O

The O
most O
edible O
is O
green B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
vegetable I-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
you O
know, O
it's O
hard O
to O
ruin. O

The O
prices O
are O
generally O
average, O
but O
in O
this O
kitchen, B-TARGET
they're O
totally O
unjustified. O

We're O
not O
gonna O
go O
there O
again O
for O
extra O
money. O

It's O
a O
normal O
place, B-TARGET
but O
I O
don't O
think O
it's O
"great." O

First O
of O
all, O
it's O
very O
noisy: O
the O
hall B-TARGET
is O
small, O
and O
when O
people O
talk O
all O
the O
time O
(and O
there O
were O
many O
visitors), O
there's O
such O
a O
humour O
that O
you O
can't O
hear O
what O
your O
satellites O
are O
talking O
about, O
sitting O
across O
from O
each O
other, O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
themselves O
are O
pretty O
close O
to O
each O
other. O

Second O
of O
all, O
it's O
pretty O
expensive. O

Third, O
the O
service: B-TARGET
it O
was O
very O
unpleasant O
to O
be O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
in O
the O
top O
clothes O
(all O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
running O
around O
the O
room, O
no O
one O
met O
and O
showed O
where O
the O
wardrobe O
was O
- O
he O
was O
a O
closet O
between O
the O
toilets:) O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
brought O
the O
dishes O
first O
and O
then O
the O
instruments, O
the O
bill O
was O
kept O
long O
enough O
when O
she O
left, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
wardrobe O
didn't O
give O
out O
all O
the O
jackets O
and O
left... O
the O
little O
things, O
but O
they O
gave O
the O
impression. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
and O
location B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
were O
nice. O

The B-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
wasn't O
bad, O
no O
complaints, O
tried O
truffle B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
rickotta I-TARGET
truffle O
truffles O
(380, O
p.p.) O
and O
parmesan B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
(380, O
p.) O
(so O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
cheapest O
dish O
on O
the O
menu:). O

The O
red O
"home" O
wine O
is O
260 O
rubles/boil. O

The O
check O
for O
four O
girls O
with O
wine O
was O
about O
6,000. O

Hello! O
23.12.2013. O

We O
had O
a O
company O
in O
Le B-TARGET
Glamure's I-TARGET
restaurant. O
It O
was O
very O
nice, O
I O
recommend! O

Great O
kitchen, B-TARGET
high-level O
service, B-TARGET
inside O
like O
a O
picture, O
I O
haven't O
seen O
such O
beauty O
in O
a O
long O
time. O

A O
very O
nice, O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Greetings O
of O
waiters, B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
beautiful O
interiors. B-TARGET

We're O
gonna O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
more O
than O
once! O

Separate O
thanks O
to O
Kata, O
our O
host B-TARGET
;) O

We O
celebrated O
a O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
19.04, O
and O
there O
were O
a O
few O
guests, O
only O
45 O
people, O
walking O
in O
the O
lower O
hall. O

The O
restaurant's B-TARGET
very O
nice, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
good O
for O
the O
eye, O
and O
second, O
the O
food O
was O
for O
the O
slaughter.)) O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
we O
took O
what O
was O
left O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
ate O
at O
home. O

From O
the O
menu O
we O
chose, O
I O
really O
liked O
Laguna B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
eggplants B-TARGET
and O
mushroom B-TARGET
rolls. I-TARGET

The O
hot O
meat O
and O
fish O
were O
50-50. O

I O
picked O
a O
trout B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
steak, I-TARGET
which O
I O
thought O
was O
juicy O
and O
delicious. O

Third, O
the O
staff's B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
and O
attitude O
are O
very O
friendly. O

We O
chose O
the O
Tamada O
offered O
by O
Dima's O
restaurant. O

He's O
a O
very O
fun O
and O
positive O
man, B-TARGET
a O
professional O
of O
his O
own. O

Thank O
him O
separately! O

The O
director B-TARGET
is O
a O
soul O
mate, O
taking O
all O
the O
wishes O
into O
account O
and O
advising O
on O
what O
and O
how O
best O
to O
do O
it. O

In O
the O
end, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
what O
we O
liked! O
We O
had O
a O
good O
rest, O
nothing O
ruined O
the O
mood, O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
misses, O
except O
for O
the O
little O
things O
that O
we O
understand O
are O
necessary. O

We O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Thank O
you! O

I O
think O
it's O
a O
very O
decent O
place. B-TARGET

Life's B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
made O
me O
very O
happy. O

We O
were O
at O
the O
Tonight O
concert. O

Amazing. O

Guys, B-TARGET
as O
it O
turns O
out, O
they O
can O
light O
up O
at O
100! O

I O
mean, O
the O
public B-TARGET
has O
been O
ripping O
off O
all O
night O
long, O
but O
thanks O
for O
the O
eo O
in O
person, O
even O
though O
the O
bar's B-TARGET
administration I-TARGET
has O
something O
to O
thank O
for-- O
the O
concert O
was O
completely O
free! O

It's O
also O
a O
very O
pixel O
bartender-- B-TARGET
it O
looks O
like O
a O
cartoon O
chef! O

I O
don't O
complain O
about O
the O
service B-TARGET
either, O
but O
it's O
not O
perfect O
yet. O

At O
the O
concert, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
couldn't O
wait O
to O
see O
the O
big O
somotoch O
around. O

Of O
course, O
I O
can't O
help O
but O
notice O
the O
beer. B-TARGET
I'd O
put O
a O
scale O
on O
it O
and O
put O
11 O
out O
of O
10. O
That's O
more O
than O
great! O

And O
the O
prices O
for O
a O
place B-TARGET
like O
this O
can't O
help O
but O
beer B-TARGET
from O
100 O
rubles. O

I'd O
like O
to O
say O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
administration. B-TARGET

Keep O
it O
going:) O

When O
you O
enter O
the O
restaurant, O
you O
meet O
an O
unusual O
interior, B-TARGET
a O
guard, O
and O
a O
friendly O
administrator. B-TARGET

Go O
to O
one O
of O
the O
four O
rooms, O
and O
then O
as O
usual, O
sit O
down, O
wait O
for O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
(he O
comes O
quickly O
enough), O
order O
food, O
and O
wait O
15 O
to O
20 O
minutes. O

The O
situation B-TARGET
at O
the O
restaurant O
is O
quite O
interesting. O

If O
you O
take O
the O
kitchen O
into O
account, O
it's O
gonna O
have O
to O
be: O
whole O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
but O
everything O
depends, O
probably, O
on O
the O
cook O
or O
his O
mood, O
on O
the O
swinging O
of O
the O
food O
itself O
or O
something O
else, O
I O
don't O
know... O
in O
general, O
having O
been O
in O
this O
restaurant O
a O
few O
times O
and O
ordering O
the O
same O
hot O
one, O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
because O
the O
first O
time O
I O
was O
brought O
a O
fancy O
meat B-TARGET
dish, I-TARGET
but O
for O
the O
second O
time, O
I, O
to O
say O
the O
least, O
I O
felt O
very O
sorry O
for O
ordering O
it: O
the B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
is O
hard, O
it O
doesn't O
chewing, O
the O
knife O
gets O
cut O
bad, O
and O
it's O
barely O
warm... O
darkness. O

It's O
not O
even O
a O
bad O
place. B-TARGET

Who O
wouldn't O
give O
it O
a O
shot? O

We O
came O
to O
Nelson's O
pub O
last O
week O
with O
friends O
to O
have O
a O
beer, O
we O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
staff's B-TARGET
welcome, O
so O
many O
friendly O
people O
we O
haven't O
seen O
yet! O

We O
were O
served O
by O
Eugenia's O
waitress, B-TARGET
we O
know O
her O
from O
another O
restaurant, O
a O
very O
good O
and O
kind O
girl, B-TARGET
who'll O
always O
tell O
us O
what O
to O
eat O
and O
what O
to O
drink. O

We O
drank O
beer B-TARGET
in O
this O
place, O
and O
we O
really O
liked O
it, O
and O
the O
beer B-TARGET
was O
fresh. O

They O
ordered O
pastes, B-TARGET
so O
they O
were O
delicious, O
so O
we O
were O
ready O
to O
order O
a O
second O
meal, O
but O
we O
couldn't, O
because O
Nelson's O
pub O
has O
big O
and O
tasty O
dishes. B-TARGET

I O
really O
liked O
the O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
place. O

Well, O
I O
liked O
everything. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
100 O
percent O
service, B-TARGET
and O
I'd O
also O
like O
to O
ask O
the O
staff B-TARGET
to O
keep O
the O
guys O
so O
friendly O
and O
happy O
at O
all O
times. O

I O
suggest O
you O
all O
visit O
Nelson's B-TARGET
pub I-TARGET
and O
get O
all O
the O
good O
emotions O
there!!!! O

Nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
good O
service. B-TARGET

We've O
been O
in O
it O
twice. O

Both O
times O
they O
were O
satisfied. O

Cozy O
Italian-style O
interior, B-TARGET
polite O
and O
thoughtful O
waitresses, B-TARGET
nice O
music B-TARGET
without O
boom-booms. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
isn't O
bad, O
though O
some O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
weren't O
prepared O
by O
the O
rules. O

And O
what's O
most O
important O
is O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

Both O
times O
when O
we O
were O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
only O
two O
or O
three O
tables O
were O
occupied O
with O
us. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
good O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner. O

At O
the O
price: O
dinner O
for O
two O
costs O
about O
2,000p. O

() O
On O
July O
13, O
2014, O
my O
brother O
had O
a O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant! O

It's O
all O
very O
nice. O
It's O
a O
beautifully O
decorated O
hall, B-TARGET
cozy O
interior, B-TARGET
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
at O
a O
very O
high O
level!! O

I've O
never O
seen O
anything O
like O
it O
before... O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
careful, O
they've O
always O
been O
clean O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
they O
don't O
even O
have O
to O
pour O
anything O
and O
stuff O
it! O

I'd O
like O
to O
pay O
a O
special O
tribute O
to O
waiter B-TARGET
Elena, O
and O
unfortunately O
I O
don't O
know O
the O
name O
that O
served O
the O
bride O
and O
groom's O
table!) O

And O
I'd O
also O
like O
to O
say O
that O
I O
haven't O
left O
any O
feedback O
anywhere O
in O
the O
past, O
and O
I O
thought O
that O
the O
positives O
are O
mostly O
written O
by O
the O
institution's O
employees O
themselves, O
but O
it's O
just O
hard O
not O
to O
write O
when O
such O
good O
and O
kind O
people O
are O
trying O
for O
your O
holiday)) O
()) O
())) O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O

(c)) O

It's O
my O
birthday O
party. O

Like O
three O
years O
ago, O
there's O
nothing O
new O
on O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
just O
pizza O
and O
pasta. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
you O
have O
to O
add O
new O
dishes O
to O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at O
least O
once O
a O
year O
so O
that O
people O
are O
interested O
in O
trying O
something O
new. O

All O
the O
tables O
were O
booked O
next O
to O
us O
and O
there O
was O
something O
to O
celebrate. O

To O
eat O
the O
same O
pizza, B-TARGET
pasta, B-TARGET
and O
exactly O
the O
same O
salads B-TARGET
(they're O
eight O
and O
they're O
all O
mozzarella B-TARGET
vegetables)-- I-TARGET
personally, O
I O
was O
ashamed O
of O
my O
friends O
that O
I O
brought O
them O
to O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
because O
there's O
really O
not O
much O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

If O
you O
look O
at O
this O
place O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
eating, O
it's O
a O
good O
place, B-TARGET
a O
real O
Italian B-TARGET
kitchen, I-TARGET
and O
it's O
not O
expensive. O

Anyway, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice O
and O
talented, O
and O
it's O
made O
a O
cafe O
and O
a O
restaurant O
together, O
and O
since O
the O
opening O
there's O
been O
a O
crowd. O

I O
want O
my O
review O
to O
reach O
the O
administration, O
and O
they're O
starting O
to O
diversify O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
meats, O
garnishes, O
interesting O
salads, O
and O
soup. O

Good O
afternoon! O

Walked O
with O
a O
girl O
on O
22.12-- O
she O
really O
liked O
it. O

In O
fact, O
she O
likes O
Chinese O
more O
and O
she O
always O
drags O
me O
around O
Chinese O
restaurants, O
but O
I O
don't O
really O
share O
her O
delights O
about O
Chinese O
delicacies. O

Some O
dishes, O
it's O
better O
not O
to O
know O
how O
and O
what O
to O
cook) O

Well, O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
the O
boss, O
he O
invited O
her O
to O
Dacha. O

It's O
been O
a O
lovely O
time-- O
a O
delicious O
meal B-TARGET
and O
a O
beautifully O
designed O
room. B-TARGET

As O
soon O
as O
they O
came O
in, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
to O
us. O

I O
really O
don't O
like O
it O
when O
you O
sit O
around O
and O
wait O
a O
long O
time, O
when O
they O
pay O
attention O
to O
you, O
it's O
all O
very O
quick, O
polite. O

The O
order O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long. O

So O
I O
went O
to O
the O
party, O
and O
next O
time O
I'm O
sure O
I'll O
bring O
my O
girlfriend O
to O
you. O

We've O
been O
celebrating O
a O
wedding O
at O
the O
Curly O
Court. O

I'd O
like O
to O
thank O
all O
the O
staff O
of O
this O
institution O
very O
much. O

There O
were O
47 O
guests O
with O
us, O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
room B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
dance I-TARGET
about, O
and O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
room O
to O
dance O
about. O

The O
administrators B-TARGET
helped O
us O
to O
set O
up O
the O
room O
and O
find O
the O
hostess O
(for O
which O
I O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
too). O

The O
menu O
was O
chosen O
for O
1800, O
and O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
bring O
our O
own. O

Everything O
was O
delicious, O
a O
wide O
variety B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
meals, I-TARGET
large O
meals, B-TARGET
and O
the O
main O
guests O
were O
satisfied O
and O
satisfied. O

Anyway, O
it O
went O
five O
plus. O

We'll O
be O
sure O
to O
recommend O
you O
to O
everyone O
we O
know. O

Thanks O
again! O

Anna O
and O
Ivan O

great, O

delicious. O

great, O
cozy. O

Services B-TARGET
- O
6. O

They O
ordered O
a O
table O
the O
day O
before O
the O
visit. O

I O
wanted O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
birthday O
party. O

She's O
already O
been O
to O
Mango B-TARGET
twice, O
so O
she O
chose O
him. O

I O
specifically O
said O
the O
table O
should O
be O
at O
the O
wall O
with O
the O
couch. O

And O
when O
they O
arrived, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
room O
didn't O
know O
anything O
about O
that O
armor. O

There's O
no O
manager B-TARGET
on O
the O
spot. O

The B-TARGET
tables I-TARGET
on O
the O
walls O
with O
the O
couchs O
are O
all O
occupied. O

Disappointing. O

There O
you O
go. O

We O
were O
asked O
to O
sit O
at O
any O
table O
and O
move O
when O
the O
necessary O
time O
was O
available. O

That's O
what O
we O
did. O

It O
wasn't O
a O
bad O
evening. O

Everything O
they O
ordered O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
is O
delicious! O

They O
brought O
it O
in O
on O
time. O

They O
gave O
us O
a O
discount O
as O
a O
birthday O
boy O
and O
a O
compliment O
- O
a O
jug O
with O
a O
lemonade O
of O
their O
own. O

It's O
good, O
too. O

Anyway, O
you O
did O
everything O
you O
could O
to O
keep O
us O
happy. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
girls I-TARGET
are I-TARGET
smart. O

Therefore, O
the O
service B-TARGET
rating O
is O
not O
the O
lowest O
)) O

I O
don't O
know O
who's O
to O
blame O
for O
not O
knowing O
anything O
about O
the O
armor. O

But O
if O
the O
manager's B-TARGET
going O
somewhere, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
he's O
bound O
to O
leave O
information O
on O
the O
desks O
to O
someone! O

Good O
morning, O
we O
were O
at O
the O
restaurant O
last O
night, O
really O
at O
the O
Academy. O

I O
really O
want O
to O
write O
a O
thank-you! O

I O
suggest O
you O
all, O
we O
booked O
the O
table O
in O
advance, O
and O
we O
wanted O
a O
specific O
one. O

There O
were O
no O
problems, O
there O
were O
10 O
minutes O
before O
the O
deadline, O
the O
table O
was O
ready. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
administrator I-TARGET
was O
very O
polite, O
smiled, O
conducted, O
immediately O
brought O
a O
menu. O

It O
wasn't O
a O
minute O
before O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
showed O
up. O

To O
my O
great O
regret, O
I O
don't O
remember O
the O
name! O

But O
thank O
him O
so O
much O
from O
me! O

Non-addictive, O
always O
in O
sight, O
guesses O
chewing, O
humor. O

The O
food O
came O
in O
very O
quickly, O
any O
question O
on O
the O
menu, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
answers O
without O
thinking, O
working O
very O
professionally. O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
visitors O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
but O
you O
barely O
hear O
people O
behind O
the O
tables. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
well O
planned, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
muffled. O

We O
were O
thrilled. O

Three O
hours O
in O
one O
breath. O

I O
suggest O
you O
all O
go, O
but O
the O
table's O
better O
booked, O
especially O
for O
tonight! O

Prices O
are O
quite O
acceptable: O
we O
paid O
2,200 O
for O
a O
big O
pizza B-TARGET
and O
six O
cocktails. B-TARGET

We O
were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
for O
my O
birthday! O

I O
really O
liked O
it. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
to O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
Dmitri, O
very O
polite O
and O
kind! O

Cesar's B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
pasta B-TARGET
and O
pizza B-TARGET
were O
all O
good. O

Dmitri O
also O
gave O
us O
a O
very O
good O
white B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
and O
when O
he O
found O
out O
I O
was O
having O
a O
party, O
we O
got O
a O
fruit O
plate O
as O
a O
gift! O

I O
want O
to O
celebrate O
the O
interior-- B-TARGET
stylish, O
warm O
and O
cozy. O

Let's O
go O
in O
again! O

I O
recommend O
it. O

Good O
afternoon! O

Recently O
(22 O
November) O
visited O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
went O
with O
our O
parents. O

The O
rest O
are O
very O
happy. O

- O
Pretty O
nice O
interior, B-TARGET
muffled, O
soft O
light, B-TARGET
quiet O
music B-TARGET
(do O
not O
interfere). O

- O
A O
lot O
of B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
and O
a O
lot O
of O
variety. O

- O
We O
were O
served O
very O
quickly. O

They O
served O
the O
drinks O
immediately, O
brought O
the O
salads O
a O
little O
later, O
and O
before O
we O
could O
finish O
eating, O
we O
started O
serving O
the O
hot O
ones. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
served O
immediately, O
and O
it O
was O
already O
very O
chilled, O
which O
was O
particularly O
good. O

- O
It's O
very O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
kitchen. B-TARGET

It O
was O
really O
good! O

We O
ordered O
quite O
a O
variety O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
enjoyed O
everything! O

Thank B-TARGET
the O
cooks O
separately! O

You've O
eaten O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
your O
heart, O
and O
you've O
enjoyed O
it.) O

There O
were O
six O
of O
us, O
we O
ordered O
salads, O
two O
kinds O
of O
eggplants, O
tofu, O
duck, O
fish, O
two O
kinds O
of O
meat, O
small O
things, O
and O
plus O
alcohol O
(moderately), O
and O
it O
cost O
three O
cents. O

And O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
huge. O

We O
ate) O

- O
I O
really O
didn't O
like O
the O
smoke O
in O
the O
room. B-TARGET

And O
because O
the O
room B-TARGET
was O
general, O
all O
the O
clothes O
were O
stinking. O

- O
Didn't O
like O
the O
toilets B-TARGET
very O
much. O

I O
think O
it's O
clean, O
but O
it's O
not O
neat. O

Overall, O
the O
impression O
is O
very O
good. O

Of O
course O
we'll O
be O
back. O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
place O
before, O
and O
I've O
always O
noticed O
that O
the O
staff O
here O
are O
a O
little O
slow, O
but, O
in O
principle, O
there O
have O
been O
no O
special O
claims, O
everyone O
has O
been O
friendly O
until O
today... O

Here O
we O
go, O
my O
mom O
and O
I, O
after O
the O
theater, O
happy O
and O
happy, O
and O
for O
my O
trouble, O
I O
decide O
to O
take O
her O
to O
the O
long B-TARGET
tail. I-TARGET

When O
we O
came O
in, O
we O
were O
very O
nicely O
met O
and O
offered O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
ground O
floor, O
thinking O
for O
a O
while O
about O
sitting O
near O
the O
entrance O
next O
to O
the O
bar. O

I'll O
point O
out O
that O
there O
wasn't O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
which O
surprised O
me O
to O
find O
out, O
but O
I O
think O
everyone's O
upstairs, O
so O
it's O
gonna O
be O
fast O
enough... O

After O
we O
sat O
down O
for O
10 O
minutes O
and O
moved O
the O
menu, O
which O
my O
mom O
was O
very O
excited O
about, O
so O
quickly O
we O
chose O
to O
eat O
and O
wait O
for O
the O
waiter, O
there O
was O
a O
hostess B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance O
who O
spoke O
very O
nicely O
on O
the O
phone O
with O
her O
girlfriend, O
and O
all O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
ran O
past O
us, O
in O
a O
shy O
way, O
a O
girl/young O
man O
can O
you? O

We O
were O
told O
with O
a O
frank O
disregard, O
after O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting, O
we O
just O
got O
up O
and O
left, O
the O
mood O
was O
ruined, O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
my O
mom O
happy!!!! O

Kitchen O
and O
interior O
ratings O
are O
from O
past O
experience, O
and O
I O
hope O
nothing's O
changed. O

But O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

So O
40 O
minutes O
wasted, O
no O
result. O

I've O
never O
written O
a O
review, O
but O
I O
have O
to. O

Looking O
for O
a O
nice O
place O
with O
friends O
in O
the O
north O
to O
be O
cozy, O
not O
too O
noisy, O
like O
in O
popular O
cafes, O
but O
not O
a O
restaurant-- O
a O
generally O
decent O
pub O
for O
good O
drinks O
and O
snacks. O

And O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
exactly O
what O
it O
is! O

Even O
better. O

The O
very O
fact O
that O
we O
managed O
to O
sit O
in O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
lucky O
thing O
to O
see O
a O
free O
table O
almost O
in O
the O
corner-- O
just O
lucky O
he O
was O
free. O

So O
before O
we O
go O
here, O
we're O
gonna O
make O
a O
reservation. O

We O
haven't O
tried O
the O
beer, O
so O
I O
won't O
say O
anything. O

We've O
tried O
cocktails, B-TARGET
they're O
beautiful, O
they O
feel O
like O
they're O
made O
of O
good O
drinks, B-TARGET
right? O

A O
special O
thank O
you O
to O
the O
waitress-- B-TARGET
she O
was O
just O
guessing O
our O
wishes, O
and O
she O
was O
advising O
us O
what O
we O
wanted. O

Maintenance B-TARGET
of O
10 O
points. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

It O
is O
also O
worth O
noting O
a O
beautiful, O
cozy O
and O
stylish O
interior B-TARGET
and O
an O
impeccable O
musical B-TARGET
background I-TARGET
(for O
those O
who O
care O
about O
it). O

It O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
home O
and O
all O
mine. O

Thank O
you, O
Radio B-TARGET
for O
a O
great O
night! O

Today, O
we O
all O
went O
to O
Marcellis' O
restaurant O
as O
a O
family. O

For O
the O
first O
time, O
we O
were O
satisfied, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
exceeded O
our O
expectations, O
didn't O
meet O
everywhere O
as O
if O
we O
were O
visiting O
friends).)) O

They O
came O
to O
eat O
around O
16:00, O
they O
had O
a O
full O
room, O
they O
didn't O
order O
a O
table, O
so O
they O
had O
to O
sit O
very O
close O
to O
the O
door, O
but O
since O
we O
had O
little O
kids, O
they O
were O
worried O
they O
were O
gonna O
lose O
the O
kids. O

The O
girl B-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
came O
into O
a O
position, O
and O
immediately O
resolved O
the O
matter O
(in O
just O
a O
few O
minutes O
we O
were O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
on O
soft O
sofas) B-TARGET
and O
immediately O
accepted O
the O
order. O

The O
situation B-TARGET
at O
the O
restaurant O
is O
actually O
very O
pleasant O
and O
homemade, O
dirty O
plates O
disappearing O
off O
the O
table, O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
nice O
and O
smiley. O

In O
the O
kitchen, O
a O
halibut B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a O
spinat O
was O
very O
much O
liked, O
and O
we O
never O
met O
such O
a O
tender O
halibut, B-TARGET
and O
I O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
salad B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
) O
) O
mostly O
made O
things O
happy, O
left O
happy O
and O
well-satisfied. O

Also, O
we O
didn't O
order O
desserts, O
so O
our O
dinner O
was O
pretty O
full, O
but O
it O
was O
nice O
to O
be O
surprised O
when O
we O
were O
served O
with O
tasty O
little O
drinks. O

Now O
we're O
frequent O
guests O
at O
this O
place, B-TARGET
all O
family O
holidays O
will O
be O
celebrated O
in O
Marcellis. B-TARGET

Guys, O
let's O
go, O
thank O
you O
very O
much. O

P. O

S.: O
I O
can't O
help O
but O
note O
the O
trembling O
attitude B-TARGET
towards I-TARGET
children I-TARGET
in O
this O
restaurant, O
my O
little O
ones O
enjoying O
it O
so O
much, O
barely O
taking O
them O
home.)) O

also O
a O
pleasure O
to O
have O
a O
special B-TARGET
offer I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
at O
the O

We O

of O

I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
Administrator B-TARGET
Natalia O
for O
his O

It's O
also O
a O

to O
have O
everything O
you O
want O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
ordered O
chocolate O
fountains O
and O
flower O
compositions. O

The B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
fountain I-TARGET
is O
a O
fairy O
tale, O
very O
tasty O

I O
can O
tell O

about O
the O
gym B-TARGET
that O
he's O

Special O

And O
we O
also O
got O
a O
very O
cute O
and O
delicious O
cake. B-TARGET

The O
leader O
was O
invited O
because O
he O
had O
an O
agreement O
with O
him O
before O
the O
restaurant O
was O
chosen. O

All O
the O
guests O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O

We O

Sometimes O
I O
go O
to O
this O
place O
for O
a O
beer O
with O
friends O
or O
two O
with O
a O
friend. O

Fridays O
and O
weekends O
are O
always O
a O
lot, O
there's O
just O
no O
room, O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
at O
a O
table B-TARGET
small O
by O
a O
window, O
not O
quite O
comfortable, O
but O
if O
you O
don't O
have O
a O
choice, O
it'll O
do. O

So O
if O
we're O
gonna O
go O
together, O
I'm O
gonna O
book O
this O
one O
by O
the O
window, O
'cause O
we're O
gonna O
have O
a O
regular O
deposit O
table O
for O
3,000 O
rubles, O
which O
is O
expensive, O
and O
we O
usually O
have O
a O
$1,000 O
bill O
per O
person O
with O
beer O
and O
food. O

The O
beer B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
I O
usually O
take O
the O
vinstein B-TARGET
light, I-TARGET
it's O
classic, O
sometimes O
I O
try O
something O
new. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
generally O
delicious, O
there O
are O
no O
claims, O
and O
the O
meals B-TARGET
are O
adequate. O

Service O
when, O
like, O
sometimes O
limps, O
depends O
on O
the O
waitress, O
I O
think O
the O
waiter O
should O
always O
be O
kind O
and O
kind, O
and O
that O
depends O
on O
my O
assessment. O

All O
in O
all, O
a O
good O
place, B-TARGET
comfortable O
in O
the O
middle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
town, I-TARGET
right O
by O
the O
subway, O
I O
suggest. O

I O
love O
it O
there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
fashionable, O
modern, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
wonderful, O
the O
girls B-TARGET
are O
beautiful, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
amazing, O
everything O
you O
don't O
order O
is O
delicious! O

Rubbed O

in O
the O
first O

you O
get, O
and O
you O
can't O
be O
wrong! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
always O
very O
good O
and O
decent, O
all O
friendly, O
smiling! O

The O
only O
thing O
was O
one O
nuance, O
came O
in O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
Saturday O
to O
eat, O
the O
hostess O
girl B-TARGET
was O
all O
positive, O
it O
was O
evening, O
almost O
all O
the O
tables O
were O
busy O
or O
reserved, O
but O
she O
still O
found O
us O
a O
very O
good O
place. O

Sit O
down, O
bring O
the O
menu O
waiter, B-TARGET
leave, O
wait O
20 O
minutes O
till O
he O
comes O
over, O
order, O
order O
in O
just O
15 O
minutes, O
it's O
a O
pleasure, O
with O
the O
restaurant O
fully O
loaded, O
cooked O
fast, O
eat O
badly) O

The O
empty O
plates O
didn't O
take O
long, O
the O
empty O
cup O
of O
coffee O
didn't O
notice O
at O
all, O
took O
the O
plates, O
but O
left O
all O
the O
dirty O
appliances, O
then O
came O
up O
to O
the O
table, O
took O
the O
sugar O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
next O
table, O
and O
there O
the O
men O
sat O
there O
drinking O
the O
cups, O
and O
nothing O
so O
my O
friend O
had O
coffee O
and O
she O
needed O
sugar! O

Well, O
it's O
kind O
of O
weird, O
you O
know, O
flying O
around O
in O
the O
clouds) O

But O
it's O
not O
gonna O
scare O
us, O
and O
we're O
gonna O
go O
to O
the O
Chather!!! B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

Everything O
was O
great! O

Everyone O
was O
satisfied O
with O
both O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
the O
interior B-TARGET
and O
the O
maintenance. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
administration B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant! O

We O
have O
always O
met O
our O
wishes O
and O
all O
have O
done O
so O
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

The O
canteen O
menu O
was O
for O
4 O
tons O
- O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
per O
person O
came O
out O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
(in O
any O
case, O
hot B-TARGET
snacks I-TARGET
and O
second B-TARGET
dishes) I-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

On O
October O
18, O
he O
celebrated O
his O
birthday O
in O
Paberty. O

He O
ordered O
a O
feast O
for O
15 O
people. O

This O
is O
the O
restaurant O
chosen, O
first O
of O
all O
because O
of O
his O
brewery, B-TARGET
and O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
a O
friend O
had O
a O
discount O
card O
for O
this O
place:) O

The O
beer B-TARGET
here O
has O
really O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
awesome, O
just O
above O
all O
praise! O

For O
the O
first O
time, O
I've O
tasted O
fresh B-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
and O
now O
I'm O
probably O
never O
gonna O
be O
able O
to O
drink O
the O
usual O
spill O
again, O
and O
the O
bottle O
is O
all O
the O
more O
so O
: O
) O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
made O
us O
very O
happy, O
too! O

I O
ordered O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
- O
and O
snacks, B-TARGET
and O
hot... B-TARGET
I O
can't O
even O
single O
out O
anything O
especially. O
Everything O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
delicious. O

Our O
desk O
was O
served O
by O
several O
waiters B-TARGET
at O
once, O
so O
all O
the O
dishes O
and O
drinks O
were O
taken O
very O
quickly, O
dirty O
dishes O
and O
ashtrays O
also O
disappeared O
lightningly O
from O
the O
table O
and O
replaced O
by O
clean. O

Well O
done, O
guys, O
for O
this O
kind O
of O
service, B-TARGET
it's O
not O
pathetic O
to O
tip. O

The O
restaurant's O
entertaining B-TARGET
program I-TARGET
also O
enjoyed O
it, O
not O
only O
did O
you O
drink O
it, O
but O
it O
also O
succeeded O
in O
dancing, O
in O
short, O
it O
was O
fun O
:) O

To O
sum O
up, O
the O
day O
went O
on O
Ura, O
and O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
insanely O
happy, O
and O
for O
that, O
thank O
you O
so O
much O
to O
all O
of O
Paberty's B-TARGET
staff! I-TARGET

We O
went O
to O
Moscow O
Friday O
with O
friends, O
they're O
frequent O
guests, O
I've O
been O
there O
for O
the O
second O
time. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
handsome, O
typical O
of O
Ginza, O
soft O
couches, B-TARGET
big I-TARGET
tables, I-TARGET
warm O
colors, B-TARGET
beautiful O
girls..)) B-TARGET

Anyway, O
everybody's O
having O
a O
nice O
time! O

Service B-TARGET
is O
at O
a O
decent O
level! O

Sommel's B-TARGET
a O
nice O
young B-TARGET
man, I-TARGET
helpful O
in O
making O
choices, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
very O
polite, O
performing O
her O
duties O
well!) O

I've O
been O
looking O
forward O
to O
eating O
it O
lately, O
but O
I O
was O
very O
afraid O
to O
buy O
it O
in O
the O
pancakes O
around O
the O
subway, O
so O
I O
was O
happy O
with O
my O
choice.))))"The O
guys O
ate O
vegetable O
salad O
with O
crab O
and O
shrimp, O
beef O
steak O
with O
mashed O
potatoes O
- O
salad B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
steak's B-TARGET
even O
better.) O

And O
for O
the O
last O
time, O
dessert, B-TARGET
almond B-TARGET
loaf.....I I-TARGET
don't O
know O
how O
to O
put O
it O
in O
words, O
but O
I'm O
writing O
and O
I'm O
getting O
sick O
of O
it!!!!! O

Incredibly O
tasty O
roll, B-TARGET
melting O
in O
the O
mouth, O
the O
highest O
pleasure!!! O

I O
want O
more!))) O

I've O
known O
this O
place O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
maybe O
two O
years. O

And O
it's O
still O
the O
best O
place B-TARGET
for O
me. O

Whenever O
it O
comes O
to O
meat, B-TARGET
I'll O
mention O
Abageur. B-TARGET

Meat's B-TARGET
great, O
and O
I O
don't O
even O
think O
about O
another O
place O
if O
I O
want O
to O
eat O
meat. O

But O
even O
with O
a O
great O
kitchen, B-TARGET
I O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
there O
if O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
and O
the O
visitor O
weren't O
so O
soulful. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
know O
what O
they're O
doing, O
they're O
gonna O
talk O
about O
all O
the O
dishes, O
they're O
gonna O
give O
you O
advice O
on O
what O
to O
choose, O
they're O
not O
gonna O
drown O
if O
you O
ask O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
meal. O

Well, O
the O
important O
thing O
is O
for O
me, O
just O
nice O
people, B-TARGET
thank O
you O
guys. O

And O
because O
of O
the O
human O
relationship O
of O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
I'm O
just O
happy O
to O
come O
by O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee O
in O
my O
spare O
time. O

The O
kitchen's B-TARGET
happy O
with O
everything, O
I O
really O
like O
everything, O
and O
I O
still O
think O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
place O
for O
me. O

But O
I'll O
select O
the O
duck B-TARGET
from O
the O
menu! O

You O
have O
to O
try, O
it's O
unhumanly O
tasty! O

And O
of O
course, O
take O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
lights B-TARGET
are O
soft, O
the O
places B-TARGET
are O
comfortable, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
well O
chosen) O

What O
else O
do O
you O
want O
to O
add, O
I O
love O
Abajour? B-TARGET
) O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
to O
the O
Empire B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
for O
a O
lovely O
dinner! O

Everything O
was O
up O
high: O
the O
restaurant's O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting, O
and O
in O
life O
it O
looks O
even O
better O
than O
in O
a O
photo O
(a O
lot O
of O
sculptures, B-TARGET
interesting O
lights, B-TARGET
bigger O
soft O
sofas), B-TARGET
polite O
and O
fast O
waiters, B-TARGET
quiet O
music B-TARGET
(after O
8:00 O
a.m. O
live B-TARGET
performance I-TARGET
- O
interesting O
to O
hear) O
and, O
of O
course, O
very O
tasty O
food! B-TARGET

I'd O
especially O
like O
to O
mention O
steaks B-TARGET
(they're O
above O
praise) O
and O
desserts B-TARGET
(we've O
tried O
Almond B-TARGET
- O
ready O
in O
the O
very O
restaurant, O
indescribably O
tasty)! O

As O
a O
result, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
advise O
the O
Empire B-TARGET
not O
only O
as O
a O
restaurant O
for O
weddings, O
birthdays O
(beautiful O
big O
halls, B-TARGET
comfortable O
dance B-TARGET
floor, I-TARGET
living B-TARGET
music) I-TARGET
but O
also O
as O
a O
place O
with O
a O
cozy O
romantic O
environment! B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
great O
Friday O
night! O

We'll O
make O
sure O
to O
visit O
you O
again! O

Great O
cafe!!!!!!! B-TARGET

She O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
with O
her O
friends. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful O
- O
delicious O
and O
abundant O
food, B-TARGET
big O
dishes, B-TARGET
atmosphere, B-TARGET
polite O
Alexander's O
administrator. B-TARGET

A O
little O
cozy O
cafe. B-TARGET

Prices O
are O
very O
low O
(and O
this O
is O
because O
the O
site O
is O
located O
on O
the O
Nevsk O
Prospect). O

It's O
not O
the O
first O
time O
I've O
come O
here, O
and O
I'm O
always O
very O
happy. O

Very O
tasty O
hachapuri B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese, I-TARGET
delicious O
salmon. B-TARGET

And O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

My O
friends O
have O
decided O
to O
come O
here O
more O
than O
once. O

In O
terms O
of O
negatives: O
Minus O
is O
probably O
one: O
Downstairs O
is O
not O
a O
very O
beautiful O
anthruze. B-TARGET

At O
least O
I O
don't O
like O
it O
very O
much. O

But O
it's O
probably O
for O
an O
amateur. O

Everything O
on O
the O
top B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
is O
great!!!!!! O

But O
you O
can O
sing O
karaoke B-TARGET
downstairs! O

There's O
a O
very O
tasty O
squid. B-TARGET

Anyway, O
I'm O
gonna O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
everyone O
who O
wants O
to O
have O
a O
tasty, O
fat, O
low-cost O
holiday O
or O
just O
sit O
in O
a O
comfortable O
environment B-TARGET
together. O

Very, O
very O
happy!!!!! O

It O
was O
the O
second O
time O
they O
celebrated O
their O
birthday O
in O
Palkin. O

Without O
an O
advance O
reservation, O
the O
table O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
free. O

They O
went O
up O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
and O
the O
tables O
were O
empty, O
but O
they O
weren't O
enough. O

We O
met O
warmly, O
put O
a O
big O
bouquet O
in O
a O
big O
vase. O

Helped O
me O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
table. O

They O
offered O
bread O
for O
choice O
(a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
came O
up O
several O
times O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
offered O
bread O
"whatever O
you O
want") O
and O
three O
kinds O
of O
oil. O

The O
evening O
at O
Palkin's O
restaurant O
took O
place O
in O
a O
delicate O
environment B-TARGET
created O
by O
polite O
and O
thoughtful O
staff. B-TARGET

They O
served O
us O
carefully O
and O
discreetly, O
although O
there O
were O
many O
guests, O
both O
ours O
and O
foreigners. O

Our O
table O
was O
served O
to O
guests O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

Compliments B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
chef, O
salads, O
snacks, B-TARGET
hot B-TARGET
meals I-TARGET
are O
original O
and O
great. O

And O
what O
show B-TARGET
was O
shown O
to O
us O
by O
two O
young O
people O
in O
charge O
of O
making O
the O
dessert O
order O
right O
in O
front O
of O
our O
table. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
for O
a O
lovely O
evening. O

We O
had O
a O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant! O

The O
wedding O
was O
wonderful, O
the O
mood O
was O
ruined O
here! O

It O
wasn't O
about O
the O
price, O
it O
was O
just O
about O
the O
rich O
table, O
the O
administrator O
said O
it O
was O
quite O
enough, O
even O
though O
we O
had O
a O
menu O
for O
18 O
people, O
and O
two O
couldn't O
come, O
and O
the O
order O
was O
over O
2,000 O
per O
person, O
and O
there O
wasn't O
enough O
food B-TARGET
anyway! O

Six O
little O
pieces O
of O
red B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
on O
a O
healthy O
dish, O
etc. O
looked O
funny. O

I O
understand O
the O
beautiful O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
the O
layout B-TARGET
of O
the O
table, O
but O
don't O
make O
the O
guests O
laugh O
with O
six O
roulettes B-TARGET
on O
a O
huge O
dish! O

I O
don't O
know O
if O
they're O
charging O
10% O
for O
the O
service, B-TARGET
and O
we O
only O
had O
one O
waiter, B-TARGET
and O
there O
was O
no O
alcohol O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
he O
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
wasn't O
able O
to O
fill O
it O
up, O
so O
the O
guests O
were O
sitting O
with O
empty O
glasses! O

He's O
the O
only O
one O
who O
didn't O
get O
all O
hot O
and O
dessert O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
so O
the O
tea O
was O
getting O
cold O
by O
the O
time O
the O
dessert O
got O
here! O

Recently, O
they O
were O
at O
their O
friends' O
wedding, O
they O
had O
2,000 O
per O
person O
without O
any O
kind O
of O
service O
(chewing O
at O
will), O
the O
table O
was O
broken O
by O
food, O
and O
much O
remained! O

It O
may O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
dinner O
here, O
but O
I'm O
sure O
you O
shouldn't O
have O
a O
party O
here! O

Don't O
ruin O
your O
party! O

Good O
evening! O

We O
had O
friends O
at O
the O
wedding O
anniversary O
(10 O
years) O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

I O
specifically O
checked O
in O
to O
leave O
a O
review O
of O
the O
party O
because O
I O
really O
liked O
it O
here! O

The O
hall B-TARGET
is O
very O
bright, O
cozy, O
there's O
a O
hotel O
area O
where O
you O
could O
sit O
down O
for O
a O
break O
from O
the O
dance. O

Dance B-TARGET
all I-TARGET
night! I-TARGET

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
from O
friends, O
they've O
been O
advised O
by O
the O
host B-TARGET
and O
the O
musician, B-TARGET
it O
was O
great! O

It's O
fun, O
it's O
good O
music, B-TARGET
it's O
competitions B-TARGET
for O
young O
people O
and O
adults! O

The B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
was O
excellent, O
especially O
the O
beef B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
and O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
salad! I-TARGET

My O
wife's O
excited, O
too. O

She O
was O
eating O
fish O
with O
some O
white O
and O
baked O
potatoes O
sauce. O

The O
whole O
table B-TARGET
was O
really O
great. O

Big O
plates, B-TARGET
richly O
decorated, O
though O
the O
guys O
who O
ordered O
the O
party O
said O
the O
prices O
were O
moderate. O

Now O
I'm O
preparing O
my O
anniversary O
here, O
too, O
and O
my O
daughter's O
thinking O
about O
the O
wedding. O

Very O
good, O
very O
good, O
thank O
you O
very O
much! O

I O
want O
to O
express O
my O
great O
gratitude O
to O
Bravo-Laudez's B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
and O
thank O
her O
owner, B-TARGET
Michael!!!!!! O

Our O
wedding O
took O
place O
on O
24.08.13, O
and O
the O
restaurant O
was O
advised O
by O
its O
friends. O

When O
we O
first O
got O
there, O
we O
felt O
right O
away O
that O
this O
was O
exactly O
where O
our O
wedding O
was O
supposed O
to O
go. O

Michael, O
he O
told O
us O
all O
about O
it, O
helped O
us O
figure O
it O
out. O

We O
celebrated O
in O
the O
big B-TARGET
hall, I-TARGET
it O
was O
adorned O
with O
just O
gorgeous O
balloon B-TARGET
fountains, I-TARGET
with O
hearts O
hanging O
from O
the O
ceiling, B-TARGET
all O
in B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
tones, I-TARGET
and O
I'm O
not O
talking O
about O
our O
place, O
lighting, B-TARGET
great O
flowers B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
table, O
all O
the O
jewelry B-TARGET
was O
gorgeous, O
every O
chair B-TARGET
was O
adorned. O

Karavai O
and O
the O
cake O
we O
ordered O
there, O
we O
got O
them O
all. O

The O
guests O
were O
ordered O
a O
buffet. O

As O
for O
the O
menu, O
we O
ordered O
2,150 O
per O
person, O
so O
much O
food B-TARGET
we O
ate O
for O
three O
more O
days. O

Our O
guests O
still O
remember O
that O
they O
had O
never O
eaten O
so O
deliciously O
in O
their O
lives, O
and O
even O
after O
two O
days O
the O
salads B-TARGET
remained O
fresh!!!!!! O

How O
adorned O
they O
are!! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
great!!!!!!!!!!! O

It O
wasn't O
visible, O
it O
seemed O
like O
they O
weren't O
there O
at O
all. O

So O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
great, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
celebrate O
your O
wedding, O
I O
suggest O
Bravo-Laudez!!!!!!! B-TARGET

You O
won't O
regret O
it!!! O

Nice O
Italian O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
no O
claims. O

The O
only O
thing O
that's O
wrong O
with O
the O
maintenance B-TARGET
is O
that O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
has O
been O
waiting O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
simple, O
both O
inside O
and O
outside. O

The O
dishes O
included O
tomato O
soup, O
risotto O
with O
white O
mushrooms, O
shrimp O
paste O
and O
Caesar. O

The O
pores B-TARGET
were O
large O
enough; O
they O
were O
delicious, O
but O
Caesar B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
chicken O
were O
very O
upset, O
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
untasteful O
with O
fish O
smell. O

It's O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
a O
tasty O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
at O
a O
reasonable O
price. O

We O
were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
in O
April. O

There's O
still O
good O
impressions. O

Started O
with O
coming O
there O
on O
Saturday, O
room O
full, O
no O
room. O

They're O
upset. O

Standing O
in O
front O
of O
a O
bar O
with O
a O
friend, O
waiting O
for O
a O
mutual O
friend O
to O
decide O
where O
to O
go. O

We O
waited O
for O
10 O
minutes O
and O
only O
he O
came O
to O
us O
as O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
came O
out O
and O
politely O
offered O
us O
a O
reservation O
table, O
explaining O
that O
we O
could O
sit O
there O
until O
the O
hostess O
showed O
up. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
nice, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
polite, O
they O
bring O
orders O
fast O
enough. O

Prices O
are O
very O
acceptable, O
especially O
for O
beer. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
full. O

It O
was O
a O
joy O
standing O
in O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
piano, B-TARGET
and O
you O
could O
come O
and O
play. O

Anyway, O
we O
were O
very O
happy. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
friend's O
anniversary O
here. O

Happy! O

The O
great O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
bay O
from O
the O
window, O
the O
blue O
and O
white O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
hall, O
creates O
a O
sense O
of O
tidy O
and O
cleanness. O

Beautiful O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
cozy O
and O
warm O
(including O
in O
the O
shower!), O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET
The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

Very! O

The O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
reasonable. O

Living B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
made O
me O
happy, O
and O
the B-TARGET
singer I-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
really O
liked O
it. O

And O
danced O
with O
pleasure, O
and O
just O
listened. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time, O
and O
we're O
gonna O
come O
in O
without O
cause. O

Thank O
you. O

On O
6 O
September O
2013, O
they O
were O
at O
a O
dinner O
at O
Puri's O
restaurant. O

Picked O
by O
location O
and O
looked O
at O
feedback O
from O
visitors. O

Got O
a O
table O
on O
the O
phone. O

We O
were O
met O
by O
a O
lovely O
girl, B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
administrator, I-TARGET
walking O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
place B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
great. O

Interesting O
interior, B-TARGET
all O
painty O
and O
very O
homemade. O

We've O
been O
given O
the O
highest O
rank. O

Very O
well-versed O
waiter B-TARGET
Andrei, O
for O
which O
I O
thank O
him O
separately. O

He O
gave O
us O
enough O
time O
and O
wasn't O
obsessive. O

He O
recommended O
a O
great O
tea, B-TARGET
which O
we O
loved. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
diverse. O

Got O
the O
order O
quick. O

It's O
all O
good. O

I'll O
encourage O
friends O
and O
acquaintances O
to O
go. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
desire O
to O
visit O
other O
Ginsa O
network O
facilities. O

It's O
been O
a O
while O
since O
I've O
been O
here, O
even O
though O
it's O
close O
to O
me. O

I O
think O
there's O
clearly O
been O
a O
change O
for O
the O
better. O

They O
meet O
politely O
at O
the O
entrance, O
offer O
a O
room O
for O
smokers O
and O
nonsmokers. O

Just O
sit O
at O
the O
table O
I've O
chosen, O
the O
menu O
is O
right O
on O
the O
table, O
but O
choose. O

Picked O
out O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
like O
this. O

The O
teapot O
of O
jasmine O
and O
green O
tea O
didn't O
keep O
you O
waiting. O

We O
started O
cooking O
fast. O

He's O
got O
his O
own O
eel O
rice O
and O
a O
rainbow O
roll. O

Dov's O
first O
meal O
was O
immediately O
brought O
in O
the O
second. O

Great. O

And O
it's O
a O
new O
thing O
that O
my O
table O
was O
not O
served O
by O
one O
waiter O
as O
often O
as O
it O
is, O
but O
by O
a O
group O
that O
is O
currently O
less O
busy. O

It O
clearly O
increased O
the O
speed O
of O
delivery B-TARGET
and O
my O
mood. O

The O
calculation O
was O
also O
quick. O

Goodbye O
on O
the O
way O
out. O

There's O
still O
a O
desire O
to O
come O
in O
here. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
in O
their O
men's O
mass, O
as O
they O
say O
this O
sushi O
thing O
that O
allows O
us O
to O
increase O
the O
speed O
of O
service. O

It O
really O
works. O

What O
else O
you O
have O
to O
work O
on O
is O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
it's O
not O
at O
the O
service B-TARGET
level O
yet. O

I O
can't O
help O
but O
tell O
you O
how O
my O
wedding O
party O
went. O

So O
when O
we O
arrived O
the O
snacks B-TARGET
were O
ready, O
everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
how O
it O
should O
be. O

Waitress, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
clear. O

The O
glasses O
were O
full, O
the O
plates O
were O
empty O
while O
cleaning. O

The O
other O
one O
we O
ordered O
on O
the O
menu. O

After O
the O
order, O
it O
was O
about O
half O
an O
hour, O
maybe O
more, O
when O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
came O
up O
to O
me O
and O
said O
there O
was O
no O
light O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
make O
another O
order O
for O
a O
hot O
one. O

After O
marriage O
and O
walking O
around O
the O
city, O
as O
you O
can O
see, O
the O
guests O
are O
always O
hungry. O

Yeah, O
appetizers O
somehow O
softened O
the O
appetite O
for O
food, O
but O
not O
enough O
to O
wait O
another O
hour. O

There O
was O
nothing O
to O
do, O
everyone O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table O
again O
and O
picked O
out O
other O
dishes, O
and O
after O
20 O
minutes O
another O
order O
was O
made. O

And O
after O
30 O
minutes, O
it O
got O
really O
funny O
when O
the O
administrator O
came O
up O
to O
me O
and O
said O
it O
wasn't O
gonna O
be O
hot O
on O
the O
coals. O

The O
original O
order O
will O
be O
completed. O

There O
was O
nothing O
I O
could O
do O
to O
ruin O
my O
mood O
that O
day. O

15 O
minutes O
later, O
we O
got O
our O
order O
on O
the O
tables. O

It O
didn't O
matter O
at O
the O
time, O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
was O
to O
feed O
the O
guests, O
you O
know, O
and O
yourself. O

Cake. O

The O
pre-ordered O
one B-TARGET
didn't O
live O
up O
to O
my O
expectations, O
so O
it O
doesn't O
taste O
like O
a O
comrade's O
color. O

As O
for O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
it O
is O
very O
suitable O
for O
a O
celebration, O
and O
it O
has O
managed O
to O
work O
with O
a O
photographer O
in O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
VIP O
Hall. O

I'll O
recommend O
it, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
U.S.U. O
should O
order O
the O
kitchen O
in O
advance, O
and O
I'd O
rather O
try O
it! O

Good O
afternoon! O

I O
was O
celebrating O
last O
night O
at O
this O
D.R. O
facility, O
the O
anniversary. O

My O
family O
and O
I O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
time O
spent O
in O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
tasty, O
quite O
good O
choice O
of O
food, B-TARGET
and O
the O
price O
tag O
is O
more O
than O
appropriate O
for O
quality. O

A O
very O
pleasant, O
non-addictive O
service. B-TARGET

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
they O
brought O
a O
compliment O
from O
the O
restaurant O
as O
a O
big O
meal O
with O
fruit. O

I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
despite O
the O
number O
of O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
you O
don't O
feel O
uncomfortable, O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
real O
Italian O
restaurant. O

Good O
afternoon! O

We O
were O
with O
a O
girlfriend O
two O
weeks O
ago O
at O
Olivier's O
restaurant, O
only O
now O
I've O
decided O
to O
write O
a O
review. O

So O
the O
memories O
were O
a O
little O
dull, O
but O
I O
wanted O
to O
share O
the O
impressions!) O

We O
came O
there O
on O
Friday O
night, O
and O
strangely O
enough, O
the O
people O
were O
very O
few, O
which O
in O
principle O
made O
us O
happy O
because O
they O
were O
able O
to O
choose O
any O
table O
we O
liked. O

I O
met O
a O
nice O
waiter B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance, O
I O
walked O
right O
up O
to O
the O
table, O
I O
even O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
jokes O
to O
trade O
with O
him. O

Nice O
interior, B-TARGET
very O
much O
for O
pleasant O
conversation O
and O
good O
time! O

Now O
for O
the O
sweetest, O
for O
the O
food...) B-TARGET

It O
was O
delicious, O
very O
home-made, O
and O
you O
know, O
you O
could O
even O
say O
made O
with O
love) O

We O
ordered O
veal O
and O
mashed O
potatoes, O
hachapuri O
and O
two O
glasses O
of O
white O
wine. O

The O
kittens B-TARGET
are O
tender, O
they're B-TARGET
delicious, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
warm, O
the O
hachapuri B-TARGET
exceeded O
all O
expectations, O
ate O
in O
two O
minutes)) O

Anyway, O
we're O
very O
happy, O
and O
I O
think O
I'm O
gonna O
go O
over O
there O
and O
try O
Olivier's B-TARGET
salad. I-TARGET

Everyone O
wasn't O
gonna O
write O
a O
review O
of O
this O
beautiful O
and O
wonderful O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I've O
celebrated O
my O
birthday O
in O
the O
most O
beautiful O
room O
in O
the B-TARGET
Czarsky I-TARGET
Hall. O

A O
very O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
all O
the O
guests O
have O
noticed. O

The O
table O
just O
broke O
down O
from O
the O
meal, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
well-formed, O
even O
though O
the O
menu B-TARGET
cost O
me O
the O
right O
money, O
the O
alcohol O
was O
mine. O

Yeah, O
I'd O
like O
to O
pay O
special O
tribute O
to O
the O
organization O
of O
my O
party O
and O
the O
work B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters. O

You O
shouldn't O
have O
called O
anyone O
on O
purpose, O
they've O
noticed O
what's O
missing, O
what's O
what O
to O
bring, O
who O
to O
pour))) O

You O
guys B-TARGET
are O
great! O

We O
had O
the O
manager O
of O
another O
restaurant O
with O
us O
and O
she O
spoke O
very O
well O
about O
the O
work O
and O
employees B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

I O
was O
also O
very O
surprised O
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening O
I O
was O
offered O
to O
pack O
in O
bags. O

Way O
to O
go! O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
lovely O
holiday. O

Special O
thanks O
to O
the O
manager B-TARGET
of O
Julia, O
she O
helped O
me O
draft O
the O
menu O
so O
that O
my O
guests O
would O
be O
pleased. O

There O
is O
a O
sense O
of O
professionalism O
())) O

03.09.2014 O
celebrated O
"Love" O
at O
the O
restaurant O
for O
the O
birthday O
of O
the O
loved O
one. O

The O
party O
dinner O
was O
on O
the O
3rd O
floor. O

The O
restaurant's O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
interesting. O

The O
staff, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
ruined O
the O
whole O
holiday O
for O
us O
and O
our O
friends. O

First O
of O
all, O
in O
time O
for O
maintenance, O
waiter B-TARGET
Anastasia O
dropped O
dirty O
instruments O
on O
the O
guest. O

Second, O
she O
was O
constantly O
picking O
up O
the O
dishes O
where O
the O
food O
was O
still O
in, O
and O
left O
the O
empty O
dishes O
on O
the O
table. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
when O
she O
ordered O
the O
water, O
she O
brought O
it O
20 O
minutes O
later, O
saying O
that O
she O
had O
eaten O
all O
the O
time, O
she O
wasn't O
there O
when. O

Men O
ordered O
a O
bottle O
of O
Tequila, O
lemon O
and O
salt. O

Everything O
was O
brought O
separately, O
with O
a O
time O
difference O
of O
10 O
minutes. O

Which O
was O
very O
surprising. O

I O
wouldn't O
recommend O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

There O
are O
restaurants O
in O
Petersburg O
that O
are O
much O
better O
and O
are O
available O
at O
the O
price O
and O
quality O
of O
service. O

I'm O
a O
regular O
guest O
at O
this O
cafe. O

It's O
recently O
been O
renovated O
and O
now O
it's O
light O
and O
cozy. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
often O
with O
friends, O
and O
it's O
a O
holiday O
party. O

High-level O
services, B-TARGET
staff B-TARGET
work O
very O
well O
and O
always O
pay O
attention O
to O
guests. O

I O
recommend O
this O
cafe, B-TARGET
both O
for O
those O
who O
just O
want O
to O
have O
coffee O
in O
a O
quiet O
environment B-TARGET
and O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
celebrate O
their O
birthday O
or O
some O
other O
holiday. O

We O
were O
this O
Saturday. O

Go O
with O
a O
great O
mood, O
walk O
away O
with O
an O
impression O
of O
a O
threesome. O

The O
best O
room B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant, O
made O
by O
a O
smoker. O

So O
you O
want O
to O
look O
at O
Nev O
and O
Ermitage, O
breathe O
smoke. O

The B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
wasn't O
good O
either. O

It's O
either O
the O
same O
thing O
as O
I O
want O
Harcho, O
Mamalig, O
and O
so O
on, O
or O
something O
medium-sized O
at O
a O
high O
price. O

Braley: O
Cheburek, B-TARGET
the O
kid, O
he O
was O
happy O
- O
carpacho B-TARGET
sibas I-TARGET
- O
so O
little O
- O
tasted O
weird O
- O
tuna B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
- O
too, O
so O
sorry O
to O
take. O
- O
shrimp B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
crab I-TARGET
- O
so O
much, O
- O
lamb B-TARGET
barbecue I-TARGET
- O
normal O
- O
baked O
cheese O
- O
brought O
a O
little O
warm O
- O
chocolate B-TARGET
box I-TARGET
- O
the O
kid O
liked O
it O
- O
coconuts B-TARGET
- O
tasty O
Service B-TARGET
was O
too O
obsessive, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
every O
two O
minutes, O
but O
he O
didn't O
follow O
the O
table O
very O
closely. O

He's O
probably O
a O
little O
paranoid O
and O
he's O
been O
trying O
too O
hard. O

I O
don't O
think O
we're O
going O
to O
be O
here O
anymore. O

I'll O
write O
the O
conclusion: O
friendly, O
tasty O
and O
pleasant. O

Saturday O
night, O
there O
were O
plenty O
of O
seats O
available O
to O
choose O
what O
you O
liked. O

There O
are O
comfortable O
sofas B-TARGET
and O
a O
round O
table O
for O
a O
big O
company. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
barman I-TARGET
is O
the O
raisins O
of O
this O
place) O

The O
order O
was O
received O
quickly, O
too. O

Lemonade, O
then O
salad, O
then O
steak, O
then O
coffee. O

All O
in O
good O
time, O
you O
didn't O
have O
to O
sit O
over O
an O
empty O
plate. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
no O
comment. O

The O
steak B-TARGET
was O
a O
steak, O
not O
a O
piece O
of O
fried O
meat. O

Good O
appliances, B-TARGET
new O
dishes, B-TARGET
positive O
interior. B-TARGET

I'd O
like O
to O
stay O
longer. O

The O
check O
was O
on O
860 O
rubles. O
It's O
even O
cheap! O

The O
coffee O
was O
a O
gift! O

It's O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
I've O
left O
a O
job B-TARGET
like O
this. O

I'll O
definitely O
go O
back O
there O
for O
dessert, O
and O
you O
come O
and O
I O
strongly O
recommend O
it! O

I O
happen O
to O
be O
in O
this O
restaurant O
today. O

In O
general, O
it's O
quite O
an O
impression, O
but... O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
disgusting. O

For O
ten O
minutes, O
we O
were O
expecting O
someone O
to O
come O
over O
and O
bring O
us O
a O
menu. O

Then O
they O
tried O
to O
order O
for O
another O
15 O
minutes, O
and O
everyone O
wasn't O
there O
before O
us. O

When O
ordered, O
they O
asked O
me O
how O
long O
the O
dishes O
would O
last, O
and O
eventually, O
as O
time O
was O
short, O
they O
ordered O
Caesar O
and O
Morse O
for O
me, O
and O
pasta, O
pancakes O
and O
morses O
for O
the O
husband. O

After O
30 O
minutes, O
they O
brought O
me O
a O
salad, O
another O
10 O
minutes O
in O
pancakes. O

When O
I O
asked O
about O
the O
Morse O
and O
the O
bread, O
it's O
been O
another O
10 O
minutes, O
it's O
just O
the O
Morse. O

The O
time O
wasn't O
up O
to O
the O
pasta, O
I O
asked O
for O
an O
account O
that O
was O
brought O
right O
away. O

We O
waited O
ten O
minutes O
for O
the O
pasta, O
but O
apparently O
it O
wasn't O
fate O
to O
eat O
it. O

They O
paid O
for O
everything O
(and O
paste, O
too) O
and O
left. O

From O
what O
we O
had O
to O
try, O
it O
was O
delicious, O
so O
there's O
no O
problem O
in O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
something. O

Go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
only O
when O
you've O
got O
three O
or O
four O
hours O
left, O
or O
you O
won't O
be O
able O
to O
make O
it. O

We O
only O
had O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half, O
but O
all O
we O
ordered O
was O
food, O
unfortunately. O

We O
celebrated O
the O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant! O

The O
whole O
thing O
was O
good! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
fresh O
and O
delicious, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
friendly, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
very O
interesting, O
especially O
the O
aquarium B-TARGET
toilet! I-TARGET

A O
very O
good O
location B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
center O
of O
the O
city, O
with O
beautiful O
views B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window! O

But O
we O
didn't O
get O
any O
chairs O
on O
our O
children's O
holiday, O
even O
though O
we O
talked O
about O
it O
the O
other O
day, O
and O
we O
were O
told O
we O
weren't O
gonna O
make O
any O
trouble! O

In O
the O
end, O
one O
was O
put O
in O
half O
with O
grief, O
and O
the O
other O
sat O
all O
over O
the O
feast O
on O
the O
pens O
(and O
I O
can O
see O
they O
couldn't O
stand O
it O
and O
left O
with O
the O
baby O
early O
without O
waiting O
for O
the O
hot O
one O
(and O
we O
didn't O
wrap O
them O
up), O
and O
some O
guests O
didn't O
like O
that O
food O
was O
packed O
in O
plates, O
because O
many O
people O
didn't O
all O
eat... O

But O
those O
were O
the O
only O
flaws O
in O
our O
celebration. O

In O
general, O
I O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
the O
party! O

At O
the O
end, O
we O
were O
all O
wrapped O
up O
and O
given O
drinks, O
no O
alcohol O
left... O

The O
company O
recently O
arrived, O
it's O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
they've O
been O
in O
this O
place, B-TARGET
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
if O
they O
hadn't O
come!!!!! O

It O
was O
Friday, O
the O
people O
in O
the O
room B-TARGET
were O
sober, O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
only O
table O
available, O
so O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
so O
close O
that O
it's O
impossible O
to O
get O
out O
of O
it. O

They've O
been O
ordering O
for O
a O
long O
time O
or O
forgetting O
about O
you, O
always O
coming O
in O
and O
asking. O

We O
took O
hot, O
salads, O
beer, O
and O
snacks O
to O
beer, O
which O
we O
never O
had O
to O
wait O
for, O
even O
after O
one O
hour O
reminded O
us O
what O
we O
shouldn't O
do O
in O
principle. O

But O
they O
didn't O
forget O
to O
turn O
them O
on!!!! O

Salats O
used O
to O
taste O
better. O

The O
food O
has O
been O
brought O
up O
like, O
first O
of O
all, O
without O
instruments, O
all O
the O
time O
to O
remind O
us, O
second O
of O
all, O
awful, O
one O
of O
us O
has O
been O
eating O
for O
an O
hour, O
and O
the O
other O
hasn't O
even O
started O
cooking. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
can't O
wait O
to O
finish O
his O
meal. O
They're O
taking O
the O
plate. O

There's O
a O
gauze O
in O
the O
hall, B-TARGET
and O
I O
can't O
hear O
the O
music B-TARGET
at O
all. O

We O
used O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
with O
pleasure, O
what O
happened-- O
I O
don't O
understand. O

No O
more O
foot!!!!!!!! O

The O
prices O
of O
a O
beer O
restaurant, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
a O
cheap O
carpentry O
beer.((((())) O

We O
want O
to O
express O
our O
great O
gratitude O
to O
you!!!!!! O
On O
July O
17th, O
you O
were O
married O
in O
a O
new O
hall O
in O
Galerna!!!! O

Everybody's O
very O
happy!!! O

A O
big, O
beautiful O
hall, B-TARGET
polite O
waiters, B-TARGET
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
no O
conflicts O
and O
objections O
from O
the O
staff!!! B-TARGET

We O
decided O
to O
book O
your O
restaurant O
very O
quickly! O

There's O
plenty O
of O
places, B-TARGET
there's O
a O
good O
menu, B-TARGET
and O
there's O
no O
need O
to O
decorate O
the O
room B-TARGET
at O
all! O

When O
other O
restaurants O
have O
to O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
to O
close O
the O
creepy O
walls O
and O
make O
it O
look O
like O
a O
holiday!) O

It's O
great O
that O
you O
have O
your O
own O
pastry B-TARGET
shop, I-TARGET
the O
prices O
are O
the O
same, O
and O
the O
cake B-TARGET
was O
the O
most O
delicious!!!! O

You O
don't O
have O
to O
order O
anywhere, O
worry O
about O
the O
delivery, O
the O
cake O
falling O
apart O
on O
the O
way! O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
were O
very O
thoughtful O
and O
kind! O
They O
came O
up O
asking O
if O
it O
was O
all O
right O
what O
was O
best O
to O
bring, O
there O
were O
no O
empty O
bottles O
and O
dirty O
napkins O
on O
the O
table! O

Everything O
was O
great!!!! O

There's O
plenty O
of O
food O
and O
alcohol O
left O
after O
the O
party! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
gathered O
everything O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
us, O
just O
before O
our O
bottles O
of O
wine O
started! O

You O
don't O
run O
into O
one O
of O
those O
in O
regular O
restaurants! O

Separate O
thanks O
to O
Valentine!!!! O

It O
helped O
with O
the O
menu O
and O
the O
wedding O
cake! O

Anyway, O
he's O
gonna O
tell O
me O
what's O
best O
and O
how O
to O
do O
it, O
and O
he's O
gonna O
take O
all O
his O
preferences O
into O
account! O

There's O
no O
reason O
to O
worry O
about O
it O
before O
the O
wedding O
or O
the O
wedding O
day! O

More O
grateful O
customers!!!!!! O

This O
is O
indeed O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
weddings!!! O

Yay, O
yeah, O
yeah!!!!! O

With O
best O
wishes, O
Andrei O
and O
Catherine O
Malashok!!! O

I've O
known O
this O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time, O
almost O
two O
years-- O
I've O
always O
come O
here O
on O
holidays O
if O
I'm O
near O
the O
CCPO. O

There's O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
change O
here O
lately-- O
it O
used O
to O
be O
just O
a O
quiet O
restaurant O
of O
good O
French O
cuisine, O
now O
it's O
getting O
bigger. O

We O
tried O
to O
celebrate O
our O
daughter's O
birthday. O

It's O
expensive O
for O
us, O
but O
I've O
always O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
this O
place O
and O
the O
delicious O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Here O
there's O
a O
menu B-TARGET
for O
the O
kids, O
a O
room, B-TARGET
and O
an O
opportunity O
to O
have O
a O
good O
fun O
program. B-TARGET

The O
animators B-TARGET
were O
great, O
and O
they O
gave O
the O
kids O
a O
real O
party. O

It O
worked O
really O
well. O

Another O
of O
my O
personal O
advantages O
is O
a O
fine O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine. I-TARGET

It O
was O
high O
time O
I O
told O
them O
thank O
you O
very O
much. O

The O
price O
tag O
is O
higher O
than O
average. O

We've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
twice. O

First O
time O
was O
a O
good O
waiter-- B-TARGET
all O
friendly O
and O
quick. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
doesn't O
reach O
Italian O
unless O
it's O
the O
size O
of O
a O
serving. O

But O
it's O
quite O
edible. O

The O
second O
visit O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
very O
disappointing. O

We O
decided O
to O
see O
if O
the O
business O
lunches O
were O
as O
good O
as O
they O
were O
said O
to O
be. O

Disappointment O
number O
one-- O
you O
can O
only O
order O
a O
business O
lunch O
when O
you're O
inside O
the O
room. O

The O
table O
on O
the O
street O
for O
some O
reason O
(??) O
isn't O
meant O
to O
be. O

Okay. O

Resettled O
) O

It's O
hot O
in O
the O
summer O
room. B-TARGET

Very. O

Since O
we O
weren't O
wearing O
a O
bryoni O
and O
a O
Langin, O
we O
started O
to O
serve O
first O
those O
who O
brought O
these O
adorable O
things O
on O
us O
) O

So O
order O
one O
business O
lunch O
if O
you O
can't O
come O
alone? O

So, O
when O
the O
other O
one O
just O
doesn't O
have O
an O
appetite O
or O
a O
meal O
for O
one O
very O
big O
one? O

And O
all O
this O
was O
accompanied O
by O
the O
arrogant O
look O
on O
the O
waitress's B-TARGET
face. O

Conclusion. O

We O
used O
to O
recommend O
that O
friends O
visit O
this O
restaurant, O
and O
we O
wanted O
to O
be O
regulars. O

And O
now O
we're O
gonna O
talk O
friends O
out O
of O
it, O
and O
we're O
not O
gonna O
go. O

It's O
just O
an O
Italian-named O
cottage O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Those O
who O
have O
ever O
been O
to O
Italy O
will O
understand. O

There's O
a O
much O
better O
place O
in O
Peter O
with O
an O
Italian O
kitchen O
and O
a O
better O
service. O

These O
guys O
are O
still O
gonna O
have O
to O
go O
for O
a O
ride. O

It's O
up O
to O
people O
on O
the O
ground. O

And O
if O
the O
manager O
of O
this O
restaurant O
reads O
my O
review, O
let O
him O
take O
note O
of O
it. O

Yes. O

We O
celebrated O
a O
wedding O
in O
Belcanto O
on O
the O
Malochtinsky O
05.07.2013. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
amazing! O

Saying O
we O
liked O
not O
to O
say O
anything!) O

A B-TARGET
royal I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
flowers I-TARGET
near O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
a O
fine O
interior B-TARGET
inside O
the O
restaurant. O

Wonderful O
collection, B-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
food B-TARGET
on O
the O
table O
))) O

They O
took O
the O
menu O
for O
1900, O
even O
though O
everyone O
ate O
actively, O
but O
still O
there's O
a O
lot O
left O
(all O
packed O
with O
them). O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
very O
polite O
and O
unmistakable, O
excellent O
service! B-TARGET

They O
were O
afraid O
there O
would O
be O
little O
room O
(46 O
people), O
but O
there O
was O
no O
focus, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
room B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
dancing I-TARGET
) O

Anyway, O
there's O
nothing O
to O
fight O
about, O
and O
all O
the O
guests O
were O
thrilled O
with O
the O
evening O
they O
spent O
there. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O

I'm O
surprised O
to O
hear O
about O
the O
good O
service. O

There O
were O
four O
times O
of O
which O
only O
one O
was O
properly O
served: O
one O
failed O
to O
give O
the O
menu, O
a O
very O
long O
drink; O
two O
failed O
to O
bring O
the O
salad O
but O
counted; O
three O
times O
the O
epic O
fairy O
- O
the O
ham O
and O
the O
careless O
attitude B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters... O

There's O
no O
menu O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
comes O
along O
and O
says, O
"What O
did O
you O
choose?" O
Of O
what? O

After O
that, O
we O
were O
given O
lunch O
menus O
(the O
usual O
menu O
is O
probably O
only O
one O
for O
the O
whole O
restaurant). O

After O
that, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
withdrew O
and O
was O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
reach O
the O
table O
after O
waiting O
for O
10 O
minutes O
and O
called O
the O
other O
one. O

Three O
minutes O
later, O
I O
took O
the O
order. O

Instead O
of O
the O
soup, O
she O
brought O
another O
soup, O
changed O
it O
two O
minutes O
later. O

The O
drinks O
did O
not O
come O
until O
after O
dessert. O
— O
After O
asking O
for O
drinks!!!! O

It's O
awful O
with O
one O
word! O

Yeah, O
the O
kitchen's B-TARGET
great, O
ketal B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
is O
a O
miracle. O

But O
where O
do O
they O
get O
waiters B-TARGET
like O
that? O

Honestly, O
the O
unpleasant O
impression, O
I O
thought O
things O
had O
changed, O
and O
no. O

I'd O
like O
to O
share O
with O
all O
the O
users O
of O
the O
site O
a O
review O
of O
the O
Duplex O
restaurant. O

We O
have O
chosen O
this O
restaurant O
to O
celebrate O
a O
wedding O
dinner O
with O
friends O
and O
loved O
ones. O

When O
we O
first O
visited O
the O
restaurant, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
assess O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
meal O
and O
see O
the O
interior. O

Since O
the O
celebration O
was O
planned O
for O
25 O
people, O
there O
were O
plenty O
of O
room B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
our I-TARGET
guests I-TARGET
to O
dance, O
among O
others. O

Alexey's O
manager, B-TARGET
who O
took O
our O
order O
and O
signed O
the O
contract, O
held O
the O
whole O
event O
himself, O
which O
made O
us O
very O
happy. O

On O
the O
menu, O
we O
chose O
a O
variety O
of O
dishes, B-TARGET
and O
they O
were O
all O
very O
tasty. O

The O
table B-TARGET
was O
rich O
and O
bright. O

We O
didn't O
have O
to O
decorate O
the O
hall O
separately, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
has O
a O
place O
to O
celebrate. O

Everyone O
was O
very O
happy, O
food, B-TARGET
service, B-TARGET
and O
a O
friendly O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much, O
Alexei, O
for O
our O
party! O

If O
I O
had O
to O
choose O
a O
restaurant O
for O
the O
second O
time, O
I O
wouldn't O
hesitate O
to O
choose O
Duplex! B-TARGET

I O
love O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

In O
a O
quiet O
place, B-TARGET
there's O
a O
place O
to O
park O
a O
car, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy!) O

Let's O
go O
over O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
to O
chat O
and O
eat O
business O
lunch, O
and O
have O
good O
meat B-TARGET
and O
wine B-TARGET
with O
my O
husband!) O

Business B-TARGET
lunch I-TARGET
compared O
to O
other O
restaurants O
is O
not O
the O
cheapest, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
price O
is O
complete!!!! O

The O
pores B-TARGET
aren't O
small O
and O
you O
eat O
very O
well! O

The O
menu B-TARGET
option O
can O
also O
be O
chosen O
at O
will) O

We're O
very O
fond O
of O
drinking O
tea, O
and O
we're O
very O
happy O
that O
tea O
always O
comes O
with O
a O
compliment O
from O
a O
two-cream O
restaurant. O

The O
baked B-TARGET
apple I-TARGET
post O
is O
delicious! O

I've O
been O
trying O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
hands I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
lately O
- O
it's O
good O
and O
it's O
an O
original O
gas O
station!) B-TARGET

I O
can O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
service, O
I O
like O
that O
waiters B-TARGET
aren't O
underage, O
but O
very O
nice O
and O
grown-up O
men!) B-TARGET

My O
favorite O
is O
Peter! O

He's O
always O
worried O
we're O
gonna O
have O
a O
nice O
meal O
and O
everything O
on O
the O
table O
is O
gonna O
be O
okay! O

For O
that, O
thank O
you O
very O
much!) O

But O
other O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
young O
people, O
always O
watching O
the O
table O
clean, O
even O
if O
it's O
not O
his... O

So O
we're O
all O
satisfied O
and O
we O
come O
here O
quite O
often. O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
lovely O
and O
diverse O
kitchens B-TARGET
and O
the O
good O
attitude B-TARGET
toward I-TARGET
clients!!!! I-TARGET

Walking O
downtown O
with O
my O
sister, O
getting O
rid O
of O
the O
heat O
on O
these O
beautiful O
rare O
warm O
days... O

We O
had O
an O
appetite, O
thought O
we'd O
stop O
by O
the O
restaurant O
for O
lunch. O

I O
was O
going O
to O
go O
to O
the O
kitchen O
restaurant O
a O
long O
time O
ago, O
and O
I O
wasn't O
far O
away. O

At O
the O
doorstep, O
having O
felt O
a O
slight O
coolness O
of O
the O
air B-TARGET
conditioner I-TARGET
and O
having O
heard O
pleasant O
music, B-TARGET
they O
realized O
that O
they O
had O
made O
the O
right O
choice! O

Girls B-TARGET
administrators I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
pleasant, O
cozy O
atmospheres, B-TARGET
hateful O
style O
interiors, B-TARGET
comfortable O
tables, B-TARGET
clean O
and O
tasty. O

A O
menu. O

The O
variety O
of O
food, B-TARGET
the O
waiters B-TARGET
competent, O
they'll O
name O
the O
ingredients, O
they'll O
give O
you O
advice O
according O
to O
your O
food O
preferences. O

Dinner's O
great, O
fast, O
full, O
and O
most O
important, O
it's O
delicious! O

Amazing O
desserts, B-TARGET
I'm O
like O
the O
real O
sweet O
guy, O
with O
the O
highest O
rating. O

In O
fact, O
there's O
a O
lot O
to O
celebrate, O
but O
it's O
probably O
worth O
the O
credit O
for O
everyone. O

I O
can O
safely O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
those O
who O
would O
like O
you O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
pleasant O
atomosphere B-TARGET
and O
enjoy O
a O
good O
and O
good O
cooked O
meal! B-TARGET

It's O
always O
possible O
to O
find O
negatives O
wherever O
we O
go, O
and O
it O
depends O
on O
our O
mood. O

Although O
in O
some O
places O
in O
our O
city O
they O
find O
themselves, O
these O
negatives... O

It's O
an O
objective O
place. B-TARGET

The O
other O
day, O
on O
a O
business O
trip, O
work O
colleagues O
came O
and O
the O
four O
of O
us O
snuck O
into O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Kamnoostrov. O

They've O
eaten O
enough, O
they've O
really O
liked O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

I O
personally O
ordered O
salmon O
and O
mashed O
salmon O
and O
a O
Canadian O
roll. O

Anyway, O
this O
isn't O
my O
first O
visit O
to O
this O
place, O
and O
I've O
tried O
the O
cutlets B-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
here, O
but O
this O
time, O
they O
were O
different, O
better O
and O
better, O
as O
I O
thought. O

Roll B-TARGET
was O
great O
at O
all, O
compared O
to O
him O
wouldn't O
stand O
the O
food O
from O
the O
traditional O
Peter's O
Network O
of O
Japanese O
Kitchens) O

Although, O
of O
course, O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
that's O
the O
right O
comparison, O
there's O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
sushi O
in O
other O
places. O

After O
a O
question, O
the O
waiter O
found O
out O
that O
the O
chef O
had O
changed O
and O
that O
the O
menu O
was O
now O
being O
changed. O

Disturbance O
brought O
in O
information O
that O
salmon B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
cutlets I-TARGET
want O
to O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
mess. O

Colleagues, O
too, O
really O
liked O
the O
food. B-TARGET

Especially O
two B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
salmon O
steak, B-TARGET
and O
strogans B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mashed O
potatoes. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
has O
changed, O
too, O
but O
it O
hasn't O
changed O
much, O
the O
service, B-TARGET
as O
it O
used O
to O
be O
on O
a O
rather O
good O
level, O
so O
we're O
happy, O
thank O
you! O

I O
know O
that O
reviews O
are O
often O
looked O
at O
by O
restaurant O
administrators, O
a O
very O
big O
request O
to O
you, O
please O
don't O
remove O
the O
cutlets O
from O
the O
menu!!!!! O

Thank O
you! O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
interesting. O

We O
should O
just O
go. O

But... O

Service B-TARGET
is O
a O
nightmare. O

The O
last O
Soviet O
canteen O
is O
better O
served. O

We O
didn't O
come O
very O
hungry, O
so O
we O
ordered O
some O
food O
and O
tea. O

What O
did O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
tell O
us O
that O
the O
order O
should O
be O
1500pm, O
and O
if O
not, O
he O
won't O
even O
open O
a O
table. O

Then O
he O
said O
that O
they O
had O
25,000 O
clients O
left O
behind O
at O
all, O
and O
so... O

Honestly, O
it's O
a O
very O
unpleasant O
feeling. O

We've O
ordered O
more O
cocktails, O
of O
course, O
but O
to O
be O
honest, O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
go O
there O
any O
more. O

And O
it's O
not O
about O
money, O
it's O
about. O

Well, O
if O
it's O
so O
hard, O
you'd O
be O
warning O
about O
the O
deposit, O
but O
you'd O
still O
have O
to O
book O
it O
on O
the O
phone... O

And O
a O
few O
words O
about O
the O
kitchen. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
good, O
but O
it's O
very O
small O
(as O
we O
have O
in O
Russia O
in O
restaurants O
for O
some O
reason). O

It's O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place. B-TARGET

Nice O
price O
tag O
on O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
are O
tight O
- O
9 O
points. O

It's O
a O
convenient O
location, B-TARGET
there's O
a O
parking B-TARGET
lot. I-TARGET

I O
can't O
say O
I O
liked O
everyone, O
but O
some O
are O
very O
worthy. O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
of O
this O
place O
is O
the O
number O
of O
people O
on O
weekends O
and O
the O
way O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
cooks B-TARGET
handle O
this O
stream. O

I O
hope O
they'll O
solve O
this O
problem-- O
long O
service, B-TARGET
but O
in O
general, O
we O
love O
this O
place B-TARGET
and O
we O
all O
recommend O
it, O
especially O
on O
Sundays!!!!!) O

Friends O
from O
Vilnius O
are O
here O
to O
see O
us. O

A O
few O
days O
of O
cultural O
program O
in O
our O
beautiful O
Petersburg. O

So O
one O
day O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
lunch O
at O
Ajabsandal's O
restaurant. O

We O
are O
four O
adults O
and O
three O
children O
(4.6 O
and O
9 O
years O
old). O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
restaurant. O

WE O
REALLY O
enjoyed O
it!!! O

When O
there O
was O
no O
one O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
two O
more O
visitors O
arrived O
later. O

It's O
a O
nice O
interior, B-TARGET
probably O
even O
more O
comfortable O
in O
real O
life. O

Sit O
down O
at O
the O
big O
table. O

Ordered: O
Harcho, O
Lagman, O
Hinkali, O
Chihirtma, O
Duschbara, O
Dolm, O
Hachapuri, O
Mengrel O
(1 O
unit) O
was O
a O
piece O
for O
everyone. O

All O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
homemade. O

The B-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
has I-TARGET
a O
great O
deal O
of O
respect. O

It's O
four O
grand, O
good O
size, O
after O
a O
salad O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
hachapuri O
I O
barely O
ate. O

The O
husband O
also O
ordered O
the O
Hinkali B-TARGET
(after O
Chihirtma) O
and O
said O
that O
he O
could O
have O
one O
for O
two. O

A O
friend O
ordered O
beer, O
harcho, O
and O
lagman, B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
end O
he O
didn't O
finish O
a O
part O
of O
the O
lagman, O
although O
he O
really O
likes O
to O
eat. O

So O
all O
the O
meals O
are O
normal O
and O
everything O
is O
really O
homemade. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
high, O
too, O
not O
obsessive, O
but O
good. O

The O
restaurant's B-TARGET
recommended. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
wants O
to O
wish O
you O
good O
luck O
in O
business O
and O
keep O
this O
quality O
kitchen B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

I O
rarely O
write O
negative O
reviews, O
but O
in O
this O
case, O
I O
just O
think O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
principle. O

We O
came O
in O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
Sunday O
night. O

Let's O
just O
say O
I O
haven't O
had O
this O
disgusting O
impression O
of O
going O
to O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
or I-TARGET
a O
pub O
in O
a O
long O
time. O

I O
met O
and O
served O
us O
with O
an O
open-minded O
waitress. B-TARGET

Half O
of B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
wasn't O
available. O

Asking O
why O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
answered O
the O
call O
that O
yesterday O
was O
all O
over, O
and O
today O
it's O
over. O

I O
ordered O
cheese O
sticks. O

We O
waited O
for O
them, O
we O
waited O
for O
them, O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
came O
and O
told O
them O
she O
dropped O
them O
on O
the O
floor, O
and O
that O
they O
were O
the O
last O
sticks O
and O
they O
weren't O
gonna O
be O
sticks. O

I O
wanted O
to O
get O
up O
and O
leave, O
but O
since O
this O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I O
could O
have O
a O
beer O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
I O
had O
to O
stay. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
ordered O
a B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
cesar, I-TARGET
which O
was O
totally O
disgusting. O

Then O
the B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
didn't O
politely O
ask O
if O
we O
knew O
they O
were O
working O
Sunday O
until O
11:00. O

And O
we O
said, O
"We O
know." O

Well, O
that's O
kind O
of O
a O
thing. O

I O
don't O
suggest O
you O
go O
there, O
but O
maybe O
on O
more O
public O
days, O
they're O
more O
appropriately O
staffed, O
and O
they're O
putting O
everything O
in O
place, O
but O
something O
tells O
me O
they're O
lying. O

Recently, O
40 O
people O
celebrated O
their O
birthday, O
which O
was O
unforgettable. O

Very O
tasty O
pizza B-TARGET
and O
snack B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
hot B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
for O
any O
taste, O
all O
the O
guests O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
cooking O
and O
the O
very O
tasty O
dishes. B-TARGET

They O
ordered O
a O
big O
cake B-TARGET
tiramisu I-TARGET
for O
dessert, O
their O
own O
cooking-- O
it O
was O
delicious, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
room O
left O
in O
the O
stomach, O
so O
they O
gave O
it O
to O
the O
guests O
at O
home. O

Quiet, O
pleasant O
music. B-TARGET

Very O
thoughtful O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
administrators. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
party O
and O
the O
very O
emotional O
atmosphere:) O

I O
really O
didn't O
like O
the O
service! B-TARGET

We O
were O
there O
last O
night, O
ordered, O
brought O
in O
fast O
enough, O
but O
then O
we O
kind O
of O
forgot O
about O
us, O
we O
finished O
drinking O
drinks O
and O
we O
wanted O
to O
repeat O
them, O
but O
no O
one O
came O
to O
us O
for O
half O
an O
hour, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
running O
by, O
but O
they O
weren't O
even O
looking O
at O
us, O
even O
though O
we O
tried O
our O
best O
to O
pay O
attention. O

By O
the O
way, O
there O
were O
very O
few O
tables O
in O
the O
hall... O

In O
the O
end, O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bar O
and O
call O
someone. O

Then O
we O
waited O
for O
drinks O
for O
about O
40 O
minutes, O
and O
on O
the O
question-- O
where O
were O
our O
drinks, O
we O
were O
given: O
"Why, O
have O
you O
not O
brought O
them O
yet?" O

It O
was O
also O
surprising O
that O
the O
guests O
at O
Plushkin O
weren't O
saying O
goodbye. O

A O
sharp O
contrast O
between O
a O
poor O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
tasty O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
a O
cozy O
interior...!!!! B-TARGET

It's O
a O
rather O
different O
place O
of O
opinion, O
and O
I've O
decided O
to O
check O
it O
myself O
because O
I'm O
living O
in O
close O
proximity. O

I O
went O
to O
lunch O
this O
afternoon, O
met O
nice O
enough, O
asked O
in O
the O
first O
place O
or O
was O
there, O
which O
suggests O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
cares O
for O
their O
guests O
and O
remembers O
all O
the O
regulars. O

I O
was O
helped O
to O
choose O
a O
table O
and O
told O
about O
all O
the O
stocks O
and O
offers. O

Especially O
the O
50% O
discount O
on O
the O
Japanese B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
) O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quick O
and O
careful, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
the B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
is O
big, O
but O
I O
only O
had O
tea O
because O
I O
came O
to O
have O
lunch O
and O
I O
can't O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
drinks. O

In O
the O
calculation, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
handsome O
about O
the O
weekend O
program, O
the O
parties O
and O
the O
artists, O
and O
she O
just O
couldn't O
say O
no O
and O
promised O
to O
come! O

In O
fact, O
my O
impression O
is O
quite O
positive O
about O
this O
place, B-TARGET
and O
I O
plan O
to O
visit O
it O
often O
now. O

I've O
been O
wanting O
to O
write O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
and O
I O
haven't O
had O
the O
time O
to O
write, O
but O
now O
I'm O
writing... O

We've O
been O
going O
to O
the O
Watergraves O
restaurant O
for O
years. O

I O
always O
liked O
everything, O
the O
kitchen, O
the O
service, O
the O
atmosphere O
and O
the O
mood O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

I've O
always O
felt O
Ukrainian O
colorite! O

Our O
last O
visit, O
however, O
erased O
all O
positive O
impressions. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
came O
in O
tonight, O
no O
one O
met O
us, O
we O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
our O
own, O
confused, O
and O
after O
10 O
minutes O
(!), O
someone O
came O
up O
to O
us O
in O
the O
panted O
down O
jeans, O
gave O
us O
a O
menu O
and O
said, O
"Wait O
for O
the O
waiter," O
because O
he O
couldn't O
help O
us O
pick O
out O
the O
drinks O
himself. O

I'd O
very O
much O
like O
to O
ask O
the O
managers O
if O
they O
think O
it's O
acceptable, O
provided O
the O
restaurant O
is O
high?!! O

The O
horror O
of O
the O
evening O
continued! O

Next O
came O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
who O
I O
thought O
didn't O
even O
open O
the O
menu, O
unlike O
me, O
who O
studied O
it O
in O
20 O
minutes O
of O
waiting! O

They O
ordered O
it, O
they O
ate O
it O
in O
half. O

We O
decided O
to O
take O
our O
favorite O
cakes O
with O
us, O
knowing O
they O
were O
handmade, O
and O
at O
least O
make O
ourselves O
feel O
better. O

Surprise O
again! O

Turns O
out O
they're O
not O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
anymore! O

When O
asked, O
"Why?" O
the O
waiter O
said O
that O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
do O
them! O

Unfortunately, O
we O
still O
haven't O
figured O
out O
what's O
going O
on O
with O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
it's O
a O
shame O
there's O
no O
proper O
level O
and O
we're O
gonna O
have O
to O
find O
a O
new O
favorite O
restaurant. O

Julia. O

We O
went O
to O
a O
cafe O
with O
a O
friend O
at O
lunchtime. O

Happy O
with O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
environment, B-TARGET
and O
the O
prices. O

They O
ordered O
pizza-- O
very O
tasty, O
really O
great O
pizza. B-TARGET

Mint O
tea O
in O
tea, O
ice O
cream O
not O
dessert, O
a O
glass O
of O
red O
wine. O

Some O
1,000 O
rubles O
have O
been O
paid. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
is O
polite, O
quick, O
answering O
questions, O
no O
complaints. O

The O
only O
downside O
is O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
small, O
if O
there O
are O
a O
few O
plates, O
they're O
hard O
to O
place, O
and O
in O
general, O
the O
inside O
is O
a O
little O
tight, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
close, O
so O
you O
can O
hear O
well O
what O
they're O
talking O
about O
at O
the O
next O
table. O

Coming O
in O
for O
lunch O
is O
a O
good O
choice, O
talking O
about O
something O
and O
sitting O
still O
isn't O
the O
right O
place. B-TARGET

I'll O
come O
for O
pizza B-TARGET
more O
than O
once! O

The O
interior's B-TARGET
not O
bad, O
but O
it's O
very O
specific, O
very O
Italian, O
and O
the O
friend O
didn't O
like O
it, O
so O
maybe O
not O
everyone O
would O
look O
pretty. O

But O
it's O
not O
as O
important O
as O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
normal O
service B-TARGET
:) O

Not O
long O
ago O
we O
were O
in O
Jean-Jacques O
with O
a O
friend, O
so O
I O
thought O
I'd O
share O
my O
impressions. O

We O
usually O
went O
to O
Nevsky O
166, O
and O
this O
time O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Marat O
for O
comparison. O

It O
was O
Friday O
night, O
the O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance. O

We O
were O
not O
met O
at O
the O
entrance, O
but O
as O
we O
went O
a O
little O
further O
to O
the O
bar, O
we O
saw O
an O
administrator O
who O
apparently O
took O
our O
reservation, O
and O
we O
were O
escorted O
to O
the O
table O
and O
offered O
drinks. O

A O
young O
man O
served O
us. O

The O
order O
was O
received O
almost O
immediately, O
even O
having O
been O
able O
to O
enter O
into O
a O
dialogue O
with O
him, O
advising O
both O
the O
fish O
and O
the O
wine. O

As O
for O
the O
service, O
what O
I O
can O
say O
is, O
we O
didn't O
feel O
the O
pressure O
of O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
but O
we O
didn't O
lose O
sight O
of O
it O
either. O

By O
gestures O
or O
views, O
he O
understood O
that O
we O
needed O
his O
help O
and O
responded O
instantly. O

Kitchen... O

Kitchen! O

I O
always O
liked O
the O
way O
they O
cooked O
here. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
juicy, O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
grill, O
and O
the B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
basket I-TARGET
was O
admiring! O

We O
order O
the O
basket B-TARGET
all O
the O
time, O
and O
then O
we O
order O
it O
again O
and O
again O
and O
again O
and O
again! O

You O
can't O
give O
it O
up! O

As O
far O
as O
the O
interior's B-TARGET
concerned, O
it's O
okay, O
but O
only O
one O
less O
for O
me. O

It's O
too O
tight, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
close O
to O
each O
other, O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
hear O
neighbouring O
conversations O
and O
not O
just... O

To O
sum O
up, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
visit O
was O
a O
pleasure! O

Wait O
for O
us O
again! O

We O
celebrated O
our O
wedding O
at O
the O
Favorite O
restaurant O
on O
12 O
August O
2014. O

The O
choice O
was O
made O
according O
to O
several O
characteristics O
of O
the O
place B-TARGET
: O
a O
beautiful O
menu B-TARGET
(big O
choice), O
a O
delicious O
pastry!!!!, B-TARGET
a O
great O
service, B-TARGET
a O
good O
location B-TARGET
(the O
subway O
nearby), O
a O
beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
presence O
of O
natural O
light O
makes O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
even O
more O
comfortable, O
the O
price O
corresponds O
to O
the O
quality!!! O

We O
want O
to O
say O
thank O
you O
to O
all O
staff!!!!!! B-TARGET

Special O
thanks O
go O
to O
Anna, O

and O
the O
restaurant O
itself, O

us O

and O

of O
the O
hall, O

27.04.2013 O
Visited O
your O
restaurant, O
Eurasia, O
with O
your O
family O
in O
town. O

Lomonosov! O

I O
love O
it! O

Services B-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level, O
lots O
of O
menus B-TARGET
and O
drinks) B-TARGET
nice O
interior, B-TARGET
quiet, O
quiet! O

Marina's O
waitress, B-TARGET
she O
was O
polite, O
very O
quick O
to O
take O
the O
order, O
very O
happy O
to O
have O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
quickly O
cooked, O
incredibly O
delicious. O

The B-TARGET
guys I-TARGET
are O
on O
the O
team, O
the O
administrator's B-TARGET
been O
helping O
the O
waiters O
all O
the O
time. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much. O

Good O
luck O
and O
prosperity!! O

Good O
afternoon, O
everyone! O

There O
were O
nine O
people O
in O
the O
restaurant O
last O
night O
with O
the O
company. O

What O
can O
I O
say, O
we O
sat O
in O
Russian O
at O
an O
Italian O
restaurant O
:) O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
comfortable O
enough, O
there O
are O
sofas. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
nice O
music B-TARGET
playing, O
which O
also O
made O
me O
happy. O

They O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
orders, O
and O
my O
choice O
fell O
on O
the O
pasta O
with O
a O
smoked O
breast. O

I O
really O
liked O
it. O

The O
vegetable B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
also O
tasted O
good. O

Meat B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
plates I-TARGET
are O
quite O
common, O
but O
there's O
nothing O
negative O
about O
them. O

The O
guys O
ordered O
mostly O
meat B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
steaks, I-TARGET
and O
by O
their O
happy O
faces, O
you O
could O
see O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
definitely O
tasty O
and O
tasty. O

All O
I O
needed O
was O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
chef, I-TARGET
but O
that's O
right, O
punks. O

We O
drank O
Morse, O
wine, O
vodka, O
beer. O

There's O
no O
surprises O
here, O
unless O
you O
can O
make O
more O
beer, B-TARGET
not O
like O
pubs, O
but O
3 O
or O
4 O
is O
the O
best. O

I O
don't O
welcome O
the O
imposition O
of O
Hineken. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
at O
the O
restaurant O
is O
nice, O
and O
it's O
resting. O

The O
contingent O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
restaurant O
is O
for O
30-year-olds, O
for O
couples, O
just O
for O
lovers. O

But O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
won't O
go O
missing O
either. O

The O
service B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
high, O
and O
it's O
possible O
that O
because O
of O
the O
ambition O
we've O
set O
on O
the O
volume O
of O
the O
order O
and O
the O
result O
of O
the O
future O
tea, O
I O
don't O
know. O

But O
the O
girl B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
kind, O
considerate, O
and O
just O
beautiful O
:) O

I O
think O
Natasha's O
name O
was O
:) O

Too O
bad O
I O
didn't O
pick O
up O
the O
phone. O

Anyway, O
I O
suggest. O

He O
read O
the O
reviews O
on O
the O
site O
and O
decided O
to O
visit O
the O
institution. O

Indeed, O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
on O
the O
level. O

I O
liked O
the O
beautiful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
the O
polite, O
pretty O
quick O
service. B-TARGET

But O
most O
importantly, O
it O
was O
really O
good. O

I O
haven't O
been O
to O
a O
place O
I O
haven't O
had O
much O
trouble O
with O
in O
a O
long O
time. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
with O
our O
friends, O
and O
everyone O
left O
in O
a O
good O
mood. O

I'm O
sure O
I'll O
see O
you O
there O
again. O

It's O
a O
great O
restaurant B-TARGET
or O
more O
like O
a O
cafe. B-TARGET

A O
very O
comfortable O
environment, B-TARGET
good O
staff, B-TARGET
nice O
interior. B-TARGET

It's O
kind O
of O
like O
a O
cafeteria O
from O
Friends, O
not O
a O
design, O
but O
rather O
a O
cozy O
place O
to O
go O
to O
a O
company O
or O
one O
of O
you O
to O
sit O
in O
peace O
and O
read O
a O
book. O

The O
downside O
is O
a O
noisy O
elevator B-TARGET
that O
drives O
food O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
that's O
on O
the O
first O
floor, O
even O
though O
it's O
an O
interesting O
idea. O

And O
for O
someone O
minus, O
and O
for O
me O
plus, O
the O
owner O
of O
an O
anti-alcohol B-TARGET
establishment O
and O
his O
establishment, O
he's O
not O
sold O
in O
principle. O

But O
if O
you O
order O
a O
party, O
you O
can O
come O
with O
your O
own, O
but O
on O
condition O
that O
you O
have O
checks. O

It's O
obvious O
that O
it's O
recently O
opened, O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
in O
time O
it'll O
only O
get O
better. O

It's O
an O
occasion O
when O
you O
want O
to O
get O
together O
just O
for O
your O
little O
company O
in O
a O
cozy O
place. O

She's O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
because O
she's O
kind O
of O
picky O
enough O
to O
find O
this O
beautiful O
cafe. B-TARGET

There's O
everything O
here: O
interiors, B-TARGET
tasty O
special O
dishes, B-TARGET
water O
on O
the O
table, O
which O
is O
particularly O
pleasant O
and O
thoughtful, O
welcome O
staff, B-TARGET
which O
is O
rare O
for O
our O
city. O

To O
say O
that O
everyone O
was O
happy O
with O
my O
choice O
is O
nothing O
to O
say. O

It's O
our O
favorite O
place B-TARGET
now. O

Thank O
you O
Mon B-TARGET
Petit I-TARGET
Cafe I-TARGET
for O
the O
party. O

I've O
never O
written O
a O
review O
before, O
but O
I'm O
overreacting. O

I O
had O
to O
register O
on O
purpose. O
On O
April O
13, O
we O
had O
a O
feast O
at O
Star O
Plovdiv. O

I O
can't O
help O
but O
write O
a O
review O
because O
I'm O
still O
impressed O
by O
visiting O
this O
place. B-TARGET

There O
were O
people O
of O
different O
ages O
at O
the O
party, O
and O
there O
were O
none O
who O
didn't O
like O
anything. O

It's O
great, O
and O
it's O
a O
room B-TARGET
(sitting O
in O
the O
main B-TARGET
hall I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
second O
floor) O
and O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
and O
the O
appearance B-TARGET
of O
the O
table. O

But O
most O
of O
all, O
staff B-TARGET
members I-TARGET
- O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
- O
who O
helped O
to O
make O
the O
order O
properly, O
and O
waiter B-TARGET
Maria, O
whose O
work B-TARGET
is O
above O
praise. O

Greeting, O
smiling, O
all O
bringing O
and O
taking O
off O
on O
time, O
asking O
if O
you O
liked O
it, O
giving O
advice O
before O
ordering O
it. O

I've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
before, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
team! B-TARGET

We'll O
visit O
you O
again, O
and O
we'll O
advise O
your O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
our O
friends. O

Hello! O

Regular O
visits O
to O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
friends! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
the O
weekend O
with O
some O
kind O
of O
psychic, O
fun, O
tasty O
company, O
then O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
for O
that! O

Beautiful O
Margarita, B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
and O
great O
music!! B-TARGET

I O
live O
in O
a O
different O
neighborhood, O
but O
I'm O
happy O
to O
come O
here, O
let O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Mexican O
restaurants O
forgive O
me O
for O
having O
Mexican B-TARGET
food, I-TARGET
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
evening! O

It O
is O
also O
encouraging O
that O
the O
kitchen O
works O
long O
on O
weekends, O
unlike O
many O
other O
establishments! O

Anyway, O
the O
place B-TARGET
has O
never O
failed, O
I O
recommend! O

In O
one O
of O
the O
recent, O
unspringly O
cold O
evenings, O
you'd O
want O
warmness O
and O
comfort... O

I O
invited O
a O
girl O
to O
AMARENA O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner! O

I've O
never O
been O
to O
a O
restaurant O
before, O
but O
I O
often O
pass O
by. O

I've O
wanted O
to O
visit O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

The O
evening O
began O
to O
rejoice O
at O
the O
quickness O
of O
the O
trip, O
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
comfortable O
enough. O

We O
were O
met O
nicely, O
and O
they O
put O
us O
to O
the O
table, O
and O
they O
gave O
us O
the O
menu. O

It's O
all O
right, O
with O
a O
real O
smile. O
(It O
looks O
like O
it O
was O
the O
administrator.) B-TARGET

Soon O
a O
no O
less O
friendly O
waiter B-TARGET
showed O
up O
and O
wondered O
if O
we O
were O
ready O
to O
order. O

We O
looked O
around O
waiting O
for O
food. O

A O
place O
with O
very O
nice O
interiors, B-TARGET
warm O
tones. O

Light O
furniture. O

It O
was O
very O
comfortable O
and O
cozy! O

They O
said O
to O
themselves O
that O
the O
hall B-TARGET
would O
be O
a O
fine O
place O
to O
celebrate O
some O
major O
events. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
very O
good O
too!!!!! O

The O
salmon B-TARGET
just O
melted O
in O
his O
mouth, O
Caesar's B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
is O
beyond O
praise! O

My O
companion O
didn't O
refuse O
her O
dessert. O

The O
name O
didn't O
remember, O
but O
it O
looked O
"something" O
beautiful, O
very O
beautiful. O

In O
general, O
it O
was O
a O
very O
good O
evening! O
the O
girl O
also O
enjoyed O
it!!! O

R. O

S. O
Come O
again O
(more O
than O
once) O

I O
recently O
discovered O
this O
parach B-TARGET
cafe, I-TARGET
and O
I O
haven't O
seen O
any O
more O
kitchens O
where O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
cooked O
together. O

I O
was O
watching O
my O
health, O
and O
I O
was O
very O
surprised O
that O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
not O
only O
useful O
but O
also O
very O
tasty. O

Every O
time O
I O
visit O
again, O
I O
try O
to O
try O
new O
dishes O
from O
the O
menu, O
especially O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
caesar, I-TARGET
spinate B-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
blind O
tea, B-TARGET
and O
tyramis B-TARGET
from O
the O
chef. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
with O
a O
friend, O
he O
ordered O
a O
squid. O

In O
general, O
the O
kalyan B-TARGET
boys O
did O
well, O
but O
they O
did O
it O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time. O

Perhaps O
the O
reason O
was O
a O
large O
number O
of O
visitors. O

The B-TARGET
cafe I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
well O
equipped O
with O
restable O
soft B-TARGET
furniture, I-TARGET
the O
table B-TARGET
areas O
are O
separated O
by O
curtains, O
but O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
cool O
when O
the O
front O
door O
opens O
and O
closes O
when O
you O
sit O
near O
the O
entrance. O

Despite O
all O
this, O
it's O
now O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
establishments, B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
to O
all O
my O
acquaintances. O

The O
50th O
anniversary O
was O
celebrated. O

Two O
days O
in O
a O
row. O

I O
really O
liked O
it. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
in O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
with O
toast, O
speech, O
and O
conversation O
(a O
small, O
cozy O
and O
quiet O
room). B-TARGET

There O
was O
no O
need O
to O
reserve O
the O
entire O
room O
because O
of O
the O
small O
number O
of O
visitors. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
surprises O
and O
delights O
the O
eyes, O
gives O
us O
the O
opportunity O
to O
enjoy O
the O
paintings B-TARGET
of O
Peterburg O
artists. O

Kitchen: O
The O
canteen B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
1,800 O
chops O
is O
quite O
suitable O
for O
its O
variety, O
taste, O
and O
quantity. O

Plus, O
it's O
a O
pleasure O
to O
be O
able O
to O
bring O
your O
own O
alcohol O
and O
sweets, O
although O
later O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
the O
chef O
is O
baking O
very O
tasty O
cakes B-TARGET
we O
unfortunately O
didn't O
know O
about O
in O
advance. O

The O
lack O
of O
a O
large O
choice O
of O
hot B-TARGET
(red O
fish O
or O
beef) O
was O
a O
concern, O
but O
the O
large O
portions B-TARGET
and O
fine O
taste O
were O
pleasantly O
impressed. O

A O
company O
of O
14-20 O
people O
was O
served O
by O
two O
waiters. O

High-level O
services B-TARGET
(silent, O
discreet, O
delicate). O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
extra O
food, O
alcohol, O
and O
juice O
were O
packed O
and O
handed O
over. O

There's O
room B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
dancing I-TARGET
if O
you O
want. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
kind O
enough O
to O
let O
you O
play O
any O
music. O

They've O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
they O
haven't. O

I'll O
start O
from O
far O
away) O
and O
I've O
been O
going O
to O
the O
distance O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
and O
a O
half O
years O
ago O
and O
I've O
got O
a O
mixed O
impression O
(if O
you O
like O
it O
or O
not). O

There's O
no, O
uh, O
weird O
staff O
in O
the O
kitchen O
in O
a O
strange O
form, O
and O
there's O
nothing O
to O
serve O
either. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
got O
caught O
is O
the O
design B-TARGET
of O
the O
cafe, O
which O
is O
very O
beautiful. O

Just O
the O
other O
day, O
I O
thought O
I'd O
take O
a O
chance O
and O
come O
in O
for O
a O
break. O

The O
cafe O
could O
only O
be O
identified O
by O
abandoned O
design, O
everything O
else O
changed. O

I O
ordered O
a O
salad, B-TARGET
so O
I O
felt O
sorry O
to O
eat O
it, O
so O
beautifully O
adorned) O
I'm O
not O
saying O
it O
was O
delicious O
anymore. O

The O
non-addictive O
and O
quality O
care B-TARGET
enjoyed O
very O
much. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
your O
comfortable O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
you O
didn't O
even O
want O
to O
leave, O
everything O
was O
so O
warm O
and O
warm!) O

Nice O
place. B-TARGET

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
room, O
both O
in O
the O
halls B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
wardrobe. B-TARGET

At O
three O
o'clock O
on O
a O
dayday, O
the O
people O
were O
almost O
gone. O

It's O
quiet O
and O
quiet. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
went O
to O
the O
table, O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
over O
and O
offered O
a O
menu. O

She O
ordered O
mushroom O
soup O
and O
vegetables O
with O
fish, O
last O
of O
them O
coffee. O

It O
tastes O
good, O
it's O
good, O
it's B-TARGET
full, O
it's O
good O
to O
celebrate. B-TARGET

The O
prices O
are O
medium. O

We'll O
have O
to O
get O
to O
the O
perfomance O
sometime O
in O
the O
evening. O
There's O
a O
pretty O
big O
scene O
here! O

On O
the O
last O
Sunday, O
March O
24th, O
this O
restaurant O
celebrated O
his O
son's O
birthday. O

It O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
pick O
a O
place, O
because O
it's O
not O
easy O
for O
a O
kid's O
party, O
because O
your O
parents O
want O
to O
hang O
out, O
have O
a O
good O
meal, O
finally O
have O
their O
own O
party, O
and O
the O
kids O
want O
to O
get O
mad, O
play, O
and O
they're O
still O
different O
ages, O
who O
cares. O

But O
it's O
not O
wrong, O
it's O
a O
lovely O
children's B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
it's O
a O
wonderful O
nanny, B-TARGET
it's O
all O
kids O
on O
the O
case, O
it's O
shit, O
it's O
making O
stuff, O
it's O
not O
visible, O
it's O
not O
there! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
at O
all O
were O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
whole O
party O
organization O
was O
taken O
over. O

We've O
come O
here O
a O
few O
times, O
we've O
looked O
around, O
the O
table O
has O
been O
chosen, O
so O
they're O
telling O
us O
how O
and O
what O
it's O
best O
to O
do, O
where O
to O
sit, O
at O
what O
time O
to O
start O
the O
party, O
which O
is O
to O
put O
the O
snacks O
on O
the O
table. O

And O
when O
we O
arrived O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
festival, O
even O
with O
balloons O
we O
decorated O
our O
table! O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
it's O
big, O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
nobody O
bothers O
anyone. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
kids O
liked O
the O
pizza, B-TARGET
the O
friends O
praised O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
pasta, I-TARGET
the O
husband O
liked O
the B-TARGET
mushroom I-TARGET
pork, I-TARGET
and O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
salmon O
lasagna, B-TARGET
good O
and O
good. O

It O
wasn't O
cheap, O
but O
it O
was O
worth O
it. O

There's O
no O
headache, O
kids O
happy, O
friends O
liked O
it, O
too. O

It's O
a O
good O
party! O

It's O
a O

We O

the O

the O

They're B-TARGET

they're O
big! O

You O
tried O
the O
local B-TARGET
beer, I-TARGET
you O
liked O
it. O

Easy O
and O
soft. O

It's O
a O
pleasure O
that O
the O
prices O
aren't O
high, O
it's O
a O
five-point O
service. B-TARGET

Waitresses B-TARGET
are O
pretty O
girls. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
fun, O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O

They're O
barely O
parked. O

All O
the O

Didn't O

The O

delicious, O
all O
fresh, O
and O
the O

was O
particularly O
satisfying! O

We've O
visited O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
in O
St. O
Petersburg, O
but O
now O
I'm O
gonna O
tell O
everyone O
to O
go O
to O
this O
wonderful O
place! B-TARGET

Again, O
thank O
you O
for O
coming O
back!!! O

We O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
on O
March O
8 O
the O
three O
of O
us O
on O
coupons. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
big, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
happy, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
careful. O

Waiter B-TARGET
Shahid O
really O
liked O
it, O
answered O
all O
the O
questions O
about O
the O
meal, O
the O
order O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long. O

The B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
meals B-TARGET
are O
big, O
they're O
beautiful, O
they're O
delicious. O

All O
the O
tables O
were O
busy, O
but O
no O
one O
stopped O
talking O
calmly, O
the O
music B-TARGET
wasn't O
loud. O

Very O
tasty O
desserts: B-TARGET
tiramisu, B-TARGET
blueberry B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
and O
black B-TARGET
forest. I-TARGET

At O
the O
price O
of O
the O
coupons, O
it O
was O
quite O
acceptable. O

With O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine, O
salads, O
hot O
and O
desserts, O
there O
were O
less O
than O
1,000 O
rubles O
per O
person. O

We O
ordered O
a O
table O
and O
food O
in O
advance, O
in O
three O
hours O
or O
so. O

Come O
on O
time, O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
table O
and... O

The B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
was O
waiting O
for O
half O
an O
hour, O
she O
came O
running, O
put O
in O
a O
bottle O
of O
vodka O
and O
ducked. O

I O
don't O
drink O
alcohol, O
and O
to O
order O
tea O
and O
lemonade O
for O
my O
daughter, O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bar O
and O
find O
someone O
to O
take O
the O
order. O

We're O
starting O
to O
get O
orders O
for O
the O
tiny O
ones, O
considering O
what O
we O
ordered O
in O
advance. O

I O
waited O
15 O
minutes O
after O
eating O
dessert. O

Garderob: B-TARGET
I O
left O
the O
oak O
room O
three O
times O
and O
two O
of O
them O
watched O
leaving O
people O
wait O
for O
them O
to O
find O
their O
clothes. O

A O
lady O
even O
went O
in O
there O
to O
find O
her O
food O
jacket: O
I O
went O
to O
another O
restaurant O
before, O
the O
menu O
looks O
like O
they O
have O
an O
interior, O
too. O

I O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
eating O
at O
the O
Tea O
House. O
It's O
not O
good. O

And O
I'm O
a O
Chinese O
food O
fan. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
have O
dessert, O
it O
was O
on O
the O
level, O
but O
if O
I O
ate O
the O
same O
one O
in O
another O
restaurant O
for O
120 O
rubles, O
it's O
400, O
the O
difference O
is O
obvious. O

Anyway, O
the O
nerves O
and O
the O
negative O
of O
this O
place, B-TARGET
we O
didn't O
eat, O
but O
we O
waited O
and O
remembered O
what O
was O
ordered. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
down, O
waiters B-TARGET
don't O
have O
a O
smile, O
they O
don't O
have O
a O
service. B-TARGET

I'm O
not O
going O
there O
anymore. O

I've O
been O
at O
this O
restaurant O
four O
times O
since O
December O
last O
year. O

Beautiful O
wine, B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
with O
beautiful O
serve, B-TARGET
calm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
and O
wonderful O
service. B-TARGET

With O
regard O
to O
the O
ratings O
(between O
1 O
and O
10): O
- O
7 O
for O
the O
kitchen O
because O
I'd O
like O
to O
have O
more O
variety O
on O
the O
menu O
on O
the O
main B-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET
- O
5 O
for O
the O
interior B-TARGET
- O
not O
very O
comfortable O
on O
these O
chairs, B-TARGET
the O
purse O
not O
anywhere, O
the O
best O
seats B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
window O
(with O
regard O
to O
comfort) O
- O
10 O
for O
the O
service B-TARGET
- O
always O
careful O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
undetected O
staff, B-TARGET
which O
should O
be O
in O
line O
with O
the O
restaurant O
service. O

It O
was O
a O
Saturday O
night O
birthday O
party O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
express O
my O
great O
gratitude, O
first O
of O
all, O
to O
the O
management B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
which O
serves B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
and, O
of O
course, O
to B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
cooks I-TARGET
who O
make O
the O
customers O
of O
the O
place O
such O
delicious B-TARGET
meals. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
everything. O

Of O
course, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
impressive: O
cozy O
and O
beautiful. O

The O
table B-TARGET
was O
great. O

I'd O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
for O
a O
restaurant O
at O
this O
level, O
the O
prices O
aren't O
high. O

I'd O
like O
to O
get O
back O
into O
the O
unforgettable O
atmosphere B-TARGET
that's O
inherent O
in O
this O
place. O

Just O
the O
other O
day, O
we O
celebrated O
our O
little O
anniversary O
with O
our O
husband, O
two O
years. O

They O
chose O
MacArena B-TARGET
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
and O
they're O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
choice! O

It's B-TARGET
a O
great O
menu, O
so O
many O
things O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
come O
by O
more O
often O
to O
try O
different O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
and O
unusual, O
and O
there's O
a O
lot O
to O
choose O
from. O

They O
ordered O
salads O
from O
tongue O
and O
seafood O
and O
paella O
with O
chicken O
and O
rabbit. O

It's O
really O
good O
and O
it's O
good, O
it's B-TARGET
big, O
it's O
full! O

Nice O
squid, B-TARGET
they've O
enjoyed O
it, O
a O
fine O
young O
man O
who's O
a O
squid, B-TARGET
he's O
nice, O
he's O
helped O
us O
make O
a O
choice O
and O
he's O
not O
done O
it! O

Beautiful O
interior, B-TARGET
on O
the O
second O
floor O
by O
the O
window. O

The O
music B-TARGET
is O
good, O
it's O
not O
loud O
as O
it O
is O
in O
many O
institutions, O
but O
it O
creates O
a O
cozy O
romantic O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
everybody O
smiles, O
keeps O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
table, O
offers O
a B-TARGET
savings I-TARGET
discount, I-TARGET
which O
is O
pretty O
good! O

Anyway, O
thank O
you O
for O
a O
lovely O
evening! O

We're O
your O
regulars O
now! O

They O
came O
to O
visit O
friends O
in O
Peter O
from O
Moscow O
for O
the O
New O
Year O
2013, O
who O
took O
us O
to O
this O
place. B-TARGET

The O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
food, B-TARGET
and O
the O
check B-TARGET
for O
six O
people O
with O
alcohol O
made O
me O
happy O
:) O

It's O
a O
very O
cozy O
place, B-TARGET
but O
the O
restaurant O
area O
is O
small, O
which O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
minus, O
so O
it O
might O
not O
be O
available! O

8th O
is O
past, O
and O
we O
can O
take O
stock. O

Thought O
I'd O
write O
a O
review O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
the O
party O
was O
celebrated, O
read O
the O
reviews O
of O
edik077 O
and O
Rules77777 O
and O
realized O
that O
either O
we O
were O
different O
restaurants, O
or O
the O
guys O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
something. O

But O
now O
it's O
about O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance O
and O
made O
because O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
proposed O
a O
pre-order, O
when O
they O
saw O
a O
fully-filled O
restaurant, O
they O
realized O
that O
the O
advice O
was O
really O
right, O
there O
was O
a O
70-80 O
man O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
and O
a O
really O
hot O
dish O
could O
wait O
very O
long. O

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
quite O
diverse O
and O
delicious, O
and O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
everything O
we O
brought O
and O
brought O
us O
a O
lot. O

The O
service O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
in O
town, O
but O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
did O
everything O
they O
needed. O

I O
gotta O
say, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
anyway, O
not O
for O
very O
long, O
but O
still. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
comfortable O
sofas. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
very O
good O
music B-TARGET
program I-TARGET
and O
a O
fun O
host. B-TARGET

Anyway, O
I O
was O
satisfied O
with O
my O
choice, O
and O
the O
way O
we O
spent O
the O
evening, O
the O
good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
cozy O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
good O
kitchen. O

The O
management B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
of O
SASYBO. O

We O
visited O
this O
wonderful O
restaurant B-TARGET
late O
in O
the O
evening, O
closer O
to O
midnight, O
when O
we O
weren't O
really O
feeding O
anywhere. O

Despite O
the O
bad O
weather, O
we O
tried O
to O
show O
visiting O
relatives O
(juveniles) O
all O
the O
beauty O
of O
our O
city, O
including O
the O
white O
nights. O

Apartment B-TARGET
55 I-TARGET
was O
chosen O
because O
of O
the O
location B-TARGET
and O
schedule O
of O
work, O
and O
the O
reviews O
were O
good. O

They O
often O
passed O
by, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
reason O
to O
come O
in. O

Feeding O
and O
drinking O
us O
on O
this O
cold O
night O
is O
delicious. O

I O
don't O
want O
to O
use O
the O
words O
service, O
service, O
because O
we O
weren't O
"serviced," O
but O
welcome, O
very O
domestic. O

Helped O
with O
the O
order, O
advised O
with O
good O
and O
cheap O
wine. B-TARGET

The O
order O
wasn't O
quick, O
though O
there O
were O
only O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
restaurant O
and O
people O
had O
been O
sitting O
there O
drinking O
tea O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

Salats O
cooked O
for O
20 O
minutes, O
then O
they O
waited O
for O
the O
hottest. O

We O
were O
running O
out O
of O
time O
for O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

The O
guests O
very O
much O
enjoyed O
the O
fire B-TARGET
bunts I-TARGET
and O
the O
stewed B-TARGET
veal. I-TARGET

I've O
been O
taking O
burgeoning B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
grills. I-TARGET
It's O
a O
delight! O

The O
salads B-TARGET
were O
full O
and O
pretty O
tasty, O
but O
they O
didn't O
remember. O

The O
numbers B-TARGET
aren't O
huge, O
but O
they're O
not O
small, O
and O
we're O
full, O
and O
we O
haven't O
decided O
to O
take O
dessert O
yet, O
even O
though O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
at O
advising O
and O
praising O
their O
desserts. O

So O
we O
have O
a O
reason O
to O
come O
back O
to O
the O
apartment B-TARGET
again! O

I O
want O
to O
say O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
to O
the O
night B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
who O
made O
our O
late O
dinner O
so O
pleasant! O

On O
my O
girlfriend's O
birthday, O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant. O

I O
chose O
"Mizzuki" B-TARGET
based O
on O
feedback O
from O
this O
site, O
and O
I O
was O
right-- O
a O
very O
cozy O
place, B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
(ordered O
rolls B-TARGET
and O
rice B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken), I-TARGET
non-addictive O
and O
quiet O
music. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
waitresses, B-TARGET
when O
they O
see O
what O
you're O
looking O
at, O
don't O
pretend O
they O
didn't O
notice, O
but O
they O
go:) O

I O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
order O
more O
than O
you O
expect O
from O
the O
restaurant. O
The O
plates O
came O
up O
just O
when O
I O
first O
thought O
it O
was O
time O
to O
bring O
them O
in.) O

Anyway, O
we O
had O
a O
great O
night, O
so O
I'm O
gonna O
take O
my O
friends O
there O
now. O

We O
were O
with O
our O
husband O
this O
weekend. O

A O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
the O
table O
wasn't O
a O
problem-- O
ordered O
in O
advance. O

The O
order O
was O
long O
enough, O
but O
there's O
no O
rush O
on O
the O
street O
with O
beer O
:) O

We O
liked O
the O
grill, B-TARGET
so O
did O
the O
beer. B-TARGET

Small O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
no O
classic O
beer. B-TARGET

It's O
minuses. O

But O
in O
general, O
the O
impression O
is O
good. O

From O
the O
service, B-TARGET
from O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
from O
the O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

People O
around O
here O
are O
smiling, O
everybody's O
having O
fun, O
the O
music's B-TARGET
nice. O

We'll O
be O
right O
back! O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
Asahi's O
big O
windows O
were O
removed O
from O
the O
deaf O
curtains O
(more O
than O
a O
year O
ago), O
the O
place O
was O
no O
longer O
expensive, O
untasty, O
and O
pophosian. O

Two O
floors, O
very O
calm, O
but O
stylish O
interior, B-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
itself O
suddenly O
has O
the O
power O
to O
spend O
time O
there O
talking, O
and O
"and" O
and O
eat. O

Since O
they O
were O
not O
far O
from O
the O
house, O
they O
loved O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
family O
talks, O
even O
when O
the O
audience O
was O
full O
of O
visitors. O

Service B-TARGET
level. O

And O
they O
meet O
and O
they O
walk, O
and O
they O
repeat O
the O
order, O
and O
the O
order O
is O
respected, O
and O
the O
ashtray O
is O
changed O
without O
further O
request. O

There O
is O
one O
section O
in O
the O
menu, O
except O
for O
Japanese O
food, O
with O
"author" O
European O
food, O
although O
these O
dishes O
are O
much O
longer O
than O
Japanese O
food. O

Sushi B-TARGET
in O
Asahi O
isn't O
good, O
but O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
order O
them O
- O
there's O
great O
rolls, B-TARGET
there's O
gonna O
be O
Philadelphia's B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
in O
whatever O
way O
you O
want, O
and O
there's O
rice-free B-TARGET
rolls, I-TARGET
and O
there's O
good O
salads, O
great O
light O
salads B-TARGET
(with O
salmon, O
crab, O
tuna), O
and O
salads B-TARGET
are O
big, O
and O
out O
of O
hot, O
it's O
teriyaca's B-TARGET
soul. O

Of O
all O
the O
Japanese O
establishments O
in O
the O
Moscow-Electrosil O
area, O
this O
is O
the O
most O
delicious O
crab B-TARGET
soup. I-TARGET

Up O
to O
18 O
hours, O
two O
sushis B-TARGET
at O
the O
price O
of O
one, O
plus O
free O
food O
delivery O
home. O

Anyway, O
a O
decent O
place, B-TARGET
you O
can O
recommend O
both O
for O
negotiation O
and O
for O
a O
romantic O
meeting. O

I'm O
here O
at O
least O
once O
a O
week. O

Good O
afternoon, O
birthday O
in O
mid-November O
(15 O
November, O
Friday). O

There O
were O
five O
of O
us. O

The O
table O
was O
booked O
in O
advance, O
as O
well O
as O
(cold O
snacks, O
hot O
snacks O
and O
drinks). O

Come O
on, O
it's O
all O
done. O

I've O
been O
picking O
a O
restaurant O
long O
enough. O

I O
really O
wanted O
to O
celebrate O
birthday O
at O
a O
nice O
Georgian O
restaurant. O

I've O
looked O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
options, O
I've O
read O
enough O
reviews O
on O
the O
Internet, O
and O
I've O
stopped O
at O
the O
KET O
restaurant. O

And O
that O
was O
great! O

A O
very O
cozy, O
small O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
calm, O
warm. O

Very O
nice. O

There's O
not O
much O
table. O

Very O
polite, O
pleasant O
staff. B-TARGET

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
young O
man O
(unfortunately, O
I O
don't O
remember O
his O
name). O

Everything O
was O
at O
the O
highest O
level!! O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
amazing! O

My O
guests O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
everything O
very O
much. O

Plus, O
there O
was O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
) O

We O
danced O
a O
lot. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
we O
were O
the O
most O
active O
and O
noisy O
in O
this O
respect.)) O

But O
we O
really O
wanted O
to O
dance O
because O
the O
singer O
performed O
very O
good O
songs! B-TARGET

Couldn't O
sit O
down) O

Anyway, O
I'm O
very O
happy O
that O
my O
birthday O
was O
at O
the O
KET B-TARGET
restaurant. I-TARGET

Impressive, O
my O
guests O
and O
I O
have O
some O
wonderful O
ones O
left!!! O

I O
advise O
you O
to O
visit O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
)))) O

I'd O
love O
to O
come O
again! O

P. O

S. O

Thank O
you O
to O
the O
entire O
restaurant B-TARGET
team!!!! I-TARGET

Everything O
was O
very O
and O
very O
wonderful!!!!!! O

We O
had O
a O
wedding O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
Friday. O

There O
weren't O
many O
guests, O
they O
just O
booked O
a O
table. O

Have O
a O
great O
time. O

Good O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
maintenance, B-TARGET
nice O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

I O
was O
very O
happy O
to O
have O
a O
gift B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
chef O
for O
the O
young. O

Thank O
you O
so O
much! O

I O
suggest O
you O
all O
go O
there, O
the O
prices O
are O
acceptable. O

And O
on O
Friday O
night O
and O
Saturday, O
the O
dance O
show O
and O
live O
music. O

I O
live O
near O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
often O
come O
here O
with O
family O
or O
friends O
because O
we O
can O
always O
have O
a O
good O
meal O
and O
have O
a O
pleasant O
evening. O

It's O
a O
very O
varied O
menu, B-TARGET
so O
we O
haven't O
tried O
it O
yet. O

It's O
a O
pleasure O
to O
have O
Japanese B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Italian I-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

Suitable O
for O
all) O

Pasta B-TARGET
and O
sushi B-TARGET
are O
always O
great! O

I O
really O
like O
the B-TARGET
grill. I-TARGET

Anyway, O
the O
food B-TARGET
of O
no O
one's O
claims. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
itself O
is O
calm O
and O
pleasant. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
considerate O
but O
hateful. O

It O
is O
a O
pleasure O
to O
attend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
)))) O

There O
was O
a O
reservation O
last O
weekend O
(30.08.14), O
a O
small O
company. O

We O
wanted O
new O
impressions, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
we O
got O
them O
from O
full O
strength! O

We O
were O
served O
by O
the O
chef O
at O
the O
restaurant O
(he O
has O
a O
red O
bandage O
and O
the O
rest O
are O
yellow). O

A O
nice O
man, B-TARGET
even O
though O
he O
didn't O
understand O
Russian-- O
we O
found O
common O
ground. O

It's O
very O
virtuoso, O
and O
most O
of O
all, O
he O
cooked O
us O
delicacy. O

They O
were O
very O
interested O
in O
watching O
a O
professional O
in O
their O
business. O

To O
be O
honest, O
cooked O
dishes B-TARGET
taste O
like O
food O
in O
Thai O
restaurants, O
though O
the O
meat B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
didn't O
work O
out O
very O
well. O

When O
we O
booked O
the O
table, O
the O
administrator O
warned O
us O
that, O
apart O
from O
the O
beer, O
their O
liquor O
products O
were O
not O
for O
sale, O
but O
they O
could O
probably O
bring O
them O
with O
them O
by O
paying O
a O
little O
extra. O

Pleasant, O
uncompressive O
view B-TARGET
of O
the O
room, O
cozy O
and O
non-intrusive. O

Special O
thanks O
to O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
Oksane-- O
practically O
kept O
up O
with O
us. O

There's O
a O
small O
aquarium O
in O
the O
hall O
where O
a O
pretty O
big O
fish O
swims, O
so O
there's O
a O
man O
who's O
probably O
a O
little O
drunk-- O
from O
this O
fish O
he O
couldn't O
get O
away O
with, O
you O
know, O
to O
her O
god, O
like O
he O
came O
to O
the O
zoo! O

Well, O
it's O
all O
very O
good, O
you're O
prosperous! O

We'd O
love O
to O
come O
to O
you O
again! O

I O
was O
at O
the O
restaurant O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
with O
a O
girl. O

It's B-TARGET
nice, O
it's O
my O
personal O
taste, O
but O
the O
1990s O
TV B-TARGET
in O
the O
room O
surprised O
me, O
and O
the O
picture O
is O
complemented O
by O
the O
non-working O
fountain B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room. O

And O
the O
background B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
was O
radio. O

The O
order O
was O
received O
quickly... O
and O
that O
service B-TARGET
is O
over. O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
minutes O
for O
tea, O
bring O
a O
salad. O

I O
can't O
say O
what's O
cooking O
badly, O
it's O
edible. O

Rhys O
also O
waited O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
minutes O
with O
tea, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
Chinese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
east, O
as O
the O
dishes O
are O
being O
processed, O
we O
all O
know O
that O
everything O
is O
always O
adorned O
and O
looks O
delicious, O
so O
we O
brought O
rice B-TARGET
on O
a O
plate O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
I O
didn't O
even O
eat O
it. O

It's O
like O
the O
rice B-TARGET
that O
was O
raised O
from O
the O
floor O
was O
a O
huge O
lump. O

Anyway, O
after O
that, O
they O
paid O
the O
bill O
and O
left... O

Worked, O
one, O
another O
waitress, B-TARGET
and O
everyone O
thought O
we'd O
already O
been O
served O
and O
ordered. O

I'd O
understand O
that O
if O
there O
was O
an O
ashlag, O
so O
with O
us, O
the O
whole O
restaurant O
was O
full O
of O
three O
to O
five O
tables. O

Recently, O
they O
came O
to O
Prague O
with O
their O
young O
man. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
be O
surprised O
at O
the O
change O
of O
interior. B-TARGET

It's O
been O
very O
cozy O
and O
comfortable. O

Wooden O
tables B-TARGET
and O
chairs B-TARGET
fit O
perfectly O
into O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
this O
institution. O

I O
liked O
the O
service, B-TARGET
too. O

The B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
friendly. O

Uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O

uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh, O
uh... O

We O
picked O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
but O
they O
weren't O
available. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
it O
was O
due O
to O
a O
change O
of O
menu O
because O
the O
chef O
changed O
and O
that O
the O
new O
menu O
was O
in O
the O
press, O
so O
some O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
missing. O

It O
was O
recommended O
to O
order O
a O
new O
Chef O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
breasts I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
oranges I-TARGET
– O
very O
good, O
very O
good. O

They O
also O
tried O
their O
brand O
roll, B-TARGET
which O
(as O
it O
says O
on O
the O
menu) O
was O
prepared O
according O
to O
the O
Czech O
recipe O
— O
REALLY!!!! O

Unfortunately, O
I've O
never O
been O
to O
Prague, O
but O
I O
wanted O
to O
compare O
it O
to O
the O
real O
one. O

Beer. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
you O
can O
order O
a O
three-litre O
tower, O
you O
can O
pour O
your O
own O
beer O
in O
a O
glass, O
you O
could O
drink O
Pilzner B-TARGET
-- O
that O
tastes O
pretty O
good, O
but O
it's O
kind O
of O
bitter O
for O
me, O
I O
guess. O

I've O
tried O
another O
beer, B-TARGET
I've O
chosen O
cherry, B-TARGET
I've O
really O
enjoyed O
its O
unusual O
taste, O
all O
the O
girls O
I O
suggest. O

Anyway, O
it's O
been O
a O
pleasure O
tonight, O
but O
I'd O
like O
to O
try O
the O
dishes O
from O
the O
new O
menu. O

A O
small O
and O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

At O
the O
entrance, O
we O
were O
met O
by O
an O
elegant O
man B-TARGET
who O
took O
up O
his O
clothes O
and O
walked O
us O
into O
the O
hall. O

Later, O
looking O
at O
the O
pictures O
on O
the O
walls, O
they O
saw O
the O
man O
in O
question, O
and O
they O
realized O
it O
was O
the O
owner O
himself. O

The O
guest O
host B-TARGET
means O
a O
lot, O
that's O
something O
I've O
never O
seen O
in O
Peter. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
nice O
enough O
inside, O
but O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
small, O
the O
four O
at O
the O
same O
table O
are O
a O
little O
tight, O
especially O
when O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
dishes. O

The O
restaurant O
menu O
is O
sophisticated O
enough, O
but O
it O
doesn't O
shine O
10 O
salads, O
10 O
second O
dishes, O
etc. O

You O
could O
say O
it's O
even O
modest. O

But, O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
in O
it O
is O
excellent, O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
in O
it O
are O
delicious O
and O
delicious. O

It's O
the O
first O
time O
I've O
tried O
marble O
beef, O
I've O
seen O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
in O
some O
restaurants, O
but O
I've O
decided O
to O
try O
it. O

Bludo B-TARGET
was O
the O
gentlest, O
thawing O
in O
his O
mouth! O

The O
numbers B-TARGET
are O
small, O
but O
they're O
not O
small, O
the O
best O
thing O
to O
eat O
is O
what O
you O
ordered. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
very O
comfortable, O
making O
yourself O
at O
home. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

But O
I'll O
tell O
you O
what, O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
cheap, O
it's O
a O
model O
account O
of O
2,000 O
rubles O
per O
person. O

Although, O
if O
you O
do O
not O
look O
at O
the O
price, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
can O
safely O
be O
recommended O
for O
a O
visit. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
I'm O
gonna O
put O
on O
my O
white O
list, O
and O
I'm O
always O
gonna O
have O
it O
in O
mind. O

Beautiful. O

It's O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
"at O
the O
level." O

At O
this O
level, O
it's O
focused, O
not O
on O
the O
client. O
) O

We O
got O
here O
at O
23:00, O
on O
a O
day O
off, O
to O
eat O
the O
two O
of O
us. O

The O
restaurant O
gave O
the O
impression O
that O
it O
was O
empty, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
by O
looking O
at O
the O
visitors O
that O
you O
could O
see. O

There O
were O
clearly O
more O
staff B-TARGET
than O
guests. O

We O
went O
upstairs, O
met O
a O
girl, O
offered O
us O
a O
few O
little O
tables. O

We O
wanted O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
big O
table O
with O
the O
couchs. O

I O
really O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the O
couch) O

The O
girl B-TARGET
absolutely O
said, O
"No, O
big O
tables O
are O
for O
big O
companies, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
is O
reserved." O

It's O
funny, O
one's O
busy, O
one's O
reserved, O
and O
there's O
a O
few O
more O
empty, O
but O
we O
can't O
sit O
where O
we O
like, O
because O
there's O
only O
two O
of O
us. O

All O
of O
a O
sudden, O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
the O
ash O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
happens O
at O
midnight, O
well, O
let's O
not O
take O
up O
so O
much O
space. O

Of O
course O
no O
one O
else O
showed O
up O
before O
closing. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
really O
good. O

Music, B-TARGET
too. O

Good O
afternoon! O

The O
first O
time O
I O
wrote O
a O
review O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
I O
was O
so O
impressed O
by O
the O
place. B-TARGET

Beautiful O
kitchen, B-TARGET
cozy O
interior, B-TARGET
benevolent O
waiters, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

You O
can't O
get O
out O
of O
there O
with O
a O
bad O
mood O
and O
hungry, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
very O
large!) O

Especially O
did O
the O
price O
tag... O
quality O
food B-TARGET
for O
a O
little O
money. O

Walked O
with O
a O
young O
man, O
ordered O
an O
omelet B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Bavarian I-TARGET
260r, O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
warm I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
liver I-TARGET
260r, O
beer B-TARGET
0.5l O
220r O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
250r, O
all O
together O
cost O
only O
990p. O

In O
general, O
the O
impression O
is O
beautiful, O
let's O
go O
in O
again!!! O
())) O

We O
were O
with O
friends O
at O
Metropol's B-TARGET
pub, I-TARGET
and O
everything O
was O
very O
good. O

On O
the O
way O
in, O
the O
door O
opens O
the O
door O
of O
the O
door O
door, O
next O
to O
the O
hostess O
counter, O
all O
very O
polite, O
spacious O
wardrobe, B-TARGET
beautiful O
ladder. B-TARGET

The O
interior's B-TARGET
on O
a O
very O
decent O
level, O
and O
it O
feels O
like O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
holding O
its O
mark. O

There O
are O
big O
wooden O
tables B-TARGET
in O
the O
pub, O
comfortable O
chairs, B-TARGET
there O
are O
TVs, B-TARGET
and O
there O
was O
a O
concert O
that O
day. O

Non-addictive O
and O
helpful O
waiter, B-TARGET
didn't O
even O
record O
our O
order, O
memorized O
everything, O
apparently O
knows O
what O
he's O
doing:) O

I'll O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
prices, O
it's O
not O
a O
diner, O
so O
for O
a O
nice O
beer O
dinner, O
one O
person O
needs O
at O
least O
1,500 O
rubles. O

But O
if O
you O
really O
want O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
evening O
in O
a O
decent O
place, B-TARGET
it's O
worth O
it. O

The O
pores B-TARGET
aren't O
small, O
but O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
dishes O
haven't O
been O
cooked O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time, O
we O
haven't O
had O
time O
to O
get O
tired O
of O
waiting. O

Anyway, O
the O
impressions O
from O
the O
pub B-TARGET
are O
positive, O
thank O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
complex O
for O
trying O
to O
make O
customers O
happy!!! O

Special O
thanks O
for O
the O
beauty, B-TARGET
for O
the O
interior! B-TARGET

We O
came O
in O
with O
a O
young O
man O
one O
Saturday O
night, O
fearing O
there O
wouldn't O
be O
a O
seat O
because O
we O
didn't O
have O
a O
reservation O
in O
advance. O

Our O
fears O
were O
in O
vain, O
the O
places O
were... O

And O
to O
be O
precise, O
we O
entered O
a O
completely O
empty O
room O
- O
cute, O
half O
dark, O
with O
a O
nice O
decor, B-TARGET
but O
suspiciously O
deserted. O

When O
we O
picked O
a O
table B-TARGET
we O
sat O
down O
and O
there O
was O
a B-TARGET
waitress I-TARGET
who O
brought O
me O
a O
menu O
and O
answered O
my O
questions O
about O
bringing O
oysters. O

I'm O
gonna O
point O
out O
the O
service-- B-TARGET
there's O
nothing O
to O
go O
on, O
it's O
clear, O
it's O
non-intrusive; O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
hasn't O
been O
hot O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
but O
it's O
nothing. O

So, O
we O
got O
the O
oysters. O

I'm O
fresh, O
my O
companion O
is O
baked. O

I O
can't O
say O
they're O
the O
best O
oysters B-TARGET
of O
my O
life, O
but O
they're O
pretty O
good O
in O
general. O

As O
a O
hot B-TARGET
meal O
of O
Norwegian B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp, I-TARGET
it's O
a O
lovely O
dish. O

My O
companion, O
having O
decided O
not O
to O
experiment O
anymore, O
seems O
to O
have O
taken O
pasta) O

I'd O
like O
some O
more O
tea O
with O
desserts O
later, O
but, O
alas, O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
weren't O
at O
all... O

Except O
strawberry O
soup O
and O
ice O
cream. O

Well, O
it's O
all O
very O
decent. O

I'm O
not O
gonna O
go O
to O
this O
place O
often, O
but O
I'm O
probably O
gonna O
go O
over O
there O
again O
one O
day. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
friend O
yesterday O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

This O
isn't O
the O
first O
time O
we've O
been O
there. O

And O
the O
first O
thing O
that O
hits O
you O
when O
you O
enter O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
wonderful O
very O
unusual O
interior, B-TARGET
nothing O
like O
this O
in O
our O
town's O
restaurants. O

The O
next O
thing O
you O
pay O
attention O
to O
when O
you O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
very O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
always O
smiling O
and O
ready O
to O
help O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
food. O

Now O
it's O
about O
food. O

I've O
already O
tried O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

And O
I O
always O
like O
it O
very O
much. O

For O
example, O
yesterday O
I O
ordered O
salmon B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
and O
ravioli B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushrooms. I-TARGET

It's O
very O
big, O
it's O
delicious. O

At O
Roll B-TARGET
& I-TARGET
Roll, I-TARGET
I O
always O
order O
new O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
confidence, O
because O
I O
have O
never O
once O
been O
disappointed O
in O
my O
choice. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
offers O
a O
large O
choice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
alcohol I-TARGET
at O
a O
reasonable O
price: B-TARGET
many O
varieties O
of O
spill B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
and O
an O
extensive O
wine B-TARGET
map. I-TARGET

And O
you O
can O
also O
try O
some O
very O
tasty O
cocktails B-TARGET
cooked O
by O
a O
bartender. O

The B-TARGET
Roll I-TARGET
& O
Roll O
restaurant O
has O
become O
not O
only O
a O
favourite O
restaurant O
in O
this O
area, O
but O
also, O
perhaps, O
in O
the O
city. O

I O
like O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
I've O
been O
there O
twice, O
and O
I O
guess O
I'll O
come O
again. O

It's O
a O
very O
tasty O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
so O
big O
that O
when O
you O
eat O
salad, O
it's O
hard O
to O
piss O
off O
the O
main O
dish...) O

I O
think O
men O
are O
gonna O
like O
the O
size O
of O
the O
servings, B-TARGET
though! O

Good O
wine. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice-- O
really, O
I O
liked O
the O
first B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
better-- O
he's O
more O
of O
a O
restaurant O
type, O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
like O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
second O
interior-like B-TARGET
Greek O
tavern. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
worthy-- O
nice O
waitresses, B-TARGET
all O
without O
delay, O
all O
with O
a O
smile. O

Anyway, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
warm. O

The O
family O
celebration O
was O
celebrated O
in O
Amadeus O
on O
30 O
May. O

Finally, O
we O
found O
the O
right O
time O
to O
leave O
our O
review O
and O
express O
our O
gratitude O
to O
this O
beautiful O
restaurant! B-TARGET

A O
very O
beautiful O
and O
cozy O
fireplace, B-TARGET
beautiful O
decor B-TARGET
and O
interior! B-TARGET

It's O
the O
fireplace B-TARGET
we've O
chosen O
to O
celebrate. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
associate O
myself O
with O
all O
the O
positive O
comments O
addressed O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
work O
with O
Administrator B-TARGET
Sergei, O
and O
I O
would O
like O
to O
express O
a O
separate O
appreciation O
for O
his O
efforts O
and O
efforts O
in O
organizing O
and O
hosting O
the O
celebration O
directly. O

All O
our O
wishes O
and O
comments O
have O
been O
taken O
into O
account O
by O
Sergei O
up O
to O
the O
point. O

A O
very O
friendly O
and O
thoughtful O
group B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
waiters, I-TARGET
everything O
was O
during O
and, O
by O
the O
way, O
from O
serving B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
to O
basic O
purity O
on O
tables. O

It O
was O
nice O
to O
talk O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
- O
polite, O
smiling O
and O
friendly. O

I O
liked O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
- O
a O
very O
beautiful O
collection B-TARGET
and O
meal, B-TARGET
and O
the O
taste B-TARGET
of O
the O
meal O
left O
the O
most O
positive O
impressions, O
was O
tasty O
and O
relatively O
inexpensive. O

Anyway, O
we've O
been O
very O
and O
very O
pleased, O
thank O
you O
very O
much!!! O

P. O

S. O

Well, O
I O
just O
can't O
shut O
up O
about O
another O
pleasant O
moment-- O
the O
day O
the O
restaurant O
celebrated, O
there O
was O
a O
gift O
bag O
left O
behind,& O
which O
wasn't O
lost O
at O
all! O

The O
next O
day, O
Administrator B-TARGET
Sergei O
contacted O
us O
and O
made O
us O
happy O
with O
the O
good O
news! O

They O
came O
to O
this O
place O
on O
June O
4, O
2014 O
to O
eat O
shabby... O

They O
ordered O
beef O
and O
pork. O

The O
sitters O
were O
waiting O
for O
30 O
minutes, O
and O
then O
a O
man B-TARGET
came O
up O
to O
us O
and O
said O
that O
he O
was O
very O
sorry O
and O
that O
the O
barbecue O
would O
be O
brought... O
in O
about O
10 O
minutes, O
we O
were O
brought O
cold O
meat B-TARGET
(which O
we O
took O
two O
different O
things)... O

When O
we O
said O
that O
the O
barbecue B-TARGET
was O
cold O
again, O
the O
same O
man B-TARGET
apologized O
to O
us O
and O
offered O
to O
warm O
it O
up... O
it O
tasted B-TARGET
like O
shit O
(my O
husband O
half O
just O
didn't O
eat, O
although O
there's O
usually O
everything O
that's O
not O
fixed)... O

It's O
the O
only O
place B-TARGET
we O
haven't O
left O
for O
tea O
in O
five O
years! O

I O
don't O
recommend O
any O
food O
from O
this O
place. B-TARGET

We O
got O
our O
bill O
in O
a O
minute, O
though. O

We've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
cafe O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

The O
impressions B-TARGET
are O
only O
good, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
helps O
to O
relax, O
very O
cozy. O

They O
cook O
nicely O
and O
fast O
enough, O
in O
my O
eyes. O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
nice, O
funny O
girl B-TARGET
who O
was O
able O
to O
bring O
food, O
and O
cocktails O
to O
get O
in O
the O
way, O
and O
she O
gave O
us O
a O
discount. B-TARGET

That's O
where O
I'm O
going O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O
