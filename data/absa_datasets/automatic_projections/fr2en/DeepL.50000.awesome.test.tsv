After O
the O
letter O
carrier's O
palace, O
we O
arrive O
at O
the O
halte O
which O
is O
a O
decent O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
owner B-TARGET
welcomes O
us O
very O
warmly O
and O
it O
is O
his O
wife O
who O
cooks. O

Not O
everything O
is O
homemade O
but O
it's O
good. O

The O
price O
is O
a O
bit O
high O
for O
a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
didn't O
require O
any O
involvement O
from O
start O
to O
finish. O

Local O
pizzas B-TARGET
that O
you O
won't O
eat O
anywhere O
else, O
accommodating O
local O
specialties. O

Even O
the O
restaurant O
owner O
next O
door O
eats O
one O
on O
occasion. O

Very O
good O
welcome B-TARGET

The O
setting B-TARGET
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
pleasant. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
wait B-TARGET
is O
endless O
for O
a O
salad O
with O
an O
industrial O
sauce, B-TARGET
and O
ravioli B-TARGET
in O
a O
bath O
of O
uncooked O
cream. B-TARGET

Yuck. O

In O
the O
center O
of O
this O
very O
small O
village, O
we O
did O
not O
expect O
to O
eat O
so O
well O
on O
a O
pleasant O
terrace. B-TARGET

Pleasant O
service. B-TARGET

Faded O
salad, B-TARGET
average O
wine, B-TARGET
edible B-TARGET
ravioli I-TARGET
gratin. I-TARGET

Good O
ice B-TARGET
cream. O

Neglected O
terrace. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
pity, O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
ideal O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
rather O
nice O
but O
that's O
not O
everything! O

If O
you O
are O
on O
vacation, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
waste O
while O
watching O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
and O
waiters B-TARGET
(who O
are O
charming O
by O
the O
way) O
fluttering O
around O
like O
flies O
not O
knowing O
what O
to O
do O
or O
for O
whom O
(1 O
hour O
for O
3 O
cold O
chops, B-TARGET
and O
the O
next O
day, O
¾ O
of O
an O
hour O
for O
3 O
ice O
creams O
that O
never O
arrived...!), O
long O
wait B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
a O
horrifying O
music B-TARGET
(boom, O
boom, O
boom, O
without O
ceasing). O

One O
is O
reassured O
"the O
boss, B-TARGET
questioned, O
is O
going O
to O
make O
investigations" O
(sic), O
in O
short O
it O
is O
PERFECT. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
in O
a O
reasonable O
time, O
even O
with O
a O
choice O
of O
dishes, O
then O
Flee. O

I O
quickly O
recommend O
an O
organizational O
audit. O

Too O
bad O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

A O
beginning O
of O
evening O
which O
starts O
in O
a O
good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
as O
the O
1st O
times O
a O
Virgin O
Colada O
to O
put O
itself O
in O
appetite O
and O
a O
reception B-TARGET
always O
very O
cordial O
of O
the O
owner B-TARGET
and O
his O
wife. B-TARGET

The O
salmon B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
is O
extra O
but O
for O
a O
change O
I O
test O
the O
pan B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
scallops I-TARGET
at O
22 O
euros O
with O
the O
gratin B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
(potato O
and O
sweet O
potato) O
the O
nice O
marriage O
and O
French O
fries. O

What O
happiness O
in O
the O
plate, B-TARGET
the O
cooking O
of O
my O
nuts B-TARGET
are O
perfect, O
slightly O
pearly O
inside, O
soft O
as O
desired O
... O
the, O
light B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

I O
leave O
very O
satisfied O
with O
my O
very O
good O
dish. B-TARGET

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
put O
in O
my O
top O
five. O

Final O
note O
of O
31e O
for O
a O
cocktail, O
a O
dish O
and O
a O
coffee. O

A O
good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

Good O
Creole B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

We O
ate O
with O
our O
children O
who O
also O
appreciated. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
rather O
cold, O
but O
the O
plates B-TARGET
are O
well O
garnished. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
above O
the O
market, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
guaranteed. O

The O
aperitif B-TARGET
is O
amazing: O
you O
are O
served O
a O
bottle O
of O
1 O
liter O
of O
rum O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
liquid O
cane O
sugar. O

What O
to O
brighten O
up O
the O
day... O

Having O
come O
without O
conviction, O
we O
chose O
to O
test O
the O
new O
kitchen O
of O
the O
bar'oc. O

We O
lived O
an O
extraordinary O
culinary O
experience. O

An O
impeccable O
service B-TARGET
and O
amazing O
cocktails. B-TARGET

But O
the O
ultimate O
was O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
starters. B-TARGET

The O
foi B-TARGET
gras I-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
on O
the O
island. O

The O
carpaccio B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wild I-TARGET
scallops I-TARGET
is O
divine. O

Then O
came O
the O
pluma O
of O
pata O
negra O
with O
its O
incredible O
purée B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
oil. I-TARGET

Thank O
you O
Rodolphe O
for O
this O
incredible O
meal. B-TARGET

To O
be O
experienced O
absolutely. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
-at O
first O
sight- O
rather O
attractive, O
but O
it O
is O
without O
counting O
on O
the O
unavailability O
of O
many O
foods B-TARGET
(lambi, O
marlin O
and O
tuna O
that O
evening), O
and O
the O
mind-boggling O
prices O
of O
others O
(in O
particular O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
"platters", I-TARGET
which O
are O
in O
fact O
only O
small O
plates). O

My O
choice O
was O
therefore O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood I-TARGET
(2 O
overcooked O
mussels, B-TARGET
3 O
thawed O
scallops, B-TARGET
and O
way O
too O
much O
garlic). O

Very O
noisy O
room B-TARGET
(we O
couldn't O
hear O
each O
other O
anymore), O
but O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
sumptuous, O
the O
meal B-TARGET
is O
very O
correct. O

Good O
lasagna B-TARGET
and O
a O
pleasant B-TARGET
coffee... I-TARGET

But O
if O
the O
very O
relaxed O
service B-TARGET
is O
nice... O

It O
lacks O
professionalism... O

Result O
of O
the O
cocktails O
taken O
for O
the O
aperitif O
served O
with O
the O
dishes... O

I O
didn't O
take O
any O
pleasure O
in O
having O
my O
mojito O
with O
my O
lasagna... O
which O
I O
waited O
for O
nearly O
30 O
minutes... O

In O
short, O
it's O
a O
shame. O

We O
did O
not O
eat, O
we O
drank O
water O
and O
oil. O

Milanese B-TARGET
cutlet I-TARGET
breaded O
on O
one O
side O
only O
and O
full O
of O
oil. O

Entrecote B-TARGET
with O
more O
nerves O
than O
meat O
and O
so O
on. O

a O
restaurant O
that O
will O
delight O
the O
taste O
buds O
with O
very O
well O
cooked O
products. B-TARGET

but O
a O
disaster O
on O
the O
service B-TARGET
side: O
we O
were O
forgotten O
in O
a O
corner, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
tables O
on O
the O
right O
and O
on O
the O
left O
had O
right O
to O
all O
the O
respects O
(you O
have O
to O
be O
American O
or O
large O
family O
to O
be O
interesting O
must O
believe!) O

we O
didn't O
have O
an O
ice O
bucket O
for O
the O
white O
wine, O
no O
bread O
during O
the O
meal, O
we O
had O
to O
get O
up O
to O
call O
out O
to O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
who O
didn't O
even O
look O
at O
us, O
we O
waited O
a O
lot O
between O
the O
dishes O
so O
that O
they O
would O
deign O
to O
take O
away O
the O
empty O
plates... O
in O
short! O

a O
tasty O
evening O
spoiled O
by O
these O
very O
unpleasant O
side O
effects O

Just O
a O
call O
to O
reserve O
and O
to O
know O
if O
they O
are O
opened O
compared O
to O
the O
opinion O
of O
tripadvisor. O

The O
person O
on O
the O
phone O
is O
cold O
and O
we O
have O
the O
impression O
of O
being O
disturbed O
and O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
closes O
around O
2am, O
we O
are O
informed O
that O
there O
is O
just O
one O
entrecote O
left O
(I'll O
put O
it O
aside O
if O
you O
come) O
and O
then O
I O
have O
only O
omelettes, O
ceps, O
cheese, O
ham. O

Personally, O
if O
you're O
going O
to O
eat O
an O
omelet O
in O
a O
restaurant, O
you O
might O
as O
well O
eat O
at O
home. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful, O
the O
plate B-TARGET
is O
divine, O
the O
wines B-TARGET
overwhelming, O
add O
to O
that O
the O
contagious O
enthusiasm O
of O
the O
owner: O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for? O

We O
are O
so O
well O
at O
the O
Art B-TARGET
dit I-TARGET
Vin, I-TARGET
we O
spend O
good O
moments O
there O
:) O

nice O
welcome B-TARGET
by O
2 O
seniors O
who O
make O
you O
feel O
at O
ease O

The O
value O
for O
money O
is O
at O
the O
top O
with O
a O
local O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
a O
manual O
air O
conditioning O
which O
requires O
an O
explanation O

It O
is O
about O
2*2 O
fixed O
wooden O
panels O
in O
the O
ceiling O
with O
at O
their O
base O
a O
band O
of O
floating O
fabric O
manipulated O
by O
a O
hidden O
slave O
and O
which O
gets O
a O
real O
current O
of O
fresh O
air O

To O
avoid O
a O
too O
big O
demand O
incompatible O
with O
their O
size O
of O
oven, O
the O
breath O
to O
the O
big O
margnier O
does O
not O
appear O
has O
the O
card B-TARGET
also O
envisage O
to O
order O
it O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
meal O

An O
originality: O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
are O
counted O
separately, O
probably O
to O
avoid O
increasing O
the O
price O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET

An O
old O
fashioned O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
charm O

Generally O
I O
only O
write O
reviews O
when O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied. O

If O
I O
am, O
I O
tell O
myself O
that O
I O
have O
fallen O
on O
the O
wrong O
day O
or O
on O
the O
wrong O
dish, O
but O
here O
I O
can't O
hold O
back! O

We O
were O
attracted O
by O
the O
rather O
good O
prices. O

But O
what O
a O
mistake! O

We O
each O
took O
a O
menu O
at O
25euros. O

The O
seafood B-TARGET
appetizer I-TARGET
was O
disgusting O
(is O
it O
fresh?). O

The O
chipirons B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
ink I-TARGET
were O
sweet O
and O
tasteless O
(probably O
frozen), O
the O
fisherman's B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
better, O
but O
you O
could O
tell O
that O
nothing O
was O
fresh O
or O
prepared O
on O
the O
spot O
and O
that O
they O
used O
poor O
quality O
products. B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
edible. O

The O
service B-TARGET
didn't O
really O
raise O
the O
level. O

I O
was O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
leave! O

A O
touch O
of O
humor: O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
it O
is O
written O
that O
the O
products O
are O
prepared O
according O
to O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
chef. O

He O
must O
not O
be O
doing O
well! O

It O
is O
also O
written: O
"our O
priority: O
to O
satisfy O
you". O

What O
a O
joke! O

They O
have O
no O
shame! O

We O
took O
the O
discovery B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
at O
20 O
euros O
and O
we O
were O
not O
disappointed. O
Anchovies, O
axoa, O
potatoes, O
cheese, O
salad, O
etc... O
copious O
and O
especially O
good. O
Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
well O
cooked. O
The O
sangria B-TARGET
was O
perfect. O

restaurant O
in O
a O
charming O
little O

street I-TARGET

Saint O
Jean O
de O
Luz. O

surprise O
even O
before O
placing O
the O
order: O
a O
spider O
was O
lodged O
in O
the O
menu! O
As O
soon O
as O
the O
aperitif O
was O
served, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
brought O
us O
the O
fish O
soups! O

Error O
quickly O
rectified O
by O
the O
owner. B-TARGET

I O
ordered O
a O
blue O
duck B-TARGET
breast O
with O
french O
fries, O
but O
it O
was O
served O
with O
potato O
gratin. O

It O
went O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
to O
be O
served O
with O
french O
fries O
and O
when O
it O
came O
back O
to O
me, O
it O
was O
cold O
!!! O
frankly O
not O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
I O
will O
return O
! O

In O
addition O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
is O
not O
even O
pleasant O
and O
smiling O

We O
liked O
everything. O

The O
setting, B-TARGET
dinner O
by O
the O
pool. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
which O
would O
deserve O
a O
Michelin O
star. O

The O
associations O
of O
flavors O
and O
impeccable O
cooking. O

This O
restaurant O
on O
the O
port O
attracted O
our O
attention O
by O
the O
sobriety O
of O
its O
menu. B-TARGET

Our O
choice O
was O
the O
daily O
menu O
at O
17.50 O
€ O
(starter O
+ O
main O
course) O

Because O
of O
the O
heat O
we O
were O
kindly O
advised O
to O
take O
a O
table O
in O
the O
air-conditioned O
room. O

The O
aperitif O
was O
a O
little O
accelerated O
by O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
visibly O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
finish O
his O
service O
and O
who O
came O
to O
propose O
us O
to O
taste O
the O
wine O
while O
we O
only O
started O
to O
taste O
the O
tapenade O
toast. O

( O
quickly O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
chef B-TARGET
) O

The O
rest O
is O
happier O
with O

As O
a O
starter, O
an O
assortment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Corsican I-TARGET
charcuterie I-TARGET
and O
excellent O
cheese B-TARGET
fritters. I-TARGET

Then O
a O
sea O
bream B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
with O
small O
vegetables: O
nicely O
presented O
and O
very O
tasty. O

In O
the O
end O
a O
good O
table B-TARGET
to O
discover! O

The O
title O
sums O
it O
all O
up O

bad O
service B-TARGET

excessive O
price O
for O
the O
service O

Old O
mutton O
instead O
of O
lamb B-TARGET

Corsican B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
worse O
than O

plate I-TARGET
in O
the O
singular O
..... O

I O
went O
there O
several O
times O
last O
year O
and O
it O
was O
very O
good O
but O
I O
think O
something O
has O
changed O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
compared O
to O
last O
year O
because O
it O
has O
become O
a O
real O
nightmare. O

Pizza B-TARGET
with O
rubber O
dough O
and O
not O
cooked, O
entrecote B-TARGET
hyper O
fat O
I O
had O
to O
eat O
1/4. O

Go O
the O
other O
way! O

They O
won't O
see O
me O
anymore... O

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
lunch O
break, O
sheltered O
from O
the O
sun, O
with O
a O
refreshing O
air O
and O
view B-TARGET
on O
the O
port. O

Simple O
but O
good O
food, B-TARGET
Marco O
welcomes O
you O
very O
well, O
gives O
you O
good O
addresses O
if O
you O
ask. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
pleasant O
place. B-TARGET

We O
ate O
there O
in O
the O
evening, O
its O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
on O
a O
very O
pretty O
place B-TARGET
with O
its O
church. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
the O
starter, O
the O
main O
course O
and O
the O
dessert. O

Just O
a O
pale O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
or O
the O
director B-TARGET
(I O
did O
not O
understand) O
with O
his O
cigar O
it O
will O
recognize O
itself O
(so O
much O
worse), O
and O
it O
speaks O
too O
much O
!!!! O

Honestly, O
the O
restaurant's O
setting B-TARGET
is O
rather O
nice. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
"young" O
and O
professional. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
offers O
a O
wide O
choice O
of O
brasserie O
type O
dishes. O

But O
big O
disappointment... O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
burger I-TARGET
is O
well O
presented, O
but O
the O
slice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
is O
equal O
to O
the O
Macdonald... O
No O
flavor O
and O
interest... O

The O
Roquefort B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
too O
creamy, O
no O
taste... O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
is O
actually O
a O
ganache O
full O
of O
water... O

This O
is O
not O
a O
good O
sign... O

It's O
a O
real O
shame O
considering O
the O
area B-TARGET
and O
the O
setting. B-TARGET

It's O
an O
address O
where O
we O
dine O
regularly. O

Here, O
everything O
is O
professional. O

From O
the O
reception B-TARGET
to O
the O
plate, B-TARGET
including O
the O
rhythm O
of O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
decor B-TARGET
is O
magnificent O
and O
it O
is O
better O
to O
reserve O
a O
table O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
where O
the O
glass B-TARGET
roof I-TARGET
is O
open O
in O
summer. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
up O
to O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
starters B-TARGET
are O
7 O
euros O
and O
copious. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good O
but O
don't O
expect O
any O
big O
surprises. O

They O
master O
the O
typical O
"bistro" O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
meats B-TARGET
are O
excellent, O
especially O
the O
flank B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
with O
shallots. O

Their O
little O
chocolate O
pot B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
dessert O
is O
a O
real O
treat. O

A O
small O
drawback. O

My O
companion O
is O
a O
vegetarian O
and O
they O
currently O
only O
have O
gnocchi O
with O
shellfish O
cream O
to O
offer O
as O
a O
dish. B-TARGET

It O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
mention O
another O
vegetable-based O
sauce O
to O
accompany O
them. O

But O
we O
will O
remain O
regular O
customers O
of O
this O
address B-TARGET
which O
is O
a O
must O
for O
lovers O
of O
typical O
Parisian O
brasseries. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
well O
decorated. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
have O
no O
taste, O
no O
seasoning, O
it O
is O
quite O
coarse O
for O
a O
very O
salty O
note. O

To O
know O
Moroccan O
cuisine O
well, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
like O
a O
tourist O
trap O
that O
puts O
local O
cuisine B-TARGET
to O
shame. O

Moreover, O
we O
took O
bottles O
that O
we O
did O
not O
finish O
at O
the O
table, O
we O
were O
not O
even O
allowed O
to O
bring O
them O
to O
the O
restaurant's O
dance O
hall O
to O
finish O
them. O

This O
dancing B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
in O
spite O
of O
its O
narrowness O
we O
had O
fun O
but O
there O
were O
few O
people O
so O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
the O
pleasure O
is O
always O
there O
the O
evenings O
of O
affluence. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
correct O
and O
polite O
but O
not O
very O
lively. O

I O
didn't O
eat O
well O
and O
I O
advise O
you O
to O
pass O
by. O

What O
a O
disappointment! O

Excessive B-TARGET
waiting, I-TARGET
the O
wine B-TARGET
requested O
is O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
cellar, O
but O
we O
are O
not O
offered O
another! O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
on O
the O
bill, O
a O
very O
expensive O
wine O
is O
counted! O

3 O
dishes O
finally O
arrive, O
then O
a O
blue O
meat B-TARGET
requested O
brought O
well O
cooked. O

A O
long O
time O
later, O
the O
first O
ones O
having O
already O
finished, O
the O
second O
blue O
meat, B-TARGET
cold. O

Unfriendly O
staff, O
not O
very O
available, O
a O
birthday O
meal O
that O
turned O
sour. O

As O
a O
family, O
after O
a O
long O
walk, O
the O
nice O
weather O
attracted O
us O
to O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
are O
correct. O

We O
took O
daily O
dishes. O

It O
was O
good, O
without O
being O
exceptional. O

The O
children O
loved O
the O
homemade O
chocolate B-TARGET
mi-cuit. I-TARGET

You O
should O
expect O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
toilets O
in O
the O
basement O
during O
peak O
hours O
;o) O

If O
you O
pass O
by O
there, O
you O
can O
stop O
for O
the O
setting, B-TARGET
the O
birds O
and O
ducks O
around, O
but O
without O
expecting O
something O
exceptional O
from O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

We O
had O
lunch O
there O
by O
taking O
two O
fomules O
at O
16 O
euros. O

Starter, B-TARGET
main O
course O
and O
dessert O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
Montmartre B-TARGET
with O
a O
correct O
quality, O
I O
find O
that O
not O
bad. O

We O
took O
a O
carafe, O
so O
I O
can't O
give O
any O
judgment O
on O
the O
drinks. O

Ravioles B-TARGET
and O
tartiflette B-TARGET
correct, O
crêpe B-TARGET
suzette I-TARGET
passable. O

Indeed O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
at O
home O
and O
don't O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
customers O
when O
they O
talk. O

After O
that, O
there O
is O
a O
certain O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
room. O

Ordinary O
meal B-TARGET
but O
which O
allows O
to O
eat O
at O
lower O
cost O
and O
in O
the O
heat. O

Count O
12€ O
for O
an O
adult O
menu O
and O
10€ O
for O
a O
child. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
avoid O
the O
tables O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
catch O
death. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
nice. O

We O
are O
a O
little O
cramped O
but O
it O
is O
the O
principle O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
small O
brewery, B-TARGET
decoration B-TARGET
to O
be O
revised O
because O
aging O
but O
family O
and O
friendly. O

Disappointing O
dinner O
from O
all O
points O
of O
view: O
sad O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(only O
4 O
tables O
occupied O
this O
Sunday O
evening), O
cold O
service B-TARGET
(only O
one O
person O
in O
the O
dining O
room, O
often O
absent, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
his O
return O
each O
time O
we O
wanted O
to O
ask O
for O
something), O
disappointing O
dishes: B-TARGET
the O
arborio O
rice O
with B-TARGET
truffles I-TARGET
appearing O
in O
the O
à O
la O
carte O
menu O
available O
on O
the O
restaurant's O
website O
had O
become O
a O
simple O
mushroom O
risotto O
(very O
average O
by O
the O
way), O
for O
the O
same O
price O
(18 O
euros O
as O
an O
appetizer), O
and O
the O
sweetbreads B-TARGET
were O
overcooked, O
dry, O
poorly O
accompanied. O

Wines B-TARGET
by I-TARGET
the O
glass O
were O
disappointing. O

The O
soufflé O
that O
I O
had O
spotted O
on O
the O
website O
menu B-TARGET
was O
no O
longer O
available. O

Addition: O
160 O
euros O
for O
2 O
with O
2 O
glasses O
each O
and O
sharing O
the O
dessert. O

Not O
worth O
it. O

I O
don't O
recommend O
it. O

An O
address O
to O
recommend O
if O
you O
like O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
with O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
taste. O

The O
snails B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
the O
marrow B-TARGET
bone I-TARGET
tasty, O
and O
the O
bourguignon B-TARGET
of O
our O
neighbors O
was O
fragrant... O

Small O
room B-TARGET
but O
much O
less O
noisy O
than O
one O
would O
think, O
the O
old O
stones O
absorb O
the O
noise. O

Smiling O
service, B-TARGET
neither O
too O
slow O
nor O
too O
fast. O

Beginning O
of O
the O
evening O
at O
20 O
hours, O
to O
leave O
at O
22 O
hours O
30. O

A O
really O
good O
evening. O

Well, O
a O
little O
expensive O
but O
it O
is O
not O
an O
everyday O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Imposed O
menus. B-TARGET

Mediocre O
aperitifs. B-TARGET

Ridiculous O
tapas B-TARGET
plates. O

Dish B-TARGET
arrived O
cold, O
meat B-TARGET
poorly O
cooked, O
cold O
potatoes, B-TARGET
raw I-TARGET
zucchini, I-TARGET
hot O
salad, B-TARGET
dish B-TARGET
too O
salty O
overall, O
good O
point O
for O
the O
wine B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
. O

Pungent O
wine. B-TARGET

Apple O
pie B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
calva I-TARGET
without O
calva O
worthy O
of O
a O
school O
canteen. O

Scam O
of O
the O
century, O
the O
plates B-TARGET
are O
not O
very O
well O
supplied, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
mediocre O
and O
the O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
totally O
staggering. O

Frozen O
fries... B-TARGET

Overpriced O
drinks B-TARGET
... O
but O
it's O
the O
same O
all O
over O
the O
place O
... O
uncomfortable O
seats O
but O
a O
blanket O
offered O
... O
a O
natural O
good O
mood O
... O

decent O
food B-TARGET
... O

Choose O
a O
table O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
see O
the O
painters O
of O
Montmartre O
at O
work O

Go O
with O
friends O
or O
family O
... O

You O
will O
regret O
less O
the O
bill O
! O

This O
small O
and O
discreet O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
worth O
the O
detour, O
first O
of O
all O
- O
and O
it O
must O
be O
underlined O
- O
for O
the O
warm O
welcome B-TARGET
that O
the O
owner O
reserves O
to O
his O
customers O
(thanks O
for O
the O
kir O
;), O
but O
also O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
served. O

The O
starters B-TARGET
are O
simple O
but O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
offers O
two O
series O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
allow O
to O
adapt O
to O
all O
budgets. O

For O
our O
part, O
we O
chose O
the O
beef O
tartar. O

The O
seasoning B-TARGET
was O
done O
directly O
in O
the O
kitchen O
and O
was O
particularly O
delicious. O

The O
range O
of O
desserts B-TARGET
is O
humble, O
but O
each O
one O
is O
enhanced O
by O
a O
little O
creative O
touch O
from O
the O
owner, O
which O
enhances O
the O
flavor. O

Without O
hesitation, O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
it O
is O
good O
to O
eat O
with O
a O
friend O
or O
a O
member O
of O
your O
family, O
and O
which O
contrasts O
strongly O
with O
the O
"industrial" O
brasseries O
that O
one O
sometimes O
finds O
in O
Paris. O

Do O
not O
hesitate! O

A O
marvel! O

A O
fine, O
creative O
and O
absolutely O
delicious O
cuisine, B-TARGET
a O
warm O
setting B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
pleasant O
service. B-TARGET

As O
a O
starter, O
we O
had O
haddock B-TARGET
flammekueche I-TARGET
style I-TARGET
(delicious) O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
duck B-TARGET
confis I-TARGET
in O
jelly O
with O
nuts O
and O
pears O
(very O
good). O

For O
the O
main O
course, O
I O
completely O
fell O
for O
the O
cod B-TARGET
risotto I-TARGET
with O
chorizo O
emulsion O
(very O
surprising). O

Finally O
the O
masterpiece: O
the O
vanilla B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
pudding I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
caramel I-TARGET
and O
salted O
butter O
sauce O
(divine). O

The O
citrus B-TARGET
shortbread I-TARGET
tart I-TARGET
was O
also O
perfect O
to O
refresh O
a O
particularly O
copious O
dinner. B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
also O
adorable. O

A O
great O
time, O
we O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
and O
highly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

I O
have O
already O
eaten O
in O
more O
than O
50 O
brasseries O
in O
Paris O
and O
this O
is O
the O
1st O
time O
I O
feel O
obliged O
to O
leave O
a O
review... O

the O
service B-TARGET
was O
close O
to O
absolute O
zero O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
not O
very O
friendly O
but... O
if O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
I O
wouldn't O
have O
come O
here O
to O
give O
a O
review. O

I O
had O
the O
bavette O
with O
fries! O

oh O
my O
god, O
the O
fries B-TARGET
were O
not O
well O
cooked, O
cold O
and O
just O
came O
out O
of O
the O
freezer...the O
flank O
steak B-TARGET
was O
soaked O
in O
oil O
and O
had O
no O
taste... O

I O
think O
I'll O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
the O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
lol, O
and O
I O
taste O
a O
really O
awful O
mousse! O

no O
taste O
at O
all, O
worse O
than O
the O
metro O
one... O
even O
the O
discount O
chocolate O
mousse O
are O
better.... O

i O
really O
wondered O
if O
my O
guys O
were O
aware O
of O
the O
crap O
they O
were O
serving... O
they O
were O
serving.... O

no O
luck, O
i O
was O
sick O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
the O
meal B-TARGET
is O
probably O
for O
something! O

don't O
go O
there O
if O
you O
take O
the O
flank O
steak, O
fries O
and O
a O
mousse! O

I O
will O
not O
take O
the O
risk O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes... O

The O
best O
setting B-TARGET
in O
the O
street O
with O
its O
authentic O
beams O
and O
frameworks, O
spacious O
tables, O
prices O
and O
a O
rare O
quality-price O
ratio O
with O
fresh, O
home-made O
products. B-TARGET

Different O
formulas B-TARGET
at O
12,5€, O
15,80€ O
and O
18,90€ O
which O
include O
starter O
+ O
main O
course O
+ O
dessert! O
As O
much O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
very O
rare O
in O
St. O
Germain O
des O
Près. O

Germain O
des O
Près. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
smiling O
and O
patient. O

A O
real O
favorite. O

I O
went O
several O
times O
during O
my O
Parisian O
escapades, O
to O
dine O
in O
this O
well O
located O
establishment. B-TARGET

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice; O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
dynamic, O
helpful. O

It's O
a O
pleasure O
to O
feel O
that O
because O
it O
becomes O
more O
and O
more O
rare. O

To O
eat O
in O
the O
evening O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
a O
pure O
delight. O

The O
content O
of O
the O
plates B-TARGET
is O
just O
as O
successful: O
copious O
and O
very O
good O
from O
the O
starter O
to O
the O
desserts. O

I O
will O
continue O
to O
spend O
good O
moments O
in O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
during O
my O
next O
trips O
in O
a O
charming O
setting B-TARGET

We O
were O
initially O
attracted O
by O
a O
sunny O
terrace, B-TARGET
in O
the O
peace O
and O
by O
its O
menu B-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices. O

Since O
then O
we O
have O
had O
lunch O
and O
dinner O
there O
several O
times. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good, O
even O
very O
good, O
extremely O
varied O
with O
a O
daily O
menu B-TARGET
of O
fish O
and O
meat O
modified O
daily O
(pea B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
capuchino I-TARGET
not O
to O
be O
missed) O
It O
is O
a O
family O
kitchen B-TARGET
made O
home O
most O
of O
the O
time. O

The O
team B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

We O
are O
served O
without O
waiting O
and O
with O
good O
humor. O

I O
recommend O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
of O
a O
mediocrity O
without O
name! O

We O
waited O
15 O
minutes O
for O
the O
table O
to O
be O
prepared O
and O
40 O
minutes O
after O
ordering O
to O
be O
served O
a O
beef B-TARGET
bourguignon I-TARGET
whose O
quality O
and O
taste O
leave O
much O
to O
be O
desired! O

Almost O
raw O
potatoes B-TARGET
with O
raw O
carrots B-TARGET
and O
a O
tasteless O
and O
unseasoned O
sauce! B-TARGET

I O
think O
we O
have O
never O
been O
so O
much O
laughed O
at! O

No O
communication O
from O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
served O
other O
customers O
who O
arrived O
after O
us O
(starter O
and O
main O
course) O
included! O

A O
scandal! O

I O
really O
almost O
left O
after O
40mn O
of O
waiting O
when O
I O
saw O
the O
plate O
arriving O
because O
I O
clearly O
found O
the O
behavior O
of O
the O
boss B-TARGET
execrable O
and O
disdainful. O

A O
piece O
of O
advice: O
don't O
set O
foot O
there, O
it's O
a O
tourist O
trap O
and O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
and O
money! O

The O
view O
from O
outside O
on O
the O
big B-TARGET
shelf I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
bottles I-TARGET
attracted O
us. O

So O
we O
went O
into O
this O
wine O
bar O
with O
a O
very O
original O
decoration! B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
adorable, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
and O
the O
advices O
to O
choose O
it O
are O
great! O

Ideal O
to O
spend O
an O
apero O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
ham O
to O
nibble. O

We O
were O
less O
seduced O
by O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
we O
found O
a O
little O
expensive O
vs. O
the O
quality O
proposed O
although O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
fresh O
and O
that's O
important. O

In O
a O
quiet O
street, B-TARGET
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
warm, O
the O
room B-TARGET
pleasant O
and O
comfortable. O

With O
family O
or O
friends, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
at O
a O
suitable O
level, O
allowing O
you O
to O
hold O
a O
conversation O
without O
shouting, O
while O
tasting O
excellent O
dishes, B-TARGET
nicely O
presented O
and O
very O
tasty, O
served O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
accompanied O
by O
very O
good O
wines. B-TARGET

To O
be O
repeated! O

I O
am O
well O
aware O
that O
this O
opinion O
will O
not O
change O
anything, O
the O
bar B-TARGET
being O
placed O
in O
such O
a O
way O
as O
to O
always O
be O
able O
to O
attract O
tourists O
but O
well, O
such O
a O
scandalous O
place B-TARGET
deserves O
to O
be O
denounced. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
we O
inherited O
is O
a O
sour O
old O
man O
whose O
rudeness O
reflects O
the O
disgust O
he O
has O
for O
his O
job O
and O
the O
little O
esteem O
he O
probably O
has O
for O
himself. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
unpleasant O
and O
was O
topped O
off O
by O
an O
incomprehensible O
menu B-TARGET
with O
exorbitant O
prices. O

We O
were O
satisfied O
with O
one O
glass O
each, O
which O
were O
not O
even O
clean. O

A O
pure O
scandal. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
already O
not O
very O
well O
located O
I O
think. O

We O
entered, O
and O
there, O
nobody O
to O
welcome O
us... O

A O
TV O
to O
turn O
on, O
but O
we O
waited O
5 O
minutes O
before O
seeing O
someone, O
who O
asked O
us O
to O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
next O
door... O

The B-TARGET
welcome I-TARGET
was O
not O
too O
bad, O
but O
I O
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
be O
able O
to O
discuss O
with O
my O
spouse O
without O
being O
listened O
by O
one O
of O
the O
waitresses... B-TARGET

As O
for O
the O
meal, O
it O
was O
quite O
quick O
to O
be O
served. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
was O
quite O
good, O
but O
everything O
is O
surely O
frozen O
and O
it's O
a O
pity O
to O
have O
had O
my O
dessert O
when O
my O
man O
had O
finished! O

We O
discovered O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
Groupon, O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
it O
without O
this O
offer. O

Clearly O
this O
is O
our O
canteen O
since O
we O
work O
right O
next O
door. O

the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
large O
and O
mostly O
sunny, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
efficient O
and O
fast, O
the O
formula B-TARGET
changes O
every O
day, O
and O
there O
are O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
extra O
charge O
that O
often O
make O
my O
mouth O
water. O

nice O
to O
have O
a O
drink O
after O
work. O

ah O
: O
when O
it's O
a O
bit O
chilly, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
heated O
and O
they O
put O
plaids O
on O
the O
chairs, O
that O
helps O
:) O

One O
of O
the O
few O
restaurants O
in O
the O
area. O

Crowded O
with O
employees O
of O
companies O
in O
the O
area. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
ok O
and O
the O
daily B-TARGET
specials I-TARGET
are O
very O
expensive. O

No O
meat O
on O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

Tiramisu B-TARGET
very O
good O
and O
abundant. O

To O
be O
avoided O
in O
winter O
because O
few O
covers O
inside O
and O
the O
covered O
terrace O
is O
not O
heated O
enough. O

The O
excellent O
reviews O
of O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
were O
confirmed O
at O
the O
table. O

The O
menu-card B-TARGET
offers O
a O
choice O
for O
all O
tastes O
and O
allows O
to O
discover O
well O
presented O
seasonal B-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
renewed O
every O
day O
with O
3 O
starters, O
3 O
main O
courses O
and O
3 O
desserts. O

But O
the O
must-try O
dishes O
are O
obviously O
the O
sea O
bream B-TARGET
tartar, I-TARGET
the O
Cajun B-TARGET
shrimps, I-TARGET
the O
gnocchi B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
agria I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
truffle, I-TARGET
the O
back B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cod I-TARGET
a O
la O
plancha O
(perfectly O
cooked O
and O
served O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
salsify). O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
also O
short O
and O
gives O
pride O
of O
place O
to O
the O
Côtes O
du O
Rhône O
and O
Languedoc O
Roussillon, O
highlighting O
affordable O
vintages, B-TARGET
some O
of O
which O
come O
from O
recognized O
producers. O

Attentive O
and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

The O
sommelier B-TARGET
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
change O
a O
bottle O
with O
a O
defect. O

Chic O
bistro O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

A O
little O
noisy O
but O
as O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
seems O
to O
be O
full O
every O
night O
... O

The O
only O
thing O
missing O
was O
the O
famous O
box O
of O
sweets O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal! O

A O
good O
address B-TARGET
close O
to O
the O
Etoile. B-TARGET

Another O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
is O
losing O
quality O
little O
by O
little. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
great, O
I'm O
a O
fan, O
even O
if O
I O
prefer O
the O
recuperation O
or O
industrial O
type O
decoration, O
I O
like O
this O
romantic O
type O
decoration. O

Inside B-TARGET
we O
are O
quiet O
and O
if O
we O
like O
to O
see O
people O
passing O
by O
we O
can O
go O
to O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
in O
summer O
where O
I O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
with O
my O
friends O
watching O
people O
passing O
by. O

Once O
again O
the O
problem, O
as O
in O
many O
restaurants, O
lies O
in O
the O
food B-TARGET
which O
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
level O
of O
the O
address, O
nor O
the O
effort O
made O
to O
decorate B-TARGET
it. O

A O
few O
years O
ago, O
the O
heart-shaped O
burger B-TARGET
was O
a O
must O
have, O
today O
it O
has O
become O
common, O
I O
don't O
even O
finish O
it O
anymore. O

I O
loved O
the O
decor... B-TARGET

I O
enjoyed O
the O
history B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
place. O

We O
had O
oysters, O
pink O
shrimps O
and O
lobster O
as O
starter, O
the O
products B-TARGET
were O
of O
good O
quality. O

The O
shrimps B-TARGET
were O
firm O
and O
excellent. O

The O
lobster B-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
small, O
probably O
Canadian. O

Then, O
the O
bouillabaisse O
in O
2 O
services... O

The O
soup B-TARGET
first O
of O
all O
very O
good, O
generous O
in O
croutons... O

The O
continuation, O
the O
very O
fine O
fish, B-TARGET
one O
of O
the O
fish O
was O
filled O
of O
stop, O
it O
is O
a O
pity O
but O
good... O

This O
does O
not O
detract O
from O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
bouillabaisse... B-TARGET

For O
dessert, O
a O
pancake O
and O
a O
grand O
marnier O
soufflé. O

Nice O
success O
on O
the O
soufflé, B-TARGET
attention O
impressive O
size O
! O
Melts O
well O
in O
the O
mouth, O
not O
heavy O
at O
all O
! O

It O
was O
a O
very O
good O
lunch. B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
extremely O
well O
located O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Champs O
Elysees! O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
very O
inventive O
and O
changes O
from O
the O
ordinary O
decoration. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
correct O
for O
the O
price. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
busy O
with O
the O
different O
tables O
so O
don't O
expect O
any O
particular O
attention O
towards O
you! O

Restaurant B-TARGET
to O
try O
(at O
least O
once) O
to O
get O
an O
idea. O

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
with O
a O
view B-TARGET
on O
the O
Eiffel O
Tower O
for O
sure O
but O
and O
there O
is O
really O
a O
but O
beyond O
the O
prohibitive O
prices O
for O
a O
very O
average O
dinner B-TARGET
in O
quality O
and O
very O
pretentious O
in O
presentation... O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
deplorable, O
you O
have O
to O
beg O
them O
to O
take O
your O
order, O
they O
forget O
to O
bring O
the O
carafe O
of O
water, O
they O
ignore O
our O
raised O
hands O
and O
take O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
bill O

For O
gogos O
tourists O
and O
still O

It's O
been O
5 O
years O
since O
we O
came O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant O
which O
offers O
a O
superb O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
a O
nice O
area B-TARGET
of O
Paris... O

But O
my O
god O
what O
a O
disaster O
in O
terms O
of O
service B-TARGET
and O
cuisine. B-TARGET

When O
we O
arrived, O
3 O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
waitresses B-TARGET
passed O
us O
before O
we O
were O
even O
addressed. O

The O
manager's B-TARGET
arrival O
was O
a O
caricature O
with O
her O
crumpled O
table O
plan O
trying O
to O
place O
us O
inside O
despite O
our O
express O
request O
for O
the O
terrace. O

Finally O
we O
won. O

Sitting O
on O
uncomfortable O
garden O
chairs O
we O
waited O
for O
the O
aperitif O
which O
arrived O
very O
quickly O
the O
only O
problem O
was O
the O
difference O
between O
our O
two O
glasses B-TARGET
for O
the O
same O
alcohol O
1/4 O
of O
different O
quantity. O

I O
pass O
you O
the O
meal O
whose O
products B-TARGET
are O
any. O

Even O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
of O
Pierre O
Herme O
that O
I O
would O
invite O
to O
not O
authorize O
the O
distribution O
in O
this O
establishment O
were O
served. O

Too O
fresh. O

To O
accompany O
it O
I O
had O
asked O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine. O

Not O
having O
arrived O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
bill O
I O
point O
out O
that O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
bringing O
it O
to O
me. O

Well, O
you O
won't O
believe O
it, O
they O
brought O
it O
to O
me O
with O
the O
bill, O
telling O
me O
that O
it O
was O
already O
served. O

What O
he O
forgot O
to O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
also O
already O
counted O
in O
the O
bill. O

In O
short, O
I O
don't O
know O
where O
the O
former O
owners O
went, O
but O
someone O
has O
to O
take O
over O
this O
establishment. B-TARGET

In O
the O
meantime, O
there O
is O
only O
one O
thing O
to O
do: O
don't O
go O
there. O

Oh O
yes, O
I O
forgot, O
don't O
look O
at O
the O
menu B-TARGET
in O
the O
window, O
you'll O
see O
at O
least O
2 O
dead O
flies O
crushed O
there. O
I O
don't O
dare O
put O
a O
foot O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

For O
the O
flies O
I O
have O
the O
photo. O

But O
I O
do O
not O
publish O
it O
for O
the O
sensitive O
souls O

A O
table B-TARGET
that O
holds O
up O
in O
a O
neighborhood O
where O
the O
tables O
change O
very O
quickly? O

Sophisticated O
but O
not O
too O
much, O
crowded O
but O
not O
noisy O
at O
all, O
at O
the O
table O
or O
the O
counter. O

Very O
nice O
menu B-TARGET
at O
35 O
euros O
for O
lunch O
which O
changes O
all O
the O
time. O

A O
la O
carte, B-TARGET
more O
expensive, O
the O
sole B-TARGET
meunière I-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
delight O
(49 O
euros O
all O
the O
same) O
and O
everyone O
knows O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
succeed. O

The O
veal B-TARGET
chop O
too. O

Wine B-TARGET
by I-TARGET
the O
glass O
(fortunately!). O

Exquisite O
gourmet B-TARGET
coffee. I-TARGET

In O
any O
case O
regular O
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting B-TARGET
just O
a O
step O
from O
the O
Invalides. O

What O
a O
pleasure O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
welcome, B-TARGET
this O
big O
smile, O
this O
kiss, O
the O
whole O
very O
natural, O
we O
are O
not O
used O
to O
this O
friendly O
side O
anymore, O
especially O
in O
Paris! O

And O
the O
setting B-TARGET
!!! O
And O
the O
cooking B-TARGET
!!! O
We O
come O
also O
and O
especially O
for O
that O
and O
our O
last O
lunch B-TARGET
was, O
as O
always, O
extra: O
Poached B-TARGET
turbot I-TARGET
with O
rhubarb, O
creamy O
sauce B-TARGET
with O
parsnip O
puree, O
floating B-TARGET
island I-TARGET
and O
praline B-TARGET
pie O
...all O
washed O
down O
with O
an O
excellent O
Beaujolais B-TARGET
...what O
happiness O
and O
that's O
how O
all O
the O
customers O
become O
regulars, O
or O
rather O
friends O

Sunny O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
sunday, O
nice O
decor, B-TARGET
it O
was O
looking O
good.... O

We O
order O
two O
pools B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
champagne I-TARGET
which O
are O
served O
to O
us O
after O
20 O
min... O
and O
without O
ice! O

When O
we O
ask O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
sour O
as O
a O
pickle O
macerated O
in O
vinegar O
for O
54 O
years O
if O
our O
order O
was O
well O
taken O
he O
literally O
attacks O
us O
by O
telling O
us O
that O
champagne O
is O
being O
sought O
(obviously O
directly O
in O
Reims) O

In O
short, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
don't O
even O
bother O
to O
speak O
in O
English O
to O
the O
poor O
tourists O
stranded O
here, O
the O
siliconned, O
botoxed O
boss, B-TARGET
to O
the O
point O
of O
having O
a O
frozen O
face O
(that O
must O
be O
the O
reason O
for O
her O
cruel O
absence O
of O
smile) O
struts O
around O
on O
the O
terrace O
but O
doesn't O
make O
the O
orders O
go O
any O
faster... O

In O
short, O
run O
away O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
waste O
your O
day O
surrounded O
by O
arrogant O
people! O

Superb O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
welcoming, O
unfortunately O
they O
don't O
know O
how O
to O
describe O
the O
dishes, O
the O
original O
names O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
incomprehensible. O

Once O
served O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
to O
feel O
sick, O
my O
flank O
steak B-TARGET
was O
drowned O
in O
an O
absurd O
amount O
of O
tasteless O
blue B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
as O
for O
my O
friend's O
salad B-TARGET
it O
was O
full O
of O
oil, O
grease O
and O
fat. O

For O
Info O
we O
both O
got O
sick O
in O
the O
night. O

To O
flee!!! O

It's O
a O
very, O
very O
nice O
address B-TARGET
... O
the O
cooking B-TARGET
is O
remarkable O
because O
the O
cooking O
is O
perfect, O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
rather O
seasonal, O
everything O
is O
home-made. O

There O
is O
a O
card O
and O
slates O
for O
the O
formulas. O

It O
is O
a O
mix O
of O
creative O
proposals O
but O
also O
great O
classics. O

The O
plate B-TARGET
is O
perfect O
from O
the O
starter O
to O
the O
dessert, O
which O
is O
not O
so O
frequent. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
focused O
but O
very O
good, O
in O
white O
as O
in O
red. O

We O
are O
well O
in O
a O
logic O
of O
selection O
and O
quality. O

They O
are O
not O
first O
prices O
but O
we O
can O
say O
that O
the O
quality-price B-TARGET
ratio I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
excellent. I-TARGET

The O
reception B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
are O
both O
professional O
but O
relaxed, O
there O
is O
what O
it O
takes O
to O
feel O
good O
but O
also O
to O
be O
very O
well O
received O
and O
to O
come O
back! O

It O
is O
to O
conclude O
a O
very O
beautiful O
address, B-TARGET
a O
rare O
alliance O
of O
tradition O
and O
modernity, O
of O
beautiful O
cooking B-TARGET
but O
which O
remains O
readable, O
pleasant, O
sophisticated O
without O
too O
much. O

No O
wonder O
it O
is O
often O
recommended O
by O
food O
critics. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
ideally O
placed O
for O
business O
meals. O

However, O
it O
is O
absolutely O
not O
worth O
the O
detour, O
except O
to O
see O
and O
be O
seen. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
are O
overpriced O
(about O
20 O
euros O
for O
4 O
steams B-TARGET
... O
good O
but O
that's O
a O
lot O
for O
one O
steam) O
and O
are O
not O
of O
exceptional O
quality. O

If O
you O
want O
two O
side O
dishes, B-TARGET
it O
is O
even O
counted O
as O
an O
extra! O

As O
for O
the O
service, B-TARGET
it O
is O
really O
to O
be O
reviewed. O

Order O
taking O
and O
arrival O
of O
the O
starter O
are O
endless... O
and O
then O
the O
dishes O
do O
not O
arrive O
together O
and O
half O
of O
the O
side O
dishes O
are O
missing. O

In O
short O
to O
avoid!!! O

Menu B-TARGET
a O
bit O
complicated O
between O
Bo O
Boun's, O
salads O
and O
the O
rest. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
have O
a O
good O
appetite O
because O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
copious O
and O
good. O

And O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
pleasant! O

It's O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
comfortable, O
we O
are O
a O
bit O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
and O
if O
you O
are O
corpulent, O
prefer O
the O
terrace. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
often O
overwhelmed O
but O
it O
is O
the O
key O
to O
success O
and O
fame. O

Great O
menu, O
original O
and O
surprising O
flavors, O
very O
pleasant O
setting.... B-TARGET
too O
bad O
that O
the O
general O
impression O
is O
served O
by O
a O
haughty O
and O
unpleasant O
service! B-TARGET

By O
trying O
too O
hard O
to O
escape O
the O
codes O
of O
the O
gastronomic O
restaurant O
(and O
in O
particular O
the O
overzealousness O
which O
can O
sometimes O
characterize O
the O
service), B-TARGET
the O
Chateaubriand O
goes O
too O
far O
in O
my O
opinion! O

Of O
course O
it O
is O
an O
honor O
to O
be O
able O
to O
taste O
the O
inventive O
cuisine B-TARGET
of O
a O
chef O
like O
Inaki O
Aizpitarte... O
but O
whatever O
the O
reputation O
of O
the O
establishment O
and O
its O
success, O
I O
think O
that O
customers O
have O
the O
right O
to O
expect O
to O
be O
served O
by O
people O
who O
are O
at O
least O
friendly O
(if O
only O
because O
they O
pay)! O

I O
was O
sent O
back O
to O
my O
goal O
for O
having O
had O
the O
misfortune O
to O
ask O
about O
the O
composition O
of O
a O
dessert O
that O
was O
not O
presented O
to O
us O
(in O
this O
case O
the O
tocino O
del O
cielo, O
a O
classic O
of O
the O
house O
... O
we O
should O
have O
known O
that's O
why?). O

And O
the O
person O
who O
accompanied O
me, O
from O
Auvergne, O
allowed O
herself O
a O
remark O
with O
a O
big O
smile O
about O
the O
thickness O
of O
the O
slice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
St-Nectaire I-TARGET
that O
was O
served O
(less O
than O
2mm) O
to O
hear O
herself O
answer O
with O
a O
dry O
and O
cold O
"Ah O
well...". O

In O
short, O
it's O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
success O
of O
the O
establishment O
seems O
to O
have O
gone O
to O
the O
head O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
who O
have O
tarnished, O
even O
spoiled O
what O
could O
have O
been O
a O
very O
good O
moment... O

ps: O
top O
sommelier B-TARGET
on O
the O
other O
hand! O

Complicated O
menu B-TARGET
to O
decipher. O

Dishes B-TARGET
very O
average. O

The O
"homemade" O
is O
in O
reality O
a O
defrosted O
homemade. O

No O
flexibility O
in O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

For O
example, O
if O
you O
ask O
for O
fries O
instead O
of O
the O
planned O
filling, O
you'll O
get O
the O
planned O
filling O
and O
an O
extra B-TARGET
fries I-TARGET
(frozen) O
at O
5 O
euros. O

In O
short, O
nice O
setting, B-TARGET
pleasant O
staff, B-TARGET
substantial O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
but O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
menu B-TARGET
to O
be O
reviewed O
in O
depth. O

Arrived O
around O
12:50 O
in O
a O
crowded O
room, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
large O
table O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
room. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
noisy O
but O
relatively O
pleasant. O

After O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting, B-TARGET
a O
waiter O
arrives. O

He O
takes O
the O
order O
in O
an O
excited O
tone O
while O
turning O
around O
to O
give O
orders O
to O
the O
other O
waiters. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
honest, O
I O
chose O
a O
hot O
goat O
cheese O
sandwich, O
my O
husband O
the O
13 O
euros O
menu. O

Honest O
without O
more. O

In O
short, O
a O
decent O
address, B-TARGET
if O
one O
accepts O
to O
be O
treated O
as O
a O
simple O
bill O
payer... O

We O
arrived O
in O
a O
nearly O
empty O
room B-TARGET
on O
a O
Friday O
evening, O
despite O
a O
friend's O
recommendation O
of O
this O
restaurant O
as O
a O
good O
gastro O
address O
at O
a O
nice O
price... O

First O
table O
where O
we O
are O
installed, O
the O
bulb O
above O
is O
burnt O
out, O
half O
darkness O
and O
the O
candles O
on O
the O
side O
seem O
to O
be O
covered O
with O
dust... O

Just O
like O
the O
horrible O
curtains B-TARGET
which O
hang O
above O
our O
heads. O

We O
look O
around O
us O
and O
we O
realize O
that O
it O
is O
in O
fact O
a O
prefabricated O
backyard O
redone O
with O
a O
dubious O
taste, O
like O
the O
photos O
of O
vintage O
prostitutes O
that O
cover O
the O
walls O
in O
shaky O
frames. O

That O
was O
for O
the O
frame... O

On O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
side, O
a O
complete O
lack O
of O
surprise, O
discovery O
or O
audacity... O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
ridiculous, O
three O
bites O
of O
veal B-TARGET
tab O
(25 O
year O
old O
veal O
no O
doubt, O
so O
red O
is O
the O
meat) O
and O
a O
thin O
slice O
of O
gratin B-TARGET
dauphinois, I-TARGET
all O
bathed O
in O
a O
tasteless O
sauce B-TARGET
that O
actually O
seemed O
to O
be... O
water. O

The O
tuna B-TARGET
is O
so O
raw O
that O
it O
is O
better O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Japanese, O
but O
my O
companion O
likes O
it, O
the O
tuna... O

We O
would O
like O
to O
stop O
the O
costs, O
but O
there O
was O
the O
dessert: O
the O
pear O
Belle O
Hélène O
"revisited", O
where O
an O
ice B-TARGET
cream O
turns O
into O
cream O
in O
a O
pool O
of O
chocolate O
where O
pieces O
of O
fruit O
are O
floating. O

Me, O
who O
never O
writes O
an O
opinion, O
I O
think O
tonight O
that O
it O
was O
perhaps O
an O
error O
of O
taste O
on O
my O
part... O

Yes, O
that O
must O
be O
it, O
tonight O
I O
lost O
the O
taste, O
the O
taste O
to O
spend O
100€ O
in O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
without O
taste O
nor O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

We O
were O
in O
this O
evening O
of O
March O
between O
friends O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
birthday O
of O
one O
of O
them. O

We O
arrived O
in O
this O
pub O
restaurant O
for O
dinner. O

But O
as O
we O
were O
too O
many O
(13 O
people), O
we O
were O
installed O
upstairs O
(making O
sure O
we O
were O
told O
that O
the O
first O
floor O
was O
for O
regulars O
and O
soccer O
fans O
and O
that O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
eat O
we O
had O
to O
go O
back O
downstairs O
to O
order) O
in O
an O
Iounge B-TARGET
space I-TARGET
barely O
lit O
to O
read O
the O
menu O
(we O
had O
to O
use O
the O
lights O
on O
our O
smartphones). O

After O
making O
the O
staff B-TARGET
understand O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
line O
up O
a O
table O
next O
to O
another, O
we O
went O
back O
downstairs. O

Here O
begins O
the O
dinner O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
dish. O

In O
the O
part O
concerning O
the O
burgers B-TARGET
it O
was O
written O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
order O
the O
burger O
without O
the O
bread O
(interest?). O

When O
I O
asked O
a O
waitress O
if O
the O
fact O
of O
taking O
this O
option O
allowed O
a O
discount O
on O
the O
price O
(already O
expensive O
enough O
for O
the O
quality), O
the O
person B-TARGET
in O
charge O
arrived O
by O
saying O
that O
the O
price O
did O
not O
change O
(after O
that O
comes O
an O
explanation O
on O
the O
margin O
that O
the O
restaurant O
realized O
then), O
and O
retorted O
later O
"we O
are O
a O
restaurant O
so O
our O
goal O
is O
to O
make O
a O
margin" O
(an O
expert O
in O
customer O
relations O
that O
one). O

To O
sum O
up O
(because O
it's O
a O
long O
time O
to O
say O
it), O
we O
spent O
an O
evening O
a O
bit O
tarnished O
by O
the O
image O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
(whose O
condition O
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired), O
a O
table O
service B-TARGET
worthy O
of O
a O
teenager's O
canteen, O
and O
no O
little O
word O
of O
apology O
or O
discount O
whatsoever O
(when O
you O
have O
to O
make O
a O
profit O
by O
any O
means...) O
to O
leave O
with O
a O
smile O
(it O
wasn't O
won). O

Having O
been O
tested O
by O
members O
of O
the O
party O
beforehand, O
we O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time O
for O
some O
and O
the O
last O
time O
for O
everyone O
that O
we O
came O
to O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

To O
think O
that O
this O
brewery O
is O
always O
welcoming O
groups O
of O
tourists... O

What O
a O
shame O
for O
the O
French O
gastronomy! O

That O
day O
I O
wanted O
a O
beef O
tartare. O

I O
have O
family O
who O
dine O
at O
this O
place O
so O
I O
join O
them. O

The O
menu O
was O
a O
steak O
tartare O
with O
fries, O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
sole O
with O
puree. O

We O
will O
make O
simple,. O

ALL O
THE O
MEATS B-TARGET
ARE O
TASTELESS O
AND O
DRY! O

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
certainly O
homemade, O
but O
they O
are O
made O
hours O
in O
advance O
and O
are O
mollified. O

Purity B-TARGET
less O
good O
than O
in O
the O
canteen. O

Run O
away! O

We O
must O
not O
give O
our O
money O
to O
this O
scam. O

I O
can't O
wait O
for O
them O
to O
close O
down! O

Menu O
of O
the O
day O

- O
a O
starter O
of O
smoked B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
on O
celery O
excellent O

- O
veal B-TARGET
sauté I-TARGET
with O
tagliatelle O
very O
good O

Wine B-TARGET
a O
little O
expensive O

Two O
small O
remarks O

- O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
overheated O
which O
is O
really O
unpleasant O

- O
the O
water B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
caraffe O
is O
not O
fresh O
(to O
be O
linked O
with O
the O
previous O
point O
???) O

Very O
competitive O
for O
the O
area O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
what O
we O
have O
in O
our O
plate. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
very O
fast, O
we O
don't O
have O
time O
to O
finish O
a O
dish O
that O
we O
are O
asked O
if O
we O
want O
to O
finish. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
a O
hurry O
it O
is O
the O
ideal O
place! B-TARGET

But O
what O
bothered O
me O
was O
the O
following: O
only O
two O
minutes O
after O
ordering, O
we O
were O
already O
served, O
the O
breaded O
cutlets B-TARGET
would O
they O
be O
all O
made O
in O
advance O
and O
then O
reheated? O

The O
prices O
of O
the O
drinks B-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
very O
high O
(4,5 O
euros O
for O
a O
can B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
coke I-TARGET
..). O

In O
short, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
extraordinary, O
maybe O
even O
prepared O
long O
in O
advance? O

I O
will O
not O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there! O

Very O
Parisian O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
very O
m'as O
tu O
vu! O

Waitress B-TARGET
not O
smiling O
and O
not O
very O
welcoming. O

Very O
average O
cooking, B-TARGET
chicken B-TARGET
pancake I-TARGET
version O
very O
dry O
with O
a O
handful O
of O
beans O
and O
all O
this O
for O
an O
exorbitant O
price! O

The O
club B-TARGET
sandwich I-TARGET
is O
nothing O
special O
and O
the O
Vietnamese B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
very O
dry O
without O
any O
sauce. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
bit O
overloaded O
but O
it O
makes O
the O
charm O
of O
the O
place. O

I O
went O
there O
by O
chance O
with O
some O
friends O
one O
evening O
for O
an O
aperitif O
and O
I O
came O
back O
for O
lunch O
because O
I O
liked O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
formula I-TARGET
at O
15 O
€. O

You O
won't O
find O
the O
pseudo O
tapas O
that O
you O
can O
find O
on O
all O
the O
terraces O
but O
only O
the O
real O
Spanish B-TARGET
recipes: I-TARGET
squid O
rabas, O
croquetas O
de O
jamon O
y O
queso, O
tomato O
bread, O
bacalao O
croquetas, O
tortilla, O
serrano, O
piquillos, O
squid O
in O
ink, O
artichokes O
with O
ham... O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
simply O
delicious O
sangria! B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
just O
like O
the O
rest: O
Catalan O
cream, O
Basque O
cake, O
sheep O
cheese O
and O
black O
cherry O
jam... O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
don't O
all O
speak O
French O
very O
well O
but O
they O
are O
very O
nice O
(and O
their O
Spanish O
accent O
reinforces O
the O
authenticity O
of O
the O
place). B-TARGET

Only O
reproach: O
a O
lot O
of O
tables O
and O
not O
much O
space, O
so O
we O
are O
quickly O
cramped. O

But O
I O
will O
go O
back O
with O
my O
eyes O
closed! O

15€ O
for O
a O
salad B-TARGET
composed I-TARGET
with O
two O
ingredients: O
green O
salad O
and O
2 O
slices O
of O
smoked O
salmon. O

One O
leaves O
with O
the O
hunger O
and O
the O
bad O
impression O
to O
have O
been O
plucked, O
with O
the O
manner O
(the O
salmon O
is O
laid O
out O
so O
that O
it O
hides O
the O
forest O
of O
green O
salad O
which O
gives O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
consistent O
dish). O

If O
you O
are O
hungry, O
run O
away! O

We O
were O
invited O
yesterday O
by O
some O
friends O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
party. O

Hesitant O
at O
the O
beginning O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
place, B-TARGET
a O
good O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
good O
quality O
tapas B-TARGET
gobbled O
up, O
we O
finally O
spent O
an O
excellent O
evening O
with O
our O
friends. O

The O
owner O
seems O
RUSTY O
at O
the O
beginning, O
but O
he O
plays O
a O
"game" O
and O
is O
super O
considerate O
with O
his O
customers! O

A O
simple O
place B-TARGET
to O
spend O
a O
pleasant O
evening! O

We O
had O
booked O
for O
our O
son's O
20th O
birthday O
(April), O
what O
a O
disappointment, O
birthday O
partly O
ruined! O

We O
had O
negotiated O
the O
menu O
with O
the O
manager O
and O
we O
were O
confident O
since O
we O
had O
celebrated O
the O
70th O
birthday O
of O
my O
father-in-law O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
we O
were O
completely O
satisfied. O

Of O
course O
we O
didn't O
have O
a O
big O
budget, O
15€ O
per O
person, O
starter, O
main O
course, O
cake. O

But O
no O
quality O
in O
the O
plate, B-TARGET
no O
presentation, O
we O
thought O
we O
were O
having O
a O
meal O
at O
home. O

Moreover, O
among O
our O
plates, B-TARGET
we O
had O
a O
panel O
of O
pieces O
of O
meat O
from O
the O
smallest O
to O
the O
biggest! O

The O
salmon B-TARGET
was O
raw, O
we O
pointed O
it O
out, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
took O
the O
3 O
plates O
concerned, O
came O
back O
and O
asked O
us O
whose O
plates O
it O
was? O

Moreover, O
annealed O
in O
the O
microwave!!! O
with O
green B-TARGET
beans I-TARGET
steamed, O
not O
returned, O
without O
sauce, O
in O
short O
lamentable! O

The O
cake: O
a O
strawberry, B-TARGET
we O
had O
sought O
the O
strawberries O
and O
sickening O
too O
much O
cream. O

Fortunately O
the O
non-alcoholic B-TARGET
cocktails I-TARGET
and O
coffees B-TARGET
were O
good O
and O
offered, O
but O
we O
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
pay O
for O
them O
and O
have O
something O
better O
on O
the O
plate. B-TARGET
A O
minimum O
of O
presentation, O
it's O
a O
small O
thing O
that O
can O
make O
the O
difference O
to O
the O
eye! O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
smiling, O
just O
a O
little O
problem O
with O
the O
taking O
of O
the O
3 O
plates O
to O
cook O
the O
salmon O
again O
but O
otherwise O
nothing O
to O
reproach O
her. O

We O
informed O
the O
manager O
of O
the O
room, O
he O
was O
very O
embarrassed O
and O
told O
us O
that O
he O
would O
have O
it O
fixed. O

We O
learned O
afterwards, O
change O
of O
owner O
and O
cook O
since O
our O
last O
visit. O

Located O
between O
the O
Arena O
and O
the O
square O
courtyard, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
always O
full. O

Very O
curious O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
sensational, O
I O
burned O
my O
palate O
with O
egg O
rolls. O

The O
Cantonese B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
was O
dry O
and O
I O
waited O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
mns O
for O
2 O
unfortunate O
scoops O
of O
ice O
cream. O

Small O
kitchen B-TARGET
of O
low O
quality O
and O
not O
home O
made. O

We O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
better O
meal B-TARGET
with O
less O
speed O
and O
more O
taste. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
suggests O
that O
everything O
will O
be O
fine O
but O
nothing O
happens. O

We O
came O
with O
a O
Groupon. O

We O
were O
very O
well O
received. O

Fast O
and O
quality O
service. B-TARGET

Freshness O
of O

... O
attention O
: O
book O
! O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
tourist O
center. O

A O
little O
bit O
old. O

Classic O
food B-TARGET
of O
Menton. O

To O
go O
there O
from O
time O
to O
time. O

Relatively O
expensive O
for O
the O
quality/price. O

Superb O
setting B-TARGET
if O
you O
eat O
outside. O

Welcome B-TARGET
of O
the O
most O
sterile, O
almost O
the O
impression O
to O
disturb. O

We O
order O
2 O
pizzas, B-TARGET
of O
correct O
aspect O
but O
bathed O
in O
oil, O
ok O
we O
are O
in O
the O
south O
thus O
we O
pass O
in O
addition. O

After O
tasting O
it O
is O
the O
drama, O
a O
stone O
in O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
of O
my O
friend. O

I O
call O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
to O
complain, O
no O
excuse, O
for O
her O
it's O
normal O
because O
it's O
fresh O
mushroom O
and O
says O
that O
next O
time O
they O
will O
make O
frozen O
... O

After O
we O
got O
carried O
away O
and O
demanded O
an O
apology, O
she O
ended O
up O
shyly O
apologizing O
and O
offering O
us O
a O
coffee... O

To O
be O
avoided O

Obviously, O
we O
disturb O
the O
waitress. B-TARGET

The O
mojito B-TARGET
is O
abominable, O
lukewarm, O
much O
too O
sweet, O
lemon O
thrown O
as O
is O
in O
the O
glass... O

We O
didn't O
have O
the O
pleasure O
to O
taste O
the O
food, O
too O
bad! O

Seasonal O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
small O
zucchinis B-TARGET
of O
country O
excellent O
accompanied O
by O
a O
duck B-TARGET
breast O
cooked O
to O
perfection. O

In O
his O
open O
kitchen, O
you O
can O
feel O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
owner O
and O
on O
the O
terrace, O
despite O
the O
crowds, O
you O
can O
appreciate O
the O
kindness O
and O
advice O
of O
his O
wife O
and O
son. O

To O
recommend O
to O
the O
amateurs O
of O
good O
meat B-TARGET
and O
products O
of O
the O
soil. O

Think O
of O
booking. O

Cathy O
and O
Laurent. O

In O
August O
2014, O
decided O
to O
go O
and O
eat O
pizzas, O
salads O
and O
others O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
disappointed O
by O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Waiter B-TARGET
overwhelmed O
while O
the O
terrace O
was O
not O
filled. O

Meals O
arrived O
in O
dribs O
and O
drabs, O
so O
my O
son O
and O
grandson O
got O
their O
pizzas O
10 O
minutes O
after O
us. O

Very O
disappointed O
by O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
lunch O
with O
spa O
package. O

A O
little O
away O
from O
the O
city O
center, O
serene. O

I O
will O
not O
repeat O
everything O
that O
was O
said O
because O
it O
is O
all O
true!!! O

Extremely O
expensive O
price, O
money O
factory. O

My O
Experience O
was O
around O
a O
question O
to O
one O
of O
the O
waiters O
to O
get O
a O
carafe O
of O
water O
after O
having O
consumed O
more O
than O
50 O
euros. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
with O
long O
hair, O
brown, O
in O
his O
thirties, O
answered O
me O
in O
a O
very O
contemptuous O
tone O
that O
in O
Chamonix O
water O
is O
not O
free. O

Claiming O
that O
he O
had O
to O
give O
in O
to O
my O
request O
according O
to O
the O
legislation O
in O
force O
in O
our O
country, O
he O
openly O
ignored O
me, O
and O
just O
proposed O
to O
consult O
the O
management. O

Shameful. O

A O
perfect O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
table, B-TARGET
considering O
the O
small O
surface O
of O
the O
place, B-TARGET
all O
is O
well. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
go O
there, O
to O
conclude O
the O
extraordinary O
mountain O
place B-TARGET
at O
3842 O
m. O

Congratulations O
again O
to O
the O
chef O
and O
his O
team. B-TARGET

But O
nothing O
more. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
nice O
but O
not O
very O
available. O

We O
took O
a O
hot O
stone O
for O
two. O

The O
meats B-TARGET
were O
good O
but O
a O
little O
short O
on O
quantity O
for O
my O
taste. O

The O
homemade O
mayonnaise B-TARGET
sauces I-TARGET
were O
good O
but O
not O
much O
more, O
they O
lacked O
a O
bit O
of O
flavor. O

The O
tartiflette B-TARGET
was O
ok. O

In O
short, O
the O
meal B-TARGET
was O
not O
bad O
but O
I O
was O
not O
thrilled. O

Divine! O
Nice O
place, O
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
very O
nice O
boss B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
bottle B-TARGET
of O
wine O
with O
it! O

To O
recommend O
1000 O
times! O

A O
very O
good O
time O
spent O
in O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

My O
wife O
and O
I O
had O
a O
great O
time. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
chose O
were O
very O
copious. O

Nothing O
famous O
to O
report O
for O
two O
months O
!!! O

It O
is O
as O
if O
the O
noble O
products B-TARGET
had O
disappeared. O

There O
is O
not O
only O
the O
skirt O
steak O
in O
the O
life O

From O
the O
reception B-TARGET
to O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
down-market, O
fortunately O
the O
flatterer B-TARGET
is O
there O
to O
trap O
the O
tourists O
who O
pass O
by. O

TO O
AVOID!!! O

very O
good O
product B-TARGET
hamburger B-TARGET
and O
fries B-TARGET
house O
a O
regal O
the O
owner B-TARGET
super O
cool O
and O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O

nice O
location B-TARGET
for O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
what O
a O
disappointment O
.... O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
doesn't O
speak O
and O
who O
serves O
you O
without O
announcing O
anything O
on O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
side O
nothing O
better O
very O
little O
garnished O
plates B-TARGET
and O
quality O
bof O
basic O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cold O
cuts O
andouillette B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
potato I-TARGET
dish O
that O
I O
strongly O
advise O
against O
..... O
in O
short O
pass O
your O
way O

I O
pass O
on O
the O
time, O
1h30 O
for O
a O
simple O
meal. O

A O
very O
simple O
menu B-TARGET
but O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
completely O
lost. O

Mistakes O
in O
taking O
the O
order O
and O
a O
boss B-TARGET
who O
refuses O
to O
change O
the O
dishes O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
she O
won't O
throw O
away O
the O
plate O
and O
that O
she O
did O
it O
with O
love. O

Apparently O
there O
is O
no O
question O
of O
losing O
money O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
she O
invents O
excuses O
to O
make O
the O
pill O
go O
away.The O
whole O
room O
is O
of O
my O
opinion O
and O
angry. O

Some O
English O
people O
on O
the O
terrace O
pay O
before O
the O
end O
and O
leave. O

I O
pass O
on O
to O
you O
the O
"spats" O
with O
the O
owner B-TARGET
to O
make O
her O
understand O
that O
her O
reaction O
is O
intolerable O
and O
not O
commercial. O

On O
a O
children's O
menu O
that O
was O
never O
asked O
for, O
she O
had O
the O
nerve O
to O
tell O
me O
when O
I O
was O
paying O
that O
she O
was O
offering O
me O
a O
second O
scoop O
of O
ice O
cream O
when O
in O
the O
children's O
menu O
the O
ice O
cream O
had O
only O
one O
scoop....(no O
comment). O

Restaurant B-TARGET
not O
to O
advise O
and O
especially O
to O
banish O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
that O
the O
profession O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
not O
scorned O
by O
this O
kind O
of O
pseudo O
restaurateur B-TARGET
who O
should O
think O
of O
changing O
profession. O

A O
very O
pink O
but O
pleasant O
setting B-TARGET
for O
dinners O
as O
a O
couple O
or O
with O
friends. O

Very O
well O
presented O
plates B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
welcome B-TARGET
with O
smiling O
people. O

But O
how O
can O
we O
give O
5 O
stars O
to O
an O
"Asian" O
restaurant O
where O
everything O
is O
only O
reheated, O
defrosted O
from O
the O
metro O
or O
promocash. O

There O
are O
even O
fries O
and O
nuggets! O

Really O
very O
exotic! O

Very O
good O
to O
take O
a O
tray O
to O
go O
(10€) O
and O
eat O
it O
in O
front O
of O
the O
TV. O

If O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
restaurant, O
don't O
go O
there! O

Warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
magnificent O
vaulted O
back B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
(old O
city O
wall), O
very O
good O
cooking, B-TARGET
wood-fired B-TARGET
grills, I-TARGET
quality O
products B-TARGET
and O
reasonable O
price. O

Not O
to O
be O
missed. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
pleasant; O
the O
cooking B-TARGET
correct, O
the O
reasonable O
prices, O
in O
short O
it O
is O
well O
but O
is O
it O
the O
number O
of O
people, O
the O
room, B-TARGET
... O
it O
misses O
a O
small O
something O
to O
be O
enthused. O

correct. O

but O
an O
impression O
of O
unfinished O
business. O

We O
are O
there, O
dish O
of O
the O
day O
tagliatelle O
with O
seafood, O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
but O
some O
rubbery, O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
reception B-TARGET
very O
average, O
saint B-TARGET
Jacques I-TARGET
good O
but O
very O
dry O
rice, B-TARGET
in O
short O
certainly O
better O
elsewhere! O

We O
discovered O
by O
chance O
this O
beach B-TARGET
hut I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
an O
excellent O
surprise: O
a O
very O
warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
very O
correct O
dishes, B-TARGET
a O
lounge-beach O
atmosphere B-TARGET
not O
overdone. O

We O
can O
see O
that O
the O
team B-TARGET
takes O
pleasure O
in O
working O
in O
this O
magical O
place. B-TARGET

It O
will O
be O
our O
must O
in O
Cassis! O

Very O
good O
table B-TARGET
in O
an O
alley O
behind O
the O
port O
so O
without O
having O
the O
parade O
of O
tourists O
who O
look O
at O
your O
plate. O

We O
find O
in O
this O
restaurant O
a O
perfumed O
Provençal B-TARGET
cooking, I-TARGET
presented O
very O
nicely O
and O
in O
generous O
quantity. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O
We O
had O
a O
very O
good O
time O
and O
we O
recommend O
this O
place. B-TARGET

We O
came O
in O
2 O
with O
our O
2 O
months O
old O
baby O
in O
stroller. O

We O
were O
put O
in O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
left O
after O
20 O
minutes O
without O
anyone O
coming O
to O
bring O
us O
even O
a O
carafe O
of O
water. O

I O
ate O
with O
friends O
in O
this O
restaurant O
and O
I O
find O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
seriously O
degraded, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
reception I-TARGET
comprises O
2 O
sheets, O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
and O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
are O
tainted O
in O
the O
presentation. O

Moreover, O
the O
reception B-TARGET
from O
the O
boss O
is O
cold O
unlike O
the O
very O
nice O
waiters. B-TARGET

The O
dishes O
are O
out O
of O
fashion. O

We O
took O
the O
aperitif O
on O
the O
terrace. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
were O
rather O
pleasant O
but O
not O
a O
peanut O
or O
an O
olive O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
aperitif O
unfortunately, O
no O
plate O
aperitif O
either. O

Incomprehensible O
for O
a O
bar-restaurant... B-TARGET

How O
can O
we O
call O
it O
a O
restaurant? B-TARGET

A O
deplorable O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
a O
mediocre O
cuisine B-TARGET
that O
has O
nothing O
to O
envy O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
freshness O
of O
the O
buffet B-TARGET
in O
particular. O

The O
next O
time O
we O
will O
be O
in O
Albertville, O
we O
will O
try O
another O
restaurant, O
can O
someone O
advise O
us O
one O
??? O

In O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
I O
felt O
at O
home O
having O
had O
a O
restaurant O
of O
the O
same O
kind. O

A O
tasty O
cuisine B-TARGET
made O
with O
love, O
I O
go O
back O
there O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
can O
for O
me O
it O
is O
a O
real O
restaurant B-TARGET

we O
came O
to O
14 O
people O
for O
the O
birthday O
of O
my O
boyfriend. O

We O
arrived O
around O
8-9pm. O

we O
all O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
large, O
good O
and O
hot O
dishes! B-TARGET

we O
ordered O
for O
the O
aperitif O
5 O
bottles O
of O
champagne O
+ O
4 O
bottles O
of O
wine O
for O
the O
dinner O
+ O
digestifs O
+ O
coffees. O

no O
commercial O
gesture O
at O
the O
payment, O
nothing O
offered O
nor O
proposed...??! O

in O
addition, O
one O
of O
the O
people O
ordered O
a O
tartare, O
she O
was O
served O
10 O
minutes O
after O
everyone O
else... O
it O
is O
a O
cold O
dish O
though. O

it's O
a O
shame! O

We O
arrive O
at O
5 O
for O
lunch O
last O
Sunday O
around O
1:30 O
pm. O

It's O
the O
end O
of O
the O
service. O

Starter: O
cold O
smelt O
fry O
for O
one O
of O
us. O

Three O
mussel O
casseroles O
arrive O
at O
the O
table, O
at O
the O
opening, O
the O
mussels B-TARGET
of O
one O
of O
them O
are O
covered O
with O
tomatoes O
and O
not O
the O
others. O

We O
ask O
the O
waiter O
if O
this O
is O
normal. O

After O
checking, O
he O
comes O
back O
and O
tells O
us O
that O
it O
is O
a O
decoration. O

Some O
of O
the O
mussels B-TARGET
are O
overcooked O
and O
others O
are O
undercooked. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
taste O
of O
oil. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
my O
mussel B-TARGET
casserole I-TARGET
I O
have O
the O
unpleasant O
surprise O
to O
find O
half O
a O
lemon, O
skin O
included, O
shredded. O

I O
ask O
the O
waiter O
if O
there O
is O
a O
problem. O

He O
comes O
back O
after O
checking O
and O
tells O
me O
that O
it O
is O
the O
recipe O
of O
the O
mussels O
marinière. O

I O
ask O
to O
see O
the O
manager. O

He O
arrives O
and O
when O
I O
tell O
him O
about O
my O
dissatisfaction, O
he O
asks O
me O
to O
"lower O
my O
voice". O

We O
stop O
eating O
immediately. O

The O
bill O
presented O
to O
us O
is O
deducted O
from O
a O
casserole O
when O
no O
one O
wants O
to O
eat O
these O
dubious O
mussels B-TARGET
anymore. O

We O
were O
then O
insulted O
again O
by O
the O
manager B-TARGET
before O
he O
agreed O
to O
cash O
in O
our O
drinks O
and O
let O
us O
go. O

We O
didn't O
expect O
great O
food O
in O
this O
very O
touristic O
place B-TARGET
but O
we O
would O
have O
appreciated O
to O
have O
lunch O
without O
putting O
our O
health O
in O
danger O
and O
without O
being O
disrespected O
on O
top O
of O
that! O

Go O
to O
the O
competitors O
they O
are O
very O
numerous O
in O
the O
area O
!!!! O

First O
time O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
of O
which O
we O
were O
told O
well. O

The O
proposed O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
original, O
the O
flavors O
interesting O
but O
the O
quality-price O
ratio O
is O
not O
there. O

18,50 O
€ O
a O
risotto, B-TARGET
where O
I O
looked O
for O
smoked O
salmon, O
which O
I O
unfortunately O
did O
not O
find, O
it O
is O
too O
expensive O
as O
good O
as O
it O
is. O

We O
paid O
for O
the O
colorful O
setting B-TARGET
and O
the O
tourist B-TARGET
port I-TARGET
of O
La O
Cotinière. O

If O
there O
was O
only O
that, O
it O
could O
have O
been O
fine O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
catastrophic. O

The O
young O
blonde O
lady O
who O
served O
us O
is O
absolutely O
not O
of O
the O
metier. O

The O
boss B-TARGET
took O
our O
order O
long O
after O
the O
end O
of O
the O
aperitif, O
and O
the O
worst O
was O
the O
wine B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
when O
we O
had O
almost O
finished O
our O
dish. O

Intolerable. O

In O
spite O
of O
a O
tasty O
cuisine B-TARGET
we O
will O
not O
go O
back. O

Very O
nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Small O
room O
with O
an O
Oléronaise O
beach O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Refined O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
tables O
(tablecloths O
and O
cloth O
napkins...). O

Very O
smiling O
and O
warm O
staff. O

Menus B-TARGET
a O
little O
expensive O
but O
very O
good. O

That O
said, O
for O
home-made O
food O
with O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
of O
very O
good O
quality, O
it O
remains O
very O
interesting. O

Copious O
and O
well O
presented O
dishes. B-TARGET

Very O
good, O
especially O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
(excellent). O

Coctails B-TARGET
very O
good O
but O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
the O
quantity O
(5/8€) O

Restaurant B-TARGET

out O
of O
season. O

Very O
pleasant O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
trees, O
nice O
plates, B-TARGET
well O
prepared O
fish, B-TARGET
nice O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Don't O
hesitate. O

The O
address O
is O
misleading, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
in O
Castelnaudary O
but O
in O
a O
small O
village O
just O
beyond. O

Call O
the O
owner B-TARGET
to O
find O
out, O
she O
is O
adorable. O

And O
make O
the O
detour, O
for O
a O
top O
and O
generous O
cassoulet. B-TARGET

With O
a O
small O
glass B-TARGET
of O
Minervois. O

And O
a O
little O
foie O
gras B-TARGET
just O
before. O

It's O
not O
for O
the O
diet. O

But O
when O
you O
eat O
well O
and O
good, O
you O
don't O
get O
fat. O

It's O
a O
pleasant O
stopover O
for O
us O
who O
were O
coming O
back O
from O
Bordeaux O
to O
the O
South O
East O
(the O
owner O
will O
probably O
recognize O
it!). O

We O
spent O
a O
good O
end O
of O
evening... O
or O
night. O

Thank O
you. O

friendly B-TARGET
welcome, O
very O
good O
quality O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
sometimes O
the O
hand O
is O
a O
little O
heavy O
on O
the O
salt, O
small O
problem O
rectified O
since. O

We O
recommend O
it! O

A O
cassoulet B-TARGET
frankly O
"foul", O
which O
is O
a O
disgrace O
to O
the O
name O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
for O
a O
so-called O
"traditional O
restaurant O
serving O
a O
chef's O
cuisine B-TARGET
made O
from O
raw O
product" O
(sic) O
... O
qualified O
as O
"Cassoulet O
fait O
Maison"! O

The O
owner O
came O
to O
see O
us O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
service, O
we O
were O
the O
first O
customers O
who O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
settle O
on O
his O
terrace, O
while O
the O
tables O
of O
the O
neighbouring O
restaurants O
were O
occupied... O
First O
to O
arrive, O
before O
last O
to O
get O
the O
bill, O
after O
a O
call. O

To O
be O
avoided O
as O
much O
for O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
as O
for O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Pitiful. O

A O
nice O
mistake O
of O
choice O
on O
our O
part. O

Don't O
do O
as O
we O
did! O

Totally O
disappointing O
and O
expensive O
meal! B-TARGET

For O
two O
starters, O
two O
main O
courses O
and O
two O
desserts O
à O
la O
carte O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
we O
found O
the O
meal B-TARGET
quite O
expensive O
for O
Castelnaudary O
(92€). O

In O
addition, O
everything O
came O
from O
canned O
or O
frozen O
food... B-TARGET

I O
totally O
advise O
against O
this O
"restaurant". B-TARGET

Well O
located. O

Nice O
service. B-TARGET

Honest O
pizza B-TARGET
but O
avoid O
the O
tiramisu. B-TARGET

Be O
careful O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
Italian... O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
know O
! O

Excellent O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
research. O

Bravo O
for O
the O
chef O
and O
the O
patissière O
; O
we O
will O
come O
back O
for O
the O
beef B-TARGET
tongue I-TARGET
! O

Very O
good O
traditional B-TARGET
cooking I-TARGET
in O
a O
typical O
place. O

But O
it O
is O
expensive. O

We O
only O
had O
one O
dish. O

It's O
a O
pity O
for O
this O
nice O
little O
restaurant. B-TARGET

But O
there O
are O
others O
as O
good O
and O
less O
expensive. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
is O
just O
indecent! O

Nothing O
good O
even O
the O
potato B-TARGET
was O
not O
cooked! O

Don't O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
well, O
but O
you O
can O
get O
into O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
those O
years. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
you O
should O
not O
ask O
for O
anything O
other O
than O
the O
owner's O
register, O
otherwise O
you O
will O
be O
told O
to O
go O
and O
buy O
the O
CD O
