The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

We O
enjoyed O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
on O
the O
main O
promenade B-TARGET
of O
Narbonne-Plage, O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
service. B-TARGET

We O
will O
be O
back! O

was O
expected O
to O
be O
better O
( O
wait, B-TARGET
average O
quality). O

Not O
bad, O
but O
no O
more. O

We O
do O
not O
think O
we O
can O
go O
back O
there O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
Impressive O
view B-TARGET
on O
the O
hippodrome O
and O
golf O
think O
to O
book O
down O
near O
the O
glass O
bays O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
good O
and O
in O
addition O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
with O
smile O

A O
little O
lady O
welcomes O
us O
without O
a O
smile O
but O
above O
all O
without O
enthusiasm, O
it O
had O
to O
condemn O
it O
to O
have O
customers O
on O
Tuesday O
evening.... O
3 O
tables. O

In O
short, O
let's O
move.... O

We O
still O
order O
pasta O
lambs, B-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cheese B-TARGET
without O
flavor O
on O
top, O
which O
reduced O
the O
acidity O
of O
tomato B-TARGET
concentrate...! I-TARGET

Desert B-TARGET
all O
but O
home....! O

I O
really O
don't O
advise, O
even O
if O
your O
fridge O
is O
empty O
and O
the O
others O
left O
by O
the O
side O
are O
full O
and O
you O
don't O
know O
where O
to O
go..... O

It's O
even O
better O
to O
go O
to O
Mc O
Do! O

Very O
pleasantly O
surprised! O

The O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
is O
very O
good O
and O
well O
served! O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
table I-TARGET
is O
really O
enthusiastic, O
you O
will O
be O
served O
a O
lot O
of O
delicious B-TARGET
cakes I-TARGET
or O
fresh O
cakes B-TARGET
made O
at O
home! O

It O
feels O
a O
bit O
like O
at O
home O
with O
well-established O
quality! O

And O
the O
team B-TARGET
is O
adorable! O

Go O
also O
for O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
which O
is O
very O
nice! O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

very O
well O

2 O
hours O
of O
expectations B-TARGET
minumum O
no O
service B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
management! O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
stay!! O

Old O
bosses O
had O
nothing O
to O
have, O
ny O
boss O
knows O
nothing O
about O
restoration O

Located O
in O
the O
small O
Venice O
with O
a O
terrace B-TARGET
by I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
water, I-TARGET
the O
location B-TARGET
seemed O
ideal O
for O
this O
day O
spent O
in O
Colmar. O

Then O
we O
were, O
say, O
surprised O
by O
the O
reception. B-TARGET

A O
rather O
daring O
character O
welcomed O
us O
heartily O
in O
view O
of O
his O
attitude. O

Although O
the O
meal B-TARGET
was O
quite O
copied O
and O
good, O
we O
did O
not O
enjoy O
it B-TARGET
as O
much O
as O
we O
expected. O

Was O
this O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
that O
wanted O
this? O

Other O
than O
this O
character, O
the O
other O
people O
in O
this O
restaurant O
were O
courtesy O
and O
very O
kind. O

At O
first O
it O
was O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
then O
little O
by O
little O
ca O
dropped O
in O
quality O
without O
stops! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
medium, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
also O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
quality O
and O
quantity O

We O
have O
been O
used O
to O
the O
establishment O
for O
3 O
years, O
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
only O
improving. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
working O
and O
changing O
regularly, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
professional, O
attentive O
and O
charming. O

Never O
disappointed O
for O
3 O
years. O

Continue! O

We O
went O
there O
by O
chance O
and O
were O
not O
disappointed! O

The O
warmth O
of O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
and O
the O
servers B-TARGET
contribute O
to O
a O
certain O
well-being!! O

Despite O
the O
world O
around O
us, O
we O
were O
quickly O
served. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
wine B-TARGET
offered O
were O
succulent. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
there! O

Minable O
Home! B-TARGET

What O
an O
exciting O
time! B-TARGET

First O
dish O
served: O
insects O
present! O

We O
warn O
staff B-TARGET
who O
reject O
fault O
on O
us O
(insects O
coming O
from O
outside). O

We O
are O
leaving O
a O
second O
chance. O

Second O
dish O
served: O
still O
INSECTES. O

Staff O
response: O
"If O
you O
didn't O
want O
insects, O
you O
had O
to O
eat O
inside!" O

I O
strongly O
reject O
it! O

I O
rarely O
eat O
daytime O
dishes O
in O
the O
restaurants O
I O
visit, O
but O
I O
made O
an O
exception O
this O
time. O

The O
people O
with O
whom O
I O
had O
breakfast O
ordered O
the O
pdj O
and O
so O
I O
did O
the O
same O
as O
they O
did O
history O
not O
to O
delay O
us. O

The O
hotel O
was O
excellent O
in O
quality/price O
and O
very O
good. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
from O
the O
boss O
is O
always O
kind O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
service O
dynamic O
and O
professional. O

Knowing O
her O
husband's O
cuisine B-TARGET
well, O
I O
am O
not O
surprised O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the B-TARGET
day's I-TARGET
meal. I-TARGET

The O
frame B-TARGET
has O
just O
been O
refurbished O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
and O
the O
colombage B-TARGET
house I-TARGET
that O
houses O
the O
restaurant O
has O
also O
been O
renovated, O
in O
short: O
What O
a O
positive O
thing. O

Small O
restaurant O
with O
careful O
décor, B-TARGET
well-stocked O
tables. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
warm, O
the O
service B-TARGET
will O
follow O
as O
well. O

The O
different O
menus B-TARGET
based O
on O
"Mezzés" O
are O
similar, O
the O
specialties O
are O
successful O
for O
some O
( O
hoummous, B-TARGET
taboulé..), B-TARGET
less O
successful O
for O
others O
such O
as O
for O
example O
the O
bakery B-TARGET
purée I-TARGET
fairly O
fade O
or O
these O
ballets B-TARGET
having O
a O
"burning" O
rear O
taste. O

We O
are O
in O
the O
classic O
of O
this O
kind O
with O
little O
surprise O
and O
rather O
high O
prices. O

Special O
mention, O
however, O
is O
made O
of O
the O
wine B-TARGET
(Lebanese) I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
the O
gesture O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
owner I-TARGET
who O
offered O
some O
desserts. O

Let's O
have O
a O
good O
evening O
anyway, O
but O
a O
desired O
effort O
on O
Mediterranean O
tastes O
and O
flavours! O

Don't O
miss O
out! O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
from O
all O
points O
of O
view O
the O
service B-TARGET
the O
manager B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
the O
excellent O
dishes B-TARGET
the O
wine B-TARGET
very O
good! O

Passing O
tourists O
in O
the O
area O
we O
will O
return O
there O
without O
hesitation O
next O
time O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants B-TARGET
made O
for O
a O
long O
time O

Bar O
tapas O
in O
the O
evening, O
changing O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
sometimes O
approximate. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
wanted O
to O
push O
the O
door O
of O
this O
place O
into O
the O
Bayonne O
harbour O
area O
and O
here O
we O
are!!! O

The O
deck B-TARGET
could O
be O
revived O
but O
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
good O
the O
ordering O
is O
quick O
and O
very O
welcoming. O

The O
restaurants B-TARGET
are O
classic O
but O
correct O
with O
a O
price O
that O
is O
also. O
Then O
see O
the O
musical B-TARGET
ambiance I-TARGET
that O
corresponds O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
one O
is O
made O
of O
its O
places. O

Good O
evening O
at O
this O
place B-TARGET

Beef B-TARGET
shaped O
chewing O
gum, O
dark O
brown O
fries B-TARGET
soft O
and O
still O
bathing O
in O
their O
oil. O

Austrian O
service. B-TARGET

What O
else O
can O
we O
say? O

We O
rarely O
ate O
as O
badly O
in O
Bordeaux. O

Already O
there O
is O
a O
big O
broken O
hygiene O
level: O
the O
cook O
goes O
out O
with O
his O
gloves O
and O
then O
returns O
to O
the O
kitchen O
without O
changing O
them... O

Then, O
uncooked O
meat B-TARGET
and O
soft O
fries.... B-TARGET
( O
sick O
the O
next O
day) O

In O
the O
evening O
there O
is O
no O
menu O
so O
it O
is O
very O
expensive O
(quality O
ratio O
\prix O
we O
do O
not O
find O
it O
in O
my O
sense). O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room O
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

In O
fact, O
the O
rather O
heavy O
reception B-TARGET
leaves O
room O
for O
a O
service B-TARGET
lacking O
enthusiasm O
and O
a O
smile. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
good, O
well O
cooked O
and O
presented O
but O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
are O
rather O
high O
and O
in O
the O
end, O
the O
score O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
in O
departure O
from O
the O
experience O
experienced O
(more O
than O
100€ O
to O
two O
for O
1 O
entrance/2 O
dishes/1 O
dessert O
with O
wine O
and O
coffee), O
in O
a O
rather O
successful O
vintage/russian O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
but O
tasted O
by O
a O
pop/variet O
music B-TARGET
unrelated O
to O
the O
framework O
and O

a O
little O
too O
strongly O
for O
a O

a O

and O
relaxation. O

My O
heartbeat O
for O

Amateur O

I O
went O
down O
to O
the O
cheese B-TARGET
shop, I-TARGET
in O

with O
more O
than O
200 O

time O
at O

here O
(my O
first O

with O
a O
welcoming O

Simple O
but O
effective O
for O
a O
dinner, O
to O
discover O
but O
midday O
it O
must O
be O
good. O

We O
were O
five O
for O
business O
lunch O
all O
it O
was O
very O
well O
passed O
we O
all O
found O
our O
excellent O

we O
will O
come O

Venus, O
as O
every O
year O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time, O
for O
my O
anniversary, O
I O
had O
reserved O
on O
the O

We O
arrive, O
the O
person O
responsible O
does O
not O
find O
us O
on O
the O

He O
tells O
us O
that O
he O
no O

watches O
the O
internet...Why O
offer O
the O
option O
in O
this O
case????? O

And O
let's O
see O
where O
he O
can... O

The O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room O
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

It's O
changed O
a O
lot, O
we O
won't O
put O
our O
foot O
back O
on O
it O
again..... O

It O
was O
15 O
years O
that O
I O
had O
not O
returned O

Very O
disappointed: O

Meals B-TARGET
not O

Digestion O
complicated O
the O
next O

all O
my O

Very O
long O
service, B-TARGET
the O
boss B-TARGET
who O
tells O
his O
life O
when O
the O
restaurant O
is O
crowded O
and O
everyone O
is O
waiting, O
mistakes O
in O
the O
dishes, O
noise O
in O
the O

We O
have O
been O
delivered O
several O
times O
and O
we O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
but O
the O
on-site O
service B-TARGET
is O
deplorable... O

However, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good O
and O
the O
déco B-TARGET
nice. O

Invited O
for O
a O
professional O
dinner O
(group O
of O
20 O
people) O
we O
were O
presented O
this O
restaurant O
as O
a O
good O
address O
of O
the O
city. O

So O
it O
was O
with O
mouth O
water O
that O
we O
were O
received O
in O
this O
facility. O

The O
staff O
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. B-TARGET
The O
room O
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

Small O
restaurant B-TARGET
suggested O
by O
a O
friend, O
we O
do O
not O
regret O
the O
experience! O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
meals B-TARGET
offered O
according O
to O
arrival, O
concise O
menu B-TARGET
but O
extremely O
tasty O
meals. B-TARGET

It O
is O
highly O
recommended. O

A O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
stay O
for O
meat O
lovers, O
a O
mouth-watering O
snack, B-TARGET
a O
simple O
but O
tasty O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
a O
glass O
of O
good O
quality O
wine. B-TARGET

I O
really O
warmly O
recommend O
this O
address. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
everything... O
:-) O

Hospitality O
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
pleasant O
and O
efficient O

All O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good O
with O
a O
special O
mention O
for O
the O
breton B-TARGET

Restaurant B-TARGET
open O
at O
midday O
it's O
better O
to O
arrive O
early O

Icehouse, B-TARGET
barely O
installed O
and O
the O
card O
in O
hand O
that O
you O
come O
to O
order. O

Spend O
three-quarters O
of O
an O
hour O
just O
having O
your O
meal. O

In O
fact, O
it O
is O
flat O
which O
is O
largely O
transmitted O
from O
hand O
to O
hand. O

I O
don't O
call O
it O
a O
restaurant-worthy O
service. B-TARGET

A O
meat B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
cooked O
as O
requested: O
saignante O
and O
not O
sophisticated O
as O
requested. O

No O
dessert O
orders O
were O
received O
after O
a O
half-hour O
wait O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal. O

So O
we O
decided O
to O
leave O
without O
dessert! O

It B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
as O
unpleasant O
as O
the O
reception. B-TARGET

I O
was O
disappointed O
with O
our O
evening O
because O
I O
experienced O
this O
tavern B-TARGET
on O
better O
days. O

Very O
expensive O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food. B-TARGET

A O
quality/price B-TARGET
ratio O
that O
is O
therefore O
commentary. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
+++. O

We O
rarely O
ate O
such O
poor O
pizzas... B-TARGET
uncooked, O
poorly O
served,... O

AFFREUX!!! O
to O
discourage!!! O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET
Lunch O
served O
in O
group. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
fast O
enough O
considering O
the O
number O
of O
tables, O
well-filled O
seat, B-TARGET
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
sufficient O
choice O

A O
very O
nice O
rest B-TARGET

simple O
decontracted O
location. B-TARGET

without O

atypical O
pattern B-TARGET
but O
to O
be O
known. O

very O
listening O
to O
it!! O

First O
time O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
height O
of O
the O
kitchen O
in O
the O
remnants O
that O
I O
visit O
in O
Rennes, O
damage. O

Map B-TARGET

on O
a O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET

served O
more O
generously O
previously O
(at O
5.90€ O
the O
glass, O
the O
behaviour O
of O
the O
patron B-TARGET
(?) O
is O
disappointing). O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
good, O
well O
cooked O
as O
requested. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
soft, O
too, O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
serves O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
potatoes. O

In O
short, O
a O
formula B-TARGET
at O
the O
right O
prices O
for O
downtown, O
a O
real O
potential O
but O
a O
lack O
of O
commercial O
sense O
and O
small O
tricks O
that O
intersect... O
even O
more O
tribute, O
especially O
for O
having O
done O
it O

A O
patron O
who O
could O
be O
a O
case O
of O
school O
in O
hotel O
schools. O

He O
does O
not O
say O
good-bye, O
lowers O
his O
head, O
does O
not O
look O
you O
in O
the O
eye O
and O
gives O
the O
feeling O
that O
you O
annoy O
him. O

I O
have O
been O
able O
to O
thank O
him O
for O
his O
service O
and O
apologize O
for O
disturbing O
him O
during O
his O
work. O

He O
told O
me O
that O
it O
was O
boring O
to O
work O
on O
Sundays. O

I O
live O
in O
Dijon O
and O
this O
is O
the O
last O
time O
I've O
been O
there. O

We O
always O
like O
to O
get O
back O
"in O
Italian" O
in O
this O
little O
dijonese O
restaurant. B-TARGET

But O
the O
last O
time, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
less O
good: O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
paste I-TARGET
was O
hard O
to O
cut, O
shouldn't O
the O
patron O
buy O
new O
knives, O
becauseIKEA's O
knives O
are O
lacking O
for O
this O
frozen O
dish. O

And O
it's O
still O
hard O
to O
come O
and O
eat O
without O
having O
reserved! O

On O
the O
Place B-TARGET
du I-TARGET
Bareuzay, I-TARGET
symbolic O
of O
Dijon, O
a O
pleasant O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
trivial, O
with O
a O
classic O
"bourguignons O
place" O
option. O

Map B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
very O
limited O
in O
choice O
both O
in O
quantity O
and O
quality. O

We O
ate O
an O
andouillette O
dijonnaise O
sauce O
with O
mustard O
and O
its O
accompaniment O
of O
fries O
and O
an O
andouillette O
with O
small O
vegetables O
and O
purée. O

The O
andouillette B-TARGET
which O
was O
not O
a O
5A O
was O
excellent, O
the O
fries, B-TARGET
vegetables B-TARGET
and O
purée B-TARGET
also. O

Overall O
satisfactory. O

There O
is O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
at O
the O
service B-TARGET
if O
it O
is O
not O
a O
hurry O
to O
close O
the O
shop! O

On O
the O
form: O
the O
hotel B-TARGET
is O
rather O
well O
decorated, O
bright O
and O
pleasant, O
totally O
in O
the O
American O
style. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
is O
kind O
and O
welcoming, O
although O
sometimes O
he O
is O
a O
little O
too O
kind, O
but O
that's O
better. O

In O
essence: O
I O
went O
there O
twice O
in O
the O
last O
3 O
months O
to O
eat O
a O
hamburger O
and O
frankly O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
dining O
table B-TARGET
is O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
and O
this O
is O
really O
where O
the O
problem O
lies. O

Hamburgers B-TARGET
are O
sold O
for O
between O
12 O
and O
16 O
euros, O
which O
is O
far O
too O
much O
for O
very O
industrial O
preparations: B-TARGET
baked O
bread, B-TARGET
no O
vegetables O
in O
the O
sandwich B-TARGET
and O
fries B-TARGET
that O
are O
not O
made O
at O
home. O

In O
short, O
this O
facility O
is O
a O
bit O
like O
Canada O
Dry, O
it O
looks O
but O
it's O
not.... O

An O
old O
experience O
at O
this O
institution O
in O
2013 O
gave O
me O
the O
desire O
to O
return O

If O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
the O
setting B-TARGET
are O
pleasant, O
do O
not O
be O
pressed, O
2h30 O
for O
the O
menus O
of O
the O
day, O
it O
starts O
to O
make O

In O
addition O
7 O
euros O
50 O
for O
two O
mimosa B-TARGET
eggs I-TARGET
without O
blossoms O
is O
simply O
the O
flight O

I'm O
passing O
you O
tasty O
and O
unsuspecting O
foods B-TARGET

The O
coffee O
offered O
can't O
do O
everything O

So O
disappointed O
with O
my O
second O
experience, O
my O
money O
door O
will O
remember O
it O

We O
had O
a O
family O
lunch O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
hotel B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
friendly. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
generous. O

Having O
been O
able O
to O
taste O
the O
mountain B-TARGET
crêpe, I-TARGET
it O
is O
copieus O
and O
well O
preserved. O

The O
cider, B-TARGET
not O
only O
exceptional, O
is O
fresh O
and O
well O
accompanied. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
price, O
I O
do O
not O
find O
them O
excessive O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
served. O

Doing O
with O
family, O
couple O
or O
friends O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice O
and O
comfortable. O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
bright, O
it O
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
very O
relaxing. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

service B-TARGET
is O
nickel. O

Very O
disappointed: O
Vaisselle, B-TARGET
decor B-TARGET
a O
bit O
old. O

It O
is O
not O
very O
clean. O

We O
had O
to O
ask O
twice O
for O
a O
meal O
to O
get O
the O
wine O
we O
had O
taken O
as O
an O
aperitif. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
not O
served O
at O
the O
right O
temperature. O

Beautiful O
glasses O
would O
have O
been O
appreciated O
to O
drink O
a O
good O
wine. B-TARGET

For O
the O
dish O
the O
server O
told O
us O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
served O
with O
a O
liver O
sauce, O
we O
did O
not O
find O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
liver O
because O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
a O
wine B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
that O
completely O
masked O
the O
liver. O

For O
the O
farandole B-TARGET
dessert O
dessert: O
nothing O
extraordinary O
than O
classics O
with O
lots O
of O
butter O
cream. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
you O
don't O
come O
out O
with O
hunger O
because O
it's O
copied. O

In O
conclusion, O
it O
is O
far O
too O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
have O
eaten: O
lack O
of O
originality O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
enough. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
can O
only O
be O
said O
to O
be O
good. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
simply O
incredible O
/ O
the O
unique O
menu B-TARGET
has O
36 O
euros O
makes O
you O
discover O
some O
typical O
Corsican O
dishes.... O

Attention O
menu B-TARGET
pantagruelique... O

From O
the O
good O
grandmother's O
cuisine B-TARGET
that O
sticks O
to O
the O
body. O

And O
to O
win O
the O
whole O
nice O
servers B-TARGET
has O
the O
accent O
pronounced O
with O
always O
a O
touch O
of O
humour. O

Frankly...when O
you O
come O
from O
the O
Basque O
country... O

We O
appreciate O
the O
warmth O
of O
Korea O
like O
this! O

Bravo O

Not O
bad. O

Dry O
pizza, B-TARGET
very O
few O
ingredients O
and O
a O
very O
dry O
enourme O
edge O
for O
the O
Regina O
bianca. O

It O
is O
certainly O
not O
worth O
the O
price... O

Small O
nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
during O
our O
2h O
stop O
after O
our O
boat O
ride. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
right O
for O
a O
quick O
stop, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
scenery B-TARGET
was O
beautiful. O

Really O
horrible O
some O
things B-TARGET
are O
heated, O
some O
are O
not O
cooked, O
you O
can't O
call O
it O
kitchen! O

Absolutely O
none! O

Great O
burgers, B-TARGET
we O
are O
thrilled O
as O
soon O
as O
we've O
tasted. O

The O
" O
complete B-TARGET
" O
is O
famous, O
as O
much O
as O
the O
" O
samourai B-TARGET
" O
of O
its O
competitor O
the O
bigban. B-TARGET

I O
miss O
that! O

unique O
in O
Besançon. O

In O
addition, O
the O
chef B-TARGET
is O
adorable. O

To O
carry O
only. O

Yes, O
it O
has O
been O
prevented, O

Yes, O
it's O
free, O

Yes, O
it's O
rather O
sophisticated O

But O
then: O

The O
advertised O
complexity O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
is O
it O
or? O

It O
is O
not O
to O
fall O
on O
the O
ground O

There O
may O
be O
"on-the-cob" O
sauces B-TARGET
in O
kitchen O
dishes O

In O
short, O
nothing O
to O
justify O
3 O
hours O
at O
table O
for O
2 O
seats O
for O
4 O
people, O
if O
this O
is O
not O
a O
good O
way O
to O
distinguish O
yourself O
from O
the O
other O
rest O
of O
Viêt/thaï. O

Good O

PASSTIME O
REFUSSION O

It's O
a O
BELLE O
ARNAQUE!!!! O

It O
was O
INSULTERed O
by O
the O
responsible B-TARGET
on O
December O
20, O
2014 O
it O
is O
INADMISSIBLE!!!! O

Damage O
to O
employers O
who O
lose O
the O
world O
because O
of O
the O
employee B-TARGET
who O
takes O
for O
a O
boss O
right! O

A O
very O
nice O
young O
server B-TARGET
I O
complain O
about! O

ADIEU!!! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

The O
other O
maid O
was, O
for O
her O
part, O
very O
left O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

And O
to O
perfect O
the O
whole O
the O
very O
strong O
music B-TARGET
of O
the O
lounge O
space O
prevents O
any O
conversation O
between O
the O
guests O
which O
is O
a O
pity O
because O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good O
in O
its O
entirety O
except O
desserts B-TARGET
that O
have O
been O
sold O
to O
us O
as O
home O
desserts O
but O
which O
seem O
rather O
to O
come O
out O
of O
Metro O
or O
other O
food O
suppliers! O

To O
conclude, O
the O
map O
contains O
some O
spelling O
mistakes. O

Very O
little O
would O
be O
enough O
to O
improve O
the O
overall O
situation. O

A O
simple O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
fresh O
and O
home-made O
products. B-TARGET

A B-TARGET
warm I-TARGET
welcome. I-TARGET

Even O
the O
small O
biscuits B-TARGET
accompanying O
the O
coffee O
are O
made O
at O
home. O

Nothing O
to O
say, O
simple O
but O
very O
good O
and O
very O
fresh. O

Home B-TARGET
at O
the O
top! O

The O
hotel B-TARGET
is O
located O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
city, O
close O
to O
the O
train O
station O
and O
to O
the O
city O
centre. O

Kir O
offered O
with O
an O
appetite O
boost O
with O
rillettes O
and O
sausage. O

There O
is O
little O
choice O
at O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
also O
like O
that O
you O
have O
more O
chance O
to O
make O
good O
dishes! B-TARGET

And O
it O
is O
successful! O

This O
is O
my O
canteen O
I O
love! O

Continue O
like O
this O
I O
warmly O
encourage O
you! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

It O
would O
be O
interesting O
to O
find O
young O
artists O
who O
regularly O
perform O
there. O

Unfortunately, O
they O
are O
not O
very O
respected: O
poor O
acoustics, O
noisy O
public. O

Managers O
should O
be O
encouraged O
to O
provide O
soundproofing. O

The O
concept O
seemed O
nice, O
but O
who O
is O
to O
be O
mocked? O

The O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
microscopic O
and O
the O
prices O
stratospheric! O

To O
buy O
about O
20€ O
for O
a O
coconut B-TARGET
egg O
(even O
not O
cooked O
properly), O
a O
plate B-TARGET
consisting O
of O
about O
50g O
chicken O
and O
3 O
green O
beans O
and O
two O
rounds O
of O
potatoes O
and O
a O
fruit O
salad... O

Ambience B-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
extremely O
noisy. O

In O
short, O
to O
flee, O
unless O
you O
really O
haven't O
been O
hungry... O

Good O
cooking B-TARGET
but O
added O
salt O
in O
the O
end O

Plates B-TARGET
well O
done, O
sauces B-TARGET
are O
also O
good O

Very O
good O
but O
slightly O
too O
fat O
shrimp B-TARGET
and O
poultry B-TARGET
paddle O

The O
veal B-TARGET
was O
tasty O

The O
Divine O
Tatin B-TARGET
Pie O

Very O
nice O
hotel O
in O
this O
small O
restaurant. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
attentive, O
the O
room B-TARGET
was O
small O
but O
very O
pleasant O

At O
the O
level O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
c O
is O
correct O
but O
it O
is O
not O
exceptional! O

(I O
am O
a O
fan O
of O
Italian O
cuisine O
and O
I O
regularly O
go O
to O
Italy O
so O
I O
am O
quite O
difficult!) O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
The O
chocolate B-TARGET
base I-TARGET
is O
very O
good O

Good O
service, O
excellent O
turbot B-TARGET
pave O
and O
good O
prices O
for O
the O
neighborhood. O

And O
to O
round O
it O
all O
up, O
a O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
smile O
from O
beginning O
to O
end O
:)! O

I O
always O
come O
back O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
with O
a O
real O
pleasure! O

Restaurant B-TARGET
now O
to O
avoid. O

Poor O
price O
quality. O

The O
starter B-TARGET
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
300 O
g O
on O
the O
menu O
was O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
school's O
canteen O
ash. O

And O
generally O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
ridiculous O
for O
their O
price. O

Salted B-TARGET
apples I-TARGET
were O
simple O
fries. O

Damage, O
because O
the O
decor B-TARGET
remains O
impressive. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

It O
is O
not O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
all O
scholarships, O
however, O
it O
is O
very O
expensive. O

If O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
correct O
( O
saint B-TARGET
jacques I-TARGET
- O
risotto O
)...it O
shouldn't O
have O
been O
too O
hungry...only O
three O
saint O
jacques O
all O
hardly O
hot. O

For O
the O
other O
dishes, B-TARGET
no O
green O
vegetables O
are O
offered O
as O
an O
accompaniment O
you O
should O
be O
content O
with O
fries, O
purée O
de O
pomme O
de O
terre O
risotto O
or O
vegetables O
of O
pot O
au O
feu....The O
service B-TARGET
does O
not O
exist, O
to O
the O
question O
that O
there O
is O
in O
the O
gourmet O
coffee O
the O
answer O
was O
that O
depends... O

A O
maid B-TARGET
who O
rubs O
her O
hair O
behind O
the O
bar...And O
the O
little O
touch O
that O
goes O
well O
we O
came O
out O
imprégné O
d'une O
odeur O
de O
friture... O

In O
short, O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
make O
a O
turn O
to O
get O
back O
in O
this O
bistro. B-TARGET

Always O
very O
busy O
midday, O
I O
only O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
go O
there O
in O
the O
evening. O

And O
every O
time, O
no O
disappointment: O
varied O
menu, B-TARGET
fresh O
and O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
delicious O
dishes, B-TARGET
copieous O
portions B-TARGET
and O
very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Prices O
remain O
correct O
as O
well. O

So O
advise! O

That's O
three O
times O
now O
that O
I'm O
going O
to O
dine O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
three O
times O
that O
I'm O
still O
settling O
down. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
in O
good O
quantities. O

There O
are O
all O
kinds O
of O
desires O
(meat, O
fish). O

I O
strongly O
recommend O
the O
mussel B-TARGET
cassolette I-TARGET
or O
the O
boudin B-TARGET
(if O
it O
comes O
back O
to O
the O
card), O
but O
overall, O
everything O
is O
fine. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
base I-TARGET
is O
generous O
and O
excellent, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
little O
space O
left. O

So O
we O
will O
understand O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
heart: O
go O
there O
with O
friends O
or O
lovers O
you O
will O
never O
be O
disappointed! O

We O
came O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
family O
dinner O
at O
the O
end O
of O
November O
2014. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time. O

A O
small O
hike: O
the O
two-person O
carnival B-TARGET
table I-TARGET
offered O
for O
the O
aperitif O
was O
not O
really O
copied, O
even O
for O
two O
people. O

But O
for O
the O
rest, O
varied O
cuisine, B-TARGET
good O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
we O
will O
come O
back! O

Very O
long O
and O
glacial O
service. B-TARGET

Food B-TARGET
frozen O
and O
badly O
defrosted. O

For O
the O
same O
price, O
you O
will O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
addresses O
in O
this O
same O
street! O

Dinner O
with O
friends O
and O
an O
awful O
experience. O

Service B-TARGET
with O
incredible O
slowness. O

A O
single O
menu B-TARGET
imposed O
for O
the O
table O
of O
ten O
(!!!). O

A O
terrible O
choice. B-TARGET

Poor O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

Delicious O

- O
especially O
don't O
ever O
take O
the O
beef B-TARGET
of O
a O
delicious O
delicious O

Avoid!!!! O

It O
is O
priceless O
that O
restaurants B-TARGET
like O
this O
one O
exist O
in O
Paris... O

For O
the O
deumer, O
it O
is O
an O
original O
place B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
its O
anniversary... O

We O
were O
a O
15-year-old O
on O
a O
Friday O
night, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
excruciating, O
cold O
dishes, B-TARGET
unfriendly, O
restaurant B-TARGET
so O
dark O
that O
you O
can't O
see O
what O
you O
eat O
there O
(I O
understand O
why O
now...) O

The O
server B-TARGET
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
accuse O
its O
clients O
of O
not O
paying O
(while O
it O
is O
his O
job O
to O
calculate O
correctly..) O
the O
manager O
is O
aggressive O
and O
puts O
his O
clients O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
they O
have O
not O
paid.... O

In O
short, O
15 O
people O
who O
will O
no O
longer O
return.... O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were I-TARGET
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room O
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
avoid. O

Positive: O
welcoming O
reception, B-TARGET
friendly O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
charming O
setting B-TARGET

Negative: O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
table B-TARGET

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
short, O
which O
may O
be O
an O
advantage O
(important O
turn-over O
thus O
sharper O
products) O
but O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
a O
disadvantage O
when O
there O
are O
products B-TARGET
missing O
(the O
truffle O
that O
day), O
so O
limited O
choice. O

We O
had O
the O
mistake O
of O
leaning O
on O
a O
burger B-TARGET
and O
a O
fish B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chips, I-TARGET
fatal O
mistake: O
medium O
burger, O
soft O
and O
fat O
fries, B-TARGET
as O
for O
the O
fish O
and O
chips O
impression O
to O
ingurgitate O
only O
fat-filled O
fried O
pasta. O

Although O
delicious, O
the O
trophian B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
was O
not O
enough O
to O
catch O
this O
late O
lunch. O

One O
would O
have O
to O
be O
afraid O
of O
the O
almost O
empty O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
a O
Friday O
night. O

Under O
the O
pretext O
of O
inventory, O
he O
was O
missing O
half O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
entrances B-TARGET
and O
wines. B-TARGET

The O
whole O
meal O
was O
cold. O

The O
toilets O
are O
dirty O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
as O
involuntary O
as O
possible. O

What O
a O
disappointment! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
still O
good O
but O
mild. O

Great O
disappointment, O
poor O
reception. B-TARGET

Request O
for O
change O
of O
seat O
because O
we O
were O
close O
to O
the O
door O
but O
we O
stayed O
unanswered. O

We O
had O
the O
impression O
that O
we O
were O
being O
misled O
because O
he O
said O
to O
his O
colleague, O
"Pff O
they O
want O
to O
change O
their O
place." O

Chicken B-TARGET

that O
the O
quantities O
are O
not O
the O
same O
between O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
plate O
at O
the O
card. O

This O
was O
the O
first O
and O
last O
time. O

It O
is O
a O
shame O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
run O
away O
from. O

42€ O
for O
two O
glasses B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
- O
barely O
enough O
- O
without O
giving O
us O
the O
card, O
of O
course. O

Antipathic O
servers B-TARGET
as O
possible. O

Beds O
and O
a O
depressing O
interior. B-TARGET

Needless O
to O
say, O
this O
bar B-TARGET
is O
awful O

Old-fashioned O
decoration, B-TARGET
dirty O
and O
greasy O
menus, B-TARGET
non-existent O
service, B-TARGET
a O
hot O
beer B-TARGET
that O
has O
not O
even O
been O
changed, O
too O
cooked O
meats B-TARGET
( O
accompanied O
by O
pears!!) O
and O
limited O
varied... O

In O
short, O
a O
scandal!!! O
Avoid!!! O

Very O
good O
biscuits. B-TARGET

The O
hotel B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
the O
staff O
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

Bistrot B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
especially O
if O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
moment O
in O
Montmartre O
without O
being O
in O
the O
cohue O
of O
tourist O
restaurants!!! O

But O
think O
about O
booking O
because O
there O
are O
not O
many O
places O
and O
the O
bistro B-TARGET
fills O
up O
quickly!!! O

I O
had O
rarely O
seen O
it O

The O
veal B-TARGET
was O
so O
old... O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
called O
the O
bad O
healthy O
beef... O

The O
ham B-TARGET
was O
ripe O

Collapsing O
legs B-TARGET

Fixed O
and O
soft O

and O
they O
tend O
to O
call O
it O
Saltimbocca O
Escalope... O

At O
18 O

The O
rosé B-TARGET
glass I-TARGET
had O
to O
come O
from O
a O
cubic O
bottom O

As O
for O
service, B-TARGET
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
talk O
about O
it O

No O
smile, O
no O
friendly O
word O

We O
have O
to O
make O
them O
eat O
the O
food B-TARGET
in O
the O
restaurant..... O

Avoid O
at O
all O
costs O

In O
the O
neighbourhood O
for O
the O
price O
of O
a O
meal O
you O
will O
have O
a O
full O
meal O
accompanied O
by O
a O
smile O

Very O
disappointing O
despite O
a O
very O
good O
location. B-TARGET

Servant B-TARGET
not O
at O
all O
sympathetic O
with O
a O
very O
black O
humour O
and O
neither O
thank O
you O
or O
nothing O
to O
leave. O

The O
service O
is O
far O
too O
fast O
to O
be O
done O
on-line. O

The O
salmon B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
fresh O
and O
the O
duck B-TARGET
was O
not O
cooked O
enough. O

Home-made B-TARGET
desserts I-TARGET
appear O
to O
be O
correct. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
in O
this O
small O
and O
elegant O
restaurant. O

The O
20-euro B-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
are O
served O
at O
midday O
and O
evening O
and O
include O
entrance O
+ O
dinner O
+ O
dessert. O

We O
went O
there O
between O
colleagues O
at O
midday O
and O
it O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
efficient O
and O
the O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

You O
can O
also O
take O
the O
34 O
euro O
more O
sophisticated O
menu B-TARGET
or O
choose O
the O
card. O

A O
real O
luxury: O
a O
quiet O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Paris! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

The O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

We O
sit O
at O
a O
table, O
and O
then O
we O
are O
asked O
to O
move. O

We O
choose O
our O
menu, O
the O
carpaccio B-TARGET
comes O
from O
the O
subway O
is O
sure O
and O
the O
fries B-TARGET
are O
not O
fresh. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
which O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
a O
mousse. O

It's O
more O
of O
a O
pulp O
thing, O
too O
sweet. O

Water O
bottle O
requested O
twice O
before O
having O
it. O

A O
little O
more: O
A O
server B-TARGET
offered O
us O
an O
aperitif. O

But O
to O
a O
slightly O
displaced O
attitude, O
a O
nasty O
limit O
of O
a O
bigger O
dragger. O

This O
may O
please O
some O
people, O
but O
our O
table O
has O
been O
disturbed O
by O
it. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend, O
there O
are O
smaller O
breweries O
better O
and O
cheaper O
on O
bets. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
in O
a O
pedestrian B-TARGET
street I-TARGET
dedicated O
to O
mass O
tourists O
and O
is O
surrounded O
by O
other O
restaurants O
of O
the O
same O
acabit. O

The O
animation B-TARGET
is O
painful O
and O
noisy O
and O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
kind O
of O
establishment O
we O
were O
looking O
for. O

The O
food B-TARGET
there O
is O
more O
than O
poor O
(fried O
fish, B-TARGET
saltless O
flour B-TARGET
plate, I-TARGET
insipid O
desserts) B-TARGET
and O
also O
an O
unexisting O
service B-TARGET
plus O
an O
addition O
more O
than O
salt. O

The O
service B-TARGET
in O
this O
more O
than O
typical O
Parisian O
bistro B-TARGET
is O
pleasantly O
good. O

And O
that's O
all. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
disgusting, O
too O
fat O
with O
an O
unpleasant O
taste. O

Prices O
as O
you O
can O
imagine O
in O
this O
type O
of O
establishment O
not O
too O
high O
but O
still O
too O
high O
for O
the O
quality O
served. O

Everything O
was O
bad. O

Starting O
with O
thin O
and O
tiny O
scarlets, B-TARGET
the O
intersection B-TARGET
is O
full O
of O
veins O
without O
taste O
and O
without O
texture. O

The O
maids B-TARGET
are O
totally O
absent O
and O
incompetent, O
and O
the O
blind O
person O
in O
charge O
has O
everything. O

What O
a O
joke O
and O
finally O
an O
addition O
of O
75€ O
when O
I O
could O
not O
eat O
anything! O

Avoid O
like O
the O
plague O

A O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
typical O
of O
Paris, O
but O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
delicious! O

Entry B-TARGET
to O
the O
hot O
goat, O
followed O
by O
a O
sweet O
duck B-TARGET
magret/citron I-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
sautéed O
apples, O
a O
real O
delight! O

Their O
basement B-TARGET
is O
also O
excellent! O

In O
short, O
an O
address B-TARGET
to O
remember O
and O
where O
I O
would O
return! O

Choice O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
say O
about O
willingness. O

The O
location B-TARGET
was O
nice O
but O
the O
staff O
service B-TARGET
was O
not O
at O
your O
disposal O

Food B-TARGET
is O

Choice O

No O

we O

Employees B-TARGET
do O
not O

The O
only O

point O
is O
hot B-TARGET

Nice O

of O
a O

an O

that O
would O
be O
most O
pleasant O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
not O
detestable O
and O
anything O
but O
professional: O

- O
An O
unloving O
head B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
who O
gives O
you O
the O
impression O
that O
you've O
been O
distracted O
after O
barely O
stepping O
into O
the O
institution O

- O
Pressure O
cushions/cushions B-TARGET
(including O
at O

rare O

Special O
mention O
to O
the O
bartender B-TARGET
who O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
only O
friendly O
person O
in O
the O
place O

In O
short, O
the O
quality O
of O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
compliment O
for O
an O
establishment B-TARGET
that O
highlights O
its O
New O
York O
influences! O

After O
a O
fourth O
visit O
and O
an O
identical O
finding, O
I O
would O
no O
longer O
put O
my O
feet O
on O
it! O

Let's O
be O
clear, O
this O
is O
our O
favorite O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Paris! O

We O
have O
been O
there O
5 O
or O
6 O
times O
already O
and O
each O
time O
we O
settled O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
given O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
are O
in O
Paris. O

Last O
Thursday O
we O
especially O
appreciated O
the O
concoction B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
with O
its O
gnocchis B-TARGET
(the O
best O
I've O
been O
brought O
to O
taste) O
and O
its O
spines. O

For O
dessert, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
irresistible O
lemon B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
served I-TARGET
otherwise, I-TARGET
we O
also O
settled O
with O
the O
lost B-TARGET
brooch...Superbe! I-TARGET

Entrance, O
dinner, O
dessert O
at O
30€ O
in O
the O
evening, O
wine O
at O
8€. O

In O
short, O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
have O
an O
opportunity O
to O
celebrate, O
we O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Last O
but O
not O
least, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
super O
and O
delicious! O

Everything O
was O
very O
good: O
welcome B-TARGET

all O
the O

a O
very O
good O
evening! O

very O
affordable O
price O
- O
I'm O
already O
very O
eager O
to O
return O
there O
to O
discover O
our O
heart O
to O
our O
friends!! O

Great O
disappointment! O

The O
map B-TARGET
advertises O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
dishes O
and O
we O
have O
unfortunately O
had O
some O
dishes, B-TARGET
see O
very O
affordable O
at O
prices O
that O
exceed O
the O
service. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it... O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

Avoid. O

I O
can't O
give O
notes. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

Classic O
biscuits, B-TARGET
for O
"parisian" O
prices O
(15-20 O
euros). O

Go O
there O
if O
you O
live O
in O
the O
neighbourhood, O
or O
at O
midday O
when O
the O
formulas B-TARGET
are O
more O
affordable. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
during O
the O
summer O
is O
very O
nice O
and O
quite O
spacious, O
ideal O
for O
a O
drink. O

The O
only O
strength O
is O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

Very O
pleasant. O

Service B-TARGET
almost O
non-existent. O

But O
where O
are O
they O
going O
to O
look O
for O
their O
maids B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
servers? I-TARGET

No O
professionalism. O

At O
the O
kitchen O
level, O

Freezing O
prevails. O

Suspicious O
freshness. O
Industrial O
desserts. B-TARGET

Only O
for O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
terrace O
and O
dinner O
OTHERS. O

Small O
brewery, O
nice O
map B-TARGET
and O
very O
crowded, O
the O
servers B-TARGET
are O
not O
very O
nice, O
performance O
first O
of O
all. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
is O
properly O
served, O
the O
gratin B-TARGET
feels O
the O
garlic O
at O
3 O
meters. O

A O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
served O
almost O
frozen. O

Spaguetti B-TARGET
carbonara I-TARGET
that O
bathes O
in O
the O
cream B-TARGET
completely O
liquid, O
the O
reception B-TARGET
not O
very O
pleasant, O
I O
would O
not O
return O
there. O

What O
a O
surprise O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
brewery-restaurant O
where O
although O
the O
servers O
have O
kept O
the O
style O
of O
the O
large O
breweries O
but O
the O
service O
is O
a O
little O
direct O
and O
the O
cuisine O
is O
really O
not O
up O
to O
the O
addition O
because O
without O
moving O
farther O
you O
can O
find O
other O
tables O
which O
they O
sometimes O
away O
from O
the O
large O
towers O
remain O
reasonable O
but O
respect O
the O
client. O

both O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
by O
the O
hospitality; B-TARGET

In O
summary, O
if O
you O
can O
avoid O
this O
tourist O
trap O
do O
not O
hesitate. O

In O
this O
very O
touristic O
neighbourhood, B-TARGET
this O
small O
unpretentious O
restaurant B-TARGET
offers O
cheap O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
even O
a O
very O
accessible O
menu B-TARGET
formula. I-TARGET

Although O
it O
is O
not O
a O
large O
kitchen, B-TARGET
the O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
quite O
honest. O

Excellent O
location B-TARGET
with O
great O
potential O
but O
everything O
was O
nothing. O

Huge O
wait B-TARGET
to O
take O
the O
order O
and O
when O
the O
server B-TARGET
finally O
comes, O
it O
takes O
the O
order O
of O
the O
last O
arrived. O

Long O
wait B-TARGET
to O
get O
his O
drinks. O

Many O
people O
lost O
patience O
and O
left. O

Not O
friendly O
servants B-TARGET
at O
all, O
no O
class. O

The O
worst O
was O
at O
the O
time O
of O
payment. O

Because O
of O
the O
slowness O
of O
a O
server B-TARGET
getting O
to O
us, O
we O
went O
to O
the O
cash O
registers O
to O
pay. O

One O
of O
the O
servers B-TARGET
was O
quick O
this O
time O
to O
come O
to O
us O
because O
it O
looked O
like O
we O
were O
going O
to O
leave O
without O
paying. O

He O
gave O
us O
an O
unworthy O
look. O

Really O
the O
service B-TARGET
will O
have O
been O
horrible O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end O
and O
those O
for O
most O
of O
the O
customers O
who O
were O
installed O
around O
us. O

Flyzzz O

They O
gave O
us O
the O
wrong O
dish, O
then O
when O
they O
changed O
it, O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
cold. O

We O
ordered O
a O
chocolate B-TARGET
curd, I-TARGET
a O
dish O
usually O
difficult O
to O
miss, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
curd O
and O
it O
didn't O
taste O
good. O

Very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
pleasant O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
cuisine! B-TARGET

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
fresh O
and O
seasonal, O
travel O
a O
regal! O

Jy O
will O
return O
a O
coup O
on O
to O
uncover O
the O
other O
plates O
on O
the O
card. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
improvised O
we O
will O
return O
there O
without O
worry! O

Very O
good O
map B-TARGET
with O
simple O
but O
sought O
after O
dishes. O

The O
servers B-TARGET
are O
really O
very O
nice O
and O
welcoming. O

A O
delicacy O
in O
this O
neighbourhood O
or O
many O
restaurants O
are O
tourist O
traps. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it! O

I O
often O
come O
there O
at O
midday, O
excellent O
crafts B-TARGET
and O
very O
large O
choices. O

The O
galettes B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
and O
very O
affordable. O

Nice O
service. B-TARGET

There O
is O
nothing O
to O
be O
overlooked; O
price O
quality O
is O
just O
average, O
they O
are O
all O
like O
this O
on O
the O
street. O

limited O
cleanliness, O
toilets O
to O
be O
avoided. O

do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
make O
a O
few O
hundred O
extra O
meters. O

Very O
good O
reception, B-TARGET
complete O
brewery O
map, B-TARGET
good O
price O
quality O
ratio, O
pleasant O
setting. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
and O
efficient O
service, B-TARGET
we O
were O
served O
in O
less O
than O
10min O
on O
a O
Friday O
evening O
at O
20h. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

Obviously O
this O
is O
not O
a O
gastronomic O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
ask! O

Simple O
but O
good O
products B-TARGET
(meat O
eggs, O
roasted O
tomatoes O
and O
bacon), O
then O
successful O
homemade O
cheesecake. B-TARGET

The O
bemol O
was O
the O
wait B-TARGET
and O
the O
friendly O
servers B-TARGET
but O
a O
bit O
overstated O

The O
location O
was O
very O
good, O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

The B-TARGET
staff O
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

I O
tend O
to O
have O
priorities O
on O
meals B-TARGET
in O
breweries O
but O
we O
were O
satisfied O
with O
that. O

Freeze-dried O
kitchen, B-TARGET
poor O
quality. O

Poor O
cooking O
of O
food. B-TARGET

There O
is O
no O
responsibility O
in O
the O
restaurant O
to O
respond O
to O
our O
requests. O

However, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O

I O
loved O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Small O
and O
warm, O
we O
ate O
super O
well! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone! O

We O
stopped O
by O
chance O
in O
front O
of O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
does O
not O
pay O
a O
mine O
outside. O

What O
a O
surprise! O

Very O
good, O
fresh, O
nicely O
presented O
products. B-TARGET

The O
whole O
thing O
was O
original O
without O
being O
pretentious, O
for O
a O
very O
correct O
sum. O

The O
prices O
are O
above O
the O
Parisian O
average O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
same O
banal O
service. O

The O
significant O
bemol O
as O
others O
confirmed O
above O
in O
the O
comments: O
the O
hospitality B-TARGET
and O
service....PAS B-TARGET
UN O
SOURIRE. O

..rien. O

.. O
served O
with O
a O
stone O
lance! O

Not O
a O
thank O
you... O
what O
sadness. O

So O
in O
case O
of O
absolute O
necessity O
only O
for O
survival O
or O
else O
look O
in O
the O
immediate O
approaches. O

To O
meet O
much O
more O
sympathetic O
people. O

A O
catastrophe O
that O
must O
be O
avoided. O

We O
went O
there O
before O
a O
show, O
the O
servers B-TARGET
are O
overloaded O
and O
unpleasant, O
a O
real O
Parisian O
cliché! O

A O
server B-TARGET
who O
had O
served O
the O
order O
twice O
at O
a O
neighbouring O
table O
just O
cried O
out O
at O
his O
customers. O

For O
us, O
our O
passage O
through O
the O
toilets O
was O
memorable, O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting O
( O
giant O
hall, O
4 O
toilets O
for O
everyone, O
well O
played), O
a O
nasty O
smell O
and O
frankly O
cleanliness O
beyond O
limit. O

Then, O
coming O
back O
into O
the O
room, O
an O
energetic O
server B-TARGET
hears O
us O
say O
"there O
are O
no O
towels O
to O
wash O
your O
hands O
down" O
and O
gives O
a O
pat O
to O
my O
husband, O
who O
doesn't O
want O
to O
lie O
all O
the O
way O
on O
the O
ground. O

An O
unnecessary O
assault O
that O
ruined O
the O
evening. O

In O
short, O
we O
will O
never O
return O
there. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
setting! B-TARGET

But O
especially O
fresh O
products, B-TARGET
finally O
real O
fries B-TARGET
that O
don't O
bathe O
in O
oil, O
the O
fraiche O
salad B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
little O
dessert!! B-TARGET

To O
recommend. O

Personally O
I O
had O
taken O
the O
tournedos O
at O
16 O
euros. O

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money! O

The O
only O
good O
point O
is O
the O
very O
nice O
setting. B-TARGET

Even O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
winter O
we O
could O
eat O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
thanks O
to O
the O
outdoor O
heating. O

Otherwise O
it's O
simple O
everything O
that's O
not O
prepared O
is O
good, O
the O
rest O
without O
flavor. O

Too O
sweet O
cocktail B-TARGET
vs O
good O
wine. B-TARGET

Cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
charcuterie I-TARGET
very O
good O
vs O
Bruchetas B-TARGET
and O
pasta B-TARGET
without O
taste. O

But O
most O
of O
all O
our O
meals O
arrived O
before O
the O
entrance, O
so O
we O
reported O
that O
we O
had O
not O
had O
the O
entrance. O

So O
our O
entrances O
arrived O
then O
our O
dishes O
after O
a O
very O
long O
wait B-TARGET
when O
it O
was O
the O
seats O
arrived O
too O
early O
that O
they O
had O
warmed O
up... O
Cold O
pasta B-TARGET
on O
top O
and O
smoke O
underneath O
= O
microwave. O

A O
bread B-TARGET
that O
sucks O
water O
= O
micro O
wave. O

So O
they O
did O
not O
take O
the O
trouble O
to O
rebuild O
our O
foundations. O

In O
short, O
the O
prepared B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
not O
good O
and O
they O
make O
fun O
of O
customers. O

A B-TARGET
very O
nice O
kitchen O
in O
a O
"good O
chic O
good O
genre" O
setting. B-TARGET

The O
wines B-TARGET
are O
very O
expensive. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
hotel O
was O
disrespectful O
and O
gross. O

Absolutely O
flee! O

We O
went O
there O
last O
night O
and O
we O
were O
more O
than O
disappointed. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
poor, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
poor O
and O
the O
note O
very O
salty! O

Avoid O
it O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
urgency! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
settle O
for O
dessert, O
don't O
hesitate O
to O
push O
the O
door O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
table O
on O
the O
floor. O

For O
lovers O
of O
dessert O
it O
is O
important O
to O
take O
the O
thousand B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
fruit I-TARGET
streams. I-TARGET

You O
cannot O
remove O
the O
chair O
because O
it O
is O
not O
done, O
but O
you O
are O
very O
sorry O
that O
your O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
finished. O

Don't O
rely O
on O
the O
empty O
entrance, O
everything O
is O
on O
the O
floor. O

Nice O
déco, B-TARGET
low O
lighting, B-TARGET
relaxed O
welcome. B-TARGET

We O
tested O
the O
tasting O
menu O
at O
70€. O

It O
includes O
8 O
surprise O
dishes O
and O
a O
snack O
bar. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast. O

The O
small O
quantities O
of O
the O
entrances B-TARGET
are O
frustrating, O
because O
the O
flavors O
are O
excellent O
but O
they O
are O
well O
dosed O
to O
reach O
the O
dessert. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
seasonal. O

The O
chef O
masters O
the O
mixture O
of O
tastes O
and O
textures. O

There O
may O
be O
a O
lack O
of O
originality, O
but O
you O
can O
still O
settle O
for O
it. O

A O
good O
French B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
in O
this O
restaurant, O
a O
very O
warm O
place, B-TARGET
a O
good O
service B-TARGET
to O
ask O
for O
more? O

I O
would O
return O
with O
great O
pleasure O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Parisian B-TARGET
brasserie I-TARGET
of O
the O
neighbourhood O
neither O
more O
nor O
less. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. B-TARGET

There O
is O
nothing O
negative O
to O
say O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
not O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary. O

We O
were O
there O
on O
a O
Saturday O
evening. O

Deco B-TARGET
not O
bad, O
music B-TARGET
for O
30/40 O
years O
pretty O
nice. O

Good O
cocktails B-TARGET
and O
very O
nice O
barman. B-TARGET

Very O
classic O
dishes, B-TARGET
and O
poor O
quality O
dishes. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there O
except O
for O
a O
drink O
I O
think. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located, O
close O
to O
the O
Sacré B-TARGET
Coeur. I-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
capricioza I-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
not O
exceptional. O

For O
the O
salad, B-TARGET
my O
friend O
had O
taken O
a O
salad, O
the O
price O
was O
a O
bit O
high O
for O
a O
green O
salad O
and O
2 O
slices O
of O
ham O
under O
empty. O

Nice O
place! B-TARGET

Entrées B-TARGET
a O
share: O
very O
good! O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
places: B-TARGET
attention! O

ridiculous O
portions! B-TARGET

And O
so O
super O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is! O

And O
tastes, O
not O
at O
all O
worth O
the O
price! O

Excellent O
cuisine! B-TARGET

How O
can O
we O
say O
home O
cooking O
with O
these O
asperges B-TARGET
in O
a O
bowl, O
its O
beef B-TARGET
bourguignon I-TARGET
filled O
with O
low O
pieces..... O
these O
frozen O
scargots B-TARGET
etc... O
French O
cuisine O
really? O

The O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room B-TARGET
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

It O
must O
be O
absolutely O
banned. O

It O
was O
not O
bad O
but O
despite O
their O
originality O
and O
their O
nice O
presentation, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
by O
the O
dishes: B-TARGET
artichokes B-TARGET
in O
boxes O
(the O
boxes O
are O
downstairs...), O
meat B-TARGET
a O
little O
too O
cooked, O
expensive O
wines. B-TARGET

Nevertheless, O
the O
good O
manners O
of O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
and O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
slightly O
catch O
up O
with O
this O
mixed O
message. O

This O
is O
done O
several O
times O
and O
we O
are O
never O
disappointed, O
nor O
are O
the O
relatives O
who O
are O
brought O
there. O

Their O
couscous B-TARGET
is O
really O
excellent. O

The O
balls B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
the O
lamb B-TARGET
sticks I-TARGET
are O
also O
delicious. O

Two O
kinds O
of O
mixtures O
of O
vegetables O
are O
offered O
as O
an O
accompaniment. O

The B-TARGET
chief's I-TARGET
suggestion I-TARGET
changes O
regularly O
and O
the O
latest O
one, O
couscous B-TARGET
méchoui, I-TARGET
is O
particularly O
good. O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
comfortable O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful. O

Try O
it O
out O
and O
come O
with O
a O
very O
very O
hungry! O

The O
tapas B-TARGET
are O
excellent...The O
carnival B-TARGET
is O
also O
of O
good O
quality. O

Everything O
made O
us O
want O
to... O
laugh O
to O
say! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

Nice O
little O
address! B-TARGET

No O
brewery O
or O
restaurant. O

A O
simple O
neighbourhood O
cafe B-TARGET
that O
improvises O
as O
a O
restaurant. O

Insipid O
salads B-TARGET
and O
hot O
(bad) O
dishes. B-TARGET

Wine B-TARGET
map O
does O
not O
exist. O

Industrial O
desserts. B-TARGET

There O
is O
a O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
improvised, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
competence O
at O
the O
reception B-TARGET
level, O
at O
the O
service B-TARGET
level, O
or O
at O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
level O
(frozen O
food). B-TARGET

Sound O
ambience B-TARGET
much O
too O
high O
for O
a O
restaurant. O

To O
their O
credit, O
there O
is O
no O
desire O
to O
renew O
the O
experience. O

The O
worst O
culinary O
experience O
in O
Paris, O
with O
an O
astronomical O
addition: O
lobster B-TARGET
raviolis I-TARGET
at O
20 O
euros O
(the O
raviolis O
had O
to O
have O
at O
least O
3 O
days) O
then O
back B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cod I-TARGET
not O
cooked O
on O
potato B-TARGET
slices, O
accompanied O
by O
rocket B-TARGET
not O
fraiche O
at O
47 O
euros. O

We O
did O
not O
eat O
dessert. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
horrible. O

to O
prohibit! O

The B-TARGET
hotel I-TARGET
is O
very O
cold, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
antipathic O
and O
aggressive. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
she O
was O
being O
diverted O
by O
asking O
for O
mayonnaise O
or O
mustard. O

The O
cooked B-TARGET
rumsteack I-TARGET
pave O
was O
too O
cold, O
a O
horse O
was O
found O
in O
a O
hamburger, O
which O
didn't O
seem O
to O
shock O
them. O

The O
rosé B-TARGET
was O
genuine. O

We O
will O
not O
go O
back O
and O
advertise O
to O
them O

Clearly O
this O
restaurant O
preferred O
everything O
to O
the O
background B-TARGET
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
the O
cuisine! B-TARGET

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful. O

Sure O
to O
avoid. O

Ah! O

I O
forgot: O
if O
you O
find O
your O
cheeseburger B-TARGET
at O
14.50€ O
too O
dry, O
you O
are O
told O
that O
you O
could O
have O
added O
a O
salad O
sheet O
or O
a O
cornichon... O
charged O
0.50€! O

All O
is O
said O
and O
done. O

Rideau. O

A O
crooked B-TARGET
gentleman I-TARGET
without O
fries O
with O
sausage O
salad, B-TARGET
avoiding O
any O
flavor... O

I'm O
not O
talking O
about O
the O
price... O

We O
found O
a O
chewing O
gum O
glued O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
our O
glass O
of O
water, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
didn't O
apologize O
and O
put O
the O
mistake O
on O
the O
dishwasher... O
we O
didn't O
even O
offer O
us O
a O
commercial O
gesture O
we O
have O
to O
ask O
the O
manager O
who O
can O
only O
offer O
us O
a O
coffee O
(but O
we O
don't O
drink O
coffee...). O

Once O
again O
this O
restaurant O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
typical O
Parisian O
tourist O
brewery O
that O
buys O
its O
products B-TARGET
of O
low O
quality O
at O
"métro"and O
makes O
you O
pay O
a O
blindfold O
for O
them! O

Poor O
tourist! O

We O
went O
there O
for O
lunch. O

Quick O
and O
courteous O
welcome. B-TARGET

The O
dishes, B-TARGET
well O
presented, O
colorful O
and O
spicy, O
were O
copied O
and O
tasty. O

Original O
and O
light O
desserts. B-TARGET

We O
did O
not O
drink O
wine, O
so O
I O
have O
no O
opinion O
on O
the O
matter. O

At O
a O
time O
when O
the O
Marais O
is O
transforming, O
changing O
face O
and O
not O
necessarily O
in O
the O
best O
sense O
of O
the O
word, O
a O
real O
discovery O
tonight!! O
I O
confirm O
that O
for O
many O
years O
I O
have O
not O
eaten O
as O
well O
in O
this O
neighbourhood O
as O
tonight! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
this O
rich O
modern O
and O
tasty O
cuisine, B-TARGET
thank O
you O
also O
for O
the O
hospitality B-TARGET
at O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
kindness O
and O
professionalism O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
thank O
you O
and O
thank O
you O
again O

Of O
course, O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
paid O
for, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
a O
reason. O

The O
choucroute, B-TARGET
the O
light O
product, O
is O
acidic O
and O
is O
eaten O
without O
real O
pleasure... O
it O
is O
a O
pity O
with O
such O
a O
potential O
not O
to O
do O
better. O

Good O
and O
fast O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
missing O
a O
lot. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
did O
not O
take O
care O
of O
the O
whole O
dinner, O
she O
served O
us O
the O
first O
dish O
before O
drinks, O
we O
asked O
for O
covers O
and O
bread O
three O
times. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

It O
is O
the O
perfect O
place B-TARGET
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
forgotten O
and O
ignored! O

It O
is O
not O
recommended O
at O
all!!!! O

In O
this O
quiet O
neighbourhood, B-TARGET
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
dine O
outside O
under O
the O
arcades O
while O
tasting O
very O
good O
seasonal O
cuisine. B-TARGET

A O
friendly O
reception B-TARGET
and O
good O
advice O
on O
wine O
choices. O

Also, O
a O
good O
quality/price O
ratio O
for O
this O
Parisian O
restaurant. B-TARGET

To O
recommend. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room B-TARGET
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

Excellent O
dinner, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
waiter, B-TARGET
and O
tamed O
atmosphere.. B-TARGET
We O
tested O
several O
entrances O
and O
dishes.. O
No O
one O
was O
disappointed. O

To O
advise! O

A O
warm O
address, B-TARGET
with O
a O
cosy O
and O
pleasant O
setting. B-TARGET

Excellent O
tapas, B-TARGET
tasted O
with O
delicious O
cocktails, B-TARGET
and O
at O
least O
original! O

Nice O
place, B-TARGET
that's O
what O
is O
sold. O

But O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
service B-TARGET
and O
organization, O
it's O
always O
improvisation. O

Too O
long O
wait B-TARGET
times I-TARGET
and O
obvious O
lack O
of O
organization. O

Apart O
from O
its O
situation B-TARGET
and O
its O
framework, B-TARGET
really O
nothing O
exceptional O
for O
this O
"cantin"! O

Unsweetened O
dishes B-TARGET
at O
exorbitant O
prices! O

It O
is O
always O
said O
that O
you O
have O
the O
price O
posters O
on O
the O
map, B-TARGET
we O
should O
at O
least O
eat O
well. O

And O
well O
NO, O
go O
your O
way O
and O
don't O
get O
into O
the O
pumpkin, B-TARGET
it's O
the O
arcade! O

Deception O
at O
the O
time O
of O
tasting O
the O
thick O
and O
bubbly O
tab, B-TARGET
my O
husband's O
pork B-TARGET
liver I-TARGET
looked O
the O
same O
as O
my O
plate, O
even O
brown B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
scallops... I-TARGET
frankly O
nothing O
exceptional! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room O
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

This O
address B-TARGET
has O
been O
very O
good O
for O
several O
years. O

But O
that O
was O
before. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
less O
complete, O
some O
particularly O
delicious O
and O
original O
dishes O
have O
disappeared. O

The O
service B-TARGET
has O
deteriorated. O

More O
smiles, O
ice-cold O
welcome. B-TARGET

And O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
deteriorating, O
all O
this O
is O
less O
and O
less O
digestible. O

That O
is O
a O
pity. O

Here, O
no O
artifice. O

Fresh, O
well-scrambled O
and O
prepared O
products B-TARGET
with O
respect O
for O
French O
cuisine. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
attentive, O
patient, O
courteous O
and O
discreet... O

Bravo O

The O
terrines B-TARGET
and O
meat B-TARGET
are O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Beaujolais B-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

A O
simple O
but O
tasty O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
good O
products. B-TARGET

The O
echalotes B-TARGET
starter I-TARGET
with O
its O
cooked O
mushrooms O
is O
a O
delicacy. O

it's O
always O
a O
rule O
to O
go O
there. O

Very O
high O
prices O
for O
meals B-TARGET
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
table. O

I O
have O
eaten O
a O
raw O
and O
very O
dry O
chicken B-TARGET
for O
25 O
euros! O

A O
shame O

It O
is O
a O
good O
place O
to O
eat O
at O
all O
times O
and O
if O
you O
stick O
to O
the O
menus B-TARGET
it O
is O
right O
and O
at O
an O
acceptable O
price O
given O
the O
institutional O
nature O
of O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

On O
the O
map B-TARGET
it O
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
but O
the O
choice O
is O
wider. O

Nice O
hotel, B-TARGET
quick O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
classy O
setting, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
good O
memory O
of O
Paris O

Really O
delicious. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
in O
an O
original O
setting B-TARGET
where O
one O
feels O
well. O

A O
nice O
map B-TARGET
full O
of O
good O
surprises. O

This O
hotel B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

Excellent O
cuisine, B-TARGET
and O
truffles B-TARGET
are O
served O
at O
a O
very O
good O
price. O

In O
short, O
it O
is O
certainly O
one O
of O
the O
best O
Parisian O
bistros. O

Everything O
was O
perfect: O
the O
reception, B-TARGET
the O
setting, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(a O
pianist O
plays O
classic O
pieces O
between O
two O
"numeros O
of O
song"), O
the O
very O
fine O
meal, B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
songs! B-TARGET

It O
is O
magical O
to O
have O
talented O
artists O
singing O
from O
the O
opera O
right O
next O
to O
us! O

An O
excellent O
evening O
that O
is O
worth O
the O
price. O

I O
came O
to O
dinner O
in O
this O
restaurant O
with O
colleagues. O

I O
found O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
quite, O
moderate. O

My O
advisor's O
entry B-TARGET
was O
quite O
normal. O

The O
dish O
of O
St. B-TARGET
Jacques's I-TARGET
Coquilles I-TARGET
with O
pasta O
was O
correct. O

The O
dessert O
a O
fine B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
was O
very O
mediocre. O

The O
pie B-TARGET
was O
cold O
and O
not O
particularly O
fresh. O

The O
accompanying O
ice B-TARGET
was O
correct O
but O
only O
a O
small O
ball. O

We O
were O
almost O
the O
only O
guests O
during O
the O
evening. O

My O
colleagues O
were O
on O
average O
satisfied. O

My O
neighbour O
warmed O
up O
his O
cold O
stoves. B-TARGET

So O
do O
not O
select O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
gourmet O
meal B-TARGET
but O
to O
eat O
correctly O
without O
any O
more. O

We O
will O
never O
return O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
enjoyed O
several O
dishes B-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
without O
refinement. O

I O
don't O
see O
any O
or O
he O
can O
keep O
his O
reputation. O

So O
if O
you O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
to O
spend O
a O
nice O
time O
and O
eat O
good O
things O
AWAY. O

If O
you O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
to O
be O
seen O
it O
is O
the O
ideal O
place. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

The O
key O
word O
is O
authenticity. O

Here, O
French B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
celebrated. O

A O
character O
table B-TARGET
where O
you O
go O
when O
you O
appreciate O
the O
good O
things. O

We O
love O
the O
taste O
of O
justice. O

The O
friendly O
spirit O
we O
like. O

a O
bit O
noisy O
though O
given O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
tables. O

A O
real O
rule O
makes O
it O
hard. O

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money O
for O
this O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
very O
pleasant. O

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
the O
owner B-TARGET
and O
the O
server B-TARGET
are O
always O
smiling! O

We O
have O
tested O
many O
different O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
always O
excellent! O

Very O
honest O
price-quality O
ratio O
for O
this O
great O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Excellent. O

From O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
dessert O
through O
to O
a O
very O
nice O
selection O
of O
wine B-TARGET
maps. I-TARGET

All O
this O
for O
about O
thirty O
euros, O
and O
less O
than O
50€ O
with O
a O
drink, O
it's O
remarkable! O

Bravo O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
classic O
décor B-TARGET
will O
delight O
you. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
impeccable, O
diligent O
and O
discreet. O

I O
love O
these O
restaurants O
where O
we O
always O
have O
wine O
in O
our O
cut O
without O
ever O
having O
to O
touch O
the O
bottle, O
for O
me O
it O
is O
proof O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
always O
keeps O
an O
eye O
on O
you O
to O
serve O
you. O

The O
synchronization B-TARGET
(time O
to O
serve O
the O
different O
dishes) O
was O
perfectly O
correct. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

A O
little O
more O
vegetables O
in O
the O
portions O
would O
be O
appreciated O
for O
our O
taste. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
was O
adequate, O
but O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
served O
too O
hot. O

Great O
breakfast! B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

Everything O
is O
refined, O
fragrant, O
aesthetic, O
surprising! O

Great O
happiness! O

A O
lot O
of O
kindness, O
full O
of O
flavors! O

What O
else? O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
from O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
dessert. O

This O
saves O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
waiting B-TARGET
time O
for O
a O
seat. O

There O
is O
no O
possibility O
of O
booking O
in O
the O
evening, O
so O
it O
is O
on O
a O
waiting O
list O
which, O
it O
seems O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
week O
can O
be O
very O
long. O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
friendly. O

Closed O
restaurant. B-TARGET

That O
is O
a O
good O
sign. O

A O
good O
Parisian O
table O
is O
confirmed. O

Apéro B-TARGET
house O
advised. O

Just O
a O
little O
disappointed O
with O
the O
setting O
up. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
lack O
of O
cooking O
for O
fatty B-TARGET
liver. O

Do B-TARGET
not I-TARGET
leave I-TARGET
bad O
but O
too O
rusty. O

The O
perfect O
wine. B-TARGET

Friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Charming O
brewery O
atmosphere B-TARGET
with O
a O
very O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
typical O
French O
and O
seasonal O
dishes B-TARGET
but O
prepared O
in O
a O
slightly O
too O
"industrial" O
way: O
For O
example, O
the O
7 O
hour O
gibgot B-TARGET
served O
in O
cocotte O
is O
boiled!!! O

It O
will O
be O
simple: O

Most: O

- O
Product B-TARGET
sourcing O
is O
top O

- O
it O
is O
good, O
controlled O
and O
sometimes O
original O

- O
Formula B-TARGET
midday O
TOP O

At O
least: O

- O
unpleasant, O
boring O
and O
arrogant O
patron B-TARGET

- O
it O
is O
often O
expensive O

- O
"bio" O
"natural" O
wines B-TARGET
often O
expensive O
and O
delicious O

Conclusion: O

What O
to O
do O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
corner, O
but O
not O
the O
trouble O
to O
hurry O
there, O
very O
good O
bistros O
is O
not O
what O
is O
missing O
in O
Paris. O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
were I-TARGET
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

It O
doesn't O
accept O
restaurants O
tickets O
or O
American O
Express O
cards... O
and O
tells O
you O
that O
without O
hesitation. O

I'm O
sorry, O
but O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
for O
dinner O
with O
friends. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
good, O
for O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
it O
is O
another O
thing... O

A O
dorade B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chorizo, I-TARGET
without O
chorizo. O

Instead, O
a O
kind O
of O
tomato B-TARGET
confit I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lemon I-TARGET
is O
simply O
delicious. O

And O
when O
the O
boss O
is O
asked O
to O
come O
and O
taste O
and O
it's O
actually O
not O
good O
and O
she'll O
ask O
in O
the O
kitchen O
the O
problem. O

And O
well, O
too O
much O
lemon O
juice O
but O
no O
commercial O
gesture. O

The O
so-called O
"purée" B-TARGET
home O
is O
made O
of O
mousseline, O
and O
I O
am O
not O
talking O
about O
other O
vegetables B-TARGET
that O
are O
boiled O
and O
tasteless. O

I O
also O
find O
it O
regrettable O
that O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
arrived O
cold... O

The O
carpaccio B-TARGET
of O
tomatoes O
in O
the O
entrance O
was O
good. O

The O
dessert, O
a O
soup B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
basil I-TARGET
fries I-TARGET
was O
correct. O

In O
short, O
for O
two O
people O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
rosé: O
86€ O
for O
cold O
dishes, B-TARGET
without O
flavours, O
and O
which O
do O
not O
match O
what O
is O
written O
on O
the O
map. O

This O
is O
accompanied O
by O
the O
bad O
faith O
of O
the O
management... B-TARGET

Despite O
a O
nice O
terrace, B-TARGET
I O
will O
never O
put O
my O
foot O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
again... O

A O
friendly O
team, B-TARGET
genuine O
traditional B-TARGET
French I-TARGET
food, I-TARGET
freshness O
of O
food, B-TARGET
inventiveness O
(chicken B-TARGET
feet I-TARGET
to O
test O
:)) O
in O
recipes, O
good O
small O
wines, B-TARGET
frankly, O
it O
makes O
4 O
times O
I O
go O
there, O
and O
I O
am O
always O
delighted! O

Two O
steps O
away O
from O
the O
Pantheon, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
it O
will O
be O
touristic, O
but O
not: O
a O
pretty O
intimate, O
retro O
decor, B-TARGET
with O
large O
mirrors, O
the O
map O
on O
an O
old O
fireplace, O
the O
tables O
in O
beautiful O
wood... O

A O
very O
good O
address! B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
the O
formula B-TARGET
at O
16.50 O
€. O

We O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
highlight O
of O
this O
warm O
bistro B-TARGET
is O
its O
cuisine. B-TARGET

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
served O
in O
sufficient O
quantities O
and O
are O
very O
hot. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
at O
26 O
euros O
for O
entry/breakfast/ O
dessert O
offers O
a O
very O
satisfactory O
quality/price O
ratio. O

The O
negative O
points O
are O
the O
lack O
of O
space O
(the O
tables O
are O
small O
and O
very O
close), O
the O
rather O
noisy O
environment B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
time O
before O
service O
(about O
45 O
minutes O
before O
the O
entrance). O

Nevertheless, O
I O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
return O
and O
invite O
you O
to O
discover O
this O
place. B-TARGET

I O
went O
to O
lunch O
in O
this O
restaurant O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
December. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
but O
the O
prices O
were O
too O
high O
even O
for O
the O
neighborhood. O

The O
patronage B-TARGET
is O
non-existent, O
even O
involuntary, O
and O
unpleasant O
with O
clients. O

Very O
long O
wait B-TARGET
times I-TARGET
and O
bad O
service B-TARGET
which O
spoils O
a O
bit O
the O
evening. O

Too O
many O
tables O
for O
the O
surface, O
the O
customers O
are O
overwhelmed. O

Good O
food. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
with O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
finally O
the O
"homemade". O

A B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
and O
cheerful O
servant. O

The O
room O
was O
very O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O
The O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
the O
small O
beast, O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait B-TARGET
a O
bit. O

We O
will O
come O
back. O

My O
best O
place O
to O
stay B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Thailand! O

On O
my O
menu: O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

Fine, O
fragrant, O
with O
coconut O
milk O
in O
parsimony, O
exquisitely O
spiced. O

Welcome: B-TARGET
top O
of O
the O
list! O

The O
alliance O
of O
Asian O
warmth O
and O
all O
the O
delicacy O
of O
service B-TARGET
to O
the O
West. O

Waiting B-TARGET
is O
not O
longer O
than O
elsewhere. O

We O
feel O
guided O
in O
our O
menu O
choices. O

My O
portfolio: O
perfectly O
reasonable. O

We O
paid O
56€ O
for O
3 O
entrances, O
2 O
meals O
and O
accompaniments O
and O
2 O
desserts. O

It's O
been O
years O
since O
I O
made O
my O
qg O
there O
and O
the O
guests O
I O
brought O
made O
it O
their O
own. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
of O
poor O
quality, O
certainly O
cooked O
several O
times, O
hygiene O
desirable... O

The O
servers B-TARGET
are O
hard O
to O
understand O
and O
especially O
unfriendly! O

Finally, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
cannot O
be O
said O
to O
be O
pleasant. O

In O
short, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
to O
be O
avoided. O

Sympathic O
neighbourhood O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
very O
Parisian O
setting B-TARGET
with O
all O
these O
posters O
on O
the O
walls. O

We O
are O
a O
bit O
tight O
but O
your O
neighbours O
are O
always O
pleasant O
and O
some O
have O
what O
we O
call O
a O
head. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

There O
is O
no O
gastronomy O
of O
course O
but O
kitchen B-TARGET
of O
the O
land. O
We O
come O
here O
to O
spend O
a O
good O
time O
with O
friends O
without O
ruining O
ourselves O
and O
we O
come O
back O
there O
with O
pleasure. O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
stay. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
friendly O
and O
everything O
was O
very O
well O
organized, O
there O
was O
no O
pressure O
at O
all, O
on O
the O
contrary O
they O
were O
all O
very O
cool O
despite O
the O
tons O
of O
food O
they O
had O
to O
serve! O

The O
stream O
passed O
with O
us O
very O
well O
and O
yet O
we O
were O
a O
big O
crowd O
of O
12 O
very O
active O
people! O

Some O
people O
saw O
their O
lamb B-TARGET
mice I-TARGET
not O
well O
cooked O
so O
2 O
bottles O
of O
red O
were O
offered O
to O
us O
in O
compensation. O

I O
took O
a O
filet B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
carrots, I-TARGET
it O
was O
quite O
delicious O
and O
tasty O
as O
needed, O
perfect. O

Home O
fries B-TARGET
are O
also O
a O
rule. O

So O
I O
recommend O
you O
to O
eat O
mojito, B-TARGET
a O
big O
glass O
for O
5 O
euros, O
super O
good. O

We O
came O
on O
a O
Saturday O
evening, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
full, O
even O
on O
the O
terrace, O
so O
advice: O
reserve O
in O
advance! O

For O
most O
of O
us, O
we O
found O
our O
QG O
from O
the O
Seine O
Bay! O

A O
welcoming O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
chef B-TARGET
and O
his B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
welcoming. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
relaxing O
and O
cosy O
at O
the O
same O
time... O

If O
I O
had O
lived O
in O
the O
neighbourhood, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
a O
good O
chance O
that O
I O
would O
have O
made O
my O
canteen O
in O
the O
evening. O

A O
bistro O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
very O
careful, O
some O
traditional B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
excellently O
revisited. O

The O
pot B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
fire I-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the O
game O
of O
beef O
is O
to O
fall O
on O
the O
ground! O

Beautiful O
in O
the O
palace, O
they O
are O
also O
very O
pleasant O
in O
the O
view. O

Well O
done! O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
dirty, O
the O
industrial O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
poor O
quality, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
unfriendly, O
nothing O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
acceptable. O

To O
flee. O

We O
went, O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
friends, O
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
warm, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice. O

The O
couscous B-TARGET
and O
tajines B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
accompanied O
by O
a O
good O
Moroccan B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
with O
the O
sympathy O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
and O
mint O
tea, B-TARGET
a O
very O
pleasant O
evening. O

A O
correct O
price O
quality O
ratio. O

We O
went O
there O
on O
May O
14th O
together O
with O
our O
son. O

Good O
kitchen B-TARGET
but O
nothing O
extraordinary, O
lotte, O
pintade... O

A O
children's B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
with O
only O
one O
choice O
of O
dishes O
and O
not O
possible O
to O
have O
anything O
else, O
we O
had O
to O
order O
the O
pintade B-TARGET
much O
too O
copieus O
for O
an O
8-year-old O
child O
who O
nou O
its O
been O
counted O
in O
adult O
dish O
at O
25 O
euros! O

A O
very O
expensive O
poultry! B-TARGET

In O
short O
140 O
euros O
to O
3 O
with O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine O
and O
a O
lemonade, O
it's O
too O
much O
for O
a O
very O
simple O
lunch. B-TARGET

Average O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
whose, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
profession. O

The O
British O
boss B-TARGET
is O
nice O
to O
him! O

Very O
friendly, O
it's O
more O
than O
a O
restaurant, O
we O
feel O
family. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

Despite O
the O
goodwill O
of O
the O
maid, B-TARGET
we O
feel O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
rather O
unorganized. O

In O
fact, O
between O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
arrive O
late O
and O
those O
that O
are O
not O
cooked O
as O
requested, O
it O
is O
a O
little O
annoying. O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

To O
improve O
so O
that O
it O
becomes O
a O
real O
good O
address! B-TARGET

We O
used O
to O
visit O
this O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
a O
lot, O
but O
there O
it O
fell O
a O
lot... O

We O
get O
back O
with O
a O
wolf O
hunger O
because O
the O
seats B-TARGET
are O
tiny, O
and O
the O
addition..., O
very O
salty... O

The O
food O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
there O
is O
so O
much O
better O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
as O
Thai O
restaurant! O

Avoid O
holding O
money O
at O
your O
door...! O

It's O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
indeed, O
and O
that's O
all O
I O
can O
say O
positively. O

A O
service B-TARGET
that O
doesn't O
exist O
and O
is O
totally O
out O
of O
order; O
a O
boss B-TARGET
who O
spends O
more O
time O
talking O
to O
his O
friends O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
restaurant O
than O
doing O
his O
job. O

An O
atmosphere B-TARGET
that O
wants O
to O
be O
bobo O
/ O
Parisian O
but O
then O
plutot O
on O
the O
decline O
seen O
the O
panel O
(age) O
of O
the O
room. O

As O
for O
food, B-TARGET
it O
is O
horrible. O

To O
avoid O
absolutely. O

An O
excellent O
meal B-TARGET
mixing O
American O
flavors O
and O
French O
knowledge O
from O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
dessert. O

We O
were O
5 O
and O
enjoyed O
2 O
entrances, B-TARGET
5 O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
4 O
desserts, B-TARGET
all O
excellent O
and O
very O
well O
prepared, O
especially O
entrances. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
warm O
and O
original O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
without O
false O
notes O
and O
friendly O
is O
rather O
faster.The O
selection O
of O
wines B-TARGET
is O
in O
line O
with O
the O
map O
and O
the O
price O
with O
yours O
;). O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

Our O
choice, O
duck B-TARGET
magret, I-TARGET
delicious, O
chicken, B-TARGET
excellent O
and O
lamb B-TARGET
ribs I-TARGET
to O
lay O
down O
babies. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
not O
left, O
choco O
boat, O
lost O
bread O
and O
delicious O
coffee. O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

We'll O
be O
back O
there!! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

A O
good O
value O
for O
money O
for O
the O
neighbourhood. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
were O
frankly O
nothing O
exceptional: O
vegetables B-TARGET
not O
cooked O
enough, O
a O
lamb B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
served O
in O
large O
portions, O
without O
any O
fineness. O

Good O
choice O
of O
wines. B-TARGET

Romantic O
ballad O
after O
the O
meal O
is O
necessary. O

At O
2 O
pm, O
an O
aperitif O
turns O
into O
dinner. O

Small O
summer O
salad, B-TARGET
simple O
fresh O
and O
not O
expensive. O

Tiramisu B-TARGET
has I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
effective O
straw O
at O
the O
end O
of O
dinner. O

Nice O
service, B-TARGET
very O
young O
team. O

one O
of O
the O
servers B-TARGET
has O
the O
physique O
of O
a O
15-year-old O
;) O
but O
very O
dynamic O
and O
nice. O

I O
was O
often O
there O
a O
few O
years O
ago, O
summer O
on O
large O
terrace B-TARGET
tables O
to O
share O
super O
moments O
with O
my O
family. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
I O
have O
not O
succeeded O
in O
regaining O
this O
spirit O
tonight. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
of O
course O
very O
famous O
but O
then O
a O
long O
time O
ago... O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
remained O
as O
before O
and O
it O
has O
its O
charm. O

But O
in O
the O
basement O
no O
kitchen, B-TARGET
industrial O
heating O
as O
in O
the O
business O
restaurant! O

A O
nice O
server B-TARGET
but O
that's O
the O
only O
positive O
thing. O

So O
go O
to O
a O
brewery, O
you O
will O
be O
less O
disappointed. O

Very O
reasonable, O
cool O
prices, O
a O
more O
than O
average O
reception. B-TARGET

And O
especially O
when O
a O
server B-TARGET
goes O
on O
your O
business O
and O
breaks O
something, O
no O
excuse, O
you O
get O
the O
note O
very O
quickly... O

And O
when O
we O
ask O
for O
at O
least O
forgiveness, O
we O
scratch O
our O
teeth O
and O
we O
are O
"gently" O
asked O
not O
to O
come O
back O
(to O
make O
it O
short). O

I'm O
sure O
I O
wouldn't O
put O
my O
feet O
back O
on O
it O
any O
more!! O

It O
is O
a O
shame! O

Even O
if O
we O
look O
hard O
we O
still O
don't O
find O
any O
positive O
points O
on O
this O
meal! O

Very O
slow O
and O
unorganized O
service, B-TARGET
frozen O
and O
bad O
cuisine, B-TARGET
plain O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
a O
child O
can O
prepare O
and O
which O
do O
not O
put O
in O
appetite... O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. B-TARGET

0 O
on O
the O
whole O
line. O

Never O
again O
this O
tourist O
attraction O

I O
would O
not O
advise O
this O
institution. B-TARGET

I O
took O
a O
knife O
cut O
turtle B-TARGET
but O
the O
beef B-TARGET
was O
of O
very O
poor O
quality, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
very O
fibrous O
and O
hard O
and O
therefore O
the O
dish B-TARGET
had O
no O
taste. O

I O
love O
the O
tartare, B-TARGET
I O
didn't O
even O
eat O
3/4 O
of O
it. O

It O
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
bad. O

A O
friend O
recommended O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
us, O
and O
he O
was O
right. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
just O
wonderful, O
you O
can O
even O
leave O
with O
small O
pots O
or O
ingredients O
used O
by O
the O
restaurant O
that O
are O
sold O
out. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

I O
strongly O
advise O
him. O

Unfortunately O
I O
had O
not O
consulted O
the O
advisories O
before O
deciding O
on O
our O
dinner O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
what O
mistake! O

That O
makes O
me O
very O
unhappy O
with O
this O
opinion, O
despite O
my O
conciliatory O
nature. O

We O
select O
the O
menu O
at O
39€ O

The O
included O
appetizer O
was O
not O
served O
to O
us O
and O
the O
entrances O
were O
rushed O
up O
to O
there O
nothing O
too O
serious... O
right O
liver B-TARGET
and O
salmon B-TARGET
then O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
to O
have O
the O
dishes: O
a O
turtle O
and O
a O
pepper O
steak O
the O
meat B-TARGET
had O
to O
be O
of O
the O
right O
quality O
sensed O
to O
be O
a O
selection O
Hugo O
Desnoyer O
(maybe O
the O
idea O
to O
let O
maltreat O
so O
his O
products) O
but O
if O
the O
turtle B-TARGET
is O
edible O
despite O
the O
low O
seasoning O
the O
steak B-TARGET
is O
cooked O
to O
him O
dry O
and O
charcoal O
seed O
but O
actually O
heartwarming, O
an O
exploit O
and O
the O
oil O
used O
for O
the O
fries B-TARGET
did O
not O
have O
to O
be O
filtered O
so O
they O
are O
rather O
good O
but O
grey... O

Once O
again O
30 O
to O
40 O
mn O
wait B-TARGET
for O
desserts B-TARGET
that O
are O
not O
edible O
and O
returned O
to O
the O
2nd O
bouchée O
fine B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
too O
cold O
apples O
and O
vanilla B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
cream O
arrived O
half O
melted O
and O
for O
my O
husband O
cardboard O
pancakes... B-TARGET

Errors O
are O
multiplying O
on O
3 O
nearby O
client O
tables... O

Pass O
quickly O
on O
the O
water O
carafe O
arriving O
at O
half-meal O
and O
the O
wine O
never O
served O
the O
music B-TARGET
rave O
way O
not O
adapted O
and O
to O
finish O
a O
gesture O
on O
the O
addition O
to O
make O
us O
more O
indulgent? O

The O
friendly O
environment B-TARGET
and O
a O
bit O
of O
professionalism O
could O
bring O
the O
bar O
up, O
but O
at O
the O
moment O
the O
price-quality O
ratio O
is O
really O
overwhelming. O

Go O
your O
way! O

From O
worse O
to O
worse... O
this O
pancake B-TARGET
shop I-TARGET
that O
we O
have O
been O
close O
to O
for O
almost O
10 O
years O
has O
gained O
in O
decoration B-TARGET
as O
much O
as O
it O
has O
lost O
in O
taste O
and O
quality O
in O
the O
dishes... B-TARGET

Crêpes B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
galettes I-TARGET
that O
arrive O
2min30 O
after O
ordering...very O
dry...no O
flavors O
and O
especially O
an O
evening O
of O
stomach O
crunches O
for O
the O
4 O
people O
around O
the O
table, O
just O
20min O
after O
dinner!!! O

We O
regret O
the O
good O
pancake B-TARGET
shop O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
will O
not O
return O
there O
again! O

Despite O
a O
sunny O
and O
green O
terrace B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
on O
beautiful O
days... O

Village O
restaurant. O

Good O
reception B-TARGET
but O
service B-TARGET
a O
bit O
long. O

We O
only O
tasted O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
that O
were O
any. O

Very O
reasonable O
prices. O

Service B-TARGET
extremely O
slow, O
waitresses B-TARGET
without O
a O
smile O
or O
minimal O
hospitality, O
need O
to O
claim O
the O
card, O
egg O
ham B-TARGET
grill I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
without O
taste O
and O
sad O
presentation. O

Great O
effort O
to O
do O
on O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

What O
a O
horrible O
memory! O

We O
were O
attracted O
like O
the O
other O
people O
by O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
and O
the O
low O
prices. O

But O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
were O
installed O
it O
was O
a O
disaster. O

We O
asked O
for O
Coca-Cola O
and O
were O
given O
soda B-TARGET
discounts O
without O
being O
informed, O
especially O
when O
it O
was O
hot. O

When O
we O
noticed O
this, O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
seemed O
not O
to O
understand. O

We O
ordered O
a O
menu. O

The O
entrance B-TARGET
was O
very O
thin, O
especially O
the O
salad. O

Then O
the O
maid O
and O
her O
husband, O
the O
cook, O
started O
talking O
next O
to O
our O
table O
about O
their O
sick O
son, O
who O
was O
not O
arriving O
to O
the O
toilet O
(they O
barely O
spoke O
big O
words O
in O
front O
of O
us). O

This O
discouraged O
us O
so O
much O
that O
we O
left O
before O
even O
waiting O
for O
the O
main O
meal. O

The O
maid B-TARGET
was O
rude O
as O
we O
explained O
not O
to O
appreciate O
their O
conversation, O
so O
we O
understood O
the O
seriousness O
of O
the O
establishment.... O

I O
totally O
reject O
this O
poor O
restaurant B-TARGET
or O
unfortunately O
many O
foreign O
tourists O
get O
trapped. O

The O
toilets O
were O
dirty. O

I O
noticed O
a O
little O
sign O
that O
said O
their O
duck B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
came O
from O
Eastern O
countries, O
a O
compliment O
to O
the O
country O
of O
the O
goat. O

This O
writing O
was O
well O
hidden O
inside O
the O
hotel O
so O
that O
customers O
on O
the O
terrace O
would O
not O
see O
it. O

I O

this O
restaurant B-TARGET

We O
came O
to O
lunch O
with O
my O
friend O
who O
had O
a O
very O
good O
memory O
of O
this O
restaurant O
and O
so O
insisted O
on O
the O
"top". O

We O
greet O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
table, O
which O
for O
restaurateurs B-TARGET
is O
the O
comble, O
we O
had O
the O
feeling O
of O
distracting O
them, O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
it, O
the O
customers O
inflated O
them, O
clearly! O

No O
politeness O
and O
installation O
at O
a O
dirty O
table O
that O
remained O
even O
when O
we O
took O
place. O

During O
the O
meal, O
we O
saw O
a O
server B-TARGET
depressed O
by O
his O
work O
(or O
perhaps O
by O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
at O
work); O
the O
"manager", B-TARGET
in O
any O
case, O
the O
one O
who O
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
tougher O
position, O
was O
the O
one O
who O
was O
most O
unpleasant. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
unbearable! O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean, O
the B-TARGET
staff O
was O
very O
helpful, O
the O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

If O
only O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
could O
have O
caught O
the O
staff!! B-TARGET

Next O
time, O
well O
there O
won't O
be O
any O
here O
anyway! O

We've O
come O
up O
current O
May O
2013 O
(I O
put O
in O
Feb O
2014 O
but O
we O
can't O
go O
back O
before O
) O
and O
I O
post O
only O
today, O
but O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
is O
not O
one O
of O
them, O
made O
me O
so O
hallucinate, O
(because O
yes O
people O
open O
a O
restaurant O
having O
absolutely O
no O
understanding O
of O
the O
business O
) O
that O
I've O
been O
delighted O
to O
raise O
it!! O
and O
I O
promise O
the O
next O
time O
I O
leave O
the O
restaurant O
from O
the O
beginning! O

It O
should O
be O
forbidden O
to O
pay O
for O
this! O

It O
is O
an O
insult O
to O
art, O
which O
is O
cooking. O

Could O
the O
explanation O
for O
this O
disaster O
come O
from O
an O
unscrupulous O
scout? O

because O
in O
the O
meantime O
I O
see O
positive O
opinions, O
which O
leaves O
me O
dubitative. O

At O
the O
festival O
of O
boats, O
we O
happened O
to O
arrive O
on O
this O
square. O

We O
were O
seduced O
by O
the O
front O
of O
this O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
without O
prejudice. O

We O
have O
had O
a O
very O
good O
time. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
was O
typical O
of O
the O
region O
(milk O
beef O
salad, O
sesame O
husk O
and O
its O
excellent O
riceotto....). B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
nicely O
presented O
and O
pleasantly O
good. O

We O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
return O
there. O

After O
going O
there O
twice, O
I O
really O
am O
not O
convinced. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

In O
fact, O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
too O
cooked, O
badly O
seasoned, O
damaging O
to O
an O
Italian O
restaurant. O

Damage, O
even O
if O
the O
bread B-TARGET
is O
excreted. O

Disappointed. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
really O
faint, O
tasteless. O

For O
someone O
who O
doesn't O
know O
anything O
about O
Indian O
cuisine O
to O
see O
spicy O
in O
general, O
it's O
okay O
but O
for O
others O
you'll O
be O
disappointed. O

It O
is O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

I O
went O
there O
2 O
times O
to O
be O
sure, O
but O
at O
each O
time O
the O
disappointment O
( O
various O
microwave-heated O
entrance B-TARGET
shelves, I-TARGET
elastic O
naan B-TARGET
bread O
and O
meat B-TARGET
(I O
had O
taken O
once O
the O
beef, O
once O
the O
lamb) O
fills O
with O
small O
pieces O
of O
fat. O

Not O
really, O
it's O
not O
a O
good O
Indian B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
simply O
excellent O
especially O
the O
specialty O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
the O
linguini B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
scrubs. I-TARGET

The O
boss B-TARGET
has O
a O
lot O
of O
humour O
and O
is O
happy O
to O
animate O
the O
room. O

A O
Pearl. O

Everyone O
knew O
except O
us! O

I O
have O
to O
say O
this O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
the O
massacre O
of O
others.... O

However O
when O
at O
20hoo O
in O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
it's O
empty O
it's O
that O
it's O
dull... O
But O
well O
we O
hadn't O
turned O
bad O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
Metz O
was O
complete.... O

Frankly O
Mac O
do O
would O
have O
arranged O
for O
me O
I'm O
sorry O
to O
say O
I'm O
never O
going O
there O
but O
I O
would O
have O
to O
think O
about O
it.... O

The O
hotel B-TARGET
is O
located O
in O
the O
heart O
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
city, I-TARGET
in O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
city O
centre O
and O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
city O
centre. O

What O
a O
mess. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
nice, O
the O
server B-TARGET
or O
boss O
is O
not O
professional. O

Suspicious O
smell, O
not O
at O
all O
in O
its O
place O
in O
what O
one O
wants O
a O
good O
restaurant. O

The O
aim O
is O
clearly O
to O
make O
the O
terrace O
more O
profitable. O

So O
you O
eat O
and, O
above O
all, O
you O
don't O
get O
caught O
up O
and O
you O
are O
made O
to O
understand O
it. O

No O
explanation O
on O
the O
tables. O

Unpleasant O
limit. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

It O
is O
the O
second O
time O
we O
go O
between O
noon O
and O
two O
and O
a O
little O
disappointed O
compared O
to O
the O
first O
time. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
all O
right O
but O
a O
duck B-TARGET
too O
dry, O
a O
tiramitsu B-TARGET
too O
expresso O
and O
a O
gaufre B-TARGET
to O
the O
chantilly O
too O
chocolated! O

The O
moelleux B-TARGET
speculos/chocolat I-TARGET
was O
a O
tom O
and O
not O
earth. O

A O
slightly O
salted O
addition O
still O
for O
the O
taste!!! O

Almost O
gastronomic, O
quality O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
full O
of O
flavors O
a O
delicacy, O
going O
there O
regularly O
at O
noon O
for O
my O
lunch O
break O
I O
am O
rarely O
disappointed O
and O
the O
hospitality B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
top, O
I O
recommend!! O

Great O
food, B-TARGET
generous O
and O
pretty O
good. O

Gentle O
but O
overloaded O
(success O
requires) O
hence O
a O
certain O
expectation O
that O
remains O
tolerable. O

I O
don't O
think O
you'll O
find O
the O
best O
burgers O
in O
town, O
but O
they're O
all O
right O

Located O
not O
far O
from O
my O
office, O
I O
go O
there O
quite O
regularly, O
on O
another O
passage O
I O
had O
been O
disappointed O
and O
I O
didn't O
want O
to O
stay O
on O
a O
bad O
impression O
because O
in O
restaurant O
it O
can O
have O
days O
without, O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
there O
with O
several O
colleagues O
but O
this O
time O
the O
impression O
is O
confirmed... O

Meat B-TARGET
is O
served O
blue, O
buffet B-TARGET
entrance I-TARGET
repeated O
and O
without O
interest, O
service B-TARGET
without O
smile, O
first O
arrive O
first O
forget. O

15 O
minutes O
after O
finishing O
the O
main O
dish O
we O
are O
still O
not O
cleared. O

No O
dessert, O
no O
coffee, O
the O
note O
thank O
you O
and O
goodbye. O

A O
warm O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
bottles O
of O
wine. O

Very O
expensive O
and O
cheap O
dishes!! B-TARGET

With O
a O
small O
story O
on O
the O
wine O
bottle O
chosen O
excellently O
told O
by O
the O
very O
pleasant O
patron. B-TARGET

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
definitely O
recommend O
for O
the O
downtown O
of O
Toulouse. O

Notice O
+++++ O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
with O
friends. O

We O
found O
the O
expensive O
prices O
for O
a O
popular O
neighbourhood O
restaurant; B-TARGET
Que O
du O
surgelé O
plus. O

And O
no O
rabbit, O
if O
you O
are O
still O
hungry.... O

I O
do O
not O
advise O
you. O

The O
boss B-TARGET
is O
interested O
only O
in O
the O
usual O
ones O
(the O
office O
firms), O
the O
others O
go O
after... O

Entrance, B-TARGET
table, B-TARGET
dessert B-TARGET
we O
loved! O

Very O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
great O
view B-TARGET
of O
St. O
Etienne O
Cathedral, O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly! O

Recommend! O

To O
do O
before O
closing O
because O
it O
is O
a O
mythical O
place B-TARGET
of O
Lille. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

I'm O
sorry O
but O
I O
can O
say O
"I O
was O
there!". O

We O
went O
there O
for O
lunch, O
we O
didn't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
eat O
(as O
most O
clients O
do). O

Our O
order: O
steak O
tartare, O
chef O
salad O
and O
san O
pellegrino... O
normally O
fast O
cold O
dishes O
to O
make. O

... O

All O
the O
tables O
around O
us, O
arriving O
after O
us, O
had O
their O
orders O
quickly O
and O
strangely O
for O
us O
it O
drags. O

.... O
so O
my O
friend O
will O
take O
news O
from O
our O
dishes O
by O
specifying O
that O
we O
are O
pressed O
"I'll O
see O
where O
it O
is" O
then O
radio O
silence. O

15 O
minutes O
later O
I O
come O
back: O
"the O
next O
dishes O
will O
be O
yours O
don't O
worry" O

4 O
plates O
later O
still O
no O
trace O
of O
our O
seats. O

.. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
40 O
minutes O
of O
waiting, B-TARGET
we O
decided O
to O
leave. O

I O
explained O
the O
reason O
to O
a O
waiter O
who O
was O
forced O
to O
tie O
and O
there O
chewed O
on O
the O
cake: O
she O
charged O
us O
the O
bottle O
of O
water O
without O
an O
excuse!! O

A O
maid O
will O
grab O
us O
out O
to O
apologize O
and O
tell O
us O
that O
our O
dishes O
are O
ready O
to O
arrive: O
" O
too O
late O
I'll O
get O
back O
to O
work O
in O
15min!" O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

I O
can O
understand O
that O
we've O
forgotten, O
mistakes O
happen, O
but O
there O
are O
ways O
to O
get O
the O
pill O
through. O

We O
will O
no O
longer O
put O
our O
foot O
in O
it! O

We O
are O
not O
here O
in O
a O
tourist O
restaurant, O
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
simple O
and O
over, O
even O
a O
little O
too O
to O
my O
taste, O
I O
like O
the O
cosy O
interiors O
and O
the O
chichis O
ptits, O
the O
wine O
map O
on O
a O
sheet O
A5 O
folded O
in O
two O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
waste O
at O
first O
sight. O

But O
we O
are O
not O
there O
for O
that O
either, O
but O
for O
eating O
roaches B-TARGET
that O
seem O
to O
have O
made O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
old O
flower O
residue O
here. O

Famous O
dishes O
arrive, O
neither O
too O
early O
nor O
without O
waiting. O

Really O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
these O
small O
roosters, B-TARGET
we O
understand O
their O
success, O
even O
if O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
little O
more O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
dressing. B-TARGET

Dessert: O
Chestnuts O
and O
delicious O
coffee. O

My O
husband O
really O
appreciated O
his O
good O
and O
consistent O
dessert. B-TARGET

For O
my O
part, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
spéculos B-TARGET
cream. I-TARGET

I O
will O
certainly O
return O
there O
to O
eat O
a O
dish O
that O
comes O
out O
of O
what O
can O
be O
done O
in O
the O
old O
flower O
to O
attract O
the O
tourist, O
even O
though O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
few O
euros O
less O
on O
the O
addition. O

Finally, O
contrary O
to O
what O
I O
could O
read O
here, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
particularly O
clean O
during O
my O
passage. O

Address O
tested O
during O
a O
team O
meal O
(including O
a O
large O
table). O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
clean O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
correct, O
although O
a O
bit O
long O
(but O
perhaps O
it O
lacked O
staff O
that O
day). O

I O
enjoyed O
having O
different O
entrance O
and O
dining O
covers O
(because O
how O
many O
restaurants O
now O
leave O
you O
the O
same O
covers!). O

and O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
shelves. B-TARGET

My O
choices O
were O
from O
the O
countryside O
terrine, O
flamenco O
carbonate, O
and O
a O
lost O
brooch O
with O
a O
caramel O
ice O
ball. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

My O
fellow O
Members O
were O
also O
satisfied O
with O
their O
overall O
positions. B-TARGET

Address B-TARGET
to O
test O
without O
hesitation. O

We O
took O
the O
liver B-TARGET
pastes I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cabbage, I-TARGET
they O
were O
bathing O
in O
cream O
and O
balsamic O
cream! O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
oil! O

We O
also O
took O
the O
risotto B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
St I-TARGET
Jacques I-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
rich O
in O
cream! O

And O
the O
St B-TARGET
Jacques's I-TARGET
were O
amazing! O

We O
are O
part O
of O
it! O

Very O
disappointing. O

If O
the O
score O
is O
low O
(61.90) O
for O
a O
meal B-TARGET
and O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
month. O

It O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
travel O
for O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
poor O
there. O

We O
had O
never O
had O
a O
gog O
of O
sardines, B-TARGET
half O
of O
which O
was O
salad. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
not O
home, O
which O
affects O
the O
taste. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
moderate. O

The O
absence O
of O
crude O
customers O
was O
a O
good O
indicator, O
trapped! O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
place B-TARGET
with O
my O
friend O
or O
spend O
a O
good O
time O
while O
eating O
well, O
it O
was O
the O
perfect O
place! O
and O
we O
also O
had O
a O
good O
drink, O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
a O
similar O
name, O
it O
seems O
normal O
by O
the O
way... O

The O
manager B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly: O
we O
recommend O
without O
hesitation. O

and O
I'll O
go O
back O
with O
my O
lover! O

We O
had O
lunch O
in O
this O
small O
restaurant. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

The O
advantage O
is O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
take O
meals O
to O
carry. O

I O
took O
a O
"galette" B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
(galette O
+ O
crêpe O
+ O
boiled O
cider O
at O
9€40). O

It O
is O
a O
good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

The O
galettes B-TARGET
are O
copieous O
and O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
are O
excellent, O
fine O
and O
light. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
and O
a O
daily B-TARGET
galette I-TARGET
are O
also O
offered. O

A O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
when O
you O
know O
how O
many O
leftovers O
there O
are O
on O
the O
street. O

Knowing O
that O
there O
are O
a O
majority O
of O
tourist O
restaurants. O

It O
has O
a O
good O
quality-price O
ratio. O

To O
say O
that O
everything O
is O
free? O

In O
any O
case, O
it O
is O
good O
and O
well O
cooked. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

Very O
good O
for O
a O
small O
outing O
between O
friends O
on O
a O
Saturday O
evening. O

I O
recommend O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
stopped O
by O
chance O
and O
went O
away O
conquered. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
rich O
but O
it's O
normal O
because O
everything O
is O
fresh O
and O
cooked O
on O
site. O

The O
dessert O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

Only O
bemol, O
the O
price O
of O
the O
wine B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
glass O
that O
is O
too O
expensive. O

Very O
well O
located O
on O
the O
harbour B-TARGET
facing O
the O
aquarium. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
and O
very O
cosy O
lounge O
decor. B-TARGET

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
what O
was O
on O
my O
desk: B-TARGET
danger! O

I O
lifted O
the O
lid O
of O
my O
burger O
to O
check O
and O
fell O
on O
all-flavored O
salad B-TARGET
sheets I-TARGET
not O
to O
say O
worse O
than O
that. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
were O
almost O
turned O
into O
purée O
so O
they O
were O
fat-free. O

Beurk. O

If O
you O
have O
fragile O
health, O
go O
your O
way. O

We O
wanted O
fried O
mussels O
and O
were O
a O
little O
disappointed: O
too O
cooked O
(or O
even O
re-cooked), O
dry O
and O
fade. O

Ok O
this O
is O
not O
the O
season, O
we O
will O
not O
take O
it O
back. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
and O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
were O
poor. O

A O
correct O
map B-TARGET
but O
more O
to O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
day, O
without O
too O
much O
evolution. O

Very O
nice O
frame B-TARGET
mainly O
ext O
despite O
a O
lack O
of O
gardener..... O

The O
weekly O
lunch O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
affordable, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excellent. O

Good O
quality O
service. B-TARGET

An B-TARGET
exceptional I-TARGET
setting; I-TARGET
the O
room O
is O
in O
an O
old O
converted O
abbey. O

I've O
been O
staying O
in O
this O
hotel O
for O
two O
months O
because O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
no O
longer O
up O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
chain. O

What O
is O
regularly O
delayed, O
are O
the O
meat B-TARGET
dishes: I-TARGET
blue O
coming O
cold O
just O
frozen O
in O
the O
center, O
just O
blue O
sagnant, O
etc... O
the O
chips B-TARGET
offered O
at O
the O
entrance O
were O
infected: O
oily O
like O
spoons O
and O
with O
the O
taste O
of O
brulé. O

In O
short, O
if O
this O
facility B-TARGET
does O
not O
recover, O
it O
will O
lose O
its O
regular O
customers O
(passing O
people O
will O
be O
trapped, O
but O
this O
will O
harm O
the O
entire O
chain). O

we O
found O
these O
negligences O
three O
times O
before O
deciding O
not O
to O
put O
our O
foot O
back O
on O
it. O

The O
one O
from O
Limoges O
is O
incomparably O
better. O

In O
addition, O
we O
waited O
a O
long O
time O
for O
a O
carafe O
of O
water O
and O
the O
sauce O
supposed O
to O
accompany O
the O
meat O
during O
our O
last O
test. O

Very O
disappointed O
with O
what O
it O
was O
in O
the O
past. O

only O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
correct O
in O
relation O
to O
Q/P, O
the O
entrances B-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
uneven O
in O
relation O
to O
them. O

Very O
disappointed, O
little O
friendliness, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
hygiene O
is O
not O
at O
the O
appointment O
(guardian O
hair O
detached O
and O
greasy) O
the O
chef O
surprised O
as O
he O
picks O
in O
the O
dishes O
with O
his O
fingers, O
very O
dirty O
dishes, O
meats O
cooked O
in O
advance, O
food B-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
bread O
sold O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
free O
service O
in O
the O
room. O

Go O
your O
way O
it's O
better O
not O
to O
recommend. O

A B-TARGET
refined O
and O
generous O
kitchen O
that O
works O
with O
quality O
products. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
become O
our O
favorite O
on O
Poitiers, O
so O
we O
highly O
recommend O
it!!! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room I-TARGET
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

I O
recommend O
this O
little O
rest O
to O
all. O

I O
think O
to O
return O
there O
very O
quickly O
as O
a O
couple O
this O
time O
because O
the O
setting B-TARGET
and O
beautiful, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
reception B-TARGET
very O
warm O

We O
were O
very O
well O
received, O
by O
a O
lovely O
maid, B-TARGET
but O
the O
rest O
was O
a O
horrible O
experience. O

40 O
minutes O
show O
in O
hand O
for O
with O
a O
roasted O
salad B-TARGET
and O
warm O
feet B-TARGET
that O
should O
have O
at O
least O
3 O
days. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
dry O
and O
smooth. O

Poor O
quality/price O
ratio. O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

The O
friendly O
patron B-TARGET
and O
the O
wines B-TARGET
served O
in O
glass O
or O
bottle O
are O
good..beaucoup O
of O
originality O
in O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
offered, O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
very O
good... O

A O
little O
expensive, O
however O

The O
delivery B-TARGET
of O
brunch O
at O
home O
is O
really O
a O
genius O
idea! O

If O
you O
add O
fresh O
products, B-TARGET
original O
tastes O
and O
recipes, B-TARGET
it's O
paradise! O

The O
prices O
are O
also O
very O
reasonable O
(20 O
euros O
for O
the O
highest O
formula, O
delivery O
included) O
and O
the O
quantities, B-TARGET
more O
than O
copieous. O

Home B-TARGET
sweets I-TARGET
are O
a O
delicacy, O
I O
recommend O
prune B-TARGET
- I-TARGET
fennel, I-TARGET
atypical O
but O
divine O
association! O

This O
place B-TARGET
should O
be O
opened O
more O
often O
and O
have O
more O
space O
and O
staff. O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
because O
it's O
different O
from O
the O
usual O
snacks. O

But O
this O
gentle O
patronage B-TARGET
is O
quickly O
overwhelmed. O

These O
bagels B-TARGET
are O
good, O
few O
choices O
but O
quality, O
and O
she O
always O
has O
the O
smile O
and O
the O
nice O
word. O

If O
they O
improve O
certain O
points O
it O
can O
quickly O
be O
a O
vicitimate O
of O
its O
success O
go O
there O
a O
tour O
if O
you O
are O
curious. O

It O
is O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
on O
the O
pulse O
at O
midday O
away O
from O
the O
fat O
and O
the O
usual O
snacks O
that O
you O
forget. O

Super O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
tip O
top O
among O
friends. O

After O
midnight, O
regulars O
smoke O
their O
cigarettes O
in O
a O
bar O
cage. O

We O
even O
saw O
a O
waiter O
smoking O
in O
the O
kitchen! O

Repository O
for O
our O
group O
of O
friends! O

Place B-TARGET
to O
avoid O
the O
evening O
if O
you O
are O
a O
family O
because O
apparently O
there O
were O
some O
evenings O
with O
a O
theme O
and O
so O
the O
organizers O
(not O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
place) O
made O
us O
understand O
that O
we O
had O
to O
leave. O

Excellent O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Ambiance B-TARGET
and O
deco B-TARGET
super. O

A O
change O
with O
a O
new O
card. O

Hamburgers, B-TARGET
succulent O
pizzas, B-TARGET
brushettas, B-TARGET
and O
an O
exceptional O
Milanese B-TARGET
escalope. I-TARGET

You O
are O
going O
to O
settle O
for O
yourself. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
honestly O
very O
good! O

The O
chef O
does O
not O
take O
the O
goods: O
a O
well-dressed O
pizza! B-TARGET

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
friendly O
and O
available. O

Only O
bemol: O
the O
chef O
speaks O
(cries) O
a O
little O
strongly O
on O
the O
maids O
at O
least O
a O
little O
cross-talk, O
a O
little O
too O
strict O
to O
my O
taste O
(I O
don't O
want O
to O
be O
in O
their O
place). O

I O
would O
still O
be O
happy O
to O
return O
there; O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
:) O

I O
was O
there O
with O
the O
usual O
people O
who O
had O
told O
me O
about O
it O
and O
that O
it O
was O
not O
our O
disappointment: O

- O
service B-TARGET
far O
too O
long O
knowing O
that O
we O
arrived O
among O
the O
first O
(19:45) O
that O
we O
were O
placed O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
terrace O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
and O
that O
we O
were O
distributed O
at O
22h15 O
while O
people O
who O
arrived O
after O
us O
were O
distributed O
well O
before... O

- O
uncautious O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
dropped O
the O
covers O
on O
my O
colleague O
while O
pushing O
her O
without O
excuses, O
for O
a O
table O
of O
4 O
he O
was O
carrying O
us O
water O
carafes O
one O
by O
one O
(containment O
75 O
cl) O
while O
we O
had O
suggested O
to O
him O
to O
carry O
2 O
each O
time O
so O
that O
it O
arranges O
everyone O
but O
did O
not O
hear O
what O
makes O
that O
we O
waited O
times O
more O
than O
a O
1/4h O
to O
desaltérer O
with O
an O
ambient O
temperature O
water O
(30°) O
- O
The O
ice O
creams O
were O
carried O
us O
into O
a O
ice O
cutter O
without O
spoon O
sympathetic B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
hygiene! I-TARGET

- O
food: O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
good, O
for O
the O
supions B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
persillade I-TARGET
go O
your O
way O
because O
there O
is O
much O
better. O

Indeed, O
the O
soups B-TARGET
are O
served O
barely O
fried O
with O
whole O
garlic O
heads, O
just O
like O
the O
unprecedented O
sautéed B-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
and, O
above O
all, O
no O
taste! O

In O
addition O
the O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
too O
salty O
so O
need O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
(cf O
2nd O
paragraph) O
- O
desserts: O
frozen B-TARGET
lemons I-TARGET
nothing O
to O
say O
because O
it O
is O
the O
usual O
industrial, O
tiramisu B-TARGET
is O
served O
with O
chantilly O
and O
cream O
english??? O

Never O
seen O
and O
especially O
not O
interested O
in O
my O
favourite O
dessert B-TARGET
that O
suffices O
without O
artifice... O

- O
Lemoncello: B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
menu O
at O
30€, O
served O
at O
room O
temperature O
as O
well O
as O
water O
while O
it O
is O
served O
ice... O

In O
conclusion O
for O
everyone O
very O
disappointing O
and O
the O
price O
quality O
ratio O
there O
is O
not O
at O
all O
so O
much O
at O
the O
level O
of O
service B-TARGET
or O
meals B-TARGET
served O
because O
when O
you O
want O
to O
put O
your O
foot O
in O
the O
decorum O
you O
do O
not O
have O
to O
neglect O
the O
rest O
something O
that O
the O
owner O
seems O
to O
have O
lost O
sight O
of O
when O
his O
father O
understood O
it! O

I O
had O
booked O
a O
table O
for O
9 O
people O
with O
sea O
view O
4 O
days O
in O
advance O
for O
a O
birthday O
party. O

As O
a O
result O
there O
was O
no O
more O
table O
on O
the O
terrace O
overlooking O
the O
sea, O
installed O
in O
the O
interior, O
table O
not O
installed O
either! O

Wok B-TARGET
thai I-TARGET
poor, O
2 O
beef/saumon B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
one O
correct O
but O
the O
other O
lacked O
broth O
and O
brique O
leaf!!! O

We O
ask O
for O
finger O
rinses O
for O
seafood, O
they O
arrive O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
dessert O
with O
excuses O
"we O
had O
more, O
we O
went O
looking O
elsewhere" O
astonishing O
when O
offered O
seafood O
plates. O

To O
finish O
the O
fries B-TARGET
(mostly O
a O
mousse O
decorated O
with O
some O
fries) O
ordered O
for O
the O
anniversary O
came O
on O
the O
table O
like O
a O
cheveu O
on O
the O
soup! O

After O
decoupling O
we O
found O
ourselves O
with O
a O
pile O
of O
cream O
in O
the O
dishes!!! O

Thankfully O
I O
had O
planned O
the O
candles O
because O
no O
particular O
attention O
from O
the O
servers B-TARGET
to O
know O
if O
everything O
was O
going O
well, O
if O
the O
gateau O
would O
suit O
us, O
finally O
a O
minimum O
of O
attention O
would O
have O
been O
appreciated O
for O
an O
addition O
of O
270 O
euros!!!!!!!!!!!! O

Perfectly O
matches O
the O
tourist B-TARGET
trap I-TARGET
in O
every O
respect. O

Guests O
are O
attracted O
by O
a O
photo O
panel O
of O
passing O
personalities O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

A O
delicious O
map B-TARGET
of O
local O
specialties, O
continuous O
service O
and O
exorbitant O
prices. O

In O
fact, O
we O
are O
accepted O
at O
15:00 O
for O
breakfast O
at O
8:00, O
but O
the O
server O
is O
alone O
at O
this O
time O
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
still O
well O
filled. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
therefore O
extremely O
long O
and O
very O
disorganised. O

When O
to O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
very O
disappointing. O

The O
breakfast O
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

In O
short, O
a O
very O
salty O
addition O
for O
a O
very O
long O
meal B-TARGET
and O
eaten O
without O
pleasure! O

First O
of O
all O
a O
server B-TARGET
literally O
jumped O
us O
over O
when O
we O
read O
the O
card, O
despite O
this O
rather O
brutal O
method O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
card B-TARGET
didn't O
look O
bad, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
accept, O
then O
after O
we O
made O
our O
choice, O
the O
wait B-TARGET
was O
long, O
fortunately O
the O
gathering O
of O
a O
maid O
with O
her O
chairs O
made O
us O
spend O
time, O
they O
made O
us O
feel O
bad. O

However, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
correct, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
seats O
were O
installed, O
the O
server B-TARGET
took O
my O
half O
of O
Leffe O
which O
was O
not O
finished O
without O
me O
seeing O
it, O
it's O
a O
rather O
dubious O
practice O
to O
push O
to O
consumption, O
I O
suppose O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
restart O
it O
since O
in O
addition O
he O
did O
not O
put O
on O
the O
table O
neither O
water O
nor O
bread, O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
him, O
and O
he O
replied O
to O
wait O
because O
he O
had O
no O
more O
bread, O
that O
means O
he O
was O
waiting O
for O
a O
table O
to O
open O
to O
give O
us O
its O
corbeille? O

And O
finally, O
I O
go O
to O
the O
cashier O
to O
pay, O
and O
there, O
the O
cheese O
on O
the O
cake O
he O
announces O
that O
they O
don't O
take O
the O
card, O
in O
2015, O
with O
such O
a O
geographical O
situation, O
and O
all O
these O
tourists, O
it's O
the O
first O
time O
I O
hear O
this, O
it O
feels O
like O
the O
arcade, O
right? O

So O
I O
had O
to O
take O
off O
with O
a O
server O
who O
followed O
me O
in O
case O
I O
had O
decided O
not O
to O
come O
back, O
plus O
we O
have O
the O
impression O
of O
being O
the O
thieves, O
and O
when O
I O
came O
back O
a O
gentleman B-TARGET
was O
present O
at O
the O
cash O
register, O
he O
would O
not O
care O
and O
in O
addition O
was O
very O
unpleasant. O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
stay B-TARGET
and O
the O
staff O
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

We O
chose O
this O
restaurant O
a O
bit O
by O
chance: O
at O
two O
steps, O
we O
were O
attracted O
by O
a O
menu B-TARGET
highlighting O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
home-made. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
the O
place O
is O
pleasant O
(low O
traffic). O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
refined: O
the O
market B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
with O
its O
3 O
surprises O
is O
delicious. O

The O
bubblebaisse, B-TARGET
copieus, O
was O
a O
regular O
(no O
more O
edges!). O

The O
only O
little O
bemol: O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
was O
served O
to O
me O
almost O
cold, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
the O
time O
it O
took O
to O
prepare O
the O
bouillabaisse. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
recommend... O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
I O
used O
to O
know O
for O
business O
meals. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
place O
to O
stay, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

a O
regular O
on O
the B-TARGET
plancha I-TARGET
fish: I-TARGET
hyper O
fresh O
fish, B-TARGET
and O
very O
well O
prepared. O

A O
little O
wait B-TARGET
for O
the O
desserts, O
but O
normal O
given O
the O
abundance O
(reputation O
and O
quality O
oblige). O

In O
addition, O
quality O
ratio O
taken O
very O
correctly O
(45€ O
per O
person O
with O
an O
excellent O
wine B-TARGET
). O

we O
will O
come O
back O
to O
taste O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
map...and O
for O
a O
beautiful O
sunset O
on O
the O
bay O
of O
Marseille O
and O
the O
Isles. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
exposed, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
of O
great O
quality. O

The O
products B-TARGET
used O
are O
fresh O
and O
everything O
we O
ate O
was O
super O
good. O

We O
will O
certainly O
return O
there O
to O
eat O
under O
this O
magnificent O
plateau B-TARGET
which O
represents O
well O
the O
terrace O
of O
southern O
France. O

Special O
mention O
to O
servers B-TARGET
for O
their O
professionalism. O

They O
are O
able O
to O
comfort O
clients O
by O
giving O
them O
good O
advice O
without O
disturbing O
them. O

it O

a O

and O
some O

were O
faux. O

The O
confit B-TARGET
does O
not O
look O
like O
a O
confit O
(it O
looks O
like O
a O
sausage) O
and O
the O
taste O
does O
not O
follow O
either. O

The O
St. B-TARGET
Jacques I-TARGET
croustade I-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
of O
our O
dishes O
(the O
St. B-TARGET
Jacques's I-TARGET
are O
generous O
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
good). O

In O
short, O
not O
bad, O
but O
a O
little O
disappointing. O

We O
booked O
this O
restaurant O
because O
it O
was O
recommended O
by O
the O
Gault O
et O
Millau, O
it O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
déco B-TARGET
and O
everything O
seemed O
to O
be O
coming O
together O
to O
discover O
a O
new O
good O
table O
on O
Marseille. O

Unfortunately, O
what O
a O
disappointment! O

No O
wine O
less O
than O
35 O
€ O
per O
bottle, B-TARGET
prices O
that O
would O
be O
justified O
if O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
was O
high. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
was O
hard, O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
was O
frozen O
and O
tasteless. O

In O
addition, O
one O
of O
the O
guests O
was O
ill O
after O
the O
meal. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

Well O
we O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
falling, O
we'll O
say O
it O
like O
it..... O

Unpleasant O
servants, B-TARGET
aren't O
you O
in O
the O
corner? O

damage! O

count O
your O
money, O
believe O
me, O
you O
have O
frankly O
interet. O

He O
hit O
us, O
but O
we O
could O
see O
that O
tonight, O
they O
hit O
at O
least O
eight O
tables O
that O
complained. O

Well, O
of O
course O
the O
error O
was O
in O
their O
favour!!! O
before O
twenty O
euros O
for O
us O
on O
an O
addition O
of O
85€! O

For O
example O
20%!!! O
The O
most O
beautiful: O
without O
showing O
up: O
"Well O
what O
is O
the O
forboire!!!!" O
Nothing O
more O
to O
say O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
go O
there O
not O
to O
make O
an O
original O
discovery, O
but O
of O
the O
"classical".... O

It O
looks O
like O
what O
restaurateurs O
are O
looking O
for O
at O
Metro.... O

Coincidence?..... O

It's O
nice O
to O
have O
a O
rest B-TARGET
at O
the O
waterside. O

Most O
importantly, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
rather O
pleasant, O
the O
generous O
portions B-TARGET
and O
the O
places B-TARGET
really O
nice. O

But O
that's O
what O
it O
is O
fat! O

These O
poor O
chickens B-TARGET
could O
have O
died O
of O
excess O
cholesterol O
if O
they O
hadn't O
finished O
on O
the O
plate. O

And O
hop, O
one O
after O
midday O
to O
digest O
them. O

And O
I'm O
not O
talking O
about O
the O
aïoli... B-TARGET

So O
well O
but O
I O
could O
really O
earn O
in O
quality. O

Last O
remark, O
why O
salmon?? O

Is O
there O
not O
enough O
variety O
of O
fish O
in O
the O
Mediterranean? O

Come O
on, O
a O
little O
effort O
what! O

We O
liked O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
from O
the O
time O
of O
the O
old O
team O
but O
then O
there O
was O
a O
disappointment. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. B-TARGET
The O
room B-TARGET
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
good O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
simple O
compared O
to O
the O
prices. O

A O
salmon B-TARGET
turtle I-TARGET
with O
too O
many O
onions. O

A O
steamed O
salmon O
served O
also O
with O
an O
onion O
sauce... O

A O
proposed O
buffalo B-TARGET
XL O
but O
in O
the O
seat O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
was O
too O
cold, O
so O
disappointment, O
it's O
better O
to O
have O
a O
smaller O
but O
better O
buffalo. O

The O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
for O
what O
we O
have O
been O
offered. O

In O
fact O
there O
were O
only O
three O
tables O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
a O
Friday O
night! O

But O
what O
has O
happened? O

In O
2 O
months O
this O
resto B-TARGET
has O
degraded O
at O
a O
phenomenal O
rate! O

Total O
disorganization O
of O
service, B-TARGET
forced O
to O
repeatedly O
return O
the O
aperitif O
as O
well O
as O
the O
wine, O
to O
believe O
that O
they O
do O
not O
want O
to O
be O
consumed. O

An O
endless O
wait B-TARGET
before O
ordering. O

Normal O
when O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
don't O
manage O
their O
tables... O
Vacances O
goes O
and O
comes O
without O
any O
service B-TARGET
logic! O

Fortunately, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
captures O
this O
but O
what O
a O
delight O
for O
this O
small O
Italian O
restaurant O
with O
a O
beautiful O
terrace B-TARGET
and O
fresh O
products. O

Please, O
Mr. O
Manager, O
put O
order O
into O
your O
organization. O

The O
person O
who O
welcomes O
and O
places O
people O
would O
be O
better O
at O
managing O
the O
service B-TARGET
rather O
than O
putting O
their O
hands O
in O
their O
pockets. O

It O
is O
not O
understood O
to O
assign O
to O
each O
server O
a O
part O
of O
the O
rest O
and O
so O
each O
can O
follow O
its O
commands O

I've O
been O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
years. O

And O
that's O
always O
the O
same. O

The O
formula B-TARGET
is O
perfect. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
always O
cooked O
as O
desired O
and O
if O
you O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
fries O
ask O
the O
server B-TARGET
to O
bring O
you O
a O
plate. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
attentive. O

In O
short, O
a O
Resto B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
come O
together O
with O
friends O
to O
eat O
well O
and O
quickly O
if O
you O
wish. O

It O
was O
almost O
by O
chance O
that O
we O
dined O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
positively O
surprised. O

First O
of O
all, O
the O
reception B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant, O
welcoming O
and O
coming. O

The O
unpretentious O
kitchen B-TARGET
remains O
simple O
and O
good O
quality. O

Balanced O
portions, B-TARGET
except O
perhaps O
for O
the O
entrance B-TARGET
(grained O
mussels) O
which O
was O
too O
small O
as O
long O
as O
the O
mussels B-TARGET
were O
good. O

The O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
was O
perfectly O
adequate O
and O
at O
a O
more O
than O
reasonable O
price, O
14 O
euros... O

We O
recommend O
this O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
located O
in O
the O
Pannier O
district. O

A O
good O
surprise O
on O
the O
port B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Marseille. I-TARGET

The O
prices O
are O
correct, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
in O
quantity O
and O
with O
a O
wide O
choice O
(a O
cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
displays O
more O
than O
30 O
specimens!) O

Of O
course, O
it's O
not O
about O
gastronomy, O
but O
you O
don't O
come O
to O
a O
free O
buffet O
for O
that. O

So O
we're O
back O
and O
happy O
to O
have O
spent O
a O
good O
time O
for O
not O
too O
expensive O
(on O
the O
harbour, B-TARGET
it's O
pretty O
remarkable). O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
it O
doesn't O
justify O
the O
prices O
for O
a O
fair O
average O
quality. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
as O
its O
name O
indicates O
is O
rather O
a O
gage O
of O
fragrance O
and O
quality; O
on O
that O
day, O
if O
the O
dressing B-TARGET
was O
suitable, O
the O
very O
limited O
accompaniment B-TARGET
of O
dried O
and O
cold O
pasta. B-TARGET

Suitable O
service, B-TARGET
but O
not O
renewed, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
small O
restaurants O
that O
know O
to O
serve O
better O
quality O
cuisine O

I O
have O
known O
the O
address O
for O
a O
long O
time O

but B-TARGET
great I-TARGET
disappointment: I-TARGET

a O
nice O
pizza B-TARGET
but O
served O
without O
covers? O

A O
pressure B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
at O
3.7 O
euros O
without O
a O
bubble O
with O
a O
taste O
of O
water, O
in O
short, O
a O
beer O
cut O
to O
water. O

Server O
response: O
yes, O
there O
are O
problems O
at O
the O
moment? O

(with O
a O
small O
smile O
in O
the O
corner) O

I O
took O
my O
chance O
with O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
6 O
euros O
arrived O
open O
with O
a O
round O
of O
lemon O
inside?? O

I O
went O
without O
bubbles O
and O
a O
taste O
of O
water. O

The O
neighbour O
at O
the O
side O
table O
returned O
her O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
on O
the O
pretext O
that O
there O
were O
so O
many O
ice O
creams O
that O
she O
no O
longer O
enjoyed O
the O
wine. O

As O
mentioned O
earlier: O
don't O
go O
to O
the O
toilet, O
get O
out O
of O
the O
way! O

18 O
year O
old O
servants B-TARGET
very O
nice O
but O
tips O
not O
possible O
there.... O

What O
a O
shame! O

It O
is O
absolutely O
not O
to O
caution O
this!! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
st O
unpleasant, O
it O
is O
a O
dining B-TARGET
area I-TARGET
for I-TARGET
tourists, I-TARGET
as O
is O
the O
place O
where O
you O
"wait" O
really O
the O
tourist. O

Non-fresh O
bottled O
wine, B-TARGET
a O
fairly O
expensive O
bottled B-TARGET
wine O
and O
a O
less O
attractive O
bottled B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET

Canteen O
service, B-TARGET
the O
waiter B-TARGET
carries O
the O
"soup" O
of O
fish O
between O
her O
2 O
hands O
because O
the O
seat O
is O
warm, O
without O
litter, O
without O
class O
really O

we O
do O
more O
than O
get O
back O
to O
it O
to O
really O
avoid O

Attractive O
by O
the O
facade O
declining O
as O
rather O
chic, O
although O
the O
price O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at O
15€ O
did O
not O
inspire O
a O
refined O
cuisine... O
but O
here O
it O
is O
worse O
than O
anything... O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days. O

Sea B-TARGET
mussels I-TARGET
that O
were O
borrowing....in O
their O
water O
yes O
without O
sauce: O
no O
interests!!! O

For O
me O
the O
worst O
remains O
the O
service!! B-TARGET

There O
was O
no O
management: B-TARGET
15 O
to O
20 O
minutes O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
between O
each O
dish, O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
serving O
dishes O
on O
the O
side O
table O
but O
leaving O
us O
only O
10 O
minutes O
after...and O
the O
must....when O
at O
the O
choice O
of O
dessert B-TARGET
there O
was O
only O
one O
red O
fruit O
dessert O
on O
the O
4 O
options O
of O
the O
menu...my O
friend O
didn't O
like O
the O
latter...the O
boss B-TARGET
refused O
to O
exchange O
coffee O
for O
the O
dessert O
he O
didn't O
take..... O

A O
relational O
customer O
naz! O

As O
for O
the O
acid O
and O
petillante O
fruit B-TARGET
salad... I-TARGET
I O
suspect O
they O
put O
orangina O
in O
it... O

Why?! O
I O
would O
never O
know!!! O

Don't O
let O
the O
attractive O
price O
and O
front, O
competitors O
practice O
the O
same O
types O
of O
menus O
and O
are O
more O
quality O
and O
more O
pleasant O

Rest B-TARGET
on O
the O
seafront O
ideally O
located. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
warm O
welcome. B-TARGET

Nevertheless, O
expensive O
meals, B-TARGET
no O
choice, O
heavy O
and O
very O
fat. O

I O
will O
not O
return O
to O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
even O
after O
10 O
hours O
of O
digestion, O
the O
hot B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
has O
still O
not O
passed. O

....what O
a O
cold O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
what O
an O
antipathic O
service! B-TARGET

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

We O
asked O
her O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it, O
she O
didn't, O
but O
she O
passed O
three O
times O
in O
front O
of O
us O
empty O
hands...it's O
very O
mediocre. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
nice O
but O
the O
hospitality B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
did O
not O
deserve O
us O
to O
come O
back. O

At O
the O
beginning O
we O
already O
had O
the O
impression O
of O
disturbing, O
to O
the O
limit O
not O
too O
serious O
tourist O
city O
and O
many O
of O
the O
world O
so O
I O
think O
the O
servers O
tired. O

Once O
the O
meal B-TARGET
at O
the O
table, O
a O
disaster, O
not O
to O
mention O
errors O
or O
wrongdoings, O
a O
distorted O
impression O
of O
meat B-TARGET
and O
I O
pass... O

When O
we O
went O
to O
the O
toilet O
we O
saw O
a O
facility B-TARGET
in O
a O
more O
than O
laborious O
state, O
worse O
than O
in O
our O
worst O
nightmares, O
dirty, O
broken, O
how O
can O
you O
eat O
in O
such O
a O
place, O
I O
felt O
bad O
to O
see O
it. O

Close O
immediately. O

Please O
go O
somewhere O
else. O
Thank O
you. O

Under O
the O
sun O
of O
the O
Estaque, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
has O
a O
small O
side O
deco B-TARGET
very O
nice O
(table O
way O
teck, O
"sets" O
in O
ardoise). O

The O
great O
+, O
it O
is O
the O
welcoming O
care O
of O
the O
2 O
maids, B-TARGET
available O
and O
well-known O
to O
the O
dishes. O

I O
chose O
a O
freshly B-TARGET
harvested I-TARGET
sea I-TARGET
wolf I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
its I-TARGET
rat I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
purée I-TARGET
accompanied I-TARGET
by I-TARGET
olive I-TARGET
oil I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
herbs I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
berries, I-TARGET
all O
of O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
little O
insipid. O

I O
am O
so O
+ O
sorry O
to O
write O
it O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
happiness O
of O
kindness. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
did O
not O
leave O
me O
a O
memorable O
memory O
(a O
delicious O
tea). O

Maybe O
better, O
I'm O
sure O
of O
it! O

A O
must-have! O

A O
fresh O
and O
fine O
cuisine, B-TARGET
with O
very O
good O
products, B-TARGET
cooked O
with O
talent O
and O
love. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
always O
perfect, O
a O
very O
good O
choice O
of O
wine B-TARGET
(even O
the O
pichets B-TARGET
are O
very O
good), O
of O
aperitifs B-TARGET
and O
especially O
to O
test O
the O
coktails!! B-TARGET

Invented O
and O
carefully O
prepared O
by O
the O
super O
bartender!! O

Between O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
summer O
and O
the O
tables O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
fireplace B-TARGET
in O
winter, O
music, B-TARGET
the O
setting B-TARGET
brings O
together O
all O
the O
ingredients O
to O
spend O
a O
superb O
evening. O

Close O
your O
eyes! O

Reading O
the O
various O
praiseworthy O
comments, O
I O
wondered O
a O
little O
if O
I O
was O
in O
the O
same O
place B-TARGET
or O
if O
I O
was O
in O
a O
bad O
mood O
that O
day... O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
does O
not O
leave O
any O
special O
memories, O
rather O
standard O
and O
for O
the O
price O
at O
the O
end, O
you O
can O
honestly O
expect O
much O
better! O

In O
short, O
it O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
what O
I O
was O
told O
about O
it O
or O
what O
I O
could O
read O
about O
this O
restaurant... B-TARGET

Tastes O
and O
colours O
no O
doubt O
:-) O

We O
were O
5 O
today O
wanting O
to O
eat O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
this O
establishment, O
with O
its O
great O
choice O
the O
card B-TARGET
is O
suitable O
for O
everyone. O

Once O
we O
are O
ready O
we O
have O
to O
wait O
15mn O
to O
order O
our O
beverages O
and O
have O
the O
cards, O
15 O
mn O
later O
the O
server O
comes O
back O
to O
take O
our O
order O
it O
is O
what O
he O
tells O
us O
that O
there O
are O
neither O
pizzas O
nor O
hamburgers O
nor O
cannelonis... O

If O
it O
had O
been O
communicating O
to O
us O
by O
installing O
us O
we O
would O
have O
decided O
to O
change O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
have O
to O
take O
the O
olives O
left O
by O
the O
customers O
of O
the O
table O
of O
a O
rating O
(with O
the O
nuclei O
on O
the O
table O
that O
have O
not O
been O
picked O
up O
during O
our O
wait) O
I O
ask O
for O
a O
timetable O
to O
put O
our O
nuclei O
there O
the O
server B-TARGET
says O
to O
me O
"you O
ask O
for O
things O
you" O

As O
we O
were O
drinking O
our O
consumption O
we O
decided O
to O
make O
an O
effort O
by O
ordering O
all O
a O
meat, O
not O
seeing O
the O
server B-TARGET
come O
back O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
10 O
mn O
we O
were O
dragged O
to O
go O
regulate O
the O
note O
in O
the O
tobacco O
office O
after O
having O
to O
wait O
because O
1 O
only O
cash O
the O
boss B-TARGET
asks O
me O
for O
a O
nice O
average O
factor O
the O
table O
number. O

" O
we O
can't O
pay O
without O
the O
table O
number, O
I O
need O
the O
table O
number O
" O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
"montagnard" O
setting, B-TARGET
however O
it O
is O
true O
that O
the O
smell B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
unpleasant O
when O
you O
come O
back O
to O
the O
room. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
we O
sleep O
in O
a O
fondue O
restaurant, O
so O
no O
surprises O
on O
this O
point O
la. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
very O
kind O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
client. O

A O
small O
bemol O
for O
a O
lady O
who O
was O
part O
of O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
who O
was O
no O
less O
unpleasant. O

This O
still O
remains O
a O
good O
rest, B-TARGET
to O
test. O

Already O
on O
arrival, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
exceptional! O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
at O
the O
bottom O
left O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
3 O
meters O
from O
the O
sea; O
the O
beach O
is O
on O
the O
right O
side O
(on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
restaurant O
room) O
so O
we O
are O
not O
"disturbed" O
by O
plagiarists. O

As O
for O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
it O
is O
delicate, O
refined O
and O
in O
generous O
portions! O

Daily O
arrivals O
of O
fish, B-TARGET
thus O
extra O
free. O

For O
those O
who O
do O
not O
like O
fish, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
varied; O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
very O
delicious!!! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
relaxing, O
the O
server B-TARGET
makes O
you O
comfortable O
right O
away. O

Although O
not O
everything O
is O
given, O
a O
dish O
and O
dessert O
remain O
affordable. O

Quality O
meals B-TARGET
with O
very O
correct O
catches. O

Fresh O
products B-TARGET
with O
good O
positions O
of O
the O
team B-TARGET
who O
is O
on O
the O
small O
care. O

The O
small O
plus O
a O
map B-TARGET
of O
has O
very O
attractive O
catches. O

An O
excellent O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
home-made O
dishes, B-TARGET
which O
makes O
a O
reduced O
card B-TARGET
but O
with O
dishes O
with O
an O
exquisite O
taste. O

I O
can O
only O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
excellent O
hospitality B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
cuisine. B-TARGET

A O
bitch B-TARGET
like O
I O
love O
them. O

Here O
you O
have O
been O
properly O
received. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
simple O
but O
of O
very O
good O
quality. O

Very O
nice O
service B-TARGET
on O
a O
nice O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
tourist O
is O
welcome O
and O
here O
not O
of O
arnake. O

Prices O
are O
reasonable O
and O
do O
not O
force O
consumption. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
note O
on O
your O
trips O
to O
Marseille. O

The O
proximity O
to O
parking O
will O
make O
your O
stay O
cooler. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
define O
the O
framework B-TARGET
already, O
I O
would O
say O
bluffing. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
sublime, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
quiet. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
fine, O
perfectly O
adapted O
in O
quantity. O

The O
hotel O
was O
very O
quiet O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

However, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
remained O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
wait B-TARGET
was O
not O
excessive O
(except O
for O
the O
aperitif, O
therefore). O

We O
were O
used O
to O
this O
guinguette O
restaurant B-TARGET
which O
was O
at O
the O
time O
very O
pleasant O
with O
a O
beautiful O
view B-TARGET
of O
the O
old O
harbour O
and O
with O
unpretentious O
food B-TARGET
with O
good O
simple O
and O
fresh O
products.... B-TARGET

But O
that O
it O
has O
passed, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
become O
a O
very O
expensive O
tourist O
attraction O
without O
any O
quality!!! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

We O
are O
very O
sad O
and O
very O
disappointed.. O
we O
were O
with O
Marseillais O
who O
also O
found O
it O
very O
bad, O
one O
of O
our O
friends O
was O
even O
sick O
all O
night O
after O
dinner.. O

We O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there. O

It's O
really O
awful!! O

Restaurant O
visited O
one O
night O
a O
week O
with O
reservation. O

Typical O
Moroccan O
cuisine, B-TARGET
simple O
map B-TARGET
with O
all O
the O
dishes O
of O
the O
country. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
ready O
to O
make O
everyone O
eat. O

A O
plate B-TARGET
(very O
copied, O
and O
served O
if O
needed) O
with O
mint O
tea O
to O
digest: O
12€ O

Do O
not O
miss O
out O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
flavors O
without O
breaking O
your O
wallet! O

No O
mistakes O
in O
this O
rest... B-TARGET

Starting O
with O
the O
warm O
and O
very O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
(we O
accept O
at O
14 O
on O
November O
1st...beaucoup O
would O
not O
have O
done O
it) O

A O
simple O
but O
yet O
very O
authentic O
and O
studied O
framework... B-TARGET
an O
American O
style O
of O
the O
1970s O
with O
simplicity O
and O
taste. O

The O
heart...the O
meal! B-TARGET

The O
hotel B-TARGET
is O
located O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
city, O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
city O
centre O
and O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
city O
centre. O

I O
recommend O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
turtle I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Thailand. I-TARGET

Then O
the O
dishes... O
no O
doubt O
the O
specialty O
very O
carefully O
crafted O
is O
the O
homemade O
burger! B-TARGET

A O
bread B-TARGET
made O
by O
a O
baker O
in O
the O
area, O
a O
fresh O
hacked B-TARGET
steak, I-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
fresh B-TARGET
products, I-TARGET
homemade O
fries, B-TARGET
the O
small O
salad B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
a O
well O
raised O
vinegar. O

Don't O
be O
afraid O
of O
words...to O
date O
it's O
the O
best O
burger B-TARGET
I've O
eaten. O

Even O
though O
it's O
a O
fashionable O
concept... O
few O
people O
like O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
to O
fall O
with O
the O
cheesecake B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
Toblerone! I-TARGET

All O
at O
a O
very O
measured O
angle. O

Entrance/dish/ B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
at O
2 O
for O
40 O
euros O

We O
had O
lunch O
yesterday O
in O
this O
restaurant O
with O
sea O
view B-TARGET
and O
very O
nice O
terrace. B-TARGET

We O
were O
welcomed O
on O
the O
terrace, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
that O
I O
had O
ordered O
blue O
cooking O
arrived O
"saignante", O
not O
terrible O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
specialized O
in O
meat! O

But O
good O
to O
not O
make O
it O
difficult, O
I O
eat O
it O
anyway O
without O
getting O
it O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
and O
wasting O
it. O

When O
the O
server O
asked O
us O
if O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be, O
I O
told O
him O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
the O
cooking O
was O
not O
the O
one O
I O
had O
asked. O

And O
there, O
what O
a O
surprise O
the O
server B-TARGET
wakes O
up, O
it O
is O
not O
comprehensible, O
it O
brings O
us O
the O
addition, O
we O
regulate O
and O
it O
doesn't O
even O
tell O
us O
to O
say O
goodbye!!! O
What O
professionalism!!!! O
seeing O
his O
behaviour O
and O
his O
young O
age, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
maturity, O
manager O
there O
is O
an O
emergency! O

With O
this O
welcome, B-TARGET
we O
will O
not O
come O
back! O

Restaurant O
visited O
for O
family O
occasions. O

Very O
good O
reception, B-TARGET
discreet O
and O
effective. O

Good O
food, B-TARGET
refined, O
in O
a O
good O
timing. B-TARGET

A O
beautiful O
and O
great O
classic, B-TARGET
which O
will O
not O
disappoint, O
whatever O
tastes, O
big O
and O
small. O

Good O
room B-TARGET
well O
valued O
by O
good O
advice O
in O
the O
room. O

Together O
a O
little O
expensive O
for O
those O
who O
make O
jump O
a O
few O
consecutive O
bottles... O

Quality/price O
ratio O
acceptable. O

Unpleasantly O
tasty, O
microwave-heated O
dishes! B-TARGET

A O
cold O
welcome! B-TARGET

And O
to O
win O
everything O
the O
cockroaches O
were O
invited O
to O
our O
table! O

We O
were O
sick! O

This O
facility B-TARGET
should O
be O
closed! O

A O
noisy O
canteen O
without O
any O
other O
charm O
than O
that, O
a O
bit O
ringard, O
of O
untouched O
photos O
of O
the O
"people" O
who O
visited O
the O
places O
one O
day. O

And O
then O
finally, O
what O
is O
this O
story O
of O
not O
presenting O
cards O
to O
customers O
in O
2013? O

Reputation O
surfaite O
for O
an O
address B-TARGET
that O
surfs O
on O
the O
mode O
that O
carries O
the O
neighborhood. O

When O
Marseille's O
institutions O
lose O
their O
reputation, O
they O
are O
only O
visited O
by O
tourists. O

The O
Marseilles, O
too, O
rely O
on O
the O
new O
addresses O
opened O
by O
newcomers O
to O
the O
city... O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
exceptional, O
nothing O
like O
that, O
it's O
worth O
it. O

On O
Boullabaisse, B-TARGET
you O
will O
be O
presented O
with O
a O
huge O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
before O
cooking. O

But O
they O
had O
to O
shrink O
at O
the O
cooking, O
2 O
pieces O
full O
of O
cubes, O
huge O
onions, O
a O
little O
juice... O

We O
keep O
on O
hungry, O
we O
repay O
for O
it, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
rabbi. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
bottles B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
do O
not O
wait O
to O
be O
replaced, O
and O
there, O
the O
addition O
is O
more O
than O
salt. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
tourists O
are O
relieving O
themselves O
of O
the O
portfolio. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
if O
you O
like O
the O
dark O
light, O
are O
students O
or O
bobo/hipster. O

Arrive O
early O
because O
it O
fills O
up O
quickly. O

Affordable O
tapas, B-TARGET
except O
for O
the O
manchego B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
(five O
thin O
slices O
for O
5€) O
and O
the O
serrano B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
(6 O
slices O
for O
10€). O

The O
matronne B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
it O
adds O
to O
the O
convenience O
to O
everything. O

Not O
the O
best O
coffee B-TARGET
I've O
eaten, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
we O
don't O
complain. O

The O
food O
arrives O
quickly. O

Avoid B-TARGET
going I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
large I-TARGET
groups, I-TARGET
six O
people O
is O
already O
a O
lot. O

PIZZA B-TARGET
is O
so O
fine O
that O
it O
is O
irresistible: O
you O
have O
to O
break O
it. O

Cheese B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
delicious O
coffees B-TARGET
at O
9 O
€, O
dusty O
setting, B-TARGET
unprofessional O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
quickly O
the O
score O
reaches O
40 O
€ O
for O
bad B-TARGET
eating. I-TARGET

In O
short, O
the O
environment O
of O
the O
site B-TARGET
does O
not O
justify O
the O
move O
to O
this O
"restaurant" B-TARGET
which O
one O
wonders O
if O
the O
tenants O
have O
learned O
to O
cook O
and O
know O
what O
a O
business O
is. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

The O
beef B-TARGET
is O
of O
fantastic O
quality, O
the O
wines B-TARGET
many O
esr O
available O
in O
the O
glass, O
the O
tartan B-TARGET
is O
not O
terrible O
because O
too O
much O
must O
in O
the O
mixture... O
besides O
the O
must O
in O
the O
tartan... O
bizarre. O

Otherwise O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
nice O
to O
six O
steps O
from O
the O
god B-TARGET
side. I-TARGET

Well, O
there O
is O
better. O

That O
the O
chief O
seeks O
to O
recreate O
the O
classics B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Lyon, I-TARGET
why O
not O
if O
he O
does O
so O
with O
talent. O

Unfortunately, O
this O
menu B-TARGET
with O
typical O
Lyonian O
accents O
is O
not O
only O
bad O
but O
at O
the O
limit O
of O
grotesque. O

In O
addition, O
(1) O
the O
room B-TARGET
would O
be O
cooled, O
(2) O
the O
boss B-TARGET
should O
learn O
to O
smile, O
and O
(3) O
the O
prices O
are O
delicious O
considering O
the O
poor O
cuisine B-TARGET
we O
were O
served. O

We O
should O
have O
paid O
as O
much O
as O
25 O
euros O
per O
person O
for O
such O
a O
poor O
meal, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
at O
this O
order O
of O
prices O
there O
is O
much O
better O
in O
Lyon O
and O
at O
the O
prohibitive O
prices O
it O
practices, O
there O
is O
also O
much O
better O
in O
Lyon O
and O
especially O
in O
the O
surrounding O
area, O
including O
stars O
worthy O
of O
that O
name! O

Second O
passage O
in O
this O
small O
Lyonese O
restaurant. O

What O
a O
disappointment! O

Poor, O
tasteless O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
we O
found O
ourselves O
starving! O

It's O
a O
shame! O

290€ O
for O
4 O
people, O
with O
a O
homemade O
aperitif, O
a O
coca, O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine... O

The O
rating O
is O
salted O
and O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
what O
is O
happening O
on O
the O
table! B-TARGET

Very O
good, O
for O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
has O
been O
on O
the O
spot O
for O
a O
long O
time O
in O
Saint O
Etienne. O

We O
have O
wanted O
to O
do O
so O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
we O
will O
not O
go O
back O
and O
we O
do O
not O
want O
to O
do O
so. O

In O
the O
desert O
room, B-TARGET
we O
were O
6 O
in O
total, O
a O
Saturday O
evening... O

Menu O
Large O
Gourmand, O
2 O
seats, O
4 O
€ O
extra O
for O
cheese... B-TARGET

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
despite O
everything. O

It O
was O
delicious, O
but O
a O
better O
taste O
was O
expected. O

Quality/price O
ratio O
acceptable. O

The B-TARGET
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

Whether O
at O
the O
counter O
or O
drive, O
the O
wait B-TARGET
is O
long. O

Hot O
products B-TARGET
are O
supplied O
cold O
(frozen,...) O
and O
there O
is O
always O
a O
lack O
of O
order O
elements O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
recurrent O
forgetting O
of O
sauces, O
packages O
and O
napkins. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
leaves O
to O
be O
desired O
for O
this O
great O
sign. O

Great O
reception B-TARGET
and O
very O
well O
informed O
cadre O
on O
the O
South O
American O
specialties!!!!! O

Nice O
cocktail B-TARGET
very O
good O
to O
eat O
to O
remake O
as O
soon O
as O
possible!!!!! O

I O
have O
known O
this O
restaurant O
for O
many O
years O
to O
bring O
customers. O

For O
almost O
ten O
years O
I O
hadn't O
come O
back O
and O
I'm O
looking O
back O
this O
year O
and O
not O
too O
disappointed O
though... O
as O
I O
expected O
to O
find O
a O
temple O
of O
gastronomy, O
the O
bar O
was O
a O
bit O
high. O

However, O
the O
quality O
is O
always O
at O
your O
disposal, O
the O
prices O
too... O
but O
the O
quality O
has O
a O
price O
and O
when O
it O
is O
very O
good O
and O
tasty O
it O
is O
never O
too O
expensive. O

A O
bit O
isolated O
on O
this O
J O
Janin O
boulevard O
but O
parking O
is O
still O
possible O
without O
going O
too O
far. O

Therefore, O
to O
advise O

I've O
been O
eating O
low O
for O
years O
and O
I've O
brought O
back O
many O
customers... O

I O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
which O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
kebab O
of O
mulhouse. O

Delicious O
white B-TARGET
sauce!!!! I-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
pleasant. O

We O
had O
dinner O
on O
Sunday O
evening, O
good O
fresh O
meals B-TARGET
nothing O
exceptional O
but O
pleasant! O

Nice O
service! B-TARGET

A O
good O
Thai! B-TARGET

The O
staff O
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

I O
would O

back O

Unfortunately, O
on O
3 O
servers, B-TARGET
only O
1 O
of O
them O
said O
hello O
to O
us, O
the O
servers O
are O
on O
their O
phone O
behind O
the O
bar, O
whispering O
amongst O
themselves, O
being O
clearly O
noisy. O

The O
worst O
is O
the O
toilets. O

A O
catastrophe, O
all O
the O
toilets O
are O
full O
of O
feces, O
more O
toilet O
paper, O
toilets O
are O
staff-sized.... B-TARGET

To O
avoid O
absolutely, O
put O
your O
legs O
on O
your O
neck. O

Nice O
hotel, B-TARGET
nice O
place, B-TARGET
nice O
map! B-TARGET

All O
burgers B-TARGET
are O
delicious. O

Some O
concerns O
about O
stock O
management, O
several O
unused O

Thanks O
for O
a O
Saturday O
evening! O

several O

restaurant B-TARGET

A O
chain B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
we O
pushed O
the O
door O
because O
in O
general, O
without O
being O
extraordinary O
it O
is O
a O
value O
on, O
not O
too O
expensive O
and O
fast. O

Not O
here, O
approximate O
cleanliness, O
complicated O
at O
the O
level O
of O
service, B-TARGET
when O
to O
pizza, B-TARGET
no. O

No O
chance O
that O
day O
or O
real O
lack O
of O
quality? O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back... O

The O
staff O
were O
very O
friendly B-TARGET
and O
helpful. O

The O
seats O
are O
very O
comfortable O
and O
the O
frame B-TARGET
is O
cleaned. O

A O
25€ O
menu B-TARGET
can O
allow O
you O
to O
eat O
well O
without O
ruining O
yourself O
too O
much O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
on O
the O

are O
very O
copied O
as O
well. O

Cook O
the O

Recommend O
to O
keep O
your O
eyes O
closed! O

I O
have O
eaten O
in O
this O
Resto O
for O
the O
2nd O
time O
today. O

Friday, O
a O
burger. O

It's O
just O
the O
best O
I've O
ever O
eaten! O

Good, O
organic, O
perfect O
cooking, O
warm, O
fragrant O
and O
slightly O
spicy! O

Today, O
a O
freshly O
cooked O
beef O
with O
vegetables.. O

Everything O
corresponds O
100% O
to O
my O
tastes O
and O
expectations. O

Breakfast O
was O
excellent, O
the O
room O
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

In O
addition, O
everything O
was O
served O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
waiter! B-TARGET

What O
more O
to O
ask O
for! O

Located O
in O
a O
small O
street O
of O
the O
old O
centre O
of O
Gap, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
well O
decorated. O

One O
could O
almost O
believe O
in O
Britain. O

The O
small O
card B-TARGET
is O
very O
delicious... O
unfortunately O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
by O
the O
cards, B-TARGET
not O
very O
large, O
not O
very O
delicious, O
not O
very O
loaded... O

I O
am O
a O
gourmet. O

The O
cider B-TARGET
is O
good... O

And O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
are O
EXCELLENT O
(the O
pate B-TARGET
and O
the O
accompanying B-TARGET
). O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
pro. O

There O
is O
not O
much O
missing O
from O
this O
address B-TARGET
so O
I O
would O
be O
happy O
to O
return O
there. O

It's O
the O
best O
pizza O
from O
Gap O
and O
even O
from O
France.... O
Ask O
Chris O
for O
the O
"like O
DAB"... O

A O
mixture O
of O
everything O
with O
fresh O
cream O
on O
top, O
all O
on O
a O
delicious O
and O
perfectly O
cooked O
pasta... B-TARGET

This, O
really O
is O
the O
opposite.... O

If O
you O
don't O
have O
the O
time, O
ask O
for O
it..... O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
among O
friends. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
speak O
without O
crying O
because O
of O
the O
noise. O

The O
music B-TARGET
was O
really O
very O
strong. O

Extremely O
negative: O
at O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
gives O
us O
the O
addition O
without O
asking O
for O
it. O

And O
we O
say O
text: O
if O
you O
want O
coffee O
or O
digestion O
c'eSt O
in O
5 O
min O
Max O
at O
the O

I O
have O
reserved O
a O
table O
at O
21h O
not O
from O
21h O
to O
22h!!! O
I O
find O
this O
very O
mediocre. O

I O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
there. O

It O
fully O
respects O
its O
name O
as O
a O
mountain O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Very O
copied O
dishes, B-TARGET
products B-TARGET
from O
the O
ground O
floor O
as O
well O
as O
impeccable O
service B-TARGET
immersed O
in O
a O
very O
good O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Another O
positive O
point O
is O
the O
very O
reasonable O
cost. O

Go O
there O
with O
confidence O
if O
you O
want O
a O
simple, O
honest O
and O
generous O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Nice O
frame B-TARGET
and O
formula B-TARGET
for O
two O
well O
served O
with O
good O
products! B-TARGET

A O
nice O
mountain O
map B-TARGET
as O
well, O
and O
excellent O
ice B-TARGET
to O
taste O
in O
summer O
in O
the O
small O
garden B-TARGET
behind O
the O
restaurant. O

It O
was O
just O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
back O
with O
a O
great O
memory. O

By O
8 O
o'clock O
there O
was O
only O
one O
2 O
table O
occupied O
believing O
that O
people O
were O
better O
informed. O

We O
all O
took O
the O
menu O
at O
29, O
being O
good O
eaters O
it O
looked O
very O
relaxing. O

The O
result O
of O
the O
sachet O
salad B-TARGET
with O
a O
ridiculous O
cheese B-TARGET
toast I-TARGET
on O
a O
large O
piece O
of O
my O
bread O
and O
catastrophic O
dishes... B-TARGET

No O
accompaniment O
noted O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
was O
served O
we O
had O
frozen O
fries B-TARGET
thrown O
on O
our O
meats B-TARGET
to O
hide O
the O
misery O
and O
grilled O
beans B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
had O
fish. O

And O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
disaster O
continues. O

In O
short, O
we O
pointed O
this O
out O
to O
the O
waiter O
who O
told O
us O
to O
be O
so O
much O
in O
agreement O
that O
we O
had O
the O
menu O
changed O
in O
the O
morning O
in O
the O
kitchen O
but O
not O
on O
paper. O

29 O
euros O
is O
expensive O
for O
frozen O
and O
garbage. B-TARGET

We O
went O
there O
twice O
in O
15 O
days O
and O
before O
varied O
the O
selected O
dishes. O

As O
a O
result, O
everything O
is O
very O
good, O
with O
special O
mention O
of O
the O
raviolis B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
the O
pintade B-TARGET
on O
the O
plate. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
a O
bit O
lower. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
warm. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
there! O

To O
avoid... O

Salad B-TARGET
in O
the O
correct O
entry O
and O
then O
what O
a O
disappointment O
for O
the O
tartare! B-TARGET

This O
one O
was O
for O
me O
of O
raw O
meat O
covered O
with O
ketchup. O

I O
am O
not O
talking O
about O
accompaniments! B-TARGET

It O
was O
a O
pity O
that O
my O
opinion O
was O
not O
heard O
during O
the O
meal. O

No O
proposals O
for O
change O
or O
commercial O
action. O

Together O
with O
my O
wife, O
who O
is O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
Asian O
restaurants, O
we O
were O
very O
disappointed. O

The O
nems B-TARGET
are O
right, O
the O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
small O
(we O
came O
out O
having O
barely O
enough O
eaten), O
the O
croust B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
is O
not O
and O
falls O
in O
the O
fat. O

The O
prices O
are O
quite O
high O
for O
what O
we O
have O
eaten. O

We O
are O
not O
talking O
about O
the O
forced O
smile O
of O
the O
maid, B-TARGET
but O
we O
were O
warned O
about O
this. O

We O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there! O

Symphatic O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
good O
pizzas B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
salads B-TARGET
terrace B-TARGET
and O
only O
incoven O
a O
staircase O
to O
climb O
if O
there O
is O
no O
place O
down O

At O
200m O
from O
my O
home, O
whenever O
I O
want O
a O
pizza O
I O
go O
down O
there. O

The O
smell O
is O
already O
soothing O
when O
you O
walk O
in O
front O
of O
it. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
really O
nice O
and O
I O
even O
got O
a O
free O
pizza O
without O
asking O
anything. O

The O
bressane B-TARGET
is O
my O
favorite. O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
well O
kept. O

Continue O
as O
it O
is O
happy! O

Price O
is O
a O
bit O
high O
at O
the O
card B-TARGET
except O
for O
the O
day B-TARGET
formula. I-TARGET

Good O
kitchen, B-TARGET
a O
small O
bemol O
for O
service. B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
you O
have O
the O
embarrassment O
of O
choosing O
to O
sit O
down. O

It O
is O
permanently O
empty, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
decorative O
street O
window... O

We O
are O
welcomed O
by O
the O
owner, B-TARGET
great O
smile. O

The O
deco B-TARGET
is O
low-end O
and O
clinching. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
typical, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
offers O
a O
lot O
of O
choice. O

Therefore, O
one O
wonders O
how O
to O
serve O
fresh O
products O
with O
so O
little O
attendance O
and O
such O
a O
card. O

I O
wonder. O

An O
oasis O
of O
calm, O
where O
you O
have O
to O
chuckle O
to O
talk O
because O
it O
resonates: O
everything O
is O
empty! O

The O
prices O
applied O
are O
correct. O

A O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
nice O
exterior O
and O
a O
good O
location, O
which O
made O
us O
want O
to O
eat O
there. O

From O
the O
entrance O
the O
reception B-TARGET
of O
the O
server O
was O
quite O
cold. O

Arrive O
the O
dishes, O
for O
my O
part O
a O
fillet B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
vivaneau I-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Vietnamese I-TARGET
(just O
covered O
with O
a O
hot O
sweet O
chili O
sauce B-TARGET
industrial) O
and O
accompanied O
by O
sauté B-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
(in O
the O
water...) O
which O
is O
additional O
to O
6€. O

Total O
22€ O
the O
fish, B-TARGET
scandalous! O

The O
other O
two O
guests O
took O
a O
bo B-TARGET
bun I-TARGET
composed O
of O
a O
poor O
nem O
cut O
in O
4, O
salad, O
vermicelli O
and O
beef B-TARGET
that O
I O
will O
not O
even O
give O
to O
my O
dog. O

And O
to O
conclude O
the O
only O
answer O
from O
the O
boss B-TARGET
"maybe O
you O
have O
the O
taste O
of O
someone O
who O
eats O
fast O
food". O

Scandalous!!!! O

In O
the O
city O
centre, O
La O
Bourdonnais O
Street, O
it O
is O
not O
obvious O
to O
park O
at O
midday O
during O
the O
week. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
big, O
with O
a O
floor O
and O
a O
steep O
staircase. O

If O
the O
reservation O
is O
specified O
at O
RDC O
or O
floor O
to O
avoid O
surprises. O

We O
waited O
a O
little O
while O
for O
our O
order O
to O
be O
taken. O

At O
midday, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
simple, O
you O
have O
the O
choice O
between O
3 O
entrances, O
3 O
main O
dishes O
and O
3 O
desserts, O
except O
that O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
choice O
was O
no O
longer O
the O
choice O
but O
a O
single O
type O
of O
dessert. O

It's O
a O
little O
limited. O

Apparently O
the O
card O
must O
change O
from O
time O
to O
time. O

I O
chose O
a O
chouchou O
gratin O
with O
a O
small O
salad B-TARGET
over-scrambled. O

The O
fish, B-TARGET
a O
little O
hard, O
without O
too O
much O
taste, O
and O
of O
just O
quantity O
with O
a O
good O
presentation O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
fast. O

The O
fruit B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
dessert, O
correct. O

So, O
it's O
a O
banal O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
doesn't O
leave O
me O
an O
imprintable O
memory. O

Excellent O
pizzas! B-TARGET

Good O
stored, O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
they O
are O
not O
smelly. O

Very O
fast O
:) O

At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
aperture O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
well O
located O
on O
the O
cathedral O
square. O

Appreciation, B-TARGET
good O
service. B-TARGET

Arriving O
at O
lunch O
time O
is O
better O
to O
change O
address. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were I-TARGET
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

Damage O
to O
the O
view O
of O
creative O
ideas. O

The O
fleet: O
refuse O
blue O
cards O
for O
weekends O
without O
an O
announcement! O

Scandal O

The O
hotel B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice O
and O
very O
good O
grillades. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
staff O
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

A O
good O
reference O
to O
Kourou. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
there O
is O
no O
terrace. O

It O
was O
my O
first O
lunch O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

However, O
I O
didn't O
taste O
the O
pizzas O
;-) O

Poor O
food. B-TARGET

High O
price O
for O
the O
service O
and O
especially O
the O
sharpness O
leaves O
to O
be O
desired O
in O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
had O
lunch O
surrounded O
by O
a O
mosquito O
in O
an O
air-conditioned O
room. O

When O
we O
commented O
on O
it O
to O
the O
server, B-TARGET
as O
a O
response O
we O
were O
entitled O
to O
a O
cynical O
comment. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
needs O
to O
recover O
quickly. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

We O
regularly O
dine O
there O
in O
groups. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
very O
fresh, O
the O
copieous O
portions, B-TARGET
the O
accompanying B-TARGET
sauces I-TARGET
and O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
are O
original O
and O
very O
good. O

A O
very O
good O
address, B-TARGET
in O
the O
kind O

On O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
Royal O
Island, O
the O
main O
island O
of O
the O
Salut O
Islands O
off O
the O
coast O
of O
Kourou, O
we O
took O
advantage O
of O
the O
opportunity O
to O
dine O
at O
the O
only O
restaurant O
on O
site. O

Although O
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
courteous, O
the O
services O
suffer O
from O
monopoly. O

Unsweetened O
drinks, O
limited O
choices, O
we O
move O
to O
find O
a O
server, O
we O
wait O
for O
him O
to O
take O
care O
of O
you... O
e.g. O
a O
customer O
is O
going O
to O
ask O
if O
we O
could O
do O
something O
for O
the O
insect O
in O
his O
plate, O
and O
well O
no, O
if O
he O
heard, O
it's O
not O
our O
fault, O
we O
can't O
do O
anything... O
exceptional O
service, B-TARGET
if O
we O
judge O
it O
by O
this O
fact O
different! O

However, O
there O
are O
few O
things O
that O
will O
make O
this O
place B-TARGET
an O
exceptional O
place, O
because O
the O
site B-TARGET
is O
magical O
and O
full O
of O
history. O

We O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
on O
a O
Sunday O
evening. O

We O
took O
the O
menu O
at O
29,90€. O

Entrance: O
Saint B-TARGET
Jacques I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
medium O
quality O
brooches. O

We O
don't O
change O
the O
covers... O

Plate: O
a O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
grilled I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
(not O
very O
tender), O
without O
sauce, O
with O
carrot B-TARGET
purée I-TARGET
(very O
good), O
broccoli O
and O
potatoes B-TARGET
not O
cooked O
in O
the O
middle. O

We O
made O
the O
remark O
to O
the O
waiter O
who O
passed O
it O
on O
to O
the O
cook. O

We've O
heard O
him O
say O
from O
the O
kitchen O
that O
if O
you're O
not O
happy O
you O
just O
have O
to O
eat O
them O
in O
purée!... O

Dessert: O
2 B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
mousse, I-TARGET
good O
but O
much O
too O
succulent. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
the O
toilets O
are O
not O
upright. O

The O
hotel O
also O
has O
a O
lovely O
terrace. B-TARGET

In O
short, O
a O
poor O
chef, B-TARGET
a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
may O
be O
organic O
but O
not O
gastronomic O
(you O
can O
eat O
organic O
without O
necessarily O
being O
on O
a O
diet...), O
all O
at O
too O
high O
a O
price. O

A B-TARGET
good I-TARGET
frame I-TARGET
but O
aside O
from O
that??? O

a O
card B-TARGET

We O
come O
to O
this O
restaurant O
quite O
regularly, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
original O
and O
well O
presented O
but O
since O
the O
boss O
is O
the O
only O
one O
serving O
it O
is O
often O
that O
the O
dishes O
are O
extracted O
which O

A O
small O
family O
meal. O

I O
have O
already O
visited O
a O

years O

a O
very O
good O
memory O
that O
has O
been O
confirmed O
again! O

Nice O
room. B-TARGET

Fast O
and O
courteous O
service. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
day I-TARGET
was O
easy, O
I O
chose O
to O
go O
back. O

I O
take O
the O
form O
" O
entrance O
- O
day O
meal O
for O
12€50." O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful. O

It O
is O
replaced O
by O
another O
with O
my O
agreement. O

The O
sauce O
invaded O
the O
fish. B-TARGET

No O
taste. O

The O
addition O
was O
no O
longer O
the O
same. O

I O
did O
not O
say O
anything. O

Anyway, O
I O
won't O
go O
back O
there O
because O
it's O
not O
good..... O

8€50 O
for O
a O

2 O
olives, O
a O
piece O
of O
tomato O
nuts O
in O
a O
salad O
that O
boils O
in O
oil. O

That O
is O
outrageous. O

I O
strongly O
discourage O
it. O

food O
problems O
before O
meals! B-TARGET

I O
have O
repeated O
the O
experience O
several O
times O
but O
it's O
finished O
I O
won't O
go O
again!!!!!!!! O

So O
here, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
classy O
restaurant, O
a O
very O
careful O
and O
refined O
cuisine B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday, O
or O
a O
great O
occasion, O
this O
is O
the O
place B-TARGET
IDEAL! O

Very O
good O
room B-TARGET
with O
good O
advice O
and O
reasonable O
prices. O

Thank O
you O

The O
friends O
wanted O
to O
eat O
pancakes O
but... O
impossible O
to O
get O
accepted O
in O
those O
we O
had O
been O
recommended: O
we O
found O
ourselves O
at O
the O
tch'ti O
who O
are O
not O
specialists O
in O
galettes O
and O
pancakes. O

For O
lovers O
of O
beer, O
charcuterie O
fries O
and O
generous O
portions B-TARGET
you O
will O
be O
all O
the O
more O
delighted O
that O
the O
addition O
is O
light. O

When O
we O
returned O
to O
the O
establishment, B-TARGET
we O
felt O
a O
lot O
of O
stress O
surrounding O
the O
employees... O

At O
the O
same O
time O
not O
surprising: O
the O
boss B-TARGET
is O
as O
kind O
as O
a O
prison O
door... O

He O
directs O
his O
employees O
to O
clapping O
fingers... O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
cooking, B-TARGET
it O
was O
good O
but O
no O
more: O
pieces O
of O
fat O
in O
chili, B-TARGET
cooking O
meats B-TARGET
that O
were O
not O
well O
cooked, O
no O
almonds O
on O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
when O
he O
had O
to O
have O
them... O

The O
map, B-TARGET
however, O
is O
well O
maintained O
and O
comfortable. O

Ah O
yes! O

I O
forgot O
restaurant O
very O
noisy, O
we O
had O
difficulty O
to O
get O
along... O

the O
restaurant O
room B-TARGET
is O
canteen, O
the O
déco B-TARGET
is O
sad, O
since O
at O
dinner O
our O
snack B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
tender, O

average O
restaurant B-TARGET
I O
would O
avoid O
