A O
passable O
service.. B-TARGET
overcooked O
dishes, B-TARGET
sauces B-TARGET
fixed O
in O
their O
pots O
(we O
wonder O
if O
they O
weren't O
on O
other O
tables O
before O
we O
were O
served), O
the O
price O
is O
correct O
but O
the O
taste O
is O
not O
at O
make O
you... O
very O
disappointed O
by O
this O
rest B-TARGET

We O
liked O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
on O
the O
main O
promenade B-TARGET
of O
Narbonne-Plage, O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service. B-TARGET

We O
will O
come O
back! O

It O
was O
expected O
to O
be O
better O
(average O
quality). O

Not O
bad, O
but O
no O
more. O

We O
do O
not O
think O
to O
go O
back. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
keep O
for O
yourself O
stunning O
views B-TARGET
on O
the O
hippodrome O
and O
golf O
think O
to O
book O
down O
near O
the O
windows O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
good O
and O
in O
addition O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
with O
a O
smile O

A O
little O
lady O
welcomes O
us O
without O
a O
smile O
but O
especially O
without O
enthusiasm, O
it O
must O
have O
annoyed O
her O
having O
clients O
on O
a O
Tuesday O
evening.... O
3 O
tables. O

So O
let’s O
pass... O

However, O
we O
ordered O
pasta O
lasagnes, B-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
unflavored O
cheese B-TARGET
on O
top, O
which O
mitigated O
the O
acidity O
of O
the O
tomato B-TARGET
concentrate...! I-TARGET

All O
dessert B-TARGET
except O
for O
home. O

I O
really O
do O
not O
recommend, O
even O
if O
your O
refrigerator O
is O
empty O
and O
the O
others O
left O
next O
door O
are O
full O
and O
you O
don’t O
know O
where O
to O
go..... O

It’s O
even O
better O
to O
go O
to O
McDonalds. O

Really O
pleasantly O
surprised! O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
well O
served. O

It’s O
always O
very O
original, O
you O
can O
taste O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
you O
won’t O
see O
anywhere O
else. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
table I-TARGET
really O
gives O
you O
desire, O
you O
cut O
a O
good O
portion O
of O
gourmet B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
or O
fresh, O
homemade O
cake! B-TARGET

It O
feels O
like O
home O
with O
good O
quality. O

The O
team B-TARGET
is O
adorable! O

Go O
to O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
which O
is O
very O
beautiful. O

amazing O
concept O
at O
first O
but O
very O
efficient O
because O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
friendly!! O
the O
tartar B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
homemade O
fries B-TARGET
are O
a O
will O
for O
a O
price O
all O
made O
convenient! O

very O
well O

2 O
hours O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
for O
no O
service B-TARGET
and O
exhausted O
bosses! B-TARGET

So O
much O
to O
strongly O
recommend!! O

The O
former O
bosses O
had O
nothing O
to O
have, O
the O
bosses O
know O
nothing O
about O
restoration. O

Located O
in O
the O
small O
Venice O
with O
waterfront B-TARGET
terrace, I-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
seemed O
ideal O
for O
this O
day O
spent O
in O
Colmar. O

Then O
we O
were, O
say, O
surprised O
by O
the O
reception. B-TARGET

A O
rather O
contemptuous O
character O
welcomed O
us O
against O
the O
heart O
in O
view O
of O
his O
attitude. O

Even O
though O
the O
meal B-TARGET
was O
quite O
abundant O
and O
good, O
we O
did O
not O
have O
as O
much O
pleasure O
as O
the O
place B-TARGET
left O
us O
hoped. O

Was O
this O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season? O

Apart O
from O
this O
character, O
the O
other O
people O
in O
this O
restaurant O
were O
very O
courteous O
and O
affectionate. O

At O
first O
it O
wasn’t O
bad O
at O
all O
and O
then O
it O
slowly O
declined O
in O
quality O
without O
stopping! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
medium, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
too O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
in O
relation O
to O
quality O
and O
quantity O

We O
have O
been O
in O
the O
restaurant O
for O
3 O
years, O
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
only O
improving. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
worked O
and O
changes O
regularly, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
professional, O
attentive O
and O
charming. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
for O
three O
years. O

Continue O
to! O

We O
went O
there O
by O
chance O
and O
were O
not O
disappointed. O

The O
warmth O
of O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
contribute O
to O
a O
certain O
well-being!! O

Despite O
the O
present O
world, O
we O
were O
quickly O
served. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
wine B-TARGET
offered O
were O
delicious. O

We O
will O
return O
there! O

Welcome B-TARGET
to O
Minor! O

The B-TARGET
endless I-TARGET
wait! I-TARGET

The O
first O
dish O
served: O
insects O
present! O

We O
alert O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
reject O
the O
blame O
on O
us O
(insects O
coming O
from O
outside). O

We O
give O
a O
second O
chance. O

The O
second O
dish O
is O
served O
with O
insects. O

The O
staff O
replied: O
“If O
you O
didn’t O
want O
insects, O
you O
had O
to O
eat O
inside!” O

I O
strongly O
recommend! O

I O
rarely O
eat O
the O
meals O
of O
the O
day O
in O
the O
restaurants O
where O
I O
go O
but O
I O
made O
an O
exception O
this O
time. O

The O
people O
with O
whom O
I O
ate O
lunch O
ordered O
the O
pdj O
and O
so O
I O
did O
as O
they O
did O
not O
delay O
us. O

It O
has O
an O
excellent O
price/quality O
ratio O
and O
is O
also O
very O
good. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
made O
by O
the O
bosses O
is O
always O
smiling O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
service O
dynamic O
and O
professional. O

Knowing O
her O
husband’s O
cuisine B-TARGET
well, O
I’m O
not O
surprised O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day. O

The O
frame B-TARGET
has O
just O
been O
refreshed O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
and O
the O
house B-TARGET
that O
houses O
the O
restaurant O
has O
also O
been O
renovated, O
in O
short: O
What O
a O
positive. O

Small O
restaurant O
with O
well-maintained O
tables. O

There O
is O
a O
shortage O
of O
warmth O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
will O
follow. O

The O
different O
menus B-TARGET
based O
on O
"Mezzés" O
are O
similar, O
the O
specialities O
are O
successful O
for O
some O
(hummous, B-TARGET
tabulé..), B-TARGET
less O
successful O
for O
others O
such O
as O
for O
example O
the O
purée B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
aubergine I-TARGET
rather O
fade O
or O
those O
bullets B-TARGET
having O
a O
"burned" O
back O
taste. O

We O
are O
in O
the O
classic O
of O
the O
genre O
with O
little O
surprise O
and O
rather O
high O
prices. O

A O
special O
mention, O
however, O
is O
the O
list B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
(Lebanese) O
and O
the O
gesture O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
who O
offered O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
desserts. O

Let’s O
have O
a O
good O
evening O
anyway, O
but O
a O
desirable O
effort O
on O
the O
Mediterranean O
tastes O
and O
flavors! O

Not O
to O
miss! O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
every O
point O
of O
view O
the O
service B-TARGET
the O
patroness B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
the O
excellent O
dishes B-TARGET
the O
wine B-TARGET
very O
good! O

Tourists O
passing O
in O
the O
corner O
we O
will O
be O
back O
there O
without O
hesitation O
next O
time O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants B-TARGET
has O
long O
done O

Tapas O
bar O
at O
night, O
changing O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
sometimes O
approximate. O

The O
wines B-TARGET
are O
good O
but O
not O
excellent, O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
when O
there O
are O
still O
are O
good, O
fortunately O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
wanted O
to O
push O
the O
door O
to O
this O
place O
in O
the O
port O
area O
of O
Bayonne O
and O
here O
we O
did!!! O

The O
deco B-TARGET
could O
be O
revisited O
but O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
good O
the O
ordering O
is O
quick O
and O
very O
smiling. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
classic O
but O
correct O
with O
a O
price O
that O
is O
too.Then O
comes O
the O
musical B-TARGET
atmosphere I-TARGET
that O
corresponds O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
one O
makes O
of O
its O
places. O

Have O
a O
good O
evening O
in O
this O
place. B-TARGET

Beef B-TARGET
way O
chewing O
gum, O
soft O
dark O
brown O
color O
fries B-TARGET
and O
still O
bathing O
in O
their O
oil. O

The O
austerity O
service. B-TARGET

What O
else O
to O
say? O

We O
have O
rarely O
eaten O
so O
badly O
in O
Bordeaux. O

There O
is O
already O
a O
big O
hygiene O
level O
missed: O
the O
cook O
goes O
out O
with O
his O
gloves O
and O
then O
goes O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
without O
changing O
them. O

Then, O
uncooked O
meat B-TARGET
and O
soft O
fries.... B-TARGET
(sick O
the O
next O
day) O

In O
the O
evening O
there O
is O
no O
menu O
so O
it O
is O
super O
expensive O
(quality O
/price O
ratio O
we O
do O
not O
find O
it O
in O
my O
opinion). O

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
original O
and O
attractive O
and O
the O
products B-TARGET
of O
quality, O
unfortunately O
the O
rating O
is O
far O
too O
salty O
compared O
to O
the O
experience O
delivered. O

Indeed, O
the O
rather O
heavy O
welcome B-TARGET
leaves O
room O
for O
a O
service B-TARGET
lacking O
enthusiasm O
and O
a O
smile. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
good, O
well O
cooked O
and O
presented O
but O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
are O
rather O
high O
and O
in O
the O
end, O
the O
rating O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
in O
disagreement O
with O
the O
experience O
lived O
(more O
than O
100€ O
to O
two O
for O
1 O
entry/2 O
dishes/1 O
dessert O
with O
wine O
and O
coffee), O
in O
a O
rather O
successful O
vintage O
/ O
rustic O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
but O
wasted O
by O
pop/variet O
music B-TARGET
unrelated O
to O
the O
frame O
and O
the O
concept, O
broadcast O
a O
little O
too O
loud O
for O
a O
restaurant O
or O
one O
wants O
to O
spend O
a O
moment O
of O
calm O
and O
relaxation. O

My O
heartbeat O
of O
2014. O

Cheese O
enthusiast, O
when O
I O
went O
down O
to O
the O
cheese B-TARGET
cellar, I-TARGET
with O
unlimited O
access, O
with O
more O
than O
200 O
cheeses O
to O
taste, O
I O
thought O
myself O
in O
heaven O
for O
32€. O

Adding O
to O
this O
a O
nuts B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
binne O
and O
fig O
bread, O
lardons O
and O
I O
pass, O
plus O
a O
nice O
service, B-TARGET
I O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
every O
passage O
here O
(my O
1st O
visit O
called O

Possibility O

20/20 O

the O
rest B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
very O
nice O
evening O
step O
with O
a O
welcoming O
reception. B-TARGET

Simple O
but O
effective O
for O
an O
evening O
meal, O
to O
discover O
but O
at O
noon O
it O
should O
be O
fine. O

We O
were O
five O
for O
business O
meals O
all O
that O
went O
very O
well O
we O
all O
found O
our O
great O
dishes, B-TARGET
we O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
come O
back. O

As O
every O
year O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
for O
my O
birthday, O
I O
booked O
on O
the O
internet. O

We O
arrive, O
the O
manager O
does O
not O
find O
us O
on O
the O
reservations. O

He O
tells O
us O
that O
he O
no O
longer O
looks O
at O
the O
internet...Why O
offer O
the O
option O
in O
this O
case??? O

He O
houses O
where O
he O
can. O

A O
waitress B-TARGET
of O
a O
certain O
age O
very O
unpleasant O
and O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
see O
the O
guests O
leave, O
not O
even O
finished O
the O
entrance, O
they O
take O
us O
the O
dish, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
tell O
you O
the O
reflections O
of O
a O
questionable O
taste. O

This O
has O
changed O
a O
lot O
and O
we O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
put O
our O
feet O
back O
on O
it. O

I O
hadn’t O
been O
back O
for O
15 O
years. O

Very O
disappointed O

Dinner B-TARGET
not O

Digestion O
complicated O
the O
next O

all O
my O

myself... O

Very O
long O
service, B-TARGET
the O

who O
tells O
her O
life O
while O
the O
restaurant O
is O
crowded O
and O
everyone O
is O
waiting O
for, O
mistakes O
in O
dishes, O
noise O

the O

We O
have O
been O
delivered O
several O
times O
and O
we O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
on O
site O
is O
deplorable... O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good O
and O
the O
deco B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

Invited O
to O
a O
professional O
dinner O
(group O
of O
20 O
people) O
we O
presented O
this O
restaurant O
as O
a O
good O
address O
of O
the O
city. O

So O
it O
was O
with O
the O
water O
in O
the O
mouth O
that O
we O
were O
received O
in O
this O
establishment. O

Complete O
menu O
of O
very O
good O
quality/price O
ratio O
(proposed O
products, B-TARGET
cooking O
and O
presentation O
of O
dishes) B-TARGET
and O
quick O
service B-TARGET
but O
there O
are O
a O
few O
points O
to O
improve O
to O
be O
a O
good O
restaurant: B-TARGET
maintenance O
of O
sanitary O
equipment O
in O
the O
"water O
room", O
warmth O
of O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
selection O
of O
proposed O
wines B-TARGET
(I O
just O
saw O
on O
tripadvisor O
that O
it O
was O
a O
wine O
bar, O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
concept O
then) O

Recommended O
by O
a O
friend, O
you O
don’t O
regret O
the O
experience. O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
offered O
according O
to O
arrival, O
concise O
but O
extremely O
tasty O
menus. B-TARGET

Absolutely O
recommend O
it. O

Really O
an O
address B-TARGET
to O
remember O
for O
meat O
lovers, O
an O
entrecôte B-TARGET
that O
melts O
in O
the O
mouth, O
a O
simple O
but O
tasty O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
a O
glass O
of O
good O
quality O
wine. B-TARGET

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
address. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
everything O
:) O

Welcome O
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
pleasant O
and O
efficient. O

All O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good O
with O
a O
special O
mention O
for O
the O
Breton B-TARGET
cassoulet I-TARGET

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
full O
at O
noon, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
arrive O
early. O

Welcome B-TARGET
cold, O
barely O
installed O
and O
the O
card O
in O
hand O
that O
we O
come O
to O
order. O

Take O
three O
quarters O
of O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
the O
dish. O

It’s O
a O
piece O
that O
is O
broadly O
transmitted O
from O
hand O
to O
hand. O

I O
don’t O
call O
it O
a O
restaurant O
service. B-TARGET

A O
meat B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
cooked O
as O
requested: O
bleeding O
and O
not O
as O
requested. O

No O
dessert O
orders O
were O
received O
after O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting O
for O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dish. O

We O
decided O
to O
leave O
without O
dessert. O

It B-TARGET
was I-TARGET
as O
unpleasant O
as O
the O
reception. B-TARGET

I O
was O
disappointed O
with O
our O
evening O
because O
I O
met O
this O
tavern B-TARGET
in O
better O
days. O

Much O
too O
expensive O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

There O
is O
a O
quality/price B-TARGET
ratio O
that O
can O
be O
commented O
out. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
+++. O

We O
have O
rarely O
eaten O
such O
poor O
pizza...not B-TARGET
cooked, O
poorly O
garmented... O

Unfortunately, O
it O
is O
not O
recommended!!! O

Excellent O
restaurant, B-TARGET

grilled O
in O
the O
bottom O

in O
Barcelona O

Copyful O
and O
good O
tapas B-TARGET

Excellent O
meat B-TARGET
for O
amateurs O

Unusual O
but O
to O
be O
known. O

Listen O
very O
much!! O

For O
the O
first O
time O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
kitchen O
in O
the O
remains O
I O
frequent O
in O
Rennes, O
it O
is O
a O
pity. O

Friendly O
wine B-TARGET
card, I-TARGET
they O
refuse O
to O
correct O
the O
shot O
on O
a O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
served O
more O
generously O
before O
(at O
5.90€ O
the O
glass, O
the O
behavior O
of O
the O
boss B-TARGET
(?) O
is O
disappointing). O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
good, O
cooked O
as O
requested. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
soft, O
also O
a O
pity, O
for O
a O
rest O
that O
serves O
dishes B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
potatoes. O

In O
short, O
a O
formula B-TARGET
at O
the O
right O
prices O
for O
the O
city O
center, O
a O
real O
potential O
but O
lack O
of O
commercial O
sense O
and O
small O
hics O
that O
coincide... O
it O
is O
still O
a O
pity, O
especially O
to O
have O
done O
it O
to O
a O
merchant O
of O
the O
mouth O
trades O
of O
the O
corner... O

A O
good O
little O
rest B-TARGET
that O
serves O
excellent O
pizzas B-TARGET
or O
other O
small O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
prefer O
to O
start O
something O
else O

Late O
service B-TARGET
possible: O
practical O
after O
a O
good O
movie O

Welcome B-TARGET
to O

A O
boss O
that O
could O
be O
a O
school O
case O
in O
hotel O
schools. O

He O
doesn’t O
say O
hello, O
lowers O
his O
head, O
doesn’t O
look O
you O
in O
the O
eyes O
and O
gives O
that O
feeling O
that O
you’re O
bothering O
him. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
him O
for O
the O
service O
and O
apologize O
for O
disturbing O
him O
during O
his O
work. O

He O
told O
me O
it O
was O
boring O
to O
work O
on O
a O
Sunday. O

I O
live O
in O
Dijon O
and O
this O
is O
the O
last O
time O
I O
have O
been O
there. O

We O
always O
appreciate O
restoring O
ourselves O
"to O
the O
Italian" O
in O
this O
tiny O
rest B-TARGET
of O
Dionysus. O

But O
the O
last O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
less O
good: O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
paste I-TARGET
was O
hard O
to O
cut, O
would O
not O
the O
boss O
buy O
new O
knives, O
because O
those O
from O
IKEA O
leave O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
for O
this O
kind O
of O
dish. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
come O
and O
eat O
without O
booking. O

On O
the O
Bareuzay B-TARGET
Square, I-TARGET
symbolic O
of O
Dijon, O
a O
pleasant O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
trivial, O
with O
a O
classic O
"Plat O
Bourguignons" O
option. O

A O
very O
limited O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wines, I-TARGET
both O
in O
quantity O
and O
quality. O

We O
took O
a O
dijonese O
sauce O
andouillette O
with O
mustard O
and O
its O
accompanying O
fries O
and O
a O
andouillette O
with O
small O
vegetables O
and O
purée. O

The O
andouillette B-TARGET
that O
wasn’t O
a O
5A O
was O
excellent, O
the O
fries, B-TARGET
vegetables B-TARGET
and O
purée B-TARGET
as O
well. O

Overall O
very O
satisfactory. O

There O
is O
nothing O
to O
blame O
the O
service B-TARGET
if O
it O
is O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
close O
the O
store! O

On O
the O
shape: O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
rather O
well O
decorated, O
bright O
and O
pleasant, O
entirely O
in O
American O
style. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
is O
smiling O
and O
welcoming, O
even O
if O
sometimes O
he O
does O
a O
little O
too O
much, O
but O
it’s O
better O
like O
that. O

On O
the O
bottom: O
I O
went O
there O
2 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
3 O
months O
to O
eat O
a O
hamburger O
and O
frankly O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
plate B-TARGET
are O
not O
up O
to O
the O
price O
and O
this O
is O
really O
the O
point O
where O
the O
problem O
lies. O

The O
hamburgers B-TARGET
are O
sold O
between O
12 O
and O
16 O
euros O
which O
is O
a O
lot O
too O
much O
for O
very O
industrial O
preparations: B-TARGET
hardened O
bread B-TARGET
by O
cooking, O
no O
vegetables O
in O
the O
sandwich B-TARGET
and O
fries B-TARGET
that O
are O
not O
homemade. O

In O
summary, O
this O
establishment O
is O
a O
bit O
like O
Canada O
Dry, O
it O
looks O
like O
it, O
but O
it O
is O
not. O

An O
old O
experience O
at O
this O
establishment O
in O
2013 O
gave O
me O
the O
desire O
to O
go O
back O
there. O

If O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
the O
setting B-TARGET
are O
pleasant, O
don't O
be O
in O
a O
hurry, O
2:30 O
for O
the O
menus O
of O
the O
day, O
it O
starts O
to O
do O

Plus O
7 O
euros O
50 O
for O
two O
eggs B-TARGET
mimosa I-TARGET
without O
blossoms O
is O
just O
theft O

I O
give O
you O
hot O
and O
unflavored O
dishes. B-TARGET

Coffee O
can’t O
clean O
up O
everything. O

So O
disappointed O
with O
my O
second O
experience, O
my O
wallet O
will O
remember O
it. O

We O
had O
lunch O
at O
this O
family O
restaurant. O

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
generous. O

Having O
tasted O
the O
mountainous B-TARGET
crêpe, I-TARGET
this O
is O
copious O
and O
well-grained. O

Cider, B-TARGET
not O
only O
exceptional, O
is O
fresh O
and O
accompanies O
well. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
price, O
I O
do O
not O
find O
them O
excessive O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
served. O

Working O
with O
family, O
couple O
or O
friends. O

Very O
nice O
decoration. B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
has O
a O
flashy O
light, O
it O
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
very O
relaxing. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
nickel. O

Very O
disappointing: O
Dish, B-TARGET
somewhat O
old O
decor. B-TARGET

Spiders O
are O
not O
very O
sharp. O

On O
the O
meal O
side O
we O
had O
to O
claim O
twice O
to O
get O
the O
wine O
that O
we O
had O
taken O
in O
aperitif. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
not O
served O
at O
the O
right O
temperature. O

Beautiful O
drinks O
would O
have O
been O
appreciated O
to O
drink O
a O
good O
wine. B-TARGET

For O
the O
dish O
the O
waiter O
had O
told O
us O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
served O
with O
a O
foie O
gras O
sauce, O
we O
did O
not O
find O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
foie O
gras O
because O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
a O
wine B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
that O
completely O
masked O
the O
foie O
gras. O

For O
the O
delicious B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
dessert: I-TARGET
nothing O
more O
extraordinary O
than O
classics O
with O
plenty O
of O
cream O
with O
butter. O

You O
do O
not O
go O
out O
with O
hunger O
because O
it O
is O
abundant. O

In O
conclusion, O
too O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
ate: O
lack O
of O
originality O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
level. O

I O
can O
only O
say O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
simply O
amazing O
/ O
the O
unique O
menu B-TARGET
at O
36 O
euros O
lets O
you O
discover O
some O
typical O
Corsica O
dishes. O

Attention O
to O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

A O
good O
mother’s O
kitchen B-TARGET
that O
holds O
on O
to O
the O
body. O

And O
to O
crown O
the O
whole O
of O
friendly O
waiters B-TARGET
has O
the O
pronounced O
accent O
with O
always O
a O
sense O
of O
humor. O

If O
you O
come O
from O
the O
Basque O
country... O

I O
love O
the O
heat O
like O
that. O

Bravo O
to O

not O
terrible. O

Dry O
pizza, B-TARGET
very O
few O
ingredients O
and O
a O
very O
dry O
edge O
for O
the O
Regina O
Bianca. O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
price. O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
during O
our O
2h O
stop O
after O
our O
boat O
ride. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
was O
right O
for O
a O
quick O
stop, O
the O
very O
friendly O
boss B-TARGET
and O
the O
beautiful O
landscape. B-TARGET

Really O
horrible O
some O
things B-TARGET
are O
heated, O
some O
not O
cooked, O
you O
can't O
call O
that O
the O
kitchen! O

Really O
zero! O

Excellent O
people, B-TARGET
we’re O
addicted O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
get O
dried O
up. O

The O
“complete” B-TARGET
is O
famous, O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
“samurai” B-TARGET
of O
its O
competitor O
the O
bigban. B-TARGET

I O
miss O
that! O

Only O
in O
Besançon. O

The O
cook B-TARGET
is O
adorable. O

Only O
to O
take. O

We O
are O
warned, O

It O
is O
fresh. O

Yes, O
it’s O
pretty O
hot. O

But O
after O
that: O

The O
complexity O
announced O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
is O
it O
or O
not? O

It O
is O
not O
to O
fall O
to O
the O
ground O

There O
may O
be O
sauces B-TARGET
"on O
etagere" O
in O
the O
kitchen O
dishes O

In O
short, O
nothing O
that O
justifies O
3 O
hours O
at O
the O
table O
for O
2 O
dishes O
for O
4 O
people, O
unless O
this O
is O
a O
good O
way O
to O
stand O
out O
from O
other O
Vietnamese/Thai O
restaurants. O

of O
the O
good! O

Welcome B-TARGET
to O
Zero O

REFUSED O
PASSTIME O
while O
they O
are O
inside O
and O
notified O
at O
booking O
and O
on O
arrival. O

This O
is O
a O
beautiful O
scam!! O

We O
were O
insulted O
by O
the O
responsible B-TARGET
on O
December O
20, O
2014 O
it O
is O
UNADMISSIBLE!!! O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
for O
the O
bosses O
who O
lose O
the O
world O
because O
of O
the O
employee B-TARGET
who O
thinks O
of O
himself O
as O
a O
boss. O

A O
very O
nice O
servant. B-TARGET

Goodbye O
to O
you!! O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
really O
friendly O
and O
the O
deco B-TARGET
very O
nice O
which O
contrasts O
with O
the O
little O
kindness O
of O
one O
of O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
rather O
unpleasant O
and O
past O
master O
in O
the O
art O
of O
making O
reflections O
to O
the O
clientele. O

The O
other O
servant, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
is O
very O
left O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

And O
to O
perfect O
the O
whole O
very O
loud O
music B-TARGET
of O
the O
lounge O
space O
prevents O
any O
conversation O
between O
guests O
which O
is O
a O
pity O
because O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good O
as O
a O
whole O
except O
for O
desserts B-TARGET
that O
have O
been O
sold O
to O
us O
as O
home O
desserts O
but O
that O
seem O
rather O
out O
of O
Metro O
or O
other O
catering O
providers! O

The O
book O
contains O
a O
few O
spelling O
errors. O

Not O
much O
is O
enough O
to O
improve O
the O
whole. O

A O
simple O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
fresh O
and O
homemade O
products. B-TARGET

A B-TARGET
warm I-TARGET
welcome. I-TARGET

Even O
the O
little O
cookies B-TARGET
that O
accompany O
the O
coffee O
are O
made O
at O
home. O

Nothing O
to O
say, O
simple O
but O
very O
good O
and O
very O
fresh. O

Welcome B-TARGET
to O
the O
top! O

Restaurant B-TARGET
without O
pretensions O
from O
the O
front O
door O
but O
with O
a O
quality O
kitchen! B-TARGET

Kir O
offered O
with O
an O
appetite O
boost O
with O
rillettes O
and O
sausage. O

There O
is O
little O
choice O
on O
the O
card, B-TARGET
but O
this O
is O
also O
how O
you O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
make O
good O
dishes! B-TARGET

And O
it O
succeeded! O

This O
is O
my O
canteen O
I O
love. O

Keep O
going, O
I O
warmly O
encourage O
you! O

A O
friendly O
local, B-TARGET
very O
young, O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
at O
the O
bar O
as O
well O
as O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
quality-price O
ratio O
remains O
tense, O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
meals, B-TARGET
even O
though O
the O
space B-TARGET
is O
interesting, O
between O
the O
trees. O

It O
would O
be O
interesting O
to O
discover O
young O
artists O
who O
appear O
there O
regularly. O

Unfortunately, O
they O
are O
hardly O
respected: O
poor O
acoustics, O
noisy O
audiences. O

Managers O
should O
be O
encouraged O
to O
allow O
a O
sound O
to O
be O
heard. O

The O
idea O
looked O
nice, O
but O
who O
are O
you O
laughing O
at? O

The O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
microscopic O
and O
the O
prices O
stratospheric! O

Count O
around O
€20 O
for O
a O
coconut B-TARGET
egg O
(even O
not O
cooked O
properly), O
a O
dish B-TARGET
containing O
about O
50g O
of O
chicken O
and O
3 O
green O
beans O
and O
two O
potato O
rolls O
and O
a O
fruit O
salad... O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
extremely O
noisy. O

Go O
away, O
unless O
you’re O
really O
hungry. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
the O
addition O
is O
salty. O

The O
dishes O
are O
fine, O
the O
sauces B-TARGET
are O
good O
too. O

Parpadelle B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
and O
strawberries B-TARGET
very O
good O
but O
slightly O
too O
fat O

The O
calf B-TARGET
was O
tasty. O

The O
Divine O
Cake B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
welcome B-TARGET
at O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
small O
but O
very O
pleasant. O

In O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
c O
is O
correct, O
but O
n O
is O
not O
exceptional! O

(I’m O
a O
fan O
of O
Italian O
cuisine O
and O
I O
go O
to O
Italy O
regularly O
so O
I’m O
pretty O
difficult!) O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
foundation I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Correctly O
served O
dishes, O
excellent O
turbot B-TARGET
pavement I-TARGET
and O
right O
prices O
for O
the O
neighborhood. O

And O
to O
cover O
it O
all, O
a O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
smile O
from O
beginning O
to O
end O
:)! O

I O
always O
come O
back O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
with O
great O
pleasure. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
avoid. O

Bad O
quality O
price O
ratio. O

The O
entrecôte, B-TARGET
which O
in O
the O
menu O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
300 O
g, O
was O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
school’s O
canteen. O

And O
generally O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
ridiculous O
for O
their O
price. O

The O
apples B-TARGET
were O
just O
fries. O

It’s O
a O
pity, O
because O
the O
scene B-TARGET
is O
impressive. O

An O
excellent O
restau, B-TARGET
the O
honey B-TARGET
magret I-TARGET
is O
divine, O
the O
perfect O
blow, B-TARGET
the O
very O
pleasant O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
quick O
service, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
great O
deco, B-TARGET
a O
good O
time O
with O
the O
family! O

Not O
at O
all O
stock O
markets, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
expensive. O

If O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
right O
(Saint-Jacques B-TARGET
- I-TARGET
risotto)... I-TARGET
you O
shouldn't O
be O
too O
hungry... O
only O
three O
Saint-Jacques O
barely O
hot. O

For O
the O
other O
dishes, B-TARGET
no O
green O
vegetables O
are O
offered O
as O
an O
accompaniment O
you O
have O
to O
be O
content O
with O
fries, O
potato O
risotto O
or O
vegetables O
from O
the O
pot O
to O
the O
fire....The O
service B-TARGET
not O
existing, O
to O
the O
question O
of O
what O
is O
in O
the O
gourmand O
coffee O
the O
answer O
was O
it O
depends... O

A O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
boils O
her O
hair O
behind O
the O
bar...And O
the O
little O
touch O
that O
goes O
well O
we O
came O
out O
impregnated O
with O
a O
smell O
of O
fried O
food... O

There’s O
no O
need O
to O
go O
back O
and O
forth O
in O
this O
bistro. B-TARGET

It O
was O
still O
very O
busy O
at O
noon, O
so O
I O
only O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
go O
there O
at O
night. O

And O
every O
time, O
no O
disappointment: O
varied O
card, B-TARGET
fresh O
and O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
tasty O
dishes, B-TARGET
abundant O
portions B-TARGET
and O
very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Prices O
are O
also O
correct. O

So O
to O
advise! O

It’s O
been O
three O
times O
now O
that O
I’ve O
been O
to O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
three O
times O
that O
I’ve O
always O
the O
same. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
and O
in O
good O
quantities. O

There O
are O
foods O
for O
all O
types O
of O
foods O
(meat, O
fish). O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
shaping B-TARGET
cassette O
or O
the O
boudin B-TARGET
(if O
it O
comes O
back O
to O
the O
card), O
but O
overall, O
everything O
is O
good. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
plate, I-TARGET
if O
you O
have O
a O
little O
space, O
is O
generous O
and O
excellent. O

So O
you O
will O
understand O
a O
little O
heartbeat: O
go O
there O
with O
friends O
or O
among O
lovers O
you O
will O
never O
be O
disappointed! O

We O
came O
to O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant O
in O
late O
November O
2014. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time. O

Little O
hic: O
the O
sausage B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
offered O
to O
the O
aperitif O
for O
two O
people O
was O
really O
not O
overwhelming, O
even O
for O
two O
people. O

But O
for O
the O
rest, O
varied O
cuisine, B-TARGET
good O
wine B-TARGET
card, I-TARGET
we O
will O
come O
back! O

Long O
and O
cold O
service. B-TARGET

Freezed O
and O
poorly O
defrosted O
foods. B-TARGET

For O
the O
same O
price, O
you O
can O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
addresses O
in O
this O
same O
street! O

Dinner O
with O
friends O
and O
a O
terrible O
experience. O

A O
service B-TARGET
of O
incredible O
slowness. O

A O
single O
menu B-TARGET
imposed O
for O
the O
table O
of O
ten O
(!!!). O

A O
terrible O
choice. B-TARGET

Preparation O
of O
poor O
dishes. B-TARGET

Terrible O
taste O
- O
especially O
never O
take O
the O
beef B-TARGET
of O
a O
last O
disgusting O
taste O
in O
a O
pot O
of O
potato O
puré O
like O
a O
bitter O
soup. O

Extremely O
expensive: O
185 O
euros O
per O
couple. O

and O
to O
avoid!! O

It O
is O
unthinkable O
that O
restaurants B-TARGET
like O
this O
exist O
in O
Paris. O

C O
is O
an O
original O
place B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
your O
birthday. O

We O
were O
a O
table O
of O
15 O
on O
a O
Friday O
evening, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
scary, O
cold O
dishes, B-TARGET
not O
kind, O
restaurant B-TARGET
so O
dark O
that O
you O
can’t O
see O
what O
we O
eat O
there O
(I O
understand O
why O
now...) O

The O
server B-TARGET
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
accuse O
his O
clients O
of O
not O
paying O
(while O
c O
is O
his O
job O
to O
calculate O
correctly..) O
the O
manager O
is O
aggressive O
and O
slams O
his O
clients O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
they O
do O
not O
pay.... O

There O
are O
15 O
people O
who O
will O
never O
return. O

Microwave O
heated O
kitchen, B-TARGET
slow O
service, B-TARGET
but O
above O
all O
excessive O
price O
given O
fairly O
average O
quality. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
avoid. O

Positive: O
Smiling O
welcome, B-TARGET
friendly O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
charming O
setting B-TARGET

Negative: O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
plate B-TARGET

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
short, O
which O
can O
be O
an O
advantage O
(important O
turn-over O
thus O
freshness O
of O
products) O
but O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
a O
disadvantage O
when O
there O
are O
missing O
products B-TARGET
(the O
truffle O
that O
day), O
so O
limited O
choice. O

We O
had O
the O
mistake O
of O
falling O
onto O
a O
burger B-TARGET
and O
a O
fish B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chips, I-TARGET
fatal O
mistake: O
average O
hamburgers, O
soft O
and O
fatty O
fries, B-TARGET
as O
far O
as O
fish O
and O
chips O
appear O
to O
be O
ingurgitating O
only O
fat-bathed O
fried O
pasta. O

The O
tropical B-TARGET
cake, I-TARGET
though O
delicious, O
was O
not O
enough O
to O
catch O
up O
with O
this O
missed O
lunch. O

You O
should O
be O
careful O
if O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
almost O
empty O
on O
a O
Friday O
night. O

Under O
the O
pretext O
of O
inventory, O
half O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
entrances B-TARGET
and O
wines B-TARGET
were O
missing. O

It O
was O
cold O
throughout O
the O
meal. O

The O
toilets O
are O
dirty O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
uninvolved O
as O
far O
as O
possible. O

What O
a O
disappointment! O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
good, O
but O
weak. O

Disappointment O
and O
poor O
reception. B-TARGET

Asked O
for O
a O
change O
of O
place O
because O
we O
were O
near O
the O
door O
but O
we O
remained O
unanswered. O

We O
felt O
bothered O
as O
he O
said O
to O
his O
colleague, O
"Pff O
they O
want O
to O
change O
place." O

Very O
dry O
chicken O
and O
cold O
fried B-TARGET
for O
15,50 O
€ O
+ O
very O
dry O
grilled B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
dried B-TARGET
rice O
for O
16,50 O
€ O

Also, O
the O
quantities O
are O
not O
the O
same O
between O
a O
menu O
and O
a O
plate O
à O
la O
carte. O

This O
was O
the O
first O
and O
last O
time. O

It O
is O
a O
shame O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
escape. O

$42 O
for O
two O
glasses B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
- O
hardly O
passable O
- O
without O
giving O
us O
the O
card, O
of O
course. O

Antipathetic O
servers B-TARGET
as O
possible. O

Stools O
and O
a O
depressing O
interior. B-TARGET

No O
need O
to O
say O
more, O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
terrible. O

Old O
decoration, B-TARGET
dirty O
and O
fatty O
menus, B-TARGET
an O
inexisting O
service, B-TARGET
a O
hot O
beer B-TARGET
that O
has O
not O
even O
been O
changee, O
too O
cooked O
meats B-TARGET
(accompanied O
by O
pears!!) O
and O
limited O
damaged... O

This O
is O
a O
scandal O
to O
avoid!!! O

Very O
good O
bistro. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
welcome!!! B-TARGET
We O
ate O
very O
well O
with O
traditional O
dishes B-TARGET
as O
at O
home, O
the O
quality O
but O
also O
the O
quantity O
are O
in O
rdv!!! O

Bistrot B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
especially O
if O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
while O
in O
Montmartre O
without O
being O
in O
the O
hustle O
of O
tourist O
restaurants!!! O

But O
think O
about O
booking O
as O
there O
are O
not O
many O
seats O
and O
the O
bistro B-TARGET
is O
filling O
up O
quickly!!! O

I O
rarely O
saw O
this. O

The O
calf B-TARGET
was O
so O
old O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
said O
that O
it O
was O
a O
bloody O
bull. O

The O
jambon B-TARGET
was O
roasted O

The O
Collant O
Paths B-TARGET

Smooth O
and O
unsweetened O
cream B-TARGET

And O
they O
dare O
call O
it O
Escalope O
Saltimbocca... O

At O
18 O
euros O
90 O
is O
a O
flight O

The O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
rosé I-TARGET
must O
have O
come O
from O
a O
cubic O
bottom. O

As O
for O
work, B-TARGET
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
talk O
about O
it. O

Not O
a O
smile, O
not O
a O
word. O

They O
have O
to O
eat O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Avoid O
at O
all O
costs O

In O
the O
neighborhood O
for O
the O
price O
of O
a O
dish O
you O
will O
have O
a O
full O
meal O
decorated O
with O
a O
smile O

Very O
pleasant O
despite O
a O
very O
good O
location. B-TARGET

Servant B-TARGET
not O
at O
all O
nice O
with O
a O
very O
dark O
humor O
and O
no O
thanks O
or O
nothing O
leaving. O

The O
service O
is O
too O
fast O
for O
it O
to O
be O
done O
live. O

The O
salmon B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
fresh O
and O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
not O
cooked O
enough. O

House B-TARGET
desserts I-TARGET
seem O
to O
be O
right. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
in O
this O
small O
restaurant O
with O
sober O
and O
elegant O
deco. B-TARGET

The O
menus B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
20 I-TARGET
euros I-TARGET
are O
served O
at O
noon O
and O
evening O
and O
include O
entrance O
+ O
dish O
+ O
dessert. O

We O
went O
there O
at O
noon O
with O
friends O
and O
it O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
efficient O
and O
the O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

You O
can O
also O
take O
the O
more O
sophisticated O
34 O
euro O
menu B-TARGET
or O
choose O
the O
card. O

A O
real O
luxury: O
a O
quiet O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Paris! O

Sure O
the O
card B-TARGET
is O
not O
great, O
the O
price O
is O
not O
cheap, O
but O
when O
it O
is O
nice O
and O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
lunch O
outside O
and O
hear O
each O
other O
talk O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
valuable. O

The B-TARGET
average I-TARGET
reception I-TARGET
seems O
to O
bother O
the O
staff. O

We O
sit O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
are O
asked O
to O
move. O

We O
choose O
our O
menu, O
carpaccio B-TARGET
comes O
from O
the O
subway O
it O
is O
certain O
and O
the O
fries B-TARGET
are O
not O
fresh. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
chocolate B-TARGET
foam I-TARGET
that O
has O
nothing O
of O
a O
foam. O

Instead O
of O
something O
too O
sweet. O

I O
asked O
for O
water O
twice O
before O
I O
got O
it. O

A O
little O
bit O
more: O
A O
waitress B-TARGET
offered O
us O
an O
aperitif. O

But O
to O
a O
slightly O
displaced O
attitude, O
embarrassing O
limit O
of O
a O
rough O
dragon. O

Some O
may O
like O
this, O
but O
our O
table O
was O
disturbed O
by O
it. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend, O
there O
are O
better O
and O
cheaper O
small O
breweries O
in O
Paris. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
in O
a O
pedestrian B-TARGET
street I-TARGET
dedicated O
to O
mass O
tourists O
and O
is O
surrounded O
by O
other O
restaurants O
of O
the O
same O
finish. O

The O
animation B-TARGET
here O
is O
painful O
and O
noisy O
and O
does O
not O
match O
the O
type O
of O
establishment O
we O
were O
looking O
for. O

The O
food B-TARGET
there O
is O
more O
than O
mediocre O
(burned O
fish, B-TARGET
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
flavorless O
molds, O
insipid O
desserts) B-TARGET
and O
a O
service B-TARGET
that O
does O
not O
exist O
plus O
an O
addition O
more O
than O
salty. O

The O
service B-TARGET
in O
this O
more O
than O
typical O
Paris O
bistro B-TARGET
is O
pleasantly O
good. O

And O
that O
is O
all. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
disappointing, O
too O
fatty O
with O
an O
unpleasant O
taste. O

The O
prices O
as O
one O
can O
imagine O
in O
this O
type O
of O
establishment O
are O
not O
too O
high O
but O
still O
too O
high O
for O
the O
quality O
served. O

Everything O
was O
bad. O

Starting O
with O
the O
thin O
and O
tiny O
shrimp, B-TARGET
the O
middle O
side B-TARGET
is O
full O
of O
tasteless O
veins O
and O
no O
texture. O

The O
totally O
absent O
and O
incompetent O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
the O
blind O
manager O
have O
it O
all. O

What O
a O
joke O
and O
to O
end O
up O
adding O
a O
$75 O
while O
I O
couldn’t O
eat O
anything! O

Avoid O
as O
the O
plague O

This O
is O
a O
typical O
French O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
delicious. O

Entrance B-TARGET
to O
the O
hot O
goat, O
followed O
by O
a O
duck B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
honey I-TARGET
/ O
lemon O
accompanied O
by O
jumped O
apples, O
a O
real O
delight! O

The O
basement B-TARGET
is O
also O
excellent. O

I O
have O
an O
address B-TARGET
to O
remember O
and O
where O
I O
would O
go O
back. O

The O
choice O
of O
buffet B-TARGET
is O
very O
limited. O

The O
warm O
food. B-TARGET

Welcome B-TARGET
to O
Medium. O

Overall O
the O
average... O

There O
is O
almost O
no O
choice O
of O
dessert. B-TARGET

To O
be O
willing O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
say. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
nice O
but O
the O
staff O
was O
not O
at O
your O
disposal. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
average. O

The O
choice O
is O
limited O
(ideal O
for O
small O
appetites) O

No O
vinnoiserie O
for O
a O
brunch B-TARGET
not O
top O
even O
if O
the O
concept O
is O
American O
we O
are O
in O
France O
and O
the O
minimum O
would O
have O
been O
a O
growing O

The O
staff B-TARGET
does O
not O
monitor O
your O
plates O
and O
are O
obliged O
to O
insist O
on O
being O
used. O

The O
only O
good O
thing O
is O
hot B-TARGET
chocolate. I-TARGET

Beautiful O
deco, B-TARGET
good O
music, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
quality/price O
ratio...a O
facility B-TARGET
that O
would O
be O
the O
most O
pleasant O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
not O
detestable O
and O
everything O
but O
professional: O

- O
An O
unfriendly O
rank B-TARGET
leader I-TARGET
who O
makes O
you O
feel O
bothered O
after O
barely O
putting O
a O
foot O
in O
the O
establishment O

Pressure O
servers/servers B-TARGET
(including O
at O
any O
start O
of O
service O
when O
the O
place O
is O
almost O
empty) O
and O
rarely O
impolite O

- O
Special O
mention O
to O
the O
bartender B-TARGET
who O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
only O
friendly O
person O
in O
the O
place O

In O
short, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
highlight O
for O
an O
establishment B-TARGET
highlighting O
its O
New O
York O
influences! O

After O
a O
fourth O
visit O
and O
a O
similar O
finding, O
I O
would O
not O
put O
my O
feet O
back! O

Let’s O
be O
clear, O
this O
is O
our O
favorite O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Paris! O

We O
have O
been O
there O
5 O
or O
6 O
times O
already O
and O
each O
time O
we O
have O
arranged O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
given O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
are O
in O
Paris. O

Last O
Thursday O
we O
the O
confit B-TARGET
pig I-TARGET
squirrel I-TARGET
with O
its O
gnocchis B-TARGET
(the O
best O
I O
have O
been O
brought O
to O
taste) O
and O
its O
girolles. O

As O
a O
dessert, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
inevitable O
lemon B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
served I-TARGET
otherwise, I-TARGET
we O
also O
delighted O
with O
the O
lost B-TARGET
brioche...Superb! I-TARGET

Entrance, O
dish, O
dessert O
for O
30 O
€ O
per O
night, O
glass O
of O
wine O
for O
8 O
€. O

In O
short, O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
have O
an O
opportunity O
to O
celebrate, O
we O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Last O
point, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
sober O
and O
good O
taste! O

Everything O
was O
very O
good: O
welcome B-TARGET
- O
deco B-TARGET
- O
dinner! B-TARGET

All O
the O
ingredients O
are O
put O
together O
to O
have O
a O
great O
evening! O

Very O
affordable O
price O
- O
I O
already O
very O
much O
want O
to O
come O
back O
there O
to O
reveal O
our O
heartbeat O
to O
our O
friends!! O

A O
great O
disappointment! O

The O
card B-TARGET
announces O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
dishes O
and O
we O
unfortunately O
had O
some O
dishes, B-TARGET
seeing O
very O
suitable O
at O
rates O
exceeding O
the O
service. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it... O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
poor, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
poor O
and O
the O
rating O
is O
very O
high. O

to O
avoid. O

I O
cannot O
give O
notes. O

A O
nice O
neighborhood O
bistro, B-TARGET
we O
eat O
well O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

Classic O
bistro O
dishes, B-TARGET
for O
“Paris” O
prices O
(15-20 O
euros). O

Go O
there O
if O
you O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
or O
at O
noon O
where O
the O
formulas B-TARGET
are O
more O
affordable. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
during O
the O
summer O
is O
very O
nice O
and O
quite O
spacious, O
ideal O
for O
a O
drink. O

The O
only O
strong O
point O
is O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

very O
pleasantly. O

A O
service B-TARGET
almost O
non-existent. O

Where O
are O
they O
going O
to O
find O
their O
waiters B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
waiters? I-TARGET

There O
is O
no O
professionalism. O

In O
the O

The O
freezing O
reigns. O

The O
suspicious O
freshness. O
industrial O
desserts. B-TARGET

Just O
to O
have O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
terrace O
and O
dinner O
elsewhere. O

Small O
brewery, O
nice O
and O
crowded O
card, B-TARGET
the O
servers B-TARGET
are O
not O
very O
friendly, O
performance O
above O
all. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O

correctly, O
the O

smells O
of O

3 O

A O

The O

back O
there. O

What O
a O
surprise O
in O
view O
of O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
brewery-restaurant O
where O
surely O
the O
waiters O
have O
kept O
the O
style O
of O
the O
large O
breweries O
but O
the O
service O
is O
a O
bit O
direct O
and O
the O
kitchen O
is O
really O
not O
up O
to O
the O
addition O
because O
without O
moving O
far O
we O
find O
other O
tables O
that O
they O
sometimes O
apart O
from O
the O
large O
towers O
remain O
reasonable O
but O
respect O
the O
clientele O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
reception. B-TARGET

In O
short, O
if O
you O
can O
avoid O
this O
trap O
to O
tourists O
do O
not O
hesitate. O

In O
this O
very O
tourist O
neighborhood, B-TARGET
this O
unpretentious O
little O
restaurant B-TARGET
offers O
inexpensive O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
even O
a O
very O
accessible O
menu B-TARGET
formula. I-TARGET

Of O
course, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
great O
kitchen, B-TARGET
but O
the O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
quite O
fair. O

A O
great O
location B-TARGET
with O
a O
great O
potential O
but O
everything O
was O
zero. O

A O
huge O
wait B-TARGET
to O
take O
the O
order O
and O
when O
the O
server B-TARGET
finally O
arrives, O
he O
takes O
the O
order O
of O
the O
last O
arriving. O

Long O
wait B-TARGET
to O
get O
his O
drinks. O

Many O
people O
lost O
their O
patience O
and O
left. O

Not O
friendly O
at O
all, O
no O
class O
at O
all. O

The O
worst O
was O
when O
I O
paid. O

Given O
the O
slowness O
for O
a O
server B-TARGET
to O
come O
to O
us, O
we O
headed O
to O
the O
boxes O
to O
pay. O

One O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
was O
quick O
this O
time O
coming O
to O
us O
because O
he O
seemed O
to O
think O
we O
were O
going O
to O
leave O
without O
paying. O

He O
gave O
us O
an O
unprecedented O
look. O

Really O
the O
service B-TARGET
will O
have O
been O
awful O
from O
beginning O
to O
end O
and O
those O
for O
most O
of O
the O
customers O
who O
were O
installed O
around O
us. O

Escape O
to O

They O
gave O
us O
the O
wrong O
dish, O
then O
when O
they O
changed O
it, O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
cold. O

We O
ordered O
a O
soft B-TARGET
chocolate, I-TARGET
a O
dish O
generally O
hard O
to O
miss, O
but O
it O
wasn’t O
soft O
and O
had O
no O
taste. O

Good O
quality O
service, B-TARGET
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
cuisine! B-TARGET

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
fresh O
and O
seasonal, O
this O
is O
a O
gift! O

Jy O
will O
come O
back O
to O
discover O
the O
other O
dishes O
on O
the O
map. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
suddenly O
we O
will O
be O
back O
there O
without O
worry! O

Very O
good O
card B-TARGET
with O
simple O
but O
sought-after O
dishes. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
really O
very O
friendly O
and O
welcoming. O

A O
delight O
in O
this O
neighborhood O
or O
many O
restaurants O
are O
traps O
for O
tourists. O

I O
highly O
recommend! O

I O
often O
come O
there O
at O
noon, O
great O
crêpes B-TARGET
and O
very O
large O
choices. O

The O
cookies B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
and O
at O
very O
reasonable O
prices. O

and O
sympathetic O
service. B-TARGET

Nothing O
transcendent; O
quality O
price O
ratio O
barely O
average, O
they O
are O
all O
like O
that O
on O
the O
street. O

Toilets O
and O
toilets O
to O
avoid. O

Do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
do O
a O
few O
hundred O
meters O
extra. O

Very O
good O
welcome, B-TARGET
complete O
brewery O
card, B-TARGET
good O
price O
quality O
ratio, O
pleasant O
setting. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
and O
efficient O
service, B-TARGET
we O
were O
served O
in O
less O
than O
10min O
on O
a O
Friday O
evening O
at O
8am. O

Quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
very O
correct, O
my O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
butcher O
was O
very O
good O
and O
tender, O
and O
my O
panna B-TARGET
cotta I-TARGET
delicious. O

Obviously, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
gastronomic O
rest B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
not O
what O
is O
asked O
for! O

Simple O
but O
good O
products B-TARGET
(plated O
eggs, O
roasted O
tomatoes O
and O
bacon), O
then O
successful O
home O
cheesecake. B-TARGET

The O
wait B-TARGET
and O
the O
servants B-TARGET
were O
friendly O
but O
somewhat O
outdated. O

Quality O
and O
home-made O
meals, B-TARGET
very O
good O
price-quality O
ratio, O
right O
next O
to O
the O
Eiffel O
Tower. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
welcome. B-TARGET

I O
tend O
to O
have O
preferences O
about O
the O
meals B-TARGET
in O
the O
breweries O
but O
we O
were O
satisfied. O

Frozen O
food, B-TARGET
of O
poor O
quality. O

Poor O
cooking O
of O
food. B-TARGET

There O
is O
no O
person O
in O
the O
restaurant O
to O
answer O
our O
requests. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

I O
loved O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Small O
and O
warm, O
we O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
at O
the O
top, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
was O
great, O
our O
dish B-TARGET
excellent! O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone! O

We O
stopped O
by O
chance O
in O
front O
of O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
does O
not O
pay O
a O
mine O
from O
the O
outside. O

What O
a O
good O
surprise! O

Products, B-TARGET
fresh, O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
very O
good. O

The O
whole O
showed O
originality O
without O
being O
pretentious, O
for O
a O
very O
correct O
amount. O

The O
prices O
are O
above O
the O
Paris O
average O
in O
view O
of O
the O
equally O
banal O
service. O

The O
meaningful O
benevolence O
as O
others O
confirmed O
it O
in O
the O
comments: O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service.... B-TARGET
for O
a O
smile. O

and O
nothing. O

Served O
with O
a O
stone O
lance. O

No O
thanks, O
what O
a O
sadness. O

So O
in O
case O
of O
absolute O
need O
only O
for O
survival O
otherwise O
look O
in O
the O
immediate O
vicinity. O

Meeting O
more O
friendly O
people. O

A O
disaster O
to O
be O
avoided. O

We O
went O
there O
before O
a O
show, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
overcrowded O
and O
unpleasant, O
a O
real O
Paris O
cliché! O

A O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
had O
served O
the O
order O
twice O
at O
a O
nearby O
table O
just O
screamed O
at O
his O
clients. O

As O
for O
us, O
our O
passage O
through O
the O
toilet O
was O
memorable, O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting O
(giant O
room, O
4 O
toilets O
for O
everyone, O
well O
played), O
a O
nauseable O
smell O
and O
frankly O
a O
cleanliness O
more O
than O
limit. O

Then, O
going O
back O
into O
the O
room, O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
annoyed O
to O
hear O
us O
say O
"there O
are O
no O
towels O
to O
wash O
hands O
down" O
makes O
a O
hook O
to O
my O
husband, O
who O
fails O
to O
spread O
all O
along O
the O
floor. O

An O
unnecessary O
attack O
that O
ruined O
the O
evening. O

In O
short, O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
there. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
framework. B-TARGET

But O
most O
of O
all O
fresh O
products, B-TARGET
finally O
real O
fries B-TARGET
that O
do O
not O
bathe O
in O
oil, O
fresh O
salad B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
little O
dessert!! B-TARGET

to O
recommend. O

I O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
at O
16 O
euros. O

Very O
good O
quality O
price O
ratio! O

The O
only O
good O
thing O
is O
the O
very O
nice O
framework. B-TARGET

Even O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
winter O
we O
were O
able O
to O
eat O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
thanks O
to O
the O
outdoor O
heating. O

Everything O
that O
is O
not O
prepared O
is O
good, O
the O
rest O
is O
unfavourable. O

Cocktail B-TARGET
too O
sweet O
vs O
good O
wine. B-TARGET

Cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
very O
good O
vs. O
Bruchetas B-TARGET
and O
pasta B-TARGET
without O
taste. O

But O
especially O
the O
worst O
our O
dishes O
arrived O
before O
the O
entrance, O
so O
we O
that O
we O
had O
not O
had O
the O
entrance. O

So O
our O
entrances O
arrived O
and O
then O
our O
dishes O
after O
a O
very O
long O
wait B-TARGET
while O
it O
was O
the O
plates O
arrived O
too O
early O
that O
they O
heated O
up... O
Cold O
pasta B-TARGET
above O
and O
smoking O
below O
= O
microwave. O

A O
bag B-TARGET
of O
water O
is O
a O
microwave. O

They O
didn’t O
have O
to O
make O
our O
dishes. O

In O
short, O
prepared B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
not O
good O
and O
they O
laugh O
at O
customers. O

A B-TARGET
very O
good O
kitchen, O
but O
in O
a O
“good” O
setting. B-TARGET

The O
wines B-TARGET
are O
very O
expensive. O

The O
disrespectful O
and O
disrespectful O
hotel B-TARGET
owner. I-TARGET

Absolutely O
to O
escape. O

We O
went O
there O
last O
night O
and O
we O
were O
more O
than O
disappointed. O

Unfortunate O
service, B-TARGET
poor O
meat B-TARGET
and O
very O
salty O
note! O

Avoid O
it O
urgently! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
delight O
in O
the O
dessert, O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
push O
the O
door O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
table O
on O
the O
floor. O

For O
dessert-knowers, O
it O
is O
especially O
necessary O
to O
take O
the O
thousand B-TARGET
fleas I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
fruit. I-TARGET

You O
can’t O
lick O
the O
plate O
because O
that’s O
not O
done, O
but O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
regret O
that O
your O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
finished. O

Don’t O
trust O
the O
empty O
entrance, O
everything O
happens O
on O
the O
floor. O

Beautiful O
deco, B-TARGET
low O
lighting, B-TARGET
relaxed O
welcome. B-TARGET

We O
tested O
the O
menu O
for O
70€. O

It O
includes O
8 O
surprising O
dishes O
and O
a O
fun O
mouthpiece. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast. O

The O
small O
amounts O
of O
the O
entries B-TARGET
are O
frustrating, O
as O
the O
flavors O
are O
excellent O
but O
they O
are O
well O
dosed O
to O
get O
to O
the O
dessert. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
seasonal. O

The O
chef O
mastered O
the O
mixture O
of O
tastes O
and O
textures. O

There O
may O
be O
a O
lack O
of O
originality, O
but O
we O
are O
still O
happy. O

A O
good O
French B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
in O
this O
restaurant, O
a O
very O
warm O
place, B-TARGET
a O
good O
service B-TARGET
what O
to O
ask O
for O
more? O

I O
would O
be O
happy O
to O
return O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Neighborhoods B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Paris, I-TARGET
neither O
more O
nor O
less. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
just O
as O
good O
as O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Nothing O
negative O
to O
say O
about O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
it O
doesn’t O
go O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary. O

We O
were O
there O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

Good O
music B-TARGET
for O
30-40 O
years O
old. O

Great O
cocktails B-TARGET
and O
very O
nice O
barman. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
choice O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
poor O
quality O
of O
dishes. O

Very O
improved O
service B-TARGET
(slow O
and O
poorly O
organized). O

I O
won’t O
go O
back O
to O
it O
except O
for O
a O
drink, O
I O
think. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located, O
close O
to O
the O
Sacré B-TARGET
Coeur. I-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
pleasant O
but O
it O
is O
fast. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
capricioza I-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
not O
exceptional. O

For O
the O
salad, B-TARGET
my O
friend O
had O
taken O
a O
salad, O
the O
price O
was O
a O
bit O
high O
for O
a O
green O
salad O
and O
2 O
slices O
of O
vacuum O
jam. O

A O
beautiful O
place! B-TARGET

Entrances B-TARGET
to O
share: O
three O
good! O

The O
dishes: B-TARGET
be O
careful! O

The O
ridiculous O
portions. B-TARGET

Very O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

But O
not O
at O
the O
price O
level O
at O
all. O

Disappointing O
in O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

How O
can O
one O
say O
home O
cooking O
with O
these O
spartans B-TARGET
in O
the O
box, O
its O
bourguignon B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
filled O
with O
low O
pieces.....these O
decongeled O
shrimp B-TARGET
etc...french O
cuisine O
really? O

I O
came O
there O
by O
chance O
with O
my O
son O
and O
would O
no O
longer O
put O
my O
feet O
there O
unfortunately O
foreigners O
came O
too, O
the O
poor!! O
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
mediocre O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
for O
quality. O

Absolutely O
banned. O

It O
was O
not O
bad O
but O
despite O
their O
originality O
and O
their O
beautiful O
presentation, O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
disappointed O
by O
the O
dishes: B-TARGET
artichoke B-TARGET
in O
box O
(the O
boxes O
are O
below O
the O
stairs...), O
a O
little O
too O
cooked O
meat, B-TARGET
expensive O
wines. B-TARGET

That O
said, O
the O
good O
mood O
of O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
and O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
catch O
up O
somewhat O
with O
this O
mixed O
opinion. O

We’ve O
been O
there O
many O
times O
and O
we’re O
never O
disappointed, O
nor O
are O
the O
relatives O
we O
bring O
there. O

Their O
couscous B-TARGET
is O
really O
excellent. O

The O
cupcakes B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
as O
are O
the O
lambs. B-TARGET

Two O
types O
of O
vegetable O
mixture O
are O
offered O
as O
an O
accompaniment. O

The B-TARGET
chef's I-TARGET
suggestion I-TARGET
changes O
regularly O
and O
the O
latest O
in O
date, O
couscous B-TARGET
mechoui I-TARGET
is O
good. O

To O
not O
spoil O
anything, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
attentive. O

Try O
it O
and O
come O
very O
hungry. O

The O
tapas B-TARGET
are O
excellent...The O
charcuterie B-TARGET
is O
also O
of O
good O
quality. O

Everything O
made O
me O
feel O
excited...nothing O
to O
say. O

A O
pleasant O
service B-TARGET
is O
more. O

Very O
good O
address. B-TARGET

No O
bar O
or O
restaurant. O

A O
simple O
neighborhood O
coffee B-TARGET
shop I-TARGET
that O
improves O
restorative. O

Insipid O
salads B-TARGET
and O
hot O
dishes B-TARGET
(bad). O

A O
non-existent O
wine B-TARGET
list. O

The O
industrial O
dessert. B-TARGET

We O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
everything O
is O
improvised, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
skill O
either O
at O
the O
level O
of O
reception, B-TARGET
or O
at O
the O
level O
of O
service, B-TARGET
or O
at O
the O
level O
of O
cooking B-TARGET
(frozen O
dishes). B-TARGET

It’s B-TARGET
too O
loud O
for O
a O
restaurant. O

It’s O
a O
pity O
that O
they O
don’t O
want O
to O
repeat O
the O
experience. O

The O
worst O
culinary O
experience O
in O
Paris, O
with O
an O
astronomical O
addition: O
homar B-TARGET
ravioles I-TARGET
at O
20 O
euros O
(the O
ravioles O
must O
have O
at O
least O
3 O
days) O
then O
back B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cabillaud I-TARGET
not O
cooked O
on O
potatoes, B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
rocket B-TARGET
not O
fresh O
at O
47 O
euros. O

We O
didn’t O
have O
a O
dessert. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
horrible. O

to O
prohibit. O

Very O
cold O
welcome, B-TARGET
the O
boss B-TARGET
is O
very O
antipathetic O
and O
aggressive. O

We O
felt O
like O
it O
bothered O
her O
by O
asking O
for O
mayonnaise O
or O
mustard. O

The O
rumsteack B-TARGET
pad I-TARGET
ordered O
at O
the O
point O
was O
too O
cooked, O
we O
found O
a O
hair O
in O
a O
hamburger O
which O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
shock O
them. O

The O
rose B-TARGET
was O
warm. O

We O
will O
not O
go O
back O
and O
we O
will O
not O
advertise O
them. O

Obviously O
this O
restaurant O
preferred O
to O
put O
everything O
on O
the O
frame B-TARGET
at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

Hyper O
dry O
burger, B-TARGET
poorly O
cooked, O
fries B-TARGET
without O
taste O
except O
that O
of O
oil, O
hot O
beer... O
pretty O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
which O
seemed O
almost O
more O
sorry O
than O
us O
of O
the O
total O
shipwreck O
of O
that O
evening. O

Definitely O
to O
avoid. O

Ah! O

I O
forgot: O
if O
you O
find O
your O
cheeseburger B-TARGET
at O
$14.50 O
too O
dry, O
you O
are O
told O
that O
you O
could O
have O
added O
a O
salad O
leaf O
or O
a O
cornichon... O
charged O
$0.50! O

Everything O
is O
said. O

by O
Rideau. O

A O
croque B-TARGET
gentleman I-TARGET
without O
fried O
with O
salad B-TARGET
in O
sachet, O
obviously O
without O
flavor... O

I O
am O
not O
talking O
about O
the O
price. O

We O
find O
a O
chewing O
gum O
glued O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
our O
glass O
of O
water, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
does O
not O
apologize O
and O
blames O
the O
dishwasher... O
we O
do O
not O
even O
propose O
a O
commercial O
gesture, O
we O
must O
ask O
the O
manager O
who O
can O
only O
offer O
us O
a O
coffee O
(but O
we O
do O
not O
drink O
coffee...). O

Once O
again, O
this O
rest B-TARGET
seems O
to O
be O
the O
typical O
Paris O
tourist O
brewery O
that O
buys O
its O
low-quality O
products B-TARGET
from O
"metro" O
and O
makes O
them O
pay O
a O
blind! O

The O
poor O
tourist. O

We O
went O
there O
for O
lunch. O

Rapid O
and O
courteous O
welcome. B-TARGET

The O
dishes, B-TARGET
well O
presented, O
colorful O
and O
rattling, O
were O
abundant O
and O
tasty. O

Original O
and O
light O
desserts. B-TARGET

We O
did O
not O
drink O
wine, O
so O
I O
have O
no O
opinion O
on O
the O
subject. O

At O
the O
time O
when O
the O
Marais O
transforms, O
changes O
the O
face O
and O
not O
necessarily O
in O
the O
best O
sense O
of O
the O
term, O
a O
real O
discovery O
tonight!! O

A O
great O
thank O
you O
for O
this O
rich O
modern O
and O
flavorful O
cuisine, B-TARGET
also O
thank O
you O
for O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
to O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
kindness O
and O
professionalism O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
thank O
you O
and O
thank O
you O
again O

Of O
course, O
you O
pay O
for O
the O
location, B-TARGET
but O
that’s O
not O
a O
reason. O

Chucrute, B-TARGET
the O
flagship O
product, O
is O
acidic O
and O
eaten O
without O
real O
pleasure....it O
is O
a O
shame O
with O
such O
a O
potential O
not O
to O
do O
better. O

Fast O
and O
efficient O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
lacking. O

We O
found O
everything O
very O
good O
but O
the O
reception B-TARGET
not O
very O
nice O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
horrible. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
did O
not O
smile O
at O
the O
whole O
dinner, O
she O
served O
us O
the O
first O
dish O
before O
drinks, O
we O
asked O
for O
blankets O
and O
bread O
three O
times. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
for O
the O
quantity B-TARGET
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
so O
horrible O
that O
we O
found O
it O
expensive. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
place B-TARGET
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
forgotten O
and O
ignored. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
at O
all!!! O

In O
this O
quiet O
neighborhood, B-TARGET
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
eat O
outside O
under O
the O
arcades O
while O
tasting O
a O
very O
good O
seasonal O
cuisine. B-TARGET

A O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
good O
advice O
for O
the O
choice O
of O
wines. O

A O
good O
price/quality O
ratio O
for O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

to O
recommend. O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
a O
welcome, B-TARGET
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
lunch B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
at O
an O
unbeatable O
price, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
would O
deserve O
to O
be O
mentioned O
in O
the O
various O
guides. O

Excellent O
dinner, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
waitress, B-TARGET
and O
tinted O
atmosphere.. B-TARGET
We O
tested O
several O
entries O
and O
dishes.. O
No O
one O
was O
disappointed. O

to O
advise! O

A O
warm O
address, B-TARGET
with O
a O
cozy O
and O
pleasant O
setting. B-TARGET

Excellent O
tapas, B-TARGET
tasted O
with O
delicious O
cocktails, B-TARGET
and O
at O
least O
original! O

Nice O
place, B-TARGET
that’s O
what’s O
sold. O

But O
on O
the O
side O
of O
service B-TARGET
and O
organization, O
it O
is O
constant O
improvement. O

Too O
long O
waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
and O
lack O
of O
organization. O

In O
spite O
of O
its O
situation B-TARGET
and O
its O
framework, B-TARGET
really O
nothing O
exceptional O
for O
this O
"cantine"! O

Unflavored O
dishes B-TARGET
have O
exorbitant O
prices! O

We O
always O
say O
that O
you O
have O
the O
price O
posters O
on O
the O
map, B-TARGET
we O
should O
at O
least O
eat O
well. O

And O
no, O
pass O
your O
way O
and O
do O
not O
enter O
the O
pomponette, B-TARGET
c O
is O
the O
scam! O

Disappointment O
at O
the O
time O
of O
driping O
the O
thick O
and O
overwhelming O
tab, B-TARGET
my O
husband’s O
calf’s B-TARGET
liver I-TARGET
looked O
the O
same O
as O
my O
dish, O
even O
brown B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
squalots... I-TARGET
frankly O
nothing O
exceptional! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
price O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
quantity, O
good O
desserts, B-TARGET
but O
we O
will O
not O
go O
back! O

This O
address B-TARGET
has O
been O
very O
good O
for O
several O
years. O

But O
that O
was O
before. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
less O
complete, O
some O
tasty O
and O
original O
dishes O
have O
disappeared. O

Service B-TARGET
has O
deteriorated. O

No O
smiles, O
no O
warm O
welcome. B-TARGET

And O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
deteriorating, O
all O
this O
is O
becoming O
less O
and O
less O
digestive. O

It O
is O
a O
pity. O

There O
is O
no O
art O
here. O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
well O
seasoned O
and O
prepared O
with O
respect O
for O
the O
French O
cuisine. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
attentive, O
patient, O
courteous O
and O
discreet. O

Bravo O
to O

The O
terrines B-TARGET
and O
meat B-TARGET
are O
excellent, O
as O
are O
the O
Beaujolais B-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

A O
simple O
but O
tasty O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
good O
products. B-TARGET

The O
entrecôte B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
scalotes O
with O
its O
strawberry O
mushrooms O
is O
a O
delight. O

It O
is O
always O
a O
pleasure O
to O
go O
there. O

Very O
high O
prices O
for O
dishes B-TARGET
at O
the O
edible O
limit. O

I O
ate O
a O
chicken B-TARGET
for O
25 O
euros. O

A O
shameful O

At O
any O
time O
you O
can O
eat O
properly O
and O
if O
you O
stick O
to O
the O
menus B-TARGET
it O
is O
correct O
and O
at O
an O
acceptable O
rate O
given O
the O
institutional O
character O
of O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

On O
the O
map B-TARGET
it O
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
but O
the O
choice O
is O
wider. O

Welcome B-TARGET
smiling, O
quick O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
classified O
setting, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
good O
souvenir O
of O
Paris O

Really O
delicious. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
great O
in O
an O
original O
setting B-TARGET
in O
which O
you O
feel O
good. O

A O
beautiful O
book B-TARGET
full O
of O
surprises. O

This O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
and O
competent. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
and O
truffles B-TARGET
are O
served O
at O
very O
mild O
prices. O

In O
short, O
it O
is O
definitely O
one O
of O
the O
best O
bistroes O
in O
Paris. O

Everything O
was O
perfect: O
the O
welcome, B-TARGET
the O
frame, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(a O
pianist O
plays O
classical O
tracks O
between O
two O
"singing O
numbers"), O
the O
very O
good O
meal, B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
songs! B-TARGET

Having O
talented O
artists O
singing O
opera O
right O
next O
to O
us O
is O
magical! O

It O
was O
a O
great O
evening O
that O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
price. O

I O
went O
to O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant O
with O
my O
friends. O

I O
found O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
medium O
enough. O

My O
entrance B-TARGET
from O
the O
lawyer O
was O
quite O
ordinary. O

The O
dish O
of O
St. B-TARGET
James' I-TARGET
shells I-TARGET
with O
pasta O
was O
correct. O

The O
dessert O
a O
fine B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
was O
very O
medium. O

The O
cake B-TARGET
was O
cold O
and O
not O
very O
cold. O

The O
accompanying O
ice B-TARGET
was O
correct O
but O
only O
a O
small O
ball. O

We O
were O
the O
only O
guests O
during O
the O
evening. O

My O
colleagues O
were O
on O
average O
satisfied. O

My O
neighbor O
warmed O
his O
strawberries, B-TARGET
which O
were O
cold. O

So O
do O
not O
choose O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
gourmet O
meal B-TARGET
but O
to O
eat O
properly O
without O
more. O

We O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
tasted O
several O
dishes B-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
without O
refinement. O

I O
don’t O
know O
where O
he O
can O
hold O
his O
reputation. O

So O
if O
you O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
time O
and O
eat O
good O
things O
to O
avoid. O

If O
you O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
to O
be O
seen O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
place. B-TARGET

Apart O
from O
the O
unfortunate O
cuisine, B-TARGET
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

The O
master O
word O
is O
authenticity. O

The O
French B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
here. O

A O
character O
table B-TARGET
where O
you O
go O
when O
you O
appreciate O
the O
right O
things. O

The O
taste O
of O
the O
right, O
we O
adore. O

The O
spirit O
as O
you O
like O
it. O

A O
bit O
of O
noise, O
however, O
given O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
tables. O

A O
real O
feast O
makes O
it O
last. O

Very O
good O
price O
for O
this O
lovely O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
boss B-TARGET
and O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
are O
always O
smiling. O

We O
have O
tried O
many O
different O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
are O
always O
great! O

Very O
good O
price O
for O
this O
great O
restaurant. B-TARGET

and O
excellent. O

From O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
dessert O
through O
a O
very O
nice O
selection O
of O
wines. B-TARGET

All O
of O
this O
for O
less O
than O
50€ O
with O
a O
drink O
is O
great. O

Bravo O
to O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
classic O
decor B-TARGET
will O
delight O
you. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
impeccable, O
both O
diligent O
and O
discreet. O

I O
love O
those O
restaurants O
where O
we O
always O
have O
wine O
in O
our O
cup O
without O
ever O
having O
to O
touch O
the O
bottle, O
for O
me O
this O
testifies O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
always O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
you O
to O
serve O
you. O

The O
synchronization B-TARGET
(time O
to O
serve O
the O
different O
dishes) O
was O
quite O
correct. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

A O
little O
more O
vegetables O
in O
portions O
would O
be O
appreciated O
for O
our O
taste. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
was O
suitable, O
but O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
served O
a O
tantinet O
too O
hot. O

A O
perfect O
lunch! B-TARGET

The O
reception B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
irreproachable: O
friendly, O
not O
at O
all O
curled; O
young, O
generous! O

The O
reception B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
is O
like O
on O
the O
plate O
with O
a O
lunch B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
has O
no O
equal! O

Everything O
is O
refined, O
scented, O
aesthetic, O
surprising! O

A O
great O
happiness! O

A O
lot O
of O
gentleness, O
full O
of O
tastes! O

What O
else? O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excellent O
from O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
dessert. O

It O
takes O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
to O
get O
a O
seat. O

In O
fact, O
in O
the O
evening O
there O
is O
no O
reservation O
possible, O
so O
it O
is O
on O
a O
waiting O
list O
that, O
it O
seems O
in O
the O
weekend O
can O
be O
very O
long. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
cordial. O

Restaurant B-TARGET
is O
full. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
sign. O

It O
is O
a O
good O
Paris O
table. O

Recommended B-TARGET
home O
settings. O

Just O
a O
little O
disappointed O
with O
the O
seasoning. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
shortage O
of O
cooking. O

Not O
bad O
but O
too O
crushed. O

The O
perfect O
wine. B-TARGET

and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Charming O
brewery O
atmosphere B-TARGET
with O
a O
very O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
typically O
French O
and O
seasonal O
dishes B-TARGET
but O
prepared O
in O
a O
way O
a O
little O
too O
"industrial": O
For O
example, O
the O
7-hour O
gigot B-TARGET
served O
in O
coconut O
is O
boiled!!! O

Let O
us O
make O
it O
simple: O

The O
most O
: O

The O
sourcing O
of O
products B-TARGET
is O
top. O

It’s O
good, O
mastered O
and O
sometimes O
original. O

The O
Midi O
Top O

The O
least O
: O

Unpleasant O
boss, B-TARGET
bitter O
and O
haunted O

It O
is O
often O
expensive. O

“Natural” O
organic O
wines B-TARGET
are O
often O
expensive O
and O
ugly O

The O
Conclusion: O

To O
do O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
corner, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
rushing O
there, O
very O
good O
bistros O
are O
not O
what O
is O
lacking O
in O
Paris. O

Good O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
not O
exceptional, O
slow O
service. B-TARGET

It O
doesn’t O
accept O
American O
Express O
cards O
or O
restaurant O
tickets, O
but O
it O
doesn’t O
accept O
American O
Express O
cards. O

It’s O
a O
pity O
because O
the O
framework B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
for O
dinner O
with O
friends. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
fine, O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
different. O

A O
chord B-TARGET
with O
a O
chord O
without O
a O
chord. O

Instead, O
a O
kind O
of O
lemon B-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
confit I-TARGET
is O
simply O
undesirable. O

And O
when O
you O
ask O
the O
bosses O
to O
come O
to O
taste O
and O
that O
it O
is O
actually O
not O
good O
and O
that O
she O
will O
ask O
in O
the O
kitchen O
the O
problem. O

Too O
much O
lemon O
juice O
but O
no O
commercial O
gesture. O

The O
so-called O
house O
purée B-TARGET
is O
mussline, O
and O
I’m O
not O
talking O
about O
other O
vegetables B-TARGET
that O
are O
boiled O
and O
tasteless. O

I O
also O
find O
it O
unfortunate O
that O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
came O
cold. O

The O
tomato O
carpaccio B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance O
was O
good. O

The O
dessert, O
a O
strawberries B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
basil I-TARGET
was O
right. O

In O
short, O
for O
two O
people O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
rosé: O
86€ O
for O
cold O
dishes, B-TARGET
without O
flavors, O
and O
which O
do O
not O
match O
what O
is O
written O
on O
the O
card. O

This O
is O
because O
of O
the O
patron’s B-TARGET
misconception. O

Despite O
a O
nice O
terrace, B-TARGET
I O
will O
never O
put O
my O
feet O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
again. O

A O
friendly O
team, B-TARGET
real O
traditional B-TARGET
French I-TARGET
food, I-TARGET
fresh O
food, O
inventiveness O
(feet B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
pigs I-TARGET
to O
try O
:)) O
in O
recipes, O
good O
small O
wines, B-TARGET
frankly, O
it’s O
been O
4 O
times O
I’ve O
been O
there, O
and O
I’m O
always O
delighted! O

Two O
steps O
from O
the O
pantheon O
in O
addition, O
we O
say O
that O
it O
will O
be O
tourist, O
but O
not: O
a O
rather O
intimate, O
retro, O
with O
large O
mirrors, O
the O
map O
on O
an O
ancient O
ardoise, O
the O
tables O
in O
beautiful O
wood... O

A O
very O
good O
address. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
the O
formula B-TARGET
at O
$16.50. O

We O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
highlight O
of O
this O
warm O
bistro B-TARGET
is O
its O
kitchen. B-TARGET

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
served O
in O
sufficient O
quantities O
and O
warm. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
smiling O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
pleasant. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
at O
26 O
euros O
for O
entrance O
/ O
dish O
/ O
dessert O
offers O
a O
very O
satisfactory O
price/quality O
ratio. O

The O
disadvantages O
are O
the O
lack O
of O
space O
(the O
tables O
are O
small O
and O
very O
close), O
the O
rather O
noisy O
environment B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
time O
before O
being O
served O
(about O
45 O
minutes O
before O
having O
the O
entrance). O

I O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
come O
back O
and O
invite O
you O
to O
explore O
this O
place. B-TARGET

I O
went O
to O
lunch O
at O
this O
restaurant O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
December. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
but O
the O
prices O
are O
exaggerated O
even O
for O
the O
neighborhood. O

The O
employer, B-TARGET
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
is O
non-existent O
or O
even O
disinterested O
and O
unpleasant O
with O
customers. O

Very O
long O
waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
and O
poor O
service B-TARGET
that O
ruins O
the O
evening. O

Too O
many O
tables O
for O
the O
surface, O
customers O
are O
crowded. O

The O
right O
food. B-TARGET

The O
meal B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
with O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
finally O
"home O
made". O

Very O
pleasant O
and O
smiling O
maid. B-TARGET

Menu B-TARGET
at O
25€ O
very O
complete O
and O
drippery, O
unbeatable O
quality/price O
ratio O
in O
the O
neighborhood. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
the O
little O
beast, O
it O
may O
be O
a O
little O
waiting. B-TARGET

We O
will O
come O
back. O

The O
best O
place O
to O
stay B-TARGET
in O
Thailand! O

On O
my O
plate: O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
a O
delight. O

Fine, O
scented, O
with O
coconut O
milk O
in O
parchment, O
wisely O
spicy. O

Welcome B-TARGET
to O
the O
top! O

The O
alliance O
of O
Asian O
heat O
and O
all O
the O
delicacy O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
to O
the O
west. O

There O
is O
no O
longer O
waiting B-TARGET
than O
elsewhere. O

We O
feel O
guided O
in O
our O
food O
choices. O

My O
portfolio O
is O
reasonable. O

We O
paid O
56€ O
for O
3 O
entries, O
2 O
dishes O
and O
accompaniment O
and O
2 O
desserts. O

I’ve O
been O
there O
for O
years O
and O
the O
guests O
I O
brought O
have O
done O
theirs. O

Poor O
quality O
cooking, B-TARGET
certainly O
warmed O
dishes B-TARGET
several O
times, O
hygiene O
to O
desire... O

The O
servers B-TARGET
are O
difficult O
to O
understand O
and O
especially O
unfriendly! O

We O
cannot O
say O
that O
the O
framework B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
should O
be O
avoided. O

Nice O
neighborhood O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
well-parisian O
setting B-TARGET
with O
all O
these O
posters O
on O
the O
walls. O

We’re O
a O
bit O
tight O
but O
your O
neighbors O
are O
always O
nice O
and O
some O
have O
what’s O
called O
“a O
head.” O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
has O
a O
good O
price/quality O
ratio. O

Nothing O
gastronomic, O
of O
course, O
but O
terroir O
cuisine.We B-TARGET
come O
here O
to O
spend O
a O
good O
time O
with O
friends O
without O
ruining O
and O
we O
come O
back O
with O
pleasure. O

I O
have O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
and O
waitresses B-TARGET
were O
nice O
and O
everything O
was O
very O
well O
organized, O
there O
was O
no O
pressure O
at O
all, O
on O
the O
contrary O
they O
were O
all O
very O
cool O
despite O
the O
ton O
of O
dishes O
they O
had O
to O
serve! O

The O
current O
went O
very O
well O
with O
us O
and O
yet O
we O
were O
a O
large O
table O
of O
12 O
very O
active O
people! O

Some O
saw O
their O
lamb B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
not O
cooked O
well O
so O
2 O
bottles O
of O
red O
were O
offered O
to O
us O
in O
compensation. O

I O
took O
a O
net B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
morillas, I-TARGET
it O
was O
quite O
delicious O
and O
cooked O
as O
needed, O
perfect. O

House O
fries B-TARGET
are O
also O
a O
delight. O

I O
also O
recommend O
you O
to O
try O
the O
mojito, B-TARGET
a O
large O
glass O
for O
5€, O
super O
good. O

We O
arrived O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
full, O
even O
on O
the O
terrace, O
so O
a O
tip: O
book O
in O
advance! O

For O
most O
of O
us, O
we O
found O
our O
QG O
of O
the O
quai O
de O
Seine! O

A O
welcoming O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
chef B-TARGET
and O
his B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
smiling. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

If O
I O
had O
lived O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
a O
good O
chance O
for O
me O
to O
make O
it O
my O
evening O
dining O
room. O

A O
bistro O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
very O
careful, O
some O
traditional B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
excellently O
revisited. O

The O
pot B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
fire I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
cheeks I-TARGET
is O
to O
fall O
to O
the O
ground! O

Delightful O
at O
the O
palace, O
they O
are O
also O
very O
pleasant O
in O
sight. O

Bravo O
to! O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
dirty, O
industrial O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
poor O
quality, O
unfriendly O
staff, B-TARGET
nothing O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
acceptable. O

to O
escape. O

We O
went, O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
friends, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
warm, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
very O
nice. O

The O
couscous B-TARGET
and O
tajines B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
accompanied O
by O
a O
good O
Moroccan B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
from O
the O
sympathies O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
and O
mint B-TARGET
tea, I-TARGET
a O
very O
pleasant O
evening. O

Good O
quality O
price O
ratio. O

We O
went O
there O
on O
May O
14 O
with O
our O
son. O

Good O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
nothing O
extraordinary, O
lotte, O
pintade... O

A O
children's B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
with O
only O
one O
choice O
of O
dishes O
and O
not O
possible O
to O
have O
anything O
else, O
we O
had O
to O
order O
the O
pintade B-TARGET
much O
too O
abundant O
for O
an O
8-year-old O
who O
new O
summer O
counted O
as O
an O
adult O
dish O
at O
25 O
euros! O

A O
very O
expensive O
poultry. B-TARGET

Short O
140 O
euros O
to O
3 O
with O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine O
and O
a O
limonade O
is O
too O
much O
for O
a O
very O
simple O
lunch. B-TARGET

A O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
who, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
is O
not O
a O
professional. O

The O
Bretton O
Boss B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

Very O
friendly, O
it O
is O
more O
than O
a O
restaurant, O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
family. O

Food B-TARGET
and O
wine, B-TARGET
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

Despite O
the O
goodwill O
of O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
feels O
quite O
poorly O
organized. O

In O
fact, O
between O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
arrive O
late O
and O
those O
that O
are O
not O
cooked O
as O
requested, O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
annoying. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
good O
and O
good O
quality O
however O
and O
the O
place, B-TARGET
even O
though O
a O
bit O
dark O
to O
my O
taste, O
is O
not O
unpleasant. O

Improve O
it O
so O
that O
it O
becomes O
a O
good O
place. B-TARGET

We O
visited O
this O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
a O
lot, O
but O
there O
it O
dropped O
a O
lot. O

We O
go O
back O
with O
a O
wolf O
hunger O
because O
the O
plates B-TARGET
are O
tiny, O
and O
the O
addition..., O
very O
salty... O

The O
dishes O
are O
not O
bad, O
but O
there O
is O
so O
much O
better O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
as O
Thai O
restaurant! O

Avoid O
holding O
your O
currency O
at O
your O
door. O

This O
is O
a O
beautiful O
place, B-TARGET
and O
that’s O
all O
I O
can O
write O
about. O

An O
inexistent O
and O
totally O
messy O
service; B-TARGET
a O
boss B-TARGET
who O
spends O
more O
time O
chatting O
with O
his O
friends O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
restaurant O
room O
than O
doing O
his O
job. O

An O
atmosphere B-TARGET
that O
wants O
to O
be O
bobo O
/ O
parisian O
but O
then O
floats O
on O
the O
decline O
seen O
the O
panel O
(age) O
of O
the O
room. O

As O
for O
food, B-TARGET
it O
is O
horrible. O

To O
avoid O
absolutely. O

A O
great O
meal B-TARGET
mixing O
American O
flavors O
and O
knowing O
how O
to O
make O
French O
from O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
dessert. O

We O
were O
5 O
and O
tasted O
2 O
entries, B-TARGET
5 O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
4 O
desserts, B-TARGET
all O
excellent O
and O
very O
well O
prepared, O
especially O
the O
entries. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
warm O
and O
original O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
without O
false O
notes O
and O
friendly O
is O
quite O
quick.The O
selection O
of O
wines B-TARGET
is O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
card O
and O
the O
price O
with O
yours O
;). O

To O
recommend, O
excellent O
dishes, B-TARGET
irreproachable O
quality, O
interesting O
quality/price O
ratio. O

Our O
choice, O
duck O
magret, B-TARGET
delicious, O
cassoulet, B-TARGET
excellent O
and O
lamb B-TARGET
shells I-TARGET
to O
lick O
the O
babies. O

Desserts B-TARGET
are O
not O
left, O
charlotte O
to O
shoco, O
lost O
bread O
and O
gourmet O
coffee. O

Highly O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
and O
good O
advice. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
there!! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
warm, O
the O
service B-TARGET
"at O
the O
right O
franquette". O

Good O
price O
for O
the O
neighborhood. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
frankly O
had O
nothing O
exceptional: O
vegetables B-TARGET
not O
cooked O
enough, O
a O
lamb B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
served O
in O
large O
portions, O
without O
any O
finesse. O

Good O
choice O
of O
wines. B-TARGET

A O
romantic O
dinner O
after O
dinner O
is O
a O
must. O

At O
two O
o’clock, O
an O
appetizer O
turns O
into O
dinner. O

Small O
summer O
salad, B-TARGET
simple O
fresh O
and O
cheap. O

Tiramisu B-TARGET
has I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
effective O
strawberries O
at O
the O
end O
of O
dinner. O

Great O
service, B-TARGET
very O
young O
team. O

One O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
has O
the O
physique O
of O
a O
15-year-old O
boy O
;) O
but O
very O
dynamic O
and O
nice. O

I O
often O
came O
there O
a O
few O
years O
ago, O
in O
the O
summer O
on O
large O
tables O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
to O
share O
great O
moments O
with O
my O
family. O

It’s O
a O
pity O
that O
I O
couldn’t O
find O
that O
spirit O
tonight. O

It’s O
a O
very O
popular O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
it’s O
been O
a O
long O
time. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
remains O
the O
same O
as O
before O
and O
it O
has O
its O
charm. O

But O
in O
the O
dish O
no O
kitchen, B-TARGET
industrial O
heating O
as O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
company! O

Very O
nice O
service, B-TARGET
but O
that’s O
the O
only O
positive. O

So O
go O
to O
a O
brewery, O
you O
will O
be O
less O
disappointed. O

Very O
affordable, O
prices O
that O
cool, O
a O
welcome B-TARGET
more O
than O
average. O

And O
as O
a O
bonus O
when O
a O
server B-TARGET
walks O
on O
your O
business O
and O
breaks O
something, O
no O
excuse, O
you O
get O
the O
note O
very O
quickly... O

And O
when O
we O
at O
least O
apologize, O
we O
go O
crazy O
with O
our O
thighs O
and O
we O
are O
"gentily" O
begged O
not O
to O
return O
(to O
make O
it O
short). O

I’t O
put O
my O
feet O
on O
it O
anymore!! O

It O
is O
a O
shame! O

Even O
looking O
carefully O
we O
still O
do O
not O
find O
any O
positive O
points O
to O
this O
meal! O

Very O
slow O
and O
messy O
service, B-TARGET
frozen O
and O
poor O
cooking, B-TARGET
banal O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
a O
child O
can O
prepare O
and O
that O
don’t O
put O
in O
appetite... O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
service B-TARGET
and O
waiting. B-TARGET

0 O
on O
the O
whole O
line. O

Never O
again O
tourists O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
establishment. B-TARGET

I O
took O
a O
tartar B-TARGET
cut O
with O
the O
knife O
but O
the O
beef B-TARGET
was O
of O
very O
poor O
quality, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
all O
fiber O
and O
hard O
and O
the O
dish B-TARGET
had O
no O
taste. O

I O
love O
to O
eat O
tartar, B-TARGET
but O
I O
haven’t O
eaten O
any O
of O
it. O

It O
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
bad. O

A O
friend O
recommended O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
he O
was O
right. O

Very O
warm O
welcome, O
impeccable O
service, B-TARGET
the O
managers B-TARGET
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
just O
magnificent, O
one O
can O
even O
go O
with O
small O
pots O
or O
ingredients O
used O
by O
the O
restaurant O
that O
are O
sold O
at O
the O
exit. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O

The O
hospitality B-TARGET
is O
really O
friendly, O
it O
is O
a O
small O
paradise O
when O
you O
are O
on O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it. O

Unfortunately, O
I O
hadn’t O
read O
the O
reviews O
before O
deciding O
our O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
a O
mistake! O

That O
makes O
me O
very O
uncomfortable O
for O
this O
opinion O
despite O
my O
conciliatory O
nature. O

The O
menu O
is O
39€ O

The O
aperitif O
included O
is O
not O
served O
to O
us O
and O
the O
entries O
are O
brought O
precipitately O
so O
far O
nothing O
too O
serious... O
foie B-TARGET
gras I-TARGET
and O
salmon B-TARGET
correct O
then O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
to O
have O
the O
dishes: O
a O
tartar O
and O
a O
pepper O
paddle O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
to O
be O
of O
the O
correct O
quality O
sensible O
to O
be O
a O
selection O
Hugo O
Desnoyer O
(bad O
idea O
to O
let O
abuse O
so O
its O
products) O
but O
if O
the O
tartar B-TARGET
is O
edible O
although O
little O
seasoned O
the O
paddle B-TARGET
is O
cooked O
to O
him O
way O
soil O
dry O
and O
carbonated O
but O
actually O
bleeding O
to O
the O
heart, O
a O
exploit O
and O
the O
oil O
used O
for O
the O
fries B-TARGET
did O
not O
have O
to O
be O
filtered O
so O
they O
are O
rather O
good O
but O
gray... O

Again O
30 O
to O
40 O
minutes O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
for O
desserts B-TARGET
that O
are O
not O
edible O
and O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
2nd O
bite B-TARGET
fine I-TARGET
cake O
with O
too O
cold O
apples O
and O
vanilla B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
arrived O
half O
melted O
and O
for O
my O
husband O
crêpes B-TARGET
carded... O

The O
errors O
are O
multiplied O
on O
three O
tables O
of O
nearby O
customers. O

Let O
us O
quickly O
pass O
on O
the O
water O
carafe O
arrived O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
meal O
and O
the O
wine O
never O
served O
the O
music B-TARGET
in O
a O
rave O
way O
not O
suited O
and O
not O
to O
finish O
a O
gesture O
on O
the O
addition O
to O
make O
us O
more O
indulgence? O

The O
friendly O
framework B-TARGET
and O
a O
little O
professionalism O
could O
straighten O
the O
bar O
but O
at O
the O
moment O
the O
price O
ratio O
is O
really O
exaggerating. O

Take O
your O
way! O

From O
worse O
to O
worse... O
this O
crêperie B-TARGET
that O
we O
have O
been O
with O
for O
almost O
10 O
years O
has O
gained O
in O
decoration B-TARGET
as O
much O
as O
it O
has O
lost O
in O
taste O
and O
quality O
in O
the O
plates... B-TARGET

Cakes B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cookies I-TARGET
that O
arrive O
2min30 O
after O
placing O
the O
order...very O
dry...no O

and O
especially O
a O
night O
of O
stomach O
cramps O
for O
the O
4 O
people O
who O
were O
around O
the O
table, O
just O
20min O
after O
dinner!!! O

We O
regret O
the O
good O
crêperie B-TARGET
of O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
will O
finally O
not O
return O
to O
it O
again! O

Despite O
a O
sunny O
and O
green O
terrace B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
on O
beautiful O
days...DOMMAGE O

The O
village O
restaurant. O

Welcome, B-TARGET
but O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
service. B-TARGET

We O
only O
tasted O
the O
pizzas. B-TARGET

Very O
reasonable O
rates. O

Ultra O
slow O
service, B-TARGET
waitresses B-TARGET
without O
smiles O
or O
minimal O
kindness, O
need O
to O
claim O
the O
card, O
cake B-TARGET
egg I-TARGET
jambon I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
without O
taste O
and O
sad O
presentation. O

Great O
effort O
to O
do O
on O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

What O
a O
terrible O
memory! O

We O
were O
attracted O
like O
other O
people O
by O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
and O
the O
low O
prices. O

But O
once O
we O
were O
installed O
it O
was O
a O
disaster. O

We O
asked O
for O
Coca-Cola O
and O
we O
were O
served O
discount O
soda B-TARGET
without O
telling O
us, O
which O
is O
more O
it O
was O
hot. O

When O
we O
noticed O
it, O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
did O
not O
seem O
to O
understand. O

We O
ordered O
a O
menu. O

The O
entrance B-TARGET
was O
very O
small, O
especially O
salad. O

Then O
the O
waitress O
and O
her O
husband O
the O
cook O
started O
talking O
next O
to O
our O
table O
of O
their O
son O
who O
was O
sick O
and O
who O
could O
not O
go O
to O
the O
toilet O
(they O
said O
rough O
words O
in O
front O
of O
us). O

It O
made O
us O
so O
upset O
that O
we O
left O
before O
we O
even O
waited O
for O
the O
main O
dish. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
laughed O
as O
we O
explained O
to O
her O
not O
appreciating O
their O
conversation, O
so O
we O
understood O
the O
seriousness O
of O
the O
establishment. O

I O
totally O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
mediocre O
restaurant B-TARGET
or O
unfortunately O
many O
foreign O
tourists O
get O
trapped. O

The O
toilets O
were O
dirty. O

I O
noticed O
a O
small O
inscription O
that O
indicated O
that O
their O
duck B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
came O
from O
the O
countries O
of O
the O
East, O
a O
comble O
for O
the O
country O
of O
the O
cassoulet. O

This O
inscription O
was O
well O
hidden O
inside O
the O
property O
so O
that O
guests O
on O
the O
terrace O
could O
not O
see O
it. O

I O
do O
not O

restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
had O
come O
at O
noon O
with O
my O
friend O
who O
had O
a O
very O
good O
memory O
of O
this O
restaurant O
and O
so O
insisted O
on O
the O
"topissime". O

We O
greeted O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
table, O
which O
for O
restaurants B-TARGET
is O
the O
big O
deal, O
we O
seemed O
to O
bother O
them, O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
that, O
the O
customers O
were O
blowing O
them O
up, O
clearly! O

No O
politeness O
and O
installation O
at O
a O
dirty O
table O
that O
remained O
even O
when O
we O
sat. O

During O
the O
meal, O
we O
saw O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
disgusted O
by O
his O
work O
(or O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
his O
work); O
the O
"master", B-TARGET
in O
any O
case, O
the O
one O
who O
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
higher O
position, O
was O
the O
one O
who O
was O
most O
unpleasant. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
intolerable. O

dishes B-TARGET
without O
passion, O
broken O
dishes, O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
( O
crustacean O
rice O
in O
bulk O
) O
very O
dry, O
no O
sauce, O
no O
fresh O
gambas, B-TARGET
a O
poor O
decoration B-TARGET
superfluous... O
in O
short O
no O
taste. O

If O
only O
they O
could O
have O
picked O
up O
the O
staff!! B-TARGET

Next O
time, O
there O
will O
be O
no O
one O
here. O

We O
came O
in O
May O
2013 O
(I O
put O
February O
2014 O
but O
we O
can’t O
go O
back O
before) O
and O
I O
only O
post O
today, O
but O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
is O
not O
one, O
made O
me O
so O
hallucinated, O
(because O
yes O
people O
open O
a O
rest O
having O
absolutely O
nothing O
understood O
in O
the O
business) O
that O
I O
promised O
myself O
to O
raise O
it!! O
and O
I O
promise O
myself O
the O
next O
time O
to O
leave O
the O
restaurant O
from O
the O
beginning! O

It O
should O
be O
forbidden O
to O
pay O
for O
it. O

It O
is O
an O
insult O
to O
the O
art O
of O
cooking. O

Could O
the O
explanation O
for O
this O
disaster O
come O
from O
an O
unscrupulous O
reader? O

In O
the O
meantime, O
I O
see O
positive O
opinions, O
which O
makes O
me O
doubtful. O

At O
the O
festival O
of O
the O
boats, O
we O
arrived O
on O
this O
plateau O
by O
chance. O

We O
were O
seduced O
by O
the O
front O
door O
of O
this O
unpretentious O
little O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
very O
good O
dinner. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
taken O
was O
typical O
of O
the O
region O
(goat O
honey O
salad, O
seiche O
with O
seitoise O
and O
its O
excellent O
rizotto....). B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
very O
good. O

We O
will O
come O
back O
with O
great O
pleasure. O

After O
visiting O
it O
twice, O
I O
am O
not O
convinced. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
not O
tip-top, O
neither O
is O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
great. O

In O
fact, O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
too O
cooked, O
poorly O
seasoned, O
a O
pity O
for O
an O
Italian O
rest. O

It’s O
a O
pity, O
even O
if O
the O
bread B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

and O
disappointed. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
really O
dull, O
without O
flavor. O

For O
someone O
who O
knows O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
cuisine O
see O
spicy O
in O
general, O
it O
goes O
but O
for O
others O
you O
will O
be O
disappointed. O

It O
is O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

I O
went O
there O
2 O
times O
to O
be O
sure, O
but O
every O
time O
the O
disappointment O
(varied O

meat B-TARGET
(I O
had O
once O
taken O
beef, O
once O
lamb) O
filled O
with O
small O
pieces O
of O
fat. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
good O
Indian B-TARGET
restaurant. I-TARGET

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
simply O
excellent, O
especially O
the O
specialty O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
the O
linguini B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
shrews. I-TARGET

The O
boss B-TARGET
has O
a O
lot O
of O
humor O
and O
is O
pleased O
to O
animate O
the O
room. O

and O
a O
pearl. O

Everyone O
knew O
it O
except O
us. O

I O
have O
to O
do O
this O
to O
avoid O
the O
massacre O
of O
others. O

However, O
when O
at O
20hoo O
in O
a O
rest B-TARGET
it O
is O
empty O
it O
is O
that O
it O
is O
loose... O
But O
we O
had O
not O
badly O
turned O
and O
the O
remains O
of O
Metz O
was O
complete.... O

Honestly, O
Mac O
do O
would O
have O
arranged O
me O
well O
I O
regret O
to O
say O
I O
never O
go O
there O
but O
I O
should O
have O
thought O
about O
it. O

a O

What O
a O
waste. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
kind, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
or O
chief O
is O
not O
professional. O

There O
is O
no O
sense O
of O
humor O
in O
what O
you O
want O
in O
a O
good O
restaurant. O

The O
goal O
is O
to O
make O
the O
terrace O
more O
profitable. O

So O
you O
eat O
and O
above O
all O
you O
do O
not O
delay O
and O
you O
are O
made O
to O
understand O
it O
well. O

There O
is O
no O
explanation O
on O
the O
dishes. O

an O
unpleasant O
limit. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back. O

The O
frame B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
class O
but O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
quality. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
time O
we O
go O
there O
between O
2 O
p.m. O
and O
a O
little O
disappointed O
compared O
to O
the O
first O
time. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
impeccable O

the O

pleasant. O

going O
there O

at O

I O
am O
rarely O

and O
the O

at O

top, O
I O

Lunch B-TARGET
abundant, O
generous O
and O
pretty O
good. O

Gentle O
but O
overwhelmed O
boss B-TARGET
(success O
obliges) O
hence O
a O
certain O
expectation O
that O
remains O
tolerable. O

I O
don’t O
think O
you’ll O
find O
the O
best O
citizens O
in O
the O
city, O
but O
they’re O
quite O
right. O

Located O
not O
far O
from O
my O
office, O
I O
go O
there O
quite O
regularly, O
during O
another O
passage O
I O
had O
been O
disappointed O
and O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
stay O
on O
a O
bad O
impression O
because O
in O
the O
restaurant O
it O
can O
have O
days O
without, O
I O
decide O
to O
go O
there O
with O
several O

by O
+++++ O

We O
went O
out O
to O
eat O
with O
friends. O

We O
found O
expensive O
prices O
for O
a O
popular O
neighborhood O
restaurant; B-TARGET
that O
frozen O

And O
no O

if O
you O
are O
still O
hungry. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it. O

The O

the O
usual O
(office O
companies), O
the O
others O
pass O
after... O

Entry, B-TARGET

we O
loved. O

A O
very O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
great O
view B-TARGET
of O
St. O
Stephen's O
Cathedral, O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
welcoming! O

to O
recommend! O

To O
do O
before O
the O
closure O
because O
it O
is O
a O
mythical O
place B-TARGET
of O
Lille. O

A O
little O
disappointed O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
(a O
lot O
of O
false O
steps O
that O
we O
should O
not O
see O
in O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant: O
we O
even O
managed O
ourselves O
to O
pick O
up O
our O
coats O
and O
get O
out O
of O
the O
restaurant), O
amazed O
by O
the O
framework, B-TARGET
and O
the O
wine B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
but O
I O
stayed O
on O
my O
hunger O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes! B-TARGET

It’s O
a O
pity, O
but O
I O
could O
say, O
“I O
was O
there.” O

We O
went O
there O
at O
noon, O
we O
didn’t O
have O
much O
time O
to O
eat O
(like O
most O
other O
guests). O

Our O
order: O
steak O
tartare, O
chef O
salad O
and O
san O
pellegrino... O
cold O
dishes O
normally O
fast O
to O
make. O

... O
by O

All O
the O
tables O
around, O
arriving O
after O
us, O
got O
their O
order O
quickly O
and O
strangely O
for O
us. O

So O
my O
friend O
will O
take O
news O
from O
our O
dishes, O
stating O
that O
we’re O
in O
a O
hurry, O
“I’ll O
see O
where O
it’s O
going” O
and O
then O
radio O
silence. O

15 O
minutes O
later O
I O
go O
back O
and O
say, O
“The O
next O
meal O
will O
be O
yours, O
don’t O
worry.” O

After O
four O
months, O
there O
is O
no O
trace O
of O
our O
dishes. O

... O
by O

After O
40 O
minutes O
of O
waiting, B-TARGET
we O
decided O
to O
leave. O

I O
explain O
why O
to O
a O
waitress O
who O
was O
in O
the O
process O
of O
cashing O
and O
cherry O
on O
the O
cake: O
she O
charges O
us O
the O
bottle O
of O
water O
without O
an O
excuse!! O

A O
waitress O
will O
pick O
us O
up O
at O
the O
exit O
to O
apologize O
and O
tell O
us O
that O
our O
dishes O
are O
about O
to O
arrive: O
"I'm O
too O
late O
to O
go O
back O
to O
work O
in O
15 O
minutes!" O

It's O
a O
pity O
because O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
looked O
very O
good O
unlike O
the O
triangle O
sandwiches O
from O
the O
supermarket O
that O
we O
had O
to O
eat O
in O
speed O
on O
the O
street!! O

I O
can O
understand O
that O
we O
have O
forgotten, O
mistakes O
happen, O
but O
there O
are O
ways O
to O
get O
the O
pill O
passed. O

We O
will O
not O
put O
our O
feet O
there O
anymore. O

We O
are O
not O
here O
in O
a O
restaurant O
for O
tourists, O
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
simple O
and O
sober, O
even O
a O
little O
too O
much O
to O
my O
taste, O
I O
who O
likes O
cozy O
interiors O
and O
chic O
pits, O
the O
wine O
map O
on O
an O
A5 O
sheet O
folded O
into O
two O
rejects O
me O
a O
little O
at O
first. O

But O
we O
are O
not O
here O
either O
for O
that, O
but O
to O
eat O
the O
rhinos B-TARGET
that O
apparently O
made O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
remainder O
of O
the O
old O
lille O
here. O

The O
famous O
dishes O
come, O
neither O
too O
early O
nor O
too O
long. O

It’s O
not O
bad O
at O
all, O
we O
understand O
their O
success, O
even O
if O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
little O
more O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
garniture. B-TARGET

Dessert: O
Chtiterolles O
and O
gourmet O
coffee. O

My O
husband O
really O
liked O
his O
good O
and O
consistent O
dessert. B-TARGET

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
cream. B-TARGET

I O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
there O
to O
eat O
a O
dish O
that O
comes O
out O
of O
what O
can O
be O
done O
in O
the O
old O
lille O
to O
catch O
the O
tourist, O
even O
if O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
few O
euros O
less O
on O
the O
addition. O

Finally, O
contrary O
to O
what O
I O
could O
read O
here, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
clean O
during O
my O
passage. O

Address O
tested O
during O
a O
team O
meal O
(thus O
large O
table). O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
clean O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
correct, O
although O
a O
bit O
long O
(but O
maybe O
there O
was O
a O
lack O
of O
staff O
that O
day). O

I O
having O
different O
blankets O
for O
the O
entrance O
and O
dish O
(because O
how O
many O
restaurants O
now O
leave O
you O
the O
same O
blankets!) O

The O
content O
of O
the O
plates. B-TARGET

My O
choice O
had O
been O
on O
country O
terrine, O
Flemish O
carbonate, O
and O
a O
lost O
brioche O
with O
a O
caramel O
ice O
ball. O

The O
entrance B-TARGET
and O
the O
dish B-TARGET
were O
pretty O
classic O
(with O
a O
smoothie O
for O
the O
tasteless O
salad) B-TARGET
but O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
good. O

My O
colleagues O
were O
also O
satisfied O
with O
their O
dishes B-TARGET
as O
a O
whole. O

Testing O
without O
hesitation. O

We O
took O
the O
peanut B-TARGET
butter I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
grapes, I-TARGET
these O
bathed O
in O
cream O
and O
balsamic O
cream! O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
oil. O

We O
also O
ate O
the O
risotto B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
St. I-TARGET
James I-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
rich O
in O
cream! O

And O
the O
St. B-TARGET
James I-TARGET
were O
rubbery! O

We O
walked O
out O
of O
there. O

very O
disappointing. O

If O
the O
score O
is O
low O
(61.90) O
for O
a O
meal B-TARGET
and O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
month. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
poor. O

We O
had O
never O
had O
a O
goat O
of O
marinated B-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
half O
of O
which O
was O
in O
salad. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
not O
home, O
which O
is O
felt O
on O
the O
taste. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
medium. O

The O
absence O
of O
customers O
of O
the O
cru O
was O
a O
good O
indication, O
trapped! O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
place B-TARGET
with O
my O
friend O
or O
have O
a O
good O
time O
while O
eating O
well, O
this O
was O
the O
perfect O
place! O
and O
we O
also O
drank O
well, O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
a O
similar O
name, O
it O
seems O
normal... O

The O
manager B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
without O
hesitation. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
with O
my O
lover. O

We O
had O
lunch O
at O
this O
small O
restaurant. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
but O
the O
space B-TARGET
is O
limited O
if O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
lunch O
on O
site. O

The O
advantage O
is O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
take O
dishes O
with O
you. O

I O
bought O
a O
“galette” B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
(galette O
+ O
crêpe O
+ O
cider O
bolé O
for O
9€40). O

This O
is O
a O
good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

The O
cookies B-TARGET
are O
abundant O
and O
the O
crêpes B-TARGET
excellent, O
fine O
and O
light. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
and O
a O
day B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
are O
also O
offered. O

A O
good O
rest B-TARGET
when O
you O
know O
how O
many O
remains O
are O
on O
the O
street. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
for O
tourists. O

It O
has O
a O
good O
quality-price O
ratio. O

Do O
you O
think O
everything O
is O
fresh? O

It O
is O
good O
and O
well O
cooked. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
sympathetic. O

Perfect O
for O
a O
little O
trip O
with O
friends O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

I O
recommend O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
stopped O
by O
chance O
and O
returned O
conquered. O

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
bulky O
but O
this O
is O
normal O
since O
everything O
is O
fresh O
and O
cooked O
on O
site. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
dessert O
was O
excellent. O

The O
price O
of O
the O
wine B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the O
glass O
is O
too O
expensive. O

Very O
well O
situated O
in O
front O
of O
the O
aquarium. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
and O
lounge O
decor B-TARGET
rather O
cozy. O

But O
what O
was O
on O
my O
plate B-TARGET
was O
danger. O

I O
raised O
the O
cover O
of O
my O
burger O
to O
check O
and O
fell O
on O
salad B-TARGET
leaves I-TARGET
all O
flattered O
not O
to O
say O
worse O
than O
that. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
were O
almost O
transformed O
into O
purée O
so O
they O
were O
impregnated O
with O
fat. O

by O
Beurk. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
fragile O
health, O
go O
your O
way. O

We O
wanted O
fried O
molds O
and O
we O
were O
a O
little O
disappointed: O
too O
cooked O
(or O
even O
re-cooked), O
dry O
and O
dull O
molds. B-TARGET

This O
is O
not O
the O
season, O
we O
will O
not O
do O
it O
again. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
and O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
were O
mediocre. O

A O
good O
map, B-TARGET
but O
more O
to O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
day, O
without O
too O
much O
evolution. O

Very O
nice O
setting B-TARGET
mainly O
in O
ext O
despite O
a O
lack O
of O
gardeners. O

The O
lunch O
menu B-TARGET
in O
the O
week O
is O
very O
affordable, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excellent. O

Service B-TARGET
of O
good O
level. O

Exceptional O
setting; B-TARGET
the O
room O
is O
in O
an O
old O
rebuilt O
abbey. O

I O
have O
not O
been O
in O
this O
establishment O
for O
two O
months O
because O
of O
leaving O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
that O
is O
no O
longer O
up O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
chain. O

What O
is O
regularly O
missed O
are O
the O
cooking O
of O
the O
meats: B-TARGET
from O
blue O
coming O
cold O
to O
barely O
defrosted O
to O
the O
center, O
the O
bleeding O
just O
blue, O
etc... O
the O
chips B-TARGET
offered O
at O
the O
entrance O
were O
infected: O
oily O
like O
sponges O
and O
with O
the O
taste O
of O
burned. O

In O
short, O
if O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
does O
not O
regain O
itself O
it O
will O
lose O
its O
regular O
clientele O
(the O
passers O
will O
be O
trapped O
but O
this O
is O
harmful O
to O
the O
entire O
chain). O

We O
noticed O
these O
negligences O
three O
times O
before O
we O
made O
the O
decision O
not O
to O
put O
our O
feet O
back O
on O
them. O

Limoges O
is O
incomparably O
better. O

In O
addition, O
we O
waited O
a O
very O
long O
time O
for O
a O
carafe O
of O
water O
and O
the O
sauce O
supposed O
to O
accompany O
the O
meat O
during O
our O
last O
test. O

Very O
disappointing O
compared O
to O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
past. O

Only O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
correct O
in O
Q/P O
ratio, O
the O
entries B-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
unequal O
in O
terms O
of O
them. O

Very O
disappointed, O
little O
kindness, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
hygiene O
is O
not O
on O
the O
appointment O
(separate O
and O
greasy O
hair O
waitress) O
the O
cook O
is O
surprised O
by O
being O
stabbing O
in O
the O
dishes O
with O
his O
fingers, O
very O
dirty O
dishes, O
pre-cooked O
meat, O
unflavored O
food, B-TARGET
bread O
sold O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
free O
service O
in O
the O
room. O

Go O
your O
way, O
it’s O
better O
not O
to O
recommend. O

Refined O
and O
generous O
kitchen B-TARGET
that O
works O
with O
quality O
products. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant! O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
become O
our O
favorite O
on O
Poitiers, O
so O
we O
highly O
recommend O
it!!! O

Really O
delighted O
very O
nice O
resto, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
with O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
listening O
and O
very O
good O
advice, O
level O
meal B-TARGET
really O
very O
good O
nothing O
to O
regret. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
little O
rest O
to O
everyone. O

I O
think O
to O
return O
there O
very O
soon O
as O
a O
couple O
this O
time O
because O
the O
setting B-TARGET
and O
beautiful, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
very O
warm O

We O
were O
very O
well O
received O
by O
a O
nice O
waitress, B-TARGET
but O
the O
rest O
was O
a O
terrible O
experience. O

40 O
minutes O
watch O
in O
hand O
for O
with O
a O
damaged O
salad B-TARGET
and O
warm O
legs B-TARGET
that O
should O
have O
at O
least O
3 O
days. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
dry O
and O
roasted. O

Bad O
quality/price O
ratio O

The O
framework B-TARGET
is O
charming, O
well O
arranged O
and O
convivial! O

The O
friendly O
owner B-TARGET
and O
the O
wines B-TARGET
served O
in O
glass O
or O
bottle O
are O
good..a O
lot O
of O
originality O
in O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
proposed, O
by O
the O
way, O
very O
good... O

A O
bit O
expensive O
though. O

Brunch O
delivery B-TARGET
at O
home O
is O
really O
a O
genius O
idea! O

If O
you O
add O
to O
this O
fresh O
products, B-TARGET
flavors O
and O
original O
recipes, B-TARGET
this O
is O
paradise! O

The O
prices O
are O
also O
very O
reasonable O
(20 O
euros O
for O
the O
highest O
formula, O
delivery O
included) O
and O
the O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
more O
than O
duplicate. O

Homemade B-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
are O
a O
delight, O
I O
recommend O
prune B-TARGET
- I-TARGET
fenouil, I-TARGET
unusual O
but O
divine O
association! O

This O
place B-TARGET
would O
deserve O
to O
be O
open O
more O
often O
and O
have O
more O
space O
and O
staff. O

Because O
bagels B-TARGET
change O
the O
usual O
snacks, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

But O
this O
gentle O
boss B-TARGET
is O
quickly O
overwhelmed. O

These O
bagels B-TARGET
are O
good, O
little O
choice O
but O
qualities, O
and O
she O
always O
has O
the O
smile O
and O
the O
nice O
word. O

If O
they O
improve O
some O
points O
it O
can O
quickly O
be O
a O
victim O
of O
its O
success O
go O
see O
it O
if O
you O
are O
curious. O

A O
nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
on O
the O
thumb O
at O
noon O
away O
from O
the O
usual O
fat O
and O
snacks O
that O
we O
get O
tired O
of. O

Great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
with O
top O
friends. O

After O
midnight, O
people O
smoke O
cigarettes O
in O
the O
bar. O

We O
even O
saw O
a O
waitress O
smoking O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

Recommended O
for O
our O
group O
of O
friends! O

A B-TARGET
place O
to O
avoid O
in O
the O
evening O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
family O
because O
apparently O
there O
are O
sometimes O
themed O
evenings O
and O
then O
the O
organizers O
(not O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
place) O
made O
us O
understand O
that O
we O
had O
to O
leave. O

very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Excellent O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
deco. B-TARGET

Change O
with O
a O
new O
card. O

Hamburgers, B-TARGET
juicy O
pizzas, B-TARGET
brushettas, B-TARGET
and O
an O
exceptional O
Milanese B-TARGET
scalope. I-TARGET

You O
will O
be O
delighted. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
really O
good! O

The O
chef O
does O
not O
shoot O
at O
the O
merchandise: O
a O
well-garnished O
pizza! B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
smiling O
and O
available. O

The O
chef O
speaks O
(cries) O
a O
little O
loudly O
about O
the O
waitresses O
at O
the O
slightest O
mistake, O
a O
little O
too O
strict O
to O
my O
taste O
(I’t O
want O
to O
be O
in O
their O
place). O

I’ll O
be O
happy O
to O
come O
back O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
:) O

I O
went O
there O
with O
someone O
who O
used O
to O
tell O
me O
good O
about O
it O
and O
that O
it O
was O
not O
our O
disappointment: O

- O
service B-TARGET
too O
long O
knowing O
that O
we O
arrived O
among O
the O
first O
(19:45) O
that O
we O
were O
placed O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
terrace O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
and O
that O
we O
were O
distributed O
at O
22:15 O
while O
people O
who O
arrived O
after O
us O
were O
distributed O
long O
before... O

- O
a O
little O
cautious O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
dropped O
the O
blankets O
on O
my O
partner O
by O
tasting O
her O
without O
excuses, O
for O
a O
table O
of O
4 O
he O
brought O
us O
the O
water O
carapes O
one O
by O
one O
(contenance O
75 O
cl) O
while O
we O
had O
suggested O
to O
wear O
2 O
each O
time O
so O
that O
it O
arranges O
everyone O
but O
did O
not O
hear O
what O
makes O
us O
wait O
times O
more O
than O
a O
1/4h O
to O
dissolve O
with O
water O
at O
room O
temperature O
(30°) O
- O
The O
ice O
were O
brought O
to O
us O
in O
a O
ice O
cut O
without O
a O
spoonful O
nice B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
hygiene! I-TARGET

- O
food: O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
good, O
for O
the O
persilade B-TARGET
soups I-TARGET
pass O
your O
way O
because O
there O
is O
much O
better. O

In O
fact, O
the O
supions B-TARGET
are O
served O
barely O
fried O
with O
whole O
garlic O
heads O
just O
like O
the O
jumped B-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
never O
seen O
and O
above O
all O
no O
taste! O

Additionally, O
the O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
too O
salty O
so O
need O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
(cf. O
2nd O
paragraph) O
- O
Desserts: O
lemons B-TARGET
brown I-TARGET
nothing O
to O
say O
because O
it O
is O
the O
usual O
industrial, O
tiramisu B-TARGET
is O
served O
with O
chantilly O
and O
English O
cream??? O

Never O
seen O
and O
especially O
uninterested O
for O
my O
favorite O
dessert B-TARGET
that O
is O
enough O
without O
artifici... O

Limoncello: B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
menu O
at O
30€, O
served O
at O
room O
temperature O
as O
well O
as O
water O
while O
it O
is O
served O
ice O
cream. O

In O
conclusion O
for O
everyone O
very O
disappointing O
and O
the O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
not O
at O
all O
so O
much O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
or O
dishes B-TARGET
served O
because O
when O
one O
wants O
to O
put O
his O
foot O
in O
the O
decor O
it O
should O
not O
be O
that O
the O
rest O
is O
neglected O
thing O
that O
the O
boss O
seems O
to O
have O
lost O
sight O
of O
while O
his O
father O
had O
well O
understood! O

I O
had O
booked O
4 O
days O
in O
advance O
a O
table O
for O
9 O
people O
with O
sea O
view O
for O
a O
birthday. O

As O
a O
result O
there O
was O
no O
more O
dispo O
table O
on O
the O
terrace O
with O
sea O
view, O
installed O
inside, O
table O
not O
installed O
either! O

Wok B-TARGET
Thai I-TARGET
mediocre, O
2 O
salads B-TARGET
goat/salmon, I-TARGET
one O
correct O
but O
the O
other O
lacked O
bush O
and O
brick O
leaf!!! O

We O
demand O
fingers O
for O
seafood, O
they O
arrive O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
the O
dessert O
with O
an O
excuse O
"we O
had O
more, O
we O
went O
looking O
elsewhere" O
surprising O
when O
we O
offer O
seafood O
plates. O

To O
finish O
the O
freezer B-TARGET
(plutot O
a O
foam O
decorated O
with O
a O
few O
strawberries) O
ordered O
for O
the O
birthday O
came O
to O
us O
on O
the O
table O
like O
a O
hair O
on O
the O
soup! O

Once O
we O
cut O
off O
we O
found O
ourselves O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
cream O
in O
the O
plates!!! O

Fortunately O
I O
had O
planned O
the O
candles O
because O
no O
special O
attention O
from O
the O
servers B-TARGET
to O
know O
if O
everything O
was O
fine, O
if O
the O
gate O
was O
suitable O
for O
us, O
finally O
a O
minimum O
of O
attention O
would O
have O
been O
appreciated O
for O
an O
addition O
of O
270 O
euros!!!! O

It O
corresponds O
by O
all O
points O
to O
the O
trap B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tourists I-TARGET
by O
excellence. O

Guests O
are O
attracted O
with O
a O
panel O
of O
photos O
of O
passing O
personalities O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Attractive O
map B-TARGET
of O
local O
specialties, O
continuous O
service O
and O
exorbitant O
prices. O

We O
are O
accepted O
at O
3 O
p.m. O
for O
lunch O
at O
8 O
p.m. O
but O
the O
waiter O
is O
alone O
at O
this O
time O
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
still O
full. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
therefore O
extremely O
long O
and O
very O
disorganized. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
dishes, B-TARGET
very O
disappointing. O

We O
were O
brought O
the O
homar O
pins O
when O
getting O
rid O
of O
the O
table!!! O
the O
coffee O
arrived O
well O
before O
the O
desserts... O

In O
short, O
a O
very O
salty O
addition O
for O
a O
very O
long O
and O
unpleasant O
meal! B-TARGET

First, O
a O
server B-TARGET
literally O
jumped O
on O
us O
when O
we O
were O
reading O
the O
card, O
despite O
this O
rather O
brutal O
method O
the O
content O
of O
the O
card B-TARGET
looked O
not O
bad, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
accept, O
then O
after O
making O
our O
choice, O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
was O
long, O
fortunately O
the O
misleading O
of O
a O
waitress O
with O
her O
dishes O
made O
us O
pass O
the O
time, O
they O
made O
us O
hurt. O

Now, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
correct, O
however, O
from O
the O
installation O
of O
the O
plates, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
took O
my O
half O
of O
Leffe O
which O
was O
not O
finished O
without O
me O
realizing, O
it O
is O
a O
rather O
dubious O
practice O
to O
push O
for O
consumption, O
I O
suppose O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
take O
another O
since O
in O
addition O
he O
laid O
on O
the O
table O
neither O
water O
nor O
bread, O
I O
had O
to O
ask, O
and O
he O
replied O
to O
me O
to O
wait O
because O
he O
had O
no O
more O
bread, O
it O
meant O
that O
he O
was O
waiting O
for O
a O
table O
to O
be O
released O
to O
give O
us O
his O
basket? O

And O
finally, O
I O
go O
to O
the O
box O
to O
pay, O
and O
there O
the O
cherry O
on O
the O
cake O
he O
announces O
to O
me O
that O
they O
don’t O
take O
the O
card, O
in O
2015, O
with O
a O
similar O
geographic O
situation, O
and O
all O
these O
tourists, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
hear O
this, O
it O
smells O
scam, O
right? O

So O
I O
had O
to O
withdraw O
with O
a O
waiter O
who O
followed O
me O
in O
case O
I O
would O
have O
decided O
not O
to O
return, O
in O
addition O
we O
feel O
like O
we O
are O
thieves, O
and O
when O
I O
came O
back O
a O
gentleman B-TARGET
was O
present O
at O
the O
box O
office, O
he O
did O
not O
smile O
and O
was O
also O
very O
unpleasant. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
because O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
in O
addition O
was O
expensive O
enough O
for O
what O
we O
had, O
and O
on O
the O
note O
no O
number O
of O
SIRET, O
nor O
the O
name O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
chose O
this O
restaurant O
a O
little O
by O
chance: O
parked O
two O
steps O
away, O
we O
were O
attracted O
by O
a O
map B-TARGET
highlighting O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
home O
made. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
the O
square O
is O
pleasant O
(little O
traffic). O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
wary. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
refined: O
the O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
market O
with O
its O
3 O
surprises O
entries O
is O
delicious. O

The O
buillabaisse, B-TARGET
copywriter, O
was O
a O
delight O
(no O
more O
aristocracy!). O

The O
only O
small O
hassle: O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
of O
the O
menu O
was O
served O
to O
me O
almost O
cold, O
because O
of O
the O
time O
of O
preparation O
of O
the O
bouillabaisse. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
recommend. O

This O
is O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
I O
already O
liked. O

Private O
exit O
with O
my O
wife, O
and O
really O
not O
disappointed: O
very O
nice O
welcome, B-TARGET
good O
table, O
warning O
server B-TARGET
and O
no O
waiting B-TARGET
for O
the O
order. O

A O
delight O
on O
the O
fish B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
board: I-TARGET
hyper O
fresh, O
and O
very O
well O
prepared O
fish. B-TARGET

A O
little O
wait B-TARGET
for O
desserts, O
but O
normal O
given O
the O
affluence O
(reputation O
and O
quality O
require). O

In O
addition, O
the O
quality O
ratio O
is O
very O
good O
(€45 O
per O
person O
with O
excellent O
wine). B-TARGET

We O
will O
return O
there O
to O
enjoy O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
map...and O
for O
the O
beautiful O
sunset O
on O
the O
bay O
of O
Marseille O
and O
the O
islands. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
exposed, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
of O
great O
quality. O

The O
products B-TARGET
used O
were O
fresh O
and O
everything O
we O
ate O
was O
super O
good. O

We O
will O
definitely O
return O
to O
eat O
under O
this O
magnificent O
plateau B-TARGET
that O
represents O
the O
terrace O
of O
southern O
France. O

Special O
mention O
to O
servers B-TARGET
for O
their O
professionalism. O

They O
know O
how O
to O
comfort O
customers O
by O
giving O
them O
good O
advice O
without O
disturbing O
them. O

Never O
go O
there!! O

We O
expected O
something O
of O
very O
high O
quality, O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
ordinary O
and O
some O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
dull. O

The O
confit B-TARGET
does O
not O
look O
like O
a O
confit O
(it O
looks O
like O
a O
sausage) O
and O
the O
taste O
does O
not O
follow O
either. O

St. B-TARGET
James’ I-TARGET
croustade I-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
of O
our O
dishes O
(the O
St. B-TARGET
Jacks I-TARGET
are O
generous O
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
good). O

Not O
bad, O
but O
a O
bit O
disappointing. O

We O
had O
booked O
in O
this O
restaurant O
seeing O
that O
it O
was O
recommended O
by O
the O
Gault O
and O
Millau, O
it O
has O
a O
super O
nice O
deco B-TARGET
and O
everything O
seemed O
to O
be O
put O
together O
to O
discover O
a O
new O
good O
table O
on O
Marseille. O

Unfortunately, O
this O
was O
not O
our O
disappointment. O

No O
wine O
at O
less O
than O
35 O
€ O
per O
bottle, B-TARGET
prices O
that O
would O
be O
justified O
if O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
was O
at O
the O
height. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
was O
hard, O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
pasta O
frozen O
and O
without O
taste. O

One O
of O
the O
guests O
was O
sick O
after O
the O
meal. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
remains, O
friendly O
but O
a O
little O
too O
casual O
that O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
highlight O
the O
lack O
of O
quality O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

It’s O
hard O
to O
go O
down, O
we’ll O
say O
that. O

Unpleasant O
servers, B-TARGET
are O
you O
not O
around? O

It O
is O
a O
pity! O

Reckon O
your O
money, O
trust O
me, O
you’ve O
really O
been O
interested. O

He O
struck O
us, O
but O
we O
could O
see O
that O
tonight, O
they O
struck O
at O
least O
eight O
tables O
that O
complained. O

Well, O
well O
on O
the O
mistake O
was O
in O
their O
favour!!! O
20 O
euros O
for O
us O
on O
an O
addition O
of O
85 O
euros! O

Prsca O
20%!!! O
The O
most O
beautiful: O
without O
disassembling: O
"what O
is O
the O
beverage!!!!" O
No O
more O
to O
say O

When O
you O
go O
to O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
don’t O
go O
there O
to O
make O
an O
original O
discovery, O
just O
“classic”. O

It O
looks O
like O
what O
the O
restaurants O
buy O
at O
Metro... O

A O
coincidence? O
→ O

Staying B-TARGET
on O
the O
water O
is O
nice. O

Especially O
as O
the O
service B-TARGET
there O
is O
fast O
and O
rather O
pleasant, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
generous O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
really O
nice. O

But O
what O
is O
fat? O

These O
poor O
poulps B-TARGET
could O
have O
died O
of O
excess O
cholesterol O
if O
they O
had O
not O
ended O
up O
on O
the O
floor. O

And O
hop, O
one O
after O
noon O
to O
digest O
them. O

And O
I’m O
not O
talking O
about O
the O
island. B-TARGET

Well, O
but O
it O
could O
really O
be O
of O
good O
quality. O

Next O
Next O
post: O
Why O
Salmon? O

Is O
there O
enough O
fish O
in O
the O
Mediterranean? O

Just O
a O
little O
effort! O

We O
liked O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
from O
the O
time O
of O
the O
old O
team O
but O
then O
there O
disappointment. O

After O
an O
average O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
the O
card B-TARGET
looked O
tempting O
but O
when O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
arrived O
it O
wasn’t O
up O
to O
it. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
good O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
simple O
compared O
to O
the O
prices. O

A O
salmon B-TARGET
tartar I-TARGET
with O
too O
many O
onions. O

A O
steam O
salmon O
is O
also O
served O
with O
an O
onion O
sauce. O

A O
profitole B-TARGET
proposed O
XL O
but O
in O
the O
plate O
the O
cabbage B-TARGET
was O
too O
cooked, O
so O
disappointment, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
have O
a O
smaller O
but O
better O
profitole. O

The O
price O
is O
too O
high O
compared O
to O
what O
was O
offered. O

There O
were O
only O
three O
tables O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
a O
Friday O
night. O

But O
what O
happened? O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
two O
months, O
the O
situation B-TARGET
has O
deteriorated O
at O
a O
phenomenal O
speed. O

Total O
disorganisation O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
forced O
to O
repeatedly O
demand O
the O
aperitif O
as O
well O
as O
the O
wine, O
believing O
that O
they O
do O
not O
want O
to O
be O
consumed. O

An O
endless O
wait B-TARGET
before O
ordering. O

Normal O
when O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
do O
not O
manage O
their O
tables... O
holidays O
go O
and O
come O
without O
any O
logic O
of O
service! B-TARGET

Fortunately O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
catches O
this O
but O
what O
a O
waste O
for O
this O
little O
Italian O
rest O
with O
a O
beautiful O
terrace B-TARGET
and O
fresh O
products. O

Please O
restore O
order O
in O
your O
organization. O

The O
person O
who O
welcomes O
and O
places O
people O
would O
do O
better O
to O
manage O
the O
service B-TARGET
instead O
of O
walking O
hands O
in O
the O
pockets. O

It O
is O
not O
understood O
to O
assign O
to O
each O
server O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
rest O
and O
so O
everyone O
can O
follow O
his O
orders O

I O
have O
been O
in O
this O
restaurant O
for O
years. O

It O
is O
always O
as O
good. O

The O
formula B-TARGET
is O
perfect. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
always O
cooked O
as O
desired O
and O
if O
you O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
fries O
ask O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
to O
bring O
you O
a O
plate. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
careful. O

In O
short, O
a O
Resto B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
come O
with O
friends O
to O
eat O
well O
and O
quickly O
if O
you O
want. O

It O
was O
almost O
by O
chance O
that O
we O
ate O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
positively O
surprised. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant, O
smiling O
and O
attentive. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
simple O
and O
of O
good O
quality. O

Balanced O
portions, B-TARGET
except O
for O
the O
entrance B-TARGET
(gratinated O
molds) O
that O
was O
too O
small O
so O
the O
molds B-TARGET
were O
good. O

White B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
was O
quite O
adequate O
and O
at O
a O
price O
more O
than O
reasonable, O
14 O
euros. O

We O
recommend O
this O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
located O
in O
the O
area. O

A O
great O
surprise O
at O
the O
Port B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Marseille. I-TARGET

The O
prices O
are O
fair, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
in O
quantity O
and O
with O
a O
wide O
selection O
(one O
cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
displays O
more O
than O
30 O
specimens!) O

Of O
course, O
it’s O
not O
gastronomy, O
but O
you O
don’t O
come O
to O
a O
buffet O
at O
will O
for O
it. O

So O
we O
go O
back O
relaxed O
and O
happy O
to O
have O
had O
a O
good O
time O
for O
not O
too O
expensive O
(at O
the O
port, B-TARGET
it O
is O
quite O
remarkable). O

Of O
course O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
well O
located, O
but O
that O
does O
not O
justify O
the O
prices O
practiced O
for O
a O
just O
average O
quality. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day, O
as O
its O
name O
suggests, O
is O
rather O
a O
guarantee O
of O
freshness O
and O
quality; O
this O
day O
if O
the O
sandwich B-TARGET
was O
suitable, O
the O
accompaniment B-TARGET
is O
very O
limited O
to O
namely O
dried O
and O
cold O
pasta. B-TARGET

A O
convenient O
service, B-TARGET
but O
not O
to O
be O
renewed, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
small O
restaurants O
that O
know O
how O
to O
serve O
a O
better O
quality O
cuisine O

I O
have O
known O
the O
address O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

The B-TARGET
big I-TARGET
disappointment: I-TARGET

A O
good O
pizza, B-TARGET
but O
served O
without O
cover. O

A O
pressure B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
at O
3.7 O
euros O
without O
a O
bubble O
with O
a O
taste O
of O
water, O
in O
short O
a O
beer O
cut O
with O
water. O

The O
server’s O
answer: O
Yes, O
are O
we O
having O
troubles O
at O
the O
moment? O

(with O
a O
smile O
in O
the O
corner) O

I O
rebounded O
my O
luck O
with O
an O
open O
6 O
euro O
beer B-TARGET
bottle I-TARGET
arrived O
with O
a O
lemon O
barrel O
inside?? O

It O
has O
no O
flavor O
and O
a O
taste O
of O
water. O

The O
neighbor O
at O
the O
next O
table O
returned O
her O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
there O
were O
so O
many O
ice O
she O
no O
longer O
had O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
wine. O

As O
I O
said O
before, O
don’t O
go O
to O
the O
toilet. O

18 O
year O
old O
servers B-TARGET
very O
nice O
but O
tips O
not O
possible O
here.... O

Really O
a O
pity! O

There O
is O
absolutely O
no O
need O
to O
assert O
this!! O

Per O
by O
masochist O
spirit, O
I O
went O
back O
to O
this O
"restaurant" B-TARGET
saying O
to O
myself O
that O
maybe.... O
in O
fact O
nothing O
has O
changed, O
no O
service, B-TARGET
with O
poorly O
crafted O
staff, B-TARGET
poorly O
dressed, O
poorly O
professional.We O
wait O
20 O
minutes O
to O
get O
the O
card, O
if O
we O
don't O
take O
an O
apero. O

The O
situation B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
st O
detestable, O
it O
is O
a O
dining O
place O
for B-TARGET
tourists, I-TARGET
as O
is O
the O
place O
where O
you O
really O
"wait" O
the O
tourist. O

Glass O
wine B-TARGET
not O
fresh, O
in O
bottle B-TARGET
fairly O
expensive O
and O
a O
beer B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
bottle I-TARGET
uncomfortable O

Catering O
service, B-TARGET
the O
waitress B-TARGET
carries O
the O
"soup" O
of O
fish O
in O
her O
2 O
hands O
by O
making O
the O
dish O
hot, O
no O
literal, O
no O
class O
really O

We O
eat O
more O
than O
we O
eat O
to O
avoid O
it. O

Attracted O
by O
the O
front O
door O
declining O
as O
pretty O
chic, O
the O
price O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at O
€15 O
did O
not O
inspire O
a O
refined O
cuisine... O
but O
there O
it O
is O
worse O
than O
anything... O

Frozen O
but O
frozen O
not O
good!!! O
marinated O
chickens.... O
that O
is, O
a O
chickens B-TARGET
that O
looks O
like O
real O
rubber O
with O
vinegar... O
basically O
a O
simple O
salad! O

Marine B-TARGET
moulds I-TARGET
who O
bathed...in O
their O
water O
yes O
without O
sauce: O
no O
interests!!! O

The O
worst O
thing O
is O
service!! B-TARGET

An O
inexisting O
management: B-TARGET
15 O
to O
20 O
minutes O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
between O
each O
dish, O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
serves O
dishes O
on O
the O
next O
table O
but O
who O
only O
gets O
rid O
of O
us O
10 O
minutes O
later...and O
the O
must....when O
in O
the O
choice O
of O
dessert B-TARGET
there O
was O
only O
a O
dessert O
with O
red O
fruits O
on O
the O
4 O
options O
of O
the O
menu...my O
friend O
not O
like O
the O
latter...the O
boss B-TARGET
refused O
to O
exchange O
the O
coffee O
for O
the O
dessert O
he O
did O
not O
take..... O

A O
customer O
relationship! O

As O
for O
the O
sour O
and O
sparkling O
fruit B-TARGET
salad...I I-TARGET
suspect O
they O
put O
orange... O

I O
would O
never O
know!!! O

Don’t O
be O
fooled O
by O
the O
attractive O
price O
and O
advance, O
competitors O
practice O
the O
same O
types O
of O
menus O
and O
are O
more O
qualified O
and O
more O
pleasant O

The B-TARGET
beach O
is O
ideally O
situated. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
warm O
welcome. B-TARGET

Nevertheless, O
expensive O
meals, B-TARGET
without O
much O
choice, O
heavy O
and O
very O
fat. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
even O
after O
10 O
hours O
of O
digestion, O
the O
hot B-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET

What O
a O
cold O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
what O
an O
antipathetic O
service! B-TARGET

Brunch O
enthusiasts O
we O
went O
there O
on O
a O
Sunday O
to O
brunch O
in O
the O
sun O
on O
the O
terrace: B-TARGET
the O
brunch B-TARGET
is O
served O
at O
the O
table O
and O
not O
as O
a O
buffet, O
it O
is O
abundant O
and O
rather O
good: O
there O
are O
eggs, O
bacon, O
sausage, O
wines, O
salmon O
and O
fruit O
salad, O
white O
cheese O
among O
others, O
its O
price O
is O
correct, O
however O
we O
were O
very O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service: B-TARGET
waitress B-TARGET
speed O
and O
poorly O
friendly, O
she O
did O
not O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
dish O
of O
salt O
while O
she O
had O
brought O
us O
the O
coffee O
for O
the O
wines, O
we O
ate O
our O
wafer O
on O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
table O
to O
not O
mix O
them O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
sausage... O
very O
clean! O

We O
asked O
her O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it, O
she O
didn’t O
but O
passed O
3 O
times O
in O
front O
of O
us O
with O
empty O
hands...it’s O
very O
average. O

The O
brunch B-TARGET
was O
great, O
but O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
did O
not O
deserve O
us O
to O
come O
back. O

At O
first O
we O
already O
had O
the O
impression O
of O
bothering, O
to O
the O
limit O
not O
too O
serious O
tourist O
city O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
so O
I O
think O
the O
waiters O
tired. O

Once O
the O
meal B-TARGET
at O
the O
table, O
a O
disaster, O
not O
to O
mention O
mistakes O
or O
forgetting, O
an O
impression O
of O
damaged O
meat B-TARGET
and O
I O
pass... O

Going O
to O
the O
bathroom O
we O
noticed O
a O
facility B-TARGET
in O
a O
state O
more O
than O
laborious, O
worse O
than O
in O
our O
worst O
nightmares, O
dirty, O
shattered, O
how O
can O
one O
make O
food O
in O
such O
a O
place, O
I O
felt O
bad O
to O
see O
this. O

to O
close O
immediately. O

Please O
go O
somewhere O
else O
thank O
you. O

Under O
the O
sun O
of O
the O
Estaque, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
has O
a O
small O
side O
deco B-TARGET
very O
nice O
(table O
way O
teck, O
"sets" O
in O
ardoise). O

The O
big O
+ O
is O
the O
smiling O
welcome O
of O
the O
2 O
waitresses, B-TARGET
available O
and O
knowing O
the O
dishes O
well. O

I O
chose O
a O
fresh-fished B-TARGET
sea I-TARGET
wolf I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
his I-TARGET
ratatouille I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
purée I-TARGET
accompanied I-TARGET
by I-TARGET
an I-TARGET
olive I-TARGET
oil I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
citrus I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
herbs, I-TARGET
the O
whole O
resulting O
a O
bit O
insipid. O

I O
am O
so O
sorry O
to O
write O
that O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
pleasure O
of O
kindness. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
did O
not O
leave O
me O
a O
memorable O
memory O
(a O
gourmet O
tea). O

You O
can O
do O
better, O
I’m O
sure. O

The O
unavoidable O
one! O

A O
kitchen B-TARGET
always O
fresh O
and O
fine, O
very O
good O
products, B-TARGET
cooked O
with O
talent O
and O
love. O

A O
always O
perfect O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
a O
very O
good O
choice O
of O
wine B-TARGET
(even O
the O
pichets B-TARGET
are O
very O
good), O
aperitifs B-TARGET
and O
especially O
to O
try O
the O
cocktails!! B-TARGET

It O
was O
invented O
and O
carefully O
prepared O
by O
the O
super O
bartender!! O

Between O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
summer O
and O
the O
tables O
in O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
fireplace B-TARGET
in O
the O
winter, O
music, B-TARGET
the O
frame B-TARGET
brings O
together O
all O
the O
ingredients O
to O
spend O
a O
wonderful O
evening. O

We O
go O
with O
our O
eyes O
closed. O

Reading O
the O
various O
praiseful O
comments, O
I O
wonder O
a O
little O
if O
I O
was O
in O
the O
same O
place B-TARGET
or O
if O
I O
was O
in O
a O
bad O
mood O
that O
day... O

That O
being O
said, O
I O
did O
not O
find O
the O
staff B-TARGET
friendly, O
of O
course O
we O
finished O
lunch O
a O
little O
late O
(16h) O
but O
we O
were O
pushed O
out O
because O
the O
restaurant O
was O
closing O
(what O
if O
it O
was O
to O
reopen O
two O
hours O
later!). O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
does O
not O
leave O
a O
special O
memory, O
rather O
standard O
and O
for O
the O
price O
at O
the O
end, O
one O
can O
honestly O
expect O
much O
better! O

In O
short, O
it O
doesn’t O
match O
what O
I’ve O
been O
told O
or O
read O
about O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
taste O
and O
the O
color O
:) O

We O
were O
5 O
this O
day O
to O
want O
to O
lunch O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
this O
establishment, O
with O
its O
large O
selection O
the O
map B-TARGET
suits O
everyone. O

Once O
attables O
we O
have O
to O
wait O
15 O
minutes O
to O
order O
our O
drinks O
and O
have O
the O
cards, O
yet O
15 O
minutes O
later O
the O
server O
comes O
back O
to O
take O
our O
order O
c O
is O
the O
one O
that O
he O
tells O
us O
that O
there O
are O
no O
pizzas, O
no O
hamburgers O
or O
cannelonis... O

If O
this O
had O
been O
communicated O
to O
us O
when O
we O
settled, O
we O
would O
have O
decided O
to O
change O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
had O
to O
take O
the O
olives O
left O
by O
the O
customers O
of O
the O
table O
d O
a O
cote O
(with O
the O
nuclei O
on O
the O
table O
that O
were O
not O
collected O
during O
our O
waiting) O
I O
ask O
for O
a O
ashes O
to O
put O
our O
nuclei O
there O
the O
server B-TARGET
says O
to O
me O
"you O
ask O
for O
things O
you" O

As O
we O
were O
drinking O
our O
consumptions O
we O
decided O
to O
make O
an O
effort O
by O
ordering O
all O
a O
meat, O
not O
seeing O
the O
server B-TARGET
come O
back O
and O
after O
10 O
minutes O
we O
got O
up O
to O
go O
to O
settle O
the O
note O
in O
the O
tobacco O
office O
after O
having O
to O
wait O
because O
only O
1 O
box O
the O
boss B-TARGET
asks O
me O
in O
a O
way O
through O
kindly O
the O
table O
number. O

“You O
can’t O
pay O
without O
the O
table O
number, O
I O
need O
the O
table O
number.” O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
"montagnard" O
type O
setting, B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
true O
that O
the O
smell B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
unpleasant O
when O
entering O
the O
room. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
we O
are O
in O
a O
fondue O
restaurant, O
so O
there O
are O
no O
surprises O
on O
this O
point. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
smiling O
and O
listening O
to O
the O
customer. O

It O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
disappointment O
for O
a O
lady O
from O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
who O
was O
no O
less O
unpleasant. O

This O
is O
still O
a O
good O
thing B-TARGET
to O
try O
out. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned, O
the O
framework B-TARGET
is O
exceptional. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
the O
bottom O
left O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
3 O
meters O
from O
the O
sea; O
the O
beach O
is O
on O
the O
right O
side O
(on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
restaurant O
room) O
so O
we O
are O
not O
"disturbed" O
by O
the O
plagiarists. O

As O
for O
the O
cuisine, B-TARGET
it O
is O
delicate, O
refined O
and O
in O
generous O
portions! O

Daily O
arrivals O
of O
fish, B-TARGET
therefore O
extra O
fresh. O

For O
those O
who O
do O
not O
like O
fish, O
the O
map B-TARGET
is O
varied; O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
very O
tasty!!! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
casual, O
the O
server B-TARGET
makes O
you O
comfortable O
right O
away. O

Not O
everything O
is O
given, O
but O
a O
dish O
and O
dessert O
are O
affordable. O

High O
quality O
meals B-TARGET
in O
very O
good O
shape. O

Fresh O
products B-TARGET
with O
good O
positions O
from O
the O
team B-TARGET
that O
is O
at O
the O
small O
care. O

The O
small O
plus O
a O
map B-TARGET
has O
very O
attractive O
pickups. O

An O
excellent O
little O
resto B-TARGET
with O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
homemade O
dishes, B-TARGET
which O
makes O
a O
reduced O
card B-TARGET
but O
with O
dishes O
with O
an O
exquisite O
taste. O

I O
can O
only O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
excellent O
reception B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
cuisine. B-TARGET

A O
barbecue B-TARGET
like O
I O
love O
it. O

You O
are O
received O
as O
you O
should. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
simple O
but O
of O
very O
good O
quality. O

Very O
nice O
service B-TARGET
on O
a O
beautiful O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
tourist O
is O
welcome O
and O
here O
there O
is O
no O
scam. O

Prices O
are O
reasonable O
and O
are O
not O
forced O
to O
consume. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
when O
travelling O
to O
Marseille. O

Nearby O
parking O
will O
make O
your O
stay O
cooler. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
define O
the O
framework, B-TARGET
I O
would O
say O
bluffing. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
sublime, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
quiet. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
fine, O
perfectly O
suited O
in O
quantity. O

The O
hic: O
the O
service, B-TARGET
which O
should O
be O
slightly O
better O
for O
a O
restaurant O
of O
this O
level O
( O
aperitifs O
arrived O
at O
15 O
minutes O
interval, O
two O
waiters O
wanted O
to O
settle O
us...), O
there O
is O
a O
little O
attention. O

However, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
remains O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
expectation B-TARGET
is O
not O
excessive O
(except O
for O
the O
aperitif, O
therefore). O

We O
were O
used O
to O
this O
guinguette O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
was O
at O
the O
time O
very O
nice O
with O
a O
magnificent O
view B-TARGET
of O
the O
old O
harbour O
and O
with O
unpretentious O
food B-TARGET
with O
good O
simple O
and O
fresh O
products. B-TARGET

But O
what O
happened, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
become O
a O
catch O
of O
very O
expensive O
tourists O
without O
any O
quality!!! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
deplorable O
and O
the O
whole O
restaurant O
is O
taken O
for O
a O
3* O
while O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
very O
bad!! O

We O
are O
very O
sad O
and O
very O
disappointed.. O
we O
were O
with O
some O
Marseilleans O
who O
also O
found O
this O
very O
bad, O
one O
of O
our O
friends O
was O
even O
sick O
all O
night O
after O
dinner.. O

We O
will O
not O
return O
there O
anymore. O

That O
is O
really O
a O
waste!! O

The O
restaurant O
is O
visited O
once O
a O
week O
with O
reservation. O

Typical O
Moroccan O
cuisine, B-TARGET
simple O
map B-TARGET
with O
all O
the O
dishes O
of O
the O
country. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
ready O
to O
do O
anything O
for O
everyone O
to O
eat. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
(very O
abundant, O
and O
served O
if O
needed) O
with O
a O
tea O
with O
mint O
to O
digest: O
12€ O

Do O
not O
miss O
out O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
flavors O
without O
breaking O
your O
wallet! O

There O
are O
no O
false O
notes O
in O
this. O

Starting O
with O
the O
warm O
and O
very O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
(we O
accept O
at O
14 O
on O
November O
1...many O
would O
not O
have) O

A O
simple O
but O
yet O
very O
authentic O
and O
studied...an O
American O
style O
of O
the O
70s O
while O
in O
simplicity O
and O
taste. O

The O
heart O
and O
the O
meal. B-TARGET

Whether O
these O
are O
the O
entries...a B-TARGET
very O
affordable O
price O
(between O
5 O
and O
7 O
euros) O
for O
an O
exceptional O
quality/price O
ratio. O

I O
recommend O
salmon B-TARGET
tartar I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Thailand. I-TARGET

Then O
the O
dishes...no O
doubt O
the O
most O
mastered O
speciality O
is O
the O
home O
burger! B-TARGET

A O
bread B-TARGET
prepared O
by O
a O
baker O
from O
the O
corner, O
a O
fresh O
cut B-TARGET
steak, I-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
fresh B-TARGET
products, I-TARGET
homemade O
fries, B-TARGET
the O
small O
salad B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
a O
well O
raised O
vinegar. O

Don’t O
be O
afraid O
of O
the O
words...it’s O
the O
best O
burger B-TARGET
I’ve O
ever O
eaten. O

Even O
though O
this O
is O
a O
fashion O
concept... O
few O
are O
those O
who O
master O
it O
like O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

The O
dessert B-TARGET
comes O
with O
the O
cheesecake B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
Toblerone. I-TARGET

All O
in O
a O
very O
measurable O
way. O

Entrance B-TARGET

We O
ate O
lunch O
in O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
lovely O
terrace B-TARGET
and O
view I-TARGET
of O
the O
sea. O

We O
were O
welcomed O
on O
the O
terrace, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
I O
had O
ordered O
cooking O
blue O
came O
"bloody", O
not O
terrible O
for O
a O
meat O
specialist O
restaurant! B-TARGET

But O
good O
to O
not O
do O
the O
hard, O
I O
eat O
it O
anyway O
without O
bringing O
it O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
and O
wasting O
it. O

When O
the O
waiter O
asked O
us O
if O
it O
was O
okay, O
I O
told O
him O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
the O
cooking O
wasn’t O
what O
I O
asked O
for. O

And O
there, O
what O
a O
surprise O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
is, O
he O
is O
not O
understandable, O
he O
brings O
us O
the O
addition, O
we O
settle O
and O
he O
doesn’t O
even O
say O
goodbye O
to O
us!!! O
what O
professionalism!!!! O
given O
his O
behavior O
and O
his O
young O
age, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
maturity, O
manager O
there O
is O
urgency! O

With O
this O
welcome, B-TARGET
we O
will O
not O
come O
back. O

Restaurant O
for O
family O
occasion. O

Very O
welcome, B-TARGET
discreet O
and O
efficient. O

Great O
meal, B-TARGET
in O
a O
good O
timing. B-TARGET

A O
beautiful O
and O
great O
classic, B-TARGET
which O
will O
not O
disappoint, O
no O
matter O
the O
tastes, O
big O
and O
small. O

Good O
cave B-TARGET
valued O
by O
good O
advice O
in O
the O
room. O

Together O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
those O
who O
jump O
a O
few O
consecutive O
locks... O

Quality/price O
ratio O
is O
acceptable. O

Hot O
foods B-TARGET
heated O
at O
the O
microwave. O

A O
cold O
welcome. B-TARGET

And O
to O
crown O
all O
the O
cockroaches O
invited O
to O
our O
table! O

We O
were O
sick! O

This O
establishment B-TARGET
should O
be O
closed. O

Noisy O
dining O
room O
and O
no O
other O
charm O
than O
that, O
a O
little O
lame, O
photographs O
of O
the O
“people” O
who O
visited O
the O
place O
one O
day. O

And O
finally, O
what O
is O
this O
story O
of O
not O
presenting O
cards O
to O
customers O
in O
2013? O

Overwhelmed O
reputation O
for O
an O
address B-TARGET
that O
surfs O
on O
the O
fashion O
that O
carries O
the O
neighborhood. O

When O
the O
institutions O
of O
Marseille O
fall O
asleep O
on O
their O
reputation, O
they O
are O
only O
visited O
by O
tourists. O

The O
Marseillais, O
they, O
are O
rushing O
to O
the O
new O
addresses O
opened O
by O
newcomers O
in O
the O
city... O

The O
framework B-TARGET
is O
exceptional, O
nothing O
but O
that, O
it O
is O
worth O
it. O

On O
the O
boullabaisse B-TARGET
side, O
you O
are O
presented O
with O
a O
huge O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
before O
cooking. O

But O
they O
had O
to O
shrink O
at O
cooking, O
2 O
pieces O
full O
of O
edges, O
huge O
onions, O
a O
little O
juice... O

They O
are O
hungry, O
they O
are O
hungry, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
Rab. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
wine B-TARGET
bottles I-TARGET
do O
not O
wait O
to O
be O
replaced, O
and O
there, O
the O
addition O
is O
more O
than O
salty. O

Unfortunately, O
tourists O
are O
making O
their O
wallets O
lighter. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
if O
you O
like O
dark O
light, O
are O
students O
or O
bobo/hipster. O

Come O
early O
because O
it O
fills O
up O
quickly. O

Tapas B-TARGET
are O
affordable, O
except O
for O
the O
manchego B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
(five O
thin O
slices O
for O
5€) O
and O
the O
serrano B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
(6 O
slices O
for O
10€). O

The O
matronna B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
it O
adds O
conviviality O
to O
the O
whole. O

It’s O
not O
the O
best O
food B-TARGET
I’ve O
ever O
eaten, O
but O
I O
can’t O
complain O
about O
the O
price. O

The O
dishes O
arrive O
quickly. O

Don’t B-TARGET
go I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
large I-TARGET
groups, I-TARGET
six O
people O
are O
too O
many. O

Pizza B-TARGET
is O
so O
fine O
that O
it’s O
inexhaustible: O
it O
has O
to O
be O
broken. O

Fresh O
goat B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
gourmet B-TARGET
cafes I-TARGET
at O
9 O
€, O
dusty O
frame, B-TARGET
unprofessional O
service. B-TARGET

The O
price O
goes O
up O
to O
$40 O
for O
bad B-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

In O
short, O
the O
environment O
of O
the O
site B-TARGET
absolutely O
does O
not O
justify O
the O
move O
to O
this O
"restaurant" B-TARGET
of O
which O
one O
wonderes O
if O
the O
tenants O
have O
learned O
to O
cook O
and O
know O
what O
a O
trade O
is. O

Small O
market O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
aperitif B-TARGET
planches I-TARGET
are O
good. O

The O
beef B-TARGET
is O
of O
a O
fantastic O
quality, O
the O
many O
wines B-TARGET
are O
available O
in O
the O
glass, O
the O
tartar B-TARGET
is O
not O
terrible O
because O
there O
is O
too O
much O
mustard O
in O
the O
mixture... O
besides O
mustard O
in O
tartar... O
bizarre. O

There O
is O
no O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
on O
the O
part B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
God. I-TARGET

Well, O
but O
there O
is O
better. O

That O
the O
leader O
tries O
to O
revive O
the O
classics B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Lyon, I-TARGET
why O
not O
if O
he O
did O
so O
with O
talent. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
mentioned O
menu B-TARGET
with O
typically O
Lyonese O
accents O
is O
not O
only O
bad O
but O
at O
the O
limit O
of O
the O
grotesque. O

Beyond O
that, O
(1) O
the O
room B-TARGET
would O
provide O
a O
refreshment, O
(2) O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
should O
learn O
to O
smile O
and O
(3) O
the O
rates O
are O
delusional O
given O
the O
poor O
kitchen B-TARGET
we O
were O
served. O

At O
the O
highest, O
one O
should O
have O
paid O
25 O
euros O
per O
person O
for O
such O
a O
mediocre O
meal, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
at O
prices O
of O
this O
order O
there O
is O
much O
better O
in O
Lyon O
and O
that O
at O
the O
prohibitive O
prices O
it O
practices, O
there O
is O
also O
much O
better O
in O
Lyon O
and O
especially O
in O
the O
surrounding O
area, O
including O
stars O
worthy O
of O
this O
name! O

We O
went O
to O
this O
small O
restaurant O
in O
Lyon. O

A O
real O
disappointment! O

We O
ate O
poor, O
unflavored O
foods B-TARGET
and, O
most O
importantly, O
we O
went O
out O
hungry! O

It O
is O
a O
pity! O

290€ O
for O
4 O
people, O
with O
a O
homemade O
aperitif, O
a O
coca, O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine... O

The O
note O
is O
salty O
and O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
what O
is O
on O
the O
plate! B-TARGET

Good O
for O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
has O
long O
been O
on O
the O
square O
in O
Saint O
Etienne. O

We O
wanted O
to O
do O
it O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
we O
will O
not O
go O
back O
and O
we O
do O
not O
recommend O
it. O

We O
were O
six O
in O
total, O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

Grands O
Gourmand O
menu, O
2 O
dishes, O
4 O
€ O
extra O
for O
cheese... B-TARGET

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
anyway. O

It O
was O
delicious, O
but O
we O
expected O
a O
better O
taste. O

Quality/price O
ratio O
is O
acceptable. O

Very O
nice O
service, B-TARGET
but O
a O
bit O
of O
speed. O

Whether O
on O
the O
counter O
or O
on O
the O
drive, O
the O
wait B-TARGET
is O
long. O

Hot O
products B-TARGET
are O
supplied O
cold O
(fries,...) O
and O
there O
is O
always O
a O
lack O
of O
items O
from O
the O
order O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
recurrent O
forgetting O
of O
sauces, O
pails O
and O
towels. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
for O
this O
great O
teaching. O

Super O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
very O
well O
informed O
on O
the O
South O
American O
specialties!!! O

Great O
cocktail B-TARGET
to O
eat O
as O
soon O
as O
possible!!! O

I’ve O
been O
in O
this O
restaurant O
for O
many O
years, O
and O
I’ve O
been O
bringing O
customers O
there. O

For O
ten O
years O
I O
had O
not O
returned O
there O
and O
came O
back O
this O
year O
and O
not O
too O
disappointed O
though... O
as O
I O
expected O
to O
find O
a O
temple O
of O
gastronomy, O
the O
bar O
was O
a O
bit O
high. O

That O
said, O
the O
quality O
is O
always O
at O
your O
disposal, O
the O
prices O
as O
well... O
but O
the O
quality O
has O
a O
price O
and O
when O
it O
is O
very O
good O
and O
tasty O
it O
is O
never O
too O
expensive. O

A O
little O
isolated O
on O
this O
boulevard O
J O
Janin O
but O
parking O
is O
still O
possible O
without O
going O
too O
far. O

So O
to O
advise O

I've O
been O
eating O
down O
for O
years O
and O
I've O
brought O
back O
a O
lot O
of O
customers O
there... O

I O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
which O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
mulhouse O
kebab. O

A O
delicious O
white B-TARGET
sauce!! I-TARGET

Very O
smiling O
and O
pleasant O
staff. B-TARGET

We O
had O
dinner O
on O
a O
Sunday O
evening, O
good O
fresh O
meal B-TARGET
nothing O
exceptional O
but O
pleasant! O

Very O
friendly O
service! B-TARGET

A O
very O
good O
Thai. B-TARGET

A O
very O
warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
a O
very O
long O
wait B-TARGET
for O
a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
is O
really O
not O
worth O
its O
price! O

I O
would O
not O
go O
back O

Disastrous O
home,of B-TARGET
3 O
servers, B-TARGET
only O
1 O
of O
them O
said O
hello, O
the O
servers O
are O
on O
their O
phone O
behind O
the O
bar, O
laughing O
with O
each O
other, O
being O
obviously O
noisy. O

The O
worst O
is O
the O
toilet. O

A O
disaster, O
all O
the O
toilets O
being O
full O
of O
feces, O
more O
toilet O
paper, O
toilets O
at O
the O
level O
of O
staff.... B-TARGET

To O
avoid O
absolutely, O
take O
your O
legs O
to O
your O
neck. O

A B-TARGET
nice I-TARGET
place, I-TARGET
a O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
a O
nice O
card! B-TARGET

All O
citizens B-TARGET
are O
attractive. O

Some O
problems O
with O
stock O
management, O
several O
dishes B-TARGET
not O
available... O

It O
is O
a O
shame O
for O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

several O
meals B-TARGET
at O
noon, O
often O
dish O
of O
the O
day, O
very O
good O
quality O

ratio O
for O
fish O
restaurant B-TARGET

A O
chain B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
we O
pushed O
the O
door O
because O
in O
general, O
without O
being O
extraordinary O
it O
is O
a O
value O
on, O
not O
too O
expensive O
and O
fast. O

Not O
here, O
approximate O
cleanliness, O
complicated O
at O
the O
level O
of O
service, B-TARGET
when O
to O
the O
pizza, B-TARGET
zero. O

Is O
there O
no O
good O
luck O
or O
lack O
of O
quality? O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back... O

A O
wonderful O
welcome. B-TARGET

The O
seats O
are O
very O
comfortable O
and O
the O
frame B-TARGET
is O
clean. O

A O
menu B-TARGET
at O
$25 O
can O
allow O
you O
to O
eat O
well O
without O
ruining O
yourself O
too O
much O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
on O
the O
card O
are O
also O
very O
abundant. O

Take O
the O
truffle, B-TARGET
a O
truffle! O

I O
recommend O
with O
closed O
eyes. O

I O
have O
eaten O
for O
the O
second O
time O
today. O

Friday O
is O
a O
burger. O

This O
is O
simply O
the O
best O
I O
have O
eaten! O

Good, O
organic, O
perfect O
cooking, O
warm, O
scented O
and O
slightly O
spicy! O

Today, O
a O
sweet O
beef O
cooked O
with O
vegetables. O

It O
is O
100% O
in O
line O
with O
my O
expectations O
and O
expectations. O

Freshness, O
taste, O
balance, O
very O
good O
quality O
price O
ratio. O

It O
was O
served O
by O
a O
very O
friendly O
waitress. B-TARGET

What O
more O
to O
ask! O

Located O
in O
a O
small O
street O
in O
the O
old O
center O
of O
Gap, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
well-decorated. O

You O
could O
almost O
think O
of O
Britain. O

The O
small O
card B-TARGET
is O
appetizing... O
unfortunately O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
by O
the O
Galettes, B-TARGET
not O
very O
large, O
not O
very O
tasty, O
not O
very O
loaded... O

I O
am O
a O
gourmand. O

Cider B-TARGET
is O
good. O

And O
the O
cakes B-TARGET
are O
excellent O
(the O
pasta B-TARGET
and O
the O
accompanying). B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
pro. O

There O
is O
not O
much O
left O
in O
this O
area B-TARGET
so O
I O
would O
like O
to O
go O
back. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
pizza O
in O
Gap O
and O
even O
see O
from O
France.... O
ask O
the O
"like O
DAB" O
of O
Chris... O

A O
mixture O
of O
everything O
with O
fresh O
cream O
on O
it, O
all O
on O
a O
delicious O
and O
perfectly O
cooked O
paste... B-TARGET

It O
really O
is O
worth O
the O
tour... O

If O
you O
don’t O
have O
time, O
ask O
to O
win O
it. O

We O
went O
out O
for O
a O
Friday O
evening O
dinner O
with O
friends. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
nice. O

You O
can’t O
talk O
without O
screaming O
because O
of O
the O
noise. O

The O
music B-TARGET
was O
really O
strong. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
gives O
us O
the O
supplement O
without O
us O
asking O
for O
it. O

And O
we O
say O
text: O
if O
you O
want O
coffee O
or O
digestive O
it O
is O
in O
5 O
min O
Max O
at O
the O
bar!!!!!!!! O

I O
booked O
a O
table O
at O
9 O
a.m. O
not O
from O
9 O
a.m. O
to O
22 O
pm!!! O

I O
would O
not O
go O
back. O

It O
is O
known O
as O
a O
mountain O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Very O
abundant O
dishes, B-TARGET
terroir O
products B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
impeccable O
service B-TARGET
immersed O
in O
a O
very O
good O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Another O
good O
thing O
is O
a O
reasonable O
cost. O

Go O
there O
with O
confidence O
if O
you O
want O
a O
simple, O
honest O
and O
generous O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Beautiful O
setting B-TARGET
and O
formula B-TARGET
for O
two O
well O
served O
with O
good O
products! B-TARGET

A O
beautiful O
mountain O
map B-TARGET
too, O
and O
excellent O
ice B-TARGET
cream O
to O
enjoy O
in O
the O
summer O
in O
the O
small O
garden B-TARGET
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
came O
here O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
with O
a O
great O
memory O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
back O
there. O

Arriving O
at O
8 O
there O
was O
only O
a O
table O
of O
2 O
busy O
believing O
that O
people O
were O
getting O
better O
informed. O

We O
all O
took O
the O
menu O
at O
29, O
being O
good O
eaters O
he O
looked O
very O
attractive. O

Result O
of O
the O
sachet O
salad B-TARGET
with O
a O
ridiculous O
cheese B-TARGET
toast I-TARGET
on O
a O
large O
slice O
of O
meat O
bread O
and O
disastrous O
dishes... B-TARGET

No O
accompaniment O
noted O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
was O
served O
we O
had O
frozen O
fries B-TARGET
thrown O
onto O
our O
meats B-TARGET
to O
camouflage O
misery O
and O
grilled O
beans B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
had O
fish. O

The O
disaster O
of O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
continues. O

In O
short, O
we O
noticed O
this O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
told O
us O
to O
agree O
that O
we O
would O
have O
changed O
the O
menu O
in O
the O
morning O
in O
the O
kitchen O
but O
not O
on O
paper. O

The O
price O
is O
29 O
euros O
for O
frozen O
and O
sachet. B-TARGET

We O
went O
there O
twice O
in O
fifteen O
days O
and O
before O
varied O
the O
chosen O
dishes. O

As O
a O
result, O
everything O
is O
very O
good, O
with O
special O
mention O
of O
the O
ravioles B-TARGET
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
the O
plate O
pintade. B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
below. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
warm. O

We O
will O
go O
back! O

To O
avoid... O

This O
is O
a O
good O
entrance, O
and O
a O
disappointment O
for O
the O
Tatar. B-TARGET

For O
me, O
it O
was O
raw O
meat O
covered O
with O
ketchup. O

I O
am O
not O
talking O
about O
accompanying. B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
my O
opinion O
was O
not O
heard O
during O
the O
dinner. O

No O
proposed O
change O
or O
commercial O
gesture. O

My O
husband O
and O
I, O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
Asian O
restaurants, O
were O
very O
disappointed. O

The O
nuts B-TARGET
are O
right, O
the O
amounts B-TARGET
are O
small O
(we’re O
out O
having O
barely O
eaten O
enough), O
the O
crushing B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
isn’t O
and O
baths O
in O
the O
fat. O

The O
prices O
are O
quite O
high O
for O
what O
we O
ate. O

Let’s O
not O
talk O
about O
the O
waitress’ B-TARGET
forced O
smile, O
but O
we O
were O
warned O
on O
this O
point. O

We O
will O
not O
go O
back! O

Sympathetic O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
good O
pizzas B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
salads B-TARGET
terrace B-TARGET
and O
only O
incovenient O
a O
staircase O
to O
climb O
if O
no O
room O
below O

At O
a O
distance O
of O
200 O
meters O
from O
my O
house, O
when O
I O
want O
a O
pizza, O
I O
go O
down O
there. O

The O
smell O
is O
already O
appealing O
when O
you O
walk O
ahead. O

The O
boss B-TARGET
was O
really O
nice O
and O
I O
even O
got O
a O
free O
pizza O
without O
asking O
for O
anything. O

Bresson B-TARGET
is O
my O
favorite. O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
well O
garnered. O

Keep O
going, O
that O
is O
happiness. O

The O
price O
is O
a O
bit O
high O
on O
the O
card B-TARGET
except O
for O
the O
formula B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day. O

Good O
food, B-TARGET
a O
little O
bit O
for O
the O
service. B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
you O
have O
the O
embarrassment O
of O
choosing. O

Always O
empty, O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
a O
decorative O
street O
window... O

We O
were O
welcomed O
by O
the O
owner B-TARGET
with O
a O
big O
smile. O

The O
deco B-TARGET
is O
low O
range O
and O
clinking. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good, O
typical, O
the O
map B-TARGET
offers O
a O
lot O
of O
choices. O

Therefore, O
one O
asks O
how O
to O
serve O
fresh O
products O
with O
so O
little O
attendance O
and O
such O
a O
card. O

I O
ask O
myself. O

An O
oasis O
of O
calm, O
where O
you O
have O
to O
whisper O
to O
talk O
because O
it O
resounds: O
everything O
is O
empty! O

Prices O
are O
correct. O

A O
nice O
and O
well-located O
outdoors O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
made O
us O
want O
to O
eat O
there. O

At O
the O
entrance, O
the O
reception B-TARGET
was O
quite O
cold. O

Arrives O
the O
dishes, O
for O
my O
part O
a O
net B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Vietnamese I-TARGET
pineapple O
(just O
covered O
with O
an O
industrial O
hot O

and O
accompanied O
by O

vegetables I-TARGET
(at O

which O
is O

to O
6€. O

A O
total O

The O

a O

consisting O
of O
a O
poor O

my O
dog. O

And O
to O
conclude, O
the O
boss’s B-TARGET
only O
answer O
“maybe O
you O
have O
the O
taste O
of O
someone O
who O
feeds O
fast O
food.” O

It O
is O
scandalous!! O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
city, O
La O
Bourdonnais O
street, O
it O
is O
not O
obvious O
to O
park O
at O
noon O
in O
the O
week. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
sober, O
the O
intimate O
decor B-TARGET
pleases. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
large, O
with O
a O
floor O
and O
a O
steep O
staircase. O

If O
booking O
specify O
to O
the O
DRC O
or O
floor O
to O
avoid O
surprises. O

We O
waited O
a O
while O
for O
our O
order O
to O
be O
accepted. O

At O
noon, O
the O
card B-TARGET
is O
simple, O
we O
have O
the O
choice O
between O
3 O
entrances, O
3 O
main O
dishes O
and O
3 O
deserts, O
except O
that O
when O
choosing O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
choice O
but O
only O
one O
type O
of O
dessert. O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
limited. O

Apparently O
the O
map O
needs O
to O
change O
from O
time O
to O
time. O

At O
the O
entrance O
I O
chose O
a O
chouchou O
gratin O
with O
a O
small O
salad B-TARGET
too O
seasoned. O

The O
fish, B-TARGET
a O
little O
hard, O
without O
too O
much O
flavor, O
and O
just O
the O
amount O
with O
a O
good O
presentation O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
fast. O

Fruit B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
dessert. O

So O
it’s O
a O
banal O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
doesn’t O
leave O
me O
an O
indelible O
memory. O

Very O
good O
pizzas! B-TARGET

Good O
garments, O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
they O
are O
not O
scary. O

Three O
very O
soon O
:) O

At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
apéro O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
well O
located O
in O
the O
cathedral O
square. O

Great O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

When O
it’s O
time O
for O
lunch, O
it’s O
better O
to O
change O
the O
address. O

Expensive O
card B-TARGET
for O
quality, O
slow O
service, B-TARGET
hot O
dishes. B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
pity O
for O
the O
ideas O
of O
creation. O

Reject O
the O
blue O
cards O
on O
a O
weekend O
without O
notice. O

Scandalously O

Very O
nice O
and O
very O
good O
grills. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
staff. B-TARGET

A O
good O
reference O
to O
Kourou. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
there O
is O
no O
terrace. O

This O
was O
my O
first O
lunch O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
price O
is O
correct, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
good, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
nice O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
very O
average. O

I O
didn’t O
taste O
the O
pizza O
😉 O

A O
mediocre O
food. B-TARGET

The O
high O
price O
for O
the O
service O
and O
especially O
the O
clarity O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
in O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
ate O
lunch O
surrounded O
by O
flies O
in O
an O
air-conditioned O
room. O

When O
we O
made O
the O
comment O
to O
the O
server, B-TARGET
in O
response O
we O
were O
entitled O
to O
a O
cynical O
comment. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
needs O
to O
be O
rebuilt O
quickly. O

A O
pleasant O
welcome, B-TARGET
a O
pleasant O
setting. B-TARGET

We O
regularly O
eat O
in O
groups. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
very O
fresh, O
the O
abundant O
portions, B-TARGET
accompanying B-TARGET
sauces I-TARGET
and O
vegetables B-TARGET
are O
original O
and O
very O
good. O

A O
very O
good O
address. B-TARGET

On O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
Royal O
Island, O
the O
main O
island O
of O
Salvation O
Islands O
off O
Kourou, O
we O
took O
advantage O
of O
it O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
only O
restaurant O
on O
site. O

Although O
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
courteous, O
the O
services O
suffer O
from O
the O
monopoly. O

Drinks B-TARGET
without O
taste, O
limited O
choices, O
we O
move O
to O
find O
a O
waiter, O
we O
wait O
for O
him O
to O
take O
care O
of O
you... O
ex: O
a O
customer O
is O
going O
to O
ask O
if O
we O
could O
do O
something O
for O
the O
insect O
in O
his O
dish, O
and O
well O
no, O
he O
has O
heard O
to O
say, O
it O
is O
not O
our O
fault, O
we O
can O
do O
nothing... O
exceptional O
service, B-TARGET
if O
we O
judge O
by O
this O
fact O
different! O

However, O
little O
would O
be O
enough O
to O
make O
this O
place B-TARGET
an O
exceptional O
place O
because O
the O
site B-TARGET
is O
magical O
and O
loaded O
with O
history. O

We O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
on O
a O
Sunday O
evening. O

We O
bought O
the O
menu O
for O
$29.90. O

Entrance: O
St. B-TARGET
James I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
medium O
quality O
brochures. O

We O
don’t O
change O
the O
covers. O

Dish: O
a O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
grilled I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
(not O
very O
tender), O
without O
sauce, O
with O
carrots B-TARGET
purée I-TARGET
(very O
good), O
broccoli O
and O
uncooked O
potatoes B-TARGET
in O
the O
middle. O

We O
spoke O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
gave O
it O
to O
the O
cook. O

We O
heard O
the O
latter O
say O
from O
the O
kitchen O
that O
if O
we O
were O
not O
happy O
we O
only O
had O
to O
eat O
them O
in O
purée! O

Dessert: O
Foam B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
2 I-TARGET
chocolates, I-TARGET
good O
but O
much O
too O
sweet. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
fine O
but O
the O
toilets O
are O
not O
high. O

The O
hotel O
also O
has O
a O
beautiful O
terrace. B-TARGET

In O
summary, O
a O
poorly O
crafted O
chef, B-TARGET
a O
meal B-TARGET
organic O
but O
not O
gastronomic O
(you O
can O
eat O
organic O
without O
necessarily O
being O
on O
the O
diet...), O
all O
for O
a O
too O
high O
price. O

Well O
done, B-TARGET
but O
apart O
from O
that??? O

A O
card B-TARGET
that O
starts O
at O
12th O
without O
salad, O
a O
fake B-TARGET
net I-TARGET
served O
25eu O
only O
with O
fries, O
and O
not O
a O
limousine O
meat!! O

Good O
surprise, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
kindness O
and O
a O
smile. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
well O
heated. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
traditional. O

The O

We O
come O
to O
this O
restaurant O
quite O
regularly, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
original O
and O
well O
presented O
but O
the O
hostess O
being O
alone O
serving O
it O
often O
happens O
that O
the O
dishes O
are O
warm O
which O
is O
a O
pity. O

It O
is O
a O
beautiful O
Moroccan. O

Welcome B-TARGET
and O
beautiful O
tables. B-TARGET

An O

The O

A O
correct O
addition O
of O
€113 O
for O
4 O

and O
custom O
couscous. O

Good O
location B-TARGET
in O
Lannion O

A O
small O
family O
meal. O

We O
visited O
it O
a O
few O
years O
ago, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
very O
good O
memory O
that O
has O
been O
confirmed O
once O
again! O

A O
pleasant O
room. B-TARGET

Rapid O
and O
courteous O
service. B-TARGET

After B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
long O
day, O
I O
chose O
to O
go O
home. O

I O
take O
the O
formula O
"entry O
-plate O
of O
the O
day O
for O
12€50." O

The O
entrance B-TARGET
is O
not O
good, O
no O
more O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day. O

It O
is O
replaced O
by O
another O
with O
my O
consent. O

The O
sauce O
invaded O
the O
fish. B-TARGET

There O
is O
no O
taste. O

The O
addition O
was O
no O
longer O
the O
same. O

I O
said O
nothing. O

I O
won’t O
go O
back O
because O
it’s O
not O
good. O

8€50 O
for O
a O
Greek B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
without O
flavor: O
2 O
olives, O
a O
piece O
of O
tomato O
drowned O
in O
a O
salad O
that O
baths O
in O
the O
oil. O

It O
is O
daring. O

I O
strongly O
do O
not O
recommend O
it. O

Digestive O
problems O
after O
meals. B-TARGET

I O
have O
repeated O
the O
experience O
several O
times O
but O
it’s O
over, O
I O
won’t O
go O
again!!!!! O

So, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
rest B-TARGET
class, O
a O
very O
careful O
and O
refined O
kitchen B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday, O
or O
a O
great O
occasion, O
this O
is O
the O
IDEAL O
place! B-TARGET

Menus B-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices O
and O
very O
good O
cellar B-TARGET
with O
good O
advice. O

thanks O

The O
friends O
wanted O
to O
eat O
crêpes O
but... O
impossible O
to O
get O
accepted O
in O
those O
that O
had O
been O
recommended O
to O
us: O
we O
found O
ourselves O
with O
the O
chefs O
who O
are O
not O
specialists O
in O
cookies O
and O
crêpes. O

Lovers O
of O
beer, O
steak O
fries O
and O
generous O
portions B-TARGET
you O
will O
be O
all O
the O
more O
delighted O
as O
the O
addition O
is O
light. O

When O
we O
returned O
to O
the O
establishment, B-TARGET
we O
felt O
a O
stress O
that O
floated O
around O
the O
employees. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
it O
is O
not O
surprising: O
the O
boss B-TARGET
is O
as O
kind O
as O
a O
prison O
door. O

He O
drives O
his O
employees O
to O
the O
fingers. O

As O
for O
the O
cooking, B-TARGET
it O
was O
good O
but O
no O
more: O
pieces O
of O
fat O
in O
the O
chili, B-TARGET
poorly O
cooked O
meat, B-TARGET
no O
almonds O
on O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
while O
he O
must O
have O
had O
it... O

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
well O
garnered O
and O
attractive. O

Oh O
yes! O

The O
restaurant O
was O
very O
noisy O
and O
we O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
getting O
together. O

The O
restaurant O
room B-TARGET
is O
canteen, O
the O
deco B-TARGET
is O
sad, O
as O
to O
the O
meal O
our O
entrecote B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
tender, O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
I O
would O
avoid O
