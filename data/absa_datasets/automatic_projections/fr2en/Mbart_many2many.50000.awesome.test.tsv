After O
the O
factory O
palace O
we O
come O
to O
the O
stop O
which O
is O
a O
correct O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
owner B-TARGET
welcomes O
us O
very O
warmly O
and O
his O
wife O
cooks. O

Everything O
is O
not O
done O
at O
home, O
but O
it O
is O
good. O

The O
price O
is O
a O
bit O
high O
for O
a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
didn't O
require O
all O
involvement O
from O
beginning O
to O
end. O

Local O
pizzas B-TARGET
that O
you O
will O
not O
eat O
elsewhere, O
accommodating O
the O
specialties O
of O
the O
area. O

Even O
the O
restaurant O
owner O
of O
a O
rating O
eats O
one O
on O
occasion. O

Very O
good O
reception B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
wait B-TARGET
is O
endless O
for O
a O
salad O
whose O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
industrial, O
and O
raviolis B-TARGET
in O
an O
uncooked O
cream B-TARGET
bath. O

Berk. O

In O
the O
centre O
of O
this O
very O
small O
village, O
it O
was O
not O
expected O
to O
eat O
as O
well O
on O
a O
nice O
terrace. B-TARGET

Good O
service. B-TARGET

Fanned O
salad, B-TARGET
medium O
wine, B-TARGET
grated B-TARGET
raviolis I-TARGET
edible. O

Good O
ice. B-TARGET

Overlooked O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

If O
you O
are O
on O
vacation, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
lose O
while O
looking O
at O
the O
maids B-TARGET
and O
waiters B-TARGET
(still O
charming) O
flying O
like O
flies O
who O
don’t O
know O
what O
to O
do O
or O
for O
whom O
to O
do O
(1 O
hour O
for O
3 O
cold O
ice B-TARGET
creams, I-TARGET
and, O
the O
next O
day, O
3⁄4 O
hours O
for O
3 O
ice O
creams O
never O
arrived...!), O
long O
wait B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
a O
horrifying O
music B-TARGET
(boum O
tchic, O
boum O
tchic, O
constantly). O

One O
is O
reassured O
that O
"the O
employer B-TARGET
is O
going O
to O
investigate" O
(sic), O
in O
short, O
it O
is O
RIGHT. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
in O
a O
reasonable O
time O
even O
with O
a O
choice O
of O
food, O
then O
A O
FUIR. O

I O
quickly O
advise O
them O
on O
an O
organizational O
audit. O

Damage O
to O
the O
frame B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

A O
start O
of O
the O
evening O
that O
starts O
in O
a O
good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
like O
the O
first O
time O
a O
Virgin O
Colada O
at O
6.50e O
to O
get O
ready O
and O
a O
very O
warm O
welcome B-TARGET
from O
the O
boss B-TARGET
and O
his O
wife. B-TARGET

The O
Saumon B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
is O
extra O
but O
to O
change O
I O
test O
the O
St B-TARGET
Jacques's I-TARGET
nuts I-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
at O
22 O
euros O
with O
gratin B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
(potatoes O
and O
fresh O
potatoes) O
the O
nice O
wedding O
and O
fries. O

What O
happiness O
in O
the O
dish, B-TARGET
the O
cooking O
of O
my O
nuts B-TARGET
are O
perfect, O
slightly O
naked O
inside, O
soft O
to O
desire... O
la, O
sauce B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
light. I-TARGET

I O
am O
very O
satisfied O
with O
my O
very O
good O
dish. B-TARGET

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
put O
in O
my O
top O
five. O

Final O
score O
of O
31 O
for O
a O
cocktail, O
a O
plate O
and O
a O
coffee. O

Good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

Good O
crisp B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

We O
ate O
with O
our O
children O
who O
also O
loved O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
quite O
cold, O
but O
the O
seats B-TARGET
are O
well O
maintained. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
above O
the O
market, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
guaranteed. O

The O
aperture B-TARGET
is O
amazing: O
you O
are O
served O
a O
bottle O
of O
1 O
litre O
of O
rhum O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
liquid O
cane O
sugar. O

What O
to O
eat O
for O
the O
day... O

Being O
unconvinced, O
we O
chose O
to O
test O
the O
new O
kitchen O
of O
the O
bar'oc. O

We O
had O
an O
unusual O
culinary O
experience. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
cocktails. B-TARGET

But O
the O
ultimate O
was O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
entrances. B-TARGET

The O
liver B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
on O
the O
island. O

The O
carpaccio B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
st I-TARGET
jacques I-TARGET
wild I-TARGET
is O
divine. O

Then O
came O
the O
pluma O
de O
pata O
negra O
with O
its O
incredible O
purée B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
oil. I-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
this O
incredible O
meal. B-TARGET

To O
live O
absolutely. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
- O
at O
first O
glance O
- O
rather O
attractive, O
but O
it's O
not O
counting O
on O
the O
lack O
of O
many O
foods B-TARGET
(lambi, O
marlin O
and O
tuna O
this O
evening O
there), O
and O
the O
hallucinating O
prices O
of O
others O
(especially O
the O
"plates" B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
seafood, I-TARGET
which O
are O
in O
fact O
only O
small O
tables). O

So O
my O
choice O
was O
seafood B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
(2 O
overcooked O
mussels, B-TARGET
3 O
frozen O
saint B-TARGET
jackets, I-TARGET
and O
much O
too O
much O
garlic). O

Very O
noisy O
room B-TARGET
(there O
was O
no O
more O
agreement), O
but O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
comfortable O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

Good O
laagnes B-TARGET
and O
a O
delicious B-TARGET
coffee. I-TARGET

But O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
decontracted O
is O
nice. O

Lack O
of O
professionalism. O

The O
result O
of O
cocktails O
taken O
for O
the O
aperitif O
served O
with O
the O
dishes. O

I O
didn't O
take O
any O
pleasure O
to O
take O
my O
mojito O
with O
my O
laagnes.. O
that O
I O
still O
waited O
almost O
30mn.. O

In O
short, O
damage. O

We O
did O
not O
eat, O
we O
drank O
water O
and O
oil. O

Italian B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
cooked O
on O
one O
side O
only O
and O
full O
of O
oil. O

Interviewed B-TARGET
with O
more O
nerves O
than O
meat O
and O
I O
passed. O

a O
restaurant O
that O
will O
delight O
the O
palates O
with O
very O
well O
cooked O
products. B-TARGET

but O
a O
disaster O
side O
service: B-TARGET
we O
have O
been O
forgotten O
in O
a O
corner, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
tables O
on O
the O
right O
and O
on O
the O
left O
have O
had O
the O
right O
in O
all O
respects O
(being O
Americans O
or O
a O
large O
family O
to O
be O
interesting O
must O
be O
believed!) O

There O
was O
no O
ice O
cream O
for O
the O
white O
wine, O
no O
bread O
during O
the O
meal, O
we O
had O
to O
get O
up O
to O
ask O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
who O
didn't O
even O
look O
at O
us, O
we O
waited O
a O
lot O
between O
the O
dishes O
that O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
let O
us O
clean O
the O
empty O
tables... O
in O
short! O

a O
delicious O
evening O
spoiled O
by O
these O
delightful O
hosts O

Just O
a O
call O
to O
make O
a O
reservation O
and O
see O
if O
they O
are O
open O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
tripadvisor O
notice. O

The O
staff O
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room O
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

Personally O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
to O
eat O
an O
omelet O
as O
much O
as O
to O
eat O
at O
home. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful, O
the O
base B-TARGET
is O
divine, O
the O
wines B-TARGET
are O
amazing, O
add O
to O
that O
the O
patron's O
contagious O
enthusiasm: O
what O
more O
to O
ask? O

We O
are O
so O
good O
at O
Art B-TARGET
said I-TARGET
Vin, I-TARGET
we O
spend O
good O
moments O
there O
:) O

friendly B-TARGET
welcome O
by O
2 O
seniors O
who O
make O
you O
feel O
comfortable O

The O
price-quality O
ratio O
is O
top O
with O
a O
local O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
manual O
air-conditioning O
that O
requires O
an O
explanation O

These O
are O
2*2 O
wood O
panels O
fixed O
to O
the O
ceiling O
with O
a O
floating O
fabric O
strip O
at O
the O
base O
handled O
by O
a O
hidden O
slave O
and O
providing O
a O
real O
fresh O
air O
current. O

To O
avoid O
an O
excessive O
demand O
incompatible O
with O
their O
furnace O
size, O
the O
blow O
at O
the O
big O
margin O
is O
not O
on O
the O
card B-TARGET
also O
provide O
to O
order O
it O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
meal O

An O
originality: O
vegetables B-TARGET
are O
counted O
separately, O
perhaps O
not O
to O
increase O
the O
price O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
the O
old O
one O
that O
is O
charming O

Generally, O
I O
give O
advice O
only O
when O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied. O

If O
so, O
I O
tell O
myself O
that O
I O
fell O
on O
the O
wrong O
day O
or O
on O
the O
wrong O
plate, O
but O
there O
I O
can't O
hold O
on! O

We O
were O
attracted O
by O
the O
fairly O
correct O
prices. O

But O
what O
a O
mistake! O

We O
each O
took O
a O
25 O
euro O
menu. O

The O
seafood B-TARGET
in O
the O
entrance O
was O
delicious O
(are O
they O
fresh?). O

The O
ink B-TARGET
chips I-TARGET
were O
succulent O
and O
insipid O
(securely O
frozen), O
the O
fisherman's B-TARGET
base I-TARGET
a O
bit O
better, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
nothing O
is O
fresh, O
nor O
prepared O
on O
site, O
and O
they O
use O
poor O
quality O
products. B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
edible. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
not O
really O
up O
to O
the O
mark. O

I O
had O
only O
one O
wish: O
to O
leave! O

Small O
touch O
of O
humour: O
on O
the O
facade O
it O
is O
written O
that O
the O
products O
are O
prepared O
according O
to O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
chef. O

It O
must O
not O
go O
very O
well! O

It O
also O
says: O
"our O
priority O
is O
to O
satisfy O
you". O

What O
a O
shame! O

They O
are O
not O
ashamed!!! O

We O
took O
the O
open B-TARGET
seat I-TARGET
at O
20 O
euros O
and O
we O
were O
not O
disappointed O
Anchois, O

in O
a O

little O

street I-TARGET
of O
Saint O

The O
room O
was O
very O
clean O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful. O

error O
quickly O
corrected O
by O
the O
pattern. B-TARGET

I O
ordered O
a O
blue O
magret B-TARGET
with O
fries, O
this O
arrived O
served O
with O
potato O
gratin. O

The O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

In O
addition, O
the O
maid B-TARGET
is O
not O
even O
pleasant O
and O
cheerful O

We O
liked O
everything. O

The O
setting, B-TARGET
dinner O
by O
the O
pool. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
that O
would O
be O
well O
worth O
a O
Michelin O
star. O

Taste O
associations O
and O
impeccable O
drinks. O

This O
restaurant O
on O
the O
harbour O
to O
attract O
our O
attention O
by O
the O
sophistication O
of O
its O
menu. B-TARGET

Our O
choice O
was O
on O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day O
at O
17,50 O
€ O
(entrée O
+plat) O

Due O
to O
the O
heat O
we O
were O
kindly O
advised O
to O
have O
a O
table O
in O
the O
air-conditioned O
room. O

The O
aperture O
was O
slightly O
accelerated O
by O
a O
server B-TARGET
apparently O
pressed O
to O
finish O
his O
service O
and O
who O
came O
to O
offer O
us O
to O
taste O
the O
wine O
while O
we O
commented O
only O
to O
taste O
the O
tapenade O
toast. O

( O
promptly O
taken O
up O
by O
the O
Chairman B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
Committee O
) O

The O
follow-up O
is O
more O
happy O
with O

In O
the O
entrance O
a O
range B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
corse I-TARGET
charcuterie I-TARGET
and O
excellent O
cheese O
beans. B-TARGET

Then O
a O
dorade B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
with O
small O
vegetables: O
nicely O
presented O
and O
very O
tasty. O

Finally O
a O
good O
table B-TARGET
to O
discover! O

The O
title O
summarizes O
all O

bad O

unfair O
pricing O
of O

Old O

I O
went O
there O
several O
times O
last O
year O
it O
was O
very O
correct O
but O
a O
priori O
something O
has O
changed O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
compared O
to O
last O
year O
because O
it O
has O
become O
a O
real O
nightmare. O

Pizza B-TARGET
with O

patty B-TARGET
and O
not O
cooked, O
super O
fat O
snack B-TARGET
I O
had O
to O
eat O
1/4. O

go O
your O
way! O

They O
won't O
see O
me O
anymore... O

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
lunch O
break, O
sunny, O
with O
a O
little O
refreshing O
air O
and O
views B-TARGET
of O
the O
harbour. O

Simple O
but O
good O
cuisine, B-TARGET
Marco O
welcomes O
you O
very O
well, O
gives O
you O
good O
addresses O
if O
you O
ask. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
pleasant O
place. B-TARGET

Its O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
on O
a O
very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
with O
its O
churches. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
the O
entrance, O
the O
dish O
and O
the O
dessert. O

Just O
a O
pity O
the O
server B-TARGET
or O
the O
director B-TARGET
(I O
didn't O
understand O
) O
with O
his O
cigar O
he O
will O
recognize O
(with O
piss), O
and O
he O
talks O
too O
much!!!! O

Quite O
frankly, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
quite O
nice. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
hospitality B-TARGET
is O
"young" O
and O
professional. O

The O
map B-TARGET
offers O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
brewery O
types. O

But O
great O
disappointment... O

The O
Burger B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
is O
well O
presented, O
but O
the O
cheese B-TARGET
is O
equal O
to O
Macdonald... O
No O
flavor O
and O
interest... O

The O
roquefort B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
too O
creamy, O
no O
taste... O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
is O
actually O
a O
water-filled O
cane... O

This O
is O
not O
a O
good O
sign... O

Really O
bad O
for O
the O
neighbourhood B-TARGET
and O
the O
setting. B-TARGET

It O
is O
an O
address O
where O
we O
regularly O
dine. O

Here, O
everything O
is O
favourable. O

From O
the O
reception B-TARGET
to O
the O
desk B-TARGET
to O
the O
pace O
of O
service. B-TARGET

The O
decor B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
it O
is O
better O
to O
reserve O
a O
table O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
where O
there O
is O
the O
open O
garden B-TARGET
in O
summer. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
worthy O
of O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
entrance B-TARGET
fee O
is O
7 O
euros O
and O
copies. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
don't O
expect O
big O
surprises. O

They O
master O
the O
typical O
"bistrot" O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
meats B-TARGET
are O
excellent, O
especially O
the O
grilled O
cabbage. B-TARGET

Their O
small O
pot B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
for O
dessert O
is O
a O
must-have. O

Small O
bemol. O

My O
partner O
is O
a O
vegetarian O
and O
they O
currently O
only O
have O
gnocchis O
with O
crustacean O
cream O
to O
offer O
on O
the O
plate. B-TARGET

It O
would O
be O
advisable O
to O
mention O
another O
vegetable O
sauce O
to O
accompany O
them. O

But O
we O
will O
remain O
regular O
customers O
of O
this O
indispensable O
address B-TARGET
for O
lovers O
of O
typical O
Parisian O
breweries. O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
well O
decorated. O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

To O
get O
to O
know O
Moroccan O
cuisine O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
a O
tourist O
attraction O
that O
shames O
the O
local O
cuisine. B-TARGET

In O
addition, O
we O
took O
bottles O
that O
we O
didn't O
finish O
at O
the O
table, O
we O
didn't O
even O
have O
the O
right O
to O
bring O
them O
into O
the O
entrance O
hall O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
finish O
them. O

room I-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
despite O
its O
closeness O
we O
enjoyed O
but O
there O
was O
little O
world O
then O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
the O
pleasure O
is O
always O
there O
on O
the O
evenings O
of O
rush. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
correctly O
polished O
but O
without O
interference. O

I O
did O
not O
eat O
well O
and O
I O
advise O
you O
to O
go O
your O
way. O

What O
a O
disappointment! O

The O
wine B-TARGET
is O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
wine O
cellar, O
but O
we O
are O
not O
offered O
anything O
else! O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
on O
the O
note, O
a O
very O
expensive O
wine O
is O
counted!! O

3 O
dishes O
arrive O
finally, O
then O
a O
blue O
meat B-TARGET
requested O
brought O
well O
cooked. O

Long O
after O
the O
first O
ones O
had O
already O
finished, O
the O
second O
blue, O
cold O
meat. B-TARGET

Unpleasant O
staff, O
not O
available, O
a O
birthday O
meal O
that O
turned O
awkward. O

In O
family, O
after O
a O
long O
stroll, O
the O
pleasant O
weather O
made O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
attracted O
us. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
are O
correct. O

We've O
had O
some O
meals O
of O
the O
day. O

It O
was O
good, O
but O
not O
exceptional. O

The O
children O
loved O
the O
homemade O
half-baked B-TARGET
chocolate. I-TARGET

Provide O
a O
waiting O
time O
for O
underground O
toilets O
at O
peak O
hours; O
(o) O

If O
you O
pass O
by O
there, O
you O
can O
get O
bored O
for O
the O
setting, B-TARGET
the O
birds O
and O
ducks O
around, O
but O
without O
waiting O
for O
something O
exceptional O
from O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Lunch O
was O
served O
with O
two O
16-euro O
fomules. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
the O
room O
was O
very O
clean. O

We O
have O
taken O
a O
carafe, O
so O
I O
cannot O
judge O
the O
beverages. O

Correct O
raviolis B-TARGET
and O
tartiflette, B-TARGET
good O
dessert O
pancake. B-TARGET

Indeed, O
the O
servers B-TARGET
are O
at O
home O
and O
don't O
care O
about O
clients O
when O
they O
talk. O

After O
that O
but O
a O
certain O
ambiance B-TARGET
in O
the O
room. O

Ordinary O
meals B-TARGET
but O
which O
allow O
to O
eat O
cheaper O
and O
warm. O

Check O
12€ O
for O
the O
adult O
menu O
and O
10€ O
for O
a O
child. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
avoid O
tables O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
if O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
catch O
death. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
friendly. O

We're O
a O
little O
bit O
on O
the O
edge O
but O
it's O
the O
principle O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
small O
brewery, B-TARGET
deco B-TARGET
to O
revisit O
because O
aging O
but O
family O
and O
friendly. O

Dinner O
disappointing O
from O
every O
point O
of O
view: O
pretty O
sad O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(only O
4 O
tables O
occupied O
this O
Sunday O
evening), O
a O
bit O
cold O
service B-TARGET
(only O
one O
person O
in O
the O
room, O
often O
absent, O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
wait O
for O
his O
return O
every O
time O
we O
wanted O
to O
ask O
for O
something), O
disappointing O
dishes: B-TARGET
the O
truffle B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
appearing O
in O
the O
menu O
available O
on O
the O
restaurant's O
website O
had O
become O
a O
simple O
mushroom O
risotto O
(very O
mediocre O
to O
the O
rest), O
for O
the O
same O
price O
(18 O
euros O
in O
entrance), O
and O
the O
pork B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
was O
too O
cooked, O
dry, O
ill O
accompanied. O

Disgusting O
glass B-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

The O
pain O
I O
had O
found O
on O
the O
map B-TARGET
of O
the O
website O
was O
no O
longer O
offered. O

Addition: O
160 O
euros O
to O
2 O
with O
2 O
drinks O
each O
and O
by O
sharing O
dessert. O

They O
are O
not O
worth O
it. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it. O

An O
address O
to O
advise O
if O
you O
like O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
with O
just O
what O
you O
need O
to O
taste. O

The O
snails B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
the O
soft B-TARGET
bones I-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
and O
the O
mushrooms B-TARGET
of O
our O
neighbours O
smelled O
delicious... O

Small O
room B-TARGET
but O
much O
less O
noisy O
than O
you O
might O
think, O
old O
stones O
absorb O
noise. O

Nice O
service, B-TARGET
neither O
too O
slow O
nor O
too O
fast. O

Early O
evening O
20 O
o'clock, O
to O
exit O
at O
22 O
o'clock O
30. O

A O
really O
good O
evening. O

Well, O
it's O
a O
little O
expensive O
but O
it's O
not O
a O
daily O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Taxed O
transactions. B-TARGET

Poor O
air B-TARGET
conditioning. I-TARGET

Ridiculous O
tapas. B-TARGET

Plat B-TARGET
arrived O
cold, O
badly O
cooked O
meat, B-TARGET
cold I-TARGET
potatoes, I-TARGET
raw O
cucumbers, B-TARGET
hot O
salad, B-TARGET
plate B-TARGET
too O
salty O
as O
a O
whole, O
good O
point O
for O
wine B-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

Vin B-TARGET
âcre. O

Calva B-TARGET
apple I-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
without O
calva O
is O
worth O
a O
school O
canteen. O

In O
the O
Albania O
of O
the O
century, O
the O
seats O
are O
poorly O
supplied, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
poor O
and O
the O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
totally O
appalling. O

Frozen O
fries... B-TARGET

The O
hotel O
is O
located O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
city, O
close O
to O
the O
train O
station. O

a O
proper O
food... B-TARGET

Choose O
a O
table O
that O
lets O
you O
see O
Montmartre's O
painters O
working O

Go O
there O
with O
friends O
or O
family... O

You O
will O
regret O
the O
addition O
less! O

This O
small, O
discrete O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
worth O
a O
visit, O
firstly O
- O
and O
it O
is O
worth O
pointing O
out O
- O
for O
the O
warm O
welcome B-TARGET
the O
owner O
reserves O
to O
his O
customers O
(thank O
you O
for O
the O
kir O
;), O
but O
also O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
served. O

The O
entrances B-TARGET
are O
simple O
but O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
offers O
two O
sets O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
can O
be O
adapted O
to O
all O
budgets. O

For O
our O
part, O
we O
chose O
the O
beef O
turtle. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
was O
made O
directly O
in O
the O
kitchen O
and O
especially O
delicious. O

The O
range O
of O
desserts B-TARGET
is O
humble, O
but O
each O
one O
is O
highlighted O
by O
a O
small O
creative O
touch O
of O
the O
owner, O
which O
restores O
its O
flavour. O

Without O
hesitation O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
he O
likes O
to O
eat O
with O
a O
friend O
or O
family O
member, O
and O
which O
contrasts O
strongly O
with O
the O
"industrial" O
breweries O
that O
are O
sometimes O
found O
in O
Paris. O

Don't O
hesitate! O

Wonderful! O

A O
fine, O
creative O
and O
absolutely O
delicious O
cuisine, B-TARGET
a O
warm O
setting B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
pleasant O
service. B-TARGET

At O
the O
entrance, O
we O
took O
the O
haddock B-TARGET
flammekueche I-TARGET
way I-TARGET
(delicious) O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
frozen B-TARGET
duck I-TARGET
with O
nuts O
and O
pears O
(very O
good). O

On O
the O
plate, O
I O
completely O
cracked O
on O
the O
risotto B-TARGET
cabillaud I-TARGET
chorizo I-TARGET
emulsion I-TARGET
(very O
surprising). O

Finally O
the O
masterpiece: O
vanilla O
milk O
rice O
caramel B-TARGET
butter I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
salted I-TARGET
(divin). O

The O
strawberry B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
was O
also O
perfect O
for O
a O
particularly O
tasty O
dinner. B-TARGET

The O
servers B-TARGET
were O
also O
adorable. O

A O
great O
moment, O
we O
will O
surely O
return O
there, O
and O
warmly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

I O
have O
already O
eaten O
in O
more O
than O
50 O
breweries O
has O
passed O
and O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
feel O
obliged O
to O
leave O
a O
comment... O

the O
service B-TARGET
was O
close O
to O
absolute O
zero O
and O
the O
server B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
friendly O
but... O
if O
the O
buffer B-TARGET
was O
correct, O
I O
wouldn't O
come O
here O
to O
make O
a O
comment.. O

I O
took O
a O
bath O
with O
fries! O

Oh O
my O
god, O
fries B-TARGET
not O
well O
cooked, O
cold O
and O
that O
barely O
come O
out O
of O
the O
fridge... O
the O
bavette B-TARGET
aie O
aie O
aie, O
it O
has O
baigned O
in O
the O
oil O
and O
no O
taste... O

I O
think O
I'll O
grab O
onto O
the O
dessert O
with O
the O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
lol, O
and O
I O
drink O
a O
really O
delicious O
mousse! O

No O
taste, O
worse O
than O
the O
metro O
one... O
even O
discount O
chocolate O
mousses O
are O
better.... O

I O
really O
wondered O
if O
my O
guys O
were O
aware O
of O
the O
m... O
they O
were O
serving.... O

I O
was O
sick O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
afternoon, O
the O
meal B-TARGET
there O
is O
ss O
doubt O
for O
something!! O

to O
run O
away O
if O
you O
take O
the O
steak, O
fries O
and O
a O
foam!!! O

I O
will O
not O
take O
the O
risk O
to O
test O
the O
other O
dishes... O

The O
best O
streetscape B-TARGET
with O
its O
authentic O
poutres O
and O
charpentes O
of O
spacious O
tables O
of O
price O
and O
a O
rare O
price O
quality O
ratio O
with O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
makes O
home. O

Different O
menus B-TARGET
at O
12.5€, O
15.80€ O
and O
18.90€ O
that O
combine O
entrance O
+ O
dinner O
+ O
dessert!!! O
That O
is O
to O
say, O
it O
is O
very O
rare O
in O
St. O

Germain O
des O
Près. O

The O
servers B-TARGET
are O
very O
kind O
and O
patient. O

A O
real O
heart O
attack. O

I O
went O
several O
times O
during O
my O
Parisian O
escapes O
to O
dine O
in O
this O
well-located O
hotel. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

It O
is O
a O
pleasure O
to O
feel O
that O
because O
it O
is O
becoming O
increasingly O
rare. O

Dinner O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
evening O
is O
quite O
normal. O

The O
content O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
is O
equally O
successful: O
copied O
and O
very O
good O
from O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
desserts. O

I O
will O
continue O
to O
enjoy O
a O
good O
time O
at O
this O
hotel B-TARGET
on O
my O
next O
trips O
in O
a O
charming O
setting B-TARGET

We O
were O
initially O
attracted O
by O
a O
sunny O
terrace, B-TARGET
quiet O
and O
by O
its O
card B-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices. O

Since O
then O
we O
have O
had O
lunch O
and O
dinner O
there O
several O
times. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good O
or O
very O
good, O
extremely O
varied O
with O
a O
daily O
menu B-TARGET
of O
fish O
and O
meat O
modified O
daily O
( O
soup B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
capuchino I-TARGET
peas I-TARGET
not O
to O
be O
missed O
) O
It O
is O
a O
family-made O
kitchen B-TARGET
most O
of O
the O
time. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

We O
are O
served O
without O
delay O
and O
with O
good O
cheer. O

I O
recommend O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
of O
a O
mediocrity O
without O
name! O

We O
waited O
15 O
mn O
for O
us O
to O
prepare O
the O
table O
and O
40 O
mn O
after O
ordering O
to O
be O
served O
a O
bourguignon B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
whose O
quality O
and O
taste O
leaves O
to O
be O
desired! O

Almost O
raw O
potatoes B-TARGET
with O
raw O
carrots B-TARGET
and O
a O
tasteless O
and O
uncooked O
sauce! B-TARGET

I O
think O
we O
have O
never O
laughed O
so O
much O
at O
our O
heads! O

No O
communication O
from O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
served O
other O
customers O
arriving O
after O
before O
us O
(entrée O
et O
plat) O
included! O

A O
scandal! O

I O
really O
failed O
to O
leave O
after O
a O
40-minute O
wait O
when O
I O
saw O
the O
seat O
arrive O
because O
I O
clearly O
found O
the O
management's B-TARGET
behaviour O
excruciating O
and O
reckless. O

A O
tip: O
don't O
put O
your O
foot O
in O
tourist O
attractions O
and O
a O
loss O
of O
time O
and O
money! O

The O
view O
from O
the O
outside O
on O
the O
large B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
bottle I-TARGET
shelf I-TARGET
attracted O
us. O

So O
we O
returned O
to O
this O
resto O
bar O
with O
wines O
at O
the O
hyper O
original O
deco! B-TARGET

The O
servers B-TARGET
are O
adorable, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
and O
the O
tips O
for O
choosing O
it O
are O
top! O

Ideal O
for O
passing O
an O
apero O
with O
a O
grilled O
ham O
dish. O

We O
were O
less O
attracted O
to O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
found O
a O
bit O
expensive O
versus O
the O
quality O
offered O
although O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
fresh O
and O
that's O
important. O

In O
a O
quiet O
street, B-TARGET
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
warm, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
comfortable. O

In O
family O
or O
among O
friends, O
the O
tonality O
of O
the O
music B-TARGET
at O
the O
appropriate O
height, O
allows O
to O
hold O
a O
conversation O
without O
shouting, O
while O
enjoying O
excellent O
dishes, B-TARGET
nicely O
presented O
and O
very O
tasty, O
served O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
accompanied O
by O
very O
good O
wines. B-TARGET

Do O
it O
again!! O

I O
am O
well O
aware O
that O
this O
opinion O
will O
not O
change O
anything, O
the O
bar B-TARGET
being O
placed O
in O
such O
a O
way O
as O
to O
always O
be O
able O
to O
attract O
tourists, O
but O
good, O
such O
a O
scandalous O
place B-TARGET
deserves O
to O
be O
denounced. O

The O
server B-TARGET
we O
inherited O
is O
an O
old O
carpenter O
whose O
impoliteness O
reflects O
his O
disdain O
for O
his O
profession O
and O
his O
lack O
of O
self-esteem. O

This O
unpleasant O
service B-TARGET
is O
rewarded O
with O
an O
incomprehensible O
card, B-TARGET
at O
exorbitant O
prices. O

We O
had O
a O
glass O
each, O
which O
was O
not O
even O
clean. O

It O
is O
a O
scandal. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
well O
located O
I O
find. O

We O
have O
entered, O
and O
the, O
person O
to O
welcome O
us... O

A O
TV O
to O
turn O
on, O
but O
we O
really O
waited O
5 O
minutes O
before O
seeing O
someone, O
who O
asked O
us O
to O
go O
into O
the O
restaurant O
next O
door... O

Not O
too O
bad, O
but O
I O
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
be O
able O
to O
discuss O
with O
my O
spouse O
without O
being O
listened O
to O
by O
one O
of O
the O
maids.. B-TARGET

At O
the O
meal O
level, O
it O
was O
fast O
enough O
to O
be O
served. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
was O
quite O
good, O
but O
everything O
is O
of O
course O
frozen O
and O
it's O
a O
pity O
I O
had O
my O
dessert O
when O
my O
husband O
had O
finished! O

We O
discovered O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
Groupon, O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
without O
this O
offer. O

Clearly O
it's O
our O
canteen O
because O
we O
work O
right O
next O
door. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room O
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

nice O
to O
have O
a O
drink O
after O
work. O

ah: O
when O
it O
gets O
a O
little O
fresh, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
heated O
and O
they O
put O
blankets O
on O
the O
chairs, O
it O
helps O
:) O

One O
of O
the O
rare O
restaurants O
in O
the O
neighborhood. O

Bond O
of O
employees O
of O
the O
neighbourhood O
enterprises. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
correct O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
are O
very O
expensive. O

No O
meat O
on O
the O
map. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
and O
plentiful O
tiramisu. B-TARGET

To O
avoid O
winter O
because O
few O
indoor O
covers O
and O
covered O
terrace O
is O
not O
sufficiently O
heated. O

The O
excellent O
reviews O
of O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
were O
confirmed O
at O
the O

The O

3 O
tables O
and O
3 O
desserts. O

But O
the O
essentials O
remain O
clearly O
the O
turtle O
dorade, B-TARGET
the O
cajun B-TARGET
shrimp, I-TARGET
the O
gnocchi B-TARGET
d'agria I-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
truffle, I-TARGET
the O
back B-TARGET
of O
the O
turtle O
to O
the O
plancha O
(specially O
cooked O
and O
served O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
sausages). O

The O
wine B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
is O
also O
short O
and O
makes O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
Côtes O
du O
Rhône O
and O
Languedoc O
Roussillon O
by O
highlighting O
affordable O
wines, B-TARGET
some O
of O
which O
come O
from O
recognised O
producers. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

The O
sommelier B-TARGET
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
change O
a O
bottle O
with O
a O
defect. O

Ambiance B-TARGET
bistrot O
chic. O

A O
bit O
noisy O
but O
as O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
seemed O
filled O
every O
night... O

Only O
the O
famous O
candy O
bar O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
missing! O

A O
good O
address B-TARGET
at O
two O
steps O
from O
the O
star. B-TARGET

Another O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
gradually O
loses O
quality. O

The O
deco B-TARGET
is O
great, O
I O
am O
rather O
a O
fan, O
even O
though O
the O
preference O
goes O
to O
the O
Deco O
type O
recup O
or O
industrial, O
this O
romantic O
deco O
type O
I O
rather O
like. O

In O
the O
interior B-TARGET
we O
are O
quiet O
and O
if O
you O
like O
to O
see O
the O
world O
pass O
we O
sit O
on O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
in O
summer O
from O
elsewhere O
or O
I O
spend O
ps O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
with O
friends O
to O
watch O
people O
pass. O

Once O
again O
the O
problem O
as O
in O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
resto O
finally O
the O
problem O
lies O
in O
the O
food B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
at O
the O
level, O
nor O
the O
address, O
nor O
the O
effort O
made O
at O
déco. B-TARGET

A O
few O
years O
ago, O
the O
heart-shaped O
burger B-TARGET
was O
a O
must-have, O
it O
has O
now O
become O
common, O
I O
don't O
even O
finish O
it O
anymore. O

I O
loved O
the O
decor... B-TARGET

I O
appreciated O
the O
history B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
places. O

New O
we O
had O
oysters, O
rose O
shrimp O
and O
lobster O
in O
the O
entrance, O
the O
products B-TARGET
were O
quality. O

The O
shrimp B-TARGET
were O
firm O
and O
excellent. O

the O
lobster B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
bit O
small, O
probably O
from O
Canada. O

Then, O
the O
bouillabaisse O
in O
2 O
services... O

The O
soup B-TARGET
is O
first O
of O
all O
very O
good, O
generous O
in O
croûtons... O

Next, O
the O
very O
fine O
fish, B-TARGET
one O
of O
the O
fish O
was O
full O
of O
stops, O
it's O
a O
pity O
but O
good... O

This O
does O
not O
change O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
bouillabaisse... B-TARGET

For O
dessert, O
a O
pancake O
and O
a O
big O
marnier O
stew. O

Nice O
success O
on O
the O
suffered, B-TARGET
attention O
size O
impressive!! O
Fond O
well O
in O
the O
mouth, O
not O
heavy O
at O
all! O

It O
was O
a O
very O
good O
breakfast. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located O
on O
the O
top O
of O
Champs O
Elysée! O

Decoration B-TARGET
level O
this O
remains O
very O
inventive O
and O
changes O
from O
the O
ordinary O
decoration. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
correct O
for O
the O
prices O
applied. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
busy O
with O
the O
different O
tables O
so O
do O
not O
expect O
special O
attention O
to O
you! O

Restaurant B-TARGET
to O
try O
(at O
least O
once) O
to O
give O
you O
an O
idea. O

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
with O
views B-TARGET
of O
the O
Eiffel O
Tower O
it O
is O
certain O
but O
and O
there O
is O
really O
a O
but O
beyond O
the O
prohibitive O
prices O
for O
a O
very O
medium O
dinner B-TARGET
in O
quality O
and O
very O
pretention O
in O
presentation... O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
deplorable, O
the O
suppliers O
have O
to O
take O
the O
order, O
they O
forget O
to O
bring O
the O
water O
carafe, O
they O
ignore O
our O
hands O
up O
and O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
add O

For O
goose O
tourists O
and O
more O

It O
was O
5 O
years O
ago O
that O
we O
did O
not O
come O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant O
that O
offers O
a O
superb O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
a O
nice O
neighbourhood B-TARGET
of O
Paris... O

But O
my O
god O
what O
disaster O
at O
the O
level O
of O
service B-TARGET
and O
cuisine. B-TARGET

At O
our O
arrival O
3 O
servers B-TARGET
and O
waitresses B-TARGET
passed O
us O
before O
we O
were O
simply O
addressed O
the O
word. O

The O
arrival O
of O
the O
manager B-TARGET
was O
caricatured O
with O
her O
chiffon O
table O
plan O
trying O
to O
place O
us O
inside O
despite O
our O
express O
request O
of O
the O
terrace. O

In O
the O
end, O
we O
won. O

Sitting O
on O
uncomfortable O
garden O
chairs O
we O
await O
the O
aperture O
that O
arrives O
very O
quickly O
the O
only O
hike O
is O
the O
difference O
between O
our O
two O
glasses B-TARGET
for O
the O
same O
alcohol O
1/4 O
different O
quantity. O

I O
pass O
you O
the O
meal O
whose O
products B-TARGET
are O
any. O

Even O
Pierre O
Herme's O
desserts, B-TARGET
which O
I O
would O
ask O
not O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
be O
distributed O
in O
this O
facility, O
have O
been O
served. O

Too O
fresh. O

I O
had O
asked O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
to O
accompany O
him. O

Since O
I O
did O
not O
arrive O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
addition, O
I O
note O
that O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
problem O
to O
bring O
it. O
and O

well O
you O
don't O
believe O
me O
to O
bring O
it O
with O
the O
addition O
by O
telling O
me O
that O
it O
was O
already O
served. O

What O
he O
had O
forgotten O
to O
say O
was O
that O
he O
was O
also O
counted O
in O
the O
addition. O

In O
short, O
I O
don't O
know O
where O
the O
former O
owners O
went, O
but O
someone O
needs O
to O
rebuild O
this O
facility. B-TARGET

Waiting O
for O
a O
single O
word O
of O
order O
not O
to O
go O
there. O

Ah O
yes O
I O
forgot O
not O
to O
look O
at O
the O
map B-TARGET
displayed O
in O
the O
window O
you O
will O
see O
there O
at O
least O
2 O
dead O
flies O
crushed O
I O
don't O
dare O
put O
a O
foot O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

For O
the O
flies O
I O
have O
the O
photo. O

But O
I O
do O
not O
publish O
it O
for O
sensitive O
souls O

A O
table B-TARGET
that O
keeps O
the O
road O
in O
a O
neighbourhood O
where O
tables O
change O
very O
quickly? O

Sophisticated O
but O
not O
too O
much, O
of O
the O
world O
but O
not O
at O
all O
noisy, O
at O
the O
table O
or O
at O
the O
counter. O

Very O
nice O
menu B-TARGET
at O
35 O
euros O
for O
lunch O
which O
changes O
all O
the O
time. O

At O
the O
card, B-TARGET
more O
expensive, O
the O
wall O
sole B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
delicacy O
(49 O
euros O
still) O
and O
everyone O
knows O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
succeed. O

The O
veal B-TARGET
shore I-TARGET
as O
well. O

Wine B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the O
glass O
(hopefully!). O

Exquisite O
gourmet B-TARGET
coffee. I-TARGET

In O
any O
case O
regular O
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting B-TARGET
at O
two O
steps O
from O
the O
Disabled. O

What O
a O
pleasure O
it O
is O
to O
be O
welcomed, B-TARGET
this O
big O
smile, O
this O
bite, O
all O
very O
natural, O
we O
are O
no O
longer O
used O
to O
this O
friendly O
quality, O
especially O
in O
Paris! O

And O
the O
setting!!! B-TARGET
And O
the O
kitchen!!! B-TARGET
We O
also O
come O
and O
especially O
for O
that O
and O
our O
last O
lunch B-TARGET
was, O
as O
always, O
extra: O
Turbot B-TARGET
cooked O
with O
rhubarbe, O
sauce B-TARGET
creamed I-TARGET
with O
its O
purée O
de O
panais, O
floating O
island B-TARGET
and O
praline B-TARGET
pie...the O
all O
round O
of O
an O
excellent O
Beaujolais...what B-TARGET
happiness O
and O
that's O
how O
all O
the O
customers O
become O
regulars, O
or O
rather O
friends. O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful. O

We O
ordered O
two O
champagne B-TARGET
pools I-TARGET
which O
were O
served O
at O
the O
end O
of O
20 O
min... O
and O
without O
ice O
cream!!! O

When O
asked O
by O
a O
server B-TARGET
who O
has O
been O
soaked O
in O
vinegar O
for O
54 O
years O
whether O
our O
order O
has O
been O
accepted, O
he O
literally O
annoys O
us O
by O
telling O
us O
that O
champagne O
is O
being O
sought O
(seemingly O
directly O
in O
Reims) O

In O
short, O
the O
servers B-TARGET
do O
not O
even O
take O
the O
trouble O
to O
speak O
in O
English O
to O
the O
poor O
tourists O
failed O
here, O
the O
silicone O
patron, B-TARGET
bottled, O
until O
to O
have O
their O
face O
fixed O
(that O
must O
be O
the O
reason O
for O
his O
cruel O
absence O
of O
smile) O
pavane O
on O
the O
terrace O
but O
does O
not O
advance O
orders O
faster... O

In O
short, O
go O
away O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
ruin O
your O
day O
with O
arrogant O
people! O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
welcoming, O
unfortunately O
they O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
describe O
the O
dishes, O
the O
original O
names O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
incomprehensible. O

Once O
served O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
to O
feel O
bad, O
my O
dish B-TARGET
was O
boiled O
under O
an O
absurd O
amount O
of O
insipid O
blue B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
while O
my O
friend's O
salad B-TARGET
was O
full O
of O
oil, O
fat O
and O
fat. O

For O
Info O
we O
all O
2 O
fell O
sick O
in O
the O
night. O

To O
flee!!! O

It O
is O
a O
very O
very O
nice O
address... B-TARGET
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
remarkable O
because O
the O
dishes O
are O
perfect, O
the O
products B-TARGET
ultra O
fresh O
and O
rather O
seasonal, O
everything O
is O
made O
at O
home. O

There O
is O
a O
map O
and O
boxes O
for O
the O
formulas. O

It O
is O
a O
mix O
of O
creative O
proposals O
but O
also O
of O
great O
classics. O

The O
table B-TARGET
is O
perfect O
from O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
dessert, O
which O
is O
not O
so O
common. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
is O
focused O
but O
very, O
very O
good, O
in O
both O
white O
and O
red. O

We O
are O
well O
within O
the O
logic O
of O
selection O
and O
quality. O

These O
are O
not O
the O
first O
prices, O
but O
the O
quality-price B-TARGET
ratio I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
excellent. I-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

It O
is O
to O
conclude O
a O
very O
nice O
address, B-TARGET
a O
rare O
alliance O
of O
tradition O
and O
modernity, O
beautiful O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
which O
remains O
readable, O
pleasant, O
sophisticated O
without O
too O
much. O

Not O
surprisingly, O
this O
is O
often O
advised O
by O
gastronomic O
critics. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
ideally O
located O
for O
business O
meals. O

However, O
it O
is O
absolutely O
not O
worth O
turning O
around, O
except O
to O
see O
and O
be O
seen. O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O
clean O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
very O
helpful. O

If O
you O
want O
two O
accompaniments, B-TARGET
it O
is O
even O
counted O
as O
a O
supplement!! O

As O
for O
the O
service, B-TARGET
it O
is O
really O
to O
be O
reviewed. O

Ordering O
and O
arrival O
of O
the O
entrance O
endlessly... O
and O
then O
the O
dishes O
that O
do O
not O
arrive O
together O
and O
half O
of O
the O
accompanying O
things O
that O
are O
missing. O

Short O
to O
avoid!!! O

A O
little O
complicated O
menu B-TARGET
between O
Bo O
Boun's, O
salads O
and O
the O
rest. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
have O
a O
good O
appetit O
because O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
copied O
and O
good. O

And O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
pleasant! O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
so O
uncomfortable, O
we O
are O
a O
bit O
on O
each O
other O
and O
if O
you O
are O
fat, O
prefer O
the O
terrace. O

Staff B-TARGET
are O
often O
overwhelmed, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
key O
to O
success O
and O
reputation. O

Super O
menu, B-TARGET
unprecedented O
and O
surprising O
flavours, O
very O
pleasant O
setting....thank B-TARGET
you O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
general O
impression O
is O
served O
by O
a O
rude O
and O
unpleasant O
service! B-TARGET

Too O
much O
want O
to O
avoid O
the O
codes O
of O
the O
gastronomic O
restaurant O
(and O
especially O
the O
excess O
of O
zeal O
that O
can O
sometimes O
characterize O
the O
service B-TARGET
), O
Chateaubriand O
goes O
too O
far O
in O
my O
sense! O

Of O
course O
it's O
an O
honour O
to O
be O
able O
to O
taste O
the O
inventive O
cuisine B-TARGET
of O
a O
chef O
like O
Inaki O
Aizpitarte... O
but O
whatever O
the O
reputation O
of O
the O
establishment O
and O
its O
success, O
I O
think O
customers O
have O
the O
right O
to O
expect O
to O
be O
served O
by O
at O
least O
friendly O
people O
(even O
if O
it's O
because O
they O
pay)! O

I, O
for O
my O
part, O
was O
sent O
back O
for O
my O
purposes O
because O
I O
had O
the O
misfortune O
of O
asking O
for O
details O
on O
the O
composition O
of O
a O
dessert O
that O
was O
not O
presented O
to O
us O
(in O
this O
case O
the O
tocino O
del O
cielo, O
a O
classic O
of O
the O
house... O
we O
should O
have O
known O
that O
maybe O
that’s O
why?). O

And O
the O
person O
who O
accompanied O
me, O
shy, O
she O
allowed O
a O
remark O
with O
a O
big O
smile O
on O
the O
thickness O
of O
the O
St-Nectaire B-TARGET
section I-TARGET
that O
had O
been O
served O
to O
her O
(less O
than O
2mm) O
to O
hear O
her O
answer O
a O
"Ah O
good..." O
dry O
and O
cold. O

In O
short, O
it O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
success O
of O
the O
establishment O
seems O
to O
be O
mounted O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
servers B-TARGET
who O
have O
terrified, O
or O
even O
destroyed O
what O
could O
have O
been O
a O
very O
good O
moment... O

ps: O

Very O

The O
"fait O

is O
actually O
a O

No O

For O
example, O
if O
you O
ask O
for O
fries O

of O
the O

you O
will O
get O
the O
planned O
lining O
and O
a O
fries B-TARGET
(frozen) I-TARGET
supplement I-TARGET
at O
5 O

In O

Arriving O
around O
12:50 O
p.m. O
in O
a O
crowded O

we O
were O
offered O
a O
very O
large O
table O
at O
the O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
very O

It O
takes O
the O

on O
an O
exceeded O
tone O
by O
returning O
to O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
honest, O
I O
chose O
a O
hot O
beef O

my O

the O

at O
13 O

Honest O

a O

good O
gastro O
address O
at O
a O
nice O
price... O

The O
first O
table O
where O
we O
are O
installed, O
the O
lamp O
on O
top O
is O
grilled, O
half O
darkness O
and O
the O
candles O
on O
the O
side O
seem O
well O
covered O
with O
dust... O

Just O
like O
the O
horrible O
curtains B-TARGET
that O
hang O
over O
our O
heads. O

We O
turn O
to O
look O
at O
it O
and O
realize O
that O
it O
is O
in O
fact O
a O
prefabricated O
background O
course O
with O
a O
suspicious O
taste, O
like O
the O
photos O
of O
vintage O
prostitutes O
covering O
the O
walls O
in O
glittering O
frames. O

It O
was O
for O
the O
framework... O

Kitchenette, B-TARGET
a O
complete O
lack O
of O
surprise, O
discovery O
or O
audacity... O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
ridiculous, O
three O
holes O
of O
beef B-TARGET
stick I-TARGET
(beef O
of O
25 O
years O
probably, O
so O
the O
meat O
is O
red) O
and O
a O
fine O
lamb O
of O
dauphin B-TARGET
gratin, I-TARGET
all O
bathing O
in O
an O
insipid O
sauce B-TARGET
that O
actually O
seemed O
to O
be... O
water. O

The O
tuna B-TARGET
is O
so O
crude O
that O
it's O
better O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Japanese, O
but O
my O
colleague O
likes O
it, O
the O
tunas... O

We O
would O
like O
to O
stop O
the O
fresh, O
but O
there O
was O
dessert: O
the O
beautiful O
poire O
Hélène O
"revisitée", O
where O
how O
a O
ice B-TARGET
cream O
turns O
into O
cream O
in O
a O
marble O
of O
chocolate O
where O
fruit O
pieces O
surnage. O

As O
someone O
who O
never O
writes O
an O
opinion, O
I O
say O
to O
myself O
this O
evening O
that O
it O
was O
perhaps O
a O
lack O
of O
taste O
on O
my O
part... O

Yes O
it O
must O
be O
that, O
tonight, O
I O
lost O
the O
taste, O
the O
taste O
of O
clapping O
100€ O
in O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
without O
taste O
or O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

We O
were O
among O
friends O
on O
the O
evening O
of O
March O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
the O
anniversary O
of O
one O
of O
them. O

We O
arrived O
at O
this O
pub O
restaurant O
for O
dinner. O

But O
because O
we O
were O
too O
many O
(13 O
people), O
we O
were O
installed O
on O
the O
floor O
(by O
making O
it O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
the O
ground O
floor O
was O
for O
regulars O
and O
football O
fans O
and O
that O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
consume O
we O
had O
to O
go O
back O
to O
order) O
in O
an O
Iounge B-TARGET
space I-TARGET
barely O
lit O
to O
be O
able O
to O
read O
the O
menu O
(we O
had O
to O
use O
the O
lamps O
of O
our O
smartphone). O

After O
explaining O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
align O
one O
table O
next O
to O
another, O
we O
restarted. O

The O
dinner O
begins O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
dish. O

In O
the O
part O
about O
burgers B-TARGET
it O
was O
written O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
order O
the O
burger O
without O
bread O
(interest?). O

In O
asking O
a O
waiter O
if O
taking O
this O
option O
would O
allow O
a O
discount O
on O
the O
price O
(already O
expensive O
enough O
for O
quality), O
the O
manager B-TARGET
came O
by O
saying O
that O
the O
price O
was O
not O
changing O
(after O
that O
comes O
an O
explanation O
on O
the O
margin O
that O
the O
restaurant O
was O
then O
making), O
and O
later O
replied O
"we O
are O
a O
restaurant O
so O
our O
goal O
is O
to O
make O
the O
margin" O
(a O
customer O
relationship O
expert O
that O
one). O

In O
summary O
(because O
it's O
long O
to O
say), O
we O
spent O
an O
evening O
a O
bit O
terrified O
by O
the O
image O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
(the O
state O
of O
which O
leaves O
to O
be O
desired), O
a O
table O
service B-TARGET
worthy O
of O
an O
adolescent O
canteen, O
and O
no O
small O
words O
of O
apology O
or O
any O
remission O
(when O
you O
have O
to O
make O
the O
margin O
by O
any O
means...) O
to O
come O
back O
with O
a O
smile O
(it O
was O
not O
won). O

To O
be O
tested O
by O
members O
of O
the O
evening O
in O
advance, O
we O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time O
for O
some O
and O
the O
last O
time O
for O
everyone O
that O
we O
came O
to O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

To O
say O
that O
this O
brewery O
is O
joining O
tourist O
groups... O

What O
a O
shame O
for O
French O
gastronomy!!! O

This O
day O
I O
wanted O
a O
beef O
turtle. O

I O
have O
a O
family O
who O
eat O
with O
this O
badge O
so O
I O
join O
them. O

So O
on O
the O
menu, O
a O
fried O
beef O
tab, O
a O
fried O
steak O
turtle, O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
seed O
with O
puree. O

Let's O
be O
simple,.. O

EVERY O
VIANDES B-TARGET
ARE O
NOT O
GOUT O
AND O
SECHES!!! O

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
home, O
but O
they O
are O
Favourite O
and O
MOLLASSON O
Favourites. O

Pure B-TARGET
less O
good O
than O
the O
canteen. O

Go O
away! O

We O
must O
not O
be O
frightened O
of O
this O
arnaque. O

I O
wish O
they O
were O
fermented! O

Daily O
menu O

- O
a O
smoked B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
entrance O
on O
excellent O
celeri O

- O
beef B-TARGET
sausage O
with O
very O
good O
tagliatelle O

A O
little O
expensive O
wine B-TARGET

Two O
small O
remarks O

- O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
overheated O
which O
is O
really O
unpleasant O

- O
the O
water B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
caraffe O
is O
not O
fraiche O
(to O
link O
with O
the O
previous O
point???) O

Very O
competitive O
for O
the O
neighbourhood O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
what O
we O
have O
in O
our O
basement. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
a O
hurry, O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
place! B-TARGET

But O
what O
bothered O
me O
was O
the O
following: O
only O
two O
minutes O
after O
ordering, O
we O
had O
already O
served, O
would O
the O
pans B-TARGET
be O
made O
in O
advance O
and O
then O
heated? O

The O
prices O
of O
beverages B-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
very O
high O
(4.5 O
euros O
for O
a O
can B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
coca..). I-TARGET

In O
short, O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
extraordinary, O
can O
even O
be O
prepared O
long O
in O
advance? O

I O
will O
not O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
will O
not O
return! O

Very O
Parisian O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
you've O
seen O
me O
very O
much! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

Very O
medium O
kitchen, B-TARGET
chicken B-TARGET
version O
crêpe O
archi O
dry O
with O
a O
handful O
of O
beans O
and O
all O
this O
at O
an O
exorbitant O
price! O

The O
sandwich B-TARGET
club I-TARGET
has O
nothing O
special O
and O
the O
Vietnamese B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
is O
very O
dry O
without O
any O
sauce. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
overloaded O
but O
it O
makes O
the O
charm O
of O
the O
place. O

I O
went O
there O
by O
chance O
with O
friends O
one O
evening O
for O
the O
aperitif O
and O
I O
came O
back O
there O
for O
lunch O
because O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
formula I-TARGET
at O
15 O
€ O
had O
pleased O
me. O

You O
will O
not O
find O
the O
pseudo O
tapas O
that O
are O
found O
on O
all O
terraces O
but O
only O
the O
real O
Spanish B-TARGET
recipes: I-TARGET
discounts O
of O
calamars, O
jamon O
croquetas O
y O
queso, O
tomato O
bread, O
bacalao O
croquetas, O
tortilla, O
serrano, O
piquillos, O
ink O
calamars, O
ham O
artichauts... O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
simply O
delicious O
sangria! B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
like O
the O
rest: O
Catalan O
cream, O
Basque O
cake, O
brebis O
cheese O
and O
black O
cherries O
concoction... O

The O
servers B-TARGET
don't O
all O
speak O
very O
well O
French O
but O
they O
are O
very O
nice O
(and O
their O
Spanish O
accent O
strengthens O
the O
authentic O
side O
of O
the O
place B-TARGET
). O

The O
only O
criticism O
is O
that O
there O
are O
too O
many O
tables O
and O
too O
little O
space, O
so O
it's O
too O
early. O

But O
I'll O
go O
back O
there O
with O
my O
eyes O
closed! O

15€ O
for O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with O
two O
ingredients: O
green O
salad O
and O
2 O
slices O
of O
smoked O
salmon. O

It O
emerges O
with O
hunger O
and O
the O
bad O
impression O
of O
being O
rained, O
with O
the O
way O
(The O
salmon O
is O
arranged O
so O
that O
it O
hides O
the O
green O
salad O
forest O
that O
gives O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
consisting O
plate). O

If O
you O
are O
hungry, O
flee! O

We O
were O
invited O
yesterday O
by O
Friends O
to O
celebrate O
an O
anniversary O
among O
friends. O

Depending O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
place, B-TARGET
a O
good O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
good O
quality O
engloutis O
tapas, B-TARGET
we O
finally O
spent O
an O
excellent O
evening O
with O
our O
friends. O

The O
Patron B-TARGET
at O
the O
air O
RUSTRE O
at O
the O
beginning, O
but O
it O
plays O
a O
"game" O
and O
is O
super O
ahead O
with O
its O
customers! O

A O
simple O
place B-TARGET
or O
spend O
a O
pleasant O
evening! O

We O
had O
reserved O
for O
the O
20th O
anniversary O
of O
our O
son O
(April), O
what O
a O
disappointment, O
a O
partially O
ruined O
anniversary! O

We O
had O
negotiated O
the O
menu O
with O
the O
manager O
and O
were O
confident O
since O
we O
had O
celebrated O
my O
beautiful O
father's O
70th O
birthday O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
were O
completely O
satisfied. O

Of O
course O
we O
didn't O
have O
a O
big O
budget, O
15€ O
per O
person O
entrance, O
bread, O
cake. O

But O
no O
quality O
on O
the O
table, B-TARGET
no O
presentation, O
you O
would O
think O
of O
a O
meal O
you O
do O
at O
home. O

In O
addition, O
among O
our O
tables, B-TARGET
we O
had O
a O
panel O
of O
pieces O
of O
meat O
from O
the O
smallest O
or O
the O
largest! O

The O
room O
was O
very O
clean B-TARGET
and O
comfortable. O
The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful. O

Also, O
away O
from O
the O
micro O
wave!!! O
with O
green B-TARGET
beans I-TARGET
cooked O
steam, O
not O
returned, O
without O
sauce, O
shortly O
unfortunate! O

The O
cake: O
a O
strawberry, B-TARGET
we O
had O
been O
looking O
for O
the O
strawberries O
and O
chewing O
too O
much O
cream. O

Fortunately, O
the O
alcohol-free B-TARGET
cocktails I-TARGET
and O
coffees B-TARGET
were O
good O
and O
available, O
but O
we O
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
pay O
for O
them O
and O
have O
something O
better O
on O
the O
table. B-TARGET
A O
minimum O
of O
presentation O
is O
something O
that O
can O
make O
a O
difference O
in O
the O
eyes! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
kind, O
just O
a O
little O
worried O
with O
taking O
the O
3 O
tables O
to O
get O
the O
salmon O
away O
but O
otherwise O
nothing O
to O
reproach O
him. O

We O
reported O
to O
the O
room O
manager, O
he O
was O
very O
embarrassed, O
he O
told O
us O
he O
would O
come O
back. O

We O
learned O
later, O
change O
owner O
and O
cook O
since O
our O
last O
visit. O

Located O
between O
the O
oaks O
and O
the O
square O
courtyard, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
no O
exception. O

Very O
curious O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
has O
nothing O
sensational, O
I O
burned O
the O
palace O
with O
enemies. O

Canton B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
was O
dry O
and O
I O
waited O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
mns O
2 O
unfortunate O
ice O
balls. O

Small O
kitchen B-TARGET
of O
low O
quality O
and O
not O
homemade. O

We O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
better O
meal B-TARGET
with O
less O
speed O
and O
more O
flavour. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
suggests O
that O
everything O
is O
going O
well, O
but O
nothing O
is O
happening. O

Amounts O
come O
with O
a O
Groupon O
coupon. O

We O
were O
very O
well O
received. O

Fast O
and O
quality O
service. B-TARGET

Packer O
of O
products, B-TARGET
beautiful O
presentations. O

Address B-TARGET

be O
retained. O

Very O
soon. O

in O
a O
small O
street O
of O
Menton, O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
not O
very O
large O
by O
size O

Nice O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
city. O

A O
little O
aging. O

Menton's O
classic O
food. B-TARGET

To O
go O
there O
from O
time O
to O
time. O

Relatively O
expensive O
for O
quality/price. O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
outside. O

Home B-TARGET
to O
the O
most O
sterile, O
almost O
the O
impression O
of O
disturbing. O

We O
order O
2 O
pizzas, B-TARGET
of O
the O
correct O
appearance O
but O
bathing O
in O
the O
oil, O
ok O
we O
are O
in O
the O
south O
so O
we O
stay O
out. O

After O
tasting O
it O
is O
the O
drama, O
a O
cailloux O
in O
my O
friend's O
pizza. B-TARGET

I O
call O
the O
maid B-TARGET
to O
complain, O
no O
excuse, O
for O
her O
it's O
normal O
because O
it's O
fresh O
mushrooms O
and O
tells O
us O
that O
next O
time O
they O
will O
make O
frozen... O

After O
being O
taken O
by O
us O
and O
apologizing O
she O
finally O
apologized O
timidly O
and O
offered O
us O
a O
coffee... O

To O
flee O

Obviously, O
we O
disturb O
the O
maid. B-TARGET

The O
mojito B-TARGET
is O
abominable, O
tasty, O
much O
too O
sweet, O
lemon O
balanced O
as O
it O
is O
in O
the O
glass... O

We O
did O
not O
have O
the O
pleasure O
of O
tasting O
the O
kitchen, O
unfortunately! O

Seasonal O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
excellent O
small O
country O
currants B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
a O
finely O
cooked O
magret. B-TARGET

In O
the O
open O
kitchen O
you O
can O
feel O
the O
patron's O
passion O
and O
on O
the O
terrace, O
despite O
the O
crowd, O
you O
can O
appreciate O
the O
kindness O
and O
advice O
of O
his O

To O

In O
August O
2014, O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
eat O
pizzas, O
salads O
and O
more O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Serveur B-TARGET
passed O
while O
the O
terrace O
was O
not O
filled. O

The O
meals O
arrived O
at O
the O
counter, O
which O
made O
my O
son O
and O
little O
son O
had O
their O
pizzas O
10 O
minutes O
after O
us. O

Very O
disappointed O
by O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET

I O
highly O
recommend O
breakfast O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
with O
spa O
package. O

A O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
city O
centre, O
safe. O

I O
will O
not O
take O
back O
everything O
that O
has O
been O
said O
because O
everything O
is O
true!!! O

Extremely O
expensive, O
cold O
factory. O

My O
experience O
took O
place O
around O
a O
question O
to O
one O
of O
the O
servers O
for O
a O
carafe O
of O
water O
after O
consuming O
more O
than O
50 O
euros. O

The O
long-haired, O
brown, O
thirty-year-old O
waiter B-TARGET
tried O
to O
answer O
me O
with O
a O
very O
disgraceful O
tone, O
saying O
that O
chamonix O
water O
is O
payable. O

He O
argued O
that O
he O
had O
to O
surrender O
to O
my O
application O
according O
to O
the O
legislation O
in O
force O
in O
our O
country, O
and O
he O
ignored O
me O
openly, O
and O
just O
proposed O
to O
consult O

Honourable. O

The O

very O
helpful O
and O

The O

to O
conclude O
the O
extraordinary O

at O
3842 O
m. O

Very O
good O
for O
the O
boss O
and O
his O
team. B-TARGET

But O
no O
more. O

The O
room B-TARGET
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful. O

We O
took O
a O
hot O
stone O
for O
two. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
a O
little O
just O
in O
quantities O
to O
my O
taste. O

The O
homemade O
mayonnaise B-TARGET
sauces I-TARGET
were O
good O
but O
without O
more, O
they O
lacked O
a O
little O
flavor. O

The O
tag B-TARGET
was O
correct. O

In O
short, O
the O
meal B-TARGET
was O
not O
bad O
but O
I O
was O
not O
packed. O

Divin!! O

A O
very O
good O
time O

in O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

My O
wife O
and O
I O
have O
been O
reconciled. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
chose O
were O
very O
copied. O

Short O
to O
report O
from O
famous O
for O
two O
months!!! O

It O
was O
as O
if O
noble O
products B-TARGET
had O
disappeared. O

It O
is O
not O
just O
the O
hamper O
in O
life O

From O
the O
reception B-TARGET
to O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
everything O
is O
low-end, O
thankfully O
the O
drawer B-TARGET
is O
there O
to O
trap O
the O

who O
pass O
there. O

what O
a O

a O

who O

I O
spend O
more O
time, O
1:30 O
for O
a O
simple O
meal. O

A O
super O
simple O
card B-TARGET
but O
a O
totally O
lost O
waitress. B-TARGET

Errors O
in O
ordering O
and O
a O
patron B-TARGET
who O
refuses O
to O
change O
the O
dishes O
on O
the O
pretext O
that O
she O
won't O
throw O
the O
chair O
and O
that O
she O
did O
so O
with O
love O
mdr. O

Apparently O
there O
is O
no O
question O
of O
losing O
money O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
she O
invents O
suspicious O
pretexts O
to O
get O
the O
pill O
through. O
All O
room O
is O
in O
my O
opinion O
and O
angry. O

English O
people O
on O
the O
terrace O
pay O
before O
the O
end O
and O
leave. O

I'm O
going O
to O
give O
you O
the O
"beck-takes" O
with O
the O
boss B-TARGET
to O
make O
him O
understand O
that O
his O
reaction O
is O
intolerable O
and O
uncommercial. O

On O
a O
children's O
menu O
that O
has O
never O
been O
asked, O
she O
has O
the O
culot O
to O
announce O
me O
at O
the O
addition, O
that O
she O
offers O
me O
the O
2nd O
ball O
of O
ice O
when O
in O
the O
children's O
menu O
the O
ice O
has O
only O
one O
ball....(no O
comment). O

Restaurant B-TARGET
has O
not O
advised O
and O
above O
all O
banning O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
that O
the O
restaurant O
profession O
is O
deceived O
by O
this O
kind O
of O
pseudo-restaurant O
who O
should O
think O
about O
changing O
profession. O

A O
very O
pink O
but O
pleasant O
setting B-TARGET
for O
dinners O
with O
couples O
or O
friends. O

Very O
well O
presented O
tables B-TARGET
and O
good O
hospitality B-TARGET
with O
loving O
people. O

But O
how O
can O
you O
put O
5 O
stars O
to O
a O
"Asian" O
restaurant O
or O
everything O
is O
just O
heated, O
uncooked O
from O
the O
subway O
or O
promocash. O

There O
are O
even O
fries O
and O
nuggets! O

Really O
very O
depressing! O

In O
short, O
very O
good O
to O
take O
a O
plate O
to O
carry O
(10€) O
and O
eat O
it O
in O
front O
of O
the O
TV. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
restaurant, O
go O
your O
way! O

The B-TARGET
staff O
were O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room B-TARGET
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

Above O
all, O
do O
not O
miss. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room B-TARGET
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

correct. O

but O
an O
impression O
of O
incompleteness. O

We O
are O
there, O
dishes O
of O
the O
day O
tagliatelles O
with O
seafood, O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
but O
some O
delicious, O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
hospitality B-TARGET
very O
mediocre, O
Saint B-TARGET
Jacques I-TARGET
good O
but O
rice B-TARGET
very O
dry, O
in O
short O
certainly O
better O
elsewhere! O

We O
discovered O
this O
beach B-TARGET
cabanon I-TARGET
by O
chance O
and O
it O
was O
an O
excellent O
surprise: O
a O
warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
very O
correct O
dishes, B-TARGET
a O
relaxing O
lounge-beach O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

It O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
the O
team B-TARGET
enjoys O
working O
in O
this O
magical O
place. B-TARGET

This O
will O
be O
our O
must-have O
at O
Cassis! O

Very O
good O
table B-TARGET
in O
a O
street O
behind O
the O
harbour O
so O
without O
having O
to O
challenge O
the O
tourists O
who O
look O
at O
your O
desk. O

In O
this O
restaurant O
you O
will O
find O
a O
fragrant O
provençal B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
presented O
very O
nicely O
and O
in O
generous O
quantities. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

We O
arrived O
at O
2 O
with O
our O
two-month-old O
baby O
in O
a O
pushchair. O

We O
were O
trapped O
in O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
left O
after O
20 O
minutes O
without O
anyone O
bringing O
us O
anything O
but O
a O
carafe O
of O
water. O

I O
have O
eaten O
with O
friends O
in O
this O
restaurant O
and O
I O
find O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
has O
seriously O
deteriorated, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
contains O
2 O
sheets, O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
and O
dessert B-TARGET
are O
baked O
in O
the O
presentation. O

In O
addition, O
the O
reception B-TARGET
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
boss O
is O
cold O
unlike O
the O
very O
nice O
servers. B-TARGET

The O
vessel O
is O
outdated. O

We O
took O
the O
aperitif O
on O
the O
terrace. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
rather O
pleasant O
but O
not O
a O
cacahuette O
or O
an O
olive O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
aperitif O
unfortunately, O
no O
aperitif O
as O
well. O

Inconceivable O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
bar... I-TARGET

How O
can O
we O
call O
it O
a O
restaurant? B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful I-TARGET
and O
helpful. O

The O
next O
time O
we O
are O
passing O
through O
Albertville, O
we O
will O
try O
another O
restaurant, O
can O
someone O
advise O
us O
a??? O

In O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
I O
felt O
at O
home O
having O
had O
a O
restaurant O
of O
the O
same O
kind. O

A O
delicious O
cuisine B-TARGET
made O
with O
love, O
I O
go O
back O
when O
I O
can O
for O
me O
it's O
a O
real O
restaurant B-TARGET

we O
came O
to O
14 O
people O
for O
my O
friend's O
anniversary. O

We O
arrived O
around O
20-21h. O

we O
all O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
very O
wide, O
good O
hot O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
good! O

we O
ordered O
for O
the O
aperitif O
5 O
bottles O
of O
champagne O
+ O
4 O
bottles O
of O
dinner O
wines O
+ O
dishes O
+ O
coffees. O

No O
commercial O
gesture O
to O
pay, O
no O
offer O
or O
offer...??! O

In O
addition, O
one O
of O
the O
people O
to O
order O
a O
tartare, O
it O
was O
served O
10 O
minutes O
after O
everybody.. O
it's O
a O
cold O
plate O
though. O

it's O
a O
pity! O

We O
arrive O
at O
5 O
for O
lunch O
last O
Sunday O
around O
13:30. O

This O
is O
the O
end O
of O
service. O

Entrance: O
cold O
perlan O
friction O
for O
one O
of O
us. O

Three O
cocoons O
of O
sea O
mussels O
arrive O
at O
the O
table, O
at O
the O
opening, O
the O
mussels B-TARGET
of O
one O
of O
them O
are O
covered O
with O
tomatoes O
and O
not O
the O
others. O

We O
ask O
the O
server O
if O
this O
is O
normal. O

After O
verification, O
he O
comes O
back O
and O
tells O
us O
that O
it's O
decoration. O

Some O
mussels B-TARGET
are O
too O
cooked O
and O
others O
not O
enough. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
have O
an O
oil O
taste. O

I O
have O
the O
unpleasant O
surprise O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
my O
cocotte B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
marinière I-TARGET
moule I-TARGET
to O
find O
a O
half O
lemon, O
skin O
included, O
dechiqueté. O

I O
ask O
the O
server O
if O
there O
is O
no O
concern. O

He O
comes O
back O
after O
verification O
and O
tells O
me O
that O
this O
is O
the O
recipe O
for O
sea O
mussels. O

I O
ask O
to O
see O
the O
person O
responsible. O

He O
arrives O
and O
when O
I O
tell O
him O
of O
my O
dissatisfaction O
he O
asks O
me O
to O
"slow O
down". O

We O
immediately O
stop O
the O
meal. O

The O
note O
that O
is O
presented O
to O
us O
is O
defaced O
with O
a O
cocotte O
while O
no O
one O
wants O
to O
eat O
these O
dubious O
mussels. B-TARGET

We O
will O
then O
be O
insulted O
again O
by O
the O
responsible B-TARGET
person O
before O
he O
agrees O
to O
lock O
up O
our O
beverages O
and O
let O
us O
go. O

We O
did O
not O
expect O
great O
cuisine O
in O
this O
very O
touristic O
place B-TARGET
but O
we O
would O
nevertheless O
have O
liked O
to O
be O
able O
to O
have O
lunch O
without O
putting O
our O
health O
in O
danger O
and O
without O
losing O
respect O
over O
the O
market! O

Go O
to O
the O
competitors O
they O
are O
very O
many O
in O
the O
corner!!!! O

For O
the O
first O
time O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
we O
were O
told O
that O
it O
was O
good. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
offered O
are O
original, O
the O
flavors O
are O
embedded O
but O
the O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
not O
at O
your O
disposal. O

18,50 O
€ O
a O
risotto, B-TARGET
where O
I O
looked O
for O
smoked O
salmon O
yet O
advertised, O
that O
I O
unfortunately O
did O
not O
find, O
it O
is O
well O
too O
expensive O
as O
good O
as O
it O
is. O

The O
coloured O
frame B-TARGET
and O
the O
tourist B-TARGET
port I-TARGET
of O
La O
Cotinière O
were O
paid. O

If O
it O
hadn't O
been O
for O
this O
it O
could O
have O
gone, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
has O
been O
catastrophic. O

The O
young O
blonde O
lady O
who O
served O
us O
is O
absolutely O
not O
a O
metier. O

The O
owner's B-TARGET
order O
came O
long O
after O
the O
flight O
was O
over, O
and O
the O
worst O
was O
the O
wine B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
when O
we O
almost O
finished O
our O
meal. O

Unbearable. O

Despite O
a O
delicious O
cuisine B-TARGET
we O
will O
not O
return O
there. O

Very O
nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

A O
small O
room O
with O
an O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
a O
beach O
in O
the O
countryside. O

Deco B-TARGET
and O
refined O
tables O
(cloth O
napkins O
and O
towels...). O

Very O
friendly O
and O
warm O
staff. O

Things B-TARGET
that O
are O
a O
little O
expensive O
but O
very O
good. O

This O
being O
said, O
at O
least O
home O
made O
with O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
of O
very O
good O
quality O
it O
remains O
very O
interesting. O

Copy O
and O
well O
presented O
plates. B-TARGET

Very O
good, O
especially O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
(excellent). O

Coctails B-TARGET
very O
good O
but O
a O
little O
expensive O
for O
the O
quantity O
(5/8€) O

Restaurant B-TARGET
open O
outside O
the O
season. O

Terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
shade O
of O
trees O
very O
pleasant, O
nice O
chairs, B-TARGET
fish B-TARGET
well O
prepared, O
nice O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Don't O
hesitate. O

The O
location O
is O
misleading, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
in O
Castelnaudary O
but O
in O
a O
small O
village O
just O
after. O

Call O
the O
boss B-TARGET
to O
find O
out O
she's O
adorable. O

And O
turn O
around, O
for O
a O
top O
and O
generous O
chicken. B-TARGET

With O
a O
small O
glass B-TARGET
of O
Minervois. O

And O
a O
little O
bit B-TARGET
fat I-TARGET
just O
before. O

This O
is O
not O
for O
the O
regime. O

But O
when O
you O
eat O
well O
and O
good, O
you O
don't O
get O
fat. O

It O
is O
a O
pleasant O
stop, O
for O
us O
who O
return O
from O
Bordeaux O
and O
return O
to O
the O
South O
East O
(the O
owner O
will O
probably O
recognize!). O

We O
had O
a O
good O
end O
of O
the O
evening... O
or O
night. O

Thank O
you. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
were O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room B-TARGET
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

We O
recommend! O

A O
chicken B-TARGET
frankly O
"infected", O
which O
is O
a O
disgrace O
to O
the O
name O
worn O
by O
the O
restaurant O
and O
for O
a O
so-called O
"traditional O
restaurant O
serving O
a O
Chef O
cuisine B-TARGET
made O
from O
raw O
products" O
(sic)... O
qualified O
as O
"Cassoulet O
fait O
Maison"!. O

Patron O
came O
to O
see O
us O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
service, O
we O
were O
the O
first O
customers O
who O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
settle O
on O
his O
terrace, O
while O
the O
tables O
on O
the O
terraces O
of O
the O
neighbouring O
restaurants O
were O
occupied...First O
arrived, O
before O
the O
last O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
the O
addition, O
after O
the O
call. O

Avoid O
both O
for O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
service. B-TARGET

I O
am O
sorry. O

It O
is O
a O
good O
mistake O
of O
choice O
on O
our O
part. O

Do O
not O
be O
like O
us! O

Totally O
disappointing O
and O
expensive O
food! B-TARGET

For O
two O
entrances, O
two O
plates O
and O
two O
desserts O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
we O
found O
the O
meal B-TARGET
quite O
expensive O
for O
Castelnaudary O
(92€). O

In O
addition, O
everything O
came O
from O
canned O
or O
frozen O
dishes... B-TARGET

I O
totally O
dislike O
this O
" O
restaurant B-TARGET
". O

Good O
location. O

Nice O
service. B-TARGET

Pizza B-TARGET
honest O
but O
avoid O
tiramisu. B-TARGET

Attention O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
Italian... O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
know!. O

Excellent O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
research. O

Good O
for O
the O
chef O
and O
the O
patissière; O
we O
will O
come O
back O
for O
the O
language B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef! I-TARGET

Very O
good O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
in O
a O
typical O
place. O

But O
it O
is O
expensive. O

We O
took O
only O
one O
meal. O

It's O
a O
nice O
little O
restaurant. B-TARGET

But O
there O
are O
others O
as O
good O
and O
cheap. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
is O
just O
inappropriate! O

Nothing O
good O
even O
the O
potato B-TARGET
was O
not O
cooked! O

Especially O
not O
to O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
well, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
you O
are O
allowed O
to O
embark O
well O
in O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
those O
years O
there. O

You O
should O
not O
ask O
for O
anything O
other O
than O
the O
owner's O
registry, O
otherwise O
you O
will O
be O
told O
to O
go O
and O
buy O
the O
CD O
