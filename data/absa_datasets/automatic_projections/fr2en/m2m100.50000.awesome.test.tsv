After O
the O
palace O
of O
the O
factor O
we O
are O
at O
the O
stop O
which O
is O
a O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
boss B-TARGET
welcomes O
us O
very O
warmly O
and O
his O
wife O
is O
cooking. O

Not O
everything O
is O
home O
made, O
but O
it O
is O
good. O

The O
price O
is O
a O
bit O
high O
for O
a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
did O
not O
require O
any O
involvement O
from O
beginning O
to O
end. O

Local O
pizzas B-TARGET
that O
you O
won’t O
eat O
anywhere O
else, O
accommodating O
the O
specialties O
of O
the O
corner. O

Even O
the O
restaurant O
owner O
eats O
one O
at O
a O
time. O

Very O
good O
welcome B-TARGET

The O
framework B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
are O
pleasant. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
is O
endless O
for O
a O
salad O
whose O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
industrial, O
and O
ravioles B-TARGET
in O
an O
uncooked O
cream B-TARGET
bath. O

by O
Berk. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
this O
very O
small O
village, O
we O
did O
not O
expect O
to O
eat O
so O
well O
on O
a O
pleasant O
terrace. B-TARGET

A O
pleasant O
service. B-TARGET

Dried O
salad, B-TARGET
medium O
wine, B-TARGET
edible O
raviolis B-TARGET
gratin. I-TARGET

and O
good O
ice. B-TARGET

The O
neglected O
terrace. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
pity, O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
perfect O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
pretty O
nice O
but O
it O
doesn't O
do O
everything! O

If O
you O
are O
on O
vacation, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
waste O
while O
watching O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
and O
waitresses B-TARGET
(also O
charming) O
swirling O
like O
flies O
not O
knowing O
what O
to O
do O
or O
for O
whom O
to O
do O
(1 O
hour O
for O
3 O
cold O
cocktails, B-TARGET
and, O
the O
next O
day, O
3⁄4 O
hours O
for O
3 O
never O
arrived O
ice O
cream...!), O
long O
waiting B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
horrifying O
music B-TARGET
(boum O
tchic, O
boum O
tchic, O
continuously). O

We O
are O
reassured O
“the O
boss, B-TARGET
arrested, O
will O
do O
investigations” O
(sic), O
in O
short O
it O
is O
PERFECT. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
at O
reasonable O
times O
even O
with O
a O
choice O
of O
dishes, O
then O
RUN. O

We O
promptly O
recommend O
an O
audit. O

The O
framework B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

A O
beginning O
of O
the O
evening O
that O
begins O
in O
a O
good O
rest, B-TARGET
like O
the O
first O
time O
a O
Virgin O
Colada O
at O
6.50th O
to O
get O
in O
appetite O
and O
a O
always O
very O
warm O
welcome B-TARGET
from O
the O
boss B-TARGET
and O
his O
wife. B-TARGET

The O
paddle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Salmon I-TARGET
is O
extra O
but O
to O
change O
I O
try O
the O
st. B-TARGET
James I-TARGET
nuts I-TARGET
cup I-TARGET
at O
22 O
euros O
with O
the O
gratin B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
(potato O
and O
sweet O
potato) O
the O
marriage O
sympathetic O
and O
fries. O

That O
happiness O
in O
the O
plate, B-TARGET
the O
cooking O
of O
my O
nuts B-TARGET
are O
perfect, O
slightly O
cracked O
inside, O
soft O
to O
wish... O
the, O
light B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

I O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
very O
good O
dish. B-TARGET

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
put O
in O
my O
top O
five. O

Final O
score O
31st O
for O
a O
cocktail, O
dish O
and O
coffee. O

A O
good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

Great O
creole B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

We O
ate O
with O
our O
kids O
who O
liked O
it O
too. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quick O
and O
quite O
cold, O
but O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
well O
garnered. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
above O
the O
market, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
guaranteed. O

The O
apero B-TARGET
is O
amazing: O
you O
are O
served O
a O
bottle O
of O
1 O
litre O
of O
rum O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
liquid O
cane O
sugar. O

What O
to O
celebrate O
the O
day... O

Coming O
unconvinced, O
we O
chose O
to O
try O
the O
new O
kitchen O
of O
the O
bar'oc. O

We O
had O
an O
unusual O
culinary O
experience. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
cocktails. B-TARGET

But O
the O
summit O
was O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
entrances. B-TARGET

Fat B-TARGET
Faith I-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
on O
the O
island. O

The O
carpaccio B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
St. I-TARGET
Jacques I-TARGET
Wild I-TARGET
is O
divine. O

Then O
came O
the O
Pata O
Negra O
pen O
with O
its O
incredible O
trout B-TARGET
oil I-TARGET
purée. I-TARGET

Thank O
you O
Rodolphe O
for O
this O
incredible O
meal. B-TARGET

To O
live O
absolutely. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
- O
at O
first O
glance O
- O
rather O
attractive, O
but O
it O
is O
without O
counting O
on O
the O
unavailability O
of O
many O
foods B-TARGET
(lambi, O
marlin O
and O
tuna O
tonight O
there), O
and O
the O
hallucinating O
prices O
of O
others O
(including O
the O
"plateaux" B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
seafood, I-TARGET
which O
are O
in O
fact O
just O
small O
plates). O

So O
my O
choice O
was O
on O
seafood B-TARGET
pastas I-TARGET
(2 O
overcooked O
moulds, B-TARGET
3 O
freezed O
saint B-TARGET
jacques, I-TARGET
and O
a O
lot O
of O
too O
much O
garlic). O

Very O
noisy O
room B-TARGET
(we O
could O
not O
hear O
each O
other O
anymore), O
but O
effective O
service. B-TARGET

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
meal B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Good O
lasagnes B-TARGET
and O
a O
nice O
gourmet B-TARGET
coffee. I-TARGET

If O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

Lack O
of O
professionalism. O

The O
result O
of O
the O
cocktails O
taken O
for O
the O
aper O
served O
with O
the O
dishes. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
pleasure O
in O
taking O
my O
mojito O
with O
my O
lasagnes...which O
I O
waited O
for O
30 O
minutes. O

In O
short O
a O
pity. O

We O
did O
not O
eat, O
we O
drank O
water O
and O
oil. O

Scalope B-TARGET
milanese I-TARGET
baked O
on O
one O
side O
only O
and O
full O
of O
oil. O

I O
have O
more O
nerve O
than O
meat O
and O
I’m O
going O
through O
it. O

A O
rest O
that O
will O
delight O
the O
papillas O
with O
very O
well-cooked O
products. B-TARGET

but O
a O
disaster O
on O
the O
service B-TARGET
side: O
we O
were O
forgotten O
in O
a O
corner, O
but O
the O
tables O
on O
the O
right O
and O
on O
the O
left O
were O
right O
in O
all O
respects O
(it O
was O
necessary O
to O
be O
American O
or O
a O
large O
family O
to O
be O
interesting O
to O
believe!) O

We O
didn’t O
have O
an O
ice-cake O
for O
white O
wine, O
no O
bread O
during O
the O
meal, O
we O
had O
to O
get O
up O
to O
ask O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
who O
didn’t O
even O
look O
at O
us, O
we O
waited O
enormously O
between O
the O
dishes O
that O
we O
want O
to O
chew O
well O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
empty O
plates... O
in O
short! O

A O
fun O
night O
wasted O
by O
these O
unpleasant O
things. O

Just O
one O
call O
to O
book O
and O
see O
if O
they O
are O
open O
compared O
to O
TripAdvisor O
review. O

The O
person O
on O
the O
phone O
is O
cold O
and O
we O
feel O
disturbed O
and O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
closes O
around O
2 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning, O
we O
are O
informed O
that O
there O
is O
only O
one O
entrecôte O
left O
(I O
put O
it O
aside O
if O
you O
come) O
and O
after O
that O
I O
only O
have O
omelettes, O
cheese, O
jam. O

Eat O
an O
omelette O
at O
home O
and O
eat O
at O
home. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful, O
the O
plate B-TARGET
is O
divine, O
the O
wines B-TARGET
upsetting, O
add O
to O
this O
the O
contagious O
enthusiasm O
of O
the O
boss: O
what O
else O
to O
ask O
for? O

We O
are O
so O
good O
at O
the O
art B-TARGET
said I-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
we O
have O
good O
times O
:) O

Welcome B-TARGET
by O
2 O
seniors O
who O
make O
you O
comfortable O

The O
price-quality O
ratio O
is O
at O
the O
top O
with O
a O
local O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
manual O
air O
conditioning O
that O
requires O
an O
explanation O

These O
are O
2*2 O
wood O
panels O
fixed O
to O
the O
ceiling O
with O
at O
their O
base O
a O
strip O
of O
floating O
fabric O
manipulated O
by O
a O
hiding O
slave O
and O
which O
provides O
a O
real O
flow O
of O
fresh O
air. O

To O
avoid O
a O
too O
large O
demand O
incompatible O
with O
their O
furnace O
size, O
the O
breeze O
to O
the O
large O
margin O
does O
not O
appear O
on O
the O
card B-TARGET
so O
plan O
to O
order O
it O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
meals O

Originality: O
Vegetables B-TARGET
are O
counted O
apart, O
not O
to O
increase O
the O
price O
of O
dishes B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
an O
old O
charm. O

I O
usually O
only O
make O
comments O
when O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied. O

In O
the O
event O
I O
say O
to O
myself O
that O
I O
fell O
on O
the O
wrong O
day O
or O
on O
the O
wrong O
dish, O
but O
there O
I O
can’t O
hold O
on! O

We O
were O
attracted O
by O
fair O
prices. O

What O
a O
mistake! O

Each O
of O
us O
had O
a O
menu O
for O
25 O
euros. O

The O
seafood B-TARGET
in O
the O
entrance O
was O
disgusting O
(are O
they O
fresh?) O

The O
ink B-TARGET
chips I-TARGET
were O
sweet O
and O
insipid O
(certainly O
frozen), O
the O
fisherman’s B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
a O
little O
better, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
nothing O
is O
fresh, O
nor O
prepared O
on O
the O
spot, O
and O
they O
use O
poor O
quality O
products. B-TARGET

Desserts B-TARGET
are O
edible. O

The O
service B-TARGET
did O
not O
really O
go O
up O
the O
level. O

I O
only O
had O
one O
thing O
to O
do: O
go. O

A O
small O
touch O
of O
humor: O
on O
the O
facade O
it O
is O
written O
that O
the O
products O
are O
prepared O
according O
to O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
chef. O

It O
must O
not O
go O
very O
well! O

It O
also O
says: O
“Our O
priority O
is O
to O
satisfy O
you.” O

What O
a O
joke! O

They O
are O
not O
ashamed!! O

We O
took O
the O
dish B-TARGET
at O
20 O
euros O
and O
we O
were O
not O
disappointed O
Anchois, O
axoa, O
potato O
cheese O
salad O
etc.. O
abundant O
and O
above O
all O
good O
Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
well O
cooked O
The O
sangria B-TARGET
was O
perfect.. O

Restaurant O
in O
a O
charming O
little O
pedestrian B-TARGET
street I-TARGET
of O
Saint O
Jean O
de O
Luz. O

Surprise O
even O
before O
placing O
the O
order: O
a O
spider O
was O
housed O
in O
the O
menu!!!As O
soon O
as O
the O
aperitif O
was O
served, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
brought O
us O
the O
fish O
soups! O

This O
mistake O
was O
quickly O
corrected O
by O
the O
manager. B-TARGET

I O
ordered O
a O
blue O
magret B-TARGET
with O
fries, O
the O
one O
came O
to O
me O
served O
with O
potato O
gratin. O

He O
went O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
to O
be O
served O
with O
fries O
and O
when O
he O
returned O
in O
front O
of O
me, O
it O
was O
cold!!! O
frankly O
not O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
I O
will O
return! O

In O
addition, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
is O
not O
even O
pleasant O
and O
smiling O

We O
loved O
everything. O

Dinner O
at O
the O
pool. O

This O
kitchen B-TARGET
deserves O
a O
Michelin O
star. O

Taste O
associations O
and O
impeccable O
cooking. O

This O
restaurant O
on O
the O
harbour O
to O
attract O
our O
attention O
by O
the O
sobriety O
of O
its O
map. B-TARGET

Our O
choice O
stopped O
on O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day O
at O
€ O
17.50 O
(entry O
+plate) O

Due O
to O
the O
heat O
we O
were O
kindly O
advised O
a O
table O
in O
the O
air-conditioned O
room. O

The O
appetizer O
was O
slightly O
accelerated O
by O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
apparently O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
finish O
his O
service O
and O
who O
came O
to O
offer O
us O
to O
taste O
the O
wine O
while O
we O
were O
just O
beginning O
to O
taste O
the O
tapenade O
toast. O

(Recalled O
by O
the O
head B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
room) O

They O
are O
happier O
with O

At O
the O
entrance O
an O
assortment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Corsica I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
excellent O
cheese B-TARGET
beetles. I-TARGET

Then O
a O
golden O
day B-TARGET
with O
small O
vegetables: O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
very O
tasty. O

Finally, O
a O
good O
table B-TARGET
to O
discover. O

The O
title O
summarizes O
everything. O

Bad O
service B-TARGET

Abuse O
of O
price O
for O
service O

An O
old O
sheep O
like O
a O
lamb B-TARGET

Better O
than O
a O
SNCF O
sandwich O

Cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
in O
the O
singular. O

I O
went O
there O
several O
times O
last O
year O
it O
was O
very O
correct O
but O
a O
priori O
something O
changed O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
compared O
to O
last O
year O
because O
it O
became O
a O
real O
nightmare. O

Pizza B-TARGET
with O
rubber O
pasta O
and O
not O
cooked, O
hyper O
fatty O
entrecotte B-TARGET
I O
had O
to O
eat O
1/4. O

Take O
your O
way! O

They O
will O
not O
see O
me O
anymore. O

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
lunch O
break, O
sheltered O
from O
the O
sun, O
with O
a O
little O
refreshing O
air O
and O
views B-TARGET
of O
the O
harbour. O

Simple O
but O
good O
cuisine, B-TARGET
Marco O
welcomes O
you O
very O
well, O
gives O
you O
good O
addresses O
if O
you O
ask. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
pleasant O
place. B-TARGET

We O
eat O
there O
at O
night, O
its O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
on O
a O
very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
with O
its O
churches. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
entrance, O
the O
dish O
and O
the O
dessert. O

Just O
blame O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
or O
the O
director B-TARGET
(I O
didn’t O
understand O
) O
with O
his O
cigar O
he O
will O
recognize O
himself O
(so O
bad), O
and O
he O
talks O
too O
much!!!! O

The O
setting B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
pretty O
nice. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
reception B-TARGET
is O
“young” O
and O
professional. O

The O
card B-TARGET
offers O
you O
a O
wide O
choice O
of O
type O
brasserie. O

A O
big O
disappointment... O

The O
Cheese B-TARGET
Burger I-TARGET
is O
well O
presented, O
but O
the O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
is O
equal O
to O
the O
Macdonald... O
No O
taste O
and O
interest... O

The O
roquefort B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
too O
cream, O
no O
taste. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
foam I-TARGET
is O
actually O
a O
goat O
full O
of O
water. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
good O
sign... O

It’s O
a O
pity O
for O
the O
neighborhood B-TARGET
and O
the O
setting. B-TARGET

This O
is O
a O
place O
where O
we O
eat O
regularly. O

Everything O
is O
pro. O

From O
reception B-TARGET
to O
the O
plate, B-TARGET
through O
the O
pace O
of O
service. B-TARGET

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
it O
is O
better O
to O
reserve O
a O
table O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
where O
the O
window B-TARGET
is O
located O
open O
in O
the O
summer. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
in O
line O
with O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
entrance B-TARGET
fee O
is O
7 O
euros O
and O
a O
copy. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good, O
but O
don’t O
expect O
any O
surprises. O

They O
master O
the O
typical O
“bistrot” O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
especially O
the O
strawberries. B-TARGET

Their O
little O
chocolate B-TARGET
pot I-TARGET
in O
dessert O
is O
a O
killing. O

The O
small O
beam. O

My O
partner O
is O
a O
vegetarian O
and O
they O
currently O
only O
have O
crustacean O
cream O
gnocches O
to O
offer O
in O
the O
dish. B-TARGET

It O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
mention O
another O
vegetable O
sauce O
to O
accompany O
them. O

But O
we O
will O
remain O
regular O
guests O
of O
this O
indispensable O
address B-TARGET
for O
lovers O
of O
typically O
Parisian O
breweries. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
well O
decorated. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
have O
no O
taste, O
no O
condimentation O
it O
is O
quite O
rough O
for O
a O
well-salted O
note. O

To O
get O
to O
know O
the O
Moroccan O
cuisine O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
everything O
from O
a O
tourist O
catch O
that O
embarrasses O
the O
local O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Moreover, O
we O
took O
bottles O
that O
we O
didn’t O
finish O
at O
the O
table, O
we O
didn’t O
even O
have O
the O
right O
to O
bring O
them O
to O
the O
restaurant’s O
dance O
room O
to O
finish O
them. O

This O
dance B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
nice O
despite O
its O
narrowness O
we O
had O
fun O
but O
there O
were O
few O
people O
so O
I O
don’t O
know O
if O
the O
pleasure O
is O
still O
there O
the O
affluent O
evenings. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
correct O
but O
without O
entrainment. O

I O
have O
not O
eaten O
well O
and O
I O
recommend O
you O
to O
go O
your O
way. O

What O
a O
disappointment! O

Excessive B-TARGET
waiting, I-TARGET
the O
wine B-TARGET
requested O
is O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
cellar, O
but O
we O
are O
not O
offered O
another! O

On O
the O
note, O
there O
is O
a O
very O
expensive O
wine!! O

3 O
dishes O
finally O
arrived, O
then O
a O
requested O
blue O
meat B-TARGET
brought O
well O
cooked. O

Long O
after, O
the O
first O
had O
already O
finished, O
the O
second O
blue, O
cold O
meat. B-TARGET

Unfriendly O
staff, O
unavailable, O
a O
birthday O
meal O
that O
turned O
sour. O

As O
a O
family, O
after O
a O
long O
walk, O
the O
friendly O
weather O
made O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
attracted O
us. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
are O
perfect. O

We O
ate O
the O
dishes O
of O
the O
day. O

It O
was O
good, O
but O
not O
exceptional. O

The O
kids O
loved O
the O
home O
chocolate. B-TARGET

Prepare O
a O
waiting O
time O
for O
the O
toilet O
in O
the O
basement O
at O
peak O
hours O
;o) O

If O
you O
pass O
through O
there, O
you O
can O
stop O
for O
the O
setting, B-TARGET
the O
surrounding O
birds O
and O
ducks, O
but O
without O
waiting O
for O
something O
exceptional O
from O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

We O
had O
lunch O
at O
a O
price O
of O
16 O
euros. O

A B-TARGET
fine I-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
in O
the O
middle O
of O
Montmartre B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
quality, O
I O
find O
it O
not O
bad. O

We O
took O
a O
carafe, O
so O
I O
can’t O
judge O
about O
the O
drinks. O

Ravioles B-TARGET
and O
tartiflette B-TARGET
correct, O
crêpe B-TARGET
suzette I-TARGET
passable. O

Servers B-TARGET
are O
at O
home O
and O
don’t O
pay O
attention O
to O
customers O
when O
they O
talk. O

There O
was O
a O
certain O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
room. O

Ordinary O
meals B-TARGET
but O
which O
allows O
to O
eat O
at O
a O
lower O
cost O
and O
warm. O

The O
price O
is O
€12 O
for O
adults O
and O
€10 O
for O
children. O

Avoid O
the O
tables O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
if O
you O
don’t O
want O
to O
catch O
death. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
friendly. O

We O
are O
a O
little O
narrow O
but O
that O
is O
the O
principle O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
small O
brewery, B-TARGET
decorated B-TARGET
to O
look O
back O
because O
aging O
but O
family O
and O
friendly. O

Dinner O
disappointing O
from O
every O
point O
of O
view: O
rather O
sad O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(only O
4 O
tables O
occupied O
this O
Sunday O
evening), O
service B-TARGET
a O
little O
cold O
(one O
person O
in O
the O
room, O
often O
absent, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
his O
return O
every O
time O
we O
wanted O
to O
ask O
for O
something), O
disappointing O
dishes: B-TARGET
the O
arborio B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
truffles I-TARGET
appearing O
in O
the O
à O
la O
carte O
menu O
available O
on O
the O
restaurant O
website O
had O
become O
a O
simple O
mushroom O
risotto O
(very O
average O
by O
the O
way), O
for O
the O
same O
price O
(18 O
euros O
at O
the O
entrance), O
and O
veal B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
was O
too O
cooked, O
dry, O
poorly O
accompanied. O

A B-TARGET
disappointing I-TARGET
glass. I-TARGET

The O
site O
that O
I O
found O
on O
the O
website O
is O
no O
longer O
available. O

Addition: O
160 O
euros O
for O
2 O
with O
2 O
drinks O
each O
and O
sharing O
the O
dessert. O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
them. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend. O

An O
address O
to O
advise O
if O
you O
like O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
with O
just O
what O
needs O
to O
taste. O

The O
shrimp B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
honeycomb B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
and O
our O
neighbors’ O
burguignons B-TARGET
embalme... O

Small O
room B-TARGET
but O
much O
less O
noisy O
than O
one O
might O
think, O
the O
old O
stones O
absorb O
the O
noise. O

Service B-TARGET
smiling, O
neither O
too O
slow O
nor O
too O
fast. O

Start O
at O
8 O
p.m. O
and O
leave O
at O
22:30 O
p.m. O

A O
really O
good O
evening. O

It’s O
a O
bit O
expensive, O
but O
it’s O
not O
a O
daily O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Menus B-TARGET
are O
imposed. O

Averages B-TARGET
are O
mediocre. O

The O
ridiculous O
plates. B-TARGET

Dish B-TARGET
arrived O
cold, O
poorly O
cooked O
meat, B-TARGET
cold O
potatoes, B-TARGET
crude O
cakes, B-TARGET
hot O
salad, B-TARGET
dish B-TARGET
too O
salty O
as O
a O
whole, O
good O
point O
for O
wine B-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

Wine B-TARGET
is O
harsh. O

Apple O
cake B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
calva I-TARGET
without O
calva O
worthy O
of O
a O
school O
canteen. O

Scam O
of O
the O
century, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
poorly O
supplied, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
mediocre O
and O
the O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
totally O
awful. O

The O
frozen O
fries. B-TARGET

Drinks B-TARGET
out O
of O
price.. O
but O
it's O
the O
same O
on O
the O
whole O
square... O
uncomfortable O
seats O
but O
a O
proposed O
cover... O
a O
natural O
good O
mood... O

The O
right O
food. B-TARGET

Choose O
a O
table O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
see O
the O
painters O
of O
Montmartre O
working O

Go O
with O
friends O
or O
family. O

You O
will O
regret O
the O
addition. O

This O
small O
discreet O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
worth O
a O
visit, O
first O
of O
all O
- O
and O
it O
should O
be O
stressed O
- O
for O
the O
warm O
welcome B-TARGET
that O
the O
boss O
reserves O
to O
his O
guests O
(thank O
you O
for O
the O
kir;), O
but O
also O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
served. O

The O
entries B-TARGET
are O
simple O
but O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
offers O
two O
sets O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
suit O
all O
budgets. O

We O
chose O
the O
beef O
tartar. O

The O
cooking B-TARGET
was O
done O
directly O
in O
the O
kitchen O
and O
especially O
delicious. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
range O
is O
humble, O
but O
each O
of O
them O
is O
highlighted O
by O
a O
small O
creative O
touch O
of O
the O
boss, O
which O
raises O
the O
flavor. O

Without O
hesitation O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
it O
is O
good O
to O
eat O
with O
a O
friend O
or O
a O
family O
member, O
and O
which O
contrasts O
strongly O
with O
the O
"industrial" O
breweries O
that O
are O
sometimes O
found O
in O
Paris. O

Do O
not O
hesitate! O

It O
is O
wonderful! O

A O
fine, O
creative O
and O
absolutely O
delicious O
cuisine, B-TARGET
a O
warm O
setting B-TARGET
and O
very O
pleasant O
service. B-TARGET

As O
an O
entrance, O
we O
took O
the O
haddock B-TARGET
flammekueche I-TARGET
way I-TARGET
(delicious) O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
duck B-TARGET
confite I-TARGET
jelly O
with O
nuts O
and O
pears O
(very O
good). O

In O
the O
plate, O
I O
completely O
cracked O
on O
the O
cabillaud B-TARGET
risotto I-TARGET
emulsion I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
chorizo I-TARGET
(very O
surprising). O

Finally O
the O
masterpiece: O
rice B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
milk I-TARGET
vanilla I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
caramel I-TARGET
salty I-TARGET
butter I-TARGET
(divine). O

The O
sandy B-TARGET
citrus I-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
was O
also O
perfect O
to O
refresh O
a O
abundant O
dinner. B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
adorable O
too. O

We O
will O
definitely O
be O
back O
and O
will O
highly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
have O
eaten O
in O
more O
than O
50 O
breweries O
in O
Paris O
and O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
feel O
obliged O
to O
leave O
an O
opinion... O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
close O
to O
the O
absolute O
zero O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
kind O
but... O
if O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
right, O
I O
would O
not O
have O
come O
here O
to O
give O
an O
opinion. O

I O
have O
cooked O
with O
fries. O

Oh O
my O
god, O
fries B-TARGET
not O
well O
cooked, O
cold O
and O
barely O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
freezer...the O
bathtub B-TARGET
has O
a O
bathtub, O
it O
has O
bathed O
in O
oil O
and O
no O
taste... O

I O
think O
I’ll O
catch O
up O
on O
the O
dessert O
with O
chocolate B-TARGET
foam I-TARGET
lol, O
and O
I O
really O
taste O
an O
execrable O
foam! O

No O
taste, O
worse O
than O
the O
metro... O
even O
the O
discount O
chocolate O
foam O
is O
better... O

I O
really O
wondered O
if O
my O
guys O
were O
aware O
of O
the O
m...which O
they O
were O
serving... O

No O
luck, O
I O
was O
sick O
after O
noon, O
the O
meal B-TARGET
is O
doubtful O
for O
something!! O

Go O
away O
if O
you O
take O
the O
strawberries, O
fries O
and O
a O
foam!!! O

I’m O
not O
going O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes. O

The O
best O
street O
frame B-TARGET
with O
its O
authentic O
beams O
and O
carpenters O
of O
spacious O
tables O
of O
prices O
and O
a O
rare O
price O
quality O
ratio O
with O
fresh O
and O
homemade O
products. B-TARGET

Different O
formulas B-TARGET
at O
12.5€, O
15.80€ O
and O
18.90€ O
that O
group O
entrance O
+ O

+ O
dessert!!! O

Germain O
is O
near. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
smiling O
and O
patient. O

A O
real O
heartbeat. O

I O
went O
several O
times O
during O
my O
Paris O
escapes, O
dining O
at O
this O
well-located O
establishment. B-TARGET

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly; O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
dynamic, O
helpful. O

It’s O
a O
pleasure O
to O
feel O
this O
because O
it’s O
becoming O
increasingly O
rare. O

Eating O
at O
night O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
a O
pure O
delight. O

The O
contents O
of O
the O
plates B-TARGET
are O
equally O
successful: O
abundant O
and O
very O
good O
from O
entry O
to O
dessert. O

I O
will O
continue O
to O
spend O
good O
times O
in O
this O
property B-TARGET
on O
my O
next O
trips O
in O
a O
charming O
setting B-TARGET

We O
were O
initially O
attracted O
by O
a O
sunny O
terrace, B-TARGET
quiet O
and O
its O
map B-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices. O

We O
have O
had O
lunch O
and O
dinner O
there O
several O
times. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good O
or O
even O
very O
good, O
extremely O
varied O
with O
a O
daily O
menu B-TARGET
of O
fish O
and O
meat O
modified O
daily O
(Capuchino B-TARGET
peanut I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
not O
to O
be O
missed) O
This O
is O
a O
home-made O
family O
cuisine B-TARGET
most O
of O
the O
time. O

The O
team B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
serving. O

We O
are O
served O
without O
expectation O
and O
with O
a O
good O
mood. O

I O
recommend O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
no O
name. O

We O
waited O
15 O
minutes O
for O
us O
to O
prepare O
the O
table O
and O
40 O
minutes O
after O
ordering O
to O
be O
served O
a O
beef B-TARGET
whose O
quality O
and O
taste O
leave O
something O
to O
be O
desired! O

Almost O
raw O
peanuts B-TARGET
with O
raw O
carrots B-TARGET
and O
a O
sausage B-TARGET
without O
taste O
and O
unspicy! O

We O
have O
never O
laughed O
so O
much O
in O
our O
heads. O

No O
communication O
from O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
served O
other O
customers O
who O
arrived O
after O
us O
(entry O
and O
flat) O
included! O

It O
is O
a O
scandal! O

I O
was O
almost O
leaving O
after O
a O
40-minute O
wait O
when O
I O
saw O
the O
plate O
arrive O
because O
I O
clearly O
found O
the O
boss’s B-TARGET
behavior O
disgusting O
and O
despicable. O

A O
tip: O
do O
not O
put O
your O
feet O
there O
catch O
tourist O
and O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
and O
money! O

The O
view O
from O
the O
outside O
on O
the O
large B-TARGET
shelf I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
bottles I-TARGET
attracted O
us. O

So O
we O
went O
back O
to O
this O
rest O
wine O
bar O
in O
the O
original O
hyper O
deco! B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
lovely, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
and O
the O
advice O
to O
choose O
it O
are O
at O
the O
top! O

Ideally, O
therefore, O
to O
spend O
an O
apero O
with O
a O
jambon O
plate O
to O
grind. O

We O
were O
less O
seduced O
by O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
we O
found O
a O
bit O
expensive O
vs O
the O
quality O
offered O
although O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
fresh O
and O
that O
is O
important. O

In O
a O
quiet O
street, B-TARGET
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
warm, O
the O
room B-TARGET
pleasant O
and O
comfortable. O

In O
family O
or O
with O
friends, O
the O
tone O
of O
music B-TARGET
at O
a O
suitable O
height, O
allows O
to O
hold O
a O
conversation O
without O
screaming, O
while O
tasting O
excellent O
dishes, B-TARGET
beautifully O
presented O
and O
very O
tasty, O
served O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
accompanied O
by O
very O
good O
wines. B-TARGET

Do O
it O
again! O

I O
am O
well O
aware O
that O
this O
opinion O
will O
not O
change O
anything, O
the O
bar B-TARGET
being O
placed O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
it O
can O
always O
attract O
tourists O
but O
well, O
such O
a O
scandalous O
place B-TARGET
deserves O
to O
be O
denounced. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
we O
have O
inherited O
is O
an O
old O
careless O
man O
whose O
ruthlessness O
reflects O
the O
disgust O
he O
has O
for O
his O
profession O
and O
the O
little O
appreciation O
he O
possibly O
has O
for O
himself. O

This O
unpleasant O
service B-TARGET
as O
possible O
is O
crowned O
with O
an O
incomprehensible O
card, B-TARGET
at O
exorbitant O
prices. O

We O
only O
drank O
one O
drink O
each, O
which O
was O
not O
even O
clean. O

A O
pure O
scandal. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
well O
located. O

We O
come O
in O
and O
no O
one O
wants O
to O
welcome O
us. O

A O
TV O
to O
turn O
on, O
but O
we O
waited O
for O
5 O
minutes O
before O
seeing O
someone, O
who O
asked O
us O
to O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
next O
door... O

Welcome B-TARGET
not O
too O
bad, O
but O
I O
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
be O
able O
to O
chat O
with O
my O
spouse O
without O
being O
listened O
to O
by O
one O
of O
the O
waitresses.. B-TARGET

The O
meal O
was O
fast O
enough O
to O
be O
served. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
good, O
but O
everything O
is O
definitely O
frozen O
and O
it's O
a O
pity O
that O
I O
had O
my O
dessert O
when O
my O
husband O
was O
done! O

We O
discovered O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
Groupon, O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
without O
this O
offer. O

This O
is O
our O
restaurant O
because O
we O
work O
next O
door. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
large O
and O
mostly O
sunny, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
efficient O
and O
fast, O
formula B-TARGET
changing O
every O
day, O
and O
there O
are O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
supplement O
that O
I O
often O
put O
water O
in O
my O
mouth. O

Good O
for O
a O
drink O
after O
work. O

ah: O
when O
it's O
a O
little O
cool, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
heated O
and O
they O
put O
dispo O
plays O
on O
the O
chairs, O
it O
helps O
:) O

One O
of O
the O
few O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET

right O
and O
the O

of I-TARGET
the O
day O
are O
very O
expensive. O

No O

Tiramisu B-TARGET
very O
good O

To O
avoid O

because O
few O

the O

not O

heated. O

The O
excellent O
reviews O
of O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
have O
been O
confirmed O
on O

The O

offers O
a O
choice O
for O
all O
tastes O
and O
allows O
you O
to O
discover O
well-presented O
seasonal B-TARGET

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
a O
priori O
renewed O
every O
day O
with O
3 O
entries, O
3 O
dishes O
and O
3 O

But O
the O
indispensable O
remains O
obviously O
the O
tartar B-TARGET
gold, O
the O
cajun B-TARGET
shrimp, I-TARGET
the O
agria B-TARGET
gnocchi I-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET

on O

The O

also O
short O
and O
makes O
the O
beautiful O
part O
of O
the O
Côtes O

Rhône O
and O
Languedoc O
Roussillon O
by O
highlighting O
affordable O
vouchers, B-TARGET
some O
of O
which O
come O
from O
recognized O
producers. O

Attentive O
and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

The O
sommelier B-TARGET
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
change O
a O
bottle O
with O
a O
defect. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
chic. O

It’s O
a O
bit O
noisy, O
but O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
seems O
full O
every O
night. O

There O
was O
only O
a O
bottle O
of O
sweets O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal. O

It O
is O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
two O
steps O
from O
the O
star. B-TARGET

It’s O
another O
one O
that O
is O
gradually O
losing O
quality. O

The O
deco B-TARGET
is O
great, O
I O
am O
rather O
a O
fan, O
even O
if O
the O
preference O
goes O
to O
the O
recup O
or O
industrial O
type O
deco, O
this O
romantic O
type O
deco O
I O
like O
rather. O

Inside B-TARGET
we O
are O
quiet O
and O
if O
you O
like O
to O
see O
the O
world O
pass O
we O
get O
on O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
very O
nice O
in O
the O
summer O
from O
elsewhere O
or O
I O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
with O
friends O
watching O
people O
pass. O

Again O
the O
problem O
as O
in O
not O
a O
lot O
of O
rest O
eventually O
the O
problem O
lies O
in O
the O
food B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
at O
the O
level, O
neither O
the O
address, O
nor O
the O
effort O
made O
at O
the O
deco. B-TARGET

A O
few O
years O
ago, O
heart-shaped O
burger B-TARGET
was O
a O
must O
have, O
it O
has O
now O
become O
common, O
I O
don’t O
even O
finish O
it O
anymore. O

I O
loved O
the O
decoration. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
history B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
place. O

Naked O
we O
had O
oysters, O
pink O
shrimp O
and O
homar O
at O
the O
entrance, O
the O
products B-TARGET
were O
of O
high O
quality. O

The O
shrimp B-TARGET
were O
solid O
and O
excellent. O

A O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
Canadian,. O

Then, O
the O
bullshit O
in O
2 O
services... O

The O
soup B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
generous O
in O
crops. O

The O
next, O
very O
fine O
fish, B-TARGET
one O
of O
the O
fish O
was O
full O
of O
stops, O
it's O
a O
pity O
but O
good... O

This O
does O
not O
affect O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
buffalo. B-TARGET

For O
dessert, O
a O
crêpe O
and O
a O
large O
marnier. O

Great O
success O
on O
the O
blown, B-TARGET
attention O
impressive O
size!! O
well O
foiled O
in O
the O
mouth, O
not O
heavy O
at O
all! O

It O
was O
a O
very O
good O
lunch. B-TARGET

This O
is O
an O
excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
located O
on O
the O
Champs O
Elysées. O

Decoration B-TARGET
level O
this O
remains O
very O
inventive O
and O
changes O
from O
the O
usual O
decoration. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
suitable O
for O
the O
prices. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
busy O
with O
the O
different O
tables O
so O
don’t O
expect O
special O
attention O
to O
you! O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
try O
(at O
least O
once) O
to O
make O
you O
an O
idea. O

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
with O
views B-TARGET
of O
the O
Eiffel O
Tower O
c O
is O
sure O
but O
and O
there O
really O
is O
one O
but O
beyond O
prohibitive O
prices O
for O
a O
very O
average O
dinner B-TARGET
in O
quality O
and O
very O
pretentious O
in O
presentation... O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
deplorable, O
we O
have O
to O
beg O
them O
to O
take O
the O
order, O
they O
forget O
to O
bring O
the O
water O
carafe, O
they O
ignore O
our O
raised O
hands O
and O
take O
a O
crazy O
time O
for O
the O
addition O

For O
tourists O
and O
more O

It O
was O
5 O
years O
since O
we O
had O
not O
returned O
to O
this O
restaurant O
that O
offers O
a O
superb O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
a O
nice O
neighborhood B-TARGET
of O
Paris... O

But O
what O
a O
disaster O
in O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

When O
we O
arrived, O
3 O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
waiters B-TARGET
passed O
by O
before O
we O
were O
just O
addressed. O

The O
arrival O
of O
the O
manager B-TARGET
was O
caricatural O
with O
her O
fabricated O
table O
plan O
trying O
to O
place O
us O
inside O
despite O
our O
express O
request O
from O
the O
terrace. O

In O
the O
end O
we O
won. O

Sitting O
on O
uncomfortable O
garden O
chairs O
we O
wait O
for O
the O
apero O
that O
arrives O
very O
quickly O
the O
only O
hic O
c O
is O
the O
difference O
between O
our O
two O
glasses B-TARGET
for O
the O
same O
alcohol O
1/4 O
of O
different O
amount. O

I O
give O
you O
the O
food O
of O
which O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
any. O

Even O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
of O
Pierre O
Herme O
that O
I O
would O
invite O
to O
no O
longer O
allow O
distribution O
in O
this O
establishment O
were O
served. O

Too O
much O
fresh. O

To O
accompany O
him O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine. O

Since O
n O
has O
not O
arrived O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
addition, O
I O
indicate O
that O
n O
is O
no O
longer O
worth O
bringing O
it. O

You O
won’t O
believe O
it O
if O
you O
bring O
it O
with O
the O
addition O
by O
telling O
me O
it O
was O
already O
served. O

What O
he O
had O
forgotten O
to O
say O
is O
that O
he O
was O
also O
already O
counted O
in O
the O
addition. O

I O
don’t O
know O
where O
the O
former O
owners O
went, O
but O
someone O
needs O
to O
take O
this O
property B-TARGET
back O
in O
their O
hands. O

Waiting O
for O
a O
single O
word O
of O
order O
do O
not O
go O
there. O

Oh O
yes O
I O
forgot O
not O
to O
look O
at O
the O
map B-TARGET
displayed O
in O
the O
vitrine O
you O
will O
see O
at O
least O
2 O
dead O
flies O
crushed O
I O
dare O
not O
put O
a O
foot O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

I O
have O
a O
picture O
of O
the O
flies. O

But O
I O
don’t O
publish O
it O
for O
sensitive O
souls. O

A O
table B-TARGET
that O
keeps O
the O
road O
in O
a O
neighborhood O
where O
tables O
change O
very O
quickly? O

Sophisticated O
but O
not O
too O
much, O
worldly O
but O
not O
noisy O
at O
all, O
at O
the O
table O
or O
at O
the O
counter. O

Very O
nice O
menu B-TARGET
at O
35 O
euros O
at O
noon O
that O
changes O
all O
the O
time. O

On O
the O
map, B-TARGET
the O
more O
expensive, O
the O
meuniere B-TARGET
solo I-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
delight O
(49 O
euros O
anyway) O
and O
everyone O
knows O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
succeed. O

The O
coastline B-TARGET
also. O

Drink B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
glass I-TARGET
of O
wine O
(fortunately). O

Exquisite O
gourmet B-TARGET
coffee. I-TARGET

In O
any O
case, O
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting B-TARGET
at O
two O
steps O
of O
the O
Invalides. O

What O
a O
pleasure O
from O
the O
welcome, B-TARGET
this O
great O
smile, O
this O
kiss, O
this O
all O
very O
natural, O
we O
are O
no O
longer O
accustomed O
to O
this O
friendly O
side, O
especially O
in O
Paris! O

And O
the O
frame!!! B-TARGET
And O
the O
kitchen!!! B-TARGET
We O
also O
come O
and O
especially O
for O
that O
and O
our O
last O
lunch B-TARGET
was, O
as O
always, O
extra: O
Turbot B-TARGET
pocketed I-TARGET
with O
rubber, O
cream O
sauce O
with O
its O
pineapple O
purée, O
floating B-TARGET
island I-TARGET
and O
pralines B-TARGET
cake...all I-TARGET
watered O
with O
an O
excellent O
Beaujolais...that B-TARGET
of O
happiness O
and O
this O
is O
how O
all O
the O
guests O
become O
familiar, O
or O
rather O
friends O

Sunny O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
Sunday, O
rather O
nice O
decor, B-TARGET
it O
was O
pretty O
well O
announced. O

We O
ordered O
two O
champagne B-TARGET
pools I-TARGET
that O
are O
served O
after O
20 O
minutes... O
and O
no O
ice!!! O

When O
we O
ask O
an O
sour O
waitress B-TARGET
like O
a O
cornichon O
macerated O
in O
vinegar O
for O
54 O
years O
if O
our O
order O
has O
been O
taken O
well O
he O
literally O
attacks O
us O
by O
telling O
us O
that O
champagne O
is O
being O
sought O
(visibly O
directly O
in O
Reims) O

In O
short, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
don’t O
even O
bother O
to O
speak O
in O
English O
to O
the O
poor O
tourists O
who O
failed O
here, O
the O
silicone O
patroness, B-TARGET
botoxed, O
until O
she O
has O
her O
face O
fixed O
(this O
must O
be O
the O
reason O
for O
her O
cruel O
absence O
of O
a O
smile) O
paves O
on O
the O
terrace O
but O
doesn’t O
move O
the O
commands O
forward O
faster... O

In O
short, O
run O
away O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
your O
day O
surrounded O
by O
arrogant O
people! O

Superb O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
welcoming, O
unfortunately O
they O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
describe O
the O
dishes, O
the O
original O
names O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
incomprehensible. O

Once O
served O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
to O
feel O
bad, O
my O
bat B-TARGET
was O
drowned O
under O
an O
absurd O
amount O
of O
insidious O
blue B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
as O
for O
my O
friend’s O
salad B-TARGET
it O
was O
full O
of O
oil, O
fat O
and O
fat. O

We O
both O
fell O
sick O
during O
the O
night. O

Go O
to O
Escape!! O

It O
is O
a O
very O
beautiful O
address... B-TARGET
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
remarkable O
because O
the O
cooking O
is O
perfect, O
the O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
rather O
seasonal O
products, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
home O
made. O

There O
is O
a O
map O
and O
slides O
for O
the O
formulas. O

This O
is O
a O
mix O
of O
creative O
proposals O
but O
also O
great O
classics. O

The O
plate B-TARGET
is O
perfect O
from O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
dessert, O
which O
is O
not O
so O
common. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
is O
focus O
but O
very O
well, O
in O
white O
and O
red. O

We O
are O
in O
a O
logic O
of O
selection O
and O
quality. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
price, O
but O
the O
price B-TARGET
ratio I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
excellent. I-TARGET

The O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
both O
pros O
but O
relaxed, O
there O
is O
what O
it O
takes O
to O
feel O
good O
but O
also O
to O
be O
very O
well O
received O
and O
come O
back! O

This O
is O
to O
conclude O
a O
very O
beautiful O
address, B-TARGET
a O
rare O
alliance O
of O
tradition O
and O
modernity, O
beautiful O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
that O
remains O
readable, O
pleasant, O
sophisticated O
without O
too O
much. O

No O
wonder O
it O
is O
often O
advised O
by O
gastronomic O
critics. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
ideal O
for O
business O
meals. O

However, O
it O
is O
absolutely O
not O
worth O
the O
tour, O
except O
to O
see O
and O
be O
seen. O

A B-TARGET
la I-TARGET
carte I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
out O
of O
price O
(about O
twenty O
euros O
for O
4 O
vapors... B-TARGET
good O
but O
it O
does O
a O
lot O
for O
a O
steam) O
and O
are O
not O
of O
exceptional O
quality. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
add O
two O
items, B-TARGET
it’s O
a O
supplement!! O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
service, B-TARGET
it O
really O
needs O
to O
be O
revisited. O

Order O
and O
arrival O
from O
the O
endless O
entrance... O
and O
then O
the O
dishes O
that O
do O
not O
come O
together O
and O
half O
of O
the O
accompanying O
ones O
that O
are O
missing. O

In O
short O
to O
avoid!! O

A O
slightly O
complicated O
menu B-TARGET
between O
Bo O
Boun's, O
salads O
and O
the O
rest. O

It O
is O
best O
to O
have O
good O
appetite O
because O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
abundant O
and O
good. O

And O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
pleasant! O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
so O
uncomfortable, O
we O
are O
a O
little O
on O
each O
other O
and O
if O
you O
are O
corpulent, O
prefer O
the O
terrace. O

Staff B-TARGET
is O
often O
overcrowded O
but O
this O
is O
the O
key O
to O
success O
and O
reputation. O

Super O
menu, B-TARGET
unprecedented O
and O
surprising O
flavour O
arrangements, O
very O
pleasant O
setting....it B-TARGET
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
overall O
impression O
is O
served O
by O
a O
high O
and O
unpleasant O
service! B-TARGET

Too O
much O
to O
want O
to O
escape O
the O
codes O
of O
the O
gastronomic O
rest O
(and O
especially O
the O
excessive O
zeal O
that O
can O
sometimes O
characterize O
the O
service), B-TARGET
the O
Chateaubriand O
goes O
to O
my O
mind O
too O
far! O

Sure O
it’s O
an O
honor O
to O
be O
able O
to O
taste O
the O
inventive O
cuisine B-TARGET
of O
a O
chef O
like O
Inaki O
Aizpitarte... O
but O
whatever O
the O
establishment’s O
reputation O
and O
success, O
I O
think O
guests O
have O
the O
right O
to O
expect O
to O
be O
served O
by O
at O
least O
kind O
people O
(even O
if O
just O
because O
they O
pay)! O

For O
my O
part, O
I O
was O
sent O
back O
to O
my O
goals O
for O
having O
had O
the O
misfortune O
to O
ask O
for O
clarifications O
on O
the O
composition O
of O
a O
dessert O
that O
was O
not O
presented O
to O
us O
(in O
this O
case O
the O
tocino O
del O
cielo, O
a O
classic O
of O
the O
house... O
we O
should O
have O
known O
it O
is O
for O
that?). O

And O
the O
person O
who O
accompanied O
me, O
avergnate, O
allowed O
herself O
a O
comment O
with O
a O
big O
smile O
on O
the O
thickness O
of O
the O
slice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
St-Nectaire I-TARGET
that O
had O
been O
served O
to O
her O
(less O
than O
2mm) O
to O
hear O
herself O
answer O
a O
"Ah O
good..." O
dry O
and O
cold. O

In O
short, O
it O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
success O
of O
the O
establishment O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
mounted O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
servers B-TARGET
who O
have O
worn O
away, O
or O
even O
wasted O
what O
could O
have O
been O
a O
very O
good O
time... O

PS: O
Sommelier B-TARGET

Difficult O
to O

Very O
medium O

The O
“home-made” O
is O
actually O
a O
decongested O
home-cooked. O

There O
is O
no O
flexibility O
on O
the O
map. B-TARGET

For O
example, O
if O
you O
order O
fries O
instead O
of O
the O

you O
will O
get O
the O
planned O
fitting O
and O
a O

In O

Arriving O
around O
12:50 O
in O
a O

we O
were O

a O
large O
table O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
room. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
noisy O
but O
relatively O
pleasant. O

After O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour, O
a O
waiter O
arrives. O

He O
takes O
the O
command O
on O
an O
excessive O
tone O
by O
turning O
around O
to O
give O
orders O
to O
the O
other O
servers. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
honest, O
I O
chose O
a O
hot O
goat O
tart, O
my O
husband O
menu O
it O
for O
13 O
euros. O

Honestly O
no O
more. O

In O
short, O
a O
suitable O
address, B-TARGET
if O
one O
agrees O
to O
be O
treated O
as O
a O
simple O
additive O
regulator... O

We O
arrive O
in O
an O
almost O
empty O
room B-TARGET
on O
a O
Friday O
evening, O
despite O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
friend O
of O
this O
restaurant O
as O
being O
a O
good O
gastro O
address O
at O
a O
nice O
price... O

First O
table O
where O
we O
sit, O
the O
bulb O
above O
is O
grilled, O
half O
dark O
and O
the O
candles O
on O
the O
side O
seem O
well O
covered O
with O
dust... O

Just O
like O
the O
horrible O
curtains B-TARGET
hanging O
above O
our O
heads. O

We O
look O
around O
and O
realize O
that O
this O
is O
actually O
a O
prefabricated O
backdrop O
reworked O
with O
a O
questionable O
taste, O
like O
the O
photos O
of O
vintage O
prostitutes O
covering O
the O
walls O
in O
playful O
frames. O

It O
was O
for O
the O
framework. O

A O
complete O
lack O
of O
surprise, O
discovery O
or O
boldness. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
ridiculous, O
three O
bits O
of O
veal B-TARGET
tab O
(veal O
of O
25 O
years O
without O
a O
doubt, O
so O
much O
the O
meat O
is O
red) O
and O
a O
fine O
lamelle O
of O
dolphin O
gratin, B-TARGET
all O
bathing O
in O
an O
insipid O
sauce B-TARGET
that O
seemed O
in O
reality O
to O
be... O
water. O

Tuna B-TARGET
is O
so O
raw O
that O
it’s O
better O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Japanese, O
but O
my O
girlfriend O
loves O
that, O
tuna... O

We O
would O
like O
to O
stop O
the O
cool, O
but O
there O
was O
the O
dessert: O
the O
beautiful O
pear O
Hélène O
"revisited", O
where O
how O
a O
ice B-TARGET
cream O
turns O
into O
a O
chocolate O
bite O
where O
pieces O
of O
fruit O
swim. O

I'm O
never O
writing O
an O
opinion, O
I O
think O
this O
evening O
it O
was O
probably O
a O
fault O
of O
taste O
on O
my O
part. O

Yes, O
it O
must O
be O
that, O
tonight, O
I O
lost O
the O
taste, O
the O
taste O
to O
crack O
100€ O
in O
a O
rest B-TARGET
without O
taste O
or O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

We O
were O
in O
the O
evening O
of O
March O
with O
friends O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
one O
of O
them's O
birthday. O

We O
went O
to O
the O
pub O
restaurant O
for O
dinner. O

But O
since O
we O
were O
too O
many O
(13 O
people), O
we O
were O
installed O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
(as O
well O
specified O
that O
the O
ground O
floor O
was O
intended O
for O
the O
usual O
and O
football O
enthusiasts O
and O
that O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
consume O
it O
had O
to O
go O
down O
again O
to O
order) O
in O
a O
hardly O
illuminated O
Iounge B-TARGET
space I-TARGET
to O
be O
able O
to O
read O
the O
menu O
(we O
had O
to O
use O
the O
lights O
of O
our O
smartphone). O

After O
telling O
the O
staff B-TARGET
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
align O
one O
table O
next O
to O
another, O
we O
went O
down O
again. O

The O
dinner O
begins O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
dish. O

In O
the O
part O
concerning O
the O
burgers B-TARGET
it O
was O
written O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
order O
the O
burger O
without O
the O
bread O
(interest?). O

Asking O
a O
waitress O
if O
taking O
this O
option O
would O
allow O
a O
discount O
on O
the O
price O
(already O
expensive O
enough O
for O
quality), O
the O
manager B-TARGET
came O
by O
saying O
that O
the O
price O
was O
not O
changing O
(after O
that O
comes O
an O
explanation O
on O
the O
margin O
that O
the O
restaurant O
made O
then), O
and O
later O
replied O
"we O
are O
a O
restaurant O
so O
our O
goal O
is O
to O
make O
the O
margin" O
(a O
customer O
relationship O
expert O
that). O

In O
summary O
(because O
it’s O
long O
to O
say), O
we O
spent O
a O
evening O
a O
little O
tired O
by O
the O
image O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
(whose O
state O
leaves O
nothing O
to O
be O
desired), O
a O
table O
service B-TARGET
worthy O
of O
a O
teenage O
canteen, O
and O
no O
small O
word O
of O
excuse O
or O
discount O
(when O
you O
have O
to O
make O
the O
margin O
by O
any O
means...) O
to O
start O
with O
a O
smile O
(it O
wasn’t O
won). O

Having O
been O
tested O
by O
members O
of O
the O
evening O
in O
advance, O
we O
agreed O
that O
this O
was O
the O
first O
time O
for O
some O
and O
the O
last O
time O
for O
all O
of O
us O
to O
come O
to O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

It O
is O
said O
that O
this O
brewery O
chains O
the O
groups O
of O
tourists... O

What O
a O
disgrace O
to O
the O
French!! O

That O
day O
I O
wanted O
a O
beef O
tartar. O

I O
have O
family O
members O
who O
eat O
this O
sign O
and O
I O
join O
them. O

In O
the O
menu O
therefore, O
a O
tab O
of O
beef O
fried O
a O
steak O
fried O
tartar, O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
seller O
with O
puree. O

We O
will O
make O
it O
simple, O

All O
meats B-TARGET
are O
meatless!!! O

Fries B-TARGET
are O
home-made O
but O
made O
in O
advance O
and O
molassonian. O

Better O
than O
in O
the O
canteen. O

and O
escape! O

We O
should O
not O
be O
scared O
of O
this O
scam. O

They O
are O
closing! O

Menu O
of O
the O
day O

Smoked B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
on O
excellent O
celery. O

Hopping B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
tagliatelle O
very O
well O

A O
bit O
expensive O

Two O
small O
remarks O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
overheated, O
which O
is O
unpleasant. O

- O
the O
water B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
caraffe O
is O
not O
fresh O
(to O
link O
with O
the O
previous O
point???) O

Very O
competitive O
for O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
what O
we O
have O
in O
our O
plate. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
but O
very O
expeditious, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
time O
to O
finish O
a O
dish O
that O
we O
are O
asked O
if O
we O
should O
finish. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
a O
hurry, O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
place. B-TARGET

But O
what O
bothered O
me O
is O
the O
following O
thing: O
only O
two O
minutes O
after O
placing O
the O
order, O
we O
were O
already O
served, O
the O
broken O
scalops B-TARGET
would O
be O
all O
done O
in O
advance O
and O
then O
heated? O

The O
prices O
of O
drinks B-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
very O
high O
(4,5 O
euros O
for O
a O
can B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
coca..). I-TARGET

In O
short, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
extraordinary, O
can O
it O
even O
be O
prepared O
long O
in O
advance? O

I O
will O
not O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
and O
will O
not O
go O
back. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
you O
saw O
me. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
smiling O
and O
unwelcome. O

Very O
medium O
cuisine, B-TARGET
chicken B-TARGET
version O
crêpe O
archi O
dry O
with O
a O
handful O
of O
beans O
and O
all O
this O
for O
an O
exorbitant O
price! O

The O
sandwich B-TARGET
club I-TARGET
has O
nothing O
special O
and O
the O
Vietnamese B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
very O
dry O
without O
any O
sauce. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
overloaded O
but O
that O
makes O
the O
charm O
of O
the O
place. O

I O
went O
there O
by O
chance O
with O
friends O
one O
evening O
for O
the O
apero O
and O
I O
came O
back O
there O
for O
lunch O
because O
I O
liked O
the O
15 O
€ O
tapas B-TARGET
formula. I-TARGET

You O
will O
not O
find O
the O
pseudo O
tapas O
that O
can O
be O
found O
on O
all O
terraces O
but O
only O
the O
real O
Spanish B-TARGET
recipes: I-TARGET
calamar O
rabas, O
croquetas O
de O
jamon O
y O
queso, O
tomato O
bread, O
croquetas O
de O
bacalao, O
tortilla, O
serrano, O
piquillos, O
calamars O
with O
ink, O
artichauts O
with O
jambon... O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
sangria B-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
like O
the O
rest: O
Catalan O
cream, O
Basque O
cake, O
sheep O
cheese O
and O
black O
cherry O
marble... O

Not O
all O
of O
the O
servers B-TARGET
speak O
French O
very O
well O
but O
they O
are O
very O
kind O
(and O
their O
Spanish O
accent O
reinforces O
the O
authentic O
side O
of O
the O
place). B-TARGET

Only O
blame: O
many O
tables O
and O
little O
space, O
so O
we O
are O
quickly O
narrowed. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
with O
my O
eyes O
closed. O

15€ O
for O
a O
salad B-TARGET
composed I-TARGET
with O
two O
ingredients: O
green O
salad O
and O
2 O
slices O
of O
smoked O
salmon. O

One O
stands O
out O
with O
the O
hunger O
and O
the O
bad O
impression O
of O
being O
plumed, O
with O
the O
way O
(The O
salmon O
is O
arranged O
so O
that O
it O
hides O
the O
forest O
of O
green O
salad O
that O
gives O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
consistent O
dish). O

If O
you O
are O
hungry, O
go O
away. O

Yesterday O
we O
were O
invited O
by O
friends O
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
with O
friends. O

Doubting O
at O
the O
beginning O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
place, B-TARGET
a O
good O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
good O
quality O
tapas B-TARGET
swallowed, O
we O
finally O
had O
a O
great O
evening O
with O
our O
friends. O

The O
Boss B-TARGET
looks O
RUSTRE O
at O
first, O
but O
he O
plays O
a O
"game" O
and O
is O
super O
cautious O
with O
his O
clients! O

A O
simple O
place B-TARGET
or O
spend O
a O
pleasant O
evening! O

We O
had O
booked O
for O
our O
son’s O
20th O
birthday O
(April), O
what O
a O
disappointment, O
partly O
wasted O
birthday! O

We O
had O
negotiated O
the O
menu O
with O
the O
manager O
and O
we O
were O
confident O
since O
we O
had O
celebrated O
my O
beautiful O
father’s O
70th O
birthday O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
we O
had O
been O
completely O
satisfied. O

Of O
course O
we O
didn’t O
have O
a O
big O
budget, O
$15 O
per O
person O
entrance, O
dish, O
cake. O

But O
no O
quality O
in O
the O
plate, B-TARGET
no O
presentation, O
we O
would O
have O
thought O
of O
a O
meal O
that O
is O
made O
at O
home. O

In O
addition, O
among O
our O
plates B-TARGET
we O
had O
a O
panel O
of O
pieces O
of O
meat O
from O
the O
smallest O
or O
larger! O

On O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
side, O
it O
was O
believed, O
it O
was, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
takes O
the O
3 O
dishes O
concerned, O
comes O
back O
and O
asks O
us O
to O
whom O
were O
the O
dishes?!! O

Moreover, O
microwave O
cooking!!! O
with O
green B-TARGET
beans I-TARGET
cooked O
steam, O
no O
revenue, O
no O
sauce, O
briefly O
regrettable! O

The O
cake: O
a O
freezer, B-TARGET
we O
had O
sought O
the O
strawberries O
and O
stinking O
too O
much O
cream. O

Fortunately O
the O
non-alcoholic B-TARGET
cocktails I-TARGET
and O
cafes B-TARGET
were O
good O
and O
offered, O
but O
we O
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
pay O
for O
them O
and O
have O
something O
better O
in O
the O
plate.A B-TARGET
minimum O
of O
presentation, O
it's O
nothing O
that O
can O
make O
the O
difference O
to O
the O
eye! O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice O
and O
smiling, O
just O
a O
little O
concern O
with O
taking O
the O
3 O
plates O
to O
get O
the O
salmon O
recovered O
but O
otherwise O
nothing O
to O
blame O
her. O

We O
to O
the O
room O
manager, O
he O
was O
very O
embarrassed, O
told O
us O
he O
would O
bring O
back. O

We O
learned O
later, O
change O
of O
owner O
and O
cook O
since O
our O
last O
arrival. O

Located O
between O
the O
arenas O
and O
the O
square O
courtyard, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
crowded. O

Very O
curious O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
has O
nothing O
sensational, O
I O
burned O
my O
palace O
with O
nems. O

Cantonese B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
was O
dry O
and O
I O
waited O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
months O
2 O
unfortunate O
ice O
balls. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
small O
and O
not O
home O
made. O

We O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
better O
meal B-TARGET
less O
fast O
and O
with O
more O
taste. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
makes O
us O
think O
that O
everything O
will O
go O
well, O
but O
nothing O
happens. O

We O
came O
with O
a O
Groupon O
coupon. O

We O
were O
very O
well O
received. O

Fast O
and O
quality O
service. B-TARGET

Fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
beautiful O
presentations. O

Address B-TARGET
to O
be O
held. O

To O
very O
soon. O

in O
a O
small O
street O
of O
Menton, O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
not O
very O
large O
by O
size O
but O
really O
remarkable O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
its O
cuisine: B-TARGET
the O
raviolis O
with O
seafood, O
the O
gambes B-TARGET
(decorated, O
a O
plus O
for O
fun...) O
the O
turbot O

anchois O
on O
the O
rocket O

if O
you O
are O
an O

of O

the O
rose B-TARGET

nice O

entries B-TARGET
around O
17/18€, O

It’s O
worth O
the O
tour...beware: O
reserve! O

Nice O

Going O
there O
from O
time O
to O
time. O

Relatively O
expensive O
for O
quality/price. O

Great O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
outside. O

Welcome B-TARGET
the O
most O
sterile, O
almost O
the O
impression O
of O
bothering. O

We O
ordered O
2 O
pizzas, B-TARGET
looking O
right O
but O
bathing O
in O
the O
oil, O
ok O
we O
are O
in O
the O
south O
so O
we O
pass O
over. O

After O
tasting O
it’s O
the O
drama, O
a O
stone O
in O
my O
friend’s O
pizza. B-TARGET

I O
call O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
to O
complain O
to O
me, O
no O
excuse, O
for O
her O
it O
is O
normal O
because O
it O
is O
fresh O
mushroom O
and O
tells O
us O
that O
next O
time O
they O
will O
make O
frozen... O

After O
being O
taken O
away O
from O
us O
and O
apologizing, O
she O
ended O
up O
apologizing O
timidly O
and O
offering O
us O
a O
coffee. O

to O
escape O

Obviously, O
we O
bothered O
the O
waitress. B-TARGET

The O
mojito B-TARGET
is O
abominable, O
warm, O
much O
too O
sweet, O
lemon O
swallowed O
like O
in O
the O
glass... O

We O
didn’t O
have O
the O
pleasure O
of O
cooking, O
it O
was O
a O
pity. O

Seasonal B-TARGET
cooking I-TARGET

In O
his O

one O
feels O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
boss O
and O
on O
the O
terrace, O
despite O
the O

one O

In O
August O
2014, O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
eat O
pizzas, O
salads O
and O
more O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Serviced B-TARGET
while O
the O
terrace O
was O
not O
filled. O

The O
meals O
arrived O
at O
the O
drop O
count, O
so O
my O
son O
and O
grandson O
had O
their O
pizzas O
10 O
minutes O
after O
us. O

Very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
highly O
recommend O
lunch O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
with O
spa O
package. O

A O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
city O
centre, O
serene. O

I O
will O
not O
repeat O
all O
that O
has O
been O
said O
because O
it O
is O
all O
true!!! O

Extremely O
expensive O
price, O
factory O
to O
money. O

My O
Experience O
revolved O
around O
a O
question O
to O
one O
of O
the O
waiters O
to O
get O
a O
carafe O
of O
water O
after O
consuming O
more O
than O
50 O
euros. O

The O
long-haired, O
brown, O
thirty-year-old O
waitress B-TARGET
rushed O
to O
answer O
me O
in O
a O
very O
contemptuous O
tone O
that O
at O
chamonix O
the O
water O
is O
paying. O

Asserting O
to O
him O
that O
he O
should O
give O
in O
to O
my O
request O
according O
to O
the O
legislation O
in O
force O
in O
our O
country, O
he O
openly O
ignored O
me, O
and O
just O
offered O
to O
consult O
the O
management. O

and O
shameful. O

Perfect O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
table, B-TARGET
given O
the O
small O
area O
of O
the O
place, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
fine. O

You O
have O
to O
go O
there, O
to O
conclude O
the O
extraordinary O
mountainous O
place B-TARGET
at O
3842 O
m. O

Congratulations O
to O
the O
boss O
and O
his O
team. B-TARGET

But O
no O
more. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
friendly O
but O
not O
available. O

We O
took O
a O
hot O
stone O
for O
two. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
just O
in O
quantities O
to O
my O
taste. O

The O
home O
mayonnaise B-TARGET
sauces I-TARGET
were O
good O
but O
no O
more, O
they O
lacked O
a O
bit O
of O
flavor. O

The O
tarot B-TARGET
was O
correct. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
bad, O
but O
I O
was O
not O
packed. O

Divin!! O
Lovely O
place B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
three O
nice O

and O
a O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

My O
wife O
and O
I O
have O
also O
been O
delighted. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
chose O
were O
very O
delicious. O

I’ve O
been O
talking O
about O
famous O
people O
for O
two O
months!! O

It O
was O
as O
if O
noble O
products B-TARGET
had O
disappeared. O

There’s O
not O
just O
the O
hump O
in O
life. O

From O
the O
reception B-TARGET
to O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
everything O
is O
low-end, O
fortunately O
the O
slider B-TARGET
is O
there O
to O
trap O
the O
tourists O
who O
pass O
through O
there. O

to O
avoid!! O

the O

super O
cool O
and O
a O
very O
reasonable O

nice O
location B-TARGET
for O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
what O
disappointment.... O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
doesn't O
speak O
and O
who O
serves O
you O
without O
anything O
advertising O
coted O
kitchen B-TARGET
nothing O
better O

very O
little O
garnied O
and O
quality O

the O

andouillette B-TARGET
and I-TARGET

that O
I O
highly O
recommend..... O
short O
pass O
your O
way..... O

I O
go O
over O
time, O
1:30 O
for O
a O
simple O
meal. O

A O
simple O
hyper O
card B-TARGET
but O
a O
completely O
lost O
waitress. B-TARGET

Errors O
of O
ordering O
and O
a O
patron B-TARGET
who O
refuses O
to O
change O
dishes O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
she O
will O
not O
throw O
the O
plate O
and O
that O
she O
did O
it O
with O
love. O

Apparently O
there’s O
no O
point O
in O
wasting O
money O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
she’s O
inventing O
incensed O
excuses O
to O
get O
the O
pill O
passed. O

English O
people O
on O
the O
terrace O
pay O
before O
the O
end O
and O
leave. O

I O
give O
you O
the O
"pick-up" O
with O
the O
bosses B-TARGET
to O
make O
her O
understand O
that O
her O
reaction O
is O
intolerable O
and O
non-commercial. O

On O
a O
child O
menu O
that O
has O
never O
been O
asked, O
she O
has O
the O
ass O
to O
announce O
to O
me O
at O
the O
addition, O
that O
she O
offers O
me O
the O
2nd O
ice O
ball O
while O
in O
the O
child O
menu O
the O
ice O
has O
only O
one O
ball....(no O
comment). O

Restaurant B-TARGET
should O
not O
advise O
and O
above O
all O
to O
ban O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
the O
profession O
of O
the O
restaurant O
being O
defamed O
by O
this O
kind O
of O
pseudo-restaurant O
who O
should O
think O
about O
changing O
the O
profession. O

A O
very O
pink O
but O
pleasant O
setting B-TARGET
for O
dinner O
in O
a O
couple O
or O
with O
friends. O

Excellent O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
a O
nice O
reception B-TARGET
with O
smiling O
people. O

But O
how O
can O
one O
put O
5 O
stars O
to O
a O
"Asian" O
rest O
or O
everything O
is O
only O
heated, O
freezed O
from O
the O
subway O
or O
promocash. O

There O
are O
fries O
and O
nuggets. O

Really O
very O
passing! O

It’s O
good O
to O
take O
a O
plate O
and O
eat O
it O
in O
front O
of O
the O
TV. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
restaurant, O
go O
by. O

Warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
beautiful O
walled O
back B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
(old O
wall O
of O
the O
city), O
very O
good O
cuisine, B-TARGET
wood B-TARGET
grillings I-TARGET
folded O
in O
front O
of O
our O
eyes, O
quality O
products B-TARGET
and O
reasonable O
price. O

Especially O
not O
to O
miss. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
pleasant; O
the O
proper O
cuisine, B-TARGET
reasonable O
prices, O
in O
short O
it O
is O
good O
but O
is O
it O
the O
number O
of O
people, O
the O
room,... B-TARGET
there O
is O
a O
little O
something O
to O
enthusiasm. O

and O
correct. O

It O
feels O
like O
an O
unfinished. O

We O
are O
there, O
day O
dish O
tagliatelles O
with O
seafood, O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
but O
some O
rubbery, O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
very O
average, O
St. B-TARGET
James I-TARGET
good O
but O
very O
dry O
rice, B-TARGET
short O
better O
elsewhere! O

We O
discovered O
this O
beach B-TARGET
cabanon I-TARGET
by O
chance O
and O
it O
was O
a O
great O
surprise: O
a O
warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
very O
good O
dishes, B-TARGET
a O
lounge-beach O
atmosphere B-TARGET
not O
overwhelmed. O

We O
can O
see O
that O
the O
team B-TARGET
is O
enjoying O
working O
in O
this O
magical O
place. B-TARGET

This O
will O
be O
a O
must-see O
in O
Cassis. O

Very O
good O
table B-TARGET
in O
a O
street O
behind O
the O
harbour O
so O
without O
having O
the O
parade O
of O
tourists O
looking O
at O
your O
plate. O

In O
this O
restaurant O
you O
can O
find O
a O
fragrant O
Provençal B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
presented O
very O
beautifully O
and O
in O
generous O
quantities. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
and O
we O
recommend O
the O
place. B-TARGET

We O
came O
to O
2 O
with O
our O
2-month-old O
baby O
in O
the O
trolley. O

We O
were O
silenced O
in O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
restaurant O
that O
we O
ended O
up O
leaving O
after O
20 O
minutes O
without O
anyone O
coming O
to O
bring O
us O
even O
a O
carafe O
of O
water. O

I O
ate O
with O
friends O
in O
this O
restaurant O
and O
find O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
has O
seriously O
deteriorated, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
has O
2 O
leaves, O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
and O
dessert B-TARGET
are O
backled O
in O
the O
presentation. O

Moreover, O
the O
reception B-TARGET
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
boss O
is O
cold O
unlike O
the O
very O
friendly O
waiters. B-TARGET

The O
laundry O
is O
outdated. O

We O
drank O
on O
the O
terrace. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
were O
pleasant O
but O
not O
a O
peanut O
or O
an O
olive O
at O
the O
aperitive O
time O
unfortunately, O
no O
aperitive O
plate O
either. O

Uncomprehensible O
for O
a O
restaurant. B-TARGET

How O
can O
this O
be O
called O
a O
restaurant? B-TARGET

A O
deplorable O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
a O
mediocre O
cuisine B-TARGET
having O
nothing O
to O
envy O
the O
lack O
of O
freshness O
of O
the O
buffet B-TARGET
in O
particular. O

Next O
time O
we O
are O
going O
to O
Albertville, O
we O
will O
try O
another O
restaurant, O
can O
anyone O
advise O
us O
one??? O

I O
felt O
at O
home O
when O
I O
had O
a O
restaurant. O

A O
delicious O
cuisine B-TARGET
made O
with O
love, O
I O
go O
back O
there O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
can O
for O
myself O
this O
is O
a O
real O
restaurant B-TARGET

We O
came O
to O
14 O
people O
for O
my O
boyfriend’s O
birthday. O

We O
arrived O
around O
20-21h. O

We O
all O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
very O
wide, O
good O
hot O
and O
good O
dishes! B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
for O
the O
apero O
5 O
bottles O
of O
champagne O
+ O
4 O
bottles O
of O
wine O
at O
dinner O
+ O
digestive O
+ O
coffee. O

No O
commercial O
gesture O
to O
pay, O
no O
offer O
or O
proposal...??? O

In O
addition, O
one O
of O
the O
people O
to O
order O
a O
tartar, O
it O
was O
served O
10 O
minutes O
after O
everyone.. O
it O
is O
a O
cold O
dish O
though. O

It O
is O
a O
pity! O

We O
arrived O
at O
5 O
p.m. O
for O
lunch O
last O
Sunday O
around O
13:30 O
p.m. O

This O
is O
the O
end O
of O
service. O

Entrance: O
Cold O
fries O
for O
one O
of O
us. O

Three O
cooks O
of O
marine O
molds O
arrive O
at O
the O
table, O
at O
the O
opening, O
the O
molds B-TARGET
of O
one O
of O
them O
are O
covered O
with O
tomatoes O
and O
not O
the O
others. O

Ask O
the O
server O
if O
this O
is O
normal. O

After O
checking, O
he O
comes O
back O
telling O
us O
that O
this O
is O
decoration. O

Some O
molds B-TARGET
are O
too O
cooked, O
others O
not O
enough. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
taste O
like O
oil. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
my O
marine B-TARGET
mould I-TARGET
coconut I-TARGET
I O
have O
the O
unpleasant O
surprise O
of O
finding O
a O
half O
lemon, O
skin, O
crushed. O

I O
asked O
the O
waitress O
if O
there O
were O
any O
concerns. O

He O
came O
back O
after O
checking O
and O
told O
me O
that O
this O
is O
the O
recipe O
for O
marine O
molds. O

I O
want O
to O
see O
the O
person O
responsible. O

He O
comes O
and O
when O
I O
tell O
him O
about O
my O
dissatisfaction O
asks O
me O
to O
“drop O
a O
tone.” O

Stop O
eating O
immediately. O

The O
note O
that O
is O
presented O
to O
us O
is O
defalled O
with O
a O
coconut O
while O
no O
one O
wants O
to O
eat O
these O
dubious O
molds B-TARGET
anymore. O

We O
will O
then O
be O
insulted O
again O
by O
the O
manager B-TARGET
before O
he O
agrees O
to O
collect O
our O
drinks O
and O
let O
us O
go. O

We O
did O
not O
expect O
great O
cuisine O
in O
this O
very O
tourist O
place B-TARGET
but O
we O
would O
nevertheless O
have O
being O
able O
to O
have O
lunch O
without O
putting O
our O
health O
at O
risk O
and O
without O
getting O
us O
disrespectful O
over O
the O
market! O

Go O
to O
the O
competitors, O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
around O
the O
world!!! O

This O
was O
the O
first O
time O
we O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
offered O
are O
original, O
the O
flavors O
interesting O
but O
the O
quality O
price O
ratio O
is O
not O
at O
your O
disposal. O

18,50 O
€ O
a O
risotto, B-TARGET
where O
I O
looked O
for O
smoked O
salmon O
but O
advertised, O
which O
I O
unfortunately O
did O
not O
find, O
it O
is O
too O
expensive O
as O
good O
as O
it O
is. O

We O
paid O
for O
the O
colorful O
frame B-TARGET
and O
the O
tourist B-TARGET
port I-TARGET
of O
La O
Cotinière. O

If O
only O
that, O
it O
could O
have O
worked, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
catastrophic. O

The O
young O
blonde O
lady O
who O
served O
us O
is O
absolutely O
not O
a O
job. O

The O
ordering O
by O
the O
boss B-TARGET
came O
long O
after O
the O
aperitif O
ended, O
and O
the O
worst O
was O
the O
wine B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
when O
we O
had O
almost O
finished O
our O
dish. O

It O
is O
intolerable. O

Despite O
a O
delicious O
kitchen B-TARGET
we O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there. O

Very O
nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Small O
room O
atmosphere B-TARGET
beach O
Oléronaise. O

Deco B-TARGET
and O
refined O
tables O
(naps O
and O
towels O
in O
fabrics...). O

Very O
smiling O
and O
warm O
staff. O

A O
bit O
expensive O
but O
very O
good. O

That O
said O
at O
home O
with O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
of O
very O
good O
quality O
it O
remains O
very O
interesting. O

Beautiful O
and O
well O
presented O
places. B-TARGET

Very O
good, O
especially O
the O
desserts. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
cocktails B-TARGET
but O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
the O
quantity O
(5/8€) O

Restaurant B-TARGET
open O
outside O
the O
season. O

Terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
shade O
of O
trees O
very O
nice, O
nice O
dishes, B-TARGET
well-prepared O
fish, B-TARGET
beautiful O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Do O
not O
hesitate. O

The O
address O
is O
misleading, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
in O
Castelnaudary O
but O
in O
a O
small O
village O
just O
after. O

Call O
the O
girlfriend B-TARGET
to O
find O
out O
she’s O
cute. O

And O
go O
around, O
for O
a O
top O
and O
generous O
cassoulet. B-TARGET

With O
a O
glass B-TARGET
of O
minerals. O

A O
little O
fat B-TARGET
before. O

It O
is O
not O
for O
the O
regime. O

But O
when O
you O
eat O
well O
and O
well, O
you O
don’t O
get O
fat. O

It O
is O
a O
pleasant O
stop, O
for O
us O
who O
returned O
from O
Bordeaux O
and O
returned O
to O
the O
South O
East O
(the O
patron O
will O
recognize!). O

We O
had O
a O
good O
end O
of O
the O
evening... O
or O
night. O

thank O
you. O

friendly B-TARGET
welcome, O
very O
good O
quality O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
sometimes O
the O
hand O
is O
a O
little O
heavy O
on O
the O
salt, O
little O
problem O
corrected O
since. O

We O
recommend O
it! O

A O
frankly O
"infect" O
cassoulet, B-TARGET
which O
is O
a O
shame O
for O
the O
name O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
for O
a O
so-called O
"traditional O
restaurant O
serving O
a O
chef's O
kitchen B-TARGET
made O
from O
raw O
product" O
(sic)... O
called O
"Cassoulet O
made O
Maison"!. O

Boss O
came O
to O
see O
us O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
service, O
we O
were O
the O
first O
customers O
who O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
settle O
on O
his O
terrace, O
while O
the O
tables O
of O
the O
terraces O
of O
the O
neighboring O
restaurants O
were O
occupied...First O
arrived, O
before O
the O
last O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
the O
addition, O
after O
call. O

Avoid O
both O
for O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
service. B-TARGET

and O
regrettable. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
mistake O
of O
choice O
on O
our O
part. O

Do O
not O
do O
like O
us. O

A O
disappointing O
and O
expensive O
meal. B-TARGET

For O
two O
entrances, O
two O
dishes O
and O
two O
desserts O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
we O
found O
the O
meal B-TARGET
quite O
expensive O
for O
Castelnaudary O
(92€). O

In O
addition, O
it O
all O
came O
from O
canned O
dishes O
or O
it O
was O
frozen O
dishes. B-TARGET

I O
absolutely O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

well O
situated. O

and O
kind O
service. B-TARGET

Pizza B-TARGET
fair O
but O
avoid O
tiramisu. B-TARGET

Beer B-TARGET
is O
Italian. O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
know. O

Excellent O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
research. O

Bravo O
to O
the O
chef O
and O
the O
bakery; O
we O
will O
return O
for O
the O
beef B-TARGET
tongue! I-TARGET

Very O
good O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
in O
a O
typical O
place. O

But O
it O
is O
expensive. O

We O
only O
ate O
one O
dish. O

It’s O
a O
pity O
for O
this O
nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

But O
there O
are O
others O
as O
good O
as O
well O
as O
cheaper. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
is O
indecent. O

Nothing O
good O
even O
the O
potato B-TARGET
was O
not O
cooked! O

Not O
especially O
to O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
well, O
but O
let O
yourself O
boat O
well O
in O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
those O
years. O

You O
don’t O
have O
to O
ask O
for O
anything O
other O
than O
the O
boss’s O
register, O
otherwise O
you’ll O
be O
told O
to O
go O
and O
buy O
the O
CD. O
