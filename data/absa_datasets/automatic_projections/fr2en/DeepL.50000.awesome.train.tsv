Passable O
service. B-TARGET
Overcooked O
dishes, B-TARGET
sauces B-TARGET
frozen O
in O
their O
pot O
(we O
wonder O
if O
they O
were O
not O
on O
other O
tables O
before O
being O
served O
to O
us), O
the O
price O
is O
correct O
but O
the O
taste O
is O
not O
there O
... O
very O
disappointed O
by O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET

We O
liked O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
on O
the O
main O
promenade B-TARGET
of O
Narbonne-Plage, O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
service. B-TARGET

We O
will O
come O
back! O

we O
expected O
better O
(waiting, B-TARGET
average O
quality). O

Not O
bad, O
but O
not O
more. O

We O
don't O
think O
we'll O
go O
back. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
keep O
for O
oneself O
with O
a O
breathtaking O
view B-TARGET
of O
the O
racecourse O
and O
the O
golf O
course. O
Think O
of O
booking O
downstairs O
near O
the O
bay O
windows, O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
with O
a O
smile. O

A O
small O
lady O
welcomes O
us O
without O
a O
smile O
but O
especially O
without O
enthusiasm, O
it O
must O
have O
annoyed O
her O
to O
have O
customers O
on O
a O
Tuesday O
evening O
.... O
3 O
tables. O

In O
short, O
let O
us O
pass O
.... O

We O
order O
anyway, O
pasty O
lasagna, B-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cheese B-TARGET
without O
flavor O
on O
top, O
which O
mitigated O
the O
acidity O
of O
the O
tomato B-TARGET
paste O
... O
! O

Dessert B-TARGET
everything O
but O
house O
.... O
! O

I O
really O
don't O
recommend O
it, O
even O
if O
your O
fridge O
is O
empty O
and O
the O
other O
restaurants O
next O
door O
are O
full O
and O
you O
don't O
know O
where O
to O
go O
..... O

It's O
even O
better O
to O
go O
to O
Mc O
Do! O

Really O
pleasantly O
surprised! O

The O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
is O
very O
good O
and O
well O
served! O

Always O
very O
original, O
we O
taste O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
we O
will O
not O
see O
elsewhere. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
table I-TARGET
is O
really O
tempting, O
we O
cut O
you O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
gourmet B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
or O
fresh O
cake, B-TARGET
homemade! O

You O
feel O
like O
you're O
at O
home O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food! O

And O
the O
team B-TARGET
is O
adorable! O

Go O
there O
also O
for O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
which O
is O
very O
pretty! O

surprising O
concept O
at O
the O
beginning O
but O
very O
efficient O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
friendly! O
the O
tartar B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
home O
made O
fries B-TARGET
are O
as O
much O
as O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price! O

very O
good O

2 O
hours O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
minumum O
no O
service B-TARGET
and O
boss B-TARGET
execrable! O

So O
disappointed O
and O
not O
to O
be O
recommended! O

The O
former O
owners O
didn't O
have O
anything, O
the O
owner O
doesn't O
know O
anything O
about O
restoration O

located O
in O
the O
small O
Venice O
with O
terrace O
at O
the O
edge B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
water, I-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
seemed O
ideal O
for O
this O
day O
spent O
in O
Colmar. O

Then O
we O
were, O
let's O
say, O
surprised O
by O
the O
reception. B-TARGET

A O
rather O
disdainful O
person O
welcomed O
us O
against O
our O
will O
in O
view O
of O
his O
attitude. O

Even O
if O
the O
meal B-TARGET
was O
quite O
copious O
and O
good, O
we O
did O
not O
take O
as O
much O
pleasure O
as O
the O
place B-TARGET
let O
us O
hope. O

Was O
it O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
that O
wanted O
this? O

Apart O
from O
this O
character, O
the O
other O
people O
in O
this O
restaurant O
were O
courteous O
and O
very O
affable... O
too O
bad O

At O
the O
beginning O
it O
was O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
then O
little O
by O
little O
it O
went O
down O
in O
quality O
without O
stopping! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
average, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
also O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
and O
quantity O

We O
are O
used O
to O
this O
place O
since O
3 O
years, O
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
getting O
better. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
well O
prepared O
and O
changes O
regularly, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
professional, O
attentive O
and O
charming. O

Never O
disappointed O
since O
3 O
years. O

Keep O
it O
up! O

We O
went O
there O
by O
chance O
and O
were O
not O
disappointed! O

The O
warmth O
of O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
contribute O
to O
a O
certain O
well-being! O

Despite O
the O
crowd, O
we O
were O
quickly O
served. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
wine B-TARGET
offered O
were O
succulent. O

We O
will O
return O
there! O

Lousy B-TARGET
reception! I-TARGET

Interminable O
wait! B-TARGET

First O
dish O
served: O
insects O
present! O

We O
alerted O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
blamed O
us O
(insects O
coming O
from O
outside). O

We O
let O
a O
second O
chance. O

Second O
dish O
served: O
still O
INSECTS. O

Staff O
response: O
"If O
you O
didn't O
want O
bugs, O
you O
should O
have O
eaten O
inside!" O

I O
strongly O
advise O
against O
this! O

I O
rarely O
eat O
the O
daily O
specials O
in O
the O
restaurants O
I O
go O
to O
but O
I O
made O
an O
exception O
this O
time. O

The O
people O
I O
was O
having O
lunch O
with O
ordered O
the O
daily O
special O
and O
I O
did O
the O
same O
as O
them O
so O
we O
wouldn't O
be O
late. O

This O
one O
was O
of O
an O
excellent O
quality/price O
ratio O
and O
very O
good O
in O
more. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
by O
the O
owner O
is O
always O
smiling O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
service O
is O
dynamic O
and O
professional. O

Knowing O
well O
the O
cooking B-TARGET
of O
her O
husband O
I O
am O
not O
surprised O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
has O
just O
been O
refreshed O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
and O
the O
half-timbered B-TARGET
house I-TARGET
that O
houses O
the O
restaurant O
has O
also O
been O
renovated, O
in O
short: O
All O
positive. O

Small O
restaurant O
with O
a O
neat O
decoration, B-TARGET
with O
well O
laid O
tables. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
lacking O
in O
warmth, O
and O
so O
is O
the O
service B-TARGET
that O
follows. O

The O
different O
menus B-TARGET
based O
on O
"Mezzés" O
are O
similar, O
the O
specialties O
are O
successful O
for O
some O
(hummus, B-TARGET
tabbouleh), B-TARGET
less O
successful O
for O
others O
such O
as O
the O
eggplant B-TARGET
puree I-TARGET
rather O
bland O
or O
these O
dumplings B-TARGET
with O
an O
aftertaste O
"burned". O

We O
are O
in O
the O
classic O
of O
the O
genre O
with O
few O
surprises O
and O
rather O
high O
prices. O

Special O
mention O
however O
to O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
(Lebanese) O
and O
to O
the O
gesture O
of O
the O
restaurant O
owner B-TARGET
who O
offered O
a O
part O
of O
the O
desserts. O

Let's O
go, O
a O
good O
evening O
all O
the O
same, O
but O
a O
desired O
effort O
on O
the O
Mediterranean O
tastes O
and O
flavors! O

Not O
to O
be O
missed! O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
every O
respect, O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
owner B-TARGET
very O
pleasant, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
excellent, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
very O
good! O

Tourists O
of O
passage O
in O
the O
corner O
we O
shall O
return O
there O
without O
hesitating O
a O
next O
time O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants B-TARGET
made O
since O
a O
long O
time O

Tapas O
bar O
in O
the O
evening, O
changing O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
sometimes O
approximate. O

The O
wines B-TARGET
are O
good O
but O
not O
excellent, O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
when O
there O
are O
still O
some O
are O
good, O
fortunately O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
wanted O
to O
push O
the O
door O
of O
this O
place O
in O
the O
port O
area O
of O
Bayonne O
and O
here O
we O
are! O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
could O
be O
revisited O
but O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
order O
taking O
is O
fast O
and O
very O
smiling. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
classic O
but O
correct O
with O
a O
price O
that O
is O
also. O
Then O
comes O
the O
musical B-TARGET
atmosphere I-TARGET
that O
corresponds O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
we O
have O
of O
these O
places. O

Good O
evening O
spent O
in O
this O
place B-TARGET

Meat B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
like O
chewing O
gum, O
fries B-TARGET
color O
dark O
brown O
soft O
and O
still O
bathing O
in O
their O
oil. O

Austere O
service. B-TARGET

What O
more O
can O
we O
say? O

We O
have O
rarely O
eaten O
so O
badly O
in O
Bordeaux. O

First O
of O
all, O
there O
is O
a O
big O
failure O
in O
terms O
of O
hygiene: O
the O
cook O
goes O
outside O
with O
his O
gloves O
and O
then O
returns O
to O
the O
kitchen O
without O
changing O
them... O

Then, O
uncooked O
meat B-TARGET
and O
soft O
fries B-TARGET
.... O
(sick O
the O
next O
day) O

In O
the O
evening, O
there O
is O
no O
menu, O
so O
it O
is O
very O
expensive O
(in O
my O
opinion, O
the O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
not O
good O
enough). O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
original O
and O
attractive O
and O
the O
products B-TARGET
of O
quality, O
unfortunately O
the O
note O
is O
too O
salty O
compared O
to O
the O
delivered O
experience. O

Indeed, O
the O
rather O
heavy O
reception B-TARGET
gives O
way O
to O
a O
service B-TARGET
lacking O
enthusiasm O
and O
smile. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
good, O
well O
cooked O
and O
presented O
but O
the O
price O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
is O
rather O
high O
and O
in O
the O
end, O
the O
bill O
is O
out O
of O
step O
with O
the O
experience O
(more O
than O
100€ O
for O
two O
for O
1 O
starter/2 O
courses/1 O
dessert O
with O
wine O
and O
coffee), O
in O
a O
rather O
successful O
vintage/rustic O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
but O
spoiled O
by O
a O
pop/variety O
music B-TARGET
without O
any O
link O
with O
the O
setting O
and O
the O
concept, O
broadcasted O
a O
little O
too O
loudly O
for O
a O
restaurant O
where O
one O
wants O
to O
spend O
a O
moment O
of O
calm O
and O
relaxation. O

My O
favorite O
of O
the O
year O
2014. O

Cheese O
lover, O
when O
I O
went O
down O
in O
the O
cheese B-TARGET
cellar, I-TARGET
in O
unlimited O
access, O
with O
more O
than O
200 O
cheeses O
to O
taste, O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
in O
paradise O
for O
32€. O

Add O
to O
that O
a O
nice O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
nuts I-TARGET
and O
bread O
with O
figs, O
bacon O
and O
so O
on, O
plus O
a O
nice O
service, B-TARGET
I O
had O
a O
great O
time O
every O
time O
I O
came O
here O
(my O
first O
visit O
was O
followed O
by O
others). O

Possibility O
of O
eating O
dishes B-TARGET

the O
theme O

20/20 O
for O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
an O
evening O
stopover O
very O
nice O
with O
a O
welcoming O
reception. B-TARGET

Simple O
but O
effective O
for O
an O
evening O
meal, O
to O
discover O
but O
the O
midday O
it O
must O
be O
good. O

We O
were O
five O
for O
a O
business O
meal, O
everything O
went O
very O
well, O
we O
all O
found O
our O
dishes B-TARGET
excellent, O
we O
will O
return O
with O
pleasure. O

I O
came, O
like O
every O
year O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
for O
my O
birthday, O
I O
had O
booked O
on O
the O
internet. O

We O
arrived, O
the O
manager O
could O
not O
find O
us O
on O
the O
reservations. O

He O
said O
that O
he O
does O
not O
look O
at O
the O
internet O
anymore... O
Why O
offer O
the O
option O
in O
this O
case O
????? O

And O
us O
case O
where O
it O
can... O

Bread B-TARGET
of O
the O

burned, O
we O
are O
told O
that O
it O
is O
normal... O
A O
waitress B-TARGET
of O
a O
certain O
age O
very O
very O
unpleasant O
and O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
see O
the O
customers O
leave, O
not O
even O
finished O
the O
starter, O
we O
are O
taken O
the O
dish, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
tell O
you O
the O
reflections O
of O
a O
doubtful O
taste. O

It O
has O
changed O
a O
lot, O
we O
will O
not O
go O
there O
again O
..... O

It O
had O
been O
15 O
years O
since O
I O
had O
returned O

Very O
disappointed: O

Very O
noisy O
room B-TARGET

Very O
special O
waitress B-TARGET

Meal B-TARGET
very O
average O
not O
of O
sauce O
even O
by O
asking O
of O
it O
to O
the O

answer O
of O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
"this O
evening O
it O
is O
the O

Meal B-TARGET
not O
very O
well O
presented O

Digestion O
complicated O
the O
next O
day O
all O
my O
friends O
and O
myself O
... O

Very O
very O
long O
service, B-TARGET
the O
boss B-TARGET
telling O
her O
life O
story O
while O
the O
restaurant O
is O
crowded O
and O
everyone O
is O
waiting, O
mistakes O
in O
the O
dishes, O
noise O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
etc.. O

We O
had O
our O
food O
delivered O
several O
times O
and O
we O
were O
never O
disappointed O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
on O
the O
spot O
is O
deplorable... O

However, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

Invited O
for O
a O
professional O
dinner O
(group O
of O
20 O
people) O
we O
were O
presented O
this O
restaurant O
as O
a O
good O
address O
in O
the O
city. O

It O
is O
thus O
with O
the O
water O
with O
the O
mouth O
that O
we O
were O
received O
in O
this O
establishment. O

Complete O
menu O
with O
a O
very O
good O
quality/price O
ratio O
(proposed O
products, B-TARGET
cooking O
and O
presentation O
of O
the O
plates) B-TARGET
and O
fast O
service B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
improve O
some O
points O
to O
be O
a O
good O
restaurant: B-TARGET
maintenance O
of O
the O
sanitary O
appliances O
in O
the O
"water O
room", O
warmth O
of O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
choice O
of O
the O
proposed O
wines B-TARGET
(I O
just O
saw O
on O
tripadvisor O
that O
it O
was O
a O
wine O
bar, O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
concept O
then) O

Small O
restaurant B-TARGET
suggested O
by O
a O
friend, O
we O
do O
not O
regret O
the O
experience! O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
proposed O
according O
to O
the O
arrival, O
concise O
menu B-TARGET
but O
extremely O
tasty O
dishes. B-TARGET

To O
recommend O
absolutely. O

Really O
an O
address B-TARGET
to O
remember O
for O
the O
amateurs O
of O
meat, O
an O
entrecote B-TARGET
which O
melts O
in O
the O
mouth, O
a O
simple O
but O
tasty O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
a O
glass O
of O
good O
quality O
wine. B-TARGET

I O
really O
recommend O
this O
address. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
everything... O
:-) O

Welcome O
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
pleasant O
and O
efficient O

All O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good O
with O
a O
special O
mention O
for O
the O
Breton B-TARGET
cassoulet I-TARGET

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
crowded O
at O
lunchtime, O
it's O
better O
to O
arrive O
early O

Icy B-TARGET
welcome, I-TARGET
as O
soon O
as O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
take O
the O
menu, O
you O
come O
to O
take O
your O
order. O

Count O
three O
quarters O
of O
an O
hour O
to O
have O
only O
the O
dish. O

Moreover O
dish O
which O
is O
roughly O
transmitted O
to O
us O
from O
hands O
to O
hands. O

I O
don't O
call O
that O
a O
service B-TARGET
worthy O
of O
a O
restaurant. O

Meat B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
cooked O
as O
we O
requested: O
rare O
and O
not O
medium O
rare O
as O
requested. O

No O
dessert O
order O
was O
taken O
after O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
course. O

So O
we O
decided O
to O
leave O
without O
dessert! O

Departure B-TARGET
as O
unpleasant O
as O
the O
reception. B-TARGET

Disappointed O
with O
our O
evening O
because O
I O
knew O
this O
tavern B-TARGET
under O
better O
days. O

Much O
too O
expensive O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

A O
quality/price B-TARGET
ratio O
that O
does O
not O
need O
any O
comment. O

I O
don't O
recommend O
it O
+++ O
. O

We O
have O
rarely O
eaten O
such O
a O
mediocre O
pizza... B-TARGET
not O
cooked, O
badly O
topped,... O

AFFREUX!!! O
not O
to O
be O
recommended!!! O

Very O
good O
restaurant... B-TARGET
Lunch O
with O
a O
group O

Fast O
service B-TARGET
considering O
the O
number O
of O
tables, O
well O
filled O
plate, B-TARGET
nice O
staff, B-TARGET
sufficient O
choice O

A O
very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET

place B-TARGET
relaxed O
simple. O

without O
pretension O

but O
a O
pleasant O
moment O
with O
friends O
for O
an O
unbeatable O
quality-price O
ratio O

very O
good O
paella B-TARGET
(for O
the O
connoisseurs) O
yes O
grilled O
at O
the O
bottom O
like O
in O
Barcelona O

copious O
and O
good O
tapas B-TARGET

excellent O
meats B-TARGET
for O
the O
amateurs O

atypical O
boss B-TARGET
but O
to O
know. O

very O
with O
the O
listening! O

1st O
time O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
level O
of O
the O
kitchen O
in O
the O
restaurants O
that O
I O
frequent O
in O
Rennes, O
too O
bad. O

Nice O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
I O
was O
refused O
to O
correct O
the O
shot O
on O
a O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
served O
more O
generously O
previously O
(at O
5.90€ O
the O
glass, O
the O
behavior O
of O
the O
boss B-TARGET
(?) O
is O
disappointing). O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
good, O
well O
cooked O
as O
requested. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
soft, O
a O
pity O
too, O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
serves O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
potatoes. O

In O
short, O
a O
formula B-TARGET
with O
correct O
prices O
for O
the O
city O
center, O
a O
real O
potential O
but O
lack O
of O
commercial O
sense O
and O
small O
snags O
that O
jam...still O
a O
pity, O
especially O
to O
have O
done O
it O
to O
a O
merchant O
of O
the O
food O
industry O
of O
the O
corner... O

a O
good O
little O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
serves O
excellent O
pizzas B-TARGET
or O
other O
small O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
prefer O
to O
start O
something O
else O

late O
service B-TARGET
possible: O
convenient O
after O
a O
good O
movie O

good O
welcome B-TARGET

A O
boss O
who O
could O
be O
a O
textbook O
case O
in O
hotel O
schools. O

He O
doesn't O
say O
hello, O
bows O
his O
head, O
doesn't O
look O
you O
in O
the O
eye O
and O
gives O
the O
feeling O
that O
you O
are O
disturbing O
him. O

I O
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
thanking O
him O
for O
the O
service O
and O
apologizing O
for O
disturbing O
him O
while O
he O
was O
working. O

He O
replied O
that O
it O
bothered O
him O
to O
work O
on O
a O
Sunday. O

I O
live O
in O
Dijon O
and O
this O
is O
the O
last O
time O
I O
will O
be O
there. O

We O
always O
enjoy O
eating O
"Italian O
style" O
in O
this O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Dijon. O

But O
last O
time, O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
less O
good: O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
dough I-TARGET
was O
difficult O
to O
cut, O
shouldn't O
the O
boss O
buy O
new O
knives, O
because O
the O
ones O
from O
IKEA O
leave O
something O
to O
be O
desired O
for O
this O
kind O
of O
dishes. O

And O
it's O
still O
difficult O
to O
come O
and O
eat O
without O
a O
reservation! O

On O
the O
place B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Bareuzay, I-TARGET
symbolic O
of O
Dijon, O
a O
pleasant O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
banal, O
with O
a O
classic O
"Burgundian O
dishes" O
option. O

The B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
very O
limited O
in O
choice, O
both O
in O
quantity O
and O
in O
quality. O

We O
took O
an O
andouillette O
with O
a O
Dijon O
mustard O
sauce O
and O
its O
accompanying O
French O
fries O
and O
an O
andouillette O
with O
small O
vegetables O
and O
mashed O
potatoes. O

The O
andouillette B-TARGET
which O
was O
not O
a O
5A O
was O
excellent, O
the O
fries, B-TARGET
vegetables B-TARGET
and O
mashed B-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
also. O

Globally O
satisfactory. O

Nothing O
to O
reproach O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
except O
the O
haste O
to O
close O
the O
store! O

On O
the O
form: O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
rather O
well O
decorated, O
luminous O
and O
pleasant, O
quite O
in O
the O
American O
style. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
is O
smiling O
and O
welcoming, O
even O
if O
he O
sometimes O
makes O
too O
much O
of O
it, O
but O
it's O
better O
that O
way. O

On O
the O
substance: O
I O
went O
there O
twice O
in O
the O
last O
3 O
months O
to O
eat O
a O
hamburger O
and O
frankly O
the O
content O
of O
the O
plate B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
price O
and O
it O
is O
really O
on O
this O
point O
that O
the O
problem O
lies. O

The O
burgers B-TARGET
are O
sold O
between O
12 O
and O
16 O
euros O
which O
is O
too O
much O
for O
very O
industrial O
preparations: B-TARGET
bread B-TARGET
hardened O
by O
cooking, O
no O
vegetables O
in O
the O
sandwich B-TARGET
and O
fries B-TARGET
which O
are O
not O
home O
made. O

In O
summary O
this O
establishment O
is O
a O
bit O
like O
Canada O
Dry, O
it O
looks O
like O
but O
it O
is O
not O
.... O

A O
previous O
experience O
in O
this O
establishment O
in O
2013 O
made O
me O
want O
to O
go O
back O
there O

If O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
the O
setting B-TARGET
are O
pleasant, O
don't O
be O
in O
a O
hurry, O
2h30 O
for O
the O
daily O
menus, O
that's O
getting O
to O
be O
a O
lot O

In O
addition, O
7 O
euros O
50 O
for O
two O
eggs B-TARGET
mimosa I-TARGET
without O
frills O
is O
simply O
a O
steal O

I O
pass O
you O
the O
lukewarm O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
without O
supported O
flavor O

The O
coffee O
offered O
can't O
erase O
everything O

So O
disappointed O
with O
my O
second O
experience, O
my O
wallet O
will O
remember O
it O

We O
had O
lunch O
in O
this O
restaurant O
with O
our O
family. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
generous. O

Having O
been O
able O
to O
taste O
the O
crêpe B-TARGET
montagnarde, I-TARGET
this O
one O
is O
copious O
and O
well O
furnished. O

The O
cider, B-TARGET
not O
that O
exceptional, O
is O
fresh O
and O
goes O
well O
with O
it. O

When O
the O
price, O
I O
do O
not O
find O
them O
excessive O
when O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
served. O

To O
make O
in O
family, O
in O
couple O
or O
between O
friends O

the O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice. O

the O
place B-TARGET
has O
a O
felted O
light, O
it O
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
very O
relaxing. O

the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

the O
service B-TARGET
is O
perfect. O

Very O
disappointed O
: O
Dishes, B-TARGET
decoration B-TARGET
a O
little O
old-fashioned. O

Cobwebs, O
tablecloth O
not O
very O
clean. O

As O
for O
the O
meal, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
twice O
for O
the O
wine O
we O
had O
taken O
as O
an O
aperitif. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
not O
served O
at O
the O
right O
temperature. O

Beautiful O
glasses O
would O
have O
been O
appreciated O
to O
drink O
a O
good O
wine. B-TARGET

For O
the O
main O
course, O
the O
waiter O
told O
us O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
served O
with O
a O
foie O
gras O
sauce, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
find O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
foie O
gras O
because O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
a O
wine B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
that O
completely O
masked O
the O
foie O
gras. O

For O
the O
dessert O
: O
nothing O
extraordinary O
but O
classics O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
butter O
cream. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
you O
don't O
leave O
with O
hunger O
because O
it O
is O
copious. O

In O
conclusion, O
far O
too O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
ate: O
lack O
of O
originality O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
par. O

We O
can O
only O
say O
good O
things O
about O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
simply O
incredible O
/ O
the O
unique O
menu B-TARGET
at O
36 O
euros O
makes O
you O
discover O
some O
typical O
Corsican O
dishes.... O

Attention O
pantagruelic O
menu... B-TARGET

Of O
the O
good O
kitchen B-TARGET
of O
grand O
mother O
who O
holds O
in O
the O
body. O

And O
to O
top O
it O
all O
off, O
friendly O
waiters B-TARGET
with O
a O
strong O
accent O
and O
always O
a O
touch O
of O
humor. O

Frankly...when O
you O
come O
from O
the O
Basque O
country... O

One O
appreciates O
the O
Corsican O
heat O
like O
that! O

Bravo O

Not O
very O
good. O

Dry O
pizza, B-TARGET
very O
few O
ingredients O
and O
a O
huge O
dry O
edge O
for O
the O
Regina O
bianca. O

It O
is O
certainly O
not O
worth O
the O
price... O

Nice O
little O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
during O
our O
2 O
hour O
stopover O
after O
our O
boat O
ride. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
was O
correct O
for O
a O
quick O
stopover, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
landscape B-TARGET
beautiful. O

Really O
horrible, O
some O
things B-TARGET
are O
reheated, O
some O
not O
cooked, O
you O
can't O
call O
it O
cooking! O

Really O
bad! O

Excellent O
burgers, B-TARGET
we O
are O
addicted O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
have O
tasted. O

The O
"complete" B-TARGET
is O
famous, O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
"samurai" B-TARGET
of O
its O
competitor O
the O
bigban. B-TARGET

I O
miss O
it! O

unique O
in O
Besançon. O

In O
addition O
the O
cook B-TARGET
is O
adorable. O

To O
take O
away O
only. O

Yes, O
we O
are O
warned, O

Yes, O
it's O
fresh, O

Yes, O
it's O
cooked O
to O
perfection O

But O
then O
: O

The O
announced O
complexity O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
where O
is O
it? O

It's O
not O
to O
die O
for O

There O
may O
be O
some O
sauces B-TARGET
"on O
the O
shelf" O
in O
the O
dishes O
cooked O

In O
short, O
nothing O
that O
justifies O
3 O
hours O
at O
the O
table O
for O
2 O
dishes O
for O
4 O
people, O
if O
not O
a O
good O
way O
to O
stand O
out O
from O
other O
restaurants O
Vietnam O
/ O
Thai. O

Good O
communication O
! O

Zero O
welcome B-TARGET

REFUSAL O
OF O
PASSTIME O
while O
they O
are O
inside O
and O
warned O
at O
the O
reservation O
and O
when O
arriving. O

It O
is O
a O
BEAUTIFUL O
SCAM O
!!!! O

We O
were O
INSULTED O
by O
the O
manager B-TARGET
on O
December O
20, O
2014 O
is O
INADMISSIBLE O
!!!! O

Too O
bad O
for O
the O
bosses O
who O
lose O
people O
because O
of O
the O
employee B-TARGET
who O
takes O
himself O
for O
a O
boss O
precisely! O

A O
young O
waiter B-TARGET
very O
nice O
I O
pity O
him! O

ADIEU O
!!! O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
really O
nice O
and O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
which O
contrasts O
with O
the O
lack O
of O
friendliness O
of O
one O
of O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
who O
is O
quite O
unpleasant O
and O
a O
master O
in O
the O
art O
of O
making O
comments O
to O
the O
customers. O

The O
other O
waitress O
was, O
for O
her O
part, O
very O
clumsy O
in O
her O
service. B-TARGET

And O
to O
complete O
the O
picture, O
the O
very O
loud O
music B-TARGET
in O
the O
lounge O
area O
prevents O
any O
conversation O
between O
the O
guests, O
which O
is O
a O
pity O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
overall, O
except O
for O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
that O
were O
sold O
to O
us O
as O
homemade O
but O
which O
seem O
to O
come O
from O
Metro O
or O
other O
catering O
suppliers! O

To O
conclude, O
the O
menu O
has O
a O
few O
spelling O
mistakes. O

It O
would O
not O
take O
much O
to O
improve O
the O
whole. O

A O
simple O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
fresh O
and O
home-made O
products. B-TARGET

Warm O
welcome. B-TARGET

Even O
the O
small O
cookies B-TARGET
that O
accompany O
the O
coffee O
are O
home-made. O

Nothing O
to O
say, O
simple O
but O
very O
good O
and O
fresh. O

Top O
notch O
welcome! B-TARGET

Restaurant B-TARGET
without O
pretention O
according O
to O
the O
frontage O
but O
with O
a O
kitchen B-TARGET
of O
quality! O

Kir O
offered O
with O
a O
appetizer O
with O
rillettes O
and O
sausage. O

Not O
much O
choice O
on O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
but O
that's O
also O
how O
we O
have O
more O
chance O
to O
make O
good O
dishes! B-TARGET

And O
it's O
a O
success! O

It's O
my O
canteen, O
I O
love O
it! O

Keep O
on O
like O
this O
I O
warmly O
encourage O
you! O

A O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
a O
very O
young O
and O
pleasant O
staff, B-TARGET
in O
the O
bar O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
quality-price O
ratio O
remains O
tight, O
a O
little O
expensive O
for O
the O
meals, B-TARGET
even O
if O
the O
space B-TARGET
is O
interesting, O
between O
the O
trees. O

The O
interest O
would O
be O
to O
discover O
young O
artists O
who O
regularly O
perform O
there. O

Unfortunately, O
they O
are O
hardly O
respected: O
bad O
acoustics, O
noisy O
public. O

The O
managers O
should O
be O
invited O
to O
allow O
a O
listenable O
sound. O

The O
concept O
seemed O
nice, O
but O
who O
are O
we O
kidding? O

The O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
microscopic O
and O
the O
prices O
stratospheric! O

Count O
about O
20€ O
for O
an O
egg O
casserole B-TARGET
(not O
even O
cooked O
properly), O
a O
dish B-TARGET
including O
about O
50g O
of O
chicken O
and O
3 O
green O
beans O
and O
two O
potato O
slices O
and O
a O
fruit O
salad... O

Extremely O
noisy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
place. O

In O
short, O
to O
be O
avoided, O
unless O
you O
are O
really O
not O
hungry... O

Good O
food B-TARGET
but O
in O
the O
end O
the O
bill O
is O
high O

Dishes B-TARGET
well O
executed, O
the O
sauces B-TARGET
are O
also O
good O

Parpadelle B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crayfish I-TARGET
and O
clams B-TARGET
very O
good O
but O
slightly O
too O
fatty O

The O
veal B-TARGET
was O
tasty O

The O
tarte B-TARGET
tatin I-TARGET
was O
divine O

Very O
nice O
welcome B-TARGET
in O
this O
small O
restaurant. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
small O
but O
very O
pleasant O

At O
the O
level O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
it O
is O
correct O
but O
it O
is O
not O
exceptional! O

(I O
am O
a O
fan O
of O
Italian O
cuisine O
and O
I O
go O
regularly O
to O
Italy O
so O
I O
am O
quite O
difficult!) O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
the O
chocolate B-TARGET
fondant I-TARGET
is O
very O
good O

Dishes O
correctly O
served, O
an O
excellent O
turbot B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
and O
correct O
prices O
for O
the O
area. O

And O
to O
wrap O
it O
all O
up, O
a O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
smile O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end O
:)! O

I O
always O
come O
back O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
with O
a O
real O
pleasure! O

Restaurant B-TARGET
from O
now O
on O
to O
be O
avoided. O

Bad O
value O
for O
money. O

The O
entrecote B-TARGET
which O
in O
the O
menu O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
300 O
g O
it O
was O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
son-in-law O
canteen O
of O
the O
school. O

And O
in O
general O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
ridiculous O
for O
their O
price. O

The O
sautéed B-TARGET
apples I-TARGET
were O
simple O
fries. O

Too O
bad, O
because O
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
still O
impressive. O

An O
excellent O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
magret B-TARGET
au I-TARGET
miel I-TARGET
is O
divine, O
the O
soufflé B-TARGET
perfect, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
very O
pleasant, O
the O
service B-TARGET
fast, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
great, O
a O
good O
time O
with O
the O
family! O

Not O
within O
the O
reach O
of O
all O
the O
purses, O
without O
being O
very O
expensive. O

If O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
correct O
(scallops B-TARGET
- I-TARGET
risotto) I-TARGET
... O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
be O
too O
hungry O
... O
only O
three O
scallops O
the O
whole O
hardly O
hot. O

For O
the O
other O
dishes, B-TARGET
no O
green O
vegetable O
is O
proposed O
in O
accompaniment O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
be O
satisfied O
with O
French O
fries, O
mashed O
potatoes O
risotto O
or O
the O
vegetables O
of O
the O
pot O
au O
feu....The O
non-existent O
service, B-TARGET
with O
the O
question O
what O
is O
there O
in O
the O
coffee O
gourmet O
the O
answer O
was O
that O
depends... O

A O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
ruffles O
her O
hair O
behind O
the O
bar... O
And O
the O
little O
touch O
that O
goes O
well O
we O
came O
out O
impregnated O
with O
a O
smell O
of O
fried O
food... O

In O
short, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
make O
a O
detour O
to O
eat O
in O
this O
bistro B-TARGET

Always O
very O
full O
at O
lunchtime, O
I O
only O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
go O
there O
in O
the O
evening. O

And O
each O
time, O
no O
disappointment: O
varied O
menu, B-TARGET
fresh O
and O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
tasty O
dishes, B-TARGET
copious O
portions B-TARGET
and O
very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

The O
prices O
remain O
correct O
too. O

To O
be O
recommended! O

It's O
been O
three O
times O
now O
that O
I O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
three O
times O
that O
I O
always O
enjoy O
myself O
as O
much. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
tasty O
and O
in O
good O
quantities. O

There O
is O
something O
for O
everyone O
(meat, O
fish). O

I O
strongly O
recommend O
the O
mussel B-TARGET
cassolette I-TARGET
or O
the O
blood O
sausage B-TARGET
(if O
it O
comes O
back O
on O
the O
menu), O
but O
on O
the O
whole, O
everything O
is O
good. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
plate, I-TARGET
if O
you O
have O
some O
space O
left, O
is O
generous O
and O
excellent. O

We O
understood O
therefore O
a O
small O
blow O
of O
heart: O
go O
there O
between O
friends O
or O
between O
lovers O
you O
will O
never O
be O
disappointed! O

We O
came O
to O
dine O
in O
family O
in O
this O
restaurant O
at O
the O
end O
of O
November O
2014. O

We O
spent O
a O
good O
time. O

Small O
hitch: O
the O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
charcuterie I-TARGET
proposed O
at O
the O
aperitif O
for O
two O
people O
was O
really O
not O
copious, O
even O
for O
two O
people. O

But O
for O
the O
rest, O
varied O
cuisine, B-TARGET
good O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
we O
will O
come O
back! O

Very O
long O
and O
cold O
service. B-TARGET

Frozen O
and O
badly O
defrosted O
food. B-TARGET

For O
the O
same O
price, O
you O
can O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
places O
in O
the O
same O
street! O

Dinner O
with O
friends O
and O
awful O
experience. O

Incredibly O
slow O
service. B-TARGET

A O
single O
menu B-TARGET
imposed O
for O
the O
table O
of O
ten O
(!!!!). O

Terrible O
choice. B-TARGET

Poor O
presentation O
of O
dishes. B-TARGET

Terrible O
taste O
- O
never O
take O
the O
disgusting O
tasting O
beef B-TARGET
in O
a O
pot O
of O
mashed O
potatoes O
like O
a O
bitter O
soup. O

Extremely O
expensive: O
185 O
euros O
per O
couple. O

Avoid!!!! O

Unthinkable O
that O
restaurants B-TARGET
like O
this O
one O
exist O
in O
Paris... O

In O
fact, O
it's O
an O
original O
place B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
your O
birthday... O

We O
were O
a O
table O
of O
15 O
on O
a O
Friday O
night, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
terrible, O
cold O
dishes, B-TARGET
not O
friendly, O
restaurant B-TARGET
so O
dark O
that O
we O
can O
not O
see O
what O
we O
eat O
(I O
understand O
why O
now O
...) O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
accuse O
his O
customers O
of O
not O
paying O
(whereas O
it O
is O
his O
job O
to O
calculate O
correctly...) O
the O
manager O
is O
aggressive O
and O
grabs O
his O
customers O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
they O
have O
not O
paid O
.... O

In O
short O
15 O
people O
who O
will O
not O
come O
back O
.... O

Microwaved O
food, B-TARGET
slow O
service, B-TARGET
but O
above O
all O
very O
excessive O
price O
considering O
the O
rather O
average O
quality. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
avoid. O

Positive: O
smiling O
welcome, B-TARGET
nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
charming O
setting B-TARGET

Negative: O
the O
content O
of O
the O
plate B-TARGET

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
short, O
which O
can O
be O
an O
advantage O
(high O
turnover O
and O
therefore O
freshness O
of O
the O
products) O
but O
is O
a O
disadvantage O
when O
there O
are O
missing O
products B-TARGET
(truffles O
that O
day), O
so O
the O
choice O
is O
limited. O

We O
had O
the O
mistake O
of O
choosing O
a O
burger B-TARGET
and O
a O
fish B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chips, I-TARGET
a O
fatal O
error: O
average O
burger, O
soft O
and O
fatty O
fries, B-TARGET
as O
for O
the O
fish O
and O
chips, O
we O
had O
the O
impression O
that O
we O
were O
only O
eating O
greasy O
fried O
batter. O

The O
tropézienne B-TARGET
pie, I-TARGET
although O
delicious, O
was O
not O
enough O
to O
make O
up O
for O
this O
failed O
lunch. O

One O
should O
have O
been O
wary O
of O
the O
almost O
empty O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
a O
Friday O
night. O

Under O
the O
pretext O
of O
inventory, O
half O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
starters B-TARGET
and O
wines B-TARGET
were O
missing. O

One O
had O
cold O
during O
all O
the O
meal. O

The O
toilets O
are O
dirty O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
casual O
as O
possible. O

What O
a O
disappointment! O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
all O
the O
same O
good O
but O
thin. O

Big O
disappointment, O
mediocre O
reception. B-TARGET

We O
asked O
for O
a O
change O
of O
seat O
because O
we O
were O
close O
to O
the O
door, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
answer. O

We O
had O
the O
impression O
to O
deranger O
because O
he O
said O
to O
his O
colleague O
"Pff O
they O
want O
to O
change O
place". O

Very O
dry O
chicken O
and O
cold O
fries B-TARGET
for O
15,50 O
€ O
+ O
very O
dry O
grilled B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
rice B-TARGET
for O
16,50 O
€. O

Also O
note O
that O
the O
quantities O
are O
not O
the O
same O
between O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
a O
la O
carte O
dish. O

This O
was O
the O
1st O
and O
last O
time. O

It O
is O
a O
shame O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
flee O
absolutely. O

42€ O
for O
two O
glasses B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
- O
barely O
passable O
- O
without O
having O
given O
us O
the O
menu, O
of O
course. O

Unfriendly O
waiters. B-TARGET

Wobbly O
chairs O
and O
a O
depressing O
interior. B-TARGET

No O
need O
to O
say O
more, O
this O
bar B-TARGET
is O
awful O

Old-fashioned O
decoration, B-TARGET
dirty O
and O
fatty O
menus, B-TARGET
a O
non-existent O
service, B-TARGET
a O
warm O
beer B-TARGET
which O
was O
not O
even O
changed, O
overcooked O
meats B-TARGET
(accompanied O
by O
pears!!) O
and O
limited O
spoiled O
... O

In O
short O
a O
scandal O
!!! O
To O
avoid O
!!! O

Very O
good O
bistro. B-TARGET

Very O
very O
nice O
welcome B-TARGET
!!! O
We O
ate O
very O
well O
with O
traditional O
dishes B-TARGET
as O
at O
home, O
the O
quality O
but O
also O
the O
quantity O
are O
in O
rdv!!! O

Bistro B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
especially O
if O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
moment O
in O
Montmartre O
without O
being O
in O
the O
crowd O
of O
restaurants O
for O
tourists O
!!! O

But O
think O
to O
reserve O
because O
there O
are O
not O
many O
places O
and O
the O
bistro B-TARGET
fills O
up O
quickly O
!!! O

I O
had O
rarely O
seen O
that O

The O
veal B-TARGET
was O
so O
old O
..... O
that O
it O
looked O
like O
bad O
rare O
beef... O

The O
ham B-TARGET
was O
shriveled O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
sticky O

The O
cream B-TARGET
was O
frozen O
and O
tasteless O

and O
they O
dare O
to O
call O
it O
Escalope O
Saltimbocca... O

At O
18 O
euros O
90 O
it's O
a O
steal O

The O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
rosé I-TARGET
must O
have O
come O
from O
a O
cubicle O
bottom O

As O
for O
the O
service B-TARGET
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
talk O
about O
it O

Not O
a O
smile, O
not O
a O
kind O
word O

We O
have O
to O
make O
them O
eat O
the O
restaurant's O
food..... B-TARGET

Avoid O
at O
all O
costs O

In O
the O
area, O
for O
the O
price O
of O
a O
dish O
you O
will O
have O
a O
complete O
meal O
with O
a O
smile O

Very O
disappointing O
despite O
a O
very O
good O
location. B-TARGET

The O
waiter B-TARGET
is O
not O
nice O
at O
all O
with O
a O
very O
black O
humor O
and O
no O
thanks O
or O
nothing O
when O
leaving. O

The O
service O
is O
much O
too O
fast O
to O
be O
done O
directly. O

The O
salmon B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
fresh O
and O
the O
turkey B-TARGET
not O
cooked O
enough. O

The O
homemade B-TARGET
desserts I-TARGET
are O
apparently O
correct. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
in O
this O
small O
restaurant O
with O
a O
sober O
and O
elegant O
decoration. B-TARGET

The O
20 B-TARGET
euro I-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
are O
served O
at O
lunchtime O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
include O
starter O
+ O
main O
course O
+ O
dessert. O

We O
went O
there O
for O
lunch O
with O
colleagues O
and O
it O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
efficient O
and O
the O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

You O
can O
also O
take O
the O
more O
sophisticated O
34 O
euro O
menu B-TARGET
or O
choose O
the O
a O
la O
carte O
menu. O

A O
real O
luxury: O
a O
quiet O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Paris! O

Of O
course O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
not O
great, O
the O
price O
is O
not O
particularly O
cheap, O
but O
when O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
and O
you O
want O
to O
have O
lunch O
outside O
and O
hear O
yourself O
talk O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
appreciable. O

Average B-TARGET
reception, I-TARGET
one O
has O
the O
impression O
to O
annoy O
the O
personnel. O

We O
settle O
down O
at O
a O
table, O
they O
ask O
us O
to O
move. O

We O
choose O
our O
menu, O
the O
carpaccio B-TARGET
comes O
from O
subway O
it O
is O
certain O
and O
French O
fries B-TARGET
are O
not O
fresh. O

Without O
speaking O
about O
the O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
which O
has O
nothing O
of O
a O
mousse. O

But O
rather O
of O
a O
pasty O
thing O
too O
sweet. O

Carafe O
of O
water O
asked O
twice O
before O
having O
it. O

Small O
plus: O
A O
waiter B-TARGET
offered O
us O
an O
aperitif. O

But O
with O
an O
attitude O
a O
little O
displaced, O
limit O
embarrassing O
of O
a O
rude O
drag. O

This O
may O
please O
some O
people, O
but O
our O
table O
was O
disturbed. O

I O
don't O
recommend O
it, O
there O
are O
better O
and O
cheaper O
small O
brasseries O
in O
Paris. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
in O
a O
pedestrian B-TARGET
street I-TARGET
dedicated O
to O
mass O
tourists O
and O
is O
surrounded O
by O
other O
restaurants O
of O
the O
same O
type. O

The O
animation B-TARGET
is O
painful O
and O
noisy O
and O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
kind O
of O
establishment O
we O
were O
looking O
for. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
mediocre O
(burnt O
fish, B-TARGET
mussels B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
insipid O
desserts) B-TARGET
and O
moreover O
a O
non-existent O
service B-TARGET
plus O
a O
more O
than O
salty O
bill. O

The O
service B-TARGET
in O
this O
more O
than O
typical O
Parisian O
bistro B-TARGET
is O
pleasantly O
good. O

And O
that's O
all. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
disappointing, O
too O
fatty O
with O
a O
not O
pleasant O
taste. O

The O
prices O
as O
one O
can O
imagine O
in O
this O
type O
of O
establishment O
not O
too O
high O
but O
still O
too O
much O
for O
the O
quality O
served. O

Everything O
was O
bad. O

Starting O
with O
the O
warm O
and O
tiny O
snails, B-TARGET
the O
side B-TARGET
dish O
full O
of O
veins O
without O
taste O
and O
texture. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
were O
totally O
absent O
and O
incompetent O
and O
the O
manager O
was O
blind O
to O
all O
this. O

What O
a O
joke O
and O
to O
finish O
a O
bill O
of O
75€ O
while O
I O
could O
not O
eat O
anything! O

To O
avoid O
like O
the O
plague O

Small O
restaurant B-TARGET
typically O
Parisian, O
but O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
delicious! O

Hot O
goat O
cheese O
starter, B-TARGET
followed O
by O
a O
duck O
breast O
with B-TARGET
honey/lemon O
and O
sautéed O
potatoes, O
a O
real O
delight! O

Their O
cellar B-TARGET
is O
also O
excellent! O

In O
short, O
an O
address B-TARGET
to O
remember O
and O
where O
I O
would O
return! O

Very O
limited O
choice O
of O
buffet. B-TARGET

Tepid O
food. B-TARGET

Average B-TARGET
welcome. I-TARGET

Overall O
Average O
... O

Choice O
of O
dessert B-TARGET
almost O
non-existent. O

All O
you O
can O
eat O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
say. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
the O
staff O
was O
not O
up O
to O
the O
mark O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
average O

The O
choice O
is O
limited O
(ideal O
for O
small O
appetites) O

No O
pastries O
for O
a O
brunch B-TARGET
not O
top O
even O
if O
the O
concept O
is O
American O
we O
are O
in O
France O
and O
the O
minimum O
would O
have O
been O
a O
croissant O

The O
staff B-TARGET
does O
not O
watch O
your O
plate O
and O
you O
have O
to O
insist O
to O
be O
served O

The O
only O
positive O
point O
is O
the O
hot B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET

Nice O
decoration, B-TARGET
good O
music, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
quality/price O
ratio...an O
establishment B-TARGET
which O
would O
be O
very O
pleasant O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
not O
detestable O
and O
not O
professional: O

- O
An O
unpleasant O
head O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
gives O
you O
the O
impression O
of O
being O
a O
nuisance O
after O
barely O
setting O
foot O
in O
the O
establishment O

- O
Waitresses/waiters B-TARGET
under O
pressure O
(including O
at O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
the O
service O
when O
the O
place O
is O
almost O
empty) O
and O
of O
a O
rare O
rudeness O

- O
Special O
mention O
to O
the O
barman B-TARGET
who O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
only O
friendly O
person O
in O
the O
place O

In O
short, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
the O
last O
straw O
for O
a O
place B-TARGET
that O
puts O
forward O
its O
New O
York O
influences! O

After O
a O
4th O
visit O
and O
an O
identical O
observation, O
I O
would O
not O
go O
there O
again! O

Let's O
say O
it O
clearly, O
this O
is O
our O
favorite O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Paris! O

We've O
been O
there O
5 O
or O
6 O
times O
already O
and O
each O
time O
we've O
enjoyed O
it O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
considering O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
are O
in O
Paris. O

Last O
Thursday O
we O
particularly O
appreciated O
the O
confit B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
pig's I-TARGET
loin O
with O
gnocchi B-TARGET
(the O
best O
I've O
ever O
tasted) O
and O
girolles. O

For O
dessert, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
inevitable O
lemon B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
served I-TARGET
differently, I-TARGET
we O
also O
enjoyed O
the O
brioche B-TARGET
perdue I-TARGET
... O
Superb! O

Starter, O
main O
course, O
dessert O
at O
30€ O
in O
the O
evening, O
glass O
of O
wine O
at O
8€. O

In O
short, O
whenever O
we O
have O
an O
occasion O
to O
celebrate, O
we O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Last O
point, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
sober O
and O
of O
good O
taste! O

everything O
was O
very O
good: O
reception B-TARGET
- O
decoration B-TARGET
- O
meal! B-TARGET

all O
the O
ingredients O
are O
gathered O
to O
spend O
a O
very O
good O
evening! O

Very O
affordable O
price O
- O
I O
already O
want O
to O
go O
back O
there O
to O
make O
our O
friends O
discover O
our O
favorite! O

A O
big O
disappointment! O

The O
menu B-TARGET
announces O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
dishes O
and O
we O
unfortunately O
had O
some O
ordinary O
dishes, B-TARGET
even O
very O
passable O
at O
prices O
exceeding O
the O
service. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it... O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
mediocre, O
the O
food B-TARGET
bad O
and O
the O
note O
is O
very O
high. O

To O
be O
avoided. O

I O
can't O
give O
notes. O

A O
small O
bistro B-TARGET
in O
a O
nice O
area, O
we O
eat O
well O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

Classic O
bistro O
dishes, B-TARGET
for O
"Parisian" O
prices O
(15-20 O
euros). O

Go O
there O
if O
you O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
or O
at O
lunchtime O
when O
the O
formulas B-TARGET
are O
more O
affordable. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
during O
the O
summer O
is O
very O
nice O
and O
quite O
spacious, O
ideal O
for O
a O
drink. O

The O
only O
strong O
point O
is O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

Very O
pleasant. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
almost O
inexistent. O

But O
where O
do O
they O
get O
their O
waitresses B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
waiters? I-TARGET

No O
professionalism. O

At O
the O
level O
of O
the O
kitchen, O

Frozen O
food O
reigns O
supreme. O

Questionable O
freshness. O
Industrial O
desserts. B-TARGET

Only O
to O
have O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
terrace O
and O
dine O
elsewhere. O

Small O
brasserie, O
nice O
and O
well-stocked O
menu, B-TARGET
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
not O
very O
friendly, O
performance O
above O
all. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
is O
correctly O
served, O
the O
gratin B-TARGET
smells O
of O
garlic O
at O
3 O
meters. O

A O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
served O
almost O
frozen. O

The O
spaguetti B-TARGET
carbonara I-TARGET
which O
is O
bathed O
in O
completely O
liquid O
cream, B-TARGET
the O
reception B-TARGET
not O
very O
pleasant, O
I O
would O
not O
go O
back O
there. O

What O
a O
surprise O
considering O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
brasserie-restaurant O
where O
certainly O
the O
waiters O
have O
kept O
the O
style O
of O
the O
big O
brasseries O
but O
the O
service O
is O
a O
bit O
direct O
and O
the O
cooking O
is O
really O
not O
up O
to O
the O
bill O
because O
without O
moving O
far O
away O
we O
find O
other O
tables O
which O
sometimes O
away O
from O
the O
big O
towers O
remain O
reasonable O
but O
respect O
the O
customers O

as O
much O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
as O
by O
the O
reception; B-TARGET

In O
short, O
if O
you O
can O
avoid O
this O
tourist O
trap O
do O
not O
hesitate. O

In O
this O
very O
touristy O
area, B-TARGET
this O
small O
unpretentious O
restaurant B-TARGET
offers O
inexpensive O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
even O
a O
very O
accessible O
menu. B-TARGET

Of O
course O
it O
is O
not O
great O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
the O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
quite O
honest. O

An O
excellent O
location B-TARGET
with O
great O
potential O
but O
everything O
sucked. O

Huge O
wait B-TARGET
to O
take O
the O
order O
and O
when O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
finally O
comes, O
he O
takes O
the O
order O
of O
the O
last O
to O
arrive. O

Long O
wait B-TARGET
again O
to O
get O
their O
drinks. O

Many O
people O
lost O
patience O
and O
left. O

Waiters B-TARGET
not O
friendly O
at O
all, O
no O
class. O

The O
worst O
was O
when O
it O
was O
time O
to O
pay. O

Since O
it O
took O
so O
long O
for O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
to O
come O
to O
us, O
we O
went O
to O
the O
cashier O
to O
pay. O

One O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
was O
quick O
this O
time O
to O
come O
to O
us O
because O
he O
seemed O
to O
think O
we O
were O
going O
to O
leave O
without O
paying. O

He O
gave O
us O
a O
look O
that O
we O
didn't O
appreciate. O

Really O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
horrible O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end O
and O
that O
for O
most O
of O
the O
customers O
who O
were O
sitting O
around O
us. O

Fuyezzzz O

They O
gave O
us O
the O
wrong O
dish, O
then O
when O
they O
changed O
it, O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
cold. O

We O
ordered O
a O
chocolate B-TARGET
moelleux, I-TARGET
a O
dish O
that O
is O
usually O
hard O
to O
miss, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
soft O
and O
had O
no O
taste. O

Service B-TARGET
of O
very O
good O
quality, O
pleasant O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
kitchen! B-TARGET

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
fresh O
and O
in O
season, O
it's O
a O
delight! O

I O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
to O
discover O
the O
other O
dishes O
on O
the O
menu. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
unexpectedly O
and O
we O
will O
go O
back O
without O
worrying! O

Very O
good O
menu B-TARGET
with O
simple O
but O
sophisticated O
dishes. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
really O
nice O
and O
welcoming. O

A O
delight O
in O
this O
area O
where O
many O
restaurants O
are O
traps O
for O
tourists. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it! O

I O
come O
there O
often O
at O
lunchtime, O
excellent O
crepes B-TARGET
and O
very O
large O
choice. O

The O
pancakes B-TARGET
are O
tasty O
and O
very O
reasonably O
priced. O

Friendly O
service. B-TARGET

nothing O
transcendent; O
quality-price O
ratio O
hardly O
average, O
they O
are O
all O
like O
that O
in O
the O
street. O

limited O
cleanliness, O
toilets O
to O
avoid. O

Do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
walk O
a O
few O
hundred O
meters O
further. O

Very O
good O
welcome, B-TARGET
complete O
brasserie O
menu, B-TARGET
good O
value O
for O
money, O
pleasant O
setting. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
and O
efficient O
service, B-TARGET
we O
were O
served O
in O
less O
than O
10 O
minutes O
on O
a O
Friday O
evening O
at O
8pm. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
my O
butcher's B-TARGET
piece I-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
tender, O
and O
my O
panna B-TARGET
cotta I-TARGET
delicious. O

Obviously O
it's O
not O
a O
gastronomic O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
that's O
not O
what O
we O
ask O
for! O

Simple O
but O
good O
products B-TARGET
(fried O
eggs, O
roasted O
tomatoes O
and O
bacon), O
then O
successful O
home-made O
cheesecake. B-TARGET

The O
downside O
was O
the O
wait B-TARGET
and O
the O
friendly O
but O
a O
bit O
overwhelmed O
waiters B-TARGET

Quality O
meal B-TARGET
and O
home-made, O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money, O
just O
next O
to O
the O
Eiffel O
Tower. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
reception. B-TARGET

I O
tend O
to O
have O
apprioris O
on O
the O
meals B-TARGET
in O
the O
brasseries O
but O
we O
were O
satisfied. O

Frozen O
food, B-TARGET
of O
bad O
quality. O

Poor O
cooking O
of O
food. B-TARGET

No O
manager O
in O
the O
restaurant O
to O
answer O
our O
requests. O

However O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O

I O
loved O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Small O
and O
warm, O
we O
ate O
very O
well! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
TOP, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
was O
great, O
our O
dish B-TARGET
was O
excellent! O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone! O

We O
stopped O
by O
chance O
in O
front O
of O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
doesn't O
look O
like O
much O
from O
the O
outside. O

What O
a O
pleasant O
surprise! O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
nicely O
presented O
and O
very O
good. O

The O
whole O
was O
original O
without O
being O
pretentious, O
for O
a O
very O
correct O
sum. O

The O
prices O
are O
above O
the O
Parisian O
average O
for O
a O
service O
that O
is O
just O
as O
ordinary. O

The O
significant O
drawback, O
as O
others O
have O
confirmed O
in O
the O
comments, O
is O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
..... O
NOT O
A O
SMILE. O

. O
nothing. O

. O
served O
with O
a O
slingshot! O

Not O
a O
thank O
you O
... O
what O
a O
sadness. O

So O
in O
case O
of O
absolute O
necessity O
only O
for O
survival O
otherwise O
look O
in O
the O
immediate O
vicinity. O

To O
meet O
much O
nicer O
people. O

A O
catastrophe O
to O
be O
avoided O
absolutely. O

We O
went O
there O
before O
a O
show, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
overworked O
and O
unpleasant, O
a O
real O
Parisian O
cliché! O

A O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
had O
served O
twice O
the O
order O
to O
a O
neighboring O
table O
just O
yelled O
at O
his O
customers. O

As O
for O
us, O
our O
passage O
through O
the O
toilets O
was O
memorable, O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting O
(giant O
room, O
4 O
toilets O
for O
everyone, O
well O
done), O
a O
nauseating O
smell O
and O
frankly O
a O
cleanliness O
more O
than O
limit. O

Then, O
going O
back O
up O
to O
the O
room, O
a O
waiter, B-TARGET
annoyed O
to O
hear O
us O
say O
"there O
are O
no O
towels O
to O
wipe O
your O
hands O
downstairs", O
tripped O
my O
husband, O
who O
almost O
sprawled O
on O
the O
floor. O

A O
useless O
aggression O
that O
spoiled O
our O
evening. O

In O
short, O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
there. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
setting! B-TARGET

But O
above O
all, O
fresh O
products, B-TARGET
finally O
real O
fries B-TARGET
that O
are O
not O
soaked O
in O
oil, O
fresh O
salad B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
little O
dessert! B-TARGET

To O
be O
recommended. O

Personally O
I O
had O
taken O
the O
tournedos O
at O
16 O
euros. O

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money! O

The O
only O
good O
point O
is O
the O
very O
nice O
setting. B-TARGET

Even O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
winter O
we O
were O
able O
to O
eat O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
thanks O
to O
the O
outside O
heating. O

Otherwise O
it's O
simple O
everything O
that O
is O
not O
prepared O
is O
good, O
the O
rest O
without O
flavor. O

Cocktail B-TARGET
too O
sweet O
vs O
good O
wine. B-TARGET

Plateau B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
cold O
cuts O
very O
good O
vs O
Bruchetas B-TARGET
and O
pasta B-TARGET
without O
taste. O

But O
worst O
of O
all O
our O
dishes O
arrived O
before O
the O
appetizer, O
so O
we O
reported O
that O
we O
had O
not O
had O
the O
appetizer. O

So O
our O
appetizers O
arrived O
and O
then O
our O
dishes O
after O
a O
very O
long O
wait B-TARGET
while O
it O
was O
the O
plates O
that O
arrived O
too O
early O
that O
they O
reheated... O
Cold O
pasta B-TARGET
on O
top O
and O
smoking O
underneath O
= O
microwave. O

A O
bread B-TARGET
that O
was O
watery O
= O
microwave. O

So O
they O
didn't O
bother O
to O
remake O
our O
plates. O

In O
short, O
the O
prepared B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
not O
good O
and O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
the O
customers. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
ordinary O
in O
a O
"bon O
chic O
bon O
genre" O
setting. B-TARGET

The O
wines B-TARGET
are O
very O
expensive. O

The O
maitre B-TARGET
d' I-TARGET
is O
contemptuous O
and O
rude. O

To O
flee O
absolutely! O

We O
went O
there O
last O
night O
and O
we O
were O
more O
than O
disappointed. O

Terrible O
service, B-TARGET
mediocre O
meats B-TARGET
and O
very O
expensive O
bill! O

To O
be O
avoided O
urgently! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
enjoy O
yourself O
from O
the O
appetizer O
to O
the O
dessert O
don't O
hesitate O
to O
push O
the O
door O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
table O
upstairs. O

For O
the O
connoisseurs O
of O
desserts, O
you O
should O
especially O
take O
the O
mille B-TARGET
fleuilles I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
fruit. I-TARGET

You O
can't O
lick O
the O
plate O
because O
it's O
not O
done, O
but O
you'll O
be O
sorry O
if O
your O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
finished. O

Do O
not O
trust O
the O
empty O
entrance, O
everything O
happens O
on O
the O
floor. O

Beautiful O
decoration, B-TARGET
low I-TARGET
lighting, I-TARGET
relaxed O
reception. B-TARGET

We O
tested O
the O
tasting O
menu O
at O
70€. O

It O
includes O
8 O
surprise O
dishes O
and O
an O
amuse-bouche. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast. O

The O
small O
quantities O
of O
starters B-TARGET
are O
frustrating, O
because O
the O
flavors O
are O
excellent O
but O
they O
are O
well O
proportioned O
to O
reach O
the O
dessert. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
in O
season. O

The O
chef O
masters O
the O
mixtures O
of O
tastes O
and O
textures. O

It O
may O
lack O
a O
little O
originality O
but O
we O
enjoy O
it O
all O
the O
same. O

A O
good O
French B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
in O
this O
restaurant, O
a O
very O
warm O
place, B-TARGET
a O
good O
service, B-TARGET
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for? O

I O
would O
return O
with O
great O
pleasure O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Parisian B-TARGET
brasserie I-TARGET
of O
district O
no O
more O
nor O
less. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
correct O
as O
well O
as O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Nothing O
negative O
to O
say O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
not O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary. O

We O
were O
there O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

Deco B-TARGET
not O
bad, O
music B-TARGET
for O
the O
30/40 O
years O
old O
rather O
nice. O

Good O
cocktails B-TARGET
and O
very O
nice O
barman. B-TARGET

Choice O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
very O
classic, O
and O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes O
mediocre. O

Service B-TARGET
very O
perfectible O
(slow, O
and O
badly O
organized). O

I O
won't O
go O
back O
except O
for O
a O
drink O
I O
think. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located, O
close O
to O
the O
Sacré B-TARGET
Coeur. I-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
pleasant O
but O
is O
fast! O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
capricioza I-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
not O
exceptional. O

For O
the O
salad, B-TARGET
my O
friend O
had O
taken O
a O
salad, O
the O
price O
was O
a O
bit O
high O
for O
a O
green O
salad O
and O
2 O
slices O
of O
vacuum O
packed O
ham. O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
! O

Starters B-TARGET
to O
share O
: O
very O
good O
! O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
: O
be O
careful O
! O

Ridiculous O
portions! B-TARGET

And O
therefore O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is! O

And O
taste, O
not O
at O
all O
up O
to O
the O
price O
! O

Disappointing O
on O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
side! O

How O
can O
we O
say O
home O
cooking O
with O
these O
canned O
asparagus, B-TARGET
its O
beef B-TARGET
bourguignon I-TARGET
filled O
with O
small O
pieces O
..... O
snails B-TARGET
thawed O
etc O
... O
French O
cuisine O
really? O

I O
came O
there O
by O
chance O
with O
my O
son O
and O
unfortunately O
foreigners O
came O
too, O
the O
poor!! O
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
mediocre O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
for O
the O
quality. O

To O
banish O
absolutely. O

It O
was O
not O
bad O
but O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
originality O
and O
their O
beautiful O
presentation, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
by O
the O
dishes: B-TARGET
artichokes B-TARGET
in O
boxes O
(the O
boxes O
are O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
stairs...), O
meat B-TARGET
a O
little O
too O
cooked, O
expensive O
wines. B-TARGET

That O
said, O
the O
good O
mood O
of O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
and O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
make O
up O
for O
this O
mixed O
opinion. O

We've O
been O
coming O
here O
several O
times O
and O
we're O
never O
disappointed, O
nor O
the O
relatives O
we O
bring. O

Their O
couscous B-TARGET
is O
really O
excellent. O

The O
meatballs B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
the O
lamb B-TARGET
brochettes I-TARGET
too. O

Two O
kinds O
of O
vegetable O
mixes O
are O
offered O
as O
side O
dishes. O

The B-TARGET
chef's I-TARGET
suggestion I-TARGET
changes O
regularly O
and O
the O
latest O
one, O
couscous B-TARGET
mechoui I-TARGET
is O
particularly O
good. O

Not O
to O
spoil O
anything, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
attentive. O

To O
test O
absolutely O
and O
come O
while O
being O
very O
very O
hungry! O

The O
tapas B-TARGET
are O
excellent...The O
cold O
cuts B-TARGET
are O
also O
of O
good O
quality. O

Everything O
gave O
us O
desire...Nothing O
to O
say! O

Pleasant O
service B-TARGET
what O
is O
more. O

Good O
small O
address! B-TARGET

Neither O
brewery O
nor O
restaurant. O

A O
simple O
neighborhood O
café B-TARGET
that O
improvises O
itself O
as O
a O
restaurant. O

Insipid O
salads B-TARGET
and O
reheated O
dishes B-TARGET
(badly). O

Non-existent O
wine B-TARGET
list. O

Industrial O
desserts. B-TARGET

One O
has O
the O
impression O
that O
everything O
is O
improvised, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
competence O
neither O
at O
the O
level O
of O
reception, B-TARGET
nor O
at O
the O
level O
of O
service, B-TARGET
nor O
at O
the O
level O
of O
cooking B-TARGET
(frozen O
dishes). B-TARGET

The O
noise O
level O
is O
much O
too O
high O
for O
a O
restaurant. O

Too O
bad O
for O
them, O
we O
don't O
want O
to O
renew O
the O
experience. O

the O
worst O
culinary O
experience O
in O
Paris, O
with O
an O
astronomical O
bill: O
lobster B-TARGET
ravioli I-TARGET
at O
20 O
euros O
(the O
ravioli O
had O
to O
be O
at O
least O
3 O
days O
old) O
then O
back B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cod I-TARGET
not O
cooked O
on O
old O
potatoes, B-TARGET
with O
not O
fresh O
rocket B-TARGET
at O
47 O
euros. O

We O
didn't O
have O
dessert. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
horrible. O

To O
be O
avoided! O

Very O
cold O
reception, B-TARGET
the O
owner B-TARGET
is O
very O
unpleasant O
and O
aggressive. O

We O
had O
the O
impression O
to O
disturb O
her O
by O
asking O
for O
mayonnaise O
or O
mustard. O

The O
slab B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
rump I-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
ordered O
in O
point O
was O
too O
much O
cooked, O
we O
found O
a O
hair O
in O
a O
hamburger O
what O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
shock O
them. O

The O
rosé B-TARGET
was O
lukewarm. O

We O
will O
not O
return O
there O
and O
will O
not O
make O
them O
publicity O

Obviously O
this O
restaurant O
preferred O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
setting B-TARGET
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
the O
cuisine! B-TARGET

Burger B-TARGET
too O
dry, O
badly O
cooked, O
fries B-TARGET
with O
no O
taste O
except O
oil, O
warm O
beer... B-TARGET
The O
service B-TARGET
was O
quite O
nice O
and O
seemed O
almost O
more O
sorry O
than O
us O
for O
the O
total O
wreck O
of O
this O
evening. O

Definitely O
to O
be O
avoided. O

Ah! O

I O
forgot: O
if O
you O
find O
your O
14,50€ O
cheeseburger B-TARGET
too O
dry, O
you O
could O
have O
added O
a O
leaf O
of O
salad O
or O
a O
pickle... O
charged O
0,50€! O

All O
is O
said. O

Curtain. O

A O
croque B-TARGET
monsieur I-TARGET
without O
fries O
with O
salad B-TARGET
in O
a O
bag, O
obviously O
without O
flavor... O

I O
do O
not O
speak O
to O
you O
about O
the O
price... O

We O
find O
a O
chewing-gum O
stuck O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
our O
glass O
of O
water, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
does O
not O
apologize O
and O
puts O
the O
fault O
on O
the O
dishwasher... O
we O
are O
not O
even O
proposed O
a O
commercial O
gesture O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
ask O
the O
manager O
who O
can O
only O
offer O
us O
a O
coffee O
(but O
we O
do O
not O
drink O
coffee...). O

Once O
again O
this O
restaurant O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
typical O
Parisian O
tourist O
brasserie O
which O
buys O
its O
low O
quality O
products B-TARGET
at O
"métro" O
and O
makes O
you O
pay O
a O
blinde! O

Poor O
tourist! O

We O
went O
there O
for O
a O
lunch. O

Quick O
and O
courteous O
welcome. B-TARGET

The O
dishes, B-TARGET
well O
presented, O
colorful O
and O
tasty, O
were O
copious O
and O
tasty. O

Original O
and O
light O
desserts. B-TARGET

We O
did O
not O
take O
wine, O
so O
I O
have O
no O
opinion O
on O
the O
subject. O

At O
a O
time O
when O
the O
Marais O
is O
transforming O
itself, O
changing O
face O
and O
not O
necessarily O
in O
the O
best O
sense O
of O
the O
term, O
a O
real O
discovery O
tonight! O
I O
confirm O
that O
for O
many O
years O
I O
have O
not O
eaten O
as O
well O
in O
this O
district O
as O
tonight! O

A O
big O
thank O
you O
for O
this O
rich O
modern O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
full O
of O
flavor, O
thank O
you O
also O
to O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
the O
kindness O
and O
professionalism O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
thank O
you O
and O
thank O
you O
again O

Of O
course O
we O
pay O
for O
the O
location B-TARGET
but O
that's O
no O
reason. O

The O
sauerkraut, B-TARGET
the O
main O
product, O
is O
acidic O
and O
is O
eaten O
without O
real O
pleasure. O
.... O
It's O
a O
pity O
that O
with O
such O
a O
potential O
not O
to O
do O
better. O

Correct O
and O
fast O
service, B-TARGET
not O
much O
is O
missing. O

We O
found O
everything O
very O
good O
but O
the O
reception B-TARGET
not O
very O
nice O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
horrible. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
did O
not O
smile O
during O
the O
whole O
dinner, O
she O
served O
us O
the O
first O
course O
before O
drinks, O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
cutlery O
and O
bread O
three O
times. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
for O
the O
quantity B-TARGET
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
so O
horrible O
that O
we O
found O
it O
expensive. O

It's O
the O
perfect O
place B-TARGET
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
forgotten O
and O
ignored! O

We O
don't O
recommend O
it O
at O
all!!!! O

In O
this O
quiet O
area, B-TARGET
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
dine O
outside O
under O
the O
arcades O
while O
tasting O
a O
very O
good O
seasonal O
cuisine. B-TARGET

A O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
good O
advice O
for O
the O
choice O
of O
wines. O

Moreover, O
a O
good O
quality/price O
ratio O
for O
this O
Parisian O
restaurant. B-TARGET

To O
be O
recommended. O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
a O
warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
a O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
lunch B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
at O
an O
unbeatable O
price, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
deserves O
to O
be O
mentioned O
in O
the O
various O
guides. O

Excellent O
dinner, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
waitress, B-TARGET
and O
subdued O
atmosphere. B-TARGET
We O
tried O
several O
starters O
and O
dishes. O
Nobody O
was O
disappointed. O

To O
recommend! O

A O
warm O
address, B-TARGET
with O
a O
cosy O
and O
pleasant O
setting. B-TARGET

Excellent O
tapas, B-TARGET
tasted O
with O
delicious O
cocktails, B-TARGET
and O
to O
say O
the O
least O
original! O

Nice O
place, B-TARGET
it O
is O
what O
is O
sold. O

But O
on O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
organization O
side, O
it's O
always O
improvisation. O

Waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
too O
long O
and O
obvious O
lack O
of O
organization. O

Apart O
from O
its O
location B-TARGET
and O
its O
setting, B-TARGET
really O
nothing O
exceptional O
for O
this O
"canteen"! O

Dishes B-TARGET
without O
flavor O
at O
exorbitant O
prices! O

We O
always O
say O
to O
ourselves O
that O
with O
the O
price O
listed O
on O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
we O
should O
at O
least O
eat O
well. O

And O
well O
NO, O
pass O
your O
way O
and O
do O
not O
enter O
to O
the O
pomponette, B-TARGET
it O
is O
the O
swindle! O

Disappointment O
at O
the O
time O
of O
tasting O
the O
thick O
and O
stuffy O
tab, B-TARGET
the O
calf's B-TARGET
liver I-TARGET
of O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
same O
appearance O
as O
my O
dish, O
same O
brown B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shallots I-TARGET
... O
frankly O
nothing O
exceptional! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
not O
more O
and O
the O
price O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
quantity, O
good O
desserts, B-TARGET
but O
we O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there! O

This O
address B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
during O
several O
years. O

But O
that O
was O
before. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
less O
complete, O
some O
particularly O
tasty O
and O
original O
dishes O
have O
disappeared. O

The O
service B-TARGET
has O
deteriorated. O

No O
more O
smiles, O
a O
cold O
welcome. B-TARGET

And O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
deteriorating, O
all O
that O
is O
less O
and O
less O
digestible. O

It O
is O
a O
pity. O

Here, O
no O
artifice. O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
well O
seasoned O
and O
prepared O
with O
respect O
for O
French O
cuisine. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
attentive, O
patient, O
courteous O
and O
discreet... O

Bravo O

The O
terrines B-TARGET
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
are O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Beaujolais B-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

A O
simple O
but O
tasty O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
good O
products. B-TARGET

The O
entrecote B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shallots I-TARGET
and O
pan-fried O
mushrooms O
is O
a O
delight. O

It O
is O
always O
a O
treat O
to O
go O
there. O

Very O
high O
prices O
for O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
are O
just O
about O
edible. O

I O
ate O
an O
overcooked O
and O
very O
dry O
chicken B-TARGET
for O
25euros! O

A O
shame O

At O
any O
time O
you O
can O
eat O
properly O
and O
if O
you O
stick O
to O
the O
menus B-TARGET
it's O
correct O
and O
at O
an O
acceptable O
price O
considering O
the O
institutional O
character O
of O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

A O
la O
carte B-TARGET
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
but O
the O
choice O
is O
wider. O

Smiling O
welcome, B-TARGET
fast O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
classified O
setting, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
good O
memory O
of O
Paris O

Really O
delicious. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
in O
an O
original O
setting B-TARGET
in O
which O
you O
feel O
good. O

A O
beautiful O
menu B-TARGET
full O
of O
good O
surprises. O

This O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
perfect, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
and O
competent. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
and O
the O
truffles B-TARGET
are O
served O
at O
very O
low O
prices. O

In O
short O
it O
is O
certainly O
one O
of O
the O
best O
Parisian O
bistro. O

Everything O
was O
perfect: O
the O
welcome, B-TARGET
the O
setting, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(a O
pianist O
plays O
classical O
pieces O
between O
two O
"singing O
numbers"), O
the O
very O
fine O
meal, B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
songs! B-TARGET

To O
have O
talented O
artists O
singing O
opera O
right O
next O
to O
us O
is O
magical! O

An O
excellent O
evening O
well O
worth O
the O
price. O

I O
came O
to O
dine O
in O
this O
restaurant O
with O
colleagues. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-TARGET
quite O
,average. O

My O
starter B-TARGET
of O
avocado O
was O
quite O
ordinary. O

The O
dish O
of O
scallops B-TARGET
with O
pasta O
was O
correct. O

The O
dessert, O
a O
fine B-TARGET
tart, I-TARGET
was O
very O
average. O

The O
pie B-TARGET
was O
cold O
and O
not O
particularly O
fresh. O

The O
accompanying O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
was O
okay O
but O
only O
a O
small O
scoop. O

We O
were O
almost O
the O
only O
customers O
during O
the O
evening. O

My O
colleagues O
were O
on O
average O
satisfied. O

My O
neighbor O
had O
his O
kidneys B-TARGET
reheated O
which O
were O
cold. O

So O
do O
not O
select O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
gourmet O
meal B-TARGET
but O
to O
eat O
properly O
without O
more. O

We O
will O
never O
return O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
tasted O
several O
dishes B-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
without O
refinement. O

I O
do O
not O
see O
where O
it O
can O
hold O
its O
reputation. O

So O
if O
you O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant O
to O
have O
a O
good O
time O
and O
eat O
good O
food, O
AVOID. O

If O
you O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant O
to O
be O
seen, O
this O
is O
the O
place B-TARGET
to O
be. O

Apart O
from O
the O
lousy O
food, B-TARGET
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

The O
key O
word, O
authenticity. O

Here, O
the O
French B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
honored. O

A O
table B-TARGET
of O
character O
where O
one O
goes O
when O
one O
appreciates O
good O
things. O

Of O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
just, O
we O
adore. O

The O
friendly O
spirit O
as O
we O
like. O

A O
little O
noisy O
nevertheless O
considering O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
tables. O

A O
real O
treat O
make O
that O
it O
lasts. O

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money O
for O
this O
small O
very O
pleasant O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Impeccable O
service, B-TARGET
the O
owner B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
always O
have O
the O
smile! O

We O
tried O
many O
different O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
always O
excellent! O

Very O
honest O
value O
for O
money O
for O
this O
great O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Excellent. O

From O
the O
starter O
to O
the O
dessert O
and O
a O
very O
nice O
choice O
of O
wine B-TARGET
list. I-TARGET

All O
this O
for O
about O
thirty O
euros, O
and O
less O
than O
50€ O
with O
drinks, O
it's O
remarkable! O

Bravo O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
classic O
decor B-TARGET
will O
delight O
you. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
impeccable, O
both O
diligent O
and O
discreet. O

I O
love O
these O
restaurants O
where O
you O
always O
have O
wine O
in O
your O
cup O
without O
ever O
having O
to O
touch O
the O
bottle, O
for O
me O
it O
shows O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
always O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
you O
to O
serve O
you. O

The O
timing B-TARGET
(when O
to O
serve O
the O
different O
dishes) O
was O
just O
right. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
tasty. O

A O
little O
more O
vegetables O
in O
the O
portions O
would O
be O
appreciated O
for O
our O
taste. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
was O
adequate, O
but O
the O
wine B-TARGET
is O
served O
a O
little O
too O
hot. O

A O
perfect O
lunch! B-TARGET

The O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
are O
impeccable: O
friendly, O
not O
at O
all O
stuffy; O
young, O
generous! O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
the O
service, B-TARGET
it O
is O
as O
in O
the O
plate O
with O
a O
lunch B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
which O
does O
not O
have O
its O
equal! O

Everything O
is O
refined, O
perfumed, O
aesthetic, O
surprising! O

A O
great O
happiness! O

A O
lot O
of O
kindness, O
full O
of O
flavors! O

What O
else O
? O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excellent O
from O
starter O
to O
dessert. O

It O
makes O
up O
for O
the O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
for O
a O
place. O

Indeed, O
the O
evening O
there O
is O
no O
possible O
reservation, O
therefore O
it O
is O
on O
a O
waiting O
list O
which, O
it O
seems O
in O
the O
weekend O
can O
be O
very O
long. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
friendly. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
crowded. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
sign. O

We O
confirm O
good O
Parisian O
table. O

Aperitif B-TARGET
house O
advised. O

Just O
a O
little O
disappointed O
on O
the O
seasoning. B-TARGET

Foie B-TARGET
gras I-TARGET
lacked O
a O
little O
cooking. O

Hare B-TARGET
not O
bad O
but O
too O
crushed. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
perfect. O

Friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Charming O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
a O
brasserie O
with O
a O
very O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
typical O
French O
and O
seasonal O
dishes B-TARGET
but O
prepared O
in O
a O
little O
too O
"industrial" O
way: O
For O
example, O
the O
7 O
o'clock O
leg B-TARGET
served O
in O
a O
casserole O
is O
boiled! O
Value O
for O
money O
a O
little O
exaggerated. O

We O
will O
make O
simple: O

The O
pluses O
: O

- O
The O
sourcing O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
is O
top O

- O
it O
is O
good, O
mastered O
and O
sometimes O
original O

- O
Formula B-TARGET
the O
midday O
TOP O

The O
minuses O
: O

- O
unpleasant, O
gruff O
and O
haughty O
boss B-TARGET

- O
it O
is O
often O
expensive O

- O
The O
"organic" O
"natural" O
wines B-TARGET
are O
often O
expensive O
and O
disgusting O

Conclusion: O

To O
do O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area, O
but O
no O
need O
to O
rush O
there, O
very O
good O
bistros O
are O
not O
what O
is O
missing O
in O
Paris. O

Correct O
kitchen B-TARGET
but O
not O
exceptional, O
slow O
service. B-TARGET

Doesn't O
accept O
luncheon O
vouchers O
or O
American O
Express O
card... O
and O
lets O
you O
know O
it O
without O
mercy. O

Too O
bad O
because O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

I O
went O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
in O
this O
restaurant O
to O
have O
dinner O
with O
friends. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
good, O
for O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
it O
is O
another O
thing... O

A O
sea O
bream B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chorizo, I-TARGET
without O
chorizo. O

Instead O
a O
kind O
of O
tomato B-TARGET
confit I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lemon I-TARGET
simply O
inedible. O

And O
when O
we O
ask O
the O
owner O
to O
come O
and O
taste O
and O
that O
indeed O
it O
is O
not O
good O
and O
that O
she O
is O
going O
to O
ask O
in O
kitchen O
the O
problem. O

Well, O
too O
much O
lemon O
juice O
but O
no O
commercial O
gesture. O

The O
so-called O
homemade O
"purée" B-TARGET
is O
muslin, O
and O
I'm O
not O
talking O
about O
the O
other O
vegetables B-TARGET
which O
are O
boiled O
and O
tasteless. O

I O
also O
find O
it O
regrettable O
that O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
arrived O
cold... O

The O
tomato O
carpaccio B-TARGET
as O
a O
starter O
was O
good. O

The O
dessert, O
a O
strawberry O
soup B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
basil I-TARGET
was O
correct. O

In O
short, O
for O
two O
people O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
rosé: O
86€ O
for O
cold O
dishes, B-TARGET
without O
flavors, O
and O
which O
do O
not O
correspond O
to O
what O
is O
written O
on O
the O
menu. O

In O
addition O
to O
that, O
the O
bad O
faith O
of O
the O
owner... B-TARGET

In O
spite O
of O
a O
nice O
terrace, B-TARGET
I O
will O
never O
set O
foot O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
again O
in O
my O
life... O

A O
friendly O
team, B-TARGET
real O
traditional B-TARGET
French I-TARGET
food, I-TARGET
freshness O
of O
the O
food, B-TARGET
inventiveness O
(pig's B-TARGET
feet I-TARGET
to O
be O
tested O
:)) O
in O
the O
recipes, O
good O
little O
wines, B-TARGET
frankly, O
I've O
been O
there O
4 O
times, O
and O
I'm O
always O
delighted O
! O

A O
few O
steps O
from O
the O
Pantheon, O
we O
think O
it O
will O
be O
touristy, O
but O
no: O
a O
rather O
intimate, O
retro O
decor, B-TARGET
with O
large O
mirrors, O
the O
menu O
on O
an O
old-fashioned O
slate, O
the O
tables O
in O
beautiful O
wood O
... O

A O
very O
good O
address B-TARGET
! O

I O
recommend O
the O
formula B-TARGET
at O
16,50 O
€. O

We O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
strong O
point O
of O
this O
warm O
bistro B-TARGET
is O
its O
cuisine. B-TARGET

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
served O
in O
sufficient O
quantity O
and O
hot. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
smiling O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
pleasant. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
at O
26 O
euros O
for O
starter/main O
course/dessert O
offers O
a O
very O
satisfactory O
quality/price O
ratio. O

The O
negative O
points O
are O
the O
lack O
of O
space O
(the O
tables O
are O
small O
and O
very O
close O
to O
each O
other), O
the O
rather O
noisy O
environment B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
time O
before O
being O
served O
(about O
45 O
minutes O
before O
having O
the O
entrée). O

In O
spite O
of O
that, O
I O
will O
return O
with O
pleasure O
and O
invite O
you O
to O
discover O
this O
place. B-TARGET

I O
went O
to O
lunch O
in O
this O
restaurant O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
December. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
but O
the O
prices O
are O
exaggerated O
even O
for O
the O
area. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
non-existent, O
even O
casual O
and O
unpleasant O
with O
the O
customers. O

Waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
is O
very O
long O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
bad O
which O
spoils O
the O
evening O
a O
bit. O

Too O
many O
tables O
for O
the O
surface, O
the O
customers O
are O
crammed. O

Correct O
food. B-TARGET

The O
meal B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
with O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
finally O
"home O
made". O

Very O
pleasant O
and O
smiling O
waitress. B-TARGET

Menu B-TARGET
at O
25€ O
very O
complete O
and O
tasty, O
unbeatable O
quality/price O
ratio O
in O
the O
area. O

If O
we O
look O
for O
the O
small O
beast, O
can O
be O
a O
little O
waiting. B-TARGET

We O
will O
come O
back. O

My O
best O
Thai O
restaurant B-TARGET
address! O

In O
my O
plate: O
the O
cooking B-TARGET
is O
a O
delight. O

Fine, O
perfumed, O
with O
coconut O
milk O
sparingly, O
cleverly O
spiced. O

The O
welcome: B-TARGET
at O
the O
top! O

The O
alliance O
of O
the O
Asian O
warmth O
and O
all O
the O
delicacy O
of O
the O
Western O
service. B-TARGET

The O
wait B-TARGET
is O
not O
longer O
than O
elsewhere. O

We O
feel O
guided O
in O
our O
choice O
of O
dishes. O

My O
wallet: O
quite O
reasonable. O

We O
paid O
56€ O
for O
3 O
starters, O
2 O
main O
courses O
and O
side O
dishes O
and O
2 O
desserts. O

It's O
been O
years O
since O
I O
made O
my O
qg O
there O
and O
the O
guests O
I O
brought O
made O
theirs. O

Poor O
quality O
cuisine, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
certainly O
reheated O
several O
times, O
hygiene O
is O
not O
good... O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
difficult O
to O
understand O
and O
especially O
not O
very O
friendly! O

Finally, O
we O
can't O
say O
that O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

In O
short, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
to O
be O
avoided. O

Nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
very O
Parisian O
area O
with O
all O
these O
posters O
on O
the O
walls. O

We O
are O
a O
little O
tight O
but O
your O
neighbors O
are O
always O
pleasant O
and O
some O
have O
what O
we O
call O
"a O
head". O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
there O
is O
a O
good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

You O
come O
here O
to O
have O
a O
good O
time O
with O
friends O
without O
ruining O
yourself O
and O
you O
come O
back O
with O
pleasure. O

Well O
I O
have O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service! B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
waitresses B-TARGET
were O
nice O
and O
everything O
was O
very O
well O
organized, O
there O
was O
no O
pressure O
at O
all O
on O
the O
contrary O
they O
were O
all O
very O
cool O
despite O
the O
ton O
of O
dishes O
they O
had O
to O
serve! O

The O
current O
went O
very O
well O
with O
us O
and O
yet O
we O
were O
a O
large O
table O
of O
12 O
very O
active O
people! O

Some O
of O
us O
saw O
their O
lamb B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
not O
well O
cooked O
so O
we O
were O
offered O
2 O
bottles O
of O
red O
wine O
as O
compensation. O

I O
had O
a O
fillet B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
morel I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
it O
was O
delicious O
and O
cooked O
just O
right, O
perfect. O

The O
homemade O
fries B-TARGET
are O
a O
treat O
too. O

Also O
I O
advise O
you O
to O
try O
the O
mojito, B-TARGET
a O
big O
glass O
for O
5€, O
very O
good. O

We O
came O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
full, O
even O
on O
the O
terrace, O
so O
a O
tip: O
book O
in O
advance! O

For O
most O
of O
us, O
we O
found O
our O
HQ O
on O
the O
quai O
de O
seine O
! O

A O
welcoming O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
chef B-TARGET
and O
his B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
very O
nice O
and O
smiling. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
relaxed O
and O
cosy O
at O
the O
same O
time... O

If O
I O
had O
lived O
in O
the O
district, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
strong O
chances O
for O
me O
to O
make O
it O
my O
evening O
canteen. O

A O
bistro O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
very O
careful, O
some O
traditional B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
excellently O
revisited. O

The O
pot B-TARGET
au I-TARGET
feu I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
cheeks I-TARGET
is O
to O
die O
for! O

Delicious O
to O
the O
palate, O
they O
are O
also O
very O
pleasant O
to O
the O
sight. O

Bravo! O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
dirty, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
industrial O
and O
of O
very O
poor O
quality, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
friendly, O
nothing O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
acceptable. O

To O
flee. O

We O
went O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
some O
friends, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
warm, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
very O
nice. O

The O
couscous B-TARGET
and O
tajines B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
accompanied O
by O
a O
good O
Moroccan B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
the O
sympathy O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
and O
mint O
tea, B-TARGET
a O
very O
pleasant O
evening. O

A O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

We O
went O
there O
on O
May O
14 O
with O
our O
son. O

Good O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
nothing O
extraordinary, O
monkfish, O
guinea O
fowl O
... O

A O
children's B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
with O
only O
one O
choice O
of O
dish O
and O
no O
possibility O
to O
have O
something O
else, O
we O
had O
to O
order O
the O
guinea O
fowl B-TARGET
much O
too O
copious O
for O
a O
child O
of O
8 O
years O
old O
which O
nou O
sa O
been O
counted O
in O
adult O
dish O
at O
25 O
euros! O

A O
very O
expensive O
fowl! B-TARGET

In O
short, O
140 O
euros O
for O
3 O
people O
with O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine O
and O
a O
lemonade O
is O
too O
much O
for O
a O
very O
simple O
lunch. B-TARGET

Average O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
who, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
is O
not O
a O
professional. O

The O
Breton O
boss B-TARGET
is, O
him, O
nice! O

Very O
friendly, O
it's O
more O
than O
a O
restaurant, O
we O
feel O
like O
a O
family. O

A O
meal B-TARGET
and O
a O
wine B-TARGET
irreproachable, O
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

In O
spite O
of O
the O
good O
will O
of O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
we O
feel O
the O
place B-TARGET
rather O
badly O
organized. O

Indeed, O
between O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
arrive O
late O
and O
those O
that O
are O
not O
cooked O
as O
requested, O
it's O
a O
bit O
annoying. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
good O
and O
of O
good O
quality O
however O
and O
the O
place, B-TARGET
even O
if O
a O
little O
dark O
for O
my O
taste, O
is O
not O
unpleasant. O

To O
be O
improved O
so O
that O
it O
becomes O
a O
real O
good O
address! B-TARGET

We O
frequented O
a O
lot O
this O
small O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
there O
it O
dropped O
a O
lot... O

We O
leave O
with O
a O
hunger O
of O
wolf O
because O
the O
plates B-TARGET
are O
tiny, O
and O
the O
bill O
..., O
very O
salty O
... O

The O
dishes O
are O
not O
bad, O
but O
there O
is O
so O
much O
better O
in O
the O
district O
as O
Thai O
restaurant! O

To O
be O
avoided O
if O
you O
care O
about O
your O
wallet...! O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
for O
sure O
and O
that's O
all O
I O
can O
write O
about. O

A O
non-existent O
and O
totally O
disorganized O
service; B-TARGET
a O
boss B-TARGET
who O
spends O
more O
time O
chatting O
with O
his O
friends O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
restaurant O
rather O
than O
doing O
his O
job. O

An O
atmosphere B-TARGET
which O
wants O
to O
be O
bobo O
/ O
Parisian O
but O
then O
rather O
on O
the O
decline O
considering O
the O
panel O
(old) O
of O
the O
room. O

As O
for O
the O
food, B-TARGET
it O
is O
horrible. O

To O
avoid O
absolutely. O

An O
excellent O
meal B-TARGET
mixing O
American O
flavors O
and O
French O
know-how O
from O
the O
starter O
to O
the O
dessert. O

We O
were O
5 O
and O
tasted O
2 O
starters, B-TARGET
5 O
main O
courses O
and O
4 O
desserts, B-TARGET
all O
excellent O
and O
very O
well O
prepared, O
especially O
the O
starters. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
warm O
and O
original O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
without O
false O
notes O
and O
friendly O
is O
moreover O
rather O
fast.the O
selection O
of O
wines B-TARGET
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
card O
and O
the O
price O
with O
yours O
;). O

To O
recommend, O
excellent O
dishes, B-TARGET
irreproachable O
quality, O
interesting O
quality/price O
ratio. O

Our O
choice, O
duck B-TARGET
breast, O
delicious, O
cassoulet, B-TARGET
excellent O
and O
lamb B-TARGET
chops I-TARGET
to O
lick O
your O
lips. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
not O
in O
remainder, O
charlotte O
with O
the O
chocolate, O
French O
toast O
and O
coffee O
gourmand. O

Very O
nice O
staff O
and O
good O
advice. O

We O
will O
return O
there O
! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
warm, O
the O
service B-TARGET
"à O
la O
bonne O
franquette". O

A O
good O
value O
for O
money O
for O
the O
area. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
were O
not O
exceptional O
: O
undercooked O
vegetables, B-TARGET
a O
lamb B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
served O
in O
a O
big O
portion, O
without O
any O
finesse. O

Good O
choice O
of O
wines. B-TARGET

The O
romantic O
walk O
after O
the O
meal O
is O
a O
must. O

At O
7pm, O
an O
aperitif O
that O
turns O
into O
a O
dinner. O

Small O
summer O
salad, B-TARGET
simple, O
fresh O
and O
not O
expensive. O

Strawberry B-TARGET
Tiramisu I-TARGET
effective O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dinner. O

Nice O
service, B-TARGET
very O
young O
team. O

One O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
has O
the O
physique O
of O
a O
15 O
years O
old O
child O
;) O
but O
very O
dynamic O
and O
nice. O

I O
used O
to O
come O
there O
often O
a O
few O
years O
ago, O
in O
the O
summer O
on O
big O
tables O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
to O
share O
great O
moments O
with O
my O
family. O

It's O
a O
pity O
that O
I O
didn't O
manage O
to O
find O
this O
spirit O
this O
evening. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
surely O
very O
famous O
but O
then O
a O
long O
time O
ago... O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
remained O
as O
before O
and O
that O
has O
its O
charm. O

But O
in O
the O
plate O
no O
cooking, B-TARGET
industrial O
reheated O
as O
in O
the O
restaurant O
of O
company! O

A O
friendly O
waiter B-TARGET
but O
that's O
the O
only O
positive O
point. O

Go O
to O
a O
brasserie, O
you O
will O
be O
less O
disappointed. O

The O
prices O
are O
very O
low, O
and O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
average. O

And O
as O
a O
bonus O
when O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
steps O
on O
your O
stuff O
and O
breaks O
something, O
no O
excuse, O
they O
bring O
you O
the O
bill O
very O
quickly... O

And O
when O
you O
at O
least O
ask O
for O
an O
apology, O
they O
don't O
give O
a O
damn O
about O
you O
and O
you O
are O
"kindly" O
asked O
not O
to O
come O
back O
(to O
make O
it O
short). O

I O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again! O

It's O
a O
shame! O

Even O
if O
we O
look O
hard O
we O
still O
can't O
find O
any O
positive O
points O
to O
this O
meal! O

Very O
slow O
and O
disorganized O
service, B-TARGET
frozen O
and O
bad O
cooking, B-TARGET
banal O
plates B-TARGET
that O
a O
child O
can O
prepare O
and O
which O
do O
not O
put O
in O
appetite... O

No O
excuse O
for O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
wait. B-TARGET

0 O
on O
the O
whole O
line. O

Never O
again O
this O
tourist O
catcher O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
establishment. B-TARGET

I O
had O
a O
tartare B-TARGET
cut O
with O
a O
knife O
but O
the O
beef B-TARGET
was O
of O
very O
poor O
quality, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
all O
fibrous O
and O
hard O
and O
the O
dish B-TARGET
had O
no O
flavor. O

I O
love O
tartare B-TARGET
and O
I O
didn't O
even O
eat O
3/4 O
of O
it. O

It O
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
bad. O

A O
friend O
recommended O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
us, O
and O
he O
was O
right. O

Very O
warm O
welcome, O
impeccable O
service, B-TARGET
the O
managers B-TARGET
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
just O
wonderful, O
you O
can O
even O
leave O
with O
small O
pots O
or O
ingredients O
used O
by O
the O
restaurant O
that O
are O
sold O
at O
the O
exit. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
really O
friendly, O
it O
is O
a O
small O
paradise O
when O
you O
are O
on O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it. O

By O
misfortune O
I O
had O
not O
consulted O
the O
reviews O
before O
deciding O
on O
our O
dinner O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
what O
a O
mistake! O

That O
obliges O
me O
to O
be O
very O
unpleasant O
for O
this O
opinion O
in O
spite O
of O
my O
conciliatory O
nature. O

We O
choose O
the O
menu O
at O
39€. O

The O
included O
aperitif O
is O
not O
served O
to O
us O
and O
the O
starters O
are O
brought O
in O
hastily O
until O
then O
nothing O
too O
serious O
... O
Foie B-TARGET
gras I-TARGET
and O
salmon B-TARGET
are O
ok O
and O
then O
we O
have O
to O
wait B-TARGET
for O
one O
hour O
to O
get O
the O
dishes O
: O
a O
tartare O
and O
a O
pavé O
au O
poivre. O
The O
meat B-TARGET
should O
be O
of O
good O
quality, O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
selection O
of O
Hugo O
Desnoyer's O
products O
(bad O
idea O
to O
let O
them O
be O
mistreated) O
but O
if O
the O
tartare B-TARGET
is O
edible O
although O
not O
very O
well O
seasoned, O
the O
pavé B-TARGET
is O
cooked O
in O
a O
dry O
and O
carbonated O
way, O
but O
effectively O
rare O
at O
the O
heart, O
a O
feat O
and O
the O
oil O
used O
for O
the O
fries B-TARGET
must O
not O
have O
been O
filtered O
so O
they O
are O
rather O
good O
but O
grey... O

Again O
30 O
to O
40 O
minutes O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
for O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
which O
are O
not O
edible O
and O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
2nd O
bite. B-TARGET
The I-TARGET
apple I-TARGET
pie O
was O
too O
cold O
and O
the O
vanilla B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
cream O
arrived O
half O
melted O
and O
for O
my O
husband, O
the B-TARGET
pancakes I-TARGET
were O
cardboard... O

The O
errors O
multiply O
on O
3 O
tables O
of O
close O
customers... O

Let's O
pass O
quickly O
on O
the O
carafe O
of O
water O
that O
arrived O
halfway O
through O
the O
meal O
and O
the O
wine O
that O
was O
never O
served O
again, O
the O
rave-style O
music B-TARGET
that O
was O
not O
adapted O
and, O
to O
finish, O
not O
a O
gesture O
on O
the O
bill O
to O
make O
us O
more O
indulgent? O

The O
nice O
setting B-TARGET
and O
a O
bit O
of O
professionalism O
could O
straighten O
the O
bar O
but O
at O
the O
moment O
the O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
really O
execrable O

Pass O
your O
way O
! O

Worse O
and O
worse... O
this O
pancake B-TARGET
house I-TARGET
that O
we O
have O
been O
visiting O
for O
almost O
10 O
years O
has O
gained O
in O
decoration B-TARGET
as O
much O
as O
it O
has O
lost O
in O
taste O
and O
quality O
in O
the O
plates... B-TARGET

Pancakes B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
galettes I-TARGET
that O
arrive O
2min30 O
after O
ordering...very O
dry...no O
flavors O
and O
above O
all O
an O
evening O
of O
stomach O
cramps O
for O
the O
4 O
people O
who O
were O
around O
the O
table, O
barely O
20min O
after O
dinner O
!!! O

We O
miss O
the O
good O
creperie B-TARGET
of O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there O
anymore! O

In O
spite O
of O
a O
sunny O
and O
green O
terrace B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
in O
the O
beautiful O
days...DAMAGE O

Village O
restaurant. O

Good O
welcome B-TARGET
but O
service B-TARGET
a O
bit O
long. O

We O
only O
tasted O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
which O
were O
not O
very O
good. O

Very O
reasonable O
prices. O

Very O
slow O
service, B-TARGET
waitresses B-TARGET
without O
smile O
or O
minimal O
friendliness, O
need O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
menu, O
egg, B-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
and O
cheese O
cake O
without O
taste O
and O
sad O
presentation. O

Big O
effort O
to O
make O
on O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
the O
service. B-TARGET

What O
a O
horrible O
memory! O

We O
were O
attracted O
like O
other O
people O
by O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
and O
the O
low O
prices. O

But O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
were O
seated O
it O
was O
a O
disaster. O

We O
asked O
for O
Coca-Cola O
and O
were O
served O
discount O
soda B-TARGET
without O
being O
informed, O
and O
it O
was O
hot. O

When O
we O
pointed O
this O
out, O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
looked O
like O
they O
didn't O
understand. O

We O
ordered O
a O
menu. O

The O
starter B-TARGET
was O
very O
thin, O
mostly O
salad. O

Then O
the O
waitress O
and O
her O
husband, O
the O
cook, O
started O
talking O
next O
to O
our O
table O
about O
their O
son O
who O
was O
sick O
and O
couldn't O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
(of O
course O
they O
used O
bad O
language O
in O
front O
of O
us). O

We O
were O
so O
disgusted O
by O
this O
that O
we O
left O
before O
waiting O
for O
the O
main O
course. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
laughed O
when O
we O
explained O
to O
her O
that O
we O
didn't O
appreciate O
their O
conversation, O
so O
we O
understood O
the O
seriousness O
of O
the O
establishment O
.... O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
mediocre O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
unfortunately O
a O
lot O
of O
foreign O
tourists O
get O
trapped. O

The O
toilets O
were O
dirty. O

I O
noticed O
a O
small O
sign O
indicating O
that O
their O
duck B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
came O
from O
Eastern O
countries, O
which O
is O
a O
shame O
for O
the O
country O
of O
cassoulet. O

This O
sign O
was O
well O
hidden O
inside O
the O
establishment O
so O
that O
the O
customers O
on O
the O
terrace O
would O
not O
see O
it. O

Test O
of O
the O
menu O
at O
9.90 O
dish O
and O
dessert: O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
3 O
millimeters O
thick O
4 O
centimeters O
wide O
without O
taste O
a O
shame, O
desset B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
salted I-TARGET
butter O
industrial O
chemical O
not O
good O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET

We O
came O
for O
lunch O
with O
my O
friend O
who O
had O
a O
very O
good O
memory O
of O
this O
restaurant O
and O
therefore O
insisted O
on O
the O
"topissime". O

We O
greeted O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
table, O
which O
for O
restaurant B-TARGET
owners I-TARGET
is O
the O
last O
straw, O
we O
seemed O
to O
bother O
them, O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
that, O
the O
customers O
were O
clearly O
annoying O
them! O

No O
politeness O
and O
installation O
at O
a O
dirty O
table O
which O
remained O
so O
even O
when O
we O
took O
our O
seats. O

During O
the O
meal, O
we O
saw O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
was O
disgusted O
with O
his O
job O
(or O
maybe O
with O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
at O
work); O
the O
"boss", B-TARGET
in O
any O
case, O
the O
one O
who O
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
higher O
position, O
was O
the O
most O
unpleasant. O

The O
food, B-TARGET
intolerable! O

Dishes B-TARGET
without O
passion, O
broken O
dishes, O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
(rice, O
shellfish) O
very O
dry, O
without O
sauce, O
not O
fresh O
gambas, B-TARGET
a O
poor O
superfluous O
decoration... B-TARGET
in O
short O
no O
taste. O

If O
only O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
could O
have O
caught O
up O
with O
the O
staff! B-TARGET

The O
next O
time, O
well O
there O
will O
not O
be O
any O
here O
anyway! O

We O
came O
during O
MAY O
2013 O
(I O
put O
feb O
2014 O
but O
we O
can O
not O
go O
back O
before) O
and O
I O
post O
only O
today, O
but O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
is O
not O
one, O
made O
me O
so O
hallucinate, O
(because O
yes O
people O
open O
a O
restaurant O
having O
absolutely O
nothing O
understood O
the O
business) O
that O
I O
promised O
myself O
to O
raise O
it!! O
and O
I O
promise O
myself O
the O
next O
time O
to O
leave O
the O
restaurant O
from O
the O
beginning! O

It O
should O
be O
forbidden O
to O
pay O
for O
this! O

It O
is O
an O
insult O
to O
the O
art O
that O
is O
cooking. O

Could O
the O
explanation O
for O
this O
disaster O
come O
from O
an O
unscrupulous O
buyer? O

because O
in O
the O
meantime O
I O
see O
positive O
opinions, O
which O
leaves O
me O
doubtful. O

During O
the O
festival O
of O
the O
boats, O
we O
arrived O
by O
chance O
on O
this O
place. O

We O
were O
seduced O
by O
the O
front O
of O
this O
small O
unpretentious O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
very O
good O
dinner. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
we O
had O
was O
typical O
of O
the O
region O
(goat O
cheese O
salad O
with O
honey, O
cuttlefish O
with O
seitoise O
sauce O
and O
its O
excellent O
rizotto B-TARGET
....). O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
nicely O
presented O
and O
pleasantly O
good. O

We O
will O
return O
with O
great O
pleasure. O

After O
having O
been O
there O
twice, O
I O
am O
not O
really O
convinced. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
not O
tip-top, O
the O
service B-TARGET
not O
either O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
not O
great. O

Indeed, O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
overcooked, O
badly O
seasoned, O
a O
pity O
for O
an O
Italian O
restaurant. O

Too O
bad, O
even O
if O
the O
bread B-TARGET
is O
exquisite. O

Disappointed. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
bland, O
without O
flavor. O

For O
someone O
who O
doesn't O
know O
anything O
about O
Indian O
food, O
or O
spicy O
food O
in O
general, O
it's O
ok, O
but O
for O
the O
others O
you'll O
be O
disappointed. O

It O
is O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

I O
went O
there O
twice O
to O
be O
sure, O
but O
each O
time O
the O
disappointment O
(various O
plates B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
starter I-TARGET
warmed O
up O
in O
the O
microwave, O
the O
naan B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
elastic O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
(I O
had O
taken O
once O
beef, O
once O
lamb) O
filled O
with O
small O
pieces O
of O
fat. O

No O
frankly, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
good O
Indian B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
simply O
excellent, O
especially O
the O
speciality O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
the O
linguini B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crayfish. I-TARGET

The O
owner B-TARGET
has O
a O
lot O
of O
humor O
and O
takes O
pleasure O
in O
animating O
the O
room. O

A O
pearl. O

Everyone O
knew O
it O
but O
us! O

I O
have O
to O
say O
it O
to O
avoid O
you O
the O
massacre O
to O
other O
.... O

However O
when O
at O
20hoo O
in O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
it O
is O
empty O
is O
that O
it O
is O
suspicious O
... O
But O
well O
we O
had O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
tour O
and O
the O
restaurants O
of O
Metz O
was O
full O
.... O

Frankly O
Mac O
do O
would O
have O
arranged O
me O
well O
I O
regret O
to O
say O
I O
never O
go O
there O
but O
I O
should O
have O
thought O
of O
it O
.... O

Fatty O
and O
frozen O
entry B-TARGET
"nem B-TARGET

Bordeaux, B-TARGET
and O

with I-TARGET

(rubber O
meat) B-TARGET
in O
short O
one O

4th O

the O

history O
to O
change O
air O
as O
fast O
as O
possible O
not O
to O
make O
a O
scene O
one O
Friday O
evening O
after O
a O
week O
of O
madness...30 O
euros O
by O
person. O

What O
a O
waste. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
nice, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
or O
head O
waiter O
is O
not O
professional. O

Dubious O
humor, O
not O
at O
all O
in O
its O
place O
in O
what O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
a O
good O
restaurant. O

The O
goal O
is O
clearly O
to O
make O
the O
terrace O
profitable. O

So O
you O
eat O
and O
above O
all O
you O
don't O
linger O
and O
they O
make O
you O
understand O
it O
well. O

No O
explanation O
on O
the O
dishes. O

Almost O
unpleasant. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
classy O
but O
a O
bit O
expensive O
for O
the O
quality. O

It's O
the O
second O
time O
that O
we O
go O
there O
between O
noon O
and O
two O
and O
a O
little O
disappointed O
compared O
to O
the O
1st O
time. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
impeccable, O
pleasant O
staff. B-TARGET

The O
food O
is O
generally O
correct O
but O
the O
duck B-TARGET
is O
too O
dry, O
the O
tiramitsu B-TARGET
is O
too O
espresso O
and O
the O
waffle B-TARGET
with O
whipped O
cream O
is O
too O
chocolatey! O

The O
speculos/chocolate B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
was O
a O
tom O
and O
not O
earthy. O

An O
addition O
a O
little O
salty O
all O
the O
same O
for O
the O
gustatory O
pleasure! O

Quasi O
gastronomic, O
quality O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
lots O
of O
flavors O
a O
delight, O
going O
there O
regularly O
for O
my O
lunch O
break O
I O
am O
rarely O
disappointed O
and O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
top, O
I O
recommend! O

Copious, O
generous O
and O
rather O
good O
meal. B-TARGET

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
overworked O
(due O
to O
success), O
so O
the O
wait O
is O
bearable. O

I O
don't O
think O
you O
will O
find O
the O
best O
burgers O
in O
town O
but O
they O
are O
quite O
good. O

Located O
not O
far O
from O
my O
office, O
I O
go O
there O
quite O
regularly, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
another O
passage O
I O
had O
been O
disappointed O
and O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
remain O
on O
a O
bad O
impression O
because O
in O
restoration O
it O
can O
have O
days O
without, O
I O
decide O
to O
go O
there O
with O
several O
colleagues O
but O
this O
time O
the O
impression O
is O
confirmed... O

Medium O
rare O
meat B-TARGET
served O
blue, O
repetitive O
and O
uninteresting O
starter B-TARGET
buffet, I-TARGET
service B-TARGET
without O
a O
smile, O
first O
come O
first O
served. O

15 O
minutes O
after O
finishing O
the O
main O
course O
we O
are O
still O
not O
cleared. O

No O
dessert, O
no O
coffee, O
the O
note O
thank O
you O
and O
goodbye. O

A O
warm O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
many O
bottles O
of O
wine. O

Very O
copious O
and O
cheap O
meal! B-TARGET

With O
a O
little O
story O
about O
the O
chosen O
bottle O
of O
wine O
excellently O
told O
by O
the O
very O
pleasant O
owner. B-TARGET

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
of O
course O
for O
downtown O
Toulouse. O

Opinion O
+++++ O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
with O
friends. O

We O
found O
the O
prices O
expensive O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
popular O
area. O

And O
no O
extra, O
if O
you O
are O
still O
hungry O
.... O

I O
don't O
recommend O
it. O

The O
boss B-TARGET
is O
only O
interested O
in O
the O
regulars O
(the O
office O
companies), O
the O
others O
go O
after... O

Starter, B-TARGET
main O
course, O
dessert B-TARGET
we O
loved! O

A O
very O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
great O
view B-TARGET
on O
the O
St O
Etienne O
cathedral, O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
welcoming! O

To O
recommend! O

To O
do O
before O
the O
closing O
because O
it O
is O
a O
mythical O
place B-TARGET
of O
Lille. O

A O
little O
disappointed O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
(a O
lot O
of O
mistakes O
that O
we O
should O
not O
see O
in O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant: O
we O
even O
managed O
to O
get O
our O
coats O
and O
leave O
the O
restaurant O
by O
ourselves), O
amazed O
by O
the O
setting B-TARGET
and O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
but O
I O
remained O
hungry O
as O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
plates! B-TARGET

Too O
bad O
but O
I O
can O
say O
"I O
was O
there! O

We O
went O
there O
one O
day O
at O
noon, O
we O
didn't O
have O
much O
time O
to O
eat O
(like O
most O
of O
the O
customers). O

Our O
order: O
steak O
tartare, O
chef's O
salad O
and O
san O
pellegrino... O
cold O
dishes O
normally O
quick O
to O
make. O

... O

All O
the O
tables O
around, O
arrived O
after O
us, O
had O
their O
order O
quickly O
and O
strangely O
for O
us O
it O
drags. O

.... O
my O
friend O
goes O
to O
check O
on O
our O
dishes, O
saying O
that O
we O
are O
in O
a O
hurry O
"I'll O
see O
how O
it's O
going" O
then O
radio O
silence. O

15 O
minutes O
later O
I O
go O
back: O
"the O
next O
dishes O
will O
be O
yours O
don't O
worry". O

4 O
dishes O
later O
still O
no O
trace O
of O
our O
plates. O

.. O

After O
40 O
minutes O
of O
waiting, B-TARGET
we O
decide O
to O
leave, O
very O
annoyed. O

I O
explain O
why O
to O
a O
waitress O
who O
was O
cashing O
up O
and O
there O
is O
the O
cherry O
on O
the O
cake: O
she O
charges O
us O
for O
the O
bottle O
of O
water O
without O
an O
excuse! O

A O
waitress O
will O
catch O
up O
with O
us O
at O
the O
exit O
to O
apologize O
and O
tell O
us O
that O
our O
dishes O
are O
arriving: O
"too O
late O
I'm O
back O
to O
work O
in O
15min!" O

Too O
bad O
because O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
looked O
very O
good O
unlike O
the O
triangle O
sandwiches O
from O
the O
supermarket O
that O
we O
had O
to O
eat O
in O
a O
hurry O
on O
the O
street!!! O

I O
can O
understand O
that O
we O
were O
forgotten, O
mistakes O
happen O
but O
there O
are O
ways O
to O
make O
the O
pill O
pass. O

We O
will O
not O
put O
the O
feet O
there O
any O
more! O

We O
are O
not O
here O
in O
a O
tourist O
restaurant, O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
simple O
and O
sober, O
even O
a O
little O
too O
much O
for O
my O
taste, O
I O
like O
cosy O
interiors O
and O
small O
fuss, O
the O
wine O
list O
on O
an O
A5 O
sheet O
folded O
in O
two O
puts O
me O
off O
a O
little O
at O
first. O

But O
we O
are O
not O
here O
for O
that O
either, O
but O
to O
eat O
kidneys B-TARGET
which O
apparently O
made O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
restaurant O
in O
the O
old O
town. O

The O
famous O
dishes O
arrive, O
not O
too O
early, O
not O
too O
late. O

Really O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
these O
small O
kidneys, B-TARGET
we O
understand O
their O
success, O
even O
if O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
little O
more O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
garnish. B-TARGET

Dessert: O
Chtiterolles O
and O
gourmet O
coffee. O

My O
spouse O
really O
appreciated O
his O
good O
and O
consistent O
dessert. B-TARGET

For O
my O
part, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
specula B-TARGET
cream. I-TARGET

I O
will O
certainly O
go O
back O
there O
to O
eat O
a O
dish O
that O
is O
different O
from O
what O
can O
be O
done O
in O
the O
old O
town O
of O
Lille O
to O
catch O
the O
tourist, O
even O
if O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
few O
euros O
less O
on O
the O
bill. O

Finally, O
contrary O
to O
what O
I O
could O
read O
here, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
particularly O
clean O
during O
my O
visit. O

I O
tried O
it O
during O
a O
team O
meal O
(so O
a O
big O
table). O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
clean O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
correct, O
although O
a O
bit O
long O
(but O
maybe O
there O
were O
not O
enough O
staff O
that O
day). O

I O
appreciated O
having O
different O
cutlery O
for O
the O
starter O
and O
the O
main O
course O
(because O
how O
many O
restaurants O
let O
you O
use O
the O
same O
cutlery!), O

as O
well O
as O
the O
content O
of O
the O
plates. B-TARGET

My O
choice O
was O
country O
terrine, O
carbonnade O
flamande, O
and O
a O
brioche O
perdue O
with O
a O
scoop O
of O
caramel O
ice O
cream. O

The O
starter B-TARGET
and O
the O
main O
course O
were O
quite O
classic O
(with O
a O
downside O
for O
the O
tasteless O
salad) B-TARGET
but O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
good. O

My O
colleagues O
were O
also O
satisfied O
with O
their O
plates B-TARGET
on O
the O
whole. O

Address B-TARGET
to O
be O
tested O
without O
hesitation. O

We O
took O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
gras I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
porcini I-TARGET
mushrooms, I-TARGET
which O
was O
bathed O
in O
cream O
and O
balsamic O
cream! O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
oil! O

We O
also O
had O
the O
risotto B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
scallops O
which O
was O
very O
rich O
in O
cream! O

And O
the O
scallops O
were O
rubbery! O

We O
left O
there O
disgusted! O

Very O
disappointing. O

If O
the O
note O
is O
not O
very O
high O
(61,90) O
for O
a O
meal B-TARGET
and O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
month. O

No O
need O
to O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
mediocre. O

We O
had O
never O
had O
the O
gag O
of O
the O
marinated B-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
half O
of O
which O
was O
in O
salad. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
not O
homemade, O
which O
is O
felt O
on O
the O
taste. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
average. O

The O
absence O
of O
local O
customers O
was O
a O
good O
indication, O
trapped! O

I O
was O
looking O
with O
my O
friend O
for O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
to O
spend O
a O
good O
moment O
while O
eating O
well, O
it O
was O
the O
ideal O
place! O
and O
we O
also O
drank O
well, O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
such O
a O
name, O
that O
seems O
besides O
normal... O

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice: O
we O
recommend O
without O
hesitation. O

and O
I O
will O
return O
there O
with O
my O
lover! O

We O
went O
to O
lunch O
in O
this O
small O
restaurant. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
the O
space B-TARGET
is O
restricted O
if O
one O
wants O
to O
lunch O
on O
the O
spot. O

The O
advantage O
is O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
take O
away O
dishes. O

I O
took O
a O
menu B-TARGET
"galette" I-TARGET
(galette O
+ O
crepe O
+ O
bowl O
of O
cider O
at O
9€40). O

It's O
a O
good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

The O
galettes B-TARGET
are O
copious O
and O
the O
crêpes B-TARGET
excellent, O
fine O
and O
light. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
and O
a O
cake B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
are O
also O
proposed. O

A O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
when O
you O
know O
the O
number O
of O
restaurants O
that O
there O
is O
in O
the O
street. O

Namely O
that O
there O
is O
a O
majority O
of O
restaurants O
for O
tourists. O

This O
one O
has O
a O
good O
quality-price O
ratio. O

To O
say O
that O
everything O
is O
fresh? O

in O
any O
case, O
it O
is O
good O
and O
well O
cooked. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
friendly. O

Very O
good O
for O
a O
small O
outing O
with O
friends O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

I O
recommend O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
stopped O
by O
chance O
and O
we O
left O
conquered. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
extensive O
but O
that's O
normal O
since O
everything O
is O
fresh O
and O
cooked O
on O
site. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
for O
dessert O
was O
excellent. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
price O
of O
wine B-TARGET
by I-TARGET
the O
glass O
which O
is O
too O
expensive. O

Very O
well O
located O
on O
the O
harbor B-TARGET
in O
front O
of O
the O
aquarium. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
cosy O
lounge O
decor. B-TARGET

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
what O
was O
in O
my O
plate: B-TARGET
danger! O

I O
lifted O
the O
lid O
of O
my O
burger O
to O
check O
and O
found O
salad B-TARGET
leaves I-TARGET
all O
wilted, O
not O
to O
say O
worse O
than O
that. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
were O
almost O
pureed O
because O
they O
were O
soaked O
in O
grease. O

Yuck. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
weak O
health, O
don't O
go O
there. O

We O
were O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
fried O
mussels O
and O
we O
were O
a O
bit O
disappointed: O
overcooked O
mussels B-TARGET
(even O
re-cooked), O
dry O
and O
bland. O

Ok O
it's O
not O
the O
season, O
we O
won't O
try O
it O
again. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
and O
the O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
were O
mediocre. O

A O
correct O
menu B-TARGET
but O
not O
too O
up O
to O
date, O
without O
much O
evolution. O

Very O
pleasant O
setting, B-TARGET
mainly O
outside, O
despite O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
gardener O
..... O

The O
weekday O
lunch O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
affordable, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excellent. O

Good O
level O
of O
service. B-TARGET

Exceptional O
setting; B-TARGET
the O
room O
is O
in O
a O
former O
abbey O
that O
has O
been O
renovated. O

I O
have O
not O
been O
going O
to O
this O
establishment O
for O
two O
months O
because O
of O
the O
carelessness O
of O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
which O
is O
no O
longer O
up O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
chain. O

what O
is O
regularly O
missed O
is O
the O
cooking O
of O
the O
meats: B-TARGET
cold O
blue O
cheese O
barely O
thawed O
in O
the O
middle, O
rare O
just O
blue, O
etc... O
the O
chips B-TARGET
offered O
as O
an O
appetizer O
were O
awful: O
oily O
like O
sponges O
and O
with O
a O
burnt O
taste. O

In O
short, O
if O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
doesn't O
get O
its O
act O
together, O
it O
will O
lose O
its O
regular O
clientele O
(people O
passing O
through O
will O
be O
tricked O
but O
this O
is O
detrimental O
to O
the O
whole O
chain). O

We O
noticed O
this O
negligence O
three O
times O
before O
taking O
the O
decision O
not O
to O
go O
there O
again. O

The O
one O
in O
Limoges O
is O
incomparably O
better. O

in O
addition O
we O
waited O
a O
very O
long O
time O
for O
a O
carafe O
of O
water O
and O
the O
sauce O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
accompany O
the O
meat O
during O
our O
last O
try. O

in O
short O
very O
disappointed O
compared O
to O
what O
it O
was O
in O
the O
past. O

only O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
correct O
in O
Q/P O
ratio, O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
uneven O
as O
for O
them. O

Very O
disappointed, O
little O
friendliness, O
I O
think O
that O
hygiene O
is O
not O
at O
the O
rendezvous O
(waitress O
hair O
detached O
and O
greasy) O
the O
cook O
caught O
pricking O
in O
the O
dishes O
with O
his O
fingers, O
very O
dirty O
dishes, O
meats O
cooked O
in O
advance, O
food B-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
bread O
sold O
at O
the O
entrance O
and O
self-service O
in O
the O
room. O

Pass O
your O
way O
it O
is O
better O
not O
to O
recommend. O

Refined O
and O
generous O
cuisine B-TARGET
that O
works O
with O
quality O
products. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant! O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
become O
our O
favorite O
in O
Poitiers, O
we O
highly O
recommend O
it! O

Really O
delighted, O
very O
nice O
restaurant, O
very O
nice O
welcome B-TARGET
with O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
listens O
and O
gives O
very O
good O
advice, O
meal B-TARGET
level O
really O
very O
good O
nothing O
to O
say. O

I O
recommend O
this O
small O
restaurant O
to O
all. O

I O
think O
I'll O
go O
back O
very O
soon O
with O
my O
partner O
this O
time O
because O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
magnificent, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
very O
warm. O

We O
were O
very O
well O
received O
by O
a O
pretty O
waitress, B-TARGET
but O
the O
rest O
was O
a O
horrible O
experience. O

40 O
minutes O
watch O
in O
hand O
for O
a O
damaged O
salad B-TARGET
and O
reheated O
legs B-TARGET
that O
were O
at O
least O
3 O
days O
old. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
dry O
and O
stale. O

Bad O
quality/price O
ratio. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
charming, O
well O
laid O
out O
and O
friendly! O

The O
boss B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
the O
wines B-TARGET
served O
by O
the O
glass O
or O
bottle O
are O
good...a O
lot O
of O
originality O
in O
the O
proposed O
tapas, B-TARGET
in O
fact, O
very O
good... O

A O
little O
expensive O
however O

The O
delivery B-TARGET
of O
brunch O
at O
home O
is O
really O
a O
genius O
idea! O

If O
you O
add O
to O
that O
fresh O
products, B-TARGET
taste O
and O
original O
recipes, B-TARGET
it's O
heaven! O

The O
prices O
are O
also O
very O
reasonable O
(20 O
euros O
for O
the O
highest O
formula, O
delivery O
included) O
and O
the O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
more O
than O
copious. O

The O
home-made B-TARGET
jams I-TARGET
are O
a O
delight, O
I O
advise O
you O
plum B-TARGET
- I-TARGET
fennel, I-TARGET
atypical O
association O
but O
divine! O

This O
place B-TARGET
would O
deserve O
to O
be O
open O
more O
often O
and O
to O
have O
more O
space O
and O
staff. O

Because O
bagels B-TARGET
it O
changes O
from O
the O
usual O
snacks, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

But O
this O
nice O
owner B-TARGET
is O
quickly O
overwhelmed. O

These O
bagels B-TARGET
are O
good, O
little O
choice O
but O
quality, O
and O
she O
always O
has O
a O
smile O
and O
a O
nice O
word. O

If O
they O
improve O
some O
points O
she O
can O
quickly O
be O
victim O
of O
her O
success O
go O
there O
if O
you O
are O
curious. O

Nice O
address B-TARGET
to O
eat O
on O
the O
go O
at O
lunchtime, O
far O
from O
the O
usual O
fatty O
snacks O
that O
we O
get O
tired O
of. O

Great O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
tip O
top O
with O
friends. O

After O
midnight O
the O
regulars O
smoke O
their O
cigarettes O
in O
secret O
at O
the O
bar. O

We O
even O
saw O
a O
waitress O
smoking O
in O
the O
kitchen! O

A O
real O
shame O
for O
our O
group O
of O
friends! O

Place B-TARGET
to O
avoid O
the O
evening O
if O
you O
are O
in O
family O
because O
apparently O
there O
are O
sometimes O
evenings O
with O
theme O
and O
of O
the O
blow O
the O
organizers O
(not O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
place) O
made O
us O
understand O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
that O
we O
left. O

Excellent O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
decoration. B-TARGET

Change O
with O
a O
new O
menu. O

Hamburgers, B-TARGET
succulent O
pizzas, B-TARGET
brushettas, B-TARGET
and O
an O
exceptional O
Milanese B-TARGET
escalope. I-TARGET

You'll O
love O
it. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
honestly O
very O
good! O

The O
chef O
doesn't O
pull O
any O
punches: O
a O
well-topped O
pizza! B-TARGET

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
smiling O
and O
available. O

Only O
downside: O
the O
chef O
talks O
(yells) O
a O
little O
loudly O
at O
the O
waitresses O
at O
the O
slightest O
little O
thing O
wrong, O
a O
little O
too O
strict O
for O
my O
taste O
(I O
would O
not O
want O
to O
be O
in O
their O
shoes). O

I O
would O
still O
gladly O
go O
back; O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
:) O

I O
went O
thereė O
with O
regulars O
who O
had O
told O
me O
good O
things O
about O
it O
and O
that O
it O
was O
not O
our O
disappointment: O

- O
service B-TARGET
much O
too O
long O
knowing O
that O
we O
arrived O
among O
the O
first O
(19:45) O
that O
we O
were O
placed O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
terrace O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
and O
that O
we O
are O
distributed O
at O
22:15 O
while O
people O
who O
arrived O
after O
us O
are O
distributed O
well O
before... O

- O
waiter B-TARGET
not O
very O
careful O
who O
made O
fall O
the O
cutlery O
on O
my O
companion O
by O
staining O
it O
without O

for O
a O

of O

the O
water O

whereas O
we O
had O
suggested O
to O
him O
to O
carry O
2 O
in O
each O
time O
so O
that O
that O
arranges O
everyone O
but O
not O
heard O
what O
makes O
that O
we O
waited O
sometimes O
more O
than O
a O
1/4h O

- O
the O
food: O
the O

good, O
for O

pass O
your O

there O
is O
much O
better. O

Indeed, O
the O
supions B-TARGET
are O
served O
barely O
fried O
with O
whole O
heads O
of O
garlic O
as O
well O
as O
the O
fried B-TARGET
potatoes, I-TARGET
never O
seen O
before O
and O
above O
all O
no O
taste! O

Moreover O
the O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
too O
salty O
so O
they O
needed O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
(see O
2nd O
paragraph) O
- O
The O
desserts: O
frosted B-TARGET
lemons, I-TARGET
nothing O
to O
say O
because O
it's O
the O
usual O
industrial O
stuff, O
the O
tiramisu B-TARGET
is O
served O
with O
whipped O
cream O
and O
custard? O

Never O
seen O
before O
and O
above O
all O
without O
interest O
for O
my O
favorite O
dessert B-TARGET
which O
is O
enough O
without O
artifice... O

- O
the O
limoncello: B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
30€ O
menu, O
served O
at O
room O
temperature O
just O
like O
the O
water, O
although O
it O
is O
served O
iced... O

In O
conclusion, O
for O
everyone, O
it O
was O
very O
disappointing O
and O
the O
quality-price O
ratio O
was O
not O
at O
all O
good, O
either O
in O
terms O
of O
service B-TARGET
or O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
served, O
because O
when O
you O
want O
to O
put O
your O
stamp O
on O
the O
decor, O
the O
rest O
must O
not O
be O
neglected, O
something O
that O
the O
owner O
seems O
to O
have O
lost O
sight O
of, O
even O
though O
his O
father O
had O
understood O
this O
well! O

I O
booked O
a O
table O
for O
9 O
people O
with O
a O
sea O
view O
for O
a O
birthday O
party O
4 O
days O
in O
advance. O

As O
a O
result, O
there O
was O
no O
table O
available O
on O
the O
terrace O
with O
sea O
view, O
installed O
inside, O
table O
not O
installed O
either! O

Wok B-TARGET
thai I-TARGET
mediocre, O
2 O
salads B-TARGET
goat/salmon, I-TARGET
one O
correct O
but O
the O
other O
lacked O
bush O
and O
brick O
leaf! O

We O
asked O
for O
finger O
rinses O
for O
the O
seafood, O
they O
arrived O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
the O
dessert O
with O
the O
excuse O
"we O
were O
out O
of O
them, O
we O
went O
to O
look O
for O
some O
elsewhere" O
surprising O
when O
we O
were O
offered O
seafood O
platters. O

To O
finish, O
the O
strawberry B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
(rather O
a O
mousse O
decorated O
with O
some O
strawberries) O
ordered O
for O
the O
birthday O
arrived O
on O
the O
table O
like O
a O
hair O
on O
the O
soup! O

Once O
cut, O
we O
found O
ourselves O
with O
a O
pile O
of O
cream O
in O
the O
plates! O

Fortunately O
I O
had O
planned O
the O
candles O
because O
no O
particular O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
to O
know O
if O
everything O
was O
fine, O
if O
the O
cake O
was O
suitable O
for O
us, O
finally O
a O
minimum O
of O
attention O
would O
have O
been O
appreciated O
for O
a O
bill O
of O
270 O
euros O
!!!!!!!!!!!! O

Corresponds O
in O
every O
way O
to O
the O
tourist B-TARGET
trap I-TARGET
par O
excellence. O

The O
customers O
are O
attracted O
with O
a O
panel O
of O
photos O
of O
personalities O
passing O
through O
the O
restaurant. O

A O
tempting O
menu B-TARGET
of O
local O
specialties, O
continuous O
service O
and O
exorbitant O
prices. O

Indeed, O
we O
are O
accepted O
at O
3 O
pm O
to O
have O
lunch O
at O
8 O
am, O
but O
the O
waiter O
is O
alone O
at O
this O
hour O
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
still O
full. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
therefore O
extremely O
long O
and O
very O
disorganized. O

As O
for O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
very O
disappointing. O

They O
brought O
us O
the O
lobster O
claw O
when O
we O
were O
clearing O
the O
table! O
The O
coffees O
arrived O
well O
before O
the O
desserts... O

In O
short O
a O
very O
salty O
bill O
for O
a O
very O
long O
meal B-TARGET
and O
eaten O
without O
pleasure! O

First O
of O
all O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
literally O
jumped O
on O
us O
when O
we O
were O
reading O
the O
menu, O
despite O
this O
rather O
brutal O
method O
the O
content O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
looked O
quite O
good, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
accept, O
then O
after O
having O
made O
our O
choice, O
the O
wait B-TARGET
was O
long, O
fortunately O
the O
misplacement O
of O
a O
waitress O
with O
her O
plates O
made O
us O
pass O
the O
time, O
they O
made O
us O
feel O
sorry. O

However, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
correct, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
plates O
were O
set O
up, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
took O
my O
half O
of O
Leffe O
which O
was O
not O
finished O
without O
me O
noticing O
it, O
it O
is O
a O
rather O
dubious O
practice O
to O
push O
to O
consumption, O
I O
suppose O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
take O
another O
one O
since O
he O
didn't O
put O
neither O
water O
nor O
bread O
on O
the O
table, O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
it, O
and O
he O
answered O
me O
to O
wait O
because O
he O
didn't O
have O
any O
more O
bread, O
did O
he O
mean O
that O
he O
was O
waiting O
for O
a O
table O
to O
be O
free O
to O
give O
us O
his O
basket? O

And O
finally, O
I O
go O
to O
the O
cashier O
to O
pay, O
and O
there, O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
he O
tells O
me O
that O
they O
do O
not O
take O
the O
card, O
in O
2015, O
with O
such O
a O
geographical O
situation, O
and O
all O
these O
tourists, O
it's O
the O
first O
time O
I O
hear O
that, O
it O
smells O
like O
a O
scam, O
right? O

So O
I O
had O
to O
withdraw O
with O
a O
waiter O
who O
followed O
me O
in O
case O
I O
decided O
not O
to O
come O
back, O
moreover O
we O
feel O
like O
thieves, O
and O
when O
I O
came O
back O
a O
gentleman B-TARGET
was O
present O
at O
the O
cash O
register, O
he O
was O
not O
smiling O
and O
moreover O
was O
very O
unpleasant. O

It's O
a O
pity O
because O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
I O
don't O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
anyone, O
which O
was O
quite O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
had, O
and O
on O
the O
bill O
no O
SIRET O
number, O
nor O
the O
name O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
chose O
this O
restaurant O
a O
little O
by O
chance: O
parked O
at O
two O
steps, O
we O
were O
attracted O
by O
a O
menu O
highlighting O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
home-made. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
the O
square O
is O
pleasant O
(little O
traffic). O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
refined: O
the O
market B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
with O
its O
3 O
surprise O
starters O
is O
delicious. O

The O
bouillabaisse, B-TARGET
copious, O
was O
a O
delight O
(no O
bones!). O

The O
only O
small O
drawback: O
the O
main B-TARGET
course O
of O
the O
menu O
was O
served O
to O
me O
almost O
cold, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
the O
preparation O
time O
of O
the O
bouillabaisse. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
recommend... O

Restaurant B-TARGET
that O
I O
already O
appreciated O
for O
business O
meals. O

Private O
outing O
with O
my O
wife, O
and O
really O
not O
disappointed: O
very O
nice O
welcome, B-TARGET
good O
table, O
attentive B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
and O
no O
waiting O
for O
the O
order. O

A O
treat O
for O
the O
fish B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
la I-TARGET
plancha: I-TARGET
very O
fresh O
fish, B-TARGET
and O
very O
well O
prepared. O

A O
little O
wait B-TARGET
for O
the O
desserts, O
but O
normal O
given O
the O
number O
of O
people O
(reputation O
and O
quality). O

In O
addition, O
the O
value O
for O
money O
is O
very O
good O
(45€ O
per O
person O
with O
an O
excellent O
wine). B-TARGET

We O
will O
come O
back O
to O
taste O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu...and O
for O
the O
magnificent O
sunset O
on O
the O
bay O
of O
Marseille O
and O
the O
islands. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
exposed, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
of O
high O
quality. O

The O
products B-TARGET
used O
are O
fresh O
and O
everything O
we O
ate O
was O
very O
good. O

We O
will O
certainly O
return O
to O
eat O
under O
this O
magnificent O
plane O
tree B-TARGET
which O
represents O
well O
the O
terrace O
of O
the O
south O
of O
France. O

Special O
mention O
to O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
for O
their O
professionalism. O

They O
know O
how O
to O
make O
customers O
feel O
comfortable O
by O
giving O
them O
good O
advice O
without O
disturbing O
them. O

Never O
go O
there!!! O

We O
were O
expecting O
something O
very O
high O
quality, O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
ordinary O
and O
some O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
bland. O

The O
confit B-TARGET
doesn't O
look O
like O
a O
confit O
(it O
looks O
like O
a O
sausage) O
and O
the O
taste O
doesn't O
follow O
either. O

The O
scallop O
croustade B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
of O
our O
dishes O
(the O
scallops B-TARGET
are O
generous O
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
good). O

In O
short, O
not O
bad, O
but O
a O
bit O
disappointing. O

We O
had O
booked O
in O
this O
restaurant O
seeing O
that O
it O
was O
recommended O
by O
the O
Gault O
et O
Millau, O
it O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
everything O
seemed O
to O
be O
gathered O
to O
discover O
a O
new O
good O
table O
in O
Marseille. O

Unfortunately, O
we O
were O
disappointed! O

No O
wine O
at O
less O
than O
35 O
€ O
a O
bottle, B-TARGET
prices O
that O
would O
be O
justified O
if O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
up O
to O
par. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
was O
tough, O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
was O
frozen O
and O
tasteless. O

Moreover O
one O
of O
the O
guests O
was O
sick O
after O
the O
meal. B-TARGET

Remain O
the O
service, B-TARGET
sympathetic O
but O
a O
little O
too O
relaxed O
which O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
raise O
the O
absence O
of O
quality O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Well, O
we O
had O
a O
bad O
time, O
we'll O
say O
it O
like O
that O
..... O

Unpleasant O
waiters, B-TARGET
you O
are O
not O
from O
the O
area? O

too O
bad! O

Count O
your O
change, O
believe O
me, O
you O
really O
have O
to. O

They O
did O
it O
to O
us, O
but O
we O
could O
see O
it O
that O
night, O
they O
did O
it O
to O
at O
least O
eight O
tables O
that O
complained. O

Well, O
of O
course O
the O
error O
was O
in O
their O
favor!!! O
nearly O
twenty O
euros O
for O
us O
on O
a O
bill O
of O
85 O
€! O

almost O
20% O
!!! O
The O
best O
part: O
without O
getting O
upset: O
"well, O
it's O
the O
tip O
!!!!" O
Nothing O
more O
to O
say O

As O
for O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
don't O
go O
there O
to O
make O
an O
original O
discovery, O
only O
the O
"classic" O
.... O

It O
looks O
like O
what O
the O
restaurant O
owners O
buy O
at O
Metro O
.... O

Coincidence?..... O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
at O
the O
water's O
edge O
is O
nice. O

Especially O
since O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
rather O
pleasant, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
generous O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
really O
pretty. O

But O
how O
fatty O
it O
is! O

These O
poor O
octopuses B-TARGET
could O
have O
died O
from O
an O
excess O
of O
cholesterol O
if O
they O
hadn't O
ended O
up O
on O
the O
plancha. O

And O
hop, O
an O
afternoon O
to O
digest O
them. O

And O
I'm O
not O
talking O
about O
the O
aioli B-TARGET
... O

So O
good O
but O
could O
really O
gain O
in O
quality. O

Last O
remark, O
why O
salmon? O

Aren't O
there O
enough O
varieties O
of O
fish O
in O
the O
Mediterranean? O

Come O
on, O
a O
little O
effort! O

We O
liked O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
former O
team O
but O
then O
there O
disappointment. O

After O
an O
average O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
the O
menu B-TARGET
seemed O
attractive O
but O
when O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
arrived O
it O
was O
not O
up O
to O
the O
mark. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
good O
but O
the O
cooking B-TARGET
remains O
simple O
compared O
to O
the O
prices. O

A O
salmon B-TARGET
tartar I-TARGET
with O
too O
many O
onions. O

A O
steamed O
salmon O
also O
served O
with O
an O
onion O
sauce... O

A O
profiterole B-TARGET
proposed O
XL O
but O
in O
the O
plate O
the O
cabbage B-TARGET
was O
too O
much O
cooked, O
so O
disappointment, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
have O
a O
smaller O
but O
better O
profiterole. O

The O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
compared O
to O
what O
we O
were O
offered. O

Moreover O
there O
were O
only O
three O
tables O
in O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
on O
a O
Friday O
evening! O

But O
what O
happened? O

In O
2 O
months O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
deteriorated O
at O
a O
phenomenal O
speed! O

Total O
disorganization O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
obliged O
to O
ask O
several O
times O
for O
the O
aperitif O
as O
well O
as O
the O
wine, O
to O
believe O
that O
they O
do O
not O
want O
us O
to O
consume. O

An O
interminable O
wait B-TARGET
before O
ordering. O

Normal O
when O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
don't O
manage O
their O
tables...vacations O
come O
and O
go O
without O
any O
logic O
of O
service! B-TARGET

Fortunately O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
makes O
up O
for O
this O
but O
what O
a O
waste O
for O
this O
small O
Italian O
restaurant O
with O
a O
magnificent O
terrace B-TARGET
and O
fresh O
products. O

Please, O
Mr. O
Manager, O
put O
your O
organization O
in O
order. O

The O
person O
who O
greets O
and O
seats O
people O
should O
be O
managing O
the O
service B-TARGET
instead O
of O
walking O
around O
with O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
pockets. O

It O
is O
not O
understood O
to O
assign O
to O
each O
waiter O
a O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
so O
that O
everyone O
can O
follow O
his O
orders O

I've O
been O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
years. O

Well, O
it's O
always O
so O
good. O

The O
formula B-TARGET
is O
perfect. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
always O
cooked O
the O
way O
you O
want O
it O
and O
if O
you O
don't O
have O
enough O
fries O
ask O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
for O
some O
and O
he O
will O
bring O
you O
a O
plate. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive. O

In O
short, O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
come O
with O
friends O
to O
eat O
well O
and O
quickly O
if O
you O
want. O

It O
is O
almost O
by O
chance O
that O
we O
dined O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
positively O
surprised. O

First O
of O
all O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant, O
smiling O
and O
friendly. O

The O
unpretentious O
cuisine B-TARGET
remains O
simple O
and O
of O
good O
quality. O

Balanced O
portions, B-TARGET
except O
perhaps O
for O
the O
starter B-TARGET
(mussels O
au O
gratin) O
which O
was O
too O
small O
as O
the O
mussels B-TARGET
were O
good. O

The O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
was O
quite O
adequate O
and O
at O
a O
more O
than O
reasonable O
price, O
14 O
euros... O

We O
recommend O
this O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
which O
is O
located O
in O
the O
Panier O
district. O

A O
good O
surprise O
on O
the O
port B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Marseille. I-TARGET

The O
prices O
are O
correct, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
in O
quantity O
and O
with O
a O
large O
choice O
(a O
cheese B-TARGET
board I-TARGET
displays O
more O
than O
30 O
specimens!) O

Certainly, O
it O
is O
not O
gastronomy, O
but O
one O
does O
not O
come O
to O
a O
buffet O
at O
will O
for O
that. O

One O
thus O
sets O
out O
again O
full O
and O
happy O
to O
have O
spent O
a O
good O
moment O
for O
not O
too O
expensive O
(on O
the O
port, B-TARGET
it O
is O
rather O
remarkable). O

Certainly O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
well O
located, O
but O
that O
does O
not O
justify O
the O
tariffs O
practiced O
for O
a O
just O
average O
quality. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day, O
as O
its O
name O
indicates, O
is O
rather O
a O
guarantee O
of O
freshness O
and O
quality; O
on O
this O
day, O
if O
the O
wild B-TARGET
boar I-TARGET
was O
decent, O
the O
accompaniment B-TARGET
was O
very O
limited, O
namely O
cold O
and O
dried O
out O
pasta. B-TARGET

A O
decent O
service, B-TARGET
but O
not O
to O
be O
repeated, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
small O
restaurants O
that O
know O
how O
to O
serve O
a O
better O
quality O
cuisine O

I O
know O
the O
address O
for O
a O
long O
time O

but B-TARGET
big I-TARGET
disappointment I-TARGET
: O

a O
rather O
good O
pizza B-TARGET
but O
served O
without O
cutlery? O

A O
draught B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
at O
3,7 O
euros O
without O
bubble O
with O
a O
taste O
of O
water, O
in O
short O
a O
beer O
cut O
with O
water. O

Answer O
of O
the O
waiter: O
yes, O
we O
have O
problems O
of O
barrel O
at O
the O
moment? O

(with O
a O
little O
smile) O

I O
tried O
my O
luck O
with O
a O
beer O
bottle B-TARGET
6 O
euros O
arrived O
opened O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
lemon O
inside O
? O

idem O
without O
bubble O
and O
a O
taste O
of O
water. O

The O
neighbor O
at O
the O
next O
table O
sent O
back O
her O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
there O
were O
so O
many O
ice O
cubes O
that O
it O
didn't O
taste O
like O
wine O
anymore. O

As O
mentioned O
before: O
don't O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom, O
disgusting! O

Waiters B-TARGET
of O
18 O
years O
old O
very O
nice O
but O
tips O
not O
possible O
there O
.... O

Really O
a O
pity! O

We O
must O
absolutely O
not O
support O
this O
! O

by O
masochistic O
spirit O
no O
doubt, O
I O
returned O
in O
this O
"restaurant" B-TARGET
by O
saying O
to O
me O
that O
perhaps.... O
in O
fact O
nothing O
changed, O
null O
service, B-TARGET
with O
badly O
fagoté O
personnel, B-TARGET
badly O
dressed, O
not O
very O
professional.one O
waits O
20mn O
to O
have O
the O
chart, O
if O
one O
does O
not O
take O
aperitif. O

The O
situation B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
detestable, O
it O
is O
a O
tourist B-TARGET
feeder, I-TARGET
as O
is O
the O
place O
where O
we O
really O
"wait" O
for O
the O
tourist. O

Wine B-TARGET
by I-TARGET
the O
glass O
not O
fresh, O
in O
bottle B-TARGET
rather O
expensive O
and O
a O
beer B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
bottle I-TARGET
not O
very O
convincing O

service B-TARGET
of O
canteen, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
carries O
the O
"soup" O
of O
fish O
between O
her O
2 O
hands O
because O
the O
plate O
is O
hot, O
without O
liteau, O
without O
class O
really O

one O
eats O
there O
more O
than O
one O
restores O
there O
to O
really O
avoid O

Attracted O
by O
the O
frontage O
declining O
as O
rather O
chic, O
certainly O
the O
price O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at O
15€ O
did O
not O
inspire O
a O
refined O
kitchen... O
but O
there O
it O
is O
worse O
than O
all... O

Frozen O
food O
but O
not O
good O
frozen O
food O
!!! O
Marinated O
octopus.... O
that O
is O
to O
say O
an O
octopus B-TARGET
that O
looks O
like O
real O
rubber O
with O
vinegar....basically O
a O
simple O
salad! O

Marine B-TARGET
mussels I-TARGET
that O
bathe.... O
in O
their O
water O
yes O
without O
sauce: O
no O
interest!!! O

For O
me O
the O
worst O
remains O
the O
service! B-TARGET

A O
non-existent O
management: B-TARGET
15 O
to O
20 O
minutes O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
between O
each O
dish, O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
serves O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
next O
to O
us O
but O
who O
does O
not O
clear O
us O
until O
10 O
minutes O
later O
... O
and O
the O
must....when O
the O
choice O
of O
dessert B-TARGET
there O
was O
only O
one O
dessert O
with O
red O
fruits O
on O
the O
4 O
possibilities O
of O
the O
menu O
... O
my O
friend O
does O
not O
like O
them O
... O
the O
owner B-TARGET
refused O
to O
exchange O
the O
coffee O
for O
the O
dessert O
he O
did O
not O
take O
..... O

A O
lousy O
customer O
relationship! O

As O
for O
the O
sour O
and O
sparkling O
fruit B-TARGET
salad...I I-TARGET
suspect O
they O
put O
orangina O
in O
it.... O

Why?! O
I'll O
never O
know!!! O

Don't O
be O
fooled O
by O
the O
attractive O
price O
and O
the O
frontage, O
the O
competitors O
practice O
the O
same O
types O
of O
menus O
and O
are O
more O
quality O
and O
more O
pleasant O

Seaside O
restaurant B-TARGET
ideally O
located. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
warm O
welcome. B-TARGET

Nevertheless, O
expensive O
meals, B-TARGET
without O
much O
choice, O
heavy O
and O
very O
fat. O

I O
will O
not O
return O
to O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
even O
after O
10 O
hours O
of O
digestion, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
is O
still O
not O
passed. O

.... O
what O
a O
cold O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
what O
an O
unsympathetic O
service! B-TARGET

Brunch O
lovers, O
we O
went O
there O
one O
Sunday O
to O
have O
a O
brunch O
in O
the O
sun O
on O
the O
terrace: B-TARGET
the O
brunch B-TARGET
is O
served O
at O
the O
table O
and O
not O
in O
buffet, O
it O
is O
copious O
and O
rather O
good: O
there O
are O
eggs, O
bacon, O
sausage, O
pastries, O
salmon O
and O
fruit O
salad, O
cottage O
cheese O
among O
others, O
its O
price O
is O
correct, O
however O
we O
were O
very O
disappointed O
by O
the O
service: B-TARGET
the O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
fast O
and O
unfriendly, O
she O
didn't O
take O
away O
the O
salted O
plate O
when O
she O
had O
brought O
us O
the O
coffee O
for O
the O
pastries, O
we O
ate O
our O
waffles O
on O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
table O
so O
as O
not O
to O
mix O
them O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
sausage. O
...not O
very O
professional! O

We O
asked O
her O
to O
be O
cleared, O
she O
didn't O
do O
it O
but O
passed O
3 O
times O
in O
front O
of O
us O
with O
empty O
hands...it's O
very O
average. O

It's O
a O
shame O
because O
the O
brunch B-TARGET
was O
nice O
but O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
don't O
deserve O
that O
we O
come O
back. O

At O
the O
beginning O
we O
already O
had O
the O
impression O
to O
disturb, O
at O
the O
limit O
not O
too O
serious O
tourist O
city O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
so O
I O
think O
the O
waiters O
tired. O

Once O
the O
meal B-TARGET
at O
the O
table, O
a O
disaster, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
errors O
or O
omissions, O
an O
impression O
of O
rotten O
meat B-TARGET
and O
so O
on O
... O

While O
going O
to O
the O
toilets O
we O
saw O
an O
establishment B-TARGET
in O
a O
state O
more O
than O
laborious, O
worse O
than O
in O
our O
worst O
nightmares, O
dirty, O
dilapidated, O
how O
can O
one O
make O
a O
meal O
in O
such O
a O
place, O
I O
felt O
bad O
to O
see O
that. O

To O
close O
immediately. O

Please O
go O
somewhere O
else, O
thank O
you. O

Under O
the O
sun O
of O
Estaque, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
decoration B-TARGET
(teak O
table, O
slate O
sets). O

The O
big O
plus O
is O
the O
smiling O
welcome O
of O
the O
2 O
waitresses, B-TARGET
who O
are O
available O
and O
know O
the O
dishes O
well. O

I O
chose O
a O
freshly O
caught O
sea O
bass O
with O
its O
ratatouille O
on O
mashed O
potatoes B-TARGET
accompanied I-TARGET
by I-TARGET
an I-TARGET
olive I-TARGET
oil I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
citrus I-TARGET
fruits I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
herbs, I-TARGET
the O
whole O
being O
a O
bit O
insipid. O

I O
am O
all O
the O
more O
sorry O
to O
write O
this O
as O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
joy O
of O
kindness. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
did O
not O
leave O
me O
with O
any O
memorable O
souvenir O
(a O
gourmet O
tea). O

Can O
do O
better, O
I'm O
sure! O

A O
must O
see! O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
fine, O
with O
very O
good O
products, B-TARGET
cooked O
with O
talent O
and O
love. O

A O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
always O
perfect, O
a O
very O
good O
choice O
of O
wine B-TARGET
(even O
the O
jugs B-TARGET
are O
very O
good), O
aperitifs B-TARGET
and O
especially O
to O
test O
the O
cocktails! B-TARGET

Invented O
and O
prepared O
with O
care O
by O
the O
super O
bartender! O

Between O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
summer O
and O
the O
tables O
by O
the O
fireplace B-TARGET
in O
the O
winter, O
the O
music, B-TARGET
the O
setting B-TARGET
combines O
all O
the O
ingredients O
to O
spend O
a O
superb O
evening. O

We O
go O
there O
with O
our O
eyes O
closed! O

Reading O
the O
different O
comments, O
I O
wonder O
if O
I O
was O
in O
the O
same O
place B-TARGET
or O
if O
I O
was O
in O
a O
bad O
mood O
that O
day... O

That O
being O
said, O
I O
did O
not O
find O
the O
staff B-TARGET
friendly, O
certainly O
we O
finished O
lunch O
a O
little O
late O
(4pm) O
but O
we O
were O
pushed O
towards O
the O
exit O
because O
the O
restaurant O
was O
closing O
(what's O
the O
point O
if O
it's O
to O
reopen O
two O
hours O
later?!). O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
does O
not O
leave O
any O
particular O
memory, O
rather O
standard O
and O
for O
the O
price O
in O
the O
end, O
we O
can O
frankly O
expect O
much O
better! O

In O
short, O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
what O
I O
was O
told O
or O
what O
I O
read O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
... O

Tastes O
and O
colors O
no O
doubt O
:-) O

We O
were O
5 O
this O
day O
to O
want O
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
the O
terrace O
of O
this O
establishment, O
with O
its O
large O
choice O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
suitable O
for O
everyone. O

Once O
we O
got O
there O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
15 O
minutes O
to O
order O
our O
drinks O
and O
get O
the O
menus, O
15 O
minutes O
later O
the O
waiter O
came O
back O
to O
take O
our O
order O
and O
announced O
that O
there O
were O
no O
pizzas, O
no O
hamburgers O
and O
no O
cannelonis... O

If O
this O
had O
been O
communicated O
to O
us O
as O
we O
were O
settling O
in, O
we O
would O
have O
decided O
to O
change O
restaurants. B-TARGET

I O
had O
to O
take O
the O
olives O
left O
by O
the O
customers O
of O
the O
next O
table O
(with O
the O
pits O
on O
the O
table O
which O
were O
not O
picked O
up O
during O
our O
wait). O
I O
asked O
for O
an O
ashtray O
to O
put O
our O
pits O
in O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
told O
me O
"you O
ask O
for O
things". O

As O
we O
were O
drinking O
our O
drinks O
we O
decided O
to O
make O
an O
effort O
by O
ordering O
a O
meat, O
not O
seeing O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
coming O
back O
and O
after O
10 O
minutes O
we O
got O
up O
to O
go O
pay O
the O
bill O
in O
the O
tobacco O
shop O
after O
having O
to O
wait O
for O
only O
1 O
cash O
register O
the O
boss B-TARGET
asks O
me O
in O
a O
very O
friendly O
way O
for O
the O
table O
number. O

I O
was O
told O
"you O
can't O
pay O
without O
the O
table O
number, O
I O
need O
the O
table O
number". O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
"mountain" O
type O
setting, B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
true O
that O
the O
smell B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
unpleasant O
when O
you O
enter O
the O
room. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
we O
are O
in O
a O
restaurant O
of O
fondues, O
so O
no O
surprises O
on O
this O
point. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
smiling O
and O
listening O
to O
the O
customer. O

A O
small O
downside O
for O
a O
lady O
who O
was O
part O
of O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
who O
was O
very O
unpleasant. O

It O
is O
still O
a O
good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
to O
try. O

Already O
on O
arrival, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
exceptional! O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
at O
the O
bottom O
left O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
3 O
meters O
from O
the O
sea; O
the O
beach O
is O
on O
the O
right O
side O
(on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
restaurant) O
so O
we O
are O
not O
"disturbed" O
by O
the O
beachgoers. O

As O
for O
the O
cuisine, B-TARGET
it O
is O
delicate, O
refined O
and O
in O
generous O
portions! O

Daily O
fish B-TARGET
arrivals, O
so O
extra O
fresh. O

For O
those O
who O
do O
not O
like O
fish, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
diversified; O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
very O
greedy! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
relaxed, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
puts O
you O
at O
ease O
right O
away. O

The O
whole O
is O
certainly O
not O
given O
but O
a O
dish O
and O
a O
dessert O
remain O
affordable. O

Quality O
meal B-TARGET
at O
very O
correct O
prices. O

Fresh O
products B-TARGET
with O
good O
positions O
of O
the O
team B-TARGET
which O
is O
with O
the O
small O
care. O

The O
small O
more O
a O
card B-TARGET
of O
has O
very O
attractive O
prices. O

An O
excellent O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
home-made O
dishes, B-TARGET
which O
makes O
a O
reduced O
menu B-TARGET
but O
with O
dishes O
with O
an O
exquisite O
taste. O

I O
can O
only O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
an O
excellent O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
good O
cuisine. B-TARGET

A O
bistro B-TARGET
as O
I O
like O
them. O

Here O
you O
are O
received O
as O
it O
should O
be. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
simple O
but O
of O
very O
good O
quality. O

Very O
pleasant O
service B-TARGET
on O
a O
beautiful O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
tourist O
is O
welcome O
and O
here O
there O
is O
no O
scam. O

The O
prices O
are O
reasonable O
and O
we O
do O
not O
force O
you O
to O
consume. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
be O
noted O
during O
your O
stay O
in O
Marseille. O

The O
proximity O
of O
parking O
will O
make O
your O
stay O
cooler. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
define O
the O
setting, B-TARGET
I O
would O
say O
bluffing. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
sublime, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
quiet. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
very O
fine, O
perfectly O
adapted O
in O
quantity. O

The O
problem: O
the O
service, B-TARGET
which O
should O
be O
slightly O
better O
for O
a O
restaurant O
of O
this O
level O
(aperitifs O
arrived O
15 O
minutes O
apart, O
two O
waiters O
wanted O
to O
pay O
us...), O
it O
lacks O
a O
little O
attention. O

However O
the O
staff B-TARGET
remains O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
wait B-TARGET
is O
not O
excessive O
(except O
for O
the O
aperitif, O
therefore). O

We O
were O
regulars O
of O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
guinguette O
which O
was O
at O
the O
time O
very O
pleasant O
with O
a O
magnificent O
view B-TARGET
on O
the O
old O
port O
and O
with O
a O
food B-TARGET
without O
pretension O
with O
good O
simple O
and O
fresh O
products.... B-TARGET

But O
what O
happened, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
become O
a O
very O
expensive O
tourist O
attraction O
without O
any O
quality! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
deplorable O
and O
the O
whole O
restaurant O
thinks O
it's O
a O
3* O
when O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
very O
very O
bad! O

We O
are O
very O
sad O
and O
very O
disappointed... O
we O
were O
with O
people O
from O
Marseille O
who O
also O
found O
it O
very O
bad, O
one O
of O
our O
friends O
was O
even O
sick O
all O
night O
after O
the O
meal... O

We O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there O
anymore... O

too O
bad, O
it's O
really O
a O
waste! O

Restaurant O
visited O
one O
evening O
during O
the O
week O
with O
reservation. O

Typical O
Moroccan O
cuisine, B-TARGET
simple O
menu B-TARGET
with O
all O
the O
dishes O
of O
the O
country. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
ready O
to O
do O
anything O
to O
make O
everyone O
eat O
well. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
(very O
copious, O
and O
served O
again O
if O
needed) O
with O
a O
mint O
tea O
to O
digest: O
12€. O

Not O
to O
be O
missed O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
flavors O
without O
breaking O
the O
wallet! O

No O
false O
note O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
... O

Starting O
with O
the O
warm O
and O
very O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
(accepting O
us O
at O
14 O
on O
a O
1st O
of O
November...many O
wouldn't O
have O
done O
it) O

A O
simple O
setting B-TARGET
but O
nevertheless O
very O
authentic O
and O
studied...an O
American O
style O
from O
the O
70's O
all O
in O
simplicity O
and O
taste. O

The O
heart...the O
meal! B-TARGET

Whether O
it's O
the O
starters...a B-TARGET
very O
affordable O
price O
(between O
5 O
and O
7 O
euros) O
for O
an O
exceptional O
quality/price O
ratio. O

I O
recommend O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
tartar I-TARGET
Thai I-TARGET
style. O

Then O
the O
dishes O
... O
no O
doubt O
the O
specialty O
very O
mastered O
is O
the O
burger B-TARGET
house! O

A O
bread B-TARGET
elaborated O
by O
a O
baker O
of O
the O
corner, O
a O
fresh O
chopped B-TARGET
steak, I-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
the O
fresh B-TARGET
products, I-TARGET
the O
home-made O
fries, B-TARGET
the O
small O
salad B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
a O
well O
raised O
vinaigrette. O

Let's O
not O
be O
afraid O
of O
words...to O
this O
day O
it's O
the O
best O
burger B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
had. O

Even O
if O
it O
is O
a O
trendy O
concept...few O
are O
those O
who O
master O
it O
like O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
to O
fall O
with O
the O
Toblerone B-TARGET
cheesecake! I-TARGET

The O
whole O
at O
a O
very O

We O
had O
lunch O
yesterday O
in O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
view B-TARGET
on O
the O
sea O
and O
a O
very O
pleasant O
terrace. B-TARGET

We O
were O
welcomed O
on O
the O
terrace, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
that O
I O
had O
ordered O
cooked O
blue O
arrived O
"rare", O
not O
terrible O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
specializing O
in O
meat! O

But O
not O
to O
be O
picky, O
I O
ate O
it O
all O
the O
same O
without O
having O
it O
returned O
to O
the O
kitchen O
and O
wasting O
it. O

When O
the O
waiter O
asked O
us O
if O
it O
was O
ok, O
I O
told O
him O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
that O
the O
cooking O
was O
not O
what O
I O
had O
asked O
for. O

And O
there, O
what O
a O
surprise, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
gets O
offended, O
he O
is O
not O
understanding, O
he O
brings O
us O
the O
bill, O
we O
pay O
and O
he O
does O
not O
even O
say O
goodbye! O
What O
professionalism O
!!!! O
considering O
his O
behavior O
and O
his O
young O
age, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
maturity, O
manager O
it O
is O
urgent! O

Considering O
this O
reception, B-TARGET
we O
will O
not O
come O
back O
anymore! O

Restaurant O
visited O
for O
family O
occasion. O

Very O
good O
reception, B-TARGET
discreet O
and O
efficient. O

Good O
meal, B-TARGET
refined, O
in O
a O
good O
timing. B-TARGET

A O
beautiful O
and O
great O
classic, B-TARGET
which O
will O
not O
disappoint, O
whatever O
the O
tastes O
of O
young O
and O
old. O

Good O
cellar B-TARGET
well O
enhanced O
by O
good O
advice O
in O
the O
room. O

A O
bit O
expensive O
for O
those O
who O
want O
to O
pop O
a O
few O
corks O
in O
a O
row... O

Acceptable O
quality O
/ O
price O
ratio. O

Dishes B-TARGET
with O
an O
infamous O
taste O
reheated O
in O
the O
microwave! O

A O
cold O
welcome! B-TARGET

And O
to O
top O
it O
all O
off, O
cockroaches O
invited O
themselves O
to O
our O
table! O

We O
were O
sick! O

This O
establishment B-TARGET
should O
be O
closed! O

Noisy O
canteen O
with O
no O
other O
charm O
than O
the O
one, O
a O
bit O
old O
fashioned, O
of O
the O
faded O
photos O
of O
the O
"people" O
who O
once O
frequented O
the O
place. O

And O
finally, O
what O
is O
this O
story O
about O
not O
presenting O
a O
menu O
to O
customers O
in O
2013? O

Overrated O
reputation O
for O
an O
address B-TARGET
that O
surfs O
on O
the O
fashion O
that O
carries O
the O
district. O

When O
Marseilles' O
institutions O
fall O
asleep O
on O
their O
reputation, O
they O
are O
only O
frequented O
by O
tourists. O

The O
Marseillais, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
fall O
back O
on O
the O
new O
addresses O
opened O
by O
the O
newcomers O
to O
the O
city... O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
exceptional, O
that O
alone O
is O
worth O
it. O

On O
the O
boullabaisse B-TARGET
side, O
we O
present O
you O
with O
a O
huge O
platter B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
before O
cooking. O

But O
they O
had O
to O
shrink O
with O
cooking, O
2 O
pieces O
full O
of O
bones, O
enormous O
onions, O
a O
little O
juice... O

One O
remains O
on O
its O
hunger, O
one O
asks O
for O
some O
more, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
rab. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
bottles B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
do O
not O
wait O
to O
be O
replaced, O
and O
there, O
the O
bill O
is O
more O
than O
salty. O

Beware, O
the O
tourists O
are O
well O
lightened O
the O
wallet. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
if O
you O
like O
dim O
light, O
are O
students O
or O
bobo/hipster. O

Arrive O
early O
because O
it O
fills O
up O
quickly. O

Affordable O
tapas, B-TARGET
except O
for O
the O
manchego B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
(five O
thin O
slices O
for O
5€) O
and O
the O
serrano B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
(6 O
slices O
for O
10€). O

The O
matron B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
it O
adds O
conviviality O
to O
the O
whole. O

Not O
the O
best O
food B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
eaten, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
you O
can't O
complain. O

The O
dishes O
arrive O
quickly. O

Avoid B-TARGET
going I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
large I-TARGET
groups, I-TARGET
six O
people O
is O
already O
a O
lot. O

PIZZA B-TARGET
so O
thin O
that O
it O
is O
inedible O
: O
you O
have O
to O
break O
it. O

Goat B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
not O
very O
fresh, O
gourmet B-TARGET
coffees I-TARGET
at O
9 O
€, O
dusty O
setting, B-TARGET
unprofessional O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
quickly O
the O
bill O
reaches O
40 O
€ O
for O
bad B-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

In O
short, O
the O
environment O
of O
the O
site B-TARGET
does O
not O
absolutely O
justify O
the O
displacement O
to O
this O
"restaurant" B-TARGET
of O
which O
one O
wonders O
if O
the O
owners O
learned O
to O
cook O
and O
know O
what O
is O
a O
trade. O

Small O
restaurant B-TARGET
of O
nice O
market, O
the O
aperitif B-TARGET
board I-TARGET
is O
good. O

The O
beef B-TARGET
is O
of O
a O
fantastic O
quality, O
the O
numerous O
wines B-TARGET
are O
available O
by O
the O
glass, O
the O
tartar B-TARGET
is O
not O
great O
because O
of O
too O
much O
mustard O
in O
the O
mix... O
besides O
mustard O
in O
tartar... O
strange. O

Otherwise O
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
deix O
not O
of O
the O
part B-TARGET
god. I-TARGET

Good O
but O
there O
is O
better. O

That O
the O
chef O
tries O
to O
reinvent O
the O
classics B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Lyon, I-TARGET
why O
not O
if O
he O
did O
it O
with O
talent. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
said O
menu, B-TARGET
with O
its O
typically O
Lyonnais O
accents, O
is O
not O
only O
bad O
but O
bordering O
on O
the O
grotesque. O

Beyond O
that, O
(1), O
the O
room B-TARGET
needs O
a O
refreshment, O
(2), O
the O
owner B-TARGET
should O
learn O
to O
smile O
and O
(3), O
the O
prices O
are O
crazy O
considering O
the O
poor O
cuisine B-TARGET
we O
were O
served. O

At O
the O
most, O
we O
should O
have O
paid O
25 O
euros O
/ O
head O
for O
such O
a O
mediocre O
meal, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
at O
prices O
of O
this O
order O
there O
are O
much O
better O
in O
Lyon O
and O
that O
at O
the O
prohibitive O
prices O
that O
it O
practices, O
there O
are O
also O
much O
better O
in O
Lyon O
and O
especially O
in O
the O
surroundings, O
including O
starred O
restaurants O
worthy O
of O
the O
name! O

Second O
visit O
to O
this O
small O
restaurant O
in O
Lyon. O

A O
real O
disappointment! O

Mediocre O
dishes, B-TARGET
without O
flavor O
and O
especially O
we O
left O
hungry! O

Too O
bad! O

290€ O
for O
4 O
persons, O
with O
a O
home O
made O
aperitif, O
a O
coke, O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine... O

The O
note O
is O
salty O
and O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
what O
happens O
in O
the O
plate! B-TARGET

Well O
average, O
for O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
which O
thrones O
on O
the O
place O
since O
a O
long O
time O
in O
Saint O
Etienne. O

We O
wanted O
to O
do O
it O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
we O
will O
not O
return O
and O
we O
do O
not O
recommend O
it. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
despite O
everything. O

Appetizing O
dishes B-TARGET
but O
we O
expected O
a O
better O
taste. O

Acceptable O
quality O
/ O
price O
ratio. O

Nice O
welcome B-TARGET
but O
service B-TARGET
a O
bit O
fast. O

Whether O
at O
the O
counter O
or O
at O
the O
drive-through, O
the O
wait B-TARGET
is O
long. O

The O
hot O
products B-TARGET
are O
supplied O
cold O
(fries, O
...) O
and O
there O
are O
always O
elements O
missing O
from O
the O
order O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
recurrent O
forgetfulness O
of O
sauces, O
straws O
and O
napkins. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired O
for O
this O
large O
chain. O

Great O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
very O
well O
informed O
about O
the O
South O
American O
specialties O
!!!!! O

Nice O
cocktail, B-TARGET
very O
good O
food, O
should O
be O
repeated O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
!!!!! O

I O
have O
known O
this O
restaurant O
for O
many O
years, O
having O
brought O
clients O
there. O

For O
nearly O
ten O
years O
I O
had O
not O
returned O
and O
here O
is O
back O
this O
year O
and O
not O
too O
disappointed O
although O
... O
as O
I O
expected O
to O
find O
a O
temple O
of O
gastronomy, O
the O
bar O
was O
a O
little O
high. O

That O
said, O
the O
quality O
is O
always O
there, O
the O
prices O
too... O
but O
quality O
has O
a O
price O
and O
when O
it O
is O
very O
good O
and O
tasty O
it O
is O
never O
too O
expensive. O

A O
little O
isolated O
on O
this O
boulevard O
J O
Janin O
but O
the O
parking O
is O
possible O
without O
going O
too O
far. O

To O
be O
recommended O

I've O
been O
going O
to O
eat O
there O
for O
years O
and O
I've O
brought O
back O
a O
lot O
of O
customers... O

I O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
which O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
kebab O
in O
Mulhouse. O

Delicious O
white B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET

As O
for O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
they O
are O
very O
smiling O
and O
pleasant. O

We O
had O

a O
very O

a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
really O
worth O
its O
price! O

I O
would O
not O
go O
back O
there O
anymore O

Disastrous O
reception, B-TARGET
out O
of O
3 O
waiters, B-TARGET
only O
1 O
of O
them O
said O
hello O
to O
us, O
the O
waiters O
are O
on O
their O
phone O
behind O
the O
bar, O
laughing O
between O
them, O
being O
obviously O
noisy. O

The O
worst O
are O
the O
toilets. O

A O
catastrophe, O
all O
the O
toilets O
are O
full O
of O
excrements, O
no O

To O
avoid O
absolutely, O
take O
your O
legs O
to O
your O
neck. O

Nice O

All O

Some O

A O
chain B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
we O
pushed O
the O
door O
because O
in O
general, O
without O
being O
extraordinary O
it O
is O
a O
value O
on, O
not O
too O
expensive O
and O
fast. O

Not O
here, O
approximate O
cleanliness, O
complicated O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
when O
with O
the O

null. O

Bad O
luck O
that O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back... O

Superb O
reception. B-TARGET

The O
seats O
are O
very O

A O

allows O
you O
to O
eat O
well O
without O
breaking O
the O

and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
on O

are O
also O
very O

Try O
the O

a O

To O
recommend O
with O
closed O
eyes! O

I O
ate O
in O
this O
restaurant O
for O
the O
2nd O
time O
today. O

Friday, O
a O
burger. O

It's O
simply O
the O
best O
I've O
ever O
eaten! O

Good, O
organic, O
perfectly O
cooked, O
hot, O
fragrant O
and O
slightly O
spicy! O

Today, O
a O
slow O
cooked O
beef O
with O
vegetables. O

Everything O
corresponds O
100% O
to O
my O
tastes O
and O
expectations. O

Freshness, O
taste, O
balance, O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

In O
addition, O
all O
served O
by O
a O
very O
nice O
waitress! B-TARGET

What O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for! O

Located O
in O
a O
small O
street O
of O
the O
old O
center O
of O
Gap, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
well O
decorated. O

One O
could O
almost O
believe O
to O
be O
in O
Brittany. O

The O
small O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
appetizing... O
alas O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
by O
the O
Galettes, B-TARGET
not O
very O
big, O
not O
very O
tasty, O
not O
very O
loaded... O

I O
am O
a O
gourmet. O

The O
cider B-TARGET
is O
good... O

AND O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
are O
EXCELLENT O
(the O
paste B-TARGET
and O
the O
accompaniments). B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
professional. O

There O
is O
not O
much O
missing O
from O
this O
address B-TARGET
that O
I O
would O
gladly O
return. O

It's O
the O
best O
pizza O
in O
Gap O
and O
even O
in O
France O
.... O
Ask O
for O
the O
"like O
DAB" O
of O
Chris... O

A O
mixture O
of O
everything O
with O
fresh O
cream O
on O
top, O
all O
on O
a O
delicious O
and O
perfectly O
cooked O
dough... B-TARGET

It's O
really O
worth O
the O
detour.... O

If O
you O
don't O
have O
time, O
ask O
for O
take-out..... O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
one O
Friday O
evening O
with O
friends. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
correct O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
nice. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
impossible O
to O
speak O
without O
shouting O
because O
of O
the O
noise. O

The O
music B-TARGET
was O
really O
loud. O

Very O
negative O
point: O
at O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
gave O
us O
the O
bill O
without O
us O
having O
asked O
for O
it. O

And O
said O
text O
message O
: O
if O
you O
want O
coffee O
or O
digestif O
it's O
in O
5 O
min O
Max O
at O
the O
bar O
!!!!!!!! O

I O
booked O
a O
table O
at O
9pm O
not O
from O
9pm O
to O
10pm! O
I O
find O
that O
very O
average. O

I O
would O
not O
go O
back O
there. O

Completely O
respects O
its O
name O
of O
mountain O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Very O
copious O
dishes, B-TARGET
local O
products B-TARGET
and O
impeccable O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
very O
good O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Another O
positive O
point, O
a O
very O
reasonable O
cost. O

Go O
there O
with O
confidence O
if O
you O
want O
a O
simple, O
honest O
and O
generous O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Pleasant O
setting B-TARGET
and O
formula B-TARGET
for O
two O
well O
served O
with O
good O
products! B-TARGET

A O
nice O
mountain O
menu B-TARGET
too, O
and O
excellent O
ice O
creams B-TARGET
to O
taste O
in O
summer O
in O
the O
small O
garden B-TARGET
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
came O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
had O
excellent O
memories O
of O
it, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
return. O

Arrived O
at O
8 O
there O
was O
only O
a O
table O
of O
2 O
occupied O
to O
believe O
that O
people O
had O
better O
inform O
themselves. O

We O
all O
took O
the O
menu O
at O
29, O
being O
good O
eaters O
it O
looked O
very O
attractive. O

Result O
of O
the O
salad B-TARGET
in O
bag O
with O
a O
ridiculous O
cheese B-TARGET
toast I-TARGET
on O
a O
large O
slice O
of O
bread O
and O
catastrophic O
dishes... B-TARGET

No O
side O
dishes O
noted O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
were O
served, O
we O
had O
frozen O
fries B-TARGET
thrown O
on O
our O
meats B-TARGET
to O
camouflage O
the O
misery O
and O
grilled O
beans B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
had O
fish. O

And O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
disaster O
continued. O

In O
short O
we O
pointed O
it O
out O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
said O
she O
agreed O
with O
us O
that O
the O
menu O
would O
have O
been O
changed O
in O
the O
morning O
in O
the O
kitchen O
but O
not O
on O
paper. O

29euros O
it O
is O
expensive O
for O
frozen O
and O
bag. B-TARGET

We O
went O
there O
twice O
in O
two O
weeks O
and O
before O
varied O
the O
chosen O
dishes. O

Result, O
everything O
is O
very O
good, O
with O
a O
special O
mention O
to O
the O
ravioles B-TARGET
as O
starter O
and O
to O
the O
guinea B-TARGET
fowl I-TARGET
as O
main O
course. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
a O
little O
below. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
are O
warm. O

We O
will O
return O
there! O

To O
be O
avoided O
... O

Salad B-TARGET
as O
starter O
correct O
then O
what O
a O
disappointment O
for O
the O
tartar! B-TARGET

This O
one O
was O
for O
me O
raw O
meat O
covered O
with O
ketchup. O

I O
do O
not O
speak O
about O
the O
accompaniments! B-TARGET

Too O
bad O
my O
opinion O
was O
not O
heard O
during O
the O
meal. O

No O
proposal O
for O
change O
or O
commercial O
gesture. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
are O
big O
fans O
of O
Asian O
restaurants O
and O
we O
were O
very O
disappointed. O

The O
egg O
rolls B-TARGET
are O
ok, O
the O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
small O
(we O
left O
having O
barely O
eaten O
enough), O
the O
crispy B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
is O
not O
crispy O
and O
is O
soaked O
in O
fat. O

The O
prices O
are O
quite O
high O
for O
what O
we O
ate. O

Let's O
not O
talk O
about O
the O
forced O
smile O
of O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
but O
we O
were O
warned O
about O
that. O

We O
will O
not O
go O
back O
there! O

Nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
good O
pizzas B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
salads, B-TARGET
but O
only O
one O
staircase O
to O
climb O
if O
there O
is O
no O
place O
downstairs. O

200m O
from O
my O
house, O
whenever O
I O
want O
a O
pizza O
I O
go O
there. O

The O
smell O
is O
already O
tempting O
when O
we O
pass O
in O
front O
of O
it. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
really O
nice O
and O
I O
even O
got O
a O
free O
pizza O
without O
asking O
anything. O

The O
bressane B-TARGET
is O
my O
favorite. O

The O
dough B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
well O
topped. O

Continue O
like O
that O
it's O
happiness! O

The O
price O
is O
a O
little O
high O
except O
for O
the O
daily B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

Good O
cooking, B-TARGET
a O
little O
downside O
for O
the O
service. B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
you O
have O
the O
embarrassment O
of O
choice O
to O
sit. O

Empty O
permanently, O
to O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
a O
decorative O
window O
of O
the O
street... O

We O
are O
kindly O
welcomed O
by O
the O
owner, B-TARGET
big O
smile. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
cheap O
and O
flashy. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good, O
typical, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
offers O
a O
lot O
of O
choices. O

From O
then O
on, O
one O
wonders O
how O
to O
serve O
fresh O
products O
with O
so O
few O
customers O
and O
such O
a O
menu. O

I O
wonder. O

An O
oasis O
of O
calm, O
where O
you O
have O
to O
whisper O
to O
speak O
because O
it O
resounds: O
everything O
is O
empty! O

The O
prices O
charged O
are O
correct. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
pleasant O
exterior O
and O
a O
good O
location O
that O
made O
us O
want O
to O
have O
lunch O
there. O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
entered O
the O
restaurant, O
the O
waiter's O
welcome B-TARGET
was O
rather O
cold. O

The O
dishes O
arrived, O
for O
my O
part O
a O
Vietnamese B-TARGET
style O
snapper O
fillet O
(just O
covered O
with O
an O
industrial O
hot O
sweet O
Chili O
sauce) B-TARGET
and O
accompanied O
by O
sautéed B-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
(in O
water...) O
which O
moreover O
is O
in O
supplement O
at O
6€. O

Total O
22€ O
for O
the O
fish, B-TARGET
scandalous! O

The O
2 O
other O
guests O
took O
a O
bo B-TARGET
bun I-TARGET
composed O
of O
a O
poor O
nem O
cut O
in O
4, O
salad, O
vermicelli O
and O
beef B-TARGET
that O
I O
will O
not O
even O
give O
to O
my O
dog. O

And O
to O
conclude O
the O
only O
answer O
of O
the O
boss B-TARGET
"maybe O
you O
have O
the O
taste O
of O
someone O
who O
eats O
fast O
food". O

Scandalous O
!!!! O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
city, O
on O
La O
Bourdonnais O
street, O
it's O
not O
easy O
to O
park O
during O
the O
week. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
sober, O
the O
intimate O
decoration B-TARGET
pleases. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
big, O
with O
a O
floor O
and O
a O
steep O
staircase. O

If O
you O
make O
a O
reservation, O
please O
specify O
the O
ground O
or O
first O
floor O
to O
avoid O
surprises. O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
while O
for O
our O
order O
to O
be O
taken. O

At O
lunchtime, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
simple, O
we O
have O
the O
choice O
between O
3 O
starters, O
3 O
main O
courses O
and O
3 O
deserts, O
except O
that O
at O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
more O
the O
choice O
but O
only O
one O
type O
of O
dessert. O

It O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
limited. O

Apparently O
the O
menu O
has O
to O
change O
from O
time O
to O
time. O

I O
chose O
as O
a O
starter O
a O
gratin O
of O
chouchou O
with O
a O
small O
salad B-TARGET
too O
seasoned. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
hard, O
without O
too O
much O
flavor, O
and O
of O
just O
the O
right O
quantity O
with O
a O
good O
presentation. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
fast. O

The O
fruit B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
dessert O
is O
correct. O

So, O
it O
is O
a O
banal O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
does O
not O
leave O
me O
an O
imperishable O
memory. O

Excellent O
pizzas! B-TARGET

Well O
garnished, O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
especially O
they O
are O
not O
disgusting. O

See O
you O
soon O
:) O

At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
aperitif O
it O
is O
a O
sympathetic O
place B-TARGET
well O
located O
in O
the O
square O
cathedral. O

Nice O
decoration, B-TARGET
correct O
service. B-TARGET

Arrived O
the O
hour O
of O
the O
meal O
better O
change O
address. O

Expensive O
menu B-TARGET
for O
the O
quality, O
slow O
service, B-TARGET
lukewarm O
dishes. B-TARGET

A O
pity O
considering O
the O
creative O
ideas. O

The O
flow: O
to O
refuse O
the O
blue O
cards O
one O
weekends O
without O
announcement! O

Scandalous O

Nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
very O
good O
grilled B-TARGET
meat. O

Very O
nice O
and O
helpful O
staff. O

A O
good O
reference O
in O
Kourou. O

Too O
bad O
there O
is O
no O
terrace. O

It O
was O
my O
first O
lunch O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
price O
is O
correct, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
good, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
nice O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
very O
average. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
I O
did O
not O
taste O
the O
pizzas O
;-) O

Mediocre O
food. B-TARGET

High O
price O
for O
the O
service O
and O
especially O
the O
cleanliness O
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired O
in O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
had O
lunch O
surrounded O
by O
flies O
in O
an O
air-conditioned O
room. O

When O
we O
made O
the O
remark O
to O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
as O
a O
response O
we O
were O
entitled O
to O
a O
cynical O
remark. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
must O
quickly O
pull O
itself O
together. O

pleasant O
welcome, B-TARGET
nice O
setting. B-TARGET

We O
regularly O
dine O
there O
as O
a O
group. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
very O
fresh, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
copious, O
the O
accompanying B-TARGET
sauces I-TARGET
and O
vegetables B-TARGET
are O
original O
and O
very O
good. O

A O
very O
good O
address, B-TARGET
in O
the O
genre O

While O
visiting O
the O
Ile O
Royale, O
the O
main O
island O
of O
the O
Salvation O
Islands O
off O
Kourou, O
we O
took O
the O
opportunity O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
only O
restaurant O
on O
site. O

Even O
if O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
courteous, O
the O
services O
suffer O
from O
the O
monopoly. O

Drinks B-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
restricted O
choices, O
we O
move O
to O
find O
a O
waiter, O
we O
wait O
that O
he O
deigns O
to O
take O
care O
of O
you O
... O
ex: O
a O
customer O
went O
to O
ask O
if O
we O
could O
do O
something O
for O
the O
insect O
in O
his O
dish, O
and O
well O
no, O
he O
was O
told, O
it's O
not O
our O
fault, O
we O
can't O
do O
anything O
... O
exceptional O
service, B-TARGET
if O
we O
judge O
by O
this O
fact! O

However, O
it O
would O
take O
very O
little O
to O
make O
this O
place B-TARGET
exceptional O
because O
the O
site B-TARGET
is O
magical O
and O
full O
of O
history. O

We O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
one O
Sunday O
evening. O

We O
took O
the O
menu O
at O
29,90€. O

Starter: O
scallops O
on B-TARGET
skewers I-TARGET
of O
average O
quality. O

We O
don't O
change O
the O
cutlery... O

Main O
course: O
a O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
grilled I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
(not O
very O
tender), O
without O
sauce, O
with O
mashed B-TARGET
carrots I-TARGET
(very O
good), O
broccoli O
and O
uncooked O
potatoes B-TARGET
in O
the O
middle. O

We O
made O
the O
remark O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
passed O
it O
on O
to O
the O
cook. O

We O
heard O
the O
cook O
say O
from O
the O
kitchen O
that O
if O
we O
were O
not O
happy, O
we O
should O
eat O
them O
as O
puree!... O

Dessert: O
2 B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
mousse, I-TARGET
good O
but O
much O
too O
sweet. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
the O
toilets O
are O
not O
up O
to O
scratch. O

The O
establishment O
also O
has O
a O
nice O
terrace. B-TARGET

In O
short, O
a O
cook B-TARGET
who O
is O
not O
very O
well O
trained, O
a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
may O
be O
organic O
but O
not O
gastronomic O
(one O
can O
eat O
organic O
without O
necessarily O
being O
on O
a O
diet...), O
all O
for O
a O
price O
that O
is O
too O
high. O

Good O
setting B-TARGET
but O
apart O
from O
that O
??? O

a O
card B-TARGET
which O
starts O
has O
12e O
without O
salad, O
a O
false B-TARGET
net I-TARGET
has O
25eu O
served O
that O
with O
French O
fries, O
and O
not O
a O
meat O
limousine! O

Good O
surprise, O
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
kindness O
and O
smile. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
and O
well O
heated. O

The O

The O

We O
come O
quite O
regularly O
to O
this O
restaurant, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
original O
and O
well O
presented O
but O
the O
owner O
is O
the O
only O
one O
to O
serve O
it O
often O
happens O
that O
the O
dishes O
are O
lukewarm O
which O
is O
a O
shame. O

A O

A O
small O

Already O
visited O
a O

but O
a O
very O
good O
memory O
that O
was O
confirmed O
once O
again! O

Pleasant O
room. B-TARGET

Fast O
and O
courteous O
service. B-TARGET

The O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
was O
very O
tempting, O
so O
I O
chose O
to O
go O
in. O

I O
take O
the O
formula O
"starter O
- O
dish O
of O
the O
day O
for O
12€50. O

The O
starter B-TARGET
is O
not O
good, O
no O
more O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day. O

It O
is O
replaced O
by O
another O
with O
my O
agreement. O

The O
sauce O
invaded O
the O
fish. B-TARGET

No O
taste. O

The O
bill O
was O
not O
the O
same. O

I O
did O
not O
say O
anything. O

Anyway, O
I O
won't O
go O
back O
there O
because O
not O
good..... O

8€50 O
for O
a O
greek B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
without O
taste: O
2 O
olives, O
a O
piece O
of O
tomato O
drowned O
in O
a O
salad O
that O
is O
bathed O
in O
oil. O

It's O
daring. O

I O
strongly O
advise O
against O
it. O

digestive O
problems O
after O
the O
meal! B-TARGET

I O
repeated O
the O
experience O
several O
times O
but O
it's O
over O
and O
I O
won't O
go O
anymore O
!!!!!!!! O

So O
if O
you O
want O
a O
classy O
restaurant, O
a O
very O
neat O
and O
refined O
cuisine B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
or O
a O

this O
is O
the O
IDEAL O

Reasonably O

... O
impossible O
to O

all O
the O
more O
delighted O
that O
the O
bill O
is O
small. O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
entered O
the O
establishment, B-TARGET
we O
felt O
a O
stress O
around O
the O
employees... O

At O
the O
same O
time O
not O
surprising: O
the O
boss B-TARGET
is O
as O
friendly O
as O
a O
prison O
door... O

He O
directs O
his O
employees O
with O
the O
snap O
of O
his O
fingers... O

Concerning O
the O
cooking, B-TARGET
it O
was O
good O
but O
without O
more: O
pieces O
of O
fat O
in O
the O
chili, B-TARGET
cooking O
of O
the O
meats B-TARGET
badly O
mastered, O
no O
almonds O
on O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
although O
it O
should O
have O
some... O

The O
menu B-TARGET
however O
is O
well O
furnished O
and O
tempting. O

Oh O
yes! O

I O
forgot O
the O
restaurant O
was O
very O
noisy, O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
hear O
each O
other... O

the O
restaurant O
room B-TARGET
is O
like O
a O
canteen, O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
sad, O
as O
for O
the O
meal O
our O
entrecote B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
tender, O

average O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
I O
will O
avoid O
