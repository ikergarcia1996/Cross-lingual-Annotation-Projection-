After O
the O
mailman's O
palace O
we O
are O
at O
the O
stop O
which O
is O
a O
correct O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
boss B-TARGET
welcomes O
us O
very O
warmly O
and O
it O
is O
his O
wife O
who O
cooks. O

It's O
not O
all O
home-made, O
but O
it's O
okay. O

The O
price O
is O
a O
little O
high O
for O
a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
did O
not O
require O
an O
entire O
involvement O
from O
start O
to O
finish. O

Local O
pizzas B-TARGET
that O
you O
won't O
eat O
elsewhere, O
accommodating O
local O
specialties. O

Even O
the O
restaurant O
owner O
eats O
one O
on O
occasion. O

Very O
good O
reception B-TARGET

The O
setting B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
are O
pleasant. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
waiting B-TARGET
is O
endless O
for O
a O
salad O
whose O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
industrial, O
and O
ravioles B-TARGET
in O
a O
bath O
of O
uncooked O
cream. B-TARGET

Berk. O

In O
the O
centre O
of O
this O
very O
small O
village, O
we O
did O
not O
expect O
to O
eat O
as O
well O
on O
a O
pleasant O
terrace. B-TARGET

Pleasant O
service. B-TARGET

Folded O
salad, B-TARGET
medium O
wine, B-TARGET
gratin B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
eatable O
ravioli. O

Good O
ice B-TARGET
cream. O

Neglected O
terrace. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
shame, O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
ideal O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
nice O
but O
it's O
not O
everything! O

If O
you O
are O
on O
holiday, O
if O
you O
have O
– O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
lose O
while O
watching O
waitresses B-TARGET
and O
waiters B-TARGET
(albeit O
charming) O
roar O
like O
flies O
not O
knowing O
what O
to O
do O
or O
for O
whom O
to O
do O
(1 O
hour O
for O
3 O
cold O
chops, B-TARGET
and, O
the O
next O
day, O
3⁄4 O
hours O
for O
3 O
ice O
creams O
never O
arrived...!), O
long O
wait B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
horripilant O
music B-TARGET
(boum O
tchic, O
boom O
tchic, O
constantly). O

We O
are O
reassured O
"the O
boss, B-TARGET
arrested, O
will O
make O
investigations" O
(sic), O
in O
short O
it O
is O
PARFAIT. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
if O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
in O
reasonable O
times O
even O
with O
a O
choice O
of O
dishes, O
then O
FUIR. O

I O
quickly O
advise O
them O
to O
conduct O
an O
organizational O
audit. O

Too O
bad O
the O
frame B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

An O
early O
evening O
that O
starts O
in O
a O
good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
like O
the O
first O
times O
a O
Virgin O
Colada O
at O
6.50th O
to O
get O
into O
appetite O
and O
always O
a O
very O
warm O
welcome B-TARGET
of O
the O
boss B-TARGET
and O
his O
wife. B-TARGET

The O
paving B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Saumon I-TARGET
is O
extra O
but O
to O
change O
I O
test O
the O
squid B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
St I-TARGET
Jacques I-TARGET
nuts I-TARGET
at O
22euros O
with O
in O
gratin B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
(apple O
of O
earth O
and O
sweet O
potato) O
the O
nice O
wedding O
and O
fries. O

That O
happiness O
in O
the O
plate, B-TARGET
the O
cooking O
of O
my O
nuts B-TARGET
are O
perfect, O
slightly O
pearly O
inside, O
mellow O
to O
wish... O
la, O
light B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

I'm O
leaving O
very O
satisfied O
with O
my O
very O
good O
dish. B-TARGET

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
put O
in O
my O
top O
five. O

Final O
note O
of O
31st O
for O
a O
cocktail, O
a O
dish O
and O
a O
coffee. O

A O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

Good O
Creole B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

We O
ate O
with O
our O
children O
who O
also O
enjoyed O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
quite O
cold, O
but O
the O
plates B-TARGET
are O
well O
stocked. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
above O
the O
market, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
guaranteed. O

The O
aperitif B-TARGET
is O
amazing: O
you O
will O
be O
served O
a O
1 O
litre O
bottle O
of O
rum O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
liquid O
cane O
sugar. O

I'm O
sure O
it'll O
brighten O
up O
the O
day. O

Having O
come O
without O
conviction, O
we O
chose O
to O
test O
the O
new O
kitchen O
of O
the O
bar'oc. O

We O
have O
had O
an O
extraordinary O
culinary O
experience. O

Impeccable O
service B-TARGET
and O
stunning O
cocktails. B-TARGET

But O
the O
top O
was O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
entrances. B-TARGET

Fatty B-TARGET
faith I-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
on O
the O
island. O

The O
carpaccio B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wild I-TARGET
jacques I-TARGET
is O
divine. O

Then O
came O
the O
pluma O
of O
pata O
negra O
with O
its O
incredible O
purée B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
oil. I-TARGET

Thank O
you O
rodolphe O
for O
this O
amazing O
meal. B-TARGET

To O
live O
absolutely. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
-at O
first O
glance O
- O
rather O
attractive, O
but O
it O
is O
without O
counting O
on O
the O
unavailability O
of O
many O
foods B-TARGET
(lambi, O
marlin O
and O
tuna O
that O
evening), O
and O
the O
amazing O
prices O
of O
others O
(notably O
the O
"plateaux" B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
seafood, I-TARGET
which O
are O
in O
fact O
only O
small O
plates). O

My O
choice O
was O
therefore O
about O
seafood B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
(2 O
overcooked O
mussels, B-TARGET
3 O
thawed O
holy B-TARGET
jacques, I-TARGET
and O
much O
too O
much O
garlic). O

Very O
noisy O
room B-TARGET
(we O
couldn't O
get O
along O
anymore), O
but O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

The O
frame B-TARGET
is O
sumptuous, O
the O
meal B-TARGET
is O
very O
correct.. O

Good O
lasagna B-TARGET
and O
a O
pleasant O
gourmet B-TARGET
coffee.. I-TARGET

But O
if O
the O
very O
casual O
service B-TARGET
is O
friendly.. O

He O
lacks O
professionalism.. O

Result O
of O
cocktails O
taken O
for O
the O
aperitif O
served O
with O
dishes.. O

I O
took O
no O
pleasure O
in O
taking O
my O
mojito O
with O
my O
lasagna... O
which O
I O
waited O
for O
almost O
30 O
minutes.. O

That's O
a O
shame. O

We O
didn't O
eat, O
we O
drank O
water O
and O
oil. O

Milanese B-TARGET
escalope I-TARGET
breaded O
on O
one O
side O
only O
and O
full O
of O
oil. O

Coast B-TARGET
with O
more O
nerves O
than O
meat O
and O
I O
pass O
it. O

a O
restaurant O
that O
will O
delight O
the O
taste O
buds O
with O
very O
well O
cooked O
products. B-TARGET

But O
a O
catastrophe O
on O
the O
service B-TARGET
side: O
one O
was O
forgotten O
in O
a O
corner, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
tables O
on O
the O
right O
and O
on O
the O
left O
were O
right O
in O
all O
respects O
(you O
should O
be O
American O
or O
large O
family O
to O
be O
interesting O
to O
believe!) O

We O
didn't O
have O
an O
ice O
bucket O
for O
the O
white O
wine, O
no O
bread O
during O
the O
meal, O
we O
had O
to O
stand O
up O
to O
call O
on O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
who O
didn't O
even O
look O
at O
us, O
we O
waited O
a O
lot O
between O
the O
dishes O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
defray O
the O
empty O
plates... O
anyway! O

a O
tasteful O
evening O
spoiled O
by O
these O
very O
unpleasant O
side O

Just O
a O
call O
to O
book O
and O
find O
out O
if O
they're O
open O
in O
relation O
to O
tripadvisor's O
review. O

The O
person O
on O
the O
phone O
is O
cold O
and O
we O
feel O
disturbed O
and O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
closes O
around O
2am, O
we O
are O
informed O
that O
there O
is O
only O
one O
entrecôte O
left O
(I O
put O
it O
aside O
if O
you O
come) O
and O
then O
I O
only O
have O
omelets, O
cheese, O
ham O
left. O

Personally O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
to O
eat O
an O
omelet O
so O
much O
at O
home. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful, O
the O
plate B-TARGET
is O
divine, O
the O
wines B-TARGET
upsetting, O
add O
to O
this O
the O
contagious O
enthusiasm O
of O
the O
boss: O
what O
more O
to O
ask O
for? O

We O
are O
so O
good O
at O
Art B-TARGET
says I-TARGET
Wine, I-TARGET
we O
spend O
good O
moments O
:) O

nice O
welcome B-TARGET
by O
2 O
senior O
"es" O
who O
make O
it O
comfortable O

The O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
at O
the O
top O
with O
local O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
manual O
air O
conditioning O
that O
requires O
an O
explanation O

These O
are O
2*2 O
panels O
of O
wood O
fixed O
on O
the O
ceiling O
with O
at O
their O
base O
a O
band O
of O
floating O
fabric O
manipulated O
by O
a O
cache O
slave O
and O
which O
provides O
a O
real O
flow O
of O
fresh O
air O

To O
avoid O
too O
large O
a O
demand O
incompatible O
with O
their O
oven O
size, O
the O
breath O
to O
the O
big O
margnier O
does O
not O
appear O
on O
the O
map B-TARGET
also O
plan O
to O
order O
it O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
meals O

An O
originality: O
vegetables B-TARGET
are O
counted O
apart, O
no O
doubt O
not O
to O
increase O
the O
price O
of O
dishes B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
the O
old O
one O
that O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
charm O

I O
usually O
only O
give O
advice O
when O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied. O

If O
so, O
I O
think O
I O
fell O
on O
the O
wrong O
day O
or O
on O
the O
wrong O
dish, O
but O
now O
I O
can't O
hold O
back! O

We O
were O
attracted O
to O
the O
rather O
correct O
prices. O

But O
what O
a O
mistake! O

We O
each O
took O
a O
menu O
at O
25euros. O

The O
seafood B-TARGET
in O
the O
entrance O
was O
disgusting O
(are O
they O
fresh?). O

The O
chipirons B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
ink I-TARGET
were O
sweet O
and O
insipid O
(surely O
frozen), O
the O
fisherman's B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
a O
little O
better, O
but O
it O
feels O
that O
nothing O
is O
fresh, O
nor O
prepared O
on O
the O
spot O
and O
they O
use O
poor O
quality O
products. B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
eatable. O

The O
service B-TARGET
didn't O
really O
raise O
the O
level. O

I O
had O
only O
one O
hurry: O
leave! O

Little O
touch O
of O
humor: O
on O
the O
facade O
it O
is O
written O
that O
the O
products O
are O
prepared O
according O
to O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
chef. O

He O
doesn't O
have O
to O
be O
all O
right! O

It O
is O
also O
written: O
"our O
priority: O
to O
satisfy O
you". O

What O
a O
joke! O

They O
are O
not O
ashamed!!! O

We O
took O
the O
plate B-TARGET
discovered I-TARGET
at O
20 O
euros O
and O
we O
were O
not O
received O
Anchois, O
axoa, O
potatoes O
salad O
cheese O
ect.. O
copious O
and O
especially O
good O
Fresh B-TARGET
products, I-TARGET
well O
cooked O
The O
sangria B-TARGET
was O
perfect.. O

restaurant O
in O
a O
charming O
pedestrian B-TARGET
street I-TARGET
of O
Saint O
Jean O
de O
Luz. O

surprise O
before O
even O
placing O
the O
order: O
a O
spider O
was O
housed O
in O
the O
menu!!! O
Immediately O
the O
aperitif O
served, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
brought O
us O
the O
fish O
soups! O

error O
quickly O
corrected O
by O
the O
boss. B-TARGET

I O
ordered O
a O
blue O
magret B-TARGET
with O
fries, O
this O
one O
arrived O
served O
with O
potato O
gratin. O

He O
went O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
to O
be O
served O
with O
fries O
and O
when O
he O
came O
back O
in O
front O
of O
me, O
he O
was O
cold!!! O
Frankly O
not O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
I O
would O
return! O

Besides, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
isn't O
even O
nice O
and O
smiling. O

We O
loved O
everything. O

The O
setting, B-TARGET
dinner O
by O
the O
pool. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
that O
would O
greatly O
deserve O
a O
Michelin O
star. O

Flavour O
associations O
and O
impeccable O
cooking. O

This O
restaurant O
on O
the O
port O
to O
draw O
our O
attention O
by O
the O
sobriety O
of O
its O
map. B-TARGET

Our O
choice O
stopped O
on O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day O
at O
17,50 O
€ O
(entry O
+ O
plate) O

Because O
of O
the O
heat O
we O
were O
kindly O
advised O
a O
table O
in O
the O
air-conditioned O
room. O

The O
aperitif O
was O
a O
little O
accelerated O
by O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
visibly O
rushed O
to O
finish O
his O
service O
and O
who O
came O
to O
propose O
us O
to O
taste O
the O
wine O
while O
we O
were O
only O
commenting O
on O
tasting O
the O
tapenade O
toast. O

( O
quickly O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
head B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
meeting O
room O
) O

The O
suite O
is O
happier O
with O

At O
the O
entrance O
an O
assortment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Corsican I-TARGET
charcuterie I-TARGET
and O
excellent O
cheese B-TARGET
donuts. I-TARGET

Then O
a O
dorad B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
with O
small O
vegetables: O
nicely O
presented O
and O
very O
tasty. O

In O
the O
end O
a O
good O
table B-TARGET
to O
discover! O

The O
title O
summarizes O
everything O

bad O
service B-TARGET

abusive O
price O
for O
the O
service O

Old O
sheep O
as O
lamb B-TARGET

Corsican B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
worse O
than O
SNCF O
sandwich O

cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
in O
singular..... O

I've O
been O
there O
several O
times O
last O
year, O
it O
was O
very O
correct, O
but O
a O
priori O
something O
has O
changed O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
compared O
to O
last O
year O
because O
it O
has O
become O
a O
real O
nightmare. O

Pizza B-TARGET
with O
rubber O
pate B-TARGET
and O
not O
cooked, O
high O
fat O
rib B-TARGET
I O
had O
to O
eat O
1/4 O
of O
it. O

Go O
your O
way! O

I O
don't O
think O
they'll O
see O
me O
anymore. O

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
lunch O
break, O
sheltered O
from O
the O
sun, O
with O
a O
refreshing O
little O
air O
and O
view B-TARGET
of O
the O
port. O

Simple O
but O
good O
cuisine, B-TARGET
Marco O
welcomes O
you O
very O
well, O
gives O
you O
good O
addresses O
if O
you O
ask. O

It's O
a O
very O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

We O
eat O
there O
at O
night, O
his O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
on O
a O
very O
pretty O
square B-TARGET
with O
his O
churches. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
the O
entrance, O
the O
dish O
and O
the O
dessert. O

Just O
a O
fool O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
or O
the O
director B-TARGET
(I O
didn't O
understand) O
with O
his O
cigar O
he O
will O
recognize O
himself O
(if O
not), O
and O
he O
speaks O
too O
much!!!! O

Honestly, O
the O
restaurant O
setting B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
nice. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
reception B-TARGET
is O
"young" O
and O
professional. O

The O
map B-TARGET
offers O
a O
wide O
choice O
of O
brewery O
type. O

But O
big O
disappointment... O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
Burger I-TARGET
is O
well O
presented, O
but O
the O
cheese B-TARGET
slice I-TARGET
is O
equal O
to O
Macdonald... O
No O
flavor O
and O
interest... O

Roquefort B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
too O
creamy, O
no O
taste... O

Chocolate B-TARGET
foam I-TARGET
is O
actually O
a O
ganache O
full O
of O
water... O

That's O
not O
a O
good O
sign... O

Really O
bad O
seen O
the O
neighborhood B-TARGET
and O
the O
frame. B-TARGET

It's O
an O
address O
where O
we O
eat O
regularly. O

Here, O
everything O
is O
pro. O

From O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
to O
the O
plate, B-TARGET
to O
the O
rhythm O
of O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
decor B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
it O
is O
better O
to O
reserve O
a O
table O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
where O
the O
glass B-TARGET
window I-TARGET
is O
located O
open O
in O
summer. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
up O
to O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
entries B-TARGET
are O
7 O
euros O
and O
copious. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good O
but O
don't O
expect O
big O
surprises. O

They O
master O
the O
typical O
bistro O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
meats B-TARGET
are O
excellent O
in O
particular O
the O
shallots B-TARGET
bavette. I-TARGET

Their O
little O
chocolate B-TARGET
pot I-TARGET
in O
dessert O
is O
a O
killing. O

Little O
bluff. O

My O
companion O
is O
vegetarian O
and O
they O
currently O
only O
have O
crustacean O
cream O
gnocchi O
to O
offer O
in O
flat. B-TARGET

It O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
mention O
another O
vegetable O
sauce O
to O
accompany O
them. O

But O
we O
will O
remain O
regular O
customers O
of O
this O
unmissable O
address B-TARGET
of O
lovers O
of O
typical O
Parisian O
breweries. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
well O
decorated. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
have O
no O
taste, O
no O
seasoning O
is O
quite O
rude O
for O
a O
salty O
note. O

To O
know O
Moroccan O
cuisine O
well O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
everything O
of O
a O
tourist O
catch O
that O
shames O
the O
local O
cuisine. B-TARGET

In O
addition O
we O
took O
bottles O
that O
we O
didn't O
finish O
at O
the O
table, O
we O
didn't O
even O
have O
the O
right O
to O
bring O
them O
to O
the O
dining O
room O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
finish O
them. O

This O
dancing B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
nice O
despite O
its O
narrowness O
we O
had O
fun O
but O
there O
were O
few O
people O
so O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
the O
fun O
is O
still O
there O
on O
the O
evenings O
of O
affluence. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
correct O
polite O
but O
without O
training. O

I O
didn't O
eat O
well O
and O
I O
advise O
you O
to O
go O
your O
way. O

What O
a O
disappointment! O

Expectation B-TARGET
out O
of O
measure, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
requested O
is O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
cellar, O
but O
we O
are O
not O
offered O
any O
more! O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
on O
the O
note, O
a O
very O
expensive O
wine O
is O
counted!! O

3 O
dishes O
finally O
arrive, O
then O
a O
desired O
blue O
meat B-TARGET
brought O
well O
cooked. O

Long O
after, O
the O
first O
have O
already O
finished, O
the O
second O
blue, O
cold O
meat. B-TARGET

Unkind O
staff, B-TARGET
little O
available, O
a O
birthday O
meal O
that O
turned O
sour. O

As O
a O
family, O
after O
a O
long O
walk, O
the O
friendly O
weather O
made O
the O
terasse B-TARGET
attract O
us. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
are O
correct. O

We've O
been O
taking O
dishes O
of O
the O
day. O

It O
was O
good, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
exceptional. O

The O
kids O
loved O
home-made O
chocolate B-TARGET
half-baked. I-TARGET

Allow O
a O
waiting O
time O
for O
toilets O
in O
the O
basement O
during O
peak O
hours O
;o) O

If O
you O
go O
there, O
you O
can O
stop O
for O
the O
setting, B-TARGET
the O
surrounding O
birds O
and O
ducks, O
but O
without O
waiting O
for O
something O
exceptional O
from O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

We O
had O
lunch O
there, O
taking O
two O
fomules O
at O
16 O
euros. O

Flat B-TARGET
entrance I-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
in O
the O
middle O
of O
Montmartre B-TARGET
with O
a O
correct O
quality, O
I O
find O
it O
pretty O
good. O

We've O
taken O
a O
carafe, O
so O
I O
can't O
give O
a O
judgment O
on O
the O
drinks. O

Correct O
ravioles B-TARGET
and O
tartiflette, B-TARGET
passable O
suzette B-TARGET
crepe. I-TARGET

Indeed, O
the O
servers B-TARGET
are O
at O
home O
and O
do O
not O
deal O
with O
clients O
when O
they O
talk. O

After O
that O
but O
a O
certain O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
room. O

Ordinary O
meal B-TARGET
but O
which O
allows O
to O
eat O
at O
lower O
cost O
and O
warm. O

Count O
12€ O
the O
adult O
menu O
and O
10€ O
for O
a O
child. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
avoid O
the O
tables O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
catch O
death. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
isn't O
very O
nice. O

We O
are O
a O
little O
narrow O
but O
this O
and O
the O
principle O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
small O
brewery, B-TARGET
decoration B-TARGET
to O
be O
revisited O
because O
aging O
but O
family O
friendly. O

Disappointing O
dinner O
from O
any O
point O
of O
view: O
a O
rather O
sad O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(only O
4 O
tables O
occupied O
on O
Sunday O
evening), O
a O
little O
cold O
service B-TARGET
(only O
one O
person O
in O
the O
room, O
often O
absent, O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
his O
return O
whenever O
we O
wanted O
to O
ask O
for O
something), O
disappointing O
dishes: B-TARGET
the O
arborio B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
truffles I-TARGET
appearing O
in O
the O
menu O
à O
la O
carte O
available O
on O
the O
restaurant's O
website O
had O
become O
a O
simple O
mushrooms O
risotto O
(very O
medium O
anyway), O
for O
the O
same O
price O
(18 O
euros O
in O
the O
entrance), O
and O
the O
veal B-TARGET
ris I-TARGET
was O
too O
cooked, O
dry, O
poorly O
accompanied. O

Disappointing O
glass B-TARGET
wines. I-TARGET

The O
soufflé O
that O
I O
had O
spotted O
on O
the O
map B-TARGET
of O
the O
website O
was O
no O
longer O
proposed. O

Addition: O
160 O
euros O
to O
2 O
with O
2 O
glasses O
each O
and O
sharing O
dessert. O

It's O
not O
worth O
it. O

I O
don't O
recommend O
it. O

An O
address O
to O
advise O
if O
you O
like O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
with O
just O
what O
it O
takes O
to O
taste. O

The O
snails B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
the O
bone B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a O
tasty O
marrow, O
and O
the O
burgundy B-TARGET
of O
our O
neighbors O
was O
embalming... O

Small O
room B-TARGET
but O
much O
less O
noisy O
than O
one O
might O
think, O
old O
stones O
absorb O
the O
noise. O

Service B-TARGET
smiling, O
not O
too O
slow O
or O
too O
fast. O

Early O
evening O
8 O
p.m., O
to O
go O
out O
at O
10:30 O
p.m. O

It's O
a O
really O
good O
night. O

Well, O
a O
little O
expensive, O
but O
it's O
not O
a O
daily O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Required O

Poor O
aperitifs. B-TARGET

Ridiculous O

Coldly O

Sweet O

Apple O
pie B-TARGET
with I-TARGET

without O

worthy O
of O
a O
school O

A O
century O
old, O
plates B-TARGET
are O
scarcely O
supplied, O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
poor O
and O
the O
price/quality O
ratio O
is O
totally O
amazing. O

Frozen O

out O

but O
it's O
the O

over O
the O

Go O
with O
friends O
or O
family... O

You O
won't O
regret O
the O
check! O

This O
discreet O
little O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
worth O
a O
visit, O
first O
of O
all O
- O
and O
it O
must O
be O
emphasized O
- O
for O
the O
warm O
welcome B-TARGET
that O
the O
owner O
reserves O
to O
his O
guests O
(thanks O
for O
the O
kir O
;), O
but O
also O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
served. O

The O
entries B-TARGET
are O
simple O
but O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
offers O
two O
sets O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
allow O
you O
to O
adapt O
to O
all O
budgets. O

For O
our O
part, O
we O
chose O
beef O
tartare. O

Seasoning B-TARGET
was O
done O
directly O
in O
the O
kitchen O
and O
particularly O
delicious. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
range O
is O
humble, O
but O
each O
of O
them O
is O
raised O
by O
a O
small O
creative O
touch O
of O
the O
boss, O
who O
raises O
its O
flavor. O

Without O
hesitating O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
it O
is O
good O
to O
eat O
with O
a O
friend O
or O
family O
member, O
and O
which O
contrasts O
strongly O
with O
the O
"industrial" O
breweries O
sometimes O
found O
in O
Paris. O

Don't O
hesitate! O

A O
wonder! O

A O
fine, O
creative O
and O
absolutely O
delicious O
cuisine, B-TARGET
a O
warm O
setting B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
pleasant O
service. B-TARGET

At O
the O
entrance, O
we O
took O
the O
haddock B-TARGET
like I-TARGET
flamekueche I-TARGET
(delicious) O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
frozen B-TARGET
duck I-TARGET
confided I-TARGET
with O
nuts O
and O
pears O
(very O
good). O

In O
flat, O
I O
completely O
cracked O
on O
the O
cod B-TARGET
risotto I-TARGET
chorizo I-TARGET
emulsion I-TARGET
(very O
surprising). O

Finally O
masterpiece: O
vanilla O
milk O
rice O
caramel B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
salted I-TARGET
butter I-TARGET
(divin). O

Citrus B-TARGET
sanded I-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
was O
also O
perfect O
for O
refreshing O
a O
particularly O
hearty O
dinner. B-TARGET

The O
servers B-TARGET
were O
also O
adorable. O

A O
wonderful O
moment, O
we O
will O
go O
back O
there O
for O
sure, O
and O
warmly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

I've O
already O
eaten O
in O
over O
50 O
betting O
breweries O
and O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
feel O
compelled O
to O
leave O
an O
opinion... O

the O
service B-TARGET
was O
close O
to O
the O
absolute O
zero O
and O
the O
server B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
kind O
but... O
if O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
right, O
I O
wouldn't O
have O
come O
here O
to O
write O
a O
review. O

I've O
got O
fried O
with O
fries! O

Oh, O
my O
God, O
fries B-TARGET
not O
well O
cooked, O
cold O
and O
that O
barely O
come O
out O
of O
the O
freezer...the O
bavet B-TARGET
aie O
aie O
aie, O
she O
bathed O
in O
oil O
and O
no O
taste... O

I O
think O
I'm O
catching O
up O
on O
dessert O
with O
chocolate B-TARGET
lol I-TARGET
foam, I-TARGET
and O
I'm O
really O
enjoying O
an O
execrable O
foam! O

No O
taste, O
worse O
than O
metro... O
even O
discount O
chocolate O
foam O
are O
better.... O

I O
really O
wondered O
if O
my O
guys O
were O
aware O
of O
the O
m... O
that O
they O
were O
serving... O

no O
luck, O
tossed O
sick O
after O
noon, O
the O
meal B-TARGET
is O
doubted O
for O
something!! O

to O
escape O
if O
you O
take O
the O
bavette, O
fries O
and O
a O
moss!!! O

I O
won't O
take O
the O
risk O
of O
testing O
the O
other O
dishes... O

The O
best O
street O
setting B-TARGET
with O
its O
authentic O
beams O
and O
frames O
of O
spacious O
price O
tables O
and O
a O
rare O
price-quality O
ratio O
with O
fresh O
and O
homemade O
products. B-TARGET

Different O
formulas B-TARGET
at O
12,5€, O
15,80€ O
and O
18,90€ O
that O
bring O
together O
starter O
+ O
dish O
+ O
dessert!!! O
Suffice O
it O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
very O
rare O
in O
St. O

Germain O
des O
Près. O

The O
servers B-TARGET
are O
very O
smiling O
and O
patient. O

A O
real O
crush. O

I O
went O
several O
times O
during O
my O
Parisian O
getaways, O
dinner O
in O
this O
well-located O
establishment. B-TARGET

The O
reception B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly; O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
dynamic, O
helpful. O

It's O
nice O
to O
feel O
that O
because O
it's O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
rare. O

Eating O
in O
the O
evening O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
a O
pure O
treat. O

The O
content O
of O
the O
plates B-TARGET
is O
equally O
successful: O
copious O
and O
very O
good O
from O
starter O
to O
desserts. O

I O
will O
continue O
to O
spend O
good O
times O
in O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
on O
my O
next O
trips O
in O
a O
charming O
setting B-TARGET

We O
were O
initially O
attracted O
to O
a O
sunny O
terrace, B-TARGET
quiet O
and O
its O
map B-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices. O

Since O
then O
we O
have O
had O
lunch O
and O
dinner O
several O
times. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good O
or O
very O
good, O
extremely O
varied O
with O
a O
daily O
fish O
and O
meat O
menu B-TARGET
(Capuchino B-TARGET
pea I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
not O
to O
be O
missed) O
This O
is O
a O
family O
home-made O
kitchen B-TARGET
most O
of O
the O
time. O

The O
team B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
serviable. O

We're O
served O
without O
waiting O
and O
in O
a O
good O
mood. O

I O
recommend O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
of O
a O
mediocrity O
without O
a O
name! O

We O
waited O
15 O
minutes O
for O
the O
table O
to O
be O
prepared O
and O
40 O
minutes O
after O
ordering O
a O
burgundy B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
whose O
quality O
and O
taste O
leave O
to O
be O
desired! O

Almost O
raw O
potatoes B-TARGET
with O
raw O
carrots B-TARGET
and O
tasteless, O
unseasoned O
sauce! B-TARGET

I O
don't O
think O
we've O
ever O
laughed O
so O
much O
at O
our O
head! O

No O
communication O
from O
the O
staff B-TARGET
who O
served O
other O
customers O
who O
arrived O
after O
before O
us O
(entry O
and O
flat) O
included! O

A O
scandal! O

I O
really O
almost O
left O
after O
a O
40-minute O
wait O
when O
I O
saw O
the O
plate O
coming O
because O
I O
clearly O
found O
the O
behavior O
of O
the O
boss B-TARGET
execrable O
and O
disdainful. O

A O
tip: O
don't O
put O
your O
feet O
on O
it, O
catch O
tourist O
and O
waste O
time O
and O
money! O

The O
view O
from O
the O
outside O
on O
the O
large B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
bottle I-TARGET
shelf I-TARGET
attracted O
us. O

So O
we O
went O
back O
to O
this O
very O
original O
wine O
bar O
restaurant! O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
adorable, O
the O
wine B-TARGET
and O
the O
tips O
for O
choosing O
it O
are O
at O
the O
top! O

Ideal O
for O
spending O
an O
apero O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
ham O
to O
snack O
on. O

We O
were O
less O
seduced O
by O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
we O
found O
a O
little O
expensive O
vs O
the O
quality O
proposed O
although O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
fresh O
and O
that O
is O
important. O

In O
a O
quiet O
street, B-TARGET
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
and O
warm, O
the O
pleasant O
and O
comfortable O
room. B-TARGET

With O
family O
or O
friends, O
the O
tone O
of O
the O
music B-TARGET
at O
a O
suitable O
height, O
allows O
to O
hold O
a O
conversation O
without O
screaming, O
while O
enjoying O
excellent O
dishes, B-TARGET
nicely O
presented O
and O
very O
tasty, O
served O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
accompanied O
by O
very O
good O
wines. B-TARGET

To O
be O
done O
again!! O

I O
am O
well O
aware O
that O
this O
opinion O
will O
not O
change O
anything, O
since O
the O
bar B-TARGET
is O
placed O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
it O
can O
always O
attract O
tourists O
but O
good, O
such O
a O
scandalous O
place B-TARGET
deserves O
to O
be O
denounced. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
we O
inherited O
is O
an O
old O
acariatist O
whose O
rudeness O
reflects O
his O
disgust O
for O
his O
profession O
and O
his O
unlikely O
self-esteem. O

This O
unpleasant O
service B-TARGET
is O
crowned O
with O
an O
incomprehensible O
card, B-TARGET
at O
exhorbitant O
prices. O

We O
contented O
ourselves O
with O
one O
drink O
each, O
which O
were O
not O
even O
clean. O

It's O
a O
scandal. O

Already O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
well O
placed O
I O
find. O

We're O
in, O
and O
there, O
no O
one O
to O
welcome O
us... O

A O
TV O
to O
turn O
on, O
but O
we O
waited O
5 O
minutes O
before O
we O
saw O
someone, O
who O
asked O
us O
to O
come O
to O
the O
restaurant O
next O
door... O

Welcome B-TARGET
not O
too O
bad, O
but O
I O
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
be O
able O
to O
chat O
with O
my O
spouse O
without O
being O
listened O
to O
by O
one O
of O
the O
waitresses.. B-TARGET

At O
the O
meal O
level, O
it O
was O
fast O
enough O
to O
be O
served. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
good, O
but O
it's O
probably O
frozen O
and O
it's O
a O
shame O
I O
got O
my O
dessert O
when O
my O
man O
was O
done! O

We O
discovered O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
Groupon, O
I O
don't O
recommend O
it O
without O
this O
offer. O

Clearly O
this O
is O
our O
canteen O
since O
we O
work O
right O
next O
door. O

the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
large O
and O
largely O
sunny, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
efficient O
and O
fast, O
formula B-TARGET
changing O
every O
day, O
and O
there O
are O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
supplement O
that O
I O
often O
put O
water O
to O
my O
mouth. O

Nice O
to O
have O
a O
drink O
after O
work. O

ah: O
when O
it's O
a O
little O
chilly, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
heated O
and O
they O
put O
plaids O
on O
the O
chairs, O
it O
helps O
:) O

One O
of O
the O
few O
restaurants O
in O
the O
neighborhood. O

Bonded O
with O
employees O
from O
the O
neighbourhood's O
companies. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
correct O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
are O
very O
expensive. O

No O
meat O
on O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

Tiramisu B-TARGET
very O
good O
and O
abundant. O

To O
avoid O
winter O
because O
few O
indoor O

The O
excellent O
reviews O
of O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
have O
been O
confirmed O
at O
the O
table. O

The O
menu-card B-TARGET
offers O
a O
choice O
for O
all O
tastes O
and O
allows O
you O
to O
discover O
well O
presented O
seasonal B-TARGET
dishes. I-TARGET

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
a O
priori O
renewed O
every O
day O
with O
3 O
entries, O
3 O
dishes O
and O
3 O
desserts. O

But O
the O
must O
remain O
obviously O
the O
tartare B-TARGET
dorad, I-TARGET
the O
cajun B-TARGET
shrimps, I-TARGET
the O
gnocchi B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
agria I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
white I-TARGET

the O
back B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cod I-TARGET
with O
plancha O
(perfectly O
cooked O
and O
served O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
salsifis). O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
also O
short O
and O
gives O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
the O
Côtes O
du O
Rhône O
and O
Languedoc O
Roussillon O
by O
highlighting O
affordable O
cuvées, B-TARGET
some O
of O
which O
come O
from O
renowned O
producers. O

Careful O
and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

The O
sommelier B-TARGET
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
change O
a O
bottle O
with O
a O
defect. O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
bistro O
chic. O

A O
little O
noisy O
but O
as O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
seems O
filled O
every O
night... O

Only O
the O
famous O
candy O
box O
was O
missing O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal! O

A O
good O
address B-TARGET
just O
a O
stone's O
throw O
from O
the O
Star. B-TARGET

Another O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
gradually O
loses O
quality. O

The O
deco B-TARGET
is O
great, O
I'm O
rather O
a O
fan, O
even O
if O
the O
preference O
goes O
to O
the O
recup O
or O
industrial O
Deco, O
this O
romantic O
type O
deco O
rather O
likes O
it. O

Inside B-TARGET
we O
are O
quiet O
and O
if O
we O
like O
to O
see O
the O
world O
passing O
we O
get O
on O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
in O
the O
summer O
elsewhere O
or O
I O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
with O
friends O
watching O
people O
pass. O

Again O
the O
problem O
as O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurant O
finally O
the O
problem O
lies O
in O
the O
food B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
at O
the O
level, O
neither O
the O
address, O
nor O
the O
effort O
made O
at O
the O
decoration. B-TARGET

A O
few O
years O
ago, O
the O
heart-shaped O
burger B-TARGET
was O
a O
must O
have, O
it O
has O
now O
become O
common, O
I O
don't O
even O
finish O
it O
anymore. O

I O
loved O
the O
scenery... B-TARGET

I O
enjoyed O
the O
history B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
place. O

Nudes O
had O
oysters, O
pink O
shrimp O
and O
lobster O
in O
the O
entrance, O
the O
products B-TARGET
were O
of O
quality. O

The O
shrimps B-TARGET
were O
firm O
and O
excellent. O

Lobster B-TARGET
a O
little O
small, O
probably O
Canadian. O

Then O
the O
bouillabaisse O
in O
2 O
services... O

The O
soup B-TARGET
first O
of O
all O
very O
good, O
generous O
in O
croutons... O

The O
sequel, O
the O
very O
fine O
fish, B-TARGET
one O
of O
the O
fishes O
was O
filled O
with O
stopping, O
it's O
a O
shame O
but O
good... O

This O
does O
not O
remove O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
bouillabaisse... B-TARGET

As O
a O
dessert, O
a O
pancake O
and O
a O
large O
marnier O
soufflé. O

Beautiful O
success O
on O
the O
blower, B-TARGET
attention O
impressive O
size!! O
Bottom O
well O
in O
the O
mouth, O
not O
heavy O
at O
all! O

It O
was O
a O
very O
good O
lunch. B-TARGET

An O
extremely O
well O
located O
restaurant B-TARGET
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Champs O
Elysée! O

Level O
decoration B-TARGET
it O
remains O
very O
inventive O
and O
changes O
the O
ordinary O
decoration. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
correct O
for O
the O
prices O
charged. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
busy O
with O
the O
different O
tables O
so O
don't O
expect O
any O
special O
attention O
to O
you! O

Restaurant B-TARGET
to O
try O
(at O
least O
once) O
to O
get O
an O
idea O
of O
it. O

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
with O
views B-TARGET
of O
the O
Eiffel O
Tower O
c O
is O
certain O
but O
and O
there O
is O
really O
one O
but O
beyond O
prohibitive O
prices O
for O
a O
very O
average O
dinner B-TARGET
in O
quality O
and O
very O
pretense O
in O
presentation... O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
deplorable, O
you O
have O
to O
beg O
them O
to O
take O
the O
order, O
they O
forget O
to O
bring O
the O
carafe O
of O
water, O
they O
ignore O
our O
raised O
hands O
and O
take O
a O
crazy O
time O
for O
the O
addition O

For O
gogo O
tourists O
and O
again O

It's O
been O
5 O
years O
since O
we O
came O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant O
that O
offers O
a O
superb O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
a O
nice O
area B-TARGET
of O
Paris... O

But O
my O
God, O
what O
a O
disaster O
in O
service B-TARGET
and O
cooking. B-TARGET

When O
we O
arrived, O
three O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
waitresses B-TARGET
passed O
us O
before O
we O
were O
simply O
addressed. O

The O
arrival O
of O
the O
manager B-TARGET
was O
caricatural O
with O
his O
crooked O
table O
plan O
trying O
to O
place O
us O
inside O
despite O
our O
express O
request O
from O
the O
terrace. O

Finally O
we O
won. O

Sitting O
on O
uncomfortable O
garden O
chairs O
we O
wait O
for O
the O
aperitif O
that O
arrives O
very O
quickly O
the O
only O
hit O
c O
is O
the O
difference O
between O
our O
two O
glasses B-TARGET
for O
the O
same O
1/4 O
alcohol O
of O
different O
quantity. O

I'll O
pass O
you O
the O
meal, O
the O
products B-TARGET
of O
which O
are O
of O
any O
kind. O

Even O
Pierre O
herme's O
desserts B-TARGET
that O
I O
would O
invite O
to O
stop O
authorizing O
distribution O
in O
this O
establishment O
were O
served. O

Too O
fresh. O

To O
accompany O
him O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine. O

Not O
having O
arrived O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
addition O
I O
point O
out O
that O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
worth O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
me. O

Well, O
you O
won't O
believe O
that O
I'm O
being O
brought O
with O
the O
addition O
by O
telling O
me O
that O
it O
was O
already O
served. O

What O
he O
had O
forgotten O
to O
say O
was O
that O
he O
was O
also O
already O
counted O
in O
the O
addition. O

In O
short, O
I O
don't O
know O
where O
the O
former O
owners O
have O
gone, O
but O
someone O
has O
to O
take O
over O
the O
property. B-TARGET

Waiting O
for O
a O
word O
of O
order O
not O
to O
go. O

Ah O
yes O
I O
forgot O
not O
to O
look O
at O
the O
map B-TARGET
displayed O
in O
the O
window O
you O
will O
see O
there O
at O
least O
2 O
dead O
flies O
crushed O
I O
dare O
not O
put O
a O
foot O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

For O
flies O
I O
have O
the O
picture. O

But O
I O
don't O
publish O
it O
for O
sensitive O
souls. O

A O
table B-TARGET
that O
holds O
the O
road O
in O
a O
neighborhood O
where O
tables O
change O
very O
quickly? O

Sophisticated O
but O
without O
too O
much, O
but O
not O
noisy O
at O
all, O
at O
the O
table O
or O
at O
the O
counter. O

Very O
nice O
menu B-TARGET
at O
35 O
euros O
at O
noon O
that O
changes O
all O
the O
time. O

A O
la O
carte,more B-TARGET
expensive, O
sole B-TARGET
miller I-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
delight O
(49 O
euros O
anyway) O
and O
everyone O
knows O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
succeed. O

Veal B-TARGET
rib, O
too. O

Wine B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
glass I-TARGET
(happily!). O

Exquisite O
gourmet B-TARGET
coffee. I-TARGET

In O
any O
case O
regular O
in O
a O
beautiful O
setting B-TARGET
close O
to O
the O
Invalides. O

What O
a O
pleasure O
to O
welcome, B-TARGET
this O
big O
smile, O
this O
kiss, O
the O
whole O
very O
natural, O
we O
are O
no O
longer O
accustomed O
to O
this O
friendly O
side, O
especially O
in O
Paris! O

And O
the O
setting!!! B-TARGET
And O
the O
kitchen!!! B-TARGET
We O
also O
come O
and O
especially O
for O
this O
and O
our O
last O
lunch B-TARGET
was, O
as O
always, O
extra: O
Turbot B-TARGET
poached I-TARGET
with O
rhubarb, O
creamy B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
with O
its O
puree O
of O
panais, O
floating B-TARGET
island I-TARGET
and O
pie B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pralines...the I-TARGET
whole O
watered O
with O
an O
excellent O
Beaujolais... B-TARGET
that O
happiness O
and O
that's O
how O
all O
customers O
become O
regulars, O
or O
rather O
friends O

Sun O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
Sundays, O
pretty O
nice O
decor, B-TARGET
it O
was O
pretty O
good.... O

We O
order O
two O
champagne B-TARGET
pools I-TARGET
that O
are O
served O
to O
us O
after O
20 O
minutes... O
and O
without O
ice!!! O

When O
we O
ask O
a O
sour O
waiter B-TARGET
like O
a O
pickle O
macerated O
in O
vinegar O
for O
54 O
years O
if O
our O
order O
has O
been O
taken O
he O
literally O
assaults O
us O
by O
telling O
us O
that O
champagne O
is O
being O
sought O
(visiblely O
directly O
in O
Reims) O

In O
short, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
don't O
even O
bother O
to O
speak O
in O
English O
to O
the O
poor O
tourists O
stranded O
here, O
the O
silky O
boss, B-TARGET
botoxed, O
until O
she O
has O
her O
face O
frozen O
(that O
must O
be O
the O
reason O
for O
her O
cruel O
lack O
of O
smile) O
gets O
on O
the O
terrace O
but O
doesn't O
push O
the O
orders O
faster... O

In O
short, O
run O
away O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
spoil O
your O
day O
surrounded O
by O
arrogant O
people! O

Great O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
welcoming, O
unfortunately O
they O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
describe O
the O
dishes, O
the O
original O
names O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
incomprehensible. O

Once O
served, O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
to O
feel O
bad, O
my O
bagette B-TARGET
was O
drowned O
under O
an O
absurd O
amount O
of O
insipid O
blue B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
as O
for O
my O
friend's O
salad B-TARGET
it O
was O
full O
of O
oil, O
fat O
and O
fat. O

For O
Info O
we O
both O
fell O
ill O
in O
the O
night. O

To O
flee!!! O

It O
is O
a O
very O
beautiful O
address... B-TARGET
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
remarkable O
because O
the O
cooking O
is O
perfect, O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
rather O
seasonal, O
everything O
is O
homemade. O

There's O
a O
card O
and O
slates O
for O
the O
formulas. O

It O
is O
a O
mix O
of O
creative O
proposals O
but O
also O
great O
classics. O

The O
plate B-TARGET
is O
perfect O
from O
the O
entrance O
to O
dessert, O
which O
is O
not O
so O
common. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
focused O
but O
very O
well, O
in O
white O
and O
red. O

We O
are O
well O
in O
a O
logic O
of O
selection O
and O
quality. O

These O
are O
not O
first O
prices O
but O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
the O
value B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
money I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
excellent. I-TARGET

The O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
are O
both O
pros O
but O
relaxed, O
there O
is O
what O
it O
takes O
to O
feel O
good O
but O
also O
to O
be O
very O
well O
received O
and O
come O
back! O

It O
is O
to O
conclude O
a O
very O
beautiful O
address, B-TARGET
a O
rare O
alliance O
of O
tradition O
and O
modernity, O
of O
beautiful O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
that O
remains O
legible, O
pleasant, O
sophisticated O
without O
too O
much. O

No O
wonder O
it's O
often O
advised O
by O
gastronomic O
critics. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
ideally O
placed O
for O
business O
meals. O

However, O
it O
is O
absolutely O
not O
worth O
the O
detour, O
except O
to O
see O
and O
be O
seen. O

A B-TARGET
la I-TARGET
carte I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
out O
of O
price O
(about O
20 O
euros O
for O
4 O
steams... B-TARGET
certainly O
good O
but O
it O
makes O
a O
lot O
for O
a O
steam) O
and O
are O
not O
of O
exceptional O
quality. O

If O
you O
want O
two O
accompaniments, B-TARGET
it O
is O
even O
counted O
as O
an O
extra!! O

As O
for O
the O
service, B-TARGET
it O
is O
really O
to O
be O
seen O
again. O

Ordering O
and O
arrival O
of O
the O
interminable O
entrance... O
and O
then O
the O
dishes O
that O
do O
not O
arrive O
together O
and O
half O
the O
accompaniments O
that O
are O
missing. O

In O
short, O
to O
avoid!!! O

A O
little O
complicated O
menu B-TARGET
between O
Bo O
Boun's, O
salads O
and O
the O
rest. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
have O
a O
good O
appetite O
because O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
copious O
and O
good. O

And O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
pleasant! O

Too O
bad O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
so O
uncomfortable, O
we're O
a O
little O
on O
each O
other O
and O
if O
you're O
corpulent, O
prefer O
the O
terrace. O

Staff B-TARGET
are O
often O
overwhelmed, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
key O
to O
success O
and O
fame. O

Super O
menu, B-TARGET
new O
and O
surprising O
flavor O
combinations, O
very O
pleasant O
setting.... B-TARGET
damages O
that O
the O
general O
impression O
is O
served O
by O
a O
haughty O
and O
unpleasant O
service! B-TARGET

Too O
much O
to O
want O
to O
escape O
the O
codes O
of O
the O
gourmet O
restaurant O
(and O
in O
particular O
the O
excess O
of O
zeal O
that O
can O
sometimes O
characterize O
the O
service), B-TARGET
Chateaubriand O
goes O
in O
my O
opinion O
too O
far! O

Admittedly O
it O
is O
an O
honour O
to O
be O
able O
to O
taste O
the O
inventive O
cuisine B-TARGET
of O
a O
chef O
like O
Inaki O
Aizpitarte... O
but O
whatever O
the O
reputation O
of O
the O
establishment O
and O
its O
success, O
I O
think O
the O
guests O
have O
the O
right O
to O
wait O
to O
be O
served O
by O
people O
at O
least O
kind O
(if O
only O
because O
they O
pay)! O

For O
my O
part, O
I O
was O
sent O
back O
to O
my O
goals O
for O
having O
had O
the O
misfortune O
to O
ask O
for O
details O
about O
the O
composition O
of O
a O
dessert O
that O
was O
not O
presented O
to O
us O
(in O
this O
case O
the O
tocino O
del O
cielo, O
a O
classic O
of O
the O
house... O
we O
should O
have O
known O
that O
maybe O
that's O
why?). O

And O
the O
person O
who O
accompanied O
me, O
auvergnate, O
allowed O
herself O
a O
remark O
with O
a O
big O
smile O
on O
the O
thickness O
of O
the O
slice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
St-Nectaire I-TARGET
that O
had O
been O
served O
to O
him O
(less O
than O
2mm) O
to O
hear O
an O
answer O
"Ah O
good..." O
dry O
and O
cold. O

In O
short, O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
success O
of O
the O
establishment O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
mounted O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
servers B-TARGET
that O
have O
tarnished O
or O
even O
ruined O
what O
could O
have O
been O
a O
very O
good O
time... O

instead O
of O
the O
intended O
topping, O
you O
will O
have O
the O
planned O
topping O
and O
a O
fries B-TARGET
supplement I-TARGET
(frozen) O
at O
5 O
euros. O

In O
short, O
nice O
setting, B-TARGET
pleasant O
staff, B-TARGET
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
but O
dishes B-TARGET
offered O
and O
map B-TARGET
to O
be O
reviewed O
in O
depth. O

At O
around O
12.50 O
p.m. O
in O
a O
crowded O
room, O
we O
are O
offered O
a O
wide O
table O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
room. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
noisy O
but O
rather O
pleasant. O

After O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting, B-TARGET
a O
waiter O
arrives. O

He O
takes O
the O
order O
in O
an O
overtone O
by O
turning O
to O
give O
orders O
to O
the O
other O
servers. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
honest, O
I've O
chosen O
a O
hot O
goat O
spread, O
my O
husband's O
menu O
at O
13 O
euros. O

Honest, O
no O
more. O

In O
short, O
a O
suitable O
address, B-TARGET
if O
we O
agree O
to O
be O
treated O
as O
a O
simple O
addition O
regulator... O

We O
arrive O
in O
a O
quasi-empty O
room B-TARGET
on O
Friday O
night, O
despite O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
friend O
of O
this O
restaurant O
as O
being O
a O
good O
gastro O
address O
at O
nice O
prices... O

First O
table O
where O
we O
are O
installed, O
the O
bulb O
on O
top O
is O
roasted, O
half O
dark O
and O
the O
candles O
on O
the O
side O
seem O
well O
covered O
with O
dust... O

Just O
like O
the O
horrible O
curtains B-TARGET
hanging O
over O
our O
heads. O

We O
look O
at O
the O
turn O
of O
us O
and O
we O
realize O
that O
this O
is O
actually O
a O
background O
prefabricated O
course O
redone O
with O
a O
dubious O
taste, O
like O
the O
photos O
of O
vintage O
prostitutes O
that O
cover O
the O
walls O
in O
truncated O
frameworks. O

That O
was O
for O
the O
frame... O

On O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
side, O
a O
complete O
lack O
of O
surprise, O
discovery O
or O
audacity... O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
ridiculous, O
three O
bites O
of O
veal B-TARGET
tabs I-TARGET
(veals O
of O
25 O
years, O
no O
doubt, O
so O
much O
the O
meat O
is O
red) O
and O
a O
thin O
blade O
of O
dauphinous B-TARGET
gratin, I-TARGET
all O
bathed O
in O
an O
insipid O
sauce B-TARGET
that O
actually O
seemed O
to O
be... O
water. O

Tuna B-TARGET
is O
so O
raw O
that O
you O
have O
to O
go O
to O
Japanese, O
but O
my O
companion O
likes O
it, O
tunas... O

We O
would O
like O
to O
stop O
the O
fresh, O
but O
there O
was O
dessert: O
the O
beautiful O
pear O
Helen O
"revisited", O
where O
how O
an O
ice B-TARGET
cream O
turns O
into O
cream O
in O
a O
blouse O
of O
chocolate O
where O
snuggling O
pieces O
of O
fruit. O

I O
don't O
write O
an O
opinion, O
but O
I'm O
thinking O
tonight O
that O
maybe O
it O
was O
a O
bad O
taste O
on O
my O
part... O

Yes, O
that O
must O
be O
it, O
tonight, O
I O
lost O
the O
taste, O
the O
taste O
of O
slamming O
100€ O
in O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
without O
flavor O
or O
ambiance. B-TARGET

We O
were O
in O
March O
tonight O
with O
friends O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
one O
of O
them's O
birthday. O

We O
arrived O
at O
this O
pub O
restaurant O
for O
dinner. O

But O
given O
that O
we O
were O
too O
many O
(13 O
people), O
we O
were O
installed O
upstairs O
(by O
making O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
ground O
floor O
was O
intended O
for O
regulars O
and O
football O
enthusiasts O
and O
that O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
consume O
it O
had O
to O
go O
down O
to O
order) O
in O
an O
Iounge B-TARGET
space I-TARGET
barely O
lit O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
read O
the O
menu O
(we O
had O
to O
use O
the O
lamps O
of O
our O
smartphone). O

After O
making O
the O
staff B-TARGET
understand O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
align O
one O
table O
next O
to O
another, O
we O
went O
down O
again. O

Start O
the O
dinner O
with O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
dish. O

In O
the O
part O
concerning O
the O
burgers B-TARGET
it O
was O
written O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
order O
the O
burger O
without O
the O
bread O
(interest?). O

By O
asking O
a O
waitress O
if O
taking O
this O
option O
allowed O
a O
discount O
on O
the O
price O
(already O
expensive O
enough O
for O
the O
quality), O
the O
manager B-TARGET
arrived O
by O
saying O
that O
the O
price O
was O
not O
changing O
(after O
that O
comes O
an O
explanation O
of O
the O
margin O
that O
the O
restaurant O
then O
realized), O
and O
later O
replied O
"we O
are O
a O
restaurant O
so O
our O
goal O
is O
to O
make O
margin" O
(an O
expert O
in O
customer O
relationship O
that O
one). O

In O
short O
(because O
it's O
a O
long O
time O
to O
say), O
we O
spent O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
an O
evening O
tarnished O
by O
the O
image O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
(the O
state O
of O
which O
leaves O
something O
to O
be O
desired), O
a O
service B-TARGET
at O
the O
table O
worthy O
of O
an O
adolescent O
canteen, O
and O
no O
small O
words O
of O
apology O
or O
remission O
(when O
you O
have O
to O
make O
margin O
by O
any O
means...) O
to O
go O
back O
with O
the O
smile O
(it O
wasn't O
won). O

For O
having O
been O
tested O
by O
members O
of O
the O
evening O
in O
advance, O
we O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
first O
time O
for O
some O
and O
the O
last O
time O
for O
everyone O
that O
we O
were O
coming O
to O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

I O
can't O
believe O
this O
brewery O
is O
chaining O
up O
tourist O
groups... O

What O
a O
shame O
for O
French O
gastronomy!!! O

That O
day O
I O
wanted O
a O
beef O
tartare. O

I've O
got O
some O
family O
that's O
having O
this O
ensign, O
so O
I'm O
joining O
them. O

So O
on O
the O
menu, O
a O
fried O
beef O
tab, O
a O
fried O
tartare O
steak, O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
sole O
with O
puree. O

We're O
gonna O
make O
it O
simple. O

ALL O
MEAT B-TARGET
ARE I-TARGET
GOUTH O
AND O
DRY!!! O

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
certainly O
home O
but O
DO O
HOURS O
AT O
ADVANCE O
AND O
MOLLASSONS. O

Puree's B-TARGET
worse O
than O
in O
the O
canteen. O

Run! O

You O
don't O
have O
to O
give O
our O
fry O
to O
this O
scam. O

They're O
really O
shutting O
down! O

Menu O
of O
the O
day O

- O
an O
excellent O
smoked B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
entry O
on O
celery O

- O
sautéed B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
veal I-TARGET
with O
a O
very O
good O
tagliatelle O

A O
little O
expensive O
wine B-TARGET

Two O
small O
remarks O

- O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
overheated O
which O
is O
really O
unpleasant O

- O
the O
caraffe B-TARGET
water I-TARGET
is O
not O
fresh O
(to O
be O
connected O
with O
the O
previous O
point???) O

Very O
competitive O
for O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
what O
we O
have O
on O
our O
plate. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
friendly O
but O
very O
expeditious, O
we O
have O
no O
time O
to O
finish O
a O
dish O
that O
we O
are O
asked O
if O
we O
are O
to O
finish. O

If O
you're O
in O
a O
hurry, O
it's O
the O
perfect O
place! B-TARGET

But O
what O
bothered O
me O
was O
the O
following: O
only O
two O
minutes O
after O
placing O
an O
order, O
we O
were O
already O
served, O
would O
the O
breaded O
cutlets B-TARGET
be O
all O
done O
in O
advance O
and O
then O
warmed O
up? O

The O
prices O
of O
drinks B-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
very O
high O
(4.5 O
euros O
for O
a O
can B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
coca..). I-TARGET

In O
short, O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
extraordinary, O
can O
even O
be O
prepared O
long O
in O
advance? O

I O
will O
not O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
will O
not O
go O
back! O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
very O
Parisian, O
very O
much O
you O
saw O
me! O

waitress B-TARGET
not O
smiling O
and O
unfriendly. O

Very O
medium O
cuisine, B-TARGET
dry O
archi O
crêpe O
chicken B-TARGET
with O
a O
handful O
of O
beans O
and O
all O
for O
an O
exorbitant O
price! O

The O
sandwich B-TARGET
club I-TARGET
has O
nothing O
special O
and O
the O
Vietnamese B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
very O
dry O
without O
any O
sauce. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
overburdened O
but O
it O
makes O
the O
charm O
of O
the O
place. O

I O
went O
there O
by O
chance O
with O
friends O
one O
night O
for O
the O
aperitif O
and O
I O
came O
back O
for O
lunch O
because O
I O
liked O
the O
15€ O
tapas B-TARGET
formula. I-TARGET

You O
will O
not O
find O
the O
pseudo O
tapas O
that O
can O
be O
found O
on O
all O
terraces O
but O
only O
the O
real O
Spanish B-TARGET
recipes: I-TARGET
squid O
rabas, O
jamon O
croquetas O
y O
queso, O
tomato O
bread, O
bacalao O
croquetas, O
tortilla, O
serrano, O
piquillos, O
ink O
squid, O
ham O
artichokes... O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
simply O
delicious O
sangria! B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
like O
the O
rest: O
Catalan O
cream, O
Basque O
cake, O
sheep O
cheese O
and O
black O
cherry O
jam... O

The O
servers B-TARGET
do O
not O
all O
speak O
very O
well O
French O
but O
they O
are O
very O
nice O
(and O
their O
Spanish O
accent O
reinforces O
the O
authentic O
side O
of O
the O
place). B-TARGET

Only O
reproach: O
many O
tables O
and O
little O
space, O
so O
we O
are O
quickly O
narrow. O

But O
I'll O
go O
back O
with O
my O
eyes O
closed! O

15€ O
for O
a O
salad B-TARGET
composed I-TARGET
of O
two O
ingredients: O
green O
salad O
and O
2 O
slices O
of O
smoked O
salmon. O

One O
emerges O
from O
it O
with O
hunger O
and O
the O
bad O
impression O
of O
being O
plucked, O
with O
the O
way O
(Salmon O
is O
arranged O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
it O
hides O
the O
green O
salad O
forest O
that O
gives O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
consistent O
dish). O

If O
you're O
hungry, O
run! O

We O
were O
invited O
yesterday O
by O
Friends O
to O
celebrate O
an O
anniversary O
with O
friends. O

Hesitant O
at O
the O
beginning O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
place, B-TARGET
a O
good O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
good O
tapas B-TARGET
of O
quality O
swallowed, O
we O
finally O
spent O
an O
excellent O
evening O
with O
our O
friends. O

The O
Boss B-TARGET
looks O
RUSTER O
at O
the O
start, O
but O
he O
plays O
a O
"game" O
and O
is O
super O
considerate O
with O
his O
customers! O

A O
simple O
place B-TARGET
or O
have O
a O
pleasant O
evening! O

We O
had O
reserved O
for O
our O
son's O
20th O
birthday O
(April), O
what O
a O
disappointment, O
birthday O
partly O
ruined! O

We O
had O
negotiated O
the O
menu O
with O
the O
manager O
and O
we O
were O
confident O
as O
we O
had O
celebrated O
my O
father-in-law's O
70th O
birthday O
three O
years O
ago O
and O
we O
had O
been O
completely O
satisfied. O

Of O
course O
we O
didn't O
have O
a O
big O
budget, O
15€ O
per O
person O
entering, O
flat, O
cake. O

But O
no O
quality O
on O
the O
plate, B-TARGET
no O
presentation, O
you O
would O
have O
thought O
of O
a O
meal O
you O
made O
at O
home. O

In O
addition, O
among O
our O
plates, B-TARGET
we O
had O
a O
panel O
of O
small O
or O
larger O
pieces O
of O
meat! O

On O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
side, O
it O
was O
raw, O
it O
was O
reported, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
takes O
the O
3 O
plates O
concerned, O
comes O
back O
and O
asks O
us O
who O
the O
plates O
were?!! O

In O
addition, O
annealed O
with O
microwave!!! O
with O
steamed B-TARGET
green I-TARGET
beans, I-TARGET
not O
returned, O
without O
sauce, O
in O
short O
lamentable! O

The O
cake: O
a O
strawberry B-TARGET
tree, O
we O
had O
looked O
for O
strawberries O
and O
disgusting O
too O
much O
cream. O

Luckily O
the O
alcohol-free B-TARGET
cocktails I-TARGET
and O
coffees B-TARGET
were O
good O
and O
offered, O
but O
we O
would O
have O
preferred O
to O
pay O
them O
and O
have O
something O
better O
on O
the O
plate.A B-TARGET
minimum O
of O
presentation O
is O
a O
nothing O
that O
can O
make O
the O
difference O
to O
the O
eye! O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
smiling, O
just O
a O
little O
trouble O
with O
taking O
the O
3 O
plates O
to O
get O
the O
salmon O
but O
otherwise O
nothing O
to O
blame O
her. O

We O
told O
the O
room O
manager, O
he O
was O
very O
embarrassed, O
told O
us O
he O
would O
go O
back O
up. O

We O
learned O
later, O
change O
of O
owner O
and O
cook O
since O
our O
last O
visit. O

Located O
between O
the O
reins O
and O
the O
square O
courtyard, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
does O
not O
deplete. O

Very O
curious O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
sensational, O
I O
burned O
my O
palate O
with O
nems. O

Cantonese B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
was O
dry O
and O
I O
waited O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
minutes O
for O
two O
unfortunate O
ice O
balls. O

Small O
kitchen B-TARGET
of O
small O
quality O
and O
not O
homemade. O

We O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
better O
meal B-TARGET
less O
fast O
and O
with O
more O
taste. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
suggests O
that O
everything O
is O
going O
to O
be O
okay O
but O
nothing O
is O
going O
to O
happen. O

Come O

Reception B-TARGET
of O
the O
most O

almost O

order O
2 O

look O
good O

bathing O

we're O

we O

over. O

After O
tasting O
it's O
the O

a O
pebbly O

my O

I O
call O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
to O
complain, O
no O
excuse, O
for O
her O
it's O
normal O
because O
it's O
a O
fresh O
mushroom O
and O
tells O
us O
that O
next O
time O
they'll O
make O
frozen... O

After O
taking O
us O
away O

asking O
for O
an O

ends O
up O
apologizing O
shyly O

offering O
us O

crowd, O
one O
appreciates O
the O
kindness O
and O
advice O
of O
his O
wife O
and O
son. O

To O
recommend O
to O
lovers O
of O
good O
meat B-TARGET
and O
local O
products. O

Think O
about O
making O
a O
reservation. O

Cathy O
and O
Laurent. O

In O
August O
2014, O
we O
decided O
to O
eat O
pizzas, O
salads O
and O
more O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
disappointed O
by O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Server B-TARGET
exceeded O
while O
the O
terrace O
was O
not O
filled. O

The O
meals O
came O
to O
the O
dropper, O
so O
my O
son O
and O
grandson O
had O
their O
pizzas O
10 O
minutes O
after O
us. O

Very O
disappointed O
by O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET

I O
strongly O
recommend O
lunch O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
with O
spa O
package. O

A O
little O
away O
from O
the O
city O
center, O
serene. O

I O
will O
not O
take O
back O
everything O
that O
has O
been O
said O
because O
everything O
is O
true!!! O

Extremely O
expensive O
price, O
cash O
factory. O

My O
Experience O
took O
place O
around O
a O
question O
to O
one O
of O
the O
servers O
to O
get O
a O
water O
carafe O
after O
consuming O
more O
than O
50 O
euros. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
with O
long O
hair, O
brown, O
thirty, O
hastened O
to O
answer O
me O
in O
a O
very O
despicable O
tone O
that O
at O
chamonix O
the O
water O
is O
paid. O

To O
him O
that O
he O
had O
to O
give O
in O
at O
my O
request O
according O
to O
the O
legislation O
in O
force O
in O
our O
country, O
he O
openly O
ignored O
me, O
and O
just O
proposed O
to O
consult O
the O
management. O

Shameful. O

A O
perfect O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
table, B-TARGET
given O
the O
small O
area O
of O
the O
place, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
good. O

you O
have O
to O
go O
there, O
to O
conclude O
the O
extraordinary O
mountain O
place B-TARGET
at O
3842 O
m. O

Again O
bravo O
for O
the O
leader, O
and O
his O
team. B-TARGET

But O
no O
more. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
nice O
but O
little O
available. O

We O
took O
a O
hot O
stone O
for O
two. O

The O
meats B-TARGET
were O
good O
but O
a O
little O
just O
in O
quantities O
to O
my O
liking. O

The O
homemade O
mayonnaise B-TARGET
sauces I-TARGET
were O
good O
but O
no O
more, O
they O
lacked O
some O
flavors. O

The O
spread B-TARGET
was O
correct. O

Anyway, O
the O
meal B-TARGET
wasn't O
bad, O
but O
I O
wasn't O
packed. O

Divine!! O
Nice O
place O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
very O
nice O
boss B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
bottle B-TARGET
with O
Ca!! O

To O
recommend O
1000 O
times! O

A O
very O
good O
time O
spent O
in O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

My O
wife O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
it. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
chose O
were O
very O
copious. O

Ras O
to O
report O
famous O
for O
two O
months!!! O

It's O
like O
the O
noble O
products B-TARGET
are O
gone. O

There's O
more O
to O
life O
than O
hammock. O

From O
welcome B-TARGET
to O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
everything O
is O
low-end, O
fortunately O
the O
flapper B-TARGET
is O
there O
to O
trap O
tourists O
who O
go O
through O
it. O

A O
VIEW!!! O

very O
good O
product B-TARGET
hamburger B-TARGET
and O
fries B-TARGET
home O
a O
treat B-TARGET
the O
super O
cool O
pattern O
and O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O

beautiful O
location B-TARGET
for O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
what O
a O
deception.... O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
does O
not O
speak O
and O
who O
serves O
you O
without O
announcing O
anything O
on O
the O
kitchen O
side O
nothing O
better O
plates B-TARGET
very O
little O
garnished O
and O
quality O
bof O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
charcuterie I-TARGET
basics O
the O
dish O
andouillette B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
potato I-TARGET
that O
I O
strongly O
recommend..... O
in O
short O
pass O
your O
way...... O

I O
spend O
time, O
1h30 O
for O
a O
simple O
meal. O

A O
super O
simple O
card B-TARGET
but O
a O
completely O
lost O
waitress. B-TARGET

Errors O
in O
ordering O
and O
a O
boss B-TARGET
who O
refuses O
to O
change O
the O
dishes O
on O
the O
pretext O
that O
she O
won't O
throw O
the O
plate O
and O
did O
it O
with O
love O
mdr. O

Apparently O
there O
is O
no O
question O
of O
losing O
money O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
she O
invents O
censored O
pretexts O
to O
pass O
the O
pill.The O
whole O
room O
is O
in O
my O
opinion O
and O
angry. O

English O
people O
on O
the O
terrace O
pay O
before O
the O
end O
and O
leave. O

I'll O
pass O
you O
the O
"takes O
of O
beak" O
with O
the O
boss B-TARGET
to O
make O
her O
understand O
that O
her O
reaction O
is O
intolerable O
and O
non-commercial. O

On O
a O
child's O
menu O
that O
has O
never O
been O
asked, O
she O
has O
the O
nerve O
to O
tell O
me O
when O
the O
check-in, O
that O
she O
offers O
me O
the O
2nd O
ice O
ball O
while O
in O
the O
child's O
menu O
the O
ice O
has O
only O
one O
ball....(No O
comment). O

Restaurant B-TARGET
has O
not O
advised O
and O
above O
all O
to O
banish O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
that O
the O
profession O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
flouted O
by O
this O
kind O
of O
pseudo O
restorer B-TARGET
who O
should O
think O
about O
changing O
the O
profession. O

A O
very O
pink O
but O
pleasant O
setting B-TARGET
for O
dinners O
with O
couples O
or O
friends. O

Very O
well O
presented O
plates B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
welcome B-TARGET
with O
smiling O
people. O

But O
how O
can O
you O
put O
5 O
stars O
at O
an O
Asian O
restaurant O
or O
everything O
is O
just O
warm, O
thawed O
from O
subway O
or O
promocash. O

There's O
even O
fries O
and O
nuggets! O

It's O
really O
very O
disparate! O

In O
short O
very O
well O
to O
take O
a O
tray O
to O
take O
(10€) O
and O
eat O
it O
in O
front O
of O
the O
TV. O

If O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
restaurant, O
go O
your O
way! O

Warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
magnificent O
vaulted O
back B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
(old O
city O
rampart), O
very O
good O
cuisine, B-TARGET
grilled B-TARGET
wood I-TARGET
fire O
casiement O
in O
front O
of O
our O
eyes, O
quality O
products B-TARGET
and O
reasonable O

Not O
to O
be O
missed. O

the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
pleasant; O
the O
correct O
kitchen, B-TARGET
reasonable O
prices, O
in O
short O
it's O
good O
but O
is O
it O
the O
number O
of O
people, O
the O
room,... B-TARGET
there's O
a O
little O
something O
missing O
to O
get O
excited O
about. O

correct. O

but O
an O
impression O
of O
incompleteness. O

We O
are O
there, O
flat O
of O
the O
Tagliatel O
day O
with O
seafood, O
fresh O
produce B-TARGET
but O
some O
rubbery, O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
medium O
welcome, B-TARGET
good O
St B-TARGET
James I-TARGET
but O
very O
dry O
rice, B-TARGET
in O
short O
certainly O
better O
elsewhere! O

We O
discovered O
this O
beach B-TARGET
cabin I-TARGET
by O
chance O
and O
it O
was O
an O
excellent O
surprise: O
a O
warm O
welcome, B-TARGET
very O
correct O
dishes, B-TARGET
a O
lounge-beach O
atmosphere B-TARGET
not O
overrated. O

You O
can O
see O
that O
the O
team B-TARGET
is O
enjoying O
working O
in O
this O
magical O
place. B-TARGET

This O
will O
be O
our O
must O
in O
Cassis! O

Very O
good O
table B-TARGET
in O
an O
alley O
behind O
the O
port O
so O
without O
having O
the O
parade O
of O
tourists O
who O
look O
at O
your O
plate. O

In O
this O
restaurant O
there O
is O
a O
perfumed O
Provencal B-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
presented O
very O
nicely O
and O
in O
generous O
quantity. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
correct O
We O
had O
a O
very O
good O
time O
and O
we O
recommend O
the O
place. B-TARGET

We O
came O
to O
2 O
with O
our O
2-month-old O
baby O
in O
a O
stroller. O

We O
were O
settled O
in O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
restaurant O
that O
we O
ended O
up O
leaving O
after O
20 O
minutes O
without O
anyone O
coming O
to O
bring O
us O
even O
a O
carafe O
of O
water. O

I O
ate O
with O
friends O
in O
this O
restaurant O
and O
I O
find O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
has O
seriously O
deteriorated, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
has O
2 O
leaves, O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
and O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
are O
baked O
in O
the O
presentation. O

In O
addition, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
from O
the O
boss O
is O
cold O
unlike O
very O
nice O
servers. B-TARGET

The O
dishes O
are O
old-fashioned. O

We O
took O
the O
aperitif O
on O
the O
terrace. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
were O
rather O
pleasant O
but O
not O
a O
peanut O
or O
olive O
at O
the O
hour O
of O
the O
aperitif O
unfortunately, O
no O
aperitif O
plate O
either. O

Incomprehensible O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
bar... I-TARGET

How O
can O
we O
call O
it O
a O
restaurant? B-TARGET

A O
deplorable O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
a O
mediocre O
cuisine B-TARGET
having O
nothing O
to O
envy O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
freshness O
of O
the O
buffet B-TARGET
in O
particular. O

The O
next O
time O
we're O
in O
Albertville, O
we'll O
try O
another O
restaurant, O
can O
anyone O
advise O
us O
one??? O

In O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
I O
felt O
at O
home O
having O
had O
a O
restaurant O
of O
the O
same O
kind. O

A O
tasty O
cuisine B-TARGET
made O
with O
love, O
I O
go O
back O
there O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
can O
for O
myself O
it's O
a O
real O
restaurant B-TARGET

We O
came O
to O
14 O
people O
for O
my O
boyfriend's O
birthday. O

We O
arrived O
around O
8 O
p.m. O
to O
9 O
p.m. O

We O
all O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
very O
wide, O
good O
hot O
and O
good O
dishes! B-TARGET

we O
have O
ordered O
5 O
bottles O
of O
champagne O
+ O
4 O
bottles O
of O
wine O
with O
dinner O
+ O
digestives O
+ O
coffees. O

no O
commercial O
gestures O
to O
payment, O
nothing O
offered O
or O
proposed...??! O

In O
addition, O
one O
of O
the O
people O
to O
order O
a O
tartar, O
it O
was O
served O
10 O
minutes O
after O
everyone.. O
it's O
a O
cold O
dish O
yet. O

That's O
too O
bad! O

We O
arrive O
at O
5 O
for O
lunch O
last O
Sunday O
around O
1:30 O
p.m. O

It's O
the O
end O
of O
service. O

Entrance: O
cold O
smelt O
frying O
for O
one O
of O
us. O

Three O
casseroles O
of O
marinate O
mussels O
arrive O
at O
the O
table, O
at O
the O
opening, O
the O
mussels B-TARGET
of O
one O
of O
them O
are O
covered O
with O
tomatoes O
and O
not O
the O
others. O

We O
ask O
the O
server O
if O
this O
is O
normal. O

After O
checking, O
he O
comes O
back O
and O
tells O
us O
that O
it's O
about O
decoration. O

Some O
mussels B-TARGET
are O
overcooked O
others O
not O
enough. O

Fries B-TARGET
taste O
like O
oil. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
my O
marinate B-TARGET
mussel I-TARGET
casserole I-TARGET
I O
have O
the O
unpleasant O
surprise O
to O
find O
a O
half O
lemon, O
skin O
included, O
shredded. O

I'm O
asking O
the O
waiter O
if O
there's O
any O
problem. O

He O
comes O
back O
after O
checking O
and O
tells O
me O
that O
this O
is O
the O
recipe O
for O
the O
mussels. O

I'm O
asking O
to O
see O
who's O
in O
charge. O

It O
happens O
and O
when O
I O
tell O
him O
of O
my O
discontent O
asks O
me O
to O
"put O
down O
in O
a O
tone". O

We O
immediately O
stop O
eating. O

The O
note O
before O
us O
is O
deflated O
with O
a O
casserole O
while O
no O
one O
wants O
to O
eat O
these O
dubious O
mussels. B-TARGET

We O
will O
then O
be O
insulted O
again O
by O
the O
manager B-TARGET
before O
he O
agrees O
to O
cash O
in O
our O
drinks O
and O
let O
us O
go. O

We O
did O
not O
expect O
great O
cuisine O
in O
this O
very O
touristic O
place B-TARGET
but O
we O
would O
nevertheless O
have O
enjoyed O
being O
able O
to O
lunch O
without O
endangering O
our O
health O
and O
without O
being O
disrespected O
over O
the O
market! O

Go O
to O
the O
competitors O
there O
are O
very O
many O
in O
the O
area!!!! O

First O
time O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
we O
were O
told O
was O
good. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
offered O
are O
original, O
the O
flavours O
are O
interesting O
but O
the O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
not O
at O
the O
rendezvous. O

18,50 O
€ O
a O
risotto, B-TARGET
where O
I O
looked O
for O
smoked O
salmon O
yet O
announced, O
which O
I O
unfortunately O
did O
not O
find, O
it O
is O
far O
too O
expensive O
as O
good O
as O
it O
is. O

We O
paid O
for O
the O
colourful O
setting B-TARGET
and O
the O
tourist B-TARGET
port I-TARGET
of O
La O
Cotinière. O

If O
there O
was O
only O
one O
thing O
that O
could O
have O
been O
okay, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
catastrophic. O

The O
young O
blonde O
lady O
who O
served O
us O
is O
absolutely O
no O
business. O

Ordering O
by O
the O
boss B-TARGET
came O
long O
after O
the O
end O
of O
the O
aperitif, O
and O
the O
worst O
was O
the O
wine B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
when O
we O
almost O
finished O
our O
dish. O

Intolerable. O

Despite O
a O
tasty O
kitchen, B-TARGET
we O
won't O
go O
back. O

Very O
nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Small O
room O
atmosphere B-TARGET
beach O
Oleronaise. O

Deco B-TARGET
and O
refined O
tables O
(clothes O
and O
towels O
in O
fabrics...). O

Very O
smiling O
and O
warm O
staff. B-TARGET

Menus B-TARGET
a O
little O
expensive O
but O
very O
good. O

That O
said O
for O
everything O
made O
home O
with O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
of O
very O
good O
quality O
that O
remains O
very O
interesting. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
rich O
and O
well O
presented. O

Very O
good, O
especially O
desserts B-TARGET
(excellent). O

Cots B-TARGET
very O
good O
but O
a O
little O
expensive O
for O
the O
quantity O
(5/8€) O

Restaurant B-TARGET
open O
out O
of O
season. O

Terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
shade O
of O
very O
pleasant O
trees, O
nice O
plates, B-TARGET
well O
prepared O
fish, B-TARGET
nice O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Don't O
hesitate. O

The O
address O
is O
misleading, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
in O
Castelnaudary O
but O
in O
a O
small O
village O
just O
after. O

Call O
the O
boss B-TARGET
to O
find O
out, O
she's O
adorable. O

And O
make O
a O
detour, O
for O
a O
top O
and O
generous O
cassoulet. B-TARGET

With O
a O
little O
glass B-TARGET
of O
Minervois. O

AND O
a O
little O
fat B-TARGET
just O
before. O

It's O
not O
for O
the O
diet. O

But O
when O
you O
eat O
well O
and O
well, O
you O
don't O
get O
fat. O

It O
is O
a O
pleasant O
stop, O
for O
us O
who O
came O
back O
from O
Bordeaux O
and O
returned O
to O
the O
South O
East O
(the O
boss O
will O
no O
doubt O
recognize!). O

We O
had O
a O
good O
end O
to O
the O
evening... O
or O
at O
night. O

Thank O
you. O

friendly B-TARGET
welcome, O
kitchen B-TARGET
of O
very O
good O
quality O
but O
sometimes O
the O
hand O
is O
a O
little O
heavy O
on O
the O
salt, O
little O
problem O
corrected O
since. O

We O
recommend! O

A O
frankly O
"infected" O
cassoulet, B-TARGET
which O
shames O
the O
name O
worn O
by O
the O
restaurant O
and O
for O
a O
so-called O
"traditional O
restaurant O
serving O
a O
Chef O
cuisine B-TARGET
made O
from O
gross O
product" O
(sic)... O
called O
"Cassoulet O
fait O
Maison"!. O

Boss O
came O
to O
see O
us O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
service, O
we O
were O
the O
first O
customers O
to O
have O
the O
courage O
to O
settle O
down O
on O
his O
terrace, O
while O
the O
terrace O
tables O
of O
the O
nearby O
restaurants O
were O
occupied...First O
arrived, O
before O
last O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
the O
check-in, O
after O
call. O

Avoid O
both O
for O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
service. B-TARGET

I'm O
sorry. O

A O
great O
mistake O
of O
choice O
from O
us. O

Don't O
be O
like O
us! O

Meals B-TARGET
totally O
disappointing O
and O
expensive! O

For O
two O
entrances, O
two O
dishes O
and O
two O
à O
la O
carte O
desserts O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
we O
found O
the O
meal B-TARGET
rather O
expensive O
for O
Castelnaudary O
(92€). O

In O
addition O
everything O
came O
from O
canned O
foods O
or O
they O
were O
frozen O
dishes... B-TARGET

I O
totally O
advise O
against O
this O
"restaurant". B-TARGET

Nice O
location. O

Nice O
service. B-TARGET

Pizza B-TARGET
honest O
but O
avoid O
tiramisu. B-TARGET

Be O
careful O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
Italian... O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
know!. O

Excellent O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
search. O

Bravo O
for O
the O
chef O
and O
the O
pastry; O
we O
will O
come O
back O
for O
the O
language B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Boeuf! I-TARGET

Very O
good O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
in O
a O
typical O
place. O

But O
it's O
expensive. O

We O
only O
had O
one O
dish. O

Too O
bad O
about O
this O
nice O
little O
restaurant. B-TARGET

But O
there O
are O
others O
as O
good O
and O
cheaper. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
is O
just O
indecent! O

Nothing O
good O
even O
the O
potato B-TARGET
was O
not O
cooked! O

Don't O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
well, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
we O
let O
ourselves O
get O
into O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
those O
years. O

You O
don't O
have O
to O
ask O
for O
anything O
other O
than O
the O
boss's O
registry, O
otherwise O
you're O
told O
to O
go O
buy O
the O
cd. O
