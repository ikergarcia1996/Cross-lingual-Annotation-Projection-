A O
passable O
service.. B-TARGET
Surcooked O
dishes, B-TARGET
sauces B-TARGET
frozen O
in O
their O
pot O
(we O
wonder O
if O
they O
were O
not O
on O
other O
tables O
before O
we O
were O
served), O
the O
price O
is O
correct O
but O
the O
taste O
is O
not O
at O
the O
rendezvous... O
very O
disappointed O
by O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET

We O
enjoyed O
the O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
on O
the O
main O
promenade B-TARGET
of O
Narbonne-Plage, O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service. B-TARGET

We'll O
come O
back! O

we O
expected O
better O
(waiting, B-TARGET
average O
quality). O

Not O
bad, O
but O
no O
more. O

We O
don't O
think O
we're O
going O
back. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
keep O
for O
yourself O
stunning O
views B-TARGET
of O
the O
hippodrome O
and O
the O
golf O
course O
think O
to O
book O
down O
near O
the O
bay O
windows O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
good O
and O
in O
addition O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
with O
the O
smile O

A O
little O
lady O
greets O
us O
without O
a O
smile O
but O
especially O
without O
enthusiasm, O
it O
must O
have O
pissed O
her O
off O
to O
have O
customers O
on O
Tuesday O
night.... O
3 O
tables. O

Anyway, O
let's... O

We O
still O
order, O
pastry B-TARGET
lasagna, I-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
tasteless O
cheese B-TARGET
on O
the O
top, O
which O
reduced O
the O
acidity O
of O
the O
tomato B-TARGET
concentrate...! I-TARGET

Dessert B-TARGET
everything O
except O
house....! O

I O
really O
don't O
recommend, O
even O
if O
your O
fridge O
is O
empty O
and O
the O
other O
restaurants O
next O
door O
are O
full O
and O
you O
don't O
know O
where O
to O
go..... O

It's O
better O
to O
go O
to O
McDo! O

Really O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised! O

The O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
is O
very O
good O
and O
well O
served! O

Always O
very O
original, O
you O
drop O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
you O
won't O
see O
anywhere O
else. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
table I-TARGET
really O
makes O
you O
want, O
we O
cut O
you O
a O
lot O
of O
gourmet B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
or O
fresh O
cake, B-TARGET
homemade! O

You O
feel O
a O
bit O
like O
at O
home O
with O
the O
high O
quality! O

And O
the O
team B-TARGET
is O
adorable! O

Also O
go O
for O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
that O
is O
very O
pretty! O

amazing O
concept O
at O
the O
beginning O
but O
very O
efficacious O
because O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
friendly O
place!! B-TARGET
tartar B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
homemade O
fries B-TARGET
are O
at O
will O
for O
a O
price O
everything O
has O
done O
right! O

All O
right. O

2 O
hours O
of O
expectations B-TARGET
minumum O
no O
service B-TARGET
and O
boss B-TARGET
execrable! O

So O
much O
decu O
has O
to O
strongly O
advise!! O

The O
old O
bosses O
didn't O
have O
anything, O
the O
boss O
ny O
knows O
nothing O
about O
restoration. O

located O
in O
the O
small O
Venice O
with O
terrace B-TARGET
by I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
water, I-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
seemed O
ideal O
for O
this O
day O
spent O
in O
Colmar. O

Then O
we O
were, O
say, O
surprised O
by O
the O
welcome. B-TARGET

A O
rather O
disdainful O
character O
welcomed O
us O
against O
heart O
in O
view O
of O
his O
attitude. O

Even O
though O
the O
meal B-TARGET
was O
quite O
copious O
and O
good, O
we O
did O
not O
enjoy O
as O
much O
as O
the O
place B-TARGET
gave O
us O
hope. O

Was O
this O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
that O
wanted O
this? O

Apart O
from O
this O
character, O
the O
other O
people O
in O
this O
restaurant O
were O
courteous O
and O
very O
affable.. O

At O
first O
it O
was O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
then O
little O
by O
little O
it O
dropped O
in O
quality O
without O
stops! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
medium, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
also O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
quality O
and O
quantity O

We've O
been O
used O
to O
the O
establishment O
for O
3 O
years, O
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
just O
getting O
better. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
worked O
and O
changed O
regularly, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
professional, O
attentive O
and O
charming. O

Never O
disappointed O
in O
three O
years. O

Go O
on! O

We O
went O
there O
by O
chance O
and O
were O
not O
disappointed! O

The O
warmth O
of O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
and O
the O
servers B-TARGET
contribute O
to O
a O
certain O
well-being!! O

Despite O
the O
present O
world, O
we O
were O
quickly O
served. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
wine B-TARGET
offered O
were O
succulent. O

We'll O
go O
back! O

We've O
got O
a O
bad O
welcome. B-TARGET

Interminable O
expectation! B-TARGET

First O
dish O
served: O
insects O
present! O

We O
alert O
the O
personnel B-TARGET
who O
blame O
us O
(insects O
coming O
from O
the O
outside). O

We're O
giving O
a O
second O
chance. O

Second O
dish O
served: O
more O
INSECTES. O

Staff O
response: O
"If O
you O
didn't O
want O
insects, O
you O
had O
to O
eat O
inside!" O

I O
strongly O
advise O
against O
it! O

I O
rarely O
eat O
the O
dishes O
of O
the O
day O
in O
the O
restaurants O
where O
I O
go O
but O
I O
made O
an O
exception O
this O
time. O

The O
people O
I O
was O
having O
lunch O
with O
ordered O
the O
Pdj O
and O
so O
I O
did O
like O
them O
not O
to O
delay O
us. O

It O
was O
of O
excellent O
value O
for O
money O
and O
very O
good O
in O
addition. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
made O
by O
the O
boss O
is O
always O
smiling O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
dynamic O
and O
professional O
service. O

Knowing O
her O
husband's O
cooking B-TARGET
well, O
I'm O
not O
surprised O
at O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
has O
just O
been O
restored O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
and O
the O
half-timbered B-TARGET
house I-TARGET
that O
houses O
the O
restaurant O
has O
also O
been O
renovated, O
in O
short: O
Only O
positive. O

Small O
restaurant O
with O
neat O
decor, B-TARGET
well-placed O
tables. O

The O
reception B-TARGET
lacks O
a O
bit O
of O
warmth, O
the O
service B-TARGET
that O
will O
also O
follow. O

The O
different O
menus B-TARGET
based O
on O
"Mezzés" O
are O
similar, O
the O
specialties O
are O
successful O
for O
some O
( O
hummous, B-TARGET
taboulé..), B-TARGET
less O
successful O
for O
others O
like O
for O
example O
eggplant B-TARGET
puree I-TARGET
rather O
bland O
or O
these O
pellets B-TARGET
having O
a O
"burned" O
aftertaste. O

We O
are O
in O
the O
classic O
of O
the O
genre O
with O
little O
surprise O
and O
rather O
high O
prices. O

Special O
mention O
however O
to O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
(Lebanese) O
and O
to O
the O
gesture O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
offered O
some O
of O
the O
desserts. O

Come O
on, O
a O
good O
evening O
anyway, O
but O
a O
desired O
effort O
on O
Mediterranean O
tastes O
and O
flavors! O

Don't O
miss O
it! O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
any O
point O
of O
view O
the O
service B-TARGET
the O
boss B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
the O
excellent O
dishes B-TARGET
the O
wine B-TARGET
very O
good! O

Tourists O
passing O
through O
the O
corner O
we O
will O
come O
back O
without O
hesitation O
next O
time O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants B-TARGET
made O
in O
a O
long O
time O

Tapas O
bar O
in O
the O
evening, O
changing O
and O
sometimes O
approximate O
decoration. B-TARGET

The O
wines B-TARGET
are O
good O
but O
not O
excellent, O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
when O
there O
are O
still O
good O
ones, O
fortunately O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
wanted O
to O
push O
the O
door O
of O
this O
place O
into O
the O
Bayonne O
port O
area O
and O
here O
we O
did!!! O

The O
decor B-TARGET
could O
be O
revisited O
but O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
good O
the O
order O
take O
is O
fast O
and O
very O
smiling. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
classic O
but O
correct O
with O
a O
price O
that O
is O
also O
correct.Then O
comes O
the O
musical B-TARGET
atmosphere I-TARGET
that O
corresponds O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
one O
makes O
of O
its O
places. O

Good O
night O
spent O
in O
this O
place B-TARGET

Chewing O
gum-style O
beef, B-TARGET
soft O
dark O
brown O
fries B-TARGET
and O
still O
bathe O
in O
their O
oil. O

Austere O
service. B-TARGET

What O
more O
can O
I O
say? O

We O
rarely O
ate O
so O
badly O
in O
Bordeaux. O

Already O
there O
is O
a O
big O
missed O
hygiene O
level: O
the O
cook O
goes O
out O
with O
his O
gloves O
and O
then O
goes O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen O
without O
changing O
them... O

Then, O
uncooked O
meat B-TARGET
and O
soft O
fries.... B-TARGET
(ill O
the O
next O
day) O

At O
night O
no O
menu O
so O
it O
comes O
back O
super O
expensive O
(quality O
ratio O
\prix O
we O
don't O
find O
it O
in O
my O
opinion). O

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
original O
and O
attractive O
and O
the O
products B-TARGET
of O
quality, O
unfortunately O
the O
note O
is O
far O
too O
salty O
compared O
to O
the O
experience O
delivered. O

Indeed, O
the O
rather O
heavy O
welcome B-TARGET
gives O
way O
to O
a O
service B-TARGET
lacking O
of O
enthusiasm O
and O
smile. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
good, O
well O
cooked O
and O
presented O
but O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
are O
rather O
high O
and O
in O
the O
end, O
the O
note O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
in O
step O
with O
the O
experience O
lived O
(more O
than O
100€ O
to O
two O
for O
1 O
entrance/2 O
dishes/1 O
dessert O
with O
wine O
and O
coffee), O
in O
a O
rather O
successful O
vintage/rustic O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
but O
spoiled O
by O
pop/variet O
music B-TARGET
unrelated O
to O
the O
frame O
and O
concept, O
broadcast O
a O
little O
too O
loud O
for O
a O
restaurant O
where O
we O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
moment O
of O
calm O
and O
relaxation. O

My O
favourite O
of O
the O
year O
2014. O

Cheese O
lover, O
when O
I O
went O
down O
to O
the O
cheese B-TARGET
cellar, I-TARGET
in O
unlimited O
access, O
with O
more O
than O
200 O
cheeses O
to O
taste, O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
in O
heaven O
for O
32€. O

Add O
to O
this O
a O
binne O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
nuts I-TARGET
and O
bread O
with O
figs, O
bacon O
and O
I O
pass, O
plus O
a O
nice O
service, B-TARGET
I O
spent O
an O
excellent O
time O
at O
every O
passage O
here O
(my O
first O
visit O
called O
others). O

Possibility O
to O
eat O
à O

the O
theme O

Very O
nice O

20/20 O
for O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
very O
nice O
stage O
evening O
with O
a O
welcoming O
reception. B-TARGET

Simple O
but O
effective O
for O
an O
evening O
meal, O
to O
discover O
but O
at O
noon O
it O
must O
be O
good. O

There O
were O
five O
of O
us O
for O
business O
dinners O
all O
went O
very O
well O
we O
all O
found O
our O
dishes B-TARGET
excellent, O
we O
will O
come O
back O
with O
pleasure. O

Venus, O
like O
every O
year O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time, O
for O
my O
birthday, O
I O
had O
booked O
on O
the O
internet. O

We're O
coming, O
the O
manager O
can't O
find O
us O
on O
the O
reservations. O

He O
tells O
us O
that O
he O
no O
longer O
looks O
at O
the O
internet...Why O
propose O
the O
option O
in O
this O
case?????? O

And O
we're O
in O
the O
box O
where O
he O
can... O

Bread B-TARGET
from O
the O
burnt O
buffet, O
we O
are O
told O
that O
it O
is O
normal...A O
waitress B-TARGET
of O
a O
certain O
age O
very O
unpleasant O
and O
rushed O
to O
see O
the O
guests O
leave, O
not O
even O
finished O
the O
entrance, O
we O
take O
the O
dish, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
tell O
you O
the O
reflections O
of O
a O
doubtful O
gout. O

It's O
changed O
a O
lot, O
we'll O
never O
get O
back O
on O
it O
again... O

I O
hadn't O
come O
back O
for O
15 O
years. O

Very O

the O

Very O
long O

the O

who O
tells O
her O

while O
the O

is O
crowded O
and O
everyone O
is O
waiting, O
mistakes O
in O
the O

We O
have O
been O

several O

and O
we O
have O
never O

but O
the O
service B-TARGET
on O

deplorable... O

Yet O
the O

Guest O
for O
a O
professional O
dinner O
(group O
of O
20 O
people) O
we O
were O
presented O
this O
restaurant O
as O
a O
good O
address O
of O
the O
city. O

So O
it O
was O
with O
the O
mouth O
water O
that O
we O
were O
received O
in O
this O
establishment. O

Complete O
menu O
of O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money O
(products B-TARGET
offered, O
cooking O
and O
presentation O
of O
plates) B-TARGET
and O
fast O
service B-TARGET
but O
you O
need O
to O
improve O
some O
points O
to O
be O
a O
good O
restaurant: B-TARGET
maintenance O
of O
sanitary O
appliances O
in O
the O
"water O
room", O
warmth O
of O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
choice O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
offered O
(I O
just O
saw O
on O
tripadvisor O
that O
it O
was O
a O
wine O
bar, O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
concept O
then) O

Little O
restaurant B-TARGET
suggested O
by O
a O
friend, O
we O
don't O
regret O
the O
experience! O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
offered O
according O
to O
arrival, O
concise O
menu B-TARGET
but O
extremely O
tasty O
dishes. B-TARGET

To O
be O
recommended O
absolutely. O

Really O
an O
address B-TARGET
to O
remember O
for O
meat O
lovers, O
a O
rib B-TARGET
that O
melts O
in O
the O
mouth, O
a O
simple O
but O
tasty O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
a O
glass O
of O
good O
quality O
wine. B-TARGET

Really O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
address. B-TARGET

I O
loved O
everything... O
:-) O

Reception O
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
pleasant O
and O
efficient O

All O

a O
special O

Restaurant B-TARGET
packed O
at O
noon O
better O
to O
arrive O
early O

Cool O
welcome, B-TARGET
barely O
installed O
and O
the O
card O
in O
hand O
that O
we O
come O
to O
order. O

Count O
three O
quarters O
of O
an O
hour O
to O
have O
only O
the O
dish. O

In O
fact, O
flat O
which O
is O
grossly O
handed O
to O
us O
from O
hand O
to O
hand. O

I O
don't O
call O
it O
a O
restaurant O
service. B-TARGET

A O
meat B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
cooked O
as O
we O
ask: O
bleeding O
and O
not O
at O
the O
point O
as O
requested. O

No O
dessert O
orders O
were O
taken O
after O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dish. O

So O
we O
decided O
to O
leave O
without O
dessert! O

Departure B-TARGET
as O
unpleasant O
as O
reception. B-TARGET

Disappointed O
from O
our O
evening O
because O
I've O
known O
this O
tavern B-TARGET
in O
better O
days. O

Much O
too O
expensive O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

A O
quality/price B-TARGET
ratio O
which O
therefore O
takes O
place O
without O
comment. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
+++. O

We O
rarely O
ate O
such O
mediocre O
pizza... B-TARGET
uncooked, O
poorly O
garnished,... O

AFFREUX!!! O

Atypical O
boss B-TARGET
but O
to O
know. O

very O
listening!! O

First O
time O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
kitchen O
in O
the O
restaurants O
I O
frequent O
in O
Rennes, O
a O
shame. O

A O
nice O

I O
am O
refused O
to O
correct O
the O
shot O
on O
a O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
served O
more O
generously O
previously O
(at O
5.90€ O
a O
glass, O
the O
behaviour O
of O
the O
boss B-TARGET
(?) O
is O
disappointing). O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
good, O
well O
cooked O
as O
requested. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
are O
soft, O
too, O
for O
a O
restaurant O
that O
serves O
dishes B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
potatoes. O

In O
short O
a O
formula B-TARGET
at O
correct O
prices O
for O
city O
center, O
a O
real O
potential O
but O
lack O
of O
commercial O

and O

still O
damages, O

welcome B-TARGET

A O
boss O
who O
could O
be O
a O
school O
case O
in O
hotel O
schools. O

He O
doesn't O
say O
hello, O
lower O
his O
head, O
don't O
look O
into O
your O
eyes O
and O
give O
that O
feeling O
that O
you're O
bothering O
him. O

I O
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
thanking O
him O
for O
the O
service O
and O
apologizing O
for O
disturbing O
him O
during O
his O
work. O

He O
said O
it O
bothered O
him O
to O
work O
on O
a O
Sunday. O

I O
live O
in O
Dijon O
and O
this O
is O
the O
last O
time O
I've O
ever O
been O
there. O

We O
always O
appreciate O
to O
eat O
"in O
Italian" O
in O
this O
very O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Dijon. O

But O
the O
last O
time, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
less O
good: O
pizza B-TARGET
dough I-TARGET
was O
difficult O
to O
cut, O
should O
not O
the O
boss O
buy O
new O
knives, O
because O
IKEA's O
knives O
leave O
something O
to O
be O
desired O
for O
this O
son-in-law O
of O
dishes. O

And O
always O
as O
difficult O
to O
come O
to O
eat O
without O
having O
booked! O

On O
the O
square B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Bareuzay, I-TARGET
symbolic O
of O
Dijon, O
a O
pleasant O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
banal, O
with O
a O
classic O
"Burgundy O
dishes" O
option. O

A O
very O
limited O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wines, I-TARGET
both O
in O
quantity O
and O
quality. O

We O
took O
a O
mustard O
dijonnaise O
sauce O
and O
its O
accompaniment O
of O
fries O
and O
an O
andouillette O
with O
small O
vegetables O
and O
puree. O

The O
andouillette B-TARGET
that O
was O
not O
a O
5A O
was O
excellent, O
fries, B-TARGET
vegetables B-TARGET
and O
purée B-TARGET
as O
well. O

Overall O
satisfactory. O

There's O
nothing O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
service B-TARGET
unless O
it's O
the O
rush O
to O
close O
the O
shop! O

On O
the O
shape: O
the O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
rather O
well O
decorated, O
bright O
and O
pleasant, O
quite O
in O
the O
American O
style. O

The O
person O
in O
charge B-TARGET
is O
smiling O
and O
welcoming, O
even O
though O
he O
sometimes O
does O
a O
little O
too O
much, O
but O
it's O
better O
like O
that. O

In O
the O
background: O
I O
have O
been O
there O
twice O
in O
the O
last O
3 O
months O
to O
eat O
a O
hamburger O
and O
frankly O
the O
content O
of O
the O
plate B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
price O
and O
it O
is O
really O
on O
this O
point O
that O
the O
problem O
lies. O

The O
hamburgers B-TARGET
are O
sold O
between O
12 O
and O
16 O
euros O
which O
is O
far O
too O
much O
for O
very O
industrial O
preparations: B-TARGET
bread B-TARGET
hardened O
by O
cooking, O
no O
vegetables O
in O
the O
sandwich B-TARGET
and O
fries B-TARGET
that O
are O
not O
homemade. O

In O
short, O
this O
facility O
is O
a O
bit O
like O
Canada O
Dry, O
it O
looks O
like O
it's O
not.... O

An O
old O
experience O
at O
this O
establishment O
in O
2013 O
made O
me O
want O
to O
go O
back O

If O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
the O
setting B-TARGET
are O
nice, O
don't O
be O
in O
a O
hurry, O
2h30 O
for O
the O
menus O
of O
the O
day, O
it O
starts O
to O
do O

In O
addition O
7 O
euros O
50 O
for O
two O
eggs B-TARGET
mimosa I-TARGET
without O
fioritures O
is O
simply O
flight O

I O
pass O
you O
the O
lukewarm O
and O
unsatisfied O
dishes B-TARGET

The O
coffee O
offered O
can't O
erase O
everything O

So O
disappointed O
with O
my O
second O
experience, O
my O
wallet O
will O
remember. O

We O
had O
lunch O
at O
this O
family O
restaurant. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
user-friendly, O
staff B-TARGET
are O
pleasant. O

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
generous. O

Having O
been O
able O
to O
taste O
the O
mountain B-TARGET
crepe, I-TARGET
it O
is O
copious O
and O
well-stocked. O

The O
cider, B-TARGET
not O
only O
exceptional, O
is O
fresh O
and O
is O
accompanied O
well. O

When O
at O
the O
price, O
I O
do O
not O
find O
them O
excessive O
when O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
served. O

To O
do O
with O
family, O
couple O
or O
friends O

Very O
nice O
decoration. B-TARGET

the O
place B-TARGET
has O
a O
felted O
light, O
it O
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
very O
relaxing. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
nickel. O

Very O
disappointed: O
Crockery, B-TARGET
decor B-TARGET
a O
little O
old-fashioned. O

Spider O
webs, O
not O
very O
clean O
tablecloth. O

On O
the O
meal O
side O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
twice O
to O
have O
the O
wine O
we O
had O
taken O
as O
an O
aperitif. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
not O
served O
at O
the O
right O
temperature. O

Beautiful O
glasses O
would O
have O
been O
appreciated O
to O
drink O
a O
good O
wine. B-TARGET

For O
the O
dish O
the O
waiter O
told O
us O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
served O
with O
a O
foie O
gras O
sauce, O
we O
did O
not O
find O
the O
taste O
of O
foie O
gras O
because O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
a O
wine B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
that O
completely O
masked O
foie O
gras. O

For O
the O
farandole O
dessert O
of B-TARGET
desserts: I-TARGET
nothing O
extraordinary O
but O
classics O
with O
lots O
of O
butter O
cream. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
you O
do O
not O
come O
out O
with O
hunger O
because O
it O
is O
copious. O

In O
conclusion O
far O
too O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
ate: O
lack O
of O
originality O
and O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
task. O

We O
can O
only O
say O
good O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
simply O
amazing O
/ O
the O
unique O
menu B-TARGET
at O
36 O
euros O
makes O
you O
discover O
some O
typical O
Corsican O
dishes.... O

Attention O
pantagruelic O
menu... B-TARGET

Great O
grandma's O
kitchen B-TARGET
that O
cares O
about O
the O
body. O

And O
to O
crown O
the O
whole O
friendly O
waiters B-TARGET
has O
the O
accent O
pronounced O
with O
always O
a O
bit O
of O
humor. O

Frankly... O
when O
we O
come O
from O
the O
Basque O
country... O

We O
like O
the O
heat O
of O
Corsica O
like O
that! O

Bravo. O

Not O
bad. O

Dry O
pizza, B-TARGET
very O
few O
ingredients O
and O
a O
dry O
enoormous O
edge O
for O
Regina O
bianca. O

It O
certainly O
isn't O
worth O
the O
price... O

Small O
nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
during O
our O
2h O
stopover O
after O
our O
boat O
ride. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
was O
correct O
for O
a O
quick O
stopover, O
the O
very O
friendly O
boss B-TARGET
and O
the O
beautiful O
landscape. B-TARGET

Really O
horrible O
things B-TARGET
are O
warmed O
up, O
some O
not O
cooked, O
you O
can't O
call O
it O
cooking! O

Really O
sucks! O

excellent O
burgers, B-TARGET
we're O
addicted O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
tasted. O

The O
" O
complete B-TARGET
" O
is O
famous, O
up O
to O
the O
" O
samurai B-TARGET
" O
of O
its O
competitor O
the O
bigban. B-TARGET

I O
miss O
it! O

unique O
in O
Besançon. O

Besides, O
the O
cook B-TARGET
is O
adorable. O

Take O
away O
only. O

Yeah, O
we're O
warned, O

Yes, O
it's O
fresh. O

Yeah, O
it's O
pretty O
hot. O

But O
then: O

The O
announced O
complexity O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
where O
is O
it? O

It's O
not O
to O
fall O
to O
the O
ground O

There O
may O
be O
"on-stage" O
sauces B-TARGET
in O
kitchen O
dishes O

In O
short, O
nothing O
that O
justifies O
3 O
hours O
at O
the O
table O
for O
2 O
dishes O
for O
4 O
people, O
if O
not O
a O
good O
way O
to O
stand O
out O
from O
the O
other O
Vietnam/Thai O
restaurants. O

Good O
com! O

Home B-TARGET
zero O

REFUSED O
OF O
THE O
PASTIME O
as O
they O
are O
in O
and O
notified O
upon O
reservation O
and O
upon O
arrival. O

It's O
a O
BEAUTIFUL O
ARNAQUE!!!! O

On O
December O
20, O
2014, O
we O
got O
INSTALLED O
by O
the O
head B-TARGET
of O
the O
company!!!! O

Too O
bad O
for O
the O
bosses O
who O
lose O
people O
because O
of O
the O
employee B-TARGET
who O
thinks O
he's O
a O
boss! O

A O
very O
nice O
young O
waiter B-TARGET
I O
complain! O

ADIEU!!! O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
really O
nice O
and O
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
which O
contrasts O
with O
the O
lack O
of O
friendliness O
of O
one O
of O
the O
rather O
unpleasant O
waitresses B-TARGET
and O
master O
in O
the O
art O
of O
making O
reflections O
to O
the O
clientele. O

The O
other O
waitress O
being, O
for O
her O
part, O
very O
left O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

And O
to O
perfect O
all O
the O
very O
strong O
music B-TARGET
of O
the O
lounge O
space O
prevents O
any O
conversation O
between O
the O
guests O
which O
is O
a O
pity O
because O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good O
as O
a O
whole O
except O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
that O
have O
been O
sold O
to O
us O
as O
home-made O
desserts O
but O
that O
seem O
rather O
out O
of O
Metro O
or O
other O
food O
suppliers! O

To O
conclude O
the O
map O
has O
some O
spelling O
errors. O

Little O
could O
be O
done O
to O
improve O
the O
overall O
picture. O

A O
simple O
kitchen B-TARGET
with O
fresh O
and O
home O
cooked O
products. B-TARGET

Warm O
welcome. B-TARGET

Even O
the O
little O
biscuits B-TARGET
that O
accompany O
the O
coffee O
are O
homemade. O

Nothing O
to O
say, O
simple O
but O
very O
good O
and O
very O
fresh. O

Welcome B-TARGET
to O
the O
top! O

Restaurant B-TARGET
without O
pretention O
according O
to O
the O
front O
but O
with O
a O
quality O
kitchen! B-TARGET

Kir O
offered O
with O
an O
appetit O
bet O
with O
rillettes O
and O
sausage. O

There O
are O
few O
choices O
to O
the O
à O
la O
carte, B-TARGET
but O
that's O
also O
how O
we're O
more O
likely O
to O
make O
good O
dishes! B-TARGET

And O
it's O
a O
success! O

It's O
my O
canteen. O
I O
love O
it! O

Go O
on O
like O
this, O
I O
encourage O
you O
warmly! O

A O
friendly O
room, B-TARGET
a O
very O
young O
staff, B-TARGET
pleasant, O
at O
the O
bar O
as O
well O
as O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
price-quality O
ratio O
remains O
tense, O
a O
little O
expensive O
for O
meals, B-TARGET
even O
if O
the O
space B-TARGET
is O
interesting, O
between O
the O
trees. O

The O
interest O
would O
be O
to O
discover O
young O
artists O
who O
regularly O
perform O
there. O

Unfortunately, O
they O
are O
hardly O
respected: O
poor O
acoustics, O
noisy O
audience. O

The O
managers O
should O
be O
invited O
to O
allow O
a O
listening O
sound. O

The O
concept O
seemed O
nice, O
but O
who O
are O
we O
laughing O
at? O

Quantities B-TARGET
are O
microscopic O
and O
stratospheric O
prices! O

Count O
about O
20€ O
for O
a O
coconut B-TARGET
egg I-TARGET
(even O
not O
cooked O
properly), O
a O
dish B-TARGET
comprising O
about O
50g O
of O
chicken O
and O
3 O
green O
beans O
and O
two O
potato O
washers O
and O
a O
fruit O
salad... O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
extremely O
noisy O
place. O

Anyway, O
to O
run, O
unless O
you're O
really O
not O
hungry... O

Kitchen B-TARGET
good O
but O
in O
the O
end O
the O
addition O
is O
salty O

Well-executed O
dishes, B-TARGET
the O
sauces B-TARGET
are O
also O
good O

Parpadelle B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crayfish I-TARGET
and O
clams B-TARGET
very O
good O
but O
slightly O
too O
fat O

The O
calf B-TARGET
was O
tasted O

God's O
Tatin B-TARGET
Pie O

Very O
nice O
welcome B-TARGET
to O
this O
small O
restaurant. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
small O
but O
very O
pleasant O

In O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
it O
is O
correct O
but O
it O
is O
not O
exceptional! O

(I O
am O
a O
fan O
of O
Italian O
cuisine O
and O
I O
regularly O
go O
to O
Italy O
so O
I'm O
pretty O
difficult!) O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
chocolate B-TARGET
fondant I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Properly O
served O
dishes, O
excellent O
turbot B-TARGET
pavement I-TARGET
and O
correct O
prices O
for O
the O
neighborhood. O

And O
to O
wrap O
it O
all O
up, O
a O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
smile O
from O
beginning O
to O
end O
:)! O

I O
always O
come O
back O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
with O
real O
pleasure! O

Restaurant B-TARGET
now O
to O
avoid. O

Bad O
value O
for O
money. O

The O
rib B-TARGET
that O
in O
the O
menu O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
300 O
g O
was O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
school's O
canteen-in-law. O

And O
in O
general O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
ridiculous O
for O
their O
price. O

The O
sautéed B-TARGET
apples I-TARGET
were O
simple O
fries. O

Too O
bad, O
because O
the O
decor B-TARGET
remains O
impressive. O

An O
excellent O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
honey B-TARGET
magret I-TARGET
is O
divine, O
the O
perfect O
soufflé, B-TARGET
the O
very O
pleasant O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
quick O
service, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
great O
decor, B-TARGET
a O
good O
time O
with O
family! O

Not O
within O
the O
reach O
of O
all O
scholarships, O
but O
without O
being O
very O
expensive. O

If O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
correct O
(holy B-TARGET
jacques I-TARGET
- O
risotto O
)...we O
should O
not O
be O
too O
hungry... O
only O
three O
holy O
jacques O
all O
barely O
hot. O

For O
the O
other O
dishes, B-TARGET
no O
green O
vegetables O
are O
offered O
in O
accompaniment O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
be O
content O
with O
fries, O
purée O
of O
potatoes O
risotto O
or O
vegetables O
from O
the O
pot O
to O
the O
fire....The O
non-existent O
service, B-TARGET
to O
the O
question O
that O
there O
is O
in O
the O
gourmet O
coffee O
the O
answer O
was O
dependent O
on... O

A O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
sniffs O
her O
hair O
behind O
the O
bar... O
And O
the O
little O
touch O
that O
goes O
well O
we O
came O
out O
imbued O
with O
a O
smell O
of O
frying... O

In O
short, O
there's O
no O
point O
in O
taking O
a O
detour O
to O
eat O
in O
this O
bistro. B-TARGET

Still O
very O
full O
at O
noon, O
I O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
go O
there O
only O
in O
the O
evening. O

And O
every O
time, O
no O
disappointment: O
varied O
menu, B-TARGET
fresh O
and O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
tasty O
dishes, B-TARGET
copious O
portions B-TARGET
and O
very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

Prices O
are O
also O
correct. O

I'd O
like O
to O
advise O
you. O

It's O
been O
three O
times O
now O
that O
I'm O
going O
to O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
three O
times O
that O
I O
always O
enjoy O
so O
much. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
tasty O
and O
in O
good O
quantities. O

There O
is O
something O
for O
all O
the O
cravings O
(meat, O
fish). O

I O
strongly O
recommend O
the O
mussel B-TARGET
cap I-TARGET
or O
the O
bowl B-TARGET
(if O
it O
comes O
back O
to O
the O
card), O
but O
on O
the O
whole, O
everything O
is O
good. O

The O
cheese B-TARGET
plate, I-TARGET
if O
you O
have O
some O
room O
left, O
is O
generous O
and O
excellent. O

So O
we'll O
understand O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
love: O
go O
there O
with O
friends O
or O
between O
lovers O
you'll O
never O
be O
disappointed! O

We O
came O
to O
dinner O
with O
the O
family O
in O
this O
restaurant O
at O
the O
end O
of O
November O
2014. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time. O

Little O
Hic: O
the O
charcuterie B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
offered O
at O
the O
aperitif O
for O
two O
people O
was O
really O
not O
copious, O
even O
for O
two O
people. O

But O
for O
the O
rest, O
varied O
cuisine, B-TARGET
good O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
we O
will O
come O
back! O

Very O
long O
and O
cold O
service. B-TARGET

Frozen O
and O
poorly O
thawed O
food. B-TARGET

For O
the O
same O
price, O
you O
can O
find O
a O
good O
number O
of O
addresses O
on O
this O
same O
street! O

Dinner O
with O
friends O
and O
terrible O
experience. O

Service B-TARGET
of O
incredible O
slowness. O

A O
unique O
menu B-TARGET
imposed O
for O
the O
table O
of O
ten O
(!!!). O

Terrible O
choice. B-TARGET

Presentation O
of O
the O
mediocre O
dishes. B-TARGET

Terrible O
taste O
- O
especially O
never O
take O
the O
beef B-TARGET
from O
a O
disgusting O
behind O
taste O
in O
a O
saucepan O
of O
potato O
puré O
like O
a O
bitter O
soup. O

Extremely O
expensive: O
185 O
euros O
per O
couple. O

Avoid!!!! O

Unthinkable O
that O
restaurants B-TARGET
like O
this O
exist O
in O
Paris... O

In O
the O
morning, O
it's O
an O
original O
place B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
her O
birthday... O

We O
were O
a O
Friday O
night O
tab, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
execrable, O
cold O
dishes, B-TARGET
not O
friendly, O
restaurant B-TARGET
so O
dark O
that O
you O
don't O
see O
what O
you O
eat O
there O
(I O
understand O
why O
now...) O

The O
server B-TARGET
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
accuse O
its O
customers O
of O
not O
paying O
(while O
it O
is O
his O
job O
to O
calculate O
correctly..) O
the O
manager O
is O
aggressive O
and O
grabs O
his O
customers O
on O
the O
pretext O
that O
they O
did O
not O
pay.... O

In O
short O
15 O
people O
who O
won't O
come O
back.... O

Microwave O
heated O
kitchen, B-TARGET
slow O
service, B-TARGET
but O
especially O
very O
excessive O
prices O
given O
the O
fairly O
medium O
quality. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
avoid. O

Positive: O
smiling O
welcome, B-TARGET
friendly O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
charming O
setting B-TARGET

Negative: O
the O
content O
of O
the O
plate B-TARGET

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
short, O
which O
can O
be O
an O
advantage O
(high O
turnover O
so O
fresh O
products) O
but O
is O
a O
disadvantage O
when O
there O
are O
missing O
products B-TARGET
(the O
truffle O
on O
that O
day), O
so O
limited O
choice. O

We O
had O
the O
wrong O
thing O
to O
fall O
back O
on O
a O
burger B-TARGET
and O
a O
fish B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chips, I-TARGET
fatal O
mistake: O
medium O
burger, O
soft O
and O
fat O
fries, B-TARGET
as O
for O
the O
fish O
and O
chips O
impression O
of O
eating O
only O
frying O
dough O
bathed O
in O
grease. O

Tropezian B-TARGET
pie, I-TARGET
though O
delicious, O
wasn't O
enough O
to O
catch O
up O
with O
this O
missed O
lunch. O

We O
should O
have O
been O
wary O
of O
the O
almost O
empty O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
Friday O
night. O

Under O
the O
pretext O
of O
inventory, O
half O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
entrances B-TARGET
and O
wines B-TARGET
were O
missing. O

We've O
been O
cold O
all O
over O
the O
meal. O

The O
toilets O
are O
filthy O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
casual O
as O
possible. O

What O
a O
disappointment! O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
still O
good O
but O
thin. O

Great O
disappointment, O
mediocre O
welcome. B-TARGET

Request O
for O
change O
of O
place O
because O
we O
were O
near O
the O
door O
but O
we O
remained O
unanswered. O

We O
had O
the O
impression O
of O
disturbing O
because O
he O
said O
to O
his O
colleague O
"Pff O
they O
want O
to O
change O
places". O

Very O
dry O
chicken B-TARGET
and O
cold O
fried B-TARGET
for O
€15.50 O
+ O
very O
dry O
grilled B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
light O
rice B-TARGET
for O
€16.50 O

Also O
the O
quantities O
are O
not O
the O
same O
between O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
à O
la O
carte O
dish. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
and O
last O
time. O

It's O
a O
shame. O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
flee O
absolutely. O

42€ O
for O
two O
glasses B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
- O
barely O
fair O
- O
without O
giving O
us O
the O
card, O
of O
course. O

Antipathetic O
servers B-TARGET
at O
all O
possible. O

Bench O
chairs O
and O
a O
depressing O
interior. B-TARGET

You O
don't O
have O
to O
say O
any O
more, O
this O
bar B-TARGET
is O
awful. O

Old-fashioned O
decoration, B-TARGET
dirty O
and O
greasy O
menus, B-TARGET
non-existent O
service, B-TARGET
a O
hot O
beer B-TARGET
that O
has O
not O
even O
been O
changed, O
overcooked O
meats B-TARGET
(with O
pears!!) O
and O
limited O
damage... O

In O
short O
a O
scandal!!! O
Avoid!!! O

Very O
good O
bistro. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
welcome!!! B-TARGET
We O
ate O
very O
well O
with O
traditional O
dishes B-TARGET
as O
at O
home, O
quality O
but O
also O
quantity O
are O
in O
rdv!!! O

Bistrot B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
especially O
if O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
a O
moment O
in O
Montmartre O
without O
being O
in O
the O
cohue O
of O
tourist O
restaurants!!! O

But O
think O
of O
booking O
because O
there O
are O
not O
many O
places O
and O
the O
bistro B-TARGET
fills O
quickly!!! O

I've O
rarely O
seen O
that. O

The O
calf B-TARGET
was O
so O
old... O
that O
it O
seemed O
like O
bad O
beef O
was O
bleeding... O

The O
ham B-TARGET
was O
squeaky. O

Sticky O
potatoes B-TARGET

The O
cream B-TARGET
frozen O
and O
tasteless O

And O
they O
dare O
to O
call O
it O
Stallope O
Saltimbocca... O

At O
18 O
euros O
90 O
it's O
theft O

The O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
rosé I-TARGET
must O
have O
come O
from O
a O
bottom O
of O
a O
cub O

As O
for O
the O
service B-TARGET
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
talk O
about O
it O

Not O
a O
smile, O
not O
a O
kind O
word. O

We O
have O
to O
make O
them O
eat O
the O
restaurant's O
kitchen... B-TARGET

Avoid O
at O
all O
costs O

In O
the O
neighborhood O
for O
the O
price O
of O
a O
dish O
you O
will O
have O
a O
full O
meal O
with O
a O
smile O

Very O
disappointing O
despite O
a O
very O
good O
location. B-TARGET

Server B-TARGET
not O
at O
all O
nice O
with O
a O
very O
black O
humor O
and O
neither O
thank O
you O
or O
nothing O
on O
leaving. O

The O
service O
is O
far O
too O
fast O
for O
it O
to O
be O
done O
live. O

The O
salmon B-TARGET
wasn't O
very O
fresh O
and O
the O
turkey B-TARGET
wasn't O
cooked O
enough. O

The O
house B-TARGET
desserts I-TARGET
apparently O
are O
correct. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
in O
this O
small O
restaurant O
with O
sober O
and O
elegant O
decor. B-TARGET

The O
20 B-TARGET
Euro I-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
are O
served O
at O
lunchtime O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
include O
entrance O
+ O
dish O
+ O
dessert. O

We O
went O
there O
at O
lunchtime O
between O
colleagues O
and O
it O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
efficient O
and O
the O
traditional B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

You O
can O
also O
take O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at O
34 O
euros O
more O
sophisticated O
or O
choose O
the O
card. O

A O
real O
luxury: O
a O
quiet O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Paris! O

Certainly O
the O
map B-TARGET
is O
not O
great, O
the O
price O
is O
not O
particularly O
cheap, O
but O
when O
it O
is O
beautiful O
and O
you O
want O
to O
have O
lunch O
outside O
by O
hearing O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
appreciable. O

Average B-TARGET
welcome, I-TARGET
we O
feel O
like O
we're O
bothering O
the O
staff. O

We O
settle O
down O
at O
a O
table, O
we're O
finally O
asked O
to O
move O
around. O

We O
choose O
our O
menu, O
the O
carpaccio B-TARGET
comes O
from O
metro, O
it's O
certain O
and O
the O
fries B-TARGET
are O
not O
fresh. O

Not O
to O
mention O
chocolate B-TARGET
moss I-TARGET
that O
has O
nothing O
of O
a O
moss. O

It's O
more O
like O
a O
stuff O
that's O
too O
sweet. O

Water O
carafe O
asked O
twice O
before O
having O
it. O

Small O
plus: O
A O
waiter B-TARGET
offered O
us O
an O
aperitif. O

But O
to O
an O
attitude O
a O
little O
displaced, O
embarrassing O
limit O
of O
a O
rough O
dredger. O

This O
may O
please O
some, O
but O
our O
table O
has O
been O
disturbed. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend, O
there O
are O
smaller O
breweries O
better O
and O
cheaper O
on O
bets. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
located O
in O
a O
pedestrian B-TARGET
street I-TARGET
dedicated O
to O
mass O
tourists O
and O
is O
surrounded O
by O
other O
restaurants O
of O
the O
same O
acabit. O

The O
animation B-TARGET
is O
painful O
and O
noisy O
and O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
kind O
of O
establishment O
we O
were O
looking O
for. O

The O
food B-TARGET
there O
is O
more O
than O
mediocre O
(burned O
fish, B-TARGET
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
mussels I-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
insipid O
desserts) B-TARGET
and O
also O
a O
non-existent O
service B-TARGET
plus O
a O
more O
than O
salty O
addition. O

The O
service B-TARGET
in O
this O
bistro B-TARGET
more O
than O
typical O
Parisian O
is O
pleasantly O
good. O

And O
that's O
it. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
disappointing, O
too O
greasy O
with O
a O
taste O
not O
pleasant. O

Prices O
as O
one O
can O
imagine O
in O
this O
type O
of O
establishment O
not O
too O
high O
but O
still O
too O
high O
for O
the O
quality O
served. O

It O
was O
all O
bad. O

Starting O
with O
the O
warm O
and O
tiny O
snails, B-TARGET
the O
side B-TARGET
is O
full O
of O
tasteless O
veins O
and O
Without O
texture. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
totally O
absent O
and O
incompetent O
and O
the O
blind O
man O
has O
all O
this. O

What O
a O
joke O
and O
to O
finish O
an O
addition O
of O
75€ O
when O
I O
couldn't O
eat O
anything! O

To O
avoid O
like O
plague O

A O
typical O
Parisian O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
delicious! O

Hot O
goat O
entrance, B-TARGET
followed O
by O
a O
honey/lemon O
duck B-TARGET
magret I-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
sautéed O
apples, O
a O
real O
delight! O

Their O
cellar B-TARGET
is O
also O
excellent! O

In O
short, O
an O
address B-TARGET
to O
memorize O
and O
where O
I O
would O
return! O

Choosing O
a O
very O
limited O
buffet. B-TARGET

lukewarm O
food. B-TARGET

Middle O
reception. B-TARGET

Overall O
Medium... O

Almost O
non-existent O
dessert B-TARGET
choice. O

At O
will O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
say. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
the O
staff O
department O
wasn't O
at O
the O
meeting. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
medium O

The O
choice O
is O
limited O
(ideal O
for O
small O
appetites O
) O

No O
pastries O
for O
a O
brunch B-TARGET
not O
top O
even O
if O
the O
concept O
is O
American O
we O
are O
in O
France O
and O
the O
minimum O
would O
have O
been O
a O
crescent O

The O
staff B-TARGET
don't O
monitor O
your O
plates O
and O
we O
have O
to O
insist O
on O
being O
served. O

The O
only O
positive O
point O
is O
hot B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET

Nice O
decor, B-TARGET
good O
music, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
of O
a O
correct O
price/quality O
ratio... O
an O
establishment B-TARGET
that O
would O
be O
most O
pleasant O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
not O
detestable O
and O
anything O
but O
professional O
: O

- O
An O
unkind O
leader B-TARGET
who O
gives O
you O
the O
impression O
of O
disturbing O
after O
barely O
laying O
a O
foot O
in O
the O
establishment O

- O
Pressurized O
waitresses/servers B-TARGET
(including O
at O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
service O
when O
the O
place O
is O
almost O
empty) O
and O
of O
rare O
impoliteness O

- O
Special O
mention O
to O
the O
bartender B-TARGET
who O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
only O
friendly O
person O
in O
the O
place O

In O
short, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
peak O
for O
an O
establishment B-TARGET
highlighting O
its O
New O
York O
influences! O

After O
a O
fourth O
visit O
and O
an O
identical O
observation, O
I O
would O
no O
longer O
set O
foot O
in O
it! O

Let's O
make O
it O
clear, O
this O
is O
our O
favorite O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Paris! O

We O
have O
been O
there O
5 O
or O
6 O
times O
already O
and O
each O
time O
we O
have O
enjoyed O
ourselves O
for O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
given O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
are O
in O
Paris. O

Last O
Thursday O
we O
especially O
enjoyed O
the O
candied B-TARGET
pig's I-TARGET
china I-TARGET
with O
its O
gnocchi B-TARGET
(the O
best O
I've O
had O
to O
taste) O
and O
its O
girolles. O

In O
dessert, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
unmissable O
lemon B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
served I-TARGET
otherwise, I-TARGET
we O
also O
enjoyed O
with O
the O
lost B-TARGET
brioche...Superb! I-TARGET

Starter, O
dish, O
dessert O
at O
30€ O
in O
the O
evening, O
wine O
glass O
at O
8€. O

Anyway, O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
have O
an O
opportunity O
to O
celebrate, O
we O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Last O
point, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
sober O
and O
tasteful! O

everything O
was O
very O
well: O
welcome B-TARGET
- O
decoration B-TARGET
- O
meals! B-TARGET

All O
the O
ingredients O
are O
combined O
to O
have O
a O
very O
good O
evening! O

very O
affordable O
price O
- O
I O
already O
want O
to O
go O
back O
there O
to O
make O
our O
friends O
discover O
our O
favorite!! O

A O
great O
disappointment! O

The O
card B-TARGET
announces O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
dishes O
and O
unfortunately O
we O
have O
had O
some O
dishes, B-TARGET
see O
very O
fair O
at O
prices O
exceeding O
the O
service. O

I O
advise O
you O
not O
to... O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
mediocre, O
the O
food B-TARGET
bad O
and O
the O
note O
is O
very O
high. O

To O
avoid. O

I O
can't O
give O
notes. O

A O
nice O
little O
neighborhood O
bistro, B-TARGET
you O
eat O
well O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

Classic O
bistro O
dishes, B-TARGET
for O
"parisian" O
prices O
(15-20 O
euros). O

Go O
there O
if O
you O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
or O
at O
noon O
where O
the O
formulas B-TARGET
are O
more O
affordable. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
during O
the O
summer O
is O
very O
nice O
and O
spacious O
enough, O
ideal O
for O
a O
drink. O

The O
only O
strong O
point O
is O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

Very O
nice. O

Almost O
non-existent O
service. B-TARGET

But O
where O
are O
they O
going O
to O
get O
their O
waitresses B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
waiters. I-TARGET

No O
professionalism. O

In O
the O
kitchen, O

Frozen O
men O
rule. O

Suspicious O
freshness. O
Industrial O
desserts. B-TARGET

Only O
for O
a O
drink O
on O
the O
terrace O
and O
dinner O
AILLEURS. O

Small O
brewery, O
nice O
and O
busy O
card, B-TARGET
the O
servers B-TARGET
are O
not O
very O
friendly, O
yielding O
above O
all. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
is O
served O
correctly, O
the O
gratin B-TARGET
smells O
garlic O
at O
3 O
meters. O

A O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
served O
almost O
frozen. O

The O
spaguetti B-TARGET
carbonara I-TARGET
which O
bathes O
in O
the O
cream B-TARGET
completely O
liquid, O
the O
reception B-TARGET
not O
very O
pleasant, O
I O
would O
not O
return. O

What O
a O
surprise O
in O
view O
of O
the O
fame O
of O
this O
brewery-restaurant O
where O
certainly O
the O
servers O
have O
kept O
the O
style O
of O
the O
large O
breweries O
but O
the O
service O
is O
a O
little O
direct O
and O
the O
cuisine O
is O
really O
not O
up O
to O
the O
addition O
because O
without O
moving O
far O
away O
there O
are O
other O
tables O
which O
they O
sometimes O
away O
from O
the O
large O
towers O
remain O
reasonable O
but O
respect O
the O
clientele O

both O
by O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
by O
the O
reception; B-TARGET

In O
short, O
if O
you O
can O
avoid O
this O
tourist O
trap O
don't O
hesitate. O

In O
this O
very O
touristic O
area, B-TARGET
this O
small O
unpretentious O
restaurant B-TARGET
offers O
inexpensive O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
even O
a O
very O
accessible O
menu B-TARGET
formula. I-TARGET

Of O
course O
it O
is O
not O
a O
big O
kitchen B-TARGET
but O
the O
value O
for O
money O
is O
quite O
honest. O

An O
excellent O
location B-TARGET
with O
strong O
potential O
but O
everything O
has O
been O
zero. O

Huge O
wait B-TARGET
to O
take O
the O
command O
and O
when O
the O
server B-TARGET
finally O
comes, O
it O
takes O
command O
of O
the O
last O
arrivals. O

Long O
wait B-TARGET
to O
get O
his O
drinks. O

Many O
people O
lost O
patience O
and O
left. O

Unkind O
waiters B-TARGET
at O
all, O
no O
class. O

The O
worst O
part O
was O
when O
you O
paid. O

Because O
of O
the O
slowness O
of O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
coming O
to O
us, O
we O
went O
to O
the O
coffers O
to O
pay. O

One O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
was O
quick O
this O
time O
coming O
to O
us O
because O
he O
seemed O
to O
think O
we O
were O
going O
to O
leave O
without O
paying. O

He O
looked O
at O
us O
a O
little O
unimportant. O

Really O
the O
service B-TARGET
will O
have O
been O
horrible O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end O
and O
those O
for O
most O
of O
the O
customers O
who O
were O
installed O
around O
us. O

Fuyezzz O

They O
gave O
us O
the O
wrong O
dish, O
then O
when O
they O
changed O
it, O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
cold. O

We O
ordered O
a O
chocolate B-TARGET
mellow, I-TARGET
a O
dish O
usually O
difficult O
to O
miss, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
mellow O
and O
it O
had O
no O
taste. O

Service B-TARGET
of O
very O
good O
quality, O
pleasant O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
cuisine! B-TARGET

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
fresh O
and O
seasonal, O
it's O
a O
treat! O

I'll O
go O
back O
to O
the O
other O
dishes O
on O
the O
map. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
unexpectedly O
we O
will O
go O
back O
there O
carelessly! O

Very O
good O
card B-TARGET
with O
simple O
but O
sought O
after O
dishes. O

The O
servers B-TARGET
are O
really O
nice O
and O
welcoming. O

A O
delight O
in O
this O
area O
or O
many O
restaurants O
are O
tourist O
traps. O

I O
highly O
recommend! O

I O
often O
come O
there O
at O
noon, O
excellent O
crepes B-TARGET
and O
very O
great O
choices. O

The O
cakes B-TARGET
are O
tasty O
and O
at O
very O
reasonable O
prices. O

Nice O
service. B-TARGET

nothing O
transcendent; O
ratio O
quality O
price O
barely O
average, O
they're O
all O
like O
that O
in O
the O
street. O

cleanliness O
limit, O
toilet O
to O
avoid. O

Do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
do O
a O
few O
hundred O
additional O
meters. O

Very O
good O
welcome, B-TARGET
full O
brasserie O
card, B-TARGET
good O
value O
for O
money, O
pleasant O
setting. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
and O
efficient O
service, B-TARGET
we O
were O
served O
in O
less O
than O
10min O
on O
Friday O
evening O
at O
8pm. O

Quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
very O
correct, O
my O
butcher's B-TARGET
piece I-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
tender, O
and O
my O
panna B-TARGET
cotta I-TARGET
delicious. O

Of O
course O
it's O
not O
a O
gourmet O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
it's O
not O
what O
we O
ask! O

Simple O
but O
good O
products B-TARGET
(flat O
egg, O
roasted O
tomatoes O
and O
bacon), O
then O
successful O
homemade O
cheesecake. B-TARGET

The O
flat O
was O
waiting B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
servers B-TARGET
but O
a O
little O
out O
of O
date O

Quality O
meal B-TARGET
and O
homemade, O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money, O
right O
next O
to O
the O
eiffel B-TARGET
tower. I-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
welcome. B-TARGET

I O
tend O
to O
have O
apprioris O
about O
meals B-TARGET
in O
breweries O
but O
we O
were O
satisfied. O

Frozen O
kitchen, B-TARGET
of O
poor O
quality. O

Bad O
cooking O
of O
food. B-TARGET

No O
manager O
in O
the O
restaurant O
to O
answer O
our O
requests. O

However O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O

I O
loved O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Small O
and O
warm, O
we O
ate O
great O
well! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
at O
the O
TOP, O
the O
great O
welcome, B-TARGET
our O
excellent O
dish! B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone! O

We O
stopped O
by O
chance O
in O
front O
of O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
does O
not O
pay O
for O
a O
mine O
from O
the O
outside. O

What O
a O
surprise! O

Products, B-TARGET
fresh, O
nicely O
presented O
and O
very O
good. O

The O
set O
showed O
originality O
without O
being O
pretentious, O
for O
a O
very O
correct O
sum. O

The O
rates O
are O
above O
the O
Paris O
average O
in O
view O
of O
the O
equally O
banal O
service. O

The O
significant O
flat O
like O
other O
l O
confirmed O
upstream O
in O
the O
comments: O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
the O
service....PAS B-TARGET
A O
SOURIRE. O

..served O
with O
a O
stone O
spear! O

Not O
a O
thank O
you... O
what O
a O
sadness. O

So O
in O
case O
of O
absolute O
necessity O
only O
for O
survival O
otherwise O
look O
in O
the O
immediate O
vicinity. O

To O
meet O
much O
nicer O
people. O

A O
disaster O
to O
be O
avoided O
absolutely. O

We O
went O
there O
before O
a O
show, O
the O
servers B-TARGET
are O
overflowing O
and O
unpleasant, O
a O
real O
Parisian O
cliché! O

A O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
had O
served O
the O
order O
twice O
at O
a O
nearby O
table O
just O
yelled O
at O
her O
clients. O

As O
for O
us, O
our O
passage O
through O
the O
toilets O
was O
memorable, O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting O
(giant O
room, O
4 O
toilets O
for O
everyone, O
well O
played), O
a O
sick O
smell O
and O
frankly O
a O
cleanliness O
more O
than O
limit. O

Then, O
going O
up O
into O
the O
room, O
an O
angry O
waiter B-TARGET
hears O
us O
say O
"there O
are O
no O
towels O
to O
wipe O
his O
hands O
down" O
makes O
my O
husband O
a O
crook, O
who O
lacks O
to O
spread O
all O
his O
length O
on O
the O
floor. O

A O
useless O
assault O
that O
ruined O
our O
evening. O

Anyway, O
we'll O
never O
go O
back. O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
very O
nice O
setting! B-TARGET

But O
above O
all O
fresh O
products, B-TARGET
finally O
real O
fries B-TARGET
that O
do O
not O
bathe O
in O
oil, O
fresh O
salad B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
dessert!! B-TARGET

To O
be O
recommended. O

Personally, O
I O
took O
the O
tournedos O
for O
16 O
euros. O

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money! O

The O
only O
good O
point O
the O
very O
nice O
frame. B-TARGET

Even O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
winter O
we O
were O
able O
to O
eat O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
thanks O
to O
the O
outdoor O
heating. O

Otherwise O
it O
is O
simple O
all O
that O
is O
not O
to O
prepare O
is O
good, O
the O
rest O
without O
flavor. O

Cocktail B-TARGET
too O
sweet O
vs O
good O
wine. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
charcuterie B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
tray O
vs O
Bruchetas B-TARGET
and O
tasteless O
paste. B-TARGET

But O
especially O
the O
worst O
of O
our O
dishes O
arrived O
before O
the O
entrance, O
so O
we O
reported O
that O
we O
had O
not O
had O
the O
entrance. O

Our O
entrances O
arrived O
then O
our O
dishes O
after O
a O
very O
long O
wait B-TARGET
while O
it O
was O
the O
plates O
arrived O
too O
early O
that O
they O
warmed... O
Cold O
pasta B-TARGET
on O
top O
and O
that O
smoke O
below O
= O
microwave. O

A O
bread B-TARGET
that O
knows O
water O
= O
microwave. O

So O
they O
didn't O
bother O
to O
redo O
our O
plates. O

In O
short, O
the O
prepared B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
not O
good O
and O
they O
make O
fun O
of O
the O
customers. O

Very O
any O
cuisine B-TARGET
in O
a O
yet O
"good O
chic O
good O
genre" O
setting. B-TARGET

The O
wines B-TARGET
are O
very O
expensive. O

The O
scornful O
and O
rude O
hotel B-TARGET
master. I-TARGET

To O
escape O
absolutely! O

We O
went O
there O
last O
night O
and O
we O
were O
more O
than O
disappointed. O

Lamentable O
service, B-TARGET
mediocre O
meats B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
salty O
note! O

To O
avoid O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
urgency! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
treat O
yourself O
from O
mouth O
to O
dessert O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
push O
the O
door O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
table O
upstairs. O

For O
connoisseurs O
in O
dessert, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
take O
the O
thousand B-TARGET
fleuilles I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
fruit. I-TARGET

You O
can't O
lick O
the O
plate O
because O
it's O
not O
done, O
but O
you're O
very O
sorry O
that O
your O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
over. O

Don't O
trust O
the O
empty O
entrance, O
it's O
all O
upstairs. O

Beautiful O
decor, B-TARGET
low O
lighting, B-TARGET
casual O
welcome. B-TARGET

We O
tested O
the O
tasting O
menu O
at O
70€. O

It O
includes O
8 O
surprise O
dishes O
and O
an O
amuse-mouth. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast. O

The O
small O
amounts O
of O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
are O
frustrating, O
because O
the O
flavors O
are O
excellent O
but O
they O
are O
well O
dosed O
to O
get O
to O
dessert. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
seasonal. O

The O
chef O
mastered O
the O
mix O
of O
tastes O
and O
textures. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
originality, O
but O
we O
still O
enjoy O
it. O

A O
good O
French B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
in O
this O
restaurant, O
a O
very O
warm O
place, B-TARGET
a O
good O
service B-TARGET
to O
ask O
for O
more? O

I O
would O
return O
with O
great O
pleasure O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Parisian B-TARGET
brasserie I-TARGET
of O
neighborhood O
no O
more O
or O
less. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
correct O
as O
well O
as O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Nothing O
negative O
to O
say O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
it O
doesn't O
come O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary. O

We O
were O
there O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

Deco's B-TARGET
not O
bad, O
music B-TARGET
for O
the O
30/40's O
pretty O
nice. O

Good O
cocktails B-TARGET
and O
very O
nice O
bartender. B-TARGET

Choice O
of O
very O
classic O
dishes, B-TARGET
and O
quality O
of O
mediocre O
dishes. O

Very O
perfect O
service B-TARGET
(slow, O
and O
poorly O
organized). O

I'm O
not O
going O
back O
except O
for O
a O
drink, O
I O
think. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located, O
close O
to O
the O
Sacred B-TARGET
Heart. I-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
pleasant O
but O
is O
fast! O

The O
capricioza B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
not O
exceptional. O

For O
the O
salad, B-TARGET
my O
friend O
had O
taken O
a O
salad, O
the O
price O
was O
a O
little O
high O
for O
a O
green O
salad O
and O
2 O
slices O
of O
ham O
under O
vacuum. O

Nice O
place! B-TARGET

Entries B-TARGET
to O
share: O
very O
good! O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
dishes: B-TARGET
be O
careful! O

Ridiculous O
wearings! B-TARGET

And O
so O
great O
for O
what O
it O
is! O

And O
taste, O
not O
at O
all O
up O
to O
the O
price! O

Get O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

How O
can O
one O
say O
home O
cooking O
with O
these O
asparagus B-TARGET
in O
box, O
its O
burgundy B-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
filled O
with O
low O
pieces.....these O
snails B-TARGET
decongeles O
etc...French O
cuisine O
really? O

I O
came O
there O
by O
chance O
with O
my O
son O
and O
would O
no O
longer O
set O
foot O
there O
unfortunately O
strangers O
have O
come O
too, O
the O
poor!! O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
mediocre O
and O
prices O
far O
too O
high O
for O
quality. O

To O
banish O
absolutely. O

It O
was O
not O
bad O
but O
despite O
their O
originality O
and O
beautiful O
presentation, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
by O
the O
dishes: B-TARGET
artichokes B-TARGET
in O
a O
can O
(the O
boxes O
are O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
stairs...), O
meat B-TARGET
a O
little O
too O
cooked, O
expensive O
wines. B-TARGET

That O
said, O
the O
waitress's B-TARGET
good O
mood O
and O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
catch O
up O
a O
bit O
with O
this O
mixed O
opinion. O

It's O
been O
a O
few O
times O
since O
we've O
been O
there, O
and O
we're O
never O
disappointed, O
nor O
the O
loved O
ones O
we O
bring. O

Their O
couscous B-TARGET
is O
really O
excellent. O

The O
meatballs B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
the O
lamb B-TARGET
skewers I-TARGET
also. O

Two O
kinds O
of O
vegetable O
mixes O
are O
offered O
as O
an O
accompaniment. O

The B-TARGET
chef's I-TARGET
suggestion I-TARGET
changes O
regularly O
and O
the O
latest O
one, O
couscous B-TARGET
méchoui I-TARGET
is O
particularly O
good. O

In O
order O
not O
to O
spoil O
anything, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
attentive. O

To O
be O
tested O
absolutely O
and O
come O
very O
hungry! O

Tapas B-TARGET
are O
excellent...The O
charcuterie B-TARGET
is O
also O
of O
quality. O

Everything O
made O
us O
want... O
Nothing O
to O
say! O

Pleasant O
service B-TARGET
that O
is O
more. O

Good O
little O
address! B-TARGET

No O
brasserie O
or O
restaurant. O

A O
simple O
neighborhood O
coffee B-TARGET
that O
improvises O
restaurateur. O

Insipid O
salads B-TARGET
and O
warmed O
(mal) O
dishes. B-TARGET

Non-existent O
wine B-TARGET
list. O

Industrial O
desserts. B-TARGET

We O
have O
the O
impression O
that O
everything O
is O
improvised, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
competence O
either O
on O
the O
reception B-TARGET
level, O
on O
the O
service B-TARGET
level, O
or O
on O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
level O
(frozen O
dishes). B-TARGET

Sound O
atmosphere B-TARGET
far O
too O
high O
for O
a O
restaurant. O

Too O
bad O
for O
them, O
we O
don't O
want O
to O
renew O
the O
experience. O

the O
worst O
culinary O
experience O
of O
Paris, O
with O
an O
astronomical O
addition: O
lobster B-TARGET
ravioles I-TARGET
at O
20 O
euros O
(the O
ravioles O
had O
to O
have O
at O
least O
3 O
days) O
then O
back B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cod I-TARGET
not O
cooked O
on O
potatoes, B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
not O
fresh O
arugula B-TARGET
at O
47 O
euros. O

We O
didn't O
have O
dessert. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
horrible. O

To O
proscribe! O

Very O
cold O
welcome, B-TARGET
the O
boss B-TARGET
is O
very O
antipathetic O
and O
aggressive. O

It O
seemed O
to O
disturb O
her O
by O
asking O
for O
mayonnaise O
or O
mustard. O

The O
well-ordered O
rumsteack B-TARGET
pavement I-TARGET
was O
overcooked, O
a O
hair O
was O
found O
in O
a O
hamburger, O
which O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
shock O
them. O

The O
rosé B-TARGET
was O
warm. O

We O
won't O
go O
back O
and O
advertise O
to O
them. O

Obviously O
this O
restaurant O
preferred O
to O
bet O
everything O
on O
the O
frame B-TARGET
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
the O
kitchen! B-TARGET

Burger B-TARGET
hyper O
dry, O
badly O
cooked, O
fries B-TARGET
tasteless O
other O
than O
oil, O
hot O
beer... B-TARGET
rather O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
which O
seemed O
almost O
more O
sorry O
than O
us O
for O
the O
total O
sinking O
of O
this O
evening. O

Definitely O
to O
be O
avoided. O

Ah! O

I O
forgot: O
if O
you O
find O
your O
cheeseburger B-TARGET
at O
14,50€ O
too O
dry, O
you O
are O
informed O
that O
you O
could O
have O
added O
a O
salad O
leaf O
or O
a O
pickle... O
billed O
0.50€! O

It's O
all O
said. O

Curtain. O

A O
gentleman's B-TARGET
croque I-TARGET
without O
fries O
with O
salad B-TARGET
in O
sachet, O
obviously O
without O
flavor... O

I'm O
not O
talking O
to O
you O
about O
the O
price... O

We O
find O
a O
gum O
glued O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
our O
glass O
of O
water, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
doesn't O
apologize O
and O
puts O
the O
blame O
on O
the O
dishwasher... O
we O
don't O
even O
offer O
a O
commercial O
gesture O
we O
have O
to O
ask O
the O
manager O
who O
can O
only O
offer O
us O
a O
coffee O
(but O
we O
don't O
drink O
coffee...). O

Again O
this O
restaurant O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
typical O
Parisian O
tourist O
brewery O
that O
buys O
its O
low O
quality O
products B-TARGET
from O
"metro" O
and O
makes O
you O
pay O
a O
blind! O

Poor O
tourist! O

We O
went O
there O
for O
lunch. O

Fast O
and O
courteous O
welcome. B-TARGET

The O
dishes, B-TARGET
well O
presented, O
colorful O
and O
savoury, O
were O
rich O
and O
tasty. O

Original O
and O
light O
desserts. B-TARGET

We O
have O
not O
taken O
any O
wine, O
so O
I O
have O
no O
opinion O
on O
the O
subject. O

At O
a O
time O
when O
the O
Marais O
is O
changing, O
changing O
faces O
and O
not O
necessarily O
in O
the O
best O
sense O
of O
the O
word, O
a O
real O
discovery O
tonight!! O
I O
confirm O
that O
for O
many O
years O
I O
haven't O
eaten O
as O
well O
in O
this O
neighborhood O
as O
tonight! O

A O
big O
thank O
you O
for O
this O
rich O
cuisine B-TARGET
modern O
and O
full O
of O
flavor, O
thanks O
also O
to O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
to O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
kindness O
and O
professionalism O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
thank O
you O
and O
thank O
you O
again O

Of O
course O
we O
pay O
the O
location B-TARGET
but O
that's O
not O
a O
reason. O

The O
sauerkraut, B-TARGET
the O
flagship O
product, O
is O
acidic O
and O
is O
eaten O
without O
real O
pleasure....it O
is O
a O
shame O
with O
such O
potential O
not O
to O
do O
better. O

Service B-TARGET
correct O
and O
fast O
there O
is O
not O
missing O
much. O

We O
found O
everything O
very O
good O
but O
the O
reception B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
nice O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
horrible. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
did O
not O
smile O
at O
all O
the O
dinner, O
she O
served O
us O
the O
first O
dish O
before O
drinks, O
we O
have O
to O
ask O
for O
cutlery O
and O
bread O
three O
times. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
for O
the O
quantity B-TARGET
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
so O
horrible O
that O
we O
found O
it O
expensive. O

It's O
the O
perfect O
place B-TARGET
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
forgotten O
and O
ignored! O

We O
don't O
recommend O
it O
at O
all!!!! O

In O
this O
quiet O
area, B-TARGET
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
have O
dinner O
outside O
under O
the O
arcades O
while O
enjoying O
a O
very O
good O
seasonal O
cuisine. B-TARGET

A O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
good O
advice O
for O
the O
choice O
of O
wines. O

In O
addition, O
a O
good O
value O
for O
money O
for O
this O
Parisian O
restaurant. B-TARGET

To O
be O
recommended. O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
a O
welcome, B-TARGET
a O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
lunch B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
at O
an O
unbeatable O
price, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
should O
be O
mentioned O
in O
the O
various O
guides. O

Excellent O
dinner, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
waitress, B-TARGET
and O
sifted O
atmosphere.. B-TARGET
We O
tested O
several O
entries O
and O
dishes.. O
No O
one O
was O
disappointed. O

Counselor! O

A O
warm O
address, B-TARGET
with O
a O
cosy O
and O
pleasant O
setting. B-TARGET

Excellent O
tapas, B-TARGET
tasted O
with O
delicious O
cocktails, B-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
least O
original! O

Nice O
place, B-TARGET
that's O
what's O
sold. O

But O
in O
terms O
of O
service B-TARGET
and O
organization, O
it O
is O
improvisation O
at O
all O
times. O

Waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
is O
too O
long O
and O
there O
is O
a O
clear O
lack O
of O
organization. O

Apart O
from O
its O
location B-TARGET
and O
its O
setting, B-TARGET
really O
nothing O
exceptional O
for O
this O
"cantine"! O

Flavorless O
dishes B-TARGET
have O
exorbitant O
prices! O

We O
always O
think O
that O
we O
have O
the O
price O
posters O
on O
the O
map, B-TARGET
we O
should O
at O
least O
eat O
well. O

Well O
NO, O
pass O
your O
way O
and O
don't O
go O
in O
the O
pomponette, B-TARGET
it's O
the O
scam! O

Deception O
at O
the O
time O
of O
tasting O
the O
thick O
and O
shocking O
tab, B-TARGET
my O
husband's O
calf B-TARGET
liver I-TARGET
had O
the O
same O
appearance O
as O
my O
dish, O
even O
brown B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shallots...français I-TARGET
nothing O
exceptional! O

The O
nice O
service B-TARGET
without O
more O
and O
the O
price O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
quantity, O
good O
desserts, B-TARGET
but O
we O
will O
not O
go O
back! O

This O
address B-TARGET
has O
been O
very O
good O
for O
several O
years. O

But O
that O
was O
before. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
less O
complete, O
some O
particularly O
tasty O
and O
original O
dishes O
have O
disappeared. O

Service B-TARGET
has O
deteriorated. O

No O
more O
smiles, O
icy O
welcome. B-TARGET

And O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
getting O
worse, O
all O
this O
is O
getting O
less O
and O
less O
digested. O

That's O
too O
bad. O

There's O
no O
artifice O
here. O

Fresh O
products, B-TARGET
well O
seasoned O
and O
prepared O
with O
respect O
for O
French O
cuisine. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
attentive, O
patient, O
courteous O
and O
discreet... O

Bravo. O

The O
terrines B-TARGET
and O
meat B-TARGET
are O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
the O
wines B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Beaujolais. I-TARGET

A O
simple O
but O
tasty O
cuisine B-TARGET
with O
good O
products. B-TARGET

The O
stew B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shallots I-TARGET
with O
its O
mushrooms O
stoves O
is O
a O
delight. O

It's O
always O
a O
treat O
to O
go. O

Very O
high O
prices O
for O
dishes B-TARGET
at O
the O
limit O
of O
the O
eatable. O

I O
ate O
a O
very O
dry, O
over-cooked O
chicken B-TARGET
for O
25 O
euros! O

A O
shame O

At O
any O
time O
one O
can O
eat O
properly O
and O
if O
one O
sticks O
to O
the O
menus B-TARGET
it O
is O
correct O
and O
at O
acceptable O
rate O
given O
the O
institutional O
character O
of O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

A O
la O
carte B-TARGET
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
but O
the O
choice O
is O
wider. O

Greeting O
welcome, B-TARGET
fast O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
classified O
setting, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
good O
memory O
of O
Paris O

Really O
delicious. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
in O
an O
original O
setting B-TARGET
in O
which O
you O
feel O
good. O

A O
nice O
card B-TARGET
full O
of O
good O
surprises. O

This O
property B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
perfect, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
and O
competent. O

The O
excellent O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
truffles B-TARGET
are O
served O
at O
very O
soft O
prices. O

In O
short, O
it O
is O
certainly O
one O
of O
the O
best O
Parisian O
bistros. O

Everything O
was O
perfect: O
the O
welcome, B-TARGET
the O
setting, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(a O
pianist O
plays O
classical O
songs O
between O
two O
"song O
numbers"), O
the O
very O
fine O
meal, B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
songs! B-TARGET

Having O
talented O
artists O
singing O
opera O
right O
next O
to O
us O
is O
magical! O

An O
excellent O
evening O
that O
is O
well O
worth O
the O
price. O

I O
came O
to O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant O
with O
colleagues. O

I O
found O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
pretty, O
medium. O

My O
entry B-TARGET
to O
the O
lawyer O
was O
quite O
ordinary. O

The O
dish O
of O
the O
Saint B-TARGET
Jacques I-TARGET
shells I-TARGET
with O
pasta O
was O
correct. O

The O
dessert O
a O
fine B-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
was O
very O
medium. O

The O
pie B-TARGET
was O
cold O
and O
not O
particularly O
cool. O

The O
accompanying O
ice B-TARGET
was O
correct O
but O
only O
a O
small O
ball. O

We O
were O
almost O
the O
only O
guests O
during O
the O
evening. O

My O
colleagues O
were O
on O
average O
satisfied. O

My O
neighbor O
warmed O
his O
kidneys B-TARGET
that O
were O
cold. O

So O
do O
not O
select O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
gourmet O
meal B-TARGET
but O
to O
eat O
properly O
without O
more. O

We O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
tasted O
several O
dishes B-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
without O
refinement. O

I O
don't O
see O
where O
he O
can O
keep O
his O
reputation. O

So O
if O
you O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
time O
and O
eat O
good O
things O
A O
VITE. O

If O
you O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
to O
be O
seen O
this O
is O
the O
perfect O
place. B-TARGET

Apart O
from O
the O
lamentable O
cuisine, B-TARGET
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

The O
master O
word, O
authenticity. O

Here, O
French B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
is O
in O
the O
spotlight. O

A O
table B-TARGET
of O
character O
where O
you O
go O
when O
you O
appreciate O
the O
good O
things. O

Just O
taste, O
we O
love O
it. O

The O
friendly O
mind O
as O
you O
like. O

a O
little O
noisy, O
however, O
given O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
tables. O

A O
real O
treat O
make O
it O
last. O

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money O
for O
this O
very O
nice O
little O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Impeccable O
service, B-TARGET
the O
boss B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
always O
smile! O

We O
have O
tested O
many O
different O
and O
always O
excellent O
dishes! B-TARGET

Value O
for O
money O
very O
honest O
for O
this O
great O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Excellent. O

From O
entry O
to O
dessert O
to O
a O
very O
nice O
choice O
of O
wine B-TARGET
list. I-TARGET

All O
this O
for O
about O
thirty O
euros, O
and O
less O
than O
50€ O
with O
drink, O
it's O
remarkable! O

Bravo. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
classic O
decor B-TARGET
will O
delight O
you. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
impeccable, O
both O
diligent O
and O
discreet. O

I O
love O
those O
restaurants O
where O
we O
always O
have O
wine O
in O
our O
cup O
without O
ever O
having O
to O
touch O
the O
bottle, O
for O
me O
this O
testifies O
that O
the O
staff B-TARGET
always O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
you O
to O
serve O
you. O

Synchronization B-TARGET
(time O
to O
serve O
different O
dishes) O
was O
quite O
correct. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
tasty. O

A O
little O
more O
vegetables O
in O
the O
servings O
would O
be O
appreciated O
for O
our O
taste. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
was O
adequate, O
but O
the O
wine B-TARGET
is O
served O
a O
tantinet O
too O
hot. O

A O
perfect O
lunch! B-TARGET

The O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
are O
irreproachable: O
friendly, O
not O
at O
all O
guinded; O
young, O
generous! O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
like O
on O
the O
plate O
with O
a O
lunch B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
doesn't O
have O
its O
equal! O

Everything O
is O
refined, O
fragrant, O
aesthetic, O
surprising! O

A O
great O
happiness! O

Lots O
of O
kindness, O
lots O
of O
flavors! O

What O
else? O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excellent O
from O
starter O
to O
dessert. O

It O
makes O
up O
for O
the O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
waiting B-TARGET
to O
get O
a O
seat. O

Indeed, O
in O
the O
evening O
there O
is O
no O
possible O
reservation, O
so O
it O
is O
on O
a O
waiting O
list O
which, O
it O
seems O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
week O
can O
be O
very O
long. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
cordial O
service. B-TARGET

Restaurant B-TARGET
packed. O

That's O
a O
good O
sign. O

We O
confirm O
good O
Parisian O
table. O

Apéro B-TARGET
house O
advised. O

Just O
a O
little O
disappointed O
about O
seasoning. B-TARGET

Foie B-TARGET
gras I-TARGET
lacked O
some O
cooking. O

Hare B-TARGET
not O
bad O
but O
too O
crushed. O

The O
perfect O
wine. B-TARGET

Kind O
service. B-TARGET

Charming O
brasserie O
atmosphere B-TARGET
with O
a O
very O
friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
typically O
French O
and O
seasonal O
but O
prepared O
in O
a O
way O
a O
little O
too O
"industrial": O
For O
example, O
the O
7-hour O
cup B-TARGET
served O
in O
a O
casserole O
is O
boiled!!! O
Value O
for O
money O
a O
little O
exaggerated. O

Let's O
make O
it O
simple: O

The O
plus: O

- O
The O
sourcing O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
is O
top O

- O
it's O
good, O
it's O
controlled O
and O
it's O
original. O

- O
Formulate B-TARGET
the O
12 O
noon O
TOP O

The O
least: O

- O
unpleasant O
boss, B-TARGET
bum O
and O
haughty O

- O
It's O
often O
expensive. O

- O
"organic" O
"natural" O
wines B-TARGET
often O
expensive O
and O
disgusting O

Conclusion: O

If O
you're O
in O
the O
area, O
but O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
rush, O
very O
good O
bistros O
are O
not O
what's O
missing O
in O
Paris. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
correct O
but O
not O
exceptional, O
slow O
service. B-TARGET

Don't O
accept O
the O
restaurant O
tickets O
or O
the O
American O
Express O
card... O
and O
let O
you O
know O
without O
care. O

Too O
bad O
because O
the O
frame B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
for O
dinner O
with O
friends. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
good, O
for O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
it's O
something O
else... O

A O
chorizo B-TARGET
dorad, I-TARGET
without O
chorizo. O

Instead, O
a O
kind O
of O
candied B-TARGET
lemon I-TARGET
tomatoes. I-TARGET

And O
when O
you O
ask O
the O
boss O
to O
come O
and O
taste O
and O
it's O
actually O
not O
good O
and O
she's O
going O
to O
ask O
in O
the O
kitchen O
the O
problem. O

Well, O
too O
much O
lemon O
juice O
but O
no O
commercial O
gesture. O

The O
so-called O
house O
purée B-TARGET
is O
muslin, O
and O
I'm O
not O
talking O
about O
the O
other O
vegetables B-TARGET
that O
are O
boiled O
and O
tasteless. O

I O
also O
find O
it O
regrettable O
that O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
have O
arrived O
cold... O

Tomato O
carpaccio B-TARGET
in O
the O
entrance O
was O
good. O

The O
dessert, O
a O
soup B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
basil I-TARGET
was O
correct. O

In O
short, O
for O
two O
people O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
rosé: O
86€ O
for O
cold O
dishes, B-TARGET
without O
flavors, O
which O
do O
not O
correspond O
to O
what O
is O
written O
on O
the O
map. O

To O
this O
is O
added O
the O
bad O
faith O
of O
the O
boss... B-TARGET

Despite O
a O
nice O
terrace, B-TARGET
I O
will O
never O
set O
foot O
in O
my O
life O
again O
in O
this O
restaurant... B-TARGET

A O
friendly O
team, B-TARGET
real O
traditional B-TARGET
French I-TARGET
food, I-TARGET
freshness O
of O
food, B-TARGET
inventiveness O
(pig B-TARGET
feet I-TARGET
to O
test O
:)) O
in O
recipes, O
good O
little O
wines, B-TARGET
frankly, O
it's O
been O
4 O
times O
that O
I O
go, O
and O
I'm O
always O
delighted! O

Just O
a O
few O
steps O
from O
the O
pantheon, O
we O
think O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
touristic, O
but O
not: O
a O
rather O
intimate, O
retro O
decor, B-TARGET
with O
large O
mirrors, O
the O
map O
on O
an O
old-fashioned O
slate, O
the O
beautiful O
wooden O
tables... O

A O
very O
good O
address! B-TARGET

I O
advise O
you O
the O
formula B-TARGET
at O
16,50 O
€. O

We O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
highlight O
of O
this O
warm O
bistro B-TARGET
is O
its O
cuisine. B-TARGET

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
served O
in O
sufficient O
quantity O
and O
well O
hot. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
smiling O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
pleasant. O

The O
26 O
Euro O
menu B-TARGET
for O
entry/plate/dessert O
offers O
a O
very O
satisfactory O
price/quality O
ratio. O

The O
negative O
points O
are O
the O
lack O
of O
space O
(the O
tables O
are O
small O
and O
very O
close), O
the O
rather O
noisy O
environment B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
time O
before O
being O
served O
(about O
45 O
minutes O
before O
having O
the O
entrance). O

Despite O
this, O
I O
will O
return O
with O
pleasure O
and O
invite O
you O
to O
discover O
this O
place. B-TARGET

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
lunch O
in O
early O
December. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
but O
the O
prices O
are O
exaggerated O
even O
for O
the O
neighborhood. O

The O
boss B-TARGET
is O
non-existent O
or O
even O
casual O
and O
unpleasant O
with O
the O
customers. O

Very O
long O
waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
and O
bad O
service B-TARGET
which O
spoils O
a O
bit O
the O
evening. O

Too O
many O
tables O
for O
the O
surface, O
the O
customers O
are O
piled O
up. O

Correct O
food. B-TARGET

The O
meal B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
with O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
finally O
"homemade". O

Very O
nice O
and O
smiling O
waitress. B-TARGET

Very O
complete O
and O
drippy O
menu B-TARGET
at O
25€, O
unbeatable O
price/quality O
ratio O
in O
the O
neighborhood. O

If O
we're O
looking O
for O
the O
little O
beast, O
maybe O
we O
can O
wait B-TARGET
a O
little O
while. O

We'll O
be O
back. O

My O
best O
restaurant B-TARGET
address! O

On O
my O
plate: O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
a O
delight. O

Fine, O
fragrant, O
with O
coconut O
milk O
in O
parsimony, O
savourily O
spicy. O

Welcome B-TARGET
to O
the O
top! O

The O
alliance O
of O
Asian O
heat O
and O
all O
the O
delicacy O
of O
service B-TARGET
to O
the O
West. O

The O
wait B-TARGET
is O
no O
longer O
long O
than O
elsewhere. O

We O
feel O
guided O
in O
our O
choice O
of O
dishes. O

My O
wallet: O
quite O
reasonable. O

We O
paid O
€56 O
for O
3 O
starters, O
2 O
dishes O
and O
accompaniments O
and O
2 O
desserts. O

It's O
been O
years O
since O
I O
made O
my O
qg O
there O
and O
the O
guests O
I O
brought O
made O
them O
theirs. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
of O
poor O
quality, O
dishes B-TARGET
certainly O
heated O
several O
times, O
hygiene O
to O
be O
desired... O

Servers B-TARGET
are O
difficult O
to O
understand O
and O
especially O
unkind! O

Finally, O
it O
cannot O
be O
said O
that O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
pleasant. O

In O
short, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
to O
be O
avoided. O

Nice O
neighborhood O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
nice O
Parisian O
setting B-TARGET
with O
all O
these O
posters O
on O
the O
walls. O

We're O
a O
little O
tight, O
but O
your O
neighbors O
are O
always O
nice O
and O
some O
have O
what O
they O
call O
a O
"head." O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
honourable O
and O
there O
is O
a O
good O
price/quality O
ratio. O

Nothing O
gastronomic O
of O
course O
but O
local O
cuisine.We B-TARGET
come O
here O
to O
have O
a O
good O
time O
between O
friends O
without O
ruining O
ourselves O
and O
we O
come O
back O
with O
pleasure. O

Well, O
I O
have O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service! B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
nice O
and O
everything O
was O
very O
well O
organized, O
there O
was O
no O
pressure O
at O
all O
on O
the O
contrary O
they O
were O
all O
very O
cool O
despite O
the O
ton O
of O
dishes O
they O
had O
to O
serve! O

The O
current O
went O
very O
well O
with O
us O
and O
yet O
we O
were O
a O
great O
taboo O
of O
12 O
very O
active O
people! O

Some O
have O
seen O
their O
lamb B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
not O
well O
cooked O
so O
2 O
bottles O
of O
red O
were O
offered O
to O
us O
as O
compensation. O

I O
took O
a O
fillet B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
morel I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
it O
was O
quite O
delicious O
and O
cooked O
the O
right O
way, O
perfect. O

Home-made O
fries B-TARGET
are O
also O
a O
treat. O

Also O
I O
advise O
you O
to O
taste O
the O
mojito, B-TARGET
a O
large O
drink O
for O
5€, O
super O
good. O

We O
came O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
full, O
even O
on O
the O
terrace, O
so O
a O
tip: O
book O
in O
advance! O

For O
most O
of O
us, O
we O
found O
our O
seine O
dock O
headquarters! O

A O
welcoming O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
chef B-TARGET
and O
his B-TARGET
collaborators I-TARGET
are O
very O
nice O
and O
smiling. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
relaxed O
and O
cosy O
at O
the O
same O
time... O

If O
I O
had O
lived O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
good O
chances O
of O
me O
making O
it O
my O
evening O
canteen. O

A O
bistro O
cuisine B-TARGET
but O
very O
careful, O
some O
traditional B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
exquisitely O
revisited. O

The O
pot B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
beef O
cheeks O
is O
to O
fall O
to O
the O
ground! O

Delicious O
at O
the O
palace, O
they O
are O
also O
very O
pleasant O
to O
the O
view. O

Bravo! O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
dirty, O
the O
industrial O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
poor O
quality, O
the O
unkind O
staff, B-TARGET
nothing O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
acceptable. O

To O
flee. O

We O
went, O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
friends, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
warm, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
very O
nice. O

The O
couscous B-TARGET
and O
tajines B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
accompanied O
by O
a O
good O
Moroccan B-TARGET
red I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
of O
the O
sympathies O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
and O
mint O
tea, B-TARGET
a O
very O
pleasant O
evening. O

A O
correct O
price O
quality O
ratio. O

We O
went O
there O
on O
May O
14 O
as O
a O
couple O
with O
our O
son. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
good O
but O
nothing O
extraordinary, O
booty, O
guinea O
fowl... O

A O
children's B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
with O
only O
one O
choice O
of O
dish O
and O
not O
possible O
to O
have O
anything O
else, O
we O
had O
to O
order O
the O
guinea O
fowl B-TARGET
much O
too O
copious O
for O
an O
8-year-old O
child O
who O
was O
counted O
as O
an O
adult O
dish O
at O
25 O
euros! O

A O
very O
expensive O
poultry! B-TARGET

In O
short O
140 O
euros O
to O
3 O
with O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine O
and O
a O
lemonade, O
it O
is O
too O
much O
for O
a O
very O
simple O
lunch. B-TARGET

Average O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
who, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
is O
not O
the O
job. O

The O
Breton O
boss B-TARGET
is O
nice! O

Very O
friendly, O
it O
is O
more O
than O
a O
restaurant, O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
family. O

meal B-TARGET
and O
an O
irreproachable O
wine, B-TARGET
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

Despite O
the O
good O
will O
of O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
we O
feel O
the O
place B-TARGET
rather O
badly O
organized. O

Indeed, O
between O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
arrive O
late O
and O
those O
that O
are O
not O
cooked O
as O
requested, O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
annoying. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
good O
and O
of O
good O
quality O
however O
and O
the O
place, B-TARGET
even O
though O
a O
little O
dark O
to O
my O
taste, O
is O
not O
unpleasant. O

To O
be O
improved O
so O
that O
it O
becomes O
a O
real O
good O
address! B-TARGET

We O
attended O
a O
lot O
of O
this O
little O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
there O
it O
dropped O
a O
lot... O

We O
go O
back O
with O
a O
wolf O
hunger O
because O
the O
plates B-TARGET
are O
tiny, O
and O
the O
addition..., O
very O
salty... O

The O
dishes O
are O
not O
bad, O
but O
there O
is O
so O
much O
better O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
as O
Thai O
restaurant! O

To O
avoid O
if O
you O
care O
about O
your O
purse...! O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
indeed O
and O
that O
is O
all O
I O
can O
write O
positive. O

A O
non-existent O
and O
totally O
disorderly O
service; B-TARGET
a O
boss B-TARGET
who O
spends O
more O
time O
talking O
with O
his O
friends O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
restaurant O
room O
rather O
than O
doing O
his O
job. O

An O
atmosphere B-TARGET
that O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
bobo O
/ O
Parisian O
but O
then O
rather O
on O
the O
decline O
seen O
the O
panel O
(age) O
of O
the O
room. O

As O
for O
the O
food, B-TARGET
it's O
horrible. O

To O
be O
avoided O
absolutely. O

An O
excellent O
meal B-TARGET
mixing O
American O
flavor O
and O
know O
how O
to O
make O
French O
from O
the O
entrance O
to O
dessert. O

We O
were O
5 O
and O
tasted O
2 O
entries, B-TARGET
5 O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
4 O
desserts, B-TARGET
all O
excellent O
and O
very O
well O
prepared, O
especially O
the O
entrances. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
warm O
and O
original O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
without O
false O
notes O
and O
friendly O
is O
more O
rapid.The O
selection O
of O
wines B-TARGET
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
map O
and O
the O
price O
with O
your O
;). O

To O
recommend, O
excellent O
dishes, B-TARGET
impeccable O
quality, O
interesting O
price/quality O
ratio. O

Our O
choice, O
duck O
magret, B-TARGET
delicious, O
cassoulet, B-TARGET
excellent O
and O
lamb B-TARGET
ribs I-TARGET
to O
lick O
the O
babins. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
not O
left O
out, O
charlotte O
with O
choco, O
bread O
lost O
and O
gourmet O
coffee. O

Very O
nice O
staff B-TARGET
and O
good O
advice. O

We O
will O
return!! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
the O
warm O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
service B-TARGET
"to O
the O
right O
franquette". O

A O
correct O
price-quality O
ratio O
for O
the O
neighborhood. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
had O
nothing O
quite O
exceptional: O
vegetables B-TARGET
not O
enough O
cooked, O
a O
lamb B-TARGET
mouse I-TARGET
served O
in O
large O
portions, O
without O
any O
finesse. O

Good O
choice O
of O
wines. B-TARGET

The O
romantic O
ballad O
after O
the O
meal O
is O
necessary. O

Two O
seven O
o'clock, O
an O
aperitif O
that O
turns O
into O
dinner. O

Small O
summer O
salad, B-TARGET
simple O
fresh O
and O
cheap. O

Tiramisu B-TARGET
has I-TARGET
efficient O
strawberry O
at O
the O
end O
of O
dinner. O

Nice O
service, B-TARGET
the O
very O
young O
team. O

One O
of O
the O
servers B-TARGET
has O
the O
physics O
of O
a O
15-year-old O
;) O
but O
very O
dynamic O
and O
friendly. O

I O
often O
came O
there O
a O
few O
years O
ago, O
summer O
on O
large O
terrace B-TARGET
tables O
to O
share O
great O
moments O
with O
my O
family. O

Too O
bad O
I O
couldn't O
find O
that O
spirit O
tonight. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
probably O
very O
famous O
but O
then O
a O
long O
time O
ago... O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
has O
remained O
as O
before O
and O
it O
has O
its O
charm. O

But O
in O
the O
plate O
no O
kitchen, B-TARGET
industrial O
warm-up O
as O
at O
the O
business O
restaurant! O

A O
friendly O
waiter, B-TARGET
but O
that's O
the O
only O
positive O
point. O

Why O
don't O
you O
go O
to O
a O
brewery? O
You'll O
be O
less O
disappointed. O

Very O
fair, O
prices O
that O
cool, O
a O
reception B-TARGET
more O
than O
average. O

And O
as O
a O
bonus O
when O
a O
server B-TARGET
walks O
on O
your O
business O
and O
breaks O
something, O
no O
excuse, O
we O
bring O
you O
the O
note O
very O
quickly... O

And O
when O
you O
ask O
for O
at O
least O
an O
apology, O
you O
don't O
care O
about O
our O
heads O
and O
you're O
"kindly" O
begged O
not O
to O
come O
back O
(to O
make O
it O
short). O

I'm O
sure O
I O
won't O
be O
back O
there O
any O
more!! O

It's O
a O
shame! O

Even O
if O
we O
look O
well O
we O
still O
don't O
find O
any O
positive O
points O
at O
this O
meal! O

Very O
slow O
and O
disorderly O
service, B-TARGET
frozen O
and O
bad O
cuisine, B-TARGET
common O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
a O
child O
can O
prepare O
and O
that O
do O
not O
make O
appetite... O

No O
excuse O
for O
service B-TARGET
and O
waiting. B-TARGET

0 O
on O
the O
whole O
line. O

Never O
again O
this O
tourist O
catcher O

I O
wouldn't O
advise O
this O
institution. B-TARGET

I O
took O
a O
tartar B-TARGET
cut O
with O
a O
knife O
but O
the O
beef B-TARGET
was O
of O
very O
poor O
quality, O
the O
fibrous O
and O
hard O
meat B-TARGET
and O
the O
dish B-TARGET
therefore O
had O
no O
flavor. O

I O
love O
tartar, B-TARGET
I O
haven't O
even O
eaten O
the O
3/4. O

It O
wasn't O
fresh O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
bad. O

A O
friend O
recommended O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
he O
was O
right. O

Very O
warm O
welcome, O
impeccable O
service, B-TARGET
the O
handlers B-TARGET
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
just O
beautiful, O
one O
can O
even O
leave O
with O
small O
pots O
or O
ingredients O
used O
by O
the O
restaurant O
that O
are O
sold O
at O
the O
exit. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
really O
friendly, O
it's O
a O
little O
paradise O
when O
you're O
on O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

I O
strongly O
advise O
him. O

I O
didn't O
consult O
the O
reviews O
for O
bad O
luck O
until O
I O
decided O
to O
have O
our O
dinner O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
what O
a O
mistake! O

This O
obliges O
me O
to O
be O
very O
unpleasant O
for O
this O
opinion O
despite O
my O
conciliatory O
nature. O

We O
choose O
the O
menu O
at O
39€ O

The O
appetizer O
included O
is O
not O
served O
to O
us O
and O
the O
entrances O
are O
rushed O
so O
far O
nothing O
too O
serious... O
foie B-TARGET
gras I-TARGET
and O
salmon B-TARGET
corrects O
then O
an O
hour O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
to O
have O
the O
dishes: O
a O
tartar O
and O
a O
paved O
with O
pepper O
the O
meat B-TARGET
had O
to O
be O
of O
correct O
quality O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
selection O
Hugo O
Desnoyer O
(wrong O
idea O
to O
let O
mistreat O
its O
products O
so) O
but O
if O
the O
tartare B-TARGET
is O
eatable O
though O
little O
seasoned O
the O
paved B-TARGET
it O
is O
cooked O
in O
a O
dry O
and O
coaly O
but O
actually O
bleeding O
way O
at O
heart, O
an O
exploit O
and O
the O
oil O
used O
for O
the O
fries B-TARGET
did O
not O
have O
to O
be O
filtered O
so O
they O
are O
rather O
good O
but O
gray... O

Again O
30 O
to O
40 O
minutes O
waiting B-TARGET
for O
desserts B-TARGET
that O
are O
not O

Let's O
quickly O
pass O
on O
the O
water O
carafe O
arrived O
at O
mid O
meal O
and O
the O
wine O
never O
tightened O
up O
the O

way O
not O
adapted O
rave O
and O
to O
finish O
not O
a O
gesture O
on O
the O
addition O
to O
make O
us O
more O
lenient? O

The O
friendly O
setting B-TARGET
and O
a O
little O
professionalism O
could O
straighten O
the O
bar O
but O
at O
the O
moment O
price O
quality O
ratio O
really O
execrable O

Go O
your O
way! O

From O
worse O
to O
worse... O
this O
creperie B-TARGET
we've O
been O
with O
for O
almost O
10 O
years O
has O
gained O
in O
decoration B-TARGET
as O
much O
as O
it O
has O
lost O
in O
taste O
and O
quality O
on O
the O
plates... B-TARGET

Pancakes B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cakes I-TARGET
that O
arrive O
2min30 O
after O
placing O
the O
order...very O
dry...no O
flavors O
and O
especially O
an O
evening O
of O
stomach O
cramps O
for O
the O
4 O
people O
who O
were O
around O
the O
table, O
barely O
20min O
after O
dinner!!! O

We O
regret O
the O
good O
crepery B-TARGET
of O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
will O
finally O
not O
go O
back! O

Despite O
a O
sunny O
and O
green O
terrace B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
to O
the O
beautiful O
days... O

Village O
restaurant. O

Good O
reception B-TARGET
but O
a O
little O
long O
service. B-TARGET

We O
only O
tasted O
pizzas B-TARGET
that O
were O
any. O

Very O
reasonable O
rates. O

Ultra O
slow O
service, B-TARGET
waitresses B-TARGET
without O
smile O
or O
minimal O
friendliness, O
need O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
card, O
egg B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
without O
flavor O
and O
sad O
presentation. O

Great O
effort O
to O
make O
on O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

What O
a O
horrible O
memory! O

We O
were O
attracted O
like O
other O
people O
by O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
and O
low O
prices. O

But O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
were O
installed O
it O
was O
a O
disaster. O

We O
asked O
for O
Coca-Cola O
and O
we O
were O
served O
the O
discount O
soda B-TARGET
without O
having O
informed O
us, O
which O
is O
more O
it O
was O
hot. O

When O
we O
noticed, O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
seemed O
not O
to O
understand. O

We O
ordered O
a O
menu. O

The O
entrance B-TARGET
was O
very O
thin, O
especially O
salad. O

Then O
the O
waitress O
and O
her O
husband O
cooking O
him O
began O
to O
speak O
next O
to O
our O
table O
of O
their O
son O
who O
was O
sick O
and O
who O
did O
not O
come O
to O
the O
bathroom O
(they O
did O
of O
course O
utter O
rude O
words O
in O
front O
of O
us). O

It O
was O
so O
disgusting O
that O
we O
left O
before O
we O
even O
waited O
for O
the O
main O
course. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
laughed O
when O
we O
explained O
to O
her O
not O
to O
appreciate O
their O
conversation, O
so O
we O
understood O
the O
seriousness O
of O
the O
establishment.... O

I O
totally O
advise O
you O
against O
this O
mediocre O
restaurant B-TARGET
or O
unfortunately O
many O
foreign O
tourists O
get O
trapped. O

The O
toilet O
was O
dirty. O

I O
noticed O
a O
small O
sign O
indicating O
that O
their O
duck B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
came O
from O
the O
countries O
of O
the O
East, O
a O
peak O
for O
the O
country O
of O
cassoulet. O

This O
sign O
was O
well O
hidden O
inside O
the O
establishment O
so O
that O
the O
guests O
on O
the O
terrace O
could O
not O
see O
it. O

I O
don't O

this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
had O
come O
at O
noon O
with O
my O
friend O
who O
had O
a O
very O
good O
memory O
of O
this O
restaurant O
and O
therefore O
insisted O
on O
the O
"topissim". O

We O
greeted O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
table, O
which O
for O
restaurateurs B-TARGET
is O
the O
peak, O
we O
seemed O
to O
disturb O
them, O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
that, O
the O
customers O
swollen O
them, O
clearly! O

no O
politeness O
and O
installation O
at O
a O
dirty O
table O
that O
remained O
so O
even O
when O
we O
took O
place. O

During O
the O
meal, O
we O
saw O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
disgusted O
from O
his O
work O
(or O
perhaps O
from O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
to O
his O
work); O
the O
" O
patroness", B-TARGET
in O
any O
case, O
who O
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
higher O
position, O
was O
the O
one O
that O
was O
the O
most O
unpleasant. O

Food, B-TARGET
intolerable! O

dishes B-TARGET
without O
passion, O
broken O
dishes, O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
(crust O
rice O
wholesale) O
very O
dry, O
without O
sauce, O
not O
fresh O
gambas, B-TARGET
a O
poor O
superfluous O
decoration... B-TARGET
in O
short O
no O
taste. O

If O
still O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
could O
have O
caught O
up O
with O
the O
staff!! B-TARGET

Next O
time, O
there O
won't O
be O
any O
here O
anyway! O

We O
came O
running O
May O
2013 O
(I O
put O
Feb O
2014 O
but O
we O
can't O
go O
back O
before O
) O
and O
I O
only O
post O
today, O
but O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
is O
not O
one, O
made O
me O
so O
hallucinating, O
(because O
yes O
people O
open O
a O
restaurant O
with O
absolutely O
nothing O
in O
the O
business O
) O
that O
I O
promised O
to O
raise O
it!! O
and O
I O
promise O
myself O
the O
next O
time O
to O
leave O
the O
restaurant O
from O
the O
beginning! O

It O
should O
be O
forbidden O
to O
pay O
for O
it! O

It's O
an O
insult O
to O
art, O
which O
is O
cooking. O

Could O
the O
explanation O
for O
this O
disaster O
come O
from O
a O
little O
unscrupulent O
owner? O

because O
in O
the O
meantime O
I O
see O
positive O
opinions, O
which O
leaves O
me O
dubitative.. O

At O
the O
boat O
festival, O
we O
came O
by O
chance O
to O
this O
plot. O

We O
were O
led O
by O
the O
front O
of O
this O
unpretentious O
little O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
did O
very O
well. O

The O
meal B-TARGET
was O
typical O
of O
the O
region O
(honey O
goat O
salad, O
seitoise O
seiche O
and O
its O
excellent O
riceotto....). B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
nicely O
presented O
and O
pleasantly O
good. O

We O
will O
return O
with O
great O
pleasure. O

After O
going O
there O
twice, O
I'm O
really O
not O
convinced. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
not O
tip-top, O
neither O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
not O
great. O

Indeed O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
too O
cooked, O
badly O
seasoned, O
a O
pity O
for O
an O
Italian O
restaurant. O

Too O
bad, O
even O
if O
the O
bread B-TARGET
is O
exquisite. O

Disappointed. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
really O
bland, O
tasteless. O

For O
someone O
who O
knows O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
cuisine O
see O
spicy O
in O
general, O
it O
goes O
by O
but O
for O
others O
you O
will O
be O
disappointed. O

It's O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

I O
went O
there O
twice O
to O
be O
sure, O
but O
each O
time O
the O
disappointment O
(a O
variety O
of O
entrance B-TARGET
plates I-TARGET
heated O
in O
the O
microwave, O
elastic O
naan B-TARGET
bread O
and O
meat B-TARGET
(I O
had O
once O
taken O
beef, O
once O
lamb) O
filled O
with O
small O
pieces O
of O
fat. O

No, O
frankly, O
it's O
not O
a O
good O
Indian B-TARGET
restaurant. I-TARGET

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
simply O
excellent O
in O
particular O
the O
specialty O
of O
the O
restaurant, O
linguini B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crayfish. I-TARGET

The O
boss B-TARGET
has O
a O
lot O
of O
humor O
and O
enjoys O
animating O
the O
room. O

A O
pearl. O

Everyone O
knew O
that O
except O
us! O

I O
have O
to O
tell O
you O
to O
avoid O
the O
massacre.... O

Yet O
when O
at O
20hoo O
in O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
it's O
empty O
it's O
that O
it's O
ugly... O
but O
we O
had O
a O
good O
tour O
and O
the O
restaurants O
in O
Metz O
were O
full.... O

Frankly, O
Mac O
do O
would O
have O
arranged O
for O
me. O
I'm O
sorry O
to O
say O
I'm O
never O
going, O
but O
I O
should O
have O
thought O
about O
it.... O

Fat O
and O
frozen O
entry B-TARGET
"nem B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
leeks", I-TARGET
bitter O
burgundy, B-TARGET
and O
tab B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
polenta I-TARGET
to O
gerber... O
(rubber O
meat) B-TARGET
in O
short O
we O
left O
in O
4th O
speed O
plates O
not O
cleared O
story O
to O
change O
air O
as O
quickly O
so O
not O
to O
make O
a O
scene O
on O
Friday O
evening O
after O
a O
crazy O
week...30 O
euros O
per O
person. O

What O
a O
waste. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
nice, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
or O
leader O
is O
not O
professional. O

Humor O
dubious, O
not O
at O
all O
in O
its O
place O
in O
what O
is O
a O
good O
restaurant. O

The O
goal O
is O
clearly O
to O
make O
the O
terrace O
more O
profitable. O

So O
you O
eat O
and O
above O
all O
you O
don't O
linger O
and O
we O
make O
you O
understand O
it. O

No O
explanation O
for O
the O
dishes. O

Unhappy O
limit. O

I'm O
not O
going O
back. O

The O
frame B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
classy O
but O
a O
little O
expensive O
for O
quality. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
time O
that O
we O
are O
going O
between O
noon O
and O
two O
and O
a O
little O
disappointed O
with O
the O
first O
time. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
impeccable, O
pleasant O
personal. B-TARGET

Some O
dishes B-TARGET
on O
the O
whole O
correct O
but O
a O
duck B-TARGET
too O
dry, O
a O
tiramitsu B-TARGET
too O
espresso O
and O
a O
whipped O
whiff B-TARGET
too O
chocolatey! O

The O
mellow B-TARGET
speculos/chocolat I-TARGET
was O
tom O
and O
not O
ground. O

A O
little O
salty O
addition O
for O
the O
tasteful O
pleasure!!! O

Gastronomic O
quasi, O
dishes B-TARGET
of O
qualities O
with O
full O
of O
flavors O
a O
delight, O
regularly O
going O
to O
lunch O
for O
my O
lunch O
break O
I O
am O
rarely O
disappointed O
and O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
at O
the O
top, O
I O
recommend!! O

Hearty, O
generous O
and O
rather O
good O
meals. B-TARGET

Gentle O
but O
overworked O
boss B-TARGET
(success O
requires) O
hence O
some O
expectation O
that O
remains O
bearable. O

I O
don't O
think O
you'll O
find O
the O
best O
burgers O
in O
town, O
but O
they're O
all O
right. O

Located O
not O
far O
from O
my O
office, O
I O
go O
there O
quite O
regularly, O
during O
another O
passage O
I O
had O
been O
disappointed O
and O
I O
didn't O
want O
to O
stay O
on O
a O
bad O
impression O
because O
in O
restoration O
it O
can O
have O
days O
without, O
I O
decide O
to O
go O
there O
with O
several O
colleagues O
but O
this O
time O
the O
impression O
is O
confirmed... O

Served O
point O
meat B-TARGET
blue, O
repetitive O
and O
interestless O
input B-TARGET
buffet, I-TARGET
service B-TARGET
without O
smile, O
first O
arrive O
first O
forget. O

15 O
minutes O
after O
finishing O
the O
main O
course O
we O
are O
still O
not O
cleared. O

No O
dessert, O
no O
coffee, O
thank O
you O
and O
goodbye. O

A O
warm O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
lots O
of O
wine O
bottles. O

Very O
hearty O
and O
cheap O
meals!! B-TARGET

With O
a O
little O
story O
about O
the O
wine O
bottle O
chosen O
excellently O
tell O
by O
the O
very O
pleasant O
boss. B-TARGET

A O
place B-TARGET
has O
obviously O
recommended O
for O
the O
downtown O
toulouse. O

Opinion O
+++++ O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
with O
friends. O

We O
found O
the O
expensive O
prices O
for O
a O
popular O
neighborhood O
restaurant; B-TARGET
Only O
frozen O
in O
addition. O

And O
no O
rab, O
if O
you're O
still O
hungry... O

I O
don't O
recommend O
it. O

The O
boss B-TARGET
only O
cares O
about O
the O
regulars O
(office O
companies), O
the O
others O
pass O
after... O

Entrance, B-TARGET
dish, B-TARGET
dessert B-TARGET
we O
loved! O

A O
very O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
great O
view B-TARGET
of O
St O
Stephen's O
Cathedral, O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
welcoming! O

To O
recommend! O

Do O
it O
before O
closing O
because O
it's O
a O
mythical O
place B-TARGET
in O
Lille. O

A O
little O
disappointed O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
(a O
lot O
of O
false O
steps O
that O
we O
should O
not O
see O
in O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant: O
we O
even O
managed O
to O
get O
our O
coats O
and O
get O
out O
of O
the O
restaurant), O
amazed O
by O
the O
setting, B-TARGET
and O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
but O
I O
stayed O
on O
my O
hunger O
as O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
plates! B-TARGET

Too O
bad, O
but O
I O
could O
say, O
"I O
was O
there!". O

We O
went O
there O
for O
lunch, O
we O
didn't O
have O
much O
time O
to O
eat O
(like O
most O
customers O
elsewhere). O

Our O
order: O
steak O
tartare, O
chef's O
salad O
and O
san O
shovelgrino... O
cold O
dishes O
normally O
quick O
to O
make. O

... O

All O
the O
surrounding O
tables, O
arrived O
after O
us, O
had O
their O
order O
quickly O
and O
strangely O
for O
us O
it O
drags. O

.... O
so O
my O
friend O
will O
take O
some O
news O
of O
our O
dishes O
saying O
that O
we O
are O
in O
a O
hurry O
"I'll O
see O
where O
it O
is" O
then O
radio O
silence. O

15 O
minutes O
later O
I O
go O
back: O
"The O
next O
dishes O
will O
be O
yours O
don't O
worry" O

4 O
dishes O
later O
still O
no O
trace O
of O
our O
plates. O

.. O

After O
40 O
minutes O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
we O
decide O
to O
leave, O
well O
enraged. O

I O
explain O
why O
to O
a O
waitress O
who O
was O
cashing O
and O
there O
icing O
on O
the O
cake: O
she O
charges O
us O
the O
bottle O
of O
water O
without O
an O
excuse!! O

A O
waitress O
will O
catch O
us O
at O
the O
exit O
to O
apologize O
and O
tell O
us O
that O
our O
dishes O
are O
coming: O
"too O
late O
I'm O
going O
back O
to O
work O
in O
15 O
minutes!" O

Too O
bad O
because O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
looked O
very O
good O
unlike O
the O
triangle O
sandwiches O
of O
the O
supermarket O
that O
we O
had O
to O
eat O
fast O
in O
the O
street!! O

I O
can O
understand O
that O
we've O
been O
forgotten, O
mistakes O
happen, O
but O
there O
are O
ways O
to O
get O
the O
pill O
through. O

We're O
not O
going O
to O
set O
foot O
in O
it O
anymore! O

We O
are O
not O
here O
in O
a O
tourist O
restaurant, O
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
simple O
and O
sober, O
even O
a O
little O
too O
much O
to O
my O
taste, O
I O
who O
like O
the O
cozy O
interiors O
and O
the O
chichis O
ptits, O
the O
wine O
list O
on O
a O
sheet O
A5 O
folded O
in O
half O
throws O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
at O
first. O

But O
we're O
not O
here O
for O
that O
either, O
but O
to O
eat O
kidneys B-TARGET
that O
seem O
to O
have O
made O
here O
the O
reputation O
of O
this O
old O
lil' O
restaurant. O

The O
famous O
dishes O
arrive, O
neither O
too O
soon O
nor O
without O
waiting. O

Really O
not O
bad O
at O
all O
these O
little O
kidneys, B-TARGET
we O
understand O
their O
success, O
even O
if O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
little O
more O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
garnish. B-TARGET

Dessert: O
Chtiterolles O
and O
gourmet O
coffee. O

My O
spouse O
really O
enjoyed O
his O
good O
and O
consistent O
dessert. B-TARGET

For O
my O
part, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
speculos B-TARGET
cream. I-TARGET

I O
will O
certainly O
go O
back O
there O
to O
eat O
a O
dish O
that O
comes O
out O
of O
what O
can O
be O
done O
in O
the O
old O
lilla O
to O
catch O
the O
tourist, O
even O
if O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
a O
few O
euros O
less O
on O
the O
bill. O

Finally, O
contrary O
to O
what O
I O
was O
able O
to O
read O
here, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
particularly O
clean O
during O
my O
visit. O

Address O
tested O
during O
a O
team O
meal O
(so O
large O
tablée). O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
clean O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
correct, O
albeit O
a O
little O
long O
(but O
perhaps O
there O
was O
a O
shortage O
of O
staff O
that O
day). O

I O
enjoyed O
having O
different O
cutlery O
for O
the O
entrance O
and O
the O
dish O
(because O
how O
many O
restaurants O
now O
leave O
you O
the O
same O
cutlery!), O

as O
well O
as O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
plates. B-TARGET

My O
choice O
had O
been O
about O
country O
terrine, O
Flemish O
carbonnade, O
and O
a O
brioche O
lost O
with O
a O
caramel O
ice O
ball. O

The O
starter B-TARGET
and O
the O
dish B-TARGET
were O
quite O
classic O
(with O
a O
flat O
for O
salad B-TARGET
without O
taste) O
but O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
good. O

My O
colleagues, O
too, O
were O
satisfied O
with O
their O
plates B-TARGET
on O
the O
whole. O

Address B-TARGET
to O
test O
without O
hesitation. O

We O
took O
the O
foie B-TARGET
gras I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
ceps I-TARGET
pasta, I-TARGET
which O
bathed O
in O
balsamic O
cream O
and O
cream! O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
oil! O

We O
also O
took O
the O
risotto B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
St O
Jacques O
which O
was O
very O
rich O
in O
cream! O

And O
the O
St B-TARGET
James I-TARGET
were O
rubbery! O

We've O
gone O
out O
of O
here, O
you O
scumbags! O

Very O
disappointing. O

If O
the O
score O
is O
low O
(61.90) O
for O
a O
meal B-TARGET
and O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
month. O

No O
need O
to O
make O
the O
trip O
to O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
everything O
is O
mediocre. O

We O
had O
never O
had O
the O
gag O
of O
marinated B-TARGET
salmon, I-TARGET
half O
of O
which O
was O
in O
salad. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
not O
home-made, O
which O
feels O
about O
the O
taste. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
average. O

The O
absence O
of O
raw O
customers O
was O
a O
good O
clue, O
trapped! O

I O
was O
looking O
with O
my O
friend O
for O
a O
place B-TARGET
or O
having O
a O
good O
time O
while O
eating O
well, O
it O
was O
the O
perfect O
place! O
and O
we O
also O
drank O
well, O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
a O
name O
like O
that, O
it O
seems O
normal... O

The O
boss B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice: O
we O
recommend O
without O
hesitation. O

And O
I'll O
go O
back O
with O
my O
lover! O

We O
went O
to O
this O
little O
restaurant O
for O
lunch. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
but O
the O
space B-TARGET
is O
restricted O
if O
you O
want O
to O
have O
lunch O
on O
site. O

The O
advantage O
is O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
take O
some O
dishes O
to O
take O
away. O

I O
took O
a O
"gallette" B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
(galette O
+ O
pancake O
+ O
cider O
bowl O
at O
9€40). O

It's O
a O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

The O
cakes B-TARGET
are O
copious O
and O
the O
pancakes B-TARGET
are O
excellent, O
thin O
and O
light. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
and O
a O
cake B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
are O
also O
offered. O

A O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
when O
you O
know O
how O
many O
restaurants O
there O
are O
on O
the O
street. O

To O
know O
that O
there O
are O
a O
majority O
of O
restaurants O
for O
tourists. O

This O
one O
has O
a O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

I O
can't O
believe O
it's O
all O
fresh? O

Anyway, O
it's O
good O
and O
well O
cooked. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

Very O
well O
for O
a O
little O
date O
with O
friends O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

I O
recommend O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
stopped O
by O
chance O
and O
went O
back O
conquered. O

The O
map B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
extensive O
but O
it O
is O
normal O
since O
everything O
is O
fresh O
and O
cooked O
on O
site. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
foam I-TARGET
as O
dessert O
was O
excellent. O

Only O
flat, O
the O
price O
of O
glass B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
that O
is O
too O
expensive. O

Very O
well O
located O
on O
the O
port B-TARGET
facing O
the O
aquarium. B-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
lounge O
decor B-TARGET
rather O
cozy. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
what O
was O
on O
my O
plate: B-TARGET
danger! O

I O
raised O
the O
lid O
of O
my O
burger O
to O
check O
and O
fell O
on O
all O
wilted O
salad B-TARGET
leaves I-TARGET
so O
as O
not O
to O
say O
worse O
than O
that. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
were O
almost O
transformed O
into O
puree O
because O
they O
were O
soaked O
in O
fat. O

Beurk. O

If O
you O
have O
fragile O
health O
pass O
your O
way. O

We O
wanted O
fried O
mussels O
and O
we O
were O
a O
little O
disappointed: O
too O
cooked O
mussels B-TARGET
(or O
even O
re-cooked O
mussels), O
dry O
and O
fads. O

Okay, O
it's O
not O
the O
season, O
we O
won't O
do O
it O
again. O

The O
fries B-TARGET
and O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
were O
mediocre. O

A O
correct O
card B-TARGET
but O
more O
to O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
day, O
without O
too O
much O
evolution. O

Very O
pleasant O
setting B-TARGET
mainly O
in O
ext O
despite O
a O
lack O
of O
gardener..... O

The O
luncheon O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
affordable, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excellent. O

Good O
service. B-TARGET

Exceptional O
setting; B-TARGET
the O
room O
is O
in O
an O
old O
renovated O
abbey. O

I O
haven't O
been O
in O
this O
establishment O
for O
two O
months O
because O
of O
letting O
go O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
that O
is O
no O
longer O
up O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
chain. O

What O
is O
regularly O
missed O
are O
the O
meat B-TARGET
cookings: O
cold O
blue O
barely O
thawed O
in O
the O
center, O
the O
bleeding O
just O
blue, O
etc... O
the O
chips B-TARGET
offered O
at O
the O
entrance O
were O
infected: O
oily O
as O
sponges O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
burn. O

In O
short, O
if O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
does O
not O
re-enter, O
it O
will O
lose O
its O
regular O
clientele O
(the O
people O
passing O
through O
will O
be O
trapped O
but O
it O
harms O
the O
entire O
chain). O

We O
found O
these O
negligences O
three O
times O
before O
making O
the O
decision O
not O
to O
set O
foot O
again. O

Limoges' O
is O
incomparably O
better. O

In O
addition, O
we O
waited O
a O
very O
long O
time O
for O
a O
carafe O
of O
water O
and O
the O
sauce O
supposed O
to O
accompany O
the O
meat O
during O
our O
last O
trial. O

In O
short, O
very O
disappointed O
with O
what O
it O
was O
in O
the O
past. O

only O
the O
wine B-TARGET
was O
correct O
in O
relation O
to O
Q/P, O
the O
entries B-TARGET
and O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
uneven. O

Very O
disappointed, O
little O
friendliness, O
I O
think O
that O
hygiene O
is O
not O
on O
the O
appointment O
(serveuse O
detached O
hair O
and O
fat) O
the O
surprised O
cook O
stinging O
in O
the O
dishes O
with O
his O
fingers, O
very O
dirty O
dishes, O
meat O
cooked O
in O
advance, O
food B-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
bread O
sold O
from O
the O
entrance O
and O
on O
self-service O
in O
the O
room. O

Go O
your O
way O
it's O
better O
not O
to O
recommend. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
at O
the O
same O
time O
refined O
and O
generous O
that O
works O
with O
quality O
products. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice! O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
become O
our O
favorite O
on O
Poitiers, O
so O
we O
highly O
recommend O
it!!! O

Really O
delighted O
very O
nice O
restaurant, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
with O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
listens O
and O
very O
good O
advice, O
level O
meal B-TARGET
really O
very O
good O
nothing O
to O
say. O

I O
recommend O
this O
little O
restaurant O
to O
everyone. O

I O
think O
I'll O
go O
back O
very O
quickly O
as O
a O
couple O
this O
time O
because O
the O
setting B-TARGET
and O
beautiful, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
very O
warm O

We O
were O
very O
well O
received, O
by O
a O
pretty O
waitress, B-TARGET
but O
the O
rest O
was O
a O
horrible O
experience. O

40 O
minutes O
show O
in O
hand O
for O
a O
damaged O
salad B-TARGET
and O
warm O
legs B-TARGET
that O
had O
to O
have O
at O
least O
3 O
days. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
dry O
and O
ransacked. O

Poor O
value O
for O
money. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
charming, O
well O
arranged O
and O
friendly! O

The O
friendly O
pattern B-TARGET
and O
the O
wines B-TARGET
served O
with O
glass O
or O
bottle O
are O
good..a O
lot O
of O
originality O
in O
the O
tapas B-TARGET
proposed, O
moreover, O
very O
good... O

A O
little O
expensive, O
however. O

The O
delivery B-TARGET
of O
brunch O
at O
home O
is O
really O
an O
idea O
of O
genius! O

If O
you O
add O
fresh O
products, B-TARGET
tastes O
and O
original O
recipes, B-TARGET
it's O
paradise! O

The O
prices O
are O
also O
very O
reasonable O
(20 O
euros O
for O
the O
highest O
formula, O
including O
delivery) O
and O
the O
quantities, B-TARGET
more O
than O
copious. O

Homemade B-TARGET
jams I-TARGET
are O
a O
delight, O
I O
advise O
you O
plum B-TARGET
- I-TARGET
fennel, I-TARGET
atypical O
but O
divine O
association! O

This O
place B-TARGET
would O
deserve O
to O
be O
opened O
more O
often O
and O
have O
more O
space O
and O
staff. O

Because O
bagels B-TARGET
change O
the O
usual O
snacks, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

But O
this O
nice O
boss B-TARGET
is O
quickly O
overburdened. O

These O
bagels B-TARGET
are O
good, O
few O
choices O
but O
qualities, O
and O
she O
always O
has O
the O
smile O
and O
the O
nice O
word. O

If O
they O
improve O
some O
points O
it O
can O
quickly O
be O
vicissive O
of O
its O
success O
go O
there O
for O
a O
ride O
if O
you O
are O
curious. O

nice O
address B-TARGET
to O
eat O
on O
the O
inch O
at O
noon O
away O
from O
the O
fat O
and O
the O
usual O
snacks O
that O
we O
get O
tired O
of. O

Great O
ambiance, B-TARGET
tip O
top O
with O
friends. O

After O
midnight O
the O
regulars O
smoke O
their O
cigarettes O
in O
hiding O
at O
the O
bar. O

We O
even O
saw O
a O
waitress O
smoke O
in O
the O
kitchen! O

Rebbitory O
for O
our O
group O
of O
friends! O

Location B-TARGET
to O
avoid O
in O
the O
evening O
if O
you O
are O
with O
family O
because O
apparently O
there O
are O
sometimes O
themed O
evenings O
and O
so O
the O
organizers O
(not O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
place) O
made O
us O
understand O
that O
we O
need O
to O
leave. O

Excellent O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
great O
deco. B-TARGET

Change O
with O
a O
new O
card. O

Burgers, B-TARGET
succulent O
pizzas, B-TARGET
brushettas, B-TARGET
and O
an O
exceptional O
Milanese B-TARGET
escalope. I-TARGET

You're O
going O
to O
enjoy O
yourself. O

Pizzas B-TARGET
are O
honestly O
very O
good! O

The O
chef O
doesn't O
shoot O
at O
the O
merchandise: O
a O
well-stocked O
pizza! B-TARGET

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
smiling O
and O
available. O

Only O
flat: O
the O
chef O
speaks O
(screams) O
a O
little O
loud O
about O
waitresses O
at O
the O
least O
little O
trick, O
a O
little O
too O
strict O
to O
my O
taste O
(I O
wouldn't O
want O
to O
be O
in O
their O
place). O

I O
will O
still O
go O
back O
very O
willingly; O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
:) O

I O
went O
there O
with O
regulars O
who O
had O
told O
me O
good O
and O
that O
she O
was O
not O
our O
disappointment: O

- O
much O
too O
long O
service B-TARGET
knowing O
that O
we O
arrived O
among O
the O
first O
(19:45) O
that O
we O
were O
placed O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
terrace O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
and O
that O
we O
are O
distributed O
at O
10:15 O
pm O
while O
people O
arrived O
after O
us O
are O
spread O
out O
long O
before... O

- O
unprecautionous O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
dropped O
the O
cutlery O
on O
my O
companion O
while O
trying O
it O
without O
an O
apology, O
for O
a O
table O
of O
4 O
he O
carried O
us O
the O
water O
carafe O
one O
by O
one O
(capacity O
75 O
cl) O
while O
we O
had O
suggested O
to O
him O
to O
wear O
2 O
each O
time O
so O
that O
it O
would O
arrange O
everyone O
but O
not O
hear O
what O
made O
us O
wait O
times O
more O
than O
a O
1/4h O
to O
quench O
with O
water O
at O
room O
temperature O
(30°) O
- O
The O
ice O
cubes O
were O
worn O
in O
an O
ice O
cup O
without O
a O
spoon O
nice B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
hygiene! I-TARGET

- O
food: O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
good, O
for O
parsillade B-TARGET
supions I-TARGET
pass O
your O
way O
because O
there O
is O
much O
better. O

Indeed, O
the O
supions B-TARGET
are O
served O
barely O
fried O
with O
whole O
garlic O
heads O
just O
like O
the O
potatoes B-TARGET
sautéed I-TARGET
from O
the O
never O
seen O
and O
especially O
no O
taste! O

Moreover O
the O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
too O
salty O
so O
need O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
(cf. O
2nd O
paragraph) O
- O
Desserts: O
frosted B-TARGET
lemons I-TARGET
nothing O
to O
say O
because O
it O
is O
the O
usual O
industrial, O
the O
tiramisu B-TARGET
is O
served O
with O
chantilly O
and O
English O
cream??? O

Ever O
seen O
and O
especially O
without O
interest O
for O
my O
favorite O
dessert B-TARGET
that O
is O
enough O
without O
artifice... O

- O
the O
limoncello B-TARGET
: O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
menu O
at O
30€, O
served O
at O
room O
temperature O
as O
well O
as O
water O
while O
it O
serves O
ice... O

In O
conclusion O
for O
everyone O
very O
disappointing O
and O
the O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
not O
at O
all O
at O
all O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
or O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
served O
because O
when O
you O
want O
to O
put O
your O
foot O
in O
the O
decorum O
you O
must O
not O
let O
the O
rest O
be O
neglected O
something O
that O
the O
boss O
seems O
to O
have O
lost O
sight O
of O
while O
his O
father O
had O
understood O
it O
well! O

I O
had O
booked O
four O
days O
in O
advance O
a O
table O
for O
9 O
people O
with O
a O
sea O
view O
for O
a O
birthday. O

Result O
there O
was O
no O
more O
table O
available O
on O
the O
terrace O
sea O
view, O
installed O
inside, O
table O
not O
installed O
either! O

Wok B-TARGET
thai I-TARGET
mediocre, O
2 O
goat/salmon B-TARGET
salads, I-TARGET
one O
correct O
but O
the O
other O
missing O
bush O
and O
brick O
leaf!!! O

We O
demand O
rinces O
fingers O
for O
seafood, O
they O
arrive O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
dessert O
with O
excuse O
"we O
had O
more, O
we O
went O
to O
get O
some O
elsewhere" O
amazing O
when O
we O
offer O
seafood O
trays. O

To O
finish O
the O
strawberry B-TARGET
tree I-TARGET
(rather O
a O
foam O
decorated O
with O
some O
strawberries) O
ordered O
for O
the O
birthday O
arrived O
us O
on O
the O
table O
like O
a O
hair O
on O
the O
soup! O

Once O
cut O
out O
we O
found O
ourselves O
with O
a O
cluster O
of O
cream O
in O
the O
plates!!! O

Luckily O
I O
had O
planned O
the O
candles O
because O
no O
special O
attention O
from O
the O
servers B-TARGET
to O
know O
if O
everything O
was O
okay, O
if O
the O
cake O
fit O
us, O
finally O
a O
minimum O
of O
attention O
would O
have O
been O
appreciated O
for O
an O
addition O
of O
270 O
euros!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

Corresponds O
by O
all O
points O
to O
the O
tourist B-TARGET
trap I-TARGET
par O
excellence. O

Guests O
are O
attracted O
with O
a O
photo O
panel O
of O
visiting O
personalities O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

Attractive O
map B-TARGET
of O
local O
specialities, O
continuous O
service O
and O
exorbitant O
prices. O

We O
are O
accepted O
at O
3:00 O
p.m. O
for O
lunch O
at O
8, O
but O
the O
waiter O
is O
alone O
at O
this O
time O
and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
still O
full. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
therefore O
extremely O
long O
and O
very O
disorganized. O

When O
to O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
very O
disappointing. O

We O
were O
brought O
the O
lobster O
pliers O
when O
we O
got O
rid O
of O
the O
table!!! O
The O
coffees O
arrived O
long O
before O
the O
desserts... O

In O
short, O
a O
very O
salty O
addition O
for O
a O
very O
long O
meal B-TARGET
and O
eaten O
without O
pleasure! O

First O
of O
all O
a O
server B-TARGET
literally O
jumped O
on O
us O
when O
we O
read O
the O
card, O
despite O
this O
rather O
brutal O
method O
the O
content O
of O
the O
card B-TARGET
looked O
pretty O
good, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
accept, O
then O
after O
making O
our O
choice, O
the O
wait B-TARGET
was O
long, O
fortunately O
the O
error O
of O
a O
waitress O
with O
her O
plates O
made O
us O
spend O
the O
time, O
they O
made O
us O
feel O
sorry. O

However, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
correct, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
plates O
were O
installed, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
took O
my O
half O
of O
Leffe, O
which O
was O
not O
finished O
without O
me O
seeing O
it, O
it O
was O
a O
rather O
dubious O
practice O
to O
push O
for O
consumption, O
I O
suppose O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
take O
another O
one, O
since O
moreover O
he O
did O
not O
lay O
on O
the O
table O
any O
water O
or O
bread, O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
him, O
and O
he O
replied O
to O
wait O
because O
he O
had O
no O
more O
bread, O
it O
meant O
that O
he O
was O
waiting O
for O
a O
table O
to O
be O
released O
to O
give O
us O
his O
basket? O

And O
finally, O
I O
go O
to O
the O
cash O
register O
to O
pay, O
and O
there, O
the O
cherry O
on O
the O
cake O
he O
announces O
to O
me O
that O
they O
do O
not O
take O
the O
card, O
in O
2015, O
with O
such O
a O
geographical O
location, O
and O
all O
these O
tourists, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
hear O
this, O
it O
smells O
like O
a O
scam, O
right? O

So O
I O
had O
to O
withdraw O
with O
a O
waiter O
that O
followed O
me O
in O
case O
I O
decided O
not O
to O
come O
back, O
besides O
it O
feels O
like O
thieves, O
and O
when O
I O
came O
back O
a O
gentleman B-TARGET
was O
present O
at O
the O
cash O
register, O
he O
wasn't O
smiling O
and O
was O
also O
very O
unpleasant. O

Too O
bad O
because O
the O
frame B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
I O
advise O
no O
one O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
in O
addition O
was O
expensive O
enough O
for O
what O
we O
had, O
and O
on O
the O
note O
no O
SIRET O
number, O
nor O
the O
name O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
chose O
this O
restaurant O
a O
little O
bit O
by O
chance: O
parked O
just O
a O
few O
steps O
away, O
we O
were O
attracted O
to O
a O
map B-TARGET
highlighting O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
home O
made. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
on O
the O
square O
is O
nice O
(low O
traffic). O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
considerate. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
refined: O
the O
market B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
with O
its O
3 O
surprises O
is O
delicious. O

The O
bouillabaisse, B-TARGET
copious, O
was O
a O
treat O
(no O
more O
ridge!). O

The O
only O
small O
flat: O
the O
main B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
of O
the O
menu O
was O
served O
to O
me O
almost O
cold, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
the O
time O
of O
preparation O
of O
the O
bouillabaisse. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
recommend... O

Restaurant B-TARGET
that O
I O
already O
enjoyed O
on O
business O
dinner. O

Private O
outing O
with O
my O
wife, O
and O
really O
not O
disappointed: O
very O
nice O
welcome, B-TARGET
good O
table, O
attentive B-TARGET
server I-TARGET
and O
no O
waiting O
for O
the O
order. O

a O
treat O
on O
fish B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
plancha: I-TARGET
super O
fresh O
fish, B-TARGET
and O
very O
well O
prepared. O

A O
little O
wait B-TARGET
for O
desserts, O
but O
normal O
given O
the O
influx O
(reputation O
and O
quality O
oblige). O

Of O
surcroit, O
ratio O
of O
quality O
taken O
very O
correct O
(45€ O
per O
person O
with O
an O
excellent O
wine B-TARGET
). O

We O
will O
come O
back O
to O
taste O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
map... O
and O
for O
the O
beautiful O
sunset O
on O
the O
bay O
of O
Marseille O
and O
the O
islands. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
exposed, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
of O
high O
quality. O

The O
products B-TARGET
used O
are O
fresh O
and O
all O
we O
ate O
was O
super O
good. O

We O
will O
certainly O
go O
back O
there O
to O
eat O
under O
this O
magnificent O
plane O
tree B-TARGET
that O
represents O
the O
terrace O
of O
the O
south O
of O
France. O

Special O
mention O
to O
servers B-TARGET
for O
their O
professionalism. O

They O
know O
how O
to O
make O
clients O
comfortable O
by O
giving O
them O
good O
advice O
without O
disturbing O
them. O

Never O
go O
there!!! O

We O
expected O
something O
of O
very O
high O
quality, O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
ordinary O
and O
some O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
fads. O

The O
confit B-TARGET
doesn't O
look O
like O
a O
confit O
(it O
looks O
like O
a O
sausage) O
and O
the O
taste O
doesn't O
follow O
either. O

The O
croustade B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
St I-TARGET
James I-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
of O
our O
dishes O
(the O
holy B-TARGET
jacques I-TARGET
are O
generous O
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
good). O

Anyway, O
not O
bad, O
but O
a O
little O
disappointing. O

We O
had O
booked O
in O
this O
restaurant O
seeing O
that O
it O
was O
recommended O
by O
the O
Gault O
and O
Millau, O
it O
has O
a O
super O
nice O
decor B-TARGET
and O
everything O
seemed O
to O
be O
gathered O
to O
discover O
a O
new O
good O
table O
on O
Marseille. O

Unfortunately, O
what O
was O
not O
our O
disappointment! O

No O
wine O
at O
less O
than O
35 O
€ O
per O
bottle, B-TARGET
prices O
that O
would O
be O
justified O
if O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
was O
up O
to O
the O
level. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
was O
hard, O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
was O
frozen O
and O
tasteless. O

In O
addition, O
one O
of O
the O
guests O
was O
ill O
after O
the O
meal. B-TARGET

Remains O
the O
service, B-TARGET
friendly O
but O
a O
little O
too O
casual O
that O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
note O
the O
lack O
of O
quality O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Well, O
we're O
having O
a O
hard O
time O
falling, O
so O
we're O
gonna O
say O
it O
like O
that... O

Unhappy O
waiters, B-TARGET
aren't O
you O
from O
around O
here? O

Too O
bad! O

Count O
your O
change, O
believe O
me, O
you're O
quite O
interested. O

He O
did O
it O
to O
us, O
but O
we O
could O
see O
it O
that O
night, O
they O
did O
it O
to O
at O
least O
eight O
tables O
that O
complained. O

Well, O
of O
course O
the O
error O
was O
in O
their O
favor!!! O
almost O
twenty O
euros O
for O
us O
on O
an O
addition O
of O
85€! O

Almost O
20%!!! O
The O
most O
beautiful: O
without O
disassembly: O
"What O
is O
the O
tip!!!!" O
Nothing O
more O
to O
say O

When O
to O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
do O
not O
go O
there O
to O
make O
an O
original O
discovery, O
only O
"classic".... O

It O
looks O
like O
the O
restaurateurs O
are O
buying O
at O
Metro.... O

Coincidence?..... O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
by O
the O
water O
is O
nice. O

Especially O
since O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
rather O
pleasant, O
the O
generous O
portions B-TARGET
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
really O
nice. O

What O
fat O
is O
that? O

These O
poor O
octopus B-TARGET
could O
have O
died O
of O
an O
excess O
of O
cholesterol O
if O
they O
hadn't O
finished O
on O
the O
plancha. O

And O
hop, O
one O
afternoon O
to O
digest O
them. O

And O
I'm O
not O
talking O
about O
aioli... B-TARGET

So O
good O
but O
could O
really O
gain O
in O
quality. O

Last O
remark, O
why O
salmon?? O

Isn't O
there O
enough O
fish O
varieties O
in O
the O
Mediterranean? O

Come O
on, O
a O
little O
effort! O

We O
had O
liked O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
of O
the O
time O
of O
the O
old O
team O
but O
then O
there O
disappointment. O

After O
a O
reception B-TARGET
and O
an O
average O
service, B-TARGET
the O
map B-TARGET
seemed O
attractive O
but O
when O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
arrived O
it O
was O
not O
up O
to O
the O
level. O

The O
products B-TARGET
are O
good O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
remains O
simple O
compared O
to O
the O
prices. O

A O
salmon B-TARGET
tartare I-TARGET
with O
too O
many O
onions. O

A O
steamed O
salmon O
also O
served O
with O
onion O
sauce... O

A O
proposed O
profitole B-TARGET
XL O
but O
on O
the O
plate O
the O
cabbage B-TARGET
was O
too O
cooked, O
so O
disappointment, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
have O
a O
smaller O
but O
better O
profitole. O

The O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
compared O
to O
what O
we've O
been O
offered. O

Besides, O
there O
were O
only O
three O
tables O
in O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
one O
Friday O
night! O

But O
what O
happened? O

In O
2 O
months O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
deteriorated O
at O
a O
phenomenal O
speed! O

Total O
disorganization O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
forced O
to O
ask O
again O
several O
times O
the O
aperitif O
as O
well O
as O
the O
wine, O
to O
believe O
that O
they O
do O
not O
want O
to O
be O
consumed. O

An O
endless O
wait B-TARGET
before O
placing O
an O
order. O

Normal O
when O
waitresses B-TARGET
do O
not O
manage O
their O
tables...vacances O
goes O
and O
comes O
without O
any O
logic O
of O
service! B-TARGET

Luckily O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
catches O
up O
with O
this O
but O
what O
a O
waste O
for O
this O
little O
Italian O
restaurant O
with O
a O
beautiful O
terrace B-TARGET
and O
fresh O
produce. O

Please, O
Mr. O
Boss, O
put O
your O
organization O
in O
order. O

The O
person O
who O
welcomes O
and O
places O
people O
would O
do O
better O
to O
manage O
the O
service B-TARGET
instead O
of O
walking O
hands O
in O
the O
pockets. O

It O
is O
not O
understood O
to O
assign O
to O
each O
server O
a O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
so O
everyone O
can O
follow O
their O
orders O

I've O
been O
used O
to O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
years. O

Well, O
it's O
always O
as O
good. O

The O
formula B-TARGET
is O
perfect. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
always O
cooked O
as O
desired O
and O
if O
you O
don't O
have O
enough O
fries O
ask O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
it O
will O
bring O
you O
a O
plate. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive. O

In O
short, O
a O
Resto B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
come O
with O
friends O
to O
eat O
well O
and O
quickly O
if O
you O
wish O

It's O
almost O
by O
chance O
that O
we O
had O
dinner O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

We O
were O
positively O
surprised. O

First O
of O
all O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant, O
smiling O
and O
friendly. O

Unpretentious O
cuisine B-TARGET
remains O
simple O
and O
of O
good O
quality. O

Balanced O
servings, B-TARGET
except O
perhaps O
for O
the O
entry B-TARGET
(gratinated O
moulds) O
which O
was O
too O
small O
as O
the O
mussels B-TARGET
were O
good. O

The O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
was O
quite O
suitable O
and O
at O
a O
more O
than O
reasonable O
price, O
14 O
euros... O

We O
recommend O
this O
small O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
is O
located O
in O
the O
Shopping O
Cart O
district. O

A O
good O
surprise O
on O
the O
port B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Marseille. I-TARGET

Prices O
are O
correct, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
in O
quantity O
and O
with O
a O
wide O
choice O
(a O
cheese B-TARGET
tray I-TARGET
displays O
more O
than O
30 O
specimens!) O

Of O
course, O
this O
is O
not O
gastronomy, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
come O
to O
a O
buffet O
at O
will O
for O
this. O

So O
we O
go O
back O
and O
happy O
to O
have O
had O
a O
good O
time O
for O
not O
too O
expensive O
(on O
the O
port, B-TARGET
it's O
quite O
remarkable). O

Of O
course, O
this O
property B-TARGET
is O
well O
located, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
justify O
the O
prices O
charged O
for O
a O
fair O
and O
medium O
quality. O

The O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day O
as O
its O
name O
indicates O
is O
rather O
a O
guarantee O
of O
freshness O
and O
quality; O
that O
day O
if O
the O
boar B-TARGET
was O
suitable, O
the O
accompaniment B-TARGET
very O
limited O
to O
dry O
and O
cold O
pasta. B-TARGET

A O
good O
service, B-TARGET
but O
not O
to O
be O
renewed, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
small O
restaurants O
that O
can O
serve O
better O
quality O
cuisine O

I've O
known O
the O
address O
for O
a O
long O
time. O

but B-TARGET
big I-TARGET
disappointment: I-TARGET

A O
pretty O
good O
pizza B-TARGET
but O
served O
without O
cutlery? O

A O
3.7 O
euro O
pressure B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
without O
a O
bubble O
with O
a O
taste O
of O
water, O
in O
short O
a O
beer O
cut O
by O
water. O

Waiter's O
answer: O
Yes, O
we're O
having O
drum O
problems O
right O
now? O

(with O
a O
small O
smile O
around O
the O
corner) O

I O
tried O
my O
luck O
with O
a O
beer B-TARGET
bottle I-TARGET
6 O
euros O
open O
arrival O
with O
a O
lemon O
puck O
inside?? O

Idem O
without O
bubble O
and O
a O
taste O
of O
water. O

The O
neighbor O
at O
the O
next O
table O
sent O
back O
her O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
on O
the O
pretext O
that O
there O
were O
so O
many O
ice O
cubes O
that O
she O
no O
longer O
had O
the O
taste O
of O
wine. O

As O
mentioned O
earlier: O
don't O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom, O
disgusting! O

18-year-old O
servers B-TARGET
very O
nice O
but O
tips O
not O
possible O
there.... O

It's O
a O
shame. O

This O
must O
not O
be O
condoned O
at O
all!! O

Perhaps O
by O
masochist O
spirit, O
I O
went O
back O
to O
this O
"restaurant" B-TARGET
and O
said O
that O
maybe... O
nothing O
has O
changed, O
no O
one O
has O
changed, O
with O
ill-dressed, O
poorly O
dressed, O
unprofessional O
staff.We B-TARGET
wait O
20 O
minutes O
to O
get O
the O
card, O
if O
we O
don't O
take O
an O
aperitif. O

the O
situation B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
st O
detestable, O
it O
is O
a O
tourist B-TARGET
feeder, I-TARGET
as O
is O
the O
place O
where O
one O
really O
"waits" O
the O
tourist. O

Fresh O
glass B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
bottled B-TARGET
rather O
expensive O
and O
a O
beer B-TARGET
bottled I-TARGET
little O
covancing O

canteen O
service, B-TARGET
the O
waitress B-TARGET
carries O
the O
"soup" O
of O
fish O
in O
her O
2 O
hands O
by O
what O
the O
plate O
is O
hot, O
without O
bed, O
without O
class O
really O

We O
eat O
more O
than O
we O
eat O
there O
to O
really O
avoid O

Attracted O
by O
the O
frontage O
being O
rather O
chic, O
certainly O
the O
price O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at O
15€ O
did O
not O
inspire O
a O
refined O
cuisine... O
but O
there O
it O
is O
worse O
than O
everything... O

Frozen O
but O
not O
good O
frozen!!! O
Marinated O
chickens... O
that O
is, O
a O
octopus B-TARGET
that O
looks O
like O
real O
rubber O
with O
vinegar.... O
basically O
a O
simple O
salad! O

Marine B-TARGET
mussels I-TARGET
that O
bathe... O
in O
their O
water O
yes O
without O
sauce: O
no O
interest!!! O

For O
me O
the O
worst O
is O
the O
service!! B-TARGET

A O
non-existent O
management: B-TARGET
15 O
to O
20 O
minutes O
of O
waiting B-TARGET
between O
each O
dish, O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
serves O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
next O
door O
but O
who O
only O
disembarks O
us O
10 O
minutes O
after...and O
the O
must... O
when O
the O
choice O
of O
dessert B-TARGET
there O
was O
only O
one O
red O
fruit O
dessert O
left O
on O
the O
4 O
possibilities O
of O
the O
menu... O
my O
friend O
not O
loving O
them...the O
boss B-TARGET
refused O
to O
exchange O
the O
coffee O
for O
the O
dessert O
he O
did O
not O
take...... O

A O
naz O
customer O
relationship! O

As O
for O
the O
sour O
and O
sparkling O
fruit B-TARGET
salad... I-TARGET
I O
think O
they O
put O
orangina O
on O
it... O

Why?! O
I O
would O
never O
know!!! O

Do O
not O
let O
yourself O
be O
caught O
by O
the O
attractive O
price O
and O
the O
front, O
competitors O
practice O
the O
same O
types O
of O
menus O
and O
are O
more O
quali O
and O
pleasant O

Beachfront O
restaurant B-TARGET
ideally O
located. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
warm O
welcome. B-TARGET

Nevertheless, O
expensive O
meals, B-TARGET
without O
great O
choice, O
heavy O
and O
very O
fat. O

I'm O
not O
going O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
even O
after O
10 O
hours O
of O
digestion, O
the O
hot B-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
still O
hasn't O
passed. O

....what O
a O
cold O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
what O
an O
antipathetic O
service! B-TARGET

Brunch O
lovers O
we O
went O
there O
on O
a O
Sunday O
to O
brunch O
in O
the O
sun O
on O
the O
terrace: B-TARGET
brunch B-TARGET
is O
served O
at O
the O
table O
and O
not O
as O
a O
buffet, O
it O
is O
copious O
and O
rather O
good: O
there O
are O
eggs, O
bacon, O
sausage, O
pastries, O
salmon O
and O
fruit O
salad, O
white O
cheese O
among O
others, O
its O
price O
is O
correct, O
however O
we O
were O
very O
disappointed O
in O
the O
service: B-TARGET
waitress B-TARGET
speed O
and O
unkind, O
she O
did O
not O
take O
away O
the O
plate O
of O
salt O
while O
she O
had O
brought O
us O
coffee O
for O
pastries, O
we O
ate O
our O
waffles O
on O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
table O
not O
to O
mix O
them O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
sausage....not O
very O
pro! O

We O
asked O
her O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it, O
she O
didn't O
do O
it O
but O
passed O
three O
times O
in O
front O
of O
us O
empty O
hands... O
that's O
very O
average. O

Too O
bad O
because O
brunch B-TARGET
was O
nice O
but O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
do O
not O
deserve O
us O
to O
come O
back. O

At O
first O
we O
had O
the O
impression O
of O
disturbing, O
at O
the O
limit O
not O
too O
serious O
tourist O
city O
and O
many O
people O
so O
I O
think O
the O
waiters O
tired. O

Once O
the O
meal B-TARGET
at O
the O
table, O
a O
disaster, O
not O
to O
mention O
mistakes O
or O
oblivions, O
an O
impression O
of O
damaged O
meat B-TARGET
and O
I O
pass O
it... O

When O
we O
went O
to O
the O
bathroom O
we O
saw O
an O
establishment B-TARGET
in O
a O
state O
more O
than O
laborious, O
worse O
than O
in O
our O
worst O
nightmares, O
dirty, O
dilapidated, O
how O
can O
we O
make O
food O
in O
such O
a O
place, O
I O
felt O
bad O
to O
see O
that. O

Close O
it O
right O
away. O

Please O
go O
somewhere O
else, O
thank O
you. O

Under O
the O
sun O
of O
the O
Estaque, O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
has O
a O
nice O
little O
decor B-TARGET
(table O
teak O
way, O
"sets" O
in O
slate). O

The O
big O
+ O
is O
the O
smileful O
welcome O
of O
the O
2 O
waitresses, B-TARGET
available O
and O
familiar O
with O
the O
dishes. O

Chosen O
a O
freshly B-TARGET
fished I-TARGET
sea I-TARGET
wolf I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
its I-TARGET
ratatouille I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
puree I-TARGET
accompanied I-TARGET
by I-TARGET
an I-TARGET
olive I-TARGET
oil I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
citrus I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
herbs, I-TARGET
all O
of O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
little O
insipid. O

I O
am O
all O
the O
more O
sorry O
to O
write O
it O
as O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
happiness O
of O
kindness. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
did O
not O
leave O
me O
a O
memorable O
memory O
(a O
gourmet O
tea). O

Can O
do O
better, O
I'm O
sure! O

A O
must! O

A O
cuisine B-TARGET
always O
fresh O
and O
fine, O
very O
good O
products, B-TARGET
cooked O
with O
talent O
and O
love. O

A O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
always O
perfect O
service, B-TARGET
a O
very O
good O
choice O
of O
wine B-TARGET
(even O
pitchers B-TARGET
are O
very O
good), O
aperitifs B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
test O
coktails!! B-TARGET

Invented O
and O
carefully O
prepared O
by O
the O
super O
bartender!! O

Between O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
summer O
and O
the O
tables O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
fireplace B-TARGET
in O
winter, O
the O
music, B-TARGET
the O
setting B-TARGET
gathers O
all O
the O
ingredients O
to O
spend O
a O
superb O
evening. O

We're O
going O
with O
our O
eyes O
closed! O

To O
read O
the O
various O
praiseworthy O
comments, O
I O
wonder O
a O
little O
if O
I O
was O
in O
the O
same O
place B-TARGET
or O
if O
I O
was O
in O
a O
bad O
mood O
that O
day... O

That O
being O
said, O
I O
did O
not O
find O
the O
staff B-TARGET
friendly, O
certainly O
we O
finished O
lunch O
a O
little O
late O
(16h) O
but O
we O
got O
pushed O
towards O
the O
exit O
because O
the O
restaurant O
closed O
(what O
good O
if O
it O
is O
to O
reopen O
two O
hours O
later?!). O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
does O
not O
leave O
any O
particular, O
rather O
standard O
memory O
and O
for O
the O
price O
in O
the O
end, O
you O
can O
frankly O
expect O
much O
better! O

Anyway, O
doesn't O
match O
what O
I O
was O
told O
or O
what O
I O
read O
about O
this O
restaurant... B-TARGET

Tastes O
and O
colors O
no O
doubt O
:-) O

We O
were O
5 O
this O
day O
wanting O
to O
have O
lunch O
in O
terasse O
of O
this O
establishment, O
with O
its O
great O
choice O
the O
map B-TARGET
is O
suitable O
for O
everyone. O

Once O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
15 O
minutes O
to O
order O
our O
drinks O
and O
have O
the O
cards, O
again O
15 O
minutes O
later O
the O
server O
returns O
to O
take O
our O
order O
it O
is O
the O
one O
that O
he O
announces O
to O
us O
that O
there O
are O
no O
pizzas, O
no O
hamburger O
or O
canlonis... O

If O
this O
had O
been O
communicated O
to O
us O
by O
setting O
up O
we O
would O
have O
decided O
to O
change O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
had O
to O
take O
the O
olives O
left O
by O
the O
customers O
of O
the O
side O
table O
(with O
the O
nuclei O
on O
the O
table O
that O
were O
not O
picked O
up O
during O
our O
waiting) O
I O
ask O
for O
an O
ashtray O
to O
put O
our O
nuclei O
in O
it O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
tells O
me O
"you O
ask O
for O
things O
you" O

As O
we O
were O
drinking O
our O
drinks O
we O
decided O
to O
make O
an O
effort O
by O
ordering O
all O
a O
meat, O
not O
seeing O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
come O
back O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
10 O
minutes O
we O
rose O
to O
go O
to O
the O
tobacco O
office O
to O
settle O
the O
note O
after O
having O
to O
wait O
because O
only O
one O
box O
the O
boss B-TARGET
asks O
me O
in O
an O
average O
kind O
way O
the O
table O
number. O

"we O
can't O
pay O
without O
the O
table O
number, O
I O
need O
the O
table O
number." O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
very O
pretty O
"mountain" O
setting, B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
true O
that O
the O
smell B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
unpleasant O
when O
entering O
the O
room. O

At O
the O
same O
time, O
we O
are O
in O
a O
fondue O
restaurant, O
so O
no O
surprises O
on O
this O
point O
there. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
smiling O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
client. O

A O
little O
flat O
for O
a O
lady O
who O
was O
part O
of O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
who O
was O
not O
much O
more O
unpleasant. O

It O
still O
remains O
a O
good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
to O
test. O

Already O
on O
arrival, O
the O
setting B-TARGET
is O
exceptional! O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
at O
the O
bottom O
left O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
3 O
meters O
from O
the O
sea; O
the O
beach O
is O
on O
the O
right O
side O
(on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
restaurant O
room) O
so O
we O
are O
not O
"disturbed" O
by O
the O
plasterers. O

As O
for O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
it O
is O
delicate, O
refined O
and O
in O
generous O
portions! O

Arriving O
fish B-TARGET
daily, O
so O
extra O
fresh. O

For O
those O
who O
don't O
like O
fish, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
diverse; O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
very O
gourmet!!! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
casual, O
the O
server B-TARGET
makes O
you O
feel O
comfortable O
right O
away. O

Everything O
is O
certainly O
not O
given, O
but O
a O
dish O
and O
dessert O
remain O
affordable. O

Quality O
meal B-TARGET
at O
very O
correct O
take. O

Fresh O
products B-TARGET
with O
good O
positions O
of O
the O
team B-TARGET
that O
is O
at O
the O
small O
care. O

The O
little O
plus O
a O
card B-TARGET
has O
very O
attractive O
catch. O

An O
excellent O
little O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
homemade O
dishes, B-TARGET
which O
makes O
a O
small O
menu B-TARGET
but O
with O
dishes O
with O
exquisite O
taste. O

I O
can O
only O
advise O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
an O
excellent O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
good O
cuisine. B-TARGET

A O
bistro B-TARGET
the O
way O
I O
like O
it. O

Here O
you O
are O
received O
as O
it O
should O
be. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
simple O
but O
of O
very O
good O
quality. O

Very O
nice O
service B-TARGET
on O
a O
beautiful O
terrace. B-TARGET

The O
tourist O
came O
right O
here O
and O
there's O
no O
scam. O

Prices O
are O
reasonable O
and O
consumption O
is O
not O
forced. O

An O
address B-TARGET
to O
note O
during O
your O
passages O
in O
Marseille. O

The O
proximity O
of O
parking O
will O
make O
your O
stay O
cooler. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
define O
the O
framework B-TARGET
already, O
I O
would O
say O
bluffing. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
sublime, O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant O
and O
quiet. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
very O
fine, O
perfectly O
adapted O
in O
quantity. O

The O
hiccup: O
the O
service, B-TARGET
which O
should O
be O
slightly O
better O
for O
a O
restaurant O
of O
this O
level O
(aperitifs O
arrived O
15 O
minutes O
apart, O
two O
waiters O
wanted O
to O
settle O
us...), O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
attention. O

However O
the O
staff B-TARGET
remains O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
wait B-TARGET
is O
not O
excessive O
(except O
for O
the O
aperitif, O
therefore). O

We O
were O
regulars O
of O
this O
guinguette O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
was O
at O
the O
time O
very O
pleasant O
with O
a O
magnificent O
view B-TARGET
of O
the O
old O
port O
and O
with O
unpretentious O
food B-TARGET
with O
good O
simple O
and O
fresh O
products.... B-TARGET

But O
what O
happened, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
become O
a O
very O
expensive O
tourist O
catch O
without O
any O
quality!!! O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
deplorable O
and O
the O
whole O
restaurant O
thinks O
it's O
a O
3* O
while O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
very O
bad!! O

We O
are O
very O
sad O
and O
very O
disappointed..we O
were O
with O
Marseillais O
who O
also O
found O
this O
very O
bad, O
one O
of O
our O
friends O
even O
been O
ill O
all O
night O
after O
the O
meal.. O

We O
won't O
go O
back.. O

Too O
bad, O
it's O
really O
messed O
up!! O

Restaurant O
visited O
one O
evening O

Typical O

The O

everything O

well. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
(very O
copious, O
and O
refreshed O
if O
needed) O
with O

breaking O
the O

No O

Starting O
with O
the O
warm O

very O
friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
(accept O
us O
to O
14 O
a O
November O

would O
not O
have O
done O
so) O

A O
simple O
yet O
very O
authentic O
and O
studied O
setting... B-TARGET
an O
American O
style O
from O
the O
70s O
all O
in O
simplicity O
and O
taste. O

The O
heart... O
the O
meal! B-TARGET

Whether O
it O
is O
the O
entrances... B-TARGET
a O
very O
affordable O
price O
(between O
5 O
and O
7 O
euros) O
for O
an O
exceptional O
price/quality O
ratio. O

I O
recommend O
salmon B-TARGET
tartare I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Thai. I-TARGET

Then O
the O
dishes... O
no O
doubts O
the O
very O
controlled O
specialty O
is O
the O
home O
burger! B-TARGET

A O
bread B-TARGET
made O
by O
a O
corner O
baker, O
a O
fresh O
chopped B-TARGET
steak, I-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
fresh B-TARGET
produce, I-TARGET
homemade O
fries, B-TARGET
the O
little O
salad B-TARGET
accompanied O
by O
a O
well-up O
vinaigrette. O

Let's O
not O
be O
afraid O
of O
words...to O
this O
day O
it's O
the O
best O
burger B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
eaten. O

Even O
if O
it's O
a O
fashionable O
concept... O
few O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
master O
it O
like O

We O
had O
lunch O
yesterday O
in O
this O
restaurant O
with O
sea O
view B-TARGET
and O
very O
nice O
terrace. B-TARGET

We O
were O
greeted O
on O
the O
terrace, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
I O
had O
ordered O
blue O
cooking O
arrived O
"bloody", O
not O
terrible O
for O
a O
meat O
specialist O
restaurant! B-TARGET

But O
good O
for O
not O
doing O
the O
hard O
thing, O
I O
still O
eat O
it O
without O
turning O
it O
back O
into O
the O
kitchen O
and O
wasting O
it. O

When O
the O
waiter O
asks O
us O
if O
it's O
okay, O
I O
tell O
him O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
that O
the O
cooking O
wasn't O
the O
one O
I O
asked O
for. O

And O
there, O
what O
a O
surprise O
the O
server B-TARGET
is O
vexing, O
it O
is O
not O
understanding, O
it O
brings O
us O
the O
addition, O
we O
settle O
and O
it O
does O
not O
even O
say O
goodbye!!! O
What O
professionalism!!!! O
given O
his O
behavior O
and O
his O
young O
age, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
maturity, O
manager O
there O
is O
urgent! O

In O
view O
of O
this O
welcome, B-TARGET
we O
won't O
come O
back! O

Restaurant O
visited O
for O
family O
occasion. O

Very O
good O
welcome, B-TARGET
discreet O
and O
efficient. O

Good O
meal, B-TARGET
refined, O
in O
a O
good O
timing. B-TARGET

A O
beautiful O
and O
great O
classic, B-TARGET
which O
will O
not O
disappoint, O
whatever O
the O
tastes, O
big O
and O
small. O

Good O
cellar B-TARGET
well O
valued O
by O
good O
advice O
in O
the O
room. O

Together O
a O
little O
expensive O
for O
those O
who O
blow O
up O
a O
few O
consecutive O
plugs... O

Quality/price O
ratio O
acceptable. O

Infamous O
taste O
dishes B-TARGET
warmed O
up O
with O
microwaves! O

A O
cold O
welcome! B-TARGET

And O
to O
top O
off O
all O
the O
blattes O
were O
invited O
to O
our O
table! O

We've O
been O
sick! O

This O
establishment B-TARGET
should O
be O
closed! O

Noisy O
canine O
and O
without O
any O
other O
charm O
than O
the O
one, O
a O
little O
rascal, O
unwashed O
photos O
of O
the O
"people" O
who O
once O
frequented O
the O
place. O

And O
finally, O
what O
is O
this O
story O
of O
not O
presenting O
a O
card O
to O
customers O
in O
2013? O

Overrated O
reputation O
for O
an O
address B-TARGET
that O
surfs O
the O
fashion O
that O
wears O
the O
neighborhood. O

When O
Marseille O
institutions O
fall O
asleep O
on O
their O
reputation, O
they O
are O
no O
longer O
frequented O
only O
by O
tourists. O

The O
Marseillais, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
fall O
back O
on O
the O
new O
addresses O
opened O
by O
the O
new O
arrivals O
in O
the O
city... O

The O
frame B-TARGET
is O
exceptional, O
just O
that, O
it's O
worth O
it. O

On O
the O
bollabaisse B-TARGET
side, O
we O
present O
you O
a O
huge O
fish B-TARGET
tray I-TARGET
before O
cooking. O

But O
they O
had O
to O
shrink O
when O
they O
cooked, O
two O
pieces O
full O
of O
ridges, O
huge O
onions, O
a O
little O
juice... O

We O
stay O
on O
his O
hunger, O
we O
ask O
for O
it O
again, O
but O
there's O
no O
rab. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
bottles B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
do O
not O
wait O
to O
be O
replaced, O
and O
there O
the O
addition O
is O
more O
than O
salty. O

Mistrust, O
tourists O
get O
lightened O
the O
wallet. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
if O
you O
like O
dim O
light, O
are O
students O
or O
bobo/hipster. O

Come O
early O
because O
it O
fills O
quickly. O

Affordable O
tapas, B-TARGET
except O
for O
the O
manchego B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
(five O
thin O
slices O
for O
5€) O
and O
the O
serrano B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
(6 O
slices O
for O
10€). O

The O
mastrone B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
noisy O
but O
it O
adds O
conviviality O
to O
everything. O

Not O
the O
best O
food B-TARGET
I O
ate, O
but O
for O
the O
price O
we O
don't O
complain. O

The O
dishes O
arrive O
quickly. O

Avoid B-TARGET
going I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
big I-TARGET
group, I-TARGET
six O
people O
is O
already O
a O
lot. O

PIZZA B-TARGET
is O
so O
thin O
that O
it O
is O
inescapable: O
you O
have O
to O
break O
it. O

Fresh O
goat B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
gourmet B-TARGET
coffees I-TARGET
for O
9 O
€, O
dusty O
setting, B-TARGET
unprofessional O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
quickly O
the O
note O
reaches O
40 O
€ O
to O
eat B-TARGET
badly. I-TARGET

In O
short, O
the O
environment O
of O
the O
site B-TARGET
does O
not O
justify O
the O
move O
to O
this O
"restaurant" B-TARGET
which O
is O
wondered O
if O
the O
renters O
have O
learned O
to O
cook O
and O
know O
what O
a O
business O
is. O

Small O
friendly O
market O
restaurant, B-TARGET
aperitif B-TARGET
planchettes I-TARGET
are O
good. O

Beef B-TARGET
is O
of O
fantastic O
quality, O
many O
wines B-TARGET
are O
available O
for O
glass, O
tartar B-TARGET
is O
not O
terrible O
because O
too O
much O
mustard O
in O
the O
mixture... O
besides O
mustard O
in O
tartar... O
weird. O

Otherwise O
ambiance B-TARGET
nice O
to O
deix O
steps O
from O
god. B-TARGET

Well, O
there's O
better. O

Let O
the O
chef O
try O
to O
relive O
Lyon B-TARGET
classics, I-TARGET
why O
not O
if O
he O
did O
it O
with O
talent. O

Unfortunately O
said O
menu B-TARGET
with O
typical O
Lyon O
accents O
is O
not O
only O
bad O
but O
at O
the O
limit O
of O
grotesque. O

Beyond O
that, O
(1) O
the O
room B-TARGET
would O
feel O
a O
refreshment, O
(2) O
the O
boss B-TARGET
should O
learn O
to O
smile O
and O
(3), O
the O
prices O
are O
delusional O
given O
the O
poor O
cuisine B-TARGET
we O
have O
been O
served. O

To O
the O
maximum O
should O
we O
have O
paid O
25 O
euros O
/ O
head O
for O
such O
a O
mediocre O
meal, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
at O
prices O
of O
this O
order O
there O
is O
much O
better O
in O
Lyon O
and O
than O
at O
prohibitive O
prices O
that O
it O
practices, O
there O
is O
also O
much O
better O
in O
Lyon O
and O
especially O
in O
the O
surroundings, O
including O
stars O
worthy O
of O
this O
name! O

Second O
visit O
to O
this O
small O
Lyon O
restaurant. O

A O
real O
disappointment! O

Poor, O
tasteless O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
we O
came O
out O
hungry! O

Too O
bad! O

290€ O
for O
4 O
people, O
with O
a O
homemade O
aperitif, O
a O
coca, O
2 O
glasses O
of O
wine... O

The O
note O
is O
salty O
and O
does O
not O
match O
what O
is O
happening O
on O
the O
plate! B-TARGET

Very O
medium, O
for O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
has O
been O
on O
the O
square O
for O
a O
long O
time O
in O
Saint O
Etienne. O

We O
wanted O
to O
do O
this O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
we O
won't O
go O
back O
and O
we O
advise O
against O
it. O

In O
the O
desert O
room, B-TARGET
there O
were O
six O
of O
us, O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night... O

Grands O
Gourmand O
menu, O
2 O
dishes, O
4 O
€ O
extra O
for O
cheese... B-TARGET

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
nice O
though. O

Appetizing O
dishes B-TARGET
but O
we O
expected O
a O
better O
taste. O

Quality/price O
ratio O
acceptable. O

Friendly O
welcome B-TARGET
but O
service B-TARGET
a O
little O
speed. O

Whether O
at O
the O
counter O
or O
at O
the O
drive, O
the O
wait B-TARGET
is O
long. O

Hot O
products B-TARGET
are O
provided O
cold O
(frites,...) O
and O
there O
are O
still O
items O
missing O
from O
the O
order O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
recurring O
oblivion O
of O
sauces, O
straws O
and O
towels. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
leaves O
to O
be O
desired O
for O
this O
great O
sign. O

Super O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
very O
well O
informed O
setting O
about O
South O
American O
specialties!!!!! O

Nice O
cocktail B-TARGET
very O
well O
eating O
to O
redo O
as O
soon O
as O
possible!!!!! O

I've O
known O
this O
restaurant O
for O
many O
years O
for O
bringing O
guests. O

For O
almost O
ten O
years O
I O
had O
not O
returned O
and O
here O
I O
came O
back O
this O
year O
and O
not O
too O
disappointed O
though... O
as O
I O
expected O
to O
find O
a O
temple O
of O
gastronomy, O
the O
bar O
was O
a O
little O
high. O

That O
said, O
quality O
is O
always O
on O
schedule, O
prices O
are O
also... O
but O
quality O
has O
a O
price O
and O
when O
it's O
very O
good O
and O
tasteful O
it's O
never O
too O
expensive. O

A O
little O
isolated O
on O
this O
J O
Janin O
Boulevard O
but O
parking O
remains O
possible O
without O
going O
too O
far. O

To O
advise O
therefore O

I've O
been O
eating O
down O
there O
for O
years O
and O
I've O
brought O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
customers... O

I O
recommend O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
which O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
mulhouse O
kebab. O

Delicious O
white B-TARGET
sauce!!!! I-TARGET

As O
for O
the O
very O
smiling O
and O
pleasant O
staff. B-TARGET

We O
have O
dinner O
on O
a O
Sunday O
evening, O
good O
fresh O
meal B-TARGET
nothing O
exceptional O
but O
pleasant! O

Nice O
service! B-TARGET

A O
good O
Thai! B-TARGET

A O
very O
unwarming O
welcome, B-TARGET
a O
very O
long O
wait B-TARGET
for O
a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
really O
is O
not O
worth O
its O
price! O

I O
wouldn't O
go O
back. O

Welcome B-TARGET
disastrous, O
out O
of O
3 O
servers, B-TARGET
only O
1 O
of O
them O
said O
hello, O
the O
servers O
are O
on O
their O
phone O
behind O
the O
bar, O
laugh O
between O
them, O
obviously O
being O
rusty. O

The O
worst O
part O
is O
the O
toilet. O

A O
disaster, O
all O
toilets O
being O
full O
of O
excrement, O
no O
toilet O
paper, O
toilets O
at O
staff B-TARGET
level.... O

To O
avoid O
it O
absolutely, O
take O
your O
legs O
to O
your O
neck. O

Nice O
welcome, B-TARGET
nice O
place, B-TARGET
nice O
map! B-TARGET

All O
the O
burgers B-TARGET
are O
tempting. O

Some O
stock O
management O
concerns, O
several O
dishes B-TARGET
not O
available... O

Too O
bad O
for O
a O
Saturday O
night! O

several O
meals B-TARGET
at O
lunchtime, O
often O
flat O
of O
the O
day, O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money O
for O
fish O
restaurant B-TARGET

A O
chain B-TARGET
restaurant, I-TARGET
we O
pushed O
the O
door O
because O
in O
general, O
without O
being O
extraordinary O
it O
is O
a O
value O
on, O
not O
too O
expensive O
and O
fast. O

Not O
here, O
approximate O
cleanliness, O
complicated O
service, B-TARGET
when O
to O
pizza, B-TARGET
zero. O

No O
luck O
that O
day O
or O
real O
lack O
of O
quality? O

I'm O
not O
going O
back... O

Superb O
welcome. B-TARGET

The O
seats O
are O
very O
comfortable O
and O
the O
frame B-TARGET
is O
clean. O

A O
25€ O
menu B-TARGET
can O
allow O
you O
to O
eat O
well O
without O
ruining O
yourself O
too, O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
are O
very O
rich O
as O
well. O

Taste O
the O
puree B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
truffles, I-TARGET
a O
treat! O

To O
recommend O
closed O
eyes! O

I O
ate O
in O
this O
restaurant O
for O
the O
second O
time O
today. O

Friday, O
a O
burger. O

It's O
just O
the O
best O
I've O
ever O
eaten! O

Good, O
organic, O
perfect O
cooking, O
hot, O
fragrant O
and O
slightly O
spicy! O

Today, O
a O
sweet O
beef O
cooked O
with O
vegetables.. O

Everything O
corresponds O
100% O
to O
my O
tastes O
and O
expectations. O

Freshness, O
taste, O
balance, O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

In O
addition, O
all O
served O
by O
a O
very O
friendly O
waitress! B-TARGET

What O
more O
can O
I O
ask? O

Located O
in O
a O
small O
street O
in O
the O
old O
centre O
of O
Gap, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
well O
decorated. O

We O
could O
almost O
think O
of O
each O
other O
in O
Brittany. O

The O
little O
card B-TARGET
is O
very O
appetizing... O
alas O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
by O
the O
Gallettes, B-TARGET
not O
very O
large, O
not O
very O
tasteful, O
not O
very O
loaded... O

I'm O
a O
gourmand. O

Cider B-TARGET
is O
good... O

AND O
pancakes B-TARGET
are O
EXCELLENT O
(pat B-TARGET
and O
accompaniments). B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
pro. O

There's O
not O
much O
missing O
at O
this O
address B-TARGET
so O
I O
can O
go O
back O
there O
willingly. O

It's O
Gap's O
best O
pizza O
and O
even O
see O
France.... O
Ask O
Chris' O
"like O
DAB"... O

A O
mixture O
of O
everything O
with O
fresh O
cream O
on O
top, O
all O
on O
a O
delicious O
and O
perfectly O
cooked O
paste... B-TARGET

This O
really O
needs O
to O
be O
detoured.... O

If O
you O
don't O
have O
time, O
ask O
to O
take O
it O
away..... O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
a O
Friday O
night O
with O
friends. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
correct O
the O
friendly O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
speak O
without O
shouting O
because O
of O
the O
noise. O

The O
music B-TARGET
was O
really O
very O
strong. O

Ultra O
negative O
point: O
at O
the O
end O
of O
our O
meal O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
gives O
us O
the O
addition O
without O
we O
asked O
for O
it. O

And O
we O
say O
text: O
if O
you O
want O
coffee O
or O
digestive O
it O
eSt O
in O
5 O
min O
Max O
at O
the O
bar!!!!!!!! O

I O
booked O
a O
table O
at O
9pm O
not O
from O
9pm O
to O
10pm!!! O
I O
find O
this O
very O
average. O

I O
wouldn't O
go O
back. O

Respects O
completely O
its O
name O
as O
a O
mountain O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Very O
rich O
dishes, B-TARGET
local O
products B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
impeccable O
service B-TARGET
immersed O
in O
a O
very O
good O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Another O
positive O
point O
is O
a O
very O
reasonable O
cost. O

Go O
there O
with O
confidence O
if O
you O
want O
a O
simple, O
honest O
and O
generous O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Pleasant O
frame B-TARGET
and O
formula B-TARGET
for O
two O
well O
served O
with O
good O
products! B-TARGET

A O
beautiful O
mountain O
map B-TARGET
also, O
and O
excellent O
ice B-TARGET
cream O
to O
taste O
in O
the O
summer O
in O
the O
small O
garden B-TARGET
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

Already O
came O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
keeping O
an O
excellent O
memory O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
back. O

Arrived O
at O
8 O
there O
was O
only O
one O
table O
of O
busy O
people O
who O
believed O
that O
9 O
people O
had O
been O
better O
informed. O

We O
all O
took O
the O
menu O
at O
29, O
being O
good O
eaters O
he O
looked O
very O
attractive. O

The O
result O
of O
the O
salad B-TARGET
in O
sachet O
with O
a O
ridiculous O
cheese B-TARGET
toast I-TARGET
on O
a O
large O
slice O
of O
mie O
bread O
and O
catastrophic O
dishes... B-TARGET

No O
accompaniment O
noted O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
was O
served O
we O
had O
frozen O
fries B-TARGET
thrown O
on O
our O
meats B-TARGET
to O
camouflage O
misery O
and O
grilled O
beans B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
had O
fish. O

And O
the O
disaster O
of O
dessert B-TARGET
to O
continue. O

In O
short, O
we O
pointed O
it O
out O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
told O
us O
to O
agree O
as O
much O
as O
we O
would O
have O
changed O
the O
menu O
in O
the O
morning O
in O
the O
kitchen O
but O
not O
on O
paper. O

29 O
euros O
is O
expensive O
for O
frozen O
and O
sachet. B-TARGET

We O
went O
there O
twice O
in O
fifteen O
days O
and O
before O
varied O
the O
chosen O
dishes. O

As O
a O
result, O
everything O
is O
very O
good, O
with O
special O
mention O
to O
the O
ravioles B-TARGET
in O
the O
entrance O
and O
to O
the O
flat O
guinea B-TARGET
fowl. I-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
a O
little O
below. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
warm. O

We'll O
go O
back! O

To O
avoid... O

Salad B-TARGET
in O
correct O
entry O
then O
what O
a O
disappointment O
for O
tartar! B-TARGET

This O
one O
was O
for O
me O
raw O
meat O
covered O
with O
ketchup. O

I'm O
not O
talking O
about O
accompaniment! B-TARGET

Too O
bad O
my O
opinion O
was O
heard O
during O
the O
meal. O

No O
proposal O
for O
change O
or O
commercial O
gesture. O

With O
my O
spouse, O
great O
lovers O
of O
Asian O
restaurants, O
we O
were O
very O
disappointed. O

The O
nems B-TARGET
are O
correct, O
the O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
small O
(we O
went O
out O
with O
barely O
enough O
food), O
the O
crispy B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
is O
not O
and O
bathed O
in O
fat. O

The O
prices O
are O
high O
enough O
for O
what O
we O
ate. O

Let's O
not O
talk O
about O
the O
forced O
smile O
of O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
but O
we O
were O
warned O
on O
this O
point. O

We're O
not O
going O
back! O

Lymphatic O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
good O
pizzas B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
salads B-TARGET
terasse B-TARGET
and O
only O
incovene O
a O
staircase O
to O
climb O
if O
no O
place O
down O

200 O
meters O
from O
home O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
want O
a O
pizza, O
I'm O
going O
over O
there. O

The O
smell O
is O
already O
appealing O
when O
you O
walk O
past O
it. O

The O
boss B-TARGET
is O
really O
cool O
and O
I O
even O
got O
a O
free O
pizza O
without O
asking O
for O
anything. O

Bressane B-TARGET
is O
my O
favorite. O

The O
dough B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
well O
garnished. O

Go O
on O
like O
this O
is O
happiness! O

A O
bit O
high O
à O
la O
carte B-TARGET
rate O
except O
for O
the O
day's B-TARGET
formula. I-TARGET

Good O
cooking, B-TARGET
a O
little O
flat O
for O
service. B-TARGET

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
where O
we O
have O
the O
embarrassment O
of O
choice O
to O
sit O
down. O

Permanently O
empty, O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
a O
decorative O
display O
of O
the O
street... O

We O
are O
kindly O
welcomed O
by O
the O
owner, B-TARGET
big O
smile. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
low-end O
and O
flashing. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
good, O
typical, O
the O
map B-TARGET
offers O
a O
lot O
of O
choices. O

So O
one O
wonders O
how O
to O
serve O
fresh O
products O
with O
so O
little O
attendance O
and O
such O
a O
card. O

I O
wonder. O

An O
oasis O
of O
calm, O
where O
one O
must O
whisper O
to O
speak O
because O
it O
resonates: O
everything O
is O
empty! O

The O
prices O
charged O
are O
correct. O

A O
pleasant O
and O
well O
located O
outdoor O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
made O
us O
want O
to O
have O
lunch. O

From O
the O
entrance O
the O
server's O
reception B-TARGET
was O
quite O
cold. O

Comes O
the O
dishes, O
for O
my O
part O
a O
fillet B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
vivaneau I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
Vietnamese I-TARGET
(just O
covered O
with O
a O
hot O
sweet O
industrial O
Chile O
sauce) B-TARGET
and O
accompanied O
by O
sautéed B-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
(water...) O
which O
is O
in O
addition O
to O
6€. O

Total O
22€ O
the O
fish, B-TARGET
scandalous! O

The O
other O
2 O
guests O
took O
a O
bo B-TARGET
bun I-TARGET
composed O
of O
a O
poor O
nem O
cut O
in O
4, O
salad, O
vermicelle O
and O
beef B-TARGET
that O
I O
wouldn't O
even O
give O
to O
my O
dog. O

And O
to O
conclude O
the O
boss's B-TARGET
only O
answer O
"maybe O
you O
have O
the O
taste O
of O
someone O
who O
eats O
fast O
food." O

Scandalous!!!! O

In O
the O
city O
centre, O
rue O
La O
Bourdonnais, O
it's O
not O
easy O
to O
park O
at O
noon O
during O
the O
week. O

The O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
sober, O
the O
intimate O
decor B-TARGET
pleases. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
large, O
with O
a O
floor O
and O
a O
steep O
staircase. O

If O
booking O
specify O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
or O
floor O
to O
avoid O
surprises. O

We O
waited O
a O
little O
while O
for O
our O
order O
to O
be O
taken. O

At O
lunchtime, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
simple, O
you O
have O
the O
choice O
between O
3 O
entrees, O
3 O
main O
courses O
and O
3 O
deserts, O
except O
that O
at O
the O
choice O
of O
dessert B-TARGET
there O
was O
no O
choice O
but O
only O
one O
type O
of O
dessert. O

It's O
a O
little O
limited. O

Apparently O
the O
card O
has O
to O
change O
from O
time O
to O
time. O

I've O
chosen O
a O
favourite O
gratin O
at O
the O
entrance O
with O
a O
little O
salad B-TARGET
too O
seasoned. O

The O
fish, B-TARGET
a O
little O
hard, O
without O
too O
much O
flavor, O
and O
just O
quantity O
with O
a O
good O
presentation O

Service's B-TARGET
pretty O
fast. O

The O
fruit B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
dessert, O
correct. O

So, O
it's O
an O
ordinary O
restaurant, B-TARGET
which O
doesn't O
leave O
me O
with O
an O
imperishable O
memory. O

Excellent O
pizzas! B-TARGET

Well O
garnished, O
fresh O
products B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
they O
are O
not O
disgusting.. O

Very O
quickly O
:) O

At O
the O
hour O
of O
the O
aperitif O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
well O
located O
in O
the O
square O
cathedral. O

Nice O
decoration, B-TARGET
correct O
service. B-TARGET

Arriving O
meal O
time O
better O
change O
address. O

Cheap O
card B-TARGET
for O
quality, O
slow O
service, B-TARGET
warm O
dishes. B-TARGET

Too O
bad O
considering O
creative O
ideas. O

Refusing O

Unannounced O
Weekend! O

Scandalous O

Nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
grills. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
and O
helpful O
staff. B-TARGET

A O
good O
reference O
to O
Kourou. O

Too O
bad O
there's O
no O
terasse. O

It O
was O
my O
first O
lunch O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

the O
price O
is O
correct, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
well, O
the O
ambiance B-TARGET
nice O
though O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
products B-TARGET
very O
medium. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
I O
didn't O
taste O
pizza O
;-) O

Poor O
food. B-TARGET

High O
price O
for O
the O
service O
and O
especially O
sharpness O
leaves O
to O
be O
desired O
in O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
had O
lunch O
surrounded O
by O
flies O
in O
an O
air-conditioned O
room. O

When O
we O
made O
the O
observation O
to O
the O
server, B-TARGET
in O
response O
we O
were O
given O
a O
cynical O
remark. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
needs O
to O
get O
together O
soon. O

nice O
welcome, B-TARGET
nice O
setting. B-TARGET

We O
regularly O
have O
dinner O
in O
groups. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
very O
fresh, O
the O
copious O
portions, B-TARGET
the O
accompanying B-TARGET
sauces I-TARGET
and O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
are O
original O
and O
very O
good. O

A O
very O
good O
address, B-TARGET
in O
the O
genre O

Visiting O
the O
royal O
island, O
the O
main O
island O
of O
Salvation O
islands O
off O
Kourou, O
we O
took O
the O
opportunity O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
only O
restaurant O
on O
site. O

Even O
if O
the O
reception B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
courteous, O
the O
benefits O
suffer O
from O
the O
monopoly. O

Drinks B-TARGET
without O
flavor, O
restricted O
choices, O
we O
move O
to O
find O
a O
waiter, O
we O
wait O
for O
him O
to O
deign O
to O
take O
care O
of O
you... O
e.g.: O
a O
client O
is O
going O
to O
ask O
if O
we O
could O
do O
something O
for O
the O
insect O
in O
its O
dish, O
and O
well, O
no, O
he O
heard, O
it's O
not O
our O
fault, O
we O
can't O
do O
anything... O
exceptional O
service, B-TARGET
if O
we O
judge O
by O
this O
various O
fact! O

It O
would, O
however, O
be O
enough O
to O
make O
this O
place B-TARGET
an O
exceptional O
place O
because O
the O
site B-TARGET
is O
magical O
and O
full O
of O
history. O

We O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
on O
a O
Sunday O
night. O

We O
took O
the O
menu O
at O
€29.90. O

Entrance: O
Saint B-TARGET
Jacques I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
medium O
quality O
skewers. O

We O
don't O
change O
the O
cutlery... O

Flat: O
a O
piece B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
roasted I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
(not O
very O
tender), O
without O
sauce, O
with O
carrot B-TARGET
purée I-TARGET
(very O
good), O
broccoli O
and O
potatoes B-TARGET
not O
cooked O
in O
the O
middle. O

We O
made O
the O
remark O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
passed O
on O
to O
the O
cook. O

We O
heard O
the O
latter O
say O
from O
the O
kitchen O
that O
if O
we O
weren't O
happy O
we O
only O
had O
to O
eat O
them O
in O
mashed O
potatoes!... O

Dessert: O
Foam B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
2 I-TARGET
chocolates, I-TARGET
good O
but O
much O
too O
sweet. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
the O
toilets O
are O
not O
up O
to O
the O
level. O

The O
property O
also O
has O
a O
nice O
terrace. B-TARGET

In O
short, O
a O
cook B-TARGET
with O
a O
bad O
stomach, O
a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
may O
be O
organic O
but O
not O
gastronomic O
(you O
can O
eat O
organic O
without O
necessarily O
being O
on O
the O
diet...), O
all O
at O
too O
high O
a O
price. O

Frame B-TARGET
well O
but O
other O
than O
that??? O

a O
card B-TARGET
that O
starts O
at O
12th O
without O
salad, O
a O
fake B-TARGET
net I-TARGET
has O
25 O
served O
only O
with O
fries, O
and O
not O
a O
limousine O
meat!! O

Good O
surprise, O
the O
welcome B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
nice O
and O
smiled. O

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
well O
heated. O

The O

We O
come O
quite O
regularly O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
original O
and O
well O
presented O
but O
the O
owner O
being O
alone O
to O
serve O
it O
often O
happens O
that O
the O
dishes O
are O
lukewarm O
which O
is O
a O
pity. O

A O

A O
little O
meal O
with O
the O

Already O
visited O
a O
few O
years O
ago, O
but O
a O
very O
good O
memory O
that O
confirmed O
again! O

Nice O
room. B-TARGET

Fast O
and O
courteous O
service. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
great O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day, O
I O
choose O
to O
go O
home. O

I'll O
take O
the O
formula O
"day's O
entry O
- O
flat O
for O
€12.50." O

The O
entrance B-TARGET
is O
not O
good, O
no O
more O
dishes B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
day. O

It O
is O
replaced O
by O
another O
with O
my O
consent. O

The O
sauce O
invaded O
the O
fish. B-TARGET

No O
taste. O

The O
addition O
was O
no O
longer O
the O
same. O

I O
didn't O
say O
anything. O

Anyway, O
I'm O
not O
going O
back O
because O
I'm O
not O
good... O

8€50 O
for O
a O
Greek B-TARGET

without O
flavor: O
2 O
olives, O
a O
piece O
of O
tomato O
drowned O
in O
a O
salad O
bathed O
in O
oil. O

That's O
a O
good O
idea. O

I O
strongly O
advise O
against O
it. O

digestive O
problems O
after O
lunch! B-TARGET

I O
have O
renewed O
the O
experience O
several O
times O
but O
it's O
over O
I O
won't O
go O
anymore!!!!!!!! O

So O
here, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
classy O
restaurant, O
a O
very O
neat O
and O
refined O
kitchen B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
a O
birthday, O
or O
a O
great O
occasion, O
it's O
the O
IDEAL O
place! B-TARGET

Menus B-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices O
and O
very O
good O
cellar B-TARGET
with O
good O
advice. O

Thank O
you. O

The O
friends O
wanted O
to O
eat O
pancakes O
but... O
impossible O
to O
be O
accepted O
in O
those O
that O
had O
been O
recommended O
to O
us: O
we O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the O
tch'ti O
who O
are O
not O
specialists O
in O
pancakes O
and O
pancakes. O

Lovers O
of O
beer, O
cold O
fries O
and O
generous O
portions B-TARGET
you O
will O
be O
all O
the O
more O
delighted O
as O
the O
addition O
is O
light. O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
entered O
the O
establishment, B-TARGET
we O
felt O
a O
stress O
that O
hovered O
around O
the O
employees... O

At O
the O
same O
time O
no O
wonder: O
the O
boss B-TARGET
is O
as O
kind O
as O
a O
prison O
door... O

He O
directs O
his O
employees O
with O
finger-claps... O

Regarding O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
it O
was O
good O
but O
no O
more: O
pieces O
of O
fat O
in O
the O
chili, B-TARGET
cooking O
poorly O
controlled O
meats, B-TARGET
no O
almonds O
on O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
while O
he O
had O
to O
have O
some... O

The O
map, B-TARGET
however, O
is O
well-stocked O
and O
attractive. O

Oh, O
yes! O

I O
forgot O
a O
very O
noisy O
restaurant, O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
get O
along... O

the O
restaurant O
room B-TARGET
made O
canteen, O
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
sad, O
when O
at O
meal O
our O
entrecote B-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
tender, O

medium O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
I O
will O
avoid O
