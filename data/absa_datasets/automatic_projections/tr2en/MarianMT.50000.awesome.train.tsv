The B-TARGET
view I-TARGET
area, O
yes, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
sucks. O

When O
you O
ask O
for O
cold O
water, O
there's O
no O
cold, O
the O
waiter O
who O
says O
we're O
out O
of O
all O
the O
water, O
the O
food O
that O
comes O
in O
exactly O
two O
hours O
after O
the O
order, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
meal B-TARGET
is O
no O
more O
than O
a O
piece O
of O
roca O
and O
pure O
that O
we O
want O
to O
eat. O

The O
food's B-TARGET
good, O
the O
flavors B-TARGET
are O
good, O
but O
there's O
nothing O
exciting O
about O
it, O
it's O
no O
longer O
a O
horse O
and O
camel O
thing O
to O
do O
with O
a O
good O
fish. O

These O
prices B-TARGET
are O
too O
big O
for O
this O
service. O

I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
low O
quality B-TARGET
of O
blue. O

I O
don't O
know O
where O
to O
start. O

I O
mean, O
people O
who O
make O
such O
good O
comments O
here, O
they've O
probably O
never O
eaten O
fish B-TARGET
before. O

Before O
the O
calamari O
and O
Coke, O
the O
fish B-TARGET
came I-TARGET
and O
was O
thrown O
right O
in O
front O
of O
us. O

Besides, O
the O
squid B-TARGET
was O
cold O
and O
sponge-like. O

Long O
story O
short, O
I'll O
never, O
ever O
go O
back O
and O
recommend O
it. O

As O
I O
told O
you O
before, O
it's O
a O
low-profile B-TARGET
place. O

It's O
definitely O
not O
a O
home-cooked B-TARGET
meal I-TARGET
- O
although O
there O
are O
so O
many O
failed O
home-cooked O
meals, O
I O
haven't O
been O
able O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
intensity O
of O
the O
afternoon. O

People O
don't O
really O
know O
what O
a O
home-cooked B-TARGET
meal I-TARGET
is. O

Or O
everyone O
tries O
once O
like O
me O
and O
never O
leaves. O

I'm O
not O
suggesting O
a O
place O
where O
the O
prices B-TARGET
I've O
tried O
once O
are B-TARGET
high O
and O
the O
food O
is O
tasteless. O

At O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
place, O
I O
found O
the O
butcher's B-TARGET
department I-TARGET
not O
very O
intimate, O
since O
there O
was O
no O
bright, O
warm O
landscape O
to O
be O
created. O

Our O
waiter O
was O
indifferent, O
so O
we O
said O
he O
did, O
which O
weakens O
my O
expectations O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

I O
ate O
better O
marshmallows. B-TARGET
It O
was O
nice. O

It's O
a O
chassis O
salad, O
so... O

I O
don't O
know, O
maybe O
I O
could O
give O
the O
place B-TARGET
another O
chance O
later. O

Two O
years O
ago, O
I O
remembered O
the O
place O
we O
came O
to O
have O
a O
quick O
breakfast O
with O
six O
tl O
tea: B-TARGET

We O
didn't O
pay O
attention O
on O
the O
menu, O
but O
we O
had O
a O
little O
shock O
when O
the O
check O
came O
in, O
which O
may O
have O
been O
nice, O
but O
we O
didn't O
stop O
by O
again O
because O
of O
the O
month B-TARGET
we O
paid O
more O
than O
breakfast. O

I'd O
recommend O
castle B-TARGET
beer. I-TARGET

The B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
is O
buttered O
and O
soft. O

It O
was O
delicious O
for O
those O
who O
didn't O
like O
hard O
meat. O

It's O
a O
good O
three-way O
with O
safe O
yoghurt B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
salad. I-TARGET

He's B-TARGET
got O
a O
quick O
valet. O

In O
the O
open, O
the O
gardenia B-TARGET
is O
good. O

Perfect O
for O
a O
crowd. O

He's O
got O
coffee O
and O
bongs O
on O
his O
side. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
things, O
it's O
confusing. O

Today O
we O
drank O
bourbon B-TARGET
vanilla I-TARGET
out O
of O
black O
tea O
with O
a O
working O
friend. O

The O
vanilla O
tasted O
really O
good, O
but O
I O
liked O
the B-TARGET
white I-TARGET
tea O
better. O

It's B-TARGET
not O
the O
place O
I'd O
rather O
be, O
especially O
because O
I'm O
a O
coffee-loving O
person, O
but O
it O
might O
be O
good O
for O
a O
change O
sometimes. O

I O
wouldn't O
advise O
you O
to O
leave B-TARGET
when I-TARGET
you're I-TARGET
busy. O

The O
flavor O
is O
changing... O

The O
pendik B-TARGET
main I-TARGET
branch I-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
in O
the O
department. O

It's O
the O
most O
delicious O
raisin B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
eaten O
outside. O

On O
the O
advice O
of O
a O
friend, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Central O
Village O
branch. O

His B-TARGET
beans I-TARGET
are O
falling O
out O
of O
his O
mouth, O
like O
marshmallows. O

From O
what O
I O
hear, O
they B-TARGET
don't I-TARGET
keep I-TARGET
it O
in O
water, O
they O
keep O
it O
in O
milk. O

It's O
great O
with O
pickles O
and O
coochie O
and B-TARGET
yogurt. I-TARGET

And O
the O
rice B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
it O
smells B-TARGET
like O
sweet O
butter. O

I O
suggest O
you O
do O
the O
final O
with B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
pudding. I-TARGET

And O
the B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
pudding I-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

We're O
not O
used O
to O
sitting O
at O
the O
Hard O
Rock O
Cafe O
waiting O
in O
line, O
which O
is O
why O
we O
don't O
feel O
the O
same O
way O
about O
Europe O
or O
America, O
but O
the O
flavor B-TARGET
is O
the O
same. O

Jumbo B-TARGET
Combo's I-TARGET
not O
too O
soft O
for O
snacks! O

The O
seafood B-TARGET
is O
very O
successful. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
already O
perfect. O

You B-TARGET
feel I-TARGET
the O
beauty, O
the O
intensity O
of O
all O
the O
landbul. O

Other O
than O
that, O
it's O
not O
exactly O
a O
student B-TARGET
place. I-TARGET

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
on O
special O
occasions, O
a O
place O
to O
celebrate. O

If O
you O
want O
to B-TARGET
chat I-TARGET
freely, I-TARGET
it's O
perfect. O

The B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
is O
just O
right, O
it O
doesn't O
bother O
me. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
view B-TARGET
is O
perfect. O

But O
the B-TARGET
account I-TARGET
seems O
a O
bit O
excessive, O
we O
paid O
more O
than O
$100 O
per O
person O
without O
eating O
fish, O
which O
should O
be O
contested. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
service B-TARGET
going O
on O
in O
the O
crowd. O

No O
matter O
how O
fast O
the O
pasta O
I O
said O
it O
was, O
the O
place O
filled O
up O
and O
the O
order O
my O
friend O
ordered O
was B-TARGET
forgotten, O
we O
had O
to O
do O
it O
over O
and O
over O
again. O

Besides, O
the O
fact O
that B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
tables I-TARGET
are O
too O
much O
to O
drink O
can O
make O
you O
uncomfortable O
from O
time O
to O
time. O

In O
winter, O
you O
can O
eat O
good O
food B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
a O
warm, O
dim O
light O
environment, O
and O
in O
summer, O
you O
can O
taste O
that O
wonderful B-TARGET
strawberry I-TARGET
magnolia I-TARGET
outside. O

It's O
a O
delicious O
taste B-TARGET
to O
cool O
your O
heart. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
grumpy. O

He O
doesn't O
deserve O
to O
be O
praised O
so O
much. O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
the O
meatloaf I-TARGET
doesn't O
have O
a O
cap O
in O
it O
and O
the O
meatloaf O
master O
gets O
by. O

Description: O

They O
say O
they're O
making O
meatloaf O
out O
of O
cashews. O

The O
wet B-TARGET
guy's I-TARGET
rude. O

That's O
just O
what O
our O
meatloaf B-TARGET
guy O
says! O

The B-TARGET
customer's I-TARGET
satisfaction I-TARGET
is O
zero! O

The O
Sampi O
of O
the O
years O
is O
where O
I O
choose O
to O
order O
home O
when O
I O
feel O
like O
it. O

Then O
I O
wish O
it O
wasn't O
on O
the O
menu O
for O
starters! O

With O
Beşiktaş O
right O
behind O
the O
bus O
stops, O
the O
transportation B-TARGET
is O
very O
easy O
and O
of O
course O
the O
prices B-TARGET
are O
very O
reasonable. O

It's O
the O
first O
time O
I've O
ever O
been O
to O
a O
branch O
and O
had O
a O
meal. O

I'm O
one O
of O
those O
crispy O
pita B-TARGET
people, O
so O
I O
specifically O
asked O
him O
to O
order O
it, O
and O
he O
really O
did O
come O
to O
the O
cheetah O
pie. O

But O
unfortunately, O
my O
friends O
I O
went O
with O
didn't O
like O
the O
crispy O
pita, O
and O
of O
course, O
theirs O
were O
crispy. O

Yes, O
I O
am! O

I'm O
being O
pulled O
into O
my O
corner O
on O
one O
foot! O

Anyway, O
it O
tasted O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
a O
delivery O
service, O
so O
you O
can O
eat O
without O
waiting. O

He's B-TARGET
got O
plenty O
of O
stuff, O
and O
he's O
got O
a O
full O
serving. O

We O
wanted O
to O
order O
Lahmacun O
for O
starters, O
but O
the O
waiter O
said O
that O
Lahmacun O
lasted O
longer O
than O
Pide, O
because O
the O
dough O
was O
fresh. O

In B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
middle I-TARGET
of O
Beşiktaş. O

Someone O
who's O
never O
been O
to O
another O
branch, O
who's O
not O
really O
a O
muffin O
nut. O

And O
I'm O
afraid O
the B-TARGET
experience I-TARGET
wasn't O
very O
positive. O

Well, O
I O
don't O
mean O
to O
be O
delicious, B-TARGET
but O
he's O
got O
the O
wrong O
idea O
that O
when O
we O
order, O
a O
friend O
of O
ours O
wants O
his O
crusts O
crispy, B-TARGET
so O
he's O
got O
all O
the O
orders O
crispy. O

I O
couldn't O
eat O
the B-TARGET
edges I-TARGET
because O
I O
didn't O
like O
them, O
but O
the O
middle B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

For O
starters, O
of O
course, O
it O
was O
one O
thing O
to O
have O
the O
lamau O
on O
the O
menu O
later O
than O
the O
main O
food O
pit. O

If O
you O
don't O
have O
much O
time O
to O
eat, O
let's O
not O
blow O
the B-TARGET
budget, I-TARGET
we O
don't O
have O
to O
eat O
too O
much O
fun, O
as O
long O
as O
Sampi's O
in O
the O
mall O
for O
those O
who O
think O
we O
should O
be O
fed. O

Service: O

Four O
Prices: O

5 O
Location: O

8 O
Tastes: O

Four O
hot O
drinks B-TARGET
are O
heavy, O
preferable O
for O
breakfast, B-TARGET
but O
the O
price B-TARGET
is O
high O
on O
flavor. O

Surely O
there's O
a O
spectacular O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
how O
a O
good O
rum O
bar O
dinner I-TARGET
was O
successful O
a O
week O
ago, O
and O
the O
biggest O
thing O
about O
this O
place O
is O
that O
they're O
always O
serving O
it, O
although O
it's O
expensive, O
but O
it O
deserves O
it. O

It's O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places B-TARGET
where O
I've O
gone O
to O
try O
grilled O
mushrooms O
and O
lobster I-TARGET
roasting I-TARGET
and O
I've O
never O
regretted O
it. O

It O
looks O
a O
lot O
like O
the O
Greek O
and O
Armenian O
kitchen O
with O
the O
fish O
in O
the O
appetizers. B-TARGET

The O
kushonmaz B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
wrap, O
the O
fish B-TARGET
bacon I-TARGET
in O
the O
paper O
must O
definitely O
be O
tried. O

The O
tea's B-TARGET
great O
here! O

Bourbon O
Vanilla O
number O
34 O
tea. O

It's O
a O
great O
flavor O
you O
can't O
get O
enough O
of O
with O
Vanilla O
and O
the O
orange O
flavor. O

It's B-TARGET
nice O
to O
have O
a O
chat, O
but O
if O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
view, B-TARGET
you'll O
have O
to O
go O
somewhere O
else. O

You O
should O
visit O
this O
place O
where O
you O
can O
find O
exactly O
60 O
different O
kinds O
of O
tea! B-TARGET

It's O
a O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
I O
love O
to O
go, O
and O
I'm O
always O
happy O
to O
leave. O

I O
especially O
recommend O
going O
in O
the O
evenings, O
when O
the B-TARGET
bridge I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
fort O
lights O
are O
on, O
it O
has O
a O
different O
taste. O

With O
live B-TARGET
music: I-TARGET

It O
gets O
better. O

This O
place O
is O
not O
as O
legendary O
as O
they O
say O
it O
is. O

It's B-TARGET
oily, I-TARGET
it O
smells, O
it's O
thin, O
and O
the O
worst O
of O
it O
is O
that O
it's O
three O
hours O
past, O
and O
I'm O
sick O
of O
it. O

I O
don't O
like O
the O
atmosphere, O
but O
it's O
a O
class O
3. O

I O
won't O
go O
again. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
delicious, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
flashy. O

But O
the B-TARGET
presentation I-TARGET
is O
officially O
zero. O

I O
think O
you O
can O
go O
beyond O
just O
putting O
it O
on O
a O
flat O
white O
plate B-TARGET
for O
a O
hamburger O
you O
got O
30 O
tls? O

And O
the O
carrot B-TARGET
slice I-TARGET
is O
overfat O
and O
sherbet. O

There's O
nothing O
very O
creative O
about O
it. O

Big O
Chef O
who O
doesn't O
serve B-TARGET
out O
of O
breakfast O
till O
2:30 O
on O
Sunday! O

We O
went O
out O
for O
coffee O
after O
breakfast, O
and O
we O
came O
back O
from O
the O
door, O
and O
it O
was O
1:30, O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
joke, O
and... O

Big B-TARGET
Chefs, I-TARGET
you're O
a O
chain... O

We O
thought O
we'd O
go O
here, O
bored O
out O
of O
the O
major O
shopping O
centers O
on O
the O
level. O

That O
was O
the O
name O
of O
my O
cofte O
friend, O
the O
chicken O
WRAP////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
menu O
had O
been O
written, O
our O
chicken B-TARGET
WRAP I-TARGET
didn't O
come O
with O
potatoes, O
so O
we O
asked O
them O
why O
they O
had O
removed O
the O
potato, O
and O
they O
said O
they O
hadn't O
changed O
their O
menu O
yet. O

Five O
minutes O
after O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
chicken O
Wrapten, O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
fog O
burrito O
came O
in, O
and O
they O
changed O
the O
situation. O

The B-TARGET
chickens I-TARGET
were O
dry, O
the O
coft B-TARGET
was O
ordinary. O

When O
both O
of O
the O
greens O
were O
put O
in O
for O
silence O
and O
we O
tried O
to O
eat, O
we O
had O
a O
bitter O
taste. B-TARGET

We O
told O
him O
about O
the O
olive B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
with O
beans, O
barbunia, O
pepper O
fillings, O
wraps O
and O
cocksuckers O
in O
it. O

They've O
had O
a O
good O
taste, O
but O
they've O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
putting O
it O
in. O

Prices B-TARGET
are O
normal, O
service B-TARGET
is O
slow, O
toilets B-TARGET
are O
dirty. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
was O
beautiful O
was B-TARGET
the O
view, O
yes, O
the O
children's B-TARGET
playground, O
and O
there's O
a O
lady B-TARGET
who's O
got O
a O
face O
like O
that, O
who's O
got O
a O
face O
like O
that, O
who's O
got O
a O

like O

who's O
got O
a O

who's O

like O
that, O
and O
I'm O
sitting O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
table O
where O
I'm O
sitting. O

Open O
bar O
breakfast, O
yeah, O
it O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
breakfast, O
but O
the O
presentation B-TARGET
didn't O
satisfy O
me, O
it O
didn't O
give O
me O
a O
sense O
of O
hygiene. O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
- O
the O
place O
has O
been O
in O
Tuzla O
for O
about O
three O
or O
four O
months. O

It's O
one O
of O
the O
good O
places B-TARGET
to O
go. O

The O
first O
month O
it O
opened, O
we O
were O
very O
pleased O
to O
go, O
but O
later O
on, O
we O
observed O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
had O
been O
very O
awkward O
and O
that O
the O
waiters O
couldn't O
take O
care O
of O
everyone O
because O
of O
their B-TARGET
intensity. O

Few O
waiters B-TARGET
work, O
and O
sometimes O
when O
the O
place O
is O
full, O
they O
can't O
afford O
it. O

They O
don't O
have O
a O
menu O
as O
large O
as O
the O
other O
Mado O
subs. O

Classic O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
specials I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
desserts. I-TARGET

It O
was B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
place I-TARGET
where O
I O
went O
online, O
but O
unfortunately O
it O
didn't O
meet O
my O
expectations O
very O
well. O

I'm O
afraid O
waiters B-TARGET
don't O
bring O
you O
what O
you O
ask O
for O
at O
least O
twice. O

It O
wasn't O
as O
beautiful O
as O
it O
looked B-TARGET
on O
the O
Internet. O

I O
had O
breakfast O
with O
that O
burrito O
today. O

The O
burrito B-TARGET
was O
quite O
delicious. O

Was B-TARGET
the O
tea O
bad? O

No, O
it O
was O
fresh O
and O
delicious. O

It O
was O
more O
than O
expected. O

It's O
ideal O
in O
every O
way O
-- O
it's O
a O
place O
where O
we O
go O
so O
fucking O
close O
to O
school, O
and O
it's O
great. O

There's O
weddings O
and O
stuff. O

But O
I O
know O
he O
doesn't O
have O
lodgings. O

It's O
more O
fun O
to O
have O
summer O
sitting O
in O
front O
of B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
view. I-TARGET

There's O
a O
discount B-TARGET
app O
on O
the O
marmara O
students, O
too. O

That's O
why O
he's O
taking O
advantage O
of O
us. O

There O
are O
aunts O
who O
make O
waffles O
this O
year, O
and O
they've O
started O
serving O
baked O
potato. O

And O
her O
hairdresser B-TARGET
is O
very O
cheap O
and O
very O
good. O

That's O
all O
there O
is O
to O
it. O

It's O
a O
beautiful O
view, B-TARGET
but O
the B-TARGET
kitchen O
isn't O
enough O
for O
the O
price O
performance. O

I O
blame O
it O
on O
advertising O
that O
it's O
so O
famous O
because O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
places O
in O
Istanbul O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
better O
seafood B-TARGET
at O
better O
prices. B-TARGET

If O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
money, O
try O
it, O
but O
you O
don't O
have O
to: O

It's B-TARGET
a O
nice O
round O
arrow, O
but O
it's O
getting O
more O
and O
more O
crowded, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
eat O
in O
a O
terrible O
noise, O
without O
moving O
your O
arms O
shoulder O
to O
shoulder O
at O
the B-TARGET
restaurant. I-TARGET

It's O
a O
warm O
environment B-TARGET
-- O
it's B-TARGET
not O
a O
good O
place, O
but O
it's O
a O
pleasant, O
colorful O
place, O
with O
taste O
and O
presentation O
of O
food. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
terrible O
thing O
to O
wait O
for. O

It's O
not O
a O
place B-TARGET
for O
people O
who O
don't O
like O
pain. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
great, O
it's B-TARGET
nice, O
but O
if O
a O
complicated B-TARGET
meatball I-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
comes O
with O
meatballs, O
fajita B-TARGET
hurts, O
it's O
not O
for O
me. O

Just O
eat B-TARGET
the O
appetizers. I-TARGET

We O
try O
to O
come O
every O
week. O

They O
cook O
all O
the O
fish O
with B-TARGET
different I-TARGET
sauces, I-TARGET
and O
the O
appetizers O
keep O
coming O
until O
you O
tell O
them O
to O
stop. O

My O
record O
is O
9 O
appetizers! O

Where O
the O
fish O
is O
eaten O
like O
fast O
food. O

I O
wouldn't O
recommend O
it O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
enjoy O
yourself O
slowly. O

The O
service O
is O
too O
fast. B-TARGET

And O
I O
love O
cornbread B-TARGET
so O
hot. O

60 O
kinds B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tea, O
soul-relieving O
music, B-TARGET
pleasant O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
disappointing O
Mizuno B-TARGET
Pudding, I-TARGET
and O
although O
different, O
I O
had O
only O
had O
tea, O
which O
is O
what O
makes O
me O
think O
now: O

) O
That's O
what O
happened O
in O
Dem... O

I O
enjoyed O
it O
a O
lot, O
and O
I O
said O
it O
wasn't O
worth O
that O
much O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
tea, O
and O
I O
didn't O
like O
Mizuno B-TARGET
Pudding I-TARGET
that O
wasn't O
praised. O

It's O
one O
of O
those O
places O
where O
we've O
heard O
so O
much O
about O
their O
pizza O
and O
we O
can't O
go... O

I O
said, O
why O
haven't O
I O
been O
here O
yet? O

And O
we're O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

We O
left O
early, O
but O
it's O
an O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
at O
night... O

It's O
impossible O
to O
get O
rid O
of B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
crowd I-TARGET
whenever O
the O
day O
goes O
by. O

The O
group O
of O
housewives B-TARGET
who O
raise O
the O
child O
reduces O
interest O
in O
the O
place. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
fine. O

The O
taste O
of O
products O
is O
the O
same O
as O
any O
other O
wet O
nurse. O

Not O
when O
you O
want O
to O
bring O
in O
the O
encyclopaedia O
and O
give O
your O
order, O
not O
when O
you O
want O
to O
bring O
in O
the O
menu, O
not O
when O
you O
have O
no O
more O
uok, O
no O
more O
water, O
but O
in O
terms O
of O
statements O
that O
you O
can't O
eat O
the O
dessert O
you O
want, O
when O
you O
give O
it O
to O
the O
local O
operator, O
they O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it, O
and O
they O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it, O
and O
they O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it, O
and O
they O
have O
no O
idea O
that O
their O
waiters O
are O
selling O
it. O

I O
certainly O
don't O
recommend O
it. O

I O
think O
it's O
really O
overrated, O
Eleos, B-TARGET
that O
we've O
always O
come O
up O
with O
specific O
reasons O
after O
the O
mythic O
stories O
of O
the O
other O
branch. O

I O
don't O
know O
about O
the O
Greenville O
branch, O
but O
this O
place O
is O
above O
standard, O
but O
I O
think O
those O
prices B-TARGET
are O
ridiculous. O

They've O
also O
normalized O
the O
most O
annoying O
app, O
like O
a O
fix B-TARGET
menu O
push. O

And O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
are O
above O
average. O

And O
the O
balcony/teras B-TARGET
section I-TARGET
is O
really O
small. O

Still, O
it's O
more O
preferable O
than O
the O
taverns O
in O
the O
Asmamescit O
area. O

This O
place B-TARGET
I've O
always O
been O
going O
to, O
and O
it's O
always O
been O
disgusting, O
and O
now O
it's O
really O
getting O
on O
your O
nerves. O

It's O
the O
place's B-TARGET
manager, I-TARGET
the O
way O
he O
talks O
about O
brain O
demeanor, B-TARGET
that's O
the O
way O
he O
talks, O
and O
that's O
the O
way O
he O
behaves. O

I O
think O
the B-TARGET
popularity O
of O
the O
place O
will O
relax O
them, O
but O
with O
that O
relief, O
they'll O
lose O
popularity O
in O
a O
short O
amount O
of O
time. O

It's O
not O
the O
only O
place O
in O
Istanbul O
that O
has O
a O
view, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
very O
tasteless O
in B-TARGET
its I-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

After O
all, O
I'm O
not O
stepping O
foot O
in O
this O
place O
with B-TARGET
that I-TARGET
operator I-TARGET
at O
the O
sultan's O
table O
again. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
it's O
very O
crowded O
at B-TARGET
lunch, O
but O
it's O
comfortable O
after O
2:00. O

You O
can O
order O
five O
different O
types O
of O
food, O
especially O
Bugday B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and O
carrot B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
if O
you O
like. O

The O
address O
of B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
baklava I-TARGET
in O
Istanbul. O

You O
should O
stop O
by O
the O
box O
when O
you O
pass O
by O
Emin. O

It's O
not O
just O
baklava. O
It's O
a B-TARGET
mixed I-TARGET
plate. I-TARGET

I O
especially O
recommend O
chocolate O
baklava B-TARGET
to O
the O
ladies. O

By O
pleasing O
my O
guests O
from O
home, O
by B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
view I-TARGET
and, O
of O
course, O
by O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
meals, I-TARGET
I've O
earned O
my O
love. O

I O
really O
like O
it B-TARGET
here. I-TARGET

If O
you O
say O
it O
in O
the O
middle, O
you O
can O
taste O
anything. O

Everything B-TARGET
is O
so O
close O
to O
its O
delicious O
status. O

Make O
sure O
you B-TARGET
have I-TARGET
a O
good O
time. O

The O
place O
that O
doesn't O
want O
you O
to O
drink O
anything O
but O
beer, O
beer O
is O
$7.8, O
vodka B-TARGET
is O
25, O
wine B-TARGET
is O
17.5... O

Other O
than O
that, O
after O
a O
certain O
hour, O
music B-TARGET
reaches O
a O
deafening O
level. O

He's O
more O
of O
a O
non-alcoholic O
fisherman O
than O
his O
fish. O

The O
appetizers B-TARGET
are O
really O
over-standard, O
almost O
every O
day O
during O
the O
evening O
hours. O

Other O
than O
that, O
the O
employee's B-TARGET
interest I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
also O
very O
good. O

What O
a O
disappointment. O

We O
went O
with O
dreams O
of O
a O
combo O
plate, O
and O
a O
very O
tasteless O
plate B-TARGET
with O
two O
or O
three O
pieces O
in O
it, O
like O
a O
joke. O

The O
burgers B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
mediocre. O

Very, O
very O
bad. O

We O
just O
wanted O
to O
have O
breakfast B-TARGET
and O
regret O
it. O

They're B-TARGET
very O
small O
prices. B-TARGET
They're I-TARGET
very O
expensive. O

Waiters B-TARGET
don't O
have O
good O
teas. B-TARGET

You O
know, O
maybe O
we O
could O
go O
for O
dessert B-TARGET
once O
in O
a O
while. O

That's O
for O
the O
view. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
place O
you O
should O
stop O
if O
you O
like O
exotic O
tea. B-TARGET

Bourbon B-TARGET
vanilla I-TARGET
and O
Irish B-TARGET
Malt I-TARGET
between O
the O
teas O
I O
recommended. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quality, O
and O
the O
employees B-TARGET
are O
incredibly O
interested. O

You O
can O
also O
buy O
some O
of O
your O
favorite O
teas B-TARGET
as O
a O
package. O

And O
the O
music B-TARGET
choices I-TARGET
at O
the O
place O
are O
great. O

Sometimes O
it O
can O
be O
incredibly O
crowded, O
and O
on O
days O
like O
this, O
there O
are O
faults O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
spacious. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
too O
fast. O

There's O
so O
many O
different O
kinds. B-TARGET

Some O
species B-TARGET
can O
be O
very O
unrelated O
to O
kebabs. O

Prices B-TARGET
are O
reasonable. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
delicious. O

The B-TARGET
view I-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
terrible. O

We O
wanted O
a O
pot O
of O
tea B-TARGET
once, O
and O
it O
smelled O
like O
mold O
made O
with O
tap O
water. O

Then O
they O
changed O
it O
and O
made O
it O
with O
checkers O
water. O

In O
short, O
it O
sucks. O

We O
went O
to O
shura O
with O
friends. O

The O
buffet O
was O
open. O

The O
place O
is O
beautiful, O
the O
shapes B-TARGET
are O
unbelievably O
rich O
and O
delicious. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
fine. O

The B-TARGET
facility I-TARGET
is O
located O
in O
the O
Fethi O
Pasa O
grove. O

Meat B-TARGET
quality O
is O
average. O

Taste B-TARGET
is O
average. O

I'd O
like O
to O
know O
what O
you're O
very O
popular O
with. O

It's B-TARGET
a O
nice O
place. O

This O
meat B-TARGET
never O
deserves O
this O
money. O

I O
don't O
know O
how O
or O
why, O
but O
they O
say O
the O
meat O
is O
more O
delicious O
in O
Floria O
Square. O

I'm O
gonna O
go O
over O
there O
and O
taste O
it. O

You O
go O
for O
the B-TARGET
beans. I-TARGET

They're O
doing O
good. O

Rice O
is O
a O
good O
menu B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
buttermilk. I-TARGET

But O
I'm O
not O
happy O
with O
your O
staff B-TARGET
about O
the O
service, O
so O
get O
on O
with O
it. O

changes O

The O
last O
day O
of O
March O
was O
a O
terrible O
day. O

The B-TARGET
breakfasts I-TARGET
came O
and O
the O
tea O
was O
gone, O
and O
I O
couldn't O
beat O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
rotten B-TARGET
tomato, I-TARGET
and O
we O
kept O
asking O
for O
it O
at O
the O
next O
table, O
and O
he O
kept O
saying, O
"We O
didn't O
come." O

It O
was O
a O
breakfaster O
I O
used O
to O
love. O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
I'm O
eating. O

Wherever O
we O
go, O
the O
log O
house B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
the O
place O
that O
saves O
us O
when O
we're O
about O
to O
be O
indecisive. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
relatively O
fast, O
the O
prices B-TARGET
are O
not O
expensive, O
and O
the B-TARGET
garden O
is O
beautiful. O

It's O
more O
preferable O
in O
winter, O
but O
you O
can O
go O
in O
the O
summer. O

Thanks O
to O
their O
taste B-TARGET
and O
interest, B-TARGET
the B-TARGET
Little I-TARGET
House I-TARGET
gave O
us O
a O
pleasant O
evening. O

And O
the O
one O
thing O
I O
like O
most O
about O
it O
is O
that O
it's O
back. B-TARGET

It O
was O
delicious. O

I O
suggest O
that O
if O
you're O
ever O
in O
the O
way O
here, O
you O
try O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
get O
back O
and B-TARGET
try I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
roast I-TARGET
pita. I-TARGET

I O
like O
the O
other O
foods, B-TARGET
they're O
all O
good. O

You O
might O
want O
to O
try O
their O
own O
buffalo B-TARGET
yoghurt. I-TARGET

I O
like O
the O
sweets O
the O
best O
and O
the O
creamy B-TARGET
sweets. I-TARGET

Prices B-TARGET
are O
considered O
appropriate O
because O
of B-TARGET
the O
quality O
and O
central O
position O
of O
the O
service I-TARGET
offered. O

You O
can O
see O
the O
menu O
content O
in O
the O
last O
picture. O

First O
of O
all, O
I O
really O
like O
the O
vibe. B-TARGET

It's O
nice, O
it's O
got O
dicks O
and O
it's O
got O
plenty O
of O
room. B-TARGET

I O
especially O
liked O
the O
tree B-TARGET
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

I O
don't O
think O
it O
should O
ever O
be O
cut. O

Your O
efforts O
to O
protect O
that O
tree O
will O
certainly O
increase O
your O
respectability. O

It's O
more O
local O
than O
ready O
products, O
and O
I O
like O
the O
way O
they O
use O
their O
own O
products. B-TARGET

I've O
been O
taken O
from O
me O
by O
shellfish O
and O
roasting O
from O
Tripoli O
and O
Rize. O

It O
was O
great... O

I O
ate O
what O
I O
didn't O
expect O
- O
my O
friends O
praised O
me O
so O
much, O
I O
came O
and O
ate O
it. O

I O
mean, O
it O
wasn't O
good. O

The O
palate O
didn't O
appeal O
to O
my O
taste. O

The O
peppers B-TARGET
were O
thrown O
into O
it O
before O
it O
was O
fried. O

Lots O
of O
eggs O
and O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
tomatoes B-TARGET
in O
it. O

It's O
not O
like O
I've O
had O
a O
pepper O
omelet. O

The B-TARGET
buttermilk I-TARGET
wasn't O
bad. O

I O
kind O
of O
like O
it. O

He O
doesn't O
have O
any O
food B-TARGET
to O
experience O
outside O
the O
view, I-TARGET
it's O
unnecessary, O
it's O
expensive, O
and O
it's O
never O
worth O
the O
money O
you're O
giving O
him, O
because O
it O
doesn't O
actually O
exist. O

We O
thought O
we'd O
try O
the O
hamburger, B-TARGET
which O
is O
the O
35tl O
lousy O
hamburger, O
which O
is O
not O
delicious, O
but O
the O
saogans O
are O
not O
caramelized, O
but O
the O
potato B-TARGET
fries O
are O
good, O
so O
eat O
it O
at O
mc O
donaldsta. O

That's O
where B-TARGET
I O
got O
a O
chance O
to O
go O
and O
have O
breakfast O
again O
yesterday. O

We O
ordered O
an O
extra O
basket O
of O
potatoes O
and O
a O
cowman O
for O
two O
people O
on O
a O
breakfast O
plate. O

I'm O
a O
friend O
and O
my O
2.5-year-old O
son, O
and O
we're O
satisfied O
with O
comfort. O

The O
tea B-TARGET
with O
a O
breakfast O
dish O
was O
free. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
table O
upstairs, O
we O
paid O
42 O
tl, B-TARGET
including O
three O
cups O
of O
tea O
and O
water. O

Breakfast O
plate B-TARGET
17.90 O
tl O
menemen B-TARGET
10 O
tl O
potato B-TARGET
8 O
tl. O

Sani B-TARGET
is O
scattered O
all O
over O
Istanbul. O

But O
even O
though O
he's O
so O
close O
to O
me, O
I'd O
rather O
not O
go O
too O
fucking O
far. O

Thank O
you B-TARGET
for O
your O
meat, O
but O
they're O
crazy O
about O
the O
price. B-TARGET

I'm O
sure O
they'll O
attract O
more O
customers B-TARGET
if O
they O
turn O
it O
into O
a O
fucking O
mess. O

It's O
nice O
to O
find O
so O
many O
and O
so O
many O
delicious O
teas B-TARGET
together. O

He O
drags O
you O
into O
a O
different O
atmosphere B-TARGET
with O
the O
tables O
he O
put O
on O
the O
street O
in I-TARGET
the O
narrow O
alley. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
thorough O
and O
beautiful. O

His O
client B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
a O
young O
crowd. O

The O
fact O
that O
the B-TARGET
ashtrays I-TARGET
are O
full O
and O
dirty O
reminds O
me O
of O
Starbucks. O

To B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
View, I-TARGET
of O
course, O
the O
Star O
Five! O

Decoration B-TARGET
is O
just O
as O
good. O

If O
you're O
patient O
and O
you O
want O
to O
be O
a O
little O
closer O
to O
the O
sea, O
good O
luck O
is O
a O
mystery O
how O
long O
you'll O
wait. O

That O
might O
be O
the O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
this O
place. O

Prices B-TARGET
are O
really O
one O
click O
higher, O
but O
the O
view B-TARGET
blinds O
me O
every O
time O
and O
I O
can O
ignore O
them. O

Love B-TARGET
Memnu's I-TARGET
got O
a O
taste O
for O
it! O

If O
you're O
here, O
make O
sure O
you O
try O
it. O
Birdhouse B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
hard O
to O
beat, O
but O
that's O
a O
good O
alternative. O

It's O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
place B-TARGET
outside O
in O
the O
summer. O

But O
the O
fry B-TARGET
combo I-TARGET
is O
great. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
slow O
because O
of O
the O
constant O
crowd. O

Sometimes O
it O
takes O
half O
an O
hour O
for O
an O
account B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
arrive. I-TARGET

That's O
all O
there O
is O
to O
fame. O

Pretend O
you're O
not O
taking O
it O
with O
your O
money. O
The O
concept B-TARGET
of O
the O
father O
is O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
young O
man. O

Three O
friends O
went O
in O
early O
in O
the O
summer, O
sat O
on O
the O
turnstile, O
no O
one O
came O
in O
to O
order O
for O
seven O
or O
eight O
minutes. O

There O
was O
a O
staff O
cleaning O
the O
tables, O
we O
asked O
if O
you'd O
look, O
but O
I O
didn't. O

Wait O
a O
minute, O
I've O
got O
work O
to O
do. O
You O
see, O
it's O
kind O
of O
a O
brush. O

Yeah, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
it O
was O
because O
we O
left O
for O
the O
weekend. O

The O
workers O
weren't O
very O
interested, O
even O
though O
we O
told O
17482 O
waiters B-TARGET
half O
an O
hour O
later. O

It's O
a O
little O
underprivileged O
in O
the O
variety B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beverages, I-TARGET
but O
it's O
very, O
very O
cheap O
in O
price-free B-TARGET
environment. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
get O
hot O
and O
cool O
around O
here, O
you O
can O
sit O
at O
one O
of O
the O
tables O
by O
the O
throat O
and O
drink O
something O
cold O
with O
live O
music. O

Turkish B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
isn't O
bad O
either. O

The O
view B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
design I-TARGET
are O
beautiful, O
but O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
indifferent, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
small O
and O
expensive. O

It's O
a O
place O
for O
Arab O
tourists. O

It's B-TARGET
delicious. I-TARGET

There's O
nothing O
out O
there O
except O
for O
the O
view. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
dead O
end O
for O
a O
happy B-TARGET
hour. I-TARGET

I O
think O
burgers B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
are O
the O
best O
openings O
in O
the O
Canyon. O

The O
only O
preferable O
place B-TARGET
in O
chains. O

Although O
his O
name O
is O
a O
pizza O
place, O
unfortunately, O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
average. O

I O
don't O
understand O
why O
you're O
so O
popular. O

In O
some O
pizzas, O
it's O
even O
preferable O
to O
dominoes. O

Num O
Num O
is O
the O
truth O
- O
it's O
a O
fact O
that O
everything B-TARGET
you I-TARGET
eat O
deserves O
what O
you O
get. O

Food B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
flavor O
are O
not O
discussed, O
but O
it's O
very O
difficult O
to O
find B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
place I-TARGET
during O
the O
afternoon. O

We O
love O
the O
view B-TARGET
and O
the O
souffle. B-TARGET

It O
was O
fun O
to B-TARGET
sit I-TARGET
one O
evening O
in O
Big O
Chefs O
with O
the O
lights O
on O
the O
side O
of O
Rumeli O
Hisari O
and O
the O
view I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
bridge. I-TARGET

Souffle O
is O
$13.5, B-TARGET
tea O
is O
$4.5. B-TARGET

The O
express O
inside O
the O
Levent O
Tsar O
has O
a O
younger O
look. O

It O
was O
specifically O
opened O
for O
delivery O
service. O

There's O
no O
juicy O
food B-TARGET
here. O

They've O
kept O
the O
prices B-TARGET
more O
affordable O
for O
young O
people O
and O
students. O

I've O
got O
lahmacun O
rotary O
burgers O
and O
meatballs. B-TARGET

Iftar B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
$80. O

The O
ezogelin B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
was O
too O
salty. O

And O
because O
it O
was B-TARGET
served I-TARGET
early, O
it O
cooled O
until O
iftar. O

The B-TARGET
meatloaf I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
ribs O
were O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
staff O
is O
slow O
because O
they're O
incompetent. O

After O
all, O
these O
toilets B-TARGET
don't O
look O
good O
in O
a O
place O
like O
this. O

Imagine O
a O
place O
where O
the O
drinks B-TARGET
come O
in O
glasses, O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
don't O
have O
grouchy O
wet O
wipes O
-- O
for O
no O
reason O
-- O
what O
happened O
here? O

Disappointment O

It's O
where O
I O
get O
to O
eat O
a O
few O
times. O

It's O
no O
different O
than O
the O
restaurants O
around O
here, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
slow. O

Prices O
are O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
those O
around O
here. O

They O
stir O
up O
every O
seafood B-TARGET
in O
front O
of O
you. O

To O
be O
honest, O
you O
don't O
get O
the O
taste O
of O
any O
of O
them. O

Those O
who O
don't O
like O
fish O
and O
seafood O
very O
much O
love O
fish O
because O
it's O
the O
size O
of O
KFC O
and O
there's O
plenty O
of O
fries. O

Only O
the O
salmon O
with O
soy B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was B-TARGET
successful. I-TARGET

Other O
than O
that, O
the O
summer's O
garden O
is O
a O
sweet O
cafe, B-TARGET
which O
remembers O
the O
mountain O
house, O
and O
is O
fresh O
in O
greens, O
and O
has O
a O
rich O
variety O
of O
breakfasts, I-TARGET
and O
is O
usually O
a O
place O
for O
bong O
lovers. O

A O
place O
where O
you O
can O
shamelessly O
serve O
bad O
meatballs, B-TARGET
emergency O
butter... B-TARGET

When B-TARGET
we O
warned O
the O
waiter O
so O
much, O
he O
said O
he'd O
just O
tell O
him. O

They O
didn't O
even O
apologize. O

The O
company O
that O
serves B-TARGET
espresso O
instead O
of O
Machiato. O

Empty O
glasses, O
cups, O
plates O
on O
the O
table, O
no O
pickers. B-TARGET

When O
you O
ask O
about O
the O
variety O
on O
the O
menu, O
he O
doesn't O
have O
it, O
he O
doesn't O
have O
it, O
so O
let's O
give O
him O
this O
instead, O
let's O
give O
him O
this. O

Serve O
tea B-TARGET
with O
a O
dirty, O
unwashed O
cup. O

It's O
like O
Mado's O
general O
illness O
combined. O

He O
sells B-TARGET
landscapes I-TARGET
here. O

Otherwise, O
it's O
a O
bad O
example B-TARGET
of O
the O
Mados. O

Let's O
not O
get O
ahead O
of O
ourselves, O
we O
could O
find O
a O
two-day O
paper O
and O
read O
it. O

Home B-TARGET
cooking I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
different O
every O
day O
- O
delicious O
home B-TARGET
cooking I-TARGET
like O
a O
mother's O
hand... O

The B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
is O
so O
small, O
it O
just O
fills O
up. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
times O
we B-TARGET
can't I-TARGET
find I-TARGET
a O
place O
for O
the O
afternoon. O

Usually O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
and O
the O
price B-TARGET
is O
right. O

It's O
preferable O
for O
the O
afternoon, O
but O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
12... O

It's O
a O
very O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
food O
cocktails, B-TARGET
great O
view, B-TARGET
of O
course O
you O
can O
wait O
in O
line O
for O
these O
beautiful O
things. O

I O
had O
it O
added O
to O
the O
mushroom O
pizza. O

The O
ingredients B-TARGET
are O
good, O
but O
I O
didn't O
like O
the O
dough B-TARGET
very O
much. O

Feels O
like O
he's O
ready. O

In O
general, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
cute. O

Prices O
are O
upper O
curst, O
but O
the O
flavor O
and O
size O
are O
different. O

Compared O
to O
that, O
I O
think O
the O
upper O
crust O
is O
better O
for O
dough O
and O
measurements. O

Alcohol B-TARGET
could O
hold O
them O
a O
little O
longer. O

Because O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
competition O
in O
their O
location. O

The O
restaurant O
where O
I O
eat O
the O
most O
expensive O
meal B-TARGET
of O
my O
life. O

Even O
though O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
FSM O
bridge O
is O
sitting O
on O
your O
head O
like O
hell O
is O
disturbing O
the O
scenery. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
are O
too O
small. O

There's O
valet B-TARGET
service. I-TARGET

It's O
a O
once-in-a-lifetime O
place. O

I O
had O
a O
rock B-TARGET
'n' I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
burger. I-TARGET

The O
burger B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
was O
all O
over O
the O
place. O

The O
sauce O
inside O
of O
him O
wasn't O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
ass O
either. O

If O
it's B-TARGET
going O
well, O
it's O
going O
well. O

The B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
is O
in O
an O
interesting O
mood, O
on O
weekday O
nights O
when O
the O
brothers O
are O
banging O
tea O
with O
bongs. O

She's O
married O
on O
the O
weekends, O
and O
she's O
a O
breakfast B-TARGET
center I-TARGET
for O
couples O
with O
kids. O

I O
like O
your O
food B-TARGET
and O
tea. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
very O
reasonable O
operation O
as O
a O
price. B-TARGET

That's O
my O
advice. O

Maybe O
it'd O
be O
better O
if O
they O
had O
their O
own O
beer, B-TARGET
but O
we O
had O
to O
drink O
some O
of O
the O
standard O
beer. O

Other O
than O
that, O
good O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
a O
happy, O
comfortable O
place. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
has O
different O
flavors. O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
hang O
out O
with O
friends O
after O
work O
on O
Friday. O

I O
like O
the O
menu O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
delicious O
alternatives. O

We O
liked O
it O
when O
we O
were O
downstairs O
in O
the O
Citys. O

Magnolia's B-TARGET
different, O
lemonade's B-TARGET
better. O

They B-TARGET
even I-TARGET
offer I-TARGET
a O
grilled O
cheese O
very O
carefully. O

Four O
points O
for O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
grill. I-TARGET

It's O
healthy O
and O
satisfying O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

It's O
a O
nice O
lunch B-TARGET
break. I-TARGET

Nice O
garden, B-TARGET
too. O

It's O
even O
got O
a O
swing. B-TARGET

Cold B-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
goes O
well O
on O
food, O
too. O

In O
one O
of O
the O
most O
beautiful O
parts B-TARGET
of O
the O
throat, O
the O
warm, O
sympathetic O
and O
delightful O
decorations, B-TARGET
and O
the O
wonderful O
view, O
the O
young O
clientele, O
their O
beautiful O
music, B-TARGET
is B-TARGET
excellent, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
friendly, O
smiling O
service. O

The O
breakfast B-TARGET
options I-TARGET
are O
very O
good. O

And O
the O
food's B-TARGET
not O
bad. O

Given O
all O
these O
particulars, O
prices B-TARGET
seem O
very O
reasonable. O

Day O
and O
night, O
I O
recommend O
it O
all O
the O
time. O

Especially O
in O
the O
summer. O

I'd O
say O
it's O
the O
most O
authentic O
pie O
maker B-TARGET
on O
the O
feed. O

That's O
why O
I O
didn't O
choose O
sweet O
food. O

The O
prices B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
13 O
to O
17 O
tl, O
and O
it's O
possible O
to O
grow O
the O
portions B-TARGET
by O
1.5. O

I'm B-TARGET
getting I-TARGET
a O
little O
slow O
on O
my O
score. O

It's O
pretty O
easy O
to O
get O
across O
the O
bus O
station. O

It's O
a O
small, O
but O
always O
full O
pie O
maker. O

I'm O
not O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
same O
pleasure B-TARGET
for O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
slow. O

It O
won't O
be O
long O
before O
I O
say O
slow. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
little O
time, O
you'll O
definitely O
see O
him O
around O
noon. O

It's O
the O
best O
pie O
you O
can O
eat O
in O
Besiktas, O
but O
it O
doesn't O
replace O
the O
urinal O
at O
wood O
fire. B-TARGET

They've O
got O
sweet B-TARGET
options, O
they've O
got O
blue O
souffle O
and O
kunefe, O
they've O
got O
menus, O
but O
when O
the O
pita O
gets B-TARGET
that I-TARGET
late, I-TARGET
it's O
like O
a O
human O
dessert O
order. O

Even O
though O
it's O
not O
old O
quality, B-TARGET
let's O
just O
say O
it's O
still O
good, O
whether O
it's O
demand O
or O
quality O
and O
service, B-TARGET
it's O
going O
to O
fall O
to O
the O
average, O
it's O
the O
parking B-TARGET
lot O
farms, B-TARGET
the O
problems O
are O
normal. O

It's B-TARGET
a O
cafe O
for O
the O
view, O
there's O
not O
much O
to O
write O
about. O

Prices B-TARGET
are O
standard. O

There's O
no O
parking B-TARGET
problem. O

A O
quiet, O
peaceful O
place. B-TARGET

The O
beans B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
delicious. O

Sutlaci B-TARGET
is O
recommended. O

It's O
got O
good O
meatloaf. B-TARGET

It's O
just O
a O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
employees I-TARGET
are I-TARGET
nice O
about O
it. O

It's O
a O
common O
ground. O

The O
parking B-TARGET
problem O
is O
serious. O

He's B-TARGET
got O
a O
valet, O
though. O

You B-TARGET
have O
no O
choice O
but O
brunch O
on O
Sunday O
mornings. O

Brunch B-TARGET
variants, O
ehh. O

It's O
a O
shame O
to O
charge O
extra O
for O
the O
sausage O
and O
pepperoni O
on O
the O
table. O

The B-TARGET
location I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
number O
ten, O
but O
you O
can't O
find O
a O
beachside O
table O
without O
reservations. O

59TL O
for O
a O
brunch B-TARGET
like O
this, O
5TL O
extra O
charge B-TARGET
for O
4 O
thin O
slices O
of O
sausage O
is O
irrelevant. O

It O
makes O
a O
difference O
when O
it's O
bigger O
than O
any O
other O
place O
on O
the O
Citadel, O
but O
if O
you're O
not O
a O
crowd, O
you O
might O
prefer O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Citadel. O

The O
last O
time O
we O
went O
in O
a O
rude O
group, O
there O
was O
a O
mix-up B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the O
orders, O
unfortunately. O

In O
a O
word, O
it's O
a O
wonderful O
taste, B-TARGET
the O
frosting B-TARGET
is O
a O
master's O
work. O

It's O
oily O
and O
delicious. O

The O
tandrum B-TARGET
lava I-TARGET
they O
brought O
with O
them O
is O
the O
most O
delicious O
lava O
I've O
ever O
had. O

As O
you B-TARGET
sit O
down, O
your O
order O
is O
received O
and O
served O
immediately. O

And O
they're O
bringing O
in O
salads B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
fries. I-TARGET

He's O
the O
best O
donor B-TARGET
in O
the O
open. O

Big O
chefs O
is B-TARGET
always O
an O
inflated O
cafe. O

Because O
it O
offers O
you O
prices B-TARGET
that I-TARGET
don't O
fit. O

In O
addition, O
the O
districts O
are O
in O
the O
middle. O

It's O
a O
name O
because O
it's O
expensive, O
so O
it O
creates O
quality O
perception. O

I'm O
definitely O
not O
going O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
that O
says O
20 O
tl, O
20 O
tl O
for I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
jar I-TARGET
of O
dessert. O

Because O
it's O
nothing O
but O
a O
waste O
on O
me. O

You O
have O
to O
leave O
places O
like O
this O
empty O
so O
they O
can O
move O
the O
price B-TARGET
scale I-TARGET
to O
a O
low O
range. O

Sweets O
- O
sweets B-TARGET
are O
beautiful, O
tiramisu B-TARGET
must O
be O
eaten O
especially, O
but O
it's O
as O
big O
as O
the O
day O
before! O

The B-TARGET
flour-free I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
heavy, O
so O
don't O
let O
the O
dieters O
mess O
with O
it! O

The O
food B-TARGET
has O
no O
taste. O

It's B-TARGET
all O
noise. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
aren't O
looking O
at O
you O
from O
watching O
TV. O

There's O
plenty O
of O
other O
places O
to O
eat. O

Well, O
it's O
not O
a O
very O
pleasant O
location O
as O
a O
location, O
but O
we O
sometimes O
go O
to O
lunch B-TARGET
when O
we're O
working. O

You O
won't O
believe O
the O
flavor B-TARGET
of O
the O
food, O
the O
Topkapi B-TARGET
kebabi I-TARGET
made O
with O
bacon O
is O
very O
good. O

The O
koften B-TARGET
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it. O

No O
service, B-TARGET
no O
roses. B-TARGET

They're O
eating O
the O
landscape's O
bread. O

The B-TARGET
tables I-TARGET
are O
frozen O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
store, O
so O
you O
can O
have O
them O
at O
your O
house. O

There's O
no O
difference. O

The O
place O
with O
the O
regular O
kebabs... B-TARGET

It's O
not O
exactly O
a O
go O
for O
the O
kebab, B-TARGET
but O
the O
cute B-TARGET
ones I-TARGET
are O
amazing. O

Megerse O
purifies O
the O
owners O
of O
Sergeant O
Sweets. O

We O
were O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Everyone B-TARGET
was O
very O
interested O
and O
had O
a O
smile O
on O
their O
face. O

We've O
had O
a O
bit O
of O
trouble O
finding O
the O
place, O
but O
luckily, O
we O
got O
the O
best O
spot O
on O
the O
balcony: O

We O
ordered O
a O
d B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
cigarette I-TARGET
and O
a O
meat B-TARGET
quesadilla. I-TARGET

Under O
the O
salmon O
cigarette, O
the O
cousconstruck B-TARGET
sauté I-TARGET
was O
excellent, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
generally O
good. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
quesadilla I-TARGET
was O
especially O
good O
meat. O

We'll O
definitely O
come O
back: O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
I O
like. O

Music, B-TARGET
garden, B-TARGET
good O
menu. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
refreshing O
environment, B-TARGET
and O
it's O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
for O
crowded O
meetings. O

And O
his O
employees B-TARGET
are O
smiling. O

You O
don't O
expect O
to O
find O
a O
place O
like O
this O
on O
your O
way O
in O
because O
of O
the O
position. O

Like O
the O
Emirgan O
branch O
of O
Milky O
Way, O
the O
view B-TARGET
of O
this O
branch O
is O
beautiful. O
The O
sea O
is O
right O
next O
to O
you, O
right O
across O
the O
bridge: O

) O
The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
and O
the O
prices B-TARGET
are O
good O
for O
the O
place. O

Chicken B-TARGET
breast O
successful: O

I've O
made O
a O
terrible O
reservation, O
but O
I've O
disgraced O
my O
guests. O

We O
met O
Little O
House O
Express O
with O
a O
mechanical O
event. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try B-TARGET
home-made I-TARGET
yogurts I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
pot. O

You'll O
get O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
real O
yogurt B-TARGET
we O
left O
behind O
in O
the O
old O
days. O

The O
price B-TARGET
is O
like O
a O
joke. O

$3.75. O

After O
a O
large O
meal, O
you O
can O
leave O
the O
premises O
for O
an O
average O
of O
$15.25. B-TARGET

The O
decorations B-TARGET
were O
fun, O
especially O
the O
bonsai B-TARGET
tree O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
place O
took O
me O
away. O

Yeah, O
I'm O
a O
bonsai O
fan! O

We O
were O
welcomed B-TARGET
and O
held O
together O
until O
the O
end. O

You O
guys O
are O
great. O

Keep O
it O
up! O

We O
had O
a O
little O
taste B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
everything. I-TARGET

My O
favorites O
are O
spinning O
at O
dinners, O
and B-TARGET
they're I-TARGET
baked. I-TARGET

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
the O
roast B-TARGET
cake. I-TARGET

The O
chicken B-TARGET
breast O
was O
really O
delicious O
at O
desserts. O

There O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
breast, I-TARGET
it O
was O
sweet O
and O
light. O

I O
come O
here O
a O
lot, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
who O
work O
in O
loventtes O
prefer O
it O
a O
lot. O

His O
food B-TARGET
used O
to O
be O
better, O
especially O
his O
dumplings B-TARGET
were O
very O
successful. O

But O
it's O
tempting O
to O
have O
all O
kinds O
of O
home B-TARGET
meals I-TARGET
every O
day, O
whether O
it's O
olive O
oil O
or O
hot O
food, O
it O
keeps O
you O
from O
eating O
fast O
food O
every O
day. O

Her O
olive B-TARGET
oil I-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
is O
a O
success, O
and O
I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
portion B-TARGET
of O
her O
salads. O

It's O
like O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
sea, O
but O
there's O
a O
piece O
of O
land O
in O
between. O

And O
it's O
a O
shame O
that O
they O
couldn't O
find O
a O
cure O
for O
the O
smell O
in O
there. O

Emergandak O
suts O
are O
looking O
for O
wax. O

It's O
one O
of O
those O
places B-TARGET
where O
you'll O
enjoy O
your O
own O
way O
in O
taxim. O

I'd O
consider O
it O
a O
separate O
day O
and O
night. O

I'd O
say O
the O
quality O
of O
service O
is O
better O
here O
than O
any O
branch O
I've O
ever O
been O
to O
in O
Europe. O

So O
don't O
forget O
to O
leave O
the O
type: O

I O
like O
hamburgers, B-TARGET
and O
I O
can O
recommend O
NY B-TARGET
steak. I-TARGET

As O
a O
drink, O
I O
usually O
like O
beer, O
so O
I O
can't O
say O
anything O
about O
their O
cocktails. B-TARGET

Bon O
appétit! O

I O
don't O
like O
happy B-TARGET
moons I-TARGET
anymore. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
employees B-TARGET
were O
smiling, O
but O
I O
don't O
get O
the O
taste O
I O
used O
to O
get O
from B-TARGET
their I-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

I O
like O
the O
only O
strawberry B-TARGET
lemonade I-TARGET
I O
don't O
recommend O
very O
much. O

For O
a O
view O
like O
that O
and B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
position I-TARGET
like O
that, O
the O
last O
place B-TARGET
to O
be O
would O
be O
sprouts. O

Waste O
of O
time! O

The O
food's B-TARGET
not O
bad. O

Especially O
the O
olives. B-TARGET

We O
preferred O
it O
because O
it O
was O
a O
rare O
place O
in O
the O
Galata O
area O
where O
we O
could O
eat O
olive O
oil O
or B-TARGET
home-cooked I-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

But O
they O
offer O
service B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
world's O
slowest O
homes. O

Be B-TARGET
ready O
to O
wait O
50 O
to O
70 O
minutes O
an O
hour. O

If O
it's O
not O
Ogle O
hours, O
it's O
time O
to O
wait B-TARGET
25 O
to O
30 O
minutes. O

The O
last O
thing O
we O
said O
was O
that O
the O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
dry, O
so O
we O
decided O
not O
to O
order O
again. O

The O
view B-TARGET
was O
beautiful, O
she O
was O
very O
good O
at O
decorating, B-TARGET
we O
went O
for O
breakfast, B-TARGET
breakfast O
was O
good, O
but O
I O
didn't O
like O
the O
omelet. B-TARGET
It O
was O
very O
unpleasant. O

Everything O
else O
was O
fresh, O
and O
I O
loved O
the O
way O
they O
decorated O
it O
with O
apricots O
and O
walnuts, B-TARGET
and O
they O
gave O
breakfast B-TARGET
fresh O
air. O

He B-TARGET
can O
go O
for O
breakfast, O
but O
from O
what O
I've O
seen O
the O
waiters O
serve, O
his O
meals B-TARGET
were O
small, O
and O
I O
didn't O
like O
the O
presentation. B-TARGET

In O
short, O
it's O
just O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
for O
the O
view. I-TARGET

This O
is O
where O
we O
had O
our O
first O
wedding O
anniversary O
dinner, O
nice, O
nice O
employees. B-TARGET

We O
liked O
the O
presentation. B-TARGET

It O
was B-TARGET
a O
quiet, O
happy O
dinner. O

I'll O
think O
about O
going O
back. O

It's O
the O
best O
alternative O
for O
anyone O
who's O
tired O
of O
the O
classic O
raki-fish-fall O
trilogy O
and O
wants O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
appetizers. B-TARGET

Although O
it O
does O
not O
offer O
the O
best O
option O
as O
a O
view, B-TARGET
it O
is O
worth O
trying O
all O
the O
appetizers, B-TARGET
especially O
in O
the O
Lakerda. I-TARGET

Peanut B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
appetizer, I-TARGET
a O
special O
treat O
here. O

It's O
guaranteed O
that O
you'll B-TARGET
have O
a O
pleasant O
evening O
with O
your O
rak O
and O
appetizers O
for O
60 O
lira O
each. O

From O
the O
location, O
it's O
in O
a O
very O
nice O
place, O
the O
view B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
exquisite. O

The O
lemonade B-TARGET
was O
huge O
and O
delicious, O
and O
they O
made O
it O
completely O
different O
by O
renditioning O
"crap O
toast," B-TARGET
which O
wasn't O
bad. O

But O
the O
biggest O
problem O
of O
the O
place O
is O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
service, I-TARGET
they're O
very, O
very O
slow! O

Which O
I O
think O
is O
the O
most O
important O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
service I-TARGET
to O
be O
in O
a O
place O
where O
"the O
greatest O
rescuer O
is O
the O
location B-TARGET
and O
the O
perfect O
view B-TARGET
of O
the O
throat! O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
for O
a O
nervous O
breakfast. B-TARGET

It's B-TARGET
a O
beautiful O
view. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
might O
be O
a O
little O
more O
smiling. O

40 O
tl O
head. B-TARGET

There's O
a O
rich O
buffet B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

It's O
a O
pleasant O
place. B-TARGET

Your O
recent O
years O
have O
been O
the O
biggest O
disappointment O
to O
me. O

There's O
never O
been O
a O
place O
I've B-TARGET
enjoyed O
so O
little O
of O
what O
I've O
eaten O
with O
so O
much O
curiosity. O

Waiters, B-TARGET
the O
view B-TARGET
of O
the O
place, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
wonderful, O
but O
there's O
not O
much O
I O
can O
say O
in O
the O
name O
of O
taste. B-TARGET

They O
put O
squid B-TARGET
in O
front O
of O
us O
like O
sub-bridges. O

When O
I O
wrote O
this, O
the O
account O
hadn't O
arrived O
yet, O
and O
I'm O
doing O
my O
evaluation O
in O
a O
completely O
independent O
way. O

The O
Greenville O
legend O
didn't O
go O
on O
here. B-TARGET

It's O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
we O
often O
prefer O
when O
the O
number O
of O
pleasant O
venues O
is O
few O
years O
ago, O
and O
as O
the O
number O
of O
venues O
increases, O
we O
push O
them O
back O
into O
the O
background. O

His B-TARGET
garden I-TARGET
gave O
you O
peace... O

The B-TARGET
view I-TARGET
is B-TARGET
good I-TARGET
service I-TARGET
is O
terrible, O
they O
don't O
bring O
it O
in O
three O
times O
without O
saying O
it, O
not O
twice, O
but O
five O
times O
when O
you O
think O
about O
it. O

It's O
a O
gas O
station O
with O
a O
cemetery O
view, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
a O
really O
good O
cafe. B-TARGET

Since O
E5 B-TARGET
was I-TARGET
on O
it, O
we O
quickly O
swerved O
and O
opted O
for O
the O
convenience O
of O
sitting O
a O
lot O
of O
time. O

The B-TARGET
garden I-TARGET
wasn't O
so O
bad O
for B-TARGET
a O
pleasant O
meal. O

We O
waited O
too O
long O
for O
the O
coffee O
we O
drank O
behind O
his O
back, O
but O
it's O
a O
very O
unexpected O
cafe, B-TARGET
so O
I O
gave O
him O
the O
note O
at O
3.5. O

It's O
an O
open-scared O
pita. O

The O
champagne O
found O
in O
Besiktas O
Barbaros O
is O
open O
until O
morning, O
and O
it's O
ideal O
for O
villains O
at O
night, O
and O
there's O
a O
delivery O
service, O
and O
it's O
delicious O
with O
closed B-TARGET
vaults. I-TARGET

I O
didn't O
think O
your O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
bad. O

Obviously, O
she's O
very O
sober O
and O
faint, O
but O
I O
like O
baked O
pizzas. B-TARGET

But O
Pizzeria O
Trio's O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
good, O
too. O

I O
prefer O
Trio O
Speciale. O

The B-TARGET
meat O
was O
bad, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
wasn't O
bad. O

It O
has O
an O
amazing O
view, B-TARGET
by O
the O
way. O

You O
can O
go O
for O
pizza, B-TARGET
wine, O
a O
scenic O
combo. O

Especially O
if O
you O
prefer O
his O
garden. B-TARGET

The O
open B-TARGET
area I-TARGET
is O
very O
comfortable. O

And O
it O
roared O
less. O

The O
drinks B-TARGET
are O
good, O
but O
if O
you O
prefer O
fast B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
snacks, I-TARGET
I O
wouldn't O
recommend O
it. O

The B-TARGET
food's I-TARGET
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
too O
small. O

I O
think O
the O
regimens O
have O
been O
considered. O

The O
price B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
too O
high. O

This O
used O
to O
be O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
places, O
the O
menu O
changed, O
and O
now O
even O
the O
food O
on O
the O
old O
menu O
doesn't O
taste O
the O
same, O
it O
tastes O
bad. O

If O
we O
value O
it O
outside O
the O
taste, O
it's O
a O
very O
pleasant O
place, B-TARGET
both O
in O
the I-TARGET
field I-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
comfortable O
big O
seats. O

You'll O
be O
lucky O
to O
find O
a O
place O
near O
the O
sea... O

Let's O
just O
say O
it's O
the O
best O
place B-TARGET
for O
another O
lover O
to O
have O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee O
and O
chat O
with O
friends. O

It's O
one O
of O
Kadiköy's O
beer O
gardens. O

I O
think O
his O
former O
employees B-TARGET
were O
better O
and O
more O
sincere. O

While O
noting O
the O
marginal O
appearance O
of O
their B-TARGET
current I-TARGET
employees, I-TARGET
this O
marginal O
image O
is O
slightly O
avoiding O
cool O
behavior, O
which O
reflects O
negatively O
on O
the O
ministry. O

There's O
got O
to O
be O
a O
more O
smiling O
employee B-TARGET
profile. I-TARGET

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
is O
average, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
average. O

Still, O
you O
have O
to O
go O
to B-TARGET
try O
a O
lot O
of O
beer O
and O
listen O
to O
music. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
so O
mediocre. O

He's O
always O
so O
busy. O

You O
can't O
hear O
each O
other O
in O
there O
with O
the O
music. B-TARGET

Servicemen B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
rude. O

Only O
the O
prices B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
reasonable. O

menu B-TARGET
is O
limited O

I O
suggest O
you O
try O
a O
view B-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
where O
I O
can O
recommend O
cizbiz B-TARGET
coste, O
sutis B-TARGET
moccachino, I-TARGET
dtox O
corbasi O
and O
weekend I-TARGET
breakfast I-TARGET
wealth, O
with O
the O
comfort O
of O
transportation. B-TARGET

It's O
one O
of O
those O
places O
where O
you O
get O
famous O
on O
social O
media, O
and O
then O
you O
lose O
quality. B-TARGET

The O
view O
is O
great, O
the O
service O
is O
medium, O
but O
the O
food O
is O
bad. O

My O
friend O
sang O
love B-TARGET
memnu, I-TARGET
so O
I O
sang O
cheesecake. B-TARGET

They O
were O
both O
stopped O
and O
used O
bad O
quality O
materials. B-TARGET

At O
least O
I'd O
expect O
them O
to O
take O
care O
of O
their O
sweets, B-TARGET
identified O
by O
their O
names. O

I'm O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
there's O
a O
business B-TARGET
in O
Kuruşme O
that O
makes O
sense O
in O
what O
we're O
going O
to O
give O
you O
in O
this O
view. O

I'm O
not O
suggesting, O
I'm O
sure O
you'll O
find O
a O
place O
around O
here O
with O
the O
same O
view, B-TARGET
but O
it's O
made O
with O
fresh O
and O
good O
material, O
courtesy O
of O
the O
customer. O

Anzarasis B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
great... O

- O
This O
is O
a O
place O
where O
I O
try O
to O
visit O
once O
a O
week O
and O
love O
the O
view. B-TARGET

But O
something's O
not O
too O
good O
to O
eat. B-TARGET

Their B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
is O
like O
a O
third O
grade O
cake O
shop... O

And O
it O
usually O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
to O
get B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
seat I-TARGET
because O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
mediocre. O

The B-TARGET
fork, I-TARGET
the O
knife, O
the O
dirty O
and O
walnut B-TARGET
baklava I-TARGET
makes O
you O
sick O
to O
your O
stomach. O

And O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
baklava's B-TARGET
burned. O

Peanut B-TARGET
shakes I-TARGET
are O
fine. O

There's O
no O
need O
to O
stop O
by. O
There O
are O
so O
many O
better O
places. O

It's O
a O
lovely O
cafe B-TARGET
in O
Karakoy. O

It O
was O
ideal O
for O
three O
people. O

You O
have O
to O
come O
often O
and O
try O
all O
the O
teas. B-TARGET

Prices O
are O
high, O
but O
they're O
worth O
the O
money. O

The O
decorations B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice. O

They B-TARGET
have O
very O
comfortable O
seats. O

You O
can O
sit O
around O
for O
hours O
and O
talk O
about O
quality O
tea. B-TARGET

My O
friend O
said O
gin O
and O
tea O
in O
the O
private O
pot, O
and O
I O
said O
home-made O
coffee O
on O
the O
rocks. O

Ice B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
was O
the O
best O
iced O
tea O
I've O
ever O
had O
in O
my O
life. O

The O
sugar B-TARGET
ratio I-TARGET
was O
good, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
refreshing. O

And O
the O
taste O
of O
gin B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
was O
so O
good. O

The O
melon B-TARGET
flavor I-TARGET
was O
all O
right, O
but O
the O
drink O
didn't O
end. O

One O
of O
the O
places O
where O
you O
can O
go O
as O
price B-TARGET
/performance O
is O
the O
Tall B-TARGET
Kebab. I-TARGET

One O
click O
is O
better O
than O
the O
kebabs O
in O
the O
market. O

You O
can O
go B-TARGET
on O
a O
weekend O
trip, O
and O
when O
you're O
hungry, O
you O
can O
eat O
my O
food O
and O
get O
up O
right O
away, O
which O
makes O
sense. O

It's O
a O
terrible O
place, B-TARGET
I O
feel O
like O
I'm O
waiting O
in O
line B-TARGET
for O
people O
to O
be O
miserable. O

Don't O
ever O
go. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
be O
humiliated O
by O
your O
money, O
I O
say O
go O
ahead. O

It's O
a O
process O
that's O
going O
on O
with O
an O
eye-starting O
economic O
life, O
almost O
all O
over O
the O
street. O

Almost O
everything B-TARGET
in O
your O
menu O
is O
delicious. O

Especially O
when O
it's O
open, O
it's O
like O
having O
breakfast O
at O
your O
house O
in B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
morning. I-TARGET

You O
must O
be O
there O
early O
at O
lunch, O
or O
you O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
find O
food. O

It's O
a O
standard O
breakfast, B-TARGET
but O
the O
environment, B-TARGET
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
location B-TARGET
of O
the O
shop O
is O
increasing O
the O
cheetah. O

Especially O
when O
Mr. O
Sezgin, O
the O
serviceman, B-TARGET
did O
his O
job O
so O
well, O
and O
took O
care O
of O
everyone O
with O
the O
same O
smile, O
and O
did O
nothing O
to O
cross-table O
slalom, O
which O
earned O
all O
of O
our O
sympathy O
and O
appreciation. O

I O
think O
it's O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
cafes B-TARGET
to O
go O
to O
in O
Skysu. O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
friends O
who O
are O
close O
to O
this O
location O
with O
its O
wide O
garden I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
terrace I-TARGET
can O
enjoy O
a O
bong O
in O
the O
open O
in O
the O
summer O
evening. O

You O
can O
eat O
burritos O
on O
the O
way O
out? O

It's B-TARGET
pretty O
easy. O

It O
works O
with O
the O
valet O
system O
in O
the O
parking O
lot. O

It's B-TARGET
so I-TARGET
well-made I-TARGET
that O
you O
say O
you've O
done O
well O
before O
you've O
tasted O
the O
food. O

Meats, B-TARGET
appetizers, I-TARGET
salads I-TARGET
and O
potatoes B-TARGET
don't O
exactly O
make O
you O
the O
opposite. O

It's O
all O
so O
delicious. O

I've O
been O
going O
in O
and O
out O
since O
the O
emergency. O

For O
banning O
alcohol O
(in O
its O
own O
words O
one O
of O
the O
15% O
client. O

I'm O
not O
going O
anymore. O

God O
bless O
those O
who O
forbid O
it! O

Mediocre O
- O
compared O
to O
the O
kebabists O
in O
Istanbul O
- O
is O
really O
mediocre. O

But O
if O
you O
think O
I'm O
interested O
in O
seeing O
a O
new O
place B-TARGET
and O
not O
a O
kebab, I-TARGET
it's O
highly O
recommended. O

But O
it O
shouldn't O
go O
with O
too O
much O
expectation, O
and O
then O
it O
shouldn't O
be O
too O
sad: O

It's O
a O
luxury O
restaurant O
where O
you O
can O
eat O
your O
special-day B-TARGET
meals. I-TARGET

I O
recommend O
domestic B-TARGET
and O
especially O
home-building B-TARGET
souffle. I-TARGET

If O
you O
tell O
me O
about O
your O
special O
day B-TARGET
during O
the O
reservation, O
it's O
a O
nice O
gesture O
of O
champagne. O

It's O
a O
good O
restaurant O
with O
food B-TARGET
and O
flavor. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
times I-TARGET
are I-TARGET
a O
little O
long, O
and O
the O
prices B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
expensive O
according O
to O
the O
physical O
quality O
of O
the O
place. O

More O
modest O
menu B-TARGET
prices I-TARGET
can O
be O
visited O
more O
often O

I O
love O
chocolate O
baklava. B-TARGET
It's O
definitely O
my O
favorite, O
honey. O

The O
quality B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
flavor O
of O
all O
your O
other O
desserts O
is O
high. O

Gülluoğlu B-TARGET
is O
an O
expert. O

If O
we're O
talking O
about O
the O
prince O
of O
Nusret O
meat, B-TARGET
we O
know O
what O
we're O
saying. O

The O
E O
t's B-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

Even O
if O
I O
do O
the O
same O
at O
home O
as O
a O
cook O
candidate, O
Nusret's B-TARGET
is O
different. O

Those O
of O
you O
who O
like O
good O
food B-TARGET
should O
try O
it. O

I O
wanted O
a O
Jumbo B-TARGET
combo I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a O
Coke, O
but O
other O
than O
the O
dumplings B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
chicken O
parts, O
the O
flavors O
weren't O
for O
me. O

I O
don't O
like O
the B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
and O
the O
onion B-TARGET
rings I-TARGET
taste O
sweet. O

I O
regret O
not O
wanting O
nachos. B-TARGET

He O
was O
calm, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
Saturday. O

I O
wanted O
to O
connect O
to O
the O
wifi B-TARGET
because O
the O
phone O
didn't O
work, O
but O
as O
long O
as O
I O
sat O
down, O
I O
didn't O
succeed. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
fast O
and O
the O
employees B-TARGET
were O
positive. O

It's O
a O
nice O
cafe, B-TARGET
but O
unfortunately O
it's O
not O
hard B-TARGET
rock. I-TARGET

Frankly, O
I O
don't O
think O
it's O
a O
very O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
it, O
so O
I O
thought O
I'd O
take O
a O
look O
at O
it O
when O
I O
was O
next O
to O
the O
press, O
but O
I O
had O
to O
sit O
down O
and O
get O
up. O

There's O
only O
Turkish O
coffee, O
and O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
kinds O
of O
tea O
that O
may O
taste O
good, O
but O
I O
think O
it's O
expensive O
and O
unnecessary. O

And O
I O
also O
wanted O
to O
try O
your O
place O
here O
recently, O
but O
it's O
a O
complete O
disappointment, O
but O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
indifferent, O
and O
according O
to O
their O
other O
subs, O
there's O
no O
such O
thing O
as O
an O
unsettled O
and O
uncomfortable O
view, B-TARGET
so O
he's O
looking O
at O
houses O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
bridge, O
and O
it's O
not O
worth O
going O
empty, O
but O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
the O
first O
and O
last O
time O
I'm O
going O
to O
go O
to O
the O
service, O
and O
it's O
going O
to B-TARGET
be O
the O
first O
and O
the O
last, O
but O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
really O
good O
salads O
for O
the O
service. O

If O
you O
and O
your O
friends O
are O
thinking O
of O
drinking O
something O
that's O
not O
too O
loud, O
it's O
the O
perfect O
Lemon O
Garden B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
feel O
each O
other's O
voices O
in O
peace. O

Her B-TARGET
cats I-TARGET
chasing I-TARGET
each O
other O
in O
her O
garden O
makes O
butterflies O
fly O
in O
your O
stomach! O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
the O
order O
comes O
too O
late O
and O
the O
performance-price B-TARGET
union O
of O
food O
is O
not O
consistent. O

It's O
a O
place O
that O
lowers O
quality O
and O
reduces O
material B-TARGET
because O
of O
popularity. O

Look O
for O
peanuts B-TARGET
in O
the O
baklava O
so O
you O
can O
find O
them. O

There's O
a O
good O
chance O
the O
groceries B-TARGET
are O
stale, O
so O
be O
careful. O

Water B-TARGET
pie's I-TARGET
bad, O
too. O

It's O
not O
even O
worth O
sitting O
in O
that O
crowd. O

Normal O
place, B-TARGET
normal O
flavors. B-TARGET

We O
took O
credit O
for O
it, O
but O
sometimes O
when O
you O
look O
forward O
to O
it, O
you O
don't O
appreciate O
what O
you O
think O
is O
normal. O

I O
think O
there's O
an O
appetizer B-TARGET
problem O
even O
in O
places O
called O
good O
in O
the O
country. O

Ordinary O
flavors. B-TARGET

That's B-TARGET
the O
same O
thing O
here. O

It's O
always O
fun O
- O
one O
of O
the O
places B-TARGET
I've O
always O
enjoyed. O

It's B-TARGET
a O
beautiful O
garden. O

They B-TARGET
host O
their O
guests O
very O
well. O

Canyon B-TARGET
Road I-TARGET
and O
Big B-TARGET
Burger I-TARGET
are O
always O
my O
favorite. O

I'm O
sorry, O
I O
wrote O
that O
a O
little O
while O
ago. O

I O
thought O
I'd O
rewrite O
it. O

Somebody O
please O
warn O
the O
ladies O
at O
the O
back O
table: O

They're O
laughing O
so O
loud, O
they're O
having O
fun. O

Don't O
cross O
the O
line O
-- O
a O
place O
that's O
positioned O
in O
a O
nice O
place O
and O
doesn't O
regret O
it O
when O
you're O
visually O
coming O
in O
when O
you're O
going O
in. O

This O
place O
cooks O
a O
lot O
of O
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
and O
presentation, B-TARGET
hygiene, O
everybody's O
got O
to O
go O
in O
hot. O

Beautiful O
view, B-TARGET
inadequate O
menu B-TARGET
-- O
the O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Otagtepe I-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
but O
unfortunately O
there's O
no O
menu O
wealth, O
no O
food B-TARGET
quality O
to O
fit O
this O
view. O

The B-TARGET
quality I-TARGET
of O
service O
isn't O
good O
either. O

The O
seafood B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
isn't O
good. O

It's O
best O
to O
say O
something O
like O
hamburgers, B-TARGET
Wraps, I-TARGET
sandwiches I-TARGET
without O
risk. O

They're O
also O
booking B-TARGET
so O
you're O
Numnum, O
who's O
to O
say O
you're O
in O
the O
mood? O

After O
hearing O
it O
from O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
we O
went O
to O
the O
place O
at O
noon, O
and O
it O
was O
empty, O
contrary O
to O
what O
was O
said, O
but O
it O
filled O
up O
quite O
a O
bit. O

I O
tried O
the B-TARGET
mac I-TARGET
and O
cheese, O
but O
I O
can't O
say O
I O
like O
it O
very O
much. O

When O
I O
try O
the O
olive O
oils, O
I'll O
have O
my O
full O
opinion. O

It's O
been O
our O
weekend O
spot O
for O
three O
months, O
and O
they O
wrote O
10 O
tl, O
like O
the O
coffeehouse, O
and O
it O
ended O
up O
in O
our O
eyes O
that O
day. O

They're O
leaving, O
so O
be O
careful O
already. O

My O
other O
place B-TARGET
where B-TARGET
I'm I-TARGET
a O
regular, O
we O
love O
the O
super-food O
cooker, B-TARGET
honey I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
green O
lentil O
soup, O
chestnut O
souffle, O
and O
healthy O
fresh I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
water I-TARGET
from O
the O
throat, O
I O
say O
you're O
happy O
to O
eat. O

It's O
a O
place O
for O
a O
fancy O
family O
with O
the O
right O
price, B-TARGET
according O
to O
the O
view I-TARGET
found O
in O
the O
fethipaşa O
grove. O

In O
particular, O
you O
should O
try O
samaver B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
on O
the O
terrace O
in O
the O
summer O
evenings. O

For O
summer O
months, O
his O
garden B-TARGET
may O
be O
the O
most O
spacious O
place O
in O
the O
cradle. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
delicious, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast, O
and O
the O
employees B-TARGET
are O
smiling. O

And O
the O
interior B-TARGET
decorations I-TARGET
are O
nice. O

Music B-TARGET
is O
also O
in O
harmony O
with O
the O
environment. O

Unfortunately, O
it's O
just O
a O
brunch B-TARGET
place O
on O
Sunday. O

If O
you O
haven't O
tried O
his O
breakfast, B-TARGET
you O
should O
try O
it. O
There's O
so O
many O
different O
kinds, O
and O
you're O
surprised O
which O
one O
we O
should O
eat. O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
we O
can O
enjoy O
the O
market O
for O
hours. O

There's O
not O
a O
word O
for O
the O
view B-TARGET
anyway. O

The O
price B-TARGET
of O
a O
place O
like O
this, O
of O
course, O
is O
expensive. O

It's O
about O
waiters, B-TARGET
the O
food's B-TARGET
good. O

The O
famous O
fisherman B-TARGET
of O
salt. O

Pretty O
low O
quality B-TARGET
compared O
to O
the O
old O
one. O

Used O
to O
be B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
place I-TARGET
that O
served O
a O
smaller, O
limited O
number O
of O
customers, O
but O
didn't O
spoil O
its O
quality. O

Unfortunately, O
it's O
quality B-TARGET
in O
the O
last O
year, O
and O
it's O
been O
pretty O
rough O
on O
the O
service. B-TARGET

I O
think O
desserts B-TARGET
should O
be O
tried. O

And O
the O
view B-TARGET
is O
also O
beautiful. O

An O
alternative B-TARGET
to O
lunch O
for O
the O
Plaza O
people, O
I O
think. O

When O
we're O
looking O
for O
a O
change, O
we're O
actually O
eating O
something O
that's O
not O
quite O
what O
we're O
looking O
for. O

I O
think O
they're O
selling O
house B-TARGET
meals I-TARGET
more O
than O
they O
deserve. O

It's O
a O
lovely O
place B-TARGET
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
sky. O

And O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

They O
obviously O
don't O
care O
much O
for O
the O
visual. O

But O
I'll O
give O
you O
ten O
points O
for O
service. B-TARGET

It O
was O
the O
best O
kofte B-TARGET
I've O
had O
in O
a O
long O
time. O

She O
was O
so O
good O
at O
hamburgers. B-TARGET

The O
roka B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
a O
success O
with O
mushrooms O
in B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
stew. I-TARGET

We'll O
come O
back O
to O
try O
it O
on O
for O
breakfast. O

More O
places B-TARGET
to O
be O
in O
Istanbul. O

Nice B-TARGET
design. O

Even O
when O
it's O
crowded, O
it's O
too O
spacious O
to O
feel O
around O
the O
tables. O

Especially O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
a O
student O
at O
the O
University O
of O
Bosporus O
should O
stop O
by O
a O
lot. O

The O
food B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
can O
be O
improved. O

Prices B-TARGET
are O
fine. O

We've O
tried O
Quattro B-TARGET
Stagioni I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Orto, I-TARGET
but O
it's O
below O
our O
expectations. O

His B-TARGET
tiramisu B-TARGET
is O
much O
more O
successful O
than O
his O
pizzas. O

And O
the O
miniature O
model B-TARGET
of O
the O
shop O
is O
so O
cute. O

I O
don't O
think O
it's O
very O
successful O
because O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
being O
served, B-TARGET
so O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
aren't O
too O
good, O
the O
meat O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
it's O
good O
for O
your O
island B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
try O
somewhere O
else O
because O
it's O
better. O

Medium... O

- O
Ambiansi B-TARGET
is O
nice. O

I O
don't O
find O
food B-TARGET
successful, O
burgers B-TARGET
tasteless, O
meat O
they O
use O
for O
fajitas. B-TARGET

Usually O
because O
it's O
too O
crowded, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
done O
in O
a O
rush. O

Happy O
Moon's O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
Kadiköy. O

It O
can O
happen O
every O
hour O
of O
every O
day. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
kind O
of O
fast. O
The O
place B-TARGET
decorations I-TARGET
are O
really O
good. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
great, O
but O
I O
can't O
say O
the O
same O
for O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
cheese O
omelet B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
menemen O
were O
delicious, O
but O
the O
fries B-TARGET
were O
too O
fat. O

I'm O
afraid O
the O
coffee B-TARGET
was O
cold. O

I O
think O
it's O
overrated. O

No O
matter O
how O
many O
times O
the O
oil O
was O
used O
to O
fry B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
potatoes, I-TARGET
it O
was O
covered O
in O
black O
oil, O
and O
the O
potatoes B-TARGET
were O
like O
pastries. O

Tomato/salata-slash-expected. B-TARGET

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
chaotic O
activity O
around O
here O
that O
makes O
it O
hard O
for O
you O
to O
enjoy O
what O
you're O
eating. O

I O
don't O
think O
I'll O
be O
able O
to O
go O
back O
with O
an O
average O
spin O
on O
it. O

There's O
a O
place O
where O
I O
love O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
I O
have O
to O
taste O
every O
lovely O
appetizer. B-TARGET
Yes, O
I O
wish O
the O
prices I-TARGET
were O
more O
humane, O
but O
what O
can O
I O
do? O
But O
I O
enjoy O
it O
so O
much O
that O
the O
money O
we O
give O
doesn't O
hurt. O
It O
just O
makes O
us O
go O
less O
and O
less. O

The O
place O
of O
the O
rare O
roseloglu O
has O
a O
good-looking O
and O
fresh O
flavor B-TARGET
only O
to O
me O
it's O
very O
sweet, O
the O
palate O
can O
come O
from O
my O
taste. O
I've O
tried O
it O
all O
often, O
it's O
very O
fancy B-TARGET
baklava. I-TARGET

It's O
an O
excellent O
alternative, O
except O
for O
Chengelville's O
sloppy O
subtartial O
breakfast. O

You O
can O
tell O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
place B-TARGET
has O
been O
really O
put O
to O
work. O

No O
matter O
how O
busy O
the O
service B-TARGET
is, O
everything B-TARGET
that O
gets O
eaten O
fast O
is O
delicious. O

I'm O
still O
the O
only O
sultan O
in O
my O
heart O
about O
bacon B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
eggs. O

I O
wouldn't O
say O
Hasan O
Kolcuoglu O
is O
very O
expensive, O
but O
the B-TARGET
account O
is O
kind O
of O
high, O
and O
it's O
supposed O
to O
be O
open, O
but O
it's O
actually O
smoking O
indoors. B-TARGET

The O
appetizers B-TARGET
are O
so O
diverse O
and O
delicious, O
and O
the B-TARGET
kebab I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
so O
good, O
it's O
so O
delicious, O
but O
you O
have O
to O
get O
a O
fix B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

It's O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
waste O
to O
pay O
for O
what B-TARGET
you I-TARGET
want I-TARGET
and O
not O
eat O
what O
you O
want, O
so O
I O
think O
it O
should O
change. O

It's O
a O
good O
place O
to O
eat O
ravioli B-TARGET
with O
a O
truffle O
of O
olive O
oil. O

But O
once O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
tavern, O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
our O
friends, O
and O
they O
forced O
us O
to O
bring O
10 O
appetizers, O
and O
they O
said O
we O
couldn't O
sit O
down O
if O
we O
didn't O
want O
the O
appetizer. O

It O
was B-TARGET
a O
nice O
place, O
except O
for O
a O
few O
naughty O
waiters. I-TARGET

It's O
one O
of O
the O
best O
and O
most O
decent O
places B-TARGET
in O
Anatolian O
Yakasi O
to O
eat O
kebabs. I-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
heat O
are B-TARGET
delicious. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
too O
fast. O

Workers B-TARGET
have I-TARGET
a O
smile O
on O
their O
faces. O

It's O
a O
good O
choice O
for O
people B-TARGET
who O
like O
food. O

I O
especially O
liked O
the O
logic, O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
and O
so O
on. O

It's O
just O
that O
the O
last O
time O
I O
left, O
I O
didn't O
like O
the B-TARGET
way O
the O
employees O
treated O
me, O
so O
they O
should O
be O
more O
careful O
about O
it. O

The O
decorations B-TARGET
are O
very O
successful. O

The O
appetizers B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice O
and O
diverse. O

But O
as O
for B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
fish, I-TARGET
I O
stopped. O

It's O
a O
farm B-TARGET
fish. I-TARGET

I O
was O
expecting O
a O
more O
delicious B-TARGET
main I-TARGET
course, I-TARGET
actually. O

Prices B-TARGET
are O
above O
average O
bar O
prices. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
meat O
is O
low, O
but O
it's O
rare O
where O
it O
cooks. O

I O
ate O
Penne's B-TARGET
record, O
which O
was O
good, O
but O
then O
my O
stomach O
burned O
all O
day. O

My O
friend O
ate O
chicken, B-TARGET
and O
he O
went O
through O
the O
same O
thing. O

The O
service, B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
attention, I-TARGET
the O
perfect O
food, B-TARGET
can O
cause O
an O
upset O
stomach. O

Best O
fried O
eggs B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
had. O

Don't O
say O
what's O
good O
about O
eggs. B-TARGET

I O
don't O
know O
if O
it's O
the O
environment O
or O
the O
eggs O
or O
the O
butter. O

Don't O
say O
it's O
ridiculous, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
roasted O
legend, O
and O
drink O
it B-TARGET
in O
a O
bowl O
of O
copper. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
standard, O
the O
person O
waiting O
at O
the O
door O
in O
style O
is O
cold B-TARGET
and O
inverted... O

The O
waiter O
who's O
looking O
at O
us O
has O
to O
order O
with O
a O
loud O
voice. O

In O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
places, O
human O
relationships O
make O
a O
difference. O

It O
used O
to O
be O
better. O

Now O
it's O
factory. O

Service. O

Easy O
does O
it. O

Prices B-TARGET
are O
skyrocketing. O

It's O
not O
about O
taste B-TARGET
anymore, O
it's O
about O
popularity. O

I'd O
be O
sorry O
if O
I O
were O
you. O

The B-TARGET
location O
is O
great, O
the O
flavor B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
really O
good, O
and O
every O
time O
I O
go, O
they O
don't O
compromise O
the O
same O
evil. O

Someone O
has O
to O
solve O
this O
problem. O

Hot, O
warm, O
warm, O
and O
sincere, O
wooden O
house B-TARGET
cafe... I-TARGET

It's O
been O
an O
indispensable O
breakfast, B-TARGET
so O
you O
can O
come O
over O
here O
for O
us O
this O
weekend O
and O
have O
a O
good O
time. O

I O
took O
their O
backs O
as O
a O
package, O
carefully O
packed, B-TARGET
even O
though O
I'd O
had O
a O
long O
journey, O
and O
when O
I O
opened O
it, O
it O
was O
still O
warm. O

I'm O
very O
pleased O
that O
it's O
not O
cut O
off O
from B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
material I-TARGET
and O
the O
taste O
of O
its B-TARGET
meat. I-TARGET

One O
day O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
who O
brought O
the O
lunch O
menu, O
didn't O
bring O
it O
back O
one O
day O
later, O
saying, O
"I O
took O
the O
initiative, O
but O
I O
won't O
be O
able O
to O
give O
it O
to O
you O
anymore." O

Definitely O
don't O
go, O
the O
treatment's O
bad. O

It's O
an O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
tea I-TARGET
or I-TARGET
coffee I-TARGET
afterwards. O

Besides, O
you O
can O
rest O
with O
the O
peace O
of O
the O
throat, O
sit O
for O
long O
hours O
with O
a O
deep O
conversation O
with O
friends, O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of B-TARGET
live I-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

If O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
really O
expensive O
but O
quality O
and O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
it's O
definitely O
preferable. O

I O
can't O
tell O
you O
how O
sweet O
the O
drop B-TARGET
gum O
they O
add O
to O
their O
likes O
is. O

We've O
tried O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
beginnings, B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
they're I-TARGET
all O
delicious. O

We O
preferred O
the B-TARGET
souffle I-TARGET
as O
a O
dessert, O
and O
we O
loved O
it. O

It's O
perfect. O

All O
that's O
missing O
is O
that O
even O
though O
we O
wanted O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
we O
ran O
into O
a O
very O
dirty O
meat. O

It's O
a O
tradesman's O
restaurant O
with O
wonderful O
foods B-TARGET
in O
the O
UScudar O
that's O
been O
protecting O
its O
design O
for O
years. O

According O
to O
the O
shop, O
the O
prices B-TARGET
are O
expensive O
and O
there O
are O
no O
credit O
cards. B-TARGET

But O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
really O
delicious. O

And O
I'd O
recommend O
the O
sweets O
with O
the B-TARGET
semolina O
and O
the O
sutlaci B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
oven. O

My B-TARGET
favorite I-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
place O
in O
Istanbul O
for O
years. O

I O
never O
finish O
a O
pizza B-TARGET
myself O
when O
I'm O
gone. O

If O
there's O
three O
of O
us, O
we O
usually O
order O
two O
pizzas. O

In O
order O
to O
try O
more O
than O
one O
pizza, O
I O
say O
make O
two B-TARGET
halves I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
pizza O
different. O

The O
servings B-TARGET
are O
very, O
very O
bad. O

The O
only O
good O
thing O
about O
this O
place O
is O
that O
there's O
a O
garden O
in O
the O
green O
in O
a O
alley O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
street. O

There's O
a O
big O
bug O
in O
Turk's B-TARGET
coffee. I-TARGET

When O
you O
cut O
the B-TARGET
coffee, I-TARGET
you O
meet O
the O
bug O
in O
the O
outside! O

You've O
got O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
food! B-TARGET

Never O
again! O

I O
don't O
know O
why, O
but O
I O
love O
it B-TARGET
here. O

The O
Lynchburgs B-TARGET
are O
beautiful. O

Gin B-TARGET
cocktails I-TARGET
are O
worth O
a O
shot, O
but O
you O
can't O
make O
a O
friend O
Jager B-TARGET
mojito. I-TARGET

Sit O
down, O
0! O

The O
guy's O
80/90 B-TARGET
tl I-TARGET
account O
is O
too O
much, O
and O
we've O
had O
too O
little O
to O
eat. O

Tasty's B-TARGET
good, O
but O
it's O
not O
proportional O
to B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
price, I-TARGET
the O
services O
are B-TARGET
low, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
good. O

Nice O
view. B-TARGET

Although O
it's O
in O
the O
dryer, O
it's O
a O
very O
tidy O
place. B-TARGET

I'm O
afraid O
it's O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
the B-TARGET
table I-TARGET
was O
boarded O
up. O

It O
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
more O
fun. O

I O
don't O
think O
I'm O
going O
back O
after O
all O
that O
noise. O

The B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the O
imported O
cheese O
plate O
is O
so O
inadequate, O
most O
of O
it O
isn't O
even O
imported. O

The O
price B-TARGET
is O
above O
average O
for O
a O
place O
like O
this. O

It's O
a O
good O
environment B-TARGET
for O
people O
who O
want O
to O
eat O
in O
the O
open. O

You O
can O
eat O
calmly O
in O
his O
garden. B-TARGET

The O
lamb B-TARGET
mists I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
llamas O
were O
beautiful... O

There's O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
always O
drop O
something... O

Breakfast B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
food, O
and O
you O
don't O
usually O
run O
out, O
so O
the O
price B-TARGET
would O
be O
a O
little O
more O
appropriate, O
but O
the O
ones B-TARGET
who O
work O
would O
be O
a O
little O
bit O
bigger, O
but O
if O
the O
areas O
and O
tables B-TARGET
were O
bigger, O
we O
could O
sit O
down O
and O
have O
a O
more O
pleasant O
breakfast. O

It's O
a O
place O
in O
Kadıköy O
that O
you O
can't O
even O
find O
out O
most O
of O
the O
time, O
which O
is O
highly O
preferred O
because O
of O
its O
central O
location B-TARGET
and O
its O
large O
menu. O

We O
used O
to O
prefer O
the O
menus O
for O
places O
like O
Midpoint-House O
Cafe O
at O
a O
more O
affordable O
price. O

But O
the O
last O
two O
times O
I O
left, O
I O
found O
it O
very O
expensive. B-TARGET

I've O
never O
had O
any O
trouble O
with O
food, B-TARGET
but O
there's O
only O
one O
cajun B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
I O
can O
say O
is O
delicious. O

Now O
it's O
just O
an O
average O
location B-TARGET
in O
my O
eyes. O

I'm O
a O
long-standing O
customer O
of B-TARGET
the O
salt O
fisherman. O

From O
the O
first O
day O
it O
opens, O
I'll O
come O
and O
go O
to O
this O
day. O

It's O
a O
place O
from B-TARGET
a O
cute O
shop O
where O
it's O
so O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
place O
that's O
quite O
affordable. I-TARGET

But O
I'm O
afraid O
it's O
an O
old O
flavor? B-TARGET

No. O

The O
bigger O
the O
place, O
the O
lower O
the O
quality. B-TARGET

Oh, O
Sezgin O
Abi, O
we O
long O
for B-TARGET
your O
old O
taste. O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
come O
to O
the O
crib O
by O
bus O
and O
you O
come O
from O
the O
chain, O
and O
it O
hits O
you O
straight O
in O
the O
eye. O

I O
think O
the O
top B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
terrace I-TARGET
is O
much O
better O
in O
good O
service, I-TARGET
and O
you've O
got O
a O
crowd O
of O
people O
running O
in O
front O
of O
you, O
and O
the O
tree O
right O
next O
to O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
different O
vibe. O

You O
can O
come O
here O
to O
eat O
while O
you're O
out O
in O
the O
spring, O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
has O
a O
nice O
dick O
menu. B-TARGET

Prices B-TARGET
were O
not O
too O
expensive, O
but O
average. O

Cookshop O
makes O
me O
think O
of O
Magnolia. B-TARGET

Don't O
come O
in O
here O
and O
leave O
until O
you O
try O
this O
sweet B-TARGET
thing. O

Eggplant O
from O
the O
pasta, B-TARGET
nice I-TARGET
pecs. I-TARGET

My O
friend O
ate O
lasagne, B-TARGET
but O
he O
didn't O
like O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
needs O
to O
be O
upgraded. O
They're B-TARGET
late I-TARGET
to I-TARGET
order. I-TARGET

I O
tried O
Gmall O
and O
Canyon, O
but O
it O
didn't O
work. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
unsuccessful, O
the O
menu O
was O
rich, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
successful, O
but O
the O
first O
time O
it O
opened, O
it O
spoiled O
its O
flavor O
quality. O

Beans B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
rice O
pudding O
- O
one O
of O
the O
places O
I O
go O
all O
the O
time. O

They're O
from O
Rize, O
beans O
from O
Ispir... O

When O
you O
mix O
your B-TARGET
butter I-TARGET
with B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
view, I-TARGET
don't O
eat O
it O
and O
sleep O
next O
to O
it... O

Oh, O
and O
you've O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
bulimic O
brine B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
pudding I-TARGET
on O
top O
of O
it. O

Ideal... O

- O
It's O
an O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
sit O
in O
a O
cafe O
on O
the O
coast O
of O
Tuzla O
and O
have O
a O
drink. O

It's B-TARGET
better O
than O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be. O

If O
I O
didn't O
compare O
it O
to O
a O
Hatay O
bracelet, B-TARGET
of O
course, O
but O
it O
was O
delicious. O

It O
can O
be O
suggested O
tea, O
sahlepi, B-TARGET
kinefe B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
ice O
cream. O

It's O
called O
lemonade B-TARGET
home O
construction, O
and O
it's O
got O
mints O
and O
so O
on O
and O
so O
forth, O
so O
on O
and O
so O
forth, O
and O
we O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
had O
mints, O
and O
they O
said O
he O
didn't O
have O
mints O
right O
now. O

He O
was O
supposed O
to O
inform B-TARGET
us O
when O
we O
brought O
him O
in O
without O
asking. O

Of O
course, O
these O
are O
little O
things. O

It's O
still O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
be O
in O
Tuzla. O

- O
The O
way B-TARGET
out O
of O
Dilruba O
is O
difficult O
and O
exhausting, O
but O
it's O
worth O
going O
for O
the O
bong. B-TARGET

And O
the O
kebabs B-TARGET
are O
delicious. O

And O
in O
the O
morning, O
with O
100 O
kinds O
of O
breakfast B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a O
unique O
view, B-TARGET
it's O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
better. O

It's O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
be O
seen. O

Yesterday O
we O
were O
at O
the O
Abbey O
where O
we O
tasted O
the O
unique O
flavors B-TARGET
of O
the O
family. O

Sweets B-TARGET
were O
great. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
taste O
until O
the B-TARGET
check O
came O
in. O

$342 B-TARGET
is O
too O
much. O

Well, O
it's O
strange O
that O
the B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
was O
removed, O
as O
it O
turns O
out. O

It O
can O
be O
tried O
if O
you're O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
different O
types B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
pita. I-TARGET

We O
tried O
the O
cousbasin. O

Well, O
there O
you O
go. O

But O
I'd O
say O
it's O
good O
for O
people O
who O
don't O
eat O
too O
much O
pita. B-TARGET

His B-TARGET
soup's I-TARGET
cold. O

It O
didn't O
taste O
very O
good. O

Souffle's B-TARGET
normal. O

The O
Besiktas O
are O
in B-TARGET
the O
central O
area. O

Everybody's O
always O
rubbing... O

But O
the O
food's B-TARGET
pretty O
standard, O
and O
some O
of O
it's O
pretty O
bad... O

I O
think O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
recommend B-TARGET
is O
ice O
cream. O

It's O
a O
large O
tea B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
and O
I O
think O
it's O
just O
tea O
brewing. B-TARGET

They O
may O
be O
quality, O
but O
I O
don't O
think O
they're O
paying O
attention O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
time B-TARGET
they're I-TARGET
brewing I-TARGET
or O
the O
temperature. O

I'd O
expect O
something O
better O
for O
a O
bag O
of O
tea. O

They B-TARGET
can O
come O
for O
dessert. O

Miss B-TARGET
Pizza I-TARGET
isn't O
very O
good, O
but O
she's O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
Istanbul. O

They O
don't O
let O
us O
out, O
they O
say B-TARGET
we I-TARGET
don't I-TARGET
have O
room O
when O
it's O
empty, O
they O
say O
we O
haven't O
opened O
up O
since O
we O
left O
a O
little O
before O
noon, O
etc... O

It's B-TARGET
a O
place B-TARGET
I O
wouldn't O
be O
if O
I O
didn't O
have O
a O
bad O
meal. O

Such O
service B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
good I-TARGET
quality I-TARGET
does O
not O
suit O
you. O

The O
materials B-TARGET
are O
not O
very O
good, O
but O
they're O
above O
average, O
and O
they O
make O
the O
dough B-TARGET
quite O
well. O

The O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
very O
satisfying O
and O
diverse. O

It's O
a O
good O
alternative O
for O
people O
who O
want O
to O
taste O
different O
flavors. B-TARGET

Especially O
the O
pumpkin B-TARGET
pizza. I-TARGET

It's O
a O
place O
where O
I O
think O
they're O
having O
some O
serious O
trouble O
with O
the O
service. B-TARGET

There's O
always O
a O
problem. O

The B-TARGET
employees I-TARGET
really O
don't O
mind O
their O
noses. O

I've O
been O
back O
a O
lot. O

Your O
view B-TARGET
is O
very, O
very O
beautiful. O

Although O
it's O
from O
certain O
places O
in O
Istanbul O
for O
fish O
in O
the O
straits, O
I O
think O
it O
might O
be O
a O
little O
more O
delicious B-TARGET
for O
a O
view I-TARGET
like O
this. O

Prices B-TARGET
are O
high, O
but O
there's O
a O
price O
for O
real O
fish O
in O
the O
throat, O
and O
it's O
not O
right O
to O
talk O
about O
prices O
because O
of O
ambience B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
position. I-TARGET

For O
a O
romantic B-TARGET
dinner I-TARGET
with O
fish O
in O
the O
throat... O

We O
tried O
Happy O
moon's O
burgers O
and O
regular O
burgers. O

At O
first, O
we O
waited O
for O
the O
dirty O
hour O
sauces B-TARGET
we O
wanted O
because O
all O
the O
sauces O
were O
being O
used O
by O
others. O

My O
question O
is, O
how O
hard O
can O
it O
be O
to O
find O
a O
six-top O
mayonnaise, B-TARGET
or O
how O
little O
can O
it O
cost? O

As O
for O
the O
food, O
we O
didn't O
like O
it. O

When O
we're O
done O
eating, O
let's O
get O
up. O

Aren't O
you O
taking O
anything O
else? O

When O
do O
you O
get O
up? O

It's O
looked O
at O
with O
a O
goose's O
eye O
that's O
going O
to O
be O
sent O
to B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
shop I-TARGET
without O
lengthening O
it. O

I O
don't O
know O
if O
I O
have O
any O
dissatisfaction. O

A O
fertile O
place B-TARGET
is O
on O
a O
weekday, O
Saturday's O
tail O
is O
at O
the O
door. O

But O
once O
I O
told O
the O
waiter O
about O
the O
cold O
soup, O
he O
didn't O
like O
it. O

Looks O
like O
there's B-TARGET
a O
fill-up O
on O
the O
house. O

Whispers O
say O
they're O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
on O
the O
European O
side. O

I O
think O
it's O
the O
best O
lavage B-TARGET
there O
is. O

Looks O
like O
he's O
feeding B-TARGET
her O
a O
lavage. I-TARGET

I'm O
not O
too O
wrapped O
up O
in O
it. O

Everything B-TARGET
else O
was O
fine, O
except O
for O
its O
most O
important O
feature, O
its O
rotation. I-TARGET

Pre-dinner O
treats, B-TARGET
waiters' B-TARGET
attention I-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
speed I-TARGET
were O
good. O

But O
his O
return B-TARGET
wasn't O
what O
he O
was O
praised O
for. O

The O
view's O
great, O
there's O
nothing O
else O
that's O
cool. O

All O
the O
other O
flavors B-TARGET
are O
standard. O

I O
think O
it's O
expensive O
at O
the O
prices B-TARGET
that O
fit O
these O
flavors. O

The O
money O
for O
the O
scenery B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
added O
to O
the O
food. O

Although O
it O
was O
a O
good O
alternative O
to O
eating O
home B-TARGET
food O
in O
the O
Tunnel O
and O
delicious, O
it O
didn't O
give O
me O
a O
good O
sense O
of O
comfort, B-TARGET
because O
it's O
a O
very O
small O
table, O
and O
you're O
probably O
sharing O
your O
table O
with O
others. O

You O
can O
still O
go O
once O
a O
month. O

The B-TARGET
olive I-TARGET
oil I-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is O
very O
successful, O
and O
there O
are O
different O
flavors B-TARGET
instead O
of O
classic O
food O
everywhere. O

And O
they O
serve O
in O
plenty O
of O
caps, O
and O
you O
pay O
13-14tl B-TARGET
for O
the O
5-cesit O
olive O
oil. O

Especially O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in B-TARGET
summer, I-TARGET
but O
unfortunately O
it's O
a O
small O
place, O
so O
it's O
hard O
to B-TARGET
find I-TARGET
a O
place, O
but O
it's O
not O
impossible O
if O
you O
wait O
just O
a O
little O
bit. O

It's O
a O
great O
view. B-TARGET

She's O
in O
a O
really O
good O
position. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
fast. O

Every O
time O
we O
go, O
we O
leave O
with O
a O
smile. O

And O
the O
meatballs B-TARGET
are O
delicious. O

It's O
like O
a O
little O
surprise O
in O
a O
green O
garden O
where O
you O
walk O
through O
a O
small O
door O
in O
the O
crowded O
alleys O
of O
my O
taxi: O

We O
love B-TARGET
it I-TARGET
here. I-TARGET
It's O
so O
romantic. O
It's O
so O
sweet. O

The O
only O
flaw O
is O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
a O
little O
closer O
together. O

We B-TARGET
preferred O
red O
lemonade O
and O
lemon B-TARGET
vitamins, I-TARGET
and O
we O
loved O
them O
both. O

Make O
sure O
you O
come O
and O
see. O

Because O
the O
view B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
perfect O
for O
the O
sea. O

The B-TARGET
garden O
is O
peaceful. O

I B-TARGET
don't O
think O
I O
can O
say O
the O
same O
for O
the O
inside. O

Self B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
is O
boring. O

On O
the O
one O
hand, O
you O
don't O
have O
any O
good O
waiters B-TARGET
following O
you O
around. O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
sit O
down O
to O
get O
some O
air. O

It's O
too O
crowded, O
so O
it's O
not O
much O
of O
a O
conversation, O
but O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
nice, O
the O
interior O
smells O
really O
good. O

But O
because O
of O
the O
crowd O
and O
the O
noise, O
we O
couldn't O
stay O
very O
long. O

We're O
looking O
for O
your O
old O
performance O
-- O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
I've O
been O
addicted O
to O
the O
beginnings, O
but O
it's O
been O
pretty O
low O
lately. O

Perfect O
for O
eating O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
but O
lost O
the O
flavor B-TARGET
when O
it O
first O
opened. O

The O
best-positioned B-TARGET
teacher's O
home! O

- O
The O
Sabaci O
School, O
right O
next O
to O
the O
Anatolian O
Citadel, O
is O
a O
facility B-TARGET
that O
is O
open O
to O
everyone's O
use. O

In O
total, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
receive O
affordable B-TARGET
services O
from O
four O
halls O
and O
a O
cafeteria O
facility, O
and O
to O
perform O
events O
such O
as O
weddings, O
Aprils, O
school O
dinners, O
meetings. O

Although O
the O
cafeteria's O
self-service B-TARGET
may O
seem O
a O
negative, O
tea O
in O
Bogaz O
is O
not O
to O
be O
discussed! O

Okay, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
rice B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
cold O
and O
the O
beans O
are O
cold! O

Of O
course, O
it's O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
so O
it's O
a O
lot O
of O
service, B-TARGET
so O
it's O
a O
lot O
of O
work. O

I O
went O
once, O
I O
won't O
go O
again. O

You O
know, O
when O
you O
have O
places O
where O
they B-TARGET
combine O
you O
with O
pleasant O
conversation, O
and O
they O
give O
you O
a O
taste O
of O
what O
they O
leave O
behind. O

It's O
one O
of O
those O
addresses! O

Sunday B-TARGET
breakfasts I-TARGET
are O
my O
master's. O

Where O
I O
heard O
your O
reputation O
and O
went, O
but O
when O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
came, O
there O
was O
no O
fame O
left. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the B-TARGET
fact I-TARGET
that O
it's O
the O
money O
that O
comes O
in O
and O
works O
on O
the O
account B-TARGET
and O
then O
it's O
the O
money O
that's O
working O
on O
the O
bet. O

I O
don't O
like O
it. O

I O
don't O
know O
if O
it's O
us, O
but O
I O
ate O
the O
worst O
food B-TARGET
I've O
had O
in O
a O
long O
time, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
really, O
really O
bad. O

There's O
nothing O
special O
about O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

It's O
one O
of O
those O
typical O
places B-TARGET
where O
they're O
copies O
of O
each O
other, O
trying O
to O
rip O
off O
customers I-TARGET
with O
standard O
cafe I-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

It's O
a O
very O
beautiful O
bar O
on O
the O
fort, O
and O
they've O
done O
a O
great O
interior B-TARGET
design, I-TARGET
but O
it's O
a O
little O
cold O
in O
the O
winter B-TARGET
months: I-TARGET

(They O
can't O
heat O
up O
enough O
because O
the O
four O
sides O
are O
glass. O

It's O
also O
nice O
that O
they O
have O
an O
unlimited O
foreign O
alcoholic B-TARGET
event O
for O
Christmas: O

I O
don't O
like O
your O
burger, O
but O
maybe O
the O
other O
food B-TARGET
will O
be O
delicious. O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
that's O
always O
crowded. O

College O
kids O
come O
by O
a O
lot. O

One O
of O
the O
favorite O
places B-TARGET
in O
Kadıköy O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
tea, O
the O
first O
thing B-TARGET
that O
comes O
to O
mind O
is: O

) O
You O
will O
surely O
love O
one O
of O
the O
nearly O
60 O
different O
kinds O
of O
tea: B-TARGET

I O
like O
caramel-seeking B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
so O
much O
that O
even O
though O
I O
don't O
remember O
its O
name, O
when O
you O
say O
there's O
caramel O
in O
it, O
it's O
the O
only O
one O
that'll O
come: O

You O
don't O
want O
to O
get O
up O
from O
the O
seats O
on O
the O
inside. O

It's O
definitely O
a O
place B-TARGET
that O
deserves O
my O
points. O

He's O
got O
a O
cute O
little O
concept. B-TARGET

Pizza B-TARGET
Fagotto I-TARGET
is O
my O
favorite O
flavor, O
and O
it's O
the O
best O
pizza O
for O
me O
until O
I O
eat O
better. O

I O
used O
to O
love O
eggplant O
stew O
kebabini... O

I O
went O
nearby, O
the O
service B-TARGET
sucks. O

The O
price B-TARGET
is O
high, O
the O
card O
doesn't O
pass... O

Still, O
sorbet B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
is O
good. O

Try O
the O
Castle B-TARGET
Biryan I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
close O
to O
the O
Restricted. O

Just O
call O
ahead, O
see O
if O
there's O
any O
left. O

He's O
coming O
to O
your O
table O
with B-TARGET
a O
special O
presentation. O

Mushroom B-TARGET
bowls I-TARGET
can O
also O
be O
tested. O

Great O
scenery, B-TARGET
good O
flavors B-TARGET
- O
the O
landscape O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
very O
good, O
there's O
all O
kinds O
of O
food, O
and O
they're O
very, O
very O
good O
prices. B-TARGET

It's O
very O
nice O
to B-TARGET
have I-TARGET
it O
public. O

It's O
one O
of B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
places I-TARGET
to O
go, O
even O
though O
it's O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
and O
it's O
hard O
not O
to O
find O
a O
place. I-TARGET

Although O
it's O
the O
largest O
place B-TARGET
in O
Hisarustu, O
it's O
not O
very O
spacious. O

It's O
good O
for O
the O
crowd, O
and O
it O
gives O
a O
huge O
advantage O
from O
the O
pain. O

It'll B-TARGET
be I-TARGET
a O
good O
bistro O
in O
an O
hour. O

It's O
nice O
that O
summer O
is B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
camera, I-TARGET
but O
we're O
frozen O
in O
winter. O

I O
don't O
know O
if O
it's O
the O
first O
time O
it's O
been O
cut O
off, O
but O
the O
water O
was O
running O
down O
our O
throats. O

They B-TARGET
had O
their O
own O
beer, O
they O
had O
their O
own O
beer, O
they O
had O
their O
own O
beer, O
they O

If O
you O
want, O
you O
can O
get O
them O
in O
little O
glasses B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
different O
beers O
to O
try O
them O
on. O

It's O
a O
pleasant O
environment, B-TARGET
and O
it's O
not O
very O
crowded, O
it's O
recommended. O

I'd O
say O
there's O
hardly O
a O
bar O
in O
Kadiköy O
that O
I O
haven't O
been O
to. O

Alcohol B-TARGET
diversity, O
food, B-TARGET
decoration, B-TARGET
bartender, B-TARGET
as O
a O
customer B-TARGET
profile, I-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
place O
for O
me O
in O
Kadiköy. O

I O
don't O
think O
you'll O
find O
the B-TARGET
company's B-TARGET
hospitality, O
even O
the O
owner's B-TARGET
sincerity O
anywhere O
else. O

It's O
always O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
go. O

But O
on O
game O
day, O
you O
have O
to O
make O
reservations O
a O
day O
early. O

It's O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
place O
on O
game O
day. O

Kadiköy's O
bone O
place. B-TARGET

You O
can O
always O
find O
the O
classic O
quality. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
place O
you O
can O
choose O
for O
your O
weekend B-TARGET
breakfast. I-TARGET

I O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
leave O
in O
Ramadan, O
a O
nice, O
smooth O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
green. O

They O
hosted O
a O
beautiful O
music B-TARGET
banquet O
before O
and O
after. O

As O
far O
as O
food B-TARGET
is O
concerned, O
I O
won't O
be O
very O
positive. O

I O
eat O
much O
more O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
at O
the O
same O
price O
in O
this O
city. O

There's O
no O
one O
who O
doesn't O
know O
the O
place. B-TARGET

A O
unique O
view B-TARGET
of O
the O
girl's O
tower, O
after O
becoming O
famous, O
of O
course O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
flavor I-TARGET
is O
dropping O
like O
everywhere O
else. O

Every O
place O
in O
the O
world O
is O
like O
that. O

When O
I O
call O
him O
on O
the O
phone, O
he O
says O
we O
can't O
get O
a O
reservation, O
and O
when O
I O
get O
there, O
he's O
got O
a O
bunch O
of O
smart-ass O
waiters O
who O
don't O
sit O
at O
the O
table O
I O
want O
and O
say, O
"That's O
a O
reservation, O
sir." O

Big O
Chefs O
may O
be O
full O
of O
confidence O
and O
no O
competition O
in O
his O
neighborhood, O
but O
if O
they O
go O
like O
this, O
they O
lose O
a O
lot O
of O
customers. B-TARGET

I O
loved O
your O
burgers, B-TARGET
but O
my O
last O
experience O
didn't O
make O
me O
happy. O

I'll O
give O
you O
one O
more O
chance. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
sometimes O
good, O
sometimes O
bad. O

Place B-TARGET
design's I-TARGET
good. O

We O
ordered O
Chicken O
Bells O
and O
Pumpkin O
Sweets O
with O
a O
cute O
little O
crisis O
at O
the O
office. O

They're B-TARGET
both O
delicious. O

In O
fact, O
I O
think O
I've O
had O
the O
most O
delicious O
chicken B-TARGET
breast I-TARGET
I've I-TARGET
ever O
had. O

I O
wish O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
take O
a O
picture. O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
quick O
service, B-TARGET
by O
the O
way. O

That's O
the O
only O
way O
the O
sweet B-TARGET
crisis O
could've O
hit O
the O
field. O

The O
place O
was O
made O
up O
of O
both O
departments O
as O
a O
safety O
mah O
caf O
and O
a O
restaurant. O
I O
tried O
them O
both. O
It O
was O
a O
pretty O
nice O
place O
in O
general. O

If O
there's O
any O
food O
that's O
really O
not O
special, O
where O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
room, B-TARGET
where O
there's O
a O
very O
fucked-up O
weather-free O
normal O
place I-TARGET
where O
there's O
a O
demand O
for O
it, O
if O
there's O
a O
very O
high O
quality O
of O
prices, O
friends, O
tell O
me. O

Must O
be O
hard O
to O
find O
a O
restaurant O
this O
bad O
with O
services B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

You O
can't O
beat O
bad O
kebabs, B-TARGET
smart-ass O
waitress, O
and O
pay O
at O
the O
most O
luxurious O
restaurant O
at O
the O
price B-TARGET
of O
alcoholic O
food. O

The O
city O
must O
immediately O
cancel O
the O
registration O
of O
this O
establishment. B-TARGET

Just O
leave O
the O
whole O
thing O
alone. O

You're O
afraid O
the O
last O
wave O
of O
ships O
might O
get O
you O
wet. O
You've O
had O
enough O
coffee O
to O
watch O
the O
view, B-TARGET
the O
throat. O

I O
just O
don't O
think O
the O
view B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
positive. O

That's O
if O
you O
can O
find O
a O
place. B-TARGET

His O
employees B-TARGET
are O
very O
rude. O

He O
can O
keep O
you O
in O
line O
for O
hours O
and O
let O
others O
in O
front O
of O
you. O

I O
like O
his O
Passion B-TARGET
Fruit I-TARGET
ice O
cream O
and O
his O
drink. B-TARGET

I O
think O
her O
lover B-TARGET
has O
a O
mediocre O
taste. O

Can O
I O
go O
again? O

I O
don't O
know. O

It's O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
price B-TARGET
for O
your O
bane I-TARGET
is O
high. O

By O
the O
way, O
the B-TARGET
portion I-TARGET
is O
quite O
large, O
enough O
for O
two. O

Because O
it's O
so O
juicy, O
it's O
already O
eaten O
with O
plenty O
of O
bread. O

I'd O
say O
if O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
for O
breakfast, O
especially O
in O
the O
perfect O
season, O
with B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
concept I-TARGET
of O
a O
perfect O
place O
for O
an O
indoor O
space, O
I'd O
say O
you'd O
like O
to O
come O
over O
here. O

No. O

If O
you're O
in O
especially O
good O
weather, O
you O
can O
wait O
quite O
a O
while O
to O
sit O
at O
their O
beachside O
table. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
small, O
but O
it's O
cute, O
and O
I've B-TARGET
never O
finished O
love-memnu O
before, O
but O
it O
tastes O
really O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
troubled, O
I O
didn't O
like O
it. O

And O
the O
famous O
dessert B-TARGET
I O
was O
talking O
about O
is O
21 O
tl O

Actually, O
we O
were O
fed O
up, O
but O
we O
also O
tried O
the O
potato B-TARGET
dumplings I-TARGET
from O
the O
hunger O
of O
our O
eyes, O
which O
was O
pretty O
good, O
but O
it O
didn't O
have O
any O
extra O
features. O

It O
smelled B-TARGET
a O
little O
bit O
like O
food O
in O
there, O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
had O
unnecessary O
negative O
energy. O

Hopefully, O
it's B-TARGET
just O
a O
negativity O
of O
that O
day, O
because O
I O
need O
to O
taste O
the O
barrel O
again O
on O
my O
palate. O

Prices B-TARGET
are O
fine. O

We're O
in O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
for O
breakfast O
around O
here, O
but O
that's O
not O
what O
happened. O

You O
could O
say O
it's B-TARGET
good. O

But O
the O
breakfast B-TARGET
options O
are O
poor O
because O
the O
so-called O
rich O
breakfast O
plate O
in O
the O
photo O
is O
your O
decision. O

If O
that's O
the O
rich O
one, O
what's O
normal? O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
we're O
very O
praised O
and O
we're O
curious, O
but O
we O
regret O
it O
again. O

You're O
so O
popular, O
it's O
so O
hard O
to O
renovate O
a O
bad O
place. B-TARGET

I O
thought O
I'd O
eat O
the O
famous O
mannemen B-TARGET
I O
couldn't O
understand O
picking O
out O
the O
tomato O
peel. O

How O
hard O
is O
it O
to O
peel O
those B-TARGET
shells? I-TARGET

Especially O
something O
you're O
named O
after. O

The O
sausages O
were O
overcooked O
in B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
sausage I-TARGET
egg. O

A O
place B-TARGET
where O
I O
vouch O
for O
everything. O

They're O
so O
good O
from O
their O
waiters O
to O
their O
cooks, O
you O
can O
find O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
food O
and O
plates O
you O
eat O
here, O
but O
you O
won't O
find O
it B-TARGET
anywhere O
else, O
brothers O
keep O
calm O
and O
eat O
from O
Happy O
Moons. O

It's O
a O
warm, O
friendly, O
shoplifting B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
famous O
for O
its O
name. O

The B-TARGET
semen I-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
the O
honey B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
but O
I O
can't O
make O
a O
positive O
comment O
on O
the O
tea. O

There's O
a O
restaurant O
across O
the O
street, O
but O
I O
tell O
you, O
go O
have O
a O
nice O
breakfast B-TARGET
with O
your O
mannemen O
and O
butterscotch. O

And O
the O
prices B-TARGET
are O
good, O
below O
average. O

Sampi, B-TARGET
though O
on O
the O
avatar, O
is O
where O
the O
bus O
travellers O
stop. O

They B-TARGET
have O
a O
variety O
of O
pita, O
more O
like O
a O
Black O
Sea O
pita. O

I O
think O
it's O
more O
than O
just O
going, O
I O
think O
it's O
going O
to O
happen. O

Happy B-TARGET
moon's I-TARGET
a O
disgrace. O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
very O
bad. O

Tasty B-TARGET
zero. O

The O
only O
unnecessary O
happy O
moon's O
without O
alcohol B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
can't O
fight O
you O
guys O
on O
the B-TARGET
street I-TARGET
where O
he O
is O
while O
you're O
eating O
at O
the O
table, O
and O
you're O
sticking O
with O
him. O

In O
the O
winter O
months O
- O
especially O
in B-TARGET
this O
log O
house, O
it's O
very O
nice O
to B-TARGET
drink I-TARGET
sahlea. I-TARGET

Aparatises B-TARGET
are O
perfect O
for O
your O
hunger. O

The O
place O
that's O
available O
in O
the O
narcissoid B-TARGET
is O
usually O
full. O

Even O
though O
it's O
supposed O
to O
be O
preferable O
for O
dry O
beans, O
the O
buttered B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
is O
much O
more O
natural. O

It's O
dry, O
it's O
really O
delicious, O
but O
I O
feel O
it's O
got O
fat B-TARGET
margarine I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
it. O

Little B-TARGET
bitter I-TARGET
peppers I-TARGET
with O
these O
flavors, O
I O
think O
they're O
the O
favorite O
of O
the O
table. O

When O
I O
first O
went O
to O
Longs, O
I O
didn't O
get O
a O
taste O
of O
it O
the O
second O
time O
I O
went O
to O
Longs... O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went, O
the O
delicious O
burrito B-TARGET
was O
a O
bust O
on O
my O
second O
trip, O
so O
we O
couldn't O
eat O
it O
because O
it O
was O
too O
fat, O
so O
we O
went O
hungry O
with O
our O
friends: O

I O
couldn't O
understand O
this O
carelessness O
because O
the O
place O
was O
crowded, O
even O
though O
it O
took O
so O
much O
credit, O
such O
a O
negative O
situation B-TARGET
seemed O
interesting. O

It's O
one O
of O
the O
most O
enjoyable O
places B-TARGET
to O
watch O
Istanbul. O

It O
calms O
the O
landscape B-TARGET
and O
gives O
it O
peace. O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
interested. O

You O
don't O
feel O
bad O
here B-TARGET
and O
you O
leave O
happy. O

Delicious O
food, B-TARGET
comfortable O
environment B-TARGET
and O
affordable O
prices. B-TARGET

His O
only O
problem O
is O
he's O
having O
a O
little O
trouble O
with O
transportation. B-TARGET

We O
don't O
know O
where O
we're B-TARGET
gonna I-TARGET
get I-TARGET
in O
our O
private O
vehicle, O
but O
we've O
reached O
the O
location O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
ten-minute O
effort. O

After O
dinner, O
you O
can O
resume O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
setting. I-TARGET

They O
also O
have O
episodes O
where O
you O
can O
play O
backgammon, B-TARGET
okay, I-TARGET
games. I-TARGET

It's O
convenient O
and O
convenient. O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
that's O
even O
more O
beautiful O
in O
the O
summer. O

You O
can O
be O
sure O
you'll O
go O
back O
to O
the O
pearl O
of O
this O
space O
sky O
where O
you'll O
have O
a O
pleasant O
time O
with O
your O
best O
friends O
at O
the O
big O
chef O
branch. O

It's O
a O
place B-TARGET
that O
saves O
the O
view. I-TARGET

I O
don't O
like O
it O
very O
much. O

And B-TARGET
they're I-TARGET
not O
very, O
very O
perfect. O

You O
could O
say O
it's O
okay. O

There's O
no O
guler B-TARGET
face. O

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
out O
there O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night. O

As O
long O
as O
you're O
sitting, O
they O
always O
bring O
popcorn. B-TARGET

If O
you O
don't O
stop, O
you O
can B-TARGET
eat I-TARGET
about O
10 O
bowls O
in O
an O
hour. O

They O
also O
had O
the O
last O
of O
the O
Premier B-TARGET
League I-TARGET
games. I-TARGET

There's O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
the B-TARGET
flavor I-TARGET
of O
the O
beans, O
and O
the O
prices B-TARGET
are O
reasonable, O
but O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
in O
the O
wedding O
room. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day, O
the O
bean O
maker O
can O
only O
make O
the O
environment B-TARGET
more O
enjoyable. O

The O
location O
of O
the B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
so O
perfect, O
the O
concept, O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
mediocre. O

- O
One O
side O
of B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Anatolian I-TARGET
fort, O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Göksu O
Creek, O
is O
the O
blue O
water O
that O
flows O
through O
the O
Istanbul O
Bogas, O
but O
that's O
it. O

I O
went O
at O
different O
times, O
but O
the B-TARGET
energy I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
location O
doesn't O
appeal O
to O
me... O

They O
must O
have O
regulars, O
but O
they O
don't O
get O
me. O

But O
tell O
me O
with O
a O
good O
operator B-TARGET
that O
if O
this O
place O
were O
to O
be O
handled O
well, O
you'd O
be O
doing O
a O
great O
job O
here... B-TARGET

As O
a O
location, O
it's O
actually O
in O
a O
very O
nice O
place. O

Maybe O
if O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
top O
half O
of O
the O
place, O
there's O
a O
good O
chance O
there's O
a O
view, O
but O
unfortunately, O
we O
didn't O
see O
anything O
from O
the O
car O
or O
the O
tree O
because O
we O
were O
sitting O
in B-TARGET
the O
parking O
lot. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
a O
Ramazan O
special O
app B-TARGET
in O
this O
parking O
lot. O

If O
you're O
going O
to O
leave, O
ask O
him O
specifically O
to O
be O
on O
the O
top B-TARGET
floor I-TARGET
of O
the O
place. O

It O
didn't O
taste O
very O
good O
about O
flavor. B-TARGET

If O
you O
think O
you'll O
go O
for O
the O
view, B-TARGET
it O
could O
be O
tried. O

It's B-TARGET
a O
pretty O
fucked-up O
place O
where O
the O
credit O
card O
doesn't O
apply, O
serves B-TARGET
the O
soup O
on O
a O
bowl O
of O
flat O
plates, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
in O
love, O
the O
meat O
is O
just O
a O
piece O
of O
meat, O
and O
I O
don't O
understand O
why O
it's O
so O
reproducable. O

Extremely O
bad O
service, B-TARGET
far O
from O
service, O
is O
staffed B-TARGET
in O
another O
world. O

Don't O
even O
imagine O
a O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
smiley O
staff B-TARGET
for O
a O
kebab O
player O
here. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
a O
big O
"0." O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
slow. O

When O
I O
asked O
the O
waiter O
if O
he O
was O
slow, O
there O
were O
500 O
people. O
I O
took O
the O
cvbin. O

They O
don't O
take O
five O
hundred O
people O
for O
the O
trick: O

I'm O
able O
to O
present O
it O
fast... O

I'm O
definitely O
not O
going O
to O
choose O
again. O

It's O
normal-- O
their O
pizzas O
are B-TARGET
thin O
enough, O
but O
they O
lack O
a O
specific O
taste, O
a O
place O
that O
doesn't O
have O
to O
go O
because O
it's O
not O
special. O

It's O
a O
terrible O
place. B-TARGET

It's O
a O
crappy O
place B-TARGET
with O
mean O
waiters O
and O
services. O

Except O
for O
the O
view, O
and O
the O
presentation B-TARGET
really O
sucks. O

We O
wanted O
to O
eat O
sweet, O
get O
up O
and O
sit O
somewhere O
else, O
the O
rudes B-TARGET
said. O

There's O
no O
need O
to O
be O
modest. O
There's O
no O
need O
to O
exaggerate. O

They're O
making O
the O
best O
turnover B-TARGET
in O
Istanbul. O

We O
don't O
appreciate O
quality O
flavor O
anyway. O

But O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
great. O
They're O
catching O
up O
with O
everyone O
at O
the O
250 O
store. O

The O
potatoes B-TARGET
next O
to O
the O
turntables, O
even O
the O
salad, O
they're O
great. O

Carrot B-TARGET
slices O
can O
also O
be O
tried O
sweet. O

The O
only O
thing O
missing O
is O
that O
they O
didn't O
make O
the O
buttermilk B-TARGET
themselves. O

A O
place O
like O
this O
requires O
handmade B-TARGET
buttermilk. I-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
there O
are O
tens O
of O
options O
on O
the O
menu, O
but O
unfortunately O
the O
food B-TARGET
isn't O
delicious. O

The O
place B-TARGET
deserves O
all O
the O
points. I-TARGET

It's O
a O
good O
choice O
if O
you'd O
like O
to O
have O
coffee, B-TARGET
but O
I O
can't O
say O
the O
same O
for O
dinner. O

I O
can't O
recommend O
small B-TARGET
pizzas I-TARGET
when O
large O
portions O
are O
just O
a O
regular O
portion. O

It's O
just O
a O
snack. O

It's O
a O
very O
small O
shop O
and O
a O
common O
area. O

The O
dough B-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
too O
thin, O
and O
the O
cheese B-TARGET
might O
be O
more O
abundant. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
unfortunately, O
is O
too O
weak O
and O
lowers O
the B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
level. O

Prices B-TARGET
between O
medium O
and O
high. O

Unlike O
most O
people, B-TARGET
I O
didn't O
like O
their O
own O
beer, O
and O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
I O
didn't O
even O
finish O
a O
beer. O

It's O
a O
little O
stuffy, O
especially O
on O
weekends. O

It's O
a O
nice O
and O
spacious O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
crowd. O

Other O
than O
that, O
although O
most O
of O
the O
time O
they O
don't O
meet O
the B-TARGET
demand, I-TARGET
the O
beer B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
they O
offer O
makes O
it O
very O
attractive. O

And O
his O
food B-TARGET
isn't O
very O
rich O
in O
variety, O
but O
it's O
delicious. O

From O
what O
we've O
tried, O
Chicken B-TARGET
Schnitzel I-TARGET
is O
perfect, O
Chicken O
Wrap B-TARGET
was O
great! O

And O
a O
variety O
of O
homemade O
ice B-TARGET
teas I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
lemonades I-TARGET
that O
are O
really O
successful: O

The B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
the O
servings B-TARGET
are O
amazing. O

Three O
people O
can O
eat O
what O
they O
bring O
for O
two O
in O
peace. O

If O
you O
tell O
them B-TARGET
to O
go O
get O
3 O
people, O
that's O
how O
the O
food O
comes, O
but O
they O
write O
70 O
tlls O
on O
their O
head. O
It's O
ridiculous. O

The O
ideal O
address O
for O
5 O
teas O
is O
in O
karaköy. O

With O
more O
than O
50 O
kinds B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tea, I-TARGET
he'll O
certainly O
catch O
your O
taste O
in O
something! O

My O
advice O
is O
a O
vanilla-flavored O
bourban B-TARGET
vanilla, I-TARGET
and O
for O
your O
sweet O
needs, O
a O
bubble O
gum-gum B-TARGET
mastica I-TARGET
cake. I-TARGET

The B-TARGET
service, I-TARGET
the O
attention, O
everything O
is O
wonderful! O

I'm O
glad O
I O
did, O
but O
I O
didn't O
say O
I O
ate O
anything. O

In O
fact, O
the O
other O
Gulluoğlu O
branches O
where O
I O
ate O
the O
same O
things, O
I O
thought O
they O
were O
fresh O
and O
delicious. O

There O
aren't O
many O
seats. B-TARGET

To O
be O
honest, O
it's O
weird O
how O
famous O
he O
is. O

People B-TARGET
who O
like O
the O
view... O

- O
That's O
the O
food B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
view, I-TARGET
it's B-TARGET
not I-TARGET
served: I-TARGET

(▪ O
Moreover, O
at O
prices, B-TARGET
it O
is O
not O
suitable O
compared O
to B-TARGET
their I-TARGET
food. I-TARGET

If O
you O
go O
for O
their B-TARGET
food, I-TARGET
you O
may O
leave O
unsatisfactory, O
but O
if O
you O
like O
landscapes, B-TARGET
you O
must O
go. O

If O
you're O
a O
fan O
of O
Istanbul, O
then O
don't O
hesitate. O

One O
of O
the O
places B-TARGET
I O
enjoyed O
going O
to O
Kadiköy. O

It's O
an O
English O
pub O
style, O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
beer. O

We O
tried O
schinitzel B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
burgers I-TARGET
for O
dinner, O
and O
it O
went O
well O
with O
the O
beer. O

I O
suggest O
that O
you O
sit O
inside O
in O
the O
winter, O
decorating B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the O
atmosphere... O

It's O
game O
days. O

You'd O
better O
get O
it O
done. O

Her O
decoration B-TARGET
colors B-TARGET
are O
so O
warm O
and O
lovely. O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
want O
a O
home-cooked B-TARGET
meal, I-TARGET
you O
need O
to O
know O
what O
to O
eat O
on O
one O
condition, O
because O
it's O
not O
all B-TARGET
very O
tasty. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
slow, O
and O
I O
don't O
like O
the O
way O
the O
staff B-TARGET
talks O
to O
each O
other. O

I O
guess O
when O
the O
place O
is O
crowded, O
there's O
no O
such O
thing O
as O
stress B-TARGET
control. I-TARGET

The O
Istanbul B-TARGET
branch I-TARGET
isn't O
very O
good. O
The O
music B-TARGET
they I-TARGET
play I-TARGET
is O
very O
popular O
with O
hard O
rock. O

The O
same O
concept O
service O
is O
good, O
but O
compared O
to O
the O
others, O
it's O
a O
little O
pricey O
for O
the O
promise O
and O
the O
payment. O

The O
backyard B-TARGET
takes O
all O
the O
fatigue O
out O
of O
you. O

The O
hedgehog O
of O
the O
best B-TARGET
track O
is O
a O
favorite O
place O
for O
dieters O
because O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
fit O
for O
healthy O
nutrition. O

The O
table B-TARGET
floors I-TARGET
aren't O
very O
nice. O
It's O
not O
a O
sit-down. B-TARGET

It's O
hard O
to O
find B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
place. I-TARGET

There's O
a O
lot O
of O
tea, B-TARGET
but O
the O
prices B-TARGET
are O
a O
little O
high. O

When O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
English O
tea, O
they O
didn't O
bring O
the O
milk, O
and O
they O
said O
you O
were O
bad, O
so O
the O
waiter O
even O
snapped. O

Don't O
tell O
me O
how O
different O
raisins O
can O
be, O
but O
we O
think O
it's O
a O
little O
sugary O
taste B-TARGET
from O
the O
beans O
I O
ate O
at O
the O
Kuru O
that O
really O
amazes O
me. O

Buttered B-TARGET
rice O
and O
pan B-TARGET
yogurt I-TARGET
are O
also O
very O
successful. O

Although O
honey O
and O
nuts O
were O
so O
tempting, O
I O
couldn't O
taste O
the O
rice O
pudding, B-TARGET
it O
was O
more O
like O
pudding. B-TARGET

And O
the O
different O
olive B-TARGET
oil I-TARGET
foods I-TARGET
they O
make O
every O
day O
are O
very O
successful. O

Prices B-TARGET
are O
slightly O
above O
average, O
unfortunately. O
