There's O
a O
roll O
sushi O
menu O
when O
it's O
an O
ogle O
ball. O

I O
wonder O
if O
33TL's O
in O
for O
a O
drink. O

I O
went O
a O
little O
while O
ago. O

But O
the O
price O
may O
have O
changed. O

It's O
very O
good O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

It's B-TARGET
beautiful O
out O
there. O

It O
was B-TARGET
delicious. I-TARGET

Our O
favorite O
Sushico B-TARGET
branch. I-TARGET

Its B-TARGET
garden I-TARGET
is O
so O
beautiful O
and O
spacious. O

The O
sushi B-TARGET
master O
is O
very O
resourceful O
and O
witty: O

) O
Even O
though O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
slow O
during O
the O
busy O
hours, O
we O
find O
it O
acceptable. O

The O
menus B-TARGET
are O
rich. O

Its O
prices B-TARGET
are O
slightly O
above O
normal, O
but O
it's O
still O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
sit O
comfortably O
to O
relieve O
the O
fatigue O
on O
the O
street. O

He's O
a O
wuss, O
but... O

- O
I O
like O
the O
size O
of O
everyone's O
pudding O
or O
where O
they O
eat O
the O
sweet O
milk. O

Last O
year, O
I O
went O
to O
a O
kinefe O
dinner O
once O
a O
week. O

My O
favorites O
are O
between O
knives B-TARGET
and O
hair, O
but O
the O
chicken O
is O
very O
successful O
in B-TARGET
fog I-TARGET
and O
other O
breads. O

I O
didn't O
eat O
cognac, O
but O
it's O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
they O
like O
to O
eat. O

Since O
the O
service B-TARGET
isn't O
good, O
I O
can't O
see O
them O
cooking O
michelin O
star O
food. O

And O
this O
time O
they O
brought O
a O
hot O
Coke O
because O
the O
fridge O
was O
broken O
in O
a O
35-degree O
summer O
fever. O

You O
go O
in O
here, O
from O
the O
reception O
to O
the O
pickle O
before O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
all O
in O
the O
carefully O
chosen O
place I-TARGET
and O
taste. O

You O
can O
pick O
whatever O
you O
want O
on O
the O
meat B-TARGET
menu. O
It's O
all O
the O
best O
it O
can O
be. O

Sweets B-TARGET
are O
just O
as O
great. O

Mr. O
Bethi, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
place, O
says O
hello O
to O
your O
desk O
every O
time O
you O
go O
there. O

There's O
nothing O
more O
to O
say. O
He O
wants O
to O
eat O
well, O
and O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
risk O
it, O
there's O
no O
one O
better O
than O
Bethi. O

It's O
especially O
appropriate O
to O
introduce O
the O
turkish O
cuisine, O
thanks O
to O
its O
ostentatious O
decorations B-TARGET
and O
incredible O
flavors B-TARGET
to O
entertain O
your O
foreign O
guests. O

Service B-TARGET
jeans, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
over-regulated O
and O
rumbling. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
lack O
of O
interest O
in O
waiters. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
cold O
and O
late. O

The O
only O
beauty O
is O
the O
Marina B-TARGET
view. I-TARGET

And O
I O
can't O
do O
the O
Caribbean B-TARGET
floors I-TARGET
without O
mesmerizing O
them. O

Stable. B-TARGET

- O
How O
do O
they O
manage O
to O
do O
worse O
sushi B-TARGET
every O
time O
I O
go? O

Don't O
expect O
too O
much, O
not O
as O
good O
as O
Quick O
China. O

One O
of O
the O
pioneers O
of O
this O
stream, O
but O
Quick O
China, O
I O
think, O
has O
got O
Sushico. O

Sushis B-TARGET
are O
successful O
again, O
but O
the B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is O
seriously O
broken. O

I O
think O
the O
cook O
quit. O

They're O
all O
very O
good, O
and O
they're O
all O
good O
food, B-TARGET
and O
then O
they're O
delicious. O

The B-TARGET
waiters' I-TARGET
service O
presentation O
has O
everything O
in O
order. O

Thank B-TARGET
you. O

To O
the O
Calisans O
and O
to O
you. O

Cem O
Boyraz O

Take O
a O
piece O
of B-TARGET
advice. O

Try O
the O
flavors B-TARGET
from O
one O
end O
of O
the O
table O
to O
the O
other, O
different O
from O
the O
confectionary O
kitchen, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
right. O

I O
could O
eat O
bowls O
of O
chocolate O
palace B-TARGET
pudding, I-TARGET
crème B-TARGET
brûlée I-TARGET
and O
crème O
brûlée. O

They O
can't O
get O
water O
out O
of O
it O
easily. O

If O
you're O
very O
hungry, O
I O
suggest O
you O
try O
a O
spin B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
rice. I-TARGET

It's O
just O
a O
branch B-TARGET
that O
can O
be O
sat O
on O
the O
terrace O
floor. O

There's O
no O
need O
for O
the O
other O
floors. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
employees I-TARGET
are O
very O
involved. O

The O
prices B-TARGET
are O
the O
same, O
so O
it's O
normal. O

You O
can O
have O
your O
dessert O
and O
your O
tea O
on O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

- O
We O
went O
to O
work O
with O
friends O
during O
lunch. O

He's B-TARGET
good O
with O
knives, B-TARGET
great I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
hair, O
the O
waiters O
are O
indifferent O
and O
the O
prices B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
high. O

But B-TARGET
you O
still O
have O
to O
go. O

It O
was O
the O
place O
where O
I O
thought O
the B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
was O
more O
delicious O
than O
the O
places O
in O
Iconia. O

He O
hasn't O
been O
the O
old O
Plain O
since O
the O
Virgo B-TARGET
branch I-TARGET
opened. O

He's O
better O
off O
in O
Basakşehir O
by O
far. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful. O

The O
employees B-TARGET
are I-TARGET
kind. O

It's O
a O
chain O
you O
can O
trust O
the O
flavor B-TARGET
of. O

Seafood B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
is O
delicious. O

Octopus, O
shrimp, O
squid, O
salmon O
smoked O
; O
whatever O
you're O
looking O
for, O
it's O
got O
an O
omon B-TARGET
fume O
; O
whatever O
you're O
looking O
for. O

Healthy B-TARGET
and O
light. O

Get O
up O
for O
the O
meeting O
and O
go O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Florya O
Lara, O
which O
is O
disappointing, O
depending O
on O
expectations. O

It O
looks O
like O
luxury O
from O
the O
outside, O
but O
it's O
now O
showing O
up O
as O
an O
outdated O
location B-TARGET
and O
the O
accessories B-TARGET
inside O
are O
looking O
into O
it. O

As O
for O
the O
food, O
the O
tasteless O
no O
salt, O
the O
meatloaf B-TARGET
was O
worse O
than O
Pınar's O
meatloaf, O
the O
red I-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
was O
slightly O
hard O
and O
depressed. I-TARGET

When O
we O
thought O
maybe O
kinefe B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
lack O
of O
cheese O
brought O
our O
disappointment O
to O
a O
higher O
level. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
llla O
kebabs, B-TARGET
I O
suggest O
you O
make O
other O
choices... O

I O
haven't O
been O
there O
in O
a O
long B-TARGET
time, O
and O
I'm O
glad O
I O
didn't. O

It O
was O
really O
terrible, O
and O
the O
two O
people B-TARGET
who O
came O
in O
were O
169tl. O

I O
don't O
recommend O
it, O
if O
you O
say O
"design," B-TARGET
it's O
already O
depressing O
and O
old-fashioned. O

We O
went O
to O
the O
100 O
lira O
fix O
menu, O
and O
8 O
people O
paid O
1,600 B-TARGET
tl, I-TARGET
1 O
big O
raki O
in O
total. O

Coffee B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
are I-TARGET
200 O
tl O
everywhere O
the O
tea O
is O
served O
and O
stay O
away O
from O
1,600 O
tl O
account O
holders O

If O
you O
can O
find O
a O
seat O
by O
the O
sea, O
the O
session O
is O
very O
pleasant. O

The O
place O
is O
too O
big, O
so O
the O
staff B-TARGET
can't O
keep O
up O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
keeps O
limping. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
very O
good. O

We O
found O
the O
defamation B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
too O
weak. O

If O
500 O
people O
don't O
get O
quality O
service, B-TARGET
I O
think O
there O
are O
better O
conditions O
for O
300 O
people. O

I O
don't O
recommend O
it O
in B-TARGET
Ramadan. I-TARGET

I'd O
say O
it's O
the O
only O
place O
that O
makes O
me O
like O
sushi, O
the O
employees B-TARGET
are O
so O
smiling. O

Such O
satisfaction O
at O
this O
price B-TARGET
is O
very O
rare. O

The O
place B-TARGET
isn't O
suffocating O
at O
all. O
It's O
pretty O
good. O

The O
relatives O
took O
us O
away. O

This O
place O
is O
a O
restaurant. O

Of O
course, O
meat O
food B-TARGET
is O
all O
so O
wonderful. O

I O
like O
the O
historic B-TARGET
building. I-TARGET

I'd O
say O
the O
perfect O
pair O
between B-TARGET
buttered I-TARGET
lentil I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
and O
knife. O

They O
got O
the O
same O
quality O
in O
each B-TARGET
department. O

They O
just O
can't O
do O
the O
spin B-TARGET
thing. O

A O
place O
with O
lots O
of O
people O
during O
service O
hours O
tells O
you O
you'll O
taste O
a O
different O
flavor O
as O
ambiance. B-TARGET

It O
can O
be O
thought O
of O
for O
different O
flavors. B-TARGET

It's O
not O
nice O
that O
chickens B-TARGET
were O
born O
big. O

You're O
getting O
a O
taste O
of O
water O
in B-TARGET
the O
rice. O

And O
you O
give O
me O
$9.5 B-TARGET
on O
top O
of O
that. O

Now O
you've O
had O
your O
fun O
with O
me: O

I O
don't O
prefer O
- O
I O
went O
for O
breakfast B-TARGET
on O
Sunday. O

I've O
been O
to O
the O
sub O
in O
April O
before, O
and O
I've O
had O
an O
amazing O
breakfast B-TARGET
and O
I've O
enjoyed O
it. O

But O
this O
time O
I've O
never O
been O
happy O
at O
the O
base O
in B-TARGET
Beoglu. I-TARGET

The O
view O
is O
of O
interest O
to O
the O
marina O
waiters, O
especially O
Mr. O
Aegean. O

But O
I O
think O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
kinds O
of O
things O
in O
the O
same O
place O
where O
you're O
drinking O
out O
of O
proportion O
to O
the O
price B-TARGET
of O
food. O
We're O
selling O
names O
a O
little O
bit. O

The O
location, B-TARGET
the O
view, B-TARGET
the O
taste... B-TARGET

I O
ate O
lamacun B-TARGET
with O
a O
friend O
of O
mine's O
insistence, O
which O
was O
the O
best O
lamacun O
I've O
ever O
had. O

The O
kebabs B-TARGET
are O
already O
enormous: O

I O
mean, O
from O
the O
simplest O
to O
the O
most O
difficult... O

They're B-TARGET
all O
great... O

And O
because O
it's O
a O
friend O
of O
non-smoking O
people, O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites: O

If O
this O
place O
was O
in O
New O
York O
City, O
you'd O
have O
to O
book O
dinner O
a O
year O
ago. O

Shiny O
halls, B-TARGET
smiling O
and O
clean O
waiters. O

No O
comment O
for O
the O
meat. B-TARGET

My O
favorite O
especially O
is O
the O
lamb's B-TARGET
arm I-TARGET
in O
the O
copper O
pot, O
so O
you O
can't O
eat O
it O
anywhere O
else. O

The B-TARGET
olive I-TARGET
oils I-TARGET
are O
great, O
especially O
the O
imams B-TARGET
are O
vibrating, O
so O
if O
you're O
not O
drinking O
alcohol, O
I O
suggest O
you O
drink O
the O
black O
buttermilk. B-TARGET

When O
it O
comes O
to B-TARGET
prices, I-TARGET
it's O
normal O
for O
a O
place O
like O
that, O
but O
if O
you're O
in O
Europe O
or O
America, O
you're O
gonna O
have O
to O
pay O
three O
times O
as O
much. O

The O
neighborhood O
restaurant O
has O
been O
in O
Sushico O
April O
for O
years. O

It's O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
can O
go O
to O
from O
time O
to O
time. O

Susis B-TARGET
don't O
always O
fall O
down O
at O
a O
certain O
level. O

Chinese B-TARGET
food's I-TARGET
not O
bad O
either. O

Egg O
rolls O
in O
the O
morning. O

It's O
the O
same O
quality O
in O
every O
department O
with B-TARGET
lunch I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
dinner. I-TARGET

I O
don't O
even O
see O
the O
need O
to O
compliment O
your O
desserts. B-TARGET

The O
summer O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
should O
be O
tested. O

I'd O
say O
the O
milky B-TARGET
sweets I-TARGET
are O
perfect. O

The B-TARGET
tea's I-TARGET
good. O

Even O
though O
most O
people O
don't O
like O
it O
back O
home. O

But O
her O
torture B-TARGET
isn't O
pretty. O

They O
can't O
do O
the O
sauce. B-TARGET

The O
yoghurt B-TARGET
you've O
got O
is O
nice. O

Sometimes B-TARGET
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
out O
there O
that O
don't O
seem O
to O
be O
necessary. O

It's O
a O
place O
that O
has O
solved O
the O
common O
flavor B-TARGET
and O
ambiance B-TARGET
paradox O
in O
the O
world O
of O
kebab O
and O
meat O
restaurants. O

Lahmacun B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
underwear O
are O
good, O
but O
their B-TARGET
fill I-TARGET
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
ever O
had O
in O
Istanbul. O

The B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
is O
very O
successful O
in O
materials, O
marination, O
cooking O
and O
presentation. O

Especially O
my O
favorite B-TARGET
peanut I-TARGET
kebab. I-TARGET

Katmer's B-TARGET
great, O
too. O

Ambiance B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
decoration I-TARGET
are O
meticulously O
designed O
in O
this O
place, O
where O
you're O
not O
attached O
to O
the O
menu, O
so O
you O
can O
order O
exactly O
what O
you O
want. O

The O
view's B-TARGET
great, O
the O
food's B-TARGET
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
amount B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
food O
is O
too O
few, O
and O
it O
certainly O
doesn't O
deserve O
that O
price. O

Happymoons O
are O
much O
bigger O
than O
the O
proper O
we O
servings. O

It's O
too O
hot. O
It's O
too O
crowded. O
It O
smells B-TARGET
like O
the O
sea. O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
certainly O
very O
well-behaved. O

They O
make O
good O
tea B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
dumplings. I-TARGET

I O
recommend B-TARGET
it. O

It's O
on O
the B-TARGET
left I-TARGET
when O
you O
enter O
Istiklal O
Street. O

It's O
an O
aura O
of O
all O
the O
places B-TARGET
by O
the O
sea, O
unless O
it's O
called O
Fenerbahce. O

I've O
loved O
enjoying O
this B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
ever O
since O
it O
opened. O

Classic O
flavors... B-TARGET
