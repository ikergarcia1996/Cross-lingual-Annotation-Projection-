Highly O

The O

the O

one O
all O
the O

And O
the O
spectacular O
food, B-TARGET
that's O
why O
the O
good O
is O
paid... O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
saw O
was O
that O
I O
ordered O
some O
Provençal B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
and O
they O
charged O
us, O
so O
all O
right. O

Nothing O
special. O

I've O
been O
told O
wonders O
and O
it's O
okay, O
but O
that's O
all. O

The O
meats B-TARGET
are O
good, O
but O
like O
many O
others. O

The O
price, O
for O
what O
is O

for O
my O

is O
high. O

has O
already O
been O
one O
of O
the O
best O
experiences O
we O

in O

The O

very O

the O

of O

at O
the O

The O

prices O
and O
you O
can O
well O
make O
a O
higher O

depending O
on O

the O

We'll O
be O

Fabulous, O
very O

excellent O

and O
a O
great O

My O
friends O
were O
delighted O

so O
were O
we. O

It's O
worth O
it O
to O
go O
and O
taste O
their O
meats. B-TARGET

The O

is O
beautiful, O

We've O
been O
to O
the O

never O

The O
quality O
of O
the O

the O
excellent O

and O
its O
good O

makes O
it O
a O

We'll O
definitely O

excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
high O

We O
loved O
it! O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
everything O

very O
well; O
service, B-TARGET

all O

We've O
been O
to O

and O
the O
truth O
is, O
we O
loved O
it. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice O
the O
great O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
unbeatable O
deal. B-TARGET

fully O
recommended O

It O
has O
been O
all O
excellent, O
the O
quality, O
the O

the O

(perhaps O
too O
enlightened) O
and O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
milk B-TARGET

is O
divine. O

First O
visit O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
satisfactory O
results. O

Quality, O
professionalism O
and O
price O
according O
to O
the O
offer. O

Almost O
like O
in O
Argentina. O

Fantastic!!! O

Delicious!!! O

Fantastic O
resaturant B-TARGET
with O
excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
even O
better O
service!!!! B-TARGET

tremendous O
kindness, B-TARGET
it's O
a O

Very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
little O
plates O
are O
missing O
for B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
bread, I-TARGET
but O
despite O
that, O
all O
right. O

It O
would O
be O
good O
Argentine B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

Prices O
are O
within O
normal O

I O
was O
at O
a O
business O

yesterday O
with O
a O
customer O
and O
both O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

Congratulations!! O

A O
good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
although O
something O
expensive O
for O
the O
amount O
of O
food B-TARGET
served O
on O
the O
plate. O

The O
normal O
roast B-TARGET
strip, I-TARGET
nothing O
extraordinary. O

All O
right O
desserts B-TARGET
and O
kill. B-TARGET

Lighting B-TARGET
on O
the O
upper O
floor O
could O
be O
improved, O
too O
much O
flat O
light. O

Recommended O
100%. O

A O
beautiful O
place, B-TARGET
with O
an O
exquisite O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

The O
unbeatable O
service B-TARGET
and O
exceptional O
food!! B-TARGET

Exquisite O
salads B-TARGET
and O
meat. B-TARGET

Abundant O
food. B-TARGET

I'm O
sure O
you O
don't O
get O
hungry O
and O
excellent O
clairvoyance. O

The O
quality O
of O
meat B-TARGET
is O
insurmountable O
and O
I O
want O
to O
highlight O
the O
excellent O
service B-TARGET
received. O

If O
you O
haven't O
tasted O
their O
meat B-TARGET
you're O
missing O
something O
very O
big! O

I O
was O
having O
dinner O
with O
some O
friends O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
waitress's O
deal B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

We O
will O
repeat O
for O
sure!! O

The O
best O
thing: O
to O
be O
advised O
by O
them B-TARGET
when O
choosing O
a O
dish. O

I O
loved O
it!!! O

I'll O
be O
right O
back! O

The O
restaurants B-TARGET
ate O
very O
well O
and O
also O
a O
charming O
and O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

We O
take O
Void O
and O
Entrañas O
(specialities O
known, O
among O
other O
things, O
for O
the O
softness O
of O
their O
flesh). O

In O
some O
moments, O
we O
came O
to O
wonder O
if O
what O
we O
had O
in O
our O
mouth O
was O
meat B-TARGET
or O
a O
piece O
of O
tire. O

Disappointing... O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
quality, O
super O
friendly O
and O
always O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

The O
very O
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

An O
unforgettable O
culinary O
experience. B-TARGET

Super O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET

It's O
all O
very O
good. O

intimate O
and O
quiet O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
good O
quality O
in O
meats. B-TARGET

The O
price O
is O
rather O
high O
but O
reasonable. O

Excellent O
menu, B-TARGET
exquisite O
meats, B-TARGET
delicious O
specialties, B-TARGET
intimate O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
very O
rich, O
but O
the O
place B-TARGET
extremely O
noisy O
(especially O
the O
top O
floor). O

There O
was O
a O
time O
when O
I O
wanted O
to O
leave O
because O
of O
the O
noise. B-TARGET

Little O
intimacy. B-TARGET

Maybe O
good O
for O
group O
dinners, O
but O
couples O
abstain. O

Local B-TARGET
almost O
perfect, O
impeccable O
cuisine, B-TARGET
quantity O
more O
than O
abundant, O
extensive O
menu B-TARGET
(food O
and O
wines) O
and O
price O
suitable O
to O
what O
you O
offer. O

Highly O
recommended, O
therefore. O

As O
a O
caveat, O
I O
will O
say O
that, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
head B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
room O
(or O
owner, O
something O
I O
do O
not O
know), O
attentive, O
educated O
and O
detailed, O
the O
rest B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
service, O
cordless O
pings O
included, O
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
rest, O
more O
in O
terms O
of O
education O
and O
forms O
than O
to O
the O
ability: O
it O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
take O
care O
of O
aspects O
such O
as O
removing O
almost O
to O
the O
race O
dishes O
without O
finishing, O
tuning O
by O
default O
or O
offering O
the O
silence O
as O
any O
answer O
to O
the O
doubt O
of O
the O
diner O
in O
the O
choice O
between O
two O
options. O

It's O
a O
shame O
that O
successfully O
investing O
in O
the O
complicated O
(local, B-TARGET
raw O
material, B-TARGET
image, B-TARGET
website) B-TARGET
overlooks O
the O
basics: O
a O
couple O
of O
disgruntled O
waiters B-TARGET
that O
lower O
a O
customer's O
grade O
from O
an O
excellent O
to O
a O
remarkable O
high. O

It O
was O
a O
perfect O
dinner, O
for O
the O
place B-TARGET
and O
especially O
for O
the O
food. B-TARGET

They O
have O
a O
rather O
extensive O
card B-TARGET
where O
each O
dish O
looks O
better O
than O
the O
previous O
one. O

For O
meat O
lovers O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
order O
the O
Chef's B-TARGET
Solomon, I-TARGET
exquisite. O

<->Although O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
of O
quality O
the O
price O
is O
high O

The O
local O
and O
its O
situation O

I O
can O
only O
say O
good O
things O
about O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
ate O
very O
well O
and O
well O
taken O
care O
of. O

The O
shrimps B-TARGET
are O
really O
cool. O

A O
marvel O
as O
it O
is O
decorated. O

Very O
nice O
and O
with O
incredible O
views. B-TARGET

Of O
the O
food B-TARGET
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
say, O
but O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
touched, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
friendly, O
ultimately O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
is O
warm O
price B-TARGET
totally O
unbalanced. O

I've O
been O
to O
the O
restaurant O
several O
times. O

Very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

What O
I O
don't O
like O
is O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
last O
day O
we O
were O
asked O
for O
oysters B-TARGET
and O
we O
felt O
bad, O
apart O
from O
that O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
served O
the O
cava O
dripping O
all O
over O
the O
table...it O
will O
be O
a O
long O
time O
until O
I O
get O
back... O

We O
went O
on O
a O
Monday O
night O
in O
July. O

The O
only O
smile O
we O
saw O
among O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
from O
the O
girl O
who O
led O
us O
to O
our O
table. O

From O
there, O
serious O
faces O
(not O
to O
say O
in O
a O
bad O
mood), O
distracted, O
of O
waiters... B-TARGET
who O
sometimes O
waited, O
and O
other O
times O
pounced O
to O
liquidate O
the O
table. O

Covered B-TARGET
badly, O
without O
the O
slightest O
delicacy. O

Badly O
presented O
dishes, B-TARGET
flying O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
diners. O

Really O
bad O
service. B-TARGET

Decent O
food, B-TARGET
though O
in O
relation O
to O
price O
was O
not O
up O
to O
it. O

I'm O
sorry, O
but O
I O
don't O
recommend O
it O
under O
such O
conditions. O

Greetings O

It's O
not O
what O
it O
was...Ramon, O
it's O
come O
down O
a O
lot, O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
only O
thing, O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

Saturday O
past, O
at O
1 O
pm, O
few O
people, O
i.e., O
cooking O
without O
burden, O
paella, B-TARGET
simply O
unfortunate. O

It's O
a O
shame, O
it O
was O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona. O

Business O
dinner O
at O
more O
than O
50 O
€ O
pp O
and O
first: O
longaniza O
de O
vic? O

Maybe O
from O
Lidl; O
anchovies? B-TARGET

one O
or O
two O
pp; O
from O
second O
cod B-TARGET
to O
tiny O
flame O
with O
"dry" O
can/meat B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
fast O
food O
chips. O

For O
the O
price O
they O
could O
have O
been O
"fought O
and O
fried," O
right? O

Anyway, O
full O
of O
tourists B-TARGET
who O
come O
only O
once O
(from O
the O
cruises?) O

I O
don't O
care O
if O
the O
client O
comes O
back O
for O
it. O

very O
disappointed O
by O
the O
price B-TARGET
and O
quality; B-TARGET
before O
they O
were O
not O
so! O

It O
was O
a O
dinner O
for O
4 O
on O
Saturday O
was O
full. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
perfect. O

The O
delicious O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Over O
the O
years O
I O
have O
never O
been O
let O
down O
is O
a O
sure O
value. O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
data O
on O
the O
tab. O

The O
quality O
price O
ratio O
is O
also O
good O
around O
50 O
€ O
per O
person O
but O
for O
a O
perfect O
dinner O
I O
do O
not O
consider O
it O
expensive. O

Grilled B-TARGET
rice O
(for O
Guiris, O
it O
can O
be O
even O
good) O
and O
expensive O
in O
general. O

Very O
good, O
quality, O
service O
that O
justify O
its O
price. O

And O
vulgar O
nothing O
at O
all, O
quite O
the O
opposite. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
those O
who O
are O
able O
to O
appreciate O
and O
appreciate O
gastronomic B-TARGET
pleasure. I-TARGET

Personally O
this O
restaurant, O
already O
for O
the O
service O
and O
attitude O
of O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
the O
maitrê B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
I O
think O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
deserves O
a O
Michelin O
star, O
since O
it O
eats O
very O
well, O
they O
are O
great O
people. B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
the O
situation B-TARGET
is O
unbeatable. O

However O
the O
price O
is O
very O
high O
and O
over O
time O
it O
has O
gone O
up O
dramatically O
without O
improving O
the O
product. O

I O
don't O
recommend O
it. O

Expensive. O

Food's B-TARGET
always O
good. O

If O
it O
touches O
you O
near O
the O
luxury O
windows O
views. B-TARGET

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
your O
bartender B-TARGET
service. O

A O
bit O
chaotic O
reception. B-TARGET

As O
for O
the O
card, O
the O
bass B-TARGET
tartar, I-TARGET
supreme O
as O
well O
as O
its O
desserts. B-TARGET

We'll O
be O
back. O

Thank O
you. O

Optimal O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
and O
its O
elaboration. O

Excellent O
service. O

Unbeatable O
homogeneity. B-TARGET

You O
can't O
ask O
for O
more. O

I O
have O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
every O
time O
I O
travel O
to O
Barcelona O
and O
it O
has O
always O
been O
superb. O

I O
can O
only O
recommend O
it O
as O
it O
is O
undoubtedly O
one O
of O
the O
safest O
values O
of O
the O
Condal O
City. O

Impeccable O
service O
and O
you O
eat O
wonderfully! O

Good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
good O
quality O
in O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
only O
flaw O
is O
that O
it O
is O
very O
noisy O
and O
in O
some O
places O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
very O
close O
to O
each O
other O
and O
I O
think O
that O
for O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
they O
could O
have O
the O
most O
separate O
tables. O

Good O
grilled O
lobster B-TARGET

Perfect O
place. B-TARGET

Decent O
food B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service. O

To O
go O
and O
repeat. O

excellent O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service B-TARGET

It's O
a O
pass. O

The O
attention O
and O
care O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
its O
maitre B-TARGET
are O
worthy O
of O
award. O

A O
sure O
value. O

Catalan O
product B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
and O
mariner O
of O
a O
very O
good O
level O
and O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

A O
very O
homogeneous O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
will O
never O
disappoint. O

I O
repeat O
every O
time O
I O
can, O
with O
the O
family O
or O
the O
company. O

The O
attention B-TARGET
is O
exquisite O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
(fideua, O
rice O
and O
starters) O
of O
very O
good O
quality. O

The O
price O
is O
worth O
it O
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
is O
more. O

Highly O
recommended. O

It O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
offers O
quality O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
well O
cooked O
and O
with O
fresh O
elements. O

Good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
mediocre O
service. B-TARGET

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
for O
a O
birthday O
with O
friends O
and O
it O
was O
fantastic, O
a O
good O
deal B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
sirloin B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
3 I-TARGET
cheeses I-TARGET
and O
the O
hot B-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
over I-TARGET
apple I-TARGET
puree... O

Quality/Price O
:lifted, O
location B-TARGET
and O
very O
pleasant O
environment, B-TARGET
but O
inside B-TARGET
there O
is O
an O
excess O
of O
noise O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
not O
enjoy O
the O
food, O
I O
sincerely O
prefer O
others O
where O
I O
am O
more O
comfortable. O

A O
magnificent O
place O
to O
eat O
good O
seafood B-TARGET
and O
any O
of O
its O
rice O
or O
suquet, O
although O
highly O
recommended, O
would O
not O
recommend O
it O
for O
an O
intimate O
romantic O
dinner, B-TARGET
since O
the O
conversations O
of O
the O
neighboring O
ladies O
are O
very O
lively, O
since O
the O
local O
lends O
itself O
to O
it, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
of O
families O
or O
groups O
in O
general. O

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
magnificent O
views B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
value O
for O
money, O
always O
bearing O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
quality O
is O
very O
high. O

More O
than O
recommended. O

I O
have O
gone O
several O
times O
but O
the O
site O
is O
for O
tourists O
and O
although O
the O
quality O
is O
good O
the O
price O
is O
exaggerated O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
especially O
as O
regards O
reservations. O

I'll O
just O
go O
as O
a O
last O
resort. O

I O
find O
it O
a O
great O
place, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET

I O
was O
back O
at O

The O
first O
product, B-TARGET
excellent O

impeccable O

The O
natural B-TARGET
light I-TARGET
that O
enters O
through O
the O
window O
of O
the O

added O
to O
the O
cozy O

gives O
a O
feeling O

difficult O
to O

Anyway, O
I'll O
come O
back O

One O

my O

I've O

It O

what O
you O
ask O
for, O
you O
can O
eat O
very O
well O
without O
leaving O

the O
restaurant O

in O

a O
great O

in O

a O
plus. O

Great O
classic O
of O
the O
barceloneta O
with O
an O
unbeatable O
service!!! B-TARGET

Let's O
repeat! O

Excellent O
raw O
material B-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
setting O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
overlooking O
the O
Pier O
of O
Spain. O

Very O
friendly O
and O
professional O
service. B-TARGET

There's O
nothing O
more O
to O
see O
that O
it's O
always O
going O
to O
overflow. O

Without O
hesitation, O
we O
will O
return!!! O

I O
applied O
at O
the O
terrace O
reservation O
and O
I O
think O
I O
was O
at O
one O
of O
the O
best O
tables B-TARGET
with O
terrace. O

The O
very O
right O
service B-TARGET
in O
both O
care O
and O
education. O

Speed O
in O
the O
management B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
order O
and O
the O
quality O
according O
to O
the O
price. O

Maybe O
desserts B-TARGET
and O
wines B-TARGET
a O
little O
expensive. O

Orange B-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
€6 O
seems O
a O
little O
exaggerated O
to O
me. O

We O
ate B-TARGET
well, O
friendly O
service, O
they O
took O
2 O
plate O
a O
long O
time O
and O
I O
don't O
like O
that O
even O
though O
they O
remained O
in O
the O
paella O
and O
nideua O
more O
ratio, O
they O
took O
her O
without O
asking. O

I O
can O
only O
give O
a O
10 O
to O
your O
cuisine B-TARGET
of O
incomparable O
quality O
and O
freshness. O

The O
only O
hit O
or O
surprise O
was O
at O
coffee B-TARGET
time O
as O
they O
served O
me O
the O
same O
as O
at O
Burger O
King. O

of O
course O
10. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
acceptable, O
but O
the O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
decompensated. O
it O
would O
have O
to O
be O
explained O
to O
the O
cook, O
that O
the O
octopus B-TARGET
is O
not O
heated O
in O
the O
microwave O
and O
less O
if O
you O
put O
the O
paprika O
and O
oil O
as O
it O
burns O
and O
drys. O

The O
rest, O
passable O
and O
without O
further O
pretensions O
but O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
we O
were O
charged. O

very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
including O
parking O
cars, O
is O
all O
at O
the O
level O
of O
excellent O
quality. O

The O
service B-TARGET
ignores O
the O
letter B-TARGET
that O
also O
lowers O
the O
quality O
it O
used O
to O
have. O

Location O

Style O

Excellent O
raw O
material B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O

Attention. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
served O
at O
the O
right O
time. O

Good O
side O
of O
wine. B-TARGET

Local B-TARGET
with O
classic O
decoration O
and O
marinera. O

Too O
bad O
the O
weather O
does O
not O
accompany O
you O
to O
enjoy O
its O
pleasant O
terrace B-TARGET
with O
sea O
views O

We'll O
definitely O
come O
back. O

Good O
atmosphere O
overlooking O
the O
port, O
great O
food, B-TARGET
very O
rich O
rice, O
attentive O
and O
professional O
service. B-TARGET

Quality O
and O
good O
service, B-TARGET
are O
adjectives O

to O
describe O
this O
already O
classic O
in O
Barcelona. O

Couple's O
dinner O
at O
a O
special O
restaurant O
for O
us. O

Preparation O
of O
dishes, O
fish B-TARGET
in O
both O
cases, O
correct O
but O
presentation O
left O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

Service B-TARGET
so O
attentive O
that O
in O
the O
end O
becomes O
heavy, O
urgent O
to O
empty O
the O
dishes O
of O
the O
shared O
entrees O
wanting O
to O
continuously O
serve O
us. O

11:00 O
pm O
cooks O
start O
cleaning O
kitchen; O
the O
smell B-TARGET
of O
iron, O
fish O
and O
detergent O
invades O
the O
room. O

Nothing O
attractive O
desserts, B-TARGET
the O
same O
dessert B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
the O
last O
15 O
years. O

Too O
bad, O
I O
don't O
think O
we're O
coming O
back. O

As O
always, O
very O
correct O
service, B-TARGET
fast O
and O
excellent O
food. B-TARGET

Spacious O
dining B-TARGET
room. I-TARGET

Unbeatable O
views. B-TARGET

Customer O
service. B-TARGET

Family O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

It's O
an O
unbeatable O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Notable O
in O
general. O

Fish B-TARGET
and O
seafood B-TARGET
very O
fresh O
and O
tasty. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
at O
night, O
if O
time O
accompanies, O
great O
(asking O
when O
making O
the O
reservation) O

Very O
satisfying, O
I'll O
recommence O
this O
restaurant O
among O
my O
close O
friends. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
nice O
but O
"allowed O
to O
smoke" O
inconceivable O
in O
an O
area O
that O
said O
"terrace" O
and O
that O
was O
connected O
with O
the O
living O
room O
and O
with O
awnings O
lowered. O

That O
if O
I O
bothered O
they O
would O
change O
me O
table!!!!!, O
after O
so O
much O
time O
of O
application O
of O
the O
law O
I O
had O
to O
change!!!!! O

Despite O
being O
a O
fish O
and O
seafood O
restaurant, O
my O
husband O
found O
the O
green B-TARGET
pepper I-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
he O
ordered O
very O
good. O

The O
very O
good O
deal. B-TARGET

I O
asked O
for O
a O
table O
well O
located O
and O
they O
listened O
to O
the O
request, O
they O
gave O
us O
one O
with O
very O
good O
views. B-TARGET

We O
celebrated O
my O
partner's O
birthday O
and O
everything O
was O
perfect. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
with O
much O
patience O
and O
always O
present. O

From O
menu O
3 O
a O
good O
2oplate, B-TARGET
the O
first, B-TARGET
of O
pica-pica, O
a O
little O
poor. O

I O
selected O
the O
restaurant O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
and O
loved O
me O
and O
everyone, O
the O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
next O
time O
we'll O
order O
a O
little O
further O
away O
from O
the O
pq O
kitchen O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
fuss B-TARGET
in O
that O
area. O

I O
would O
have O
liked O
the O
glass O
shop O
in O
the O
first O
line, O
but O
when O
I O
booked O
they O
told O
me O
that O
there O
was O
no O
room, O
again O
it O
will O
be. O

In O
general O
everything O
very O
well O
and O
recommendable. O

They O
have O
a O
fast O
and O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

Good O
quality O
in O
products B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
good O
service B-TARGET
received. O

<->Nothing O
negative. O

Excellent O
reception B-TARGET
and O
addition O
to O
the O
table. O

Rapid O
attention O
from O
Maitre B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiters. B-TARGET

Suggestions B-TARGET
of O
excellent O
starters O
and O
main O
dishes, O
clear O
and O
concise. O

Everything's O
perfect. O

I've O
known O
him O
for O
years. O

Excellent, O
as O
always. O

Excellent, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Some O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excessively O
expensive O
considering O
the O
amount O
presented, O
but O
we O
have O
not O
been O
surprised. O

We O
ate O
at O
the O
Barceloneta O
today. O

As O
the O
forums O
and O
opinions O
say, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
price O
(food) B-TARGET
ratio O
is O
acceptable. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
has O
a O
totally O
excessive O
price O
(3 O
times O
the O
price O
in O
the O
store.) O

Regarding O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
place O
indicate O
that O
although O
the O
service O
is O
good, O
it O
seems O
more O
of O
a O
menu O
restaurant O
than O
a O
70 O
euros O
restaurant O
per O
person O
(fast, O
fast, O
fast). O

The O
distance O
between O
tables B-TARGET
is O
worth O
a O
menu O
restaurant. O

In O
geenral O
it O
is O
fine, O
but O
if O
you O
took O
care O
of O
those O
small O
details O
(especially O
the O
distance O
between O
tables) O
it O
would O
be O
superior. O

Perfect... O
as O
always... O

A O
good O
place O
to O
eat O
good O
seafood B-TARGET
and O
fish B-TARGET
in O
a O
privileged O
environment B-TARGET
and O
in O
a O
spacious, O
bright O
and O
pleasant O
place, B-TARGET
although O
somewhat O
noisy O
(it O
is O
very O
large). O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
comfortable O
(they O
park O
your O
car). O

I O
went, O
once O
again, O
with O
a O
friend O
to O
eat O
at O
Barceloneta O
Restaurant. O

Never O
let O
him O
down. O

Best O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
superbly O
crafted. O

It O
is O
always O
just O
as O
excellent, O
with O
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

A O
Chamber B-TARGET
Chief I-TARGET
who O
always O
remembers O
and O
greets O
regular O
customers, O
even O
if O
it O
has O
been O
months O
since O
they O
last O
visited O
the O
restaurant. O

A B-TARGET
sure I-TARGET
value. I-TARGET

A B-TARGET
"Blue I-TARGET
chip" I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
restoration. I-TARGET

It's O
hard O
to O
decide O
what's O
most O
remarkable, O
service, B-TARGET
food... B-TARGET

Atmosphere B-TARGET
a O
little O
charged, O
correct O
service, B-TARGET
good O
value O
for O
money. O

It O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places B-TARGET
that O
are O
still O
where O
you O
pay O
depending O
on O
how O
you O
eat. O

It O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
at O
least O
the O
quality O
is O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
price. O

I O
recommend O
it. O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
views. B-TARGET

As O
always O
excellent. O

We O
have O
had O
the O
idea O
of O
taking O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
the O
Day O
of O
the O
Orchard O
and O
the O
Kid O
and O
although O
they O
have O
offered O
us O
the O
possibility O
of O
other O
options, O
we O
have O
taken O
the O
one O
that O
we O
had O
thought, O
regarding O
the O
menu, O
nothing O
to O
object, O
everything O
perfect O
and O
according O
to O
expectations, O
the O
service B-TARGET
totally O
correct O
and O
diligent O
without O
falling O
into O
the O
heaviness, O
total O
a O
perfect O
evening, O
as O
to O
repeat O
and O
recommend. O

We O
went O
to O
try O
the O
cava O
menu. O

We've O
known O
the O
restaurant O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
so O
we O
thought O
we O
were O
on O
the O
safe O
side. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
what O
we O
ate O
was O
great, O
but O
we O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
quantity, O
which O
was O
rather O
scarce. O

We O
booked O
through O
the O
website O
and O
the O
menu O
did O
not O
disappoint O
us, O
we O
chose O
the O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
cabritillo O
and O
what O
we O
expected, O
good O
quality O
and O
quantity O
more O
than O
acceptable. O

If O
it O
could O
be O
a O
little O
cheaper, O
it O
would O
be O
perfect. O

Spectacular, O
already O
twice O
we O
go O
and O
I O
love O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
kid, B-TARGET
great. O

It's O
a O
shame O
not O
to O
run O
out O
of O
potatoes, B-TARGET
which O
on O
top O
were O
very O
good... O

From O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
very O
rich. O

It's O
worth O
it O
to O
go. O

Good O
food, B-TARGET
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
with O
great O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
roast. B-TARGET

Lately O
we O
have O
gone O
several O
times O
to O
the O
Chema O
Winery. O

The O
specialty O
of O
the O
restaurant O
(goat B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
potatoes) I-TARGET
is O
spectacular. O

It O
is O
also O
the O
only O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
eat O
with O
guarantees O
and O
great O
quality. O

Generous O
ratios B-TARGET
and O
closed O
prices O
without O
surprises, O
which O
is O
very O
rare O
today. O

That O
is, O
ratio O
quality O
price O
very O
good.Excellent O
starters O
(my O
weakness O
is O
poached B-TARGET
egg I-TARGET
). O

Don't O
miss O
the O
mojito B-TARGET
sherbet. I-TARGET

We've O
already O
repeated O
and O
we'll O
do O
it O
again. O

All O
right. O

We O
went O
six O
people O
for O
a O
family O
celebration, O
it O
was O
our O
first O
time O
there, O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
mushroom B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
we O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
everything O
very O
well O
cooked, O
reasonable O
quantities, O
some O
combinations O
of O
exquisite O
flavors, O
we O
were O
very O
satisfied O
and O
eager O
to O
return O
again. O

The O
service B-TARGET
went O
well, O
quickly O
and O
without O
problems. O

I O
hope O
that O
they O
will O
always O
continue O
to O
strive O
to O
overcome O
and O
give O
the O
highest O
possible O
quality, O
with O
reasonable O
prices. O

Dinner O
has O
been O
very O
pleasant O
to O
us, O
both O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
the O
presentation O
and O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
cava I-TARGET
too. O

We've O
been O
very O
comfortable. O

The O
value O
for O
money O
ratio O
is O
very O
good. O

We'll O
repeat. O

HAPPY O
YEAR O

Fabulous O
start O
of O
year O
with O
a O
great O
meal B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
stay O
both O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
pleasant O
treatment B-TARGET
received, O
as O
in O
previous O
times, O
we O
will O
repeat. O

Happy O
New O
Year. O

The O
food B-TARGET
the O
truth O
very O
good O
but O
the O
offer B-TARGET
that O
comes O
out O
here O
then O
is O
not O
the O
same O
from O
there O
I O
got O
5€ O
more O
expensive O
pers O
the O
menu. O

Hello O
Ursula. O

It O
didn't O
cost O
you O
more, O
what O
happened O
is O
that O
you O
ate O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
kid O
32 O
euros, O
not O
the O
menu O
of O
groups O
of O
27 O
that O
you O
booked O
(32-27=5 O
euros). O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
you O
went O
two O
people O
to O
take O
the O
menu O
of O
groups O
and O
that O
is O
not O
possible, O
for O
two O
people O
is O
available O
the O
32 O
and O
the O
36, O
and O
you O
served O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
32, O
and O
I'm O
very O
glad O
that O
you O
liked O
it, O
that's O
what O
happened, O
the O
important O
thing O
in O
any O
case O
is O
that O
you O
were O
happy. O

Say O
hello. O

The O
experience O
at O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
“La O
Bodega O
de O
Chema” O
has O
been O
a O
very O
pleasant O
experience O
for O
both O
me O
and O
the O
person O
accompanying O
me. O

To O
say O
that O
the O
attention B-TARGET
of O
the O
people O
working O
in O
this O
restaurant O
was O
kind O
and O
polite. O

All O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
to O
our O
liking O
but O
the O
baked B-TARGET
kid I-TARGET
was O
really O
spectacular. O

One O
point O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
is O
that O
at O
the O
time O
I O
applied O
for O
the O
account, O
this O
one O
had O
no O
increase, O
being O
exactly O
the O
amount O
that O
marked O
the O
menu B-TARGET
chosen O
and O
booked O
by O
the O
internet. O

Such O
has O
been O
my O
satisfaction O
that O
this O
is O
a O
place O
I O
have O
already O
recommended O
to O
several O
of O
my O
friends. O

I O
think O
it's O
a O
perfect O
thing O
to O
go O
as O
a O
couple O
as O
well O
as O
with O
friends O
and O
I O
think O
that O
no O
one O
who O
comes O
to O
dinner O
will O
be O
dissatisfied. O

We O
ate O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
at O
the O
restaurant O
last O
Saturday, O
the O
subject B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
and O
kid, B-TARGET
is O
great, O
balanced, O
good O
maybe O
too O
much, O
but O
we O
are O
good O
to O
eat O
and O
we O
know O
how O
to O
appreciate O
the O
good. O

They O
served O
us O
with O
agility, O
without O
waiting. O

The O
wine O
HEREDAD B-TARGET
“RED, I-TARGET
” O
delicious O
and O
pleasant O
to O
drink. O

It O
is O
interesting O
the O
price, O
including O
VAT, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
deserves O
it. O

Keep O
it O
up O
and O
you'll O
keep O
filling O
the O
dining O
room O
as O
usual. O

We O
went O
out O
enchanted O
from O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
unbeatable. O

I'm O
going O
to O
put O
it O
on O
the O
list O
of O
my O
favorites. O

Great O
kid. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
the O
detail B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
house I-TARGET
and O
the O
entrees, B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
a O
table B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cheeses I-TARGET
before O
desserts. O

All O
highly O
recommended. O

The O
food B-TARGET
very O
good, O
great, O
service B-TARGET
good, O
a O
little O
slow. O

He O
missed O
the O
house O
inviting O
a O
shot O
at O
the O
end. O

A O
rich O
menu. B-TARGET

I O
was O
delighted O
to O
be O
able O
to O
taste O
three O
starters B-TARGET
and O
choose O
a O
second. B-TARGET

Kind O
and O
professional O
service. O

A O
detail B-TARGET
to O
be O
able O
to O
take O
away O
the O
food O
that O
was O
left O
over O
(I O
was O
with O
an O
elderly O
person O
who O
did O
not O
eat O
much O
and O
they O
have O
put O
the O
leftover O
corvina O
in O
a O
container). O

Place B-TARGET
to O
remember. O

Great O
evening. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
dinner. B-TARGET

To O
highlight O
the O
kid B-TARGET
and O
the O
tangerine B-TARGET
sorbet, I-TARGET
simply O
delicious. O

The O
whole O
dinner O
watered O
with O
a O
great O

that O
we O
were O
recommended O
at O
the O

We'll O
be O
right O
back. O

Yesterday O
for O
Valentine's O
Day O
we O
ordered O
the O

to O
order O
(which O
can O

As O
always, O
fabulous, O
also O
with O
only O
heating O
the O

to O
180o O
for O
a O
moment, O
then O
heat O
for O
5 O

pour O

eat. O

I'll O
tell O
you O
in O

no O

knows... O

Perfect. O

We O
liked O
it. O

Excellent O
service. B-TARGET

Exquisite O
food. B-TARGET

Professional O
and O
very O
friendly O
treatment B-TARGET

I O
was O
last O
Saturday O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
I O
liked O
it O
very O
much.Modern, O
different, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
fun O
and O
original O
letter. B-TARGET

The O
mini B-TARGET
hamburgers I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ternasco, I-TARGET
Iberian I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
ox I-TARGET
already O
in O
case O
they O
deserve O
a O
visit. O

There O
is O
an O
important O
point O
that O
I O
did O
not O
think O
I O
read O
in O
the O
review: O
the O
closed O
menu B-TARGET
of O
30€ O
is O
for O
groups O
of O
at O
least O
8 O
people. O

I O
was O
on O
Saturday, O
February O
11th, O
and O
my O
global O
calipsing O
is O
good. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
great, O
great, O
it's O
rare O
in O
Zaragoza O
to O
find O
bars O
with O
such O
good O
music. O

The O
pity O
was O
that O
we O
went O
to O
dinner O
and O
it O
was O
not O
yet O
time O
to O
dance. O
Dinner, B-TARGET
regular. O

The O
acceptable O
quality, O
but O
the O
scarce O
quantity, O
were O
5 O
girls, O
and O
not O
very O
eaters, O
but O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
very O
small, O
especially O
the O
croquettes B-TARGET
and O
the O
fritters, B-TARGET
the O
presentation B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
attention B-TARGET
from O
the O
Waiters, O
unbeatable. O

The O
economic O
drinks, B-TARGET
and O
the O
Drag’s B-TARGET
regular I-TARGET
show. I-TARGET
In O
short O
I O
give O
you O
a O
good O
score O
but O
more O
like O
a O
drink B-TARGET
bar, I-TARGET
than O
for O
dinner, O
(good O
to O
pray, O
or O
peck), O
but O
don’t O
expect O
to O
be O
filled, O
to O
be O
spent O
a O
paston. O
I O
will O
come O
back? O

Yeah, O
but O
like O
dancing. O

Hello O
very O
satisfactory O
everything O
starting O
with O
the O
attention O
in O
the O
reservation B-TARGET
responding O
very O
attentively O
to O
the O
request O
and O
then O
very O
well O
both O
the O
deal B-TARGET
with O
the O
waiters O
and O
waitresses O
and O
with O
the O
level O
of O
the O
dinner B-TARGET
we O
have O
recommended O
to O
all O
our O
friends O
that O
they O
are O
not O
few O
and O
soon O
we O
will O
be O
there O
again O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
caraoke O
because O
I O
am O
singer O
and O
I O
think O
there O
is O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
An O
affectionate O
greeting O

Very O
well O
the O
deal B-TARGET
and O
at O
ease, O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
for O
dinner O
as O
a O
romantic B-TARGET
dinner I-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
incompatible O
with O
the O
theme O
of O
the O
performance, O
being O
at O
a O
table O
too O
much O
between O
the O
entrance O
and O
the O
bar O
bar, O
since O
when O
the O
friends O
of O
the O
artists O
arrived, O
and O
other O
clients, O
the O
intimate O
atmosphere O
was O
invaded, O
and O
it O
no O
longer O
spun O
too O
much O
to O
continue O
there O
eating O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
people O
drink O
drinks, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
to O
put O
you O
on O
a O
table O
in O
the O
background, O
without O
seeing O
the O
entanglement O
of O
people, O
than O
next O
to O
the O
stage O
and O
the O
entrance O

very O
rich O
dinner B-TARGET
and O
very O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

Thank O
you, O
see O
you O
soon. O

It's O
okay O
the O
truth! O

I've O
gone O
several O
times O
with O
young O
people O
and O
always O
have O
good O
criticisms, O
of O
course, O
without O
exaggerating! O

To O
be O
the O
street O
heroism, O
it's O
worth O
spending O
a O
day...that's O
right, O
I O
find O
it O
a O
little O
odd O
that O
Carlos O
has O
put O
in O
30 O
meters O
almost O
glued O
three O
businesses O
(heads, O
meccano O
and O
tingling)... O
along O
with O
things O
in O
common...I O
don't O
know, O
I O
don't O
see O
it, O
but O
he O
will O
know. O

If O
I O
told O
you O
that O
at O
the O
time O
I O
was O
a O
former O
client O
of O
this O
restaurant O
for O
saying O
something O
and O
I O
understand O
you O
I O
was O
a O
chef O
and O
finally O
a O
mess O
and O
that O
lasted O
a O
month, O
there O
was O
no O
gender, B-TARGET
I O
lacked O
everything O
and O
the O
child B-TARGET
(...) O

I O
took O
two O
pinchos O
in O
bar O
yesterday O
3-03-09 O
and O
found O
everything O
very O
regrettable. O

With O
the O
level O
that O
every O
day O
there O
are O
in O
establishments O
throughout O
the O
city O
(left O
margin O
included), O
it O
is O
shameful O
that O
it O
takes O
10 O
minutes O
to O
place O
2 O
pinchos O
tempering O
them O
in O
salamander O
and O
napando O
of O
rough O
way O
with O
simple O
oil O
of O
chives. O

WITHOUT O
VALUE O
THE O
BASES O
OF O
THE O
BAR, B-TARGET
the O
discussions B-TARGET
between O
kitchen O
and O
bar O
and O
the O
deals B-TARGET
with O
distributors O
and O
representatives O
without O
respecting O
the O
presence O
of O
“only” O
two O
customers O
in O
bar.They O
should O
also O
be O
happy O
to O
charge O
between O
3,5 O
and O
5,5 O
euros O
per O
pincho, O
but O
they O
are O
far O
from O
making O
good O
miniature O
kitchen. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
going O
to O
teresa O
brothers O
in O
san O
jose O
and O
evohe O
or O
jota O
in O
left O
margin O
to O
see O
what O
service, O
good O
product O
and O
originality O
deserve O
more O
respect O
than O
what O
La O
Despensa O
demonstrates. O

A O
pity, O
a O
pity... O

I O
was O
there O
yesterday. O

Never O
again! O

We O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
prices O
so O
high, O
3,5€ O
a O
croquette. B-TARGET

We O
were O
commenting O
on O
it O
as O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
letter O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
must O
have O
heard O
us O
and O
took O
the O
letter O
from O
us O
under O
our O
noses. O

We O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
waste, O
but O
no, O
they O
began O
to O
whisper O
the O
cook B-TARGET
and O
waiter, B-TARGET
criticizing O
and O
laughing O
at O
us O
and O
in O
the O
most O
brazen O
way, O
then O
they O
also O
mocked O
a O
gentleman O
who O
was O
next O
to O
us O
with O
his O
lady. O

And O
to O
top O
it O
all, O
they O
wanted O
us O
to O
swindle O
by O
charging O
too O
much! O

I'll O
never O
come O
back O
and O
I'll O
take O
care O
not O
to O
recommend O
it. O

It's O
disrespectful O
to O
laugh O
at O
people O
and O
more O
if O
they're O
your O
customers. O

They're O
rude. O

I O
was O
there O
last O
week O
and O
it's O
a O
pitiful O
place O
for O
the O
walkers, B-TARGET
one O
is O
the O
owner, B-TARGET
they're O
quite O
drainable O
the O
only O
one O
that O
works O
is O
a O
blonde B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
who O
does O
the O
impossible O
to O
please O
and O
cover O

remains O

very O

Nefarious, O
recommend O

your O

you O
don't O

You'll O
fuck O

I O
went O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
won't O
come O
back O
even O
if O
they O
give O
me O
the O
food. O

a O
disappointment O

I O
copy O

I O
already O
wrote O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
on O
another O
website O
behind O

also O
painful, O

I O
went O
with O
some O
friends O
who O
had O
given O
a O
good O
impression O
by O
taking O
some O
tapas. O

There O
is O
a O
list O
of O
plasticized O
and O
priceless O
suggestions, B-TARGET
included O
in O
the O
letter O
and O
as O
long O
as O
the O
letter. O

They O
also O
read O
you O
even O
more O
suggestions. B-TARGET

We O
asked O
for O
several O
of O
the O
suggestions O
in O
the O
list, O
because O
the O
normal O
menu B-TARGET
was O
very O
unoriginal.All O
cost O
between O
23 O
and O
28 O
€, O
even O
salads! B-TARGET

Very O
expensive, O
very O
expensive O
for O
quality. O

Plus O
having O
to O
run O
out O
on O
time, O
'cause O
they O
do O
dinner O
shifts. B-TARGET

At O
these O
prices O
I O
find O
it O
an O
insult! O

I'm O
not O
coming O
back. O

Thanks O
to O
both O
of O
you O
for O
giving O
me O
the O
information, O
one O
day O
I've O
gone O
to O
the O
bar O
but O
you O
didn't O
give O
me O
to O
come O
down, O
I O
won't O
do O
it O
because O
for O
what O
you O
put O
more O
than O
go O
down O
to O
the O
salon, B-TARGET
you O
go O
down O
to O
hell. O

It O
is O
not O
the O
economy O
for O
people O
to O
pay O
60 O
euracos O
in O
a O
salad B-TARGET
and O
a O

for O
lack O

Well O

Hi, O
I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
twice O

we O
liked O
it O
quite O
a O

Casually O
we O

dined O

it O
was O

we O

We O

We O

quality. O

The O
catch B-TARGET
and O
the O
cod B-TARGET
acceptable. O

Dessert B-TARGET
also O
vulgar. O

The O
most O
outstanding O
service B-TARGET
of O
a O
company O
dinner, O
therefore O
the O
service O
was O
not O
good. O

A O
lot O
of O
modernity O
but O
nothing O
special. O

We're O
not O
coming O
back. O

I O
was O
there O
the O
other O
day O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
great. O

The O
deal B-TARGET
was O
cordial O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
splendid, O
they O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
good O
details O
that O
that O
likes O
because O
not O
in O
all O
the O
itios O
they O
do. O

They O
were O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
in O
a O
monnet O
and O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O
call O
them. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
at O
its O
point O
and O
well O
presented. O

I O
go O
quite O
often O
and O
I O
love O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
always O
very O
correct O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good. O

We O
always O
ask O
for O
the O
tempura B-TARGET
that O
is O
very O
good O
(despite O
the O
previous O
comments), O
truffle B-TARGET
croquette I-TARGET
that O
is O
expectacular O
and O
ravioli B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
longaniza I-TARGET
de I-TARGET
Graus I-TARGET
that O
is O
expectacular O
as O
well. O

The O
second B-TARGET
ones O
I've O
tried O
several, O
but O
always O
good. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
didn't O
convince O
me O
was O
the O
duck B-TARGET
magret I-TARGET
that O
was O
sloppy. O

We O
always O
drink O
cava B-TARGET
and O
get O
it O
very O
cold, O
as O
it O
should O
be O
and O
in O
few O
places O
you O
get O
it O
properly. O

The O
price O
is O
good, O
nothing O
exaggerated. O

It's O
definitely O
a O
place B-TARGET
I O
recommend. O

I O
haven't O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
cooking O
this O
restaurant, O
but O
the O
deal B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
yesterday, O
with O
my O
4-month-old O
baby O
and O
my O
partner O
tried O
to O
go O
to O
the O
tapas O
contest O
that O
is O
held O
every O
year O
in O
zaragoza O
and O
told O
us O
in O
very O
bad O
ways O
that O
on O
Sunday O
he O
only O
ate O
on O
the O
letter O
and O
that O
they O
didn't O
do O
the O
contest O
(which O
in O
the O
propaganda O
is O
announced O
until O
November O
25), O
and O
also O
they O
wanted O
us O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
passing O
area, O
with O
the O
cart O
away...in O
short, O
not O
to O
return, O
and O
without O
trying O
it!!!!! O

No O
wonder O
Marta's O
comment, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
of O
this O
place O
should O
be O
dedicated O
to O
other O
needs. O

The O
lack O
of O
education B-TARGET
and O
its O
terrible O
attention B-TARGET
are O
his O
credentials. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
well, O
with O
a O
brief O
decoration B-TARGET
(”minimalist”) O
very O
nice, O
the O
right O
treatment B-TARGET
we O
ate O
very O
well O
and O
did O
not O
seem O
expensive O
for O
the O
three O
we O
went. O

In O
short, O
good-very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
correct O
and O
professional O
service B-TARGET

We O
had O
dinner O
yesterday O
Saturday, O
for O
our O
anniversary, O
two O
people. O

We O
were O
very O
pleased O
and O
had O
dinner O
very O
well, O
the O
seasonal B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
with O
some O
menu O
dish O
that O
then O
adjusted O
us O
as O
a O
menu. O

It's O
all O
very O
correct. O

I O
think O
it's O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
it's O
hard O
for O
something O
to O
go O
wrong, O
from O
these O
places, O
you're O
always O
right. O

Very O
recommendable. O

We'll O
be O
back. O

We O
were O
recently O
my O
partner O
and O
I O
eating O
and O
everything O
turned O
out O
very O
well, O
both O
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
wine, B-TARGET
the O
deal, B-TARGET
the O
decoration... B-TARGET
we O
liked O
everything O
very O
much. O

By O
the O
way, O
there O
were O
small O
children O
and O
no O
problem. O

I O
spent O
last O
week O
(between O
week) O
having O
dinner O
and O
it O
went O
very O
well.Both O
the O
attention B-TARGET
(very O
attentive O
and O
giving O
appropriate O
advice), O
such O
as O
food, B-TARGET
and O
waiting B-TARGET
time. I-TARGET

We O
didn't O
take O
a O
menu, O
we O
took O
loose O
plates. O

Both O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
wine B-TARGET
were O
advice O
of O
the O
maitre, B-TARGET
and O
the O
truth O
was O
very O
accurate. O

We O
have O
eaten O
seasonal B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
( O
26 O
€ O
) O
: O
All O
good, O
but O
you O
come O
out O
with O
the O
feeling O
of O
having O
paid O
more O
than O
you O
should O
(and O
that O
I O
haven't O
paid O
for O
). O

And O
the O
children's B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
a O
stable; O
the O
menu O
follows O
the O
logic O
of O
what O
a O
child O
can O
eat O
without O
complications O
and O
is O
all O
good, O
but O
it O
follows O
the O
tonic O
of O
the O
rest: O
expensive.There O
is O
doubt O
as O
to O
what O
it O
will O
be O
like O
to O
eat O
by O
letter, O
but O
on O
its O
own, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
options O
available, O
I O
don't O
think O
I'll O
come O
back O
to O
check O
it O
out. O

Thanks O
for O
your O
advice O
Nacho... O
and O
congratulations O
on O
your O
18th O
birthday, O
be O
happy! O

In O
Zaragoza O
there O
are O
correct O
restaurants, O
good, O
very O
good, O
restaurants O
to O
which O
you O
do O
not O
return, O
those O
that O
go O
unnoticed, O
mediocre O
and O
terrible O
like O
for O
example O
La B-TARGET
Scala. I-TARGET

To O
affirm O
that O
true O
delights B-TARGET
can O
be O
tasted O
in O
this O
place O
is O
a O
real O
recklessness. O

To O
forget. O

Very O
well O
both O
the O
service B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
the O
attention B-TARGET
received O
and O
the O
dinner B-TARGET

We O

We'll O
repeat. O

We O
ate O
great. O

We O
decided O
on O
the O
seasonal B-TARGET

and O
it O
was O
a O
hit. O

Elaborated O
and O
tasty O
food, B-TARGET
generous O
amounts B-TARGET
and O
perfect O
service. B-TARGET

I O
totally O
recommend O
it. O

All O
great, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
full O
and O
they O
still O
took O
good O
care O
of O
us. O

We O
ate O
there O
on O
Sunday, O
May O
10. O

You O
can't O
find O
better O
value O
for O
money O
in O
Zaragoza. O

A O
menu B-TARGET
of O
25 O
euros O
impeccable, O
the O
place O
has O
a O
relaxing O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
professional. O

The O
Rogout B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
manitas I-TARGET
proves O
the O
existence O
of O
God O
the O
Father. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
delicious O
all.We O
will O
repeat!!! O

Sure!!!. O

It O
must O
have O
been, O
reading O
these O
comments O
that O
we O
should O
have O
come O
to O
this O
restaurant O
on O
a O
bad O
day. O

It's O
the O
first O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza O
where O
we O
really O
didn't O
like O
it O
at O
all. O

I O
remember O
first, O
I O
ordered O
a O
tempura O
of O
vegetables O
with O
soy O
sauce. O

From O
second O
duck O
magret O
and O
dessert B-TARGET
I O
don't O
remember, O
yes, O
I O
remember O
that O
neither O
was O
nor O
fa. O

But O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
when O
I O
like O
dessert O
I O
remember O
it O
very O
well. O

The O
tempura B-TARGET
aside O
from O
not O
being O
especially O
good. O

Both O
me O
and O
other O
people O
who O
tasted O
it O
didn't O
feel O
right. O

The O
unfine O
magret B-TARGET
had O
the O
duck's O
hairs O
incredibly. O

I O
think O
that O
a O
restaurant O
that O
presents O
a O
modern O
style, B-TARGET
minimalist O
and O
quite O
snob O
can O
not O
present O
a O
dish B-TARGET
like O
this, O
but O
of O
course O
the O
salsa O
and O
presentation O
at O
first O
glance O
all O
tapas. O

Very O
expensive, O
a O
wanting O
to O
be O
and O
not O
being O
able. O

I O
don't O
recommend O
it O
at O
all. O

No O
noz O
made O
the O
20% O
discount O

We O
ate O
well. O

The O
very O
good O
risotto. B-TARGET

They O
were O
a O
little O
slow O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Perfect O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
fabulous. O

Large O
windows B-TARGET
to O
enjoy O
"Les O
Rambles". O

very O
professional O
service B-TARGET
with O
the O
kitchen O
in O
sight O
and O
where O
the O
chef B-TARGET
covers O
his O
mouth O
with O
a O
mask O
(very O
hygienic). O

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
too. O

They O
didn't O
apply O
20% O
when O
I O
got O
the O
bill, B-TARGET
but O
they O
told O
me O
and O
they O
brought O
me O
the O
fixed O
bill. O

Fantastic O
if O
you O
go O
to O
the O
theater O
Poliorama O

Good O
location, B-TARGET
good O
service, B-TARGET
unbeatable O
quality-price O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
slow O
and O
we O
had O
to O
claim O
20%. O

The O
average O
price O
went O
to O
20 O
with O
the O
discount. O

The O
only O
thing O
on O
the O
page O
they O
say O
that O
they O
have O
gluten-free O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
they O
have O
no O
information O
either O
in O
the O
letter O
or O
the O
same O
waiter... B-TARGET
they O
doubted O
everything. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
with O
some O
small O
details O
to O
improve. O

Quick B-TARGET
between O
plates. O

They O
should O
improve O
control O
in O
cooking O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
base I-TARGET
they O
use. O

Sometimes O
raw O
in O
some O
areas. O

Good O
place, B-TARGET
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
quite O
cozy. O

Good O
relationship O
quality O
price O

It's O
something O
more O
expensive O
than O
what O
appears O
on O
the O
web. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
they O
didn't O
want O
to O
make O
the O
discount O
because O
they O
said O
the O
discount O
was O
for O
full O
dinners O
it O
didn't O
go O
for O
mixed O
dishes O
without O
dessert... O

The O
discount B-TARGET
voucher I-TARGET
doesn't O
put O
any O
of O
this O
in O
it. O

Amazing O
restaurant, B-TARGET
incredible O
service, B-TARGET
magnificent O
staff B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

100% O
recommended O
we O
will O
go O
again. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice, O
plus O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

As O
always O
we O
have O
gone, O
La O
Poma B-TARGET
gets O
a O
10 O
in O
value O
for O
money. O

On O
this O
day O
25/12, O
we O
appreciated O
more O
slow O
in O
service B-TARGET
surely O
because O
there O
were O
less O
staff O
on O
such O
a O
marked O
day, O
otherwise O
excellent O
value O
for O
money. O

Everything O
very O
very O
rich O
excellent O

My O
opinion O
of O
the O
restaurant O
La B-TARGET
Poma I-TARGET
is O
that O
it O
is O
correct, O
but O
not O
extraordinary. O

We O
order O
a O
risotto B-TARGET
(acceptable) O
and O
a O
pizza B-TARGET
(very O
improved) O
and O
desserts B-TARGET
(the O
best). O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
efficient O
but O
not O
especially O
friendly. O

They O
were O
wrong O
to O
bring O
one O
of O
the O
dishes O
and O
rectified O
but O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
bit. O

In O
the O
account O
they O
forgot O
to O
make O
the O
discount O
and O
it O
was O
also O
necessary O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
rectification. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
quite O
achieved. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
full O
of O
tourists. O

Excellent O
homemade O
food B-TARGET
that O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
mother's O
food. O
they O
have O
made O
a O
great O
reform B-TARGET
to O
satisfy O
their O
customers O
̈thank O
you O

I O
recommend O
it, O
a O
place O
where O
you O
can O
enjoy O
homemade O
food B-TARGET
or O
also O
a O
good O
beef B-TARGET
chop I-TARGET
to O
the O
stone O
within O
affordable O
prices, O
for O
those O
who O
like O
good O
wines, B-TARGET
you O
have O
a O
great O
variety O
of O
them O
with O
which O
to O
accompany O
a O
good O
meal, O
as O
for O
the O
people O
who O
attend O
it, O
Ana B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
owner I-TARGET
takes O
care O
of O
making O
your O
stay O
comfortable O
and O
her O
mother B-TARGET
in O
the O
kitchen O
an O
excellent O
cook O
and O
a O
charm O
of O
woman. O

We O
have O
eaten O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
grilled I-TARGET
price O
good O
quality, O
the O
keys B-TARGET
we O
have O
tasted O
of O
10. O

We'll O
recommend O
it. O

Good O
place B-TARGET
to O
repeat O

We O
ate O
on O
Sunday O
October O
20 O
and O
we O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
great, O
we O
tried O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
nice I-TARGET
pickled I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
house I-TARGET
very O
good, O
the O
meats B-TARGET
very O
well O
elaborated, O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
almost O
left O
over, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
make O
an O
effort O
that O
was O
worth O
the O
effort O
and O
enough O
wines B-TARGET
to O
be O
able O
to O
choose. O

highly O
recommended O
and O
to O
return!!! O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
bit O
to O
sit O
down, O
but O
very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
it's O
worth O
it. O

Excellent O
the O
attention B-TARGET
of O
all O
the O
staff, O
the O
food B-TARGET
not O
to O
speak O
all O
very O
good O
about O
all O
the O
ternasco B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
grill I-TARGET
uff O
it O
still O
taste, O
very O
good O
quantity O
for O
the O
one O
that O
is O
comelon, O
a O
little O
away O
from O
the O
center, O
but O
otherwise O
the O
tasty O
makes O
forget O
the O
apart, O
really O
is O
very O
good, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
of O
good O
palate. O

We O
went O
7 O
people O
with O
a O
child O
so O
much O
the O
deal B-TARGET
with O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
I O
recommend O
it O

Dinner B-TARGET
was O
great. O

We O
were O
a O
large O
group, O
20 O
people, O
and O
we O
were O
attended O
by O
phenomenal O
and O
very O
effective. O

The O
salad, B-TARGET
the O
fried B-TARGET
starters, I-TARGET
the O
cheese, B-TARGET
phenomenal. O

Like O
2nd O
dish O
I O
chose O
churrasco, B-TARGET
which O
was O
sensational, O
and O
with O
homemade B-TARGET
fries I-TARGET
(not O
frozen). O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
also O
very O
good, O
shots O
at O
the O
end, O
coffees O
and O
everything O
for O
20 O
€ O
per O
person. O

The O
comments O
were O
favorable O
for O
everything O
except O
wine. B-TARGET

Hard O
came O
from O
hard O
land. O

There O
are O
very O
good O
young O
wines B-TARGET
from O
Cariñena O
for O
less O
than O
2 O
€ O
a O
bottle. O

The O
only O
point O
of O
improvement. O

Thank O
you! O

We O
had O
the O
grilled O
menu O
at O
this O
restaurant O
today. O

It O
won't O
be O
the O
last O
time O
we O
go, O
'cause O
we O
loved O
it. O

The O
great O
service B-TARGET
and O
dinner B-TARGET
very O
well O
as O
well. O

It's O
definitely O
recommended. O

A O
week O
ago O
we O
went O
to O
the O
Candelas O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
it O
was O
their O
grill B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
we O
tried O
and O
except O
for O
the O
wine B-TARGET
that O
I O
earn O
a O
lot O
by O
turning O
it O
into O
summer O
red, O
the O
dinner O
was O
satisfactory. O

We O
met O
your O
summer O
offer O
and O
said O
we'd O
be O
back. O

Today O
at O
lunch O
two O
diners O
have O
tasted O
said O
menu O
and O
a O
third O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day. O
we O
have O
all O
left. O

Very O
satisfied, O
the O
price O
very O
adjusted. O

Sinduda, O
we'll O
repeat. O

Highly O
recommended O
and O
excellent O
treatment B-TARGET
of O
the O
Chamber O
Chief. O

Return O
from O
vacation O
and O
it O
seems O
opportune O
to O
go O
back O
where O

ended O
up, O
if O
the O
last O
one O
was O
a O
good O
experience.Excellent O
choice O
both O
on O
your O
menu B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
grill, I-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
that O
summer B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

Today O
is O
the O
second O
time O
we O
tried O
it O
and O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
three O
rices B-TARGET
served, O
the O
black B-TARGET
one, O
the O
callus B-TARGET
one O
and O
the O
novel O
one O
of O
rebozuelo. B-TARGET

Magnificent O
Ana's B-TARGET
attention O
and O
today O
the O
icing O
was O
a O
carajillo O
of O
rum, O
as O
it O
should O
be, O
the O
work O
of O
a O
good O
waitress. B-TARGET

I O
hope O
you O
don't O
forget O
with O
the O
end O
of O
summer, O
a O
very O
tight O
and O
tasty O
menu. B-TARGET

In O
any O
case O
it O
was O
a O
good O
return O
to O
the O
routine O
and O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
course. O

Excellent O
work B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
kitchen, I-TARGET
at O
a O
very O
interesting O
price. O

Exquisite O
treatment, O
tasty O
food, B-TARGET
in O
an O
atmosphere B-TARGET
without O
luxuries O
but O
with O
a O
quality O
price O
ratio O
almost O
impossible O
to O
find O
in O
Zaragoza. O

It O
gives O
a O
luxury O
as O
room O
manager, O
Eduardo B-TARGET
Orus I-TARGET
a O
special O
touch O
on O
the O

Ingenious O
tasting B-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
that O
are O
changing O
successfully. O

Definitely O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
consider O
every O
week. O

The O
attention B-TARGET
has O
been O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
acceptable, O
but O
my O
complaint O
is O
with O
the O
reservation, B-TARGET
on O
the O
internet, O
otherwise O
I O
would O
have O
personally O
introduced O
myself O
would O
have O
had O
a O
shock. O

It O
was O
all O
busy!!!. O

They O
made O
room O
for O
me O
at O
some O
high O
tables O
in O
the O
cafeteria. O

The O
food, B-TARGET
very O
good. O

The O
nice O
deal, B-TARGET
and O
the O
quick O
service. O

The O
price O
for O
times O
of O
crisis O
that O
we O
go O
through O
a O
little O
above O
our O
budgets. O

However O
good O
price O
quality O
ratio. O

I'm O
sure O
we'll O
be O
back. O

I O
liked O
it. O

I O
didn't O
know O
him, O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

For O
putting O
a O
stick O
in O
it, O
the O
excessive O
noise, B-TARGET
there O
were O
many O
people O
and O
in O
the O
room O
it O
resonates O
a O
lot O
and O
we O
could O
hardly O
hear O
each O
other. O

Hello, O
we O
went O
yesterday O
day O
12-08-2011, O
and O
really O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
exquisite. O

I O
loved O
it. O

Sincerely, O
very O
nice, O
especially O
the O
sirloin B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
fine O
red O
wine, O
the O
best O
I O
have O
tried O
and O
very O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

It's O
very O
comfortable, O
my O
favorite O
barcelona O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Never O
let O
him O
down. O

The O
prices O
a O
little O
high, O
but O
it O
compensates O
with O
the O
good O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
and O
the O
professionalism O
of O
all O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

correct O
and O
maximum O
comfort. O

It O
has O
given O
me O
a O
free O
impression, O
both O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
your O
products B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
exquisite O
treatment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
your I-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

I O
will O
repeat O
when O
I O
return O
to O
Barcelona O
and O
have O
already O
recommended O
my O
friends. O

Very O
correct O
quality O
and O
service. B-TARGET

A O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
within O
Barcelona's O
mid/high O
range O

A O
very O
quiet O
and O
perfect O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
special O
occasions O
with O
family, O
etc... O

A O
wide O
and O
varied O
card. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
attentive O
and O
fast, O
without O
ever O
being O
overwhelming. O

To O
recommend. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
price, O
plus O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
together O
and O
you O
hear O
without O
wanting O
all O
the O
conversations O
around. O

I'm O
definitely O
not O
coming O
back, O
at O
least O
paying O
for O
myself. O

It O
can O
be O
summed O
up O
in O
a O
word: O
Excellent O

Very O
good O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
well O
cooked. O

Quick O
service, B-TARGET
very O
friendly. O

I O
don't O
give O
you O
a O
10 O
because O
it's O
a O
little O
expensive O
but O
it's O
worth O
going. O

It O
must O
always O
be O
a O
reference O
place. B-TARGET

We O
went O
for O
a O
recommedation O
and O
it O
was O
quite O
a O
success. O

The O
xatonate B-TARGET
and O
the O
croquettes B-TARGET
a O
delight. O

As O
a O
second, O
I O
recommend O
shrimps B-TARGET
especially O
if O
they O
invite O
you. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

I'll O
give O
you O
a O
8.5. O

We O
always O
go O
when O
we O
don't O
know O
where O
to O
go O
for O
dinner, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
fine O
and O
the O
price O
in O
comparison O
is O
worth O
it. O

Service B-TARGET
and O
treatment O
are O
certainly O
one O
of O
the O
best O
of O
BCN, O
and O
that O
I O
have O
tasted O
many O
restaurants. O

Something O
they O
can O
do O
better? O

Cut B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
into O
thinner O
slices! O

Impeccable, O
extraordinary O
quality O
in O
terms O
of O
product, B-TARGET
presentation O
and O
"point". O

The O
service B-TARGET
lustrous, O
impeccable, O
elegant. O

No O
hits. O

As O
always, O
L'Olivé O
is O
a O
sure O
value. O

Catalan O
and O
market O
cuisine, O
based O
on O
optimal O
product B-TARGET
quality. O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
enjoys O
an O
enviable O
homogeneity. O

He's O
never O
gonna O
let O
them O
down. O

It O
is O
always O
of O
insurmountable O
excellence. O

The O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
excellent O
value O
for O
money. O

Very O
expensive O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
they O
offer, O
I O
have O
eaten O
the O
same O
or O
better O
in O
La O
Flauta, O
El O
Asador O
de O
Aranda, O
etc. O

for O
a O
lot O
less. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
I'm O
not O
going O
back O
to. O

Nothing O
to O
object O
to O
food, B-TARGET
or O
decoration, B-TARGET
but O
I O
want O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
what O
the O
restaurant O
would O
deserve. O

The O
best O
in O
Barcelona. O

All O
excellent. O

The O
price O
is O
high, O
but O
it's O
worth O
it. O

The O
place B-TARGET
very O
well, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
but O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes, O
since O
it O
is O
charged, O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

Another O
detail O
of O
bad O
taste O
is O
that O
the O
entertainments B-TARGET
they O
put O
at O
first O
charge O
you. O

As O
always O
L'Olivé O
offers O
an O
impeccable O
quality O
Catalan O
and O
market O
cuisine. B-TARGET

The O
product B-TARGET
is O
always O
first O
class O
and O
of O
an O
enviable O
homogeneity. O

Its O
selection O
of O
"to O
bite" O
is O
remarkable: O
excellent O
squid B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Roman I-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
fresh O
and O
overflowing O
boquerons. B-TARGET

Flawless O
fish B-TARGET
and O
a O
cooking, O
whether O
grilled O
or O
baked, O
always O
at O
its O
point. O

Some O
desserts B-TARGET
for O
greedy O
people, O
highlighting O
one O
of O
the O
best O
" O
Catalan B-TARGET
creams I-TARGET
" O
and O
an O
" O
tiramisu B-TARGET
" O
of O
anthology. O

The O
winery B-TARGET
is O
sufficient O
and O
with O
a O
very O
well O
chosen O
variety O
and O
at O
suitable O
prices. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
pleasant O
and O
not O
noisy. O

It O
is O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
repeat, O
repeat O
and O
repeat. O

Excellent! O

Very O
rich O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
or O
very O
good O
would O
say, O
the O
price O
is O
carillo O
but O
normal O
in O
this O
area O
of O
Barcelona, O
now O
the O
service O
is O
very O
improveable O
above O
all O
that O
you O
do O
not O
touch O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
of O
the O
haste O
that O
wants O
you O
to O
leave O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
and O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
noise. O

Passable. O

Good. O

Good O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
although O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
speeding O
up O
as O
if O
they O
were O
turning O
off O
a O
fire O
cone. O

They're O
actually O
trying O
to O
get O
you O
to O
leave O
the O
table O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
to O
take O
a O
second O
shift. O

It's O
not O
a O
bargain O
in O
terms O
of O
price. O

We O
loved O
it, O
we O
took O
clients O
for O
work, O
and O
we O
had O
dinner O
on O
weekends O
alone... O
until O
recently O
we O
came O
back O
with O
some O
friends O
and... O
what O
a O
disappointment!!! O

Poor O
deal, O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
make O
no O
sense O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
has O
a O
lot O
of O
noise! O

The O
service B-TARGET
stops O
wanting O
and O
sincerely O
told O
you O
that O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
spent O
its O
best O
time. O

The O
truth O
is, O
it's O
too O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get. O

I O
had O
very O
high O
expectations O
after O
having O
been O
in O
the O
Barcelonta O
of O
the O
same O
group, O
but O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed: O
overheated O
food, B-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
noise, B-TARGET
very O
close O
tables, B-TARGET
cold O
and O
unpleasant O
treatment... B-TARGET

I'm O
not O
coming O
back. O

My O
favorite O
for O
special O
celebrations O
for O
many O
years. O

I've O
trusted O
him O
since O
he O
was O
at O
the O
C/Muntaner. O

It O
never O
fails O
me! O

Acceptable O
food O
at O
a O
somewhat O
high O
price O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
lacks O
a O
renovation, O
has O
remained O
somewhat O
old-fashioned O
in O
every O
way. O

the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
nice; O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
a O
little O
expensive; O
the O
service B-TARGET
treated O
us O
fatal O
(February O
2007); O
noisy, O
impertinent, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
enjoy O
dinner. O

Undoubtedly, O
the O
worst O
thing O
about O
the O
restaurant O
is O
the O
decoration, B-TARGET
strangely O
praised O
by O
some. O

Minimalist? O

Impersonal, O
the O
worst O
thing O
that O
can O
happen O
to O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
wants O
to O
have O
a O
voice O
of O
its O
own. O

Moreover, O
the O
good O
service B-TARGET
within O
that, O
as O
a O
pepero O
politician O
(Cañete) O
said, O
the O
"new" O
waiters O
do O
not O
differentiate O
a O
rice O
from O
a O
noodle... O
but O
at O
least O
they O
are O
effective O
and O
attentive. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
good O
in O
terms O
of O
quality O
and O
quantity. O

Do O
not O
expect O
extraordinary O
dishes, B-TARGET
but O
they O
are O
mostly O
very O
good O
(which O
is O
not O
little). O

It O
should O
greatly O
improve O
your O
wine B-TARGET
list. I-TARGET

Total; O
good O
food, B-TARGET
with O
little O
capacity O
for O
surprise O
and O
quite O
expensive. O

They O
have O
repeated O
it O
in O
several O
opinions: O
the O
noise B-TARGET
is O
insufferable!! O

I O
loved O
the O
foie B-TARGET
vedella I-TARGET
steak, O
generally O
giving O
it O
a O
score O
of O
9. O

The O
letter B-TARGET
that O
comes O
out O
online O
would O
have O
to O
be O
more O
extensive. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
were O
there O
yesterday O
to O
celebrate O
his O
birthday. O

And O
the O
truth O
is, O
we O
had O
a O
great O
time. O

The O
food B-TARGET
very O
but O
very O
good, O
I O
still O
remember O
foie B-TARGET
and O
duck B-TARGET
mangret I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
strawberry I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

I O
loved O
it. O

It's O
true O
that O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
in O
a O
hurry, O
but O
we O
did O
well, O
because O
after O
dinner O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
theater, O
and O
we O
still O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

Don't O
take O
care O
of O
the O
client, O
sorollos, O
a O
scandal, O
ha O

and O

Outstanding. O

I O
don't O
understand O
how O
many O
comments O
catalogue O
it O
as O
expensive... O

We O
are O
talking O
about O
a O
very O
fine O
place B-TARGET
located O
in O
the O
Barcelona O
cogollo, O
therefore, O
I O
understand, O
that O
has O
to O
be O
reflected O
in O
the O
price. O

Excellent O
quality, O
extensive O
menu, B-TARGET
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
very O
caring O
facilities B-TARGET
and O
private O
lounges O
that O
extol O
everything O
said. O

In O
short, O
don't O
miss O
it. O

Fair O
enough. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad O
but O
for O
what O
they O
give O
is O
expensive. O

The O
place O
is O
not O
bad O
but O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
noisy. O

Ideal O
for O
Guiris O
or O
business O
but O
I O
would O
never O
go O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
or O
my O
friends. O

I O
am O
regular O
at O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
when O
there O
are O
company O
or O
family O
celebrations. O

The O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
excellent O
considering O
what's O
out O
there. O

Highly O
recommended. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
for O
my O
taste O
the O
price O
is O
exceeded O
in O
relation O
to O
quality O
price. O

I O
had O
been O
recommended O
to O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
the O
truth O
is, O
it O
was O
worth O
a O
try. O

Very O
good O
treatment B-TARGET
by O
all O
the O
staff O
(right, O
polite O
and O
professional), O
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
a O
relaxed O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
dining O
room. O

I O
just O
loved O
it! O

I O
recommend O
it!!!! O

I O
recommend O
it, O
it O
eats O
very O
good O
quality, O
excellent O
price O
which O
is O
what O
is O
important, O
good O

Impeccable. O

Kitchen, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
extraordinary O
staff, B-TARGET
and O
very O
professional. O

I O
feel O
fooled! O

I O
made O
my O
reservation O
by O
phone, O
if O
at O
22:00 O
and O
they O
tell O
me O
the O
show O
starts O
at O
23:30. O

Perfectly O
clear O
on O
a O
sign O
at O
the O
entrance O
at O
23:30 O
on O
Saturday O
“Las O
Posesas”. O

We O
had O
dinner O
my O
lady O
and O
I O
correctly O
the O
service B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
also O
without O
being O
anything O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary, O
the O
sorbets B-TARGET
were O
mediocre O
not O
to O
say O
that O
they O
were O
not O
up O
to O
the O
paid, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
bad O
up O
to O
here O
everything O
correct, O
about O
the O
12th O
and O
fourth O
appear O
“The O
Posesses” O
They O
start O
taking O
pictures O
with O
some O
client O
and O
to O
go O
around O
the O
place. O

At O
one O
time O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
already O
asleep O
waiting O
for O
the O
promised O
show O
and O
we O
left, O
before O
leaving O
I O
told O
a O
bar B-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
and O
no O
longer O
answered O
me O
as O
at O
the O
beginning O
with O
good O
words O
and O
education O
now O
he O
tells O
me O
that O
it O
is O
not O
his O
problem O
and O
that O
it O
was O
not O
his O
fault O
that O
the O
show O
indicated O
at O
23:30 O
was O
one O
and O
had O
not O
started. O

Poseso O
I O
feel O
deceived O
to O
book O
a O
dinner O
with O
show O
and O
I O
left O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
later O
without O
seeing O
the O
show, O
I O
paid O
66€ O
for O
the O
dinner O
of O
two O
I O
could O
have O
gone O
to O
any O
other O
restaurant O
that O
for O
that O
amount O
I O
had O
eaten O
equal O
or O
better O
and O
I O
was O
deceived O
I O
did O
not O
enjoy O
any O
performance. O

You O
value O

We O
were O
at O
dinner, O
and O
we O
had O
a O
really O
good O
time. O

They O
performed O
the B-TARGET
Posesses I-TARGET
and O
they O
did O
a O
very O
entertaining O
and O
fun O
show B-TARGET
both O
on O
stage O
and O
when O
they O
are O
with O
people O
taking O
pictures O
they O
are O
very O
nice. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
were O
well O
served O
and O
it O
is O
appreciated O
that O
the O
performance B-TARGET
begins O
when O
we O
have O
finished O
dinner. O

Then O
we've O
gone O
more O
times. O

I O
was O
with O
a O
friend O
last O
Friday, O
I O
had O
recommended O
it O
because O
I O
had O
already O
been O
there O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
a O
different O
place, B-TARGET
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
have O
dinner, O
have O
a O
fun O
time, O
have O
a O
drink O
and O
have O
dinner O
something, O
well, O
total O
disappointment, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
before O
more O
innovative, O
has O
now O
become O
another O
restaurant. O

We O
had O
à O
la O
carte O
dinner, O
the O
delicious O
stick B-TARGET
tartar, I-TARGET
the O
meat B-TARGET
; O
for O
the O
hard O
price, O
the O
very O
good O
attention, B-TARGET
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
a O
very O
good O
tasting, O
in O
short O
it O
seemed O
very O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
had, O
we O
went O
out O
at O
60 O
€ O
per O
head. O

Quite O
an O
excess O
of O
the O
truth. O

I'm O
not O
coming O
back. O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

They O
serve O
delicious O
dishes, B-TARGET
whether O
new O
or O
traditional. O

The O
maître O
recommended O
two O
wines, B-TARGET
a O
red O
and O
a O
white, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
success. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
service, B-TARGET
fast O
and O
attentive. O

In O
serving O
the O
dishes, O
the O
manager B-TARGET
of O
the O
premises O
gives O
succinct O
and O
pertinent O
explanations O
that O
are O
appreciated. O

With O
so O
many O
virtues O
I O
expected O
a O
reed O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
family O
dinner O
we O
celebrated O
there. O

But O
it O
wasn't O
like O
that. O

In O
total, O
190 O
euros O
for O
six O
people. O

A O
reasonable O
price, O
in O
my O
opinion. O

Highly O
recommended. O

We'll O
be O
back. O

<-> O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
or O
a O
coffee O
of O
Mediterranean O
cuisine, O
it O
is O
a O
"place" O
where O
they O
have O
a O
mini O
menu O
of O
tapas, B-TARGET
served O
in O
a O
trays O
in O
which O
you O
can O
hardly O
use O
as O
a O
dish, O
with O
an O
average O
quality O
of O
them, O
and O
that O
to O
survive O
offer O
a O
menu O
of O
nine O
euros, O
A O
GOOD O
ENENDEDOR O
POCAS O
PALABRAS O
BASTAN. O

Nothin'. O

the O
very O
correct O
service, B-TARGET
the O
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
exceeding O
the O
tiramisu, B-TARGET
which O
for O
my O
taste, O
was O
bitter. O

The O
kindness O
with O
which O
we O
were O
treated O
was O
exquisite. O

The O
elaboration O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
the O
menu O
that O
offer O
of O
20€, O
exceptional. O

They O
try O
hard O
to O
get O
it O
right. O

<->The O
menu B-TARGET
reserved O
Internet O
pot, O
was O
not, O
air O
did O
not O
workbs, O
much O
heat, O
the O
treatment O
of O
the O
wrong O
manager B-TARGET
and O
the O
food, B-TARGET
not O
good, O
nor O
in O
quantity. O

The O
Catalan O
waitress O
who O
attended O
us. O

The O
restaurant, O
phenomenal, O
both O
food B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

The O
pity O
is O
that O
the O
offer O
of O
40% O
on O
the O
letter, O
was O
not O
such. O

The O
discount O
does O
not O
apply O
to O
tapas O
(also O
on O
the O
menu), O
desserts O
(also O
on O
the O
menu) O
or O
drinks O
(this O
is O
normal). O

So O
the O
discount O
is O
basically O
on O
second O
plates O
and O
salads O
(low O
on O
the O
menu). O

For O
6 O
people, O
we O
ordered O
3 O
tapas, O
1 O
salad, O
6 O
seconds O
and O
3 O
desserts O
more O
drinks. O

It O
was O
€28 O
per O
person O
(including O
the O
discount O
in O
seconds). O

If O
no O
discount O
is O
applied O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
expensive. O

And O
although O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
much O
worth O
(as O
well O
as O
the O
service), B-TARGET
the O
environment, B-TARGET
local B-TARGET
and O
terrace, B-TARGET
could O
be O
better. O

Very O
reasonable O
quality O
and O
price, O
having O
30% O
on O
the O
menu O
(only O
meals). O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
very O
attentive O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
good O
and O
enough. O

Nor O
did O
we O
ask O
for O
anything O
special, O
a O
rice, B-TARGET
which O
was O
at O
its O
point O
and O
it O
was O
noticeable O
that O
the O
fish B-TARGET
was O
of O
quality. O

The O
sangria B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cava I-TARGET
very O
good. O

It's O
recommended O
on O
site. O

Good O
quality O
and O
correct O
quantity. O

The O

is O
pleasant O
and O
quick O
and O

Nice. O

Very O

Gonzalo, O
the O

the O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
unique, O
the O

very O
attentive O
and O
the O

a O
10. O

They O
offered O
us O
fresh O
eggs B-TARGET
from O
their O
chickens O
and O
they O
were O
exquisite. O

I'm O
sure O
we'll O
be O
back O
for O
lunch O
at O
the O
terrazza, O
or O
for O
breakfast O
at O
the O
end. O

I O
advise O
you. O

Only O
one O
criticism O
(constructive) O

In O
the O
section O
of O
environment B-TARGET
everything O
very O
correct, O
decoration, O
music, O
atmosphere, O
etc. O

Except O
the O
air O
freshener B-TARGET
used O
on O
the O
premises O

Too O
strong, O
almost O
offensive. O

Devert O
the O
good O
food B-TARGET
served O
with O
care... O
to O
improve O
this O
point. O

I O
went O
with O
some O
clients. O
We O
were O
eight O
and O
we O
loved O
it. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
exquisite O
especially O
the O
broken B-TARGET
eggs I-TARGET
that O
by O
the O
way O
explained O
to O
me O
that O
they O
are O
from O
your O
farm/mass. O

impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

They O
also O
have O
private O
lounges O
for O
group O
meals. O

I'll O
keep O
that O
in O
mind O
for O
the O
next O
few O
times. O

I O
recommend O
it!!! O

A O
quiet O
place B-TARGET
with O
few O
tables. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
of O
high O
quality O
but O
it O
is O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
price. O

Especially O
interesting O
with O
the O
30% O
discount. O

Very O
quiet O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
very O
clean, O
the O
dishes O
lacked O
a O
little O
more O
food, B-TARGET
for O
the O
high O
prices O
it O
has, O
but O
ultimately O
everything O
very O
correct, O
curious O
decoration B-TARGET

We O
arrived O
at O
22.30 O
hours O
when O
we O
had O
the O
reservation, O
and O
the O
only O
person O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
a O
Pakistani O
who O
barely O
spoke O
Spanish, O
told O
us O
that O
our O
reservation O
was O
at O
21.30. O

When O
we O
insisted O
that O
it O
was O
safe O
at O
22.30, O
I O
dissimulate O
looking O
at O
the O
papers O
of O
the O
reserve, O
and O
we O
saw O
how O
they O
had O
printed O
our O
reserve O
sheet. O

My O
husband O
began O
to O
read O
our O
data, O
where O
indeed O
the O
clear O
hour O
appeared. O

He O
quickly O
changed O
the O
sheet, O
and O
he O
wanted O
us O
to O
believe O
that O
they O
had O
confused O
us O
with O
another O
table O
that O
they O
had O
at O
8.30 O
p.m. O

You O
lie O
everything, O
you O
should O
want O
to O
close O
and O
you O
didn't O
want O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
table O
of O
two O
who O
came O
on O
top O
with O
a O
30% O
dto O
and O
lied O
to O
us O
brazenly. O

So O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
dinner O
somewhere O
else, O
and O
then O
we O
called O
ourselves O
the O
same O
man O
saying O
that O
if O
we O
came O
back O
he O
would O
invite O
us, O
we O
deduce O
that O
to O
prevent O
us O
from O
making O
bad O
publicity. O

Obviously O
we O
won't O
come O
back O
or O
believe O
any O
of O
that O
invitation. O

Shame O
on O
everything. O

We O
were O
advised O
on O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
successful. O

The O
online O
booking O
discount O
was O
respected. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
cozy O
place B-TARGET

A O
pleasure O
that O
you O
can O
eat O
at O
16:00 O
so O
calmly O
and O
so O
tasteful. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
we O
chose O
seemed O
very O
suitable. O

Good O
cooking B-TARGET
and O
good O
deal, B-TARGET
we O
will O
repeat!!!! O

Quality O
price O
well O
friendly O

Small O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
very O
cozy, O
very O
quiet, O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
and O
presentation B-TARGET
according O
to O
what O
is O
expected. O

I O
recommend O
seafood B-TARGET
paella I-TARGET
and O
cava B-TARGET
sangria. I-TARGET

We'll O
definitely O
be O
back. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
; O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
great O
set, O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
find O
in O
addition; O
in O
the O
reservation O
we O
ask O
for O
the O
table O
furthest O
away, O
so O
to O
go O
with O
a O
child, O
and O
they O
gave O
it O
to O
us O
without O
problem O
(and O
the O
place O
is O
small). O

The O
sanvalentin B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
great, O
great, O
varied, O
and O
with O
high O
quality O
food, B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
attended O
us O
great, O
cheerful, O
kind, O
friendly O
and O
attentive. O

For O
what O
was O
the O
menu, O
I O
can't O
complain O
about O
the O
price. O

Totally O
recommended!! O

Well O
decorated O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
with O
reduced O
spaces. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
attentive. O

Food's B-TARGET
good, O
but O
no O
rockets. O

The O
rations B-TARGET
were O
rather O
scarce. O

Some O
of O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
weren't O
up O
to O
the O
money O
paid. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great. O

We O
went O
on O
a O
very O
quiet O
night, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
tables, O
I O
imagine O
that O
influenced O
the O
service O
but O
I O
still O
recommend O
it. O

Very O
original O
venue, B-TARGET
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
service. B-TARGET

The O
truth O
is O
that O
this O
restaurant O
has O
surprised O
us O
by O
the O
quality-price O
ratio, O
it O
is O
not O
cheap, O
but O
everything O
is O
good O
and O
in O
sufficient O
quantities, O
we O
have O
loved O
both O
my O
husband O
and O
me. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
are O
fine O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
slow. O

We O
go O
in O
at O
22 O
and O
we O
go O
out O
at O
12.45 O
and O
we O
don't O
have O
desserts O
or O
drinks. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great. O

The O
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

the O
lighting B-TARGET
a O
little O
scarce, O
but O
cozy. O

A O
little O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is, O
but O
well, O
being O
on O
the O
breast O
you O
already O
know... O

I'll O
be O
right O
back. O

Nice, O
comfortable O
and O
modern O
place, B-TARGET
with O
a O
well-kept O
and O
good O
quality O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Regular. O

Good O
decoration, B-TARGET
normal O
food, B-TARGET
lots O
of O
noise B-TARGET
and O
something O
expensive. O

2 O
incomings O
and O
2 O
seconds, O
with O
wine O
20 O
€, O
no O
dessert O
or O
water, O
110 O
€. O

Okay, O
but O
I O
think O
they O
work O
for O
on-time O
clients, O
and O
I O
won't O
repeat O

By O
the O
way, O
paying O
almost O
€5 O
x O
the O
cutlery O
always O
bothers O
me. O

I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
restaurant; B-TARGET
we O
have O
been O
treated O
in O
a O
casual O
but O
professional O
way; O
food, B-TARGET
all O
dishes O
excellent O
quality O
and O
tasty; O
I O
will O
come O
back O
soon! O

A O
good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
exquisite O
and O
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
professionals, O
quality O
dishes, B-TARGET
well O
cooked O
and O
correct O

You O
don't O
mind O
paying O
for O
being O
well O
served O
and O
eating O
well. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

We O
all O
liked O
the O
food. B-TARGET

More O
expensive O

than O
we O
expected. O

Very O
pleasant O

lively O

Recommended. O

It O
has O
been O
our O
prinera O
visit O

surely O

on O
our O
next O

Nice O

Interesting O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
Born, O
great O
quality O
in O
the O
product B-TARGET
used, O
perhaps O
the O
only O
one O
but O
it O
would O
be O
that O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
a O
little O
close O
to O
each O

They O
haven't O
changed O
anything, O
well O
if O
for O
better O
with O
the O
new O
Asian-style O
dishes, O
after O
a O
long O
time O
without O
coming O
back, O
for O
business O
reasons, O
I O
still O
think O
it's O
the O
best O
of O

let's O
go O
that O
we O
were O
4 O
hours O
very O
well O
used, O
I O
recommend O
it O
and O
hope O
to O
return O
soon. O

I'd O
recommend O
it! O

Careful O
and O
efficient O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
meal B-TARGET
and O
with O
very O
good O
price O
quality O
ration. O

He O
met O
our O
expectations. O

Perhaps O
you O
could O
improve O
the O
distribution B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tables, I-TARGET
as O
some O
of O
them O
are O
too O
close O
together, O
and O
others O
are O
very O
close O
to O
the O
bar, O
and O
therefore, O
people O
are O
passing O
by O
the O
diners O
continuously. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
exceptional O
decoration B-TARGET
so O
we O
are O
the O
service B-TARGET
that O
was O
very O
friendly O
at O
all O
times. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
price-quality O
ratio O
seems O
bad O
to O
me, O
as O
the O
food B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
price. O

Nice O
place, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
mid-high O
note O
and O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

Recommended. O

Careful O
and O
efficient O
service, B-TARGET
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Friend O
atmosphere, O
not O
recommended O
for O
business. O

Prices: O
correct, O
normal O
in O
these O
times. O

Tasting B-TARGET
dish: I-TARGET
a O
bit O
abundant O
of O
over, O
but O
well O
cooked. O

Unique O
critical O
comments: O
scarce O
light B-TARGET
for O
a O
restaurant; O
here O
the O
decoration O
takes O
precedence O
over O
the O
function. O

Nor O
is O
it O
advisable O
to O
mix O
too O
much O
with O
customers O
who O
drink O
drinks O
with O
diners. O

For O
the O
rest, O
highly O
recommended. O

Optimal O
value O
for O
money O
in O
the O
lunch B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
in O
a O
chic O
place B-TARGET
very O
well O
set. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
description O
that O
bcnrestaurantes O
made O
of O
the O
Kafka O
was O
very O
accurate. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Absolutely O
recommended. O

Highly O
recommended, O
by O
environment B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

Warm O
and O
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
correct O
cooking. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

We O
were O
having O
three O
people O
dinner O
and O
we O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

Good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

And O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
decorated O
and O
very O
cozy. O

A O
place B-TARGET
that O
makes O
you O
feel O
at O
home. O

Excellent O
food, O
unbeatable O
product B-TARGET
and O
a O
correct O
service. B-TARGET

If O
I O
have O
to O
find O
any O
glue O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
together. O

Nice O
for O
drinks, B-TARGET
cocktails B-TARGET
and O
a O
little O
wine. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it, O
don't O
leave O
them O
indifferent. O

To O
start O
the O
dish B-TARGET
and O
the O
napkin B-TARGET
had O
black O
charcoal. O

We O
ordered O
some O
croquettes O
and O
a O
first O
class O
changet, O
we O
were O
2 O
people. O

Changet B-TARGET
was O
brine. O

As O
a O
second O
we O
ordered O
a O
black O
rice O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
allioli O
sauce O
to O
accompany. O

The O
croquettes O
literally O
threw O
them O
at O
us O
on O
the O
table O
without O
saying O
either O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
because O
through O
the O
door O
was O
a O
friend O
of O
his O
who O
sat O
down O
to O
converse O
with. O

When O
the O
rice O
came, O
I O
reminded O
him O
of O
the O
sauce O
and O
he O
didn't O
dare O
answer O
me. O

I O
began O
to O
eat, O
so O
that O
the O
ration B-TARGET
would O
not O
cool O
rather O
scarce O
and O
oh O
surprise O
was O
also O
a O
brine O
watered O
in O
ink. O

For O
the O
third O
time O
I O
ask O
her O
for O
the O
salsa O
and O
then O
she O
is O
worthy O
to O
answer O
me O
that O
they O
do O
not O
have O
and O
they O
have O
to O
do O
it O
at O
the O
moment, O
to O
which O
I O
answer O
that O
she O
could O
have O
explained O
it O
to O
me O
from O
the O
beginning O
and O
I O
would O
have O
decided O
whether O
to O
choose O
the O
dish O
or O
not O
because O
once O
eaten O
it O
no O
longer O
made O
sense O
to O
bring O
it. O

At O
that O
time O
he O
realized O
his O
negligent O
behavior O
and O
tried O
an O
apology O
for O
his O
total O
lack O
of O
professionalism O
and O
attention. O

Finally, O
since O
some O
restaurants O
do O
not O
charge O
for O
table O
service O
and O
others O
if, O
they O
could O
explain O
it O
in O
the O
letter, O
so O
we O
could O
decide O
whether O
or O
not O
to O
leave. O

Amazing, O
it's O
like O
being O
in O
new O
york O
and O
paris O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
spectacular O
decoration, B-TARGET
amazing O
staff B-TARGET
and O
its O
fresh O
market O
food B-TARGET
fascino O
me, O
I O
recommend O
you O
guys, O
luck. O

It O
was O
all O
delicious O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
very O
nice. O

Hello O
Jose O
we O
have O
been O
varying O
times O
in O
Pelentos O
de O
Sandiniés, O
and O
I O
think O
like O
you, O
which O
is O
a O
highly O
recommended O
dining B-TARGET
room. I-TARGET

I O
think O
in O
the O
magnificent O
photo O
report O
you've O
made O
there's O
a O
mistake O
where O
you O
say O
"Ajoarriero" O
isn't O
like O
that, O
the O
photo O
is O
stuffed O
peppers. O

And O
the O
special O
menu O
is O
not O
at O
30 O
but O
at O
27 O
euros. O

As O
for O
the O
children O
and O
the O
stairs, O
I O
think O
it's O
our O
problem O
that O
we'll O
grow O
up, O
it's O
been O
my O
turn O
to O
be O
quite O
pretos O
and O
to O
be O
very O
comfortable, O
anyway O
we're O
going O
to O
eat O
and O
that O
makes O
me O
relax, O
like O
and O
I O
appreciate O
what O
they O
give O
me O
without O
asking O
what O
education, O
love O
and O
a O
smile. O

And O
now O
Jose O
asks O
you O
what O
right O
do O
we O
have O
to O
talk O
about O
anyone O
on O
the O
net O
without O
asking O
them O
permission? O

even O
if O
it's O
to O
speak O
well. O

In O
case O
you O
want O
to O
update O
your O
information O
now O
they O
have O
a O
Spring B-TARGET
Menu I-TARGET
for O
19 O
euros O
and O
children's B-TARGET
menu O
for O
15 O
euros O
that O
is O
great, O
I O
recommend O
you O
go O
back, O
as O
I O
do O
and O
so O
maybe O
it O
is O
judged O
with O
more O
equity O
(we O
already O
have O
table O
reserved O
for O
April O
28, O
we O
celebrate O
my O
birthday) O

A O
greeting O
from O
Joaquina O

Hello O
Joaquina, O
thanks O
for O
your O
clarifications O
of O
the O
photos, O
with O
respect O
to O
prices O
also O
thanks O
for O
giving O
the O
new O
prices, O
in O
the O
items O
I O
indicate O
the O
price O
that O
there O
was O
at O
the O
time.Just O
clarify O
that O
in O
the O
criticism O
I O
am O
not O
talking O
about O
anyone, O
I O
am O
only O
telling O
my O
experience O
by O
using O
the O
services O
of O
a O
company, O
in O
this O
case O
a O
restaurant, O
which O
I O
paid O
rigorously. O

Can't O
we O
even O
think O
about O
what O
we O
bought? O

I O
want O
to O
think O
so. O

Another O
thing O
would O
be O
censorship O
and O
coercion. O

We O
were O
recommended O
for O
dinner O
on O
Christmas O
Eve O
and O
we O
took O
a O
great O
disappointment: O
not O
only O
did O
the O
raw B-TARGET
materials I-TARGET
leave O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
(wrapped O
with O
prawns O
and O
pre-frozen O
bag O
mushrooms) O
but O
the O
quantities B-TARGET
were O
ridiculous O
for O
the O
price. O

The O
baked B-TARGET
cod I-TARGET
(speciality O
of O
the O
house) O
was O
corked O
and O
hard, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
deer B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
(26euros O
a O
plate) O
presented O
scarcely O
and O
hardly O
without O
garnish.In O
short, O
it O
is O
presumed O
a O
quality O
supported O
by O
several O
awards O
and O
we O
have O
found O
a O
rather O
mediocre O
meal. B-TARGET

Hello, O
I O
want O
to O
leave O
my O
opinion O
on O
this O
restaurant O
on O
the O
only O
visit O
I O
have O
ever O
made, O
I O
fully O
agree O
with O
Mr. O
Aranda O
that O
the O
amount O
is O
quite O
scarce O
on O
some O
dishes B-TARGET
in O
relation O
to O
its O
price. O

I O
must O
also O
point O
out O
that O
the O
starters B-TARGET
were O
mostly O
cold O
and O
some O
peppers B-TARGET
could O
not O
be O
eaten O
because O
they O
had O
simply O
been O
taken O
from O
the O
fridge O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
quality O
is O
high, O
but O
those O
errors O
could O
be O
corrected O
so O
that O
satisfaction O
would O
be O
greater O
as O
well O
as O
giving O
a O
greater O
quantity O
of O
product. O

Last O
night O
we O
had O
dinner O
at O
Casa O
Pelentós O
de O
Sandiniés, O
where O
we O
already O
did O
it O
on O
another O
occasion O
with O
greater O
fortune, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
we O
wanted O
to O
repeat. O

It O
was O
certainly O
disappointing, O
due, O
in O
particular, O
to O
the O
shortage O
in O
the O
second B-TARGET
plates I-TARGET
in O
relation O
to O
prices. O

The O
bill B-TARGET
is O
high, O
which O
we O
already O
expected, O
although O
not O
so O
much. O

But O
we O
soon O
knew O
why: O
the O
six O
slices O
of O
bread O
were O
fattened O
to O
2.40 O
euros; O
and O
I, O
who O
could O
not O
drink O
wine O
because O
I O
had O
to O
go O
home O
through O
many O
curves, O
received O
a O
glass O
jar O
with O
tap O
water. O

It O
didn't O
matter O
much O
that O
it O
was O
outside O
the O
grigo, O
since O
the O
water O
in O
the O
area O
is O
excellent; O
but O
that's O
why O
we O
were O
billed O
2.50 O
euros. O

My O
wife, O
certainly, O
when O
she O
reviewed O
the O
bill B-TARGET
and O
discovered O
the O
latter, O
she O
took O
a O
good O
dislike, O
for O
we O
considered O
Casa O
Pelentós O
one O
of O
our O
few O
Pyrenean O
shelters O
for O
when O
we O
left O
home, O
since O
we O
lived O
very O
close. O

Obviously, O
for O
the O
2.50 O
euros O
charged O
for O
tap O
water, B-TARGET
they O
have O
lost O
two O
customers. O

We O
were O
having O
dinner O
in O
Colette O
yesterday. O

Excellent O
dinner! B-TARGET

It O
was O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
that O
a O
restaurant O
in O
Zaragoza O
did O
not O
surprise O
me O
in O
this O
way: O
Great O
quality O
of O
the O
product, B-TARGET
numerous O
details, B-TARGET
perfect O
cooking B-TARGET
points I-TARGET
in O
almost O
all O
dishes, O
abundant O
rations B-TARGET
and O
a O
high O
price O
but O
adjusted O
to O
the O
quality.The O
service B-TARGET
was O
attentive O
and O
polite O
although O
it O
had O
some O
small O
failure O
(like O
serving O
the O
second O
bottle O
of O
wine O
in O
the O
glasses O
in O
which O
there O
was O
still O
something O
of O
the O
previous O
one)At O
first O
a O
good O
variety O
of O
breads O
(pizza, O
olive O
green, O
black O
olive,...) O
with O
a O
bowl O
of O
olive O
oil O
with O
tomato O
mozzarella O
and O
basil. O

Appetizers O
offered O
by O
the O
house O
with O
a O
white O
martini O
cocktail O
cooled O
with O
liquid O
nitrogen O
and O
a O
pill O
of O
foie O
mi-cuit O
wrapped O
in O
raspberry O
with O
cider O
and O
coconut O
cotton. O

Very O
successful O
both. O

As O
starters O
we O
share:- O
a O
Kobe B-TARGET
ox I-TARGET
carpaccio, I-TARGET
excellent, O
savoury.- O
a O
tempura O
of O
diners O
filled O
with O
foie O
and O
artichokes O
- O
a O
whole O
tail O
of O
lobster O
grilled O
with B-TARGET
salsa I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
its I-TARGET
coral I-TARGET
(very O
tasty, O
although O
a O
little O
past O
stitch)Before O
the O
second O
the O
house O
offered O
us O
a O
pinco O
of O
quince O
and O
cheese O
in O
tempura O
presented O
in O
a O
burning O
cinnamon O
stick. O

Very O
original O
presentation B-TARGET
and O
very O
successful O
combination. B-TARGET
The O
second O
ones O
were O
a O
little O
more O
traditional: O

- O
Porridge O
with O
foie O
and O
seasonal O
mushrooms: O
gigantic O
ration O
and O
point O
exactly O
as O
requested, O
unusual O
thing. O

- O
Barrete O
at O
low O
temperature O
with O
caramelized O
sauce O
and O
truffled O
puree. O

Extraordinary O
taste B-TARGET
and O
texture. B-TARGET

- O
Rape O
with O
couscous O
and O
chipiron. O

Great O
taco B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cooked O
rape O
at O
its O
point O
and O
very O
tasty. O

- O
Pigeon. O

Just O
the O
breasts. O

Perhaps O
it O
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
less O
done, O
but O
very O
tasty O
and O
also O
accompanied O
by O
an O
excellent O
puree. B-TARGET

Another O
entertainment O
of O
the O
house O
before O
dessert O
with O
some O
crumbs O
with O
dehydrated O
strawberries O
and O
candied O
with O
vanilla O
soup O
(served O
in O
a O
glass O
of O
dry O
ice O
to O
make O
a O
bubbling O
volcano O
effect). O

Spectacular O
and O
very O
tasty. O

We O
only O
asked O
for O
two O
desserts B-TARGET
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
they O
were O
the O
loosest O
of O
dinner: O

- O
An O
apple O
crispy O
cake O
with O
vanilla O
ice O
cream.- O
A O
chocolate O
coulant O
with O
brown O
glacé O
ice O
cream. O

When O
we O
were O
finishing O
the O
coffees, O
they O
brought O
us O
some O
cupcakes. O

There O
they O
stayed O
most, O
they O
were O
quite O
normal O
and O
we O
could O
no O
longer.In O
short O
280 O
€ O
for O
4 O
people O
including O
two O
bottles O
of O
Enate O
Merlot-merlot O
(which O
contributed O
60 O
€ O
to O
the O
account)I O
think O
an O
account O
not O
disproportionate O
to O
the O
quality O
and O
quantity O
of O
the O
food O
and O
the O
details O
that O
they O
offered O
us. O

A O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
go. O

If O
they O
maintain O
the O
level O
of O
innovation O
and O
quality O
it O
can O
be O
a O
breath O
of O
fresh O
air O
in O
Zaragoza. O

P.D. O

So O
I O
read O
in O
previous O
comments O
they O
should O
have O
reduced O
prices, O
because O
yesterday O
the O
tempura O
of O
colmenillas O
and O
foie O
cost O
18 O
€ O
and O
not O
the O
22 O
that O
are O
mentioned O
in O
another O
comment. O

If O
so, O
well O
done. O

Very O
good O
description O
Pedro, O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
to O
the O
Colette O
restaurant, O
I O
have O
read O
some O
negative O
opinions O
and O
others O
positive, O
but O
of O
course O
from O
what O
you O
comment O
is O
highly O
recommended O
their O
cuisine. O

Although O
I'm O
a O
little O
reluctant O
to O
molecular O
cooking. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
other O
one, O
the O
q-art, O
and O
I O
came O
out O
very O
unhappy O
from O
the O
place. O
Is O
there O
a O
non-smoking O
area O
in O
the O
Colette? O

Is O
there O
a O
separation O
between O
tables? O

Hello O
JoséEn O
Colette O
do O
not O
have O
a O
non-smoking O
area. O

The O
truth O
is, O
it's O
a O
pretty O
small O
place. B-TARGET

The O
tables B-TARGET
are O
large O
and O
the O
space O
between O
them O
is O
quite O
wide. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
quite O
full O
(although O
not O
complete) O
and O
yet O
we O
were O
very O
quiet, O
with O
almost O
total O
intimacy. O

Although O
there O
were O
smokers O
at O
the O
table O
next O
door, O
we O
felt O
no O
discomfort O
during O
the O
meal. O

I O
think O
the O
ventilation B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
good, O
though O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
there O
were O
more O
smokers O
or O
more O
compulsive. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
“molecular O
kitchen”, O
don’t O
worry: O
I O
really O
like O
the O
“molecular O
kitchen”, O
but O
Colette’s O
is O
not. O

It O
is O
a O
rather O
traditional O
cuisine O
in O
concepts O
but O
blends O
them O
with O
modern O
and O
well O
applied O
cooking B-TARGET
procedures, I-TARGET
along O
with O
creative O
presentations. B-TARGET

The O
most O
remarkable O
thing O
for O
me O
is O
the O
use O
of O
low-temperature B-TARGET
cooking I-TARGET
in O
many O
dishes O
and O
spetacular O
and O
worked O
presentations. B-TARGET

Disappointing O
experience. B-TARGET
The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
that O
seems O
complete O
in O
the O
offer, O
in O
the O
international O
section O
nothing O
at O
all O
do O
not O
have O
any O
of O
the O
references. O

In O
the O
rest O
three O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
that O
we O
ask O
exhausted, O
already O
desperate O
we O
ask O
for O
a O
rioja O
that O
could O
be, O
bring O
us O
a O
Roda B-TARGET
ll I-TARGET
2004, I-TARGET
well, O
the O
wine O
presents O
hot, O
in O
the O
end O
embarrassing O
situation. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
unattractive, O
the O
Andalusian B-TARGET
squid I-TARGET
impossible, O
crystal B-TARGET
peppers I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
anchovies, I-TARGET
swimming O
in O
oil O
of O
mediocre O
quality, O
cod B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
leek I-TARGET
cream, I-TARGET
covered O
by O
an O
exaggerated O
call O
the O
rucula O
salad, O
the O
set O
of O
the O
wrong O
dish, O
lamb B-TARGET
shoulder I-TARGET
well O
in O
its O
execution, O
the O
loose O
desserts B-TARGET
very O
loose. O

The O
premises B-TARGET
aco*edor O
and O
well O
installed. O

We O
entered O
with O
great O
expectation O
and O
were O
very O
disappointed. O

Good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
cuisine. B-TARGET
But... O
being O
so O
small, O
tobacco B-TARGET
smoke I-TARGET
ruins O
your O
entire O
dinner. O

Amazing O
that O
smoking O
is O
allowed O
in O
a O
place O
like O
this. O

See O
if O
they O
change O
the O
law O
soon O
and O
we O
can O
taste O
the O
good O
cuisine B-TARGET
without O
stinking O
alterations O
like O
tobacco... B-TARGET

In O
two O
words?-a O
piece O
of O
shitIn O
more O
words?Caro, O
hortera, O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
cave, O
minimum O
rations B-TARGET
and O
dishes B-TARGET
of O
the O
most O
normal.The O
only O
thing O
of O
author, O
is O
the O
photo B-TARGET
that O
is O
really O
worthy O
of O
the O
prize O
to O
the O
shame O
of O
others, O
(...). O

A O
shame O
what O
we O
have O
been O
charged, O
the O
incoming O
ones O
have O
suggested O
and O
they O
have O
charged O
us O
9 O
euros O
for O
each O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomato. I-TARGET
We O
have O
gone O
12 O
and O
we O
have O
paid O
case O
700 O
euros O
and O
we O
have O
had O
to O
ask O
to O
be O
invited O
to O
a O
shot. O

An O
incoming B-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
dish..25 I-TARGET
euros??? O

And O
the O
bread O
we O
haven't O
asked O
for.. O
I O
recommend O
you O
all O
not O
to O
step O
on O
this O
place B-TARGET
because O
you'll O
be O
charged O
just O
for O
entering. O

For O
this O
money O
as O
real O
in O
a O
fit O
place O

It O
is O
a O
unique O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
zaragoza, O
it O
is O
small, O
comfortable O
and O
very O
private, O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
perfect O
since O
it O
makes O
it O
very O
welcoming, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
special O
and O
of O
very O
good O
quality. O

It's O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
repeat O
my O
note O
is O
9. O

Regarding O
the O
price, O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
with O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
service O
and O
exclusivity O
is O
perfect, O
but O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
with O
other O
restaurants O
of O
this O
class O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
Spain. O

Remember O
that O
zaragoza O
is O
no O

it's O

and O

what O
I O
liked O
the O
most O
was O
food B-TARGET
because O
it's O
of O

good O
quality, O
I O
hope O
that O
in O
the O
future O
it O
will O
be O
the O

that O
it O
won't O

I O

that O

know O
anything O
about O
anything. O

Greetings. O

Ernesto. O

I O
recommend O
this O
place. B-TARGET
I O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
my O
birthday, O
and O
sámi O
enchanted O
them, O
we O
will O
repeat O
for O
sure. O

Everything O
in O
small O
quantities O
but O
very O
good, O
myuy O
well O
cooked, O
and O
the O
perfect O
deal. B-TARGET

It's O
not O
to O
go O
every O
week,pq O
is O
a O
little O
more O
expensive,q O
the O
typical O
informal O
restaurant,but O
it's O
worth O
it,for O
a O
special O
celebration. O

Thank O
you! O

VERGÜENZA!!! O

I O
spoke O
to O
the O
restaurant O
the O
night O
before O
and O
very O
gently O
explained O
to O
me O
the O
3 O
menus O
they O
had O
for O
the O
week. O

I O
chose O
the O
most O
expensive O
one O
and O
reserved. O

38 O
euros O
with O
cellar O
included.The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
not O
bad: O
Iberian O
ham O
with O
bread O
with O
tomato, O
squid O
with O
peppers O
of O
standard, O
potatoes O
candied O
with O
foie O
and O
meloso O
rice O
(of O
mushrooms). O

As O
a O
second O
to O
choose O
several O
dishes O
among O
which O
were O
cod, O
rappe, O
sirloin, O
pork, O
steak O
tartar,...The O
first B-TARGET
were O
centers O
that O
to O
taste O
were O
good, O
but O
come O
on, O
scarce. O

If O
in O
the O
second B-TARGET
there O
had O
been O
a O
good O
dish O
I O
don’t O
say O
‘mu’, O
but O
no. O

Second O
a O
dish O
of O
good O
quality O
(but O
not O
exceptional) O
and O
again O
scarce O
(at O
least O
for O
the O
ratio O
of O
quality/quantity/price). O

The O
dessert... O
2 O
little O
cakes O
from O
any O
bakery O
per O
person. O

Whether O
they're O
their O
own O
or O
not, O
I O
don't O
say O
anything. O

But O
again O
scarce O
(and O
nothing O
special). O

In O
the O
end O
we O
paid: O
38 O
per O
person, O
10 O
euros O
for O
a O
tomato B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
garden I-TARGET
that O
they O
cultivated O
(offered O
suddenly O
having O
the O
menu O
closed O
and O
without O
warning O
of O
the O
price), O
2 O
euros O
for O
coffee, B-TARGET
5.5 O
per O
pacharán O
(of O
this O
I O
say O
nothing, O
if O
you O
ask O
it O
you O
pay O
it) O
and O
13 O
euros O
for O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
having O
the O
menu O
closed. O

Everything O
to O
add O
the O
iva. O

After O
taking O
an O
interest O
in O
that O
‘extra-cost’ O
of O
the O
wine O
I O
am O
told O
that O
they O
consider O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
to O
be O
every O
3 O
or O
4, O
so O
when O
I O
order O
3 O
and O
go O
6, O
I O
am O
charged O
1. O

I O
don't O
understand O
how O
they O
do O
with O
the O
couples O
that O
go. O

Summary: O
as O
the O
title O
said: O
scoundrels!!! O

You O
can't O
go O
fancy O
cheating O
and O
trying O
to O
get O
money O
out O
of O
any O
of O
the O
diners. O

I O
find O
it O
embarrassing O
that O
they O
charge O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
because O
being O
6 O
people O
on O
the O
menu O
only O
correspond O
to O
2. O

Especially O
being O
the O
price O
of O
38 O
euros O
(more O
iva) O
and O
being O
the O
food B-TARGET
rather O
scarce O
and O
without O
providing O
more O
quality O
than O
that O
of O
many O
other O
places O
at O
better O
price. O

Three O
forks? O

JAJAJA, O
I O
laugh O
at O
the O
forks. O

That's O
right, O
I'm O
laughing O
after O
they've O
laughed O
out O
of O
my O
pocket. O

EVENT O
IT O
IF O
YOU O
CAN!! O

We O
were O
having O
dinner O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
on O
Saturday, O
November O
19, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
place B-TARGET
raises O
many O
expectations, O
which O
are O
then O
disappointed O
by O
the O
food, B-TARGET
normal, O
the O
quantity O
not O
scarce, O
but O
minimal, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
insufficient, O
and O
the O
astronomical O
price. O

In O
short, O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
many O
infulas O
that O
stays O
at O
nothing. O

NOT O
RECOGNIZING O
IT O
IN O
ABSOLUTE. O

I O
really O
don't O
know, O
the O
place O
you O
all O
refer O
to, O
but O
on O
Saturday O
night, O
January O
21, O
2012, O
we O
were O
having O
dinner O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
friends O
(8 O
pax.) O

and O
we O
have O
a O
wonderful O
dinner, O
both O
in O
quality O
and O
quantity. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
up O
to O
speed, O
too. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
cozy; O
it O
was O
all O
excellent, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
those O
people O
who O
want O
to O
enjoy O
with O
elegance. O

Great O
dinner B-TARGET
Saturday O
night O
with O
a O
Groupalia O
bonus. O

Excellent O
quality O
and O
price. O

Today O
and O
tomorrow O
the O
offer O
is O
still O
there, O
but O
if O
anyone O
wants O
to O
buy O
it.40 O
€ O
for O
a O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
with O
good O
product, O
very O
well O
cooked O
and O
included O
gin-tonic, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
unbeatable.Yes, O
for O
my O
taste O
the O
best O
gin O
tonic O
without O
violet, O
although O
I O
am O
a O
lover O
of O
violet O
candy, O
better O
everything O
in O
place. O

Saturday O
night, O
I O
reserve O
for O
4 O
people O
at O
the O
colette, O
and O
when O
we O
arrive O
we O
not O
only O
have O
no O
reservation O
but O
the O
colette, O
supposedly O
of O
more O
quality O
than O
the O
Quartz, O
no O
longer O
exists O
as O
such, O
they O
tell O
us O
that O
they O
have O
merged, O
they O
are O
the O
same O
restaurant O
and O
they O
are O
looking O
for O
us O
a O
table O
at O
the O
latter. O

Without O
offering O
us O
the O
menu O
menu O
they O
give O
us O
the O
menu O
of O
dishes, O
I O
suppose O
to O
see O
if O
it O
runs, O
until O
we O
ask O
for O
the O
menus, O
which O
then O
explain O
to O
us O
the O
excellences O
of O
their O
menus, O
which O
is O
not O
of O
bad O
quality O
although O
we O
ask O
for O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
of O
the O
menu, O
since O
you O
can O
not O
choose O
color, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
does O
not O
seem O
to O
us O
according O
to O
the O
supposed O
quality O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
narrow O
and O
elongated O
so O
in O
the O
background O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
communicate O
without O
shouting O
if O
it O
is O
full, O
as O
is O
the O
case. O

I O
find O
the O
evaluation O
on O
this O
website O
excessive, O
without O
intent O
to O
discourage O
the O
restaurant, O
knowing O
what O
they O
offer. O

Only O
in O
Zaragoza, O
it's O
about O
time!!!. O

Excellent O
istalations, B-TARGET
very O
good O
attention B-TARGET
and O
unbeatable O
cuisine... B-TARGET
worth O
trying. O

I O
recommend O
it!!! O

One O
Sunday O
at O
noon O
I'll O
pay O
for O
the O
hazing O
to O
eat O
there, O
but O
one O
and O
no O
more. O

It's O
6 O
months O
old, O
we O
were O
all O
over O
the O
restaurant O
about O
13 O
people O
and O
three O
waitresses O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
WAS O
FINE O
A O
lot O
of O
white O
glove O
on O
but O
they O
leave O
you O
the O
same O
cutlery O
from O
the O
starters O
until O
desserts, O
the O
dishes O
accumulate O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
table O
and O
they O
don't O
take O
them O
away O
from O
you, O
you O
need O
bread O
and O
you O
have O
to O
almost O
beg. O

The O
few O
rations B-TARGET
for O
what O
they O
charge O
you, O
for O
example O
a O
plate O
with O
three O
bells O
with B-TARGET
foi I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
three I-TARGET
hearts I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
artichokes I-TARGET
overflowing I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
tempura I-TARGET
saberán O
22 O
euros O
and O
the O
sirloin B-TARGET
hardly O
reaches O
60 O
grams. O

That's O
if O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
faggots O
with O
acite O
tears O
but O
if O
you O
drop O
a O
cover O
or O
warn O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
if O
you O
catch O
it, O
or O
you O
clean O
it O
up. O

NOT O
RECOGNIZING O
IT. O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
on O
several O
occasions O
and O
then O
we O
have O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant.The O
food B-TARGET
appeared O
good O
to O
the O
people O
we O
have O
been O
eating, O
that O
if O
we O
have O
never O
eaten O
the O
menu, O
whenever O
we O
have O
eaten O
we O
have O
let O
ourselves O
be O
advised O
by O
the O
person O
who O
attended O
us O
at O
the O
table, O
we O
have O
usually O
shared O
some O
incomings O
and O
then O
each O
one O
to O
choose O
what O
he O
wanted.The O
truth O
is O
that O
very O
well. O

We O
also O
spent O
a O
couple O
of O
nights O
at O
the O
Spa O
with O
circuit O
and O
full O
board O
and O
of O
course O
the O
menus B-TARGET
left O
enough O
to O
be O
desired. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
guests O
also O
enter O
the O
wine, O
you O
can O
order O
it O
but O
with O
its O
corresponding O
charge O
to O
the O
habición. O

A O
shame O
for O
the O
excellent O
facilities O
there O
are. O

I O
go O
a O
lot O
to O
the O
Spa O
Paracuellos O
de O
Jiloca, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
they O
always O
give O
me O
is O
ESTUPENDA, O
they O
put O
you O
a O
lot O
of O
quantity O
and O
also O
with O
quality.The O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
very O
good. O

WE'RE O
RECOGNIZING O
EVERYONE. O

Yesterday O
I O
was O
at O
the O
Spa O
making O
a O
wrap O
in O
algae O
and O
a O
thermal O
circuit. O

I O
went O
out O
fascinated, O
in O
the O
morning O
I O
realized O
the O
wrapper, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
in O
the O
gym. O

We O
ate O
in O
the O
spa O
dining O
room O
which O
by O
the O
way O
is O
to O
congratulate O
the O
food, B-TARGET
which O
we O
ate O
well. O

In O
the O
afternoon O
we O
performed O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
that O
was O
phenomenal O
all O
afternoon O
bathing O
us. O

There's O
only O
one O
thing O
missing O
that O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
has O
water O
to O
drink O
if O
you're O
thirsty. O

I O
was O
at O
the O
Hotel O
Balneario O
Paracuellos O
de O
Jiloca, O
doing O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
in O
the O
morning O
by O
the O
way O
I O
loved O
it!!!!, O

We O
also O
ate O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
STUPENDA, O
they O
give O
you O
to O
choose O
also O
the O
food O
this O
goodisima.!!! O

; O
in O
the O
afternoon O
we O
did O
treatments O
and O
massages O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
outdoor O
pool O
and O
solarium O
a O
lot. O

A O
WONDER, O
YOU O
RECOGNIZING O
IT!!!!! O

Hi, O
I O
was O
at O
the O
Hotel O
Balneario O
Paracuellos O
in O
Jiloca, O
spending O
a O
few O
days O
and O
I O
really O
liked O
it. O

The O
attention O
of O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
of O
reception, O
of O
the O
dining O
room, O
of O
the O
spa O
is O
goodisima O
make O
you O
feel O
very O
comfortable O
and O
at O
home. O

The O
very O
good O
and O
abundant O
food B-TARGET
also O
the O
day O
before O
give O
you O
to O
choose O
that O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
the O
next O
day.We O
like O
everything O
very O
much O
and O
soon O
we O
will O
return!!! O

1/02/2012 O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
people O
can O
complain O
about O
the O
food O
in O
the O
restaurant O
of O
the O
spa, O
we O
spent O
9 O
days O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
varied O
very O
abundant O
and O
exquisite. O

The O
attention O
of O
the O
exceptional O
waitresses, B-TARGET
we O
will O
return O
if O
only O
for O
the O
attention O
received O
thanks O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
for O
your O
attention. O

It O
is O
an O
appreciation, O
but O
the O
rabbit B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
garlic, O
it O
is O
cooked O
precisely O
like O
this, O
with O
the O
olive O
of O
having O
cooked O
it, O
that O
carries O
all O
the O
flavor. O

It's O
not O
that O
he O
swims O
in O
oil, O
it's O
that O
they O
throw O
it O
so O
it O
doesn't O
stay O
dry O
and O
you O
can O
get O
wet. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
you O
don't O
like O
it. O

It O
is O
the O
spa O
where O
we O
have O
eaten O
the O
worst O
unlike O
the O
others O
I O
know, O
poor O
elaboration, B-TARGET
little O
variety B-TARGET
not O
even O
breakfasts B-TARGET
are O
appetizing O

The O
spa O
as O
such O
is O
very O
good, O
for O
that O
there O
is O
no O
complaint. O

Excellent O
thermal O
circuit. O

As O
for O
what O
food B-TARGET
is, O
honestly O
it O
is O
not O
bad. O

They're O
not O
rimmering O
dishes B-TARGET
(alhama O
de O
Aragón's O
food O
has O
already O
been O
told O
to O
me O
by O
several O
people), O
but O
they O
let O
themselves O
eat O
and O
they O
were O
fine. O

I O
remember O
asking O
for O
stewed B-TARGET
chips I-TARGET
and O
they O
were O
very O
good, O
like O
a O
seafood B-TARGET
puree I-TARGET
that O
was O
delicious. O

Even O
if O
it O
was O
more O
or O
less O
normal O
the O
rest O
(the O
spa B-TARGET
hors I-TARGET
d'oeuvres I-TARGET
are O
the O
same O
as O
those O
shown O
in O
the O
photo), O
it O
was O
allowed O
to O
eat. O

It O
won't O
be O
to O
enter O
select O
palates, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
bad. O

I O
certainly O
expected O
it O
worse O
because O
of O
the O
comments, O
but O
it O
is O
not, O
fortunately. O

Kind O
and O
correct O
service, B-TARGET
somewhat O
slow O
cooking, B-TARGET
perhaps O
there O
was O
a O
great O
occupation. O

Food, O
correct O
inbounds B-TARGET
except O
for O
the O
wrong O
skewers, B-TARGET
the O
well B-TARGET
stocked I-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
rice. I-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
very O
professional O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
good O
quality O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
a O
better O
quality/price O
ratio. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
below O
the O
above, O
but B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
set I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
good I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
highly I-TARGET
recommended I-TARGET

A O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
meal B-TARGET
more O
than O
right. O

I'd O
repeat O
the O
place B-TARGET
when O
it O
comes O
to O
having O
another O
group O
dinner. O

Good O
tasting B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
as O
well O
as O
the O
service. B-TARGET

I'll O
repeat. O

Last O
Saturday O
we O
had O
dinner O
with O
some O
friends, O
we O
were O
invited O
to O
a O
glass O
of O
cape O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
abundant, O
very O
good O
price O
quality O
ratio O
and O
the O
dining B-TARGET
very O
pleasant O
as O
well O
as O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
bad. O

We O
made O
a O
group B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
superscathed O
with O
a O
ration B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
that O
made O
it O
laugh O
to O
see O
her. O

Besides O
they O
put O
only O
one O
bottle O
of O
wine O
for O
every O
6 O
and O
charged O
us O
for O
the O
others. O

The O
lollipop B-TARGET
should O
have O
been O
great-grandfather O
because O
he O
was O
mean. O

The O
food B-TARGET
very O
good O
and O
very O
good O
deal. B-TARGET

Although O
when O
I O
got O
home O
I O
realized O
that O
I O
didn't O
get O
the O
10% O
discount O
that O
the O
reservation O
said. O

For O
meri, O
don't O
be O
such O
a O
woman, O
it's O
no O
big O
deal, O
I'm O
sure O
you're O
the O
one O
who O
likes O
to O
get O
your O
ball O
done, O
they'll O
invite O
you O
for O
shots, O
and O
they'll O
give O
it O
to O
you. O

That's O
terrible. O

The O
bartenders' B-TARGET
deal O
with O
customers O
was O
pretty O
bad: O
edges, O
bad O
faces, O
etc... O

Fatal O
food B-TARGET
and O
to O
top O
the O
price. O

It's O
expensive O
and O
you O
eat O
bad. O

I O
was O
last O
Friday O
night, O
it O
was O
incredible, O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters O
impecble O
and O
very O
friendly, O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
achieved, O
very O
recompensable O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very O
welcoming O

really O
has O
been O
a O
find, O
in O
the O
center O
of O
barcelona, O
a O
place O
where O
you O
eat O
good O
menu B-TARGET
on O
both O
working O
days O
and O
holidays. O

San O
Jordi O
has O
been O
the O
test O
with O
the O
whole O
family, O
and O
came O
out O
round, O
a O
good O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
price O
and O

good O
service B-TARGET
menu B-TARGET
excellent O

Dinner O
for O
two O
with O
a O
very O
good O
service B-TARGET
attention, O
we O
find O
a O
quiet O
and O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food, O
in O
our O
case O
a O
xato B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
to O
share O
and O
a O
duck B-TARGET
magret, I-TARGET
excellent! O

I O
recommend O
it, O
we'll O
be O
back. O

We O
presented O
ourselves O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
choosing O
à O
la O
carte O
dishes, O
but O
they O
presented O
us O
with O
a O
very O
correct O
menu B-TARGET
and O
at O
a O
tight O
price, O
so O
that O
was O
our O
selection. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
very O
correct O
in O
presentation O
quantity O
and O
flavors. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
attention O
very O
well. O

We'll O
be O
back. O

The O
attention O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
if O
you O
reserve, O
you O
should O
not O
set O
the O
table O
aside O
if O
you O
have O
noticed O
that O
the O
dining O
room O
is O
full, O
if O
not O
for O
what O
to O
reserve? O

The O
ration B-TARGET
a O
little O
short O
for O
what O
is O
charged O
per O
plate, B-TARGET
although O
well O
made. O

Very O
good O
deal, B-TARGET
very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
an O
ideal O
place O
to O
go O
menu B-TARGET
eating O
quality. O

As O
always O
they O
have O
been O
up O
to O
date, O
quality O
perfect O
price O
and O
unbeatable O
service, B-TARGET
extremely O
friendly. O

Very O
comfortable O
the O
situation B-TARGET
to O
move O
with O
public O
transport, O
metro O
and O
bus O
next O
door. O

The O
customer O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
the O
right O
one O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
price. O

Good O
care, B-TARGET
but O
the O
rest O
fatal; O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
dirt, O
it O
is O
not O
comfortable, O
the O
washbasins B-TARGET
are O
very O
dirty, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
super O
dark, O
and O
the O
kitchen O
fatal, O
food B-TARGET
without O
texture, O
very O
industrial, O
like O
a O
daily O
menu, O
at O
10,0 O
€. O

The O
opinions O
I O
read, O
before O
I O
went, O
totally O
confused O
me. O

<-> O
We O
ask O
the O
carte O
(no O
day O
menu) O
paella B-TARGET
as O
main O
dish- O
almost O
burned, O
past O
rice. O

<-> O
Dry O
prawns B-TARGET
and O
we O
don't O
know O
why, O
but O
they O
filled O
it O
with O
pieces O
of O
that O
"palo-shaped B-TARGET
pas- I-TARGET
but I-TARGET
shrimp-flavored" I-TARGET
that O
was O
almost O
rubber-impossible O
to O
eat. O

<->We O
couldn't O
eat O
half O
the O
paella B-TARGET

It's O
a O
nice O
staff. B-TARGET

passable O
starters B-TARGET
-normal O
taste O

Relation O
quality O
very O
good. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
all O
fantastic. O

We'll O
be O
right O
back. O

Well O
in O
general, O
a O
little O
slow O
service B-TARGET

Right. O

Prompt O
service B-TARGET
with O
willingness O
to O
perform. O

The O
improved O
kitchen, B-TARGET
next O
to O
excellent O
dishes O
for O
example O
cod, B-TARGET
others O
not O
as O
much O
as O
tuna, B-TARGET
too O
done.They O
correctly O
applied O
the O
promotional B-TARGET
discount. I-TARGET

Excellent O
cuisine, B-TARGET
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
ask O
for O
are O
exquisite O

Nice O
restaurant, B-TARGET
good O
atmosphere O
and O
service. B-TARGET

Extremely O
close O
the O
tables B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
without O
any O
flavor. O

Excellent O
bread. B-TARGET

Entrance B-TARGET
somewhat O
messy, O
with O
paper O
on O
the O
floor.Vibration O
of O
the O
subway O
and O
annoying O
room O
noise. O

If O
the O
food B-TARGET
had O
taste, O
the O
rest O
doesn't O
matter. O

Excellent O
location B-TARGET
and O
lighting. B-TARGET

Perfect O
value O
for O
money, O
very O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
food. B-TARGET

Totally O
recommended. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice O
and O
attentive, O
the O
arrivals B-TARGET
are O
very O
good. O

The O
paella B-TARGET
is O
good O
for O
the O
price. O

It O
was O
all O
very O
good. O

JR O

They O
didn't O
answer O
me O
and O
since O
I O
had O
to O
go, O
I O
told O
them, O
I O
sent O
a O
second O
e.mail, O
telling O
them O
to O
call O
me. O

It O
wasn't O
like O
that. O

I O
guess O
since O
it O
was O
late O
and O
S. O
Jordi's O
day O
they O
couldn't O
answer. O

But O
the O
experience O
helped O
me O
to O
get O
to O
know O
restaurants. O

excellent O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
goes O
from O
less O
to O
more O
with O
two O
really O
good O
final B-TARGET
sets. I-TARGET

The O
restaurant O
"La O
Cullera O
de O
Boix" O
is O
excellent O
for O
both O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
service, B-TARGET
we O
had O
no O
problem. O

Services B-TARGET
in O
lamentable O
condition, O
and O
tablecloths, B-TARGET
cups B-TARGET
etc. O

can O
improve O
cleaning. B-TARGET

As O
far O
as O
food B-TARGET
and O
staff O
service B-TARGET
are O
concerned, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
it O
is O
very O
correct. O

Kind O
staff B-TARGET
but O
very O
loose O
food. B-TARGET

Without O
any O
grace, O
untasteful O
rice. B-TARGET

I O
wouldn't O
recommend O
it!!! O

In O
these O
times O
we O
will O
all O
go O
for O
the O
discounts O
without O
giving O
up O
the O
quality, O
this O
restaurant O
gave O
the O
size O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
we O
chose, O
by O
the O
way, O
all O
very O
good, O
the O
very O
good O
quantities, O
the O
broth B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
we O
liked O
quite. O

The O
attention O
of O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
cozy. O

We'll O
be O
back. O

<->Nothing O

Attention B-TARGET

We're O
very O
happy. O

We O
were O
21 O
people, O
exceptional O
treatment, B-TARGET
dinner B-TARGET
was O
fine. O

The O
only O
inconvenient O
space, B-TARGET
we O
could O
barely O
move. O

Otherwise O
very O
well. O

Magnificent O
attention, B-TARGET
good O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
very O
good O
paella. B-TARGET

We'll O
repeat. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
we O
choose O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
it O
is O
very O
complete. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
bring O
the O
food, O
we O
waited O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
menu O
was O
closed O
in O
advance. O

Really O
a O
great O
disappointment, O
terrible O
service, B-TARGET
plus O
not O
only O
is O
the O
drink B-TARGET
not O
included O
but O
they O
don't O
even O
give O
you O
bread O
or O
even O
water. O

Great O
broth B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
treatment. B-TARGET

It's O
the O
second O
time O
we O
go O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
first O
time O
we O
had O
a O
bad O
experience B-TARGET
because O
of O
a O
misunderstanding O
but O
this O
last O
time O
everything O
went O
well. O

They O
treated O
us O
wonderfully O
and O
after O
dinner O
they O
gave O
a O
wooden O
spoon O
to O
each O
of O
us. O

We O
celebrated O
in O
this O
restaurant O
our O
Silver O
Weddings O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
all O
perfect, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
great O
food, B-TARGET
I O
would O
highlight O
the O
croquettes B-TARGET
of O
the O
aperitif O
(delicious) O
and O
of O
course, O
the O
paella. B-TARGET

For O
putting O
some O
but, O
maybe O
the O
ham B-TARGET
wasn't O
all O
the O
"Iberic" O
that O
could O
be O
expected. O

It's O
a O
highly O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Quiet O
place, B-TARGET
correct O
rations, B-TARGET
best O
rice B-TARGET
and O
price. O

The O
place O
has O
a O
very O
pleasant O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
exquisite. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
deal O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
seemed O
good O
and O
varied O
with O
a O
very O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
pleasant O
treatment O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
with O
a O
good O
quality O
price O
ratio. O

It O
was O
all O
great. O

We O
can't O
make O
a O
single O
complaint O
because O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
we O
entered O
until O
our O
departure O
everything O
was O
great. O

The O
exquisite O
food, B-TARGET
abundant, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
very O
pleasant. O

For O
a O
gastronomic O
menu, O
if O
the O
food O
is O
only O
good, O
not O
to O
say O
discreet O
(as O
far O
as O
paella B-TARGET
as O
the O
main O
dish O
refers) O
the O
result O
was O
somewhat O
disappointing, O
although O
the O
price O
could O
be O
considered O
exceptional. O

I O
would O
have O
improved O
with O
a O
better O
deal, O
more O
favorite O
service, B-TARGET
more O
comfortable O
table. B-TARGET

For O
example: O
paella, O
before O
placing, O
is O
it O
so O
hard O
to O
show O
it? O

are O
details O
that O
make O
you O
lose O
value.... O

I O
expected O
a O
little O
more O
of O
the O
rice, B-TARGET
otherwise O
everything O
very O
correct. O

A O
great O
menu, B-TARGET
very O
complete. O

The O
very O
good, O
very O
friendly O
treatment, B-TARGET
exquisite O
rice B-TARGET
and O
at O
half O
price, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Only O
for O
emergencies, O
not O
recommended. O

Right O
restaurant B-TARGET
without O
any O
more O
pretensions, O
abundant O
food B-TARGET
but O
without O
an O
extraordinary O
quality. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
lousy, O
slow O
and O
he O
didn't O
know O
anything. O

The O
rice B-TARGET
didn't O
surprise O
me O
either. O

I O
don't O
think O
I'll O
repeat. O

We O
attended O
the O
restaurant O
for O
a O
Christmas O
dinner O
of O
the O
company O
and O
the O
relationship O
quality O
- O
price O
we O
knew. O

Very O
good O
menu B-TARGET
and O
abbot O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
diligent O
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
(we O
were O
in O
the O
private O
room) O
pleasant. O

We O
did O
the O
work O
dinner O
and O
we O
were O
very O
well O
attended, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
of O
the O
best O
that O
we O
have O
made O
a O
day O
like O
this O
that O
the O
restaurants O
are O
filled O
with O
groups. O

They O
didn't O
lower O
the O
quality O
or O
the O
presentation. O

Although O
we O
were O
several O
groups O
we O
did O
not O
suffer O
from O
the O
noise O
and O
we O
could O
speak O
without O
shouting. O

Very O
good O
arroz B-TARGET
and O
good O
quantity. O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
people O
who O
have O
given O
their O
opinion, O
who O
are O
friends O
or O
family? O

Just O
get O
in O
an O
impressive O
smell B-TARGET
of O
unclean O
kitchen, O
then O
some O
inbounds. O

of O
fear, O
knives B-TARGET
with O
dirt, O
musclos B-TARGET
with O
flavor O
to O
"don't O
know", O
squid B-TARGET
that O
seemed O
tortillites, O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
little O
cold, O
Iberian B-TARGET
ham O
qualification O
5 O
just O
and O
finally O
the O
paella B-TARGET
very O
good O
the O
truth, O
then O
to O
finish O
the O
work O
the O
dirty O
sinks, B-TARGET
in O
the O
renfe O
I O
think O
they O
are O
cleaner, O
because O
nothing O
more O
"very O
happy", O
we O
will O
not O
return O
anymore. O

All O
right. O

It O
stings B-TARGET
and O
wine B-TARGET
very O
good. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
we've O
been O
taken O
into O
account. O

Table O
separated O
therefore, O
intimacy. O

Correct O
service B-TARGET
and O
quality. O

Excellent O
rice. B-TARGET

It's O
all O
very O
well. O

We O
were O
in O
this O
restaurant O
on O
the O
old O
night O
and O
it O
was O
all O
very O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
nice. O

The O
right O
service, B-TARGET
nice O
deal, O
price O
too. O

The O
spectacular O
rice, B-TARGET
very O
good. O

We O
prepared O
a O
dinner O
for O
Christmas O
Day O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
wasn't O
easy O
to O
find O
an O
open O
restaurant O
until O
I O
found O
this O
page. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
central, O
good O
prices O
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

We O
were O
a O
group O
of O
11 O
and O
they O
prepared O
a O
table O
a O
little O
bit O
apart O
and O
the O
tarto B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

It O
is O
worth O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
for O
32.50 O
euros O
has O
excellent O
quality. O

The O
cover B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
varied O
and O
priced O
correctly. O

For O
making O
a O
mistake O
for O
the O
short O
time O
it O
has O
been O
going O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
attracted O
by O
the O
design O
of O
the O
premises O
and O
the O
fame O
that O
is O
taking O
their O
kitchen. O

I O
spent O
Friday O
to O
meet O
him, O
I O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
design O
of O
the O
place, B-TARGET
and O
not O
to O
mention O
with O
the O
letter B-TARGET
they O
have, O
I O
tried O
among O
other O
things O
an O
egg B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
65 I-TARGET
degrees I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
dirt I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
gossip I-TARGET
that O
was O
to O
fall O
to O
the O
ground. O

The O
prices O
are O
incredibly O
reasonable. O

It's O
certainly O
worth O
it. O

Very O
modern O
and O
elegantly O
decorated O
venue. B-TARGET

the O
terrace B-TARGET
with O
chairs O
of O
director O
in O
the O
same O
line O
of O
elegance. O

Food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
very O
well O
and O
the O
price O
even O
better. O

Highly O
recommended. O

On O
Saturday O
01-11-14, O
we O
were O
having O
dinner O
with O
my O
partner O
and O
I, O
and O
another O
couple, O
and O
we O
all O
enchanted, O
I O
had O
only O
visited O
this O
place O
to O
take O
a O
lid, O
and O
as O
I O
saw O
that O
people O
spoke O
well O
of O
the O
letter, O
we O
tested O
it O
and O
indeed O
it O
was O
a O
total O
success, O
for O
a O
time O
that O
I O
did O
not O
find O
a O
place O
with O
such O
kindness O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end, O
so O
I O
can O
speak, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
we O
chose O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
and O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
the O
time B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
correct O
dishes, O
it O
took O
nothing, O
besides O
inside O
the O
menu O
all O
water, O
wine, O
coffees O
and O
even O
shots O
entered, O
I O
really O
plan O
to O
go O
back, O
and O
I O
plan O
to O
try O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
letter, O
to O
know O
if O
everything O
is, O
as O
rich O
as O
the O
menu B-TARGET
we O
took. O

I O
invite O
people O
to O
try O
and O
think O
about O
it, O
as O
it O
is O
also O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
cozy O
place. B-TARGET

If O
they O
go O
on O
like O
this, O
I O
think O
they O
can O
have O
a O
good O
future. O

The O
place B-TARGET
I O
love, O
the O
very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
the O
great O
food, B-TARGET
although O
I O
would O
highlight O
the O
egg B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
65 I-TARGET
degrees I-TARGET
and O
the O
tuna O
sashimi B-TARGET
that O
is O
to O
flirt O
and O
a O
torrija B-TARGET
that O
you O
win O
to O
repeat, O
I O
was O
there O
last O
Wednesday O
with O
some O
friends O
and O
we O
are O
clear O
that O
we O
will O
return, O
ah! O

by O
the O
way O
the O
prices O
very O
reasonable O

the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good O
and O
very O
good O
attention, B-TARGET
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
stays O
quite O
short O
of O
quantity, O
you O
need O
to O
order O
some O
more O
dish O
and O
that O
raises O
the O
price, O
since O
the O
rations B-TARGET
are O
very O
fair O

All O
right. O

Great O
dinner, B-TARGET
excellent O
deal. B-TARGET

The O
menu B-TARGET
has O
very O
appetizing O
dishes, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
decide O
and O
the O
deal B-TARGET
is O
right. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
it O
took O
them O
a O
long O
time O
to O
attend O
to O
us O
and O
that O
little O
details O
such O
as O
a O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
are O
missing. O

Some O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
did O
not O
have O
the O
quality O
we O
expected O
(like O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
octopus O
) O
and O
we O
could O
not O
taste O
the O
tuna O
because O
they O
were O
finished.. O

The O
price O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
high O
but O
it's O
a O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

We O
really O
like O
the O
place, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
attention B-TARGET
We O
take O
the O
menu B-TARGET
tasting I-TARGET
and O
it O
is O
worth, O
the O
rations B-TARGET
are O
not O
generous O
but O
you O
don't O
go O
hungry, O
just O
a O
paste: O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
warmedVery O
recommended O
for O
those O
who O
seek O
quality O
and O
not O
quantityThere O
are O
also O
no O
surprises O
that O
if O
I O
charge O
you O
more O
for O
ordering O
another O
bottle O
of O
wine O
or O
bread......More O
coffee O
and O
shot O
included O
in O
the O
34€/person O

I O
was O
having O
dinner O
last O
night, O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
it, O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
in O
fact O
we O
congratulated O
the O
cook B-TARGET
(I O
think O
his O
name O
was O
Caesar). O

The O
problem O
may O
have O
been O
that O
instead O
of O
ordering O
the O
tasting O
menu, O
we O
threw O
out O
a O
menu, O
and O
honestly, O
it O
seemed O
a O
little O
expensive O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
rations, O
namely, O
an O
octopus O
roasted O
with O
prawns, O
a O
bluefin O
tuna O
with O
teriyaki O
and O
seaweed, O
a O
steak O
tartare, O
an O
ice O
cream O
ferret O
rocher, O
the O
torrija O
with O
ice O
cream, O
two O
waters, O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
a O
beer O
53 O
euros O
in O
total. O

My O
companion O
had O
already O
had O
dinner O
and O
just O
pecked O
at O
my O
dishes O
for O
trying O
them, O
i.e. O
except O
dessert O
and O
drinks, O
only O
I O
had O
dinner. O

And O
while O
I O
repeat O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
correct, O
even O
above O
the O
average O
of O
what O
is O
eaten O
in O
many O
places, O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
rations B-TARGET
was O
fair. O

Some O
will O
rightly O
say O
that O
53 O
euros O
for O
five O
dishes O
is O
not O
expensive O
if O
they O
are O
good, O
but O
today O
the O
restaurant O
has O
changed O
a O
lot, O
and O
you O
can O
eat O
very O
well O
for O
more O
affordable O
prices O
in O
other O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city, O
among O
them O
some O
of O
those O
that O
Mr O
Aranda O
comments O
on O
this O
blog. O

I O
insist O
that O
dinner O
was O
actually O
for O
a O
person, O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
wine. O

Next O
time O
I'll O
order O
the O
tasting O
menu, O
and O
I O
guess O
it'll O
come O
out O
much O
cheaper, O
and O
it'll O
improve O
the O
value O
for O
money. O

In O
any O
case O
an O
interesting O
place B-TARGET
to O
dine, O
specifically O
octopus B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
prawns, I-TARGET
delicious. O

We O
ordered O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
the O
truth O
was O
all O
very O
good. O

The O
fine O
truffled B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
cannelloni I-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
egg B-TARGET
and O
dessert. B-TARGET

We'll O
come O
back O
without O
hesitation. O

We O
walked O
down O
that O
street O
and O
walked O
into O
the O
Double O
One O
just O
because O
we O
wanted O
to O
cover O
something O
up. O

We O
didn't O
know O
him O
and O
we O
didn't O
expect O
anything O
special. O

The O
surprise O
was O
tremendous O
when O
we O
tried O
the O
first O
cover O
and O
went O
on O
with O
the O
others. O

Good O
quality O
and O
reasonable O
price. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
the O
next O
day O
we O
went O
to O
dinner. O

We O
order O
spinach O
salad, O
mushroom O
rissotto O
and O
octopus O
with O
prawns. O

Unbelievable. O

It O
is O
not O
common O
to O
find O
such O
quality O
today O
and O
that O
is O
appreciated. O

The O
only O
“but” O
is O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
between O
plate O
and O
plate, O
but O
I O
understand O
that O
it O
is O
not O
excessive O
if O
we O
take O
into O
account O
that O
the O
dishes O
are O
very O
elaborate O
and O
made O
at O
the O
moment. O

For O
I O
disagree O
with O
the O
previous O
communicator O
I O
usually O
eat O
a O
lot O
in O
the O
Frances O
and O
although O
it O
is O
true O
that O
something O
has O
fallen O
the O
quality O
continues O
to O
eat O
well, O
abundant O
and O
in O
a O
cozy O
place B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
it O
because O
nevertheless O
it O
continues O
to O
eat O
well O
it O
is O
true O
that O
it O
misses O
jose O
the O
owner, O
now O
there O
are O
the O
children O
and O
always O
loses O
something O
when O
passing O
from O
euna O
generation O
to O
another O

to O

q O
as O
the O
chosen O

not O
like O
us O
changed O
it O
without O

It O
is O
not O
a O
comment O
to O
the O
restaurant O
what O
I O
want O
to O
do, O
but O
an O
appreciation O
to O
your O
comment. O

You O
say O
that O
for O
that O
price O
you O
have O
to O
eat O
well. O

I O
believe O
that O
wherever O
meals O
are O
served O
you O
have O
to O
eat O
well O
they O
charge O
you O
what O
they O
charge O
you, O
or O
is O
it O
that O
with O
a O
cheap O
price O
it O
is O
justified O
to O
put O
something O
inedible O
to O
you? O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
then O
it's O
a O
scam. O

If O
you O
serve O
potato O
tortilla O
it O
has O
to O
be O
good O
they O
charge O
you O
2 O
euros O
or O
charge O
you O
100, O
the O
increase O
of O
the O
price O
will O
be O
due O
to O
other O
factors O
such O
as O
professionalism, O
numbers O
of O
tables O
per O
waiter, O
decoration O
of O
the O
premises O
and O
other O
factors O
external O
to O
the O
food O
itself. O

A O
greeting, O
and O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
criticism. O

Yes O
Manolo, O
you O
are O
right, O
I O
have O
not O
explained O
myself O
well, O
I O
wanted O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
low O
price O
to O
be O
able O
to O
give O
everything O
for O
“good”, O
that O
you O
have O
to O
demand O
a O
little O
more. O

Say O
hello. O

Hello, O
Communicate O
that O
you O
can O
already O
remove O
it O
from O
the O
list, O
since O
it O
has O
been O
closed O
for O
a O
month. O

greeting O

For O
both O
pleasure O
and O
work, O
I O
have O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
a O
few O
times. O

It O
stands O
out O
in O
everything O
it O
offers O
and O
makes O
it O
outstanding O
with O
meat B-TARGET
and O
fish. B-TARGET

Absolutely O
recommended. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
professional O
restaurants B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza. O

I O
have O
visited O
it O
several O
times O
and O
I O
must O
highlight O
the O
excellent O
quality O
of O
the O
raw O
material B-TARGET
and O
the O
know-how O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

You O
can O
find O
from O
a O
well-worked O
steak, B-TARGET
through O
a O
few O
fish B-TARGET
at O
the O
right O
point O
or O
go O
to O
more O
elaborate O
menus, B-TARGET
full O
of O
flavor O
and O
contrasts O
without O
adulterations O
in O
the O
taste. O

Fantastic O
value O
for O
money. O

Absolutely O
recommended. O

Mireya O

Book O
and O
I've O
been O
eating O
with O
a O
good O
friend. O

We O
were O
guided O
and O
offered O
to O
share O
cod O
fritters O
with O
quince O
alioli O
and O
grilled O
squid. O

Main O
dishes O
include O
"fideus O
rosejats" O
and O
a O
hake O
trunk O
to O
the O
donostiarra; O
for O
dessert O
the O
famous O
"tyramisú" O
of O
the O
house O
and O
a O
caramelized O
apple O
pie O
with O
vanilla O
ice O
cream. O

It's O
all O
great. O

I O
asked O
Sala's O
manager O
for O
the O
chef O
to O
put O
more O
garnish O
on O
the O
garnish O
with O
hake O
garlic. O

So O
he O
did O
and O
the O
result O
was O
spectacular. O

To O
drink: O
a O
wine O
that O
recommends O
the O
house, O

Rioja B-TARGET
(divine O
and O
an O
"excellent" O
crop). O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
safest O
values O
of O
Catalan O
cuisine O
in O
Barcelona. O

He O
is O
always O
superb O
in O
his O
food B-TARGET
and O
perfect O
in O
his O
service. B-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
also O
wonderful. O

You O
can't O
ask O
for O
more. O

It's O
been O
a O
while O
since O
I've O
been O
gone O
and O
the O
experience B-TARGET
has O
been O
very O
disappointing. O

Extremely O
expensive O
by O
the O
type O
of O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Oily O
croquettes, B-TARGET
insulse O
marinated B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
scarce O
transparent O
foils, O
artichokes B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
hard O
clams O
and O
nursery O
sodas O
when O
the O
price O
of O
the O
dish O
was O
28€, O
the O
carpaccio B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
rape I-TARGET
testimonial. O

The O
treatment O
of O
the O
maitre B-TARGET
who O
took O
note O
of O
us O
was O
of O
very O
little O
impressive O
professionalism O
and O
brushing O
the O
bad O
manners. O

Ever O
since O
I O
found O
out O
a O
few O
years O
ago, O
whenever O
I O
go O
to O
barcelona, O
I'm O
going O
to O
live. O

I O
love O
it. O

A O
highly O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
more O
than O
acceptable. O

Something O
expensive O
but O
certainly O
highly O
recommended O
to O
eat O
well O
in O
Barcelona. O

I'd O
rather O
not O
think O
about O
the O
disappointment O
I O
had. O

I O
started O
the O
day O
with O
a O
good O
foot O
and O
continued O
to O
choose O
the O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat, O
chat O
with O
friends O
and O
be O
well O
attended. O

The O
place B-TARGET
helps O
you O
to O
get O
you O
to O
exchange O
ideas O
with O
those O
who O
share O
the O
table O
given O
the O
low O
tone O
in O
which O
the O
diners O
keep O
their O
conversations. O

Excellent O
service. B-TARGET

Attentive, O
educated, O
discreet, O
all O
who O
attended O
us O
and O
when O
we O
were O
fired O
they O
came O
to O
give O
us O
the O
last O
goodbye O
and O
the O
"until O
next O
time." O
We O
promised O
to O
return O
but O
that O
time O
with O
many O
more O
friends O
to O
whom, O
previously, O
we O
will O
have O
informed O
of O
that O
lunch O
that O
rounded O
us O
an O
unforgettable O
Saturday. O

Thank O
you. O

It's O
very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We've O
already O
been O
to O
the O
previous O
one O
on O
Muntaner O
Street. O

This O
is O
much O
more O
elegant, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
very O
correct O
and O
the O
atmosphere O
makes O
you O
feel O
very O
comfortable. O

Quality O
food. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
the O
overlaid B-TARGET
calçots. I-TARGET

We'll O
definitely O
repeat. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
great O
food. B-TARGET

But O
the O
woman O
who O
was O
the O
cashier B-TARGET
who O
received O
us O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
spoke O
to O
us O
in O
Catalan O
even O
realizing O
that O
we O
did O
not O
understand. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
very O
bad O
taste O
since O
I O
have O
never O
had O
that O
problem O
in O
Barcelona O
and O
this O
has O
had O
an O
impact O
on O
my O
appreciation O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We've O
eaten O
quite O
well. O

The O
first B-TARGET
good, O
the O
excellent O
meat. B-TARGET

It O
is O
closer O
to O
45 O
than O
30 O
euros. O

The O
exquisite O
treat. B-TARGET

You O
can O
tell O
they've O
been O
around O
for O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
and O
they're O
missing O
a O
little O
filming, O
but O
they're O
looking O
forward O
to O
liking O
each O
other O
to O
win O
the O
clientele. O

If O
they O
don't O
lower O
their O
guard, O
they O
may O
be O
working. O

I O
wish O
you O
good O
luck. O

PD: O
It O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Darin's O
movie, O
only O
they O
liked O
the O
name. O

You O
should O
check O
the O
serving O
rations: B-TARGET
they O
are O
really O
scarce!! O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
unique O
paste O
the O
already O
mentioned; O
very O
"minimalist" O
rations. B-TARGET

For O
this O
very O
reason O
I O
do O
not O
give O
a O
10 O
in O
"quality-price", O
although O
the O
quality O
is O
excellent. O

Yesterday O
we O
were O
in O
Aragon O
for O
lunch. O

The O
reservation O
without O
any O
problem, O
the O
unbeatable O
attention, B-TARGET
asking O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
in O
order O
and O
the O
point O
of O
the O
food. O

Highlight O
the O
presentation, O
all O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
very O
good. O

And O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
decorated, O
simple, O
but O
elegant. O

We O
had O
a O
menu O
that O
was O
25 O
euros, O
but O
with O
supplement O
for O
some O
dishes. O

My O
companion O
a O
soup B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
onion, I-TARGET
which O
textured O
and O
tasted O
were O
very O
good, O
but O
it O
seemed O
little, O
because O
in O
a O
few O
tablespoons O
you O
just O
eat O
it O
right O
away. O

And O
second O
hake B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
clams I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
green I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
which O
were O
few O
pieces, O
but O
of O
first O
quality O
and O
very O
good. O

While O
he O
appreciated O
that O
they O
were O
not O
very O
large O
amounts, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
is O
usually O
eaten O
at O
home. O

I O
asked O
foie B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
toast, I-TARGET
that O
the O
amount O
was O
more O
than O
correct, O
although O
there O
were O
few O
toasts O
for O
the O
amount O
that O
was O
foie. O

Very O
good O
taste, O
in O
any O
case. O

And O
the O
second, O
ternasco B-TARGET
shoulder, O
of O
size O
a O
scarce O
peline O
(it O
was O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
round) O
and O
very O
rich. O

However, O
I O
who O
am O
to O
eat O
enough, O
gave O
me O
the O
feeling O
of O
eating O
little. O

We O
both O
order O
dessert, O
Calanda O
peach. O

Very O
good O
and O
with O
lemon O
ice O
cream. O

What O
does O
give O
me O
the O
feeling O
is O
that O
I O
ate O
little. O

Which O
I O
didn't O
starve, O
but O
the O
rations B-TARGET
were O
small O
compared O
to O
the O
price. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
with O
our O
rations, O
but O
it O
wasn't. O

I O
saw O
for O
example O
a O
plate O
of O
green B-TARGET
beans I-TARGET
that O
was O
a O
very O
very O
small O
amount O
that O
were O
the O
neighboring O
diners O
that O
we O
had O
next O
to O
us. O

After O
tasting O
several O
restaurants, O
I O
was O
disappointed O
in O
my O
hair. O

I O
know O
that O
you O
can't O
compare O
Aragonia O
with O
the O
Chema O
winery, O
the O
Broth O
Roast O
or O
the O
Philoxera, O
but O
instead O
with O
the O
DGusta O
in O
Utebo O
I O
did O
stay O
much O
more O
satiated O
and O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
having O
eaten O
more O
and O
for O
a O
similar O
price. O

I O
mean, O
a O
restaurant, O
when O
you're O
satisfied, O
you O
feel O
like O
coming O
back. O

That's O
not O
the O
case O
with O
Aragonia. O

It O
is O
very O
good O
the O
place, B-TARGET
beautifully O
presented, O
unbeatable O
service, B-TARGET
good O
products B-TARGET
and O
top O
quality, O
but O
low O
amounts B-TARGET
from O
my O
point O
of O
view, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
to O
eat O
a O
lot. O

Greetings. O

We O
dine O
very O
well, O
the O
Montecito O
menu, O
the O
great O
attention,The B-TARGET
very O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
500cc, I-TARGET
is O
left O
scarce O
for O
dinner. O

It's O
the O
only O
thing O
reviewable, O
should O
be O
750cc,Good O
quality-price O
I O
recommend O

I O
was O
last O
Saturday O
having O
dinner O
and O
I O
must O
congratulate O
both O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
attended O
us O
and O
of O
course O
the O
food. B-TARGET

A O
very O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
well O
attended, O
very O
nice O
staff, B-TARGET
well O
served O
and O
unwaited O
food B-TARGET
and O
charming O
place. B-TARGET

We'll O
be O
back. O

(Cow B-TARGET

was O
delicious) O

acceptable. O

very O
well O
cut O
the O

of O
good O
quality. O

pretty O
well O
the O
rest O

in. I-TARGET

Improved O

as O
ribs O
are O

and O

are O
included. O

All O
right, O
all O
right. O

Service B-TARGET
well O
environment B-TARGET
very O
pleasant, O
really O
recommended O
we O
can O
repeat O
sure.As O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
ratio O
good O
quality, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
well O
served O
and O
with O
enough O
quantity, O
we O
did O
not O
stay O
hungry, O
we O
were O
three O
people.Only O
comment O
that O
surely O
by O
the O
time O
it O
was O
almost O
5 O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
the O
embers B-TARGET
should O
not O
be O
at O
their O
point O
since O
both O
the O
cow's B-TARGET
entrecot I-TARGET
and O
the O
ternasco B-TARGET
did O
not O
have O
the O
presence O
of O
is O
first O
heat O
stroke O
that O
puts O
them O
golden. O

They O
were O
good O
but O
I O
ate O
better O
embers. B-TARGET

For O
the O
rest O
everything O
perfect, O
I O
recommend O
it O
and O
put O
it O
among O
my O
favorites. O

Yesterday O
we O
celebrated O
the O
communion O
of O
our O
daughter, O
it O
was O
a O
rainy O
day, O
but O
I O
don't O
care O
because O
we O
the O
preparations O
were O
outstanding, O
both O
in O
the O
local B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
demas, O
the O
attention B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters O
was O
remarkable O
the O
food O
was O
all O
great.The O

you O
very O
much O
for O
everything O
you O
are O
the O
best. O

Second O
Feast O
of O
Communion O
that O
I O
have O
to O
spend O
at O
the O
Junquera. O

Nice O
treatment, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
came O
at O
its O
point.... O

Pity O
of O
the O
time O
that O
did O
not O
allow O
us O
to O
enjoy O
the O
extraordinary O
terraces O
with O
which O
the O
establishment O
counts. O

I O
went O
to O
lunch O
with O
my O
parents O
today, O
and O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed. O

The O
food B-TARGET
has O
been O
most O
common O
compared O
to O
the O
price, O
45€ O
per O
person. O

I O
think O
that O
in O
those O
prices O
you O
have O
to O
be O
more O
demanding O
both O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
menu O
and O
above O
all O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Waiters B-TARGET
with O
little O
experience O
and O
little O
preparation O
for O
the O
price O
paid. O

I'm O
not O
coming O
back. O

The O
site B-TARGET
is O
very O
welcoming O
and O
price O
quality O
ratio O
well. O

I O
recommend O
it O
very O
happy. O

about O

The O
best O
appetizer. B-TARGET

We O
were O
on O
January O
14th, O
we O
ordered O
à O
la O
carte, O
with O
water, O
mid-range O
wine. O

the O
place B-TARGET
likes O
of O
entrance O
but O
does O
not O
become O
cozy, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
what O
I O
care O
the O
most, O
I O
look O
more O
at O
the O
room O
service O
and O
kitchen. O
the O
room O
service, B-TARGET
correct, O
(just O
that, O
one O
person O
is O
missing, O
for O
the O
price O
that O
is O
paid). O

the O
bread B-TARGET
: O
scarce O
in O
its O
varieties, O
and O
very O
simple, O
without O
any O
kind O
of O
flavors, O
flours O
or O
fruits. O
we O
begin: O
the O
water, B-TARGET
we O
do O
not O
ask O
for O
any O
rare, O
since O
nobody O
gave O
us O
the O
option, O
they O
took O
out O
the O
bottled O
water O
in O
plastic O
(ununderstandable). O

We O
started O
with O
a O
cold B-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
apple O
crisps, O
scarce, O
it O
would O
result O
too O
much, O
(of O
shame) O
would O
carry O
30 O
grs O
of O
foie, O
the O
most O
correct O
; O
egg B-TARGET
poche I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
trigues, I-TARGET
correct, O
sufficient O
quantity, O
but O
like O
all O
the O
food, O
flat, O
insulsa, O
without O
flavors. O
iberic B-TARGET
prey, I-TARGET
just O
ratio, O
but O
tasty, O
as O
I O
have O
commented O
before O
everything O
soso O
(we O
are O
people O
that O
we O
never O
add O
salt O
to O
the O
meals O
in O
all O
these O
restaurants O
) O
hake, B-TARGET
an O
impressive O
ratio, O
both O
in O
size O
and O
point O
of O
cooking, O
dull O
also, O
but O
recommended. O

the O
desserts, B-TARGET
do O
not O
bring O
anything O
new, O
simple, O
good O
but O
nothing O
more. O
to O
the O
coffees, B-TARGET
no O
pettite O
fours, O
( O
lamentable O
for O
175 O
€ O
of O
two O
people, O
without O
charging O
us O
the O
coffees). O

Called O
by O
fame O
and O
star O
Michelin O
we O
went O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
Bal O
d’Onsera. O

We O
were O
already O
going O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
ordering O
the O
tasting O
menu O
and O
so O
we O
did. O

The O
first O
surprise O
was O
that O
they O
didn't O
ask O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
have O
an O
aperitif, O
but O
what O
surprised O
us O
most O
when O
they O
asked O
us O
for B-TARGET
gas I-TARGET
water I-TARGET
told O
us O
that O
they O
hadn't O
run O
out. O

I O
found O
it O
unforgivable O
for O
a O
restaurant O
with O
aspirations. O

It O
was O
all O
about O
having O
gone O
out O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
any O
supermarket O
to O
buy. O

Very O
bad O
organization.By O
this O
time O
we O
were O
already O
getting O
settled O
in O
the O
chairs, B-TARGET
very O
modern O
but O
difficult. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
eight O
dishes: O
an O
aperitif, O
3 O
starters, O
2 O
seconds O
and O
two O
desserts. O

The O
most O
remarkable O
thing O
for O
me O
were O
the O
excellent O
vegetables B-TARGET
that O
accompanied O
all O
the O
dishes, O
with O
a O
few O
short O
and O
tight O
cooking O
points, O
very O
in O
the O
line O
of O
Martín O
Berasategui. O

Extraordinary O
work O
in O
this O
area. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
textures I-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty, O
although O
the O
foam B-TARGET
was O
somewhat O
harsh. O

Asparagus, B-TARGET
green B-TARGET
beans, O
cauliflower O
cream, B-TARGET
broccoli, B-TARGET
all O
very O
well O
treated. O

The O
very O
balanced O
combinations, B-TARGET
perhaps O
the O
one O
that O
said O
the O
least O
was O
the O
tomato B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
marinated I-TARGET
tuna, I-TARGET
but O
the O
lobster B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
poché B-TARGET
egg, I-TARGET
much O
better. O

Of O
course, O
a O
little O
repetitive O
the O
eggs, B-TARGET
in O
the O
first O
three O
dishes. O

The O
hake B-TARGET
well O
knit, O
although O
a O
little O
dull, O
gave O
way O
to O
what O
for O
me O
was O
the O
surprise O
of O
the O
day, O
an O
exquisite O
piece O
of O
pimpleton B-TARGET
of O
flavor O
and O
at O
its O
just O
point O
of O
cooking O
that O
left O
me O
wanting O
more.The O
desserts B-TARGET
approved O
justito, O
the O
first O
around O
the O
red O
wine, O
with O
a O
sorbet B-TARGET
for O
me O
too O
dominated O
by O
cinnamon O
and O
with O
a O
foam B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
again O
too O
consistent. O

Below O
is O
a O
variety O
of O
peach O
textures O
with O
muscat. O

Very O
successful O
the O
ears B-TARGET
and O
the O
sorbet. B-TARGET
Another O
negative O
point O
in O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
that O
I O
tried O
to O
drink O
a O
sweet O
wine O
and O
the O
answer O
was O
disappointing. O

On O
the O
first O
occasion O
I O
was O
told O
that O
they O
had O
“one O
muscatel O
and O
two O
others O
that O
I O
forgot O
the O
name.” O

In O
the O
end O
I O
could O
have O
a O
drink O
of O
Pedro O
Ximénez.With O
the O
coffee, B-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
good, O
there O
was O
no O
accompaniment, O
poor, O
very O
poor O
for O
this O
level O
of O
restaurant. O

The O
wine O
with O
which O
we O
accompanied O
the O
meal O
was O
an O
Atteca B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
Calatayud, I-TARGET
recommendation O
of O
the O
house, O
excellent. O

As O
a O
curiosity, O
the O
bottle O
labeled O
only O
in O
English O
and O
French!In O
short: O
very O
good O
technical O
level, O
mastery O
of O
cooking O
points O
and O
great O
professionalism O
in O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
aesthetically O
modern O
combinations B-TARGET
but O
quite O
conservative O
as O
far O
as O
flavors O
are O
concerned O
- O
except O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
vegetables. B-TARGET

To O
emphasize O
that O
all O
prices O
include O
VAT, O
a O
detail O
that O
should O
be O
mandatory. O

As O
for O
defects: O
The O
quantities, B-TARGET
too O
few. O

In O
desserts B-TARGET
the O
absence O
of O
chocolate O
seems O
personally O
unforgivable, O
but O
that O
is O
already O
a O
personal O
matter. O

The O
worst, O
for O
me, O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
fair, O
with O
some O
serious O
failure O
such O
as O
water B-TARGET
or O
sweet B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
it O
was O
not O
up O
to O
a O
star. O

In O
general O
I O
expected O
more, O
it O
is O
still O
very O
far O
from O
Las O
Torres O
or O
Lillas O
Pastia O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
below O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Zaragoza O
without O
star. O

Thank O
you O
Pedro O
for O
this O
synthesis O
of O
your O
visit O
to O
the O
restaurant O
Bal O
d’ O
Onsera, O
I O
am O
with O
you O
that O
a O
high O
level O
restaurant O
is O
more O
than O
a O
good O
cuisine, O
it O
must O
be O
accompanied O
by O
these O
many O
other O
services O
such O
as O
having O
products O
like O
sweet O
wines O
or O
water O
with O
gas O
as O
well O
as O
you O
comment. O

I O
ate O
this O
Tuesday, O
and O
wonderfully; O
as O
always. O

True O
to O
my O
tradition O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
I O
didn't O
ask O
and O
let O
them O
feed O
me O
and O
drink O
me. O

Congratulations O
to O
Bal O
D’Onsera O
for O
keeping O
his O
Michelin O
star O
in O
2010 O
and O
I O
regret O
that O
it O
was O
removed O
from O
the O
Pastia O
Hill. O

Now O
it O
is O
worth O
taking O
a O
closer O
look O
at O
the O
comments O
or O
criticisms O
of O
the O
“culinary O
experts”. O

I O
wish O
there O
were O
more O
Michelin O
star O
restaurants O
in O
Zaragoza; O
it O
would O
be O
very O
good O
for O
everyone! O

My O
mother, O
who O
is O
devoid O
of O
a O
chronicle, O
and O
a O
few O
go, O
see O
that O
I O
was O
not O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
Bal O
D’Onsera, O
nor O
did O
I O
understand O
that O
he O
was O
granted O
the O
star O
Michelín, O
I O
stop O
having O
a O
terrible O
lack O
of O
criterion, O
or O
to O
enter O
with O
the O
prejudices O
to O
the O
flower O
of O
skin O
to O
value O
it O
with O
two O
cachirulos, O
and O
more O
after O
qualifying O
the O
dishes O
as O
subtle, O
very O
good, O
refreshing, O
excellent O
or O
daring, O
most O
of O
them. O

By O
the O
way, O
in O
anecdotal O
way, O
you O
say O
because O
it O
was O
left O
without O
touching O
one O
of O
the O
dishes, O
if O
it O
was O
because O
it O
was O
incompensable, O
or O
one O
had O
special O
aversion O
to O
the O
calf's O
nose, O
that O
by O
the O
way, O
if O
I O
return O
a O
dish, O
the O
last O
thing O
I O
want O
is O
to O
have O
to O
give O
explanations, O
if O
I O
think O
it O
convenient O
to O
give O
them, O
I O
will O
give O
them O
on O
my O
own O
initiative. O

PD: O
I O
guess O
this O
restaurant O
won't O
regret O
not O
being O
in O
the O
center O
like O
Novodabo O
(as O
much O
as O
it O
weighed O
to O
the O
Cachirulo O
or O
the O
Dgusta, O
by O
the O
way). O

PD2: O
Wine O
costs O
all O
restaurants O
the O
same, O
but O
not O
all O
of O
them O
keep O
the O
same, O
not O
all O
have O
the O
same O
means O
(and O
costs) O
for O
their O
conservation, O
nor O
for O
their O
service, O
nor O
do O
they O
have O
a O
wide O
offer O
(and O
immobilized) O
to O
satisfy O
the O
most O
demanding O
customers O
in O
this O
section, O
nor O
do O
they O
all O
have O
the O
same O
concern O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
having O
qualified O
and O
trained O
staff, O
attentive O
to O
go O
to O
courses O
and O
events O
to O
give O
this O
section O
the O
importance O
that O
they O
give O
to O
it, O
which O
is O
certainly O
far O
from O
demanding O
Aragonese O
cavas O
in O
the O
letter, O
which O
for O
the O
most O
part O
is O
like O
ordering O
dry-cleansing O
in O
the O
letter. O

I'm O
so O
glad O
you O
didn't O
like O
the O
chronicle, O
or O
some O
others. O

That O
tells O
me O
I'm O
on O
the O
right O
line, O
not O
selling O
myself O
to O
the O
easy O
populism O
of O
praising O
model O
restaurants. O

Precisely O
in O
this O
article O
I O
have O
tried O
to O
explain O
why O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
value O
the O
dishes O
very O
well, O
for O
example, O
without O
being O
incongruent O
with O
a O
negative O
final O
appraisal O
of O
my O
visit, O
it O
seems O
that O
I O
have O
not O
achieved O
it, O
I O
have O
even O
put O
a O
simple O
formula, O
linear O
to O
not O
mess O
up O
more. O

I'm O
sorry O
I O
can't O
explain O
it O
any O
more O
clearly, O
however O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
about O
the O
intelligence O
of O
readers, O
which O
is O
certainly O
far O
superior O
to O
what O
some O
people O
think.Some O
dates O
ago O
I O
commented O
on O
the O
value O
of O
the O
wine O
stock, O
which O
must O
be O
paid O
for, O
but O
as O
life O
has O
some O
limits, O
I O
won't O
repeat O
myself. O

I O
want O
to O
think O
that O
you O
are O
not O
Aragonese O
when O
you O
compare O
the O
cava O
of O
Aragon O
with O
the O
dry-cleaning O
(which O
I O
don't O
know O
very O
well O
with O
what O
I O
mean, O
but O
it O
seems O
scornful). O

Do O
we O
not O
have O
the O
right O
of O
the O
Aragonese O
to O
defend O
our O
own? O
I O
say O
yes, O
and O
any O
one O
who O
despises O
him, O
at O
least O
one O
servant, O
will O
not O
take O
a O
smile. O

If O
you O
just O
stopped O
to O
value O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
stock, O
we O
didn't O
get O
started. O

If O
you O
think O
that O
considering O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
Aragonese O
cava O
is, O
enophilically O
speaking, O
tiny, O
is O
proof O
that O
I O
am O
not O
Aragonese, O
badly O
continuous, O
and O
if O
you O
consider O
that O
the O
gastronomy O
“pichi” O
(for O
using O
a O
description O
that O
you O
yourself O
use) O
of O
which O
the O
Bal O
is O
an O
exponent, O
it O
is O
populist, O
you O
badly O
finish. O

The O
formula O
without O
mentioning O
the O
coefficients O
or O
criteria O
to O
be O
valued O
serves O
me O
rather O
little, O
that O
by O
the O
way, O
I O
hope, O
you O
have O
had O
the O
decency O
to O
apply O
to O
the O
gastronomic O
result O
of O
the O
dishes O
a O
weight O
coefficient. O

And O
by O
the O
way, O
when O
something O
is O
done O
right, O
I O
will O
be O
the O
first O
to O
defend O
it, O
but O
God O
forbid O
I O
defend O
something O
simply O
because O
“it’s O
ours,” O
which O
I O
think O
is O
a O
weak O
favor O
to O
“ours.” O

I O
find O
myself, O
and O
how O
have O
you O
come O
to O
such O
conclusions?, O
because O
I O
do O
not O
use O
capital O
letters O
in O
a O
gentile?. O

JUAS O
I O
repeat, O
if O
you O
do O
not O
give O
the O
respective O
parameters O
to O
qualify O
(the O
Px O
that O
you O
say), O
and O
the O
weight O
of O
each O
one O
(Cx), O
the O
formula O
is O
neither O
explained O
nor O
serves O
any O
purpose. O

Come O
on, O
give O
them O
courage, O
and O
make O
them O
public O
to O
know O
how O
you O
get O
to O
value O
the O
restaurant O
with O
2/5 O
puppies, O
even O
though O
you O
value O
the O
cuisine O
in O
such O
a O
good O
way. O

Come O
on, O
it's O
not O
that O
hard, O
e.g. O

C1: O
Kitchen, O
P1: O
0.4C2: O
Situacon, O
P2: O
0.2C3: O
Service, O
P3: O
0.2C4: O
CPR, O
P4: O
0.1etc., O
etc. O

Or O
whatever O
you O
did, O
(e.g., O
ahem) O
Unless O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
teach O
your O
shames, O
and O
phobias... O

Congratulations!!, O
now O
you O
understand. O

Luis O
take O
advantage O
of O
dinner, O
and O
Jose, O
keep O
on O
your O
line O
that O
we O
love. O

I'm O
not O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant, O
I'm O
going O
to O
the O
safe O
and O
I'm O
going O
to O
stay O
for O
La O
Matilde... O

For O
Peter, O
you O
have O
to O
have O
your O
own O
judgment, O
value O
the O
recommendations O
in O
their O
rightful O
measure, O
such O
as O
what O
they O
are, O
personal O
impressions, O
and O
not O
be O
afraid O
to O
prove, O
and O
even O
let O
you O
down. O

It O
will O
not O
be O
the O
first O
time O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
a O
non-recommendation, O
and O
that O
on O
some O
occasions O
were O
of O
all O
confidence. O

But O
there O
each O
one O
with O
his O
acts O
of O
faith, O
blind O
or O
not. O

It's O
not O
for O
nothing, O
but O
look O
how O
you're O
hurting O
the O
alleged O
prescribers, O
with O
your O
alleged O
experience O
and O
your O
supposed O
good O
taste. O

Just O
by O
comparison O
of O
your O
writings, O
you O
spend O
forty-something O
euros O
on O
a O
lamborusco, O
a O
pizza, O
a O
little O
pasta O
and O
two O
balls O
of O
park O
ice O
cream O
and O
you O
put O
4 O
puppies O
on O
it. O

You O
eat O
some O
dishes O
that O
you O
won't O
make O
in O
your O
life O
and O
you O
put O
two. O

Please, O
if O
you're O
ashamed O
of O
yourself, O
stop O
writing O
silly O
words O
and O
hurting O
businesses O
mounted O
with O
all O
the O
dignity O
of O
the O
world O
and O
go O
home O
and O
make O
some O
macaroni O
of O
those O
that O
you O
seem O
to O
like O
so O
much. O

Friend O
José O
Aranda, O
if O
anything O
negative O
I O
have O
to O
comment O
on O
your O
criticisms, O
it O
is O
that O
you O
should. O

to O
take O
a O
little O
more O
care O
of O
spelling, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
gives O
some O
kicks O
to O
it, O
I O
hope O
by O
mistake O
“material” O
when O
writing O
and O
not O
by O
ignorance O
of O
language. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
main O
question O
is O
concerned, O
the O
criticisms O
themselves O
seem O
courageous O
to O
me, O
and O
moreover, O
most O
of O
the O
time, O
they O
coincide O
with O
my O
opinion, O
from O
what O
I O
gather O
that O
besides O
having O
the O
same O
tastes O
and O
criteria O
is O
you. O

a O
fair O
and O
honest O
person. O

Keep O
it O
that O
way, O
say O
what O
you O
think, O
don’t O
sell O
yourself O
to O
marketing O
or O
to O
the O
currents O
of O
opinion O
in O
vogue, O
many O
of O
us O
will O
thank O
you. O

A O
cordial O
greeting. O

P.S. O

I O
was O
also O
disappointed O
by O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
what O
is O
worse, O
served O
us O
a O
mere B-TARGET
near O
crude O
that O
had O
not O
been O
frozen O
previously, O
consciously O
failing O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
current O
rule O
in O
this O
regard O
(the O
owner B-TARGET
and O
cook B-TARGET
was O
especially O
“proud” O
not O
to O
freeze O
the O
fish). O

Too O
bad O
they O
don’t O
know O
how O
to O
differentiate O
between O
a O
cooked O
fish O
“at O
its O
point” O
and O
a O
directly O
raw O
fish, O
where O
the O
meat O
doesn’t O
come O
out O
of O
the O
spine O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
heat O
and O
cooking. O

And O
let O
it O
be O
noted O
that O
I O
love O
sushi O
and O
sashimi, O
but O
one O
thing O
is O
a O
specific O
preparation O
fulfilling O
the O
requirements O
to O
prevent O
the O
intake O
of O
live O
anisakis O
and O
another O
to O
take O
a O
wild O
fish B-TARGET
undercooked, O
with O
great O
probability O
of O
active O
parasites. O

Too O
bad O
things O
get O
confused, O
there O
is O
nothing O
worse O
than O
an O
ill-informed O
“enterate” O
as O
is O
the O
case O
with O
this O
cook. B-TARGET

Ana, O
Carlos, O
Pedro, O
Anselmo: O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
your O
support. O

Anselmo, O
I'm O
sorry O
for O
the O
spelling O
mistakes, O
they're O
the O
result O
of O
the O
rush, O
I O
don't O
have O
all O
the O
time O
I'd O
like, O
I'd O
appreciate O
it, O
you'll O
report O
any O
mistakes O
you O
found, O
thank O
you. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
agree O
with O
you O
in O
tastes, O
not O
so O
much O
that O
we O
both O
got O
disappointed O
out O
of O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
because O
I O
guess O
you, O
like O
me, O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
leave O
the O
Bal O
d’Onsera O
very O
happy, O
recommend O
it O
everywhere O
and O
not O
have O
the O
feeling O
of O
having O
lost O
time O
and O
money, O
at O
least O
me. O

It O
is O
not O
easy, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
to O
endure O
the O
gastronomic O
“interested O
ones”, O
the O
stretch O
Levites, O
moscons, O
scoundrels O
and O
cowards O
(because O
no O
one O
says O
their O
name O
surnames O
and O
“position” O
in O
this O
world O
when O
they O
insult) O
who O
write O
comments O
when O
an O
“intrusus”, O
like O
me, O
says O
what O
he O
thinks O
freely. O

There O
are O
many, O
many, O
the O
owners O
of O
restaurants O
who O
have O
confessed O
to O
me O
that O
they O
do O
not O
appear O
in O
specialized O
media O
if O
they O
do O
not O
buy O
advertising, O
if O
they O
do O
not O
invite O
the O
lists, O
etc.... O
some O
bend, O
what O
remedy, O
it O
is O
the O
bread O
of O
their O
children, O
others O
however O
aesthetically O
endure O
in O
their O
position O
and O
that O
less O
than O
the O
humble O
customers, O
like O
the O
one O
who O
writes, O
let O
us O
say O
publicly O
that O
they O
also O
have O
good O
tables. O

It O
rarely O
coincides O
with O
the O
opinion O
of O
oneself O
with O
that O
of O
other O
“food O
critics”, O
but O
I O
have O
rarely O
been O
able O
to O
agree O
more O
than O
with O
that O
of O
D. O
José O
Aranda:My O
wife O
and O
I O
went O
on O
May O
25 O
(Tuesday) O
to O
celebrate O
something O
special O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
disappointed. O

We O
thought O
about O
the O
reason O
for O
his O
star O
and O
it O
hurt O
our O
pocket. O

(almost O
the O
worst O
that O
can O
happen O
to O
you O
in O
a O
restaurant)I O
like O
to O
think O
about O
it O
after O
a O
while, O
when O
you O
have O
already O
assimilated O
the O
experience. O

I O
really O
don't O
remember O
any O
dishes B-TARGET
from O
the O
tasting O
menu O
that O
we O
take O
(symptomatic). O

I O
only O
remember O
a O
very O
dull O
and O
unfresh O
hake. B-TARGET
When O
you O
go O
to O
a O
place O
of O
these O
waiting O
everything O
and O
you O
may O
become O
less O
permissive O
than O
with O
others, O
but O
even O
with O
this O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
think O
we O
can O
all O
name O
at O
least O
half O
a O
dozen O
places O
in O
Zaragoza O
where O
we O
eat O
(as O
a O
global O
experience) O
better O
than O
here. O

I O
am O
very O
sorry O
for O
the O
opinion O
you O
have O
of O
this O
restaurant, O
as O
well O
as O
that O
of O
one O
of O
the O
readers O
of O
this O
website. O

I'm O
going O
to O
try O
to O
explain O
why O
your O
stardom, O
and O
how O
to O
understand O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant O
(which O
with O
all O
due O
respect O
is O
not O
possible O
for O
everyone O
because O
that's O
the O
way O
life O
is). O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
is O
that O
I've O
been O
4 O
or O
5 O
times, O
but O
given O
the O
onset O
of O
the O
crisis O
I O
haven't O
been O
going O
for O
two O
years, O
not O
because O
I O
don't O
want O
to, O
but O
because O
I O
can't. O

But O
having O
said O
this, O
let's O
start O
commenting O
point O
by O
point: O
-THE O
LOCAL: O
For O
colors O
tastes. O

I O
personally O
do O
not O
like O
the O
street O
or O
the O
area B-TARGET
of O
Zaragoza O
(it O
should O
be O
more O
central), O
but O
said O
this O
if O
I O
value O
and O
much O
the O
breadth O
of O
the O
round O
tables B-TARGET
(which O
I O
cannot O
explain O
from O
the O
economic O
point O
of O
view O
since O
if O
all O
the O
tables O
are O
occupied O
only O
by O
two O
diners O
it O
means O
a O
lower O
turnover). O

It O
is O
a O
joy O
and O
delight O
to O
have O
such O
a O
tablecloth O
table B-TARGET
for O
you O
and O
your O
companion. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
value O
that O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
entrepreneur O
towards O
his O
clients, O
which O
is O
surely O
valued O
by O
many O
people.... O

- O
SERVICE: O
you O
say O
that O
at O
no O
time O
did O
you O
empathize O
and O
that O
you O
like O
to O
be O
asked..."Well, O
look, O
I O
like O
not O
to O
be O
disturbed. O

Here O
are O
several O
types O
of O
clients, O
those O
who O
like O
to O
be O
kicked O
and O
those O
who O
don't. O

If O
you O
are O
one O
of O
the O
first O
(go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
of O
the O
Palafox O
hotel O
that O
has O
Jésús O
(the O
mustache) O
that O
makes O
it O
to O
perfection). O

I O
and O
many O
people O
like O
to O
eat O
well O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
evening, O
and O
we O
don't O
like O
to O
be O
interrupted O
by O
being O
interested O
if O
you O
like O
it, O
if O
it's O
all O
right, O
if O
you O
want O
something O
else, O
etc. O

If O
you O
have O
gone O
to O
many O
Michelin-starred O
restaurants O
you O
will O
see O
that O
the O
only O
time O
that O
bothers O
you O
is O
when O
you O
are O
enunciated O
the O
dishes O
at O
the O
time O
of O
serving O
them.Of O
course O
if O
you O
ask O
them O
and O
you O
give O
them O
a O
foot O
then O
they O
answer O
you.But O
what O
we O
are O
going O
to O
do O
is O
for O
the O
diners O
to O
enjoy O
their O
evening, O
both O
for O
the O
atmosphere O
and O
for O
the O
food. O

And O
the O
service? O

This O
has O
to O
be O
always O
exquisite O
and O
go O
unnoticed. O

If O
so, O
then O
it's O
been O
perfect. O

For O
me O
the O
SERVICE B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
I O
value O
him O
as O
one O
of O
the O
best O
because O
they O
don't O
bother. O

As O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
don't O
understand O
him O
speaking, O
excuse O
me O
for O
not O
even O
answering O
because O
I O
don't O
believe O
it. O

Every O
time O
I O
went O
there O
was O
a O
girl O
with O
short O
black O
hair O
(Spanish) O
and O
the O
cook's O
wife O
(Carmen). O

Both O
are O
very O
discreet O
as O
required O
in O
this O
type O
of O
establishment. O

Unfortunately, O
I O
do O
not O
consider O
myself O
an O
expert, O
but O
given O
the O
small O
size O
of O
the O
premises, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
to O
be O
a O
very O
successful O
letter. O

I O
am O
also O
surprised O
by O
the O
promotion O
of O
the O
best O
wines B-TARGET
in O
our O
region, O
which O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
bet O
on O
them O
as O
much O
as O
this O
restaurant.Prices? O

Let O
me O
tell O
you O
that O
you O
can't O
be O
worth O
the O
same O
wine O
in O
this O
establishment O
as O
anyone O
else. O

Obviously. O

CHARTER: O
At O
this O
point O
I O
agree O
on O
your O
success O
in O
ordering O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

This O
is O
where O
the O
cook O
can O
surprise O
and O
delight O
us O
with O
his O
know-how.I O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
the O
first O
time O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

I O
experienced O
different O
sensations O
and O
it O
was O
a O
culinary O
pleasure O
I O
had O
rarely O
experienced. O

Then O
he O
didn't O
have O
the O
Michelin O
Star O
but O
he O
could O
already O
sense O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
fall.The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
imaginative, O
modern, O
sophisticated, O
etc.What O
was O
left O
hungry? O

Well, O
I O
don't O
believe O
it. O

That O
someone O
else O
says O
I O
can O
believe O
it O
but O
someone O
like O
you?Look, O
I O
know O
people O
who O
go O
to O
Arzak O
and O
say O
the O
same O
thing. O

And O
Can O
Roca's O
the O
same. O
What O
do O
I O
tell O
them? O

Majo, O
go O
to O
the O
bravo O
squid O
and O
ask O
for O
two O
sandwiches. O

You've O
got O
yourself O
a O
little O
confused. O

If O
you O
don't O
like O
it, O
you O
have O
the O
WOK O
that's O
a O
self-service O
until O
you O
can't O
do O
it O
anymore. O

But O
that's O
why O
it O
doesn't O
have O
three O
stars O
and O
it O
only O
has O
one O
star. O

What O
I O
totally O
agree O
with O
you O
is O
the O
pairing O
of O
wines. O

How O
are O
we O
going O
to O
order O
a O
wine O
if O
we O
are O
not O
fortune O
tellers O
of O
the O
dishes O
that O
are O
going O
to O
take O
us O
out?At O
this O
point O
they O
fail. O

And O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
price, O
it O
is O
what O
it O
is. O

For O
me O
prohibitive O
these O
days, O
but O
in O
spite O
of O
everything O
I O
don't O
think O
they O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
because O
there O
are O
only O
five O
tables. O

One O
last O
comment O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
cook B-TARGET
is O
that O
last O
year O
he O
was O
invited O
at O
the O
Expo O
in O
China O
(he O
went O
out O
in O
press), O
and O
the O
dishes O
he O
presented O
in O
the O
Spanish O
week O
were O
typical O
Aragonese O
(borraja, O
ternasco... O
and O
all O
with O
Aragonese O
wines).With O
this O
all O
I O
want O
to O
indicate O
is O
my O
surprise O
at O
the O
propaganda O
of O
Aragonese O
food, O
which O
I O
am O
glad O
that O
someone O
defends O
it O
(and O
a O
Spanish O
Aragonese O
says O
so). O

Greetings O
and O
congratulations O
on O
your O
website. O

Gonzalo O

For O
Gonzalo, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
answer O
briefly: O
I O
don’t O
like O
being O
kicked, O
the O
staff O
of O
the O
room O
doesn’t O
like O
to O
do O
it O
either, O
but O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
recognize O
that O
it O
enters O
into O
their O
“work” O
because O
there O
is O
someone O
who O
likes O
it, O
but O
it’s O
different O
to O
jerking O
off O
than O
to O
be O
interested O
in O
the O
well-being O
of O
the O
diners, O
especially O
when O
they O
take O
a O
small O
dish O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen, O
a O
“didn’t O
you O
like O
it?” O
“Is O
everything O
okay?” O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
collecting O
the O
dishes O
doesn’t O
bother, O
it’s O
not O
punting, O
it’s O
education. O

He O
says O
he O
doesn't O
believe O
me O
when O
I O
say O
that O
I O
didn't O
understand O
the O
person O
who O
brought O
the O
dishes O
to O
me O
when O
I O
introduced O
them, O
because O
I O
can O
assure O
him O
that O
the O
girl B-TARGET
didn't O
speak O
Spanish O
or O
half O
way, O
what O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
say?If O
you O
want O
to O
ask O
in O
the O
restaurant O
the O
staff O
they O
had O
for O
those O
dates, O
it's O
something O
so O
simple O
to O
validate O
that O
it O
deserves O
no O
more O
words. O

I O
don’t O
think O
I O
was O
hungry O
either, O
because O
yes, O
I O
stayed O
hungry, O
and O
I O
like O
it O
when O
I’m O
going O
to O
eat O
in O
a O
restaurant, O
regardless O
of O
the O
level O
and O
price, O
to O
get O
eaten, O
but O
I O
wouldn’t O
call O
it O
going O
to O
eat... O
we O
could O
say O
are O
we O
going O
to O
a O
cooking O
show O
at O
the O
Bal O
d’ O
Onsera O
restaurant O
where O
even, O
for O
80 O
euros O
per O
person, O
allow O
us O
to O
try O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
each O
creation?, B-TARGET
but O
that’s O
right, O
then O
to O
eat O
we O
go O
home. O

Finally O
I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
you O
for O
including O
your O
first O
and O
last O
name, O
as O
I O
do, O
giving O
your O
face, O
it O
is O
very O
good O
to O
have O
different O
points O
of O
view, O
this O
enriches, O
I O
give O
my O
opinion O
and O
you O
yours. O

Unfortunately, O
it O
is O
customary O
for O
people O
on O
the O
Internet O
to O
hide O
and O
demonstrate O
their O
cowardice, O
not O
their O
case, O
thanks O
for O
their O
frankness. O

Good O
morning, O
I O
am B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
regular I-TARGET
customer I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
this I-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
convinced I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
this I-TARGET
type I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

Honestly, O
I O
find O
some O
negative O
comments O
about O
this O
restaurant O
mind-blowing. O

Despite O
them, O
Bal O
D’Onsera O
continues O
to O
maintain O
its O
Michelin O
star O
(4th O
consecutive O
year O
as O
UNICO O
in O
Zaragoza) O
and O
this O
year O
it O
has O
1 O
Repsol O
sun; O
which O
distinguishes O
it O
as O
UNICO O
retsaurant O
in O
Aragon O
with O
double O
recognition O
by O
the O
2 O
guides O
referent O
of O
gastronomy. O

I O
agree O
with O
Gonzalo O
that O
he O
has O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go, O
until O
the O
2nd O
and O
3rd O
stars O
and O
suns. O

But O
I O
also O
believe O
that O
this O
recognition O
should O
make O
those O
critical O
voices O
or O
comments O
reflect, O
which O
can O
also O
be O
mistaken.Zaragozana O

We O
were O
last O
day O
2-3-12 O
eating O
(celebrating O
our O
wedding O
anniversary) O
and O
I O
waited O
a O
few O
days, O
to O
make O
the O
criticism, O
to O
pass O
the O
anger.We O
acquired, O
on O
a O
website O
of O
discounts, O
two O
bonuses O
to O
eat O
in O
this O
establishment, O
a O
Michelin O
star, O
magnificent! O

(thought) O
The O
result O
could O
not O
be O
more O
disappointing. O

To O
start O
the O
door B-TARGET
looks O
like O
the O
one O
in O
the O
warehouse, O
you O
call O
the O
doorman O
and O
they O
open O
you O
(although O
this O
you O
will O
tell O
me O
is O
secondary). O

Once O
inside O
the O
decoration O
is O
how O
my O
wife O
would O
like O
it O
to O
be O
that O
of O
our O
house: O
minimalist. O
Of O
the O
furniture B-TARGET
just O
say O
a O
couple O
of O
things: O
uncomfortable O
chairs O
and O
tables O
the O
size O
of O
“La O
Misericordia”, O
if O
we O
do O
not O
bring O
the O
chairs O
between O
if O
it O
seems O
that O
I O
am O
eating O
angry O
with O
my O
wife. O

To O
finish O
with O
the O
previous O
ones O
before O
entering O
with O
the O
meal O
a O
comment: O
a O
little O
music O
of O
atmosphere O
daria O
intimacy, O
everything O
was O
heard O
that O
was O
said O
in O
the O
other O
5 O
tables O
that O
were O
occupied O
(all O
of O
them O
with O
couples O
with O
coupons O
like O
us). O

Let's O
start O
with O
the O
menu: O

- O
Carpaccio B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
bonito I-TARGET
: O
It O
would O
be O
nice, O
I O
do O
not O
discuss O
it, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
know O
to O
anything, O
totally O
insipid, O
also O
had O
beets, B-TARGET
just O
as O
insipid, O
and O
an O
ice O
cream O
of, O
I O
think O
remember O
that O
mango, O
that O
if O
it O
had O
any O
flavor. O

- O
Scallops B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
prawns I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
winter I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
: O
If O
you O
observe O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
dish O
is O
in O
singular O
scallops O
and O
prawns O
and O
the O
reason O
is O
no O
other O
that O
there O
was O
one O
of O
each, O
in O
this O
case O
the O
flavors, O
impossible O
to O
eliminate, O
were O
correct, O
the O
scallops O
would O
be, O
but O
neither O
knew O
nor O
saw O
me. O

Cod B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
pil I-TARGET
aerated I-TARGET
: O
No O
objections O
(that's O
the O
best O
I O
can O
say). O

Risotto B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
: O
The O
foie O
has O
little O
mystery O
a O
pan O
and O
nothing O
more, O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
spoil O
it, O
now O
well O
the O
risotto O
ran O
worse O
luck, O
it O
was O
risotto, O
of O
that O
I O
am O
sure, O
because O
I O
saw O
it, O
grains O
of O
rice O
and O
others O
but O
flavor, O
that O
if O
very O
intense, O
to O
cream O
and O
only O
to O
cream. O

- O
Glazed B-TARGET
calf I-TARGET
carrillera I-TARGET
: O
Soft O
as O
butter O
but O
knew O
nothing O
at O
all, O
totally O
insulse. O

- O
Limon, B-TARGET
mango I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
muscatel, I-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
: O
The O
dessert O
was O
good O
(without O
more).We O
finished O
the O
meal O
with O
a O
gin O
tonic O
with O
gourmet O
preparation O
(ponia O
in O
the O
discount O
quota): O
The O
combined O
prepared O
salt O
of O
the O
kitchen. O

I'm O
sorry O
to O
be O
the O
one O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
combos O
are O
prepared O
at O
the O
table, O
the O
glass O
comes O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
(or O
whatever, O
in O
this O
case O
glass) O
with O
the O
ice O
and O
the O
slice O
of O
lemon, O
lime O
or O
whatever O
and O
the O
gin O
is O
served O
in O
front O
of O
the O
customer O
like O
the O
tonica, O
it's O
not O
by O
suspicion O
is O
by O
usual O
practice O
(it O
doesn't O
happen O
to O
me O
to O
doubt O
the O
ingredients O
but O
it O
doesn't O
look O
good). O

Now O
it's O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
service: B-TARGET
right O
in O
the O
deal O
but O
slow O
is O
little, O
between O
plate O
and O
plate O
a O
few O
unacceptable O
waiting O
times.I O
have O
left O
for O
the O
end O
a O
small O
detail, O
for O
some O
of O
them O
of O
no O
importance, O
and O
it O
is O
the O
size O
of O
the O
rations B-TARGET
: O
It O
can O
be O
put O
less O
on O
each O
of O
the O
dishes O
but O
that O
is O
very O
very O
difficult O
(less O
that O
we O
had O
taken O
the O
appetizer O
in O
Palomeque O
where O
the O
rations O
are O
generous)With O
all O
this O
my O
opinion O
I O
think O
it O
is O
clear O
and O
I O
will O
add O
only O
one O
more O
thing: O
I O
come O
out O
feeling O
cheated O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
I O
bought O
two O
bonuses O
in O
Groupalia, O
for O
the O
Restaurant O
of O
a O
Michelin O
Star, O
the O
Bal O
d O
́Onsera, O
at O
49€/person, O
so O
I O
spent O
98€ O
to O
take O
my O
companion O
to O
dinner, O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occasion. O

It O
looked O
like O
a O
bet O
on O
insurance, O
“only O
Zaragoza O
restaurant O
with O
Michelin O
Star”!! O

A O
prior O
appointment O
was O
essential, O
so O
I O
advised O
with O
two O
weeks O
of O
time, O
choosing O
a O
Tuesday O
night. O

This O
was O
the O
menu O
that O
appeared O
on O
the O
coupon, O
the O
truth O
that O
looked O
very O
good... O

Well, O
for O
starters, O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
and O
we O
were O
the O
first, O
the O
whole O
dining O
room O
for O
ourselves! O

As O
we O
sit O
at O
the O
table, O
we O
are O
already O
told O
that O
the O
beef B-TARGET
loaf I-TARGET
was O
over O
(beginning O
of O
the O
week, O
first O
to O
come O
to O
dinner, O
with O
a O
closed O
menu O
and O
warning O
with O
two O
weeks O
of O
time....), O
that O
they O
would O
give O
us O
beef O
chop... O
first O
chasco, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
not O
comparable O
(and O
certainly, O
it O
was O
not, O
it O
required O
chewing O
it O
very O
long). O

After O
warning O
us O
about O
the O
change, O
he O
asks O
us O
if O
a O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
seemed O
good O
to O
begin O
with, O
so, O
before O
that O
question, O
I O
told O
him O
if O
they O
would O
not O
serve O
the O
three O
wines O
that O
appeared O
in O
the O
coupon, O
to O
which O
he O
told O
us O
that O
one O
of O
the O
wineries, O
did O
not O
supply O
them O
until O
November...something O
that O
to O
me O
personally, O
seems O
great... O
but O
they O
were O
not O
going O
to O
serve O
it O
to O
us!!!, O
since O
they O
had O
considered O
enough O
two O
wines, O
one O
white O
and O
one O
red.. O
I O
think O
that O
when O
you O
have O
paid O
for O
a O
closed O
menu, O
they O
should O
adjust O
to O
what O
you O
have O
bought, O
since O
if O
not, O
it O
is O
a O
scam, O
and O
then O
they O
see O
that O
they O
have O
not O
enough O
margin, O
when O
they O
take O
out O
another O
bonus, O
that O
they O
adjust O
the O
menu O
to O
what O
they O
think, O
so O
the O
consumer O
can O
choose O
before O
buying.Well, O
we O
do O
not O
finish O
everything O
there, O
we O
ask O
him O
for O
the O
cava B-TARGET
and O
he O
tells O
us, O
that O
they O
also O
did O
not O
serve O
it, O
that O
they O
believed O
that O
the O
menu O
is O
well O
this O
way!!! O

To O
hallucinate! O

Sure, O
once O
you've O
already O
paid! O

Of O
course, O
as O
it O
was O
a O
special O
moment, O
I O
didn't O
want O
to O
set O
up O
a O
circus, O
nor O
ask O
for O
the O
complaint O
book, O
but O
the O
feeling O
with O
which O
I O
left O
that O
restaurant B-TARGET
wasn't O
good, O
I O
felt O
cheated.Finally, O
that O
I O
didn't O
advise O
at O
all, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
excessively O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
really O
is, O
and O
of O
course, O
I O
don't O
encourage O
anyone O
to O
buy O
coupons O
to O
eat O
there, O
since O
they O
risk O
being O
served O
what O
they O
consider O
at O
that O
time, O
regardless O
of O
what O
you O
paid O
for O
earlier. O

I O
was O
yesterday O
February O
22 O
at O
the O
restaurant O
bal O
d’osera O
and O
my O
surprise O
was O
that O
first O
they O
apologize O
because O
they O
still O
don’t O
have O
racks, B-TARGET
then O
the O
tables B-TARGET
also O
tell O
you O
that O
they O
are O
provisional O
(they O
wouldn’t O
have O
opened O
even O
if O
they O
couldn’t) O
because O
the O
price O
certainly O
hasn’t O
lowered O
it. O

For O
me O
with O
this O
reform O
to O
lost O
charm, O
because O
you O
are O
dining O
without O
privacy, O
seeing O
and O
hearing O
the O
people O
that O
are O
in O
the O
bar. O

With O
which O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
you O
have O
to O
raise O
your O
voice O
more O
to O
hear O
you O
and O
form O
an O
environment B-TARGET
that O
does O
not O
what O
is O
expected O
of O
a O
Michelin O
star. O

I O
was O
on O
day O
6-12-08 O
and O
the O
truth O
very O
well; O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
fasion O
the O
walls O
torally O
white, O
the O
chairs O
very O
modern O
but O
comfortable O
and O
without O
any O
picture. O

We O
asked O
the O
à O
carte O
and O
appetizer B-TARGET
we O
got O
a O
spoon O
of O
cod O
brandy O
with O
a O
shot O
of O
burning O
broth O
and O
almond O
foam, O
the O
truth O
was O
very O
delicate. O

At O
first O
we O
caught O
a O
risote B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
and O
a O
super O
medallon B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fresh I-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
passed I-TARGET
by I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
iron O
and O
a O
few O
erasers O
with O
centollo O
were O
the O
two O
very O
good O
things O
and O
cooked O
to O
the O
dente. O
second O
the O
hake B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
julliana I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
sepia I-TARGET
and O
a O
lollipop B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ternasco I-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
saffron, O
the O
hazelnut O
was O
little O
made O
from O
inside O
but O
hot O
and O
the O
little O
made O
sirloin O
also O
and O
with O
very O
little O
sauce; O
and O
d O
epostre O
a O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
chocolates I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
textures I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
reduced I-TARGET
orange I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
and O
a O
merenge O
with O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
; O
very O
good O
everything, O
two O
coffees O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
water O
for O
123 O
euros. O

This O
reservation O
was O
a O
success. O

The O
quality O
price O
ratio O
is O
very O
good. O

Excellent O
service. B-TARGET

Big O
rations. B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
attentive O
and O
very O
friendly, O
the O
menu O
calçotada B-TARGET
is O
endless! O

Best O
of O
all, O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
artichokes I-TARGET
(they O
were O
luxurious) O
and O
the O
limes B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tiles, I-TARGET
great! O

The O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
too. O

They O
had O
a O
detail O
when O
I O
switched O
the O
meat O
barbecue O
for O
a O
vegetable O
barbecue O
(vegetarian O
option). O

I'll O
repeat O
for O
sure! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
quite O
good O
(quality O
and O
quantity), O
although O
it O
took O
a O
while O
to O
be O
served O
(it O
was O
true O
that O
it O
was O
full, O
the O
place, O
but... O
you O
have O
to O
foresee O
it O
having O
more O
staff O
or O
taking O
less O
services). O

The O
place, B-TARGET
more O
pleasant O
than O
it O
seemed, O
although O
with O
the O
music O
excessively O
high O
(difficult O
to O
talk, O
by O
the O
volume O
of O
the O
music O
and O
the O
number O
of O
diners). O

Something O
expensive O
for O
the O
whole O
restaurant. B-TARGET

But O
right, O
worthy, O
good. O

Great O
interior, B-TARGET
quality O
food. B-TARGET

Careful O
and O
quick O
service. B-TARGET

VERY O
RECOMMENDABLE O

Calçotada B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
as O
for O
the O
meat B-TARGET
it O
was O
somewhat O
scarce O
or O
improveable O
in O
quality O
without O
altering O
the O
number O
of O
pieces. O

Great, O
great O
place, B-TARGET
great O
attention. B-TARGET

The O
magnificent O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu O

Food B-TARGET
- O
6.5 O
(the O
main O
dish, O
the O
calsots, B-TARGET
cost O
to O
peel O
because O
the O
root O
was O
not O
cut O
and O
its O
quality O
was O
not O
very O
good. O

The O
romesco B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
and O
butifarra B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
good. O

We O
also O
liked O
dessert). B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
- O
4 O
(We O
feel O
a O
little O
invisible O
by O
the O
staff, O
they O
simply O
dedicated O
themselves O
to O
serving O
the O
food. O

"all O
right? O

", O
"you O
liked O
it?"... O

are O
typical O
questions O
I O
found O
missing O
for O
an O
attention. B-TARGET

They O
gave O
us O
the O
option O
to O
repeat O
calsots, B-TARGET
it O
is O
always O
a O
detail O
that O
is O
appreciated O
but O
not O
enough O
to O
approve O
the O
service. O
) O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
- O
9 O
(good O
for O
eating O
a O
paired O
and O
quiet, O
which O
was O
the O
case) O

quality-price O
- O
7 O
(the O
calsot B-TARGET
product O
can O
be O
improved, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
very O
correct O
and O
dessert B-TARGET
also O
). O

I O
approve O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
if O
you O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
calsot B-TARGET
it O
is O
recommended O
100% O
to O
make O
a O
calsotada O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona. O

We O
dine O
very O
well...quality O
reasonable O
price. O

The O
excellent O
service... B-TARGET
although O
we O
didn't O
like O
how O
the O
room B-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
pressed O
the O
waiters... O
they O
don't O
deserve O
that O
deal... O
and O
less O
in O
front O
of O
the O
customers. O

In O
general O
we O
are O
satisfied.. O
no O
doubt.. O
we O
will O
return O

At O
first O
they O
seemed O
a O
bit O
abrupt O
and O
having O
booked O
they O
were O
going O
to O
give O
us O
the O
worst O
table O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

But O
we O
ask O
that O
they O
change O
us O
and O
from O
there O
everything O
phenomenal. O

Good O
attention B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
although O
we O
had O
to O
order O
several O
times O
the O
same O
for O
lack O
of O
coordination O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
well O
in O
general. O

Very O
good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
very O
nice O
and O
nice. O

The O
calçots B-TARGET
are O
good. O

Excellent. O

Adequate O
price O
and O
quality. O

Fast O
and O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

The O
very O
cozy O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

We O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
because O
even O
if O
it O
was O
full O
the O
attention B-TARGET
was O
unbeatable O
and O
fast. O

I O
also O
value O
its O
location, B-TARGET
for O
which O
we O
don't O
have O
a O
car O
you O
get O
very O
easily O
as O
it O
is O
very O
central. O

Congratulations! O

A O
modern O
restaurant O
where O
food B-TARGET
is O
on O
your O
own O
and O
the O
deal B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly. O

The O
best O
decision, O
eat O
over O
there! O

Right. O

We O
ate O
very O
well O
the O
whole O
family, O
the O
spectacular O
entrecot. B-TARGET

The O
presentation O
of O
all O
the O
dishes O
very O
good. O

A O
very O

The O

We O
were O
a O

I'd O

Well, O
quality O

We O
had O
calçots O
with O
my O
foreign O
friends, O
at O
night O
and O
in O
Barcelona... O
it O
didn't O
seem O
like O
the O
best O
way O
to O
introduce O
this O
typical O
event O
to O
my O
friends, O
but O
in O
Balmes/Rosello O
we O
ate O
a O
calçotada B-TARGET
worthy O
of O
the O
best O
mass. O

great O
service, B-TARGET
real O
embers, B-TARGET
with O
artichokes B-TARGET
and O
grilled. B-TARGET

The O
romesco B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
incredible O
and O
not O
with O
too O
much O
garlic O
that O
repeats O
you O
all O
night O
as O
in O
some O
places! O

Super O
recommended!! O

Abundant O
food, B-TARGET
good O
value O
for O
money O
if O
you O
order O
incoming O
+ O
second O
you O
can O
dine O
for O
about O
12 O
euros O

We O
went O
3 O
friends O
to O
eat O
a O
calçotada O
and O
everyone O
told O
us O
that O
the O
calçotadas O
in O
the O
city O
were O
not O
good, O
that O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
outskirts, O
however O
we B-TARGET
charmed, I-TARGET
everything O
very O
good, O
the O
great O
deal, B-TARGET
taught O
us O
to O
eat O
the O
calçots, O
and O
very O
well O
priced, O
I O
recommend O
it O
without O
a O
doubt. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
decent, O
the O
bravas B-TARGET
not O
spicy O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
poor O
in O
attention. O

The O
Rte O
Balmes- O
Rosello O
charms O
us O
by O
its O
service, B-TARGET
location, B-TARGET
toilet O
and O
comfort. O

All O
exterior O
and O
bright O
with O
easy O
accesses. O

Congratulate O
from O
aqii O
to O
the O
address. O

Price-quality: O
excellent. O

Repeat O

All O
very O
correct: O
value O
for O
money, O
the O
ease O
to O
combine O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu O
with O
menu, O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
very O
well. O

The O
youngest O
diner O
on O
the O
table O
(20 O
years O
old) O
said O
he O
would O
return O
on O
his O
own. O

Calçotada B-TARGET
menu O
recommended O
for O
its O
value O
for O
money. O

If O
you O
keep O
it, O
next O
year O
we'll O
repeat! O

I O
went O
with O
some O
Mexican O
friends O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
rare O
to O
do O
a O
calçotada O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona, O
but O
the O
experience O
was O
excellent, O
they O
offered O
us O
more O
once O
finished. O

Really O
exquisite O
food B-TARGET
and O
all O
very O
well. O

Highly O
recommended. O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
a O
calçotada B-TARGET
and O
there O
was O
no O
complaint. O

Very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
a O
very O
well O
decorated O
place B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

The O
deal B-TARGET
was O
great O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
whole O
team, O
but O
we O
were O
generally O
lucky O
that O
Mr.Joseph O
put O
part O
of O
his O
collaboration O
in O
the O
chosen O
menu. O

We'll O
be O
right O
back. O

It O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
and O
the O
price O
went O
well O

Restaurant O
for O
not O
throwing O
rockets O
but O
generally O
you O
get O
satisfied. O

Very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
fast O
service B-TARGET

We O
ate O
two O
very O
good O
calçotades B-TARGET
menus! O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
very O
nice O
and O
constantly O
looking O
forward O
that O
we O
would O
not O
miss O
anything! O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
seemed O
strange O
to O
me O
is O
that O
they O
didn't O
have O
Catalan O
cream O
for O
dessert! B-TARGET

:( O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
I O
totally O
recommend O
it! O

I O
hadn't O
had O
an O
experience O
in O
which O
nothing O
had O
failed O
in O
a O
while, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
case. O

I O
went O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
my O
in-laws O
and O
they O
were O
all O
delighted: O
service, B-TARGET
speed, B-TARGET
cooking B-TARGET
points, I-TARGET
rations, B-TARGET
quality/price, O
Only O
two O
buts: O
the O
wine B-TARGET
of O
the O
house O
had O
a O
point O
of O
randomness O
and O
they O
could O
have O
put O
us O
at O
a O
more O
central O
point O
in O
the O
living O
room. O

Totally O
recommended O
for O
a O
relaxed O
meal, O
with O
an O
aroma O
of O
ember. O

A O
wide O
menu, O
rich O
food B-TARGET
and O
with O
good O
quality O
price, O
correct O
service B-TARGET
and O
attentive O
and O
very O
lively O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
it O
for O
any O
occasion... O

I O
was O
really O
surprised O
because O
I O
had O
never O
been O
there, O
we O
were O
a O
group O
of O
20 O
people O
and O
it O
was O
great, O
very O
cozy O
place, B-TARGET
modern O
decoration, B-TARGET
good O
quality O
food... B-TARGET
and O
an O
economic O
price O
to O
be O
Barcelona. O

Totally O
recommended. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
too! O

Very O
attentive. O

Good O
service. B-TARGET

Good O
quality O
price O

Watchful O
waiters, B-TARGET
plenty O
of O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Great O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

Great! O

Lots O
of O
food! B-TARGET

Excellent O
quality/price O
ratio, O
very O
complete O
rations B-TARGET
and O
very O
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

The O
perfect O
service. B-TARGET

Calçotada O
menu O
very O
well, O
let O
repeat, O
good O
quality-price-quality O
ratio. O

Perfect O
price-quality. O

It's O
all O
very O
correct. O

We O
ordered O
the O
calçotada O
menu, O
and O
the O
calçots B-TARGET
left O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired. O

They O
were O
very O
small O
in O
size O
and O
some O
empty... O

We've O
tried O
them O
infinitely O
better O
in O
other O
restaurants... O

That's O
not O
why O
I'm O
coming O
back. O

The O
barbecue's B-TARGET
a O
little O
short... O

We O
went O
2 O
people O
to O
take O
the O
menu O
of O
calçotada O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
too. O

We O
like O
it. O

We O
ate O
very O
well. O

Quality O
and O
quantity. O

We O
were O
three O
adults. O

Reserve O
calçotada. O

When O
they O
arrived, O
they O
changed O
us O
to O
a O
table O
better O
than O
the O
one O
they O
had O
initially O
reserved O
to O
make O
us O
calmer. O

Very O
good O
deal B-TARGET
and O
they O
put O
us O
extra O
calçots O
without O
charging O
it. O

Very O
good O
memory. O

Perfect. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
visit O
this O
place, O
promoted O
by O
the O
web. O

In O
view O
of O
the O
promotion, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
slightly O
misleading, O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
price O
of O
the O
letter, O
since O
it O
exceeds O
the O
average O
of O
20-30 O
euros O
as O
announced, O
without O
making O
any O
excess. O

3 O
people, O
4 O
servings O
of O
entrees O
and O
2 O
seconds, O
along O
with O
a O
dessert O
and O
2 O
coffees, O
drinks, O
water O
for O
two O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
wine, O
the O
total, O
exceeds O
30 O
per O
person. O

We O
really O
liked O
the O
place, B-TARGET
very O
biuen O
ambient, B-TARGET
quiet, O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

We'll O
be O
right O
back! O

Very O
nice, O
good O
value O
for O
money O
and O
good O
cuisine. B-TARGET

We'll O
repeat O
for O
sure. O

Good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
food, B-TARGET
a O
recommended O
place. B-TARGET

The O
truth O
is O
that O
everything O
was O
very O
good, O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
and O
everything O
as O
expected. O

For O
putting O
some O
glue, O
the O
calçots B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
not O
purely O
romesco, O
but O
it O
was O
fine. O

We'll O
probably O
repeat. O

Good O
food, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
excellent O
customer O
service. B-TARGET

We O
went O
for O
the O
calçota O
and O
everything O
great O
but O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
let O
us O
down O
pretty O
wise O
to O
tomato. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
is O
already O
served O
and O
it O
does O
not O
convince O
us, O
some O
had O
too O
much O
tomato O
and O
personally O
I O
like O
to O
make O
it O
with O
a O
little O
garlic O
spread. O

Fear O
it O
all O
very O
well, O
the O
price O
very O
correct. O

Very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
we O
were O
happy O
with O
the O
calçotada. B-TARGET

Very O
attentive O
living O
room O
staff B-TARGET
and O
quality O
and O
well-cooked O
food. B-TARGET

Nice O
place B-TARGET
even O
though O
it O
lacks O
a O
"something" O

My O
partner O
and O
I O
have O
gone O
there O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
having O
dinner O
and O
in O
the O
end O
we O
have O
only O
taken O
two O
servings. O

Service B-TARGET
lacks O
a O
lot O
of O
education. O

We've O
asked O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
steamed B-TARGET
mussels I-TARGET
that O
were O
uncleaned O
and O
a O
portion B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
prawns I-TARGET
in O
which O
we O
haven't O
even O
been O
covered. O

The O
shrimps B-TARGET
were O
good O
but O
expensive. O

We O
will O
not B-TARGET
return, I-TARGET
we O
will O
stay O
with O
“La O
Casa O
de O
Mar”. O

I've O
been O
several O
times, O
the O
professional O
and O
very O
friendly O
treatment, B-TARGET
as O
far O
as O
the O
product B-TARGET
is O
concerned, O
very O
well O
in O
quality O
and O
quantity, O
no O
surprises O

It's O
a O
right O
place, B-TARGET
just O
like O
that. O

where O
this O
price B-TARGET
is O
stable O
and O
you O
don't O
scare O
yourself.. O

On O
Saturday, O
June O
15th, O
we O
were O
in O
this O
restaurant O
for O
dinner O
remembering O
good O
and O
bad O
days O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
mangrove. O

Correct O
treatment, O
food B-TARGET
unfortunately O
bad O
from O
a O
raw O
gratin O
balalao B-TARGET
to O
a O
warmed O
beef O
cheek B-TARGET
in O
microwave O
and O
that O
goes O
from O
heating O
to O
dry O
in O
the O
thinner O
parts. O

Until O
you've O
never O
been O
friends, O
you'll O
need O
luck. O

I O
was O
there O
for O
the O
week O
and O
chose O
a O
daily O
executive O
menu. O

First B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
simplen O
style O
barracks. O

The O
second O
sauerkraut B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
that O
only O
contained O
the O
head. O

Return O
to O
kitchen, O
waitress's B-TARGET
kindness, O
billing O
and O
goodbye. O

I O
hope O
with O
the O
letter O
your O
work O
will O
be O
more O
satisfying. O

Bad B-TARGET
taste I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
mouth I-TARGET
after I-TARGET
having I-TARGET
read I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
criticisms I-TARGET
above I-TARGET
all I-TARGET
for I-TARGET
going I-TARGET
out O
without O
eating. O

There O
are O
many O
menus O
of O
the O
day O
in O
Zaragoza O
that O
have O
no O
comparison O
with O
this O
one. O

Of O
course O
a O
disaster. O

not O
to O
come O
back. O

I O
couldn't O
comment, O
but O
the O
truth O
was O
very O
good O
place, B-TARGET
with O
blunt O
dishes. B-TARGET

They O
served O
us O
an O
aperitif, O
toast O
with O
tomato. O

At O
first O
we O
had O
a O
pink B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
good O
to O
share, O
to O
eat O
then O
a O
guindillas O
(some O
itchy) O
and O
then O
eggs O
with O
foie. O

And O
on O
the O
main O
course O
we O
ate O
cod O
with O
ali-oli, O
which O
I O
couldn't O
finish, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
full. O

And O
dessert O
was O
a O
sorbet, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
full. O

To O
come O
back, O
no O
doubt. O

Hey. O

I O
was O
at O
the O
restaurant O
on O
12-9-2009. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
not O
one O
of O
those O
who O
dazzles O
with O
its O
luxury O
decoration O
but O
has O
that O
sobriety O
of O
places O
they O
know O
they O
don't O
need. O

The O
possibilities O
in O
the O
restaurant O
are O
basically O
three; O
regular O
menu, O
tasting O
menu O
and O
an O
intermediate O
option O
that O
is O
a O
selection O
of O
first O
and O
desserts O
and O
menu O
for O
the O
second. O

This O
was O
our O
choice.Apart O
from O
the O
food O
ordered O
the O
house O
invites O
to O
three O
small O
appetizers O
in O
which O
I O
like O
about O
way O
the O
anchovies B-TARGET
pate. I-TARGET
The O
first O
choice O
of O
the O
chef O
were O
an O
octopus O
carp-chio, O
a O
cake O
of O
mushrooms O
pecs, O
some O
prawns O
and O
a O
canelos O
of O
pickled O
partridge. O

In O
general O
at O
a O
great O
level O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
individual O
so O
no O
matter O
how O
many O
people O
on O
the O
table O
the O
starters O
will O
be O
the O
same. O

The O
seconds O
on O
the O
table O
were O
a O
sirloin, O
an O
Iberian O
prey, O
a O
tinsel O
of O
ternasco O
and O
a O
rappe. O

Both O
the O
lollipops B-TARGET
(rather O
than O
generous O
the O
piece O
) O
and O
the O
prey, O
which O
are O
the O
only O
two O
I O
tried O
had O
a O
perfect O
touch O
of O
cooking O
(as O
requested O
) O
and O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
diners O
the O
other O
dishes O
had O
a O
great O
level, O
being O
possible O
that O
the O
canelon B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ternasco I-TARGET
was O
not O
as O
generous O
the O
ration O
as O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dishes. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
again O
a O
tasting O
of O
different O
types O
of O
desserts O
that O
also O
had O
the O
very O
high O
level, O
according O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dinner. O

But O
where O
if O
this O
restaurant O
stands O
out O
it O
is O
certainly O
in O
its O
EXTENSISIMA O
winery B-TARGET
with O
some O
fans O
of O
prices O
more O
than O
accessible O
for O
any O
pocket O
since O
there O
are O
countless O
wines O
that O
do O
not O
exceed O
the O
20 O
euros O
although O
of O
course O
if O
we O
look O
for O
something O
more O
level O
of O
course O
the O
site O
and O
especially O
its O
sommelier O
respond O
with O
great O
efficiency O
and O
level. O

And O
it O
is O
not O
only O
the O
great O
variety O
of O
table O
wines B-TARGET
(red, O
white O
or O
cava O
) O
but O
it O
has O
an O
even O
wider O
variety O
of O
other O
wines O
( O
smelly, O
hammered, O
PX, O
oportos,...) O
without O
forgetting O
cognac O
and O
other O
liquors O
including O
their O
menu O
of O
cigars. O

Of O
course O
a O
place O
that O
with O
moderation O
in O
the O
drink O
comes O
out O
for O
about O
55 O
euros O
per O
person, O
but O
if O
you O
want O
to O
give O
a O
tribute O
in O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
drink O
you O
have O
what O
you O
want O
to O
ask O
for. O

The O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
good, O
it O
is O
a O
very, O
very O
recommended O
menu, O
in O
which O
would O
highlight O
the O
cod B-TARGET
really O
tasteful O
and O
at O
its O
point, O
and O
dessert. B-TARGET

We O
were O
treated O
phenomenal O
despite O
our O
little O
“faena” O
to O
the O
restaurantm O
since O
of O
ten O
people O
we O
were O
going O
to O
be, O
we O
had O
for O
reasons O
of O
salud O
4 O
casualties O
and O
we O
only O
went O
6. O

Stop O
recommending O
and O
repeating O

We O
were O
having O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
in O
January O
and O
we O
were O
pretty O
disappointed. O

We O
chose O
a O
closed O
menu O
and O
when O
they O
were O
going O
to O
start O
serving, O
they O
told O
us O
that O
they O
exchanged O
the O
brothy O
black O
rice O
with O
sepia O
for O
a O
hot O
rice O
with O
chorizo O
(!). O

Although O
we O
warned O
a O
person O
that O
chorizo O
didn’t O
like O
it, O
they O
said O
that O
it O
was O
only O
a O
“useful O
aroma O
of O
chorizo” O
and O
it O
didn’t O
turn O
out O
that O
way O
(I O
knew O
potatoes O
to O
the O
riojana). O

I O
think O
that O
when O
you O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant O
of O
that O
level O
and O
there O
is O
a O
change O
in O
the O
menu, O
you O
should O
warn O
when O
presenting O
the O
letter, O
and O
that O
if O
it O
is O
done O
later, O
you O
should O
give O
options O
to O
change O
the O
dish O
if O
some O
diner O
doesn't O
like O
it. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
didn't O
seem O
worthy O
of O
a O
level O
restaurant. O

There O
were O
flavors O
that O
had O
to O
be O
secondary O
and O
lacked O
quality O
of O
the O
dish. O

I O
am O
referring O
to O
the O
mustard O
brushstroke O
that O
accompanied O
the O
chisel, O
which O
far O
from O
being O
a O
brushstroke, O
was O
a O
lot O
and O
when O
it O
was O
joined O
with O
the O
chisel O
and O
the O
potato O
killed O
the O
taste B-TARGET
of O
these O
ingredients, O
which O
were O
the O
protagonists O
of O
the O
dish. O

Whoa! O

And O
putting O
“stones” O
of O
those O
they O
sell O
in O
tourist O
shops O
as O
an O
accompaniment O
to O
coffee... O
it O
has O
no O
name!! O

Great! O

It O
was O
all O
very O
good. O

All O
right, O
all O
right. O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
price B-TARGET
quality I-TARGET
relationship.Good I-TARGET
elwccion. O

A O
very O
good O
attention B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
selection O
and O
preparation O
in O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

Excellent. O

To O
repeat O
on O
another O
good O
occasion O
that O
deserves O
it. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
in O
August O
at O
the O
Matilde. O

It O
was O
Thursday O
night O
and O
we O
were O
the O
only O
customers O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
chose O
the O
option O
of O
the O
most O
economical O
closed O
menu O
for O
4 O
people O
and O
say O
that O
the O
quality-price B-TARGET
of O
what O
we O
got O
was O
poor.The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
an O
aperitif O
of O
sunscreen O
cream O
that O
was O
really O
achieved. O

We O
continued O
with O
a O
really O
different O
melon B-TARGET
inlet O
with O
ice O
cream O
that O
was O
the O
best O
dish O
of O
dinner. O

Then O
we O
went O
to O
a O
gold B-TARGET
that O
was O
good O
but O
was O
really O
scarce O
in O
quantities. O

It O
wouldn't O
be O
a O
small O
gold O
for O
the O
four O
of O
us. O

Then O
they O
gave O
us O
three O
chicken B-TARGET
dumplings, I-TARGET
which O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
dish. O

The O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
a O
chilindron O
with O
a O
certain O
taste O
to O
grab O
and O
the O
albondigas B-TARGET
were O
not O
stopped O
being O
that... O
albondigas. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
principal O
in O
a O
menu O
of O
25 O
euros O
does O
not O
seem O
normal. O

As O
an O
appetizer O
maybe, O
but O
not O
as O
the O
second O
meat. O

Finally O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
white O
cinnamon O
chocolate O
with O
homemade O
banana O
ice O
cream O
and O
cookie O
mousse O
that O
was O
simply O
correct. O

In O
short, O
quality-price B-TARGET
for O
a O
poor O
25e O
menu O
and O
I O
doubt O
very O
much O
that O
we O
will O
try O
more O
expensive O
menus O
again. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
in O
Zaragoza. O

Both O
for O
its O
history, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
its O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
its O
cellar. B-TARGET

Professional O
and O
close O
service. B-TARGET

The O
effort O
they O
make O
(and O
have O
to O
make) O
restaurants O
of O
this O
level O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
times O
and O
offer O
closed O
menus O
at O
an O
affordable O
price, O
is O
not O
always O
recognized. O

Excellent O
care B-TARGET
and O
quality B-TARGET

It's O
all O
very O
correct. O

Very O
rich O
food, B-TARGET
very O
fast O
and O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

My O
children O
were O
delighted, O
and O
a O
reasonable O
price O
for O
this O
part O
of O
the O
Ensanche. O

Optimal O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
both O
quality O
and O
service. O

It O
was O
great, O
they O
treated O
us O
very O
well O
and O
good O
price O
quality O
ratio. O

The O
place B-TARGET
very O
nice O
and O
like O
for O
a O
small O
group O
like O
the O
one O
we O
went. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
very O
attentive, O
and O
the O
excellent O
food, B-TARGET
I O
will O
recommend O
it O

Good O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
go O
in O
group O
with O
friends O
or O
coworkers! O

good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
food, B-TARGET
attention B-TARGET
and O
price!! B-TARGET

The O
only O

the O
noise... B-TARGET
but O
go... O
everything O
great!! O

Delicious O
food, B-TARGET
good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
right O
price! B-TARGET

Calçots B-TARGET
abundant O
but O
too O
thick. O

Grilled B-TARGET
artichokes I-TARGET
only O
one O
half O
per O
person. O

Very O
scarce O
lamb. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
very O
attentive O
and O
pleasant, O
the O
food B-TARGET
in O
great O
quantity O
and O
of O
good O
quality. O

Very O
well O
adapted O
menus B-TARGET
for O
couples. O

For O
putting O
some O
"but" O
I'll O
say O
it's O
a O
good O
choice O
for O
large O
groups O
rather O
than O
as O
a O
couple O
because O
of O
ambient O
noise. O

For O
the O
rest, O
everything's O
fantastic. O

We're O
asking O
for O
a O
menu O
of O
stickers. O

Quality-price B-TARGET
very O
good. O

Very O
kind O
servico. B-TARGET

We'll O
repeat. O

It's O
a O
highly O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Grilled O
meats B-TARGET
are O
superior. O

The O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
very O
complete. O

A O
but. O

When B-TARGET
it's I-TARGET
full, I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
local I-TARGET
configuration I-TARGET
amplifies I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
noise. I-TARGET

Good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
great O
food, B-TARGET
well B-TARGET
located. I-TARGET

Highly O
recommended. O

It O
is O
an O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends. O

I'm O
sure O
we'll O
be O
back. O

We O
have O
eaten O
very O
at O
ease, O
excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
cozy O
place. B-TARGET

The O
only O
one O
but O
to O
say O
something, O
that O
the O
first O
dish O
wanted O
us O
to O
pick O
it O
up O
almost O
without O
having O
finished, O
but O
then O
all O
great. O

We O
were O
invited O
to O
a O
jug O
of O
sangria. O

Highly O
recommended O

all O
very O
correct, O
but O
in O
principle O
they O
did O
not O
know O
the O
reservation O
previously O
made. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
last O
week O
and O
it O
was O
quite O
a O
discovery, O
although O
no O
one O
ordered O
pizza B-TARGET
look O
great O
and O
their O
oven O
is O
wood, O
surely O
we O
will O
come O
back O
to O
try O
them... O

The O
site B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
they O
classify O
it O
as O
typical O
Catalan O
food O
and O
Mediterranean O
diet O
and O
in O
fact O
it O
is O
a O
pizzeria-grill O
in O
which O
they O
also O
serve O
calçots, O
scalibada O
and O
sausages O
of O
the O
land. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
not O
expensive, O
but O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
gloomy O
and O
lacking O
in O
luminosity. O

Kind O
service. B-TARGET

We O
asked O
for O
snails O
that O
were O
in O
the O
letter O
and O
there O
was O
no, O
and O
lamb O
shoulder O
that O
there O
was O
as O
a O
suggestion O
and O
neither. O

In O
the O
end O
we O
ordered O
an O
entrecot B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
dry O
and O
it O
was O
small O
and O
a O
beef B-TARGET
skewer I-TARGET
(in O
which O
there O
were O
only O
4 O
taquitos O
of O
beef) O
and O
it O
was O
also O
dry. O

We're O
not O
coming O
back. O

Everything O
was O
perfect, O
both O
staff O
attention B-TARGET
and O
their O
products. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

I O
can O
no O
longer O
enjoy O
in O
Maur!The O
quality O
of O
your O
grilled O
meats B-TARGET
and O
vegetables B-TARGET
is O
impressive! O

Nor O
have O
I O
ever O
tasted O
such O
good O
wood-burning O
pizzas. B-TARGET

This O
Sunday, O
March O
15th, O
I O
moved O
from O
Galicia O
with O
some O
friends O
to O
compete O
in O
the O
maraton O
de O
bcn. O

Since O
I O
am O
from O
the O
land, O
I O
told O
them O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
a O
calçotada O
to O
try O
something O
that O
Galicia O
does O
not O
usually O
eat. O

For O
logistical O
reasons, O
look O
for O
a O
place O
within O
bcn, O
near O
the O
hotel, O
although O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
eat O
better O
in O
some O
farmhouse. O

Well, O
I O
have O
to O
say, O
it O
was O
a O
success. O

They O
all O
love O
it, O
very O
good, O
well O
done, O
and O
meats, B-TARGET
potatoes B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
caliu, I-TARGET
artichokes B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
scavengers, I-TARGET
really O
good. O

They O
went O
out O
enchanted, O
and O
I O
went O
out O
enchanted. O

I O
love O
to O
take O
people O
to O
my O
land O
and O
make O
them O
enchanted O
by O
the O
deal O
and O
the O
people. O

Highly O
recommended, O
both O
quality B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

Really O
very O
good O
quality B-TARGET
and O
good O
attention. B-TARGET

The O
grilled B-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and O
the O
calçots B-TARGET
were O
very O
well O
made O
and O
tasty. O

I'll O
repeat! O

CalÇots...and B-TARGET
artichokes...sublimes.. B-TARGET
I O
think O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona O
city... O

Service B-TARGET
a O
little O
slow...but O
I O
understand O
that O
it O
was O
Friday O
night O
and O
let's O
go O
that O
it O
has O
become O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
restaurant....(the B-TARGET
next O
a O
few O
pizzas...that O
watching O
our O
neighbors O
table....) O

We O
ate O
a O
calçots B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
wasn't O
bad, O
but O
it O
wasn't O
a O
wonder O
either. O

Generous O
in O
quantity, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
meat B-TARGET
left O
a O
little O
to O
be O
desired. O

Just O
like O
the O
romesco, B-TARGET
which O
was O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
boat. O

The O
best, O
the O
grilled O
flavor O
and O
the O
abundant O
amount O
of O
calçots. B-TARGET

Also O
the O
speed O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Variety, O
quantity, O
and O
excellent O
value O
for O
money, O
to O
improve: O
bread. B-TARGET

I O
have O
affection O
founded O
by O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

All O
the O
embers B-TARGET
are O
excellent O
and O
serve O
you O
warm. O

For O
children O
very O
good O
croquettes B-TARGET
and O
good O
quality O
burgers. B-TARGET

I O
had O
once O
had O
coffee O
with O
school O
mothers, O
and O
I O
had O
a O
good O
perception O
of O
the O
place, O
of O
course O
protecting O
myself O
from O
being O
on O
a O
terrace. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
we O
had O
four O
people O
all O
agreed O
on O
the O
same O
thing, O
the O
little O
dynamism O
and O
sympathy O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
then O
the O
dinner; O
the O
broth O
rice, O
the O
chipirones B-TARGET
could O
not O
know O
more O
ammonia, O
the O
normal O
salad, B-TARGET
let's O
go O
the O
best O
the O
tangerine B-TARGET
sorbet I-TARGET
and O
30euros O
for O
that O
quality B-TARGET
is O
totally O
disproportionate. O

I O
won't B-TARGET
come I-TARGET
back. I-TARGET

I O
was O
having O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend O
yesterday. O

And O
I O
really O
liked O
it. O

The O
meats B-TARGET
are O
very O
well O
prepared. O

For O
dessert O
I O
zapped O
a O
white B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
that O
I O
recepción. O

The O
attentive O
and O
cordial O
service.I B-TARGET
will O
go O
again. O

18/03/2008. O

That's O
a O
nice O
surprise. O

It's O
really O
like O
getting O
to O
the O
Silver O
Tacita. O

An O
amazing, O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
genus B-TARGET
as O
you O
can O
only O
find O
it O
in O
Cadiz O
and O
in O
the O
Port. O

We O
taste O
the O
ham, B-TARGET
the O
prawns B-TARGET
and O
the O
turbot, B-TARGET
and O
my O
mouth O
is O
still O
watery O
to O
remember O
it. O

An B-TARGET
essential I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Zaragoza. I-TARGET

Fatal O
service... B-TARGET
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
unprofessional O
and O
rude. O

prices B-TARGET
have I-TARGET
gone I-TARGET
up O
quite O
a O
bit. O

the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
missing O
details O

Good, O
we O
were O
last O
night O
1/08/09 O
having O
dinner, O
we O
booked O
for O
4 O
couples, O
we O
were O
going O
to O
order O
some O
rations O
and O
a O
second O
fish, O
but O
in O
the O
end O
we O
decided O
to O
share O
rations, O
the O
tomato O
to O
the O
Andalusian O
one O
got O
it O
for O
appetizer O
while O
we O
waited O
(a O
detail) O
the O
truth O
that O
we O
asked O
for O
almost O
everything O
and O
everything O
was O
of O
good O
quality, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
Fisherman O
Blanc, O
the O
truth O
that O
we O
stayed O
very O
well, O
the O
service B-TARGET
well O
and O
the O
price O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
get O
more O
expensive O
for O
eating O
such O
rations, O
but O
it O
was O
quite O
tight, O
so O
I O
recommend O
it, O
the O
sea B-TARGET
turtles I-TARGET
that O
I O
had O
not O
tasted O
it O
never O
liked O
much. O

Quiet O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Kitchen B-TARGET
very O
well O
presented O
and O
quickly, O
all O
in O
its O
point O
and O
well O
finished. O

The O
golden B-TARGET
style I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
port I-TARGET
very O
nice O
with O
a O
salsa B-TARGET
very O
well O
finished O
although O
presented O
without O
descamar O
and O
that O
was O
somewhat O
disturbing O
when O
it O
was O
to O
enjoy O
it. O

Wide O
and O
very O
abundant O
ratios. B-TARGET

The O
tomato, B-TARGET
as O
an O
incoming, O
is O
something O
special O
to O
highlight. O

The O
very O
good O
wine B-TARGET
and O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
pudding I-TARGET
is O
something O
delicious O
although O
it O
was O
left O
with O
almost O
all O
the O
cream O
(boat) O
that O
it O
carried O
of O
accompaniment; O
it O
would O
be O
worth O
considering O
another O
presentation. O

The O
price O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
compared O
to O
places O
where O
you O
are O
being O
pushed O
in O
a O
bad O
way, O
it O
is O
worth O
it. O

The O
quiet O
service B-TARGET
and O
leaving O
you O
in O
your O
own O
way O
even O
though O
they O
do O
not O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
your O
desires. O

We O
thought O
we'd O
go O
back. O

Gentlemen: O
There O
are O
several O
errors O
in O
the O
description O
you O
make O
here. O

Start: O
In O
this O
restaurant O
we O
do O
not O
work O
the O
rape, O
the O
shrimp O
are O
from O
the O
south O
of O
the O
Bay, O
the O
Langostinos O
of O
Sanlucar, O
everything O
regarding O
the O
seafood O
and O
the O
fishers O
are O
sent O
from O
Cadiz O
by O
a O
marine O
company, O
highlighting O
the O
chocos O
and O
the O
pot. O

I O
recommend O
that O
you O
do O
not O
miss O
the O
tortilitas O
in O
your O
meal O
and O
continue O
to O
enjoy O
this O
establishment. O

A O
TRICITE O
OF O
CADIZ, O
IN O
THE O
HEART O
OF O
ZARAGOZA! O

By O
the O
way, O
the O
tomatoes O
are O
from O
Almeria.And O
because O
of O
the O
price, O
you O
can't O
imagine O
the O
effort O
we O
make O
to O
adjust O
them, O
since O
bringing O
everything O
from O
there O
costs O
fabric, O
but O
it O
deserves O
to O
see O
our O
customers O
coming O
out O
happy O
and O
happy O
with O
our O
products. O

A O
CITY O
TRICITE O
IN O
THE O
HEART O
OF O
ZAAGOZA. O

For O
two O
people, O
I O
recommend O
a O
special B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
port I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
second I-TARGET
dish. I-TARGET

In O
this O
way O
the O
menu O
inputs O
are O
shared O
for O
the O
two O
people. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
little O
expensive, O
I'm O
probably O
not O
used O
to O
going O
to O
these O
kinds O
of O
restaurants. O

The O
quality B-TARGET
of O
the O
meal O
was O
exceptional O
as O
well O
as O
the O
personal B-TARGET
treatment. I-TARGET

There O
are O
no O
problems O
going O
on O
a O
“normal” O
Saturday O
without O
booking O
in O
advance. O

I O
can't O
contribute O
anything O
more O
than O
I've O
already O
been O
able O
to O
read O
around O
here. O

[...] O

The O
dish O
of O
saucepan O
in O
marinade, O
fried O
chocos, O
shrimp O
tortilla, O
fried O
boquerones, O
is O
that O
photo O
that O
appears O
with O
1 O
piece O
of O
cazon, O
3 O
chocos O
and O
1 O
boqueron? O

Is O
that O
it? O

Or O
was O
it O
a O
mistake? O

The O
truth O
is, O
reading O
the O
description, O
it O
makes O
you O
want O
to O
go, O
but O
if O
it's O
what O
it O
looks O
like O
in O
the O
pictures, O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
hairy O
fit. O

If O
anyone O
can O
get O
me O
out O
of O
doubt, O
I'd O
appreciate O
it. O

I've O
been O
to O
dinner O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
and O
it O
hasn't O
been O
so O
bad. O

I O
tasted O
the O
tomato O
to O
the O
Andalusian, O
fried O
sea O
origillas, O
a O
sea O
bream O
on O
the O
back O
and O
a O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
homemade O
(but O
not), O
typical O
cake O
precast O
and O
defrosted. O

To O
say O
that O
both O
the O
tomato B-TARGET
(very O
good) O
and O
the O
sea O
bream B-TARGET
was O
at O
its O
point, O
but O
there O
were O
several O
things O
that O
did O
not O
fit. O

The O
origillas B-TARGET
were O
nothing O
like O
the O
memory O
I O
had O
of O
those O
in O
Cadiz, O
there O
were B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
couple I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
people I-TARGET
smoking I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
non-smoking O
area, O
but O
the O
worst O
of O
all O
was O
the O
way O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
“maitre, B-TARGET
” O
it O
was O
serious, O
dry, O
risque O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
two O
or O
three O
steps O
below O
the O
place O
where O
he O
worked, O
he O
was O
unwilling O
to O
our O
attention O
as O
he O
was O
seen O
all O
the O
time O
in O
the O
kitchen O
talking O
to O
another O
of O
his O
companions. O

hello O
good O
I O
thank O
all O
the O
people O
who O
have O
put O
these O
comments O
because O
this O
truth O
lets O
you O
know O
how O
good O
and O
bad O
the O
restaurant O
has O
but O
I O
recommend O
to O
all O
the O
people O
this O
restaurant O
because O
very O
few O
restaurants O
in O
zaragoza O
have O
prudos O
that O
has O
the O
port O
as O
for O
example O
the O
fish O
is O
of O
very O
high O
quality O
and O
the O
meat O
is O
very O
good O
that O
it O
is O
of O
name O
of O
origin O
and O
there O
are O
very O
tasty O
dishes O
and O
the O
good O
that O
the O
restaurant O
has O
is O
that O
prepares O
its O
delicious O
dishes O
at O
the O
moment O
never O
prepares O
the O
food O

Today’s O
meal, B-TARGET
“A O
luxury”. O
All O
in O
time,,,, O
we O
have O
eaten O
some O
shrimp B-TARGET
tortilitas, I-TARGET
some O
farmed B-TARGET
shrimps I-TARGET
to O
share O
and O
then O
grilled O
entrecot O
and O
the O
other O
person O
flattered B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
sherry, I-TARGET
all O
watered O
with O
Enate B-TARGET
cabernet I-TARGET
softignon, I-TARGET
a O
wonder O
of O
food. B-TARGET
The O
cozy O
place, B-TARGET
maybe O
a O
bit O
boisterous O
for O
the O
few O
tables O
it O
has O
-15-, O
the O
friendly O
treatment. B-TARGET

All O
very O
well,,, O
the O
bad O
price, O
perhaps O
something O
expensive, O
which O
I O
tell O
you O
113.00 O
euros,,, O
a O
little O
expensive O
but O
otherwise O
very O
well. O

Surprised. O

The O
21/01/2014My O
couple O
and O
I O
were O
to O
have O
dinner O
the O
very O
correct O
treatment, O
the O
tortillas B-TARGET
and O
the O
excellent O
second O
a O
rodaballo O
and O
a O
dam O
with O
ham I-TARGET
5 O
J O
very O
good O
and O
in O
his O
point O
my O
couple O
cleaned O
the O
rodaball O
and O
it O
was O
noticed O
that O
was O
accustomed O
to O
doing O
it O
because O
it O
was O
fast O
and O
very O
professional O
the O
waitress I-TARGET
that O
was O
clean O
us O
to O
us O
we O
were O
not O
charged O
the O
bread O
such O
time O
because O
we O
were O
in O
the O
area O
of O
the O
bar O
and O
that O
with O
the O
first O
dish O
of O
tomato I-TARGET
already O
we O
had O
eaten O
a O
basket O
in O
between O
spreading O
of O
Dessert O
a O
bacon O
of O
heaven B-TARGET
that O
was O
frankly O
good O
and O
after O
trying O
many O
I O
am O
almost O
convinced O
of O
that O
it O
was O
home O
a O
detail O
with O
the O
coffee O
they O
put O
us O
a O
tasting O
of O
free O
Suckito B-TARGET
Pedro I-TARGET
Ximenez I-TARGET
The O
good O
price B-TARGET
48,00€ I-TARGET
The I-TARGET
two I-TARGET
is O
not O
bad O
for O
what O
we O
eat O
already O
that O
we O
try O
things O
that O
if O
you O
do O
not O
go O
to O
Andalusia O
It O
is O
difficult O
that O
they O
eat O
themIn O
conclusion O
will O
return O

On O
03/15/14 O
I O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
the O
family O
to O
what O
I O
thought O
was O
still O
a O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

What O
a O
disappointment. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
was O
worth O
it O
was O
a O
ration B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
and O
FOUR B-TARGET
banderillas. I-TARGET

The O
bowl B-TARGET
(bienmesabe) O
neither O
bowl O
nor O
well-know O
was O
MULTIVITAMIN O
TIBURON O
(that's O
what O
I O
was O
told). O

The O
rackets, B-TARGET
refritos. O

The O
golden B-TARGET
cod, I-TARGET
was O
a O
typical O
scramble O
of O
cod. O

But O
the O
star O
took O
what O
in O
the O
letter O
was O
“salada O
ventresca, O
piquillo O
and O
onion” O
we O
asked O
to O
change O
the O
picillo O
for O
tomato O
and O
brought O
us O
“salada O
with O
several O
lettuces, O
picillos, O
onion, O
asparagus, O
a O
vintresca O
peline O
and O
A O
TOMATITO O
CHERRY. O

Anyway, B-TARGET
I'm I-TARGET
not I-TARGET
coming O
back. O

Smell O
that O
peazo O
Pto.Sta.Maria O
good.To O
luxury. O

[...] O
Saturday O
I O
was O
having O
dinner O
at O
the O
new O
Q-Art B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
(click O
to O
see O
the O
criticism), O
disastrous, O
I O
will O
not O
return. O

Has O
anyone O
been O
there?, O
in O
which O
case O
[...] O

I O
have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
we O
have O
always O
been O
out O
myself O
and O
my O
guests O
very O
satisfied. O

On O
the O
subject O
of O
smoke B-TARGET
I O
can O
not O
say O
since O
I O
have O
never O
been O
with O
the O
restaurant O
full, O
as O
long O
as O
I O
have O
gone O
was O
semi-full O
and O
there O
was O
no O
smoke O
problem. O

However, O
I O
understand O
that O
you O
are O
so O
unhappy O
with O
what O
you O
describe. O

About O
the O
food, B-TARGET
what O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
tell O
you, O
you O
say O
yourself O
that O
the O
quality O
is O
very O
good, O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
variety, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
treatment I-TARGET
pretty O
good, O
with O
many O
details O
of O
the O
house. O

The O
price B-TARGET
for O
me O
is O
very O
tight, O
especially O
comparing O
with O
other O
similar O
restaurants, O
some O
of O
the O
best O
quality/price O
ratios O
of O
Zaragoza O
without O
being O
a O
particularly O
innovative O
cuisine B-TARGET
or O
that O
aspires O
to O
the O
highest O
quality. O

About O
the O
Aragonese B-TARGET
cava, I-TARGET
please O
don't! O

I O
will O
not O
say O
that O
there O
are O
no O
bad O
Catalan O
cavas, O
that O
there O
are, O
but O
in O
general O
the O
Aragonese O
are O
very O
bad O
and O
their O
price O
has O
gone O
to O
the O
clouds, O
I O
think O
above O
all O
for O
their O
increase O
of O
consumption O
due O
to O
politiques. O

Yesterday O
we O
had O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant O
and O
it O
was O
really O
all O
exquisite. O

The O
spectacular O
grilled O
sardines. B-TARGET

The O
Minicuit B-TARGET
the O
same. O

Apple O
pie, B-TARGET
hummmm. O

We O
really O
loved O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
deal. B-TARGET

Totally O
advisable. O

Congratulations. O

Small O
and O
cozy O
dining B-TARGET
room.We I-TARGET
eat O
very O
comfortable O
my O
partner O
and O
me. O

I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
there O
is O
quality, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
attention B-TARGET
of O
those O
responsible O
for O
the O
unbeatable O
restoration. O

The O
grilled B-TARGET
gold O
and O
very O
well O
cooked O
egg B-TARGET
vegetables. I-TARGET

Overall O
good O
price, B-TARGET
good O
cuisine, B-TARGET
good O
service. B-TARGET

A O
good O
choice. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
I O
had O
booked O
in O
El O
Real, O
and O
the O
experience B-TARGET
has O
been O
very O
good, O
both O
the O
kind O
treatment O
of O
the O
lady B-TARGET
who O
served O
our O
table, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
that O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
excellent. O

We O
chose O
tasting O
menu, B-TARGET
with O
appetizers, B-TARGET
incoming, B-TARGET
a O
fish, B-TARGET
a O
meat B-TARGET
and O
two O
desserts, B-TARGET
and O
all O
of O
them O
very O
well O
presented O
and O
really O
everything O
was O
great, O
even O
the O
honeyy O
lollipop B-TARGET
was O
at O
its O
point. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasant O
experience. B-TARGET

Totally B-TARGET
recommended. I-TARGET

We O
ate O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
exquisite O
and O
very O
well O
priced. O

The O
place B-TARGET
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
are O
great. O

A O
hit. O

I O
made O
the O
reservation O
through O
this O
page O
and O
reserved O
the O
Daily O
Menu. O

When O
I O
arrived, O
with O
a O
companion, O
they O
offered O
me O
the O
letter, O
instead O
of O
the O
Menu. O

I O
had O
to O
say O
that O
I O
had O
Menu O
reservation O
and O
I O
was O
still O
denied O
it. O

In O
fact, O
I O
had O
to O
show O
her O
booking O
confirmation O
on O
her O
cell O
phone. O

Frankly, O
I O
didn't O
like O
the O
deal. B-TARGET

But O
besides, O
the O
two O
dishes B-TARGET
I O
ate O
were O
frankly O
bad, O
they O
were O
not O
well O
elaborated O
(tossed O
with O
quail O
and O
braised O
hake). O

And O
finally, O
when O
we O
ordered O
the O
coffee, O
we O
were O
warned O
to O
go O
fast.Finally, O
very O
bad O
service B-TARGET
and O
bad O
food. B-TARGET

I'm O
not O
coming O
back. O

All O
right, O
I O
recommend... O

For O
Guiris. O

Maybe O
it O
was, O
but O
it's O
not O
anymore. O

Picpica O
specialty O
of O
the O
house O
and O
paella O
paired O
for O
two. O

Oily O
frozen O
squid O
stings. O

Oil-washed O
colored O
paella, B-TARGET
immunda O
shrimp. B-TARGET

Festival O
of O
frozen B-TARGET
oil O
and O
past O
rice. B-TARGET

With O
cAfe O
and O
wine O
70€. O

Veteran O
and O
friendly O
bartenders. B-TARGET

To O
forget O

Hi O
there O
was O
sensational O
service B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
small B-TARGET
details I-TARGET
truth O
at O
a O
very O
high O
height. O

The O
reservation O
was O
made O
by O
3:30 O
p.m. O

Until O
4:15 O
p.m., O
we O
weren't O
awarded O
the O
table. O

The O
restaurant's B-TARGET
excuse O
has O
been O
that O
on O
January O
1st O
there O
is O
always O
a O
lot O
of O
work. O

Let's O
not O
understand O
why O
they O
made O
us O
choose O
between O
the O
first O
and O
second O
shifts O
when O
making O
the O
reservation. O

We O
don't O
even O
understand O
why O
we O
made O
the O
reservation O
because O
the O
tail O
suffered O
the O
same. O

We've O
been O
to O
restaurants O
that O
also O
have O
double O
shifts O
and O
we've O
never O
had O
anything O
like O
that O
happen O
to O
us. O

On O
top O
of O
that, O
they O
blamed O
the O
client. O

More O
recochineo: O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
we O
were O
called O
to O
confirm O
the O
reservation... O
for O
what? O

I O
ate O
very O
well O
I O
went O
very O
well O
attending O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
served O
me O
was O
very O
attentive O
to O
everything O

Everything O
excellent O
except O
the O
place B-TARGET
where O
they O
put O
the O
table O
for O
us O
on O
Christmas O
Day: O
in O
the O
tent! O

Considering O
that O
I O
was O
with O
2 O
very O
old O
people O
it O
was O
not O
the O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
accommodate O
us. O

I O
had O
already O
warned O
that O
one O
of O
them O
was O
in O
a O
wheelchair. O

I O
don't O
understand O
how O
they O
didn't O
reserve O
the O
table O
in O
a O
closed O
space O
with O
the O
number O
of O
rooms O
they O
have. O

They O
put O
us O
on O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
without O
warning O
beforehand. O

At O
the O
table O
there O
were O
3 O
cutlery, O
having O
previously O
confirmed O
the O
number O
of O
diners O
on O
the O
same O
day. O

There O
was O
an O
excessively O
high O
noise B-TARGET
level, O
very O
annoying O
and O
from O
the O
menu B-TARGET
we O
hired O
we O
hardly O
saw O
a O
plate, O
practically, O
they O
brought O
us O
practically O
what O
they O
wanted. O

Good O
place B-TARGET
very O
good O
attention B-TARGET
and O
my O
guests O
were O
impressed. O

It O
was O
all O
very O
good. O

Of O
the O
best O
paellas B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
tasted, O
and O
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
lovely O
place B-TARGET
in O
Barcelona O
that O
you O
have O
to O
know, O
unique O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(but O
noisy, O
it O
is O
not O
for O
an O
intimate O
dinner) O
and O
cosmopolitan. O

The O
service B-TARGET
of O
waiters, O
excellent, O
very O
professional. O

Paella B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
good, O
although O
not O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona, O
excess O
tomato O
and O
therefore O
acidic, O
but O
rich. O

Seafood B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
and O
excellent O
meats B-TARGET
but, O
of O
course, O
high O
prices. O

He O
was B-TARGET
too O
quick, O
too O
many O
people. B-TARGET

It O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
they O
want O
to O
kick O
you O
out!!! O

Chaotic!! B-TARGET

It's O
all O
perfect. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended. O

What O
a O
good O
memory O
I O
have O
of O
this O
place! B-TARGET

It's O
not O
bad O
as O
a O
start. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
restaurant O
where O
I O
was O
taken O
to O
eat O
when O
I O
landed O
in O
Barcelona. O

First O
meal B-TARGET
of O
“business” O
and O
my O
tasteful O
memory O
reminds O
perfectly O
the O
taste O
of O
fried B-TARGET
fish, I-TARGET
paella.. B-TARGET
The O
treatment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
staff O
is O
remarkable, O
they O
are O
always O
watching O
that O
nothing O
is O
missing O
at O
the O
table. O

There's O
usually O
bread O
with O
tomatoes O
and O
Jamon O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
get O
there. O

It's O
for O
the O
best O

Very O
surprised O
with O
the O
comments O
below, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites, O
whenever O
friends O
come O
we O
take O
them O
there, O
the O
deal B-TARGET
is O
unbeatable O
and O
the O
owner O
is O
very O
loved, O
friendly O
integrates O
with O
the O
people. O

The O
food B-TARGET
has O
always O
been O
very O
good, O
I O
think O
these O
people O
have O
had O
bad O
luck O
because O
I O
actually O
go O
two O
or O
three O
times O
a O
year O
and O
always O
slago O
happy. O

Very O
rich O
Paella B-TARGET
and O
very O
attentive O
waiters. B-TARGET

We O
left O
very O
happy. O

They O
treated O
us O
very O
well, O
humane O
treatment, B-TARGET
gave O
us O
a O
double O
round O
of O
drinks. O

We O
ate O
some O
generous O
rice B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
starters B-TARGET
with O
steamed O
cockles, O
Huelva O
prawns O
and O
varied O
with O
pretty O
good O
Andalusian O
friduria. O

But O
I O
insist, O
the O
deal B-TARGET
was O
for O
the O
best.. O

<->the O
kitchen. O

<->no O
dish O
was O
successful. O

<->quality O
of O
a O
bar O
of O
humble O
neighborhood O
at O
the O
price O
of O
a O
Michelin O
star O
restaurant O

the O
service O

Good O
eating B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

Quality O
price B-TARGET
very O
good O

We O
ordered O
the O
house's O
speciality O
pica: B-TARGET
served O
cold, O
oily O
squid O
and O
bad O
overflowing, O
fried O
sardinites...immundo. O

It O
was O
even O
worse O
because O
then O
came O
the O
paired O
paella B-TARGET
bathed O
in O
oil, O
past O
time... O
I O
think O
it O
was O
an O
artoz O
boiled O
in O
oil. O

To O
forget. O

This O
past O
summer O
I O
had O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant O
as O
we O
were O
going O
to O
the O
movies O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
friends O
and O
before O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
dinner O
there. O

I O
said O
I O
don't O
like O
buffet O
restaurants, O
but O
I O
gave O
in. O

I'd O
rather O
have O
few O
things O
come O
and O
serve O
me O
at O
the O
table. O

That O
getting O
you O
up O
to O
go O
for O
the O
dishes O
completely O
breaks O
being O
with O
your O
friends O
quietly O
and O
without O
cuts. O

Besides, O
I O
don't O
like O
having O
to O
wait O
for O
them O
to O
do O
something O
grilled. O

For O
what O
the O
menu O
costs, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
“put O
on O
your O
boots” O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
fine. O

I O
particularly O
value O
quality O
versus O
quantity. O

But O
apart O
from O
all O
this, O
the O
quality B-TARGET
price I-TARGET
ratio I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

It's O
not O
the O
food O
I O
wanted O
to O
talk O
about O
anyway. O

I O
wanted O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
lighting B-TARGET
on O
the O
premises. O

The O
light B-TARGET
is O
fluorescent O
white O
and O
gives O
the O
feeling O
of O
eating O
in O
a O
company O
canteen. O

It's O
not O
cozy, O
very O
cold O
emotionally O
and O
nothing O
intimate. O

I O
think O
if O
they O
spaced O
the O
tables O
a O
little O
and O
changed O
the O
lighting O
for O
something O
warmer O
the O
place O
would O
earn O
a O
lot, O
but O
maybe O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
aimed O
at O
the O
public O
who O
will O
look O
at O
the O
details O
and O
want O
to O
be O
comfortable O
when O
eating. O

Well, O
frankly, O
it's O
a O
place B-TARGET
that's O
not O
worth O
it. O

A O
lot O
of O
poster, O
very O
modern, O
lots O
of O
space, O
to O
bring O
in O
a O
few O
hundred O
people, O
but O
then O
the O
rest O
leaves O
enough O
to O
be O
desired. O

I O
strongly O
recommend O
opting O
for O
the O
Wok B-TARGET
of O
Via O
Universitas O
without O
any O
doubt, O
it O
is O
near O
there. O

Pretty O
much O
better O
at O
everything, O
and O
if O
I O
remember O
correctly O
even O
cheaper. O
