We O
felt O
very O
comfortable. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
cozy O
and O
quiet O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
food. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
attentive O
to O
you O
all O
the O
time. O

And O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
spectacular, O
that's O
why O
you O
pay O
for O
the O
good O
food.... O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
saw O
weak O
is O
that O
I O
asked O
for O
a O
little O
Provencal B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
and O
they O
charged O
us O
for O
it, O
otherwise O
everything O
was O
fine. O

Nothing O
special. O

I O
had O
heard O
great O
things O
about O
it O
and O
it's O
fine, O
but O
nothing O
more. O

The O
meats B-TARGET
are O
good, O
but O
like O
many O
others. O

The O
price, O
for O
what O
the O
food B-TARGET
is, O
for O
my O
taste O
is O
high. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
product, B-TARGET
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
environment B-TARGET
everything O
was O
excellent. O

9reinas B-TARGET
has O
already O
been O
one O
of O
the O
best O
experiences O
we O
have O
had O
in O
recent O
years. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
at O
the O
same O
level. O

The O
prices O
are O
adequate O
and O
you O
can O
spend O
more O
or O
less O
depending O
on O
your O
pocket O
because O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
extensive. O

We O
will O
be O
back. O

Fabulous, O
very O
attentive, O
excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

My O
friends O
were O
delighted O
and O
so O
were O
we. O

It O
is O
worth O
going O
and O
try O
their O
meats. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
modern O
and O
cozy. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
quality. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive. O

We O
have O
been O
several O
times O
for O
dinner O
at O
9reinas B-TARGET
and O
it O
never O
disappoints! O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
meats, B-TARGET
the O
excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
good O
wine O
cellar B-TARGET
make O
it O
a O
spectacular O
place! O

No O
doubt O
we O
will O
repeat. O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
high O
quality O
meat. B-TARGET

We O
loved O
it! O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
everything O
was O
very O
good; O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
appearance, B-TARGET
all O
correct. O

We O
went O
for O
dinner O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
we O
loved O
it. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
great O
and O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
is O
unbeatable. O

totally O
recommendable O

Everything O
was O
excellent, O
the O
quality, O
the O
time, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(perhaps O
too O
bright) O
and O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
dulce B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
leche I-TARGET
is O
divine. O

First O
visit O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
satisfactory O
results. O

Quality, O
professionalism O
and O
price O
according O
to O
the O
offer. O

Almost O
like O
in O
Argentina. O

Fantastic! O

Delicious!!! O

Fantastic O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
even O
better O
service B-TARGET
!!!! O

tremendous O
kindness, B-TARGET
it's O
a O
pleasure! O

Very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
lack O
of O
bread B-TARGET
plates, I-TARGET
but O
in O
spite O
of O
that, O
everything O
is O
ok. O

Argentinean B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
would O
be O
nice. O

The O
prices O
are O
within O
normal O
parameters. O

I O
was O
there O
yesterday O
for O
a O
business O
lunch O
with O
a O
client O
and O
both O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

Congratulations! O

A O
good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
although O
somewhat O
expensive O
for O
the O
amount O
of O
food B-TARGET
served O
on O
the O
plate. O

The O
roast B-TARGET
strip I-TARGET
was O
normal, O
nothing O
extraordinary. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
and O
the O
matambre B-TARGET
were O
very O
good. O

The O
lighting B-TARGET
on O
the O
upper O
floor O
could O
be O
improved, O
too O
much O
flat O
light. O

100% O
recommendable. O

A O
beautiful O
place, B-TARGET
with O
an O
exquisite O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
unbeatable O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
exceptional! O

Exquisite O
salads B-TARGET
and O
meat. B-TARGET

Plenty O
of O
food. B-TARGET

Surely O
you O
will O
not O
stay O
hungry O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
excellent. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
meats B-TARGET
is O
unsurpassed O
and O
I O
want O
to O
highlight O
the O
excellent O
service B-TARGET
received. O

If O
you O
have O
not O
tried O
their O
meats B-TARGET
you O
are O
missing O
out O
on O
something O
great! O

I O
was O
having O
dinner O
with O
some O
friends O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
of O
the O
waitresses O
was O
excellent. O

We O
will O
repeat O
for O
sure! O

The O
best O
thing: O
to O
be O
advised O
by O
them B-TARGET
when O
choosing O
a O
dish. O

I O
loved O
it! O

Words O
are O
superfluous... O
I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure! O

The O
restaurants B-TARGET
we O
ate O
very O
well O
and O
also O
a O
charming O
and O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

We O
had O
Vacío O
and O
Entrañas O
(specialties O
known, O
among O
other O
things, O
for O
the O
softness O
of O
their O
meat). O

At O
some O
points, O
we O
even O
wondered O
if O
what O
we O
had O
in O
our O
mouths O
was O
meat B-TARGET
or O
a O
piece O
of O
tire. O

Disappointing... O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent, O
the O
service B-TARGET
super O
friendly O
and O
always O
attentive. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
very O
cozy. O

An O
unforgettable O
dining O
experience. B-TARGET

Great O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET

All O
very O
good O

Intimate O
and O
quiet O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
quality O
meats. B-TARGET

The O
price O
is O
a O
bit O
high O
but O
reasonable. O

Excellent O
menu, B-TARGET
exquisite O
meats, B-TARGET
delicious O
specialties, B-TARGET
intimate O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty, O
but O
the O
place B-TARGET
was O
extremely O
noisy O
(especially O
upstairs). O

There O
came O
a O
time O
when O
you O
felt O
like O
leaving O
because O
of O
the O
noise. B-TARGET

Little O
privacy. B-TARGET

Perhaps O
good O
for O
group O
dinners, O
but O
couples O
should O
abstain. O

Local B-TARGET
almost O
perfect, O
impeccable O
cuisine, B-TARGET
more O
than O
abundant O
quantity, O
extensive O
menu B-TARGET
(food O
and O
wines) O
and O
adequate O
price O
for O
what O
it O
offers. O

Highly O
recommended, O
therefore. O

As O
a O
caveat, O
I O
will O
say O
that, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
head B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
(or O
owner, O
which O
I O
do O
not O
know), O
attentive, O
polite O
and O
detail-oriented, O
the O
rest B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
service, O
including O
wireless O
earpieces, O
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
rest, O
more O
in O
terms O
of O
education O
and O
manners O
than O
ability: O
it O
should O
take O
care O
of O
aspects O
such O
as O
withdraw O
almost O
in O
a O
hurry O
unfinished O
dishes, O
tutear O
by O
default O
or O
offer O
silence O
as O
all O
response O
to O
the O
doubt O
of O
the O
diner O
in O
the O
choice O
between O
two O
options. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
by O
successfully O
investing O
in O
the O
complicated O
(premises, B-TARGET
raw O
materials, B-TARGET
image, B-TARGET
website), B-TARGET
the O
basics O
are O
overlooked: O
a O
couple O
of O
wayward O
waiters B-TARGET
who O
can O
lower O
a O
customer's O
mark O
from O
an O
excellent O
to O
a O
very O
good O
one. O

It O
was O
a O
perfect O
dinner, O
for O
the O
place B-TARGET
and O
especially O
for O
the O
food. B-TARGET

They O
have O
a O
fairly O
extensive O
menu B-TARGET
where O
each O
dish O
seems O
better O
than O
the O
previous O
one. O

For O
meat O
lovers O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
order O
the B-TARGET
Chef's I-TARGET
sirloin, I-TARGET
exquisite. O

<->Although O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
of O
quality O
the O
price O
is O
high. O

<+>The O
place O
and O
its O
location O

I O
can O
only O
say O
good O
things O
about O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
ate O
very O
well O
and O
well O
attended. O

The O
freshest O
prawns. B-TARGET

A O
marvel O
as O
it O
is O
decorated. O

Very O
nice O
and O
with O
incredible O
views. B-TARGET

I O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
touched, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
friendly, O
in O
short O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
is O
totally O
unbalanced O
price B-TARGET
quality. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
the O
restaurant O
several O
times. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

What O
I O
don't O
like O
is O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
last O
day O
we O
went O
we O
ordered O
oysters B-TARGET
and O
they O
were O
served O
badly, O
besides O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
the O
cava O
was O
dripping O
all O
over O
the O
table... O
it O
will O
be O
a O
long O
time O
until O
I O
return.... O

We O
went O
on O
a O
Monday O
night O
in O
July. O

The O
only O
smile O
we O
saw O
among O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
from O
the O
girl O
who O
took O
us O
to O
our O
table. O

From O
then O
on, O
serious O
faces O
(not O
to O
say O
grumpy), O
distracted, O
from O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
... O
who O
sometimes O
made O
us O
wait, O
and O
other O
times O
rushed O
to O
clear O
the O
table. O

Badly O
placed O
cutlery, B-TARGET
without O
the O
slightest O
delicacy. O

Badly O
presented O
dishes, B-TARGET
flying O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
diners. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
really O
bad. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
decent, O
although O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
price O
it O
was O
not O
up O
to O
par. O

Sorry, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
in O
such O
conditions. O

Regards O

It's O
not O
what O
it O
used O
to O
be...Ramon, O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
only O
thing, O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
has O
gone O
down O
a O
lot. O

Last O
Saturday, O
at O
13h, O
few O
people, O
i.e., O
kitchen O
without O
stress, O
paella, B-TARGET
simply O
pitiful. O

It's O
a O
shame, O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona. O

Business O

for O
the O

they O
could O
have O
been O

no? O

anyway, O
full O
of O
tourists B-TARGET
who O
come O
only O
once O
(from O
cruise O
ships?) O

without O
caring O
that O
the O
customer O
will O
come O
back O
again O
for O
it. O

Very O
disappointed O
by O
the O
price B-TARGET
and O
the O
quality; B-TARGET
they O
were O
not O
like O
that O
before! O

It O
was O
a O
dinner O
for O
4 O
on O
Saturday O
it O
was O
full. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
perfect. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

Over O
the O
years O
I O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
is O
a O
safe O
value. O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
data O
on O
the O
tab. O

The O
value O
for O
money O
is O
also O
good O
around O
50 O
€ O
per O
person O
but O
for O
a O
perfect O
dinner O
I O
do O
not O
consider O
it O
expensive. O

Arroz B-TARGET
caldoso I-TARGET
lamentable O
(for O
guiris, O
it O
can O
be O
even O
good) O
and O
expensive O
in O
general. O

Very O
good, O
quality, O
service O
that O
justify O
its O
price. O

And O
of O
vulgar O
nothing O
at O
all, O
on O
the O
contrary. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
those O
who O
are O
able O
to O
appreciate O
and O
value O
gastronomic B-TARGET
pleasure. I-TARGET

Personally O
this O
restaurant, O
already O
by O
the O
service O
and O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
the O
maitrê B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
I O
think O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
deserves O
a O
michelin O
star, O
because O
you O
eat O
very O
well, O
they O
are O
great O
people. B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
the O
location B-TARGET
is O
unbeatable. O

However O
the O
price O
is O
very O
high O
and O
over O
time O
has O
been O
rising O
dramatically O
without O
improving O
the O
product. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it. O

Expensive. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
always O
good. O

If O
you O
are O
close O
to O
the O
large O
windows, O
the O
views B-TARGET
are O
luxurious. O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
service. O

Reception B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
chaotic. O

As O
for O
the O
menu, O
the O
sea O
bass O
tartar, B-TARGET
supreme O
as O
well O
as O
their O
desserts. B-TARGET

We O
will O
be O
back. O

thank O
you O

Excellent O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
and O
its O
elaboration. O

Excellent O
service. O

Unbeatable O
homogeneity. B-TARGET

You O
can't O
ask O
for O
more. O

I O
have O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
every O
time O
I O
travel O
to O
Barcelona O
and O
it O
has O
always O
been O
excellent. O

I O
can O
only O
recommend O
it O
as O
it O
is O
undoubtedly O
one O
of O
the O
most O
reliable O
values O
in O
Barcelona. O

Impeccable O
service O
and O
great O
food! O

Good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
good O
quality O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
only O
flaw O
is O
that O
it O
is O
very O
noisy O
and O
in O
some O
places O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
very O
close O
to O
each O
other O
and O
I O
think O
that O
for O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
they O
could O
have O
the O
tables O
more O
separated. O

Good O
grilled O
lobster. B-TARGET

Perfect O
place. B-TARGET

Decent B-TARGET
food O
and O
excellent O
service. O

To O
go O
and O
repeat. O

excellent O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service B-TARGET

It's O
amazing. O

The O
attention O
and O
dedication O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
maitre B-TARGET
d' O
are O
worthy O
of O
a O
prize. O

A O
sure O
value. O

Product B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Catalan O
and O
seafood O
cuisine O
of O
a O
very O
good O
level O
and O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

A O
very O
homogeneous O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
will O
never O
disappoint. O

I O
repeat O
every O
time O
I O
can, O
with O
the O
family O
or O
with O
the O
company. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
exquisite O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
(fideua, O
rice O
and O
starters) O
of O
very O
good O
quality. O

The O
price O
is O
worth O
it O
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
more. O

Highly O
recommended. O

It O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
it O
offers O
quality O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
well O
cooked O
and O
with O
fresh O
elements. O

Good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
mediocre O
service. B-TARGET

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
for O
a O
birthday O
with O
friends O
and O
it O
was O
fantastic, O
good O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
sirloin B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
3 I-TARGET
cheeses I-TARGET
and O
hot B-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
apple O
puree O
.... O

Quality O
/ O
Price: O
high, O
the O
location B-TARGET
and O
the O
very O
nice O
environment, B-TARGET
but O
inside B-TARGET
there O
is O
an O
excess O
of O
noise O
that O
make O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
not O
enjoy O
the O
food, O
I O
sincerely O
prefer O
others O
where O
I O
am O
more O
comfortable. O

A O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
good O
seafood B-TARGET
and O
any O
of O
their O
rice O
or O
suquet, O
although O
highly O
recommended, O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
it O
for O
an O
intimate O
romantic O
dinner, B-TARGET
since O
the O
conversations O
of O
the O
neighboring O
tables O
are O
very O
lively, O
since O
the O
place O
lends O
itself O
to O
it, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
for O
families O
or O
groups O
in O
general. O

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
magnificent O
views B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
value O
for O
money, O
always O
taking O
into O
account O
that O
the O
quality O
is O
very O
high. O

More O
than O
recommended. O

I O
have O
been O
several O
times O
but O
the O
place O
is O
for O
tourists O
and O
although O
the O
quality O
is O
good O
the O
price O
is O
exaggerated O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
especially O
in O
terms O
of O
reservations. O

I O
will O
only O
go O
as O
a O
last O
resort. O

I O
think O
it's O
a O
great O
place, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
great, O
worthy O
of O
admiration. O

a O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
with O
someone O
special O
(as O
I O
was...) O

I O
was O
again O
in O
the O
Barceloneta O
Restaurant O
and O
I O
could O
enjoy O
again O
an O
excellent O
meal: B-TARGET

Magnificent O
starters: O
Cod B-TARGET
fritters, I-TARGET
scrambled O
eggs O
with B-TARGET
sausage I-TARGET
and O
prawns B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
garlic. I-TARGET

The O
main O
course O
was O
a O
fish O
and O
seafood O
Paella. O

For O
dessert O
the O
magnificent O
Tiramisu B-TARGET
and O
a O
Galician O
Tetilla O
cheese O
with B-TARGET
quince I-TARGET
jelly. I-TARGET

To O
drink, O
sparkling O
and O
still O
water O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
Gran O
Vos O
2007 O
from O
Viñas O
del O
Vero. O

D.O. O

Somontano. O

The O
product B-TARGET
is O
first O
class, O
the O
elaboration O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
impeccable. O

The O
natural B-TARGET
light I-TARGET
that O
enters O
through O
the O
stained O
glass O
window O
of O
the O
terrace, O
added O
to O
the O
cozy O
decoration, B-TARGET
gives O
a O
feeling O
of O
well O
being O
difficult O
to O
achieve O
in O
other O
places. O

In O
short, O
I O
will O
return O
as O
many O
times O
as O
I O
can O
and O
whenever O
I O
visit O
Barcelona. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants. O

As O
I O
have O
already O
read O
in O
some O
comments, O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
where O
you O
pay O
what B-TARGET
you I-TARGET
eat, I-TARGET
and O
you O
eat O
well, O
very O
well. O

It O
is O
a O
fantastic O
place B-TARGET
for O
the O
good O
quality O
of O
its O
products. B-TARGET

The O
rice O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
suquets B-TARGET
are O
unbeatable. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
impressive, O
with O
a O
beautiful O
terrace O
overlooking O
the O
harbor. O

The O
service, B-TARGET
more O
than O
correct. O

The O
food, B-TARGET
exceptional O
for O
my O
taste. O

The O
prices, O
depending O
on O
what O
you O
order, O
you O
can O
be O
between O
40 O
and O
60 O
euros O
per O
person. O

To O
emphasize O
the O
rice B-TARGET
dishes, O
the O
lobster B-TARGET
stew, O
the O
baked B-TARGET
scallops I-TARGET
and O
the O
"snacking" B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
fish B-TARGET
in O
general. O

Unbeatable O
quality. O

Especially O
exquisite O
cod B-TARGET
fritters I-TARGET
and O
rice B-TARGET
broth I-TARGET
ah O
and O
ham O
vice. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
paellas B-TARGET
I've O
eaten O
in O
a O
restaurant O
in O
Barcelona. O

It O
also O
has O
a O
terrace B-TARGET
impresionamnte. O

If O
you O
are O
careful O
with O
what O
you O
order O
you O
can O
eat O
very O
well O
without O
leaving O
your O
wallet. O

Highly O
recommended. O

Possibly O
the O
restaurant O
with O
the O
best O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
Barcelona, O
with O
sea O
views O
and O
great O
food. B-TARGET

Good O
service B-TARGET
but O
little O
sympathy. O

The B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
but O
the O
portions O
were O
scarce. O

Very O
expensive O
wines. B-TARGET

Indoor O
table B-TARGET
without O
views. O

We O
will O
not O
repeat. O

We O
are O
regular O
customers O
and O
we O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
service. O

authentic O

All O
the O

is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
at O
the O

level. O

The O
paella, B-TARGET
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
town. O

We O
loved O
it. O

Dining O
on O
the O
terrace: B-TARGET
fantastic, O
the O
service: B-TARGET
excellent, O
the O
food: B-TARGET
fabulous, O
the O
price: O
good, O
a O

worth O
it. O

We O
will O

in O

<+>This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O

<+>It O
never O

<+>It O
is O
a O

A O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

If O
you O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
eat O
on O
the O

...a O
plus. O

Great O
classic O
of O
the O
barceloneta O
with O
an O
unbeatable O
service!!!!! B-TARGET

You O
have O
to O
repeat!!!! O

Excellent O
raw O
material B-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
setting O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
overlooking O
the O
Muelle O
de O
España. O

Very O
friendly O
and O
professional O
service. B-TARGET

You O
just O
have O
to O
see O
that O
it O
is O
always O
full O
to O
overflowing. O

Without O
hesitation, O
we O
will O
return! O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
terrace O
when O
I O
booked O
and O
I O
think O
I O
was O
in O
one O
of O
the O
best O
tables B-TARGET
with O
terrace. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
correct O
both O
in O
attention O
and O
politeness. O

Quickness O
in O
the O
management B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
order O
and O
the O
quality O
according O
to O
the O
price. O

Perhaps O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
and O
wines B-TARGET
were O
a O
bit O
expensive. O

Orange B-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
6€ O
seems O
a O
bit O
exaggerated O
to O
me. O

We O
ate O
well, O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
it O
took O
2 O
dishes O
a O
long O
time O
and O
I O
did O
not O
like O
that O
even O
though O
the O
paella O
and O
fideua O
had O
more O
portions, O
they O
took O
them O
away O
without O
asking. O

I O
can O
only O
give O
a O
10 O
to O
their O
cuisine B-TARGET
of O
incomparable O
quality O
and O
freshness. O

The O
only O
downside O
or O
surprise O
was O
at O
coffee B-TARGET
time O
when O
they O
served O
me O
the O
same O
as O
at O
Burger O
King. O

Otherwise O
10. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
acceptable, O
but O
the O
value O
for O
money O
is O
unbalanced. O
you O
would O
have O
to O
explain O
to O
the O
cook O
that O
the O
octopus B-TARGET
is O
not O
heated O
in O
the O
microwave O
and O
less O
if O
you O
put O
the O
paprika O
and O
oil O
as O
it O
burns O
and O
dries. O

The O
rest, O
passable O
and O
without O
more O
pretensions O
but O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
we O
were O
charged. O

Very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
including O
car O
parking, O
everything O
is O
at O
the O
level O
of O
excellent O
quality. O

The O
service B-TARGET
does O
not O
know O
the O
menu B-TARGET
that O
also O
lowers O
the O
quality O
that O
used O
to O
have. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
decorated O
in O
a O
classic O
and O

style. O

Pity O
that O
the O
weather O
was O
not O
good O
enough O
to O
enjoy O
its O
pleasant O
terrace B-TARGET
overlooking O
the O
sea. O

We O
will O
return O
without O
a O
doubt. O

Good O
atmosphere O

rice B-TARGET
very O
rich, O
attentive O
and O

service. B-TARGET

Quality O
and O
good O
service, B-TARGET
are O
the O
adjectives O
to O
describe O
this O

to O
describe O
this O
already O
classic O
in O
Barcelona. O

Dinner O
for O
a O
couple O
in O
a O
special O
restaurant O
for O
us. O

Preparation O
of O
the O
dishes, O
fish B-TARGET
in O
both O
cases, O
correct O
but O
presentation O
left O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

Service B-TARGET
so O
attentive O
that O
in O
the O
end O
it O
becomes O
tiresome, O
urgency O
to O
empty O
the O
plates O
of O
the O
shared O
starters O
wanting O
to O
continually O
serve O
us. O

11:00 O
p.m. O
cooks O
start O
cleaning O
the O
kitchen; O
the O
smell B-TARGET
of O
grill, O
fish O
and O

invades O
the O

Desserts B-TARGET
not O
at O
all O
attractive, O
the O
same O
dessert B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
the O
last O
15 O
years. O

A O
pity, O
I O
don't O
think O
we O
will O
return. O

As O
always, O
very O
correct O
service, B-TARGET
fast O
and O
excellent O
food. B-TARGET

Spacious O

Unbeatable O

Unbeatable O

Remarkable O
in O

Very O
fresh O

fish B-TARGET

The O
terrace B-TARGET
at O
night, O
if O
the O
weather O
is O
good, O
great O
(ask O
for O
it O
when O
making O
the O
reservation). O

Very O
satisfactory, O
I O
will O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O
to O
my O
friends O
and O
family. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
they O
"allowed O
smoking" O
inconceivable O
in O
an O
area O
that O
said O
"terrace" O
and O
that O
was O
connected O
to O
the O
lounge O
and O
with O
lowered O
awnings. O

If O
it O
bothered O
me O
they O
changed O
the O
table!!!!!, O
after O
so O
much O
time O
of O
application O
of O
the O
law O
I O
had O
to O
change!!!!! O

Despite O
being O
a O
fish O
and O
seafood O
restaurant, O
my O
husband O
found O
the O
green B-TARGET
pepper I-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
he O
ordered O
very O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
table O
in O
a O
good O
location O
and O
they O
took O
care O
of O
my O
request, O
they O
gave O
us O
a O
table O
with O
a O
very O
good O
view. B-TARGET

We O
celebrated O
my O
partner's O
birthday O
and O
everything O
was O
perfect. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
very O
patient O
and O
always O
present. O

From O
the O
menu O
3 O
a O
good O
2nd B-TARGET
course, I-TARGET
the O
first, B-TARGET
of O
pica-pica, O
a O
little O
poor. O

I O
selected O
the O
restaurant O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
and O
I O
loved O
it, O
the O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
next O
time O
we O
will O
order O
a O
little O
further O
away O
from O
the O
kitchen O
because O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
noise B-TARGET
in O
that O
area. O

I O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
be O
in O
the O
first O
line O
to O
the O
window, O
but O
when O
I O
booked O
I O
was O
told O
that O
there O
was O
no O
room, O
another O
time. O

In O
general O
everything O
was O
very O
good O
and O
recommendable. O

They O
have O
a O
fast O
and O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

Good O
quality O
products B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

<->Nothing O
negative. O

<+>Excellent O
reception B-TARGET
and O
incorporation O
to O
the O
table. O

<+>Highly O
prompt O
attention O
from O
the O
Maitre B-TARGET
d' O
and O
waiters. B-TARGET

<+>Suggestions B-TARGET
of O
starters O
and O
main O
courses O
excellent, O
clear O
and O
concise. O

<+>Everything O
perfect. O

I've O
known O
him O
for O
years. O

Excellent, O
as O
always. O

Excellent, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Some O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
overpriced O
considering O
the O
quantity O
presented, O
but O
we O
were O
not O
surprised. O

Today O
we O
ate O
at O
the O
Barceloneta. O

As O
the O
forums O
and O
opinions O
say, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
value O
for O
money O
(of O
the O
food) B-TARGET
is O
acceptable. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
is O
totally O
overpriced O
(3 O
times O
the O
price O
in O
the O
store). O

Regarding O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
place O
to O
indicate O
that O
although O
the O
service O
is O
good, O
this O
seems O
more O
of O
a O
menu O
restaurant O
than O
a O
restaurant O
of O
70 O
euros O
per O
person O
(hurry, O
hurry, O
hurry). O

The O
distance O
between O
tables B-TARGET
is O
worthy O
of O
a O
menu O
restaurant. O

Overall O
it O
is O
fine, O
but O
if O
they O
took O
care O
of O
those O
little O
details O
(especially O
the O
distance O
between O
tables) O
it O
would O
be O
superior. O

Perfect... O
As O
always O
... O

A O
good O
place O
to O
eat O
good O
seafood B-TARGET
and O
fish B-TARGET
in O
a O
privileged O
environment B-TARGET
and O
in O
a O
spacious, O
bright O
and O
pleasant O
place, B-TARGET
although O
somewhat O
noisy O
(it O
is O
very O
large). O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
comfortable O
(they O
park O
your O
car). O

I O
went, O
once O
again, O
with O
a O
friend O
to O
eat O
at O
Barceloneta O
Restaurant. O

It O
never O
disappoints. O

Top O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
superbly O
prepared. O

It O
is O
always O
equally O
excellent, O
with O
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

A O
head O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
always O
remembers O
and O
greets O
regular O
customers, O
even O
if O
it O
has O
been O
months O
since O
the O
last O
time O
they O
visited O
the O
restaurant. O

A B-TARGET
sure I-TARGET
value. I-TARGET

A B-TARGET
"Blue I-TARGET
chip" I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
business. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
decide O
what O
is O
the O
most O
remarkable, O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
.... O

Ambience B-TARGET
a O
little O
stuffy, O
correct O
service, B-TARGET
good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

It O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places B-TARGET
left O
where O
you O
pay O
according O
to O
how O
you O
eat. O

It O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
at O
least O
the O
quality O
is O
in O

with O
the O
price. O

I O
recommend O
it. O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Exceptional O
food B-TARGET
and O
views. B-TARGET

As O
always O
excellent. O

Hemosido O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
taking O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
the O
Days O
of O
the O
garden O
and O
the O
kid O
and O
although O
we O
have O
been O
offered O
the O
possibility O
of O
other O
options, O
we O
have O
taken O
the O
one O
we O
had O
in O
mind, O
regarding O
the O
menu, O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about, O
everything O
perfect O
and O
according O
to O
expectations, O
the O
service B-TARGET
totally O
correct O
and O
diligent O
without O
falling O
into O
the O
heaviness, O
total O
a O
perfect O
evening, O
as O
to O
repeat O
and O
recommend. O

We O
went O
to O
try O
the O
cava O
menu. O

We O
have O
known O
the O
restaurant O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
so O
we O
thought O
we O
were O
on O
the O
safe O
side. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
what O
we O
ate O
was O
great, O
but O
we O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
quantity, O
which O
was O
rather O
scarce. O

We O
booked O
through O
the O
website O
and O
the O
menu O
did O
not O
disappoint O
us, O
we O
chose O
the O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
cabritillo O
and O
what O
we O
expected, O
good O
quality O
and O
more O
than O
acceptable O
quantity. O

If O
it O
could O
be O
a O
little O
cheaper O
it O
would O
be O
perfect. O

Spectacular, O
and O
two O
times O
we O
go O
and O
I O
love O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
kid, B-TARGET
great. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
not O
to O
finish O
the O
potatoes, B-TARGET
which O
were O
very O
good.... O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
very O
tasty. O

It O
is O
worth O
going. O

Good O
food, B-TARGET
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
with O
a O
great O
service. B-TARGET

The O
roast B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Lately O
we O
have O
been O
several O
times O
to O
the O
Bodega O
de O
Chema. O

The O
specialty O
of O
the O
restaurant O
(kid B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
potatoes) I-TARGET
is O
spectacular. O

It O
is O
also O
the O
only O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
eat O
with O
guarantees O
and O
great O
quality. O

Generous O
portions B-TARGET
and O
closed O
prices O
without O
surprises, O
which O
is O
very O
rare O
nowadays. O

The O
starters O
are O
excellent O
(my O
weakness O
is O
the O
poached B-TARGET
egg). I-TARGET

Do O
not O
miss O
the O
mojito B-TARGET
sorbet. I-TARGET

We O
have O
already O
repeated O
and O
will O
do O
it O
again. O

Very O
good O

We O
were O
six O
people O
for O
a O
family O
celebration, O
it O
was O
our O
first O
time O
there, O
we O
ordered O
the O
mushroom B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
we O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
all O
very O
well O
cooked, O
reasonable O
quantities, O
exquisite O
combinations O
of O
flavors, O
we O
were O
very O
satisfied O
and O
eager O
to O
return O
again. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
fast O
and O
without O
problems. O

I O
hope O
they O
will O
always O
continue O
to O
improve O
and O
give O
the O
best O
quality O
possible, O
with O
reasonable O
prices. O

We O
liked O
the O
dinner O
very O
much, O
both O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
the O
presentation O
and O
service. B-TARGET

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
cava I-TARGET
as O
well. O

We O
have O
been O
very O
comfortable. O

The O
value O
for O
money O
was O
very O
good. O

We O
will O
repeat. O

HAPPY O
YEAR O

Fabulous O
start O
of O
the O
year O
with O
a O
great O
meal B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
stay O
both O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
pleasant O
treatment B-TARGET
received, O
as O
in O
previous O
times, O
we O
will O
repeat. O

Happy O
New O
Year. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
really O
good O
but O
the O
offer B-TARGET
here O
is O
not O
the O
same O
as O
the O
one O
over O
there, O
it O
was O
5€ O
more O
expensive O
for O
the O
menu, O
otherwise O
it O
was O
quite O
good. O

Hi O
Ursula. O

It O
was O
not O
more O
expensive, O
what O
happened O
is O
that O
you O
ate O
the O
goat O
menu O
of O
32 O
euros, O
not O
the O
group O
menu O
of O
27 O
that O
you O
booked O
(32-27=5 O
euros). O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
you O
were O
two O
people O
to O
take O
the O
group O
menu O
and O
that O
is O
not O
possible, O
for O
two O
people O
is O
available O
the O
menu O
of O
32 O
and O
36, O
and O
you O
were O
served O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
menu O
of O
32, O
and O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
that O
you O
liked O
it, O
that's O
what O
happened, O
the O
important O
thing O
in O
any O
case O
is O
that O
you O
were O
happy. O

Best O
regards. O

The O
experience O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"La O
Bodega O
de O
Chema", O
has O
been O
a O
very O
pleasant O
experience O
for O
me O
and O
for O
the O
person O
who O
accompanied O
me. O

To O
say O
that O
the O
attention B-TARGET
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
people O
who O
work O
in O
this O
restaurant O
was O
kind O
and O
polite. O

All O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
to O
our O
liking O
but O
the O
baked B-TARGET
kid I-TARGET
was O
really O
spectacular. O

A O
point O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
is O
that O
at O
the O
time O
I O
requested O
the O
bill, O
this O
had O
no O
increase, O
being O
exactly O
the O
amount O
that O
marked O
the O
menu B-TARGET
chosen O
and O
booked O
by O
internet. O

Such O
has O
been O
my O
satisfaction O
that O
this O
is O
a O
place O
that O
I O
have O
already O
recommended O
to O
several O
of O
my O
friends. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
perfect O
to O
go O
as O
a O
couple O
or O
with O
friends O
and O
I O
think O
that O
no O
one O
who O
comes O
to O
dinner O
will O
be O
dissatisfied. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
ate O
at O
the O
restaurant O
last O
Saturday, O
the O
thematic B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
and O
kid, B-TARGET
is O
great, O
balanced, O
well O
maybe O
too O
much, O
but O
we O
are O
good O
eaters O
and O
know O
how O
to O
appreciate O
the O
good O
things. O

We O
were O
served O
with O
agility, O
without O
waiting. O

The O
wine O
HEREDAD B-TARGET
"RED", I-TARGET
delicious O
and O
pleasant O
to O
drink. O

The O
price O
is O
interesting, O
including O
VAT, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
deserves O
it. O

Keep O
it O
up O
and O
you O
will O
continue O
to O
fill O
the O
dining O
room O
as O
always. O

We O
left O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
delighted. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
unbeatable. O

I O
plan O
to O
put O
it O
on O
the O
list O
of O
my O
favorites. O

The O
cabrito B-TARGET
was O
great. O

Very O
good O
the O
detail B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
house I-TARGET
and O
the O
entrantres, B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
a O
cheese B-TARGET
board I-TARGET
before O
dessert. O

All O
highly O
recommended. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
great, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
a O
little O
slow. O

It O
was O
missing O
that O
the O
house O
invited O
to O
a O
shot O
at O
the O
end. O

A O
delicious O
menu. B-TARGET

I O
was O
delighted O
to O
be O
able O
to O
taste O
three O
starters B-TARGET
and O
choose O
a O
second. B-TARGET

Friendly O
and O
professional O
service. O

A O
detail B-TARGET
to O
be O
able O
to O
take O
the O
leftover O
food O
(I O
was O
with O
an O
elderly O
person O
who O
does O
not O
eat O
much O
and O
they O
put O
the O
leftover O
sea O
bass O
in O
a O
container). O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
remember. O

A O
great O
evening. O

Unbeatable O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
fantastic O
dinner. B-TARGET

To O
highlight O
the O
kid B-TARGET
and O
the O
mandarin B-TARGET
sorbet, I-TARGET
simply O
delicious. O

The O
whole O
dinner O
was O
washed O
down O
with O
a O
great O
wine B-TARGET
that O
was O
recommended O
to O
us O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
for O
sure. O

Recommended O
100/100 O

As O
always, O
perfect....Very O
good O
value O
for O
money O
and O
great O
service. B-TARGET

Yesterday O
for O
Valentine's O
Day O
we O
ordered O
the O
cabrito O
to O
order O
(which O
can O
be O
done). O

As O
always, O
fabulous, O
plus O
just O
heat O
the O
oven O
to O
180 O
degrees O
for O
a O
moment, O
then O
heat O
for O
5 O
minutes, O
add O
sauce O
and O
eat. O

I O
comment O
it O
in O
case O
nobody O
knows.... O

Perfect. O

We O
liked O
it. O

Excellent O
service. B-TARGET

Exquisite O
food. B-TARGET

Professional O
and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

I O
was O
there O
last O
Saturday O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
I O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
modern, O
different, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
fun O
and O
original O
menu. B-TARGET

The O
mini B-TARGET
hamburgers I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ternasco, I-TARGET
Iberian I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
are O
worth O
a O
visit. O

There O
is O
an O
important O
point O
that O
I O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
read O
in O
the O
review: O
the O
closed O
menu B-TARGET
of O
30 O
€ O
is O
for O
groups O
of O
at O
least O
8 O
people. O

I O
was O
there O
on O
Saturday, O
February O
11, O
and O
my O
overall O
rating O
is O
Good. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
great, O
great, O
it O
is O
rare O
in O
Zaragoza O
to O
find O
bars O
with O
such O
good O
music. O

The O
pity O
was O
that O
we O
went O
to O
dinner O
and O
it O
was O
not O
yet O
time O
to O
dance, O
the O
dinner, B-TARGET
regular. O

The O
quality O
was O
acceptable, O
but O
the O
quantity O
was O
scarce, O
we O
were O
5 O
girls, O
and O
we O
were O
not O
very O
good O
eaters, O
but O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
very O
small, O
especially O
the O
croquettes B-TARGET
and O
fritters, B-TARGET
the O
presentation B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
attention B-TARGET
from O
the O
waiters, O
unbeatable. O

In O
summary O
I O
give O
it O
a O
good O
score O
but O
more O
as O
a O
cocktail B-TARGET
bar, I-TARGET
than O
for O
dinner, O
(well O
maybe O
for O
dinner, O
or O
snacking), O
but O
do O
not O
expect O
to O
fill O
you, O
unless O
you O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
money.volvere? O

Yes O
but O
in O
plan O
to O
dance O

Hello O
very O
satisfactory O
everything O
starting O
with O
the O
attention O
in O
the O
reservation B-TARGET
responding O
very O
attentively O
to O
the O
request O
and O
then O
very O
well O
both O
the O
deal B-TARGET
with O
the O
waiters O
and O
waitresses O
as O
with O
the O
level O
of O
the O
dinner B-TARGET
we O
have O
recommended O
it O
to O
all O
our O
friends O
who O
are O
not O
few O
and O
soon O
we O
will O
be O
there O
again O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
caraoke O
because O
I O
am O
a O
singer O
and O
I O
think O
there O
is O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
There O
is O
a O
good O
atmosphere. O

Very O
well O
treated B-TARGET
and O
at O
ease, O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
for O
dinner O
in O
romantic B-TARGET
dinner I-TARGET
plan O
was O
a O
little O
incompatible O
with O
the O
theme O
of O
the O
performance, O
to O
be O
at O
a O
table O
too O
much O
between O
the O
entrance O

the O
bar O
bar, O
because O
when O
the O

arrived, O
invaded O
the O
intimate O
ambientillo, O
and O
no O
longer O
apetecñia O
much O
to O
continue O
there O
while O
people O
have O
dinner O
drinks, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
to O
put O
you O
at O
a O
table O
in O
the O
background, O
without O
seeing O
the O
movement O
of O
people, O
next O

the O

the O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
attentive. O

thank O
you, O
see O
you O
soon. O

It's O
really O
good! O

I O
have O
been O
there O
several O
times O
with O
young O
people O
and O
it O
always O
has O
good O
reviews, O
of O
course, O
without O
exaggerating! O

for O
heroismo O
street, O
it's O
worth O
spending O
a O
day...that O
if, O
it O
seems O
a O
little O
strange O
that O
Carlos O
has O
put O
in O
30 O
meters O
almost O
glued O
three O
businesses O
(the O
cabezudos, O
the O
meccano O
and O
the O
tinglado)...also O
with O
things O
in O
common...I O
do O
not O
know, O
I O
do O
not O
see O
it, O
but O
he O
will O
know. O

hayyyyyyyy O
calamidad..... O
if O
I O
told O
you O
at O
the O
time O
I O
am O
a O
former O
employee O
of O
this O
restaurant O
to O
say O
something O
and O
I O
understand O
you O
I O
was O
head O
chef O
and O
finally O
a O
disaster O
and O
that O
lasted O
a O
month, O
there O
was O
no O
genero, B-TARGET
lacked O
everything O
and O
the O
kid B-TARGET
(....) O

I O
had O
two O
skewers O
in O
the O
bar O
yesterday O
3-03-09 O
and O
I O
found O
everything O
very O
pitiful. O

With O
the O
level O
that O
every O
day O
there O
are O
in O
establishments O
throughout O
the O
city O
(including O
the O
left O
bank), O
it O
is O
shameful O
that O
it O
takes O
10 O
minutes O
to O
plate O
2 O
skewers O
tempering O
them O
in O
salamander O
and O
coating O
in O
a O
crude O
manner O
with O
simple O
chive O
oil. O

The O
waitress's O
kisses, O
the O
discussions B-TARGET
between O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
bar O
and O
the O
dealings B-TARGET
with O
deliverymen O
and O
representatives O
without O
respecting O
the O
presence O
of O
"only" O
two O
customers O
at O
the O
bar O
are O
not O
worth O
mentioning, O
and O
they O
must O
be O
happy O
to O
charge O
between O
3.5 O
and O
5.5 O
euros O
per O
skewer, O
but O
they O
are O
far O
from O
making O
good O
miniature O
cuisine. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
going O
to O
hermanos O
teresa O
in O
san O
jose O
and O
evohe O
or O
la O
jota O
in O
margen O
izquierda O
to O
see O
that O
service, O
good O
product O
and O
originality O
deserve O
more O
respect O
than O
what O
La O
Despensa O
shows. O

A O
pity, O
a O
pity O
..... O

I O
was O
there O
yesterday. O

Never O
again! O

We O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
high O
prices, O
3,5€ O
for O
a O
croquette. B-TARGET

We O
were O
talking O
about O
it O
while O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
the O
menu O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
must O
have O
heard O
us O
and O
took O
the O
menu O
away O
from O
under O
our O
noses. O

We O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
mistake, O
but O
no, O
the O
cook B-TARGET
and O
waiter B-TARGET
started O
whispering, O
criticizing O
us O
and O
laughing O
at O
us O
in O
the O
most O
shameless O
way, O
then O
they O
also O
made O
fun O
of O
a O
man O
who O
was O
next O
to O
us O
with O
his O
wife. O

And O
to O
top O
it O
off, O
they O
wanted O
to O
rip O
us O
off O
by O
overcharging O
us! O

I O
will O
never O
come O
back O
and O
I O
will O
not O
recommend O
it. O

It O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
respect O
to O
laugh O
at O
people O
and O
more O
if O
they O
are O
your O
customers. O

They O
are O
rude. O

I O
was O
there O
last O
week O
and O
it O
is O
a O
place O
lamentablelos O
waiters, B-TARGET
one O
is O
the O
owner, B-TARGET
are O
quite O
unpleasantthe O
only O
one O
that O
works O
is O
a O

who O

Nefarious, O

it O
to O
your O
enemy O

people O
you O
don't O
like. O

You O
will O
screw O
them O
for O

I O
went O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
won't O
go O
back O
even O
if O
they O
give O
me O
a O
free O
meal. O

a O
disappointment O

I O
copy O
what O
I O
wrote O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
on O
another O
website O
after O
my, O
also O
painful, O
visit O
to O
this O
cellar. B-TARGET
I O
went O
with O
some O
friends O
to O
whom O
I O
had O
made O
a O
good O
impression O
having O
some O
tapas. O

There O
is O
a O
list O
of O
suggestions B-TARGET
plasticized O
and O
without O
price, O
included O
in O
the O
menu O
and O
as O
long O
as O
the O
menu. O

In O
addition O
they O
read O
you O
even O
more O
suggestions. B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
several O
of O
the O
suggestions O
on O
the O
list, O
because O
the O
normal O
menu B-TARGET
was O
very O
unoriginal, O
all O
costing O
between O
23 O
and O
28 O
€, O
even O
the O
salads! B-TARGET

Very O
expensive, O
very O
expensive O
for O
the O
quality. O

And O
we O
had O
to O
run O
to O
leave O
on O
time, O
because O
they O
make O
shifts B-TARGET
for O
dinner. O

At O
these O
prices O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
an O
insult! O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back. O

Thanks O
to O
both O
of O
you O
for O
giving O
me O
the O
information, O
some O
days O
I O
have O
gone O
for O
tapas O
at O
the O
bar O
but O
I O
haven't O
gone O
down O
there, O
I O
won't O
do O
it O
because O
from O
what O
you O
say, O
rather O
than O
going O
down O
to O
the O
lounge, B-TARGET
you O
go O
down O
to O
hell. O

The O
economy O
is O
not O
good O
for O
people O
to O
pay O
60 O
euracos O
for O
a O
salad B-TARGET
and O
a O
meat, B-TARGET
without O
wine O
and O
dessert, O
per O
person O
depending O
on O
the O
wine O
you O
go O
to O
80 O
euros. O

Well, O
thank O
you. O

Hello, O
I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
twice O
and O
we O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

We O
also O
had O
tempura B-TARGET
for O
dinner O
and O
we O
loved O
it, O
for O
the O
main O
course O
I O
had O
suckling B-TARGET
pig, I-TARGET
it O
came O
with O
bones O
(in O
other O
places O
they O
give O
it O
boneless) O
but O
it O
was O
delicious, O
my O
wife O
ordered O
sea O
bass B-TARGET
and O
she O
also O
loved O
it, O
for O
dessert O
we O
shared O
a O
chocolate O
coulant. O
The O
second O
time O
we O
went O
with O
my O
in-laws O
and O
they O
also O
liked O
it, O
it O
was O
a O
Sunday O
lunch, O
we O
had O
ham, O
croquettes O
and O
tempura O
again O
and O
for O
the O
main O
course O
black B-TARGET
rice, I-TARGET
it O
was O
just O
right O
and O
very O
good. O

Both O
times O
the O
price O
was O
normal O
for O
these O
places. B-TARGET

Jose O
Miguel. O

We O
were O
there O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
and O
we O
didn't O
like O
it O
at O
all. O

We O
were O
seated O
in O
a O
transit B-TARGET
area I-TARGET
having O
booked O
three O
weeks O
in O
advance. O

The O
tempura, B-TARGET
a O
tremendously O
vulgar O
dish O
in O
terms O
of O
presentation O
and O
quality. O

The O
cod B-TARGET
and O
the O
cod B-TARGET
were O
acceptable. O

Dessert B-TARGET
also O
vulgar. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
more O
like O
that O
of O
a O
company O
dinner, O
so O
the O
service O
was O
not O
good. O

A O
lot O
of O
appearance B-TARGET
of O
modernity O
but O
nothing O
special. O

We O
will O
not O
return. O

I O
was O
there O
the O
other O
day O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
cordial O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
splendid, O
they O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
nice O
touches O
that O
not O
all O
places O
do. O

They O
were O
on O
top O
of O
everything O
and O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O
call O
them. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
just O
right O
and O
well O
presented. O

I O
go O
there O
quite O
often O
and O
I O
love O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
always O
very O
correct O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

For O
starters O
we O
always O
order O
the O
tempura B-TARGET
which O
is O
very O
good O
(despite O
previous O
comments), O
truffled B-TARGET
croquette I-TARGET
which O
is O
spectacular O
and O
the O
ravioli B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
longaniza I-TARGET
de I-TARGET
Graus I-TARGET
which O
is O
also O
spectacular. O

The O
main O
courses B-TARGET
I O
have O
tried O
several, O
but O
always O
good. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
did O
not O
convince O
me O
was O
the O
duck B-TARGET
breast, I-TARGET
which O
was O
a O
bit O
bland. O

We O
always O
drink O
cava B-TARGET
and O
they O
serve O
it O
very O
cold, O
as O
it O
should O
be O
and O
in O
few O
places O
they O
serve O
it O
correctly. O

The O
price O
is O
good, O
nothing O
exaggerated. O

It O
is O
certainly O
a O
place B-TARGET
I O
recommend. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
the O
kitchen O
of O
this O
restaurant, O
but O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
yesterday, O
with O
my O
baby O
of O
4 O
months O
and O
my O
partner O
we O
tried O
to O
go O
to O
the O
contest O
of O
the O
tapas O
that O
is O
celebrated O
every O
year O
in O
Zaragoza O
and O
they O
told O
us O
in O
very O
bad O
manners O
that O
on O
Sunday O
only O
ate O
a O
la O
carte O
and O
that O
they O
did O
not O
make O
the O
contest O
(that O
in O
the O
propaganda O
is O
announced O
until O
November O
25), O
and O
in O
addition O
they O
wanted O
us O
to O
sit O
in O
an O
area O
of O
passage, O
with O
the O
cart O
apart O
... O
in O
short, O
not O
to O
return, O
and O
without O
trying O
it!!!!! O

I O
am O
not O
surprised O
by O
Marta's O
comment, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
of O
this O
place O
should O
dedicate O
himself O
to O
other O
things. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
good, O
with O
a O
poor O
decoration. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
good, O
with O
a O
very O
nice O
decoration B-TARGET
("minimalist"), O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
correct, O
we O
ate O
very O
well O
and O
it O
didn't O
seem O
expensive O
for O
the O
three O
of O
us O
who O
went. O

In O
short, O
good-very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
correct O
and O
professional O
service. B-TARGET

We O
had O
dinner O
yesterday O
Saturday, O
for O
our O
anniversary, O
2 O
people. O

We O
were O
very O
comfortable O
and O
dined O
very O
well, O
the O
seasonal B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
with O
some O
dishes O
from O
the O
menu O
that O
we O
then O
adjusted O
as O
a O
menu. O

All O
very O
correct. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
it O
is O
difficult O
for O
something O
to O
go O
wrong, O
these O
sites, O
you O
always O
get O
it O
right. O

Very O
recommendable. O

We O
will O
come O
back. O

We O
were O
recently O
my O
partner O
and O
I O
eating O
and O
everything O
was O
very O
good, O
both O
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
wine, B-TARGET
the O
treatment, B-TARGET
the O
decoration B-TARGET
... O
we O
liked O
everything O
very O
much. O

By O
the O
way, O
there O
were O
small O
children O
and O
no O
problem. O

I O
was O
there O
last O
week O
(midweek) O
for O
dinner O
and O
it O
went O
very O
well, O
both O
the O
service B-TARGET
(very O
attentive O
and O
giving O
appropriate O
advice), O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
time. I-TARGET

We O
did O
not O
take O
a O
menu, O
we O
took O
individual O
dishes. O

Both O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
the O
wine, B-TARGET
were O
advice O
of O
the O
maitre B-TARGET
d', O
and O
the O
truth O
that O
very O
successful. O

We O
ate O
from O
the B-TARGET
seasonal I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
(26 O
€): O
All O
good, O
but O
you O
leave O
with O
the O
feeling O
of O
having O
paid O
more O
than O
you O
should O
(and O
that O
I O
have O
not O
paid O
myself). O

And O
the O
children's B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
a O
quadra O
cuentas; O
the O
menu O
follows O
the O
logic O
of O
what O
a O
child O
can O
eat O
without O
complications O
and O
everything O
is O
good, O
but O
follows O
the O
tone O
of O
the O
rest: O
expensive, O
but O
there O
remains O
the O
doubt O
of O
how O
it O
will O
be O
to O
eat O
a O
la O
carte, O
but O
on O
your O
own, O
having O
so O
many O
options O
available, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
will O
return O
to O
check O
it. O

Thanks O
for O
your O
advice O
Nacho... O
and O
congratulations O
on O
your O
18th O
birthday, O
be O
happy! O

In O
Zaragoza O
there O
are O
correct, O
good, O
very O
good O
restaurants, O
restaurants O
that O
you O
do O
not O
return O
to, O
those O
that O
go O
unnoticed, O
mediocre O
and O
lousy O
as O
for O
example O
La B-TARGET
Scala. I-TARGET

To O
say O
that O
in O
this O
place O
you O
can O
taste O
real O
delicacies B-TARGET
is O
a O
real O
temerity. O

To O
forget. O

Very O
well O
both O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
attention B-TARGET
received O
and O
the O
dinner. B-TARGET

We O

a O
success. O

Elaborate O

Everything O
was O
great, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
full O
and O
yet O
we O
were O
very O
well O
attended. O

We O
ate O
there O
on O
Sunday O
May O
10th. O

You O
can't O
find O
better O
value O
for O
money O
in O
Zaragoza. O

A O
menu B-TARGET
of O
25 O
euros O
impeccable, O
the O
place O
has O
a O
relaxing O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
professional. O

The O
rogout B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
trotters I-TARGET
proves O
the O
existence O
of O
god O
father. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
all O
delicious.We O
will O
repeat!!!!! O

For O
sure!!!. O

It O
must O
have O
been, O
reading O
these O
comments O
that O
we O
must O
have O
come O
to O
this O
restaurant O
on O
a O
bad O
day. O

It O
is O
the O
first O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza O
where O
we O
really O
didn't O
like O
anything. O

I O
remember O
that O
first, O
I O
ordered O
a O
vegetable O
tempura O
with O
soy O
sauce. O

Second O
duck O
breast O
and O
dessert B-TARGET
I O
do O
not O
remember, O
yes, O
I O
remember O
that O
neither O
fu O
nor O
fa. O

Otherwise O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
when O
I O
like O
a O
dessert O
I O
remember O
it O
very O
well. O

The O
tempura B-TARGET
apart O
from O
not O
being O
particularly O
good. O

Both O
me O
and O
other O
people O
who O
tried O
it O
did O
not O
like O
it. O

The O
magret B-TARGET
was O
not O
fine O
at O
all, O
it O
had O
incredibly O
small O
duck O
hairs. O

I O
think O
that O
a O
restaurant O
that O
presents O
a O
modern, O
minimalist O
and O
quite O
snobbish O
style B-TARGET
cannot O
present O
a O
dish B-TARGET
like O
that, O
but O
of O
course O
the O
sauce O
and O
the O
presentation O
at O
first O
sight O
covers O
everything. O

Very O
expensive, O
a O
want O
to O
be O
and O
can't O
be. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
at O
all. O

They O
didn't O
give O
us O
the O
20% O
discount O

We O
ate O
well. O

The O
risotto B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

They O
were O
a O
little O
slow O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Perfect O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
fabulous. O

Large O
windows B-TARGET
to O
enjoy O
"Les O
Rambles". O

Very O
professional O
service B-TARGET
with O
the O
kitchen O
in O
sight O
and O
where O
the O
chef B-TARGET
covers O
his O
mouth O
with O
a O
mask O
(very O
hygienic). O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
so O
was O
the O
service. B-TARGET

When O
they O
brought O
me O
the O
bill B-TARGET
they O
hadn't O
applied O
the O
20%, O
but O
I O
just O
had O
to O
tell O
them O
and O
they O
brought O
me O
the O
bill O
fixed. O

Fantastic O
if O
you O
go O
to O
the O
Poliorama O
theater. O

Good O
location, B-TARGET
good O
service, B-TARGET
unbeatable O
value O
for O
money. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
and O
we O
had O
to O
claim O
the O
20%. O

The O
average O
price O
was O
20 O
with O
the O
discount. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
on O
the O
page O
they O
say O
they O
have O
gluten O
free O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
they O
have O
no O
information O
on O
the O
menu O
or O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
himself O
.... O
They O
doubted O
everything. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
with O
some O
small O
details O
to O
improve. O

Speed B-TARGET
between O
courses. O

They O
should O
improve O
the O
control O
in O
the O
cooking O
of O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
base I-TARGET
they O
use. O

Sometimes O
raw O
in O
some O
areas. O

Good O
place, B-TARGET
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
quite O
cozy. O

Good O
value O
for O
money. O

It O
is O
somewhat O
more O
expensive O
than O
what O
appears O
on O
the O
web. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
make O
the O
discount O
because O
they O
said O
that O
the O
discount O
was O
for O
complete O
dinners O
and O
not O
valid O
for O
dishes O
without O
dessert.... O

The O
discount B-TARGET
voucher I-TARGET
does O
not O
say O
anything O
about O
this. O

Incredible O
restaurant, B-TARGET
incredible O
service, B-TARGET
great O
staff B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

100% O
recommended, O
we O
will O
go O
there O
again. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice, O
also O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
good. O

As O
always O
when O
we O
have O
gone, O
La O
Poma B-TARGET
gets O
a O
10 O
in O
quality/price O
ratio. O

On O
this O
day O
25/12, O
we O
appreciated O
slower O
service B-TARGET
probably O
because O
there O
was O
less O
staff O
on O
such O
an O
important O
day, O
otherwise O
excellent O
value O
for O
money. O

Everything O
very O
very O
tasty O
excellent O

My O
opinion O
about O
the O
restaurant O
La B-TARGET
Poma I-TARGET
is O
that O
it O
is O
correct, O
but O
not O
extraordinary. O

We O
ordered O
a O
risotto B-TARGET
(acceptable) O
and O
a O
pizza B-TARGET
(very O
improvable) O
and O
desserts B-TARGET
(the O
best). O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
efficient O
but O
not O
particularly O
friendly. O

They O
made O
a O
mistake O
when O
bringing O
one O
of O
the O
dishes O
and O
rectified O
it O
but O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
bit. O

In O
the O
bill O
they O
forgot O
to O
make O
the O
discount O
and O
it O
was O
also O
necessary O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
rectification. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
was O
quite O
well O
done. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
full O
of O
tourists. O

Excellent O
homemade O
food B-TARGET
that O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
mother's O
food.they O
have O
made O
a O
great O
reform B-TARGET
to O
satisfy O
their O
customers O
¨thanks. O

I O
recommend O
it, O
a O
place O
to O
enjoy O
homemade O
food B-TARGET
or O
a O
good O
veal B-TARGET
chop I-TARGET
on O
the O
stone O
within O
affordable O
prices, O
for O
those O
who O
like O
good O
wines, B-TARGET
you O
have O
a O
variety O
of O
them O
with O
which O
to O
accompany O
a O
good O
meal, O
as O
for O
the O
people O
who O
attend, O
Ana B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
owner I-TARGET
is O
responsible O
for O
making O
your O
stay O
comfortable O
and O
her O
mother B-TARGET
in O
the O
kitchen O
an O
excellent O
cook O
and O
a O
charming O
woman. O

We O
have O
eaten O
the O
menu B-TARGET
grilled I-TARGET
price O
quality O
well, O
the O
keys B-TARGET
that O
we O
have O
tried O
10. O

We O
will O
recommend O
it. O

Good O
place B-TARGET
to O
repeat O

We O
ate O
on O
Sunday O
October O
20 O
and O
we O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
great, O
we O
tried O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
pickled I-TARGET
bonito I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
house I-TARGET
very O
good, O
the O
meats B-TARGET
very O
well O
prepared, O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
almost O
too O
much, O
but O
you O
had O
to O
make O
an O
effort O
that O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
enough O
wines B-TARGET
to O
choose O
from. O

highly O
recommended O
and O
to O
come O
back! O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
bit O
to O
sit O
down, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
it O
was O
worth O
it. O

Excellent O
attention B-TARGET
from O
all O
the O
staff, O
the O
food B-TARGET
not O
to O
mention O
all O
very O
good O
especially O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
lamb I-TARGET
uff O
still O
savoring O
it, O
very O
good O
amount O
for O
the O
one O
who O
is O
a O
foodie, O
a O
little O
away O
from O
the O
center, O
but O
otherwise O
the O
tasty O
makes O
you O
forget O
the O
remote, O
it O
really O
is O
very O
good, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
with O
a O
good O
palate. O

We O
were O
7 O
people O
with O
a O
child O
and O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
with O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
I O
recommend O
it. O

The O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

We O
were O
a O
large O
group, O
20 O
people, O
and O
we O
were O
well O
attended O
and O
very O
effective. O

The O
salad, B-TARGET
the O
fried B-TARGET
starters, I-TARGET
the O
cheese, B-TARGET
phenomenal. O

As O
2nd O
course O
I O
chose O
churrasco, B-TARGET
which O
was O
sensational, O
and O
with O
homemade O
fries B-TARGET
(not O
frozen). O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
also O
very O
good, O
some O
shots O
at O
the O
end, O
coffees O
and O
all O
for O
20 O

Thank O
you! O

Today O
we O
had O
the O
menú O

for O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

It O
will O
not O
be O
the O
last O
time O
we O
go, O
because O
we O
loved O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
great O
and O
the O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
too. O

Definitely O
recommendable. O

A O
week O
ago O
we O
went O
to O
Candelas O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
it O
was O
their O
grill B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
we O
tried O
and O
except O
for O
the O
wine B-TARGET
that O
gained O
a O
lot O
by O
turning O
it O
into O
a O
summer O
red, O
the O
dinner O
was O
satisfactory. O

We O
knew O
about O
their O
summer O
offerings O
and O
said O
we O
would O
return. O

Today O
at O
lunch O
two O
diners O
tried O
this O
menu O
and O
a O
third O
one O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day. O

Very O
satisfied, O
the O
price O
was O
very O
reasonable. O

Sinduda O
repeat. O

Highly O
recommended O
and O
excellent O
treatment B-TARGET
of O
the O
head O
waitress. O

Back O
from O
vacation O
and O
it O
seems O
appropriate O
to O
return O
where O
we O
ended O
up, O
if O
the O
last O
was O
a O
good O
experience.excellent O
choice O
both O
in O
its O
grilled B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
especially O
that O
summer B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
rice. I-TARGET

Today O
is O
the O
second O
time O
we O
tried O
it O
and O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
three O
rice O
dishes B-TARGET
served, O
the O
black, B-TARGET
the O
tripe B-TARGET
and O
the O
new O
chanterelle. B-TARGET

Magnificent O
attention O
from O
Ana B-TARGET
and O
today O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
was O
a O
carajillo O
of O
rum, O
as O
it O
should O
be, O
the O
work O
of O
a O
good O
waitress. B-TARGET

I O
hope O
it O
is O
not O
forgotten O
with O
the O
end O
of O
summer, O
a O
very O
tight O
and O
tasty O
menu. B-TARGET

In O
any O
case, O
it O
was O
a O
good O
return O
to O
the O
routine O
and O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
school O
year. O

Excellent O
work B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
kitchen, I-TARGET
at O
a O
very O
interesting O
price. O

Exquisite O
treatment, B-TARGET
tasty O
food, B-TARGET
in O
an O
environment B-TARGET
without O
luxuries O
but O
with O
a O
quality-price O
ratio O
almost O
impossible O
to O
find O
in O
Zaragoza. O

Ana B-TARGET
is O
a O
luxury O
as O
head O
waitress, O
Eduardo B-TARGET
Orús I-TARGET
a O
special O
touch O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

Ingenious O
tasting B-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
that O
change O
with O
success. O

Definitely O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
every O
week. O

The O
service B-TARGET
has O
been O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
acceptable, O
but O
my O
complaint O
is O
with O
the O
reservation, B-TARGET
by O
internet, O
if O
I O
had O
not O
presented O
myself O
personally O
I O
would O
have O
had O
a O
disappointment. O

It O
was O
all O
taken! O

They O
made O
room O
for O
me O
at O
some O
high O
tables O
in O
the O
cafeteria. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
service O
was O
fast. O

The O
price O
for O
the O
times O
of O
crisis O
we O
are O
going O
through O
is O
a O
little O
above O
our O
budgets. O

Nevertheless O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

We O
will O
surely O
come O
back. O

I O
liked O
it. O

I O
didn't O
know O
it, O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

To O
put O
a O
downside, O
the O
excessive O
noise, B-TARGET
there O
were O
many O
people O
and O
the O
room O
resonates O
a O
lot O
and O
we O
could O
hardly O
hear O
each O
other. O

Hello, O
we O
went O
yesterday O
12-08-2011, O
and O
really O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
exquisite. O

I O
loved O
it. O

Sincerely, O
buenisimo, O
especially O
the O
sirloin B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
buenisimo, O
the O
best O
I've O
tried O
and O
very O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

It O
is O
very O
comfortable, O
my O
favorite O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Barcelona. O

It O
never O
disappoints. O

The O
prices O
a O
little O
high, O
but O
it O
compensates O
with O
the O
good O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
and O
the O
professionalism O
of O
all O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

correct O
and O
maximum O
comfort. O

It O
has O
caused O
me O
a O
great O
impression, O
both O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
its O
products B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
exquisite O
treatment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
its I-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

I O
will O
repeat O
when O
I O
return O
to O
Barcelona O
and O
I O
have O
already O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
friends. O

Quality O
and O
service B-TARGET
very O
correct. O

A O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
within O
the O
medium/high O
range O
of O
Barcelona. O

A O
very O
quiet O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
perfect O
for O
special O
occasions O
with O
family, O
etc O
.... O

A O
wide O
menu B-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
variety. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
attentive O
and O
fast, O
without O
being O
at O
any O
time O
overwhelming. O

To O
recommend. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
price, O
plus O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
together O
and O
you O
can O
hear O
all O
the O
conversations O
around O
without O
wanting O
to. O

I O
will O
definitely O
not O
return, O
at O
least O
not O
if O
I O
pay O
for O
it. O

It O
can O
be O
summed O
up O
in O
one O
word: O
Excellent O

Very O
good O
quality O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
well O
cooked. O

Fast O
service, B-TARGET
very O
friendly. O

I O
do O
not O
give O
it O
a O
10 O
because O
it O
is O
a O
little O
expensive O
but O
worth O
going. O

It O
should O
always O
be O
a O
place B-TARGET
of O
reference. O

We O
went O
on O
a O
recommendation O
and O
it O
was O
a O
success. O

The O
xatonada B-TARGET
and O
croquettes B-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

For O
the O
main O
course O
I O
recommend O
the O
prawns, B-TARGET
especially O
if O
you O
are O
invited. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

I O
give O
it O
an O
8.5 O

We O
always O
go O
when O
we O
do O
not O
know O
where O
to O
go O
for O
dinner, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
price O
in O
comparison O
is O
worth O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
treatment O
are O
undoubtedly O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
BCN, O
and O
I O
have O
tried O
many O
restaurants. O

Something O
that O
can O
be O
improved? O

The O
cut B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
ham O
in O
thinner O
slices! O

Impeccable, O
extraordinary O
quality O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
product, B-TARGET
the O
presentation O
and O
the O
"point". O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
lustrous, O
impeccable, O
elegant. O

Not O
a O
single O
complaint. O

As O
always, O
L'Olivé O
is O
a O
sure O
value. O

Catalan O
and O
market O
cuisine, O
based O
on O
an O
optimal O
quality O
of O
the O
product. B-TARGET

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
enjoys O
an O
enviable O
homogeneity. O

It O
will O
never O
disappoint O
you. O

It O
is O
always O
of O
an O
unsurpassable O
excellence. O

The O
ambiance, B-TARGET
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
superb O
quality/price O
ratio. O

Very O
expensive O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
they O
offer, O
I O
have O
eaten O
equal O
or O
better O
in O
La O
Flauta, O
El O
Asador O
de O
Aranda, O
etc.. O

for O
much O
less. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
I O
will O
not O
go O
back O
to. O

Nothing O
to O
object O
to O
the O
food, B-TARGET
nor O
the O
decor, B-TARGET
but O
I O
want O
to O
put O
on O
record O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
what O
the O
restaurant O
deserves. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona. O

Everything O
was O
excellent. O

The O
price O
is O
high O
but O
worth O
it. O

The O
local B-TARGET
very O
well, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
but O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes, O
as O
it O
is O
charged, O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

Another O
detail O
of O
bad O
taste O
is O
that O
the O
entertainments B-TARGET
that O
they O
put O
at O
the O
beginning O
they O
charge O
you. O

As O
always O
L'Olivé O
offers O
a O
Catalan O
and O
market O
cuisine B-TARGET
of O
impeccable O
quality. O

The O
product B-TARGET
is O
always O
first O
class O
and O
of O
an O
enviable O
homogeneity. O

Their O
selection O
of O
"para O
picar" O
is O
outstanding: O
excellent O
calamari B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
la I-TARGET
romana I-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
fresh O
and O
battered O
anchovies. B-TARGET

Impeccable O
fish, B-TARGET
either O
grilled O
or O
baked, O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection. O

Some O
desserts B-TARGET
for O
gourmets, O
highlighting O
one O
of O
the O
best O
"Catalan B-TARGET
creams" I-TARGET
and O
a O
"tiramisu" B-TARGET
of O
anthology. O

The O
wine O
cellar B-TARGET
is O
sufficient O
and O
with O
a O
very O
well O
chosen O
variety O
and O
at O
adequate O
prices. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
pleasant O
and O
not O
very O
noisy. O

It O
is O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
repeat, O
repeat O
and O
repeat. O

Excellent O
! O

Very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
or O
very O
good O
I O
would O
say, O
the O
price O
is O
expensive O
but O
normal O
in O
this O
area O
of O
Barcelona, O
now O
the O
service O
is O
very O
improvable O
especially O
that O
you O
do O
not O
touch O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
of O
the O
rush O
that O
wants O
you O
to O
leave O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
together O
and O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
noise. O

Passable. O

Good. O

Good O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
although O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
rushing O
around O
as O
if O
they O
were O
putting O
out O
a O
fire. O

They O
are O
actually O
trying O
to O
get O
you O
to O
leave O
the O
table O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
to O
take O
a O
second O
shift. O

It's O
not O
a O
bargain O
in O
terms O
of O
price. O

We O
loved O
it, O
took O
clients O
with O
us O
for O
work, O
and O
dined O
with O
weekends O
alone...until O
recently O
we O
went O
back O
with O
some O
friends O
and..... O
what O
a O
disappointment!!! O

Poor O
treatment, O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
do O
not O
make O
sense O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
noisy! O

The O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
to O
be O
desired O
and O
sincerely O
told O
you O
that O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
past O
its O
prime. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
is O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get. O

I O
had O
very O
high O
expectations O
after O
having O
been O
in O
the O
Barcelonta O
of O
the O
same O
group, O
sinembargo O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed: O
overheated O
food, B-TARGET
noisy, B-TARGET
very O
close O
tables, B-TARGET
cold O
and O
unpleasant O
treatment B-TARGET
.... O

I O
will O
not O
return. O

My O
favorite O
for O
special O
celebrations O
for O
many O
years. O

I O
trust O
him O
since O
he O
was O
in O
C O
/ O
Muntaner. O

It O
never O
fails O
me! O

Acceptable O
food O
at O
a O
somewhat O
high O
price O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
needs O
a O
renovation, O
it O
has O
become O
somewhat O
outdated O
in O
every O
way. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
nice; O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
a O
bit O
expensive; O
the O
service B-TARGET
treated O
us O
terribly O
(February O
2007); O
noisy, O
impertinent, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
enjoy O
the O
dinner. O

Undoubtedly, O
the O
worst O
thing O
about O
the O
restaurant O
is O
the O
decoration, B-TARGET
strangely O
praised O
by O
some. O

Minimalist? O

Impersonal, O
the O
worst O
thing O
that O
can O
happen O
to O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
wants O
to O
have O
its O
own O
voice. O

As O
for O
the O
rest, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
even O
though, O
as O
a O
politician O
(Cañete) O
said, O
the O
"new" O
waiters O
don't O
know O
a O
rice O
from O
a O
noodle... O
but O
at O
least O
they O
are O
efficient O
and O
attentive. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
in O
terms O
of O
quality O
and O
quantity. O

Don't O
expect O
extraordinary O
dishes, B-TARGET
but O
most O
of O
them O
are O
very O
good O
(which O
is O
no O
small O
thing). O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
needs O
a O
lot O
of O
improvement. O

Overall; O
good O
food, B-TARGET
with O
little O
capacity O
for O
surprise O
and O
quite O
expensive. O

It O
has O
been O
repeated O
in O
several O
reviews: O
the O
noise B-TARGET
is O
unbearable! O

I O
loved O
the O
fillet B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
vedella I-TARGET
with O
foie O
, O
overall O
I O
give O
it O
a O
score O
of O
9. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
on O
the O
internet O
should O
be O
more O
extensive. O

We O
were O
there O
yesterday O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
to O
celebrate O
his O
birthday. O

And O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
we O
had O
a O
wonderful O
time. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very, O
very O
good, O
I O
still O
remember O
the O
foie B-TARGET
and O
the O
duck B-TARGET
mangret I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
strawberry I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

I O
loved O
it. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
in O
a O
hurry, O
but O
it O
worked O
out O
well O
for O
us, O
because O
after O
dinner O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
theater, O
and O
even O
so O
we O
left O
the O
restaurant O
running. O

they O
don't O
take O

decor. B-TARGET

Outstanding. O

I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
many O
comments O
categorize O
it O
as O
expensive O
.... O

We O
are O
talking O
about O
a O
very O
fine O
place B-TARGET
located O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Barcelona, O
therefore, O
I O
understand O
that O
it O
has O
to O
be O
reflected O
in O
the O
price. O

Excellent O
quality, O
very O
extensive O
menu, B-TARGET
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
well-kept O
facilities B-TARGET
and O
private O
dining O
rooms O
that O
extol O
all O
of O
the O
above. O

In O
short, O
do O
not O
miss O
it. O

Fair. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad O
but O
for O
what O
they O
give O
it O
is O
expensive. O

The O
place O
is O
not O
bad O
but O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
noisy. O

Ideal O
for O
guiris O
or O
business O
but O
I O
would O
never O
go O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
or O
my O
friends. O

I O
am O
a O
regular O
at O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
when O
there O
are O
company O
or O
family O
celebrations. O

The O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
excellent O
considering O
what O
is O
out O
there. O

Highly O
recommended. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
for O
my O
taste O
the O
price O
is O
excessive O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
quality/price O
ratio. O

I O
had O
been O
recommended O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
was O
worth O
a O
try. O

Very O
good O
treatment B-TARGET
by O
all O
the O
staff O
(correct, O
polite O
and O
professional), O
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
a O
relaxed O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
dining O
room. O

I O
simply O
loved O
it! O

I O
recommend O
it!!!!! O

I O
recommend O
it, O
you O
eat O
very O
well O
quality, O
excellent O
price O
which O
is O
the O
important O
thing, O
good O
wine O
cellar. B-TARGET

Impeccable. O

Kitchen, B-TARGET
dishes B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
extraordinary O
staff, B-TARGET
and O
very O
professional. O

I O
feel O
cheated! O

I O
made O
my O
reservation O
by O
phone, O
if O
at O
22:00 O
and O
they O
tell O
me O
that O
the O
show O
starts O
at O
23:30. O

Perfectly O
clear O
on O
a O
sign O
at O
the O
entrance O
at O
23:30 O
on O
Saturday O
"Las O
Posesas". O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
had O
dinner O
correctly, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary, O
the O
sorbets B-TARGET
were O
mediocre, O
not O
to O
say O
that O
they O
were O
not O
up O
to O
the O
price O
paid, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
bad O
so O
far O
so O
good, O
about O
a O
quarter O
past O
twelve O
o'clock O
"Las O
Posesas" O
appeared, O
they O
began O
to O
take O
pictures O
with O
some O
customers O
and O
to O
walk O
around O
the O
place. O

At O
one O
o'clock O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
already O
asleep O
waiting O
for O
the O
promised O
show O
and O
we O
left, O
before O
leaving O
I O
told O
a O
bar B-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
and O
he O
no O
longer O
answered O
me O
as O
at O
the O
beginning O
with O
good O
words O
and O
education O
now O
tells O
me O
that O
it O
is O
not O
his O
problem O
and O
that O
he O
was O
not O
to O
blame O
that O
the O
show O
indicated O
at O
23:30 O
was O
one O
o'clock O
and O
had O
not O
started. O

Poseso O
I O
feel O
cheated O
I O
booked O
a O
dinner O
with O
show O
and O
I O
left O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
later O
without O
seeing O
the O
show, O
I O
paid O
66 O
€ O
for O
dinner O
for O
two O
I O
could O
have O
gone O
to O
any O
other O
restaurant O
that O
for O
that O
amount O
would O
have O
dined O
the O
same O
or O
better O
and O
I O
was O
cheated O
I O
did O
not O
enjoy O
any O
performance. O

You O
value O

We O
were O
there O
for O
dinner O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time. O

The B-TARGET
Posesas I-TARGET
performed O
and O
made O
a O
very O
entertaining O
and O
funny O
show B-TARGET
both O
on O
stage O
and O
when O
they O
are O
with O
people O
taking O
pictures, O
they O
are O
very O
nice. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
were O
good O
and O
it O
was O
nice O
that O
the O
show B-TARGET
started O
when O
we O
finished O
dinner. O

We O
have O
been O
there O
more O
than O
once. O

I O
was O
with O
a O
friend O
this O
past O
Friday, O
I O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
her O
because O
I O
had O
been O
there O
before O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
different O
place, B-TARGET
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
dine, O
have O
a O
fun O
time, O
have O
a O
drink O
and O
dinner, O
well, O
total O
disappointment, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
before O
more O
innovative, O
now O
it O
has O
become O
just O
another O
restaurant. O

We O
had O
dinner O
a O
la O
carte, O
the O
stick B-TARGET
tartar I-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
meat; B-TARGET
for O
the O
price O
it O
was O
tough, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
a O
very O
good O
tasting, O
in O
short O
I O
found O
it O
very O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
had O
for O
dinner, O
we O
went O
out O
at O
60 O
€ O
per O
head. O

All O
an O
excess O
the O
truth. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back. O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

They O
serve O
delicious O
dishes, B-TARGET
whether O
new O
or O
traditional. O

The O
maître O
d' O
recommended O
two O
wines, B-TARGET
a O
red O
and O
a O
white, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
success. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
attentive. O

When O
the O
dishes O
are O
served, O
the O
manager B-TARGET
gives O
succinct O
and O
pertinent O
explanations O
that O
are O
appreciated. O

With O
so O
many O
virtues, O
I O
was O
expecting O
a O
cannon O
fire O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
family O
dinner O
we O
celebrated O
there. O

But O
it O
was O
not O
like O
that. O

In O
total, O
190 O
euros O
for O
six O
people. O

A O
reasonable O
price, O
in O
my O
opinion. O

Highly O
recommended. O

We O
will O
be O
back. O

<->it O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
or O
a O
cafe O
of O
Mediterranean O
cuisine, O
is O
a O
"place" O
where O
they O
have O
a O
mini O
menu O
of O
tapas, B-TARGET
served O
on O
trays O
in O
which O
you O
can O
hardly O
use O
as O
a O
dish, O
with O
an O
average O
quality O
of O
the O
same, O
and O
to O
subsist O
offer O
a O
menu O
of O
nine O
euros, O
A O
GOOD O
UNDERSTANDING O
A O
FEW O
WORDS O
ARE O
ENOUGH. O

<+>nothing O

the O
service B-TARGET
very O
correct, O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good O
exceoti O
the O
tiramisu, B-TARGET
that O
for O
my O
taste, O
was O
bitter. O

The O
kindness O
with O
which O
we O
were O
treated O
was O
exquisite. O

The O
elaboration O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
the O
menu O
that O
efrecian O
of O
20 O
€, O
exceptional. O

they O
take O
great O
care O
to O
do O
it O
well O

<->The O
menu B-TARGET
booked O
on O
the O
Internet, O
was O
not, O
the O
air O
did O
not O
work, O
very O
hot, O
the O
treatment O
of O
the O
manager B-TARGET
was O
not O
correct O
and O
the O
food, B-TARGET
not O
good, O
nor O
in O
quantity. O

<+>The O
Catalan O
waitress O
who O
served O
us. O

The O
restaurant, O
phenomenal, O
both O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
pity O
is O
that O
the O
offer O
of O
40% O
on O
the O
menu, O
was O
not O
such. O

The O
discount O
does O
not O
apply O
to O
tapas O
(also O
on O
the O
menu), O
nor O
desserts O
(also O
on O
the O
menu) O
nor O
drinks O
(this O
is O
normal). O

So O
the O
discount O
is O
basically O
on O
main O
courses O
and O
salads O
(few O
on O
the O
menu). O

For O
6 O
people, O
we O
ordered O
3 O
tapas, O
1 O
salad, O
6 O
main O
courses O
and O
3 O
desserts O
plus O
drinks. O

We O
came O
out O
at O
28€ O
per O
person O
(including O
the O
discount O
on O
the O
main O
course). O

If O
you O
don't O
apply O
the O
discount O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
expensive. O

And O
although O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
worthwhile O
(as O
well O
as O
the O
service), B-TARGET
the O
environment, B-TARGET
local B-TARGET
and O
terrace, B-TARGET
could O
be O
better. O

Quality O
and O
price O
very O
reasonable, O
having O
30% O
on O
the O
menu O
(only O
meals). O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
sufficient. O

We O
didn't O
order O
anything O
special, O
just O
a O
rice B-TARGET
dish, O
which O
was O
just O
right O
and O
you O
could O
tell O
that O
the O
fish B-TARGET
was O
of O
high O
quality. O

The O
sangria B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
cava I-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

It O
is O
recommended O
on O
site. O

Good O
quality O
and O
correct O
quantity. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
fast O
and O
friendly. O

Pleasant. O

Very O
good O
attention. B-TARGET

I O
did O

What O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
to O
know O
the O
Cafe B-TARGET
de I-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
unique, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
attentive O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
a O
10. O

They O
offered O
us O
fresh O
eggs B-TARGET
from O
their O
hens O
and O
they O
were O
exquisite. O

We O
will O
surely O
return O
for O
lunch O
on O
the O
terrace, O
or O
for O
breakfast O
on O
the O
weekend. O

I O
recommend O
it O

Only O
one O
(constructive) O
criticism O

In O
terms O
of O
ambience, B-TARGET
everything O
was O
very O
correct, O
decoration, O
music, O
ambience, O
etc. O

Except O
for O
the O
air O
freshener B-TARGET
used O
in O
the O
restaurant O

Too O
strong, O
almost O
offensive O

It O
detracts O
from O
the O
good O
food B-TARGET
served O
with O
care... O
to O
improve O
this O
point. O

I O
went O
with O
some O
clients, O
there O
were O
8 O
of O
us O
and O
we O
loved O
it. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
exquisite, O
especially O
the O
scrambled B-TARGET
eggs, I-TARGET
which O
they O
explained O
to O
me O
were O
from O
their O
farm/masia. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
impeccable. O

They O
also O
have O
private O
rooms O
for O
group O
meals. O

I O
will O
keep O
it O
in O
mind O
for O
the O
next O
time. O

I O
recommend O
it! O

A O
quiet O
place B-TARGET
with O
few O
tables. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
of O
great O
quality O
but O
it O
is O
according O
to O
the O
price. O

Especially O
interesting O
with O
the O
30% O
discount. O

Very O
quiet O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
very O
clean, O
the O
dishes O
lacked O
a O
little O
more O
food, B-TARGET
for O
the O
high O
prices O
it O
has, O
but O
all O
in O
all O
very O
correct, O
curious O
decoration. B-TARGET

We O
arrived O
at O
22.30 O
at O
the O
time O
we O
had O
the O
reservation, O
and O
the O
only O
person O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
a O
Pakistani O
who O
barely O
spoke O
Spanish, O
told O
us O
that O
our O
reservation O
was O
at O
21.30. O

When O
we O
insisted O
that O
it O
was O
at O
22.30 O
for O
sure, O
he O
looked O
at O
the O
reservation O
papers, O
and O
we O
saw O
how O
they O
had O
printed O
our O
reservation O
form. O

My O
husband O
began O
to O
read O
our O
data, O
where O
the O
time O
appeared O
very O
clearly. O

He O
quickly O
changed O
the O
sheet, O
and O
wanted O
us O
to O
believe O
that O
they O
had O
confused O
us O
with O
another O
table O
they O
had O
at O
8.30 O
pm. O

The O
whole O
thing O
was O
a O
lie, O
they O
should O
have O
wanted O
to O
close O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
table O
of O
two O
that O
came O
with O
a O
discount O
of O
30% O
and O
they O
lied O
to O
us O
shamelessly. O

So O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
another O
place O
for O
dinner, O
and O
after O
a O
while O
the O
same O
man O
called O
us O
saying O
that O
if O
we O
came O
back O
he O
would O
invite O
us, O
we O
deduce O
that O
to O
prevent O
us O
from O
giving O
him O
bad O
publicity. O

Evidently O
we O
will O
not O
return O
nor O
do O
we O
believe O
anything O
of O
that O
invitation. O

A O
disgrace O
everything. O

We O
were O
advised O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
successful. O

The O
internet O
booking O
discount O
was O
respected. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
was O
quite O
cozy. O

A O
pleasure O
that O
you O
can O
eat O
at O
16:00 O
so O
quietly O
and O
so O
comfortable. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
we O
chose O
seemed O
very O
appropriate. O

Good O
cooking B-TARGET
and O
good O
treatment, B-TARGET
we O
will O
repeat!!!! O

Good O
value O
for O
money O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET

Small O
and O
very O
cozy O
restaurant, B-TARGET
very O
quiet, O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
and O
presentation B-TARGET
according O
to O
expectations. O

I O
recommend O
the O
seafood O
paella B-TARGET
and O
sangria B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
cava. I-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back. O

Very O
good O
service; B-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
has O
a O
great O
atmosphere, O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
find; O
in O
the O
reservation O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
farthest O
table, O
because O
we O
were O
going O
with O
a O
child, O
and O
they O
gave O
it O
to O
us O
without O
any O
problem O
(and O
the O
place O
is O
small). O

The O
Valentine's B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
great, O
very O
good, O
varied, O
and O
with O
high O
quality O
food, B-TARGET
it O
was O
delicious. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
great, O
cheerful, O
kind, O
friendly O
and O
attentive. O

For O
what O
was O
the O
menu, O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
about O
the O
price. O

Totally O
recommended! O

Well O
decorated O
restaurant, B-TARGET
although O
with O
small O
spaces. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
attentive. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
not O
over O
the O
top. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
were O
quite O
scarce. O

Some O
of O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
not O
up O
to O
the O
money O
paid. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great. O

We O
went O
on O
a O
very O
quiet O
night, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
tables, O
I O
guess O
that O
influenced O
the O
service O
but O
I O
still O
recommend O
it. O

Very O
original O
place, B-TARGET
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
service. B-TARGET

The O
truth O
is O
that O
this O
restaurant O
has O
surprised O
us O
by O
the O
value O
for O
money, O
it O
is O
not O
cheap, O
but O
everything O
is O
great O
and O
in O
sufficient O
quantities, O
we O
loved O
both O
my O
husband O
and O
me. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
are O
good O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
slow. O

We O
went O
in O
at O
22:00 O
and O
left O
at O
12:45 O
and O
we O
didn't O
have O
desserts O
or O
drinks. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
ambiance B-TARGET
was O
pleasant. O

The O
lighting B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
dim, O
but O
cozy. O

A O
bit O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is, O
but O
well, O
being O
in O
the O
born O
you O
know O
.... O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure. O

Nice O
place, B-TARGET
comfortable O
and O
modern, O
with O
a O
careful O
and O
good O
quality O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Regular. O

Good O
decoration, B-TARGET
normal O
food, B-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
noise B-TARGET
and O
somewhat O
expensive. O

2 O
starters O
and O
2 O
main O
courses, O
with O
wine O
20 O
€, O
without O
dessert O
or O
water, O
110 O
€. O

It's O
ok, O
but O
I O
think O
they O
work O
for O
occasional O
clients, O
and O
I O
won't O
repeat. O

By O
the O
way, O
paying O
almost O
5€ O
for O
cutlery O
always O
annoys O
me. O

I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
restaurant; B-TARGET
they O
treated O
us O
in O
a O
casual O
but O
professional O
way; O
the O
food, B-TARGET
all O
dishes O
excellent O
quality O
and O
tasty; O
I O
will O
come O
back O
soon! O

A O
good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
exquisite O
and O
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
professional, O
quality O
dishes, B-TARGET
well O
cooked O
and O
correct O
portions. B-TARGET

You O
don't O
mind O
paying O
to O
be O
well O
served O
and O
eat O
well O
. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

We O
all O
liked O
the O
food. B-TARGET

A O
hair O
more O
expensive O
than O
we O
expected. O

Very O
pleasant O
and O
lively O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended. O

It O
was O
our O
first O
visit O
to O
Kafka B-TARGET
and O
we O
will O
surely O
repeat O
in O
our O
next O
trips O
to O
Barcelona. O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
dishes. B-TARGET

We O
loved O
everything O
we O
tried. O

The O
fried B-TARGET
artichokes I-TARGET
are O
well O
deserved. O

Highly O
recommended. O

Really O
100% O
recommendable O

Interesting O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
Born, O
great O
quality O
in O
the O
product B-TARGET
used, O
perhaps O
the O
only O
but O
would O
be O
that O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
noisy O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
a O
little O
close O
together. O

They O
have O
not O
changed O
anything, O
well O
if O
for O
the O
better O
with O
the O
new O
Asian O
style O
dishes, O
after O
a O
long O
time O
without O
returning, O
for O
work O
reasons, O
I O
still O
think O
it O
is O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona, O
great O
food, B-TARGET
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
we O
were O
4 O
hours O
very O
well O
spent, O
I O
recommend O
it O
and O
hope O
to O
return O
soon. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it! O

Attentive O
and O
efficient O
service B-TARGET
and O
great O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

It O
met O
our O
expectations. O

Perhaps O
the O
distribution B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tables I-TARGET
could O
be O
improved, O
as O
some O
of O
them O
are O
too O
close O
together, O
and O
others O
are O
very O
close O
to O
the O
bar, O
and O
therefore, O
people O
are O
continually O
passing O
by O
the O
diners. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
the O
ambience B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
exceptional O
as O
well O
as O
the O
service B-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
friendly O
at O
all O
times. O

Unfortunately O
the O
value O
for O
money O
seems O
bad O
to O
me O
as O
the O
food B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
price. O

Nice O
place, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
medium-high O
marks O
and O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

Recommended. O

Attentive O
and O
efficient O
service, B-TARGET
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Friendly O
atmosphere, O
not O
recommended O
for O
business. O

Prices: O
correct, O
normal O
in O
these O
times. O

Tasting B-TARGET
plate: I-TARGET
a O
little O
too O
abundant, O
but O
well O
cooked. O

Only O
critical O
comments: O
poor O
lighting B-TARGET
for O
a O
restaurant; O
here O
the O
decoration O
is O
more O
important O
than O
the O
function. O

It O
is O
also O
not O
advisable O
to O
mix O
too O
much O
the O
customers O
who O
have O
drinks O
with O
the O
diners. O

Otherwise, O
highly O
recommended. O

Excellent O
value O
for O
money O
in O
the O
lunch B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
in O
a O
very O
well O
decorated O
chic O
place. B-TARGET

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
description O
that O
bcnrestaurantes O
made O
of O
Kafka O
was O
very O
accurate. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
attentive O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good. O

Absolutely O
recommendable. O

Highly O
recommended, O
for O
ambience B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

Warm O
and O
pleasant O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
correct O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

We O
had O
dinner O
with O
three O
people O
and O
we O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

Good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

And O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
nicely O
decorated O
and O
very O
cozy. O

A O
place B-TARGET
that O
makes O
you O
feel O
at O
home. O

Excellent O
food, O
unbeatable O
product B-TARGET
and O
a O
correct O
service. B-TARGET

If O
I O
have O
to O
find O
a O
downside, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
together. O

Nice O
for O
drinks, B-TARGET
cocktails B-TARGET
and O
a O
glass O
of O
wine. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it, O
it O
will O
not O
leave O
you O
indifferent. O

To O
begin O
with, O
the O
plate B-TARGET
and O
the O
napkin B-TARGET
had O
black O
charcoal O
on O
them. O

We O
ordered O
croquettes O
and O
a O
changet O
as O
a O
starter, O
we O
were O
2 O
people. O

The O
changet B-TARGET
was O
brine. O

For O
the O
second O
course O
we O
ordered O
a O
black O
rice O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
allioli O
sauce O
to O
go O
with O
it. O

The O
croquettes O
were O
literally O
thrown O
on O
the O
table O
without O
a O
word O
from O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
because O
a O
friend O
of O
hers O
was O
coming O
through O
the O
door O
and O
she O
sat O
down O
to O
talk O
to O
him. O

When O
the O
rice O
arrived, O
I O
reminded O
her O
about O
the O
sauce O
and O
she O
didn't O
deign O
to O
answer O
me. O

I O
started O
to O
eat, O
so O
that O
the O
rather O
meager O
portion B-TARGET
would O
not O
get O
cold O
and O
oh O
surprise O
it O
was O
also O
a O
brine O
soaked O
in O
ink. O

For O
the O
third O
time O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
sauce O
and O
then O
he O
deigned O
to O
answer O
me O
that O
they O
do O
not O
have O
it O
and O
they O
have O
to O
make O
it O
at O
the O
moment, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
that O
he O
could O
have O
explained O
it O
to O
me O
from O
the O
beginning O
and O
I O
would O
have O
decided O
whether O
I O
chose O
the O
dish O
or O
not O
because O
once O
eaten O
there O
was O
no O
point O
in O
bringing O
it. O

At O
that O
moment O
he O
realized O
his O
negligent O
behavior O
and O
tried O
an O
apology O
for O
his O
total O
lack O
of O
professionalism O
and O
attention. O

Lastly, O
since O
some O
restaurants O
do O
not O
charge O
for O
table O
service O
and O
others O
do, O
they O
could O
explain O
it O
on O
the O
menu O
so O
we O
could O
decide O
whether O
to O
leave O
or O
not. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
amazing, O
it's O
like O
being O
in O
New O
York O
and O
Paris O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
spectacular O
decoration, B-TARGET
incredible O
staff B-TARGET
and O
their O
fresh O
market O
food B-TARGET
fascinated O
me, O
I O
recommend O
you O
guys, O
good O
luck. O

Everything O
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly. O

Hello O
JOse O
we O
have O
been O
several O
times O
in O
Pelentos O
de O
Sandiniés, O
and O
I O
think O
like O
you, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
recommendable O
dining B-TARGET
room. I-TARGET

I O
think O
that O
in O
the O
magnificent O
photographic O
report O
that O
you O
have O
made O
there O
is O
a O
mistake O
where O
you O
say O
Ajoarriero O
is O
not O
so, O
what O
the O
photo O
is O
stuffed O
peppers. O

And O
the O
special O
menu O
is O
not O
at O
30 O
but O
at O
27 O
euros. O

Regarding O
the O
children O
and O
the O
stairs O
I O
think O
it's O
our O
problem O
and O
we O
will O
grow, O
I've O
had O
to O
be O
quite O
pretos O
all O
and O
be O
very O
comfortable, O
anyway O
we O
go O
to O
eat O
and O
I O
do O
that O
I O
relax, O
eat O
and O
appreciate O
what O
they O
give O
me O
without O
asking O
qu O
is O
education, O
love O
and O
a O
smile. O

And O
now O
Jose O
I O
ask O
you O
what O
right O
do O
we O
have O
to O
talk O
about O
anyone O
on O
the O
net O
without O
asking O
permission? O

even O
if O
it O
is O
to O
speak O
well. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
update O
your O
information O
now O
have O
a O
Spring B-TARGET
Menu I-TARGET
for O
19 O
euros O
and O
children's B-TARGET
menu O
for O
15 O
euros O
that O
is O
great, O
I O
recommend O
you O
return, O
just O
as O
I O
do O
and O
so O
maybe O
it O
is O
judged O
more O
fairly O
(we O
already O
have O
a O
table O
reserved O
for O
April O
28, O
we O
celebrate O
my O
birthday). O

Best O
regards O
Joaquina O

Hello O
Joaquina, O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
clarifications O
of O
the O
photos, O
with O
respect O
to O
prices O
also O
thank O
you O
for O
giving O
the O
new O
prices, O
in O
the O
articles O
I O
indicate O
the O
price O
that O
was O
at O
the O
time.only O
clarify O
that O
in O
the O
review O
I O
do O
not O
speak O
of O
anyone, O
I'm O
just O
telling O
my O
experience O
using O
the O
services O
of O
a O
company, O
in O
this O
case O
a O
restaurant, O
which O
I O
paid O
rigorously. O

Can't O
we O
even O
have O
an O
opinion O
about O
what O
we O
buy? O

I O
would O
like O
to O
think O
so. O

Anything O
else O
would O
be O
censorship O
and O
coercion. O

We O
were O
recommended O
for O
dinner O
on O
Christmas O
Eve O
and O
we O
were O
very O
disappointed: O
not O
only O
the O
raw O
materials B-TARGET
left O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
(scrambled O
shrimp O
and O
mushrooms O
from O
a O
pre-frozen O
bag) O
but O
the O
quantities B-TARGET
were O
derisory O
for O
the O
price. O

The O
baked O
cod B-TARGET
(specialty O
of O
the O
house) O
was O
corked O
and O
hard, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
deer B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
(26euros O
a O
plate) O
was O
scarce O
and O
barely O
without O
garnish.in O
short, O
it O
is O
presumed O
a O
quality O
backed O
by O
several O
awards O
and O
we O
have O
found O
a O
rather O
mediocre O
meal. B-TARGET

Hello, O
I O
want O
to O
leave O
my O
opinion O
about O
this O
restaurant O
in O
the O
only O
visit O
I O
have O
made, O
I O
fully O
agree O
with O
Mr. O
Aranda O
that O
the O
quantity O
is O
quite O
scarce O
in O
some O
dishes B-TARGET
in O
relation O
to O
their O
price. O

Also O
I O
have O
to O
emphasize O
that O
the O
starters B-TARGET
were O
mostly O
cold O
and O
some O
peppers B-TARGET
could O
not O
be O
eaten O
because O
they O
had O
just O
taken O
them O
out O
of O
the O
refrigerator O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
quality O
is O
high, O
but O
these O
errors O
could O
be O
corrected O
so O
that O
the O
satisfaction O
would O
be O
greater O
as O
well O
as O
giving O
a O
greater O
amount O
of O
product. O

Last O
night O
we O
dined O
at O
Casa O
Pelentós O
in O
Sandiniés, O
where O
we O
had O
already O
dined O
on O
another O
occasion O
with O
better O
fortune, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
we O
wanted O
to O
repeat. O

It O
was O
certainly O
disappointing, O
especially O
due O
to O
the O
scarcity O
of O
the O
second B-TARGET
courses I-TARGET
in O
relation O
to O
the O
prices. O

The O
bill B-TARGET
is O
high, O
which O
we O
expected, O
although O
not O
that O
high. O

But O
we O
soon O
found O
out O
why: O
the O
six O
slices O
of O
bread O
were O
priced O
at O
2.40 O
euros; O
and O
I, O
who O
could O
not O
drink O
wine O
as O
I O
had O
to O
go O
home O
through O
many O
bends, O
received O
a O
glass O
pitcher O
of O
tap O
water. O

It O
didn't O
matter O
much O
that O
it O
was O
from O
the O
grigo, O
since O
the O
water O
in O
the O
area O
is O
excellent; O
but O
for O
that O
we O
were O
billed O
2.50 O
euros. O

My O
wife, O
certainly, O
upon O
reviewing O
the O
bill B-TARGET
and O
discovering O
the O
latter, O
was O
quite O
upset, O
as O
we O
considered O
Casa O
Pelentós O
one O
of O
our O
few O
Pyrenean O
refuges O
for O
when O
we O
left O
home, O
since O
we O
live O
very O
close O
by. O

Obviously, O
for O
the O
2.50 O
euros O
charged O
for O
tap B-TARGET
water, I-TARGET
they O
have O
lost O
two O
customers. O

Yesterday O
we O
had O
dinner O
at O
Colette. O

Excellent O
dinner! B-TARGET

It O
had O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
a O
restaurant O
in O
Zaragoza O
had O
surprised O
me O
in O
this O
way: O
Great O
quality O
of O
the O
product, B-TARGET
numerous O
details, B-TARGET
perfect O
cooking B-TARGET
points I-TARGET
in O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes, O
abundant O
portions B-TARGET
and O
a O
high O
price O
but O
adjusted O
to O
the O
quality.The O
service B-TARGET
was O
attentive O
and O
polite O
although O
it O
had O
some O
small O
failure O
(like O
serving O
the O
second O
bottle O
of O
wine O
in O
the O
glasses O
in O
which O
there O
was O
still O
some O
of O
the O
previous O
one)From O
the O
beginning O
a O
good O
variety O
of O
breads O
(pizza, O
green O
olive, O
black O
olive, O
...) O
with O
a O
bowl O
of O
olive O
oil O
with O
mozzarella O
tomato O
and O
basil. O

Some O
appetizers O
offered O
by O
the O
house O
with O
a O
white O
martini O
cocktail O
cooled O
with O
liquid O
nitrogen O
and O
a O
pastilla O
of O
foie O
mi-cuit O
wrapped O
in O
raspberry O
with O
cider O
and O
coconut O
cotton. O

Both O
were O
very O
successful. O

As O
starters O
we O
shared: O
- O
a O
carpaccio B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Kobe I-TARGET
beef, I-TARGET
excellent, O
very O
tasty, O
- O
a O
tempura O
of O
comenillas O
stuffed O
with O
foie O
gras O
and O
artichokes O
- O
a O
whole B-TARGET
tail I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
grilled I-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
coral I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
(very O
tasty, O
although O
a O
little O
overdone) O
Before O
the O
second O
course O
the O
house O
offered O
us O
a O
pincho O
of O
quince O
and O
cheese O
tempura O
presented O
on O
a O
cinnamon O
stick O
on O
fire. O

Very O
original O
presentation B-TARGET
and O
very O
successful O
combination. B-TARGET
The O
seconds O
were O
a O
little O
more O
traditional: O

- O
Sirloin O
steak O
with O
foie O
and O
seasonal O
mushrooms: O
gigantic O
portion O
and O
point O
exactly O
as O
ordered, O
which O
is O
rare. O

- O
Low O
temperature O
shank O
with O
caramelized O
sauce O
and O
truffled O
puree. O

Extraordinary O
flavor B-TARGET
and O
texture. B-TARGET

- O
Monkfish O
with O
couscous O
and O
baby O
squid. O

Great O
monkfish B-TARGET
taco I-TARGET
cooked O
to O
perfection O
and O
very O
tasty. O

- O
Squab. O

Only O
the O
breasts. O

Perhaps O
it O
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
less O
done, O
but O
very O
tasty O
and O
also O
accompanied O
by O
an O
excellent O
puree. B-TARGET

Another O
entertainment O
of O
the O
house O
before O
dessert O
with O
some O
crumbs O
with O
dehydrated O
and O
candied O
strawberries O
with O
vanilla O
soup O
(served O
in O
a O
glass O
of O
dry O
ice O
to O
make O
a O
bubbling O
volcano O
effect). O

Spectacular O
and O
very O
tasty. O

We O
only O
ordered O
two O
desserts B-TARGET
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
they O
were O
the O
weakest O
part O
of O
the O
dinner: O

- O
A O
crispy O
apple O
tart O
with O
vanilla O
ice O
cream O
- O
A O
chocolate O
coulant O
with O
marron O
glacé O
ice O
cream. O

When O
we O
were O
finishing O
our O
coffees, O
they O
brought O
us O
some O
pastries. O

In O
short, O
280 O
€ O
for O
4 O
people O
including O
two O
bottles O
of O
Enate O
Merlot-merlot O
(which O
contributed O
60 O
€ O
to O
the O
bill). O
I O
think O
that O
the O
bill O
was O
not O
disproportionate O
to O
the O
quality O
and O
quantity O
of O
the O
food O
and O
the O
details O
that O
we O
were O
offered. O

A O
good O
place B-TARGET
to O
follow. O

If O
they O
maintain O
the O
level O
of O
innovation O
and O
quality O
it O
can O
be O
a O
breath O
of O
fresh O
air O
in O
Zaragoza. O

P.S. O

From O
what O
I O
read O
in O
previous O
comments O
they O
must O
have O
reduced O
the O
prices, O
because O
yesterday O
the O
tempura O
of O
morels O
and O
foie O
was O
18 O
€ O
and O
not O
the O
22 O
mentioned O
in O
another O
comment. O

If O
so, O
well O
done. O

Very O
good O
description O
Pedro, O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
to O
the O
restaurant O
Colette, O
I O
have O
read O
some O
negative O
and O
some O
positive O
opinions, O
but O
certainly O
from O
what O
you O
say O
its O
cuisine O
is O
highly O
recommended. O

Although O
I O
am O
somewhat O
reticent O
about O
molecular O
cuisine. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
other O
one, O
the O
q-art, O
and O
I O
left O
very O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O
place. O

Is O
there O
a O
separation O
between O
tables? O

Hi O
JoséIn O
Colette O
they O
don't O
have O
a O
non-smoking O
area. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
is O
quite O
a O
small O
place. B-TARGET

The O
tables B-TARGET
are O
large O
and O
the O
space O
between O
them O
is O
quite O
wide. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
quite O
full O
(although O
not O
full) O
and O
yet O
we O
were O
very O
quiet, O
with O
almost O
total O
privacy. O

Although O
there O
were O
smokers O
at O
the O
next O
table O
we O
did O
not O
feel O
any O
discomfort O
during O
the O
meal. O

I O
think O
the O
ventilation B-TARGET
was O
quite O
good, O
although O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
there O
were O
more O
smokers O
or O
more O
compulsive O
smokers. O

As O
for O
the O
"molecular O
cuisine", O
don't O
worry: O
I O
like O
"molecular O
cuisine" O
very O
much, O
but O
Colette's O
is O
not. O
but O
Colette's O
is O
not. O

It's O
a O
fairly O
traditional O
cuisine O
in O
terms O
of O
concepts O
but O
seasoned O
with O
modern O
and O
well-applied O
cooking B-TARGET
procedures, I-TARGET
along O
with O
creative O
presentations. B-TARGET

The O
highlight O
for O
me O
is O
the O
use O
of O
low B-TARGET
temperature I-TARGET
cooking I-TARGET
in O
many O
dishes O
and O
spectacular O
and O
elaborate O
presentations. B-TARGET

Disappointing O
experience. B-TARGET
The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
that O
seems O
complete O
in O
the O
offer, O
in O
the O
international O
section O
nothing O
at O
all O
do O
not O
have O
any O
of O
the O
references. O

In O
the O
rest, O
three O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
were O
out O
of O
stock, O
and O
in O
desperation O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
rioja O
if O
we O
could, O
they O
brought O
us O
a O
Roda B-TARGET
ll I-TARGET
2004, I-TARGET
well, O
the O
wine O
was O
hot, O
in O
short, O
a O
very O
embarrassing O
situation. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
attractive, O
the O
calamari B-TARGET
Andalusian I-TARGET
style O
impossible, O
glass B-TARGET
peppers I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
anchovies, I-TARGET
swimming O
in O
oil O
of O
mediocre O
quality, O
cod B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
leek I-TARGET
cream, I-TARGET
covered O
by O
an O
exaggerated O
let's O
call O
it O
a O
salad O
of O
rucula, O
the O
whole O
dish O
bad, O
shoulder B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
lamb I-TARGET
well O
in O
its O
execution, O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
very O
weak, O
very O
weak. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
cozy O
and O
well O
installed. O

We O
entered O
with O
great O
expectation O
and O
left O
very O
disappointed. O

Good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
cuisine. B-TARGET
But... O
being O
so O
small, O
tobacco B-TARGET
smoke I-TARGET
ruins O
the O
whole O
dinner. O

Unbelievable O
that O
smoking O
is O
allowed O
in O
a O
place O
like O
this. O

Let's O
see O
if O
they O
change O
the O
law O
soon O
and O
we O
can O
taste O
good O
cuisine B-TARGET
without O
stinking O
alterations O
like O
tobacco B-TARGET
.... O

In O
two O
words?-a O
crapIn O
more O
words?expensive, O
tacky, O
looks O
like O
a O
cave, O
minimal O
rations B-TARGET
and O
dishes B-TARGET
of O
the O
most O
normal.the O
only O
thing O
of O
author, O
is O
the O
photo B-TARGET
that O
really O
is O
worthy O
of O
the O
prize O
for O
shame, O
(...). O

A O
shame O
what O
we O
have O
been O
charged, O
have O
suggested O
the O
starters O
and O
we O
have O
been O
charged O
9 O
euros O
per O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomato. I-TARGET
We O
have O
been O
12 O
and O
we O
have O
paid O
700 O
euros O
and O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
to O
be O
invited O
to O
a O
shot. O

A O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
as O
a O
starter O
... O
25 O
euros? O

And O
the O
bread O
that O
we O
have O
not O
asked O
... O
in O
short O
I O
recommend O
to O
all O
that O
you O
do O
not O
step O
on O
this O
site B-TARGET
because O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
just O
to O
enter. O

For O
this O
money O
I O
really O
eat O
in O
a O
proper O
place. O

It O
is O
a O
unique O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza, O
it O
is O
small, O
comfortable O
and O
very O
private, O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
perfect O
as O
it O
makes O
it O
very O
cozy, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
special O
and O
of O
very O
good O
quality. O

It O
is O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
repeat O
my O
note O
is O
9. O

Regarding O
the O
price, O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
with O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
service O
and O
exclusivity O
is O
perfect, O
but O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
with O
other O
restaurants O
of O
this O
class O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
Spain. O

remember O
that O
zaragoza O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
town. O

i O
just O
said O
that O
it O
is O
an O
amazing O
place, B-TARGET
food, O
service O
and O
decoration, O
what O
i O
liked O
the O
most O
was O
the O
food B-TARGET
because O
it O
is O
of O
very O
good O
quality, O
i O
hope O
that O
in O
the O
future O
it O
will O
be O
the O
same O
and O
that O
it O
will O
not O
change. O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
repeat O
and O
recommend. O

The O
price, O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
with O
the O
quality, O
the O
attention O
and O
the O
place, O
is O
at O
the O
height. O

restoration O
in O
Zaragoza. O

Hello O
good O
evening O
I O
am O
Javier O
Milan O
of O
Pantxika O
orio O
restaurant, O
I O
have O
come O
to O
comment O
to O
the O
restaurant O
what O
happened O
with O
Luis, O
I O
really O
do O
not O
know O
what O
they O
have O
written, O
but O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
have O
been O
in O
hospitality O
about O
20 O
years, O
I O
know O
many O
representatives, O
normally O
after O
so O
many O
years O
saves O
the O
foot O
that O
each O
one O
limps O
and O
just O
tell O
you O
one O
thing, O
THIS O
GUY O
DOES O
NOT O
COJEA O
And O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
that O
this O
guy O
will O
never O
make O
a O
bad O
comment O
about O
a O
restaurant O
simply O
for O
three O
things; O
He O
has O
worked O
in O
the O
hotel O
business, O
he O
needs O
all O
the O
restaurants O
to O
continue O
selling, O
third O
and O
most O
important, O
HE O
IS O
A O
VERY O
NOBLE O
GUY O
and O
those O
of O
us O
who O
know O
him O
know O
that O
he O
is O
incapable O
of O
criticizing O
anyone. O

i O
want O
to O
support O
luis O
argente O
and O
fender O
if O
there O
is O
room O
for O
it: O
i O
am O
ernesto O
tejados O
and O
i O
have O
a O
restaurant. O

i O
am O
the O
one O
who O
warned O
luis O
about O
this O
comment O
on O
monday. O

i O
told O
him O
luis O
you O
made O
this O
comment O
about O
the O
restaurant O
vetula, O
and O
he O
didn't O
know O
what O
i O
was O
talking O
about, O
so O
i O
showed O
him O
the O
page O
that O
by O
the O
way O
he O
didn't O
even O
know O
it O
and O
then O
he O
contacted O
me O
to O
solve O
this O
misunderstanding. O

I O
can O
attest O
that O
he O
didn't O
know O
anything O
at O
all. O

Regards. O

ernesto. O

I O
recommend O
this O
place. B-TARGET
I O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
my O
birthday, O
and O
samilos O
delighted, O
we O
will O
repeat O
for O
sure. O

Everything O
in O
small O
quantities O
but O
very O
good, O
very O
well O
cooked, O
and O
perfect O
treatment. B-TARGET

It O
is O
not O
to O
go O
every O
week, O
because O
it O
is O
a O
little O
more O
expensive, O
q O
the O
typical O
casual O
restaurant, O
but O
it O
is O
worth O
it, O
for O
a O
special O
celebration. O

Thank O
you! O

SHAMEFUL!!! O

I O
spoke O
to O
the O
restaurant O
the O
night O
before O
and O
they O
kindly O
explained O
to O
me O
the O
3 O
menus O
they O
had O
for O
midweek. O

I O
chose O
the O
most O
expensive O
one O
and O
made O
a O
reservation. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
not O
bad: O
Iberian O
ham O
with O
bread O
with O
tomato, O
squid O
with O
padron O
peppers, O
potatoes O
confit O
with O
foie O
and O
rice O
with O
mushrooms. O

For O
the O
main O
course O
we O
had O
to O
choose O
between O
several O
dishes O
among O
which O
were O
cod, O
monkfish, O
sirloin O
steak, O
cochillino, O
steak O
tartar,... O
The O
first B-TARGET
ones O
were O
centers O
that O
were O
good O
to O
taste, O
but O
they O
were O
scarce. O

If O
the O
second B-TARGET
course O
would O
have O
been O
a O
good O
dish, O
I O
wouldn't O
say O
a O
word, O
but O
no. O
The O
second O
course O
was O
a O
good O
quality O
dish O
(a O
good O
quality O
one). O

The O
second O
course O
was O
of O
good O
quality O
(but O
not O
exceptional) O
and O
again O
scarce O
(at O
least O
for O
the O
quality/quantity/price O
ratio). O

Dessert... O
2 O
small O
pastries O
from O
any O
pastry O
shop O
per O
person. O

Whether O
they O
are O
their O
own O
or O
not, O
I O
don't O
say O
anything. O

But O
again O
they O
were O
scarce O
(and O
not O
special O
at O
all). O

In O
the O
end O
we O
paid: O
38 O
per O
person, O
10 O
euros O
for O
a O
plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
garden I-TARGET
that O
they O
grow O
(offered O
suddenly O
having O
the O
menu O
closed O
and O
without O
warning O
of O
the O
price), O
2 O
euros O
for O
coffee, B-TARGET
5.5 O
for O
pacharán O
(I O
say O
nothing O
about O
this, O
if O
you O
ask O
for O
it O
you O
pay O
for O
it) O
and O
13 O
euros O
for O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
having O
the O
menu O
closed. O

All O
plus O
vat. O

After O
asking O
me O
about O
this O
'extra-cost' O
for O
the O
wine, O
I O
was O
told O
that O
they O
consider O
that O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
is O
every O
3 O
or O
4, O
so O
when O
I O
order O
3 O
and O
go O
6, O
I O
am O
charged O
1. O

I O
don't O
understand O
how O
they O
do O
with O
the O
couples O
that O
go. O

Summary: O
as O
the O
title O
said: O
scoundrels!!!! O

You O
can't O
be O
so O
sophisticated, O
cheating O
and O
trying O
to O
make O
money O
out O
of O
any O
cluelessness O
of O
the O
diners. O

I O
find O
it O
shameful O
that O
they O
charge O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
because O
being O
6 O
people O
on O
the O
menu O
only O
2 O
correspond. O

Especially O
being O
the O
price O
of O
38 O
euros O
(plus O
vat) O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
being O
rather O
scarce O
and O
without O
providing O
more O
quality O
than O
many O
other O
places O
at O
a O
better O
price. O

Three O
forks? O

HAHAHAHAHA, O
I O
laugh O
at O
the O
forks. O

I O
laugh O
after O
they O
have O
laughed O
at O
my O
pocket. O

AVOID O
IT O
IF O
YOU O
CAN! O

We O
were O
having O
dinner O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
on O
Saturday, O
November O
19, O
and O
I O
must O
say O
that O
the O
place B-TARGET
raises O
many O
expectations, O
which O
are O
then O
disappointed O
by O
the O
food, B-TARGET
normal, O
the O
quantity O
is O
not O
scarce, O
but O
minimal, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
defieciente, O
and O
the O
astronomical O
price. O

In O
short, O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
many O
pretensions O
that O
comes O
to O
nothing. O

I O
DO O
NOT O
RECOMMEND O
IT O
AT O
ALL. O

I O
do O
not O
really O
know O
the O
place O
that O
you O
refer O
almost O
all, O
but O
on O
Saturday O
night O
January O
21, O
2012, O
we O
were O
having O
dinner O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
(8 O
pax.) O

and O
we O
had O
a O
wonderful O
dinner, O
both O
in O
quality O
and O
quantity. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
also O
at O
the O
height. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
cozy; O
it O
was O
all O
excellent, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
those O
people O
who O
want O
to O
enjoy O
elegance. O

Great O
dinner B-TARGET
on O
Saturday O
night O
with O
a O
Groupalia O
voucher. O

Excellent O
quality O
and O
price. O

Today O
and O
tomorrow O
is O
still O
the O
offer, O
but O
if O
anyone O
wants O
to O
buy O
it.40 O
€ O
for O
a O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
with O
good O
product, O
very O
well O
cooked O
and O
including O
gin O
and O
tonic, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
unbeatable.yes, O
for O
my O
taste O
the O
gin O
and O
tonic O
better O
without O
violet, O
although O
I O
am O
a O
lover O
of O
violet O
candy, O
better O
everything O
in O
its O
place. O

Saturday O
night, O
I O
make O
a O
reservation O
for O
4 O
people O
at O
the O
Colette, O
and O
when O
we O
arrive O
not O
only O
do O
we O
not O
have O
a O
reservation O
but O
the O
Colette, O
supposedly O
of O
higher O
quality O
than O
the O
Quartz, O
no O
longer O
exists O
as O
such, O
they O
tell O
us O
that O
they O
have O
merged, O
they O
are O
the O
same O
restaurant O
and O
they O
look O
for O
a O
table O
for O
us O
in O
the O
latter. O

Without O
offering O
us O
the O
menu, O
they O
give O
us O
the O
menu O
of O
dishes, O
I O
guess O
to O
see O
if O
it O
fits, O
until O
we O
ask O
for O
the O
menus, O
then O
they O
explain O
the O
excellence O
of O
their O
menus, O
which O
is O
not O
of O
bad O
quality O
although O
we O
ask O
for O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
from O
the O
menu, O
since O
you O
can O
not O
choose O
color, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
does O
not O
seem O
to O
us O
according O
to O
the O
supposed O
quality O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
narrow O
and O
elongated O
so O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
communicate O
without O
shouting O
if O
it O
is O
full, O
as O
is O
the O
case. O

It O
seems O
excessive O
to O
me O
the O
valuation O
on O
this O
website, O
without O
the O
intention O
of O
discouraging O
the O
restaurant, O
knowing O
what O
they O
offer. O

Unique O
in O
Zaragoza, O
it O
was O
about O
time. O

Excellent O
facilities, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
unbeatable O
cuisine B-TARGET
... O
worth O
a O
try. O

I O
recommend O
it! O

One O
Sunday O
at O
noon O
I O
paid O
the O
hazing O
of O
eating O
there, O
but O
one O
and O
no O
more. O

It O
is O
6 O
months O
old, O
we O
were O
in O
the O
whole O
restaurant O
about O
13 O
people O
and O
three O
waitresses O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
WAS O
PENALTY O
much O
white O
glove O
put O
but O
they O
leave O
you O
the O
same O
cutlery O
from O
starters O
to O
desserts, O
the O
dishes O
pile O
up O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
table O
and O
do O
not O
take O
them O
away, O
it O
needs O
bread O
and O
you O
have O
to O
almost O
beg O
for O
it. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
scarce O
for O
what O
they O
charge O
you, O
for O
example O
a O
plate B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
three I-TARGET
morels I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
foi I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
three I-TARGET
artichoke I-TARGET
hearts I-TARGET
battered I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
tempura I-TARGET
cost O
22 O
euros O
and O
the O
sirloin B-TARGET
barely O
reaches O
60 O
grams. O

The O
food O
is O
very O
good, O
but O
if O
you O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
cutlery, O
either O
you O
tell O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
if O
you O
catch O
her, O
or O
you O
clean O
it O
yourself. O

I O
DO O
NOT O
RECOMMEND O
IT O

I O
have O
been O
in O
several O
occasions O
realizing O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
and O
then O
we O
have O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant.the O
food B-TARGET
appeared O
to O
us O
good O
to O
the O
people O
that O
we O
have O
been O
eating, O
that O
if O
we O
have O
never O
eaten O
the O
menu, O
whenever O
we O
have O
eaten O
we O
have O
let O
us O
advise O
by O
the O
person O
who O
has O
attended O
to O
us O
in O
the O
table, O
normally O
we O
have O
shared O
some O
entrants O
and O
then O
each O
one O
to O
choose O
what O
he O
wished.the O
certain O
thing O
is O
that O
very O
well. O

We O
also O
spent O
a O
couple O
of O
nights O
at O
the O
Spa O
with O
circuit O
and O
full O
board O
and O
certainly O
the O
menus B-TARGET
left O
something O
to O
be O
desired. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
guests O
have O
NO O
wine, O
you O
can O
ask O
for O
it O
but O
with O
the O
corresponding O
charge O
to O
the O
room. O

A O
pity O
for O
such O
excellent O
facilities. O

I O
go O
a O
lot O
to O
the O
Balneario O
Paracuellos O
de O
Jiloca, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
they O
give O
me O
is O
always O
STUPENDOUS, O
they O
give O
you O
a O
lot O
of O
quantity O
and O
also O
with O
quality. O

I O
RECOMMEND O
IT O
TO O
EVERYONE. O

Yesterday O
I O
was O
in O
the O
Spa O
doing O
a O
seaweed O
wrap O
and O
a O
thermal O
circuit. O

I O
left O
fascinated, O
in O
the O
morning O
I O
did O
the O
wrap, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
while O
in O
the O
gym. O

We O
ate O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
of O
the O
spa O
that O
by O
the O
way O
is O
to O
congratulate O
the O
food, B-TARGET
how O
well O
we O
ate. O

In O
the O
afternoon O
we O
made O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
that O
was O
phenomenal O
all O
afternoon O
bathing. O

Only O
one O
thing O
is O
missing O
that O
in O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
they O
have O
water O
to O
drink O
if O
you O
are O
thirsty. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
Hotel O
Balneario O
Paracuellos O
de O
Jiloca, O
doing O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
in O
the O
morning O
by O
the O
way O
I O
loved O
!!!!, O

we O
also O
ate O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
STUPENDOUS, O
they O
give O
you O
a O
choice O
and O
the O
food O
is O
great!!!!! O

In O
the O
afternoon O
we O
did O
treatments O
and O
massages O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
outdoor O
pool O
and O
solarium. O

A O
MARVEL, O
I O
RECOMMEND O
IT O
TO O
YOU O
!!!!! O

Hello, O
I O
was O
at O
the O
Hotel O
Balneario O
Paracuellos O
de O
Jiloca, O
spending O
a O
few O
days O
and O
I O
really O
liked O
it O
a O
lot. O

The O
attention O
of O
all O
the O
reception O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
dining O
room, O
the O
spa O
is O
buenisima O
make O
you O
feel O
very O
comfortable O
and O
at O
home. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
plentiful O
and O
the O
day O
before O
you O
can O
choose O
what O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
the O
next O
day, O
we O
liked O
everything O
and O
will O
be O
back O
soon! O

1/02/2012 O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
people O
can O
complain O
about O
the O
food O
at O
the O
spa O
restaurant, O
we O
were O
9 O
days O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
varied, O
very O
abundant O
and O
delicious. O

The O
attention O
of O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
was O
exceptional, O
we O
will O
return O
if O
only O
for O
the O
attention O
received, O
thanks O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
for O
your O
attention. O

It O
is O
an O
appreciation, O
but O
the O
rabbit B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
garlic, I-TARGET
is O
cooked O
just O
like O
that, O
with O
the O
oil O
of O
having O
cooked O
it, O
which O
carries O
all O
the O
flavor. O

It O
is O
not O
that O
it O
swims O
in O
oil, O
it O
is O
that O
they O
throw O
it O
to O
him O
so O
that O
it O
does O
not O
remain O
dry O
and O
you O
can O
wet. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
you O
don't O
like O
it. O

It O
is O
the O
spa O
where O
we O
have O
eaten O
worse O
than O
any O
other O
I O
know, O
poorly O
prepared, O
little O
variety, B-TARGET
not O
even O
the O
breakfasts B-TARGET
are O
appetizing. O

The O
spa O
as O
such O
is O
very O
well, O
for O
that O
there O
is O
no O
complaint. O

Excellent O
the O
thermal O
circuit. O

As O
for O
the O
food, B-TARGET
sincerely O
it O
is O
not O
bad. O

They O
are O
not O
bombastic O
dishes B-TARGET
(several O
people O
have O
already O
told O
me O
that O
the O
food O
of O
Alhama O
de O
Aragón O
is O
better), O
but O
they O
are O
easy O
to O
eat O
and O
they O
were O
good. O

I O
remember O
that O
I O
ordered O
chipirones B-TARGET
guisados I-TARGET
and O
they O
were O
very O
good, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
seafood B-TARGET
puree I-TARGET
that O
was O
delicious. O

Even O
if O
the O
rest O
was O
more O
or O
less O
normal O
(the O
spa B-TARGET
hors I-TARGET
d'oeuvres I-TARGET
are O
the O
same O
as O
those O
shown O
in O
the O
photo), O
they O
were O
good O
enough O
to O
eat. O

It O
may O
not O
be O
to O
enter O
into O
select O
palates, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
bad. O

Of O
course O
I O
expected O
it O
to O
be O
worse O
from O
the O
comments, O
but O
fortunately O
it O
was O
not. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
correct, O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
slow, O
maybe O
it O
was O
very O
busy. O

Food, O
correct O
starters B-TARGET
except O
for O
the O
skewers, B-TARGET
the O
rice B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crayfish I-TARGET
was O
good. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
professional O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
quality O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
a O
better O
quality/price O
ratio. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
below O
the O
above, O
but B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
whole I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
good I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
highly I-TARGET
recommended. I-TARGET

A O
more O
than O
correct O
service B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

I O
would O
repeat O
the O
restaurant O
when O
celebrating O
another O
group O
dinner. O

Good O
tasting B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
as O
well O
as O
the O
service. B-TARGET

I O
will O
repeat. O

Last O
Saturday O
we O
had O
dinner O
with O
some O
friends, O
we O
were O
invited O
to O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
plentiful, O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money O
and O
the O
dining B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
was O
very O
nice O
as O
well O
as O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
bad. O

We O
had O
a O
group B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
super O
scarce O
with O
a O
ration B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
that O
was O
laughable O
to O
see O
it. O

We O
had O
only O
one O
bottle O
of O
wine O
for O
each O
6 O
and O
were O
charged O
for O
the O
others. O

The O
sirloin B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
must O
have O
been O
a O
great-grandfather's O
because O
it O
was O
very O
bad. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

Although O
when O
I O
got O
home O
I O
realized O
that O
they O
did O
not O
give O
me O
the O
10% O
discount O
that O
the O
reservation O
said. O

I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
service O
and O
the O
food O
was O
very O
good, O
but O
when O
I O
got O
home O
I O
realized O
that O
they O
didn't O
apply O
the O
10% O
discount O
that O
the O
reservation O
said. O

Lousy. O

The O
treatment O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
towards O
the O
customers O
was O
pretty O
bad: O
edges, O
bad O
faces, O
etc... O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
terrible O
and O
to O
top O
it O
off O
the O
price. O

It O
is O
expensive O
and O
the O
food O
is O
bad O

I O
was O
there O
last O
Friday O
night, O
it O
was O
incredible, O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters O
was O
impeccable O
and O
very O
nice, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
very O
recommendable O
and O
very O
cozy O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

really O
has O
been O
a O
real O
find, O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Barcelona, O
a O
place O
where O
you O
eat O
good O
menu B-TARGET
both O
on O
weekdays O
and O
on O
holidays. O

San O
Jordi O
has O
been O
the O
test O
with O
the O
whole O
family, O
and O
came O
out O
round, O
a O
good O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
price O
and O

good O
service B-TARGET
excellent O
menu B-TARGET

Dinner O
for O
two O
with O
a O
very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
we O
found O
a O
quiet O
and O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food, O
in O
our O
case O
a O
xato B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
to O
share O
and O
a O
duck B-TARGET
breast, I-TARGET
excellent! O

I O
recommend O
it, O
we O
will O
come O
back. O

We O
went O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
choosing O
dishes O
a O
la O
carte, O
but O
we O
were O
presented O
with O
a O
very O
correct O
menu B-TARGET
at O
a O
reasonable O
price, O
so O
that O
was O
our O
choice. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
very O
correct O
in O
presentation, O
quantity O
and O
flavors. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
attention O
were O
very O
good. O

We O
will O
return O

The O
service O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
if O
you O
make O
a O
reservation, O
you O
should O
not O
set O
up O
a O
separate O
table O
if O
you O
have O
noticed O
that O
the O
dining O
room O
is O
full, O
otherwise O
why O
make O
a O
reservation? O

The O
ration B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
short O
for O
what O
is O
charged O
per O
plate, B-TARGET
but O
well O
prepared. O

Very O
good O
treatment, B-TARGET
very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
an O
ideal O
place O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
quality O
menu. B-TARGET

As O
always O
they O
have O
been O
at O
the O
height, O
perfect O
quality O
price O
and O
unbeatable O
service, B-TARGET
extremely O
friendly. O

Very O
convenient O
location B-TARGET
to O
move O
with O
public O
transport, O
metro O
and O
bus O
next O
door. O

The O
customer O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
correct O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
the O
price. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
the O
rest O
is O
terrible; O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
dirt, O
it's O
not O
comfortable, O
the O
toilets B-TARGET
are O
very O
dirty, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
super O
late, O
and O
the O
kitchen O
is O
terrible, O
food B-TARGET
without O
texture, O
very O
industrial, O
like O
a O
daily O
menu, O
at O
10.0 O
€. O

The O
opinions O
I O
read, O
before O
going, O
totally O
confused O
me. O

<->We O
ordered O
a O
la O
carte O
(not O
menú O
del O
día) O
paella B-TARGET
as O
a O
main O
course O
- O
almost O
burnt, O
overcooked O
rice. O

<-> O
Shrimp B-TARGET
parched O
and O
we O
don't O
know O
why, O
but O
they O
filled O
it O
with O
chunks O
of O
that O
" O
stick-shaped B-TARGET
but I-TARGET
shrimp-flavored I-TARGET
substitute I-TARGET
" O
that O
was O
almost O
rubbery-impossible O
to O
eat. O

<->We O
couldn't O
even O
eat O
half O
of O
the O
paella. B-TARGET

<+> O
Friendly B-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

<+> O
Passable O
starters B-TARGET
-normal O
in O
taste. O

Very O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
all O
fantastic. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
for O
sure. O

Good O
overall, O
a O
little O
slow O
service. B-TARGET

Good. O

Diligent O
service B-TARGET
with O
willingness O
to O
comply. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
could O
be O
improved, O
next O
to O
excellent O
dishes O
such O
as O
cod, B-TARGET
others O
not O
so O
much O
as O
the O
tuna, B-TARGET
too O
much O
done, O
they O
correctly O
applied O
the O
promotional B-TARGET
discount. I-TARGET

Excellent O
cuisine, B-TARGET
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
were O
exquisite. O

Nice O
restaurant, B-TARGET
good O
ambience O
and O
service. B-TARGET

The O
tables B-TARGET
were O
extremely O
close O
together O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
tasteless. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

Entrance B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
messy, O
with O
paper O
on O
the O
floor, O
vibration O
of O
the O
subway O
and O
annoying O
room O
noise. O

If O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
tasty, O
the O
rest O
would O
be O
the O
same. O

Excellent O
location B-TARGET
and O
lighting. B-TARGET

Perfect O
value O
for O
money, O
very O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
food. B-TARGET

Totally O
recommendable. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice O
and O
attentive, O
the O
starters B-TARGET
are O
very O
good. O

The O
paella B-TARGET
was O
good O
for O
the O
price. O

Everything O
was O
very O
good. O

JR O

They O
didn't O
answer O
me O
and O
as O
I O
had O
to O
leave, O
I O
told O
them, O
I O
sent O
a O
second O
email, O
telling O
them O
to O
call O
me O
back. O

They O
didn't. O

I O
guess O
because O
it O
was O
late O
and O
it O
was O
St. O
Jordi's O
day O
they O
couldn't O
answer. O

But O
the O
experience O
helped O
me O
to O
get O
to O
know O
the O
restaurants. O

Excellent O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
goes O
from O
less O
to O
more O
with O
two O
really O
good O
final B-TARGET
courses. O

The O
restaurant O
"La O
Cullera O
de O
Boix" O
is O
excellent O
both O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
service, B-TARGET
we O
had O
no O
problems. O

The O
toilets B-TARGET
are O
in O
a O
sorry O
state, O
and O
the O
tablecloths, B-TARGET
glasses, B-TARGET
etc., O
could O
improve O
the O
cleanliness. O

The O
tablecloths, O
glasses, O
etc. O
can O
improve O
the O
cleanliness. B-TARGET

As O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
staff O
can O
say O
that O
this O
was O
very O
correct. O

Friendly O
staff B-TARGET
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
weak. O

Without O
any O
grace, O
not O
very O
tasty O
rice. B-TARGET

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
it! O

In O
these O
times O
we O
are O
all O
going O
for O
discounts O
without O
sacrificing O
quality, O
this O
restaurant O
gave O
the O
size O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
we O
chose, O
by O
the O
way, O
all O
very O
good, O
the O
quantities O
very O
successful, O
the O
rice B-TARGET
broth I-TARGET
we O
liked O
quite O
a O
lot. O

The O
attention O
of O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
was O
cozy. O

We O
will O
return. O

<->Nothing O

<+>The O
attention B-TARGET

We O
are O
very O
happy. O

We O
were O
21 O
people, O
exceptional O
treatment, B-TARGET
the O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
good. O

The O
only O
drawback O
was O
the O
space, B-TARGET
we O
could O
hardly O
move. O

Otherwise O
very O
well. O

Magnificent O
attention, B-TARGET
good O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
very O
good O
paella. B-TARGET

We O
will O
repeat. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
we O
chose O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
complete. O

The O
only O
thing O
was O
that O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
bring O
the O
food, O
we O
waited O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
menu O
was O
closed O
beforehand. O

Really O
a O
big O
disappointment, O
lousy O
service, B-TARGET
plus O
not O
only O
the O
drink B-TARGET
is O
not O
included O
but O
they O
do O
not O
even O
put O
bread O
or O
water. O

Great O
rice B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
treatment. B-TARGET

It O
is O
the O
second O
time O
we O
go O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
first O
time O
we O
had O
a O
bad O
experience B-TARGET
due O
to O
a O
misunderstanding O
but O
this O
last O
time O
everything O
went O
well. O

They O
served O
us O
wonderfully O
and O
after O
dinner O
they O
gave O
us O
a O
wooden O
spoon O
each. O

We O
celebrated O
our O
Silver O
Jubilee O
in O
this O
restaurant O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
everything O
was O
perfect, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
I O
would O
highlight O
the O
croquettes B-TARGET
of O
the O
appetizer O
(delicious) O
and O
of O
course, O
the O
paella. B-TARGET

To O
put O
a O
but, O
perhaps O
the O
ham B-TARGET
was O
not O
all O
the O
"Iberian" O
that O
could O
be O
expected. O

It O
is O
a O
highly O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Quiet O
place, B-TARGET
correct O
portions, B-TARGET
the O
best O
rice O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
the O
price. O

The O
place O
has O
a O
very O
pleasant O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
exquisite. O

The O
treatment O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
varied O
with O
a O
very O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
pleasant O
treatment O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
with O
a O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

Everything O
was O
great. O

We O
can O
not O
give O
a O
single O
complaint O
because O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
we O
entered O
until O
our O
departure O
everything O
was O
great. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
exquisite, O
abundant, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
very O
pleasant. O

For O
a O
gastronomic O
menu, O
if O
the O
food O
is O
only O
good, O
not O
to O
say O
discreet O
(as O
far O
as O
paella B-TARGET
as O
a O
main O
dish O
is O
concerned) O
the O
result O
was O
somewhat O
disappointing, O
although O
the O
price O
could O
be O
considered O
exceptional. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
better O
with O
a O
better O
treatment, O
a O
more O
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
a O
more O
comfortable O
table. B-TARGET

For O
example: O
paella, O
before O
plating, O
it O
costs O
so O
much O
to O
show O
it? O

These O
are O
details O
that O
make O
you O
lose O
valuation O
.... O

I O
expected O
a O
little O
more O
rice, B-TARGET
otherwise, O
everything O
was O
very O
correct. O

A O
great O
menu, B-TARGET
very O
complete. O

The O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
very O
friendly, O
the O
rice B-TARGET
was O
exquisite O
and O
at O
half O
the O
price, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Only O
for O
emergencies, O
not O
recommended. O

Correct O
restaurant B-TARGET
without O
more O
pretensions, O
abundant O
food B-TARGET
but O
without O
an O
extraordinary O
quality. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
lousy, O
slow O
and O
did O
not O
know O
anything. O

The O
rice B-TARGET
did O
not O
surprise O
me O
either. O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
will O
repeat. O

We O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
for O
a O
company O
Christmas O
dinner O
and O
the O
quality-price O
ratio O
surprised O
us. O

Very O
good O
menu B-TARGET
and O
abundant O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
diligent O
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
(we O
were O
in O
the O
private O
room) O
pleasant. O

We O
had O
a O
working O
dinner O
and O
were O
very O
well O
attended, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
we O
have O
eaten O
on O
a O
day O
like O
this O
when O
the O
restaurants O
are O
full O
of O
groups. O

Neither O
the O
quality O
nor O
the O
presentation O
was O
inferior. O

Although O
there O
were O
several O
groups O
we O
did O
not O
suffer O
from O
the O
noise O
and O
we O
were O
able O
to O
talk O
without O
shouting. O

The B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
was I-TARGET
very O
good O
and O
in O
good O
quantity. O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
people O
who O
gave O
their O
opinion, O
who O
are O
friends O
or O
relatives? O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
entered O
the O
restaurant O
there O
was O
an O
impressive O
smell B-TARGET
of O
unclean O
kitchen, O
then O
some O
very O
scary O
starters. O

of O
fear, O
razor O
clams B-TARGET
with O
earth, O
musclos B-TARGET
with O
flavor O
to O
"I O
do O
not O
know", O
squids B-TARGET
that O
seemed O
tortillitas, O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
little O
cold, O
Iberian B-TARGET
ham O
qualification O
5 O
justito O
and O
finally O
the O
paella B-TARGET
very O
good O
the O
truth, O
then O
to O
finish O
the O
task O
the O
dirty O
toilets, B-TARGET
in O
the O
renfe O
I O
believe O
that O
they O
are O
cleaner, O
then O
nothing O
more O
"very O
happy", O
we O
will O
not O
return O
but. O

Very O
good. O

Pica B-TARGET
pica I-TARGET
and O
wine B-TARGET
very O
good. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
they O
took O
us O
into O
account. O

The O
table O
was O
set O
apart, O
so O
it O
was O
intimate. O

Correct O
service B-TARGET
and O
quality. O

Excellent O
rice O
dishes. B-TARGET

All O
very O
good O

We O
were O
in O
this O
restaurant O
on O
New O
Year's O
Eve O
and O
everything O
was O
very O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
was O
pleasant. O

The O
correct O
service, B-TARGET
pleasant O
treatment, O
the O
price O
too. O

The O
rice O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
spectacular, O
very O
good. O

We O
prepared O
a O
dinner O
for O
Christmas O
Day O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
was O
not O
easy O
to O
find O
an O
open O
restaurant O
until O
I O
found O
this O
page. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
centrally O
located, O
good O
prices O
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

We O
were O
a O
group O
of O
11 O
and O
they O
prepared O
us O
a O
table O
a O
little O
apart O
and O
the O
cake B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

It O
is O
worth O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
for O
32.50 O
euros O
has O
an O
excellent O
quality. O

The O
tapas B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
varied O
and O
correctly O
priced. O

To O
put O
a O
flaw O
for O
the O
short O
time O
it O
has O
been O
going O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
attracted O
by O
the O
design O
of O
the O
place O
and O
the O
fame O
that O
is O
taking O
its O
cuisine. O

I O
went O
there O
on O
Friday O
to O
get O
to O
know O
it, O
I O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
design O
of O
the O
place, B-TARGET
not O
to O
mention O
the O
menu B-TARGET
they O
have, O
I O
tried O
among O
other O
things O
an O
egg B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
65 I-TARGET
degrees I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
land I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chistorra I-TARGET
that O
was O
to O
fall O
to O
the O
ground. O

The O
prices O
are O
incredibly O
reasonable. O

It O
is O
certainly O
worth O
it. O

Local B-TARGET
decorated O
very O
modern O
and O
elegant. O

The O
terrace B-TARGET
with O
director O
chairs O
in O
the O
same O
line O
of O
elegance. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
very O
good O
and O
the O
price O
even O
better. O

Highly O
recommended. O

On O
Saturday O
01-11-14, O
we O
were O
having O
dinner O
my O
partner O
and O
I, O
and O
another O
couple, O
and O
we O
all O
left O
delighted, O
I O
had O
only O
visited O
this O
place O
for O
a O
tapa, O
and O
as O
I O
have O
seen O
that O
people O
spoke O
well O
of O
the O
menu, O
we O
tried O
it O
and O
indeed O
it O
was O
a O
total O
success, O
I O
had O
not O
found O
a O
place O
with O
so O
much O
kindness O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end, O
As O
far O
as O
I O
can O
speak, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
we O
chose O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
and O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
the O
time B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
was O
correct, O
they O
did O
not O
take O
long O
at O
all, O
also O
within O
the O
menu O
everything O
included O
water, O
wine, O
coffees O
and O
even O
shots, O
I O
really O
plan O
to O
return, O
and O
I O
plan O
to O
try O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
menu, O
to O
see O
if O
everything O
is O
as O
good O
as O
the O
menu B-TARGET
we O
took. O

I O
invite O
people O
to O
try O
it O
and O
give O
their O
opinion, O
as O
it O
is O
also O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
cozy O
place. B-TARGET

If O
they O
continue O
like O
this O
I O
think O
they O
can O
have O
a O
good O
future. O

I O
love O
the O
place, B-TARGET
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
great, O
although O
I O
would O
highlight O
the O
egg B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
65 I-TARGET
degrees I-TARGET
and O
the O
tuna O
sashimi B-TARGET
that O
is O
to O
freak O
out O
and O
a O
torrija B-TARGET
that O
makes O
you O
want O
to O
repeat, O
I O
was O
there O
last O
Wednesday O
with O
some O
friends O
and O
we O
have O
clear O
that O
we O
will O
return, O
ah! O

by O
the O
way O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O

very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
quite O
short O
of O
quantity, O
you O
need O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
dish O
more O
and O
that O
raises O
the O
price, O
as O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
very O
fair. O

Very O
good. O

Great O
dinner, B-TARGET
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

The O
menu B-TARGET
has O
very O
appetizing O
dishes, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
decide O
and O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
is O
correct. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
serve O
us O
and O
that O
small O
details O
such O
as O
a O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
are O
missing. O

Some O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
did O
not O
have O
the O
quality O
we O
expected O
(like O
the O
braised B-TARGET
octopus) I-TARGET
and O
we O
could O
not O
try O
the O
tuna O
because O
they O
had O
run O
out O
of O
it. O

The O
price O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
high O
but O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

We O
really O
liked O
the O
place, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
We O
took O
the O
menu B-TARGET
desgustacion I-TARGET
and O
it O
is O
worth O
it, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
not O
generous O
but O
you O
do O
not O
go O
hungry, O
only O
one O
drawback: O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
warmHighly O
recommended O
for O
those O
looking O
for O
quality O
and O
not O
quantityAlso O
no O
surprises O
that O
if O
I O
charge O
you O
more O
for O
ordering O
another O
bottle O
of O
wine O
or O
bread......Also O
coffee O
and O
shot O
included O
in O
the O
34 O
€ O
/ O
person O

I O
was O
having O
dinner O
last O
night, O
I O
was O
looking O
forward O
to O
try O
it, O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
in O
fact O
we O
congratulate O
the O
cook B-TARGET
(I O
think O
his O
name O
was O
Cesar). O

The O
problem O
may O
have O
been O
that O
instead O
of O
ordering O
the O
tasting O
menu O
we O
ordered O
from O
the O
menu, O
and O
honestly, O
it O
seemed O
a O
bit O
expensive O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
portions, O
namely O
a O
grilled O
octopus O
with O
prawns, O
a O
red O
tuna O
with O
teriyaki O
and O
seaweed, O
a O
steak O
tartare, O
a O
ferrero O
rocher O
ice O
cream, O
the O
torrija O
with O
ice O
cream, O
two O
waters, O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
a O
beer O
53 O
euros O
in O
total. O

My O
companion O
had O
already O
had O
dinner O
and O
just O
pecked O
at O
my O
dishes O
to O
try O
them, O
that O
is, O
except O
for O
dessert O
and O
drinks, O
I O
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
had O
dinner. O

And O
while O
I O
repeat O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
even O
above O
the O
average O
of O
what O
is O
eaten O
in O
many O
places, O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
quantity O
of O
the O
portions B-TARGET
was O
just O
right. O

Some O
may O
rightly O
say O
that O
53 O
euros O
for O
five O
courses O
is O
not O
expensive O
if O
they O
are O
good, O
but O
nowadays O
the O
restaurant O
business O
has O
changed O
a O
lot, O
and O
you O
can O
eat O
very O
well O
for O
more O
affordable O
prices O
in O
other O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city, O
including O
some O
of O
those O
mentioned O
by O
Mr. O
Aranda O
in O
this O
blog. O

I O
insist O
that O
in O
reality O
the O
dinner O
was O
for O
one O
person, O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
wine. O

Next O
time O
I O
will O
order O
the O
tasting O
menu, O
and O
I O
suppose O
it O
will O
be O
much O
cheaper, O
and O
will O
improve O
the O
quality-price O
ratio. O

In O
any O
case O
an O
interesting O
place B-TARGET
to O
dine, O
in O
particular O
the O
octopus B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
prawns, I-TARGET
delicious. O

We O
ordered O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
everything O
was O
really O
good. O

The O
truffled B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
cannelloni, O
excellent, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
egg B-TARGET
and O
dessert. B-TARGET

We O
will O
return O
without O
hesitation. O

We O
were O
walking O
down O
the O
street O
and O
entered O
Dobleuno O
simply O
because O
we O
wanted O
to O
have O
some O
tapas. O

We O
did O
not O
know O
it O
and O
did O
not O
expect O
anything O
special. O

The O
surprise O
was O
tremendous O
when O
we O
tried O
the O
first O
tapa O
and O
followed O
with O
the O
others. O

Good O
quality O
and O
reasonable O
price. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
the O
next O
day O
we O
went O
for O
dinner. O

We O
ordered O
spinach O
salad, O
mushroom O
risotto O
and O
octopus O
with O
prawns. O

Incredible. O

It O
is O
not O
common O
to O
find O
so O
much O
quality O
nowadays O
and O
that O
is O
appreciated. O

The O
only O
"but" O
is O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
between O
courses, O
but O
I O
understand O
that O
it O
is O
not O
excessive O
if O
we O
take O
into O
account O
that O
the O
dishes O
are O
very O
elaborate O
and O
are O
made O
on O
the O
spot. O

Well O
I O
disagree O
with O
the O
previous O
caller O
I O
usually O
eat O
a O
lot O
at O
the O
Frances O
and O
although O
it O
is O
true O
that O
the O
quality O
has O
dropped O
somewhat O
the O
food O
is O
still O
good, O
plentiful O
and O
in O
a O
cozy O
place B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
it O
because O
despite O
everything O
you O
still O
eat O
well O
it O
is O
true O
that O
you O
miss O
Jose O
the O
owner, O
now O
are O
the O
children O
and O
always O
loses O
something O
to O
pass O
from O
one O
generation O
to O
another. O

Greetings O

Thank O
goodness O
that O
for O
once O
I O
can O
read O
an O
accurate O
review. O
congratulations O
Mr. B-TARGET
Aranda. I-TARGET

Different, O
creative O
and O
pleasant O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
surprising O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
impeccable. O

We O
will O
come O
back. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
experience. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
superb. O

Excellent O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food, B-TARGET
highly O
recommended. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
slow. O

Good O
will O
but O
excess O
of O
ingredients B-TARGET
to O
merge, O
nothing O
sublime O
or O
surprising, O
kindness B-TARGET
a O
long O
way O
ahead, O
not O
to O
repeat, O
to O
emphasize O
that O
as O
we O
did O
not O
like O
the O
wine O
we O
chose O
we O
changed O
it O
at O
no O
cost. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
comment O
to O
the O
restaurant O
what O
I O
want O
to O
do, O
but O
an O
appreciation O
to O
your O
comment. O

You O
say O
that O
for O
that O
price O
you O
have O
to O
eat O
well. O

I O
think O
that O
in O
any O
place O
that O
serves O
food O
you O
have O
to O
eat O
well O
no O
matter O
what O
they O
charge O
you, O
or O
is O
it O
that O
with O
a O
cheap O
price O
you O
can O
justify O
that O
they O
serve O
you O
something O
inedible? O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
scam. O

If O
they O
serve O
potato O
omelette O
it O
has O
to O
be O
good O
whether O
they O
charge O
you O
2 O
euros O
or O
100, O
the O
price O
increase O
will O
be O
due O
to O
other O
factors O
such O
as O
professionalism, O
number O
of O
tables O
per O
waiter, O
decoration O
of O
the O
place O
and O
other O
factors O
external O
to O
the O
food O
itself. O

Best O
regards, O
and O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
criticism. O

Yes O
Manolo, O
you O
are O
right, O
I O
have O
not O
explained O
myself O
well, O
I O
meant O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
low O
price O
to O
be O
able O
to O
consider O
everything O
as O
"good", O
that O
you O
have O
to O
demand O
a O
little O
more. O

Best O
regards. O

Hello, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
inform O
you O
that O
you O
can O
now O
remove O
it O
from O
the O
list, O
as O
it O
has O
been O
closed O
for O
a O
month. O

A O
pity O

The O
best O
thing O
the O
ham O
instead O
of O
sidreria O
would O
put O
jamoneria, O
in O
mivida O
take O
better O
jamonun O
saludo O

Both O
for O
pleasure O
and O
for O
work, O
I O
have O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
a O
few O
times. O

It O
stands O
out O
in O
everything O
it O
offers O
and O
does O
it O
in O
an O
outstanding O
way O
with O
meat B-TARGET
and O
fish. B-TARGET

Absolutely O
recommendable. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
professional O
restaurants B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza. O

I O
have O
visited O
it O
on O
several O
occasions O
and O
I O
have O
to O
highlight O
the O
excellent O
quality O
of O
the O
raw O
material B-TARGET
and O
the O
know-how O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

You O
can O
find O
from O
a O
well-worked O
steak, B-TARGET
through O
fish B-TARGET
at O
the O
right O
point O
or O
go O
to O
more O
elaborate O
menus, B-TARGET
full O
of O
flavor O
and O
contrasts O
without O
adulterations O
in O
the O
taste. O

Fantastic O
value O
for O
money. O

Absolutely O
recommendable. O

Mireya O

I O
booked O
and O
was O
eating O
with O
a O
good O
friend. O

We O
let O
ourselves O
be O
guided O
and O
they O
offered O
us O
some O
cod O
fritters O
with O
quince O
aioli O
and O
grilled O
squid O
as O
starters O
to O
share. O

The O
main O
courses O
were O
"fideus O
rossejats" O
and O
a O
trunk O
of O
hake O
"a O
la O
donostiarra"; O
for O
dessert O
the O
famous O
"tiramisu" O
of O
the O
house O
and O
a O
caramelized O
apple O
tart O
with O
vanilla O
ice O
cream. O

Everything O
was O
excellent. O

I O
asked O
the O
head O
of O
the O
dining O
room O
to O
ask O
the O
chef O
to O
add O
more O
chili O
pepper O
to O
the O
garlic O
dressing O
of O
the O
hake. O

He O
did O
so O
and O
the O
result O
was O
spectacular. O

To O
drink: O
a O
wine O
recommended O
by O
the O
house, O
Viña O
Salceda O
Reserva O
2010 O
D.O.C. O
Rioja O
(divine O
and O
from O
a O
vintage O
of O
Rioja). O

Rioja B-TARGET
(divine O
and O
from O
an O
"excellent" O
vintage). O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
secure O
values O
of O
Catalan O
cuisine O
in O
Barcelona. O

It O
is O
always O
excellent O
in O
its O
food B-TARGET
and O
perfect O
in O
its O
service. B-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
also O
wonderful. O

You O
can't O
ask O
for O
more. O

It O
had O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
I O
had O
been O
there O
and O
the O
experience B-TARGET
was O
very O
disappointing. O

Extremely O
expensive O
for O
the O
type O
of O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Oily O
croquettes, B-TARGET
marinated B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
bland O
and O
scarce O
transparent O
sheets, O
artichokes B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
clams I-TARGET
hard O
and O
bland O
when O
the O
price O
of O
the O
dish O
was O
28€, O
the O
monkfish O
carpaccio B-TARGET
was O
testimonial. O

The O
treatment O
of O
the O
maitre B-TARGET
d' O
who O
took O
our O
order O
was O
very O
unprofessional O
and O
bordering O
on O
rude. O

Since O
I O
discovered O
it O
a O
few O
years O
ago, O
every O
time O
I O
go O
to O
Barcelona, O
I O
go O
to O
l'Olive. O

I O
love O
it. O

A O
highly O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
more O
than O
acceptable. O

A O
bit O
expensive O
but O
certainly O
highly O
recommended O
to O
eat O
well O
in O
Barcelona. O

I O
prefer O
not O
to O
give O
my O
opinion O
because O
of O
the O
disappointment O
I O
had. O

I O
started O
the O
day O
on O
the O
right O
foot O
and O
continued O
it O
by O
choosing O
the O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat, O
chat O
with O
friends O
and O
be O
very O
well O
attended. O

The O
place B-TARGET
helps O
you O
to O
be O
able O
to O
exchange O
ideas O
with O
those O
who O
share O
the O
table O
given O
the O
low O
tone O
in O
which O
diners O
keep O
their O
conversations. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

Attentive, O
polite, O
discreet, O
all O
those O
who O
served O
us O
and O
when O
we O
said O
goodbye O
came O
to O
give O
us O
the O
last O
goodbye O
and O
"until O
next O
time...". O
We O
promised O
to O
return O
but O
this O
time O
with O
many O
more O
friends O
to O
whom, O
previously, O
we O
will O
have O
informed O
of O
that O
lunch O
that O
rounded O
off O
an O
unforgettable O
Saturday. O

Thank O
you. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
had O
already O
been O
to O
the O
previous O
one O
in O
Muntaner O
street. O

This O
one O
is O
much O
more O
elegant, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
is O
very O
correct O
and O
the O
ambience O
makes O
you O
feel O
very O
comfortable. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
of O
high O
quality. O

I O
recommend O
the O
battered B-TARGET
calçots. I-TARGET

No O
doubt O
we O
will O
repeat. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
great. O

But O
the O
woman O
who O
is O
the O
cashier B-TARGET
and O
who O
received O
us O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
spoke O
to O
us O
in O
Catalan O
even O
realizing O
that O
we O
did O
not O
understand. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
in O
very O
bad O
taste O
since O
I O
have O
never O
had O
that O
problem O
in O
Barcelona O
and O
this O
has O
affected O
my O
rating O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
ate O
quite O
well. O

The O
first B-TARGET
courses O
were O
good, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

It O
is O
closer O
to O
45 O
than O
thirty O
euros. O

The O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
exquisite. O

You O
can O
tell O
that O
they O
have O
been O
there O
for O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
and O
they O
lack O
a O
bit O
of O
experience, O
but O
you O
can O
see O
that O
they O
want O
to O
please O
the O
clientele. O

If O
they O
don't O
let O
their O
guard O
down, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
they O
will O
work. O

I O
wish O
them O
the O
best O
of O
luck. O

PS: O
It O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Darín's O
movie, O
they O
just O
liked O
the O
name. O

They O
should O
check O
the O
portions B-TARGET
they O
serve: O
they O
are O
really O
scarce!!! O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
the O
only O
downside O
is O
the O
one O
already O
mentioned; O
very O
"minimalist" O
portions. B-TARGET

For O
this O
reason O
I O
do O
not O
give O
a O
10 O
in O
"quality-price", O
although O
the O
quality O
is O
excellent. O

Yesterday O
we O
were O
at O
the O
Aragonia O
for O
lunch. O

The O
reservation O
without O
any O
problem, O
the O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
asking O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
in O
order O
and O
the O
point O
of O
the O
food. O

Highlight O
the O
presentation, O
all O
dishes, B-TARGET
very O
good. O

And O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
decorated, O
simple O
but O
elegant. O

We O
ate O
a O
menu O
that O
was O
25 O
euros, O
but O
with O
supplement O
for O
some O
dishes. O

My O
companion O
an O
onion B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
which O
texture O
and O
flavor O
were O
very O
good, O
but O
it O
seemed O
little, O
because O
in O
a O
few O
spoonfuls O
just O
eaten O
right O
away. O

And O
for O
the O
second O
course, O
hake B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
clams I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
green I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
which O
were O
few O
pieces, O
but O
of O
first O
quality O
and O
very O
good. O

Although O
I O
appreciated O
that O
they O
were O
not O
very O
large O
quantities, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
is O
usually O
eaten O
at O
home. O

I O
ordered O
foie B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
toast, I-TARGET
which O
the O
amount O
was O
more O
than O
correct, O
although O
there O
were O
few O
toasts O
for O
the O
amount O
of O
foie. O

Very O
good O
flavor, O
in O
any O
case. O

And O
the O
second, O
shoulder B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
veal, I-TARGET
a O
little O
small O
in O
size O
(it O
was O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
round) O
and O
very O
tasty. O

However, O
as O
I O
am O
a O
big O
eater, O
I O
had O
the O
sensation O
of O
eating O
too O
little. O

We O
both O
ordered O
dessert, O
Calanda O
peach. O

Very O
good O
and O
with O
lemon O
ice O
cream. O

What O
does O
give O
me O
the O
sensation O
of O
having O
eaten O
little. O

I O
was O
not O
hungry, O
but O
the O
portions B-TARGET
were O
small O
compared O
to O
the O
price. O

I O
thought O
they O
were O
with O
our O
portions, O
but O
they O
were O
not. O

I O
saw O
for O
example O
a O
plate O
of O
green B-TARGET
beans I-TARGET
that O
was O
a O
very O
very O
small O
amount O
that O
was O
the O
neighboring O
diners O
next O
to O
us. O

After O
trying O
several O
restaurants, O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
disappointed. O

I O
know O
that O
Aragonia O
cannot O
be O
compared O
with O
Bodega O
de O
Chema, O
Asador O
Broto O
or O
Filoxera, O
but O
with O
DGusta O
in O
Utebo O
I O
was O
much O
more O
satiated O
and O
with O
the O
feeling O
of O
having O
eaten O
more O
and O
for O
a O
similar O
price. O

That O
is O
to O
say, O
when O
you O
are O
satisfied O
with O
a O
restaurant, O
you O
feel O
like O
coming O
back. O

This O
has O
happened O
with O
the O
previous O
ones, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
the O
case O
of O
Aragonia. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
presented, O
superbly O
presented, O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
good O
products B-TARGET
and O
top O
quality, O
but O
quantities B-TARGET
in O
my O
view O
are O
scarce, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
a O
big O
eater. O

Greetings. O

We O
have O
dined O
very O
well, O
the O
menu O
montecito, O
the O
great O
attention, B-TARGET
the O
very O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
500cc, I-TARGET
is O
scarce O
for O
dinner. O

It O
is O
the O
only O
remarkable O
thing, O
it O
should O
be O
750cc, O
good O
value O
for O
money O
I O
recommend O
it. O

I O
was O
there O
this O
past O
Saturday O
for O
dinner O
and O
I O
have O
to O
congratulate O
both O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
and O
of O
course O
the O
food. B-TARGET

A O
very O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
well O
attended, O
very O
nice O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
well O
served O
and O
without O
waiting O
and O
the O
charming O
place. B-TARGET

We O
will O
come O
back. O

(The O
beef B-TARGET
entrecotte I-TARGET
was O
delicious). O

acceptable. O

The O
ham B-TARGET
was O
very O
well O
cut O
and O
of O
good O
quality. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
starters B-TARGET
were O
quite O
good. O

The O
ribs B-TARGET
could O
be O
improved, O
as O
they O
advertise O
ribs O
and O
include O
chops. O

Overall O
good. O

As O
for O
the O
food, B-TARGET
good O
value O
for O
money, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
well O
served O
and O
in O
sufficient O
quantity, O
we O
were O
not O
hungry, O
we O
were O
three O
people, O
only O
comment O
that O
surely O
by O
the O
time O
it O
was O
almost O
5 O
pm, O
the O
embers B-TARGET
should O
not O
be O
at O
its O
point O
since O
both O
the O
beef B-TARGET
entrecote I-TARGET
and O
the O
veal B-TARGET
did O
not O
have O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
first O
heat O
stroke O
that O
makes O
them O
golden O
brown. O

They O
were O
good O
but O
I O
have O
eaten O
better O
embers. B-TARGET

Otherwise O
everything O
was O
perfect, O
I O
recommend O
it O
and O
I O
put O
it O
among O
my O
favorites. O

Yesterday O
we O
celebrated O
the O
communion O
of O
our O
daughter, O
it O
was O
a O
rainy O
day, O
but O
it O
didn't O
matter O
because O
the O
preparations O
were O
outstanding, O
both O
in O
the O
place B-TARGET
and O
in O
everything O
else, O
the O
attention B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters O
was O
outstanding, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
the O
Ternasco B-TARGET
was O
embroidered, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
everything, O
you O
are O
the O
best. O

Second O
Communion O
Party O
that O
I O
had O
to O
spend O
in O
La O
Junquera. O

Nice O
treatment, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
arrived O
on O
time. O
.... O

We O
were O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
service, O
the O
food O
was O
just O
right, O
the O
food O
was O
good O
and O
the O
food O
was O
delicious. O

Today O
I O
went O
to O
eat O
with O
my O
parents O
and O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
ordinary O
compared O
to O
the O
price, O
45€ O
per O
person. O

I O
think O
that O
at O
those O
prices O
you O
have O
to O
be O
more O
demanding O
both O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
menu O
and O
especially O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
service. B-TARGET

Waiters B-TARGET
with O
little O
experience O
and O
little O
prepared O
for O
the O
price O
paid. O

I O
will O
not O
return. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

I O
recommend O
it O
very O
happy. O

that's O
not O
how O
presa O

is O
presented, O
I O
didn't O
like O
it, O
the O
worst O
thing O
was O
the O

I O
am O
not O
complaining O
about O
the O
price, O
but O
about O
the O
cuisine. B-TARGET

The O
best O
thing O
was O
the O
appetizer. B-TARGET

We O
were O
there O
on O
January O
14, O
we O
ordered O
a O
la O
carte, O
with O
water O
and O
mid-range O
wine. O

the O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice O
from O
the O
beginning O
but O
it O
is O
not O
very O
cozy, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
what O
matters O
most O
to O
me, O
I O
pay O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
room O
service O
and O
the O
kitchen. O
the O
room O
service B-TARGET
is O
correct, O
(just O
that, O
it O
lacks O
one O
person, O
for O
the O
price O
you O
pay). O

the O
bread: B-TARGET
scarce O
in O
its O
varieties, O
and O
very O
simple, O
without O
any O
kind O
of O
flavors, O
flours O
or O
fruits.we O
started: O
the O
water, B-TARGET
we O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
any O
rare, O
because O
no O
one O
gave O
us O
the O
option, O
they O
brought O
us O
bottled O
water O
in O
plastic O
(incomprehensible). O

We O
started O
with O
a O
cold B-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
apple I-TARGET
crispy, I-TARGET
scarce, O
it O
would O
be O
too O
much, O
(shameful) O
it O
would O
have O
30 O
grs O
of O
foie, O
the O
rest O
was O
correct; O
poached B-TARGET
egg I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
wild O
asparagus, O
correct, O
enough O
quantity, O
but O
like O
all O
the O
food, O
flat, O
bland, O
without O
flavors. O
Presa B-TARGET
iberica, I-TARGET
a O
fair O
portion, O
but O
tasty, O
as O
I O
said O
before, O
all O
bland O
(we O
are O
people O
who O
never O
add O
salt O
to O
our O
meals O
in O
all O
these O
restaurants) O
hake, B-TARGET
an O
impressive O
portion, O
both O
in O
size O
and O
cooking O
point, O
also O
bland, O
but O
recommendable. O

the O
desserts, B-TARGET
do O
not O
contribute O
anything O
new, O
simple, O
good O
but O
nothing O
more. O
to O
the O
coffees, B-TARGET
nothing O
of O
pettite O
fours, O
(lamentable O
for O
175 O
€ O
for O
two O
people, O
without O
charging O
us O
the O
coffees). O

Called O
by O
the O
fame O
and O
the O
Michelin O
star O
we O
went O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
Bal O
d'Onsera. O

We O
went O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
ordering O
the O
tasting O
menu O
and O
so O
we O
did. O

The O
first O
surprise O
was O
that O
they O
didn't O
ask O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
have O
an O
appetizer, O
but O
what O
surprised O
us O
the O
most O
was O
that O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
sparkling B-TARGET
water I-TARGET
they O
told O
us O
that O
they O
hadn't O
run O
out. O

I O
found O
this O
unforgivable O
for O
a O
restaurant O
with O
aspirations. O

Everything O
consisted O
of O
having O
gone O
out O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
any O
supermarket O
to O
buy. O

By O
this O
time O
we O
were O
managing O
to O
settle O
into O
the O
chairs, B-TARGET
which O
were O
very O
modern O
but O
difficult. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
eight O
courses: O
an O
appetizer, O
3 O
starters, O
2 O
main O
courses O
and O
two O
desserts. O

The O
highlights O
for O
me O
were O
the O
excellent O
vegetables B-TARGET
that O
accompanied O
all O
the O
dishes, O
with O
short O
and O
tight O
cooking O
points, O
very O
much O
in O
the O
line O
of O
Martín O
Berasategui. O

Extraordinary O
work O
in O
this O
aspect. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
textures I-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty, O
although O
the O
foam B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
hard. O

The O
asparagus, B-TARGET
green I-TARGET
beans, I-TARGET
cauliflower B-TARGET
cream, I-TARGET
broccoli, B-TARGET
all O
very O
well O
treated. O

The O
combinations B-TARGET
were O
very O
balanced, O
perhaps O
the O
one O
that O
said O
the O
least O
was O
the O
tomato B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
marinated I-TARGET
tuna, O
but O
the O
lobster B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
poached B-TARGET
egg, I-TARGET
much O
better. O

The O
roe B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
repetitive O
in O
the O
first O
three O
dishes. O

The O
hake B-TARGET
was O
well O
cooked, O
although O
a O
little O
bland, O
and O
gave O
way O
to O
what O
for O
me O
was O
the O
surprise O
of O
the O
day, O
a O
small O
piece O
of O
exquisite O
cutlet B-TARGET
with O
exquisite O
flavor O
and O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
cooking O
that O
left O
me O
wanting O
more.the O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
just O
right, O
the O
first O
around O
the O
red O
wine, O
with O
a O
sorbet B-TARGET
for O
me O
too O
dominated O
by O
cinnamon O
and O
with O
a O
wine B-TARGET
foam I-TARGET
again O
too O
consistent. O

Then O
a O
variety O
of O
peach O
textures O
with O
muscatel. O

Another O
negative O
point O
in O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
that O
I O
tried O
to O
have O
a O
sweet O
wine O
and O
the O
response O
was O
disappointing. O

On O
the O
first O
occasion O
I O
was O
told O
that O
they O
had O
"a O
muscatel O
and O
two O
others O
that O
I O
have O
forgotten O
the O
name O
of". O

In O
the O
end O
I O
was O
able O
to O
have O
a O
glass O
of O
Pedro O
Ximénez, O
with O
the O
coffee, B-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
good, O
there O
was O
no O
accompaniment, O
poor, O
very O
poor O
for O
this O
level O
of O
restaurant. O

The O
wine O
with O
which O
we O
accompanied O
the O
meal O
was O
an O
Atteca B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
Calatayud, I-TARGET
the O
house O
recommendation, O
excellent. O

As O
a O
curiosity, O
the O
bottle O
was O
labeled O
only O
in O
English O
and O
French! O
In O
summary: O
very O
good O
technical O
level, O
mastery O
of O
the O
cooking O
points O
and O
great O
professionalism O
in O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
aesthetically O
modern O
combinations B-TARGET
but O
quite O
conservative O
as O
far O
as O
flavors O
are O
concerned O
- O
except O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
vegetables. B-TARGET

To O
highlight O
that O
all O
prices O
include O
VAT, O
a O
detail O
that O
should O
be O
mandatory. O

As O
for O
defects: O
The O
quantities B-TARGET
, O
too O
scarce. O

In O
the O
desserts, B-TARGET
the O
absence O
of O
chocolate O
seems O
to O
me O
personally O
unforgivable, O
but O
that O
is O
a O
personal O
matter. O

The O
worst O
thing, O
for O
me, O
was O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
fair, O
with O
some O
serious O
failures O
such O
as O
the O
water B-TARGET
or O
the O
sweet B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
it O
was O
not O
up O
to O
the O
standards O
of O
a O
star. O

In O
general O
I O
expected O
more, O
it O
is O
still O
far O
from O
Las O
Torres O
or O
Lillas O
Pastia O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
below O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Zaragoza O
without O
a O
star. O

Thank O
you O
Pedro O
for O
this O
summary O
of O
your O
visit O
to O
the O
Bal O
d' O
Onsera O
restaurant, O
I O
am O
with O
you O
in O
that O
a O
high O
level O
restaurant O
is O
more O
than O
just O
a O
good O
cuisine, O
it O
must O
be O
accompanied O
by O
many O
other O
services O
such O
as O
having O
products O
like O
sweet O
wines O
or O
sparkling O
water O
as O
you O
comment. O

I O
had O
lunch O
this O
Tuesday, O
and O
it O
was O
wonderful, O
as O
always. O

True O
to O
my O
tradition O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
I O
did O
not O
order O
and O
let O
them O
give O
me O
to O
eat O
and O
drink. O

Congratulations O
to O
Bal O
D'Onsera O
for O
keeping O
their O
Michelin O
star O
in O
2010 O
and O
I O
regret O
that O
they O
took O
it O
away O
from O
Lillas O
Pastia. O

Now O
it O
is O
worth O
having O
another O
look O
at O
the O
comments O
or O
reviews O
of O
the O
"culinary O
experts". O

I O
wish O
there O
were O
more O
Michelin O
star O
restaurants O
in O
Zaragoza; O
it O
would O
be O
very O
good O
for O
everyone! O

I O
was O
not O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
Bal O
D'Onsera, O
nor O
did O
I O
understand O
why O
it O
was O
awarded O
the O
Michelin O
star, O
but O
you O
have O
to O
have O
a O
terrible O
lack O
of O
judgment, O
or O
enter O
with O
prejudices O
to O
evaluate O
it O
with O
two O
cachirulos, O
and O
more O
after O
describing O
the O
dishes O
as O
subtle, O
very O
good, O
refreshing, O
excellent O
or O
daring, O
most O
of O
them. O

By O
the O
way, O
by O
way O
of O
anecdote, O
you O
do O
not O
say O
why O
one O
of O
the O
dishes O
was O
left O
untouched, O
if O
it O
was O
because O
it O
was O
inedible, O
or O
someone O
had O
a O
special O
aversion O
to O
the O
veal O
snout, O
which O
by O
the O
way, O
if O
I O
return O
a O
dish, O
the O
last O
thing O
I O
want O
is O
to O
have O
to O
give O
explanations, O
if O
I O
think O
it O
is O
convenient O
to O
give O
them, O
I O
will O
give O
them O
on O
my O
own O
initiative. O

PS: O
I O
suppose O
that O
this O
restaurant O
will O
not O
weigh O
in O
the O
qualification O
not O
being O
in O
the O
center O
as O
the O
Novodabo O
(as O
much O
as O
it O
weighed O
to O
the O
Cachirulo O
or O
Dgusta, O
incidentally). O

PS2: O
Not O
all O
restaurants O
have O
the O
same O
cost O
for O
wine, O
but O
not O
all O
of O
them O
preserve O
it O
in O
the O
same O
way, O
not O
all O
of O
them O
have O
the O
same O
means O
(and O
costs) O
for O
its O
conservation, O
nor O
for O
its O
service, O
nor O
do O
they O
have O
a O
wide O
offer O
(and O
fixed O
assets) O
to O
satisfy O
the O
most O
demanding O
customers O
in O
this O
section, O
Nor O
do O
they O
all O
have O
the O
same O
concern O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
having O
qualified O
and O
trained O
staff, O
attentive O
to O
attend O
courses O
and O
events O
to O
give O
this O
section O
the O
importance O
that O
some O
people O
give O
it, O
which O
by O
the O
way O
is O
far O
from O
demanding O
Aragonese O
cavas O
on O
the O
menu, O
which O
is O
mostly O
like O
asking O
for O
tintorro O
on O
the O
menu. O

I O
am O
very O
glad O
that O
you O
did O
not O
like O
the O
chronicle, O
nor O
some O
others. O

That O
tells O
me O
that O
I O
am O
on O
the O
right O
track, O
that O
of O
not O
selling O
out O
to O
the O
easy O
populism O
of O
praising O
model O
restaurants. O

Precisely O
in O
this O
article O
I O
have O
tried O
to O
explain O
why O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
rate O
the O
dishes O
very O
well, O
for O
example, O
without O
being O
incongruent O
with O
a O
final O
negative O
evaluation O
of O
my O
visit, O
it O
seems O
that O
I O
have O
not O
succeeded, O
I O
have O
even O
put O
a O
simple O
formula, O
linear O
not O
to O
confuse O
more. O

I O
am O
sorry O
I O
cannot O
explain O
it O
more O
clearly, O
however O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
about O
the O
intelligence O
of O
the O
readers, O
which O
is O
undoubtedly O
much O
higher O
than O
what O
some O
people O
think.Some O
dates O
ago O
I O
commented O
on O
the O
value O
of O
the O
wine O
stock, O
which O
has O
to O
be O
paid, O
but O
as O
in O
life O
there O
are O
limits, O
I O
will O
not O
repeat O
myself. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
think O
that O
you O
are O
not O
Aragonese O
when O
you O
compare O
the O
cava O
of O
Aragon O
with O
the O
tintorro O
(I O
do O
not O
know O
with O
what O
meaning O
you O
say O
it, O
but O
it O
seems O
contemptuous). O

Do O
we O
Aragonese O
not O
have O
the O
right O
to O
defend O
what O
is O
ours, O
I O
say O
yes, O
and O
anyone O
who O
despises O
it, O
at O
least O
from O
me, O
will O
not O
get O
a O
smile O
on O
his O
face. O

If O
you O
only O
stopped O
to O
value O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
stock, O
we O
are O
off O
to O
a O
bad O
start. O

If O
you O
think O
that O
considering O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
Aragonese O
cava O
is, O
in O
a O
simplistic O
way, O
very O
low, O
is O
a O
proof O
that O
I O
am O
not O
Aragonese, O
you O
continue O
badly, O
and O
if O
you O
consider O
that O
the O
"pichi" O
gastronomy O
(to O
use O
a O
description O
that O
you O
yourself O
use) O
of O
which O
the O
Bal O
is O
an O
exponent, O
is O
populist, O
you O
finish O
badly. O

The O
formula O
without O
citing O
the O
coefficients O
or O
criteria O
to O
be O
evaluated O
is O
of O
little O
use O
to O
me, O
and O
by O
the O
way, O
I O
hope O
you O
have O
had O
the O
decency O
to O
apply O
a O
weight O
coefficient O
to O
the O
gastronomic O
result O
of O
the O
dishes. O

And O
by O
the O
way, O
when O
something O
is O
done O
well, O
I O
will O
be O
the O
first O
to O
defend O
it, O
but O
God O
forbid O
I O
should O
defend O
something O
simply O
because O
"it O
is O
ours", O
which O
I O
think O
is O
a O
disservice O
to O
"what O
is O
ours". O

I O
am O
stunned, O
and O
how O
did O
you O
come O
to O
such O
conclusions, O
because O
I O
don't O
use O
capital O
letters O
in O
a O
gentilicio? O

JUAS O
I O
repeat, O
if O
you O
do O
not O
give O
the O
respective O
parameters O
to O
qualify O
(the O
Px O
that O
you O
say), O
and O
the O
weight O
of O
each O
one O
(Cx), O
the O
formula O
is O
not O
explained O
nor O
is O
it O
useful. O

Come O
on, O
give O
it O
some O
courage, O
and O
make O
them O
public O
to O
know O
how O
you O
manage O
to O
rate O
the O
restaurant O
with O
2/5 O
cachirulos, O
even O
though O
you O
rate O
the O
cuisine O
so O
well. O

Come O
on, O
it's O
not O
so O
difficult, O
e.g. O

etc. O

or O
however O
you O
did O
it, O
(ahem, O
ahem) O
Unless O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
show O
your O
embarrassments, O
and O
phobias O
.... O

Congratulations, O
now O
you O
have O
understood. O

Luis, O
enjoy O
your O
dinner, O
and O
Jose, O
continue O
in O
your O
line O
that O
we O
love. O

I O
won't O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant, O
I'll O
play O
it O
safe O
and O
I'll O
stay O
at O
La O
Matilde.... O

Well O
Pedro, O
you O
have O
to O
have O
your O
own O
criteria, O
value O
the O
recommendations O
in O
their O
right O
measure, O
as O
what O
they O
are, O
personal O
impressions, O
and O
not O
be O
afraid O
to O
try, O
and O
even O
be O
disappointed. O

It O
won't O
be O
the O
first O
time O
that O
I O
have O
been O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
a O
non-recommendation, O
even O
though O
on O
some O
occasions O
they O
were O
trustworthy. O

But O
to O
each O
his O
own O
with O
his O
acts O
of O
faith, O
blind O
or O
not. O

Not O
for O
nothing, O
but O
you O
presumptive O
prescribers O
do O
harm, O
with O
your O
presumed O
experience O
and O
your O
presumed O
good O
taste. O

Just O
by O
comparison O
of O
your O
writings, O
you O
spend O
forty-something O
euros O
on O
a O
lambrusco, O
a O
pizza, O
some O
pasta O
and O
two O
scoops O
of O
ice O
cream O
park O
and O
you O
put O
4 O
cachirulos. O

You O
eat O
dishes O
that O
you O
will O
never O
make O
in O
your O
life O
and O
you O
put O
two O
cachirulos. O

Please, O
if O
you O
are O
ashamed O
of O
yourself, O
stop O
writing O
nonsense O
and O
hurting O
businesses O
set O
up O
with O
all O
the O
dignity O
in O
the O
world O
and O
go O
home O
and O
make O
some O
of O
those O
macaroons O
that O
you O
seem O
to O
like O
so O
much. O

Friend O
José O
Aranda, O
if O
there O
is O
something O
negative O
to O
comment O
on O
your O
criticisms, O
it O
is O
that O
you O
should O
take O
a O
little O
more O
care O
of O
your O
spelling O
and O
grammar. O

I O
hope O
it O
is O
because O
of O
a O
"material" O
error O
when O
writing O
and O
not O
because O
of O
a O
lack O
of O
knowledge O
of O
the O
language. O

As O
for O
the O
main O
issue, O
the O
criticisms O
in O
themselves, O
seem O
to O
me O
brave, O
and O
also, O
in O
most O
of O
the O
occasions, O
coincide O
with O
my O
opinion, O
from O
what O
I O
deduce O
that O
besides O
having O
the O
same O
tastes O
and O
criteria, O
you O
are O
also O
a O
person O
of O
honesty O
and O
honesty. O

I O
deduce O
that O
in O
addition O
to O
having O
the O
same O
tastes O
and O
criteria, O
you O
are O
an O
honest O
and O
honest O
person. O

Keep O
it O
up, O
say O
what O
you O
think, O
don't O
sell O
out O
to O
"marketing" O
or O
to O
the O
currents O
of O
opinion O
in O
vogue, O
many O
of O
us O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
it. O

Best O
regards. O

P.S. O

I O
was O
also O
disappointed O
with O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
what O
is O
worse, O
they O
served O
us O
an O
almost O
raw O
grouper O
that O
had O
not O
been O
previously O
frozen, O
consciously O
violating O
the O
current O
rule O
in O
this O
regard O
(the O
owner B-TARGET
and O
cook B-TARGET
was O
especially O
"proud" O
of O
not O
freezing O
the O
fish). O

What O
a O
pity O
that O
they O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
differentiate O
between O
a O
fish O
cooked O
"just O
right" O
and O
a O
fish O
that O
is O
directly O
raw, O
where O
the O
meat O
does O
not O
come O
off O
the O
bone O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
heat O
and O
cooking. O

And O
for O
the O
record, O
I O
love O
"sushi" O
and O
"sashimi", O
but O
one O
thing O
is O
a O
specific O
preparation O
complying O
with O
the O
requirements O
to O
prevent O
the O
ingestion O
of O
live O
anisakis O
and O
another O
to O
take O
an O
undercooked O
wild O
fish, B-TARGET
with O
high O
probability O
of O
existence O
of O
active O
parasites. O

What O
a O
pity O
that O
things O
are O
confused, O
there O
is O
nothing O
worse O
than O
a O
misinformed O
"insider", O
as O
is O
the O
case O
of O
this O
cook. B-TARGET

Ana, O
Carlos, O
Pedro, O
Anselmo: O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
your O
support. O

Anselmo, O
sorry O
for O
the O
spelling O
mistakes, O
they O
are O
the O
result O
of O
haste, O
I O
do O
not O
have O
as O
much O
time O
as O
I O
would O
like, O
I O
would O
appreciate O
if O
you O
could O
report O
me O
any O
error O
you O
find, O
thank O
you. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
agree O
with O
you O
in O
tastes, O
not O
so O
much O
that O
we O
were O
both O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
because O
I O
suppose O
that O
you, O
like O
me, O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
leave O
the O
Bal O
d'Onsera O
very O
happy, O
recommend O
it O
everywhere O
and O
not O
have O
the O
feeling O
of O
having O
wasted O
time O
and O
money, O
at O
least O
me. O

It O
is O
not O
easy, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
to O
put O
up O
with O
the O
gastronomic O
"interested O
parties", O
the O
"levitators", O
the O
"moscones", O
shameless O
and O
cowards O
(because O
nobody O
says O
their O
name, O
surname O
and O
"position" O
in O
this O
world O
when O
they O
insult) O
who O
write O
comments O
when O
an O
"intruder", O
like O
me, O
says O
what O
he O
thinks O
freely. O

There O
are O
many, O
very O
many, O
restaurant O
owners O
who O
have O
confessed O
to O
me O
that O
they O
do O
not O
appear O
in O
specialized O
media O
if O
they O
do O
not O
buy O
advertising, O
if O
they O
do O
not O
invite O
the O
smart O
guys, O
etc O
... O
some O
bend, O
what O
a O
remedy, O
it O
is O
the O
bread O
of O
their O
children, O
others O
however O
stubbornly O
hold O
on O
to O
their O
position O
and O
what O
less O
than O
the O
humble O
customers, O
like O
the O
one O
who O
writes, O
say O
publicly O
that O
they O
also O
have O
good O
tables. O

Rarely O
does O
one's O
own O
opinion O
coincide O
with O
that O
of O
other O
"gastronomic O
critics", O
but O
rarely O
have O
I O
been O
able O
to O
agree O
more O
than O
with O
that O
of O
José O
Aranda: O
My O
wife O
and O
I O
went O
last O
May O
25 O
(Tuesday) O
to O
celebrate O
something O
special O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
disappointed. O

We O
wondered O
why O
it O
had O
a O
star O
and O
it O
hurt O
our O
pockets. O

(almost O
the O
worst O
thing O
that O
can O
happen O
in O
a O
restaurant) O
I O
like O
to O
give O
my O
opinion O
after O
a O
while, O
when O
you O
have O
assimilated O
the O
experience. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
I O
don't O
remember O
any O
dish B-TARGET
from O
the O
tasting O
menu O
we O
had O
(symptomatic). O

I O
only O
remember O
a O
very O
dull O
and O
not O
very O
fresh O
hake. B-TARGET
When O
you O
go O
to O
a O
place O
like O
this O
you O
expect O
everything O
and O
maybe O
you O
become O
less O
permissive O
than O
with O
others, O
but O
even O
with O
this O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
think O
we O
can O
all O
name O
at O
least O
half O
a O
dozen O
places O
in O
Zaragoza O
where O
to O
eat O
(as O
an O
overall O
experience) O
better O
than O
here. O

I O
am O
sorry O
for O
your O
opinion O
of O
this O
restaurant, O
as O
well O
as O
that O
of O
some O
of O
the O
readers O
of O
this O
website. O

I O
will O
try O
to O
explain O
the O
reason O
for O
its O
stardom, O
and O
the O
way O
to O
understand O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant O
(which O
with O
all O
due O
respect O
is O
not O
possible O
for O
everyone O
because O
that's O
life). O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
is O
that O
I O
have O
been O
4 O
or O
5 O
times, O
but O
given O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
crisis O
I O
have O
not O
been O
there O
for O
two O
years, O
not O
because O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
but O
because O
I O
can O
not. O

But O
having O
said O
that, O
let's O
start O
commenting O
point O
by O
point: O
-THE O
LOCAL: O
For O
tastes O
colors. O

I O
personally O
don't O
like O
the O
street O
or O
the O
area B-TARGET
of O
Zaragoza O
(it O
should O
be O
more O
central), O
but O
having O
said O
that, O
I O
really O
appreciate O
the O
spaciousness O
of O
the O
round O
tables B-TARGET
(which O
I O
can't O
explain O
from O
an O
economic O
point O
of O
view, O
given O
that O
if O
all O
the O
tables O
are O
occupied O
by O
only O
two O
diners, O
it O
means O
a O
lower O
turnover). O

It O
is O
a O
joy O
and O
delight O
to O
have O
a O
table B-TARGET
with O
such O
a O
large O
tablecloth O
for O
you O
and O
your O
companion. O

It O
is O
necessary O
to O
value O
that O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
businessman O
towards O
his O
clients, O
thing O
that O
surely O
many O
person O
values O
it.... O

-THE O
SERVICE: O
you O
say O
that O
at O
no O
time O
did O
you O
empathize O
and O
that O
you O
like O
to O
be O
asked O
questions... O
"Well, O
look, O
I O
like O
not O
to O
be O
bothered. O

There O
are O
several O
types O
of O
customers O
here, O
those O
who O
like O
to O
be O
bothered O
and O
those O
who O
do O
not. O

If O
you O
are O
one O
of O
the O
former O
(go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
of O
the O
Palafox O
Hotel, O
where O
Jésús O
(the O
moustache) O
does O
it O
to O
perfection). O

I O
and O
many O
people O
like O
to O
eat O
well O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
evening, O
and O
we O
don't O
like O
to O
be O
interrupted O
by O
people O
who O
are O
interested O
in O
whether O
you O
like O
it, O
if O
everything O
is O
correct, O
if O
you O
want O
something O
else, O
etc. O

If O
you O
have O
been O
to O
many O
Michelin-starred O
restaurants O
you O
will O
see O
that O
the O
only O
time O
you O
are O
bothered O
is O
when O
they O
tell O
you O
the O
dishes O
when O
it O
is O
time O
to O
serve O
them, O
of O
course O
if O
you O
ask O
them O
and O
give O
them O
the O
floor O
then O
they O
answer O
you, O
but O
the O
point O
is O
that O
the O
diners O
enjoy O
their O
evening, O
both O
for O
the O
ambience O
and O
the O
food. O

And O
the O
service? O

It O
should O
always O
be O
exquisite O
and O
go O
unnoticed. O

If O
so, O
then O
it O
has O
been O
perfect. O

For O
me O
the O
SERVICE B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
I O
value O
it O
as O
one O
of O
the O
best O
because O
they O
do O
not O
bother. O

Regarding O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
don't O
understand O
you O
when O
you O
speak, O
excuse O
me O
for O
not O
even O
answering O
because O
I O
don't O
believe O
it. O

All O
the O
times O
I O
have O
been O
there O
was O
a O
girl O
with O
short O
black O
hair O
(Spanish) O
and O
the O
cook's O
wife O
(Carmen). O

Both O
very O
discreet O
as O
required O
in O
this O
type O
of O
establishment. O

-THE O
WINE B-TARGET
LIST: I-TARGET
Unfortunately O
I O
do O
not O
consider O
myself O
an O
expert O
but O
given O
the O
small O
size O
of O
the O
place, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
very O
successful O
wine O
list. O

I O
am O
also O
surprised O
by O
the O
promotion O
of O
the O
best O
wines B-TARGET
of O
our O
region, O
something O
that O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
betting O
on O
them O
as O
much O
as O
this O
restaurant O
does. O

Let O
me O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
wine O
cannot O
be O
worth O
the O
same O
in O
this O
establishment O
as O
in O
any O
other. O

Obvious. O

THE O
MENU: O
At O
this O
point, O
I O
agree O
with O
your O
decision O
to O
order O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

This O
is O
where O
the O
chef O
can O
surprise O
us O
and O
delight O
us O
with O
his O
know-how, O
I O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
the O
first O
time O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

I O
experienced O
different O
sensations O
and O
it O
was O
a O
culinary O
pleasure O
that O
I O
had O
rarely O
experienced O
before. O

The O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
imaginative, O
modern, O
sophisticated, O
etc. O
That O
you O
were O
left O
hungry? O

I O
don't O
believe O
it. O

I O
can O
believe O
it O
if O
someone O
else O
says O
it, O
but O
someone O
like O
you?look, O
I O
know O
people O
who O
go O
to O
Arzak O
and O
they O
say O
the O
same O
thing. O

And O
the O
same O
about O
Can O
Roca, O
what O
do O
I O
tell O
them? O

Majo, O
go O
to O
Calamar O
Bravo O
and O
order O
two O
sandwiches. O

You've O
got O
the O
wrong O
place. O

If O
you O
don't O
like O
it O
you O
have O
the O
WOK O
which O
is O
a O
self-service O
until O
you O
can't O
eat O
anymore... O
To O
finish, O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
lacks O
things. O

But O
that's O
why O
it O
doesn't O
have O
three O
stars O
and O
only O
has O
one O
star. O

What O
I O
totally O
agree O
with O
you O
about O
is O
the O
wine O
pairing. O

How O
are O
we O
going O
to O
order O
a O
wine O
if O
we O
are O
not O
able O
to O
guess O
what O
dishes O
they O
are O
going O
to O
serve O
us, O
they O
fail O
on O
this O
point. O

And O
as O
for O
the O
price, O
it O
is O
what O
it O
is. O

For O
me O
it O
is O
prohibitive O
in O
these O
times, O
but O
in O
spite O
of O
everything O
I O
don't O
think O
they O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
because O
there O
are O
only O
five O
tables. O

One O
last O
comment O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
chef B-TARGET
is O
that O
last O
year O
he O
was O
invited O
to O
the O
last O
Expo O
in O
China O
(it O
was O
in O
the O
press), O
and O
the O
dishes O
he O
presented O
in O
the O
Spanish O
week O
were O
typical O
Aragonese O
(borage, O
ternasco O
... O
and O
all O
with O
Aragonese O
wines), O
with O
this O
I O
just O
want O
to O
indicate O
my O
surprise O
at O
the O
propaganda O
of O
Aragonese O
food, O
which O
I O
am O
glad O
that O
someone O
defends O
it O
(and O
I O
say O
this O
as O
a O
Spanish O
Aragonese). O

Greetings O
and O
congratulations O
for O
your O
website. O

Gonzalo O

To O
Gonzalo, O
I O
will O
answer O
briefly: O
I O
don't O
like O
to O
be O
teased, O
the O
wait O
staff O
doesn't O
like O
to O
do O
it O
either, O
but O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
recognize O
that O
it O
is O
part O
of O
their O
"job" O
because O
some O
people O
like O
it, O
but O
it O
is O
different O
to O
tease O
than O
to O
be O
interested O
in O
the O
well-being O
of O
the O
diners, O
especially O
when O
they O
take O
a O
whole O
plate O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen, O
a O
"didn't O
you O
like O
it?", O
"is O
everything O
ok?", O
when O
picking O
up O
the O
plates O
doesn't O
bother, O
it's O
not O
teasing, O
it's O
politeness. O

He O
says O
he O
does O
not O
believe O
me O
when O
I O
commented O
that O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
person O
who O
brought O
me O
the O
dishes O
when O
I O
presented O
them, O
because O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
that O
the O
girl B-TARGET
did O
not O
speak O
Spanish O
even O
halfway, O
what O
do O
you O
want O
me O
to O
say, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
ask O
in O
the O
restaurant O
the O
staff O
they O
had O
for O
those O
dates, O
it O
is O
something O
so O
simple O
to O
validate O
that O
does O
not O
deserve O
more O
words. O

You O
don't O
think O
I O
was O
hungry O
either, O
well O
yes, O
I O
was O
hungry, O
and O
I O
like O
when O
I O
go O
to O
eat O
at O
a O
restaurant, O
regardless O
of O
the O
level O
and O
price, O
I O
like O
to O
leave O
with O
something O
to O
eat, O
otherwise O
I O
wouldn't O
call O
it O
going O
to O
eat... O
we O
could O
say O
"let's O
go O
to O
a O
cooking O
exhibition O
at O
the O
Bal O
d' O
Onsera O
restaurant O
where O
even, O
for O
80 O
euros O
per O
person, O
they O
allow O
us O
to O
try O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
each O
creation", B-TARGET
but O
then O
we O
go O
home O
to O
eat. O

Finally O
I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
you O
for O
including O
your O
name O
and O
surname, O
as O
I O
do, O
showing O
your O
face, O
it O
is O
very O
good O
to O
have O
different O
points O
of O
view, O
this O
enriches, O
I O
give O
my O
opinion O
and O
you O
give O
yours. O

Unfortunately O
the O
usual O
thing O
is O
that O
people O
on O
the O
internet O
hide O
and O
show O
their O
cowardice, O
this O
is O
not O
your O
case, O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
frankness. O

Good O
morning, O
I O
am B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
regular I-TARGET
customer I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
this I-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
convinced I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
this I-TARGET
type I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

Honestly, O
I O
find O
some O
of O
the O
negative O
comments O
about O
this O
restaurant O
mind-boggling. O

Despite O
them, O
Bal O
D'Onsera O
continues O
to O
maintain O
its O
Michelin O
star O
(4th O
consecutive O
year O
as O
the O
ONLY O
one O
in O
Zaragoza) O
and O
this O
year O
has O
1 O
Repsol O
sun; O
which O
distinguishes O
it O
as O
the O
ONLY O
restaurant O
in O
Aragon O
with O
double O
recognition O
by O
the O
2 O
reference O
guides O
of O
gastronomy. O

I O
agree O
with O
Gonzalo O
that O
it O
has O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go; O
until O
the O
2nd O
and O
3rd O
star O
and O
suns. O

But O
I O
also O
believe O
that O
this O
recognition O
should O
make O
those O
critical O
voices O
or O
comments, O
which O
can O
also O
be O
wrong, O
reflect. O

We O
were O
there O
last O
2-3-12 O
eating O
(celebrating O
our O
wedding O
anniversary) O
and O
I O
have O
waited O
a O
few O
days, O
to O
make O
the O
review, O
to O
get O
over O
the O
anger.we O
bought, O
on O
a O
discount O
website, O
two O
vouchers O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
establishment, O
a O
michelin O
star, O
great! O

The O
result O
could O
not O
have O
been O
more O
disappointing. O

For O
starters, O
the O
door B-TARGET
looks O
like O
a O
warehouse O
door, O
you O
call O
the O
intercom O
and O
they O
open O
it O
(although O
you O
will O
tell O
me O
that O
this O
is O
secondary). O

Once O
inside O
the O
decoration O
is O
as O
my O
wife O
would O
like O
it O
to O
be O
in O
our O
house: O
minimalist, O
the O
furniture B-TARGET
just O
say O
a O
couple O
of O
things: O
the O
chairs O
are O
uncomfortable O
and O
the O
tables O
are O
the O
size O
of O
"La O
Misericordia", O
if O
we O
do O
not O
bring O
the O
chairs O
together O
it O
seems O
that O
I'm O
eating O
angry O
with O
my O
wife. O

To O
finish O
with O
the O
previous O
before O
entering O
with O
the O
food O
a O
comment: O
a O
little O
background O
music O
would O
give O
intimacy, O
you O
could O
hear O
everything O
that O
was O
said O
in O
the O
other O
5 O
tables O
that O
were O
occupied O
(all O
of O
them O
with O
couples O
with O
discount O
coupons O
like O
us). O

Let's O
start O
with O
the O
menu: O

- O
Carpaccio B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
bonito I-TARGET
: O
It O
would O
be O
nice, O
I O
do O
not O
argue, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
taste O
anything, O
totally O
insipid, O
also O
had O
beets, B-TARGET
equally O
insipid, O
and O
an O
ice O
cream, O
I O
think O
I O
remember O
that O
mango, O
which O
had O
some O
flavor. O

- O
Scallop O
and B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
saffron I-TARGET
and O
winter O
vegetables: O
If O
you O
look O
at O
the O
name O
of O
the O
dish O
is O
in O
singular O
scallop O
and O
shrimp O
and O
the O
reason O
is O
none O
other O
than O
that O
there O
was O
one O
of O
each, O
in O
this O
case O
the O
flavors, O
impossible O
to O
eliminate, O
were O
correct, O
the O
saffron O
would O
be, O
but O
neither O
I O
tasted O
nor O
saw O
it. O

Cod B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
pil I-TARGET
pil I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
: O
No O
objection O
(that's O
the O
best O
I O
can O
say). O

Risotto B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
foie: I-TARGET
The O
foie O
has O
little O
mystery, O
a O
pan O
and O
nothing O
more, O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
spoil O
it, O
but O
the O
risotto O
had O
worse O
luck, O
it O
was O
risotto, O
I O
am O
sure O
of O
that, O
because O
I O
saw O
it, O
grains O
of O
rice O
and O
others O
but O
flavor, O
if O
very O
intense, O
to O
cream O
and O
only O
to O
cream. O

- O
Glazed B-TARGET
veal I-TARGET
cheek O
: O
Soft O
as O
butter O
but O
tasting O
nothing O
at O
all, O
totally O
bland. O

- O
Lemon, B-TARGET
mango I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
muscatel, I-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
wine: I-TARGET
The O
dessert O
was O
good O
(no O
more), O
we O
finished O
the O
meal O
with O
a O
Gin O
Tonic O
with O
gourmet O
preparation O
(it O
said O
so O
on O
the O
discount O
coupon): O
The O
combination O
came O
prepared O
from O
the O
kitchen. O

I'm O
sorry O
to O
be O
the O
one O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
cocktails O
are O
prepared O
at O
the O
table, O
from O
the O
kitchen O
comes O
the O
glass O
(or O
whatever, O
in O
this O
case O
glass) O
with O
the O
ice O
and O
the O
slice O
of O
lemon, O
lime O
or O
whatever O
and O
the O
gin O
is O
served O
in O
front O
of O
the O
customer O
as O
well O
as O
the O
tonic, O
it O
is O
not O
out O
of O
suspicion, O
it O
is O
a O
common O
practice O
(it O
does O
not O
cross O
my O
mind O
to O
doubt O
the O
ingredients O
but O
it O
does O
not O
look O
good). O

Now O
it O
is O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
service: B-TARGET
correct O
in O
the O
treatment O
but O
slow O
is O
little, O
between O
dish O
and O
dish O
some O
unacceptable O
waiting O
times, O
I O
have O
left O
for O
the O
end O
a O
small O
detail, O
for O
some O
unimportant, O
and O
is O
the O
size O
of O
the O
portions: B-TARGET
You O
can O
put O
less O
in O
each O
of O
the O
dishes O
but O
that O
is O
very O
very O
difficult O
(luckily O
we O
had O
taken O
the O
appetizer O
in O
Palomeque O
where O
the O
portions O
are O
generous). O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
I O
bought O
two O
vouchers O
in O
Groupalia, O
for O
the O
Restaurant O
of O
a O
Michelin O
Star, O
the O
Bal O
d'Onsera, O
at O
49 O
€ O
/ O
person, O
so O
I O
spent O
98 O
€ O
to O
take O
my O
companion O
to O
dinner, O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occasion. O

It O
seemed O
like O
a O
safe O
bet, O
"the O
only O
restaurant O
in O
Zaragoza O
with O
a O
Michelin O
Star! O

An O
appointment O
was O
essential, O
so O
I O
gave O
two O
weeks O
notice, O
choosing O
a O
Tuesday O
night. O

This O
was O
the O
menu O
that O
appeared O
on O
the O
coupon, O
the O
truth O
was O
that O
it O
looked O
very O
good....: O

Appetizers: O
Cod O
tartar. O

Gazpacho O
de O
Zaragoza. O

Starters:Contemporary O
salad O
of O
tuna, O
vegetables O
and O
seasonal O
vegetables. O

Egg O
with O
onions, O
saffron, O
vegetables O
and O
seafood O
risotto. O

Second O
course: O
Pyrenean O
beef O
sirloin O
with O
red O
bell O
pepper O
noodles O
and O
creamy O
potato. O

Roasted O
cod O
with O
tomato O
vinaigrette O
and O
borage. O

Dessert:Albericoque, O
sheep O
yogurt, O
caramel O
and O
elderflower O
aroma. O

Wine O

Well, O
to O
begin O
with, O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
and O
we O
were O
the O
first O
ones, O
the O
whole O
dining O
room O
to O
ourselves! O

When O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table, O
they O
told O
us O
that O
the O
beef O
tenderloin B-TARGET
had O
run O
out O
(beginning O
of O
the O
week, O
first O
to O
arrive O
for O
dinner, O
with O
a O
closed O
menu O
and O
warning O
with O
two O
weeks O
of O
time O
....), O
they O
would O
give O
us O
veal O
chop O
... O
first O
disappointment, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
not O
comparable O
(and O
certainly O
was O
not, O
it O
required O
chewing O
muuucho O
long O
time). O

After O
warning O
us O
of O
the O
change, O
he O
asked O
us O
if O
a O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
was O
okay O
to O
start O
with, O
so, O
in O
response O
to O
this O
question, O
I O
told O
him O
if O
they O
were O
not O
going O
to O
serve O
the O
three O
wines O
that O
appeared O
on O
the O
coupon, O
to O
which O
he O
replied O
that O
one O
of O
the O
wineries O
did O
not O
supply O
them O
until O
November O
... O
something O
that O
I O
personally O
think O
is O
great O
... O
but O
they O
were O
not O
going O
to O
serve O
us!!!, O
since O
they O
had O
considered O
two O
wines, O
one O
white O
and O
one O
red, O
to O
be O
enough. O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
when O
you O
have O
paid O
for O
a O
closed O
menu, O
they O
should O
adjust O
to O
what O
you O
have O
bought, O
because O
if O
not, O
it O
is O
a O
scam, O
and O
if O
they O
see O
that O
they O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
margin, O
when O
they O
get O
another O
voucher, O
they O
should O
adjust O
the O
menu O
to O
what O
they O
see O
fit, O
so O
the O
consumer O
can O
choose O
before O
buying.Well O
it O
does O
not O
end O
there, O
we O
asked O
about O
the O
cava B-TARGET
and O
he O
told O
us O
that O
they O
did O
not O
serve O
it O
either, O
they O
believed O
that O
the O
menu O
is O
fine!!!! O

To O
hallucinate! O

Of O
course, O
once O
you O
have O
already O
paid! O

Of O
course, O
as O
it O
was O
a O
special O
moment, O
I O
didn't O
want O
to O
make O
any O
circus, O
or O
ask O
for O
the O
complaints O
book, O
but O
the O
feeling O
I O
left O
that O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
was O
not O
good, O
I O
felt O
ripped O
off, O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
at O
all, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
food B-TARGET
good, O
but O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O
really O
is, O
and O
of O
course, O
I O
do O
not O
encourage O
anyone O
to O
buy O
coupons O
to O
eat O
there, O
since O
they O
risk O
being O
served O
what O
they O
consider O
at O
that O
time, O
regardless O
of O
what O
you O
have O
paid O
before. O

I O
was O
yesterday O
February O
22 O
in O
the O
restaurant O
bal O
d'osera O
and O
my O
surprise O
was O
that O
first O
they O
apologize O
because O
they O
still O
do O
not O
have O
coat O
racks, B-TARGET
then O
the O
tables B-TARGET
also O
tell O
you O
that O
they O
are O
provisional O
(they O
would O
not O
have O
opened O
yet, O
if O
they O
could O
not) O
because O
the O
price O
certainly O
have O
not O
lowered. O

For O
me O
with O
this O
reform O
has O
lost O
its O
charm, O
because O
you O
are O
dining O
without O
privacy, O
seeing O
and O
hearing O
the O
people O
at O
the O
bar. O

The O
food O
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service O
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service O
was O
good. O

I O
was O
there O
on O
6-12-08 O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
very O
good; O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
fasion, O
the O
walls O
are O
totally O
white, O
the O
chairs O
are O
very O
modern O
but O
comfortable O
and O
without O
any O
pictures. O

We O
ordered O
a O
la O
carte O
and O
as O
an O
appetizer B-TARGET
we O
had O
a O
spoonful O
of O
cod O
brandade O
with O
a O
shot O
of O
broth O
and O
almond O
foam, O
the O
truth O
was O
very O
delicate. O

for O
starters O
we O
had O
a O
truffle B-TARGET
mushroom I-TARGET
risotto I-TARGET
and O
a O
super O
medallion B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fresh I-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
gras O
grilled O
and O
some O
borage O
with O
spider O
crab, O
both O
were O
very O
good O
and O
cooked O
al O
dente. O
second O
grilled B-TARGET
hake I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
julienne I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cuttlefish I-TARGET
and O
a O
sirloin B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
with O
saffron, O
l O
amerluza O
was O
undercooked O
inside O
but O
hot O
and O
sirloin O
undercooked O
too O
and O
with O
very O
little O
sauce, O
and O
d O
epostre O
a O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
chocolates I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
textures I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
orange I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
reduced I-TARGET
and O
a O
meringue B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
ice O
cream O
and O
strawberries, O
very O
good O
all, O
two O
coffees O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
water O
for O
123 O
euros. O

This O
reservation O
was O
a O
success. O

The O
value O
for O
money O
is O
very O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

Large O
portions. B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
attentive O
and O
very O
friendly, O
the O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu O
is O
endless! O

The O
best, O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
artichokes I-TARGET
(they O
were O
delicious) O
and O
the O
calçots B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tiles, I-TARGET
very O
good! O

The O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
good. O

They O
were O
kind O
enough O
to O
change O
the O
grilled O
meat O
for O
a O
grilled O
vegetable O
(vegetarian O
option). O

I O
will O
repeat O
for O
sure! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
quite O
good O
(quality O
and O
quantity), O
although O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
be O
served O
(it O
is O
true O
that O
the O
place O
was O
full, O
but... O
you O
have O
to O
foresee O
it O
having O
more O
staff O
or O
taking O
less O
services). O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
more O
pleasant O
than O
it O
seemed, O
although O
the O
music O
was O
excessively O
loud O
(difficult O
to O
converse, O
due O
to O
the O
volume O
of O
the O
music O
and O
the O
number O
of O
diners). O

Somewhat O
expensive O
for O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
as O
a O
whole. O

But O
correct, O
decent, O
good. O

Great O
interior, B-TARGET
quality O
food. B-TARGET

Attentive O
and O
fast O
service. B-TARGET

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED. O

The O
calçotada B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
as O
for O
the O
meat B-TARGET
it O
was O
a O
little O
scarce O
or O
could O
be O
improved O
in O
quality O
without O
altering O
the O
number O
of O
pieces. O

Great, O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
and O
magnificent O
attention. B-TARGET

The O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu O
was O
magnificent O

Food B-TARGET
- O
6.5 O
(the O
main O
dish, O
the O
calsots, B-TARGET
were O
difficult O
to O
peel O
because O
the O
root O
was O
not O
cut O
and O
the O
quality O
was O
not O
very O
good. O

The O
romesco B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
and O
butifarra B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
good. O

We O
also O
liked O
the O
dessert). B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
- O
4 O
(We O
felt O
a O
bit O
invisible O
by O
the O
staff, O
they O
just O
went O
about O
serving O
the O
food. O

"everything O
ok? O

", O
"did O
you O
like O
it?"? O

These O
are O
typical O
questions O
that O
I O
found O
lacking O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

They O
gave O
us O
the O
option O
of O
repeating O
calsots B-TARGET
, O
always O
a O
detail O
that O
is O
appreciated O
but O
not O
enough O
to O
approve O
the O
service. O
) O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
- O
9 O
( O
good O
to O
eat O
a O
calsotada O
in O
couple O
and O
quiet, O
which O
was O
the O
case O
) O

quality-price O
- O
7 O
( O
the O
calsot B-TARGET
product O
can O
be O
improved, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
very O
correct O
and O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
too O
) O
. O

I O
approve O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
if O
they O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
calsot B-TARGET
is O
recommended O
100% O
to O
make O
a O
calsotada O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Barcelona. O

We O
had O
a O
very O
good O
dinner...reasonable O
quality O
and O
price. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent...although O
we O
didn't O
like O
how O
the O
head O
waiter B-TARGET
pressured O
the O
waiters...they O
don't O
deserve O
that O
treatment...and O
even O
less O
in O
front O
of O
the O
customers. O

In O
general O
we O
were O
satisfied...no O
doubt...we O
will O
be O
back. O

At O
first O
we O
found O
them O
a O
bit O
rude O
and O
having O
booked O
they O
were O
going O
to O
give O
us O
the O
worst O
table O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

But O
we O
asked O
to O
be O
changed O
and O
from O
then O
on O
everything O
was O
great. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
although O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
several O
times O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
coordination O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
in O
general. O

Very O
good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
place B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice O
and O
pretty. O

The O
calçots B-TARGET
were O
very O
good. O

Excellent. O

Adequate O
price O
and O
quality. O

Fast O
and O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
very O
cozy. O

We O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
because O
although O
it O
was O
full O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
fast. O

I O
also O
value O
its O
location, B-TARGET
for O
those O
of O
us O
who O
do O
not O
have O
a O
car, O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
get O
there O
because O
it O
is O
very O
central. O

Congratulations!!! O

A O
modern O
restaurant O
where O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
on O
point O
and O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly. O

The O
best O
decision O
is O
to O
eat O
there! O

correct O

We O
ate O
very O
well O
the O
whole O
family, O
the O
steak B-TARGET
was O
spectacular. O

The O
presentation O
of O
all O
the O
dishes O
was O
very O
good. O

A O
very O
satisfactory O
experience. O

The O

We O
were O
a O
family O
celebrating O
birthdays. O

I O
would O
repeat. O

good, O
quality O
price O

We O
ate O
calçots O
with O
my O
foreign O
friends, O
at O
night O
and O
in O
Barcelona... O
it O
didn't O
seem O
the O
best O
way O
to O
introduce O
this O
typical O
Catalan O
event O
to O
my O
friends, O
but O
in O
Balmes/Rossello O
we O
ate O
a O
calçotada B-TARGET
worthy O
of O
the O
best O
farmhouse. O

Great O
service, B-TARGET
real O
embers, B-TARGET
with O
artichokes B-TARGET
and O
parriladas. B-TARGET

The O
romesco B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
incredible O
and O
not O
with O
too O
much O
garlic O
that O
repeats O
all O
night O
as O
in O
some O
places! O

Highly O
recommended! O

Plentiful O
food, B-TARGET
good O
value O
for O
money O
if O
you O
order O
starter+second O
you O
can O
have O
dinner O
for O
about O
12 O
euros. O

We O
went O
3 O
friends O
to O
eat O
a O
calçotada O
and O
all O
told O
us O
that O
the O
calçotadas O
in O
the O
city O
were O
not O
good, O
you O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
outskirts, O
however O
we B-TARGET
loved I-TARGET
it, O
all O
very O
good, O
great O
treatment, B-TARGET
they O
taught O
us O
to O
eat O
the O
calçots, O
and O
very O
good O
price, O
I O
recommend O
it O
without O
doubt. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
decent, O
the O
bravas B-TARGET
were O
not O
spicy O
at O
all O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
poor. O

The O
Rte O
Balmes-Rosello O
enchanted O
us O
for O
its O
service, B-TARGET
location, B-TARGET
cleanliness O
and O
comfort. O

All O
exterior O
and O
bright O
with O
easy O
access. O

Congratulations O
from O
here O
to O
the O
management. O

Price-quality: O
excellent. O

Repetiremis O

All O
very O
correct: O
value O
for O
money, O
the O
facility O
to O
combine O
menu O
calçotada B-TARGET
with O
letter, O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
very O
well. O

The O
youngest O
diner O
at O
the O
table O
(20 O
years O
old) O
assured O
that O
he O
would O
return O
on O
his O
own. O

Menu O
calçotada B-TARGET
recommended O
for O
its O
value O
for O
money. O

If O
they O
keep O
it, O
next O
year O
we O
will O
repeat! O

I O
went O
with O
some O
Mexican O
friends O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
rare O
to O
have O
a O
calçotada O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona, O
but O
the O
experience O
was O
excellent, O
they O
offered O
us O
more O
once O
we O
finished. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
really O
exquisite O
and O
everything O
was O
very O
good. O

Highly O
recommended. O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
a O
calçotada B-TARGET
and O
there O
was O
no O
complaint. O

Very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
a O
very O
well O
decorated O
place B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

The O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
great O
by O
the O
whole O
team O
but O
in O
general O
we O
were O
lucky O
that O
Mr. O
Jose O
put O
part O
of O
his O
collaboration O
in O
the O
chosen O
menu. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
for O
sure. O

It O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
and O
the O
price O
was O
good O

Restaurant O
not O
to O
throw O
rockets O
but O
in O
general O
you O
leave O
satisfied. O

Very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
fast O
service B-TARGET

We O
ate O
two O
very O
good O
calçotades B-TARGET
menus! O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
very O
nice O
and O
constantly O
pending O
that O
we O
did O
not O
miss O
anything! O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
struck O
me O
as O
odd O
was O
that O
they O
didn't O
have O
the O
crema O
catalana O
for O
dessert! B-TARGET

:( O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
I O
totally O
recommend O
it! O

It O
had O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
I O
had O
an O
experience O
in O
which O
nothing O
was O
missing O
and O
so O
it O
was. O

I O
went O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
my O
in-laws O
and O
everyone O
was O
delighted: O
service, B-TARGET
speed, B-TARGET
cooking B-TARGET
points, I-TARGET
portions, B-TARGET
quality O
/ O
price, O
Only O
two O
buts: O
the O
house O
wine B-TARGET
had O
a O
point O
of O
rancidity O
and O
that O
we O
could O
have O
been O
placed O
in O
a O
more O
central O
point O
of O
the O
room. O

Totally O
recommendable O
for O
a O
relaxed O
meal, O
with O
the O
aroma O
of O
embers. O

An O
extensive O
menu, O
tasty O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
value O
for O
money, O
correct O
and O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
lively O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
it O
for O
any O
occasion O
.... O

I O
was O
really O
surprised O
because O
I O
had O
never O
been, O
we O
were O
a O
group O
of O
20 O
people O
and O
it O
was O
great, O
very O
cozy O
place, B-TARGET
modern O
decor, B-TARGET
good O
quality O
food B-TARGET
... O
And O
an O
economical O
price O
for O
Barcelona. O

Totally O
recommendable. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
too! O

Very O
attentive. O

Good O
service. B-TARGET

Good O
value O
for O
money O

Attentive O
waiters, B-TARGET
abundant O
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Great O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

Great! O

Lots O
of O
food! B-TARGET

Excellent O
quality/price O
ratio, O
very O
complete O
portions B-TARGET
and O
very O
nice O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Perfect O
service. B-TARGET

Menu O
calçotada O
very O
well, O
leaving O
repeat, O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

Perfect O
quality-price O
ratio. O

All O
very O
correct. O

We O
ordered O
the O
calçotada O
menu, O
and O
the O
calçots B-TARGET
left O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired. O

They O
were O
very O
small O
in O
size O
and O
some O
of O
them O
were O
empty? O

We O
have O
tasted O
infinitely O
better O
in O
other O
restaurants.... O

I O
won't O
go O
back O
for O
that O
reason. O

The O
barbecue B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
scarce... O

We O
were O
2 O
people O
to O
take O
the O
calçotada O
menu O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
too. O

We O
liked O
it. O

We O
ate O
very O
well. O

Quality O
and O
quantity. O

We O
were O
3 O
adults. O

Calçotada O
reservation. O

When O
we O
arrived O
they O
changed O
us O
to O
a O
better O
table O
than O
the O
one O
we O
had O
initially O
booked O
so O
that O
we O
were O
more O
relaxed. O

Very O
good O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
they O
gave O
us O
extra O
calçots O
without O
charging O
us. O

Very O
good O
memory. O

Perfect. O

The O
1st O
time O
I O
visit O
this O
place, O
promoted O
by O
the O
web. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
the O
promotion O
was O
slightly O
misleading O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
price O
of O
the O
menu, O
as O
it O
exceeds O
the O
average O
of O
20-30 O
euros O
as O
advertised, O
without O
any O
excess. O

3 O
people, O
4 O
portions O
of O
starters O
and O
two O
seconds, O
along O
with O
a O
dessert O
and O
2 O
coffees, O
drinks, O
water O
for O
two O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
wine, O
the O
total O
exceeds O
30 O
per O
person. O

We O
liked O
the O
place B-TARGET
very O
much, O
very O
good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
quiet, O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

We O
will O
come O
back O
for O
sure! O

Very O
pleasant, O
good O
value O
for O
money O
and O
good O
cuisine. B-TARGET

We O
will O
come O
back O
for O
sure. O

Good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
food, B-TARGET
a O
recommendable O
place. B-TARGET

The O
truth O
is O
that O
everything O
was O
very O
good, O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
and O
everything O
as O
expected. O

To O
put O
a O
downside, O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
calçots I-TARGET
was O
not O
purely O
romesco, O
but O
it O
was O
fine. O

We O
will O
surely O
repeat. O

Good O
food, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
excellent O
customer O
service. B-TARGET

We O
went O
for O
the O
calçot O
and O
everything O
was O
great O
but O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
very O
disappointing, O
it O
tasted O
a O
lot O
like O
tomato. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
is O
served O
already O
spread O
and O
we O
were O
not O
convinced O
either, O
some O
had O
too O
much O
tomato O
and O
personally O
I O
like O
to O
do O
it O
with O
a O
little O
garlic O
spread. O

Everything O
was O
very O
good, O
the O
price O
was O
very O
correct. O

Very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
we O
were O
happy O
with O
the O
calçotada. B-TARGET

Very O
attentive O
wait O
staff B-TARGET
and O
quality O
food B-TARGET
and O
well O
cooked. O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
although O
it O
lacks O
a O
"something". O

We O
went O
there O
with O
my O
partner O
and O
I O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
having O
dinner O
there O
and O
in O
the O
end O
we O
only O
had O
two O
portions. O

The O
service B-TARGET
lacks O
a O
lot O
of O
politeness. O

We O
ordered O
a O
portion O
of O
steamed B-TARGET
mussels I-TARGET
that O
were O
not O
cleaned O
and O
a O
portion B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
prawns I-TARGET
in O
which O
they O
did O
not O
even O
put O
cutlery. O

The O
shrimps B-TARGET
were O
good O
but O
expensive. O

We O
will O
not B-TARGET
return, I-TARGET
we O
will O
stay O
with O
"La O
Casa O
de O
Mar". O

I O
have O
been O
several O
times, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
professional O
and O
very O
friendly, O
as O
for O
the O
product, B-TARGET
very O
good O
in O
quality O
and O
quantity, O
no O
surprises. O

It O
is O
a O
correct O
site, B-TARGET
without O
more. O

For O
where O
the O
price B-TARGET
is O
stable O
and O
you O
do O
not O
get O
a O
scare O
... O

On O
Saturday O
June O
15 O
we O
were O
in O
this O
restaurant O
for O
dinner O
remembering O
good O
and O
bad O
days O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
mangrullo. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
unfortunately O
bad, O
from O
a O
raw O
balalao B-TARGET
gratin O
to O
a O
beef B-TARGET
cheek I-TARGET
reheated O
in O
the O
microwave O
and O
overheated O
until O
it O
was O
dry O
in O
the O
thinnest O
parts. O

See O
you O
never O
friends, O
good O
luck O
you O
will O
need O
it. O

I O
was O
there O
during O
the O
week O
and O
chose O
an O
executive O
daily O
menu. O

The O
first B-TARGET
course O
was O
a O
simplistic O
barracks O
style O
dish. O

The O
second O
plate O
of O
sea O
bream B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
that O
only O
contained O
the O
head. O

Return O
to O
the O
kitchen, O
kindness O
of O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
request O
for O
the O
bill O
and O
goodbye. O

I O
hope O
that O
with O
the O
menu O
their O
work O
will O
be O
more O
satisfactory. O

Bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth B-TARGET
after I-TARGET
reading I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
reviews, I-TARGET
especially I-TARGET
for I-TARGET
leaving I-TARGET
without I-TARGET
eating. I-TARGET

There O
are O
many O
menus O
of O
the O
day O
in O
Zaragoza O
that O
have O
no O
comparison O
with O
this O
one. O

Of O
course O
a O
disaster. O

Not O
to O
return O

I O
could O
not O
comment, O
but O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
was O
a O
very O
good O
place, B-TARGET
with O
hearty O
dishes. B-TARGET

We O
were O
served O
an O
appetizer, O
toast O
with O
tomato. O

First O
we O
had O
a O
pink B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
good O
to O
share, O
to O
eat O
then O
a O
chili O
peppers O
(some O
of O
them O
stung) O
and O
then O
eggs O
with O
foie O
gras. O

And O
for O
the O
main O
course O
we O
had O
cod O
with O
ali-oli, O
which O
I O
could O
not O
finish, O
because O
it O
was O
very O
full. O

And O
the O
dessert O
was O
a O
sorbet, O
because O
it O
was O
very O
full. O

To O
come O
back, O
no O
doubt. O

Hello. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
restaurant O
on O
12-9-2009. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
not O
one O
of O
those O
that O
dazzles O
with O
its O
luxurious O
decoration O
but O
it O
has O
that O
sobriety O
of O
the O
places O
that O
know O
they O
don't O
need O
it. O

The O
possibilities O
in O
the O
restaurant O
are O
basically O
three; O
normal O
menu, O
tasting O
menu O
and O
an O
intermediate O
option O
which O
is O
a O
selection O
of O
starters O
and O
desserts O
and O
a O
menu O
for O
the O
main O
course, O
which O
was O
our O
choice. O

Apart O
from O
the O
food O
ordered, O
the O
house O
invites O
you O
to O
three O
small O
appetizers O
in O
which O
I O
liked O
the O
anchovy B-TARGET
pate I-TARGET
the O
best. O
The O
first O
choice O
of O
the O
chef O
were O
a O
carp-chio O
of O
octopus, O
a O
sponge O
cake O
of O
mushrooms O
pecs, O
some O
prawns O
and O
a O
canelos O
of O
pickled O
partridge. O

In O
general, O
all O
the O
individual O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
of O
a O
high O
level, O
so O
no O
matter O
the O
number O
of O
people O
at O
the O
table, O
the O
starters O
will O
be O
the O
same. O

The O
main O
courses O
of O
the O
table O
were O
a O
sirloin O
steak, O
an O
Iberian O
prey, O
a O
canelos O
de O
ternasco O
and O
a O
monkfish. O

Both O
the O
sirloin B-TARGET
(more O
than O
generous O
piece) O
and O
the O
prey, O
which O
are O
the O
only O
two O
that O
I O
tried O
had O
a O
perfect O
touch O
of O
cooking O
(as O
requested) O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
diners O
the O
other O
dishes O
had O
a O
great O
level, O
being O
possible O
that O
the O
cannelloni B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
veal I-TARGET
was O
not O
as O
generous O
portion O
as O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dishes. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
again O
a O
tasting O
of O
different O
types O
of O
desserts O
that O
also O
had O
a O
very O
high O
level, O
according O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dinner. O

But O
where O
this O
restaurant O
stands O
out O
is O
undoubtedly O
in O
its O
EXTENSIVE O
wine O
cellar B-TARGET
with O
a O
range O
of O
prices O
more O
than O
accessible O
to O
any O
pocket O
as O
there O
are O
countless O
wines O
that O
do O
not O
exceed O
20 O
euros O
but O
of O
course O
if O
we O
are O
looking O
for O
something O
more O
level O
of O
course O
the O
site O
and O
especially O
his O
sommelier O
respond O
with O
great O
efficiency O
and O
level. O

And O
it O
is O
not O
only O
the O
great O
variety O
of O
table O
wines B-TARGET
(red, O
white O
or O
champagne) O
if O
not O
that O
has O
an O
even O
wider O
variety O
of O
wines O
of O
other O
types O
(oloroso, O
amontillados, O
PX, O
ports, O
...) O
without O
forgetting O
the O
cognac O
and O
other O
liquors O
including O
his O
letter O
of O
cigars. O

Of O
course O
a O
place O
that O
with O
moderation O
in O
the O
drink O
goes O
for O
about O
55 O
euros O
per O
person, O
but O
if O
you O
want O
to O
give O
yourself O
a O
tribute O
in O
the O
choice O
of O
drink O
you O
have O
what O
you O
want O
to O
order. O

The O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
it O
is O
a O
very, O
very O
recommendable O
menu, O
in O
which O
I O
would O
highlight O
the O
cod B-TARGET
really O
tasty O
and O
just O
right, O
and O
the O
dessert. B-TARGET

We O
were O
well O
attended O
in O
spite O
of O
our O
small O
"chore" O
to O
the O
restaurant O
because O
of O
ten O
people O
that O
we O
were O
going O
to O
be, O
we O
had O
for O
health O
reasons O
4 O
casualties O
and O
we O
were O
only O
6. O

To O
recommend O
and O
repeat O

We O
had O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
in O
January O
and O
were O
quite O
disappointed. O

We O
chose O
a O
closed O
menu O
and O
when O
they O
were O
about O
to O
start O
serving, O
they O
told O
us O
that O
they O
were O
changing O
the O
black O
rice O
with O
cuttlefish O
for O
a O
rice O
with O
chorizo O
(!). O

Although O
we O
warned O
that O
one O
person O
didn't O
like O
the O
chorizo, O
they O
said O
it O
was O
only O
a O
"subtle O
aroma O
of O
chorizo" O
and O
it O
didn't O
turn O
out O
that O
way O
(it O
tasted O
like O
Rioja O
potatoes). O

I O
think O
that O
when O
you O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant O
of O
that O
level O
and O
there O
is O
a O
change O
in O
the O
menu, O
you O
should O
be O
warned O
when O
presenting O
the O
menu, O
and O
if O
it O
is O
done O
later, O
you O
should O
be O
given O
options O
to O
change O
the O
dish O
if O
a O
diner O
does O
not O
like O
it. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
did O
not O
seem O
to O
us O
worthy O
of O
a O
restaurant O
of O
level. O

There O
were O
flavors O
that O
should O
have O
been O
secondary O
and O
detracted O
from O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dish. O

I O
am O
referring O
to O
the O
brushstroke O
of O
mustard O
that O
accompanied O
the O
cheeks, O
which O
far O
from O
being O
a O
brushstroke, O
was O
a O
lot O
and O
when O
combined O
with O
the O
cheeks O
and O
the O
potato, O
it O
killed O
the O
flavor B-TARGET
of O
these O
ingredients, O
which O
were O
the O
protagonists O
of O
the O
dish. O

Ouch! O

And O
to O
put O
"stones" O
of O
those O
that O
are O
sold O
in O
tourist O
stores O
as O
an O
accompaniment O
to O
the O
coffee... O
it O
has O
no O
name! O

Great! O

Everything O
was O
very O
good O

Well, O
everything O
was O
fine. O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
value O
for O
money, B-TARGET
good O
choice. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
selection O
and O
preparation O
of O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

Excellent. O

To O
repeat O
on O
another O
good O
occasion O
that O
deserves O
it. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
in O
August O
at O
the O
Matilde. O

It O
was O
Thursday O
night O
and O
we O
were O
the O
only O
customers O
in O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
chose O
the O
most O
economical O
closed O
menu O
option O
for O
4 O
people O
and O
to O
say O
that O
the O
quality-price B-TARGET
of O
what O
we O
got O
was O
poor, O
the O
menu O
consisted O
of O
an O
appetizer O
of O
cream O
of O
nuts O
that O
was O
really O
good. O

We O
followed O
with O
a O
starter O
of O
melon B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
really O
different O
with O
ice O
cream O
which O
was O
the O
best O
dish O
of O
the O
dinner. O

Next O
we O
moved O
on O
to O
a O
sea O
bream B-TARGET
that O
was O
good O
but O
really O
small O
in O
quantity. O

It O
wouldn't O
even O
be O
a O
small O
dorada O
for O
the O
4 O
of O
us. O

Then O
we O
had O
3 O
meatballs B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
free O
range O
chicken O
which O
was O
without O
a O
doubt O
the O
worst O
dish. O

The O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
a O
chilindron O
with O
a O
certain O
taste O
of O
agarrado O
and O
the O
meatballs B-TARGET
were O
just O
that...meatballs. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
like O
that O
as O
a O
main O
course O
in O
a O
25 O
euro O
menu O
does O
not O
seem O
normal. O

As O
an O
appetizer O
maybe, O
but O
not O
as O
the O
main O
course. O

Finally O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
cinnamon O
white O
chocolate O
with O
homemade O
banana O
ice O
cream O
and O
cookie O
mousse O
that O
was O
just O
right. O

In O
short, O
value B-TARGET
for O
money O
for O
a O
25e O
menu O
was O
poor O
and O
I O
doubt O
very O
much O
that O
we O
will O
try O
more O
expensive O
menus O
again. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
in O
Zaragoza. O

Both O
for O
its O
history, O
its O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
its O
wine O
cellar. B-TARGET

Professional O
and O
close O
service. B-TARGET

The O
effort O
that O
restaurants O
of O
this O
level O
make O
(and O
have O
to O
make) O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
times O
and O
offer O
closed O
menus O
at O
an O
affordable O
price, O
is O
not O
always O
recognized. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
quality B-TARGET

Everything O
very O
correct O

Very O
tasty O
food, B-TARGET
very O
fast O
and O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

My O
children O
were O
delighted, O
and O
a O
reasonable O
price O
for O
this O
part O
of O
the O
Ensanche. O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
both O
in O
quality O
and O
service. O

It O
was O
great, O
we O
were O
very O
well O
attended O
and O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice O
and O
as O
for O
a O
small O
group O
as O
the O
one O
we O
went O
with. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
very O
attentive, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent, O
I O
will O
recommend O
it. O

Good O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
go O
in O
group O
with O
friends O
or O
colleagues! O

good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
, O
food B-TARGET
, O
attention B-TARGET
and O
price B-TARGET
! O
! O
!!! O

The O
only O
drawback O
the O
noise B-TARGET
... O
but O
wow O
.... O
everything O
great O
!!! O

Delicious O
food B-TARGET
, O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
, O
right O
price! B-TARGET

Calçots B-TARGET
abundant O
but O
too O
thick. O

Grilled B-TARGET
artichokes I-TARGET
only O
one O
half O
per O
person. O

Lamb B-TARGET
very O
scarce. O

The O
service B-TARGET
very O
attentive O
and O
pleasant, O
the O
food B-TARGET
in O
great O
quantity O
and O
of O
good O
quality. O

Very O
well O
adapted O
menus B-TARGET
for O
couples. O

To O
put O
some O
"but" O
I O
will O
say O
that O
it O
is O
a O
good O
option O
for O
large O
groups O
rather O
than O
couples O
because O
of O
the O
ambient O
noise. O

For O
the O
rest O
everything O
was O
fantastic. O

We O
ordered O
the O
calçotada O
menu. O

Very O
good O
value B-TARGET
for O
money. O

Very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

We O
will O
repeat. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
recommendable O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
grilled O
meats B-TARGET
are O
superior. O

The O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
very O
complete. O

A O
but. O

When O
it O
is B-TARGET
full, I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
configuration I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
place O
amplifies O
the O
noise. O

Good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
great O
food, B-TARGET
well B-TARGET
located. I-TARGET

Highly O
recommended. O

It O
is O
an O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
for O
sure. O

We O
ate O
very O
well, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
was O
very O
cozy. O

The O
only O
downside, O
to O
say O
the O
least, O
was O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
first O
course O
almost O
before O
we O
had O
finished, O
but O
then O
everything O
was O
great. O

We O
were O
invited O
to O
a O
pitcher O
of O
sangria. O

Highly O
recommended. O

Everything O
very O
correct, O
but O
in O
principle O
they O
were O
not O
aware O
of O
the O
reservation O
previously O
made. O

We O
went O
for O
dinner O
last O
week O
and O
it O
was O
quite O
a O
discovery, O
although O
no O
one O
ordered O
pizza B-TARGET
they O
look O
great O
and O
their O
oven O
is O
wood-fired, O
we O
will O
surely O
return O
to O
try O
them O
.... O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
they O
classify O
it O
as O
typical O
Catalan O
food O
and O
Mediterranean O
diet O
and O
in O
reality O
it O
is O
a O
pizzeria-grill O
where O
they O
also O
serve O
calçots, O
escalibada O
and O
local O
sausages. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
not O
expensive, O
but O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
gloomy O
and O
lacking O
in O
brightness. O

Friendly O
service. B-TARGET

We O
asked O
for O
snails O
that O
were O
on O
the O
menu O
and O
there O
was O
none, O
and O
lamb O
shoulder O
that O
was O
on O
the O
menu O
as O
a O
suggestion O
and O
there O
was O
none O
either. O

In O
the O
end O
we O
ordered O
an O
entrecote B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
dry O
and O
small O
and O
a O
skewer B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
veal I-TARGET
(in O
which O
there O
were O
only O
4 O
taquitos O
of O
veal) O
and O
it O
was O
also O
dry. O

We O
will O
not O
return. O

Everything O
was O
perfect, O
both O
the O
attention B-TARGET
of O
the O
staff O
and O
their O
products. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

The O
quality O
of O
their O
meats B-TARGET
and O
grilled O
vegetables B-TARGET
is O
impressive! O

I O
have O
never O
tasted O
such O
good O
wood-fired O
pizzas B-TARGET
either. O

A O

Mediterranean B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
! O

This O
Sunday, O
March O
15, O
I O
traveled O
from O
Galicia O
with O
some O
friends O
to O
compete O
in O
the O
marathon O
of O
Barcelona. O

As O
I O
am O
from O
the O
land, O
I O
told O
them O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
a O
calçotada O
to O
try O
something O
that O
in O
Galicia O
is O
not O
usually O
eaten. O

For O
logistical O
reasons, O
I O
looked O
for O
a O
place O
in O
Barcelona, O
near O
the O
hotel, O
although O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
eat O
in O
a O
farmhouse. O

Well, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
a O
success. O

They O
all O
loved O
it, O
very O
good, O
well O
done, O
and O
the O
meats, B-TARGET
potatoes B-TARGET
al I-TARGET
caliu, I-TARGET
artichokes B-TARGET
and O
escalibadas, B-TARGET
really O
good. O

They O
were O
delighted, O
and O
I O
was O
even O
more O
so. O

I O
love O
to O
take O
people O
to O
my O
land O
and O
they O
come O
back O
delighted O
with O
the O
treatment O
and O
the O
people. O

Highly O
recommended, O
both O
the O
quality B-TARGET
and O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Really O
good O
quality B-TARGET
and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
grilled B-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and O
the O
calçots B-TARGET
were O
very O
well O
done O
and O
tasty. O

I O
will O
repeat! O

Calçots B-TARGET
...and O
Artichokes B-TARGET
...sublime O
..I O
think O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona O
city O
.... O

Service B-TARGET
a O
little O
slow...but O
I O
understand O
that O
it O
was O
Friday O
night O
and O
Let's O
go O
that O
has O
become O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
restaurants....(the B-TARGET
next O
one O
some O
pizzas...that O
seeing O
the O
one O
of O
our O
neighbors O
of O
mesa....) O

We O
ate O
a O
calçots B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
was O
not O
bad O
but O
not O
a O
marvel. O

Generous O
in O
quantity, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
meat B-TARGET
left O
a O
little O
to O
be O
desired. O

As O
well O
as O
the O
romesco, B-TARGET
which O
was O
a O
bit O
"canned". O

The O
best O
thing O
was O
the O
grilled O
flavor O
and O
the O
abundant O
quantity O
of O
calçots. B-TARGET

Also O
the O
speed O
of O
service. B-TARGET

Variety, O
quantity, O
and O
excellent O
value O
for O
money, O
to O
improve: O
the O
bread. B-TARGET

I O
am O
fond O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

All O
the O
ember B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
they O
serve O
it O
to O
you O
warm. O

For O
children O
very O
good O
croquettes B-TARGET
and O
hamburgers B-TARGET
of O
good O
quality. O

I O
have O
had O
coffee O
with O
mothers O
from O
school, O
and O
I O
had O
a O
good O
perception O
of O
the O
place, O
of O
course, O
because O
I O
am O
on O
a O
terrace. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
we O
had O
dinner O
with O
four O
people, O
we O
all O
agreed O
on O
the O
same O
thing, O
the O
lack O
of O
dynamism O
and O
sympathy O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
after O
dinner; O
the O
rice O
was O
soupy, O
the O
squid B-TARGET
could O
not O
taste O
more O
like O
ammonia, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
was O
normal, O
the O
best O
thing O
was O
the O
mandarin B-TARGET
sorbet I-TARGET
and O
30euros O
for O
that O
quality B-TARGET
is O
totally O
disproportionate. O

I O
will O
not B-TARGET
return. I-TARGET

I O
was O
there O
yesterday O
for O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend. O

And O
I O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

The O
meats B-TARGET
were O
very O
well O
prepared. O

For O
dessert O
I O
had O
a O
white B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
that O
I O
recommend. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
and O
I O
will O
go O
there O
again. O

18/03/2008. O

Pleasant O
surprise. O

It O
really O
is O
like O
arriving O
at O
the O
Tacita O
de O
Plata. O

A O
surprising, O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
food B-TARGET
as O
you O
can O
only O
find O
in O
Cadiz O
and O
the O
Port. O

We O
tried O
the O
ham, B-TARGET
prawns B-TARGET
and O
turbot, B-TARGET
and O
my O
mouth O
is O
still O
watering O
remembering O
it. O

A B-TARGET
must I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Zaragoza. I-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
terrible...the O
waitresses B-TARGET
were O
unprofessional O
and O
rude. O

The B-TARGET
prices I-TARGET
have I-TARGET
gone I-TARGET
up O
quite O
a O
bit. O

the O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
lacks O
details O

Good, O
we O
were O
last O
night O
1/08/09 O
having O
dinner, O
we O
booked O
for O
4 O
two O
couples, O
we O
were O
going O
to O
order O
some O
rations O
and O
a O
second O
fish, O
but O
in O
the O
end O
we O
decided O
to O
share O
rations, O
the O
tomato O
Andalusian O
style O
they O
took O
it O
as O
an O
appetizer O
while O
we O
were O
waiting O
(a O
detail) O
the O
truth O
that O
we O
ordered O
almost O
everything O
and O
everything O
was O
of O
good O
quality, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
Blanc O
Pescador, O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
we O
were O
very O
well, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
the O
price O
we O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
more O
expensive O
to O
eat O
so O
rations, O
but O
it O
was O
quite O
tight, O
so O
I O
recommend O
it, O
the O
sea B-TARGET
anemones I-TARGET
that O
I O
had O
never O
tried O
I O
really O
liked. O

Quiet O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Kitchen B-TARGET
very O
well O
presented O
and O
quickly, O
everything O
in O
its O
point O
and O
well O
finished. O

The O
sea O
bream B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
port I-TARGET
style I-TARGET
was O
very O
nice O
with O
a O
very O
well O
finished O
sauce B-TARGET
although O
it O
was O
presented O
without O
flaking O
and O
that O
was O
something O
annoying O
when O
it O
came O
to O
enjoy O
it. O

Ample O
and O
very O
abundant O
portions. B-TARGET

The O
tomato, B-TARGET
as O
a O
starter, O
is O
something O
special O
to O
highlight. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
pudding B-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
was O
delicious O
although O
it O
had O
almost O
all O
the O
cream O
(from O
a O
can) O
that O
accompanied O
it; O
it O
would O
be O
worth O
considering O
another O
presentation. O

The O
price O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
compared O
to O
places O
where O
you O
are O
pushed O
around O
in O
a O
bad O
way, O
it O
is O
worth O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
calm O
and O
let O
you O
have O
your O
way, O
although O
they O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
your O
wishes. O

We O
plan O
to O
return. O

Gentlemen: O
There O
are O
several O
mistakes O
in O
the O
description O
here. O

I O
begin: O
In O
this O
restaurant O
we O
do O
not O
work O
the O
monkfish, O
the O
shrimp O
are O
from O
the O
south O
of O
the O
Bay, O
the O
prawns O
from O
Sanlucar, O
everything O
related O
to O
seafood O
and O
pescaitos O
sent O
us O
from O
Cadiz O
a O
seafood O
company, O
highlighting O
the O
cuttlefish O
and O
dogfish. O

I O
recommend O
not O
to O
miss O
the O
tortillitas O
in O
your O
meal O
and O
continue O
enjoying O
this O
establishment. O

A O
LITTLE O
PIECE O
OF O
CADIZ, O
IN O
THE O
HEART O
OF O
ZARAGOZA! O

By O
the O
way, O
the O
tomatoes O
are O
from O
Almeria, O
and O
as O
for O
the O
price, O
you O
can't O
even O
imagine O
the O
effort O
we O
make O
to O
adjust O
them, O
since O
bringing O
everything O
from O
there O
costs O
a O
lot, O
but O
it's O
worth O
it O
to O
see O
our O
customers O
leaving O
happy O
and O
satisfied O
with O
our O
products. O

A O
LITTLE O
PIECE O
OF O
CÁDIZ O
IN O
THE O
HEART O
OF O
ZAAGOZA. O

For O
two O
people, O
I O
recommend O
a O
special B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
port I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
second I-TARGET
course. I-TARGET

This O
way O
you O
share O
the O
starters O
of O
the O
menu O
for O
the O
two O
people. O

I O
found O
it O
a O
bit O
expensive, O
I'm O
not O
used O
to O
going O
to O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant. O

The O
quality B-TARGET
of O
the O
food O
was O
exceptional, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
personal B-TARGET
service. I-TARGET

There O
is O
no O
problem O
going O
on O
a O
"normal" O
Saturday O
without O
booking O
in O
advance. O

I O
can O
not O
contribute O
anything O
more O
than O
what O
I O
have O
already O
read O
here. O

The O

is O
that O

with O
1 O

of O

3 O
cuttlefish O
and O
1 O
anchovy? O

Is O
that O
it? O

or O
has O
it O
been O
a O
mistake? O

is O
that O
the O
truth, O
reading O
the O
description, O
makes O
you O
want O
to O
go, O
but O
if O
then O
it O
is O
as O
seen O
in O
the O
photos, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
joke. O

If O
someone O
can O
help O
me, O
I O
would O
appreciate O
it. O

I've O
been O
there O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
for O
dinner O
and O
it O
wasn't O
bad O
at O
all. O

I O
tasted O
the O
tomato O
Andalusian O
style, O
some O
fried O
sea O
nettles, O
a O
sea O
bream O
on O
the O
back O
and O
a O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
homemade O
(but O
not), O
typical O
prefabricated O
and O
thawed O
cake. O

Both O
the O
tomato B-TARGET
(very O
good) O
and O
the O
sea O
bream B-TARGET
were O
just O
right, O
but O
there O
were O
several O
things O
that O
did O
not O
fit. O

The O
sea O
anemones B-TARGET
were O
nothing O
like O
the O
memory O
I O
had O
of O
those O
of O
Cadiz, O
there O
were B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
couple I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
people I-TARGET
smoking I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
non-smoking O
area, O
but O
worst O
of O
all O
was O
the O
way O
we O
were O
served O
by O
the O
"maitre B-TARGET
d', O
she O
was O
serious, O
dry, O
surly O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
two O
or O
three O
steps O
below O
the O
place O
where O
she O
worked, O
she O
was O
unwilling O
to O
our O
attention O
as O
she O
was O
seen O
all O
the O
time O
in O
the O
kitchen O
talking O
to O
another O
of O
her O
colleagues. O

hello O
good O
thank O
you O
to O
all O
the O
people O
who O
have O
put O
these O
comments O
because O
this O
truth O
lets O
you O
know O
the O
good O
and O
bad O
that O
has O
the O
restaurant O
but O
I O
recommend O
to O
all O
people O
this O
restaurant O
because O
very O
few O
restaurants O
in O
zaragoza O
have O
pruductos O
that O
has O
the O
port O
as O
for O
example O
the O
fish O
is O
of O
very O
high O
quality O
and O
the O
meat O
is O
very O
good. O
The O
good O
thing O
about O
the O
restaurant O
is O
that O
it O
prepares O
its O
delicious O
dishes O
at O
the O
time O
the O
food O
is O
never O
prepared O
and O
then O
heated O
and O
just O
in O
time O
for O
the O
customer O
and O
with O
great O
cleanliness O
in O
the O
kitchen O
and O
with O
great O
care O
with O
the O
fish O
and O
other O
products O
and O
with O
excellent O
homemade O
desserts O
such O
as O
quesa O
pasiega, O
fruit O
pudding, O
melon O
balls O
macerated O
in O
pedro O
xmenez O
wine, O
imperial O
cake O
of O
almonds O
and O
chocolate, O
etc.. O

thanks O
to O
customers O
the O
truth O
is O
you O
let O
us O
prepare O
things O
with O
all O
our O
love O
and O
affection O
so O
that O
when O
you O
finish O
eating O
tell O
us O
this O
all O
excellent O
and O
that's O
what O
leaves O
us O
want O
more O
to O
the O
kitchen O
and O
continue O
with O
new O
ideasthanks O
and O

On O
15/03/14 O
I O
went O
for O

with O
the O
family O
to O
what O
I O
thought O
was O
still O
a O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

What O
a O
disappointment. O

The O
only O
thing O
worthwhile O
was O
a O
portion B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
and O
FOUR B-TARGET

The O
dogfish B-TARGET
(bienmesabe) O
neither O

nor O
bienmesabe O
was O
MULTIVITAMINIC O
SHARK O
(so O
I O
was O
told). O

The O
chanquetes B-TARGET
, O
refried. O

The O
golden B-TARGET
cod I-TARGET
was O
a O
typical O
scrambled O
cod. O

But O
the O
star O
was O
what O
on O
the O
menu O
was O
a O
"salad O
with O
ventresca, O
piquillo O
and O
onion" O
we O
asked O
to O
change O
the O
piquillo O
for O
tomato O
and O
they O
brought O
us O
a O
"salad O
with O
several O
lettuces, O
piquillo O
peppers, O
onion, O
asparagus, O
a O
little O
bit O
of O

[...] O
Saturday O
I O
had O
dinner O
at O
the O
new O
Q-Art B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
(click O
to O
see O
the O
review), O
disastrous, O
I O
will O
not O
return. O

Has O
anyone O
been O
there, O
in O
which O
case O
[...] O

I O
have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
have O
always O
left O
myself O
and O
my O
guests O
very O
satisfied. O

On O
the O
subject O
of O
smoke B-TARGET
I O
can't O
comment O
as O
I O
have O
never O
been O
with O
the O
restaurant O
full, O
whenever O
I O
have O
been O
there O
it O
was O
always O
half O
full O
and O
there O
was O
no O
smoke O
problem. O

However, O
I O
understand O
that O
with O
what O
you O
describe O
you O
are O
so O
unhappy. O

About O
the O
food, B-TARGET
what O
can O
I O
say, O
you O
yourself O
say O
that O
the O
quality O
is O
very O
good, O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
variety, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
treatment I-TARGET
quite O
good, O
with O
many O
details O
of O
the O
house. O

The O
price B-TARGET
for O
me O
is O
very O
tight, O
especially O
compared O
to O
other O
similar O
restaurants, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
value O
for O
money O
in O
Zaragoza O
without O
being O
a O
particularly O
innovative O
cuisine B-TARGET
or O
aspiring O
to O
the O
highest O
quality. O

Regarding O
the O
Aragonese B-TARGET
cava, I-TARGET
please O
don't! O

I O
won't O
say O
that O
there O
are O
no O
bad O
Catalan O
cavas, O
which O
there O
are, O
but O
in O
general O
the O
Aragonese O
ones O
are O
very O
bad O
and O
their O
price O
has O
gone O
through O
the O
roof, O
I O
think O
mainly O
because O
of O
their O
increased O
consumption O
due O
to O
politicking. O

Yesterday O
we O
had O
dinner O
in O
this O
restaurant O
and O
everything O
was O
really O
exquisite. O

The O
grilled O
sardines B-TARGET
were O
spectacular. O

The O
Minicuit B-TARGET
was O
the O
same. O

The O
apple B-TARGET
pie, I-TARGET
hummmm. O

We O
really O
loved O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
treatment. B-TARGET

Totally O
recommended. O

Congratulations. O

Small O
and O
cozy O
dining B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
my O
partner O
and O
I O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
dinner. O

I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
there O
is O
quality, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
attention B-TARGET
of O
those O
responsible O
for O
the O
restauante O
unbeatable. O

The O
grilled B-TARGET
sea I-TARGET
bream I-TARGET
and O
the O
vegetables B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
eggs I-TARGET
were O
very O
well O
cooked. O

Overall O
good O
price, B-TARGET
good O
cuisine, B-TARGET
good O
service. B-TARGET

A O
wise O
choice. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
I O
booked O
at O
El O
Real, O
and O
the O
experience B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
both O
the O
kind O
treatment O
of O
the O
lady B-TARGET
who O
served O
our O
table, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
that O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
excellent. O

We O
chose O
a O
tasting O
menu, B-TARGET
with O
appetizer, B-TARGET
starter, B-TARGET
a O
fish, B-TARGET
a O
meat B-TARGET
and O
two O
desserts, B-TARGET
and O
all O
of O
them O
very O
well O
presented O
and O
everything O
was O
really O
good, O
even O
the O
sirloin B-TARGET
with O
honey O
was O
just O
right. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasant O
experience. B-TARGET

Totally B-TARGET
recommendable. I-TARGET

We O
ate O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
exquisite O
and O
very O
well O
priced. O

The O
place B-TARGET
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
were O
great. O

A O
success. O

I O
made O
the O
reservation O
through O
this O
page O
and O
booked O
the O
Daily O
Menu. O

When O
I O
arrived, O
with O
a O
companion, O
they O
offered O
me O
the O
menu O
instead O
of O
the O
Daily O
Menu. O

I O
had O
to O
say O
that O
I O
had O
a O
reservation O
for O
the O
Menu O
and O
they O
still O
refused. O

In O
fact O
I O
had O
to O
show O
the O
reservation O
confirmation O
I O
had O
on O
my O
cell O
phone. O

Frankly, O
I O
did O
not O
like O
the O
treatment. B-TARGET

But O
in O
addition, O
the O
two O
dishes B-TARGET
I O
ate O
were O
frankly O
bad, O
they O
were O
not O
well O
prepared O
(escalibada O
toast O
with O
quail O
and O
grilled O
hake). O

And O
finally, O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
coffee, O
we O
were O
warned O
to O
be O
quick... O
In O
short, O
very O
bad O
service B-TARGET
and O
bad O
food. B-TARGET

I O
WILL O
NOT O
RETURN. O

Very O
very O
good, O
I O
recommend O

It O
was O

Hello, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
sensational, O
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
small B-TARGET
details I-TARGET
were O
really O
at O
a O
very O
high O
level. O

The O
reservation O
was O
made O
for O
15h30. O

Until O
16h15 O
they O
did O
not O
give O
us O
a O
table. O

The O
restaurant's B-TARGET
excuse O
was O
that O
on O
January O
1st O
there O
is O
always O
a O
lot O
of O
work. O

We O
don't O
understand O
why O
they O
made O
us O
choose O
between O
the O
first O
and O
second O
shift O
when O
we O
made O
the O
reservation. O

We O
don't O
even O
understand O
why O
we O
made O
the O
reservation O
because O
we O
suffered O
the O
same O
queue. O

We O
have O
been O
in O
restaurants O
that O
also O
have O
double O
shifts O
and O
never O
had O
anything O
like O
this O
happen O
to O
us. O

On O
top O
of O
that, O
they O
blamed O
the O
customer. O

More O
bad O
news: O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
they O
called O
us O
to O
confirm O
the O
reservation...what O
for? O

I O
ate O
very O
well O
and O
was O
very O
well O
attended. O
The O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
served O
me O
was O
very O
attentive O
to O
everything. O

Everything O
excellent O
except O
the O
place B-TARGET
where O
they O
put O
the O
table O
on O
Christmas O
Day: O
in O
the O
tent! O

Taking O
into O
account O
that O
I O
was O
with O
2 O
very O
old O
people, O
it O
was O
not O
the O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
accommodate O
us. O

Besides, O
I O
had O
already O
told O
them O
that O
one O
of O
them O
was O
in O
a O
wheelchair. O

I O
don't O
understand O
how O
they O
didn't O
reserve O
us O
a O
table O
in O
an O
enclosed O
space O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
rooms O
they O
have. O

They O
put O
us O
on O
the O
terrace, B-TARGET
without O
prior O
notice. O

The O
table O
was O
missing O
3 O
pieces O
of O
cutlery, O
having O
previously O
confirmed O
the O
number O
of O
diners O
on O
the O
same O
day. O

There O
was O
an O
excessively O
high O
level O
of O
noise, B-TARGET
very O
annoying O
and O
from O
the O
menu B-TARGET
we O
hired O
we O
almost O
did O
not O
see O
a O
single O
dish, O
practically, O
they O
brought O
us O
practically O
what O
they O
wanted. O

Good O
place, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
my O
guests O
were O
impressed. O

Everything O
was O
very O
good O

One O
of O
the O
best O
paellas B-TARGET
I O
have O
ever O
tasted, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
impeccable. O

It O
is O
an O
endearing O
place B-TARGET
in O
Barcelona O
that O
you O
have O
to O
know, O
unparalleled O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(but O
noisy, O
not O
for O
an O
intimate O
dinner) O
and O
cosmopolitan. O

The O
service B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters, O
excellent, O
very O
professional. O

The O
paella B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
good O
ones, O
although O
not O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona, O
too O
much O
tomato O
and O
therefore O
acidic, O
but O
tasty. O

Seafood B-TARGET
and O
meat B-TARGET
excellent O
but, O
of O
course, O
high O
prices. O

Service B-TARGET
too O
fast, O
too O
many O
people. B-TARGET

You O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
they O
want O
to O
throw O
you O
out!!!! O

Chaotic! B-TARGET

Everything O
was O
perfect. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended. O

What O
a O
good O
memory O
I O
have O
of O
this O
place! B-TARGET

Not O
bad O
as O
a O
start. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
restaurant O
where O
they O
took O
me O
to O
eat O
when O
I O
landed O
in O
Barcelona. O

First O
meal B-TARGET
of O
"business" O
and O
my O
taste O
memory O
remembers O
perfectly O
the O
taste O
of O
fried B-TARGET
fish, I-TARGET
paella B-TARGET
... O
The O
treatment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
staff O
is O
remarkable, O
they O
are O
always O
watching O
that O
nothing O
is O
missing O
at O
the O
table. O

Upon O
arrival O
there O
is O
usually O
bread O
with O
tomato O
and O
ham. O

is O
the O
best O

Very O
surprised O
with O
the O
comments O
below, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites, O
whenever O
friends O
come O
we O
take O
them O
there, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
is O
unbeatable O
and O
the O
owner O
is O
very O
dear, O
friendly O
and O
integrates O
with O
people. O

The O
food B-TARGET
has O
always O
been O
very O
good, O
I O
think O
these O
people O
have O
had O
bad O
luck O
because O
I O
actually O
go O
two O
or O
3 O
times O
a O
year O
and O
always O
slago O
happy. O

Paella B-TARGET
very O
tasty O
and O
very O
attentive O
waiters. B-TARGET

We O
left O
very O
happy. O

They O
treated O
us O
very O
well, O
human O
treatment, B-TARGET
they O
gave O
us O
a O
double O
round O
of O
drinks. O

We O
ate O
some O
generous O
rice B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
some O
starters B-TARGET
based O
on O
steamed O
cockles, O
Huelva O
shrimp O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
Andalusian O
friduria O
quite O
good. O

but O
I O
insist, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
the O
best.... O

<->the O
cuisine. O

<->none O
dish O
was O
right. O

<->quality O
of O
a O
humble O
neighborhood O
bar O
at O
the O
price O
of O
a O
Michelin O
star O
restaurant. O

<+>the O
service O

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

Very O
good O
value B-TARGET
for O
money. O

We O
ordered O
the O
pica B-TARGET
pica I-TARGET
speciality O
of O
the O
house: O
they O
served O
it O
cold, O
oily O
and O
badly O
battered O
squid, O
refried O
sardines...immundo. O

It O
was O
even O
worse O
because O
then O
came O
the O
paella B-TARGET
parellada O
bathed O
in O
oil, O
overdone...I O
think O
it O
was O
an O
artoz O
boiled O
in O
oil. O

To O
forget. O

This O
past O
summer O
I O
had O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant O
because O
we O
were O
going O
to O
the O
movies O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
friends O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
have O
dinner O
there. O

I O
said O
at O
the O
beginning O
that O
I O
don't O
like O
buffet O
restaurants, O
but O
I O
gave O
in. O

I O
prefer O
a O
few O
things O
and O
that O
they O
come O
to O
serve O
me O
at O
the O
table. O

That O
of O
getting O
up O
to O
go O
get O
the O
dishes O
completely O
breaks O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
with O
your O
friends O
quietly O
and O
without O
interruptions. O

Besides, O
I O
don't O
like O
having O
to O
wait O
for O
something O
to O
be O
grilled. O

For O
what O
the O
menu O
costs, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
"get O
your O
boots O
on" O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
fine. O

I O
particularly O
value O
quality O
over O
quantity. O

But O
apart O
from O
all O
this, O
the O
value O
for O
money B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Anyway, O
it's O
not O
the O
food O
I O
wanted O
to O
talk O
about. O

I O
wanted O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
lighting. B-TARGET

The O
light B-TARGET
is O
white O
fluorescent O
type O
and O
gives O
the O
sensation O
of O
eating O
in O
a O
company O
canteen. O

It's O
not O
cozy, O
very O
cold O
emotionally O
and O
not O
intimate O
at O
all. O

I O
think O
that O
if O
they O
spaced O
the O
tables O
a O
little O
and O
changed O
the O
lighting O
for O
something O
warmer O
the O
place O
would O
gain O
a O
lot, O
but O
perhaps O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
aimed O
at O
the O
public O
that O
pays O
attention O
to O
details O
and O
wants O
to O
be O
comfortable O
when O
eating. O

Well, O
frankly, O
it O
is O
a O
place B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
worth O
it. O

A O
lot O
of O
signage, O
very O
modern, O
lots O
of O
space, O
to O
put O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
then O
the O
rest O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

I O
strongly O
recommend O
to O
opt O
for O
the O
Wok B-TARGET
of O
Via O
Universitas O
without O
any O
doubt, O
it O
is O
close O
to O
there. O

Much O
better O
in O
everything, O
and O
if O
I O
remember O
correctly O
even O
cheaper. O
