The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
meat O
lover O
you O
have O
a O
wide O
menu B-TARGET
to O
choose O
from, O
although O
yesterday O
they O
didn't O
have O
steak. B-TARGET

The O
only O
thing O
that O
surprised O
us O
was O
that O
they O
served O
the O
starters O
and O
main O
courses O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

Buff, O

I O
don't O
know O
where O
to O
start! O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
attention, O
Impressive. O

The O
Meat, B-TARGET
Phenomenal O

The O
Tapas B-TARGET
and O
Drinks B-TARGET
and O
the O
Ambience, B-TARGET
Extraurinadio. O

I O
have O
already O
celebrated O
many O
birthdays O
in O
restaurants, O
but O
I O
have O
never O
been O
treated O
so O
well O
and O
I O
have O
done O
so O
many O
details O
k O
I O
liked O
and O
excited O
a O
lot. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
to O
have O
a O
great O
time, O
what O
are O
you O
waiting O
for? O

Reserve O
a O
table, O
9 B-TARGET
Reinas I-TARGET
is O
worth O
it. O

Thank O
you O
Team B-TARGET

Whenever O
we O
come O
to O
Barcelona O
we O
go O
for O
lunch O
or O
dinner. O

Not O
to O
be O
missed! O

Excellent O
meats B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
pasta B-TARGET
(especially O
the O
sorrentinos!). B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
and O
attentive. O

We O
will O
continue O
to O
visit O
every O
time O
we O
come O
to O
Barna! O

I O
was O
with O
my O
partner O
on O
April O
10, O
celebrating O
my O
birthday O
which O
was O
the O
day O
before. O

We O
went O
to O
9R B-TARGET
because O
of O
an O
opinion O
on O
this O
page O
that O
said O
it O
was O
very O
good, O
and O
we O
totally O
agree O
with O
this O
opinion. O

At O
9R B-TARGET
we O
were O
treated O
great, O
Julio B-TARGET
was O
attentive, O
friendly O
and O
fun, O
he O
treated O
us O
wonderfully O
as O
well O
as O
the O
others. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
elegant, O
tastefully O
decorated, O
to O
put O
a O
downside O
I O
think O
the O
lighting B-TARGET
(2nd O
floor) O
is O
very O
strong, O
they O
could O
put O
a O
softer O
light O
or O
warm O
.... O
this O
would O
be O
the O
only O
downside O
I O
can O
put O
them O
and O
is O
a O
joke O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
is O
a O
10, O
we O
were O
invited O
to O
cake O
and O
champagne O
for O
no O
reason! O

We O
will O
be O
back O
for O
sure! O

100% O
recommendable! O

An O
excellent O
experience, B-TARGET
an O
excellent O
disposition B-TARGET
and O
good O
attention. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
divine. O

We O
were O
having O
dinner O
and O
we O
loved O
everything. O

The O
space B-TARGET
is O
very O
relaxing, O
with O
colors O
that O
make O
the O
corners O
sober. O

The O
staff's B-TARGET
attention I-TARGET
was O
impeccable. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
unbeatable. O

The O
detail B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
invitation I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
starter O
by O
the O
restaurant, O
unexpected O
and O
grateful. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
in O
capital O
letters O
!!!! O

A O
recommendable O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona. O

Ask O
for O
a O
table O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O

The O
entrance B-TARGET
door I-TARGET
is O
automatic O
and O
if O
it's O
cold, O
you O
can O
feel O
the O
current. O

The O
best O
meat B-TARGET
I O
have O
ever O
eaten O
in O
Barcelona. O

Best O
meat B-TARGET
in O
BCN. O

Spectacular O
entraña, B-TARGET
I O
needed O
to O
eat O
real O
meat B-TARGET
after O
the O
vacations! O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
food B-TARGET
- O
we O
will O
be O
back! O

It O
was O
cold! B-TARGET

No O
need O
for O
ice O
in O
the O
drink! O

We O
had O
a O
variety O
of O
starters, B-TARGET
quite O
good! O

based O
on O
empanadilla, B-TARGET
chorizo B-TARGET
and O
others. O

Then O
Salomillo. O

Unlike O
other O
Argentinians, O
if O
you O
ask O
for O
it O
alive O
they O
bring O
it O
alive, O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

The O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
very O
cordial O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
was O
cozy O
and O
modern. O

Ideal O
for O
dinners O
for O
4 O
to O
8 O
people. O

Very O
good, O
really. O

Darin O
would O
be O
proud O
(if O
he O
is O
not O
already). O

A O
beautiful O
place B-TARGET
with O
a O
spectacular O
view, B-TARGET
a O
very O
expensive O
menu, B-TARGET
not O
recommended O
for O
what O
you O
eat, O
the O
maitre B-TARGET
d' O
is O
very O
bad O
mannered, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
is O
very O
distracted, O
a O
lot O
of O
noise. O

Very O
slow O
service, B-TARGET
mediocre O
quality O
and O
expensive O
price. O

Not O
recommended. O

Excellent O
food. B-TARGET

Waiters B-TARGET
very O
well. O

Head O
waiters B-TARGET
not O
very O
nice. O

Receptionists B-TARGET
very O
well. O

Very O
good O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
but O
too O
noisy. O

Price O
a O
little O
high. O

Excellent O
location. B-TARGET

Correct O
restaurant O
in O
the O
line O
of O
the O
other O
olive O
restaurants, O
etc. O

Perfect O
location B-TARGET
both O
in O
summer O
and O
winter. O

The O
food O
is O
very O
good, O
we O
have O
been O
going O
there O
for O
years O
and O
we O
have O
always O
liked O
their O
cuisine, B-TARGET
very O
attentive. O

I O
think O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
complete O
but O
I O
would O
add O
something O
like O
stewed O
rabbit O
or O
baked O
turkey/chicken, O
and O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
dessert, B-TARGET
I O
think O
it O
is O
very O
good, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
restaurants O
with O
the O
largest O
amount O
of O
dessert O
and O
very O
varied, O
I O
congratulate O
you O
without O
further O
reference O
I O
greet O
you O
and O
hope O
to O
visit O
your O
restaurant O
soon, O
see O
you O
soon. O

It O
is O
undoubtedly O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
in O
Barcelona O
for O
its O
quality O
both O
in O
the O
product, B-TARGET
as O
in O
the O
care O
of O
every O
detail O
of O
its O
staff. B-TARGET

Everything O
taken O
care O
of O
and O
approved O
by O
the O
meticulous O
eye, O
elegant, O
tireless O
worker, O
and O
professional O
of O
its O
orchestra O
director; O
Mr. B-TARGET
Ramon I-TARGET
Ferreira. I-TARGET

little O
kindness O
of O
the O
maitre B-TARGET
d' O
. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
not O
very O
attentive O
for O
the O
exorbitant O
price O
.... O

An O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
business O
lunch. O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
with O
the O
company O
last O
week O
and O
everything B-TARGET
was I-TARGET
fantastic. I-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

Excellent O
value O
for O
money O
and O
well O
located. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located O
and O
has O
a O
magnificent O
terrace O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
has O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

I O
would O
never O
order O
monkfish B-TARGET
with O
sauce O
or O
casserole. O

The O
rice B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
will O
be O
very O
good O
but O
in O
monkfish B-TARGET
I O
don't O
think O
so. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
prawns B-TARGET
in O
particular O
is O
fantastic. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
normal. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
should O
be O
more O
attentive O
to O
the O
clientele. O

The O
average O
per O
person O
is O
50 O
euros. O

Lunch O
or O
dinner O
at O
the O
Barceloneta O
is O
a O
guarantee O
of O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
good O
location. B-TARGET

Service B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

Time B-TARGET
between O
courses O
correct. O

Rapidity B-TARGET
in O
requesting O
plates O
and O
solucitud O
account. O

Dined O
in O
one O
hour. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
great O
for O
its O
ambience O
and O
privileged O
location, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
correct O
and O
attentive, O
the O
value O
for O
money, O
good O
quality, O
quantity O
rations B-TARGET
something O
paqueñas O
and O
expensive O
price, O
given O
the O
times O
that O
run. O

Exquisite O
food B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
treatment. B-TARGET

A O
little O
expensive. O

Typical O
for O
tourists, O
deafening B-TARGET
shouting O
and O
unprofessional. O

<->I O
have O
not O
found O
anything O
negative O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time. O

<->I O
only O
ask O
them O
to O
continue O
the O
same O
and O
not O
to O
lower O
this O
extraordinary O
level O
of O
"excellence". O

<+>The O
extraordinary O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
, O
especially O
the O
fish B-TARGET
and O
seafood B-TARGET
. O

<+>The O
optimal O
homogeneity. O

<+>I O
have O
been O
many O
times, O
I O
have O
recommended O
it O
to O
family, O
friends O
and O
relatives O
and O
it O
has O
never O
let O
anyone O
down. O

<+>It O
is O
always O
just O
as O
"excellent". O

Too O
many O
tourists O
and, O
therefore, O
too O
much O
noise. O

In O
general O
it O
maintains O
the O
quality O
of O
its O
dishes B-TARGET
but O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list O
prices O
are O
too O
high. O

For O
my O
taste, O
the O
paella B-TARGET
del I-TARGET
moll I-TARGET
del I-TARGET
rellotge I-TARGET
is O
just O
right. O

A O
restaurant O
that O
I O
would O
qualify O
as O
a O
safe O
value O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
but O
can O
be O
improved O
in O
service B-TARGET
but O
without O
being O
disastrous O
far O
from O
being O
disastrous. O

The O
day O
you O
discover O
it O
becomes O
part O
of O
its O
decoration!!!! O

Very O
nice, O
impeccable O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
close, O
we O
had O
a O
great O
time. O

I O
had O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
a O
long O
time O
because O
of O
the O
good O
references O
I O
had O
received O
and O
I O
was O
not O
disappointed. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

No O
problem O
with O
the O
reservation O
made O
through O
this O
website. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
we O
ate O
very O
well, O
we O
enjoyed. O

Everything O
was O
as O
we O
expected O
and O
as O
we O
had O
been O
told, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere, O
definitely O
a O
restaurant O
to O
go O
when O
you O
want O
everyone O
to O
be O
happy. O

A O
good O
choice. O

Excellent O
restaurant O
with O
special O
attention B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Since O
the O
weather O
allowed O
it O
they O
reserved O
us O
a O
table O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
very O
well O
arranged O
and O
located. O

Highly O
recommended. O

Suitable O
for O
all O
ages O
but, O
in O
our O
opinion, O
advisable O
for O
over O
30 O
years O
and O
older, O
whether O
couples O
or O
groups. O

Ideal O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
a O
special O
event. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
of O
quality, O
although O
the O
price O
is O
high. O

<->Nothing O
to O
highlight O

<+> O
Unbeatable O
food B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

Excellent O
food, B-TARGET
but O
understaffed O
when O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
crowded. O

It O
took O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
bring O
the O
bill, O
ordered O
several O
times. O

I O
repeat, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

We O
have O
frequented O
this O
restaurant O
on O
several O
occasions. O

But O
today O
will O
be O
the O
last. O

The O
starters B-TARGET
were O
good, O
but O
I O
returned O
the O
rice B-TARGET
broth I-TARGET
because O
it O
had O
no O
flavor O
at O
all. O

They O
brought O
me O
another O
one O
and O
according O
to O
the O
waitress O
they O
changed O
an O
ingredient. O

(they O
put O
more O
salt). O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very, O
very O
bad. O

They O
poured O
the O
wine O
all O
over O
the O
table. O

We O
had O
not O
yet O
finished O
the O
starters O
and O
they O
were O
already O
coming O
to O
remove O
the O
plates O
to O
put O
the O
second O
one. O

It O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
wanted O
us O
to O
leave O
immediately, O
to O
fill O
the O
table O
again, O
and O
for O
dessert, O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
upstairs, O
there O
was O
a O
political O
event O
campaigning O
(with O
loudspeakers), O
which O
did O
not O
interest O
me O
in O
the O
least. O

Anyway, O
they O
charged O
me O
the O
same. O

I O
AM O
NOT O
COMING O
BACK. O

The O
rice B-TARGET
broth I-TARGET
did O
not O
have O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
good O
rice. O

Very O
weak. O

The O
rest O
was O
ok. O

The O
place B-TARGET
seemed O
to O
me O
very O
well O
located, O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
attention O
very O
good, O
as O
a O
suggestion O
a O
little O
more O
generosity O
in O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

I O
loved O
it O
and O
so O
did O
the O
three O
companions O
who O
accompanied O
me. O

The O
food, B-TARGET
the O
presentation B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
were O
very O
good. O

Exceptional O
food B-TARGET
and O
views. B-TARGET

The O
value O
for O
money O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
recommendable. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy O
with O
an O
impeccable O
taste. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
very O
fast. O

You O
hardly O
had O
to O
wait O
between O
courses. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
unbeatable, O
fresh, O
tender, O
the O
presentation B-TARGET
very O
original O
and O
creative. O

I O
loved O
it. O

Write O
your O
comment O
here... O

Everything O
was O
great! O

Everything O
was O
perfect, O
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
treatment! B-TARGET

Lights O
and O
shadows O
in O
my O
expected O
first O
visit O
to O
Meccano. B-TARGET

It O
is O
an O
original O
and O
attractive O
place, B-TARGET
but O
in O
short, O
and O
sticking O
to O
the O
food, B-TARGET
it O
is O
scarce O
in O
quantity O
and, O
in O
some O
of O
the O
dishes, O
in O
quality O
or, O
rather, O
in O
preparation. O

There O
were O
9 O
of O
us O
and O
we O
took O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
30€, O
a O
little O
bit O
modified. O

The O
cherry B-TARGET
gazpacho I-TARGET
was O
excellent, O
and O
one O
for O
each O
of O
us. O

Then O
came O
the O
"mussels B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
pickled I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
fried I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
olive I-TARGET
oil I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chips", I-TARGET
it O
sounded O
very O
good, O
but O
we O
were O
"surprised" O
with O
canned O
mussels O
in O
pickled O
sauce O
with O
potatoes O
matutano, O
to O
share O
three O
small O
plates. O

Were O
they O
bad? O

No, O
in O
fact O
they O
were O
good, O
but O
not O
what O
you O
expect O
in O
a O
tasting B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

I O
understand O
that O
there O
has O
to O
be O
more O
elaboration. B-TARGET

We O
continued O
with O
a O
croquette O
lottery. O

There O
were O
9 O
of O
us, O
and O
they O
brought O
out O
12 O
croquettes B-TARGET
... O
How O
do O
we O
eat O
1 O
croquette O
and O
1/3 O
each? O

It O
doesn't O
make O
sense. O

They O
were O
very O
good, O
though. O

We O
continued O
with O
the O
fried B-TARGET
baby I-TARGET
squid, I-TARGET
the O
stuffed B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
(excellent, O
but O
scarce), O
the O
eggs B-TARGET
Charly I-TARGET
and O
the O
Iberian B-TARGET
cheek, I-TARGET
all O
very O
good O
but O
again, O
LITTLE, O
VERY O
LITTLE, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
a O
foodie O
like O
us O
(and O
so O
we O
had O
announced O
it O
on O
the O
phone). O

They O
explained O
to O
us O
that O
they O
bring O
out O
1 O
dish O
every O
4 O
people, O
as O
a O
general O
rule. O

What O
if O
you O
are O
9, O
10 O
or O
11 O
people? O

Do O
you O
get O
the O
same O
as O
8? O

We O
let O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
know O
and, O
kindly O
(thank O
you), O
he O
gave O
us O
an O
extra O
portion O
of O
croquettes O
and O
another O
of O
eggs O
Charly, O
but O
still.... O

scarce. O

He O
told O
us O
that O
if O
we O
wanted O
more O
to O
ask, O
thanks O
again. O

Lastly, O
the O
finishing O
touch, O
a O
chocolate B-TARGET
coulant I-TARGET
the O
size O
of O
a O
flan O
and O
a O
little O
jar O
of O
cheese B-TARGET
the O
size O
of O
a O
yogurt... O
for O
the O
9 O
of O
us! O

Ridiculous, O
I'm O
sorry, O
but O
it's O
not O
normal O
to O
get O
one O
teaspoon O
per O
person. O

We O
said O
it O
again O
to O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
and O
he O
parked O
the O
kindness, O
despite O
his O
previous O
offer, O
passing O
to O
the O
rudeness O
that O
"that O
was O
so, O
and O
that O
we O
had O
already O
ordered O
too O
much", O
and O
that's O
it. O

I O
can O
agree O
with O
the O
substance O
of O
what O
he O
said, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
free O
buffet, O
but O
never O
in O
the O
forms, O
and O
less O
when O
15 O
minutes O
ago O
you O
have O
offered O
to O
take O
out O
more O
quantity O
if O
we O
wished. O

Finally, O
the B-TARGET
Drag I-TARGET
Queens I-TARGET
show, I-TARGET
well, O
it O
was O
scheduled O
for O
23:30 O
and O
they O
came O
out O
at O
1:00, O
so O
honestly O
we O
were O
not O
in O
the O
mood O
to O
watch O
it O
with O
pleasure. O

Not O
even O
with O
the O
wine O
ingested. O

I O
can O
understand O
30 O
minutes O
late, O
it O
was O
the O
Pilar O
festivities O
and O
so O
they O
make O
more O
money O
with O
the O
drinks, O
but O
1 O
hour O
and O
a O
half? O

That's O
not O
acceptable. O

I O
don't O
even O
wait O
1.30 O
hours O
for O
U2. O

Normal. O

Some O
laughter, O
but O
very O
normal. O

We O
left O
during O
the O
break. O

In O
summary: O
the O
best, O
because O
excellent O
red O
wine B-TARGET
included O
(Viñas O
del O
Vero O
and O
Pago O
Ayles), O
coffees B-TARGET
and O
shots B-TARGET
also O
within O
the O
menu, O
and O
some O
original O
dishes O
(cherry B-TARGET
gazpacho) I-TARGET
and O
good O
(eggs B-TARGET
Charly, I-TARGET
squid, I-TARGET
pasta, B-TARGET
cheeks). B-TARGET

The O
worst: O
general O
scarcity, O
some O
weak O
dishes O
(those O
mussels B-TARGET
...) O
and O
a O
reply O
from O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
that O
we O
did O
not O
like O
very O
much. O

The O
waitress, B-TARGET
by O
the O
way, O
was O
very O
kind O
at O
all O
times. O

Thank O
you. O

A O
subsequent O
visit? O

I O
would O
have O
to O
think O
about O
it O
a O
lot. O

Best O
regards. O

I O
have O
written O
down O
LA B-TARGET
DESPENSA I-TARGET
not O
to O
go, O
unless O
the O
owner O
reads O
the O
review O
and O
wants O
to O
defend O
himself, O
now O
I O
am O
surprised O
that O
he O
can O
defend O
himself O
if O
he O
laughs O
at O
everyone O
who O
goes O
to O
his O
place, O
he O
will O
never O
know O
who O
is O
a O
good O
customer O
or O
a O
bad O
one. O

Well, O
I'm O
sorry O
I O
didn't O
read O
your O
comment O
before O
Pedro, O
because O
I O
would O
have O
saved O
myself O
this O
accident, O
we O
saw O
the O
"list" B-TARGET
that O
you O
mention O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
some O
prices O
we O
realized O
that O
they O
were O
also O
a O
robbery, O
as O
you O
say, O
I O
do O
not O
plan O
to O
return. O

I O
visited O
Scala O
about O
a O
year O
ago. O

I O
was O
invited O
to O
this O
restaurant O
of O
which O
I O
was O
unaware O
of O
its O
existence. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
entered O
I O
was O
surprised, O
making O
a O
good O
impression. O

Completely O
new O
premises, B-TARGET
white O
walls, O
everything O
very O
clean O
and O
modern. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
correct O
throughout O
the O
meal. O

Perhaps O
too O
distant. O

As O
for O
the O
products, B-TARGET
I O
was O
not O
completely O
pleased O
with O
them. O

They O
were O
not O
bad O
and O
the O
quantity O
was O
correct, O
but O
I O
was O
not O
100% O
satisfied. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
quite O
cold, O
something O
was O
missing O
in O
that O
room. O

In O
spite O
of O
this, O
we O
left O
happy. O

I O
will O
try O
to O
repeat O
and O
see O
if O
they O
improve. O

We O
have O
returned O
today, O
Tuesday O
June O
18, O
2013, O
after O
about O
a O
year, O
for O
a O
celebration, O
and O
the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
site, B-TARGET
is O
that: O
"you O
always O
get O
it O
right". O

You O
can O
not O
put O
another. O

We O
had O
a O
wonderful O
meal O
with O
exquisite O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
a O
careful O
elaboration, O
the O
service B-TARGET
in O
its O
right O
measure O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
staff; I-TARGET
the O
authors O
of O
the O
delights O
that O
come O
out O
to O
the O
table: O
A O
standing O
ovation, O
the O
return O
to O
the O
ring O
and O
the O
two O
ears. O

More O
than O
another O
"cachirulo" O
I O
suggest O
to O
the O
author O
of O
this O
blog, O
the O
brand O
"siempre O
aciertas". O

Best O
regards O
and O
..... O

we O
will O
be O
back!!!! O

(and O
we O
are O
neither O
family O
nor O
friends O
of O
the O
owners, O
but O
people O
who O
value O
a O
job O
well O
done. O

The O
author O
of O
the O
blog O
knows O
it O
well). O

All O
very O
well O
both O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
of O
the O
service, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
very O
rich O
and O
served O
in O
a O
short O
time O
and O
the O
value O
for O
money O
very O
well O
too. O

100% O
recommendable. O

Very O
good. O

Very O
good. O

All O
ok. O

Everything O
was O
perfect, O
since O
they O
had O
our O
reservation B-TARGET
and O
the O
table B-TARGET
we O
had O
asked O
for, O
next O
to O
the O
window O
overlooking O
Las O
Ramblas. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast. O

They O
applied O
the O
discount. O

20% O
discount O
on O
the O
bill, O
no O
problem. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
passable, O
at O
least O
what O
we O
ate: O
patatas B-TARGET
bravas I-TARGET
and O
two O
pizzas. B-TARGET

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
good. O

We O
were O
already O
going O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
having O
pizza O
for O
dinner, O
and O
we O
were O
surprised O
to O
see O
that O
there O
was O
little O
variety B-TARGET
... O

In O
general O
everything O
was O
good, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
is O
rather O
passable.... O

The O
bathroom B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
disaster... O

Yes O
it O
is O
true O
that O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
precisely O
for O
that O
reason O
they O
should O
be O
more O
rigorous O
in O
the O
cleaning O
of O
the O
bathrooms. B-TARGET

The O
food O
was O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money, O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

We O
were O
in O
the O
upstairs O
and O
going O
with O
children O
was O
great O
because O
there O
was O
more O
space. B-TARGET

Greetings, O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

Very O
nice O
and O
helpful!!! O

Highly O
recommended O

To O
repeat O

Very O
correct O

Excellent O
reform B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
food B-TARGET
with O
a O
very O
interesting O
price.... O

Crazy O
resentful O
not O
allowed O
to O
enter... O

Great O
celebrations O
of O
friends O
with O
the O
owner B-TARGET
very O
affectionate O
in O
the O
treatment.... O

An O
appropriate O
comment O
for O
the O
restaurant O
El O
Candelas: O
It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
people O
who O
are O
used O
to O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
by O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
of O
all O
categories, O
it O
costs O
us O
so O
much O
to O
find O
a O
place O
like O
this, O
where O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
extraordinary, O
either O
the O
daily B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
which O
is O
of O
excellent O
quality O
and O
variety, O
as O
its O
letter B-TARGET
, O
not O
very O
wide O
but O
very O
careful, O
along O
with O
a O
grilled B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
16 O
Euros O
that O
is O
a O
real O
gem, O
consisting O
of O
a O
wonderful O
illustrated B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
a O
plate O
of O
black O
pudding, O
sausage O
and O
sausage O
grilled O
sausage, O
a O
cheese O
plate, O
and O
choose O
between O
an O
excellent O
beef O
entrecote B-TARGET
or O
4 O
pieces O
of O
grilled B-TARGET
veal I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
Aragon, I-TARGET
dessert O
and O
wine O
of O
the O
area, O
simply O
great! O
. O

I O
forgot, O
we O
can O
also O
taste O
the O
best O
beef B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
from O
Navarra O
that O
you O
can O
find O
in O
Zaragoza, O
I O
can O
not O
fail O
to O
comment O
also O
its O
extensive O
wine B-TARGET
list O
that O
in O
a O
family O
restaurant O
like O
this O
you O
do O
not O
expect O
to O
find O
such O
quality, O
do O
not O
fail O
to O
visit O
it O
and O
I'm O
sure O
you O
will O
thank O
me O
later, O
I O
tell O
you O
a O
person O
with O
over O
40 O
years O
of O
experience O
in O
hospitality, O
mainly O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
sure O
that O
Ana B-TARGET
its I-TARGET
owner I-TARGET
will O
receive O
you O
with O
open O
arms O
and O
kindness O
along O
with O
his O
great O
interest O
in O
the O
customer O
to O
leave O
with O
a O
big O
smile O
and O
desire O
to O
return. O

Congratulations O
you O
have O
a O
great O
restaurant. B-TARGET
We O
had O
a O
wonderful O
dinner. O

We O
hope O
to O
see O
you O
again. O

Great O
value O
for O
money. O

High O
quality O
home O
cooking. B-TARGET

Super O
friendly O
treatment. B-TARGET

Do O
not O
stop O
behaving O
like O
this. O

A O
hug O
and O
until O
next O
time. O

We O
were O
dining O
on O
Saturday O
four O
people O
with O
a O
fairly O
correct O
treatment. B-TARGET

Homemade O
food, O
and O
everything O
as O
a O
family. O

We O
ate O
a O
la O
carte O
tasting O
their O
tripe, O
steak, O
quail O
etc.. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
if O
the O
tomato O
wasn't O
cold O
from O
the O
fridge O
it O
would O
have O
much O
more O
flavor. O

For O
dessert B-TARGET
we O
tried O
a O
mushroom O
ice O
cream O
that O
was O
good. O

Write O

Hello O
Mr. O

In O

About O
your O

what O

Greetings. O

Lately O
I O
do O
not O
let O
a O
special O
meal O
go O
by O
without O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

From O
the O
management, B-TARGET
through O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
waiters, B-TARGET
the O
treatment O
is O
excellent, O
but O
all O
this O
would O
be O
useless O
without O
also, O
as O
it O
is O
so. O

enjoy O
a O
very O
good O
quality O
in O
the O
product B-TARGET
and O
an O
unbeatable O
value O
for O
money. O

Congratulations O
and O
thanks O
for O
your O
work. O

Everything O
very O
well, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
perfect O
if O
some O
of O
the O
steaks B-TARGET
were O
more O
on O
point, O
because O
they O
were O
served O
too O
much O
overdone. O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
correct O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
with O
good O
preparation O
and O
presentation. O

Something O
weak O
in O
desserts. B-TARGET

All O
very O
good. O

It O
is O
the O
1st O
time O
I O
have O
been O
there O
and O
I O
find O
it O
very O
pleasant. O

Service B-TARGET
and O
restoration O
are O
good. O

I O
will O
recommend O
it O
to O
friends. O

We O
were O
very O
well O
served O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great. O

The O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
correct. O

The O
ambience B-TARGET
was O
sad. O

They O
serve O
you O
too O
fast O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
play O
and O
talk O
while. O

The O
seconds B-TARGET
were O
good. O

The O
first B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
snack I-TARGET
very O
weak, O
fritters B-TARGET
full O
of O
thorns O
and O
bitter O
seitons. B-TARGET

I O
will O
not O
return. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
you O
can O
tell O
they O
have O
good O
cooks. O

The O
education O
of O
the O
director, B-TARGET
Fernando O
Nieto, O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
it O
is O
not O
logical O
that O
while O
one O
enjoys O
his O
food, O
he O
is O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
eat, O
and O
he O
scolds O
the O
waiters O
in O
the O
dining O
room, O
where O
all O
the O
customers O
hear O
his O
shouts. O

The O
metres, B-TARGET
two O
scarecrows, O
are O
useless. O

It O
is O
no O
longer O
L'Olivé O
on O
Muntaner O
street. O

It O
has O
become O
too O
mechanized O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
suffer O
from O
it. O

Yes O
but O
no, O
would O
be O
the O
final O
summary. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
like O
the O
top O
of O
a O
pine O
tree. O

Great O
decoration, B-TARGET
great O
food B-TARGET
and O
at O
a O
not O
exaggerated O
price. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
fantastic. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
unmatched, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
but O
the O
most O
unpleasant O
thing O
is O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Fernando B-TARGET
Nieto I-TARGET
treat O
his O
staff O
so O
badly. O

Excellent O
value O
for O
money. O

You O
will O
like O
it O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
look O
good, O
you O
will O
get O
it. O

For O
me O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants B-TARGET
in O
Barcelona O
of O
Mediterranean O
and O
Catalan O
cuisine. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
unbeatable. O

Undoubtedly O
the O
best. O

hello. O

the O
truth O
is O
that O
we O
ate O
really O
well O
and O
it O
was O
not O
expensive. O

the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
complete O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
great. O

I O
recommend O
it O
without O
a O
doubt. O

food B-TARGET
with O
correct O
quality O
and O
in O
the O
right O
proportion O
and O
price O
ay, O
ay, O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
complete O
and O
good, O
efficient O
professional O
service. B-TARGET

But: O
decoration O
and O
atmosphere B-TARGET
almost O
retro, O
charge O
for O
bread B-TARGET
that O
I O
did O
not O
order O
and O
service O
2.20 O
€ O
per O
person, O
coca B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
3.20 O
€ O
excessive, O
coffees B-TARGET
at O
2 O
€, O
all O
plus O
tax, O
urinal B-TARGET
service O
men O
with O
graffiti, O
I O
will O
not O
repeat. O

Honestly, O
I O
found O
it O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
ate. O

The O
service B-TARGET
certainly O
needs O
to O
be O
improved. O

Among O
other O
things O
I O
have O
an O
obsession O
with O
the O
hurry B-TARGET
that O
some O
have O
to O
remove O
the O
dishes O
from O
the O
table O
while O
you O
are O
eating. O

L'Olive O
should O
not O
make O
these O
mistakes. O

Splendid O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
magnificent O
staff. B-TARGET

ideal O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
perfect O
food. B-TARGET

highly O
recommended O

Little O
space O
between O
tables B-TARGET
for O
a O
high O
priced O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Poor O
lighting. B-TARGET

The O
stairs O
and O
details O
of O
the O
furniture, B-TARGET
dusty O
and O
worn, O
need O
renovation. O

Good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
detail O
of O
the O
starter, B-TARGET
which O
they O
charge.... O

I O
really O
like O
their O
food, B-TARGET
I've O
been O
there O
several O
times, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
number O
of O
tables B-TARGET
is O
excessive O
for O
the O
space O
available. O

The O
neighbor O
eats O
at O
your O
table... O
Privacy, B-TARGET
zero. O

I O
see O
that O
the O
opinions O
are O
mostly O
favorable, O
however, O
I O
did O
not O
like O
it. O

I O
went O
with O
a O
company O
group, O
we O
were O
cramped O
and O
they O
took O
forever O
to O
serve O
us O
and O
charged O
us O
as O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
first O
class. O

The O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
the O
treatment, B-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
quantity O
can O
be O
qualified O
as O
very O
good. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
can O
be O
a O
little O
expensive O
but O
you O
leave O
with O
the O
feeling O
of O
having O
eaten O
well O
and O
quite O
a O
lot. O

It O
perfectly O
combines O
quality, O
service B-TARGET
and O
ambience. B-TARGET

Highly O
recommendable. O

Hello O
we O
were O
on O
Saturday O
and O
it O
is O
really O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
dined, O
plus O
the O
menu O
we O
booked O
at O
the O
time O
the O
tasting O
menu O
B O
(26 O
euros O
per O
person) O
did O
not O
have O
it, O
we O
were O
told O
that O
there O
was O
another O
of O
29 O
euros, O
but O
that O
several O
dishes O
were O
missing, O
which O
made O
us O
choose O
the O
35 O
euros O
with O
glass O
included, O
although O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
well O
prepared O
the O
price O
in O
our O
view O
is O
high O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
for O
two O
people O
scarce. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
concerned, O
it O
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
performance B-TARGET
of O
a O
drag O
queen O
very O
entertaining, O
we O
do O
not O
rule O
out O
returning O
but O
only O
to O
have O
a O
drink O
and O
enjoy O
the O
music. O

A O
very O
expensive O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
what O
it O
offers. O

We O
had O
a O
salad, O
croquettes O
and O
Charly's O
eggs, O
all O
to O
share, O
without O
dessert, O
and O
the O
joke O
cost O
us O
25 O
Euros O
per O
person...in O
any O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
can O
eat O
better O
for O
less...And O
the O
show? O

We O
arrived O
at O
21,45h O
(for O
dinner) O
and O
left O
at O
23,30h O
more O
or O
less, O
well, O
during O
all O
that O
time O
there O
was O
no O
show O
at O
all...so O
where O
is O
the O
dinner-show B-TARGET
that O
they O
advertise? O

Wow, O
a O
fiasco...I O
don't O
think O
we'll O
be O
back. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET

We O
had O
dinner O
with O
12 O
work O
colleagues O
on O
Friday O
night O
and O
we O
took O
the O
20 O
€ O
menu. O

Everything O
was O
fantastic, O
good O
portions, B-TARGET
quality O
of O
the O
food, B-TARGET
well O
served O
and O
all O
in O
a O
very O
cute, O
small O
and O
cozy O
place. B-TARGET

We O
were O
almost O
alone O
and O
we O
were O
very O
comfortable. O

With O
coffees, O
extra O
wine O
and O
drinks O
in O
the O
end O
it O
came O
out O
to O
30 O
€. O

We O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
correct O
and O
attentive. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
small O
but O
very O
cozy. O

We O
enjoyed O
a O
good O
meal B-TARGET
at O
a O
good O
price. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
slow. O

Only O
with O
the O
first O
course, O
it O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
serve O
it O
and O
another O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
serve O
the O
second O
course.... O

We O
liked O
it O
quite O
a O
lot, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
but O
the O
quality-price O
is O
a O
bit O
expensive. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
itself O
is O
very O
good O
although O
sometimes O
you O
can O
smell O
the O
smell O
of O
sewage O
from O
the O
street. O

They O
do O
their O
best O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
don't O
notice O
it. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
were O
ok. O

The O
downside O
was O
that O
we O
booked O
on O
a O
Friday O
at O
22:30 O
(they O
allowed O
reservations O
until O
23:00) O
and O
as O
we O
were O
the O
only O
reservation O
for O
that O
night O
they O
called O
me O
that O
evening O
to O
see O
if O
we O
could O
go O
at O
21:00. O

If O
they O
do O
not O
have O
much O
affluence O
in O
the O
evenings O
it O
would O
be O
better O
not O
to O
give O
the O
option O
to O
book. O

Otherwise O
as O
I O
indicated O
in O
the O
beginning O
the O
treatment O
was O
good. O

Very O
bad O
smell O
in O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Poor O
wine B-TARGET
list. I-TARGET

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
too O
small O
but O
with O
a O
certain O
charm. O

I O
organized O
the O
department O
meal O
and O
I O
am O
more O
than O
satisfied O
and O
grateful. O

Both O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
cook B-TARGET
were O
exceptional. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
tasty O
and O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
noticeable O
and O
tasty O
in O
all O
of O
them. O

We O
ordered O
one O
of O
the O
menus O
they O
have O
prepared O
and O
we O
were O
not O
mistaken. O

Also O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
the O
hours O
flew O
by... O
we O
almost O
had O
dinner O
because O
of O
how O
good O
we O
felt O
there. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
those O
who O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
celebrate O
a O
meal O
with O
friends O
or O
work O
and O
also O
to O
couples O
as O
it O
is O
a O
quiet O
and O
pleasant O
place B-TARGET
with O
simple O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
high O
quality. O

We O
loved O
it; O
very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
friendly, O
helpful, O
... O
if O
you O
can O
eat O
at O
the O
table O
of O
the O
window O
overlooking O
the O
square, O
it O
is O
ideal. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
quiet, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

When O
I O
return O
to O
Barcelona O
I O
will O
repeat. O

Very O
cozy, O
as O
if O
you O
were O
at O
home. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
pleasant O
service. B-TARGET

Somewhat O
expensive, O
but O
the O
menu B-TARGET
has O
enough O
variety O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
good. O

We O
will O
repeat! O

We O
had O
dinner O
on O
Wednesday O
night O
with O
a O
group O
of O
4 O
friends O
and O
we O
all O
loved O
it. O

Very O
cozy, O
exquisite O
and O
excellent O
treatment. B-TARGET

In O
addition, O
we O
had O
not O
been O
to O
this O
area O
of O
Barcelona O
in O
the O
Born O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
and O
now O
it O
has O
become O
incredibly O
beautiful. O

Fantastic O
choice. O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
magnificent O
experience, O
unbeatable O
service, B-TARGET
the O
recommendations O
of O
the O
restaurant O
manager B-TARGET
acertadisimas, O
a O
delicious O
wine. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
that O
anyone O
who O
wants O
a O
good O
meal B-TARGET
should O
put O
themselves O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
maitre O
d'. O

Very O
good. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
we O
have O
dined O
sincerely O
well. O

Thank O
you. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
thanks O
to O
super O
friendly O
and O
professional O
waiters. B-TARGET

Fantastic. O

The O
Restaurant B-TARGET
very O
cozy, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
excellent. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much. O

Nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

After O
dinner O
we O
continued O
with O
the O
good O
cocktails. B-TARGET

Total O
4 O
hours O
very O
well O
spent. O

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
interesting O
decoration, B-TARGET
good O
food O
(quality O
of O
the O
food). B-TARGET

Insufficient O
quantity, O
dogs O
are O
not O
allowed O
as O
in O
most O
restaurants O
in O
other O
countries. O

In O
a O
few O
months O
they O
have O
gone O
from O
abundant O
and O
excellent O
food O
to O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
small O
portions O
at O
the O
same O
price. O

The O
wines B-TARGET
have O
gone O
up O
in O
price O
by O
about O
30%. O

What O
a O
pity, O
it O
has O
gone O
from O
being O
a O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
to O
one O
more O
of O
the O
pile. O

They O
have O
also O
substituted O
the O
complimentary O
shot O
of O
what O
you O
wanted O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
cava. O

Someone O
thought O
that O
by O
subtracting O
food B-TARGET
and O
drink B-TARGET
and O
raising O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
no O
one O
would O
notice, O
but O
the O
clientele O
is O
not O
stupid. O

Very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
next O
to O
the O
Born O
market. O

Good O
portions B-TARGET
of O
first O
to O
share O
and O
superb O
center O
of O
grilled B-TARGET
hake. I-TARGET

The O
bill O
40 O
euros O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
rioja O
reserva, O
highly O
recommended. O

A O
good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
very O
good O
value O
for O
money, O
local B-TARGET
decoration, O
low O
but O
sufficient O
light B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
well O
selected O
piped B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

Ideal O
for O
a O
dinner O
as O
a O
couple. O

The O
beef B-TARGET
tenderloin I-TARGET
is O
impressive, O
very O
good O
quality O
meat B-TARGET
and O
just O
at O
the O
point O
we O
asked O
for O
it. O

And O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

To O
put O
a O
downside O
I O
would O
say O
that O
if O
you O
are O
not O
a O
lover O
of O
Rioja B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
you O
do O
not O
have O
much O
more O
to O
choose O
from, O
even O
so O
the O
selection O
of O
Riojas O
is O
good. O

We O
will O
repeat. O

Yesterday O
we O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
had O
a O
very O
intimate O
and O
cozy O
decoration. O

The O
attention B-TARGET
from O
the O
staff O
was O
quite O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
phenomenal. O

We O
will O
repeat O
for O
sure. O

Site B-TARGET
recommended. O

Well O
elaborated O
food. B-TARGET

I O
had O
a O
monkfish B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
and O
my O
friends O
who O
had O
meat B-TARGET
were O
delighted. O

We O
extended O
the O
dinner O
until O
three O
o'clock O
having O
drinks. O

Pleasant O
evening, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Greetings O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
impressive. O

We O
found O
the O
food B-TARGET
unoriginal, O
and O
there O
was O
too O
much O
potato O
in O
each O
dish. O

One O
of O
the O
dishes O
they O
forgot O
to O
put O
the O
garnish O
that O
was O
on O
the O
menu. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
very O
fast, O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
were O
very O
close O
together O
and O
every O
time O
the O
waiter O
passed O
by O
they O
hit O
our O
chairs. O

I O
would O
not O
go O
there O
again O
for O
dinner, O
but O
I O
recommend O
it O
for O
drinks. O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day O
and O
although O
the O
first O
course O
(riggatoni B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
la I-TARGET
bolognese) I-TARGET
seemed O
a O
bit O
meager O
(very O
good, O
but O
little O
quantity), O
the O
second O
course O
was O
supplemented O
with O
a O
good O
plate O
of O
meat O
and O
together O
with O
the O
dessert, O
we O
left O
the O
restaurant O
well O
satiated. O

Both O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
and O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
was O
impeccable, O
so O
we O
left O
with O
a O
great O
feeling. O

I O
totally O
recommend O
it O

Last O
Saturday O
we O
tried O
to O
celebrate O
Christmas O
dinner O
with O
our O
team. O

The O
experience O
was O
terrible. O

I'll O
explain O
it O
now O
so O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
read O
everything O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
even O
to O
an O
enemy. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
agreed O
and O
paid O
in O
part O
in O
advance O
did O
not O
correspond O
to O
what O
they O
served O
("it O
was O
a O
mistake," O
they O
said O
when O
we O
complained). O

The O
food B-TARGET
they O
served O
was O
scarce O
in O
quantity, O
served O
without O
style O
or O
affection O
and O
we O
had O
to O
endure O
that O
they O
served O
pieces O
of O
meat B-TARGET
completely O
frozen, O
unfinished O
cooking. O

The O
desserts, B-TARGET
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
miniature O
contest. O

They O
say O
they O
were O
good, O
but O
I O
didn't O
try O
them O
because O
there O
were O
fewer O
desserts B-TARGET
than O
people.... O

The O
drink B-TARGET
has O
left O
to O
be O
desired O
in O
every O
way, O
it O
has O
been O
little O
and O
has O
not O
even O
included O
beers, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
an O
extra O
(not O
small, O
because O
it O
is O
not O
cheap) O
to O
finish O
the O
menu O
with O
liquid O
to O
make O
down O
a O
"risotto" O
that O
would O
have O
delighted O
the O
presenter O
of O
Bricomania, O
in O
the O
chapter O
in O
which O
he O
explains O
how O
to O
batter O
old O
walls. O

And O
the O
best O
thing O
(with O
all O
the O
irony O
I O
am O
capable O
of O
without O
being O
insulting) O
was O
the O
service. B-TARGET

They O
have O
tried O
to O
charge O
us O
more O
menus O
than O
we O
consumed, O
they O
have O
not O
proposed O
any O
compensation O
to O
correct O
the O
long O
list O
of O
errors O
that O
they O
have O
recognized O
and O
now O
we O
do O
not O
even O
get O
them O
to O
send O
us O
the O
bill O
with O
the O
total O
of O
the O
"party". O

A O
whole O
list O
of O
inanities O
that O
have O
turned O
our O
Christmas O
dinner O
into O
an O
episode O
of O
Nightmare O
in O
the O
Kitchen. O

If O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
get O
bitter O
unnecessarily, O
try O
any O
other O
restaurant O
in O
the O
area. O

No O
matter O
how O
bad O
it O
is, O
it O
will O
be O
better O
than O
this O
one. O

Sincere O
and O
cordial O
greetings. O

[...] O
street O
level O
and O
two O
restaurants O
on O
the O
upper O
floor, O
accessed O
by O
stairs. O

One O
restaurant O
is O
Colette O
and O
the O
other O
is O
Q-Art. O

The O
Colette O
is O
identified O
by O
its O
creators O
as O
"haute O
cuisine O
[...]". O

Thanks O
for O
the O
clarification O
Pedro, O
if O
they O
only O
use O
this O
trend O
in O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
dish O
I O
don't O
mind, O
if O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
they O
use O
genetically O
altered O
products O
I O
would O
not O
be O
so O
thankful, O
which O
seems O
not O
to O
be O
the O
case. O

From O
what O
you O
tell O
me O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
with O
good O
food. O

I O
left O
very O
burned O
from O
my O
visit O
to O
q-art, O
but O
your O
review O
makes O
me O
rethink O
the O
possibility O
of O
going O
to O
Colette. O

Best O
regards. O

I O
had O
dinner O
at O
Colette O
the O
other O
day O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
like O
this O
was O
needed O
in O
Zaragoza. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
impressive, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
the O
same O
and O
the O
attention O
with O
so O
many O
appetizers O
is O
not O
even O
normal O
good, O
it O
is O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
to O
all O
friends. O

I O
love O
this O
place, B-TARGET
which O
in O
general O
does O
not O
disappoint, O
but O
on O
Saturday O
it O
did: O
they O
gave O
me O
a O
table O
for O
3 O
and O
then, O
4 O
hours O
later, O
they O
canceled O
it O
and O
bounced O
me O
to O
RISKOMAR, O
where O
we O
ate O
terribly O
(I O
have O
already O
left O
my O
opinion). O

It O
is O
not O
very O
serious O
that O
they O
confirm O
availability O
and O
then O
cancel O
it O
and O
send O
you O
to O
another O
restaurant O
in O
the O
group. O

Disappointment, O
as O
it O
was O
in O
the O
past O
when O
the O
waitress O
did O
not O
know O
MOSKOSCAYA O
vodka. O

In O
my O
opinion O
it O
is O
an O
impressive O
restaurant, B-TARGET
both O
in O
decoration, B-TARGET
comfort B-TARGET
and, O
of O
course, O
in O
service B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

The O
latter O
is O
the O
best O
of O
all O
both O
in O
staging O
and O
in O
quality O
and O
quantity, O
here O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
topic O
of O
going O
to O
eat O
a O
sandwich O
because O
you O
stay O
hungry. O

to O
recommend, O
my O
score O
is O
ten. O

The O
first O
impression O
when O
you O
enter O
is O
very O
positive. O

Good O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
staging. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
NOT O
AMAZING. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
par. O

The O
only O
thing O
really O
high O
is O
the O
price. O

My O
grade O
would O
be O
7. O

They O
need O
to O
improve O
if O
they O
want O
to O
keep O
charging O
that. O

That O
in O
allusion O
to O
the O
comments O
of O
someone O
pretending O
to O
be O
me O
using O
my O
name O
and O
criticizing O
this O
restaurant. O

I O
let O
it O
be O
known O
that O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
their O
opinions. O

Colette O
Restaurant. O

DisappointingOn O
the O
occasion O
of O
a O
trip O
to O
Zaragoza O
we O
dined, O
advised O
by O
the O
hotel, O
in O
the O
restaurant O
Colette. O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
of O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
wants O
to O
be O
pretentious O
and O
that O
is O
far O
from O
being O
the O
innovative O
and O
quality O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
they O
advertise. O

The O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
very O
poor. O

Surprisingly, O
they O
also O
charge O
you O
for O
the O
sweets B-TARGET
that O
they O
serve O
with O
the O
coffee O
and O
that O
we O
had O
not O
requested. O

It O
is O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
not O
to O
remember O
and O
not O
to O
advise. O

The O
ambience B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
would O
be O
the O
only O
thing O
to O
highlight. O

As O
for O
the O
food, B-TARGET
fine O
but O
nothing O
exclusive O
or O
surprising. O

In O
Zaragoza O
there O
are O
many O
restaurants O
with O
the O
same O
quality O
and O
even O
better. O

What O
is O
really O
unfortunate O
is O
the O
service B-TARGET
they O
offer: O

- O
they O
took O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
bring O
us O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine, O
after O
having O
asked O
three O
waitresses B-TARGET
for O
it O
. O

- O
As O
soon O
as O
the O
bread O
is O
used O
up, O
they O
don't O
bring O
out O
any O
more, O
no O
matter O
how O
much O
you O
ask O
and O
insist O
- O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
treated O
us O
pitifully, O
even O
shouting O
at O
us O
and O
demanding O
silence O
(there O
were O
fifteen O
of O
us, O
so O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
murmuring O
is O
normal). O

Honestly, O
it O
was O
the O
worst O
service B-TARGET
I O
have O
ever O
been O
offered, O
and O
that, O
in O
a O
restaurant O
like O
this, O
is O
unforgivable. O

They O
looked O
like O
tavern O
waitresses O
in O
a O
three O
forks O
restaurant. O

I O
DO O
NOT O
RECOMMEND O
IT. O

We O
have O
been O
three O
times O
in O
the O
spa, O
and O
we O
think O
it's O
great, O
comfortable O
rooms, O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
waters O
are O
very O
beneficial O
for O
people O
with O
skin O
or O
respiratory O
problems, O
we O
will O
return. O

thanks O
for O
the O
kindness O
of O
all O
the O
workers B-TARGET

<->The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
slow, O
especially O
for O
groups O
that O
work O
with O
a O
very O
strict O
schedule. O

<->The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
nevertheless O
very O
friendly. O

<+>The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
the O
rice O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excellent O
in O
general. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
impressive O
and O
with O
very O
good O
prices. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
exquisite O
and O
plentiful. O

The O
truth O
a O
good O
option O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona O
to O
enjoy O
a O
good O
dinner. O

We O
were O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
and O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
lot, O
we O
will O
be O
back. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
you O
and O
on O
Saturday O
5,09 O
I O
was O
having O
dinner O
with O
the O
Singles O
Bcn O
group O
and O
it O
was O
a O
real O
disaster, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
was O
not O
fulfilled O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
"horrendous" O
I O
would O
almost O
say O
bordering O
on O
rude, O
it O
was O
a O
shame, O
the O
whole O
group O
at O
the O
table O
was O
left O
without O
wanting O
to O
return. O

On O
Sunday O
we O
were O
eating O
with O
the O
family O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
children I-TARGET
is O
appreciated O
because O
it O
is O
complete O
and O
at O
a O
good O
price, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
rice O
very O
well O
as O
well O
as O
desserts. B-TARGET

The O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
was O
impeccable O
at O
all O
times. O

Excellent O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona, O
A O
lobster B-TARGET
paella I-TARGET
that O
we O
will O
remember O
as O
well O
as O
good O
wines B-TARGET
very O
well. O

Quiet O
pleasant O
and O
children O
do O
not O
bother O
with O
a O
successful O
children's O
menu B-TARGET
a O
good O
choice O
for O
the O
whole O
family. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
group O
having O
dinner O
last O
Saturday O
and O
everything O
was O
perfect, O
food, B-TARGET
service, B-TARGET
atmosphere. B-TARGET

The O
value O
for O
money O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
unpalatable. O

Clueless B-TARGET
waiters: I-TARGET
we O
had O
to O
share O
a O
rice O
dish O
because O
we O
were O
4 O
and O
3 O
of O
them O
were O
ordered, O
they O
brought O
the O
bill O
from O
another O
table, O
discussions O
between O
waiters... O

Correct O
food. B-TARGET

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
last O
Friday O
and O
we O
were O
greeted O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
rosé O
cava, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
varied O
and O
we O
really O
liked O
a O
sea O
bass B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
salt I-TARGET
that O
was O
recommended O
to O
us, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
very O
nice. O

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
desserts I-TARGET
was O
exquisite. O

I O
booked O
for O
1.01.07 O
and O
when O
I O
arrived O
they O
didn't O
have O
my O
reservation. O

Neither O
mine O
nor O
that O
of O
some O
gentlemen O
who O
arrived O
earlier. O

Neither O
mine O
nor O
that O
of O
some O
gentlemen O
who O
arrived O
earlier. O

They O
didn't O
tell O
us O
that O
the O
menu O
was O
closed O
that O
day. O

We O
left O
without O
eating. O

I O
have O
been O
several O
times O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
several O
reasons: O
good O
value O
for O
money, O
fast O
and O
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
location B-TARGET
(near O
Pl.Urquinaona) O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
exquisite. O

Totally O
recommended O
for O
any O
event: O
family, O
friends O
and O
couples. O

The O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
make O
a O
proposal O
for O
improvement: O
The O
waiters B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
were O
too O
stressed O
and O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
serve O
us, O
so O
maybe O
if O
they O
put O
another O
waiter O
or O
the O
kitchen-room B-TARGET
logistics I-TARGET
system I-TARGET
was O
better O
designed, O
customers O
would O
be O
served O
more O
promptly. O

<->Heat O

I O

Not O

hungry. O

With O
the O
50% O

it O

a O

Very O

I O
think O
the O

says O
it O
all. O

Reservation O
for O
2 O
people O
at O
14,30. O

Menu O
+ O
glass O
of O
cava. O

We O
arrived O
punctually. O

Considerable O
wait B-TARGET
standing O
(long O
queue). O

Attempt O
to O
look O
up O
and O
down O
for O
a O
free O
table. O

In O
the O
end O
they O
found O
one O
by O
chance O
in O
an O
uncomfortable O
corner. B-TARGET

Above O
my O
head O
was O
the O
TV O
screen O
with O
the O
sound B-TARGET
in O
my O
left O
ear. O

The O
table O
had O
to O
be O
reserved. O

We O
chose O
a O
la O
carte O
dishes. O

I O
order O
Raimat O
Chardonay O
wine. O

The O
waiter O
asks O
me O
if O
white O
or O
red O
(?). O

I O
tell O
him O
that O
chardonnay O
is O
a O
white O
grape O
variety. O

My O
first O
dish O
(huevos B-TARGET
estrellados) I-TARGET
was O
simply O
fried O
potatoes O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
fried O
eggs O
on O
top O
(without O
a O
care O
in O
the O
world). O

We O
are O
at O
home O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
way. O

My O
wife O
ordered O
a O
shrimp O
salad. O

Three O
or O
four O
fried O
prawns O
on O
top O
of O
arugula. O

For O
the O
main O
course, O
we O
both O
ordered O
salt O
sea O
bass. O

They O
don't O
have O
any. O

They O
offer O
hake O
with O
sauce. O

A O
deep O
dish O
full O
of O
liquid O
with O
two O
small O
pieces O
of O
fish O
(my O
wife O
complained O
that O
it O
was O
not O
hake B-TARGET
and O
whatever O
it O
was O
was O
super O
frozen). O

No O
value O
for O
money. O

We O
asked O
about O
the O
glass O
of O
cava O
offered O
in O
the O
reservation. O

The O
waiter O
had O
no O
idea. O

He O
alerts O
the O
maitre O
d' O
(I O
think) O
and O
he O
tells O
us O
that O
"well", O
"if O
they O
want O
cava" O
you O
offer O
them O
two O
glasses O
in O
the O
desserts O
(he O
tells O
the O
waiter). O

My O
dessert O
was O
edible, O
but O
my O
wife O
ordered O
pineapple O
with O
coconut O
ice O
cream. O

The O
pineapple B-TARGET
had O
an O
intense O
garlic O
flavor. O

I O
guess O
they O
cut O
the O
pineapple O
with O
the O
same O
knife O
they O
cut O
the O
garlic O
with. O

After O
all O
this, O
is O
it O
or O
is O
it O
not O
a O
rip O
off. O

Of O
course O
I O
am O
already O
shouting O
to O
warn O
all O
my O
relations. O

I O
am O
never O
going O
back O
there O
again. O

And O
know O
that O
there O
are O
other O
details O
that O
I O
am O
not O
commenting O
on O
so O
as O
not O
to O
go O
on O
and O
on. O

I O
think O
they O
should O
consider O
keeping O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
their O
website. O

Some O
points, O
for O
me, O
to O
be O
corrected: O

- O
I O
booked O
the O
New O
Year's O
gala O
dinner O
online, O
but O
the O
restaurant O
did O
not O
find O
my O
reservation O
and O
the O
price O
was O
10 O
E. O
higher O
(small O
thing: O
I O
ate O
the O
same); O

- O
It O
could O
be O
better O
organized O
in O
changing O
the O
cutlery, B-TARGET
the O
same O
used O
for O
two O
dishes O
(starter O
and O
main). O

For O
the O
handling O
and O
speed O
of O
service B-TARGET
: O
commendable. O

We O
chose O
the O
menu O
B O
(25 O
euros O
per O
head). O

An O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
to O
bring O
us O
the O
first O
(spent O
the O
first O
hour O
only O
with O
ham O
and O
bread O
with O
tomato). O

We O
asked O
for O
a O
reservation O
in O
writing O
and O
by O
phone O
and O
they O
didn't O
give O
it O
to O
us O
even O
though O
we O
said O
ok. O

We O
said O
the O
number O
of O
diners O
in O
writing O
and O
twice O
by O
phone O
and O
they O
did O
not O
put O
the O
necessary O
chairs. O

A O
real O
disappointment. O

The O
rice, B-TARGET
in O
a O
very O
generous O
portion O
and O
with O
an O
abundance O
of O
complements, O
such O
as O
prawns, O
mussels, O
clams O
and O
prawns. O

We O
could O
not O
finish O
it! O

To O
improve: O
the O
place B-TARGET
where O
the O
portions O
of O
rice O
or O
fish O
are O
served. O

All O
very O
correct, O
very O
close O
and O
accurate O
treatment. B-TARGET

A O
highly O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O

although O
the O
value O
for O
money O
is O
not O
fair, O
quite O
expensive O
for O
what O
they O

which O
is O
not O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
proposed O
in O
the O
offer, O
as O
the O
rice O
was O
going O
to O
be O
lobster O
and O
they O
did O
it O
with O
crayfish O
... O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
very O
scarce, O
only O
two O
truffles O
and O
no O

Drinks B-TARGET
were O
not O
included O
either O
and O
the O

In O
the O
end O
it O
was O
the O
same O
as O
eating O
a O

carte O
and O
without O
being O
able O
to O
choose. O

The O
discount O
is O
50%. O

We O
paid O
18€/person O

for O
a O

4 O

2 O
tostaditas, O
patatas O

and O
for O
the O
main O

we O
ordered O
rice O
with O

For O

2 O

If O
they O
charge O

I'm O
going O

We O
were O
only O

that O
of O
the O
extensive O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
they O
only O
had O
the O
fourth O
option O
we O
requested. O

It O
took O

a O

in O
its O

perhaps O

we O

but O
the O
menu B-TARGET
that O
day, O
at O
least O
what O
I O
tasted, O
very O
fair, O
almost O
suspenseful. O

In O
the O
kitchen O
they O
must O
have O
had O
a O
hangover O
because O
I O
ordered O
noodles B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and O
I'm O
still O
looking O
for O
them, O
it O
was O
Chinese O

We O
dined O
very O
well, O
with O
a O
fair O
price, O
a O
charming O
staff.the B-TARGET
next O
day O
we O
went O
to O
take O
a O
tapa O
with O
a O
wine, O
everything O
was O
very O
niceThe O
only O
downside O
I O
would O
put, O
is O
that O
we O
did O
not O
find O
the O
phone B-TARGET
number I-TARGET
on O
any O
website, O
which O
we O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
without O
knowing O
if O
we O
would O
have O
room. O

We O
have O
been O
delighted. O

We O
were O
there O
last O
night, O
February O
22, O
2015. O

My O
husband O
asked O
for O
a O
reservation O
just O
for O
us, O
and O
we O
did O
not O
miss O
anything. O

We O
ordered O
a O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
everything O
was O
delicious. O

Five O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
sufficient O
quantities O
to O
fill O
you O
up, O
they O
did O
not O
take O
long O
at O
all O
to O
serve O
us, O
always O
attentive O
so O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait. O

Highly O
recommended. O

Only O
one O
small O
detail, O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
background B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
to O
be O
perfect. O

I O
really O
liked O
it, O
there O
are O
those O
who O
make O
analogies O
with O
the O
Diverxo O
restaurant O
in O
Madrid, O
which O
has O
been O
rated O
as O
the O
59 O
best O
restaurant O
in O
the O
world O
... O
saving O
the O
distance O
if O
the O
Gamberro O
was O
in O
Madrid O
I O
think O
we O
would O
see O
it O
with O
different O
eyes, O
my O
congratulations, O
I O
will O
return. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
for O
all O
types O
of O
diners.... O

My O
partner O
and O
I O
love O
creative O
cuisine, O
we O
have O
tried O
all O
this O
type O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Zaragoza O
with O
success O
but O
Gamberro O
disappointed O
us O
a O
lot. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
very O
scarce O
even O
for O
a O
tasting O
menu. O

But O
even O
so, O
if O
the O
food O
had O
been O
successful, O
we O
wouldn't O
have O
cared. O

A O
bit O
bland, O
it O
lacked O
a O
touch... O
in O
short, O
we O
didn't O
like O
it, O
we O
won't O
go O
back, O
and O
I O
don't O
recommend O
it. O

we O
went O
to O
make O
a O
family O
celebration O
to O
HOSTERIA O
BOTIN O
DEL O
CORREGIDOR O
in O
Josefa O
Amar O
y O
Borbom O
street, O
it O
was O
the O
confirmation O
of O
my O
daughter, O
we O
were O
15 O
people O
and O
we O
were O
really O
very O
satisfied, O
the O
price-quality O
relationship O
was O
very O
favorable, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
very O
friendly O
and O
cordial O
and O
the O
dining B-TARGET
room O
upstairs O
was O
very O
nice. O

I O
really O
recommend O
it O
from O
here O
my O
thanks O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
ISABEL O
AND O
MANOLO. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
restaurant O
this O
weekend O
(March O
2009). O

I O
had O
been O
there O
twice O
before. O

This O
was O
the O
third O
and O
last O
time. O

It O
has O
gotten O
noticeably O
worse. O

They O
have O
removed O
the O
menu O
of O
Mexican O
food, O
which O
was O
the O
most O
worthwhile, O
and O
there O
is O
only O
very O
basic O
quality O
Italian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
left. O

I O
ate O
a O
lasagna B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
poorly O
cooked...I O
think O
the O
ones O
sold O
frozen O
in O
supermarkets O
are O
better. O

To O
top O
it O
off, O
they O
entertained O
us O
with O
music B-TARGET
at O
a O
not O
very O
normal O
volume O
of O
Latin O
American O
music O
... O
an O
incongruity O
in O
a O
restaurant O
that O
is O
called O
Monasterio O
and O
gives O
Italian O
food. O

As O
I O
said, O
not O
to O
return. O

Now O
there O
is O
a O
sandwich O
shop. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
closing O
is O
something O
that O
was O
coming. O

I O
had O
been O
to O
several O
group O
dinners O
in O
2004 O
and O
2005 O
and O
nothing O
comparable O
to O
what O
I O
found O
in O
January O
2009: O
lousy O
service, B-TARGET
poor O
food B-TARGET
and O
an O
expensive O
price O
for O
what O
I O
received. O

And O
being O
thrown O
out O
at O
12 O
midnight O
because O
they O
had O
to O
have O
dinner O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
Epiphany O
is O
funny. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
catering O
business O
you O
have O
to O
act O
accordingly. O

Had O
the O
owners O
changed O
or O
something? O

An O
exceptional O
restaurant, B-TARGET
with O
an O
impressive O
quality O
of O
products, B-TARGET
the O
fish B-TARGET
freshly O
brought O
from O
San O
Sebastian, O
and O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
in O
few O
restaurants O
you O
eat O
it O
as O
in O
the O
cider O
house. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
customer O
of O
La O
Kupela O
for O
years O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
they O
have O
always O
maintained O
the O
same O
line O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
their O
products. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
is O
sensational, O
fresh O
and O
cooked O
without O
sauces O
that O
sometimes O
only O
pretend O
to O
mask O
a O
bad O
product. O

And O
as O
for O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
they O
can O
boast O
of O
being O
the O
best O
meat O
in O
Zaragoza, O
and O
I O
would O
dare O
to O
say, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
Spain. O

If O
people O
want O
to O
fill O
their O
bellies O
at O
a O
cheap O
price, O
La O
Kupela O
is O
certainly O
not O
for O
them. O

Please, O
keep O
doing O
it O
as O
always, O
Zaragoza O
deserves O
a O
first O
class O
restaurant, O
and O
believe O
me, O
there O
are O
very O
few. O

Hello O
All O
the O
times O
we O
have O
been O
there O
have O
been O
just O
as O
good: O
quality O
and O
correct O
treatment. B-TARGET

Regarding O
the O
price O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
author O
of O
this O
website. O

Alberto O
Frisch O

Good O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
perhaps O
the O
price O
is O
sometimes O
a O
little O
high O
but O
it O
is O
worth O
trying O
their O
meats. B-TARGET

Too O
expensive O
for O
the O
times. O

If O
they O
do O
not O
catch O
up, O
they O
will O
lose O
customers. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
a O
very O
beautiful O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
but O
the O
price O
is O
a O
bit O
high O
for O
the O
quality O
they O
offer. O

A O
great O
dinner, B-TARGET
impeccable O
service, B-TARGET
fabulous O
food, B-TARGET
an O
extensive O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
and O
perfect O
desserts. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
spacious, O
comfortable O
and O
well O
equipped. O

As O
we O
went O
with O
Argentinean O
friends, O
we O
had O
a O
pica B-TARGET
pica I-TARGET
as O
a O
starter O
so O
that O
they O
could O
try O
typical O
Catalan O
dishes... O
they O
were O
delighted. O

The O
price O
was O
right O
and O
appropriate O
to O
the O
food. B-TARGET

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
the O
tenderloin B-TARGET
... O

Good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

Very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
but O
abnormally O
slow. O

Recommended. O

Highly O
recommended. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
Argentinian O
restaurants O
in O
Barcelona. O

Fantastic, O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good O
but O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
impressive, O
so O
the O
food O
tastes O
even O
better!!! O

Good O
service, O
correct O
suggestions O
and O
good O
quality. O

We O
will O
return O
without O
a O
doubt, O
we O
have O
many O
things O
to O
try.... O
Congratulations, O
keep O
it O
up! O

Totally O

So O
much O
for O
the O
quantity, O
the O

and O
the O

received. O

I O
will O
recommend O
it. O

jmarcoj, O
what O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
"this O
is O
not O
how O
Iberian O
prey O
is O
presented"? O

In O
the O
explanations O
given O
in O
the O
Heraldo O
de O
Aragón O
about O
the O
deserving O
of O
Michelin O
stars, O
reference O
was O
made O
to O
customer O
service O
and O
quality O
in O
the O
service O
and O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes O
constant O
over O
time. O

I O
was O
there O
in O
March O
and O
in O
principle O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
the O
conversations O
at O
the O
tables O
were O
heard O
and O
annoying O
but O
what O
did O
not O
seem O
right O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
quality O
in O
customer O
service, O
I O
explain: O
We O
ordered O
the O
tasting O
menu O
and O
when O
asked, O
a O
detail, O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
record O
any O
food O
that O
we O
did O
not O
like, O
we O
said O
that O
in O
the O
dishes O
that O
were O
prepared O
at O
the O
time O
they O
did O
not O
put O
salt. O
In O
one O
of O
the O
dishes O
they O
took O
out O
fresh O
grilled O
foie O
full O
of O
salt O
and O
when O
we O
made O
the O
observation O
they O
apologized O
but O
did O
not O
offer O
to O
remake O
it O
without O
salt, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
is O
correct O
first O
to O
demonstrate O
the O
little O
attention B-TARGET
paid O
to O
the O
requests O
of O
customers O
who O
are O
distributed O
in O
5 O
tables O
and O
secondly O
for O
the O
cuteness O
of O
not O
rectify O
the O
error. O

We O
were O
offered O
three O
starters, O
an O
exquisite O
risotto B-TARGET
and O
two O
other O
dishes O
that O
would O
have O
been O
very O
tasty O
but O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
were O
covered O
with O
orange B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
roe I-TARGET
that O
with O
its O
strong O
flavor O
and O
being O
preserved O
in O
salt O
masked O
the O
original O
flavor O
of O
the O
dishes, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
it O
was O
a O
coincidence O
to O
add O
the O
roe O
to O
the O
two O
dishes, O
but O
if O
they O
did O
not O
do O
it O
to O
finish O
the O
tin, O
repeat O
twice O
and O
then O
add O
something O
very O
salty O
when O
we O
had O
mentioned O
the O
issue O
of O
salt O
and O
that O
the O
dishes O
could O
have O
been O
served O
without O
the O
roe. O

The O
rest O
was O
fine O
but O
we O
were O
disappointed O
on O
a O
special O
day. O

[...] O
Bal O
d'Onsera O
Restaurant O
in O
Zaragoza, O
maintains O
its O
Michelin O
star O
for O
2010 O
[...]. O

Sincerely O
I O
see O
it O
right O
with O
the O
explanations, O
but O
for O
my O
taste O
is O
an O
outrage O
to O
pay O
170 O
euros O
per O
couple O
for O
what O
was O
presented O
counting O
that O
no O
coffees O
were O
taken, O
and O
I O
respect O
it O
as O
it O
has O
a O
Michelin O
star, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
give O
the O
right O
to O
charge O
per O
star, O
place O
or O
person O
with O
whom O
you O
have O
learned, O
the O
kitchen O
is O
an O
art, O
a O
taste O
and O
a O
way O
to O
present O
a O
work, O
so O
it O
is O
difficult O
that O
many O
people O
can O
know O
it. O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
restaurants O
are O
for O
tasting O
what O
you O
eat, O
drink, O
talk, O
and O
have O
a O
little O
after-dinner O
conversation, O
restaurants O
have O
to O
have O
that O
incentive, O
because O
it O
is O
like O
going O
to O
the O
movies O
and O
you O
can't O
laugh, O
cry, O
or O
fall O
asleep O
in O
the O
worst O
case. O

I O
like O
everyone, O
but O
it O
will O
be O
difficult O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
places O
like O
this, O
I O
wish O
you O
the O
best. O

Thanks O
for O
your O
chronicle, O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
help O
for O
me O
to O
decide O
where O
NOT O
to O
go O
to O
celebrate O
a O
special O
dinner, O
I O
will O
leave O
my O
place O
for O
the O
experienced O
food O
critics. O

Thank O
you O
for O
being O
so O
independent O
and O
so O
sincere O
in O
your O
chronicles, O
keep O
it O
up. O

I O
can O
see O
that O
I O
am O
right, O
you O
are O
not O
Aragonese, O
nor O
have O
you O
understood O
the O
formula. O

What O
may O
be O
a O
tiring O
mental O
exercise O
for O
you, O
does O
not O
have O
to O
be O
for O
others. O

However, O
I O
am O
looking O
forward O
to O
know O
the O
coefficients O
and O
parameters O
evaluated. O

And O
by O
the O
way, O
to O
know O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
return O
without O
touching O
the O
nose. O

Mr. O
Gonzalo O
López O
Madrazo, O
I O
agree O
with O
your O
comments, O
I O
don't O
like O
to O
be O
bothered O
asking O
me O
how O
the O
food O
was, O
a O
question O
that O
is O
almost O
always O
rhetorical, O
and O
I O
would O
expect O
a O
"very O
good", O
"perfect, O
thank O
you". O

What O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
is O
that O
it O
is O
not O
centrally O
located, O
for O
me O
it O
is O
in O
the O
best O
area B-TARGET
of O
the O
city, O
between O
the O
Plaza O
del O
Pilar O
and O
Plaza O
de O
España, O
in O
the O
tube, O
authentic O
meolo O
of O
Zaragoza O
full O
of O
centuries O
of O
history. O

<->Absolutely O
nothing. O

<+>The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
. O

Everything O
perfect O

Great! O

Good O
service B-TARGET
, O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
medium O
price. O

Varied O
menu: B-TARGET
the O
eggs B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
, O
the O
calçots B-TARGET
and O
meat B-TARGET
in O
general. O

To O
say O
something O
. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
could O
be O
improved O

We O
had O
a O
reservation O
for O
a O
calçotada. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
we O
had O
never O
tried O
it O
and O
did O
not O
know O
how O
to O
eat O
them O
and O
one O
of O
the O
waiters O
put O
on O
some O
gloves O
and O
showed O
us. O

They O
were B-TARGET
all I-TARGET
very I-TARGET
friendly I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
attentive. I-TARGET

The O
quantity O
and O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

Very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
service. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

As O
a O
first O
course O
we O
ordered O
asparagus B-TARGET
and O
they O
served O
it O
cold O
with O
a O
cold O
sauce. B-TARGET

We O
did O
not O
like O
it O
very O
much. O

Then O
we O
ordered O
meat B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
good, O
but O
the O
side O
dish B-TARGET
was O
also O
cold. O

I O
was O
right O
with O
the O
dessert. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
on O
time. O

Totally O
recommendable O
to O
have O
a O
calçotada O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona. O

We O
took O
the O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu O
and O
it O
was O
very O
correct O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
repeating O
calçots B-TARGET
and O
the O
drink B-TARGET
included O
without O
limit. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
was O
also O
good. O

We O
were O
15 O
and O
it O
was O
very O
good O
for O
being O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona. O

Enjoy O
with O
your O
partner O
in O
a O
very O
modern O
atmosphere B-TARGET
but O
without O
losing O
warmth O
and O
enjoying O
a O
varied O
menu B-TARGET
that O
covers O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
preferences. O

We O
made O
a O
reservation O
for O
11 O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
everything O
was O
very O
correct. O

The O
attention B-TARGET
of O
the O
boss O
was O
excellent, O
punctual O
in O
the O
reservation, O
and O
a O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
the O
calçotada O
menu. O

Perhaps O
the O
only O
downside O
(for O
my O
taste) O
is O
that O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
big O
(although O
it O
is O
true O
that O
they O
let O
you O
repeat O
calçots B-TARGET
and O
that O
almost O
everyone O
was O
already O
full). O

The O
calçots B-TARGET
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
too. O

If O
you O
organize O
something O
in O

you O
want O
to O
look O
good O
with O
your O

I O
recommend O
it O
without O
a O

We O
ordered O
the O
calçotada B-TARGET

and O
everything O
was O
very O
good...the O
restaurant B-TARGET

only O
thing O
is O
that O
the O

everything O
is O
fine. O

For O
a O

I O
had O
to O
cancel O
the O
reservation, O
communicating O
the O
issue O
in O
a O
timely O
manner O
to O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
restaurant, B-TARGET

in O
previous O

is O
very O

Highly O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
(when O
we O
made O
the O
reservation O
we O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
an O
anniversary, O
and O
they O
placed O
us O
in O
a O
romantic O
corner O
and O
presented O
us O
with O
2 O
glasses O
of O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
simple, O
well O
prepared O
and O
well O
presented. O

The O
quality-price O
ratio O
is O
good. O

It O
is O
a O
place O

down O
in O
my O
agenda. O

Very O
tasty O

the O

The O
calçotada B-TARGET

was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
complete O
and O
the O

was O
very O

the O

Excellent O

they O
offer O
you O

menu. O

We O
spent O
a O
good O
night O
celebrating O
21 O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
friendly, O
with O
the O

of O
repeating O

from O
the O

A O

not O

anything O

Yesterday O
I O
went O
with O
two O
friends O
for O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
they O
treated O
us O
very O
well, O
they O
had O
the O
table O
ready O
for O
us O
even O
though O
we O
arrived O
late. O

They O
were O
fast, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
varied O
and O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
good, O
in O
my O
opinion O
it O
is O
totally O
recommendable. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
but O
if O
anything O
stands O
out O
above O
all, O
is O
the O
attentive O
treatment O
of O
all O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
who O
you O
see O
wanting O
to O
do O
everything O
right O
for O
the O
customer. O

Without O
hesitation O
we O
will O
repeat. O

If O
we O
had O
to O
put O
a O
but, O
this O
would O
be O
how O
tight O
we O
were, O
but O
I O
understand O
that O
with O
a O
group O
of O
18 O
and O
on O
a O
day O
of O
kings, O
the O
location O
should O
not O
be O
easy. O

The O
reservation O
service O
offered O
by O
Central O
de O
Reservas O
was O
perfect. O

The O
restaurant O
phoned O
me O
to O
confirm O
the O
reservation O
and O
the O
table O
and O
time O
were O
totally O
adjusted O
to O
what O
was O
required. O

The O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
normal, O
some O
products O
better O
than O
others. O

Fast, O
comfortable O
and O
efficient. O

A O
success. O

We O
all O
left O
happy, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good. O

We O
changed O
a O
little O
the O
menu O
that O
was O
advertised. O

The O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
very O
well O
recommended. O

Everything O
was O
correct O
for O
the O
level O
of O
people O
that O
were O
there. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
well O

along O
with O
good O
service. B-TARGET

Excellent O
description O
Fernando, O
I O
had O
understood O
that O
La O
Matilde O
was O
much O
more O
expensive, O
good O
to O
know O
that O
for O
that O
price O
you O
can O
dine O
there. O

I O
was O
there O
two O
weeks O
ago, O
I O
was O
back O
after O
2 O
years O
(then O
I O
was O
amazed) O
but O
now O
in O
2010 O
I O
saw O
it O
a O
little O
left, O
I O
was O
not O
surprised O
at O
all O
and O
the O
impression O
I O
got O
was O
that O
they O
had O
little O
variety O
to O
choose O
from. O

It O
was O
all O
very O
good O
but O
I O
don't O
think O
I O
will O
go O
a O
third O
time. O

In O
terms O
of O
value O
for O
money O
and O
within O
its O
category, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view, O
it O
should O
be O
one O
of O
the O
reference O
restaurants B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza. O

Its O
experience, O
professionalism, O
exquisite O
service B-TARGET
and O
treatment O
provide O
an O
added O
value O
that O
is O
difficult O
to O
match O
at O
this O
time. O

Its O
management B-TARGET
more O
than O
achieves O
what O
I O
understand O
it O
intends. O

Whoever O
goes O
to O
eat, O
no O
matter O
when O
they O
go, O
already O
knows O
what O
they O
are O
going O
to O
find: O
top O
quality, B-TARGET
unique O
wine O
cellar, B-TARGET
renewed O
menu B-TARGET
but O
without O
surprises, O
polite O
and O
pleasant O
treatment B-TARGET
that O
invites O
you O
to O
come O
back O
before O
you O
have O
left. O

Even O
if O
it O
is O
the O
first O
time O
you O
visit O
them, O
you O
leave O
with O
the O
feeling O
that O
you O
have O
always O
known O
them. O

In O
short, O
a O
charm. O

(Although O
it O
may O
seem O
an O
exaggerated O
comment, O
it O
is O
not O
and O
I O
clarify, O
I O
am O
not O

a O

for O
anyone O
who O
understands O
as O
aberrant O
the O
anti-smoking O
crusade O
undertaken O

this O
decrepit O
and O

Best O
regards O

American O
cuisine O
and O

restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
regular O
quality. O

If O
the O
dining O
rooms O
are O
not O
too O
crowded O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
food B-TARGET
are O
not O
bad. O

The O
problem O
comes O
when O
they O
are O
full, O
since O
they O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
staff B-TARGET
to O
serve O
them.this O
restaurant O
is O
located O
next O
to O
the O
soccer O
field O
of O
the O
Romareda. O

And O
on O
match O
days O
it O
is O
even O
worse O
because O
of O
the O
influx O
of O
customers O
and O
the O
clear O
lack O
of O
staff. B-TARGET

One O
of O
these O
days O
my O
experience O
was O
totally O
negative O
since O
apparently O
one O
of O
the O
owners O
or O
manager O
went O
into O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
screams O
could O
be O
heard O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
when O
the O
place O
was O
full. O

Overall O
not O
recommended O
if O
you O
do O
not O
know O
which O
days O
Zaragoza O
plays O
at O
home O
or O
it O
is O
very O
crowded. O

It O
is O
an O
area O
where O
there O
is O
no O
shortage O
of O
better O
quality O
restaurants. O

A O
few O
weeks O
ago O
I O
was O
walking O
around O
the O
Romareda O
area O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
son. O

We O
saw O
the O
Pasta O
City O
restaurant O
and O
decided O
to O
stay O
for O
lunch. O

The O
appearance O
of O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
poor O
imitation O
of O
typical O
American O
fast O
food O
restaurants. O

And O
since O
it O
is O
mostly O
glassed O
in O
and O
it O
was O
a O
hot O
day, O
you O
could O
almost O
roast O
chickens O
in O
the O
dining B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
without O
an O
oven. O

We O
decided O
to O
stay O
anyway. O

We O
ask O
for O
the O
menu, O
and O
our O
surprise O
is O
that O
they O
bring O
us O
three O
menus, O
including O
the O
dessert O
menu. O

We O
thought, O
well, O
at O
least O
we O
will O
have O
variety. O

Variety O
yes, O
but O
in O
the O
menu. O

Because O
in O
practice, O
from O
our O
first O
choice O
of O
dishes, O
they O
didn't O
have O
two. O

They O
didn't O
have O
two. O

Including O
something O
as O
elementary O
and O
basic O
as O
a O
steak. O

We O
were O
recommended O
some O
grilled O
ribs, O
and O
we O
listened O
to O
the O
waiter, O
and O
for O
starters, O
a O
variety O
of O
onion O
rings, O
nuggets O
and O
mozzarella O
breadcrumbs O
with O
various O
sauces O
like O
those O
you O
can O
find O
in O
any O
supermarket. O

That O
is, O
served O
in O
small O
bowls. O

And O
secondly, O
a O
children's O
menu O
for O
the O
little O
one, O
consisting O
of O
a O
hambueguesa O
with O
potatoes O
and O
the O
recommended O
ribs, O
along O
with O
two O
soft O
drinks O
and O
a O
beer.at O
this O
point O
in O
my O
opinion O
I O
think O
it O
goes O
without O
saying O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
did O
not O
stop O
being O
typical O
of O
a O
franchise O
of O
this O
type O
but O
in O
bad. O

All O
with O
canned O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
frozen O
products. B-TARGET

The O
bill O
was O
excessive O
for O
the O
type O
of O
food, B-TARGET
the O
quality O
and O
quantity, O
and O
we O
paid O
64 O
euros. O

We O
paid O
64 O
euros.the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
also O
to O
say O
that O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
we O
were O
four O
and O
the O
one O
with O
the O
guitar.to O
sum O
up. O

My O
experience B-TARGET
is O
negative O
and O
I O
will O
not O
return. O

Any O
other O
place O
with O
a O
special O
menu O
is O
better O
priced O
and O
the O
food O
is O
homemade O
and O
fresher. O

I O
take O
note O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

You'll O
see O
when O
I O
tell O
my O
father O
who O
is O
gaditano O
to O
the O
core. O

A O
greeting O
and O
congratulations O
for O
this O
magnificent O
page, O
friend. O

02-12-2012 O
we O
chose O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
the O
comments, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
disappointment. O

We O
are O
four O
diners O
and O
We O
have O
ordered: O
Plate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ham I-TARGET
(they O
tell O
us O
that O
it O
is O
5J) O
for O
us O
we O
understand O
that O
by O
the O
stairs O
was O
lost O
some. O
Shrimp B-TARGET
pancakes I-TARGET
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Huelva O
or O
Cadiz O
but O
there O
is O
so O
much O
difference O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
assess. O

Hortigillas, B-TARGET
terrible, O
it O
seemed O
that O
you O
were O
eating O
sand O
from O
the O
beach. O

Puntillitas, B-TARGET
although O
with O
a O
certain O
taste O
of O
burnt O
oil O
were O
acceptable. O

Arroz B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
Señorito, I-TARGET
a O
real O

overcooked O
and O
the O
cook O
dropped O
the O

IMPOSSIBLE O
TO O

Besugo B-TARGET
al I-TARGET

Inedible O
(soft O

with O
a O

impossible O
to O

THIS O
WE O
SAY O

A O
FULL O
MOUTH O
AND O
WITHOUT O
TAPPING, O
WE O
ARE O

EVERYTHING O
WE O
ASK O

IT O

AND O
WHAT O
IS O
SERVED O
IS O
AS O
CLOSE O
TO O
REALITY O
AS O
AN O
EGG O
TO O
A O
CHESTNUT. O

By O
the O
way, O
they O
had O
the O
wisdom O
not O
to O
charge O
us O
for O
the O
sea O
bream O
but O
for O
the O
rice. O

And O
finally O
the O

were O
out O

but O
in O

Hello O
Jose O
Carlos: O
in O
the O
tasting O
menu O
you O
can O
choose O
meat O
(I O
do O
not O
remember O
if O
entrecote O
or O
sirloin) O
or O
fresh O
fish O
they O
have, O
I O
have O
always O
eaten O
fish O
but O
surely O
the O
meat O
is O
of O
good O
quality O
too. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O

menu O
you O
can O
also O
order O
a O
normal O
menu O
with O
all O
the O
usual O
items. O

Best O

Pedro: O
I'm O
afraid O
you O
haven't O
tried O
the O
right O
Aragonese O
cavas O
like O
the O
Cava O
Monasterio O
de O
Veruela O
or O
the O
Reinante, O
or O
the O
Real O
de O
Aragón, O
... O
any O
of O
these O
are O
better O
value O
for O
money O
than O
the O
Catalans. O

JoséI O
have O
tasted O
quite O
a O
few O
Aragonese O
cavas: O
Bordejé, O
Bordejé O
chardonnay, O
Monasterio O
de O
Veruela, O
Corona O
de O
Aragón, O
... O
and O
all O
the O
ones O
I O
have O
tasted O
so O
far O
leave O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
from O
my O
humble O
point O
of O
view. O

Above O
all, O
they O
lack O
freshness O
and O
fruitiness O
and O
tend O
to O
suffer O
from O
a O
certain O
tightness. O

A O
very O
notable O
exception O
is O
the O
one O
from O
Bodegas O
Lalanne O
(Lucrecia O
Lalanne O
brut O
nature). O
I O
have O
not O
tasted O
either O
Reinante O
or O
Real O
de O
Aragón. O

I O
assure O
you O
that, O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
have O
the O
chance, O
I O
will O
try O
them O
and O
I O
will O
agree O
with O
you O
here O
if O
I O
like O
them. O

Very O
nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET

By O
chance O
my O
partner O
and O
I O
ended O
up O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
we O
were O
offered O
the O
menu O
and O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day, O
we O
opted O
for O
the O
menu. O

First O
octopus O
salpicon O
and O
toast O
of O
escalibada O
and O
black O
olives O
with O
pickled O
quail O
and O
second O
duck O
breast O
with O
peach O
sauce O
and O
cous-cous O
and O
veal O
meatballs, O
the O
truth O
that O
we O
were O
very O
happy O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
a O
great O
value B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
money. I-TARGET

We O
did O
not O
know O
it O
but O
we O
will O
come O
back O
for O
sure. O

Very O
recommendable O
place O
for O
its O
food B-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

A O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
well O
cooked O
and O
presented. O

I O
recommend O
it. O

Quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
table O
service, B-TARGET
they O
were O
very O
attentive O
at O
all O
times O
- O
a O
10. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
although O
the O
"tent" B-TARGET
is O
fairground. O

The O
service B-TARGET
very O
fair, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
a O
bit O
decadent, O
and O
both O
the O
paella B-TARGET
and O
the O
fideuá, B-TARGET
tasteless, O
prefabricated O
and O
almost O
inedible. O

Bad, O
we O
will O
not O
return. O

An O
excellent O
Christmas O
day. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
was O
very O
varied O
and O
plentiful, O
and O
the O
products B-TARGET
were O
of O
high O
quality. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
perfect. O

There O
were O
many O
waiters, B-TARGET
making O
sure O
that O
no O
one O
lacked O
anything O
and O
that O
they O
felt O
at O
ease. O

We O
will O
return O
very O
soon O
to O
enjoy O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
capital O
letters. O

Nice O
waiters, B-TARGET
appreciable O
food, B-TARGET
not O
exceptional, O
fair O
price B-TARGET
... O
awful B-TARGET
noise, I-TARGET
many O
people O
around O
to O
get O
seats O
... O
which O
is O
more O
annoying O
than O
necessary. O

a O
bit O
expensive O

Good O

Very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

Excellent O
organization. B-TARGET

You O
have O
a O
very O
good O
time O
in O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
love O
the O
fish B-TARGET
in O
Salamanca! O

Always O
very O
fresh O
(normal!) O

and O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
speaks O
all O
languages! O

That's O
why O
I O
come O
back O
every O
year! O

Only O
the O
rosé O
wine B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
bit O
medium. O

In O
general O
everything O
is O
fine O

We O
went O
on O
a O
Sunday O
to O
celebrate O
my O
70th O
birthday O
with O
my O
children O
and O
friends. O

Excellent O

Good O
service O
from O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
although O
he O
had O
too O
many O
tables O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
get O
his O
attention O
to O
order O
something. O

The O
mariscada B-TARGET
imperial I-TARGET
is O
impressive, O
although O
it O
was O
served O
a O
bit O
cold. O

If O
you O
choose O
seafood, B-TARGET
don't O
order O
anything O
as O
a O
starter O
(the O
waiter O
recommended O
us O
to O
choose O
a O
starter O
that O
arrived O
with O
the O
seafood, O
and O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
finish O
with O
it). O

We O
went O
on O
Christmas O
Day. O

Our O
online O
reservation O
did O
not O
work, O
and O
they O
told O
us O
that O
it O
was O
better O
to O
contact O
them O
directly. O

The O
table B-TARGET
they O
prepared O
for O
us O
had O
water O
falling O
from O
the O
ceiling, O
and O
we O
were O
glued O
to O
the O
heating. O

Of O
the O
8 O
Christmas O
menus, B-TARGET
only O
1 O
was O
available...it O
is O
true O
that O
we O
ate O
well, O
but O
with O
a O
great O
sense O
of O
humor.... O

My O
father O
and O
my O
brother O
have O
been O
going O
to O
eat O
once O
a O
week O
at O
the O
Salamanca O
for O
many O
years O
(on O
weekdays) O
because O
they O
feel O
at O
home O
and O
in O
general O
my O
whole O
family O
likes O
it O
very O
much. O

Regarding O
the O
service O
I O
disagree O
with O
the O
review O
below, O
both O
Silvestre O
(endearing) O
and O
his O
entire O
team O
treat O
all O
their O
guests O
exceptionally, O
which O
together O
with O
the O
beauty O
of O
all O
its O
rooms O
makes O
you O
feel O
in O
a O
special O
place. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
in O
January O
with O
a O
work O
commitment O
and O
in O
these O
cases O
I O
always O
go O
there O
because O
it O
is O
a O
safe O
bet. O

The O
imperial O
seafood O
is O
excellent O
but O
if O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
go O
so O
high O
the O
grilled O
fish O
and O
seafood O
is O
another O
very O
good O
option. O

Their O
rice O
dishes O
are O
remarkable O
and O
the O
permanent O
detail O
of O
the O
santiaguiña O
and O
the O
bottles O
of O
orujo O
at O
the O
table O
is O
appreciated. O

<->I O
don't O
know O

<+>Well O
communicated O
and O
comfortable O

Expensive O
for O
what O
they O
give O
to O
eat, O
tables B-TARGET
very O
close O
together O
and O
quite O
noisy. O

Good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
paella B-TARGET
is O
weak. O

Very O
touristy. O

Good O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona O
delant O
de O
mar. O

I O
was O
eating O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
we O
had O
some O
very O
well O
recommended O
starters, B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
a O
Paella O
Perelada. O

Everything O
was O
perfect O
and O
as O
always, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

It O
is O
a O
safe O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
go O
and O
always O
repeat O
their O
traditional O
dishes. B-TARGET
