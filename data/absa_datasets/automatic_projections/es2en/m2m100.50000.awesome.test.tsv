The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty. O

Anyone O
who O
loves O
meat O
has O
a O
fairly O
wide O
card B-TARGET
to O
choose O
from, O
although O
yesterday O
they O
didn’t O
have O
chuleton. B-TARGET

The O
only O
thing O
that O
surprised O
us O
was O
that O
the O
entrances O
and O
the O
main O
dishes O
were O
served O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

by O
Buff, O

I O
don’t O
know O
where O
to O
start! O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
attention, O
impressive. O

Meat B-TARGET
is O
phenomenal O

Tapas B-TARGET
and O
Drinks B-TARGET
and O
the O
Environment B-TARGET

I’ve O
already O
celebrated O
many O
Birthdays O
in O
Restaurants, O
but O
they’ve O
never O
treated O
me O
so O
well O
and O
they’ve O
made O
me O
so O
many O
details O
k O
I O
like O
and O
excite O
a O
lot. O

So O
you O
want O
to O
go O
through O
a O
phenomenal O
event O
that O
you’re O
waiting O
for. O

Reserve O
a O
table, O
which O
in O
9 B-TARGET
queens I-TARGET
is O
worth O
it. O

thanks O
team B-TARGET

Whenever O
we O
come O
to O
Barcelona O
we O
will O
eat O
or O
dinner. O

and O
Imperdible! O

Excellent O
meats B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
pastas B-TARGET
(especially O
the O
sorrentinos!). B-TARGET

The O

is O
very O
nice O

very O
friendly O

attentive. O

We O
will O
continue O

to O
Barna! O

I O
was O
with O
my O
partner O
on O
April O
10th, O
celebrating O
my O
birthday O
what O
was O
the O
day O
before. O

We O
went O
to O
9R B-TARGET
for O
an O
opinion O
on O
this O
same O
page O
that O
put O
it O
very O
well, O
and O
we O
totally O
agree O
with O
that O
opinion. O

In O
9R B-TARGET
they O
treated O
us O
great, O
Julio B-TARGET
was O
attentive, O
cordial O
and O
fun, O
he O
treated O
us O
wonderfully O
just O
like O
the O
others. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
elegant, O
decorated O
with O
pleasure, O
by O
putting O
a O
fist O
I O
think O
q O
the O
lighting B-TARGET
(2nd O
floor) O
is O
very O
strong, O
they O
could O
put O
a O
softer O
light O
or O
hot.... O
this O
would O
be O
the O
only O
fist O
q O
I O
can O
put O
them O
and O
it O
is O
a O
choked O
pq O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
treat B-TARGET
is O
a O
10, O
invited O
us O
to O
cake O
and O
cava O
without O
any O
reason! O

We O
will O
be O
back O
safely!! O

100% O
is O
recommended! O

Excellent O
experience, B-TARGET
excellent O
disposition B-TARGET
and O
good O
attention. B-TARGET

The O
divine O
food. B-TARGET

We O
had O
dinner O
and O
we O
loved O
it. O

The O
space B-TARGET
is O
very O
relaxing, O
colors O
that O
make O
the O
corners O
sober. O

The O
attention B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
impeccable O
staff. O

The O
Immaculate O
Food. B-TARGET

The O
detail B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET

by O

and O
grateful. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
Majuscules!!! O

Recommended O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
centre O
of O
Barcelona O

Ask O
for O
a O
table O
on O
the O
first O
floor. O

The O
entrance B-TARGET
door I-TARGET
is O
automatic O
and O
if O
it’s O
cold, O
one O

The O
best O
meat B-TARGET
I’ve O
eaten O
in O
Barcelona. O

The O
best O
BCN O
meat. B-TARGET

Spectacular O
entrance, B-TARGET
needed O
to O
eat O
real O
meat B-TARGET
after O
the O
holidays! O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
food, B-TARGET
we O
will O
be O
back. O

Towards O
a O
cold! B-TARGET

No O
shortage O
of O
ice O
in O
the O
drink. O

We O
made O
some O
varied O
entrances B-TARGET
from O
the O
start, O
pretty O
good! O

based O
on O
empanadilla, B-TARGET
chorizo B-TARGET
and O
demas. O

And O
then O
Solomon. O

Unlike O
other O
Argentines, O
if O
you O
ask O
it O
live O
they O
bring O
it O
alive, O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

The O
very O
friendly O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
the O
welcoming O
and O
modern O
site. B-TARGET

Ideal O
for O
4 O
to O
8 O
people. O

Well O
the O
truth. O

Darin O
would O
be O
proud O
(if O
not O
already) O

A O
beautiful O
place B-TARGET
its O
spectacular O
view, B-TARGET
its O
very O
expensive O
letter B-TARGET
in O
prices, O
not O
recommended O
for O
what O
you O
eat, O
its O
very O
poorly O
treated O
maitre, B-TARGET
its O
very O
distracted O
waitress, B-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
noise. O

Slow O
service, B-TARGET
mediocre O
quality O
and O
expensive O
price. O

not O
recommended. O

Excellent O

Very O
good O
camarers. B-TARGET

Unfriendly O
officers. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
receptionists. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
environment, B-TARGET
but O
too O
bullish. O

Price O
a O
bit O
high. O

Excellent O
situation. B-TARGET

the O
right O
restaurant O
of O
the O
line O
of O
the O
others O
olive, O
etc. O

Perfect O
location B-TARGET
both O
in O
summer O
and O
winter. O

We’ve O
been O
there O
for O
years O
and O
we’ve O
always O
liked O
their O
cuisine. B-TARGET

the O
menu B-TARGET
seems O
to O
me O
very O
complete O
but O
I O
would O
add O
something O
like O
rabbit O
stofed O
or O
turkey/chicken O
to O
the O
oven, O
and O
when O
to O
dessert, B-TARGET
I O
think O
very O
well, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
restaurants O
with O
the O
largest O
amount O
of O
dessert O
and O
very O
varied, O
the O
happy O
ones O
without O
reference O
I O
greet O
you O
and O
I O
hope O
to O
visit O
your O
restaurant O
soon. O

It O
is O
undoubtedly O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
in O
Barcelona O
for O
its O
quality O
both O
in O
the O
product B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
care O
of O
every O
detail O
of O
its O
staff. B-TARGET

All O
carefully O
and O
approved O
by O
the O
careful, O
elegant, O
tireless, O
and O
professional O
eye O
of O
his O
orchestral O
director; O
don B-TARGET
Ramón I-TARGET
Ferreira. I-TARGET

The O
gentleness O
of O
the O
master. B-TARGET

Less O
attentive O
to O
the O
price... O

An O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
business O
meal. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
the O
company O
last O
week O
and O
it O
was B-TARGET
all I-TARGET
fantastic. I-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

Excellent O
quality O
price O
and O
well O
located. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located O
and O
a O
magnificent O
terrace O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
has O
much O
qiue O
to O
wish O
for. O

Never O
ask O
for O
rape B-TARGET
with O
sauce O
or O
the O
sauce. O

They’ll O
be O
very O
good O
at O
rape, O
but O
I O
don’t O
think O
in O
rape. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
gambas B-TARGET
in O
particular O
is O
fantastic. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
normal. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
should O
be O
more O
attentive O
to O
the O
clientele. O

The O
average O
fee O
per O
person O
is O
50 O
euros. O

Eating O
or O
dining O
at O
the O
Barceloneta O
is O
a O
guarantee O
of O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
good O

A O
careful O

Time B-TARGET

Speed B-TARGET
in O

Dinner O
in O
an O
hour O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
great O
for O
its O
ambiance O
and O
privileged O
situation, O
the O
very O
correct O
and O
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
the O
relationship O
quality O
price, O
good O
quality, O
quantity O
of O
rations B-TARGET
somewhat O
packed O
and O
expensive O
price, O
given O
the O
times O
that O
run. O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
treat. B-TARGET

A O
bit O
expensive. O

Typical O
for O
tourists, O
roaring B-TARGET
and O
unprofessional. O

I O
haven’t O
found O
anything O
negative O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
a O
long O
time. O

I O
only O
ask O
you O
to O
stay O
the O
same O
and O
not O
lower O
that O
extraordinary O
level O
of O
“excellence.” O

The O
extraordinary O
quality O
of O
the O
product, B-TARGET
especially O
of O
fish B-TARGET
and O
seafood. B-TARGET

The O
optimum O
homogeneity. O

<+>I O
have O
been O
many O
times, O
I O
have O
recommended O
it O
to O
family, O
friends O
and O
relatives O
and O
has O
never O
disappointed O
anyone. O

<+>It O
is O
always O
the O
same O
as O
“excellent.” O

A O
lot O
of O
tourists O
and O
therefore O
too O
much O
noise. O

It O
generallyins O
the O
quality O
of O
its O
dishes B-TARGET
but O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
wine B-TARGET
chart O
are O
too O
high. O

To O
my O
taste, O
the O
paella B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
moll O
of O
the O
clock O
is O
at O
the O
right O
point. O

A O
restaurant O
that O
I O
would O
qualify O
as O
a O
safe O
value O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
but O
improved O
in O
service B-TARGET
though O
without O
being O
disastrous O
or O
much O
less. O

The O
day O
you O
discover O
it O
becomes O
part O
of O
your O
decoration!!! O

Very O
nice, O
impeccable O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
close, O
we O
had O
it O
great. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
the O
good O
references O
I O
had O
received O
and O
it O
did O
not O
disappoint O
me. O

The O
careful O
attention B-TARGET
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
excellent. O

No O
problem O
with O
the O
reservation O
made O
through O
this O
website. O

We O
ate O
very O
well, O
we O
it. O

Everything O
was O
as O
we O
hoped O
and O
had O
commented, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere, O
undoubtedly O
a O
restaurant O
where O
to O
go O
when O
you O
want O
everyone O
to O
be O
happy. O

A O
good O
choice. O

Excellent O
restaurant O
with O
special O
attention B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Given O
the O
weather O
allowed, O
we O
were O
reserved O
a O
table O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
very O
well O
arranged O
and O
located. O

It O
is O
highly O
recommended. O

Suitable O
for O
all O
types O
of O
ages O
but, O
in O
our O
opinion, O
advisable O
for O
older O
than O
30 O
years O
from O
now O
on O
either O
couples O
or O
groups. O

This O
is O
an O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
a O
special O
event. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
of O
good O
quality, O
although O
the O
price O
is O
high. O

Nothing O
to O
highlight O

<+> O
Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET

Excellent O
food, B-TARGET
but O
little O
personal B-TARGET
when O
the O
restaurant O
is O
full. O

It O
took O
over O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
bring O
the O
bill, O
requested O
several O
times. O

I O
repeat, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

We O
have O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
several O
times. O

Today O
will O
be O
the O
last. O

The O
entrances B-TARGET
were O
good, O
but O
the O
brown B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
I O
returned O
because O
it O
had O
no O
taste O
at O
all. O

They O
brought O
me O
another O
and O
according O
to O
the O
waitress O
they O
changed O
an O
ingredient. O

(They O
put O
more O
salt O
on O
it.) O

Service B-TARGET
very, O
very O
bad. O

They O
serve O
the O
wine O
watering O
the O
whole O
table. O

We O
had O
not O
finished O
the O
entrances O
yet O
and O
they O
had O
already O
come O
to O
take O
out O
the O
plates O
to O
put O
the O
second. O

It O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
wanted O
us O
to O
go O
straight O
away, O
so O
we O
could O
fill O
the O
table O
again.In O
the O
afternoon, O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
above, O
there O
was O
a O
political O
event O
doing O
campaign O
(with O
speakers), O
which O
I O
did O
not O
care O
at O
all. O

I O
have O
been O
charged O
the O
same. O

I O
will O
not O
return. O

Hot B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
was O
not O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
good O
rice. O

Very O
floating. O

The O
rest O
well. O

The O
site B-TARGET
has O
seemed O
to O
me O
very O
well O
located, O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
attention O
very O
good, O
as O
suggests O
a O
little O
more O
generosity O
in O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
it O
as O
much O
as O
the O
three O
friends O
who O
accompanied O
me. O

Very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
presentation B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

Exceptional O
food B-TARGET
and O
views. B-TARGET

The O
price O
ratio O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
recommended. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
was O
great.The O
very O
welcoming O
place B-TARGET
of O
an O
impeccable O
taste. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
very O
fast O
service. B-TARGET

You O
barely O
had O
to O
wait O
between O
the O
plate O
and O
the O
plate. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
insuperable, O
fresh, O
tender, O
the O
presentation B-TARGET
is O
very O
original O
and O
creative. O

I O
am O
delighted O

Write O
your O
comment O
here... O

All O
very O
well! O

It O
was O
all O
perfect, O
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
treat! B-TARGET

Lights O
and O
shadows O
on O
my O
first O
visit O
to O
Mecca. B-TARGET

It O
is O
an O
original O
and O
attractive O
site, B-TARGET
but O
in O
short, O
and O
cutting O
me O
to O
the O
food, B-TARGET
it O
is O
scarce O
in O
quantity O
and, O
in O
some O
of O
the O
dishes, O
in O
quality O
or, O
better O
said, O
in O
preparation. O

We O
were O
9 O
people O
and O
we O
took O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of O
30€, O
something O
retouched. O

Excellent O
cherry B-TARGET
gazpacho, I-TARGET
and O
one O
for O
each. O

Then O
came O
the O
“Machillons B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Escabeche I-TARGET
Fritos I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Olive I-TARGET
Oil I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Chips”, I-TARGET
sounded O
very O
well, O
but O
we O
were O
“surprised” O
with O
bottle O
cheeks O
in O
scabeche O
with O
potatoes O
matutano, O
to O
share O
three O
plates. O

Were O
they O
bad? O

No, O
they O
were O
actually O
good, O
but O
it’s O
not O
what O
you O
expect O
in O
a O
tasting B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

I O
think O
there O
needs O
to O
be O
more O
elaboration. B-TARGET

We O
continue O
with O
the O
lottery. O

We O
were O
9, O
and O
they O
took O
12 O
croquettes... B-TARGET
How O
did O
we O
eat O
1 O
croquette O
and O
1/3 O
each? O

It O
has O
no O
sense. O

They O
were O
very O
good, O
however. O

We O
follow O
with O
the O
fried B-TARGET
chips, I-TARGET
the O
filler B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
(excellent, O
but O
scarce), O
the O
Charly B-TARGET
eggs I-TARGET
and O
the O
Iberian B-TARGET
carrier, I-TARGET
all O
very O
good O
but O
again, O
scarcely, O
very O
scarce, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
a O
dining O
person O
like O
us O
(and O
so O
we O
had O
announced O
it O
by O
phone). O

They O
explained O
that O
they O
take O
1 O
dish O
every O
4 O
people, O
as O
a O
general O
rule. O

What O
if O
you O
are O
9, O
10 O
or O
11 O
people? O

Is O
it O
the O
same O
as O
8? O

We O
made O
it O
known O
to O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
and, O
kindly O
(thank O
you), O
he O
brought O
us O
at O
our O
request O
one O
more O
portion O
of O
croquettes O
and O
another O
of O
Charly O
eggs, O
but O
still.... O

and O
scarce. O

He O
told O
us O
that O
if O
we O
wanted O
more O
than O
we O
asked O
for, O
thank O
you O
again. O

Finally, O
the O
final O
finish, O
a O
chocolate B-TARGET
coulant I-TARGET
the O
size O
of O
a O
flan O
and O
a O
cheese B-TARGET
patch O
the O
size O
of O
a O
yogurt... O
for O
the O
9! O

It’s O
ridiculous, O
I’m O
sorry, O
but O
it’s O
not O
normal O
for O
you O
to O
touch O
a O
spoonful O
per O
person. O

We O
said O
it O
again O
to O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
and O
he O
parked O
the O
kindness, O
despite O
his O
previous O
offer, O
passing O
to O
the O
grotesque O
that O
“that O
was O
so, O
and O
that O
we O
had O
already O
asked O
for O
more,” O
and O
point. O

I O
can O
agree O
with O
the O
bottom O
line O
of O
what O
you O
said, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
free O
buffet, O
but O
never O
in O
the O
forms, O
and O
less O
when O
15 O
minutes O
ago O
you O
offered O
to O
take O
out O
more O
amount O
if O
we O
wanted O
to. O

Lastly, O
it’s O
Drag B-TARGET
Queens I-TARGET
show, I-TARGET
because O
well, O
it O
was O
scheduled O
for O
23:30 O
and O
they O
went O
out O
at O
1, O
so O
that O
sincerely O
we O
didn’t O
have O
much O
humor O
to O
see O
with O
pleasure. O

Not O
even O
with O
the O
wine. O

I O
can O
understand O
30 O
minutes O
of O
delay, O
they O
were O
Pilar O
parties O
and O
so O
they O
do O
more O
box O
with O
the O
drinks, O
but O
1 O
hour O
and O
a O
half? O

It O
is O
not O
acceptable. O

I O
don’t O
wait O
for O
the O
U2 O
for O
1.30 O
hours. O

and O
normal. O

A O
little O
laugh, O
but O
very O
normal. O

We O
went O
to O
rest. O

In O
summary: O
the O
best, O
since O
excellent O
red O
wine B-TARGET
included O
(Vinas O
del O
Vero O
and O
Pago O
Ayles), O
cafes B-TARGET
and O
chupito B-TARGET
also O
within O
the O
menu, O
and O
some O
original O
dishes O
(cerese B-TARGET
gazpacho) I-TARGET
and O
good O
(Charly B-TARGET
eggs, I-TARGET
chipirones, B-TARGET
pasta, B-TARGET
carrillera). B-TARGET

The O
worst O
thing: O
general O
scarcity, O
some O
floating O
dish O
(these O
cheeks...) B-TARGET
and O
a O
reply O
from O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
that O
we O
didn’t O
like O
much. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
kind O
at O
all O
times. O

and O
thanks. O

A O
later O
visit? O

I O
would O
have O
to O
think O
a O
lot. O

and O
a O
greeting. O

Joer O
like O
to O
go, O
to O
my O
no O
se O
me O
rien O
I O
go O
without O
paying O
in O
front O
of O
them O
and O
point, O
they O
go O
out O
to O
the O
street O
to O
look O
for O
me. O

Noted O
the O
expense O
not O
to O
go, O
unless O
the O
owner O
reads O
the O
criticism O
and O
wants O
to O
defend, O
now O
I O
wonder O
that O
it O
can O
be O
defended O
if O
you O
laugh O
at O
everyone O
who O
goes O
to O
his O
local O
never O
know O
who O
is O
a O
good O
customer O
or O
bad. O

Because O
I O
feel O
sorry O
not O
to O
have O
read O
your O
comment O
before O
Pedro, O
because O
I O
would O
have O
saved O
this O
accident, O
we O
saw O
the O
“list” B-TARGET
you O
comment O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
some O
prices O
we O
realized O
that O
they O
were O
also O
a O
theft, O
as O
your O
well O
you O
say, O
I O
don’t O
think O
to O
return. O

I O
visited O
Scala O
about O
a O
year O
ago. O

I O
was O
invited O
to O
this O
restaurant O
of O
which O
I O
did O
not O
know O
its O
existence. O

Nothing O
else O
surprised O
me, O
causing O
me O
a O
good O
impression. O

Local B-TARGET
completely O
new, O
white O
walls, O
all O
very O
clean O
and O
modern. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
correct O
during O
the O
whole O
meal. O

Maybe O
too O
far O
away. O

As O
for O
the O
products, B-TARGET
I O
didn’t O
like O
them O
at O
all. O

They O
weren’t O
bad O
and O
the O
amount O
was O
right, O
but O
they O
didn’t O
leave O
me O
100% O
satisfied. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
quite O
cold, O
there O
was O
something O
missing O
in O
that O
room. O

Despite O
this, O
we O
came O
out O
happy. O

I O
will O
try O
again O
and O
see O
if O
it O
improves. O

We O
came O
back, O
today O
Tuesday, O
June O
18, O
2013, O
after O
a O
year O
approximately, O
for O
a O
celebration, O
and O
the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
site, B-TARGET
is O
that: O
“always O
right.” O

You O
cannot O
put O
another. O

We O
have O
eaten O
wonderfully O
with O
some O
exquisite O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
careful O
elaboration, O
the O
service B-TARGET
in O
its O
proper O
measure O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
; O
the O
authors O
of O
the O
delicacies O
that O
come O
out O
to O
the O
table: O
A O
closed O
ovation, O
the O
turn O
to O
the O
wheel O
and O
the O
two O
ears. O

More O
than O
another O
“belly” O
I O
suggest O
the O
author O
of O
this O
blog, O
the O
“always O
right” O
brand. O

A O
greeting O
and... O

We O
will O
come O
back!! O

(And O
we O
are O
neither O
family O
nor O
friends O
of O
the O
owners, O
eh!, O
but O
people O
who O
value O
the O
work O
well O
done. O

The O
author O
of O
the O
blog O
knows O
this.) O

All O
very O
well O
both O
the O
deal B-TARGET
of O
service, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
very O
rich O
and O
served O
in O
a O
short O
time O
and O
the O
quality-price O
ratio O
very O
well O
too. O

Recommended O
100% O

very O
well. O

is O
recommended. O

Everything O
is O
OK. O

Everything O
was O
perfect, O
as O
they O
had O
our O
reservation B-TARGET
and O
the O
table B-TARGET
we O
had O
asked, O
next O
to O
the O
window O
that O
gives O
to O
Las O
Ramblas. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast. O

The O
DTO O
was O
applied. O

20% O
on O
the O
account. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
passable, O
at O
least O
what O
we O
eat: O
brave B-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
and O
two O
pizzas. B-TARGET

The O
good O
dessert. B-TARGET

We O
were O
already O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
dinner O
pizza, O
and O
we O
were O
surprised O
to O
see O
that O
there O
was O
a O
little O
variety... B-TARGET

In O
general, O
everything O
is O
fine, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
is O
rather O
passable. O

The O
bathroom B-TARGET
is O
a O
disaster. O

Yes, O
it O
is O
true O
that O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
that O
is O
precisely O
why O
they O
would O
have O
to O
be O
more O
rigorous O
in O
cleaning O
the O
bathrooms. B-TARGET

and O
good, O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
price O
ratio. O

We O
were O
in O
the O
upper O
part O
and O
going O
with O
the O
kids O
was O
great O
because O
there O
was O
more O
space. B-TARGET

and O
greetings, O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
pleasant O
and O
helpful!!! O

Very O
recommended O

to O
repeat O

Very O
correct O

Excellent O
renovation B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
food B-TARGET
at O
a O
very O
interesting O
price. O

Insane O
people O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
enter. O

Great O
celebrations O
of O
friends O
with O
the O
very O
affectionate O
owner B-TARGET
in O
the O
deal. O

A O
suitable O
comment O
for O
the O
restaurant O
El O
Candelas: O
It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
people O
who O
are O
used O
to O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
of O
all O
categories, O
it O
costs O
us O
so O
much O
to O
find O
a O
place O
like O
this, O
where O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
extraordinary, O
whether O
the O
daily B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
is O
of O
excellent O
quality O
and O
variety, O
such O
as O
its O
card, B-TARGET
not O
very O
wide O
but O
if O
very O
careful, O
along O
with O
a O
brass O
menu B-TARGET
of O
16 O
Euros O
that O
is O
an O
authentic O
jewelry, O
composed O
of O
a O
stunning O
illustrated B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
a O
dish O
of O
morcilla, O
chorizo O
and O
longaniza O
brasa, O
a O
dish O
of O
cheese, O
and O
choose O
between O
a O
entrecot B-TARGET
of O
excellent O
cottage O
or O
4 O
pieces O
of O
Aragon B-TARGET
ternasco I-TARGET
to O
the O
brasa, O
dessert O
and O
wine O
of O
the O
area, O
simply O
stunning!. O

I O
forgot, O
we O
can O
also O
taste O
the O
best O
buckwheat B-TARGET
of O
Navarre O
that O
you O
can O
find O
in O
Zaragoza, O
I O
can O
not O
stop O
commenting O
also O
on O
its O
extensive O
wine B-TARGET
list O
that O
in O
a O
family O
restaurant O
like O
this O
you O
do O
not O
expect O
to O
find O
so O
much O
quality.Do O
not O
stop O
visiting O
it O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
after O
you O
will O
thank O
you, O
a O
person O
with O
more O
than O
40 O
years O
of O
experience O
in O
hostelry, O
mainly O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
Ana B-TARGET
her I-TARGET
owner I-TARGET
will O
receive O
you O
with O
open O
arms O
and O
her O
kindness O
along O
with O
her O
great O
interest O
in O
the O
customer O
coming O
out O
with O
a O
great O
smile O
and O
want O
to O
return. O

Congratulations, O
you O
have O
a O
great O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
we O
have O
had O
a O
great O
dinner. O

We O
hope O
to O
see O
you O
again. O

Magnificent O
quality O
price O
relationship. O

Very O
high O
quality O
kitchen. B-TARGET

I O
treat B-TARGET
super O
kindly. O

Do O
not O
stop O
behaving O
like O
this. O

A O
hug O
and O
to O
the O
next. O

We O
were O
dining O
on O
Saturday O
with O
four O
people O
with O
a O
fairly O
correct O
treatment. B-TARGET

Home O
food, B-TARGET
as O
in O
the O
family. O

We O
ate O
at O
the O
table, O
tasting O
their O
callos, O
chuletón, O
codornices, O
etc. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
well O
but O
if O
it O
wasn’t O
cold O
from O
the O
fridge, O
it O
would O
taste O
much O
better. O

For O
dessert, B-TARGET
we O
tried O
an O
ice O
cream O
that O
was O
good. O

Write O
your O
comment O
here, O
we O
are O
doing O
a O
great O
job. O

Hi O
Mr O
Ruby. O

In O
order O
to O
improve O
and O
clarify O
what O
happened: O
About O
your O
complaint O
what O
does O
it O
mean O
that O
if O
you O
had O
not O
personally O
presented O
you O
would O
have O
had O
a O
chasco? O

and O
a O
greeting. O

I O
don’t O
have O
a O
special O
meal O
without O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

From O
the O
direction, B-TARGET
going O
through O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
waiters, B-TARGET
the O
treatment O
is O
excellent, O
but O
all O
this O
would O
not O
serve O
nothing O
without O
that O
too, O
as O
is O
so. O

We O
enjoy O
excellent O
product B-TARGET
quality O
and O
an O
excellent O
price O
ratio. O

Congratulations O
and O
thanks O
for O
your O
work. O

All O
very O
well, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
perfect O
if O
any O
of O
the O
chuletons B-TARGET
were O
more O
at O
their O
point, O
because O
they O
served O
us O
too O
much O
past. O

Pleasant O
environment, B-TARGET
good O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
with O
good O
preparation O
and O
presentation. O

Something O
in O
dessert. B-TARGET

All O
very O
well. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I’ve O
been O
there O
and O
I O
feel O
very O
pleasant. O

Service B-TARGET
and O
restoration O
are O
good. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
my O
friends. O

We O
were O
very O
well O
served O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great. O

The O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
correct. O

The O
Triston O
environment. B-TARGET

They O
serve O
you O
too O
fast O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
play O
and O
talk O
while. O

The O
good O
seconds. B-TARGET

The O
first B-TARGET
pica I-TARGET
very O
loose, O
buñuelos B-TARGET
full O
of O
thorns O
and O
bitter O
seitons. B-TARGET

I O
will O
not O
return. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
fine, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
you O
notice O
that O
they O
have O
good O
cooks. O

The O
education O
of O
the O
director B-TARGET
Fernando I-TARGET
grandson, I-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
it O
is O
not O
logical O
that O
while O
one O
enjoys O
his O
meal O
he O
is O
rushed O
to O
eat, O
and O
he O
is O
rushed O
to O
the O
waiters O
in O
the O
room, O
where O
all O
the O
customers O
hear O
his O
screams. O

The O
meters, B-TARGET
the O
two O
sparkles, O
are O
useless. O

It O
is O
no O
longer O
L’Olivé O
de O
la O
rue O
Muntaner. O

It O
has O
been O
mechanized O
in O
excess O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
resented O
by O
it. O

Yes, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
the O
final O
summary. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
like O
the O
cup O
of O
a O
pine. O

Great O
decoration, B-TARGET
great O
food B-TARGET
and O
at O
a O
price O
not O
exaggerated. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
fantastic. O

Unmatched O
attention, B-TARGET
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
but O
the O
most O
unpleasant O
thing O
is O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Fernando B-TARGET
grandson I-TARGET
treat O
his O
staff O
so O
badly. O

Excellent O
quality O
price. O

You’ll O
like O
it O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
well, O
you’ll O
get O
it. O

For O
me O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants B-TARGET
in O
Barcelona O
of O
Mediterranean O
and O
Catalan O
cuisine. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
immeasurable. O

Without O
a O
doubt O
the O
best. O

and O
Hello. O

The O
truth O
is, O
we O
ate O
really O
well O
and O
it O
wasn’t O
expensive. O

Complete O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
great O
service. B-TARGET

I O
definitely O
recommend O
it. O

food B-TARGET
with O
the O
right O
quality O
and O
in O
its O
fair O
proportion O
and O
price O
ay, O
ay, O
full O
wine B-TARGET
letter I-TARGET
and O
well, O
efficient O
professional O
service. B-TARGET

peros: O
decoration O
and O
atmosphere B-TARGET
almost O
retro, O
charge O
for O
bread B-TARGET
that O
did O
not O
order O
and O
service O
2,20 O
€ O
per O
person, O
coca B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
3,20 O
€ O
excessive, O
cafes B-TARGET
to O
2 O
€, O
all O
more O
taxes, O
urinary B-TARGET
service O
men O
with O
graphitis, O
do O
not O
repeat. O

Honestly, O
it O
seemed O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
ate. O

The O
service B-TARGET
needs O
to O
be O
improved. O

Among O
other O
things, O
I’m O
obsessed O
with O
the O
hurry B-TARGET
that O
some O
people O
have O
to O
remove O
their O
dishes O
while O
eating. O

Olive O
should O
not O
fall O
into O
these O
mistakes. O

Great O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
great O
staff. B-TARGET

Perfect O
environment B-TARGET
and O
perfect O
food. B-TARGET

Very O
recommended O

Little O
space O
between O
the O
tables B-TARGET
for O
a O
high-priced O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
illumination. B-TARGET

The O
stairs O
and O
furniture B-TARGET
details, O
dusty O
and O
worn, O
need O
renovation. O

and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
entrance B-TARGET
fee, O
which O
is O
charged. O

I O
like O
their O
food B-TARGET
a O
lot, O
yahe O
went O
several O
times, O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
excessive O
the O
number O
of O
tables B-TARGET
there O
for O
the O
available O
space. O

The O
neighbor O
eats O
at O
your O
table... O
Privacy, B-TARGET
zero. O

I O
see O
that O
the O
opinions O
are O
mostly O
favorable, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
like O
them. O

I O
went O
with O
a O
group O
of O
the O
company, O
we O
were O
narrowed O
and O
took O
mogollon O
to O
serve O
us O
and O
charged O
as O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
first. O

The O
environment, B-TARGET
the O
treatment, B-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
quantity O
can O
be O
qualified O
as O
very O
well. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
can O
be O
a O
bit O
expensive O
but O
you O
come O
out O
with O
the O
feeling O
of O
having O
eaten O
well O
and O
enough. O

It O
combines O
quality, O
service B-TARGET
and O
environment. B-TARGET

is O
recommended. O

Hi O
we O
were O
on O
Saturday O
and O
it O
is O
really O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
ate O
dinner, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
menu O
that O
we O
booked O
on O
its O
day O
the O
degustation O
B O
(26 O
euros O
per O
person) O
did O
not O
have O
it, O
they O
told O
us O
that O
there O
was O
another O
29 O
euros, O
but O
that O
there O
were O
several O
dishes O
missing, O
which O
made O
us O
choose O
the O
35 O
euros O
with O
cup O
included, O
although O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
well O
prepared O
the O
price O
to O
our O
understanding O
is O
high O
and O
the O
rations B-TARGET
for O
two O
people O
are O
scarce. O

As O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
performance B-TARGET
of O
a O
drag O
queen O
very O
entertained, O
we O
do O
not O
rule O
out O
to O
go O
back O
but O
only O
to O
take O
a O
drink O
and O
enjoy O
the O
music. O

A O
very O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
what O
it O
offers. O

We O
took O
a O
salad, O
some O
croquettes O
and O
some O
Charly O
eggs, O
all O
to O
share, O
without O
dessert, O
and O
the O
joke O
came O
out O
to O
us O
25 O
Euros O
per O
person...in O
any O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
eat O
better O
for O
less...And O
the O
show? O

We O
arrived O
at O
21.45h O
(to O
dinner) O
and O
we O
left O
at O
23.30h O
more O
or O
less, O
because, O
well, O
during O
all O
that O
time O
there O
was O
no O
show...where O
is O
then O
the O
dinner-show B-TARGET
that O
they O
announce? O

It’s O
a O
fiasco, O
I O
don’t O
think O
we’ll O
come O
back. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Very O
pleasant O
place B-TARGET

We O
ate O
dinner O
with O
12 O
co-workers O
on O
Friday O
night O
and O
picked O
up O
the O
menu O
for O
20 O
€. O

Everything O
fantastic, O
good O
rations, B-TARGET
quality O
of O
food, B-TARGET
well O
served O
and O
all O
in O
a O
very O
monkey, O
small O
and O
welcoming O
place. B-TARGET

We O
were O
almost O
alone O
and O
we O
were O
very O
happy. O

With O
coffee, O
extra O
wine O
and O
cups O
at O
the O
end O
came O
out O
for O
30 O
€. O

We O
ate O
very O
well. O

Very O
proper O
and O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
small O
but O
very O
welcoming. O

We O
enjoy O
good O
food B-TARGET
at O
a O
good O
price. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
slow. O

Only O
with O
the O
first O
dish, O
they O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
serve O
it O
and O
another O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
serve O
the O
second. O

We O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
even O
though O
quality-price O
is O
a O
bit O
expensive. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
itself O
is O
very O
well O
auqnue O
sometimes O
you O
notice O
the O
smell O
of O
street O
cloaca. O

They O
do O
everything O
they O
can O
to O
make O
it O
not O
noticeable. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
were O
correct. O

The O
negative O
was O
that O
we O
booked O
a O
Friday O
at O
22:30 O
(it O
allowed O
to O
book O
until O
23:00) O
and O
as O
we O
were O
the O
only O
reservation O
that O
night O
they O
called O
me O
that O
same O
afternoon O
to O
see O
if O
we O
could O
go O
at O
21:00. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
affluence O
at O
night O
it O
would O
be O
better O
not O
to O
give O
the O
option O
of O
booking. O

As O
I O
said O
at O
the O
beginning, O
the O
deal O
was O
good. O

It O
smells O
bad O
in O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Lack B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
small O
but O
with O
some O
charm. O

I’ve O
arranged O
the O
dinner O
and O
I’m O
more O
than O
satisfied O
and O
grateful. O

The O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
chef B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
tasty O
and O
well O
elaborated O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
noticed O
and O
tasted O
in O
all O
of O
them. O

We O
ordered O
one O
of O
the O
menus O
they O
have O
prepared O
and O
we O
are O
not O
mistaken. O

In O
addition, O
the O
local B-TARGET
is O
very O
welcoming O
and O
we O
spent O
the O
hours O
flying... O
we O
almost O
crushed O
with O
the O
dinner O
of O
how O
well O
we O
felt O
there. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
those O
who O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
celebrate O
a O
meal O
between O
friends O
or O
at O
work O
and O
also O
to O
couples O
since O
it O
is O
a O
quiet O
and O
pleasant O
place B-TARGET
with O
simple O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
quality. O

We O
have O
been O
delighted; O
very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
pleasant, O
helpful,... O
if O
you O
can O
eat O
at O
the O
window O
table O
with O
views O
of O
the O
square, O
it O
is O
ideal. O

Very O
quiet O
place, B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
it. O

When O
I O
return O
to O
Barcelona, O
I O
will O
repeat. O

Very O
friendly, O
as O
if O
you O
were O
at O
home. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
pleasant O
service. B-TARGET

Something O
expensive, O
but O
the O
card B-TARGET
has O
quite O
a O
variety O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
good. O

We O
will O
repeat!! O

We O
had O
dinner O
on O
Wednesday O
night O
with O
a O
group O
of O
4 O
friends O
and O
we O
all O
loved O
it. O

Very O
welcoming, O
exquisite O
and O
excellent O
treatment. B-TARGET

In O
addition, O
it O
was O
a O
long O
time O
since O
we O
did O
not O
come O
to O
this O
area O
of O
Barcelona O
on O
the O
Born, O
and O
it O
has O
now O
been O
incredibly O
beautiful. O

A O
fantastic O
choice. O

Great O
place B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
magnificent O
experience, O
the O
excellent O
attention, B-TARGET
the O
recommendations O
of O
the O
restaurant O
manager B-TARGET
right, O
a O
rich O
wine. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
that O
anyone O
who O
wants O
a O
good O
meal B-TARGET
put O
himself O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
master. O

very O
well. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
we O
had O
a O
really O
good O
dinner. O

and O
thanks. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
thanks O
to O
super O
friendly O
and O
professional O
waiters. B-TARGET

and O
Fantastic. O

Very O
friendly O
restaurant, B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food. B-TARGET

Many O
thanks. O

Good O
environment B-TARGET
and O
good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

After O
dinner O
we O
continue O
with O
the O
good O
combined. B-TARGET

A O
total O
of O
4 O
hours O
well O
spent. O

Excellent O
treatment, B-TARGET
interesting O
decoration, B-TARGET
good O
genero O
(quality O
of O
food). B-TARGET

Inadequate O
quantity, O
dogs O
are O
not O
allowed O
as O
in O
most O
restaurants O
in O
other O
countries. O

In O
a O
few O
months O
they O
have O
passed O
from O
dishes O
with O
abundant O
and O
excellent O
food O
to O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
just O
rations O
at O
the O
same O
price. O

Wine B-TARGET
prices O
have O
risen O
by O
about O
30%. O

What O
a O
pity, O
it O
has O
gone O
from O
being O
a O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
to O
one O
more O
of O
the O
crowd. O

In O
addition, O
they O
have O
replaced O
the O
choppy O
of O
courtesy O
of O
what O
you O
wanted O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
cava. O

That O
said, O
someone O
has O
thought O
that O
by O
dropping O
food B-TARGET
and O
drink B-TARGET
and O
rising O
the O
prices O
of O
wines B-TARGET
no O
one O
would O
realize, O
but O
the O
clientele O
is O
not O
stupid. O

Very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
next O
to O
the O
market. O

Good O
first O
rations B-TARGET
to O
share O
and O
superb O
merluza O
center O
to B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
board. I-TARGET

The O
account O
of O
40 O
euros O
with O
a O
bottle O
rioja O
reservation, O
very O
recommended. O

A O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
quality-price O
ratio O
very O
good, O
local B-TARGET
with O
careful O
decoration, O
low O
but O
enough O
light B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
well-selected O
musical B-TARGET
thread. I-TARGET

Ideal O
for O
a O
dinner O
in O
a O
couple. O

The O
strawberries B-TARGET
are O
impressive, O
meat B-TARGET
of O
very O
good O
quality O
and O
just O
to O
the O
point O
that O
we O
asked O
for O
it. O

and O
excellent O
treatment. B-TARGET

By O
putting O
a O
stick O
I O
would O
say O
that O
if O
you O
are O
not O
a O
lover O
of O
Rioja B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
you O
do O
not O
have O
much O
more O
to O
choose O
from, O
yet O
the O
selection O
of O
Riojas O
is O
good. O

We O
will O
repeat. O

Yesterday O
we O
had O
a O
grateful O
surprise. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
had O
a O
very O
intimate O
and O
welcoming O
decoration. O

The O
attention B-TARGET
from O
the O
staff O
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
fantastic. O

I O
will O
repeat O
for O
sure. O

The O
recommended O
site. B-TARGET

Well O
prepared O
food. B-TARGET

Take O
me O
a O
rape B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
good O
wine O
sauce O
and O
my O
friends O
who O
ate O
meat B-TARGET
were O
delighted. O

Dinner O
until O
3 O
p.m. O
with O
drinks. O

Lovely O
evening, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Greetings O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
impressive. O

The O
food B-TARGET
we O
find O
is O
unoriginal, O
and O
there O
is O
too O
much O
potato O
in O
every O
dish. O

One O
of O
the O
dishes O
was O
forgotten O
to O
put O
the O
garniture O
on O
the O
card. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
very O
fast, O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
were O
very O
close O
together O
and O
every O
time O
the O
waitress O
passed O
we O
were O
hit O
by O
the O
chair. O

I O
would O
not O
go O
to O
dinner O
again, O
but O
I O
recommend O
it O
for O
drinks. O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day O
and O
although O
the O
first O
dish( O
riggatoni B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
bolognese I-TARGET
) O
seemed O
a O
little O
squeezed O
(very O
good, O
but O
little O
amount), O
the O
second O
dish O
served O
it O
with O
a O
good O
meat O
dish O
and O
along O
with O
the O
dessert, O
we O
went O
out O
well O
satiated O
from O
the O
restaurant. O

Both O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
and O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
was O
impolite, O
so O
we O
left O
with O
a O
magnificent O
sensation. O

I O
highly O
recommend O

Last O
Saturday O
we O
tried O
to O
celebrate O
the O
Christmas O
dinner O
with O
our O
team. O

The O
experience O
has O
been O
bad. O

I’ll O
explain O
it O
to O
you O
so O
you O
don’t O
have O
to O
read O
it O
all O
if O
you O
don’t O
want O
to. O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
or O
an O
enemy. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
agreed O
and O
paid O
in O
part O
in O
advance O
has O
not O
corresponded O
with O
what O
they O
have O
served O
(“it O
has O
been O
a O
mistake,” O
they O
say O
in O
the O
complaint). O

The O
food B-TARGET
they O
have O
served O
has O
been O
scarce O
in O
quantity, O
served O
without O
style O
or O
affection O
and O
we O
have O
had O
to O
endure O
that O
they O
serve O
pieces O
of O
meat B-TARGET
completely O
frozen, O
without O
finishing O
cooking. O

The O
dessert, B-TARGET
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
miniature O
contest. O

They O
say O
they O
were O
good, O
I O
didn’t O
try O
them O
because O
there O
were O
fewer O
desserts B-TARGET
than O
people... O

The O
drink B-TARGET
has O
left O
to O
desire O
in O
all O
respects, O
it O
has O
been O
little O
and O
has O
not O
included O
any O
beers, O
so O
we O
have O
had O
to O
pay O
an O
extra O
(not O
small, O
because O
cheap O
is O
not) O
to O
be O
able O
to O
finish O
the O
menu O
with O
liquid O
with O
which O
to O
make O
a O
“rissot” O
that O
would O
have O
made O
the O
delights O
of O
the O
presentator O
of O
Bricomanía, O
in O
the O
chapter O
in O
which O
it O
explains O
how O
to O
sketch O
old O
walls. O

And O
the O
best O
(with O
all O
the O
irony O
that O
I O
can O
do O
without O
missing O
or O
insulting) O
service. B-TARGET

They O
have O
tried O
to O
charge O
us O
more O
menus O
than O
they O
consumed, O
they O
have O
not O
proposed O
any O
compensation O
to O
correct O
the O
long O
list O
of O
errors O
they O
have O
recognized O
and O
now O
we O
have O
not O
even O
managed O
to O
get O
the O
invoice O
with O
the O
total O
of O
the O
“party”. O

A O
whole O
list O
of O
wretches O
that O
have O
made O
our O
Christmas O
dinner O
a O
nightmare O
chapter O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

If O
you O
don’t O
want O
to O
get O
bitter O
unnecessarily, O
try O
any O
other O
restaurant O
in O
the O
area. O

No O
matter O
how O
bad O
it O
is, O
it O
will O
be O
better O
than O
this O
one. O

Honest O
and O
cordial O
greetings. O

[...] O
building O
street O
and O
two O
restaurants O
on O
the O
upper O
floor, O
which O
are O
accessed O
by O
a O
staircase. O

One O
restaurant O
is O
the O
Colette O
and O
another O
the O
Q-Art. O

Al O
Colette O
is O
identified O
by O
its O
creators O
as O
a O
“high O
[...] O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
clarification O
Pedro, O
if O
you O
use O
only O
this O
trend O
in O
dish O
presentation O
I O
don’t O
care, O
if O
you O
use O
genetically O
altered O
products O
I O
would O
thank O
you O
so O
much, O
it O
seems O
that O
it O
is O
not O
the O
case. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
restaurant O
in O
addition O
to O
good O
cuisine. O

I O
came O
out O
very O
burned O
from O
my O
visit O
to O
the O
q-art, O
but O
your O
criticism O
re-thinks O
about O
the O
possibility O
of O
passing O
through O
the O
Colette. O

and O
a O
greeting. O

The O
other O
day O
dinner O
in O
colette O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
is O
already O
missing O
a O
retaurant B-TARGET
like O
that O
in O
Zaragoza. O

The O
impressive O
start, O
the O
same O
service B-TARGET
and O
attention O
with O
so O
much O
snack O
that O
it O
is O
not O
even O
normal O
of O
good, O
is O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
to O
all O
friends O

I O
love O
that O
site, B-TARGET
which O
generally O
does O
not O
disappoint, O
but O
on O
Saturday O
it O
did: O
they O
gave O
me O
a O
table O
for O
3 O
for O
then, O
4 O
hours O
later, O
cancel O
it O
and O
reboot O
me O
to O
RISKOMAR, O
where O
we O
ate O
fatal O
(I O
have O
already O
left O
an O
opinion). O

Not O
serious O
that O
they O
confirm O
availability O
to O
then O
cancel O
it O
and O
derive O
you O
to O
another O
of O
the O
Group. O

Disappointment, O
as O
in O
her O
day O
was O
that O
the O
waitress O
did O
not O
know O
the O
vodka O
MOSKOS. O

In O
my O
opinion O
it O
is O
an O
impressive O
restaurant, B-TARGET
both O
in O
decoration, B-TARGET
comfort B-TARGET
and O
not O
in O
service B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

This O
last O
one O
is O
the O
best O
of O
all O
both O
in O
stage O
as O
well O
as O
in O
quality O
and O
quantity, O
here O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
topic O
of O
going O
to O
eat O
a O
snack O
for O
you O
to O
get O
hungry. O

To O
be O
sure, O
my O
score O
is O
10. O

The O
first O
impression O
of O
coming O
in O
is O
very O
positive. O

Great O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
stage. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
not O
surprising. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
up O
to O
date. O

The O
only O
real O
high O
is O
the O
price. O

My O
score O
would O
be O
7. O

They O
need O
to O
improve O
if O
they O
want O
to O
keep O
paying O
for O
that. O

That O
in O
allusion O
to O
the O
comments O
of O
someone O
who O
makes O
up O
my O
person O
using O
my O
name O
and O
making O
criticisms O
towards O
this O
restaurant. O

I O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
your O
opinions. O

The O
Colette O
Restaurant. O

With O
a O
trip O
to O
Zaragoza O
we O
dined, O
advised O
by O
the O
hotel, O
at O
the O
Colette O
restaurant. O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
of O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
is O
pretentious O
and O
that O
is O
far O
from O
being O
the O
innovative O
and O
quality O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
they O
advertise. O

The O
price O
ratio O
is O
very O
poorly O
adjusted. O

Surprisingly, O
you O
also O
get O
paid O
for O
the O
sweets B-TARGET
that O
serve O
accompanying O
the O
coffee O
and O
that O
we O
had O
not O
requestedReally O
have O
a O
lot O
to O
learn. O

It O
is O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
not O
to O
remember O
and O
not O
to O
advise. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
would O
be O
the O
only O
thing O
to O
highlight. O

As O
for O
the O
food, B-TARGET
well O
but O
nothing O
exclusive O
or O
surprising. O

In O
Zaragoza O
there O
are O
many O
restaurants O
with O
the O
same O
quality O
and O
even O
better. O

What O
is O
really O
unfortunate O
is O
the O
service B-TARGET
they O
offer: O

It O
took O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
out O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine, O
after O
three O
waiters B-TARGET
had O
asked O
for O
it. O

- O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
bread O
is O
spent, O
do O
not O
take O
out O
more, O
no O
matter O
how O
much O
you O
ask O
and O
insist.-the O
waitresses B-TARGET
offered O
us O
a O
regrettable O
treatment, O
even O
came O
to O
shout O
us O
and O
demand O
silence O
(we O
were O
fifteen O
people, O
so O
it O
is O
normal O
to O
whisper). O

Honestly, O
it’s O
been O
the O
worst O
service B-TARGET
I’ve O
ever O
been O
offered, O
and O
that, O
in O
a O
restaurant O
like O
this, O
is O
unforgivable. O

They O
looked O
like O
tavern O
waiters O
in O
a O
three-bedroom O
restaurant. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend. O

We O
have O
been O
three O
times O
in O
the O
spa, O
and O
we O
find O
it O
great, O
comfortable O
rooms, O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
the O
very O
beneficial O
waters O
for O
people O
with O
skin O
or O
respiratory O
problems, O
we O
will O
return. O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
kindness O
of O
all O
employees. B-TARGET

<->The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
slow, O
especially O
for O
groups O
that O
work O
with O
a O
rather O
narrow O
schedule. O

The O
staff, B-TARGET
however, O
is O
very O
friendly. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good, O
the O
arroces B-TARGET
excellent O
in O
general. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
impressive O
and O
with O
very O
good O
prices. O

Excellent O
and O
abundant O
food. B-TARGET

The O
truth O
a O
good O
option O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
Barcelona O
to O
enjoy O
a O
good O
dinner. O

We O
were O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
and O
we O
fought O
a O
lot, O
volvereoms O

I O
didn't O
know O
you O
and O
on O
Saturday O
day O
5,09 O
I O
was O
dining O
with O
the O
group O
of O
Singles O
Bcn O
and O
it O
was O
a O
real O
disaster, O
it O
wasn't O
fulfilled O
with O
what O
was O
exposed O
in O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
the O
"horrible" O
service B-TARGET
I O
would O
almost O
say O
rubbing O
the O
bad O
education, O
it O
was O
a O
pity, O
the O
whole O
group O
of O
the O
table O
remained O
unwilling O
to O
return. O

On O
Sunday O
we O
were O
eating O
with O
the O
family O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
children I-TARGET
is O
thankful O
because O
it O
is O
complete O
and O
at O
a O
good O
price, O
The O
card B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
the O
rye B-TARGET
very O
well O
as O
well O
as O
desserts. B-TARGET

The O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
was O
at O
all O
times O
impeccable. O

Excellent O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
centre O
of O
Barcelona, O
A O
paella B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
bogavante I-TARGET
that O
we O
will O
remember O
as O
good O
wines B-TARGET
very O
well. O

Quiet O
pleasant O
and O
children O
do O
not O
bother O
with O
a O
good O
children's O
menu B-TARGET
a O
good O
choice O
for O
the O
whole O
family. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
group O
dining O
last O
Saturday O
and O
everything O
was O
perfect, O
food, B-TARGET
service, B-TARGET
atmosphere B-TARGET
we O
will O
return. O

The O
price O
ratio O
of O
the O
best. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
infumable. O

Camareros B-TARGET
despistados: O
we O
had O
to O
share O
a O
rice O
because O
being O
4 O
pointed O
3, O
brought O
account O
of O
another O
table, O
discussions O
between O
camarers... O

The O
right O
food. B-TARGET

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
last O
Friday O
and O
we O
were O
welcomed O
with O
a O
cup O
of O
rosé O
cava, O
the O
letter B-TARGET
is O
the O
most O
varied O
and O
we O
very O
much O
like O
a O
salt B-TARGET
lubin I-TARGET
that O
we O
recommended, O
the O
camarers B-TARGET
very O
nice. O

Excellent O
chocolate B-TARGET
dessert. O

I O
booked O
for O
1.01.07 O
and O
when O
I O
arrived O
they O
didn’t O
have O
it O
pointed O
out. O

Neither O
my O
own O
nor O
one O
of O
my O
friends. O

They O
arrived O
before. O

We O
were O
also O
not O
told O
that O
the O
menu O
was O
closed O
that O
day. O

We O
went O
without O
eating. O

I O
have O
been O
several O
times O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
several O
reasons: O
good O
quality O
price O
relationship, O
quick O
and O
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
location B-TARGET
(near O
Pl.Urquinaona) O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
exquisite. O

Totally O
recommended O
for O
any O
event: O
family, O
friends O
and O
couple O

The O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
make O
a O
proposal O
for O
improvement: O
The O
waiters B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
were O
too O
stressed O
and O
took O
quite O
a O
while O
to O
attend O
us, O
so O
if O
they O
put O
another O
waitress O
or O
the O
kitchen-room B-TARGET
logistics I-TARGET
system I-TARGET
was O
better O
designed, O
the O
customers O
would O
be O
served O
more O
promptly. O

Heat O
in O
the O
area B-TARGET

<+>Relation O
of O
quality O
to O
price O

Great O
environment B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

I O
like O
the O
menu B-TARGET
very O
much. O

Not O
to O
stay O
hungry. O

The O
50% O
discount O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
good O
price. O

Very O
correct O

I O
think O
the O
title O
says O
it O
all. O

Reservation O
for O
2 O
people O
at O
14.30. O

A O
cup O
of O
cava. O

We O
arrived O
on O
time. O

A O
considerable O
standing O
wait B-TARGET
(long O
tail). O

I O
try O
to O
find O
a O
table O
up O
and O
down. O

In O
the O
end, O
they O
find O
one O
by O
chance O
in O
an O
uncomfortable O
corner. B-TARGET

Above O
my O
head O
I O
had O
the O
TV O
screen O
with O
the O
sound B-TARGET
to O
my O
left O
ear. O

Should O
the O
table O
be O
reserved? O

Choosing O
a O
plate. O

I O
ordered O
Raimat O
Chardonay. O

The O
waitress O
asked O
me O
if O
it O
was O
white O
or O
red. O

Chardonay O
is O
a O
white O
grape O
strain. O

My O
first O
dish O
(starred B-TARGET
eggs) I-TARGET
was O
just O
fried O
potatoes O
and O
on O
top O
a O
couple O
of O
fried O
eggs O
(without O
any O
look). O

We O
go O
home O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
path. O

My O
wife O
asked O
for O
salad O
of O
strawberries. O

Three O
or O
four O
strawberries O
fried O
on O
top O
of O
rúcula. O

In O
the O
second, O
we O
both O
asked O
for O
lubin O
to O
salt. O

They O
have O
not. O

They O
offer O
salad O
with O
salsa. O

A O
deep O
dish O
full O
of O
liquid O
with O
two O
pieces O
of O
fish O
(my O
lady O
complained O
since O
that O
wasn’t O
strawberry B-TARGET
and O
what O
was O
super O
frozen). O

There O
is O
no O
quality-price O
relationship. O

We O
asked O
for O
the O
cup O
of O
cava O
that O
was O
offered O
in O
the O
reservation. O

The O
waitress O
had O
no O
idea. O

He O
tells O
the O
maitre O
(I O
think) O
and O
he O
tells O
us O
that O
“good”, O
“if O
they O
want O
cava” O
you O
offer O
them O
two O
copitas O
in O
desserts O
(he O
tells O
the O
waitress). O

My O
dessert O
could O
be O
eaten, O
but O
my O
wife O
asked O
for O
pineapple O
with O
coconut O
ice O
cream. O

The O
pineapple B-TARGET
had O
an O
intense O
garlic O
taste. O

I O
suppose O
they O
cut O
the O
pineapple O
with O
the O
same O
knife O
with O
which O
they O
cut O
the O
garlic. O

After O
all O
this, O
is O
it O
a O
haircut O
or O
not? O

Of O
course O
I’m O
already O
giving O
voices O
to O
warn O
all O
my O
relationships. O

I O
will O
never O
return O
there O
again. O

And O
know O
there O
are O
other O
details O
that O
I O
do O
not O
comment O
on O
so O
as O
not O
to O
extend. O

I O
think O
you O
should O
consider O
keeping O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
your O
website. O

A O
few O
points, O
for O
me, O
to O
be O
corrected: O

- O
I O
booked O
the O
New O
Year's O
gala O
dinner O
online, O
but O
the O
restaurant O
did O
not O
find O
my O
reservation O
and O
the O
price O
was O
10 O
E. O
larger O
(little O
thing: O
I O
ate O
the O
same); O

- O
Could O
be O
better O
organized O
in O
the O
change O
of O
the O
knife, B-TARGET
the O
same O
used O
for O
two O
dishes O
(enter O
and O
main). O

For O
the O
handling O
and O
the O
speed O
of O
the O
service: B-TARGET
praised. O

We O
chose O
the O
menu O
B O
(25 O
euros O
per O
head). O

An O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
to O
bring O
us O
the O
first O
(passed O
the O
first O
hour O
only O
with O
jam O
and O
bread O
with O
tomatoes). O

We O
asked O
for O
a O
reservation O
in O
writing O
and O
by O
phone O
and O
they O
didn’t O
give O
us O
it O
despite O
saying O
that O
ok. O

We O
said O
the O
number O
of O
comensals O
in O
writing O
and O
twice O
by O
phone O
and O
they O
did O
not O
put O
the O
necessary O
chairs. O

A O
real O
disappointment. O

Rice, B-TARGET
in O
very O
generous O
portion O
and O
with O
plenty O
of O
supplements, O
such O
as O
gambas, O
cheeks, O
strawberries O
and O
strawberries. O

We O
could O
not O
finish O
it! O

To O
improve: O
the O
place B-TARGET
where O
the O
portions O
of O
arroces O
or O
fish O
are O
placed. O

All O
very O
correct, O
I O
treat B-TARGET
very O
close O
and O
accurate. O

A O
very O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

and O
congratulations. O

It O
is O
the O
best O
paella B-TARGET
in O
Barcelona. O

A O
little O
hurt O
the O
place. B-TARGET

The O
local B-TARGET
is O
welcoming, O
although O
the O
quality-price O
ratio O
is O
not O
equitable, O
quite O
expensive O
for O
what O
they O
served O
that O
is O
not O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
they O
propose O
in O
the O
offer, O
since O
the O
rice O
was O
going O
to O
be O
bogavante O
and O
they O
did O
it O
from O
cigalas...the O
dessert B-TARGET
very O
scarce, O
only O
two O
truffles O
and O
no O
option O
in O
exchange. O

Drinks B-TARGET
were O
also O
not O
included O
and O
the O
wine B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
is O
of O
high O
prices. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day, O
he O
went O
out O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
as O
eating O
to O
the O
letter O
and O
not O
being O
able O
to O
choose. O

The O
discount O
is O
50%. O

We O
pay O
€18 O
per O
person O
without O
drinks O
for O
a O
tasty O
menu. O

4 O
croquettes, O
2 O
toasted O
potatoes, O
brave O
potatoes, O
an O
incomprehensible O
cheese O
and O
secondly O
we O
ordered O
garlic O
rice. O

Dinner O
with O
2 O
truffles. O

If O
I O
get O
to O

person, O
I O
will O
directly O
file O
a O
complaint. O

In O
general O
lines. O

Good O
quality O
price. O

Only O
we O
are O
disappointed O
that O
from O
the O
extensive O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
they O
only O
had O
the O
fourth O
option O
that O
we O
requested. O

It O
took O
a O
lot O
of O
time, O
a O
lot O
of O
noise, O

without O

As O
for O

it O
does O
not O

the O

For O
the O

at O

what O
I O
tried, O
very O
just, O
almost O
suspended. O

In O
the O

they O
should O
be O
resaca O
because O
I O
ordered O
some O
noodles B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
and O
I O
am O
still O
looking O

What O
really O

me O
was O
the O
quality O
of O
the O

I O
have O
been O

We O

We O
arrived O
on O
the O
22nd O
of O
October, O
a O
modern O
but O
charming O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
dined O
very O
well, O
with O
a O
fair O
price, O
a O
charming O
staff.The B-TARGET
next O
day O
we O
went O
to O
take O
a O
tap O
with O
a O
wine,all O
very O
pleasant O
resultThe O
only O
pega O
that O
I O
would O
put,is O
that O
we O
did O
not O
find O
the O
phone B-TARGET
on O
any O
page O
of O
the O
internet,which O
we O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
without O
knowing O
if O
we O
would O
have O
a O
place. O

We O
were O
enchanted. O

It O
was O
last O
night, O
February O
22, O
2015. O

My O
husband O
asked O
for O
a O
reserved O
only O
for O
us, O
and O
we O
did O
not O
lack O
anything. O

We O
ordered O
a O
tasty O
menu B-TARGET
and O
everything O
was O
delicious. O

Five O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
enough O
amounts O
to O
fill O
you.They O
didn’t O
take O
long O
to O
serve O
us, O
always O
careful O
so O
that O
we O
didn’t O
have O
to O
wait. O

Super O
recommended. O

Only O
a O
small O
detail, O
there O
was O
a O
lack O
of B-TARGET
atmospheric I-TARGET
music I-TARGET
to O
be O
perfect. O

I O
liked O
it O
a O
lot, O
there O
are O
people O
who O
make O
analogues O
with O
the O
Diverxo O
restaurant O
in O
Madrid, O
which O
they O
have O
qualified O
as O
the O
59 O
best O
restaurant O
in O
the O
world... O
saving O
the O
distance O
if O
the O
Gamberro O
was O
in O
Madrid O
I O
think O
we O
would O
see O
it O
with O
other O
eyes, O
my O
congratulations, O
I O
will O
return. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
types O
of O
people. O

My O
partner O
and O
I O
love O
the O
creative O
cuisine, O
we O
have O
tried O
all O
this O
kind O
of O
restaurants O
in O
Zaragoza O
with O
success O
but O
Gamberro O
disappointed O
us O
a O
lot. O

Very O
few O
dishes B-TARGET
even O
for O
a O
tasty O
menu. O

But O
still, O
if O
the O
food O
had O
triumphed, O
it O
would O
have O
given O
us O
the O
same. O

Something O
insípida, O
missed O
a O
touch... O
ultimately, O
we O
didn’t O
like O
it, O
we O
won’t O
come O
back, O
and O
I O
don’t O
recommend O
it. O

We O
went O
to O
make O
a O
family O
celebration O
to O
HOSTERIA O
BOTIN O
DEL O
CORREGIDOR O
in O
c/ O
Josefa O
Amar O
and O
Borbom, O
it O
was O
the O
confirmation O
of O
my O
daughter, O
we O
were O
15 O
people O
and O
we O
really O
came O
out O
very O
satisfied, O
the O
quality O
relationship O
price O
was O
very O
favorable, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
and O
cordial O
and O
the O
dining B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
above O
very O
pleasant. O

I O
really O
recommend O
it O
from O

my O

ISABEL O
AND O
MANOLO O

I O
was O
at O
the O
restaurant O
this O
weekend O
(March O
2009). O

I O
had O
been O
there O
twice O
before. O

This O
was O
the O
third O
and O
last. O

It O
has O
worsened O
significantly. O

They O
have O
taken O
away O
the O
Mexican O
food O
card, O
which O
was O
the O
most O
worthwhile, O
and O
there O
is O
only O
Italian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
of O
very O
basic O
quality. O

I O
ate O
a O
lasagna B-TARGET
and O
was O
very O
poorly O
cooked...I O
think O
those O
that O
sell O
frozen O
in O
the O
super O
are O
better. O

For O
the O
most O
part, O
we O
reduced O
the O
stay O
with O
music B-TARGET
to O
a O
not O
very O
normal O
volume O
of O
Latin O
American O
music...an O
incongruence O
in O
a O
restaurant O
called O
Monasterio O
and O
gives O
Italian O
food. O

I O
said O
it, O
not O
to O
come O
back. O

Now O
there O
is O
a O
buzz. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
closing O
is O
something O
that O
came. O

I O
had O
been O
to O
various O
group O
dinners O
in O
2004 O
and O
2005 O
and O
nothing O
comparable O
to O
what O
I O
found O
in O
January O
2009: O
a O
pessimistic O
attention, B-TARGET
a O
fair O
meal B-TARGET
and O
a O
costly O
price O
for O
what O
I O
received. O

And O
that O
they O
let O
you O
go O
at O
12 O
p.m. O
because O
they O
had O
to O
dine O
on O
the O
day O
before O
the O
King’s O
Day O
has O
their O
grace. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
hospitality O
business, O
you O
have O
to O
act O
accordingly. O

Have O
you O
changed O
owners O
or O
something O
like O
that? O

An O
exceptional O
restaurant, B-TARGET
with O
a O
quality O
of O
impressive O
products, B-TARGET
the O
new O
fish B-TARGET
brought O
from O
San O
SEBASTIAN, O
and O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
in O
few O
restaurants O
you O
eat O
it O
as O
in O
the O
sidreria.volveria, O
as O
long O
as O
you O
can. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
customer O
of O
La O
Kupela O
for O
years O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
they O
have O
always O
kept O
the O
same O
line O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
their O
products. O

Here O
they O
don’t O
fool O
me O
and O
all O
their O
products B-TARGET
are O
first.The O
fish B-TARGET
are O
sensational, O
fresh O
and O
cooked O
without O
sauces O
that O
sometimes O
only O
pretend O
to O
mask O
a O
bad O
product. O

And O
of O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
you O
can O
presume O
to O
be O
the O
best O
meat O
in O
Zaragoza, O
and O
I O
would O
dare O
to O
say, O
of O
the O
best O
in O
Spain. O

If O
people O
want O
to O
fill O
the O
tripa O
at O
a O
cheap O
price, O
of O
course O
La O
Kupela O
is O
not O
for O
them. O

Please O
keep O
doing O
it O
as O
always, O
Zaragoza O
deserves O
first O
restaurant, O
and O
believe O
me, O
there O
are O
very O
few. O

All O
the O
times O
we O
have O
been O
there O
have O
been O
just O
as O
good: O
quality O
and O
proper O
treatment. B-TARGET

Regarding O
the O
price, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
author O
of O
this O
website. O

by O
Alberto O
Frisch O

Good O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
maybe O
the O
price O
is O
sometimes O
a O
bit O
high O
but O
it’s O
worth O
trying O
their O
meats. B-TARGET

Too O
expensive O
for O
the O
current O
times. O

If O
they O
don’t O
go O
ahead, O
they’ll O
lose O
customers. O

Their O
very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
excellent O
food, B-TARGET
a O
very O
nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
but O
the O
price O
is O
a O
bit O
high O
for O
the O
quality O
they O
offer. O

A O
great O
dinner, B-TARGET
the O
impeccable O
service, B-TARGET
the O
fabulous O
food, B-TARGET
a O
wide O
list B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
and O
a O
perfect O
dessert. B-TARGET

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
spacious, O
comfortable O
and O
well-conditioned. O

As O
we O
went O
with O
Argentine O
friends O
we O
made O
a O
pica B-TARGET
pica I-TARGET
first O
so O
that O
they O
tried O
typical O
Catalan O
dishes... O
they O
were O
delighted. O

The O
right O
and O
right O
price O
for O
food. B-TARGET

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
the O
salad. B-TARGET

Good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

Very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
but O
unusually O
slow. O

is O
recommended. O

Very O
recommended O

One O
of O
the O
best O
Argentines O
in O
Barcelona. O

Fantastic, O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good O
but O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
amazing, O
so O
the O
food O
knows O
even O
better!! O

Good O
attention, O
correct O
suggestions O
and O
good O
quality. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
without O
a O
doubt, O
we O
still O
have O
a O
lot O
to O
try... O
Congratulations O
continue O
like O
this! O

I O
will O

Jmarcoj, O
what O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
“so O
does O
the O
Iberian O
dam O
not O
present”? O

In O
the O
explanations O
given O
in O
the O
Herald O
of O
Aragon O
on O
the O
merits O
of O
Michelin O
stars, O
reference O
was O
made O
to O
a O
customer O
attention O
and O
a O
quality O
in O
service O
and O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
dishes O
constant O
in O
time. O

I O
was O
in O
March O
and O
in O
principle O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
the O
conversations O
of O
the O
tables O
were O
heard O
and O
bothered O
but O
what O
didn’t O
seem O
well O
was O
the O
quality O
failure O
in O
customer O
care, B-TARGET
I O
explain: O
We O
asked O
for O
the O
tasting O
menu O
and O
when O
we O
asked, O
a O
detail, O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
make O
some O
food O
that O
we O
didn’t O
like, O
we O
told O
him O
that O
in O
the O
dishes O
that O
were O
made O
at O
the O
time O
they O
didn’t O
put O
salt.In O
one O
of O
the O
dishes O
they O
took O
fresh O
foie O
to O
the O
plate O
full O
of O
fat O
salt O
and O
when O
we O
made O
the O
observation O
they O
apologized O
but O
did O
not O
offer O
to O
rework O
it O
without O
salt, O
it O
doesn’t O
seem O
correct O
to O
me O
first O
to O
show O
the O
little O
attention B-TARGET
that O
is O
given O
to O
the O
requests O
of O
customers O
that O
are O
distributed O
in O
5 O
tables O
and O
second O
by O
the O
cutre O
of O
not O
rectifying O
the O
error. O

They O
offered O
us O
three O
first, O
an O
exquisite O
risotto B-TARGET
and O
two O
other O
dishes O
that O
would O
be O
very O
rich O
but O
out O
because O
they O
wrapped O
them O
with O
orange B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
eggs I-TARGET
that O
with O
their O
strong O
taste O
and O
being O
kept O
in O
salt O
masked O
the O
taste O
of O
originating O
from O
the O
dishes.I O
don't O
know O
if O
it O
was O
a O
coincidence O
to O
add O
eggs O
to O
the O
two O
dishes, O
but O
if O
they O
didn't O
do O
it O
to O
finish O
the O
latte, O
repeat O
twice O
and O
over O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
something O
very O
salty O
when O
we O
mentioned O
the O
question O
of O
salt O
and O
that O
the O
dishes O
could O
have O
been O
served O
without O
the O
eggs. O

It O
was O
good, O
but O
it O
disappointed O
us O
on O
a O
special O
day. O

[...] O
Restaurant O
Bal O
d’Onsera O
in O
Zaragoza,ins O
its O
Michelin O
star O
during O
2010.[...] O

Sincerely O
I O
see O
it O
correct O
with O
the O
explanations, O
but O
for O
my O
taste O
it O
is O
a O
barbarity O
to O
pay O
170 O
euros O
per O
couple O
for O
the O
presented O
accounting O
that O
there O
were O
no O
cafes, O
and O
respect O
since O
it O
has O
a O
Michelin O
star, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
give O
the O
right O
to O
charge O
for O
star, O
place O
or O
person O
with O
whom O
you O
have O
learned, O
the O
kitchen O
is O
an O
art, O
a O
taste O
and O
a O
way O
to O
present O
a O
work, O
so O
it O
is O
difficult O
for O
many O
people O
to O
know O
it. O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
restaurants O
are O
for O
tasting O
what O
you O
eat, O
drink, O
talk, O
and O
have O
a O
little O
dessert.Restaurants O
have O
to O
have O
that O
encouragement, O
because O
it’s O
like O
going O
to O
the O
cinema O
and O
you O
can’t O
laugh, O
cry, O
or O
sleep O
in O
the O
worst O
of O
cases. O

Likes O
for O
everyone, O
but O
it O
will O
be O
hard O
to O
see O
me O
in O
places O
like O
this, O
I O
wish O
you O
the O
best. O

Thanks O
for O
your O
chronicle, O
it O
has O
been O
of O
great O
help O
to O
me O
to O
decide O
where O
NOT O
to O
go O
to O
celebrate O
a O
special O
dinner, O
I O
will O
leave O
my O
place O
for O
experienced O
gastronomic O
critics. O

Thank O
you O
for O
being O
so O
independent O
and O
so O
sincere O
in O
your O
chronicles. O

I’m O
sure O
you’re O
not O
Aragonese, O
you O
don’t O
understand O
the O
formula. O

What O
can O
be O
a O
fatiguing O
mental O
exercise O
for O
you, O
doesn’t O
have O
to O
be O
it O
for O
others. O

However, O
I O
am O
looking O
forward O
to O
knowing O
the O
coefficients O
and O
parameters O
valued. O

And O
already O
by O
the O
way, O
know O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
return O
without O
touching O
the O
moor. O

Mr. O
Gonzalo O
López O
Madrazo.I O
agree O
with O
your O
appreciations, O
I O
also O
don’t O
like O
to O
be O
bothered O
by O
asking O
you O
how O
the O
food O
was, O
almost O
always O
questions O
rhetorically, O
and O
say O
“very O
well”, O
“perfect, O
thank O
you”. O

What O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
is O
that O
it O
is O
not O
central, O
for O
me O
it O
is O
in O
the O
best O
area B-TARGET
of O
the O
city, O
between O
the O
Plaza O
del O
Pilar O
and O
the O
Plaza O
de O
España, O
in O
the O
tube, O
an O
authentic O
meolo O
of O
Zaragoza O
full O
of O
centuries O
of O
history. O

“Absolutely O
nothing. O

The O
environment B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

Everything O
perfect O

and O
genius! O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
average O

Varied O
charter: B-TARGET
Eggs B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
foie, I-TARGET
calçots B-TARGET
and O
meat B-TARGET
in O

To O
say O
something... O

Desserts B-TARGET
can O
be O
improved. O

We O
had O
a O
reservation O
for O
a O
shoe. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
we O
had O
never O
tried O
it O
and O
we O
didn’t O
know O
how O
to O
eat O
them O
and O
one O
of O
the O
waiters O
put O
on O
some O
gloves O
and O
showed O
us O
it. O

They O
were B-TARGET
all I-TARGET
very I-TARGET
kind O
and O
attentive. O

The O
quality O
and O
quantity O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

Very O
pleased O
with O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it O

First O
we O
ordered O
asparagus B-TARGET
and O
served O
it O
cold O
with O
cold O
sauce. B-TARGET

We O
did O
not O
like O
it O
too O
much. O

Then O
we O
ordered O
meat B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
good, O
but O
the O
accompaniment B-TARGET
was O
cold O
as O
well. O

I O
got O
the O
dessert. B-TARGET

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
at O
your O
time. O

It O
is O
perfect O
for O
a O
calçotade O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
Barcelona. O

We O
took O
the O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu O
and O
was O
very O
correct O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
repeating O
calçots B-TARGET
and O
the O
drink B-TARGET
included O
without O
limit. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
too. O

We O
were O
15 O
and O
it O
was O
very O
good O
to O
be O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
Barcelona. O

Enjoy O
with O
your O
partner O
a O
very O
modern O
atmosphere B-TARGET
but O
without O
losing O
warmth O
and O
enjoying O
a O
very O
varied O
card B-TARGET
that O
covers O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
preferences O

We O
made O
a O
reservation O
for O
11 O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
everything O
was O
very O
right. O

The O
attention B-TARGET
of O
the O
boss O
excellent, O
punctual O
on O
the O
reservation, O
and O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

I O
ordered O
the O
dressed O
menu. O

Per O
the O
only O
pega O
(for O
my O
taste) O
is O
that O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
large O
(although O
it O
is O
true O
that O
you O
were O
allowed O
to O
repeat O
calçots B-TARGET
and O
that O
almost O
everyone O
was O
full O
already). O

The O
calçots B-TARGET
are O
rich O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
very O
good O
as O
well. O

If O
you O
organize O
something O
in O
a O
group O
and O
want O
to O
stay O
well O
with O
the O
beginners, O
I O
definitely O
recommend O
it. O

We O
ordered O
the O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu O
and O
everything O
was O
very O
good...the O
very O
nice O
restaurant...the B-TARGET
only O
thing O
are O
the O
tables B-TARGET
a O
little O
small O
and O
too O
together O
so O
you O
do O
everything O
well. O

is O
recommended. O

For O
a O
family O
problem O
I O
had O
to O
cancel O
the O
reservation, O
timely O
communicating O
the O
matter O
to O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
restaurant, B-TARGET
used O
in O
previous O
occasions, O
is O
very O
good: O
good O
quality-price O
ratio, O
impeccable O
attention B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
and O
perfect O
cleaning O
of O
kitchen-dining-service. O

Very O
recommended. O

Very O
pleasant O
place. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
very O
well O
(in O
making O
the O
reservation O
we O
made O
note O
that O
it O
was O
an O
anniversary, O
and O
we O
were O
placed O
in O
a O
romantic O
corner O
and O
we O
were O
gifted O
with O
2 O
cups O
of O
cava). O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
simple, O
well O
prepared O
and O
well O
presented. O

The O
quality-price O
ratio O
is O
good. O

This O
is O
a O
place O
I O
have O
on O
my O
agenda. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
rich O
and O
varied O
in O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

is O
recommended. O

The O
menu O
of O
calçotada B-TARGET
seemed O
to O
us O
the O
most O
complete O
and O
the O
relationship O
quality O
price O
very O
high O
besides O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
price. O

Excellent O
treatments, B-TARGET
good O
quality O
price O
ratio, O
abundant O
and O
offer O
to O
repeat O
in O
concerted O
menu. O

There O
is O
a O
fish B-TARGET
menu. O

We O
spent O
a O
good O
night O
celebrating O
the O
21 O
years O
of O
cou O
promotion. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
service, B-TARGET
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
repeating O
dishes B-TARGET
from O
the O
menu. O

A O
good O
option O
at O
low O
cost. O

Honestly, O
I O
can’t O
say O
anything O
better O
than O
to O
assure O
you O
that O
I’ll O
be O
back. O

Excellent O
quality-price O
relationship. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
well O
cooked. O

9.5 O
by O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
for O
3 O
people, O
very O
complete O
this O
menu, B-TARGET
in O
relation O
quality O
price O
very O
good. O

Yesterday O
I O
went O
with O
two O
friends O
to O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
truth O
treated O
us O
super O
well, O
they O
had O
the O
table O
ready O
even O
though O
we O
arrived O
late. O

They O
were O
quick, O
the O
list B-TARGET
is O
varied O
and O
the O
products B-TARGET
good, O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
totally O
recommended. O

The O
food B-TARGET
very O
well, O
but O
if O
something O
stands O
out O
above O
everything, O
it O
is O
the O
very O
careful O
treatment O
of O
all O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
to O
which O
you O
see O
with O
desire O
that O
all O
this O
is O
good O
for O
the O
customer. O

We O
will O
repeat O
it O
without O
hesitation. O

If O
I O
had O
to O
put O
some O
but, O
this O
would O
be O
just O
as O
we O
were, O
but O
I O
understand O
that O
with O
a O
group O
of O
18 O
and O
on O
a O
day O
of O
kings, O
it O
shouldn’t O
be O
easy O
to O
locate. O

The O
booking O
service O
offered O
by O
Central O
Reservations O
perfect. O

The O
restaurant O
called O
me O
to O
confirm O
the O
reservation O
and O
the O
table O
and O
time O
were O
fully O
adjusted O
to O
the O
required. O

Normal O
food, B-TARGET
some O
products O
are O
better O
than O
others. O

Fast, O
comfortable O
and O
effective. O

is O
correct O

We O
were O
all O
pleased O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good. O

We O
changed O
the O
menu O
that O
was O
announced. O

Dinner B-TARGET
was O
very O
well O
recommended. O

All O
right O
for O
the O
level O
of O
people O
there O
were. O

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
presentation, O
along O
with O
proper O
care. B-TARGET

is O
recommended. O

Excellent O
description O
Fernando, O
I O
had O
understood O
that O
La O
Matilde O
was O
quite O
more O
expensive, O
it O
is O
good O
to O
know O
that O
for O
that O
price O
you O
can O
eat O
there. O

I O
was O
two O
weeks O
ago, O
I O
returned O
after O
2 O
years O
(then O
I O
wondered) O
but O
now O
in O
2010 O
I O
saw O
it O
a O
little O
left, O
I O
was O
not O
surprised O
at O
all O
and O
the O
impression O
it O
gave O
me O
is O
that O
they O
had O
little O
variety O
to O
choose O
from. O

It O
was O
all O
good, O
but O
I O
don’t O
think O
I’ll O
go O
a O
third O
time. O

In O
terms O
of O
quality-price O
and O
within O
its O
category, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view, O
it O
must O
be O
one O
of O
the O
reference O
restaurants B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza. O

His O
exquisite O
experience, O
professionalism, O
service B-TARGET
and O
treatment O
provide O
a O
hardly O
unparalleled O
added O
value O
at O
this O
time. O

His O
direction B-TARGET
achieves O
overwhelmingly O
what O
I O
understand O
he O
wants. O

The O
one O
who O
is O
going O
to O
eat, O
go O
when O
he O
is O
going, O
already O
knows O
what O
will O
be O
found: O
first O
quality, B-TARGET
unique O
cellar, B-TARGET
renewed O
letter B-TARGET
but O
no O
surprises, O
polite O
treatment, B-TARGET
pleasant O
and O
inviting O
you O
to O
return O
before O
you O
have O
gone. O

Even O
if O
it’s O
the O
first O
time O
you O
visit O
them, O
they O
leave O
you O
with O
the O
feeling O
of O
always O
knowing O
them. O

In O
short, O
it O
is O
a O
charm. O

(Al O
it O
may O
seem O
an O
exaggerated O
comment, O
it O
is O
not O
and O
I O
clarify, O
I O
am O
not O
a O
family, O
but O
a O
simple O
customer O
who O
thanks O
for O
the O
quality B-TARGET
and O
good O
treatment B-TARGET
received.) O

Very O
recommended O
restaurant, B-TARGET
excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O

and O
good O
days. O

The O
process B-TARGET
was O
correct O
in O
all O
respects. O

The O
table O
was O
prepared O
and O
the O
menu O
agreed O
via O
Web O
planned O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
use O
the O
service O
and O
it O
seems O

Very O

We O

The O

We O

Magnificent O

of O
all O
those O

that O
turn O
into O
art O
the O
mere O
primary O
needs O
of O

A O
reduced B-TARGET

from O
a O

well O

a O

for O
everyone O

A O
greeting O

Restaurant B-TARGET
of O
American O
cuisine O
with O
regular O
quality. O

If O
the O
dining O
rooms O
are O
not O
very O
full O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
are O
not O
bad. O

The O
problem O
comes O
when O
they O
are O
filled, O
since O
they O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
staff B-TARGET
to O
serve O
them.This O
restaurant O
is O
located O
next O
to O
the O
Romareda O
football O
field. O

And O
the O
days O
that O
have O
gone O
the O
thing O
is O
still O
worse O
due O
to O
the O
influx O
of O
customers O
and O
the O
clear O
lack O
of O
staff. B-TARGET

One O
of O
these O
days O
my O
experience O
was O
entirely O
negative O
since O
apparently O
one O
of O
the O
owners O
or O
commissioned O
entered O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
screams O
could O
be O
heard O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
when O
the O
local O
was O
full. O

Generally O
not O
recommended O
if O
you O
do O
not O
know O
what O
days O
the O
Zaragoza O
plays O
at O
home O
or O
is O
very O
crowded. O

It O
is O
a O
region O
in O
which O
there O
is O
no O
lack O
of O
hostel O
offer O
with O
better O
quality. O

A O
few O
weeks O
ago O
I O
was O
walking O
around O
the O
area O
of O
the O
Romareda O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
my O
son. O

When O
we O
saw O
the O
Pasta O
City O
retailer O
and O
decided O
to O
stay O
to O
eat. O

The O
appearance O
of O
the O
local B-TARGET
is O
a O
poor O
imitation O
of O
the O
typical O
American O
fast O
food O
restaurants. O

And O
since O
most O
of O
it O
is O
glassy O
and O
it O
was O
a O
hot O
day, O
chickens O
could O
almost O
be O
squeezed O
in O
the O
dining B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
without O
the O
need O
for O
a O
oven. O

We O
decided O
to O
stay O
anyway. O

We O
asked O
for O
the O
letter, O
and O
our O
surprise O
is O
that O
they O
brought O
us O
three O
cards, O
including O
the O
dessert O
one. O

We O
think, O
well, O
at O
least O
we O
will O
have O
variation. O

Variety O
yes, O
but O
in O
the O
book. O

Why O
in O
practice, O
from O
our O
first O
choice O
of O
dishes. O

They O
did O
not O
have O
two. O

Included O
something O
as O
elementary O
and O
basic O
as O
an O
entrecot. O

We O
were O
recommended O
some O
brass O
coatings, O
and O
we O
took O
care O
of O
the O
waitress.First, O
to O
go O
picking O
a O
variety O
of O
onions, O
nugets O
and O
some O
mozzarella O
rebounds O
with O
various O
sauces O
like O
those O
you O
can O
find O
in O
any O
supermarket. O

Served O
in O
a O
small O
bowl. O

And O
secondly O
a O
children's O
menu O
for O
the O
small, O
composed O
of O
a O
hamburger O
with O
potatoes O
and O
the O
recommended O
costillars, O
along O
with O
two O
refreshments O
and O
a O
beer.At O
this O
height O
of O
my O
opinion O
I O
think O
it's O
enough O
to O
say O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
does O
not O
stop O
being O
the O
typical O
of O
a O
franchise O
of O
this O
type O
but O
in O
bad. O

All O
with O
boat O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
frozen O
products. B-TARGET

Let’s O
say O
that O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
have O
a O
great O
Chef O
in O
the O
kitchen.The O
bill O
was O
excessive O
for O
the O
type O
of O
food, B-TARGET
the O
quality O
and O
the O
quantity. O

We O
paid O
64 O
euros.The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
also O
to O
say O
that O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
we O
were O
four O
and O
the O
guitar. O

My O
experience B-TARGET
is O
negative O
and O
I O
will O
not O
return. O

Any O
other O
local O
with O
special O
menu O
is O
best O
priced O
and O
their O
food O
is O
homemade O
and O
more O
fresh. O

I O
take O
note O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

You’ll O
see O
when O
he O
tells O
my O
father O
that O
he’s O
whipped O
to O
his O
mouth. O

A O
greeting O
and O
congratulations O
on O
this O
wonderful O
page, O
friend. O

02-12-2012 O
we O
chose O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
the O
comments, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
Great O
Disappointment. O

We O
are O
four O
comensals O
and O
we O
have O
ordered: O
Jamon B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
(we O
are O
told O
it O
is O
5J) O
for O
us O
we O
understand O
that O
by O
the O
stairs O
it O
was O
lost O
some. O

Horticulars, B-TARGET
fatal O
seemed O
to O
be O
eating O
sand O
on O
the O
beach. O

Puntillitas, B-TARGET
although O
with O
a O
certain O
taste O
to O
requemed O
oil O
were O
acceptable. O

Rice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Señorito, I-TARGET
a O
real O
disaster, O
passed O
crumbled O
and O
the O
cook O
fell O
the O
boat O
of O
pepper O
from O
the O
straw O
smoked, O
impossible O
to O
eat. O

Besugo B-TARGET
al I-TARGET
orrio, I-TARGET
Incomestible O
(soft O
or O
past) O
with O
an O
odor O
of O
vinegar O
impossible O
to O
endure.All O
this O
we O
give O
it O
in O
full O
mouth O
and O
without O
tapes, O
we O
are O
of O
eggs, O
almaria O
and O
badajoz, O
everything O
we O
ask O
we O
know O
to O
perfection O
and O
the O
serving O
resembles O
reality O
like O
an O
egg O
to O
a O
castagne. O

By O
the O
way, O
they O
had O
the O
prudence O
not O
to O
charge O
us O
the O
besugu O
but O
if O
the O
rice. O

And O
finally O
the O
wines B-TARGET
out O
of O
price O
(Pesquera O
crianza O
30€) O
but O
in O
good O
condition O
(without O
poses) O
was O
not O
pica... O

These O
comments O
are O
merely O
to O
put O
the O
batteries O
on, O
but O
if O
anyone O
asks O
me, O
I O
will O
NOT O
recommend O
it O
to O
MY O
worst O
enemy. O

Greetings O

Hello, O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
pillar O
12 O
October, O
we O
will O
eat O
a O
group O
of O
friends, O
almost O
all O
of O
us O
like O
fish O
and O
seafood O
a O
lot O
but O
my O
wife O
does O
not O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
“grace”, O
my O
doubt O
is O
that O
such O
is O
the O
offer O
of O
meats..ect...what O
more O
offers O
there...thank O
you O
for O
anticipated O
a O
greeting,Jose O
carlos O

Hello O
Jose O
Carlos: O
in O
the O
second O
tasting O
menu O
you O
can O
choose O
meat O
(I O
don't O
remember O
if O
entrecot O
or O
salmon) O
or O
the O
fresh O
fish O
you O
have, O
I O
have O
always O
eaten O
fish O
but O
sure O
the O
meat O
is O
of O
good O
quality O
too. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
tasting O
menu, O
you O
can O
also O
order O
a O
regular O
card O
that O
is O
of O
all O
the O
usual. O

and O
a O
greeting. O

Pedro: O
I O
fear O
that O
you O
have O
not O
tried O
the O
appropriate O
Aragon O
cavas O
like O
the O
Cava O
Monastery O
of O
Veruela O
or O
the O
Reinante, O
or O
the O
Real O
of O
Aragon,... O
any O
of O
these O
quality O
price O
ratio O
is O
above O
the O
Catalan. O

I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
Aragonese O
cavas: O
Bordejé, O
Bordejé O
chardonnay, O
Monastery O
of O
Veruela, O
Crown O
of O
Aragon,... O
and O
all O
those O
I O
have O
tried O
so O
far O
leave O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
from O
my O
humble O
point O
of O
view. O

Above O
all, O
they O
lack O
freshness O
and O
fruitfulness O
and O
tend O
to O
sin O
from O
a O
certain O
harvesting. O

A O
very O
notorious O
exception, O
the O
Lalanne O
cellar O
(Lucrecia O
Lalanne O
brut O
nature) O
I O
have O
not O
tried O
neither O
Reinante O
nor O
Real O
of O
Aragon. O

I O
assure O
you O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
have O
the O
opportunity, O
I O
will O
try O
them O
and O
here O
I O
will O
give O
you O
the O
reason O
in O
case O
I O
like O
them. O

Very O
nice O
environment, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Great O
food B-TARGET
and O
attention. B-TARGET

By O
chance O
my O
partner O
and O
I O
ended O
up O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
they O
offered O
us O
the O
card O
and O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day, O
we O
decanted O
for O
the O
menu. O

First O
splashed O
of O
pulp O
and O
toast O
and O
black O
olives O
with O
scabies O
scabies O
and O
second O
duck O
magret O
with O
sauce O
of O
melocotón O
and O
cous-cous O
and O
albóndigas O
of O
ternasco, O
the O
truth O
we O
came O
out O
very O
happy O
as O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
a O
great O
quality-price B-TARGET
ratio. I-TARGET

We O
didn’t O
know O
him, O
but O
we O
got O
back. O

This O
place O
is O
very O
recommended O
for O
its O
food B-TARGET
and O
for O
how O
beautiful O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is. O

A O
very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
well O
cooked O
and O
presented. O

I O
recommend O
it. O

Quality O
of O
food B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
table O
service, B-TARGET
were O
shown O
very O
attentive O
at O

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
although O
the O
“carp” B-TARGET
is O
fairy. O

The O
service B-TARGET
very O
fair, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
a O
bit O
decadent, O
and O
both O
the O
paella, B-TARGET
as O
the O
fideuá, B-TARGET
flavorless, O
prefabricated O
and O
almost O
incompatible. O

Bad, O
we O
will O
not O
come O
back. O

A O
great O
Christmas O
day. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
was O
very O
varied O
and O
abundant, O
and O
the O
products B-TARGET
had O
a O
lot O
of O
quality. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
perfect. O

There O
were O
many O
waiters, B-TARGET
worrying O
that O
no O
one O
missed O
anything O
and O
felt O
comfortable. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
to O
enjoy O
this O
restaurant O
with O
Majuscules. O

Friendly O
roommates, B-TARGET
appreciable O
food, B-TARGET
not O
exceptional, O
fair O
price... B-TARGET
terrifying B-TARGET
noise, I-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
people O
around O
to O
get O
places...which O
annoys O
more O
than O
necessary O

A O
bit O
expensive O

goodly O

Very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

An O
excellent O
organization. B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
love O
the O
fish B-TARGET
in O
Salamanca! O

Always O
very O
cool O
(normal!) O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
speaks O
all O
languages. O

That’s O
why O
I O
come O
back O
every O
year! O

Only O
the O
pink O
wine B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
medium. O

Generally O
all O
right. O

We O
went O
on O
Sunday O
to O
celebrate O
my O
70th O
birthday O
with O
my O
children O
and O
friends. O

Excellently O

Good O
attention O
from O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
even O
though O
he O
carried O
too O
many O
tables O
and O
cost O
him O
to O
get O
his O
attention O
to O
ask O
for O
something. O

The O
imperial B-TARGET
marshmallow I-TARGET
is O
impressive, O
although O
we O
served O
it O
a O
little O
cold. O

If O
you O
choose O
marshmallow, B-TARGET
do O
not O
ask O
for O
anything O
as O
an O
entrance O
(the O
waiter O
recommended O
us O
to O
choose O
an O
entrance O
that O
came O
along O
with O
the O
marshmallow, O
and O
it O
cost O
us O
to O
finish O
with O
it) O

We O
were O
on O
Christmas O
Day. O

He O
did O
not O
find O
out O
our O
online O
booking, O
and O
we O
were O
commented O
that O
it O
was O
better O
to O
contact O
them O
directly. O

On O
the O
table B-TARGET
that O
they O
prepared O
for O
us, O
water O
fell O
from O
the O
roof, O
and O
we O
were O
attached O
to O
the O
heating. O

Of O
the O
8 O
Christmas O
menus, B-TARGET
available O
only O
1...it O
is O
true O
that O
we O
eat O
well, O
but O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
of O
humor. O

My O
father O
and O
my O
brother O
have O
been O
eating O
once O
a O
week O
to O
Salamanca O
for O
many O
years O
(between O
weeks) O
because O
they O
feel O
like O
at O
home O
and O
in O
general O
my O
whole O
family O
likes O
them O
a O
lot. O

Regarding O
the O
service O
I O
disagree O
with O
the O
criticism O
below, O
both O
Silvestre O
(trainable) O
and O
its O
entire O
team O
treat O
all O
its O
beginners O
exceptionally, O
which O
coupled O
with O
the O
beauty O
of O
all O
its O
salons O
makes O
you O
feel O
in O
a O
special O
place. O

The O
last O
time O
I O
was O
in O
January O
with O
a O
job O
commitment O
and O
in O
these O
cases O
I O
always O
go O
there O
because O
it O
is O
a O
safe O
bet. O

The O
imperial O
marshmallow O
is O
excellent O
although O
if O
you O
don’t O
want O
to O
throw O
so O
high O
the O
fish O
and O
seafood O
grill O
is O
another O
very O
good O
option. O

Its O
arroces O
are O
remarkable O
and O
the O
permanent O
detail O
of O
the O
santiaguiña O
and O
the O
orange O
bottles O
on O
the O
table O
is O
appreciated. O

<-> O
I O
do O
not O
know O

<+>Well O
communicated O
and O
comfortable O

Expensive O
for O
what O
they O
eat, O
very O
tight O
tables B-TARGET
and O
a O
lot O
of O
noise. O

and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
paella B-TARGET
floats. O

Very O
very O
tourist. O

Good O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
centre O
of O
Barcelona O
on O
the O
sea. O

I O
was O
eating O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
we O
took O
some O
very O
recommended O
entrances, B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
a O
Paella O
Perelada. O

Everything O
perfect O
and O
as O
always, O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
safe O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
go O
and O
always O
repeat O
its O
traditional O
dishes. B-TARGET
