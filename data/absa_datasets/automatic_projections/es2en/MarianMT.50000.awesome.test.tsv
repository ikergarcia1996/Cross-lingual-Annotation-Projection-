The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty. O

Whoever O
loves O
meat O
has O
a O
wide O
enough O
card B-TARGET
to O
choose O
from, O
although O
yesterday O
they O
didn't O
have O
pimpon. B-TARGET

The O
only O
thing O
that O
surprised O
us O
is O
that O
the O
starters O
and O
the O
main O
dishes O
served O
us O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

Buff, O

I O
don't O

where O
to O
start! O

I O
liked O

a O

So O
k O
you O
want O
to O

it O
phenomenal, O
that O
you O
wait. O

Book O

Thank O

Whenever O

Unspeakable! O

Excellent O

Sorrentinos!). B-TARGET

The O

is O
very O
nice O

the O

very O

attentive. O

We O

I O
was O
with O
my O
partner O
on O
April O
10th, O
celebrating O
my O
birthday O
the O
day O
before. O

We O
went O
to O
9R B-TARGET
for O
an O
opinion O
on O
this O
very O
page O
that O
put O
it O
very O
well, O
and O
we O
totally O
agree O
with O
that O
view. O

In O
9R B-TARGET
we O
were O
treated O
great, O
Julio B-TARGET
was O
attentive, O
cordial O
and O
fun, O
he O
treated O
us O
wonderfully O
just O
like O
the O
others. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
elegant, O
tastefully O
decorated, O
for O
putting O
a O
stick O
I O
think O
the O
lighting B-TARGET
(2nd O
floor) O
is O
very O
strong, O
they O
could O
put O
a O
light O
softer O
or O
warmer.... O
this O
would O
be O
the O
only O
stick O
that O
I O
can O
put O
them O
and O
it O
is O
a O
silly O
pq O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
deal B-TARGET
is O
a O

we O
were O
invited O
to O

for O
no O
reason! O

We'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure!!! O

100% O

an O
excellent O

excellent O

The O
divine O
food. B-TARGET

We O
were O
having O
dinner O
and O
we O
loved O
everything. O

The O
space B-TARGET
very O
relaxing, O
colors O
that O
make O
the O

sober. O

The O

of I-TARGET
impeccable O

The O
best O

The O

of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
incoming I-TARGET

A O

The O

The O
best O
meat B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
eaten O
in O
Barcelona. O

Better O
beef B-TARGET
from O
BCN. O

Spectacular O
involves, B-TARGET
I O
needed O
to O
eat O
real O

after O
the O

Excellent O

and O

- O
we O
will O
return! O

Towards O
a O
cold!! B-TARGET

No O
need O
for O
ice O
in O
the O

We O
made O
a O
few O
varied O
starters, B-TARGET
quite O
good! O

based O
on O
empanadilla, B-TARGET
chorizo B-TARGET
and O
others. O

Then O
Salomillo. O

Unlike O
other O
Argentines, O
if O
you O
ask O
him O
alive O
they O
bring O
him O
alive, O
and O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

The O
very O
cordial O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
the O
cozy O
and O
modern O
place. B-TARGET

Ideal O
for O
dinners O
from O
4 O
to O
8 O
people. O

All O
right, O
actually. O

Darin O
would O
be O
proud O
(if O
he O
isn't O
already) O

A O
beautiful O
place B-TARGET
his O
spectacular O
view, B-TARGET
his O
letter B-TARGET
very O
expensive O
in O
prices, O
not O
recommended O
for O
what O
you O
eat, O
his O
maitre B-TARGET
very O
badly O
faced, O
his O
waiter B-TARGET
very O
distracted, O
much O
noise. O

Very O
slow O
service, B-TARGET
mediocre O

and O
expensive O

Not O

Excellent O

Waiters B-TARGET
very O

Unkind O

Receptionists B-TARGET
very O
well. O

Very O
good O

but O
too O
boisterous. O

Price O
a O

high. O

Excellent O
situation. B-TARGET

right O
restaurant O
of O
the O
other O
olive O
line, O
etc. O

perfect O
location B-TARGET
in O
both O
summer O
and O
winter. O

It O
eats O
very O
well, O
for O
years O
we O
go O
and O
we O
always O
liked O
its O
cuisine, B-TARGET
very O
attentive. O

the O
menu B-TARGET
seems O
very O
complete O
but O
I O
would O
add O
to O
it O
something O
like O
stewed O
rabbit O
or O
turkey/chicken O
baked, O
and O
when O
at O
dessert, B-TARGET
it O
seems O
very O
good O
to O
me, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
restaurants O
with O
the O
most O
amount O
of O
dessert O
and O
very O
varied, O
congratulate O
them O
without O
more O
than O
reference O
I O
greet O
them O
and O
I O
hope O
soon O
to O
visit O
your O
restaurant O
until O
later. O

It O
is O
certainly O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants O
in O
Barcelona O
for O
its O
quality O
both O
in O
the O
product, B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
care O
of O
all O
detail O
of O
its O
template. B-TARGET

All O
care O
and O
approved O
by O
the O
meticulous O
eye, O
elegant, O
tireless O
worker, O
and O
professional O
of O
his O
conductor; O
Don B-TARGET
Ramón I-TARGET
Ferreira. I-TARGET

Little O
maitre B-TARGET
kindness. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
not O
attentive O
for O
the O
exorbitant O
price... O

An O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
business O
meal. O

We O
went O
to O
lunch O
with O
the O
company O
last O
week O
and O
it O
was B-TARGET
all I-TARGET
fantastic. I-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

Excellent O
quality O
price O
and O
well O
located. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located O
and O
a O
magnificent O
terrace O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
has O
a O
lot O
to O
desire. O

Never O
order O
rap B-TARGET
with O
sauce O
or O
casserole. O

In O
rice B-TARGET
they O
will O
be O
very O
good O
but O
in O
rape B-TARGET
I O
do O
not O
believe O
it. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
located. O

The O
quality O
of O
shrimp B-TARGET
in O
particular O
is O
fantastic. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
normal O
meal. B-TARGET

The O
staff B-TARGET
should O
be O
more O
attentive O
to O
the O
clientele. O

The O
average O
per O
person O
is O
50 O
euros. O

Eating O
or O
dining O
at O
Barceloneta O
is O
a O
guarantee O
of O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
good O
location. B-TARGET

Careful O
service. B-TARGET

Tempo B-TARGET
between O
right O
plates. O

Rapidness B-TARGET
in O
request O
plates O
and O
simplicity O
counts. O

Dinners O
in O
one O
hour O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
great O
for O
its O
atmosphere O
and O
privileged O
situation, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
correct O
and O
attentive, O
it O
related O
quality O
price, O
good O
quality, O
quantity O
portions B-TARGET
somewhat O
paqueñas O
and O
expensive O
price, O
given O
the O
current O
times. O

Exquisite O
food B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
treatment. B-TARGET

A O
little O
expensive. O

Typical O
for O
tourists, O
deafening B-TARGET
scream O
and O
unprofessional. O

<->I O
haven't O
found O
anything O
negative O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
a O
while. O

<-> O
I O
only O
ask O
you O
to O
remain O
the O
same O
and O
not O
to O
lower O
that O
extraordinary O
level O
of O
"excellence". O

The O
extraordinary O
quality O
of O
the O
product, B-TARGET
especially O
fish B-TARGET
and O
seafood. B-TARGET

Optimal O
homogeneity. O

I've O
been O
many O
times, O
I've O
recommended O
it O
to O
family, O
friends O
and O
close O
friends O
and O
never O
let O
anyone O
down. O

It's O
always O
the O
same O
as O
"excellent". O

A O
lot O
of O
tourists O
and, O
therefore, O
too O
much O
noise. O

In O
general O
it O
maintains O
the O
quality O
of O
its O
dishes B-TARGET
but O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list O
are O
too O
high. O

To O
my O
taste, O
the O
moll B-TARGET
paella I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
rellotge O
is O
at O
the O
right O
point. O

A O
restaurant O
that O
I O
would O
qualify O
as O
safe O
value O
in O
terms O
of O
cooking B-TARGET
but O
improved O
in O
service B-TARGET
though O
without O
being O
disastrous O
at O
all. O

The O
day O
you O
discover O
it O
becomes O
part O
of O
its O
decoration!!! O

Very O
nice, O
impeccable O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
close, O
we O
had O
a O
great O
time. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
because O
of O
the O
good O
references O
I O
had O
received O
and O
it O
did O
not O
disappoint O
me. O

Careful O
attention B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food B-TARGET
quality. O

No O
problem O
with O
booking O
made O
through O
this O
WEB. O

We O
really O
ate O
very O
well, O
we O
enjoyed O
it. O

Everything O
was O
just O
as O
we O
expected O
and O
we O
had O
been O
told, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere, O
without O
a O
doubt O
a O
restaurant O
where O
to O
go O
when O
you O
want O
everyone O
to O
be O
happy. O

A O
good O
choice. O

Excellent O
restaurant O
with O
special O
attention B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Since O
time O
allowed O
they O
reserved O
us O
a O
table O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
very O
well O
arranged O
and O
located. O

It's O
highly O
recommended. O

Suitable O
for O
all O
types O
of O
ages O
but, O
in O
our O
opinion, O
advisable O
for O
older O
than O
30 O
years O
or O
older O
either O
couples O
or O
groups. O

Ideal O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
celebrate O
a O
special O
event. O

Food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
of O
quality, O
although O
the O
price O
is O
high. O

<->Nothing O
to O
highlight O

Unbeatable O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET

Excellent O
food, B-TARGET
but O
scarce O
staff B-TARGET
when O
the O
restaurant O
is O
full. O

It O
took O
them O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
bring O
in O
the O
bill, O
ordered O
several O
times. O

I O
repeat, O
excellent O
food. B-TARGET

We've O
frequented O
this O
restaurant O
on O
several O
occasions. O

But O
today O
will O
be O
the O
last. O

The O
starters B-TARGET
are O
fine, O
but O
the O
broth O
rice B-TARGET
I O
gave O
it O
back O
because O
it O
had O
no O
taste O
at O
all. O

They O
brought O
me O
another O
one O
and O
according O
to O
the O
waitress O
they O
changed O
one O
ingredient. O

(they've O
put O
more O
salt O
in O
it.) O

Very, O
very O
bad O
service. B-TARGET

They O
serve O
the O
wine O
watering O
the O
whole O
table. O

We O
hadn't O
finished O
the O
starters O
yet O
and O
they O
were O
already O
coming O
to O
remove O
the O
plates O
to O
put O
the O
second O
one. O

It O
seemed O
as O
if O
they O
wanted O
us O
to O
leave O
immediately, O
so O
that O
we O
could O
fill O
the O
table O
again.For O
dessert, O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
above, O
there O
was O
a O
political O
event O
campaigning O
(with O
speakers), O
which O
I O
was O
not O
interested O
in O
the O
least. O

Anyway, O
I've O
been O
charged O
the O
same. O

I'm O
not O
coming O
back O
anymore. O

The O
broth B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
didn't O
have O
enough O
to O
be O
a O
good O
rice. O

Very O
loose. O

The O
rest O
is O
fine. O

The O
site B-TARGET
has O
seemed O
very O
well O
located, O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
attention O
very O
good, O
as O
a O
suggestion O
a O
little O
more O
generosity O
in O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

I O
loved O
the O
same O
thing O
as O
the O
three O
companions O
who O
accompanied O
me. O

The O
food, B-TARGET
presentation B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
very O
good. O

Food B-TARGET
and O
exceptional O
views. B-TARGET

The O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
recommendable. O

the O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
has O
been O
great.The O
very O
cozy O
place B-TARGET
of O
impeccable O
taste. O

The O
service B-TARGET
very O
attentive O
and O
very O
fast. O

You O
barely O
had O
to O
wait O
between O
plates. O

Insurmountable O
food, B-TARGET
fresh, O
tender, O
the O
presentation B-TARGET
very O
original O
and O
creative. O

I O
loved O
it. O

Write O
your O
comment O
here... O

All O
right! O

It O
has O
been O
all O
perfect!, O
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
treat! B-TARGET

Lights O
and O
shadows O
in O
my O
expected O
first O
visit O
to O
Meccano. B-TARGET

It O
is O
an O
original O
and O
attractive O
place, B-TARGET
but O
in O
short, O
and O
sticking O
to O
the O
food, B-TARGET
it O
remains O
scarce O
in O
quantity O
and, O
in O
some O
of O
the O
dishes, O
in O
quality O
or, O
rather, O
in O
elaboration. O

We O
were O
9 O
people O
and O
we O
took O
the O
30€ O
tasting B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
somewhat O
retouched. O

The O
gazpacho B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
excellent O
cherries, O
and O
one O
for O
each. O

Then O
came O
the O
“Mejillones B-TARGET
en I-TARGET
Escabeche I-TARGET
Fritos I-TARGET
en I-TARGET
Aceite I-TARGET
de I-TARGET
Oliva I-TARGET
y I-TARGET
Chips, I-TARGET
” O
it O
sounded O
very O
good, O
but O
we O
were O
“surprised” O
with O
pickled O
mussels O
of O
canned O
potatoes, O
to O
share O
three O
small O
plates. O

Were O
they O
bad? O

No, O
they O
were O
actually O
good, O
but O
it's O
not O
what O
you O
expect O
on O
a O
tasting B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

I O
understand O
there O
has O
to O
be O
more O
elaboration. B-TARGET

We O
continue O
with O
croquette O
lottery. O

There O
were O
9, O
and O
they O
took O
out O
12 O
croquettes... B-TARGET
how O
do O
we O
eat O
1 O
croquette O
and O
1/3 O
each? O

It O
doesn't O
make O
sense. O

They O
were O
very O
good, O
though. O

We O
continue O
with O
fried B-TARGET
chips, I-TARGET
stuffed B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
(excellent O
but O
scarce), O
Charly B-TARGET
eggs I-TARGET
and O
Iberian B-TARGET
cheeks, O
all O
very O
good O
but O
again, O
NEAR, O
VERY O
NICE, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
a O
eating O
person O
like O
us O
(and O
we O
had O
announced O
it O
by O
phone). O

They O
explained O
that O
they O
take O
out O
1 O
dish O
every O
4 O
people, O
as O
a O
general O
rule. O

What O
if O
you're O
9, O
10 O
or O
11 O
people? O

You O
get O
what O
you O
get O
from O
eight? O

We O
made O
it O
known O
to O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
and, O
kindly O
(thanks), O
he O
took O
us O
to O
our O
request O
one O
more O
ration O
of O
croquettes O
and O
another O
one O
of O
Charly O
eggs, O
but O
still.... O

It's O
tight. O

He O
told O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
more O
to O
ask, O
thank O
you O
again. O

Finally, O
the O
final O
auction, O
a O
chocolate B-TARGET
coulant I-TARGET
the O
size O
of O
a O
flan O
and O
a O
cheese B-TARGET
jar I-TARGET
the O
size O
of O
a O
yogurt O
— O
by O
9! O

Ridiculous, O
I'm O
sorry, O
but O
it's O
not O
normal O
for O
me O
to O
touch O
you O
one O
teaspoon O
per O
person. O

We O
told O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
again O
and O
he O
parked O
the O
kindness, O
despite O
his O
previous O
offer, O
going O
to O
the O
rudeness O
that O
“that O
was O
so, O
and O
that O
we O
had O
already O
asked O
for O
more”, O
and O
period. O

I O
can O
agree O
with O
the O
bottom O
of O
what O
he O
said, O
it's O
not O
a O
free O
buffet, O
but O
never O
in O
the O
forms, O
and O
less O
when O
15 O
minutes O
ago O
you O
offered O
to O
take O
out O
more O
if O
we O
wanted O
to. O

Finally, O
it's O
Drag B-TARGET
Queens I-TARGET
show, I-TARGET
well, O
it O
was O
scheduled O
for O
23:30 O
and O
they O
went O
out O
at O
1, O
so O
honestly O
we O
didn't O
have O
much O
humor O
to O
see O
it O
with O
pleasure. O

Not O
even O
with O
the O
wine O
ingested. O

I O
can O
understand O
30 O
minutes O
late, O
it O
was O
Pilar's O
parties O
and O
so O
they O
make O
more O
box O
with O
the O
drinks, O
but O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half? O

It's O
not O
acceptable. O

I O
don't O
even O
wait O
1.30 O
hours O
for O
the O
U2s. O

Normal. O

Some O
laugh, O
but O
very O
normal. O

We O
left O
on O
break. O

In O
summary: O
the O
best, O
well O
excellent O
red O
wine B-TARGET
included O
(Viñas O
del O
Vero O
and O
Pago O
Ayles), O
coffees B-TARGET
and O
shot B-TARGET
also O
within O
menu, O
and O
some O
original O
dishes O
( O
gazpacho B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
cherries I-TARGET
) O
and O
good O
( O
eggs O
Charly, B-TARGET
chipirones, B-TARGET
pasta, B-TARGET
gallera B-TARGET
). O

The O
worst: O
general O
shortage, O
some O
loose O
dish O
(those O
mussels...) B-TARGET
and O
an O
answer O
from O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
that O
we O
did O
not O
like O
very O
much. O

The O
waitress, B-TARGET
by O
the O
way, O
was O
very O
kind O
at O
all O
times. O

Thank O
you. O

A O
follow-up O
visit? O

I'd O
have O
to O
think O
about O
it O
a O
lot. O

Say O
hello. O

Joer O
to O
go, O
don't O
laugh O
at O
me. O
I'm O
leaving O
without O
paying O
in O
front O
of O
them. O

Aimed O
THE B-TARGET
DISPENSE I-TARGET
to O
not O
go, O
unless O
the O
owner O
reads O
the O
criticism O
and O
wants O
to O
defend O
himself, O
now O
I O
am O
surprised O
that O
you O
can O
defend O
yourself O
if O
you O
laugh O
at O
everyone O
who O
goes O
to O
your O
place O
never O
know O
who O
is O
good O
client O
or O
bad. O

For O
I O
am O
sorry O
that O
I O
did O
not O
read O
your O
comment O
before O
Peter, O
because O
I O
would O
have O
saved O
this O
accident, O
we O
saw O
the O
“list B-TARGET
” O
you O
comment O
on O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
some O
prices O
we O
realized O
that O
they O
were O
also O
a O
robbery, O
as O
you O
say, O
I O
am O
not O
going O
back. O

I O
visited O
Scala O
about O
a O
year O
ago. O

I O
was O
invited O
to O
this O
restaurant O
of O
which O
I O
did O
not O
know O
its O
existence. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
came O
in, O
I O
was O
surprised, O
making O
a O
good O
impression O
on O
myself. O

Completely O
new O
premises, O
white O
walls, O
everything O
very O
clean O
and O
modern. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
right O
throughout O
the O
meal. O

Maybe O
too O
distant. O

As O
for O
the O
products, B-TARGET
I O
just O
didn't O
like O
them O
at O
all. O

They O
weren't O
bad O
and O
the O
amount O
was O
right, O
but O
they O
didn't O
leave O
me O
100% O
satisfied. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
cold, O
something O
was O
missing O
in O
that O
room. O

Despite O
this, O
we O
were O
happy. O

I'll O
try O
to O
repeat O
and O
see O
if O
they're O
getting O
better. O

We O
have O
returned, O
today O
Tuesday, O
June O
18, O
2013, O
after O
about O
a O
year, O
for O
a O
celebration, O
and O
the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
site, B-TARGET
is O
that: O
“always O
correct”. O

You O
can't O
put O
another O
one O
on. O

We O
have O
eaten O
excellently O
with O
exquisite O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
a O
careful O
elaboration, O
the O
service B-TARGET
in O
its O
right O
measure O
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
; O
the O
authors O
of O
the O
delights O
that O
come O
out O
to O
the O
table: O
A O
closed O
ovation, O
the O
return O
to O
the O
ring O
and O
the O
two O
ears. O

More O
than O
another O
“cachirulo” O
I O
suggest O
the O
author O
of O
this O
blog, O
the O
“always O
correct” O
brand. O

A O
greeting O
and... O

We'll O
be O
back!!!! O

(and O
we O
are O
neither O
family O
nor O
friends O
of O
the O

eh!, O
but O
people O
who O
value O
the O

well O

the O

All O

Recommended. O

All O

Everything O
was O
perfect, O
as O
they O
had O
our O
reservation B-TARGET
and O
the O
table B-TARGET
we O
had O
asked O
for, O
next O
to O
the O
window O
overlooking O
Las O

Service's B-TARGET

They O
applied O
the O
date O
to O
us. O

20% O
on O
the O
bill, O
no O
problem. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
passable, O
at O
least O
what O
we O
ate: O
white O
potatoes B-TARGET
and O
two O
pizzas. B-TARGET

Good O
desserts. B-TARGET

We O
were O
already O
going O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
having O
pizza, O
and O
we O
were O
surprised O
to O
see O
that O
there O
was O
little O
variety... B-TARGET

In O
general O
all O
good, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
pizzas B-TARGET
is O
rather O
passable.... O

The O
sink B-TARGET
a O
little O
messy... O

Yes O
it O
is O
true O
that O
there O
were O
many O
people, O
but O
precisely O
why O
they O
would O
have O
to O
be O
more O
rigorous O
in O
cleaning O
the O
bathrooms. B-TARGET

Hello. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
price-relationship. O

We O
were O
at O
the O
top O
and O
going O
with O
the O
kids O
was O
great O
because O
there O
was O
more O
room. B-TARGET

Greetings, O

Delicious O
food B-TARGET

very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O

To O

Excellent O

A O
proper O
comment O
for O
the O
restaurant O
El O
Candelas: O
It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
people O
who O
are O
used O
to O
going O
out O
to O
eat O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
of O
all O
categories, O
it O
costs O
us O
so O
much O
to O
find O
a O
place O
like O
this, O
where O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
extraordinary, O
either O
the O
daily B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
is O
of O
an O
excellent O
quality O
and O
variety, O
like O
its O
menu, B-TARGET
not O
very O
wide O
but O
if O
very O
careful, O
along O
with O
a O
menu B-TARGET
of O
16 O
Euros O
embers O
that O
is O
an O
authentic O
jewel, O
composed O
of O
a O
great O
illustrated B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
a O
dish O
of O
morcilla, O
chorizo O
and O
longaniza O
brasa, O
a O
dish O
of O
cheese, O
and O
choose O
between O
an O
entrecot B-TARGET
of O
excellent O
veal O
or O
4 O
pieces O
of O
ternasco B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Aragon I-TARGET
to O
the O
grill, O
dessert O
and O
wine O
of O
the O
area, O
simply O
wonderful!. O

I O
forgot, O
we O
can O
also O
taste O
the O
best O
ox B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
in O
Navarre O
that O
you O
can O
find O
in O
Zaragoza, O
I O
can O
not O
fail O
to O
comment O
also O
its O
extensive O
wine B-TARGET
list O
that O
in O
a O
family O
restaurant O
like O
this O
you O
do O
not O
expect O
to O
find O
of O
such O
quality.Do O
not O
stop O
visiting O
and O
you O
will O
surely O
thank O
me O
afterwards, O
tells O
you O
a O
person O
with O
more O
than O
40 O
years O
of O
experience O
in O
hostelry, O
mainly O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
sure O
that O
Ana B-TARGET
its I-TARGET
owner I-TARGET
will O
receive O
you O
with O
open O
arms O
and O
his O
kindness O
along O
with O
his O
great O
interest O
in O
that O
the O
client O
comes O
out O
with O
a O
great O
smile O
and O
desire O
to O
return. O

Congratulations O
you O
have O
a O
great O
restaurant. B-TARGET
We O
have O
had O
a O
wonderful O
dinner. O

We O
hope O
to O
see O
you O
again. O

Maginifica O

High O

I'm O
trying O
super O
nice. O

Don't O
stop O
behaving O
like O
that. O

A O

and O
until O
next O
time. O

We O
were O
having O
dinner O
on O
Saturday O
four O
people O
with O
a O
pretty O
good O
deal. B-TARGET

Homemade O
food, B-TARGET
and O
everything O
as O
a O
family. O

We O
ate O
à O
la O
carte O
testing O
their O
calluses, O
pimples, O
quails O
etc. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
well O
but O
if O
in O
tomato O
it O
was O
not O
cold O
from O
the O
fridge O
would O
have O
much O
more O
flavor. O

For O
dessert B-TARGET
we O
tasted O
a O
mushroom O
ice O
cream O
that O
was O
good. O

Hello, O
Mr. O
Rubira. O

In O
order O
to O
improve O
and O
clarify O
what O
happened: O
About O
your O
complaint O
does O
it O
mean O
that O
if O
you O
had O
not O
personally O
presented O
yourself O
you O
would O
have O
had O
a O
shock? O

Say O
hello. O

I O
haven't O
had O
a O
special O
meal O
lately, O
without O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

From O
the O
direction, B-TARGET
going O
through O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
waiters, B-TARGET
the O
deal O
is O
excellent, O
but O
all O
this O
would O
be O
of O
no O
use O
without O
it O
too, O
as O
it O
is. O

We O
enjoy O
a O
very O
good O
quality O
in O
the O
product B-TARGET
and O
an O
unbeatable O
value O
for O
money. O

Congratulations O
and O
thanks O
for O
your O
work. O

All O
very O
well, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
perfect O
if O
any O
of O
the O
pimps B-TARGET
were O
more O
at O
their O
point, O
because O
they O
served O
us O
too O
much O
past. O

Nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
correct O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
with O
good O
elaboration O
and O
presentation. O

Something O
loose O
in O
desserts. B-TARGET

Everything's O
fine. O

It's O
the O
first O
time O
I've O
gone O
and O
seemed O
very O
nice. O

Service B-TARGET
and O
restoration O
are O
good. O

I'll O
recommend O
it O
to O
friends. O

We O
were O
very O
well O
served O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great. O

The O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
correct. O

Triston O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

They O
serve O
you O
too O
quickly O
and O
waiters B-TARGET
play O
and O
talk O
while O
you're O
at O
it. O

The O
second B-TARGET
good O
ones. O

The O
first B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
sting I-TARGET
very O
loose, O
fritters B-TARGET
full O
of O
thorns O
and O
bitter O
seitons. B-TARGET

I'm O
not O
coming O
back. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
fine, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
you O
can O
see O
they O
have O
good O
cooks. O

The O
education O
of O
the O
director B-TARGET
fernando I-TARGET
grandchild, I-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
it O
is O
not O
logical O
that O
while O
one O
enjoys O
his O
food O
they O
rush O
him O
to O
eat, O
and O
he O
throws O
up O
the O
waiters O
in O
the O
room, O
where O
all O
the O
customers O
hear O
his O
screams. O

The O
pits, B-TARGET
two O
scarecrows, O
they're O
useless. O

It's O
not O
L'Olivé O
from O
Muntaner O
Street O
anymore. O

It O
has O
been O
over-machined O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
resent O
it. O

Yes, O
but O
no, O
it O
would O
be O
the O
final O
summary. O

A O
restaurant B-TARGET
like O
a O
pine O
glass. O

Great O
decoration, B-TARGET
great O
food B-TARGET
and O
at O
an O
unexaggerated O
price. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
fantastic. O

Unmatched O
attention, B-TARGET
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
but O
the O
most O
unpleasant O
thing O
is O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Fernando B-TARGET
grandson I-TARGET
treating O
his O
staff O
so O
badly. O

Excellent O
price O
quality. O

You'll O
like O
it O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
look O
good, O
you'll O
get O
it. O

For O
me O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants B-TARGET
of O
Barcelona O
with O
Mediterranean O
and O
Catalan O
cuisine. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
unbeatable. O

If O
you O
doubt O
the O
best. O

Hello. O

The O

is O
that O
we O

Honestly, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O

for O
what O
we O
ate. O

The O
service B-TARGET
must O
certainly O
improve. O

Among O
other O
things O
I O
have O
an O
obsession O
with O
the O
haste B-TARGET
some O
have O
in O
removing O
the O
table O

Hello O
we O
were O
on O
Saturday O
and O
it O
is O
really O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
dine, O
plus O
the O
menu O
that O
we O
booked O
in O
his O
day O
tasting O
the O
B O
(26 O
euros O
per O
person) O
did O
not O
have O
it, O
they O
told O
us O
that O
there O
was O
another O
of O
29 O
euros, O
but O
that O
there O
were O
several O
plates, O
which O
made O
us O
choose O
the O
35 O
euros O
with O
glass O
included, O
although O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
well O
elaborated O
the O
price O
to O
our O
understanding O
is O
high O
and O
the O
rations B-TARGET
for O
two O
scarce O
people. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
concerned O
it O
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
performance B-TARGET
of O
a O
very O
entertaining O
drag O
queen, O
we O
do O
not O
rule O
out O

only O
to O
have O
a O
drink O
and O
enjoy O
the O
music. O

A O
very O
expensive O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
what O
you O
offer. O

We O
had O
a O
salad, O
some O
croquettes O
and O
some O
eggs O
from O
Charly, O
all O
to O
share, O
without O
dessert, O
and O
the O
joke O
came O
to O
us O
at O
25 O
Euros O
per O
person... O
in O
any O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
eat O
better O
for O
less...And O
the O
show? O

We O
arrived O
at O
21:45 O
(for O
dinner) O
and O
we O
left O
at O
23.30h O
or O
so, O
well, O
during O
all O
that O
time O
there O
was O
no O
spectacle... O
where O
is O
then O
the O
dinner-show B-TARGET
they O
announce? O

Well, O
a O
fiasco... O
I O
don't O
think O
we'll O
be O
back. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET

We O
had O
12 O
co-workers O
on O
Friday O
night O
and O
took O
the O
€20 O
menu. O

Everything O
fantastic, O
good O
rations, B-TARGET
quality O
of O
food, B-TARGET
well O
served O
and O
everything O
in O
a O
very O
cute, O
small O
and O
cozy O
place. B-TARGET

We O
were O
almost O
alone O
and O
very O
comfortable. O

With O
coffees, O
extra O
wine O
and O
drinks O
at O
the O
end O
came O
out O
for O
30 O
€. O

We O
ate O
very O
well. O

The O
service B-TARGET
very O
correct O
and O
attentive. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
small O
but O
very O
cozy. O

We O
enjoyed O
a O
good O
meal B-TARGET
at O
a O
good O
price. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
slow. O

With O
the O
first O
course O
alone, O
it O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
serve O
it O
and O
another O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
serve O
the O
second... O

We O
liked O
it O
quite, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
although O
quality-price O
comes O
out O
something O
expensive. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
itself O
is O
very O
well O
auqnue O
sometimes O
you O
notice O
the O
smell O
of O
sewer O
from O
the O
street. O

They O
do O
everything O
they O
can O
to O
keep O
it O
from O
being O
noticed. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
were O
right. O

The O
negative O
was O
that O
we O
booked O
a O
Friday O
at O
22:30 O
(it O
allowed O
to O
book O
until O
23:00) O
and O
as O
we O
were O
the O
only O
reservation O
that O
night O
I O
was O
called O
that O
afternoon O
to O
see O
if O
we O
could O
go O
at O
21:00. O

If O
you O
don't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
affluence O
at O
night, O
it O
would O
be O
better O
if O
you O
didn't O
have O
the O
option O
of O
booking. O

Otherwise O
as O
I O
indicated O
in O
the O
beginning O
the O
deal O
was O
good. O

Very O
bad O
smell O
in O
the O
restaurants. B-TARGET

List B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
scarce O
wines O

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
too O
small O
but O
with O
a O
certain O
charm. O

I O
organized O
the O
apartment O
food O
and O
I'm O
more O
than O
satisfied O
and O
grateful. O

Both O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
above O
all O
the O
cook B-TARGET
were O
exceptional. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
tasteful O
and O
well O
eaten O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
appreciated O
and O
tasted O
in O
all O
of O
them. O

We O
ask O
for O
one O
of O
the O
menus O
that O
they O
have O
prepared O
and O
we O
are O
not O
wrong. O

Besides O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy O
and O
we O
spent O
the O
hours O
flying... O
we O
almost O
tied O
up O
with O
dinner O
as O
well O
as O
we O
felt O
there. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
those O
who O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
celebrate O
a O
meal O
among O
friends O
or O
work O
and O
also O
couples O
as O
it O
is O
a O
quiet O
and O
pleasant O
place B-TARGET
with O
simple O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
with O
great O
quality. O

We O
loved O
it; O
very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
nice, O
helpful,... O
if O
you O
can O
eat O
at O
the O
window O
table O
overlooking O
the O
square, O
it O
is O
ideal. O

The O
place B-TARGET
very O
quiet, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

When O
I O
return O
to O
Barcelona O
I O
will O
repeat. O

Very O
cozy, O
like O
you're O
home. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
pleasant O
service. B-TARGET

Something O
expensive, O
but O
the O
menu B-TARGET
has O
quite O
a O
variety O
and O
the O
quality O
is O
good. O

We O
will O
repeat!!! O

We've O
been O
having O
dinner O
Wednesday O
night O
a O
group O
with O
4 O
friends O
and O
we've O
all O
loved O
it. O

Very O
cozy, O
exquisite O
and O
excellent O
treatment. B-TARGET

Besides, O
we O
haven't O
been O
to O
this O
area O
of O
Barcelona O
in O
the O
Born O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
and O
it's O
been O
amazing O
now. O

Fantastic O
choice. O

Nice O
place B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

We O
had O
a O
magnificent O
experience, O
the O
unbeatable O
attention, B-TARGET
the O
recommendations O
of O
the O
manager B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
acertadisimas, O
a O
delicious O
wine. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
that O
whoever O
wants O
a O
good O
meal B-TARGET
be O
put O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
maitre. O

All O
right. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
we've O
had O
a O
really O
good O
dinner. O

Thank O
you. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
thanks O
to O
super O
friendly O
and O
professional O
waiters. B-TARGET

Fantastic. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
very O
cozy, O
very O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much. O

Nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
good O
value O
for O
money. O

After O
dinner O
we O
continue O
with O
the O
good O
combination. B-TARGET

Total O
4 O
hours O
very O
well O
used. O

Excellent O
treatment, B-TARGET
interesting O
decoration, B-TARGET
good O
gender O
(food B-TARGET
quality). O

Insufficient O
quantity, O
dogs O
are O
not O
allowed O
as O
in O
most O
of O
the O
restaurants O
in O
other O
countries. O

In O
a O
few O
months O
they O
have O
gone O
from O
dishes O
with O
abundant O
and O
excellent O
food O
to O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
just O
rations O
at O
the O
same O
price. O

Wines B-TARGET
have O
raised O
prices O
by O
around O
30%. O

What O
a O
pity, O
it's O
gone O
from O
a O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
to O
one O
more O
of O
the O
lot. O

They've O
also O
replaced O
the O
courtesy O
shot O
of O
what O
you O
wanted O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
cava. O

That O
said, O
someone O
thought O
that O
by O
subtracting O
food B-TARGET
and O
drink B-TARGET
and O
raising O
wine B-TARGET
prices O
no O
one O
would O
notice, O
but O
the O
clientele O
is O
not O
silly. O

Very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
next O
to O
the O
market O
of O
the O
bribe. O

Good O
first O
rations B-TARGET
to O
share O
and O
superb O
center O
of O
grilled B-TARGET
hake. I-TARGET

The O
account O
40 O
euros O
with O
a O
bottle O
rioja O
reservation, O
highly O
recommended. O

A O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
quality-price O
ratio O
very O
good, O
local B-TARGET
with O
carefully O
decorated, O
low O
but O
sufficient O
light B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
well O
selected O
musical B-TARGET
thread. I-TARGET

Ideal O
for O
a O
dinner O
as O
a O
couple. O

The O
impressive O
beef B-TARGET
tenderloin, I-TARGET
meat B-TARGET
of O
very O
good O
quality O
and O
just O
to O
the O
point O
we O
ask O
for O
it. O

And O
the O
excellent O
deal. B-TARGET

For O
putting O
a O
stick O
I O
would O
say O
that O
if O
you O
are O
not O
a O
lover O
of O
Rioja B-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
you O
do O
not O
have O
much O
more O
to O
choose O
from, O
yet O
the O
Riojas O
selection O
is O
good. O

We'll O
repeat. O

Yesterday O
we O
took O
a O
pleasant O
surprise. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
had O
a O
very O
intimate O
and O
welcoming O
decoration. O

The O
staff's O
attention B-TARGET
has O
been O
quite O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
phenomenal. O

We'll O
repeat O
for O
sure. O

Recommended O
location. B-TARGET

Well-crafted O
food. B-TARGET

I O
had O
a O
rape B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
hot O
wine O
sauce O
and O
my O
friends O
who O
took O
meat B-TARGET
were O
delighted. O

Let's O
make O
dinner O
up O
to O
3 O
p.m. O
having O
drinks. O

Nice O
evening, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Greetings O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
impressive. O

We O
found O
the O
food B-TARGET
to O
be O
unoriginal, O
and O
it O
has O
too O
much O
potato O
on O
every O
plate. O

One O
of O
the O
dishes O
was O
forgotten O
to O
put O
the O
garnish O
that O
I O
put O
in O
the O
letter. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
but O
very O
fast, O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
were O
very O
close O
together O
and O
every O
time O
the O
waiter O
passed O
we O
were O
beaten O
in O
the O
chair. O

I O
wouldn't O
go O
to O
dinner O
again, O
but O
I O
recommend O
it O
for O
drinks. O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day O
and O
although O
the O
first O
dish O
(riggatoni B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
la I-TARGET
bolognesa I-TARGET
) O
seemed O
a O
little O
short O
(very O
good, O
but O
little O
quantity), O
the O
second O
dish O
supplied O
it O
with O
good O
meat O
dish O
and O
along O
with O
dessert, O
we O
got O
well O
satiated O
from O
the O
restaurant. O

Both O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
and O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
was O
uncompromising, O
so O
we O
went O
out O
with O
a O
magnificent O
feeling. O

I O
totally O
recommend O
it. O

Last O
Saturday O
we O
tried O
to O
celebrate O
Christmas O
dinner O
with O
our O
team. O

The O
experience O
has O
been O
terrible. O

I'll O
explain O
it O
to O
you O
so O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
read O
everything O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
to. O

I O
wouldn't O
recommend O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
or O
an O
enemy. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
agreed O
and O
paid O
in O
part O
in O
advance O
has O
not O
corresponded O
with O
what O
they O
have O
served O
(“it O
was O
a O
mistake,” O
they O
say O
when O
claiming). O

The O
food B-TARGET
they O
have O
served O
has O
been O
scarce O
in O
quantity, O
served O
without O
style O
or O
affection O
and O
we O
have O
had O
to O
endure O
serving O
pieces O
of O
meat B-TARGET
completely O
frozen, O
without O
finishing O
cooking. O

The O
desserts, B-TARGET
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
miniature O
contest. O

They O
say O
they O
were O
good, O
I O
didn't O
try O
them O
because O
there O
were O
fewer O
desserts B-TARGET
than O
people... O

The O
drink B-TARGET
has O
left O
to O
be O
desired O
in O
every O
way, O
it O
has O
been O
little O
and O
it O
has O
not O
included O
even O
beers, O
with O
which O
we O
have O
had O
to O
pay O
an O
extra O
(not O
small, O
because O
cheap O
is O
not) O
to O
be O
able O
to O
finish O
the O
menu O
with O
liquid O
with O
which O
to O
bring O
down O
a O
“rissoto” O
that O
would O
have O
made O
the O
delights O
of O
the O
presenter O
of O
Bricomania, O
in O
the O
chapter O
in O
which O
it O
explains O
how O
to O
overflow O
old O
walls. O

And O
the O
best O
(with O
all O
the O
irony O
that O
I O
am O
able O
without O
fail O
or O
insult) O
service. B-TARGET

They O
have O
tried O
to O
charge O
us O
more O
menus O
than O
those O
consumed, O
they O
have O
not O
proposed O
any O
compensation O
to O
correct O
the O
long O
list O
of O
errors O
they O
have O
recognized O
and O
now O
we O
do O
not O
even O
get O
them O
to O
send O
us O
the O
invoice O
with O
the O
total O
of O
the O
“party”. O

A O
whole O
list O
of O
misdeeds O
that O
have O
made O
our O
Christmas O
dinner O
become O
a O
Nightmare O
chapter O
in O
the O
Kitchen. O

If O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
embitter O
without O
need, O
try O
any O
other O
restaurant O
in O
the O
area. O

No O
matter O
how O
bad O
it O
is, O
it'll O
be O
better O
than O
this O
one. O

Sincere O
and O
cordial O
greetings. O

[...] O
street O
floor O
and O
two O
restaurants O
on O
the O
top O
floor, O
accessed O
by O
stairs. O

One O
restaurant O
is O
the O
Colette O
and O
another O
is O
the O
Q-Art. O

Al O
Colette O
is O
identified O
by O
its O
creators O
as O
“high O
cuisine... O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
clarification O
Pedro, O
if O
you O
use O
only O
this O
trend O
in O
plate O
presentation O
I O
do O
not O
care, O
if O
against O
using O
genetically O
altered O
products O
you O
would O
already O
thank O
me O
so O
much, O
it O
seems O
that O
is O
not O
the O
case. O

So O
you O
tell O
me O
it's O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
as O
well O
as O
good O
cuisine. O

I O
came O
out O
of O
my O
visit O
to O
q-art O
very O
hot, O
but O
your O
review O
re-emphasizes O
the O
possibility O
of O
going O
over O
to O
the O
Colette. O

Say O
hello. O

the O
other O
day O
it O
dines O
in O
colette O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
was O
already O
missing O
a O
retaurant B-TARGET
like O
this O
in O
zaragoza. O

the O
impressive O
comanda, B-TARGET
the O
same O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
attention O
with O
so O
much O
appetizer O
that O
it O
is O
neither O
normal O
of O
good, O
is O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
to O
all O
friends O

I O
love O
that O
place, B-TARGET
which O
in O
general O
does O
not O
disappoint, O
but O
on O
Saturday O
it O
did: O
they O
gave O
me O
table O
for O
3 O
for O
then O
4 O
hours O
later, O
cancel O
it O
and O
bounce O
off O
to O
RISKOMAR, O
where O
we O
ate O
fatal O
(I O
have O
already O
left O
an O
opinion). O

Unseriously O
confirm O
availability O
and O
then O
cancel O
it O
and O
refer O
you O
to O
another O
member O
of O
the O
Group. O

Disappointment, O
as O
in O
her O
day O
it O
was O
that O
the O
waitress O
didn't O
know O
the O
vodka O
MOSKOSCAYA. O

in O
my O
opinion O
is O
an O
impressive O
restaurant, B-TARGET
both O
in O
decoration, B-TARGET
comfort B-TARGET
and O
as O
not O
in O
service B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

This O
last O
one O
is O
the O
best O
of O
all O
in O
staging O
as O
well O
as O
in O
quality O
and O
quantity, O
here O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
tip O
of O
going O
to O
eat O
a O
snack O
because O
you O
stay O
hungry. O

To O
recommend, O
my O
score O
is O
ten. O

The O
first O
impression O
of O
entering O
is O
very O
positive. O

Good O
decoration B-TARGET
and O
staging. B-TARGET

Good O
food, B-TARGET
but O
not O
surprising. O

The O
service B-TARGET
isn't O
up O
to O
it. O

The O
only O
thing O
really O
high O
is O
the O
price. O

My O
note O
would O
be O
seven. O

They O
need O
to O
get O
better O
if O
they O
want O
to O
keep O
charging O
that. O

That O
in O
allusion O
to O
the O
comments O
of O
someone O
who O
pretends O
to O
be O
my O
person O
using O
my O
name O
and O
making O
criticisms O
towards O
this O
restaurant. O

I O
make O
it O
known O
that O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
your O
opinions. O

Colette O
Restaurant. O

DisappointingOn O
the O
occasion O
of O
a O
trip O
to O
Zaragoza O
we O
have O
dinner, O
advised O
by O
the O
hotel, O
at O
the O
Colette O
restaurant. O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
of O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
is O
pretentious O
and O
far O
from O
being O
the O
innovative O
and O
quality O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
they O
advertise. O

The O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
very O
little O
adjusted. O

Surprise O
that O
they O
also O
charge O
you O
the O
sweets B-TARGET
they O
serve O
accompanying O
the O
coffee O
and O
that O
we O
had O
not O
requestedThey O
really O
have O
a O
lot O
to O
learn. O

It O
is O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
not O
to O
remember O
and O
not O
to O
advise O

The O
setting B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
would O
be O
the O
only O
thing O
to O
highlight. O

As O
for O
food, B-TARGET
fine O
but O
nothing O
exclusive O
or O
surprising. O

In O
Zaragoza O
there O
are O
many O
restaurants O
with O
the O
same O
quality O
and O
even O
better. O

What O
is O
really O
regrettable O
is O
the O
service B-TARGET
they O
offer: O

- O
took O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
us O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine, O
after O
having O
ordered O
it O
from O
three O
waitresses. B-TARGET

- O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
bread O
is O
spent, O
they O
do O
not O
take O
out O
any O
more, O
no O
matter O
how O
much O
you O
ask O
and O
insist.-The O
waitresses B-TARGET
offered O
us O
a O
regrettable O
treatment, O
they O
even O
came O
to O
yell O
at O
us O
and O
demand O
silence O
(we O
were O
fifteen O
people, O
so O
it O
is O
normal O
a O
certain O
murmur).. O

Honestly, O
it's O
been O
the O
worst O
service B-TARGET
I've O
ever O
been O
offered, O
and O
that, O
in O
a O
restaurant O
like O
this, O
is O
unforgivable. O

They O
looked O
like O
tavern O
waitresses O
in O
a O
three-fork O
restaurant. O

I'M O
NOT O
RECOGNIZING O
IT. O

We O
have O
been O
three O
times O
in O
the O
spa, O
and O
we O
look O
great, O
comfortable O
rooms, O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
very O
beneficial O
waters O
for O
people O
with O
skin O
or O
respiratory O
problems, O
we O
will O
return. O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
kindness O
of O
all O
the O
workers. B-TARGET

<->The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
slow, O
especially O
for O
groups O
that O
operate O
on O
a O
rather O
strict O
schedule. O

<->The O
staff B-TARGET
however O
very O
friendly. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good, O
the O
rices B-TARGET
excellent O
in O
general. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
impressive O
and O
with O
very O
good O
prices. O

Exquisite O
and O
abundant O
food. B-TARGET

The O
truth O
is O
a O
good O
option O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona O
to O
enjoy O
a O
good O
dinner. O

We O
were O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
and O
we O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
fun, O
backeoms. O

I O
didn't O
know O
you O
and O
on O
Saturday O
day O
5.09 O
I O
was O
having O
dinner O
with O
the O
Singles O
Bcn O
group O
and O
it O
was O
a O
real O
disaster, O
it O
wasn't O
fulfilled O
with O
what O
was O
displayed O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
the O
"horrendo" O
service B-TARGET
I O
would O
almost O
say O
over O
the O
bad O
manner, O
it O
was O
a O
pity, O
the O
whole O
group O
of O
the O
table O
was O
not O
willing O
to O
return. O

On O
Sunday O
we O
were O
eating O
with O
the O
family O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
children I-TARGET
is O
appreciated O
because O
it O
is O
complete O
and O
at O
a O
good O
price, O
La O
carte B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
rice O
very O
well O
as O
desserts. B-TARGET

The O
waiter's B-TARGET
attention O
was O
impeccable O
at O
all O
times. O

Excellent O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona, O
A O
paella B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
that O
we O
will O
remember O
as O
well O
as O
good O
wines B-TARGET
very O
well. O

Quiet O
nice O
and O
children O
do O
not O
bother O
with O
a O
successful O
children's O
menu B-TARGET
a O
good O
choice O
for O
the O
whole O
family. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
group O
having O
dinner O
last O
Saturday O
and O
everything O
was O
perfect, O
food, B-TARGET
service, B-TARGET
atmosphere B-TARGET
we O
will O
return. O

The O
quality O

of O
the O
best. O

the O
flesh B-TARGET
is O
unscentable O

Dismissed O
waiters: B-TARGET
we O
had O
to O
share O
a O
rice O
because O
being O
4 O
pointed O
3, O
they O
brought O
account O
of O
another O
table, O
discussions O
between O
waiters... O

Correctite O
food. B-TARGET

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
last O
Friday O
and O
we O
were O
greeted O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
pink O
cava, O
the O
letter B-TARGET
is O
most O
varied O
and O
we O
really O
liked O
a O
salt B-TARGET
sea I-TARGET
bass I-TARGET
that O
we O
recommended, O
the O
very O
nice O
waiters. B-TARGET

The O
chocolate B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
delicious O
desserts. O

I O
booked O
for O
1.01.07, O
and O
when O
I O
got O
there, O
they O
didn't O
have O
it O
on. O

Neither O
mine O
nor O
a O
few O
men. O

that O
they O
arrived O
earlier. O

We O
weren't O
told O
it O
was O
a O
closed O
menu O
that O
day O
either. O

We O
left O
without O
eating. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
several O
times O
for O
several O
reasons: O
good O
value O
for O
money, O
fast O
and O
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
situation B-TARGET
(near O
Pl.Urquinaona) O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
exquisite. O

Totally O
recommended O
for O
any O
event: O
family, O
friends O
and O
couple O

Dinner B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
make O
a O
proposal O
for O
improvement: O
The O
waiters B-TARGET
who O
attended O
us O
were O
too O
stressed O
and O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
attend, O
so O
maybe O
if O
they O
put O
another O
waiter O
or O
the O
logistic B-TARGET
kitchen-room I-TARGET
system I-TARGET
was O
better O
designed, O
the O
customers O
would O
be O
attended O
more O
promptly. O

<->Heat O
on O
the O
premises B-TARGET

Quality-price O
ratio O

Very O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food B-TARGET

I O
really O
liked O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

So O
you O
won't O
be O
hungry. O

With O
the O
50% O
discount O
it O
comes O
out O
very O
good O
price. O

Very O
correct. O

I O
think O
the O
title O
indicates O
everything. O

Reservation O
of O
2 O
people O
at O
14.30. O

Letter O
+ O
cup O
cava. O

We O
arrived O
on O
time. O

Considerable O
standing O
waiting B-TARGET
(long O
tail). O

I'm O
trying O
to O
find O
a O
free O
table O
up O
and O
down. O

In O
the O
end O
they O
find O
one O
by O
chance O
in O
an O
uncomfortable O
corner. B-TARGET

On O
top O
of O
my O
head O
I O
had O
the O
TV O
screen O
with O
the O
sound B-TARGET
to O
my O
left O
ear. O

Did O
the O
table O
have O
to O
be O
reserved? O

We O
chose O
menu O
dishes. O

I O
order O
Raimat O
Chardonay O
wine. O

The O
waiter O
asks O
me O
if O
white O
or O
red O
(?). O

I'm O
telling O
you, O
chardonay O
is O
a O
white O
grape O
strain. O

My O
first O
dish O
(starred B-TARGET
eggs) I-TARGET
was O
simply O
fries O
and O
over O
a O
couple O
of O
fried O
eggs O
(without O
any O
look). O

We're O
at O
home O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
way. O

My O
wife O
ordered O
prawn O
salad. O

Three O
or O
four O
fried O
prawns O
on O
top O
of O
arucula. O

As O
a O
second, O
we O
both O
ask O
for O
salt O
sea O
bass. O

They O
don't. O

They O
offer O
hake O
with O
sauce. O

A O
deep O
dish O
filled O
with O
liquid O
with O
two O
pieces O
of O
fish O
(my O
lady O
claimed O
that O
this O
was O
not O
hake B-TARGET
and O
whatever O
it O
was O
was O
was O
super O
frozen). O

No O
value O
for O
money. O

We O
asked O
about O
the O
glass O
of O
cava O
that O
was O
offered O
in O
the O
reserve. O

The O
waiter, O
no O
idea. O

Tell O
the O
maitre O
(I O
believe) O
and O
he O
tells O
us O
that O
"good", O
"if O
you O
want O
cava" O
you O
offer O
them O
two O
cups O
in O
desserts O
(he O
tells O
the O
waiter). O

My O
dessert O
could O
be O
eaten, O
but O
my O
wife O
ordered O
pineapple O
with O
coconut O
ice O
cream. O

The O
pineapple B-TARGET
had O
an O
intense O
taste O
of O
garlic. O

I O
guess O
they O
cut O
the O
pineapple O
with O
the O
same O
knife O
they O
cut O
the O
garlic O
with. O

After O
all O
this, O
is O
it O
or O
is O
it O
not O
a O
joke? O

Of O
course O
I'm O
already O
calling O
to O
warn O
all O
my O
relationships. O

I O
don't O
go O
back O
there O
anymore. O

And O
know O
that O
there O
are O
other O
details O
I O
don't O
comment O
on O
so O
as O
not O
to O
lengthen O
me O
any O
longer. O

I O
think O
you O
should O
consider O
keeping O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
your O
website. O

Some O
points, O
for O
me, O
to O
be O
corrected: O

- O
I O
booked O
the O
New O
Year's O
gala O
dinner O
online, O
but O
the O
restaurant O
did O
not O
find O
my O
reservation O
and O
the O
price O
was O
10 O
E. O
major O
(small O
thing: O
I O
ate O
the O
same); O

- O
It O
could O
be O
better O
organized O
in O
the O
change O
of O
the O
cutlery, B-TARGET
the O
same O
used O
by O
two O
dishes O
(entrance O
and O
main). O

For O
handling O
and O
speed O
of O
service B-TARGET
: O
commendable. O

We O
chose O
menu O
B O
(25 O
euros O
per O
head). O

An O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
to O
bring O
us O
the O
first O
ones O
(it O
happened O
the O
first O
hour O
only O
with O
the O
ham O
and O
bread O
with O
tomato). O

We O
asked O
for O
a O
reservation O
in O
writing O
and O
on O
the O
phone O
and O
they O
did O
not O
give O
it O
to O
us O
despite O
having O
said O
that O
ok. O

We O
said O
the O
number O
of O
diners O
in O
writing O
and O
twice O
on O
the O
phone, O
and O
they O
didn't O
put O
the O
necessary O
chairs O
either. O

A O
real O
disappointment. O

Rice, B-TARGET
in O
very O
generous O
ration O
and O
with O
an O
abundance O
of O
supplements, O
such O
as O
prawns, O
mussels, O
clams O
and O
prawns. O

We O
couldn't O
finish O
it! O

To O
be O
improved: O
the O
location B-TARGET
where O
the O
portions O
of O
rice O
or O
fish O
are O
impaled. O

All O
very O
correct, O
very O
close O
and O
precise O
treatment. B-TARGET

A O
highly O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Congratulations. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
cozy, O
although O
the O
quality-price O
ratio O
is O
not O

quite O
expensive O
for O
what O
they O
served O
that O
is O
not O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
they O
proposed O
in O
the O
offer, O
since O
the O
rice O
was O
going O
to O
be O
of O
lobster O
and O
they O
made O
it O
of O
Norway O
lobsters...the O
dessert B-TARGET
very O
scarce, O
only O
two O
truffles O
and O
without O
option O
in O
return. O

The O
drink B-TARGET
was O
also O
not O
included O
and O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
high O

In O
the O
end O
he O
came O
out O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
as O
eating O
a O
la O
carte O
and O
unable O
to O
choose. O

The O
discount O
is O
50%. O

We O
pay O
18€/person O

4 O

We O
are O

disappointed O
that O
of O
the O
extensive O

they O
only O
had O
the O
fourth O

Pay B-TARGET
attention O
to O
their O

perhaps O
too O

we O
had O
not O
yet O
decided O
the O

As O
for O

not O
ask O
the O

Otherwise O
the O

The O

but O
the O
menu B-TARGET
that O
day, O
at O
least O
what O
I O
tried, O
very O
fair, O
almost O
suspended. O

In O
the O
kitchen O
they O
should O
be O
hungover O
because O
I O
asked O
for O
noodles B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
verduritas I-TARGET
and O
I'm O
still O
looking O
for O
them, O
it O
was O

We O
had O

very O

next O

we O
went O

a O
lid O
with O
a O
wine, O
everything O
turned O
out O
very O
niceThe O
only O
thing O
that O
would O
put, O
is O
that O
we O
did O
not O
find O
the O
phone B-TARGET
on O
any O
website, O
which O
we O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
without O
knowing O
if O
we O
would O
have O
room. O

We O
were O
delighted. O

We O
were O
last O
night, O
February O
22, O
2015. O

My O
husband O
asked O
for O
a O
reservation O
only O
for O
us, O
and O
we O
were O
left O
with O
nothing. O

We O
ordered O
a O

menu I-TARGET
and O
all O
great. O

Five O
Dishes B-TARGET
with O

didn't O
take O
long O

us, O
always O
attentive O
so O
that O
we O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait. O

Super O
recommended. O

Just O
a O
little O
detail, O
it O
lacked O
ambient B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
to O
be O
perfect. O

I O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
there O
are O
those O
who O
make O
analogies O
with O
the O
Diverxo O
restaurant O
in O
Madrid, O
who O
have O
qualified O
it O
as O
the O
59 O
best O
restaurant O
in O
the O
world... O
saving O
the O
distance O
if O
the O
Gamberro O
was O
in O

I O
think O
we O
would O
see O
it O
with O
other O

my O
congratulations, O
I O
will O
return. O

I O
don't O
advise O
it O

of O
restaurants O
in O
Zaragoza O
successfully O
but O
Gamberro O
let O
us O
down O
a O
lot. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
scarce O
even O
for O
a O
tasting O
menu. O

But O
still, O
if O
the O
food O
had O
triumphed, O
we O
would O
have O
given O
it O
the O
same. O

Something O
insipid, O
missing O
a O
touch... O
in O
short, O
we O
didn't O
like O
it, O
we O
won't O
come O
back, O
and O
I O
don't O
recommend O
it. O

We O
went O
to O
do O
a O
family O
celebration O
to O
HOSTERIA O
BOTIN O
DEL O
CORREGIDOR O
in O
c/ O
Josefa O
Amar O
and O
Borbom, O
it O
was O
my O
daughter's O
confirmation, O
we O
were O
15 O
people O
and O
we O
really O
went O
out O
very O
satisfied, O
the O
relationship O
quality O
price O
was O
very O
favorable, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
and O
cordial O
and O
the O
dining B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
above O
very O
pleasant. O

I O
really O
recommend O
it O
from O
here O

ISABEL O
AND O
MANOLO O

I O
was O
at O
the O
restaurant O
this O
weekend O
(March O
2009). O

I've O
been O
there O
twice O
before. O

This O
has O
been O
the O
third O
and O
the O
last. O

It's O
gotten O
considerably O
worse. O

They O
have O
removed O
the O
Mexican O
food O
menu, O
which O
was O
what O
was O
most O
worthwhile, O
and O
there O
is O
only O
Italian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
of O
very O
basic O
quality. O

I O
ate O
a O
lasagna B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
poorly O
cooked... O
I O
think O
the O
ones O
that O
sell O
frozen O
in O
the O
super O
are O
better. O

To O
top O
it O
off, O
we O
were O
encouraged O
to O
stay O
with O
music B-TARGET
to O
a O
not O
very O
normal O
volume O
of O
Latin O
American O
music...an O
inconsistency O
in O
a O
restaurant O
called O
Monasterio O
and O
it O
gives O
Italian O
food. O

That's O
what O
I O
said, O
so O
I O
wouldn't O
come O
back. O

Now O
there's O
a O
snack O
shop. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
closing O
is O
something O
that O
was O
coming. O

I O
had O
been O
at O
various O
group O
dinners O
in O
2004 O
and O
2005 O
and O
nothing O
comparable O
to O
what O
I O
found O
in O
January O
2009: O
a O
lousy O
care, B-TARGET
a O
fair O
meal B-TARGET
and O
an O
expensive O
price O
for O
what O
I O
received. O

And O
having O
you O
thrown O
out O
at O
12 O
p.m. O
because O
they O
had O
to O
have O
dinner O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
eve O
of O
Reyes O
has O
his O
grace. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
hotel O
business, O
you O
have O
to O
act O
accordingly. O

Had O
he O
changed O
owners O
or O
something? O

An O
excectional O
restaurant, B-TARGET
with O
an O
impressive O
quality O
of O
products, B-TARGET
fresh B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
brought O
from O
San O
SEBASTIAN, O
and O
meat, B-TARGET
in O
few O
restaurants O
you O
eat O
it O
as O
in O
the O
cider O
shop. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
customer O
of O
La O
Kupela O
for O
years O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
they O
have O
always O
maintained O
the O
same O
line O
with O
the O
quality O
of O
their O
products. O

Here O
I O
am O
not O
fooled O
and O
all O
their O
products B-TARGET
are O
first O
class.The O
fish B-TARGET
are O
sensational, O
fresh O
and O
cooked O
without O
sauces O
that O
sometimes O
only O
pretend O
to O
mask O
a O
bad O
product. O

And O
of O
the O
meat, B-TARGET
they O
can O
boast O
of O
being O
the O
best O
meat O
in O
Zaragoza, O
and O
I O
would O
dare O
say, O
of O
the O
best O
in O
Spain. O

If O
people O
want O
to O
fill O
their O
guts O
at O
a O
cheap O
price, O
of O
course O
La O
Kupela O
is O
not O
for O
them. O

Please, O
keep O
doing O
it O
as O
usual, O
Zaragoza O
deserves O
top-notch O
restaurant, O
and O
believe O
me, O
there O
are O
very O
few. O

Hello O
Every O
time O
we've O
gone O
has O
been O
just O
as O
good: O
quality O

Regarding O
the O
price O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
author O
of O
this O
already O
Web. O

Alberto O
Frisch O

Good O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
perhaps O
the O
price O
is O
sometimes O
a O
little O
high O
but O
it O
is O
worth O
trying O
your O
meats. B-TARGET

Too O
expensive O
for O
the O
times. O

If O
they O
don't O
catch O
up, O
they'll O
lose O
customers. O

Your O
attention B-TARGET
very O
good, O
excellent O
food, B-TARGET
a O
very O
beautiful O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
fine, O
but O
the O
price O
is O
a O

A O
great O

impeccable O
service, B-TARGET
fabulous O
food, B-TARGET
a O

friends O
we O
did O
a O
pica B-TARGET
de O

to O
try O
typical O
Catalan O

they O
were O
delighted. O

The O
right O
price O
and O
suitable O
for O
food. B-TARGET

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
the O

Good O

for O

Very O
kind O

abnormally O
slow O
service. B-TARGET

Recommended. O

Highly O
recommended O

One O
of O
the O
best O
Argentinians O
in O

Fantastic, O
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
but O
the O

is O
that O
impressive O
service, B-TARGET
so O
food O
tastes O
even O
better!! O

Good O

I'll O

jmarcoj, O
what O
do O
you O
want O
with O
“so O
the O
Iberian O
dam O
does O
not O
appear”? O

In O
the O
explanations O
given O
in O
the O
Herald O
of O
Aragon O
on O
the O
merits O
of O
Michelin O
stars, O
reference O
was O
made O
to O
customer O
service O
and O
quality O
in O
service O
and O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
dishes O
constant O
over O
time. O

I O
was O
in O
March O
and O
in O
principle O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
the O
conversations O
of O
the O
tables O
were O
heard O
and O
bothered O
but O
what O
I O
didn't O
think O
was O
good O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
quality O
in O
the O
customer O
service, B-TARGET
I O
explain: O
We O
asked O
for O
the O
tasting O
menu O
and O
when O
asking O
us, O
a O
detail, O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
record O
some O
food O
that O
we O
didn't O
like, O
we O
told O
him O
that O
in O
the O
dishes O
that O
were O
made O
at O
the O
time O
they O
didn't O
put O
salt.In O
one O
of O
the O
dishes O
they O
took O
fresh O
foie O
to O
the O
plate O
full O
of O
fat O
salt O
and O
when O
we O
made O
the O
observation O
they O
apologized O
but O
they O
didn't O
offer O
to O
redo O
it O
without O
salt, O
it O
doesn't O
seem O
right O
first O
to O
show O
the O
little O
attention B-TARGET
that O
is O
given O
to O
the O
requests O
of O
the O
customers O
that O
are O
distributed O
in O
5 O
tables O
and O
second O
for O
the O
cutrez O
of O
not O
rectifying O
the O
error. O

They O
offered O
us O
three O
first, O
an O
exquisite O
risotto B-TARGET
and O
two O
other O
dishes O
that O
would O
be O
very O
rich O
if O
not O
because O
they O
lined O
them O
with O
orange B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
eggs I-TARGET
that O
with O
their O
strong O
flavor O
and O
being O
preserved O
in O
salt O
masked O
the O
original O
flavor O
of O
the O
dishes.I O
don't O
know O
if O
it O
was O
chance O
to O
add O
the O
eggs O
to O
the O
two O
dishes, O
but O
if O
they O
didn't O
do O
it O
to O
finish O
the O
can, O
repeat O
twice O
and O
above O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
something O
very O
salty O
when O
we O
had O
mentioned O
the O
question O
of O
the O
salt O
and O
that O
the O
dishes O
could O
have O
been O
served O
without O
the O
eggs. O

The O
rest O
is O
fine, O
but O
he O
let O
us O
down O
on O
a O
special O
day. O

Restaurante O
Bal O
d’Onsera O
de O
Zaragoza, O
maintains O
its O
Michelin O
star O
during O
2010.[...] O

I O
honestly O
see O
it O
right O
with O
the O
explanations, O
but O
for O
my O
taste O
it O
is O
a O
barbarity O
to O
pay O
170 O
euros O
per O
couple O
for O
what O
presented O
telling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
take O
coffees, O
and O
I O
respect O
it O
since O
it O
has O
a O
Michelin O
star, O
but O
it O
does O
not O
give O
right O
to O
charge O
per O
star, O
place O
or O
person O
with O
which O
you O
have O
learned, O
the O
kitchen O
is O
an O
art, O
a O
taste O
and O
a O
way O
to O
present O
a O
work, O
so O
it O
is O
difficult O
for O
many O
people O
to O
know O
it. O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
restaurants O
are O
to O
taste O
what O
you O
eat, O
drink, O
talk, O
and O
have O
a O
small O
table.Restaurants O
have O
to O
have O
that O
incentive, O
because O
it's O
like O
going O
to O
the O
movies O
and O
you O
can't O
laugh, O
cry, O
or O
fall O
asleep O
in O
the O
worst O
case O
scenario. O

Nice O
to O
meet O
you O
all, O
but O
it'll O
be O
hard O
for O
you O
to O
see O
me O
in O
places O
like O
this, O
I O
wish O
you O
all O
the O
best. O

Thanks O
for O
your O
chronicle, O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
help O
to O
decide O
where O
NOT O
to O
go O
to O
celebrate O
a O
special O
dinner, O
I O
will O
leave O
my O
place O
for O
experienced O
food O
critics. O

Thank O
you O
for O
being O
so O
independent O
and O
sincere O
in O
your O
chronicles, O
keep O
it O
that O
way. O

I O
see O
that O
I O
have O
been O
right, O
neither O
are O
you O
Aragonese, O
nor O
have O
you O
understood O
the O
formula. O

What O
can O
be O
a O
tiring O
mental O
exercise O
for O
you O
doesn't O
have O
to O
be O
for O
others. O

However, O
I O
am O
looking O
forward O
to O
knowing O
the O
coefficients O
and O
parameters O
evaluated. O

And O
by O
the O
way, O
to O
know O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
return O
without O
touching O
the O
nose. O

Mr. O
Gonzalo O
López O
Madrazo.I O
agree O
with O
your O
appreciations, O
I O
also O
do O
not O
like O
being O
disturbed O
by O
asking O
how O
the O
food O
was, O
asks O
almost O
always O
rhetorical, O
epseranod O
a O
“very O
well”, O
“perfect, O
thank O
you”. O

What O
I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
is O
that O
it O
is O
not O
central, O
for O
me O
it O
is O
in O
the O
best O
area B-TARGET
of O
the O
city, O
between O
the O
PLaza O
del O
Pilar O
and O
the O
Plaza O
de O
España, O
in O
the O
tube, O
authentic O
meolo O
of O
Zaragoza O
full O
of O
centuries O
of O
history. O

<-> O
Absolutely O
nothing. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
service. B-TARGET

It's O
all O
perfect. O

Great! O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
medium O
price. O

Various O
menu: B-TARGET
Eggs B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
foie, I-TARGET
calçots B-TARGET
and O
meat B-TARGET
in O
general. O

For O
saying O
something... O

Desserts B-TARGET
could O
be O
improved O

We O
had O
a O
reservation O
for O
a O
calçotada. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
we O
had O
never O
tried O
it O
and O
we O
didn't O
know O
how O
to O
eat O
them O
and O
one O
of O
the O
waiters O
put O
on O
gloves O
and O
showed O
it O
to O
us. O

They O
were B-TARGET
all I-TARGET
very I-TARGET
kind O
and O
attentive. O

The O
quantity O
and O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good. O

Very O
satisfied O
with O
food B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

First O
course O
we O
ordered O
asparagus B-TARGET
and O
served O
them O
cold O
with O
the O
cold O
sauce. B-TARGET

We O
didn't O
like O
it O
too O
much. O

Then O
we O
asked O
for O
meat B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
good, O
but O
the O
accompaniment B-TARGET
was O
cold O
too. O

I O
got O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
right. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
in O
time. O

totally O
recommended O
to O
take O
a O
calçotada O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona. O

We O
took O
the O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu O
and O
it O
was O
very O
correct O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
repeating O
calçots B-TARGET
and O
the O
drink B-TARGET
included O
without O
limit. O

The O
meat's B-TARGET
good, O
too. O

We O
were O
15 O
and O
it O
was O
very O
good O
to O
be O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona. O

Enjoy O
with O
your O
partner O
a O
very O
modern O
atmosphere B-TARGET
but O
without O
losing O
warmth O
and O
enjoying O
a O
very O
varied O
menu B-TARGET
that O
covers O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
preferences O

We O
made O
a O
reservation O
for O
11 O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
everything O
is O
very O
correct. O

The O
attention B-TARGET
of O
the O
excellent O
boss, O
punctual O
in O
the O
reservation, O
and O
a O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
the O
calçotada O
menu. O

Perhaps O
the O
only O
catch O
(for O
my O
taste) O
is O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
barbecue I-TARGET
was O
not O
very O
big O
(although O
it O
is O
true O
that O
you O
were O
allowed O
to O
repeat O
calçots B-TARGET
and O
that O
almost O
everyone O
was O
already O
full). O

Rich O
calçots B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
meat B-TARGET
as O
well. O

If O
you O
organize O
something O
in O
a O
group O
and O
want O
to O
look O
good O
with O
the O
diners O
I O
recommend O
it O
without O
a O
doubt. O

We O
ordered O
the O
menu O
decalada B-TARGET
and O
everything O
was O
very O
good...the O
restaurant B-TARGET
very O
nice...the O
only O
things O
are O
the O
tables B-TARGET
a O
little O
small O
and O
too O
close O
for O
all O
well. O

recommended. O

Due O
to O
a O
family O
problem O
I O
had O
to O
cancel O
the O
reservation, O
communicating O
the O
subject O
to O
the O
restaurant O
in O
due O
course. O

The O
restaurant, B-TARGET
used O
on O
previous O
occasions, O
is O
very O
good: O
good O
value O
for O
money, O
impeccable O
attention B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
and O
perfect O
cleaning O
of O
kitchen-dining-services. O

Highly O
recommended. O

Very O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
very O
well O
(when O
we O
made O
the O
reservation O
we O
recorded O
that O
it O
was O
an O
anniversary, O
and O
they O
placed O
us O
in O
a O
romantic O
corner O
and O
gave O
us O
2 O
glasses O
of O
cava). O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
simple, O
well O
prepared O
and O
well O
presented. O

The O
value O
for O
money O
ratio O
is O
good. O

It's O
a O
place O
I O
put O
on O
my O
schedule. O

Very O
rich O
food B-TARGET
and O
variety O
on O
the O
menu. B-TARGET

Recommended. O

The O
menu O
of O
calçotada B-TARGET
seemed O
to O
us O
of O
the O
most O
complete O
and O
the O
relationship O
quality O
price O
very O
high O
besides O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice. O

Good O

Some O
fish B-TARGET
menu O
is O
missing. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
night O
celebrating O
21 O
years O
of O
cou O
promotion. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
friendly, O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
repeating O
dishes B-TARGET
from O
the O
menu. O

A O
good O
option O
at O
low O
cost. O

Honestly, O
I O
can't O
say O
anything O
better O
than O
to O
make O
sure O
I'm O
coming O
back. O

Excellent O
value O
for O
money. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
well O
cooked. O

We O
went O
to O
eat O
3 O
people, O
very O
complete O
this O
menu, B-TARGET
in O
related O
quality O
price O
very O
good. O

Yesterday O
I O
went O
with O
two O
friends O
to O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
truth O
was O
they O
treated O
us O
super O
well, O
they O
had O
the O
table O
prepared O
for O
us O
even O
though O
we O
were O
late. O

They O
were O
fast, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
varied O
and O
the O
good O
products, B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
totally O
recommended. O

The O
food B-TARGET
very O
well, O
but O
if O
anything O
stands O
out O
above O
all, O
it O
is O
the O
very O
attentive O
treatment O
of O
all O
the O
staff, B-TARGET
whom O
you O
see O
wanting O
that O
everything O
is O
good O
for O
the O
customer. O

Without O
hesitation O
we O
will O
repeat O
it. O

If O
you O
had O
to O
put O
some O
but, O
this O
would O
be O
how O
fair O
we O
were, O
but O
I O
understand O
that O
with O
a O
group O
of O
18 O
and O
on O
a O
day O
of O
kings, O
the O
location O
should O
not O
be O
easy. O

The O
booking O
service O
offered O
by O
Central O
Reservation O
perfect. O

The O
restaurant O
telephoned O
me O
to O
confirm O
the O
reservation O
and O
the O
table O
and O
time O
were O
fully O
adjusted O
to O
the O
required. O

Normal O
dinner, B-TARGET
some O
products O
better O
than O
others. O

Fast, O
comfortable O
and O
effective. O

A O
hit. O

We O
all O
went O
out O
happy O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good. O

We O
changed O
the O
menu O
that O
was O
advertised O
a O
little O
bit. O

Dinner B-TARGET
was O
very O
well O
recommended. O

All O
right O
for O
the O
level O
of O
people O
there O
were. O

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
presentation, O
along O
with O
correct O
attention. B-TARGET

Excellent O
description O
Fernando, O
I O
understood O
that O
La O
Matilde O
was O
much O
more O
expensive, O
well O
to O
know O
that O
for O
that O
price O
you O
can O
dine O
there. O

I O
was O
two O
weeks O
ago, O
I O
returned O
after O
2 O
years O
(then O
marveled O
at O
me) O
but O
now O
in O
2010 O
I O
saw O
him O
a O
little O
left, O
I O
was O
not O
surprised O
at O
all O
and O
the O
impression O
he O
gave O
me O
was O
that O
they O
had O
little O
variety O
to O
choose O
from. O

It O
was O
all O
good, O
but O
I O
don't O
think O
it's O
going O
a O
third O
time. O

As O
far O
as O
price-quality O
is O
concerned O
and O
within O
its O
category, O
from O
my O
point O
of O
view, O
it O
must O
be O
one O
of O
Zaragoza's O
reference O
restaurants. B-TARGET

Their O
experience, O
professionalism, O
service B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
treatment O
bring O
an O
added O
value O
that O
is O
difficult O
to O
match O
at O
the O
moment. O

Your O
address B-TARGET
gets O
quite O
what O
I O
understand O
you're O
trying O
to O
do. O

The O
one O
who O
will O
eat, O
go O
when O
he O
goes, O
already O
knows O
what O
will O
be O
found: O
first O
quality, B-TARGET
unique O
winery, B-TARGET
renewed O
but O
without O
surprises, O
polite O
treatment, O
pleasant O
and O
that O
invites O
you O
to O
come O
back O
before O
you O
have O
gone. O

Even O
if O
it's O
the O
first O
time O
you've O
visited O
them, O
you O
get O
the O
feeling O
of O
getting O
to O
know O
them O
forever. O

In O
short, O
a O
charm. O

(Although O
it O
seems O
like O
an O
exaggerated O
comment, O
it O
is O
not O
and O
I O
clarify, O
I O
am O
not O
a O
family, O

a O
simple O

who O
appreciates O
the O

A O
greeting. O

Pasta O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
American O
cuisine O
with O
a O
regular O
quality. O

If O
the O
dining O
rooms O
aren't O
too O
full O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
isn't O
bad. O

The O
problem O
comes O
when O
they O
are O
filled, O
since O
they O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
staff B-TARGET
to O
be O
able O
to O
attend O
them.This O
restaurant O
is O
located O
next O
to O
the O
football O
field O
of O
Romareda. O

And O
the O
days O
that O
there O
are O
parties O
the O
thing O
is O
still O
worse O
because O
of O
the O
influx O
of O
customers O
and O
the O
clear O
lack O
of O
staff. B-TARGET

One O
of O
these O
days O
my O
experience O
was O
totally O
negative O
since O
apparently O
one O
of O
the O
owners O
or O
manager O
entered O
the O
kitchen O
and O
the O
screams O
could O
be O
heard O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
when O
the O
place O
was O
full. O

In O
general O
it O
is O
not O
recommended O
if O
you O
do O
not O
know O
what O
days O
Zaragoza O
plays O
at O
home O
or O
it O
is O
very O
full. O

Better O
to O
go O
by.It O
is O
an O
area O
in O
which O
there O
is O
no O
shortage O
of O
hotel O
offer O
with O
better O
quality. O

A O
few O
weeks O
ago O
I O
was O
walking O
around O
the O
Romareda O
area O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
son. O

When O
we O
saw O
the O
Retaurant O
Pasta O
City O
and O
decided O
to O
stay O
for O
lunch. O

The O
look O
of O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
poor O
imitation O
of O
typical O
American O
fast O
food O
restaurants. O

And O
since O
it O
was O
mostly O
glazed O
and O
it O
was O
a O
hot O
day, O
chickens O
could O
almost O
be O
roasted O
in O
the O
dining B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
without O
the O
need O
for O
an O
oven. O

Anyway, O
we O
decided O
to O
stay. O

We O
ask O
for O
the O
letter, O
and O
our O
surprise O
is O
that O
they O
bring O
us O
three O
cards, O
including O
dessert O
cards. O

We O
think, O
well O
at O
least O
we'll O
have O
variety. O

Variety, O
yes, O
but O
in O
the O
letter. O

Because O
in O
practice, O
our O
first O
choice O
of O
dishes. O

They O
didn't O
have O
two. O

Including O
something O
as O
elementary O
and O
basic O
as O
an O
entrecot. O

They O
recommended O
a O
few O
ribs O
to O
the O
grill, O
and O
we O
listened O
to O
the O
waiter.First, O
to O
go O
picturing O
a O
variety O
of O
onion O
rings, O
nugets O
and O
some O
mozzarella O
overflows O
with O
several O
pot O
sauces O
like O
those O
you O
can O
find O
in O
any O
supermarket. O

That's O
right, O
served O
in O
a O
few O
small O
bowls. O

And O
then O
a O
children's O
menu O
for O
the O
little O
one, O
composed O
of O
a O
hamburger O
with O
potatoes O
and O
the O
recommended O
ribs, O
along O
with O
two O
soft O
drinks O
and O
a O
beer.At O
this O
point O
in O
my O
opinion, O
I O
think O
it O
goes O
without O
saying O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
the O
typical O
of O
a O
franchise O
of O
this O
type O
but O
in O
bad. O

All O
with O
pot O
sauce B-TARGET
and O
frozen O
products. B-TARGET

Come O
on O
you O
don't O
need O
to O
have O
a O
great O
Chef O
in O
the O
kitchen O
either.The O
bill O
was O
excessive O
for O
the O
type O
of O
food B-TARGET
quality O
and O
quantity. O

We O
paid O
64 O
euros.The O
service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
also O
say O
that O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
we O
were O
four O
and O
the O
guitar.Summarizing. O

My O
experience B-TARGET
is O
negative O
and O
I O
won't O
come O
back O
anymore. O

Any O
other O
place O
with O
special O
menu O
is O
better O
priced O
and O
their O
food O
is O
homemade O
and O
fresher. O

I O
take O
note O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

You'll O
see O
when O
I O
tell O
my O
father O
that O
he's O
gone O
to O
the O
core. O

Greetings O
and O
congratulations O
on O
this O
magnificent O
page, O
my O
friend. O

02-12-2012 O
We O
chose O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
the O
comments, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
disappointment. O

We O
are O
four O
diners O
and O
we O
have O
ordered: O
Ham B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
(we O
are O
told O
it O
is O
5J) O
for O
us O
we O
understand O
that O
some O
was O
lost O
by O
the O
stairs. O
Shrimp B-TARGET
cakes I-TARGET
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Huelva O
or O
Cadiz O
but O
there O
is O
so O
much O
difference O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
value. O

Hortigillas, B-TARGET
fatal O
seemed O
like O
you O
were O
eating O
beach O
sand. O

Puntilitas, B-TARGET
although O
with O
a O
certain O
flavor O
of O
reburned O
oil O
were O
acceptable. O

Señorito's B-TARGET
rice, I-TARGET
a O
real O
disaster, O
past O
punctuated O
and O
the O
cook O
dropped O
the O
pot O
of O
paprika O
from O
the O
smoked O
vera, O
IMPOSSIBLE O
TO O
EAT O
it. O

I O
kiss B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
orrium, I-TARGET
Incomestible O
(soft O
or O
past) O
with O
a O
smell O
of O
vinegar O
impossible O
to O
bear.ALL O
WE O
SAY O
TO O
FULL O
BOCA O
AND O
WITHOUT O
TAPUS, O
WE O
ARE O
HUELVA, O
ALMERIA O
AND O
BADAJOZ, O
EVERYTHING O
WE O
ORDER O
WE O
KNOW O
TO O
PERFECT O
AND O
SERVED O
BECOME O
TO O
REALITY O
AS O
A O
HOUSE O
TO O
A O
CASTAÑA. O

By O
the O
way, O
they O
had O
the O
prudence O
not O
to O
charge O
us O
the O
sea O
bream O
but O
the O
rice. O

And O
finally O
the O
wines B-TARGET
out O
of O
price O
(Pesquera O
breeds O
30€) O
but O
in O
good O
condition O
(without O
posos) O
was O
not O

if O
someone O
gives O

my O
worst O
enemy. O

Greetings O

Hello, O
on O
the O
12th O
of O
October O
pillar, O
we O
are O
going O
to O
eat O
a O
group O
of O
friends, O
almost O
everyone O
likes O
fish O
and O
seafood O
very O
much O
but O
my O
wife O
does O
not O
do O
much O
“grace”, O
my O
doubt O
is O
that O
such O
is O
the O
offer O
of O
meat..ect...that O
more O
offers O
there O
are...thanks O
in O
advance O
a O

carlos O

Hello O
Jose O
Carlos: O
in O
the O
second O
tasting O
menu O
you O
can O
choose O
meat O
(I O
don't O
remember O
if O
entrecot O
or O
sirloin) O
or O
the O
fresh O
fish O
they O
have, O
I O
have O
always O
eaten O
fish O
but O
sure O
that O
the O
meat O
is O
of O
good O
quality O
as O
well. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
tasting O
menu O
you O
can O
also O
order O
normal O
card O
that O
there O
is O
of O
all O
the O
usual. O

Say O
hello. O

Pedro: O
I'm O
afraid O
you O
haven't O
tried O
the O
appropriate O
Aragones O
cavas O
like O
the O
Cava O
Monastery O
of O
Veruela O
or O
the O
Reinante, O
or O
the O
Real O
de O
Aragón,... O
any O
of O
these O
quality O
price O
ratios O
are O
above O
the O
Catalans. O

JoséI O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
Aragonese O
cavas: O
Bordejé, O
Bordejé O
chardonnay, O
Monastery O
of O
Veruela, O
Crown O
of O
Aragon,... O
and O
all O
those O
I O
have O
tried O
so O
far O
leave O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
from O
my O
humble O
point O
of O
view. O

Above O
all, O
they O
lack O
freshness O
and O
fruitiness O
and O
often O
sin O
from O
a O
certain O
excitement. O

A O
very O
notable O
exception, O
that O
of O
Lalanne O
wineries O
(Lucrecia O
Lalanne O
brut O
nature)I O
have O
not O
tried O
either O
Reinante O
or O
Real O
de O
Aragón. O

I O
assure O
you, O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
have O
occasion, O
I O
will O
try O
them O
and O
right O
here O
I O
will O
give O
you O
the O
reason O
in O
case O
I O
like O
them. O

Very O
nice O

Very O

By O
chance O
my O
partner O
and O
I O
ended O
up O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
they O
offer O
us O
the O
menu O
and O
menu O
of O
the O
day, O
we O
choose O
the O
menu. O

First O
salpicon O
of O
octopus O

tosta O
of O
scalabada O
and O
black O

with O
pickled O
quail O
and O
second O
duck O
magret O
with O
peach O
sauce O
and O
cous-cous O
and O
trisco O

the O
truth O
is O
that O
we O
went O
out O
very O
happy O
as O
the O

was O
very O

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
although O
the O
" O
tent B-TARGET
" O
is O
a O
fairground. O

The O
service B-TARGET
very O
just, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
a O
little O
decadent, O
and O
both O
paella, B-TARGET
as O
the O
noodle, O
tasteless, O
precast O
and O
almost O
inedible. O

Wrong, O
we're O
not O
coming O
back. O

An O
excellent O
Christmas O
day. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
was O
very O
varied O
and O
abundant, O
and O
the O
products B-TARGET
were O
very O
high O
quality. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
perfect. O

There O
were O
many O
waiters, B-TARGET
worrying O
that O
no O
one O
was O
missing O
anything O
and O
that O
they O
felt O
at O
ease. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
to O
enjoy O
this O
Restaurent B-TARGET
with O
Shifts. O

Nice O
waiters, B-TARGET
appreciable O
food, B-TARGET
not O
exceptional, O
fair O
price... B-TARGET
awful O
noise, B-TARGET
lots O
of O
people O
around O
to O
get O
places... O
which O
bothers O
more O
than O
necessary O

A O
little O
expensive. O

Good. O

Very O
good O

very O
good O

An O
excellent O
organization. B-TARGET

You O
have O
a O

I O
love O
fish B-TARGET
in O
Salamanca! O

Always O
very O
cool O
(normal!) O

and O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
speaks O
all O
the O
languages! O

That's O
why O
I O
go O
back O
every O
year! O

Only O
the O
pink O
wine B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
medium O

In O
general O
all O
right O

We O
went O
on O
a O
Sunday O
to O
celebrate O
my O
70th O
anniversary O
with O
my O
children O
and O
friends. O

Excellent. O

Good O
attention O
to O
the O
waiter, B-TARGET
although O
he O
had O
too O
many O
tables O
and O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
get O
his O
attention O
to O
ask O
for O
something. O

The O
imperial B-TARGET
marshmallow I-TARGET
is O
impressive, O
although O
it O
was O
served O
to O
us O
somewhat O
cold. O

If O
you O
choose O
seafood, B-TARGET
don't O
ask O
for O
anything O
as O
an O
entrée O
(the O
waiter O
recommended O
us O
to O
choose O
an O
entrée O
that O
came O
along O
with O
the O
mariscada, O
and O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
finish O
with O
it) O

We O
went O
on O
Christmas O
Day. O

It O
was O
not O
our O
online O
reservation, O
and O
they O
told O
us O
that O
it O
was O
better O
to O
contact O
them O
directly. O

At O
the O
table B-TARGET
that O
we O
were O
prepared, O
there O
was O
water O
from O
the O
ceiling, O
and O
we O
were O
attached O
to O
the O
heating. O

Of O
the O
8 O
Christmas O
menus, B-TARGET
available O
only O
1... O
it O
is O
true O
that O
we O
ate O
well, O
but O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
of O
humor.. O

My O
father O
and O
brother O
are O
going O
to O
eat O
once O
a O
week O
in O
Salamanca O
for O
many O
years O
(weekly) O
because O
they O
feel O
at O
home O
and O
in O
general O
my O
whole O
family O
likes O
it O
very O
much. O

Regarding O
the O
service O
I O
disagree O
with O
the O
criticism O
from O
below, O
both O
Silvestre O
(entranable) O
and O
his O
entire O
team O
treat O
exceptionally O
all O
their O
diners, O
which O
together O
with O
the O
beauty O
of O
all O
their O
salons O
makes O
you O
feel O
in O
a O
special O
place. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
in O
January O
with O
a O
commitment O
to O
work O
and O
in O
these O
cases O
I O
always O
go O
there O
because O
it's O
safe O
bet. O

The O
imperial O
seafood O
is O
excellent O
although O
if O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
throw O
so O
high O
the O
grilled O
fish O
and O
seafood O
is O
another O
very O
good O
option. O

Its O
rice O
is O
remarkable O
and O
the O
permanent O
detail O
of O
the O
santiago O
and O
the O
pomegranate O
bottles O
on O
the O
table O
is O
appreciated. O

<->I O
don't O
know O

Well O
communicated O
and O
comfortable O

Expensive O
for O
what O
they O
feed, O
tables B-TARGET
very O
close O
together O
and O
quite O
noise. O

Good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
loose O
paella. B-TARGET

Very O
touristy. O

Good O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
center O
of O
Barcelona O
delant O
de O
mar. O

I've O
been O
eating O
with O
a O
friend O
and O
we've O
had O
some O
very O
well-recommended O
entrees, B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
a O
Perelada O
Paella. O

Everything O
Perfect O
and O
as O
always, O
the O
optimal O
service. B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
safe O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
always O
go O
and O
repeat O
its O
traditional O
dishes. B-TARGET
