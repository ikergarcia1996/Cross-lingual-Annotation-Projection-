We O
feel O
very O
pleasant. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
friendly O
and O
quiet O
environment, B-TARGET
good O
food. B-TARGET

Very O
recommended O

The O
attention B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
waiting O
for O
one O
all O
the O
time. O

And O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
spectacular, O
that’s O
why O
good O
is O
paid O
for. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
saw O
flojo O
is O
that O
I O
ordered O
a O
bit O
of O
Provence B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
charged, O
so O
you O
gave O
it O
all O
right. O

Nothing O
special. O

I O
had O
wonderful O
comments O
and O
it’s O
fine, O
but O
nothing O
more. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
good, O
but O
like O
many O
others. O

The O
price, O
so O
is O
the O
food, B-TARGET
for O
my O
taste O
is O
high. O

the O
quality O
of O
the O
product, B-TARGET
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
environment B-TARGET
all O
was O
excellent O

9 B-TARGET
queens I-TARGET
has O
already O
been O
one O
of O
the O
best O
experiences O
we O
have O
had O
in O
recent O
years. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
at O
the O
same O
level. O

The O
right O
prices O
and O
well O
you O
can O
make O
a O
greater O
or O
lesser O
spending O
depending O
on O
your O
pocket O
because O
the O
letter B-TARGET
is O
very O
wide. O

We O
will O
return. O

Fantastic, O
very O
attentive O
food B-TARGET
excellent O
and O
a O
great O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

My O
friends O
were O
delighted O
and O
we O
too. O

It O
is O
worth O
it O
to O
go O
and O
try O
their O
meats. B-TARGET

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
beautiful, O
modern O
and O
welcoming. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
quality. O

Very O
attentive O

We O
have O
been O
several O
times O
to O
dinner O
at O
the O
9 B-TARGET
queens I-TARGET
and O
never O
disappointed! O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
meats B-TARGET
the O
excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
its O
good O
cellar B-TARGET
makes O
it O
a O
spectacular O
place!! O

We O
will O
definitely O
repeat. O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
high O
quality O
meat. B-TARGET

I O
adore O
it! O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
everything O
very O
well; O
the O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
and O
appearance, B-TARGET
all O
right. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
and O
we O
really O
it. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
great O
food B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
treatment. B-TARGET

Totally O
Recommended O

It O
was O
all O
excellent, O
the O
quality, O
the O
times, B-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(quizas O
too O
illuminated) O
and O
the O
service. B-TARGET

The O
sweet B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
milk I-TARGET
is O
divine. O

This O
was O
my O
first O
visit O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
very O
good O
result. O

Quality, O
professionalism O
and O
price O
in O
line O
with O
the O
offer. O

Just O
like O
in O
Argentina. O

It O
is O
fantastic!! O

It O
is O
delicious!! O

Fantastic O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
even O
better!!!! O

Great O
kindness, B-TARGET
it O
is O
a O
taste! O

Very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
there O
are O
no O
dishes B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
bread, I-TARGET
but O
despite O
that, O
everything O
is O
fine. O

It O
was O
Argentine B-TARGET
music. I-TARGET

Prices O
are O
within O
normal O
parameters. O

I O
was O
at O
a O
business O
dinner O
yesterday O
with O
a O
customer O
and O
both O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

Congratulations O
to O
you!! O

A O
good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
though O
somewhat O
expensive O
for O
the O
amount O
of O
food B-TARGET
served O
on O
the O
plate. O

The O
normal O
roast, B-TARGET
nothing O
extraordinary. O

The O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
the O
matambre. B-TARGET

It O
could O
improve O
the O
lighting B-TARGET
in O
the O
upper O
floor, O
too O
much O
flat O
light. O

100% O
is O
recommended. O

A O
beautiful O
place, B-TARGET
with O
a O
wonderful O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food!! B-TARGET

Excellent O
salads B-TARGET
and O
meat. B-TARGET

A O
lot O
of O
food. B-TARGET

You O
won’t O
get O
hungry O
and O
the O
cleansing O
is O
excellent. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
meats B-TARGET
is O
unbeatable O
and O
I O
want O
to O
highlight O
the O
excellent O
service B-TARGET
received. O

If O
you O
haven’t O
tried O
their O
meat, B-TARGET
you’re O
missing O
out O
on O
something O
very O
big! O

I O
had O
dinner O
with O
some O
friends O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
rich O
and O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
of O
the O
waitresses O
excellent. O

We O
will O
definitely O
repeat!! O

The O
best O
thing O
is O
to O
be O
advised O
by O
them B-TARGET
when O
choosing O
a O
dish. O

I O
love O
it!! O

Quit O
the O
words, O
I’ll O
be O
back! O

The O
restaurants B-TARGET
ate O
very O
well O
and O
also O
a O
charming O
and O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

We O
take O
Vacuo O
and O
Entrañas O
(specialities O
known, O
among O
other O
things, O
for O
the O
softness O
of O
their O
meat). O

At O
some O
point, O
we O
came O
to O
wonder O
if O
what O
we O
had O
in O
our O
mouth O
was O
meat B-TARGET
or O
a O
piece O
of O
tire. O

Disappointed... O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
excellent, O
the O
service B-TARGET
super O
friendly O
and O
always O
attentive. O

Very O
welcoming O
environment. B-TARGET

An O
unforgettable O
culinary O
experience. B-TARGET

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET

Everything O
very O
good O

Intimate O
and O
quiet O
environment, B-TARGET
good O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
good O
quality O
in O
the O
meats. B-TARGET

The O
price O
is O
a O
bit O
high O
but O
reasonable. O

Excellent O
charter, B-TARGET
exquisite O
meats, B-TARGET
rich O
specialties, B-TARGET
intimate O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
quality-price O
ratio. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
environment B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
rich, O
but O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
extremely O
noisy O
(especially O
the O
upper O
floor). O

There O
was O
a O
time O
when O
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
noise. B-TARGET

Very O
little O
privacy. B-TARGET

Maybe O
good O
for O
group O
dinners, O
but O
couples O
abstain. O

Local B-TARGET
almost O
perfect, O
kitchen B-TARGET
impeccable, O
quantity O
more O
than O
abundant, O
extensive O
letter B-TARGET
(food O
and O
wines) O
and O
price O
appropriate O
to O
what O
offer. O

Very O
recommended O
therefore. O

As O
a O
greeting, O
I O
will O
say O
that, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
head B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
room O
(or O
owner, O
thing O
I O
don’t O
know), O
attentive, O
educated O
and O
detailed, O
the O
rest B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
service, O
wireless O
pinganillos O
included, O
is O
not O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
rest, O
more O
in O
terms O
of O
education O
and O
forms O
than O
capacity: O
you O
would O
have O
to O
take O
care O
of O
aspects O
such O
as O
removing O
almost O
to O
the O
race O
dishes O
without O
finishing, O
tweeting O
by O
default O
or O
offering O
silence O
as O
any O
response O
to O
the O
question O
of O
the O
comensal O
in O
the O
choice O
between O
two O
options. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
successfully O
investing O
in O
the O
complicated O
(local, B-TARGET
raw O
material, B-TARGET
image, B-TARGET
website) B-TARGET
you O
ignore O
the O
basics: O
a O
couple O
of O
discolored O
waiters B-TARGET
that O
lower O
a O
customer’s O
rating O
from O
an O
excellent O
to O
a O
remarkable O
high. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
dinner O
for O
the O
place B-TARGET
and O
especially O
for O
the O
food. B-TARGET

They O
have O
a O
fairly O
extensive O
card B-TARGET
where O
each O
dish O
looks O
better O
than O
the O
previous O
one. O

For O
the O
lovers O
of O
meat O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
Chef's B-TARGET
Solomillo, I-TARGET
exquisite. O

Even O
though O
the O
products B-TARGET
are O
of O
high O
quality, O
the O
price O
is O
high. O

<+>The O
place O
and O
its O
situation O

I O
can O
only O
say O
good O
things O
about O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
ate O
well O
and O
well O
served. O

The O
very O
fresh O
cakes. B-TARGET

Wonderful O
as O
it O
is O
decorated. O

Very O
nice O
and O
with O
incredible O
views. B-TARGET

Of O
the O
food B-TARGET
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
say, O
but O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
touched, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
kind, O
ultimately O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
is O
hot O
price B-TARGET
totally O
unbalanced. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
several O
times. O

The O
food B-TARGET
very O
good. O

What O
I O
don’t O
like O
is O
service. B-TARGET

The O
last O
day O
we O
went O
we O
asked O
oysters B-TARGET
and O
we O
sat O
down O
badly, O
apart O
from O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
served O
the O
cava O
chopping O
the O
whole O
table...it O
will O
be O
a O
long O
time O
until O
q O
comes O
back... O

We O
were O
on O
a O
Monday O
night O
in O
July. O

The O
only O
smile O
we O
saw O
among O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
from O
the O
girl O
who O
led O
us O
to O
our O
desk. O

From O
there, O
serious O
faces O
(not O
to O
say O
of O
bad O
mood), O
distracted, O
of O
the O
waiters... B-TARGET
that O
sometimes O
were O
made O
to O
wait, O
and O
other O
times O
were O
balanced O
to O
settle O
the O
table. O

It’s O
covered B-TARGET
in O
bad O
places, O
without O
the O
slightest O
delicacy. O

Poorly O
presented O
dishes, B-TARGET
flying O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
beginners. O

Really O
bad O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
decent, O
although O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
price O
was O
not O
up O
to O
the O
height. O

I'm O
sorry, O
but O
I O
don't O
recommend O
it O
under O
such O
conditions. O

Greetings O

It O
is O
no O
longer O
what O
it O
was...Ramon, O
has O
fallen O
a O
lot, O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
quality O
of O
food, B-TARGET
the O
only O
thing, O
the O
terrace. B-TARGET

Last O
Saturday, O
at O
13h, O
little O
people, O
i.e., O
kitchen O
without O
strawberries, O
paella,simply B-TARGET
regrettable. O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona. O

Business O
dinner O
at O
more O
than O
50 O
€ O
pp O
and O
first: O
longaniza O
de O
vic? O

Or O
maybe O
Lidl? O

one O
or O
two O
pp; O
second O
bacon B-TARGET
to O
small O
lawn O
with O
"dry" O
can O
/ O
meat B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
fast O
food O
fried O
potatoes. O

For O
the O
price O
could O
have O
been O
“pellets O
and O
fries,” O
right? O

In O
the O
end, O
full O
of O
tourists B-TARGET
who O
come O
only O
once O
(from O
the O
cruises?) O

It O
doesn’t O
matter O
if O
the O
customer O
comes O
back. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
the O
price B-TARGET
and O
quality; B-TARGET
before O
it O
was O
not O
so! O

It O
was O
a O
dinner O
for O
4 O
on O
Saturday O
it O
was O
full. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
perfect. O

The O
delicious O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Through O
the O
years O
I O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
is O
a O
sure O
value. O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
data O
in O
the O
file. O

The O
quality O
price O
ratio O
is O
also O
good O
around O
50 O
€ O
per O
person O
but O
for O
a O
perfect O
dinner O
I O
do O
not O
consider O
it O
expensive. O

Unfortunate B-TARGET
cheddar I-TARGET
rice O
(for O
guiris, O
it O
can O
be O
good) O
and O
expensive O
in O
general. O

Very O
good, O
quality, O
service O
that O
justifies O
its O
price. O

And O
of O
vulgar O
nothing O
of O
nothing, O
the O
opposite. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
those O
who O
are O
able O
to O
appreciate O
and O
value O
the O
gastronomic B-TARGET
pleasure. I-TARGET

Personally O
this O
restaurant, O
already O
by O
the O
service O
and O
attitude O
of O
the O
waiters, B-TARGET
the O
maitrê B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
I O
think O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
deserves O
a O
Michelin O
star, O
as O
it O
eats O
very O
well, O
they O
are O
great O
people. B-TARGET

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
the O
situation B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

However, O
the O
price O
is O
very O
high O
and O
over O
time O
has O
gone O
up O
spectacularly O
without O
improving O
the O
product. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it. O

and O
dear. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
always O
good. O

If O
you O
touch O
near O
the O
luxurious O
windows. O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
the O
service O
of O
the O
waitress. B-TARGET

The O
reception B-TARGET
was O
chaotic. O

As O
for O
the O
card, O
the O
lubin B-TARGET
tartar, I-TARGET
supreme O
as O
well O
as O
its O
desserts. B-TARGET

We O
will O
return. O

thanks O

Great O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
and O
its O
manufacture. O

and O
excellent O
service. O

Unbeatable O
homogeneity B-TARGET

You O
cannot O
ask O
for O
more. O

I O
have O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
every O
time O
I O
travel O
to O
Barcelona O
and O
it O
has O
always O
been O
excellent. O

I O
can O
only O
recommend O
it O
because O
it O
is O
undoubtedly O
one O
of O
the O
safest O
values O
in O
the O
County O
City. O

Immaculate O
service O
and O
it O
feels O
great! O

Good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
good O
quality O
in O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
only O
disadvantage O
is O
that O
it O
is O
very O
noisy O
and O
in O
some O
places O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
very O
sticky O
to O
each O
other O
and O
I O
think O
that O
for O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
they O
could O
have O
the O
tables O
more O
separate. O

Good O
luck B-TARGET
on O
the O
plank O

The O
perfect O
place. B-TARGET

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service. O

To O
go O
and O
repeat. O

Excellent O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
past. O

The O
attention O
and O
care O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
its O
master B-TARGET
are O
worthy O
of O
reward. O

A O
secure O
value. O

Product B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Catalan O
cuisine O
and O
seafood O
of O
a O
very O
good O
level O
and O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

A O
very O
homogeneous O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
will O
never O
disappoint. O

I O
repeat O
whenever O
I O
can, O
with O
the O
family O
or O
with O
the O
company. O

The O
attention B-TARGET
is O
exquisite O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
(fideua, O
robes O
and O
entrances) O
of O
very O
good O
quality. O

The O
price O
is O
worth O
it O
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
more. O

Very O
recommended. O

It O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
offers O
quality O
and O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
well O
cooked O
and O
with O
fresh O
elements. O

Good O
environment B-TARGET
and O
mediocre O
service. B-TARGET

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
for O
a O
birthday O
with O
friends O
and O
it O
was O
fantastic, O
a O
good O
deal B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
3 B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and O
hot B-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
apple I-TARGET
pure... I-TARGET

Quality/Price O
:high, O
the O
location B-TARGET
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
very O
pleasant, O
but O
inside B-TARGET
there O
is O
an O
excess O
of O
noise O
that O
makes O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
do O
not O
enjoy O
the O
food, O
I O
sincerely O
prefer O
others O
where O
I O
find O
myself O
more O
agusto. O

A O
magnificent O
place O
to O
eat O
good O
seafood B-TARGET
and O
any O
of O
its O
arroces O
or O
suquet, O
although O
very O
recommended, O
would O
not O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
romantic O
intimate O
dinner, B-TARGET
since O
the O
conversations O
of O
the O
even O
neighbors O
are O
very O
animated, O
since O
the O
local O
pays O
for O
it, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
of O
families O
or O
groups O
in O
general. O

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
magnificent O
views B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
quality-price O
ratio, O
always O
considering O
that O
the O
quality O
is O
very O
high. O

More O
than O
recommended. O

I O
have O
been O
several O
times O
but O
the O
site O
is O
for O
tourists O
and O
although O
the O
quality O
is O
good O
the O
price O
is O
exaggerated O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
especially O
in O
terms O
of O
reservations. O

I O
will O
use O
it O
only O
as O
a O
last O
resort. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
great O
place, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
great O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
great, O
worthy O
of O
admiration. O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
with O
someone O
special O
(like O
I O
was.) O

I O
was O
back O
at O
the O
Barceloneta O
Restaurant O
and O
could O
once O
again O
enjoy O
an O
excellent O
meal: B-TARGET

Some O
magnificent O
entrances: O
Buñuelos B-TARGET

Bacalao, I-TARGET
Revuelto B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
ceps I-TARGET
con I-TARGET
butifarra I-TARGET
y O
gambas B-TARGET
al I-TARGET
ajillo. I-TARGET

The O
main O
dish O
is O
a O
paella O
of O
fish O
and O
seafood. O

Dessert O
the O
magnificent O
Tiramisú B-TARGET
and O
a O
Galician B-TARGET
Cheese I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Tetilla I-TARGET
with I-TARGET

by O
D.O O

by O
Somontano. O

The O
first O
product, B-TARGET
excellent O
preparation O
and O
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

The O
natural B-TARGET
light I-TARGET
that O
enters O
through O
the O
glass O
bar O
of O
the O
terrace, O
added O
to O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
so O
welcoming O
gives O
a O
sense O
of O
well-being O
difficult O
to O
get O
elsewhere. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
as O
many O
times O
as O
I O
can O
and O
whenever O
I O
visit O
Barcelona. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants. O

As O
I’ve O
already O
read O
in O
some O
comments, O
of O
the O
few O
sites O
where O
you O
pay O
for O
what B-TARGET
you I-TARGET
eat, I-TARGET
and O
you O
eat O
well, O
very O
well. O

It O
is O
a O
fantastic O
place B-TARGET
for O
the O
good O
quality O
of O
its O
products. B-TARGET

The O
arroces B-TARGET
and O
suquets B-TARGET
are O
excellent. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
impressive, O
with O
a O
beautiful O
terrace O
overlooking O
the O
port. O

The O
service, B-TARGET
but O
it O
is O
correct. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
exceptional O
to O
my O
taste. O

The O
prices, O
depending O
on O
what O
you O
request, O
can O
be O
between O
40 O
and O
60 O
euros O
per O
person. O

Highlight O
the O
arroces, B-TARGET
the O
caldereta B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
bogavante, I-TARGET
the O
strawberries B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
oven O
and O
the O
"picoteo" B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
fish B-TARGET
in O
general. O

Improved O
quality. O

Especially O
exquisite O
are O
the O
baccarat B-TARGET
butterflies I-TARGET
and O
cheddar B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
ah O
and O
vicious O
jam. B-TARGET

One O
of O
the O
best O
paellas B-TARGET
I O
have O
eaten O
at O
a O
restaurant O
in O
Barcelona. O

It O
also O
has O
an O
impressive O
terrace. B-TARGET

If O
you O
are O
careful O
with O
what O
you O
ask, O
you O
can O
eat O
very O
well O
without O
leaving O
your O
wallet. O

Totally O
recommended. O

Possibly O
the O
restaurant O
with O
the O
best O
terrace B-TARGET
in O
Barcelona, O
with O
sea O
views O
and O
great O
food. B-TARGET

Good O
service B-TARGET
but O
little O
sympathy. O

Very O
good O
rice B-TARGET
but O
very O
little O

Very O
expensive O

We O

We O
are O

thank O
you O

telling O
us. O

Authentic O

the O

level. O

The O

one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city. O

He O
enchanted O
us. O

Dinner O

the O

Great O

It O

Excellent O

Very O

service. B-TARGET

You O
can O
only O
see O
that O
he O
is O
always O
running O
out. O

Without O
hesitation, O
we O
will O
come O
back!! O

I O
applied O
for O
the O
terrace O
reservation O
and O
I O
think O
I O
was O
at O
one O
of O
the O
best O
terrace O
tables. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
in O
both O
education O
and O
care. O

Speed O
in O
order B-TARGET
management I-TARGET
and O
quality O
in O
line O
with O
price. O

Maybe O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
and O
wines B-TARGET
are O
a O
bit O
expensive. O

Orange O
juice B-TARGET
6€ O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
bit O
exaggerated. O

We O
ate O
well, O
served O
kindly, O
took O
2 O
dishes O
a O
long O
time O
and O
I O
don't O
like O
that O
even O
staying O
in O
the O
paella O
and O
fideua O
but O
ration, O
they O
took O
it O
without O
asking. O

I O
can O
only O
give O
a O
10 O
to O
your O
kitchen B-TARGET
of O
incomparable O
quality O
and O
freshness. O

The O
only O
surprise O
was O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
coffee, B-TARGET
as O
I O
was O
served O
the O
same O
as O
in O
the O
Burger O
King. O

For O
the O
rest O
10. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
local B-TARGET
is O
very O
acceptable, O
but O
the O
price O
quality O
relationship O
is O
decompensated.you O
would O
have O
to O
explain O
to O
the O
cook,that O
the O
pulp B-TARGET
is O
not O
heated O
in O
the O
microwave O
and O
less O
if O
you O
put O
the O
pepper O
and O
oil O
as O
it O
burns O
and O
reseces. O

The O
rest, O
passable O
and O
without O
more O
pretensions O
but O
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
we O
were O
charged. O

very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
including O
car O
parking, O
this O
is O
all O
on O
the O
level O
of O
excellent O
quality. O

The O
service B-TARGET
does O
not O
know O
the O
letter B-TARGET
which O
also O
lowers O
the O
quality O
it O
used O
to O
have. O

It O
is O
a O

that O
the O

not O
accompany O
you O

enjoy O
your O
pleasant O
terrace B-TARGET
with O

We O
will O

come O
back O

very O
rich O
arroces, B-TARGET
attentive O
and O

service. B-TARGET

Quality O
and O
good O
service B-TARGET
are O
the O
adjectives. O

This O
is O
a O
classic O
in O
Barcelona. O

Dinner O
at O
a O
restaurant O
special O
for O
us. O

Preparation O
of O
the O
dishes, O
fish B-TARGET
in O
both O
cases, O
correct O

presentation O
left O
much O
to O
be O

Service B-TARGET
so O
attentive O
that O
at O
the O
end O
it O
becomes O
heavy, O
urgency O
to O
empty O
the O
dishes O
of O

us. O

It’s O

Very O
pleased, O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O
to O
my O
friends. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
local B-TARGET
pleasant O
but O
"allowed O

unthinkable O
in O
a O
area O
that O
was O
"terrace" O
and O
that O
was O
communicated O
with O
the O
salon O
and O
with O

That O
if O
it O

they O
changed O
my O

after O
so O
much O

I O
had O
to O

Despite O
being O

restaurant, O
my O
husband O
found O
the O
filet B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
green I-TARGET

he O
asked O
very O
good. O

Very O
good O
deal. B-TARGET

I O
ordered O
a O
table O
well O
located O
and O
they O
answered O
the O
request, O
they O
gave O
us O
one O
with O
very O
good O

We O
celebrated O
my O
partner’s O
birthday O
and O
everything O
was O

Good O

I O
selected O
the O
restaurant O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
and O
I O
love O
myself O
and O
everyone, O
the O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
next O
time O
we O
will O
ask O
a O
little O
further O
away O
from O
the O
kitchen O
pq O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
jaleo B-TARGET
in O
that O
area. O

I O
would O
have O
liked O
in O
the O
first O
line O
to O
the O
glassbar, O
but O
when O
I O
booked O
I O
was O
commented O
that O
there O
was O
no O
place, O
again O
it O
will O
be. O

Overall O
very O
good O
and O
recommended. O

They O
have O
a O
fast O
and O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

Good O

Excellent O

Very O
good, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Some O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excessively O
expensive O
considering O
the O
amount O
presented, O
but O
it O
hasn’t O
surprised O
us. O

We O
ate O
at O
Barcelona O
today. O

As O
the O
forums O
and O
opinion O
say, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
the O
quality O
ratio O
price O
(of O
the O
food) B-TARGET
acceptable. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
has O
a O
totally O
excessive O
price O
(3 O
times O
the O
price O
in O
the O
store.) O

Regarding O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
place O
to O
indicate O
that O
although O
the O
service O
is O
good, O
this O
seems O
more O
of O
a O
menu O
restaurant O
than O
a O
restaurant O
of O
70 O
euros O
per O
person O
(easily, O
hastily, O
hastily). O

The O
distance O
between O
tables B-TARGET
is O
worthy O
of O
a O
menu O
restaurant. O

In O
genral O
it O
is O
fine, O
but O
if O
you O
took O
care O
of O
those O
small O
details O
(especially O
the O
distance O
between O
tables) O
it O
would O
be O
better. O

Perfect O
as O
always... O

A O
good O
place O
to O
eat O
good O
seafood B-TARGET
and O
fish B-TARGET
in O
a O
privileged O
environment B-TARGET
and O
in O
a O
spacious, O
bright O
and O
pleasant O
local, B-TARGET
although O
somewhat O
noisy O
(it O
is O
very O
large). O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
comfortable O
(parking O
your O
car). O

I O
went, O
once O
again, O
with O
a O
friend O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
Barceloneta O
Restaurant. O

Never O
to O
disappoint. O

Good O
quality O
products, B-TARGET
perfectly O
prepared. O

It’s O
always O
as O
good, O
with O
an O
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

A O

Chef I-TARGET
who O
always O
remembers O
and O
greets O
the O
regular O
customers, O
even O
if O
months O
have O
passed O
since O
the O
last O
time O
they O
visited O
the O
restaurant. O

A B-TARGET
secure I-TARGET
value. I-TARGET

A B-TARGET
“blue I-TARGET
chip” I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
restoration. I-TARGET

It O
is O
hard O
to O
decide O
what O
is O
the O
most O
outstanding, O
the O
service, B-TARGET
the O
food... B-TARGET

Very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
good O
quality/price O
ratio. O

It’s O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places B-TARGET
that O
still O
remain O
where O
you O
pay O
depending O
on O
how O
you O
eat. O

It’s O
not O
cheap, O
but O
at O
least O
the O
quality O
is O
in O
line O
with O
the O
price. O

I O
recommend O
it. O

Very O
good O

As O

excellent. O

Hemosido O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
taking O
the O
Drawing B-TARGET
Menu I-TARGET
of O
the O
Days O
of O
the O
Horse O
and O
the O
Goat O
and O
although O
they O
have O
offered O
us O
the O
possibility O
of O
other O
options, O
we O
have O
taken O
what O
we O
had O
thought, O
regarding O
the O
menu, O
nothing O
to O
object, O
all O
perfect O
and O
according O
to O
expectations, O
the O
service B-TARGET
totally O
correct O
and O
diligent O
without O
falling O
into O
the O
weight, O
total O
a O
perfect O
evening, O
as O
to O
repeat O
and O
recommend. O

We O
tried O
the O
cava O
menu. O

We O
have O
known O
the O
restaurant O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
so O
we O
thought O
we O
were O
on O
insurance. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
what O
we O
ate O
was O
great, O
but O
we O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
quantity, O
which O
was O
rather O
scarce. O

We O
booked O
through O
the O
website O
and O
the O
menu O
did O
not O
disappoint O
us, O
we O
chose O
the O
cabritillo B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
what O
we O
expected, O
good O
quality O
and O
quantity O
more O
than O
acceptable. O

If O
it O
could O
be O
a O
little O
cheaper O
it O
would O
be O
perfect. O

I’ve O
been O
there O
twice O
and O
I O
love O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
cock B-TARGET
is O
great. O

It O
was O
a O
pity O
not O
to O
finish O
the O
potatoes, B-TARGET
which O
were O
very O
good O
on O
top. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
rich. O

It O
is O
worth O
going. O

Good O
food, B-TARGET
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
with O
great O
service. B-TARGET

The O
roast B-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
the O
Chema O
cellar O
several O
times O
lately. O

The O
specialty O
of O
the O
restaurant O
(cabrito B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
potatoes) I-TARGET
is O
spectacular. O

In O
addition, O
it O
is O
the O
only O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
eat O
with O
guarantees O
and O
great O
quality. O

Generous O
rations B-TARGET
and O
closed O
prices O
without O
surprises, O
which O
is O
very O
rare O
nowadays. O

That O
is, O
very O
good O
price O
quality O
ratio.Excellent O
entrances O
(my O
weakness O
is O
the O
dried B-TARGET

Don’t O
miss O
the O
Mojito B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
cream. I-TARGET

We O
have O
repeated O
it O
and O
we O
will O
do O
it O
again. O

very O
well O

We O
were O
six O
people O
for O
a O
family O
celebration, O
it O
was O
our O
first O
time O
there, O
we O
ordered O
the O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
and O
we O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
everything O
very O
well O
cooked, O
reasonable O
amounts, O
some O
exquisite O
flavors O
combinations, O
we O
were O
very O
satisfied O
and O
eager O
to O
come O
back O
again. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
good, O
fast O
and O
without O
problems. O

I O
hope O
that O
you O
always O
continue O
with O
a O
desire O
to O
overcome O
and O
give O
the O
highest O
quality O
possible, O
at O
reasonable O
prices. O

We O
liked O
the O
menu B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
the O
presentation O
and O
service. B-TARGET

The O
wine B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
cava I-TARGET
as O
well. O

We O
were O
very O
pleasant. O

The O
quality-price O
ratio O
is O
very O
good. O

We O
will O
repeat. O

Happy O
year O

A O
fabulous O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
with O
a O
great O
meal B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
stay O
both O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
for O
the O
pleasant O
treatment B-TARGET
received, O
as O
in O
previous O
times, O
we O
will O
repeat. O

Happy O
the O
year. O

The O
food B-TARGET
the O
truth O
very O
good O
but O
the O
offer B-TARGET
q O
comes O
here O
then O
is O
not O
the O
same O
from O
there O
I O
come O
out O
5€ O
more O
expensive O
for O
pers O
the O
menu. O

Hi O
Ursula. O

It O
didn’t O
get O
you O
more O
expensive, O
what O
happened O
is O
that O
you O
ate O
the O
cabrito O
menu O
of O
32 O
euros, O
not O
the O
27-group O
menu O
you O
booked O
(32-27=5 O
euros). O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
you O
were O
two O
people O
to O
take O
the O
group O
menu O
and O
that O
is O
not O
possible, O
for O
two O
people O
is O
available O
the O
32 O
and O
the O
36, O
and O
you O
served O
and O
the O
32, O
and O
I O
am O
very O
happy O
that O
you O
liked O
it, O
that O
is O
what O
happened, O
the O
important O
thing O
in O
any O
case O
is O
that O
you O
would O
go O
out O
happy. O

and O
a O
greeting. O

The O
experience O
at O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
“La O
Bodega O
de O
Chema”, O
has O
been O
a O
very O
pleasant O
experience O
both O
for O
me O
and O
for O
the O
person O
who O
accompanied O
me. O

To O
say O
that O
the O
attention B-TARGET
from O
the O
people O
who O
work O
at O
this O
restaurant O
was O
friendly O
and O
polite. O

All O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
of O
our O
pleasure O
but O
the O
cabrito B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
oven O
was O
really O
spectacular. O

One O
point O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
is O
that O
at O
the O
time O
I O
requested O
the O
account, O
it O
had O
no O
increase, O
being O
exactly O
the O
amount O
that O
marked O
the O
chosen O
and O
booked O
menu B-TARGET
on O
the O
internet. O

It O
has O
been O
my O
pleasure O
that O
this O
is O
a O
place O
that O
I O
have O
already O
recommended O
to O
several O
of O
my O
friends. O

I O
think O
it’s O
a O
perfect O
thing O
to O
go O
both O
in O
a O
couple O
and O
with O
friends O
and O
I O
think O
no O
one O
who O
comes O
close O
to O
dinner O
will O
be O
unhappy. O

We O
ate O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
at O
the O
restaurant O
last O
Saturday, O
the O
thematic B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
trout I-TARGET
and O
the O
goat, B-TARGET
is O
great, O
balanced, O
good O
maybe O
too O
much, O
but O
we O
are O
good O
to O
eat O
and O
we O
know O
how O
to O
appreciate O
the O
good. O

They O
served O
us O
quickly, O
without O
waiting. O

Heritage O
wine O
“RED”, B-TARGET
delicious O
and O
pleasant O
to O
drink. O

The O
price O
is O
interesting, O
including O
VAT, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
deserves O
it. O

Keep O
doing O
this O
and O
you O
will O
continue O
to O
fill O
the O
dining O
room O
as O
always. O

We O
went O
out O
delighted O
from O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
excellent. O

I O
want O
to O
put O
it O
on O
my O
favorite O
list. O

Great O
the O

Very O
good O
the O
detail B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
house I-TARGET
and O
the O
entrances, B-TARGET
as O
well O
as O
a O
table B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cheeses I-TARGET
before O
desserts. O

All O
very O
recommended. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
a O
little O
slow. O

There O
was O
no O
need O
for O
the O
house O
to O
invite O
a O
chicken O
at O
the O
end. O

A O
rich O
menu. B-TARGET

I O
was O
delighted O
to O
be O
able O
to O
taste O
three O
entrances B-TARGET
and O
choose O
a O
second. B-TARGET

Friendly O
and O
professional O
service. O

A O
detail B-TARGET
to O
be O
able O
to O
take O
the O
food O
that O
was O
left O
over O
(it O
went O
with O
an O
older O
person O
who O
doesn’t O
eat O
much O
and O
put O
the O
remaining O
corvin O
in O
a O
container). O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
remember. O

A O
wonderful O
evening. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
great O
dinner. B-TARGET

To O
highlight O
the O
cabrito B-TARGET
and O
the O
mandarin B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
cream, I-TARGET
simply O
delicious. O

All O
dinner O
watered O
with O
a O
great O

we O
were O
recommended O
at O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
will O

safely. O

As O
always, O
very O
good O
quality O
price O
relationship O
and O
great O
service. B-TARGET

Yesterday O
for O
Valentine’s O
Day O
we O
asked O
the O
goat O
to O
order O
(which O
can O
be O
done). O

As O
always, O
fabulous, O
in O
addition O
with O
only O
heating O
the O
oven O
to O
180o O
for O
a O
moment, O
then O
hot O
for O
5 O
minutes, O
you O
give O
it O
sauce O
and O
eat. O

I O
will O
comment O
for O
if O
no O
one O
knows. O

and O
perfect. O

We O
have O
liked. O

and O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

Excellent O
food. B-TARGET

Very O
professional O
and O
friendly O

I O
was O
last O
Saturday O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
I O
liked O
it O
very O
much.Modern, O
different, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
funny O
and O
original O
letter. B-TARGET

The O
mini B-TARGET
hamburgers I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ternasco, I-TARGET
iberian I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
are O
well O
worth O
a O
visit. O

There O
is O
an O
important O
pointing O
that O
has O
not O
seemed O
to O
me O
to O
read O
in O
the O
criticism: O
the O
closed O
menu B-TARGET
of O
30€ O
is O
for O
groups O
of O
a O
minimum O
of O
8 O
people. O

I O
was O
on O
Saturday O
11 O
February, O
and O
my O
overall O
rating O
is O
Good. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
music B-TARGET
was O
great, O
great, O
it O
is O
rare O
in O
Zaragoza O
to O
find O
Bars O
with O
such O
good O
music. O

The O
pity O
was O
that O
we O
went O
to O
dinner O
and O
it O
was O
still O
not O
time O
to O
dance.Dinner, B-TARGET
regular. O

The O
quality O
acceptable, O
but O
the O
quantity O
scarce, O
we O
were O
5 O
girls, O
and O
not O
very O
dining, O
but O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
very O
small, O
especially O
the O
croquettes B-TARGET
and O
buñuelos, B-TARGET
the O
presentation B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
and O
the O
attention B-TARGET
from O
the O
Camareros, O
immeasurable. O

The O
economical O
cups, B-TARGET
and O
the O
show B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Drag’s I-TARGET
regular.In O
short, O
I O
give O
you O
a O
good O
score O
but O
more O
as O
a O
bar B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cups, I-TARGET
than O
for O
dinner, O
(per O
to O
chew, O
or O
picotear), O
but O
don’t O
wait O
to O
fill O
you, O
to O
us O
that O
you O
spend O
a O
past. O

Yes, O
but O
in O
a O
dance O

Hello O
very O
satisfying O
all O
starting O
with O
the O
attention O
at O
the O
reservations B-TARGET
responding O
very O
carefully O
to O
the O
request O
and O
then O
very O
well O
both O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
with O
the O
waiters O
and O
waiters O
and O
with O
the O
level O
of O
dinner B-TARGET
we O
recommended O
it O
to O
all O
our O
friends O
that O
they O
are O
not O
few O
and O
soon O
we O
will O
be O
there O
again O
to O
participate O
in O
the O

I O

I O
think O
there O
is O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
A O
loving O

Very O
well O
treated B-TARGET
and O
pleasantly, O
the O
only O
thing O
to O
dinner O
on O
a O
romantic B-TARGET
dinner I-TARGET
plan O
was O
a O
bit O
incompatible O
with O
the O
theme O
of O
the O
performance, O
being O
on O
a O
table O
too O
much O
between O
the O
entrance O
and O
the O
bar O
bar, O
since O
when O
the O
friendship O
of O
the O
artists, O

other O

invaded O
the O
intimate O
ambientillo, O
and O
no O
longer O
much O
appetite O
to O
continue O
there O
dining O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
people O
take O
drinks, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
to O
put O
them O
on O
a O
table O
by O
the O
bottom, O
without O
seeing O
the O
rush O
of O
people, O

next O

Very O
rich O
dinner B-TARGET

very O
attentive O

Thank O
you, O
until O
soon. O

This O
is O
the O
truth! O

I O
have O
been O
several O
times O
with O
young O
people O
and O
always O
have O
good O
reviews, O
of O
course, O
without O
exaggerating! O

To O
be O
the O
heroic O
street, O
it O
is O
worth O
spending O
a O
day...that O
if, O
it O
seems O
a O
bit O
unusual O
for O
me O
that O
Carlos O
has O
put O
in O
30 O
meters O
almost O
stuck O
three O
(the O
heads, O
the O
meccano O
and O
the O
tinglado)...besides O
things O
in O
common...I O
don’t O
know, O
I O
don’t O
see O
it, O
but O
he O
will O
know. O

hayyyyyy O
calamity..... O
if O
I O
already O
told O
you O
at O

I O
am O
an O
ex O

this O
restaurant O
to O
say O
something O
and O
I O
understand O
I O
was O
a O
chef O
of O
the O
kitchen O
and O
finally O
a O
disaster O
and O
that O
that O
lasted O
a O
month, O
there O
was O
no O
generosity, B-TARGET
I O
missed O
everything O
and O
the O
baby B-TARGET
(...) O

Take O
two O
pinches O
in O
the O
bar O
yesterday O
3-03-09 O
and O
I O
seemed O
all O
very O
unfortunate. O

With O
the O
level O
that O
every O
day O
there O
is O
in O
establishments O
across O
the O
city O
(left O
edge O
included), O
it O
is O
shameful O
that O
you O
take O
10 O
minutes O
to O
squeeze O
2 O
pins O
in O
salamanders O
and O
squeeze O
them O
in O
a O
rough O
way O
with O
simple O
onion O
oil. O

WITHOUT O
ENTRING O
TO O
VALUER O
THE O
WORSTS O
OF O
THE O
CAMARERA, B-TARGET
the O
discussions B-TARGET
between O
kitchen O
and O
bar O
and O
the O
deals B-TARGET
with O
distributors O
and O
representatives O
without O
respecting O
the O
presence O
of O
“only” O
two O
clients O
in O
the O

addition, O
they O
must O
be O
happy O
to O
charge O
between O
3.5 O
and O
5.5 O
euros O
per O
pinch, O
but O
they O
are O
far O
from O
making O
good O
miniature O
kitchen. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
going O
to O
Brothers O
Teresa O
in O
San O
Jose O
and O
to O
evohe O
or O
the O
jota O
on O
the O
left O
side O
to O
see O
what O
service, O
good O
product O
and O
originality O
deserve O
more O
respect O
than O
what O
La O
Despensa O
demonstrates. O

It O
is O
a O
pity, O
a O
pity. O

I O
was O
yesterday. O

Never O
again! O

We O
were O
surprised O
by O
such O
high O
prices, O
3.5€ O
a O
crochet. B-TARGET

We O
were O
commenting O
on O
it O
as O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
letter O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
must O
have O
heard O
us O
and O
took O
the O
letter O
from O
our O
noses. O

We O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
disgrace, O
but O
no, O
they O
started O
cushioning O
the O
cook B-TARGET
and O
waitress, B-TARGET
criticizing O
us O
and O
laughing O
at O
us O
and O
in O
the O
most O
disgraceful O
way, O
then O
they O
also O
mocked O
a O
gentleman O
who O
was O
next O
to O
us O
with O
his O
lady. O

They O
want O
to O
cheat O
us O
by O
paying O
for O
more!! O

I O
will O
never O
go O
back O
and O
will O
not O
recommend O
it. O

It O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
respect O
to O
laugh O
at O
people O
and O
more O
if O
they O
are O
your O
customers. O

They O
are O
disrespectful. O

I O
was O
last O
week O
and O
it's O
a O
site O
unfortunate O
camarers, B-TARGET
one O
is O
the O
owner, B-TARGET
they're O
quite O
unfortunate O
the O
only O
one O
that O
works O
is O
a O
blonde B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
who O
does O
the O
impossible O
to O
please O
and O
tap O
the O

besides O
very O

Recommend O
it O
to O
your O

to O
people O
who O
fall O

I O
went O
with O
my O

and O
I O
will O
not O
come O
back O
even O
if O
they O
give O
me O
food. O

A O
disappointment O

I O
copy O
what O
I O
already O
wrote O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
on O
another O
website O
after O
my, O
also O
painful, O
visit O
to O
this O
basement.”I B-TARGET
went O
with O
some O
friends O
to O
whom O
I O
had O
given O
a O
good O
impression O
by O
taking O
some O
tapas. O

There O
is O
a O
plasticized O
and O
priceless O
list O
of O
suggestions, B-TARGET
included O
on O
the O
letter O
and O
as O
long O
as O
the O
letter. O

I O
read O
even O
more O
suggestions. B-TARGET

We O
asked O
for O
several O
of O
the O
suggestions O
from O
the O
listing, O
because O
the O
normal O
card B-TARGET
was O
very O
unoriginal.All O
cost O
between O
23 O
and O
28 O
€, O
including O
salads! B-TARGET

Very O
expensive, O
very O
expensive O
for O
quality. O

Also O
having O
to O
run O
out O
on O
time, O
because O
they O
turn O
to O
dinner. O

This O
price O
is O
an O
insult O
to O
me. O

I O
will O
not O
return. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
two O
for O
giving O
me O
the O
information, O
some O
day O
I O
went O
on O
taping O
in O
the O
bar O
but O
has O
not O
given O
me O
down, O
do O
not O
do O
it O
because O
so O
you O
put O
more O
than O
go O
down O
to O
the O
salon, B-TARGET
down O
to O
hell. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
economy O
for O
people O
to O
pay O
60 O
euros O
for O
a O
salad B-TARGET
and O
a O
meat, B-TARGET
in O
the O
absence O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert, O
per O
person O
according O
to O
the O
wine O
you O
go O
to O
80 O
euros. O

Well O
said O
thanks. O

I’ve O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
twice O
and O
I O
really O
liked O
it. O

Casually O
we O
also O
dined O
the O
tempura B-TARGET
and O
we O
delighted, O
second O
I O
ate O
cochinillo, B-TARGET
I O
came O
with O
bones O
(in O
other O
places O
they O
give O
it O
osseous) O
but O
it O
was O
rich, O
my O
wife O
asked O
for O
corvina B-TARGET
and O
also O
delighted O
him, O
afternoon O
we O
shared O
a O
chocolate O
coulant.the O
second O
time O
we O
went O
with O
my O
father-in-law O
and O
also O
liked O
them, O
it O
was O
a O
domindo O
to O
eat, O
we O
picked O
jam, O
croquetas O
and O
again O
tempura O
and O
second O
black B-TARGET
rice, I-TARGET
in O
its O
point O

very O

This O
is O
twice O
the O

Miguel. O

We O
were O
there O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
and O
we O
didn’t O
like O
it. O

We O
sat O
in O
the O
passage B-TARGET
zone I-TARGET
having O
booked O
three O
weeks O
in O
advance. O

The O
tempura, B-TARGET
a O
dish O
tremendously O
vulgar O
in O
terms O
of O
its O
presentation O
and O
quality. O

Coconut B-TARGET
and O
bacon B-TARGET
are O
acceptable. O

It O
is B-TARGET
also O
vulgar. O

The O
most O
pending O
service B-TARGET
of O
a O
company O
dinner, O
therefore, O
was O
not O
good O
service. O

A O
lot O
of O
modernity, O
but O
nothing O
special. O

We O
will O
not O
return. O

I O
was O
there O
the O
other O
day O
and O
I O
looked O
good. O

The O
treatment B-TARGET
was O
cordial O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
splendid, O
they O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
good O
details O
that O
they O
like O
because O
they O
don’t O
do O
it O
at O
all. O

They O
were O
on O
top O
of O
every O
coin O
and O
didn’t O
need O
to O
call O
them. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
well O
served O
and O
well O
presented. O

I O
go O
there O
often O
and O
I O
love O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
always O
very O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good. O

From O
entrants O
we O
always O
ask O
for O
the O
tempura B-TARGET
that O
is O
good O
(despite O
the O
previous O
comments), O
croqueta B-TARGET
trufada I-TARGET
that O
is O
expectacular O
and O
the O
ravioli B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
longaniza I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Graus I-TARGET
that O
is O
expectacular O
too. O

I’ve O
tried O
several O
times, O
but O
always O
good. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
didn’t O
convince O
me O
was O
the O
duck B-TARGET
magret I-TARGET
that O
was O
soaked. O

We O
always O
drink O
cava B-TARGET
and O
we O
get O
it O
very O
cold, O
as O
it O
should O
be O
and O
in O
few O
places O
you O
get O
it O
properly. O

The O
price O
is O
good, O
nothing O
exaggerated. O

Definitely O
a O
place B-TARGET
I O
recommend. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
the O
kitchen O
of O
this O
restaurant, O
but O
the O
deal B-TARGET
leaves O
a O
lot O
to O
desire, O
yesterday, O
with O
my O
baby O
of O
4 O
months O
and O
my O
partner O
we O
tried O
to O
go O
to O
the O
tapas O
contest O
that O
is O
celebrated O
each O
year O
in O
Zaragoza O
and O
we O
were O
told O
in O
very O
bad O
ways O
that O
on O
Sunday O
only O
eat O
to O
the O
letter O
and O
that O
they O
do O
not O
do O
the O
contest O
(which O
in O
the O
propaganda O
is O
announced O
until O
November O
25), O
and O
besides O
we O
wanted O
to O
sit O
in O
a O
zone O
of O
passage, O
with O
the O
cart O
apart...finally, O
not O
to O
go O
back, O
and O
without O
trying O
it!!!!! O

I O
am O
not O
surprised O
the O
comment O
of O
Marta, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
of O
this O
local O
should O
devote O
to O
other O
men. O

Null O
education B-TARGET
and O
their O
poor O
attention B-TARGET
are O
their O
credentials. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
well, O
with O
a O
very O
nice O
“minimalist” O
decoration, B-TARGET
the O
right O
treat B-TARGET
we O
ate O
very O
well O
and O
didn’t O
seem O
expensive O
for O
the O
three O
of O
us. O

In O
short, O
very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
proper O
and O
professional O
service B-TARGET

We O
had O
dinner O
last O
Saturday O
for O
our O
2nd O
birthday. O

We O
were O
very O
agusto O
and O
dined O
very O
well, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
season, O
with O
some O
plate O
of O
card O
that O
then O
adjusted O
us O
as O
menu. O

All O
very O
correct. O

I O
think O
it’s O
a O
place B-TARGET
where O
it’s O
hard O
for O
something O
to O
go O
wrong, O
from O
these O
sites, O
which O
are O
always O
right. O

Very O
recommended. O

We O
will O
return. O

We O
were O
recently O
my O
partner O
and O
I O
eating O
and O
it O
all O
worked O
very O
well, O
both O
food, B-TARGET
wine, B-TARGET
treatment, B-TARGET
decoration... B-TARGET
we O
liked O
everything O
very O
much. O

There O
were O
small O
children O
and O
no O
problems. O

I O
was O
last O
week O
(between O
week) O
dining O
and O
it O
was O
very O
good.Both O
attention B-TARGET
(very O
attentive O
and O
giving O
appropriate O
advice), O
as O
food, B-TARGET
and O
waiting B-TARGET
time. I-TARGET

We O
didn’t O
take O
the O
dishes, O
we O
took O
the O
dishes. O

Both O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
the O
wine, B-TARGET
were O
the O
master’s B-TARGET
advice, O
and O
the O
truth O
that O
very O
right. O

We O
have O
eaten O
season B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
( O
26 O
€ O
) O
: O
All O
good, O
but O
you O
come O
out O
with O
the O
feeling O
of O
having O
paid O
more O
than O
you O
should O
(and O
that O
I O
have O
not O
paid). O

And O
the O
children's B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
a O
table O
table; O
the O
menu O
follows O
the O
logic O
of O
what O
a O
child O
can O
eat O
without O
complications O
and O
it's O
all O
good, O
but O
it O
follows O
the O
tone O
of O
the O
rest: O
expensive.There O
is O
a O
doubt O
about O
how O
it O
will O
be O
to O
eat O
on O
paper, O
but O
on O
its O
own, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
options O
available, O
I O
don't O
think O
I'll O
come O
back O
to O
check O
it O
out. O

Thank O
you O
for O
your O
advice O
Nacho... O
and O
congratulations O
on O
your O
18th O
birthday, O
be O
happy! O

In O
Zaragoza O
there O
are O
Restaurants O
correct, O
good, O
very O
good, O
Restaurants O
to O
which O
you O
do O
not O

those O
that O
go O
unnoticed, O
mediocre O
and O
miserable O
such O
as O
La B-TARGET
Scala. I-TARGET

Affirming O
that O
in O
this O
local O
you O
can O
taste O
real O
delicacies B-TARGET
is O
an O
authentic O
temerity. O

Everything O
was O
great, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
full O
and O
yet O
we O
were O
treated O
very O
well. O

We O
ate O
there O
on O
Sunday, O
May O
10. O

There O
is O
no O
better O
quality/price O
ratio O
in O
Zaragoza. O

A O
menu B-TARGET
of O
25 O
euros O
impeccable, O
the O
local O
has O
a O
relaxing O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
professional. O

The O
rogout B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
manitas I-TARGET
proves O
the O
existence O
of O
God O
the O
Father. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
we O
will O
repeat!!! O

I O
am O
sure!! O

It O
must O
have O
been, O
by O
reading O
these O
comments, O
that O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O
on O
a O
bad O
day. O

It O
is O
the O
first O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza O
in O
which O
we O
really O
didn’t O
like O
anything. O

I O
remember O
first, O
I O
ordered O
a O
tempura O
of O
vegetables O
with O
soy O
sauce. O

I O
don’t O
remember O
the O
second O
potato O
and O
dessert, B-TARGET
that’s, O
I O
don’t O
remember O
it. O

When O
I O
like O
a O
dessert, O
I O
remember O
it O
very O
well. O

The O
tempura B-TARGET
apart O
from O
not O
being O
good. O

Both O
me O
and O
other O
people O
who O
tried O
it O
didn’t O
feel O
good. O

The O
magret B-TARGET
was O
not O
fine, O
it O
had O
incredibly O
the O
duck O
pelits. O

I O
think O
that O
a O
restaurant O
that O
presents O
a O
modern, O
minimalist O
and O
quite O
snobish O
style B-TARGET
cannot O
present O
such O
a O
dish, B-TARGET
but O
of O
course O
the O
sauce O
and O
presentation O
at O
first O
glance O
covers O
it O
all. O

Very O
expensive, O
a O
want O
to O
be O
and O
not O
to O
be O
able. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
for O
anything. O

No O
noz O
did O
the O
20% O
discount O

We O
ate O
well. O

Very O
good O
risotto. B-TARGET

They O
were O
a O
bit O
slow O
in O
service. B-TARGET

The O
perfect O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
fabulous. O

Great O
windows B-TARGET
to O
enjoy O
"Les O
Rambles". O

very O
professional O
service B-TARGET
with O
the O
kitchen O
in O
sight O
and O
where O
the O
chef B-TARGET
covers O
his O
mouth O
with O
a O
mask(very O
hygienic). O

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
as O
well. O

When O
I O
brought O
the O
account, B-TARGET
they O
had O
not O
applied O
20%, O
but O
they O
told O
me O
and O
brought O
me O
the O
settled O
account. O

Wonderful O
if O
you O
go O
to O
the O
theatre. O

Good O
location, B-TARGET
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
excellent O
price O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
and O
we O
had O
to O
claim O
20%. O

The O
average O
price O
goes O
to O
20 O
with O
the O
discount. O

The O
only O
thing O
on O
the O
page O
they O
put O
that O
they O
have O
gluten-free O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
have O
no O
information O
either O
on O
the O
letter O
or O
the O
same O
waitress... B-TARGET
they O
doubted O
everything. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
with O
a O
few O
small O
details O
to O
improve. O

Fast B-TARGET
between O
plates. O

They O
should O
improve O
control O
over O
the O
cooking O
of O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
base I-TARGET
they O
use. O

Sometimes O
crude O
in O
some O
areas. O

Good O
local, B-TARGET
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
quite O
welcoming. O

Good O
quality O
price O
relationship O

It O
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
than O
what O
appears O
on O
the O
web. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
make O
the O
discount O
because O
they O
said O
that O
the O
discount O
was O
for O
full O
dinners O
not O
valid O
for O
combined O
dishes O
without O
dessert... O

In O
the O
valley B-TARGET
discount I-TARGET
does O
not O
put O
anything O
of O
this. O

Incredible O
restaurant, B-TARGET
incredible O
service, B-TARGET
wonderful O
staff B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
food. B-TARGET

100% O
recommended, O
we O
will O
go O
back. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

As O
always O
when O
we O
went, O
La O
Poma B-TARGET
gets O
a O
10 O
in O
quality/price O
ratio. O

On O
this O
25/12 O
day, O
we O
appreciated O
more O
slowness O
in O
the O
service B-TARGET
because O
there O
was O
less O
staff O
on O
such O
a O
marked O
day, O
otherwise O
excellent O
quality/price O
ratio. O

All O
very O
rich O
Excellent O

My O
opinion O
about O
the O
La B-TARGET
Pomme I-TARGET
restaurant O
is O
that O
it O
is O
correct, O
but O
not O
extraordinary. O

We O
ordered O
a O
risotto B-TARGET
(acceptable) O
and O
a O
pizza B-TARGET
(very O
improved) O
and O
desserts B-TARGET
(the O
best). O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
efficient O
but O
not O
friendly. O

They O
made O
a O
mistake O
in O
bringing O
one O
of O
the O
plates O
and O
rectified O
it, O
but O
they O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
little. O

In O
the O
account O
they O
forgot O
to O
make O
the O
discount O
and O
it O
was O
also O
necessary O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
correction. O

The O
decoration B-TARGET
was O
quite O
successful. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
full O
of O
tourists. O

Excellent O
home O
food B-TARGET
that O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
mother's O
food.they O
have O
made O
a O
great O
reform B-TARGET
to O
satisfy O
their O
customers O

I O
recommend O
it, O
a O
place O
to O
enjoy O
homemade O
food B-TARGET
or O
also O
a O
good O
bulldozer B-TARGET
to O
the O
stone O
within O
affordable O
prices, O
for O
those O
who O
like O
good O
wines, B-TARGET
you O
have O
a O
great O
variety O
of O
them O
with O
which O
to O
accompany O
a O
good O
meal, O
as O
for O
the O
people O
who O
serve O
it, O
Ana B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
owner I-TARGET
is O
responsible O
for O
making O
your O
stay O
comfortable O
and O
her O
mother B-TARGET
in O
the O
kitchen O
an O
excellent O
cook O
and O
a O
woman's O
charm. O

We O
ate O
the O
menu B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
brasa I-TARGET
price O
quality O
well, O
the O
cayos B-TARGET
we O
tried O
out O
of O
10. O

We O
will O
recommend. O

Good O
place B-TARGET
to O
repeat. O

We O
ate O
on O
Sunday O
20 O
October O
and O
we O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
great, O
we O
tried O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
beautiful I-TARGET
scabies I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
house I-TARGET
very O
good, O
the O
meats B-TARGET
very O
well O
prepared, O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
almost O
exceeded, O
but O
there O
was O
an O
effort O
that O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
enough O
wines B-TARGET
to O
be O
able O
to O
choose. O

Very O
recommended O
and O
to O
come O
back!!! O

We O
had O
to O
wait O
a O
while O
to O
sit O
down, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
it O
was O
worth O
it. O

Excellent O
attention B-TARGET
of O
all O
the O
staff, O
the O
food B-TARGET
or O
talk O
all O
very O
good O
above O
all O
the O
snack B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
breeze I-TARGET
uff O
still O
taste O
it, O
very O
good O
amount O
for O
the O
one O
who O
is O
snack, O
a O
little O
apart O
from O
the O
center, O
but O
otherwise O
the O
tasty O
makes O
forget O
the O
apart, O
really O
is O
very O
good, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
those O
of O
good O
palate. O

We O
were O
7 O
people O
with O
a O
child O
so O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
with O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

We O
were O
a O
large O
group, O
20 O
people, O
and O
we O
were O
treated O
phenomenally O
and O
very O
effective. O

The O
salad, B-TARGET
the O
fried B-TARGET
ingredients, I-TARGET
the O
cheese, B-TARGET
phenomenal. O

As O
a O
2nd O
dish O
I O
chose O
barbecue, B-TARGET
which O
was O
sensational, O
and O
with O
homemade B-TARGET
fried I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
(not O
frozen). O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
are O
also O
very O
good, O
some O
snacks O
at O
the O
end, O
coffee O
and O
all O
for O
20 O
€ O
per O
person. O

The O
comments O
were O
favorable O
to O
everything O
except O
wine. B-TARGET

Hard O
wine O
from O
hard O
land. O

There O
are O
very O
good O
young O
wines B-TARGET
from O
Cariñena O
for O
less O
than O
2 O
€ O
the O
bottle. O

The O
only O
point O
of O
improvement. O

thank O
you! O

Today O
we O
ate O
the O
brasa O
menu O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

It O
won’t O
be O
the O
last O
time O
we’re O
going O
because O
we O
loved O
it. O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
great O
dinner B-TARGET
as O
well. O

Definitely O
recommended. O

A O
week O
ago O
we O
went O
for O
the O
first O
time O
to O
Candelas, O
it O
was O
his O
brasa B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
we O
tried O
and O
except O
for O
the O
wine B-TARGET
that O
I O
gained O
a O
lot O
by O
turning O
it O
into O
summer O
tinto, O
the O
dinner O
was O
satisfactory. O

We O
knew O
his O
summer O
offer O
and O
we O
said O
we O
would O
come O
back. O

Today O
in O
the O
meal O
two O
comensals O
have O
tried O
this O
menu O
and O
a O
third O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day.we O
have O
all O
stayed. O

Very O
pleased, O
very O
good O
price. O

We O
will O
repeat. O

Excellent O
and O
highly O
recommended O
treatment B-TARGET
by O
the O
head O
of O
the O
room. O

Back O
in O
the O
holidays O
and O
it O
seems O
appropriate O
to O
go O
back O
where O
we O
ended O
up, O
if O
the O
last O
was O
a O
good O
experience.Excellent O
option O
both O

above O
all O

summer B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
rice. I-TARGET

Today O
is O
the O
second O
time O
we’ve O
tried O
it O
and O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
three O
arroces B-TARGET
served, O
the O
black, B-TARGET
the O
callos B-TARGET
and O
the O
new O
reboot. B-TARGET

It O
magnifies O
Ana’s B-TARGET
attention O
and O
today O
the O
cane O
was O
a O
cane O
of O
rum, O
as O
it O
should O
be, O
the O
work O
of O
a O
good O
waitress. B-TARGET

I O
hope O
you O
do O
not O
forget O
with O
the O
end O
of O
the O
summer, O
a O
very O
tight O
and O
tasty O
menu. B-TARGET

In O
any O
case, O
it O
was O
a O
good O
return O
to O
the O
routine O
and O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
course. O

Excellent O
work B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET

at O
a O
very O
interesting O
price. O

Exquisite O
taste, B-TARGET
tasty O
food, B-TARGET
in O
an O
atmosphere B-TARGET
without O
luxury O
but O
with O
a O
quality O
price O

almost O
impossible O
to O
find O
in O

The O
attention B-TARGET
has O
been O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
acceptable, O
but O
my O
complaint O
is O
with O
the O
reservation, B-TARGET
on O
the O
internet, O
otherwise O
I O
would O
have O
personally O
presented O
would O
have O
had O
a O

Everything O

busy!! O

They O

me O
hollow O

the O

Food, B-TARGET
very O
good. O

Friendly O
service O
and O
fast O

The O

little O
above O

Good O

We O
will O

I O
liked O
it. O

I O
didn’t O
know O
it, O
but O
the O
quality-price O
ratio O
was O
very O
good. O

Because O
of O
the O
excessive O
noise, B-TARGET
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
and O
in O
the O
room O
it O
resounded O
a O

we O
could O
hardly O

Good O

good O
food B-TARGET

Hi, O
we O
went O
yesterday O
12-08-2011, O
and O
really O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
exquisite. O

I O
loved O
it. O

Honestly, O
nice, O
especially O
the O
solomillo B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
fine O
red O
wine, O
the O
best O
I O
have O
tried O
and O
very O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

This O
is O
my O
favourite O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Barcelona. O

Never O
to O
disappoint. O

The O
prices O
are O
a O
bit O
high, O
but O
compensate O
with O
the O
good O
quality O
of O
the O
product B-TARGET
and O
the O
professionalism O
of O
the O
entire O
staff. B-TARGET

Perfect O
and O
maximum O
comfort. O

It O
has O
caused O
me O
a O
great O
impression, O
both O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
your O
products B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
exquisite O
treatment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
your I-TARGET
staff. I-TARGET

I O
will O
repeat O
it O
when O
I O
return O
to O
Barcelona O
and O
I O
have O
already O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
friends. O

Very O
good O
quality O
and O
service. B-TARGET

A O
good O
restaurant B-TARGET
within O
the O
middle/high O
range O
of O
Barcelona O

A O
very O
quiet O
and O
perfect O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
special O
occasions O
with O
the O
family, O
etc... O

A O
wide O
list B-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
variety. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
attentive O
and O
fast, O
without O
being O
overwhelming O
at O
any O
time. O

to O
recommend. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
price, O
in O
addition O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
together O
and O
you O
hear O
unwillingly O
all O
the O
conversations O
around. O

I O
will O
definitely O
not O
come O
back, O
at O
least O
by O
paying O
for O
it. O

It O
can O
be O
summed O
up O
in O
one O
word: O
great. O

Very O
good O
quality O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
well O
cooked. O

Very O
fast O
service, B-TARGET
very O
friendly. O

I O
don’t O
give O
it O
a O
10 O
because O
it’s O
a O
bit O
expensive O
but O
it’s O
worth O
it. O

It O
should O
always O
be O
a O
reference. O

We O
went O
for O
a O
reconsideration O
and O
it O
was O
all O
right. O

The O
croquettes B-TARGET
and O
croquettes B-TARGET
are O
a O
delight. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
guests, B-TARGET
especially O
if O
they O
are O
invited. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
environment. B-TARGET

I O
give O
you O
8.5 O

We O
always O
go O
when O
we O
don’t O
know O
where O
to O
go O
for O
dinner, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
price O
in O
comparison O
is O
worth O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
treat O
are O
undoubtedly O
one O
of O
the O
best O
at O
BCN, O
and O
that O
I O
have O
tried O
many O
restaurants. O

Something O
you O
can O
improve? O

Cutting B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
jamon I-TARGET
in O
thinner O
slices! O

Impecable, O
extraordinary O
quality O
in O
terms O
of O
product, B-TARGET
presentation O
and O
“point”. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
bright, O
impeccable, O
elegant. O

No O
one O
catches. O

As O
always, O
L'Olivé O
is O
a O
safe O
value. O

Catalan O
and O
market O
cuisine, O
based O
on O
an O
optimal O
quality O
of O
the O
product. B-TARGET

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
enjoys O
an O
enviable O
homogeneity. O

It O
will O
never O
disappoint O
them. O

It O
is O
always O
of O
unbeatable O
excellence. O

The O
environment, B-TARGET
the O
food, B-TARGET
the O
excellent O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
excellent O
quality/price O
ratio. O

Very O
expensive O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
they O
offer, O
I O
have O
eaten O
equally O
or O
better O
at O
La O
Flauta, O
El O
Asador O
de O
Aranda, O
etc. O

for O
much O
less. O

It’s O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
I’m O
not O
going O
to O
go O
back O
to. O

Nothing O
to O
object O
to O
the O
food, B-TARGET
nor O
to O
the O
decoration, B-TARGET
but O
I O
want O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
at O
the O
height O
of O
what O
the O
restaurant O
would O
deserve. O

The O
best O
of O
Barcelona. O

Everything O
is O
excellent. O

The O
price O
is O
high O
but O
it O
is O
worth O
it. O

The O
local B-TARGET
very O
well, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
but O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
dishes, O
as O
it O
pays, O
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

Another O
bad O
taste O
detail O
is O
that O
the O
entertainment B-TARGET
they O
put O
in O
the O
beginning O
pays O
you. O

As O
always, O
L'Olivé O
offers O
a O
Catalan O
and O
market O
cuisine B-TARGET
of O
impeccable O
quality. O

The O
product B-TARGET
is O
always O
first O
and O
of O
envious O
homogeneity. O

Their O
selection O
of O
"to O
picar" O
is O
remarkable: O
great O
Roman B-TARGET
calamares I-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
fresh O
and O
shaped O
boquerones. B-TARGET

Fish B-TARGET
impeccable O
and O
of O
a O
cooking, O
either O
to O
the O
plate O
or O
to O
the O
oven, O
always O
at O
its O
point. O

Desserts B-TARGET
for O
gourmets, O
highlighting O
one O
of O
the O
best O
"Catalan B-TARGET
creams" I-TARGET
and O
a O
"tiramisú" B-TARGET
of O
anthology. O

The O
cellar B-TARGET
is O
sufficient O
and O
with O
a O
very O
well O
chosen O
variety O
and O
at O
suitable O
prices. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
pleasant O
and O
noisy. O

It’s O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
repeat, O
repeat O
and O
repeat. O

It O
is O
excellent! O

Rich O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
or O
very O
good, O
the O
price O
is O
carillo O
but O
normal O
in O
this O
area O
of O
Barcelona, O
now O
the O
service O
is O
very O
improved O
especially O
that O
you O
do O
not O
touch O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
of O
the O
rush O
that O
wants O
you O
to O
go O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
tight O
and O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
noise. O

and O
passable. O

and O
well. O

Good O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
even O
though O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
speeding O
up O
as O
if O
they O
were O
extinguishing O
a O
fireplace. O

They O
are O
actually O
trying O
to O
get O
you O
out O
of O
the O
table O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
to O
take O
a O
second O
turn. O

It’s O
not O
a O
hole O
in O
terms O
of O
price. O

We O
loved O
it, O
we O
brought O
clients O
to O
work, O
and O
we O
ate O
dinner O
with O
weekends O
alone... O
until O
recently O
we O
came O
back O
with O
some O
friends O
and... O
what O
a O
disappointment!!! O

Treat B-TARGET
poor, O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
don’t O
make O
sense O
and O
the O
local B-TARGET
has O
a O
lot O
of O
noise! O

The O
service B-TARGET
stopped O
wishing O
and O
sincerely O
told O
you O
that O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
spent O
its O
best O
time. O

It O
is O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
you O
get. O

I O
had O
very O
high O
expectations O
after O
being O
in O
the O
Barcelonta O
of O
the O
same O
group, O
but O
it O
disappointed O
me O
very O
much: O
heated O
food, B-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
noise, B-TARGET
very O
close O
tables, B-TARGET
cold O
and O
unpleasant O
treatment... B-TARGET

I O
am O
not O
going O
back. O

My O
favorite O
for O
special O
celebrations O
for O
many O
years. O

I O
have O
trusted O
him O
since O
I O
was O
in O
the O
C/Muntaner. O

I O
never O
failed!! O

Acceptable O
food O
at O
a O
somewhat O
high O
price O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
lacks O
a O
renovation, O
it O
has O
remained O
something O
outdated O
in O
all O
respects. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
nice; O
the O
food B-TARGET
good O
but O
a O
bit O
expensive; O
the O
service B-TARGET
treated O
us O
fatal O
(February O
2007); O
noisy, O
impertinent, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
enjoy O
the O
dinner. O

Undoubtedly, O
the O
worst O
thing O
about O
the O
restaurant O
is O
the O
decoration, B-TARGET
strangely O
praised O
by O
some. O

The O
minimalist? O

Impersonal, O
the O
worst O
thing O
that O
can O
happen O
to O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
that O
wants O
to O
have O
its O
own O
voice. O

For O
the O
rest, O
the O
good O
service B-TARGET
within O
that O
as O
said O
a O
pepper O
politician O
(Cañete) O
the O
"new" O
waiters O
do O
not O
differentiate O
a O
rice O
from O
a O
fideo... O
but O
at O
least O
they O
are O
effective O
and O
attentive. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
good O
in O
quality O
and O
quantity. O

No O
extraordinary O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
expected, O
but O
they O
are O
mostly O
very O
good O
(which O
is O
not O
a O
little). O

You O
need O
to O
improve O
your O
wine B-TARGET
list. I-TARGET

Total; O
good O
food, B-TARGET
with O
little O
surprise O
capacity O
and O
quite O
expensive. O

They O
have O
repeated O
it O
in O
various O
opinions: O
the O
noise B-TARGET
is O
insufficient!! O

I O
liked O
the O
beetle O
filet B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
foie, O
generally O
I O
give O
it O
a O
score O
of O
9. O

The O
list B-TARGET
that O
comes O
out O
on O
the O
internet O
should O
be O
more O
extensive. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
were O
there O
to O
celebrate O
his O
birthday. O

The O
truth O
is, O
we O
had O
a O
great O
time. O

The O
food B-TARGET
very O
but O
very O
good, O
I O
still O
remember O
the O
foie B-TARGET
and O
duck O
mango B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
strawberry I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

I O
was O
delighted. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
in O
a O
hurry, O
but O
it O
has O
been O
good O
for O
us, O
because O
after O
dinner O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
theater, O
and O
yet O
we O
left O
the O
restaurant O
running. O

They O
do O
not O
care O
for O
the O
client; O
noises, O
a O
scandal, O
has O
lost O
all O
its O
charm. O

Food B-TARGET

Good O

excellent O

and O
attractive O
decoration. B-TARGET

and O
outstanding. O

I O
don't O
understand O
how O
many O
comments O
catalog O
it O
expensive. O

We O
are O
talking O
about O
a O
very O
fine O
site B-TARGET
located O
in O
the O
barcelona O
cognac, O
therefore, O
I O
understand, O
that O
has O
to O
be O
reflected O
in O
the O
price. O

Excellent O
quality, O
extensive O
letter, B-TARGET
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
very O
careful O
facilities B-TARGET
and O
private O
salons O
that O
praise O
everything O
said. O

Ultimately, O
they O
do O
not O
lose O
it. O

and O
just. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
what O
they O
give O
is O
expensive. O

The O
place O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
environment B-TARGET
is O
noisy. O

Ideal O
for O
guiris O
or O
business O
but O
I O
would O
never O
go O
with O
my O
girlfriend O
or O
my O
friends. O

I O
am O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
attendant O
when O
there O
are O
business O
or O
family O
celebrations. O

The O
quality/price O
ratio O
is O
excellent O
considering O
what’s O
around. O

Very O
recommended. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
good, O
but O
for O
my O
taste O
the O
price O
is O
excessive O
in O
relation O
quality O
price. O

I O
had O
recommended O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
worth O
trying. O

Very O
good O
treatment B-TARGET
by O
all O
staff O
(correct, O
educated O
and O
professional), O
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
a O
relaxed O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
dining O
room. O

Simply O
put, O
I O
am O
delighted! O

I O
recommend O
it!! O

I O
recommend O
it, O
it O
is O
very O
good O

excellent O
price O
that O
is O
the O
important O
thing, O
good O
cellar. B-TARGET

impeccable. O

Kitchen, B-TARGET

and O
especially O
the O
extraordinary, O
and O
very O
professional O
staff. B-TARGET

I O
feel O
deceived! O

I O
made O
my O
reservation O
by O
calling, O
if O
at O
22:00 O
and O
they O
comment O
that O
the O
show O
begins O
at O
23:30. O

Perfectly O
clear O
on O
a O
poster O
at O
the O
entrance O
at O
23:30 O
on O
Saturday O
“Las O
Posesas”. O

We O
dined O
my O
lady O
and O
I O
properly O
served B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
too O
without O
being O
anything O
out O
of O
the O
usual, O
the O
sorbets B-TARGET
were O
mediocre O
not O
to O
say O
that O
they O
were O
not O
at O
the O
height O
of O
what O
was O
paid, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
wrong O
until O
here O
all O
right, O
about O
the O
twelve O
and O
fourth O
appear O
“Las O
Posesas”They O
start O
to O
take O
photos O
with O
some O
customer O
and O
turn O
around O
the O
local. O

At O
one O
time O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
already O
asleep O
waiting O
for O
the O
promised O
show O
and O
we O
went, O
before O
I O
went, O
I O
commented O
to O
a O
bar B-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
and O
no O
longer O
answered O
me O
as O
at O
first O
with O
good O
words O
and O
education O
now O
he O
tells O
me O
that O
it O
is O
not O
his O
problem O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
fault O
that O
the O
show O
indicated O
at O
23:30 O
was O
the O
one O
and O
had O
not O
started. O

Possessed O
I O
feel O
deceived O
book O
a O
dinner O
with O
show O
and O
I O
went O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
later O
without O
seeing O
the O
show, O
pay O
66€ O
for O
the O
dinner O
of O
two O
I O
could O
have O
gone O
to O
any O
other O
restaurant O
that O
for O
that O
amount O
had O
dinner O
equal O
or O
better O
and O
they O
deceived O
me O
I O
no O
performance. O

You O
are O
valued O

We O
ate O
dinner O
and O
had O
a O
really O
good O
time. O

They B-TARGET
acted O
as O
Posesas O
and O
did O
a O
very O
entertaining O
and O
fun O
show B-TARGET
both O
on O
stage O
and O
when O
they O
are O
with O
people O
taking O
pictures O
are O
very O
nice. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
we O
are O
grateful O
that O
the O
performance B-TARGET
starts O
when O
we’ve O
finished O
dinner. O

Then O
we O
went O
more O
times. O

I O
was O
with O
a O
friend O
this O
past O
Friday, O
I O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
her O
because O
I O
had O
already O
been O
there O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
a O
different O
place, B-TARGET
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
dine, O
have O
a O
fun O
time, O
take O
some O
drink O
and O
dinner O
something, O
well, O
total O
disappointment, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant, O
once O
more O
innovative, O
now O
has O
become O
a O
restaurant O
more. O

We O
ate O
dinner O
at O
the O
card, O
the O
delicious O
tartar B-TARGET
stick, I-TARGET
the O
meat; B-TARGET
for O
the O
hard O
price, O
the O
very O
good O
attention, B-TARGET
the O
dessert, B-TARGET
a O
very O
good O
tasting, O
ultimately O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
very O
very O
expensive O
for O
what O
we O
ate O
dinner, O
we O
went O
out O
at O
60 O
€ O
per O
head. O

An O
excess O
of O
truth. O

I O
am O
not O
going O
back O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

They O
serve O
delicious O
dishes, B-TARGET
whether O
new O
or O
traditional. O

The O
maître O
recommended O
two O
wines, B-TARGET
one O
red O
and O
one O
white, O
which O
were O
a O
good O
result. O

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
service, B-TARGET
quick O
and O
attentive. O

When O
serving O
the O
dishes, O
the O
local O
manager B-TARGET
gives O
brief O
and O
relevant O
explanations O
that O
are O
appreciated. O

With O
so O
many O
virtues O
I O
was O
waiting O
for O
a O
cane O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
family O
dinner O
we O
celebrated O
there. O

But O
it O
was O
not O
so. O

A O
total O
of O
190 O
euros O
for O
6 O
people. O

A O
reasonable O
price, O
in O
my O
opinion. O

Very O
recommended. O

We O
will O
return. O

<->it O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
or O
a O
cafe O
of O
Mediterranean O
cuisine, O
it O
is O
a O
"place" O
where O
they O
have O
a O
mini O
card B-TARGET
of O
tapas, B-TARGET
served O
in O
a O
bowl O
in O
which O
you O
can O
hardly O
use O
as O
a O
dish, O
with O
an O
average O
quality O
of O
the O
same, O
and O
that O
to O
survive O
offer O
a O
menu O
of O
nine O
euros, O
A O
BON O
ENTENDER O
POCAS O
PALABRAS O
BASTAN. O

<+ O
> O
Nothing O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
except O
the O
tiramisú, B-TARGET
which O
to O
my O
taste, O
was O
bitter. O

The O
kindness O
we O
were O
treated O
with O
was O
excellent. O

The O
preparation O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
the O
menu O
of O
20€, O
exceptional. O

They O
strive O
to O
do O
it O
well O

<->The O
menu B-TARGET
reserved O
pot O
Internet, O
was O
not, O
eñ O
air O
no O
funcionabs, O
a O
lot O
of O
heat, O
the O
treatment O
of O
the O
commissioner B-TARGET
not O
correct O
and O
the O
food, B-TARGET
not O
good, O
nor O
in O
quantity. O

<+>The O
Catalan O
camaraderie O
who O
attended O
us. O

The O
restaurant, O
phenomenal, O
both O
the O
food B-TARGET
with O
service. B-TARGET

The O
point O
is O
that O
the O
40% O
offer O
on O
the O
letter O
was O
not O
so. O

The O
discount O
does O
not O
apply O
to O
tapas O
(also O
on O
the O
card), O
or O
desserts O
(also O
on O
the O
card) O
or O
drinks O
(this O
is O
normal). O

So O
the O
discount O
is O
basically O
on O
second O
dishes O
and O
salads O
(few O
on O
the O
menu). O

For O
6 O
people, O
pediomos O
3 O
tapas, O
1 O
salad, O
6 O
seconds O
and O
3 O
desserts O
plus O
drinks. O

The O
price O
is O
28€ O
per O
person O
(including O
the O
discount O
in O
the O
seconds). O

If O
no O
discount O
is O
applied O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
expensive. O

And O
although O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
well O
worth O
it O
(as O
well O
as O
the O
service), B-TARGET
the O
surroundings, B-TARGET
local B-TARGET
and O
terrace, B-TARGET
could O
be O
better. O

Quality O
and O
price O
very O
reasonable, O
having O
30% O
on O
the O
menu O
(only O
meals). O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
enough. O

Nor O
did O
we O
ask O
for O
anything O
special, O
a O
rice, B-TARGET
which O
was O
at O
its O
point O
and O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
the O
fish B-TARGET
was O
of O
quality. O

The O
cava B-TARGET
blood I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

It O
is O
recommended O
in O
place. O

Good O
quality O
and O
correct O
quantity. O

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
quick O
and O
friendly. O

and O
pleasant. O

Very O
good O
attention. B-TARGET

Gonzalo, O
the O
chef, O
is O
responsible O
for O
creating O
a O
very O
friendly O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

The O
quality-price O
ratio O
is O
very O
good. O

and O
good O

Excellent O

Small O
Local B-TARGET

I O
didn’t O
like O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
place. B-TARGET

I O
am O
so O
grateful O
to O
see O
the O
Cafe B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
House I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Letters. I-TARGET

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
unique, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
attentive O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
a O
10. O

They O
offered O
us O
fresh O
eggs B-TARGET
from O
their O
chickens O
and O
they O
were O
exquisite. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
eat O
on O
the O
terrace, O
or O
for O
breakfast. O

I O
advise O

Just O
a O
Criticism O
(Constructive) O

In O
the O
environment B-TARGET
all O
very O
correct, O
decoration, O
music, O
environment, O
etc. O

Except O
for O
the O
ambientator B-TARGET
used O
in O
the O
local O

Too O
strong, O
almost O
offensive O

Destroy O
the O
good O
food B-TARGET
served O
carefully... O
to O
improve O
this O
point. O

I’ve O
been O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
clients O
and O
I O
love O
them. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
exquisite O
especially O
the O
broken B-TARGET
eggs I-TARGET
that O
by O
the O
way O
explained O
to O
me O
that O
they O
are O
from O
their O
farm/masia. O

The O
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

They O
also O
have O
private O
dining O
rooms O
for O
groups. O

Keep O
it O
in O
mind O
for O
the O
next O
time. O

I O
recommend O
it!! O

A O
quiet O
place B-TARGET
with O
few O
tables. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
of O
great O
quality O
but O
is O
in O
line O
with O
the O
price. O

Especially O
interesting O
with O
the O
30% O
discount. O

Very O
quiet O
environment, B-TARGET
very O
clean, O
the O
dishes O
were O
missing O
a O
little O
more O
food, B-TARGET
for O
the O
high O
prices O
it O
has, O
but O
ultimately O
everything O
very O
correct, O
curious O
decoration B-TARGET

We O
arrived O
at O
22.30 O
at O
the O
time O
we O
had O
the O
reservation, O
and O
the O
only O
person O
there O
was O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
a O
Pakistani O
who O
barely O
spoke O
Spanish, O
told O
us O
that O
our O
reservation O
was O
at O
21.30. O

When O
we O
insisted O
it O
was O
safe O
at O
22.30, O
I O
hid O
it O
by O
looking O
at O
the O
reservation O
papers, O
and O
we O
saw O
how O
they O
had O
our O
reservation O
sheet O
printed. O

My O
husband O
started O
reading O
our O
data, O
where O
the O
clear O
hour O
actually O
appeared. O

He O
quickly O
changed O
the O
sheet, O
and O
wanted O
us O
to O
believe O
that O
we O
had O
been O
confused O
with O
another O
table O
they O
had O
at O
20.30. O

Lie O
everything, O
they O
should O
have O
the O
desire O
to O
close O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
stay O
for O
a O
table O
of O
two O
who O
came O
on O
top O
with O
a O
30% O
and O
lied O
to O
us O
scornfully. O

So O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
dinner O
elsewhere, O
and O
at O
times O
I O
call O
us O
the O
same O
gentleman O
saying O
that O
if O
we O
came O
back O
we O
would O
invite, O
we O
deduce O
that O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
making O
him O
bad O
advertising. O

Obviously O
we O
will O
not O
come O
back O
or O
believe O
anything O
of O
that O
invitation. O

A O
shame O
on O
everything. O

We O
were O
advised O
the O
dish B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
discount O
on O
online O
booking O
was O
respected. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
welcoming O
location. B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
pleasure O
that O
you O
can O
eat O
at O
16:00 O
so O
quietly O
and O
so O
tastefully. O

Very O
attentive O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
we O
chose O
seemed O
very O
suitable. O

Good O
cooking B-TARGET
and O
good O
treat, B-TARGET
we O
will O
repeat!!! O

Good O
price, O
friendly O
service B-TARGET

Restaurant B-TARGET
small O
and O
very O
cozy, O
very O
quiet, O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
and O
presentation B-TARGET
in O
accordance O
with O
what O
was O
expected. O

I O
recommend O
the O
paella B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
seafood I-TARGET
and O
sangria B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
cava. I-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
back. O

Very O
good O
service; B-TARGET
the O
local B-TARGET
is O
greatly O
equipped, O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
find O
in O
addition; O
in O
the O
reservation O
we O
asked O
for O
the O
most O
remote O
table, O
so O
to O
go O
with O
a O
child, O
and O
we O
were O
granted O
it O
without O
a O
problem O
(and O
the O
local O
is O
small). O

The O
San B-TARGET
Valentino I-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
great, O
beautiful, O
varied, O
and O
with O
food B-TARGET
of O
great O
quality, O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
served O
us O
great, O
cheerful, O
kind, O
sympathetic O
and O
attentive. O

As O
for O
the O
price, O
I O
can’t O
complain O
about O
the O
price. O

Totally O
recommended!! O

A O
well-decorated O
restaurant, B-TARGET
but O
with O
small O
spaces. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
attentive. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
but O
without O
throwing O
rockets. O

The O
rations B-TARGET
were O
quite O
scarce. O

Some O
of O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
not O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
money O
paid. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great. O

We O
went O
on O
a O
very O
quiet O
night, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
tables, O
I O
imagine O
that O
influenced O
the O
service O
but O
still O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Very O
original O
local, B-TARGET
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
service. B-TARGET

The O
truth O
is O
that O
this O
restaurant O
has O
surprised O
us O
by O
the O
quality-price O
relationship, O
it O
is O
not O
cheap, O
but O
everything O
is O
good O
and O
in O
sufficient O
quantities, O
we O
have O
delighted O
both O
my O
husband O
and O
me. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
are O
fine O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
slow. O

We O
entered O
at O
10 O
p.m. O
and O
left O
at O
12:45 O
p.m. O
and O
did O
not O
have O
any O
desserts O
or O
drinks. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
pleasant O
environment. B-TARGET

The O
lighting B-TARGET
is O
small, O
but O
welcoming. O

A O
bit O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
is, O
but O
well, O
being O
in O
the O
born O
you O
already O
know... O

I O
will O
be O
back O
safe. O

Nice, O
comfortable O
and O
modern, O
with O
a O
careful O
and O
good O
quality O
kitchen. B-TARGET

and O
regular. O

Good O
decoration, B-TARGET
normal O
food, B-TARGET
a O
lot O
of O
noise B-TARGET
and O
something O
expensive. O

2 O
entrances O
and O
2 O
seconds, O
with O
wine O
20 O
€, O
without O
dessert O
or O
water, O
110 O
€. O

It’s O
fine, O
but O
I O
think O
they O
work O
for O
punctual O
customers, O
and O
I O
won’t O
repeat O
it. O

By O
the O
way, O
paying O
almost O
5€ O
x O
the O
covered O
always O
annoys O
me. O

I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
restaurant; B-TARGET
we O
were O
treated O
in O
a O
casual O
but O
professional O
way; O
the O
food, B-TARGET
all O
the O
dishes O
quality O
excellent O
and O
tasty; O
I O
will O
be O
back O
soon! O

A O
good O
environment, B-TARGET
exquisite O
and O
attentive O
service, B-TARGET
professional, O
quality O
dishes, B-TARGET
well O
cooked O
and O
correct O
rations. B-TARGET

You O
don’t O
care O
to O
pay O
for O
being O
well O
served O
and O
eating O
well. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
environment. B-TARGET

We O
all O
liked O
the O
food. B-TARGET

A O
hair O
more O
expensive O
than O
we O
expected. O

Very O
pleasant O
and O
animated O
environment. B-TARGET

is O
recommended. O

It O
was O
our O
first O
visit O
to O
Kafka B-TARGET
and O
I’m O
sure O
you’ll O
repeat O
it O
on O
our O
next O
escapades O
to O
Barcelona. O

Nice O
environment, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
dishes. B-TARGET

Everything O
we O
tried O
we O
loved. O

Fries B-TARGET
have O
a O
well-deserved O
reputation. O

Very O
recommended. O

Really O
100% O
recommended O

Interesting O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
Born, O
great O
quality O
in O
the O
product B-TARGET
used, O
the O
only O
one O
but O
it O
would O
be O
that O
the O
room B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
and O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
a O
little O
close O
to O
each O
other. O

Nothing O
has O
changed, O
good O
if O
for O
better O
with O
the O
new O
Asian O
style O
dishes, O
after O
a O
long O
time O
without O
returning, O
for O
work O
reasons, O
I O
still O
think O
that O
it O
is O
the O
best O
of O
Barcelona, O
great O
food, B-TARGET
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
we O
were O
4 O
hours O
very O
well O
spent, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
you O
and O
I O
hope O
to O
come O
back O
soon. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it! O

Attentive O
and O
efficient O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
great O
meal B-TARGET
and O
with O
very O
good O
quality O
price. O

It O
met O
our O
expectations. O

Per O
you O
could O
improve O
the O
distribution B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tables, I-TARGET
as O
some O
of O
them O
are O
too O
together, O
and O
others O
are O
very O
close O
to O
the O
bar, O
and O
therefore, O
people O
are O
continuously O
passing O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
beginners. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
and O
the O
exceptional O
decor B-TARGET
so O
somo O
the O
service B-TARGET
that O
was O
very O
friendly O
at O
all O
times. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
quality-price O
ratio O
seems O
to O
me O
bad O
as O
the O
food B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
not O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
price. O

Nice O
place, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
dishes B-TARGET
with O
average-high O
note O
and O
with O
a O
good O
quality-price O
ratio. O

is O
recommended. O

Careful O
and O
efficient O
service, B-TARGET
pleasant O
environment. B-TARGET

Friendly O
environment, O
not O
recommended O
for O
business. O

Prices O
are O
normal, O
right O
nowadays. O

Tasting B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
: O
a O
little O
more O
abundant, O
but O
well O
cooked. O

Only O
critical O
comments: O
scarce O
light B-TARGET
for O
a O
restaurant; O
here O
the O
decoration O
prevails O
over O
the O
function. O

It O
is O
also O
not O
advisable O
to O
mix O
too O
many O
customers O
who O
drink O
drinks O
with O
the O
beginners. O

In O
other O
words, O
very O
recommended. O

Excellent O
quality-price O
ratio O
in O
the O
lunch B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
in O
a O
chic O
local B-TARGET
very O
well O
ambiented. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
description O
that O
restaurants O
made O
of O
Kafka O
was O
very O
accurate. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
attentive O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good. O

Absolutely O
recommended. O

Very O
suitable O
for O
food B-TARGET
and O
environment. I-TARGET

A O
warm O
and O
pleasant O
environment. B-TARGET

Friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
cuisine. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

We O
had O
dinner O
for O
three O
people O
and O
we O
liked O
it O
very O
much. O

Good O
environment, B-TARGET
very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
food. B-TARGET

The O
room B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
decorated O
and O
very O
welcoming. O

A O
place B-TARGET
that O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
at O
home. O

Excellent O
food, B-TARGET
excellent O
product B-TARGET
and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

If O
I O
have O
to O
find O
a O
piece, O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
together. O

Nice O
to O
drink O
drinks, B-TARGET
cocktails B-TARGET
and O
a O
wine B-TARGET
drink. I-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it, O
don’t O
leave O
you O
indifferent. O

To O
begin O
with, O
the O
plate B-TARGET
and O
the O
serviette B-TARGET
had O
black O
carbonilla. O

We O
ordered O
some O
croquettes O
and O
a O
changet O
first, O
we O
were O
2 O
people. O

The O
changet B-TARGET
was O
salmuera. O

Secondly O
we O
ordered O
a O
black O
rice O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
sauce O
allyoli O
to O
accompany. O

The O
croquettes O
literally O
threw O
them O
on O
the O
table O
without O
even O
telling O
the O
waitress, B-TARGET
because O
by O
the O
door O
was O
entering O
a O
friend O
of O
his O
with O
whom O
he O
sat O
down O
to O
talk. O

When O
the O
rice O
arrived, O
I O
reminded O
him O
of O
the O
sauce O
and O
he O
was O
not O
worthy O
to O
answer O
me. O

I O
began O
to O
eat, O
so O
that O
the O
ration B-TARGET
would O
not O
be O
cold, O
but O
rather O
scarce, O
and, O
surprisingly, O
it O
was O
also O
a O
salmon O
flooded O
in O
ink. O

For O
the O
third O
time O
I O
ask O
for O
the O
sauce O
and O
then O
it O
is O
worthy O
to O
answer O
me O
that O
they O
do O
not O
have O
it O
and O
they O
must O
do O
it O
at O
the O
moment, O
to O
which O
I O
answer O
that O
I O
could O
have O
explained O
it O
from O
the O
beginning O
and O
I O
would O
have O
decided O
if O
I O
chose O
the O
dish O
or O
not O
because O
once O
eaten O
it O
no O
longer O
made O
sense O
to O
wear O
it. O

At O
that O
moment O
he O
realized O
his O
negligent O
behavior O
and O
tried O
an O
apology O
for O
his O
total O
lack O
of O
professionalism O
and O
attention. O

Lastly, O
since O
some O
restaurants O
do O
not O
charge O
for O
the O
table O
service O
and O
others O
do, O
they O
could O
explain O
it O
in O
the O
letter, O
so O
we O
could O
decide O
whether O
we O
go O
or O
not. O

Surprising, O
it’s O
like O
being O
in O
New O
York O
and O
Paris O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
spectacular O
decoration, B-TARGET
incredible O
staff B-TARGET
and O
their O
fresh O
market O
food B-TARGET
fascinate O
me, O
I O
recommend O
them O
guys, O
luck. O

Everything O
was O
very O
rich O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
very O
friendly. O

Hello O
JOse O
we O
have O
been O
several O
times O
in O
Pelentos O
de O
Sandiniés, O
and O
I O
think O
like O
you, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
recommended O
dining B-TARGET
room. I-TARGET

Believe O
that O
in O
the O
magnificent O
photographic O
report O
that O
you O
have O
made O
there O
is O
an O
error O
where O
you O
say O
Ajoarriero O
is O
not O
so, O
that O
of O
the O
photo O
are O
Peanuts O
filled. O

And O
the O
special O
menu O
is O
not O
30 O
but O
27 O
euros. O

Regarding O
the O
children O
and O
the O
stairs O
I O
think O
it O
is O
our O
problem O
we O
have O
already O
grown O
up, O
I O
have O
been O
touched O
by O
all O
being O
pretty O
black O
and O
being O
very O
comfortable, O
anyway O
we O
will O
eat O
and O
that O
I O
do O
relax, O
like O
and O
thank O
you O
for O
what O
you O
give O
me O
without O
asking O
that O
is O
education, O
affection O
and O
a O
smile. O

And O
now O
Jose O
ask O
you O
what O
right O
do O
we O
have O
to O
talk O
about O
anyone O
on O
the O
net O
without O
asking O
them O
permission? O

Even O
if O
it O
is O
to O
speak O
well. O

For O
if O
you O
want O
to O
update O
your O
information O
now O
have O
a O
Spring B-TARGET
Menu I-TARGET
for O
19 O
euros O
and O
children's B-TARGET
menu O
for O
15 O
euros O
that O
is O
great, O
I O
recommend O
you O
to O
return, O
just O
like O
I O
do O
and O
maybe O
it O
is O
judged O
with O
more O
equity O
(we O
already O
have O
a O
table O
reserved O
for O
April O
28, O
we O
celebrate O
my O
meeting) O

Greetings O
to O
Joaquina O

Hello O
Joaquina, O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
clarifications O
of O
the O
photos, O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
prices O
also O
thank O
you O
for O
giving O
the O
new O
prices, O
in O
the O
articles O
I O
indicate O
the O
price O
there O
was O
at O
the O
time.Just O
clarify O
that O
in O
the O
criticism O
I O
do O
not O
speak O
of O
anyone, O
I O
am O
only O
telling O
my O
experience O
when O
using O
the O
services O
of O
a O
company, O
in O
this O
case O
a O
restaurant, O
which O
I O
paid O
rigorously. O

Can O
we O
not O
even O
think O
about O
what O
we O
buy? O

I O
want O
to O
think O
that O
yes. O

It O
would O
be O
censorship O
and O
coercion. O

We O
were O
recommended O
to O
dinner O
on O
Christmas O
and O
we O
took O
a O
great O
disappointment: O
not O
only O
did O
the O
raw B-TARGET
materials I-TARGET
leave O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
(wrapped O
with O
gambas O
and O
pre-frozen O
bag O
mushrooms) O
but O
the O
amounts B-TARGET
were O
irrisory O
for O
the O
price. O

The O
baccarat B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
oven O
(speciality O
of O
the O
house) O
was O
shortened O
and O
hard, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
deer I-TARGET
(26 O
euros O
the O
dish) O
was O
scarce O
and O
barely O
without O
guarnition. O

Hi, O
I O
want O
to O
leave O
my O
opinion O
about O
this O
restaurant O
in O
the O
only O
visit O
I O
have O
made, O
I O
fully O
agree O
with O
Mr. O
Aranda O
that O
the O
amount O
is O
quite O
scarce O
in O
some O
dishes B-TARGET
in O
relation O
to O
its O
price. O

I O
also O
have O
to O
highlight O
that O
the O
entrances B-TARGET
were O
mostly O
cold O
and O
some O
peppers B-TARGET
could O
not O
be O
eaten O
because O
they O
had O
simply O
taken O
them O
from O
the O
refrigerator O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
quality O
is O
high, O
but O
you O
could O
correct O
those O
errors O
so O
that O
the O
satisfaction O
was O
greater O
as O
well O
as O
give O
a O
greater O
amount O
of O
product. O

Last O
night O
we O
dined O
at O
Casa O
Pelentós O
de O
Sandiniés, O
where O
we O
already O
did O
it O
on O
another O
occasion O
with O
greater O
fortune, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
we O
wanted O
to O
repeat. O

It O
was O
disappointing, O
due, O
in O
particular, O
to O
the O
shortage O
in O
the O
second B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
in O
relation O
to O
the O
prices. O

The O
bill B-TARGET
is O
high, O
which O
we O
already O
expected, O
but O
not O
so O
much. O

But O
soon O
we O
knew O
why: O
the O
six O
slices O
of O
bread O
were O
billed O
at O
2.40 O
euros; O
and O
I, O
who O
couldn’t O
drink O
wine O
because O
I O
had O
to O
go O
home O
through O
many O
curves, O
got O
a O
glass O
jar O
with O
water O
from O
the O
barrel. O

It O
did O
not O
matter O
much O
that O
out O
of O
the O
grey, O
given O
that O
the O
water O
of O
the O
area O
is O
excellent; O
but O
for O
that O
we O
were O
billed O
2.50 O
euros. O

My O
wife,, O
when O
checking O
the O
invoice B-TARGET
and O
discovering O
this O
latter, O
took O
a O
good O
disgust, O
because O
we O
considered O
Casa O
Pelentós O
one O
of O
our O
few O
Pyrenees O
refugees O
for O
when O
we O
left O
home, O
as O
we O
lived O
very O
close. O

Obviously, O
for O
the O
2.50 O
euros O
charged O
for O
the O
water B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
barrel, O
they O
have O
lost O
two O
customers. O

Yesterday O
we O
had O
dinner O
at O
Colette. O

An O
excellent O
dinner! B-TARGET

It O
was O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
that O
a O
restaurant O
in O
Zaragoza O
did O
not O
surprise O
me O
in O
this O
way: O
Great O
quality O
of O
the O
product, B-TARGET
numerous O
details, B-TARGET
perfect O
cooking B-TARGET
points I-TARGET
in O
almost O
every O
dish, O
abundant O
rations B-TARGET
and O
a O
high O
but O
quality-adjusted O
price.The O
service B-TARGET
was O
attentive O
and O
polite O
although O
it O
had O
some O
small O
failure O
(like O
serving O
the O
second O
bottle O
of O
wine O
in O
the O
cups O
in O
which O
there O
was O
still O
something O
left O
of O
the O
previous O
one)First O
a O
good O
variety O
of O
breads O
(pizza, O
green O
olive, O
black O
olive,...) O
with O
a O
spoon O
of O
olive O
oil O
with O
tomato O
mozzarella O
and O
albahaca. O

A O
few O
snacks O
offered O
by O
the O
house O
with O
a O
white O
martini O
cocktail O
cooled O
with O
liquid O
nitrogen O
and O
a O
tablet O
of O
foie O
mi-cuit O
wrapped O
in O
raspberry O
with O
cider O
and O
coconut O
cotton. O

Very O
successful O
both. O

As O
entrances O
we O
share:- O
an O
excellent, O
tasty O
Kobe B-TARGET
boo I-TARGET
carpaccio.- I-TARGET
a O
tempura O
of O
strawberries O

with O
foie O
and O

an O
entire B-TARGET
tail I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
bogavante I-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
its I-TARGET
coral I-TARGET
(very O
tasty, O
although O
a O
little O
bit O
passed O
by O
point)Before O
the O
second O
the O
house O
offered O
us O
a O
pinch O
of O
membrillo O
and O
tempura O
cheese O
presented O
in O
a O
strawberries. O

Very O
original O
presentation B-TARGET
and O
very O
successful O
combination.The B-TARGET
seconds O
were O
a O
little O
more O
traditional: O

- O
Salmon O
with O
foie O
and O
seasonal O
mushrooms: O
gigantic O
ration O
and O
point O
exactly O
as O
asked, O
something O
uncommon. O

Stir O
at O
low O
temperature O
with O
caramelized O
sauce O
and O
truffled O

and O

Rape O

cooked O
at O

Only O
the O

Maybe O
it O
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
less O
done, O
but O
very O
tasty O
and O
also O
accompanied O
by O
an O
excellent O
puré. B-TARGET

Another O
house O
entertainment O
before O
the O
dessert O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
dehydrated O
strawberries O
and O
confit O
with O
vanilla O
soup O
(served O
in O
a O
dry O
ice O
cup O
to O
make O
a O
bubbling O
volcanic O
effect). O

Spectacular O
and O
very O
tasty. O

We O
only O
ordered O
two O
desserts B-TARGET
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
they O
were O
the O
most O
smooth O
of O
the O
dinner: O

- O
A O
crisp O
apple O
cake O
with O
vanilla O
ice O
cream.- O
A O
chocolate O
coulant O
with O
ice O
cream. O

When O
we O
were O
finished, O
we O
got O
some O
cake. O

There O
the O
majority O
stayed, O
they O
were O
quite O
normal O
and O
in O
addition O
we O
could O
no O
longer.In O
summary O
280 O
€ O
for O
4 O
people O
including O
two O
bottles O
of O
Enate O
Merlot-merlot O
(which O
contributed O
in O
60 O
€ O
to O
the O
bill)I O
think O
a O
account O
nothing O
disproportionate O
with O
the O
quality O
and O
quantity O
of O
the O
food O
and O
the O
details O
they O
offered O
us. O

A O
good O
place B-TARGET
next. O

If O
you O
maintain O
the O
level O
of O
innovation O
and O
quality O
can O
be O
a O
breath O
of O
fresh O
air O
in O
Zaragoza. O

by O
P.D. O

So O
what O
I O
read O
in O
previous O
comments O
have O
had O
to O
reduce O
prices, O
because O
yesterday O
the O
tempura O
of O
shrimp O
and O
foie O
cost O
18 O
€ O
and O
not O
the O
22 O
that O
are O
mentioned O
in O
another O
comment. O

If O
so, O
well O
done. O

Very O
good O
description O
Pedro, O
I O
have O
not O
been O
yet O
at O
the O
Colette O
restaurant, O
I O
have O
read O
some O
negative O
opinions O
and O
others O
positive, O
but O
of O
course O
for O
what O
you O
comment O
is O
very O
recommended O
its O
kitchen. O

I’m O
a O
bit O
reluctant O
to O
molecular O
cooking. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
other, O
the O
q-art, O
and O
I O
came O
out O
very O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O
local O
– O
is O
there O
a O
non-smoking O
area O
in O
the O
Colette? O

Is O
there O
a O
separation O
between O
tables? O

Hi O
JoseEn O
Colette O
does O
not O
have O
a O
non-smoking O
area. O

In O
fact, O
it O
is O
a O
rather O
small O
place. B-TARGET

The O
tables B-TARGET
are O
large O
and O
the O
space O
between O
them O
is O
quite O
wide. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
quite O
full O
(although O
not O
complete) O
and O
yet O
we O
were O
very O
quiet, O
with O
almost O
total O
privacy. O

Although O
there O
were O
smokers O
on O
the O
next O
table O
we O
did O
not O
feel O
any O
discomfort O
during O
the O
meal. O

I O
think O
the O
ventilation B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
good, O
although O
I O
don’t O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
there O
were O
more O
smokers O
or O
more O
compulsives. O

Regarding O
“molecular O
cooking,” O
don’t O
worry: O
I O
like O
“molecular O
cooking” O
a O
lot, O
but O
Colette’s O
is O
not. O

It O
is O
a O
pretty O
traditional O
kitchen O
in O
concepts O
but O
aligns O
them O
with O
modern O
and O
well-applied O
cooking B-TARGET
procedures, I-TARGET
along O
with O
creative O
presentations. B-TARGET

The O
most O
notable O
thing O
for O
me O
is O
the O
use O
of O
low-temperature B-TARGET
cooking I-TARGET
in O
many O
dishes O
and O
spectacular O
and O
worked O
presentations. B-TARGET

The O
list B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
that O
appears O
complete O
in O
the O
offer, O
in O
the O
international O
section O
nothing O
of O
nothing O
have O
any O
of O
the O
references. O

In O
the O
rest O
three O
of O
the O
wines B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
exhausted, O
already O
desperate O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
rioja O
the O
one O
that O
could, O
bring O
us O
a O
Roda B-TARGET
ll I-TARGET
2004, I-TARGET
well, O
the O
wine O
is O
presented O
hot, O
finely O
bochornosa O
situation. O

The O
card B-TARGET
is O
unattractive, O
the O
calamares B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
Andalusian I-TARGET
impossible, O
crystal B-TARGET
peppers I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
anchoes, I-TARGET
swimming O
in O
mediocre O
quality O
oil, O
baccarat B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
porros I-TARGET
cream, I-TARGET
covered O
by O
an O
exaggerated O
called O
rucula O
salad, O
the O
set O
of B-TARGET
dish O
bad, O
lamb O
palette O
well O
in O
its O
execution, O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
very O
loose. O

The O
apartment B-TARGET
is O
well-equipped O
and O
well-installed. O

We O
entered O
with O
great O
expectation O
and O
left O
very O
disappointed. O

Good O
restaurant, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
cuisine, B-TARGET
but... O
being O
so O
small, O
the O
tobacco B-TARGET
smoke I-TARGET
ruins O
your O
whole O
dinner. O

It’s O
amazing O
that O
you O
can O
smoke O
in O
a O
place O
like O
this. O

Let’s O
see O
if O
they O
change O
the O
law O
soon O
and O
we O
can O
taste O
the O
good O
cuisine B-TARGET
without O
appetizing O
alterations O
like O
that O
of O
tobacco... B-TARGET

In O
two O
words?-a O
shitIn O
more O
words?Dear, O
hortera, O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
cave, O
minimal O
meals B-TARGET
and O
dishes B-TARGET
of O
the O
most O
normal.The O
only O
thing O
about O
the O
author, O
is O
the O
photo B-TARGET
that O
really O
is O
worthy O
of O
the O
award O
to O
the O
shame O
of O
others, O
(...). O

A O
shame O
what O
we O
have O
been O
charged, O
the O
entrants O
have O
suggested O
and O
we O
have O
been O
charged O
9 O
euros O
for O
each O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomato.We I-TARGET
went O
12 O
and O
we O
paid O
case O
700 O
euros O
and O
we O
had O
to O
ask O
that O
we O
were O
invited O
to O
a O
chop. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
jamon I-TARGET
entrance..25 I-TARGET
euros?? O

And O
the O
bread O
that O
we O
have O
not O
asked O
for... O
finally O
I O
advise O
you O
all O
not O
to O
enter O
this O
place B-TARGET
because O
you O
will O
be O
charged O
only O
for O
entering. O

For O
this O
money O
as O
real O
in O
a O
place O
in O
conditions O

is O
a O
unique O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza, O
it O
is O
small, O
comfortable O
and O
very O
private, O
the O
decoration B-TARGET
is O
perfect O
as O
it O
makes O
it O
very O
cozy, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
special O
and O
of O
very O
good O
quality. O

This O
is O
a O
restore B-TARGET
to O
repeat O
my O
note O
is O
9. O

Regarding O
the O
price, O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
with O
the O
quality O
and O
service O
and O
exclusivity O
this O
is O
perfect, O
but O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
with O
other O
restaurants O
of O
this O
class O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
Spain. O

Remember O
that O
Zaragoza O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
city. O

I O
only O
said O
that O
it O
is O
a O
hallucinate O
site, B-TARGET
food O
and O
decoration, O
what O
I O
like O
most O
was O
the O
food B-TARGET
since O
it O
is O
of O
very O
good O
quality, O
I O
hope O
that O
in O
the O
future O
it O
will O
be O
the O
same O
and O
that O
it O
will O
not O
change. O

A O
place B-TARGET
to O
repeat O
and O
recommend. O

of O
the O
price, O
if O
you O
compare O
it O
with O
the O
quality, O
the O
attention O
and O
the O
place, O
it O
is O
at O
the O

JAVIER O

I O
want O
to O
poyar O
and O
fender O
if O
there O
is O
a O
place O
for O
it, O
to O
Luis O
Argente: O
I O
am O
Ernesto O
Tejados O
and O
I O
have O
a O
restaurant. O

I O
was O
the O
one O
who O
warned O
Luis O
of O
this O
comment O
on O
Monday. O

I O
told O
him O
you O
have O
made O
this O
comment O
from O
the O
restaurant O
vetula, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
know O
what O
I O
was O
talking O
about, O
then O
show O
him O
the O
page O
that O
I O
did O
not O
know O
and O
continuation O
was O
put O
in O
contact O
to O
solve O
this O
misunderstood. O

I O
think O
he O
knew O
nothing O
of O
anything. O

and O
salutations. O

by O
Ernesto. O

I O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
my O
fulfillment, O
and O
samilos O
delighted, O
we O
will O
repeat O
sure. O

All O
in O
small O
quantities O
but O
very O
good, O
very O
well O
cooked, O
and O
the O
perfect O
treatment. B-TARGET

It’s O
not O
to O
go O
every O
week, O
pq O
is O
a O
little O
more O
expensive, O
q O
the O
typical O
informal O
restaurant, O
but O
it’s O
worth O
it, O
for O
a O
special O
celebration. O

thank O
you O

It O
is O
shameful!! O

I O
spoke O
with O
the O
restaurant O
the O
night O
before O
and O
very O
gently O
explained O
to O
me O
the O
3 O
menus O
they O
had O
for O
between O
week. O

I O
chose O
the O
most O
expensive O
and O
booked. O

38 O
euros O
with O
cellar O
included.The O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
not O
bad: O
Iberian O
jam O
with O
bread O
with O
tomatoes, O
lime O
with O
paprika, O
potatoes O
confited O
with O
foie O
and O
melosus O
rice O
(of O
mushrooms). O

Secondly O
to O
choose O
several O
dishes O
among O
which O
were O
baccarat, O
rap, O
salmon, O
cochillino, O
steak O
tartar,...The O
first B-TARGET
were O
centers O
that O
to O
taste O
were O
good, O
but O
let’s, O
scarce. O

If O
there O
were O
a O
good O
dish, O
I O
would O
not O
say O
‘mu’, O
but O
no. O

Secondly O
a O
plate O
of O
good O
quality O
(but O
not O
exceptional) O
and O
again O
scarce O
(at O
least O
by O
the O
quality/quantity/price O
ratio). O

The O
dessert... O
2 O
pastels O
of O
the O
little O
ones O
from O
any O
bakery O
per O
person. O

Whether O
they O
are O
own O
or O
not, O
I O
don’t O
say O
anything. O

But O
again O
few O
(and O
nothing O
special). O

At O
the O
end O
we O
paid: O
38 O
per O
person, O
10 O
euros O
for O
a O
dish B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
tomatoes I-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
garden I-TARGET
that O
they O
cultivated O
(offered O
suddenly O
having O
the O
menu O
closed O
and O
without O
warning O
of O
the O
price), O
2 O
euros O
for O
coffee, B-TARGET
5.5 O
for O
pacharán O
(of O
this O
I O
do O
not O
say O
anything, O
if O
you O
ask O
you O
pay) O
and O
13 O
euros O
for O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
having O
the O
menu O
closed. O

Added O
to O
VAT. O

After O
interested O
in O
that O
‘extra-cost’ O
of O
wine O
they O
say O
that O
they O
consider O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
is O
every O
3 O
or O
4, O
so O
when O
asking O
3 O
and O
going O
6, O
I O
get O
1. O

I O
don’t O
know O
what O
they O
do O
with O
the O
couples. O

As O
the O
title O
puts O
it: O
shameful!!! O

You O
can’t O
go O
sophisticated O
deceiving O
and O
trying O
to O
get O
money O
out O
of O
any O
discount O
from O
the O
beginners. O

I O
find O
it O
embarrassing O
that O
they O
charge O
a O
bottle B-TARGET
because O
by O
being O
6 O
people O
in O
the O
menu O
only O
correspond O
to O
2. O

Especially O
being O
the O
price O
of O
38 O
euros O
(more O
VAT) O
and O
being O
the O
food B-TARGET
rather O
scarce O
and O
without O
providing O
more O
quality O
than O
that O
of O
many O
other O
sites O
at O
a O
better O
price. O

The O
Three O
Tenors? O

Jajajaja, O
I O
laugh O
at O
the O
tenors. O

I O
laughed O
after O
they O
laughed O
out O
of O
my O
pocket. O

Avoid O
it O
if O
you O
can!! O

We O
were O
dining O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
on O
Saturday O
19 O
November, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
local B-TARGET
raises O
many O
spectacles, O
which O
are O
then O
disappointed O
by O
the O
food, B-TARGET
normal, O
the O
amount O
not O
scarce, O
but O
minimal, O
the O
very O
defective O
service, B-TARGET
and O
the O
astronomical O
price. O

In O
short, O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
lot O
of O
ínfulas O
that O
is O
left O
in O
nothing. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
absolutely. O

I O
don’t O
really O
know, O
the O
place O
you O
refer O
to O
almost O
all, O
but O
on O
Saturday O
night O
on O
January O
21, O
2012, O
we O
were O
dining O
a O
bunch O
of O
friends O
(8 O
pax.) O

We O
had O
a O
great O
dinner, O
both O
in O
quality O
and O
quantity. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
also O
on O
top. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful O
and O
welcoming; O
it O
was O
all O
excellent, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
all O
those O
people O
who O
want O
to O
enjoy O
it O
with O
elegance. O

Great O
dinner B-TARGET
on O
Saturday O
night O
with O
a O
Groupalia O
bonus. O

Excellent O
quality O
and O
price. O

Today O
and O
tomorrow O
is O
still O
the O
offer, O
but O
if O
anyone O
wants O
to O
buy O
it.40 O
€ O
for O
a O
menu B-TARGET
tasting I-TARGET
with O
good O
product, O
very O
well O
cooked O
and O
including O
gin-tonic, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
unbeatable.That O
is, O
for O
my O
taste O
the O
gin O
tonic O
better O
without O
violet, O
although O
I O
am O
a O
lover O
of O
violet O
candy, O
better O
each O
thing O
on O
its O
site. O

Saturday O
night, O
reserve O
for O
4 O
people O
in O
the O
colette, O
and O
when O
we O
arrive O
not O
only O
do O
we O
have O
no O
reservation O
but O
the O
colette, O
supposedly O
of O
more O
quality O
than O
the O
Quartz, O
no O
longer O
exists O
as O
such, O
they O
tell O
us O
that O
they O
have O
merged, O
they O
are O
the O
same O
restaurant O
and O
they O
seek O
us O
a O
table O
in O
this O
last. O

Without O
offering O
us O
the O
menu O
letter O
they O
give O
us O
the O
dish O
letter, O
I O
suppose O
to O
see O
if O
it O
falls, O
until O
we O
ask O
for O
the O
menus, O
which O
then O
explain O
to O
us O
the O
excellences O
of O
their O
menus, O
which O
is O
not O
of O
poor O
quality O
even O
though O
we O
order O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
from O
the O
letter, O
since O
you O
can O
not O
choose O
color, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
does O
not O
seem O
to O
us O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
supposed O
quality O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
local B-TARGET
is O
narrow O
and O
lengthy O
so O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
communicate O
without O
screaming O
if O
it O
is O
full, O
as O
is O
the O
case. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
excessive O
the O
rating O
on O
this O
website, O
without O
the O
intention O
of O
discouraging O
the O
restaurant, O
knowing O
what O
they O
offer. O

Only O
in O
Zaragoza, O
it O
was O
time!!! O

Excellent O
facilities, B-TARGET
very O
good O
care B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
kitchen... B-TARGET
worthy O
of O
a O
try. O

I O
recommend O
it!! O

A O
Sunday O
at O
noon O
pay O
the O
newcomer O
to O
eat O
there, O
but O
one O
and O
no O
more. O

It O
has O
6 O
months, O
we O
were O
in O
the O
whole O
restaurant O
about O
13 O
people O
and O
three O
camarades O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
PENSING O
a O
lot O
of O
white O
gloves O
put O
but O
they O
leave O
you O
the O
same O
covered O
of O
the O
enters O
to O
desserts, O
the O
dishes O
are O
accumulated O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
table O
and O
do O
not O
take O
them O
away, O
you O
need O
bread O
and O
you O
almost O
have O
to O
pray O
it. O

The O
scarce O
rations B-TARGET
for O
what O
you O
charge, O
for O
example, O
a O
dish B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
three I-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
three I-TARGET
hearts I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
shaped I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
tempura I-TARGET
make O
you O
22 O
euros O
and O
the O
strawberries B-TARGET
do O
not O
rarely O
reach O
60 O
grams. O

That O
if O
a O
lot O
of O
caramels O
with O
tears O
of O
acite O
but O
like O
you O
fall O
a O
blanket O
or O
tell O
the O
maid, B-TARGET
if O
you O
catch O
it, O
or O
you O
clean O
it O
yourself. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O

I O
have O
been O
on O
various O
occasions O
doing O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
and O
then O
we O
ate O
in O
the O
restaurant.The O
food B-TARGET
appeared O
good O
to O
the O
people O
we O
have O
been O
eating, O
that O
if O
we O
have O
never O
eaten O
the O
menu, O
as O
long O
as O
we O
have O
eaten O
we O
have O
been O
advised O
by O
the O
person O
who O
served O
us O
at O
the O
table, O
we O
normally O
shared O
some O
entrants O
and O
then O
each O
chose O
what O
he O
wanted. O

We O
also O
spent O
a O
couple O
of O
nights O
in O
the O
Spa O
with O
circuit O
and O
full O
pension O
and O
of O
course O
the O
menus B-TARGET
left O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
accommodated O
TAMPOCO O
enters O
the O
wine, O
you O
can O
ask O
but O
with O
their O
corresponding O
charge O
to O
the O
habiación. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
for O
such O
excellent O
facilities. O

I O
go O
a O
lot O
to O
the O
Paracuellos O
Balneario O
of O
Jiloca, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
they O
give O
me O
is O
always O
STUPENDA, O
they O
put O
you O
a O
lot O
of O
quantity O
and O
in O
addition O
with O
quality. O

I O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone. O

Yesterday O
I O
was O
in O
the O
Balneario O
performing O
an O
algae O
envelope O
and O
a O
thermal O
circuit. O

I O
came O
out O
fascinated, O
in O
the O
morning O
do O
the O
envelope, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
in O
the O
gym. O

We O
ate O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
of O
the O
bathroom O
which, O
by O
the O
way, O
is O
to O
congratulate O
the O
food, B-TARGET
which O
we O
ate O
well. O

In O
the O
afternoon O
we O
performed O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
that O
was O
phenomenal O
all O
afternoon O
bathing. O

Only O
one O
thing O
is O
missing O
that O
in O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
have O
water O
to O
drink O
if O
you O
are O
thirsty. O

I O
was O
at O
the O
Hotel O
Balneario O
Paracuellos O
of O
Jiloca, O
doing O
the O
thermal O
circuit O
in O
the O
morning O
of O
course O
I O
love!!!!, O

We’ve O
also O
eaten O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
SUPER, O
you’ll O
also O
get O
to O
eat O
this O
delicious O
food!!! O

In O
the O
afternoon O
we O
did O
treatments O
and O
massages O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
outdoor O
pool O
and O
the O
solarium. O

Wonderful, O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
you!!! O

Hi, O
I O
was O
at O
the O
Hotel O
Balneario O
Paracuellos O
of O
Jiloca, O
spending O
a O
few O
days O
and O
the O
truth O
I O
like O
very O
much. O

The O
attention O
of O
all O
the O
reception O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
dining O
room, O
the O
spa O
is O
nice O
make O
you O
feel O
very O
comfortable O
and O
like O
at O
home. O

The O
very O
good O
and O
abundant O
food B-TARGET
in O
addition O
the O
day O
before O
give O
you O
to O
choose O
what O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
the O
next O
day.We O
like O
it O
all O
a O
lot O
and O
we O
will O
soon O
come O
back!!! O

1/02/2012 O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
people O
can O
complain O
about O
the O
food O
in O
the O
restaurant O
of O
the O
spa, O
we O
were O
9 O
days O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
varied O
very O
abundant O
and O
exquisite. O

The O
attention O
of O
the O
waitresses B-TARGET
exceptional,we O
will O
return O
even O
if O
only O
for O
the O
attention O
received O
thanks O
to O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
for O
your O
attention. O

It O
is O
an O
appreciation, O
but O
the O
rabbit B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
strawberries, O
precisely O
is O
cooked O
so, O
with O
the O
oil O
of O
having O
it O
cooked, O
which O
carries O
all O
the O
taste. O

It’s O
not O
that O
it O
swims O
in O
oil, O
it’s O
that O
it’s O
thrown O
out O
so O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
get O
dry O
and O
you O
can O
soak. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
you O
don’t O
like O
it. O

It O
is O
the O
spa O
where O
we O
have O
eaten O
worse, O
unlike O
the O
others O
I O
know, O
poor O
preparation, B-TARGET
little O
variety, B-TARGET
not O
even O
breakfasts B-TARGET
are O
appetizable. O

The O
bathroom O
as O
such O
is O
very O
good, O
for O
that O
there O
is O
no O
complaint. O

Excellent O
thermal O
circuit. O

As O
far O
as O
food B-TARGET
is O
concerned, O
it O
is O
not O
really O
bad. O

They O
are O
not O
rimbombant O
dishes B-TARGET
(already O
several O
people O
have O
told O
me O
that O
the O
Alhama O
of O
Aragon O
food O
is O
better), O
but O
they O
are O
eaten O
and O
they O
were O
fine. O

I O
remember O
that O
I O
ordered O
cheesecakes B-TARGET
and O
they O
were O
very O
good, O
like O
a O
seafood B-TARGET
puré I-TARGET
that O
was O
rich. O

Although O
it O
was O
more O
or O
less O
normal O
the O
rest O
(the O
bathroom O
entrances B-TARGET
are O
the O
same O
as O
those O
that O
appear O
in O
the O
photo), O
it O
was O
allowed O
to O
eat. O

It O
won’t O
be O
to O
get O
into O
selected O
paladars, O
but O
it O
wasn’t O
bad. O

Of O
course O
I O
expected O
it O
worse O
for O
the O
comments, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
so, O
fortunately. O

Friendly O
and O
correct O
service, B-TARGET
somewhat O
slow O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
maybe O
there O
was O
a O
great O
occupation. O

Food, O
right O
entrances B-TARGET
except O
for O
the O
bad O
pinches, B-TARGET
the O
grilled B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cigars I-TARGET
well. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
professional O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
quality O
of O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
a O
better O
quality/price O
relationship. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
below O
the O
above, O
but B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
set I-TARGET
is I-TARGET
good I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
very I-TARGET
recommended I-TARGET

A O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
food. B-TARGET

I O
would O
repeat O
at O
the O
time O
of O
another O
group O
dinner. O

Excellent O
disguise B-TARGET
menu. I-TARGET

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
as O
well O
as O
the O
service. B-TARGET

I O
will O
repeat. O

Last O
Saturday O
we O
ate O
dinner O
with O
some O
friends, O
they O
invited O
us O
to O
a O
cup O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
abundant, O
very O
good O
quality O
price O
relationship O
and O
the O
dining B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
very O
nice O
as O
well O
as O
the O
service. B-TARGET

very O
badly. O

We O
made O
a O
group B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
super O
scarce O
with O
a O
portion B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
that O
laughed O
to O
see O
her. O

Apart O
they O
put O
only O
one O
bottle O
of O
wine O
for O
each O
6 O
and O
charged O
us O
for O
the O
others. O

Solomilloo B-TARGET
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
of O
grandfather O
because O
he O
was O
wretched. O

Very O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
treatment. B-TARGET

But O
when O
I O
got O
home O
I O
realized O
that O
I O
didn’t O
get O
the O
10% O
discount O
that O
the O
booking O
said. O

For O
merit, O
do O
not O
put O
yourself O
as O
a O
woman, O
which O
is O
not O
for O
so O
much, O
sure O
you O
are O
one O
of O
the O
ones O
you O
like O
to O
make O
the O
ball O
invite O
you O
to O
chopsticks, O
and O
on O
top O
give O
it O
to O
you O

and O
bad. O

The O
treatment O
of O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
toward O
the O
customers O
was O
quite O
bad: O
edges, O
bad O
faces, O
etc... O

Fatal O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
price. O

It O
is O
expensive O
and O
it O
is O
poorly O
eaten. O

I O
was O
last O
Friday O
night, O
it O
was O
incredible, O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters O
impeccable O
and O
very O
sympathetic, O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
achieved, O
very O
recommendable O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
very O
welcoming O

It O
has O
really O
been O
a O
discovery, O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
Barcelona, O
a O
local O
where O
you O
eat O
good O
menu B-TARGET
both O
on O
working O
days O
and O
on O
holidays. O

San O
Jordi O
has O
been O
the O
test O
with O
the O
whole O
family, O
and O
I O
go O
round, O
a O
good O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
good O
price O
and O

Excellent O
service B-TARGET
menu B-TARGET

Dinner O
for O
two O
with O
a O
very O
good O
attention O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
we O
found O
a O
quiet O
and O
cozy O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food, O
in O
our O
case O
a O
chato B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
to O
share O
and O
an O
duck B-TARGET
magret, I-TARGET
excellent! O

I O
recommend O
it, O
we O
will O
come O
back. O

We O
presented O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
choosing O
dishes O
to O
the O
table, O
but O
they O
presented O
us O
with O
a O
very O
correct O
menu B-TARGET
and O
a O
suitable O
price, O
so O
that O
was O
our O
selection. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
very O
correct O
in O
presentation O
quantity O
and O
flavors. O

Service B-TARGET
and O
attention O
very O
good. O

We O
will O
return O

The O
attention O
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
if O
you O
reserve, O
you O
should O
not O
mount O
the O
table O
apart O
if O
you O
have O
realized O
that O
the O
dining O
room O
is O
full, O
if O
not O
for O
what O
to O
reserve? O

The O
portion B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
short O
for O
what O
is O
paid O
for O
by O
dish, B-TARGET
although O
well O
made. O

Very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
an O
ideal O
place O
to O
go O
from O
menu B-TARGET
eating O
quality. O

As O
they O
have O
always O
been O
at O
the O
height, O
quality, O
perfect O
price O
and O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
extremely O
friendly. O

Very O
convenient O
location B-TARGET
to O
move O
by O
public O
transport, O
metro O
and O
bus O
next O
door. O

The O
customer O
service B-TARGET
is O
not O
the O
right O
one O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
at O
the O
price O
level. O

Good O
attention, B-TARGET
but O
the O
rest O
is O
fatal. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
dirt, O
it O
is O
not O
comfortable, O
the O
laundry B-TARGET
very O
dirty, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
super O
dirty, O
and O
the O
kitchen O
fatal, O
food B-TARGET
without O
texture, O
very O
industrial, O
like O
a O
daily O
menu, O
at O
10,0 O
€. O

The O
opinions O
I O
read O
before O
I O
went, O
completely O
confused O
me. O

<->We O
asked O
a O
la O
carte O
(not O
the O
menu O
of O
the O
day) O
paella B-TARGET
as O
the O
main O
dish O
– O
almost O
burned, O
past O
rice. O

<-> O
Gambas B-TARGET
resecas O
and O
we O
don’t O
know O
why, O
but O
they O
filled O
it O
with O
pieces O
of O
that O
“pale-shaped O
succession O
but B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
gamba I-TARGET
taste” I-TARGET
that O
was O
almost O
rubber-impossible O
to O
eat. O

We O
couldn’t O
eat O
even O
half O
the O
paella. B-TARGET

+ O
very O
friendly O
staff. B-TARGET

<+> O
Passable O
entrances B-TARGET
- O
normal O
of O
taste O

Very O
good O
quality O
relationship. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
all O
fantastic. O

We O
will O
return O
safely. O

Well, O
in O
general, O
a O
little O
slow O
the O
service B-TARGET

and O
correct. O

diligent O
service B-TARGET
with O
the O
will O
to O
comply. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
improved, O
alongside O
excellent O
dishes O
such O
as O
bacon, B-TARGET
others O
not O
as O
much O
as O
tuna, O
too O
made. O

Excellent O
cuisine, B-TARGET
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
are O
exquisite O

Great O
restaurant, B-TARGET
good O
atmosphere O
and O
service. B-TARGET

Extremely O
together O
the O
tables B-TARGET
the O
dishes B-TARGET
without O
any O
taste. O

The O
excellent O
bread. B-TARGET

Somewhat O
messy O
entrance, B-TARGET
with O
paper O
on O
the O
floor.metro O
vibration O
and O
annoying O
room O
noise. O

If O
the O
food B-TARGET
tastes O
the O
same, O
the O
rest O
is O
the O
same. O

Great O
location B-TARGET
and O
lighting. B-TARGET

Perfect O
quality-price O
ratio, O
very O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
and O
exquisite O
food. B-TARGET

Totally O
recommended. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
attentive, O
the O
entrants B-TARGET
are O
very O
good. O

Paella B-TARGET
is O
good O
for O
the O
price. O

Everything O
was O
very O
well. O

JR O

They O
did O
not O
answer O
me O
and O
as O
I O
had O
to O
go, O
I O
told O
them, O
I O
sent O
a O
second O
email, O
telling O
them O
to O
call O
me. O

It O
was O
not O
so. O

I O
suppose O
that O
as O
it O
was O
late O
and O
the O
day O
of O
St. O
Jordi O
could O
not O
answer. O

The O
experience O
helped O
me O
to O
get O
to O
know O
the O
restaurants. O

Excellent O
dish B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
goes O
from O
less O
to O
less O
with O
two O
final B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
realmete O
good. O

The O
restaurant O
"La O
Cullera O
de O
Boix" O
is O
excellent O
both O
for O
the O
environment B-TARGET
and O
the O
service, B-TARGET
we O
had O
no O
problem. O

The O
services B-TARGET
in O
deplorable O
condition, O
and O
the O
mantels, B-TARGET
drinks, B-TARGET
etc. O

They O
can O
improve O
cleaning. B-TARGET

As O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
I O
can O
say O
it O
was O
very O
good. O

Friendly O
staff, B-TARGET
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
smooth. O

Without O
any O
fun, O
unfavourable O
rice. B-TARGET

I O
would O
not O
recommend O
it!! O

In O
these O
times O
that O
run O
we O
all O
go O
for O
discounts O
without O
renouncing O
the O
quality, O
this O
restaurant O
gave O
the O
size O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
menu B-TARGET
tasting I-TARGET
we O
chose, O
by O
the O
way, O
all O
very O
good, O
the O
very O
good O
amounts, O
the O
hot B-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
we O
liked O
quite. O

The O
attention O
of O
the O
entire O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
was O
very O
welcoming. O

We O
will O
return. O

Nothing O
– O
Nothing O

<+ O
the O
attention B-TARGET

We O
are O
very O
happy. O

We O
were O
21 O
people, O
treated B-TARGET
exceptional, O
the O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
fine. O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
was O
the O
space, B-TARGET
we O
could O
barely O
move. O

Otherwise O
very O
well. O

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
good O
wine B-TARGET
list, I-TARGET
very O
good O
paella. B-TARGET

We O
will O
repeat. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
we O
chose O
the O
tasty B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
it O
is O
very O
complete. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
took O
a O
long O
time O
to O
bring O
the O
food, O
we O
waited O
for O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
menu O
was O
closed O
in O
advance. O

Really O
a O
great O
disappointment, O
bad O
service, B-TARGET
in O
addition O
not O
only O
the O
drink B-TARGET
is O
not O
included O
but O
you O
do O
not O
put O
any O
bread O
or O
even O
water. O

Excellent O
rice B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
and O
very O
good O
treatment. B-TARGET

It’s O
the O
second O
time O
we O
go O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
first O
time O
we O
had O
a O
bad O
experience B-TARGET
for O
a O
misunderstanding O
but O
this O
last O
time O
everything O
went O
well. O

We O
were O
treated O
wonderfully O
and O
after O
dinner O
they O
gave O
us O
a O
spoonful O
of O
wood O
to O
each O
of O
us. O

We O
celebrated O
in O
this O
restaurant O
our O
Silver O
Weddings O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
all O
perfect, O
the O
very O
attentive O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
great O
food, B-TARGET
I O
would O
highlight O
the O
croquettes B-TARGET
of O
the O
aperitif O
(delicate) O
and O
as O
not, O
the O
paella. B-TARGET

By O
putting O
some O
but, O
maybe O
the O
jam B-TARGET
was O
not O
all O
the O
"iberian" O
that O
could O
be O
expected. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Quiet O
place, B-TARGET
proper O
rations, B-TARGET
the O
best O
arroces B-TARGET
and O
the O
price. O

The O
local O
has O
a O
very O
nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
exquisite. O

The O
treatment O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
seemed O
good O
and O
varied O
with O
a O
very O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
and O
a O
pleasant O
treatment O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
with O
a O
good O
price O
quality O
ratio. O

It O
was O
all O
genial. O

We O
can’t O
give O
a O
single O
complaint O
because O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
we O
entered O
until O
our O
departure O
everything O
was O
great. O

Exquisite O
food, B-TARGET
abundant, O
very O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

For O
a O
gastronomic O
menu, O
if O
the O
food O
is O
only O
good, O
not O
to O
say O
discreet O
(in O
what O
paella B-TARGET
as O
the O
main O
dish O
refers O
to), O
the O
result O
was O
somewhat O
disappointing, O
although O
the O
price O
could O
be O
considered O
exceptional. O

I O
would O
have O
improved O
with O
a O
better O
deal, O
more O
preferred O
service, B-TARGET
more O
comfortable O
table. B-TARGET

For O
example: O
paella, O
before O
it O
is O
placed, O
is O
it O
so O
expensive O
to O
show O
it? O

It’s O
a O
detail O
that O
loses O
value. O

I O
expected O
a O
little O
more O
of O
the O
rice, B-TARGET
in O
the O
rest, O
all O
very O
right. O

A O
very O
good O
menu, B-TARGET
very O
complete. O

The O
treat B-TARGET
very O
good, O
very O
friendly, O
the O
rice B-TARGET
exquisite O
and O
half O
price, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Only O
for O
emergencies, O
not O
recommended. O

Right O
restaurant B-TARGET
without O
any O
more O
pretensions, O
abundant O
food B-TARGET
but O
without O
extraordinary O
quality. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
poor, O
slow O
and O
I O
didn’t O
know O
anything. O

The O
rice B-TARGET
didn’t O
surprise O
me O
either. O

I O
don’t O
think O
it O
repeats. O

We O
attended O
the O
restaurant O
for O
a O
company's O
Christmas O
dinner O
and O
the O
quality-price O
relationship O
stunned O
us. O

Excellent O
card B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly O
and O
diligent O
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
(we O
were O
in O
the O
private O
room) O
nice. O

We O
made O
the O
work O
dinner O
and O
we O
were O
very O
well O
served, O
the O
very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
best O
food B-TARGET
we O
made O
a O
day O
like O
this O
that O
the O
restaurants O
are O
filled O
with O
groups. O

Neither O
the O
quality O
nor O
the O
performance O
declined. O

Although O
we O
were O
several O
groups O
we O
did O
not O
suffer O
from O
the O
noise O
and O
we O
could O
talk O
without O
screaming. O

Good O
rice B-TARGET
and O
good O
quantity. O

Very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

People O
who O
have O
given O
your O
opinion, O
who O
are O
friends O
or O
family? O

Nothing O
but O
enter O
an O
impressive O
smell B-TARGET
to O
unclean O
kitchen, O
then O
some O
entrances O

of O
fear, O
navajas B-TARGET
with O
land, O
musclos B-TARGET
with O
taste O
to O
"no O
se", O
calamares B-TARGET
that O
looked O
like O
tortillitas, O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
little O
cold, O
jamon B-TARGET
iberico I-TARGET
rating O
5 O
justito O
and O
finally O
the O
paella B-TARGET
very O
good O
the O
truth, O
then O
to O
finish O
the O
work O
the O
dirty O
laundry, B-TARGET
in O
the O
renfe O
I O
think O
they O
are O
cleaner, O
because O
nothing O
more O
"very O
happy", O
we O
will O
not O
return O
more. O

very O
well. O

Pica B-TARGET
pica I-TARGET
and O
good O
wine. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
we O
were O
taken O
into O
consideration. O

A O
separate O
table, O
therefore, O
of O
privacy. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
quality. O

Excellent O
rivers B-TARGET
are. O

All O
very O
well O

We O
were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
in O
the O
old O
night O
and O
it O
was O
all O
very O
well, O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
nice. O

Good O
service, B-TARGET
good O
service O
and O
the O
price O
as O
well. O

The O
spectacular O
rocks, B-TARGET
very O
well. O

We O
prepared O
a O
dinner O
for O
Christmas O
day O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
wasn’t O
easy O
for O
us O
to O
find O
some O
restaurant O
open O
until O
I O
found O
this O
page. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
central, O
good O
prices O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
very O
good. O

We O
were O
a O
group O
of O
11 O
and O
prepared O
a O
table O
a O
little O
apart O
and O
the O
tarto B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

It O
is O
worth O
the O
menu B-TARGET
tasting, I-TARGET
for O
32.50 O
euros O
it O
has O
an O
excellent O
quality. O

The O
tapestry B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
varied O
and O
right O
price. O

By O
putting O
it O
a O
failure O
for O
the O
little O
time O
it O
has O
gone O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
attracted O
by O
the O
design O
of O
the O
local O
and O
the O
fame O
that O
is O
picking O
up O
its O
kitchen. O

I O
pass O
on O
Friday O
to O
get O
to O
know O
him, O
I’m O
impressed O
with O
the O
design O
of O
the O
local, B-TARGET
and O
let’s O
not O
say O
with O
the O
letter B-TARGET
that O
they O
have, O
I O
tried O
among O
other O
things O
an O
egg B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
65 I-TARGET
degrees I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
land I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chistorra I-TARGET
that O
was O
to O
fall O
to O
the O
ground. O

Prices O
are O
incredibly O
reasonable. O

It O
is O
worth O
it O
of O
course. O

Very O
modern O
and O
elegantly O
decorated. O

the O
terrace B-TARGET
with O
director O
chairs O
on O
the O
same O
line O
of O
elegance. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
very O
good O
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better. O

Very O
recommended. O

On O
Saturday O
01-11-14, O
we O
were O
dining O
my O
partner O
and O
I, O
and O
another O
couple, O
and O
we O
went O
out O
all O
delighted, O
I O
this O
site O
had O
only O
visited O
to O
take O
a O
cover, O
and O
as O
I O
saw O
that O
people O
spoke O
well O
of O
the O
letter, O
we O
tried O
it O
and O
it O
was O
actually O
a O
total O
right, O
over O
time O
I O
did O
not O
find O
a O
site O
with O
so O
much O
kindness O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end, O
so O
I O
can O
talk, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
we O
chose O
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
and O
everything O
was O
very O
rich, O
the O
time B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
right, O
it O
didn’t O
take O
long, O
besides O
inside O
the O
menu O
came O
all O
water, O
wine, O
coffee O
and O
even O
chopsticks, O
I O
really O
think O
back, O
and O
I O
think O
to O
try O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
letter, O
to O
know O
if O
everything, O
this O
is O
as O
rich O
as O
the O
menu B-TARGET
we O
take. O

I O
invite O
people O
to O
try O
it O
and O
opine, O
as O
it O
is O
also O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
welcoming O
place. B-TARGET

If O
you O
do O
that, O
I O
think O
you O
can O
have O
a O
good O
future. O

The O
local B-TARGET
I O
love, O
the O
service B-TARGET
very O
good, O
the O
food B-TARGET
great, O
although O
I O
would O
highlight O
the O
egg B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
65 I-TARGET
degrees I-TARGET
and O
the O
tuna O
sashimi B-TARGET
that O
is O
for O
flipping O
and O
a O
toast B-TARGET
that O
you O
get O
to O
repeat, O
I O
was O
there O
last O
Wednesday O
with O
some O
friends O
and O
we O
have O
clear O
we O
will O
come O
back, O
ah! O

Very O
reasonable O
prices O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good O
and O
very O
good O
attention, B-TARGET
the O
tasting B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
quite O
short O
in O
quantity, O
you O
need O
to O
order O
some O
dish O
more O
and O
that O
raises O
the O
price, O
because O
the O
rations B-TARGET
are O
very O
just. O

very O
well. O

Excellent O
dinner, B-TARGET
excellent O
treat. B-TARGET

The O
card B-TARGET
has O
very O
appetizing O
dishes, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
decide O
and O
the O
treat B-TARGET
is O
correct. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
they O
took O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
attend O
us O
and O
that O
little O
details O
are O
missing O
like O
a O
wine B-TARGET
letter. I-TARGET

Some O
of O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
did O
not O
have O
the O
quality O
we O
expected O
(such O
as O
brass O
pulp) B-TARGET
and O
we O
could O
not O
taste O
the O
tuna O
because O
they O
were O
finished. O

The O
price O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
high O
but O
it’s O
a O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

We O
like O
the O
site B-TARGET
very O
much, O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
attention B-TARGET
We O
take O
the O
menu B-TARGET
tasting I-TARGET
and O
it’s O
worth O
it, O
the O
rations B-TARGET
are O
not O
generous O
but O
you O
don’t O
go O
hungry, O
just O
a O
pile: O
that O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
temperate O
Very O
recommended O
for O
those O
looking O
for O
quality O
and O
not O
quantityThere O
are O
also O
no O
surprises O
that O
if O
I O
charge O
you O
more O
for O
asking O
for O
another O
bottle O
of O
wine O
or O
bread......In O
addition, O
coffee O
and O
snack O
included O
in O
the O
34€/person O

I O
was O
dining O
last O
night, O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
it, O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
in O
fact O
we O
congratulated O
the O
cook B-TARGET
(I O
think O
he O
was O
named O
Caesar). O

The O
problem O
may O
have O
been O
that O
instead O
of O
ordering O
the O
tasting O
menu O
we O
pulled O
out, O
and O
frankly, O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
a O
bit O
expensive O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
rations, O
namely, O
a O
roasted O
pulp O
with O
strawberries, O
a O
red O
tuna O
with O
teriyaki O
and O
algae, O
a O
tartare O
steak, O
a O
rock O
ferrer O
ice O
cream, O
the O
torrija O
with O
ice O
cream, O
two O
waters, O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
a O
beer O
53 O
euros O
in O
total. O

My O
companion O
had O
already O
dined O
and O
only O
pissed O
out O
my O
dishes O
for O
tasting O
them, O
that O
is, O
except O
for O
dessert O
and O
drinks, O
I O
only O
dined. O

And O
while O
I O
repeat O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
right, O
even O
above O
the O
average O
of O
what O
is O
eaten O
in O
many O
places, O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
rations B-TARGET
was O
just. O

There O
will O
be O
those O
who O
say O
rightly O
that O
53 O
euros O
for O
five O
dishes O
is O
not O
expensive O
if O
they O
are O
good, O
but O
it O
is O
that O
today O
the O
restoration O
has O
changed O
a O
lot, O
and O
you O
can O
eat O
very O
well O
at O
more O
affordable O
prices O
in O
other O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city, O
including O
some O
of O
those O
commented O
by O
Mr. O
Aranda O
in O
this O
blog. O

I O
insist O
that O
in O
fact O
the O
dinner O
was O
for O
one O
person, O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
wine. O

Next O
time O
I O
will O
order O
the O
tasting O
menu, O
and O
I O
suppose O
it O
will O
come O
out O
fairly O
more O
economical, O
and O
will O
improve O
the O
quality-price O
ratio. O

In O
any O
case O
an O
interesting O
place B-TARGET
to O
dine, O
in O
particular O
the O
pulp B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
strawberries, I-TARGET
delicious. O

We O
ordered O
the O
tasty B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
the O
truth O
was O
all O
very O
good. O

The O
truffled B-TARGET
chickens, I-TARGET
excellent, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
egg B-TARGET
and O
dessert. B-TARGET

We O
will O
come O
back O
without O
hesitation. O

We O
walked O
through O
that O
street O
and O
entered O
the O
Dobleuno O
simply O
because O
we O
wanted O
to O
tape O
something. O

We O
didn’t O
know O
him O
and O
didn’t O
expect O
anything O
special. O

The O
surprise O
was O
tremendous O
when O
we O
tried O
the O
first O
cap O
and O
it O
followed O
with O
the O
rest. O

Good O
quality O
and O
reasonable O
price. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
the O
next O
day O
we O
went O
to O
dinner. O

We O
order O
spinach O
salad, O
mushroom O
rissotto O
and O
pulp O
with O
strawberries. O

and O
Incredible. O

It’s O
not O
common O
to O
find O
so O
much O
quality O
today O
and O
that’s O
grateful. O

The O
only O
“but” O
is O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
time I-TARGET
between O
dish O
and O
dish, O
but O
I O
understand O
that O
it O
is O
not O
excessive O
if O
we O
consider O
that O
the O
dishes O
are O
very O
elaborate O
and O
are O
made O
at O
the O
moment. O

Because O
I O
disagree O
with O
the O
previous O
communicant O
I O
usually O
eat O
a O
lot O
in O
the O
Frances O
and O
although O
it O
is O
true O
that O
it O
has O
dropped O
something O
the O
quality O
is O
still O
eating O
well, O
abundant O
and O
in O
a O
welcoming O
placeI B-TARGET
recommend O
it O
because O
despite O
everything O
it O
is O
still O
eating O
well O
it O
is O
true O
that O
it O
is O
missing O
Jose O
the O
owner, O
now O
are O
the O
children O
and O
always O
loses O
something O
when O
passing O
from O
one O
generation O
to O
another O

Greetings O

I'm O
glad O
I O
can O
read O
a O
good O
review O
for O
you. O
congratulations O
Mr. B-TARGET
Aranda. I-TARGET

A O
different, O
creative O
and O
pleasant O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

We O
will O
return. O

It O
was O
all O
an O
experience. O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
treatment. B-TARGET

Excellent O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
food, B-TARGET
very O
recommended. O

The O
food B-TARGET
excellent. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
slow. O

Good O
will O
but O
excess O
of O
ingredients B-TARGET
to O
fuse, O
nothing O
sublime O
or O
surprising, O
kindness B-TARGET
a O
long O
way O
x O
ahead, O
not O
to O
repeat, O
to O
highlight O
q O
as O
the O
wine O
chosen O
did O
not O
like O
us O
changed O
it O
without O
cost O

It O
is O
not O
a O
comment O
to O
the O
restaurant O
what O
I O
want O
to O
do, O
but O
an O
appreciation O
to O
your O
comment. O

You O
say O
that O
for O
that O
price O
you O
have O
to O
eat O
well. O

I O
believe O
that O
in O
any O
place O
that O
you O
serve O
meals O
you O
have O
to O
eat O
well O
they O
charge O
you O
what O
they O
charge O
you, O
or O
is O
it O
that O
with O
a O
cheap O
price O
it O
is O
justified O
that O
you O
put O
something O
incomprehensible? O

My O
opinion O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
scam. O

If O
they O
serve O
potato O
cake O
it O
has O
to O
be O
good O
you O
pay O
2 O
euros O
or O
you O
pay O
100, O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
price O
will O
be O
due O
to O
other O
factors O
such O
as O
professionality, O
number O
of O
tables O
per O
waitress, O
decoration O
of O
the O
local O
and O
other O
factors O
external O
to O
the O
meal O
properly. O

Congratulations O
and O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
criticism. O

Yes O
Manolo, O
you O
are O
right, O
I O
have O
not O
explained O
myself O
well, O
I O
wanted O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
low O
price O
as O
to O
be O
able O
to O
give O
everything O
for O
“good”, O
that O
you O
have O
to O
demand O
a O
little O
more. O

and O
a O
greeting. O

Please O
remove O
it O
from O
the O
list, O
as O
it O
has O
been O
closed O
a O
month O
ago. O

A O
shame O

better O
the O
jamon B-TARGET
instead O
of O
sidreria O
would O
put O
jamoneria, O
in O

life O
take O
better O

Both O
for O
pleasure O
and O
for O
work, O
I O
have O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
a O
few O
times. O

It O
stands O
out O
in O
everything O
it O
offers O
and O
does O
so O
outstandingly O
with O
meat B-TARGET
and O
fish. B-TARGET

Absolutely O
recommended. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
professional O
restaurants B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
restaurants B-TARGET
in O
Zaragoza. O

I O
have O
visited O
it O
on O
several O
occasions O
and O
I O
must O
highlight O
the O
excellent O
quality O
of O
the O
raw O
material B-TARGET
and O
the O
knowledge O
to O

Reserve O
and O
I O
was O
eating O
with O
a O
good O
friend. O

We O
let O
us O
be O
guided O
and O
they O
offered O
us O
enters O
to O
share O
some O
baccarat O
buckwheels O
with O
alioli O
of O
membrillo O
and O
some O
calamars O
to O
the O

of O

and O
a O

Everything O
is O
great. O

I O
asked O
the O
head O
of O
the O
room O
that O
the O
chef O
put O
more O
cane O
on O
the O
cloth O
with O
merluza O

He O
did O
so O

Rioja B-TARGET
(divine O
and O
of O
an O
“excellent” O
harvest). O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
safest O
values O
of O
Catalan O
cuisine O
in O
Barcelona. O

He O
is O
always O
excellent O
in O
his O
food B-TARGET
and O
perfect O
in O
his O
service. B-TARGET

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
also O
wonderful. O

You O
cannot O
ask O
for O
more. O

I O
had O
not O
been O
there O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
the O
experience B-TARGET
was O
very O
disappointing. O

Extremely O
expensive O
for O
the O
type O
of O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Oily O
croquettes, B-TARGET
insulse O
marinated B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
scarcely O
transparent O
slices, O
strawberries B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
hard O
strawberries O
and O
strawberries O
when O
the O
price O
of O
the O
dish O
was O
28€, O
the O
rape B-TARGET
carpaccio I-TARGET
testimonial. O

The O
treat O
of O
the O
maitre B-TARGET
that O
took O
us O
note O
was O
of O
very O
little O
professionality O
impressive O
and O
rubbing O
the O
bad O
education. O

Since O
I O
discovered O
it O
a O
few O
years O
ago, O
whenever O
I O
go O
to O
Barcelona, O
I O
go O
to O
l’olivé. O

I O
love O
it. O

A O
very O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
more O
than O
acceptable. O

Something O
expensive O
but O
definitely O
very O
recommended O
to O
eat O
well O
in O
Barcelona. O

I O
prefer O
not O
to O
comment O
on O
the O
disappointment O
I O
had. O

I O
started O
the O
day O
with O
good O
feet O
and O
continued O
choosing O
the O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat, O
chat O
with O
friends O
and O
be O
very O
well O
served. O

The O
local B-TARGET
helps O
you O
get O
to O
exchange O
ideas O
with O
those O
you O
share O
the O
table O
given O
the O
low O
tone O
in O
which O
the O
beginners O
keep O
their O
conversations. O

The O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

Attentive, O
educated, O
discreet, O
all O
who O
attended O
us O
and O
at O
our O
farewell O
came O
to O
give O
us O
the O
last O
farewell O
and O
the O
"until O
the O
next..." O
We O
promised O
to O
return O
but O
that O
time O
with O
many O
more O
friends O
to O
whom, O
previously, O
we O
would O
have O
informed O
of O
that O
lunch O
that O
rounded O
us O
a O
unforgettable O
Saturday. O

and O
thanks. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
had O
already O
been O
in O
the O
previous O
one O
on O
the O
mountain O
street. O

This O
is O
much O
more O
elegant, O
the O
very O
correct O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
the O
ambiance O
makes O
you O
feel O
very O
comfortable. O

The O
quality O
food. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
the O
dressed B-TARGET
socks. I-TARGET

We O
will O
definitely O
repeat. O

Great O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
food. B-TARGET

But O
the O
woman O
who O
is O
in O
the O
box B-TARGET
that O
was O
who O
received O
us O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
spoke O
to O
us O
in O
Catalan O
even O
realizing O
that O
we O
did O
not O
understand O
it. O

I O
felt O
very O
badly O
since O
I O
never O
had O
that O
problem O
in O
Barcelona O
and O
this O
has O
had O
an O
impact O
on O
my O
evaluation O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
ate O
pretty O
well. O

The O
first B-TARGET
good O
meat. B-TARGET

It’s O
closer O
to O
the O
45 O
than O
to O
the O
30 O
euros. O

The O
exquisite O
treatment. B-TARGET

It O
is O
noted O
that O
they O
have O
been O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
and O
lack O
a O
bit O
of O
shooting, O
but O
they O
are O
looking O
forward O
to O
pleasing O
to O
win O
the O
clientele. O

If O
they O
do O
not O
lower O
the O
guard, O
they O
may O
work. O

I O
wish O
you O
good O
luck. O

PD: O
It O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Darín’s O
film, O
only O
that O
they O
liked O
the O
name. O

They O
should O
check O
the O
rations B-TARGET
they O
serve: O
they O
are O
really O
scarce!! O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
service, B-TARGET
only O
pick O
the O
already O
mentioned; O
very O
"minimalist" O
rations. B-TARGET

This O
is O
why O
I O
don't O
give O
a O
10 O
in O
"quality-price", O
although O
the O
quality O
is O
excellent. O

I O
went O
to O
Aragon O
to O
eat. O

The O
reservation O
without O
any O
problem, O
the O
attention B-TARGET
immeasurable, O
asking O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
in O
order O
and O
the O
point O
of O
the O
food. O

All O
the O
dishes, B-TARGET
all O
the O
dishes, O
very O
good. O

And O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
decorated, O
simple O
but O
elegant. O

We O
ate O
a O
menu O
that O
was O
25 O
euros, O
but O
with O
a O
supplement O
for O
some O
dishes. O

My O
accompanying O
a O
onion B-TARGET
soup, I-TARGET
which O
texture O
and O
taste O
were O
very O
good, O
but O
it O
seemed O
little, O
because O
in O
a O
few O
tablespoons O
it O
just O
eaten O
immediately. O

And O
second O
merluza B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
green I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
which O
were O
few O
pieces, O
but O
of O
first O
quality O
and O
very O
good. O

Although O
I O
was O
grateful O
that O
they O
were O
not O
very O
large O
amounts, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
is O
usually O
eaten O
at O
home. O

I O
ordered O
foie B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
roasted, I-TARGET
that O
the O
amount O
was O
more O
than O
correct, O
although O
there O
were O
few O
roasted O
for O
the O
amount O
that O
was O
foie. O

Very O
good O
taste O
anyway. O

And O
the O
second, O
palletilla B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ternasco, I-TARGET
of O
the O
size O
of O
a O
scarce O
pelin O
(was O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
round) O
and O
very O
rich. O

However, O
I O
am O
eating O
a O
lot, O
it O
gave O
me O
the O
feeling O
of O
eating O
little. O

We O
both O
ordered O
dessert, O
melocotón O
de O
Calanda. O

Very O
good O
with O
lemon O
ice O
cream. O

What O
makes O
me O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
eaten O
too O
little. O

Something O
I O
didn’t O
get O
hungry, O
but O
the O
rations B-TARGET
were O
small O
compared O
to O
the O
price. O

I O
thought O
they O
were O
with O
our O
rations, O
but O
it’s O
not O
so. O

I O
saw, O
for O
example, O
a O
plate O
of O
green B-TARGET
Jews I-TARGET
that O
was O
a O
very O
small O
amount O
that O
were O
the O
neighboring O
comensals O
that O
we O
had O
by O
our O
side. O

After O
trying O
out O
several O
restaurants, O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
disappointed. O

I O
know O
that O
you O
can O
not O
compare O
the O
Aragonia O
with O
the O
Chema O
cellar, O
the O
Asador O
Broto O
or O
the O
Filoxera, O
but O
instead O
with O
the O
DGusta O
in O
Utebo O
I O
got O
much O
more O
saturated O
and O
with O
the O
feeling O
of O
having O
eaten O
more O
and O
for O
a O
similar O
price. O

That O
is, O
a O
restaurant, O
when O
you O
are O
satisfied, O
you O
want O
to O
come O
back. O

This O
has O
happened O
to O
me, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
the O
case O
with O
Aragon. O

It O
is O
very O
well O
the O
place, B-TARGET
greatly O
presented, O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
good O
products B-TARGET
and O
top O
quality, O
but O
quantities B-TARGET
in O
my O
view O
scarce, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
eating O
a O
lot. O

and O
salutations. O

We O
dined O
very O
well, O
the O
menu O
is O
small, O
the O
attention B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
very O
welcoming, O
the O
500cc B-TARGET
bottle I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
is O
scarce O
for O
dinner. O

It O
is O
the O
only O
remarkable, O
should O
be O
750cc,Good O
quality-priceI O
recommend O
it O

I O
had O
dinner O
this O
past O
Saturday O
and O
I O
have O
to O
congratulate O
both O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
served O
us O
and O
of O
course O
the O
food. B-TARGET

A O
very O
nice O
site, B-TARGET
well O
served, O
very O
nice O
staff, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
well O
served O
and O
unforeseen O
and O
the O
charming O
site. B-TARGET

We O
will O
return. O

(The O
cupcake B-TARGET
was O
delicious) O

and O
acceptable. O

The O
jamon B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
cut O
and O
of O
good O
quality. O

The O
rest O
are O
read O
entries. B-TARGET

It O
is O
possible O
to O
improve O
the O
ribs, B-TARGET
since O
ribs O
are O
announced O
and O
chulettes O
are O
included. O

Well O
together. O

Service B-TARGET

environment B-TARGET
very O
pleasant, O
really O

we O
can O
repeat O
for O
sure.As O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
quality O
good O
price O
relationship, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
well O
served O
and O
with O
enough, O
we O
did O
not O
get O
hungry, O
we O
were O
three O
people.Only O
to O
comment O
that O
for O
sure O
at O
the O
time O
that O
they O
were O
almost O
5 O
in O
the O
afternoon, O
the O
brases B-TARGET
do O
not O
have O
to O
be O
in O
their O
point O
since O
both O
the O
cow B-TARGET
entrecot I-TARGET
and O
the O
ternasco B-TARGET
did O
not O
have O
the O
presence O
of O
is O
first O
heat O
stroke O
that O
puts O
them O
doraditos. O

They O
were O
good, O
but O
I O
ate O
better O
braises. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it O
and O
put O
it O
among O
my O
favorites. O

Yesterday O
we O
celebrated O
the O
Communion O
of O
our O
daughter, O
it O
was O
a O
rainy O
day, O
but O
it O
doesn’t O
matter O
because O
the O
preparations O
were O
excellent, O
both O
in O
the O
local B-TARGET
and O
in O
the O
rest, O
the O
attention B-TARGET
of O
the O
camarers O
was O
outstanding O
the O
food O
was O
all O
great. O

This O
is O
the O
second O
celebration O
that O
I O
have O
to O
spend O
in O
the O
town. O

Good O
service, O
good O
service, B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
arrived O
at O
its O
point. O

Unfortunately O
the O
weather O
did O
not O
allow O
us O
to O
enjoy O
the O
extraordinary O
terraces O
that O
the O
establishment O
has. O

Today O
I O
went O
out O
to O
dinner O
with O
my O
parents O
and O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
the O
most O
common O
compared O
to O
the O
price, O
45€ O
per O
person. O

I O
think O
that O
in O
those O
prices O
you O
have O
to O
be O
more O
demanding O
both O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
menu O
and O
above O
all O
in O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Less O
experienced O
and O
unprepared O
for O
the O
price O
paid. O

I O
will O
not O
return. O

The O
site B-TARGET
is O
very O
welcoming O
and O
quality O
relationship O
price O
miy O
well. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it. O

I’m O
not O

about O

the O

The O
best O

We O
were O
on O
the O
14th O
of O
January, O
we O
asked O
to O
the O
letter, O
with O
water, O
wine O
of O
middle O
range. O

The O
local B-TARGET
likes O
the O
entrance O
but O
does O
not O
get O
to O
be O
welcoming, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
what O
matters O
to O
me, O
I O
fix O
more O
on O
the O
room O
and O
kitchen O
service.the O
room O
service, B-TARGET
correct, O
(only O
that, O
a O
person O
is O
missing, O
for O
the O
price O
that O
is O
paid). O

the O
bread B-TARGET
: O
scarce O
in O
its O
varieties, O
and O
very O
simple, O
without O
any O
kind O
of O
flavors, O
flour O
or O
fruit.we O
started: O
the O
water, B-TARGET
we O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
any O
rare, O
because O
nobody O
gave O
us O
the O
option, O
they O
took O
us O
the O
water O
bottled O
in O
plastic O
(uncomprehensible). O

We O
started O
with O
a O
cold B-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
apple O
crushes, O
scarce, O
would O
result O
too O
much, O
(of O
shame) O
would O
take O
30 O
grams O
of O
foie, O
you O
say O
correctly; O
egg B-TARGET
poche I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
bogavante I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
trigueros, I-TARGET
correctly, O
sufficient O
amount, O
but O
like O
all O
the O
food, O
flat,insulsa, O
without O
flavors. O
iberic B-TARGET
presa, I-TARGET
ration O
just, O
but O
tasty, O
as O
I O
have O
commented O
before O
all O
soso O
(we O
are O
people O
who O
never O
add O
salt O
to O
the O
meals O
in O
all O
these O
restaurant) O
merluza, B-TARGET
an O
impressive O
ration, O
both O
in O
size O
and O
at O
the O
point O
of O
cooking, O
sosa O
also, O
but O
recommended. O

The O
desserts, B-TARGET
do O
not O
bring O
anything O
new, O
simple, O
good O
but O
nothing O
more.to O
the O
cafes, B-TARGET
nothing O
of O
pettite O
four, O
(lamentable O
for O
175 O
€ O
of O
two O
people, O
without O
charging O
us O
the O
cafes). O

Called O
by O
fame O
and O
Michelin O
star O
we O
went O
to O
eat O
at O
the O
Bal O
d’Onsera. O

We O
had O
the O
idea O
of O
ordering O
the O
menu O
and O
so O
we O
did. O

The O
first O
surprise O
was O
that O
we O
were O
not O
asked O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
take O
an O
appetizer, O
but O
what O
surprised O
us O
most O
was O
that O
when O
asking O
for O
water B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
gas I-TARGET
they O
told O
us O
that O
they O
had O
not O
been O
finished. O

It O
seemed O
unforgivable O
for O
a O
restaurant O
with O
aspirations. O

Everything O
consisted O
of O
having O
gone O
out O
a O
moment O
to O
any O
supermarket O
to O
buy. O

Very O
poor O
organization.For O
this O
moment O
we O
were O
already O
able O
to O
accommodate O
ourselves O
in O
the O
chairs, B-TARGET
very O
modern O
but O
difficult. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
eight O
dishes: O
an O
aperitif, O
3 O
entrances, O
2 O
seconds O
and O
two O
desserts. O

The O
most O
notable O
for O
me O
were O
the O
excellent O
vegetables B-TARGET
that O
accompanied O
all O
the O
dishes, O
with O
short O
and O
adjusted O
cooking O
points, O
very O
in O
the O
line O
of O
Martín O
Berasategui. O

The O
work O
in O
this O
regard O
is O
extraordinary. O

The O
tomato B-TARGET
texture I-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty, O
although O
the O
foam B-TARGET
was O
somewhat O
tough. O

The O
asparagus, B-TARGET
the O
green B-TARGET
juveniles, I-TARGET
the O
cream B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
coliflor, I-TARGET
the O
broccoli, B-TARGET
all O
very O
well O
treated. O

The O
very O
balanced O
combinations, B-TARGET
the O
least O
said O
was O
the O
tomato B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
marinated I-TARGET
tuna, O
but O
the O
bogavante B-TARGET
and O
especially O
the O
poché B-TARGET
egg, I-TARGET
much O
better. O

Eggs B-TARGET
are O
repeated O
in O
the O
first O
three O
plates. O

The O
merluza B-TARGET
well-pointed, O
though O
a O
little O
soaked, O
gave O
way O
to O
what O
for O
me O
was O
the O
surprise O
of O
the O
day, O
a O
piece O
of O
chuletón B-TARGET
exquisite O
of O
flavor O
and O
in O
its O
just O
point O
of O
cooking O
that O
left O
me O
with O
lust O
for O
more.The O
desserts B-TARGET
approved O
justito, O
the O
first O
around O
red O
wine, O
with O
a O
ice B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
for O
me O
too O
dominated O
by O
cinnamon O
and O
with O
a O
foam B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
again O
too O
consistent. O

Here O
is O
a O
variety O
of O
textures O
of O
melocotone O
with O
moscatel. O

Another O
negative O
point O
in O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
that O
he O
tried O
to O
take O
a O
sweet O
wine O
and O
the O
response O
was O
disappointing. O

On O
the O
first O
occasion O
they O
told O
me O
that O
they O
had O
“a O
moscatel O
and O
two O
others O
that O
I O
have O
forgotten O
the O
name.” O

At O
the O
end O
I O
could O
take O
a O
cup O
of O
Pedro O
Ximénez.With O
the O
coffee, B-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
good, O
there O
was O
no O
accompaniment, O
poor, O
very O
poor O
for O
this O
level O
of O
restaurant. O

The O
wine O
with O
which O
we O
accompanied O
the O
meal O
was O
an O
Atteca B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Calatayud, I-TARGET
recommendation O
of O
the O
house, O
excellent. O

As O
a O
curiosity, O
the O
bottle O
labeled O
only O
in O
English O
and O
French!In O
short: O
very O
good O
technical O
level, O
mastery O
of O
the O
cooking O
points O
and O
great O
professionalism O
in O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
aesthetically O
modern O
but O
quite O
conservative O
combinations B-TARGET
in O
terms O
of O
flavors O
- O
except O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
vegetables. B-TARGET

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
all O
prices O
include O
VAT, O
which O
should O
be O
mandatory. O

Defects: O
The O
quantities B-TARGET
are O
too O
small. O

In O
desserts B-TARGET
the O
absence O
of O
chocolate O
seems O
to O
me O
personally O
unforgivable, O
but O
that O
is O
already O
a O
personal O
matter. O

The O
worst O
thing O
for O
me O
is O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
justly, O
with O
some O
serious O
failure O
like O
that O
of O
water B-TARGET
or O
sweet B-TARGET
wine, I-TARGET
it O
was O
not O
at O
the O
height O
of O
a O
star. O

In O
general O
I O
expected O
more, O
it O
is O
still O
very O
far O
from O
Las O
Torres O
or O
Lillas O
Pastia O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
below O
other O
starless O
Zaragoza O
restaurants. O

Thank O
you O
Pedro O
for O
this O
synthesis O
of O
your O
visit O
to O
the O
restaurant O
Bal O
d’Onsera, O
I O
am O
with O
you O
that O
a O
high-level O
restaurant O
is O
something O
more O
than O
a O
good O
kitchen, O
it O
must O
be O
accompanied O
by O
many O
other O
services O
such O
as O
having O
products O
such O
as O
sweet O
wines O
or O
water O
with O
gas O
as O
well O
as O
you O
comment. O

I O
ate O
on O
Tuesday, O
as O
usual. O

Faithful O
to O
my O
tradition O
at O
this O
restaurant, O
I O
did O
not O
ask O
and O
let O
them O
give O
me O
food O
and O
drink. O

Congratulations O
to O
Bal O
D’Onsera O
for O
keeping O
his O
Michelin O
star O
in O
2010 O
and O
I O
regret O
that O
they O
have O
taken O
it O
away O
from O
the O
Lillas O
Pastia. O

Now O
it O
is O
worth O
taking O
a O
look O
at O
the O
comments O
or O
criticisms O
of O
the O
“culinary O
experts.” O

I O
wish O
there O
were O
more O
Michelin-starred O
restaurants O
in O
Zaragoza; O
it O
would O
be O
very O
good O
for O
everyone! O

Mother O
of O
mine O
that O
disproportionate O
chronicle, O
and O
a O
few, O
look O
that O
I O
was O
not O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
Ball O
D’Onsera, O
nor O
did O
I O
understand O
that O
they O
granted O
him O
the O
Michelin O
star, O
I O
have O
to O
have O
a O
terrible O
lack O
of O
criterion, O
or O
enter O
with O
prejudices O
a O
flower O
of O
skin O
to O
evaluate O
it O
with O
two O
slices, O
and O
more O
after O
qualifying O
the O
dishes O
as O
subtle, O
beautiful, O
refreshing, O
excellent O
or O
daring, O
most O
of O
them. O

By O
the O
way, O
anecdotally, O
you O
hardly O
say O
why O
one O
of O
the O
dishes O
was O
left O
untouched, O
if O
it O
was O
because O
it O
was O
incomestible, O
or O
some O
had O
a O
special O
aversion O
to O
the O
turtle, O
that O
said O
be O
of O
passage, O
if O
I O
return O
a O
dish, O
the O
last O
thing O
I O
want O
is O
above O
having O
to O
give O
explanations, O
if O
I O
think O
it O
is O
convenient O
to O
give, O
I O
will O
give O
them O
by O
my O
own O
initiative. O

PD: O
I O
suppose O
that O
this O
restaurant O
will O
not O
weigh O
you O
in O
the O
rating O
not O
being O
in O
the O
center O
as O
the O
Novodabo O
(as O
much O
as O
it O
weighed O
Cachirulo O
or O
the O
Dgusta, O
say O
to O
pass). O

PD2: O
All O
restaurants O
cost O
them O
the O
same O
wine, O
but O
not O
all O
keep O
it O
the O
same, O
not O
all O
have O
the O
same O
means O
(and O
costs) O
for O
its O
conservation, O
nor O
for O
its O
service, O
nor O
have O
a O
wide O
offer O
(and O
immobilized) O
to O
be O
able O
to O
satisfy O
the O
most O
demanding O
customers O
in O
this O
section, O
not O
all O
have O
the O
same O
concern O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
having O
qualified O
and O
trained O
staff, O
attentive O
to O
go O
to O
courses O
and O
events O
to O
give O
this O
section O
the O
importance O
that O
there O
is O
who O
gives O
it, O
which, O
of O
course, O
is O
quite O
away O
from O
demanding O
Aragonese O
cavas O
in O
the O
letter, O
which O
is O
mostly O
like O
asking O
for O
tortoise O
in O
the O
letter. O

I’m O
glad O
you O
didn’t O
like O
the O
story O
or O
some O
of O
the O
others. O

That O
indicates O
to O
me O
that O
I O
am O
going O
on O
the O
right O
line, O
in O
that O
of O
not O
selling O
myself O
to O
the O
easy O
populism O
of O
praising O
the O
model O
restaurants. O

Precisely O
in O
this O
article O
I O
have O
tried O
to O
explain O
why O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
evaluate O
dishes O
very O
well, O
for O
example, O
without O
being O
incongruent O
with O
a O
negative O
final O
evaluation O
of O
my O
visit, O
it O
seems O
that O
I O
have O
not O
achieved O
it, O
I O
have O
even O
put O
a O
simple O
formula, O
linear O
to O
not O
liar O
more. O

I'm O
sorry O
I O
can't O
explain O
it O
more O
clearly, O
however O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
of O
the O
intelligence O
of O
the O
readers, O
which O
is O
much O
higher O
than O
what O
some O
think.Some O
dates O
ago O
I O
commented O
on O
the O
value O
of O
the O
stock O
of O
wine, O
that O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
it, O
but O
as O
in O
life O
it O
has O
a O
few O
limits, O
I O
will O
not O
repeat O
myself. O

I O
want O
to O
think O
that O
you O
are O
not O
Aragonese O
when O
you O
compare O
the O
cava O
of O
Aragon O
to O
the O
tintor O
(who O
doesn’t O
know O
very O
well O
in O
what O
sense O
he O
says O
it, O
but O
it O
seems O
contemptuous). O

Do O
we O
not O
have O
the O
right O
of O
the O
Aragonese O
to O
defend O
ours, O
I O
say O
yes, O
and O
anyone O
who O
despise O
it, O
at O
least O
one O
servant, O
will O
not O
be O
smiled. O

If O
you O
just O
stopped O
to O
evaluate O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
stock, O
we O
barely O
started. O

If O
you O
think O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
Aragonese O
cava O
is, O
enophilically O
speaking, O
infime, O
it O
is O
a O
proof O
that O
I O
am O
not O
Aragonese, O
you O
do O
not O
continue, O
and O
if O
you O
consider O
that O
the O
gastronomy O
“pichi” O
(by O
using O
a O
description O
that O
you O
yourself O
use) O
of O
which O
the O
Bal O
is O
an O
exponent, O
is O
populist, O
you O
do O
not O
end. O

The O
formula O
without O
quoting O
the O
coefficients O
or O
criteria O
to O
be O
evaluated O
serves O
me O
rather O
little, O
that O
by O
the O
way, O
I O
hope, O
you O
have O
had O
the O
decency O
to O
apply O
to O
the O
gastronomic O
result O
of O
the O
dishes O
a O
coefficient O
of O
weight. O

And O
by O
the O
way, O
when O
something O
is O
done O
well, O
I O
will O
be O
the O
first O
to O
defend O
it, O
but O
God O
frees O
me O
from O
defending O
something O
simply O
because O
“it’s O
our,” O
which O
I O
think O
is O
a O
weak O
favor O
to O
“our.” O

Anonymous O
I O
find O
myself, O
and O
how O
did O
you O
come O
to O
such O
conclusions, O
because O
I O
do O
not O
use O
the O
majuscules O
in O
a O
gentile? O

I O
repeat, O
if O
you O
do O
not O
give O
the O
respective O
parameters O
to O
rate O
(the O
Px O
you O
say), O
and O
the O
weight O
of O
each O
one O
(Cx), O
the O
formula O
is O
not O
explained O
or O
serves O
nothing. O

Come O
go, O
scale O
value, O
and O
make O
them O
public O
to O
know O
how O
you O
get O
to O
value O
the O
restaurant O
with O
2/5 O
slices, O
even O
despite O
valuing O
the O
kitchen O
so O
well. O

It’s O
not O
that O
hard, O
p. O

done O
(example), O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
teach O
your O
shame, O
and O
phobias... O

Congratulations, O
now O
you O
understand O
it. O

Luis O
that O
you O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
dinner, O
and O
Jose, O
keep O
on O
your O
line O
that O
we O
love. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant, O
I O
will O
go O
to O
the O
safe O
and O
I O
will O
stay O
at O
La O
Matilde... O

Peter, O
you O
have O
to O
have O
your O
own O
criterion, O
to O
value O
the O
recommendations O
in O
their O
proper O
measure, O
as O
what O
they O
are, O
personal O
impressions, O
and O
not O
to O
be O
afraid O
to O
try, O
and O
even O
to O
be O
disappointed. O

It O
won’t O
be O
the O
first O
time O
I’ve O
come O
out O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
a O
no-recommendation, O
and O
that O
at O
times O
they O
were O
confident. O

But O
there O
each O
with O
his O
acts O
of O
faith, O
blind O
or O
not. O

It O
is O
not O
for O
nothing, O
but O
look O
at O
how O
you O
do O
harm O
to O
the O
presumed O
prescriptors, O
with O
your O
presumed O
experience O
and O
your O
presumed O
good O
taste. O

Just O
by O
comparing O
your O
writings, O
you O
spend O
forty-eight O
euros O
on O
a O
lambrusco, O
a O
pizza, O
a O
little O
pasta O
and O
two O
ice O
cream O
balls O
and O
put O
it O
in O
four O
slices. O

You O
eat O
a O
few O
dishes O
that O
you O
won’t O
make O
in O
your O
life O
and O
put O
them O
in O
two. O

Please, O
if O
you O
are O
ashamed, O
stop O
writing O
nonsense O
and O
hurting O
with O
all O
the O
dignity O
of O
the O
world O
and O
go O
home O
to O
make O
some O
macarons O
of O
those O
that O
you O
like O
so O
much. O

Friend O
Jose O
Aranda, O
if O
something O
negative O
I O
have O
to O
comment O
on O
your O
criticisms, O
it O
should O
be O
you. O

In O
order O
to O
take O
care O
of O
spelling O
a O
bit O
more, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
he O
gives O
some O
paths O
to O
it, O
I O
hope O
that O
by O
“material” O
error O
when O
writing O
and O
not O
by O
ignorance O
of O
language. O

As O
for O
the O
main O
issue, O
the O
criticisms O
themselves, O
seem O
courageous, O
and O
in O
addition, O
in O
most O
cases, O
they O
coincide O
with O
my O
opinion, O
from O
which O
I O
deduce O
that O
in O
addition O
to O
having O
the O
same O
tastes O
and O
criteria O
is O
you. O

A O
honest O
and O
honest O
person. O

Keep O
going, O
say O
what O
you O
think, O
don’t O
sell O
to O
“marketing” O
or O
to O
the O
currents O
of O
opinion O
in O
boga, O
many O
will O
thank O
you. O

A O
cordial O
greeting. O

by O
P.S. O

I O
was O
also O
disappointed O
by O
the O
restaurant, B-TARGET
and O
what O
is O
worse, O
they O
served O
us O
a O
mere B-TARGET
almost O
raw O
that O
had O
not O
been O
frozen O
previously, O
consciously O
breaking O
the O
current O
norm O
on O
this O
(the O
owner B-TARGET
and O
cook B-TARGET
was O
especially O
“proud” O
of O
not O
freezing O
the O
fish). O

What O
a O
pity O
that O
they O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
differentiate O
between O
a O
fish O
cooked O
“at O
its O
point” O
and O
a O
fish O
directly O
raw, O
where O
the O
meat O
does O
not O
break O
off O
the O
spine O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
heat O
and O
cooking. O

And O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
I O
love O
“sushi” O
and O
“sashimi”, O
but O
one O
thing O
is O
a O
specific O
preparation O
meeting O
the O
requirements O
to O
prevent O
the O
intake O
of O
live O
anisakis O
and O
another O
to O
take O
a O
little O
cooked O
wild O
fish, B-TARGET
with O
great O
likelihood O
of O
existence O
of O
active O
parasites. O

What O
a O
pity O
that O
things O
are O
confused, O
there O
is O
nothing O
worse O
than O
a O
poorly O
informed O
“enterado”, O
as O
is O
the O
case O
with O
this O
cook. B-TARGET

Ana, O
Carlos, O
Pedro, O
Anselmo: O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
your O
support. O

Anselmo, O
sorry O
for O
the O
spelling O
errors, O
I O
am O
the O
result O
of O
the O
rush, O
I O
do O
not O
have O
all O
the O
time O
I O
would O
like, O
I O
would O
thank O
you O
will O
report O
me O
any O
error O
you O
find, O
thank O
you. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
coincide O
with O
you O
in O
the O
tastes, O
not O
so O
much O
that O
we O
both O
went O
out O
disappointed O
from O
this O
restaurant, B-TARGET
because O
I O
suppose O
that O
you, O
like O
me, O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
go O
out O
contentedly O
of O
the O
Bal O
d’Onsera, O
recommend O
it O
everywhere O
and O
not O
have O
the O
feeling O
of O
having O
lost O
time O
and O
money, O
at O
least O
I. O

It’s O
not O
easy, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
the O
gastronomic O
“interested”, O
stretching O
them O
out O
Levites, O
mosquitoes, O
shameless O
and O
cowards O
(because O
no O
one O
says O
their O
names, O
surnames O
and O
“position” O
in O
this O
world O
when O
they O
insult) O
who O
write O
comments O
when O
an O
“intruder,” O
like O
me, O
says O
what O
he O
thinks O
freely. O

There O
are O
many, O
very O
many, O
the O
owners O
of O
restaurants O
who O
have O
confessed O
to O
me O
that O
they O
do O
not O
appear O
in O
specialized O
media O
if O
they O
do O
not O
buy O
advertising, O
if O
they O
do O
not O
invite O
the O
listings, O
etc... O
some O
are O
doubled, O
what O
remedy, O
it O
is O
the O
bread O
of O
their O
children, O
others, O
however, O
stoically O
stand O
in O
their O
position O
and O
that O
less O
than O
the O
humble O
customers, O
like O
the O
one O
who O
writes, O
let O
us O
say O
publicly O
that O
they O
also O
have O
good O
tables. O

It O
rarely O
coincides O
with O
one’s O
own O
opinion O
with O
that O
of O
other O
“gastronomic O
critics”, O
but O
rarely O
I O
have O
been O
able O
to O
agree O
more O
than O
with O
D. O
José O
Aranda:My O
wife O
and O
I O
went O
on O
May O
25th O
(March) O
to O
celebrate O
something O
special O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
we O
came O
out O
disappointed. O

We O
asked O
why O
his O
star O
and O
it O
hurt O
our O
pocket. O

(Almost O
the O
worst O
thing O
that O
can O
happen O
to O
you O
in O
a O
restaurant)I O
like O
to O
opinion O
past O
a O
while, O
when O
you O
have O
already O
assimilated O
the O
experience. O

The O
truth O
is, O
I O
don’t O
remember O
any O
dish B-TARGET
from O
the O
tasting O
menu O
that O
we O
take O
(symptomatic). O

When O
you O
go O
to O
a O
place O
of O
these O
you O
expect O
everything O
and O
maybe O
you O
become O
less O
permissive O
than O
with O
others, O
but O
even O
with O
this O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

I O
think O
we O
can O
all O
name O
at O
least O
half O
a O
dozen O
places O
in O
Zaragoza O
where O
to O
eat O
(as O
a O
global O
experience) O
better O
than O
here. O

I O
am O
very O
sorry O
for O
the O
opinion O
that O
you O
have O
of O
this O
restaurant, O
as O
well O
as O
that O
of O
some O
of O
the O
readers O
of O
this O
website. O

I’m O
going O
to O
try O
to O
explain O
why O
your O
star, O
and O
how O
to O
understand O
this O
type O
of O
restaurant O
(something O
that O
with O
all O
respect O
is O
not O
possible O
for O
everyone O
because O
so O
is O
life). O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
is O
that O
I’ve O
been O
4 O
or O
5 O
times, O
but O
given O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
crisis O
I’m O
not O
going O
for O
two O
years, O
not O
because O
I O
don’t O
want O
to, O
but O
because O
I O
can’t. O

But O
having O
said O
this, O
let’s O
start O
commenting O
point O
by O
point: O
– O
THE O
LOCAL: O
For O
tastes O
colors. O

I O
personally O
do O
not O
like O
neither O
the O
street O
nor O
the O
area B-TARGET
of O
Zaragoza O
(I O
should O
be O
more O
central), O
but O
said O
this O
if O
I O
value O
and O
much O
the O
amplitude O
of O
the O
round O
tables B-TARGET
(which O
I O
can O
not O
explain O
from O
the O
economic O
point O
of O
view O
since O
if O
all O
the O
tables O
are O
occupied O
only O
by O
two O
people O
means O
a O
lower O
billing). O

It O
is O
a O
joy O
and O
delight O
to O
have O
a O
table B-TARGET
with O
such O
a O
large O
mantle O
for O
you O
and O
your O
companion. O

This O
effort O
must O
be O
valued O
by O
the O
entrepreneur O
towards O
his O
clients, O
which O
is O
valued O
by O
many O
people. O

– O
THE O
SERVICE: O
You O
say O
that O
you O
didn’t O
empathize O
at O
any O
time O
and O
that O
you O
like O
to O
be O
asked...”So O
look, O
I O
like O
not O
to O
be O
bothered. O

There O
are O
different O
types O
of O
customers, O
those O
who O
like O
to O
be O
taken O
and O
those O
who O
don’t. O

If O
you O
are O
one O
of O
the O
first O
(go O
to O
Palafox O
hotel O
restaurant O
that O
has O
Jesus O
(the O
bigots) O
who O
does O
it O
perfectly). O

I O
and O
many O
people O
like O
to O
eat O
well O
and O
have O
a O
nice O
evening, O
and O
we O
don’t O
like O
to O
be O
interrupted O
by O
interested O
in O
whether O
you O
like O
it, O
if O
it’s O
all O
right, O
if O
you O
want O
something O
more, O
etc. O

If O
you O
have O
gone O
to O
many O
restaurants O
with O
a O
Michelin O
star O
you O
will O
see O
that O
the O
only O
moment O
that O
annoys O
you O
is O
when O
you O
enunciate O
the O
dishes O
at O
the O
time O
of O
serving O
them.Of O
course O
if O
you O
ask O
them O
and O
give O
them O
foot O
then O
they O
answer O
you.But O
to O
what O
we O
go, O
it O
is O
that O
the O
beginners O
enjoy O
their O
evening, O
both O
for O
the O
environment, O
and O
for O
the O
food. O

What O
about O
the O
Sercicio? O

This O
must O
always O
be O
exquisite O
and O
go O
unnoticed. O

If O
so, O
then O
it O
was O
perfect. O

For O
me O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
this O
restaurant O
I O
value O
it O
as O
one O
of O
the O
best O
because O
it O
does O
not O
bother. O

Regarding O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
do O
not O
understand O
when O
you O
speak, O
I O
apologize O
for O
not O
even O
answering O
because O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
it. O

Every O
time O
I O
went O
there O
was O
a O
girl O
with O
short O
black O
hair O
(Spanish) O
and O
the O
cook’s O
wife O
(Carmen). O

Both O
very O
discreet O
as O
required O
in O
this O
type O
of O
establishment. O

- O
THE O
WINE B-TARGET
CARD I-TARGET
: O
Unfortunately O
I O
do O
not O
consider O
myself O
an O
expert O
but O
given O
the O
small O
dimensions O
of O
the O
local, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
very O
good O
card. O

In O
addition, O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
promotion O
of O
the O
best O
wines B-TARGET
in O
our O
region, O
which O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
bet O
on O
them O
as O
much O
as O
this O
restaurant. O

Let O
me O
tell O
you O
that O
it O
can’t O
be O
worth O
the O
same O
wine O
in O
this O
establishment O
as O
in O
any O
other. O

Obviously. O

The O
letter: O
At O
this O
point O
I O
agree O
in O
your O
right O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
menu B-TARGET
tasting. I-TARGET

Here O
is O
where O
the O
cook O
can O
surprise O
us O
and O
delight O
with O
his O
knowing O
how O
to O
do.I O
have O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
the O
first O
time O
surprised O
me O
grately. O

I O
experienced O
different O
sensations O
and O
it O
was O
a O
culinary O
pleasure O
that O
I O
had O
rarely O
experienced. O

Then O
he O
didn’t O
have O
the O
Michelin O
Star O
but O
he O
could O
already O
intuit O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
fall.The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
imaginative, O
modern, O
sophisticated, O
etc. O
What O
left O
him O
hungry? O

I O
do O
not O
believe O
it. O

Anyone O
else O
can O
believe O
it, O
but O
someone O
like O
you?Look, O
I O
know O
people O
who O
go O
to O
Arzak O
and O
say O
the O
same. O

And O
the O
same O
can O
be O
said O
of O
you, O
what O
do O
you O
say? O

Go O
to O
the O
brave O
calamar O
and O
ask O
for O
two O
snacks. O

You O
are O
confused O
by O
place. O

If O
you O
don’t O
like O
it O
you O
have O
the O
WOK O
which O
is O
a O
self-service O
until O
you O
can’t O
do O
more... O
Finally, O
I’ll O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
lacks O
things. O

But O
that’s O
why O
it O
doesn’t O
have O
three O
stars O
and O
only O
has O
one O
star. O

What O
I O
totally O
agree O
with O
you O
about O
is O
the O
wines. O

How O
can O
we O
ask O
for O
a O
wine O
if O
we O
are O
not O
guessing O
the O
dishes O
we O
are O
going O
to O
get O
out O
of O
it? O

As O
for O
the O
price, O
that O
is O
what O
it O
is. O

For O
me O
prohibitive O
these O
days, O
but O
despite O
everything O
I O
don’t O
think O
they O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
because O
there O
are O
only O
five O
tables. O

A O
last O
comment O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
cook B-TARGET
is O
that O
last O
year O
he O
was O
invited O
to O
the O
past O
Expo O
in O
China O
(he O
went O
out O
in O
the O
press), O
and O
the O
dishes O
he O
presented O
in O
the O
Spanish O
week O
were O
typical O
Aragonese O
(drink, O
ternasco... O
and O
all O
with O
Aragonese O
wines). O

Congratulations O
and O
congratulations O
on O
your O
website. O

Gonzalo O

For O
Gonzalo, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
answer O
briefly: O
I O
don’t O
like O
to O
be O
ballooned, O
the O
room O
staff O
also O
doesn’t O
like O
to O
do O
so, O
but O
sometimes O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
recognize O
that O
it O
enters O
its O
“work” O
because O
there O
is O
someone O
who O
likes O
it, O
but O
it O
is O
different O
to O
balloon O
than O
to O
be O
interested O
in O
the O
well-being O
of O
the O
beginners, O
especially O
when O
they O
take O
a O
dish O
enterito O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen, O
a O
“do O
you O
not O
like O
it?”, O
“Is O
it O
all O
right?”, O
when O
collecting O
the O
dishes O
does O
not O
bother, O
it O
is O
not O
ballooning, O
it O
is O
education. O

He O
says O
he O
doesn’t O
believe O
me O
when O
I O
comment O
that O
he O
didn’t O
understand O
the O
person O
who O
brought O
me O
the O
dishes O
when O
he O
presented O
them, O
because O
I O
can O
assure O
him O
that O
the O
girl B-TARGET
didn’t O
speak O
Spanish O
or O
half, O
what O
does O
he O
want O
to O
say O
to O
him, O
if O
he O
wants O
to O
ask O
in O
the O
restaurant O
the O
staff O
they O
had O
for O
those O
dates, O
it’s O
something O
so O
simple O
to O
validate O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
deserve O
more O
words. O

Nor O
is O
it O
believed O
that O
I O
was O
hungry, O
because O
yes, O
I O
was O
hungry, O
and O
I O
like O
when O
I O
am O
going O
to O
eat O
at O
a O
restaurant, O
regardless O
of O
the O
level O
and O
price, O
go O
out O
to O
eat, O
but O
I O
would O
not O
call O
it O
going O
to O
eat... O
we O
could O
say O
we O
go O
to O
a O
kitchen O
exhibition O
at O
the O
restaurant O
Bal O
d’Onsera O
where O
even, O
for O
80 O
euros O
per O
person, O
they O
allow O
us O
to O
try O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
each O
creation?, B-TARGET
but O
that O
yes, O
then O
we O
go O
home O
to O
eat. O

Finally O
I O
would O
like O
to O
thank O
you O
for O
having O
included O
your O
name O
and O
surnames, O
as O
I O
do, O
giving O
the O
face, O
it’s O
great O
to O
have O
different O
points O
of O
view, O
this O
enriches, O
I O
give O
my O
opinion O
and O
you O
yours. O

Unfortunately O
the O
usual O
thing O
is O
that O
people O
on O
the O
internet O
hide O
and O
demonstrate O
their O
cowardice, O
it’s O
not O
their O
case, O
thanks O
for O
their O
frankness. O

I O
am B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
regular I-TARGET
customer I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
this I-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
convinced I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
this I-TARGET
type I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

I O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
negative O
comments O
about O
this O
restaurant. O

Despite O
them, O
Bal O
D’Onsera O
continues O
to O
retain O
its O
Michelin O
star O
(4th O
consecutive O
year O
as O
UNICO O
in O
Zaragoza) O
and O
this O
year O
has O
1 O
Repsol O
sun; O
which O
distinguishes O
it O
as O
UNICO O
retsaurante O
in O
Aragon O
with O
double O
recognition O
by O
the O
2 O
reference O
guides O
of O
gastronomy. O

I O
agree O
with O
Gonzalo O
that O
he O
has O
a O
lot O
to O
go; O
up O
to O
the O
2nd O
and O
3rd O
star O
and O
suns. O

But O
I O
also O
think O
that O
this O
recognition O
should O
reflect O
on O
those O
critical O
voices O
or O
comments, O
which O
can O
also O
be O
mistaken. O

We O
were O
last O
day O
2-3-12 O
eating O
(celebrating O
our O
wedding O
anniversary) O
and O
I O
have O
waited O
a O
few O
days, O
to O
make O
the O
criticism, O
that O
I O
passed O
the O
goat.We O
acquired, O
on O
a O
discount O
web, O
two O
bonuses O
to O
eat O
in O
this O
establishment, O
a O
michelin O
star, O
magnificent! O

The O
result O
could O
not O
have O
been O
more O
disappointing. O

To O
start O
the O
door B-TARGET
looks O
like O
the O
store, O
you O
call O
the O
automatic O
gateway O
and O
they O
open O
you O
(although O
you O
will O
tell O
me O
this O
is O
secondary). O

Once O
inside O
the O
decoration O
is O
as O
I O
would O
like O
my O
wife O
to O
be O
that O
of O
our O
house: O
minimalist.Of O
the O
furniture B-TARGET
just O
say O
a O
couple O
of O
things: O
the O
uncomfortable O
chairs O
and O
the O
tables O
of O
the O
size O
of O
“The O
Mercy”, O
if O
we O
don’t O
approach O
the O
chairs O
to O
each O
other O
it O
looks O
like O
I’m O
eating O
angry O
with O
my O
wife. O

To O
finish O
with O
the O
previous O
before O
entering O
the O
meal O
a O
comment: O
a O
little O
music O
of O
the O
atmosphere O
would O
give O
intimacy, O
you O
hear O
everything O
that O
was O
said O
on O
the O
other O
5 O
tables O
that O
were O
occupied O
(all O
of O
them O
with O
couples O
with O
discount O
coupons O
like O
us). O

Let’s O
start O
with O
the O
menu: O

- O
Carpaccio B-TARGET
de I-TARGET
bonito I-TARGET
: O
It O
would O
be O
beautiful, O
I O
don't O
discuss O
it, O
but O
I O
didn't O
know O
anything, O
totally O
insipid, O
I O
also O
had O
strawberry, B-TARGET
equal O
to O
insipid, O
and O
a O
ice O
cream O
of, O
I O
think O
remember O
that O
of O
mango, O
that O
if O
I O
had O
some O
taste. O

- O
Vieira B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
langostino I-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
saffron O
with O
winter O
vegetables O
: O
If O
you O
observe O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
dish O
is O
in O
singular O
the O
vieira O
and O
the O
langostino O
and O
the O
reason O
is O
not O
another O
that O
there O
was O
one O
of O
each, O
in O
this O
case O
the O
flavors, O
impossible O
to O
eliminate, O
were O
correct, O
the O
saffron O
would O
be, O
but O
neither O
knew O
nor O
saw. O

Bacalao O
to O
the O
airy B-TARGET
pil I-TARGET
pil I-TARGET
: O
No O
objection O
(is O
the O
best O
I O
can O
say). O

The O
foie O
has O
little O
mystery O
a O
sarten O
and O
nothing O
more, O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
spoil O
it, O
now O
the O
risotto O
corrio O
worse O
luck, O
it O
was O
risotto, O
of O
that O
I O
am O
sure, O
why O
I O
saw O
it, O
grains O
of O
rice O
and O
others O
but O
taste, O
that O
if O
very O
intense, O
nata O
and O
only O
nata. O

Glassed B-TARGET
turtle I-TARGET
chariot: I-TARGET
soft O
like O
butter, O
but O
I O
knew O
nothing O
about O
it, O
totally O
insulting. O

- O
Limon, B-TARGET
mango I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
moscatel, I-TARGET
strawberries I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
: O
The O
dessert O
was O
good O
(no O
more).We O
finished O
the O
meal O
with O
a O
Gin O
Tonic O
with O
gourmet O
preparation O
(ponia O
in O
the O
discount O
coupon): O
The O
combined O
came O
out O
prepared O
from O
the O
kitchen. O

I’m O
sorry O
to O
be O
the O
one O
who O
tells O
you O
that O
the O
combinations O
are O
prepared O
on O
the O
table, O
the O
cup O
(or O
whatever, O
in O
this O
case O
a O
cup) O
comes O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
with O
ice O
and O
lemon, O
lime O
or O
whatever O
and O
the O
gin O
is O
served O
in O
front O
of O
the O
customer O
as O
well O
as O
the O
tonic, O
it’s O
not O
by O
suspicion O
it’s O
by O
usual O
practice O
(it O
doesn’t O
happen O
to O
me O
to O
doubt O
the O
ingredients O
but O
it’s O
not O
good). O

Now O
is O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
service B-TARGET
: O
correct O
in O
the O
treatment O
but O
slow O
is O
little, O
between O
dish O
and O
dish O
a O
few O
times O
of O
waiting O
unacceptable.I O
left O
for O
the O
end O
a O
small O
detail, O
for O
some O
without O
importance, O
and O
is O
the O
size O
of O
the O
rations B-TARGET
: O
You O
can O
put O
less O
in O
each O
of O
the O
dishes O
but O
that O
is O
very O
very O
difficult O
(less O
bad O
we O
had O
taken O
the O
snack O
in O
Palomeque O
where O
the O
rations O
are O
generous)With O
all O
this O
my O
opinion O
I O
think O
it O
remains O
clear O
and O
add O
only O
one O
thing O
more: O
I O
went O
out O
feeling O
scammed O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
I O
bought O
two O
bonuses O
in O
Groupalia, O
for O
the O
Restaurant O
of O
a O
Michelin O
Star, O
the O
Bal O
d O
́Onsera, O
at O
49€/person, O
so O
I O
spent O
98€ O
to O
bring O
my O
companion O
to O
dinner, O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occasion. O

It O
seemed O
like O
a O
bet O
on O
insurance, O
“the O
only O
restaurant O
in O
Zaragoza O
with O
Estrella O
Michelín”!! O

It O
was O
an O
indispensable O
appointment, O
so O
I O
announced O
it O
with O
two O
weeks O
of O
time, O
choosing O
a O
Tuesday O
night. O

This O
was O
the O
menu O
that O
appeared O
on O
the O
coupon, O
the O
truth O
that O
had O
very O
good O
pinta:. O

Aperitius O
of O
baccarat O
tartar. O

Gazpacho O
of O
Zaragoza. O

First: O
Contemporary O
salad O
of O
beautiful, O
vegetables O
and O
seasonal O
vegetables. O

Risotto O
of O
saffron, O
vegetables O
and O
seafood. O

Second O
to O
choose: O
Pyrenees O
turtle O
salmon O
with O
red O
pepper O
and O
cream O
potatoes. O

Bacon O
roasted O
with O
tomato O
vinagreta O
and O
drinks. O

Dessert: O
Albericoque, O
sheep O
yogurt, O
caramel O
and O
flavor O
of O
saucer O
flower. O

Degustation O
of O
wine: O
Veraton O

Red O
wine O
from O
the O
D.O. O

of O
Borja. O

100% O
of O
honour. O

Red O
wine O
from O
Calatayud. O

$100 O
in O
white O
light. O

White O
wine O
of O
the O
earth O
(Ayerbe). O

Cava O
Brut O
is O
the O
Marqués O
de O
Gelida O
Reserve. O

of O
organic O
agriculture. O

Well, O
to O
start O
with, O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
and O
we O
were O
the O
first, O
the O
whole O
dining O
room O
for O
us O
alone! O

When O
we O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
table, O
they O
already O
tell O
us O
that O
the O
bullshit B-TARGET
had O
ended O
(beginning O
of O
the O
week, O
first O
to O
get O
to O
dinner, O
with O
a O
menu O
closed O
and O
warning O
with O
two O
weeks O
of O
time....), O
that O
they O
would O
give O
us O
a O
bullshit... O
first O
chasco, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
not O
comparable O
(and O
of O
course, O
it O
wasn’t, O
it O
required O
to O
chew O
it O
a O
lot O
of O
time). O

Following O
by O
warning O
us O
of O
the O
change, O
he O
asked O
us O
if O
a O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
seemed O
good O
to O
us O
to O
start, O
so, O
before O
that O
question, O
I O
commented O
if O
they O
were O
not O
going O
to O
serve O
the O
three O
wines O
that O
appeared O
in O
the O
coupon, O
to O
which O
he O
replied O
that O
one O
of O
the O
cellars, O
did O
not O
supply O
them O
until O
November...something O
that O
to O
me O
personally, O
it O
seems O
great... O
but O
they O
were O
not O
going O
to O
serve O
us!!!, O
since O
they O
had O
considered O
enough O
two O
wines, O
one O
white O
and O
one O
red.. O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
when O
you O
paid O
for O
a O
closed O
menu, O
they O
should O
be O
adjusted O
to O
what O
you O
bought, O
since O
if O
not, O
it O
is O
a O
scam, O
and O
then O
they O
see O
that O
they O
do O
not O
have O
enough O
margin, O
when O
they O
take O
out O
a O
bonus, O
that O
they O
adjust O
the O
menu O
to O
what O
they O
think, O
so O
the O
consumer O
can O
choose O
before O
buying. O

And O
to O
hallucinate. O

Once O
you O
have O
already O
paid! O

Of O
course, O
as O
it O
was O
a O
special O
moment, O
I O
didn’t O
want O
to O
ride O
any O
circus, O
nor O
ask O
the O
complaint O
book, O
but O
the O
feeling O
with O
which O
I O
left O
that O
restaurant B-TARGET
wasn’t O
good, O
I O
felt O
scammed.Finally, O
I O
don’t O
advise O
it O
for O
anything, O
the O
site B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
the O
food B-TARGET
good, O
but O
excessively O
expensive O
for O
what O
it O
really O
is, O
and O
of O
course, O
I O
don’t O
encourage O
anyone O
to O
buy O
coupons O
to O
eat O
there, O
since O
they O
risk O
serving O
them O
what O
they O
consider O
at O
that O
time, O
regardless O
of O
what O
you’ve O
paid O
before. O

I O
was O
yesterday O
on O
February O
22 O
at O
the O
restaurant O
bal O
d’osera O
and O
my O
surprise O
was O
that O
first O
they O
apologize O
because O
they O
still O
don’t O
have O
stools, B-TARGET
then O
the O
tables B-TARGET
also O
tell O
you O
that O
they O
are O
provisional O
(that O
they’t O
have O
opened O
yet, O
if O
they O
couldn’t) O
because O
the O
price O
of O
course O
hasn’t O
lowered O
it. O

For O
me O
with O
this O
reform O
to O
lost O
charm, O
because O
you O
are O
dining O
without O
privacy, O
seeing O
and O
hearing O
the O
people O
that O
are O
in O
the O
bar O
bar. O

With O
this O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
you O
have O
to O
raise O
your O
voice O
to O
hear O
and O
form O
an O
atmosphere B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
what O
is O
expected O
of O
a O
Michelin O
star. O

I O
was O
on O
the O
day O
6-12-08 O
and O
the O
truth O
very O
well; O
the O
environment B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
fasion O
the O
walls O
torally O
white, O
the O
chairs O
very O
modern O
but O
comfortable O
and O
without O
any O
picture. O

We O
asked O
for O
a O
letter O
and O
a O
snack B-TARGET
they O
took O
us O
a O
spoonful O
of O
bacon O
broth O
with O
a O
spoonful O
of O
strawberry O
broth O
and O
almond O
foam, O
the O
truth O
was O
very O
delicate. O

First O
we O
picked O
up O
a O
risotto B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
trophy O
and O
a O
super O
medallon B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fresh I-TARGET
foie I-TARGET
passed I-TARGET
by I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
plank I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
some I-TARGET
drinks I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
centollo I-TARGET
were O
the O
two O
very O
good O
things O
and O
cooked O
to O
the O
tooth.Second O
the O
merluza B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
plank I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
juliana I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
sepia I-TARGET
and O
a O
sausage B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
saffron, O
the O
amerluza O
was O
little O
made O
inside O
but O
hot O
and O
the O
sausage O
little O
made O
too O
and O
with O
very O
little O
sauce;and O
d O
epostre O
a O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
chocolates I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
textures I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
reduced I-TARGET
orange I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
and O
a O
merenge B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
frescoes I-TARGET
;very O
good, O
all O
two O
cafes O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
water O
for O
123 O
euros. O

This O
reservation O
was O
correct. O

The O
price O
quality O
ratio O
is O
very O
good. O

The O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

of O
large O
rations. B-TARGET

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
attentive O
and O
very O
friendly, O
the O
calçotada B-TARGET
menu O
is O
endless! O

The O
best, O
the O
strawberries B-TARGET
(were O
luxurious) O
and O
the O
calçots B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tiles, I-TARGET
beautiful! O

The O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
good. O

They O
had O
a O
detail O
by O
changing O
me O
the O
grilled O
meat O
for O
a O
grilled O
vegetables O
(vegetarian O
option). O

I O
will O
repeat O
for O
sure! O

The O
food B-TARGET
quite O
well O
(quality O
and O
quantity), O
although O
it O
took O
time O
to O
be O
served O
(it O
is O
true O
that O
it O
was O
full, O
the O
local, O
but... O
you O
have O
to O
anticipate O
having O
more O
staff O
or O
taking O
less O
services). O

The O
place, B-TARGET
more O
pleasant O
than O
it O
seemed, O
though O
with O
excessively O
loud O
music O
(difficult O
to O
talk, O
by O
the O
volume O
of O
music O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
comensals). O

Expensive O
for O
the O
whole O
restaurant. B-TARGET

But O
right, O
well O
and O
well. O

Great O
interior B-TARGET
and O
quality O
food. B-TARGET

Careful O
and O
fast O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
recommended O

The O
calçotada B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
as O
far O
as O
the O
meat B-TARGET
was O
concerned, O
it O
was O
somewhat O
scarce O
or O
improved O
in O
quality O
without O
altering O
the O
number O
of O
pieces. O

Great O
place B-TARGET
and O
great O
attention. B-TARGET

Excellent O
Calçotada B-TARGET
menu O

Food B-TARGET
- O
6.5 O
(the O
main O
dish, O
the O
calsots, B-TARGET
were O
costly O
to O
peel O
because O
the O
root O
was O
not O
cut O
and O
its O
quality O
was O
not O
very O
good. O

The O
romesco B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
and O
beef B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
good. O

I O
liked O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
too. O

Service B-TARGET
- O
4 O
(We O
felt O
a O
bit O
invisible O
to O
the O
staff, O
they O
just O
devoted O
themselves O
to O
serving O
the O
food. O

“All O
well? O

“Do O
you O
like O
it?” O

These O
are O
typical O
questions O
that O
I O
found O
missing O
for O
attention. B-TARGET

We O
were O
given O
the O
option O
to O
repeat O
calsots, B-TARGET
it O
is O
always O
a O
detail O
that O
is O
appreciated O
but O
not O
enough O
to O
approve O
the O
service.) O

Environment B-TARGET
- O
9 O
(good O
to O
eat O
a O
calsotada O
in O
pair O
and O
quiet, O
which O
was O
the O
case) O

quality-price O
- O
7 O
( O
the O
product O
calsot B-TARGET
can O
be O
improved, O
the O
meat B-TARGET
very O
correct O
and O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
too O
). O

I O
approve O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
but O
if O
they O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
calsot B-TARGET
it O
is O
recommended O
100% O
to O
make O
a O
calsot O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
Barcelona. O

We O
ate O
very O
well, O
quality O
reasonable O
price. O

Excellent O
service...although B-TARGET
we O
didn’t O
like O
how O
the O
room B-TARGET
boss I-TARGET
pressured O
the O
waiters..they O
don’t O
deserve O
that O
treatment..and O
less O
in O
front O
of O
the O
customers. O

Overall, O
we O
went O
out O
satisfied, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back. O

At O
first O
they O
seemed O
a O
bit O
abrupt O
and O
having O
booked O
they O
were O
going O
to O
give O
us O
the O
worst O
table O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

But O
we O
asked O
them O
to O
change O
us O
and O
from O
there O
everything O
phenomenal. O

Good O
attention B-TARGET
and O
environment. B-TARGET

Excellent O
food, B-TARGET
although O
we O
had O
to O
order O
the O
same O
several O
times O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
coordination O
in O
the O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
well O
in O
general. O

Very O
good O
environment, B-TARGET
very O
nice O
and O
beautiful O
place. B-TARGET

The O
good O
shoes B-TARGET

and O
excellent. O

Proper O
price O
and O
quality. O

Fast O
and O
efficient O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
welcoming O
environment. B-TARGET

We O
liked O
it O
very O
much, O
because O
even O
though O
it O
was O
full O
of O
attention B-TARGET
it O
was O
immeasurable O
and O
fast. O

I O
also O
appreciate O
its O
location, B-TARGET
for O
those O
who O
do O
not O
have O
a O
car O
it O
is O
reached O
very O
easily O
as O
it O
is O
very O
central. O

Congratulations O
to O
you!! O

A O
restaurant O
with O
a O
modern O
atmosphere B-TARGET
where O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
at O
your O
disposal O
and O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
is O
very O
friendly. O

The O
best O
choice O
is O
to O
eat O
there. O

correctly O

We O
ate O
very O
well O
with O
the O
whole O
family, O
the O
entrecot B-TARGET
was O
spectacular. O

The O

of O
the O

A O

We O
were O
a O

celebrating O
birthdays. O

I O
would O
repeat. O

Good O

We O
ate O
calçots O
with O
my O
foreign O
friends, O
at O
night O
and O
in O
Barcelona... O
it O
didn’t O
seem O
the O
best O
way O
to O
introduce O
this O
typical O
Catalan O
event O
to O
my O
friends, O
but O
in O
Balmes/Rossello O
we O
ate O
a O
calçotada B-TARGET
worthy O
of O
the O
best O
masia. O

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
genuine O
brasses, B-TARGET
with O
strawberries B-TARGET
and O
grills. B-TARGET

The O
romesco B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
was O
amazing O
and O
not O
with O
too O
much O
garlic O
you O
repeat O
all O
night O
as O
in O
some O
places! O

Super O
recommended! O

Food B-TARGET
abundant, O
good O
quality-price O
ratio O
if O
you O
ask O
for O
entrance O
+ O
second O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
about O
12 O
euros O

We O
were O
3 O
friends O
to O
eat O
a O
calçotada O
and O
all O
told O
us O
that O
the O
calçotadas O
in O
the O
city O
were O
not O
good, O
that O
we B-TARGET
had O
to O
go O
outdoors, O
but O
I O
love O
it, O
all O
very O
good, O
the O
treat B-TARGET
great, O
they O
taught O
us O
to O
eat O
the O
calçots, O
and O
very O
good O
price, O
I O
definitely O
recommend O
it. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
decent, O
the O
brave B-TARGET
nothing O
spicy O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
poor O
in O
attention. O

The O
Rte O
Balmes- O
Rosello O
we O
love O
for O
its O
service, B-TARGET
location, B-TARGET
bathroom O
and O
comfort. O

All O
outdoors O

bright O
with O
easy O
access. O

Congratulations O
from O
the O

Quality O
and O
Price: O
Excellent O

Repeated O

All O
very O
correct: O
quality-price O
ratio, O
the O
ease O
to O
combine O
menu O
calçotada B-TARGET
with O
letter, O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
very O
well. O

The O
youngest O
comensal O
of O
the O
table O
(20 O
years O
old) O
assured O
that O
he O
would O
return O
on O
his O
own. O

The O
menu O
is O
recommended O
for O
its O
quality-price O
ratio. O

If O
you O
keep O
it, O
we O
will O
repeat O
it O
next O
year! O

I O
went O
with O
some O
Mexican O
friends O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
rare O
to O
do O
a O
calçotade O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
Barcelona, O
but O
the O
experience O
was O
excellent, O
they O
offered O
us O
again O
once O
finished. O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
and O
all O
very O
well. O

Very O
recommended. O

We O
went O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
there O
was O
no O
complaint. O

Very O
good O
food, B-TARGET
a O
very O
well-decorated O
place B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

The O
deal B-TARGET
was O
great O
from O
the O
whole O
team O
but O
in O
general O
we O
were O
lucky O
that O
Mr. O
Jose O
put O
part O
of O
his O
collaboration O
in O
the O
chosen O
menu. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
safe. O

I O
surpassed O
my O
expectations O
and O
the O
price O
was O
good. O

Restaurant O
to O
not O
throw O
rockets O
but O
generally O
you O
are O
satisfied. O

Great O
food B-TARGET
and O
fast O
service. B-TARGET

We O
ate O
two O
very O
good O
menus. O

The O
very O
gentle O
and O
constantly O
pending O
waiters B-TARGET
that O
we O
will O
not O
miss O
anything! O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
seemed O
strange O
was O
that O
they O
didn’t O
have O
the O
Catalan O
cream O
for O
dessert! B-TARGET

(But O
for O
the O
rest, O
I O
highly O
recommend O
it! O

I O
hadn’t O
had O
an O
experience O
in O
which O
nothing O
had O
failed, O
and O
so O
it O
has O
been. O

I O
went O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
my O
mother-in-law O
and O
all O
were O
delighted: O
service, B-TARGET
speed, B-TARGET
cooking B-TARGET
points, I-TARGET
rations, B-TARGET
quality/price, O
only O
two O
pears: O
the O
wine B-TARGET
of O
the O
house O
had O
a O
point O
of O
rancidity O
and O
that O
could O
have O
put O
us O
in O
a O
more O
central O
point O
of O
the O
lounge. O

Totally O
recommended O
for O
a O
distracted O
meal, O
with O
a O
smell O
of O
brasa. O

A O
wide O
list, B-TARGET
rich O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
quality O
price, O
correct O
and O
attentive O
service B-TARGET
and O
very O
animated O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
I O
recommend O
it O
for O
any O
occasion. O

I O
was O
really O
surprised O
because O
I O
had O
never O
gone, O
we O
were O
a O
group O
of O
20 O
people O
and O
it O
was O
great, O
very O
welcoming O
site, B-TARGET
modern O
decoration, B-TARGET
good O
quality O
food... B-TARGET
And O
an O
economical O
price O
to O
be O
Barcelona. O

Totally O
recommended. O

Very O
good O
service B-TARGET
too! O

Very O
careful. O

good O

Attentive O

A O

Well O

A O
lot O
of O

Excellent O
quality/price O
relationship, O
very O
complete O
rations B-TARGET
and O
very O
pleasant O
environment. B-TARGET

The O
perfect O
service. B-TARGET

The O
menu O
is O
very O
good, O
allowing O
to O
repeat, O
good O
quality-price-quality O
ratio. O

Excellent O
quality O
price. O

All O
very O
correct. O

We O
ordered O
the O
calçotada O
menu, O
and O
the O
calçots B-TARGET
left O
much O
to O
be O
desired. O

They O
were O
very O
small O
in O
size O
and O
some O
empty. O

We O
have O
tried O
them O
infinitely O
better O
at O
other O
restaurants. O

I O
will O
not O
come O
back O
for O
that. O

A O
bit O
of O
scarcity... O

We O
were O
2 O
people O
to O
take O
the O
calçotada O
menu O
and O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
as O
well. O

I O
like O
it. O

We O
ate O
very O
well. O

Quality O
and O
quantity. O

We O
were O
three O
adults. O

Reservation O
is O
made. O

Upon O
arrival O
they O
changed O
us O
to O
a O
better O
table O
than O
the O
one O
they O
had O
initially O
booked O
so O
that O
we O
were O
more O
calm. O

Very O
good O
deal B-TARGET
and O
they O
put O
us O
extra O
calçots O
without O
charging O
it. O

Very O
good O
memory. O

and O
perfect. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
visited O
this O
place, O
I O
promoted O
it O
on O
the O
web. O

Looking O
at O
the O
promotion, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
slightly O
misleading, O
as O
far O
as O
the O
price O
of O
the O
letter O
as O
it O
exceeds O
the O
average O
of O
20-30 O
euros O
as O
announced, O
without O
making O
any O
excess. O

3 O
people, O
4 O
rations O
of O
enters O
and O
two O
seconds, O
along O
with O
a O
dessert O
and O
2 O
coffee, O
drinks, O
water O
for O
two O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
wine, O
the O
total, O
exceeds O
30 O
per O
person. O

We O
liked O
the O
place, B-TARGET
very O
nice O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
very O
quiet, O
very O
good O
service. B-TARGET

We O
will O
be O
back O
safely! O

Very O
nice, O
good O
quality O
price O
ratio O
and O
good O
cuisine. B-TARGET

I O
will O
repeat O
for O
sure. O

Good O
environment, B-TARGET
good O
food, B-TARGET
a O
good O
place. B-TARGET

The O
truth O
is, O
everything O
was O
very O
good, O
careful O
service B-TARGET
and O
everything O
as O
expected. O

By O
putting O
some O
trap, O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
calçots I-TARGET
was O
not O
purely O
romesco, O
but O
it O
was O
fine. O

We O
will O
surely O
repeat. O

Good O
food, B-TARGET
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
excellent O
customer O
service. O

We O
went O
for O
the O
calçota O
and O
all O
great O
but O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
disappointed O
us O
quite O
a O
lot O
to O
tomato. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomatoes I-TARGET
serve O
you O
already O
ointed O
and O
I O
also O
do O
not O
convince O
us, O
some O
had O
too O
much O
tomatoes O
and O
I O
personally O
like O
to O
make O
it O
with O
a O
little O
ointed O
garlic. O

Everything O
is O
very O
good, O
the O
price O
is O
very O
good. O

Very O
good O
service, B-TARGET
we O
are O
pleased O
with O
the O
service. O

Very O
attentive O
room O
staff B-TARGET
and O
quality O
and O
well O
cooked O
food. B-TARGET

It’s O
a O
nice O
place, B-TARGET
but O
there’s O
something O
missing. O

We O
went O
my O
partner O
and O
I O
with O
intention O
to O
dinner O
there O
and O
in O
the O
end O
we O
only O
took O
two O
rations. O

He O
lacks O
a O
lot O
of O
education. O

We O
ordered O
a O
portion O
of O
steam B-TARGET
cheeks I-TARGET
that O
were O
unclean O
and O
a O
portion B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
gambas I-TARGET
in O
which O
we O
were O
not O
even O
covered. O

The O
cakes B-TARGET
were O
good O
but O
expensive. O

We O
won’t B-TARGET
go I-TARGET
back, I-TARGET
we O
stayed O
with O
“The O
House O
of O
Sea”. O

I O
have O
been O
several O
times, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
professional O
and O
very O
friendly, O
as O
to O
the O
product, B-TARGET
very O
well O
in O
quality O
and O
quantity, O
no O
surprises O

It O
is O
a O
good O
place, B-TARGET
no O
more. O

The O
price B-TARGET
is O
stable O
and O
you O
don’t O
get O
scared. O

On O
Saturday, O
June O
15, O
we O
were O
at O
this O
restarant O
dinner O
remembering O
good O
and O
bad O
days O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
mangrove. O

I O
treat O
the O
food B-TARGET
correctly, O
unfortunately O
badly, O
from O
a O
crude O
gratinated O
balalao B-TARGET
to O
a O
cattle O
cart B-TARGET
heated O
in O
a O
microwave O
and O
that O
passes O
from O
heating O
to O
dry O
in O
the O
thinner O
parts. O

Until O
ever O
friends, O
who O
are O
lucky O
will O
need O
it. O

I O
stayed O
for O
a O
week O
and O
selected O
an O
executive O
menu. O

First B-TARGET
simple O
quartel O
style O
dish. O

The O
second O
bite B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
contained O
only O
the O
head. O

Return O
to O
the O
kitchen, O
camaraderie B-TARGET
friendliness, O
account O
request O
and O
goodbye. O

I O
hope O
your O
work O
will O
be O
more O
satisfying. O

Bad B-TARGET
taste I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
mouth I-TARGET
after I-TARGET
reading I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
criticisms I-TARGET
especially I-TARGET
for I-TARGET
going I-TARGET
out O
without O
eating. O

There O
are O
many O
menus O
of O
the O
day O
in O
Zaragoza O
that O
have O
no O
comparison O
with O
this O
one. O

Definitely O
a O
disaster. O

Not O
to O
return O

I O
could O
not O
comment, O
but O
the O
truth O
very O
good O
place, B-TARGET
with O
sticky O
dishes. B-TARGET

We O
served O
an O
aperitif, O
roasted O
with O
tomatoes. O

First O
we O
had O
a O
pink B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
good O
to O
share, O
to O
eat O
then O
a O
gruel O
(some O
bit) O
and O
later O
eggs O
with O
foie. O

And O
already O
from O
the O
main O
dish O
we O
ate O
bacon O
with O
ali-oli, O
which O
I O
could O
not O
finish, O
because O
it O
was O
full. O

And O
the O
dessert O
was O
a O
ice O
cream, O
because O
it O
was O
full. O

To O
come O
back, O
of O
course. O

and O
hello. O

I O
was O
at O
the O
restaurant O
on O
September O
12, O
2009. O

The O
site B-TARGET
is O
not O
one O
that O
shines O
with O
its O
luxurious O
decoration O
but O
it O
has O
that O
sobriety O
of O
the O
sites O
that O
they O
know O
they O
don’t O
need. O

The O
possibilities O
at O
the O
restaurant O
are O
fundamentally O
three; O
regular O
card, O
tasting O
menu O
and O
an O
intermediate O
option O
that O
is O
a O
selection O
of O
first O
and O
dessert O
and O
letter O
for O
the O
second. O

This O
was O
our O
choice.In O
addition O
to O
the O
meal O
ordered O
the O
house O
invites O
three O
small O
snacks O
in O
which O
I O
especially O
like O
the O
paté B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
anchoas.The I-TARGET
first O
choice O
of O
the O
chef O
was O
a O
carpa-chio O
of O
pulp, O
a O
bizcocho O
of O
mushrooms O
pecs, O
some O
langostinos O
and O
a O
slice O
of O
scabies. O

Generally O
at O
a O
great O
level O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
that O
were O
individual O
so O
it O
does O
not O
matter O
the O
number O
of O
people O
at O
the O
table O
the O
enters O
will O
be O
the O
same. O

The O
seconds O
of O
the O
table O
were O
a O
solomillo, O
an O
Iberian O
beetle, O
a O
ternasco O
canel O
and O
a O
rapper. O

Both O
the O
salad B-TARGET
(but O
rather O
generous O
the O
piece) O
and O
the O
straw, O
which O
are O
the O
only O
two O
I O
tried O
had O
a O
perfect O
touch O
of O
kitchen O
(as O
asked) O
and O
by O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
beginners O
the O
other O
dishes O
had O
a O
great O
level, O
being O
possible O
that O
the O
canelon B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
ternasco I-TARGET
was O
not O
so O
generous O
the O
ration O
as O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
dishes. O

The O
desserts B-TARGET
were O
again O
a O
tasting O
of O
different O
types O
of O
desserts O
that O
also O
had O
the O
very O
high O
level, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dinner. O

But O
where O
this O
restaurant O
stands O
out O
is O
undoubtedly O
in O
its O
EXTENSISIMA O
cellar B-TARGET
with O
a O
range O
of O
prices O
more O
than O
accessible O
for O
any O
pocket O
since O
there O
are O
countless O
wines O
that O
do O
not O
pass O
the O
20 O
euros O
although O
of O
course O
if O
we O
look O
for O
something O
more O
of O
a O
level O
of O
course O
the O
site O
and O
especially O
its O
sumiller O
respond O
with O
great O
effectiveness O
and O
level. O

And O
not O
only O
is O
it O
the O
great O
variety O
of O
table O
wines B-TARGET
(black, O
white O
or O
cava) O
but O
it O
has O
an O
even O
wider O
variety O
of O
other O
types O
of O
wines O
(smelling, O
bottled, O
PX, O
oportus,...) O
without O
forgetting O
the O
cognac O
and O
other O
liqueurs O
including O
their O
chart O
of O
pures. O

Of O
course O
a O
site O
that O
with O
moderation O
in O
the O
drink O
comes O
out O
for O
about O
55 O
euros O
per O
person, O
but O
that O
if O
you O
want O
to O
give O
a O
tribute O
in O
the O
choice O
of O
the O
drink O
you O
have O
what O
you O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
ask. O

The O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
good, O
it O
is O
a O
very, O
very O
recommended O
menu, O
in O
which O
you O
would O
highlight O
the O
baccarat B-TARGET
really O
tasty O
and O
in O
its O
point, O
and O
dessert. B-TARGET

We O
were O
treated O
phenomenal O
despite O
our O
small O
“faena” O
to O
the O
restaurantem O
since O
of O
ten O
people O
we O
were O
going O
to O
be, O
we O
had O
for O
reasons O
of O
health O
4 O
low O
and O
we O
were O
only O
6. O

Recommend O
and O
repeat O

We O
were O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
in O
January O
and O
we O
were O
quite O
disappointed. O

We O
chose O
a O
closed O
menu O
and O
when O
they O
were O
going O
to O
start O
serving, O
we O
were O
warned O
that O
they O
were O
changing O
the O
cheddar O
black O
rice O
with O
sepia O
for O
a O
cheddar O
rice O
with O
cheddar O
(¡!). O

Although O
we O
cautioned O
a O
person O
that O
chrysanthemum O
didn’t O
like O
it, O
they O
said O
that O
it O
was O
just O
a O
“subtle O
chrysanthemum O
aroma” O
and O
it O
didn’t O
result O
like O
that O
(I O
knew O
the O
chrysanthemum O
to O
potatoes). O

I O
think O
q O
when O
you O
go O
to O
a O
restaurant O
of O
that O
level O
and O
there O
is O
a O
change O
in O
the O
menu, O
you O
should O
be O
warned O
when O
submitting O
the O
letter, O
and O
q O
if O
you O
do O
it O
later, O
you O
should O
give O
options O
to O
change O
the O
dish O
if O
you O
don’t O
like O
some O
comensal. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
did O
not O
seem O
worthy O
of O
a O
restaurant O
level. O

There O
were O
flavors O
that O
should O
be O
secondary O
and O
restore O
quality O
to O
the O
plate. O

I O
refer O
to O
the O
mustard O
brush O
Q O
accompanied O
the O
brush, O
which O
far O
from O
being O
a O
brush, O
was O
a O
lot O
and O
when O
it O
was O
joined O
with O
the O
brush O
and O
potato O
killed O
the O
taste B-TARGET
of O
these O
ingredients, O
they O
were O
the O
protagonists O
of O
the O
dish. O

and O
UI! O

And O
putting O
“stones” O
of O
those O
q O
sell O
in O
tourist O
stores O
as O
an O
accompaniment O
to O
the O
coffee... O
it O
has O
no O
name!! O

It O
is O
great!! O

Everything O
was O
very O
well O

Everything O
is O
correct. O

Good O
environment, B-TARGET
good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
price B-TARGET
quality. I-TARGET

Very O
good O
care B-TARGET
and O
excellent O
selection O
and O
preparation O
in O
the O
dishes. B-TARGET

and O
excellent. O

To O
repeat O
on O
another O
good O
occasion O
that O
it O
deserves. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
at O
Matilde O
in O
August. O

It O
was O
Thursday O
night O
and O
we O
were O
the O
only O
customers O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

We O
chose O
the O
option O
of O
the O
cheapest O
closed O
menu O
for O
4 O
people O
and O
say O
that O
the O
quality-price B-TARGET
of O
what O
we O
got O
was O
poor.The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
an O
appetizer O
of O
anopheles O
that O
was O
actually O
achieved. O

We O
followed O
up O
with O
a O
really O
different O
melon O
entrance O
with B-TARGET
jamon I-TARGET
with O
ice O
cream O
that O
was O
the O
best O
dish O
of O
the O
dinner. O

Then O
we O
passed O
to O
a O
golden B-TARGET
one O
that O
was O
good O
but O
that O
was O
really O
scarce O
in O
quantities. O

It O
would O
not O
be O
a O
small O
gold O
for O
the O
four. O

Then O
we O
put O
3 O
chickens B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
corn O
chicken O
that O
was O
undoubtedly O
the O
worst O
dish. O

The O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
a O
chilindron O
with O
a O
certain O
flavor O
to O
grasp O
and O
the O
strawberries B-TARGET
did O
not O
cease O
to O
be O
that... O
strawberries. O

A O
dish B-TARGET
like O
the O
main O
in O
a O
25-euro O
menu O
doesn’t O
seem O
normal. O

As O
an O
appetizer, O
but O
not O
as O
the O
second O
meat. O

Finally O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
a O
white O
cinnamon O
chocolate O
with O
homemade O
platinum O
ice O
cream O
and O
cookie O
mousse O
that O
was O
just O
right. O

In O
short, O
quality-price B-TARGET
for O
a O
poor O
25-year O
menu O
and O
I O
doubt O
much O
that O
we O
will O
try O
more O
expensive O
menus O
again. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
in O
Zaragoza. O

Both O
for O
its O
history, O
as O
for O
its O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
its O
cellar. B-TARGET

Professional O
and O
close O
service. B-TARGET

The O
effort O
that O
restaurants O
of O
this O
level O
make O
(and O
have O
to O
do) O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
times O
and O
offer O
closed O
menus O
at O
an O
affordable O
price, O
is O
not O
always O
recognized. O

Excellent O
attention B-TARGET
and O
quality B-TARGET

All O
very O
correct O

Very O
rich O
food, B-TARGET
very O
quick O
and O
attentive O
service. B-TARGET

My O
kids O
were O
delighted, O
and O
a O
reasonable O
price O
for O
this O
part O
of O
the O
Ensanche. O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
both O
in O
quality O
and O
service. O

It O
was O
great, O
we O
were O
treated O
very O
well O
and O
good O
quality O
price O
relationship. O

Very O
nice O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
small O
group O
like O
us. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
very O
attentive, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent, O
I O
would O
recommend O
it. O

Great O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
go O
in O
a O
group O
with O
friends O
or O
co-workers! O

Good O
environment, B-TARGET
food, B-TARGET
attention B-TARGET
and O
price!! B-TARGET

The O
only O
disadvantage O
is O
the O
noise... B-TARGET
but O
go... O
all O
great!! O

Excellent O
food, B-TARGET
good O
environment B-TARGET
and O
good O
price. B-TARGET

Abundant O
but O
too O
thick O
socks. B-TARGET

Cucumbers B-TARGET
burn I-TARGET
only O
one O
half O
per O
person. O

Very O
few O
sheep. B-TARGET

Very O
attentive O
and O
pleasant O
service, B-TARGET
food B-TARGET
in O
great O
quantity O
and O
good O
quality. O

The O
menus B-TARGET
are O
suitable O
for O
couples. O

By O
putting O
some O
"but" O
I O
will O
say O
that O
it O
is O
a O
good O
option O
for O
large O
groups O
rather O
than O
in O
pair O
for O
environmental O
noise. O

For O
the O
rest O
all O
fantastic. O

I O
ordered O
a O
menu. O

Very O
good O
quality B-TARGET
price. I-TARGET

Very O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

We O
will O
repeat. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
recommended O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
superior. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
complete. O

and O
a O
pero. O

When O
it O
is B-TARGET
full, I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
setting I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
room O
amplifies O
the O
noise. O

Good O
environment, B-TARGET
great O
food, B-TARGET
well B-TARGET
located. I-TARGET

Very O
highly O
recommended. O

It O
is O
an O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends. O

We O
will O
surely O
come O
back. O

We O
ate O
very O
well, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
was O
very O
welcoming. O

The O
only O
but O
to O
say O
something, O
that O
the O
first O
dish O
we O
wanted O
to O
collect O
almost O
without O
having O
finished, O
but O
then O
all O
great. O

We O
were O
invited O
to O
a O
jar O
of O
blood. O

Very O
recommended O

It O
was O
all O
very O
correct, O
but O
in O
principle O
it O
did O
not O
contain O
the O
previously O
made O
reservation. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
last O
week O
and O
it O
was O
all O
a O
discovery, O
although O
nobody O
asked O
for O
pizza B-TARGET
have O
a O
great O
look O
and O
their O
oven O
is O
wooden, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
try O
them... O

The O
site B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
they O
classify O
it O
as O
typical O
Catalan O
food O
and O
Mediterranean O
diet O
and O
in O
reality O
it O
is O
a O
pizzeria-grill O
in O
which O
there O
are O
also O
calçots O
served, O
climbing O
and O
soaked O
from O
the O
land. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
not O
expensive, O
but O
the O
local B-TARGET
is O
a O
little O
loose O
and O
lacking O
in O
light. O

and O
friendly O
service. B-TARGET

We O
asked O
shrimp O
that O
were O
on O
the O
letter O
and O
there O
was O
no, O
and O
lamb O
palette O
that O
there O
was O
as O
a O
suggestion O
and O
also O
not. O

At O
the O
end O
we O
ordered O
an O
entrecot B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
dry O
and O
it O
was O
small O
and O
a O
bullshit B-TARGET
(in O
which O
there O
were O
only O
4 O
bullshit) O
and O
it O
was O
also O
dry. O

We O
will O
not O
return. O

Everything O
was O
perfect, O
both O
the O
attention B-TARGET
of O
the O
staff O
and O
their O
products. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

I O
can’t O
enjoy O
more O
in O
Maur!The O
quality O
of O
their O
meats B-TARGET
and O
vegetables B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
breeze I-TARGET
is O
impressive! O

I’ve O
never O
tried O
a O
pizza B-TARGET
in O
the O
wooden O
oven O
so O
good. O

This O
Sunday O
15 O
March O
I O
move O
from O
Galicia O
with O
some O
friends O
to O
compete O
in O
the O
bcn O
marathon. O

As O
I O
am O
from O
the O
land, O
I O
told O
them O
to O
eat O
a O
calçotada O
so O
that O
they O
could O
try O
something O
that O
in O
Galicia O
is O
not O
common O
to O
eat. O

For O
logistical O
issues, O
look O
for O
a O
place O
inside O
bcn, O
near O
the O
hotel, O
although O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
eat O
at O
some O
store. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
a O
success. O

I O
love O
them O
all, O
very O
good, O
well O
done, O
and O
the O
meats, B-TARGET
potatoes, B-TARGET
strawberries B-TARGET
and O
scalpery, B-TARGET
really O
good. O

They O
were O
delighted, O
and O
I O
more. O

I O
love O
bringing O
people O
to O
my O
country O
and O
that O
they O
come O
back O
delighted O
with O
the O
treatment O
and O
people. O

Very O
recommended, O
both O
quality B-TARGET
and O
service. B-TARGET

Very O
good O
quality B-TARGET
and O
good O
attention. B-TARGET

The O
vegetables B-TARGET
and O
calçots B-TARGET
were O
very O
well O
made O
and O
tasty. O

I O
will O
repeat! O

CalÇots...and B-TARGET
Alcachofas...sublimes..I B-TARGET
think O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona O
city... O

Service B-TARGET
a O
little O
slow...but O
I O
understand O
that O
it O
was O
Friday O
night O
and O
we O
are O
going O
to O
have O
become O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
restaurants....(the B-TARGET
next O
a O
few O
pizzas...that O
seeing O
the O
one O
of O
our O
table O
neighbors....) O

We O
ate O
a O
calçots B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
that O
wasn’t O
bad O
but O
it O
wasn’t O
a O
miracle O
either. O

The O
quantity O
was O
good, O
but O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
meat B-TARGET
left O
a O
bit O
to O
be O
desired. O

As O
well O
as O
the O
romesco, B-TARGET
which O
was O
a O
bit O
"boat". O

The O
best, O
the O
taste O
of O
brasa O
and O
the O
abundant O
amount O
of O
calçots. B-TARGET

The O
speed O
of O
service. B-TARGET

Variety, O
quantity, O
and O
excellent O
quality-price O
ratio, O
to O
improve: O
the O
bread. B-TARGET

I O
am O
very O
fond O
of O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

The O
whole O
brasa B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
they O
serve O
you O
warm. O

For O
children, O
delicious O
croquettes B-TARGET
and O
good O
quality O
hamburgers. B-TARGET

I O
had O
once O
taken O
coffee O
with O
schoolmothers, O
and O
had O
a O
good O
perception O
of O
the O
site, O
clearly O
amparand O
me O
that O
I O
am O
on O
a O
terrace. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
we O
dined O
four O
people O
all O
coincided O
in O
the O
same, O
the O
little O
dynamism O
and O
sympathy O
of O
the O
service, B-TARGET
after O
dinner; O
the O
hot O
rice, O
the O
chipirones B-TARGET
could O
not O
know O
more O
to O
ammonia, O
the O
normal O
salad, B-TARGET
let’s O
do O
the O
best O
the O
ice O
cream B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
mandarin I-TARGET
and O
30 O
euros O
for O
that O
quality B-TARGET
is O
disproportionate O
altogether. O

not B-TARGET
come I-TARGET
back. I-TARGET

I O
was O
eating O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend O
yesterday. O

And O
I O
liked O
it O
a O
lot. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
well O
prepared. O

For O
dessert, O
I O
have O
a O
white B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
that O
I O
recommend. O

Very O
friendly O
and O
careful O
service, B-TARGET
I O
will O
be O
back. O

18 O
March O
2008. O

A O
grateful O
surprise. O

It’s O
like O
getting O
to O
the O
silver O
tacita. O

A O
surprising, O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
genero B-TARGET
as O
you O
can O
only O
find O
it O
in O
Cádiz O
and O
in O
the O
Port. O

We O
try O
the O
jamon, B-TARGET
the O
strawberries B-TARGET
and O
the O
rodaballo, B-TARGET
and O
it O
still O
makes O
my O
mouth O
water O
to O
remember O
it. O

It O
is O
an B-TARGET
indispensable I-TARGET
part O
of O
Zaragoza. O

The O
waitresses B-TARGET
are O
unprofessional O
and O
poorly O
educated. O

Prices B-TARGET
have I-TARGET
risen I-TARGET
considerably. I-TARGET

The O
terrace B-TARGET
is O
nice O
but O
details O
are O
missing. O

Well, O
we O
were O
last O
night O
1/08/09 O
dining, O
we O
booked O
for O
4 O
two O
couples, O
we O
were O
asking O
for O
a O
few O
rations O
and O
a O
second O
fish, O
but O
in O
the O
end O
we O
decided O
to O
share O
rations, O
the O
tomato O
to O
the O
Andalusian O
took O
it O
out O
of O
snack O
while O
we O
hoped O
(a O
detail) O
the O
truth O
that O
we O
asked O
for O
almost O
everything O
and O
everything O
was O
of O
good O
quality, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
White O
Fisherman, O
the O
truth O
that O
we O
stayed O
very O
well, O
the O
service B-TARGET
well O
and O
the O
price O
we O
thought O
we O
were O
going O
to O
go O
out O
more O
expensive O
to O
eat O
as O
of O
the O
rations, O
but O
it O
was O
quite O
adjusted, O
so O
I O
recommend O
it, O
the O
shrimp B-TARGET
that O
I O
had O
never O
tried O
I O
liked O
a O
lot. O

A O
quiet O
environment. B-TARGET

Kitchen B-TARGET
very O
well O
presented O
and O
quickly, O
everything O
at O
its O
point O
and O
well O
finished. O

The O
golden B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
style O
of O
the O
port O
very O
pleasant O
with O
a O
very O
well-finished O
sauce B-TARGET
although O
they O
presented O
it O
without O
scam O
and O
that O
was O
something O
unpleasant O
when O
enjoying O
it. O

Large O
and O
abundant O
rations. B-TARGET

The O
tomato, B-TARGET
as O
an O
entrance, O
is O
something O
special O
to O
highlight. O

The O
very O
good O
wine B-TARGET
and O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
puding I-TARGET
is O
something O
delicious O
although O
it O
was O
left O
with O
almost O
all O
the O
nata O
(boat) O
that O
it O
was O
accompanied; O
it O
would O
be O
worth O
considering O
another O
presentation. O

The O
price O
is O
not O
cheap O
but O
compared O
to O
sites O
where O
they’re O
pushing O
you O
badly, O
it’s O
worth O
it. O

The O
service B-TARGET
quiet O
and O
leaving O
you O
your O
way O
even O
though O
they O
do O
not O
take O
a O
look O
at O
your O
wishes. O

We O
think O
back. O

Ladies: O
There O
are O
several O
mistakes O
in O
the O
description O
you O
make O
here. O

In O
this O
restaurant O
we O
do O
not O
work O
the O
rap, O
the O
gamba O
are O
from O
the O
south O
of O
the O
Bay, O
the O
Langostinos O
of O
Sanlucar, O
everything O
referring O
to O
seafood O
and O
fisheries O
send O
us O
from O
Cádiz O
a O
seafood O
company, O
highlighting O
the O
shocks O
and O
the O
boiler. O

I O
recommend O
that O
you O
do O
not O
miss O
the O
tortillas O
in O
your O
meal O
and O
continue O
to O
enjoy O
this O
establishment. O

A O
little O
bit O
of O
Cadiz O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Zaragoza O

By O
the O
way, O
the O
tomatoes O
are O
from O
Almeria.And O
for O
the O
price, O
you O
don't O
even O
imagine O
the O
effort O
we O
make O
to O
adjust O
them, O
because O
bringing O
everything O
from O
there O
costs O
cloth, O
but O
it O
deserves O
to O
see O
our O
customers O
come O
out O
happy O
and O
happy O
with O
our O
products. O

A O
little O
bit O
of O
Cadiz O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
Zaagoz. O

For O
two O
people, O
I O
recommend O
a O
special B-TARGET
port I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
second I-TARGET
dish. I-TARGET

This O
way, O
the O
menu O
entries O
are O
shared O
for O
the O
two O
people. O

It O
seemed O
to O
me O
a O
bit O
expensive, O
maybe O
I’m O
not O
used O
to O
going O
to O
this O
type O
of O
restaurants. O

The O
quality B-TARGET
of O
the O
food O
was O
excellent, O
as O
was O
the O
personal B-TARGET
treatment. I-TARGET

There O
is O
no O
problem O
in O
going O
on O
a O
“normal” O
Saturday O
without O
booking O
in O
advance. O

I O
can’t O
add O
anything O
more O
than O
what O
I’ve O
read O
here. O

cordial O
greeting O

The O
[...] O

The O
dish O
of O
casserole O
in O
fertilizer, O
fried O
shocks, O
shrimp O
tortilla, O
fried O
boquerones, O
is O
that O
photo O
that O
appears O
with O
1 O
piece O
of O
casserole, O
3 O
shocks O
and O
1 O
boqueron? O

Is O
it O
that? O

Or O
was O
it O
an O
error? O

It O
is O
that O
the O
truth, O
reading O
the O
description, O
they O
want O
to O
go, O
but O
if O
it O
is O
then O
as O
it O
is O
seen O
in O
the O
photos, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
haircut. O

If O
anyone O
can O
remove O
my O
doubts, O
I O
would O
be O
grateful. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
dinner O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
and O
it O
wasn’t O
bad O
at O
all. O

I O
tasted O
the O
tomato O
to O
the O
Andalusian, O
some O
fried O
seafood, O
a O
bacon O
on O
the O
back O
and O
a O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
homemade O
(but O
not), O
typical O
prefabricated O
and O
uncongelated O
cake. O

To O
say O
that O
both O
the O
tomato B-TARGET
(very O
good) O
and O
the O
beets B-TARGET
were O
at O
their O
point, O
but O
there O
were O
several O
things O
that O
didn’t O
square. O

The O
strawberries B-TARGET
didn’t O
resemble O
the O
memory O
I O
had O
of O
those O
in O
Cádiz, O
there O
were B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
couple I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
people I-TARGET
smoking I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
non-smoking O
area, O
but O
the O
worst O
of O
all O
was O
the O
way O
we O
treated O
the O
“maitre”, B-TARGET
it O
was O
serious, O
dry, O
drizzle O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
two O
or O
three O
steps O
below O
the O
place O
where O
I O
worked, O
she O
was O
unwilling O
to O
our O
attention O
since O
she O
was O
seen O
all O
the O
time O
in O
the O
kitchen O
talking O
to O
another O
of O
her O
companions. O

Hello O
good O
thanks O
to O
all O
the O
people O
who O
have O
put O
these O
comments O
because O
this O
the O
truth O
lets O
you O
know O
the O
good O
and O
the O
bad O
that O
has O
the O
restaurant O
but O
I O
recommend O
to O
all O
people O
this O
restaurant O
because O
very O
few O
restaurants O
in O
Zaragoza O
have O
pruductos O
that O
has O
the O
port O
such O
as O
the O
fish O
is O
of O
very O
high O
quality O
and O
the O
meat O
is O
very O
good O
that O
is O
of O
denomination O
of O
origin O
and O
there O
are O
very O
tasty O
dishes O
and O
the O
good O
thing O
that O
has O
the O
restaurant O
is O
that O
it O
prepares O
its O
delightful O
dishes O
at O
the O
moment O
never O
prepares O
the O
food O
and O
then O
heats O
up O
and O
with O
a O
time O
just O
for O
the O
customer O
and O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cleaning O
in O
the O
kitchen O
and O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
care O
with O
the O
fish O
and O
other O
pruductos O
and O
with O
excellent O
homemade O
desserts O
such O
as O
cheese, O
pasiega O
pudin O
of O
fruits, O
butterballs O
macerated O
in O
strawberry O
wine, O
imperial O
tarta O
of O
almonds O
and O
chocolate, O
etc. O

thanks O
to O
the O
customers O
the O
truth O
is O
you O
that O
you O
will O
let O
us O
prepare O
things O
with O
all O
our O
affection O
and O
love O
so O
that O
when O
you O
have O
finished O
eating O
tell O
us O
this O
is O
all O
excellent O
and O
that O
is O
what O
leaves O
us O
want O
more O
to O
the O
kitchen O
and O
continue O
with O
new O
ideas, O
thanks O
and O
greetings O

On O
15/03/14 O
I O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
the O
family O
to O
what O
I O
thought O
was O
still O
a O
good O
restaurant. B-TARGET

What O
a O
disappointment. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
was O
worth O
it O
was O
a O
portion B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
jam I-TARGET
and O
FOUR B-TARGET
banderillas. I-TARGET

The O
boiler B-TARGET
(bienmesabe) O
was O
neither O
boiler O
nor O
bienmesabe O
was O
multivitamin O
typoon O
(this O
was O
what O
they O
told O
me). O

The O
cockroaches B-TARGET
and O
refrigerators. O

The O
golden B-TARGET
bacon I-TARGET
was O
a O
typical O
bacon O
revolt. O

But O
the O
star O
took O
it O
what O
in O
the O
letter O
was O
“Ventresca O
salad, O
piquillo O
and O
onion” O
we O
requested O
to O
change O
the O
piquillo O
for O
tomato O
and O
brought O
us O
“salad O
with O
various O
leaches, O
piquillos, O
onion, O
asparagus, O
a O
peel O
of O
ventresca O
and O
a O
TOMATITO O

Okay, B-TARGET
I I-TARGET
will I-TARGET
not I-TARGET
come O
back. O

Look O
at O
this O
piece.María O

[...] O
Saturday O
I O
was O
dining O
at O
the O
new O
Q-Art B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
(click O
to O
see O
the O
review), O
disastrous, O
I O
will O
not O
return. O

Has O
anyone O
been O
there? O
[...] O

I’ve O
been O
here O
several O
times O
and O
I O
and O
my O
guests O
have O
always O
come O
out O
very O
satisfied. O

On O
the O
issue O
of O
smoke B-TARGET
I O
can't O
comment O
since O
I O
have O
never O
been O
with O
the O
restaurant O
full, O
as O
long O
as O
I O
went O
was O
seed O
and O
there O
was O
no O
smoke O
problem. O

I O
understand O
that O
you O
are O
so O
dissatisfied O
with O
what O
you O
describe. O

About O
the O
food, B-TARGET
what O
do O
you O
want O
to O
tell O
you, O
you O
yourself O
say O
that O
the O
quality O
is O
very O
good, O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
variety, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
treatment I-TARGET
quite O
good, O
with O
many O
details O
of O
the O
house. O

The O
price B-TARGET
for O
me O
is O
very O
adjusted, O
especially O
comparing O
with O
other O
similar O
restaurants, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
quality/price O
ratio O
in O
Zaragoza O
without O
being O
a O
innovative O
kitchen B-TARGET
or O
aspiring O
to O
the O
highest O
quality. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
Aragonese B-TARGET
cava, I-TARGET
please O
no! O

I O
will O
not O
say O
that O
there O
are O
no O
bad O
Catalan O
cavas, O
that O
there O
are, O
but O
in O
general O
the O
Aragonese O
are O
very O
bad O
and O
their O
price O
has O
gone O
to O
the O
clouds, O
I O
think O
above O
all O
for O
their O
increased O
consumption O
due O
to O
political O
ones. O

We O
had O
dinner O
at O
this O
restaurant O
yesterday O
and O
it O
was O
really O
delicious. O

The O
sardines B-TARGET
are O
spectacular. O

The O
miniature B-TARGET
is O
the O
same. O

The O
apple B-TARGET
cake, I-TARGET
hummmm. O

We O
really O
love O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
the O
treatment. B-TARGET

Totally O
advisable. O

Congratulations O
to. O

Small O
and O
cozy O
dining B-TARGET
room.We O
ate O
very O
pleasantly O
my O
partner O
and O
I. O

I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
there O
is O
quality, O
treatment B-TARGET
and O
attention B-TARGET
from O
those O
responsible O
for O
the O
improved O
restaurant. O

The O
golden B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
and O
the O
eggs B-TARGET
well O
cooked O
vegetables. O

Generally O
good O
price, B-TARGET
good O
cuisine, B-TARGET
good O
service. B-TARGET

A O
correct O
choice. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
I O
booked O
in O
El O
Real, O
and O
the O
experience B-TARGET
has O
been O
very O
good, O
both O
the O
gentle O
treatment O
of O
the O
lady B-TARGET
who O
served O
our O
table, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
food B-TARGET
that O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
excellent. O

We O
chose O
a O
tasting O
menu, B-TARGET
with O
appetizer, B-TARGET
entrance, B-TARGET
a O
fish, B-TARGET
a O
meat B-TARGET
and O
two O
desserts, B-TARGET
and O
all O
of O
them O
very O
well O
presented O
and O
really O
was O
all O
very O
good, O
even O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
with O
honey O
was O
at O
its O
point. O

It O
was O
a O
pleasant O
experience. B-TARGET

Totally B-TARGET
recommended. I-TARGET

We O
ate O
the O
menu B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
delicious O
and O
very O
good O
price. O

Great O
location B-TARGET
and O
staff. B-TARGET

One O
is O
right. O

I O
made O
the O
reservation O
through O
this O
page O
and O
booked O
the O
Daily O
Menu. O

When O
I O
arrived, O
with O
an O
accompaniment, O
they O
offered O
me O
the O
letter, O
instead O
of O
the O
Menu. O

I O
had O
to O
say O
that O
I O
had O
a O
menu O
reservation O
and O
I O
was O
still O
denied O
it. O

I O
actually O
had O
to O
show O
the O
booking O
confirmation O
I O
had O
on O
the O
mobile. O

Frankly, O
I O
didn’t O
like O
the O
deal. B-TARGET

But O
in O
addition, O
the O
two O
dishes B-TARGET
I O
ate O
were O
frankly O
bad, O
they O
weren’t O
well O
prepared O
(scalable O
toast O
with O
strawberry O
and O
brassed O
mercury). O

And O
finally, O
when O
we O
ordered O
the O
coffee, O
we O
were O
warned O
that O
we O
were O
quick.Finally, O
very O
bad O
service B-TARGET
and O
bad O
food. B-TARGET

I O
will O
not O
return. O

Very O
good, O
I O
recommend O
it. O

for O
the O
guirls. O

It O
was, O
but O
it O
is O
no O
longer. O

was O
fantastic O
the O
service B-TARGET
the O
food B-TARGET
the O
little B-TARGET
details I-TARGET
the O
truth O
at O
a O
very O
high O
height. O

The O
reservation O
was O
made O
for O
15:30. O

Until O
16:15 O
we O
were O
not O
awarded O
the O
table. O

The O
excuse O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
has O
been O
that O
on O
January O
1st O
there O
is O
always O
a O
lot O
of O
work. O

We O
do O
not O
understand O
why O
we O
were O
made O
to O
choose O
between O
the O
first O
and O
the O
second O
turn O
when O
making O
the O
reservation. O

We O
don’t O
even O
understand O
why O
we O
made O
the O
reservation O
because O
the O
tail O
we O
suffered O
the O
same. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
restaurants O
that O
also O
have O
a O
double O
turn O
and O
never O
had O
anything O
like O
this O
happened O
to O
us. O

They O
blame O
the O
customer. O

More O
recall: O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
they O
called O
us O
to O
confirm O
the O
reservation...for O
what? O

I O
ate O
very O
well O
and O
I O
was O
very O
well O
served O
by O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
who O
served O
me O
was O
very O
attentive O
to O
everything. O

All O
excellent O
except O
the O
place B-TARGET
where O
we O
put O
the O
table O
on O
Christmas O
day: O
in O
the O
carp! O

Given O
that O
I O
was O
with O
2 O
very O
older O
people O
was O
not O
the O
ideal O
place B-TARGET
to O
accommodate O
us. O

He O
also O
told O
me O
that O
one O
of O
them O
was O
in O
a O
wheelchair. O

I O
don’t O
understand O
why O
they O
didn’t O
reserve O
us O
the O
table O
in O
a O
closed O
space O
with O
the O
number O
of O
lounges O
they O
have. O

We O
were O
placed O
on O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
without O
prior O
notice. O

In O
the O
table O
were O
missing O
3 O
covers, O
having O
previously O
confirmed O
the O
number O
of O
beginners O
on O
the O
same O
day. O

There O
was O
an O
excessively O
high O
noise B-TARGET
level, O
very O
annoying O
and O
from O
the O
menu B-TARGET
we O
hired O
almost O
didn’t O
see O
a O
dish, O
practically, O
they O
brought O
us O
practically O
what O
they O
wanted. O

Great O
service B-TARGET
and O
my O
guests O
were O
impressed. O

Everything O
was O
very O
well O

Of O
the O
best O
paellas B-TARGET
I’ve O
tried, O
and O
the O
impeccable O
service. B-TARGET

It O
is O
a O
pleasant O
place B-TARGET
of O
Barcelona O
to O
know, O
unparalleled O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(but O
noisy, O
not O
for O
an O
intimate O
dinner) O
and O
cosmopolitan. O

The O
service B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters, O
excellent, O
very O
professional. O

The O
paella B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
best, O
although O
not O
the O
best O
in O
Barcelona, O
excess O
tomato O
and O
therefore O
acidic, O
but O
rich. O

Excellent O
fish B-TARGET
and O
meat, B-TARGET
but O
of O
course, O
high O
prices. O

Too O
fast, O
too O
many O
people. B-TARGET

It O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
want O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it!! O

It O
is O
chaotic! B-TARGET

Everything O
is O
perfect. O

Good O
service B-TARGET
and O
good O
food. B-TARGET

Very O
recommended. O

What O
a O
wonderful O
memory O
I O
have O
of O
this O
place! B-TARGET

Not O
bad O
as O
I O
started. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
restaurant O
where O
I O
was O
taken O
to O
eat O
when O
I O
landed O
in O
Barcelona. O

First O
“business” O
meal B-TARGET
and O
my O
taste O
memory O
reminds O
me O
perfectly O
of O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
fried B-TARGET
fish, I-TARGET
paella.. B-TARGET
The O
treatment B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
staff O
is O
remarkable, O
they O
are O
always O
watching O
that O
nothing O
is O
missing O
on O
the O
table. O

There O
is O
usually O
bread O
with O
tomatoes O
and O
jamon. O

is O
the O
best O

Very O
strange O
with O
the O
comments O
below, O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites, O
as O
long O
as O
friends O
come O
we O
take O
them O
there, O
the O
treatment B-TARGET
is O
immeasurable O
and O
the O
owner O
is O
very O
dear, O
kind O
integrates O
with O
the O
people. O

The O
food B-TARGET
has O
always O
been O
very O
good, O
I O
think O
these O
people O
have O
been O
unlucky O
because O
I O
actually O
go O
two O
or O
three O
times O
a O
year O
and O
always O
slago O
happy. O

Paella B-TARGET
very O
rich O
and O
very O
attentive O
waiters. B-TARGET

We O
were O
very O
happy. O

We O
were O
treated O
very O
well, O
human O
treatment, B-TARGET
they O
gave O
us O
a O
double O
round O
of O
drinks. O

We O
ate O
some O
generous O
rice B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
some O
entrances B-TARGET
based O
on O
steam O
berberechos, O
gamba O
de O
Huelva O
and O
varied O
Andalusian O
friduria O
quite O
good. O

But O
I O
insist, O
the O
deal B-TARGET
was O
the O
best. O

and O
the O
kitchen. O

No O
dish O
was O
right. O

Quality O
of O
a O
humble O
neighborhood O
bar O
at O
the O
price O
of O
a O
Michelin O
star O
restaurant O

+ O
the O
service O

Good O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
service. B-TARGET

I O
recommend O
it. O

Very O
good O
quality O
price B-TARGET

We O
ordered O
the O
pica B-TARGET
pica I-TARGET
specialty O
of O
the O
house: O
it O
was O
served O
cold, O
oily O
and O
poorly O
shaped O
lime, O
sardines O
refined...dirty. O

It O
was O
even O
worse O
because O
then O
came O
the O
paella B-TARGET
parellada O
bathed O
in O
oil, O
past O
time...I O
think O
it O
was O
an O
artoz O
boiled O
in O
oil. O

to O
forget. O

Last O
summer O
I O
dined O
at O
this O
restaurant O
as O
we O
went O
to O
the O
cinema O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
friends O
and O
before O
we O
decided O
to O
eat O
there. O

I O
said O
at O
the O
beginning O
that O
I O
don’t O
like O
buffet O
restaurants, O
but O
I O
gave O
in. O

I’d O
rather O
have O
a O
few O
things O
and O
come O
and O
serve O
me O
at O
the O
table. O

That O
of O
getting O
up O
to O
go O
for O
dishes O
completely O
breaks O
off O
being O
with O
your O
friends O
quietly O
and O
without O
cuts. O

I O
don’t O
like O
having O
to O
wait O
for O
them O
to O
do O
something O
on O
the O
board. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
menu O
is O
concerned, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
“put O
your O
boots” O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
fine. O

I O
especially O
value O
quality O
over O
quantity. O

Despite O
this, O
the O
price B-TARGET
quality I-TARGET
ratio I-TARGET
is O
very O
good. O

It’s O
not O
about O
the O
food O
I O
wanted O
to O
talk O
about. O

I O
wanted O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
lighting B-TARGET
of O
the O
room. O

The O
light B-TARGET
is O
fluorescent O
type O
white O
and O
gives O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
eating O
in O
a O
corporate O
cantine. O

He O
is O
not O
welcoming, O
very O
cold O
emotionally O
and O
nothing O
intimate. O

I O
think O
that O
if O
they O
spaced O
the O
tables O
a O
little O
and O
changed O
the O
lighting O
for O
something O
warmer O
the O
local O
would O
gain O
a O
lot, O
but O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
not O
aimed O
at O
the O
public O
that O
is O
fixed O
on O
the O
details O
and O
wants O
to O
be O
comfortable O
when O
eating. O

Frankly, O
this O
is O
a O
place B-TARGET
that O
is O
not O
worth O
it. O

A O
lot O
of O
poster, O
very O
modern, O
a O
lot O
of O
space, O
to O
put O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
then O
the O
rest O
leaves O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
choosing O
the O
Wok B-TARGET
of O
Via O
Universitas O
without O
any O
doubt, O
it O
is O
near O
here. O

Much O
better O
in O
everything, O
and O
if O
I O
don’t O
remember O
badly O
even O
cheaper. O
